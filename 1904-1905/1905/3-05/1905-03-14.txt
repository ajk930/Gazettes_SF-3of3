RUSSIAN DEAD STREW THE ENTIRE ROUTE
OF RETREAT FROM MUKDEN TO TIE PASS
ST. PETERSBURG, March 14. â Latest advices from Tie Pass indicate that the bulk of the Russian
army has reached that refuge and is rapidly fortifying to check the Japanese pursuit. The rear guard,
which has been righting as it fell back, is now only a few miles distant. Kuropatkin is still directing
this force, whose Josses while protecting the retreat of the disorganized army and saving the
irtillery have been enormous. Every acre of ground between Mukden and the battle line of the rear
guard is strewn with dead. The wounded are being sent to Tie Pass. Japanese soldiers are swarming
northward on both flanks, intent upon surrounding Tie Pass.

OYAMA'S ARMIES
MAY YET CAPTURE
SLAV COMMANDER
Kuropatkin Left
With Hut 100,
000 Troops.
ESCAPE CUT OFF
Retreating Force
Brought to Bay
at Tie Pass.
The Russian general staff reports
that "the main body has already com
pleted its retreat and the rear guard
southward is falling back slowly."
What , eithen the ' "main, body" or
the "rear guard" consists of has not
been, definitely : Ilxed, but from ; the
dispatches from - the â  press correspond
ents with the Japanese; and Russians
the two combined | must â¢be but a : small
portion i;. of the;' army, â¢ which General
Kuropatkin had gathered : along v the
barks of and Hun rivers.
And yet L those who have reached Tie
Pass, worn out - from - many days rof
fighting and retreating, .are not out
of danger, the Japanese, it is reported,
having already s started . another â  turn
ing movement, which will force r the
Russians on to the plains north of
Tie Pass, where, in their disorganized
state, they | would be easy.; prey ' for the
victory-flushed soldiers of the Mikado.
The men who escaped are strengthen
ing; the fortifications in Tie Pass, but
it is hardly possible that the pass can
be held in the t face of . the â¢ overwhelm
ing forces -opposed .: to ; the Russians,
and it is not likely that 'Oyama\will
rest satisfied with his victory at Muk
den, ;as he did after- Liaoyang. . ;-,-' â¢â  i "^. â¢
There -will tje no uneasiness as to
the food supply as long as communica
tions are maintained to the north
ward, as large bands of cattle roam
the plains, under Cossack herders, and
every station on the railway is a huge
commissariat department. The Rus
sian soldiers are always well fed, the
soup kitchen on wheels always keep
ing in touch with the men. .
As to the losses, General Kuropat
kin now admits that Â«>O,OOO wounded
wore carried off the field. This, with
the 26, 500 dead left on the fielri, the
40,000 prisoners and the wounded left
In the hospitals. comes somewhat
nearer the latest Japanese estimate
that the total Russian losses were
15 5,000. At this rate Kuroputkin can
not htr.e more than 100,000 effective
fighting; men with him.
The army of General Linevitch seems
to have made the best retreat, but this
no doubt was due to the stubborn fight
made by General Rennenkampff on his
extreme left and the equally fierce re
sistance of General Kaulbars on the
right, the latter general losing 25.000
men. ,
Neither the army of Kaulbars nor
that of Rennenkampff has yet been
accounted for by the dispatches. After
his defeat around the Western tombs,
Kaulbars, finding his retreat directly
northward cut off, made a detour to
the eastward, where he was still fight
ing at last accounts. Rennenkampff
also must still be in the hills to the
eastward, as It took a press courier
three days to reach Tie Pass.
The Japanese report the capture of
twenty-four more guns â sixty-six in all,
a rather small number considering
the decisive defeat and the number of
men captured. The Japanese losses
have been remarkably light. In view of
the length and severity of the fighting.
In all the speculation as to peace the
one point that is coming to the front
is that Russia would prefer to settle
directly with Japan without the aid of
any third nation. This is in line with
the dream of many leading Russians,
that the natural allies in the Far Ea6t
are Japan and Russia, they being the
only nations whose domains border on
Korea and Manchuria, both having in
terests besides those of trade.
NOT YET OUT OF TRAP.
Russian Army Likely to Be Sur-
rounded at Tie Pass.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 13.â 1t is to be war
to the knife between the "big five"
of the beef combine and twenty-six
firms and corporations classed as in
dependent packers The fight for a
standing in the courts and before the
public will be begun in Chicago on
March 20, when the special Federal
Grand Jury will begin its investiga
tion of the affairs or the alleged beef
combination. A funH of $3,000,<W0 has
been raised to carry on the fight
against the beef combine and to set
the claims of the independent packers
squarely before the American people.
Tht independent packers are under
stood to have held meetings in Kansas
City the latter part of last w^ek. These
conferences were called to devise plans,
offensive and defensive, so that when
the Federal Grand Jury takes up the
subject one week from to-day they
will be in a position to defend their
business interests against any allega
tions which may be charged against
them by the "trust," which is said to
be seeking a means of shifting the re
sponsibility for the present infraction
â¢f the anti-trust law.
The Kansas City conferences of last
week were transferred to Chicago on
Saturday and were continued to-day.
The leaders of the â¢independent" co
terie met during the forenoon and this
afternoon in the First National Bank
building. John Sulzberger, resident
vice president of Schwarzchild & Sulz
berger, the largest of the independent
packers, attended the conference.
When questioned afterward he refusea
to discuss the subject of the Govern
ment investigation.
Joseph Weissenbach. attorney for
the Schwarzchild & Sulzberger Com
pany, was asked:
"How about the story that the "S.
and S. people have been offered $22.
000,000 by the trust for their business?"
"I know nothing about that," said
Weissenbach. "See Mr. Sulzberger."
More than two hundred subpenas
have been issued by the Federal au
thorities for the forthcoming inquiry by
the Grand Jury. Among these are a
number which have been served on the
"independents" at their own request,
it is said. They are reported to have
given information to the secret service
department in Washington, under John
E. Wilkie, to Captain Porter and his
m*n of the samp department in Chi

CHICAGO. March 13. â Professor
Albion W. Small spoke at the Junior
College Chapel service at the Univer
sity of Chicago to-day and advanced
some ideas which caused comment.
"It is conceivable that a gambling
house keeper cr prizefighter may have
a motive which is as religious as that
of the truly devout man," said he.
"For instance, the prizefighter who
thinks the men of his day are becom
ing effeminate and good for nothing
but to smoke cigarettes may resolve
to better the condition of the men by
preaching the strenuous gospel and in
so doing have a motive which is re
ligious, although unknown as such to
the world."

TUCSON, Ariz., March ICâ The po
lice officers have unearthed what they
believe to be a suicide club amons a
certain coterie of young men and
women in this city. Two weeks ago a
young girl of good family. Lena Oc-hoa,
blew out her brains with a revolver;
a few months ago her sister committed
suicide in the same fashion. Last
night Jose M. Paredes, a friend of the
Ochoas and a pallbearer at the funeral

WASHINGTON BELIEVES RUSSIA AND JAPAN ARE ON VERGE OF PEACE
TOKIO IS NOW READY
TO NAME THE TERMS
Awaits Assurance That They
Will Be Considered.
â T. 'X. March 13.â When
the Czai calls his War Council to-mor
row he â¢â¢II be able to inform it that
Japan will welcome peace on reason
able terms and will promptly name her
conditions, provided she receive trust
worthy assurances that they will be
seriously considered.
Th;.- the Emperor has learned from
friendiy chancellories in Europe, as
well as the general terms acceptable to
Japan. These, it is said, include the
retention by Japan of Port Arthur, a
Japanese protectorate over Korea, and
an indemnity.
From a high official the press hears
that Russia has recalled her second
Pacific squadron.
An attache of a Russian embassy in
Europe is quoted as having expressed
thÂ»- belief that Kuropatkin's recent de
feat will force Russia to ask for peace.
Briefly, these were the reports cur
rent in the diplomatic corps to-day,
and as a result of this important in
formation official Washington believes
to-night that Russia and Japan are on
th^ verge of peace. If it be true that
the serond Pacific squadron has been
recalled, even the most optimistic
friends of Russia admit that this is a
strong indication that Oyaraa's mighty
blow has made for peace.
Count Cassini. the Russian Embas
sador. is the notable exception in the
group of foreign envoys here. Said he:
However generous the terms which Japan
ir.ipht offer. Russian prestige if not amongr
them. That ie one thing for which the war
will be fougrht to the end. Victory for the
Ruffian srirs will alone make for peace. If
nor at Tie Pass, then at Harbin. Russia will
U'&emtU- another army mightier than before
and with tlist army ehe will settle the Issue.
It may be fix months, a year, or perhaps two
years. Time will be ro consideration.
At the Japanese legation it is'de
clared that St. Petersburg and not
Tokio is the capital from which the
world must hone for peace proposals.
Takahira. the Japanese Minister, said
to-day in the most emphatic manner
that Japan had not directly proposed
peace.
If the Japanese Government were as
sured that peace proposals would be
considered by Russia, there is author
ity for the statement that Japan would
respond immediately. But she will in
sist that these assurances shall be of
the most positive character.
Officials here expect that by to-mor
row St. Petersburg will have fully com
prehended the extent of Oyama's vic
tory and then will make known its
decision regarding the continuance of
thf war after Mukden's fall.
A diplomat representing one of the
neutral powers most interested in the
final issue has within the last two

to my notice some time ago an un-
doubted case of kidney and bladder
trouble, where the party was so an-
noyed from the kidney secretions,
particularly at night, that it entailed
loss of sleep and as a consequence
lack of energy ensued the following
day. The kidney secretions con-
tained so much acid that they scald-
ed: in fact, sometimes were particu-

ment oi Doan's Kidney Pills was
taken, and. much to the surprise of
the party and more to his gratifica-
tion, the incontinence ceased."

Kuropntkin" 1 - Dispntrlies Do Not
Minimize thr Defeat.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 13.~ Gen
eral Kuropatkin. in a dispatch dated
March 12. says 50.000 Russians were
wounded during the last few days'
fighting.
A (iipiiatch from General Kuropat
kin. dated March 11. says:
"The enemj- is receiving general re-
LBfercemetitk. Examination of the
wounded and the prisoners shows Gen
eral NÂ«'pi had almost entirely fresh
force?. Th^ Japanese are always able
to kep;i thei: forces up to full fighting
strength, because of the ease with
uhi<h they are able to transport troops
from Japan."
in a dispatch datfd March
eral Kuropatkin says;
"Aci-ording to reports from* the rear
guard, a Japanese force consisting of
a division and a half is within a short
distance of the Russian reru guard.
"The Second Army is marching con
tinually under the fire of the enemy,
who is advancing from the east and
west."
General Kuropatkin adds' that the
rear guard advanced in perfect order,
but that the movement of the trans
port along the Mandarin road was
very difficult, owing to the Japanese
cannonade. The country between Tie
Pass and Mukden is intercircled by riv
ers and steer> banks and the Russian
wagons were obliged to halt and await
their turn, causing much delay.
General Kuropatkin compliments the
Japanese intelligence department. He
says:
Thanks to the organization of the
intelligence department and their re
connaissance, the Japanese always
knew the positions occupied by our
army.
"The First Regiment of Siberian rifles
had the most serious fighting. It
marched under the Japanese fire from
east and west almost continuously.
Colonel Loesel succeeded in extricating
three officer? and 150 men of the reg
iment, with its colors and one battery.
In the battle of ' March 6 the regiment
lost more than 1000 men.
"Reports are coming in of heavy
losses by other divisions, notably the
Yurieff regiment of the Twenty-fifth
division, of which only two officers and
619 of the rank and file are left. "
General Linevitchs army, although
its units were scattered and confused,
got off with the fewest losses. General
Kaulbars was the heaviest loser, leav
ing 25,000 prisoners in the hands of the
Japanese. Kaulbars himself, with the
remnant of his army, had a narrow
escape. When the Japanese drove
their wedge across the railroad above
Mukden he just managed to pull clear
by withdrawing south of the city and
then moving northeastward into the
mountains barely in time to avoid Gen
eral Kuroki's columns, which were al
ready at the Hun River, bombarding:
Fu Pass. According to the latest ad
vifvs General Kaulbars is being pur
sued and has not succeeded in extri
cating himself from the mountains.

ST. PETERSBURG. March 14. â A

NOT YET OUT
OF THE TRAP
Continued From Page 1, Column 4.
of further information it is difficult to
say whether the pursuit has slackened
or in being conducted by only a portion
of the Japanese, and military officials
here hope that, as at the battle of
Liaoyang, Field Marshal Oyama has
paused to give his weary troops a mo
mentary breathing spell, while extend
ing his railroad and other, lines of sup
ply to his new position and preparing
for the next blow.
To the Russian army every minute
is now valuable and the footsore and
disheartened detachments have been
given scarcely an hour's rest before
being set at work improving the de
fenses of the pass. It may be, how 1
evei, that even now they are being
turned out of those positions. Rumors
are current that a wide eastward flank
ing movement, which was begun before
tht battle, is still in -rogress, and on
the other side it is feared that columns
are moving north of Fakoman to take
a position in the Russian rear.
General Kuropatkin still holds com
mand. An officer of the general staff
said to-day that he probably would not
retire until some semblance of order
had been restored. The question of his
successor is still undetermined.
There are indications tirat the food
supply at Tie Pass is none too large,
immense quantities having been burned
at Mukden, and Russian correspond
ents telegraph that they have had noth
ing to eat for two days. The troops,
however, probably are faring bet
tor. The commissariat arrangements
worked admirably during the battle
and even at the height of the fighting
the soldiers received warm food.
Telegrams from the Russian side,
though inadequate as a basis for any
detailed estimate of the Russian losses,
show that they have been extremely
heavyâ enough to cripple offensive
operations for many months. General
Kuropatkin admits that 50.000 wounded
were carried off. but says nothing as
to bow many killed, wounded or pris
oners were left behind: and from his
picture of a little handful of two offi
cers and 150 men of the Imperial
RinVs marching off, led by their gal
lant colonel, clinging to their stand
ard, can be derived some idea of the
losses sustained by the regiments that
bore the brunt of the fighting. The
expl-nt of the 600 at Balaklava pales
besides this. Even the losses in the
"bloody angle" of the Wilderness and
in the battle of Antietam are scarcely
comparable.
Another tragic picture of the retreat
is related ln connection with the retire
ment of General RennenkampfT 9 de
tachment from Oubenepusa with bare
ly one-third of its original strength,
the brave soldiers breaking down and
sobbing and kissing the blood-stained
eround which they had been ordered to
relinquish.
The loss of officers is said to have
been especially heavy and many of the
higher and more capable orricers were
killed.
ANSWERS RrRSfA'S CHARGE.
Tokio Denies a Violation of the Neu-
trality of China.
WASHINGTON, March IX. â From
the Foreign Office at Tokio the Jap
anese legation has received a dispatch
bearing on the report that the Russian
Government has again drawn the at
tention of the powers with a statement
to the effect that the Japanese troops
were guilty of a violation of China's
neutrality, as their appearance behind
the Russian army in the western part
of Fentian province must have been
effected by taking a route through
Mongolia.
"As a matter of fact." the Japanese
dispatch from Tokio says, "the im
perial forces have never passed
through Mongolian territory, while
Rissia has long been drawing supplies
from Mongolia and always hag been
sending there disguised armed troops,
which, intimidating native Princes and
people, have caused them to render as
sistance to the Russians ln the rear."

KUROPATKIN DECEIVED
BY OYAMA'S STRATEGY
Correspondent Explains Great
Disaster at Mukden.
WITH GENERAL KUROKI'S
ARMY, NORTHEAST OF MUKDEN,
Sunday, March 12. â Every hour in
creases the magnitude of the disaster
suffered by the Russian armies.
To-night 25,000 dead are known to
have been left on the field, making the
casualties at least 100,000.
Between 50,000 and 60.U00 prisoners,
some seventy guns and enormous quan
tities of ammunition and provisions fell
into the hands of the Japanese.
The Japanese losses do not exceed
those of former great battles, even
General Kuroki's army losing only 5000
men.
Field Marshal Oyama's plans com
pletely deceived General Kuropatkin.
The Russian commander misjudged the
positions and strength of the Japanese.
He at first believed that General Nogi's
Port Arthur army was pressing his
east flank and concentrated a great
force there. This force he was after
ward obliged to shift to Mukden, where
it arrived in a state of exhaustion after
a forced march and was unable to
fight. '
The retreat from Mukden began on
March 9. it became a demoralized
flight when the Russians discovered
that their egress, was being blocked by
Japanese infantry and artillery from
the east. The rapid approach of the
Japanese was a complete surprise to
the Russians, who expected that their
retreat would be harassed only by Jap
anese cavalry from the westward.
Yesterday (Saturday) morning one
division of Japanese encountered sev
eral Russian regiments retreating along
the road to Tie Pass. The Japanese de
scended from the hills upon the Rus
sians, who attempted to break through
the line. After a sharp engagement, in
which the Japanese guns did great ex
ecution, 4000 Russians surrendered,
with ten guns. The Japanese lost 100
men.
According to stories told by the cap
tured Russian officers and the appear
ance presented by their troops, the re
treat lacks organization, every battal
ion shifting for itself.

TIENTSIN, March 13.â The Chinese
railway administration has withdrawn
the locomotives and other rolling stock
from the line between Sinmintin,
Koupangtze and Yinkow.
It is said in high quarters here that
the Chinese are justified in taking this
course, as the high-handed action of
the Japanese in endeavoring to force
them to violate neutrality by carrying
contraband of war left thorn no alter

the loss of revenue will be a serious
one, probably resulting in the deterior

Claim That Monetary Reform Will

CITY OF MEXICO, March 13.â
Tho principal mining men of the
country will meet in this city in con
vention to-morrow when the silver
miners win frame a petition to the
Government, asking for relief from
taxation in view of the fact that the
monetary reform will close the mints
of the republic to the free coinage of
silver. The tax on silver is often two
fold. There is a federal tax and some
times a municipal tax. The miners
urge that the closing of the mints
will reduce silver to the level of any
other commodity and that it is unjust
that a heavy tax should weigh upon
the industry.
The Government is in sympathy
with the mining interests and is dis
posed to do all in its power to lighten
the burden mentioned.

Chief of Police Wittman. charged
with incompetency and neglect of duty,
commenced his defense before the
Board of Police Commissioners last
night. Many witnesses testified as to
the Chief's efficiency and the con
sensus of opinion was that Wittman
was not only the best executive Dolice
official San Francisco has ever had, but
that he was the superior of any offi
cial in a similar position in the United
States. High Government officials at
tacked the reputation of the so-called
Educational Society, whose members
seem to be taking an active Interest in
the prosecution of Wittman. and old
policemen, experienced in Chinatown
matters, gave estimates of the number
of men that would be required to sup
press gambling in that section. An ad
journment was taken until this even
ing.
J. R. Howell, whose term as Police
Commissioner expired at the berinning
of this year, said that Wittman was a
competent Chief and an honorable
man; that he never neglected his duty
and that the San Francisco Police De
partment did not have an equal in the
country. Inspector of the Chinese Bu
reau Charles Meehan said that the Ed
ucational Society had a bad standinr
with his department, and that it had
tried to smuggle Chinese women Into
the country unlawfully. Mose Gunst.
ex-Commissioner, complimented Witt
man highly and told how this depart
ment compared with that of other cit
ies.
George A. Newhall. former chairman
of the board, said that Wittman was
the most capable Chief this city has
ever had. He said that the Chiefs abil
ity had been praised tat police officials
of every large city, and related the
compliments paid to the Chief by both
President McKinley and President
Roosevelt. Newhall never knew Witt
man to neglect his duty. Charles L.
Field, W. Frank Pierce, H. D. Love
land, Colonel Frank W. Sumner and
George B. Clark all testified as to the
efficient manner in which Wittman
handled the crowds during the Knijrhts
Templar conclave held in this cltv last
September. Sumner mentioned the dec
oration from King Edward, which was
presented the Chief by the Earl of Eus
ton.
W. H. Barnes and E. H. Black had
the same to say of the Chief in re
gard to the Odd Fellows' parade. Rea
gan asked Sumner if he relieved Witt
man to be capable of suppressing
gambling in Chinatown. Bumner re
plied that if the Chief is as successful
in closing games as he is at handling
crowds the former must be out of
existence. Jesse D. Fuller and J. W.
Harris of the G A. R. and Rufus P.
Jennings, chairman of the citizens'
committee during tie visit of President
Roosevelt, both testified to Wlttman's .
ability in restraining crowds and pre- !
serving order. Achilles Roos said that
Wittman's reputation for ability
among the citizens of the city wu of
the best.
Hart H. North, United States Com
missioner of Immigration, said that
the reputation of the members of the
Chinese Educational Society was bad
and that they were, for the most part,
considered highbinders. Thomas Gub
bins gave the society the same reputa
tion and said it had a poor standing
among the better class of merchants.
Dr. Gardner then interpreted Witt
man's proclamation to the Chinese re
garding gambling, telling them that
any one who collected blood money
and promised police protection was an
impostor.
Detective Edward L*. Gibson saw
gambling only once, but knew that it
was going on in the district. He ad
mitted that it was suppressed at pres
ent, but said it would take a large
squad to stamp it out entirely. Ser
geant Christiansen said that twenty
five men could keep the ground floor
âº clubs closed, but to prevent the Chi
nese from gambling In places of se
clusion at least 100 men would be re
quired. Corporal William M. Ross,
who is in the section now. said that
the Chinese fear Cook and that they
attempt to gamble Just as soon as the
sergeant departs for his home. Ross
also testified to having raided a game
of fan-tan in the rooms of the Chinese
Educational Society on February 8.
Sergeant Cook said it would require
at least eighteen men to stop gambling
on the first floors where it was known
to exist and many more if an attempt
was made to stamp it from the dis
trict. Before an adjournment wa?
taken until this evening Attorney
Kahn announced that the defense
would require two more sessions to
complete its testimony.

BIG COASTERS TOSSED
ABOUT BY ANGRY SEAS
A number of coasters arrived yester
day from northern ports and each
brought a tale of the fierce southeast
erly winds which on Sunday had made
progress in a southerly direction al
most an impossibility. The gale had
blown itself out by yesterday morning,
but had left in its trail along the coast
a nasty sea and all day long the bar
was covered with breakers, which
warned the mariner to keep away or
look out for trouble. The Golden Gate
was used only by those vessels whose
business was too urgent to wait for
the bar to settle down.
Some anxiety was felt during the
early part of the day for the coasters
Eureka and Arctic, both from Eureka
and both overdue. Before sunset, how
ever, both were accounted for. The
Eureka came in about 3 o'clock and
the Arctic Just about dark.
They were both twenty-four hours
late. Captain Jessen of the Eureka
said that the wind blew with great
velocity, but that his boat weathered
the gale without any distress except
to the passengers, who were too sick
to care whether the big seas which
slapped the Eureka's bows did any
damage or not.
"They were like the man in the an
cient ocean joke, " said Captain Jes
sen. "When we first bucked into it
they were afraid the ship would sink.
After the seasickness developed they
were afraid it wouldn't."
The Eureka's passengers speak in
awed whispers of their experience.
They declare that the Eureka was
fathoms under the water for long
spells and that at other times the
waves sent her flying through the air
like a wireless telegTam. She threw
summersaults, they say, she wallowed
on her beam ends, she balanced her
self on the extreme tip of her bow and
occasionally for brief spells she rested
on the water, right side ur>. The wind,
they think, blew 1,000,000 miles an hour,
and the waves they describe as ani
mated mountains. They know nothing
of the cooking.
The M. F. Plant, which arrived yes
terday from Coos Bay, was sixty-four
hours making the run. The Whlttier
was fifty-four hours coming from the
Columbia River.
The Pomona should have arrived
yesterday from Eureka, but did not
put in an appearance. It is probable
that she did not leave the northern
port on time, but as the telegraph
wires were out of commission â¢ there
was no way of telling. The Pacific
Coast Steamship Company officials are
not worrying about her.
STORM WAS EXPECTED.
Warnings of Foul Weather Distributed
by Bureau.
Professor McAdie of the Weather
P.ureau says that while the storm is of
seme size and severity it was not al
together unusual or unexpected.
Warnings of the approach of foul
weather were distributed broadcast
fi rty-eight hours before the wind be
gan to blow strongly. The maximum
velocity of the wind in San Francisco
Sunday was thirty-eight miles, while
thf- record is sixty-six miles.
The features of yesterday's continu
ation of the 3torm were the thunder at
Red Bluff and Los Angeles and the
heavy rainfall in the south. The
winds died out late Sunday night and
only breezes were blowing yesterday,
according to the Weather Bureau. The
â¢wind velocity last evening was eight
miles an hour. The storm center
drifted off in a northerly direction last
night and clearing weather is predicted
for to-day.
The rain did much good, particular
ly in the south. The desert received
a generous supply of moisture and last
night rain waÂ» falling as far east as
Phoenix. A heavy snowfall was re
ported from the mountain regions and
the usual water supply for the sum
mer is now in reserve in consequence.

MUST SEAT ONE
OR THE OTHER
Colorado Legislature 3lay
Not Declare Against Both
Alva Adams and Peabody
SUPREME COURT RULES
Keport Which Would Give
Place to the Lieutenant
Governor Will Not Stand
DENVER, March 13.â The Colo
rado Supreme Court at a late hour
this afternoon ruled that the joint
convention of the Legislature cannot
adopt the report of Senator Alexander
on the gubernatorial contest commit
tee, declaring that neither Governor
Adams nor former Governor Peabody
was elected Governor at the Novem
ber election. It is the decision of the
Supreme Court that the Assembly
must decide the contest between the
(.ontestor and contestee and cannot
consider seating Lieutenant Governor
as Governor.
Th-j ciinion was a majority report.
Justice Kc-oert W. Steele holding Â»hat
the Assembly should itself rul? upon
the motion to adopt the Alexar.d^r re-
ICTI.
Nineteen of the twenty-two Repub
lican members of the Legislature who
favored seating Lieutenant Governor
McDonald as Governor and thus dis
posing of the contest over the seat be
tween Alva Adams < Democrat) and
JamFS H. Peabody (Republican) met
in caucus to-night and renewed the
pledge to ctand together in votlne on
the reports from the contest commit
tee.
From unimpeachable sources it is
learned that the twenty-two members
referred to signed an agreement which
in effect was to work for the seatins:
of McDonald and to prevent, if pos
sible, the seating of Peabody. The
persons who are authority for this
statement also say that these so
called anti-Peabody Republicans will
vote as a unit against every report
from the contest committee, which,
if done, will not only defeat Peabody,
but will allow Governor Adams to re
tain the Governorship he now holds.
After voting down the reports, a mo
tion to adjourn the Joint Assembly sine
die. It is said, will be made and sud
ported by the McDonald men and the
Democrats. The Peabody men %miled
when this plan was unfolded to them
and confidently declared that the agree
ment will be broken at the critical mo
ment and enough and more McDonald
men will swing around to seat their
man.
WASHINGTON TO SUPPLANT
STANFORD IN BOAT RACE
Event Will Take Place on Estuary, to
Be Followed by Return Match
In Seattle.
BERKELEY. March 13. â A sensa
tion in University of California ath
letic circles was created to-night by
the announcement that the University
of Washington, through its athletic
manager, rijad an agreement
with Berkeley for an intercollegiate
boat race to take place April 15 on
the estuary, -Washington taking the
place of Stanford University in the
annual event. The reason lies in the
objections . heretofore raised by Stan
ford to racing on the estuary. Evans
has also ' arranged for a return match
with Berkeley to take place at Seattle
between May 18 and June 15.
At this time freshmen crews of the
two universities will also compete.
This agreement is subject to ratifica
tion by the executive committees of
both university student bodies. Evans
and S. S. Hawley, president of the
University of California Boat Club,
will go to Stanford University to
morrow to arrange. if possible, a
three-cornered match race among the

OAKLAND, March 13.â The entire
Republican ticket carried in Oakland
to-day at the municipal election with
one exception. J. E. McKlroy, the
present City Attorney, has defeated
A\<o P. Loach for that office, but by a
very narrow margin, otherwise thn
next city administration will be Reoub
litan in every detail, includine the
eleven Couneilmen, the eleven School
Directors and the entire library board.
Frank K. Mott is elected Mayor by
the largest majority ever given any
Mayor in this city. John L. Davie ran
4, Randolph third and Jack Lon
don last, but Mott will have as many
votes as all the others combined, and
a < l'-ar majority of the vote cast. His
majority will he over 2000 and may
reach 3000 â something unheard of in
Oakland politics, and a testimony to
the higrh regard in which he is held by
the people of Oakland. The hardest
fight in the city, and, as it developed
when the votes were counted, the only
fight, was that for the office of City
Attorney. The one or two expected
vi >t<i lights and the City Treasurer
fight did not materialize â the Repub
lican nominees walking away from
tht-ir opponents. But upon the City
Attorneyship was centered everything.
At midnight, with about two-thirds
of the vote counted. McElroy was 314
votes ahead. He has been ahead durine
the entire count, and his election is
practically assured.
REPUBLICANS FOR MELROY.
The light was a clean one between
the two and McElroy was voted for by
many Republicans upon the ground
that he made such a good record dur
ing his last term. The fight ihut was
expected for City Treasurer did
not show up, for Charles D. Bates Jr.
was given as many votes as his two
opponents put together.
There was some attempt made to
re-elect Dr. Myra Knox School Direc
tor at large as against C. L. Ingler, but
it in almost certain that Ingler will
win, though he was scratched to
some extent.
Most of the Republican ward nomi
nees walked in. Elliott in the Second

defeated Z. T. Hatch In the First Ward
without a great deal of trouble.
E. C. Hahn won in the Fourth Ward
in a three-cornered fight, and W. A.
Donaldson defeated J. T. Wallace, the
Municipal League nominee in ' the
th Ward, though the vote was
closer than some of Donaldson's
friends like. The election was quiet,
and during the morning the vote was
very small. The clear weather of the
afternoon drew out quite a large vote
and the total who registered their
opinions at the polls amounted to
11.552.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1905
PLACES KINIRY
IN BAD PLIGHT
His Damaging Admissions
to the Police Are Told to
Jury by Chief Hodgkins
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 13.
In the trial of David Kiniry, which
was continued this morning, Chief of
Police Hodgkins was on the stand the
entire day and was allowed to tell to
the jury all of the damaging admis
sions made by the young crook on the
way from Los Angeles to this city.
With the exception of some corrobora
tive testimony, the big part of the case
for the people has been put in and
proves from the prisoner's own lips
that he and Goldstein were partners in
crime, and that upon the night of No
vember 27, 1903, they went out for the
purpose of robbing a house, and while
waiting for the inmates to go down to
dinner met Policeman Smith, whom
they killed.
From the questions on cross-exam
ination put by Attorney Frick to the
witness it will evidently be his en
deavor to show that the robbery had
not yet been commenced and does not
therefore place bis client in the class
of those who kill while in the act of
committing a felony. He also has Kin
iry's denial to Chief Hodgkins of his
having fired any shots on the night in
question.
Considerable time was spent in hav
ing Hodgkins tell just how Kiniry told
him he exchanged pistols with his
wounded companion as they ran awajr
from the scene of the murder.

Policeman Finds a Burglar
With "Swag" on Him, but
Is Routed by the Cook
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, March 13.
Deputy Marshal J. Bowers of South
Berkeley caught a thief last night in
the act of walking off with a sack full
of "swag," but instead of capturing
the burglar and the booty, the police
officer was forced to "walk turkey,"
at the bidding of the crook, who used
a revolver to enforce his commands on
Bowers.
Bowers found a stranger walking
through South Berkeley shortly after
midnight with a big sack full of stuff
slung over his back. "Guess that's
a burglar with some of his loot," said
Bowers to himself, "and here is where
I stop one Dick Turpin's . career of
crime."
Then the Dolice officer yelled: "Halt!
I want to examine that sack of yours!"
When Bowers turned hts bullseye
lantern on the sack, however, he looked
first into the muzzle of a big revolver,
which the man with the sack thrust
into his face.
"Now you turn around and walk till
I tell you to stop," said the man with
sack, "and don't make any mistake
about stopping!"
Bowers obeyed. He walked a bipek
or two and then ventured to peek
around to see if his quarry was still
in the rear. He was.
"If you look around again it will
mean a bullet in your hide," cried the
pursuer, and thereafter for a distance
of half a mile Bowers walked stead
ily without once peeking back to see
what might be in the rear.
The burglar made his escape. Bow
ers awakened Deputy Marshal Pickett
and the two men discovered that Tayn
ton's cigar store on Shattuck avenue
had been broken open and about $50
worth of goods stolen. It Is supposed

the lsbt island mail. Miss LÂ»ewthwaite has
been teaching at Wailuka, Mauii, for the last
year, and Just as her Oakland friends were
beginning to expect an early visit from her
comes worrt that she has decided to establish
her lares and penates under a bamboo tree
permanently. The wediing is to be an April
eretlt, and in thp meantime the happy couple
are busy superintending: the building pf a
home at Puunene. where Mr. Keeney Is sta

sugar firm oi Alexander & Baldwin, and oc
cupies a very responsible and lucrative position.
Mr. Keeney has cent to California for the house
furnishings, and the plans call for complete
and perfect appointments throughout the llttlf

Miss Lewthwaite Is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Alexander Lewthwaite of Fruitvale, and
closely related to the L,. A. Stephensons. She
is a very attractive and lovable girl, and is a
l lanist of more than ordinary ability.
The band of intellectual workers who have
enjoyed a happy fellowship for several months,
under the appellation of the Palette. Lyrr and
Pen Club, held pleasant communion Friday
evening last &\ the club rooms in Maple Hall.
The iirogxamnus are unique always, because
originality in art literature and music is en
couraged and a high standard must always
by maintained.
La*t Friday evening that clever editorial
writer and popular clubman, Joseph E. Baker,
and his bright little wife, planned the hour's
entertainment. Mr. Baker himself read a
charming bit of original verse on "Spring." A
humorous story by Charles W'oodbury was read
by that gentleman and Mra. W. E. Rollins, in
the absence of her artist husband, read a very
Interesting paper, written purposely for this
meeting of the club and descriptive of the
Moki Indians. Mr. Rollins has been In Ari
zona for several months and will bring back
many studies of these quaint people.
The saxophone solos by W. J. McCoy were
delightful surprises to most of his listeners,
for, though we know Mr. McCoy to be a thor
(Ugh musician, his accomplishment in that line
was unsuspected.
Some of the leading members of the P. Tj.
P. Club are W. J. McCoy, J. E. Baker, Mrs.
Baker. Jack London, C. P. NellÃon. Mrs. Ma

Next Friday night C. P. Neilson will give
an exhibit of water colors and a "Talk on
Art"' that promises to be full of Interest, as
Mr. Neileon Is not only one of the prominent
artists of the State, but is a very entertain
ing talker as well.
Wednesday will be a busy day for the smart
set. The. Oakland Club luncheon, which is
always an important function, takes place
this coming Wednesday. On the same day
Mies Florinne Brown will entertain in honor
of Miss Marion Smith, the fiancee of her
nephew, Roland Oliver. Mrs. Alexander Marx
and Mrs. Oliver Ellsworth will also hostess
luncheon parties, and an informal musicale
will be given at the home of Mrs. Edward C.
Fer.nessey.
Besides the Brown luncheon a number of
other email affairs are being planned for Miss
Smith, among those who are contemplating
some such compliment being Mrs. John J. Val
entine.
The muscial programme that will follow the
Ebell luncheon to-morrow is under the super
vision of Mrs. J. Hamilton Todd and is full
of promise. Mrs. Olive Reed Cushman, the
contralto, will sing, and as this is the first
time Mrs. Oushman has sung in public since
her return from New York her appearance
will be hailed with delight, as she Is a great
favorite, here.
Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Gaston of Phila

BIG "C NOT
TO HIS TASTE
College Professor Begs Boys
to Refrain From Desecrat
ing Charter Hill Front
LETTER FROM WHITNEY
University Instructor Makes
Impassioned Appeal to the
Students Regarding Matter
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, March 13.
College boys who dreamed of plant
ing a gigantic golden "C" on Charter
hill, beneath which should be engraved
the numerals of the freshman class,
the entire ceremony to be a Charter
day affair and the beginning of a no
table college tradition, have awakened
from their dream with a rude shock,
for which Professor A. W. Whitney of
the mathematics department is re
sponsible.
Professor Whitney has addressed an
open letter to the sophomore and fresh
man classes, which are principally con
cerned in the plan to build the big
"C," beseeeffing them to reconsider
their resolve, declaring that if the plan
is carried out, the famous hill will be
desecrated, the university will be made
ridiculous, San Francisco's interests in
the Berkeley hills will be violated, the
Orient will be shocked, and altogether a
long train of ills engendered.
The college youths awoke this morn
ing to be greeted by the following com
munication addressed to them by Pro
fessor Whitnev, the exact purpose of
which they are still studying to under
stand:
While in reality the land upon which It Is
proposed to build the cement "C" is a part
of the university campus, in a far larger sense
It an 1 all the hills about'the bay are the com
moo heritage of the people of California. It is
our birthright to look upon them, to watch
their iia.->ins: shadow's, to note their response
to the fall showers and to follow their gradual
changes from delicate green through the lux
uriant c^lor of spring into the russet hue of
summer â that Is one of the privileges of be â 
Ing a Caltfornlan; to desecrate tnlÃ scene by
a symbol, perfectly worthy in itself and in an
other place, but entirely uneuited to th*> g^n
tl-e beauty of the hills, Is a blow to the moral
rights at the people of "'alifornia.
'I be "gotlsm of a college community is for
the most part pardonableâ it Is Interesting and
the world lroks at it in an indulgent wny â
but let us for that very reason have a ears
rot to carry It too far. Here is a college com
munity of pprhaps three thousand persons
wnone fervid zeal for their university may
blind thejr native sense of the fitness of things
Eojthat. to â  them a cement "C" on the hills,
pajrtlod.jfpllpw once a year, is a worthy symbol
of their alma mater. On the other hand, here
â 'rtirpunlty of a hundred thousand people
RrtfvHi 'Â»Â»Fy Bight nf the hills to whom this
deaaoTation of nature la an affront, and not
fT, r* iUÂ»K but for twenty years of days.
Of all tho institutions in the world a uni
versity should stand only for what is best,
for the drift idoal citizenship and conduct. I>>t
three thousand young pecpie for four years
live in the contemplation of this kind of vul
garity and the State need not be surprised to
find <hem painting "Cs" upon El Capitan.
Anfl^Wfly Â«<*t? Why is it -worse? The Berke
ley hills in their way are Just as fine as the
ToMÃdte; they front the Orient; a thousand
times as many people look upon them; our
wantonness would be In the eyes of the- world.
We cannot afford to stand for such vulgar
ity and Philistinism. The country laughed at
cur rtrslre to illuminate the Tosemlte for Pres
ident Roosevelt; let us not give It another
chance.
Surely aur students hava enough pride, rev
erence and manhood to give up rushing volun
tarily, rather than barter their supposed priv
ilege for the right to perpetrate a lasting in
dignity upon themselves, their alma mater, the
community and the State. Yours sincerely,
A. W. WHITNEY.
Divers wise youths of the university
declared their belief that Professor
Whitney was "guying" them, and was
not actually serious, but the pseudo
wisdom of this section of college life
was revealed when Professor Charles
Mills Gayley astonished the student
body by coming out with a letter,
backing up Whitney's proposal, and
adding to its force. Professor Gayley
wrote to the college men thus:
I have read Professor Whitney's letter with
deep interest; and. while I respect the motive
with which our freshmen and sophomore? have
entered upon this substitute for Charter day
rush. I Join him in begging them to consider
whether some better way of "burying the
hatchet" may not be devised. I concur in his
appreh-nsion lest in our zeal to commemorate
the era of good will we may set up a monu
ment which shall disfigure our hills and ba a
source of mortification to us.
Can wo not devise some other memorial?
How would a great "C" of acacia trees do, or
of that golden broom that bursts Into blossom
early in March? or something else; anything
else, for that matter, that has been more
carefully considered by the whole body of the
university. Yours sincerely.
C. M. OAYLEY.
All preparations have been made by
the sophomores and freshmen to build
the big "C" next Saturday. The men
are to be excused from all university
exercises, and the women students will
provide them with luncheon. The cost
cf the wcrk, including expenses of ma
terials and other incidentals, is to be
defrayed by the classmen, on whom an
assessment has been levied.
The plan was approved at separate
meetings of the freshmen and sopho
more classes, when it was voted to
abandon the practice of "rushing" on
dinner day, and substitute for that
unhallowed but exciting sport the
more prosaic stunt of building a great
golden "C" on Charter hill, and plant
ing freshman class numerals beneath.
It is said by the college youths that
Professors Gayley and Whitney have
spoken too late in the matter, and that
the plans will not now be changed be
cause of the faculty members' appeal
to the artistic instincts of the varsity
men.

of grand larceny, in having taken
rings and $108 from aged Emily
Tyson of Niles, was begun this morn
ing before Judge Henry Melvin. He
was convicted last Thursday of petty
larceny for having taken two of the
old lady's rings, and now must stand
trial for taking the money.
One of the hopes of Proctor's coun
sel was blasted in the course of the
trial to-day, when he made a motion
to have his client dismissed on the
ground that he should have been
charged with embezzlement instead of
grand larceny. Judge Melvin, how
ever, refused to take this view of the
matter.
Schaffer Gets Franchise.
OAKLAND, March 13. â Mayor
Warren Olney to-day signed an or
dinance granting Louis Schaffer, a
former City Councilman, a twenty
years' exclusive privilege to remove
dead animals. The Mayor approved
the ordinance on the opinion of City
Attorney McElroy that a former
Council's action in passing the ordi
nance bound the city when Schaffer
had paid money on a bid for the fran
chise.

Police Help Invoked by Hus
band Who Claims Kin With
Inventor of Holland Boat
LOSES HIS FORTUNE
Complaining Spouso Mia
Detective Story of Alleged
Theft of Much Collateral
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 13.
Charging that his wife, Delia Hol
land, has eloped and taken with her
$22,000 worth of Holland Submarine
Boat bonds, John T. Holland, who
says he is a brother of the boat's in
ventor, requested help from the Oak
land police department to-day to find
his alleged missing spouse and the col
lateral. The accusing husband de
clared his wife ran away last Thurs
day with a cook named Davis, who had
been working at Point Richmond. Hol
land asserted he had traced the pair
to Oakland and here lost their trail.
The bonds alleged to have been
stolen, Holland asserts, were issued by
the Electric Boat Company of 100
Broadway, N. T. He told Detective
Quigley that he had acquired them
for services rendered his brother in
constructing and developing the Hol
land submarines. He had given them
to Mrs. Holland to take care of as a
nest egg in his old age.
According to his complaint Holland
wedded his present wife three years
ago, the venture being his second trial
in the matrimonial market. This help
meet is many years his junior and, said
the husband, was not in entire sym
pathy with him. Holland is in the
neighborhood of 60 years, while Mrs.
Holland has barely passed the mean
of 35 years. The police accepted th'?
complaint for what it was worth. They
had no opportunity to verify the
charges. Holland said he resides at
153 Minna street. San Francisco. He
intends to swear out a warrant in San
Francisco for his wife's arrest.

Government 3lay Have to
Stop Work on the Vessel
Intrepid at Mare Island
WASHINGTON, March 13â Owing to
the failure of Congress at the session
just closed to grant the request of the
Xavy Department for an appropria
tion of a small sum of money to com
plete the two training ships now un
der construction at Boston and Mare
Island navy yards, the department
has been obliged to stop work entirely
on the Cumberland at the Boston Yard
and to consider the necessity of taking
similar action in the case of the In
trepid at the Mare Island j'ard.
The approprition for these ships was
$320,000 in each case, but it became ap
parent during the past winter that
more money would be required because
<f a generally greater cost of material
and work. Therefore a deficiency esti
mate was submitted, which Congress
probably by an oversight neglected to
grant.
The vessels are said to be needed
badly for the training of midshipmen
and apprentices.
DESERTION LEADING GROUND
OF YESTERDAY'S DIVORCES
Hearings in Different Courts Give
Such Cause as Basis of
Action.
After an argument that lasted all
day in the case of Ada R. Duncan,
who is suing Benjamin B. Duncan for
divorce and alimony, Judge Seawell
took the matter under advisement yes
terday. Mrs. Duncan alleges cruelty
and desertion and brought into the
case to support her contention the
testimony of her two children. A short
time ago Judge Seawell granted' the
plaintiff $250 counsel fees, $120 a
month alimony and $300 back ali
mony, pending the suit. No portion
of these amounts has been paid.
Judge Hebbard granted a divorce
to Mary D. Newton from William H.
Xewton on the ground of desertion;
Judge Graham awarded freedom to
Anna S. Joyce from George Joyce,
and Judge Kerrigan to Clara Ellis
from William Ellis, and to George
Ebe from Lottie Ebe for the same
cause.
The following actions were filed
yesterday: Minnie Plath against Ed

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1905.
ANOTHER NAME
GIVEN POLICE
Detectives Are Seeking Max
Magner, Butler, Formerly
in Mrs. Stanford's Home
MAY HAVE INFOBMATION
President Jordan Declares
That No Suspicion Should
Rest on Bertha Berner
Max Jlagner is the latest individual
to attract the attention of the local po
lice in connection with the mysterious
death of Mrs. Stanford, and if the hopes
of Captain of Detectives Burnett are
realized the much-wanted man will be
brought into the presence of the head
of the local detective force to-day or
to-morrow and asked to tell all he
knows about the Stanford household
during the several months prior to
January 14, the date on which it Is
supposed that an attempt was made to
poison the mistress of the California
greet mansion.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
Police Department, co-operating with
Morse's detective agency, has been
carefully sifting every phase of life in
the Stanford household for a period of
six months, in its energetic effort to
find the necessary clew to the identity
of the person guilty of administering
poison to Mrs. Stanford, and has been
bringing into prominence those who
were close to the philanthropic woman,
Max Magner has, until lately,
strangely escaped notice. Now he is
badly wanted by Captain Burnett, who
is on the trail of the fellow and ex
pects to reach him within the next
forty-eight hours. Magner was, for a
number of months, Mrs. Stanford's
butler, a fact that the police were late
in learning. Contrary' to the general
understanding, it was Magner and not
McWhinney who succeeded Butler
Beverly last May, and he remained in
his position until a short time before
Mrs. Stanford was taken ill at the Cal
ifornia-street house, when he was sud
denly dismissed and was succeeded by
McWhinney.
These facts were given to the police
by Miss Richmond, together with other
data that prompted Captain Burnett
to Immediately institute a search for
the former butleV. According to her in
formation, imparted several days ago
to Captain Burnett, Magner was not
long in Mrs. Stanford's employ before
he got into disfavor with his mistress.
The latter's former maid has told the
police that Magner was of an erratic
disposition and the fact soon began to
annoy Mrs. Stanford, who finally, while
on her way to New York, left Magner
in Chicago. On returning westward,
however, she picked him up in the
Windy City and brought him back to
this city. He went to Southern Cali
fornia for a. while and then returned
to Mrs. Stanford's home, but, failing
to please her, he was dismissed. It
was then that Caterer Ludwig was
appealed to by Mrs. Stanford to hur
riedly furnish her with a butler and
McWhinney was sent to the Califor
nia-street mansion. Just what infor
mation the detectives expect to get
from Magner is only a matter of spec
ulation, for there is not the slightest
hint that he is in any way under sus
picion. It is possible, however, he may
be able to shed further light on the
servants' wranglings that constantly
disturbed the peace of the Stanford
household.
Yesterday Captain Burnett and his
detectives, while impatiently waiting
for some definite information from
Honolulu, busied themselves for two
hours subjecting Ng Yeng, Mrs. Stan
ford's cook, to a severe questioning.
The trend of the Chinaman's examina
tion was along lines bearing on the
disputed question as to who served
Mrs. Stanford with Poland water on
January 13. Miss Richmond has sev
eral times said that the water was
taken to Mrs. Stanford's room and
opened by Butler McWhinney, and the
latter has vehemently denied the ac
cusation. Ah Wing's memory is fail
ing on this important question, and
Yeng now professes his inability to re
call who served the water, although in
a previous examination he showed
more willingness to favor the police
with minute details of servant life in
the Stanford house on January 13.
ABSOLVES MISS BERXER.
President Jordan Regards Former
Secretary as Innocent.
HONOLULU, March 13.â David Starr
Jordan, president of the Stanford Uni
versity, to-day expressed his confidence
in the innocence of Miss Berner in
connection with the death of Mrs.
Jane L. Stanford. He said he believed
her statements to High Sheriff Henry,
and declared that the Coroner's jury
wanted to state in the verdict that Miss
Berner was exonerated from suspicion,
but the Jurors were prevented from
taking: such action on the ground that
it was not the proper time for the ex
pression of such opinion.
In the absence of further discoveries,
the case of the death of Mrs. Jane
Lathrop Stanford at the Moano Hotel
here on February 28 is resolving itself
into a scientific controversy between
chemists as well as between physicians.
Some prominent physicians here, who
do not desire to be quoted, are against
the poisoning theory and believe that
Mrs. Stanford died from natural
causes. On the other hand the autopsy
physicians and Dr. F. Humphris, who
attended Mrs. Stanford on the night of
her death, as well as other doctors
who have been prominent here for
many years, are absolutely positive
that d?ath was caused by strychnine
poisoning.
R. A- Duncan, Food Commissioner
and Chemical Analyst of the Board of
Health, and Edmund Shorey, chemist
of tho United States Agricultural Sta
tion, formerly chemist of the Board of
Health, who made the chemical tests,
have prepared a statement of their ex
periments, and the physicians have
prepared a detailed account of the
autopsy. *
The Advertiser will to-morrow print
an interview with Dr. Wood, who per
formed the autopsy on the body of
Mrs. Stanford. He says that the pres
ence of strychnine in the bottle of bi
carbonate of soda refutes all of the
theories of natural death. The strych
nine was a foreign substance there and
it did not belong to the preparation of
bicarbonate. Dr. Wood declares that
the poison was thoroughly mixed with
the bicarbonate of soda by some one
who was very familiar with the
strength and effect of strychnine, but
he does not say that the strychnine
was placed in the bottle with murder
ous intent. Regarding the efforts to
account for symptoms on the theory of
natural death he said that he can make
the ante-mortem symptoms, or post
mortem signs, apply to prove that
death was due to a number of causes.
Council to Attend Funeral.
SAN JOSE, March 13.â The City
Council this afternoon adopted the fol
lowing memorial resolution in respect
DUTY OF THE MOTHER
THEME OF PRESIDENT
Mr. Roosevelt Argues That Fate of Nation
Depends Upon Home and Family.
WASHINGTON, March 13. â An ad
dress by President Roosevelt was the
feature of the evening session of the
National Congress of Mothers, now
holding its triennial convention at the
Metropolitan Methodist Episcopal
Ciiurch. There was an immense crowd
at the church, composed largely of
vomen, and when Mr. Roosevelt, ac
companied by Secretary Loeb, arrived
he was given a cordial reception.
He read his speech, but now and
then interjected some extemporaneous
remarks when he wished to emphasiz
a point. The President spoke in part
as follows:
In our modern industrial civilization there
are many and grave dangers to counterbalance
the splendors and the triumphs. It is not a
good thing to see cities grow at dispropor
tionate speed relatively to the country; for
the small land owners, the men who own their
little homes, and therefore to a very large
extent the mÂ«n who till farm*, the men of
the soil, have hitherto made the foundation of
lasting- national life in every gtate; and. If
the foundation becomes either too weak or
too narrow, the superstructure, no matter how
attractive, is in Imminent danger of falling.
But far more important than the question
of the occupation of our citizens is the ques
tion of how their family life is conducted. No
matter what that occupation may be, as long
as there is a real home and as long as those
who make up that home do their duty to one
another, to their neighbors and to the state,
it Is of minor consequence whether the man's
trade is plied in the country or the city,
whether it calls for the work of the hands
or for the work of the head.
But the nation Is in a bad way if there
is no real home, If the family Is not of the
right kind: if the man is not a good hus
band and father, if he Is brutal or cow
ardly or selfish; if the woman has lost her
sense of duty, if she is sunk in vapid self
indulgence or has let her nature be twisted
so that she prefers a sterile pseudo-intellect
uality to that great and beautiful development
of character which comes only to those whose
lives know the fullness of duty done, of effort
made and self-sacrifice undergone.
STATE DEPENDS ON FAMILY.
In the last analysis the welfare of the state
depends absolutely upon whether or not the
average family, the average man and woman
and their children represent the kind of citi
zenship fit for the foundation of a great
nation: and if we fall to appreciate this we
fall to aiipre<;iate the root morality upon
which all healthy civilization Is based.
No piled up wealth, no splendor or material
growth, no brilliance of artistic development,
will permanently avail any people unless Its
home life ie healthy, unless the average man
paâtfâa honesty, courage, common sense and
dt-ceney, unlos-p he works hard and is willing
at need to flght hard, and unless the average
woman is a good wife, a good mother, able and
willing to perform the first and greatest duty
of womanhood, able and willing to bear and
to bring up as they should be brought up
healthy children, sound in body, mind and
character, and numerous enough so that the
race shall increase and not decrease.
The woman should have ample educational
advantages; but tave in exceptional cases the
man must be. and she need not be, and gen
erally ought not to be, trained for a life
long career as the family breadwinner; and,
therefore, after a certain point the training
of the two must normally be different because
the duties ot' the two are normally different.
MOTHERS' GRAVE DUTIES.
InHsmuch as I am speaking to an assemblage
of mothers I shall have nothing whatever to
say in praiso of an easy life. Yours is the
work which is never ended. No mother has
an easy time, and most mothers have very
hard times; and y*t what true mother would
barter her experience of Joy and sorrow in
exenange lor a life of cold oelrtshness, which
insists upon perpetual amusement and the
avoidance of care, and which often finds its
fit dwelling place in some flat designed to
furnish with the least possible expenditure of
effort the maximum of comfort and ot" luxury,
but in which there Is literally no place for
children ?
I do not in the least believe In the patient
Grlscldi. type of woman, in the woman who
submits to gross and long continued ill treat
ment, any more than I believe In a man who
tamely submits to wrongful _ aggression. I
regard marriage as a partnership, in which
each partner is in honor bound to think of the
rights of the other as well as of his or her
own. But I think that the duties are even
more important than the rights; and In the
long run I think that the reward is ampler
and greater for duty well done than for the in
sistence upon individual rights. necessary
though this, too, must often be. Your duty
is hard, your responsibility great: but greatest
of all is your reward. I do not pity you in
the least. On the contrary, I feel respect and
admiration for ycu.
Into the woman's keeping is committed the
destiny of the generations to come after us.
In bringing up your children you mothers must
remember that while It is essential to be
loving and tender it Is no less essential to be
wise and firm. If you mothers through weak
ness bring up your sons to be selfish and to
think only of themselves, you will be re
sponsible for much sadness among the women
who are to be their wives in the future. If
you let your daughters grow up idle, perhaps
under the mistaken impression that as you
yourselves have had to work hard they shall
know only enjoyment, you are preparing them
to be useless to others and burdens to them
selves. Teach boys and girls alike that they
are not to look forward to lives spent in
avoiding difficulties but to lives spent in over
comlnz them.
DANGERS FROM DIVORCE.
There are mary good people who are denied
the supreme blessing of children, and for these
we havo the respect and sympathy always due
to those who, from no fault of their own, are
denied any of the other great blessings of life.
But th<! man or woman who deliberately fore
goes these blessings, whether from victouc
ness, coldness, shallow-heartedness, self-in
dulgence, or mere failure to appreciate aright
the difference between the all-important and
the unimportantâ why, such a creature merits
contempt as hearty as any visited upon the
soldier who runs away In battle, or upon the
man who refuses to work for the support of
tho3Â« dependent upon him, and who, though
able-bodied, is yet content to eat In Idleness
th* bread which others provide.
The existence of women of this type forms
one of the most unpleasant and unwholesomo
features of modern life. If any are so dim
of vision as to fall to see what a thoroughly
unlovely creature such a woman Is, I wish
they would read Judge Robert Grant's novel,
"Unleavened Bread." ponder seriously the
character of Selma, and think of the fate that
would surely overcome any nation which de
veloped Us average and typical woman along
to the late Mrs. Jane L. Stanford:
"That in the death of this great and
good pioneer woman the county of
Santa Clara has lost its most illustri
ous citizen, education its greatest pa
tron, the cause of worthy charity its
most liberal benefactress and the State
of California its most noted philan
thropist."
"In respect to her memory and in ap
preciation of her noble deeds and bene
factions" the flag was ordered display
ed at half-mast on the City Hall until
after the funeral of Mrs. Stanford, and
the Mayor and Common Council will
attend the funeral service at Palo Alto
in a body. The resolutions also request
that the various boards and depart
ments of the city be represented at the
obsequies. Copies of the resolutions are
to be sent to Charles G. Lathrop and
the Stanford University trustees.
Board Passes Resolutions.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted the following resolutions of
respect to the memory of the late Mrs.
Jane Lathrop Stanford:
Whereas. Jane Lathrop Stanford, a public
spirited woman of excelling benevolence and
great personal worth, has died in distant Isles
of the sea far from home and kin; and
Whereas. California, bountiful in all things.

of the splendid woman who so unselfishly ad
vanced the cause of education; therefore be It
Resolved That we, the legislative body of
the metropolis of this State, acting in our
representative capacity, hereby publicly ex
press the universal sorrow for Mrs. Stanford's
death and the deep appreciation of her lib
erality to this commonwealth; tnd be It further
Resolved That we extend the sympathies of
the people to the mourning relatives, and that
these resolutions be spread at length In our

such lines. Unfortunately it would be untrue
to say that this ;ype exists only in American
ttOVfite That it also exists In American life 1=
made unpleasantly evident by the statistics
as to the dwindling families in some localities.
It is made evident in equally sinister fash
ion by the census statistics as to divorce,
which are fairly appalling; for easy divorce
i.< now, as it ever has been, a. bane to any na
tion, a curse to society, a menace to the home,
an incitement to married unhapplness and to
immorality, an evil thing for men and a still
more hideous evil for women. These unpleas
ant tendencies In our American life are made
evident by articles such as those which I act
ually read not lonp: ago in a. certain paper,
where a clergyman waa quoted, seemingly with
approval, as expressing- the general American
attitude when he said that the ambition of any
save a very rich man should be to rear two
children only, co as to give his children an
opportunity "to taste a, few of the good things
of life."
WOMAN'S TRUE REWARD.
This man, whose profession and calling
should have made him a moral teacher, act
ually set before ethers the ideal, not of train -
Ins children to do their duty, not of sending
then forth with stout hearts and ready minds
to win triumphs for themselves and their
country, not of allowing them the opportunity
and giving them the privilege of making their
own place in the world, but, forsooth, of keep
ing the number of children so limited that
they might "taste a few good things!"
A race that practiced such doctrine â that Is,
a race that practiced race suicide â would
thereby conclusively show that It was unfit to
exist, and that It had better give place to
poeople who had not forgotten the primary
laws of their being.
The woman's task Is not easy â no task
worth doing is easy â but in doing It, and
when Fhe has done it. there shall come to her
the highest and holiest joy known to mankind;
and having done it, ahe shall have the reward
prophesied In Scripture; for her husband and
her children, yes, and all people who realize
that her work lies at the foundation of all na
tional happiness and greatness, shall rise up
and call her blessed.
At one portion of his speech, Pres
ident Roosevelt, departing from his
text, said: "I can say with entire
sincerity that nobody I have ever ad
dressed since I have been President
appeals to me so much as this body,
and in this I express the sense of the
entire White House." Hearty ap
plause greeted this remark.
At another time, when there was a
manifestation of approval of his ob
servations touching the aggressiveness
of boys, the President with evident
pleasure said: "You mothers seem to
have the heroic spirit."
Later on, when referring to his
trips about the country, the President
said in effect: "No one sight brings
out so much of my respect as a
mother who has come outside of her
house and brought her children with
her because she could not leave them
at home."

MOOSE CARRIES
OFF A HUNTER
Wounded Animal Surprises
Sportsman and Gives Him
Ride Down a 3lountainside
&CÂ«clal Dispatch to The C*lL
TACOMA, March 13.â Near Dawson
three weeks ago Thomas Howrie rode
down the side of a mountain on the
horns of a wounded moose. Several
hundred yards he traveled this way
and then the moose threw him thirty
feet and dropped dead. Howrie es
caped without a scratch.
Howrie had shot a fine moose at a
hundred yards. The animal dropped
and, believing it dead, the Dawson man
approached. He laid aside his gun and
was reaching for his hunting knife
when the animal raised itself and man
aged to get its horns under Howrie.
Then in a flash the moose raised it
self to its feet and went down the
mountainside, Howrie hanging help
lessly to its horns. For probably 400
yards the animal tore along. Finally it
stumbled, and with one tremendous
toss, threw Howrie into a snowbank,
falling dead immediately after. Its
carcass weighed 650 pounds.

ALBANY. N. V., March 13.â Paper*
were served to-day in New York by a
deputy Sheriff of Saratoga County
upon James H. Hyde and the Equita
ble Life Assurance Society in a suit
brought by Mary S. Young, a resident
of Saratoga, through State Senator
Edgar T. Brackett. Sensational chargea
are made against both the Kquitable
Life and Hyde in the i omplaint.
The purpose of the suit is to restrain
the company from paying Hyde $100,000
as antannual salary, and to compel the
restitution of all the money he haa so
drawn from the funds of the society.
Such a stupendous salary, it is urged.
is wrongful and constitutes a waste of
the funds of the company.
The complaint alleges that it waa
practically through the dummy direc
tors controlled by Hyde that he was
enabled to have such a great salary
awarded to himself. It also makes the
astounding charge that thirty -eight of
the board of fifty-two directors ar
tually dummies, who own not a share
of the capital stock of the society, and
were put in office simply to do the bid
ding of Hyde. The suit will so int-> the
legality of these men serving as direc
tors of the society. The papers also
assert the right of the policy holder*
to participate in the net earnings and
surplus of the society.
Mrs. Young is a policy hplder in the
company for the small sum of $1000,
her policy being in the form of one of

Rivnl High School Players Struggle
Hard to Get Away With
the Game.
The basketball team of LiÂ«?k pulled
out ahfad of the lads from "Poliv in
a Closely rontept^rJ game at the Y. M.
H. A. Uutt evening by a score of 18 to
15. The wearers of the black and
gold held a lead of two iioints up to
the last f>w minutes of the allotted
time. Both teams were playing with
a vengeance when McKenzie of
"Polly" threw a basket tying the score.
The rules governing the game say,
should such a state of affairs occur
th* Jfame shil! < ontinue until either
side has scored two points.
' Under this decision play was re
sumed through a few seconds of
nerve-racking uncertainty,, which was
broken by simultaneous fouling on
both sides. ,
Johns of the winning team was the
most brilliant player, throwing six
baskets; from the : field ,and one free,
netting in all seventeen â , of the eigh
teen -points scored by his team.':
The .Polytecnie points were mad
largely by their captain. McKenzle.
During the; first half the; " Polly" boy*
had numerous chances to better their
score,, but did not ' profit ; as well as
Lick . did with ".; her fewer ; . openings.
.The teams lined up as follows:

Captain Â«. M. Kochersperger of the
United States cavalry stationed at
Camp Wallace In the Philippines,
writes to the police authorities of this
city notifying them that he believes
thitt First Sf-rgeant John Brashland
t.f his troop had been drugged to death
with knockout drops and robb.d of
$I'6oo in this city last December. The
police say that the Captain is mistak
en. The autopsy made m the Morgue
showed that death reunited from al
coholism, and the city toxicologist who
analyzed the contents of the stomach
reported that the man had not been
poisoned. The missing money was in
checks and had been deposited by
Brashland with a saloon man, from
whom he afterward, drew the checks,
giving his receipt therefor.

practice daily. It is expected that a
big crowd will turn out, even though
the hour is a bit early for a baseball
game.

MANAGERS PASS
OUT ELOQUENCE
Nolan and Willie Britt Fig
ure in a Long Drawn Out
Conference Over a Match
BONUS IS THE STICKLER
Nelson Want* to Box Native
Son. but Refuses to Allow
Latter All That He Asks
Now that Jabez White, the much
touted champ from the domain of Ed
ward VII, has consented to be the next
opponent of Jimmy Britt, Mr. Nelson
and his followers are beginning to fa
vor sportdem with some of their elo
quence. The Britts always had the
reputation of being there in a contest
of words, so when Willie Britt and Bil
ly Nolan, Nelson's manager, got to
gether in Harry Corbett's last night the
house fairly reeked with talk.
Nolan cc/mmenced to argue with Wil
lie and as the conversation grew apace
it waxed warmer and warmer till the
electric fans went out of commission.
The pair exchanged compliments, pass
ed out opinions, dwelt on past records,
but wound up without starting a fight.
The whole trouble arose over the de
mand made some time ago by Britt for
a 10 per cent bonus for signing articles
to box Nelson. The Dane expresses his
willingness to meet Britt for 65 per cent
of the gross receipts. But Britt insists
on the little bonus, and as long as he
takes this stand Nelson says he cannot
talk any business with him.
Whether or not White is coming over
here to face the Californian remains to
be seen. Many of the wise ones say
White is content to parade about Lon
don town and read the boosts which
the American papers hand out so often.
It is said on good authority that White
will never come here.
Nelson has little respect for the fight
ing prowess of the Britisher. I will
agree to put him away inside of eight
rounds," said the Dane last night. I
will bet $1000 on this, and if I lose I will
turn the gate receipts over to any char
itable institution in rtie city. Britt
wants to nick up some easy money. I
want to fight him and he wont give me
a chance."
There was a rumor floating around
the town last night that Morris Levy
will Import Jimmy Gardner here to
fight Nelson in April. This fight may
be held under the sanction of the Su
pervisors, wnile Jimmy Coffroth figures
on pulling off the Britt-White go under
the protection of the Mayor.

Dr. J. I. Stephen, chief surgeon of

Pawlirki and Stevens were notified
that they would have to stand an ex

L^st night the doctors affected by the
proposed change waited in a body
upon the chief and expressed their
displeasure at the new order of things.
The meeting was held in the kitch
en and after a long conference Ste
phen wa's forced to agree to stand thÂ«
extra watches. The surgeons object

to the service, inasmuch as the new
watch would compel them to be away

Jeffries and Johnson.
He figures that some club would

this together with the $10,000 would
net Jeffries about $30,000 for one bat

ASK FOR ASSISTANCE
OF THF. SUPREME COURT
siutkiioldcrs of the Navajo Mining
Company Fear They May LÂ«ose
Valuable Option.
Application was made to the Su
(Hfme Court yesterday for a writ com
pelling Charles Curry. Secretary of
Sate. to file and issue the certificates
of increase of stock of the Navajo Min
ing and Development Company of
Redding. The corporation secured an
option on some valuable mineral prop
erty and a stockholders' meeting was
called to consider the consequent ne
cessity of increasing the capital stock.
The vote on the question was unani
mous for the proposed change.
Curry had refused to file
a lid issue the new certificates on the
ground that the requisite notice of
f-ixty days had not been given the
stockholders before the meeting. The
court has granted an alternative writ,
returnable April 3. The mining com
pany says it will lose its option unless
Curry is compelled to do as is wished.

City of Para Due To-Morrow.
It will probably be to-morrow before the
Pacific Mail Company's liner City of Para ar
rives from the isthmus. Meanwhile specula
tion is active as to the reason why Captain
Brown suspended Chief Officer Coshlan from
duty. When the liner left Panama Ooghlan
had been ordered to his room and the third
fleer was performing the chief .officer's du
ties. Brown and trouble with his officers is
an old story in the Pacific Mail service, but
special Interest attaches to this particular
trouble for the reason that Cogrhlan has already
made one trip with Captain Frown and in
making a second established a record that is
said to have few equals. Cogtilan, who Is a
son of Rear Admiral Coghlan. was second of
ficer of the ill-fated Rio de Janeiro when she
went down near the Golden Gate Upon that
occasion Ccehlan acted â¢ with great gallaniry
and was instrumental in saving many lives.
This, in connection with a good, clean record,
will help him in Ms present difficulty, the na

DENVER, March 13.â Police Captain
William Bohanna and Police Surgeon
Frank Duly, who were shot yesterday
by George Schistler when about to ar
rest him after he had killed Mr. and
Mrs. K. Sill, his neighbors, were still
alive to-day and probably will recover.
Captain Bohanna has been a member
of the Denver police force for twenty
four years.
Mrs. Schistler, who suffers from
heart disease, lay unconscious many
hours after hearing of the deed of her
husband, but revived early to-day.
At the autopsies 119 buckshot were
taken from the body of Mrs. Sill and
seventy-nine from her husband's body.
Schistler was killed by a bullet in his
head, but whether it was fired by him

at bay for three hours is not known.
Schistler, who had had a lawsuit with
Sill over a line fence, is believed to
have been temporarily deranged.

SALE AROUSES
PERKINS' ANGER
Condemns Those Who Had
a Hand in Disposal of
Methodist Book Concern
SPEAKS OF BETEAYAL
Eev. Charles Stelzle Tells
Brethren Union Men Are
Doubtful of Politicians
The loss of the premises, 1037 Market
Btreet, on which the Methodist Book
Concern has stood for years, through
its disposal to Louis Friedman by
Eat' - & Main, the New York agents
of the organization, has proved a
thorn in the side of the Methodists in
San Francisco, but the statement that
the lower part of the building is to be
devoted to the sale of liquor has net
tled the body beyond endurance.
Dr- H. C. Jennings, the Rev. E. R.
Graham and Judge VV. F. Boyd arrived
in San Francisco last Thursday from
Cincinnati, the two former gentlemen
acting as the Western agents of the
Book Concern, and the last named as
their legal adviser. As stated exclu
sively in The Call last Saturday, they
recommended the local Methodists to
let the building go without a legal test
since the establishment of the saloon
seemed certain.
At the weekly meeting of the Metho
dist Preachers' Association yesterday
feeling ran high against all who have
had a hand in the disposal of the
property over the heads, as it is claim
ed, of the local commission and com
mittee. In the heat of debate C. B.
Perkins arraigned the parties concern
ed in no uncertain terms. Perkins said:
Before the fumes of beer and whisky have
been scented, before we hear the children's
cry and widow's groans from the saloon, be
fore the frte lunch counter tempts us from
the path of virtue and we move to our new
temporary quarters farther up Market street,
permit me to say In passing that although
the smoke of battle is clearing- away, th-Â»
most infamous outrage ever ' perpetrated on
Methodism of California was the selling of
this property. The diabolical manner in which
It was concocted, how It waa conceived In Â»in,
brought forth in iniquity anl nurtured in the
lap of spite and revenge cannot be soon for
gotten.
ENDANGER CONFIDENCE.
It would not take many transactions of this
character to destroy the confidence of our
people in the entire administration of the
church.
From information I have received since re
turning from New York, the proceedings were
absolutely illegal and the letter aa well as the
spirit of the discipline was violated and tha
annulment could have been secured from the
courts.
Who's responsible?
Let the man who signed the deed, and the
Judas lacariot, who betrayed his brethren for
a few pieces of silver answer. Their names
will always be held in contempt by all fair
minded nven in this city.
Such a gross violation of good faith and
brotherhood on the part of Christian men will
forever stand as a blot on the fair name of
Christianity, and a standing reproach to the
people called Methodists.
The cause of ("wrist in this city and in this
State has received a blow from which It can
not easily recover.
We have charged these men with unfairness
and unbrotherliness, treachery, disloyalty,
treason in permitting the church to be robbed
of about 520.000. The book committee,
composed of some nf the best men In Method-
Ism, after mature deliberation found them
guilty as charged; the local commission of
San Francisco found them guilty aa charged;
9fi per rent of the, California conference will
find them guilty as charged; every Methodist
layman in this city will find them guilty as
charged; the great Judge of all the earth will
find them guilty as charged.
CHURCH HAS BEEX WRONGED.
The Methodist church has been wronged by
the men elected to protect her Interest. Was
It not enough that for twelve years prior to
iftOO the depository In this city through crim
inal carelessness, if not something worse, was
plundered of between $100,000 and $200,000?
Has there not been sufficient scandal for the
last two years without the doors being again
opened by this high handed outrage?
Ijet the guilty ones answer.
1 have had my last say and want to see
the past blotted out if It Is at all possible.
A brighter day appears. Men who have some
regard for the truth, men who love the church
and our Methodism are In our midst to right
the wrung which has been done so far as they
are able to do so.
I have not said that this property â these
buildings â are well adapted to the business of
tlip Book Concern. I do not think they are.
The building facing Market street is all right
and a credit to the memory of John D. Hill,
who erected it. The brick structure of the
rear is a first-class abortion and a disgrace to
the architect who planned It and the people
who built it, and there Is an odor about It you
will all be glad to part with.
For tho next twelve months we will have
a comfortable abiding place until the new
property Is completed.
I feel sure the good brethren from Cincinnati
will do the very best they can. facing the
difficulties of a rising market.
Th~y have the money, they knew how to
invest It.
A handsome bonus of $2.">.000 has been placed

he should not engage in like business

â¢'The Labor Movement" was the sub
ject of an address by the Rev. Charles
Stelzle at the Presbyterian Ministers'
Association yesterday. Mr. Stelzle, a
former machinist and member of the
Machinists' Association, said that he
had found at the Labor Council he had
attended here an effort to swing In
politics, but there were many who ob
jected to politics on ethical grrounds.
They had learned to be suspicious of
politicians.
He inferred that the labor men felt
that they had not met with fairness on
account of the Mayor.
Mr. Stelzle said that the San Fran
cisco men had learned a valuable les
son. There was a feeling, he said,
against Socialism. The better part of the
members of the labor unions were op
posed to it. He denied that socialism
was supported by the majority.

THE BATTLE ON THE HUN.
THE success of Russia's campaign in Eastern Asia required the
command of the sea and the holding of Port Arthur. Japan
prepared herself by getting a foothold in Korea, as a means of
getting her forces on the mainland. Togo's masterly activity soon
supplemented this move by isolating Port Arthur on the water
side, and permitting the immediate investment of that fortress.
In the long and brilliant military career of Caesar one action
has been accepted by historians and military critics as the finest and
highest evidence of his genius as a soldier. When the Gauls aban
doned their policy of trying to hold several strongholds at once and
concentrated their whole force in the walled city of Alesia, under
the command of Yercingetorix, the reduction of that place by the
Latin army became a prime necessity. When the legions of Caesar
were before its walls and the siege was in progress, a vast army
came to its relief. Then Caesar without abandoning the siege faced
his army both ways, and at the same time overcame the army of relief
and took the city.
Oyama practically repeated these tactics at Port Arthur. When
-Kuropatkin moved down the peninsula to the relief of Port Arthur
Xogi was left to continue the siege and the forces of Kuroki were
faced the other way to meet the Russian relief. The Japanese field
marshal did not wait as Caesar did for an attack, but moved rapidly
to meet the enemy. Then followed the great engagements at Xan
Â«han hill and the immense battle of Liaoyang. in which the Rus
sians were turned and sent flying to their base at Mukden.
The fall of Port Arthur released all of Xogi's army to join
Kuroki and Oyama and Kawamura, and the movement on the Shahke
and the Hun began. The battle was one of the greatest in the
world's history. We are accustomed to associate war with pageantry
and spectacular effect. We think of battles in the terms of war
music and flying standards. The bugle and the banner, heroic war
cries, flashing swords and galloping squadrons, the screaming of
horses and the whistling of shells, make up the panorama of color,
action and sound. But the battle of Mukden had few of these fea
tures. The action covered a line a hundred miles long. By or
dinary means of travel it required four days to go from one extrem
ity of that line of fire and fury to the other. It began when the
Russian and Japanese lines were nearly straight and parallel. By
making a feint on the Russian center Oyama weakened Kuropatkin's
flanks, and then the Japanese lines began curving like a bow, and
the process of enveloping the Russian forces was under way.
Oyama'* plan required the highest tactical courage and the
greatest confidence in his troops. If Kuropatkin pierced his center
he was lost. To maintain even strength and resistance on a line of
a hundred miles was a military feat of the first order, and its success
puts Oyama among the greatest commanders and military strategists.
Every hour of the action, maintained in storms of snow and sleet
and dust, was solid fighting. There was no pageantry to relieve
the horrors of the scene. The giant Oyama met and overcame the
greatest of the Russian generals, and his armies entered the ancient
capital of Manchuria and rested by the tombs of the Manchu dy
nasty. Japanese and Russian had fought a ten days' battle, and had
shown the highest mark of courage, sacrifice and endurance. While
it is pitiful that such carnage can be. and humanity is staggered by
the sacrifice, the world cannot withhold its admiration of the stub
quality shared by Slav and Japanese alike.
The effect upon the western nations is peculiar. For centuries
the great actions at arms have been between nations of a common
race. Since the battle of Marathon, the western nations have warred
with each other and have seen but few great actions in which they |
were disinterested. The battle of Mukden is different. It was, ra
cially, between two oriental branches, and as it illustrates every
phase of the slaughter and savagery of war. its effect is to incline
the western world toward peace.
Xnne can at present foresee the final result. The Russians have
it much of their equipment. Enormous quantities of their mili
tary and food stores are in the hands of the Japanese, to the great
relief of Oyama's commissary and quartermaster branches. As much
as the Japanese are strengthened thereby the Russians are weak
ened, and if another battle come at Tie Pass the result can hardly
be in doubt. Kuropatkin's career is probably ended. He left Mos
v boasting that he would dictate terms of peace in Tokio, but an
army of Buddhists. Shintoists and Christians, led by the Presby
terian -.oldier Oyama. has made that boast a vain thing, and the

The Czars voice is still for war. but his best army is beaten
and another must be wrenched from the homes of a discontented
and unwilling people. They must be whipped into trains by Cos
sacks and shipped like cattle thousands of miles, to fall in a war that
I BO interest to them. It is very doubtful whether under such
circumstances another army will strongly defend the autocracy.
THE IGNORING POLICY.
WHEN" Congress closed its session and passed into history, the
Home was jocund with good fellowship. All the members
united in a testimonial to Speaker Cannon, and members of
the minority joined with the majority in expressions of kindness and
good feeling toward him. Then the Democratic members presented
to their leader, John Sharp Williams, a testimonial and were joined
by the members of the majority in expressions of approval and ap
probation of his course as a member and a party leader.
These scenes were gratifying and remarkable because they were
unusual* They were news of a high and proper order. They tended
to increase a feeling of fellow citizenship among the people. All of
the newspaper* of the country spread them as news. The personal
organs of Mr. Hearst, however, cut out all of the incident concerning
John Sharp Williams. Mr. Hearst aspires to leadership of the House
himself and does not like Mr. Williams because he is in the way.
For this reason Mr. Williams had to pass unhonored and unsung in
Mr. Hearst's papers, and Democrats who wanted to know what
their folks did in the last hours of the House had to find out by
reading the Republican and independent press.
Following out his policy, it will be in order for Mr. Hearst,
who is a member of the next Congress, to suppress all mention of
any Democrat in the House except himself. In this way he can
establish in the minds of his readers the fact that he alone is the
party in the House, standing like a Congressional David, knee deep
in the brook Kedron and hurling dornicks at the head of the Re
publican Goliath of Gath and other districts. Mr. Williams is on
the blacklist and must suffer the blight that comes of being ignored
by Mr. Hearst's papers. This see-something-say-nothing policy may
make a leader of Mr. Hearst, but it will never make newspapers out
-if his personal organs.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 14. 1905

KEITH GORDON
WHEN the young man at last
reluctantly furled his lines
lbout the long poles and
rtowed them away as best he
might in the covered buggy that he
had procured In the village, the
shadows were alreadj' long and pen
sive.
When he reached the village the
hush of early twilight lay on the
broad, decorous streets, which were
almost deserted. Their very empti
ness, however, was full of suggestive
cheer. Pictures of broad, low rooms
vith bountifully spread supper tables,
o:i which feathery biscuit, cold
chicken and preserves made a tempt
ing array, rose before hie dreamy
eyes: cheerful, natural faces loomed
in the thick, red light of old-fashion
ed lamps; the rag carpets, rocking
chairs and secretaries â all the details
of the rural household scene were
vividly, pleasurably before him.
Behind him, the long poles dipped
with a rhythmical, monotonous motion
as the horse jogged evenly along. At
the crossing of two streets the slight,
graceful figure of a girl paused for
him to pass. In the shadowy light she
seemed like a spirit â the spirit of the
advancing night.
Thus sunk, lost, wrapped in revery
hf drove on, the poles waving up and
dewn behind him like long, hungry
tentacles, exploring the evening air
for something to catch and hold. A
jolt and a rumble and the buggy roll
ed over the crossing with an energy
that sent the poles dipping lower than
ever, and then the tentacles hooked
something â hooked it tight, and after
a brief resistance on the part of the
hooked thing, which manifested a
strong inclination to remain where It
was â lifted it high in a triumph and
maliciously disappeared down the
dusky street, leaving a paralyzed,
shadowy shape staring after it with
astounded eyes.
For a moment the girl stood speech-
U-ss. bewildered. To have her hat sud
denly plucked from her hoad. as if by
a hand thruet from the sky, in a
sleepy little village of the new world â
well, it was an experience that stopped
her mental machinery with a Jerk.
Had it been in Greece in the year
something or other B. C, it would
have been explicable, as the deed of
some goddess, jealous and angered at
the beauty of her love of a hat. Jeal
ous goddesses, she recalled, had done
even more extraordinary things than
snatching a mortal's hat!
Or had it been later, in medieval
times, she might have ascribed this
hat-lifting to black magic: But In
the U. S. A. in the year of 1905
neither of these exnlanations could
hold, and that was the reason she
stood as if she had taken root, while
these thoughts shot rapidly through
her mind.
Meanwhile her hat, dancing up and
down in a tantalizing, diabolical fash
ion, as if to wave her a mocking- fare
well, was being borne, slowly but in
exorably, into the -gloaming. Before
she recovered the power of spee <h and
motion the buggy was half way down
the block. She made a step after it,
then stopped. She had a sharp, hu
morous vision of herself, hatless and
disheveled, pursuing that dancing,
mocking, bobbing will-o'-the-wisp of
a hat through the village streets, mak
ing frantic, ineffectual Jumps at it, as
a dog at a biscuit held just beyond
Its reach, and the vision caused her
to pause.
"Here! Oh, 1 say, stop, won't you?"
she called imploringly, but the quad
ruped drawing the buggy proceeded,
with a dexterity that reminded her
of the juggler who keeps four balls
in the air at the same time, while the
fall of its hoofs came to her In a more
and more distant cadence.
FASHION'S MIRROR.
A calling and carriage costume of mauve broadcloth simply trimmed
with small gold buttons. The Louis coat has small revers top and bot
tom of very pale green silk and a white lace collar and chemisette are
worn. The hat is an artistic confection in mauve velvet and pale green
chiffon.
For a moment the girl stood
speechless.
"Oh, man!" she called desperately,
but the owner of the fishing rods was
wandering In a dream-world, sniffing
the damp, earthy, evening smells,
communing with the approaching
spirit of night, deaf to any but trum
pet voices.
"Well!" she exclaimed explosively,
with an energy that emptied her lungs
to the remotest corners. "Well, I like
that! I'd just like to know what I'm
going to do?"
And in answer to the query, the
officious, obtrusive, sub-conscious self
set her in motion, and she found her
self heading toward her boarding
place to the monotonous inward wail
of "And It's the only hat I have with
me!"
Meanwhile the young man drove
on musingly, blissfully, until he reached
the house where he was staying, all
unconscious of his latest and most un
usual "catch." The light was stream
ing warmly from the windows as he
drove past the side of the house, up to
the barn and jumped out.
At the sight of the dark object dim
ly visible at the end of his poles, he
stared in surprise. A moment later,
when he had carried them into the
patch of light from the nearest win
dow, his hands dropped helplessly.
There it was, a trim, natty hat â a
woman's hat. On no â a girl's hat.
Even to his groping masculine sense
there was something coquettish, play
ful, alluring about it. But there it
was, held firmly as an ensnared fish
by the two sharp hooks, surely the
strangest object a fisherman ever
caught.
"Where'd it come from?" demand
ed the boy who had come out to un
harness the horse. Then, suddenly,
as if the joke were just revealed to
him, he burst into a loud guffaw, in
which the young man joined in spite
of himself.
Later on he worked it out. It must
belong to the slender young girl who
had waited for him to drive past. He
remembered distinctly now that she
had poised there at a certain cross
ing, waiting for him to get by. a sort
of shadow srirl -.vho had seemed a part
of his musings. Doubtless she had
passed close behind the buggy and
the bobbing poles with the dangling
hooks had parodied the tragedy of
STARTING OF AMERICAN
SURGERY OF THE
BRAIN.
American brain surgery started in a
Massachusetts stone quarry- An Irish
laborer, jamming a crowbar into a hole
where part of a charge of dynamite
| was lying in wait, produced the logical
: result, the crowbar entering the head
at the side of the Jaw and projecting a
foot cut beyond the vault of the skull.
l The foreman notified the coroner; some
! one else sent for a doctor. The doctor
1 got there first, removed the crowbar
i and took the patient to the hospital,
i where, to the amazement of the entire
| profession, the man recovered. Up to
: that time the brain substance had been
| regarded as prohibited territory, but,
j the doctors reasoned, surely a surgeon's
I knife can go where a one-inch crowbar
can pass without fatal results. â Samuel
j Hopkins - Jams, in McClure's.
THE SENSIBLE SWISS.
Our friends of the picturesque cos
tumes and customs who dwell within
the shadow of the Alps are a pretty
level-headed folk. While in a sense
isolated from the busy world and liv
ing a life almost Arcadian In its sim
plicity, the Swiss are by no means lag
gards in the march of progress. We
delight to boast of our public school
system, but the education given in the
schools of Switzerland is in many re
spects more comprehensive and prac
tical than that offered In our currlcu
lums. The girls, for Instance, are
taught not only to read and write and
spell, but to cook, to wash, to sew, says
Robert Webster Jones in the March
, Housekeeper. In addition to being
trained for the duties of homemaking
and housekeeping, each girl is taught
some useful trade. Many of the pu
pils are daughters of rich parents and
there is little likelihood of their ever
having to earn their own living, but
the paternal government takes the
view that every member of society
should possess the ability to be self
supporting, even though the necessity
to exercise that ability should never
arise.
The boys, too, have not been neglect
ed In the Swiss system of education.
Physical culture and manual training
have prominent places in the curricu
lum, and every boy on leaving the pub
lic school is equipped to earn his own
living. Fads and frills are absent from
the Swiss schools. The hard-headed
taxpayers want to see some return for
their money. They demand that the
education for which they pay shall be
practical and useful in after life.

A FAIRY TALE.
Once upcn a time there was an auto
mobileâwhich ran slowly and carefully
through- the streets of the city. â¢ â¢ â¢
â Fliegende Blaetter.
_â¢ ' â¢ v : ...
Absalom. But how should he find
her and restore her headgear?
The same problem was tormenting
the brain of the owner of the hat, and
as a result the postmistress received
two notices within the next hour, with
the request that she put them up in
the Dostoffice.
"If the person whose carelessness"
â the word carelessness was under
stored â "led to the unlawful acquisi
tion of a hat last evening will leave
same with the postmistress the owner
will feel in some measure placated,"
read the first one. And the second
was l'ke this: "If the owner of a hat
that mysteriously disappeared on
Tuesday evening will leave her name
and address with the postmistress it
will be returned immediately."
Before nocn of the following day
the young man, now thoroughly alert
and no longer the dreamy, heedless
fellow of the night before, might have
been seen wending his way along one
of the broad, shaded streets of the
village, gingerly carrying a parcel
wrapped in tissue paper. His anxious
scrutiny of the houses showed that
he sought some familiar place, but at
last, after a final vacillating moment
he opened a gate and went in.
In the comfortable, old-fashioned
parlor he waited for the owner of the
hat; waited â though he did not know
that until later â for the appearance of
the lady of his life. It was not that .
she was wonderously fair or in any .
way distinguished, as the heroines of
the story books always are. He never
Just found out why it was, but from
the moment that the slender, girlish
figure appeared in the doorway and I
turned quizzical eyes upon him, his
heart beat to a new, strong theme.
"But didn't you hear me call?" she
asked when they had laughed, ex- !
plained and apologized, he for cap- \
turing the hat and she for the under- â 
scored word in her notice. "Didn't
you hear me shout, "Oh, man. stop?" :
He shook his head penitently, for
even so soon it seemed incredible that
with her voice calling he should not
have heard. Then the talk turned to
other things, and with a glad sort of
a shock he discovered that In town
they lived in the same square.
"And to think that I have never j
seen you," he exclaimed with slow i
wonder, as if the thing were scarcely
credible, and thereupon the girl
laughed, for she had seen him again
and again, always with a warm ap- j
proval of his swinging gait and a cer
tain air that said that he could look â 
out for himself and somebody else
beside. Once, she remembered, she '
had wondered who the somebody !
would be.
"Probably it's because you never |
fished for me before," she ventured j
mischievously, and then she caught
her lip between her teeth and wished :
she hadn't spoken, for his face be- I
came very earnest, and there was a
conquering ring in his voice as he an
swered slowly but determinedly:
"Perhaps so. But from now on, 1
am going to fish for years if need be â
fish until you yield from sheer weari
ness of seeing me sitting motionless I
on the bank â until I can win you for
my own."
And he kept his word so well that
now they not only live in the same
.square, but in the same house. (Copy

We're marching on to freedom, through

A crimson thread is in the east, and

We're hopelessly defeated; let the joyous
news be shouted.
Our armies are in full retreat and soon
we shall be free. Â»
Outfought and outmaneuvered, outflank
ed and raked and routed.
Three hundred thousand beaten men
are singing like the sea.
Our forces fill the valleys full: the plain
is overflowing;
Our bayonets clothe the trampled earth
like fields of sloping corn.
Above the distant mountain tops, the
light is slowly growing;
A scarlet cord is in the east, and soon
it will be morn.

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Par.* Hanpen, rated A. B. in the mer
chant marine, insisted on scaling tele
graph poles on Third street at 3 o'clock
iy morning, despite Patrol
mar. Pu!!:van's command that he not
remain on terra firma, but move
onward. It was at Third street's inter
section with Howard tne policeman
first saw the mariner nimbly "shin
ning" a pole supporting electric lipht
wires, and the policeman utilized the
authority in him vepted to order an im
mediate descent.
Aye. aye, sir," cheerfully responded
Mr. Hanson, pausing in his climb, "but
the first mate has Just told me to put
out the masthead light."
"If you touch any of those wires up
there, it will be all off with you,"
shouted the officer, realizing he had a
rr.lnd deranged to deal with. "Let the
masthead light alone till dawn and
come down here."
"Aye, aye, sir; you're the skipper, an'
I takes your orders fust," said the
man and in i t-.vink);np he was beside
The poMrpmar and saluting: him with
grreai deference.
"Now, go home." he was command
ed, and muttering "Aye, aye, sir," he
ambled unsteadily toward the bay. But
the very next polo he came to proved a
temptation too strong to resist, and up
It he clambered with the agility of a
monkey. Then the policeman, after en
ticirsK him back to- earth, placed him
under arrest for disturbing the peace,
and no sooner did the prisoner appreci
ate hi? position that he fought so
fiercely as to earn an additional charge
of battery. ,
"It was the liquor, sir," he said to
Police Judge Mogan.
Judgment reserved till to-morrow.

Marukishi Narumi, a little brown
man. was arfe.=t^d for disturbing the
peace of certain young women employ
ed as clerks in the office of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company,
415 Post street, by standing on the side
walk and peerintr through the window
and kissing his fingers and convulsive
ly pressing the left side of hts cheat
with both his hands and making other
dem<iris;rc. : ons of lovesirkness. The
compJaint was sworn to by E. P. Ma
honey, a clerk In the office, and none of
the fair objects of the defendant's ado
ration appeared in Judge Mogans
f-ourt to prosecute him.
'Have you ever been confined in an
insane asylum?" his Honor inquired,
the query being justified by the little
man's erratic demeanor.
"Don' try to mak dam fool of me."
was the fiercely delivered response, ac
companied by: a gesture indicating de
sire to pick up and use as a missile a
book that was lying upon the Judge's
desk. If assault was really intended a
vigilant bailiff prevented it.
If you are not c lunatic." pursued
the court, "why do you persecute those
young ladies?" . :. .'
â¢\Vy perjp^cuf? ,W'y persecuf?" was
the fervently uttered explanation. "I
yfereecuf 'cause I loves gal with all her
heart." And hitÂ« open hands struck his
breast with resounding, whack.
â¢'Well, you must stop it," said the
Judge.
I stop it Wen I dam please," said
the d*Â»feno"fcnt.
v are a pest, and very impudent."
said the Judge. ""Will you take your
sentence now or wait till to-morrow
for it?"
"I know my dam fate this day," was
the answer.
'All right," said the Judge; "ninety

"Tank you not much," said Maru

! End music hall, when Judge Mogan |
asked her why she had paraded lower ;
Pacific street at 4 - o'clock Sunday '
morning and loudly warbled, "I Won- ,
der What's the Matter With the Mail. ' :
She was billed to formally launch the
song that night, she further explained,
and it was to perfect herself in the j
melody that she awoke the â  outdoor
echoes. It might not be amiss to add >
that when she did launch it the audi
ence unanimously pronounced It the hit '
of a season, fairly bristling with hits.
Case continued till to-morrow.

trolman Herlihy, who testified Mr.
: Kelly was a "cigar store statue," also
a "fashion-plate," and had no visible ;
means of maintenance other than that
of posing on Kearny street during the
shopping hours. Continued till March j

"Why don't you Jack up them po- |
licemen that don't kick orange skins â¢

Lopez's answer to Judge Fritz's query !
as to why she reclined upon a Barbary
Coast footway. Then she went on to
explain that while she was sauntering;
homeward she inadvertently placed one
of her feet upon an orange skin and
immediately sat down and was still re- 'â 
cumbent when Patrolman O'Connell \
picked her up and booked her for ;
drunkenness. i
After the Judge had murmured ;
something anent orange skins on side- â¢
walks being the real yellow peril, he
asked the policeman as to Miss Lo- !
pez's mental condition at the time of â 
her arrest, and the policeman said she â¢
: was drunk and incapable of pedestrian- ;
ism; furthermore that only a few j

i private soldiers stationed at the Presi- (
dio, were accused of battering" 'Anton's â¢'
i Bollizl, dealer in fruits and'Vege&ibMes
on Fillmore street, near Lombard. The >
! testimony showed that the defendant?
entered Si^nor Bolizzl's store with the
avowed intent of purchasing two crabs
which were displayed for sale in the
window, and that Signer Bolizzi, who
had in his arms the latest addition to a
somewhat numerous progeny, demand
ed for the crustaceans a price which
the visitors pronounced exorbitant.
During the altercation. Signor Bolizzi
averred. Private Dignan called him a
dago, with uncomplimentary adjective
prefixed, and then struck him, where
upon Signor Bolizzi, retaining his grasp
of the habÂ» with one hand, seized a
hammer and attempted to protect him
self from a threatening repetition of the
assault.
"Lay down the kid," Private Dig
nan was alleged to have said, "and I'll
lick you, hammer or no hammer."
Signor Bolizzi prudently declined the
invitation to disarm, and while the
soldiers two were blustering and ap
parently deciding upon a strategic
simultaneous attack, the caJf of one
of Private Dignan's legs was sudden
ly seized by the Jaws of a bulldog
owned by Signor Bolizzi, who, thus re
inforced, wielded his hammer with such
effectiveness as to drive the enemy to
the street, where it was arrested.
The soldiers tr.ld a different story, of
course, declaring that Signor Bolizzi
and his dog monopolized the violent
conduct. In view of the fact that the
dog evened up the odds and that th^
soldiers reaily got the worse of what
ever actual fighting occurred, Judge
Cabaniss dismissed them.
Howard Caradoc Rees, the former
New York clubman who was once
consigned to a sanitarium by Judge
Mogan. reappeared before that magis
trate on a repetition of the charge that
he had threatened the life of R. H.
Gignoux. He was comparatively quiet
mannered, as he pleaded not guiliy
and displayed to the court a letter pur
porting to have been written to him
in 1900 by Elihu Root, then Secretary
of War. approving his work as a Gov
ernment agent at the Paris Exposition.
Asked if he would accompany back to
New York the brother who has tele
graphed his willingness to come for
him. he said he would prefer to travel
with his father, but might accept his
brother as an escort if he were al
lowed to produce ex-Senator Frank
McGowan to testify as to his character.
Then the hearing was continued till
to-day.
Patrolman J. E. Doten. who accused
Attorney Walter J. Grady of having
refused to "move on" last Saturday
evening at Third and Mission streets.
told Judge Cabaniss that the defendant
railed him "a fresh cop" and then de
rlinc-d to go quietly to prison unless he
â¢sv^re conveyed thlthÂ«r !n a hack. After
remarking that a police patrol wagon
affords just as comfortable riding as
does a hack. Judge Cabaniss dismissed
the rase.

ous municipal departments to the pro- ;
visions of the act recently passed by j
the Legislature and signed by the Gov
ernor, providing that every Saturday, !
from 12 o'clock noon until 12 o'clock i
midnight, shall be a holiday as regards
the transaction of business in the pub-
He offices of this State, and also In po- i
litical divisions thereof, whose laws, or- j
dinances or charters provide that pub- i
lie offices may be closed on holidays.
The committee will inquire as to the !
legal application of the law to city of-*j
flees.
Edward Graney's attorney appeared ;
before the Finance Committee to urge j
that his client's bills, aggregating some ;
$2000 for shoeing the horses of the Fire I
Department, which have been "held
up" for several months, be allowed.
"We do not consider that we should I
pass these demands," said Supervisor ',
d'Ancona, "in view of the fact that we |
notified the Fire Commission that we |
would not approve the demands and
that there was a fraudulent agreement
on the part of that body to give the
horseshoeing contract to Graney."
The â committee promised to give the
matter "serious consideration."
An ordinance was passed to print de- j
daring Baker street, from Golden '
Gate avenue to Turk, to be a public ,
boulevard upon which no railroad shall ;
ever be constructed and prohibiting ;
heavy traffic thereon.
The roadways of Hugo street, be- j
tween Third and Fourth avenues: Ste- '
venson street, near Tenth, and Eliza- ;
both street, betv/een Sanchez and Xoe, ,
were accepted.
The Board of Work* was authorized
to sell a lot of old material stored in
the corporation yard.
The ordinance fixing May 1, 1905, as
the date upon which the board will re
ceive sealed bids for sewer bonds
amounting to $443,600 and school bonds
in the sum of $427,000 was finally
passed.
Similar action was taken on the reso
lutions authorizing the payment to the
F. M. Torke Company of $3645 and
$2168. respectively, on its August and
September demands for repairs to bi
tuminous pavements. The demands
were cut down by some $4500 and the
company will bring suit against the ,
city to compel payment of the balance
Claimed to be due. !
The Auditor was authorized to em- 1
ploy three civil service clerks for throe \
months to assist in the refunding of
the illegal special tax of 15 cents col
lected in 1902 for hospital and schools, i
Justices' Clerk McComb filed a state- 1
ment that $27,340 will be required for
his department during the fiscal year
1305-06. Of that amount $18,000 is for
the salaries of the five Justices of the
Peace, which were raised from $2400 to

PHILBKOOK CASE
IS KICKED OUT
Judge Morrow Orders the
"Scurrilous and Scandal
- ous" Complaint Off Files
NATURAL LAW DEFINED
Court Says That Parent's
Eight to Custody of His
Children Is Only Limited
Horace W. Philbrook suffered the
mortification yesterday of having his ,
pet case, legally speaking, kicked out j
of the United States Circuit Court. It \
had been filed by him many months \
ago on behalf of his client, John. L.
Wadleigh, to recover $50,000 damages ;
from Edwin W. Newhall for having
comptred with If. J. White, Herbert J. j
Lewis and others to commit twelve
felonies and thirty-nine misdemeanors
against the person and the rights of
his client. The salient point of the :
voluminous complaint was that on [
January 29, 1903, M. J. White and two i
policemen took from Wadleigh by force :
and violence his four children. May j
now aged 17 years, John 15, Sarah 13, I
Solomon 10 and Helen 4. In sustaining |
the demurrer and granting the motion
to atrik* the complaint from the flies,
Judge Morrow said
The court consider* the question whether <
the State had authority to confer upon the ]
Superior Court the power to appoint a ruarf- j
ian for the plaintiff's minor children. It ,
seems then that by the law of nature a father
ha* no paramount Inviolabl* right to the cus- â 
tody of his children. And the civil or municl- â¢
pal law in setting bounds to his parental au- <
thoiity ami in entirely or partially depriving ]
him of it In cases where the Interest and wel- j
fare of his children require It. does not coma
in conflict with or subvert any of the other !
principles of the natural law. ThÂ« moment ;
a child is bom It owes allegiance to the Gov- j
ernnunt of the country of ltÂ« birth, and !s
entitled to the protection of that Government.
The demurrer Is therefore sustained- The
court is of the opinion that this complaint
containing these scurrilous and scandalous !
charges should not be allowed under the cir
cumstances to remain on the files of the
court.

POOR SERVICE
IN THE SUBWAY
C<ir Lines in New York Still
Unable to Handle the Big
Crowds at the Eush Hours
STRIKERS GOING BACK
Over a Thousand of the
Men Who Walked Out
Given Their Old Positions
NEW YORK, March 13.â Traffic on
all the elevated roads and in the sub
way was handled in a manner that
failed to give adequate service during
the rush hours to-day. It seemed as if
the people had forgotten in a degree
over Sunday the conditions that ob
tained last week. They crowded ele
vated and subway stations, fought to
board expresses and avoided front and
rear cars. Service in the subway was
irregular and at all stations the police
and the employes were rendered al
most helpless by the crowds on the
platform.
A number of the old employes have
been reinstated, and they were given
charge of the expresses, but the irreg
ularity of the locals, run by strike
breakers, rendered the efforts to im
prove the service fruitless. Over 1000
strikers have been given their old po
sitions, and the company is consider
ing the application of many others.
Several minor accidents occurred dur
ing the day.
NEW YORK POLICEMAX
INHERITS TWO FORTUNES
One Comes From Oakland and the
Other From Relative in
England.
NEW YORK, March 13.â Jeremiah
Barber, a policeman who has served
the city four years, has, it is reported,
fallen heir to two fortunes aggregating
nearly $300,000.
The first notice of his good fortune
came from Oakland, Cal., where the po
liceman's uncle. James Elfar, died re
cently. Barber was on strike duty and
had not been home in four days, when
his wife hurried to the station with a
letter announcing that her husband
had been willed the bulk of his uncle's
estate. When the husband and wife
hod embraced each other over the sud
den opulence the force gathered about
and wrung the policeman's hand until
it ached.
Barber went out on post duty and his
wife went home. At midnight she
came back in a cab with a cablegram
announcing the legal disposition of an
estate o-f. another uncle at Ramsgate,
England, which had been in litigation
a couple of years. The policeman, ac
cording to the cablegram, was entitled
under tho decision to about $100,000.
LEITER TO SHUT DOWN
THE MINE AT ZEIGLER
Unsatisfactory Results Obtained From
the Foreign Unskilled Labor
That Is Employed.
DUQUJESNE, 111., March 13.â A re
port based on seemingly reliable au
thority was received here this evening
to the effect that Joe Leiter will defi
nitely suspend operations at his Zeigler
mine on the 15th of the present month.
For some time it has been generally
understood that the results obtained in
the output of coal have failed to meet
the expectations of the company.
This is due, no doubt, to the fact
that nearly every foreign type of labor,
for the most part unskilled, is repre
sented there and is unable to produce a
satisfactory output. Thus far this
month, the report adds, but thirty-six
cars of coal, aggregating 1500 tons,
have been exported from the mine.

CAPITALIST LOSES CONTROL
OF HIS $3,000,000 ESTATE
Divorce Case Results in Action by the
Court Against George F.
Harding.
CHICAGO, March 13.â The Appel
ate Court to-day refused to reverse an
order of the Circuit Court, which two
months ago took from George F.
Harding, a well known attorney and
capitalist, control of his $3,000,000
estate. The action of the Appellate
Court is the latest phaae of sensation
al divorce litigation which has occu
pied the courts here and in Califor
nia for many years.
Harding's wife secured an order for
alimony several years ago, but has
never been able to collect. The ali
mony now amounts to $30,000. To
defeat his wife's efforts, Harding is
alleged to have transferred all his in
terests to a real estate loan and trust
company. By the decision of the Ap
pellate Court a way is opened for full
inquiry in court into the workings of
the company.

"That a change for the better in the Pruas
market is impending Is ballered to be Indi
cated by the strong views now expressed in
quarters from whence only b**riÂ»h talk has
emanated for a lon* Ume past. In fact, the
belief is entertained by eotne in the trade that
.- prominent interests have scoured such control
of tbe coast stocks as to insure, an early Im
provement In prices. Until within a day or

orders for carload lota lor shipment from the

Supplementing the recent improvement in home

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, March â The whipping up
â¢. the stock market on Saturday aroused
Sibur.car.'. expectations of a - further rise to
f,tj The opening course of prices waa in
acoorda.nc* with this Â«xpecta.tlon- The heavy
Â»Â«::iiig to take profits met this rise and was
etrlctiy according to established precedent. " It
â¢was the subsequent tendency of the market
for which experienced operators watch with
keen attention to estimate the tone. This
latter tendency confirmed thÂ«. persisting
etrenrth which underlies the stock market and
offered a fresh surprise la the absorptive
pewrr cf the speculation and the unlimited
cc-tfidf-nce with which buying follows ' prices
to fc'.?hpr flights. The usual weekly reviews
ot tra.flc condition* by railroad officials served
as strong corroboration of the confidence which
Is felt la business conditions. A very fret
movement of all grades of traffic and es
pecially steÂ«l and iron products and of higher
gTafles of merchandise were marked features
of the movement and were cited as irround
for the faith expressed by railroad officials
of very prosperous conditions 'or an indefinite
period in the future. Improved weather con
ditions are helping out the . operating depart
ments ajid facilitating the movement of freight.
eJtbcugh the car supply is still insufficient to
. fccccmrcGdate all of the business offered.
La&rge railroad earnings are to be looked for
in consequence of the showing of expected
incoming reports. The continued ease of the
money market is the most Important foster
ing Influence on, the situation. The heary
volume cf bank clearings, which witnessed
trade activity in the country, continued pur
cfcases of new railroad bond issues by bank- i
Ing houses and the active demand for money
for speculation are without any impression on
tlic money market. The country's domestic
exj>erts for February showed a growth in
com experts sufficient to overcome the falling
off In wheat and flour, leaving- the low price
or cotton alone reÂ«ponelb!e for - the decline
from last year's level. â¢ The confidence en
g-erdered by the strong elements in the gen
eral business and financial situation are un
doubtedly the sustaining factor* in the market
and the ground for the disregard by the
cibctilative clement of the constant exhorta.
tioi. toward caution and toward restriction of !
buying which comes from 1 large element cf
conservative commission houses in .the Wall
street district. Warnings of this character,
based on the great rise which . has already
occurred In etccks and the present high level
of pric*s Seem to have little force in face
ct the unclouded prospect for business and
Industry- Frequent digestion of profits by the
board-rocm operators is the most table
effect cf the cautionary advice plentiful in the
street. The profit -taking.: which was constant
to-day, made a considerable inroad in the
rrarket during the afternoon and the subre
ouent rally did not recover ail that was
yielded, but the closing was strong and active.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future : Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, : March 13.â Excellent ' cash , de
mand in the Northwest - caused â a â  strong close
in the ! wheat market here to-day ,v May \ being
up l%c : and July 1%c ... At thÂ« : opening May
was l'%c lower to 9s,c higher at 'sl-09 -to $1 12
and â¢ July was a shade to %@%o higher â at
91Mi0 to 92c. The wide | fluctuations | In ' May
were due ;to : a rumor that \ the Illinois Ware- |
house Commission would: declare No. Oregon j
red' wheat to be deliverable on contracts hferfcr.
Actual - trading In the . May option, Â¥. howeyey'
was . of ' small volume, stop-loss ;' orders bewg
the principal . feature. The \ July delivery j
showed a- considerable firmness, a â¢ decreased i
movement ; in the I Northwest , being ; mainly I re
sponsible for the comparative strength ' of that
option, " On the : sharp break ;in ', May , : shorts
covered moderately. ; and .the price '. soon -'â¢ re
gained a large part of ; the â  initial ; loss. The
best demand, however, was for July. As trad-
Ing progressed ' the demand became more ur
gent, resulting in decided strength. . Reports
from Minneapolis of large sales iof cash wheat
have been a stimulating effect : on speculative
trading I here. Primary , receipts . -.. also ; were
small. â  The market closed almost at: the high
est point of the day. with May at $1 13 and
July at 93@93&c. â¢
From ' start -to finish - the- corn market was
active and strong. May opened higher
at 48 1 -4 c Ito j 4S^o and : closed â¢at 49@49%0.'. .; â¢
Strength of corn was the main factor in the
oat market. - May closed %c higher at 31% c
Provisions . were a trifle . easier early, : but
later regained the low in Â». sympathy with
strength of grains. At the close May pork was
up 2 Hie/- lard was . unchanged and ribs were a
shade higher. â¢

Decidtious and Citrus Fruits.
Trade in the Orange market was quiet owing
to the wet wrather. but there was no change
In prices. High prices were still being ex
acted for sound offerings of fancy fruit, while
the lower grade*, which were mostly poor,
were less firmly held. Jobbers manifested but
little interest in the auction and .the sale
passed oft quietly. Six carloads, Including only
one par of fancy fruit, were sold aa follows:
Fancy Navels. $1 10@l CO; choice do.
$1 30: standards, 65c4ifl. The managers of
the auction company announced that a special
sale would be held to-iiay to dispose of several
carloads, delayed In transit by the storm
There was nothing of Interest to report in other
Citrus fruits, which sold slowly at previous
prices Apples were weak, particularly cook

STOCK MARKET.
An Interesting Day In Both Local and
Mining Shares.
The : feature of \ the market yesterday was |
in the Comstock mining shares, a large opera
tor being sold out of . his . Hale A Norcross
stock, said to be for margin â  account, the '
action depressing - the . quotations from 91 10
to 01c; though the stock recovered to 70c in
the afternoon, closing at ; 67c bid. â  The rest i
of : the Comstocks felt - the . influence of â  this -
drastic proceeding : and were unsettled. Ophlr j
rose to $7 37 on the morning â  session, but j
fell back to $7 bid,- at the close, while the
. rest of â  these shares â¢ were - more :or less un- |
settled. The Tonopahs â â  were comparatively â 
quiet and featureless and the oil stocks were
dull, as usual. >
The feature : on . the , Stock and ' Bond â '" Ex
change was the advance In Contra, Costa Water ,
: from S4S ;to *52 50 as : a result of the failure j
the water bond issue to carry at the elec- \
tien in Oakland on : Saturday. Another . stock J'
to show strength was Gas and Electric, which, i
under the dividend... rose from $54 50 to 156. I
The sugar stocks were weak. Hawaiian declin- !
ing from ' $88 25 to $87 and x Paauhau from [
$:?Â« to $25. -. the â¢ others remaining - about the
same. Transactions In \ bonds. were not large.
â  San L' Francisco Gas â  and -Electric Company
on March 8 declared a dividend of $1 26 per I
share, amounting to f 198,105 41. payable

ASK GOVERNOR
TO VETO BILLS
Supervisor? Oppose Laws
Which Will Prevent Acqui
sition of Water Supplies
To BETTRX SPECIAL TAX
( laininnts Who Paid Hos
pital and School Levy Can
Now (,et Their Money Back
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution requesting Gov
ernor Pardee to veto Senate bills Use
E66 to 571, amending the Civil Code,
which adds water stored in reservoirs
or flowing in pipes to the property
which may be taken under the power
of eminent domain, and Senate bill So.
5T2, which provides that the Supervis
ors of any county in which water is
stored, or through -.vhich it flows, for
use in another county, must, upon the
dTnand of twenty Lents, commence
proceedings for the condemnation of
euch water.
Tht !Â«-olution recites that the
amendments are in violation of the
cardinal juinciple of eminent domain,
that property can only be taken for a
m<-.re necessary public use than that to
which it is already devoted, and that
where a portion of property is taken in
the txercise of the right, and such tak
ing, lenders other property useless, then
the ineatuit of damages shall be the
vaiue of the whole of such property.
That if said measures should became
laws they would practically render im
possible the acquisition of any public
water supply for the city and county
of San Fiar.cisco, by putting it into the
power of any twenty residents of a
cc-unty in which such water might be
itoied. or through which it might pass,
to compel the Supervisors of such
county to condemn said water and pay
therefor its value as water only, even
though such taking would destroy
vcrks of immerse value.
The board also adopted a resolution
asking the Governor not to approve
Senate bill No. 233. which is designed
to establish a method by which muni
cipalities may acquire existing electric
lighting end gas.
The resolution says that the method
Is impracticable and would operate
only to prevent municipalities from
â¢ever acquiring such works, and the bill
is an unwarranted attempt of the Leg
islature to interfere with the municipal
affairs of this city and county and of
other cities and towns of this State,
besides depriving them of the exercise
of their just powers.
"mmitiee from thf hoard will go
; unento '"-day t â¢> the
Governor apuinst thf- bills described.
The committee was erected to pro
test against any bill affecting the right
of the municipality to govern Itself, in
cluding one to compel the payment of
the, legal rate of interest on the cÂ«sn
value of water works instead of 5 per
cent on the original cost of the plant.
The board adopted a resolution or
dering the return of the special levy of
15 cents for schools and hospital as 11
lc=al under authority of; a legislative
amendment. Claimants for the refund
ing of the taxes are to nic with the
board their original tax bills for the
fiscal year 1902-1903 or certificates is
sued by the Tax Collector showing that
the taxes have been paid, attached to
a demand upon the city treasury. The
claims are to be verified by oath and
if fou/id correct shall be ordered paid.
The resolution granting permission to
Jake Raver to explode blasts for grad
ing purposes on his lot on Ellis street,
between Gough and Octavia, was final
ly passed.

"LA TOSCA" SUPPLIES
SHEEHAN BETTER ROLE
Tenor's Voice Purer
Than in Former
Operas.
Stage Settings Are
Bg factor in â¢
Success,
Even the third week of grand opera
a la Savage has hardly accustomed
one to settings that are as respectful
as those of musical comedy. The
mounting of "La Tosca" last night was
at least as fine as the Tivoli gave to
"The Toreador," andâ though it is what
one doesn't dare to call bourgeois, but
is, to speak of th? frame before the
picture â it counted heavily. The first
scene, '.vith its distant frescoed chapel,
pierced with shafts of topaz and azure
light v from stained glass, with its
pageantry o f priest and acolyte, scar
let-gowned cardinal and gayly uni
formed soldier, floating banner and
nther processional splendors, is moft
gratefully remembered. So, too, is the
last scene on the ramparts of Scar
!>ia c- castle, with its clever effect of
dawn. However. the opera's the
thing.
Mr. Sheehan was most of it last
night, with a delightfully sung Cavaro
dossi. one had heard that Mr. Shee
han was not in good form. His Othello
âone has already mentioned the
many good things it was not â was his
only work of my acquaintance, though
I hail heard of broken high C's â un
pardonable sin! âin his Manrico of
thÂ»- other night. Last night the tenor
did some of those things that were
heralded of him. Dramatically he
uns rather comfortable than strenu
ous, though in the climax of the tor
ture scene he had a moment that
sizzled \v?th the rest. But when it
<â  mi" to the singing one discovered
what has so far been lost to the season
by Mr. Sheehan being out of voice.
Thi> voi<e has an excellent sonority,
great sweetness, smoothness, and a
volume that lifted to the utmost
exigencies of the role. Perhaps his
prettiest bit of singing was don<- in
the duet of the last act. and here,
despite the applause censor, the Itch
ing nalm had Its say. Hut throughout
the Singer was adequate ami much
more, and in his most strenuous
moments the voice lost no whit of its
beauty.
That delightfulest of villainsâ after
Carmen one would certainly prefer of
all the naughty stage folk to sing
Bcarptaâ was Winfred Goff's charge.
Mr. Goff died beautifully. With La
Puma's walking feather-bed of a Scar
piaâwho, too, with hilarious economy
blew out his own death -candles â so re
cently in memory, Mr. Goff's imper
sonation came rather satisfactorily.
But it wasn't real wicked. It wanted
in that lovely shivery, sinister villainy,
wanted, too, in courtliness and polish;
wanted, too, ifa the brutality under it
all. Ytt in part Mr. Goff's Scarpia had
all of these and was moreover a hand
si me picture. His "lines" were sung
in smooth and unobtrusive fashion,
and his vocal quality is .always agree
able.
Miss Rennyson was the Tosca and
Miss Rennyson shouldn't do it again.
Life may be very serious, but it is
miles from being as serious anywhere
as Miss Rennyson's comedy. As dire
fully conscientious as Mayor Schmitz
leading the Handel "Largo" was Miss
Rennyson's coquetry â and as amusing.
Nor anywhere fromÂ» a persistent self
lousaess betraying itself largely in
constant attitudinizing â granted, quite
possibly Che result of excessive con
s<icntiousnessâdid she convince in the
character. But Miss Rennrson did
i-mt- charming singing, though there
is nor enough of the voice to express
thf- big passion of the role. But the
part is temperamentally distinctly out
of her metier.
Of th< rest, Mr. Boyle did an excel
lent character sketch as the Sacristan,
and Mr. Bennett's Angelotti was nota
ble.
Mr. Emanuel was in the leader's
chairâ one cannot get quite accustomed
to that (hairâ and proved himself again
able and experienced. The other "man
behind the gun. " the stage director.
Mi Evans, is entitled to high praise
for the smoothness of this and all the
productions. The climax of the second
act in particular showed his firm and
artistic hand. It was here that the
singers achieved a real Tivoli thrill,
and that the house rose bravely to it!

Tivoll.
"The Burgomaster" is being present
ed in fine style at the Tivoli, several
new artists having been specially en
gaged to aid the regular company in a
finished production of the piece. The
musical comedy abounds with pretty
music and humorous situations, found
ed as it is on the 200 years' sleep of
Peter Stuyvesant, ably Impersonated
by Willard Simms and Doodle, his sec
retary, as ably played by Teddy Webb.
The newcomers include Grace Palotta,
who has temporarily forsaken vaude
ville to contribute no small part to
the success of the comedy. She is
vivaciousness itself and could safely
add to her other accomplishments that
of a clever male impersonator. Al
bert Wallerstedt proved himself the
possessor of a fine voice, which showed
tn advantage in "I Drink from My
Heart to You." Minde4l Kingston, the
new soubrette, scored a big hit and
was highly pleasing in her dances and
cakewalk. Dora de Filipe was as good
as ever and earned a well-merited re
call for her singing of "I Love You,
Dear, and Only You." Too much can
not be said in praise of Aimee Leices
ter, who is always to be relied upon
in any part she undertakes. The re
turn of Ferris Hartman was the sig
nal for continued applause and he is
inimitable as the broken-down actor.
William Schuster essayed a new char
acter for himâ that of a heavyweight
pugilist, in which he was an artistic
as well as a physical success. Bessie
Tannehill had a congenial part and the
rest of the cast was well selected. The
scenery was pretty, notably the lawn
fete in the second act. The chorus
crirls wen- up to the mark and in their
bathing suits are worth going miles to
see. The male quartette rendered
"Dear Old College Days" in a pleas
ins manner.
Central.
A splendid production of Goethe's
masterpiece, "Faust," was given at the
Central last evening to one of the larg
est Monday night houses that the the
ater has ever had. From a point o-f
scenic beauty and general interest, this
wonderful drama has not lost any of
the absorbingly interesting features of
years ago. The staging was excellent
and artists and mechanics alike share
honors with the players for its tremen
dous success. Herschel Mayall Invest
ed the role of Mephisto with all the vi
rility that characterized his success in
the same part two years ago, and
showed marked improvement over that
impersonation. He presents a striking
figure in the garb of Satan, his voice
has a full, rich carrying power and he
contrived to get much good comedy out
of the lighter lines in the role. As Mar
guerite Juliet Crasbf did by far the
best bit of work that she has done in
several years and scored a most unique
hit. Her conception of the sweet, in
nocent girl was remarkably clever.
Henry Shumer, as Faust, astonished
his most ardent admirers by a rendi
tion that was marvelous. He has the
figure, stage presence and even pitched
notes so essential for a successful por
trayal of the part. George Webster, as
Valentine, is very good and most pleas
ing. Edna Ellsfnere, Julia Blanc and
Myrtle Vane were all good, as was
Millar Bacon and Walter Shannon, the
latter being well received in his singing
selection. It is doubtful if the amaz
ing Brocken scene has ever before had
such careful setting with such wonder
ful effect. During the revel of the fu
ries one was astounded at the myriad
of dragons, huge reptiles and other
weird creations which floated and
danced in mid-air in hordes. The del
uge of fire was realistic in every degree
and this one scene scored many en
cores. Such productions as "Faust"
have made the sensatio-n-loving public
gape in wonderment at the marvelous
effects that can be produced at the
Central.
Alcazar.
Edward E. Rose's dramatization of
"Alice of Old Vincennes" was enjoyed
last evening in the first presentation
of the Alcazar company by the usually
large attendance that greets the work
of the excellent stock company. With
in the last few weeks the company
has been materially strengthened by
the adidtion of some new timber, and
the result was seen in last night's
i clean-cut presentation of the roman
BUSINESS MEN
DISCUSS BRIDGE
Schwerin Speaks in Favor
of Causeway Traversing
the Carquinez Straits
MATTER IS REFERRED
President Newhall Appoints
Investigating Committee
of Five to Make Report
R. P. Schwerin addressed a meeting
of representatives of the commercial
bodies oi San Francisco yesterday
afternoon in tavor of permitting the
construction of a bridge across Car
quinez Straits, to be used by the South
ern Pacinc company lor the purpose
of shortening th- time and increasing
the facilities tor moving passengers
and lreigm in and out of ban Fran
cisco.
Mr. Schwerin said that he had been
strongly in tavor ever since he came
to San Francisco of bridging the pas
sage that is iiu\v crossed oy the ferry
boat Solano tor railroad purposes. He
aiso said that he appeared before the
representatives ot the commercial
bodies only as a citizen who was inter
ested in the prosperity of San Fran
cisco. He was interested in trans
pacific commerce, and everytning tnat
tended to properly .assemble treignts
ai this port so that steamships might
b. loaded in accordance with a proper
plan was of value to the commerce of
ihis port.
Incidentally Mr. Schwerin said that
the completion of the Salt Lake and
Los Angeles Railroad will, if present
conditions are not changed, make it
possible to ship freight to the Orient
cheaper by way of. Los Angeles than
via San Francisco.
Mr. Schwerin is chairman of a com
mittee of the Merchants' Exchange,
which includes as the other members
Percy T. Morgan, G. W. McNear. W.
M. Alexander and A. Chesebrough.
This committee recently made a re
port, which was in type and before the
mf-eting of yesterday in leaflets. The
tenor of the report was all in favor
cf the proposed Carquinez bride, to
be placed at or juat above Port Costa,
connecting the Port Costa side with
the Solano Bide.
It was held by the committee that
it is doubtful if the bridge will in any
way affect the height of the waters of
the Sacramento ami San Joaquin
rivers and that the bulk of business
foi the great commercial interests of
Baa Francisco, both passenger and
freight, has been and is suffering from
the enforced, detention and frequent
blockades between Port Costa and
Benicia, owing to the interruption to
the ferry between thesp points. Some
parts of the report are as follows:
POINTS IX THE REPORT.
: With a drawbridge with two openings of at
least"" 200 led Â«ach, "- placed about as outlined
on , the proposed â  plans, with long wings ex
tending., both up. and down the river from both
enÂ«la vi the draw, ; and with guiding bulkheads
extending each way from the drawbridge pier,
with 'a , tug 1 , to â be furnished by thp | Southern
Pacific, Company . constantly maintained â¢In
commission^ at the expense of. that company
for the bent-tit of all vessels desiring to pass
the â¢ draw ' and to be; furnished to . such vessels
free of charge, - and Â» with a proper 1 system of
buoys, ' lights and . tog â  signals as aids i to , navl-
Kaiion, indicating^ for some distance above and
below . ths draw â  the location â of ' the draw, the
commerce â of â the Straits of I Carqulnez ; will be
subject to a very, slight, if any. Inconvenience.
- \\e. believe that" the construction of this
bridge is of such- importance-; that the ques
tion "i mui-t not be "decided , by snap judgment,
but only after the V fullest Investigation and
mature consideration should any' opinion be
lornied. We would deplore any . action being
taken that would tend to ' condemn the : coil*
struction of this proposed -improvement, â  or
Â«ny other affecting the commercial interests of
Sun ' Francisco, accept -upon ' th; lines above
noted, for this is not a question" of I sentiment,
but of absolute tacts, which may in the future
seriously " aitcct the interests of San Francisco,
and a large part of the country contiguous
Uiaretc. â  >â "â¢ ' .' .â ' ... .. â -â  â  ,
It must be borne In mind that the con
struction of such bridges has been permitted
over the wauiways of all countries ot the
world, many of these waterways carrying a
in j< h vaster volume of traffic than will be
carnÂ»J through the Straits of Carquinez for
many years to come, and it Is a matter of
MtCt that j-teum and sail vessels traverse such
witters without ditiicuity yni! without delay.
l lie president of the Southern Pacific Com
pany has guaranteed to your committee that
it ins. bridge proposed, crossing the Slraits oi
(JartiUinez, vhoulo. cause v rise of a natural
level up stream, that It. will either be removed
hi rcplai ii with one of piers and spans, and
this it vould seem could be accepted ai a
BUtJfclent guarantee to protect the landowners
along the rivet against the question of high
water damage.
In conclusion, your committee strongly ad
vises that every means be taken to prevent
public opinion condemning this- bridge through
the efforts of the partisan, especially in view of
the fact that the question of the water level
Will soon be investigated by a corps of engi
neers -whose personality cannot but invite the
confidence of all, and whose opinion must be
considered as conclusive.
MEIU .'HANTS ASK QUESTIONS.
This report has not been adopted by
the Merchants' Exchange, but has been
submitted to the members of the ex
change for consideration. Mr.
Schwerin elaborated the arguments
contained in the report and answered
some questions. He had maps, a re
port made by Engineer Schussler of
the Spring Valley Water Works and
other data, which he submitted. Some
questions were asked by W. R.
Wheeler, Captain William Matson,
Rufus P. Jennings, George A. Newhall,
George W. Gray and C. H. Bentley.
After discussion, on motion of Rufus
P. Jennings, a committee of five was
appointed by President Newhall to
consider the report. This committee
consists of C. H. Bentley, W. H. Mars
ton, W. R. Wheeler, William Matson
and Rufus P. Jennings.
At the close of this discussion the
meeting listened to a statement by Ed
gar Painter, who read a letter from
the Postmaster General, in which it
was announced that the policy of the
Government will be to close the pres
ent postomce stations in the whole
sale sections of the city as distributing
stations as soon as the Postomce at
Seventh and Mission streets is opened.
No action was taken, but the matter
will be brought before the various
commercial bodies to consider.
tic play of revolutionary days. The
play was staged with that regard for
effect that is characteristic of the
management, and this is one of the
elements that go to make up the pop
ularity of that place of amusement.
Lillian Lawrence as Alice Rousillon
was in her best vein and exhibited the
varying moods of the heroine effec
tively and consistently. John Craig,
who is good in everything he attempts,
was well fitted to the part of John
Fitzhugh Beverly, and divided bis
well won honors in the applause with
the leading lady. The fun of the play
was contributed by Elizabeth Wood
son and Mary Young with a piquancy
that kept the audience laughing and
applauding. John Sainpolis, the Col
onel Hamilton of the cast, made a
strong personation. Father Beret, the
village priest, was in the hands of that
sterling actor John Davies. The
American flag, with forty-nine stars
or thereabouts, used in the play
should be shorn of a few stars. In
revolutionary times there ' were only
thirteen stars on the flag.

BOARD ADOPTS
ELECTRIC RATES
Supervisors Defer Action
on Bill Fixing the Maxi
mum Price Charged for Gas
PASS WATER ORDINANCE
Society for Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals Be
gins Impounding Dogs
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
deferred for one week the final pas
sage of the ordinance fixing the maxi
mum rate to be charged consumers for
gas at $1 per 1900 cubic feet. Super
visor Rock, the tenth member who
voted in favor of the ordinance, was
absent, owing to pressure of private
business. . Without his vote the ordi
nance would have failed of final pas
sag*. Supervisors Boxton. Gallagher,
I.unstedt and Sanderson voted against
postponement, which prevailed, how
ever, by twelve votes.
When the ordinance fixing the rates
for electricity came up for final pas
sage Attorney E. J. McCutchen urged
the board to fix a basic rate of 11 centj
per 1000 watt hours for electhcity, in
stead of 9 cents, as provided by the
ordinance. He said the 1 redaction
wculd cost the company 52200 per
month and prevent the extension of its
system in the outlying districts. Mc-
Cutchen asked that action on the
electric rates ,be deferred as well as
on ; the gas rate ordinance until next
Monday. The ordinance, however, was
finally passed by a unanimous vote and
fixes the maximum rate for electric
lights at 9 cents per 1000 watt hours,
subject -to discounts of from 5 per
cent to 40 per. cent when from 2000 to
9000 watt hours are burned monthly.
The rates for arc lights are fixed at
S3. S3. 12 25, $1 To and $1 40 per
according to the length of time
they are burned.
The ordinance fixing the rates to be
charged for water, which is a re-Â«a
actraent of the ordinance of last year,
now In litigation before the United
States court, was finally passed. ThÂ»
rate for hydrants is fixed at $1 each.
Supervisor Comte was the only one to
vote against the ordinance, he favor-
Ing the ordinance of 1903. which fixes
a rate for consumers 7 per cent higher
than that of 1904 and a rate of 13 for
hydrants.
