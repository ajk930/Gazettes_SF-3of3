PITTSBUP.G. Oct. 20.-Scandal treads
upon the heels of scandal following the
suicide of T. Lee Clarke and the closing
of the* Enterprise National Bank of Al

startling features developed to-day, al
though all persons Interested or impli
cated retuse to go into details. One sen
sation is that Mr. Clarke left a confession
giving in detail all his dealings with poli
ticians. The other. Is. that the Enterprise
Bank paid a commission of $100,000 to be
made the State depository. Who got the
commission has. not yet developed, but it
Is believed books will disclose the guilty
person or persons.
A telegram was sent to United States
Senator ; Boles Penrose . in Philadelphia
immediately after the bank dosed en
"Wednesday, imploring him to hasten to
Washington and to use all his. Influence
with national banking authorities to
prevent any knowledge of the payment
of commissions for use of State funds
becoming public. So far no reference. to
this payment of $100,000 has been made*
public by authority.
Frederick Gwlnner, president of the
bank, says he has , no knowledge of pay
ment of commissions.
\u25a0â¢j An Important conference held In Phila
delphia yesterday may hava some bearing
on this matter, although all , those pres
ent denied their visit: had any connection)
with; the affairs of the Enterprise Bank.

IX>NDOX. Oct. 20.â Beside that other
great actcr. Garrick, and under the shad
ow of the statue of Shakespeare, as th^e
Interpreter of whose plays he won fame,
the ashes of $ir Henry -Irvinff- were to
d,ay tjiven burial in Westminster Abbey,
thus being accorded England's greatest
tribute to her dead. â¢ â¢
The seivices, winch were of an ixnpres
eive character, were conducted in the
presence of a cpngregatior. which includ
od many .from the highest official life of
England, eminent representatives of all
vvaiKs of lite and all the representatives
of that gallery to which Irving was so
Invariably attentive, who could find
standing room in the Abbey. King Ed
ward was represented by General Sir
Dighton Probyn. . keeper of the privy
purse, and the Prince of Wales was rep
resented by Lieutenant Golonel Carring
tun, comptroller of tue Prince's house
hold, while the Cabinet Ministers and
ilraLassadors attended in person. White
law Reid, who is visiting: In Scotland,
came to London purposely to testify to
America's regard for the dead tragedian.
The services, although short and simple,
were most impressive. As the mourners
errived, Sir. Frederick B. Ridge, the or
ganist of Westminster Abbey, played
Chopin's funtral march, io.iowed by
PurctU's iuneral music, rendered with
l! umpets and trombones. Then came
Schubert's "March Solenneile."
Sharply at noon the procession started
from the Chapel of St. .Faith, where the
casket containing the ashes had lain over
night, and l-absed through the cioisters
to tht sivace between the choir and the
sanctuary, where the casket, covered
with the pall of laurel wreaths, was
placed on a catafalque. During the pro
cession the cfiotr sang the hymn "Brief
lite Is Here Our Portion." Then foi
lowed the psalm "Loro, Thou Hast Been
Our litfust." L<tÂ«son was read by Canon
Duckworth, the substitute dean of West
mnistcr, who was assisted in the service
by liishcrp Weiden. Archueacon Wilber
loice and Canon Hensley Henson. The
anthems were "Crossing The Bar" and
"Wttp Ye Not For The Dead."
After the anthems the casket was
borne to .the grave as the organ pealed

When Executive's .Train Arrives

Home- and Wins the Southerners.
ATLANTA, Oct. 20.â The President's i
visit to Atlanta to-day was a marked
event in the history of the State -of Geor
gia. â¢He was greeted on hi^ arrival by
her most distinguished citizens and
throughout the day on every hand r were
shouted words, of welcome, that,". left no,
room for .doubt; of .their sincerity. ...The, r
city was i'rj,Jg;ala attire. find :buslj)es^,>-a9;

Carolina, in the person of Governor' Hjfey^
ward, added its .welcome to.t he South. . ll
The threatening clouds of the early,
morning failed to loose their weight,, of
rain and although a chilling wind pre
vailed through . the entire day It failed,
to cool the ardor of the. welcome. ' . .',
Numerous extra trains brought* their,
burden of Georgians from, the. surround"-;
ing country, and It was estimated that'
not less than 100,000 persons saw and",
welcomed the President.. .. -.;.'.-.'.
The Presidential train came into ;.the.
handsome new station exactly .on. time,
and as it appeared threading its way]
through the maze of tracks in the yards
it was given a noisy welcome by .all the
steam whistles in that. part of the city.
The demonstration increased in volume
as the train came to a stop. Waiting -to
receive the President was the committee
headed by Governor Terrell and composed
of Senator A. S. Clay, Congressman Ldv
ingston. Mayor J. G. Woodward and
Bishop C. K. Nelson, of the Episcopal
Diocese of Georgia- A committee of la
dies headed by Mrs. Terrell and Mrs.
Clark Howell was in readiness to receive
Mrs. Roosevelt.
GREET THE PRESIDENT.
As th-i traio stepped Governor Terrell
and Senator Clay, accompanied by Mrs.
Terrell and Mrs. Howell. stepped aboard
and greeted the President and Mrs.
Roosevelt. A moment later the party
emerged and introductions followed. Mrs.
Roosevelt and her parly .^departed al
most immediately for the ; -Governor's
mansion, while the Presid^at. and party
were escorted to carriages .In waiting
back of the station. The line of march
was quickly formed and the President and
his escort started for . Piedmont Park,
where the State Fair Is being held. ...
The distance from the station to the
park is about three miles, .and through
out the entire router, which ran along
historic Pcachtree street, crowds lined the
sidewalk and give the -President round
after round of cheers, which. the execu
tive smilingly acknowledged, hat in hand.
It was a few minutes past 11 when, the
President reached the park, and again he
was greeted by the noise of steam .whis
tles from all the engines In the Fair
Grounds and by the cheers of many thou
sands who were waiting his arrival. After
a review of the Seventeenth. Infantry,
\u25a0which had recently returned to Fort Mc-
Pherson from tjbe Philippines., the. Presir
dent delivered "his address. .President.
Hughes of .they Fair; AjE^atlon..intro

rose to speak, the ,throj>g r cheered him
heartily and waved their hats;-\Uribrel
las and handkerchiefs. .He sald^;'."' " V. V
Prerident Roosevelt began by saying that
the oroblems Americans have to face to-day,
are very serious, but after all they 'are only
part of the Drice ther have to pay.; for -tbÂ©
triumphs the}- have. won. -for- the \u25a0 nigh ..posi
tion they have attained.. He, cautioned them
against displaying a foqllsh opt|mrÃm. wit
warned them " also " to' "toeu-are Of- tfrittitojr into
biind DesEimism in their- views of. ? the ruture,-
In this connection the President: said: - .
"Undoubtedly the growth of wealth in this
country has had some very unfortunate ac
companiments, but it seems to me that much
the worst damage that people of wealth can do
the rest of us ia not any actual physical harm,
but the awakening In our breasts of either
the mean vice of worshiping mere wealth,
and the man of mere wealth, for the wealths
take, or the equally mean vice of viewing
with rancorous envy and \u25a0 hatred the . men
of wealth merely, because they, are men of
wealth." â
In referring to the question of Government
supervision of the great corporations the Presi
dent characterized them as "the most efficient
business Implements." and further said: \u25a0
â¢The corporation is the creature of the.
StatÂ« It should always- be held .accountable
to some sovereign, and -this accountability
should be real and not sham. Therefore, in
niy Judgment, all corporations doing an Inter
state business, and this means the great ma
jority of the largest corporations, should be
held accountable : .to the Federal Government,
because their accountability should be co-ex
tensive -with their field of action.' But most
certainly we should not Jttrlve to Drevent-or
limit corporate activity. We should strive to
secure such effective supervision over It. Bitch
power of regulation over it, as to enable us
to guarantee that its activity . will be exer
cised only in ways beneficial, to the, public.
PROVE TOO ZEALOUS.
'The unwisdom of any well-rr.eanlng but mis
guided eCort to check corporate activity has
been shown in striking fashion In recent years
by our experience in the Philippines - and In
Porto Rico. Our national legislators very
properly determined - that the Islands' shpujd
not be -exploited by adventurers without're
srard to the Interests of the people . of the
islands the'roselvee. But" unfortunately 'ln their
zeal to prevent the islands from beinc Im
properly exploited they took measures -of s^ch;
severity ac to seriously and in ' some respects,
vitally to hamper and retard the development
of the islands." "''-.. . -'.
â¢ The â¢ President saJd that recent, revelations'
u>f thejroanner in which some of. the great for-;
tunes have been obtained had caused the con
>clence of the people to be '-deeply 'shocked.' He!
.hoped that a good deal could, toe-done by. law.
-to remedy-'this, ctate of things, but , when tliat>
was done there would yet remain- tnuch/<r&t'
could only be reached by the force of 'public. 1
ci'lnlon. < '\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0 â¢ 'â¢" â¢;-" :
The President then told his audience that
the South'* great stapleâcottonâ had ~ caused
the balance of trade to be turned in favor
'of the United 9lates last year.---. The Â»tate- :
ment that China afforded the largest market
for American cotton carried him -to. the sub
ject of the boycott of our goods tn China. Con-:
cernlng this, the President, salds . *, %
KEEP OUT COOWES.' _ V
"This Government Is doing, and- will'con
tinue to do. ail it can to-put a stop to. the
boycott. But there Is' one measure , to betaken

The chief cause In bringing about* the boy
cott cf our goods in China., was undoubtedly
Our attitude toward the Chinese who come to
this country. This attitude of ours, does not
Justify the action of the Chinese in the boy
cott, and especially sorae' of the forms which
that action >ias taken. ' Hut the fact remains
that in the past we 'have* come srtort of our
duty. toward the people of China. 'If Is. our
clsar duty, in the Interest of our own- wage

from coming' here.' The. greatest" of all. duties
is national selX-preservatioa and the-most.lm

to preserve in every way. the being of the
wage workers. ..I am convinced thnt the .welt

clusion cf the Chinese' cool ies, and It is there
fore our duty to exclude them. But we should
not only operate the law. with aÂ»-little'harsh
ness as possible, but 'we should .snow every
courtesy and consideration and every encour-'
agement to all Chinese who are not of the la
boring class to come to this country. Our laws'

WOMAN SEEKS WORK
IN MALE ATTIRE
Arrested in Man ? s Garb She
Tells a Story of
Hardship.
CHICAGO. Oct. 20.â Attired in mascu
line garb. Augusta Helxfiy. a young mar
ried woman/ sought work for four days
In the "downtown district, mingling with
scores of rival male applicants and pass
ing unobserved in the throngs on the
ma.in streets. To-day she would have be
gun.work as a male waiter in a down
town restaurant had not an observant
pollctman last night noted a characteris
tically feminine move and manner in the
youth. The policeman took the "suspect"
to the police station, where the young
worr.an admitted her disguise and de
clared that she had adopted the garb
solely in order that she might obtain em
ployment In which living wages could be
obtained. In SL Louis she had worked
es c waitress and had been able to earn
barely a scant living, while her clothing
had been worn to shreds. Unable to re
plenish it, she had taken from a trunk
a suit of clothing once worn by her hus
band and determined that she would pass
as a man.
The woman is 26 years of age and re
sides in Fairbury. Neb. "When little more
than a girl she came to Chicago. She
was thrown upon her own resources and
learnt that it was difficult for a woman
to earn a good livelihood.
A speeding automobile was the cause of
the failure of Miss Helvey's plans. As it
Cashed by a downtown corner a police
man leaned forward to catch the number.
The woman, in coat and trousers, was in
Its path. She shrieked ~as she leaped
aside into a mud puddle and made a mo
tion as If to gather up her ekirts. Then
this youth moved a hand to his hat as
If to edjust It.

SOME OF THE ABLE AND ENTSRGETIC DELEGATES TO THE CALIFORNIA I
EQUAL SUFFRAGE CONVENTION WHICH 'BEGAN ITS SESSIONS YESTER
DAY IN WHEELER'S AUDITORIUM ON S UTTER STREET. |
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
It Is 'a confession of senility to rail
against religion because a minister, goes
wrong, or because he preaches a fool
sermon; just so Is it imbecile to sneer
at equal suffrage because ,the suffrage
convention In Wheeler's Auditorium yes
terday was a bore, and because some of
the exponents of the cause made-- tire
some and pointless speeches.
The morning session began with- a
prayer by the Rev. Bradford Leavittâ
such a prayer as could issue only from
a spiritual and sensitive mind.
Following him Mrs. Mary S. Sperry,
State president of the California Equal
Suffrage Association, greeted the conven
tion in charming manner, bearing to the
workers tidings of progress.
The usual tedious, but apparently neces
sary, reports were read â those of Mrs.
Alice L. Park, acting secretary, Mrs. H.
J. D. Chapman, corresponding secretary,
followed by the reports of counties, as
follows : 7 x T C. "
Alameda, ' Mrs. Frances A. 'Williamson;
Los Angeles. Mrs. Bertha M. Baruch;
Santa Clara, Mrs. Frances G. Rosebrook;
San Francisco, Dr. >lida C. Avery.
These reports filled the morning hours,
and recess was taken until 2:30, :when
the following programme was put
through: Invocation, Mrs. Georgb W.
Haight; greetings, Mrs. Mary W. Swift
and Mrs, Agnes C. Moody; address,- Mrs.
Mary -S.- Sperry, president; reminiscences,
Mrs. Ellen C. Sargent; "Susan B. An
thony," Mrs. I. A. Baldwin; "When
Women Vote," Mrs. Julia Sanborn; reci
tation, "Sacajawea," Mrs. Julia Churchy
ill; '.'A New Vocation for Women," Dr.'
Minora Kibbe.
Mrs. Sperry and Mrs. Sargent presented
many logical and Irrefutable arguments
: in support of, women's' demand 1 ; for suf
frage, while Mrs. John F. Swift related
some relevant news of the International
Council of Women held in Berlins last
summer. But there was a woeful lack of
gingerâ of vitality, of modern, organized
methods of thought and expressionâ ln
the general discussion.. lt was lamentably
tame and, but for the points scored . by
the venerable leaders, Mrs. Sargent' and
Mrs. Sperry, the session . , was uncon
vincing and barren. . ' -/ ./ â¢
The evening session opened well, with
Lorena Elizabeth Hoag in "The Widder
Doodle"â as. clever an Impersonation as
any seen in' "Mrs. Wiggs."
Mrs. Anna K. Bidwell followed in "The
Outlook in Oregon," which by the way,
bids fare to be- the fifth "free" State in
the Unionâ if California doesn't watch- out.
The Rev. C. Calvert Smoot, of Â» the Second
Unitarian Churchâ the sole^ man on the
programmeâ saved the session by.his ad
dress on".Woman's Share." ~ And It . was
distinctly not a; mattery of/, sex.,- that, he
held the interest, but because \u25a0he J had
prepared his talk with care, gave it-with
out gluing his eyes to his paper, and be-

cause he has a pleasing voice and an
agreeable personality. These are essen
tial to success in any public crusade, and
it is unfortunate for any cause when
poorly equipped speakers are put forth
to elucidate or strengthen itâ for the re
sults are unfortunate. There is â¢' much
good work to be done by -..'enthusiasts in
other lines, leaving the* Epeaking to be
done by those equipped for it. V
To-day, however, a really live pro
gramme is announced, when Mrs. Horace
Coffin, one of the. younger! exponents of
the cause of "Eaual rights to all, arid
special privileges to none" will read a
modern paperâ this in the morning ses
sion.
*. The afternoon programme likewise of
fers many' good thingsâ so drop in \lf

Xhe logic, though a little verbose, may
awaken a new line of thought to you.

. CHICAGO, Oct. 20.â The storm which
lastnight and to-day swept over North

In recent' years. . :
As far as returns are obtainable to
night eleven vessels have been com
pletely wrecked and twelve to fifteen
others were more or less severely dam
aged. Twelve lives * are known to have
been lost, 'and as the gale on Southern
Lake Huron and Lake Krie is still blow
ing fiercely.... to-night, -..it 'is feared that
other losses, both of life and property,
willbe reported within- the next twenty
four hours. The boats wrecked are as
follows:' - . y"

Tug Walter Metcair, sunk near Breakwater
Light, Cleveland.
The Minnedosa. 'on' which, so far as.
known, the greatest loss of life occurred,
was coming down from Fort William,
Canada, bound for some Lake Ontario
port, with ' a cargo of wheat. She was
in tow of the steamer Westmount, which
was also towing the barge Melrose. The
tow lines broke during the storm and the
Melrose and Westmount were separated
from the Minnedosa. They managed to
make shelter at Harbor Beach late in
the afternoon and reported that they had
seen the Minnedosa go down. She was in
command of Captain Phillips, who had
his wife aboard. The names of the other
members of the crew are not known. The
boat was owned by the Montreal Trans
portation Company of Montreal.
The gale created such a sea as has not
been experienced by sailors on the lake&
in the . last fifteen years. Many of thÂ«
lai ge steam barges , which \ make nothing
of the usual heavy, seas prevalent at this
time of the year, were compelled to seek
shelter in the nearest ports.' :

BUFFALO, Oct. 20.â A gale reaching
seventy-two. miles an hour at Its greatest
velocity swept over Buffalo and Western
New York from early this morning until
late to-night. Much property was de
stroyed and at least one person was
killed. Lake Erie, lashed into a fury by
the tremendous blow, played havoc with
shipping. â¢
The schooner Mautenee, . light, bound
from Buffalo to Duluth, foundered off
Ripley, twenty miles west of Dunkirk, at
4:30 this afternoon. Captain Morgan and
the crew were saved. The Mautenee
probably will go to pieces during the
night. - >;
Dunkirk fishermen report that an un
known barge is in distress off Van Buren
Point, ten miles west of Dunkirk, but the
story cannot be confirmed.
Captain Ohman and. Seaman Gus Par
sons of the barge Unadilla were swept
overboard with a deck' load of lumber.
They clung to the floating timbers until
rescued. . 7
Mrs. Catherine Yeager, 54 years old,
was crushed to death, beneath a brick
wall blown . down by the wind.

Every graft-despising and law-respecting citizen of San Francisco entertains the hope and belief that the Supreme Court of California, appealed to at' Los Angeles 'yesterday by counsel for the Republican and democratic parties,
will compel the lawless Board of Election Commissioners of this city to respect the- law. The court yesterday issued a Writ of mandate, returnable next Thursday, restraining the Commissioners from placing Schmitz s name on the official
ballot as the nominee for Mayor of Independent Republicans and nominee of Independent Democrats. The Board of Commissioners last night directed that such designation shoulid be made on the ballot.

of law and riffbt Â«aÂ« anticipated by tbe leaders of tbe fusion campaign
committee.
In line v> ith that anticipation, E. F. TreadvÂ«ell, attorney, representing
tbe Republican and Democratic parties, went to Loa Angeles Thursday
evening and yesterday petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ to restrain
the board from committing the unlawful act. The writ was granted by the
<xÂ»urt and made returnable In this city next Thursday.

LOS ANGELES. Oct. 20.â The Supreme
Court of California took a hand in the
San Francisco municipal campaign to
day and upon the final result of proceed
ings instituted by San Francisco attor
neys will depend the fate or at least two
of the tickets now jn the field. The ac
tion of the court thus far is only prelim
inary and is, so far as the final result
is concerned, not at all Indicative of
what the final action of the court may
be.
Attorney Treadwell appeared before the
Supreme Court this afternoon and made
formal application for a writ restraining
the Election Commissioners of San Fran
cisco from putting theV.ames of the so
called Independent Republican and In
dependent Democratic candidates on the
ticket to be voted at the municipal elec
tion. There was no argument. The at
torney simply filed the formal applica
tion in which it is set forth that the Elec
tion Commissioners are about to place
those names on the ticket and that such
proceeding would be illegal and for the
purpose cf preventing a full and free ex
pression by the voters at the polls. Other
allegations of similar import are made,
the petition closing with a plea that said
Election Commissioners be restrained
from taking the contemplated action.
The matter was not contested and the
court, after a cursory examination of the
papers^ announced that an alternative
writ would issue, returnable in San Fran
cisco Thursday, October 26.
Justices McFarland and Lorigan were
asked to-night upon what grounds the
writ was petitioned foX Replying for
both. Justice McFarland said:
"The members of the court did not ex
amine into the matter at aIL W e do not
know who tue. lndependent Republicans
or Independent Democrats are and did
not inquire, although some of us had a
natural curiosity to know just what turn
was io be taken in the San Francisco
municipal fight. We will hear the case on
Thursday next and not until then Will it
be possible fur us to know much about
Attorney Treadwell left on the Owl at
" o'clock for San Francisco.
GET PLACES O.V BALLOT.
The Ruef Board of Election Commis
sioners decided last night to admit the
Independent Republican and Democratic
parties to a place on the ballot This
proceeding was hurriedly put through by
the board to forettall the writ of pro
hibition granted by the Supreme Court
of the State. The commissioners, espe
cially VoorÃanger and Lenlngwell. couldv
not refrain from showisg their spite
aeainet Perry Newberry. representative
of the Republican League. The pair were
loud in their denunciation of the inde
pendent press.
In placing the so-called Independent Re
publican and Democratic tickets upon the
ballot the board act<?a in nervous haste.
As soon as the minutes of the previous
meeting were rattled off President De
voto said:
"I understand that the Independent Re
publican and Democratic parties have pe
titions signed by more than three per'
cent of the voters of the city and county
and therefore are entitled to be placed on
The ballot. I have heard that the Su
preme Court has issued an alternative
writ of mandate returnable at 10 o'clock
next Thursday, but we have not been
officially notified of the fact.
"I move that the petitions of the In
dependent Republican and Democratic
parties be filed and given a place on the
ballot," said Commissioner Lef&ngwell.
"I believe that they have been made
within the. requirement of the law," in
terposed Devoto. "The words Independ
ent Republican and Independent Demo
cratic are not likeiy to mislead voters,
as has been alleged. In reference to the
other proposition advanced by Attorney
Treadwell I will cay that three per cent
of the voters having signed the petition I
that his motion is overruled."
It was then suggested that it would "be
more regular" to vote on the different
parties teparately. Commissioner Lemng
well moved first that the Independent
Republicans be placed upon the ballot
and Immediately afterward that the in
dependent Democrats also be given a
place. Both motions were quickly sec
onded and carried by Ruefs board. 1
During the investigation of the case of
Jacob Charles Dunbach. charged with
being fraudulently registered. Commis
sioner Devoto openly declared himself an
enemy of civil service. "Blame the civil
service clerks for the mistake," he said.
â¢'There have been frequent complaints
ag-ainst the civil service clerks."
A warrant had been sworn to against
Dunbach charging him with fraudulent
registration. Dunbach declared that hÂ« j
had been living at 1547 Lombard street for |
over two months. He was entered on the j
register as residing at ISI7 Lombard I
street.
Commissioner Leffingwell asked New- Â»
berry in an insolent manner if he cared
to apologize to Dunbach. Xewberry re
torted: "It Is the mistage of one of your
clerks. I am not responsible." j
This reply brought forth the bitter de
nunclation of civil service from Cammis- !
sioner Devoto, president of the board. j
J. T. Maloney of 537 Mission street also'
declared that he had gained a residence
in the district in which he was registered.
"This is some more rotten politics on
the part of the Republican League." de
clared Lefflngrwell. "This is some more
of the work of the official persecutor."
A crowd of rusty looking applicants for
positions as election officers smiled at
Leffingwell's sally and the faithful agent
of Ruef looked pleased with himself. All
through the meeting LefHngwell and De
voto attempted in a weax and fatuous
way to roast the Republican League and
to annoy Mr. Xewberry. Their efforts
were seconded by the hungry looking ap
plicants.
When Mahoney's case was called the
facetous Lefflngwell asked 'his landlord,
J. Fisler, if Mahoney was a stuff er.
"For why is a stuffer?" asked Mr.
Fisler blankly. "I don't know vas Is a
stuffer."
Frank C. Jordan, local agent for the
United States Standard Voting Machine,
declared that it would be impossible to
tirnp3r with th? machines. Jor an fald
that the general agent uf the company
was on the way from the East. On his
arrival a public demonstration will be
given to prove that the machines cannot
be doctored.
"I understand that you have a stand
ing offer of $1000 for 'anybody who can
manipulate cne of the machines," said
Commissioner Lefflngwell. "Is that so?"
"I don't know where I could raise the
$1000, though," said Jordan.
Jordan was . also very bitter in his
denunciation of 'the newspapers.
Attorney A. S. Newburgh, one of Ruefs
retainers, was at the . meeting as the rep
resentative of the Independent Repub
lican party. He was referred to fre
quently on law points by^ the Ruef com
mission. '
Attorney Keough, representing whole
sale liquor dealers who are interested In
defeating the high license ordinance, tried
to find out whether the commissioners
would have the words "ires" and "No"
or "For" and "Against" the license on
the ballot." Keough orated for nearly half
an hour. The commissioners became per
plexed and put the matter over until next
Tuesday.
I. W. Hellman Jr., who was cited to
appear to show cause why he did not
serve as an election officer when sum
moned, declared that he was at Lake
Tahoe for his health when the notice was
served upon him. He declared that he
had no desire to show contempt. The
case was dismissed.
The case of Laurancfe Scott was con
tinued until the next meeting.
CLAIMS AGENT
HELD HER BABE
Mrs. William Gillman reported to the
police last night that her tiny -aby was
being held In a Post-street loaging-house
for the non-payment of a $50 installment
on the purchase price of the place and
that the owners refused. to give up the
child until the money was paid. Officer
William Isaacs accompanied the woman
to the address, 242 Post street/ and there
he regained the babe, which was readily
passed out throug-h the wlna; â¢?.'.
Mrs. Gillman asserts that she had
recently purchased the lodging-house
and that she was to take possession
yesterday. She says that she had paid
$500 cash and was to pay the rest in

leges, but could not pay the money.
She asserts that . F. J. Spaulding,- a
locÂ»l real estate man, refused to give

police to have both possession and the
babe given her.
Mrs. Gill man asserts that she was de
ceived in the transaction. 'She says
that furniture was taken out and fake
roomers were introduced to her. She
asserts that she will swear out a war

SCHMITZ LOSING GROUND
IN THE THIRTY-THIRD
tw& M EÂ§ii NG S AID FU S I ON
Ticket Gains Supporters at Bernal
Heights and at Ocean View.
One of the most significant meetings
of the -campaign was held last night at
Wackenruder's Hall on Bernal Heights
in the Thirty-third district. The building
was crowded to the doors with voters
-eager to listen to John S, "' Partridge.
Never before in * the .two < Schmitz cam
paigns have leaders of the opposition force
been able to gather an audience in that
> section of the district, as it is ; prover
bial that the "gang" is well able to break
up any meeting. Last night the tradi
tion was shattered and as" a fitting cli
max to the cheers and greetings of the
crowd, Mr. Partridge was detained .on
the platform several ' minutes by-voters
who crowded about him to shake' his
hand.
Partridge, whose .home district, the
Thirty-first, once embraced \Jhat section
of the Thirty-third, was greeted - fre
quently by the, name of John fr.om dif
ferent portions of the house. He opened
his speech with a reference to his as
sociation in the Thirty-third and told
them of the outrages aÂ»id attacks made
on him at Garibaldi Hall. He compli
mented the police of the district on the
efficient order maintained and denounced
as a lie that he was going to deprive the
force of its holidays. He spoke in part as
follows: i . \u25a0-.
The people of \u25a0 this district are to \u25a0 be con
gratulated upon its remarkable growth. The
improvsment h*re has been ot tha healthiest
kindâ the butldinr of numerous small homes
by peipons who own or are paying for their
own land. Naturally, you are all interested
in Improvements, the building of new schools,
the betterment of ths streets and sewer syH
tem. more and better lights, and Improved
transportation facilities. The issue of this
campaignâ ln which you are most interested â
aside from the hatred for graft and dishonesty
which I know you must all reelâ is the failure
to sell the bonds, which is directly traceable
to distrust of the present administration. Bonds
to the amount of over $17,000,000 have been
voted of which $7,250,000 is for sewers, $3,
505.000 for schools and *1,621,000 for streets.
This money should have been available a long
time ato. The street work should be all
under way long before this.. The sewer system
should be in course of construction. But theÂ»Â«
bonds cannot be sold - because financiers arÂ«
afraid of the administration. < Some of the
school bonds have been sold, but the school
houses have not been eonsfcrjiete,d,,,~..
Now there is no doubt ln'the'wrlS that with
a decent administration financiers would readi
ly purchase these bonds. Then -this immense
sum of. " money would be " expected, \u25a0, the city,
would be improved, property-, values would go
up, and an immense pumber of -laboring men
would be employed. Carpenters,- bricklayers,
housesmlths, lathers and plasterers,, in fact
every; kind of, labor would fjnd profitable em
ployment.
But even If the bonds are sold, experience
has shown that the present administration can
not be trusted to expend the money properly.
It is. a favorite trick of corrupt politicians,
when large public Improvements are .to be
made, to form contracting companies, and di
vert the major portion of the money Into their
own purses.
I tell you. the only labor l&atie in this cam
paign is whether the money from the bonds
shull go into the pockets of the worklngmen
or into the bank account of the grafters.
Prior to Mr. Partridge's arrival Henry
U. Bandenstein addressed the meeting
and told some truths about â¢ Ruef and
his administration.- He * also read his
denial of the false -charges' njade recent
ly by P. H. McCarthy, as follows;
A malicious lie about me that has been cir
culated industriously during this campaign can
be checked only In one .way. and that is by
the presentation of the facts out of which the
charge .\u25a0 arises. ' â¢ â¢ -^ V
An application was made to- the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors , about
a ytar ago by representatives! or the American
Ftderation of Labor to Sight the City Hall
dome for five nights during the session of that
federation in this city, and to erect decorative
flag poles on Market- street.. . - - / ~
It wa> believed at the time that these flags
were in the possession of the Board of Public
Works, and that they were suf licient in num
ber for the purpose intended.. Such flags as
the city owned were placed upon -the poles by
the executive department, either the Board of
Public Works or the \ Department of Elec
tricity." All this wag done In consultation m with
Mr. Casey, who appeared at the time before
the Finance Committee, representing the
American Federation of Labor.
It was subsequent^ discovered that the city
did not own as many flags as was believed â
the flags thought to be in possession of the
"city could not be located. . No appropriation
had been made for the purchase of additional
flags, and no application was ever made to the
Board of Supervisors or the Finance Commit
tee for such appropriation. An application
was recently made for the purchase . of flags
to decorate the flag poles during the last La- .
bor day celebration, and, ths ! Finance Commit
tee, acting upon that application, made a spe
cific appropriation .for the . purchase of those
flars.^ iâ¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0- \u25a0 '-\u25a0â¢ : â¢\u25a0.*\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.. -\u25a0 ..' . \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
The statement of Mr. McCarthy that "the
few dollars' it would cost to put the flags on
the_ poles, Mr. Brandenstein - â¢ \ * '.'â¢ - rofusfd
to allow, for, forsooth, Mr. George, told him he
i did not want it done" la founded on . nothing
i but the , Imagination nf Mr. McCarthy.
I These are the aqtual facts of the case, which
i are presented -to the, puolic , In Justice to the
j other member* of the Finance Committee, and
to myfslf.

T. R. Huling. Among the first speakers )
introduced by him were Fred N. Bent,
O. C. ' Pratt, i Percy- "V. Long, Ed. :R.. Rock
and Oscar Hocks,: \u25a0\u25a0' \u25a0 - .">
Second only to Partridge in the warmth
of welcome was Peter J. Curtis, candidate
for re-election as Sheriff. Curtis told of
the importance^ and irksome duties per-,
taining to \the Sheriff's ofÃce and said
that it gave but little opportunity to
make friends. He added that he had al
ready been tried, and found loyal and
promised that If re-elected he would do"
his duty and treat all alike. Curtis left
the hall before the meeting' ended'-;* and
was cheered as he passed down the aisle.
WOLF'S HALL CROWDED.
Voters of Thlrty-TlUrd District Greet
Partridare at Ocean View. :
The only fault with the meeting last
riight "at., Wolfs Hall in the Thirty
third District at Ocean View' was that
the hall was not- large enough to hold
the residents of the district who gath-j
ered to hear John S. Partridge.
The presiding officer of the : meeting
was*' Louis Ferrari. T He reviewed^ the
reason for casting: aside of; all' party
favoritism' for the welfare 1 of the; city,
and said the issue of , the campaign .was
honest men- against corruption in- pub-i
lie" life. He Fef erred toUheactions* of
the present administration as: an; insult
to labor and .pointed Fout; the absence
of labormen on.the Ruef iticket. . : ;,
Percy -. y./ Long, the ' candidate # f or
City,. ' Attorney- reviewed the" hlstoryvot
the ; bond issues ; and the f ailu re "-. of .the
administration 'to - ppurt r idle 'money J .-'to
use/ in J bettering - the [city. . 'Â£ He com
pared, the'slow progress; of ': San Frah
jclsco. during the. last '.'two 1 - years',, with
other cities of the Pacific Coast and
deplored the action of the various de
partments in obeying Ruef 's orders . in
stead of protecting the interests of the
people. .In closing he referred to the
rowdyism at .the recent conventions
and at the fusion meeting at Garibaldi
Hall Thursday night. â¢
When John S. Partridge entered the
hall tie was warmly greeted and spoke
in ''part as follows;
You i have \ doubtle%n all read Tn thÂ« papers
the account of Dr. Dillon's speech in Pioneer
Hall. Hew he told that when he. was Health
Officer under the present administration '\u25a0 he
saw a. quantity of beef infected with the dread
disease consumption. How- he tried to" stop
the sajÂ« of this mfat, and was not permitted
to do co by the employes of the'administra
tion. I want, to" call your attention to the
fact 'that when the nresent Board of Health
took orrire in January, lÂ»(Xi. they abolished
the department of food inspection because the
employes of that department werÂ« under civil
service. \u25a0
Now l want to repeat to you what I Â»aW
last nljrht. that the health and lives of the
people must not be trifled with any longer.
We muÂ»t have an absolutely; fair and un
biased Board of Health, a board which will
be absolutely above suupicion. that will be
free from any political affiliations whatsoever,
that will make appointments only in accord
ance with the civil Borvice provisions of the
charter, and will seÂ« to It that these em
ployes do their duty fairly and honestly.
The spoils system ia evil anywhere, but
In the* Board of Health It does the devil's
work... â¢ â¢'. *.. - : - . .
This department .of the. government can only
be, made what it should be by physician* of
the very highest type. \u25a0 I repeat again, that 1f
I am elected I shall Invite Into consultation
the leading physicians of San Francisco find
make the appointments absolutely under their
advice. â¢> ...,..-
\u25a0 It !o an evil thing indeed that the Board
of Health should be the most active and per
sistent In its assaults upon the civil service.
We thought, when the new charter was adopt
ed, that we had done away with the pdolls
syetem forever. But it was a vain hope. With
out an efficient, civil service how can ' we ever
hope to make a success of municipal owner
ship? When the civil service employes pf thÂ»
Board of Health were discharged they were
told "it's a turn of the political'' Syheel."
. Supposing the Geary-street road Is actually
built and conductors and motormen employed.
Are they . to be told, whenever the adminis
tration changes, "It's a turn of the political
wheel".?. I tell you no public utility can be
carried on with any hope of success unless*
the employes, are mire, of thHr; positions during'
good behavior. The present administration haS
bent every energy to destroying civil service.
If I am elected, I promise you. I shall be just
as active Jjv \jnholdlnr tt. ' " -

KILLS WOMAN,
THEN DIES BY
OWN HAND
Shortly before midnight a. double trag
edy occurred in the. rear apartment of a
house at 336 Eddy street in which Mrs.
Lillian Nessler, otherwise . known as
Lillian Daly, was shot and killed by
Geoige Lee, a laborer, who afterward
took his own life. One woman witnessed
the murder and suicide, but she disap
peared a moment after tne shots were
fired and the police have thus far been
unable to ascertain what caused the
trouu.e.
Mrs. Nessler had '*â¢ been living at the
Eddy street address for the past month.
When she first 'came to tho premises she
gave the name of Daly and was accom
panied by Miss Daisy Newhard, who
now resides at 239 Page street. The two
women frequented several resorts about
town and it was due (to this fact that
she was identified. Mrs. Nessler hesi
tatqdr about becoming acaualnted with
the other occupants of the house, and be
yond the fact that she often entertained
strangers nothing was known of her.
Last night Lee entered unseen:' by the.
other roomers. V
\u25a0 Just what trouble i occurred cannot be
taid, but it was nearly.' midnight when
three shots were heard and a woman,
known as Mrs. Price, who. had been: car
ing for her during a recent illness, rushed
from the rear of the house exclaiming:
"My God! My girl is shot.". When Po
licemen Fiynn and Thompson and Detec
tive Ray _il va entered '\u25a0: the â¢\u25a0 place Mrs.
Ntssler wjas found dead on a. lounge .with
two bullet holes in her head, and Lee
lay on the floor, the revolver still in his
grasp and blood gushing from a' wound
in the head. Lee had been -living with
the woman for. about one week. -V
Mrs- Nessler evidently .-feared the
man who shot -her.''. Several days ago
she .left a \u25a0 note ; pinned to the j door | re
questing- Miss Newhard to knock | three
times, when she should call. -,that she
might know who desired to see her.,'
\u25a0 Mrs. Nessler was separated .from her
husband, Fred Nessler, some time ago!
Thfe latter; was badly, injured ; in' ' an

IGNORES 'PROVISION -01 "PENAL CODE
While endeavoring to stuff, the booths,
at the coming 'election .with pro-Schmltz
officers, the r administration's Board" of
Election Commissioners, has laid itself
open to prosecution on, a qharge,of felony.
Thia fact came to' light" during. the prog
ress of the hearing ; before Â£ Judge . Slqss
of the application of Perry H, Newberry,
representing the Republican Leagua,Â»for
a writ of mandate 'to compel 'the Election,
Commission to submit .for his inspection*

\u25a0 When.the case was* up fpr. argument
last Monday. Judge; Sloss, turning to
Commissioner Devoto,': said: "Mr. De
voto. the State law requires that the elec
tion officers must be appointed and the
lists thereof completed within, twenty
flve days, prior to the election. There is
no discretion allowed, the- law strictly
stating that .the list must be completed
within ..twenty-five days. Has this stat
ute been observed?"
% "Well.", answered Devoto, "nine hun T
dred of the twelve hundred officers have*
been appointed and citations have been
issued for 300 more. The plaintiff in this
action can have the list of those ap
pointed if he wishes. to."
"That la all we. ask," said Attorney
Dam, representing the plaintiff, "and if
Mr. Devoto will promise us that we can
have the list of .'9OO and the others as
they are appointed the purpose of our suit^
has been accomplished." Devoto made
solemn promise that the list would be
given the plaintiff on application, and
the suit was then dismissed.
ADMISSIONS OF DEVOTO.
Now -the point involved is this: De
voto positively stated to the court that
of the twelve hundred, officers required
only 800 had been appointed within twen
ty-five days before the election as re
quired by law. but the list had notbeen
completed and announced as required,
and in fact trie list is not completed yet.
, This fact, it is announced by Mr. New
berry, exists notwithstanding the" fact
that the Election Commission had in its
possession a list of several hundred ap
plicants.rfof'positions, every one of them
legally qualified. to servtj as. "election of
'flcjecs. v *JThe:c commission \u25ba has refused to
I'apporrit themrand .'thus complete .the -list
as required by law owing- to the fact that
they: refused to-announce absolute-allegi
ance to the. Ruef-SchmiU ticket. . ,
'Ev^ry-man that went on the list .as an
election, officer was believed to-be a Ruef
adherent and. notwithstanding the fact
that hundreds stood ready to perform the
functions of the office in legal manner,
the administration. -refused, to accept their
applications for appointment and thus
willfully, delayed the completion of the
list beyond the time . prescribed by the
State law. , Now. comes me Penal -Code
and says:
"Every person charged with the per
formance of any duty, under any pro
vision of any law of this State relating
to elections who willfully neglects or re
fuses to perform tt or who, in his official
capacity, knowingly and. fraudulently
acts in contravention of any of the pro
visions of such laws is '\u25a0'-â¢ " * punishable
by fine not exceeding one thousand dol
lars or by Imprisonment in the State
Prison not exceeding five years, or by
both." ' ; .
<ARE TECHNICALLY GUILTY.
, Thus, said Mr. Newberry yesterday, the
Board of Election Commissioners stands
technically; guilty of a felony. Whether
or not the , board will, be called i to de
fend itself in the criminal court In the
face of-such positive demonstration of its
culpability is a question that the decent
element of the city must determine.
Attorney Dam and Commissioner De
voto were summoned before Judge Sloss
yesterday, who informed them that, he
would set aside the order heretofore made
submitting for. decision the case institut
ed by, Newberry against the Election
Commission to compel the board to strike

name? that had been legally entered and
place in upon the calendar for' . reaiju
merit Tuesday morning. ,
Judge Sloss Informed counsel that hta
action was due to the fact that certain
questions involved were not clear in his
mind. v He asked for additional inves
tigation-on s the part of counsel, as to
section - 1109 of the Political' Code,
which provides as follows: '.'. v
"Any person roay : proceed by action*
in the (superior Court to compel the
clerk to cancel' any entry: made on the
Great Reg-later illegally, or that ought
to be. canceled by reasons of facts that
have occurred' subsequent . to the - time
of such entry."
Tha court said there was a question
as to whether or not the court had any
power to compel the clerk . to cancel
any name which the clerk could not
himself have canceled-, in tHe preforra
ance of "â¢ his | ministerial duty, and
whether the court had the power to in
stitute an original ' inquiry to ascer
tain whether or not the person regis
tered was illegally, registered or had
lost hjs right to have his name remain
on the register, unless the clerk himself
had the right to institute such an in
vestigation,-which.was questionable, as
each elector .was* only registered after
making proper affidavit, which affidavit
the clerk must assume recites the truth.
IIEVOTO MIJKAKS WORD.
Judge Sloss having stated' his atti
tude, Attorney Dam informed him that
Commissioner. Devoto, in keeping with
the general conduct of the administra
tion, had broken his ex
pressed word that Mr. Ne.wberry could
have the list of election officers ap
pointed.
."They have permitted 'â¢ Mr. Newberry
to glance at the, list,"' said Attorney
Dam, "but positively refuse to permit
him to copy it. They informed him last
Tuesday that they would have a copy
of the list made for him, but up to date
have not given it to him and now in
form him that they cannot have it until
next week." *Â»
"We cannot delay the work of our
office to permit you to copy this list,"
said Devoto, his face reddening. .
1 "Well, I think that if the commis
sion would try it could so arrange its
work as to enable the plaintiff here to
'copy that list," said Judge Sloss "The
plaintiff is entitled to more thane mere
inspection of the list."
- "I will try to fix it; we will do the
best 'we can," said Devoto, and then
turning to counsel announced that he
would immediately go .to the office and
ccc that the question of the list was
settled. When he reached the corridor,
however, he 1 informed Attorney Dam
and Mr. Newberry that he had other
court business to attend to and hur
ried away, again breaking his word.
MOTION HIDES SCHEME.
The purpose of the motion mnda by
Devoto when the case was last called,
demanding that all ;of the persons
whose names It was sought to . have
stricken from the roll bo made defend
ants, has become apparent. Should all
of these persons be made defendants
they cannot be proceeded against until
such time as they have been personally
served with summons, As it is well
known that not more than 5 per cent of
the alleged stuff ers can be found, De
voto's motion, should it prevail, will
have the effect of absolutely killing
the suit until after election.
It will make little difference whether
it prevails or not, for the Republican
League, has determined to place a
watcher *at every booth and every one
of these men will be promptly arrested
if he tries to vote. All will then be
given the opportunity to determine be
fore the criminal court the contention

BIGHT' OF FEEE SPEECH
Former Decision of Supreme
Court Is Against Present
I Contention of Euefters
.The candidacy of John S. Partridge for
Mayor is â¢teadily growing in public fa
vor. Vqters who wer* inclining to Ruef
and Schmitz at the beginning of the mu
nicipal campaign are now in the Part
ridge column vigorously supporting the
cause of common honesty.
. Every jhamefal insult hurled at t ha
Fusion nominees by the rowdy \u2666le
nient of Ruef s camp reacts against the
candidacy of Schmitz. At the sessions of
the Republican convention is the Al
hambra Theater it was noted that the
ruffians in the gallery took orders from
the boss of the. Schmitz administration.
The inference is drawn that the foul
mouthed grafters in tbe gallery of Gari
baldi Hall last Thursday night got the
tip from their leaders to interrupt Mr.
Partridge, and apply unspeakable epi
thets to the standard bearer of the . Fu
sion forces. ,
To the credit of the citizenship of San
Francisco it can be said that good and
true men of the Union Labor party in
the audience Indignantly cast away their
Schmitz buttons when they saw with
their own eyes the exhibition of vile tac
tics on the part of the grafters in the
gallery. Mr. Partridge's candidacy caa
not be weakened by the insults of hU
adversaries.
Citizens of Republican and Democratic
faith who have joined hands in a com
mendable contest to redeem San Fraacis
co from the curse of graft and the blight
of corruption, have chosen Mr. Partridge
as their nominee for Mayor and they
insist under the law that their leader
shall have the rljht to speak his senti
ments freely in every Assembly district
of the city. Ruffians, aided by a sub
servient police force, may attempt to
abridge the light of free speech, but act*
of lawlessness will surely react against
the grafters' candidate for Mayor. .
Partridge is endowed with the courage
of his convictions and will denounce the
grafters at every speaking point of the
campaign. : Another meeting will be held
at Garibaldi Hall. - , â¢
Abraham Ruef, manager and partner
in the political fortunes of E. E.
Schmitz, has contributed to the legal
lore. of this State, as evidenced by the
records in the office of the County
Clerk, some evidence that in past years,
when it was to his advantage, hÂ« could
give expression to an honest view of
the election law as he found it. And.
strangely enough, his expression- of
thought at that tfme uttered will soon
confound him in the effort of hi 9 Board
of Election Commissioners to violate
the law and every iota of ethics that
remains in the game ot politics since ho
became prominently identified there
with. â¢
Ruef is now endeavoring to secure
from the courts a decision permitting
him to do that which he knows Is un
lawful and politically dishonest â to
place on the ballot under Republican
and Democratic, headings the names of
the men that were nominated by tho
Union Labor convention and subse
quently indorsed by the disorganized
herd that withdrew at the conclusion
of tbe regular conventions of the two
parties named, and sought to dignify
their conventions by announcing that
in view of the fact that fusion had been
accomplished they alone were entitled
to the use of the regular party names.
How his view 3 have been changed as
to the rights of parties and of all tha
people is well shown by tha record in
the case of the so-called regular local
Republican organization against the
Board of Election Commissioners that
was tried in the Superior Court In 1903.
In that casÂ« the so-called regular Re
publican organization sought to com
pel the Election Commission to give its
candidates, a place on the ballot under
a Republican heading. By consent
Of both sides a writ' was issued, pro
forma, directing that the commission
respond to the demand. Upon this pro
forma writ an appeal was taken to thÂ«
Supreme Court. Then, in the. tran
script on appeal. Ruef voiced his honest
belief as to the motive that prompted
the demand 'o^ the so-called organiza
tion, but which he knew, as he knows \
now in the ease of his own sideshow
conventions, was not nor never was tha
regular organization. Then, he said:
The effort of the so-called resular
local Republican organization to have
the names of its candidates placed un
der a Republican designation has but
one object in view and that object ia
to deceive. the Republican voters. It is
not demanded with the view thlt it
will promote the interest of the Re
publican â¢ electors or the regular Re
publican candidates. Its purpose alone
is to ; deceive." = . '.-.-. i ,
This view wastaken by the Supremo
Court and it ruled that the candidates
could go Yon ths ballot only as "inde
pendents" and in no other way,
\ In'vlew of this expression the fact
that Ruef in the present litigation is
seeding: to win a point that will en
able him to deceive the voters, the boss
is placed in the true light. His mejhod
is to operate in the shadows, but the
records have dragged him forth. Now
'only .one thing remains to be said, and
tuat is this:
? His action- in the case of two years
ago should* not be commended too high
ly,'as'evidence of the fact that he was
once honest in his political views. It
only happened. then that he had occa
sion to use an honest medium to at
tain an end. "â¢ I

IPRESIDEICT OF THE HANCOCK
GIRLS' SWIMMING CLUB AND
PHOTO OF MEMBERS.
Over tsix-score maidens, pupils' of the
Hancock GramnÂ»ar School and members
of the Hancock Girls' Swimming Club,
splashed and frolicked about In tho
lar&e tank at the Crystal. baths yester
day afternoon. The young ladies, none
ot whom $s over 15 years of age. met
for the first time as an organized swim
ming party, and they constitute the
first schoolgirls' swimming club ever
formed either in San Francisco or on
the Pacinc Coast."
The organization is the Idea of Prin
cipal A. M. Armstrong, who believes
that physical culture and pastime of
this sort should be encouraged among
young pupils. The suggestion has met
with popular favor. The members of
the Board of Education heartily in
dorse the idea. Eventually, it is prom
ised, larsre swimming tanks .will be
provided by the city and will be used
exclusively by the school children.
When Professor Armstrong first
brought the mutter to the attention of
his classes the boys immediately or
ganized and aoout of them marched
lo the Crj stal baths on Thursday after
noon. The manag-emeni stated that
they were as orderly a body as ever
attended ihe place, and the success " of
the plan was apparent. Yesterday aft
ernoon the girls, 127 in number, left
the st-hool in charge of their principal
and teacher!?, and at the baths pro
vision had been made for bathing suits.
Hereafter they will each be provide.!
with a regulation suit, and the contract
for the supply is at present in \u25a0 the
hands of a local firm. Those who cannot
swim will be taught, and every care
is taken for the little 1 ones' safety.
It is proposed that the clubs shall
visit the baths on a certain day each
week. The noys will clloose one day
and the cirls another. During Monday
forenoon the girls will be the guests
of the Olympic Club management and
will have the use of the large tank. .

Works Board Ready to Con
sent to Use of Asphalt on
Macadamized Portion;
The Board of Public Works hag prac
tically decided to recede from. its pre
viously announced decision not to con
sent to the paving of the four ma
cadamized blocks on Van Ness avenue
with asphalt, as ordered by the Board
of Supervisors. The , Board of Works
has refused to abide the terms of an
ordinance passed last month by the
Supervisors because it insisted that the
blocks should be. bituminized In con
formity with the pavement on the re
maining portion of the thoroughfare.
Yesterday Commissioner Eagran, stat
ed that while he did not concede to
the Supervisors- the authority to des
ignate the pavement contrary .to the
recommendation of tne Board of Works
that bitumen- be used, yet he would
accept ; the. dictum of the Supervisors
In order that the property owners all
along the blocks . who are clamoring
that the two boards, cease their bick
erings may. be appeased, j Eagan says
he feels sure that the Supervisors will
hold out for asphalt' and rather than
the blocks Bhould not' be paved at all
he will vote at next Wednesday's meet-
Ing that asphalt be designated as the
pavement. As Commissioner Aigel
tlnger entertains similar views there
will thus be two votes in favor, of ,the
proposition. Maestretti. who has Ideas
of his own, may not fall . in with the
views of his colleagues. *
There is some hope that' the paving
of California street between Mason and
Jones will also be ordered despite
Maestretti's opposition on the ground
that' the work was not provided for in
the bond issue. Neither was the sew
ering of Sixth street in the bond Issue,
yet the work has been ordered and "the
contract awarded to be paid for out of
bond issue moneys. Aigeltinger ~ is
willing to vote for the work and he
hopes that Eagan will see. his way

HUNT ADDS
TO WOE OF
OFFICIALS
Says That Members of Board
of Works Cannot Enj oy
Emoluments and Then
Shirk All Responsibilities
HOLDS THAT ACT
IS CONSTITUTIONAL
Avers the Negligent Officials
Were Not Coerced Into
* Office and Therefore They
Must Shoulder Burdens
In: forceful language Superior Judge
Hunt declared yesterday that the Schmitz
administration Board of Works, while
charged with being guilty of non-feas
ance in office, cannot receive the emolu
ments of', office and then seek to crawl
out of Its responsibilities, even though
the shouldering of such responsibility re
sults in the stripping of the pockets of
Its- members through the recovery of
damages by those that have suffered per
sonal ."injury 'or j the loss'of â¢ relatives
through the neglect of the board to prop
erly and conscientiously perform the of
ficial duties imposed upon it by the law.
The ' decision was reached in' the* suit
instituted against Frank A. Maestretti
and other members of the Board ot
Works by the widow and children of the
late Daniel Murphy, who met his death
through the failure of the Board of
Works to repair a broken sidewalk on
Third street. ' .
The Board of Works demurred to the
complaint, setting up the contention that
the law which Â» imposed the , burden of
damages was unconstitutional. This de
murrer the court overruled, directing the
defendants to file answer, disposing of
their allegation of unconstitutionality of
the law they have run afoul of, by stat
ing that no man is compelled to accept
office, but once he has done so he can
not escape its. responsibilities _ after hav
ing enjoyed its emoluments. , ....I.
LAW IS -CONSTITUTIONAL./- !1;/! 1 ;/
As â¢ Judge Hunt's decision is the first
that has gone into the question of the
constitutionality, of the act : It . is of
special interest, and Is given in full as
follows:
The charter provides that no action will lit
against the municipality tor injuries sustained
by persons In consequence of the defective con
dition of the sidewalks or ' public streets of
the city, but the parties upon whom; rest the
legal duty to, repair such defects and * the
officials through whose negligence such defect
ive condition remain* shall, with the sureties
upon their official bond, be Jointly and sev
erally liable to the Injured party for, the dam
ace, sustained.' ..,..' , \u25a0\u25a0 ' \u25a0
It is claimed by defendants that, the above
, provision of the charter is unconstitutional,
upon the grbund/^as I understand the argu
~ment,' that tha charter does not impose an ab
â¢ solute and I tixed duty upon the defendants to
repair said defects or conditions, ' but â¢ Invests
them .with a quasi Judicial discretion in the
premises.
In the caseor Heath vs.- Maestretti; recently
decided by the ' Supreme Court. .it | was held
that it is the duty of the Board of f Public
Works to repair or cause to' be repaired dan
gerous or defective , conditions., in the â¢ public
highways of the city; argument tnerefore upon
this point is foreclosed, by. the ruling laaÂ»
mentioned. â¢\u25a0 . '\u25a0 \u25a0â¢ v ' .'â¢."â¢' \u25a0'*. \u25a0 \u25a0"?
The basis of -defendant's argument, however,
in- support -'of:- the iunconstltutlonallty. of..ith?
above provision seems to be that it Imposes
an onerous liability upon the officials named.
Under the provisions of the consolidation
act the duty of repairing- defects upon public
highways* -was cast .upon the -Superintendent
of Streets and Highways. In an action brought

KNEW OF DEFECTIVE WALK.
The complaint herein .avers that defendants, |
at and prior to the time of plaintiff's Injury,
were fully cognizant of the defective condition
of \u25a0 said sidewalk, but nevertheless , failed to
repair It or cause 'it to be repaired.
It Is a well settled princlpte of . law that
when one sustains an Injury under suchcir
cumstances through the nonfeasance or mls
fÂ«aEance of a public official the latter is liable
and as was said by the court In 4 Hill 630,
"this rule is a healthful rule and founded upon
sound principles of public policy." \u25a0....-Â» \u25a0
- In Doeg vs. Cook, 126 Cal. 216, the plaintiff
was Injured by falling, into a culvert upon a
public street In the town, of San Buenaventura.
He sued the Town Trustees and the Town
Marshal.' with \u25a0 his sureties. -to recover dam-,
ages. â¢ By the charter of that town the Trus
tees had the power to provide for the , keeping
in good repair \u25a0of the public streets and trie
Supreme Court held that the action was main
tainable. :\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0--\u25a0\u25a0
It would be strange Indeed If a provision
of law designed to enforce responsibility-' foi
nonfeasance In office should be unconstitu
tional. The law coerces â¢no man to \u25a0 accept
office, but if he' does -he cannot . > receive its
emoluments without accepting its responstbil
Hies. \u25a0>\u25a0.\u25a0 If he takes the j benefits he must - beai
the \u25a0 burdens. \u25a0 . â¢
For' thes* reasons I am of opinion that-na
constitutional 'objection; exists to the charter
provision in : question, and. as the Supreme
Court has â¢ held that . under the charter \u25a0 the
liability, for > Injuries sustained through" de
fective i conditions of the public hlehway^ls
upon the -Board of/; Public Works it results
that â¢ the. demurrer \u25a0to the complaint herein

MYSTERY IX ACCIDENT
Gilchrest Ascribes Escape
From Death to Fact That
Footing Was Not } Wood
BERKELEY, Oct. 20.â Death in ter
rible form threatened C. T. Gilchrest, an
assistant Instructor in the college of elec
trical engineering, while engaged in a
demonstration before his class yesterday
afternoon, and but for the fact that he
stood" on a cement floor. Instead of wood,
he would have been electrocuted on the
BpOt.
Gilchrest's right hand was enveloped In
a ehcet of fianie, as the result of a myster
ious combustion of forces in the dynamo
switchboard he was operating, and to
day the member is bandaged, while Gil
chrest thanks fortune that lie was saved
from death. ' --
, A current of 2200 volts was released
when Gilchrest attempted -to throw a
high tension switch in the testing lab
oratory, and this current seared and
scorched the ricsh of bis < hand. The
mighty current would have swept through
his body, killing, him instantly, had Gil
chrest's feet touched wood, Instead of
cement.
Gilchrest cannot explain how the ac
cident happened. Ordinarily his attempt
to throw on a high tension switch would
have been a elxnple matter, meaning
nothing more than the jerking of one
handle and the release of another, but
yesterday some mysterious forces oper
ated to hinder this procedure, and the
current was carried through Gilchrest's
hand, instead of being confined to the
switchboard apparatus. The university
man will carry for a long time a re
minder of his narrow escape from elec
trocution, in the shape of a scarred
and maimed right hand.

VESTRYMEN DEN V STORY
Declare Emphatically That
Money Was a Gift Given
-: as Tokens of Appreciation
' OAKLAND, Oct., 20,âRev: William Car-,
son Shaw, for years rector of the Church
of the Advent,- in East Oakland, has
severed his connection with that church
and left last evening for Spokane on
his way East to join his parents in Cana
da. In connection with his departure the
story is given publicity that all was not
harmony in the congregation of Dr.
Shaw ! and that he was given $500 by tho
trustees as ."an inducement to leave at
once. It was said that Dr. .Shaw was
liked by. the younger members of 'the
I congregation for his athletic and liberal
I ways, but that the older members did not
I approve of some of / his actions. This
story is ! denied by the \u25a0 vestry ?of the
church, .-who. say that the gift; of $5(0 was
as a compliment, to, Dr. Shaw, and that
there was not the least trouble. ./'
A. L. v White, one of the vestrymen,
said to-night. ' . .'\u25a0'\u25a0â¢-.
! It Is absurd rubbish to say that Mr. Shaw
. was offered ?SCO to leave uur church. -We j
of the vestry learned from Mr. Shaw shortly
after he went East In June to visit his parents ,
that he intended to leave our parish with the
close of the year. Soon alter he returned to
Oakland he announced to the congregation that
he was to resign. He stated that he would
remain with us until Christmas if we desired
him to do bo. ' \u25a0 â¢\u25a0-'â¢-' ...
As our church year ends with the beginning
of Advent . next month, and as Mr. Shaw
wanted to join his family in the East he de
cided to depart sooner than he had originally
planned and the vestry, appreciating the past
services of Mr. Shaw, presented him with JSOO.
as we believed he was in need of and was
deserving it.
Shaw was on amiable terms with the vestry
and was well liked by the young: and old
alike. â¢
Dr. H. I. Jones, another vestryman,
confirmed the statement of Mr. White in
every particular., :

PRISON IN LIEU
OF PAYING WIFE
George E. Miller in Hands of
Sheriff for Failure to Com
ply; With Alimony Order
IN CONTEMPT OF COURT
Another Chapter Added to
the :~ Sensational Divorce
Trial in Marin County
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Oct. 20.â Because
George E. Miller persistently , refused to
pay his wife $75 monthly as alimony for
the support of herself and two youngest
children imposed by the court several
months ago, claiming that he had no
means, Judge" Leonon adjudged him guil
ty of contempt and ordered him* into the
custody of the Sheriff, fixing' his bail at
$500. >v-.
Several months ago Miller applied for
a divorce on . the ground of cruelty.
Judge Lennon, as soon as all the testi
mony was in, denied the application, gave
the custody of the two youngest children
to the mother and ordered Miller to pay
her $75 a month alimony, $75 counsel fees
and costs. _" Miller neglected to obey the
order, claiming that he was financially
unable to-do so.
- To-day he appeared in court to show
cause why he .should not be punished
for contempt. Joseph K. Hawkins, at
torney for Mrs. Miller, tried to make Mil
ler admit that he was co-conspirator
with his brother. Henry F. A. MlUer. to
have Mrs. Miller arrested for perjury,
alleged to have been committed during
the divorce suit: Miller denied that he
was instrumental in having the com
plaint drawn or that he instigated his
brother to do it, but he admitted that
he went with his brother to the attor
ney and paid $120 with money that his
brother gave him for that purpose. .
In the examination of the books of
Miller's business, ' it was shown that he
had handled over $3000 during Septem
ber and October, of this year and there
was only a cash balance of $59. Among
the expenses was an installment on a
piano. The Indebtedness to his wife
now amounts to $421 95, Miller having paid
$20 last week.
Judge Lennon concluded that Miller was
guilty of contempt - and had plenty of
opportunity *. to pay the alimony Instead
of causing his wife to humiliate herself
by being dependent upon her friends. Hp
ordered the Sheriff to take Miller into
custody and fixed his bail at $500.
Mrs. Miller was recently arrested on
a perjury complaint sworn to by her
brother-in-law, Henry F. A. Miller, be
fore \u25a0 Judge Pryor. There is said to be
nothing to the case and Judge Pryor
will dismiss it.
TROUBLE OVER
OWENS RIVER
Government Files on Water
Eights and May Block the
. Plans Made'by Los Angeles
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20.â A report
was received to-day from the Owens
River region, through ex-Mayor Eaton,
! v.io has just returned from that coun
try, that the United States Government,
through Its Land Agent, Stafford W.
Austin, has posted claims to all of the
unappropriated waters of Owens River,
both surface and underflow, to the ex
tent of 200,000 inches.
\u25a0As this city has recently voted a
large, bond issue for the acquisition of
a water supply from tuat section, only
a portion of the rights to which have
as yet been secured, the filing on the
land by the Federal Government Is re
garded with some disquietude. It is
not believed that the action of the
Land Agent can seriously affect the
outcome of the city's effort to secure an
ample water supply from the Owens
River region, yet it may cause some in
terference and delay.
Eaton promises to lay the matter be
fore the Secretary of the Interior, with
the idea of causing an investigation
into the acts and purposes of Agent
Austin, whom Eaton charges with be
ing notwholly disinterested personally
in. the proposition: of the Governments'
acquiring Owens River land. \

A Day for Fractured Jaws.
It was fractured Jaw day yesterday at the
Harbor Hoesit&l. Two men. with their mas
ticating apparatus out cf ccmtnieelon were
treated at the emergency institution during
the early afternoon. Both applied for treat
ment within half e.n hour. Tho first victim
was John Vers, a teemster. Vers has stopped
to water bis team from a trough in front of a
â¢aioon at the corner of Vallejo and Sansoroe
streets. The pole of the wagon pushed the
watering trough out of place. Vers replaced
the drinking box, which had sustained no In-
Jury, and was preparing to drive away when
the eaioon-keeper came out and demanded 60
certs as compensation for alleged damage to
the watering trough. Vers protected that the
trough had srulfered no harm, and that anyway
he had only 5 cents in his pocket. Thereupon
th* ealoon-keecer smashed Vers In the face,
breaking his lower Jaw on the right 6ide, near
the Joint. The injury was eucb that only by
the performance of a delicate operation can
Vers be eaYed from lifelong disfigurement.
Vers had hardly left the hoepits.l when
Carlos Marianl. a sailor, stepped In. Mariani
had excited the amusement of come smail boys
on HtEt street, near Broadway, and the boys
elected the sailor to play tareet for their edi
fication. The youthful marksmen used many
kisds of ammunition, but no sccre was made
until one cf them selected a . nice, round,
heavy bowlder. It struck Mariani on the chin,
breaking his Jaw and filling his mouth with
teeth. Beth victims were sober.

strongly to-day in the hearings "now in

shippers . could ",\u25a0 be compelled under -the
contract .with ; the Armour Carolines to
use; cars 'of S this"; company -exclusively or
the railroad; would ; not ..transport their
freight. : At r the ' same â¢ time, . he said, the
schedules -of ; the road would permit 'the

PAXTDN TELLS
A SPICY TALE
Asserts That Former Wife's
Temper and Tongue Drove
Him to Abandon Her
a:gAIN PLEADS POVERTY
Says He Is Unable to Give
His Children Sum They
Demand for Maintenance
5 Blitz W. Pax ton flleda number "of af
fidavits yesterday in .support of .his con
' tention that , he :Is j| financially to
meet the demands of his -blind ; son, . John
Ar Paxton, and his"- invalid;: daughter,
Roma, for an', indefinite "continuation of
the ; payment to them' of ; $100 . a month for
their ; support. ; lii his affidavits he also
throws some side lights on "the' causes
that are responsible for the; bitterness of
his ; opposition to ; the appeal of his- af
flicted, children. ; . ; ,- \u25a0 ] .
"The affiant admits that he deserted
and abandoned his former wife, Mrs.* Be
ssie E. Paxton," says Paxton In his af
fidavit, "but asserts that he was, com
pelled to do so," owing-to -her; meanness
o* temper and bitterness of tongue; which
made the. life of this affiant unbearable.
. Mrs. Paxton. further alienated:the.affec
.tion. of the parents of this . affiant for
him and when i this affiant returned from
his trip abroad.it was only to learn that
his father, John A. Paxton, V had abso
lutely disinherited him, as he did not wish
Mrs. Paxton to benefit in any way from
his estate, owing to the meanness of her
conduct."
.Paxton further states that since his wire
divorced him she has endeavored by every
means :to humiliate him and cause* him
mental suffering. In support of this as
serton he' cites the fact that she went
on the vaudeville stage In order to call
attention to the fact that she was his
former wife and had been discarded by
him she took "Bessie Blitz' Paxton" as
her stage name, a fact that caused him
great distress.
As to the allegation that he has stated
that he would not give any more money
for the support of his invalid daughter
Roma he says this is not true. What he
did say, he says, is that she Is well able
to do something ,, to provide for herself
and that she should prepare herself "In
such a manner that she will be able to
enjoy an income from her own exertions.
Turning to" the question of. finances,
Paxton reiterates his statement that he
Is not financially- able to pay his chil
dren the sum they demand, but that he
has done and will in the future do all he
can for them. Many other affidavits were
presented by him corroborating ': his state
ment that he has quit his position at the
Bank of Santa Rosa and that he only
has a small income, from which he must
support his present wife and child. He
denies that he is living luxuriously, but
asserts that on the contrary he lives very
economically and plainly.
: Upon the conclusion of the reading of
the affidavits Judge Graham took under
advisement the question as to whether
or not Paxton should pay his children
temporary maintenance pending the final
adjudication of .their action. The court
said It wtiuid !f render a decision next
week and give the' main case as early a
hearing' as possible. v:
Dos Poisoners, Beware.
Dog poisoners have become so ac
tive of late that the Society for the

WIFE ACCUSES
HERO OF WAR
Captain Philip H. Going
Is Made the Defendant in
an Action for Divorce
DESERTION IS \ ALLEGED
He Is Decorated by Mikado
for Conspicuous Service
as Master of Transport
\u25a0 Philip H. Goinar, masterof the trans
pacific Hner. America Maru, has returned
to San Frapcisco crowned with a portion
of the glory > that \u25a0 fell to Japanese arms
In ; sanguinary ' conflict with the subjects
of the great White Czar and decorated
by -the Mikado with the Sixth Order of
the Sacred Treasure, only to be served
with' summons in a divorce suit instituted
yesterday by his wife, Bertha Jane Go
ing. Mrs. Going asserts that she mar
ried her husband In Oakland on August
11, . 1902, and that he abandoned her on
May. IQ, 1901. Continuing, she says:
"Captain Going is master of the Toyo
Kisen â¢ Kaisna steamship America Maru
and as such receives a monthly salary
and commissions in excess of $400. Dur
ing the war between Japan and Russia
he was a master In the Japanese trans-
I port "service and as such received a
! monthly Income in excess of $SOO. and
' there is . now due him from the steam
ship company a large sum. In addition
to this the defendant owns an interest
in eighteen acres of land known as
"Traverston," located In Tehama County,
that is of large value.
"Mrs. Going asks. the right to resume
her maiden name. Goethe. She next as
serts that she is without funds with
which to prosecute her suit, and she asks
that he be compelled to give her $500
counsel fees and $200 a month alimony.
Upon her petition a temporary restrain
ing crder was issued enjoining Going from
drawing any money that may be due
him from the steamship company and
from disposing of his Tehama County
country place. The restraining order was
Issued, said Attorney Saffold, represent
ing Mrs. Going, "because it is our opinion
that when Going sails in ten days from
now he will c?use th* steamshp com
pany to change his run and never re
turn to this port again."
A decree of divorce was granted yes
terday to Jean B. from Catherine Lan
nes for ? desertion. .''\u25a0-,
Judge Kerrigan issued a decree annull

mother.

B. against Ida M. Gibson for cruelty;
Katherine A. against William F. Eld

ace, as alleged by people residing la
the neighborhood of the quarry. The
question as to whether or not the tem
porary injunction heretofore issued
against Gray. Bros, should : be made

RUEF'S BACKERS.
*-p-HE Mayor's campaign for the re-election of* Mr. Ruef is rap
idly becoming a study of the lawless and )he. obscene! Mr.
* iVrtridge's meeting in Garibaldi Hall on Thursday night was
interrupted from the galleries by a gang of Ruefs supporters. The
interruptions lasted to the end of the meeting. They were not in
the form of inarticulate noise. The ruffians who were ornamented
and advertised by- the Schmitz buttons they displayed kept up a
fire of filth and obscenity that soon drove all the ladies from the
hall. Mr. Partridge stood his ground through it all and said to
: he obscene gang: "You are not going to win by such work. You
can't win this fight by tearing down signs and breaking up meet
ings. You are not going to win at all, for you are beaten now."
The police, whose duty it is to preserve order at public meet
ings, were conveniently absent, and at the close of his speech, made
in spite of the blackguards, Mr. Partridge was protected from per
sonal violence by his friends and by his own courageous attitude.
The spirit of the mob was exactly in line with the utterances of
Mr. Ruef in his four hours' harangue at Alhambra Theater. It
follows the theory that no one in this city has any rights by law
but by the sufferance of the Mayor and Mr. Ruef. The reform
campaign has to be carried on at personal risk, for Ruef and the ;
Mayor have inflamed every lawless and disorderly element in the
city to the point of making all kinds of attacks upon the personal
rights of their opponents. The poor devils who are their instru
ments are not so much to blame after all, for Mr. Ruef told them
in hi? Alhambra speech that their conduct was "true Americanism."
The responsibility is higher up than the frowsy and foul-mouthed'
creatures who belch billingsgate from the galleries. It is with the
Mayor and Ruef. It is due to them that the city is in a state of
anarchy, that the police, approved in neglecting their duty in one
direction, are neglecting it in all, and that while they are doing
politics, the burglars, footpads, highwaymen, sneakthieves and
porch-climbers are rampant in the residence districts. The law is
no stronger than the point of its least enforcement, and citizens
hold their property, their right of assembly and their lives by a
frail tenure, while the Mayor makes his campaign for the re-election
of Mr. Ruef.
COMPELLED CO-OPERATION.
4fc j XESTIMABLE blessing of aridity" may at first sight appear
I a self-contradictory phrase, but as it appears on the context
*\u25a0 of a chapter called "The Fitness of Western America," in the
new book "Constructive Democracy," by William E. Smythe, the
irrigation and land reclamation expert, the consistency of the ex
pression is forcefully brought out. It is aridity that compels co
operation, and this co-operation not only brings the most perfect
conquest over natural resources, but develops the highest type of
civilized and social man.
It is very gratifying to the whole country and especially to our
side of the continent to ponder the setting forth by this able expo
nent of the unequaled advantages of the Western half-continent;
showing that what for long seemed the curse of a drought}' desert
i< truly a blessing in disguise. This feature of the new book is an
extension of the argument on the same .lines that was made by
Smythe in his "Conquest of Arid America." It carries the idea far
"beyond the mere physical mastery of the natural resources of that
rich land which is only awaiting water to enable its fertility to
sustain a dense and prosperous population, and shows that the har
moniously united effort of whole communities of men, which the
driving back of the desert will enforce, is destined to produce men
of a superior mental and moral type.
Co-operation, he says, is the word of this new century, and the
extent of co-operation among men is the measure of their civiliza
tion. "Aridity commands men to irrigate the land; and' irrigation
is an endless miracle. It exerts a varied and far-reaching influence
on the whole fabric of industry and society. * * * Elsewhere
men may co-operate; here they must co-operate."
The wonderful effect that necessity put upon the pioneers of
New England to develop a peculiar fiber of resourcefulness in indi
vidual struggle is shown to be in striking contrast to the new type
of strong manhood which the efforts for mastery of the West will
bring into being. The first environment made the self-reliant qiial
itv of the worker striving individually â a very necessary mental
equipment; the second will mold these self-reliant American char
acters, by the stern necessity of winning an existence from arid
deserts, into the pre-eminently social and co-operating type.
THE NEW JERUSALEM.
T^HE Zionist movement contemplates the settlement of the Jews
1 of the world in Palestine, under a government of their own,
which will bring the scattered people together in a nation, so
that all Jews may have a country. Whether this dream is ever real
ized or not, it is evident that a new Jerusalem is being builded on
the old city of David. The tourist travel to Jerusalem is enormous
and constantly increases. It leaves so much money there that the
people are getting rich, and a trade is springing up of such, dimen
sions as to attract the attention of the commercial nations.
In the long list of new articles in demand there are machines,
sewing machines and others used in the domestic arts, iron bed
steads and metal furniture, modern mattresses and bedding ; . and
household goods and articles of luxury, bath tubs and plumbing.
The natives, grown rich, have taken to building modern houses in
place of the square houses with' flat roofs of the Bible times. These
modern houses require modern mechanics in construction and much
imported building material and furnishings.
It is said that the hotels and lodging-houses required to take
care of the travel make one think of Los Angeles, where the art of
caring for tourists has been fully mastered. It jars one's sense of
reverence somewhat to hear "bawlers" soliciting passengers for Cal
vary and Gethsemane, but that is what the travelers want to see, and
S3 it is business.
If Jewry assemble in Palestine, it is possible that the temple will
be rebuilt, just as it was built by Solomon, and one of the world
religions will renew there its glories in rivalry to Rome, Lassa and
Mecca.
The United States has a Consul at Jerusalem, Mr, Selah Mer
jill, and it may be worth. while for our merchants and manufac
turers to inquire through him about the opportunity there for Amer
ican trade. Our countrymen figure largely among thp travelers and
are as good spenders as any, so that there is much American money
left in the city to be used in trade. .

OF CHICAGO WRITES A
CHARMING FAIRY STORY
Rays of the moon, brilliant -md bright.
Protect me by day. protect me by night.
Naught can harm me when In your embrace,
Protect me you must, ac child of your race.
Send out the halo seen often about you,
And I promise, sweet mother, I never shall
doubt you.
'Tf-'EIE moon Is made the subject of a
I new fairy story, "The Moon Prin
1 cess." by Mrs. Carter H. Harrison.
The volume is a worthy successor
to Mrs Harrison's "Prince Silverwlngs"
and "Star Fairies," says the Chicago In
ter Ocean.
The story begins in the Kingdom of the
Moon, . where the Moon Princess marries
Sun Prince Dorion. The Moon Princess,
with the longing of youth, asks permis
sion of her mother, the Moon, to visit the
Kingdom of the Earth. The Moon,
frightened at first at ..the 'dangers
through which her daughter might pass,
finally consents, and provided a ladder
of moonbeams on which the Princess and
her husband may descend.
The firsts paragraph tells how "the
heavens were a stainless blue, and the !
moon .shone out of them arrayed in sil- j
very garments. One by one the sky's (
matchless jewels, the stars, peeped out, \
studding that great celling with flashing
diamond points, until the whole dome
was a glittering mass of blue and silver.
The ocean ..below seemed- a big mirror,
made to catch and reflect the bewildering
beauty above, for, shimmering softly, he
carried in his shining depths all those
myriad lights." ._ .
The author takes the beautiful Moon
Princees through many strange lands and
adventures galore. During the journeys
the fairy guide relates wonderful stories
for the pleasure of the Princess. These
tales are novel and interesting. The leg-

The Moon Princess and Prince Dorion
finally encounter the inevitable villain in
the Black Dwarf, who dwells in the cav
ernous depths of the mountains, and
whose hordes of imps are continually
building the rugged peaks off the world.
The Black Dwarf admires the Princess
to such an extent that one day, when
she has lingered behind to gather flow
ers, he carries. her, away , to his ; mountain
home. It is then, in verse,; that she Im
plores the moon to cometo her aid. ,
The Moon mother comes to. her assist

The Moon Princess and Prince Dorion
are reunited and "live happily ever af

A CHAT WITH LOUISE.
You, have found him at last, have you,
Louise? The all-conquering knight of
your maidenly dreams, the hero of your
visions, the affinity whom your virgin
fancy has pictured through all the four
years since you were fourteen; the one
man more gifted, noble and handsomeâ
particularly handsomeâ than all other men
â adown this "bank and shoal of time"
his too long x wandering feet have borne
him to you; he has whispered low, throb
bing words into your willing ear, and
soon you are to be his'n. Isn't it Just
too sweet?
. Yes, he has comeâ your hero, your
knight, your peerless champion.' To be
sure, he clerks in a store at eleven per,
and his legs are somewhat inclined to
bow, and his left eye has an* undeniable
squint; but. he is your hero and your
knight, anyway, and that is enough, isn't
it, Louise?
Yes, it is enoughâ if you do not some
day awaken to an appreciation of the
bow ; legs, the squint, the small salary
and several other things that might be
mentioned. . Love i has power, and ever
will have power, to blind your eyes to all
these things; but it must be love of the
faithful, loyal, enduring kind, and I have
known women; and men in plenty, who
did not possess it. And if it happens that
it/is not yoursâ ah, it is ah unpleasant
thing \u25a0': to wake to a realization of wob
bling legs and misguided eyes and little
things like that in â¢ the one whom none
but ' you ever : idealized.
It rests with you, Louise. I am wishing
you-all the happiness human being may
know, .but if you attain it you must cre
ate much of It for yourself, for that Is
the way of life In this queer old world.
Hold to: your Ideal. The rest of us know
that it Is a very absurd affair, but the
refracting light of love may make it
beautiful to you until the very last of
earth's visions" has 'fadedâ and, we will
trust, /infinitely longer than that.. I am
wishing you ; happiness; yours are the
hands that ; must build itâ yours, and one
other pair. \.

SLANDEROUS tongues have "done to death" another victim. Foolishly,
but not less tragically on that account, a girl of twenty-one has committed
suicide in New York because of a libelous story which too* away from her,

The pity of it! The folly of it!
Why did she not stay to prove her innocence? She could have done so Just
â¢by staying, and going on her even way, looking her detractors bravely In the
face, shaming them to silence by the fineness of her self-respecting dignity.
Presently public opinion would have been saying: unanimously: "It la a crlma

LINCOLNâ O. aY. &. City. No one
ever set up the claim that Abraham
Lincoln was a "highly educated man."
that Is if the Question U from the
standpoint of a collegiate education.
He received but a short country school
education. By Individual effort he
gained a fair m*stery of the English
lang-auge, of American history and of
elementary mathematics, and, being of
a very observing nature, of a shrewd
turn of mind and practical In all things,
he managed to "pick up" knowledge
which stood him In good attad la

wrote in "Eighty Days Around the
World" that cormorants and pelicans
were customary Inhabitants of the
moveable wharves about San Francis

moveable wharves, consequently there
could not be as inhabitants of such,

have not been any pelicans in the bay

CITY PLEASES
THE RUSSIANS
Sk Officers of the Lena
Desire to Stay Here When
Cruiser Leaves for Home
Special Dispatch to The CalL
% ALHEJO, Oct. 20.-It Is expected that
the Russian cruiser Lena, which has been
interned at. the Mare Island navy yard
for more than a year, win depart from
here about November L She will take on
coal at San Francisco after she has re
ceived her breach locks and other por
tions of her equipments now stored in
the ordnance department at Mare Island.
The official orders of release from the
State Department and those from St.
Petersburg have not as yet arrived and
until they do the plans of the Russian
officers and their families will not be
known.
Six of the officers have their families
living in this city and these have re
quested the Russian Government to al
low them to take their wives and children
home on the cruiser. Whether this will
be done or not is now an open question.
The Lena may proceed to Vladivostok
and land the crew there and be turned
over to her owners,. from whom she was
leased at the opening of tne war. or she
may proceed to Japan and take on a num
ber of Russian officers held as prisoners
in that country. The officers of the Lena
are very much opposed to going to Vlad
ivostok, as recent reports from that city
state that there are nearly 68,000 officers
and petty Government officials awaiting
orders there and with winter coming on
the prospects are anything but pleasant
Apartments and food are high and hard
to get.
If the wives of the officers of the Lena
are allowed to return home on the ship
they will take from this country great
quantities of canned goods, cooking uten
sils and other household articles which
are unknown In Russia. .\u25a0'..'\u25a0â¢'â¢:' i. \u25a0'..'\u25a0â¢'â¢ : 'i
It was also learned at Mare Island to
day that six of the officers of the Lena
are so delighted with California that they
have put in applications for positions as
Inspectors and Government agents to
watch the construction of a number of
the ships of the new Russian navy which
it Is understood will be constructed In
San Francisco within the next two years.

rected to-day to a report that under
a new executive order giving President

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, "SATURDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1905^
BIG SUN SPOT CLOPS SOLAR
DISC OVER WIDE AREA.
It Is the Largest Phenomenon of Kind
Seen in Forty-Seven Years
ROSE O'HALLORAN.
The stupendous spot now visible on
the solar disk, though not ao compact
as the great formation of last Febru
ary, extends over a greater area In
parts, being 125,000 miles in length and
100,000 in width. From past records
of solar eruptions it can ba Inferred
that nothing of equal size has ap
peared in forty-seven years. .
Telescopically it was visible- on the
13th of the present month, was dis
cernible without magnifying power on
the 16th and is now central on .the disk
in about north heliographic latitude 10
to. 23 degrees. It is probably a return
in a much enlarged form of a group
that developed near the west limb on.,
the 28th of September. As may -be
noticed, it is more grayish than black
In aspect, for though sixty small um
brae are scattered toward the edges a
vast central tract of penumbra is near
ly free from these black formations.
These latter change rapidly in form
and position from, day to day, and
even in a few hours; the blending, di
viding and drift that are noticeable
betoken .the tempestuous motion of the
disturbed area. This is the eighth spot
of extraordinary size that has dimmed
the photosphere within the last ten
months. Unless decline sets in it will
be visible for several days yet

a cage. Dr. Creely says It Is the first
genuine case of hydrophobia he has
seen in this city. Cases of .this kind
are occasionally encountered In .the
southern part of tbe State. The dog is
a valuable one and every effort will be

Sir Ed ward. Grey Says Three

in the Statesman's Survey
LONDON, Oct. 20.â Addressing the City
of Landon United Liberal Society' this
afternoon, Sir, Edward Grey, former Un
der-Sccretary for Foreign "Affairs; . in the
Liberal^ administration -of 'i 1892-1595, >\ and
who in all probability- will.* be ""^Foreign
Secretary in the next Liberal.,' Cabinet,
said there was no "foundation for the sug
gestions that a change ;of -government
would bring a change of foreign policy.
The three cardinal- points of British for
eign policy, namely, friendship for. Amer
ica, the > alliance with; Japan . and ;â¢ the
agreement with France/ all had the In
dorsement of the. Liberal party. (
The : Liberals," he said,' were also of the
opinion that the position of Russia should
be re-established In the. councils of. Eu
rope,' whilo an improvement In the public
relations between Germany and < Great
Britain must be considered conditional
on the relations between- Germany, and
France, also . undergoing ' ' improvement.
The next election, however,: would be
fought on the; Question of free trade,
which had made London" what It was.
It - would be .impossible, he .believed, to
get -compensation for the loss of foreign
trade by any arrangement it was In the
power of fiscal reform to make. Sir Ed
ward . was convinced that retaliation had
always been -an absolute failure. The
Government had made a mess of the co
lonial conferences and consequently the
whole policy of. these, conferences had
become a danger. , He , concluded with
strong criticism of , the Government's
"tinkering with any reform." -

Murdock and Foley Clash in
Last Bound of the Tennis
Tourney Sunday at Park
RESULT IS DOUBTFUL
Three Teams Jet Remain to
Fight It Out for Honors
in the Doubles Division
Th* last chansjilotiship tennis tourna
ment of ihÂ» year Trill shortly corns to a
doe* and the cracks will hare a long- and
\u25a0well-earned rest from plaj\ The singles
event for the bay counties championship
irill be completed to-morrow and the
doubles will be finished to the finals at
least.
In the final* cf the singles, Percy Mur
6ock, the Alameda County expert, and
Charles Foley, of the Golden- Gate Club,
will come together. Many are of the
opinion that Murdock cleared the way to
ultimate victory when he disposed of
Clarence Griffln last Sunday. Still others
think that Fcley*s style of play will be
more successful against Murdock . than
ttbs Griffin's. Whatever the outcome
there will be an Interesting Tnat-t^h, and in
all probability a ' close one.
Murdoclc hao had more experience than
Foley, but the latter has youth and con
dition In his favor. Murdock last year
held the championship of San Francisco
County, while Foley has yet to win his
first cinsrles tournament- FoJey*s forte
is steadiness while Murdock plays a
ghowy game and like most players of this
kind is erratic. Murdock" g narrow es
cape from defeat at the hands of Griffin
has caused the former's stock to drop
considerably and those who have bean
figuring 1 him a sure thing are beginning
to have their doubts. Griffin, to many,
looked the most dangerous, man" In the
Tournament and he certainly came closer
CALIFORXIAS TWO STAR COACHES WATCHING THE FOOTBALL. CANDI
DATES GO THROUGH THEIR DAILY PREPARATORY STUNTS. AND OTOJER

to beating the Alamedan than any of his
other opponents.
Those -who have been watching Foley
in practice say he is a better player than
Grfla. This may bÂ« true, but Griffin im
proves in a tournament while Foley
drops off some. In Griffin, Murdock met
a player who was aggressive and forced
the play, while to-morrow he will be
opposed to a steady player who gets the
balls back in good chape and seldom
mskfts an error. The latter style of play
will prove a hard one for Murdock to
beat.
Only three matches remain to be
played In the doubles tournament, but as
on* of the four remaining teams will figure
in all those matches it will not be pos
sible to finish the event unless there
â¢ houM be a default, which is not at all
likely. The first match will be between
the Baker brothers and Carl Gardner
and Charles Dunlap. Th* former dis
posed oX Schmidt and Rolf* last Sun
day end many look to see them put Gard
ner and Dunlap out of the running. The
latter would be given little considera
tion bet for the fact that they disposed
â¢f Qrlffln and Murdock so handily. The
Baker brothers' steadiness Is expected
to pull them through.
Hi* winner of the match will play Q.
Hall and S. Gayness in the semi-finals.
Th* latter ar* outclassed by both teams
and stand no chance of reaching the
finals.
The final match should prove the best
â¢f the tournament. C. Foley and R. N.
Whitney will be c-Dposed to either the
Baker brothers or Gardner and X>unlap.
Foley and Whitney vs. Baker brothers
would result in an Interminable lobbying
match that would keep the spectators
occupied for several hours. All four lob
well and would revert to that style of
play in the back court.
The Juveniles will complete their handi
cap singles tournament on the publlo
courts to-day. Four players survived
last Saturday's piayand w^l meet in the
6eml-ftnals this morning. M. McLough
!'.n, the club champion, has won the cup
twice and looks to have a good chance
to annex it for keeps. In the semi-finals
he will meet R. Strachan and allow him
owe odds of 15. Strachan has an excel
lent chance to lower the champion's col
ors.
The other semi-final match will be be
tween Midget Johnnie Strachan and L.
Levinson. The latter will owe 15- while
his opponent will- receive three-sixths.
Strachan, although measuring but little
more than his racket, will keep his larger
opponent busy throughout the match.

CARDINAL MEN
WORKING HARD
FreshniaaCrawf ord Loofys to
Be the Man Who Will Get
the Job at Right Tackle
PUNTING IS HIS FORTE
Other Youngsters Seem to
Be Making Good and May
Play in the Great Game
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct 20.â
The freshman game has been fought and.
lost due to no fault on the part of the
Cardinal and the -work of turning out a
winning varsity eleven now has. the sole
attention of Head Coach Lanagran and
assistant Louis Bansbach. Upon the pres
ent squad are several freshman, who,
by thelt playing Saturday, demonstrated
that they are of caliber worthy of fur
ther attention on the part of the coacheÃ.
Foremost among these is Crawford, the
husky right tackle of the "pony eleven."
This lad not only has made the varsity
squad, but Is one of the two tackles which
have made sufficient showing to warrant
being put on the training . table list.
Should Crawford make the eleven that
represents the Cardinal in the big game,
he will undoubtedly be used as one of the
kickers, as at present the number of men
who can boot the ball for even a respect
able distance, is woefully small, i
As it was clearly demonstrated in the
game with Oregon on Tuesday, the Stan
ford team lacks proficient ends. None
of the present aspirants are in a class
with Jordan and Elliott of California.
Cardinal hopes are not blighted by this
fact however, for as soon -as . "Stump"
Stott is able^to resume practice, he will
go in to fill one of the vacancies. The
candldatets who have been playing the
major part of most of the games so far
are Lyons and "Jlmmie" Stanford. - It is
also possible that Cuthbertson, (5 who
played the left tackle position on -the
freshman, will appear as another man
for the terminals. He is fast and a euro
proposition when it comes to a "tackle.
In the back field the position of full
back would geem to be cinched for Crow.
In all contests he has been \ the ' first
choice and has usually lasted' all of the
initial . spasm and good part -of the -sec
ond. At right half "Bull" Chalmers has
no equal and is one of the trio left from
last year. For supremacy at- the re
maining vacancy in the backs, Vander
voort and Dole are leading a merry race.
"Van" seems to be the most consistent
ground gainer, but on the other hand
Dole Is one of the few good punters.
If Stott comes out for the "end as it
is now understood he will, >Kenny Fen
ton will be the " var sity". quarter back
and field general. Laumeister Is the next
man In line aftwr Fenton. '", . .- _ :
Thompson, the veteran left . guard of
last year, has a sure thlngr at his old
position. Either Frizzell or Lane will
hold the opposite position. Molfino and
Cox are both good men for center. At
tackle there are innumerable candidates.
From the indications so far. it would
seem that the men are Crawford at right
and Horton at left .
To-day the Sage Brush eleven from the
University of Nevada will line up against
the Cardinal. This contest will be \u25a0 the
next to the last which will be held on
the campus preceedlng the ' big - match
with California, as a week 1 , from Satur
day the eleven travels to Los Angeles to
try conclusions with the Sherman Indians.

Kittrelle Is Back in
â¢ the Going Once
Likely Babies May
Get Places on
Big Team.
. . . .
BERKELEY, Oct. 20. â Like a
draught of rich, heartening wine to the
big .varsity football squad was the de
cisive defeat by the freshman team last
Saturday of the Stanford - freshman
eleven, and the effect of- that 6 to- 0
score has been apparent during. the last
seven days. Everybody at the'univer
sity, from the greenest freshman up to
the veteran faculty chairman of ath
letics. Colonel 1 George C. Edwards, ap
preciates the fact that , there is
now on trial at the university a new
system of football training, and that
out of the crucible Into which Coach
Knibbs Is putting his brains, his per
sonality and a big bunch of football
material may come a blue and gold
â¢giant, able to defeat the cardinal on
November 11â or that out of the criicl
Â«,ble , may, come failure and -consequent
'disappointment, and possibly bitterness
of spirit, following defeat.
Realizing all this, it was ,a mighty
boost to tho hopes of the blue and gold
adherents when the Knibbs -medicine
was" seen to have woked wonders -.with
the green freshman team that went on
the gridiron and beat Stanford In the
game contest last Saturday. The var
sity has renewed confidence in the
Dartmouth coach, and confidence, say
the experts, worksjwonders in any kind
of a game, fronv finance to football.
\u25a0 Kittrelle, the' star end of the team,
has been put under a lot of pressure
during' the last week, and as a result
will step back into the ranks, after an
nouncing last Sunday that he I would
make no further attempts to gain a
place on the ; varsity. Like '. Snedigar,
the big end man found that the student
body- believed every California man
should stay In the ranks, and the be
lief took the form of persuasion that
proved irresistible. Kittrelle will play.
Fiveor six of the best. men from the
freshman team who showed up well in
the baby game, are out daily now, and
some of i them will make their places on
the varsity. Cunha, the big tackle, is
almost sure of a position on the team.
Stanton, the half back, who played so
brilliantly last Saturday,- is- a - likely
candidate, and Schaeffer, Snell,- Cerf,
Henry and Tuller all have, chances for
gaining the ''coveted distinction of var
sity-big "C's." \u25a0

OFFICEKS AEE ELECTED
The thirty-six-hole home and home
match between teams of twelve men
representing the San Rafael Golf Club
and the Menlo Golf and Country Club
having ended in a tie, a deciding match
will be played on neutral links. Sev
eral of the players are strongly in fa
vor of going down to Del Monte from
Saturday to Monday and playing the
tie off on the links there, but other
members of the teams think that they
could not spare the time. It is probable
that arrangements will be made to de
cide the tie on the course of the San
Francisco Golf . and Country Club at
Ingleside. It is desired to play on a
course provided with a clubhouse,
where accommodations can readily be
found for a party of two dozen at
luncheon.
At the annual meeting and election
of officers of the Pacific Coast Golf As
sociation the following were chosen to
serve during the coming twelve months:
Dr. J. R." Clark of the San Francisco
Golf and Country Club, president; W.
Frederickson of the. Los Angeles Coun
try Club, vice president; R. G. Brown
of the San Francisco Golf and Country
Club, secretary and treasurer; J. F. Sar

: STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 20. â
For the first time in . the history of
Stanford University the annual football
show, 5 which takes places the evening
after the intercollegiate football game
with California, will be held on the
campus. The played will be "Th*
Beauty Shop," the stirring burlesque by
J.C. Crawford, which was staged in
San Francisco' several years ago with
much success. - â¢
\u25a0 The management primarily intended
to have' the farce of amateur and local
authorship and to carry. out this idea
offered a cash prize of $50 to the com
petitior, submitting the best manuscript.
Only, three manuscripts were received
by the committee of judges at the close
of the given time and all of these were
so far below the standard that it was
thought -advisable to resort to some old
and simple burlesque or farce that had
proved itself on a professional stage to
be a success. ;

clubs enter, and each plays twice against

two matches will be necessary. At .tin

PERRY DAVIS
WINS A FIGHT
Scion of Old-Time Pugilist
Knocks Out Clasby Quickly
in Bout at Hawthorne Club
Perry Davis demonstrated last night at
the Hawthorne Club's boxing tournament
at Woodwards' Pavilion that "blood will
tell." even in a pugilist. Davis, the son
of the old-time Jack Davis, who fought
Choynski, cleaned up Jack Clasby, an
other heavy-weight, in the second round
with a clean knockout.
It did not look bright at the start for
Davis, despite his range and height, for
Clasby landed a stiff right that sent the
veteran's oilppring to the mat. But Perry
evened up matters quickly by landing his
man on the floor before the bell ended
the round. â¢ -:
The second opened with Davis stiffly
after his opponent, and when he landed
on the objective the count was taken.
The game opened with a four-round
event between Bruno Cassinl and Tony
Rugiero at 115 pounds. Cassini got the
decision Just as Lieutenant of Police To
b:n stepped to the ringside to stop the
number, though neither boy showed much
flis tress.
Billy Schultz, unattached, won the de
cision over Billy West, Hawthorne Club,
in a four-round go. In which both boys
were game and did a deal of hard punch-
Ing. West was ready to take all that
came, but the other youth was too ready
\u25a0with the punch.
Referee Al Young very sensibly stopped
the go between Johnny Murphy of the
HawJaorne Club and Danny Murphy of
Point Lobos In the third round, giving
Johnny Murphy the decision. The other
Murphy was wholly outclassed, being of
the "slats" variety of physique.
Jim Ford of the Hayes Valley Club won
tire decision over Jack Brown of the
Southside Club in four rounds. Willie
Wolf of the Ariel Rowing Club knocked
out "Jfobby" Otts of the Hawthorne
Club In the first round. Jim Horn, a
Hawthorne Club man, was awarded the
decision In his four-round event with
Kyle Whitney, a negro. The decision was
a rift to the white boy. Jack Rodney
won in the second round from Jim Llne-
K ar who was knocked under ihÂ© ropes

ANGELS OVERTAKE COMMUTERS IN PENNANT RACE
One of the most important events in
coursing circles for many months will
take place at Ingleside Coursing Park
to-morrow, when the" two . veteran grey
hounds, Sacramento Boy and Homer Boy
will meet in match races, the best three
out of five, for a side bet of $250 and a
liberal purse offered by the management.
These dogs have reputations only
equaled by the peerlesl For Freedom, and
the relative abilities of both dogs has
been much discussed by leashmen since
they were matched more than a month
ago. Both dogs have been stake winners
for the last six years. Homer Boy has
been defeating them right up to the pres
ent time, and he has always been en
tered in stakes with dogs of the first
class. Hie owner, O. Zahl, has a repu
tation of handling high-class performers,
and when his dogs go to the slips they
are ready for any kind of a test. '.
D. Walsh's Sacramento Boy is known
as the "honest greyhound." He has more
brackets to his credit than any other
dog in this country. Two times winner
of the John Grace Challenge cup and once
runner-up are among his numerous per
formances. He has participated in the"
Grand National Champion stakes and. has
lowered the colors of some famous local
and imported coursers.
Walsh's dog is known for his game
ness and cleverness. His strong point is
shown when he gets placed on a hare.
Once there, after the turn it is almost'
impossible for the opposing dog to score.
He works the game to perfection and
never loses an inch of ground.
In the John Grace Challenge, which
was run at Union Park in ISOO, he cap
tured first money, which amounted to
about $1000. In the first course he had
a severe trial with Sir Pasha and de
feated him in a race which lasted nearly
three minutes. - He met thereafter Royal
Anne, Floodgate, the great Palo Alto,'
Master Claire and Curtis' blue wonder.
Beacon. In all these races Sacramento
Boy was led to the hare, but defeated 1
his opponents after the turn. In the
final, when he met Beacon, Curtis' dog
was made a l-to-3 favorite. Beacon made
the first few points, but when the up
country greyhound took possession of the
hare the blue crack was no lgnger a
contender.
Homer Boy is a dog which runs simi
lar to S&cramento Boy. He is game and
clever and in the coming race fhe dog
that shows the speed will likely be re
turned a winner. Homer Boy has been
displaying recent form, while Walsh's
courser has not been running of late,
though he was entered a few weeks ago
and beaten after running an excellent,
trial. The betting is likely to be even
when the hounds meet to-morrow.
University Limits Use of Track.
BERKELEY, Oct. 20.â A new ruling
has just been promulgated by the uni
versity authorities by the terms of
which the football field and cinder path
on the campus may be used only for
college contests and academic league
field days. The ' executive committee
of the Associated Students decided re
cently that in view of the many re
quests received for the use^of ,the field
on the campus a line would have to
be drawn and so recommended to
President Wheeler that none but col
lege and academic league contests be
permitted. President Wheeler has ap
proved the recommendation.
Nolan Sues Harry Corbett.
William Nolan, manager of Battling
Nelson/filed suit yesterday against
Harry Corbett ,to recover $2500 left
with Corbett as a forfeit to eecure the
presence of Nelson in the ring on the
appointed day. This forfeit is claimed
by the club under the auspices of
which the fight was held, the allega
tion being- made that Nelson had for
feited the money through not being
present sharply on the hour appointed.,
Nolan alleifes that Corbett is holding
the money without right or authority
of law. -

SCOTCH GAME COXTIXUES
TO ATTRACT BIG CROWDS
Two Tournament* on tbe t Golden Gate
Park Green Brine Out Jinny
Promising; Players.
Ideal weather and a green in perfect
condition are attracting many Scottish
bowlers to the park these days. As in
the past, Saturady brings out the big
gest crowd, but the green is by no
means deserted on other week days.
Several of the experts find time, to get
out late in the afternoon, when the air
is crisp and bracing. As a rule tour
nament matches are played Saturday
afternoons. â¢.
The handicap doubles tournament,
started over a month ago, is proving
the^.most popular form of match. play
yet hit upon. . ThÂ« handicaps have been
well arranged and the poorest teams
have as good a chance. to win as those
playing from scratch^ The latter, in
many cases, have been asked to give
odds that left * them little chance to
win. Following is the standing of the
contestants In the two tournaments:

One day, of prosperity seems to . take
air the ginger out of the Commuters, for
yesterday they- hung out the big yellow
flag and 'dogged it to the limit. The Sl
washes played; ball like a flock of [three
time world's champions and by laying it
over the Commuters they sent the lat
ter back into second piace. Los Angeles,
by taking a fall out of Fisher's Tigers,
have the honor of being the headliners
of the league. Â»,\u25a0 \
The game was so. bushy and fuzzy on
the part of Oakland that it is hard 'to
describe. To begin with, "Graham was
wild, erratic and easy and did not. seem
to care whether the score, was -100. to 1 or
1 to L-- Then the fielders got weary and
so the' game dragged itself wearily aldng.
Seattle opened right ".up in the' ; first
spasm- when Walters beat" out a hit and
Kane got a pass. A wild pitch happened
and 'then along came Strelb with a safe
drive. In the third and fourth the tale
was repeated till Seattle's, total \ was
swelled to six. Graham. was passing. and
hitting batsmen right along, and when
he did put 'em V 6ver, "the: SI washes gen
erally flattened them.
Hall had a good day. Things were com
ing nice for him and he did not quit as
usual. With perfect support, , he man
aged to keep the Oaklanders away from
the plate till old Papa Van Haltren lift
ed a fast one over the right field fence
in the last spasm and saved the Com
muters the humiliation of being blanked.
Julie Streib had his batting eyes all lit
up like a. church and each of his three
hits counttfl In 'the run getting. Besides,
Julie stole a baseband scored two runs.
Croll managed to get .two nits out of two
chances with the timber. 'The "only man
on the Seattle lineup who failed to come i
jlhroughj wjth'i a bingle was Lauterborn.

PORTLAND. Oct. ,20. â McCreedie's
men /were fed. nine large horse collars
as their portion of the run getting in
the game with the Seals to-day. On
the Mother hand, the Seals -were very
patient and proved good waiters. That
is, they took advantage of the inability
of Messrs. Cy' Ferry and Eli Cates to
locate the disc over which the sphere
must pass in. order to please the um
pire. '\u25a0;\u25a0''
Ferry started out, but developed such
a streak of wildness that he failed to
locate one ball -in a dozen and six. men
.were passed to first , base.' An error by
McLean thrown in among the | free
passes in the first inning gave the Seals
two aces right off the ; reel. . Cates was
not much - better than . Ferry, or he
passed: Householder and Irwin, . filling

CANADA SENDS
MORE STABLES
Attracted by Kich Stakes and
Purses the Ferriss and;
Hume Strings Beach Here
WELL KNOWN RACERS
Many Eiders at Oakland and
More to Come â Murray and
Wentworth Horses Back
Among the more prominent arrivaU
at Oakland track yesterday were the
stables of J. C. Ferriss Jr. and James
Home from Canada. The latter Is com
paratively a new man In the business,
with a small but select string- In the
Ferriss consignment of thirteen an*
such well-known performers as Gay
Minister. Kd Tlerney. Fallen Leaf. J.
Ed Grlllo. Gamester and Oak Grove.
The *Â»tablea of George Wentworth
and Charley Murray were due to reach
Oakland last evening from Washlns
ton. where each played a conspicuous
part at the .Spokane and Walla Walla
meetings. With Ishlana. Red Cross
Nurse. Mocorlto. Dora I and .Salable,
Wentworth headed the list of winning
owners by a large margin at the Den
ver summer meeting.
There are jockeys enough already on
the Kround at the track across the bay
to run a meeting of indeterminate
length. Numbered among the array of
talent are H. I'.adtke. F. Graham; Au
buchon, who formerly rode for Sam
Hlldreth; Rtce and Battiste. two of the
best from St. Louis: Barrett. E. Walsh.
Crosswalte. E. Robinson. C. Miller.
Frank Otia. Sandy W. Smith; Griswold,
the Elliott stable pilot; it. Butler. L.
Fountain. A. Wright. Schade. Al Minder.
Willie Smith and O. Chandler. "FA a
Kill" Knapp and some more of the stars
will come on at the close of the Kaac
ern season.
W. B. Gates, the veteran campaigner
In the stable of Captain Rice, Is credited
with having earned winning brackets
on 99 different occasions. When ha
scores his century the aged gelding will
possibly be placed on the retired list,
his owner says.
T. A. Da vies has figured out that his
brown mare. Eleven Bells, has won 89
races, besides nine which do not show
in the guide. If this record Is correct,
the daughter of Quicklime has a chance
to earn a century mark.
It is reported that Â£n offer of $3500 was
made the other day for Rey Carlo, the
two-year-old owned by the Fox estate.
Rey Carlo recently reeled off thrte fur
longs in :25 2-5.
The horses owned by the deceased turf
man, D. Cameron, will probably be raced
by Mrs. Cameron until suitable purchas
ers are obtained. The great two-year old.
Sir Wilfred. Is the star Of the stable. This
crack youngster was beaten in but one
of his essays at the barrier, and then by
Daruma, from the stable of A. B.
Spreckels. in the first two-year old event
of the year, decided over Oakland track.
STANFOKD WILL MEET
NEVADA TEAM TO-DAY
Formidable Looking Line-Up
Makes Hearts of Cardinal
r: * ~~Rooters Glad
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 20. â
The sagebrush eleven from the State
University of Nevada arrived on the
campus to-day and will clash with the
varsity to-morrow afternoon at 2:30
o'clock on the old gridiron. The men
from the mountains include several star
players among their aggregation and
eight of their old team of last year.
Teams from this institution have al
ways stacked up as able opponents oC
either of California's large Universities
and it is probable from the Indications
of the showing which Nevada made
against Reliance this season the eleven
.now on the field will prove no exception
to the rule.
The make-up which will gladden the
hearts of the cardinal bleacherltes will
be one- of the best lines that has been
put into the fray at one time this year.
But for the fact that Stump Stott has
not entirely recovered from hia injury
the team would be in perfect condi
tion. The line-up will be as follows:
Stanford. Positions. Nevada.
La m b L. E,* R .Westall

R. A. Thompson L. O. R... Skinner

Abbott and Ellis Knowles, two Yale
golfers, will meet to-morrow in the
final round at thirty-six hqles, match
play, for the international champion
ship of the Intercollegiate Golf Asso
ciation. In the seml-flnal round to-day
Abbott defeated the clever Harvard
man; Percy Gilbert. Knowles defeated
Mason E. Phelps, a brother collegian.
Schmidt Wants Satisfaction.
Pitcher Henry Schmidt, who was re
leased by the Oakland club, has writ
ten a letjer to President Bert asking
that an Investigation be made into the
charges that he threw games to the
gamblers. The story that Schmidt was
crooked Is not treated seriously in
baseball .circles," but Schmidt says he
wants to have every evidence of doubt
removed.

MILWAUKEE. Oct. 20. â Kid Herman
of Chicago and Young OXeary of Mil

OIL PRODUCTION GIVES
FIRST PLACE TO KERN
But for Output of Petroleum the Honors
o)^'Highest Mineral Output Would
Go to Shasta County.
LARGE FIGURES FOR G OLD MINES
The oil output of Kern County during
the year 1904 placed: the county ahead of
all others in California in mineral pro
duction, but in products of mines, as dis
tinguished from oil wells, Shasta claims
the lead.' With oil added to its other
mineral products Kern's lead over Shasta
County is $421,0y0 in round figures. The
gain in production jin Shasta County in
a year is $1,69ti,650.-. The Redding Search
light finds that there are , reasons why
Shasta ( > will make a better showing for
1905 than In 1904, some of which . are
mentioned as follows:. -
. Shasta County has again taken her plact
far m the lead of- all the counties of thÂ« j
State in ; the matter of mineral output. . There !
is but one county that shows ; a greater total
output ot . minerals of ' all kinds and that is
Kern. The reason' for this is' that Kern'a
great oil fields have produced $3,431,403 worth
of petroleum during the year. ! And even that
only gives Kern the lead over Shasta of $421,
597. This will >be easily overcome by Shasta
In "1905, with the Great Western smelter and
Mammoth smelter to add to the general output.
There are two other industries in the min
eral line that will be important factors in In
creasing. Shasta' s output this year. The lime
Industry is growing and where in 1904 Shasta
produced but 18,000 barrels, of lime . valued at
$10,500, in 1905 the lime output will be at
â¢least doubled. â¢-' '."..- -:;\".
Another thing: In the State Mineralogist's
report for 1004 Shasta is net credited with a
pint of mineral water. This year Shasta's
output In the mineral water Una will take a
very prominent place on the builetln of the
State Minins Bureau. The report \u25a0, for 1904
does not mention sandstone as a product ot
Shasta. ~ This is another item that must takÂ»
a place in the report of 1905.
While Shasta County is - thus looking
forward, Kern County reports consider
able activity in its desert mining regions
that will swell Its total showing in out
put for the year 1905.
Signs* of mining development in the
State at large Include the establishment
of another smelter In Shasta County at
Kennett, the fourth smelter in the
county; the information that a syndicate
has acquired a large tract of mining land
at Saugus, Los Angeles County, for the
purpose of installing gold dredging
plants; and the request that the Geo
logical Survey has made j for contribu
tions of sand from placer mines in Ne
vada County, that they may be examined
for evidences of platinum. In a letter
Director Walcott of the Geological Sur
vey, tells what Is desired: V--,~-
On account of the increased demand for
platinum it Is the intention of this survey
to make an examination of the platinum re
sources of the United States. " -\u25a0""\u25a0;'
-It is proposed to collect the heavy sandt
from the placer mines In the United States
-where evidence of platinum has been found
by preliminary tests. The" samples thus ob
tained will be used in determining the best
methods of extracting the various mineral*
which have economic . value. It Is hoped that
in many places the separation and sale ot
these useful mlr.erals, such as magnetite, enro
mlte garnst monazite rutile. topaz, . zircon,
goEl.' platinum, lridosmine. etc., will become
a permanent and profitable industry.
NORTHERN COPPER MIXES.
The United States Geological Survey;
reports as follows regarding mining pro
duction in California in 1904: __
A, very considerable addition, to the future
copper product of California will come from
the undertaking' entered into by the United
States Mining Company in Shasta County.
The Mammoth 'group of mines in that county
has been acquired. .-, ' , . _
An English company, the Fresno . Copper
Company (Limited), is building at the mines
in Fresno County a i works which is to have
two furnaces and a converter plant.
. The plant of the Great Western Gold Com
pany at Redding was not started in 1904, but
will . be a contributor to the product of the
State during the current year.
The Balaklala mine In Shasta County has
been purchased by the White Knob Copper
Company, which has abandoned Its mines at
- Mackay, Idaho. The smelting plant at the lat
ter property Is to be removed to Calif ornia.
r The Bully Hill Company, which produces a
little over 4,000,000 , pounds of copper per an
num, has been acquired by Interests identical
with the General Electric Company.
The Kennett Copper Outlook reports
that the Bully Hill Company will reopen
the .Winthrop mine at Copper City.
According to a Prineville paper, . the
mining . of cinnabar In that vicinity is
â¢progressing* well: j f \u25a0 : }<
Pure, white quicksilver, worth $40 a flask,
flowed from the new cinnabar furnace on
Lookout- Mountain for a Â»hort time AVednes
day and ' then operations were discontinued
until a drier can be built. A few hours"! work
at the furnace,: which has been undergoing the
process of being "blown in" during the past
ten days demonstrated two things â that the
ore is rich with mercury and that, owing to
the excessive amount of mo:sture which it con
tains, it will be necessary to absorb this water
before the ore can ' be successfully treated in
the furnace -built for the purpose.
About ten tons of ore were burned Wednes
day out of which there was condensed about
150 ' pounds of quicksilver. A large percentage
was lost in the tailings and escape ot the gatws
caused from too sudden; slipping of the ore
down the pitch, of the lurnace.' when the oro
matter became dry- Otherwise results are
highly satisfactory, and construction will be
gin at once on a drier, so that as little time
as possible will be lost before getting the max
imum daily, output from the furnace.
FUTURE OF NEVADA- CAMPS.
J.'Dohnan Reavis .--.of . Los Angeles
writes to , the Los Angeles Mining Re
view regarding thejfuture of Southern
Nevada- mining camps: .
Convincing evidence of the richness and per
manency of the Southern Nevada camps is
shown in the recent action of conservative cap
italists in financing corporations possessing a
combined capital of. over $35,000,000 for the
purpose of supplying; this region with electric
power and connecting the various camps with
railroads. ' ,- 'â¢ - â '\u25a0
â¢, The ' first â¢of these enterprises, the Nevada
Power Mining .and Milling, Company, is rush
ing to completion a great electric power plant
on the Owens River \u25a0in California, â¢ 110 miles
away.- Its transmission line, has reached Gold
fleld and will soon be . delivering elecricity for
power heat "light and transportation. r.
The building :of this power line â¢ effectually
solves \ the fuel \u25a0 question for Nevada's mining
camps,' for all machinery will be operated by
electricity^ Hbe houses find stores wlll.be heated
by It and," as another company, organized by
Senator Warner Miller and others of .-New
York (the Bishop-Nevada Power Company),
has entered the neld, competition : will result
In keeping the cost ofser.Tice at right figure*
Soon the mines: of the camp will be lighted
by ' electricity; . mills ; will be run by the > same
power;, mining operations will' be modernized
at last; j but 'of greatest importance is the fact
that power will be â¢ provided to operate electric
railways. 4 Capitalists .who control the Tonopah
Railroad have already taken advantage of this
and ' have ; secured . the . street electric : railway
franchise^ In Tonopah.- In Goldfleld a corpora
tion â¢\u25a0' has secured \u25a0 similar privileges, and .; to
illustrate the value of, the Goldfleld "street rail
way franchise, Â» l \u25a0', may - state that $10,000. waa
offered i to and refused by the men. who securtd I
the same ten minutes after. the coupty commls- I

through I which Â« are '.slates, ," schists ; and altered
limestones split : by :\u25a0 igneous ; dikes, .; sueh ' aa epi
dote and porphyry, forming an ideal geological
condition for mineralization. The entire dis
trict Is a network of contacts, flssure3 and
cross-fissures, nearly all of which show the
presence of mineral and, in many, the outcrop
ping ore bodies are of high grade. In the
granite 'or on its contact, with volcanic rocks
some gold veins were evidently found in earlier
days as the ruins of an old arrastra testify.
The first record of the mining ot other ores,
however, dates to ls>7l, when the General
Thomas mine was discovered, and some high
grade "sand carbonates" were mined. About
seven years later high grade ore carrying sil
ver chlorides and copper carbonates were
shipped ifrom the Cabin mine In the extreme
south of the western range of hills.
The district may be said to have been
rediscovered in IW2 by prospectors from Tono
pah who located what is now known as the
Nevada- Alpine mine on the northwest end of
the mountain. The surface showing here was
very flattering, a strong body of lead carbonate
ore outcropping in a lime flssurer the values
being 40 per cent lead and 350 ounces silver
to the ton. L \u25a0 -
GREAT GOLD PRODUCTION.
John Plu miner writes that during
the ten years ending December, 1903,
the value of the gold output was Â£137,
831,228, or Â£31,032,643 In excess of the
first ten years of the gold mining in
dustry in Australia. His statement
follows: !
A remarkable' illustration of the > immense
auriferous wealth of the commonwealth is af
forded by the fact that the value of the Aus
tralian gold production in 1903â Â£16,294.831â
was the largest -yet recorded for any one year,
the next largest output, valve Â£14,812,001. be
ing in the. previous year. The output during
the ten years ending December, 1860, gener
ally . known as Australia's "golden period,"
was Â£106.598,555. â¢ After that year there were
considerable fluctuations in the annual value
Of the production, the lowest amount. Â£4.434.
043 being in ISSG. after which year there wu
a steady UDward tendency, which has since
been maintained and increased by reason of
the West Australian gold discoveries.
Each of the' States has assisted In the work
of gold production, Victoria leading by a con
siderable amount until 1898, when the posi
tion - became occupied by Western Australia,
although the Victorian annual average was
well maintained. The total quantity of gold
raleed in Victoria to the end â¢of 1903 was
66.736,338 ounces, value Â£266.810,711. or more
than half the total value, Â£430,933.018, of the
entire gold production of the commonwealth,
the figures being: Victoria, Â£266,810,711:
Queensland, Â£58,312,127; New South W r ales,
Â£50,924.164; Western Australia. Â£4<3.568,0!>4;
Tasmania, Â£5,440,564, and South Australia,
Â£2,573,357. The most extensive development of
quarts-reeflnjr iÂ« found in Victoria, some of
the mines being of a great depth. At the end
of 1903 there were eight mines in the Bendlgo
district over 3000 feet deep, and fourteen over
2500 feet. In the Victoria mine a depth ot
3750 feet had been reached, and In the T^aza
rus mine, 8424 feet. On other fields there
were six mines over 1500 feet deep, the deeo
est of which were the South Star mine in the
Ballarat district, where the shaft is down
2520 feet, and the North Lone Tunnel mine
in the Walhalla district, where a depth of 2516
feet has been reached. In 1905 gold was ob
tained at a depth of 4224 feet In the New Chum
mine, belnsr the deeDest level yet attained in
any part of the world. In Queensland the
West of Scotland mine; in the Gymple field,
is worked at a depth of 3156 feet, while several
others exceed 2000 feet in depth. Aljuvial min
ing Is extensively carried en in various parts
of the commonwealth, especially In Victoria,
where nuggetg have been obtained ranging In
weight from a little over 190 pounds to over
30 pounds.
According to figures compiled by ,the
Assessor, Shoshone County and . the
State of Idaho will receive from the
mining companies operating in the
Coeur d'Alenes the sum of $114,304 30
as taxes for the current year. The en
tire valuation of the county is $6,
148,000. The levy is fixed at $3 per
$100, which brings the total >taxes to
be paid the county to (184,440, over 60
per cent of which sum is assessed to
the mining companies on their im
provements and net profits. The net
profits for the current year are offi
cially reported at $2, 951,811 60. The
improvements are assessed upon a vaf
uatlon.of $859,333. The highest tax Is
against the Federal Mining and-Smelt
ing Company, amounting t0. 543,844 64.
The United States produces 319.000,000
metric tons of coal a year, worth at the
mines $453,000,000 and costing consumers
nearly $1,000,000,000.

NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Dealings In stocks
expanded to-day and the market broadened
out Into greater animation end strength than
*or a long time past, the sales for the day
rising to a total of 920,700 chares. The dem
onstration wae In the nature of a celebration of
the distinct relaxation of money conditions
and was to a very large extent In the hanJs
or the professional element. Commission
liousee continued to compiam of email busi
ness. The celebration took on a rather riot
ous form during the progress of a series of
sky-rocket , movements In a miscellaneous as
eortcient of f-pecialtles, many of which do not
appear en the tape for months at a tinre.
Practically every stock of this class listed on
the exchange was brought Into the movement
at one time or another. The choice of these
etocks. the majority of which are non-divl
crnfi payers and all of them selling at low
prices, was based on the argument that evi
cent paying railroad clocks require Â« larger
amount of capital to carry them on margin,
thus Increasing tbe burden or speculation dur
ing a period of high money rates. But this
did not discourage the continued attention to
a class of gilt-edged ana high-priced rail
read Etocke, owing to the great facility with
v hlch wide price zcovemecis can be produced
'.:, these stocks, of which the floating market
a^vply Is always very email. The conse
<3^*.nce is that prices may be bid up in fucd
c.-;?es by points or even by fl\-e and ten point
lrterveJs without bringing any offerings,
v here an advance cf % or % in an active mar
ket leader would necessitate the absorption
cf thousands of shares In ' order to hold .the
ftdvanee. The rather incongruous epec^fcclc
was presented, therefore, of coincident move
ments in Standard Rope and Twine. Vulcan
de Tinning, American Grass Twine, American
Hide and Leather ar.d stocks of a like class
vatwd from $1 to $10 a chare and high-prtced
railroad etocks selling at from $200 to over $400
a share, while the body of the list of stand
ard railroad etocks remained comparatively
impaFsive. The usually active railroad stocks
averaged a gain of about a point, however,
the advance occurring mostly after the move
ment In the specialties had proceeded fo# lomo
time and being prompted apparently by a.
realization on the part of the conductors ot
the movement of the Incongruity of the las
erartines* ot the standard crocks. The close at
tention to the money situation was evident
in the prompt response in the market to the
rur.blicatioa of the preliminary estimate of
the week's currency movement, which was
quickly followed by the great spurt of activity
for the day.
The figures pointed to a small addition, on
account of the regular express movement with
the interior, to the large gain of cash by the
banks yielded by the suo-treasury operations
which had contributed to the banks up to '
Thursday evening $4,457,000. The addition of
the regular currency movement promised to
bring the total gain In cash up to about $5.
(jOG.OOO. Discounts were shaded at all three
of the great money center* a-fcroad, and tpecu
lative sentiment was inclined to leap to the
conclusion that the strain of the October Â«et
tlements being 0%-er an early return of ease
in money was to be looaed for. The only
unfavorable factor in the day's money mar
ket was the continued aggressive advance of
sterling exchange in this, market. The an- \u25a0
nouncement of the final payment of $3,000,000
tcr the purchase of the friars' land in the
frllipgines, which calls for the remittance of
Jtst sura from New Yortc, may help to ex
l-ziTL the pereUterst strength this week in
the exchange market. The common supposi
tion, however, points to the ' remittance of
Japanese funds on deposit acre as the prime
factor in exchange. The high tide of the
market's activity was not maintained, and
laet prices were not at all the best, but the
closing â¢ tone was etrong. Bonds were Irregu
lar. Total sales, par %-alue, $3,770,000. U.
8. bonds were all unchanged on call.

New York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 20. â On the frost scare
our market opened from 5 to 12 up, which
was the lowest of the session. The market
was active with good outside buying. Shorts
made a scramble to get under cover. This is
about the earliest date in ten years' for frost.
The spot markets of the South are advancing
sharply with a good demand.
Spot people here were heavy buyers of all
options. The South Is holding this crop, which
will govern future options, as it has done in
the past two seasons. We have had an ad
vance now of about 75 points. ' .
Advices this evening by telegraph from the
South, denoto that the temperature has been
rather v low at some points during the week,
but no damage from frost is reported.
On the whole where rain has fallen the
precipitation has been lighter and moderate.
In a few districts wet weather has interfered
somewhat with the gathering of the crop. From
Mobile It is reported that picking is nearing
completion in that vicinity- and Selma reports
the crop all picked on uplands. :
Dick t>ays: Conservative houses say cotton
should maintain its gain . whether frosts ma
terialize or not, as great difficulty is experi

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Oct., 20.â Strength In the wheat

considerable ' decline . as a .result '\u25a0 of free sell

ber" was unchanged to \u25a0 %c \u25a0_\u25a0 higher : at 86Vi@
86% c. Sentiment In the pit was bearish," owing
to the"' general impression crediting the leading
bull with fairly .large sales through commission
houses. - This view of the situation caused tree
selling by pit traders. For : a time no \u25a0 special
demand was in; evidence,; and inconsequence
pÂ»lces declined,^ December ,: dropping \u25a0 to 85% c.
The leader of the bulls seemed; then: to change

resulted \u25a0\u25a0 in â¢ a â¢ scramble - among ) shorts, '\u25a0:\u25a0. who

Poultry and Game.
Under continued . heavy arrivals and a
rather slack demand,- the Poultry market was
generally weak, notably for live Turkeys and
Ducks, ; which were quoted lower. There was
quite a surplus lying around unsold at the
close. Game was in good request and there
was a general advance In Wild Ducks. \u25a0 Hare,

Batter, Cheese and Eggn.
The feature of the market now Is the scar
city of ranch Eggs. In fact, there are prac
tically none here, and, dealers, can get prac
tically, what they choose to ask for the handful
coming in. They were paying 440 among them
selves, and reselling to retailers at 45c yester
day.-., Of .course this .is a fine condition for
those who have Eastern and cold storage stock
to work oft. Receipts yesterday were the
lightest for ! many months, j as will be seen
below. ' \u25a0
The same remarks apply. largely to Butter,
creamery being closely* cleaned up and very
firm, though prices are , no higher. Cube But
ter. \u25a0 however, has. advanced lc and is being
rushed for all it Is worth.
\u25a0 Cheeso continues f firm; though dealers say
they find trade rather slow owing to the high
prices. Stocks continue very light. â¢ \u25a0
The Dairy Exchange announces that It will
formally open for business November 1.
Receipts were 23,800 lbs Butter, 839 cases

Deddnous. and Citrus Fruits.
With tho usual: Friday dullness ' prevailing,
the general tone of the fruit market was one
of easiness. Grapes were a decidedly weak
feature and there was a general decline in
prices of table varieties. .Small packages were
extremely dull owing to the absence of de
mand for shipment, and large open boxes were
easier under greatly- Increased receipts, par
ticularly of the Tokay, variety. Some fancy
Black FerreraÂ«s in large and small packages
were held for shipment at prices well above
the outside quotations. There was very little
doing in Wine Grapes and prices were largely
nominal. Apples: were again reported easy,
\u25a0with stocks still burdensome. Aside from Per
simmons, the other email : orchard fruits re
mained steady despite the light trading, as
supplies* were limited. There was very little
doing in Melons, and Strawberries, Raspberries
and Blackberries were dull and lower. In the
Citrus market old crop Oranges, ! Lemons and
Grape Fruit ruled firm, while Mexican Limes
were reported weak at the flat ratÂ© of $4 ptr
caw A steamer , which arrived from Mexican
ports on the preceding day. brought over 1000
cases, which accounts for the decline. .

ZEILE RETIRES
FROM POSITION
111 Health- Compels Him to
Resign Presidency of the
3fercaiitile Trust Company
F. W. Zeile resigned the position of
president of the Mercantile Trust Com
pany yesterday at a special meeting of
the directors. N. D. Hideout was chosen
to succeed him. Mr. Zeile, having been
president of the Mercantile Trust Com
pany since its organization and there hav
ing been no intimation of his purpose,
the change in the head of the banking
concern occasioned great surprise and
considerable Inquiry. A story found cur
rency that there' had been some disagree
ment in the board of directors, but this
was promptly denied by Directors E. S.
Pillsbury, Wakelleld Baker, William Bab
cock and by Mr. Zeile himself.
The retirement of Zeile, it was ex
plained, was due only to the poor con
dition of his health. His duties have
taxed his strength 100 greatly. His phy
sicians advised him that unless he, had
rest and took care of himself the conse
quences would be serious. He accord
ingly determined to drop all business
cares as soon as possible, and called the
special meeting of the directors that he
might at once present his resignation.
The directors declared last evening that
the directors at the meeting yesterday
showed their good-will and perfect con
fidence in Mr. Zeile by offering to give
him a vacation for a yeaf, to continue
him in office for that term as president
and to give him {he president's pay while
he was absent. He declined the offer,
however.
Mr. Zeile said last evening that only
the condition of his health had induced
him to retire. He also said that he would
retain his membership in the board of di
rectors.
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SATURDAY, GGTOBER 5 ,21, 1905.
MANAGER A. It. BRIGGS
TO GO TO CHICAGO
Represents Commercial Bodies In Con
vention of Interstate Commerce
Law 'Association.
The Interstate Commerce Law Asso
ciation, which holds its convention in
Chicago the middle of next week, has
asked the different commercial bodies
of the United States to name delegates.
Inasmuch as a" la,te resolution by the
California State Board of Trade is.in
terpreted to mean that delegates are
not permitted to conventions \u25a0\u25a0 outside
the boundaries of the State from .the
board, Arthur R. Briggs, manager -of
that body, has been asked to go as a
delegate to Chicago, representing the
Chamber of Commerce and t the San
Francisco Board of Trade. He leaves
on the 6 ' o'clock overland train tnis
evening, with credentials from these
organizations authorizing him to act.in
the convention in their behalf.
The particular interest that the Cali
fornia organizations feel In ithe delib
erations of this convention will come
from the peculiar feature of whether
the Interstate Commerce^ Commission
shall be Increased in number, giving a
representative to this State, and
whether it will Congress to en
large- the 1 , powers of the commission
to the extent of vesting it with the
right to fix freights and fares for
transcontinental business and to main
tain them until the courts have decided'
otherwise.
The peculiar interest which Mr.
Briggs expresses with respect to the
convention is that whatever is done
will not in any wise affect the devel
opment of our State and coast:inter
ests. State development being of all
'things the matter which to-day inter
ests the minds of public men on this
coast. , , â¢

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Jean Cajet, .with' striking facial re
semblance to . the last '- . Emperor of
France, talked and acted so erratically
in the court of police Judge Mogan,
where he was accused of peace dis
turbance, that there was no other ra
tional' course open to the bench' than
that of sending: him to the Lunacy
Commission for examination. ,
â¢ Mons. Cajet is a chef, and his alleged
peace disturbance consisted of forcing
his way into "the culinary department
of Felix's Parisian Restaurant on Cali
fornia street, and there assailing the
gentleman in charge. After delivering
himself .of much vituperation -and
fiercely resisting ejectment :by .the
cooking corps he climaxed' his offen
slveness by picking up a mallard duck,
trussed and ready for the spit, and
utilizing it as a weapon with which to
beat off his opponents. The duck was
spoiled.^ N
"Sacre "' he exclaimed, after impa
tiently listening to the foregoing re-
countal of his' misdeeds, contributed
by several witnesses,* "eet eez . ze

Various attorneys have opined, that
color blindness is the only, plea ad
missible In behalf of Mrs.' .Laura J.
Harris, a comely white matron who
abandoned her , white ;,husband , and
three white children at Ukiah'and fled
to ,this , city with Robert Pankie, a
young negro barber.
When the. police found the , woman in
an apartment from which her dusky
traveling companion had just -departed
she kissed his tintype, pressed it to
her heart and declared he was sole
custodian of her affection. Therefore
her legal champion, Arthur. Mack* has
been urged by his brethren in . law- to
rely upon the -argument '. ; t that'. she is
unable to distinguish black; from white,
as it is about the only defense. she can
offer' that would lighten thevhldeous
ness of her, confession, although it
would not make cohdohable. her deser
tion of Mr. Harris and the offspring.
Mr. Harris is a". vitlculturist at Ukiah,
and when: his wife told -him she would
like to convey to' her mother at Santa
Rosa a : : large box of choice, grapes he
packed j the fruit, hoped she would, en
joy her visit? to the old home and ;theri
resumed- 7 work in :his -vineyard. When
he; returned,hom'e f for, dinner he' found
that- the grapes ' had been emptied" from
the box and the box utilized as al trunk
by his missing half,; who was
absent, and < when he discovered that
the village tonsori also ;had abrupt
ly, disappeared he- noted the coincidence
and at. onco* started > an .investigation,
which confirmed his worst fear. ;
No troubled was experienced in track
ing the elopers to; this city ; . and at; 1
o'clock yesterday morning "Patrolmen
\u25a0Brady and Phal found; the woman ! in : a
lodging-house'; at 308 ; . Sutter^i, street;
which her sable. escort had rented --and;
of which ho ; had "evldently-been "a- joint"
occupant. 'Twas^ then she> kissed the
tintype and confessed her shameful in
fatuation. T^^^l ' "..\u25a0'. \u25a0\u25a0 * -

listlessly : awaiting} reopening â¢: :of ; the
milk * adulteration ; case 'fl the - door ,; of
that tribunal suddenly opened. Bailiff
*'Con" Donohue appeared framed there
in, abruptly' shouted "Fire!" and in
stantly began coughing,, the force of
the ejaculation having evidently irri
tated his vocal apparatus.
In an Instant all was uproar. If a
bomb had unexpectedly exploded amid
the loungers it could not have stirred
them, to action more quickly than did
that single cry of "Fire!" "Where's
the blaze?" yelled some, and "Where's
the hose?" howled others, while men
ran hither and yon and the bailiff
continued coughing. . . .
"Is the Judge safe?" one \u25a0 excited
dairyman aueried.
"Get the smoke out of your lungs
quick and, tell us where : the flames
are!" roared a small. boy, dancing Im
patiently before the spluttering officer.
"Fire â Joseph '. Fire â come into
court!" was the response, huskily de
livered,' and the chafing crowd fell
back disgustedly.
Joseph Fire was charged with hav
ing stolen $35 from Mrs. Sophie Gold
stein .while he' was engaged In alter
cation with her on Folsom street. She
swore that in the heat of argument
she dropped the money and he picked
it up and' he countered by. declaring
that she had never been the possessor
at any one (time of such, a vast amount
of cash as $35.. Incidentally he ac
cused her of having scratched his face.
The hearing was then sidetracked to

The cry* of "Fire!" created a commo
tion within the court hardly Inferior
to that in the corridor. Clerk "Bar
ney. Conlon displayed rare presence of
mind by hastening to the Judge's
chamber and emerging itherefrom a
moment later with an attorney's hat
filled with water. â¢ His Honor, who
happened 'to be taking snuff when the
alarm was sprung, requested the court
stenographer to ascertain by sniffing
the source of the Invisible smoke.
Clerk Conlon did not emp,ty the hat of
its contents until a lady witness who
displayed premonitory symptoms of
swooning had regained her composure.
: Judge Mogan committed William
O'Doherty for trial in the Superior
Court on the charge of assault to do
great bodily harm by hurling his 1
months old babe against a wall and
fracturing its right hip, his provoca
tion for the inhuman act being the dis
turbance'of his, sodden slumber by thÂ«
little one's wailing. His ball was set
at $5000 and he Is In* jail. The infant's
right leg Is Irreparably maimed. Thir
teen-year-old Catherine; O'Doherty waa
the principal witness against her
father. ' ; < " .
:\u25a0 Bernard Duffy and . Thomas Fltzpat

by accusing them of. a burglary which
was committed the same night at East

they declared that they merely said he
had accidentally allowed -the child to
slip .from his arms , while he was en
deavoring to hush it to sleep, and when
