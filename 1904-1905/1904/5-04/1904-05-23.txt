WILL ESTABLISH COLONY
OF NEW YORK HEBREWS
NEW YORK, May 22.â Rev. Dr. L.
Zinsler, president of the Free Loan As
sociation of Manhattan and of the
Utopia Land Company, who bought for
$200,000 a tract of 170 acres between
Flushing and Jamaica, has planned th*?
establishment at that point of a large
colony of east side Jews. There are
2400 building lots in the purchase.. It is
the idea of Dr. Zinsler to solve the so
called easf side problem by giving the
working people of that congested
neighborhood an opportunity of buy
ing lots at a low price, say an average
of $200 each, and help will be given
them to put up moderate priced cot
tages.
. The Free Loan Association has loaned
east side Jews $100,000 at low rates of
interest.

Running into the door of a tene

halted by shouts from the chauffeur.
He turned to see a half-dozen men
and boys endeavoring to climb Into
the automobile and reach the side of
his wife. The crowd about the auto
mobile had evidently caught sight of
the jewels worn by. Mrs. Gotshall and
tried to reach- them. Shouts from
Gotshall as he came running- toward
the machine frightened them away,
but a few of the older ones remained
to bar his progress. He pushed them
aside, and, jumping Into the automo
bile, ordered the chauffeur to make
rapid speed. The automobile was
pursued by the hoodlums until it out
ran them.
NEW YORK, May 22. â Struck by a

there were sullen mutterlngs from the
crowd when the automobile neared
the middle of the block between First

Dr. -Bucklin holds that it takes six
years to tell- whether the cure is com
plete or not.
Dr. Bucklin has undertaken a
paper to be read before the County
Medical Society next fall, to give pro
fessors the benefit of his researches.
He does not claim absolutely that he
has discovered a "cure." He does
profess that his operation has bene
fited nineteen cases of advanced
tuberculosis.
One operated upon In 1902 had had
twenty-five hemorrhages and seemed
to be near death's door. After the
operation, -which "raised hi3 altitude
5.4 miles." his bronchitis ceased In a
Week, and in five months he had
gained twenty-two pounds.
-\EW YORK, May 22. â Dr. Charles
Aubrey Bucklin of this city has a
new cure for consumption. His tuber
culosis patients stay in New York,
yet they breathe the atmosphere of
the Rocky Mountain plateaus and
gain weight.
Dr. Bucklin claims that all that is
necessary is to have the prominent
lower turbinated bones removed.
They are close to the outer surface
of each of the nostrils. The turbinated
bone Is about one and a half inches
long and may be as thin as a lead
pencil. Taking out the bone Increases
the faculty of breathing.
The bones are removed with a saw.
The operation is nearly painless and
the wound heals quickly. The con
sumptive begins to take on weight
almost immediately.
Dr. Bucklin explains the theory of
this operation by means of a machine
called the respirometer, which meas
ures the relative change In altitude ef
fected by the operation. He cites the
oases of several patients cured, or. as
he says, "apparently on the road to a
complete cure," through this simple
operation.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
telegraphy on this coast has !
proved to be a complete success as was i
"cemor.srrated by the transmission of j
messages between the station on the j
top at Yerba Buer.a Island and the i
steamer Solace when the vessel was \
Ksventy^-dx miles cut at sea. The
r.avy transport Solace sailed from port
Saturday morning en route to the Ori
t Dtl She -w as fully equipped with the
system. From the moment
j-he leit the heads she commenced send
ing telegraphs to the island. The com
. mnnlotiOB bÂ«tweÂ«o the two points was
absolutely perfect. At 8 o'clock in the
evening the tk-iace sent the following I
â¢jjcstjon to the island: "Will ,. .you i
kindly give us the result of the base- j
ball score of the game played to-day
on the lilar.d between the navy ap
prentices and the commercial nine-"
The lolloping answer was immediately
j sent back and was understood and ac
knowledged by the Solace: "The com
mercial ream won by a. score. of 6 to 4."
â¢ At 9 o'clock Commander Bull of the
Solace sent the following communica
tion to Admiral William H. Whiting.
' corrmandant at the island: "We are
now seventy-six miles from the Golden
Gate. We have communicated suc
cetafuUy with Farallone Islands. We
are using full power and can hardly
hear you. Good-by."
ADMIRAL WHITING SATISFIED.
Admiral' Whiting, who had charge of
the 'construction of the station at Yerba
liuena, is greatly pleased at the suc
cess of the new invention. It has taken
sonie time to construct the station, but j
it tiiig been in good working order for i
tHe last two weeks. Mare Island has I
been â¢ very frequently communicated !
"-with. Since it commenced operations â¢
ft has never been closed night or day. '
ar.d an operator is always there ready I
lo receive communications either from
* points about the bay or from the deep- i
sta-guing vessels. Admiral Whiting, !
in .speaking of the result cr the experi- i
nrat, said:
Tt # oan be readily understood that I j
am greatly pleased at the magnificent j
-. results of this trial. It has exceeded
anything that has heretofore taken j
place tjn the Pacific Coast. The com- j
munication was distinct, and the regis- j
tratior.s were absolutely perfect- There |
* v.an not the slightest trouoie in under- j
â¢fcta-njiing the communications. The ma- j
<)iine we are using is the Slaby-Arco.
â¢With thts instrument, which has been
greatly improved since the Navy De- j
paftment took hold of it, we can send i
rijspatches to and communicate with i
any system of instruments used in j
-wireless telegraphy. This is where we I
have the advantage over the Marconi j
machine.' The greatest distance that
' baa yet been observed in this country
en the Atlantic Coast is 112 miles. The
me'ssage was sent out from Navesink
no some vessel out at sea- The Xan
tucket lightship has been able to com
municate with a vessel at sea at a dis
tance o-f 100 miles. If we could have a
station^ somewhere at Point Bonita,
Vith the instruments we are now using,
Â»e would not have the slightest diffi
culty in communicating with a vessel
Stf miles off this coast. As it stands
row the tall buildings of San Francisco
â¢or steel structure naturally interfere
Â¦rttfr the transmission, but notwith
t landing this the work of Saturday
has proved an unqualified success."
: 'The United States cruiser Boston is
t-hortly due from Panama, and we nat
urally are waiting with much expec
tancy to see the results of communica
tion, with her. as she is fitted with a
â¢ wireless machine. In the experiments !
in this line of communications

WASHINGTON, May 22.â Naval of
ficers, in view of the recent heavy
losses of naval vessel3 through the ex
plosion of mines near Port Arthur, sug
gest â¢ that the subject of regulating
the use of such mines j by international
agreement may come up at the next
meeting of the naval board for consid
eration. The movers in thlS" matter are
looking to the protection of the vessels
of neutral navies and merchant ships
rather than the vessels of belligerents.
Recent advices are to the effect that
under the influence of the tremendous
tides that ebb and flow in the Gulf of
Pcchili submarine mines cannot safely
be anchored except in shallow- water.
They are torn away from their moor
ings and drift off with the tide, consti
tuting a menace to neutral ships.
It is believed in naval circles that
this matter ultimately will be brought
to the attention of The Hague tribunal.

"I am informed on good 'authority

"Addressing a meeting of financiers
to-day on the importance of securing
the sympathy of the civilized world in
the present momentous crisis. Marquis
Ito strongly urged the importance of
Japan being contented to enforce her
legitimate claim?, never for a moment
wavering in a frank and broad-minded
recognition of the legitimate claims and
interests of other nations. This speech
is considered sifmiflcant as foreshad
owing Japan's future policy with re
gard to Manchuria and Korea,"
A dispatch from St. Petersburg to
Reuter's Telegram Company says that
the report of a sortie by the Port Ar
thur garrison h.as not been confirmed.
It appears, says the dispatch, to have
originated ln the receipt of Lieutenant
General Stoessel's report of the fight at
Kir.ehcu. This, together with the fact
that General Stoessel commands at
Port Arthur, grave rise to the rumor
that the garrison had made a sortie.
The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Daily Telegraph says:
â¢Realizing that they were isolated,
the Port Arthur Russians made their
desperation an excuse for sowing the
.whole Gulf of Pechlli with floating
"blockade mines. It is reported that
they sent launches and junks to drop
mines in the paths of the Japanese
v.-arehips and transports. The mines
drifted to the high seas and to Chinese
.waters, constituting the gravest dan
ger to neutral shipping. Yestreday the
Ualnrun passed two floating mines
within six miles ' of "Weihaiwei. Even
a? the act of a desperate garrison, this
must be in violation of the law of na
tions."
' The Standard's correspondent at To
]<io, telegraphing under date of May 21,
eays:
Â¦ LONDON. May 23.â The correspond
ent of the Daily Mail at Kobe, Japan,
cables the following:
â¢ "Returning from Korea through the
Yellow Sea this (last) week, I saw
Japanese transports in every direction.
They were traveling without escort.
Sometimes es many as ten at a time
were counted." .
The correspondent of the Times on
board that paper's steamship Halmun,
which is still excluded from the 'real
theater of war, gives a review of the
present position of affairs and says:
"Reserves from Japan are being
"brought to reinforce General Kuroki's
line of communication, which is being
harassed by Cossacks. General Kuroki
appears to be waiting for the landing
and co-operation of a third army. It

'"Our patrols and cavalry detach

cover their dispositions by small ad
vance guards, consisting of as much
as a regiment of infantry, with artil
lery and- cavalry posted along the high
roads, and as little as two companies
at important points. Japanese cavalry
is seldom seen.
"From reports received yesterday I
have concluded that the first Japanese
army is concentrated as follows: Two

environs and one division at Habalin,

*"To-day, in the presence of all the

Faint Spells
Are very often attributed to biliousness

That's wrong.
Faint spells are often accompanied by
biliousness, but you will also notice
shortness of hreath. asthmatic breathing,
oppressed foelins in chest, weak or hun-

of heart weakness. â¢
Don't make thn mistake of treating the

who Â»s still detained by the military
in Telluride, Vice President J. C. Wil
liams of Grass Valley, California, will
preside over the gathering, which will
be in session ten days.
Perhaps the most important matter
to be discussed will be the question of
open meetings of local lodges affiliated
with the federation. For years. It is
claimed, detectives have either joined
the unions themselves, disguised as
miners, or have sent miners into the
meetings to see what has been going
on, and in this way learning the work
of the organization. In order to pre
vent this the executive committee has
decided to recommend to the conven
tion that meetings of local unions
hereafter be open to all who choose tor
attend.
DENVER, May 22. â To-morrow will
mark the opening of the twelfth annual
convention of the Western Federation
oi Miners. This will probably be the.
most important convention ever held:
by the organization.
More than 250 delegates, representing
locals scattered throughout Colorado.
Arizona, British Columbia, Montana,
Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan,
New Mexico, California, Oregon, Utah,
South Dakota, Washington, Wyoming
and Alabama will be in attendance.
TANGIER, Morocco. May 22.â The
Shereef cf Wazan left this morning to

powered the Shereef to say that the
Government will grant all of the de
mands of Ralssouli if Ion Perdicaris,
the American, and Cromwell Variley,
the British captive, are handed over
immediately. The soldiers already
have been withdrawn from the dis
tricts where the bandits are located.
WASHINGTON, May 22.âNegotia
tions for the ransom of Ion Perdicaris
and his stepson. Cromwell Variley,
'have been opened by the bandit chief
tain Raissouli.
American Consul Gummere at Tan
gieri in a cablegram received at the
State Department this afternoon, re
ports that Raissouli has communicated
with the authorities in Tangier and
that a message has been received from
the captives stating that they were
well treated". Gummere does not say
what, If any, figure of ransom Rais
souli demands, but the bandit intimated
that he expected an offer to be made
quickly for the release of the cap
tives.
A line of communication between the
authorities and the mountains where
the bandits are supposed to be con
cealed has evidently been established.

PORTLAND. Or., May 22. â The of
ficial call of the seventh annual ses
sion of the American Mining Congress
has been issued by Secretary Ir'win
Mahon. The congress, which will
meet in this city August 22, is ex
pected to draw a large attendance,
not only from constantly increasing
interest in mining, but because of the
scenic beauties of this State and the
perfect climatic conditions prevailing
here during the summer. The dele
gates are to be entertained by excur
sions which will enable them to view
the beautiful scenery in the vicinity
and every effort will be made by Port
land to give them a royal welcome.
Many questions of national interest
will be acted upon during the session
and the benefit to be derived from the
Lewis and Clark Exposition will be
discussed. There will also be an ef
fort to establish permanent national
headquarters for the American Min
ing Congress.
Addresses will be delivered by men
of national reputation and especial at
tention will be given to the discus
sion of the subjects of "The Relation
of Mining to the Industrial Develop
ment of our Country" and "The Crea
tion of a Department of Mines and
Mining by Our Government."
This latter question has long been
agitated and for several years great
influence has been brought to bear
upon the President and Congress to
authorize the establishment of such a
department, but so far without avail.
RENO, Nev., May 22. â Lost on the
great Tonopah desert for two days,
without food or water, either for him
self or his horse, almost exhausted
from thirst and\hunger and about to
give up all hope of escaping alive â
such was the condition of Carl Stod
dard, one of Nevada's best known
metallurgists.
He left Tonopa^i early last week,
riding a horse, and bound for Reno
on a visit to his parents. Some miles
out he became bewildered, lost the
road, and for the next two days was
lost upon the desert. It was yesterday
morning when an Indian prospector
found him. Stoddard was out of his
mind. He was leading his horse and
walking about in an aimless manner.
Every few steps he would fall to the
ground, but he would not give up,
and continued until at last he fell into
his rescuer's arms and was carried
to Gardnerville, where medical assist
ance succeeded In reviving him suf
ficiently to allow his friends to bring
him to Reno. He arrived here to
night, weak and exhausted, but will
recover.
The distance from here to Tonopah
is not more than 300 miles, yet Stod
dard covered 450 miles of the most
barren country in Nevada.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Nearly all of the Bishops filled pul
pits to-day, either at the morning or
evening services, in this city and In
near-by towns.
While Monday, May 30. is the date
set for final adjournment of the con
ference, it Is believed that practically
all the important business will be com
pleted before the end of the present
week. Some of the delegates have left
for home already, and so many more
were seeking to be excused that the
conference became alarmed yesterday
lest the quorum would be broken and
made a rule to refuse further applica
tions for leave until a special commit
tee shall pass upon them.
Two subjects will doubtless cause a
spirited , debate during the next few
days, namely, the amusement question
and the relations of capital and labor.
The latter was made the subject of a
special report from the judiciary com
mittee last week. In which vigorous de
nunciation is made of "the greed of
corporations and their indifference to
the welfare of their employes." It was
sought to have the conference pa3s the
resolutions reported by the judiciary
committee as the expression of the
body, but strong opposition developed,
and it was made the special order for
Tuesday morning, when it will be dis
cussed.
LOS ANGELES. May 22.â It is unof
ficially stated to-day that the ballot
taken by the Methodist General Con
ference Saturday for missionary Bish
ops, the result of which will be an
nounced officially Monday morning, has
resulted in the election of Dr. I. B.
Scott of Louisiana (colored) as mis
sionary BIshOD to Africa and j Dr. W.
F. Oldham and Dr. K. E. Robinson as
additional missionary Bishops In South
ern Asia. Dr. Scott's election caused
some surprise, as it was thought that
Dr. Camphor of Liberia would be the
successful candidate.
COLUMBUS, O., May 22.â There are
more early visitors here than usual for
the Democratic convention next Tues
day and "Wednesday. This is due to
contests In many county delegations
and the desire of contestants "to be
heard"* as soon as they can meet dele
gates and leaders.
There have been fights in most of
the 88 counties for Hearst delegates.
All who are opposed to Hearst are
called Conservatives. As the latter
have a majority of uncontested dele
gates, titey will no doubt decide the
contests against the Hearst contes
tants and control the convention. The
Conservatives, however, are divided in
their political preferences between Col
onel James Kilbourne of Columbus,
who was the Democratic candidate for
Governor three years ago; Judge Jud
son Harmon, who was Attorney Gen
eral under President Cleveland, and
Joseph Folk of Missouri.
Previous to his defeat for Governor
last year and his loss of control of the
State committee this year, Mayor Term
L. Johnson of Cleveland was considered
a candidate for the Democratic nomi
nation for President, but he Is now
heading the boom in Ohio for Folk.
Johnson, who was the candidate for
Governor last year, and John H.
Clarke, who was then the Democratic
candidate for Senator against Hanna,
are delegates from the Twenty-flrst
Ohio district to the St. Louis conven
tion, and neither has been mentioned
for delegate at large. There was a
proposition to make the last four Dem
ocratic candidates for Governor,
Horace Chapman, Jonn McLean,
James Kilbourne and Tom L. Johnson,
the delegates at large, but all declined.
Chapman. McLean and Kilbourne also
declined to serve as district delegates.
There Is no doubt that the Conserva
tives will name the "Big Four" and the
State ticket, as well as dictate the
resolutions. No Instructions for any
candidate are expected, but either Kil
bourne or Harmon will be indorsed as
"the Ohio favorite," and the delegates
will be instructed to "vote as a unit
whenever a majority of the delegation
so elects."
ST. LOUIS, May 22.â When Joseph
W. Folk was asked to-night whether he
was In sympathy with Tom L. John
son's proposition to secure the Indorse
ment of Ohio for President, the Circuit
Attorney said:
"As I said a few weeks ago, I am
under obligation to the people of Mis
souri; this obligation Is so definite that
I cannot consider the nomination or
even the suggestion for any office other
than that of Governor of Missouri, for
which high place the rank and file of
the people in my party have so gener
ously conferred on me."

If, he said, it was true that drink
ing on the part of women exists and
!â¢ growing as described, then the time
would come when it would be neces
sary to give the temperance pledge to
girls as well as to boys.
Archbishop Montgomery called
on the conftrmed boys to stand and
give a pledge of temperance to be
kept until they shall reach the age
of 21.
The following were confirmed:
BOYS CONFIRMED.
One of the old women told how she
lost $75 on one day. but made it up
the next day.
Such a condition, said his Grace, is
a blot on society. Betting is not a
legitimate way to make money, but is
a degradation both to body and soul.
His Grace gave an Illustration of
two old women on a boat while cross
ing the bay, 6peak of their losses and
winnings at the races.
At St. Mary's Cathedral there was a
large class confirmed by Archbishop
Montgomery yesterday afternoon, and
in the course of his address to the
boys and girls his Grace spoke of the
power of. prayer and advised his hear
ers against carelessness in the observ
ance of their religious obligation.
The Archbishop, in laying before
the boys the evil effects and the con
ditions that arise from intemperance,
sa.id that he had read in the press of
a growing intemperance among wom
en, and especially, he understood, was
it the case among women of leisure.
If such were true, lie said, of condi
tions in San Francisco, then it was
time to blot it out.

sinking spells, was weak, lacked energy
end often felt as if I would totally col-

Doan's Kidney Pills when I first com-

Oakland Deaths.
OAKLAND, May 22. â Friends of
Archie Jeffreys, an Iron molder of San
Francisco, who disappeared a month
ago from the Receiving Hospital in
this city under peculiar circumstances,
fear that his body Is the one found
Thursday on the Peter Thompson i
ranch near Lafayette.
Efforts will be made at once to de
termine definitely whether the decom
posed remains at the Morgue at Mar
tinez can be identified. The body was
found lying on the ground with a rifle
near it and In such a position as to in
dicate that the weapon had either
been used for suicide or had been
accidentally discharged. Jeffreys came
to Oakland four weeks ago and cut
his throat in an attempt to commit
suicide.
The wound was merely superficial.
After it was dressed at the Receiving
Hospital Jeffreys was put to bed. He
appeared to be slightly demented. In
the night time he left the Institution
and has not been seen by his friends
to this day. Members of the Order of
Odd Fellows have taken charge of the
inquiry. r -'A/' ; ;. .-;Â¦
Friends of Missing Iron 3Iolder of
Opinion That Remains Found Near
Lafayette Are His.
FEAR UNIDENTIFIED BODY
MAY BE THAT OF JEFFREYS
The Realty, Bond and Finance
Company reports an excellent week
and many sales of residence property,
and J. H. Macdonald & Co. report
many inquiries for improved and un
improved property in Berkeley and
Alameda, as well as in Oakland.
Conditions in Fruitvale real estate are bet
ter than they have ever been before, and tnli
year will see a larger growth in this part
of Alameda County than has ever before been
known The increase of railroad facilities
with this point has resulted already In an
Increased demand for homes, and many of
the homeseekers are securing property in this
vicinity. The improvement of Oakland s water
front and the consequent increase in business
will also prove a good thing for the real
estate business in general, and there is no
doubt that Fruitvale will receive Its full share
of the general prosperity.
The resource* of this city have almoat treb
led within the last two years and prospective
Investors and owners of real estate In Oalc
land feel confident that the present values are
â¢ecure from the fluctuations so often noticeable
in other cities. Teople outside of Oakland are
beginning to notice, and to talk about this
city, and thtÂ» in turn is attracUmr new capi
tal and new people. This condition Is one
that affords the greatest possible satisfaction
to Property owners and real estate dealers
alike for it proves that outsiders are waking
up to the Possibilities of Oakland real estate
as an investment, and also that the people
of Oakland are awakenins to the Importance
of. their home city.
W. E. Rudell, a prominent dealer
In Fruitvale real estate, said to-day:
Local real estate dealers are well
satisfied with the condition of the
market and expect the year to be one
of the best in the history of Oakland.
William J. Laymance of the Laymance
Real Estate Company says:
DEALERS ARE SATISFIED.
The most important of these new
structures is the # four-story brick
building which is" to be erected on
the northwest corner of Twelfth and
Harrison streets, on the site of the
old Club stables. The lower floor of
this building will be devoted to stores
and the three upper floors will be oc
cupied by the Polytechnic Business
College. The dimensions of this new
structure will be 95x95 feet. The
work of excavating for the founda
tions has already been commenced.
Another project which is of great
importance to this city is the proposed
erection of a large tourist hotel at
the corner of Twentieth street and Tele
graph avenue. Plans for the building
have been submitted to the Oakland
Board of Trade by Mrs. Isabella Rich
ards, who proposes to build the hotel,
and the approval of the board ia re
quested for the proposition. The
property on which it is proposed to
erect the hotel is 200 feet square and
is owned Jointly by Dr. W. D. Hunt
ington and Dr. R. T. Stratton.
Several other new buildings are in
course of construction in other parts
of the city and among them are two
which are being erected at Twenty
third avenue by the California Bank,
and a number of homes which are to
be put up on the tract at the head of
Twenty-third avenue, which is owned
by the heirs of Mrs. Sarah Wakefleld.
The Oakland Water Front Company
is bulkheading a portion of its prop
erty at the west of the entrance to
Lake Merritt, preparatory to filling It
In as a site for factories and manu
facturing plants." The Increasing de
mands for sites of this kind make it
imperative that more space be secured
at an early date.
A steady, healthy activity in Oak
land real estate has marked the last
week, and from the reports of dealers
in Alameda, Fruitvale and Berkeley
the same conditions have prevailed in
those places. The summer market
has now fairly opened and everything
indicates that, while there is in no
sense a boom, this year will be one
of the best ever known in the history
of the city.
The next three months will witness
a great change in the business portion
of the city and where at present the
commercial center is practically con
fined within the district bounded by
Seventh and Fourteenth and Franklin
and Clay streets, by the end of Sep
tember several large business struc
tures will be erected or in course of
erection well outside these limits.

OAKLAND, May. 22. â The voters of
Alameda County are registering so
slowly that County Clerk J. P. Cook
has visited every section of the county
with a force of -deputies for the pur
pose of giving those who live in the
interior a chance to get on the Great
Register without being compelled to
come to the county seat. This has
proved a help to those living In the
interior, but even with all of this work
only about 60 per cent of the voters
in the interior have registered, while
in Oakland less than 20 per cent have
placed their names so that they can
vote this fall.
The last Great Register has been
canceled and every one who wishes
to vote this fall will have to take the
oath anew before, a Deputy County
Clerk. Mr. Cook announces that he
will mail a notice to every voter, in
the canceled Great Register, and, be
ginning with June 15, the County
Clerk's offlce "will be kept open every
evening from 7 until 9 o'clock.

ALAMEDA. May 22.â Hans P. Nell
son and his daughter, Augusta, of this
city while climbing the Redwood Can
yon road in an automobile this morn
ing were toppled over a steep gulch
through the breaking down and back
ing uo of the machine.
Miss Neilson landed on a shelf in the
bank ten feet below the road, and her
father was hurled forty feet farther to
ward .the bottom of the canyon. He
Vent over with the machine, and how
he was not killed he is unable to ex
plain. After turning two somersaults
in the automobile Neilson brought up
against a wire fence, which cut into \
his right shoulder and loft leg and pre
vented him being precipitated fifty feet
more over a sheer brink. The machin
ery of the automobile continued to run
"after capsizing and wrecked the vehicle
so that it will practically have to be
rebuilt.
Miss Ncilson escaped with a few
bruises, and her father attributes this
'to the presence of mind displayed by
the young woman when the automobile
became unmanageable and started to
back x>ver the precipice. " Just as the
machine reached the edge of the em
bankment Miss Neilson jumped from |
the seat. She quickly recovered herself
and bravely went down into the gulch
to the assistance of her father. He was
junable to move for a time, but soon re
covered from the shock and made his
way up the incline to the road. Several
farmers living near by were notified of
the accident, and after providing for
Neilson and his daughter pulled the
demolished automobile out of the gulch
and loaded it on a wagon. In relating
his experience Neilson said:
My ilau^htpr and I started from Alameda In
my 'automobile, which is a light machine cf
five horsepower. \\> intended to go over Into
lU'dwood Canyon, whrre I was to repair a
.Kieam enjrine. We tcok the Redwood road
."nnd were goin* alone well until we passed the
Uc^hmer place, back of Laundry farm, and
struck what is known as the "Clue road."
There is u. very euep grade there and the
road Is narrow. The automobile slowed down
considerable, but It se*mÂ«i that it would be
s-tronir enough to clior.b the Incline. As we
nearÂ»-<l the top the acentric slipped and the
â¢machine befraii to run backward. I applied
thÂ«- brake, but this would not hold. 1 then
Â«>n^-:avoreÂ«i to =t?er ihe marhlne Into the bank,
but could not control it. When I Faff that the
automobile was certain to plunge over the
grade I ordered my daughter to jump. I
staxed with the automobile, and together we
tarried ovt twice U-fore coming to a stop
flay fert dewn the canyon. I could hear and
!Â»ri the machinery buzzing around me, and
feared there would be an txplosion.
V.Tien the machinery stopped running, after
rlprlne itÂ« insides out. I polled myself clear
or the wreckage. I wa* then lying a*?alnst a
I Â»rb-w ire f .nee and the barbs had cut through
my heavy suit and into my right arm. My
light leg vras also injured and it was only
with th<? h*lp of my daughter that I managed
to reach t*e road. Had the eccentric not
â¢Â¦lipped I do not think the accident would
have happened, a* I ara satisfied that the
automobile wag powerful enough to have
<-l!mbed to the top of the grade.
Neilson is a machinist with a shop
here, and is regarded as an expert me
chanic.

WASHINGTON, May 22.â The De
partment of Agriculture has issued a
report on "The Nation's Farm Sur
plus," prepared by George K. Holmes,
chief of the division of foreign markets.
It gives $4,500,000,000 as a conservative
estimate of the value of the farm pro
ducts of this country not fed to live
stock in 1903, on the basis of the cen
sus valuation. The value of the ex
ported farm products of this country
was in 1903 5878,479,451, and the highest
value reached during the last eleven
years was $951,628,331 in 1901, due
chiefly to cotton. The value of , the
exported farm products of this coun
try is concentrated mostly in a few
principal products. Of it in 1903 cot
ton constituted 36 per cent, grain and
grain products 25 per cent, meat and
meat products and live animals 24 per
cent, these products equaling over 85
per cent of the exports of farm pro
ducts last year.
Adding tobacco, whose exports were
valued at over $35,000,000, oil cake and
oil cake meal. $19,839,279, fruits and
nuts . over $18,000,000, and vegetable oils
over $16,000,000, gives a total of eight
classes of products, each with an ex
port value of over $10,000,000, that com
prise almost; 96 per cent of the, farm
exports of 1903.
The fraction of the wheat crop ex-
Department of Agriculture
Prepares Report on the
Excess of Year's Products
ported in the last dozen years has been
about 31 to 41 per cent, and the ex
ported wheat and wheat flour have
yearly averaged somewhat more than
200,000,000 bushels since 1897.
Only a small portion of the corn crop
is exported, as corn, the highest per
centage, 1J. per cent, being for 1898.
Notwithstanding the small percentage,
the exported bushels reach 100,000,000 to
200.000,000. The beef exports weighed
385,000,000, pork exports 551,000,000, lard
exports weighed 490,000,000, oleo oil ex
ports 126,000,000 pounds and tobacco
368,000,000. Butter and cheese exports
have decidedly declined within two or
three years. â
Taking up the destinations of the sur
plus, the report says the United King
dom takes about one-half, Germany
about one-sixth and France, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Canada and
Italy from 3 to 5 per cent each.
To-morrow morning 1 the glee club of
the University of California will start
on its 5000-mile tour of the East, plans
for which have been maturing for a

Mexico. Colorado and then in places
eastward on the way to Chicago. From
Chicago they will go to St. Louis, where
a series of concerts will be given in the
California State building at the World's
Fair under the auspices of the Califor
nia Promotion Committee. The entire
trip will occupy six weeks. The club
will be composed of the following: First

The body was taken in charge by the
Coroner. Paris was 62 years old, a na
tive of France and was a widower.
He resided with a daughter, Mrs.
Croon, at 1571 Filbert street.
Eugene Paris, an aged winemaker
formerly of Livermore, died at the Re
ceiving Hospital at 4 o'clock this morn
ing; from injuries he sustained by being
struck by a Seventh-street local train
last night at the Webster-street cross
ing.
The old man was walking across the
him. Paris acted as if he did not see
or hear the, puff ing locomotive.
At the hospital, where the injured
man was speedily removed, his injuries
were examined by Dr. Emerson and
pronounced fatal. Besides fractures of
three ribs, right arm and right leg
with a dislocation of the right shoulder
there were internal injuries which
must have ended the sufferer's life.

deterioration Js a constant source of wor-

people are readily deceived by 'fake'
hair restoratives. The wish that a hair
preparation will fill the bill' is father
to the fancy that it is likely to do so.
A rare case in point is that of New-

The torpedo boat Tingey, the con
tract, for the building of -which was
signed October 1, 1898, has at last
been completed and accepted by the
Navy Department' The boat was to
have been completed by October,
1899, but the builders failed, and for
upward of four years no' work was
done on the boat. She was 64 per
cent completed in October, 1901, and
remained at that stage until Decem
ber, 1902, when the bondsmen for .the
defunct- firm concluded to complete
the craft. The contract price of
$168,000 would barely cover the
penalties - for Â¦ non-delivery on time,
but It is not probable that the Govern
ment will depart from its usual prac
tice of remitting penalties.
There are four more torpedo boats
contracted for years ago .still incom
pleted. The Goldsborough was con
tracted for July 30. 1897, to be com
pleted January , 30, 1899. After nu
merous breakdowns of the machinery
and accidents to the boat, the builders
despaired of completing the boat and
the Government â¢ has had the boat ' In
hand for over two years, making but
slight progress. The. unfortunate ves
sel has .remained stationary at 99 per
cent j completion "Â¦ since October, 1902.
The Stringham, having repeatedly
The United States collier Nanshan
has made a record in putting on board
the battleship Kentucky 1480 tons of
coal in ten hours by winch work. The
best hour's work was 187 tons, and the
coal was ' taken from the hold,
no extra preparations having been
made, such as getting, a lot on deck
in order to make a record. One and
a half hours were lost owing to an
accident to one of the men working
in the main hold. The coaling took
place in Hongkong harbor in February
last.
The Austrian battleship -. Erzherzog
Friedrich, laid down at Trieste In Jan
uary, 1902, was launched on April 30
last. She is of the same displacement
as the Oregon class In the United
States navy, a type and size which is
favored by many naval experts In pre
ference to the huge and costly battle
ships now building.. The Erzherzog
Friedrich is 390 feet 6 inches in length,
72 feet. 3 Inches breadth and, displaces
10,430 tons on" a mean draught of 24 feet
6 inches. The armament will consist
of four 9.45-inch .guns in turrets of 8.27
inches thickness; eight 7.5-inch guns in
citadel, four of these firing on line with
keel and broadside; six 5.9-inch guns in
single casements of 5.5-inch armor;
fourteen twelve pounders, twelve one
pounders, four automatic rifles and two
torpedo tubes. The 7.5-lnch guns can
fire four rounds a minute. The water
line and : citadel armor is 8.27 Inches
thick, the belt extending from forward
to after turret. Within this citadel the
protective deck is 1.97 Inches and out-'
side of the citadel 2.76 inches In thick
ness. The total weight of armor is
2922 tons, or 28 per cent of the normal
displacement. Twin screw engines anC
Yarrow boilers of 14,000 horsepower are
calculated to give a speed of 19 knots.
Three ships of this class are under
construction, the third not yet
launched, and the estimated cost of
each is about $4,500,000.
A permanent submarine depot is to
be established at Portsmouth dock
yards, the headquarters of the flotilla,
but with the increase in numbers some
will be stationed at each naval port.
Six submarine boats of improved de
sign are to be built at once for the
French navy. They are to be of 422
tons displacement, 136 feet in length
and 12 feet diameter and propelled by
twin screws. The motive power is elec
tric and explosive motor, collectively
of 600 horsepower, calculated to give a
surface speed of 12 knots. Each boat
will be fitted with six torpedo tubes.
RECORD OF A COLLIER.
Plans for two battleships are being
prepared by Philip Watts, Director of
Naval Construction in Great Britain.
It is not believed that they will be as
large as the latest ships, but that a
displacement of 15,000 tons will be
found sufficient. Their main batteries
will consist of four twelve-inch guns,
placed in pairs in twelve-inch bar
bettes, and eight 9.2-inch guns. The
armor belt is to have a maximum
thickness of eight inches, the speed is
calculated at nineteen knots and the
full coal supply 2000 tons.
The battleships Triumph and Swift
sure, recently purchased from Chile
for the British navy, have had their
trials with satisfactory results. The
speeds attained were 20.17 and 20.5
knots respectively; the horsepower ex
ceeded 14,000 and the coal consump
tion was only 1.73; pounds per unit of
horsepower an. hour. In December
last, when the ships went through
their contractors' trials, the Libertad.
now named Triumph.- made six runs
over the measured mite at 20.17 knots
and. averaged 20.12 knots during a
continuous run of six hours. Prior to
these runs the vessel steamed twenty
seven hours at a speed of 17^4 knots,
consuming 1.71 pounds of coal per
horsepower an hour. It will be noted
that the results of the builders' trials
were duplicated during the Govern
ment speed trials, and even exceeded
in the Swiftsure, which was built at
Barrow, while the Triumph was built
at Elswick. Tha total coal capacity
of these ships ia 2000 tons, sufficient
to cross the . Atlantic at a speed of
nineteen knots â¢ and still . have a re
serve of coal. . At ten knots the radius
of. action is about 12,000 miles.

on Wednesday last, when Mrs. Thom

would naturally be expected of Mrs.'

gramme was exceptionally clever.
And a famous feature of ,the after
noon was some excellent punch â
home-made, to be sure, brewed by the
hospitable hostess of the day. â¢
The following programme was
given:
It is to be hoped that some of that
unprotested tax fund might be used
in carrying out the new law that cre
ated the Juvenile Court, and the com
pulsory education law with which it
is inseparable. May the club con
tinue in its good work.
vironment, the greater part of them
are saved tt/ good citizenship. And is
it not worth the effort?
Therefore a plea has gone out from
the California Club for more truant
officers, more probation officers. a
decent place to house the young of
fenders awaiting trial, a parental
home, where children of vicious sur
roundings may be placed â and then
let us wait for a few years for the
principal to bear interest. With such
men on the bench as Judge Murasky.
and such probation officers as Miss
Stebbins, with additional officers as
are now detailed for the work, the
interest will come back a thousand
fold. Fewer jails, fewer charities and
a lesser police protection would con
stitute the fund.
. Crystallization is the keynote in club
,dom as in society. Much discussion is
crowded into the few remaining club
cessions. th<? humorist notwithstanding,
and much good work is resultant. No ,
Oner phase of activity can be men
tioned than the campaign carried on
by the California Club and irther un-.
a'llied pood men and women, who have
labored earnestly in behalf of the de
pendent and delinquent children of the
city in rhe creation and maintenance
oÂ» the Juvenile Court,
Last Tuesday Mrs. Wallace P. An
gelo read a paper before the California
t_"lub on the larr.entab;e neglect of the
Fpirit of ihe new law, exposing in
terms all too tender Â«.he scandalous in
difference cf the municipal depart
rnents in the housing of the little
prisoners of the Juvenile Court pending
their iria! before Judge Murasky. And
more ihar. that, in providing but two
truant officers for 65.000 children, and
.only one probation officer. Miss Londa
Ftebbins, who performs tne duties with
hcrtiic effort, is paid by a per capita
tax of the women's clubs of the city,
and is de/ing the work that should be
ehai-eU by at least two assistants. And
to the shame of San Francisco be it
said, that while there are miilions for
police protection, there is not one dol
lar* for the saving of these children
fro-m depraved and dependent lives.
In Chicago, where there \v t re but four
limes the number of children brought
before the Juvenile Court last year
: that came before Judge Murasky. there
, are }.wcnty-four regular police officers
(plain clothes men) assigned to the
service of saving ih<: tykes of the to-wn,
besides forty probation officers. Now,
"mon and women of San Francisco,
:Â«hat have you to say for yourselves
, fcrr permitting every city in the State
and in the country to give a decent
"attention to their youthful delinquents,
' whfle you stand idly by and await
their development into criminals and

you will be called upon some day to

The Laurel' Hall, Club distinguished
itself once more for cleverness. On
Wednesday last Mrs. Ella Sexton's
play, "Twenty Century Lady Helps,"
was presented, and truisms it
satirized were all obvious to the la
dies. The play, is: an embodiment of
clever dialogue and is quite in keeping
with the reputation of the author.
The Pacific Coast Women's Press As
sociation will meet to-day in Century
Hall for the last meeting of the club
year. In the absence- of Mrs. Pinney,
Miss Ina Coolbrith will preside. The
scuvenir magazine will be presented to
the guests and members.
The Century Club has applied to the
Superior Court for permis'sion -to issue
$5000 worth of bonds, the funds to be
used in their proposed new/ clubhouse
on Sutter street, near Franklin.
Apropos of clubhouses, the plans for
the California clubhouse are complete
and can be seen at the clubrooms.
In acknowledgment of the musical
pleasures Madame Tojetti had given
the club during the year, she was pre

"Finally a doctor who is the most

"Well, that was two year* ago and I

. TOLL ROADSâ Two Readers. City.
In the early days of San Francisco
there were toll roads leading out of the
city. When Colonel Wilson bujlt the
Mission plank road in 1S51 there was a
toll house on Mission street near Sixth,
and one near Fourteenth. The first
was to catch the teams going out to
I the Mission Dolores, and the other
j those coming in, which could have
used the _plank read as far as that
point and "turned off to the northward
and by driving through the sand in the
valleys reach Sutter and Stockton
streets. When the Folsom street road
was built, 'also running to the Mlstlon
via Folsom to Sixteenth, and out that
street to the church, there were toll
houses. There were also toll houses on
the San Bruno turnpike and on the
Ocean View road.

Cal. The following Is given as an expla
nation why the sun appears red in a
fog: "When there is a mass of vapor
floating in the air, as in- a fog, the
orange and red rays of the light alone
are transmitted through it, and that
gives tl\p sun its red appearance when
viewed through the moisture-laden air.
All other tints are refracted and dis
persed, the atmosphere, when moist,
acting in the same manner a3 a prism.
Our Per Capita Tax.
A table has been prepared and issued
by the Department of Commerce and
Labor indicating that, despite the great
size of the appropriations, this country
is per capita more cheaply maintained
than any other in the world, with the
exception of China and India, and pos
sibly Russia. It costs, according to this,
Just $7 97 a year for each man, woman
and child in the United States to. run
the government, as against $9 80 for
Canada, $9 45 for the German empire,
?3 54 for Sweden, $10 09 for Spain, $11 45
for Portugal, $11 40 for the Netherlands,
$12 40 for Cuba. $12 68 for Argentina,
$14 27 for Austria-Hungary, $17 30 for
Paraguay, $17 40 for Belgium, $17 84 for
France, $21 39 for the United Kingdom,
537 69 for Australia and $38 38 for New
Zealand. Russia's per capita expendi
ture is approximately the same as that
of the United States.

But only saw frost-flowers through the

Come, coax the shyest blossoms of the

Bless us. sweet mother! Make the
palest smile,
And, with our storm-roughed cheeks
against thy breast.
Give us thy beauty for a little while.
No changelings call thee, for our hearts

THE ROSETTA STONEâ Subscriber.
City. The Rosetta stone was found by
M. Boussard, a French officer of engi
neers. In 1799, in an excavation made
near Fort St. Julien, Rosetta, Egypt.
It has an inscription in three different
languages, the hieroglyphic, the de
motic and the Greek. The Importance
and value of this stone lies in the fact
that it furnished the key for the deci
phering of the Egyptian hieroglyphics.

THE Los Angeles Times estimates that the value
of city property in Los Angeles has grown $20,
000,000 in the past twelve months. The figures
of the City Assessor reveal that the increase on assess
able property is $13,000,000. There were in progress on
March 1, the date when property values were reckoned,
improvements that are worth between $4,000,000 and $5,
000,000, but they were not taxed, being incomplete. The
advance in the total valuation is less than it was in the
preceding twelve months, when the figures showing the
gain were $23,000,000. The visible addition of $13,000,000
will give $180,000 more to the revenue of the city. The
Assessor finds that the slight horizontal rise in valua
tions throughout the business section is warranted by
the facts. This amounts to a gain of $2,000,000.
The bulk of the improved values is reported to be in
land subdivided and sold in city lots, together with the
improvements. In this direction the accretion of wealth
\s greater than in any previous year. Horizontal appre
ciations where there are no new improvements are few.
In 1903 there was a revaluation of nearly all the property
in the city. The; reassessment is practically confined
this year to the business district between First and Tenth
City Assessor Wismer makes a statement that shows
how sensitive realty is to improved conditions. "I have
been reliably informed," so he . tells the Los Angeles
Times, "that property near the site of the new postoffice
went from $50 a foot to $300 within twenty-four hours
after it was known where the postoffice would be lo
' cited." Â¦ Â¦Â¦'.â¢Â¦-:.
As usual the taxpayers are hoping that the larger as
sessment will bring *a lower tax rate, while, on the other
hand, the city departments are figuring what they can
do with the more bountiful supply of money in salaries
and improvements.

A BACK DATE â A. S., City. No
vember 6, 1850, fell on a Wednesday.
Considerable agitation has been displayed in the North
west over an uprising of the Columbia River Indians, who
have begun hostilities among themselves and threaten to
carry the fight into isolated white settlements. To an
ordinary observer the situation seems to afford no oppor
tunity for trepidation. It looks as if the time had c<Jme
for the making of a few more good red men.
Broad Churchmanship.
The Rev. V. B. Carroll, a Southern
clergyman, tells the following story:
"We were driving out one Sunday from
Decatur, when we came upon a negro
with a club in his hand and a freshly
killed 'possum on his shoulder. We
stopped to examine his prize, and the
colonel said:
" *My friend, do you know It is Sun
" 'Sartin, boss.*
" 'Are you a religious man?*
" I are. I'se Jlst on my way home>
from church.'
" 'And what sort of religion have you
got that permits you to go hunting on
Sunday?* -. â¢ _',.
" 'ReHgion? Religion?* queried the
man, as he held the 'possum up with
one hand and scratched his head with
the other. 'Does you 'spect any black
man in Alabama is gwlne to tie his
self up to any religion dat 'lows, a 'pos
sum to walk right 'cross the road ahead
of him an' git away free? No, sah! A
religion which won't bend a little when
a fat 'possum heads you off couldn't be
'stablished 'round yere by all the
preachers in the universe.' "
Friday, Thirteenth.
"Only four licensed to-day, boys,"
said Cupid .Danforth last Friday to the
newspaper men who came into his of
fice, as is their daily custom, to get the
names of those who had secured legal
permission to wed. "This is the quiet
est day I have had in the fifteen years
that I have had charge of the mar
riage license business."
"How do you account for it?" asked
the scribes.
"Just take a seat," smilingly an
swered Cupid. "It will be explained,
I am willing to wager, by the next
couple that comes in."
In less than five minutes a hand
some young girl, evidently an Ameri
can, accompanied by a good-looking,
well-dressed young fellow, entered the
office. The young man displayed none
of the bashfulness that is usually so
apparent in an applicant for a mar
riage license; neither 'did the young
lady. They were both business-like
when they approached the desk, and
they maintained that air during; the
entire time that it required to fill out
the necessary blank. They answered
Danforth's questions without any hesi
tation, and cordially thanked Cupid
when he handed the prospective
groom the paper that meant so much
to him and the young woman.
"You are not very superstitious,
I am glad to see," said Danforth, aa
he took the fee from the young man.
"How's that?" said the young fel
low. "What has superstition got to
do with a marriage license?"
"It really has nothing to do with it,"
smilingly answered Danforth, "only
there are a lot of people who would
not take out a license to get married
on Friday, the 13th." As he spoke he
pointed to a large calendar on the
wall. Sure enough, it read "Friday,
May 13."
The young man seemed to lose his
courage the moment his eyes lighted
upon the big black letters and figures.
As for the girl, she seemed Teady to
faint. For fully a minute they gazed
blankly at each other, and then the
girl managed to gasp out something
that sounded like "to-morrow." The
young fellow nodded affirmatively,
smiled a weak sort of smile, and
handed the license back to Danforth.
"It's too much for me, old man,"
he said. "I guess we'll drop in to
morrow."
Mormon Growth.
According to the Mormon authorities
upward of 2000 missionaries are con
stantly in the field, most of them young
men, and all under the supervision of
experienced leaders and directed from
headquarters established at central
points. Hardly a week passes that the
newspapers do not contain some item
concerning this invasion: Mormon eld
ers stoned in Ohio, a rich convert in
New Yo â¢. a new Irrigated valley
opened and settled In Wyoming, a
strong, new church organized in Illi
nois. Utah ia, of course, under Mor
mon political control, but it is not so
generally known that the Mormons
also control, or at least hold the bal
ance ot power. In Idaho, in Nevada

zona, Washington and other States,

not a' few United States Senators and
Representatives. Nor has the growth
of the church been confined wholly to
the United States. The Mormons ars

the newly opened Alberta country in
Canada, and they have taken up for
Irrigation considerable tracts of land
in- Mexico.â The Century.

Some interesting experiments have
Just been conducted at Bienne, France,
for testing the practical utility of cap
tive military balloons against infantry
or machine gun fire. The Paris corre
spondent of the Newcastle Chronicle
states that at a height of 800 yards a
few rifle volleys sufficed to shatter the
balloon, the range, it should be stated,
being known in advance. At an un
known altitude varring from 1100 to
2000 yards no fewer, than twenty-two
trial shots were needed to fix the range.
It was only the sixty-fourth volley that
hit the balloon, without, however, do
ing it any apparent damage. The ex*
periments are regarded as showing
that rifle flro Js not very effective, even
against captive balloons, at uncertain
ranges, and still less so against bal
loons that are not captive. J

DUBLIN. May 11.â If Davy Stephens
ever writes a book undoubtedly it will
be called "Royalties and Other Dis
'tinguished Folk Whom I Have Met."
In case cables have not reached Amer
ica of the rather considerable fuss
that has been made over Davy
Stephens since he passed his sixtieth
â¢ > irthday. it may bo explained that he
is the ol^ newspaper seller of Kings
town Pier. Ireland, whose list of ac
quaintances made in the way of busi
ness is so extraordinary a one. Crown
â¢ ed heads, titled aristocrats and illus
trious fommoiif-rs have joined in the
birthday congratulations that have
â¢ reached Stephens from all over the
*orld.
Davy has been selling newspapers
*>nd periodicals for fifty-four years, the
deyth of his father before he had
reached his sixth birthday having
compelled him to make an early start
in helping support the family. Pos
sessed of unfailing pood nature and a
ready Irish wit. he soon became popu
lar with his patrons, and. as increas
ing years developM his ptnver of
humor and genial qualities he won the
â¢ friendship of many distinguished men
nmong them. His customers, many of
v ho;n he can claim as more than ac
quaintances, have included the King,
the Emporor of Brazil, Queen Victoria,
the Prince of Wales, the Princess of
Wale?, Prince Bismarck, the Duke of
Connaught, the Duke of Clarence, the
Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and
Duchess of Teck, the Crown Prince of
Austria, the Shah of Persia. Napoleon
III. the Prince Imperial, Lord Bea
consneld. Lord Charles Beresford.
Lord Ormonde. Lord Castletown, Lord
' Duncar.non. Sir Henry Irving and a
host of other notables.
Among his most treasured souvenirs
1* a sovereign which was given him by
Queen Victoria on the occasion of her
last visit to Dublin in 1900. He first
met the late Queen, when, with the
Prince Consort, she landed at Kings
town over forty years ago, and in all
of her subsequent visits she invariably
patronized his stall and spoke some
kindly words to him. which were far
more highly prized than her liberal
payments. He first made the acquaint
ance of King Edward when he was a
very youthful Prince of Wales and has
met him bo often since and received
fo many gold coins from him that he
preserves only one as a souvenir of
their -acquaintance. The King loves a
pood joke and a good laugh and was
. invariably assured of both when, in
stepping ashore from the royal yacht,
he stopped at Davy's stall.
Of Prince Bismarck, who visited Ire
land twenty-five years ago, Davy does
not entertain particularly kindly recol
lections, for the "man of blood and
Iron" tossed him a handful of French
coppers in exchange for the newspapers
he bought, and passed grimly on his
way. Of a different sort was the un
fortunate Emperor of Brazil, who after
listening to some of Davy's funny
Btories offered him the post of court
Jester. Familiarity with statesmen en
ables him occasionally to venture on
Jokes at their expense, and he tells with
high Rlee how in the days of the Land
Leagne he frequently slipped extreme
Nationalist newspapers containing
â¢caricatures of Gladstone, Forster and
Balfour Into the hands of these gentle
men after they had crossed the Irish
Sea.
Sometimes Davy is called the "um
brella knight," and thereby hangs an
amusing story. He was selling news
papers one evening in the saloon of the
trail boat when she got under way
and was rounding the pier head when
he reached the deck. Not wishing to
CO to Holyhead Just then, he took a
header overboard, intending to swim
ashore. But some of the passengers
raised such a hubbub, fearing he would
l>e drowned, that a boat "was lowered
and he was unwillingly brought back
to the steamer. When he had been pro
vided with a dry outfit he set about
characteristically making the best of
the situation, and sang and danced in
the saloon for the amusement of the
dejighted company, which included the
then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The
latter declared he would reward Davy
â¢with knighthood, and Davy' obeyed
with alacrity the command to kneel.
Taking an umbrella from an adjacent
rack the Lord Lieutenant administered
a hearty whack with It across the
rtewsman's shoulders, exclaiming,
"Arise, Sir Davy!"
Stephen's news stall has long placed
him in comfortable financial circum
stances, and for the last twenty-one
3'ears he has crossed the channel regu
larly to see the Derby and exchange
greetings with some of his 'illustrious
customers. On this occasion he dis
cards his sou'wester and working out
fit for a silk hat, frock coat, white
Â¦waistcoat and patent leather boots. Sir
Henry Irving gave him a dinner on one
of these annual visits at which several
notables were present, and Lord Arthur
Hill introduced him to the Lord, Mayor
of London.
In a letter wishing him many happy
returns of his birthday Lord Charles
Beresford deplores the fact that they

Anno. Domini." But Davy still rises at
4 o'clock every rooming, winter and
summer alike, to meet the incoming

trappists in England.
When the French Government ex
pelled the little community of Trap
pist Brethren from the Abbey of Mel
leraie, near Nantes, where this rigorous
order first established itself in the
twelfth century, they involuntarily did
a good service to one of the prettiest
agricultural districts in Devonshire,
England.
It is marly two years since a band
of strange-looking, silent men, clad in
waist-girdled rabes of somber hue and
forbidding cowls, came gliding through
the quaint little market town of Kings
bridge. *
The inhabitants gazed with astonish
ment, possibly not unleavened by a
stnse of awe. The newcomers were
Roman Catholic toonks; this much they
understood. But whence did they come,
and what did they want?
Then gradually their story was
pieced together, and it became known
to the wondering yeomen and gossiping
lassies that this band of Cistercians
had come from France to settle down
in the traditional land of freedom;
that they had acquired the big estate
at Wood Barton, Lcrddiswell, with its
six hundred acres of fat soil, and that
they meant to live In this pastoral
retreat.
The Order of La Trappe is one Of the
most rigorous in the Papal faith. Its
members literally consign themselves
to a living death s</ far as communica
tion either with the outer world or
with themselves is concerned. The sol
itary exception, when they break the
mournful silenca is at the morning
Sieeting, "Memento mori!"â"Remem
ber death!"
They sleep in their own coffins upon
straw. These coffins are placed slant
wire. A Trappist monk never knows
the bliss of slumbering supine, unless
he be ill.
In the gray of the dawn they steal
forth like shadows, for manual labor
forms one of the great ethics of their
creed. A long spell of inarticulate
prayer heralds in the mute tasks of
each day. A frugal breakfast is fol
lowed by one of the sternest of the
daily obligationsâ each man digs one
shovelful of earth from out of his fu
ture grave.
And when the Trappist monk
breathes his last he is laid to rest in
the same robes in which he passed his
everyday life. Their habit consists of
a dull white robe or casscrck, a black
scapulary (the cowl can be pulled up
over the head), and a woolen girdle.
Yet, watching the members of this
devoted band at their toll it is impos
sible not to believe that they are -hap
py in their intense self-denial. An in
describable air of peaceful serenity
seems to rest upon the features of one
and all. They believe that the most
austere abnegation is the surest road
to eternity, and they live up to their
simple ideal earnestly, perseveringlyâ
but always silently.
Most usefully do they fill their place
on earth, however, despite the almost
incredible self-containment of their
lives. They not only support . them
selves by the honest sweat of their
brow, but they give abundant alms to
the poor who present themselves at the
monastery gates. Surely an order to
admire and respect by men of all creeds
are these monks of La Trappe.
The transformation they have effect
ed in their Loddiswell estate is a
source of marvel even to the sturdy
Kingsbridge husbandmen themselves.
When they took over that demesne It
was wild and neglected in the extreme.
The restoration of and additions to
the buildings will not be quite com
pleted until about July next. Mean
while the gloomy old manor now looks
like a typical monastery.
But it is mainly in the lands sur
rounding th^ir abode that these ever
silent, somber-looking men have
wrought such striking changes. No
model farm can compare with the per
fect order and high state of cultiva
tion which marks every rood of those
six hundred acres; and they have re
claimed tracts which throughout liv
ing memory have been waste and bar
ren.âLondon Daily Express.
AN effort is being made by some of the commercial
organizations of the West to take advantage of the
meeting this year in St. Louis of three hundred
or more conventions and induce them, if possible, to con
vene next year in some city in the West. The matter
was favorably discussed at the Trans-Mississippi Com
mercial Congress held last year in Seattle and later was
taken up by the Denver Chamber of Commerce. The
plan to unite for the -purpose has been already indorsed
by the active officers of the commercial bodies stated,
the National Irrigation Association and the heads of the
passenger departments of several Western rjfitroads.
An idea of the importance of the matter may be gained
by noting the following list of some of the meetings
that will be held this year at St. Louis: Good Roads
Congress, International Congress of Electricity, Inter
national Congress of Lawyers and Jurists, congresses on
engineering,' temperance, Sunday rest, instruction of the
deaf and an international library congress, National
Federation of. Musical Clubs, Federation of Day Nurs
eries, National Co-operative Congress, National Eclectic
Medical Association, Sons of the American Revolution,
Railway Clerks of America, Music Teachers' National
Association, American Neurological Association,. Ameri
can Congress on Tuberculosis, National Educational As
sociation, American Library Association, American
League of Civic Improvement jointly with the American
Park and Outdoor Art Association and the League of
American Municipalities. "
It is intended at all times during the existence of the
St. Louis Exposition to have a delegation of active West
ern representatives attend, every convention and advocate
the interests of some city previously decided upon and
to have all Pacific Coast and Western -cities interested
join in backing such action. It has been suggested that
to promote unity an advance conference of those cities
be held in San Francisco, and the details of a working
plan adopted.
Portland, Oregon, is particularly interested in the
movement in view of the Lewis and Clark Centennial
Exposition to be held there next year, and the Portland
Commercial Club has already engaged a manager to
work for the proposition.
The movement is a good one and the exceptional
chance offered at St. Louis for concentrated effort
should stimulate to action those cities that will profit by
it. The United States is pre-eminently a convention
country. There is a growing recognition here of the ad
vantage to be derived from a general discussion by rep
resentative people of trade, finance, social, religious and
fraternal matters. The city that can gain a reputation
as a successful "convention city" is fortunate. It has
the opportunity of entertaining those people who, as a
rule, are prominent in their respective communities at
a time when they are enjoying themselves by combining
pleasure with business and are therefore in a favorable
mood to be impressed.
For our Western cities there is more than a temporary
financial benefit to be obtained by entertaining such peo
ple. In their travels they cover pretty thoroughly al!
points of interest and thus see and become familiar with
our great undeveloped resources, gaining a knowledge
of them which could not otherwise be obtained. The
dissemination of such knowledge to the greatest number
should be our aim, and the plan to use the fair to that
end should be heartily encouraged.
CONVENTIONS INi THE WEST.
Conclusive.
A certain city official, whom for ob
vious reasons we will designate as Mr.
Blank, is an ardent admirer of prize-
IKshting. while his better half is vio
lently opposed to it and has no liking
for those who attend pugilistic events.^
In order to keep peace in the family
Blank tells his wife that he never
attends Boxing .contests, and with that
declaration Mrs. Blank, is satisfied,
having the most implicit confidence in
the veracity of her liege lord.
Blank is, however, put to the
trouble of sometimes making explana
tions, for, being a popular official, he
is always mentioned in the newspaper
accounts as "among those present" at
the ringside. He generally manages to
appease his wife's wrath by telling
her it is a mistake, that he was not
at the pugilistic battle and that she
must not believe everything she reads
in the, newspapers.
Now It happened that there was to
be a championship contest one evening
and Blank was especially desirous of
going, but his wife insisted that he
accompany her to the theater. Blank
did so, and was miserable all evening.
The next* morning he picked up the
newspaper to read the account of the
fight' and there, staring him in the
face, was a caricature of himself as
large as life with the caption: "Blank
was on hand as usual."
With a smile he handed the paper
to his wife.
"Now, my dear," said he. "you can
see for yourself how unreliable these
accounts are. We were at the theater
together last night, were we not?"
"We certainly were, John," said
Mrs. Blank, as she glanced at the
caricature. "I never again will be
lieve whai the newspapers say." And j
Blank, being wise in his generation,
laughed Inwardly. â¢
is very fond of relating how on one
occasion his Lordship seized his papers
and ran down the platform selling
them. Davy admits that he never
found a better deputy, and thinks that
if Lord Beresford had stuck to selling
newspapers he would have proved a
very formidable rival.
TRADE conditions continue as reported for several
weeks past. The slow but steady downward ten
dency in prices is still perceptible, and the usual
commercial figures, on which the state of business is
largely based, still run rather against the mercantile sit
uation all over the country.
Â¦ The bank clearings last week showed a loss from last
year, of 8.7. per cent, with all but two or three of the
largest cities on the wrong side of the exhibit. Even St.
Louis, which ought to be stimulated by the exposition,
which is bringing a large amount of cash into the city,
showed the insignificant gain of only 1.2 per cent, which,
in view of the exceptional conditions existing there,
really amounts to a loss compared with 1903. The loss
at Pittsburg, the seat of the iron and steel industry, was
27.4 per cent; at Philadelphia, distinguished by its textile
industries, 14.2 per cent; at Chicago, tl.e center of the
grain and provision industries, 1 1.2 per cent, and at New
York, the center of everything American in the aggre
gate, 9.7 per cent. There was a sharp loss of 25.8 per
cent at Cleveland, which may be partially attributed to
the serious strike of masters and pilots of lake vessels,
which is greatly hindering transportation in the lake
region and is said to be the most damaging labor disturb- 1
ance of the year. Minneapolis, the seat of the flour trade,
lost 7.6 per cent. Even New Orleans, which for several
months has been showing large gains over 1903 owing
to the cotton boom, has at last turned and is now found
in the loss column, with a decrease of 11.5 per cent. San
Francisco about held its own.
The above figures give a very fair idea of how general
business is running throughout the country. The fail
ures for the week numbered 236, against 191 last year,
and the railway earnings thus far in May show a falling
off of 6.6 per cent from the same week in 1903.
The dullness and continued decline in the New York
stock market are ascribed to the above conditions, with
the added adversities of a depressed iron and steel mar
ket, which has-been sending in poor returns for^ some
weeks, remarkably heavy gold exports and the natural
dullness characteristic of a Presidential year. All at
tempts to organize a "bull campaign" in stocks have ap
parently been abandoned, in spite of the recognized
cheapness of many of the standard stocks. It is the be
lief that the time for any extensive bull movement has
gone by, if indeed there lias been any such time this year,
which is extremely doubtful.
However, a bank statement better than expected on
Saturday imparted a very bullish aspect to -the market,
which responded by advancing a point or so. This might
have been a flash in the pan, but it was sufficient to drive
some of the bears to cover and cause more or les's pre
dictions of a better market from now on. The summer
vacation peiiod, which is much longer and more pro
nounced than it used to be,' is not far off, and the Presi
dential election will follow closely in its wake. This
brings us up to about the Christmas holidays, wh'en the
wholesale trade of the country comes to a standstill for
the usualstock-taking. Hence no marked revival in gen
eral business is expected until after, the, turn of the year,
seven month's at least from now. ',
It is perhaps as well. It is a question whether a good
lull and some further recession in prices will not be the
very best thing that could happen to the country. The
great financial interests seem to think so, for they are
agreed that the recent wave of unprecedented prosperity
had begun to make the American people a nation of reck
less spendthrifts, fond of luxury and accustomed to an
unlimited fatness of everything. A little economy from
now on will not hurt us in the least. A few yards of
sackcloth in place of the rustling silks may do us good.
Our brains and stomachs will get a rest and we will get
a chance to chew our cud awhile and think the matter
over. The bankers say that the current recession is "re
storing business to a more normal basis," to repeat their
very words, and if they, with their enormous interests,
are content with the drift of affairs, why should not the
*rest of us be?
As far as the great staples are concerned there have
been no violent fluctuations during the week. Money,
which showed signs of getting harder a week ago, has
turned easier again and continues in ample supply for
all current' needs. The turning over of $9,000,000 in coin
to J. P. Morgan & Co. by the Government in partial
payment of the Panama account considerably offset the
drain upon the cash reserves of the banks due to the
withdrawals of gold for export to Europe and imparted
a different aspect to the financial situation. The move
ment of cash from the interior to New York, which has
been heavy of late, has also proved an important factor in
checking the incipient hardening in funds. For the
moment at least the equilibrium has been largely re
established and the money market is again on an even
keel, with the great body of metropolitan capitalists
resting on their oars, neither adding to their holdings
nor liquidating, neither selling nor buying on any unusual
scale. . Y-r
All commercial reports agree that stocks of almost all
staples are considerably, larger than they were some
months ago and that they are steadily increasing. Promi
nent in this respect are iron and steel, provisions, live-,
stock of all kinds and textile goods. Some are showing
an accumulation which is weakening prices. The flour
and textile mills are frequently closing down for a few
days to allow the consumption to overtake the produc
tion. But the most pronounced inactivity is reported by
the iron and steel trades.
The weather is still rather against business. There
have been several periods \>Â£ fine weather over the great
cereal belts of late, but as a rule they have been brief.
The average has shown too much dampness of air and
soil and too low temperatures for crop growth or
distributive trade. In consequence the usual spring busi
ness has been a disappointment arid has brought the
country up to a summer which promises to be quiet.
The Pacific Coast continues to send in the best com
mercial^reports. Our newly developed Oriental com
merce is'helping the three. States out wonderfully. We
are selling a large quantity of farm produce to the
American, Russian and Japanese Governments for their
armies and navies in the Orient. Our supplies have been
so reduced that we are going into the new crop year
with our warehouses practically bare of everything, and
is our crop prospects are excellent we are justified in
looking forward to another good year. Hence there is
an air of. confidence and cheerfulness throughout the
whole coast and no complaints of any consequence are
heard from any quarter. . . " ' '.-"Â¦..

This Is a clean town for a refined and whole
some family life. In a non-commercial atmos
phere. In the classic (hades of a twentieth
century university. This is our message.
This modest description of Palo Alto
is signed In behalf of the Palo Alto
Board of Trade by the board's secre
tary, C. C. Downing.
On the whole we can say to all modest home
seekers â hÂ«re Is the place you have been seek
ing. If. after you have educated your children,
you think best to sell and go away, you will
find your investment here has incrjaÂ«d in
value; but more and more of our people con
tinue here after the children are gone. About
onp-third of the students live in town and
find board and rooms in the homes. Im
proved facilities for reaching the university
will increase thlÂ» number. The gate of the
university is but three minutes' walk f.-om the
center of business, but the grounds are large
and the distance to the university is one mile.
Carriages and wheels make the trip easy and
In the near future an electric car service *'iU

considerable.
In January 1890, there were ten Inhabitants;
in January. 1901, a little less,than 2000; in Janu
ary. lÂ«01, closely approaching 4000. The as
sessed value of the town is. $1,750,000. The ed
ucational facilities are the best, from primary
Bchools to graduate departments in the univer
sity. The grammar and high schols are the
pride of the city, and there is a general agree
ment to epare no expense upon them to make
the placa Absolutely unique as a center of edu
cation for the youth of all ages.
The town Itself has no palatial grounds.
Citizens who desire such places can find them
within three mikrs In great variety. It Is the
ideal place for modest homes of from $1500 to
$10,000 each. The lots are 50 feet by 100 to 200
feet deep. Of 125 houses built last year ths
average cost was $3300. This fixes the modest
character of our town. The tendency to vulgar
display is absent, and by many this will be es
teemed most highly.
As a place of business Pala Alto, like i other
cities about the bay, has no large future.
While it Is likely to have a population of 15,000
Inhabitants, It Is certain that a larpe fraction
of Its citizens,wlll do business In San Francisco.
The time Is being gradually reduced, and the
freedom from delay by fegs and the safety of
the trip from Palo Alto to San Francisco will
givr. it a distinct advantage over its education
al rival, the city of Berkeley.
Other advantages are its homogenous pop
ulation and Its rapid growth and civic enter
prlw. Palo Alto Is already the second city In
Santa C'ara County; has excellent sewer, water
â¢nd electric systems owned by the t:wn; is
Junt completing a library building, the gift
of Mr. Carnegie: has opened a public gymnasi
um and baths, Which are well managed under
the auspices of the wide awake Woman's
Clul. Pa.lo Alto.
ADVANTAGES SUMMED UP.
The growth of Palo Alto is pictured
by the Palo Alto Bbard of Trade in
substance as follows:
The moral atmosphere of the place iÂ« felt at
once. There are no saloons, and landlords are
strenuou? on this point with all tenants lest
tha property revert to the original owner. The
churches arÂ« numerous and well supported.
Palo Alto is the most conspicuous example of
Central California that it pays a town to be
clean. There are clean streets, clean city
government, clo.-in business and clean people.
Kor these reasons the town grows.
The rural beauty of the place Is marked, and
few places are (superior In this. Our climate
Is mild at all seasons, and peculiarly free from
extremes and disagreeable winds. It Is not as
well adapted to lunÂ£ and bronchial troubles as
are the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley In
Southern California; otherwise there is noth
ing to be defllred that Is not supplied In physU
cal conditions.
The Palo Alto Board of Trade has is
sued some literature to describe and
advertise. A pamphlet has Just been
put to press entitled "Palo Alto, the
Town of the Leland Stanford Junior
University." Therein are given some
reasons for the growth of the town and
some facts relative to its progress. Ex
tracts are given as the official utter
ances of the body whose duty it is to
promote* the interests of Palo Alto:-
In 1894 Palo Alto was incorporated.
Since 1897 municipal progress has been
rapid. J. J. Morris says that the first
important step was the acquirement of
a municipal water system, from which
ample water is derived for the uses of
the town. A * sewer system followed,
and then a municipal lighting plant.
Then followed a time of street im
provements, that still continues. Miles
of cement sidewalk have been laid. The
bases for sure and continued growth
were securely laid.
Schools have been provided, with
good instructors. Churches of many
denominations have been founded, with
handsome structures in central loca
tions. The buildings are used to show
the general architectural characteris
tics of Palo Alto as they are. developed
in buildings for public uses. More than
$100,000 r>er annum has been expended
for new buildings.
Since the settlement of the Govern
ment suit against the Stanford estate
the progress of the university construc
tion work has been steady, arid Palo
Alto has shared largely in the benefits.
The town has other attractions, not the
least of which is an excellent climate;
but the seal of the university is on all
of Its life, as the Impression of the
University of California is upon all
Berkeley, as a leading Influence. ;
present size and finished aspect are the
more remarkable.
PUBLIC UTILITIES.
tages with modern improvements as to
make of Palo Alto one of the prettiest
places in the United States.
In general characteristics Palo Alto
would seem to the casual visitor to be
strikingly similar to Berkeley. The seat
of the University of California has al
ways boasted that there was a mile
limit about the university grounds in
all directions within which intoxicating
liquors could not be sold. This has
preserved the same character for all
the immediate neighborhood of the
great institution of learning at Stan
ford.
In the deeds to lands that were cut
up for the original lots in Palo Alto
was a provision that no intoxicants
were to be sold thereon. There is not
a barroom in Palo Alto, either in res
taurant or hotel. In both Berkeley and
Palo Alto there has been rapid and
steady growth of homes, and the home
| spirit In both the university towns is
marked.
One of the leading members of the
Palo Alto Board of Trade related with
pride to a writer for The Call that the
original sales of lots for the town site
date back only to 1891â less than four
teen years ago. After that date came
the suit against the Leland Stanford
estate brought by the United States
Government to recover 515,000,000 for
money loaned during the construction
of the country's first transcontinental
railway. This suit was filed in 1S93.
Some progress had been made toward
building up the town of Palo Alto in
1891-92, but the suit, rendering uncer
tain for a period of four years the ex
istence of the Stanford University and
the concurrent value of the land in
Palo Alto, put a stop to progress very
largely. When the settlement of the
issue with the Government was reached
In 1837 confidence returned. Practically
Palo Alto as now visible has been about
all built since early in 1897. Hence its
towns and cities. Refinement and love
of trees are to be found together. By
keeping the oaks and by placing among
them artistically designed homes and
by cultivating flowering shrubbery and
plants assiduouely, the people of Palo
Alto have so coupled natural advan-
. The college people and those who
have come to dwell in their neighbor
hood have wisely refrained from cut
ting down the oak trees. In fact, such
trees are to be found in places In the
sidewalk areas, throwing their grate
ful shadows for the benefit of passers
hf. the fashion of tfe great elm trees
that may still, after the lap^e of a
%-entury. be found in the middle of
sidewalks in certain New England
. At first the population of the new
town was almost exclusively engaged
in providing for the wants of the stu
dents and faculty of the Stanford Uni
versity and those who came to Palo
Alto in connection with the university
work. Rapidly, on the site of what
was, acreage property only a few years
a^o, a community claiming to have
4000 population apart from the univer
sity has grown up. The scholastic at
mosphere common to all university
towns has accompanied the develop
ment. The site of Palo Alto was very
beautiful before it was ever considered
as the home of a large collection of
people. On its level area there was a
vigorous growth of oak trees that dot
led the landscape picturesquely. The
two -divisions of the Coast Range
'Mountains loomed up handsomely in
the foreground. Its lar^e percentage
of bright and pleasant days every year
made it desirable as a place of homes.

Exciting Game of Lacrosse Is Played
for Benefit Before Larjfe Crowd i
at Presidio Grounds.
The San Francisco Lacrosse team de
feated the San Mateo team at the Pre
sidio athletic grounds yesterday after
noon by the score 10 to 4.
Up to the forth quarter of the game
the visitors from San Mateo had scored
but one point, though their playing was
but little inferior to that of the home
team. In the fourth quarter, however,
their luck seemed to change and they
scored three goals in rapid succession.
E. Peterson, defense for the San
Francisco team, played a fine cool
game, but was injured in the third
quarter and was obliged to retire from
the field. .
Renwlck,' Scanlan and Darragh did"
most of the star playing of the match.
Scanlan scored fl\e times, Darragh
twice and Renwick twice.
The game was played for the benefit
of the Park Amphitheater fund and
financially should prove a success as
the attendance waa large.

SUMMARY.
Wheeler got into the box in the
seventh, when Hall was beginning to
get his a little stronger. Wheeler had
nothing which could stop the commut
ers. In fact, they liked him better than
his fellow slabman and therefore the
runs came In just the same. Frahcks
did some great fielding and his throws
to first bape made the bleacherites howl
with delight many times. Schlafly
made the circus catch of the occasion
in the fourth Inning, when he went up
in the air and gloved Bernard's drive
with one mitt. The score:

After that inning it was nothing
but runs for Oakland. Every man on
the team with the exception of "Bush"
Streib had a hit In his club and every
man was willing and. ready to unbottle
thfr bingle at the right time. Los An
geles was mystified by the way Gra-*
ham unwound his left. The southpaw
pot wild and erratic every once in a
while, but when men were on bases he
was there and pretty strorig. The An
gels really never had a chance to make
runs.
That was all till the fifth. Then
Ganley beat out a bunt and gave a
clever exhibition cf footwork by going
away around to third on Franck's
sacrifice.. Schlafly sent him In with a
drive to right and Devereaux again
managed to collide with a slow shoot.
Schlafly arrived on Streib's nice one to
center. When Graham responded with
one of his slashing two-base clouts to
the left garden it brought Devereaux
over the jumps.
Oakland got a start in the second in
ning of the conflict at the Eighth
street lot. Schlafly walked and Dev
ereaux collided with a shoot in the
ribs. Graham was purposely walked
by Hall, filling 'em all up. Byrnes also
partook of Hall's generosity, forcing
Schlafly In. "Bush" Streib soused one
to Toman. Jimmy winged the ball to
Flood, who dropped It, letting the red
one come home. Ganley brought in the
third tally with a bingle over Wheeler's
h^ad. v
In both games the Oakland pitchers
had concealed on their persons an as
sortment as varied as it was bewilder
ing. Schmidt acted as he was wont to
do In Brooklyn . while the morning
struggle was waged. Graham was the
big chief in the afternoon and on both
occasions the fielders handled prac
tically everything that happened to roll
on the diamond.
It was all the result of the wallop â
the solid wallop that never fails to
bring runs over the plate. Three pit ti
ers were made to sufferâ the wondrous
and ponderous Doc Newton, "Rusty"
Hall and "Flop" Wheeler. It was a
day of beatings â one of the best of the
year. ' .
Los Angeles is a champion baseball
team ; also a fall team. As a reward
for eighteen rounds of toil yesterday
the best the Angels got was a bunch of
round boys. In the meantime Peter
was spurring his iads on to make a
few runs. They did make a fewâtwen
ty in all â establishing a record for this
season on the Pacific Coast. Scores:
Morning gameâ Oakland 8, Los Angeles
0. Afternoon gameâ Oakland 12, Los

George Nethercott's Barge, pro
nounced the finest looking greyhound
in all America, surprised the followers
of coursing at Union Park yesterday
by defeating his kennel mate Pocatelli
in three straight courses.
The up-country greyhounds were the
survivors of the best available eight
hounds which have been competing for
some weeks in the Grand Nation"*.!
Champion stakes. The trials were
short yesterday, the longest being for
ty-nine seconds and the others eleven
and fifteen, respectively. Barge Jed by
a slight margin each time, Pocatelli
failing to show the electrifying .burst
of speed for which he was famous a
year ago.
Eugene Geary's champion Palo Alto,
the hero of many sensational trials,
won the open stake from a "classy"
field. He met Richard Anton in the
deciding course and won by the close
score of 6 to 5. He had considerable
good fortune during the day, being led
to the hare bv. J. Dennis' The Referee
in the second round. He also had a
close race with McVev in the semi
final round, the score in Palo Alto's
favor benig 3 to 2. The day's results-,

to which total Stahl (31), Foster (IS),
Baugh (14) and Harold Ward (13)
were the chief contributors. Dr. Tay
lor took six wickets for twenty- nine
runs and H. Bowly captured three
for the same number of runs. Against
this moderate total the Pacific team
were able to make only seventy-eight
run3, the chief contributors being
Bowly (29 not out) and Petherick
(16). The full details follow:
The first set of the final match was
the longest of the day and was the
only one Gabriel won in the match. In
the second set Gabriel faced a lead of
4-0 and pulled up to 4-4. but a mistake
by the server in calling the score 4-2
instead of 4-3 probably cost Gabriel the
set. Adams played a clever game in
ail of his matches and his victory was
a popular one. Drolla, the cup holder.
was badly beaten by Gabriel in the â¢
first round.
In the fourth class Dr. LoveRrove
was the surprise c-f the day. By win
ning two matches and both in straight
sets the Doctor obtained a place in the
semi-finals. His peculiar service,
which he has been practicing dally, -
was a puzzle to his opponents and un
doubtedly was the means of his win
ning. Lovegrove had a close call in his :
match with Josephs, but won two sets
both of which were long and close.
As was expected Guerln. the winner
of the last tournament, had little dif
ficulty in reaching the finals.

Outside of the final3 by far ths best
match in the third class was that be
tween Jules F. Brady and Fred Adams
in the first round. Adams won both
sets but they were extremely long and
close. Brady played a clever game and
made the class winner play his beat to
beat him.
The third and fourth class players of
the Golden Gate Tennis Club struggled

proceedings was the forty-fifth anni
versary outing of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein.
On Wednesday the San Francisco
Schutzen Verein will hold its most im
portant event of the year, when the
members will take part in the eagle
shoot. The scores:
The Golden Gate Rifie and Pistol Club
held its monthly competitive meeting
and the Norddeutscher Schuetzen Com
pany held a practice shoot.
The target ranges at Shell Mound
Park were not busjly engaged yester
day, for the reason that the San Fran
cisco Schuetzen Verein held its^innual
family outing and devoted most of the
day to providing entertainment for its
guests.
The Red Men's shooting company
held a prize contest for members, to
gether with a medal and" bullseye
shoot.
Mr.- Macdonough's' offer, finally pre
vailed, and the horse was said to have
cost him $150,000 landed at Menlo Park.
Ormonde reached this country by a cir
cuitous route. It was necessary in or
der to get him suitable accommoda
tions to send him first to England,
thence to New York and thence to this
city. He traveled in the most luxu
riously furnished apartments, and at
every stopping place crowds turned out
to pay homage to the famous horse.
It was t>artly on this account that
the Duke of Westminster sold him to
Senor Jose Bocav of Buenos Ayres,
for $70,000, and all England mourned
for their favorite, which was sent to
the Argentine Republic. The strug
gles of Ormonde, Minting and Bendi
go had provided some of the greatest
sensations in English turf 'history. A
syndicate of English' sportsmen made
a bid of $100,000 for Ormonde and-
Charles Reed, the famous Tennessee
turfman, raised this to $135,000.
Ormonde, the horse of the century,
owned by "William O'Brien Macdon
ough, died on Saturday at the lat
ter's establishment at Menlo Park.
The great horse, which was the idol
of the British public for years, seemed
in robust health up to a. recent date,
when signs of paralysis appeared. This
finally carried him off.
When Mrs. Langtry was In thl3
State some months since she made a
pilgrimage to the home of the turf
celebrity. At that time Ormonde was
as spry as a four-year-old^
Alter leaving England Ormonde was
a , disappointment in the stud. He
leaves out few sons and daughters in
this country to perpetuate his mem
ory. Beau Ormonde, owned in this
State and now racing in Chicago, is
one of the best of his sons. ]yir. Mac
donough leased the breeding qualities
of Ormonde for a time to James Ben
Ail Haggin, master of Rancho del
Paso, Sacramento, but this turfman's
clever grooms were no more success
ful with Ormonde than were his other
attendants -and no foals were secured.
Ormonde's early days in the stud
were crowned with success. Among
others he begot the sensational Orme
which sired Flying Fc-x. The latter
was Bold to the Russian Government
at a record price.
Ormonde was a bay horse and stood
16:1 hands in height. The late Fred
Archer rode him in his principal races.
Ormonde was bred by the Duke of
Westminster and was foaled in 1883.
making him 21 years old. He was by
Ben d'Or, out of Lily Agnes, she' by
Marcaroni. He won the "triple crown"
in his three-year-old form, these races
including the Thousand Guineas, the
Derby and the St. Leger. His total
windings on the turf were $145,000. W.
O.B. Macdonough opened negotiations
for the great horse in November. 1892.
but did not finally secure him until
September of the following year. Or
monde reaching this city on September
4, 1893. Ormonde became touched in
the wind in England and it was
thought removal to a warmer clime
would alleviate this trouble.

The meeting at Petaluma has been
such a pronounced success that Harry
Stover has made application to the Pa

his racing dates. With the service of

locking to Kenilwonh Park. Manager
Stover thinks he could play to another
week with good pecuniary results.
Five bookmakers laid odds last Sat

of the betting. George Ro.se quitting
the biggest winner. The odds have been
fully as good as were offered at Oak

ably true to form.

that thoroughbreds are consistent if

saloon of P. J. Dunne at the corner
of Eddy and Market streets about 7
o'clock yesterday morning and began
using abusive language to William
Winthrop Jr., the bartender. Wilson
pulled a revolver out of his pocket,
pointed it at Winthrop and threatened
to kill him. Winthrop ran down the
stairs leading to the basement, escaped
Into Eddy street and told Policemen
Carr and Hutchings what had oc
cured. They went to the saloon and
arrested Wilson, who was taken to the
City' Prison and was charged with
threats against life and carrying a con
cealed weapon. When searched a pair
of steel knuckles was found In his
pockets. He must answer for carry-
Ing them. He threatened to have the
whole police force dismissed and be
came so obstreperous that he had to
be put in the dark cell. He was evi
dently bordering on mania.

DRUG CLERK THREATENS
TO SHOOT BARTENDER
Four men held up and brutally beat
Chris Orffsan and William O'Connor
last night on Beale street, near How
ard. The thugs secured a watch from
Orffsan.
O'Connor and Orffsan were walking
along Beale street. When they reached
a dark spot near Howard street they
were set upon by four men, who were
ar/ned with clubs, and frightfully
beaten. Orffsan's nose " was almost
severed and had to be sewed on at
Harbor Hospital. The cries of the two
men brought Special Officer Beatty to
scene, but the thugs made good their
escape.
Orffsan resides at 240 East street
and O'Connor lives at the City Hotel

An Excellent Opportunity
The question as to how L'Humanile
of Paris became possessed of the note
of protest addressed to the other
powers, which varied from that sent
to the French Government, is daily be
coming more interesting.
ROME, May 22. â Vatican authorities
continue' to be agitated over the con
flict with the French Government
growing out of the protest against
President's Loubefs visit to Rome and
the recall of M. Nizard. the French
Embassador to the -Vatican.
The Pope said mass this morning: In
the presence of sixty-four Italians and
foreigners, and gave up the rest of
the day to the consideration of the dif
ficulties with France, reading clippings
from the newspapers on the subject.
The Vatican hopes that M. Nizard
will soon return to Rome, being Influ
enced by the fact that his family is
still here.
. "Up to the present the Nuncio has
received no orders to take his leave,
although the state of his health might
make it desirable. As Rome has no
taste for replying to provocations,, but
Is conscious of her rights and duties,
Monslgnor Lorenzelli does not regard
the eventuality of his leave as proxi
mate."
The tone of the socialist papers in
dicates that that powerful element has
urged the Government to take more
extreme measures.
ThÂ» more moderate elements appear
to be satisfied with the course of the
Government,, while the reactionary
clerical papers express regret.
Little is heard directly of the senti
ments of the clergy, who are practically
muzzled by their official positions under
the concordat.
The Embassador is expected to arrive
here to-morrow morning, when he will
confer with Foreign Minister Delcasae
and go over the details of the rup
ture between France and the Vatican,
preliminary to the meeting of the
Council of Ministers on Tuesday, when
a further line of action will be deter
mined upon.
Contrary to general expectation Mon
signor Lorenzelli, the Papal Nuncio at
Paris, will not leave his post. The
Nunciature has given out the follow
ing statement:
PARIS. May 23.â The Ministry of the
Interior authorizes a denial of the
statement that M. de Navenne, first
secretary of the French embassy to the
Vatican, will act as Charge d'Affalres
at the embassy, stating: that the Gov
ernment considers that his selection
would attenuate the Importance of the
action taken in the recall of Embassa
dor Nizard.

Mrs. Victoria' Alice Murphy Stan
leigh, who attempted suicide by in
haling illuminating gas from a tube
at 706 Vallejo street last Thursday,
died at the Central Emergency Hos-.
pital yesterday morning. Illness and
despondency prompted the deed. Mrs.
Stanleigh claimed she was the daugh
ter of Captain Francis J. Murphy of
the Royal Fusiliers and spoke during
her lifetime of a fortune that was due
her from Australia. She came to this
city from Los Angeles, last December,
and since lived on charity. She claims
that her husband, Stanleigh, was a
physician and died in Montreal about
eight years ago. Her strange reti
cence regarding names and events in
her past caused the Associated Char
ities to abandon interest in her.

"The Silver Moon" is one of the
brightest comedy sketches produced at
the Orpheum in many moons. It intro
duces four people â Charles H. Burke,
Grace La Rue and two colored lads â
and it is their individual and collective
work that makes the piece so radiant.
Mr. Burke is a laughmaker despite
himself, Miss La Rue is both pretty
and clever and the Afro-American ju
veniles act .as well as sing and "rag."
The first-nighters would not let the
quartet depart ."until . the Caucasian
adult delivered a neat speech of appre
ciation. "
The Colby family repeat the big hit
they made on the same stage last sea
son, "their pew songs and instrumental
selections being every whit as enter
taining as their discarded stuff. Al
Lawrence is a young man of rare vocal
versatility, whose songs, stories, imita
tions and ventriloquisms consume twen
ty minutes of unflagging interest. Al
fons, a trapeze equilibrist, enlivens a
threadbare act with new and daring
features. Belle Gordon punches a bag
in divers ways and with unfemlnine
vigor. The motion pictures are scenes
from the career of Christopher Colum
bus.
Marcel's art studies are the stellar
feature of the holdovers, and the plaud
its that follow each picture are thun
derous and spontaneous. Mr. Deland
and his four merry maidens continue
in their musical comedy sketch, and i
Hume, Ross and Lewis open the per
formance and have it over and done
with before two-thirds of the audience
are seated.
"Fedora" was on the boards at the
Grand yesterday afternoon and last
night. The audiences were well pleased.
In the part of Loris Ipanhoff, Mel
bourne MacDowell is strong and is well
supported by Ethel Fuller, who gives a
brilliant impersonation of Princess Fe
dora. Aside from the principals, how
ever, the cast is decidedly lacking in
motion. The closing scene of the play,
in which Fedora dies an excruciating
death in the arms of her husband, is
exceptionally' well enacted and might
work strongly on the feelings of an
audience were it not for the presence
of a number of giggling servants, that
change the scene from one of tragedy
to one of comedy. As a whole, however,
the play is well put on.
It was Amelia Gardiner's night at
the California. The opening of the
Morosco stock company's season pre
sented a finely finished piece of work
in Henry V. Esmond's "When We
Were Twenty-One." with credit due to
many on the but Miss Gardiner's
Phyllis was pre-eminent in depth and
charm.
And this is saying much. The com
pany is an excellent one and well bal
anced. Howard Gould's Richard Carew
is admirably conceived and done with
sympathy and strength â never over
done. But those who saw Nat Good
win in the same part missed something
of the latter's complete absorption in
the- character. George Woodward,
Frank McVickars and Harry Mestayer
furnish competent support, especially
in .the first act, where the scene with
the Imp is worth going to see. Thomas
Oberle finds little room in Hirsch for
his well-established ability, but makes
good use of what there is. Theresa
Maxwell as the Firefly triumphs over
an unsympathetic part and compels
applause. Phosa McAllister as Mrs.
Ericson fills a difficult role acceptably.
But the honors of the play belong to
Miss Gardiner. Her command of emo
tion, her natural transitions 'from sim
ple pathos to hysterical laughter and
tears and withal her unfailing sim
plicity and naturalness won her a host
of admirers and rounds of genuine ap
plause.
â¢ In closing he quoted the condemna
tory sayings of famous men of all ages,
and ended with a strong appeal to his
congregation to shun the temptations
the theater affords.
Every available seat was filled last
night, at the Howard-street Methodist
Episcopal Church. There was a de
nunciatory sermon by Rev. A. C. Bane,
who chose for his subject, '"Should
Christians Attend the Theater?"
Stating that having once been a re
porter on one of the papers of a large
city, he knew the subject thoroughly.
He first arraigned the theater as im
moral and appealing to the passions,
as of the world, and therefore leading
away from godliness. He said that by
ridiculing the divinest passion, love, the
theater was responsible for divorces
and unfaithfulness to marriage vows.
He held that it Jests with all the seri'
ous thingsâ with truth, with Scripture,
with life and with death; it teems
with licentiousness and .phrases of
double meaning, so that a pure woman
dare not listen even to the best plays.
He further stated that the moral men
and virtuous women of the. theater
were the very great exception, and that
the greatest playwright, Shakespeare,
was a libertine. The following ex
tracts are from his sermon:
Another evil connected with the theater Is
the over-expenditure of money In the pursuit
of pleasure and In the selection of pleasures
detrimental to health A worldly man meet-
Ing- a profesed Christian at the theater will
ridicule him and comment on his presence.
The 'heater, with its heathen origin and then,
a religious significance, has come down the
ages, becoming more and more corrupt and
demoralized. The church recognizes the evil
Influence of the stage upon life chiefly because
It plays upon the comic and tragic emotions,
making a fal&e representation of life, exag
gerating the passions of love and hate, and
Kmoothing over vice. No church member would
feel pride In having a eon or daughter keej.
company with an actor or an actress, or even
being seen in public with them. Behind the
scenes are seen lewdncss, viclousness, sin,
degradation and diabolical wickedness. An
other strong objection to the theater Is Its
connection with the saloon, and there Is no
theater In this city to-day that has nof a bar
attached. A clergyman on seeing the greatest
actor in the greatest play â Bqoth In one of
Shakespeare' 6 â remarked, "I might possibly
take my wife to see it. but never ray daugh
ter." It has been demonstrated In America
that clean plays will not go. and It is "like
fishing down In a swill barrel to" grasp a
nickel with a hole In it" to find a moral In
the modern play. Music is divine, but the
character of people who sing on the etage is
not above that of those who npeak on the
stage. The theater is retrograding and is de
clared immoral by the secular press, and
shame is cast on the Methodist church to-day
because one of Its eminent workers perished
In the Iroquols Theater fire.
It is proposed to raise these funds
(1) by contributions from members of
the Graduate Association: (2) by con
tributions from outside persons who
recognize the practical usefulness of
this system; (3) by entertainments, and
other similar means devised by the
Graduate Association.
The first of these entertainments will
be given on next Saturday evening,
May 28, at Steinway Hall, in this city.
It is a farce entitled "The Chaperon,"
for which a graduate caste, under di
rection of Mrs. Adele Belgarde Butler,
has been preparing for several months.
The graduates who will take part are
chiefly teachers in the public schools
of the bay cities, as follows: Misses
Clarkson. Levy, Grant, Harrison, Duf
flcy, MacGowan, Tessmer, Flatow,
O'Donnell, Meredith, Mary C. O'Con
nell, Berg, Hopkins, Parker, Lynch,
Irene Carroll, Haynes, Parker.
Through the kindness of Professor
Charles F. Graeber an orchestra will
render selections during the perform
ance.
WAYS AND .MEANS.
No fund of similar character offers
such certainty and quickness of realiz
ing its goals as a fund under these con
ditions. It is not a charity, but a sim
ple business procedure to help tempo
rarily those who are strong and
wealthy in undeveloped capital.
Xo graduate of the San Francisco
State Normal School has never been
without a position if she would accept
one. There are constantly more ap
plications for its graduates than the
school can supply. Consequently, with
good health, a graduate who has bor
rowed enough to carry her through the
school may begin the payment of her
indebtedness immediately upon her
graduation, and thus be furnishing the
means for another student of the same
character to gain the-same foothold.
Therefore a fund of $300 or $500 quickly
becomes a revolving fund, and in the
course of ten or fifteen years one single
fund may be relied upon to have served
in turn several students.
The loan fund ijlan is extremely prac
tical and certain in its results. No
class of scholarships or loan funds in
colleges has the same certainty and
promptness that a dollar invested will
serve its purpose. In two years from
entrance to the normal school, if the
student has the necessary ability to
graduate, it is a practical certainty
that she will be earning an independ
ent livelihood.
The schools of the State need this
type of intelligent and ambitious wo
manhood, and experience in the prep
aration of teachers is showing that the
very best material comes from the
class of young women who have been
obliged to struggle for their education
and opportunities in life. It is to ex
tend at a critical moment a helping
hand to this class of eager self-helpers
that the Gradu.-te Association has de
cided to exert its energies.
The Graduate Association of the San
Francisco State Normal School has un
dertaken to establish loan funds for
the assistance of students without the
necessary means for their support dur
ing attendance at the normal school.
There are constantly being graduated
from the high schools of the State,
particularly in the smaller rural com
munities, bright, ambitious young wo
men, anxious to become trained and
qualified teachers, but who are with
out the $300 to $500 necessary to carry
them through the two years' course. of
a State normal school.
* Some are without relatives and have
managed to struggle along through
the schools in the communities in
which they are known. Others have
widowed mothers or other relatives
who by various devices have managed
to provide food and clothing, but are
unable to furnish the ready money
to pay the expense of living in a
distant city. Instances of this kind
which have been called to the
attention of the authorities are nu
merous, and in many cases pitiful and
pathetic. There are many occupa
tions which a young man may
enter, but the occupations which yield
an independent livelihood for in
telligent young women are few, with
the exception of .teaching, offer
ing generally a mere pittance to be
ginners, and are not as a rule fields
inviting to intelligent and cultured
young women.
