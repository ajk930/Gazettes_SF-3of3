Russia is an* idle dream. "'.. Â¦- \ . /
ST. PETERSBURG.Jah. 5.â There are signs here of grow
ing impatience at the attitude of "Japan. . A report -was current
here 4o-day that* the /Japanese, had made, all preparations for oc
cupying., the; port 1 of Masarnplvo and that we might hear of their
having done v sb at any moment." Should such action take place
on the part of 'the Japanese itSvould bring matters to a climax,
Admiral Alexieff having .full power toact decisively in such case
of provocation. ..... ! , Â¦ - Â¦Â¦-
-At no price would Japan be allowed to occupy Masampho,
whichis a strategical point between Russian fortified towns.
A f act. in the present crisis well worth noting is that the Min
ister of War, General Kuropatkin, is stillhere, whereas, from what
I am told,' he, would proceed forthwith to the Far East in case of
war. If hostilities 'â¢break out he doubtless would be found exer
cising supreme command of - thc.forces in the field, Admiral Alex
ieff having'his hands full 'with other affairs. The Minister of War
is said to be -much in favor of conciliation, if possible, but was
prevailed upon at the "recent council to vote for "war unless^the
late_st' Russian proposals were promptly accepted.
. A general holding high office, who is a friend and confidant
of the Emperor, and, consequently, an. apostle of peace, said, cor
roborating tlie expression of opinion given out a week ago:
"I cannot see any single circumstance which can prevent a
Russo-Japanese war,- which I must deplore and which must needs
be a very severe setback to Russia. But, to. my mind, a greater
danger still is that of war breaking out in western parts."
- He refused to enter into details regarding the last statement.
I; however, am enabled-to give you the key v to the words of
one of the most clear-sighted politicians, who said : ,
I "The Russian Foreign Office is in possession of facts which
show that the Bulgarians have fully made" up their minds to take
advantage of the fact that Russia is occupied' elsewhere to set
the. flame of war alight in the Balkans. It is impossible that th{
powers should avoid becoming involved, - and goodness knows
where it will end. ' ; "'
"1 am authorized to state that instructions have been given
Admiral Evans not to allow the movements of his warships to
be such as to encourage. the Japanese to construe them as mean
ing; support from the United States. This action of the Wash
ington Government is sincerely appreciated here, the conviction
in high quarters being that Japan, unsupported, will not decjare
war.. Russia has nothing but the most friendly feelings toward
the' United States. One of ; her keenest desires is to see the Amer
icans : .developing trade with new' Russia in the Far East."

It is probable that when complete re
turns are in for December. 1503, the last
quarter may show slightly more than
50 per cent of earnings for the same
oeriod of 1301.
The statement of earnings for 1905
shows a great shrinkage in the busi
ness of the corporation. Net earnings
(December estimated) aggregate $103,
979.012 as against $133,30S,763 in 1902 and
$105,947,160 in the first nine months of
the corporation's history* in 1001. Brief
ly, business for the twelve months of
1903 was only about J3.000.000 in excess
of that for the first nine months ef the
corporation's existence.
For the last quarter of 1903 net earn
ings (December estimated at J3.100.0C0)
were 514,845,042, as against 531.4S3.759
for the same quarter of 1901. Thus
earnings for the last quarter were de

LONDON, Jan. 6.â "Nobody will sus

situation taken at Washington is that
the crisis is drifting rapidly to the dan

Â« The action of the United States Gov

proves that the United States Is watch

From a casual inspection of the dif
ferent lights of the group It is believed
that the transfer will admit of a com
plete and radical Improvement in the
service all over the islands. New and
permanent structures will be erected
and a considerable increase in the
number of lights is contemplated. Hilo
harbor will certainly get a light of the
third order and Honolulu one. possibly
of the first. Pearl Harbor, which now
has no permanent light, will probably
have one of the first rank. Owing, it is
said, to the expectation of the absorp
tlon'of the lights by the United States,
the service has somewhat run down
and too often has been left to the
charge of individuals and municipali
ties to keep up to the required stand
ard. The new superintendent of the
Hawaiian service is not yet named,
though the appointment cannot be de
layed for a great while, as the emer
gency is considered great. With the
assumption of the Government In
charge the service will, it is believed,
be increased in efficiency and made
modern in every respect.
RADICAL IMPROVEMENT.
In the transfer it was stipulated that
light keepers now in charge should be
retained and that the United States
should assume the expense of main
taining the lights from the time of tak
ing charge. At this time there are but
eightren lights of all kinds established
in the islands, not one being of the
first order or above third. Three houses
only are in permanent structures. All
the rest are of wood and none of these
is in first-class condition. Many of the
lights "'are suspended from poles or
exhibited from framework structures."
th<* longest range of any one b^lng at
Diamond Head, which is visible at a
distance of fifteen nautical miles and
is situated 145 feet above sea level. The
loftiest of all is the Paukaa. light, at
the entrance of Hilo harbor, which 13
170 feet above sea level, but has a
range of but five miles. .
On the island of Hawaii there are but
seven lights altogether, but one of
which is permanently housed. Maul
has two lights, both in rough wooden
structures. Molokai has one light of
the fourth order and one harbor light.
Oahu has two. housed In stone tow
ers, and five of all sorts altogether,
while Kauai island has one with a.
framework of wood. and. Layman Island
one, maintained by a private corpora
tion from April to September.
KEEPERS .TO BE RETAINED.
New Tear's witnessed the accession
of the United States Department â¢ of
Commerce to the control of all the
lighthouses of the Hawaiian Islands,
which are hereafter to be supported
and administered in common with all
others of the nation. The new district
is to be attached, at least for the pres
ent, to the Twelfth Lighthouse District,
which embraces California, with head
quarters at San Francisco. Colonel J.
F. Hanbury is now in charge. The
new official who is to have the island
district in charge has not yet been
designated, but is expected to arrive at
an early day. He will assume charge
of all the properties and make all nec
essary provision for maintenance.
Upon his recommendation depend9 the
nature of changes contemplated in or
der to bring the district up to the high
est standard. Some of the old lights, it
is said, will be increased In power and
new ones added and many changes in
the character and position of the Iight3
are Imminent. A thorough Inspection
of all existing lights is to be made at
once.

DENVER, Jan. 5. â Angry because he
had been punished by his teacher. Wal
ter Dale, the 14-year-old son of a brick
contractor, committed suicide in the
Wheatridge School this afternoon by
swallowing carbolic acid. After taking
the drug he walked defiantly to his
seat, surrounded by his excited class
mates.

boy were his brother and two sisters,

Is a prosperous contractor and has

home life was; apparently rleasant,
but despite his favorable surroundings
the boy developed a temper and dispo
sition in which sullenness was domi
nant. He refused to obey his teacher,
Mrs. Mary D. Finger, and as a conse
quence was reprimanded on several oc-v
caslons. Yesterday he was rebuked by
the teacher for some transgression of
the rules and submitted with bad grace.
When the teacher had' finished her
reprimand the boy took out his knife
and deliberately slit his clothing to
display his vindictive and bitter re
sentment of the scolding.
During the morning session to-day
he showed a number of girls a bottle',
which, he said, contained carbolic acid.
Shortly afterward, while at recess, he
swallowed the poison. He returned to
the room and his teacher immediately
detected that something, was wrong
and telephoned for a doctor. The phy

PLANTS TO BE IMPROVED
It is felt by officials of the, admin
istration that it would be improper
publicly to discuss a subject so delicate
as that which Is pending between
Japan and Russia, in which, too. the
United States is not one of the prin
cipal parties.
This Government's relations with the
controversy are purely commercial.
If war between Japan and Russia
should result, while.lt is not expected
that, even in a remote way, the United
States would be drawn into it. efforts
certainly would be made by this Gov
ernment to protect its commerce in the
Far East.*
,To afford this protection in such a
way as not to offend either nation party
to the war. both of which are on friend-,
ly terms with the United States, would
be a delicate and difficult task.. It is
not unlikely that this subject will be
considered at future meetings of the
President and his. Cabinet.
careful consideration was given to the
situation in the Far East to-day by
the President and his Cabinet. The
Information, received through diplo
matic channels is most carefully guard
ed. At the conclusion of the Cabinet
meeting the members were unusually
reticent.

John Jaeger, well known throughout
the United States as mining stock
brokers and promoters, were arrested
to-day on the complaint of Postoflice
Inspector Ketcham on the charge of
using the mails in a scheme to defraud.
Korea, the charge d'affaires further
declared, would never agree to Russia's

Northern Korea, as it would prejudice
the sovereigny of Korea, which is guar
anteed by the Anglo-Chinese treaty. -'
; Advices received from Seoul by . the
charge d'affaires as late as -two 'days
ago did not mention the possibility of
Japan landing troops at Masampho, and
the charge d'affaires did not believe
war would resul 1 . from the present ne
gotiations.
The Korean charge d'affaires, in an
interview, says he has good reason to
believe that the negotiations between
Korea and the United -States, Great
Britain, Japan and Russia, regarding
Wiju and Yongampho, will result in the
opening of those ports at an early date.
Russia, he adds* is still opposing the
opening and a few Russian troops have
occupied Yongampho, but He believes
the negotiations will terminate in a de
cision favorable to the views of Korea
and the. powers esiring the opening of
â¢the orts.
LONDON. Jan. 5. â The statement
made by the Foreign Office in St. Pe
tersburg to the press to-day regarding
the instructions sent to Viceroy Alex
ieff was communicated to the British
Foreign Office i.nd to the Japanese le
gation here. Both expressed pleasure
at the fact that Russia' had evinced
such a friendly, attitude, but they said
no definite conclusions could be -drawn
until the nature of the counter propo
sals were known. The Japanese lega
tion reiterated that the cardinal points
of the Japanese proposals admitted of
no counter proposals, but said that if
the serious points were included among
those accepted there was a possibility
of reaching a settlement by further ne
gotiations..
Not Disposed to Accept Peace Assu
rances From St. Petersburg.
BKITOXS ARE SKEPTICAL.
"The preparations for the embarka
tion of two divisions of Japanese troops
are continuing actively. It is believed
they will be dispatched to ports in
South Korea to restore order."
Owing to the absence of details re
gai-ding the Russian reply the officials
here are careful not to express an
opinion as to the outcome, but the gen
eral tone of the comment in official
circles is slightly less hopeful. The
most significant feature of a dispatch
from Tokio is the statement that Japan
is hastening fintrl preparations for a
far more, extensive dispatch of troops
to Korea than was at first contem-:
plated. The Government has now de
cided to send an army of 35.000 men,
organized as two divisions, to Korea.
This is- more than double the strength
of the expedition first contemplated,
and requires a large fleet of transports
and extensive arrangements which are
proceeding rapidly , toward completion.
The destination of this army is expect
ed to be Southern Korea, particularly
Fusan and Masampho. The officials
here. at first understood that Russia
would not object to the dispatch of the
expedition, but the magnitude of the
plans begins to raise some doubt as to
whether Russia will acquiesce*. Al
though no positive advices have been
given of the preparations for the dis
patch of this large army the reports
excite some apprehension, as it is said
it may develop into the first outward
act of the impending conflict.
Rumors are in circulation at Mar
seilles that a French naval division,
composed of the armored cruisers Kle-.
ber, Desaix and Admiral Aube and the
turret ship Suffern. is about to receive
orders to sail for the Far East. The
reports, however, cannot be confirmed
here, but there is reason to believe that
the naval authorities are considering
the disposition of the warships in the
event of a warlike turn. in the situation.
This is due mainly to the present small
French naval force in the Pacific, which
is confined to two unimportant vessels.
A dispatch to the Havas Agency from
Tokio to-day says:
The diplomat who gave the press the
foregoing Information expressed him
self as confident that Russia in her re
ply to Japan would give way on. this
vital point. â¢
Japan, however, saw no reason why
the proposed neutral zone should be
established, holding that the entire
peninsula should be subject to her pre
ponderating influence.
The attitude of Russia is believed to
be due to the one fact that if Japan
control Korea she will thereby be able
to more easily menace Port Arthur as
well as Vladivostok.
/ PARIS. Jan. 5.â It developed to-day
that the greatest difference between
Russia and Japan arises from the pro
posal made by Russia that a neutral
zone shall be established, extending
from Ping Yang, in Korea, on the
south, to the Russian frontier on the
north. The Russian Government has
expressed a willingness to recognize the
preponderating influence of Japan in
the remainder of Korea and the two
powers are agreed respecting the prin
ciple of the integrity of China and of
Korea.

make landing of any force impossible.
The correspondent, after noting the ar
rivals of reinforcements and warlike
preparations, says' much anxiety is be
ing felt by Russians because of the
anti-Russian activity on the part of
China.
The Jimnim stated that' the* Tokio
arsenal had received an urgent order
from the military authorities for SO.000
horseshoes. The significance of this
order lies in the fact that the shoes
were not to be of ordinary type, but
sharpened for use in an ice-bound
country. The Japanese warships at
Sfarabo have been docked one after the
other and their bottoms treated with
some special preparation. : .:â¢
The banks of Japan have been cau-.
tioned by the Government against
making too free loans, as a war loan
might be required by the, authorities.
It was officially announced that the
Japanese Government had decided to
rush construction of the Seoul-Fusan
Railroad in Korea, This was to have
been finished in 1906, but is now ex
pected to be finished by next year. The
road is considered of the highest strat
egical importance.

The newspapers were filled, with re
ports of engagements of transports,
mobilization of troops, stocking with

war. Some were undoubtedly exagger
ations, but there was no doubt that
Japan was putting the final touches on
her formidable sea and land arma
ments. On "December 24 the Chuwo

emptorily chartered the Chiho Maru,
2300 tons, and that other vessels would

VRufesia's recent course demonstrates
the [unsatisfactory nature . of present

Ta-Tong-Kdw^have. undoubtedly had
the effect of intimidating China and of
preventing lier fulfilling her treaty ob
ligations with the -United States and
Japan with respect to the opening of
those places, to the .commerce of the
world. As regards Korea, it is now
known that the Joint efforts of Great
Britain, the United States and Japan
to open the Yalu' to foreign commerce
were on the evÂ« of success when the
Russian occupation ..' of ; Yongampho
blocked the plans for the- time being.
These and similar events in Korea and
Manchuria justify the apprehension
that if "affairs be permitted to proceed
uninterruptedly in their present course
a large part of the shores of the Yel
low Sea, not to mention the interior of
Manchuria, will be closed to the com
merce of the civilized world. It is of
vital importance to Japan that this
should not occur, and it is plain that
the final issue depends solt-ly upon
Russia's willingness to recognize this
fact." â¢ .
EXCITEMENT IX JAPAN.
' " It. js difficult to perceive how Japan
cnuld possibly accept this proposal. To

joyment of the rights and immunities

irjnild^^be impossible to leave to the
caprjee of "a tKird power.
"Russia's reply has evidently been
a surprise and a disappointment to Ja
pan. It is now generally understood
that Russia has virtually refused to
discuss the situation in Manchuria, and
has proposed something in the nature
of a neutral .zone in Northern Korea,
on the Manchurian frontier, extending
as far as Wongtan on the east and
Pingyang on the west.
Statement of Tokio Government's
Position in the Controversy.
NEW TORK, Jan. 5. â The Associated
Pr,ess has been supplied with the fol
lowing statement of Japan's view of
its present contention with Russia by
one who is in constant communication
with Tokio and whose knowledge of
Japanese affairs and Intimacy with
prominent Japanese give weight to his
opinion:
"The negotiations between Russia
and Japan have reached a critical
stage, although an. amicable 'adjust
ment is still possible. Russia's reply
to Japan's latest representations will
decide the issue. While neither Gov
ernment has taken the public into its
confidence, it is .not difficult to sur
mise the general tenor of the . views
which the Japanese Government would
express. Something in the nature, of
bh agreement between the two govern
ments, whereby they bind th'emselves
to respect the independence and terrir
torial integrity of both China and Ko
rea, would naturally come first. Such
an agreement would probably include
also mutual recognition of the special
interests of Russia in Manchuria and
frf Japan in Korea, coupled with an
agreement based on the principles of
equality of all nations as regards com
mercial opportunities in those coun
tries; that neither contracting party
shall interfere with the commercial
rights of the other acquired by treaty
with China or Korea. In a word, it is
probably the fact that Japan has asked
no more of Russia than confirmation
by international compact of declara
tions repeatedly and unequivocally
mado by Russia herself regarding the
unselfish nature of her motives with
reference to Manchuria.

OMAHA, Xebr., Jan. 5. â It was semi
officially stated to-day that E. H. Har
rimah will become president of the
Union Pacific Railroad, to succeed Hor
ace G. Burt, whose resignation was
recently announced. A general man
ager will be named who will be the
actual head of the affairs of the road,
with headquarters in Omaha. The road
will be operated by a method similar
to that in vogue on the Southern Pa
cific Railroad. Harriman's Incumbency,
it' is said, will be -for one year, at the
and of which period his permanent suc
cessor. Jf any, will be named.
President Burt, when asked if it were
true that Mr. Harriman would succeed
him as president of the Union Pacific,
said he had no official information to
that effect, nor had he been informed
of any intended action of the board of
directors. Another official at the Union
Pacific headquarters, however, ex
pressed the belief that Harriman would
in the future direct the affairs of the
road and that the active head would
be a vice president or general manager.

the Coroner's jury and attorneys for
the relatives of those who died declare
that a verdict should be given in each

Evidence showing grosser criminal
neglect -than anything previously de
veloped was given under oaf h to-day
in the Fire Department investigation.
Joseph Daugherty, who aad charge of
the curtain, swore that two w*eks ago.
during a matinee performance, there
was a fire on the stags and 'when he
attempted to lower the asbestos curtain
It was stopped by the same obstruction
that prevented . its operation last
Wednesday, the fatal afternoon.
The curtain manager declared that
he protested at that time, but that no
attention was paid to his warning.' In
his opinion, if the curtain had been
run down during the. Wednesday mati
nee the lives of many. If not all, of the
victims of the disaster might have been
saved. It was only by the merest
chance that a panic was averted as
the result of the first fire. The skylight
at that time, he said, was securely
closed.
WILIj AFFECT INSURANCE.
"I wish it understood," he said, "that
this is not a trial, but simply an in
auiry to determine the facts of the
fire, as far as we can. The Coroner's
jury will not attempt to fix the blame
for the fire upon anybody, nor will it
recommend the punishment of anybody.
It will simply report on the facts as
it shall have been able to gather them
.and the rest of the work will be left
for the S&te's Attorney, Jf it be found
that there is anything for him to do."
According to the managers of the
local theaters the closing of the play
houses in this city has disarranged the
theatrical business of the entire coun
try. Companies that have been booked
for this city for the next fortnight are
: either suspended or are being sent to
other cities, thus forcing: other com
panies to change their routes.
Attorneys for the Fuller Company
took Jones, who had been sought by
the police for several days, to the Fire
Department. It had been charged that
Jones and his men broke the skylights
on the theater after the fire in order to
destroy possible evidence. It developed
to-day after the arrest of Jones and his
men that the skylights were blocked by
scantlings and tied with wire to pre
vent their opening and that neither of
them had been opened since the theater
was built.
Jones In making his statement to the
FireÂ»Department said:
"I took the three ironworkers with
me up through an adjoining building
and out upon the theater roof over the
stage. First I removed the wooden
scantlings which blocked the skylights.
Then I found Â«he lights tied with wire
mside and broke two panes of glass to
get at the wires to untie them. I finally
~ot the wires off and opened the
fight?."
WITNESS BECOMES CONFUSED.
Jones was asked why he went to the
roof of the theater and replied that he
had been told that the north wall had
cracked in the fire and went to see if it
were true. He declared he had loosened
the skylights because he feared they
intent- fall through and injure some
body on the stage.
"Why did you take three ironworkers
with you to inspect a brick wall?"
asked Attorney Fulkerson of the Fire
Department.
Jones was confused, but finally an
swered that the men went with him
through curiosity.
Numerous witnesses who were in ad
joining buildings overlooking the # the
ater testified that the skylights were
net open during the fire.
Coroner Traeger said to-night that
he was almost ready for the inquest,
which will commence Thursday morn
ing.
Aldernian Friestedt declared:
"Some of the leading theaters in Chi
Â¦cago cannot conform to the ordinances
unless they are entirely rebuilt, and
they, may find it too expensive to make
the changes. I do not believe more than
35 per cent of them will ever open again
anyhow." ' ,.'. :
POLICE MAKE FOUR ARRESTS.
Late this afternoon the attorneys of
the Fire Department caused the arrest
of four employes of the Fuller Con
struction Company â David Jones, a
masonry foreman, and Angus McKay,
Otto Rausch and John Kingston, iron
workers.
CHICAGO, Jan. 3.â The special com
mittee, composed of the members of
the City Council, appointed last night
to investigate the condition of the local
theaters and report upon what altera
tions are necessary to make them con
form to the building ordinances held its
first meeting to-day.
According to the statement of Alder
man Friestedt, one of the members of
the committee, it is doubtful if 35 per
cent of the theaters ever will reopen
their doors. Strict adherence to the
building laws would require that every
one of the playhouses in the city be of
fireproof construction and would
require the demolition and rebuilding
of the majority of the theaters. Alder
man Jones, chairman of the committee,
said to-night:
"We will first revise the buildinr or
dinances. Then we will visit the the
aters and decide what alterations will
be necessary to make the construction
of the house confonn to the law. Of
course, the owners .of theaters will do
nothing until they know Just exactly
what the city aldermen will demand
of them, but they will be obliged to re
construct their theaters to conform
with the ordinances."
The first damage suit against the
proprietors of the Iroquois Theater and
the city of Chicago growing out of the
fire has been filed by Ivy Owens, as
administrator of the estates of Miss
Amy Owens and Mr*. Frances E. Ow
ens, her mother. The action is for the

.WASHINGTON. Jan. 5.âPractical
ly ;he entire session of the Senate to
day was devoted to a speech by Lodge
on the- situation on the isthmus of
Panama
Lodgo began his speech on Panama
by quoting a number of authorities in
support of his position that the Presi
dent flkd not departed from the beaten
paths in recognizing the independence
of Panama. Lodg<? laid down the gen
eral proposition that *"a revolted state
may be recognized as sovereign or in-
A> pendent by a neutral power without
departing from Its attitude of neutral
ity." He also contended that such an
act could not be construed as provok
ing war.
Lodge contended that it was estab
lished that a new state should be rec
ognized whenever a new state were
sufficiently established to assume inter
national obligations and whenever rec
ognition formed the dictates of pru
dence and good policy. He also laid
down as a general rule observed by the
United States the fact that a de facto
Government was the de jure Govern
n.Â«>nt. He contended that the recogni
tion of any state was one to be deter
mined entirely by the recognizing
power â by its inclination a.nd judgment,
independent of all other considerations.
Many instances in which recognition
had been purely executive were cited
and the Senator asserted that Presi
dent Taylor had prepared to recognize
th- independence of Hungary before a
Government had been established.
Replying to the objection that the
President had gone beyond his author
ity in nominating a. Minister to Pan
ama Lodge quoted a numbfr of in
stances to show that the early Presi
dents mad? nomination? to other coun
tries for which Congress had made no
provision.
BOGOTAS DOUBLE DEALING.
The Senator discussed at length the
action of President Roosevelt in con
nection with thÂ» Panama revolt. He
said that the act of Congress had been
an instruction to secure a canal at a
certain point. No objection had been
made to the Hay-Herran treaty, except
that too great concessions had been
rr.ade. to Colombia, and. notwithstand
ing these concessions, the treaty had
be^n summarily rejected by the Colom
bian <*onÂ«:ress. Colombia had from the
start nought to secure more money for
the canal ncht. Lodge asserted, and
hÂ» quoted Minister Beaupres corre
pr>cr.cience !n support of this statement.
Not onlv had there been an effort to
secure more from the United States,
bet there also was an attempt to
' squeez-" the Panama Canal Company.
This waÂ« the attitude of the Colom
bian Government, he said, and he
â¢al>d attention to the fact that that
[>.vÂ«r'T,or.r had talrfn that nositicn
after asking the United States to enter
into the negotiation of the treaty.
Lodge aliv,- referred to the effort on
the part of Colombia to obtain a prom
ise from Germany and Great Britain
to take up the canal prelect. Lodge
dwelt at some length on this incident,
declaring that the invitation tothe Eu
ropean powers to build a canal on the
western hemisphere by a people whose
very existence depended upon the main
tenance of the Monroe doctrine was
very extraordinary.
MORGAN* ASKS A QUESTION".
Lodge read from a speech made by
Morgan in the Fifty-seventh Congress,
protesting against the ratification of
the treaty with Colombia. Morgan con
strued Lodge's action to be an infer
ence that he (Morgan) had altered his
views concerning the rights of Panama
to thÂ» proceeds of the sale of the ca
nal concession. Explaining that ne had
not changed fn any particular his views
on the matter. Morgan snid he sup
posed the speech had been brought into
debate for the purpose of reproaching
him. He then asked Lodge:
"In the absence of any agreement
with condemned felons in France con
stituting the Panama Canal Company,
would you be willing now to take this
$40,000,000 to be paid by the United
States and give it to the republic of
Panama?"
Lodge answered that he would not be
willing to so divert money which he be
lieved to belong rightfully to the Pan
ama Canal Company.
Taking up the events immediately
preceding recognition, he asserted that
Minister Beaupre had reported that the
revolution was supposed at Bogota to
have broken out on October 31. As early
as May all the world had known that
revolution was impending if thÂ» treaty
were not ratified. Those reports, of
course, had come to the ears of the
President, and the Senator asserted
that if the President had not taken pre
cautionary measures he would have
been in the highest degree censurable.
The precaution had resulted in the
presence of only one United States ves
sel at Colon and the utmost impartial
ity had been shown by the American of
ficials there. As a matter of fact, there
had b?en no war in Panama. On the
contrary, peace had been preserved and
the result had been that the new repub
lic was established without bloodshed,
except the killing of one me-..
ALL AMERICANS INTERESTED.
Ix)dge declared the question involved
to be an American question and one in
which the whole American people were
deeply interested. The canal, he said,
gave us an interest in the isthmus
which could not be overestimated. It
gave us practically a continuous coast

believe Colombia should stand across
the pathway cf the progress of the
world. For the life of hi '.. - could not

I thought of what a, pleasure '.I would be
to contrast the policy which tried to set up>
Uliuokalanl In Hawaii with the policy of the
Republican party, which has made those Isl
ands a part of ihe United State*; to contrast
the tariff which they passed and whjch their
own President called the tariff of perfidy and
dishonor, with the tariff we passed: to exam
ine the history of the loans which they made
in a time of profound peace to the bankers of
New York, with an interest rate far above
what th? United States could borrow at even
then, ami contrast them with the loans which
we made in time of war: and then compare
that era of panic and depression with the
prosperity which followed.
We can fay what we want about the silver
issue, but It was a better issue for the Dem
ocratic party to meet the country on than the
one cone before: and when I saw the accounts
of thiÂ« delightful banquet in New York and
read those inspiring speeches and observed the
Democratic party ence more through its
cboeen leaders there preparing to stand across
the pathway of American progress and propos
ing to nut at their head the man who held
power last in their name. I confess my spirits
roiÂ»Â« higher than ever about the Republican
prospects.
And 1 look forward with great interest and
Â«reat pleasure to the picture that was drawn
at that dinner by the Secretary of State when
he euloeiied the last Democratic President.
Apparently In twenty years he is the only
canuidtte they fan produce, and Mr. Olney
" Mms to think he is the only one they can
run. A\ naiever his strength, or whatever his
weakness. I cannot refrain from saying that
hie nomination would present me at least with
one great source of pleasure. His administration
has never been discussed. I do not regard the
Democratic party â mid I suppose this Is a.
parUsax. remark, but I shall make It â aÂ« al
ways abounding; In g-nod sense, but they ha<l
too much sense to fight the campaign of lSfrti
on Mr. Cleveland's administration. They re
pudiated him and his administration and we
are deprived of the opportunity of dlscuss
inc it. i
MISTAKES OF CLEVELAND.
Needles* war with Spain'. Mr. President. I
am Inclined to think that adjective was well
chosen. If, when the first Â«t!rrings for Inde
pendence had come on that island the adminis
tration of Mr. Cleveland had behaved with
sense and courage; if they had told Spain
that the time had come when the United States
could no longer hold back and that Cuba must
be free. 1 beiieved then and fcelleve now that
OJba would have obtained her Independence
perhaps after scraa protracted negotiations, but
without any war between us. 1 have always
believed that if that administration, instead cf
taking counsel with the Minister of Spain and
with a great bugar planter in Cuba, had been
guided by a sound, brave American spirit be
rct-e fcpain had squandered blood and treasur*
In the island, we might, indeed, have been
saved from the war.
Among ethers present vaf a very distin
guished citizen of my own State, whom 1 am
\ery proud and happy to call my personal
friend. 1 very rarely agree with him on any
political question, but he made a statement
last n'.grht with which I think 1 am In more or
!esÂ» agreement. He refeired In a picturesque
way to the dreadful career that haa been run
by the Republican party elnce It cam- into
power in ibOi!. He said it had passed from a
needless war with Spain to a canton war with
Colombia.
see the wisdom of the course of some
of the Democrats in this instance. As
a Republican he would like no better
issue in the pending Presidential cam
paign than the Panama canal, but as
an American he would regret a division
on this important question.

The Clothes Question
Did you ever seriously consider whether or
not you were paying too much for your clothes ?
Your purse determines whether you are pay-
ing too muchâ you know what you can afford.
There is one thing sure: If you are not hav-
ing us make your clothes you are paying more
than you need to.
Other tailors buy their cloth from jobbers.
The jobber makes his' profit.
We buy our cloth direct from the mills and
are the only tailors in San Francisco that do not
buy from jobbers.
We save you from $> to $10 on a suit
If the evidence is not in the garments you
don't need to keep the clothes.
We'll make you a stylish double-breasted suit
like here pictured for $12 and guarantee the fit
Our prices range from $10 to S4J.

$20,000 slander suit of Mrs. Francis Hall
against Catherine T. Williams.
The complainant will have to pay the
cost of the suit.
The case has consumed two weeks of
actual trial and has been bitterly con
tested. Mrs. Hall alleged that Mrs.
Williams had defamed her character in
the neighborhood in which they live
by talking, about her. Specific allega
tions were made of what it was alleged
Mrs. Williams said. These, the jury
held, had not been proven.
The", arguments were finished by .'3
o'clock this afternoon and an hour later
the instructions had been read and the
case submitted- to the Jury for its de

cast. The first stood 11 to 1, the second
was unanimously for the defendant and

BEAUTIFUL GOWNS.
OAKLAND, Jan. 5.â The marriage of
Miss Maud Cheek of this city and
James Philip Sisson of Hawaii was sol
emnized this evening atÂ» the home of
the bride's mother, ,Mrs. Sarah B>
Cheek. It was the first large event
of social Importance since the begin
ning of the new year and was a bril
liant affair. The spacious rooms"-of the
Castro-street residence were beautifully
decorated, the arrangement of aspara
gus ferns and pink chrysanthemums
being strikingly graceful and artistic. <
The most attractive work was that
in which the happy pair plighted their
troth. From one corner; of the front
drawing-room a canopy of smilax pro
jected over the bridal party, the apex
of the triangle beingr caught up with
a huge bow of pink chiffon, from which
hung three largo bells, also of pink
chiffon. Another interesting feature of
the decorations was a chime of silver
toned bells that were suspended in the
arch .between the two drawing-rooms.
Scarlet berries and delicate ferns were
blended prettily to adorn the hall and
dining-room.
The bride is a tall, slender girl, with
very dark hair and eyes, and the bridal
white was more .than becoming. Her
gown .was of chiffon; lhe several rows
of shirrinz drawing the skirt into
â¢graceful folds. The transparent yoke
of shirred tulle was outlined with a
wide bertha of duchesse lace. A single 7
cluster of natural orange blossoms held
the veil in place and the bridal bou
quet was a shower of lilies of the val
ley.
Miss Grace Cheek attended her sister
as maid of honor and her rrbek of
white organdie was the daintiest cre
ation imaginable. The shirred skirt
was made over two other skirts of or
gandie and lace~and a cape effect waa
given to the bodice by means of the
long Van Dyke points of the lace edged
collar. Bride roses in her bouquet
gave the only touch of color to the

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
The cases will receive the attention of
the authorities for proper disposition.
Whether the boys will be turned over
to the Juvenile Court will be deter
mined when they are taken before the
Police Court to-morrow.
Helplessly intoxicated, Vivian Dun
can, 11 years old, and, Tony Soares, 14
years of age, were arrested this after
noon at West Oakland by Patrolman
McKeegan. The younger of the boys
was staggering and maudlin from the
effects of liquor and his companion was
go badly overcome that" he' had to be
carried in the arms of the " policeman
to the patrol wagon.
The boys' youth and their condition
caused an immediate investigation by
the police to ascertain where liquor
had been procured. It was traced to
the Duncan' boy's home at 805% Grove
street. There, according to the people
in *he house, Vivian had taken a demi
john of wine that stood in a closet and,
with the assistance of Sbares, ; about
emptied the vessel. Very quickly the
liquor took effect and the youths wan
dered toward West Oakland, becoming
drunker and drunker every minute.
Public attention was first attracted
to the pair : at Adeline-street station,
where they were seen trying to steal
cigars from a case In the Southern Pa
cific Company's ticket agency. Leaving
there the boys drifted apart. Police
man McKeegan was notified and start
ed In pursuit of the lads. He found
Soares a few blocks west on Seventh
street and sent him to the city prison
and soon afterward landed Duncan.
After Duncan had refcovered his
speech he told the police that he had
taken the wine from his home and had
drank freely of the intoxicating bever
age, Soares taking part In the debauch.

As soon as the legal steps can be
completed the work on this system will
be commenced and the relief which has
been so strenuously demanded by the
conditions in the district will be srlven.
The Council's plan of relief calls for
drainage sewers on East Twenty
fourth and East Twenty-fitth streets,
from Nineteenth to Twenty-lirst ave
nues, with outlets through Nineteenth
and Twenty-first avenues from East
Twenty-third to East Twenty-seventh
streets. Cross drains will be used to
carry off the surface waters into Sau
sal Creek by way of East Twenty-first
street.
The City Council has called for bids
for the construction of a system of
drainage sewers, storm' water and san
itary, for. the relief of the Twenty-third
avenue district, that for year after. year
has. been flooded by the winter, rains,
making East Fourteenth street a sea
and in many places impassable.
This work the Council has ordered is
on the watershed that is to be drained
outside of the city limits by lateral
sewer3 to be constructed by the Board
of ; Supervisors. -. It â¢ is from the hill
slopes back of the Twenty-third avenue
territory that the bulk of the heavy
volume of surface water flows into -the

FRESNO, Jan. 5.â The opening of the
second day's proceedings of the fourth
annual convention of the California
State Federation of Labor was marked
by a much larger attendance than at
the opening meeting. Among the vis
itors present this morning was Mayor
Eugene E. Schmitz of San Francisco,
who arrived last night on the Owl
and was welcomed by a committee from
the local unions. He was driven to his
quarters at the Hughes Hotel, where
ah informal reception was tendered him
in. the lobby.
The, president announced the follow
ing appointments: . L. B. Leavltt of
Vallejo and O. W. McCaslin of Napa.
sergeants-at-arms, and W. S. Smith of
Los Angeles, reading clerk.
The committee on resolutions then
made its report. A resolution recom
mending that a general movement for
a Saturday half holiday throughout
California was adopted. A resolution
asking that the State Federation of
Labor present a bill at the next Legis
lature recommending that eight hours
shall constitute a day's work was
referred to the law and legislative com
mittee with the approval of the conven
tion.
A resolution asking that the State or
ganizer be instructed to include the or
ganizing of women's union label leagues
precipitated a lively discussion, which
resulted in the recommendations being
adopted. The resolution asking ,the
convention to indorse the boycott de
clared by the Stablemen's Union and
the San Francisco Labor Council
against a special delivery company of
that city caused a heated discussion.
The resolution for the drafting of
amendments to the State constitution
making it incumbent upon contractors
performing municipal labor to employ
none but actual voters residing in the
municipality was referred to the law
and legislative committee.
j On I the r recommendation of the com
mittee a" "resolution requesting the
school boards in the State to close the
schools riot' later than the second Fri
day in. July and to reopen two months
.later was rejected, though not without
protest. . 'â¢ ".
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 5.â Mayor W.
J. Hassett has undertaken a movement
to fill up China Slough, which for half
a century has been a disease breeding
nuisance in the most conspicuous por
tion of the city. Much of the surface
of the slough is owned 'by the South
ern Pacific Company, and by letters
which he received from the railroad
officials several .weeks ago Mayor Has
sett-shows the company is willing to
pay the expense of filling its* portion
of the sloueh if the city will condemn
the remainder and lay it out as a public
park. The* company's share will be
330,000 cubic yards, and the city's share
will be less than 15,00o cubic yards.
In a message to the Board of Trus
tees on the subject Mayor Hassett says
it is in the province of the board to
secure ' the eradication of the plague
spot by "fair and honorable means,"
and that .to antagonize, the. railroad
company in the matter at this critical
stage of the proceedings "by indulging
in blatant and violent mouthlngs would
only defeat the object sought to be ac
complished, the success of which means
so much for the city's advancement."
Mayor Hassetfs remarks were ' in
duced by speeches recently made, by a
couple of Trustees ' in which it was
made to ' appear â¢ that- the city proposed
to, put into effect a general policy of
antagonism to" the Southern Pacific

the stable owners meet, the,y will give
a decision in regard to the reduction of
work asked by the union. The union
men refuse to do any more work than
was specified in their agreement with
their employers. They claim that they
have been compelled to remove refuse
from the stables and assist in bringing
feed for the animals during slack hours.
Should the proprietors refuse to accede
to their demands they will undoubtedly
go on strike.

A strike among the boilermakers and
iron shipbuilders may soon occur if
their employers do not consent to an
Increase over the present scale of
wages. The men are said to be about'
to demand $3 50 a nine-hour day fÂ»Â«r
all inside work and $3 50 and an efght
hour day for all outside work. At th<*
present time the men are receiving
$3 25 for inside work and $3 50 for out-^
side work, with nine-hour days pre
vailing in both cases.
The managers of the Union and the
Risdon Iron works are said to be in
dread of a strike at the present time,
for both concerns have a lot of work
on hand which they are anxious to
finish at once. If the men decide to
strike the work cannot be completed
and this will mean a big loss to both
concerns. .:'-"â¢: .;,
There nre a lot of non-union work
men employed at both shipyards, as
well as many of the other places aoout
town, and trouble may resuli if thr'se
men attempt to work while the union
men are out on strike.

CHICO, Jan. 3. â Louis Van Vlack.
a prominent contractor and builder,
was dangerously stabbed to-day at
noon by W. E. Ratekin, a plasterer
and brickmason. The trouble , be
tween the two men grew out of a dis
agreement regarding a settlement,
Ratekin having surrendered a con
tract which he held under Van Vlack.
The affray took place in the basement
of an unfinished house and there were
no eye-witnesses. Van Vlack left
the building after being wounded and
walked nearly four blocks to a physi
cian's office, leaving a trail of blood.
He was stabbed twice in the left side,
close to the heart, and the lung was
penetrated. Both wounds bled pro

is much less serious, although it," too,
is a stab and not a slash.
Ratekin was arrested by Officer
White and locked in the city prison.

Mrs. Thomas Evans and her six.-year
old daughter, who were tak^n from
thÂ«-ir home Â«t Anaconda to the bull
pen yesterday for jeering at soldiers
and non-union miners, have been re
leased by the military authorities af

GEORGETOWN, Colo.. Jan. j. â
The tri^l of the union miners charged
â¢with blowing up the converter build
ing of the Sun and Moon mine at Ida
ho Springs was resumed in the Dis
trict Court h<*re to-day. The only
sensational testimony presented was
that of A. H. Colburn, an Idaho
Springs blacksmith, who testified that
J. E. Chandjer, secretary of the Idaho
Springs Miners' Union, told him be
fore the explosion that if the Sun and
Moon mine was reopened with non
union miners he (Chandler) would
see to it that it was blown up.
It is said that the prosecution ex
pects to finish its case by Thursday.
Th*> defense has eleven witnesses to
introduce.
First, that the sale was made by
Stratton to a company of which he was
a member, payment being made in
stock, it being held that a man cannot
defraud himself; second, the mine has
produced $10,100,000 in gold since the
sale, which is more than the selling
price; third, the present suit was filed
against the executors of the estate be
fore they had qualified; fourth, the
death of Stratton before the filing of
the suit ended, according to English
law, under which the company is in
corporated, any rights to demand any
damage the company may have had.
Riner held that any one of the four
grounds for defense was sufficient. The
attorneys for the plaintiff were given
permission to present arguments on a
bill of exceptions to-morrow.
DENVER. Jan. 5.â In the case of the
Stratton Independence Mining Com
pany of London- against the executors
of the estate of the late Wlnfjeld S.
Stratton, the Cripple Cr^ek millionaire,
claiming $61000,000 damages for the al
leged "salting" of the Independence
mine before its sale to the English
company, Judge Riner in the United
States court to-day decided for the de
fendants. The grounds for the defense
were:
Judce -Advocate General Dudley Mates that
the concession . to this institution : wan never
completed -by the 'signature of .-the Spanish
Governor -General." The president of the com
pany states the documents of April 27, 1900,
were 'submitted to General Wood, these docu
ments being approved by General Wood In all
their parts. They Included the erant of a mo
nopoly for ten .' years. .. The claim that the
gambling "r/as an adjunct rather than a part
of the game is "disproved by. the president of
the Jai Alai. General Wood did not furnish
full .information for the . action of the War
Department. Wallis Clearman, with Tiffany
& Co. of New York, testified that an order
was cabled to Tiffany by Mr.- Zarasqueta for
a silver service valued at about $5000 and that
he took such a service to Havana, where it
was- â¢ accepted and paid for. .by Zarasqueta.
That this was ai gift to General Wood from
the Jai Alal CompanxJs admitted.
WOOD'S ORDERS TO COURT.
The sixth count says: ;
j General Brooke testified' to the Insubordi
nation of General Wood and that he (Brooke)
refrained from court-martial process becauso
of. the feeling that such a. step would not -be
sanctioned by the War Department.
The" seventh and last count, in the
brief- refers entirely to testimony re
garding General Wood's veracity. The
testimony of Brigadier General Wil
liam Ludlow, -Commander Lucien
Young. . Major Runcie, Alexander E.
Frls and a number of others is quoted
in support of the count.
The Jai Alai concession forms t^ie
fifth count in the minority's brief, and
the following summing up is made: -
Baker states that ' General Wood was very
frank in -his expressions of criticism of tbe
Brooke administration and that as a general
result of his visit to Cuba he found. that Gen
eral Wood was antagonistic to General Brooke's
administration.
- Ttuncie twearg that arrangements were made
between lilmneif. Ray Stannard Baker and
General Wood for Runcie to write an article
covering; all Cuba, and General. Wood under
stood that the article w,ould be a criticism of
General Brooke's administration. He also
swears that, after It was written. General
Wood asked him if it had been written and
cent to Baker.
General Wood is charged in the third
count with having violated a promise
made to Major James E. Runcie not
to. cause the arrest of Corydon.M. Rich,
who had been an assistant to Neely in
the finance bureau of the Department
of Posts.
The Runcie magazine article is .the
subject of the fourth count. With many
references to the printed"* testimony
for the purpose of supporting the argu
ment, this statement is made:
j The second count in the brief of the
, minority v rplates to the pardon of W.
H. Reeves and his testimony in the
postal cases. In this connection the
attention of the Senate is directed to
i the statement ef General Wood in an
jswer to the charges filed by Major
I Rathbone, General Wood. tells the cir
cumstances u:3der which Reeves sur
rendered money received from Neely
in the Cuban postal frauds and after
ward turned State's evidence in the
trials. General Wood said that, in par
doning Reeves, he believed he had the
right to constitute him a witness for
the state; for. although Reeves had j
been a defendant, "he had confessed
freely and fully concerning the frauds
committed in the Postoffice Depart
ment." It is charged further that Gen
eral Wood failed to inform the court
that he had promised to pardon Reeves,
and 'that in consequence of such fail
ure the court regarded Reeves as a de- r
fendant and' permitted him to testify
without the solemnity of an oath,
THAT RUNCIE ARTICLE.
The minority says that to get around
this order General Wood used his au
thority as Military Governor to change
the entire judicial system of the island.
PARDONING OF RI^EVES.
Secretary Roofs order was promul
gated by Colonel Scott as adjutant gen
eral on November 14, 1901, and trans
mitted to the court on November 15,
1901. In this military order the prose
cution is instructed that if it has any
intention of usins as evidence in the
trial of the postal cases testimony ap
plied for in the United States "steps
should be taken to immediately inform
the proper judicial authorities that this
cannot be allowed."
First submitted in the brief is the
argument that it is not denied that the
orders to the court, which were intro
duced by Major . Hathbone, were act
ually issued by General Wood as Mili
tary Governor. These orders were for
the admission of ex parte testimony,
and in that connection attention has
been called by the minority to an order
issued by the Secretary of War, in
which General Wood's orders are de
clared to have been a perversion of in
structions.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5.â The views
of the minority of the Senate Commit
tee on Military Affairs protesting
against the confirmation of General
Leonard Wood to be major general)
have been prepared In" the form 01 a
brief to be used by the opponents of
his nomination when the reports of the
committee are presented for the action
of the Senate in executive session. The
brief follows the testimony Introduced
before the Senate committee in the In
vestigation, which was begun on No
vember 19 and continued until Decem
ber 17, directing the attention of Sen
ators to passages in the printed report
of the testimony and emphasizing the
charges made before the committee.
It is declared most of the important
subjects brought out in the hearing
came to public knowledge subsequent
to General Wood's promotion to be
brigadier general and that no compe
tent investigation has yet beer, made
in regard to actual facts of General
Wood's .military career and experience.
1 These assertions are made for the
purpose of meeting the argument of
Senator Foraker that obections to Gen
eral Wood's advancement should have
been made when President McKinley
had under consideration his promotion
to be brigadier general.

BEGAL SHOES.
man reader of this newspaper
is a possible customer for Regal
shoes. Probably one-tenth of them
really wear Regals now. If we could
get each man to tell the other nine what He knows
about Regal style, Regal comfort, and Regal wear, we
could not hope to supply the demand.
It is hard to overcome the inertia of long fixed habit.
A man who pays a custom shoemaker $12 or $14 a pair
for shoes can't seem to realize that times have changed.
He was right 20 years ago; he was right, partially, even
10 years ago, but that was before the time of the Regal.
Getting the best leather is only a matter of paying
the priceâ the best leather on earths cannot cost more
than $1.75 for each pair of shoes. We can afford to use
it and we do. We use the same grade* the fancy shoe-
maker does. â¢ In style we are identical^-we ; copy him
and he copies us. We are never far apart. .
Then why do you pay him $14 for what we sell
at $3-50? We would really and. honestly like to
know how you figure it out. Will you call' and
tell us? ?â¢ :';Â¦;Â¦'-'''^ :

this year and includes many prominent
collegians. In addition to those who
have been "flunked" twenty-four stu
dents have been given leave of absence

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 5.â
The figures given out by Registrar El

TACOMA HAS UNIQUE
METHODIST CirCRClI
Edifice Has Equipments for Cooking
and a Gymnasium for Boys
and Girls.
TACOMA, Jan. 5.â Under the lead
ership of Rev. J. W. Miller, its pastor,
the Methodist church of Centralia has
built a unique church edifice, which
will be dedicated next Sunday by
Bishop Hamilton of San Francisco.
Â¦The pastor has arranged that the
building will be dedicated practically
free from debt. Its special features
arc the result of a belief of Pastor
Miller that churches can be made to
serve their members in many ways
between Sabbaths. One special oo
ject sought to be obtained is to Vro
vide comforts for farmers and their
wives when in town shopping. Cen
tralia is the shipping center for a
large stretch of tributary country,
which explains the desirability of this
feature. The basement of the edifice
contains a resting room for the use
of farmers, with a fully equipped
kitchen adjoining, where they can
warm lunches brought from home or
cook meals. Bathrooms are provided
on the same floor, with separate read
ing and reception rooms and a gym
nasium for boys and girls. This part
of the church will be kept open every
day, committees of ladies alternating
in welcoming and taking care of
friends and visitors.
Explosion Hurls Four Men to Death.
PENZAXCE! England. Jan. 5.â
Four men were killed and several were
injured by an explosion to-day at the
nitro-glyccrln department of the Na
tional Explosive. Works, eight miles
from here. The whole district was
enveloped in a cloud of black smoke
and nearly every window at St. Ives,
three miles from the scene of the.ex
plosion, was shattered by the terrific
force. Many windows were also
smashed at Penzance.
Lawyer Bodwell cross-examined the
witness rigidly and more than once
the witness appealed to Judge Duke
to protect him from what he consid
ered insulting questions and Infer
ences. The court cautioned the law
yer to be more courteous.
Mrs. Dunsmuir had come to witness*
offices at San Francisco to ask advice
regarding settlement with James
Dunsmuir. Witness had Wvised her
to accept James Dunsmuir's proposi
tion. She was not in fit physical con
dition to enter a contest. She seemed
well pleased with the terms of the
agreement, which was signed. Mrs.
Dunsmuir was in normal mental con
dition then and to her death. Wit
ness had seen her an hour before she
died.
Dr. Thome' told of conversations
with Alexander Dunsmuir. in which
Dunsmuir had stated that on Mrs
Dunsmuir's death he wished the prop
erty to go to James Dunsmuir's chil
dren, as he did not want Edna, re
ferring to Mrs. Hopper, to have a dol
lar of his money.
In the cross-examination by coun
sel for plaintiff Dr. Thorne of San
Francisco said he had never noticed
any mumbling by Alexander Duns
muir. except when intoxicated. Wit
ness did not consider that Dunsmuir
had alcoholic dementia nor meningi
tis. I ,
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 5.~Dr. Walter
Thome of San Francisco. Alexander
Durismulr's physician Tor years. .gave
evidence to-day In the suit brought by
Edna Wallace ,- Hopper to break the
dead millionaire's trill. He had first
attended Dunsmuir when the d*>ad mil
lionaire was suffering from the effects
of a debauch. Dr. Thorne testified to
an operation in 183" and said Dunsmuir
did not drink anything for several
months then, but the majority of oc
casions when witness attended were for
Illness from drinking.
Mrs. Wallace desired the witness to
attend oftener than he did to keep
Dunsmuir. in check. He had accom
panied Dunsmuir to British Columbia
as physician on the fishing tr!p and Dr.
Thorne told of conversations with Mrs.
Wallace, then Mrs. Dunsmuir, regard-
Ing the San Leandro property, of how
Dunsmuir wanted to give It to her with
a string on It and she would not have
it that way.
The principal reason, for Harrlman'a
action In obtaining the Chinese com
pany's ships Is the promise of the Port
land flouring mills to doubla their ca
pacity if a larger steamship line were
established. The differential created by
the rate war in favor of San Francisco
was very bad for the Oregon and Wash
ington millers, and the amalgamation
of the disturbing line and the Portland
line will again place all Pacific Coast
ports on even terms in the trade. Ori
ental exporters here who have suffered
from the lack of shipping facilities in
the past are much gratified at the an
nouncement.
This schedule will not permit the
China Commercial Company tn call at
San Francisco. The announcement was
made to-day by A. L. Mohler. president
of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company, who has just returned from
the East. It is in effect thy carrying
out of the promise made by Harriman
on his recent visit here. The Increased
service goes Into effect next month.
In securing this bis addition to their
fleet the Portland and Asiatic Steam
ship Company have settled thtÂ» rate war

The, principal ground on which the
new trial was, granted was the alleged
error in allowing Knapp's written con
fession of five murders to be read to
the jury, i The court said:
"The confession of so many cold
blooded crimes could be the work of
only a fiend or a maniac and It could
not fail to prejudice any person who
heard it read."
The court held that the State had
failed to prove the allegation in the in
dictment that Knapp had killed his
wife by choking and strangling apd
that it had not been shown how she
came by her- death.

Dr. Stahle hired a room in the Bruns
wick House on Sixth street on Monday
afternoon at 4:30 o'clock. He was not
seen again .until his body was found
yesterday morning at 8:30 o'clock by
the porter of the hotel.
The porter discovered the odor of gas
and traced it to the room occupied by
Dr. Stahle. The porter broke in ,the
door and found the occupant lying dead
on the floor dressed In his underclothes.
Beside the corpse were a few sheets of
common wrapping paper, upon which
the suicide told of his experiences as he
passed from consciousness to the ever
lasting sleep of death.
HIS I'RIENDS NOT SURPRISED.
That Dr. Stahle ended his life was no
surprise to a few of his intimate
friends. He had threatened to end his
existence during the last two months
and before his death Stahle wrote let
ters telling his friends of his intention
to seek the mysterious beyond.
The letters written by Dr. Stahle
after he had turned on the illuminating
gas and awaited death were as fol
lows:
"Plain Suicide. Excuse me for the
presumption and Inconvenience caused
you. Please ask Dr. Bacigalupi for me
to telephone to my brother, Charlea,
California Street R. R. Co. '
"The gas has been escaping over an
hour and I cannot find any difference
except a fullness in the head; pulsation
one hour after no material difference,
only about 85.
"They must have improved the qual
ity of the gas. Can't see to write. I
must be tough or the gas is Improved.
3 o'clock."
Before hiring the room in the lodg
ing-house Dr. Stahle wrote two let
ters announcing his Intention to seek
death. One letter was sent to George
Bowman, a saloon-keeper, 231 Larkin
street, with -whom the deceased was*
well acquainted. Â» '
WRITES OF HIS INTENTION.
In the letter received by Bowman
yesterday morning Dr. Stahle wrote
that he was tired of life and that he
had been compelled to borrow money
which he could not repay. He, declared
that his wife was not to blame in .any
way and that he regretted bringing
any trouble upon her. He asked for
giveness from his -relatives and his
friends.
A second letter was written by Dr.
Stahle before his death, "addressed to'
his wife in care of Bowman. Mrs.
Stahle was . too shocked yesterday ' to ;
read the letter, when Bowmair present
ed it to her after she had learned of
her husband's suicide.. â¢â¢'

the Three Unfortunate Men
From reports received from Crrrvallia
it is said thr.t O. V. Hurt, the girl's
father, threatens vengeance on Oref
fi"!d. and it would not be a surprise if
the latter suffered bodily harm when
he meets his irate father-in-law. The
bride is a young lady of good appear
ance, well educated and accomplished.
Breaks disappeared and it is not
known where he went to, but Orefneld
came to Albany this morning. He was
accompanied by Miss Maude Hurt, a
young lady of about 20 years of age.
The two applied for a marriage license
and were married by Judge Palmer.
They returned to their temple and an
nounced their intention of remaining in
t! e county.
Last night Creffleld and Brook? went
over from their rud& temple to Cor
vallis. and about midnight the expected
happened. A score of masked men vis
ited their temporary abode and car
ried the two apostles to an old saw
mill a short distance from town, where
a liberal coat of warm tar and an
ebundance of feathers were applied over
the entire surface of their bodies. They
were then turned loose and the two
spent the rest of the night in relieving
themselves of the covering.
The memberphip increased, and last
October the family of O. V. Hurt joined
the ranks. Hurt was^chief clerk in a
large merchandise store and has occu
pied a prominent position in Bentnn
County and State politics. He is at
present Republican County chairman
*nd State committeeman and himself
end family bore excellent reputations.
The Hurt residence became the head
quarters of the. aggregation and Hurt
resigned his position and entered into
the continuous serio-comic perform
ances x>f the worshioors?.
.Finally Hurt went back to work in
the store and the apostles took up their
residence in a little hut just across
the Willamette River. from Corvallis, on
the Linn County side. Here they con
tinued to hold meetings and several
women frequented the resort. Cref
field and Brooks were unmarried, but
they did not lack for reminine atten
tion or become lonesome on account of
their state of celibacy. Linn County
people threatened to use drastic meas
ures in order to put an end to the
doings r.f the crowd, and Corvallis citi
zens likewise determined to call a halt
If they ever caught them in their midst
again.
CrefP.eld and Brooks first made their
appearance in Corvallis about nine
months ago as members of the Salva
tion Army, but after a few weeks in
the barracks they claimed to have re
ceived a divine message to form a new
organization. The new sect was termed
the "Holy Rollers" on account of the
peculiar antics of members who cried,
laughed, prayed and sang while rolling
end throwing their bodies over the floor
and ground.

PILES.
Cnmd Quickly and Without Pain.
There are pile remedies without
rumber. but there is only one cure,
rnd that is the Pyramid Pile Cure,
Â¦uhich is in the form of a suppository \
end is applied directly to*.the seat of
the trouble.
Any physician will tell you that for
the proper treatment of Piles nothing
can compare with a suppository,
whereas the greater number of prep-
arations that are % offered to you for j
the treatment of this disease are lo- j
tions, salves and ointments. Why?
Because they are not so -expensive as
a suppository, which is bound to. con-
tain more costly Ingredients and
which requires special machinery
to make it; moreover, a suppository
inserted up the rectum comes in direct
.contact with the cause of the com-
plaint, and no otjier form of treat-
ment does so.
Wallace Cookman. Hallerton, P. Q.,
Canada, writes: "I have had two sur-
gical operations for piles and they
â¢were not a success: artcr using three
boxes of Pyramid Pile Cure I feel as
, though I never had piles, and they
have afflicted me for twenty-five
years."
B. H. Palmer, Windsor. Cal.: "After
pufferirg from piles for fifteen years
and trying different salves and oint-
ments in vain I was completely cured
by the use of two fifty-cent packages
of Pyramid Pile Cure."
These and thousands of similar let-
ters go to 'show that piles ' can be
cured, are cured. Cured to stay cured.
Cured so they won't come back. Cured

ger. Cured without pain. Cured with-

RIVERSIDE, Jan. 5.â Superior Judge
Xoyes in a supplemental charge to the
Grand Jury to-day instructed that
body to make rigid inquiry in the mat
ter of the sale of Riverside County
courthouse bonds, and made grave ac
cusations against the State Board of
Examiners, charging that State and
county alike had suffered a loss of
513,000 in the sale of the btmds. Fol
lowing are the words of the Judge in
hi3 instructions to the Grand Jury:
"The fact of the case, gentlemen, 13
this: The State Board of Examiners
must have known of this swindle, be
cause the agent aforesaid could not
have operated as he did in making the
bid for bonds without assurance on the
part of the State Board of Examiners
that they would take them. And. as
they allowed this agent to operate with
the money of the State directly, al
though In the name of a Chicago firm,
has not the State. of California prac
tically hid the full sum of $169,000, in
stead of $156,000, all of which should
go, in justice and good conscience, to
the countv of Riverside?
"If this be so. Riverside County
should have to-day in its* treasury the
full sum of $169,000 instead of the lesser
amount. It is apparent that the State
Board of Examiners knew of these pro
c tedings leading up to the bid of
$155,000. It is apparent that the State
Board of Examiners knew that funds
over which it had plenary control were
being used directly to consummate th.s
deal. This board knew that it was
paying $13,000 in excess of the bid. and
yet it pays this unconscionable differ
ence for bonds when it could, by its
agent, secretary or through a local
bank, have bid successfully at an ex
pense not to exceed $25 or $50 at the
most. *
"From these facts a double injustice
appears lo have been perpetrated. The
State has been swindled out of $13,000
through the act of its Board of Ex
aminers in paying this $13,000 more
than the bid. or the county has been
swindled by losing this $13,000 the State
was willing and did pay for the bonds,
but which Riverside County never got."
The court further asked that Daniel
Kevane. H. A. Kirkwood, agent of the
Trowbridge-Xiver Company of Chica
go; F. M." Dunbar, chairman j of the
Board of Supervisors; W. V. Clancy,
County Auditor; William Douglass and
the cashier of D. O. Mills & Co., bank
ers, through whom the alleged corrupt
deal was consummated, be subpenaed
and required to tell what they know.

DOWIE TALKS

JUDGE ACCUSES
A STATE BOARD
Appeals -to Citizens to Uphold. High
Chic Standards of Community
in Which They Live.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger delivered a
forclble talk to the members of the
Young Men's Christian Association
laat eve'ning on "Good Citizenship."
He gave an. exposition of his views on
what tended to make a good citizen.
He contended that one man owed a
responsibility to another, and it was
his duty to be conversant with the
laws of his country and to obey them
to the letter.
He declared that the - association
was doing its duty to the State and
nation by holding night schools,
wherein men who are anxious to
study so that they may be able to
discuss and appreciate political eco
nomy may be directed by able teach
ers. He. appealed to the assemblage
to do its share in the preservation
and maintenance of the highest pos
sible civic standards in the commun
ity. He said it was the- duty of all to
live moral Iive3 and uphold moral
laws. He- did not believe in idleness
and gave it as his opinion that even
scholars should be taught a trade in
order to better fit themselves for the
world's work. .
"Civilization stands for far more
than a condition," he said. "Civiliza
tion irl reality is an expression of the
rejationship that exists between mem
bers of a community. It is the ex
pression of a conscious relationship;
it is the expression of an intelligent
relationship between members of a
community. We are all responsible to
one another. A community means an
aggregation of units that are respon
sible to each other.
"Ignorance in our age almost be
gets a crime. It certainly is a mis
fortune, but it is almost a crime. Why
a crime'' Because the opportunities
for knowledge are so ample that there
is not one human being in the coun
try that need withdraw from it. Why
a misfortune? Because in this out
reaching age it Is the man of knowl
edge that will always win out against
the man of ignorance."

Journalism in China.
In Germany the position of a news
panÂ«r editor is a precarious one, says
the Indianapolis Journal. He must be
very careful not to criticise the Em
peror, or otherwise to incur the wrath
of the press censor, or he will be thrown
into jail and his paper will be sus
pended. But in China It is even worse.
The offending "editor who expresses
opinions contrary to -those of the ad
ministration is liable to the extreaae
penaltyâ death In no merciful guise.
Several months ago a pn*acher of
reform in Peking was beaten to death
with bamboo rods?. Later the editors
of the publication called Supao were
charged with sedition. Their sedition
consisted in advocating more modern
methods in the administration of the
Government. This brought down upon
them the anger of the Dowager Em
press, who ordered their instant ap
prehension. It appears, however, that
the editors had realired the enormity
of their offense, for they sought refuge
In the foreign reservation, n-here they
came under the protection of the con
sulates.
The Question whether the daring
newspaper men should be surrendered
to the native authorities Vas referred
to the legations. It was certain that
if this should be done cruel acd bar

or other, United States Minister Con

a person has written an article and

THE Los Angeles orange growers have arrived at
the conclusion that the best move they" can make is
to give to the thousands of tourists who annually
come from the East to California the best fruit that
grows in the orchards of the* State. Climate is the chief
asset of this State. ? In point^f attractiveness the prod
ucts of orchard, vineyard and field ire next. They show
the value of climate; effectively. But if the visitor has but
the poorer qualities" of fruit presented to him in the mar
kets he is apt to think that between promise and per
formance there is a Vide margin.
The Los Angeles Herald says:. "A thorough investiga
tion of this subject by the officers of the California Fruit
Agency has revealed a condition that demands a radical
change in supplying this market. Nearly the entire con
sumption of citrus fruit in the city has heretofore been
supplied by a ciass of peddlers who have made a prac
tice of driving to the various packing houses throughout
Southern California and purchasing for a mere nominal
sum fruit that woald otherwise be destroyed by the pack
ers. - * * * This is the fruit that lias largely been sup
plied to Los Angeles consumers, and it is also a sample
of our great product that we offer to the Eastern. tourist,
and' he 'certainly under such circumstances cannot be
blamed if he, returns home and , says^ that California
oranges are not fit to cat The plan of , the California
Fruit. Agency- contemplates the of this condition
to the extent of making it impossible for such worthless
supplies to reach our local market." .
Some controversy has arisen by reason of this move,
but it is so evidently desirable that good fruit be offered
in the local market if the reputation of the State is to bf
maintained that there is no, doubt the plan will succeed
in larjre, measure. Of course there is a trade that re
quires the lowest priced fruit that is wholesome at all, but
the best is indispensable to properly supply a great part
of the comrnanitj'. Visitors from the East should be of
fered no other grade, . - â

"Coon" songrs and "rag time" have their
place. I do not deny that â but their
place is not In the practice hour. I
cannot rpoak too strongly about this,
for If the pupil be allowed to fritter
away his mind on those things during
the time that he should be devoting it
to tho best that lies within his exasp

Keep his mind clear and frre from
these things as much as possible, and
tf he muft have "coon songs" let it be
outside the practice hour, anrl after his
regular piano study is over for the day.
When the boy has become a good
pianist he will have no trouble In play-
Ing "coon" songsâ they will need no
practice, and, his musical xnlnd once
formed, no amount of "rag time" that
he may Indulge In will unbalance It,
but turn the matter the other way

THE agricultural capacities of this country arc so
vast and so adapted to an immense variety oi
products that the most useful service lies in finding
the products, increasing their number, and thereby pro
viding a greater variety of crops, providing a larger ro
tation and increasing profits. Secretary Wilson has
made the Department of Agriculture a most important
means in rendering this kind of service. He has intro
duced macaroni wheat, the grain of which the Italian
pastas arc made, which was never before raised in this
country. The commercial value of macaroni^ imported is
very large, and the new wheat not only adds a new crop
but promises to domesticate a new manufacture.
This wheat should be of interest to the grain raisers
of California, since it has proved successful in the arid
parts ot Colorado and the Dakotas when raised by "dry
farming." When we have a dry season here, irrigation
takes care of everything but our small grain, which suf
fers most of all. Irriga'tion is not applied to grain, be
cause where water is available it is more profitable ap
plied to fruit and alfalfa. We believe that there is very
little irrigated wheat grown here. One reason" is the
large scale on which we grow wheat. In France, where
wheat is hand drilled and'is cultivated in rows as we
cultivate corn, irrigation is applied to the crop. But
here, where we grow wheat in fields of fifty thousand
acres, the rainfall is depended on to make a crop.
Of the Darum or macaroni wheats there are ten va
rieties. East ol the Rocky Mountains it is found that
they succeed only, when sown, as -spring wheat. But in
that they share the lot of our common wheats. Deep
freezing and uncertainty of snowfall make~\vinter wheat
in that region an uncertain cropi and the reliance of the
farmer and miller is upon spring sown grain. But these
macaroni wheats are specially adapted to regions of
heat and drought. They need a soil rich in potash and
alkali. The straw is long, the leaf broad and smooth,
and itk construction shows resistance to evaporation
which is its strength in resisting drought. Thj leaves
have a thick cuticle. The heads-are short apd very thick
and with the longest beard worn by any wheat.
In Colorado it yielded seventy bushels to the acre, in
a dry soil that produced only twenty-five bushels of or
dinary tffceat. The grain is not exclusively fitted for
macaroni, for the bread it makes is preferred to , any
other by those who have used it. At first millers re
fused to grist it, bnt now four mills in the flour centers
arc running on it almost exclusively, and as the crop in
creases others will of necessity have to receive it.
When it is known that Italy makes immense imports
of this gram from Russia and Hungary, its value as an
export crop appears. Our trade with Italy, is rapidly in
creasing, and the balance has lately turned against us,
which ratans that we arc buying more of that country
than we sell to her. tf we can export this wheat or its
flour, we may be able to balance that trade.
It is of sach interest to California wheat growers that
they should try this new crop. If it produce seventy-five
bushels per acre in Colorado against twenty-five, of ordi
nary wheat on the sameland, it will fioarish here ex-
A NEW WHEAT.

The following comments from our
contemporaries upon the policy of
State exploitation which The Call has
adopted show that its efforts have not
been In vain.
The Modesto Morning Herald has
this to say:
, "The San Francisco Call's regular
Monday 'development' page this-week
includes dairy, creamery and alfalfa
illustrations, a valuable article by
Manager Arthur R. Briggs of the
State Board of Trade on the dairy in
dustry, an article by Alexander Craw
on the destruction of fruit pests
through the medium of friendly in
sects, a five-inch article on the
'Growth of Stanislaus," recounting the
annual election of our Board of Trade
and quoting an extract from the re
port of the retiring president, and a
short column of miscellaneous notes.
This new feature of The Call is much
appreciated in the interior and can
not fail to redound to the material ad
vantage of the State."*
The following from the Lakeport
Bee:
"The Call is running some rattling
good articles on the resources an.il at
tractions of the State, besides report
ing all the new enterprises and im
provements. It3 work is good."
Of The Call's work the Sutler Creek
Record has this to say:
"The San Francisco Call has recent
ly been publishing some excellent ar
ticles on the resources and attractions
of the State. This is at the instiga
tion of the California Promotion Com
mittee and will surely result in great
good. All the new enterprises and
improvements everywhere are re
ported."
Szi'cct Charity.
A multimillionaire of San Francisco
announced his wish last August of be
coming a member of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He
was formally elected and paid the an
nual dues of $6. The day after he was
given a card of membership he visited
the offices of the society in the Parrott
building and asked if he might be al
lowed to examine the accounts. He
was informed that the secretary was
willing to permit any one to examine
the books. The new member hesitated
a few seconds and then asseverated
that he would call another day to see
that the finances were all right.
The next heard from him was early
in December. He called up Secretary
Holbrook by telephone and said: "I
joined vour society four months ago
end paid the annual dues amounting
to $6. I have made up my mind to go
to Europe and will bo gone indefinitely.
A3 I will not be able to enjoy the ben
efits of membership while I' am gone
and cannot help shape the policy of the
society, I would like %i for the unex
pired two-thirds of the year for which
I paid in advance." The secretary re
plied that the matter would have to be
brought to the attention of the society's
board of trustees in the fcrm of a writ-,
ten communication. The capitalist de
parted before the next meeting of the
board, but left a letter requesting the
return of the $4 and giving an address
in New York to which the money
shouU be sent. The trustees had a
hearty laugh over the matter and voted
to accept the rich man's resignation
to take effect at the end of the time for
which he had paid- The $4 will be used
in the charitable work of the society.
BY reason at the prominence given to Olney at the
Democratic banquet in New York on Monday
evening, the Massachusetts statesman holds for a
time the center of the stage as a Presidential candidate
of his party, and as his own State has formally decided
to urge his nomination, he may- be looked upon as an
active aspirant for the honor. The time for holding
State conventions to elect delegates to the national con
vention is now so near at hand it is hardly likely any
other Democratic candidate can manage to crowd Olney
into the background before the convention mce % ts. He
holds therefore a conspicuous place in the arena of na
tional politics, and is already within measurable dis
tance of the nomination.
Under such circumstances it is inevitable that close
attention will be given to his utterances from this time
on, and also to every indication of support for him or of
antagonism to him on the part of representatives of the
various factions in the party. Such indications have al
ready become noticeable. On the one hand Williams of
Mississippi, leader of the Democrats of the House of
Representatives, was conspicuous among those who
first formally presented Olney as a candidate for the
nomination, while on the other hand the big banquet in
New York has almost been completely ignored by
papers supporting the nomination of Hearst.
It is, of course, impossible to forecast "Nic action gf a
party led by leaders so erratic as those who for eight
years have been in control of the Democratic organiza
tion, but it is undeniable that at present it looks very
much as if the Massachusetts man would win out in the
convention. It seems that\ll New England is with him
and that New York prefers him to any other candidate
in sighl. The Bryanitc wing of. the party, under the
leadership of Tom Johnson, was so utterly crushed in
the late election in Ohio that it is hardly likely it can
hold the South away from an Eastern alliance. Thus
Olney is likely to get almost all the Southern, as well as
the Eastern vote. That will leave the opposition so
weakened that being without a leader of any prestige or
capacity in politics it will hardly be possible for them
to defeat Olncy even though it will require only one
third of the votes in convention to do so.
The speech delivered by the rising candidate of con
servative Democracy shows that he intends to make the
race on lines essentially similar to those taken by Cleve
land, and that if he be nominated the campaign will be
made on a platform demanding a revision of the tariff,
and denouncing: the present administration in the good
old Rourbon style. Tariff revision will be in short
about the only affirmative policy advocated, and perhaps
that will not be advocated very strongly. So conserva
tive a course in opposition would not be effective under
ordinary conditions, but the country has become so dis
gusted with the aggressive vagaries and radicalism of
Bryanitc Democracy that the course taken by the con
servatives may prove formidable. Olncy's -candidacy
therefore is one that Republicans, cannot afford to watch
with carelessness, for should he be selected to* lead a
reorganized Democracy, even so successful a President
a Roosevelt would not have a walkover despite his per
sonal popularity and the indisputable merit of his admin
istration.

The trial has not yet taken place.
On nothing more than an accusation
the men have been kept in prison, all

the Government announces that a spe
cial deputy will be appointed to hear
the case, and that this deputy will be
instructed not to be lenient should the

the penalty has already been decided

The restaurant keeper of Chicago whose splendid
service qf mercy and humanity to the victims of the fire
shines like an enduring gloom of good in an abyss of
evil is suffering from loss of patronage because of the
repugnance of his customers to a place that has been a
charnel-house. It seems almost incredible that Ameri
cans should so conduct themselves. This restaurant
keeper, so pre-eminently a herb and a lover ofhis kind,
should ever be held as one for whom no reward" can be
adequate. Â» ,
HOW one calamity may produce another was near
being shown in a New York theater on Saturday
night. The whjole country had that day read of
the effect of executing the remarkable order of Mayor
Harrison that ail the bells in Chicago be tolled for an
hour, The dramatic gloom of this harrowing proceed
ing had been increased by a saddening snowstorm while
it was going on. Without discussing the propriety of
such an order on an occasion when the whole commu
nity was at the highest tension and several thousand
people were mourning their dead and no one needed
any reminder of the appalling horror, it is obvious that
people in every city in the country were impressed to a
highly nervous state.
Some one, in an immense theater audience in New
York, perhaps in sheer hysteria induced by thinking of
the Chicago tragedy, the thought being more persistent
and vivid by the thinker being in a theater, cried fire.
The audience rose aJid rushed to the exits in a panic.
Ample police force was present and the officers beat the
first ones back and kept them on their feet and finally
succeeded in checking the mad stampede. Then it
turned out that there was no fire except in the hysteri
cal imagination of the person who raised the cry.
People feel very cautious about getting into crowds
now, and the public authorities of every city should im
prove the opportunity to restore confidence in the only
way possible, which is by compelling every theater and
other building in which crowds meet to "be made safe
by making it fire proof. It is doubtful whether it will
ever be safe to stop short of actual fire-proofing all such
buildings, by compelling the use of metal, masonry and
terra cotta and fire-proofed scenery.
The makeshift of an asbestos drop is proved insuffir
cicnt. The asbestos curtain in the Chicago theater did
not drop, but if it had the calamity would not have been
averted, for the curtain itself was found shredded by the
fire. By the entire exclusion of wood and inflammable
fabrics only can a theater bo made absolutely safe.
Metal and masonry and terra cotta covered with paint
can do no harm, while pine may be fired by the paint
upon it.
Hut panics may occur fram other causes than fire.
We had some bomb throwing in a San Francisco thea
ter. Insanity or criminal purpose may at any moment
alarm a dense crowd and start a rush to escape. It is
surely within the capacity of architects and builders to
plan exits that cannot be choked under such circum
stances. In the Chicago theater I he door by which the
actors left the building opened inwardly, and they were,
all jammed against it, and would have been roasted like
rats in a^straw stack, if the cool-headed man outside
who heard the sounds of tragedy had not known how
to unhang the door and let them out. Exits should be
planned so that doors open outwardly and their fasten
ing should be such that it releases them with but slight
pressure from within.
Horrible as the Chicago lire is it may save thousands
of lives in the future, if it do not pass out of public
memory before the authorities of every city sec to it
that audience rooms arc' not death traps for those who
resort to them. â¢ < ,- - â¢
He Refused Adoption.
She Is a woman about 50 years of
age, tall and slender, with an at

She had been hovering about the
corridors of the City Hall for the
past year, without even once speak

One day last week, however, she spied
a. Janitor named Geegan who was in
dustriously sweeping the concrete
flags. Now Geegan Is by no means a
handsome man; nature was stingy
with him In regard to the distribution
of beauty. But to the silent woman
this dr- vback had no effect.
She approached him and made him
an offer of her, bank book on the HI
bernla Bank which contained $3000.
with the additional offer of adopting
him. She was Infatuated with him be
cause he resembled a lover she had
when she was young, but who had been
killed in a railroad accident in Nevada
twenty years ago. She even saw in
Geegan the real flesh blood rein
carnation of that dead lover. The wo
man's offer was declined an p police

ccmrse, thought out the bent, way to
produce some certain effect that he
had In mind at the time he originated
the composition, and the closer the pu
pil gets to the Idea of the composer the
more muslclanly does his rendition of
a piece become.
The S'rft pedal Is a more simple mat
ter, the principal trquble with regard
tÂ«j It being that people are apV to use
It too much. This is unconscious lazi
ness, for It Is far easier, at first, to put
the foot down firmly on the soft pedal
when trying to play a passage softly
and throw off all responsibility, leav
ing the foot comfortably planted on the
long suffering pedal, until a point In
the music Is reached where an Increase
In volume of sound is desired. This In
all wrong, for such a proceeding can
bring forth but one result, and that Is
piano playing as mechanical as the
music produced by a street piano. All
the light and shade should come from
the musician's twtich. from the soul
back of the flnEcrs, never from the
contrasting effect of the "loud and soft
pedal." This Is almost the only point
which mechanical science has been un
able to grapple withâ as yet no one
has been'nhle to make an automatic
piano that can reproduce real emotion.
The mechanical contrivances seem per
fect In all but erne tningâ If a single
note Is played softly all the others must

a piano attachment that can make the
music "Fing." Only the fingers can
do that, nnd unless they do It Inde
pendently of both pedals they gain no
advantage over the mechanical adjust
ments now so frequently In use.
Do- not imagine for a moment that
I do not believe In using the pedals. I
do most decidedly, but as an adjunct
where an added effect Is desired and
never to tide over n rough passage.
Now we will turn our attention for u

Alti: NOT UP TO STANDARD
The news of Mme. Paget's death was
received with profound regret by many
Mme. Paget's death came as if in an
swer to the oft-expressed wish that she
might not long survive her husband.
She passed away late at night in the
rose-eovered cottage she had known so
long on Dwight way. Hers was a
peaceful death, befitting the life of
good doing and philanthropy that she
had led. She had not been permitted
to attend the funeral of the beloved
husband after his death two weeks ago,
being herself too ill and wearied from
the long period of nursing that she had
passed through for his sake. She kept
her bed and saw her life's partner
borne away to everlasting rest and
mourned -him. Then she prayed that
she might die, too. The bereavement
aggravated the malady that had come
upon her and every day saw the light
of her life growing a little dimmer.
She retained the vigor of her mind to
the last, however, and passed away In
the presence of friends, to whom she
confided that she was going to rejoin
her husband.
of deserving students in the French
department.
To Rev. Joseph Worcester of San
Francisco. is given an oil painting of
Professor Paget, $500 In cash and her
diamond ring; to Lucille Ware Leete,
$300 in cash, and to Rev. Mr. Worcester
mementoes for distribution among
friends. The residue of tho estate is
sriven to Louis de F. Bartlett In trust,
with directions to pay the income to
the three sisters of Professor Paget In
France. One-third of the principal is
to be applied to the scholarehip fund
and the remainder to the payment of
the debt of the family in France.
DEATH IS PEACEFUL.
MADAME E. M. PAGET WHO
PASSED AWAY IN BERKg-
LEY OX MONDAY.
Mme. Paget was .very much interest
ed in,,the students of the university and
assisted many of them over the rough
path to graduation and success. She
was instrumental in getting for them
assistance to go abroad and for other
things. A few years ago she attempted
to secure a fund for a students' hos
pital and collected some $1800, but the
project did not carry, j
She was a native of Paris, 69 years
old. She was educated at the Saust
Circe, the famous girls' school of Paris,
and was graduated from it shortly be
fore she became of age. Â¦
was Mme. Paget that first suggest
ed the Town and Gown Club, that in
stitution that now. after eight years,
exerts such an influence in the civic
affairs of Berkeley. She was the first
president of the club and at her death
was its treasurer. She was assisted in
this undertaking by such women as
Mrs. A. J. Ralston, Mrs. Warren Wil
kinson, Mrs. Frank Wilson Mrs.
George W. Haight, Mrs. Freeman, Mrs.
P. R. Boonc and others.
FOUNDED A CLUB.
members of the University of Califor
nia and people of the town, all "of whom
had a share in her friendship. With
her husband she had been for years ac
tive In Town and Gown Club affairs.
She was first in almost everything that
made for Material progress within and
without the Intellectual center of the
State: she had a keen mind, originality
and withal a generous spirit that en
deared her to hundreds.
When she came to Berkeley with her
husband Mme. Paget at once became
identified with the ; social life of the
town, being the leader in many func
tions.
DES MOINES, Iowa, Jan. 5. â C. L.
Linley, supervising: architect, fell six
ty feet to his death to-day at the State
Capitol. While Linley was making an
inspection of the locality where 'yes
terday's fire .originated the floor gave
way, precipitating him to the floor
of the chamber of Representatives.
His skull was crushed.
FalLs Sixty Feet to His Death.
But the explanation for this meager
estate comes now in the last writing
of Mme. Paget. All these years of
struggle Jhey said nothing of their
work to their friends and only through
death is the secret of their lives re
vealed.
Mme. Paget had a large sympathy
for the university and even on her
deathbed, 'as revealed by the will, her
thoughts were for it and the students.
It was dictated and signed by her on
December iT, four days after her hus
band's death, when she knavv that she
had not long to live. In the final sen
tence of the document she gives an In
dication of her strength of character
and at the same time a weaknessâ a
fear that she might have been con
sidered mentally weak by requesting
Dr. George H. Reinhardt to testify that
she was competent at the time she
signed it.
Under the terms of the will she be
queaths to the university her husband's
library arid one-third of her estate,
which, excluding their late heme, is
probably worth $12,000, for the found-
Ing of what will be known as the F.V.
Paget scholarship fund for the benefit
EXPLANATION* IN WILIi.
Professor Paget was called to the
chair of Romanic languages at the Uni
versity of California in 1S87 and the
little family of two came to Berkeley,
which has since been their home. He
taught for sixteen years and only re
tired a year ago when his health failed
him.
When Professor Paget died two weeks
ago his will was filed, but according to
its terms but a modest sum was left
to distribute. People said that he had
given his estate to his wife before his
death, as it was not probable he had
left so little. He had earned for a
long time at the university a salary of
$3000 a year and must have saved
something.
"The remainder of my estate I wish
to be applied to the payment of the
debts of the family in France, due. to
the Franco-Prussian war, which Pro
fessor Paget voluntarily assumed," is
the simple language, of the will. It
tells the whole story of privation and
self-forgetfulness and relinquishment
of all worldly affairs with a modest es
tate after years of work. It tells th^
story of how Felicien Paget, coming
home a soldier after the war only to
find the estate in ruins. French and
Prussian armies had tramped over the
land again and again during that brief
struggle in 1S70 and ruined it almost
beyond repair.
It needed n>oney then to restore the
estate and this young Paget was re
quired to borrow. He had three sisters
to support and they have lived all these
years on the estate while he struggled
to pay off the debts? of war.
The soldier married Mile. Emanuel
Marie Jacquet in Paris after the great
struggle was over. She was the daugh
ter of an old Norman family of an
cient ancestry and reared in luxury,
but s'he gladly took up' the burdens of
her husband and helped carry them un
til the very last breath.
The Pagcts came to America four
years after their marriage, which took
place in 1871, called by the hopes of
fortune in the new land. Th^y settled
in San Francisco after an interval yf
travel and began teaching French and
Spanish languages. Mrae. Paget was
an accomplished musician and in the
endeavor of her husband to pay off the
debt hovering over him taught music
also. They were successful from the
first and taught Californians in those
early days who have since become fa
mous.
BERKELEY, Jan. 5. â Madame
Emanuel Marie Paget died to-day at
her home, 2727 Dwight way, just thir
teen days after the death of her hus
band, the late Professor Felicien Victor
Paget, and a few hours afterward there
was filed for probate a will that re
vealed at once the story of two lives
that had been devoted to almost a
single objectâ devoted to the payment
of a self-imposed debt that even thlrty
'years of toil had not erased. It was a
debt that Professor Paget undertook to
bear alone, but in the liquidation of
which his devoted wife also partici
pated with the strength of will and for
titude that was part of her .character.
Even all their savins and self-denial
for a third of a century did not blot
out the obligation, and with a heroism
almost divine Madams Paget sat up in
her deathbed and signed the paper that
will make obligatory the dispensation
of a portion of her estate for the satis
faction of her .husband's debtors'
claims.
An act of heroism is. but temporary,
while an act of charity is everlasting.
HOPLAXD, Jan.. 6\ â The Poma
Indians, who occupy a rancheria here
on land owned by President Poster of
the California and Northwestern
Railway, must seek a new home. For
many years the Indians have lived
here and worked on the Foster and
neighboring ranches. They have
been the recipients of many favors at
the hands of Mr.- Foster, but their
stock has been allowed to overrun his
ranges and break down" his . fences.
Yesterday he visited Chief Tack and
gave him notice that the tribe must
vacate by spring. . %

was struck a hard blow on the leg
above the knee. Every attention was

puration set in and he was brought
home to the Presidio on the Sherman

looked into the case they decided that
only one chance for his life existed and
that was to take off his leg. Up to the
time of the accident the doctor was in
the best of health and blest with all
the vigor that pertains to a well man at
the age of 30.

KNOWS NOW.
Doctor Was Fooled by His Own Case
for a Time.
It's easy to understand how ordi-
nary people get fooled by coffee, when
doctor* themselves sometimes forget
the facts.
A physician speaks of his own ex-
perience:
"I had used coffee for years and
really did not exactly believe it was
injuring me, although I had palpita-
tion of the heart every day.
"Finally one day a severe and al-
most fatal attack of heart trouble
frightened me and I pave up both tea
md coffee, using Postum instead, and
jince that time I have had absolutely
3o heart palpitation except on one or
two occasions when I tried a small
juantity of coffee, which caused se-
rere irritation and proved to me I
must let it alone.'
"When we began using Postum it
seemed weak â that was because we
2id not make it according: to direc-
tionsâbut now we pu,t a little bit of
outter in the pot when boiling and al-
low the Postum to boil full fifteen
minutes, which gives it the proper
rich flavor and the deep brown color.
"I have advised a gTeat many of my
'riends and patients to leave off coffee
md drink Postum, in fact I daily give
this advice." Name given by Postum
Co.. Battle Creek, Mich.
Many thousands of physicians use
Postum in place of tea and coffee in
their own homes an/1 prescribe it to
patients. "There's a reason."

RICH MEN ARE
NOT ALL HAPPY
Croesus, King: or Lydia, Had Troubles
of His Own, and There Are Others.
Croesus, the John D. Rockefeller of
the kingdom of Lydia, was very well-'
to-do in worldly goods and chattels.
"Ab rich as Croesus" is a saying about
2500 years old. He had his troubles,
however, and some of them were full
i grown. He was taken captive once by
! Cyrus and only saved himself from be-
ing burned alive by quoting a saying
of Solon the Sage. He finally had to
flee his kingdom for parts unknown.
Many of the rich man's troubles to-
day come from high living and could
be avoided. They are brought on by
! eating all kinds of rich, heavy foods at
j irregular times, lack of proper exer-
j else, undue mental strain, unnatural
j stimulants, etc., and are commonly
j known as indigestion, dyspepsia and
j weak stomach. They are serious
I troubles all right, but not only can
j they be avoided but can also be cured,
land;' that without loss of time or
proper food and nourishment.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
certain relief of dyspeptics, rich and
poor alike. There is. no sucht thing as
j stopping their onward progress now.
! A great nation has placed it3 stamp
of approval upon their noble work.
The thousands and thousands of cures
they have effected and the happiness
resulting therefrom have made their
name a household word throughout
the land.
The story of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets enn be told in a word. They
| actually do the work that the weak
Â¦ and wasted stomach is unable to dp
and allow it to recuperat#arid regain
j its strength. They contain all the es-
sential properties that the gastric
juice and other digestive fluids do,
and they digest the food just as a
sound and well stomach would. They
relieve the stomach just as one rested
and refreshed workman relieves the
one on duty that is tired and worn,
and Nature does her own work of
restoration. It is a simple,- natural
process that a child can understand.
1 You can eat all you want without fear
of results. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are for sale by all druggists at 50
cents a box. Druggists all know bet-
ter than to try to get along without
them, as the demand for them is great

While being taken to Jail to-day Mrs.
HIU made s'Jcta a fight on the train
that Constable Fltrgvrald was unable
to handle her alone, and at Pleasanton
got Constable Locke to help him. When
tht-y arrived here the two of them were
unable to take- hsr from the station
to th* Jail, and on a telephc-nic com
munication Deputy Sh-rirr.3 Scanlon
and Queency went' to their assistance.
Unexpectedly she appeared at Liver
more yesterday. She found that her
children were with Miss Hartman. who,
it appears, is her sister-in-law, and*
asked that the sirls bs given to her.
The request was refused, and In retalia
tion she threw stones through the win
dows.
Nothing more was heard from the
woman until Tom Knox. the Postmas
ter at Livermore. received a letter from
her, dated at Lathrop, asking about her
children. He received another dated
at Visalia. and others again from Fres
no and Madera.
She was first seen on December 15,
walking from Livermore to -Altamont.
With her were two girls, one 12. the
other 10 yeara of age, footsore and
weary. It was coming on night when
the elder of the two children applied
to John Kieley. a farmer, for assist*
ance. The mother would accept' noth
ing, but allowed the girls to remain at
the farm.

A woman of Btranse actions, found
wandering about the country near Liv
ermore with two children, was to-day
incarcerated in the County Jail here
under a thirty days' sentence for ma
licious mischief, fehe says her name is
Mrs. Lena Hill and that she once lived
at Reno, Nev. It is said that she went
to the home of Miss Hartman at LJv
ermore and broke all the windows In
the house, for which she was arrested
and sentenced by Justice of the Peace
Taylor to thirty days In Jail.
Entrance to the station was effected
when the agent, Mrs. .Carrie Lapham.
had left the place for the night and the
last local train had passed. After
breaking in the door leading to the lit
tle office in the station it was easy for
the thieves to help themselves to what
was there. Some months ago the same
building was burglarized and a small
amount of coin and a number of tickets
were stolen.
Last Wednesday night the station at
Mount ; Eden was looted and it is be
lieved by some of the detectives at
work on local crime that there is a
gang of crooks engaged in this sort of
thievery.
"ALAMEDA, Jan. 5.â Burglars last

that the job was done by thieves fa
miliar with the practices of the station
agent.
The programme was followed by dan
cing till midnight, and many of the

BOSTON, Jan. 5.â Marvin Hart and
George Gardner of Lowell boxed fifteen
rounds to a draw to-night at the Cri
terion Athletic Club. During the first
part of the contest it seemed Hart
would win. In the second round Gard
ner was knocked down twice, and only
excellent blocking and holding saved
him from a knockout. Gardner came
up strongly in the third, but could not
land effectively. In rounds four and
five honors were*even, but in the sixth
Gardner put in some terrible swings,
which left the Kentuckian groggy, the
bell saving him from a knockout. Hart
showed his superiority in the seventh. ;
At the opening of the eighth Gardner
by holding prevented his being knocked
out, while at the end of the round the
bell alone saved Hart.
From the eighth until the thirteenth
round the fight lagged, but Gardner
put in some hard punches. The four
teenth was fast, but both men were
fired and their blows lacked steam. In
this round Gardner had a slight advan
tage, the bell apparently saving Hart.
Both boxers put up a game exhibition
in the final round and Referee Buckley
decided the match a draw.

Judge W. S. Bell of Pittsburg, who
will Judge the trials, is due here to
morrow night. He will leave for
Bakersfleld and will look over the
grounds on Sunday.
In addition to these is the Champion
stake cup, which must be won three
times before becoming the property of
any man. It was won by W. S. Tevis'
Sam's Bow at Bakersfield and by the
same owner's Cuba of Kenwood at
Coronado. It has not been competed
for during the past two years. Any
dog which h^s won a first prize in an
all-age stake at any trial Is eligible. It
is run in two-hour heats. The heats
for the Derby usually extend over from
thirty to forty, minutes. In the all-age
an hour is the average time.
For 'the first time in the history of
the trials a full complement of cups
are offered. There are three to each
stake and all are about the same value.
The intention is to allow the owner of
the winner in each stake to make the
first selection. The owner of the dog
which finishes second will then have
his choice and the remalninR cup will
go to the winner of third place. The
donors of the cups are:
Members' stakeâ W. W. Richards, J.
W. Flynn.and Western Field.
Derbyâ J. E. Terry, J. H. Schumach
er and W. S. Tevis.
All age â Frank Maskey, Clinton E.
Worden and W. W. Van Arsdale.
The sportsmen who are interested in
setters and pointers are looking for
ward eagerly to the. annual meeting of
the Pacific Coast Field Trials Club,
which begins on Monday next at Bak
ersfield. The does have been on the
ground for some weeks in charge of
skillful handlers.
The entries include the best sporting
dogs on the coast and all conditions
are favorable for a good meeting:.
Quail are reported plentiful, as the
grounds over which the trials will be
held have been patrolled since last Au
gust. They are a part of the Haggin
and Tevis property and are about ten
miles from Bakersfield.

It is not a question of winning or
losing the fight as each vboxer has su
preme confidence in his ability to de
feat the other no matter what his op
ponent might weigh.
There was a great flow of diplomatic
language at the conference. Corbett
claimed he could do 124 pounds and
that he is the featherweight champion.
He did not explain that he would prob
ably have to cut off one of l\'<a legs to
make that weight. Britt said that
while he did not claim the lightweight
championship people were forcing
it on him. 'Then they discussed the
possible engagements they would have
to give up if they made this match.
Corbett said he could* fight Ben Jordan,
the ancient Englishman, although he
did not specify what club would have
the temerity to match them. He also
said he could get a big match In the
East if the authorities would permit it,
which it seems they will not.
Britt said he had a return match
with Canole in sight and also an East
ern offer. The latter was a guarantee
of $3000 to meet three lightweights.
This is less than the loser's end in the
proposed fight. They finally fired of
passing compliments back . and forth
and went their separate ways to din
ner.
Britt put in a heavy day's training
yesterday in view of a possible engage
ment this month. He walked out
through the park to the beach in the
morning. â¢ In the afternoon he bundled
himself in flannels and worked hard In
the Olympic Club gymnasium. His
right fore.arm is giving him much con
cern. He blocked many of Canole's
blows with it and injured the bone.
He Intends having an examination
made of it by the aid of an X-ray.
Young Corbett and Jimmy Britt
talked fight for an hour and thirty-five
minutes last evening, but failed to
reach an amicable agreement. They
are to meet again to-day and it is
expected they will settle their differ
ences in short order.
They had their discussion a!Lto them
selves as J. W. Coffroth, representing
the Yosemite Club, who was the third
person present, left the oratorical box
ers to their own devices. When the
last word was said it was evident only
a, matter of pride kept them apart.
Each had made a stand In the matter
of weight and did not want to give in
to the other.
Question of Losing Is Not En
tertained, as Each Is Supreme
ly Confident of Winning

QUAKER GIRL'S POOR LUCK.
All the railbird reports had Quaker
Girl fit and ready and the Rogers filly
opened equal favorite with Ananias for
the Futurity course sprint following.
She met with poor racing luck under
Bell's guidance, finishing beyond the
money. Ananias, ridden by Hilde
brand, outstayed the 25Â«to 1 shot, Lib
bie Candid, reaching the wire first by
more than a length. Waterspout could
not keep up the first part, but managed
to finish third.
El' Fonse, a 2 to 1 favorite, captured
the mile and fifty yard selling number.
He was piloted by J. T. Sheehan, and
overhauling Hipponax the last eighth,
earned the decision by a length. Milas,
at 12 to 1, finished a fair third.'
James Nealon's Rey Dare had a close
call from defeat in . the seven-furlong
run. The gelding's odds were played
from 2 down to 3 to 2 favoritism, and a
stumble on the back stretch turn soon
after the start looked 'to have put him
out of commission, how
ever, soon made up the ground lost,
and wearing down the lead of Oro
Viva, beat the latter horse out nearly
a length. Twenty to one was chalked
against Prince Blazes and the old fel
low ran third.
Hildebrand carried off the saddle
honors, piloting three winners past
the judges. The 'young man received
quite an ovation for his victory on
Key Dare.
ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
ARCADE FIRST BY A NECK.
Otis, astride Martinmas, met with
poor racing luck and at the wire was
downed a neck by Arcade, the Jen
nings entry, ridden by J. Martin. The
Don was third.
A most ordinary card attracted only
a fair crowd and the betting was not
heavy.' Favorites annexed three purses.
One of the best played horses of the
day was Namtor, which ruled an even
money chance for the concluding mile
and a sixteenth event, and finished
third. Frank Reagan thought his horse
unbeatable and the major portion of
the smart ones unloaded on the New
York horse. Stuyve, the second choice,
with Hlldebrand \ In the saddle, went
out in front when the barrier was re
leased and simply breezed from start
to finish. Burns, on Namtor, was hard
at work all the way and then lost the
place to Joe Lesser by a head.
Coroner Kelly, with Oliphant in the
saddle, snatched . the first event with
out going through the ceremony of
holding an inquest over any of those
finishing in his wake. Sidney Bender's
three-year-old trailed Ethel Abbott into
the stretch and then assuming the lead
won almost easily from the 20 to 1 shot
Isabellita. Emily Oliver, made favorite
because of Tommy Burns having the
mount, ran fourth. The Miller ran a
cheap looking race.
Kenilworth, in the autumn of his rac
ing career, is growing to be a notional
sort of old chap. At times he will fight
out a finish with the determination and
tenacity of a bulldog: and again will
flicker 5 and co out as a candle when the
barn door swing* on It.
The showing made by Harry Stover's
big brown bird In the six-furlong han
dicap at Oakland yesterday made a
skeleton out of many a fat bank roll.
Those who reached the books early got
13 to 10, while the late comers accepted
even money. To be sure Kenilworth
was carrying 126 pounds, but he won
his preViouB race in such commanding
fashion -that it looked as if he might,
repeat. Â¦
A seven minutes' delay at the barrier
caused by .the unruly antics of The Don
did not lessen the favorite's impost any,
and when the barrier finally was re
leased he was away only fairly well.
Possibly the heavy track was not to
the first choice's fancy, either. While
the pace set by The Don did not set the
track ablaze, Kenilworth could not get
to him and in the run home fell out of
the play altogether.

\XXUAL REPORT REVEALS
SHORTAGE IN GOLD OUTPUT
Production of Precious Metal in 1903
for Coast $3,936,622 Iiess
Than in 1902.
The annual report of Director' of the
Mint Roberts and Superintendent
I^each, just issued, shows a falling off
in the gold output on the Pacific Coast
during the year just closed. This
year's yield for California, Klondike,
Nevada, Alaska, Oregon and Washing
ton was $41,071,780, while the output
during 1902 was $44,938,402, or
$3,936,622 more. The reason for the
shortage is said to be due to the fall
ing off of the Alaskan output, though
California was short more than
$500,000.
The output of silver for the year
was $3,207,914. During the year 1902
it equaled S2, 987, 322, or an increase of
$230,592 for the year just closed. ;

Maurice Ttiordan and a'fellow laborer
who were employed on a job out near
the Presidio eat down at the noon hour
Monday to enjoy the contents of their
lunch buckets. Two soldiers from the
post came along and sat down beside
them, engaging them in conver
tion. Cne of the soldiers reached
ever and took a nicely browned
doughnut from Riordan's bucket
and the other found a piece
of custard pie in the other bucket
which suited his taste. The laborers
bore it in hospitable silence. Then the
soldiers made inroads on the sand
wiches. At this Riordan and his friend
arose and smote them mightily. Po
liceman McCue happened alone and
took Riordan in charge. The soldiers
and the other laborer ran a,way. Rior
dan appeared before Judge Mogan yes

peace and was promptly discharged
with congratulations from the court.

LARGE SUM COLLECTED
FOR VARIOUS PERMITS
NEW YORK. Jan. 5. â There were
9768 failures reported to Bradstreet's
in the calendar year 1903. with liabili
ties of $154,277,093 and assets of
$84,060,475. This marked a decrease
in number of just 2 per cent from
1902 and of 8 i>er cent from 1901.
With the exception of 1809, the in
crease over which Is 1.4 per cent, the
year 1903 shows the smallest- num
ber of failures reported since 1887.
Liabilities, however, owing primarily
to the increase in suspensions of
financial institutions, but also because
of the considerable number of heavy
manufacturing concerns supending.
were larger by 45 per cent than those
of 1902 and the v heaviest, in fact,
since 1S97.
There were 956 failures, involving
$S. 328, 362 of liabilities and $3,852,
107 of assets, in the Dominion of
Canada in 1903, a decrease of 12 per
cent in number on a practically iden
tical total.
Owing to the Suspension of Financial

The committee could do nothing,
however, as Messrs. Knight and Mc-
Claren, the experts who are engaged
in examining the accounts of the sec
retary, have not completed their work.
Mr. Foster stated that the committee
would bo unable to take action until
the experts' report was before it and
he could not say when they would
finish their task. He said experts
needed their own time. The finance
committee is anxious to learn the exact
amount of McKowen's defalcation.
There was a special meeting of the
finance committee of the Board of
Hegents yesterday afternoon in the of
fice of Chairman John W. Foster. The
members of the committee, which in

ostensibly for the purpose of examin

When he appeared before Judge Con
lan yesterday he had three tickets ahd
Niggle was on hand to demand four.
The young man explained his attempt
at financiering and Niggle declined to
prosecute him on a charge of felony
embezzlement. Adams managed to dig
up the $3 he was short of in the trans
action and was dismissed. The great
est sufferer is Niggle, who had four
persons ar.d three tickets,- and he is
wondering by what miracle of loaves
and fishes he can make the combina
tion correspond.
Adams purchased . the tickets, and
then he commenced to scheme how he
could make a few dollars on them be
fore he delivered the geods. He be
gan his business career by selling his
first purchase at a premium and ,went
back for five more. At his second at
tempt at barter and sale a policeman
arrested him for "scalping" and two
of the tickets he had parted with were
confiscated. â¢
When Patti appears on the stage at
the Grand Opera-house to pour forth
the munificent melody of her music
laden soul she will miss one face that
she had every right to expect. One
member of the family of John G. Nig
gle, a commission merchant on Front
street, positively cannot attend. It is
not the fault of the family nor of the
singer, but because George Adams, who
may be classed as a rank outsider, be
trayed a trust. ,
Niggle went to the Grand Monday
for the purpose of purchasing four
tickets. There was a Ions line before
the box office and business prevented
him from undergoing the necessary de
lay to reach the window. But he was
not to be balked. With the wisdom of
the serpent he walked along the line
and picked out yvung Adams, to
whom he slipped $12 and his card
with whispered instructions to buy four
choice seats. For the service he prom
ised to give the young man $1- The
offer was accented.
"As a hotel keeper you deserve pro
tection," said the Judge. "But there
are lawyers, doctors, printers and even
working girls in the city who deserve
protection. The hotel keepers should
not have a monopoly on the article.
From the evidence so far adduced I am
inclined to believe that the defendant is
guilty as charged and unless he can In
duce some of these guests to come here
and testify that she was the aggressor
in the trouble I shell so find him. The
case will go over until Wednesday
morning in order to allow him to secure
further evidence."
D. Joseph Smith is steward at the
Baltimore Hotel. With a name like
that he should at least be proprietor of
the Holland House. He was on trial
before Judge Mogan yesterday, charged
with having struck and kicked Miss
Anna McGorty, formerly a waitress in
the hotel. The story pi the assault was
corroborated by Mrs. Jones, also an
employe of the hostelry.
D. Joseph Smith denied that he had
offered violence to the waitress.
said that on Monday morning he had
ordered the complaining witness to
wait on some of the guests and she re
plied in such stirring \vÂ«..-ds that the
gathered guests were appalled and un
able to dispose of their phosphated al
falfa and shredded caraway seeds, or
whatever popular breakfast food is
served in such a refuge of wealth and
fashion. He said he discharged Miss
McGorty and followed her to the office
to see that she received the money
coming to her.
The proprietor was on hand also,
partly in his own capacity and partly
as manager of the court. "I want this
matter disposed of at once," he blus
tered. "I can't be dragged into a police
court by every servant that chooses to
make trouble. I am a hotel keeper
and I want protection. I can't ask my
guests down here to testify to the be
havior of this woman."
Wong Chong anticipated the opening
of the happy New Year season in Chi
natown Monday night by lambasting
How Jim on the head with a section
of eighty-pound steel rail. The delicate
courtesy made a deep impression on
How Jim. It was so deep, in fact,- that
the doctors out at the Central Emer
gency Hospital have been ' trying to
make it bulge out again. How Jim
was unable to appear in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday owing to his injury
and the charge of assault to. murder
against Wong Chons w. ; not gone
into.
The two men were originally arrested
on June 3 and charged with assault to
do great bodily harm. It was alleged
that they had become Involved in - a
row with Lavaginino at the residence
of the two defendants at 3034 Green
wich street and had thrown him down
stairs. It was further claimed that
they followed him to the rear yard and
beat him in a terrible manner. Then
they carried the almost insensible man
to a vacant lot at' Lombard street and
Van Ness avenue and left him lying
against a fence, it is charged. He was
found by a policeman the. . following
morning.
The first hearing â¢ of the case was
before Judge Conlan on December '2,
Lavaginino having been unable to ap
pear before, owing to . his injuries.
Some testimony was taken' and a con
tinuance was had until yesterday. The
defendants In the meantime had been
out on bail. Yesterday the court was
told that the complaining witness was
still unable to appear and granted an
other continuance for one week. Short
ly afterward it was learned that La
vaginino had died at his residence at
607 Greenwich street as a result of
the operation performed upoii him.
Spinetti immediately notified the po
lice that he would surrender his clients
and carried out the agreement a few
hours later.
Francis Rossi and Giovanni Fossa
were surrendered into custody by their
attorney, ex- Judge Spinetti, yesterday
afternoon and their names were placed
on the detinue book at the City Prison.
As soon as a complaint c=n be prepared
they will be charged with murder as
the result of the death S of "Vincenso
Lavaginino. '
"When I entered the office." con
tinued Temple. "I thought the tele
phone girl was the same girl I was
looking for and I tried to liss her. as
I knew if she had been the right girl
Fhe would not have objected to my
salutation. Then she shrieked and I
discovered I had made a mistake."
Temple, when seen in the prison,
thought it was all a huge Joke. He said
he heard that a young girl to whom
he had sold a book had gonÂ» to the
Starr King building and he went there
in search of her.
Policemen Maloney "and Young were
notified of the disturbance and they
hurried to the building and placed Tem
ple under arrest on the charges of dis
turbing the peace and battery upon the
telephone girl.
The screams of the two young ladies
were heard by two men who happened
to be in the corridor and they ran into
the office and grappled with Temple,
Mho fought desperately to get away
from them. He might have succeeded
if two of the elevator young men had
not appeared on the scene.
Shortly after 2 o'clock Temple, who
Â¦was under the influence of liquor, en
tered the office of the building on the
second floor. He indicated his desire
to talk to the telephone girl and when
she leaned over the counter he threw
his arms arÂ»und her neck and at
tempted to kiss her. She screamed and
Major McLennan's daughter, who was
in the office, ran to her assistance and
Temple, releasing his hold of the tele
phone girl, tried to get hold of Miss
McLennan.
William R. Temple, who nays he is
a brmk salesman, caused considerable
excitement on the second floor of the
King building on Geary street
yesterday afternoon and as a result
hf is locked up in the City Prison on
charges of disturbing the peace and
battery.
The matter of the petition of An
drew J. Clunie for a distribution to
him of a portion of the property left
him by his brother, the late ex-Con
gressman Thomas J. Clunie, was given
a partial hearing in the Probate Court
yesterday and then continued until to
morrow. The hearing was very short,
being confined principally to the ad
missibility as evidence of an agree
ment to separate made in 1902 by
Clunie and his wife. The agreement
is in the hands of the executors, and if
admitted will, the attorneys for the
widow say, go a long way toward prov
ing that Mrs. Clunie's contention that
the Clunie estate is community prop
erty is based on facts.
It is expected that the present pro
ceedings will lead to a contest of a
portion of the will of the late politician.
It has been inferred that Mrs. Clunie
contemplates contesting that portion, of
the will bequeathing to her re-alt y in
this city and Sacramento worth about
$200,000 and claiming under the law
governing community property a wife's
half of a husband's estate. In the event
that she is successful she will gain
nearly $300,000, as the estate was ap
praised at more than $1,000,000.
A claim upon the executors of the
Clunie estate for forty-two shares of
stock in the Pacific Coast Redwood
Company was made yesterday by the
trustees of ihe Navarro Investment
Company. They claim that the stock,
though appraised as part of Clunie's
estate, was simply held in trust for
them by Clunie. An affidavit filed by
J. F. Olark purports to show that their
claim is a valid one.
Among the other matters requiring
attention arethe demands for room in
the education building for the Univer
sity of California and the- requirements
for space in the mining building for
the minerals, ores, apparatus, etc;, that
have been collected under the direction
of State Mineralosrist Aubury to rep
resent California's mineral industry. ! .
Secretary "Willis of the California
Commission to St.- Louis says that
Lieutenant Governor Alden Anderson
is mistaken, if he is correctly reported
as saying that the California State
building is oh a badly selected site. -It
is, in fact, says Mr. "Willis, as near the
center of .the grounds as possible. . It
is only, about. 200 feet from the agricul
ture building, in which California
makes its greatest exhibition. This is
a matter of importance and also of
convenience. It is among a cluster of
great buildings, among which are the
Illinois State building and the Temple
of Fraternities and not far from the
Japan exhibit.
The Jerusalem concession is also near.
Mr. Willis says that these facts should
be generally understood. The hill was
selected for a building site because it
-would make the California State build
ing very conspicuous.' The location and
the architectures of the California
structure, which is of the mission type,
will be certain to attract attention.
To settle the pending questions con
cerning the exhibition space to be given
to California at the St. Louis exposi
tion. Commissioner Filcher has gone..t-i
St. Louis. The California State build
ing, is about three-fourths completed
and requires inspection. The space in
the' agriculture* building to be occupied
by the exhibitors frpm this State has
been arranged; but there is some ques
tion about, the' location of the wine ex
hibit. -Â¦Â¦â¢- â¢

to take Kelley's wife away from him
and when she refused to part with her
husband he visited the Kelley domi
cile, shot Kelley in the shoulder and
Mrs. Kelley's mother in the arm, fired
one shot at Mrs. Kelley and then shot
himself through the arm. Judge Mogan
told Monahan that he sincerely hoped
the Superior Court would send him to
the penitentiary for ten years. ' *
During the day he held a consulta
tion with Captain of Police Spillane,
who has charge of the Southern sta
tion, where most of the cheap lodging;
houses are located. Nightly in these
places men and women are packed like
sardines in buildings of a highly com
bustible character and a disastrous fire
in that section would undoubtedly re
sult .in a holocaust appalling to con
template.
In the order there is a section mak
ing it obligatory on the Chief of Police
to see that all lodging-houses are prop
erly equipped with fire escapes and
that their locations are indicated by
red lamps of a specified character.
Judge Conlan issued a recommendation
to Chief Wittman that a thorough ex
amination of all the' lodging-houses in
the city be made and where this pro
vision was not complied -with within
a reasonable time that arrests be made.
He promised the police all the support
that his court could afford.. He issued
a similar recommendation to the fire
wardens.
The terrible catastrophe in the Iro
quols Theater In Chicago promises to
bear some fruit of caution and preven
tion in San Francisco, if the recom
mendations made by Judge Conlan in
his court yesterday morning are heeded.
Matilda Smith was before the Judge
on the charge of violating order 127
of the Board of Supervisors in neg
lecting to provide red lamps to indicate
the location of fire escapes in a lodg
ing-house she conducts at 307 Fourth
street. Her counsel explained that she
was ignorant of the provision and if

Lawyer Applewhite, acting as attor
ney for Howard Laws, the night watch
man of the* steamer Alliance and the
most important witness on behalf of
the Government, called the attention
of Judge de Haven yesterday to the
fact that Laws had been confined in
jail for a long time as a witness and
asked that he be released. Judge de
Haven declined to interfere, but sug
gested that the proper course for the
lawyer to pursue would be to apply
for a writ of habeas corpus.
Judge de Haven of the United States
District Court yesterday ordered an
attachment issued for Mrs. A. H. Ames
of Marshfleld, Or., to appear.as a wit
ness against Thomas Davis, a waiter,
arrested last Monday by United States
Secret Service Agent Hazen for an as
sault committed upon Mrs. Ames while
she was a passenger on the steamer
Alliance on October 16. Mrs. Ames
represented that she had no money
and could not afford to pay her ex
penses to this city, so the attachment
was issued to enable the United States
Marshal to bring her to this city as a
prisoner at the expense of the United
States.

Judge Vandeventer then called the
cape of Senator Dietrich, in which Die
trich is charcpd with profiting by the
lease of a building to the United States
Government to bo used as a postoffice
at Hastings while Dietrich was a mem
ber of Congress. District Attorney
Summers read a telegram from Attor
ney General Knox stating that an im
portant witness had left Washington
and would arrive here on Thursday.
The District Attorney said that coun
sel for Senator Dietrich would not agree
to proceed on certain conditions with
out the presence of the witness, and
he therefore requested a continuance.
General Cowin, counsel for the defense,
stated that Senator Dietrich was ready
for, trial and entitled to as speedy a"
hearing as possible.
The court sustained the District At
torney, and continued the case until
January 7. In announcing "the contin
uance Judge Vandeventer said it was
the opinion of the court that the Gov
ernment should have sufficient time to
carefully preDare its case, and that
Senator Dietrich should have an oppor
tunity to vindicate himself in the face
of any and all evidence that the Gov
ernment wished to present.
OMAHA, Neb.. Jan. 5.â To-day's ses
sion of the United States Circuit Court,
before which is beins: tried the case
of United States Senator Charles H.
Dietrich, â¢ lasted but an hour. Court
adjourned in order to permit the Gov
ernment to present a witness coming
from Washington.
The first business transacted to-day
was the arraignment of Tostmaster Ja
cob Fisher or Hastings, who was in
dicted on charges similar to those
against Senator Dietrich, and in the
same connectionâ that of alleged bri
bery in securing his appointment as
Postmaster at Hastings. Fisher plead
ed not guilty and waived preliminary
examination. His trial was set to fol
low that of Senator Dietrich.

The decision is hinged on Ihe fact
that the Board of Supervisors in or
dering by resolution the planting of
the trees did not act on a written
recommendation by the Board of Public
Works that the work bo done as the
charter provides. "No recommendation
to do the work in question," says Sea
well, "was ever made by thv? Board of
Public Works ,and the Board of Su
pervisors had therefore 'no jurisdiction
to order- the trees to be either planted
or maintained."
In connection with the obsliuction
complained of Sea well says:
"The trees in question, while they
do not seem to be a very serious inter
ference with the property rights of the
plaintiffs nevertheless do, at the points
where they are planted, obstruct free
access to the stores and premises of
the plaintiffs from the roadway to the.
street. . That plaintiffs have the right
of unobstructed passage from the street
to their premises and from their prem
ises to the street cannot be questioned
and as the trees complained cf have
been planted without authority of law
and in violation of the injunction of
this court plaintiffs arc entitled to a
decree requiring their removal."
. Judge Sea well decided yesterday that
the Board of Public Works had no
authority to plant trees alona; the edge
of the sidewalks in City Hall Square
and issued a mandatory order re
quiring the board to remove them. The
decision was rendered In the suit of
George T. Marye and other owners of
property fronting on the square against
the Board of Public "Worksâ an action
brought on the ground that the Board
of Supervisors exceeded its authority
in reducing: the width of the avenue
and on the further ground that the
planting of the trees prevented a free
and unobstructed passage to the build
ings facing on the avenue.

Poultry mid Game.
The receipts of domestic Poultry were light
j and there was no more Western received.' 'ihe
â¢ market was in good shape for all kinds of large
I fat fowls, large young stock > especially being
in demand. Small and poor stock was rather
dull, but prices were no lower. A car of
Western is scheduled for to-day's market.
Dressed Tnurkeys sold slowly, and tt ' Â¦ wu
difficult to obtain 22c even for the best stock.
Only four cases came la. . .
Game was in good request, and. although the
receipts were liberal, tbe market was well
cleaned up at the close. Prices had but slight
quotable variance.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter merchants report a better movement
as a coneequence of the decline in prices a

aa they were, while the feeling is steadier and.
In ' fact, some dealers are reporting a firmer
tone in fine creameries. Prices, however, re
main unchanged.
Cheese Is very weak, with the Inside quota
tions lowered a fraction and dealers anxious
to 'bell, even at concessions. Oreson continue*
a liberal shipper to this market, and now Utah
Is offering to s?ll here. -Stocks continue ex
cessive.
Egg3 showed less, easiness yesterday, and in
fact the lower irradc? were quoted as showing
more tone. It. is stated that two cars of East
ern' have been recently reshipped East at a
narrow profit to the local shipper.

The Lumber Trade. ,
Corn was Inclined to decline early In the
session and was weak in sympathy with wheat.
The local crowd were against the market and
sold freely. During the latter part of the day
considerable covering developed and there was
also active buying by the same Interest that
supported the wheat market. Increased offer
ings from Illinois and Nebraska were "largely
responsible for the bearish attitude of the local
traders, although the more hopeful tcne of war :
news exerted 6cme influence. .The close was
fairly firm, with May only UCf^SC lower . at
4C%c, after opening a shade higher, to \^@V*c
lower at 46%c to 4G%c. ;
Oats were- the firmest of grains. There was j
a little decline early along with other grains. ,
but the market nteadied later, and during the ;
latter part of the eession gand gains were
made on active covering by shorts and on buy- j
Ing by some of the local bulls. A good cash i
demand helped In the advance. The close was !
firm near the top. After opening unchanged to
a shade higher at 3.S%@38%c May ranged be
tween 33% c and ."KHic closing at 39V&C
A decline of 10c In the price of hogs and
liberal receipt? caused considerable selling of
provisions early in the day by commission
houses and local bears. As a result May pork
declined 60c, lard 20c and ribs 22Â»>c. On the ,
break packers supported the market and some I
recovery was made, although the close was I
weak, with May pork off 57 %c. May lard down
22 %c and ribs off 15@17%c.
The leading futures ranged as follows: "

CHICAGO, Jan. 6. â Wheat opened with an
easier feeling and a general Inclination to eell.
English consols were higher and the general
tone of foreign dispatches referring to the
possibility of war was decidedly more pacific.
Receipts also were more liberal and the weather
map gave promise of excellent conditions for
the movement of the crop. At the start May
was unchanged to V 4 c lower at 86%c to 86^e.
and with no suppprting features the market
continued to decline. The weakness at Minne
apolis- added to the depression here, and before
the declining tendency had been Checked May
had sola eff to S5>;c. or a loss of lc from the
high point. At the decline there was liberal
support from commission houses and the lead-
Ing long also supported the market with large
purchases. As a result the market rallied and
part of the loss was recovered. The late
strength in coarse grains was a help during the
last hour, and a steady tone prevailed at the
close, with May at S0<gÂ£<Â«**c. Clearances of
wheat and flour were equal to 399,900 bushels.

NEW YORK, Jan. 5.â The stock market to
day was rather dull and decidedly spotty and
the tone was Irresrular throughout. The tone
showed icme improvement after London had
ceased trading for the day, but the late'
strength' was not held and the closing was
irregular after a sharp reaction. The specu
lation wan varied and Drices did not move
fully :n unison. London's Influence was largely
responsible for the early heavy tone, although
the pending action on the United States Steel
dividends and the question of the showing to
be made by tee quarterly earnings statement
were repressive influences on the general list.
The announcement that the directors would
not assemble until 3 o'clock left the assurance
that the dividend decision would not be known
until the market had closed and -caused addi
tional hazard in the trading. Speculative feel
ing on the subject was indicated by the bet
ting on the- curb on the dividend prospect,
heavy odds being offered against any dividend
being declared on the common stock. .
Another active center of speculation doring
the day was Amalgamated Copper, which was
run up at one time over two points. Other
leading copper Btocka, including' Rio Tintog In
Parig, were active and quite buoyant. The
London market for raw Â¦ copper continued to
advance on large purchases and the official
price in the domestic market also rose sharply.
Some effort was made to make the war rumor
a factor lii the copper situation, owing to the
Japanese croductlon in the world's eupply of
copper. The war scare as a factor off- the
market, however, showed a waning Influence.
A prominent feature .of the day's trading
was the marking up of a group In smaller
railroad stocks in which a common Interest ia
largely dominant. Chicago and Alton, Colo
rado and Southern, Toledo, St. Louis and
Western, Minneapolis and St. Louis and Iowa
Central also were Included, in the group, and
Chicago Terminal Transfer -might be added.
Rumors to explain the rise varied from a
transcontinental railway project to embrace
Union Pacific. Chicago and Alton, Toledo, St.
Louis and Western and Erie to a combination
of the smaller roads into one property after
the manner of the Rock Island system. No
authoritative Information could be had on any
of the rumors. Rock Island was conspicuously
weak on the" larce decrease 'in net earnings
reported for November and helped to unsettle
the closing market. United States Steel also
weakened suddenly,' carrying back the pre
ferred with it for practically all of its earlier
Bonds were irregular. Total sale*, $1,770.-
C0O. United. States bonds were unchanged on
call.

The contest for the position of naval
officer, port of San Francisco, is en
gacinff the attention of the California
Congressional delegation. Senator Per
kins has recommended William C.
Ralston for the office and Senator Bard
has declared in favor of William M.
Cutter.
The activity of the aspirants and the
interest displayed by the delegation do
not disturb the -equanimity of Colonel
John P. Irish. Each of the aspiring
Republicans entertains the hope that
Colonel Irish will be tempted to resign
by the offer of a very lucrative salary
in another field of enterprise. It is re
ported that the colonel has advised
both Senators Cutter and Ralston to
place their respective indorsements on
file. According to the gossip in the po
litical camps the advice has been ac
cepted. Men eminent in financial and
mercantile circles testify to the worth
and capability of Senator Ralston.
Others equally prominent in the busi
ness world indorse Senator Cutter as
a man of high character and excep
tional fitness. It is said that names of
leading Republicans In every county of
the State may be found on the peti
tions.
The incident comes to light that Sen
ator Ralston was recommended to the
President before former Congressman
Woods withdrew from the contest.
Some of the politicians are circulating
the report that brie of the members of
our delegation in Congress openly sup
ported one . aspirant while he sec/etly
espoused the cause of another. Other
politicians insist that there was nothing
more than a trivial mistake.
It is claimed that the entire delega
tion was solid for Woods and that the
indorsement of another was filed with
the understanding that it was. not to be
considered as long as Woods was in the
field.
An old timer in the ranks of the party
made this comment on the topic at the
Union League Club yesterday:
"This story that a member of our
delegation was supporting one candi
date while holding out the glad hand
of promise to another ought not to be
accepted as a fact. Such political tac
tics may be countenanced by raw East
erners, but our Congressmen fight in
the open. It is all right for aAnember
of Congress to send to the President all
the recommendations he receives. The
responsibility is thus passed up to the
appointing, power, where it belongs.
"Perhaps it was surmised that Woods
was not acceptable to the . President
and another name was sent in for the
convenience of the executive."

why he should repudiate his signature.

Mrs. Maud Lawrence was arrested
yesterday afternoon in her rooms In
the Bay State Hotel on Stockton street
by Detectives Cody and Ed Gibson on
a warrant issued by Police Judge Ca
baniss charging her .with forgery. The
complaining witness is J. H. Swift,
president of the Columbian Banking
Company.
Mrs. Lawrence, it is claimed, pre
sented three checks at the bank within
the last few days and they had been
honored. One was for ?10, the second
for $50 and the third for $100. They
all purported to be signed by J. W.
Laymance, real estate dealer, 632 Mar
ket street. Laymance admitted that
he had signed the check for $10, but al
leged that his name had been forged to
the other two checks. They were all
made payable to Mrs. Lawrence.
. Mrs. Lawrence called at thc bank
again yesterday with another check
for $100 purporting to be signed by
Laymance and payment was refused.
President Swift decided to have her ar
rested and the warrant was sworn to
before Judge Cabaniss.

Dorn says he made a proposition to
Golden to ask the Attorney General for
permission to sue in the name of the
people in order to determine who was
legally entitled to the office, but Golden
refused, saying he was going to hold on.
The writ of injunction sued out by
Dorn to restrain Golden and Gallagher
from interfering with his possession of
the office of Justice of the Peace will
be heard in a few days in the Superior
Court.
What adds to the complication cngen-'
dered by the appointment of three men
to one office, the Mayor having named
Walter Gallagher, is that presiding Jus
tice of the Peace Van Nostrand recog
nizes Golden as the legal Justice
of the Peace. Van Nostrand says that
he will assign no cases to Dorn or
Gallagher, and the entanglement will
not be settled until the courts^ finally
pass an the matter.
Gallagher has made no Mtemnt to
take the office, but may serve Dorn as
the latter served Golden by breaking
in the courtroom before Dorn arises to
morrow morning. Golden continued the
transaction 'Of judicial business all the
afternoon in the Justices' clerk's office,
while Dorn held the fort in the court
room, without, however, doing any
Golden left vowing vengeance, say
ing that he would open a courtroom in
the office of the Justices' clerk. Dorn
thereupon sent for ; the. police, and two
officers patrolled, the corridor in front
of the courtroom during the day.
Dorn got up before Golden, and when
the latter appeared in the courtroom
he found Dorn in possession. Dorn had
taken the precaution to put * an
other lock on the door to which he
alone had the key. Dorn informed
Golden that he (Dorn) was the legal
appointee to the office and ordered. him
to leave the courtroom. Golden refused,
and thereupon, assisted by R. W. Sims,
his attorney, and a deputy fn City
Attorney Lane's office, Dorn pounced .on
Golden and hustled him from, the room.
The Justice of the Peace, imbroglio,
in which the Governor, Mayor and
Board of Supervisors have all . taken
a hand, reached an unpleasant climax
yesterday in a disgraceful scene in
which Walter E. Dcrn. the Supervisors'
appointee, forcibly ejected Isidore Gold
en, the Governor's selection/from the
courtroom formerly occupied by ex-
Justice of the Peace Long," which Gold
en had taken peaceable possession of

Postmaster Fisk said yesterday that
he. would not make any appointment

In view of the testimony given by the
disgraced official on the examination of
J. TV. Erwin before United States Court
Commissioner Heacock the administra
tion determined to dispense with his
services. Erwin was dismissed for
having assisted Richardson in urging
the adoption by the department of an
expensive time indicating device for
letter boxes which cost the Government
many thousands of dollars. According
to the evidence adduced Richardson
was the head and front of the conspir
acyâIf there was a conspiracyâ to bribe
Machen and Beavers with stock of the
company so as to insure the adoption
of the device by the Postal Department.
Under these circumstances, when it be
came known that the Federal Grand
Jury of the District of Columbia had
indicted Machen, Beavers and Erwin
and had allowed Richardson to go scot
free, there was considerable surprise,
not unmixed with indignation, on the
part of the public of California.
But the" department only waited for
the induction Into office of the new
Postmaster before it laid Richardson's
official head upon the block and chop
ped it off.
Richardson's dismissal was ordered
by tho Postoffiee Department in Wash
ington, the order having been transmit
ted to Postmaster Fisk by telegraph.
No explanation was given by the
Washington authorities, the telegram
simply instructing, the Postmaster to
dismiss Richardson immediately.
