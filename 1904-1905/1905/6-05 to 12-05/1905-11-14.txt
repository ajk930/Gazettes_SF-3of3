Secretary Shaw Refuses to Go
to the Aid of Specu

SpÂ«cial Dispatch to The Call
r WASHINGTON, Nov. IS. â Secretary
of the Treasury Shaw believes there Is
money enough In circulation to tide
the banks over the bard places and the
national treasury will not co to the re
lief of speculative Interests. National
banks, however, may use their sur
plus to meet the stringency.
NEW YORK, Nov. 13. â In the Wall
street squeeze money tightened to-day.
The monetary situation became more
acute and the deadlock between the
barks and tn*.* borrowers of funds on
stock exchange : collateral remained
unbroken. Call' money ran up to
25 per ' cent, the highest price at
which money on call has been loaned
since September, 190?, when an acute
monetary crisis developed.
The bank statement on Saturday,
showing that certain banks had dip
ped into their legal reserve to assist
borrowers in their demands, clearly
foreshadowed another active day in
Wall street. Those institutions which
.bad their surplus wiped -out and- were
drawing upon their lawful reserve
made vigorous efforts to replenish
their deficits. The tffect of this was
speedily Sfcn in the stock market. Se-.~
curities were weak on the calling Of
loans, high priced stocks in particular
declining sharply, but there was in
evidence a confident atmosphere about
the borrowers oi funds. Support was
frequently extended the stock market,
and while there was liberal selling by
commission houses, big borrowers of
money boldly supported their stocks.
The result was that the usual procedure
cf lightening loans and obtaining cash
for reserves through market liquidation
was to some extent frustrated and post
poned. The bulls in stocks cheered them
selves by repeated reports that Secretary
Shaw would finally come to the aid of
the money market und indirectly to their
assistance. As a result they willingly
paid fancy prices for temporary use of
fund?.
The uprush of loaning rates also caused
a serious slump in sterling exchange. In
which demand bills on London sold down
to the same prices at which gold was
imported from London nearly two months
ago.
The belief that ultimately relief would
come from the treasury and that gold
would be imported from London made
borrowers somewhat Indifferent to the
rates demanded by the banks. At the
close of the stock market, however, the
deadlock, which became critical when
money reached 25 per cent, remained un
broken. The day was most exciting for
money brokers, exchange brokers and
stock brokers, while in the banks and
trust companies where brokerage ac
counts are kept the scenes around the
loan windows clearly reflected the scar
city of money and the necessities of the
borrower*.
On the floor of the Stock Exchange the
excitement of different groups seemed to
be concentrated. Borrowers of money on
slightly margined accounts at banks
found themselves sold out. On many of
the loans ' the collateral consisted of so
called pool stocks, and these were thrown
on the market. Reading was the chief
sufferer of the day, losing an extreme
cf 6*4 points. Metropolitan Street Rail
way, Smelting common, Brooklyn Rapid
Transit and other active stocks lost from
t to 2 points.

Grand Jury Returns Number
of Indictments for Elec
tion Frauds.
Special Diipatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 13.â Charles' F. Mur
phy may retire voluntarily from the lead
ership of Tammany Hall If Mayor Mc-
Clellan should Join the Tammany leaders
who are dissatisfied with Murphy's man
agement of the city campaign and should
suggest the " advlsab.tity of such a step.
This hint was dropped by Murphy's
friends to-day after his return from At
lantic City and his reappearance at Tam
many Hal! for the first time since the
day after election.
There is only one bright spot In the elec
tion returns for Murphy, and that is the
snowing under of the Mcuarren machine
in Kings County. The feud between Mur
ph.r and Senator McCarren has been re
opened and if the Tammany leader re
main In power he will not rest . until', he
has obliterated McCarren as a factor in
Brooklyn Democratic politics. It is- re
garded as a ; significant, fact that, while
the friends of the/Mayor are blaming
Murphy forMic refusal;.tounomlnat9^Dls-.
trict Attorney Jerbnw,': f or the^predomi-"
nance of the, gas -issue and for other ele
ments of weakness. Murphy's . partisans
are blaming the' Mayor, for, insisting upon
the hollow truce i between Murphy and
Senator McCarren. -
Murphy had- little to say to-day. He
would not discuss. the general result, nor
would he attempt to account for the large
Hearst vote.
"Who is elected, McClellan or Hearst?"
was asked.
"McClellan," Murphy replied with em
phasis.
"Have you seen Senator McCarren since
the election '"
"No; . I have not seen McCarren," Mur
phy replied, and he smiled as he said it.
At a meeting held to-night at the office
of former Judge Alton B. Parker, at
which were piesent twelve attorneys, all
of whom have been retained to represent
Mayor McClellan to-morrow when the
Board of Canvassers will meet, it was de
cided to rely entirely on the existing
election decisions and the law as it is re
corded in the statutes. Parker pointed
out that there was only one question
involved and that was covered by the de
cision of the Court of Appeals, which was
written by him. He said that it was a
dangerous practice to open the ballot
boxes and in his opinion it was not within
the province of the law to do so.
A large number of indictments in New
York election fraud cases were issued by
the Grand Jury to-day. Immediately
afterward bench warrants were issued.

CZAR HAS SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
TROOPS WATCHING THE POLES.
READY FOR REVOLT
Civil War Certain Unless Revo
lutionists Change rlan.
ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 13. â Private
and reliable reports from Warsaw to
6ay say that all the parties there are
joining in the nationalist movement,
following: the tactics of Finland, for a
complete strike. So long: as their at
titude of passive resistance continues
the Issue will bÂ« one of endurance.
The danger is that the Poles may pro
voke active measures which would
mean nothing short of civil war. It
would be extremely difficult under the
present circumstances toj attempt to
withdraw any troops from European
Russia. The number of troops in
Poland, however, is sufficient to cope
with the situation. Within the Polish
quadrilateral there are more than
â¬00.060 trooi>s.
The Government has derided to make
an appeal to the peasants. With the
workmen of the cities completely es
tranged there is nothing left but to
turn to the peasants and the Emperor
has approved a ukase reforming them
that measures for the amelioration of
their rondition will receive immediate
consideration. The discontent of the
peasants and th# danger of the spread
of the agrarian movement largely con
tributed to the Government's decision.
The council of the empire this aft
ernoon decided to remit a portion of
the land payments due next year by
the peasants in the provinces affected
by the famine. The council also de
cided to remit entirely the payments
for 1906 due on land held by peasants
killed during the war. The amount
remitted totals J18.000.000.
Disquieting reports of the progress
of the agrarian disorders were re
ceived to-day. The military authori
ties are rushing troops and machine
guns into the affected areas. Inhabi
tants of Karek and Tugansk are or
ganising for the protection of their re
spective towns. The village of Balan
dai in tbe Government of Saratoff has
been fired by peasants.
As their nÂ«>xt step the Social-Demo
crats have decided to attempt the en
forcement of an eight-hour day In all
the factories of St. Petersburg. The
workmen in a number of big factories
liave already resolved to work only
eight hours for tiieir present pay and
to cease work entirely if the employ
ers attempt to enforce the old scale.
Count John Tolstoi, who resigned
the position of hcaÂ«l of the Academy
of Fine Arts on account of General
TrepofTs repressive policy, was to-day
uppointed Minister of Education.
Among the Socialist leaders is Vera
Z&ssuUcli. who. taking advantage of the
piociamation of amnesty, hats returned to
Ru-ssia.
Vera Zassulich. who was expelled from
Russia, has for many years been one of
a group of leaders, who from Geneva and
oth^r co pita !s have been directing the So
cialist propaganda in Russia, and who. It

there. S!ie 'ince attempted the life of the

ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 13.â The
League of Leagues has adopted a reso
lution condemning the proclamation of
martial law in Poland as an illegal
measure directed against the Polish
emancipation movement.
The Rusky Slovo prints a dispatch
from Warsaw describing a conversa.
tion which Governor General Seal on
had with a deputation of prominent
Poles, during which the Governor Gen
eral distinctly announced that he
would not allow the organization of a
municipal military. Moreover, he
added, he would neither remove the
troops from the city nor the streets
arjd he warned the deputation that he
was prepared to deal with the situa
tion should the agitation be communi
cated to the masses.
In addition to increasing the pay of
the rank and file of the army the War
Department has decided to decrease
the term of service by one year. The
present pay of the infantry-is 11 cents
per month and the cavalry 14 cents
per month. i
The f*ars of the wholesale pillage
and murder of the Jews and intelli
gencia by the "Black Hundred" has
not entirely disappeared, although the
strictest precautions have been taken
against probable outbreaks. Two stu
dents were beaten to death near the
Obvorny Canal last night, three house
porters were murdered at their doors
and many domestic servants left their
work", announcing to .their mistresses
that labor was no longer necessary, as
now everybody waa on an equality,
having become "citizens," and would
receive Government pensions.
An eminent diplomat, speaking of
the situation to-day, said:
VThe difficulties which confront
Count de Witte on every side are enor
mous and would overawe a man of less
dominant will and capacity. His task
is almost superhuman, but I do not
regard it as impossible."

ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 13â The
second session of Count de Witte's
Cabinet was held this afternoon. One
of the matters under consideration was
the project for placing the Council of
the' Empire, the Upper House of the
National Assembly, to a certain ex

de Witte insisted upon before accept

of the principal causes of the long' de

ing her husband a claim >to a share of a
$25^.000 estate have not served to dazzle
the mental perspective and to destroy the

Ord i* son of Judge' John Ord and a

former English ruler. Mrs. Ord said to
day:
Xeltfcw my husband nor I feel ex

Ords are not looking for titles. If the property

J. R. Bailey, manager of X the Western

to the royal family of England,:- and
showed him duplicates of the papers men

BLUEJACKETS AT BANQUET.
Men ot Two Navies Have High Time
In' Gotham.
NEW YORK, Nov. 13.â The famous say
ing "Blood is thicker than water" never
found more impressive expression than it
did to-night at the dinner at Coney Island
which the enlisted men of .. the first
squadron of the United States Atlantic
fleet gave to the enlisted, men of the sec
ond cruiser, squadron of. his British Ma
jesty's navy, commanded by Rear. Ad
miral Prince Louis of Battenberg. It was
the keynote, of the cheering with which
the 2500 British and American i sailors
made the great pavilion ring to the echo.
It was the toast to which they drank
across the long . tables which stretched
down the great hall beneath the over
hanging British and American flags. It
was the theme of the speeches that ac
companied the cigars and the beer of this
mammoth feast, unique in the history of
all navies, and which will long furni3h
the theme of yarns : on . many a British
and American warship.
Coney Island in the vicinity of the-Bow
ery Pavilion looked as if, midsummer had
returned. The fakers were about the In
closure .long befons the sailors, and the
all-the-year-round residents packed the
('approaches: to \the hall, Inside the pic
ture -Was "one ; which surprised , even the
men themselves ; , who .; had worked ' all
night in its construction. . Overhead a
frieze of British and flags
stretched around the hall. From each of
the twelve chandeliers swinging from the
ceilins down the center of. the hall
waved four American and .four; British
flags. The balcony railing 'was intertwined
with the colors ', of . the two nations. Fes
toons of bunting were draped across from
one balcony to the other, caught up in
the center by : great globes of â¢ electric
lights.-
Across the lower end of the main hall
was a long table with four smaller tables
adjoining at right angles. These were

CHRISTIANIA, Nov. 14.â At 2 o'clock
this morning the returns fo the plebes

in its main features is now possible. The
results in "418 constituencies show 233.935

Takes Firm Stand
for American
Canal.
PITTSBURG. Nov. 13.â 01 d City Hall
was crowded to-day when Samuel Gom
pers called the American Federation of
Labur to order for the annual convention,
which this year Is the sliver anniversary
of the organization. All the delegates,
representing every State In the Union,
Ca::aUa aad other foreign countries, were
in iheJr seats and all available space out
tide was utilized by visitors.
Shor'ly before 10 o'clock the delegates
assemlkd at headquarters in the Colonial
liotel and, headed by a monster band of
LS pieces made up of federated musicians
in Pittsburg, marched through the prin
cipal streets to the place- of meeting.
A^ President Gompers and his second
vice president^ John Mitchell, entered the
hall Jhcre was prolonped applause. A
few minutes later President Gompers
rapped for order and introduced S. C.
Dougrla?, chairman of the local entertain
ment committee, who welcomed the dele
grates; on behalf of the labor organiza
tions .of the city.
The presentation of credentials was the
first matter on the programme and oc
ciipied considerable lime. One of the in
teresting tights to he settled at this con
vetuion is the trouble between the Plum
bers and the Steam Fitters' Union. It is
said the uSiciaJs of the Teamsters' Union
will make an effort to unseat William J.
Spencer, the plumbers' representative in
the executive council.
President Goinpers Is out for re-elec
tion and It is generally believed that he
will be successful. The other officers are
likely to be re-elected with the exception
of Fifth Vice President Thomas 1. Kidd,
who is not a candidate for another terra.
W. D. Mahon, president of the Amalga
mated Association of Street and Electric
Employes of Detroit, Mich., probably will
â¢succeed him.
Durinp the report of the committee on
credentials it developed that a number
of labor unions In different parts of the
country had failed to pay the assessment
levied by the American Federation of
Labor for the benefit of the striking New
England textile workers. These unions
were given representation -in the conven
tion to-day, but will be compelled to make
the payments before to-morrow.
fIEPORT MADE BY GOMPERS.
At the afternoon session President Gom
pers began the delivery of his report.
President Gomoers s-aid In part:
Mr last report utated that "we thai! no
tfoubt fee confronted with the keenest oppcei
tlon !n the near future." This prediction
haÂ« been fully verified. Despite the more
general understanding that the trade union
organisation of the working people Is essen
tially necessary to them and is of general ad
vantajr* to all our people in the great work
for tU<? b.-ttermpr,t of their material, moral
end social rendition, yet we cannot but de
plorp tb<? fact that ignorant, vicious and bitter
smsponism has been leveled against our fcu
mex.izing movement by a number of co-called

oughly than ever before to organizing the yet

At the annual conven
tion of the American Fed
eration of Labor, which
opened in Pitts burg yes
terday, President Gom
pers tendered a long re-^
port, the most startling
feature of which was his
advocacy of insurance
amofig the labor unions.
His proposal was called
forth by the exposures re
cently 7?iade of flagrant
abuses of trust among the
big life insurance comp
anies. Gompers takes a
firm stand for Chinese
I exclusion.
cause of humanity, to, 1 am sure, wÂ« are In
hearty accord with the sentiment of gratitude
and keen sense of appreciation for the. act of
the President of the United States, who found
the heart of the world akin to him In bring
ing to an end the frightful carnage and war
between Russia and Japan.
May we not look forward to the time, have
w* not the right to hope. that, all other means
falling, the waÂ«re earners of the world wilt be
so thoroughly organized, and will understand
their interests and their ' rights " so well, that
they will refuse â¢to permit themselveÂ« to be
arrayed against their brother -workmen of an
other country for the purpose of serving thÂ«
machinatione* of tyrants, whether political. or
commercial? . .
Organized labor stands for peace, industrial
as well as International, carping critics to the
contrary notwithstanding. ' We want Interna
tional peace. All mankind yearns for it; hu
manity demands H.
You will be much gratified to know that dur
lr.g the last year there were fcrmed an Inter
national league for the organization of women
Into trade unions, and that im work has been
attended with considerable success. \t has
boen not only my duty, but a- pleasure to aM
Its officers and members In the furtherance of
that work. True, many or Jts officers are not
wage earners, but are women and men who,
anxious to help their sisters of labor, realize
that that assistance can beFt be rendered by
organization where they may be in the better
position to help themselves.
PROPOSAL FOR INSURANCE.
There is no good reason why our union*
should not. apart from their protective, trade
and labor features, become the guarantee to
our members for the payment of. benefits by
reason of illness, unemployment, loss of tools,
superannuation, traveling, death. . etc.
Surely, .recent investigation* have demon
strated beyond question how largely the wage
earners of our country arc mulcted by exces
sive premiums paid to so-called insurance com
panies and societies. Our unions, by their very
economy of administration, by their experience,
as well aÂ« by their mutual Interests, do and
can give greater returns Jor dues paid than
any other institution on earth. .
As against the objection of some who assert
that these features are not the functions of
unions is the answer that the functions of the
trade union movement In the Interests of the
working people are without limit.
As against the aspersions of opponents, we
fearlessly aseert and can easily demonstrate
that, man for man, or association for associa
tion, the officers and the great rank and file
In our movement are a* honorable, high mind
ed, faithful and honest ac any of our critics or
opponents, either in their individual or asso
ciated life.
As ajjainst any notion that the accumulation
cf large funds for the payment of benefits as
well a> for the protective features would provp
temptations to dishonest*, unions which hayÂ«
already established these features manifestly
dlsproTs
It may appear paradox:cal. but it' is never
theless true, that there has been less dishon
esty or maladministration in Union* having ac
cumulated large funds than Jn those in which
large funds have been conspicuous by their
absence.
FAVORS CHINESE EXCLUSION.
At thl3 late day it la scarcely necessary or
profitable to present the reasons for Chinese
exclusion. Surely, they are not appropriate
here; but we cannot stand Idly by and without
prot'rt permit the machinations of come who,
lost to all conscious responsibility to their fel
lows and for an apparent Immediate greed of
gain, fcheme to Inaugurate a vicious policy
which would Inevitably lead to the deteriora
tion of our race, undermine our civilization
and destroy our very lives. â¢ \u25a0
We make no prtense that the exclusion ' of
Chinese can be defendec upon a high Ideal,
ethical ground, but we insist that it is our es
sential duty to maintain and - preserve our
jihyeclal condition and . standard of life and
civilization, and thus- to wnire vi tha oppor
tunity for the development of our Intellectual
and moral character. - Self-preaervatlon has al
ways been regarded as the first law of nature.
It Is a principle and a necessity from which
we ought not and must not depart.
Surely, America's workmen have enough to
contend with. . have ; sufficient . obstacles con
fronting them In their struggle to maintain
themselves In their humanizing movement for
a higher and a better lire without" being re
quired to meet tba enervating, killing, under
selling and' unoerllvlng . competition of that
nerveless, wantless people, the Chinese. \u25a0 ;"
There can bÂ« no question that Japanese
Immigration Into Hawaii has had a most bane
ful. Influence and result: but it Is a queer, no
tion' that will eeek relief from the evils re
sulting from Japanese Immigration and work
by turning to the Chinese, and it shows a per
verted conception ' of real economy, justice and
Americanism.
We insist that the Panama canal and its
zone 'cannot' be regarded as American In one
particular and non-American In "another. * We
are just aa Intensely Interested as . any other*
osn be in the. necessity for and the advantages
that will result '- fi cm the construction of the
Panama canaL but we equally Insist that It
shall be the- result of -American enterprise,
American genlue and American labor.â '
Wholly apart from the consideration 'of the
law' excluding Chinese latmrers from America.
Its islands and possessions,- the economic, po
litical *nd Â«ocial features must have a deter
mining influence.' The experience which' we In
our own country had wltn Chinese laborers on
the' Pacific CoaetT and' elsewhere forbids - tha
thought that Chinese 'should be employed, upon
the canal. . M __^..*..:- :* \ .:.^._<__ .._ \u25a0

HEBREWS SUBSCRIBE

Throughout San Francisco
Synagogues Are Gather
ing .Relief Funds.
.San Francisco has again given proof
that her people are the most generous
of any. city in the United States. The
subscriptions to the Russian relief
fund up to yesterday afternoon com
pare most favorably with those of any
city of twice Its population. P. N.
Lillenthal wired $10,000 to Jacob H.
Schiff, New York, early yesterday,
though he, had up to that time a little
less thfen $7500, but he knew the senti
ment of California people, and the con*
tributions before evening amounted to
$12,169 15. In; a day or two he ex
pects to wire an additional $10,000.
Some of the contributions have a
special; significance, not so much for
the munificence, but as coming from
those of scant means,; and again from
many non-Jews, whose hearts respond
to the appeal of the unfortunate of all
nations and every creed.
"The children attending- Rabbi Levy's
Sabbath-school contributed their little
savingsand sent $114 to Mr. Lilienthal
for the starving Jews of Russia.
The Gemilus Chasodim Association, a
society which advances moderate sums
to respectable indigents, without inter
est, at a : meeting held last Sunday,
donated $100 to the fund.
The employes \u25a0of M. Siminoff con
tributed $44 75 collectively.
A public, meeting will be neld under
the auspices of the Hebrew Free Loan
Association to-morrow^ evening in
Lyric' Hall, 121 -Eddy street.- to voice
a protest' of this "community against
the outrages and appalling crimes com
mitted by lawless mobs against the
Jews in, Russia/ It is also intended to
appeal to President Roosevelt request
ing, him to take steps in the name of
the people of the United States to pre

SCOTT'S. EMULSION.
BOTH FOOD
AND MEDICINE.
We like best to call Scott's
Emulsion a food-medicine/ It
is a term that aptly describes
the character and action of
our Emulsion; More . than a
medidne^ â^more than a food,
yet combining the vital prin-
ciples of both. It is: for this
reason that Scott's Emulsion
has a distinct and special
value in all wasting diseases.
There is nothing better to
remedy the troubles of im-
perfect growth and delicate
Health in children. The action
of Scott's Emulsion is just as
effective in treating weak-
ness and wasting in adults.

a cell floor of the County Jail, in which
Blaker admitted' to. him his part in the

'His.^testimony was attacked by'At

'(TdTestions put by Frick, \u25a0 Crowhurst
said revenge was'his object in playing

he was in the cell with Crowhurst at
the time he was talking to Blaker, who
was in the "Cell above, and took down
'what he heard in shorthand.- He was
allowed to read it to 'the jury. In the

"OLD CLOTHES" IDEA
STIRS COLLEGIANS
Result of- Postscript of Eng
lish Club's Banquet
Invitations.
BERKELEY, Nov. 13.â The exclusive
and fashionable English Club of the uni
versity, including in its membership Pro
fessor Charles Mills Gayley and a host
of lesser lights of the classical realm, is
greatly agitated to-day as the result of
an innocent appearing suggestion ap
pended to the club's invitations to a ban
quet to be given at the California Hotel
on November 18 ;in honor of ..Margaret
Barry, the famous reader.
Miss Katherlne Hershey, secretary of
the club, is the cause of the storm, for
it was' Miss Hershey who, as secretary,
add<Hl to the formal invitation r to -the
banquet these fateful words: "Old
clothes."
Various members of the English Club
fancy that the "old clothes"' suggestion
can be construed as a slight upon the
guest of honor. Other members of the
club affect to believe that the secretary
has exceeded her powers in suggesting to
guests the desirability of appearing in
."old clothes."
Miss Hershey said to-night: "This ap
pears to be a tempest in a teapot. I
meant nothing more than that it was
all to be informal. Mr. Kurtz, president
of the club, suggested that the members
be told of the informality that would
prevail at the banquet, and I followed
"his suggestion."

CRIME'S BLACK SHADE
ON KENNEDY'S CAREER
Dead Man Shown to
Have Been Noted
as a Crook. !
His Misdeeds Are
Known All Over
Civilization.
BERKELEY, Nov. 13.â New light upon
the criminal career of "Matt" Kennedy,
the .desperado killed- by. Policeman Le
slrange in West Berkeley On - September
28,' revealing him as one. of the most ex
traordinary crooks of the. century, has
.been shed by the Pinkerton detective
agency, Marshal Vollmer to-day receiv
ing important details of the dead thug's
life of crime. - .. \u0084 â¢ â¢'
Kennedy's origin is traced back by the
Pinkertons to his life as a hoodlum. boy
In Detroit. From that obscure station he
passed into the limelight that beats upon
a dangerous, expert criminal, to whom
robbery^ and murder and jail life and jail
breaks are common affairs, j Kennedy was
called a "swell crook", because^ of , his as
sociations with . men who turned "large
tricks," and in his fraternity Jhe was so
dearly, loved by his fellow, criminals that
one of them, the .notorious "Blinkey"
Morgan, killed a detective while attempt
ing to rescue Kennedy from the clutches
of the law.
RESCUE THEIR COMRADE.
"Blinkey" Morgan was hanged years
ago for the crime .through which. Ken
nedy made his escape. The killing took
place while Kennedy was being escorted
from Allegheny City,- Pa., to Cleveland,
Ohio, in charge of Detective William
Hulligan and Captain Hohne of the Cleve
land -Police Department. Kennedy had
stolen a lot of valuable furs in Cleve-
I land and was arrested in Allegheny City.
While being taken back ! to. Cleveland a
%and of desperadoes, headed by "Blinkey"
Morgan, boarded the train at Ravenna;
Ohio, and" began to beat the .two police
officers with pistols, slungshots and other
weapons. They called on Detective | Hul
i ligan to liberate Kennedy, but. that could
not be done by the officer, as Kennedy
was chained to his wrist by handcuffs.
The thugs beat out Hulligan's brains and
knocked Captain Hohne into insensibility,
fracturing his skull. Then the handcuffs
were broken and the gang escaped.
"Blinkey" Morgan was captured later and
was hanged in Ohio for the murder, of
Hulligan. ,' . -
The remainder of the band, including
Patsy Hanley, William Harrington and
Matt Kennedy, fled to Australia. When
they were finally . located there : the Ohio
authorities would not go. to the expense
of extraditins: them, and so two of the
gang, Hanley and Harrington, remain to
this day in Australia. ' Strange to relate,
Hanley, one of the criminal associates of
Kennedy and '\Bllnkey"; Morgan, Is a
.we'altfiv /resident .of ' if Ade.lai"de, Australia,
'apparently .* respected* by .the .community,
and Harrington is also comfortably situ
ated at Sydney, Australia. -,â¢â¢- -?...â¢>.....;./
CAME HERE WITH- HOWARD.
Kennedy i remained withÂ» this crowd in
Australia for 6everal years, coming to
San Francisco five or six years ago with
"Plunger" Howard and the gang whose
robbery of the coin vault of the steamer
Alameda provided a lot of San Francisco
Police Department history a few yejirs
ago. -'' Mr. Pinkerton of Chicago writes
now:
At that time (in San Francisco) Captain of
Detective* Lees called the attention of : Mr.
Pinkerton to the pictures or the seamen (the
gang from Australia) and, showing him the
picture of one, said: "Here is an American
among them, but he has lived in Australia fif
teen years." Mr. Pinkerton immediately Iden
tified the picture of the American as Matt
Kennedy, who escaped from this country at
the time of the Hulligan murder at Ravenna,
Ohio. -.iT'^- -
At this time Kennedy, alias McMunn,
was In custody in the City of Mexico,
charged with stealing $10,000 in bills from
a bank there. He escaped, returned to
Chicago, and from ; there made a' trip
around the world two and a half years
ago with a band of crooks, going to Lon
don, to South Africa, to Australia, and
thence to San Francisco. Last win
ter he was arrested at Dallas, Texas, with
other suspicious characters, but before his
picture could be' Identified by the North- 4
crn police, to whom it was sent the Dallas
police allowed Kennedy to go, as nothing
was known- against him there.
IDENTIFICATION, POSITIVE.
Kennedy's luck on that ocassion was ex
traordinary, but the escape" was so nar
row that he at once left the country, go
ing again to Australia. He returned last
summer with a small band^ofi 'crooks,
planned to rob . the I bank, at West Berke
ley on September 28, met Policeman Le
strange- in hiÂ« path shortly; after mid
night, drew a revolver, on 'the officer and
was instantly killed by the latter.
The Pinkerton agency says now of Ken
nedy: , < -;''^y';: * ."â¢-,\u25a0 \u25a0
7*hls man, starting from a ' hoodlum boy . Jn
Detroit,- had traveled I the world MJver, , been in
all sorts of society, and from ! a common-look
ing chap developed into one of the handsomest
crooks in the country. He was known aa "Raf
fles" among the crooked fraternity. . He was
one of the . last men In the .world who, from
his appearance, would ever .bet aken for a
crook. â¢ -'\u25a0/;-", ; - -
The identification of the, dead thug by
the Pinkertons as Kennedy is | positive
and has since. been cOnfirmed;by Captain
Michael Evans of \u25a0 the bureau of . identifl-;
cation of the Chicago Police ' Department
and by Chief of Police Fred? Kohler' of
Cleveland, Ohio, both of - whom knew
Kennedy. '

HAS NEW PLAN
Submits Scheme to the City
Council of Chicago to
Secure Street Eailways
THREE ALTERNATIVES
Would Either Purchase or
Condemn Roads or Build
System of Parallel Lines
CHICAGO. Nov. 13â Another ordinance,
providing for etepe to secure municipal
ownership of the street railways in Chi
cago, was submitted to the City Council
to-nlgtot by Mayor Dunne.
The ordinance was accompanied by a*
message to the Aldermen which gave
throe ways in which Mayor Dunne as
eerts he will be able to bring about mu
nicipal ownership. The first plan is by
reaching an agreement with the traction
companies by which their property would
be transferred to the city at a price de
cided upon by arbitrators. The second is
by condemnation of the property of the
etreet railway companies under "the pro
visions of the Mueller act. The third
method is the one which the Mayor has
already presented as an alternative to
his contract plan. It is for the construc
tion of municipal street railway lines
which will parallel the lines of the exist
ing companies.
The ordinances, which accompanied the
tnessage from the Mayor, asked that au
thority be given to place on the ballots
e-t the spring election the question wheth
er the city shall Issued Mueller bill cer
tificates to the amount of 575,000,000. This
Bum, lt Is declared by the Mayor, is need
ed for the reconstruction of the lines and
for the purchase of the unexpired fran
chise rights of the existing companies.
The message and the ordinance were
referred to the committee on local trans
portation, the same fate which met the
other propositions submitted to the Coun
cil by the Mayor in regard to the munici
pallzation of the Chicago street railways.
Another ordinance submitted by Mayor
Dunne was one for the regulation of gas
end electric light rates. This ordinance,
which provides for 75 cent gas, was re
ferred to the committee on gas, oil and
electric lights.
PRESIDENT TO REINSTATE
DISMISSED CHAUFFEUR
"WASHINGTON. Nov. 13. â Walker El
dridge. tfte chauffeur who was dis
missed from the Government service
for misconduct which came under the
personal* observation of President
Rocsevelt. will be reinstated In his old
position at the end of two months from
the date of his dismissal. The exer
cise of leniency by the President is
due to Eldridge's excellent record In
the Philippines, to the fact that his
father was a veteran of the Civil War
and to the additional fact that his
â¢wife is an invalid.
In directing the young man' 6 rein
statement the President made it clear
that in his opinion the cause of his
dismissal was sufficient, but that under
the circumstances he did not desire to
be harsh with Eldridge.

CONVENTION OF CLUBWOMEN
MEETS AT CALIFORNIA HALL
SPEAKERS BREAK RECORDS
Civic Clubs Show Stupendous Influence
for Progress in City and Town.
PROMINENT OFFICIALS OP THE SAN FRANCIBCO DISTRICT OF THE CALI
FORNIA FEDERATION OF WOMEN'S CLUBS AND TWO "\u25a0 MEMBERS WHO'
MADE ADDRESSES AT THE ANNUAL SESSION YESTERDAY.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
What think you of a convention of wom
en wherein thirty-two of them said all
they had to say In three minutes each?
To be sure, they had more to Bayâ yards
moreâ but the convention rules allowed
three minutes, and they manfully' stuck
to the compact. True, there were a few
who broke through, but the convention
as a whole beats all club records for
obedience, brevity and relevancy. For
these thingsâ the things women need most
to learnâ it stands as a record-breaker,
for which credit must be given the district
president, Mrs. F. V. Gorham of Vallejo,
and her parliamentarian. Miss Mary Fair
brother, as well as to the speakers them
selves. â¢ :
This Miss FairbrothÂ«r Is * feminine Tom
Reed, and her very presence Is a threat
to the verbose and rambling convention
speaker, that makes of conventionsâ
which ought to be gainful and pleasur
able â a slow death.
The morning session of the San Fran
cisco district convention of the California
Federation was opened In the California
Club house with prayer by Mrs. H. S.
Lewis.
Mrs. Aylette S. Cotton, president of the
hostess club, welcomed the delegates and
friends In a fashion becoming a club
bearing the name "California."
Then followed the greeting from the
State president,- Mrs. Josiah Evana
Cowles. Mrs. George Law Smith, the past
State president and greatly beloved lead
er, was unable through illness to preseni
her report upon the General Federation,
And then came those^ famous three
minute reports from the presidents ol
thirty-two clubs â the reports that will
set a new standard of 'intelligence and
Christian charity In women's delibera
tions. Yea, verily, are we learning
though the light cometh slow.

"PINK EYE" EPIDEMIC
IN CITY OF CHICAGO
Special Dispatch to The; Call.
CHICAGO, Nov. 13.â "Pink eye" is said
by. some of the prominent physicians of
the city to have reached the -proportion
of -an epidemic in Chicago. School chil
dren are among the worst sufferers, the
pupils at the Doolittle School having felt
the scourge for more than a week past.
. The disease Is one of the most con
tagious known to medicine and sometimes
travels through an entire . family. On
the first signs of inflammation near the
corner of the eye a physician should be
consulted. If no correctlve;measures are
used, suppuration will start and continue
for a day in the eye affected. When a
cure is near the other optic becomes af
flicted In the same way. The patient has
then a pair J .f>f,, > e,yes of the kind that have
been . ref erjr^Gto as looking, like "burnt
holes in a blanket," and he Is kept busy
using applications to keep them open..
"Pink eye" has only, one thing to
recommend itâ lt is not fatal. It generally
lasts three days. - \u25a0"-;' â¢â¢\u25a0*--

STUDENTS MAY
DIE OF WOUNDS
James McGavrey of an Ohio
Seminary, Who Was At
tacked in Room, May Die
CASE A DEEP MYSTERY
May Be Connected With the
Tragedy Attending Recent
Initiation of Fraternity
'GAMBIER.O.. Nov. 13.â James E. Mc-
Gavrey, the Bexley Theological Seminary
student who was found bound and gagged
in his room 'on Saturday -night, is In a
precarious condition and fears are ; enter
tained-that he will not recover. .He suf
fered^, several * convulsions " to-day, and
physicians say he is on. the verge of com
plete nervous, collapse. He suffers great
pain in his right. side and. it is believed,
he was kicked while unconscious by the
men who bound and gagged him. '
Early this fall McGavrey underwent an
operation for. appendicitis and he had not
fully recovered from this when "he was
attacked Saturday. ;
McGavrey's mind is not yet clear and
he is | unable to tell anything of the as
sault, which will 'give a clew to the police
at work on the case ' ,
Not only to. the police but to the cpl
lege authorities as well is the assault a
mystery. Dean Jones of Bexley Hall
said to-night that it i:Â» a well known fact
that students in the seminary are poor, a
majority of them working their way
through college. His statement strength
ens the belief that robbery was not the
motive for the assault on McGavrey.
One theory is that McGavrey. was *in
possession of information which would
throw further light on the death of Stu
art Fierson. a student in the college, who
was killed by a passing train while bound
to the railroad tracks during a fraternity
initiation. The attack may have been for
the purpose of Intimidating McGavrey.

the Tacoma Coast League team and the
Fresno State League team. Tacoma
won by asto 0 score. In the third in

Fresno's pitcher, filled the bases and
Truck Eagan walloped the ball for a
three bagger. Aside from that onl bad
streak O'Brien, on whom Mike Fisher
has his eyes, pitched excellent ball.
Fitzgerald pitched for Tacoma.
This 'morning Mike Fisher met with
the Fresno fans and talked over his
proposition to bring the team to Fresno
for next season. Committees were ap
pointed by the fans to get $10,000 to

Should it be raised the chances are that
with his Tacoma franchise Fisher will
come here in preference to Spokane.
Fisher likes the short' jumps which
games at Fresno instead of far north

King' 1 and All Hands .
Applaud. '
NEW YORK. Nov. 13.â Madison Square
Garden held what was declared to be the
most brilliant assemblage to-night when

berg lent his presence as an, added dis
tinction to the formal opening of the
twenty-first annual horse show under
the auspices of the National Horse Show
Association. The erarden had been open
during the day and judging of various
classes had been in progress, but it re
mained for the evening to give the show
Its social Impetus and Bpectacular effects.
Two classes had been judged to-night
and eight high-stepping tandem pairs
were on the tan bark when the first
strains of "God Save the King" came
from the band as a signal for the ap
proach of Prince Louis. Throughout the
evening the thousands In the garden had
been on edge waiting the arrival of the
guest of the evening. As a mark of
respect to the British national anthem and
in eagerness to catch a first glimpse of
the Prince, the throng rose to its feet.
In another moment Prince Louis was seen
leading the way to the boxes which had
been set apart for his party and a great
cheer went up.
All during the playing of the anthem
the cheering and applause continued. The
Prince stood eilently at the entrance to
his box, gazing out upon the unusual
scene. As the last strains of the music
died away the Brince stepped forward
and the cneerins was renewed, this time
in greater volume and more enthusiasti
cally than had been the first greeting.
Again and again the Prince was com
pelled to bow his acknowledgments.
Prince Louis arrived at the horse show
just before 10 o'clock. He was accom
panied by the officers of his staff. Rear
Admiral Evans. Majer General Wade and
ladles of the party. The Prince was
greeted at the garden by the officers of
the Horse Show Association.

"BIG BILL'- KNAPP DRIFTS HOME WITH AVONALIS
High Chancellor
Gallops Away
With Purse
Cloudlight Downs
Hot Favorite
Fireball.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
If all of the favorites at Oakland
yesterday had performed like High Chan
cellor and The Lady Rohesia the big
Monday crowd would have swept up quite
a bunch of money. But while Avonalis,
Judge Denton, Epicure- jand Cloudlight
came in at prices as fat as a goose, they
were not "eagleblrds," and the ring failed
to profit thereby.
Â»L. A. Bonsack's Oddfellow horse, High
Chancellor, made the other three, starters
in the mile and a sixteenth purse look
like 30 cents. McÃride had the leg up on
Chancellor, and at odds of 2 to 5 he made
a gallop of it, beating Reservation and
Briarthorpe. Warm and balmy weather
failed utterly to thaw out Bragg.
If there is anything in morning work
outs then St. Francis looked like a little
frosting off from the top for the. opening
two-year-old dashl But there isn't, for
"Big Bill" Knapp, astride Avonalis, slid
away in the lead, winning very handily
from St. Francis. An explanation" goes
with the latter, but that will not cash
any tickets. Iron Watson took â¢the show
from Barney Schreiber's Laura Van. The
winner's odds were backed down from 10
to Tto 1.
There was a notable gathering of fast
platers In the six-furlong run, decided un
der selling conditions.- Half a dozen looked
to possess a chance, and there was no
pronounced choice, though F. E. Shaw
and Lustig enjoyed a slight call. Neither
created much disturbance in the race.
Through diligent use of the bat Washing
ton hustled Judge Denton, a 12 to 1 shot,
over the mark, less than a length before
Ed Lilburn and Cousin Carrie.. Princess
Tulane ran fourth, and will take some
beating. next time out.
Nobody fancied the chances of Epicure
to win the seven-furlong "selling number
but the railbirds, and they're all broke
flatter than a pancake. The smart ones
could see nothing but Good Cheer* and
sent the Williams entry to the post a 4
to 5 chance. She did the best she could
for Eddie Walsh, but Epicure tow-roped
her from start to finish, scoring by three
wide-open lengths in 1:27? i. Potrero
Grande showed. V \ ffl (
If business continues"' brisk Dick Wil
liams will get some curious prices about
his horses before t^e end of the week.
He turned Fireball over to the care of
Jake Holtman in the five and a half fur
long sprint, and Cloudlight,' a 9to 1 out
sider, with Radtke up, turned this one
to the wall. A gilded reputation caused
the rush to climb aboard Fireball, mak
ing the colt a 4 to 5 favorite. Cloudlight
received stable support, and skimming off
in front beat the first choice out a third
of a dozen lengths. Davis, on Albert Fir,
lost the show to Princess Wheeler.
The Lady Rohesia, a 6 to 5 favorite,
with Aubuchon up, made a runaway af
fair of the closing .mile and fifty, yards
event. â¢ Isabellita secured second place
honors from the heavily played San
Primo.
XOTES OF THE TRACK.
While at the post In the second race
E. Walsh, on Lustig, incurred the dis
pleasure of Starter, Holtman, and was
set down for ten days. , ; -
At the post In the fourth event Mc-
Bride, astride High Chancellor, grew
over anxious t<\ get away. He received
a $50 fine ana three days' vacatlou
on the ground from the starter.
Through the misinterpretation of a
telegram received by Secretary Treat
it was given out that Charley McCaf
ferty and his horses would leave La
tonia for Calif drnia on Sunday night
last. As a matter of fact Dr. Leggo and

Sharpen, His Wind arid
Make Him Fleet of Foot
AL NEIL HOME AGAIN
Brings Startling News That
Tim Murphy Holds a Pair
of , Titles in Australia
Long road running has been dis
pensed with . at Mike Sullivan's train
ing quarters in g an Rafael, and from
now on until the day before his con
test with Jimmy Gardner on November
24 he will ' replace these long runs
with short sprints. Sprinting makes a
boxer fast on his feet, sharpens hia
wind and strengthens his \ underpin
ning, and altogether 'is most beneficial
to one who has a contract on his hands
such as Sullivan has with Qardner.
Sullivan s put In a hard day yester
day. After the sprinting in the morn
ing, which lasted for more than an
hour and a half, ha sat down to a
hearty lunch and at 3 o'clock he was
ready for his Inside work. He first
punched the bag for twenty minutes
and then' he did a lot of shadow box
ing, after which he put on the gloves
with his brother Jack. The pair of
twins boxed four hard rounds and the
spectators : were satisfied when they
had seen Mike with the gloves on that
Jimmy Gardner, has trouble ahead.
Wrestling and rope skipping concluded
the â¢ day's work and Sullivan then re
tired to his dressing-room, where he
received a good rubbing down at the
bands of his trainers. .
\ Al , KTeIH. once the pride of the local
boxing world, arrived from Australia
yesterday on the steamship Sierra.
Neill looks in <good trim and said he met
with fair success in the Antipodes, se
curing many matches and beating a
number of likely men in that section of
the world. A 1 says they are pulling
off a lot of fights in Sydney and the
larger cities and the game seems to be
paying there.
Neill brings the startling news that an
cient Tim Murphy is now the champion
middle .and heavy weight of Australia
and the champion heavy-weight of Af
rica. Murphy gained his former title in
the latter part of September, when he
stowed Billy McCool -away in eleven
rounds. He later annexed the African
championship by putting it over an
other star. The game must be com
paratively easy in Australia when Mur
phy can hold two titles. He would be
fighting a long time around this village
before he could even annex a battle.

JORDAN WRITES
ON ATHLETICS
Resident of Stanford Airs
His Views Regarding Pro
fessionals and Amateurs
2vO HOPE FOR "BUSHERS"
Students Who Play Ball for
Money in Summer Cannot
Perform on Varsity Team
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 13.â
President David Starr Jordan expresses
his Interpretation of the much dis
cussed Question of "amateur athletics"
In the Stanford Sequoia, which was Is
sued to-day. The article Illustrates
each phase of the topic and is clearly
and forcibly set forth. It Is Interest
ing to observe the stand which the
learned scholar has taken, as the ques
tion is one of growing importance. Es
pecially emphatic are the statements
regarding the baseball standard. This
phase has been open to considerable
question, which was illustrated by the
diversity of opinion when the two star
players of the California baseball nine
were disqualified by Colonel Edwards.
Dr. Jordan corroborates action similar
to that of the Berkeley professor. To
enforce his statement he has defined
the two classes of athletes as fol
lows:
An amateur la onÂ« who does something tot
the love- of It. the thlngr he doÂ«s having no re
lation to his livelihood, and he being under no
responsibility to master any part of It, except
that which contributes to r.'s pleasure.
A professional In any field is on* who make*
It his business, and whose livelihood ta In
some degree dependent on hia success In bring
ing about result. The idea of professional
work Implies the effort to master the tedtoua
as well as the agreeable features of the worlc
under consideration. Tha agreeable part 9 on*
may take because he likes tnem. the others bÂ«
cauae- thty are essential to success.
In regard to the way professionalism
enters into university sports he states;
Tha normal attitude of the college man to
ward athletics Is that of the amateur. Ha
takes part In games because he enjoys tha
game â and sometimes also t-.ecau.se he enjoy*
the praise of his fellows, when he plays with
skill or nerve. However attractive athletic*
may seem, they cannot become the chief busi
ness of life fcr a college man. To exhibit on*'*
atrensth or skill for money is not a lofty Ideal
of life â not one worthy a college man's ambi
tion. Besides the career Is a very short one.
Tha suppleness of youth !s as fleeting as th*
proverbial duration of beauty. A3 a baseball
player Van Haltren. the "boy wonder" of the-
Middle West, is many years my Junior. To
day ha Is termed affectionately "Rip Van Hil
tren." the grandpa in the Pacific Coast League,
lie la cM for baseball, but as a lawyer or engi
neer a man of his age is In hU early prime.
So the athletics of the college man Is ama
teur athletics. It i 3 this that gives It ltÂ«
charm to j tha world at large, which for the
most part ia not made up of amateurs. It Is
not that amateurs put up a better game thaa
professionals.- They (To not. They have neither
time nor inclination to give to athletics that
single-hearted attention which would develop
professional success. It is because their -t
forts are fresh.- spontaneous, enthusiastic; be
causo they do not represent all that the boy*
can do: because the boys themselves are chil
dren of hope, preparing themselves f&r greater
thtng3, which, when the time is ripe, they will
attack with the same enthusiasm as that with
which they now buck the line. It i 3 for all
this that the professional world, vexed, jaded,
worried with petty things, conies forth to do
these free eouts honor.
In regard to football the number of
professional players is far les3 than in
other sports, but at baseball the most
marked tendency is naturally found.
He states in part:
Every summer clever athletes of the univer
sities are offered money to play on these "bush
leagues." sometimes even on the main league
of the Pacific Coast. If a young man needs
the money and doesn't find the association too
unpleasant, let him. play; there is nothing
wrong* In that. But when he joins the "huso
league" let him keep oft the college team, lie
belongs to another class, a class of better ball
players, no doubt, but not the class to which
hia college mates belong.
"When he plays ball for money anywhere he
can no longer stand as the representative of
those who play, because tney love to play.
He has stepped out of the class of amateurs
Into the class of professionals. In colleg*
games his place Is henceforth on th* bleachers,
the same- place as the college man occupies
when it is hia fortune to witness a game of
professionals. This . distinction between ama
teur and professional every good Stanford ath
lete must learn to draw, xr he cannot see th*
distinction ha la already professional ia his at
titude toward athletics.

IN COLLISION ON BAY.
STEAMER MADRONA RUNS DOWN SCHOONER
Nonpareil's Deck
hand Is Thrown/
Into Bay.
The I'nited States lighthouse tender
Madrona, a chronic offender against the
'.aw which requires vessels passing along
the water front to give the ends of the
wharves a. wide berth, yesterday ran
down the gasoline schooner Nonpareil,
causing death to one man, serious injury
to another and damage to the schooner.
It was just the kind of accident that the
law the Madrona so frequently violates
was designed to prevent.
The Konpariel. with Captain William
SJjnphy at the wheel, left Pacific-street
wharf, bound for Redwood City. The
Nonpareil's whistle sounded until she
reached the end of Pacific-street wharf.
Jackson-street wharf extends further out
than Pacific, but the Nonpariel's whistle
Is loud and shrill and the made all the
announcement' of her departure that the
law requires. "When she got out in line
with Jackson-street wharf the Madrona,
Captain Anderson in command, suddenly
appeared. She was close in to the wharf
and tearing along at Â», full speed. The
Nonpareil sounded two whistles. Indicat
ing her intention of passing ahead of the
Madrona. The Madrona replied with one
whistle, meaning that she would cross
the- Nonpareifs bow. Confused by the
cross whistles. Captain Murphy ordered
the Nonpareils rngines stopped and then
reversed at full speed. It was too late.
however, and the Madrona struck the
Nonpareil's starboard side with a heavy
crash.
John Borr, deckhand on the Nonpareil,
tried to block the blow by inserting a
fender between the Nonpareil's side end
the Madrona's bow. The vessels came to
gether with such a jar that Boer was
thrown overboard. Jie fell between the
two vessels .and was not seen again. The
.iar that thrt-w Boer overboard pitched
Captain Murphy over the schooner's
wheel. He sustained an ugly cut on the
nose and internal injuries, which may
prove eerious.
Murphy was taken to the Harbor Hos
pital and the Nonpareil, which was leak
ing, headed for Mission flats, where sne
now rests on the mud.
This is the Brst serious trouble the
Madrona has caused, but Captain Ander
son's habit of skirting the wharves has
been responsible fÂ«Â»r many narrow es
capes, and the Madrona, on this account,
has long been classed as a menace to bay
navigators. Yesterday's tragedy \u25a0will be
Investigated by tho Government inspec
tors and in addition the lighthouse board
will hold an independent inquiry.
Boer, the man who lost his life, was
unmarried and came here recently from
Chicago. He was about thirty years old.

LABOR UNIONS
AND THE CHURCH
Miles L. Farland Discusses
Toilers' Organizations
fore Meeting of Ministers
IS FOR HALF HOLIDAY
Speaker Declares That lie
Is in Favor of a Five-
Day Week for Workingmen
Labor unionism, the present Labor Un
ion administration of the city jof Sari
Francisco, and the .religious, social and
economic problems of the labor organiza
tion were discussed by Miles I* Farland,
before the Presbyterian Ministers' meet
ing, 920 Sacramento street, yesterday
morning.
Among, other things Farland said he
hoped that the church and the unions
would come reciprocally in touch. He ad
vocated that ministers use every endeav
or to help and win for; the- laboring man
a Saturday half-holiday. He was in fa
vor of only five days' work, but would be
happy if the half-holiday could be con
ceded. ' : ' '
In his trade there had been correspond
ing Improvement in the, men with the re
duction of hours. The, result had been 60
per cent Improvement. Ten: years" ago
they toiled fourteen and sixteen hours,
and the extreme labor had much to do
with the moral unrest of the laboring
man. ~;^v-
A question was , asked Farland as to
what the labor unions thought about
President Roosevelt refusing to submit to
the demands on the Government by a
labor union and the President's reply that
individual independence would be respect
ed on the part of tlÂ» Government, wheth
er union or non-union. V
Farland admitted that a Government
must be free In the matter of employ
ment, and he thought that It must have
absolute control of its employes, and that
public sentiment would regulate the
wages and hours of labor.
The President, he said, had a liberal
spirit and believed in organization.
.The Rev. J. H. N. Williams spoke be
fore the Methodist ministers' meeting yes
terday on "John Knox, the Reformer. 1 '
The Jewish massacres In Russia were
brought up before the Congregational
Ministers' Union yesterday morning -by
the Rev. George C. Adams. D. D., pastor
of the First Congregational Church. Dr.
Adams hoped that the churches would
join In a contribution for the sufferers,
and announced that a movement to that
effect would be made in his church.
A resolution expressing sympathy with
the persecuted Jews offered by the Rev.
I. C. Meserve, D. D., seconded by the
Rev. C. R. Brown, was unanimously
adopted. ;
Reference was made to the Rev. Dr.
Washington Gladden, who. it lwas stated,
had said that all the troubles with regard
to John D.. Rockefeller had been settled.
It was the sense of the meeting _that
there would .. be no moro soliciting" *f or
m^ney where"' there- was any question re
garding its acciirritilation. ' t-
A programme committee, consisting of
Dr., George C. Adams, Rev.- L. P. Hitch
cock and , Rev." B. F. Sargent, . was ap
pointed. A committee: -on', membership,
consisting of Dr. Meserve, Rev. W. H.
Hopkins and Rev. C. R. Brown, was also
appointed. > ',- -

Young Pianist Will
Play Difficult
Composition:
Miss Joan, Baldwin Is the very young
pianist who a year ago was heard in a
recital here that called forth unstinted
praise from the musical critics. At the
next concert of the Mansfeldt Club, No
vember 16,. at Stelnway Hall, Miss
Baldwin will play, what many musi
cians consider Liszt's: greatest composi
tion for the piano, the B minor Ballade.
It is a work of great musical depth and
its technical difficulties are such as to
preclude its frequent appearance upon
concert "programmes. ) -
As to be .expected in a girl of Miss
Baldwin's talent, she has made great
strides since her last appearance, and
her. mature conception will find a beau
tiful outlet iii the numbers she will
play, next Thursday evening.

CHIEF GETS AUTOMOBILE
Health Board to Submit a
Plan for City to Undertake
Burial of Indigent Dead
.' \u0084:\u25a0 y â¢â¢â¢:\u25a0 i
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed -to print an ordinance declaring
Nineteenth avenue from Ocean avenue
to H street a public boulevard, along
and 'upon which" no railroad franchise
shall, ever be granted, and on which no
railroad tracks shall ever be laid.
This action will upset the plan of a
realty, company to petition for a fran
chise on Nineteenth avenue in order to
tap a tract of" land which Is being
opened up to homeseekers, to "which
The Call gave publicity last week.
"The avenue was first intended as a
public driveway." said Supervisor Con
nor, who introduced the .ordinance,
"and it should have been dedicated as
a boulevard long ago. The ordinance
will be a bar to the building of a street
car line on the avenue for all time."
The Finance Committee allowed the
claim of the Pioneer Automobile Com
pany in the sum of $2650 for an auto
mobile furnished the flre x department.
The committee had declined to pass the
bill at its' last meeting because the
demand was drawn on a fund allowed
for apparatus in which' an .automobile
was not included. Chief Engineer Sul
livan satisfactorily explained to the
committee that the new apparatus pur
chased had' not cost as much as cal
culated and there is enough left to
pay for the automobile.
The claim of Phllllp3 & Van Orden
for $486 50 for printing and binding
2000 copies of the* election laws fur
nished the Department of Elections
was also allowed. Supervisor Payot
said 4he price was outrageous, but he"
changed his mind after he was shown
a copy of the pamphlet.
The petition of the Santa Fe Rail
way Company for a spur track permit
on Fifteenth street, between Caroline
and De Haro. . was referred to the
Street Committee.
. drades were ordered changed at
points on Mission, Bauer, Tingley, Cot
ter, Cr"oke, Francis, Harrington, Nor
ton, Army. Mississippi, Texas, Con
necticut, Arkansas, 'Wisconsin. Caro
lina, De Haro, . Rhode Island, Vermont
streets and. San Bruno, Cortland. Ale
many, Union, Crescent and other ave
nues. â¢ .
At Lunstedt's suggestion an invita
tion was extended to the Supervisors
elect to attend the meetings in order
to familiarize themselves with their
prospective duties.
The board adopted- a resolution re
questing the Health Board to recom
mend a plan whereby the burial of the
indigent dead may be conducted entire
ly-under the control of the municipal
ity. In this plan the Health Board. is
requested to furnish a list of the em
ployes needed, the nature of \u25a0 their
work and the salaries recommended.
The board ordered the payment of
$2500 to C E. Grunsky fox services as
expert civil engineer in the suit of the
Spring Valley "Water Works against
the city to - test the' validity of the
water rates.*

A. McGowan, to dissolve their partner-?
ship . and for an accounting of the In
come of the firm as counsel for ex-
Public Administrator Farnham during
his incumbency from January, 1902, to
January. 1904.
Greene states in his complaint that
ho and McGowan have been unable to
agree as to which one a balance, if
any, is due, but asserts on informa
tion and belief that McGowan is in his
debt to the .extent of $300. He asks
that the court determine* whether or

SUPREME COURT DECLINES
TO CHANGE ITS JUDGMENT
Clark Will Decision, Which Indirectly
Benefits : Edna Wallace Hopper,
| Must Stand as a.' Precedent.
The Supreme" Court has refused to
change Its decision in the Clark will
contest. Aside- from the litigants . Im
mediately Interested, Edna Wallace
Hopper is affected more than any one
else In this Judgment. In the : Clark
case it was declared that a will writ
ten outside the State when the tes
tator resided in California must be pro
bated .under *;thl3 jurisdiction. The
most recent suit instituted by' the
diminutive actress was based on the
decision ' in the Clark case. \u25a0* The opin
ion handed down yesterday In response
to a petition for a rehearing, was an
affirmation r of ( the , Supreme Court's
judgment rendered a month ago.
" The Justices ' also decided yesterday
that Sacramento could not . maintain a
turnpike on the levee which runs"
across the land of iJantel McCarty near
the capital city. ,
The 'municipality, claims the right by
virtue of .; an ante-bellum \u25a0 act to hold
title to an easement for a 165-foo*t
levee \u25a0 on ' Mccarty's * land. He declares
âand his contentions have been sus
tained by the Supreme Court â that the
levee cannot be made more than -140
feet -.wide. .The â¢! Southern Pacific ;. Co
mpany i has a^track on 'the dike.- but no

according to, the Judgment.

THE COMING SESSION.
THE next is the long session of Congress, and if it be devoted
to the work that lies ahead it will need all of the months in
which' it may sit. The treasury income and .outgo must: .be
brought into better adjustment. This may.be done in- several ways.
One proposition is to authorize Panama bonds to an amount sufficient
to return to the treasury the $50,000,000 paid in the purchase and
the subvention to the republic of; Panama. -Another is to increase
internal revenue duties to bring the income far enough ahead of
the current outgo to leave a surplus that will cover that expenditure.
These are the firsU suggestions that issue from the situation, and
doubtless one of them will be adopted. - : :f *
The crux of the session is the railroad rate question, upon which
the President is insistent and which Congress cannot evade. It is
one of the greatest issues yet made in 'connection with the public
control of the policy of quasi-public corporations. There is a gen
eral feeling that it must be settled approximately. on the lines laid
down by the President, or its appalling alternative, government so
cialism, will leap at the throat of 'our system of government, and
there will be a combat in American politics compared with which the
slavery and silver questions will seem like child's play. Slavery
could have survived and free silver could have been adopted, and
the foundations of representative government would have remained.
But socialism proposes their destruction. Let no one fancy that it
is a failing fad. It is adolescent, growing, and its growth is pro
moted by some of the detestable features Jn the business life of the
country. Unless these can be abated by firm and wise exercise of the
functions of the system of government we have, the system itself
will be attacked on all sides.
Looking into the confused future, Californians are pleased and
confident. Their representation In Congress is fitted to the work
that lies close ahead. The Representatives and the junior Senator
have the mettle in them to do their part. In our senior Sehator,'Hon.
George C. Perkins, we fortunately have a combination of ability, ex
perience and industry, ranking with any in the Senate. His path has
passed through all the changes of fate and fortune, condition and
responsibility, that befall men. In public life his advance from the
State Legislature to the Governorship and thence to the Senate gave
him an extraordinary grasp of the requirements of such public trus
teeship and an acquaintance with his State and its people enjoyed by
but few Californians. To be in the Senate is a sacrifice. His work
is more exacting than he ever gave to his. private business, thrifty
as he has been. He knows the psychology of. public matters,
inner motives that orient men toward great issues, and so is equipped
to persuade and influence his fellows.
In the great work of the session he will be a factor of strength.
His experience in business and transportation peculiarly equip him
for judgment, and will cause his opinions to be received with credit
and profound respect. He has achieved in the Senate the same posi
tion he holds in\California politics, and all know that here no public
man in the State approaches him in influence and popularity.
It swells the pride of Californians to feel that, no matter how
great the issues nor how high tlfe debate, we are represented by men
capable of faking their full part in it all, This comes of wise selec
tion in the beginning, in part, and by keeping our men there when
their worth is proved. The State has wisely retained the services- of.
Senator Perkins until he has the acquaintance, the influence and the
weight that come in the Senate to proved ability. There is too
great a tendency in, American life to rotate members of Congress.
The office is an honor but, otherwise, viewed irom the standpoint of
personal interest, is no prize. When fit men can be found to take it,
they should be kept in service until they grow into. the high useful
ness that comes only with experience.
The people of the State wait calmly for the coming clash of in
terests in Washington, confident that their representatives will ac
quit themselves well.
TEED AT IT AGAIN.
SOME years ago Teed founded in san Francisco what he called
"The Koreshan Unity." As no one knew what that meant, it
had all the attractions* of mystery necessary to the foundation of
religious f ol-de-rol. ' He found followers and -professed to have the
power to have the human race look at its toes long enough to be
come uni-sexual and self-generative. He belongs to that class of
profound fakers who know that the more improbable, unlikely and
foolish the teaching, the more apt it is to find followers. Make mys
tery of nonsense, bawl "abracadabra," and look solemn, claim a su
pernatural power that exists only in the claim and is never exhibited,
and out of the mass of humanity will issue a stream of believers,
feathered geese, ready to be plucked.
Teed went from here to Chicago, and gathered geese feathers
enough to make him rich, and went to Florida, where he has set up
a templed establishment arid is still pushing his confidence game all
over the country. Attention is called to him now by a home in this
city broken up by his arts exercised upon a woman. There is talk
of appeal to the Federal authorities to suppress him. But for what
use? If he -do not break out in a new place another will. As long
as there is^rist of that kind there will be a mill of that kind. There
seems to be a fixed percentage of people who are ripe on both sides
for that sort of deception. It is useless to try to understand them.
It makes them happy to be fooled. If their eyes were ever open' it
is after they have been robbed materially and- morally, and even
then \u25a0 their fate does not deter oth ers.
: As long as there are suckers there will be fishermen. The news
papers expose these frauds, and publish broadcast the misery of
their awakened victims in vain. The procession of mystery and won
der seekers will not lose a single' fool. They will march right on
into the traps set by the crafty, the. sensual and the greedy. Intelli
gence and education have no effect in diminishing the number who
go marvel hunting. An appeal to the law is useless, except for the
restoration of goods in case of actual robbery. Character cannot be
recovered in'a lawsuit, and perhaps Is not worth it. . J ;l r
THE INFECTION-. OF DISORDER.
RUSSIAN disorder seems to spread like the grip, which is also
a Russian ailment From Tiflis to Helsingfors mobs - gnaw
a file and howl, murder, burn and steal, with an inhuman
abandon not equaled before in the history. ;bf:Â« man. The Chinese
mob at Lienchau showed itself a dose second to the Russian mob
in the massacre of the American missionary party. The account
of that outrage recalls the lurid- history of the Ri^ssian advance
from the Amur River to Peking in the Boxer war f when the Chinese
suffered unspeakable outrage at the hands of the Cossacks. The sore
suggestion is that missionaries should christianize Christendom so
that its armies will not- provoke such horrid reprisals.
Like sparks flying from a burning building the .mob ; tinder
jumps continents , and oceans. American warships 'are Wacihg; to
put out a fire it has started in Santo Domingo, and Brazil has caught
the infection and is in an uproar. It ,ls a; dry and, explosive time.
Even in our own sober-minded country the people, are in an effer
vescent mood and inclined to raise, violent hands against every
thing .that is. The nations: near "to Russia feel the strain of infec
tion and many rulers are roosting uneasily on z powder keg, hoping
that it won't blow up and fearing that it will. \ : .J_ */. â¢"
It is a good time for people everywhere ; to keep rtheir.hcsfds cool

\u25a0 ; "Hem! hah! cr â yes; I see"; -.;..
Then, as he felt of uncle's pulse, "It's
very clear to me '
Pernicious microbes here 'are found."

The riext physician we called in was ge
nial as could be. \
But still, he says with bated breath,
"Bacteria here, I see."
Then uncle gave a dretful groan, and
says, "Alas! alas!'.
Although I ain't prepared fer It, I see
that I must pass."
We called : one doctor more, and he was
graver than the rest.
And took a kind of dinner horn to hear In
uncle's .breast, *\u25a0
And then he shook his head and says
"Schlzomycetes here!"
"Alas!" "says uncle, "I am called, and
now the summons hear." _\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'.
Just three days later uncle drew his latest,
fieetin' breath,' \u0084
And I Have always some supposed that
he was scairt to death; .
But in his dyin' hour he called my pa
unto his bed.
"Jest .raise \u25a0' a tombstun o'er me, SI," in
broken words he said, ,'
"And on it carve a epitaph, a simple one,
you know:
'One Joseph Potter lieth here, free from
all earthly woe.
He lived to sixty-seven years, and hopes
of heaven was his.

FABL.K OF THE GOOD WOMAN.
The* soul of a woman who had agreed
with President Roosevelt in his views of
race suicide, and who consequently had
had nine children, whom she had cared
for tenderly and lovingly, keeping: house
for them and her -husband, . doing the
cooking and the mending. urid the wash
ing and a thousand other needful thingsâ
the soul of this poor I woman sought the
great, pearly gate and asked for admis
sion.
"ComÂ© right in.", said, the pitiful angel
at the ' gateT "It. Is. recorded that you
need rest, and here you shall find it."
So the soul of the good, woman entered
Into the beautiful city. ! ' ' *
But after about a rbpnthâ as time is
recorded on the earth-^the soul of the
good woman again* approached the angel
at the gate, hesitating as If It had some
what to say, but feared to say it.
"What is it?" the kind angel asked.
"Speak, saintly one; Ido not be afraid to
express thy thought." ~
So the soul of the woman took courage
and she spoke:
"Is it permitted that we who are in this
abode of the blest may sometimes . visit
the earth again?" \u25a0
"It is somewhat against the rules, but
well, what do you want?"
"Some way, I, cannot feel -that it Is
right to rest so much when Iâ when I am
sure that my children are needing me.
Let me return to earth again for but a
little while."
But the angel's answer, lo!.it is not re
corded. '
Moralâ lt is hard to believe that some
mothers "will be quite content/even in
heaven until their children come. \u25a0\u25a0

HEREDITARY POETS OF INDIA
WILL BOMBARD THEIR ROYAL
VISITORS WITH ODES GALORE
THE visit of the Prince and Princess
of . "Wales to Indla^ will /give ' the
\u25a0 natives unique chances "of . proving
their loyalty; for the unofficial programme
includes ' the composing of- many.- poems.
Few 'of them â¢ will be presented to their
Royal > Highnesses, but as- it take's more
than-- the ;. usual .number '-'of rebuffs to
dampen the. ardor of the Hindu; man of
letters, there is little ;doubt ; that the
dusky ' bulbuls ;. will unceasingly v chant
their songs 'of ' praise" In the privacy ; of
the j home circle, . and if the : Prince, whose
courtesy and tact are only equaled by his
exceeding urbanity, accepts i one in. every
.hundred -of "these remarkable 'odes,' his
memory will lons- be enshrined, in the
hearty ., of , the'. Eastern people,, says the
London .Mail." ' \u0084 .
The'riative aspirant does not follow the
methods employed by our latter-day Eng
lish poets; The art , of > scanning Is un
known to 'him ; he wots not of "hexameters
and other, . vexatious -hindrances which
are.: calculated. to check the. flow of soul.
Provided the last word in each line
rhymes, he does not concern himself with
other details. Â»
;.\u25a0;. With v the' aid of a dictionary, the Bible,
and j a ShakesDearc, -he bends himself to
the task, "and if he runs short of words in
one line he makes up for short weight in
another. â¢ -
ItÂ«Â«may be added that each poem of
welcome will <y)mmence ( with an "O,"
and that as . time is no object to a B. A.
of Calcutta University, his v worst enemy
will have no excuse .to accuse him Â« of
skimping his work. Should the sinews
of "war fail him. he, of course, has no '
alternative but to end his poem abruptly
âunless some public-spirited friend steps
Into the breach with a supply of paper.
When ' the Duke of Connaught visited
the Delhi Durbar the local poets were
busily employed in writing sonnets in
his honor. One of these effusions Is as
follows:
"O Arthur bright
. ..You true knight,
\u25a0;â¢ "\u25a0 'To come o'er great seas.
Your children, please,
InTus behold
- With. more than gold
In the, shape of a hearty welcome.
We will ring the bell. Come
And Join in toast.
It is our very proud boast
That you will be here again
In spite of all wind and rain."
; All epics,\ odes, triolets, quatrains and
other descriptions of poems written in
praise of "the royal visitors will be
couched in the same extraordinary strain,
and many of them are certain to com
mence: â¢
V : "O King!"
being followed by "Your son's the thing,"
"The bells must ringr," or "To thee we
cling." The Princess, too, will inspire
versesâ though not in the gentle breasts
of Zenana women for India does not
produce lady poets.,
â¢ Doubtless as soon as the vessel touches
af Bombay, some , enterprising gentleman'
poet will make a bid for the crown of
bays by dashing into verse.

should one of their number break away
from custom and become a coal heaver or
a carpenter, his days are numbered so

, Consequently each hamlet , has its
balladmonger, and it Â£is his . business
to provide a suitable poem for , every

WHAT A DIFFERENCE
A Change Id Food Makes.
All these things come from lack of
the right elements in the food. A
I'rofessor says:
"Some years ago while teaching in
Canada, 1 began to run down . and a
daily headache and nervousness dis-
tressed mÂ«, then my eyes became affect-
ed and pained me grrcatlj-. There were
days when it seemed the top of 'my
head would lift off and the pain drive
me crazy.
"I Rave up work In Winnipeg and
SÂ«t a graduate scholarship at Cornell ,
University. But after being- there four
months I broke dow"n completely, with
tye trouble, stomach trouble and head
trouble. For S months I was unable to
resume my work â for one entire
month I was kept in a darkened room.
"1 came back to Canada and began
teaching again, struggling against contin-
ued bad health. The doctors said my
troubles came from my nerves, the oc-
ulists said from my eyes. I read every-
thing on the subject I could get hold
cf. In a. famous work on 'Neuras-
thenia', one sentence struck be partic-
ularly: 'Diet alone, without medicine,
will flo more good than all the medicine
iik ihe world without diet.'
"i have demonstrated most thor-
oughly and completely the truth of
that declaration.
"From trying different foods I stum-
bled on Grape-Kuts. as a forlorn hope,
a few months agrp. When I began Its
use I weighed l'lS pounds and after
using It a short time found my weight
increased to 125 pounds. It is not my
nature to be very heavy, so the gain
was remarkable.
"However, that was only one and tho
smallest of the benefits I derived from
Grape-Nuts. Before I begun to use' lt
I could not concentrate my mind on
my work; In school 1 was so nervous
I could scarcely stand before my pu-
pils.
"Now my head is absolutely free
from aches -and: pains; I never have
any more trouble with my stomach and
xny eyes; my nerves are restored, and
my roent&l powers are active and vig-
orous, in fact my friends say I am a
transformed man.
"I feel that it'le to the use of Grape-
JCuts food alone that I owe my restora-
tion to health and that by, its use I
can keep. myself in perfect mental and
physical condition. I sometimes leave
it out of myÂ«bill of fare for a week
or two only to return to it again and
feel the same Improvement Immedlate-
"l- refer you to any of the school and
University authorities In Winnipeg,
where I was classical master in the
Collegiate Institute for Z years, as /well
fcR to Professor Bennett, head profes-
sor in Latin at Cornell University.
"I have simply stated plain facts,
end unhesitatingly declare that I
would rather die than again go
through the tortures and miseries from
.which Grape-Nuts delivered me." Name

ARMY OFFICER
QUITS SERVICE
President Accepts Eesigna
tion of Lieutenant Frank
S. Burr, Who Avoids Trial
UNWISELY CONVIVIAL
Accumulated Debts and Fail
ure to Appear for Examin
ation Bring- Him Trouble
Lieutenant Frank S. Burr is no longer
an officer of the United States army. The
President has accepted his resignation
for the good of the service.
Burr was what Is generally known as a
"good follow." He was, however, too
good a fellow for the salary that Uncle
Sam paid him. He spent his money free
ly, and when hÂ« was through with that
he went Into debt for more. In fact, it
Is reported that he owes. large sums at
every post at which he has been- sta
tioned since he went into the service.
This, coupled with the fact that last
month, when he' was to be up for his ex
amination for promotion to a captaincy,
he failed to put In an appearance, led to
hia BÂ«vering connection with the service.
At the time Burr was to come up for
his examination he was In the Fifteenth
Infantry, stationed . at the Presidio of
Monterey. That regiment sailed for Ma
nila on the transport Sherman on No
vember 8, but as Burr was under arrest
at that time he was left behind? As a
court-martial stared him in the face, he
decided to send In his resignation.'
Before he went Into the army Burr was
a minstrel. He had a fine voice and made
a great hit with all the different compa
nies he appeared In. He was well known
In minstrelsy circles throughout the East
ern States. During his early career ; In
the army he was a brave soldier, but
conviviality spoiled his prospects.
Burr entered the army as a private in
Company M of the Second Nebraska In
fantry on May 12, ISSB. He was appointed
a second lieutenant of the Third Infantry,
United States regulars, July 9, .1898. On
May 25, ISSB. he was promoted to first
lieutenant of the Eleventh Infantry, and
on August 7, 1900, was transferred to the
Fifteenth Infantry.
A new schedule has been Issued by
the War Department for the sailing of
troops to and from Manila, to take ef
fect immediately. According to the
new schedule troops will sail from San
Francisco as follows: Headquarters
and ten troops of the Third Cav
alry, December 15; four troops of the
Fourth! Cavalry, January 5; Twenty
fourth Infantry, January 25; Eighth
Infantry and two troops of the Third
Cavalry, March 5.
Troops leaving the Philippines will
sail as follows: Seventh Infantry, No
vember 15; Twenty-second infantry,
December 15; Second Cavalry, Janu
ary 25; TwenUeth Infantry, March 5;
and the Twelmi Infantry, April 16.
The officers at the Presidio are Inves
tigating: the story of Private Harris ox
the Tenth Company of Coast Artillery,
who claims that he was held up near
the Presidio Sunday evening. ' Harris
claims that he was returning from
Harbor View late Sunday .evening
when, two men, supposed to be : soldiers,-,
stepped from a dark corner and com
manded him to hold up his hands. The
two men : then went thrqjigh his ;
pockets, but did not get anything. \u25a0,

MARGARET LANGHAM GIVES
HINT OF GREATNESS.

of Remarkable
'\ Debut
HAS HUMOR
AND POISE
Her Lady Babbie
v Proves "Clever
Portrayal ;v; v
Bernhardts before ; nowâ that is, before
last night at the Alcazarâ have been
used as stop-gaps. "The Bernhardt, in
fact, that way begins as a : rule. -." Mies
Margaret Langham, who last night ap
peared as Lady Babble In â¢'The Little
Minister," may \ not be a Bernhardt, but
she is certainly a stop-gap. Just what?
else Miss ,Langham " may. be is of the
interesting 1 Questions of the week. The
data up to date are that siie is a young
woman of fortunate descent, her, mother,
Mrs. Huddlestcn, a distinguished literary
critic, herself with experience with Julia
Marlowe and Annie Russell ; with Frank
Keenan at the Berkeley Lyceum in New
York, in "queer" plays in which Miss
Langham was noted for her correspond
ent "queerness"; and most lately in stock
at the Belasco Theater in Los Angeles.
And Miss Langham may be twenty-one.
She comes, as before said, to nil in be
tween two leading ladies, Miss Moore of
last week. Miss Evelyn of next.
Those with a prophetic turn will enjoy
wasting some of it upon Miss Langham.
Down. at the Belasco Theater they have
not yet classified her. J All kinds of roles
she plays arid is still without a label.
"Ingenue" is unfit, aftex. her
work of last night, and what particular
and peculiar thing the young woman may
do is yet an unknown quantity. \u25a0 One
thihg, she will do something. It was her
debut last night as Lady. Babbie, her first
big role, and Miss Langham achieved a
really notable success. ;
Young, unripe as the work was felt to
be in places, of its promise there is no
doubt. Of course. Miss Langham's Lady
Babbie is not * Maude - Adams', but as a
debut performance it can be classed only
as remarkable. Nor only In the first act
was It evident that it was* a debut per
formance. A tall, slim slip of a girl,
gypsy-black of eyes and hair, with a pe
culiarly mobile face. Miss Langham
brings much to the. picture. And she has
humor, she has poiae, she has tempera
ment. She succeeded in getting into the
character some of that elfish witchery
that was its chief grace in Maude Ad
ams' hands; much also of the delightful
willfulness; something also of the deeps
underlying Babbie's surface mischief.
Altogether it- is a characteristic and indi
vidual performance, from which all sorts
of go}>d things may be inferred. Her
audience took Miss Langham to Its heart
at once.
Mr. Waldron can act better things than
his*. little minister. 'it'lacte/mHKeiaflflmie
simplicity, the sweetness,'- the- ""adorable
lack of humor' of " Mr.. Dishart. He' is
rather a sophisticated person,' Mr. Wal
dron's Dishart, played with the thought
of a wink at the audience. The group of
elders is well. played, -Mr. Butler. has Rob
Dow; Nera Ross Is clever, as usual, as
Nannie Webster, Henry D. Byers useful
as Rintoul tund Robert Homans very ef
fective as Captain Halliwell. Nor to be
forgotten Is' Leonora Irwln's sprightly
French maid.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Oalral.
Herschel Mayall. the popular and
handsome leading man at the Central
Theater, forgot his good looks last
night when he played In the big pro
duction' of Lincoln J. Carter's noted
melodrama, "The Darkest Hour." As
a verdant German, youth, fresh from
the "fatherland," Mayall made one of
the biggest hits he has ever scored at
the Central. He was the typical Ger
man, brimming over with fun, and the
applause, he was given'by a large au
dience was testimony of the artistic
merit of his acting. "The : Darkest
Hour" provided good material for every
member of the Central's company and
a clever story of ; the struggle between
vice and virtue was cleverly /told.
Edna* Ellsmere, Henry Shumer. James
Corrigan; Clare Sinclare, George P.
Webster, True Boardman, Lilian Elliott
and others all helped in the success
of the melodrama. One mechanical
scene showing a full-sited train : disap
pearing in the distance down , a long
stretch of railroad track and the
blowing, up Of a. trestle bridge was
realistically presented and was one of
the big' features of an entirely suc
cessful presentation. Next week -the
Central will present "Sapho". for; the
final week, of Belasco & Mayer's man
agement at the theater, the entire
company , opening on ;November 27: at
the Alhambra Theater, .which the- Be
lasco firm has leased indefinitely.

The Tiger Lilies attracted a . large
audience to the California Theater last

ing piece was "A Temporary Husband,'.'
which was followed byr specialties jby

CLEVER' 1 SAX FRANCISCO PLAY
WRIGHT WHOSE PLAY. "THE
LIGHT ETERNAL.'-' IS SUCCESS.
The Majestic.
..Martin Merle's drama of early, Chris
tianity. "The Light - Eternal,", enters
upon its second week at the Majestic
Theater and continues a big drawing
card. V.,VV.--V
"The Light Eternal," 'which has made
a hit at the Majestic, Is the product of
a young San Francisco playwright,
Martin V. Merle. The play was first
written for a college entertainment at
Santa Clara, where it : was portrayed
entirely by the student body. Later,;af
ter .receiving unstinted praise ffom
critics, Mr. Merle decided to rewrite the
play for. the professional stage, intro
ducing the Roman characters and
weaving a romance about the. ancient
Roman. Christianity.. /
The idea of the play came from an
absorbing study of Roman history by
the playwright while at; college. The
reign of the lenient Diocletian;
swayed by his evil advisers, appealed
to. the imagination of .the young man.
The result is a product that has
made the hit of the year at the Ma
jestic.
Alartin V. Merle was born in San
Francisco some twenty-five years ago.
Accustomed from his youth to" the re
finement of a, happy home' life," his cre
ative and imaginative faculties'devel
oped.early and found outlet in the con
struction, of miniature playhouses* and
the .enacting of classic proles with hi 3
boy companions.. ... :
After graduating from St.- Ignatius
and the Polytechnic High School the
young- man decided that a histrionic
career would give best opportunity. for
his -talents, and" he -.engaged with
Frederick Warde. ; With \u25a0 Ward the
young actor â¢ received :. a :\u25a0 thorough
coaching in '-\u25a0 the V legitimate, ' and \u25a0\u25a0 much
of what' he learned; with the veteran
stood him well in the creation and
staging of "The Light Eternal." After
some time with Warde, with whom he
played several important* parts, notably
Marco 'in "The Lion/s Mouth," Merle
left for the East.
He was immediately -engaged by
Charles Frohriian in support of Maude
Adams In; "At ithe. Telephone" and
"Many a Slip,", but sickness com
pelled him to resign his position and he
returned to' his home.' Upon' regain
ing his health "Merle decided to enter
Santa Clara Colleg-e,";and: it Was there
that his present Was conceived
and written. >
The first production took place at the
college,.; the students playing the
women's parts. Again 1 the performance
was repeated "and favorably received
atthe Alhambra in the city and bythe
Santa Clara students. Later Mr; Merle
revised the' play," and it came forthln
Its present, shape as seen at the Ma
jestic. \u25a0 ' - r -
Besides; writing "The Light Eternal"
Merle wrote a short sketch . called "A
Prairio Judgment." .which was pro
duced under his '{direction by the pu
pils of {.the. Gerson; School of Acting at
thej Alcazar a year and a half ago.
Mr. -Merle is the 'editor-in-chief of the
Santa Clara College : paper, The Red
wood, In which from time to\ time short
stories by. hlni appear. : He also at
tained '; fame ,for -staging, the T '.'Passion
Play" of Clay M.'Greene atthe college.
The; playwright; has the admiration and
affection of. hosts of friends at the col- ;
lege and was presented by them .with a

Â»w York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK. Xov. 13. â Our < cotton market
opened weak. Ul to -o points . . .Iflwi*. There
was heavy liquidation, bat *>n . tha decline thÂ«
baying. was ci a. good character. .Cables from
Liverpool claim -there was heavy- liquidation
in that market at all paints. ' Telegrams from
promise::! r-wr'iJ S^P&ll confirm the Jdea of a
small crop. The Isoathera Cotton 'Growers'
Association will call a meeting In the next
few days to advise planters to hold for 13c
a , f-ocnJ. Tfc.l* reaction is no more : than
natural. ' HtStS&^^aSSVÃqSffmÃma&tX
To-day's market was ; somewhat of a sen
sational character, 'for? very, few In .the trade
hadr thought *: U>,Â» \u25a0. speculative position of the
market- lajt weelc was : of-: each, a -.weak . char
acter that s uch ;a - sharp - decline could have
occurred as took, place, to-day. \u25a0;*.*. ;..'-:
The Liverpool market did not respond to the
movement \of Saturday.. The market - there
broke widÂ» open and dosed with a net decline
of 13 to 15 : poiati. ThÂ« market. . however,
ought to have some rally on general principles
after so much ~ liquidation ' and â¢ such a sharp
decline of 50 points within the last few days.
The immediate future course or prices, h*w
evsr will depend whether th*s spinners araln
buy ' as freely as" in * the recent '\u25ba past. Ulti
mately prices might be > higher* than \u25a0 hu yet
been rÂ«Â»ehe<J. â¢ Â«yea if the : crap sboald be over
lu.ooo 000 bates, as the statistical position tn
the sprlcs will be very strong. For the present
it is largely a trader's . market. . and \u25a0 operators
expect to ccc * con tir.uar.ee of erratic Cue tui
tions
Dick sajrs: 'There has. been a lot of prbfit
taking b>" shorts, which gives * the market
strength and bas caused a rally of 10 points;
but tbe shorts \u25a0 being covered leaves the - mar
ket In a very . vulnerable position and as â¢ the
increased crop estimate : any * attepjpt ito ash
cotton mlfbt cause much lower prices.''

lower to He higher at SMlc to fcS^c Outside
newg generally *as favorable to a decline and
as a eon secuence : there was free eellmjc by
commission houses and pit - traders. Weekly
statistics furnished a portion of the selling
incentive. World's shipments were large, and
the airujunt of bnaidituffs on : passage show
an Increase of 2,uMJ,Â«XO bushels ' for the week."
The domestic situation gave, additional encoar
aserrent ta the be2r*. Receipts. of wteat UÂ»
the"* Northwest were liberal and the weathÂ«r
throughout the spring -wheat -territory was
Ifevorable for the movement of the new crop.
Selllrz, however, was temporarily checked by
a cablegram from Argentina claiming that
the w*Â»*at cror> there was damaged by cold,
wet weather. On buying orders created by this
dispatch the price of the May option touched
5S%c soon after th? . opening. Shortly . after
waird tfcere was a sharo break and the price
of ilay dropped to S7Â»Â»c The decline was ac
companied by increasine- eelllnx- on the I part
of the cornmi*siÂ«rÂ»TÂ»ou*ss and pU traders The
high prices for call money on Wall street were
eald to be the prlncfpal cause of renewed sell
ing pressure. . During thÂ« last-haJf-hcur cov

market also received moderate support from a

ANDREWS' WIFE
WANTS JEWELS
Declares That the Diamonds
Found on Dead Murderer
Were Stolen From .Her
MAKES COUNTER CLAI3I
William G! Ellis. Victim of
Remarkable Criminal, De
mands Share of Property
Now- that Milton Franklin Andrews, the
most remarkable crook of a decade, is
beneath the sod, a squabble â¢will probably
result over the possession of the property
he left behind. Through the City Marshal
of Holyoke. Mass., Andrews' wife has
put In a claim for the property. William
C. Ellis, the man who was nearly mur
dereiM>y Andrews and his female accom
plice. Nulda Petrie, declares that he is
entitled to 411 that the dead criminal left
behind
Tin* property found in the. Berkeley
house, where the attempt was made to
murder Ellis, ?s valued at $1200.- This -is
in the possession of the Public Adminis
trator of AUimeda County. The jewels
found in the McAllister street flat, where
And'.cws. driven to a corner. 1 killed his
companion and himself, are in the;posseÃ
Â»ion of Public Administrator ;M. J.
Hyncs of this city. He declares that he
will turn them over to the Public Admin
istrator of Alamcda. County upon demand.
The jewels are valued at about $654.
The fOiiovrins letter was received by
Chief cf Police Dinan yesterday:
HOLYOKE, Mass.. Nov. f. 1908
Cti'l of Pollc. San Francisco, Cal.
I;oar Sir: I see by our papers that a roan
bj ?h* name of Milton F. Andrews ehot and
killed himself in your city November <;. His
Wife and child live here and arc anxious to
lesin ihe sÂ«ArticularÂ» as well as If he left any
property. Jf Â«o It certainly belongs to his
Wit>. \.
\u25a0JT.is man Andrews stoV from his wife some
incnf) 1 and diamond? when he was -in Battle
Creek. Mich. One was a three and a half
learnt uianiond ring, one a turquoise; ring, with
fourth n small diamonds around stone, one solid
goiC chain gn.l lons links, on* valuablediamond
Â«rsrf iwn. He also had her trunk with some
or her clothes in It. She Is in moderate cir
eumftanrw and if there is any property It cer
ta!niy u-;.-:cs to his wife and child. If I am
not askinp toil much plt-ase send me a detailed
account of what he had. lam writing- this at
Wrs. Andrews" request. Any information you
car. Five will be appreciated by her as well as
this department. Your respectfully,
3. S. WRIGHT. City Marshal.
The following Is the list of the jewelry
new in the possession of Public Admin
istrator Hynes: One plain gold ring, $2 50;
yellow metal ring, fourteen diamonds,
ilOO; one solitaire ring, $500; one gold
chain. $14; one Eagle badge, $2 50, and
onp yellow metal watch, $35.
From the letter received from Marshal
\u25a0Wright of HoSyoke it would seem that
th<> most valuable pieces of jewelry left
by tho dead crook, the solitaire ring, the
fourteen-diamond ring and the chain,
belonged to his wife. Immediately upon
l he receipt of the Marshal's letter Chief
Dinan sent Detective Bunner to Public
Administrator Hynes. who declared that
hf could turn over the property to no one
but ihe Public Administrator of Alameda
County.
Ellis has already engaged an attorney
to fight for his share of Andrews' "es
tate."
OAKLAND. Nov. 13.â Attorney John de
Lam-ey, counsel for Public Administrator
George Gray of Alameda County, said to
right that a demand for the property of
Andrews would probably be made to
morrow. Mr. De Laneey said: "As yet
we have taken no action whatever in re
gard to the property left by Andrews,
either In Berkeley of San Francisco. I
have an appointment with Judge Edgar
of Berkeley at 9:30 to-morrow morning,
and as soon as I have seen him I shall
take possession of the property left In
Berkeley and shall also make a demand
oti Public Administrator Hynes of San
Francisco for the property left in that
city."
Kllis. who was nearly murdered by An
drews In Berkeley, has assigned all his
Interest in the property left in that city
In payment of his hospital fees, and It Is
probable that he will institute proceed
ings to secure a shxre of the property
left by Andrews in San Francisco.

CRUNSKY TALKS
ABOUT WATER
On the Witness Stand- He
Swears That Spring Valley
Trod net Is Unwholesome
SIERRAS BEST SOURCE
Civil Engineer Gives His
Reasons for His Advocacy
of Municipal Ownership
Expert Civil Engineer C.' E. Grunsky
spoke - strongly yesterday afternoon in
United States Commissioner Heacock's
courtroom In favor of municipal owner
ship and control of water works. He
presented the following figures to show
that municipal ownership was becoming
popular. In the year ISOO, he said, the
ratio of municipalities owning and oper
ating their own water supply was 6 3-10
per cent; in 1S20; 16 6-10 per cent; in IS4O,
35 9-10: in IS6O. 42; in 1880, 49, and in 1896,
53 2-10 per ceuu
In response to questions by Assistant
City/Attorney John S. Partridge the wit
ness* questioned the purity of the water
supplied to the inhabitants of this city
by- the Spring Valley Water Company,
and produced a boxful of jars containing
water said to have been taken from the
Tuolumne River, I>ake Eleanor and Lake
Merced. That from Lake Merced con
tained much organic matter floating in it.
That from the Tuolumne River and Lake
Eleanor was as clear as though It had
been distilled.
To speaking of the Spring Valley sys
tem the witness said: "Water from such
sources should be subjected to filtration.
It cannot be hoped to obtain water of the
same high standard of excellence as
would he obtained from such high moun
tain regions as those of the Sierra Neva
da. It is the experience throughout the
world that when water of a high standard
of excellence is substituted for water of
doubtful purity- the prevalence of certain
diseases is materially reduced. This is
notably true of typhoid fever, and. the
typhoid fever death rate is often referred
to in determining whether or not the mu
nicipality is receiving first-class water.
Where pure water is furnished the death
rate from typhoid fever should be -less
than ten ocr each 100,000 of population.
The cities which have death rates less
than ten per 100.000 inhabitants' ara in al
most every case those which use water
from mountain sources 'or those which
have well-managed filtering plants.
"I favor municipal ownership, especial
ly in California, where the privilege to
open streets to lay mains for^supplylnjj
water for domestic use is a constitutional
privilege. The selection of a source of
supply can usually be made with greater
care by a municipality than by a private
company, and the public heaith will be
better safeguarded. ,The interest required
will be lower, as well as the charges for
the use oi water."
The witness repeated his former esti
mate of $26,173,212 as the value- of tlie
property of the Spring Valley Water
Company used in supplying the inhabit
ants of this city. He did not believe,
however, that f2.500.000 should be included
for the franchise. He valued In* fact
that it was an established business at
$1,400,000. but he could not find any basis
for a franchise value. Depreciation In
value arising from deterioration of the
plant should be taken into account. Es
timating the life of a water works plant
at forty years, 1 3-10 per cent of the capi
tal invested should be returned to the
company annually in order that the sums
thus paid at 3 per cent interest will, at
the end of the forty years, operate to en
able the water company to reproduce the
works.

. "This beats all!" exclaimed Judge Mo
gan when v lx>u!s U Matta had concluded
narrating the cause of the | quarrel | be
tween himself and another man in a res
taurant at Market and Eleventh Â»treets. :
"It must be true," said Patrolman Me
Grath, the complaining witness, "for the
restaurant man;. told me the very same
story." "5V
: "Well, well, well," rejoined the bench,
"it's the most extraordinary thing I ever
heard of. Restaurant rumpuses are usu
ally evolved" by unwillingness or inability
to I pay for food ordered and j eaten, yet
this defendant's eagerness to pay was the
cause of his undoing. The case is unpre
cedented in this court."
The tale that provoked his Honor's
wonderment, if not incredulity, was the
fact that Mr. Matta and a friend of his
dined .together in the caravansary afore
mentioned. When the repast was finished
Mr. Matta instructed the waiter to give
him the bill for both meals, but the other
man requested that he be allowed the
privilege of settling the account^ Mr.
Matta said he couldn't think of , permit
ting such a thing, and the other man
made similar declaration, and then each
of them sternly commanded the waiter
to al.fctain from taking any money from
the other. â¢
"It's my treat," Mr. Matta asserted,
'â¢'and j you shall not . pay for it and make
me: ashamed to look at my face reflected
in aâ¢; mirror."
"It. was my suggestion that we eat,"
warmly, retorted the other man,' "and if
you ; think I'm such a cur as to let you
pay for the grub you must be a cur,"
"If you weren't a cur you wouldn'tâ"

FAVORITISM
AND LAXITY
UNCOVERED
Grand Jury's Expert Finds
Evidence of Unfair Dis
crimination in Records
of the Board of Works
SIDE SEWER COST
GREATLY VARIES
Accountant Young Calls At
tention to Various 'Ap
parent Slack Methods of
Handling ; City's Business
Evidence of gross favoritism in the op
erations of departments of ,the .Board of
Public Works have been disclosed to the
Grand Jury "by a report filed yesterday
with that body, by Douglas Young,; the
expert accountant. ' Young had. been for
a month engaged In Investigating the
Board of Public Works under direction
of the Grand Jury. His report, a volu
minous document, gives the result of his
inquiry, i
Every department's accounts and meth
ods of conducting the city's business were
closely scrutinized. While . no direct
charges of theft or fraud are made to the
Grand Jury, data in much detail has been
supplied as bases for investigation of the
board if | the Grand Jury shall decide to
probe more deeply Into the department
affairs.
The expert's report Indicates that John
Foppiana, superintendent of the side sew
er department, has been not only lax^but
has permitted favored citizens to procure
work done by municipal employes at
much less rates than have been paid by
property owners who are not on the in
side.
EXPERT SHOWS LAXITY.
Under ... the law a property owner who
desires to connect his premises with a
main sewer must' deposit with the "side
sewer" department a sum estimated to be
sufficient I to cover the cost of Inspection,
hauling, street paving, labor and the like
in connection with the excavation of the
trench. After the work is completed the
property owner, tif there be a balance on
his deposit over the cost, recovers it by
the' lssuance of a demand on the depart
ment in his favor. On the other hand,
any amount due on the cost of the work
above his deposit is, under the law, a
standing Hen against .his property until
paid.
Records of the department, according to
Expert Young's report, show wide dis
crepancies in the sums paid by various
citizens . for identically the same amount
of work. These differences point to a
slackness in the handling of the business,
and, as the report flatly declares, to an
unfair, system..
'In other .departments of the Board of
Public Works, laxity is charged In , the
method of handling permits for street
work.,; This Is : presented by means .of
elaborate schedules drawn from : the rec
ords in the various departments.
The expert has given considerable at
tention to the matter of theater licenses
and to the apparent discrimination shown
by municipal ; employes in' favor of play
houses and their payments of municipal
fees. The Grand Jury's attention â¢is di
rected to this subject, which Is elaborated
by the production of comparative state
ments drawn from the official records.

playground under the bond issue as an
alternative site to block 129,
bounded by Powell, Stockton, Filbert
and Greenwich streets, and also re
questing: the City Attorney to solicit
offers from the owners for the sale of

mains the choice of the board for the
playground.'

visit a proposed location of a lot on
which to construct a pumping station
in connection- with a sewer to be built
in Mission. street from Second to East

Death Ends Litigation.
" Death has ended the suit instituted
by Howard W. Lawlor, a printer,
against the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company for $30,000
damages for personal injuries. On the
night of May 21, 1903, Lawlor went to
his home at 2031 Howard street, and
as he entered his room he struck a
match, intending to light the gas Jet.
Just as he lit the match, however, there
was an explosion and he was terribly
burned.. Alleging that the gas which
caused. the explosion leaked from pipes
put In place by the gas company, Law
lor sued for damages. The case was
to have gone to trial yesterday, but
when it was called Campbell, Metson
& Campbell, representing the plaintiff,
announced that , their client had died
from his injuries and asked that the
case be dropped from the calendar. It
was so ordered. \u25a0
June 1, 1906, is only seven months

WONDERFUL CURE BY
CUTICURA REMEDIES
â¢
â¢!My little son, a boy of firÂ©, brokÂ«
out with aa itching rash. Three doo*
tore prescribed for him, but he kept
. getting worse until we could not dress
him any more. They finally advised
me' to try a certain medical College,
but its treatment did no good. At thÂ«
time I was induced to try Cuticur*
he was so bad that I had to cut his-
hair off and put the Cuticura Ointme&l^
on him on bandages, as it was impos-
sible to touch h\m with tho bare hand.
There was not one square inch of ajdn
on his whole body that was not affected.
He was one mass of sores. The band-
ages used to stick to his skin and in
removing them it used to take the skin
off with them, and the screams from
. the poor child were heart-breaking. I
began to think that he would never get
well, but after the second application
of Cuticura Ointment I began to sea
eigps of improvement, ana with tho
third and fourth applications the sores
commenced to dry up. His skin peeled
off twenty times, but it finally yielded
to the treatment. Now I can say that
he is entirely cured, and a stronger and
healthier boy you never saw than he is
to-day. Robert Wattam, 4922 Cente*

Baldness Due to a 1.1 vine .Minute Germ.
Many , people, even unto the present
day of grace, consider baldness due to
hereditary influence.
Nothing is further from tho truth-
Baldness is caused by the onslaught of
a minute organism which secretes it-
self beneath the scalp and attacks tha
roots of the hair â causing it to lose its
life and fall out.
This organism cannot be got rid of
except -by the free and perse verms use
of Newbro's Herpicide.
No matter how badly the scalp is af-
fected the Dandruff surely disappears
and hair health is restored when Her-
picide is applied. s
