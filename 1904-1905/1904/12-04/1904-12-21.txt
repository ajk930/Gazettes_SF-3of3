BOSTON, Dec. 20. â Thomas
W. Lawson said to-night that
he had beÂ«i poisoned twice In
the last Uirec weeks. He made
light of it, but Insisted that
Uiere was no mistake. He had
reasons of his own for keep
ins the story from the public,
he said.
"In about twenty days." he
said, "I have been suddenly
and mysteriously stricken down
twice. Once doctors worked
o\-er me for twenty- four hours
before they pronounced my life
to be out of danger. In both
cases the symptoms were those
of acute digestive pains, nausea
and other signs that usually ac- *
company poisoning.**
NET.' YORK, Dec. 20.â While Every
body's Magazine, containing Thomas
W. Lav.fon's story of "Frenzied
Finance," was being circulated by the
hundred thousand to-day~tn-^defiance
of the earning given by samuel Unter
myer Jr., counsel for Henry H. Rogers,
Untermyer himself was In Boston.
where it was correctly supposed he
was taking action against the sensa
tional operator. The American News
Company handled an edition of the
magazine -that is said to have num
bered 7C0.000.
In his story Lawson charges that H.
H. Rogers was instrumental in raisins
a $5,000,000 campaign fund to secure
the election of the Republican ticket
In 1SW>, at a time just bc-fore the elec
tion when it seemed possible that
Bryan mi?ht win. Marcus A. Hanna.
he says, had called into consultation a
half-dozen of the biggest financiers
In Wall Ftreet and it was decided to
â¢turn" at least five of the doubtful
States?. Larson's article Bays:
" 'Lawson.* paid Rogers, looking at
zne with intenfe and deadly serious
ness, his voice charged with convic
tion, 'if Eiyan'g elected there will be
euch a panic in this country as the
â¢world has never seen. and. with hi*
mean ideas and the radicals -he will
call to Washington to administer the
nation's affairs, business will surely
be destroyed and the working people
will suffer untoid misery. You know
Tve all hate to do what 'Uncle Mark'
eays is necessary, but it's a case of
some of us 'sacrificing something for
the country's pood." "
BAY STATE GAS SCAXDALu
Referring to the Bay State Gas Com
pany, Lawson tells of having been in
the Hoffman House, where the di
rectors had gathered in Addicks' suite,
â waiting to hear whether a receiver had
.been appointed. The Addicks end had
told them nothing, and Addicks.
he says, was calm and collected. At
the invitation of Addicks, Lawson
says, he passed into another room, and
"what occurred there he describes as
follows: â¢
"He passed ahead of me through the
email r>arlor into his bedroom. I fol
lowed. He went straight to the bu
reau, took something: from a drawer,
slipped . it Into his pocket, turned and
dropped upon the lounge. But a frac
tion of a minute had elapsed since he
had left the telephone and I, being be
hind, had not seen his face. He looked
at me. Could this gray ghost be the
same man who had *ust before been
emiling so contentedly at Parker
Chandler's last story? His face . was
the coior of a mftldy lead pipe and
seared with strange lines and seams.
The eyes that met mine were dim and
glazed, lusterless end dead as a fish's
eyes dragged from watery depths.
" 'Lawson, the game's up,* he said in
a trembling voice. "That was Fred at
the shone. (Fred Keller was his per
sonal Eecretary.) He pays White Bray
man has had himself appointed re
ceiver of the Bay State; that he raided

SANTA ROSA, E>ec. 20.â Local agita
tion over the grade crossing asked for
by the Petaluma and Santa Rosa Elec
tric Railway Company across- the
tracks of the California North
western Railroad on lower-. Third
street reached the acute stage to
day when Pesident A. W.. Foster
of the latter company, replied
to a recent communication addressed
to him by a committee of locai mer
chants upon the subject: The meri
chants threatened to divert freight
shipments to the electric road after to
day unless the crossing asked for was
granted.
Foster's reply was courteous but firm,
the railroad company renewing the con
tention that to allow the electric line
to cross company's freight yards at the
point named would be too dangerous.
The letter also contained an offer to
donate half the cost cf an overhead or
underground crossing to charity.
Sentiment here to-night is somewhat
divided, although several merchants an.
nounce their determination to ship only
by. electric line. The new road I3 now
completed and running from Scbastopoi
to the ?art of town where crossing is
desired, and also from Sebastopol to
Petaluma, and is doing a good business.
The merchants are operating free
buses from 'the end of the line to the

MARACAIBO, Venezuela. Dec. 20.â
A grave condition of affairs exists in
Venezuela, due to the administration
of - President .Castro. -His relentless
course in politics is illustrated in an in
stance which has by thjs time been
presented to President Roosevelt
through a letter of appeal written by
the mother of a political prisoner, in a
dungeon of Fort San Carlos at Mara
caibo. The letter reads in part:
"I come as a last resort to implore
your pity. I am a widowed mother,
to whom there remains but one son, the
others having perished on' the battle
fields of my unhappy country- The sur
vivor Is a political prisoner since more
than two years ago without the shadow
of right or cause, by some whim of a
tyrant. .
"I have begged President Castro to
receive and hear me that I might en

wretched son was not guilty. I hum

answer my prayers, but he has 'had me

his fate because they have tried to cast

terrorized Venezuela, in the Â°- name^ of

ENACTS CAB
TRAGEDY IN
PANTOMIME
"Man" Patterson Is
a Dramatic
Witness,
Emerges Triumphant From
a Merciless Cross-
Examination.
ProsMution Rests Its Case and tho
Young Woman's Fate Will
Soon Be Known.
NEW YORK. Dec. 20.â After a day of
torment, facing the merciless cross-ex
amination of Prosecutor Rand, "Nan"
Patterson, the former show girl, went
to her cell in the Tombs to-nlgh* tired,
but happy. For several hours she sat
under the galling cross-fire of the As
sistant District Attorney, who probed
the events of her life from the day she
met Caesar Young, for the killing of
whom she is being tried, till the mo
ment of his tragic death*. No detail
was so trivial as to escape the attention
of the State's attorney, but with
scarcely an exception the accused act
ress proved a marvel of setf-control.
Only once did Rand confuse ner
greatly. In going over the conversa
tion between her and Young at the
Gravesend track Miss Patterson testi
fied that Young gave as a reason for
sailing to Europe the fact that he was
afraid Mrs. Young might harm him or
the prisoner. Miss Patterson finally
admitted .that she recalled only an In
cident which had occurred in San Fran
cisco. - - -.â¢:â "--, .:.
GIVES FRANK ANSWERS.
At times she parried the sharp queÂ»
tiens of her inquisitor, but" when he
pinned her down to indefinite question
lief "Answer, Jnrais frankness Itself. Miss
Patterson talked in a low, clear voice,
punctuating her evidence, here and
there with expressions of much, spirit.
In the course of -'one of her answers
she exclaimed In a voice ringing with
sincerity:
"1 have always tried to be truthful
and honorable."
Miss Patterson was led over the same
gound -to-day as yesterday, in a man
ner manifestly different, for to-day she
was under the rapid fire questioning: of
the manÂ» who handled the case against
her,' and legal pitfalls were to be ex
pected.
There were few striking ad
missions made by the witness.
despite the very searching ques
tions asked. Noticeable among
these, However, was. the story of the
money given by the bookmaker to Miss
Patterson during their acquaintance. At
one time the sum was {2300, at another
(2500 and at another $1800 or $1500. She
did not know the total amount and
could not state whether it would total
$50,000, but acknowledged that Young
was a very generous man and gave her
money whenever she asked for it.
Miss Patterson said that Young was
fearful that Mrs. Young would kill him
and possibly the actress also, and for
that reason wished her to flee to Eu
rope with him: Later she modified this
under the battery of the prosecutor. .'
DEATH SCENE RE-ENACTED. ,
The dramatic climax of to-day's
court scene came with the pantomime
enacted /by Miss Patterson and a Dis
trict Attorney's messenger, showing
the death; scene in the cab. Seated side
by side on a platform facing the court
and the J"iiry, the messenger under the
tutelage^ of tho former showgirl, they
swayed back and forth as the prisoner
said she and Young had done Just be
fore th,e shooting. With the calm re
serve of one accustomed to play to
thousands. Miss Patterson, without a
tremor, went over the scene and by

MORMONS NOT
HELD TO LAWS
Witness Says That County
Attorney Refuses 'to Prose
cute Offenders in Utah
IKECESS IX THE CASE
Members of the Church Who
Are Wanted to Give Tes
timony Have Disappeared
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.â In the
Reed Smoot hearing the attorneys for
the protestants have concluded the ex
amination of all persons who could be
reached by the subpenas issued by the
Senate Committee. Attorney Tayler
announced that he was ready to rest
his case except for the introduction of
documentary evidence and the exam
ination later of some persons whom it
has been impossible to bring before the
court. The case of the respondent will
be opened January 10, to which date the
hearing has been adjourned.
Just before the adjournment of the
committee the opposing lawyers en
gaged in a controversy over the admis
sibility of certain evidence regarding
the doctrines of the Mormon faith. No
agreement could be reached, and after
heated arguments Tayler recalled
Apostle Penrose to identify certain ref
erence books. In a number of instances
Mr. Penrose denied that the works had
been accepted by the church as'author
itative publications and said that many
of the matters contained in the docu
ments were subject to dispute. Chair
man Burrows ruled that the utterances
of leaders of the church may be offered
as tending to prove doctrines of the
church organization.
APOSTLE WITH XI XE WIVES.
The principal witness on the stand to
day was Charles Owen, who has been
employed in gathering evidence to be
used against the Mormon church in the
Smoot inquiry. He testified in regard
to the charges against prominent
church officials and as to the attitude
of courts and prosecuting attorneys in
such cases. He declared that such
prosecutions are unavailing, as when
convictions were obtained small fines
were imposed and in most cases these
were paid by popular subscription.
Owen testified that he had made the
closest investigation possible about po
lygamy in Utah, and never accepted
any one man's word about polygamous
marriages. He said Apostle Taylor is
reputed to have taken two wives within
two or three years, and that Apostle
Cowley has taken a new wife within
three years. Taylor now has five wives,
said the witness.
"Where- are Apostles Cowley and
TayJc-r?" asked Mr. Burrows.
"I 'understand they are in hiding in
Canada," said the witness. * Continuing
he said "Apostle Merrill had nine wives,
two taken since the manifesto. Con-
Bultjng the "Church Encyclopedia," the
witness said Apostle Merrill has for
ty-five children and 127 grandchildren.

brought out a
great xnatty names of persons reputed
to be living in polygamy, together with
. dates of marriages and the number of
"children born of these plural marriages
since the manifesto.
Witness Owen testified to swearing
out an Information for Apostle Heber
J. Grant because of his mentioning his
polygamous relations in an address be
fore a Utah seminary. Owen said
Grant left the country and has not
since returned.
Owen was recalled in the afternoon
and his examination wap resumed con
cerning attempts to bring about prose
cutions on charges of unlawful cohab
itoation. Owen said cases were insti
tuted against the late Lorenzo Snow,
president of the Mormon Church; Jos
eph P\ Smith, now president of the
church, and Brigham H. Roberts, who
was elected a member of Congress, but
was denied his seat on account of his
having plural .wives. â¢
PHOSECCTIOX REFUSED.
I Many instances of Mormon officials
refusing to recognize information
charging polygamy were reported to
the committee by the witness. The in
formation in the caseagalnst President
Smith 'was sworn during the past
summer and was based on 'admissions
of polygamous cohabitation made to
the Senate Committee since the open
ing of the Smoot investigation. A Gen
tile. County Attorney declined to prose
cute, said thewitness. :, /
The witness said he was approached
when the Lorenzo Snow, case was in
stituted before Judge Bartch, a mem
ber, of the Supreme Court of Utah, and
urged to withdraw 5 the prosecution* on
the gound that it was ill-advised, Presi
dent Snow being a very old man and
one whosA prosecution would arouse a
great disturbance. Owen said he told
Judge Bartch that President Snow then
had in his house an infant born to his
ninth wife and that, being the head of
the church and one of the signers of
the application for amnesty, his vio
lations of the law were particularly of
fensive.
Tayler. representing the protestants,
said he had concluded his case except
to put in documentary evidence. He
asked the right however, to call other
witnesses, who thus far have not been
found, although search has been made
for them.
NINE NUNS RESCUED'
i FROM CONVENT FIRE
Carried Frdtm Burning Builciinc Down
a Ladder by Firemen in
Chicago.
CHICAGO, Dec. 20.â The thrilling
rescue of nine nuns, Sisters of Hotel de
Dleu, marked the progress of a fire
that swept through the convent and
destroyed it to'-day. Two of the nuns
were injured and were carried from
the building, almost overcome by
smoke. The stairs fell before the
sisters could reach them. The women
were rescued by the timely arrival of
the firemen, who carried them down
a ladder from the burning building..
The sisters belong to the order
known as the Sisters of Hotel de'Dieu
of the French Hospitaller Sisters.
They' came from Quebec, Canada, a

"If the details of the great reorgani

: Telling of the settlement of the Bay
State troubles, Lawson mentions that
when a formal motion to dismiss the
receivership was made there were in
the court room two dress suit cases in
which there was 5175,000 in currency.
The minute the dismissal was entered
in the court records, these two suit
cases were passed to two different men
and they fairly ran from the room to
a railroad yard, where they jumped
aboard a special car and engine.
Formal complaint was lodged to-day
with District Attorney Jerome by coun
sel for Henry M. Wack, alleging on
information and belief that Thomas W.
Lawson made, thirty separate false
statements in newspapers concerning
the Amalgamated Copper Company.
An appointment was made for- 11:30
o'clock to-morrow and, unless present
plans are upset, warrants for Lawson's
arrest will be issued before nightfall.
The positive assertion was made to
night that Standard Oil interests had
no intention of instituting an action for
criminal libel or any other proceeding
against Thomas W. Lawson, his pub
lishers, the Ridgway-Thayer Company,
or the American News Company be
cause of anything that has thus far
been embodied in the "Frenzied Fi
nance" articles, of which Lawson is
the author.
As to the position of H. H. Rogers
and his associates who had anything
to do with Bay State Gas matters, it
it may- be said authoritively that
their side of the transaction will be
told at the proper time and in the
proper place â the United States court
âwhen the suit brought by the re
ceiver against Rogers and others will
come up for trial in two or three
months. . â¢
BOSTON. Mass.. Dec. 20â Denis
Donohue, the reputed author of several
articles in the New York Commercial
attacking some of Lawson's mining
properties, hag so stirred Lawson to
anger that to-night he prepared an ad
vertisement defending his properties
and addressing Donohue in yitupejra

Donohue and telling him that if he
should appear in Boston the outcome
would be different from that in the
case of Colonel Greene last week.

day before he died he said he was afraid
his wife would be a murderess? - .
Well, the reason was that he recalled some
thing: that happened in San Francisco.'
And that is the reason you told the Jury
that Young said he was afraid his wife would
kill him or you?
I did not mean to say that.
As a matter of fact he had no fear his
wife would kill him?
1 do not know whether he did or not.
And he never told -you so?'- > â¢
No.
FEARED AX OCEAX VOYAGE.
Miss Patterson said that when she
told Young she would follow him to
Europe she had no idea of doing so.
She was afraid of the ocean trip. She
would have gone with Young had he
asked her, but would not go alone.
It seemed best, however, to have
1 otlngr believe that her promise was
made in good faith and beyond telling
him that she did not fancy an ocean
trip -alone she said nothing to the con
trary. They talked the plans all over
again while? sitting in a Harlem restau
rant early in; the morning of June 3.
Young drank great quantities of
whisky while they talked, while she
was very careful not to drink too
much. While sitting in the restaurant
Young gave her $100 â five $20 bills.
Her purse was full of bills, so she put
the money in her stocking.
The witness recalled distinctly hav
ing told Young during the cab drtve
that she abandoned her idea of fol
lowing him to Europe.
j I told him there was no use in talking
about me going to Europe, "Because I am
not going." I said. Then he reached over
and seizing my wrists, drew me toward htm.
I did not want him to see that he had hurt
me and turned my face away. Then came
the report of the shot. - .
It was at this point that the wit
ness was called upon to give in panto
mine, with the aid of a messenger boy,
thÂ«> struggle between Young and her
self in the cab.
MRS. YOUNG RECALIiED.
Mrs. Margaret Young, the book
maker's widow, was then recalled and
after a series of objections had been
overruled was allowed to testify that
it was upon her husband's suggestion
that the tickets for Europe were pur
chased. She was not allowed, how
ever, to tell the Jury how much prop
erty her husband left at his death.
Every question put to Mrs. Young by
Rand met with an objection from
Levy and several brief but heated
arguments betwen counsel resulted.
While the arguments were going on
Mrs. Young glanced around the crowd
ed courtroom. Once her. eyes met
those of "Nan" Patterson and the de
fendant turned her head away.
Mrs. Young said that she and her
husband had been estranged for a

San Rafael Minister Gives
Up Pulpit and Strange Are
the Tales Now Being Told
HE SWEARS, IT IS SAID
Women Folks Aver Preacher
Used Too Many Cigarettes
and Wore Open Work Hose
Â»
Epeclal D:tpa'.ch to TfcÂ« CalL
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. 20.â Cigarettes
and openwork scrcks were two of the
items that caused a disagreement be
tween Rev. Robert E. Lee Craig of
Grace Church and his flock. The ultra
modern pastor was last seen yesterday
bound for the San Rafael depot in an
express wagon. All his household*
goods were with him. It is given out
by the vestrymen that Craig has re
signed voluntarily and geme to accept
a call in Mississippi.
Craig came to the peaceful town of
San Rafael in May last. On first sight
the members of Grace Church thought
that his raiment was too loud for the
place and for his cailing. His low-cut,
patent-leather shoes exposing open
work hosiery made the conservative
gasp. His excessive use of cigarettes
shocked the parents and friction re
sulted.
Coming from the South and bearing
the name of Robert E. Lee, Craig nat
urally hated negroes. His first act on
taking charge of Grace Church was to
discharge a colored sextion.
"No niggers," declared the Rev. R. E.
L. Craig in decided tones.
The congregation began to dwindle
and the choir evaporated, all except the
paid singers. It began to be whispered
around the tea tables that the minister
swore terribly in and but of church,
ripping, emphatic oaths, such as are
used by Kentucky colonels. On one oc
casion it is reported that^the reverend
gentleman's language was so strong
that it sent one of the prominent young
ladies of the congregation Into hyster
ics. A bevy of girls were engaged in
decorating the church when the strenu
ous pastor appeared, and they claim he
broke into a storm of profanity so
strong that one of their number was
overcome by the shock.
The vestrymen, while they do not
deny these stories outright, maintain
that differences with the congregation
did not cause Rev. R. E. L. Craig to
depart for the sunny South, where
openwork socks cause no shocks and
where the ousting of a negro is consist
ent even In a clergyman. They say that
he resigned of his own accord. Rev.
Charles Hitchcock will tend to the spir
itual wants of Grace Church until an
other pastor can be found.
Following are statements from some
of the vestrymen:
George Buttlerâ Craig resigned. I
don't think he found the congregation
congenial, as he was a strong South
erner.
Colonel Charles Burrer â He was not
asked to resign. I know nothing.
John F. Boydâ He resigned of his
own accord.
S. B. Moorheadâ He resigned to take
a church in Mississippi, his wife's
home.

INSANE ASYLUM
AS A HOSPITAL
Sophie 31 orris Says She Was
Committed to Institution
Through Misrepresentation
SUES FOR .DAMAGES
Woman Accuses Her Tenants
of Sending Her to Agnews
When Her Mind Was Sound
llecommending an Insane asylum as
a hospital, inviting rest for a daughter
worn with nursing an invalid mother,
would seem io be an ironical Jest, but
the suggestion is made in a complaint
just filed in the Superior Court.
The story is told by Sophie Morris
against- Hugh Hughes and his wife.
Louisa, sister of Miss Morris. She
sues them for $20,000 damages as the
price of her mental anguish and injured
reputation. Her attorney is , C. W.
Eanin.
J It is recited that for three and a half
years the plaintiff and her mother lived
at 1916 Green street. The mother was
an invalid and unable to perform any
household duties, and the daughter had
the sole care of her. On January 1,
last. Hughes and his wife moved from
San Jose to this city and rented a part
of the house occupied by the .Morrises.
Then the defendants are said to have
represented to Sophie Morris that Ag
ueVs '.vas a hospital where she could
get rest from the long and constant
care of her mother. She was told, she
says, that it would be necessary to get
the consent of a Superior Judge be
fore she could go to the institution and.
on March 28. she was induced to be
committed to the asylum and was sent
th*>re in charge ol a public officer.
ShÂ» was confined for two months and
twelve days among the insane, al
though, she says, she was not insane
herself. She declares that she did not
know that Agnews was an asylum.
During the period of her confinement
her mother became very ill. The
daughter, -In charge of an attendant,
was permitted to come to her. but was.
she ravs, dragged from the dying wo
man's bedside by the Hugheses and
sent back to Agrnews. -She declares that
the authorities were so shocked at the
inhumanity of her treatment that they
returned her to her home, and next day
the mother died. The plaintiff was
taken back to the asylum, and on the
ninth tÂ»f June- the medical superinten
dent discharged her. of his own motion,
as Hughes would not consent to her re
lease.
ALLEGES CRUELTY.
When she oanve home, t?he says,
Hughes would not let her in. He
struck her, seized her. by the neck and
threw her. down the steps, according
to the allegations, and then had her
taken to the . Emergency Hospital.
There, continues the plaintiff, an ef
fort was made to have her committed
to the Stockton asylum on a charge of
insanity, but it failed. Next, she de
clares, proceedings were instituted in
the Probate Court to have a guardian
appointed for her; witnesses were sub
penaed and the action stood- four
months before it was dismissed.
While she was in the asylum, and
after, it is alleged, the defendants cir
culated the report that Sophie Morris
was insane from the excessive use of
intoxicating liquors.
For the commitment to Agnews she
demands $10,000 damages and for the
acts committed after her release she
asks as much more.
HUGHES DENIES ALI,.
Hugh Hughes, speaking of the suit
filed against him by Sophie Morris,
said:
Her claims axainrt me for fiamarw aiÂ» Â«!m
pjy absurd. Everything In thU house belongs
to me. except one Â»mail bedstead. Her stated
menl that 1 struck her la .TaJs*. I have lived
Â©n this roast for forty years and I think my
reputation for honesty U pretty well estab
Â»ished here. I do not wish to ro into any de
tail statement of her conduct, as the manner
in which she has acted is well known to many
or the leading physicians of this city, among
â whom are Dr. Kerr and Dr. Devlin. She is
unfortunately entirely controlled by an all ab
sorbing love for Uquor. I have done everything
In my power to assist her. I have spent |2000
for her treatment at different hospitals and
sanitariums. But It has been all of no avail.
When her poor mother was lying here in m>
house at death's door wÂ« sent down to the
Affnews Asylum, wbere Miss Morris was under
treatment, and had her brought up here in
eare of a nurse, i that she might be with her
mother during her dying hours. On arrival
*Â» she acted Ilk* a raring; maniac Ehe
abue^d everybody la sight and kept up such a
fir* of talk that the nurse was obliged to take
ber away aicaln. Her case Is a pathetic one.
Ehe has a spiendld education, and wero It not
tor her terrible thirst for liquor would be a
woman of exceptional brilliancy.
This statement was entirely corrobo
rated by Mrs. Hughes, the sister of
Mies Morris.

Jacob ftiis Iteveals Uncanny
Conditions - 'That Prevail
in Great Atlantic City
SHOWS TENEMENT LIFE
Ex-Mayor Phelan .Presents
Distinguished Author to
Big Audience at Y. M. C. A.
Jacob A. Riis, author, newspaper man
and philanthropist, made his bow be
fore a San Francisco audience last
night at the Y. M. C. A., which was
crowded with some of the most repre
sentative citizens ofHhe city.
On the platform with the distin
guished visitor were ex-ifayor Phelan,
who introduced Mr. Riis in a graceful
speech and made flattering allusions to
President Roosevelt. Rolla V. Watt and
General Secretary McCoy of the Y. M.
C. A.
"The Battle With the Slums" was the
subject of the lecture and if Riis failed
for a moment to disclose the true, in
ward life of the conditions of slumdom
in the great city of New York it must
have been through the darkness of the
hovels which his picture reproduced on
the canvas. While his views were vivid
his graphic account of human suffer
ing and degradation (through "greedy
landlordism") was equal in portraiture
to the pictures he, when a reporter on
the New York Sun, and later, took
himself.
The fc-peaker showed tenements
wherein hundreds of families lived,
sans air, sans light. Bans sunshine; he
pictured with word and etereopticon the
overcrowding; men huddled together
like animals in a pen, sleeping on floor
and shelves, with bedding wretched and
dirty, and without so" much as a cover
ing for their shivering forms.
Children, were presented in the "nar
row, cold,' cheerless exteriors of these
tenements, and Riis asked would it be
surprising under such conditions if the
unfortunate young thrived on the crime
germs which such surroundings breed.
Such conditions, if allowed in any
city, he said, boded no good for the fu
ture of those unhappy ones who had to
endure them, and besides those ' very
conditions of depravity springing from
the "greed of the landlords" are a dan
ger, to the peace of a community, and
even to the ultimate prosperity and
foundation of the country.
Here in San Francisco the citizens
face the same peril as they do in New
York. If they overcrowd tenements
wherein twenty families are to be
housed under one roof there will be
slums In San Francisco, too, and we
will pay $1,000,000 for a block for play
grounds, as they have had to do in New
York.
He told of how they had had to fight
the conspiracy of "human selfishness
and greed" until last year a law was
enacted which prohibited the building
of a tenement which excluded the sun
shine arid air. There had been 360,000
dark rooms in the tenements and the
"Battle of the Slums," he said, will last
until thOFe. .dark rooms* are gone. \
Hils then showed pictures of the ten
rnents, which have been I lately con
structed as a result of the inquiry Into
the all-important-> subject, showing
marked improvement in exterior and
interior architecture and plans.
The lecturer was frequently applaud
ed, and at the close of his descriptive
narration he was given a perfect ova

With Praise of the Treat

Prince Fushimi of Japan, who' ar
rived here from the East at an early
-hour yesterday morning, spent a large
portion of the day. in GcHden Gate Park
.with the members erf his party and the
local Japanese reception committee.
During his absence, the local Japanese
colony, appreciating their distinguished
countryman's admiration for horses,
raised a fund of $1200, with which they
purchased a handsome white charger.
At the park yesterday the formal pre
sentation of the horse was made, and
the well-pleased nobleman, after thank
ing, his â  countrymen for their gift,
mounted the high-spirited animal and
tried him out over the park roads.
In the evening the Prince and his
suite dined in their apartments at the
St. Francis and retired early, prepara
tory of their departure for Monterey to
day. After a short sojourn there. they
will proceed down the coast as far as
Santa Barbara, returning in time to
embark, on the steamship Mongolia. It
is with considerable show of reluctance
that Prince Fushimi subjects himself
to interviews. In fact, he inrariably
shields .himself behind a stereotyped
excuse of his attendants that he is
"traveling" incognito" and is expected
to be free from the importunities of
newspaper representatives. Another
favorite excuse is that he is not an
English-speaking Japanese, but he
often shows his familiarity with'Eng
lish by unconsciously ' smiling when
some one is bold enough to make some
comment about him In 'English within
hearing. Last evening, when pressed
for a statement regarding his views of
the United States, in so far as he had
seen the country, he carefully studied
for a moment and then replied through
an interpreter! *

SEQUOIA CLUB
ENTERTAINS A
PAIR OF GUESTS
By Sally Sharp.
Two lions at the Sequoia Club! Small
wonder that a double hundred and
more of men and women sought out
the emerald clubroom at the St. Fran
eta last niffht, for the cards had al
luringly announced the guests of honor
to be Miss Hallle Erminie Rives and
Howard Malcolm Tichnor. Now, every
man In the club wanted to meet Mis3
Rives, even as every woman longed to
meet Mr. Tichnor, who knows more
about Browning, the prince of lovers,
than any man here at home, for West
ern men are not addicted to Browning
to any great extentâ rather do they
prefer a good fight, as witness the af
fair at the Pavilion last . night.
But to the credit of the Sequoia be
it said, that its menâ most of themâ
"passed .up" the allurements of the
ring for the pleasant ohatter of the
club. But a query went up through
the long, sweet night, "Where is Wil
liam Greer Harrison, the club leader,
director and raconteur?" Perish the
thought that the light lured him. It is
believed he was ill, else would he not
have missed bo Important a session of
the club he has nurtured so tenderly
since its inception.
After an interesting chatter, and a
swapping^of compliments twixt the
poets and artists and \ the others who
compose the audience, fflie members and
guests adjourned to the red reception
rooms, and there went Into executive
sessionâ which - sounds ' much more
formidable than it really wasâ with the
club president. Charles Sedgwick Aiken,
on the plano-stooL \
In a speech laden with fact and fancy
i r * . Alken dwelt upon the permanency
of the club, with its 300 members and
n long waiting list, and the general
impression that the clut) had-outgrown
its headquarters. Although' the hotel
management had been most cordial and
generous with the club, still there was
a general desire among members for
a home of their own.
This called forth a clever little speech
from John McNaught and a brace of
resolutions from Edgar Peixotto giv
ing the directors power to double the
dues and to find a suitable home with
the increased revenue.
After some discussion the matter
was decided upon, and before many
moons the Sequoia will be a house
holder of its. own. with its own latch
key.
After the momentous question had
been disposed of an excellent brew of
punch was served, with which the suc
cess of the directors in their hearth
stone search was drunk with many
orisons. v

CHAMBERLAIN
GIVEN A RAP
Henry Campbell-Banherman
Scores the Leader of the
English Tariff Movement
BITTER PERSONALITIES
Former Colonial -Secretary
Accused of Taking Far
Too Much Upon Himself
LONDON, Dec. 20.â The political
campaign of education in fiscal affairs,
which is now being vigorously carried
on throughout the United Kingdom by
both parties, while affording little that
is new In proposition or argument,
shows evidence of Increasing acrimony
and more personal feeling between the
leaders. Chamberlain, in addressing a
public meeting in the, East End, hit out
even more sharply than usual, and
showed no little feeling In reference to
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the
former Liberal leader in the House of
Commons, who had said of Chamber
lain, "At least he might try to be a
gentleman." ' '
Sir Henry to-night mads a speech In
the same hall and before an audience
equaling in numbers and enthusiasm
the one addressed by Chamberlain. Ha
dwelt at the outset at some'length upon
the subject of the unemployed of Lon
don, which now threatens to become a
serious question, and advocated that
the Government at once inaugurate
large works and thus benefit the state
and at the same time afford employ
ment to thousands who are threatened
with Starvation. Sir Henry then began
a reply to Chamberlain, and said:
"It Is not these who are forever
mouthing the word 'empire' and using
that word to cover, their own shady
acts and their own policies who are the
best friends of the empire."
Continuing, the speaker challenged
Chamberlain's right to speak for the
colonies, and asserted that Chamber
lain spoke only for himself and his
tariff commission; but the self-govern
-ing colonies had not authorized him
to speak In their name.
Sir Henry Campbell - Bannerman's
speech largely followed the lines of
his previous utterances, though it was
adapted to an audience composed of
typical â¢ residents of the East End.
POWER PLANT
FOR GOLDFIELD
Big Electric Project Now
Taking Shape for Develop
ing Kich Mining Claims
A^ million-dollar electrlo light and
power ' service for Tonopah, Goldfield
and the neighboring mining camps of
{Nevada is the latest enterprise planned
for those rich sections of the Sagebrush
State. It was learned yesterday that
the recent presence at the Palace Hotel
of Tasker Oddie. the millionaire min
ing man of Tonopah, and several
wealthy men from Denver, was in con
nection with this project
It is proposed to establish an electrlo
plant on Bishop Creek in Eastern Cal
jlfornia, about ninety miles from Gold
| field, Nev., where the generation of
the power will be accomplished and
transmitted to the mining district,
across the State line.
The surveys for the power line have
already been made" and' the work of
construction on the plant will begin
j In a few days. Interested in the com
j pany, beside Oddie, are Charles F. Pot-
I ter, a capitalist; Rodney Curtis, a
j tramway magnate of Denver; G- S.
I Wood, who represents Millionaire
i David Moffatt of Denver; Clarence
Hobbs and Frank J. Campbell, also
prominently identified with Colorado
enterprises.
Hobbs is now at Bishop superintend
ing the preliminary work. Throueh his
efforts the syndicate has secured wa
ter rights on Bishop Creek capable of
furnishing from 3000 to 6000 horse-
I power. It is also reported that during
his recent visit to Tonopah Dr. Ward,
j brother-in-law of Millionaire Charles
.! Schwab, who owns the Tononah Ex
tension mine, gave Oddie and his asso-
I elates assurance that Schwab would
â¢ contribute a share of the necessary
capital for the promotion of the elec
tric power and lighting project.
The completion of the power service
will be hailed with great satisfaction in
i the Nevada mining camps, to which it
will mean a great aid in the develop
ment of the properties. It Is also ex
pected that the establishing of the
j plant will result In the building of an
j electric road into Goldfleld and thence
to Tonopah.

HOSTILE BANDS
RUN TO EARTH
But One Group of Moros Now
Defies the Authority of
Americans in the Islands
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. â General
Wood, commanding the Department
of Mindanao in the Philippines, In his
annual report to the War Department,
says that the troops of the depart
ment have been In the field a greats
portion of the year quelling' armed
uprisings and preventing slave-trade
and kindred abuses. He, says that in
almost every Instance aptual fighting
â was Initiated by 'the Moros. " He adds:
Conditions among the Moros throughout thÂ«
department are renerally peaceful. The estat>
liphment of civil - s;overnment and thÂ« ex
tÂ«nsion over them of certain laws and regula
tions have caused some excitement and at
times serious resistance, especially the law
prohibiting slavery. In some sections active
hostility has been engendered by our presence,
especially In the Lake Lanao region, whera
almost constant murderous attacks on work
lugtnen and soldiers were the rule until tha
effects of the recent expeditions to the Tarca
side of the lake, combined with expeditions
to other sections of the Lanao, were felt by
the Moros. I
The power of the Moros of that
section, he says, has been completely
broken. Continuing, the report says:
la Jolo affairs are quiet. The prompt crush-
Ing of Hassan's uprising has made a deep
impression on the people, and the abrogation
of the Bates agreement has done much to
bring to an end the unfortunate conditions
which existed under It. *
Dato All's party, the report adds, is
the only band of Moros now openly
hostile and It is small and Is being'
followed by troops and scouts. Gen
eral Wood says it is believed there
â¢will not be any very serious resistance
of authority by the Moros in the fu
ture, but there will be constant work
of a police character, requiring the
use of troops and constabulary.
ST. LiOUIS. Mo.. Dec. 20.-â Four Moorish
dancing girls more or less reluctant, and three
not so .unwilling Moorish musicians, all of
whom had been left behind In St. Louis when
the World's Fair closed, have been deported to
their native country.

JURY FIXING

Federal Authorities Learn
of Efforts to Influence De
cision in Land Fraud Case
PORTLAND, Or.. Dec. 20.â It has be
come known that the Grand Jury.
which is Investigating the land frauds
charges, has been approached for the
purpose of influencing its decision. One
Juryman is known to- have been ap
proached and the manr/who did it ia
known to the Federal authorities. Tha
attempt was unsuccessful, so It 13 said.
It transpired that information is leak-,
ing from the jury room as to what la
taking place there. This would not be
serious if it did not indicate that it is
possible to get into communication
wiâ¬h the Jury-
The witnesses before the Grand Jury
to-day were S. B. Ormsby, a former
forest ranger: Marie Ware; T. Jacobs,
one of the principal witnesses in the
first case, and Mrs. Emma L. Watson,
already convicted of conspiracy, who.
it is said, has confessed. Nothing la
known as to the nature of their testi
mony.
It Is thought that no announcement*
will come from the Jury until the last
of the present week. Saturday, accord
ing to present intention, the Jury will
adjourn until after .the holidays, when
it is expected that some very impor
tant indictments will be returned.

SAX JOSE. Dec. 20.â Late into last
eight Principal Hunt and the faculty of
the High School worked to hide the ob
jectionable"* Joshes" In "The Bell,"
the echool paper, so as to get the edi
tion mailed to-day. Strips of paper
were pasted over the offensive para
graphs. In nearly every home where
the publication was received the page
was at once steamed over the teaket
tle and the paster removed. This is what
one cf the young lady students at the
Echocl stated that she and all her
friends did, and the High School stu
dents are passing the lip around.
After reading the "Joshes" most of
the people side in with the students, as
the Jokes are believed to be harmless.
The censoring of the edition by the fac
ulty has created a large demand for the
issue.
Yesterday afternoon Principal Hunt
had the printers deliver the edition of
The Bell to the High School. This has
als-o caused some trouble. The papÂ«r
â was published at the instance of the
students and they are responsible for
the payment of the printing bill. They
hardly feel now as though they should
be called upon to settle the bill when
the faculty has taken and mutilated the
number.

GOLD RIDE TO VISIT BRITT
ENDS WITH HOT TIME
PHILOSOPHY QF- WARM-CLOTHES
Miss Vogt Reaches Logical Conclusion
BY' JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Justice must Indeed be blind. Miss
N*orma Vogt declared, if it failed to
award both her end Miss Grace Dillon
something more than mere acquittal
as compensation fcr their arrest and
arraignment. For of all the police out
rages that ever were committed In this
city. Miss Vogt added, the incarcera
tion of herself and lady friend was the
worst. It might be pleaded that the
patrolman was less to blame than the
chauffeur who instructed him. but that
plea would not lessen the humiliation
to which she and Miss Dillon had been
subjected.
Then the spirit of justice personified
by Police Judge Mogan requested Miss
Vogt to narrate her grievance as lucid
ly as would be compatible ""with the
brevity necessitated by a congested
calendar.
"There ain't much in the story It-
Belf." she responded, "but there's a
whole lot in the way we were mis
treated. Me and Gracle are sitting in
our room and she says, 'Norma, I'm
getting the blues and if we don't do
something to drive 'em away I'll go
bughouse sure." Me, knowing what the
blues is, says, 'Well, klddo, how would
an' automobile ride hit you?' So she
says, 'Let's go to â " "
"You went riding in an automobile.
Then what?"
Miss Vosrt resented yie judicial im
patience by coldly remarking that if
she were not permitted to tell the tale
In her own way she would prefer to
abstain from telling it at all. To which
the bench retorted by asking her to cut
it as short as possible.
"Well, we goes and hires George
Bird's machine â he's the chaff, you
knowâ and the gentleman that owns it
says, 'Kids, if you're going out to see
Britt train you'll find it a cold ride,
and you'd better put these on,* and he
hands Grade the sweater she's now
wearing and lends me this overcoat
hanging on my arm. So we spins to
the. beach and has a couple of drinks
apiece to keep us warm and comes
back to Taylor and O'Farrell.
streets and I goes into * a coffee joint
to get something hot, leaving Gracie
in the machine at the <Joor, and when
I comes out she's â¢ been pinched. â Is
that short enough for you?"
"Go on â what was she pinched for?"
"That's what I ask George and he
says he gets her pinched because she
refuses to take off the sweater right
there on the street and let him wear it.
So I says, says I, 'Well for the Lord's
sake, kid, are you crazy, getting her
pinched for that?' and he says, 'She'b
a fresh guy, anyway,' and I says, 'If
there's a fresher guy than j-ou I'dâ'"
"Then you were arrested?"
"The next thing I knows he gets me
pinched for talking to him, and when â "
"That's all â next witness."
Neither the next witness nor the wit
ness succeeding him said anything that
could be construed to convict either of
the defendants of any offense more
serious than free indulgence in lan
guage uncomplimentary to the chauf
feur and his forebears, so the case was
dismissed and justice vindicated.
Miss Dillon promised to return the
sweater to its owner as soon as she
could remove it without endangering
her health or giving a public exhibition,
and Miss Vogt said "You can take it
right now," as she tossed the overcoat
to the chauffeur.
In the personality of Charles Kneus,
classified as "bay pirate," there was
nothing suggestive of the dashing buc
caneer of romance. His garb was con
ventionally modest and his demeanor
slinking.

the Fotrero, but he escaped by leaping
into his long, low, rakish, craft and
sculling into a heavy fog. Not until
last Monday was he again seen at his
old haunt. Patrolmen Buckley and
McSorley were his captors and Judge
Fritz gave him six months.
Park Patrolman Kavanagh described
Edward Smith and John Kennealy as
"bushwhackers," and when Judge Mo
gun lequested a. definition of the term
he was informed that "bushwhacking"
consists of blackmailing as it is prac

great playground their theater of oper
ation. It was the wont of Smith and
Kennealy, the officer further .eluci
dated, to crouch behind benches upon
which were seated two persons of dif

own pecuniary advantage such compro
mising remarks as might come from

obtained a livelihood by means other
than "bushwhacking," both were pro
nounced guilty of vagrancy and re
manded for sentence.
Patrolman Ruggles had heard- of a
game termed "the devil among the
tailors," and he was reminded of it
when he entered the sartorial estab
lishment on Mission street at which
William Cohen and Max Fenler were
employes. The shop was in uproar
occasioned by the rude and'boisterous
behavior of Mr. Cohen, who filled the
satanic role. He had battered the
face of Mr. Fenler and seemed to be
so maddened by rage that there was
no knowing where his mania might
stop, a fact appreciated by the other
persons present, all of whom, includ
ing a woman, were much terrified. So
the officer pitted his prowess against
that of Mr. Cohen and after a brief
struggle had him subjugated. Arrest
followed, the charge being battery.
Testimony showed that workshop
gossip was at the bottom of the Ber
serk performance. Mr. Cohen had
broadly hinted to some of his fellow
knights of the needle that Mr. Fenler
was not a proper person for gentle
men to associate with, inasmuch as
his Lotharian propensities led him
into questionable places and situa
tions. These bits of tattle reached
Mr. Fenler's ears, of course, and he
hastened to tax Mr. Cohen with ma
licious libel, but did not proceed fur
ther in the way of rebuke, Mr. Cohen
being his superior in physical devel
opment. Mr. Cohen, however, did not
accept the "call down" in the spirit
anticipated by its author, for he in
stantly proceeded to asasult Mr. Fen
ler and his rage waxed apace with his
fistic exercise until the shop was
transformed into the pandemonium
described by Patrolman Ruggles.
Judge Mogan afforded Mr. Cohen
full and free opportunity to prove dis
paragement of Mr. Fenler's character,
but all the witnesses . produced by
him â including the tailoress afore al
luded to â absolutely failed to furnish
corroboration of his charges. Then
he pleaded excess of anger as his ex
cuse for attacking Mr. Fenler ami re
sisting the officer, but the Judge In
formed him that bad temper Is no
more mitigatory of law breaking than
is drunkenness and remanded him for
sentence to-day.
Police Captain Duke -was in plain at
tire as he strolled along Hinckley alley
and leisurely surveyed the domiciles
therein contained, with a probable view
to having his geography correct If a
raid should be ordered. While thus en
gaged he was hailed by Miss Maud

in Denver. \
DENVER, Dec. 20. â The Supreme
Court to-day heard testimony on the
contempt charges against Isaac Gold
man and Ed Sweeney for their part in
the election in Precinct 3, Ward 4,
this city. This precinct is the original
"Green Count," from which in 1903
720 votes were returned, one more
than the total registration, and all but
eight for the Democratic ticket.
Matt G. Root, a Supreme Court
watcher, testified that Goldman and
Sweeney, who were election judges, al
lowed many persons to vote who were
not properly registered. He said thai
a girl not over 18 years of age was
permitted to cast a ballot after her
vote had been challenged, although the
name she gave (Marie French) was
not in the registration book.
The court ordered the ballot box
opened this afternoon. Expert' Hanna

NEW YORK. Dec. 20.â A paper
read before the New York County
Medical Association by a professor of
clinical medicine in' the New York
Polytechnic Medical School I on the
subject of water drinking has aroused
considerable discussion at the monthly â¢
meeting of the members. The profes
sor said:
The abuses of water drinhirtg are committed
by every one In his routine work. r-ual!y no
harm Is done, even though we fai! to achieve
the result* dÂ»slred. But the contrary la trun
In thc not Infrequent cases where we add to
thÂ» burdens of an already taxed heart and
circulation, ami where we thoughtlessly aug
ment thc embarrassments of organ* we arw
striving to relieve. ,
Most striking of all 1* the abuse of water
drinking In chronic nephritis. Patients require
no urging to drink as much a* possible. T .
doubt the efficacy of kidney flushing Is thÂ«
rankest heresy. That- roo-1 might result from
reducing the dally amount of fluids to normal
quantities Is comprehensible.
In heart dl.vase the abuse of fluids la lesi

"BABE" CURTIN NOT MAN
WHO KILLED BROWN
POLICE EFFORTS BALKED
Lose Hope of Making Arrest
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
10'â¬ Broadway, Dec. 20.
Anthony ("Babe") Curtin, who was
crrested In San Franc! sco on "sus
1/icion," is not the lone footpad who
has been operating in Oakland and
n-ho murdered Policeman George W.
Brown. Five Oaklanders who had been
held up and robbed within a week saw
Curtin to-day at the City Trison in San
Francisco, and each one of them was
positive that the prisoner was not their
assailant.
Detective Holland this morning es
corted tha five across the bay. They
were J. B. Duarte, residing at 409Vi
East Twelfth street; W. H. Britton, 815
Thirteenth street; Milton Buikeley, 541

excellent opportunity to observe and
converse with Curtin. They were unan

which to work. They have covered

TO TEST THE
PRIMARY LAW
Socialists Would Stop Coun
cil From Calling Election
Under Present Conditions
Oakland office San Fancisco Call
1016 Broadway. Dec. 20.
An order directed to the City Council
to chow cause why it should not be
enjo'ned from calling a primary election
to be held January 31 was made
by Judge Melvin to-day upon the rep
resentation of M. Lesser, recent candi
date for Congress on the Socialist
ticket. It is contended in his statement
that the primary election law under
â¢which the call will be made is in viola
tion of the constitution of the State of
California of the United States. The
order was issued and made returnable
Friday, December 3.
Acting for the Socialist party it is
proposed by Lesser to test the validity
of the present primary election law and
to this end he will take an appeal 'to
the Supreme Court If necessary- It is
claimed that the constitutional provi
sion which requires a secret ballot Is
practically nullified by the present
primary law and Is a protest on the
part of the Emaller parties against
'what they deem the unjust effect of the
primary law upon their conventions.
Lesser as a taxpayer protests against
the expenditure of money for conduct-
Ing a primary election. So far every
primary election law has been declared
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court
and it remains to be seen if the present
one is an improvement upon its pre
decessors.
MAYOR INSISTS THAT
ALL SIGNS SHALL GO
XtfT>lies to Merchants' Objections by
Declaring That the City Should
Adopt Modern Methods.
OAKLAND, Dec. 20. â Major Olney
to-day issued orders to Chief of Police
Hodgkins to remove forthwith all
etreet and sidewalk signs of every de
scription that are maintained contrary
to law. Merchants have objected to
the Mayor's stand in the matter. In
reply his Honor said:
The fact that these figns have dlsfigurt-d
and obstructed streets and sidewalks for many
year* is r.o reason tvny the nuisance should be
continued. Oakland, it seems- to me. is big
enough to adopt a f*w modern improvements.
I do not know of any city of 1UO.OOO popula
tion v! >:â¢â¢ such a littering of the sidewalks
would be tolerated.
Though there may be a temporary cry of
protest Â«Eair.st the removal of obstructing
sig-ni I am satisfied that It will not be long
before th* people will Â»ee the wisdom of the
change. Oakland is beyond the village rtage
and tt behooves our people to appreciate that
tact.

WANTS PUPILS
TO USE HANDS
Superintendent of Schools
McClymonds Urges Exten
sion of Manual Training
Oakland Office San Francisco Call
1016 Broadway, Dec. 20.
.T. W. McClymonds, City Superintend
ent of Schools, has made a plea to the
L : oard of Education for an increase
in the appropriation for manual train
ling in the public schools. In his an
nual report the Superintendent urges
that industrial training is holding the
nttention of educators the world over.
He declares that during thÂ« last two
decades it has steadily advanced until
it occupies an important place In the
course of study in all well-conducted
schools.
New methods of handling children
alon^r individual lines are given atten
tion In the report. "The courses in na
ture study, comments Superintendent
McClymonds, have been productive of
excellent results. He asserts that par
ents testify to the benefits their chil
dren derived from awakened interest
in the gardens, fields, hills and water
courses. . â¢ 'â¢
Kindergartens are the subject of fa
vorable recommendation by Superin
tendent McCIymonds, who sees the
need of classes in every school in the
city. There are only two in operationâ
cne -it the Tonipkins and one at the
Garflsld School. The Superintendent
reports that the school for the deaf as
conducted by the department has been
a success, the experiments having
proved satisfactory in every respect
In his remarks upon manual train
ing Superintendent McClymonda says:
Since the opening of the Polytechnic High
School, -when manual training- became a part
of the work of this school, the Oakland school
department has not been offering the grammar
jrrad's the advantages of manual training the
spirit of the age demands. . The pupil has the
right to be introduced to the industrial side
cf life through manual training In the
school*. Machines are doing much ef the work
formerly <1onÂ»? by hand. Opportunities are no
longer affcrded in tiie homes for hand train
ins.. It I* thei'dutj' of the State to supply
this deficiency. The best time to acquire this
training' is in youth. The schools should fur
nish appliances and the opportunities for the
proper tievÂ»!opment of thÂ« industrial instincts
of the children.
Superintendent McClymonds pointed
nut that one step forward had been
made by the favorable action of the
Eoard of Education on a recommenda
tion by its committee on industrial ed
ucation to install teachers of" sloyd
and domestic science in the Garfield
and the Tompklns schools.

LIE IS PASSED
IN COURTROOM
Attorney Philip )M. Walsh
and W. S. O'Brieii Exchange
Compliments During Trial
RAPID FIEE OF WORDS
Late Political Opponents
Engage in a Tilt
During Damage Suit Case
Oakland office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Dec. 20.
A renewal of ante-election hostilities
seemed imminent this morning, when
Attorney Philip M. Walsh and W. S.
O'Brien, the man whom Walsh recent
ly defeated in the race for a seat- in the
Assembly, met in court, to try, a- suit
for damages brought by O'Brien
against Dr. S. II. Buteau. The lie was
freely passed, and for a time it seemed
as if the victorious candidate and his
late opponent would engage in com
bat." .'Â«-â .Â£>;,â â¢ :.t C â  V-
The suit brought by O'Brien against
Dr. Buteau was for injuries sustained
in a collision between a buggy driven
by the latter and a rig occupied by
Drs. Buteau and G. H. Liliencranz,
which happened on November 2, 1902.
O'Brien alleges that when his buggy
was struck by that of the defendant he
received injuries which will leava^ per
manent scars on his face and Jsody,"
and as a balm for his suffering and the
consequent disfigurement of his visage,
he asked damages in the sum of $299.
When the case was called for trial
to-day before Judge Geary, who oc
cupied the bench in place of Justice of
the Peace J. G. Quinn, O'Brien ap
peared as his own attor/iey. The de
fense was represented by Attorney Phil
M. Walsh. In the course of his testi
mony Dr. Buteau said that O'Brien ap
peared to be under the influence of
liquor at the time of the collision,, and
this remark provoked a storm. Leslie
Blackburn, who, was with O'Brien
when the accident happened, made
some personal remarks concerning
Walsh, and the He was passed several
times. Â«i-Â»'r~L
The difficulty was finally smoothed
over and as O'Brien desired time to
submit some authorities on the case,
Judge Geary took the matter under
advisement.

for damages brought against it by
reason of the Melrose explosion in
1898 was denied this afternoon by
Judge Ogden and it must proceed with
the trial and make its defense.
Attorney G. R. Lukens endeavored
to gain a nonsuit on the ground that
the case had already been twice
passed on by the Supreme Court. At

they are now making has never been
passed upon. They allege that the

that he believed it was a proper mat

REACH COURT
Widow Tyson Swears Out
Warrant for Arrest of
"Doc" William S. Proctor
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Dec. 20.
"Doc" William S. Proctor, who deals
in eyeglasses and life insurance, and
who says he owns an orange grove in
Southern California, .was arrested to
night at Niles and is charged with fel
ony in having secured from Mrs. E.
Tyson of that town $150 and some dia
monds upon a promise that he would
marry her". With Proctor is Ray Ash
berry, whose exact connection with the
case is a little uncertain, and who
both Proctor and he say has nothing
to do with-it. The warrant was sworn
to by.Mrs, Tyson, and it is for Ash
berry also. , â¢. .' â¢ . ..
Mrs. Tyson is a widow with a family
ofjgrown sons. The Tysons were among
the, original settlers of Washington
Township years ago, and the family,
has grown until it is an important part
of that community. Proctor first made
his appearance In Niles about a year
ago, and' since then he has ,been back
and forth several times. He came back
about a month ago, and was there until
his arrest by Constable Roderick upon
a warrant issued by Justice Sandholt:
The charge is that Proctor worked his
way into the affections of* the widow,
and upon a promise to- marry her ob
tained money at different times and fin
ally the jewelry.
"This is the work of the jealous son3
of Mrs. Tyson," said Proctor. "It Is
true that Mrs. Tyson arid I have had
some business dealings, but they were
stiictly business and legitimate. Her
sons got jealous and thought I was get
ting money that ought to go to them.
I do not care to go into my dealings
with Mrs. Tyson. I have carried out
what I agreed, and if there Is anything
wrong I hope justice will be dealt out
to me. I came up from my southern
ranch about a month ago and these
boys kept after me until they have
landed me. There was no agreement
of marriage. The young man, Ray
Ashberry, who was arrested with me, ;
has absolutely no connection with the
case."
Despite the "Doctor's" denials the
positive statement of Mrs. Tyson made
to Justice* Sandholt of Centerville was
that Proctor had obtained money and
jewelry under promise of marriage.

condition, and the cars are Â£tm down.
The cars and the line will be rebuilt.
The reconstruction of the Alameda line
will be followed by similar work on the
Haywards line, which runs over the
tracks of the Alameda system throu&n
East Oakland. There will then remain
nothing to be rebuilt except the West
Eighth street line, the Twelfth street
line and the-Fourteenth street line.
All of these lines are sadly in need of
work. It has been known that they
were to be reconstructed, and as little
work. has been done upon them as
would permit 'the cars to crawl over the
tracks. ! , '-:>-'.*;-v' '. -~
It is probable that a through system

PLAN TO UNITE
THREE CITIES
Effort of Merchants to Frame
a General Law Permit
ting Division of Counties
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 20.
Effort to consolidate Alameda. Oak
land and Berkeley under one city and
county government is being made by
the Merchants' Exchange of this city
and at a meeting held to-Jilght the
special committee having the matter
in charge reported progress that it ex
pected to have a bill prepared and in
troduced at the next meeting of the
Legislature providing for a general act
that will allow the division of coun
ties. * . . .
The necessity for this action is that
subsequent to the formation. of Glenn,
Riverside and Orange counties the law
was so changed that no county could
again be formed by an act of the Leg
islature except by a general law. The
passage of a general provision is thus
made necessary allowing counties to be
divided. After this is done the way
will be open for the consolidation of the
three cities. A sufficient number of the
residents must, however, become" con
vinced that one government can be
conducted cheaper than a county gov
ernment and a separate city govern
ment for each city.
A general law for the licensing of
automobiles is also beiqg considered by
the exchange and a communication
was sent to the Attorney General ask
ing his advice as to the drawing up of
a proper act. At the present time every
county in the. State has some regula
tion in regard to automobiles, but there
Is no uniformity and no means of iden
tification of an automobile in" case an
ordinance is violated. With a State li
cense office and a number assigned to
the owner of every automobile it is be
lieved that much confusion would be
avoided. v -'." -

honor:
"Out friend Harn^sworth as a
schoolboy was shy and quiet. One
day, to his horror, an inspector called
him up before the class.
. "You appear to be a" clever lad," the
inspector said. "What do five and
one make?"
"The little. fellow made no answer.
""'Come, now,' said the inspector.
'Suppose I gave you five rabbits and
then another rabbit; how many rab
bits would you have?*
- " "Seven/ said Harmsvrorth.
"'How do you make that out?*

home.' "âToledo Blade.

A Terrapin's Memory.
That Br'er Tarrypin has memory is
proved by a story told by Young D.
Hance, who owns the birthplace of
Chief Justice Taney on Battle Creek,
in Calvert County.
. Mr. Hance keeps a small boat under
a mulberry tree on the shore of the
creek and on going to the boat early
one morning he noticed a dry land
terrapin busily engaged in eating a fen
mulberries which had fallen. Mr.
Hance, wishing to assist Br'er Tarrypin
in getting his breakfast, gathered some
mulberries and pitched them to him
one at a time. In a very short time
the terrapin began to catch the berries
in his mouth exactly as they were
thrown to him. Every day afterward
a slight knock on the side of the boat
would bring the terrapin out for hi.s
mulberries and Mr. Hance often look
his friends and visitors to see his pet.
On one occasion a fresh young man
threw a piece of tobacco to the terra
pin instead of a mulberry. Br'er Tar
rypin retired at once In disgust and for
days afterward refused to come when
called. Although Mr. Hance finally In
duced him to come again for his mui
berries, Br'er Tarrypin remembered the
tobacco and would never approach un
less Mr. Hance was alone. â Baltimore

"fading freight for Japan. Offers of

excess cf the means available for trans-
porting it and It was to relieve the
congestion that the Pacific Mail Com
pany chartered the Elleric.
â The Elleric has a carrying capacity of
about C0OO tons. She loaded part of her
cargo in Portland and from here will
take 4500 xpns.
The Elleric will carry only overland
.freight which is being transported from
the cars direct to the steamer. The
fvjrk of. loading the chartered tramp
.will be carried on day and night.
The Mongolia will sail a week from

The liner Mirneeota and an *arthq'jake ar-

- It was mx 7:07 a. ra. that the sleeper* were
aroused br a rutnblinc noise, to the roar of

T. Wnshington Home.
A number of prominent colored men
and women have recently established
a deserving orphanage for children of
their race at 1135 Clay street. The

them.
There are twelve little ones in the
home and the directors are working
hard to enlarge their quarters and
make room for more. Mrs. S. A. Mar^
tin is the president of the board of
directors, and it is mainly through her
efforts and those of T. B. Morton -and
Mrs. Morton that the home has pros
pered. Among the other lady direct
ors who have been working; in the in
terests of the home are Mrs. Lundy,
the secretary; Mrs. J. V. Campbell,
Mrs. Fred Williams. Mrs. Bertha Der
rick, Mrs. Leo Johnson, Mrs. Sarah
Johnson. Mrs. J. S. Francis and Mrs.
Clark.
The directors of the home desire
to express their thanks Xo Mrs. S. A.
Kelley, director of the Needlework
Guild of California, for the able as
sistance which has been rendered. The
directors of the orphanage are pre%
paring lo give the children a Christ
mas party and would be glad to re
ceive donations from all persons in
terested in charitable work.
TROUBLE BREWING OUT
OF RAID ON CHINESE
Police Arrest Yce Gonp on Bench
Warrant nud Action Is Threatened
for False Imprisonment.
There is trouble brewing for the
Polite Department in the arrest of
Yee Gong yesterday by Sergeant El
lis and Policeman Minehan. * An ap
plication will be made for a writ of
habeas corpus for his release by At
torney George D. Collins, who threat
ens to sue the department for false
arrest and imprisonment.
When Police Judge Fritz forfeited
the bail of eighty-three Chinese ar
rested at 820 Washington street at the
time of the raid made by Commission
er Hutton he issued bench warrants
for their arrest. Meantime a writ of
certiorari had been obtained from
Judge Sloss prohibiting Judge Fritz
from taking any further steps against
these Chinese.
The bench warrants were placed in
the hands of Ellis and Minehan and
yesterday two members of the Chinese
Educational Society pointed out Yee
Gong as one of the men. Yee Gong
protested and declared that he was
rot among the eighty-three, but he
was locked up In "the tanks" pending
developments. His i name is not
among the eighty-three and 'Attorney
Collins says he can produce over
whelming testimony to bear out Yee
Gong's statement. Chief Wittman
says he is carrying out the orders of
the court and Judge Fritz, It is said,
disclaims responsibility.

Supervisors Decide Upon a
Plan to Improve Pavement
Fronting Phelan Building
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
arrived at an amicable understanding
yesterday with the F. M. Yorke Com
pany which will insure a vigorous
renewal of the repairs to bituminous
pavements.
Chairman Schmitz of the Board of
Public Works stated that the company
had complained that Inspector Boone
had refused to allow for extra layers of
bitumen and asked that the committee
decide some definite method for com
puting the area of repairs. P. M. Gop
cevlc, a member of the firm, asserted
that Inspector Boone was grossly un
derestimating the amount of work done
and cited an instance where he had al
lowed but $42 70 where six tons of bitu
men had been used on a Market street
block.
Boone stated that he had allowed for
2V4 inches of bitumen although about
four inches had been laid. The com
mittee told Boone that it- was under
stood that he was to report whenever
any extra der>th had been laid. After
some discussion "it was agreed that
Boone would file daily reports of the
b'readths of the patches put down; that
wherever the depth is in excess of 2Vz
inches the inspector shall order it filled
with bitumen and shall give specifically
the data when it is In such excess. The
Yorke Company agreed to go ahead
with the work for a week and another
conference on the subject will be held
on Tuesday, January 2, 1905.
The Finance Committee held a con
ference with Auditor Baehr and it was
agreed to repair the pavement in front
of the " Phelan block and pay for the
same out of the $10,000 appropriation
for street repairs, a proceeding which
yesterday's Call announced would be
done. Bids will be invited for the work,
which it is estimated will cost $2000.
If there should be a deficit In the re
pair fund at the end of the fiscal year
the committee agreed to make it up out
of the urgent necessity fund. The
Mayor consented to this arrangement so
that an eyesore will soon be obliterated.

EIGHT FOUND
DEAD IN RUINS
Victims of the Disaster in
Which Crocker Hotel in
Minneapolis Is Crashed
GUESTS CAUGHT ASLEEP
One Woman Tumbles From
Second Story to Basement,
but Remains in Her Bed
MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 20.â Of the
fourteen people sleeping in the Crocker
Hotel in this city it is now definitely
known, that eiffht were killed this
morning when the walls of the adjoin
ing building fell upon the hostelry. The
sidewall of the O. H. Peck building, in
Fifth street South, which was left
standing by the great fire of last Tues
day night, toppled over in a high gale
onto the hotel, a three-story structure.
The tons of brick and mortar crashed
completely down through the building,
carrying floors and all into a mass of
debris in the basement. There was no
warning of the disaster, and the four
teen persons sleeping in the various
apartments were caught in the crushed
structure.
The dead are: Hans Anderson, em
ployed at Ronner's livery; James Ham
ilton, employed at Ronner's livery: C.
M. Kenvon, foreman Daniels' Linseed
Oil Mill; William Lillyblade. employed
at Daniels' Linseed Oil Mill; Mrs. Jen
nie Murray; William Emmermon, la
borer; William Braa, contractor; Jo
seph Violet, coachman.
The injured are: W. J. Crocker,
badly bruised; Mrs. Carrie Boyce, cut
about face and body; Mrs. Evelyn "Wil
liams, face cut and badly bruised; Mrs.
Anna McNevins. face cut and badly
bruised; Mrs. Maggie McClaire.
Some of those injured were in the
Belmont Hotel, adjoining the Crocker,
and were hurt bv the debris that was
forced through the walls separating the
two buildings.
The persons in the Crocker House
who escaped were Mrs. W. J. Crocker,
wife of the proprietor; Hannah Crock
er, her fifteen-year-old daughter; Wil
lie Crocker, her eight-year-old son;
Baby Williams, 4 months old. her
grandaughter, and Mrs. May Ritchie.
A passerby who heard the crash
promptly turned in a fire alarm and the
department arrived in time to check an
incipient blaze from the wreck, and the
firemen and' policemen at once turned
their attention to rescuing those still
alive and recovering the dead. This
work was carried on under great diffi
culties in the darkness and in the face
of danger from the falling walls.
Mrs. Anna McNevins had a wonder
ful escape. She was on the seoÂ»nd
floor in bed when the crash came. The
firemen took her out of her bed in the
basement. The debris had arched over
her in such a way as to prevent serious
injury.

Propose Street Work.
Supervisor Braunhart stated yester
day that he proposes to submit a plan,
to the Street Committee whereby with
the co-operation of the Board of
Works some of the street improve
ments provided for under the recent
bond issue may be carried out. Braun
hart's scheme is to have the Board of
Works recommend that Mission street
from East to Ninth be widened and
repaved; that Fourth street from
Howard to the bay be sewered, and
that other improvements be recom
mended. It is thought that when the
preliminary proceedings are inaugu
rated no difficulty in disposing of
some of the bonds for street improve
ments will be experienced.

FIXING RAILROAD RATES.
THE carefully qualified recommendation of the President that
the Interstate Commerce Commission be empowered, in certain
cases, to fix railroad rates, has called out a very general dis
cussion. None of those who have been in this general debate seem
to have remembered that the Supreme Court of the United States
has furnished light and instruction upon this interesting and im
portant subject.
In the early stages of public regulation of railroads, when the
matter was in the heat of passion and prejudice, many State Legisla
tures entered upon the business of rate making, with the result that
entirely unworkable laws were passed, that caused more oppression
io the shipper than they did vexation to the roads. As injury to the
railroads was the purpose of the passion in which these laws were
passed, that plan was abandoned and the country entered upon the
second stage of railroad regulation by the creation of executive
commissions for that purpose.
Where these were invested with powers beyond rate making
they proved useful to the railroads and to the people. Such of
them as had visitorial powers to inspect track and structures, build
ings and facilities furnished to shippers proved useful and justified
their creation. But the fixing of rates by such commissions has
proved to be as difficult as the same\ duty was when it was treated
as a legislative function. Many attempts were made and many
failures recorded. Finally, in the Minnesota cases, the right to fix
rates was carried into the courts, and the issue went up the line
to the Supreme Court of the United States. That bench decided
that making rates is dealing with'property rights, with the property
rights of the shipper and of the corporation, and according to the
Federal constitution this can be done only by due process of law.
The court reaffirmed the principle that the only due process of law
is the judicial process, and that no matter where rate making starts,
whether in the freight department of a railroad, or in a State Legis
lature or a State commission, if protested it must come under judicial
_ C V iC \> . â¢
This was a wonderfully illuminating decision. It was the first
r?eful guidance upon the subject that the country has received. It
did not obsolete the rate making power of the Legislature, nor the
delegation of that power to an executive commission, but it erected
the right of appeal from either to the courts for the protection of
the rights of property. Since then we have had but few attempts at
rate making, and the railroads have enjoyed their independence.
Their recent disclosure of the new bill of lading, by which it is in
tended to avoid the liability of common carriers, and transfer the
insurance risk to the shipper, is evidence that independence long
enjoyed is subject to abuse, and the President's recommendation calls
to the front the old issue of rate making and public supervision, di
rected at that point where public interests are most affected by rail
road policy. â
An examination of the whole subject, in a business temper and
without prejudice, discloses a few poinefc of friction and a few princi
ples of adjustment. No one will dispute that the skill and expe
rience required in rate making and classification are hard to find
outside of the freight departments of railroads. The history of
public rate making furnishes many examples of injury to one class
of shippers while trying to conserve the interests of another class.
The long war between the long and short haul rate is an instance
of this. But when a rate infringes the rights of a shipper, it is his
property right that suffers and he must seek judicial protection.
Here appears the advantage of the railroad. The individual
shipper must challenge it alone in the courts.. Against its resources
in litigation he must put his, the man against the Corporation. From
the court of first instance on up the steep and stony path of appeal
be must maintain the unequal struggle. As a rule he falls and quits
in the court of original jurisdiction, and surrenders the property
right involved rather than persist in getting it judicially vindi
cated.
Now the suggestion of all this is plain. The Congress is em
powered by the constitution to create inferior courts and define and
limit their jurisdiction. The conversion of the Interstate Commerce
Commission into such a bench will carry out the President's recom
mendation and the decision of the Supreme Court in regard to the
<Jue process of law. That commission, clothed with judicial powers,
made a court of first instance for use by shippers and railroads,
should have its procedure so defined that no delay can occur to em-
barrass and exhaust the individual litigant. There should be no
change of forum or venue permitted, and none of the other dilatory
technicalities of procedure. The complaint against a rate should be
filed as a petition for relief. The answer should be compulsory within
a fixed limit. When it is made the issue should be promptly joined
and tried upon the facts, and the entering of the decree should be as
prompt as is consistent with justice. The plaintiff could in his
petition impeach the rate that he attacks and declare that which he
regards as reasonable and just. The defendant corporation would
in rejoinder impeach the rate he proposed and by testimony vindi
cate its own. The decree, then, of necessity, establishes a rate, by
judicial process, and fulfills the President's suggestion, while judi
cially safeguarding the rights of property.
This removes the objection to putting the. rate question in the
hands of a political body like the Interstate Commerce Commission
as now constituted. The judicial commission would be soon recog
nized as an impartial body, unmoved by prejudice and impervious to
passion, seeking to do justice by applying the principles of legal
analysis and construction to an issue that affects every article of
commerce produced by the people for profit and consumed by the
people for the support of life. In such a court the individual suitor
could appear fearlessly. The provisions against the law's delay
would make him equal in right and privilege and power to all the
railroads of the country in combination, and it would not be neces
sary for him to lose in the costs of litigation that property he defends
by appeal to the law.
In our jurisprudence it has come to pass that property rights
have largely been consigned to equity for protection, because in a
large area covered by those rights the law is inadequate. So it may
come to pass that this court will be largely an equity court, and
from its decisions there will be few appeals. It should be a bench
before which a railroad is just as sure of equity as is an individual.
This matter of regulation of railways has gone through its
legislative and executive stages without settlement. It has taken
two steps forward from the position in which the Dartmouth College
decision planted the rights of property held by public franchise.
They have been steps forward in fact, and not merely, in number.
They were evolutionary, and like the development on judicial lines
*>f all interests in this country, they have intended respect for all
rights without unequal advantage to any. To put the issue at the
angle of repose one more step has been necessary. The, country
could not go on forever with the railroads appealing to the courts as
in the Texas cases, from a rate fixed by a Legislature or by an
executive commission. Nor could the situation much longer bear
the strain of an Interstate Commerce Commission invested, only
with the power of discovery, and divested of the right of remedy by
enforcement of its judgments. A forward movement was essential.
The President has defined it. Now let us move forward and put
the issue in the hands of equity and settle it by due process of, law.

PORT ARTHUR'S
AMAZON SLAIN
The Novy Krai of November 12 con
tains a romantlo Btory of a Russian,
Haritent Korotklewitch, who, although
a woman, served with valor ln^ many
fights till death closed her strange ca
reer. The Novy Krai gives numerous
details, which render the authenticity
of the story undoubted.
Her husband was serving in Port
Arthur, and, endeavoring to rejoin him,
she was stopped at Harbin and not al
lowed to proceed, on the ground that
6he was a woman. She thereupon don
ned masculine attire and reached Port
Arthur shortly before the landing of
the Japanese. She soon found her hus
band's regiment and enlisted in It. She
participated in numerous sorties and
helped in the defenses of Corner Hill.
Although her sex was soon discovered,
her record for bravery and tlrelessness,
and attention to the wounded, won her
permission to remain in the ranks.
Her husband fell wounded while fight
ing by her side. She nursed him
through the critical moments of his
illness and then returned to the front,
where she became a messenger to Cap
tain Gouzakofsky, of the Thirteenth
Regiment, riding fearlessly to and from
the various positions, unaffected by the
din and danger of battle.
On October 16, when visiting the
trenches with dispatches, a huge shell
struck and destroyed the earthworks,
killing her and eight others. They were
buried in one grave, with a flag around
her body.
The Novy Krai concludes by saying
that she had won the respect and ad
miration not only of the soldiers, but
also of the higher officers, and had
shown all how to die nobly. â London

BEYOND THE DEPOT
THE stranger stopped and cour
teously lifted his hat.
"Can you direct me â " he be
gan, then broke off to remark:
"You're in trouble. Can I help
you?"
The girl dabbed hastily at her eyes.
"No, no, no!" And then, an arch
look sparkling up at him from under
the rainbow of her wet lashes, "Un
less you can prevent my stepmother
from taking boarders!"
A quizzical responsiveness flashed
into his keen eyes. He put down
his suit case and wiped his hot fore
head. The grassy bank by the road
side where the girl sat looked rest
fully tempting.
"I've never been 1 called upon to ex
ercise my powers of persuasion or
intimidation in that particular re
spect," he assured her gravely. "I
might try, though. Do you mind if
I sit down a few moments while you
state the case in its entirety?" .
She knew he was laughing at her,
and she laughed too. She , switched
her pink dimity skirts closer, which
is a woman's way of giving permis
sion.
He tossed his Panama hat on the>
b'ank and sat down beside her. He
looked long and lithe. His features
were irregular, and there was. a tinge
of red in his straight brown hair. But
his gray eyes were handsome, " and
had laughter-loving lines about them.
"And why does this presumably
estimable woman insist on taking
boarders? And what kind of boarders
honor her establishment? And â why
do you object?"
"One question at a time, if you
please," she ordained . demurely.
"Well, why does she take board
ers?"
"In the hope that some one of them
will marry Harriet." ." / â â -.
"And who Is Harriet?"
"Her daughter." pMlji
"Oh! And do none of the â the In*
dividuals honored by such a hope re
ciprocate her ambition?"
His companion wistfully contem
plated'the tip of her shoe.
"No," she sighed. "Not one, so far."
"And why?" he asked..
"Because," she confessed!, forlornly,
"they fall in love with me!" i
"All of them?" he exclaimed, r.yi
She flashed on him a battery- of
dusk brilliant eyes."
"Why not?" she counter-qunestioned.
"Ah, very true!" acknowledged "the
young man. "They * couldn't help
themselves, I'm sure. Poor devils!"
"Don't ;waste any pity on them," she
advised coolly. . . â 
"I don't, really. I'm thinking of the
next victim. _ You Bee in the midst of
life we areâ or are apt to beâ In love!"
She laughed, swinging her pink sun
bonnet by the strings.
"But you haven't told me," he went
on, "what kind 'the boarders are."
She made a comical little grimace and
shook her head.
"Assorted ages, sizes, professions â
â what dry goods men call a job lot.
But they're all distinctly eligible. .Mrs.

An odd smile crept around his mouth.
"And how many are there at the

UNKISSED at-the age of 70 years,
Eli Richardson went to his grave
last week, says the Martin (Tenn.)
correspondent â¢ of the Philadelphia
North American.
It had been Richardson's boast
through life that he had never put his
lips to a woman's, although. he marj
ried for love and "lived happily ever
afterward."
His disdain for osculation hung on a
pin.
An incident at a social held in the
South before the Civil War led him to
eschew, the joys of woman's lips for
life. A game was being played by the
guests in which the young women had
to forfeit a kiss to her captor.
Young Richardson's timidity being
known, a plot was laid to get him to
kiss a girl." She placed a pin in her
mouth, and when Eli's bashful lips
were to press hers she was to prick his
lips with the pin.
The fateful moment came. Eli de
murred, but was prevailed upon to
yield to temptation.
He started to implant the kiss, but
his eye caught the gleam of the pin
and he refused. From that day until
his death he never kissed a woman.

She looked down at the slim, pink
fingers idly swaying the sunbonnet,
and again shook her head.
"Rut the others?" he prompted.
"Oh, two of them are very far gone
indeed!" she replied briskly. "And
Harlow's coming."
He saw the corners of her lips
twitch suspiciously.
"You seem to have diagnosed their

grimly.
She disclaimed credit with an airy

"Oh, that's nothing when you're used

demanded.
"You've never seen â¢' Harriet, or you
wouldn't ask. Oh! Here she comes!

IS THERE LIFE
ON THE MOON?
It has been said that* carbonic acid
gas may be vomited from the moon's
craters, besides water vapor. So slight
is the attraction of the moon for other
bodies that oxygen must escape from
its surface with much the same rapid
ity as hydrogen escapes from the
earth. By reason of Its heaviness car
bonic acid gas, however, must cling
to the moon with great tenacity â a
circumstance that is of the utmost im
portance to the astronomers who have
given us the new moon. Carbonic acid
gas is the food of plants on the earth.
IÂ«j it possible that it may nurture re*e
tation on the moon?
It happens that at times there may
be observed on the moon areas what
Professor Pickering â by whom they
have been most closely studied â has
termed "variable spots," because they
darken very rapidly after sunrise and
gradually disappear toward sunset.
They cannot be caused by shadows:
for shadows would be at least visible
when " the sun is directly overhead.
They appear most quickly at the equa
tor and invade the higher altitudes
after a lapse of a few days. In the
polar regions they have never been
seen. What are they? Organic life
resembling vegetation, answer Profes
sor Pickering and his adherents â
vegetation that nourishes luturiantly
while the sun shines and withers when
night falls. Given a plane/ on which
the temperature probably never rises
above .the melting point of ice, on
which Vater vapor and carbonic acid
gas are discharged by volcanoes, is
there anything in the nature of things
why vegetation should not exist? It
has been pointed out that certain
lichens grow in regions of the earth
where the temperature never rises
above the freezling point. The intense
cold of the moon is therefore not a con-,
elusive objection against the flourish
ing plant life. A single day, it may be
urged, is not sufficiently long for the
development and decay of vegetation;
but sixteen hours on the moon are lit
tle more than half an hour on the
earth; a day lasts half a month, and
may well be regarded as a miniature
season. The absence of storms on
the moon and the fact that a branch
would be urged upward with but one
sixth the. effort required on the earth,
are inestimable , advantages of this
mooted lunar vegetation over ter
restrial plant life. â Waldemar B.
Kaempffert, in the December Book

When she had disappeared there was
the glimmer of a pink gown. Maureen
ran down into the path.
"I must go home, I suppose. There's
the new man's room to put in order.
My stepmother has no need to take
boarders. Papa left her well off. But
she thinks it's the only way to get Har

The traveler sprang up and lifted his
suit case.
"She'd have a better chance that,"
he averred positively, "if she'd do
something else first."
"What's that?" They were walking
along the tree-embowered way to
gether. "' 'j . 7
"Exile â banish â annihilate you!"
She laughed gayly. "Oh, I'm not
really formidable in that respect. For
I don't intend to get married."
"Not ever?" he queried, leaning for
ward that he might look into the small,
serious face. '. ,
"Oh, perhaps, when I'm very old â
twenty-nine or thirty; not before!" she
decided resolutely, t "And only then

"Wait a minute. I don't see what

marked irrelevantly.
Eyes, dimples and smiles all daz

"I don't know either," she admitted.

For he was keeping right on by her

CHIEF WITTMAN
DENIES RUMOR
Story That He Anticipates
Being Ousted Is Branded
an Absolute Falsehood
qjOXGUES' AEE WAGGING
Many Who Pretend to Know
Say That the Department
WiU Have Another Head
Rumors of changes in the Police De
partment are rife simw the findings of
the Commissioners on the Chinatown
scandal were given out. One of the
rumors that found credence yesterday
was that Chief Wlttman. was to be
ousted. Later a story waa circulated
that Wutxaan had admitted to friends
that be anticipated such u fate.
The Chief denounces this story as a
falsehood. "1 have nothing to be afraid
of," he said. '"The statement that I "an
ticipate being ousted is utterly ab
surd. Of course, there Is no police
force that is infallible, but I think that
1 have raised the San Francisco depart
rarai to a standard of efficiency as
high as that of any city in the coun
try."
When asked why the Commissioners
had not voted to specifically exonerate
the Chief, as they had the Mayor and
A. Ruef in connection with the China
town scandal. Commissioners Drink
house and Reagan said: "We do not
think that the Police Department has
cleared itself. There was gambling in
Chinatown and It was permitted to go
on."
"The Chief Is responsible for his men,
isn't her" remarked Commissioner
Reagan. "We will know more after the
trial â¢ We will deal with the men at
that time. Other matters are for the
Grand Jury to investigate."
In regard to this statement Chief
Wlttman said: "My bonds do not guar
antee the integrity of all the men on the
force. If I am to be held responsible
for the honesty of each and every po
liceman under me I would have a big
contract on my hands. There is noth
ing in my conduct as Chief of Police
that needs defense. I stand on my rec
ord."
Commissioner Hutton declined to
make a statement regarding his atti
tude toward the Chief. Commissioner
Howell reiterated the statement that
he saw nothing in the evidence offered
to show that any official or citizen of
the city was receiving corruption
money from Chinatown gamblers.
None of the Commissioners seems to
care to discuss the stories of the pro
posed removal of the Chief. The ru
mors, however, came fast. The "real
inside of the whole thing" was spread
by numerous gossipers, who were as
thick as tramps at a lunch counter. Dr.
George I. Drucker and J. George Boyne
were mentioned as "sure things" for
the vacancy to be made by the expira
tion of Commissioner Howell's term in
January. The button-hole information
bureaus also had numerous appointees
for the position of Chief of Police. Va
rious whisperers who 'had it straight"
appointed Commissioner Hutton. Cap
tain Martin and Captain Gleason. And
the tongues are still wagging of
changes to be made and dark horses,
to be appointed.
. Jt is stated^, on what appears to be
good authority, that George Maxwell,
former secretary of the Fire Commis
sioners. will~*ucceed Bert Cadwalader
as secretary of the Police Commission
ers. It is claimed that this was decided
upon when Cadwalader announced that
he would resign.
The three sergeants and five patrol
men' charged with receiving tribute
from the corruption fund of the Chi
r.ese gamblers will be on the stand to-
night. The charges are now up to them
to" disprove, as the findings of the Com
missioners absolve those higher in civic
authority and place the accusation
apaiRFt the Police Department- The
men who must face investigation are:
Sergeants Ellis, Fraher and Brophy,
and Patrolmen C. E. Munn. R. R.
O'Brien. H. T. McGrath, Henry Heinz
ami William Doran of the Chinatown
squad.
Â«
VSPIRAXTS IX>R POSITIONS.
The complications arising out of the
probable appointments have become
tcmewhat tangled owing: to Civil Ser
vice Commissioner Ropers informing
the Mayor that he would appreciate a
rcappointment until such tiine as he
cecides to assume some Federal po
sition. The Mayor feel? that ht ought
to reappoint Rogers, in view of thÂ» fact
that if he did not it would give his de
tractors an opportunity to say that
Rogers had deserted his standard. If
Rogers Is reap;Â»ointed it will be tenv
rorarily. and David J. Oliver will suc
ceed him.
It is said by the wise ones that pr.
Joseph Poheim,' a member of /th'-
Poard of Health, has aspirations and
will be named as Fire Commissioner
should Boyne sret the Police Commis-
Bionership. Then, again, David J.
Oliver mipht stand some chance there
fince Rogers' reappointment will shut
h!m out of the Civil Service Cornmis-
Eionership, although for a temporary
period only. The complications might
prevent the reappointment of Elec
tion Commissioner Voorsanger. 2>ut
that 13 not considered probable.
Now that Works Commissioner Ca-
Bey seems to be out of the run
ning for reappointment, according to
the Slayer's own declaration, the gos-
Bips are centering on the .name of
Thomas F. Egan as Casey's successor.
Epan has been mentioned for the place
teveral times in the past wh*n there
waa a vacancy on the board, but with
out any result in his favor. His name
this time, however, will not down. He
is at present storekeeper of the Board
of Education, and if he is decided upon
for advancement it is said that John G.
Fitzgerald will be named as store
keeper.

SCORING WORDS
BY McENERNEY
Takes Johnson to Task for
Aspersions on Witnesses
Who Belong to "Society"
CONTEST LACKS PROOF
No Evidence at All to Show
Miss Dolbeer Was Insane
When She Made Her Will
Garret W. McEnerney began argu
ment for the proponents in the Dolbeer
will case after Hiram Johnson had fin
ished his' opening address in behalf of
the contestant yesterday morning.
Johnson once more started a flood of
perspiration in animadverting on the
"society people" who testified as
witnesses in support -of Bertha. Dol
beer's last will and testament, and
another collar was consigned to
the laundry-bag, wilted and flat
tened ' where the chin beat tattoos In
impassioned appeal, but mute evidence
of the flre of words that thrilL
When it came McKnerney's turn, Mr.
Johnson himself became the object of
oratorical castigation. The "Ignoble
appeal to passion," "the fanning of
prejudice," as TtfcEnerney sahl hl8 op
ponent had resorted to by holding up
the witnesses for the proponents as un
worthy because of their wealth and
their standing, were unsparingly de
nounced.
"Such has been Mr. Johnson's man
ner of trial of this case," declared Mc-
Enerney, and his abundant shock of
hair shook to the routs with his ear
nestness. "And when in this country
of ours," he continued, "appeal can be
successful to the prejudices of race, of
religion, of class, of wealth and its dis
tinction, then is the beginning of the
end of our institutions as a nation.
Next to the arrogance of wealth is the
malignant hatred of the poor for the
rich. It is this prejudice of the poor
against the rich that Mr. Johnson has
sought to arouse in the minds of this
jury."
QUOTES FROM {'SIMPLE L.1FE."'
McEnerney brought President Roose
velt and Rev. Charles Wagner into the
case, and quoted freely from "The Sim
ple Life" in his scorings of the "ignoble
appeal" of contestant's counsel.
The oratory of the counsel for pro
ponents continued till the hour of ad
journment, and he will resume this
morning. The following was McEner
ney's address in part.
Th<?re is but one question and only one In
this case. Was Bertha Marion Dolbeer of un.
&ound mind when sne executed her will on
April 2j cf the present year?
The health of the testatrix before that time
and after that time are subsidiary questions.
By insinuation and innuendo counsel for con
testant has sought to make it appear that Etta
Marion Warren exerted an Influence over Miss
l>oibeer and dictated the terms or the instru
ment. But there was no such J**ue raised in
tins contest, and counsel unjustifiably encages
in vagus possibilities anj probabilities, His
whole case abounds in the figment!! of his
imagination.
It it established law that all persons are
presumed to be sane. The writing of a co
herent will itself Is evidence of the
soundness of the testator's mind. The
burden of proof is on the' cont'sUni
to show that Bertha Dolbeer was insane on
April 23. I will call your attention to the fact
that the contestant has not produced a single
witness who. could tell of her mental condition
on that day. Absolutely nothing was proved
tending In* any degree to show that her mind
was unbalanced when ehe signed her testa
ment. The testimony of Mr*. J. L. Moody,
Mrs. Ray Sherman and Mrs. Elizabeth C. Phil
lips is the sum total of tlwlr case. Against the
testimony of Bertha Wilcoxen, the nurse; Dena
Kagmussen, the maid. Joseph Ba*r and Ma
dame Baer of the dressmaking parlors; Mary
KaulkJier. the titter. Leslie Elfendahl. the
chauffeur; A. P. Sutton. the actor; Pierce W.
Moorehouee. the ticket broker, and Addison <*.
Mizner of New York, all of whom testified that
they saw Bertha Dolbeer on April 23, con
versed with her and fcund her rational and
Fane, the confstant has not produced one* Wit
neFs to contradict or show that *he was not of
sound mind. ,
Jn addition to the witnesses that have been
nar&ed the proponents have called many friends
and acquaintances, but not one of them ever
entertained the slightest suspicion of a falling
mind. It is well established in jurisprudence
and in experience that testimony based on such
observation of friends and acquaintances is
the best evidence possible as to sanity cr in
sanity.
ILL HEALTH XO FACTOR
The contestant has striven energetically to
make it appear that Bertha Do'beer wan In
!JJ health. What evidence is that of an un
sound mind? The great majority of wills are
made on the sickbed, and it would be a radical
departure from the principles that obtain to
baÂ»e a contest on the ground of mental In
competency with no further evidence to sup
port it than the ill health of the person who
made the v.iii.
McEnerney explained that if the will
is broken the estate, by the law of suc
cession, will go to Adoiph Schander. the
contestant; his brother, Horatio Schan
der, and his sister, Mrs. J. L. Moody,
who were brothers and sisters of Mrs.
Dolbeer, the mother of the testatrix.
They are the nearest of kin, there being
no relatives on the father's side closer
than cousins, whom the law would ig
nore. Never since the death of Mrs.
Dolbeer in 1S79 had Adoiph Schander
ever crossed the threshold of John Dol
beer's home. Neither had Mrs. Moody
ever been a visitor at the Dolbeer home
since 1879, until the funeral of Bertha
Dolbeer. Nor did Adoiph Schander or
Mrs. Moody, according to the evidence
in the case, ever speak to John Dolbeer
after the death of his wife; they would
pass him on the street without showing
him a sign of recognition. Continuing,
McEnerney said:
And yet. these people, the contestant and bin
elstcr, contend that the will Js unnatural In
that there were no bequests for them not
withstanding they had been strangers to
Bertha Doibeer's father for twenty-five rears
Fred Moody declared to Douglas WaUon that
the estate waÂ» none of his pie because he knew
of the relations that had existed and there
fore did not reasonably expect that his mother
would be remembered in the testament.
Moody's judgment was the natural conclusion
and just as be thought was right Miss Dolbeer
did net leave a bequest to his mother or his
uncles, the two Schanders.
Indeed, think of the irony of fate If John
Dolbeer should sleep his sleep of death In
Crpress Lawn Cemetery with the sufferance of
these three people, to care for his grave. They
despised him In life and In life he had no
love for them. Why should It bÂ« that those who
were dearest and nearest to him in life should
not enjoy the fruits of the fortune he had
built up when such was his expressed wish
and such was the wish cf the daughter to
whom his estate had descended?
In general outline Bertha Dolbeer used the
form of her father's. will. The dominant fcR
tures in th? two Instruments are the same. He
was actuated by affection for those of kin and
for those, who labored for him. Miss Warren
he mentioned as **Â» member of his family,"
and Hft her $25,000. This woman, "who was
brought op from abject poverty." to use the
language of counsel for contestant, was* re
ferred to affectionately as "m. member of my
family." Though there was no tie of blood
she had acquired a stronger tie of relationship
by far than that of the Schandera and Mrs.
Moody.
Bertba Dolbeer â  exhibited the same senti
ments as did her father. ShÂ» made a number
of identical leracles. William O. Mucan and
George D. Gray, who were named as executors
by the father, were appointed to similar ca
pacity by the daughter. It was plain on the
facÂ« of the will itself that Bertha Dolbeer in
telligently and. sanely disposed of her estate.
GUARDIAN- FOR BAIRD.â Judg* Coffey
yesterday appointed Veronica C Balrd guard -

man was in court and offered no opposition.
Attorney Heggerty, for Ruth Jackson Balrd.

her tmpport, but it was stated that Balrd's
estate was so Involved that It was Impossible
to determine what allowance could bÂ« made.

OLSON HOUSES
MEET DISASTER
Creditors Take Charge and
Prepare to Investigate
Their Financial Standing
DEBTS ARE $105,000
Assets Consists of : Stocks
of Goods and Leases in
This City aiid Oakland
Olson Bros., Incorporated, of this
city and the Olson Company of San
Francisco and Oakland are in financial
trouble. The liabilities of the two
concerns are about $105,000, the assets
of unknown value. Henry Olson is
reported Xo have - rated the - assets at
$100,000, on the basis of stocks of
gooda estimated at $60,000, leases at
(25,000 and sood will at $15,000. ThÂ«
leading men in, both concerns are
bi others.
The creditors seriously doubt the ac
curacy of Henry Olson's valuation of
the assets. Just what' the. difference
between the assets and Uu biHties is
will probably not ,be determined in
less than a week or ten days. A meet
ing of the creditors of Doth houses
was held yesterday, and a committee
was appointed to investigate. , This
committee consists 'of F. A. Hilmer of
the firm of Hilmer & Bredhoff; I, I.
Brown of the City and County Bank;
George s. Wheaton oi Wheaton,' Pond
& Harrold; H. P. Capell of M. J.
LJrundenstein & Co. and R. McKinnon
Of the Uiiion National Bank ot Oak
land.
The creditors had intimation some
days ago that there was trouble ahead.
The tirst meeting of the creditors was
held last Sunday. At that time it was
understood that an Oakland grocery
man would agree to guarantee 50
cents on the dollar of the liabilities of
the? Olsons and finance their business,
but this proposition was withdrawn.
Accordingly Henry Olson, the leading
man of the several Olson brother?,
had the creditors called together yes
terday and appeared with his brothers
and Herbert Choynski, their attorney.
The entire forenoon and much of the
alternoon was consumed. At the end
of the -proceed ings Henry Olson maoe
a statement for all the parties con
cerned In the Olson Company and the
Ol^on Bros.
The substance of this was that some
six months or so ago his brothers, who
had been connected in business with
him, decided to start for themselves
and they opened a store in this city
on Market street. He assisted them
with loans. Business did not turn out
as well as the Olson brother^ had ex
pected and they were unable to meet
bills a3 they fell due. The liabilities
outstanding of the Olson Company are
? 50.000 â and those of the Olson Bros,
about $55,000 to $56,000. Henry Ol
son claimed to have no connection
with Olson Bros, as a member of that
tirm, which is incorporated.
The largest creditor of the Ofton
Company is the Union National Bank
of Oakland, which loaned $15,000 to
the company. The City and County
Bank is concerned in the failure of the
Olsons to the amount of $8000. Many
houses dealing in dairy products,
groceries, provision.-*, meat and general
market supplies are interested more
or less as creditors. Hilmer & Bred
hoff are creditors to the amount of
about $6500*. as reported. Among the
creditors are Dodge, Sweeney & Co.,
who have a claim of $2300; Pond.
AYheaton &. Harrold to the amount of
JSSOO: Harris Bros, of SpeÂ»ir street
to the reported amount of $9000; H.
N. Tilden & Co. of 211 Sacramento
street, the amount not being stated.
JStllerbaeh & Sons and Haas Bros, are
also in the list. It is reported and also
disputed that Henry Olson has held
Si per cent of the stock of Olson Bros.
This is denied by Henry Olson.
All the property of the Olsons was
turned' over yesterday .to F. A. Hilmer,
chairman of the creditors' committee,
for thp benefit of the creditors. This
consists principally of the stocks of
goods in the market at 911 Market
street and the stores at 831 Market
street and at Ninth and Washington
streets in Oakland. The leading men
in the Olson Company are Henry
Olson, president, and H. B. Hankin
son, secretary. The principal stock
holder? in Olson Bros, are N. P. Olson
and J. M. Olson. An inventory will be
tnken as soon as possible, following
which the creditors' committee will
call another meeting and make a
statement.
Speaking of the situation last night
Mr. Hilmer said: "The creditors be

OVEELOOK HIS JEWELEY
Dazed Man Staggers Into a
Turk Street Lodging-House
and Falls Unconscious
Dudley Waltz, a wealthy sheep man
from Chico, was given knockout drops
and robbed of $200 early yesterday
evening. The robbed man staggered
in a semi-conscious condition into
the hall of the Belmont lodging-housÂ«

he was taken to the Central Emerg
ency Hospital.
Shortly : after" 7 o'clock last night
Waltz was Been to stagger into the
lodging-house and there he fell in a
heap In the hall. He was picked up
by one of the roomers and cared for.
Policeman O'Brien was notified and
he and Detective O'Day made an in
vestigation.
At the hospital the sheep man re
gained consciousness and said that he
had 5200 on his person when he start
ed out yesterday afternoon. He had
evidently been drinking considerable
and Dr. Millar said that he believed
the man was given knockout drops.
Waltz said that he had been with a
friend named Jim Murphy. He be
lieves that he was given knockout
drops and cannot explain why Mur
phy deserted him.
The last Waltz remembers was that
he took a drink In a Turk-street sa

When Waltz was searched at the
hospital he had a check on the Â«Bank

BRITT SAYS HE WAS PREPARED.

and an aggressive man. but I think I could have outsluszed
him if I cared about fighting that land or a battle. My
friends had their money on me and I wanted them to cash, so
I took no chances. Xclson is a jjreat fijrhter and the pace

a yell was forthcoming, and when a
lively mixup occurred the majority
stood on their chairs and yelled like

The doors were opened at 7 o'clock to

"I declared Britt winner because he was entitled to the
decision. He did the cleaner fighting and outpointed Xcl

the other man does the cleaner hitting. Britt and Xelson
were equally guilty of holding. I had my hands full try
ing to separate them and did not attempt to give either
man the better of it in the breaks. A few wild swings
landed on me I never saw such speed and cleverness as
Britt displayed. lie is a great boy. Xclson is also a won
der for aggressiveness. "Where he gets his vitality is a mar
vel to me. I would like to see the winner fight Young
Corbett. provided Corbett is in condition. I am glad the
public approved my decision. It was an honest one and
was given to the man that earned it." â Referee William
Roche.
BRITT'S CLEVERNESS
OFFSETS MANX RUSHES
Victor Is in Distress Several Times
Dut rinisnes otrongly.
Jimmy Britt was proclaimed victor
over Battling Nelson in the Mechanics'
pavilion last night after one of the
most stubbornly contested ring battles
ever fought under Queensberry rules.
Referee Roach gave the decision to
Britt on boxing points, the last three
rounds materially influencing him In
reaching this decision. In these rounds
Britt outpointed Nelson by a wide mar
gin. Throughout the figltf he did the
cleaner hitting, although the referee
said he made due allowance for the ag
gressiveness shown by Nelson. Britt
outboxed Nelson from the start and
was able to go the full twenty rounds
by refusing to engage Nelson at his
favorite game of infighting.
- BRITT HOLDS ON.
In the eariy rounds Britt drewi-upon
himself the displeasure of the specta
tors by holding on at every oppor
tunity. He showed great ring general
ship throughout, never once losing his
head even at the most critical times.
It was an entirely different showing
to the one he made against Gans, or
In fact any of his other fights. The
fight demonstrated that Britt cannot
knock Nelson out, as he struck him re
peatedly on the jaw with both left and
right. /
In the twelfth round Britt fairly
rained blows on Nelson's head, but the
latter stood looking at him calmly, as
though he knew, there was no danger
of his being knocked out. When he
thought Britt had ehot his bolt he
turned on the Californian and nearly
put him out. having him' hanging on
the ropes when the gong sounded the
end of the round.
Nelson won the admiration of the
spectators by his bulldog tenacity of
purpose. There was hardly a moment
during the fight when he was not fol
lowing Britt around the ring. He made
many futile attempts to reach Britt,
but in the majority of cases the latter
was just out of reach.
TRIES FOR POINTS.
From the very start it was apparent
that Britt's plan was to try to out
point Nelson and thereby gain the de
cision and the long end of the purse.
He did not want to mix matters with
his clumsy but aggressive opponent, as
Corbett did. thus playing Into his
hand*:. Nelson's aggressiveness did not
serve its purpose, as in many instances
Britt beat him to the punch.
During a number of the rounds Britt
had Nelson in the air and the latter
did not know how to get at him. Up
to the seventh round Nelson had not
landed an effective blow, although he
was never Idle for an instant in all
that time. Britt seemed to tire about
the eighth round and Nelson went
after him in such a manner as to set
the spectators cheering, and hope
sprang up in the breasts of the
men who backed the longshot to win.
Nelson In the seventh round sent a
right to the Jaw which seemed to hurt
Britt. He went after his man then
hammer and tongs and Britt was badly
off before the end of the round. The
tide turned so suddenly that it seemed
Britt had lost his strength and must
fall a victim to the ceaseless rushing
of the Dane.
NELSON'S ROUND.
The ninth round was all Nelson's.
He rushed at Britt when the gong
sounded and landed his left repeatedly
to Britt's head, using his favorite left
hook. Britt steadied Nelson for a mo
ment with a right to the head, but Nel
son came back with right and left.
Britt tried to Jab Nelson and keep him
away, but. the Dane was not to be de
nied. He kept pepjjering Britt on the
jaw with his left and then for variety
sent in some stiff right uppercuts.
The tenth was all in favor of Nelson.
He still continued to send Etiff left
hooks to Britt's head. Britt came
back with some hard rights to the
head, but they had no apparent effect
on Nelson, never stopping his progress.
Nelson rushed Britt into Nelson's cor
ner and chopped in aright that made
Britt s knees bend. He then tried rieht
and left to the head and a hard rieht to
the body sent Britt staggering to the
ropes. As the round ended Nelson sent
in a stiff uppercut before Britt started
to his corner. He stood for an Instant
and looked at Nelson in evident sur
prise.
in the eleventh round Britt
held Nelson's gloved hands In chancery
and accomplished two objectsâ getting
a slight respite from the severe punish
ment he had been receiving and also
resting up a bit.
JIMMY BRACES UP.
Britt showed; the effects of the rest
in the next round, as he made a 1 much
better showing. He would jab Nelson
with a left and then rush" into a clinch
and hang on. Nelson-tried all In hie

THE SAN : FRANCISCO CALL, -WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER; 21, 1904.
DECISION SURPRISES NELSON.
"I am not the sort of fellow to make a holler, but at
the same time I want to put myself right. I really believe
I was unjustly treated by Roche. I chased Britt all over
the ring: in every, round and fought every moment of the
time. I never was in danger and took all his punches
without flinching. The best he did was to jab me. I
roughed it continuously and did everything In my power to
fight a winning battle. I am willing to meet Britt again
under exactly the same conditions, only I positively insist
.on George Slier as a 'referee. I think he is the only man
in the business who really knows how to judge a fight on
its merits. I am willing to fight Britt again for a $5000
side bet. hut not with Roche in the ring with us. I will
knock Brilt out if we ever come together again."-âBat
tling Xclson.
which redueed.his effectiveness in such
a marked degree, but for a time to no
avail. Britt finally turned loose a ter
rific fire on kelson's head. He aimed
blow after blow with right and left
that went true to the mark.
Nelson stood peering at Britt over
his gloves and the blows might just as
well have fallen on a stone wall. Nel
son suddenly got into action and went
after Britt, who seemed on the verge
of going down when the gong ended
the fighting. Britt came up confident
in the thirteenth round and commenced
peppering Nelson's nose, which began,
to bleed badly. During one of the mix
ups Nelson slipped to the floor, but he
was up and fighting in an instant.
â¢' soSie 'fast "fighting.
Britt presented a gory appearance
from the fourteenth round on. Nel
son butted him over the left eye as he
rushed in at the opening of the round
and cut Britt severely. Nelson kept
on playing with his left to the head,
but could not land an effective blow.
Britt hooked his left over repeatedly
and kept Nelson's nose bleeding.
Britt tired again in the fifteenth
round from a fusillade of blows to the
head. He came back with a right and
left, but Nelson paid no heed to them
and continued to bore in. Britt ducked
one of Nelson's wild swings and over
balanced himself, falling on his back.
He was up In an mstant and Nelson
went after him, trying to take him off
his balance again. One ,of Nelson's
blows went low and nearly stopped
Eritt.
The sixteenth round was the most
desperate of all the fight. Nelson
sprang from his chair and fairly ran
across the ring after Britt. His Im
petuous attack sent Britt back on the
ropes and Nelson landed a right and
left to the i head which shook up Britt
badly. Britt backed away for a time
and then they stood in the "middle of
the ring and exchanged blow for blow.
It seemed some one of them must eo
down under the attack; the bell rang
with both men still on their feet fight
ing.
THE DAXE RUSHES.
Nelson rushed at Britt again at the
opening of the seventeenth round and
Britt held on to avoid punishment.
Britt sent in one hard right to the head,
but took a lot of lefts to the head In
return. Britt shook up Nelson with a
right and left to the head, and tried to
wrestle him to the mat.
Britt went back to his boxing tac
tics in the eighteenth round and danced
out of danger for some time. He found
it difficult as he had all through the
fight to keep away from Nelson and
got some hard lefts to the head. Britt
also tore a left to the body and a right
to the head that would have stopped
any ordinary fighter, but' Nelson is not
an ordinary fighter. The adherents of
the two boxers set up counter cries for
their favorites and the building re
sounded with the names of Britt and
Nelson. ."â ;â .
Britt evidently was playing for a de
cision In the nineteenth round, in the
early stages of which he did everything
except fight. Nelson finally walked
into a hard right, and as Britt was
backing away he landed another right.
Nelson then walked into a hard right
straight on the jaw, but he only shook
his head and kept boring In. Near the
end of the round Nelson sent Britt back
with a right to the head.
END IS NEAR.
Britt did the major portion of the
scoring in the twentieth round; â al
though Nelson sent a right and left to
the body that increased the uproar
among th'e spectators. Britt landed a
hard left to the Jaw and then' a right.
He had just landed a right and left to
the head when the gong sounded the
end of the fight. ,, There was no demon
stration when Referee Roche led Britt
to one side and pointed to Jimmy as
the winner.
As the immense gathering Was dis
persing there was much quiet, discus
sion, but the only claims the Nelson
men made were for "the aggressiveness
of their favorite and not for any skill
which he had shown. While he was
boring in and leaning on Britt he was
scoring few clean blows, while Britt
waste'd but few punches throughout.
PRINCIPALS ARRIVE.
At 9:25 p. m. a cheer from the spec
tators in the eastern gallery notified
the .; immense throng that the fighters
were en route to the ring. Britt led
tho>,way and received a great cheer.
He was followed by "Spider" Kelly.
Tiv Kreling, Curtis Richardson --'â  and
Frank Rafael, who were T his seconds:
Immediately behind the- aggregation

Herrman Fights
Hayward From
the Start.
White Boxer Has
Big Lead When
Mill Ends.
The second preliminary mill went to
Gus Herrman over Jim Haywara, the
colored man who trained with Joe
Walcott. The go belonged to either
man for six rounds. In the seventh
Herrman began to rush the colored
man and sent in rights and lefts to the
body in rapid succession. The bout
was a fast one during the eight rounds.
The white boy was the aggressor in
every round, but Hayward's clever
ness held the former at bay.
In the third round Hayward landed
two hard j rights on the jaw. This
seemed to arouse the white boy's fight-
Ing blood and he went right at, Hay
ward. The next three rounds were
even up and Herrman's fast work in
the seventh won him the decision. \
George Delile, a husky soldier, got
a merited verdict over Jim Moran in
the first mixup on the bill of fare. The
bout was four rounds long and con
tained but little fast work. Both men
tired after a few punches had been
struck, but little damage happened to
either man. Moran ran into a straight
left In the second round that raised an
awful bump over the eye.
Delile did most of the work after
the opening round, but his opponent
made a bid for honors in the last
period. The spurt came too late, al
though he had the soldier looking sad.
Fred Sharpe, the noted St. Louis
referee, officiated at both preliminaries.
BETTING UNUSUALLY HEAVY.
When the betting opened some days
since Britt was an 8 to 10 choice. On
Monday the prevailing price was 7 "to
10. ' When betting was resumed yes
terday morning the price was 7% to 10.
Late in the afternoon some heavy
commissions on the Dane, , one of
(1500, which he placed himself, sent
the ; betting to even money. This
looked good to the adherents of Britt
and they went at it with avidity. The
flow of money on the Californian was
so steady that the price went down
point by point until it touched 10 to 6.
A big lot of money was bet on Nelson
before the man entered the ring,
making the closing price 10 to 9.
Each man had a large following,
with the result that an unusually
heavy amount of money was wagered.
It was the heaviest betting affair in
years.
MEN ARE AT WEIGHT.
The announcement that the men
would weigh in at Harry Corbett's at
6 o'clock attracted an immense gather
ing to. the Ellis-street resort.
When the appointed time arrived
the crush was so great that it was
not found expedient to weigh the men
in there and they were whisked away
in carriages to the hamman baths.
No time was lost in preliminary talk
and the men were soon on the scales.
Britfs trainers had gauged his
weighty to such a nicety that when
he stepped on the machine the bar
balanced at the 132-pound notch.
Nelson, who is naturally lighter
tl*un Britt, did not raise the beam. He
weighed about 131*4 pounds.

the fray. They posed for at least half
a dozen pictures. Referee Billy Roche
entered the ring loking like a groom.
He wore a high silk hat, Tuxedo ana
white silk vest and had his delicate
"mitts" 'encased with white kid
gloves. He was introduced as "the
famous Bowery boy" and smiled in
response â â to the good-natured chaf
fing he received from envious persons
close to the ring.
Billy Jordan was there with his. voice
and he soon had the rafters { echoing
with his announcements. He present
ed-Nelson in this manner: "The Chi
cago crackajack, the hardest nut in the
profession to crack, 'Battling' Nelson."
When the cheering subsided he pre
sented J. Edward Britt as "the cham
pion of champions, Jimmy Britt." >.
Challenges from Jabez White of Eng
land, Jimmy Gardner of Lowell and
leeser lights were read and then in re
sponse to cries, "Young Corbett" , ! en
tered the ring. The little fellow - was
given an ovation, which attested his
popularity. Young Corbett challenged
the winner, and then shook hands with
each man. He also shook hands with
Eddie Graney on his way to the ring,
as he wanted -to bury old scores. Cor
bett'was called upon for a speech and
did, wonderfully well.
As there were a few of the fair sex
near the ring side, Young Corbett ad
dressed the crowd as "Ladies and Gen
tlemen," causing a hearty laugh. This
did not stop the little Denver lad and
he continued: "I am glad I have friends
lef t.-v I . suppose you have to â  lose to
find that k you have s friends." I will, if
I get a chance, try to js'ln back. my
title." ' â  :> .
There was more cheering. The fight

BLACKSMITH
KOLB USES GUN
Takes Four Shots at Men He
Claims Attacked Him at
Brannan and Hitch Streets
Four pistol shots coming in rapid
succession shortly after midnight this
morning aroused the people in the vi
cinity of Brannan u.nd Riteh streets.
The shots were fired by August Kolb,
a blacksmith residing at the Winches
ter Hotel. Kolb save three men tried
to hold him up, while Charles and Clar
ence Morsy. 443 Third street, swear
Kolb fired at .them when he met them
c-n the street, saying: "Now I've got
you."
Kolb says he had come from the
fight with hi? stepson. Albert Hart
man, and was on the way to the boy's
home . at Brannan' atid Ritch streets
when' three men jumped out of the
darkness and attempted to hold him
up. He says one of tnem hit him on
the jaw and sent him reeling, to the
other side of the street- When he
arose, Kolb adds, he fired three times
at the men. Policeman Moran then
came on the scene, but the men dis
appeared in the darkness.
Kolb had 540 and a gold watch and
chain on his person. He says his step
son chanced to mention the names of
the Morss brothers when he saw three
men standing near the corner of Ritch
and Brannan streets a moment before
the trouble occurred.
The Morss brothers claim there Is a
long standing grudge between Koib
and themselves and that the former,
fired point blank at ther3 when he met
them on the street, saying: "Now I've
pot you. Charley." < The Morss broth
ers hastened to the Southern Police
station shortly after the trouble and
told their story to the police. Kolb
went to his room in the Winchester in
company with Officer Moran. Detec
tives have been detailed on the case.

FINISH IS SENSATIONAL
Pacifieo. EdinUorough and
Sceptre Capture the First,
Second and Third Events
Â«
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 20.â The finish
of Diamante, the winner of the " last
race, was the stirring feature of the rac
ing at Ascot to-day. From a position
behind a field of seven into the stretch,
Diamante made the greatest finish ever
seen on the local track, and won the
race from Heather Honey, the favorite,
which had a lead of two lengths over
the field at the head of the stretch.
Diamante, was 4 to 1 in the betting and
was well played at this figure.
It was a good day, for favorites, four
of them winning, while a second choice
and a decided outsider took the other
two races.
The first race had fourteen starters,
with Baldwin's entry of Salario. Reta
dor and Pacifieo a 1 to 2 favorit^. The
result was never In doubt, Pacifieo win
ning easily from Revel and Crown
Princess. Edinborough lasted long
enough to beat his field in the second.
Nanon was second and El Verraco
third. The winner was heavily played
all over the ring. Sceptre, which start
ed in his first Jumping race, furnished
the biggest surprise of the day, leading
all the way and winning easily. He
was anywhere from 12 to 15 to 1 in
the betting. Flea was second and Dr.
Long third. Mrs. Grannan, the favor
ite, ran disappointingly. Mad Mullah
sustained his reputation of never being
"outside the money" by winning the
fourth after a very pretty race, Inter
lude second and Cerro Santa third.
Capitanazo scored his third straight
victory by taking the fifth from Tramo

LYNCHERS GET
FULL PENALTY
Stiff Sentences Dealt Out
by a Judge in the Cir
cuit Court of Mississippi
BROOK HAVEN, Miss., Dec. 20. â
In the Circuit Court to-day Dave Po
sey was convicted of manslaughter
for the killing of Ben Bayliss, a ne
gro. The defendant claimed that the
killing was justifiable, as he found the
negro stealing corn. Judge Wilkin
son sentenced Posey to twenty-five
years in the penitentiary.
Judge Wilkinson passed sentence on
ten other men to-day as follows: Oscar
Franklin, lift imprisonment for the
murder of EH Hilson, a negro; Will
Franklin.sD. W. Smith, Elias Smith, R.
D. Smith and Elbert Gill, each 50 years
in the penitentiary for manslaughter
for the killing of Henry List, a negro.
These two killings were the whitecap
cases, which 1 aroused the indignation of
the citizens . and caused the formation
of the. Law and Order League.
John Smith and John McNulty, ne
groes, who were convicted of murder,
received life sentences. J. p. Troy, a
negro, was given a year for burglary.
Sam Posey, who pleaded guilty to two
charges of whitecapping and was con
victed of highway robbery, was sen
tenced to ten years on the robbery
charge and five years on each of the
whitecapping charges, a total of twenty
years. H. Lofton, one of the crowd
concerned in the List killing and who
turned State's evidence, was given his
liberty. â  if^'l

That Aniericaivxolonel who died the
other day after writing a. thousand
novels with 40,000,000 words in them,
has a ' celebrity now which he never
dreamed of in . his lifetime. The
French papers are fulj of him. His
name resounds throughout Italy. The
Danes have paused in the making of
butter for exDdrt to England and have
asked themselves this question:
"Would it not be more profitable to
churn fiction?" It is reckoned that in
this industry the colonel's capacity
per minute every hour of the day
for twenty-four hours was 2.24 words.
It brought him in about Â£2000 a
year and it made his manners "kind,
deferential and yet proud." His
photograph has a\ strongly military
aspect, as of a man whose words were
legion. To the Continental mind he
is* evidently the crowning marvel of
American energj' and : . resource, and
Europe 1 thinks, of his "output" as it
thinks of Niagara '.and the Mississippi.

Fight by Rounds
Continued From Page 10. Column 1.
breaking the men. Britt sent straight left to
the lace, but received in return a right on the
Jaw and a left to the body. Nelson fought
hard and it was give an 1 take. Nelson, If any
thing havjng the advantage. Nelson uppercut
with right to the Jaw, but Britt Bent In right
and left swings to the jaw in return. They
mixed It fiercely, and Brttt slipped to the floor
from a missed rlcht uppercut. The gong rang
with the men In a furious exchange of right
and left swings to the face and jaw. The pace
was almost superhuman, and Britt looked the
more tired of the two as they sought their
corners. .
Sixteenth Round.
They mUÂ»d it at close quarters, giving blow
for blow. Nelson forced Britt to the ropeÂ»,
but the latter was too clever and covered up
and the Dane's vicious onslaughts went for
naught. Nelson kept forcing Britt about thÂ»
ring and Britt's efforts to land on the Dane
were fruitless. Suddenly Brltt got his range
and showered a perfect avalanche- of right and
left swings on Nelson's Jaw. The Dane was
laying low, however, and as., soon as Britt had
worked himoelf into a weak state Nelson went
at him hammer and tongs, landing his right
and left volleys on Britt's head and Jaw.
Brilt went to his corner looking very weak.
Seventeenth Round.
They went to clo?e quarters an<l were sep
arated by Roche. Nelson bored in and Brilt
tried his lefts for the face, but all the blows
were blocked. Brltt swung left and right to
the face, but was apparently tired and Nelson
went alter him in an effort to wear him down.
Britt then stopped these tactics with a re
sumption of his left Jabs and finally swung
a vicious left to the face. Brltt was forced
against the ropes, but wiggled out of danger
like an eel and sent straight left to the face.
Nelson continued after Britt In an endeavor to
get Britt to mix, but Britt kept dancing away
and varied it with straight left jabs to Nel
son's face, which had little If any effect.
The gong rang with Britt much fresher than
in the previous round and with the honors
a shade in his favor.
Eighteenth Round.
Britt jabbed as usual with left to the face
and danced away iroin the Dane, who en
deavored to get him to close quarters. Finally
N>ison sent a straight left to Brltfs jaw
and in a mix they exchanged lefts to the face
and Britt worked a left uppercut to the jaw
which did not stay the Dane in the least.
Britt was again buffeted about the ring, but
stopped Nelfcon with l*ft hook to the body.
The referee then separated them from a clinch
and Britt ripped his left with terrific foroe
to the body. Nelson chased Britt around, but
his blows were ill-timed and Britt kept pegging
away with his left to the jaw and then sent
right swing to the head. Britt went to his
corner with blood flowing from the reopened
abrasion in his forehead. At the end of the
round the crowd yelled itself hoarse, some
yelling "Brltt" and the others "Nelson."
Nineteenth Round.
Nel?on forced Britt about the rinit, but
Britt's footwork was too much for the Dane.
Britt then hooked his left twice to the body
and they went to a clinch. Britt swung: lett
hard to the *ar and /then swung a fearful
lell to jhe body. They mixed it again with
thÂ«? crowd hiaeing. Nelson chased Britt about
again, but Britt met him en all occasions
with straight lefts to the face, which he
varied with a hard right swing to the ear
and a left hook to the body. Britt put another
left hook to the body and they clinched against
the ropee. Nelson suddenly caaght Britt nap
ping and swung two fearful rights and a left
to the jaw, rocking Britt's head. Britt cams
back with ri(tht and left swing bard to the
Jaw and the bell rang with honors even. The
crowd renewed its cries of "Britt." "Nelson."
at the end of the round.
Twentieth Round.
Nelson waded In desperately, but could not
locate the shifty local lad. who suddenly
hooked two fearful lefts to the Jaw and fol
lowed it with another, staggering Nelson a
bit. They fought in ,th?. center: of, . the, ring
and exchanged, rifrtu and' left , swings to the
face. In a clinch Tftefiree Roche had* his "hands
full separating the belligerents. \ Britt then
sent Nelson's head back with a left hook and
followed It with a left swine to the Jaw.
Then ' Britr once" more hooTced his -left to the
jaw and followed it with two right swines
and a left hook to the face. The fighting:
was fearful. Britt going in with left and right
swings to Nelson's jaw and the gong clanged
Oenctir.s that the battle was over. Referee
Roche promptly awarded the decision to Brut.
The decision. was greeted with mingled cheer3
and hls.Â«lnr.

OPINIONS OF EXPERTS.
The Decision of Referee Roche Meets
AVith Popular Favor.
After the battle the views of sport
ing men were secured and in almost
every instance the decision rendered
by Referee Roche was approved.
Alec Greggains said: "It was a
good fight and a good decision. I
think Corbett In condition can defeat
either man."
Phil Wand: "It was a, grand con
test and the referee could not decide
any other way. Britt outpointed Nel
son all the way."
John J. Gleasori: "If Britt had a
knockout punch he would have won in
short order. Jimmy put up a great
fight and deserved a decision."
George Harling: "It was a slash
ing battle. Britt outpointed Nelson,
but the Dane certainly is . a wonder
ful fighter. The decision suited me."
Young Corbett: "Say for me that
it was a poor battle. I wish I had
been in there to-night and in condi
tion. I would have beaten either
man. I will go to Harbin Springs in
a few* days and train in the hope of
getting a return match with either
Nelson or Britt. The decision was all
right."
â¢Billy Jordan: "Roche decided all
right. Britt is a great boy."
Bob Smith: "The worst Nelson
should' have got was a- draw. The
climate out here seems to make na
tive sons out of all our referees."
William Greer Harrison: "Britt
put up/ a wonderful battle against a
dangerous opponent. He displayed
courage and cleverness and was right
fully declared the victor."*
Eddie Graney: "Had I ref&rsed the
contest I would have decided in
Britt's favor. Nelson was aggressive,
but Brltt landed the most blows."
Refused Gold Coins.
A man, on a wager of $1000, recently
stood at Wall street and Broadway.
New York City, for a whole day several
years ago offering $5 gold pieces for 50
cents, and was unable to' find a pur
chaser. Every passer-by said to him
self, "Can't fool me!" . The coins were
genuine, but there was just a touch of
human nature, which convinced all
that the dealer was selling gilded lead
and making 500 per cent profit.

Cigar From ,King Edward.
One of King Edward's little human
weaknesses is said to be a fondness for
witnessing a flre.
A writer in the People's Friend tells
of bim that, when he was Prince of
Wales, one evening, on hearing the j
rush of fire engines passing, he fol
lowed them to see their operations. j
While looking on, he entered into
conversation with a reporter, who was |
taking note3 of Uhe occurrence, and
when about to return home again he
drew out his cigar case and afforded
the reporter a" cigar, which he willing
ly accepted, and, tearing out a leaf
from his notebook, proceeded care
fully to' roll it up.
On the Prince asking the reason for ;
his doing so, he replied: "I may i
never again have the honor of receiv
ing a cigar. from your Highness, and
should like to keep this one as a sou
venir."
The Prince observed: "You know |
me, then. I did not think I should be j
recognized," and, again producing his
cigar case, said: "Will you have a
cigar?"
The reporter, nothing loath, accept
ed again the kind invitation, the
Prince remarking as he did so, "But
to smoke this time."â Liverpool Post.
"We . want shorter hours," demanded |
the workmen's leader. ','AU right;" as-,
serted the accommodating employer,
'â¢I'll reduce â¢ your dinner hour fifteen
â¢minutes."
SLAIN GIRL'S
CLOTHES FOUND
Clew in Mysterious ilurdei
Case in Colorado Supplied
by a Woman Mine Owner
XEW FACTS DEVELOPED
She Says She Saw a Man in
Last Part of November Act
in Queer Way in Vicinity
PUEBLO, Colo., Dec. 20.â Evidence
gathered by the police Indicates that
the murdered woman found in Chey
enne Canyon several days ago may
have been Sadie Durant, a woman who
came. to Pueblo late In October from
California. She left Pueblo on Decem
ber 3 with the expressed purpose of
going to Victor for a short visit, an-1
she has not been heard from since that
time. Her description closely resem
bles that of the dead woman. But lit
tle is known of her in Pueblo. It i3
said that she was separated from her
husband and feared violence in case
he should find her.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Dec
20. â The latest clew in the murder mys
tery of Cheyenne Mountain, which has
been received by the Sheriff and Chief
of Police, is now being traced up by
the officers with some show of success.
The clew was supplied by Mrs. Ellen
E. Jack, who owns a number of min
ing claims on Cheyenne Mountain and
who discovered several pieces of wom
an's clothing while on her way to the
city yesterday.
A part of a white skirt and portions
of a woolen dress were discovered, but
as she had heard nothing of the sen
sational murder Mrs. Jack did not re
port her find until to-day. Sheriff
Grimes and Chief of Police Reynolds
and two officers went at once to the Â»e
glon described by Mrs. Jack.
The woman says that about dusk In
the latter part of November she saw
a man, whom she took to be a German,
climbing along the hillside in an excit
ed manner and carrying a bundle in a
gunny-sack. He appeared to be avoid
ing the regular roadway as much as
possible, and walked among the trees
along the road. The man was greatly
excited and asked to be directed to
some place to sto^ for the night. "When
directed to the section-house on the
Short Line road he paid no attention.
but continued on over the hill toward
Cripple Creek.
John Quirk of Denver, who thought
from the description that the body
might be that of his wife, after viewing
the remains, said that his fears were
groundless.
HAIR OB^ OCTOGEXARLVX
TAKES YOUTHFUL COLOR
At Advanced Age Massachusetts Lady
Cuts Her Second Set of Teeth
and Recovers Vision.
"Toothless and cappy," the young
woman's description of her venerable
gnrandmother, would be singularly in
applicable to Miss Rose Perkins of
Huntingdon, Mass. At the advanced
age of 85 Miss Perkins finds that her
hair, which has been snow white for
many years, is beginning to turn black.
She is also beginning to cut a set of
new teeth. This process of renais
sance began about seven years ago.
when her eyesight, . which had failed
her several years before, was suddenly
restored to her and she threw her
glasses away. Since then she has had
no use for them.
So excellent i3 her eyesight. Indeed,
that she has just completed a large
bedquilt composed of nine stars, each
star containing the enormous number
of 278 diamonds.
If Miss Perkins does not find old age
the toothless, miserable existence It is
reputed to be. neither does she find it
a period of superfluity. She Is "smart,"
as they ?ay in New England, about the
house, aids materially In the house
work and delights in reading and sew
ing. She attends church with a regu
larity that is enough to shame the
younger generation. Avalks about town
on little shopping expeditions, visits
her neighbors, and is as cheerful and
Hghthearted as a girl of sixteen. In
deed, she says she feels as if her girl
hood were returning to her, but sup
poses it is only that second childhood
people talk so much about.
â  Her mind is perfectly clear and her
memory is good. She not only recol
lects events o* her girlhood days, but
keeps well in mind the more recent
events. Instead of living in the past
she takes an intense Interest in the
present, and she is an entertaining
talker. She says she cannot account
for her white hair turning back to
black or .for th? third set of teeth
which she is cutting, but fancies that
her strong determination not to become
an uninteresting old person may have
something to do with it.â New York
Tribune.

to stiffen as the end of the year approaches

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO Dec. 20. â The greatest weakness
In the wheat market was manifested at the
Immediate opening. Under the Influence of a
f harp break in prices at Liverpool, Initial quo
tations here showed substantial losses, the May
option being off *4c to *4e at $1 10*4 to $110*;.
According to a prominent British crop statisti
cian, the decline at Liverpool was caused ty
holders reselling Argentine cargoes and by
late offerings of parcels from that country ax
lower figures. ! Another factcr that contributed
to weakness here was the comparatively heavy
movement In the Northwest, arrivals at Minne
apolis and Duluth to-day being 76S cars,
against 424 the corresponding day a year ago.'
At the start shorts took advantage of the
lower prices and covered freely. Congested
conditions of the December delivery caused a
quick advance In the price of that option,
other months rising In sympathy. The revival
cf bullish sentiment was aided by small re
ceipts in the Southwest. On the upturn May
sold up to $111. Realizing sales caused an
other reaction late in the day and the market
closed easy. Final quotations on May were at
$1 10%. a less of He
Corn was weak throughout. Buying by
shorts had a steadying effect. May closed *;c
down at 45*4c.
In oats the volume of trading was light.
May closed uncharged at 31*4c
Provisions were a trlSe easier in the session
as a result cf a small decline In prices at the
yards. Sentiment later became firmer on a fair
demand from packers. At the close May pork
and lard were each up 2*4c and ribs were un
changed.

VARIOUS PHASES OF LITIGATION IN THE LOCAL COURTS
MOTION TO NONSUIT
OVERRULED BY COURT
Attorney Collins in Monnier Will Con
le*t Tries to Have Case Closed,
Alleging Insufficient Evidence.
The counsel for both sides in the
Monnier will contest that Is being
tried in Judre Graham's court spent
yesterday arguing over the motion
made by Attorney George D. Collie
for the proponent to nonsuit on the
ground that the contestant failed to
prove his case. After strenuous argu
ment, alternating among Collins, Sul
livan and Roche, the court overruled
the motion to nonsuit, and again sub
mitted the case to the Jury.
Two other Issues brought up by Col
lins were also fought over, and the
court will announce its decision this
morning. They are the claims made
by Collins that the testimony as to the
legitimacy of George Monnier Jr.
should be stricken out, as the adop
tion record, which was admitted as
evidence, establishes the son's right
to contest. The other motion by Col
lins was to strike out all testimony
relating to the supposed remarks of
the elder Monnier as to what provision
he Intended making for his son.
These motions were strongly op
posed by Sullivan and Roche, who ar
gued that In case the proceedings
â¢went to the Supreme Court with the
testimony of illegitimacy out It might
necessitate a new trial, should the
Supreme Court decide that the adop
tion record was Invalid.
The contestant's attorneys opposed
the second motion on the gi-ound that
It was only by the remarks made by
Monnier Sr. to witnesses that the
father's disposition toward his son
could be accurately determined. The
case goes on this morning at 10
o'clock.

ELiECTlOX BOARD RENEWS
FIGHT FOR ITS RIGHTS
Notice of Motion Filed to Stop Any
Proceedings on the Amended
Accusation.
When the matter of the amended
accusation against the Election Com
missioners, charging them with mal
feasance in office," was called in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday morning: At
torney T. V. Cator, on behalf of the
Commissioners, filed a preliminary
motion to set aside the process, which
will be argued this morning.
The motion sets forth that the Com
missioners are not under or within
the Jurisdiction of the court, and, re
serving their right to demur against
the illegality of the accusation, they
object to any proceedings by the court
against them because no legal or law
ful process has been served. For that
and other reasons .they move that the
court set aside the process and service
thereof.
The motion was accompanied by an
affidavit of James A. Devoto, one of
the accused Commissioners, who al
leges that none of the accused or their
attorneys were present in court when
the order was made on December 7
placing the case on the calendar for
December 20. He also alleges that
the indorsement of the title of the
cause was omitted in the indorsement
made upon the papers served by the
Sheriff and that the return was not
annexed to the original accusation.
Another allegation is that when the
paper dated December 7 was issued
there was not existing nor pending in
any court any accusation in the name
of the people against the Commission
ers. He averred therefore â¢ that the
issuance of the paper was in excess
of "the jurisdiction of the court and
was null and void.

WIDOW OF DR. GONZALES
! WANTS VALUABLE LAND
Her Effort in Court to Get Beat Part
>oÂ£ Ranch Is Opposed by the
Other Heirs.
. An effort to have! $75,000 worth of
land set apart as homestead is being
made in Judge Kerrigan's court by
Kdie W. Gonzales, widow of the late
Dr. Mariano K. Gonzales, and the plan
is being opposed by Anita. Gonzales,
daughter of the deceased. The pro
ceedings may partly be considered as
a skirmish for a probable contest of
Gonzales' will by the widow and
daughter. The year in which 'such a
movement may be made has nearly
elapsed and Mrs. Gonzales Is anxious
to : determine her- homestead rights.
Her application is â¢ for the cream of
a 6600-acre. ranch near the town of-
Gonzales, in Monterey County. The
ranch is now divided into several
farms, occupied by lessees. The en
tire, property is valued at $175,000.
Mayor Robert Johnson of Monterey,
executor of the estate, was on the
stand yesterday to explain the lay of
the land. '
The widow is represented by Charles
S. 'Wheeler, the daughter by Judge
Slack and the administrator by Reuben
II. Lloyd. Several grandnephews and
grandnieces are represented by T. L.
Geary Jr. â¢ They are the residuary
legatees under the will and say that
if the widow's demand is granted their
value in the estate will be injured.
As it now stands Mrs. Gonzales is en
titled to a fourth of the income from
the land. The hearing will be re
sumed to-morrow.
It's a. 'Merry Christmas.

SAMUELi NEWMAN LIES
Â» ILL IX LOCAL HOSPITAL
Former * Prominent Democratic Pol

Operation at Waldeck.
Samuel Newman, one of the best
known politicians in San Francisco,
lies In a precarious condition at the
Waldeck Hospital as a result of an
operation which " he underwent two
days ago. For a time yesterday it was
feared that he would not live through
the day, but last evening the patient
fell Into a peaceful sleep, and at mid
night' it was reported that he was
showing signs of improvement, al
though still very low.
Newman was for many years prom
inently identified with the Democratic
party in this city, and was also known
as a confidential friend of Chris Buck
ley, the political boss. He served in
several political positions, the latest
being the secretaryship of the State

Supervisor d'Ancona.of the Finance
Committee stated yesterday that the
city will shortly be in possession of a
cemetery for the burial of the indigent
dead. The committee is at present
negotiating for the purchase of a
twenty-five-acre tract In San Mateo
County, which is deemed in every way
desirable for the purpose. The owner
of the tract has offered to sell it to
the city for $200 an acre. As an ap
propriation of $5000 has been
made to buy a cemetery site
the city is in a ' position to ac
quire it at once. . There are some
details to be attended to In the matter,
but it Is. expected that before two
months have passed the city will be
burying its indigents instead of having
it done by contract, which has proven
objectionable -in more ways than one
for. many years. .
