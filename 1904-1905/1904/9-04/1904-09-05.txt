â¢ SORROW IS SOFTENED., ';
The people turned from . their mourning to
punish the assassin. Let that assassin be name
less ' forevermore. ' The national sorrow haa
.been softened and has yielded to the healing
touch of ttme. âInspired â¢ by love and admira
tion and gratitude, we. his f raters: you. .his
countrymen, gathered Â¦< together from. all parU
of our united Country, devote this hour to. the
immortal memory of .Sir Knight ", William Mc-
Kinleyl : " . '
Three summers have ' shed their blossoms on

der the direction of Professor McKen
zle: a paraphrase of "Nearer. My God,
to Thee," a transcription of Schubert's
serenade and the "Sanctus" from
"Mass Sollenelle," were rendered by the
band.
Sir Knight Shortridge's oration was
as follows:
How myeterious are the decreei of Provi
dence! How hard It is to suffer and not de
spair â how â¢ pitiless and cruel seem the .blows'
that, smite upon our hearts and strike down
, the objects of our love, we know too. well,
pverrvhelmed &nd crushed by a great and un
expected sorrow, we * "trouble deaf heaven with
our 'bootless cries": we proFe and stagger In
darkness â the sun is dimmed, the stars go out;
we question and, God forgive us. doubt his . wis
dom and Justice. But once more ' the morntn?
breaks and' the darkners He-en away; sorrow Is
transmuted Into a sweet and tender memory:
our very Â¦ pain Is swallowed up In Â¦ pride cf
thorn we mourn: garlands of joy take the place
of the habiliments of woe; the, funeral sym
pathizer-becomes the marriage: guest,' and.
with heart purified by trial, with faith rÂ«
.newed and 'doubts departed, we come to re
alize that "it lÂ« God f s way. His will, not
burn, be done." ...
And if this bÂ« true of each of us who ' has
loved and loet, howovertrue it Is of a nation
that is robbed of its champion and benefactor,

ET. PETERSBURG. Sept. 4. 7:40 p. m.
General Stakelberg's First Siberian
Army Corps, which was reported yes
terday by General Kuropatkin as hav
ing been cut off to thÂ» westward of
Liaoyanc, h.is b?*Â»n safely extricated.
General K';ropatkln telpgraphed at 7
.o'clock Saturday evening that the
greater portion of his army was then
touth of Yantai. about ten miles north
cast <.<? Liaoyang. and that the other
portion of it was crossing the Taitse
River and taking uj> a position on the I
right bank. This message, which was
leceived l>y the Emperor early on Sun
day morning, threw a mrÂ»re hopeful
lit ht on the position of the Russian
army, and the authorities gave sighs of
lelief.
There is no attempt, however, to con
ceal the gravity of the situation in view
of the absence of news regarding what
has occurred to-day.' It is not clear
from th* latest telegrams whether the
Russians are continuing their retreat
or have b*Â»en compelled to facÂ«? their
foe.
Th* gloomy report telegraphed by
the Russian commander In chief in
thÂ«Â» early stages of the fight of Satur
day last and his bitter reproaches
against General Stakelberg are attrib
uted to his chagrin over the failure of
his offensive plans."
General Kuropatkin now telegraphs
Â«
that his only serious losses were con
fined to Major General Orloff's detach
ment, which was guarding the left
flank at Yentai. This detachment con
sisted of mixed European detachments
and was suddenly attacked by Japan
ese infantry and artillery concealed in
the tall Chinese corn and grass. The
Russians seem to have lost their heads
and to have retreated precipitately.
The Japanese inflicted great slaughter,
Â»r.* of General OrlofTs regiments losing
l.VK) men.
No details are given of the escape of
General .Stakelberg's corps from the
clutches of the enemy, but it is believed
that it owes its safety to the neglect
or the inability of the Japanese to fol
low up their advantage. General Stak
elberg was allowed to cross the river
and come up with the main army in
tin-.e to enable the shattered remnants
of Major General Orloff's detachment
to retreat. This exploit is likely to
condone General Stakelberg's disobedi
ence, but unless the Emperor forgives
him he will have to appear before a
court-martial and probably will lose
his command.
The War Office is able to make the
reassuring statement that the Russian
retreat from Liaoyang did not involve
the loss or gups and it is also declared
that the abandoned stores at Liaoyang

What effect the present: result will
have upon Kuropatkin's reputation, at
home it is impossible to say. - It may
be remembered, however, . that before
starting tor the Far. East; General
Kuropatkin said that he fully expected
his reputation to- sink lower than his
friends even dreamed, but that there
after there -aould come a turn and it
would rebound. . He was unwilling to
predict where the, turn would occur.
The battleship Orel ; . % has. gone f to
Kronstadt. This brings* Rear 'Admiral
Rojestvensky's squadron up to its full
complement. . . , , " '
One feature of the situation, however,
has apparently been overlooked by the
local critics in their recent eagerness
to chronicle a decisive engagement,
namely, that Kuropatkin is still- in
command of the railway and apparent
ly has saved a majority of the rolling
Ftock. This is chiefly^ in requisition at
present for the transportation of the
wounded, but Mukden, with strong de
fenses, is less than thirty miles north
of Yentai. What force, Kuropatkin -is
holding in reserve there even the au
thorities do not exactly know, but It is
believed that it must.be considerable,
while th'e European reinforcements,
which have been rushed east for weeks
past, are pouring in there, daily. ,
The Japanese army is confessedly
r-xhausted and is getting farther from
its base of supplies. If it reach Muk
den without dealing. Kurppatkin a
crushing blowâ and Field Marshal
Oyama seems to be not yet able to
envelop the Russian forceâ the Japan
ese will find themselves in front of. a
fresh and strongly defended city,
where' the Russians will be 'sure of a
v/arm 1 welcome and, renewed supplies
and against which it' seems impossible
that the Japanese commander, will be
able to hurl his brave, but worn out
and possibly starving, forces. ,;.
It is possible that even now Rusgian
reinforcements may be descending from
the north to. aid their retreating com
rades at Mukden, which, is less than
two days' ordinary march distant, even
ignoring the, railway. . ,. .; y
The country is ill suited to military
operations. It is flatter and more open
than the region south of Liaoyang, but
is covered _at this season with dense
fields of Chinese corn, growing higher,
than a man on horseback. It is more
suited to surprise tactics and to of
fensive operations than to an orderly
retreat.

in 'dealing with other important dip
lomatic affairs, such as the granting
of . concessions to or the making of
contracts with foreigners."
The Japanese Government 'explained
the foregoing agreement as follows:
"This agreement is nothing more
than a natural and logical sequence to
the; protocol of February 23. It will be
remembered that in this- protocol the
Japanese Government undertook to
give advice to the Korean Government
with regard to improvements of ad
ministration, which advice the latter
a,greed to accept .with full confidence.
The financial embarrassment of the
Korean 1 Government has been, in the
past, a constant cause of internal
trouble and the. chief hindrance to the
development of foreign commerce. This
serious aspect * of ' Korean administra
tion naturally , attracted the first at
tention 'Â¦Â¦ of the Japanese
7 "It Cwill -be remembered .further that
in Â»the -protocol -itVw.aa stipulated that
in" ''case c'thV-Vweif are - of "~ the imperial
house of Korea, ' prÂ»the;,terrHorial , Jn
ti'grity 'OfuKorear was- endangered^ by
the : agre^siJpn; of ra^ third vpower or, by,
in.tern&IiidisturbaneJe,.;. the Japanese
Government, was to; take/the measures
made requisite 'b*y the circumstances.
This stipulation makes it incumbent
upon' Japan to exercise careful-con
trol respecting Korean diplomacy. 1 In
fact, the responsibilites devolving upon
the Japanese Government in -conse
quence of this protocol of February
23 can be discharged only by possess
ing a consultive voice in all import
ant questions of foreign intercourse
and in assisting Korea to secure trust
worthy advisers to examine on the
spot questions of international con
cern. These measures ''to j control
Korean finances and Korean foreign
intercourse do not )n any way inter
fere with the full operation and va
lidity of Korea's treaties.
''Article No. 3 is not intended to
place;' an' impediment- upÂ£ri the legiti
mate enterprise of foreigners in the
sphere' of commerce and industry, but
is caluculated to serve as a precaution
against the^conclusion of improvident
and dangerous engagements, which' in

of serious complications, such as was
shown conspicuously in the case of the

The Standard characterizes Kuropat

"wide and flooded Taitse River, in the

belief that the Russian commander,
having temporarily extricated himself,

an "army in being."

"All we know," says the Daily

WITH FOKGERY
On September 1, owing to the extreme
fatigue of Generals Oku's and Nodzu's
forces, all was quiet until 2 o'clock in
the afternoon, when forty-two guns
opened simultaneously on Liaoyang and
continued until dark. Little damage
was done, only four persons being
killed. The Russian artillery began to
reply at 3 p. m. and under cover of a
.sharp cannonade the evacuation of the
town was commenced and a' new rail
road station was established several
versts to the north, the station master,
his assistants and the engineers all
working bravely under fire and ap
parently having contempt for the flying
shells. General Kuropatkin decorated
the station master for his services.
The fight of August 3M continued in
a terrific manner until after dark. The
Japanese maintained a sxorm of artil
lery fire on the- Russian positions and
pressed the Russian right flank and
southern front, but they were driven
back by the infantry whenever they
came within rifle range.
The Russians are in the best of
spirits. The wounded speak in the
highest terms of . the bravery and en
durance of the Japanese-
The battle near Liaoyang continues
to-day (Saturday)". There has been
hot cross-firing at the Yentai, mines,
but at present silence prevails and no
firing is heard in any direction.
HEAVY. ARTILIiKRY FIRE.
YEXTAI. Saturday, Sept. 3.â The
battle continued with great fierceness
up to Friday. The Russians evacuated
Liaoyang, but got the bulk of" their
rolling stock across the river safely.
A new station, with locomotives, trains,
etc., was... established several versts
north of the Taitse River, as was a
general station for the Red Cross.
On- Friday, the fc-urth day of the
battle of Liaoyang and the tenth of
the 'general advance, the battle .com
menced at dawn on both sides of the
Taitse River. The Japanese .advanced
early in the morning in the direction of
the Yentai mines, which were' defended
by twelve battalions* 'Â¦>.' * ' !
Owing to the superiority of the Jap
anese-this force was giving way, pre
paratory to 'retiring" on its rear;. posi
tion, when fresh men were brought up,
which enabled it to retain its former
position.
From the left bank of the Taitse the
Japanese persistently bombarded Liao
yang,..their ..shells reaching as far as
the railway station. ".
The Russian- troops on September 1
occupied the main line, where the Jap
anese assaults - were persistent and
deadly;- and ' the Russians tivt only
stood off â¢: the attacks, but tookthe of

occupied a. village in front of the posi

The> advance through the Chinese

thVstalks had been cut down in places.
The Russians pushed forward in the
face Qfe^all' obstacles and. reaching the
Japanese lines, drove in an assault be
fore which the Japanese fled, leaving
piles of corpses. The Russian losses
also were very heavy.
On the evening of September 2 a large
Japanese force occupied the right bank
of the Taitse' River. is reported to
have consisted of the "whole of General
Kuroki's and Nodzu's armies, General
Oku alone' remaining south of Liao

CZAR PROMOTES GENERALS.
The severity of the 'Russian defeat
hinges largely oo Kuroki's movement.
If successful, the number of Russian
prisoners will be large. The meager re
ports received indicate that the sol
diers of both armies went to the limit
of human endurance and suffered ter
ribly. It was impossible constantly to
supply them v/jth food and water and
the men have fought for, days past
starving and parched with thirst.
Although fail details are lacking, the
duration of the fighting, the numbers
engaged and the losses so far reported
indicate that the battle of Liaoyang
will pre\e to . have been one of the
greatest of history. . .
The dispatch received from Field
Marshal Oyama announcing the fall of
Liaoyang had the* effect of cheering up
all the subjects of the Mikado.
Throughout the rejoicings here, follow
ing the earlier successes of the Japan
ese arms at Liaoyang, the more
thoughtful Japanese, feared the results
of the exposure to which the right wing
of General Kuroki's army was sub
jected and It was held possible that
the strength of the Liaoyang fortifica
tions would permit the withdrawal of
the bulk of the Russian forces . there.
Even now there is doubt concerning
the number of Russians who hav^ es
caped, but there is no doubt about the
character of the victory at Liaoyang.'
Tokio was brilliantly illuminated to
night and Joyful crowds paraded the
streets, cheering the exploits of Field
Marsha] Oyama and Generals' Oku,
Kuroki and Nodzu.

TOKIO. Sept. 4.â Beyond Field Mar
shal Oyama's dispatches reporting the
occupation of Liaoyang'and the com
mencement'of General Kuroki's turn-*
ing movement against the Russian left,
nothing further concerning the battlfe
o-f Liaoyang has reached Tokio to-day.
Neither the number of Russians who
succeeded in- escaping northward nor
the number encompassed by General
Kuroki's turning movement is known
here.

FOUR DAYS' FIERCE FIGHTING.
Â¦ The secord general assault on' Port
Arthur assumed crushing proportions,
on August 27 and continued unabated
until the morning of August 31, when
the Japanese retired- everywhere ex
cept from Palichuang, which' they have
apparently firmly secured. .
. Etzshan, was re-attacked on August
30 with great furv. but the Japanese
were unable to secure a position. A
fierce assault was made on the left
flank at 3 o'clock in the morning. The
assault lasted until 8. a. m., when the
Japanese retired. The bombardment
then recommenced, the Japanese firing
chiefly from Suishiying and Palichu
anp, the Russians from Antszshan.
The Japanese losses, according to th?
Russian estimate,, were 8000 during the
four days from August 2" to August 31.
The Russian losses ar<? placed at 3000.
During the assault shells from the field
guns and. rifle bullets fell in the city.
The Russian ships in the harbor par
ticipated occasionally in the firing.
GARRISON IS DWINDLING.
A reliable authority in touch with
events at Port Arthur declares that a
week ago the garrison numbered ap
proximately 15.000. Accepting the Chi
nese report of the recent lorsos, the effi
cient men now number 12,000. The past
week's advices confirm previous deduc
tions that the Japanese are bending
their fiercest energy to secure an-in
gress along the railroad.
The 'Japanese now expect, it is said,
two months or possibly more of fight
ing before the fortress is taken. The
garrison is said to be greatly worn and
weary, but determined to continue re
sistance, always hoping that General
Kuropatkin will soon gain sufficient
strength to come to its relief.

Several members of Trinity and
Portland commanderies of Manches
ter, New Hampshire, which arrived
in this city last night, narrowly es
caped serious injuries on the famous
seventeen mile drive In Monterey
County yesterday afternoon. While
members of the party were enjoying
a ride the brakes on one of the car
riages failed to work properly on a
steep hill and the nine occupants and
driver were thrown out. All were
more or less injured. Dr. F. E. Brig
ham of Salmon Falls, N. H., received
the worst injuries, being thrown heav
ily on his head and shoulders against
a tree. Three ladles of the Portland
Commandery miraculously escaped
serious injury, being thrown among
the frightened horses. â¢
One of the wheel horses was killed
outright and the other three were
more or less battered in the accident."
Dr. " Brigham and the other injured
persons were all able to come to this
city on their special train.
HAVE NARROW ESCAPE.
A lar-e delegation of Knights Tem
plar from the State of Washington ar
rived here yesterday on the steamship
Spokane. With their wives and fami
lies they numbered 181 and within
half an hour after the steamer tied up
at Broadway dock the crowd that had
thronged the Spokane's decks mingled
with the multitude that like a tide
swept the water front and lost their
identity. The Spokane was exclusively
a Knight Templar ship for this trip.
She carried no second class or steer
age passengers. On account of the large
number of the Knights and in view
of the fact that the regular traffic
is very heavy - just now, the Spokane
made a ' special trip for the benefit of
those attending the Conclave. Fine
weather was encountered all the way
down the coast.

CALIFORNIA AT PAVHIOX.
â¢ Preceded by California Commandery's
Templar Choir and the choir of Trinity
Church singing "Stand Up, Stand Up
for Jesus," the members of California
Commandery marched down the alsla
of Mechanics' Pavilion yesterday to at
tend religious' services. Every seat in
the great building was occupied and
many who sought admission were
turned away. The Knights in full uni
form presented a splendid appearance.
At the conclusion of the hymn the
reading of responses was begun by
Prelate Ferguson in the words "The
earth is the Lord's and all that therein
ie; the compass of the world and they
that dwell therein." The Knights re
sponded with the next paragraph of
the psalm and it was concluded verse
by verse. The Lord's Prayer was then
rendered by the Templar Choir, fol
lowed by another responsive reading
beginning as follows:
Prelate: Wt remember. O Lord, and we dp
laost humbly beseech thee to remember our
country, that cur ruler* may have rrace. wis
dom and understands* to execute justice and

CHOIR SINGS HYMNS.
"Jesus. Lover of My Soul." by the
Templar Choir, was the next number,
followed by the Declaration of Faith,
the Apostles' Creed and Gounod's Sanc
tus. The first lesson (Psalm 1S9). the
Te Deum, the second lesson (L Peter,
11:7-17) an dthe anthem "Praise Ye
the Father." followed. The sermon by
Rev. Dr. Clampett was a splendid ef
fort. Without going back into the his
tory of the order he commented on
their adherence to Christian faith, con
cluding with a splendid tribute to the
memory of the late President McKin
ley. In part he said:
In this capital city of the Western extremity
of a vast continent are leathered together un
Â£*r one roof representatives cf one of the
greatest orders of the world. Out of the mist
and fop of human judrnvnt rises the sun of
rhrnian belief. Those here assembled have

â¢ 'f this crÂ»Â»ed is" the foundation of all that is
best in human belieT. It registers a vow
whi^h once made on earth is sealed in eter
nity and Is the noblest that a man can make.

The officers of the Grand Encamp
ment of Knights Templar of the United
States attended special religious ser
vices yesterday morning at the First
Congregational Church. The members
of the encampment were In full uniform
and made an imposing sight as they
filed into the edifice. On their march to
the church they were escorted by Gold
en Gate Commander;" No. 16, in full
dress uniform, ajid as the officers of
the encampment filed past the com
mandery stood at salute, facing the
church. As the Knights of this splen
did commander/ stood in line, with the
sunlight gleaming on their uplifted
swords, they presented a truly military
spectacle. After the officers of the
Grand Encampment had entered the
church sharp command was given and
the Knights marched into the church,
two abreast, and entered their respec
tive pews. : " /; *
Sir William H. Jordan, prelate of
Golden Gate Commandery, conducted
the beautiful and appropriate special
service, while the Rev. George C. Ad
ams, pastor of the church, officiated
during part of the service.
The sermon was delivered by Sir Dan
iel C. Roberts, D. D., grand prelate of
the Grand Encampment, who dwelt on
the service the idea of knighthood does
for the young men of America. He also
spoke of the value of time and oppor
tunity and their use and abuse. In it
all, he said, was the spirit of the Re
deemer warming the breasts of Knights
of modern times as He did those of the
Knights of old.
At the conclusion of the service the
Knights filed out of the church, formed
and countermarched on Post street to
Market, where they disbanded.

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
OAKLAND, Sept. 4.â The twenty
ninth anniversary; of Admission ' day,
as commemorated by the Native" Sons
of the Golden West, will have a double
celebration, one in St. Louis at the
World's Exposition and the other in
Oakland. It was originally intended
that tlie main celebration should be in
St. Louis, but it was round that the
number of Caiiforniaris who could be
there would be small compared with
these who would remain in their native
State, and it was decided that there 1
should be a. ceiebration in Oakland to
accommodate the latter. Thus Oak- j
land will have its first Admission day
celebration.
The St. Louis celebration will have
the benefit of the presence oÂ£ Grand
President C. E. McLaughlin, who is
now at the exposition. He will wel
come the Native Sons' special train,
which left Oakland yesterday over the
Southern Pacific lines. But the bulk
of the Native Sons of the State will
find themselves in Oakland on Friday
next rather than in St. Louis. Mr. Mc-
Laughlin has sent the following cordial
letter to the Oakland committee:
QUINCY, August 12, 1904.
DÂ»ar Brothers: Your, very courteous invita
tion to' participate In the celebration of-Ad
mission iiay at Oakland lies before me. Duty
compels my presence In St. LoulÂ» on that day,
and it will be impossible for me to be with
you.
It Is more than likely, however, that, amid all
the glamour of the celebration at the great
exposition, my mind will wander hack to Cali
fornia und to my brothers of Alameda and
adjoining counties.
Wishing your committee . every, success,'- I
am fraternally yours, Â¦ Â¦
C E. McLAUGHLIX. Grand. President.

Camozzi, while despondent from suf
fering with an incurable malady, blew
off the side of his head Friday night
with a shotgun at his home, 6jS* Myrtle
street. Neighbors heard the shot and
found the wounded man lying on his
bed. Camozzi had pressed the muzzle
of the weapon against his head and
had pulled the trigger with his stock
inged foot. The charge tore away the
left Bide of his jaw and cheek.
Only a week before that the sufferer
had returned from the County Hospital,
Â¦where he had been under treatment
for some time. Realizing that he must
soon die from the disease the sick man
decided to end his suffering. He was
taken Saturday to the County Infirm
ary, where he died at 10 o'clock this
morning. Camozzi was 4S years old, a
native of Switzerland.
"J^et him stay where he is and let
him be buried where he is" was the
reply Deputy Coroner Henry Quellen
received to-day when he notified J. J.
Camozzi, a hotel-keeper at Napa Junc

ozzi, had died this morning at the
County Infirmary from a' self-inflicted
gunshot wound.

several months past, lri Jact my resignation
v.-as tendered to the president of the associa

<. pt the resignation (or fear that it might
Imperil the new building project.
It may be a matter of news to the people
of Oakland to know that I did not come to
Oakland as general secretary of the associa

by the invitation of the international rare

of *;-<>.u,o on the old building. It was thought
that the work could be completed in four
mouths* time at the longest. After~^thÂ«- de

and < rtanl2> for a campaign for a new build
ing. I was aFhed by tlif b^ard to remain in

but I ctclintd 'to- leave .Oakland - until 1 felt
that ir.attets were safe here.

British naval critics consider the
recent building of twenty torpedo
boat destroyers and the further addi
tion of thirty-four," as provided for
in the naval estimates, a mistake.
There has been too great a sacrifice of
speed in the nev/ boats in order ,- to
obtain reliability and safety, for/while
those built prior to 1903 had nominal
speeds of 30 knots, with horsepowers
ranging from 6600 to 6000. the new
boats of much larger displacements
and 7000 horsepower do not 1 exceed
2G knots. The losses of two destroy
ers under conditions which indicated
that the hulls were too frail to stand
the stress* of sea and weather,-. led to
a modification of speed, and other re
quirements; but the difference between
30 knots and 20 knots is too great a
sacrifice and places 1 the new . British
destroyers at a decided disadvantage
as compared with French and Ger
man boats/ France is building; de
stroyers ranging from 280 to 335 tons,'
having speeds ranging 'from 28 to 30
knots, and Germany still: .''continues'
adding division boats of 350 tons and
29 knots .speed, to. , her, navy. ; No
structural deficiency has been experi-
Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans, re
cently "in command of the Asiatic
squadron, has come to the conclusion
that the excessive use of alcoholic
drinks while on liberty ashore or when
smuggled on board ship is one of the
worst drawbacks to discipline, and that
the majority of court-martial cases are
directly due to this cause. It is useless,
he says, to attempt to control this mat
ter by present regulations, which pre
vent the men from having a reasonable
quantity of beer and light wines on
board ships, and he recommends the
establishing of canteens, Â»"where such
beverages may be sold to the men while
at their meals or when coaling ship. He
urges the Navy Department to try the
proposed system for a period of six
months with a view of ascertaining
what effect it will have on naval disci
pline.
The British armored .cruiser Levia
than, 14,100 tons, attached to the China
station, grounded while anchored in
Yungching Bay during the latter par'
of July and sustained considerabla
damage. The double bottom, however,
saved the ship, and when the tide lifted
her she was able to steam to Hongkong
for docking and repairs. None of the
bottom plates were broken, but the
enormous strain had started the rivets
and seams, and two strakes of bottom
plates amidships had to be removed on
each side for a distance of 100 feet. The
repairs were calculated to take six
weeks and to cost about $100,000. The
dock in which the Leviathan lies is
designated as dock No. 1 and is the
largest of three completed at the dock
yard. It is 560 feet in length, 85 feet
wide at entrance and has 29 feet depth
over sill at ordinary spring tide. These
docks arc located At Kowloon, on the
mainland opposite Hongkong, where
work is now progressing extending the
dock yard, increasing its area from '4?i
acres to 3IH4 acres. ; These improve
ments are calculated to cost $6,000,000
and are approaching completion, in
cluding a granite drydock 550 feet in
length, which will be ready for service
in another year.
In addition to Great Britain's enor
mous expenditures on the navy proper,
which have risen from $S5,000.000 in
1S94-95 to over $180,000,000 for the pres
ent financial year, the home country
and its colonies expend large sums un
der the so-called naval works act for
inclosure and defense of harbors, adapt
ing naval ports to present needs of .the
fleet and on naval barracks. The total
sum expended for such purposes since
1S95 is nearly $65,000,000. and as much
more will be required to complete the
work by 190S. Only a small portion of
this outlay is included in the naval es
timates. . Among the most costly im
provements and new works going on
are the Keyham dockyard extension,
estimated at $20,000,000; Gibraltar, $13,
000.000: Simons Bay. South Africa. $12.
000,000; Dover. $17,000,000; Malta, $6,000,
000. and Portsmouth naval barracks,
$3,COO,000.
TORPEDO-BOATS NOT SAFE.
Two battleships, denominated as O
and P, are to be laid down for the
German navy at an early date. They
arc of the Braunschweig class, of which
five have been launched since 1902, and
one is nearly ready for floating, mak
ing a total of eight battleships of the
same tonnage, dimensions, speed and
armament. As these ships were built
two at one time various minor changes
and improvements were introduced and
the two new vessels will carry heavier
armor and batteries than earlier ships
of the game class. They are to be of
13,200 tons normal displacement, 338.63
feet in length, 72.83 feet beam and 25.23
feet mean draught, carrying 800 tons
coal on normal draught and have a
bunker capacity of 1600 tons of coal and
liquid fuel. The main belt" armor Â«is
9.45 inches maximum thickness, dimin
ishing to 5.9 inches and 3.9 inches at
the ends; the above water belt is 8
inches and the casemate 6.7 inches.
The armament consists of -four. 11-inch
guns, ten 6.7 inch in battery, four 6.7
inch in casemate and twenty-two 14
pounders, besides five - submerged and
one above-water torpedo tubes. Like
all the prior ship3 of the class thsy
are to have triple-screw engines of
16,000 horsepower, giving a speed of 18
knots, but the new ships are to bs
fitted with water tube boilers alone,
twelve of the Thornycrott-Schultz type
to be substituted for the previous prac
tice of part water tube and cylindrical
boilers. The estimated cost of each
ship is 53,750,000.
A board of United States naval en
gineers appointed to examine the mer
its of ' turbine propulsion for vessels
has concluded its work and is preparing
its report, which will be in favor of
adopting the turbine for the new
scouts. The advantages over present
machinery now in use is -a complete ab
sence of vibration,' a . most important
consideration in gun pointing and com
fort of the crew;- no pounding of en
gines; reduction of the engine-room
force; additional coal capacity, due to
a reduction of weight in machinery,
a:Â» the lowering of the center of grav
ity because the motors are placed Just
above the Moor plates. The difficulty
of reversing from going ahead to back
ing has been overcome and the entire
system is highly commended.

FORT GIBSON. Indian Territory,
p^pt. 4.â The remains of Talihina, the
once beautiful Indian maiden who was
the wife of General Sam Houston,
Â¦were removed to the National Cemetery
at this place to-day from the old
burial ground at Wilson Rock, where
they have rested since her death long
years ago. The removal was made
under authority of the United States
Government-
Houston came direct to the Cherokee
t"\vn of Tahlonteeskce. situated at the
mouth of the Illinois Bayou, thirty-five
miles below Fort Gibson, when he sud
denly left Tennessee. John Jolly, the
pub-chief of the Cherokee tribe, adopt
ed him as his son. He took the Indian
name of Coionnch, or the Raven.
A few months after Houston took up
his residence with Chief John Jolly he
met and fell in love with Talihina. She
i.as a haJfbreed and is said to have
bt-en very beautiful in face and form.
They became husband and wife accord
ing to the tribal laws.
In 1S3Q. only a few months after
Houston took up his residence with the
< "herckecs. he visited Washington at
the hoad of a delegation of prominent
members of his tribe to protest against
â¢ Â¦crtain outrages and swindling to
which he claimed they had been sub
ject at the hands of agents and con
trattcrs. Hie revelations of the swindl
ing which had been carried on and
the way in which the Cherokees had
been victimized caused a profound stir.
Leaving Washington Hc-uston return
ed to his Indian home, where he led a
dissolute life until the early part of
March. 1S32. when he was again sent
;â¢> Washington by the Cherokees on a
matter of business. Soon after his ar
rival In Washington Congressman Wil
liam Stanberry of Ohio took occasion
to make a severe attack on General
Houston and President Jackson. Hous
ton sent a note to Stanberry asking if
he had used the language in his speech
as reported. Stanberry ignored the
note and Houston, meeting him on the
street, gave him a severe drubbing.
When he thought he had drubbed him
enough he coolly walked off.
Houston's admirers on the frontier
cave him a warm welcome upon his
return to his home near here and not
the least of these welcomes was that
accorded him by his half-breed Indian
wife. Talihina. The loving greeting
Â« hich she gave him was such a de
parture from the usual stolid love of
The Indian that the incident is still
talked about in the households of the
Cherokees.
Houston took his departure for Texas
on December 10. 1SC2. Nothing is known
<if the farewell scene with his beauti
ful Indian wife. Talihina. Without
saying anything to his Indian friends
he silently rode off on a little Indian
jH>r.y ard made his way to Texas,
â¢a here he met the leaders of the brave
hand of men who were striving to free
ihct domain from Mexico. What he
accomplished during the next thirty
years of his life is a matter of his
tory.

Details are given showing that in the
last two years the county of Silver
Bow has been robbed of hundreds of
thousands of dollars by fictitious- and
fraudulent claims, including expenses
for pleasure trips to New York, guns
and ammunition for hunting, the build
ing of private roads and the carrying
of private employes on the pay roll of
the road department.
Commissioner Peoples is accused of
being a self-confessed bribe taker. It
is said he admitted before the Grand
Jury that he had received $1000 for vot
ing to award a county printing con
tract to the Butte Miner Publishing
Company, Senator W. A. Clark's news
paper. The Grand Jury says Peoples
seemed to take pride in the fact that
he Â¦ got the money, and considered it
legitimate, because the money was not
taken from the county, but came from
the treasury of Senator Clark's com
pany. By the contract the county has
been paying $9000 a year more than it
would have paid if other bids had been
accepted.
The Grand Jury recommends that A.
A. Cosman, the County Auditor, be re
moved from office for neglect of duty in
having permitted the county to be
robbed. ..

to the City Hall Station. Sergeant
Tobin, who-was in charge at the sta
tion, sent ; Policeman Cornelius with
Grisnell. to. the Central Emergency
Hospital, where Grisnell told the story
of having â¢ been robbed and clubbed

Sixth street, near Mission. After sup
per he escorted the women to their
home. Then he started out to find
the Winchester Hotel and several peo
ple he , asked < told him he was going
in the' right direction. Instead of

First of all, the school was formed
as an integral part of the compulsory
education' law. Before the establish
ment of the school the habitual truan
cies were reported by principals to the
truant officers, who thereupon set out
to gather up the lads. Upon capture
they were reinstalled in the schoolroom
only to repeat the act on the morrow.
After a time these lads were given up
as hopeless, as they Interfered with
the routine of school work and were
dropped â dropped to become vagrants
and to prey upon the public. Now,
there are the ladsâ forty-five of themâ
that have been interested sufficiently to
come to school every day, and what is
more, to manifest that interest by
working cheerfully within it.
How? Ah, good friend, love and tact
and human sympathy lie at the bottom
of parental school methods, when the
"good" in the lads is reached and ap
pealed to. It takes specialists to do it,
even as it takes specialists to treat
your body when it's ill. for these chil
dren of the street are ill â morally and
mentally ill â from heredity, environ
ment or acquired physical deficiencies.
Xow that the school is a reality the
California Club, the Associated Chari
ties, the juvenile court committee and
all the allied friends of children are
truly" grateful to the Board of Educa
tion for this enlightened step â which,
however, is only a beginning.
A dormitory is needed to complete
the training of many truant ladsâ lads
to whom "'home" has come to mean a
place where "his folks," as they term
them, meet to- sleep, drink, eat and
fight. But all things will come in good
time when the cause is just.
The Board of Education possesses
seme good lots out by the Golden Gate
Park. Here would be an ideal place
for a Parental Home, one such as
Chicago. Boston. Philadelphia and New
York possess. Here the boys could be
taught gardening and the elements of
trades, combining elementary, school
work with hand work â all of which
would greatly assist in the upbuilding
of new brain tissue, new thoughts* new
ideals and new boys. And success to
it! Likewise to its friends!
The secret of this? Just ask Mr.
Faulkner, or his assistant teacher, Miss
Ray Alexander. Or better still, go out
some day to the little schoolhouse on
Eighth street and see for yourself.
The best bit of literature that has
been committed to print these many
moons was the report submitted to
Superintendent Langdon on the new
Parental School by Principal Richard
D. Faulkner and read to the members
of the Board of Education c-n Thurs
day.
Xot that the diction was especially
distinctive â not that. It was couched
in good old Anglo-Saxon, simple and
direct as becomes official reports, with
few "whereases" and "therefc-res" . in
Its structure ard very like hundreds
of other reports passed up monthly at
the City Hall.
But in every line there runs a tense
human interestâ and therein lies its
honest claim to literature. Besides, it
deals with children, and the type of
children that most concerns us, because
they have passed parental control and
who are now at the turning of the
roads that lead to goed citizenship or
on to the embattled walls of criminal
ity. For it is known â and definitely
known â that from the ranks of the
habituaj truant are recruited the men
who fill the Jails. Reared o:i the street,
the brain cells are fed on the pabulum
of the street, the mind creates its
ideals from the street.
Therefore is the Parental School
only a few weeks oJd, it is true, but
according to that "bit of literature," it
is sheltering forty-five boys within its
gates and actually "holding" them.
Forty-five lads have been rounded
up from as many neighborhoods who
have sorely perplexed the inhabitants
thereofâ and incidentally the policeman
âhe-used together in school, with dead
things called books to deal with and
coming to school daily of their own
volition. Â¦ ,
"These forty-five boys," says Mr.
Faulkner, whom the lads have grown
to know Â«as their friend, "have been at
tending regularly since their individual
enrollment, with but cne exception.
That defection was but for a, day."

Coffee Drinkers Want It Stronger and
Stronger.
"I Lave be~n a hard coffee drinker
all mjr life." rays a Pittsburg: man,
' and the longer I used it the stronger
I wanted itâ two or three cups at each
inea!. At times shortly after meals I
â¢.vould be in dlstresB, v.-ould spit up
large mouthfuls of bitter, yellow stuff
and would have sharp pains ir. my
the?t end feel dizzy and water would
run" out cf nsy eyes and nose. My
rr.cihcr kept tcllins me it was because
I drank coffee, but I did not believe
her, for I thought I could not eat a
me.il without my coffee.
"Finally I cot so bad I had to lay off
â¢vorking entirely. One day I saw a
Posfum article in a pap?r that made
me think and to'd mother to get a
package and we would try it. At first
St was not boiled enough and tasted
flat, but next dsy it v.as made better
and I got to liking it better and better
and in a few days I told mother not to
make any more coffee, that Postum
was better. Oh. how glad I am I
found Postum. I am a different man,
my troubles gone and know I can
thank Postum for it, for I am back at
work again, strong and healthy. â¢
"I had a tlccx friend that was a cof-
fee drinker and I could see he was not
well. Or.c <Iay he did not come to
v.ork and that r.ight I called on himâ
he was walking around looking like a
â¢wreck. I told him I thought I would
find him in bed soon, but hÂ« paid, 'Xo.

dropped a hand , mirror, shattered It

simply felt that something was going
to happen to that train.
"Surely enough, I was right. An hour

The theatrical season is so near at
hand that the lovely lace waists recent
ly unpacked in the best shops are at
tracting much atetntion. Nothing pret
tier or more appropriate than these
waists has been offered â that is, unless
the esthetic sense eschews the separate
waist altogether. Doubtless that is
what it should do, but the blouse is so
convenient and so well adapted to the
great mass of women who go to the
theater in public cars that nothing
seems to take its place. The lace waist
is esthetically more satisfying than any
othen Almost any tint of lace and al
most any variety Is allowable. All-over
Valenciennes inset with motives of
heavier lace are especially smart. By
contrast with this delicate lace, waists
of heavy filet, such as upholsterers use
in their finest curtains and hanging?,
are seen. One of these was a handsome
garment, the collar and sleeves inset
with motives of old linen embroidery,
and the waist itself finished with a
trlmminjr of hand-made heavy fringe.â

kid or buckskin modeled upon the

The riches of Mayfair are never
more plainly proved than by the jewels
of its women. Tiaras are the rule and
not the exception; every bride expects
at least a couple. But it seems not im
probable that another and lighter form
of diamond headgear will come into
fashion.
The Marchioness of Granby has sev
eral times worn a net of diamonds, the
beautiful Lady Beatrice Pole-Carew
wears a bandeau of brilliants and the
young Duchess of Roxburghe appeared
at a dinner this season with wings of
diamonds in her dark hair.
Diamond shoulder straps are among
the latest modes. They have . been
adopted by Princess Henry of Pless,
the Duchess of Marlborough and the
Hon. Mrs. Ivor Guest. Mrs. Ivor Guest
ha? worn as a charming substitute for
the orthodox tiara a pair of diamond
leave?, the tips. of the leaves meeting
above 'her brow.
Colored stones seem rapidly increas
ing In popular favor. Rubies, emeralds,
sapphires and even amethysts have
been greatly to the fore during the past
six months. In this we are uncon
sciously imitating the court of St. Pe
tersburg, as the women of the Russian
aristocracy are far more noted for their
colored stones than for th?ir pearls and
diamonds.
The Duchess Marie of Saxe-Coburg
Gotha possesses some of the finest ru
bies in the world. Among other owners
of splendid rubies arc the Countess of
Dudley; the Countess of Stradbroke,
Mrs. Bradley Martin. Mrs. Arthur
James and Lady Wini borne, who often
wears a famous single stone of great
value, known as the Hope ruby.
The finest single diamonds known to
the world of Mayfair society are the
"Star of South Africa." which belongs
to the Countess of Dudley, a great dia
mond called the "Neska," worn by the
Duchess of Westminster, and the

WHILE San Francisco views a certainty that the present water
supply will not be sufficient for the future demands of this
city, the city of Los Anjjeles has a more acute and imminent
water trouble to lace. A proposition to brinjj an injunction suit
against the land-owners of the San Fernando Valley and surround
ing water^ied. an area aggregating: about rive hundred square miles,
is one of the moves ihat has grown out of a local appreciation of the
Mjuthern emergency.
Los Angeles claims title to all the water of the Los Angeles
River, surface and underground, under the terms of an old Spanish
law. As defined by the Los Angeles Times, this does not actually
give Los Angeles the ownership of, the water, but only the control
thereof. While the courts would undoubtedly determine, as the
result of le^al proceedings, just what the position of Los Angeles is
in relation to the water, the Los Angeles Times raises the question
whether it is wise to-proeecd in the injunction matter.
As it is reasoned out. horticulture is the most important of the
resources of Southern California, and it has brought the majority
of people as residents to that section. The Times savs that it
has caused the city of Los Angeles to increase in population from
10.000 to 150.000 in twenty-five years. Of the $100,000,000 worth
of products to be credited to the seven southern counties in 1903 at
feast S50.000.000 represents the horticultural output. Therefore, to
enjoin the horticulturists in the country surrounding Los Angeles
from using the water that makes cultivation of fruits possible is
termed "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs."
The fact in plain view is that Los Angeles needs more water for
its own uses. If it shall surrender its claim to all the water of the
Los Angeles River, or fail to have the right legally determined, it
mast take some step to procure the required supply in some other
direction. The alternative is to bring in water- from the mountains.
even, so says the Times, "if we have to pipe it one hundred miles."
A large reservoir system has been constructed by private capital in
the San Den:arrf:no Mountains. Kern County has great values in
water that may be used. One suggestion is an issue of bonds to '
provide money to bring in water from a distance. 7*1
San Francisco, it will be observed, is not the only. California
city that has a water problem on hand. Municipal growth and
municipal health are insecure unless there is sufficient water avail
able to meet all wants â hygienic, mechanical, for protection against
rire. for drinking and for irrigation. Xo doubt Los- Angeles and San
Francisco will, alike, provide a proper solution for the questions that
confront them. It is interesting that the same sort of problem is
encountered by the two chief cities of California at the same time.
The dressmakers of Paris, in. high conference assembled, re
cently decreed that to protect themselves from being pirated by
American rivals they would keep their styles a secret until the very
day of a new season's opening. Though the obtuse masculine mind
may not comprehend, there is really more here than meets the eye.
What a fruitful source of teapot tempests is the stealing of a new
style fair woman only knows. *

In the "agony column" of a New York paper there recently ap

ALL ABOUT A HATPIN.
Oh, Reginald Van Buren lived
A very happy life.
Until one day a gift he bought
And gave it to his wife.
The gift was just a hatpin, but
The head was an odd tint.
A sort of brown enamel with
A lovely reddish glint.
Was Reggie's wife delighted? Well.
Delighted! âshe was that!
She cried. "To match this hatpin, why.
I'll have to have a hat!"
She got a hat to match the pin;
To match the hat. a veil:
And now we are but started on
This very thrilling tale.
To match the veil she got son? gloves;
To match the gloves a purse;
And from that moment, really.
Things went from bad to worse.
To match the purse she got a skirt;
To match the skirt a waist;
To match the waist she got a cloak.
All chosen with good taste.
To match the hatpin, then she bought
Innumerable things.
From lingerie to things you see.
From shoestrings up to rings.
To match this toilette all complete
The parlor was arranged;
To match the parlor, next the house
From basement up was changed.
'..i--.. '..><!Â¦> c-.-.v.
But when this transformation scene
Was finished and complete.
The dear dame thought the dwelling
place
"Was better than the street.
And so she found a street to match
Her dwelling and her gown;
And then. "Alas, alack!" she cried.
â¢The street don't match the town!"
Poor Reginald Van Buren stormed.
While Mrs. Reggie cried;
She got hysterics, got quite 111.
And pined away and died. -
L'Envoi.
So. husbands, now take warning all.
Unless you'd live In strife.
Give any mortal present but
A hatpin to your wife.
âLtppincott'â
TRADE conditions last week were irregular and unsettled. Some
lines showed a slight expansion, others contraction. The gen
eral result, as exhibited by the bank clearings, was a gain of
8.9 per cent over the corresponding week in 1903. with the gains and
losses about equally distributed among the dozen largest cities.
The failures were 222, against 181 for the same week last year, and
those during August were more numerous than during July, while
the liabilities were larger than for the corresponding month in 1903.
Against this unfavorable exhibit of failures, however, were increased
railway earnings, the gain in August being, 1 .4 per cent over August,
KJO3- This is a very small gain, but it is better than a loss of 6 or 8
per cent, which ruled for some months, as it shows an increase
of about 8 per cent in railway business over the spring and early
summer months.
The foreign commerce at Xcw York last week was smaller than
a year ago, the exports decreasing $307,000 and the imports $905,
000. The customs receipts fell off S3.0G0.000 in August.
The above are the statistics of the situation. The apparent facts
on the surface, as viewed by the eye. show no material change from
the conditions of the past month or two. The condition of the crops
continues the overshadowing factor, and it is satisfactory as a rule.
Xo further damage has been sustained by the wheat crop, while
the corn and cotton crops are full of promise. The Government re
port for September 1 places the condition of the cotton crop at 84.1,
as compared with 01 .0 for July and 81.2 for September 1. 1903.
These figures indicate that the cotton yield may exceed the pre
vious records of 1 1,2.25.000 bales produced in 1S97 and 1898, as the
acreage is 10 per cent larger than in either of those years, while the
crop condition is 5 points better. There has been some deterioration
since August 25. the date of the compilation, however, which must
be taken into consideration. But on the whole the crop conditions
of the cdimtry arc very good, and financial and commercial circles
are anticipating a fair trade for the coming year in consequence.
As every day now places the three or four great crops of
the country just so much more out of danger, confidence in the
future is beginning to manifest itself in a corresponding degree.
Buyers of general merchandise are still cautious and disposed to
confine the major part of their purchases to supplying their actual
spot necessities, but they are beginning to place larger orders for dis
tant deliveries, which is a sign of increasing confidence. Thus, in
the case of dry goods, stocks have been reduced below the normal,
and fall shipments are showing some expansion. Wool is generally
firm throughout the country, and operators are generally of the
opinion that stocks will bring full* prices. t>ut California buyers,
who have lately been purchasing freely, have withdrawn from tke
field, being deterred from further purchasing at present by the high
prices demanded by the wool growers. The hide markets are quiet.
< Iroccries arc reported in fair movement almost everywhere. The
lumber trade is reported gradually working into' better condition,
though the improvement is slow, and is partially caused by the
cutting down of production, which is not a good sign.
The labor situation is not as settled as could be desired. The
meat strike in the West is still a disturbing factor there, and in New
York there is a complication in the building trades which tends to
unsettle matters.
The situation in Wall street is showing more tone. A good deal
of the idle money which has lately attracted so much attention is
now taking the dividend-paying stocks, and the public is slowly re
turning to the market, which is causing a gradual advance all along
the line. This may explain the increase of 16.8 per cent in the
bank clearings of the metropolis during the past week. The senti
ment in Wall street has become decidedly optimistic and bullish of
late, and there is more disposition to invest in standard stocks than
for some time. London has become more interested in American
securities, and large orders have also been received from several
foreign countries! Altogether, the tone of the national stock market !
is healthier than for some time past.
Conditions on the Pacific Coast remain about as before stated.
The crops, while rather below early expectations, are generally turn- j
ing out very well, and as prices for wheat, barley, oajs. wool, hops, <
potatoes, hay. butter and eggs, and in brief almost everything pro- 'â¢
duced on the farm, are above the normal, there is nothing now in !
sight to indicate anything else than another year of prosperity.

I .am sorry that J' could not deliver the
eijJening. address, but I was well pleased witfi
the. scntinwnts expressed in such an eloquent
marin>r Â«t- my request by the reverend
speaker. I can only repeat which the father

unity of the Cf-rman people, and I pray to Al
mighty Gcd that he may -bless those words
and that they may bring fruit. See what has
already been accomplished. You came from
all portion* of this State. You differ in your
ideas and politics, on business and other mat
ters, but you are united. on the one Important
thing of building up your religion nnd the
kingdom of God. It is a consoling sight to mu
to see theee men gathered here to deliberate
only in matters of the soul. Be always united
in the great family of God and help to build
up the churches.

The young, m.an .who, measures his services
by the pay he . receives will never Â»te his
name on the letterhead of the concern.
Secretary of the Treasury Leslie M.
Shaw addressed the members of the
Young Men's Christian Association
first at their hall on Mason street in
the afternoon and at Grace. Methodist
Church, at the corner of Twenty-first
and Capp streets, in the evening. The
Secretary's remarks were on the sub
ject of a young man's work and how to
do it if he would succeed in life. The
speaker said in part:
I presume most young men are exercised
more or lc?s over the choice of a position, a
profession or an occupation. It makes no
difference what a man does, providing he has
aptitude sufficient to enable him to do the
work better than it is being done. I know ot
a ehief cook in a big hotel receiving a salary
cf $10,000 a years and I know of another who
gets $'Jo a month. I have sampled the product
of both, and I think the $25 man ia overpaid.
A business man in this city yesterday told me
that men worth S1S00 and (2000 a year were
plentiful, but that it was difficult to find a
?K\CCO man. lioys, qualify for the |10,CO(>
job. .
Have one idea â a oicd business one â and
follow it. Look, at Edison, the wizard. He
forgtts everything on earth but his Inventions,
and the world wonders at his triumphs.
I wish you could realize how poorly the
work of the world is done. The average man,
after years in his business, is not doing his
work any better than when- he began. A
prominent jurist once told me that ho knew
twenty lawyers who could not handle a case a*
well as when they first came > from the law
school. Men do .'not fait for want of knowl
edge-, but because they violate the first condi
tion of success." The, World lsvwilling to pay
for excellence. '- 1 would pay. my -'own fare to
see the grave of the man, who" died from over
work, and I have seen whole cemeteries full of
those who passed away dodging industry.
Young man,, work for your employer. Render
two dollars' worth of work for every dollar
you get, and my. 'word for It, some one will
discover you." ~-v.
That "Sapho" still has charm for the
theater public v was strongly evidenced
at the California last, evening, when -a
large crowd Â¦ enthusiastically greeted
Florence Roberts in the role of Fannie
La Grande and bestowed ; on Lucius
Henderson his well merited" share oÂ£
applause for his splendid interpretation
of the character of Jean Gaussin.. The
cast of "Sapho" 1 throughout is good
and one that- reflects credit *'on Miss
Roberts,, whose .judgment usually takes
precedence . over, that of : others of, her
company, in assigning, roles. /\ She. , is
well supported In this week's produc
tion, which has every assurance of en
joying a successful -run,-, i V^ V ' ' ' .'
The customary crush was, in. evidence
at both performances at the Orpheum
yesterday afternoon and last night, and
every feature- of the new programme
was well received. The "Great Singing
,Four," as the Mendelssohn quartet of
Denver Is known, made a hit with
their high-class and poular selections.
"New ~i ear's Eve in Bohemia" is the
.medium, for their introduction to San
Francisco, and their delightfully blend
ed voices made as good music as has
been heard on the Orpheum 'stage for
many a day. . , .
Burton and Brooks offer a clever lot
of conversational nonsense. in their skit,
,"A Can of Humor," while the recita
tion of "Dandy Jim," with a musical
setting, by Mr. Brooks brought the
moisture to many an eye." '
The three Mitchells, entertainers of a
dark hue, are as limber-limbed dancera
as have been seen here' for, Some time.
The man. puts unusual unction 'in his
songs, the woman is graceful and pleas
ant to look upon and j the J child has a
voice that nearly raises the roof..
The gem of the programme is~"Drift
wood," played by Eva Williams- and
Jac Tucker, who made such a hit in
"Skinny's Finish" during the/ past, two
-weeks. ..It < Is quite as clever and .orig
inal as their first effort.- / , ; ,; -I '.
Mr.' and Mrs. Alfred "Kelcy : revived
'"Uncle Thineas," a one-act comedietta,
in which they made i-a hit on a former
visit; Paul Barnes offered a lot' of- new
parodies and stories, and Klein and
Â¦ Clifton, the eccentric singers and
dancers, and "Our Boys in Blue" com
pleted an unusually strong bill. There
will be a matinee every day at the Or
pheum this week.

By this lime Short had disappeared.
A thorough starch of the town was

evading his pursuers.
Wlliits lilt San Rafael for San Quen
tin on the 1:45 train. He got off at
Greenbrae and as the train pulled out
he again saw Short crouched on the
last platform. The officials at- th^i
prison were notified and every effort
was made to apprehend the fugitive,
but in vain. Warden Tompkins thinks
Guard WillltS had mistaken Short for
some other person.
Willits was off duty and : while
strolling aior.s Fourth street he saw
Short. Not being armed, he did not
care to approach the desperate man,
so he notified Constables Hughes and
Agnew. ; .â¢ *'

The fire was soon extinguished and
the search for the dead began. Most
of the dead were found on the two
upper floors. While the search of the
building was going on four firemen
were at work on a fourth-floor bal
cony when it gave way. Another fire
man on the balcony floor below was
also carried down and was probably
fatally injured. The other four were
badly hurt, but will recover. Two of
them fell upon a pile of bedding in the
courtyard and their injuries were
caused chiefly by the iron work of the
balcony falling on them.
The fire is supposed to have been
caused by the explosion of a lamp that
had been left to light the hall on the
second floor and the sleeping tenants
were not aroused until the hallway was
ablaze and escape through the building
cut off.
The fire started about 3 o'clock la
the morning and there was much de
lay In sounding an alarm, although the
district Is one of the most thickly pop
ulated In the crowded East Side of
Xew York. When the firemen reached
the scene some of the tenants were
jumping from the windows and from
the ends of the fire escapes that
reached only to the second floor. Others
were crouching in the smoke in the
small rooms and narrow halls.
NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â Fourteen per
sons were killed and nearly a score
Injured In a fire In a flve-story double
tenement m Attorney street early this
morning. The dead Include four
women, one man and nine children,
ranging In age from 3 months to 12
years. Many of the Injured were taken
to hospitals and It Is thought that
several of these will die. Among ths
Injured were five firemen, who were
in a fourth-floor balcony when It fell
with them.
The small number of men among tnÂ»
killed and injured was due to the fact
that most of the men who lived In the
building, following the Attorney-street
custom In hot weather, were asleep on
the roof, while but few of the women
arfd children were there. Those on the
roof were unable to escape by descend
ing through the burning building and
made their way to safety over neigh
boring roofs. Meanwhile .the members
of their families, who had remained in
their rooms found escape cut off and
panic reigned throughout the struc
ture. ' f -

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street. Sept. 4-
Careless handling ot a rifle in the
hands cf a careless boy hunter to-day
brought death to Chrales Nelson, 14
years old and living: at 20 Clara street.
San Francisco. Arnle Arvonen. aged
15 yeara, of 2 Alice street, San Fran
cisco, paused the accident- The scene
of the tragedy "was Wildcat Canyon.
Just over the Berkeley Hills, where five
other such tragedies have occurred
this summer.
The accident happened while the
youths were preparing to cook some
squirrels they had shot. Nelson was
on one side of the creek that runs
through the canyon, cleaning the
squirrels, and Arvonen was on the
other side, tampering with his rifle.
Suddenly it went off.- Just why Ar
vonen does not know. A second later
Nelson fell to the ground with 9 bullet
wound in the middle of his forehead.
The bullet had pierced the brim of his
felt hat and entered the brain.
As soon as they realized that Nelson
was shot Arvonen and a companion
rushed to his aid and bound a piece of
cloth around his head. They implored
him to speak, but he was already un
conscious.
E. B. Coy, a camper, responded to
a call for assistance and took the
wounded youth in a buggy to Dr. J.
Edson Kelsey's office in Berkeley. The
physician said that Nelson could not
recover and so did not send him to a
hospital.
Deputy Coroner J. E. Strelghtiff and
Deputy Marshal Howard are convinced
that the shooting was purely accident
al. Arvonen could not tell exactly how
the rifle, a 22-caliber weapon, was fired,
but thought it occurred while he was
trying to force the trigger mechanism
into place. He denied aiming the rifle
at Nelson in play. Arvonen was held by
the Berkeley authorities awaiting the
result of the wound.
Young Arvonen died to-night shortly
before midnight.

The programme at the Nelson camp,
at Gregson Springs, was much the
same. Nelson is just at weight. He is
a picture of health and ruggedness.!';
i Herrera Is still favorite here at 4 to

Nelson. These odds are expected to
shift when the Salt Lake sports arrive.

BUTTE, Mont., Sept. 4.â When Aure
llo Herrera and â¢.'Battling". Nelson clash
in the new arena of the Montana Ath
letic Club to-morrow afternoon a bat
tle will occur which will bring to the
front a new contender for the light and
feather weight championships of the
world. From a standpoint of class it
will be the greatest match ever decided
in Butte^ and a record-breaking crowd
will be at the amphitheater. The
matchmaker for the club expects the
attendance will be close to 10,000.
In contrast to the excitement in town
is the calm of the training-camps. Both
fighters took things easy to-day.- and
from the general air of tranquillity at
the quarters bne would never judge
that to-morrow afternoon would' mark
a crisis in their careers. Herrera did a
little work to-day. After his exercise
he just budged the scales at 129%

Threats of Angry Parish

Plucky Allegheny Priest
P1TTSBURG, Sept. 4.â After hewing
his way into the church with an ax,
Rev. Father Bekavac of St. Nicholas
Grc-atian Roman Catholic Church, Al
legheny, held early mass to-day while
a large number of his former congrega
tion awaited him- outsidp and made
frantic efforts to attack him at the con
clusion of the eceremony. He was
saved from violence only by the pro
tection of fifty policemen.
When Father Bekavac reached the
church he found all the doors locked
and nailed fast. Returning to his resi
dence he secured an ax and applied it
to one of the doors, while the police
aided him to force it down with the
weight of their bodies. The excitement
by this time had reached a high pitch
in the mob of probably 500 men and
women who had gathered to prevent
services being held. About fifty of
Father Bekavac's adherents attended
the mass.
At the conclusion of the ceremony
the police awaited Father Bekavac to
escort him to the parish house. At this
stage the mob became bolder and*
spurred on by bne or two women lead
ers, ascended the stone steps to the
church door and as the priest appeared
shouted threats of vengeance, while
wi;mtn and men alike called upon their
followers to attack him.
The police surrounded the priest and
with their maces fought back | the
crowd, finally landing their charge
safely in the parish house. Eight of
the mob leaders, three of whom are
women, were. taken to the central sta
tion in the patrol.
St. Nichoras Ohul-ch has been the
scene of factional disturbances for sev
eral months and the dissenters de
manded the removal of Father
Bekavac. charging misappropriation of
funds." Bishop Phelan upheld the priest
and ordered him to hold services to
day in spite of the protests. < -'f. : '''
BOSTON, Sept. 4â In a sudden fit
of insanity. to-day Mrs. Minnie McKen
zie tried to kill her husband at her
home on Falcon street, East Boston,
then shot and fatally woundei Patrol
man Alfred M. Sturdivant and finally
barricaded herself in Ahe front room
of her tenement, where she remained
for more than -five hours, standing off
a. squad of ten policemen. She was
finally captured by the use of germi
cide injected through holes in the bar
ricaded door.
When overcome by the fumes she
was found to be armed with two large
revolvers and a large amount of am
munition. During the barricade she
tired more than fifty shots, imperiling
a crowd of 5000 that had gathered about
the house. .
Mrs. McKenzie is 34 ye^s old and of
powerful frame. She became violently
insane soon after the dinner hour and
obtaining a revolver of heavy caliber
began shooting at her husband, but
none of the shots took erfect. McKen-.
zie notified the East Boston police sta
tion and four patrolmen were sent to
the house. When they arrived- Mrs.
McKenzie. had retired to a front room,
locked the door and barricaded it with
a .'bureau. â¢ . . â¢- Â¦ . .
The officers succeeded in getting the
door partly open, when the woman
thrust the muzzle of a revolver through
the opening and fired four shots, three
of the bullets striking Sturdivant. He
died in a hospital to-night.
A hurry call was sent to police head
quarters and a squad of ten policemen
was sent to the house, with instructions
to capture the woman without injuring
her. The police made repeated at
tempts, but every footfall in the hall
was the signal for a fusillade of shots
from the front room, the bullets passing
through the barricaded door. -A bullet
struck Patrolman John Burke, but the
wound is not serious.
At intervals the woman threw open a
window and fired into ttoe crowd on
the street, but so far as known none
of the onlookers was injured.
At. 9 o'clock 1 to-night a quantity* of
germicide was forced into the room .and
a few seconds later the frenzied woman
was captured.

LONDON, Sept. 4.â In' an interview
to-night Sir Thomas Lipton appeared
to. entertain some hope of inducing
George L. Watson to change his mind
and design a new challenger for the
America's- cup, which the designer
yesterday. decided, not to do, giving ill
health as the reason. Â¦ ; ; Â¦ .
. Sir Thomas said the difficulty, had
arisen owing to the fact that Mr. Wat-;'
son was unable to undertake the Jour
ney to the United States. He said,
he told the (Jesigner he would' be sat**
isfied with any deputy he would nbraH
inate to accompany, the boat, but^Mr.
Watson said he would never design "a*

company it himself. v v

G. M. Barley was high man among
the pistol shooters with a score of 5>0
and 87 rings, his nearest competitor
being F.J.Povey. with 84.' A friendly
match was shot on this target between
John Boiler and A. Hennings. On ac
count of the handicap the score proved
a tie; On the final trial J. Boiler proved
the victor by one ridfe. .
The usual large number of marks
men were not present at Schuetzen
Park yesterday, although the day was
an ideal one for 'rifle shooting. A.
Rahwyler, an old-time champion and
one of the survivors of the California
Centennial team, proved to his qpm
rades that he is still to be reckoned
with. In the medal competition of the
California Schuetzen Club he made the
high scores of 224 and 216 in each of
his 10-shot strings, making a total of
410 rings in his 20-shot score. , His
nearest competitor was A. C. Gehret
of the Grutll Club, who made 430 rings
in the Grutli contest and a score of 222
in the California Club. . He in turn was
closely followed by' Otto Bremer with
a score of 217.
Play will also we resumed In both
singles events. In the third round
Griffin and MacGavin and Variel and
Janes will meet. The latter stood 5â5
on the first set when the match was
called off Saturday. They will res%:riÂ»e
from this point.
In the 'lower half Miss Violet Sutton
and Mrs. Bruce will have an. easy time
reaching the finals, . and many think
they will win the champlonshfp.
The local players "will be outclassed
more in this event than in the sin.?!^
and will cut little or no figure.. The
Ratcliffe sisters play a steady game
and will make a good showing, but can
hardly hope to win.
In the lower "half Simpson Sinsabaugh
and Trowbridge Hendick look to be the
strongest team. They are the doubles
champions of Southern California and
have always been hard men to dispose
of. Three â¢ years ago they played to
gether at San Rafael and were beaten
in the. finals by Smith and MacGavin
after four stubbornly contested sets.
They will probably run up , against
Murdock- and MacGavin in the finals.
Another team in this half that should
not be overlooked is- Will Allen and
George Baker. Both play ! a steady
game and It would not be a surprise \'
tl:ey win a place in the finals. Long
and Janes have also come to the. front
os a doubles team and may prove a
stimitllng block to some, of the beat
teams. S.mith and Smith are also in
this half, but it i3 doubtful if they
will play. Neither is in practice and
they expect to play only one match.
There are seven teams in the wo
men's doubles and some of the matches
will undoubtedly be weir worth seeing.
Miss May Sutton will be seen her? for
the first time since her conquest- of the
East. She will undoubtedly attract
many spectators, as her reputation is
world-wide. She will play with Miss
Seymour, and when they meet Miss
Dobbins and Miss Florence Sutton a
close match will result. Miss Seymour
is hardly as clever as- the other three,
b-'t v.-ith the national champion on her
side of the net she- ought to be able to
give a good account of herself.
The tennis players took a day of rest
yesterday from work on the courts.*
After two hard days of play and with
a weeTc of it ahead of them they felt
they could afford to take matters eas
ily. As most of the players are across
the bay the courts in this city were
practically deserted. The poorer play
ers'at the part had an lnnins. but tha
attendance at the California Club wajs
light.
Tournament play will be resumed to
day at San Rafael. Both the men's,
and women's doubles will be started.
In the former event twenty teams will
compete. This is by* far . the largest
number that ever entered a champion
ship doubles event. Bell and Freeman.'
the present champions, will not defend
and the title will go to the tournameac
winners. Of the twenty teams entered
Drummojd MacGavin and Percy Mur
dock appear to have the best chance
to win. They, are In the half with Eu
gene Overton and H. "Elliott. ' The lat
ter is said to play better doubles than
singles. He made a fair showing
against Hendrick in the singles but
will have to do better to beat men like
MacGavin and Murdock. The latter,
if they play their best game, shouid
win first honors. They will probably
have some trouble disposing of Overtoil
and Elliott, but should reach the finals.
Whitney and- Griffin may double up
well, but It is hardly likely they will
win out.

MISS SUTTOX TO APPEAR
The in and out combination was ex
ploded yesterday on the baseball dia
mond. The Brownies had been handing
it to the Commuters every other "game
up to that time, but the Oaklanders
passed them the double cross twice.
It was easy at Oakland and easier
here. The scores were 3 to 1 in the
morning and 7 to 2 at the Eighth-street
lot. "i
The men under Dugdale's charge
were beaten on the square, even
though they helped out their own
downfall, while the small Sunday
throng rooted- against them. They
managed to get" in wrong during the
initial spasm and after that time they
never' did get right. They could not
hit and Mr, Steelman absolutely re
fused to peg to the bases! so Oakland
had to win whether it was its policy or
not.
Mr. Buchanan,- as usual, was the big
Buffalo. Although the Brownies, at
times waxed. busy with their clubs, the
man from Texas had, no fears. He was
the master and *it went at that. He
eased up enough toward the latter part
of the game to let them get a run
and Mr. Devereaux's generosity con
tributed one more that should .not
have been. Â¦.-.Â¦..
For a long time Mr. Skelligan Roach
has been due for a walloping. He got
his yesterday, Not. a thing in Skel's
collection was a deceiver when the
Commuters had bats to swing. They
practically broke* it all up ere the game
had started well and every inning or
so another run j was. annexed just to
show they were still ready to work. J
Francks opened up the Jackpot for
the Oaklanders in the first with a hit.
Clynes did a bush league trick ' by
throwing the ball away at first and
this advanced Buck. Ganley had lit
tle-trouble in beating out a bimt. but
Schlafiey and Dunleavy went out, mak
ing it look . good for the Brownies.
Roach, however, slumbered a bit too
Ions and while he was partaking of
the siesta Ganley stole second., Kru
ger swung through and so did Dev
ereaux after Streib had been passed.
The total damage was four. It was
a good lead and the Brownies never
offered to overtake it, for they never
had a chance.
Oakland added three more to her
share in the. succeeding innings, most
ly through banging the offerings oÂ£
Mr. Roach where fielders did not romp.'
Devereaux's two successive misplays
in the fourth, coupled .with Steelman's
drive to right, let the Brownies get
one and a base on balls and a couple
more hits allowed another in the
eighth. 'â¢
The game was full of good individual
work. Francks' pulled off a few plays
; that, ho other, shortstop in this- league
could have accomplished. Ganley soused
safely four times out of four chances
with the timber. Jack O'Conneff um
pired his last game, for to-day ho
will retire for the balance of the sea
son on account of illness.
*;There will be two games to-day. The
first will be called at Oakland at 10:15
a. m. and the second at Recreation
Park at 2:45. so that the Portland
players may be enabled to catch the
owl: train for Los Angeles;. where thej'
will play this week. The score: â¢

The open stake, in which a lot of
clever performers started, was won
by W. T. Raught's Friendless Boy,

three to two. The most pronounced

liberally as he works them. They are
always noted for their stamina and
if ihey have a little natural speed they
are hard to beat. After trying Â¦ for
many years this is the first of the clas

stake was worth $500 to the win

Blaze showed great stamina, run
ning one course of one hundred sec

the edge being taken off his speed.
He was at his best in the â¢ deciding
course. Owing to the late hour at
which this was run " and to the fog

reached this city late at night and noti
fied the Spreckels Tug Company of the
accident. The Defiance arrived at the
scene early-yesterday morning, but the
Drumburton was wedged tightly on the
rocks and could not be pulled off.
INSURED FOR BIG SUM.
The Drumburtcr. is a first-class iron
ship, valued at 545.000. * She was in
sured for $33,000. She. had been . lying
idle in Oakland Creek for several
months awaiting a charter, which she
received only a few days ago. The ill
fated shin was to go north and load at
Port B!akaley with lumber for Valpa
raiso. She was built by Russell, in
Glasgow, Scotland, for Gillson & Chad
wick. . *. â¢
According to Captain Thomas, short
ly after the Drumburton was . freed
from the tug the fog: â¢ fejl like a pall
over her. The wind died down and she
drifted, a helpless hulk, at the mercy
of the current. â¢
"I had nothing to get my bearings
by," said Captain Thomas., The vessel
drifted through the white mist. Neither
captain nor crew knew whither or how
swiftly the ship was going. They were
utterly helpless. They heard nothing
but the splash of the waves against the
vessel's sides. They saw nothing but
fantastic shapes in the fog that seemed
to mock their bewilderment.
Praying for the friendly voice of a
fog horn or the sight of a light they
drifted through the gloom. The entire
Yosemite Vnlley.
Via Merced and the "Double Loop,"

gray, curtain of . mist. Voices shouted
out of the darkness. ' McGowan gave
an answering hail.
"Who are you?" he shouted.
"The ship Drumburton, fast aground,"
was the answer. "Where are we?"
"Off Point Pedro," 1 shouted Mc-
Gowan. ;
By this time quite a crowd congre
gated on the bluff. Mrs. McGowan, P.
J. Fleming- and his wife arrived, and
the four shouted encouragement to the
bewildered sailors. As the ship was
only fifty yards from shore voices could
be distinguished plainly.
E. J. Scott; a fisherman whose cabin
is built in the lee of the. bluff, near
where the doomed vessel lay, heard the
crash of the bombs. He Joined the
crowd on the bluffs with a lantern that
could be "distinguished faintly bv those
on board the ship. Â¦ . ' ' ' j
"Can't some one come, out with a
boat?" was shouted from the vessel.
"All right," answered Scott. He hur
ried to his cabin and launched a small
boat that he uses in his trade. Guided
by the shouts of the Drumburton's
crew and the flare of an .occasional
rocket, the intrepid fisherman ; rowed
through the darkness to the vessel's
eide and boarded her.
After a" hasty consultation ' Captain
Thomas decided to. send Second Mate
William McDonald 1 and a seaman
ashore to seek assistance. Scott, rowed
them back, j Luckily the sea was not
rough or the little fishing boat would
have been swamped. The mate was
taken to Colma in a livery rig, but
crew was on*deek peering into .'the fog
and listening for the terrifying crash
of breakers 1 that they expected/mo
mentarily. ; . * *. '.

wife waited beside her husband..' She
had left a hospital shortly prior ; to the
sailing that she might' accompany Cap
tain Thomas on the voyage.. She was
beside him when with a lurch the Dum
burton grounded on the rocks.-Plugg

that ..will be its tomb. There , was no
confusion when the shock came. >
The crew prepared to launch the
small boats, but as the ship remained
motionless even in the trough of the
sea, : Captain Thomas decided .that it
was perfectly safe to remain on board.
Steward Joe Plum sent up-rockets,
which attracted the attention of those
on shore. ; > ... .; ..

been secured Saturday night the Drum
burton might have been floated. -Now

coasting vessels. The ship's .bottom
is badly torn and the approach td; her
is so dangerous that all hope of. floating
her has been abandoned. Even Cap
tain Barneson is resigned to t ( he loss,
which is not great owing to the heavy

CAPTURES PICKPOCKET
WHO STOLE HIS PURSE
George Kelley Lays Hold of a Profcs
sional and "Turns Him Over
' to the Police.
Pickpockets .were in evidence yes
terday and were, plying their vocation
in a very strenuous manner. George
Kelley, who fcjj^connected with the
Spring .VallejffttdSter.Company, was on
his way to/;thafr>ark in an Oak-street
car, acconjpanrediljy several women,
when he/teltÂ» sofrie. one taking his
purse ., fr r qm*,T}te,po'cket. It was so
deftly dbiietpaf 'for a'few moments he
could, not, tfr(l "|yho it- was, as the car
was. crowded."' .rWhen ;the car reached
FJllmore : street- he 'noticed a general
movement, of several men to get off
the- car. 'He followed? them and saw
one man in, the crowd pass to another
something than V appeared t6 be his
purse. Kelley' grabbed the man. and
then shouted for the police. "Police
man W. D. Flinn j placed the fellow
under ar.rest. He gave his name as
Edward Ford. : He had $90 in. his pos
session, but Kelley's pbeketbook was
not recovered. Ford's confederate
who received it having escaped.
Kelley said that while he -was strug
gling with, the man Ford asked, "How
much money have you lost?" and said,
"If you will name the amount twill
make it good rather than have any
disturbance." . .
The police think from what they
have learned that Ford and his gang
arc- a lot of expert pickpockets from
the- East.
W. B. Levy and Thomas, Beatty were
arrested last night and placed on the
detinue book at the City Prison on sus
picion that they were concerned in
some of the many recent pickpocket
cases, that have been reported to the
police. They were exhibited,' with Ford,
last night to a number of the late vic
tims of the light-fingered gentry; but
were not identified. Beatty has been in
jail several times on suspicion iorXthe
same- off ens%. The police do not know
Levy, but believe that he is a pick
pocket because he was found in Beat
ty's company.
John Grady and Joe Watkins were
arrested last night by Special Police
man Patrick KindoHn of the Southern
Pacific Company and charged at the
Southern station with grand larceny.
The men are accused of having
snatched a purse from an unknown wo.
man on board an excursion train com
ing from San Jose.- While the special
officer was trying to place the men un
der arrest a stranger attempted to free
the men by placing a revolver to the
face of the ' officer. Several friends
came to the assistance of the latter,
but the wbuM-be rescuer escaped.
ijj The little steam schooner Maggie,
running between this port and Half Â»
moon Bay,' ran ashore near the Cliff
House last night - and is still wedged
in the sand,'. with the breakers pound
ing her heavily.
In the dense fog that' hung over the
entrance to â¢ the Golden Gate Captain
Thomas Rogan of 1 the Maggie mistook
the lights of Boulevard station for those
of 'the Cliff House. He whirled his rud
der around to sail through what seemed
the entrance of the harbor. The little
vessel struck with % terrific shock and
remained imbedded in the sand.
. The crew of the life-saving station at
the beach rushed their boat through
the surf,and pulled to the rescue. They
found the captain # and crew of the
small craft unharmed. An 'anchor had
been dropped -and the Maggie's doughty
mariners were prepared to spend the
night in the pounding surf.
The tug Dauntless steamed as close
as possible to the grounded schooner,
but could render no assistance. The
current was running rapidly and the
Maggie. was close inshore.
Captain Hogan said: "We were
steaming up at half speed in the fog.
I saw some lights tÂ»a^ looked like the
Cliff House. I steered for what I
thought was the Golden Gate. The
next I knew we were on the sand."
Captain Hogan-is confident that the
Maggie can be extricated from her po
sition; but others are not so sanguine,
as a heavy sea is running. The Cap
tain and crew of seven men remained
with .the .vessel all night.
. The Maggie is a steam schooner of
100 tons. She has been making two
trips a day between this port and Half
moon Bay, carrying vegetables. The
craft is owned by the Stanell Company.
The captain's misreading of the lights
may mean" her destruction.
\\ itliin 36 hours . four vessels have
cone ashore near the entrance of San
Francisco Bay. A dense fos and un
accountable swiftness of currents are
given as the causes.
Here is a list of the disasters:
Three masted schooner James A.
Garneld, ashore 5 miles below the Cliff
House. Saturday, 6 o'clock a. m. Is
towed off.
Four masted steamer Drumburton
ashore on rocks near Point Pedro.
Saturday, 7 o'clock p. m. Will be a
total loss.
Steamer Newberg ashore near Fort
Point. Saturday, 8:30 o'clock p. m.
Is towed off.
Steam schooner Maggie ashore near
Cliff House. Sunday, 8 o'clock p. m.
Is still wedged in the sand.
The four-master iron ship Drumbur
ton lies Jammed on the rocks off. Point
Pedro. She was towed from this
port Saturday and set on her way to
Seattle. A dense fog settled upon the
ocean and in a dead calm Â»the ship
drifted with the current southward
through the white silence. At about 7
o'clock Saturday night she crashed bow
foremost on the rocky bottom of the
Point-
There is little hope of her being taken
off. A ragged hole is punched in her
hull and she is filled with water. The
vessel was sailing in ballast at the time
and the only loss sustained is about
J45.OO0. the value of the Drumburton.
This is offset by $38,000 insurance.
Captain William Thomas, the skip
per, seemed dared by the catastrophe
when interviewed yesterday.
"I don't know how it happened," he
said. "We're here. I wish we were not-
Lost my bearings? I had nothing to
take bearings by. We drifted and struck
on the rocks. That's all I know."
The Drumburton left port at 10 o'clock
Saturday morning. With Captain Reed
as pilot the ship was towed through
tbeOolden Gate, and spreading her
sails headed north.
The explanation given for her running
aground so far south is that the cur
rents bore her there. Captain Thomas
would mak<* no statement. The chief
ovrper. Captain John Barneson, is sat
isfied with the theory of the strong
currents. He says that it is plausible
that the vessel was carried down the
coast and sucked ashore by the same
treacherous : niEh of waters that ran
Th*> James A. Garfield ashore yesterday
and hurled the British bark Gifford on
the rocks a year ago. -
CAUL THROUGH THE FOG.
At about 7 o'clock Saturday night
th* inmates of the Point Pedro Hotel,
about a mile from this "graveyard of
ships,"' heard the boom of a rocket. J.
A. McGowan hurried down and ascend
ed the high bluff known as Little Pedro
Point. He could see nothing at first
through the heavy fog. Suddenly the
glare of a rocket flashed through the
