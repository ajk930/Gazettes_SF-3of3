not only the rejection of a pressmg de
mand by the whoie of the Norwegian
people, but, drawn up as' it -was in dis
regard of the â¢ Cn'binet's unanimous- ad
vice and without the "advice of any Nor
wegian, It was a breach of the constitu
tion and a violation of the constitutional
rights, Independence and sovereignty of
Norway and would- "mean dissolution of
the union. . No member of the Norwegian
Government, they v.gaid, could indorse
such a. decision- without from that mo
ment losing his 'fatherland.
The members of the : Cabinet having
presented their resignations, . King Oscar
.read his reply, declaring that' he. could
not accept them as it was clear that no
other Cabinet could be formed . at- the
present time. The Ministers, however,
-declined to withdraw their resignations.
,They had beforehand appealed to the
King to' defer action on the* matter until
It could be dealt '-frith In the full Council
at Chrlstianla, but the King < had an
nounced inability to acquiesce.. No pro
'tbcor "of \he proceedings was drawn ; up
as the Ministers' all - refused toÂ»counter
sign on& and the King's veto of the, law
therefore Is constitutionally non-existent.

CHRISTrANIA. May 25.-King Oscar'fe
veto of the separate consular law has
created a great eensation as possibly In
volving a dissolution of the union be
tween Sweden and Norway and perhaps
even international complications. Best
informed Norwegians decline to believe
that there is any danjjer of a Russian in
vasion, contending that if Russia had de
signs, which they do not believe she has,
she woulu not- be' deterred in pressing
them by bavingjp fight both Sweden and
Norway, and that. therefore the question
of. a dissolution of Jthe union /will .have no
effect from an international standpoint.
The King's decision was given in th'i
Norwegian Counell, sitting at Stockholm.
Each member of the Cabinet individually
urged the King to sanction the consul
law. When thj&y~all had spoken, King
Oscar reafl a declaration indorsing the
declaration made by the Crown, Prince,
on April 3 that the "matter was solvable
only by mutual negotiations. He added
that he could not give. his 'assent 'to "the
law because the existing community, of
interests in the consular service- could
not be abolished without mutual agreed
ment. The existing, arrarigemnt,. he said;
was established by a resolution of the
mixed Council and could only be 'disturb*
ed by the mixed Council and his love. for
both peoples Impelled him to withhold
his sanction. :â¢- , >

. VIENNA,. May 28.â The political sit
uation in Hungary, has passed within
the last few days from the passive stage
of recent months into a comparatively
acute stage that is threatening .really
serious consequences. Count Tisza, it
is said, will be removed from the Pre
miership next week and in" his stead
will be appointed, if -c can form, a
Cabinet, General Fejervasy, formerly
Hungarian Minister of Natjonal De
fence, which office he had- to. resign -be
cause of great unpopularity arising
from his extreme 'partisanship to the
crown in matters within his jurisdic
tion.
The rights guaranteed Hungarians
under their constitution, leading men
of thai? country say, are threatened by
the crown's action, and* the Hun-,
garians' are preparing to contest the
infringement in a manner, which holds
the possibility of bringing serious re
sults to' the" mutual life of the dual
monarchy. '* â¢

The struggle in Hungary can fairly
be called in- its broader outlines an
energetic affirmation of popular rights
against the undue prevalence of the
royal prerogative. 'â¢
The country Is thoroughly aroused
with a view to protecting Its most
sacred institution against army assault.
The Fejervasy Ministry would be
colorless and neutral and composed of
members of the minority. In this sense
it would be unconstitutional and sharp
ly attacked by the combined majority.
It will be 'immediately 'discredited rand

. PARIS,%May "' 28.â -The.<; Chajhber of
Deputies, afterÂ«"-a * three days* heated
discussion, adopted article VI of -the
church- and state separation bill:/. *' The
article is considered objectionable by
the opposition, as it. leaves the; decision
of disputes regarding the' handing over
of churches with departmental authori
ties instead of civil courts.; as the
clause originally provided. It" is alleged
that >this will r lead to political in

The approaching separation has dis
closed .a "curious situation, whereby
Christmas, i Easter and other, holidays
to . whiclv tho'i French are devoted j will
be abolished under the separaticTh bill.
This led M. Gerault-Richard to satisfy
public opinion by an amendment con
tinuing, the principal holidays under
new -names. -Â« The . amendment, .which
has .been (accepted by those 'In charge
of the bill, substitutes Spring' Flower
Festival for Easter. Harvest Festival
for the Feast of the Assumption. Memo
rial Festival for the Feast of All Saints
and Family : Festival for 'Christmas. The
author'of the amendment' saysj
'.'The preservation of . - the * holidays
recognizes an urgent popular '; require
ment,^ but .since, the abolition, of the
concordat ends. the state's, recognition
of .\u25a0 religio.ur.V, festivals. I , substitute
springtime, '^'harvest, . memorial , arid

Ni.PLES, 'May 2?.â The eruption of
Mount .-Vesuvius continues, the .volcano
showing 1 {four .new opening.- through
which lava, flows, while the immediately
surrounding ; country Is covered with
ashes.- The funlculrr railroad' has been
compelled to cease running.
Neither Kerrigan, nor. Sullivan' could be
located yesterday. The former will- find
himself In an unpleasant situation if
Church .can prove his story. Conniving
et the : escape of a prisoner Is a felony,
and the- penalty is ten^ears imprisonment
in the penitentiary. _v ; - \
The police believe that Mrs. MltchelK
must have followed Church t6 Los An
geles. They have instructed the author-!
ities'of that city to ktep a watch for lifer.
She .was seen In thte city last Friday by
Detective Mulcaby. * . .
If Church sticks ta his story the woman
will be charged with i two . crimesâ being,
an accomplice -of- her husband and'aiding
in the escape of her paramour. Mrs.
Mitchell is a tall blonde and rather good
looking. ' N
The onlr reason wliy Captain "Burnett"
has some doubts as to the story of j the
.confession is the fact that Church had
only six months more to serve,
"It Stems impossible to me that a man
l'ke Church would want to have that
much money paid for his release." said
Burnett. "It seems to me that he would
want the woman to hold It until he got
his release."
When . asked if he had , received any
word from the Los Angeles police. Cap
tain Burnett said: "The first I heard ot
it was In The Call this morning. I can
do nothing until I get word from the
Sheriffs ctflce."
Besides being punished for his escape
Maurice Church will probably be tried for
embezzlement when he arrives. He toak
with him when he escaped a ring valued
at $350 from Qoung Quack Wah. a Chinese
murderer, and a watch from William H.
Dillard, a Federal prisoner. Both of these
articles he sold In Los Angeles, but they
were afterward recovered by the police.
Mrs. Mitchell at one time lived on Oc
tavja street. Later she moved to- 1363
Ellis street.. No information regarding
her could be obtained at either place by
the police.
When Kerrigan returned to the County
Jail Sheriff Curtis became suspicious. -He
ordered Chief Jailer Sullivan and Deputy
Sheriff Kerrigan suspended. After a pri
vate in\ f estig^tion by the Sheriff both
were dismissed.' : J -\ â¢
In her anxiety to *cc that his plan did
not miscarry Mrs. Mitchell herself gave
an inkling to the police that something
was wrong. Detective Taylor saw her
talking to Church outside the dentist's
office on the day that the escape was re
ported, \" '\u25a0:._' ''
SHERIFF DISMISSES DEPUTIES^
The v/oman evidently became Infatuated
*;th the ihitf and after her husband had
been taken to San Quentin to serve his
sentence she continued her visits to the
prison. She was permitted to have long
talks with Church.
\u25a0 Laier Church, was removed to the
Broadway County Jail. Mrs. Mitchell
went to visit him every day. It was durr
ing these visits that he plotted the es
cape, lie told her that he could buy his
freedom .and the police believe that the
womaji ' might have unearthed â¢ the
"plant" of $3SOO which her husband had
left In her keeping, for Church to bribe
liis way out of jail.
But the plans' were bungled. Church
.obtained . permission from Chief Jailer
J. E. Sullivan to visit a dentist's office.
M. J. Kerrigan, a deputy, was, ordered to
take him there- \u25a0' < .
Only $600 was recovered and the po
lice were conlident at the time that the
rubber's wife knew where the rest was
conceal* d. While Mitchell was In the
City Prison awaiting trial the woman
went frequently to see him. There she
met Church, who was acting as a "trus
ty."
The police are liking for Mrs. Anna
Mitchell, whose husband, John Purvis
Mitchell; was convicted of robbing the
Central Stock and Bond Exchange of
>iAo'\ Captain Burnett Is certain that
if ilaurice Church's story is true the
money that bought his release was put
up by Mrs. Mitchell and is part of the
SS4OC 'aken by her husband from the ex
change.
iÂ»olici: ii v vtixg fob won ax.
Churcn a>e:artd positively to the Los
Angeles police that money had been paid
?or lais release. He declared that when
be got back he "would take some one
else wiih him." When he arrived at the
County Jail, however, his attitude seemed
to change and he declined to answer any
question regarding his alleged confession.
Church was convicted on two charges
of larceny. lie was accused of commit
ting numerous thefte. Deputy' Sheriff
Ccyle is positive that Church Is lying and
that his confession is a fabrication. The
prisoner is not entitled to much credit for
veracity.
, '. 3J. J. Kerrigan was In charge of the
prisoner when he escaped. The police will
not maker any charge against bin at
present nor will the ghiriff, until
Church's story is thoroughly Investi
gated The returned escape refused last
night eitber to affirm or deny the story
of his confession which was printed ex
ciusivtly in The Call yesterday.
Chief Dinaa wLI leave ihe matter en
tirely to Sheriff Peter J. Curtis. The
Sheriff left town ear y yesterday morning
anci cruM not be located last night, but
it <s said that he will eift the matur to
the bottom. Chief Jailer Coyle had a
ta!k with Church last night, but the
prisoner refused to say anything further
repaying the arcusatlon he had made.
The money with which Church's release
is supposed to have been bought is i>art
of the $440 taken from the Central Stock
and Grain Exchange on September 23.

of this wa? re coves cd. Mitchell's wife

The Arctic struck the frail craft a
hard blow and smashed it to pieces. The
launch sank at once and Howfey went
down J with it. The Barbee brothers,
Sfcott and Miller jumped into the bay.
In the meantime Captain L. A. Nelson

It is possible that a running fight at
long range took place on Sunday, from
which: better results are expected, as
the naval authorities generally do" not"
believe 'that torpedoing * could be -" re
newed on Sunday night In the open
sea..
The majority of the naval authorities,
however, continue to believe that Rojest
vensky .. could * not risk a division of his
fighting ships. Those of . an optimistic
turn hope that Rojestvensky did actually
throw Togo off the trail and escaped him,
as the French fleet eluded Nelson on thu
way to' Egypt, and that they encountered
only torpedo-boats In the Straits of Ko
rea. This opinion, though, is not gener
ally shared, and the great majority think
that Togo's scouts were able to keep :n
touch with the fighting division and that
the Japanese lay In wait forsÃojest
vensky In the narrow waters where a bat
tle is reported to have taken place.
Nevertheless, practically nobody- be
lieves that Togo offered open battle, the
consensus of opinion being that the Jap
anese, favored by a stage- of the moon,
which was at three-quarters full, waited
â¢and delivered a series of torpedo attacks
Saturday night with such- aid 'as their
heavy ships could offer without running
too much risk. Mines may have, played
an important' role and, perhaps, been re
sponsible for a large share of the losses
report* 3. At any rate,*? the. result 'is. not
fully satisfactory tp .the naval 'authori
ties.' â¢ . '. ; '
COULD JfOT RISK A . DIVISION.
The newspaper dispatches naturally
created the wildest speculation. Some of
the. officers -of the admiralty' who on' Sa
turday were" inclined to take the view that
the ships off Wnsung were empty col
liers ssnt to the rear to avoid hampering
the warships, or that It was a division of
little fighting vafue dispatched to confuse
Togo and to throw him off the scent,
thought on Sunday that it was possible
Rojestvensky might after all have divid
ed his fleet and that the Japanese were
awaiting the arrival 'of the second Rus
sian division before making a generat an
nouncement. . i

The reports Bent to Washington by the
American Consul at Nagasaki of the sink
ing of five Russian worships/ including a
battleship and repair ship, was accepted
as the most definite and the moet au
thentic piece of news recefved'tip to mid
night, and undoubtedly produced a bad
Impression. The fear was expressed that
the battleship sunk might â¢ have been
Rojestvensky's flagship, the Kniaz Souva
roff. on which the -Japanese would un
doubtedly concentrate their fire. The
Finking of the repair ship Kamchatka,
which was filled with the most modern
machinery, i might. it was*; thought
prove later to be a more severe Joss than
that of a warship, but at the Admiralty,
wherethe crowds congregated on Sunday
afternoon and evening, hope â¢ was ex
pressed that If Rojestvensky. bad cleared
the gateway to the Sea of Japan with no
greater loss than that reported by the
American Consul, the passage had not
been uearly purchased, especially if later
reports should prove that the Japanese
losses were anything like equal propor
tionately. .'V.~: ; â¢

! St. PETERSBURG. May 23, 2:15 a. m.â
In. this momentous hour the Emperor,
the Admiralty, and the Russian public
are . waiting breathlessly for the Japanese
to supply authentic news of thÂ« fate of
Vice Admiral Rojestvensky and his fleet,
in which the hopes of; the Russians ape
centered. The official disposition Is to con
strue Tokio's silence \u25a0 favorably, but at
the same time the strategic reason ! for
6'lence Is recognized.
The public, after the premaiure demoh-
Etration of Saturday iiight, is inclined to
reverse its- attitude and to -"become pessi
mistic. â¢ - â¢'- â¢ ' ** '\u25a0 \u25a0 - -'' ;â¢'
The belief In naval circles in Washing
ton Is that the Japanese resorted to a
free usÂ« of their torpedo boats in their
attacks on' the ships of Admiral Rojest
vensky's fleet- The Japanese have a large
number of torpedo boats in their fleet,
and they demonstrated their effective
ness In -the operations around Port
Arthur.. Naval officials here to-night ex
press the opinion that it was unlikely
that such serious losses as those reported
had been inflicted by ordinary fire.
A dispatch iraa received at the State
Department to-day saying, that the Jap
anese Government had -made the an
nouncement that its fleet had engaged the
Russians in the Straits of Korea on Sat
urday and had held them.

'depends on the action' of the . ' vessel

ijo she carried was contraband, and on
other facts. If the vessel refused to
stop when the Russians "Ordered, the
latter, according: to the view hero, had
a right to sink her on the spot.' ..." -
Many American as well as vessels of
other nationalities are asserted . to be

this she was liable to seizure under the
law. as to prizes and to be disposed of
according to the rules of war.

RUSSIA TO KEEP O>' FIGHTING.
With Russia the loss of the naval
engagement is not so serious- a mat
ter, and while' such an outcome might
j tend to shorten the- war, there would
be nothing to. prevent the Russians
carrying on operations with j their
army Indefinitely, as it would not â¢ be
cut off from its base of supplies.. ,'._
There is no indication in the authen
tic advices that the entire -Russian
ileet has been destroyed, but. in the
event of such an occurrence naval
experts don't believe that Russia would
sue for peace. Count Cassini, the Rus
sian Embassador; and other high Rus
sian officials declared repeatedly '.'that
their Government would carry the war
to the bitter end. It Is the belief. here
that this will be done, as Russia/ has
intimated to the powers that v "she
would not brook. any. interference, and
that she proposed to conduct the .war
in her own way and carry on hostile
operations until she could dictate the
terms of peace.
On the other hand, Japan Is not'- so
anxious to continue, and offlcialCintl
mations have been given repeatedly
that she, would consent to peace. In
fact, Japan would welcome peace now,
especially as she could make liberal
terms, following a series of great vic
tories. .
There' has been little or no peace
talk here to-night, especially as the
belief is general that Russia would not
consent to accept peace in the face of
a long series of disastrous defeats, and ]
she would not "look with pleasure on
any suggestion coming from any
the first class powers. . .'â¢
For some time it has been known that
President Roosevelt would gladly act as
peacemaker if * the two hostile powers
should require, or even intimate, that his
good offices In this direction would be
acceptable. Of'course, he would not take
the Initiative, in view of the official dec
laration of Russia on- this subject.
NIGHT VISIT - TO- : WHITE HOUSE.
In view of the fact -that it is ; so well
known that Japan would welcome peace,
the hurried visit, of Takahira, the Japan
ese Minister, to the White House to-night
is rather significant. It is not the custom
of diplomats to call at the White House
on Sunday. except by especial permission
or on extremely :'\u25a0 pressing or important
business. \u25a0 ; .', â¢
There has been < much speculation as to
the purport of -this visit.-. Tb* Japanese
Minister walked to the White House, but
when he reached there he found 'that
.President Roosevelt had gone out for a
short drive. Takahira did not' wait ; f at
the President and : when he returned to
the legation he would not discuss the rea
son for his unusual visit to the Execu
tive Mansion. When naked if his errand
was for the purpose of discussing - the
question of peace and ;securlng- the : good
offices of President Roosevelt he dismiss
ed the subject in a diplomatic manner by
inquiring, for news'* of- the battle. The
Japanese Minister, { as -.well as the Rus
sian Embassador, are in the dark as to
what has occurred, as they have received
no official advices from â¢ their
governments. â¢ \u25a0\u25a0'= "â¢ \u25a0' \u25a0"- -."' -\u25a0 \u25a0'.-Â»
In the absence of details of the- battle,
army and navy officers 'decline to-night
to express their. views. They declared it
would be useless to enter Into a discussion
until they knew what had occurred..
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. May 28. â The greatest
. naval engagement of modern times was
that commenced on Saturday morning be
tween the powerful Russian fleet under
the command of Vice Admiral Rojest
vonsky and the Japanese fleet com
manded by Admiral Togo.
The first official Information of the battle
came from Minister Griscom at Tokio.
who cabled the Department of State
that the Japanese Government had offi
cially announced that Its fleet had en
â¢ gaged the Baltic squadron In the Straits
of Tsushima and that the Japanese had
held the straits. The American Min
ister gave no details of the battle and
nothing was contained in his cable
gram regarding the outcome, the losses
sustained by the contending lleets or
as to whether the battle was still In
progress.
Later In the day the American Con
eul at Nagasaki advised the Department
of State that it was rumored there that
an engagement had been fought, that
the Russian battleship Borodino and
four other Russian warships and one
repair ship had been sunk by the Jap
anese In the Straits of Korea. It was
said that the battle was still in prog
ress.
SIYKI.XG OF AMERICAN SHIP.
Still another cablegram was re
ceived by the department, but it related
to what may become a controversy be
tween Russia and the United States, as
the Baltic fleet fired upon an American
merchantman and sank it. No details
bt this occurrence were cabled, but Era
bassador Meyer In St. Petersburg has
been instructed to Institute an investi
gation.
The fact that the Japanese held the
ttraits against odds, when the strength of
ihe two fleets is compared, is an Indica
tion that the Mikado's \u25a0 Ironclads have
again inflicted another crushing blow
upon the Russian navy. "and has wiped
off the sea a large portion of the- last
\u25a0 remnants of the Czar's naval force, and
equalized the strength of the two fleets
which have been seeking the destruction
cf each other for some months.
If the advices from Nagasaki regard
ing the Russian losses are confirmed. Ad
miral Togo is now In n better position
than ever before to cope with his enemy.
Naval experts are somewhat surprised
at the tactics of Togo, for they believed,
' In view of the fact that his fleet was less
formidable than Rojestvensky's, that the
little Japanese would not make a standup
fight, but would choose his own time and
place and pick off the Russian warships
one by one until he had co reduced the
I Russian strength that the fleets would be
nearly equal. These experts believed
Togo would pursue this course because
there were two reasons why he should be
extremely cautious. One was that the
Russian fleet was much stronger than the
Japanese, and the other that the success
or failure of the war, so far as Japan Is
concerned, depended on the outcome of
the naval engagement. .
TOGO SURPIUSBS THE WOULD.
But the Japanese, by their masterful
tactics and daring, have surprised the
Western civilization a number of times
since the outbreak of hostilities and Togo
has again demonstrated that his people
are the peer of any in the world In the
arts of war. He decided to make a stand
up fight and to cripple the Russians at the
outset and not prolong the anxiety of his
government.
For months naval and army experts
have been speculating on the effects of
the outcome of the naval battle. Admiral
Dewey and other members of the naval
board and General Davis, General Weston
and other leading army, officers have de
clared ihat if the battle should result in
the annihilation of the ' Japanese fleet It
would mean that all the "costly victories
of Japan on land and sea would count for
nothing, as, with the Japanese navy, swept
from tl' -sea, Russia would then, be mis
tress mZ the situation. She . could prevent
reinforcements being sent Into Manchuria
and cut off the supplies of the Japanese in
that province and force ; them to live off
the country. " This the Japanese could hot
do ior any length cf time, even when their
frugality is taken into consideration, i for
the country is now devastated and a crow
could not live off It for a great length of
time. \u25a0 .'
With th% Japanese fleet disposed of,
the Russians could get supplies to the
front by way 'Of Vladivostok and 'use
tee trans-Siberian road exclusively
for the transportation of troops. Hun
dreds of thousands could be rushed to
the front and the Japanese in "Man
churia could .have, been overwhelmed
, .and 'driven Into the eea. In fact,' the i
life of Japan depended on winning- the
naval battle, ,as Its loss would not

Upon Roiestvensky.OAKLAND. May 23.â While In tha aims
of her mother, who was hurrying with
her child to a physician' 3 office, llttie
Mamie Geva, a year and a half old. died
this morning at 7 o'clock from poisoning,
the effect from eating matches yesterday
afternoon at her home, 1064 Twenty-sixth
avenue.
Tha baby was taken seriously 111 early
this morning. Not then realizing what
was the trouble, the parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Roland Geva, administered some
home remedies. These afforded the child
no relief. Shortly before 7 o'clock Mrs.
Geva wrapped the baby in blankets and
hastened off to Dr. A. H. Dodge's resi
dence, at 1182 East Fourteenth street.
Even then the mother did not . realize
that the little one was dying. She had
gone hardly half-way on her Journey
when the Infant gasped and choked, fall
ing lifeless In her mother's arms. Mrs.
Geva ran to the doctor's with her dead
baby. :'\u25a0:,'
The mother told Deputy Coroner Van
Vranken. who took charge of the case,
that yesterday afternoon- the Infant,
while crawling about the kitchen floor,
got some sulphur matches and chewed
them. The phosphorus on the heads of
the matches was taken into the baby's
system and slowly poisoned her. Coroner

| NEW YORK, May 28.â A communica
tion has been issued to the managers
and agents of the Equitable Life Assur
ance Society by President Alexander re
lating to the recent ruling of Justice
Maddox in the suit of Franklin B. Lord
against the society, and embodying an
! opinion of counsel representing the so
ciety as to the scope and effect of the
court's action in restraining the carry
ing into effect of the amended charter
adopted April 6, pending a final deter
mination of the action on its merits. The
communication says:
It the opinion or Mr. Justice lladdox stands
as a correct interpretation of the legal status
of this eoclety, a single stockholder has the
legal right to defy the wishes of all the re
maining shares and of the board of directors
and of the policy holders and to prevent any
concession whatsoever to the claims of policy
holders to a chare In the management of tne
assets of this society.
The amended charter now before the super
intendent of insurance for his approval em
bodies the unanimous results of the views of
the members of the board and ' confers upon
the policy holders the right to elect a majority
of the board. It would, in - our ' opinion, be
most injurious to the interests of the society
and to its future welfare and its permanent
prosperity if the amended charter should not
be carried into effect by reason of the injunc
tion granted by Justice Maddox, and we are
firmly ot the opinion that the > appelate courts
will decline to approve, of 'the views expresad
by Mr. Justice Maddox as to the validity of
the proceedings of; this board in adopting the
amended charter. . ;

ALAMEDA, May 28.â While automobil
ing this afternoon in Alameda with his
family and some friends, George N.
Phelps, residing at 1532 Walnut street,
Berkeley, ran the machine into a trolley
wire pole on Wetister street, near Santa
Clara avenue. The impact of the collision
was bo great that the six occupants of
the vehicle were thrown out Fortunately
none of them was seriously Injured. One
woman, whose name Phelps refused to
give, was cut about the head and required
a physician's attendance.
The accident occurred at 5 o'clock.
Phelps' attention had been distracted
from the pilot wheel for a moment as he
watched members of the party pass a dog
from the rear to the front seat of the
automobile. He lost control of the. vehicle
and it swerved suddenly toward the gut
ter and smashed against the. iron pole at
the edge of the sidewalk. Out went Phelps
into the street, followed by his wife, two
children and the man and woman, whose
identity Phelps concealed.

BERKELEY. May 2S.â A series of
Graeco-Roman games is being planned
by Professor Walter E. Magee of the
University of California, to be held in
the Greek Theater on the campus during
the coming year at the university. De
tails of the project are now being ar
ranged by the professor, who is at the
head of the department of physical cul
ture.
No other institution in the country has
the facilities of the University of Cali
fornia for such an exhibition, the Greek
Theater lending itself admirably to the
purpose. All the associations connected
with the famous contests of, the Greeks
of ol<s, described by writers of history,
may be reproduced with minute fidelity
to detail in the Greek Theater at the
university, and if all goes well the same
sort of spectacles that used to attract
the Athenians- by thousands to the
pamcp will be put on in this modern day
in a California university, under the di
rection of a modern physical culture ex
pertâProfessor Walter Magee.
It is planned to have wrestling, broad
sword combats*, eingle-stick encounters,
fencing and posing by the most perfectly

classes. l â¢ I

President of the San Francisco Associa

addressed the assemblage on the neces
sity of membership to the society and
made a epecial appeal to the richer Jews
in the city to contribute to the * small
monthly fund raised to defray the great
expense. He urged the people to think
on the question whether it is possible
for the Jews ever to have a particular
state they can call their own, and show
ed them the advantages such a land
would be.
"The leaders In this. Zionist movement
hope to solve the problem of residence
for the persecuted of our people who have
to tolerate the restraint forced on them,"
he said.
Miss Anna Spivok read a paper on the
condition confronting the Helpers of Zion
and the history and methods so far tried*
to accomplish their lofty purpose. Sh*}
told. of the massacres by the European
fanatics and the restraint underÂ«vhich the
Jews labor in the East, making the lib
erties of those .coming to- the United
States seem incredible.- A picture-pf the
great work that has been undertaken by.
the English and American Jews was
drawn by h/r, arousing " the profound
sympathy of the audience.

i- : Nearly- seven years' experience in public life
has impressed upon me the desirability of corn
ing in frequent . contact * with the people; and
occasions such as this afford the opportunity.
By association we learn that, after all. >, we are
working- with ithe same objects ! in view, j al-
I though \ honest * differences > may . exist \u25a0 as to
| methods. -In 'these days -of enlightenment bo
j public; official, if insincere, can deceive the
1 people lons', but if he manifests a disposition
|\u25a0 to be straightforward, I keeping 'in touch i with
'hie constituency, even though perhaps ' lacking
in ability, there is a disposition to lend him
encouragement. Honesty jn public life is Just
a* essential, as .honesty in ; business life. ; -.-
California, and in fact the whole Pacific
Coast.ris numerically : weak in the House of
Representatives. - From the coast, including
California. Oregon, Washington, Nevada; Idaho
and- Montana, , we have but sixteen Congress
. tnen. ;; New York alone has thirty-seven. -Penn-'
sylvania thirty-two, Illinois thirty-five and
Ohio twenty-one. I call this to your particular
'attention that you may understand the-dif
ficulties your congressional delegation will en
counter in ' its efforts to â¢ obtain legislation to
prevent the unrestricted Immigration of Japa
nese, ' Thia Is a vital question to the working
men of California, because they are the direct
1 sufferers -from â¢ the competition of Japanese
clieap labor. But we must bear in mind that
California. has but eight representatives In the
House, a small fraction of three hundred and
elghty-slx. Many of the members are from
States where a Japanese is seldom seen. In
no State in the Union, outside of California,
and perhaps Oregon and Washington, does the
Japanese question yet present a serious aspect,
but this condition does not lessen, in the slight
est degree, the seriousness of the evil in Cali
fornia and the other coast States. The South,
according to reports from Washington, is com
plaining of a' shortage of labor, and this condi
tion will make it more difficult to obtain con
gressional action.' It will only be a question of
time, however, unless immediate action is
taken, that the worklngmen of other States
will find the problem . brought to their doors.
To my, mind the Immigration arriving on the.
Atlantic Coast is almost as serious a menace
to the American worklngman as the influx of
Japanese on this coast. We are told that the
present year will break all records. Thousands
are landing daily. \u25a0 - This is one of : the most
serious 'problems \u25a0 with ; which Congress must :
deal. I am in | favor, of the enactment of the ;
most stringent immigration laws. -This ques
tion must receive immediate attention.

livered "one of the series of lectures that
has been : arranged by ) Carpenters' .Union
No. 36. .Ministers, politicians, statesmen
and business : men have been , invited .to
deliver addresses; upon labor topics, and
Mr. . Knowland to-night \ told - about the

the recent commencement " week, ;i for
this r purpose, and 'the sentiment 'of the
class t apparently ;. favors'" such' action.
Members will. pass"*iip6n :it und; the of

' President Hallett has; just completed
the task of preparing a, report of the
class expenses and its . receipts during
commencement week. < .The class \ broke
all records 'in the matter of profitable
projects; which it fostered during that
week;* and also for. expense, incurred' in
making ," notable the various class, af
fairsâ thef class ball, picnic, extrava
ganza, programme and other features.
; "There .was criticism of the class; for
the failure of some of its members to
graduate,", said; Hallett to-day, "but
there has been none, I. believe, regard
ing the character ,of its class affairs
during commencement week, and we
are highly gratified at the "result as
shown by the financial statement. The
total expenses incurred are divided as
follows: Programme, $401 50; senior
ball, $209 90; picnic, $8160; morning
committee, $140; extravaganza, $935 28;
general expenses, $215. Total, $1983 28.
The total receipts were $2664 95, leav
ing a net profit of $681 67. Of this
amount about $150 will be set aside for
permanent class expenses, and I think:
$500 \u25a0\u25a0 may be used to' advantage in
establishing a student postofflce. This
would require the use of a number for
each student,; in the student catalogue
and a corresponding, number on. his bojc
in the- postofflce. ; The postofHce would
be in the'basement of the new Califbr
nia'Hall, where the co-operative store
is to be moved. It is desirable to have
such a postofflce at the students' head
quarters." > :
BERKELEY, May 28i ; i-The establish-,
ment of a students' postoffice ;on \u25a0. the
university; campus,"" similar /to' those in
operation l in many. Eastern universities,
is proposed;by -Eugene R- Hallett, who
has | just ' been electe'dv*permanent class
president of the class of 1905, Univer
sity of Californiaf. Hallett' s .idea will
be submitted to the college authorities,
and if their consent is obtained the i in
novation will be made. \u25a0\u25a0'
Building operations' keep pace with the
movement of real estate, and there -la a con
tinuous demand for small houses \u25a0 and cottages
Cor sale on easy terms. There is also a steady
demand for extra choice properties where ex
tensive improvements may be made. In short,
purchasers may readily be found for good in
vestments of any kind.
The Alameda Advancement Associa
tion is receiving many favorable replies
to the circular recently sent out asking
the^citizens of the city to aid in the
establishment of a permanent ; bureau
for the advertisement and betterment of
Alameda, where a regular officer might
be installed to take charge of this
work.
The Berkeley real estate situation is satis
factory. . Of the new tracts recently placed on
the market none show a better report than the
Humphreys, the Northlands and the McGee
tracts. I There Is also considerable movement
along the line of the Key Route's new rxten
-sion in th? Claremont district. In this district
one entire tract changed hands within a single
week. -
In discussing -the Berkeley, real es
tate market' Francis Ferrler, cne newly
elected president of the California State
Realty Federation, said to-day: .
The E. P. Vandercook Company of
this city has also recently issued an
illustrated pamphlet . entitled "A Few
Pointers About" Oakland." The booklet
does not, as its "name would indicate, re
late entirely, to the city of Oakland,
but also calls the attention of the
reader to the beauties of Alameda and
Berkeley. It contains a number of fine
engravings, â¢ among which, are views
of 1 the Oakland water front j and the
State University."; ; f .â¢. , ; ' '.
OAKLAND. May 28.â Definite plans
are now well, under way for. the erec
tion of a first-class tourist' hotel In
this city, and it is expected that the
work of constructing the new building,
which is to be located on the old Mer
rill property at the corner of Telegraph
avenue and Twenty-flfth street, will be
commenced in a short time. ;.
The new hotel is! to be erected by
John Conant. a well-known architect
and real estate broker of Oakland, who
is the owner of the property, and when
completed will be leased by him to
H. S. Krlgbaum. The plans for. the
new hotel as now prepared call for .a
thoroughly modern fire-proof structure
containing IQO rooms, which will be
erected to face Telegraph avenue.
The rapid "development of the busi
ness center in the last two years has
caused the progressive citizens of Oak
land to 1 express approval of the plans
for a City Hall. The members of the
Oakland Board of Trade have entered
into, the campaign for a new municipal
building.
Alameda County real estate men are
highly- gratified at the honor accorded
to this county in the selection of offi
cers of the California State Realty Fed
eration, which has just closed its an
nual convention at Los Angeles. Four
prominent real estate brokers of Ala
nieda County were elected oflicers of
the federation. Francis Ferrler of
Berkeley being elected president, F. W,
Crandall, the Oakland manager of the
Realty Syndicate, treasurer, and John
T. Bell of this city and H. D. Irwin of
Berkeley members of the board of di
rectors. .
"Beautiful Fruitvale" is the title of a
new, handsomely illustrated booklet
just issued by the Board of Trade of
Fruitvale, which will be used for the
advertisement of the pretty eastern
suburb. The pamphlet i 3 illustrated
with colored photo-engravings and con
tains a wealth of information valuable
to homeseekers and prospective in
vestors.

[When you feel languid, tire<f|
nervous and irritable, your vi-
tality is lowâ your 'supply ,bl
nerve energy exhausted,- and
your system running' down foe
lack of power,"
iThe organs of the body are
working poorly 4 or not at all,
and you are not ' getting the
nourishment needed. This sbba
impoverishes the blood and in-
stead of. : throwing off the im-
purities,^ distributes it all
through the ,body. This brings
disease and misery.
Feed the nerves with' Dr.
Miles', Nervine, a nerve food, a
nerve medicine, that nourishes
and strengthens the nerves, and
see how. quickly you will get*
strong and vigorous.
"My wife suffered with nervoujmess
previous to a recent attack of typhoid
fever, but after her recovery from thÂ»
reyer, she was much worse, and could
hardly control herself being exceed-
ingly nervous when the least excited.
She was very restless at night, and
â¢ ?i e JfL;Â«?i^ Kood night's. rest. She
also suffered much from nervous head-
\u25a0Â£?*-/**: MUes Nervine was recom-

"three doses she had a good night's

The Adams-Gardner match furnished
the best tennis of the day. Adams ha^
been practicing constantly of late and
his game has improved wonderfully.

would probably have beaten Gardner.

The fifth annual tennis tournament
for the championship of San Fran
cisco , was commenced yesterday on
the California Club courts. ' Of the
twenty-four players entered only four
were left in the competition when tlma
was called late in the afternoon. The
players who will meet in the semi
finals to-morrow are Herbert Schmidt,
Harry Rolf e, Charles Foley and Carl
Gardner. * The first two and the last
two will be opposed \u25a0to -each other.
Foley ia the only player of the four
from the park. â¢ ; â¢ ; . , . ,
The tournament was . by . no -means
as successful as those, held in .the past.
The 'entry list was smaller and the
number of defaults recorded was com
paratively large. ; Tme only redeeming
feature was the fact that in. only one
instance was the defaulting player of
much prominence.. This was .Qcorge
Baker, the park champion, who. had an
excellent chance to win. the tourna
ment. He was present, but a toothache
Saturday night kept him out of the
game yesterday. .
The defeat of Herbert Lonsr at tha '
hands of Harry Rolfe in ; a one-sided
match occasioned some surprise, but it
was not unexpected.* liongr played his
usual tournament game, and Rolf a
beat him about as he pleased. The
winner was as steady as ever, while
"Long seemed to have forgotten how !
to play entirely.
Of the four successful players the
work of Schmidt was probably the
best. He beat Harold Gabriel and Dr.
Bush easily. Schmidt was much
steadier than usual and played a game
that should come close to landing him
on top.
Rolfe also covered himself with \u25a0
glory, beatins? Gayness, Nourse and
Long in straight sets*. Foley had two .
easy matches and did not have to ex- '
tend himself. The play of Gardner;
was rather a disappointment True,
he beat Adams in straight sets, but
the latter did not play his beat game.
Gardner will play with more confi
dence from now on, and the enuiusi
asts look for a great improvement in
his same.
Gold Rose has a world of early speed,
but she will probably find the distance
rather too far for her. Kiamesha is sure
to go well, and as she has shown what
she can do with weight up she must be
given a chance. The day's entries:

or two races at Gravesend to-morrow
and It will be well to lookout for th&m.
In the Manhassett stake George C. Ben
nett, a clinker from all accounts, will
be seen for the first here, and the Ben
nington entry will have to look to its
laurels in upholding the honor of the
East. The card looks promising 1 for
some excellent sport and every event
has sufficiency of entries. .
The opening event | looks like a hot
fight between I>ady Amelia and Ham
burg Belle. Both mares are speedy be
yond a question.' If it comes down to a
matter of endurance Hamburg Belle
looks the best, but she may not have
quite as much early speed. In spite of
her phenomenal speedy I^ady Amelia
could not get 'away, from her field the
last time out and therefore she may not
be quite at her best yet. Outcome and
Memories will carry the, Clay colors and
both mares have distinguished them
selves In many a hard-fought. battle on
metropolitan tracks. Irene Lindsay ia
as good as she ever was. Trainer Sam
Hildreth will do all he can to succeed
with her, as she ia the first thorough
bred he saddles in the East for some
time.
Uncles tribe was there with a come
back of two in the next spasm. Irwin
g<>i a four-spot and Nealon ripped one

THE PRESS OF THE NATION.
â¢:â¢ MSBIONmMIRgÂ§R
THE lightning flashes that momentarily illuminate the social
situation in Russia are not sufficiently prolonged to show us
what is actually occurring in that empire of unrest. We read
of fierce conflicts between Hebrews and Hebrews, between Hebrews
and Christians, and between all classes and the state. Riots, assas
sinations and martial law are in fact the order of the day in Holy
Russia and he would indeed be a hardy prophet who would ven
ture to predict the end of it all. .
The war with Japan is of course the source of the seething
discontent, of which the real history is still a long way from being
.written, but it is a discontent that cannot be cured by armed Cos
-sacks, nor by any of those other . methods that seem to constitute
the sole resources of the Government. Russian sentiment has be
come inflamed by repression, the safety valves of the social system
have been screwed down tightly, and it is only the precise date of
the explosion that has been at all uncertain. It is strange that events
that have been recognized by the whole world as inevitable should
occasion any surprise anywhere, even in Russia. In the meantime
the outworn, discredited and hateful methods of repression are being
once more applied. Russia is being again treated with the hair of
the dog- that has bitten her and the flames of revolt are being momen
tarily covered with highly inflammable material.
It would seem as though every nation must pass through its
cycle of revolution before it can reach the road of real progress.
It must cither sternly assert itself or it must retrograde. France
passed triumphantly through her ordeal by fire a century ago. That
Russia has delayed it so long is a disquieting indication of the ex
plosive forces that must have accumulated and that only the wisest
statecraft can control. ;. â¢
In the meantime the issues of the impending naval conflict hang
tremulously, in the balance. "The result of that conflict' may- Have
a decisive influence upon the war itself. Its '\u25a0â¢ influence upon the do
mestic war of which we get such lurid'glimpsjes from day to day
may be even more decisive. ;

pEMININB , coquetry In France . is. as some one has said, the ' science of
pcharm. It' Is not ; purely Impulse, Intermittent, unreliable; It Is a calculable
".Quantity. Described In general terms,. It Is the art of pleasing; denned
specifically, it is the art of pleasing man. .ââ , r \u0084 >
. , In France, \u25a0 however, coquetry ;Is a matter i far more 'serious than ; it is in
our country. To,us the.word Implies a certain 1 lightness of manner, , which Is
attractive or; otherwise,; according-, to?- ' r
the personal .charms ,of 'the : coquet. â¢\u25a0
It is . a subtle- Invitation to admiration,
or. even y to ; But : :to ; ;the
French woman coquetry lis much more
inclusive. Deportment Is only/one phase
of .a" many-sided : art. Clothes, "speech;
habit of mind, are elements quite as Im
portant. . .=\u25a0 r.v- ' -; - \u25a0 -. '..\u25a0" -â \ \u25a0',\u25a0\u25a0-'.\u25a0 . .
â¢ Therefore, I when Max . O'Rell remarked
a few years "ago that by; judicious co
quetry a woman's could keep; beautiful
and young till^ 60 years of age, he re
ferred to graces of mind and heart,' as
well as /superficial - charms. â¢, He made
the cultivation -of amiability a factor
as well as diet and care in
regard to the toilet.
To be beautiful, to be, charming, to
be loved and- to 5 love is the French
woman's /aspiration. She recognizes
thiÃ as '- her .feminine mission. And her j
. coquetry 'â¢ isX but - a natural expression
of - this ambition of hers. Though; her
interests are domestic, artistic, musical
or literary, i.still she does not lose her
amiable -desire to/please.
i According, to the French Idea; a ; ma
ture woman,, in order to be really beau
tiful, must; love.; or must have lovedâ lt
Is love whlch'.completes her beauty-â it
is love which _perfects her charm:>:;lf
she has never knewn-love she has never
known life.,; To^be a woman of -the
world one must have lovedâ arid: to be
truly Parisian. one must be a woman of
the world. < . \u25a0 v
Love is, however, say the French, : a
passion which belongs to maturity. .To
them- would', be incomprehensible that
American type, which one of our.; psy
chologists recently exploited, the girl
of 16,, of good 'Social standing,, who car-.)
rles on three loveaffalrs at once, corre-- ;,.
Bpondlng with sweetheart No. 1 In sentimental terms, walking to and from
school with- No. v 2. blushing -whenever he ; looks at her. and. as soon as the
coast is clear, taking a walk with N0."3.* Nor can ithey "understand upon "short
acquaintance a ciylHzation^which countenances such frivolity.
The young French girl's very inexperience with men makes her more,
eager to. please the nance who has been selected for her by her family and
friends. Her 'coquetry, develops naturally, therefore, and in 1 the most whole
some 'â¢ way. ?;. " /.. ; . .- \u25a0 â¢ "'-\u25a0'\u25a0" : s .'
\u25a0 Her refinement of manner, speech, dress, is an expression of her wish to ;
give pleasure to him whom she is to marry, and whom with perfect simplicity^
she accepts as one whom she shall love and obey. There Is no prose in her
dream of marriage; 'tis, all pure poetry. . \
Coquetry Is. therefore, among French women a domestic as well as, a
social virtue. 'T's the means by which she wins love and the method by,
which~"sherctairis-tho love she has won. - Through; it she is queen of her
home and keeps throughout her whole life her place .of dignity and power
MARKET conditions last week were practically repetitions of
the preceding three or four weeks. The country seems to be
gradually settling down to the summer lull, when business
declines to its low ebb over the heated term, a period of some three
months. The season, however, is several weeks backward all over
the country. Cool weather and excessive rains in some large sec
tions are producing their natural effect by retarding the demand for
summer fabrics and rendering crop yields less positive, . but the
general situation continues promising. .
The clearing-house returns from all points continue to showman
increase in general trade over last year, the gain last week being
46.9 per cent, with only fifteen out of the ninety cities reporting
their clearings exhibiting a loss, and, with the exception of Mil
waukee, which shows the insignificant decrease of 2 per cent, the
losses are confined to the third and fourth rate cities and towns.
Every one of the large cities has a pronounced gain, such as 63.4 per
cent at New. York, 38 at Philadelphia, 33.7 at Pittsburg, 50 at Cin
cinnati, 23.1 at Chicago in spite of the great strike there, and so* on.
The aggregate clearings themselves were $2,674,000,000, which is
over the normal. In other words, the expansion in general trade
is ahead of the expansion in population.
Our foreign trade is exceedingly heavy, having again touched
highwater mark. April merchandise exports reached $129,000,000,
or $20,000,000 more than last year. Imports in the same month
were $95,500,000, or $12,000,000 greater than last year. The
excess of exports was $33,750,000 in April.
Of the staples but little can be said. The production of iron
and steel is still running high, the output of pigiron in March and
April being at the rate of 24,000,000 tons per year, the heaviest out
put of any previous year being 18,700,000 tons, in 1903. The tan
ners everywhere report a remarkably urgent demand for leather,
and in this market, at least, hides have lately made several advances
in consequence. The demand for" wool has been so sharp that the
California clip has already practically passed into consumption^ the
quantity left on hand being but a petty percentage of the spring
clip, while prices are very high. Stocks of grain have become so de
pleted that here in California there is* a scramble for barley, the sup
ply of which is away below the demand, resulting "iri a violent rise
in prices, while spot wheat is in light supply. The oats, like the
wool, are practically all gone. The dairy industry is returning
large profits to the dairying interest, and has been doing so for half
a dozen years.
The market for dried fruits has not been so closely cleaned up
for years, and even the prune, which has been" selling at and below
cost of production for several seasons, has advanced at least 50 per
cent in price during the past month, with stocks in the great con
suming markets of New York and London far lighter than for years,
while the crop on this coast is so light as to almost insure much
higher quotations this year. Hops are another' product high in
price and returning splendid profits to the producer. Stocks of
canned fruits are also much broken, and some lines are cleaned out
altogether. Feedstuffs of all descriptions are away above the nor
mal and very firm at the fancy quotations. The textile and foot
wear factories of the East are reporting the mills actively employed,
with the amount of idle machinery insignificant. Groceries and
provisions are in good steady demand, while the cotton, market,
which was so depressed some months ago, has of late' been steadily
* advancing.
# : Turning from this most excellent exhibit of the staples to the
financial market, we find similar encouraging conditions. Money is
easy and surprisingly plentiful everywhere, with rates of interest
low and not materially affected by the vagaries of an unsettled and
creneraily weak national stock market. In Europe, too, the supply
of money, in spite of the recent enormous Russian and Japanese
loans, is so large as to be unwieldy, while the stock of gold at Paris
has risen to the extraordinary figure of $570,000,000.
The above briefly outlines the current business situation. With
the staples meeting with a large consumptive demand, which ab
sorbs the. products of the farm and factory as rapidly as they touch
the market, and a superabundant supply, of cash all over the world,
conditions could hardly be better. ]'' 7^t-

MAKING A SUCCESS
Put an End to Condemnation and Get on Good

ANGELA MORGAN
1 >"\u25a0 AVEyou acquired the "just my lv ck" habit? Do you. when circumstances

"If this has been your custom. It is no wonder you find /It so difficult to
"make a success of your undertakings, indeed, it would be a^marvel if you did
not fall for you have been steadily condemning yourself to failure.
Out of your own mouth this condemnation has come. Fate has, had nothing

to do wltn it. .. lonr.worus u|u> .*â¢*Â«..
where you are and you will never suc

and frees you \ from undesirable condi
tions.*: Condemnation:; paralyzes your
faculties, "makes circumstances frown
and keeps you forever bound to unde
sirable conditions. - \u25a0':-'\u25a0
Therefore, learn to praise. If you
have been' in the habit of belittling your
talents, if you have doubted your capa
city \u25a0\u25a0- for success, " if you have declared
yourself poorly; qualified to meet the
problems confronting you, right about
face and take the opposite course.
Declare that you are fully, able to
achieve the things you desire; that you
have the gifts and qualities needed for
your work; that you are open to Inspi
ration \u25a0â¢ and power ! and that you expect
success to come your way. '-,
'Praise your efforts â not to others, but
to yourself. Praise your possibilities
and praise the environment which fur
nishes you the materials out of which
you are to create success. ;
Whatever you declare about yourself
becomes a reality. When you say that
your abilities are mediocre, that your
efforts are unavailing or that .your life
is of little use ; to the -world, you create
a /condition which corresponds to your
statements.
By your own statements you literally
make of yourself a mediocre person and
limit your usefulness to* the world:
When "you insist upon it that nothing
good can come to you, fate takes you at
your \u25a0 word and 1 provides for - you .Just
the soi;t. of conditions you have decreed.
You can never be on good terms with
"luck" while you persist in prescribing
bad fortune for yourself. "Luck" re
fuses to smile upon such disloyalty. The
only way to win the approbation of thati
deity is to refuse to recognize failure. Â»_. , Tirii;^"-;unÂ»z;i*^yÂ«
'Break ott the habit of condemnation by acquiring a new habitâ the hÂ»Wt of
praise Believe in good fortune as your right. Start a new current by declar
ing, whenever anything particularly good happens. "This is Just my luckr
That is the way to get "luck",on your side. Of course there Isn't any such
deity "Luck" is nothing more nor less than your own thoughts ot success
pictured in your surroundings. It Is Just decreeing what you want and by
your faith in its reality bringing it to pass. -
Don't condemn yourself or your talents, or your future any longer. When
you condemn yourself you condemn your creator. When you speak slightingly
of your gifts or your Intelligence you question the universal Intelligence in
which you live and move and have your being. That reservoir of power la
always open to you.-
TURNERS IN THE CIVIL WAR
teered In such numbers that in New York
a turner regiment was enlisted and sent
to the front under Colonel Max Webber.
The Ninth Ohio was another regiment
of turners, from Cincinnati, and In Phil
adelphia and St. Louis turners filled the
ranks of regiments which did not have
the distinctive name. General Slgel com
manded several thousand turners in his
force and was their idol, for. he had been
a leader of the turner bund* in vis own
land and was one of the fighting revolu
tionary commanders who led his army
into Switzerland and there disbanded It
after the cause was lost.

body for the hardships of the field and
camp. This ideal of classic times/, wisely
reincarnated in modern Germany to serve
a nation's needs, was transplanted to the
United States by the fortune of war. The
turner societies aroused some antag
onism, based on the specious claim that
they -. were an attempt ito create a \u25a0 state
within a : state and to keep~ the Germans
apart .from the -llfe^ around,, them. This
contention was magnificently shattered a

Besides these ladies a number of con

If is unnecessary to 'tell you we are headquarters for Furs.
Why? v Because almost every woman in San Francisco knows that
all good kinds of Fur Garments can be bought to best advantage
hereâ that our Furs are as superior for style and elegance as they
are for comfort and service. Our large factory is equipped with the
most 1 modern fur-making machinery, and no piece of fur work is too
* large for our capacity, nor too small for. our careful and thoughtfur
consideration. / .^

WASHINGTON, May 28.â How a single
deserter from the United States navy
caused an active correspondence between
an American Embassy and the State De
partment and led a Mexican newspaper
to publish an erroneous statement that
seventy-nine j had deserted an
American warship, is disclosed in the case
of a member of the crew of the cruise*
Columbia, who deserted that ship at Vera
Cruz, Mex. / '",, *' .
The : - statement was I published . f Qllowing
the'visit of the Columbia to the Mexican
port, whither she conveyed the remains
of tho late Embassador, Senor Azpiroz.
\u25ba The official statement at > the Navy De
; partment is that but nine men out of the
entire crew, of eeveral hundred, were ab-.
sent without leave .when the Columbia
left Vera Cruz j for- the United States.
Three ' of those, it is said, rejoined the
navy at New wf leans. . ' .
Attention is called to , the , fact that the
deserter, who gave .out . the information
reflecting upon the service and who styled
himself a first-class fireman, had seen but
twenty-one days' service In the United
States navy, which : he : entered as a coal
passer, his service at sea amounting only
to the 'trip from; therUhlted States,. to
Vera Cruz; \u0084'â¢"- . ' ' Â«". \u25a0 . ? 'â¢ 'â¢ .*â¢'â¢-' ..

case, and say those who leave ships are

Special : Dispatch . to The CalL
WASHINGTON, May 1 28.â -For the
purpose of enlisting the sympathy^ of
President Roosevelt in a larger, export
market for American meats. President
F. J. Hagehbarth of Denver of the Na
tional Livestock called at
the White House. So great was the
President's interest, that he has prom-,
ised to deal with the subject in his next
annual message to Congress, U and \will
take up a number of other matters of
vital importance to livestock â¢ men. ; ,
"Nothing can compensate for the loss
of a market, except to. get that market
back," said Hagenbarth to the! Presi
dent. "We have lost millions of dollars
annually for the ; last three or four
years tin export markets for meat 3
alone* through commercial misunder
standings that have resulted in* tariff
retaliation against meat from this
country; Germany's discrimination has
been the ' most severe, although the loss
of the French market has cost livestock
interests 540,000,000; annually.". -
The President encouraged Hagen
\ barth ,to continue his explanation and
then asked him what he proposed;as
a solution. â¢. \u25a0'; - '
"Reciprocity, ; probably, â¢ and If we
can't "get I that," .:*\u25a0 retaliation," '.replied
Hagenbarth. ' '
The President agreed as to- the rem
edy,' although t: he thought; that re
ciprocity and. retaliation. could both be
adopted by , the United ' Statesâ -a re
ciprocal arrangement with countries
that were disposed to 'be friendly com
mercially and retaliatory- measures
for countries that were inclined to treat
the United States with unfairness. He
agreed with Hagenbarth that the Sub
ject should go before Congress and' the
people and asked the president of the
livestock association to present. a. brief
that would inform him of the associa
tion's position. Hagenbarth ; promised
to put the brief in the President's hands
by July 1. *. "" 'â¢ â¢
