said Laura, standing aside for him. to
enter, but Immediately resuming her
place at the window. "I want to block
the view of that man in the cloak when
he reaches this carriage. Ah, we're
moving; he won't do it; 1 He has tailed
; off and is going back to the barrier."
And pulling up the window, she added
in French as she seated herself: "It is
'"all. safe now, madame; the. mouchard
hag beaten" a safe retreat."*'
; Then for the first time Fortescue per

1 look In that direction before, but now
he sawVthat at the 'far end, half con
cealed by. Lady > Metcalf's ample form
arid ' by, ai barricade of rugs and travel
ing -bags, a lady was sitting. As she
was. on the same side with himself, it
was not till she leaned forward to re
ply that he got a full view of her face,
and it required all his self-control to
stifle an exclamation. .

may as well think that she is succeed
ing," that rising diplomatist told him
self, as he began to : Join in the general
conversation that upon the ty
rannies of* the Russian .police system.
Too well schooled to be astonished for
long at this chance meeting, he was
thinking hard how best to take advan
tage of it, and he was glad indeed
that lima Vasslli had not confided the
name of her rival to Laura. Small
scope. would there be for subtlety if
his Impetuous . fiancee knew that the
daihtyjfigxire. in ;the costly furs was the
cause of Dubrowski's undoing.
-Naturally the talk ran for a while
on the Tsar's tour, more especially on
what the* English travelers had seen
of It at Breslau', and Fortescue was a
little afraid at Â¦ first, of some indiscre
tion on Laura's part. And, though she
abstainedâ with what by an occasional
solemn wink at him she evidently
thought was a most praiseworthy cau
tionâfrom trenching on dangerous
ground, he changed the subject as soon
cupied, and Boris defiant; but thÂ«r
were not in the same carriage.
An hour-later Fortescue and the Met
calfs were themselves en route, and,
travelling via Berlin, reached Paris at
noon next day. There, as previously
arranged, they took rooms at the Grand
for the night, Lady Metcalf enjoying a
well-earned rest at the hotel, while the
two young . people crammed as much
Paris as was possible into their after
noon and evening.
Wednesday morning broke wet and
stormy, and Lady Metcalf, who was a
"bad sailor," was more, than half, in
clined to remain in Paris another 'day.
Fortescue, however, knowing that In
spector Melton would meet the train at
Boulogne, persuaded her to start, under
the proviso that if the weather did not
moderate they could put up at-Bou
logne till the morrow.
They /ere early at the Rue de Dun
kerque, and Lady. Metcalf, with a
Scotswoman's antipathy to- extra pay
ments, disdaining a coupe, Fortescue
secured seats in a vacant first-class
carriage. Having done his best to pre
serve,their privacy by giving the guard
a liberal pour-bolre, he lert, the 1 ladies
while he went to exchange . greetings
with a Foreign Office colleague whom
he had seen in a carriage farther up
the train. Here he stood chatting till
the starting bell., warned him .that it
was time to hurry back to his own seat.
On approaching the compartment he
was surprised to see, Laura with her
head and shoulders out of the window,
not looking in his direction, but toward
the barrier, where a shabby little man
in a frayed cloak was parleying 1 with a
railway official. Just as Fortefcue
reached the compartment the little man
was permitted to pass on to the plat
form, and, running to the train, began
to peer into the carriages.
may ask of you a small favor, roon-
Bieur," she said. "Here I have written
a telegram which I desire to dispatch
to a business correspondent at Copen
hagen. Would you be so good as to
send It off for me from the office at
Amiens station? That wretched mou
chard at Paris has made me nervous
about showing myself on the platform.
He might have boarded the train at the
last moment."
Fortescue assented with the utmost
politeness, and she handed him the pa
per, with a sufficient sum to pay the
charges. As soon as the train stopped
he alighted, but she called him back.
"You know Russian, monsieur?" she
said. "Ah, then I should explain," she
proceeded in reply to his negative. "I
have written the address in French,
but, in case they ask you, the body. of
the telegram is in Russian. That is all,
monsieurâ au revoir, quickly."
Not till he was In the office and out of
sight of the train did he show any In
terest in the draft of the telegram, but
then his first 'glance at It evoked a low
whistle.
"To know Russian is rather a large
order, and I spoke with perfect truth
when I denied the soft impeachment,"
he muttered. "But I know' enough
about it to know that this is not Rus
sian at all."
> The qddress was "A. M. Serjov, Poste
Restante, Copenhagen," but the body
of the telegram bore no resemblance to
any European language, â¢ and It re
quired but little Insight on Fortescue's
part to perceive that It was a cipher.
It was quite short,, and as there was a
twenty' minutes' wait at Amiens he had
plenty, of time to copy the original on
to a form, instead of handing it to the
clerk, with a tip for making the tran
script, as he had intended.
"I wonder what felony I am abet
ting," he thought, as he. placed the or
iginal in his pocket-book after handing
in the form. "I could hardly have

"I hope you have not had bad
news?"
"Yes, If to learn that I have been
made a fool of through meddling In

rudely, glaring: at Laura so pointedly
that 6he could not mistake his mean
ing any more than she would refuse
his challenge. "Poor lima! So he's a
bounder after all." she thoujht, but
aloud she said â
"You have perhaps heard, mon
sieur, that Colonel Delaval was. after
all, a perfect gentleman â an equal of
your own?"
"I have heard that he was accred
ited to me byâ by a friend to whom
his dismissal In that way Is .a gTOSs In
sult," retorted Dubrowski roughly.
"This letter, which is from one of the
highest of the Russian nobility.
vouches for him and asks me to do all
in my power for him should he apply
to me in Breslau. Your friend is well
nigh as suspicious as yourself, lima."
He w?_s rapidly losing control of
himself, and in shame and sorrow li
ma tried to draw Laura Metcalf away.
But the English girl's temper was
roused. Knowing what she did. she
was not going to brook open Insult
from one for whom she had risked so
much, on the score of a dyni^nitard's
"res j-ectabi lily."
"Allow me to tell you then, mon
sieur, that the sooner you give your
noble friends name to the police the
better," she rejoined. "We â my
friends and Iâ were not going to men
tion it, for Ilma's sakfe, but now you
had better be informed that your
friend's American friend,* before he was
lurried out, placed an infernal machine
in the chimney of his bedroom. That
rocm backed on to the Tsar's apart
ments."
lima uttered a low cry, and laid her
hand beseechingly on Laura's arm.
'"Heed him not. dear, he Is not him
self." ehe pleaded. "I have tried so
hard to save him, but he will not let
me. If this were known and could be
proved, as I quite believe, It would
mean death or exile."
Laura gulped down her wrath, and
relapsed into English.
"I shan't Fplit, you poor darling," she
replied. "After the fuss I had to get
the thing safely out of the house I
couldn't stand any nonsense about De
laval, but it shall never go beyond us
three â and two good friends of mine."
She reckoned without Dubrowskl,
however. The aspersion on the writer
of the letter had fanned his passion to
a white heat, and he was evidently
about to repeat hie insults direct when
he saw a chance of varying his method.
They had sapped In an open space
where three streets met under a group
of trees, and at that moment he caught
sight of Volborth crossing the road to
ward them, arm in arm with Fortes
cue. He did not know the latter, but
his rage had vanquished good breeding.
"Here, Paul!" he cried excitedly.
"You .write romances. Here's an En
glish ycrjns lady with an imaginative
mind who should furnish you with good
material. She has found a beautiful
mare's nest about an American who,
after getting Into the house next the
Etadthaus. left an Infernal machine
aga.ir.st the wall of his Majesty's apart
ments. This desperate criminal bore an
introduction to myself, mind you.
How's that for a likely tale?"
There was little fear of Laura recog
nizing the fussy German of the previ
ous night In the polished gentleman
â¢who mildly replied:
"It would be a pleasure to work out
such a reailstic plot. Who knows but
I may try some day? But seriously, my
dear Boris, this is not a tale, whatever
its foundation, that you should shout
from the housetops. You. ought to
know o-ur Russian methods better. â¢ It
would not be pleasant for you If a
breath of this disturbed the keen nos
trils of the section."
"See to Mademoiselle Vassili!" cried
Forte6cue, springing .forward Just in
time to save lima from falling. She
was quietly fainting against the circu
lar fence that protected one of the
municipal trees. .
CHAPTER VII
THE CIPHER CODE.
Late that night of Saturday, the 6th
cf September, Spencer Fortescue was
sitting in his room at the hotel, en
gaged upon a despatch to the Foreign
Office, when a letter was brought to
him. The bearer was a silent individu
al, who insisted on delivering the mis
sive In person, and bowed, himself out
directly his errand was discharged; but
a glance at the calligraphy was suffi
cient to reveal the writer. The neat
characters recalled the days when Vol
borth had piled his English co-operator
v.Ith many of the same sample at Bel
grade.
The letter was as follows
"DEAR FORTESCUE: Understanding
that you flro to escort Lady and Miss
Metcalf to England via Boulogne, start
ing lK-noe on Monday. I am going to ask
a service from you. Melton, the English
police officer, writes me that he is at
Boulogne shadowing Delaval, against
whom, however, be has nothing definite
Just thatâ neither more nor Jesf.
"Russians don't have friendsâ among
Russiansâ or it is a case where, say in
England, could this be possible there, a
word fn season frqm an older man
might have clapped the brake on long
ago," the young attache had said to
himself while trying to make allow
ances. ,
So It was that, as a man of honor,
he could not instantly decide to under
take the commission at Boulogne. It.
was necessary first to be quite certain
that it in no degree Infringed his prom
ise to Laura, and after due delibera
tion he concluded that It did not. . Vol
borth already knew all there ' was to
know of the use of Dubrowski's name
by Delaval, and the conveying of the
message to the English detective could
neither benefit nor injure the object of
his and Laura's solicitude. Before
going to bed he wrote a note assenting
to Volborth's request. . '
The same silent messenger called In
the morning for his reply, and returned'
shortly with a photograph of Olga Pa
litzin, the one word "Thanks". .being
scrawled on the flan of the envelope.
That day being Sunday,- there were no
public functions, and Fortescue . spent
the greater part of it with the Met
calfs, seeing nothing of Volborth till,
the Monday morning, when he caught
a glimpse of him In one of the carriages
cc.-nveying the departing Russian yisi-;
tors to the station. The agent of the
section appeared to have no deeper de- ;
sign on hand than the amusement of
Countess Vasslli, whose shaking shoul
ders testified to the success of bis ef
forts, lima looked grave and pre^c-
had befriended In some way which he
had yet tp learn, was the undoubted
original of the photograph given him
by Volborth as that of the arch-nlhil
lst.'Olga Palltzln.
'"I felt sure, mademoiselle, that you
were English, and therefore that "I
should not appeal to you in vain," said
the stranger in soft, melodious tones.
"The man In the cloak did not board
thÂ« train, you 'say, or approach this
carriage? Ah. well, then I owe you as
many thanks for the Intention as I
should have tendered for the actual
service."
"One of Laura's quixotics escapades,
though on this occasion I think it was
really called for," explained Lady Met
calf, on whom the title "Princess" had
made impression.
"It was like this," interrupted Laura,
"The Princess came to the door, and,
after Introducing herself, begged us to
take her In, as she was being dogged
by a spy of the. Russian police.. Just
think of it! For no earthly reason but
' that she left St. Petersburg In a hurry
to visit M. Worth in Paris! It is really
too abominable, and If I catch any. of
those Third Section sneaks prowling
about Blairgeldle when the Tsar is at
Balmoral I'll put our gillies on to
them." And turning to her protege.
Laura translated her threat Into
French, evoking thereby a fresh meed
of thanks and a whole battery of
smiles, some of which overflowed and
Cook in Fortescue.
THIS is the third install
ment of "By a Hairs
Umultli/' Headon Hill's
"remarkable novel about the
Czar and the dreaded "Third
Section," which will be com
pleted next Sunday. Because
of its peculiar, timely in
terest, as well as for the
thrill and swing of the story
itself, this book has already
created a sensation. It will
be followed immediately by
"The Fugitive," another
$1 50 novel for 20 cents, of
which you will hear much
more in detail next Sunday.
*t present, except that he has been seen
in the' company of certain notorious
Irish-American desperadoes. . Now I
want Melton to be apprised of Delaval's
portmanteau attempt, but I want It done
unofilcially. and by word of mouth, my
reason being that, if I notify him in
writing or by telegram, he will be-bound
by your red-tape system to report the
matter to his superiors at Scotland Yard.
This, as you may be unwilling to con
fess, but probably know, would result, in
noisy excursions and alarums, and in the
ultimate escape of the highly placed
criminals whom I must run to ground.
Will you, old comrade. see Melton at
Boulogne, tell him what was discovered
after he left, and explain why I commu
nicate in this way? It is necessary that
Delaval should not be lost sight of. as
sooner or later he Is sure to lead us. to
the Princess P â , of whom our foreign
agents have no certain trace. My be
lief is that she is in Boulogne, and that

sion to gain access at Von Llndberg's.
went back to her for Instructions, when
she gave him Dubrowskl's name to con
jure with." At the name time she proba
bly posted the letter to Dubrowski which
caused the upset to-day.
"I have managed to stop Dubrowski's
insane cackle about the Dolaval incident
by showing him that, whether Miss Met
calf 3 assertion is true or false, not only
would It be awkward for him, but that
It would subject the writer of the letter
introducing Delaval to a police inquiry.
His infatuation for the Princess will. I
doubt not, keep him quiet, but he per
sists in believing: that Miss Metcalf in
vented the story at the instigation of
Mile. Vassili. Poor fool! He will sing
to a different tune when, at the close of
these proceedings, 'Herr Winded' reap
pears to sustain the allegation of your
charming fiancee.
"Mile. Vassili is recovering from the
shock of hearing the dear Boris furnish
m* with what he rightly described as
'excellent material.' The unfortunate
girl, for whom I have a sincere pity,
would be fainting still if she knew that
be was telling me what your delightful
Miss Laura would call a 'chestnut.' Hpr
Majesty, the Empress, has commanded
her to rest within doors | till we leave
Breslau", *o that the two friends will not
meet again here, which is, I think, as
well.
"One word more, and this also you
may pass on to Melton. I have arranged
with the Austrian police authorities to
connive at the escape of Anna Tchigorin,
and by now she should be at large. My
reason for taking what may appear an
overbold step you will appreciate. ShÂ«*
is fairly certain to make with nil speed
for the rendezvous where that queen
wasp the Princess is at work, and fail
ing- a clew through Delaval I thought it
well to provide a se"cond. Anna will be
followed by two of our best men from
the moment of her leaving jail at Vi
enna.
"I think'that that is all. my dear For
tescue â except to assure you tliat If you
do not care about doing: my little com
mission at Boulogne, your refusal will
place no strain on our mutual relations.
I shall know that you refusÂ» for good
reason. The same man who brings this
will call for your reply to-morrow, ac I
do not think we should be seen together
again here. The enemy may yet have
eyes in Bresliu. and they miffht see
enough in our meetings to lead to com
plications. If your reply is an affirma
tive, I shall send you a photograph of
the Princess Palitrin, in case you should
chance upon her; I shall also vrlre to
Melton to meet you on Rrrival at Biu
logpe. We start on Monday, via Gorlitz
and Kiel, for Copenhagen. Communici
tlons to me.Bt the latter place should be
addressed care of, the Chief of Police.
Yours. ; ' V. Â¦
Fortescue threw himself back in his,
chair to consider. He would have as*
eented to Volborth's request at once
but for one thing. He had dined that
evening at the Bareness von Ltnd
berg's, and Laura Metcalf had taken
the earliest opportunity of drawing
him aside.
"Spencer, who is that man, Paul Vol
borth, with whom you were walking
when you met us?" she asked.
He guessed what had happened, but
he merely saidâ
"An old friend of mine â an official
friend, so to speak. He is attached to
the Tsar's suite to chronicle the events
of the tour, he tells me."
"Don't you believe him, then," Laura
replied hotly. "He's a spy of the Rus
sian policeâ at least lima says so, and
she ought to know. See what she has
written me."
She handed him a note which had
been brought round from the Stadt
haus late in the afternoon. In it lima
endeavored to explain her sudden faint
ing fit, an'd in doing so hinted plainly,
but without mentioning names, at the
cause of the estrangement between her
self and Boris- She even confided her
suspicions of the terrible use that was
being made of her faithless lover, her
object being to warn Laura against
the Monsieur Volborth, with whom she
was distressed to see that Mr. Fortes
cue was on terms of acquaintance.
The letter wound up with a pathetic
appeal to her "dear English friend" to
throw every obstacle in Volbgrth's way,
and to persuade her lover- to do the
same, in the event of one whom she be
lieved to be aq agent of the Third Sec
tion using the weapon which Boris had
rashly placed in his hand. She wan
feeling better, lima said, but she would
not be able to see Laura again till they
met in Scotland, when she hoped that
her warning about Volborth would be
more than ever observed. She pledged
herself to watch Boris unceasingly lest
harm should come to their Majesties
through his folly, and her loyalty might
be depended on to sacrifice him If ne
cessary. But though all was over be
tween them she was bent on saving
him from the terrible punishment that
she feared he had incurred already, if
the Third Section could pet proofs.
"That Volborth must be an awful
wretch," Laura had said on his re
turning the letter. "I cannot under
stand the principle on which you choose
your friendsâ to know a horrid sneak
of a Epy, and at the same time to be
chums with a nice old party like Herr
WInckel."
"Volborth has been useful to me in
my work," had been Fortescue*s eva
sive reply.
"Well, you must promise me faith
fully not to be useful, to him in hisâ so
far as it. means- hounding down Cap
tain Dubrowski," Laura had urged. "I
don't despair of bringing those two to
gether again if I get a fair chance in
Scotland. You wouldn't like to think
that good old WInckel and I had
pranced about at midnight with a lot
of dynamite only to have our trouble
for nothing, would you?",- >
Fortescue had at once given the as
surance that he would not assist Vol
borth to Dubrowskl's detriment. Not
only was he unable to resist the plead
ing of the brave young face upturned
to his, but Laura's request was In ac
cord with his own feelings. Unmanner
ly cub and faithless lover as Du
browski had Bhown himself, Fortescue
had a truly English horror of taking a
mean advantage, and Volbortb's policy
toward the Junior aide de camp seemed
as he could. The Princess, who had
shown no particular interest in the
Journeylngs ( of her sovereign, seemed
much more eager! tol discuss French
art and artists, and was sparkling,
caustic, and coquettish by terns. So
far. In all probability, she had a genu
ine gratitude to, and a real desire to
please, the English party who had be- |
friended her.
And all the time, while chatting
gayly, Fortescue was thinking,, think
ing, till, with his mind made up, he
commenced his campaign. There was a
break in the conversation as the train
rattled through the station of St. Just,
and Laura, who had quite appreciated
his motive. In avoiding Breslau topics,
was never 'more surprised In her life
than when he harked back. t to the
pageants in the Silesian capital. But a
still greater shock was in store for her.
"The German visit would go down to
history as a pomplete success, but for
one regrettable , discovery which rumor
couples with it," he said at length.
"Yes? And that was?" murmured the
Princess sweetly. ,
"That an officer of the imperial staff
was suspected of giving information
and assistance to nihilist conspira
tors," was the reply which called into
play all Laura's superb, faith in her
lover to keep her from shouting at him.
As.lt was, she tried to touch his foot
with hers; but, avoiding her eye, For
tescue continued to address the Prin
cess, who was regarding him fixedly.
"It was only a rumor, so far as I could
ascertain." he went on, "but there's
usually flre of some sort at the bottom
.of suoh ugly smoke as that."
\ There was a distinct pause, and he
noticed that the Princess was tapping
the floor of the carriage with her boot
heel. Beyond that she yielded no sign
of being moved, and when she spoke
again It was in her singularly even
tones. ' .,- . i,
"I am acquainted with several offi
cers of the staff. What was the sus
pect's name*" she asked.
"Ah, of that I cannot Inform you."
replied Fortescue. "His name has not
yet been given to the public."
Laura breathed freely again.
"That was a diplomatist's answer,"
she thought. "Spencer must be play
ing a game when he takes the trouble
to wrap up a lie in tiuth like that."
"And does the rumor Include the offi
cer's arrest?" pursued the Princess, her
manner betokening that she was al
ready wearying of the subject.
"I heard nothing of an arrest, and af
ter all the whole thing may be only
the idle gossip, of the hotel lobbies,"
Fortescue replied, leaving Laura more
mystified than ever, and the Princess
completely apathetic. She remained si
lent for a few minutes, watching the
fleeting landscape, and then engaged
Lady Metcalf Irs a discussion of the
cuisine at the Grand, which lasted till
a glimpse of Boves station presaged
that they were within a quarter of an
hour of Amiens. .
Then she leaned back in her seat, and
producing a sheet of note paper from
the Inner pocket of her fur pelisse, be
gan to write slowly and thoughtfully
upon it with a miniature gold pencil
case. By the time she had finished, the
express was slowing down for its first
and only stop at Amiens, and she
looked across at Forteacue, who, with
frivolous talk, was seconding Laura's
gallant efforts to appear unconcerned.
The attache's supreme hope was that
the Princess was taking them for a
party of thick-headed tourists, and the
request that she had to prefer reas
sured him on that head.
"You have been so kind to me, you
dear English, tkat I am assured that. I
withheld it, though. That would have
scared the birds before Volborth has
had time to lime the twig."
On his return to the compartment the
Princess expressed her gratitude cour
teously, but as one who has the right
to command favors, and straightway
dismissed the incident to resume her
conversation with Laura. This had
drifted to a dissertation by the heiress
of Blairgeldle on the proper way to
conduct a grouse driveâ a subject In
which the" Princess showed an Interest
altogether unaccountable, till she ex
plained that she was eager to know
how her beloved sovereign the Tsar
would be amu3ins himself In Scotland.
"Oh., well, you mustn't take my de
scription as applying to a swell like
him," Laura said. "He'll be sure to
have a man at hte back ready with a
camp stool, another with a brandy
flask, and half a dozen loaders with
spare guns. I expect he'll go to work
much the same as the South African
millionaires who have taken to renting
moorsâ a lot of fuss, and nothing to
show for It but empty cartridge cases."
"Laura!" exclaimed Lady Metcalf
loftily. "You forget that you are
speaking disrespectfully of the Princess
Palitzln's- Emperor."
But the Princess only smiled sweetly
and pressed her inquiries so persistent
ly that Forescue, while freely prof
fering Information, promised himself
that the selection of the Tsar's loaders
should receive special attention. The
talk ran on sport, chiefly Scottish, till
the train reached the town station at
Boulogne, when a point on which For
tescue had been curious was cleared
up. The Princess was not goinjr to
cross the channel. Gathering her furs
around her and taking her sealskin
handbag, she bade farewell to "her
kind English friends'* and left th*
train.
Ten minutes later the train steamed
on to the landin*-itaÂ«e, and before It
came to a standstill Ledy Metcalf de
clared that nothing should Indue* her
to go on board the boat. Torrents o*
rain were falling, and a wild sou'
wester had raised a sea outside the
harbor that was more than a good ex
cuse for a professed bad sailor. They
would go to a hotel, shÂ« said, and wait
till the sea was smooth.
Fortescue was giving the lnstruottens
made necessary by the change of plans
to a baggage inspector, when soxn* â¢Â«â¢
at his elbow said â
"You are not crossing, then, after all,
sir?"
Turning, he saw Melton, the detse
tive. for whom he had hitherto looked
In vain.
"No, and so there is no hurry." he re
plied. "I must take two ladles with
whom I am traveling to the Hotel de
l'Europe, and then I shall be at your
service. Will you come to the hotel?"
"I will be there almost as soon as you
are." said Melton, falling back to scru
tinize the few passengers who were
about to brave the fury of the storm.
So it was that a little later, while
Lady Metcalf and Laura were being
shown to their apartments, Fortescue
waited In the hall of the hotel for In
spector Melton. The latter was as
good as his word, and came in almost
Immediately, shaking the water from
his streaming mackintosh.
"Now, Mr. Fortescue, here is a quiet
corner," he said. "I am burning to
hear this bit of nfrs which our friend
Volborth wouldn't write or wire." j_
Confining himself to the actual disf
covery of the infernal machine. For
tescue delivered his message In as few
words as possible. There was no need,
nor had Volborth requested him, to
mention the undercurrents of the plotâ
the Dubrowski-Palitzln Intrigue and
Ilma's relations with her loverâ but it
seemed that there- was quite sufficient
In his communication to make the
Scotland Yard officer first look grave
and then angry*
"Confound the tortuous ways of
these Russians!" exclaimed Melton.
"Why on earth couldn't Volborth, who
personally Is one of the best, do the

before It was too late?"
"Too late!" It was Fortescue'* turn
to exclaim. "Do you mean that Dela
val has given you the slip?"
"Not quite so bad as that. I let him
go myselfâ for value received, as I
thought, in the way of Information.
And now by the light of what you
have told me It is on the cards that the
Information will turn out to be worth
less.and that all I shall havÂ» to show
for the beggar will be the key to a ci
pher code which is of no use to me.**
"You have his cipher key? Coma,
Mr. Melton, that is good work any
how," said . Fortescue cheerily. "X am
not flat enough to try to pump you.
but I should listen with Interest to
anything you might feel Justified In
telling me. What do you say to some
lunch In the restaurant?"
CHAPTER VIII.
THE HOUSE IN THE RUE ST. POL.
The inspector having accepted the
Invitation, Fortescue ran up to Lady
Metcalf's apartments and excused
himself from lunching in the private
sitting-room which she had ordered.
His plea of having met a friend suf
ficed for the elder lady, but Laura, fol
lowed him out to the landing.
"I* hope you haven't met another
questionable friend like that M. Vol
borth," she said. "But seriously.
Spencer. I could not understand you in
the train. I was afraid you wero go
ing to v give Captain Dubrowskl away
to the Princess."
"If I went by the favorable Impres
sion she has made 'on yon. little girl,
there Â¦wouldn't bo much harm In that,"
Fortescue replied tentatively.
"She hasn!t made any particular Im
pression on me except that she is a bit
of a cat." returned Laura spitefully.
"I befriended her as I would any one
who was being bullied by those beasts
of Russian police spies, but I wasn't
best pleased with the way she took to
ogling: you. sir." Then with a quick
change of manner came the question,
"You had some deep motive In telling
her about the suspected implication of
a staff officer?"
"Yes, I had a motive." said Fortescue
gravely, "one which I believe those
sharp wits of yours have guessed al
ready. I had a reason for thinking
that through this Princess Olga Palit
zlnâno matter howâ the news would
be conveyed to Ilma's rival that Du
browskl is under suspicion. You see
the effect? The unseen charmer, who
has the young cub In her tolls, will, if
I am correct, cease to use him as a
medium in the dangerous movement of
which the Russian police have wind."
"You will certainly have the Paris
embassy some day If you go on like
this." was the complimentary reply.
"I thought you were playing a game,
but that was a stroke of genius. How
delighted lima will be!"
"I must run away before you turn
my head with flattery. Besides* I am

BY A HAIR'S BREADTHdraft of the telegram which I foollshjy
confl Jed to you. It is useless to deny
that you had the code. I saw the man
Melton'hand It to you, and I saw you
compare It with the telegram." .
No one knew better than Fortescue
that 1 o was In danger of liis life, for
after; this they would not dare to let
him go, but at that moment his upper
most feeling was one of irritation with
himself at the false step he had made
In | not allowing for a recognition of
Melton by one or other of the conspira
tors. Or.lt. might be â he hoped It was
soâ that Melton had been recognized
from Delaval's description, and that
the nature of the document handed to
him Â¦ had been an after-conclusion.
Either way. the situation was the same,
and had to be faced.
"I have not the code or the telegram
with me," he replied, feeling his pistol
with - the hand which he had kept In
his pocket. J- second later the weapon
was out and leveled straight at the
beautiful head of the Princess, as in
response to her signal half a dozen men
filled the doorway. They were veno
mous-Iooklng ruffians of the continen
tal j anarchist . type, /and held knives In
their hands.
"Keep your ruffians back or you are
a dead woman!" "cried Fortescue.
"Hands on the table, Delaval, If you
don't want your leader shot!" he added,
as the Irish-Aitfeiican began to fumble
at his : hip. "Now see here," he went
on, speaking in Fretich so that those
at the doo'r might understand, * "It is
very probable that all you. people will
succeed in killing me, but on one point
I ani quite decided. At the first move
ment toward that amiable Intention â
at the lifting of a fingerâ I send a bul
let-into the Princess." / .
If he had been lax in taking care of
himself at the outset, his promptness
now -had him, temporarily at
least, master of the situation. With
that shining barrel . threatening the
most Important life in the room he had
got- the whole gang "bal!;d up." The
bearded veteran was gibbering like an
ape; and Delaval muttering oaths. Ol
ga Palitzin alone preserved her calm.
y : "You are a brave and a capable man,
Mr.* Fortesctue," , she ; said,' "too brave
and cleyerTto go hence alive. I regret
it on some grounds, but I must employ
other means to put an 'end to this
deadlock.", And raisins her voice, but
"Really, Princess Palltzin, I don't un
derstand the tone or the drift i of your

Delaval also has ' to thank your party

berg's?" '
further need for concealment ba*s*e
him. There -was a further deduction
from that ominous inference which he
tried to put from him. -
"Is it the same?" asked the Princess,
in her even, expressionless tone.
"It is the same," Delaval replied, re
garding Fortescue with an ugly sneer.
"Pray be seated," said the Princess,
acknowledging her visitor for the first
time, and pointing to a chair facing her
from the other end of the table.
"There are one or two, questions I
would ask of you, and after thatâ yes,
after that I think we shall have fin
ished with him, eh, gentlemen?"
In response the Irish- American
emitted an unpleasant grating chuckle,
and the gray beard nodded his head
thrice, his cavernous eyes glowing
fiercer than ever. Fortescua was pro
ceeding to seat himself with , as great
an assumption of careless ease as he
could muster when stealthy footfalls â
not of one man, but of several â in the
passage caused him to move the chair
so that he could see the door as well as
his Interviewers. Every sense In j his
body was on the alert, and he did not
'mean to be taken In the rear.
"Two things, Mr. Fortescue. have
combined to put a new, complexion. on
our relations since this morning," be
gan the Princess. "In the first place,
have since met my friend Colonel De
laval here, and he has told me some In
teresting facts about my I kind fellow
travlers from Paris. ..-That they or
some of them deprived him of the hos
pitality of the Baroness von Lindbprg
at Breslau, for instance."
All this candor had a nasty signifi
cance for Fortescue,' but he v answered
coolly enough: â¢;
"The reason for that was sufficiently
explained to Colonel Delaval at j| the
time. He ; readily acquiesced in It I
do not imagine that ha was seriously
inconvenienced in having to leave that
house ' Just t then." '
The Princess waved her hand impa
tiently. - f . Â¦ Â¦'.'''.
So he reflected as the cab began to
ciimb the steep streets of the old town,
and he knew that he must Jae nearing
his destination. The garish lights of
shops and hotelsâ the noisy watering
place racketâ had long since been left
behind, and they were threading a net
work of narrow, Ill-lighted thorough
fares, curiously quiet by contrast, in
which the dark old houses had an air
of shy retirement. Fortescue was
more at home in capitals than pleasure
resorts, but he remembered hearing
that the Rue St. Pol bore a none too
savory reputation.
Suddenly the cab drew up at a house
which, but for a glimmer In the fan
light over the door, might well .have
been vacant, so dark were Its windows
and uncared for Its approach. For
tescue, who knew the exterior of the
Palitzin palace on the Great Morskala
at Petersburg, felt Instinctively for his
pistol. That the owner of that splendid
pile should be domiciled in this dingy
abode struck home to him. the possi
bilities he might find on the other side
of the threshold.
Bidding the driver wait, ha mounted
the moldy steps and tugged at an old
fashioned Iron bell-pull, which caused
a long-continued clangor far away.* in
some distant basement. But, ; as evi-.
denchig that a janitor was ready and
waiting, the door was swiftly and si-,
lently opened almost as soon as the bell
began to ring, and an â¢ under-sized,
shock-headed man whom he had never
seen before confronted him. No words
passed. The doorkeeper, who ; must
have been furnished with a description
of the expected visitor, looked him up
seir on oeing a prosaic person,, he
laughed at himself accordingly. From
that, as the cab rattled,over the cobbles
away fpom the smells of the waterside
toward the Haute Ville, he fell to anal
yzing the motives which had induced
him to plunge into an affair that made
the possession of a pistol seem desir
able.,
"Laura's enthusiasm and a feeling
that that poor beggar Dubrowski was
being treated unfairly started me. And
now, having, I trust, relieved him at
Volborth's expense, I am smitten with
a desire to furnish the astute Paul
with a quid pro quo In the way of In
formation. - And â yes, I have a taste
for this sort of thing. It is good train-
Ing."
A ' moment later, when the front
door snapped behind her, she found
herself in the narrow hall, with a
group of forbidding looking men clua~
tered round a doorway. They parted
right and left for her to enter, which
she did without hesitation, and then
they closed up In solid phalanx In the
rear, as tha tableau of her lover with
his pistol aimed at the head of tha
Princess was revealed. Fortescue, out
of the corner of the eye which he was
keeping on the door, saw with a, thrill
of. horror what had happened, and It
was nearly" his undoing. Delaval's
hand began to fumble again. That
braced Fortescue and he steadied hla
pistol. Olga was the first to. speak:
"You have brought the papers. Miss
Metcalf?"
Laura laughed in her most engag
ingly impudent manner. "WÂ«a It
"Show him up Instantly," sne said,
tossing the book aside, and a minute
later she was trying to understand the
bad French of an under-sized man
with a shock head of hair topping a
most forbidding countenance.
"The monsieur wants me to bring
him the Â¦ papers? Is that what you
mean 7 " she said, eying him sharply.
"What papers?"
This was a poser which It seemed
could bnly be met by inarticulate gurg
lings.
"Where is Mr. Fortescue â in the
Rue St. Pol?" Laura asked quickly. It
was not like her "sucking ambassador"
to set her such a task at that time of
night, and she became conscious of a
vague uneasiness about him, which
was not lessened by the evil smile with
which the man replied In the affirma
tive.
"Very well, then, I will come," sha
said. "You - have a cab? Good! Go
downstairs; I will follow immediately."
Running to her room for a cloak and
hat she was down in the hall at his
heels, and entered the cab, which, by
the way, was not the one which had
brought the messenger. Throughout
the drive she did not speak, not be
cause she was in the least afraid of
her unkempt companion, but out of an
Innate aversion for . him. The man
smelt of drink and some vile com
pound of tobacco. Only when they
drew up at the door she asked, not lik
ing the look of the house:
"The Princess Palitzin is here?"
"But how is he behaving?" persisted
Laura, feelinsr that if it would mend
matters she would like to take tha
young guardsman by the scuff of his
peck and bring him back to his allegi
ance. "Is he any â "
"How beautiful is that silver mist
.resting on the purple mountain," said
lima suddenly, as Fortescue, having
put the table to rights, came forward
to join the two girls. His face wora

alertness, but somehow he did not look
very well. There were blue circles un
der his eyes, and his cheeks had fallen

more presently.
Now Uma's Instantly perceived In
tention to change the subject at For
tescue's approach, by Its Implied want
of confidence, came as a sharp littla
heart-stab to honest Laura, and sha
determined to put that matter right
once for all. So far, by mutual agree
ment, she and her lover had kept their
perilous adventure at Boulogne to
themselves, and, as a natural conse
quence, the events that led to it, thÂ«
only exception being Volborth, to
whom Fortescue had forwarded a full
report to Copenhagen. But it had beta
thought safer in Ilma's own interest to
write nothing of what happened to her.
and she was therefore ignorant of
what had been done to divert Dubrow
skl's peril.
So, when Fortescue came up, LanrÂ»
said: "lima has been telling ma thai
nothing Jumpy happened at Copen
hagen, and I think she ought to kno-r
to whom that is due." And turning tÂ«
lima she added: "Do you know, dea*,
that by an extraordinary chanca wÂ«
met the Princess Palitzin in tha train.
and this astute young man played hay
so diplomatically that I doubt If sha*4

Dubrowski. Established a funk, yva
know." ' And Laura proceeded to de
scribe how Fortescue had Imparted to
the arch-Nlhlllst the rumor of a stall
officer of the Tsar being under sus
picion. There she stopped short, leav
ing It to her lover. If he chose, to nar
rate the scene in the Rue St. Pol.
But the Immediate effect was for tha
moment to Increase Ilma's alarm. Sha
knew that she had not mentioned Olga
Palltzin by name In her letter to Laura,
and the litter's identification of her
fellow-passenger with her own un
named rival could only have one sig
nificanceâthat Fortescue was deep in
the counsels of Volborth, and was to be
proportionately mistrusted.
The look which she cast at her
friend's lover was In truth a mute ap
peal to remove her doubts of him.
"That Was indeed most generous,
most skillful â If only,** she was begin
ning when Fortescoe, who, with quick
Intuition, had divined the cause of her
fear, cut her short.
"In plain English. If only I did It In
your service, and not In that of tha
Russian secret police," he said genially.
"One moment. Mademoiselle Vassill. "
he went on, as lima raised her hand in
protest at having been read so literally,
"I am glad of an opportunity of making
this quite clear. My first object in all
that I have done in this matter baa
been to help you, as Laura's friend, to

morning, and arriving only half an

"There is very little to tell, and I
suppose I ought to call It good news,"
replied lima with a faint sigh. "That
is to say, nothing suspicious happened
at Copenhagen, and I do not think
that M. Volborth pays so much atten
tion to Boris as formerly."
"And Captain Dubrowski hlmselSâ â¢
does he show signs of coming to his
senses?" pursued Laura eagerly.
"If you ask whether we "are any
nearer making up, I would answer that
there is not the most remote chance of
that." said lima decidedly. "It does
not now any longer depend upon
Boris," she continued, with a brighten
ing of the proud eyes. "I could not
marry a man who has forfeited all
claim to my respect â even should he do
me the honor to change his mind again.
All that I hope forâ for old love's saka

victorious player, remained to brush
the table and put away the balls.
"YoÂ« dear thing, it is good to havs

perching herself en the end of the set

CHAPTER IX.
"Retire all, and rendezvous at Center

look at the revolver which never wav
ered from her head. And ten seconds
later, save for Laura and Fortescne.
with his pistol still pointing at the
door whither his aim had followed tha
exit of the Princess, the room was
empty. Somewhere at the back a door
banged, and all was silent.
"Efface yourselvesâ If you have tha
means," she cried In French. "I hava
come to you straight from prison, and
only hereâ at the doorâ I find that I
am followed! The spies of the section
are outside. Our future movements
will be traced."
The three heads at the table bent low
together in conclave, and Laura moved
to Fortescue's side.
"Leave it to me, darling,** hÂ« mur
mured.
"I'm going to. You appear to have
gpt the drop on her, as the Yankees
say," was the reply.
And then suddenly, while the whis
pered conference was still In progress,
an Interruption occurred. Tha front
door snappe^, there was a stir among
the rascals at the room door, and a
handsome, wild-eyed woman pushed
through them. Murmurs of "Anna-
Anna Tchigorin!" arose. â¢

what was up first, and it seems aa well
that I took that precaution. ArÂ© you

Spencer, and end this tomfoolery." {
Laura having Intimated that she
should not go to bed till he returned,
went back to her mother, and Fortescue
sought his own room to retch an ver
coat, for the night was chilly. Having
made the addition to his attire,-he was
about to leave when an after-thought
struck him. He opened his Gladstone
bag/and extracted a small \ revolver,
which he placed In his pocket.
The train of ideas bred of this action
lasted him all the way downstairs and
Into the cab which he had ordered. It'
suggested to him for the first time
that there was a spice of knighterran
try in the course on which he had era
barked, and, sines he had prided him-
"I expect there's something very
nice about both of usâ in you chiefly,
dear, fc-r your loyal faith," was the re
ply. And. as by this time they were
out pf the salon and no one about, the
mutual compliment was ratified In a
fashion that concerns no one but them
selves.
and tricks that are vain," she said, as
she locked the papers away into her
traveling-bag, that lay close at hand
en a console-table. "There must be
something very nice about you, I think,
to be able to indulge in all these mys
terious carryings-on without shaking
the confidence of yours truly."
There. was a putting together of the
three heads in whispered discussion.
"Herr Winckel'\ was evidently 'a puz
zle. ;
"Can you Inform me whether Res
tofakl, the Russian police agent, took
part In the discovery?" asked the
Princess, looking up.
"I have not the honor of M. Restof
ski's acquaintance," replied Fortescue,
glad thus to learn that^Volborth's In
cognito was still Intact. "And now.
Princess," he added with a determina
tion to test his own position,* "as I do
not seem able to give you much infor
mation, perhaps you will allow me to
take my leave."
. Delaval laughed coarsely, and the tall
old man's eyes blazed like live coals, as
the visitor rose to his feet
"Not so fast, Mr. Meddlesome Eng
lishman', If you please â tne house door
is w*ell guarded," cried the Princess,
throwing off all disguise.' "This is the
chief matter on which I desired your
attendance. Restore at once the cipher
code. which you got from the English
police c^cer this morning; also tha
cross-examination," : replied Fortescue
boldly. "I. heard something about the
removal pf a portmanteau by a German
gentlemanâ a Herr Winckel, I think,
was; the name." â¢
and down, admitted him and closed the
door instantly ' with a metallic snap
that somehow got on Fortescue's
sherve. - . Â¦ Â¦ s '
"Sounded like the click of a 4 mouse
trap," he thought, as the small man
turned the handle \ of a doo/ on the
right of the passage and motioned him
to enter. And the next moment, when
he passed Into 'the room, conviction
came to him that it was a , trap Into
which he had walked so easily. For,
seated at the head of a' shabby table
was Olga Palitzin, having on her right
the fierce-eyed old man who had been
with her at the restaurant, and on her
left Delavalâ very far from being on
his way back to America. One quick
glance round showed why. the house
from the outside appeared to be In ut-"
ter darkness. The windows were fur
nished with thick ( wooden shutters,
which were closed and barred.
The trio looked . up on Fortescue's
entrance, the Princess deliberately
folding a mao over, which they had
been poring. Her first words were ad
dressed, not to her visitor, but to De
laval and Fortescue was startled to
hear them spoken Incrisp English. Yin
the train she had carefully concealed
all knowledge of the language, and* this
open use of It Implied thxt she had' no
"Though I am not so sure that Vol
borth would be best pleased at having
to face a rearrangement of their plans
v.ith Dubrowski left out of his calcu
lations," he reflected as he rose from
the table. "I must salve my con
science by sending him a copy of De
laval's code â as a set-off against my
interference."
He had nearly reached the door of
the restaurant, when at table at a con
siderable distance from the one at
which he and Melton had lunched he
perceived the Princess Olga Palltzin
herself. He was sure that she had not
been there on his entering, and he had
Rc-t seen her before owing to the In
spector's detective instinct having
prompted him to appropriate the seat
facing the room. Fortescue had thus
had hjs back to the Princess. And now,
as he passed her table, she seemed to
be really unconscious of his presence.
Not for a moment did she relax her at
tention to the engrossing conversation
of her companionâ a tall, spare-framed
old man, with a long white beard and
shaggy brows overarching a pair of
fiery <le?p-set eyes.'
Forte;:eue passed out into the vesti
bule and stopped a hurrying waiter.
"Ascertain for me if the lady in the
furs. at the second-table from the door
and the gentleman with her are stay
ing in the hotel," he said.
But the srarcon was able to oblige
Monsieur without inquiry. Neither the
lady nor the gentleman was staying
in the hotel, but they had. patronized
the restaurant at intervals during the
last ten dsys for dejeuner and dinner.
Rewarding the man with a franc,
Fortescue ran up to his roc-m and be
gan to make a rapid change in his at
tire. After putting a spoke in Vol
burth's wheel in the matter of Dubrow
ski. h:> felt that ho could not re
pay his friend better than by following
the Princess when she left the restau
rant. He was aware of the difficulty
of shado-wing her in broad daylight, but
the chance that she might lead him to
the headquarters of the gangâ possibly
to that mysterious "No. 4 Center"â was
too good to be missed. Reinforced with
a knowledge of the lair, Volborth might
be trusted to set such a watch on the
comings and goings of the miscreants
that they would ba powerless for evil.
After plunging into a Norfolk jacket
and rummaging an old tweed hat from
the bottom of his "Gladstone," he
made his way again to the ground
floor â to find that he was too late. The
Princess and her fierce-eyed cavalier
had quitted the restaurant, and, as a
hasty ouestion put to the same waiter,
elicited, had departed from the hotel
two minutes before. The attache was
not addicted to profanity, but he v
hujled a full-flavored expletive at his
informant. A certain smug innocence
linking at the corner of the man's
mouth seemed to explain why the
Princess ard hÂ°r companion had cur
tai'ed that absorbing conversation.
Idealizing that abuse of the waiter
would not mend matters, he returned
to his roc-:n. and, having rehabilitated
himseif, joined Lady Metcalf and
Laura. The va't fell in torrents, and
there wns r.o question of goingrout.
Having denp his best to enliven their
after|oon. Fortescue din<v*I quietly with
the ladies in their private salon.
To-ward the c'.or-e of the meal, while
he was for the tenth lime earning
Laura's gratitude by -promising her
mother a smooth crossing on the mor
row, the garcon brought him a letter
which had just been left at the hotel.
At the sight of the envelope Fortescue
r.eedrd a!', his nerve to repress a start,
for the bold, free hand was the same
as that in which was traced the draft
telegram reposing in his ifbcket-book.
He managed to ask carelessly if the
messenger was waiting an answer, and
having received a reply in the negative,'
he obtained Lady Metcalf's permission
to read his note. It was in French, and
ran as follows:
Â¦KIT RUE' ST. rbl>, rOL'LOOXE.

Frrall service thlf morning, and from your
charming friends I also received much gener
ous assistance. On those slight grounds I ven

ing circun^tances. For reasons, which I will
c:]'!a!n. I must ask you to come alone.
Accept the assurances, monsieur, etc., etc.
OLGA PALITZIN.
Feeling that Laura's eyes were en
him as he read he schooled himself to
suppress his elation, which was great.
At any rate here, ready to hand to pick
up, was the thread that he had dropped
earlier in the day. The sense that he
owed reparation to Volborth for de
priving him of the clew through Du
browski to the conspirators had been
growing on him, and he promised him
self to see this adventure through. The
Idea of personal danger did not occur.
He knew that he had to deal with de
termined and resourceful criminals,
and though naturally fearless he
would not have trusted himself among
them If he had believed them to regard
him as an active antagonist. But be
yond the fact of his having been seen
In Melton's company there was nothing
to connect him with their natural foes,
and he did not think that a connection
had been made that way. The English
detective had certainly not recognized
Olga Palitzin and her companion in the
restaurant, though sitting where he
had a good view of them, and the pre
sumption was that he was equally un
known to them.
All this passed through Fortescue's
mind in a flash, and by the time he
had folded up the Invitation he was
ready to' meet the challenge of in
quiry in Laura's eyes. This he did by
an answering glance that hinted at the
postponement of open curiosity, but the
moment Lady Metcalf had been made
comfortable after dinner he drew
Laura aside.
"That note was from the Princess
Palltzin," he said, placing It In her
hand. "I am rather Inclined to go. I
have no Idea what the woman wants,
but through her I may be able to
further Improve lima Vassili's pros
pects."
"Then* go by all means," replied
Laura, quickly skimming the letter.
"I can't say I caught on to the lady,
after the firstâ she seemed bloodless
and Insincere."
"Well, I shall not be trusting her
with any secrets," said Fortescue. "I
am going to try to get at hers. And

documentsâ neither clean nor Interest
ing, but highly Importantâ which I do
not care to carry about me. Will you
take charge of them and not deliver

he took out and handed to her the
cipher code and the draft of the Prin
cess' telegram to Serjov.
Laura took them and perceiving their
cabalistic nature, made one of her ex
pressive grimaces. <

About the time that Fortescue raised
his weapon Laura Metcalf was saying
good-night to her mother, who was re

she settled down to pass the time till
her lover's return over the Joys and

still in the same unlmpassioned tones,
she spoke rapidly In Russian to tha
men at the door. What she said was
unintelligible to Fortescue, but the re
sult was Immediately apparent In the
slamming of the front door, followed
by the sound of wheels. He gathered
that a messenger had been despatched
on some errand, and that his waiting
cab had been used for the purpose.
"In the meanwhile and In any cir

"One word." persisted Laura, follow

"A member of the same family, dear,"
replied Fortescue, and he ran down the
â¢ stairs before the question could be
followed up, fearing that If his spirited
little sweetheart ferreted out the whole
â¢ truth there would be a scene In the
event of her meeting the Princess
while in Boulogne.
He found that Inspector Melton had
secured seats in the public restaurant
and was not only willing but caper to
return to the subject of Delaval. The
' rrason was soon apparent. True to his
decretive tactics. Volborth had not en
"lightened the English detective on the
Intricacies of the purely Russian phase
of the plot, and Melton was naturally
anxious to know all that Fortescue
could tell him. This was practically
nothing, for in the absence of permis
sion Fortescne did not feel justified in
disclosing what he had learned as a
consequence of private friendship. The
nev.s of Anna Tchigorin's release only
served to Increase Melton's Jre.
"Thar.k Volborth for nothing," he
eaid angrily. "If this precious Rus
sian caravan wasn't coming to Eng
land hÂ« might play a lone hand and
Â¦welcome, but how are we to be rcspen
eib.le over the Channel if he keeps back
the essence of what he knows? Anna

like this Delaval that I vant to get at.
Just see what n piece of work Vol
borth's nÂ«jt wiring the attempted out
rage at lirey'.au hts led to."
And the Inspector went on to relate
that his attention had first been
drawn to Delaval by seeing him in the
company of certain notorious Iri?h
â¢ Americans at Antwerp, and that on
that account he had followed him to
Breslau, where he should have commu
nicated with the German police on the
first occasion had not the man left
again Immediately for Boulogne.
There he remained for a few hours
only before starting again for Breslau.
with nearly the same result, except for
Melton's meeting with Volborth, who,
'however, had been more inquisitive
thnn communicative.
Again Delav*] had doubled back to
Boulogne with Melton closely shadow
ing him, and on the morning after ar
rival he had a?tonished the detective
by at costing him in the street. He
was aware, he said, that he h3d been
followed through associating with well
kr.o-wn bad characters, but that he
wished to withdraw from that associa

heads of the conspiracy may have

overboard by using them as a red
herring to draw us off the really dan
gerous characters."
Fortescue remained silent for some
' moments. There was clear and lucid
reasoning in Melton's deductions,
which have since been amply confirmed
by subsequent events known to the
'world.
"And â you mentioned a cipher?" he
said presently.
â¢ "Yes, I got that by the merest fluke
'âthough you were good enough to com
pliment me on It/' said the detective.
"I saw him off the day before yester
day In the morning. The same after
noon It was shown to me by the bar
maid at one of the English buffets
â¢ here which he frequented. The girl
knows me. and also knew that I had
been interested in Delaval."
"Did she grive you the code?" asked
Fortescue. concealing his eagerness.
â¢ The inspector's reply was the pro
duction of a bulky pocket-book, from
which he extracted a greasy sheet of
folded foolacap and threw it over to
Fortescue.
"There Is the confounded thing," he
'â¢aid. "Not much use. Is itâ with none
; of- their correspondence to decipher?"
Fortescue ran his eye over the code
with undisguised Interest.
"I don't know to what extent Vol
borth has incurred your displeasure,"
he said, "but if you win relent so far
. jls to let me make a copy of this for
him It might be very serviceable."
â¢ "Oh, I've got nothing against Vol
borth beyond his system," replied the
Inspector. "Copy It by all means-
Only I can't wait while you do It. as I
have to meet one of our men by the
afternoon boat via Calais. Keep the
.code and give it to me in the morning.
1 shall see you before you leave, and If
you'll excuse me now I will be off."
No sooner was Melton'gone than For
tescue took out the draft telegram
which he had despatched for the prin
cess at Amiens, and compared It with
Â£he cipher code. The latter, a very
brief scrutiny showed him, was appllc
. able, and a few minutes sufficed to
translate the instructions sent to
."Serjov, Poste Restante, Copenhagen,"
â¢into French, the sense being:
"Abandon attempt in Denmark. Du
brcrwski under suspicion, and useless for
further work. Plans must be rear
ranged, so rendezvous at No. 4 Center
forthwith. Olga Palltzin."
Folding ud the code and the draft
telegram he placed them in his pocket
book, well pleased with the prompt re
sult of his chance meeting with the
Princess. It was good to Jearn, for
lima Vassilt's sake, that her foolish
lover was to be discharged from his
perilous bondage; and to have flut
â¢ tered the dove-cotes of the conspira
tors seemed to make for the safety of
the Tsar. The delay of having to Ini
tiate fresh attempts would have that
effect, Fortescue thought, and the con
spirators, discouraged by previous
Â¦failures, might even *IvÂ« ud their vile
â¢projects altogether.
' THE- SAN FRANCISCO -SUNDAY- CALIi
3(Continued Next Sunday.)
And she went on to explain that the
roads on the Queen's property on the
left side of the Glen were closed, even
to the favored few who had permission
to use them, during the Tsar's stay;
but that by taking the public road on
the right of the Glen as far as Spital
they would be able to see what was go
ing on on the forbidden ground about
Blrkenhall.
"Let's go for a spin after lunch,"
raid Laura, who knew that lima was
booked for an inspection of the dairies

ar.re. "I can take you to a place

For Laura herself the doings of prin
cipalities and powers had for the time
faded â "taken a back seat" she would
ha\> called it â in face of the superior
attractions of a new bicycle. And in
this respect fortune favored her that
she was seated next another devotee Â«>f
the wheel, to whom she could enlarge
without the risk of boredom on the
spick and span nickel-plated charms of
the thirty-guinea "safety" which' she
had brought from London. Mr. Fitz
Harding, a retired Indian Judge, had
taken to the exercise late in life for
the sake of his liver, and though he
took a good deal more interest in his
damaged vital organ than in the ma
chine which was to cure it, he was able
to Jlsten sympathetically and technic
ally tti her enthusiasm.
The two girls moved off arm In arm,
and did not see the unwonted shadow
that crossed Fortescue's face.
"I am afraid we have braved their
vengeance â or. what is worse, their
sense of self-protection, already," he
muttered as he ran up to his room.
"What would she say If she knew that
Laura and 1 were believed, and rightly,
by the conspirators to be the only per
sons able to legally prove their identity.
I mustn't lose a moment in comparing
rotes with my little girl after lunch."
He had only arrived at Blairgeldie on
the previous night, and as the house
was full he had not yet had a tete-a
tete with Laura. And that such an in
terview was imperative certain happen
ings to himself during the three weeks
that had elapsed since their stoppage
at Boulogne had brought home to him
pretty forcibly. He had spent the time
in London, after seeing Lady Metcalf
and her daughter off to Scotland, and
he had not been three days in the me
tropolis when he began to have a vague
impression that he was being followed.
There was nothing definite to catch
hold of. But he had a quick eye for
faces, and there had been several curi
ous coincidences. One night on leaving
the Junior Carlton he recognized in
the cab-tout who closed the doors of
his hansom a man whom he had seen,
differently dressed, loafing on the pre
vious day in the hall of the Mansions
in Victoria street, where hi* flat was
situated. And .again, another Indi
vidual who. sleek and well-dressed, had
called one day at the Foreign Office to
see him on a matter that proved to be
trumped up, was certainly traveiing,Jn
the next carriage to his on the under
ground three days later in workman's
attiie. He had no intention of alarming
Laura, but realizing thai she chared
with him that dangerous knowledge,
he wanted to ascertain if sh.e had no
t'ced anything abnormal in her sur
roundings, and in that case to take
measure? for her protection. â¢
Dlairgeldle Castle being close to the
right shoulder of Glen Mulck, opposite
to th? royal demesne, and Sir James
Metcalf belonging to the charmed cir
cle of those select ones whom the
Queen speaks of as her Highland
"neighbors," the conversation at lunch
con naturally ran on her Majesty's
guests. The Tsar was shooting with
the Prince of Wales in tne neighbor
hood of Birkhall, Sir James was able
to inform the company; and Laura
supplied the Information . that the
Queen and the Tsarina were to drive
out to the Glassalt Shiel. Fortescue,
who ha.1 come in loo late to secure a
scat rear Laura, remembered with
satisfaction a hint that he had included
in his letter to Volborth anent the se
lection of the Tsar's sillies and loaders.
"One thing only I beg of you both."
she said, as they rose at the ringing of
the luncheon bell, "neither for my sake
nor that of any one have any more to
do with Russian intrigue. They are
deadly people, those who are working
with Olga Palitzin. and I would not
have you brave their vengeance open
ly."
An hour's chat with her two English
friends left lima composed and cheer
ful, so catching was Laura'i happy
optimism.
toward the end of the Danish visit had
become unusually quiet and thought
fulâas a result, she now believed, of
the sudden termination of letters and
telegrams from the Princess. Fortes
cue said nothing of the Boulogne in
cident, as it solely affected Volbroth's
conduct of the case.
After thr.t there was no more misun
d.:st;tndin?r. and Fortfscve went on to
expi.iln that from aJl points of view the
best thing that could happen would be
for Volborth to prevent attempts dur
ing the tour, and at the end to capture
the conspirators in some scheme in
which neither directly or indirectly was

They trudged along fqr some distance
in silence, Laura having declined his
offer to wheel poor punctured/ "Billy."
As they were nearing Ballater they
were met by tlie same tweed-coatd
lounger, and Laura thought she de
tected a glance ? of recognition and ' a
half gesture of respect, pass from him
to her companion. But ' if so the
It was always Laura's way to try to
act as she thought her lover would
have acted in like case, and not know
ing either the extent or the source of
Herr Wlnckel's knowledge of the Palit
zin plots she did pot pursue the matter.
She had learned from Fortescue that,
as In honor bound, he had acquainted
Volborth with all that had occurred at
Boulogne, but no one else. She was
not sure, therefore, whether this port
ly German's suspicions were the result
of complete enlightenment otherwise
gained, or of. mere surmise based on the
very palpable grounds which he was
twisting in his hands. He al3o showed
no inclination to go deeper into the In
wardness of the accident.
"Yes, I've .punctured both tires, and
shall have to walk 'Bliâ ' I mean my
bicycle home," she replied, checking
herself lest ghe should hurt her friend's
feelings by the Irreverent application
of his supposed sovereign's name.
"Ach, but there is oder things that
is worse to have bunchered than the
tires," was the reply.-whlch first caused
it to dawn on Laura that the Herr'a
appearance on these occasions was not
all chance. "Look! See what my
sharp old eyes have discover, on the
ground," he continued. And stepping
quickly back some twenty paces in the
direction whence s,he had come, he
stooped first on one side of the road,
then on the other, and returned, trail-
Ing some object, behind him, which he
wound up as he walked.
"Your agcldent was done on bur-
T>ose, Miss Medcalf," he said gravely.
"It was fortunate â most fortunate â
that I came up when I did."
And this time, whether voluntarily
or not, he allowed his-eys to gaze up
the road to where the bath chair and
its attendant were fast- fading in the
distance. Laura* surprised the look.
"You know those people, Herr
Winckel?" she said Ehortly.
"I know them by their works. You
travel this way often?" was the reply
â non-committal, but plain enough to
suggest his suspicions.
; "I have been here every day about
this time for a week," said Laura ey
ing with indignation the object which
he was gathering Into a clumsy ball.
The deliberate outrage on "Billy" af
fected her far more than Its possible
purpose, and that the outrage had
been very deliberate there was no room
to doubt.' The apparatus which Herr
Winckel was gathering into portable
shape consisted of a strip of buckram
of the color of the road with a row of
French nails inserted at intervals of
an inch. This had been stretched
across, and pegged down at each side
of the road, so that the buckram and
the heads of the nails lay flat on the
ground, while the points stuck upward.
A more Ingenious device for disabling
a pneumatic-tired bicycle, and f6r
bringing Its rider to a standstill, could
not have been contrived.
Laura held out her hand in frank
welcome, then glancing inquiringly
from his stolidly beaming face toward
the receding bath chair, of which, how
ever, he took no notice.
"How do you do, Herr?" she said.
"I am awfully glad to meet you again,
though you are about the last person
I should have expected to see. You al
ways turn up at the nick of time. I
have had an accident." ' '
"Ach! So? * The machine is all
broke?" said Herr Winckel, looking
abput him.
There smiting down at her between
two rowan trees, stood Herr Winckel.
dressed the same and looking In all re
spects the same as on the eventful
night at Breslau when he had proved
himself such a "handy old chap." He
had a companion with him â a short,
dark man whom he addressed in an un
known tongue as Regtofeki. The latter
having disappeared behind the brow of
the bank, Herr Winckel descended with
much puffing and blowing into the road.
woman in the nurse's garb had to take
long strides to keep up with it.
"That's civil of them, anyhow,"
thought Laura. "They think that I
have come a cropper and the nurse Is
bearing down with bandages and stick
ing-plaster."
A moment later she was up from her
knees, standing' in the middle of the
road in an attitude half .defiant, half
shrinking, and gazing with a strange
fascination at the oncoming. bath chair.
For from out of its hooded depths a
pair of eyes were glaring at her â fierce,
burning eyes which she had last seen
at Olgn Palitzln's side at the house In
the Hue St. Pol. If the gray beard was
there it was so hidden by mufflers as
to be invisible, but there was no mis
taking the eyes, and they In turn by a
swift .process of deduction aided Laura
to penetrate the disguise, of the nurse.
It was the Princess herself.
And then, suddenly, while Laura was
debating what Spencer would Avish her
to do, the chairmun, whom Hhe'dld not
recognize, turned the . vehicle, round,
and, pushing it now at a more decor
ous rate, wheeled it away In its orlgl
na.1 direction, while the nurse bent over
her patient and appeared to be tend
ing him. At the same time from the
bank above her Laura heard herself ac
costed In a voice that suggested chim
neys and portmanteaux;-^
"How do you do, Mees Medcalf? This
is a pleasure unexpected, -which I had
not to myself promised till later In the
afternoon. I am on my way to Blajr
geldie to see my friend Spencer For
de?cue."
"Billy" was behaving beautifully and
Laura was thoroughly enjoying her
spin through' the familiar country. The
lonely Highland road was practically
deserted, and it was not till she had
reached a point nearly opposite Birk
hall that on rounding an angle she saw
far ahead a man wheeling a bath
chair, at the. side of which walked a
hospital nurse. They were going In the
same direction as herselfâ away from
Ballater, toward Spttalâ and she had
therefore only a back view.
"I hope to goodness Deeside isn't go
ing to become a resort for Invalids,"
she thought, at the same time with
characteristic good nature ringing her
bell while she was yet some distance
off so as not to flurry the particular in
valid in question. And then as the
silvery tinkle died away two other
sounds followed in quick succession â
first the wheezy rush of escaping air.
secondly from Laura herself the hearty
exclamationâ '
"Confound it! I've got a puncture,
and a bad one."
She was off in an instant, kneeling
over the prostrate "Billy" by the road'
side, and a hasty examination showed
that both tires were pierced with neat
round holes of considerable j diameter,
and that to ride home was out of the
question. Hardly had she made the
discovery when looking down the road
she saw that the bath chair had been
turned and was being wheeled toward
her at a greatly increased rate of
speed â so fast, indeed, that' the
"Not that I^know of, but it might.be
as well if you # and I kept cur eyes
about us. The're's a certain responsi
bility, you see, as we are the. only ones
hereabouts who know the Palitzin
gang by sight, and it would be our duty
to apprise the local autnorltles if we
spotted any of them."
"Oh well. I don't think they'd come
here, with Ballater swarming with po
lice. Besides, it's too ridiculous. Rus
sian Nihilists on Deeside â where I've
lived all my life," said Laura, matter of
fact as ever despite her recent experi
ence, and firm in the average woman's
conviction that nothing out of the way
can happen amid everyday surround
ings.
Fortescue had the happy conscious
ness, however, that, coming from him,
the suggestion would not be altogether
disregarded, and he hoped that It
would serve till he could enter more
fully into the reasons for precaution.
In the meanwhile as, he watched
Laura and Fitz Harding ride slowly
down the drive he rejoiced that she had
a capable escort. For, his fifty-five
years and liver notwithstanding, the
ex-judge was still a man of thews and
sinews, and had been a noted tiger
slayer in his time.
But Fortescue's complacency was a
little premature. For an Anglo-Indian
with a liver dating back to the bad
old brandy-pawnee days there Is a foe
against whom muscle and nerve are
alike powerless. The day was one of
the few exceptions to the rule that
made September of 1896 a recor*d break
er In wet weather, and the fierce
autumn sun recalled Hyderabad to Mr.
Fiti! Harding before, they reached the
lodge gates of Blairgeldie. By the
time they were spinning through Bal
later, where loungers in tweed suits and
bowler hats suggested the Scotland
Yard detective at every step, it had
made his head ache. When they
reached the outskirts of the village it
had got him so sick and dizzy that he
Jumped from his machine with an in
voluntary exclamation of distress.
"I must offer you a thousand apolo
gies, Miss Metcalf, but I really cannot
go on," he said. "The sun has gripped
my battered o!d head in a vise, and I
shall enjy be an Incum^ranee to you.
If you will allow me I will turn back
and make for the ice-box in your
butler's pantry."
Laura with all sympathy urged him
to return at once, and turned "Billy"
for the purpose of accompanying him.
But against this Mr. Fitz Harding,
knowing of no reason to the contrary,
resolutely set his face. If she persisted
he should -sit by the roadside and not
go back at all. She had come out for a
good long spin, and of that spin nothing
should induce him to deprive her. It
was the riding he did not feel up to,
but ho was quite capable of walking his
bicycle quietly back to Blairgeldie.
Seeing that he was obdurate, Laura
took him at his word, and. after watch-
Ing l.im on his way for some distance,
remounted and struck Into the road
that rutos past Glen Mulck House and
Braichlle. Before golns far sh2 met one
of the tweed-coated loungers, who
looked sharply at her. as she sped by,
little guessing that the trim figure in
the serge bicycling "kit" had within
the fortnight stood face to face with
the living reasons of his Ueirrg there â
that In that dainty, well-poised head
was a knowledge of certain faces,
which, had he possessed it. might have
brought him fame and fortune.
She looked up at him not in the least
frightened, but knowing by his tone
that he had a reason for the question.
"Rather not! I should have put you
on to them sharp by wire if I had,"
she replied. "Is there anything wrong,
Spencer?"
"You haven't seen any of our friends
of the Rue St Pol in. these parts, eh,
dear?" he asked her.
The prospect of taking his mechan
ical medicine in such pleasant com
pany was Irresistible, and Mr. Fitz
Harding readily assented. Fortescue,
who overheard something of the ar
rangement, l;nev.- that his private talk
with Laura would have to be post
poned, and as she was not going out
unaccompanied he saw no reason for
apprehension. But coming upon her
in the hall, as she was removing the
dust-cloth from the glittering "Hilly,"
he seized the chance of reassuring him
self.
"And as the neighborhood simply
recks of personages It is on the cards
that some of them may overflow
again to our side of the Glen," she con
cluded.
It was not till the gates of Blairgel
die were in sight that he dropped dis
jointed remarks on the local scenery,
and said suddenly:
"The lady vriend vor whom you make
so s much brave risk at Breslauâ it is
well with her and her betrothed?"
"Ye-e-es," replied Laura, surprised
into a rather halting assent. "They're
all right/thank you. Though it was
ypu who did all the real work that
night, Herr, and if you care about
gratitude my friend shall express it to
you in person. She is staying with us
for a few days."
. "Ach neln! but that is what I would
avoid. I Imblore of you, my dear Miss
Medcalf, my imblication in that busi
ness not to exbose," pleaded Herr
Winckel so earnestly, that he came ln|
fc-r a glance of keen scrutiny. His fair
companion's shaip wits were wondering
whether the subject had not been intro
duced for the purpose of. preferring
this request and if so by what means
he had become aware of Ilma's pres
ence at Blalrgeldie. However, she gave
the required . promiseâ subject to the
mental reservation that she would can- .
eel it If Spencer did not approve.
The carriage drive at Blairgeldie, as
it approached the castle, skirted the
tennis lawn, and a game was in prog
ress, with a goodly contingent of the
house-party looking on. At. the sight of
Laura's ignominous return a shout of
chaffing condolence went up. mingled
with en undertone of conjecture as to
who her odd-looking escort could be.
Fortescue, who had been worried and
anxious since Mr. Fitz Harding had
come back, breathed a sigh of relief,
and ran aerejs tha drive. .He had been
half expecting a visit from Volborth,
but somehow the arrival of the police
agent with Laura, in conjunction with
the plight of the bicycle, suggested that
tiist words had best be in
private.
"I've got 'Billy' punctured. Spencer,"
said Laura as he came up. "Andâwon

toward the front entrance leaving the

"Well, Paul?" Fortescue said, as
soon as she was beyond earshot.

"And I have to thank you for saving

suppressed emotion.

You are a man to be envied, Fortescue.

"Good God!" Fortescue exclaimed
under his breath.
"Yes, it is serious, and ycu will both

they are under the impression that you
and Miss Metcalf are the only wit
nesses who can identify them by sight
and by name. For the moment I should
imagine that you two are more the ob
ject of their presence here than even
their ultimate aim."
"I had an Inkling of this," Fortescue
said, and he briefly recounted his sus
picions that he had been followed in
London. Volborth listened with a grav
ity which his Teutonic disguise empha
sized into, a Beeming callousness, and
Fortescue was stung by It to a sudden
exasperation.
"Look here, Paul," he broke out.

Volborth gave an Ironical chuckle.
"It would be sufficient to insure the
conspirators going scot free," he re
plied. "Those are the gentry I am
striving to keep outside the affair, and,
oh! if you only knew the trouble I
have with them as it is. Would you

not last much longer."
"My suspense does -not matter, but
I will not have Laura sacrificedâ like
Lobanof," returned' Fortescue hotly,
and for the last time in his life he saw
the imperturbable . police agent visi
bly moved. A purple flush suffused
Volborth's face and he breathed heav

"Do hot strain our friendship by re

hoarsely. "That 2 was all different. I

greeting won no answering sign from
Herr Winckel, though after they; had
passed there was, perhaps, the faintest
trace of annoyance in his stolid coun
tenance. -
\ "But certainly, monsieur; I accept
your kind offer with gratitude," he re
plied. "I was trying to convey to this
worthy servitor that I bear a letter
from her Majesty the Empress*of Rus
sia, which I am commanded to deliver
in person to her Majesty's maid-of
honor â Mademoiselle Vassili â who is a
guest of Sir Metcalf."
Fortescue, with the privilege of a fu
ture l eon-ln-law, signed to a groom to
â¢take the horse to the stables. "I -will
myself conduct you to Mademoiselle
Vassili, monsieur," he said. "I left her
but a few minutes ago on the tennis
lawn." And turning to Volborth, he
said hurriedly in English, "Will you
wait?"/
"No," was the reply. "I only came to
warn you. If you take as much care of
yourself as will be taken of you by
others all will be well." And with a
clumsy bow that included Dubrowskl
and the servants the disguised police
agent turned and made his way back
along the drive.
Chatting on trifles, Fortescue led the
aide-de-camp through a maze of
flower-beds to the edge of the green
sward, where Il'ma, seated in a ham
mock-chair at Lady Metcalf's side,
made a conspicuous figure among the
group of spectators. The fact of Du
browskl being on duty relieved him of
some of the awkwardness of his posi
tion, and he marched up to lima with
a confidence lent by the imperial man
date,
"I bring you this, mademoiselle, from
her Majesty the Tsarina," he said,
proffering a letter which he took from
his sabretache. "I am commanded to
await your reply."
Though Lady Metcalf had never met
Dubrowski she knew him perfectly
well by sight, thanks to her post of
vantage r.t Breslau, and she wondered
why lima did not introduce her fiance.
Instead of doing so, however, formal
leave having been asked and given,
the mald-of-honor broke seal and ap
plied herself to the perusal of the let
ter. Dubrowskl had fallen back a few
paces, and though the observed of all
observers, was chatting with well-bred
ease to Fortescue. The latter, possess
ing the knack of attending to two af
fairs at once, watched lima as she
read, and he noticed a deep crimson
flush spreading over the fair young
face. She had not nearly finished when
she began to bite her lips with annoy
ance, and by the time she came to the
signature her brows were contracted
in a frown.
But for her there was no appeal from
the will of the writer, and quickly mas
tering herself she passed the letter to
her hostess.
"This concerns you, dear Lady Met
calf," she said, forcing a smile. "It
really rests with you to answer her
Majesty."
Lady Metcalf adjusted her gold
pince-nez, and commenced a brave
struggle with; the Imperial French.
Fortescue, still assimilating all that
occurred, observed that upon - this
reader the letter had an exactly oppo-
"I trust that what you consider my
jnlsguided zeal will gain its object. You
"will have no need to drag the young
idiot Into trouble now, surely?" For
tescue replied.
"You know our system," said Vol
borth; "There is no getting away
from that Breslau attempt. AVe make
no distinction between ignorant and en
lightened offenders. He has played
with edged tools, and when the day of
reckoning with those others comes he
will have to abide the consequences."
Further conversation on the topic was
impossible, for they were nearing the
hall door, where Boris Dubro-wski, al
ready dismounted, was vainly trying to
make the old Scotch butler understand
his best Parisian..
"He has not seen me like this; I am
Herr Winckel again," whispered Vol
borth. "Offer to Interpret for him."
"Pardon, monsieur, but perhaps you
will allow me to translate your -wishes,"
said Fortescue in French, raising his
hat as he advanced, and wondering if
Boris would remember their meeting
in the street at Breslau. But the Tsar's
aide-de-camp had been much too an
gry on that occasion to note strange
faces, and he returned the English
man's salute without a sign of recog
nition.
"Let us follow and see what has
brought Master Catspaw hither." said
Volborth, as soon as the aide-de-camp
had passed. "Ah, my friend.". he con
tinued, as they walked up the drive,
"there, now, in your lopping off of
that limb from my ramifications lies a
real cause of discord , between us,
were I. inclined to ciuarrel. It was
honest of you to tell me, though.
And in the cipher code and the de
scriptions of the Rue St. Pol folk you
more than made amends. Yes. after
all the balance of credit is still with
you.'" .
Fortescue smiled softly to himself
at the gentle reminder of the one in
stance in which his action had been
not quite eye to eye with that of his
former colleague. Volborth's inten
tion of putting that instance forward
as a claim lor present forbearance was
a little too obvious.

caused an interruption.

said Volborth, and they had hardly
got clear before the horseman rounded

JX college publications has not fallen
within the province of the book
reviewer in the past, the ambitious
character of some of. them makes
such notice imperative. Notable in
stances of such collegiate effort are
the "Blue and Gold" annual of the
class of 1905 at the University of Cali
fornia, and the '03 Stanford "Quad." If
size Is any merit the recently publish
ed class book at Berkeley must be ac
knowledged the peer of anything that
has come from the pens and pencils of
college editors and artists, for it has
the proportions of an atlas of the
world, though far more artistically
compiled and printed than the average
atlas. The "Blue and Gold" is not an
overgrown literary rutabaga, however;
its covers, though far apart, are cram
med with sense and nonsense of the
typical collegiate keenness. The ' '03
Stanford "Quad" goes In for quality
strictly. Not half the size of the
Berkeley annual, it outranks the "Blue
and Gold" conspicuously in point of lit
erary and artistic merit. The drawings
incorporated In the book are particu
larly fine. Editors and their staffs of
both publications deserve no scant
praise for their work.

J'APAN has always had an attrac
tion for artists and literary peo
ple and no land In the Orient has
been written up to a greater extent
than the land of the crysanthemum.
At present the war is attracting writ
ers in great numbers to Japan and
we may expect to be treated to a book
by each of them when they return
home; but should the new books make
as pleasant reading as "Japun â the
Place and People." by G. Waldo
Browne, they will be quite welcome.
Browne's work was first published
in 1901 and enjoyed such a share of
popularity that a n:?w edition was
called for and has just been published.
It is a large book of 438 pages, llnely
illustrated, many of the plates being
daintily colored. The preface, which
bears the signature of Kogoro Taka
hira. Minister for Japan at Washing
ton, briefly but tersely explains how
it happened that the Japanese made
in a brief period the change from a
condition resembling the medieval
barbarism of Europe to one of civÂ«
lllzation higher than that of the Rus
sian empire.
Browne i first escorts the reader
through all the chief districts of the
Japanese Islands, including the cities
and centers of commercial activity.
He fully describes the customs and
occupations of the people as circum
stances draw attention to them? He
then outlines, the home life and ar.
tistic aspirations of the Japanese. \ A
clear and entertaining sketch of the
history of the kingdom follows, with
numerous pretty folk-stories and re
ligious myths to round out the work.
The writer has a pleasing style and
exhibits an extensive knowledge of
Japan and the Japanese. The book
vrill undoubtedly prove Interesting to
all who desire to become better ac
quainted with the bright little people
who are so heroically contesting the
aggressions of the great empire of the
Czar.

H. Irvinir Hancock's book on Japan
ese "Jiu-jitsu" for women follows close
ly the lines of his first work on the
general aspect of this remarkable
muscle forming system of gymnastics.
The author claims that the course hÂ«
advocates, if followed conscientiously,
"will make a weak woman stronger,
and will make of any reasonably
strong woman one who is the physical
peer of any man of her size." This
latter assertion is a pretty strong one,
but upon reading Hancock's outline of
"Jiu-jitsu," modified to suit feminine
capabilities, one cannot but believe
that such a thing is quite possible. In
thl3 second work Hancock reviews in
brief what he had to say in his pre
vious books upon the basis of Japanese
physicial training and then proceeds
in detail to elaborate upon the modified
application of this training to women.
His book could well be used as a
text by any one desiring to make prac
tical test of the Japanese theory for
bodily upbuilding.

cannot be adopted, he believes that the

of this system Is given In a letter ad
dressed to the author by H. II. Crum,
Dispensary Commissioner of South
Carolina.' Speaking of the working of
this system In South Carolina, . Crum
testifies as follows: "The dispensary
system -has proven successful In our

changeable to suit the exigencies of the
story's action. Curtain discloses both
the sisters living in Paris, Anna by her
art, Annabel by her wits. Before long
the reader discovers that Annabel's
very Bohemian temperament has led
her into the ways that are rose strewn;
but in order to make a rich catch In
the matrimonial pond this faithless An
nabel throws the burden of her sins
on to sister Anna's shoulders by the

nabel lands the rich catch and files to
England and the seclusion of staid
married life, leaving Anna to fight out
the battle precipitated by the escapades
of her graceless sister.
Â¦ Herein lies" one of the glaring falla
cies of the story. The author does not
lead us to believe that the angel Anna
is possessed of a consuming love for
the Jezebel sister, yet he makes her
perform every sacrifice, undergo every
slurring Innuendo and open bullying
from the erstwhile, favorites of Anna
bel, come near starvation once and
near being murdered once, Just that
the graceless and undeserving, sister
may find and hold to the high paths
of virtue. -This, with the constant flit

the senseless hiding behind j curtains
and revolver brandlshingsQf the man

out the story he lights up the somber
background of the tragic v/lth quick
flashes of whimsical humor at-rhe ex
pense of the lovers, short and fat, in
Morris Lane, with a skin that burna
with infantile blushes at the least reg
ister of a love thought in his heart;
short and presumably chubby also Is
Betty Farnham, the little lady whose
eyes inspire those blushes, and she has
opinions. In the frolic with fate that
suddenly brings these two loving
hearts together, when they seemed to
be hemispheres apart, there is much
sprightly Interchange of convictions,
philosophic end otherwise. Mitchell
makes sly fun of his ardent lovers
even while humoring them.
The setting chosen for the story is
idyllic. A modern villa at Tivbli, built
eo exactly over the spot where Horace
and Maecenas were wont to disport
themselves In the rare old days of long
ago that ancient pillars support the
walls of the cellar, houses nearby the
entire .plot. With the drunken cherubs
and the -coldly classic statues in the
garden, the marble balustrades, hoary
with centuries, and the yellow stone of
the fountain basin Mitchell makes a
scene more perfect for what it suggests
than what it actually portrays. To
this setting of his the added flavor im
parted by the chosen words of Horace
heading every chapter and the delicate
decoration of classic frieze and carven
wine bowl that reinforces the text
makes for the heightening of the illus
ion. It seems as If the destinies of the
characters In "The Villa Claudia" were
locked in the grasp of ever present
wraiths from the past.

This amphora of rare Falernian
wine that had been buried by the jolly
old Latin poet for "lovers yet un
born." who may some day sip from
its golden heart "the joy of all im
aginings." is the veiled Sibyl of the
story about which cling all the mys
tery and all the delicious "frlS3onne
ment" of fear of the unknown. Per
haps a strict analysis of Mitchell's use
of this jug of old Tibur wine, whose
sweetness is Idiocy or death, will de
clare the artifice somewhat too exag
gerated to be convincing, but under
the woof of the stay, spun so artfully
about this same century crusted wine
jar, no incongruous line is visible. If
we read that a drink from Horace's
amphora may make of the one who
quaffs a senile shell of debauched de

are quite ready to take the author's
word for it, so closely does the story

J TNDER the 'title of "The North
f/star" Mrs. M. E. Henry-Ruffln
has written a fanciful tale of Vi
kings old that may commend Itself to
lovers of pure romance. The story
lacks somewhat in coherency and
smoothness of narrative, is choppy and
disjointed in parts, but contains
enough stirring adventure and shed
ding of good Norsk gore to appease the
appetite of the most clamorous thirster
after lore cf the heroic age. The au
thor's story follows the career of the
mythical King Olaf of Norway, one of
the big fighting men of the tenth cen
tury and titular saint of the early
northern church.. From winning the
hand of a good Irish queen at Dublin
through all the hero's long life of dar
ing and adventure the author carries
this Idealized Viking monarch until we
see him in his declining years, an an
chorite on the dreary deserts of Syria.
"Lucky in war, ' unlucky In love,"
seems to be the fate cf this.bewhis
kered son of Thor. for he loses several
wives through the unfortunate Inter-.
When the author started out on his
iriEEion of exposure he believed that
the people were being hoodwinked by
the political bosses and that they were
unaware of the nature of the crime
that was being: perpetrated against
them and against the name of good
government. He went to St. Louis first,
and acting on that supposition he re
vealed the secret springs of corruption
in- his article "Tweed Days at SL
Louis." It was after that that 'he
awoke to the realization of the fact
that the evil lay deeperâ that the peo
ple knew and ignored. Then he wrote
"The Shame of Minneapolis" and re
turned to St. Louis to prepare "The
Ehatnelessnes of St. Louis." Philadel
phia he found likewise "corrupt and
contented"; Plttsburg revealed itself a
passive victim of police and financial
corruption; Chicago showed the sparks
of resistance, and New York was the
Vest governed large city In -the United
States under Mayor Seth Low.
After the searching review of all this
sbameloEsness and corruption, Steffens
feels that if he has roused the pride
of the American people he has done his
work to avail. For if pride Is touched,
That this eo-called "big business
man" is only one of a stripe with the

man and woman in every walk of life

Bteffens sets forth in no uncertain man

has made us a nation of grafters on a
lengthy, graduated scaleâ grafters all,
from the least to the greatest When
this manifests Itself in government we
call It corruption.

,bÂ«ween glyptic art and painting. The
journalist does not amuse, he in
etructs; if he can so do in words that
are. live, quick, full of meaning and
well placed, he is a good Journalist.
"The Shame of the Cities" reveals
Steffens es a good journalist. He has
obtained the news and he has set it
jfurth in a style that spaps like the
Fpark In a dynamo. The facts are ail
.picked out with, true journalistic ap
preciation of news values and placed
so that .they strike the reader sudden
ly, completely. It is as if the author
were addressing you and emphasizing
.his statements by sharp blows on the
'table. "The Shame of the Cities"
could be studied with profit by those
â¢who would know what good "news
paper style" is. i
. 'In his very Introduction Steffens
quite stuns his reader with his vehe
mence c-r condemnation of American
politics. For our failures in self-gov
ernment "no one class is at fault, nor.
any one breed, nor any particular inter
est or group of interests. The misgov

â¢Democracy, belays, is impossible, and
corruption inevitable. Our people know
that -they are not getting good govern

fold the hands in philosophic resigna

'they lift. This Is strikingly blunt on
Stiffens' part; It Is likely to wound the

are designed for the girl with brawnâ
"Golf for Women," by Mrs. Charles T.
Stout, better known as Genevleve Heck
er, and H. Irving Hancock's book on
"Physical Training for Women by
Japanese Methods."
Mrs. Stout is certainly not presump
tuous in setting herself as an authority
upon golf; for two successive years she
held both the national and the metro
politan women's championships; she
has contested with skilled players from
England and demonstrated her mastery
of the game against nearly all of Amer
ica's crack women enthusiasts. Indeed.
It is the author's absorption In the
game and â¢ its fine points that neces
sarily leaves her books somewhat lack
ing in one respect. While devoting all
her knowledge to the exposition of how
drives should be made, what constitutes
a long and what a short game, and how
bunkers and hazards are taken, Mrs.
Stout does not permit herself any great
attention to the discussion of the phy
sical benefits of the game to women,
nor how the girl should regulate her
exercise so as to derive the greatest
benefits from It. She does compensate
for this in a large measure, however,
by warning her fellow aspirants for
golf honors against little failings in the
game, delightfully feminine, such as Im
patience, overeagerness and filghtlness.
A chapter on "Impressions of American
Golf," by Miss Rhona K. Adalr, Eng
lish and Irish champion, brings to a
close a book that is eminently prac
tical, both for the beginner and the
adept.

The rainy season was coming on
and there was unrest in the air. Noth
ing had occurred for weeks to disturb
the soul-killing monotony of daily
guard mount and drill. It is such an
existence that drives men to drink.
'The mess call had been sounded and
the men gathered about their mess
tins on the broad patio ground, pre
ferring the open air to the mess room.
As usual, they were Jollying one an
other, bandying names that would
have sent the blood of anger to the
cheeks of men who live gentle lives.
The sun was lowering into the fluffy
tops of a bamboo thicket beyond the
houses on the other side of the plaza.
"Where's Sparrow?" shouted Buck
Taylor. "Any of you fellows seen
him around since mornin'? Must be off
on one of his Jags."
"I saw the lopsided galoot down't
Acosta's shop, Euckin' out of a vino
flask," vounteered Rob, brother to
Buck.
"Wai,** commented the Callfomlan

"They don't Kka ye, cub," ha said,
affectionately, "'cause ye snore when
ye sleep an' y* don't look pretty, but
I'll stand by ye anyhow â that* s what"
The cat rose to a sitting posture and
looked patronizingly at his friend.
Then he seemed to wink a wink that
said plainly:
"Ef he keeps on growin* that way.**
commented a big California back
woodsman, "he won't be no cat â he'll
be a b'ar. When he gets big enough
about the body to fit them paws, It'll
be about the time I'd rather see him
take to the woods."
"That's so," admitted Buck Taylor,
a huge Tennesseean. "He's got to have
some virtues. Every critter born has.
He ain't handsome, he ain't useful, he
tint got no morals, 'cause If he hod
he wouldn't a' chummed up with you
when he did. So he's got one virtueâ
he's eelf-aupportin'."
"Blcesed if I know," he responded.
"Somebody what was too kindhearted
to drown it must have taken advan
tage of my state to get rid of it."
That was all the history there was
to Srmrrow's cat. When he came out
of the guardhouse it came with him,
and it grew bigger and uglier, and still
its paws were too big. Unlike most
kittens, it was clumsy and heavy, and
they called it the cat cub, and later
the cub. It spent the daytime curled
up on Sparrow's cot. and Its purr
filled the barrack room. At night it
disappeared, but regularly at dawn it
showed up again. The beast seemed
never hungry, and sometimes there
were red doU about Its Jowls, redder
even than Its red, scraggy fur.
â¢ "Blessed If I don't like him, after
all/* remarked Sparrow one day, as the
cub turned disdainfully from a piece
of tinned army salmon. "He don't like
our grub, so he gets out and hustles
fer aomethln' he does like. Thet's the
kind o' spirit I admire."
Sparrow's watery eyes looked down
at the bundle of scraggy fur rolling
playfully at his feet.
Spa.rro%v was taken up to San Ra
mon under guard, but they could not
get the red and yellow kitten away
from him. Where he had found the
animal nobody could guess, but young
as the small beast was, its mangy fur
and chewed looking ears gave it the
disreputable air of a fit companion to
Private Sparrow.
This time the captain said, "One
week in the guardhouse." It was a
light sentence and Sparrow took it
with a melancholy meekness.
"Where'd you hook on to the kit
ten ?" asked the sergeant of the guard.
"Looks big enough to be a full-grown
cat, only she's got cub paws. Where'd
you find him?"
On one of his periodical jamborees
Sparrow disappeared for three days.
Then they heard that he had been
found by a patrol down in Vigan, on
the coast. Uc was walking up the main
street when they discovered him,
swinging his right arm with an imagin
ary sabre in his hand, and yelling, at
the top of his lungs, a challenge to all
the insurgent armies then In Luzon to
come out and see what he could do
singh handed. A crowd of admiring
and awp-inspired native boys followed.
In his left arm, against his side, he
carried a kitten â a red and yellow
striped, bob-Uiiled kitten.
â¢* y OBODY will deny that Private
f\( George Sparrow was a drunken
I \l beast. Send a man to the Phil
\^ Ippints who has a natural taste
'for firewater and you send him to his
finish. Not that the Filipinos will
tench him drunkennessâ you never see
them drunkâ but they distill the juice
of the nipa palm and call it vino. They
only sip this beverage, but it is not
given that the descendants of the old
becr-drluking Saxons and Danes shall
tip. Not when the fighting blood of
their ancestors has been made hot
within them by a year's active war.
Thus It was that In those days, there
being no beer in San Ramon, the men
of Company C. which took and gar
risoned the town, drank vino, not from
thÂ»Â» thimblc-i-ized glasses of the natives,
bat from tumblers and cocoanut shells,
and the natives looked on in wonder
and said "malo." And the most in
tempfratc cf them all was George
Sparrow, who put his mouth straight
to the neck of the bottle, and could
empty a Quarter at one swallow.
This was the worst that could be
said of George Sparrow. When he let
drink al'.ne there was not a better sol
dier Dor a finer comrade In all the
army. He had a splendid record pre
'viouss to the company's coming to the
small mountain town of San Ramon,
and that was why the post commander
overlooked as much as he possibly
could.
A gun stock came down like a club".
There was a fierce yowl, a hiss, and
the creature shot up and out Into the
darkness. The men, quivering with
terror, carried In their fallen com
rades.
Then began the watch, with an occa

the darkness they heard Sparrow rav
ing, calling them all, from the captain
down, sons of things unclean, and he
challenged all men who wore blue or
khaki to mortal combat and said things
that made strong men shudder.
At about midnight the captain was
called down by the rattle of renewed
firing.
"Sparrow's gone," reported the first
lieutenant. "Made a breakâ shot Cor
poral Walcott badly â and got away In
the darkness." â¢
This was true. When daylight came
the belfry was empty, the door wide
open. The murderer had escaped,
leaving . three victims behind, two dead
and one wounded. Later In the day a
native came In and reported having
seen the fugitive making for the pass,
and evidently wounded, for his clothes
were bloody. Men who had trailed red
Indians failed to find Sparrowâ the
Jungle swallowed him upX
"My God! the cat! Kill Itâ it's his!"
Another yell, and they saw him level
his piece. The men broke for quarters,
but not before one had fallen almost
over the dead Tennesseean. Soon they
were opening: a fusillade on the belfry
tower, but the madman sheltered him
self skillfully. Darkness came on and
the shooting ceased.
The captain appeared and posted
guards at various points around tha
belfry, with orders not to fire unless
Sparrow tried to escape. Then he de
tailed four men to remove the dead.
They moved cautiously out Into the
patio. By the starlight they could see
the body' of Rob Taylor, even the dark
pool beside him.
"What's that?" gasped one of the
detail. r. v^
"Come on, ye white-blooded coy
otes!" he yelled. "Come on! I'll lick
the whole damned lot of ye! Sparrow's
W nameâ that's me, you snub-muz
zled carabaos. Let the whole damned
army come, an' I'll give It the only
scrap it's ever had In this blasted
country!"
Two men had jumped to the pros
trate figure of Rob Taylor. The rest
rose and stood in a dazed stupor, not
moving. The deed had been so sud
den that none realized its significance.
The first lieutenant came hurrying
across the plaza from headquarters.
"What's the row?" he shouted, as he
reached the still stupefied men. "Any
body been fooling with firecrackers?
What In the name of God does this
mean?" he was staring at the dead
man.
"Sparrow shot him, / sir," said the
first sergeant, saluting.
" A shout came from the top of the
belfry- It was Sparrow, his gun In
one hand, his other waving the am
munition belt.
But Sparrow went on unheeding,
until he had disappeared into the main
entrance to the barracks. >
â¢ "What's that cussed fool got Into his
head now?" growled the third ser
geant, sourly. "Run along, some one,
an' see't he doesn't fool with matches."
Rob Taylor rose and made for the
sleeping quarters. He had gdne half
way when Sparrow reappeared, this
time with an ammunition belt swung
over his arm and a Krag rifle In both
hands. As he saw Taylor coming to
ward him he raised the gun and shout
ed:
"Stand back, ye white-livered hoss
thief!"
Taylor still advanced, his hands
raised, palms outward.
"Stand!" yelled Sparrow. There
was a spurt of flame, a cough of
sparks, a sharp report, and Taylor
dropped to a kneeling posture, then on
all fours and finally rolled over on his
side. With a wild, exultant yell the
crazed homicide dashed down across
the patio to the solitary church belfry
that stood to the rear of the church.
The door was open; he dashed in and
slammed It to. r ';>'
"Go lay down, you i half-boiled lob
ster," came from the Montana cor
poral. "There's yer cat a* meowin* for
yeâ go pet it."
Sparrow turned and walked toward
quarters. His gait was "perfectly
steady.
"Come yere," shouted the Califor
nian. "Yere's yes carabao meat await
in' fer ye."
Sparrow seemed not to hear, but
stood turning doggedly by jerks, like
a bull teased by the picadors.
"Sparrow," commented Buck Tay
lor, with blase frankness, "ye look as
nasty as a dog-gonned hoss thief an'
mean enough to steal fleas from a dog.
Go lay down an* we'll bring you some
chow when ye look more pretty."
â¢'Fellers," said Sparrow, thickly.
"I've Just heard there's some goo
goos a-campin' up th' mountain, an'
I am a-coin' to bring 'em In in sets o 1
fours. Where's my Krag?"
The men could see the big, blue
shlrted figure come swinging across
the plaza, his campaign hat shoved
back from the handsome, red flushed
face. Sparrow came heavily up the
gravel walk, and his sandy mustache
drooped with sinister significance.
"Hello," he said, mc-ociiy, looking
darkly about among the groups of
eating men. "Did any of you brass
buttoned veterans have the decancy to
lay holt o' my rations?"
"Naw," "drawled the Californian,
shoving Sparrow's full mess tin be
hind him, "we jest reckoned you'd be
too full o' vino to go dog biscuit an*
carabao meat, so we jest naturally
hooked onto your whack for our
selves."
"Reckon that's him a comin' now,"
announced a Montana corporal, "an'
from the swing of his gait, I should
say he wasn't loaded mor'n . Jus'
enough to be nasty."
catâ why don't the critter go an' look
after him?" '
A black cavity In the rock; appeared
above the thick underbrush. They
rose cautiously and looked. At the
mouth of the cave sat a man, bending
over a small fire, giving *orth hardly
any smoke. Beside him crouched a
huge red and yellow cat. Its ears
pricked up. Its eyes toward the brush
In which the three men were hid.
"What's the matter. Cub?" said a
voice.
"Now," whispered the corporal, "up
at him."
The three men sprang: up and
dashed toward the cave mouth.
"Hands up, Sparrow, we've got yÂ»
dead to rights!" they shouted.
It was still two hours before dusk
when three men left the town and
struck the trail up the mountain â
three stalwart sons of pioneers, who
knew -a trail in a tropical Jungle as
well .as In an American forest. For
half an hour they pushed on In single
file, the Montanan leading, their
heavy army shoes as noiseless as the
barefoot tread of natives. Each man
had his Krag slung through the crook
of hl3 left arm, as hunters, not sol
diers, carry guns. Finally they reach
ed a ravine which led squarely Into
the mountain side. The foliage wai
bo thick that It hid the light abova.'
Ahead was solid rock.
"Yere's where I saw him," whis
pered the corporal. "There's a hole
straight ahead." '.
The corporal dropped beside Buck
Taylor and as he "spoke rapidly in a
low whisper the other's face turned
as white as his Â§ companion's. Then
there came a sharp snap of his jaw,
the two men rose and walked toward
the barracks. They met the Califor
nian on the veranda.
"I have. Buck, or something as bad.
I've got something to tell ye that'll
make you hair curl.; Listen!".
"What's up. Jack?" asked the man
from Tennessee.! "Look's thoughyou'd
seen the devil."
Over hi3 head on a limb appeared
a big creature and it had the body of
a tiger, but the head of a man. And
the head leered and grinned and
winked a huge green eye and from its
mouth protruded v long, yellow fangs.
Then the face changed and the cor
poral struggled v spasmodically , to
scream, for the face was the living
image of George Sparrow. With a
yell the soldier sat up. A reddish ob
ject shot from a lin(b to the ground â
a huge, gaunt cat, with a bird's wings
fluttering from its' whiskered jowls. It
bounded off into a thicket. In a sec
ond the corporal was after it, his re
volver drawn, ready for use. And the
thicket of tropical foliage closed over
him, too, as it had done with the cat.
Ten minutes passed, then twenty.
The corporal reappeared, his gun in
its holster, but his face white, his
colorless lips apart. His eyes were un
naturally brilliant. He quickly glided
down the trail toward the village Into
the first street,' into the plaza, across
to the barracks. He found Buck Tay
lor oiling his gun in the shade of the
belfry tower. _ . â¢ .
Seven weeks had passed since Spar
row's last jamboree, and the affair was
beginning to be dropped from daily
mess conversation, when one after
noon the Montana corporal took a
stroll out into the near-by jungle and
fell sleep under, a big mango tree and
he thought he dreamed a. strange
dream.
One day a pink-eyed, flaxen-haired
naturalist came up from Vigan with a
letter from General Young and a de
sire to study the country. It was he
who announced the startling fact that
he had discovered a new species of
panther, whose fur was red and yel
low. He offered a reward of 550 to
whosoever would bring him in a speci
men.^ Â¦ .
A reward was offered* for him, dead
or alive. A week later two native!
brought in an object in a sack and
collected the reward. Private Spar
row, of Company C, was officially re
ported dead.
Meanwhile, the cub had also disap
peared, and natives came In with stor
ies of seeing a wild beast in the jungle
that resembled a cat, but, was twice
that size, and It preyed on chickens
and ducks, and had even carried off a
young goat. Some said that the crea
ture was as large as a wolf, and as
the weeks .went by these stories be
came more numerous.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
CUB: THE STORY OF A CAT
6Next evening the strikers, through
some mysterious channel, got word that
the flier was expected. About 9 o'clock
a crowd of them began to gather round
the depot.
It was after 1 o'clock when No. 1
pulled in and the foreman of the
Omaha roundhouse swung down from
the locomotive cab. The strikers clus
tered around the engine like a swarm
of angry bees, *but that night, though
there was plenty of jeering, there was
no actual violence. When ther saw
Neighbor climb into the cab to take
the run west there was a sullen si
lence: ! Â¦
Next day a committee of strikers,
with Andy Cameron, very cavalier, at
their head, called on me.
"Mr. Reed," said ' he, officiously,
"we've come to notify you not to run
any more trains through here till
this strike's settled. The boys won't
stand It; that's alL" With that he
turned on his heel to leave with
his following.
"Hold on. Cameron." I replied,
raising my hand as I -'â¢spoke, "that's
not quite all. I suppo*3 you men
represent your grievance committee ?"
"Yes, sir."
"I happen to represent, in the su
perintendent's absence, the manage
ment of this road. I simply want
to say to you, and to your committee,
that I take my orders 'from the presi
dent and the general manager â not
from you nor anybody you represent.
That's all."
Every hour the bitterness increased.
We got a few trains through, but we
were terribly crippled. As for freight,
we made no pretense of moving it.
Trainloads of fruit and meat rotted in
the yards. Tha strikers grew more
turbulent daily. They beat our new
men and crippled our locomotives.
Then our troubles with the new men
were almost as bad. They burned
out our crown sheets, they got mixed
up on orders all the time. They ran
into open switches and into one an
other continually, and had us very
nearly crazy.
I kept tab on one of the new engineers
for a week. He began by backing into
a diner so hard that he smashed every
dish in the car, and ended by, running
into a siding a few days later and set
ting two tanks of oil on fire that burned
up a freight depot. I figured he cost us
$40,000 the week he ran.. Then he went
back selling windmills.
After this experience I was sitting in
my office one evening, when a youngish
fellow in a slouch hat opened the door
and stuck his head in.
"What do you want? " I growled.
"Are you Mr. Reed?"
"What do you want?"
'1 want to speak to Mr. Reed."
"Well, what is It?"
"Are you Mr. Reed?"
"Confound you, yes! What do you
want?"
"Me? I don't want anything. I'm
just asking, that's all."
His impudence staggered me so that
I took my feet off the desk.
"Heard you were looking for men,"
he added;
"No," J snapped. "I don't want any
men."
"Wouldn't be any show to get on an
engine, would there?"
A week earlier I should have risen
and fallen on his neck. But there had
been others.
"There's a show to get your head
broke," I suggested.
"I don't mind that, If I get my time."
"What do you know about running
an engine?"
"Run one three years."
"On a threshing machine?" â¢
"On the Philadelphis and Reading."
"Who eent you In here?"
"Just dropped In."
"Sit down."
I eyed him sharply as he dropped
into a chair.
"When did vou quit the Philadelphia
Â¦ and Reading?"
"About Bix Â«nonths ago." ,
I began to get interested. After a
few more questions I took him into the
superintendent's office. But- at the
door I thought It well to drop a hint
"Look here, my friend, if you're a
spy you'd better keep out of this. This
mar. would wring your neck as qulcK
as he'd suck an orange. See?"
"Let's tackle him, anyhow," replied
at flood and blood.
"You don't think much of this
etrtke. do you. Mr. Reed?" said Andy
to me one night
* "Don't think there's going to be
any, Andy."
He laughed knowingly.
â¢ m ""What actual grievance have the
*boys?" I asked.
. "The trouble's on the East End," he
â¢replied evasively. *
. "Is that any reason for calling a
thousand men out on this end?"
"If one goes out. they all go."
".Would you go out?**
"Would I? You bet!"
"A man with a home and a wife
ar/d a baby boy like yours ought to
have more Fonse."
Getting up to leave, he laughed
. again confidently. "That's all right.
*' V.'e'Il bring: you fellows to terms."
"ilnybe," I retorted as he closed
â¢ Ihe door. But I hadn't the slightest
idea they would begin the attempt
that night. I was at home and sound
asleep when the caller tapped on my
â¢â¢ window. I threw up the sash; It was
pouring rain and dark as a pocket.
"What is it. Barney? A wreck?"
. I exclaimed.
"Worse than that Everything's
. tied up."
"What do you teean?"
"The engineers have struck."
"Struck? What time Is It?"
"Half past 3. They went out at 3
o'clock."
Throwing on my clothes, I floun
dered behind Barney's lantern to the
depot The superintendent was al
ready In his office talking to the mas
ter mechanic.
Bulletins came in every few minutes
from various points announcing trains
tiedup. Before long we began to hear
from the East End. Chicago reported
ell engineers out; Omaha wired, no
trains moving. When the sun rose
that morr.lng our entire system, ex
tending through seven States and Ter
ritories, was absolt^ely paralyzed.
It was a.n astounding situation, but
one that must be met It meant either
â¢ ignominious surrender to the en
gineers or a fight to the death. For
our part, we had only to wait for or
ders. It was Just 6 o'clock when the
chief train dispatcher, who was tap
â¢ piog at a key, said:
â¢ "Here's something from headquar
ters."
' We crowd*4 close around him. His
.pen flew ecross the clip; the message
was addressed to all division superin
tendents. It was short but at the end
of ft he wrote a name we rarely saw In
'our office. It was that of the railroad
magnate we knew as "the old man,"
the president of the system, and his
words were few:
"Move the trains."
. â¢Â¦"Move the trains," repeated the eu
. perintendent. "Yes, but trains can't be
. xroved by pinchbars nor by main
torce."
We spent the day arguing with the
..strikers. They were friendly, but firm.
Persuasion, entreaties, threats we ex
Â¦ hjuisted, and ended just where we be
gan, except that we had lost our tem
- pt-rs. The sun set without the turn of a
wheel. The victory of the first day was
certainly with the strikers.
Next day it looked pretty blue around
â¢ the depot. Not a car was moved; the
â¢ engineers and firemen were a unit.
â¢ "But the wires sung hard all that day
and all that night. Just before mid
â¢ -night Cbicago vdred that No. 1 â our
h!g passenger train, the Denver flierâ,
' had started out on time, with the su
. .#erintendent of motive power as en
gineer and a wiper for fireman. The
â¢message came from the second vice
president He promised to deliver the
train to our division on time the next
ei-ening, and he asked. "Can you get it
tfcrough to Denver?"
â¢ We looked at each other. At last all
eyes gravitated toward . Neighbor, our
piaster mechanic
â¢" The train dispatcher was waiting.
"What shall I say?" he asked.
â¢â¢ The division chief of the motive pow
er was a tremendously big Irishman,
â¢ with a voice like a fos horn. Without
. aalnstant's hesitation the answer came
Every one of us started. It was
throwing the gage of battle. Our word
had gone out; the division was pledged;
' the fight was on.
when Andy Cameron and Bat" Nichol
son sprang up into the cab I saw we
were in for trouble.
"Look hera, partner," exclaimed
Cameron, laying a heavy hand on Fo
ley's shoulder; '"you don't want to take
this train out do you? You wouldn't
beat honest workingmen ' out of a
job?" Â»
"I'm hot beating anybody out of a
job. If you want to take out this
train, take it out. If you don't, get
out of this cab."
Cameron was nonplused. Nichol
son, a surly brute, raised his fist men
acingly., Â¦
â¢"See here, boss," he growled, "we
won't stand for no scabs on this line."
. "Get out of this cab."
; "I'll promise you you'll never get
out of it alive, my buck, if you ever
get I Into It again," cried Cameron,
swinging down. Nicholson followed,
muttering angrily. I hoped we were
out of the scrape, but, to my con
sternation, Foley, picking up his oil
can, got right down and began filling
his cups without the least attention
to anybody.
Nicholson sprang on him like a
tiger. The onslaught .was so sudden'
that they had him under their feet in
a minute. I jumped down, and Ben,
â¢Buckley, the conductor, -came running
.up. Between us we gave the little
fellow a life. He squirmed out like a,
cat- and backed, instantly up against
the;tender.
.'"One at a time, and come . on," he
.cried hotly. "If It's ten to one, and oh
"a -man's back ; at that we'll do' It dif
ferent" it' With a quick, , peculiar 1
movement of his arm he drew a pistol, 1
and, pointing it squarely at Cameron,
;cried, "Get | back!" - Â» p; ., i%
" : ; I â¢: caught a flash of _ his \ eye \ through .
the blood that streamed down his face. -;
I wouldn't have given a~ swltchkey for
the life of the man that crowded him
at that minute. But j just then Lan
caster came up and before the crowd
realized it we had Foley, protesting
train.
"Not with that car of butter. If
you hold that butter another week it
will climb a hill without any engine."
"Can you handle a passenger
train?"
"I cuess so." ; â¢
"i'm 'going to send you "west on No.
1 to-night"
"Then you'll have to give me a fire
man. . That guy, you sent out . last
night' is a llghtning : rod . peddler. The
dispatcher threw most of the coal." â¢
"I'll go with 1 you myself, Foley. I can
give you*"steam. ' Can^you' stand it to
double ib'ack : to-night ?"'
"I can stand it if you can."
When I "walked Into the roundhouse
In the evening: with" a pair of overalls
on Foley ;Y/as in the cab getting ready
for -the .run. v .Â»' ...
Neighbor . brought tne ' flier In from
the East- As soon , as he had uncou-,
pled and got out ofjthe way we back
ed'down with the '448. : It, was the
best engine we had- left and, luckily
for my back, an easy steamer. Just
as we coupled to the mail . car . a
crowd of strikers swarmed out of the
dusk. They were in an ugly mood and
the fellow, eying me coolly.
1 introduced him to Mr. Lancaster,
and left them together. Pretty soon
the superintendent came into my office.
"What do yoju make of him. Reed?"
said he.
"What do you make of him?"
Lancaster studied a minute.
"Take him over to the roundhouse
and see what he knows." #
I walked over with the new find,
chatting warily. When we reached a
live engine I told him to look it over.
He threw off his coat, picked up a
piece of waste and swung into the cab.
"Run her out to the switch," said I,
stepping up myself. ft
He pinched the throttle and we
steamed Blowlv out of the house. A
minute showed he was at home on an
engine.
"Can you handle It?" I asked, as he
shut off after backing down to the
roundhouse.
"You use soft coal," he replied, try-
Ing the injector. Tm used to hard.
This injector is new to me. Guess I
can work it, though." â¢
"What did you say your name was?"
.."I didn't say."
"What is it?" X asked, curtly.
"Foley." . ,
â¢'_ "Well, Foley, if you have as much
sense as you have' gall you ought to
get along. If , you act straight, you'll
never want a job again as long as you
live. If you don't, you "won't want to
live very long."
"Got any tobacco?" .
"Here, Baxter," said I, turning- to
the roundhouse foreman, "this is Foley.
Give him a chew and mark him up to
He reached for the whistle and gave
the long, warning screams. I set the
bell-ringer and stooped to open the fur
nace door to cool the fire, whenâ chug!
I "flew up against the water gauges
like a coupling pin. The monster engine
reared up on her head. Scrambling to
my feet, I saw the new man clutching
the air lever with both hands, and
every wheel on the train was screech
ing. I jumped to his side and looked
over his shoulder. On the crossing
just ahead a big white horse, dragging
a buggy, plunged and reared frantic
ally. Standing on the buggy seat a
baby boy clung bewildered to the lazy
back; not another soul In sight All at
once the horse swerved sharply back;
the buggy lurched half over; the lines
seemed to be caught around one wheel.
The little fellow clung on; but the crazy
horse, instead of running, began a
hornpipe right between the deadly rails.
I looked at Foley in despair. From
the monstrous quivering leaps of the
great engine, I knew the drivers were
in the clutch of the mighty air brake;
but the resistless momentum of the
train was none the less .sweeping us
down at deadly speed on the baby. Be
tween the two tremendous forces the
locomotive shivered like a gigantic
beast I shrank back In horror; but the
little man at 'the throttle, throwing the
last ounce, of air on the burning wheels,
leaped from his box with a face trans
figured.
"Take her!" he cried, and, never
shifting his eyes from the cut he shot'
out through -his open -window and
darted like a cat along the running
board to the front
Not a hundred feet separated us
from the crossing. I could see the"
baby's curls blowing in the wind. The
horse suddenly leaped from across the
track to : the side of it; that left the
buggy, quartering with the . rails, but
not 1 twelve Inches clear. Â¦ The way thef
-wheels were cramped a single step
ahead would throw the hind wheels
[ into the train : : a step backward
would shove the front wheels Into It
It was appalling. '
Foley, clinging with one hand In a
headlight bracket dropped down on
the steamchest and swung far out As
the cow-catcher shot past Foley's long
arm dipped into the buggy like the
angrily, back in the cab again.
"For heaven's sake, pull out of this
before there's bloodshed, Foley," I
cried, and, nodding to Buckley, Foley
opened the chocker.
It was a night run and a new track
to him. I tried to fire and pilot both,
but after Foley suggested once or
twice that if I would tend to the coal
he would tend to the curves, I let him
find them and he found them all,
I thought, before we got to Athens.
He took big chances in his running,
but there was a superb confidence in
his bursts of sneed which marked the
Â¦fast runner and the experienced one.
â¢ At Athens we had barely two hours
to rest before doubling back. I was
never tired in my life till I struck the
pillow that night, but before I got it
warm the caller routed me out again.
The east-bound flier was on time, or
nearly so, and when I got Into the cab
foÂ» the run back Foley was just coup
ling oh.
"Did' you get a nap?" I asked as we
pulled out.
"No; we slipped an eccentric coming
up and I've been under the engine ever
since. Say, she's a bird, isn't she? She's
all right. I couldn't run her coming up,
but I've touched up her valve motion a
bit, and I'll get acquainted on her as
soon as it's daylight."
"Don't mind getting action on my
account Foley. I'm shy on, life insur
ance."
He laughed.
"Yftu're safe with me. I never killed
man, woman or child in my life. When
I do, I quit the cab. Give her plenty of
diamonds. If you please," he added,
letting her out full.
Day broke ahead, and between
breaths I caught the glory of a sunrise
on the plains from a locomotive cab
window. When the smoke of the Mc-
Cloud shops stained the horizon, re
membering the ugly threats of the
strikers, I left my seat to speak to
.Foley.
"I think you'd better swing oft when
you slow up for the yards and cut
across to the roundhouse," I cried, get
ting close to his ear, for we were on
terrific speed. "In that way you won't
run into Cameron and his crowd at the
depot," I added. "I can stop her all
right."
He didn't take his eyes off the track.
"I'll take the train to the platform,"
said he.
"Isn't that * crossing cut ahead?"
he added, suddenly, as we swung
round a fill west of town.
"Yes, and a bad one."
"Then you know what this means,"
said Andy, huskily, putting out his
hand to Foley. , He gripped the little
man's fist hard, and, turning, walked
away through the crowd.
Somehow it put a damper on .thÂ»
boys. Bat Nicholson was about the
only man left who looked as if he
wanted to eat somebody, and Foley,
slinging his blouse over his shoulder,
walked up to Bat and tapped him on
the shoulder. ' '
"Stranger," " said he, gently, "could
you oblige me with a chew of tobacco?"
Bat glared at him an Instant, brut
Foley's nerve won.
Flushing a bit, Bat stuck his hand
into his pocket; took it out; felt hur
riedly in the other pocket, and, with
some confusion, acknowledged he was
short" Felix Kennedy intervened with
a slab -and the- three men fell at once
to talking about the accident
A long time afterward some- of tha
striking engineers were taken back,
but none of those who had been guilty
of actual violence. This barred Andy
Cameron! who, though not worse than
many others, had been leas prudent;
and while we all felt sorry for him
after 'the other boys had gone to work.
Lancaster repeatedly and positively re
fused to reinstate him.
Several times, though. I saw Foley
and Cameron In confab, and one day
up came Foley to the superintendent's
office, leading little Andy, in his over
alls, by the hand. They ' went Into
Lancaster's* office together, and the
door was shut a long time.
When they came out little Andy had
a piece of paper in hia hand. "Hang on
to it' son," cautioned Foley; "but you
can show It to Mr. Reed If you want
to."; . /.v-
The youngster, handed me the paper.
It was an order' directing Andrew
Cameron to report to the master" me
chanic for service in the morning.
I happened over at the roundhouse
one day nearly a year later, when
Foley was showing Cameron a new
engine, Just in from the East The
two men were become great cronies;
that day they fell to talking over the
strike. ,
"There was never but one thing I
really laid up against this man," said
Cameron* to me.
"What's that? 1 *" *
"Why, the way you shoved that pis
tol into mv face the first night" you
took out No. 1."
. "I never shoved any pistol Into your
face." So saying. 'he stuck his hand
Into hl3 pocket with the Identical mo
tion he used the night of the strike.
and leveled at Andy, just a3 he had
done â a plug of tobacco. "That's all
I ever pulled on you, son; I never car
ried a pistol in my life."
Cameron looked at him, then he
turned to me, with aÂ«tired expression:
"I've seen a good many men, with
a good many kinds of nerve, but . I'll
be splintered If I ever saw any. 'one
with all kinds of r.erve till I struck
Foley.**
"Mate," he stammered, "you've been
through a strike 1 yourselfâ you know
what it nreana, don't you? But if
you've Â«ot a baby â " he gripped the
boy tighter to his shoulder.
"I have, partner; three of 'em."
The sweat stood out on the. biff en
gineer's forehead like dew. I told the
story. Cameron tried to speak, but he
tried again and again before he could
find his voice.
The instant the youngster caught
sight of his parent he set up a yell.
Foley, laughing, passed him Into his
astonished father's arms before the lat
ter could say a word. Just .{hen a boy,
running and squeezing through the
crowd, cried to Cameron that his horse
had run away from the hou3e with the
baby in the buggy, and that Mrs. Cam
eron was having a fit
Cameron stood like one daft, and the
boy, catching sight, of the baby that
instant, panted and stared in an idiotic
state.
"Andy," said I, getting down and
laying a han,d on his shoulder, "if these
fellows wane to kill this man, let them
do it alone â you'd better keep out. Only
this minute he has. saved your boy's
in-. . Â¦
In fact, mighty glad, as Foley ex
pressed it, when we pulled up at the
depot, and I saw Andy Cameron, with
a wicked look, pushing to the front
through the threatening crowd. With
an ugly growl he made for Foley.
"I've got business with you â youâ "
"I've trot a little with you. son." re
torted Foley. stepping leisurely down
from the cab. "I struck a buggy back
here at the first cut, and I hear it was
yours."
Cameron's eyes began to bulge. "I
guess the outfit's, damaged some â all
but the boy. Here, kid." he added,
turning for me to hand him the-child,
"here's your dad."
Thinking he would take the engine
again, I tried to take the baby. Tako
it? Well, I think not.
."Hi! there, buster!" shouted the
little engineer. wildly, "that's a cork
ing pair of breeches on you. son. I
caught the kid right by the seat of the
pants," he called 6ver to ma, laughing
hysterically. "Heavens', little man,
I wouldn't have struck you for all tho
gold In Alaska. I've got a chunk of
a boy in Reading as much like him as
a twin brother. What were you do
ing all alone in that buggy? Whose
kid do you suppose it is? What's your
name, son 7"
At this question I looked at tho
child again â and I started. I had
certainly seen him before; and, had
I not his father's features were too
well stamped on the childish facÂ« for
me to be mistaken.*
"Foley." I cried, all amaze, "that's
Cameron's boyâ little Andy!"
He tossed the baby higher; hÂ«
looked tho happier: he shouted the
louder.
"The deuce it is! Well, ron, I'm
mighty glad of It" ; And I certainly
was glad.

How to Get* a Job.
TO-DAY Is celebrated the third of
the great festivals of the eccle
siastical year of which Christ
mas and Easter are the other
two. Like Easter, Pentecost, or Whit
sunday, has a place In both the Jewish
and Christian calendars. For the for
mer It was the harvest festival.-" and
one of the principal ceremonies of the
day was the offering of loaves of bar
ley bread made from the first of th<
crop just harvested. These loaves were
made with great care, the flour hav
ing been sifted twelve times. Cach
loaf contained the tenth of an eplah.
or about three quarts and a pint of
flour, by our measure. The loaves were
each seven hands In length, four in
breadth, and the "horns" of the loaves
were seven fingers long. Those loaves
with two one-year-old lambs were
presented to the high priests, who
waved them before the altar, and a
number of lambs, rams, a bullock and
other animals were sacrificed at ths
same time. The bread was given, one
loaf to the higher clergy and the other
to the common priests, who at* it at
night, noting carefully that no crumbs
were left by the time when the morn
ing light appeared. These loaves, un
like the pascal bread, were leavened.
Besides the gathering of the harvest
the festival commemorated for tha
Jews the reception by Moses* on Mount
Sinai of the two tablets containing the
Ten Commandments, an event which
happened fifty days after the flight
from Egypt, or the events commemo
rated by the Passover of Easter. Con
sequently Pentecost comes fifty days
after Easter. The day was also called
the Festival of Weeks, because It cama
at the end of a season of special jubila
tion lasting a week of weeks. v
Under the Christian dispensation tho
festival celebrates the descent of the
Holy Ghost on the Apostles and Disci
ples. We are told in tho Acts that after
the ascension of Christ, which took
place forty days after Easter, his dis
ciples returned to Jerusalem and spent
the following ten days in prayer In the
Cenacle. At the end of that period
about the third hour, which corres
ponds to 9 o'clock of our time, a vio
lent wind was heard coming from
heaven, and on the heads of the 120
disciples In the room there descended
tongues of flame. Jerusalem was
crowded at. that time by persons from
all parts of the then known world, who
had come to witness, or take part. In
the religious ceremonies of the Jewish
festival; these persons w*:e attracted
by the noise of the wind to the Cena
cle and were there addressed by St.
Peter and the other Apostles, w iorÂ»
discourses were understood by all
(resent, as though they were spoken
in the manv native languages of the
hearers, although only one sermon was
being preached and that by the preach
ers in the language of Palestine. Aa
the church grew and increased In num
bers'and power the celebration of Pen
tecost became more elaborate and the
converts who. for any reason, had not
beea baptized at Eaater.' were baptized
then. Aa they wore white baptismal
robes, Pentecost also acquired the
name of Whitsunday or White-Sunday.
In the churches during the principal
mass and services a white dove, sym
bolical of the Holy Ghost, was sus
pended from the center of ' the celling
of the church, or a flock of doves were
let loose In the sacred edifice. A fan
fare â¢ on silver trumpets recalled the
rush of wind described In the Bible,
and little pieces of burning tow were
dropped on the congregations to re
call the tongues of fire referred "to In
the ScriDtures. The church, too,- was
elaborately decorated with evergreens
and wheat, barlev, etc.* to recall the
harvest celebration of the Jews. In
England Whitsunday is one of the
great holidays of the year, and is tha
occasion of an annual bank holiday.
pretty girl "who
takes a good pic

camera. She need not be a beauty.
But she must take a good photograph.
"I have one model- whose skin Is sal
low, her mouth Is thin and her figure
Is scraggly. But she takes a glorious
photograph. Her eyes light up won
derfully before the camera and she
can hold the expression well.
"Very few models are taken without
a little make-Up. The mouth is painted
with grease paint Into a Cupid's bow
and the lips are made a wonderful red.
The eyes are next lined with dark cir

"There are models who get $15 for
posing. They take a beautiful picture
and they understand their business.
They can command their own price.
"There Is Jane Holly, a model who is
rich in. her own right. She takes a
striking photograph and her wardrobe
is magnificent. We have one model
who will not pose for less than $20, but
she Is worth it. She comes to the stu
dio with a dress suit case full of fine
clothes. Her hair has been dressed by
a hairdresser and she' is groomed and
manicured to beat the band. She la
ready for a charming photograph. She
puts on a handsome gown and can pose

for an illustration to Â» story or for a
hair dresser's article. You see this
model knows her business.
"Aretha modtla intelligent as a rule?
Not very. They are clever but they
are Indifferent. They do as they are
told. But bo more. They seldom make
gnggorttons and they are too full of fun
to be In earnest. Still such models do
wake up once In a while and take an
Interest.
T "How many girls are posing as pro

pictures are not recognized In the news
papers and they go on posing -until
somebody drops oh. Then It is stopped
by the family. ;

nicest in the world!" â¢
In it let her take
heart. If her eyes
are fairly large
there is hope for
her. If she ha3 any

she is pretty sure
to be an acceptable
model. She can put
on hats for a milli
nery model. Or she
can wear necklaces
around her throat
for a Jeweler s
model. Or she can
put on fine gowns
for a fashion model.
"There are girls
of distinct type and
these find no trou
ble getting a job.
We have one model
who looks like an
Oriental. She poses
for cigarette adver
tisements. We have
another who Is de
cidedly Japanese In

Evelyn Ncsbitt is talked about a great
deal as the best model in the world.
Fhc has a beautiful face and beautiful
eyes. She is always taken for the head.
"On the other hand. Hiss Olive Cox,
the Burrte-Jones girl, is RTaceful. She
is the most graceful model that ever
stepped before a camera. We pose her
in long gowns and in costumes that re
quire a certain amount of chic and dar
ing. She never fails us.
"Of course a model* must be good
looking all around, though we have a
few who .are famous only for their
hands and their, feet There is a girl
whose :'gure Is short and fat and who
would never look well before the cam
era, but she has a wonderful little foot.
It is all arched and the ankle Is tiny,
while the leg is plump. She finds con
stant employment posing for the foot
and leg. And she does .not have to
ehow her leg above the calf either.
"Have I many on my waiting list?
Mo, indeed. They do not wait long, for
I bring them to New York almost Im
mediately. The trouble Is this. We
have use for a great many more models

is entirely different from the model of

rot matter how poor her complexion is
providing she has the right features to
photograph.
"A model who wants to work at the
business â and there is no reason why
every pretty girl who needs the money
should not be a model â must make up
her mind what she wants to do.
"If she wants to be a xrude model,
all right. She feels that her figure Is
her fortune. She can apply to the ar
tists and the sculptors and they will
give her work. But she Is not wanted
in the photographic studios.
"A few photographers want the nude
but no| many. They are the exception
to the rule. The great demand is for
pretty girls to pose in advertisements,
and for fashion Â¦ plates. In addition
to this they are needed for physical
culture poses, for ideal heads, for illus

Now is your chance, for the
professional model is In great de

"Miss Lester is one of the roly poly

the dimpled face of a child. Her Ideal

"At first the models did not like to
pose for advertlwflKttits, hut as high

they are quite willing to pose for the
best class of advertisements.
"Occasionally It will happen that a
photographer will Impose upon a model
and will tell her. that the picture Is for
one thing when it is -for another. But
this is not very often done. As a rule
the advertiser and the ~ photographer
will take the girl into their confidence

DEVELOPING MUSCLES OF
SHOULDERS AND BACK (M. F.)â
To properly develop the muscles of the
shoulders and back rhythmic exercises
are required â massage alone will not
bring about the desired results. First
of all, learn to stand correctly and
to do this practice before a mirror
until you are sure of yourself. Balance*
the body firmly on the balls of the feet
with the chest raised and the. abdomen
drawn in. After ajfew minutes of deep
breathing, which should always precede
and form a part of the exercise, you
are ready to begin the shoulder and
back movements. If you prefer to use
light wooden dumbbells do so, al
though they are not essential. Stand
erect with arms resting: lightly at the'
sides, palms against the legs and raise
the arms upward simultaneously.
When the arms have been raised to a
level with the shoulders, turn the
palms upward and continue to raise the
arms, bending them at the elbows,
bringing the closed hands, palms down
ward, over and â¢ six Inches above the
head. Then force the arms backward,
which will be tiresome at first because
the muscles are weak, but after a few
trials a feeling of elasticity will result
which will be most pleasant. Then
bring the-arms downward with elbows
still bent and the upper arm straight
out from the shoulder; continue to hold
the arms as far backward -as possible
while you are counting ten rather
slowly; then repeat from the beginning
of the exercise. The movement may
be continued for a half hour <?r until
tired. Do not overexerclse the muscles
at first If the muscles feel sore rub
thoroughly with equal parts of alcohol
and tincture of camphor. After you
have practiced for a week you will not
need this application. Always bear in
mind that if the arms are allowed to
successfully entertain your friends in
formally on Sunday I would" suggest
that you provide something more sub
stantial than the conventional tea and
wafers. These are all very well when
ladies only are present, but a big, broad
shouldered man never feels quite so
close to a "sissy" as he does 'when at
tempting to hold a fragile bit of china
and look unconcerned and happy while
nubbling a tiny . wafer. He may put
up a splendid bluff and vow serenely
that he is having the time of his life.
Of course he Is, the poor dear. Don't
all the men know it and does not a
clever woman catch the savage gleam
In his eye as the tiny cup careens and
is saved only by a bit of ungraceful
juggling? Depend upon it, deep down
in his heart he is longing for a big
cup of coffee and a sandwich of gener
ous proportions and doesn't care a rap
whether it is the proper thing at a tea
or not. .So if you would be a popular
hostess provide something which the
men can enjoy or the house will know
them no more! The refreshments
should not be of a character to spoil
a relish for dinner. Such dainty sand
wiches as chicken, cheese, minced
ham, nuts and whipped cream may
be varied by the admixture of finely
chopped parsley or a crisp lettuce leaf

ruptions to the sight, distracts the eyes
and compels the wearer to focus In dif
ferent directions. Though these direc
tions of focus differ ever so slightly, the
result Is injurious. Many a case of astig
matism has been traced to the baneful
effect of the dotted veil.
Next in importance to ths veil .Is the
parasol. One lined v.ith green silk should
always be used In a glaring light, Ilka
that at the seashore.
Many an eye Is seriously strained and
injured because the owner does not wish
to admit to herself or confess to the world
that youthful sight Is waning. Put on
glasses whenever they are needed. Their
function is to assist and save the eye. If
properly treated that organ will remain
efficient and useful until life's close.
An oculist, who speaks with authority,
says that a great many persons Injure
their eyesight by not keeping their glasses
bright and highly polished. They allow
dust and perspiration to accumulate upon
them and make them dim and semi-'
opaque, and the eyes are strained when
trying to look through them. An occa
sional washing in warm soapsuds or alco
hol is necessary.
Naturally following the care of the eyes
is the care of the eyebrows.
If they are brushed carefully every day
their appearance will be- much improved.
Always brush with an outer motion go
ing from the r6ots to the end. Brush
them occasionally with a camel's hair
brush dipped In cocoanut oil. This not
only makes the brows glossy, but causes
them to stow.
A good stimulating lotion, which aids
growth of eyebrows, is made of two
drams of olive oil, quarter dram of tinc
ture of enntharides and one ounce of
alcohol. Appiy this with a brush once a
week.
For eyebrows that have been burned off
an emollient made of half an ounce of gly
cerin and one ounce of olive oil is excel
lent. Sv.eet oil, with lime-water, should
be used on eyebrows that have been
freshly burned: or equal parts of lime
water and linseed oil.
Eyebrows repay all the care that can
be given to them, for if they are well
arched and glossy they add much to the
attractiveness of a face.
Too seawn rlcep Â«r.& too little sleep "axe
â¢ like Injurious to the eyes, the former de
bilitating them through tha prolonged in
action In which It keeps them, the latter
from fatigue. Then again, the sight may
be epoiled by using the eyes too little.
This is only a degree less harmful than
using- them too much.
Too strons a light and profound and
long continued darkness both predispose
the eye to various maladies, some of them
very serious. Sudden transitions from
darkness to llsht, and tha reverse, are
especially injurious.
The pupil of the eye expands In dark
ness, and. If It be suddenly exposed to a
bright light, contraction not taking place
readily, paralysis of the retina, with con
sequent blindness, may ensue. The sud
den transition from light to darkness Is
attended with less serious, but no less
certainly injurious consequences.
The reaction of the light on the sea
shore, or any brilliant surface, a predom
inance of glaring or of dark colors In the
rooms where much of the time is spent,
and looking lor.g at rapidly moving ob
jects are all injurious to the sight. Soft
to'.ors ere both most pleasing and most
beneficial to the eye. Green is the color
mcft fuvorable to the eye, as It exercises
the muscles moderately without fatiguing
them. Hiaol; or very dark colors main
tain thÂ«.m in a state of inactivity.
Wiien you have nothing to doâ when
juu are just rottingâ close your eyes. As

work to a certain extent.

â¢great advantages of the typewriter Is
:hat H allows an erect position and taxes

In reading or writing, the light should
come obliquely frcm the side and fall
upon the surface of the paper, so as to
Illumine it fully, with the reflection pass
ing away at an angle nnd without strik
ing the reader in the face. sinco the re

Let the eye* rest as toon as they begin
to feel weary.
An eye bath Is a daily necessity. Few
people know how good a cold water bath
is for the eyes. But it should not be with
a epor.ee and cold water, for this of ne
cessity Is done with the lids closed. It Is
much better for thÂ© eyes to be open in
cold water. This can be done by filling
a basin with water, putting the face In,
and opening the eyes once or twice.
As this Is not always convenient, as
the hair Is opt to get wet at the same
time, get an eye cup at a chemist's, nil
It with clear, cold water, and open and
â¢hut the eye two or three times in It.
Clear water should be used for each eye.
A little witch baxel or boraclc acid may
bÂ» eÂ£Â£ed to the water. Warm water is
good to use occasionally, although Its con
tinued use tends to redden the eyes and
make them watery.
The eyes should always be washed be
fore going to bed. to remove the dust
Â¦which may have gathered on the lids dur
ing the day.
To preserve the round shape of the eye
balls, occasionally rub them gently, al
ways toward the nose. As one grows
older, the eyeballs have a, tendency to
become sat.
"When the eyes have become Irritated
through excessive use. a compress of
linen, wet with cold water end changed
as often as It becomes warm, will gener

If the Irritation continues, use a lotion

leaves in a pint of distilled water, for
twenty-four hours. Then strain and add
â¢ n equal quantity of rosewater and the
saxne amount of brandy.
As automobiles became popular diseases
ef the eye began to Increase. Despite the

causes serious inflammation. The best
treatment Is a bath of clear water con

Among the patients of oculists the wom
en outnumber the men. Regarding this
fact twelve leading oculists have been
consulted, and they lay It to the wearing
of veils. i: - y. : i
Woroen who do not wear veils are less
troubled with defects of the eyesight than
these who always do so. And yet most
women may look forth upon the world
through veils without serious injury if
they will only wear veils of the right sort.
Most eye specialists disapprove of the
dotted veil, but they have nothing to say
against those of Illusion or chiffon, which
has a fine, even, regular mesh, through
which the eye may look without suffer
tne but worse results than come from
peering through the finest wire window

To what extent should we conform
to the opinions of others? How fa*
should we modify our beliefs and
practices because of tha fear of
what others may say or think?
Here comes along the thorough-going
Independent, who boldly declares that
he does not care a button for any ona
else, that he knows perfectly well what
suits himself and that he proposes to
go ahead on that line. But ths timid
conservative dares not take a slngla
step until he has found out what his
family, his friends, his neighbors or
the community think about it, and If
they hold up their hands in holy hor
ror at the proposition he will have nona
of It himself. Between these two ex
tremes is there any safe and desirable
middle ground?
If you must be one or the other,
choose the position of tha Independent
by all means. You have but one lifo to
live and you are the person responsible
for It. You know, or you ought to
know, yourself better than any one elsa
Jcnows you. You first of all will reap
the advantage or suffer the damage
arising from your forward step. Tha
moment you pass over to soma indi
vidual or to public opinion generally
the making of your decisions, the shap
ing of your actions, you abdicate tha
sovereignty which God entrusted you
with when he made you a man. You
become a weather vane, subject to all
the fluctuations of popular dictates and
whims. No slave is more abject than
that one who is continually In terror
lest he should offend popular tastes.
Moreover, no one ever makes any
headway with his life until he is ready
to brave and even go contrary to pub
lic opinion, provided he has made up
his own m^nd after due deliberation,
that his course is correct. The man
who first carried an umbrella on tha
streets of London was a laughing stock
to all who saw him, but he kept dry
while others got wet and he may hava
lived to see the day when the man
who failed to carry an umbrella was
the laughing stock of his fellows. Ho
who Is sure of his position can calmly
wait until the world comes up to it.
Nevertheless, one should not be so
wise in his own conceit as to pay no
heed to what people say. That con
sideration may be a valuable guide in
the right path and a powerful deter
rent from evil. The accumulated wis
dom of the world is not to be lightly
set one sldtf. In all civilized communi
ties a body of opinion touching man
ners and morals has been siowiy form-
Ing through the decades until it is now
crystallized Into a written or .unwrit
ten code with which it pays for a man
to be familiar and which he ought riot
to defy flippantly. It is perfectly In
order for a man to walk down tha
street on a spring rr.ornins in his dress
ing gown and slippers. He has a
right so to do. But most men prefer
to array trjemselvea in clothing of a
more conventional and generally ac
cepted pattern for a public thorough
fare.
American parents as a rule prefer
that their young daughters should be
properly attended when they go Into
society or off for a holiday, and the
girl who In her association with young
men Is governed by certain wise re
strictions not only maintains her own
dignity best, but is in the long run
better respected and liked by the men.
A wholesome fear of what people will
say may lead many a person into
paths of sobriety and decency who
might be too weak willed to go there
from the promptings of his o*n nature.
For people do not always say unkind
and foolish things. The average sense
of a respectable community Is to be
respected and, other things being
equal, I want the approval of my fel
low men.
Courage to work out your own prob
lems to a finish and readiness to listen
for and receive the wisdom of others
make the proper blend. To our own
selves we must first of all be true, but
that does not mean necessarily that we
should be indifferent or superior to our
fellowmen. Emerson hits It about
right when he says, "It is easy in the
world to live after the world's opin
ion. It Is easy In solitude to live after
one's own. But the great man is ha
who in the midst of the crowd keeps
with perfect sfcveetnesa tne independ
ence of solitude."
All this has a direct bearing upon
the matter of religion. For most of us
the midway position Is safe there. We
must get our own thought of God, of
Christ, cf duty, of immortality, but
why should we throw to the winds all
the conclusions wrought out slowly,
painfully, by those who have cone be
fore us? We need not conform our
beliefs In every particular to them.
On the other hand, we should not dis
dain this precious inheritance of faith
and hope upon which we may build
our tempi* and dwell securely therein.

THE NEWEST TAFFETAS- (Olga).
Water-proof taffetas, or cravenetted, as
they' are sometimes called, are the
newest imported silks designed espe
cially for the shirt waist suit which will
be as ; popular â¢ In Â¦ town Â¦ as at sum
mer resorts the coming season. From
point of beauty and utility this silk
Is a decided triumph of the manufac
turer's art. It is wonderfujjy-soft, con
forming : to ", the prevailing modes, and
so practical that the most exacting
cannot find fault. Moire effects are nu
merous among the choice samples, al
though small pinhead dots, checks and
fine Btrlped patterns predominate. The
full scale of blues figured with white
are presented and also many lovely
greens, browns, gray and black, all
more or less broken with white. The
smartesf suits have a short skirt, either
side or box plaited, tailor finished, or
a plain gored skirt trimmed about the
foot with 'stitched bands of taffeta.
The very newest decoration consists of
milliner's folds set on in. graceful
scrolls to simulate braid. The folds are
made of plain silk to match the prevail
ing color of the figured silk from which
the gown is made. Small buttons of
silk or gilt are used for fastening and
ornamenting the waist and skirt.
"REMOVING FACIAL LINES (Elsie).
The deep, drooping lines which run
from the nose. to the chin are the hard
est of all wrinkles to eradicate, espe
cially if they are largely hereditary,
as is often the case; then, it is almost
impossible to remove them Â« entirely.

THE WOMAN WHO FUSSES (L. N.

most tiresome creatures on earth. She
has little or no time for enjoyment and
not a moment to spare In cultivating
that thin, high-pitched voice which
penetrates the quiet with some fussy
nervous exclamation or helpful (?) re
mark at most inopportune times. She
is certain .the room is too cool or too
warm or that you would better read
this or that book. Because she wears
flannels in June she Is sure you will
catch your death If you do not likewise.
She keeps up this running fire of ad
vice and fuss until her friends vote
her a nuisance. She is far too busy
worrying over the world In general to
attend to her own affairs, so her chil
dren run wild and her husband is glad
to slip out of the house for a rest. Poor
soul! She has her bitter moments and
wonders vaguely why her efforts are
not appreciated and why men and
women shun her company. Somehow
she has a perverted Idea of life and
cannoÂ£ or will not see her faults. I
would *hot advise you to attempt the
task of changing such a disposition in
another, for you will but make an
enemy. Treat your friend kindly, don't
argue with her and when the trial be
comes too great escape as gracefully
as you can.

with the editors reaching out to the ut
termost corners of the world not only
dsco alone there axe forty-five car
riers, who in turn employ a small
army of 200 lieutenants to assist them,
and whose combined investment in
their routes Is over $250,000. That is
extraordinary In Itself. A quarter of a
million of capital being used solely
in the distribution of a great modern
newspaper in one city alone.
This does not take into account Ala
meda, Oakland. Berkeley, Sacramento.
Stockton, Santa Rosa, Fresno, Los An
geles or any of the other cities and
towns up and down the coast and thÂ«
Pacific States generally, though The
Sunday Call is essentially a home pa
per, devoted to home industries, to the
development of the vast territory of
California in particular and the West
In general, and it is in California that
it has its greatest sphere of influence,
both with Its news and its popular ad
vertising.
In Alameda, Oakland and Berkeley
there are fifteen carriers, who in turn
employ 100 assistants and whose indi
vidual routes are valued at over $7000
each. Stockton has twelve carriers,
Sacramento seventeen and Los Angeles
twenty. Thus it may be seen that the
work of distributing The Call is a
business In itself and a very valuable
business at that.
As may readily be imagined from
the foregoing the scene around the
sidewalk elevators and other press
room entrances at the Call building
when the first papers begin to come
from the mailing-room is one of in
describable confusion to the un
initiated. There are hundreds of news
boys, largo ami small, darting in and
out among the long lino of small carts
backed up In a half circle on Market
and Third streets, and all being loaded
with feverish energy as fast as the big
bundles can be brought up from the
basement and stowed away. In a very
few minutes after the last of 'the news
boys have scattered in a mad race
through the streets, shouting their pe
culiar cries, the first of thoso forty-five
carts have begun to follow after until
they are as widely scattered as the
newsboys who have gono before.
Then, as fast as the city cart3 move
away to make room for wagons of a
larger build and greater capacity, the
Alameda editions are loaded. To sup
ply Alameda County alone specially
equipped express wagons are em
ployed. As shown in the photographs
on thia page, which were taken by
flashlight in the early dawn of a re
cent Sunday morning, each of these
wagons is piled several feet high with
stoutly tied and carefully wrapped
bundles, all for Oakland, Berkeley or
Alameda. Near by ether wagons are
being loaded simultaneously with the
Marin County edition, which must be
shipped at the same hour precisely,
and as soon as the last bundle has
been thrown into place there begins
a race to the Union-street wharf,
where two tuga are lying in wait every
morning.

produce the various baffling phe

Thus if the pitcher is Using an over

must leave the hand with the two fore
fingers turned well downward and the
thumb upward, the finger tips closing
over the seam of the ball to give it
that swift revolving fillip which causes

For a. drop ball the swing of the

distinguishing difference between the

readily understood by reference to the

that after following an almost straight

news, and with the circulation of the
paper growing greater and greater
every day, the limited time allowed
the carriers grows less and lsÂ«s. in
stead of more. No matter how favor
able the local news conditions and thÂ»

There arises daily a hundred and one

the paper promptly at that hour. But
no. matter what O12 conditions of
storm and stress, every paper musÂ»t he
delivered in Alameda-County and the
territory immediately adjacent thereto
at not later than half-past five in the
working districts and G o'clock in the
fashionable residence districts.
That means that each of the four
separcte sections of the paper have .to

four times, wrapped into bundles,
loaded on wagon3 and hauled to the
water front, unloaded there on the

The speed ball, on the other hand,
injures a different set of muscles alto
gether, for in this it is the muscle on
.top of the shoulder and the muscle
just under the shoulder blade that suf
fer the most.
The slow ball rarely, if ever, causes
any injury whatever.
Now,, the best way for the young
pitcher, and even for the seasoned ath-,
lete, to begin development at the open
ing of the season is to avoid throwing
too hard at the outset. The failure
to' observe this simple rule has ruined
more arms than any other cause. It
is best, after the long rest between.No
veniberl and April 1; to begin prac
ticing slowly and work up. For the
first five or six days it will be suffi
cient to merely lob the ballthe pitch
er's distance, which is ubout sixty
five feet. After that It will be time
enough to put more speed into the.de-;
livery and to besin to develop the con
trol. Even then for the first ten or
fifteen bailo It is better to merely lob
it until the a^rni has been thoroughly
limbered up, and then gradually in
crease the energy and the precision un
til the, necessary speed and control is
secured.
Always follow these practice hours
as well as ' actual play with careful
precaution against taking cold. While
the body Is in a state of perspiration
see that you aie properly clothed to
keep yourself warm, and that the
pitching arm, especial^ is well prb

this invariable rule you ere likely to
contract muscular rheumatism, which
is difficult to cuie Â»nd which may in
any event bar you from the pitcher's
slab for weeks if not for the whole
season.

how the, great sumday call
is delivered to you.
IN the last few weeks two excellent
ballplayers have suffered tempo
rary, if not permanent injury, by
overstraining the muscles of their
throwing arm in playing and by not
properly caring for the injured parts
afterward.
Less than three weeks ago Al Whit
â¢ flflge was retired from the pitcher's
box on the Oakland team because he
â¢was muscle bound and consequently
had lost all control over his pitching
â¢erm, which was as hard as a rock,
when it should have been supple and
pliablcT When he tried for speed it
pained him excrutiatingly.
This is one of the saddest con
. ditSons a pitcher's arm can get.
into, but it is to be hoped that with
. rest acd rare Whitridge will Boon
be a!.> to play again as well as he
ever did. ;'Â¦ -'â¢
At about the same time little "Jlm
â¢ my" Toman, Los Angeles' fast short
Â¦top, met with an equally painful ac
cident while playing Oakland. While
running In on a slow grounder which
â¢he had to scoop up and throw hard
from a bad position, he exerted too
mad) energyâ "'ovcrthrowed himself,"
as Jt is called in the vernacular of the
field, ard rprained the tendons of his
tirm at the elbow very badly. Since
then his throwing has been very weak
and' not at all up to his old form.
Such an Injury, i' neglected, may In
capacitate him for life. Certainly, he
cannot we his arm row without ex
treme pain.
Of course there are injuries which
cannot be avoided, but the two in
stances I ouotf above were not at all
â¢due to the exigencies of the game, but
rather to the carelessness of the play
ers themselves.
In the case of Whitridge let me ex
"jildn what happened and how the in
jury was brought about before show
ing the best methods by which strains
of this sor,t must be taken care of. For
â¢the benefit ot the uninitiated it will be
necessary to explain some of the se
xrets of the pitcher's art, how he makes
the Laming curves and drops and slow
l.alls which, when properly executed,
make un exciting game nothing more
than a skillful combination bztweea the
pitcher and catcher.
" First, no matter what eort of a ball
Is delivered, whether a curve, a speed
ball, a drop ball or a slow ball, the ball
Itself is always held in the same way.
In this there Is only one correct posi-
er's bos more or Ices winced. Then is
the time t 1 wait, get control of your
muscles and euady yourself gener
ally. â¢
Ar<3 whin pitching a game use your
head. Think, and think clearly. Watch
your catcher and always deliver the
kind of ball he signals for, because ten
chances U/ one he knows tin peculiar!*
ties of the batter better than you do.
If you differ with him. give him your
signal of dissent, a nod of the head,
cr whatever the prearranged signals
may be, and if he insists I have always
found it best to let him have his way.
When there are two men out and a
runner on third base deliver the ball
without the long swing or the body,
â¢jecauce it gives the runner too much
of an advantage In a start for the
home plate while you are going through
the gyrations of the usual prelude to a
delivery.
Now as to the care of the arm. be
surg to- have it massaged for at least
fifteen minutes before beginning to
play and, if possible, have It rubbed up
' a iittle between each inning if there
is any. tendency whatever toward sore
ness or stiffness. 2
Eut no matter whether this Is done
or not, the pitcher who falls to have
his arm massaged thoroughly and
skillfully after a hard gruelling game
will sooner c-r later have to pay the
penalty that poor Whitrldge is under
going now.
Having massaged the arms of over
four hundred different ball players
during the past five years I know some
thins of what I am writing in this
respect, or at least, may be presumed
to.
.Thus, in massaging the tendon
sprained by a curved ball I take the
injured lesion between the thumb and
first finger and holding the arm firmly
with the other hand work the tendon
umll all the swelling is removed by
the friction, trking care to keep the
thumb and finger moist with a little
oil or vaseline.
For an injury to the upper tendon
caused by throwing the drop ball, I
take it firmly in the first fingers and
-thumb of both hands and while the
arm rests securely upon the edge of a
table or equally solid stand, work the
tendon thoroughly through its entire
length until it has again resumed its
normal size and the arm feels supple
again.
For the back and shoulder muscles I
work them thoroughly with both hands
as shown in the picture herewith, and
this is the only nay that a player may
be developed and get through a season

13nights later at a court ball, seeing the
girl, Walters made haste to be . duly
presented in form.
"If I might be permitted to take you
around a bit.", he suggested, "it would
be a : great pleasure. Oh, may I, real
ly?" As the girl nodded. "Let's start
to-morrow." v^r.
Such was the beginning of their
friendship, and as the daya drifted into
spring there were little excursions up
the river to be made, lingerings on the
3ruhl Terrase listening to the band in
the garden on the other bank; long
hours spent in the galleries with pauses
before the SIstine Madonna or some
other treasure In that wonderful store
house of art. Then, suddenly one day
Mr. Hoffman awoke to the fact that
his daughter, although but 17, was no
longer a childA Realizing that this pro
longed companionship with, an earnest
young musician might prove dangerous
to one, if not to both, he took passage
back to America, and to-night he and

into the song all that the singer dared

with tears, the facile v tears of youth

hope rosily spans the years, then clasp

forget-me-nots, she fell asleep.

THE late spring afternoon sun
shine flooded gloriously Into the"
bare old studio, lighting the
dreamy, sensitive face â¢â¢ Â¦ of .. the
young man .who stood by the piano
pouring out his soul in melody. It flung
a golden aureole around the head of
the girl who, nearly lost In a big arm
chair, sat absorbed. .
"Adelaide, Adelaide," rang out the
notes of Beethoven's passionate love,
song, and the girl's eyes filled with
tears as the music swayed her young,
untried . nature. And how well Harry
Walters looked when he sang!
Her thoughts, uncontrolled, wandered
back to the day when they had first
met, many months before. Newly ar
rived In Dresden, she and her father
had driven out to.Potschapel to Inspect
the big china factory, but at her fath
er's request for some one to show them
about the big German in charge flung
up .his hands.
"Aber, I spik no Englisch," he be

The windows of Cliff Towers were
brilliant with lights. Strains of music
floated out to the watchers in the
street.- Mrs. Livingstone was "at
h0me," and Bellevue avenue "was
crowded with arriving guests and cu
rious spectators.
The band on the lawn began to play
"Wine, Women and Song," and the
beautiful Miss Hoffman stepped
through the long French windows
upon the terrace.
The shimmer' of moonlight on the
water was exquisite. What did it and
the music seem to recall. Ah, Dres

it was since she had thought of Dres
den! The man beside her started ap
prehensively.
"Are you cold? Shall I bring you a
wrap?" he asked. She assented.
She wished to be rid of' him to think

his happy, boyish, half-boastful talk
struggled Into her thoughts. ".Walt un

tiara crowned. But^she would throw
him some flowers in memory of the
little ring now crushed and broken,
with a faded spray of forget-me-nots,
far back in a drawer "of her desk.
For, a moment the girl's face showed
hard and cynical in the moonlight.
There was a stir within the house,
the prelude of a song came to her.
Then a rich tenor voice broke Into the
refrain "Adelaide, Adelaide." A fam
ous tenor was^ singing and the girl's
eyes dimmed. "Adelaide!" A step
sounded ' behind her. She turned to
see Renshaw, her lace scarf in his
hand. Something in his expression
warned the girl that the crisis which
she had : so long been evading could
be postponed no longer. Her decision
must be made. -- He was ypung, rich.
"One can never go back. But per
haps one can start afresh," she an

The morning was clear, hut cold, and
on the crowded ferryboat only two
people, a man and a woman, dared
brave the forward deck. The woman,
tall and dressed in black, showed lines
of suffering and self reliance In her
face and a great sweetness. The man,
wrapped in a heavy coat, was hum

he breathed and the woman, with a
sudden start, turned. Recognition
leaped to both pair of eyes.
"Millicent! Is It really you? How
I have searched for a trace of .you,"
he cried. "But at your former home,

DAY DREAMS
â¢By A.M. Davies Og'den
Dean was talking across the table
to Eleanor Lee, and she suddenly
classed Eleanor with irrigation and
other unpleasant topics. Next to Dean
was Mrs. Chadwick. Her gray curls
were Just visible beyond his brown
ones. She was congratulating him,
Rosemary knew. She had been in
Europe all summer and had only
heard of the betrothal a few days ago.
It seemed to Rosemary that she was
unnecessarily rapturous and voluble
on the subject.
"It is the sweetest time of your
life," she was saying. "The betrothal
hour when we laugh and love, and let
His quiet, courteous sarcasm was
maddening under the circumstances.
She resolved not to even speak to
him atain. Old Mr. Rathburn sat -at
her other hand and she devoted
self to him with earnest fervor. He
was Interested in a plan for the irri
gation of the great American desert,
by means of huge, spinning hose noz
zles to be operated from balloons.
"But you'll have to get the water
up there before you can get it down,"
objected Rosemary, anxiously, for the
seventh time. She knew that Dean
was smiling amusedly. "Unless you
attach it to the clouds."
'Mr. Rathburn was silent and she
felt withered by a sense of his dis
pleasure, and she hated the theory of
irrigation by balloons or any other
way.
She laughed softly and buried her
lips caressingly in the heart of a single
long stemmed La France rose that lay
lightly on her breast.
The last trailing gown was vanish
ing beyond the heavy velvet portieres
of the dining-room as she came down
stairs. Only one lone figure awaited
her coming in the' wide hall and she
wondered who it could be. Not Jack.
Mrs. Creighton did not approve of
Jack. In fact she had once called
him a cub. Mild, but irritatingâ to
Jack. The figure turned suddenly,
at the sound of her coming. It was
Dean himself. Half unconsciously she
hesitated, her head lifted a trifle high
er than usual, her lashes drooping ob
stinately over telltale eyes.
He was terribly grave and dignified.
"I am to have the pleasure of taking
you In, Mrs. Creighton said. She evi
dently does not know."
"I had no idea that you would be
here." She spoke 'indignantly. It was
almost impertinent of him, when only
last night she had told him she never
wished to even look at him again.
"I could hardly help myself, after
accepting the invitation a week ago.
We will probably meet in the same
places for some time, until the break
ing of the engagement is announced.
At present, people consider us indis
pensable to each other's happiness."
loving her? Even Dean had called
her the dearest girl in the world. It
was sweeÂ£ to remember that. Of
course, he had behaved intolerably
about Jack, but when a man is in
love
IT wa.s late when Rosemary ar
rived. The otiier guests were
rising and dinner had been an
nounced. She had barely time
to toss aside her furs and exchange a
few hurried words with Mrs. Creigh
ton.
There was one thing certain, she de
cided, after a glance at Helen and the
rest. They had not heard yet and
ahe was glad of an hour's respite.
After the scene with Dean last night,
followed by a solemn one in the morn-
Ing with her mother, and finally the
reproaches and condolences of four
younger sisters, each with her indi
vidual opinion on the fitness of the en
gagement, it waÂ» a relief to breathe
freely without fear of conversational
dissection of her case.
"Who is to take me in?" she asked,
at the foot of the stairs, but Helen
was already bowing and smiling to
another guest as ehe answered:
"You're always late, dear, aren't
you? No excuse, though, please.
Don't you see the Senator looking
helpless and alone over there? He's
to take me in, and thinks I'm lost."
"But " Rosemary stopped short,
and went upstairs to the dressing
room with a little sudden heartache.
For a whole month, one only had had
the right and privilege of claiming
her, and now, ehe was free again. She
hoped Helen would not give her to
any one brilliant or strenuous to-night,
who would bother her by trying to
make an impression. She didn't want
to be impressed. In a measure, she
blamed impressionism for her engage
ment to Dean. He was a royal com
rade, clever and responsive, but not
too clever, or too responsive. There
was a difference. Looking back on
the joyous days of the month, she de
cided that it had been this element
of chumship, of mental affinity which
had been responsible for the whole
thing.
As a comrade. Dean was splendid,
but as a lover in the role of pros
pective husband to be wedded to for
life, she had suddenly discovered that
he was exacting, most exacting.
Any man who was engaged to a girl
and positively forbade any other man
falling in love with her was exacting.
Moreover, it was foolish, because,
; really, it was In the abstract a com
pliment to his own good taste.
Sne could not help Jack Stowell
telling her that he loved her. Of
course be loved her. He had told her
bo on an average of twice a month
for over a year. And he was a dear,

rored image of herself in the dressing
room, as she paused to tuck in a few
refractory hairpins. Who could help

span or tandem "
"It's generally tandem, Mrs. Chad
wick," said Dean, with merry scorn.
"There must be a leader t you know,
and Cupid's law Is ladies first"
"Ah, but they are only rose chains,
Dean." The gra^f curls were shaken
at him rebukingly. "And they break
so easily'. Once married they are rose
chains still, but some wise fate has
slipped links of steel beneath . the
petals."
"And if we break them now "
Dean paused.
"Then there are only scattered
roses in the dust, and Cupid weeping,
and rosemary â for remembrance. May
it never come to you." She smiled at
both young faces. "Memory is dear,
but not when all It brings to mind are
the broken rose chains."
There was a momentary hush. The
sweetly modulated old voice had car
ried to the far ends of the table and
all were listening. Rosemary's gaze
rested on her nlate. She dared not
meet Dean's eyes. The hush passed
and there was the low, light babel
of voices again. She heard him speak
ing to her, and held her breath to
listen. "
"Isn't she an old darling to say
that?"
"She doesn't know they are already
broken." He could hardly catch the
half whisper.
"But are they? Only last night, and
no one knows, and it was all a mis
take.". He bent with pleasing eyes
toward her. "Rosemary, my Rose
mary." .
"For remembrance?" She laughed,
a low, tremulous little laugh that was
the first sign of 'surrender.
"For life. Roses are sweet, but they
need the steel.'*
She hesitated, her eyes full of ques
tioning doubt.
"Jack didn't mean anything," she
said hurriedly. "He didn't really pro
pose. He knew that I was engaged,
â¢of course. He only said that he had
always loved" me, and after all, he's
only a boy. It couldn't matter in the
least, his loving me, when "
"When what?"
His tone was full of the old im
perative, proprietary command and
she met his glance for one swift, los
ing instant.
"When I loved you."
Mrs. Creighton was rising. As he
drew back Rosemary's chair he whis
pered: v
"Broken rose chains can be re

He caught a fleeting glimpse of her
face as she passed on in the wake of
Mrs. Chadwick. She was tall and

ROSE CHAINS
They reached the ears of the girl,
and she set forth on her bronco and
tried to trace them to their source.
Men shook their heads in a dubious
way, and refused to give her honest
answers, and at the end of three days
she asked Dave Henderson himself:
"You must know what is being said
of you in connection with the duel?"
He nodded his head.
"And what do you mean to do?"
"Kill Guillo!" he curtly replied.
The words were plain enough, but
there was something in the lover's gen-
ed with being one of the smartest of
the Anglo-Saxon cowboys, and the
other was Guillo Humayun, a Mexican
who could trace his ancestry back to
kings. All other Mexicans on the
ranches were spoken of as "Greasers."
Guillo was always referred to as Senor.
It was a compliment to his aristocratic
face, to his daredevil riding and to his
well-known courage. He had flattered
thi Senorita Huber, as he called her.
He had looked at her in a languishing
way and had spoken soft words of love,
but he had been met by a dignity and a
coldness that froze him out.
In the end the field had been left
to Dave Henderson, and while the
girl's choice had brought to others
humiliation and chagrin, it had also
been tacitly approved by the majority
of the unfortunates. Dave was smart;
he was a good fellow; he was on the
road to secure an interest In the big
"Three Stars." Guillo alone was
chagrined and vengeful, and it soon
became patent that he was biding his
time to provoke an affray, and to use
his guns. It must be brought about
diplomatically, it must come in such
a way as to present an appearance of
fairness, or he would be wiped out by
Dave's friends. To this purpose he
bent all his mental energies. When
the clash finally came "the Senor,"
too, had his backing, and when he de
manded a duel on horseback he was
announced to be within his rights.
Then came a single whisper. Given'
no attention, It soon became a buz
zing. It was said, even by some of
Dave's friends, that he had shown a
touch of the white feather in the first
encounter, and they doubted if he
would do the Three Stars credit on
the day of the duel.
These whispers reached his ears
and he simply replied, "Wait."
THERE was a buzz of talk at the
Thr*-Â«-iitar Ranch, at the Four-X
Ranch, at the roadhouse between
them and at the three or four
scattered cabins along Whip-Snake
Creek. There had been a clash between
Dave Hendtrson of the Three Stan
and Guillo Humayun of the Four X's.
It had been expected for long weeks,
and finally shots had been exchanged,
and Guillo had been slightly wounded.
Men had interfered then, but not until
a duel to the death on horseback had
been arranged to come off a week later.
The widow who had come to act as
landlady ut the roadhouse a year before
waa to blame â the widow Huber and
her daughter Viola, the latter a girl of
â¢eighteen. Their place was a house of
call for travelers, and was well patron
ized, although there was no bar and no
liquor was sold.
" Jf the seventy-five cowboys employed
on the three contiguous ranches were a
unit fn Uoclaring Viola Huber to be the
handsomest, cutest, Jolliest girl ever
seen on the grazing grounds of the
"West, there was no one to dispute. If
half the number fell In love at first
sight, that was only to be expected.
Let it he said, however, that the girl
was not a coquette, and that the adora
tfon and adulation were entirely un
sought for. Xor must one Jump to the
conclusion that thirty or forty cowboys
rode down to the roadhouse and offered
xrmrriaBt- in succession. On the con
trary, few of them ever passed a word
with the girl or got more than a
glimpse of her. They simply loved in
the abstract. Perhaps ten of the lot. In
the course of a year, had opportunities
for conversation, although only two of
them dared to flatter her or speak of
love. One was Dave Henderson, credit-
For thp first time since the duel was
talked about the girl was satisfied.
There was no bragging, no vaporing,
but a quiet, grim determination
Only the cowboys were to witness
the cowboy duel, and they flroit .points
afar off. Not a word was dropped to
the stage passengers who stopped for
breakfaft at 8 o'clock in the morning,
after an all-night ride.
* At 9 Viola stood in the doorway at
the lean-to, gazing with eyes, nar
rowed to a mere slit-out-out across
the endless stretch of sage brush. Be
hind her ran the cottonwood line . * ,hU*
marked the river's course, and beyond
-the bluffs. But the Three Stars men
must come from the prairie road.
Suddenly Viola started. There was a
black speck amid the gray tones or tne
sagebrush. The speck grew and elon
gated. Then she realized that the up
per part of the figure swayed uncer
tainly. It was the movement of a cow
boy sodden drunk in his saddle.
Viola's lips set firmly and her cheeks
blanched. For the pony beneath the
figure was the calico colored bronco
of Dave- Henderson.
The bronco cantered unerringly to .
where the girl stood, and as It stopped
the figure of Dave Henderson slid
limply from saddle to ground. His eyes
were bloodshot, his lips torn where his
teeth had shut tight upon them. One
armâ the rightâ hung useless at his
side and the dull tan of his "chaps
was stained with crimson.
â¢ Henderson clutched at his saddle
pommel and missed it. He swung
around in a half circle and caught at
the doorjamb.
â¢The bunch on the Alameda arroya
stampeded last night. Mighty queer
business. Andâ 1â gotâ thisâ " he tried
to raise the uninjured arm, but failed.
"Treacheryâ damnedâ treaohâ"
Then he lurched through the door
way and lay at her feet, inert.
"The Alameda arroya! And he haa
ridden from there to be on time â with
his arm like that!"
Something hard and hot rose in the
girl's throat, and for a minute she
could not move, could not even go to
the aid of the man she loved. The
primeval instinct of motherhood was
hot within her. The light love of the
girl was smothered by the stronger
emotion.
She called to her mother, and they
carried him into the girl's own room,
and closed the door.
Ten minutes later the widow Huber
was working over the injured cowboy,
but the tears rolling .down her cheeks
were not for the man; for. darting to
ward the grove of cottonwoods, the
calico pony of Dave Henderson carried
a figure that tried to sit up as straight
and stiff as the bronco's owner ever
had.
The cowboys, grouped on the mesa
watched the calico pony come out of
the grove, and the sturdy little gray
bronco Invariably ; ridden by Gullla
dance gingerly from behind the bluffs.
The two horsemen circled around each
other with spirited tactics â and then
Guillo raissd his pistol and shot into
the air. But before the cowboys could
give vent to their amazement, the fig
ure on the calico pony seemed to rise
from the saddle, an arm darted forth â
there was a flash, a report, and Guillo
tumbled to the ground.
With an angry roar at such dishon
orable action on the part of a member
of their own band, the white cowboys
tore down the incline, while from the
bluff rushed the stream of Mexican re
tainers.
The two bands reached the spot
simultaneously. and their leaders
stopped short. For the hat pushed back
from the figure on the calico pony
showed the face of Viola Huber.
Guillo raised himself "on his elbows.
"Senor Henderson," he sneered, "was
afraid. The senorita would save his
honor. I do not fight the duello with
women!"
The girl turned upon the men with
flashing eyes.
"He lies with his last breath! Dave
Henderson wa3 shot before he ever
reached the dueling ground. Ask him
about the midnight assault on Alameda
arroya."
Without another glance in the direc
tion of the dying man. she sprang into
the saddle and the groups parted to let
jher pass.
eral demeanor that sent a chill to the
girl's heart. Somethingâ perhaps in
tuitionâtold her that the man was
either a coward at heart, or he was a
brave man, who realized his danger
and was a bit nervous over jt.
"To-morrow forenoon at 10 o'clock,"
ho said the night before the duel, "I
shall ride forth from the cottonwoods
over there to meet Guillo as he comes
out from behind the bluffs, and I shall
do my best to kill him. We will not
say good-by; I hope to be heVe at this
same hour to-morrow night."
THE SAN FR'ANCISCO SUNDAY CALC,
FOR HONOR'S SAKEcf respect shown in taking off the hat
may tell volumes about their natural
tact and bringing up. It would be well
if all children would Iearri to greet ac
quaintances courteously, to take off the
hat properly, and on the proper occa
sions, to address strangers, when nec
essary, in a polite maner, to give In
formation cheerfully and to help gladly
any one who may need assistance.
Children should be told that friends
and acquaintances are never greeted
by a courteous person with the rude
"Hello!" bo common among our youth.
The hat is taken" offâ not poked at with
a finger.
The name of the person greeted is al
ways spoken. The tone is always pleas
ant; never surly or condescending. A
gentlemanly boy will raise his hat in
bowing to ladies and to elderly men;
to any friend recognized by the lady
whom he may be accompanying; to
any acquaintance 'who is in the com
pany of ladles;, when a gentleman with
him salutes a lady; when he is with a
lady and salutes a gentleman whom he
knows; when he helps In any way a
lady who is a stranger; when he parts
company with a lady.
Manners In Traveling.
Instruct your children that in travel-
Ing conduct â¢ should be marked by
quietness and unselfishness. Air travel
brings enough discomfort without the
added annoyance of noisy and rude fel
low-passengers, or the trouble caused
by ..those who selfishly disregard the
rights of others. Public conveyances
and stations are not the places for loud
talking, for the discussion, of private
affairs, for the display of fine clothes,
or for continual eating.
See that they are made to under
stand that ore of the worst vexations
of travel is the sslflshness often shown.
No one has a right to dispose of his
wraps and luggage so that they are in
the way of others, nor to occupy more
than the seat paid for. when others
need accommodation. Neither should
he open windows when a dangerous
draught or a shower of cinders for his
neighbor will the result, nor spread a
newspaper before his neighbor's face,
nor wriggle and flounce around contin
ually to others' discomfort.
A thoughtful, kind-hearted person
can do much to make a Journey less
wearisome to others, and to Increase
their comfort without being officious.
He can help 'ladles with parcels, or
can turn seats for them, or pull down
blinds, or assist those' unaccustomed
to traveling. He can do all this In
a tactful manner," and without in any,
case trying to make' the acquaintance
of those whom he help, or to be fa
miliar with them. -
. Heâor she, rather. In this case
can have the ticket ready for the con
ductor without the delay often no
ticed. The well-bred person will
never crowd past others, or be in a
hurry, which always implies confusion,
and; of ten\ results- in accidents, ; mis
takes or loss. He will, too, keep his
seat till the train stops and leave, it
more safely and gracefully.
At a service in church we should
scarcely expect to see bad manners, as
we should suppose that the sacred*
ness of the place and the solemnity
inspired by its associations would be
sufficient to guarantee correct be
havior. Yet any observant attendant
at church will notice many things in
children which betrays great thought
lessness, a lack of a sense of propriety
and a want jj of the reverence that
should be a trait in every well-formed
character. Many of these faults are
due to carelessness, many to ignor
ance, and their correction should be
insisted upon by all parents.
See that they understand that it is
bad manners to come to church late;
it disturbs others and attracts notice.
It can generally be avoided. It Is
commonly the same people that walk
in late Sunday after Sunday. The
habit shows a disregard for others'
rights 1 that is inexcusable. Tell them
that in the rare .cases when late at
tendance is unavoidable a back seat
should be quietly taken, and any fur
ther progress up the' aisle' made when
the congregation stands up.
Do not fail to teach them that showy
and over- rich â¢ garments . should not be
worn to church. They are out of keep
ing with the object of the service; and
they j attract notice, and . sometimes
quite distract the attention of others.
Plain dressing is in better taste, even
for those who can afford expensive
clothes; and the poor will not be kept
WHEREVER children are
thrown into contact with the
public, whether on the street,
in traveling, in churches or
in places of amusement, good breeding
has a wide opportunity to speak well
' for the home influences which have
Eurrcunded them. Bad taste, coarseness
and vulgarity have ample scope for ex
hibition and for proclaiming one's
"standards, associations and family
â¢ training.
â¢ All are judged in public entirely by
their appearance and actions. The
many people who see children have no
time to Inquire into the standing of the
family and to make excuses for
thoughtlessness. They grade them at
first sight, and parents owe it to them
eelves to see that their children behave
appropriately everywhere, no matter
how far they may be from home.
Many young people who are carefully
trained at home and who conduct
themselves with tolerable propriety un
der the parental eye are very careless
about their behavior when unaccompa
nied by their elders on the street or in
.public places. They thereby cause
'much criticism on their own characters
and many unflattering comments on
their parents.
Children should early learn that good
taste and good sense require that a
high standard of conduct should be
maintained with special strictness in
'public. They should be taught that no
well-bred people wish the attention of
. strangers called to them; that to make
one's self as inconspicuous as possible
is the general rule of conduct outside
of the home. Many of the following
special rules arc intended to secure
this result.
Attracting Attention on the Street.
See that your children know that all
showy or gaudy dress is in bad taste
on the street, because if attracts notice.
Quiet colors should be used; extreme
fashions should be avoided.
Have them understand that noisy
talking and laughing, indulgence in
rough sport, are rude anywhere. They
are especially so on the street, or in
public conveyances. Young people are
often thoughtlessly noisy on their way
to and from school. They take up more
than their share of the pavement,
crowding and pushing others, or block
the way at street corners while trying
to bid one another adieu. By their bad
manners, they bring on themselves,
their family and their school an
amount of blame that can easily be
avoided.
Other actions, awkward in them
eelves, and drawing unpleasant notice,
are such tricks as eating, or chewing
gum in public, pointing at objects,
turning around to gaze at people, or
etaring at them, or staring in at pri
vate windows. See that your children
are told that these last faults are not
only awkward and noticeable, but are
signs of a vulgar . curiosity that is
never felt by a well-bred person.
Greeting Acquaintances.
Another group of rules concerns the
greetings they may give to those whom
they meet Much of character Is re
vealed by the way In which. they sa
lute or speak to others. The little act
from attendance by too sharp a con
trast between their garments and thosa
of their wealthier neighbors.
Explain that no gaping around to see
who are in seats further back, or who
are entering, should be indulged in. If
the culprits in this respect could see the
ridiculous and "gawky" effect of their
twisted necks, perhaps vanity would
stop the ill-bred practice".
See that they are told that no whis
pering or laughing in church is per
missible. 'Nothing is more irreverent
than this; nothing so disturbs the wor
shipers; nothing so deserves instant
rebuke from the officiating clergyman.
Of course, no right-minded child will
wear his hat inside of a church door,
or scribble in books in the pews; yet
occasional .offenses in these respects
call for a word of protest and caution.
No well-bred person will lounga in
church, or yawn, or be Inattentive. He
will, bo far as he can, follow the forms
of the service, and take part where it is
proper to do bo. He will, of course,
not laugh at anything said or done,
even if the form of worship be unfa
miliar to him, or the ceremonies Incom
prehensible.
He will not be guilty of the "bad
form" shown in slamming books into
racks, instead of gently slipping them
in; or in making preparations for de
parture while the minister Is concluding
the service. He will remember, too, on
the way out that the church is not the
place for social calls. Reverence re
quires -that he should pass out quietly.
Manners In Plnces of Amusement.
Children should learn that in places
of amusement bad manners are an in
fringement on the rights of others who
have come for pleasure and have paid
for their amusement. No one has
any business to come late to a play or
a concert or a lecture. It breaks in
upon the performance and disturbs
persons and audience alike. If one
must be late, he should stand until tha
musical selection is finished and then
go to his seat with as littla Incon
venience to others as possible. Â¦Â£ :-.!..
Children should be told that talking
during the performance la Intolerable,
as it distracts attention and deprives
others of pleasure. Expressions of Im
patience at delays are like such ex
pressions everywhere â ill-bred. Com
posure and patience mark the gentle
man and lady under all circumstances.
Applause should be given to what
meets with approval. It is right and
proper to give such a tribute to skill
and artistic merit: but a demonstra
tion with the feet is unnecessary "and
rude.
One should stay until the close of
the entertainment, even if it has
proved tiresome, unless some Impera
tive reason exists why one should
leave early. At the present time hats
are generally removed by ladles and
girls at public entertainments, so that
the woman or girl who keeps her
head-covering on is rather conspic
uous than otherwise, and may obstruct
the view of those behind her. |j Â£.
Finally, teach your children that no
rules can provide for every variety of
circumstances that may corns into
their experience as they meet and
deal with others; buc the possession
of good sense, good taste, and an, un
selfish spirit will show them what to
do In each case. If their behavior is
guided by these, they may be sure
that It will be appropriate.

(CoTJTlshtfl 1904 hy Central Newi and Pres:
'I am glad I am not an American
husband. At first sight this may ap
pear a remark uncomplimentary to the
American v.ife. It is nothing of the
"eort. It is just the other way about.
We In Europe have plenty of opportu
nity of judging the American wife. In
America you hear of the American
wife, you are told stories about the
American wife, you see her portrait in
the illustrated Journals. By searching
.under the heading "Foreign Intelli
gence" you can find out what she is
doing. â¢ But here In Europe we know
'jier, meet her face to face, talk to her,
flirt with her. She is charming! â¢ â¢ â¢
delightful! That is why I say I am
.glad I am not an American husband.
If the American husband only knew
â¢irow really nice the American wife was
â¢J;e would sell his business and come
over here, where now and then he could
eee her. Tears ago, when I first began
'to travel about Europe, I argued to
Â«yself that America must be a deadly
â¢place to live in. How sad it Is, I
â¢thought to myself, to meet thus, wher
ever one goes, American widows by
the thousand. In one narrow by-street
cf Dresden I calculated fourteen Amer
ican mothers, possessing nine-and
twenty bright American children, and
not a father among them â not a single
'husband between the whole fourteen!
I pictured fourteen lonely graves, scat
tered over the United States. I saw,
Â£3 in a vision, those fourteen head
etones of best material, hand-carved,
recording: the virtues of those fourteen
Â£ead and burled husbands. Odd.
thought I to myself, most decidedly
odd, these American husbands; they
must be a delicate type of humanity.
The wonder is their mothers ever
â¢reared them. They marry fine girls ap
parently, the majority of them; two or
three sweet children are born to them,
end after that there seems to be no
â¢further use for them as far as this
â¢world is concerned. Can nothing be
.done to strengthen their constitutions?
'Would a tonic be of any help to them?
Not the customary tonic, I don't mean,
the sort of tonic merely intended to
and off." "And all alone?'' I com
mented with a sigh intended to invite
confidence. "Well, hardly alone,"
she corrected me, while a look of.pa
tient resignation added dignity to her
piquant features; "you see, there are
the dear children always round about
me during the holidays. Besides," she
added, "the people here are, all so real
kind to me, they hardly ever let Â»me
feel myself alone. We make up littla
parties, you knoyr, picnics and excur
sions; and then, of course,' there is the
opera and the symphony concerts arid,
the subscription dances. The dear.old
King has been doing a good deal thia
winter, too, and I must say the em
bassy folks have been most thoughtful
so far as I am- concerned.* No, it
would not be right for me to com
plain of loneliness, not now that M
have got to know a few people, as it
were." "But, don't you miss your
husband?" I suggested. A cloud
passed over her usually sunny face.
"Oh, please, don't talk about him,"
Ehe said; "it makes me feel read,
sad thinking about him." But
having commenced I was deter
mined that my s'ympathy should not
be left to waste. "What did he , die
of?" I asked. She gave me a look,
the pathos of which I shall never for
get. "Say, young man," she cried,
"are you trying to break It to me
gently? Because if so, I'd ratheryou
told me straight out. What did he die
of?" "Then, isn't he dead?" I asked;'
â¢'I mean so far as you know?" "Never
heard a word about his being dead till
you started the idea," she retorted.
"So far as I know, he's alive and well."
I said that I was sorry. I went on
to explain that I did not mean that I
was sorry to hear that in all proba
bility he was alive and well; what I
meant was that I was sorry I had in
troduced a painful - subject. "What
painful subject?" '.'Why, your hus
band," I replied. "But why should
you call hhn a painful subject?" I
had an idea that she was getting an
gry with me. She did not say so; I
gathered ifi Buf I had to explain my
self somehow. "Well," I answered,
ft I take it you didn't get on weif to
gether and I am sure it must, have
been his fault." "Now, look here,"
she said, "don't you breathe a word
against my husband or we shall quar
rel., A nicer, dearer fellow never
lived." "Then what did you divorce
him for?" - I asked. It * was imper
tinent, it was unjustifiable. My ex
cuse is that the mystery surrounding
the American husband had been wor
rying me for months. Here had I
stumbled upon the â¢â¢ opportunity of
solving it. -." Instinctively I clung to my
advantage. "There has not been any
divorce. There is not going to be any
divorce. You will make me cross in
another minute." But I was becom

are not divorced from ' him! â¢ â¢ â¢
Where is he?" I demanded with soma
heat. "Where la he," she replied, as
tonished, "where should he be? At
home, of course." I looked around
the luxuriously furnished room with its
air of cozy comfort, of substantial rest
fulness. "What home?" I asked. "What
home! â¢ Why, our home in Dstroit."
"What is he doing there?" I 'had
become so much In earnest that my
voice had assumed unconsciously an
authoritative tone. Presumably It hyp
notized her. She answered my question
as though she had been in the witness
box. "How do I know? How can I
possibly tell what he is doing? What
do people usually do at home?" "An
swer the questions, madame, don't ask
them. What are you doing here? Quite
truthfully, if you please." My eyes
were fixed upon her. "Enjoying myself.
He likes me to enjoy myself. Besides,
I am educating the children." "You
mean they are here at boarding-school,
while you are gadding about. What is
wrong with American education? When
did you secyour husband last?" "Last?
Let me see! No, last Christmas I was
make gouty old gentlemen feel they
want to buy a hoop, but the sort of
tonic for which it i3 claimed that If you
poured three drops upon a ham sand
wich the next moment you would hear
itâ the ham sandwichâ grunt.
Also, it struck me as pathetic, the
thought of -these American widows in
their thousands, leaving their native
land, coming over in Ehiploadsi to
spend the rest of their blighted lives
in exile. The mere thought of Amer
ica, I took it, had forever become to
them distasteful. The ground that
once his feet had pressed! â¢ â¢ â¢ The
old familiar places once lighted by his
smile! â¢ â¢ â¢ Everything in America
would remind them of him. Snatching
their babes to their heaving bosoms,
they would leave the country where
lay buried all the Joy of their lives,
eeek In the retirement of Paris, Flor
ence or Vienna oblivion of the past.
Also, it struck me as beautiful: the
noble resignation with which they bore
their grief, hiding their sorrow from
the indifferent stranger. Some widows
make a fuss, go about for weeks look
ing gloomy and depressed, make not
the slightest effort to bo merry. These
fourteen widows â I know them person
ally, all of them. I lived in the same
street â what brave show of cheerful
ness they made! what a lesson to the
common or European widow, the
humpy type of v.idr.-.v. One could
spend whole days in their company â I
had done it â commencing quite early In
the morning with a. sleighing excursion,
finishing' up Quite late in the evening
with a little supper party followed by
an impromptu dance, and never detect
from their outward manner that they
were not thoroughly enjoying them
selves. From the mothers I turned my
admiring eyes toward the children.
This is the. secret of American success,
said I to myself, this high-spirited
courage, this- Spartan contempt for
suffering:. Look at them, the gallant
little men and women! "Who would
think that they had lost a father? Wliy.
I have seen a British 'child more
upset at losing sixpence. Talking to
a little girl one day, I inquired of her
concerning the health of, her father.
The next moment I could have bitten
my tongue out, remembering that there
wasn't such a thing as a father â not an
American father â in the whole street.
She did not burst into tears like they
do in the story books. She said, "He
is quite well, thank^you,". simply, pa-<
thetically, just like that. "I am sure
of it," I replied with fervor, "well and
happy, as he deserves to be, and one
day you will find him again; you will
go to him." "Ah, yes," she answered,
a Ehining light. It seemed to me, upon
her fair young face. "Mamma says she
is getting Just a bit tired of this one
horse sort of place. She is quite look-
Ing forward to seeing him again." It
touched me very deeply â this weary
woman, tired of her longr bereavement,
actually looking forward to the fear-
Fome passage, leading her to where
the loved one waited for her in a better
land.
For one bright, breezy creature I
grew to feel a real regard. All the
months that I hcd known her, seen
her almost daily, never once had I
heard a single cry of pain escape her
lips, never once had I heard her curs-
Ing fate. Of the many who called
upon her in her charming flat not one
had ever, to my knowledge, offered her
consolation or condolence. It seemed
to me cruel, callous. The overbur
dened heart, finding no outlet for its
imprisoned grief, no sympathetic ear
into which to pour its tale of woe,
breaks, we are told; anyhow, it isn't
good for it. I decided â no one else
seeming keen â that I would supply
that sympathetic ear, and the very
next time I found myself alone with
her I introduced the subject. "You
have been living here in Dresden a
long time, have you not?" I asked.
"About five years," she answered, "on

of the late Queen Isabella of Spain,
who died recently in Paris, will be of

ing that has a romantic history reveal
ing some of the good traits of this
most reckless Queen-
Before her exile, when as Dowager
Queen she was causing all manner of
political and social troubles in royal
circles, she received a visit from the
painter Antonio Gisbert, who had been
ruined financially by some political
upheaval in Spain. Isabella lent him
$160,000, taking no security. Gisbert
afterward achieved fame as a painter
of historical subjects and some por
traits. * Among the latter Is a portrait
of the late William Astor of New York,
which is Â¦well known.
Gisbert never acquired wealth
enough to repay his debt to the gen
erous Q[ueen* but after his death some
years ago his children found among his
papers a memorandum of the loan and
promptly offered her several of his best
works. The Queen selected only one
and returned the remainder/ saying
that the debt canceled. This
painting is a striking one, representing
the Emperor" Francis I meeting his be

LATE QUEEN ISABELLA
A GENEROUS GIVER
ENGLISH YACHTSWO
MEN AND TWO CHIL
DREN OF NOBILITY,
of jewelry given by a husband to his wife to enable her to shine in society.
Such Is one of the seeming paradoxes of English law as just laid down by
, that high and learned judicial body, the Court of Appeal, in the case of Lord
vs. Lady Howard of Glossup. It goes farther than this. The husband may
not only claim as his own property the articles of adornment which he has
given his wife, even though bestowed upon her prior to their marriage; ho
may actually sell them and devote the money to his own use.
This is what brought about the decision. Before Lord Hgward of GIos
sop married his second wife in 1891, as proof both of his generosity and.un
dying devotion, he presented her with a costly diamond tiara. As the years
rolled by, however, his love cooled. The marriage proved an unhappy one.
Lady Howard commenced proceedings last year for â¢Â«. judicial separation,
but the outcome was a separation, under a private agreement, which pro-!
vided that all jewejry, ornaments, etc., belonging to Lady Howard should
""remain under her exclusive control.
She did not, however, get the diamond tiara and brought suit* to re
cover it. Lord Howard asserted that he had sold it for $4000 three months
prior to the agreement. The decision of the lower, courts, adverse to Lady
Howard's claim, was sustained by the Court of Appeal. In concurring in
?the opinion of the Master of the Rplls, Lord Justice Romer stated that any
gifts made by a husband to a wife, "suitable for her position in society,"
were not "gifts to her separate use." but constituted "paraphernalia which
the husband had a right to sell." And it follows that hereafter the woman
who regards such gifts as her own property will merely discover that she
has been "sold." But the law does not work both ways. What the wife gives
the husband remains his for "keeps," from embroidered slippers to a watch
and chain or a house and lot.
THE QUEEN A LOVER OP CHILDREN.
Queen Alexandra acts the fond grandm'other to perfection and . is hap
piest when she gets an hour to herself in which to play with the little ones
of the royal family. Her face wears its most contented expression when she
drives in the park with little Prince Edward of Wales at her side, and many
a time does a royal carriage bear the Queen to an ordinary London house
in an ordinary London square where the lackeys who open to her are greeted
by the first lady in the land with a pleasant smile and word, and whence
a few moments later she emerges with two happy little, girls plainly, attired
and each affectionately grasping a doll with one hand 'and the Queen's arm
with- the other. The little girls are the daughters of the -Duke of Fife, the
Ladies Duff, and are the oldest grandchildren of the Queen, to whom they
are devoted.
There are many distinguished women in England who sail yachts, but
do not race them, contenting themselves with the der form of/ enjoy
rrvnt to be got out of cruising:. Among them may be mentioned Princess
Henry of Battenberg. who is often seen flitting over the Solent in her pretty
little craft, .'le Sheila; Princess Victoria, Princess Charles f Denmark,
Lady Albcmarle. Lady Ormond and Lady Margai '. Orr Ewing. The Coun

The Duchess of Sutherland has sailed many seas in her steam yacht, the
Catania. Constanpe. Lady de la Warr, frequently takes long cruises with
hrr daughters and has written charmingly of her travels. The Duchess of
Somerset and the Duchess of Leeds are experienced yachtswomen, with a

Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, daughter of the late Lord Bute, has

enjoys having her own way. she came to the conclusion that the only way

Herreshoff owed his first introduction to British yachtsmen to a woman.
Miss Winifred Sutton, daughter of the late Sir Richard Sutton, who made
a vain attempt to capture the America's cup with the Genesta. Impressed
by *fce result of that contest with the superiority of Yankee designers,
Miss Button gave Herreshoff an order for a half-rater, which she felici
tously named "*Vee Win." And win she did from everything in her class,
Miss Sutton always steering the boat herself -r.-:th one man to attend the
sheets. But Miss Sutton some years ago abandoned ya.ht racing for
matrimony.
That excitement, she declares, constitutes the best antidote to seasick
ness, and vomen who fall an easy victim to it under ordinary circum
etasiccs will triumph over it when they find themselves on a winning yacht.
Mrs. L. W. Wylie, wife of the distinguished marine painter, has
achieved many notable victories in small yacths. When some Australian
yachtsmen sent a challenge to the Medway Yacht Club, Mrs. Wylie was
selected to steer the British boat, not as a compliment to her sex, but
because it was generally conceded that she could do It better than any man
5n the club. And she Justified the faith in her by winning all of the five
races sailed. .
Mrs. Schenley' s husband is a yachtsman and a member of the aristo
cratic Royal Yacht Squadron, but when it comes to yacht racinp he pre
fers to play the role of a spectator from the deck of his comfortable steam
yacht while his intrepid wife struggles for victory. When there are no
more prizes to be won cÂ« the Solent, Mr. and Mrs. Schenley betake them
selves to Albania in the steam yacht and hunt deer and chamois in the
mountain-. Mrs. Schenley's two sisters, the Misses Hughes, though they
do not own racing yachts now, are almost equally expert sailors and are
In great demand as amateur skippers. '
FRESH SEA AIR AND SALT WATER ARE SEDUCTIVE.
"How much better than a London drawing-room's close atmosphere,"
.writes Miss Barbara Hughes, "is the fresh sea air, and the delightful free
dom of bounding over the waves in a well-equipped craft, with the addi
tional pinch of excitement afforded by racing."
Next to Miss Cox, Mrs. H. G. Allen was the most successful yachts
woman last season. In her Sorais II, a thirty-foot linear rater, she took
part in forty-eight races, crossing the winning line first in twenty-three of
[them and capturing thirteen other prizes, making thirty-six in all.
In previous years Miss Cox's greatest rival in yachting among her sex
has been Mrs. G. A. Schenley, who, by the way, is just as clever with a
Fhotgun or rifle as she is with the tiller. She entered the racing lists In 1839
with the two-and-one-half rater Thief. Next year she went into a bigger class.
racinjr the five-rater Valentine. The Valentine did not prove a success,
"however, and the following year the plucky woman faced the starting line
with another yacht, the Windfall â about thirty feet on the water line^
iind reaped the reward she merited, leading the class at the close of the
weapon with twenty-two first prizes and twelve others. Since then she has
raced, with varying success in several yachts. The harder it blows the
better she likes it. To see her at the tiller in a thrash to windward in
'half a pale of wind with lee rails hidden by a smother of foam and the
cpray dashing mast high is a sight much more calculated to Impress the
observer with proper ideas concerning the equality of the sexes than any
number of speeches by the most voluble of woman agitators.
*Mrs. Schenley has met with some thrilling experiences while yacht
racing, but they have only Increased her ardor for the sport. In one race
'she was caught In a thunderstorm and her boat was struck by lightning.
â¢"There was a flash," she says, in a description she has given of the inci
dent, "and a tremendous clap of thunder, all on board feeling the shook.
I was nearly stunned and did not know what had happened. At this time'
the boat was tearing through water with the sea up to the eJge of the
well, pr'-at hailstones and blinding sheets of spray flying in one's face, so
that Fleering at that moment became very dangerous, and if it had not
been for the easing of our main sheet no doubt we should have stood some
chance of filling our boat. The squall lasted 4>nly a few moments. On
examination we found that our yard had been splintered and burned by
the Lightning, but this did not prevent us crossing the line a triumphant
It is generally conceded that Miss Cox is the most expert yachtswoman
"in England, and if any man thinks that he can coax more speed out of a
tioat than she can Miss Cox is always more than willingHto make a match
with him. But so far as another sort of match is concerned she is wedded
lo the sea and hoe been ever since she began racing back in 1887. With
her it is an hereditary taste. Her father, Frederick Cox, is commodore of
the Royal Southampton Yacht Club, but he long ago admitted that his
daughter had found out more about yacht racing than he had ever been
able to teach her. Last year in her crack twenty-four-^oot linear rater
Puet, Miss Cox participated in fifty-four races and came up top of the
class with thirty-seven first and eight other prizes to her credit. Prior to
that for three years in succession she had carried aff premier honors in
the same class with her famous little flyer Speedwell.
* ' â¢ Fully to appreciate such an achievement it must be borne in mind that
Miss -Cox's opponents include some of the best amateur yachtsmen in Eng
land, and that she is not merely on the yacht, but actually sails it, being
always at the tiller. Instead of the competing boats being allowed from
two to five minutes in which to cross the line, as Is customary in America,
â¢the time at which they go over the line within that period being recorded
i^s their starting time, the one gun start is the rule here. By this method
\he yacht first over the line gets the full credit for the skill, Jierve and
Judgment exercised by her skipper in securing the coveted place. When,
as often happens, there are a dozen yachts trying for it, their skippers
all keenly alert to obtain the opening advantage, it Is a very ticklish game,
requiring a cool head, masterly skill and prompt decision. At this species
.of nautical jockeying Miss Cox has no superior and can shave by another
boat when collision can be escaped only by a hair's breadth. Miss Cox has
.a.gne town residence at No. 3 Grosvenor Crescent, but when the yachting
fiason ojiens she betakes herself to the Solent and London knows her no
more until the last race has been sailed. . .: , . .. -

MISS COX AX EXPERT SAILOR GIRL.
There are several women in England who do this and have done it
fat years, taking the weather as it comes, blow high or blow low, sailing
dozens of races in the course of a season, and often winning more of
tliern than any of the men who race against them. Hardly a year .has
grone by since English women took to yacht racing that one of them has
not been able to hoist more winning flags on her yacht at the end of a
reason than any of the boats in the same class sailed by men were able to
display. Not seldom in more than or.e class in the same year women have
achieved championship honors. It is all the more creditable to them that
they have made these records in comparatively small boats. The big
boats have all professional skippers and their owners for the most part
content themselves with footing the bills and decorating their sideboards
vith the silver plate won.
LONDON, May 21. â Although. American women generally are just as
keen devotees of fresh air pastimes as their British sisters, there is ona
form of out-door sport, and that as invigorating and exciting as any, in
whiph the American woman still lags far behind her British rival. That
is yacht sailing, and more particularly yacht racing. -
There are, of course, many American women â¢who can handle a yacht
fairly well when put to it. On rare occasions Transatlantic yacht clubs
hold "ladies' day" regattas, when the members intrust the tillers of the
competing boats to their sweethearts, wives and sisters, doing whatever
coaching may be necessary themselves. But no American woman has the
writer ever heard of who both owns and saila a racing yacht, meeting
men on equal terms and neither asking nor receiving any odds" on account
of her sex-
It is a matter of general talk in society circles that Lady Curzon is en
tirely responsible for the sudden determination of her husband to return
to England. Her ladyship was glad to accept the honor of the Indian
viceroyalty, but she rebelled against staying in India beyond the three years
which the appointment imposes. She found native servants and officials by
no means agreeable to her tastes, besides she was losing all the glamor of
English society, and she insisted that three years was long enough to spend
among the Rajahs and other formidably titled persons in Calcutta and other
places. When his -lordship agreed to stay in India, her ladyship, after a pro
test, set about packing her trunks and as soon as she had put her domestic
affairs in order she took the next steamer for England. She was anxious,
too, that her baby should be born in Engk d and she was much annoyed
because her husband allowed her to take the journey alone In her condition.
His lordshi- will, on his arrival in England, get his first look at the
daughter who has just been added to the Curzon household.
Within a few months Lady RIerrick'Burrill, who before her marriage
was Miss Wilhelmina Winans of Baltimore, once more will be able to use
Knepp Castle, her favorite home In Sussex, from which she was driven by
fire about two months ago. As, the flames left nothing but the outside
walls of the old building, it has been necessary -to prepare plans for an
entirely new structure. These ; have just been finished, â¢ and workmen will
begin clearing the ruins at once, preparatory to rebuilding.

The Duchess has a double object in inviting her relations to. London.
She is yearly becoming more interested in charitable Institutions in England
and knowing that the family dispense charity rather liberally in Paris, she
is anxious to divert some portion of it into English channels. Her own do
nations to certain institutions have been the means of bringing down on her
such an i avalanche of applications from other places all over the country
that she finds the strain of responding favorably to them all too severe for
her purse. "Poor thing," said a sympathetic matron of a children's hospi
tal, "she cannot bear to refuse any application. Something always comes."

ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOM

Odd Fellowship.
During the session of the Grand
Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd
Fellows, which terminated its labors
on the second Friday in May, there was
presented to it, from the Grand Lodge
of Georgia, a set of sentiments relative
to the recent visit of Past^gjrand Mas
ter W. H. Barnes 'to that body, which,
close with the following words:
"Brother W. H. Barnes has been the
golden link that has clasped Georgia
and California Odd Fellowship. May
this tie grow stronger and more endur-Â«
ing until we shall, in loving comrade
ship, meet in that Sovereign Grand
Lodge whose 'sessions are held beyond
the stars."
Past Gr-and Master Barnes will short
ly leave for the East, and while there
will go to Atlanta, where he will be
tendered a reception by the Odd Fel
lows of that city on the evening of
June 9. In a letter to Mr. Barnes, Grand
Master John A. Hynds writes that dur
ing the past year the order in Georgia
instituted fifty new lodges and initiated
5000 strangers. Before going to^ Atlanta
Mr. Barnes will visit Millldgeville, Ga.,
where, he was initiated into Odd Fel

Alexandre Dumas the younger was
in a way, to France what Ibsen is to
Norway. His plays exposed social
conditions and are merciless in their
truth. Dumas showed French society
its immorality and depravity, and he
made no effort to gloss over the wick
edness of French civilization. He, too,
was a master of techni*"-ie - and an
Victorien SardSu, the most noted of
living French playwrights, is now
nearly 73 years old, having been born
September 7, 1831. He began his
career as a student of medicine, but
soon gave this up for literature. His
first efforts were very unsuccessful,
and it was not until after his marriage
to a young actress who had influence
with the famous Mme. de Jazet that
the tide turned in his favor. From the
production of his first play in 1854
until the present time Sardou has seen
about 100 of his works staged.
Of these the most familiar to Amer
ican theater-goers are "Diplomacy,"
"La Tosca." "Fedora," "Theodora,"
"Gismonda," % "Mme. Sans Gene,"
"Robespierre," "Dante" and "Divor
cons." His plays are powerful, but
often incline to the melodramatic and
lack the note of realism. "Divorcons,"
one of his f e^fr comedies, shows Sardou
in his happiest vein.
Miss Fritzi Scheff sang under diffi
culties at Kansas C*ty in "Babette."
She had a severe cold, but rather
than disappoint her audience by not

will retire from the company tempo
rarily, at least, and her part will be
sung by Miss Ida Hawley. Miss

Jdseph M. Weber will not confine

Lillian Russell in the John Kendrick
Bangs and A. Baldwin Sloans musical
piece, "Lady Teazle," which is to be
seen at the Knickerbocker Theater
next season, following immediately the
run of the Rogers Brothers 'at that
house.
This will be the first of Weber's
independent ventures, but from all ac
counts it will not be the last by any
means. The play xeferred to is a
musical comedy version of Sheridan's
"School for Scandal," and was at first
intended for the use of Mabelle Gil

"La Femme de Claude" ("Cesarino").
The work of the younger Dumas is in
striking contrast with that of his
father, whose historical novels are
classics. Dumas fils was born July 2S.

CELEBRATED SINGER TALKS OF AMERICA, ENGLAND AND AUSTRALIA.
In Hartford, Michigan, a quaint lit
tle towrf* surrounded on all sides by
multitudes of flowering fruit trees, a
company of young people, some of
whom are descendants of the Potta
watomie Indians, are rehearsing a
drama called "The Queen of the
Woods." This play, which is a rep
resentation of the beautiful and pa
thetic love story of Chief Simon Poka
gon, oneVof the most noted Indians of
nil time, tells the story of the love
making and the tragic incidents of the
famous old chief, who now lies buried
in the Indian cemetery, near the little
Catholic church at Rush Lake.
The piece itself is not a triumph of
dramatic art. It is more like one of
the early attempts at plays and has a
certain crude dignity that /puts it
alongside the rude but effective repre
sentations of the passion play at
Oberammergau. In the stately Algon
quin, tongue, the- play Is called
"O-Gi-Maw-Mit-I-Gwa-Ki," which be
ing translated into English means
"The Queen of the .Woods."
The play abounds in Indian lore,
and is based on fact. Before Simon
Pokagon died he wrote a book which
he called "The Queen of the Woods."
This book has been praised In many
quarters because of its beautiful and
stately Engl'- '\. In this story the old
Heyse has been called essentially
a modern pessimist. A Jew by birth,
he ia an intellectual follower o^
Strauss in religion and of Schopen
hauer in philosophy. But he has
striven to find a faith for himself in
the service of beauty , and has not
hesitated to show his scorn of con
ventional beliefs.
/ . â¢ * *
"Mary of Magdala," which Heyse
intended should be the crowning work
of his career, Is the only one of his
plays that has been acted in English.
Heyse has derived a large income
from his works. He spends much of
his time in Italy, where he has a
handsome villa. He has also a resi
dence in Berlin and a country home in
Germany.
His travels showed him the narrow
ness and conventionalism of Norway
and the evils that must result from it,
and he has since devoted his pitiless
pen to picturing and satirizing social
conditions in his own country. His
dramas were a revelatidn. Truth and
realism their keynote, they are mar
velous in stagecraft, tremendous in
power and absolutely devoid of theat
rical artifice.
Paul Heyse, author of "Mary of
Magdala," has been as prolific as Ibsen
in his output of dramas, poetry and
fiction. He has written about fifty
plays, many of which are acted fre
quently at the German theaters, and
is well if not better known as a novel
ist chiefly from the popularity of his
story, "The Children of the World."
Heyse was born in Berlin, March 15,
1830. His father was a professor at
the University of Berlin, and' there
and at the University of Bonn, Paul
Heyse received his education. His
plays have been, as a rule, of the'ro
mantic type, and he Is not a follower
of the modern school.
Politics interesting him, he became
an ardent radical and wrote poems
of a revolutionary nature. In later
years Ibsen changed his politics, and
has long been a conservative. Hia
first play, "The Warrior's Barrow,"
was produced in Christiania in 1850.
Soon after this he was made stage
manager of the Bergen Theater, and
there developed his genius /for stage
technique. All this time he had been
writing historical dramas, poems and
novels in profusion. His works were
then of the romantic type, and it was
not until, on a poet's pension, he
traveled extensively through Europ'e.
that he turned his attention to the
modern realistic dramas on which his
fame rests.
Ibsen was born at Skein, Norway,
March 20, 1828, the son of a rich mer
chant, whose subsequent failure de
stroyed young Ibsen's hopes of a uni
versity career. Instead of becoming
an artist, as had been his wish, he
took a position as clerk in a drug
store, and while there educated him
self. When about 21 he published his
firs.t book, which was a complete fail
ure.
Of living playwrights Henrik Ibsen
is the greatest, for he founded the
modern realistic drama and revolu
tionized the drama of every nation.
Time was when his greatness was
recognized by few, and it was the
fashion to ridicule him. To-day, when
his seventy-sixth birthday has passed,
his plays are in the repertory of every
theater of prominence in continental
Europe, and the public of England
and America has awakened to a recog
nition of his worth.
FOUR GREAT WRITERS
WHOSE PRODUCTIONS
ARE DRAMATIC GEMS
There are signs of reawakening at
Fischer's new theater that will now

also have two hundred new seats. The
company, /with the exception of Ben
Dillon and Roy Alton, will be entirely

The MacDowell season of Sardou
plays at the Grand Opera-house will
continue this week with the presenta
tion of "Fedora," in which as Louis
Spanoff Mr. MacDowell finds one of
his most congenial opportunities.
The following week the actor will
produce a new romantic drama, "A
Captain of Navarre." Afterward
comes Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Du Bar
ry," in which the actress repeated her
triumph in "Zaza."
The Alcazar keeps well abreast of
its reputation for enterprise. They
produce another new farce there this
week by Sydney Rosenfeld, "A Possi
ble Case." It will be done for the
first time here.
This evening at the California be
gins the usual summer season of the
Xeill-Morosco stock company, with
"When We Were Twenty-one" as the
bill. The new company, that, how
ever, includes many of the older mem
bers, is saidUo be unusually strong this
season. It has won much favorable
commendation since its inception.
Most engaging, endearing again, is
his Prince Karl in "Old Heidelberg,"
an apotheosis of fragrant youth. Mr.
Mansfield seems to have kicked the
centuries avay, washed himself of ex
perience, urunken of the fountain of
youth for this characterization. It is
instinct with romance, poetry, delicate
pathos. The story is only that of a
poor little princelet, brought up by
hand in all the stifling ceremonial of a
small German court and flung for four
months into the free, fighting, singing,
bubbling student life of "Old Heidel
berg." He learns what it is to be a
man, not a royal machine. He learns
the fun of work, of love, of play. And
he has to leave them. That is all, but
most fascinating in its presentation by
Mr. Mansfield. "Old Heidelberg" offers
also other noteworthy opportunities.
Miss Conquest as the maid of the inn,
Katie, wholesome, joyous, womanly,
kind â yet not too kind â the sister and
pet of all the students that frequent
the house, the humble sweetheart of
the Prince, is a figure of most engag
ing charm. She stands worthily be
side Mr. Mansfield.
Mr. A. G. Andrews as the Prince's
tutor is also rhost gratefully in the
picture, and the valet of Mr. Kenyon.
Students and courtiers fill up the can
vas and with their be-plastered faces,
songs, uniforms, gayety, ceremony,
contribute to an illusion without flaw.
Then followed the Baron Chevrial â
infinite, indeed, is the Mansfield va
riety. It is an historic leer. And
"Beau Brummel," perfect in pathos,
attic in comedy, the sublimation of the
fop, wherein shall one find the Mans
field gallery lacking? One remembers
only afterward that there is a mechan
ism of the art, remembers only after
ward that one can hear every word
that is said; that the splendid voice
runs cunningly the whole gamut of
expressive tone; that the makeup is
the work of a Velasquez of the art;
that the gesture is eternally fit; that
the facial language is invariably the
illumined index of the thought, so per
fectly the artist covers his technical
tracks. And this surpassing artistry
is felt to the last 'detail of he produc
tions, lavish, correct, moving as on
wheels. Their season is an experience
not to be forgotten.
The week, with Richard -Mansfield
in repertoire at "the Columbia Theater,
has been an epoch in local dramatic
annals. Four plays, the tragedy of
Count Alexis Tolstoi, new here â "Ivan
the Terrible"; the charming romance,
"Old Heidelberg," also new locally;"A
Parisian Romance," in which Mr.
Mansfield made his first mark on the
dramatic world, and "Beau Brummel,"
the ever delightful, have been given.
The programme is an astonishing one.
This week's is as varied, with yet an
other play, another historic success of
the actor's, in "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde," to be put on for the only time
next Friday evening. The rest of the
week is programmed as follows: "Old
Heidelberg" on Monday and Thursday
evenings and at the Saturday matinee;
"Ivan the Terrible" on Tuesday and
Saturday evenings, and "Beau Brum
mel" on Wednesday evening.
It were difficult to say in which
phase the actor is found most
inspiring and most profoundly sugges
tive. As a single portrait, looking out
from a shadowy background, dark,
splendid, vague as that from which
some, of the Rembrandt figures start
forth, the actor's Ivan the Terrible
dominates the view.

"In wha^t roles chiefly?"
"Elsa, Marguerite, in Mignonâ I
think I did something perhaps un
precedented as ElsÂ£," she exclaimed.
Then, turning her eyes on Mrs. Curtis,
she asked, "My eyes are all right? You
are a perfect dear! Would you rather
hold my grease-paint or act Camille?"
Mrs. Curtis laughingly decided that
she would prefer to change her-Camllle
costume six times in one evening
to holding a grease-paint cauldron over
a candle for fifteen minutes, even for
Madame Slapoffski.
"But Elsa, Madame?" I reminded the
little lady, as with a sigh she decided
that her eyes were sufficiently deco
rated.
"Oh, yes! Can you imagine," she ask
ed me then, "being asked to take the
role cf Elsa at half-past one of the day
on which you first sung it? I did that.
Mr. Musgrove's prima donna fell ill,
and he requested me to take her place.
I knew the part except the last act,
but I had to learn that, to sing with a
tenor I did not know, and without any
rehearsal, and the performance went
without a hitch. Xo one sang Elsa af
ter that but me."
"That is truly remarkable," I heartily
agreed. "And Marguerite must have
been one of your favorite parts?" I
remembered the singer's excellent
"Jewel Song" of the week, and her al
most painful self-denial in the way of
acting the part as she sang.
"I love it," she told me. "I love all
grand opera. I'm only fully alive when
I'm singing in it. Yes, Marguerite is
one of my favorite parts â oh, I must
show you something."
Reverently she then took from her
trunk a small coral cross, finger length.
"That belonged once to the famous
Vestris," she told me. "A woman who
heard my Marguerite and liked it went
home and sent this to me. Wasn't she
splendid?"
I took the little relic and saw, pin
scratchpd on the back, "Vestris, Pales-
tine, 1840." ,
"It is my talisman," the singer said
naively. "J never sing without it."
We returned then by way of "Lohen
grin" to Wajrner/in Australia. The
sinerer told me that they had stood for
eleven performances of "Lohengrin" in
three weeks in Melbourne, and that
they much prefer "Lohengrin" to
"Tannhauser." She added, "If we did
'Lohengrin* six times in a season of
forty-two weeks in England we thought
it extraordinary â which shows how far
in advance of England Australia is in
musical appreciation."
"They haven't done anything yet In
the way of production, creative art,
have they?" I inquired. The Aus
tralian silence in the art world has
often puzzled me.
â¢ "Xo â o." Madame could think of
only one artist â whose name she could
not remember. "But they are excep
tionally appreciative." â¢
"You have no reason to complain of
American appreciation so far "
"Indeed no," the singer agreed. "If
they are as good to me everywhere
else as here, I shall be more than
pleased."
"You think of staying?"
"For some time, yes, and " the
brown eyes wandered in tell-tale fash
ion to a photograph almost at her
elbow on the table, clean-shaven, good
humored, a man â of course.
"Monsieur Slapoffski?"
She nodded. "It's the first time we
have been separated. We don't like
it. He is coming as coon as he has
fulfilled his contracts there "
" 'He' is?"
"A musical director," madame smiled;
"I think the greatest in the world!"
"Of course." I sympathized. "But
how are you going to get him over
here? Won't he have to be smuggled?
The name! The Japanese warships
patrolling the Pacific "
Madame Slapoffski laughed, and told
me that her other half was a good
Englishman, of Russian descent, and
very proud â as she was â of their
unique patronymic.
Another photograph stood near Mr.
Slapoffski's, a face familiar, though un
familiarly posed. Suddenly, however,
I recognized Melba, and saw the legend
"To Mme. Slapoffski, from hers sincere
â¢ly, Nellie Melba."
"You know her?" I asked, unneces
sarily.
â¢ "Very well," the other prima donna
replied. "I like her. They're very
proud of her down there â tear the roof
off for her. So they should."
"I have heard other word as to her
popularity in her native land," I ven
tured, "how is that?"
"Oh, a lot of people don't like her be
cause s-he is abrupt," Glapoffski ex
plained. "She says right out what she
means. Perhaps it is because I do, too,
that I like her so much. But they all
admire her singing. How could they
help?"
"How could they?" I echoed. "With
whom did you study, madame?" I asked
determined then' to get at the growers
of that great voice planted in the ethe
real little figure that was now slipping
into a pale blue silken "confection" be
fore me.
"With Madame Haigh-Dyer for five
years, with Manuel Garcia for two,"
she replied.
"Oh!" I said, satisfied. "With Pat
ti's teacher for two years, eh? But
Ktlll I cannot understand where It all
comes from."
"Here," madame laughed, pointing
at her full upper chest. "You never
get much voice without the 'pigeon
chest.' A full development below may
disguise the fact that you are pigeon
chested, but it is always there. A
"But you're very stingy with them,"
madame retorted. Add to the brown
eyes, shining hair, clean, eager chin
â¢that I have so far given her. a nrnv
rather thin-lipped mouth. "You have
so many, the shops and gardens are
full of them, yet I have had hardly
any sent to me since I came."
"That is just it, madame," I de-
"We have flowers here," I began,
expecting the usual compliment to our
floral riches.
"But, madame," I exclaimed.
It -was in the tin-lined dressing-room
cf the "greatest English pnma donna,"
;Mme. Slapoffski. at the Orpheum. The
sacrfd door had opened to me and I
was on the threshold. A little figure of
five feet two, built on me slightest
lines, draped in a straight, scant, pink
Japanese kimona, ww holding out a
small hand to me.
"And this Is Mme. Slapoffski?" upon'
ir.y honor 1 did not say the name any
oftener than I had to. But she was an
impossible sort of surprise at close
range. I had fitted, even with the lady
before me â though from the glamour
side of the footlights â that voice ex
traordinary, that human syren, with an
envelope sufficiently capacious to hold
it. I was wondering wild*ly where the
rest of madame was.
"This is Mrre. Slapoffski," the little
lady confirmed, with no evidence of
abnormal volume in her gentle voice.
"Won't you sit down? I'm Just doing
up my eyes."
I was glad to sit down. Brought up
Â«m the doctrine that all flesh is voice,
it was a shock to have one's faith shat
tered in a single, exiguous instant. But
conversation must be made in an in
terview and I began to make 6ome.
"You are Just here from Australia,
Madame, they tell me," I began, taking
in the clean, eager line of the profile
chin she gave me, the slim, girlish
neck, the little astonishing, alert fig
ure.
"From Australia," she echoed cozily,
"but permit me, Mrs. Curtis."
I became cognizant then of an ex
ceedingly kind pair of gray eyes in a
pleasant, round face that lc-oked at me
. over madame's shoulder.
â¢You will know Mrs. Curtis â Albina
<!â¢' Maire â one of your famous Ca
rnilles." Slapoffskf continued, "and Mr.
Â«'urtis â "
"Not Samuel of Posen?"
"Samuel of P<"sen." the singer con
firmed. "Mr. Curtis is my manager.
"Mrs. <"urtis â "
*"IÂ«b at present your maid." that lady
laushtd. She was holding a mysterious
# black bubbling concoction over the can
dle like a pood-natured witch. It was
with this with which madame was
heading the lashes that shade her
hriprht. brown eyes. "Her maid is ill,"
Mrs. Curtis further explained, "ton
" Filitis. and we feared the infection,"
"Your San Francisco is not good for
. throats." madame advanced.
"Can it affect yours?" I asked in
-rreduously. The capacity of the San
Francisco climate had never before
loomed so larpe.
"Indeed yes," the owner of the throat
in Question returned. "I had quite a
had throat for ten days after coming
here. But I've found something won
derful. That." â and she jerked a little
thumb in the direction of a plate that
held two sugared halves of Juicy grape
fruit. "It's a natural tonic. It tones the
relaxed vocal chords immediately. Mr.
Curtis has made arrangements for me
To have it all the time."
Grape-fruit men, the tip is yours.
"Is this your first visit to America,
madame." I asked by the book.
"My first. I've boon here four weeks
only," the singer replied. "I like it.
I tell you what. I like your women.
â¢I think they're the finest in the world.
They're good to one another. If you
have on anything pretty they choose
that to talk about. If you've done well,
they tell you so."
"You are English, madame?"
She laughed comprehendinsly and
said: "1 don't v ish to run down my
own countrywomen, but they are com
paratively jealous, ungenerous, in this
professionâ a profession in which jeal
ousy flourishes, by the way. Do they
say you look nice if you do? Nay.
*Th<=y look over you this way â " in a
moment her little finger nail was jeal
ously bitten between thin lips, and a
* hard, cold, critical eye turned my way.
'You always feel you'd better have
I'Ut something else on. bought anything
els<S been anything else." Her tone
was not exactly bitter, but edged cer
tainly.
"And Australia?"
"Oh. it's much the same there," and
Slapoffski returned with regained good
humor to her work of framing her
eyes. "But Australia is very fascinating?
Â«m excellent field for one of this pro-'
fession."
"You dor.'t mean vaudevilleâ this is
your first appearance in variety, is it
not?"
The Finger nodded her shining brown
head as she replied affirmatively. "No;
I wa.s only in grand and light opera
there."
"And in England with the Carl Rosa
Opera Company for nine years?"
"Yes."
"And in much oratorio?"
" "Also, yes," she laughed. "And in
concert, too. I've done almost every
thing. I was in 'The Fortune Teller*
for a long time in Australia. Do you
know. I think it fit to rajik with 'Die
Fledfrmaus,' 'Daughter of the Regi
ment' and such-like operas?"
"You do? I havn't heard vou in it
yet. madame."
"It had a great vogue in Australia,"
{-.he said then. "We did it in Melbourne
foV twelve weeks, in Sydney for an
other ten, then returned to sing it for
another twelve weeks in Melbourne."
"You have a great many good things
theatrical in Australia, I understand?"
"If they're not pood it is of no use
to take them there," Slapoffski put it.
"The people are very critical, but also
very generous in their support o* good
things. And if they like you, my! they
can't do enough for you! They deluge
you with flowers." Here madame's
gaze flew over to a stately bouquet of
roses, red and white, that graced the
Jons table, with its powder, grease
paint, pots, cans and tubes of complex
ion scattered about.

developed muscles at her waist.
I nodded, then askeo 1 : "Was Garcia
fond of talking about Patti?"
"Just occasionally. He was very
proud of her," Slapoffski testified.
"Just think of the dear old man, 100
years old the other day â Mallbran his
sister, Patti his pupil, Marches! his pu
pil. Such a history." As she spoke, 1 the
singer gravely slipped the cross of Ves

Apropos to the unrest in the Presidio
in the matter of recent upheavals in
volving men of supposedly high honor
much has been said. Why, pray, should
higher standards be looked for in army
circles than amonsr gentlemen in civil
life? Men high in civil life have at
times made moral mistakes and no
vast amount of shock was expressed,
save by those , associated with them.
But in the army a breach of honor or
trust is fatalâ not only among the of
ficers, with whom the affair is neces
sarily a matter of discipline, but among
civilians as well. Relative to the late
frequency of army and honor breaches
at the Pre?idio the officers are almost
a unit in declaring the trouble the out
growth of the "crime of '96," when men
strong In influence, but weak in char
acter, were awarded commissions and
since brought disgrace to the service.
But whatever of small shadows the
Presidio has cast upon the social hori
zon its contributions to the social life
of the city is Immeasurable. Its women,
while not noted for their beauty or-dis
tinctiveness of style, are cultured and
charming, and its menâ well, Cupid
Danforth can testify to their charm!
Distinctly we need the Presidio! What
would the Fortnicntlies or the Assem
blies, the Mardi Gras or even our lesser
functions be without the gallant chaps
with shoulder straps?

The week has not been a "radiant
round of pleasure," as Cholly Knicker
bocker puts it. It barely escaped being
stupid through the angelic agency of
bridge, Mr. Mansfield and the com
mencement exercises of Berkeley and
Stanford. Hundreds from town at
tended the two big days, class-day and

Ah! What life, what effervescence,
what hope was abroad in the air! Such
scenes as these invigorate. The physi
cal buoyancy of those young men and
women was a tonic' proving again â
if proof be neededâ that the exuber
ance of vouth is the most blessed gift
of God. And therefore let us be
patient 'with the roystering extrava
gances of the college lad or maidâ they
are theirs only while they linger in the
flowered groves of youth.

fetching gowns were seen.

The senior dance of Stanford at San

affair. The co-eds were fetching ill
their diaphanous 'frocks, and many
memories will be treasured of the last
blessed two-step.
Berkeley was busy this week. The
Omega Chapter of the,Beta Theta Pi
fraternity gave a dinner on Monday
night to twenty convivial spirits and
later entertained more than 100 at a
dance. At frat dances there are not
many dull moments, and this, the last
of the semester, was exceptionally spir

youth.

An army post springing up out of
the sands of the desert, or out from
grassy r^ains. or down in the shadow
of a frowning canyon, there within the
Rttle citadel, a life wholly apart from
soldier-duty takes its rise. The post
soon becomes the Paris of the eircum
ecrtfjed locality. It becomes the hub
of the trails and wagonroads of the
wilderness, and within its domain is
Jound whatever of culture and well
bred association that survives isola
.tion. It is therefore the Edenic spot
where many pledges are plighted, and
many hearts made one â O. yes, pro
pinquity. Â«.f course. Wise? Sometimes.
<= In outlying posts the officers become
Brummrlsâ there are no rivals on the
ltsts. ThÂ«- social life of the whole reg
ior^ centers in them, and they are the
heroes. It is this atmosphere of com J 
fanionship that makes the isolation of
the post endurable, and renders the
soWier's patriotism less liable to get
â¢weak in the knees. And what a joy it
is to the stockman's daughter, 6r the
lonely schoolma'am. or even the post
tradft's blue-eyed lass?
. But what of the city with an army
â¢ pos"t at its elbow? Is the Impression
upon society so marked as without the
Â¦pale of cities? Hardly. In the outpost
the fort is the formative power. It
creates, nourishes and perpetuatesâ or
killsâ the social life of its environment.
In the cityâ as in our own â the post is
but a formative factor, but a factor
that figures largely out of proportion
to civic influences. And the reasons
"are not hard to find. Army men â and
it's the m<-n who really figure in civil
societyâ are. ay a class, a cultivated,
well-groomed, well-disciplined and
wholly interesting cJass of fellows, in
whom the social qualities have been
well d>?v*-IopÂ«-.(j. and having ample time
for social duties, and a cultivation of
interesting friendships, it is small won
dÂ«r that they are capturing the fairest
prizes in our mart of pretty maidens â
just look at the record of last winter,
and the nnrnming summer, and judge
for yourself whether the presence of
the army r.nst nan borne any Influence
pn civic social life.
Say what you will, my pretty maid
yea, and my handsome dame â those
stunning soldier-men are charming â
most of th^mâ and a frank confession,
nhich is good for us all. will reveal the
fact that, al! things being equal, the
son of Mars has decMr-dly the best of
the guest, and therefore his successful
suit.. Ah! that we M-knit figure In blue
and brass is captivating.
And aside from the fascinating sub
ject of matrimony, the post contributes
a distinct phase of entertainment for
the from town girls. Now, it is said
that the army girls have no vast love
for the town girls, who usually out
dress thf-m and generally outshine
them in dash and spirit and a few
other thirds that mon condemn in their
sisters, but like awfully well in their
friend?, and the army girl really as
sumes a spirit of supremacyâ being an
army girlâ over her rival from
town. But usually the town girl wins.
Of course, there is the clement of
finance figuring largely in the game of
hearts. Many of the most charming

depending entirely upon the stipend â

And marriage with an army girl, with
equal prospects of financial barrenness,
would be a series of hardships and
debt-wrestles for both. And from this
the young officer shrinks â and wisely.

What a delightful affair that con

She gave two songs of Oscar Weil's

one, however, coming v v ery near to
grief. The singer had Just begun the
ballad "O. Take Those Lips Away,"
when a couple of dogs fell to disputing
out in the alley and almost drowned
the melody within. So violent did
their arguments become that the fair
singer was compelled to cease until
the dogs had been sent hence, causing
a wicked man near by to paraphrase
the lovely lyric to "Oh, Take those
Dogs Away," which caused an un
seemly titter. The patronesses were:

The engagement of Miss Blanche
Tisdale. daughter of Mrs. W. de Witt
Tisdale, to Charles Peter Weeks, the
architect, caused a general ripple in so
ciety circles here and in San Jose, the
young woman having ma*de her home
in the Garden City since her child
hood.
Miss Tisdale is an attractive maiden,
petite, pretty and clever. As a horse
woman she has won many laurels and
can be seen daily, cantering out to the
park with her fiance, who is himself
something of a horse lover. .
Mr. Weeks ranks high among the
architects of the city and is pos
sessed of many social qualities. Miss
Tisdale's elder sister, Mrs. Edgar/ R.
Bryant, was a belle of San Jose before
her marriage to Dr. Bryant.

The attentions of the young cleric to
the' young niece of Maye Newhall were
marked, and an announcement was
looked for before the party started for
Europe. But as the doctor accompanies
the pretty little maid, perhaps the news
of acceptance may come to us by
cable.-
Speaking of Newhalls, what a time
of it Miss Margaret has been having
at Los Angeles. Among those whd en
tertained her' in the south were her
aunt, Mrs. Walter Newhall, Mrs. M. J.
Connell, Miss Grace Mellus, Miss Mary

were two Lochinvars who. lingered

The present week has (brought the
first real worry regarding the probable
outcome* of the campaign in the Mid-,
die West to the President's advisers.
This came about through the bitter
contest In the Illinois State Convention
over the Governorship, resulting In a
deadlock and an adjournment until
May 31 without a nomination, and the
factional struggle in Wisconsin, re
sulting in a bolt and the nomination
of two State tickets. Wisconsin gave
McKinley more than 100,000 plurality
both time3 he ran. It gave Governor
La Follette more than 17,000 .plurality
over Rose in 1902,. and even then the
factional fight, which has since grown
into a great conflagration, was burn
ing fiercely.
In Illinois the convention, after bal
loting, fruitlessly for seven days, de
clared a truce and adjourned for a ten
days' rest." Efforts are now being
made, to arrive at a compromise. 'It is
"believed that If any one of the three
candidates gets the nomination there
will be a bolt by the friends of the
other two and a second and possibly
a third Republican State ticket in the

surprise and some satisfaction, as
every day's postponement of a decisive

is supposed that the recent rains ham

halt. The Russians still hold the rail

Satisfaction Is expressed at the ex

sixteen of these boats went out in the
attempt to destroy other Japanese
ships. The haste with which the Rus
sian protected cruiser Novik put to
sea to support the smaller craft is
pointed to by the authorities as show
ing that not only is the harbor entrance
clear, but that Admiral Wittsoeft is
convinced that he has taken up all the
mines laid by the Japanese. A report
from Wittsoeft some days ago an
nounced that he had exploded three
Japanese mines.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 21.â The
Government to-day received 'newe con
firmatory of the rumors In circulation
_here that General Stoessel has made a
successful fcortie frcm Port Arthur, re
. suiting in the defeat of the Japanese,
with the loss of more than 1000 killed
or wounded. The /Russian losses were
115 killed or â¢wounded.
. The movement was carried out by a
combination with a train bringing in
.war munitions and supplies and Gen
eral Stoessel's force, communication
being maintained by wireless telegra
phy. The Japanese barred the route
between the train .and General Stoes
eel's force, whereupon the Russians at
tacked and routed the Japanese. After
the engagement General Sloessel's
force, together with the train, returned
to Port Arthur.
. General Stoessel, it is said, made a
new distribution of his guns before
taking part In the sortie. The Russian
,Â«.rocps fought with great bravery,
breaking the Japanese line and carry
ing the enemy u. considerable distance.
The general staff has received a mes
sage from General Stoessel giving his
account of the fight north of Kinchou
on Monday last. Three Russian regi
ments were attacked by two Japanese
divisions, with four batteries of artil
lery. The Russians lost 160 men in
killed or wounded. Including an ofScer
killed and Brigadier General Nadein
slightly wounded. The Japanese losses
are not known, but it is believed they
were heavy. The enemy's advance on
Kinchou was arrested.
The general Ftaff ascertains that this
attack on the Russian troops was ar
ranged to take place simultaneously
with a landing of Japanese troops in
Kerr Bay. which was unsuccessful
owing to a number of Russian mines
there. The general staff expects to
hear of another stubborn fight at Kin
.chou. The landing of a Japanese force
to Caiik Kinchou will be exceedingly
â¢ difficult, and the waters of Talienwan
â¢ liay are too shallow to permit a de
barkation of troops.
The general staff says the whole re
gion northwest ' of Yengwangcheng Is
clear of Japanese and that reinforce
ments are daily arriving at Llaoyang.
The statement from Newchwang that
â¢ there Is telegraphic communication be
tween that town and Port Arthur is
cot believed by the general staff to be
correct. All messages from Port Ar
"thur are brought north by runners.
Details of Rear Admiral Wittsoeft's
Â» mall dispatch to Viceroy Alexieff
(transmited by telegraph to-day to
High Admiral Grand ' Duke Alexis),
.which was not made public, establish
the fact that* mines planted by the
Russian ton>ecto-Doa.ts were responsible
for the destruction of the Hatsnse and
the damastr sustained by other battle
ships of ihc Fuji tyne off Port Arthur.
It Is said that no submarine boats were
sent out of Port Arthur. The suppres
sion of the statement regarding the
mines was due to the fact that it ex
plained vvhti e they were located. A
number cf unesrÂ»loded mines lie in the
tii!:.'- vicinity, and it is not deemed
wise to describe their position. Each
mine contained seventy-four pounds of
gTincotton.

â¢WASHINGTON. May 2Lâ At to-day's

the various processes of isolating pre
cious metals, with the result that over
$0000 worth of valuables have been re
covered. Among the souvenirs are va

gots which melted in the fire. The
pearls and emeralds in Mrs. Turner's
collection of gems were lost, with vari
ous other ornaments, and there are still
thirty-two diamonds missing.
The insurance on the building and
furniture amounted to $6500, leaving a
net loss, exclusive of jewels, of about
$11,000. Mr. Turner has decided to re
build immediately a more stately and
commodious mansion than that which
was destroyed. The family is now re
siding in one of his cottages on Oak

LOS ANGELES, May 21.â When the
Methodist General Conference finished
its third week's labors at noon to-day
and adjourned until next Monday it
had elected eight Bishops, the number
recommended by the episcopacy com
mittee, and disposed of the majority of
the important rubjects that have come
up for consideration.
Ten days more remain in which to
complete its business. Subjects yet to
be passed upon are the election of four
additional missionary Bishops, the re
sult of the first ballot for which will
be anonunced Monday morning; the
election of General Conference officers
for the next quadrennlum; action upon
the important problems of denomina
tional and general interest, as follows:
Amusements, divorce, consolidation of
book concerns, polygamy, temperance
and the relation of capital and labor.
Dr. J. R. Day, chancellor of the Syra
cuse, N. Y., University, was the eighth
and last Bishop chosen. His election
was effected on the fourteenth ballot,
the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth
being ineffectual. On the twelfth ballot
Dr. R. J. Cook of Tennessee, Dr. Day's
nearest competitor, withdrew from the
race, and from that time on Dr. Day
Increased his lead and finally was elect
ed on the fourteenth ballot by a vote
of 474 of the â¬96 ballots cast. Dr. W.
A- Quayle of Kansas City was the sec
ond highest candidate on the last bal
lot, receiving ISO votes.
NEW SrETHODIST BISHOPS.
The complete list of new Bishops,
chosen in the order named, is as fol
lows: Joseph F. Berry, Chicago; Henry
F. Epellmeyer, Newark, N. J.; William
F. McDowell, New York; James W.
Bashford, Delaware, Ohio: W. A. Burt,
Rome, Italy; Luther B. Wilson, Balti
more. Md.; Thomas B. Neely, Phlladel-
One of the features of to-day's ses
sion was the appearance of the . first
colored woman who ever addressed a
Methodist General Conference, Mrs.
Emma T. Strickland of Little Rock,
Ark., who made an eloquent plea for
representation of the colored race upon
the episcopal board. She presented res
olutions asking that the episcopacy
committee be Instructed to consider the
advisability of the election of a negro
Bishop. She was given respectful at
tention and her resolution was referred
to the committee on episcopacy.
The conference then proceeded to bal
lot for missionary Bishops. A ballot
was first taken for an additional mis
sionary Bishop for Africa, and* another
and separate one for two additional
missionary Bishops for Southern Asia.
The result of these ballots will be an
nounced next Monday morning. It Is
almost a foregone conclusion, in the
opinion of well-posted delegates, that
the Rev. A. P. Camphor of Monrovia,
Liberia, will be chosen for Africa, and
the Rev. W. F. Oldham of Chicago and
the Rev. J., E. Robinson, editor of the
Indian Witness, Calcutta, India, will be
the successful candidates for the two
places In Southern Asia. v-
The conference accepted an Invita
tion to visit Long Beach in a body this
afternoon, where. they were entertained
by the citizens of that city.

phia, and J. R. Day, Syracuse, N. Y.
"With the exception of Bishops Berry,
Burt and Neely the newly elected mem
bers of the episcopal board are young
men, ranging between the ages of 42
and 48 years.
The conference to-day finally disposed
of the question as to whether the Meth
odist church would return to the rule
of limiting, the tenure of pastors by
adopting the majority report of the
committee on itinerancy. This report
recommends that no change be made
in the rule adopted four years ago,
which provides for an unlimited tenure.
A minority report from the committee
was offered providing for a time limit
of five years and giving the Bishops
certain discretionary powers in special
cases, but it was overwhelmingly de
feated.
AUBURN, May 2Lâ Recent dispatches
regarding changes made in salaries of
certain Government officials in interior
towns of the State have occasioned
considerable comment here. * It was
stated that the salary of the Postmas
ter in Auburn had been, reduced from
$2000 to 51700. . .''. Â¦-
The explanation of this change is
found In the fact that about a year ago
the department at Washington estab
lished a second postofflce within the
city limits of Auburn to be known as
"East Auburn." The result of this ac
tion is that the gross receipts of the
Auburn postoffice were decreased about
one-fourth, which, of course, compels
the reduction of salary as stated.
Doubtless a computation of the receipts
of both offices would show a good,
healthy increase in the volume of busi
ness in this city. During the year past
cement sidewalks have been made, the
sewer system extended, large improve
ments are in progress on the Court
house square and many other evi
dences have been given of the con
tinued growth and increased vitality
of the city.

REDDING, May 21. â j The self -accused
firebug who burned the Terry Lumber
Company's yards In this city early yes
terday mornlns now occupies a cell, in
the County Jail and is awaiting either j
an examination for insanity or a com- j
plaint charging him with arson. i
Paul Frederick Clifford, aged 40 years, j
mounted the courthouse steps this
morning at 8 o'clock, walked, into the <
Sheriff's office, took off his cap and told j
Under Sheriff Behrens that he was the !
man who set fire to the Terry lumber!
yard. He wanted to be put in jail, and '
he was accommodated. He said the )
reason he burned the lumber yard was j
to attract the police to the north end Â¦
of town so that he could rob the Bank j
of Northern California.
Clifford says he arrived in Redding
Wednesday night from Portland. He
had only $1 25 and needed money bad
ly. He was not particular about
working, so decided to do a little work
at burglary, which avocation he says
he has followed before with more or i
less success. Thursday Clifford spent in !
a survey of Reddlng's business center.'
He examined several stores, both of the j
banks and some saloons. He finally de- I
elded that he could do more profitable :
business at the Bank of Northern Call- j
fornia fnan anywhere else. â¢ x
After deciding that the bank was the|
place for him to operate, Clifford set j
about to devise means of attracting ;
the attention of the police to another j
part of town, and while studying over j
these plans he hit upon the scheme that '
finally resulted in the destruction of j
about $20,000 worth of the Terry Lum- i
ber Company's property. After starting J
the fire, he says, he. ran up the track,!
fell in a ditch and lost his bag of tools, i
He could not find them, was crippled
and decided to give himself up. The
District Attorney will prosecute Clif
ford. /*

There Is no telegraph communica

there believes that part of the force

past.
- The Gensan garrison, which consists
of a battalion infantry, will not take
the initiative, but will await an at
tack, which is not expected. -
The Japanese authorities are in

KOREAN TROOPS IN FIGHT.
NEWCHWANG, May 21. â The offi
cials have not received any further in
formation regarding the fighting
which resulted in the retreat of the
Japanese on Fengwangcheng, but
there is good authority for sa3'ing that
the Japanese movements in the direc
tion of Liaoyang-and Haicheng were
for the purpose of causing the Rus
sians in the vicinity to move north
ward, thus giving the Japanese an op
portunity to complete their prepara
tions to capture Port Arthur. When
the Japanese begin a determined
movement in this vicinity it will be
from Fengwangcheng and New
chwang. They figure that it does not
matter what may be the fate of the
Yalu army if they can continue to
control the sea and Port Arthur.
The Japanese are still fortifying the
hills on the neck of land between
Tallenwan and Kinchou bays. Many
rapid-fire guns protected by sandbags
have been mounted there with the ob
ject of resisting a sortie by the be

Tho review of the troops, held at the
station on account of the pressure for
time, was exceedingly brief. The Czar's
trip through the ancient capital, which
he much prefers to St. Petersburg, was
almost in the nature of a triumphal
procession. The streets were gayly
decorated and the sidewalks were
erowik-d with people whose acclama
tions almost drowned the clang of the
bells of Moscow's 500 churches. No es
oort of troons accompanied the Czar,
who sat in nn open carriage.
Inside tho Kremlin were no troops
except the rPKtilnr sentinels. Ills Maj
esty did not visit the lmxwrial palace,
but drove rapidly across the terrace
Which overlooks the shining city and
the ilver llowinjj at its base. Just be
yond tho Petit Palace, where his
grandfather was born; the Cr.ar and
his suite alighted '. and entered the
Church of the Assumption."" After a
ta dcum had been sung the Czar knelt
on the Identical spot where he received
tho crown of his father under the colos-j
sal Imago of God painted in the cupola,
and there, amid ,.iocense burning,
prayed for victory for' the Russian
army and received the blessing of the
Metropolitan. Then he arose and moved
reverently forward and kissed the
linage of the -Virgin which Vladimir
brought to Moscow to protect the city
on" the approach of the yellow horror.
The Czar received the news of the
destruction of the Japanese ships while
at Toula. He expressed sorrow at the
death of so many brave men. The
whole war to htm is a regrettable oc
currence for which he feels that Russia
is not responsible.
MOSCOW, Mav 21.â The Czar's 2000
nille Journey through' Russia ended at
Moscow this afternoon with a review
of several sapper and engineer battal
ions In the courtyard of the Nicholas
Statue and a hurried visit to the shrine
of the Iberian virgin and the church in
tho Kremlin, where he was crowned^
The Czar was met at Moscow with
the same patriotic demonstrations that
have marked the whole progress of his
trip. Ho seemed to bo in high spirits
and was pleased with the temper mani
fested by tho people, as well as by the
appearance and morale of the two
corps which he was Bonding to.reln
forco General Kuropatkln. Besides,
Binco his Majesty left St. Petersburg
a week ago, the news from the front
has been very reassuring. General Ku
ropatkln evidently believes that the
turning point of the campaign is close
at hand, the wide territory over which
the enemy is operating and his own
concentration giving him a distinct ad
vantage.

It was not until ten days later that
Foster had occasion to become uneasy
over his wife's trip to Massachusetts.
She wrote to him, - he says, that, she
did not intend to return home, adding
that she had discharged the, nurse, and
that the latter probably would inform
him -, why she had taken that step.
'The Fosters are prominent in society

Foster cave out a statement as fol

Park to-day to make the final ar
rangements for the annual gathering
and games to be held on Monday, May
20. The gratherlng is attracting: more
than usual interest this year from the
fact that there are new events on the
programme, including wrestling, and
that new competitors will be present
â¢from various cities in adjoining States.
It Is expected that Jack Munroe.
â¢who will fight James Jeffries for the
world's heavy- weight championship,
will visit the games and may compete
in the hammer throwing and other
heavy events, at which he is an adept.
The club has appropriated a liberal
sum this year for entertaining the
guests, who will as heretofore receive
a genuine Highland welcome. A rÂ«-*
ception committee headed by First
Chieftain S. McGregor will see that
this part of the programme is carried
out to the satisfaction of everybody.

One hundred and fifty houses in the
Russian settlement at the sugar fac
tory north of here were destroyed. So
far as ascertained only one life was
lost here. Six bridges .were washed
out between Livermore and Fort Col
lins and traffic is suspended. The flood
receded rapidly at this point to-day,
but it is believed that several reser
voirs are unsafe, and ehould any of
these go out much further damage
will ensue.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., May 21.âEs
tSmates cf the damage caused by the
â¢flood in the Cache La Poudre Valley
last night run from $1,000,000 upward.
The "headgates of all the irrigating
ditches have been washed out and miles
of embankments destroyed. Unless re
â¢pairs can be made in time to save
water for irrigation this year the loss
v.ill be nearer $2,000,000 than $1,000,000.
. Dozens of bridges were washed out
between Greetey and Windsor and be
tween Fort Collins and Livermore. The
railroad bridge north of Greeley is
still standing, but for a distance of 100
rods the embankment under the Union
.Pacific tracks are washed out. leaving
the rails without support. Mall com
munication between Windsor anQ out
side points is entirely cut off.
The Colorado Southern management
.announces that it will be Tuesday or
Wednesday before traffic can be re
sumed, owing to the damage done to
tfce tracks.
No estimate of the damage done
<-rops can be made until the water goes
down, but if it continues to fall at the
present rate part of them may be
"taved.

is known, is Robert Strouse, who was
drowned near Tingmat. A number
of peopfe are missing, and owing to the
condition of the roads and washing out
of bridges it is impossible as yet to
ascertain whether or not they lost

A soldier named William Pluss fell
through a shop window in Chinatown
and was roundly abused by the Celes

over to the military authorities for pun

half a year's deprivation of liberty to
leave the military reservation..' The
complaining policeman was willing and
the court so ordered.
"I would give you six months, Mr.
Roach," said Judge Mogan, "only "I'm.
afraid that before half that period has
expired the anger of this little woman
will yield to hunger and she will ask
for your release. But you might as

On Natoma street, in the 400 block,
it was that Peter McGrath disturbed
the domestic amenities by casting a

wife, Rebecca, because she declined to
give him the pecuniary rewards of her

of that kind for which Peter had been
arrested, and it was probably the in

Judge Mogan on his second appearance
that prompted him yesterday to request
a jury trial. He will get it, and the
date is to be set next Tuesday.

It was explained to Judge Cabanisa
that the defendant had been discussing

more thoroughly he became convinced
that It was his duty to slay as many

The case is under judicial advisement.

It to scorn. â¢
"How could I have disturbed the
peaco," he asked, "with two men ham
mering each- othpr in the ring and the
crowd yelling like a band of Indians?"
The Judgt> pronounced him guilty of
disturbing the peace by insisting on
escorting some of hla ticketless friends
into the pavilion.
Walsh's penitential mood suddenly
pave way to unseeming anger, but he
discreetly gulped it.
Then he glanced narrowly at the
countenance of the^ court to see if his
words and manner' had created a fa
vorable impression.
" 'Tis even as you say," was the re
sponse. "In this department we deal
above the board and never shift the
cut. As to curing the whisky habit,
my recommendation is not backed by
personal experience. It is that you do
not try to indulge in surreptitious tip
pling during the thirty days you are
now sentenced to spend in the County
Jail."
"Because," he explained, "I know
that if a square deal is to be obtained
in this Hall of Justice I'm in the right
shop to get it. It's true I was drunk,
and I'm glad of this opportunity to ask
fof your advice. What would you rec
ommend as a cure for the whisky
habit?"
M. J. Walsh smiled kindly upon
Judge Cabaniss and expressed pleasure
at meeting him again.
His Honor ignored the proposal and
took Mr. Piper's case under advisement.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Los Angeles visitors are greatly
pleased with the fine exhibit of their
county and those of the others south
of Tehachapl. The Immense walnuts
shown by Los Angeles attract as much
attention as anything else in her va
ried display; Everything has been ar
ranged with an artistic skill and beau
ty of design that have .brought many
compliments to Commissioner Wiggins
and Charles Wilson, his assistant, who
havÂ« paid particular attention to this
installation. They are old hands at the
business, and invaluable to the Los
Angeles" boomers. They never lose their
skill in this line, for, like the politi;
clan, Los Angeles never closes one cam
paign but she begins the next. When
one exposition ends she is framing her
plans for the one to come and the-re
sult is always a rich and. beautiful dis
play, shown to the very best; advan
tage. Los Angeles was ready when the
fair opened, because -experience; -had
taught those having her: interests in
charge to begin early, and with .plans
worked out to the last mural peanut.'/
, The; facade of the Los Angeles'ex
hibit is constructed^ so as to -exactly
match that: of the entire California sec-
dow sillâ but you must give us some
thing so we can register by ourselves."
She also said that the fact that there
would be a resister fpr Stanford at the
California building had already been
published in the Stanford paper and
that after that the commissioners Just
couldn't deny her request.
Filcher gave in and wrote Miss Alla
bach that he would provide' for Stan
ford. The California building has the
card system of registration, the visi
tors* cards, containing names and ad
dresses being dropped in lettered draw
ers. Commissioner Filcher will reserve
one drawer for Stanford.
LOS ANGELES DISPLAY. -
BUTTE, Mont., May 21.â In a miser
able hovel on South .Arizona street,
Mrs. John Kelly, wife of a former
prominent Alderman of Butte, lies
dying. For days Mrs. Kelly has lain
in the little shanty that she calls home
without food, money or friends.
The police to-day found her moaning
with pain and tossing on her little
rickety bed. Mrs. Kelly's recent illness
is due to a fight that she had with a
neighbor several days ago. She was hit
on the head with a broomstick and
was fatally Injured.
' Mrs. Kelly to-day is more than 60
year$ of age. Years ago she was con
sidered a belle and the center of life
in Butte when this city was but a rough
mining camp.' Her | husband was well
known to all of the oldtimers here.

tion, green background, peanut trim
mings, oranges and all. ; This causes
Los Angeles to blend harmoniously
with the State's part of the wprk and
gives a pretty effect.
Commissioner Wiggins is especially
proud of Mr. Wilson and the latter*s
skill at installation. "Why, I took him
off a farm ten years ago, and look at
what he can do now," said Wiggins
proudly one day to some visitors who
were admiring the exhibit. "He's a
genius." Â¦
Henry C. Keyes, treasurer and secre
tary of the Sacramento Natural Gas
Company; F. W. Keisel, cashier of the
California State Bank at Sacramento;
Ralph Lowe of San Jose, one of the
State Normal School trustees; E. F.
Mitchell of Fresno, journal clerk of the
United States Senate and whose mother
.conducts the Hotel Oliver in San Fran
cisco,, and Mrs. L. J. Harding of San
Francisco, are among the visitors to
the fair.
W. S. Melick of the State Board of
Examiners is here representing the
Governor and will make an inspection
of all State exhibits and the books of
the commission.
Stanford University is to have a sys
tem by which the alumnae may be
brought in touch at the World's Fair.
A special registration privilege at the
California building has been, secured
through the perseverance and energy
of Mies Lucy Allabach of Des Moines,
who simply would not be turned down.
She wrote to Commissioner Filcher,
making request for a desk and register
in the California building for Stan
ford. Filcher wrote her that he would
be pleased to accommodate her and
Stanford, but that if all the requests
for desks be granted there would be
no room in the building to permit vis
itors to get around and see the paint
ings. Miss Allabach' wrote back a note
of the "don't you dare to say no"
variety and said "Give us anything, a

STANFORD REGISTRATION.
Every day this week has been re
ception day at the California building,
Commissioners Wiggins and Filcher,
Secretary Willis, Mrs. Wiggins, Mrs.
Willis and Miss Pringle, stenographer
to the commission, being assisted in ex
tending cou/tesies by the wives of the
county commissioners, among the lat
ter being Mrs. Colvin B. Brown, Mrs.
W. H. Weilbye and Mrs. H. F. Ellis.
A search through the medium of the
telegraph is being made for six cabi
nets containing the work of pupils of
the Stockton public schools. These cabi
nets, like many other parts of exhibits
shipped to the fair, have gone astray
owing to the confusion that must exist
during the rush to get material to the
front. The failure of these cabinets to
arrive has caused a great deal of per
turbation on the part of Mr. Furlong,
in charge of California's educational
display, for they form one of the prin
cipal features of Stockton's exhibit,
which Mr. Furlong is greatly pleased
with. He says it is probably the best
of all the excellent educational displays
sent from California. The main fea
tures of the Stockton material are forty
bound volumes showing the work of the
pupils through the various grades, step
by step. Mr. Furlong is enthusiastic
enough to say that these volumes
form an invaluable addition to educa
tional literature. They also confain
forty monographs, pamphlets by teach
ers on simple subjects showing meth
ods employed.
ST. LOUIS, May 2Lâ The arrival dur
ing the week of tha State Board of

Ing the wonders, for they are energetic
sightseers and few things escape them,
even though their stay be brief. Cali
fornians, like the rest of the world,
will never learn that no universal ex
position is ready on its opening day,
nor perhaps for thirty days thereafter,
and consequently some of the Golden
State tourists were a little disappoint
ed, but there is enough as the fair
standsâ and it is nearer ready than any
other exposition has been the same
length of time after the openingâ to
hold the marveling attention of all.
Though they are not seeing all there
will be to see in two weeks more, the
Californians have about all they could
wish to entertain them.
Something of an unfortunate contre
temps, and one which caused the press
delegation a great deal of discomfort,
occurred upon its arrival at the Inside
Inn, where the visiting newspaper men (
were to stop. The inn management
claims the mistake was due to mislead
ing telegrams, but the journalists lay
the blame upon the inn people. E. B.
Willis, secretary of the California com- |
mission, who Is also secretary of the
Press Association, had contracted for
accommodations for eighty people at
the inn. When the newspaper party
arrived at the place there were no
rooms for them. Only a certain num
ber of apartments in the structure were
ready for occupancy. The rain was fall
ing and the press people didn't have a
cheerful prospect before them, but the
gentlemen in the party hustled and
soon secured accommodations down
town. Neither the cheerless reception
at the inn nor the falling rain could
dampen the ardor of the press repre
sentatives, and many of, them were
about the grounds during the afternoon
and night. '; Â«;,*

COMPLAINANTS WITHDRAW
CHARGE AGAINST RICHARDS
The trouble occurred on the ranch of
Andrew Nohle, a well-known stock
man, over the attempted seizure of a
horse bought by Nohle at a forced sale
from a man named Sanderson.
. Nohle with his hired man and San
derson with his brother-in-law drew
revolvers during the row and the firing
became general, Nohle being shot sev
eral times, though not. seriously. His
hired man, however, may die, being
shot through the abdomen and the
hips.
The trouble originally had its incep
tion over a land contest case, and the
feeling between the two stockmen had
become almost feudal in character.

TOPEKA. Knns., May 21.â Pupils of
the Kansac high schools will no longer
be taught that it v/as for swimming
the TJag Dap; River in the Philippines
and In the face of a hot fire from the
enemy that General Frederick Funs
ton wag promoted from colonel of vol
unteers to be a brigadier general in the
regular army.
A sub-committee of the State Text
book Commission has ordered the ac
count of ih<Â» incident expunged from
the history, which has been readopted
for use in the high schools for five
years. When General Funston was
promoted to the place he now holds
his commission declared in explicit
terms that his promotion was earned
by his action in swimming the Bag Bag
River in the face of a severe fire from
the enemy.
"We will Rive the credit to Private
Trembly White, to whom it belongs,"
said Commissioner McCray, a member
of the sub-committee. "The mlsstater
ment that General Funston ever swam
the river will be dropped now, while
there are men living in the State that
know it is not true." .
PORTL.AND, Or., May 21.â The Ore
gonian will to-morrow print the follow
ing account of the swimming of the
Bag Bag by General Funston at Ca
lumpit, Philippine Islands, April 26,
1899, the swimming 1 of the Rio
Grande the day following by two sol
diers of the Kansas regiment. It was
obtained from General Funston him
self and probably is the first correct
version ever published:
"A body of some 4000 Filipinos who
were on the far side of the Rio Grande
had been harassing the American
forces. On April 26, 1899, General Fun
ston, accompanied by a skirmish par
ty, swam the Bag Bag. a small, slug
gish stream about 100 feet wide, which
is tributary to the Rio Grande. This
act has been confused with and magni
fied into the swimming of the Rio
Grande the following day, April 26, by
two soldiers from the Kansas regiment,
which preceded the routing of the 4000
Filipinos by forty-five American â¢ sol
diers..
"These soldiers carried a line with
them with which they drew across a
heavier one. To the latter a raft was
fastened and drawn across. When the
forty-five soldiers and General Fun
ston had been ferried over the detach
ment routed the Filipinos."
General Funston concluded:
"It Is true I swam the Bag Bag, but
the event was of no importance. The
swimming of the Rio Grande by the
Kansas men was an entirely different
event. The Rio Grande Is a stream
fully half a mile wide with a current
running seven knots an hour, and to
have swam It would have been a physi
cal impossibility for me. The whole
trouble has been occasioned, I suppose,
by confupinsr the two streams and the
proximity of the events.
Â¦'I am glad to present the facts as
they are and clear the matter up." *

DENVER, May 21. â The executive
board of the Western Federation of
Miners decided to-day to recommend
that all unions in the jurisdiction of
the federation hold open sessions in or
der to. put the secret service agents of
the corporations out of business. It is
alleged by the board members that
these corporation agents join unions
and make fictitious reports to their
employers of what takes place at
union meetings.
John Mitchell, president of the
United Mine Workers of America, is
expected to be in Denver early next
week as one of a committee of three
which will go before the convention
of the Western Federation of Miners
and Invite that organization to be
come affiliated with the American
Federation of Labor.
W. D. Mahon of Detroit, president
of the International Association of
Street Car Men, which is also affiliat
ed with the American Federation of
Labor, is already in the city for the
purpose of serving on that committee.
It is probable that Max Morris, one of
the vice presidents of the American
Federation of Labor, will be the third
member .of the committee.
"No large metropolitan newspaper
can live without the support of
women," he continued. "Newspapers
to-day are edited for women and not
for men. If the women of the Gen
eral Federation of Women's Clubs will
set their face against scandal the ob
jectionable in Journalism will disap
pear. Women have a Joint respon
sibility with the editors as to the class
of news contained in the columns of
the metropolitan daily."
Previous to the press session a short
business session was held at the Odeon
in St. Louis.
Melville E. Stone spoke on the in
fluence of women on newspapers. He
said that not a line of scandal would
be printed in an American newspaper
were it not for the women.
ST. LOUIS, May 21.â Before the
press section of the biennial conven
tion of the General Federation of
Women's Clubs to-day, held in the
German Government pavilion at the
World's Fuir grourfds, "The Woman's
Column" was the subject of an ad
dress by Miss Livinia Egan of Louisi
ana, a member of the World's Fair
Board of Lady Managers. She said
that the "woman's column" in the av
erage newspaper is filled with "plau
dits and platitudes and piecrusts ar.d
padding."-.
"No woman." continued Miss Egan,
"is fit for the ballot or for equal rights
with men as long as she permits a
woman's column of accepted type.
"Clear it of recipes and frivolities
and let it express, the woman's point
of view." v - . 4
"The only reason for this litigation,"
Root said, "is this: Northern Pacific
stock has gone up from 115 to 135.
whereas Great Northern has dropped
from 180 to 170. The complainants
want to get back their Northern Pa
cific because they can make ten mil
lion dollars."
After reading: from the Supreme
Court opinion several paragraphs
bearing upon the dissolution of the
company. Root, said the plan of the
return of* the stock was tentative. ' It
had been suggested, but was not a
plan to the exclusion of any other
plan, but one which seemed entirely
equitable.
Judge Bradford asked: "If the se
curities company did not acquire
equitable ownership of the shares, how
could the company be justified In
treating as Its property that -which
was not its property? There seems to
be a paradox in the situation."
Root replied: "The opinion of the
Circuit Court, treats of the securities
company as the owner of the stock in
question. Also in Justice Harlan's
opinion it is set forth that the securi
ties company was the owner of the
stock, thus approving the opinion â¢ ot
the Circuit Court. It is also described,
in Justice Harlan's opinion as a hold
ing corporation and trustees and cus
todian having title to represent the
combination. There can be no <jues-
Root then resumed his argument,
begun yesterday. He maintained that
the decision of th'e courts did not ad
judicate the plaintiffs to be the legal
owners of the stock in question, and
that the United States Circuit Court,
sitting in St. Paul, had sustained his
view. The equity in the property held
by people who had bought in the open
market, he argued, must prevail
against the claim of counsel for Har
riman and Pierce and it would be en
tirely unjust to these people,
who would be deprived of their
rightful share in all the stocks. The
extra $10,000,000 which would accrue
to the Harriman interests, he insisted,
would be at the expense of the other
stockholders.

GRAPE-NUTS.
WHAT THE KING EATS.
What's Fit for IUm.
A Massachusetts lady who has been
through the rr.fll vith the trials of the
visual housekeeper and mother relates
an interesting: incident that occurred
not leng ago. She says:
"I can xvith all truthfulness say that
Grape-Nuts is the most beneficial of all
cereal foods in my family, young as
well as old. It is food and medicine
both to us. A few mornings ago at
breakfast my little boy said:
" 'Mamma, docs the JO"* eat Grape-
Nuts every morning?*
"I smiled and told him I did not
laiow. but that I thought Grape-Nuts
certainly made a delicious dish, fit for
a King." (It's a fact that the King of
Krgland and the German Emperor botn
eat Grape-Nuts).
"I find that by the constant use of
Grape-Nuts not only as a morning ce-
real, but also in puddings, salads, etc.,
made after the delicious recipes found
in the little book in each package it is
proving to be a great nerve food for
me, besides having completely cured a
lncg standing case of indigestion."
Xame given by Postum Co., Battle
Creek, Mich,
There is no doubt Grape-Nuts is the
most scientific food fn the world.
Ten days* trial of this proper food in
place of Improper food will show in
eU'&dy. stronger nerves, sharper brain
and the power to "go" longer and fur-
ther and accomplish more. There's a
reason.

little book. "The Road to WeUvlUe."

nic and hold its fourth annual reunion
at Mirabel Park, Sonoma County, June
14. That there will be a good time
those who have attended similar out
ings of the parish are well " aware.
This year there is a greater incentive
than ever to patronise the affair, as
the proceeds of the picnic are to be
used in the construction of the new
church at the corner of Eighteenth
and Howard streets. The question as
to what disposition should be made of
the money derived from the picnic
was settled at a meeting held on
Thursday in the schoolhouse.
A number of prizes will be awarded
to those who attend. This fact is ex
pected to increase the patronage- of
the" outing. Tickets can be procured
at the parochial residence, 390 Shot
well street, or from, any member of
the committee. * :
The following are members : of the

from Italian ships In
this harbor have lately been of fre
quent occurrence and a large number
of warrants for the arrest of the de
serters have been placed in the hands
of United States Marshal John H.
Shine. One of these sailors' named
Storace Arnedeo was arrested recently
in the house of a'man named G. Rossi,
who is reputed to be an anarchist.
Shortly after the assassination of
President McKinley Rossi and another
anarchist named Crispi were shad
owed for several weeks by United
States secret service detectives.
The arrest of Amedeo was at the
request of the Italian consulate in this
city. Judge de Haven made an order
yesterday that Amedeo should be con
fined in the County Jail to await tho
sailing of an Italian bark that is to
convey the^_prisoner to his ship, the
Llguria, which will be in the harbor
"of Honolulu. Rossi a,nd Crispi ap
peared to be very unwilling to let
Amedeo go back under Italian juris
diction and' they employed an attor
ney to try to effect the prisoner's re
lease on habeas corpus. Judge de
Haven, however, refused to issue the
writ and the prisoner will be returned
to his shin.

News f rpm "Washington that Major
Frank de L. Carrington was to be tried
by court martial for embezzlement
caused a tremendous sensation in army
circles hero yesterday. Coupled with
the fact that General Bates, in com
mand of the division of the northwest,
had reported to the authorities at
Washington that Carrington was miss
ing, the; information only added to the
amazement .of his brother officers.
/ It Is true that Carrington was found
in St. Louis shortly after General Bates
had Informed the War Department that
I he had disappeared from view. Where
he had been or what he had been doing
was not made public from the sec
ond report of General Bates, when he
stated that the missing 1 officer had
turned up.
Major Carrington has any number of
friends in San Francisco, both In army
and club circles, and they are all loth
to believe that he has committed any
wrong intentionally.
From the telegraphic report from
Washington it appears that Carring
ton is accused of having misappropri
ated funds that had been sent to him
to pay for the necessary expenses of
getting his provisional battalion of
Philippine scouts In a condition to go
to the St. Louis Exposition. No one
questions the fact that the scouts were
in fine condition when they arrived
here, and from their appearance It
could be inferred that the money had
been Judiciously expended.
It is reported that while the funds in
his possession were all properly spent,
he failed to render to the. Government
a statement with the necessary vouch
ers attached. It is also reported that
the War Department called upon him
several times to render supplementary
accounts, but for some reason he failed
to do this, so the Government decided
to bring him to time and accordingly
ordered him to report to Manila and
answer the charges in person.
His friends here, both in army and
civilian circles, all feel positive that -he
will be fully able to clear himself of
any accusations of dishonesty. He will
sail from this port for Manila on the
transport Sheridan, leaving here on
June 1.

A DECORATION DAY ART SUPPLEMENT.
Not all of the garlands of war are of laurel and palm; there are
others of withered and bitter leaves wliich do not crown the victors
or repose on the graves 'of those who have given their lives for their
oonntXT. They are worn by the women who have inherited the legacy *
of sorrow and loneliness through Hie death of a eon, a father or a
brother In war.
They cling in their bereavement to anything which may keep
fresh the memory of these dear ones. Their letters, portraits, any-
thing they have worn or owned are treasured as of priceless value and
on such a day as tlie one appointed to honor the nation's dead they
set-in to bring back something of the real presence of the heroes who
have fallen.
To express these thoughts on canvas is the motive of Edgar S.
Cameron's picture "Treasured Memories."
It depicts an aged mother honoring the memory of a son fallen ,
on a Southern battlefield by bringing out his rusty saber and thne-
worm uniform to place them in the chair, he used to sit in as a boy
while she rereads the letters whose contents she knows by heart.
It is thus on the anniversary of his death and Decoration day she
performs silently and alone what to her has become the celebration
of a sacred rite. The picture is one full of human interest and senti-
ment strongly expressed. It tells its story simply and directly and at the
same time it possesses artistic qualities of a high order. It is admirably
composed, effective, pleasing in color and carefully elaborated in its de-
tails.
Edgar S. Cameron, the artist who lias painted this picture, is ono
of the most prominent painters of figure compositions hi tho West.
Few men have the ability to paint well so many different classes of sub-
jects as he. Ten years ago he was painting military subjects, one of
which received honorable mention in the Yerkes prize competition.
Then followed decoration for the Worlds' Fair. The largest canvas he
has painted is a religious subject, "The Youth of Christ," now loaned . \ â¢
to the Union League Club of Chicago. % Two years ago he exhibited a
striking pictures of glass-blowers at work in the red light of the blow
furnace. This was purchased by the Chicago Woman's Aid Club. At
the Chicago Artists' Exhibition this year he showed an important
marine painting, "The Voiceful Sea," which was painted while the ar-
tist was returning from Paris last year, where he served as a member
of the international Jury of the exposition of 1900. This picture was
purchased by the Arche Club.
Besides painting these and countless genre and landscape subjects
3fr. Cameron has found time to contribnte occasionally articles on art
and art publications and to act as Instructor at the Art Academy. As
early as 1S88 be was an exhibitor in the Paris Salon.

She was removed to the City and
County Hospital last night. In addi
tion to the bruises which had been in
flicted, the woman was suffering from
alcoholism. Her case is not consid
ered serious.
Isabella King, who says she is a
concert hall singer, under the name of
Lillian Andrews, was found in an un
conscious condition at 3:30 yesterday
morning by Policeman Lycett at Four
teenth and Market streets. The
woman was bleeding from the ears
and her lace had been battered. She
was conveyed to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where she was held
pending an examination for fracture
of the skull. ,
The woman's story is to the effect
that she had been drinking during the
night with a piano player known as
"Spider," end that, some time after
midnight her husband, who had fol
lowed her, gave her the beating which
left her in the condition in which she
was found.

The sixteenth annual banquet of the
association will be given in the Occi
dental Hotel on the evening of Tuesday,
May 24. There will be a large attend
ance, as many non-residents of this

Colonel H. P. Bush, Colonel C. Mason
Kinne and Sergeant M. J. Myer.
All is not well in the councils of Com
pany L, Seventh Infantry, located at
Santa Ana. When Captain Greenleaf
of that company was promoted major a
vacancy in the company was filled by
the election of First Lieutenant Clyde
L. BishOD by a unanimous vote. The
captain-elect passed. It is said, a first
class examination at Los Angeles, but
he was turned down by the board of
examiners, composed of Lieutenant
Colonels Schreiber, Welch and Brad
bury. Whatever may have been the
reason for the act. Bishop is indignant,
says that he knows as mu'ch about mil
itary affairs as those who turned him
down and charges the board of exam
iners is trying to get even with him
on account of something that happened
in the past. The company will have to
hold another election, and the assur
ance is given that Bishop will again be
elected. In the meantime, by reason of
seniority of rank, he will continue to
command the company.
AT A BAXQUET.
An officer of the National Guard of
this State, in talking of the advantages
of instructing: men in the big gun ser
vice, said a few days since: "The War
Department, the State authorities and
the officers, stationed at the Presidio
have rendered and are willing to afford
every facility for the instruction of
the First Artillery Battalion. A draw
back in the matter of making the
guardsmen perfect soldiers at the bat
teries is in the inability of many of the
men to obtain from their employers
leave of absence to enable them to be
come proficient. As it is., they are re
quired to give their holiday season,
when they might rest or spend a short
time in the country, to practicing at
the Presidio. If the men of the bat
talion could attend a reasonable num
ber of drills yearly at the batteries, all
United States army officers who have
instructed the battalion In the past say
these men would soon vie with the reg
ulars in the handling of the guns.
At the annual meeting of the Veter
ans of the National Guard of Califor
nia the following were elected officers
of the organization: Colonel C. Mason
Klnne, commander; Sergeant M. J.
Myer, vice commander; C "W. Rader
bald, adjutant; Captain J. E. Klein,
paymaster.
The First Battalion of Artillery, Na
tional Guard "of California, will report
at the Presidio May 28 for three days*
drill and instruction in handling the
eight-inch breech-loading guns at Bat
tery Slaughter. Captain F. E. John
ston, artillery corps, U. S. A., will act
as instructor. Colonel C. Morris, com
manding officer at the Presidio, has is
sued the necessary instructions relative
to the camping and messing of the
men of the National Guard.
The officers and members of the Na
tional Guard Battalion of Artillery are
to be commended for seeking instruc
tions whenever their limited time per
mits in the artillery branch of the ser
vice so that they may be better fitted
for duty should they ever be called into
action. It is the only organization in
this State that has ever been drilled
at the high-power guns.
United States army officers say that
detachments of the State Guard located
at sea coast cities where there are de
fensive batteries should be properly in
structed in coast artillery service. Thus
the men in case of war would be avail
able to handle the big guns.

TREASURY WHITEWASHâ J. W.
D., City. The following is the recipe
for what ; ; known as United 1 States
Treasury Denrtment * whitewash.. It
has been found by experience to an
swer equally well on brick, wood or/
stone, and that it is almost as good as
paint and much cheaper: Slack a half
bushel of unshicked lime with boillncr
water, keeping it covered during- the
process: strain it a- , a'dd a peel; of
salt, dissolved in '.warm water; three
pounds of ground rice nut in boiling
water and boiled to a thin paste; half
a pound of powdered Sj nish whitlns
and a pound of clear glue dissolved in
warm water: mix these well together
and allow the mixture to stand for
several days. Keep the v . thus
prepared in a kettle or portable fur
nace and when used put it on as hot aa
possible with painter3* or whitewash
brushes.
The Russians are still distressing .heir thought cen

Russians wait until peace is declared and then some
Japanese admiral might be invited to make a Russian

Tile widening is urged strongly by large holders of
real estate. If there* is any opposition it has not publicly
developed. The effect on the Fourth street sidewalks will
be to reduce them from nineteen to fifteen feet in
width. A similar move was made in Third street, with
one block nearest to Market street being exceptcd. The
improved condition of Third street is used to- illustrate
the prospective appearance of Fourth street with wider
roadway and narrower sidewalks than it had formerly;
If the great increase in business and traffic in the
block bounded by. Third and Fourth arid Market and Mis
sion streets could have been foreseen when the city was
laid out there- would probably have been a street between
Third and Fourth . streets running south from s Market
street. The solid improvements that have been erected in
this business, section make it certain that no such street
can N be>ut;through between Third and Fourth streets for
A PETITION of owners of property is before the
Board of Supervisors for the widening of the
roadway of Fourth street. Tq secure greater road
space it is proposed to take four feet from the sidewalk
on each side of the street, making eight feet in all.. The
petition has been recommended. by the Board of Works
and will come before the. Street Committee of the
Board of Supervisors to-morrow for consideration. The
argument advanced in behalf of the widening of Fourth
street is that, it is a main thoroughfare that leads from
Market street to the Potrero and South San Francisco
and that it is rapidly becoming so congested during busi
ness hours that street travel. and the passage of teams
encounter serious interference. : ,

Sun dry the leaves of any of the fra

and a little alcohol, just enough to
moisten the leaves. The leaves should

not hot. After exposure a delightful
fragrance U emitted from the Jar. The
leaves so prepared may be placed in
a pillow or sachet bag. but the fra
grance when exposed to the air will

possible, with certain changes in the
fire boxes, to burn a fuel in the form
of petroleum briquettes, -which gives
off no smoke. The officer claims his in

pound is equivalent to four pounds of
coal. The briquettes are made by add
ing to petroleum oil, for each litre, ISO
grammes of ground soap. 150 grrammes
of resin and SOO grammes of caustic
soda lye. This mixture is first heated
and stirred until near solidification,
when it is poured into molds, which
in turn are then placed in an oven for
ten or fifteen minutes, and the bri
quettes are ready for use after cooling
a few hours. Greater solidity may be
obtained by the addition of a small
quantity of sawdust and a little clay
or sand.

IT is gratifying to observe that mining methods in
California are considered to be so superior that four
teen students from the University of Minnesota have
come to this State to study in the mines of Nevada Coun
ty. The young men are accompanied by Professor Van
Uarneveld and Instructor E. P. McCarthy, both of whom
will also pick up some practical information about mining
while they are in California.
The Minnesota School of Mines. sends a class annually
to study at some central point where mining is actually
in progress. Classes have in turn visited Butte and Ana
conda in Montana and mining centers in Utah, Colorado,
Michigan and Minnesota. The present class begins its
practical studies in California by an investigation of
quartz mining. Stamp milling, drift mining, cyaniding,
smelling, dredging for gold and other forms of'mineral
recovery are all in their reach in California. â¢
Incidentally, and this ought not to be lost sight of,
these incipient mining engineers will get some knowl
edge of the mineral resources of this State, which are
varied and vast, to take away and impart.
The great mother lode alone has wealth in it beyond
calculation. Modern methods make its low grade ores
profitable, while its high-class ores will reward the for-,
tunate with more immediate wealth. Ancient river
channels contain treasures like to those of ancient Ophir.
.Iudustrious'j.hpplication of skill will add their stores to
the world's- opulence. California needs money to de
velop its resources, and in no direction is this more true
than when applied to mines.
The coming of these mining students from far-away
Minnesota supplies a hint to this State that may be
valuably used. They will in time be advisers to capital
ists who are seeking to put their money in mining prop
erties. The mining engineers of the present time come
mainly from mining schools and universities where there
are maintained special mining departments. To en
courage the Minnesota students is desirable; so equally
it would be to induce students from mining schools in
all parls of the United States to visit California and in
spect its mines.
The advance party from Minnesota may well be fol
lowed by others from the Columbia School of Mines,
from the mining departments of Yale.tHarvard, the Uni
versity of Michigan and other great institutions. It
would pay California to bring such parties to California
mines.
The miners of Nevada County see clearly the ad
vantage of having mines in their county studied. The
Nevada County Miner describes the students from the
University of Minnesota as a fine looking lot of earnest,
intelligent young men, who seem to realize .thoroughly
the great responsibility resting upon the shoulders of a
mining engineer and to understand the dignity of their
profession. There is no doubt that this is an accurate
description.
California is turning out mining engineers from its
institutions of learning and many of them have already
become noted by their achievements in this and in other
countries. Their fame has brought students from abroad
to take mining courses in California. It is not possible
for all aspiring young mining engineers to come here
to reside, but if the way was made easy for them to make
a summer trip, unquestionably many would, journey
hither for a period of practical study in the mines. Con
sidering the great extent of mineralized lands in this
State there will not be too many mining engineers of the
right sort in the State in. many years to come. While
California furnishes a great opportunity for students to
learn by practical observation in existing mines, it also
affords a field for mining activity that is practically in
exhaustible.
A HINT FOR CALIFORNIA.
Seoul of the past is fast becoming
extinct. A modern red brick building,
headquarters of the American Electric
Company, rises in the center of the
town, and from its tower stately
churches and legation buildings can be
seen towering above the squat houses
of the natives. â Harper's Weekly.
Seoul is a walled city of nearly a
quarter of a million inhabitants, about
a third of whom live in extensive extra
mural suburbs. The wall is pierced by
eight gateways of massive stone, each
with a pagoda-shaped tower of one or
two stories above it. The nearest of
these to the railway station is. the
west gate. "The Gate of Bright
Amiability," and it is by this portal
that almost every visitor enters the
capital of the hermit kingdom. The
name of the city, by the way, is pro
nounced precisely as we would pro
nounce the female pig with an 1
added â that is, Sowl. I have never
heard a Korean pronuonce the name
in any other way.
The- word means "capital," nothing
more; but if there is small beauty or
originality about the name of the city,
there certainly is about its location,
for anything more strikingly pictur
esque than the site of the Korean
metropolis would indeed be difficult
to find. The cijy stands in a little
valley almost surrounded by rugged,
corrugated peaks. High along the top
of this mountain ridge runs the city
wall. Deep into the gullies it dips,
rising now and again to scale the
steepest slopes and crown the sum
mits of the loftiest pinnacles. In
olosed within this snakelike barrier
is such a - strange contrast between
wretched hovels and splendid palaces,
purposeless loafers and hurrying
crowds, broad streets and labyrinthine
alleys, spoMess cleanliness and un
speakable filth, as I doubt could be
equaled elsewhere on earth.
Along several of the main streets
are trolley lines, and every few min
utes a modern American electric car
whirls past us well patronized with
Koreans, both men and women.
Korea's Capital.
Another official of the United States Mint in this city
has listened to the tempter and now stands before his
fellows a confessed thief. Men pay too heavy a

utility, honesty in the American Federal service recom
mends itself to the observing for many distinct advan
tages.
Radium rays will not at present fur
nish a cure for blindness, reports Pro
fesor Greeff of Berlin in a published
account pf an official investigation of
the optical properties of radium. This
research was largely undertaken as thu
result of a paper by Professor London
of St. Petersburg, in which he claimed
that there was hope for the blind in
radium. According to Professor Green!
the rays given off by a fluorescent sur
face excited by radium rays are simply
those of ordinary light, and as such
cannot affect a blind eye. The actual
radium rays, however, are sent out in
all directions, penetrating all struc
tures, and the effect, a sort of sea
green radiance, is the same whether thÂ«
radium is held In front of the eye or
at the side of the head. It has been
asserted that fluorescence actually oc
curs in the eye and that rays of or
dinary light are accordingly emitted,
but this view is opposed by Professor
Greeff, and the fact is cited that the
radium rays do not bleach the visual
purple of the retina. He also states
that when the function of the rods and
cones which transmit visual concepts
from* the retina to the nerve centers is
destroyed the eye is unable to provide
for the sensation of sight. â Harper's
Weekly.

67,000. Thus far this year the number
of emigrants who have left these shores
for Canada is in excess of those for
a like period last year and during the
summer months it is expected that the
ratio' of Increase will be much greater.
Canadian officials in London are san
guine that when the year closes Canada
v ill be shown leading the United States
in the number of British emigrants re
ceived.
While Uncle Sam does nothing to at
tract emigrants' from this country, Can
ada is hustling to get them and meet
ing with such success that th-r colo
nies of the empire have been moved to
envy and are bestirring themselves to
follow her example and copy her meth
ods.
"England." said Mr. Preston to the
writer, "is the only European country
possessing colonies that devotes neith
er efforts nor money to encouraging
emigration to them. What England
won't do for us Canada is doing: for
herself, and when it is remembered
that four years ago we received only
about 11,000 emigrants from the United
Kingdom, we feel that she is not doing
it. badly, either.
"Jl costs something, of course, but it
is the best paying investment that Can
ada ever made. Last year we expended
'$300,000 in working up emigration from
thts tountry to Canada. We distributed
1,500.000 pamphlets, kept a lot of agents
on the jump and a pile of money
in advertising. But not a dollar went
in the shape of passage money. We are
not Priding any deadheads to Can
ada.
."A steamship agency, being interest
ed only in pocketing the emigrants*
fares, goes in for numbers, regardless
of quality, but as a department of the
Canadian Government we have to con
sider the fitness of the prospective emi
grants first. If v.v sent out a lot of
fhirkers and idlers we should soon lose
cur jobs. No man ever receives
atfiy encouragement from this office to
go to Canada who does not seem to
c liav<? the right stuff in him. As regards
quality the emigrants now going to
Ca'nada average far higher th&n those
T.ho seek their fortunes in the United
States. Over 52 per cent of the arri
vals in Canada laÂ«t year were agricul
turists, whereas of those who went to
America only 14 per cent belonged to
'that class. That tells the jstory. We get
very few emigrants from the undesir
able nationalities who are now swarm
ing to America in such large numbers."
Mr. Preston disregards all precedents
jv'hich are supposed to regulate the con
duct o'f an Englishman who attains to
the dignity of an important official po
sition. He allows himself Â«nly half an
hour instead of two hours' for lunch.
With nearly, a score of clerks under
hirm instead of contenting himself with
bossing tilings from the seclusion of
his private office, he talks freely with
prospective emigrants and helps win
now the grain fr^mi the chaff. Clear
skinned, sharp-eyed, breezy, energetic
and direct of speech, he Is a good type
of the Canadian hustler, the man who
ffeta there.
Situated at Charing Cross, in one of
the broadest thoroughfares of Dondon,
the Canadian Government emigration
offices are admirably located to attract
attention and the most is made of the
opportunities. No one can pass the
place without being made aware that
Canada is looking for emigrants and
is giving away 160-acre farms free. In
the windows are shown grains, fruits
and cereals and other typical Canadian
product?, alluring photographs and
lithographs, while a gigantic moose

Idea conveyed being that Canada is a
country where men can not only make
a good living, but have a good time
as' well. As one notes the throngr of
people gazing at this show, what ex
cites wonder is not the size of the pres
ent stream of emigration to Canada,
but that many more thou?ands do not
jump at the chance to leave this man- t
stifled town, with its vast deserts of
brick and mortar, where many of them
eke out a bare, barren existence, for
a land where they can at least find
breathing space and elbow room. Those
who manifest a desire to do this are
.handed a pamphlet which ort.tfte first
papre contains this statement of the
kind of emigrants Canada wants: j
"Firstlyâ Farmers or persons with ex- !
perience on farms.
"Secondlyâ Men who have been ac
customed to hard work and who have
pluck and ambition to succeed.
"Thirdlyâ Persons without experience
in * agricultural pursuits, but who are
determined to devote themselves to that
occupation, and are willing to accept
employment for the purpose of acquir
ing the necessary knowledge regarding
methods of work in Canada."

A certain well known school teacher
who resides in this city, but who ia
teaching in San Jose, is telling a good
story on herself. It appears that she
comes v up from the Garden City every
Friday night and remains over until
Monday morning. Because of the
shortness of the interval between the
hour when her school closes and the
time the train leaves for this city, she
is compelled to don her best raiment
Friday morning and prepare for her
trip before going to school. One of her
bright pupils, a little boy, noticed that
on Friday the teacher was always
dressed a la mode, and It apparently
bothered him a, great deal, particularly
as on all other days she appeared be
fore her class clad in neat but plain
attire.
One Friday at noon this observing
little fellow walked up to the desk
of his teacher while she was eating her
lunch and attracted her attention by
calling "teacher."
"What is it, Willie?" said the
teacher.
"Why don't you always dress like a
lady?"
Clothes Make the Lady.
In Germany in 187C a statute was
passed requiring that every child must
be vaccinated before â¢ completing the
first year of its age and again when 12
years old. This statute has been 'rigid
ly enforced and as a result Germany
has been kept well-nigh free from the
smallpox. In a population of over 50,
000.000 the average during the last
twelve years has been only fifty cases.
The system of Immediately quarantin
ing a smallpox patient, as is done in
Baltimore, prevails in Germany, and
complete isolation is attained. Rigid
rules in regard to the disinfection of
clothing are observed, and while every
effort is made to save the patient's life,
the safety of others is also considered.
Germany not only believes in thorough
vaccination, but can now present facts
to prove its inestimable value. Great
Britain, on the other hand, has heark
ened to the protests of the anti-vaccin
ationists and has paid dearly for its
folly. On account of the opposition to
the compulsory law Parliament about
six years ago made the statute less
rigid, and as a result smallpox has be
come far more prevalent than formerly.
Instead of an average of fifty cases in
a population of 50,000,000, as in Ger
many, Great Britain shows an annual
mortality of 900 in a population of 32,
500.000. These figures are matters of
record and there can be no contradic
tion of them.

In his recent work, "Careers of Dan
ger and Daringr." which the " Century
Company publishes, Cleveland Moffett
tells of the fear that is ever at the el
bows of the professional diver. He
says:
"It is amusing to note the scorn of
practical divers for the nice electric
lighting and telephone contrivances of
divers who never dive, but sell their
inventions to the Government for its
Newport diving school, which tame in
ventions remain, for the most part, in
their spick-span boxes. It seems sim
ple enough to have submarine lights;
yet divers who dive prefer to grope in
the almost darkness of our ordinary
waters. It seems a distinct advantage
that diver and tender be -able to talk
over a wire; yet divers who dive keep
Jealously to the clumsy system of jerks
on the lines, and will not even be both
ered with the Morse alphabet. The fact
is, a diver has quite as much as he
can attend to with the burden of his
suit (about 175 pounds), and -his two
lines to watch and keep from kinks
and entanglements. Touch one of these
lines and you touch his life. Fasten a
new line to him, or two new lines, and
you enormously increase his peril.
Imagine yourself stumbling about in a
dark forest, with a man strapped on
your back, and several ropes dragging
behind you among trees and rocks, each
separate rope being to you as breath
and blood! That is precisely the diver's
case. So he goes; so he works. And
when they offer him a pretty apparatus
to increase his load, he will have none
of it. Nor will he tug any extra ropes.
" 'I have ways enough of dying as it
is.' says he.
"Working thus in gloom or --ukness,
the diver develops his senses of feeling
and locality. He gains certain qualities
of blind men, and finds guidance in un
lookt 1-for ways. The ascending bub
bles from his helmet, for instance,
shire silver white and may be seen for
a couple of fathoms. These bubbles
have a trick of lodging in a. vessel's
seams, and so give the diver a rough
pattern df her Again, in searching for
leaks, the sense of hearing helps him,
for he can distinguish (after long habit)
the sucking sound of water rushing
through the holes.
"One is sorry to learn that divers go
to pieces early; few of them last be- !
yond fifty. As they grow old their
keenness wanes; they lose their bear-!
ings easily down below, and show bad j
judgment. And fear of the business
grows upon them. Often they seek false
courage in strong drink, which hurries
on the end. Too many of them, after
searching all their lives for wrecks,
wind up as wrecks themselves. But it |
is good to know that there are excep- j
tions â divers like Bill Atkinson, sturdy j
and true at 50. and good in the suit for
years to come, unless their wives per- i
suade them to retire. The diver's wife, !
I am told â poor woman! â starts with |
terror every time she hears a door
bell ring."

tending across the whole front page of
a newspaper. In the pamphlets Issued
to attract British emigrants shrewd
use is made of the statistics relating
to the large migration of American
farmers to Canada. Americans are
given credit for knowing a good thing
when they see it and being a little bit
quicker to possess it than any other
people. And the British agriculturists
are urged to profit by their example
and share In their prosperity. Promin
ence is given to American opinions on .
the fertility and future destiny of
Northwest Canada. Among others
James J. Hill is quoted as predicting
that "in ten years It will raise all the
wheat ;that Great Britain needs." Thus
Canada makes America lend a hand In
drumming up emigrants.
MR. HEARST has written another editorial. Its
subject is Mr. Rockefeller, but it is made the
means of renewing Mr. Hearst's allegiance to
Christianity and of accounting for certain features in
his career. This is gratifying to the orthodox world, as
Mr. Hearst's defection to the doctrine of transmigra
tion of the soul was becoming serious. Perhaps we owe
his recantation to the influence of Bishop Potter, who
is said in his campaign biography to have watched and
tended him from his innocent and interesting child
hood. If this be so, the Bishop is to be congratulated
upon snatching another brand from the burning.
Jn the editorial Mr. Hearst assesses Mr. Rockefeller's
wealth at a billion dollars, but insists that: "About the
much discussed John D. Rockefeller there is a pleasant
side, a cheerful side." Evidently it is not Mr. Rocke
feller's inside, for he is a chronic dyspeptic, 'given over
' to the remorse of a guilty stomach, and suffering in
ternal pangs which forbid indulgence in the pleasure
of the table, and confine him to oatmeal mush and
those other melancholy emulsions devised by the break
fast food people of Battle Creek, Michigan.
Mr. Hearst explains that this billionaire is "a quiet,
peaceful man, astonishingly free from vicious habits, or
any inclination to interfere with the ordinary routine
of life." We are glad to know this. He might take a
notion to make us go to bed in the morning and eat
breakfast in the evening. Mr. Hearst's guarantee that
he will not do so is reassuring. But our real interest in
this is Mr. Hearst's statement that "John D. Rockefeller
is religious, sincerely religious. The people at large
owe much to the Christian religion because of the effect
it has on Rockefeller." Thanks for pointing it out to
us. Resolutions of thanks to Christianity should be
passed .at once and forwarded to Mr. Hearst.
After the editorial, on transmigration there was a fear
that Mr. Rockefeller would become reckless and
wicked, not wicked enough to reappear as a woman;
but in view of his indigestion and lack of hair he might
have concluded to be bad enough to return to us as an
animal, perhaps a lion, for a lion gnaws his bone and
swallows the pieces and sleeps like a top, and then he
is not a bald animal, but is hairy. If Mr. Rockefeller
had followed Mr. Hearst into transmigration of the soul
he might have stayed. there, but he abided with the plan
of salvation and the Baptist church, and Mr. Hearst
says that: "Thanks to his religious belief he sets an ex
cellent example to every man of great wealth. He refrains
in his personal life from setting an evil example to his fel
low-citizens."
Now we are getting at it. Mr. Hearst is also a very
rich man and he accounts for himself and Mr. Rocke
feller being found birds of a feather, brooded under the
wing of the church. It is their fellowship insetting a
good example in their personal lives. Mr. Hearst go3S
on to say that he knows of a man -worth twenty millions,
who died the other day, who spent his money in the
most vicious possible way, "encouraging vice in his so
cial circle, gambling in all its forms, drinking and excesses
in every direction." It is intimated that that reprehen
sible person is now asking Dives the way t# the old
oaken buefcet, while Mr. Rockefeller, with his "fifty times
twenty millions and his Sunday-school tendencies, "is
making little sermons at Sunday school and Y. M. C. A.
meetings." Â«,
But there is a rift in every lute; a blemish on every
lily; imperfection in the rose itself and perfection is not
anywhere. Mr. Hearst says he is compelled to admit
that, "while Mr. Rockefeller does not irritate the poor^
he ignores the biblical coinmmand to give all to the
poor and follow Christ." There Hearst and Rockefeller
part company, Rockefeller, like the rich young man,
goes away sorrowing, and Mr. Hearst is accounted for.
Even as a candidate for the Presidency he has been
obeying that command which falls upon the Rockefel
ler car unheeded. For months past he has been giving
to the people all over the United States. When they met
at Santa Cruz the other day his hand was there, ajid so
was theirs. In, Indiana he was like the help that cometh
from the hills, and put the poor in shape to get through
the summer by offering them a half million.
.Mr. Rockefeller may choose to fool with fire and let
his immortal soul slip up and fall on the broiler by refus
ing to give up to the indigent; but as for Mr. Hearat, he
proposes to seek cold storage, if liberal use of lucre with
the poor will do it. After parting company with Rocke
feller in this respect, Mr. Hearst proceeds to see in him
a dangef to the republic. He is all right in social mo
rality but a danger to our political morality."
From this we infer that a man may be a destroyer of
social morality, but as a supporter of political morality
deserves reward. Whose case is MY. Hearst pleading?
BACK TO CHRISTIANITY.
many years, if ever. The only way in sight, therefore, to
augment traffic between Market street and the growing
section south of the city's principal thoroughfare is by
making wider roads. "
The widening of Mission street has been recom
mended and will be a part of the municipal budget.
Third street has been widened by the city, the expense
being provided for in the budget of 1903-4. The expense
of giving. Fourth street better facilities for travel will
fall apon the city if the Supervisors act favorably in the
premises. There has been a vast increase in business in
the three mentioned streets in the past few years; with
the growth of the city the volume of traffic wil\ be con
tinually increased. The present size is such that there
is an urgent call for more room immediately.
The cost of widening Fourth street is estimated at
$85,000. Market street, it is urged, will be relieved by
providing wider outlets for the stream of traffic to run
in. The argument would seem to be good. Whatever
makes for the promotion of business is good for the
entire city, a fact that is of general acceptation. In
time other streets leading from Market street south
ward may also be broadened. Many citizens believe that
developments in the "immediate ' future will make that
necessary. .

The Charles Nelson Lumber Com
pany of San Francisco has secured a

of the Puget Sound Lumber Company.
The deal involves the transfer of about
5.000,000 feet of lumber and Interests
valued at $150,000. The sale is consid
ered an important one, as the Puget
Sound Lumber Company is one of the
largest concerns on the coast, while
by the additions of the yards in Oak
land and Alameda the Charles Nelson
Company has increased its already
large holdings.
The purchase only includes the yards
and the stock of lumber they contain.
The Nelson company has Its own ves

expects to become the largest concern
of its kind on the Pacific Coast. The

Young Clayburgh will evidently
avoid his parental xoof for some time.
He will not -be received with open
arms and if the denunciation of rela

time breaking back into ' their
good graces. There were none
of the appearances of the wed
ding feast at the Clayburgh
home on Jackson street in San Fran
cisco yesterday. Instead a solemnity
had spread over it and the relatives
and their sympathetic friends spoke of
the young man as if the light of for
giveness could never be cast upon
him. "We don't know him, and we
don't want to know him," was the
reply given to a question concerning
the elopement. "We don't know the
girl he married, and don't want to
know her, either."
. Clayburgh is a graduate of the Uni
versity of California and his wife won
honors at Stanford. Both are well
known in social and university circles
and are very popular in their set.
XOT WELCOME HOME.
Shortly after the noon hour to-day
Simon Clayburgh telephoned from San
Francisco to the office of the County
Clerk and inquired if a marriage li
cense had been issued for his son and
Miss Wineburgh. He was told that
no application had been made for such
a paper and he replied that his son
would arrive there soon and asked the
Clerk to deny him a license. When
he was informed that the couple had a
right to marry if they were both of
legal age, he begged in an excited man
ner that the issuance of the license
might be delayed until he could arrive
on the next boat.
Fifteen minutes later young Clay
burgh and his bride-to-be appeared.
They were told of Clayburgh's mes
sage, but insisted on receiving the li
cense and their request was complied
with. In the meantime Justice of the
Peace Geary had been telephoned for
and the couple retired to the Super
visors* chambers to await his arrival.
Then came Loewe and Lilienfeld, who,
when they were told that the license
had been granted, started on a chase
to head the Justice off.
While the uncles of the bride were
on their hunt Justice Geary was
speaking the words that made the two
young people one in the eyes of the
law, and when the ceremony had been
concluded Clayburgh and his bride
left the hall and returned to San Fran
cisco.
RELATIVES MAKE PROTEST.
Clayburgh is 22 years of age and
the young lady who is now his wife
is 21. They met about three years
ago and soon formed an attachment.
The love affair advanced placidly until
their parent% became cognizant of the
fact that they desired to marry and
then all was not well. . Clayburgh's
people believed him of too tender
years to assume the responsibilities of
married life and Miss Wlneburgh's
parents also discouraged, the suit on
that score.
Ignoring parental objection and out
witting relatives who sought to re
strain them, young Leon S. Clayburgh
and Miss Eva E. Wiueburgh, both of
San Francisco, eloped to this city to
day and were quietly married by a
Justice of the Peace; While the cere
mony was being performed in the Su
pervisors' chambers in the City* Hall,
two uncles of the ' bride, who came
from San Francisco for the purpose of
delaying the marriage, were on a wild
goose chase about the city and the
youthful swain and his lady love found
no obstacle in the way of their plans.
The groom is the son of Simon Clay
burgh, with the firm of Poly, Hilborn
& Co., butchers, and has resided at
1916 Jackson street, San Francisco.
The bride is the daughter of E. Wine
burgh, a San Diego merchant, and
lives at 945 Post street. She is the
niece of Joseph Loewe and Alfred
Lilienfeld.

and your family ought to be wiped off
the face of the earth," alleges Mrs.
Swirling, is a pet expression of her
husband.
FEAJtS HUSBAND.
From time Immemorial it has been
popularly supposed that a woman who
could refrain from talking for five
minutes at a time was a creature of
great rarity. It remains for a San
Francisco man to shatter this belief,
for- if the divorce complaint of Henry
W. von Kapff contains allegations thai
are true, thereis a woman in this city
who can refrain from talking for five
days at a time.
The woman is his wife, Isabella G.
von Kapff, and her silence is the cause
of the plaintiff's unhappiness. In his
complaint, which was filed yesterday,
Kapff asks for a divorce on the ground
of cruelty, alleging that his wife
"maintains a silence for five days at
a time" and refuses to pay any at
tention to him. His mental sufferings
are intense,' he says, and he asks the
court to sever the bonds that bind him
to the alleged cause of his misery.
As another reason for divorce Von
Kapff charges that his spouse has de
serted him. He says that in February
of this year she packed up the furni
ture of the rooms he had fitted up for
her, even to the pillows and bed
clothes, and "silently stole, away." The
marriage of the Von Kapffs occurred
less than a year ago.

I Miss Nellie Holmes, treasurer of theg|
Young Woman's Temperance Association
of Buffalo, N. Y., strongly advises all suf-
fering women to rely, as she did, upon
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham : â Your medicine is indeed an ideal woman's
medicine, and by far the best I know to restore lost health and strength. I
suffered misery for several years, being troubled with xnenorrhagia. My back
ached, I had bearing-down pains and frequent headaches. I would often
wake from restful sleep, and* in such pain that I suffered for hours before I
could go to sleep again. I dreaded the lonj? nights as much as the weary days.
I consulted two different physicians, hoping to get relief, bu.^finding' that
their medicine did not seem to cure me, I tried your Vegetable Compound,
on the recommendation of a friend from the East who was visiting me.
" I am glad that I followed her advice, for every ache and pain is gone,
and not only this, but ay general health is much improved. I have a fine
appetite and have gained in flesh. My earnest advice to suffering women is
to put away all other medicines and to take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound."â Miss Nellie Holmes, 540 No. Division St., Buffalo, N.Y.
fibs Irene Crosby, prominent in Social Life in East
Savanah, Ga., adds her testimonial to the value
of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.

"WASHINGTON. May 21. â Acting
Secretary of State Loomis made the
following statement to-day: '
"In order to completely close the
Panama canal transaction and to
avoid any question as to the authority
of the United States over the canal
zone arising out of the fact that the
consideration for the concession had
not actually been paid as provided by
the treaty, the Department of State,
acting under the advice of the Attor
ney General, has paid over to J. P.
Morgan & Co., the duly constituted
fiscal agents of the Panama Govern
ment, the remaining $ 9,000,000 of the
sum stipulated in the treaty as the
consideration for the concession."
The warrant was made out yester
day by the treasury officials and was
brought to Loomis, who to-day handed
it to George W. Perkins, representing
Morgan & Co., who In turn will cash
it at the New York Sub-Treasury. It
was the original plan of the depart
ment to retain this $9,000,000 in the
treasury until the arrival here next
June of Senor Obaldia, the newly ap
pointed Panama Minister. This plan
was suggested by the Government of
Panama, which was not disposed to
have bo large a sum of money as
$10,000,000 at one time placed in the
Pamanan treasury, where it might
prove a great temptation to revolu
tionary efforts.
CALL, BUREAU, HOTEL. BARTON,
WASHINGTON. May 21.â The Russian
embassy reported to police headquar
ters to-day that a thief had gained ac
cess to the apartments of Countess
Casslni and rifled her Jewel case, ob
taining among other valuable articles,
a magnificent diamond and pearl
brooch valued at $1000. It was stated
that although the loss has just been
discovered, the Countess believes the
robbery occurred during the progress
of her Russian Red Cross bazaar held
in this city on April 28.
The loss of the Jewels is the last of
a series of misfortunes sustained by
the young Countess in her work of
charity. During the progress of the
bazaar a valuable gold watch, which
was being raffled, was stolen and the
Countess replaced the article at her
own expense, to protect the interests of
those who had taken chances.
Captain Boardman of the detective
force has detailed two of his best men
on the case, but the lapse of time since
â¢the robbery occurred increases the dif
ficulties of locating the thief and re
covering the jewels. ,
At the embassy there seems to be
the^ greatest mystery about the affair
and all. are at a loss to account for the
manner of the robbery. They are re
luctant to attribute it to any one of
the many society people. who attended
the bazaar.

ROME, May 2Lâ M. Nisard, French
Embassa<5or to the Vatican, acting un
tfer instructions from Paris, left Rome
to -night for an unlimited vacation as a
protest against what France regards as
the indelicate attitude of the Vatican
in compiling two different notes con
cerning the visit of President Loubet
lo Rome.
" Tlje Pcz>e is greatly worried over the
conflict betw<?Â«n the Vatican and
France. His Holiness suspended public
conferences to-day and conferred at
length W jth the papal Secretary of
Â£tate. Cardinal Merry del VaL who
stated to him what he had said to M.
Nisard. He said that France had mis
understood his intention, and that he
had omitted the phrase regarding the
recall of the nuncio from the note to
Franoe out of regard to that republic
while he inserted it in the note to the
other governments.
M. Nisard expressed to the Cardinal
his regret that he was unable to dis
<. uts the matter, the instructions from
his" Government being to leave Rome
v.hcn he Had ascertained officially the
differences between the note to France
"and those to the other powers.
Active inquiries are being made to
find out how L'Humanlte received the
note. It le generally believed that Ger
man Socialists succeeded in securing
the text of the note from the Prussian
Government and communicated it to
their friends in the French Socialistic
c ranks.
.Among the Cardinals there is consid
erable feeling against the papal secre
tary, and condemnation is expressed
of the way in which he has brought
abput an almost official rupture with
Fiance.
PARIS, May 21.â The formal an
nouncement of the recall of M. Nisard,
ihe .French Embassador to the Holy
S<-+. was made this evening, and the
following official statement was com
municated to the press:
'Embassador Nisard Is recalled, and
the secretary of the Embassador will
iakr ; charge of affairs during his &b
f^nce. The Embassador will leave Rome
this evening."
Definite official action was not taken
until late in the day. Prior to this M.
Nieard had been directed to endeavor
to secure from the Vatican authentic
information relative to the protest for-,
warded to the powers. It is understood
that the interviews between the Em
hassadors and the papal authorities
were not satisfactory, not giving com
plete information In the matter and
therefore the recall was decided upon.
It is learned In official quarters that
the Government's plans, as carefully
outlined, do not anticipate the denun
riation of the concordat, or any pres
ent etep beyond the recall of M. Nisard.
Tfce Government's programme, it Is
paid, which is from an authoritative
quarter, Is as follows:
â¢*M. Nteard'8 leave will be Indefinite,
but no further steps are contemplated
at present unless Parliament directs
that further action be taken. Efforts
are being made to induce the Premier
to follow up the Embassador's recall
by a' denunciation of the concordat, but
M. Cpmbes does not wish to go to that
extreme"
The result of the rupture with the Vat
ican promises to materially strengthen
Z\l. Combes' administration.
Smith says that he read in the papers
the other day about Carnegie's way of

Smith confirmed the report that he

week. He says that "to please the old
lady" he transferred- the property to
his brother-in-law, John Thornton. It
cost him $60,000 and the man who once
ran a baker wagon on commission
speaks of this sum as a "mere trifle."

NEW YORK, May 21.â A leading

race tracks. All the courses in ex
istence in or near New York will be
subjected to the most vigorous cam
paign in the history of racing. The
war. it is sajd, will be a measure grow
ing out of the suppression of the pool
rooms. It Is even intimated that plans
are being formulated for legislation
which would make racing in this State
impossible.
Already a- public attack upon the
race tracks has been begun, demands
are being made for the abolition of
betting and negotiations are said to be
under way for the publication of arti

cases to the highest courts.
One of the oldest poolroom keepers

the new movement.
CALIFORNIA TARS TO RACE
FOR HANDICAP TROPHY
A little error by Buck Francks, then
a base on balls in the third round of
the battle at Recreation Park yester
day afternoon gave a start to the worst
ball game of the season. It was so bad
that It finally became funny and the
fans were laying odds that the score
would finally be 100 to 1 in favor of
L03 Angeles, but it only reached ten.
At that Oakland led in getting the
first run in. With the bases all filled
in the second and with two out, Baum
walked Ganley and forced in the only
run Oakland made. In the third Baum
was given a life on Francks' fumble.
Toman walked, after which Wheeler,
Flood and Cravath all hit safely, which
gave the Angels four runs.
Dr. Moskiman quit right there. He
never tried to pitch any more ball and
the result was that the Angels got all
kinds of runs on all kinds of plays.
No one on the Oakland team could
field the ball to the bases and when
ever it did get there, the baseman was
wont to drop it. The fans howled their
displeasure and most of them stalked
out of the park before the game was
half finished.
When the seventh (rolled around,
Moskiman quit the box for keeps and
"Bush" Streib took up the burden. He
Just put 'em over the plate and made
the batters hit the ball. Consequently
the Angels got no more runs. The
crowd cheered for the youngster as he
retired the side in the last three inn
ings without a run. The score:

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
The Academic Athletic League tour
naments came to a close yesterday on
the California Club courts, when the
doubles were finished. In this case, as
In the singles, the honors went to
Berkeley. Herbert Schmidt of Boone's
University school is singles champion
for the year, and R. Clinch and Powell
of Berkeley High School are champions
in doubles.
As was expected, the contestants In
the finals were the "Long brothers of
Lowell High School and Clinch and
Powell. An unusually close and hard
fought five-set match resulted, in which
the Berkeley boys won the first, second
and fifth sets. The first two sets were
the closest. fiThe Long brothers had a
good lead In each, but Herbert Long
played a miserable game and his
younger brother received poor, support
from him.
In the second and third sets the
Longs seemed to forget they were in a
tournament and their play Improved
wonderfully. Herbert Long played with
a dash and his team won the third and
fourth sets easily. With a lead of 3-0
and 40-30 in the final set. the Lowell
representatives hardly looked to have a
chance to lose, but their opponents, by
careful, steady play, took the set, 6 â 4.
Poor management undoubtedly losst
the championship for the Long broth
ers. An Improper drawing forced them
to play more matches than their op
ponents, who received a bye in the
semi-final round. The same thing hap
pened In' the singles tournament,' in
which Schmidt escaped by a narrow
margin. Had the Long brothers been
as fresh as their opponents they would
probably have won. On form they
looked to be easily the best team in the
tournament, but Herbert Long, as
usual, went to pieces and played away
below form. His younger brother, Mel
ville, played an excellent game
throughout. Clinch was the mainstay
of his team and did some clever net
work. Powell did well for a beginner,
his lobbing being very good.
Tea teams entered the competition,
but half of them defaulted. The five
teams that played Were evenly matched
and only one won In straight sets.
In the preliminary round Gabriel and
La Garde of Wilmerding School made a
good showing against the Long broth
ers. Gabriel played a splendid game,
both at the net and in the back court.
Hotchklss and Naylor of Lick also
won a set from the Longs. Hotchkiss
played an aggressive game, but his
partner was rather weak.
In the other half Clinch and Powell
had rather an easy time. After losing
the first set to Gott and Medcraft of
the Alameda High School they won out
the next two easily.
The tournament by rounds follows:
Preliminary Gott and Med
craft (Alameda High) beat Tallant and
Barrett (Hitchcock) by default; Clinch
and Powell (Berkeley High) beat Por
ter and Everhart (Woodland) by de
fault; Roberts and Hayden (Oakland
High) beat Cuhna and Schmidt
(Boone's) by default: Long brothers
(Lowell High) beat Gabriel and La
Garde (Wilmerding), *â 4, 4â 6, 6â4.
First round â Clinch and Powell beat
Gott and Medcraft, 4â6, 6â1, 6â2;
Hotchkiss and Naylor beat Roberts and
Hayden. 6â4, 6â4. .
Semi-finals â Clinch and Powell, a
bye; Long brothers beat Hotchkiss and
Naylor, 6â2, 6â8, 6â3.

NEW YORK, Mav 21.â It would be
difficult to name the most important
event of the afternoon at Morris Park
track, bo prolific was it of races of
more than usual Interest to-day. Aside
from the Stallion stake, the Ladles'
stake and the Grand National steeple
chase, the skyrocket performance of E.
R. Thomas' Brooklyn handicap candi
date, Hermis, in making a fair field of
handicap horses look cheap in the mile
race at the end of the day was the
most attractive.'
No easier, victory was ever seen than
that of Hermis, which was accorded an
earnest ovation by about 40,000 people.
It was almost as If the Brooklyn handi
cap were being run and won, Â«o pro
longed was the applause for this ever
popular horse. That Hermis Is the fast
est horse at a mile now In training was
claimed Instantly after the timeâ
1:39 8-5â was hungr out. It Is true Irish
Lad won the Metropolitan In 1:40 with
123 pounds up, compared with Hermis'
mile in 1:39 8-5 with 128 pounds. The
only line Is furnished by Toboggan,
which, in the Metropolitan had 103
pounds up and in to-day's race 113
pounds.
If only because the National Stallion
stake was won by Tanya, a filly bred
by the late William C. Whitney, there
was much sentimental Interest In the
stake. As a spectacle it surpassed /any
other race of recent years for this par
ticular event. The stake was worth
$11,915 to the winner.
August Belmont had the pleasure of
seeing his fllly Beldame, whose run
ning qualities are leased to Newton
BennJngton, win the Ladles' stake after
twice running away. Summary:

CHICAGO, .May 21.â English Lad,
the heavily backed favorite, won the
Chicago Derby at, Hawthorne to-day
by half a" length in a fierce drive with
Prince Silverwlngs. Moharlb, winner of
the Kansas City Derby, was third. The
time was 2:06.
English Lad's victory wasa popular
one, '''and'- when he passed under the
wire winner of the $15,000 race a tumult
among the 15,000 persons that packed
the grand stand and crowded the in
field was caused.
After a prompt start Prince Silver
wings took the lead and remained In
front until the stretch was reached. As
the horses turned into the stretch there
was a roar among the spectators as
English Lad, responding to the light
' touch of Nichols* whip, sprang forward
and passed Prince Silverwlngs. From
that point on English Lad held his
place and passed under the wire a wln
; ner by half a length. Prince Silver
! wings was the same distance in front
of Moharib.
For the first time in the history of
Chicago racing the Western Union Tel
egraph Company was barred from the
track. The order was made, It is be
lieved, because of the recent action of
the telegraph company in refusing to
continue Its racing services to pool
rooms. Newspapers and all other cus
tomers of the telegraph company suf
fered from the order. The threatened
raid on bookmakers and track officers
by constables amounted to .nothing.
While there were a score of constables
carrying warrants to be served, only
.two arrests were. made, and this was
done so quietly that few patrons of
the. track had any knowledge of the
proceedings. The arrests had no effect
on the betting, as the men were,, al
lowed to continue taking bets, after
having been served with the warrants.

A disease so painful and far-reaching in its effects ' lllillLj V

Russia's Commissariat Problem.
France Milnitaire contains an inter
esting study of the commissariat prob
lem of the Russian army. For an army
of 300,000 men and 100,000 horses 1600
tons of food and fodder are required.
This amount can be transported in six
trains composed of from thirty to thir
ty-five cars, the loading of which re
quires not more than a day. But there
are already at Mukden, Port Arthur
and other points in Manchuria provi
sions for six months, and Manchuria
and the Russian coast provinces are
rich in grain and cattle. According to
this study, in September Russia can
dispose of 60,000 tons of grain produced

During her last trio from Portland
Â¦the schooner Alliance, which arrive!
here Friday, ran Into and probably
killed a huge whale. The steamer
was running at full speed. The whale
.efcme to the surface about ten feet
ahead of the schooner and was struck
.with terrific force. The Alliance shiv
ered her timbers with a vengeance and
â¢ for a few minutes Captain Hardwick
thought he had found the uncharted
rock so familiar to Government In
spectors Bolles and Buljjer. The im
pact stopped the steamer's headway,
bufthe collision did not seem to budge
the whale, which drifted off appar
ently unconscious of the jar. Pres
ently, however, the water in the vicin
ity of the whale turned red with
blood and after a few convulsive wags
of his tail the monster lay still and
made no further move while in sight
of. the people on the steamer.
â¢ The Alliance struck the whale hend
â¢ on and sustained no damage, but Cap
lain Hardwick thinks the whale re
ceived a mortal blow.

PET ALUM A, May 21. â Fifteen hun
dred people attended to-day's races at
Kenilworth Park, half of them coming
from San Francisco. The big event of
the day was the victory of Capp &
Co.'s bay gelding Montezuma, played
at 100 - to 1. Several country people
who nibbled at the big odds are rejoic
ing. The horse was 30 to 1 place and
10 to 1 show. Montezuma was third at
the start. At the half he was second to
Juan Bellardo and won handily by a
length and a half. Abydos came from
fourth place in the stretch and took
second money.
In the maiden race Only Jimmy won
sheckels for his admirers at 12 to 1. He
won easily. Stover's Illowaho took the
honors in the fourth race. . P. Sher
idan's Mlrrio won a close race from
Pat Morrissey and Chileno. Stanfield's
David S. won easily his event, leading
Dr. Birdsall two and a half lengths.
Betting was brisk, the weather was
fine and' the track' fast. It is stated
the meet will be extended ten days, but
this could not be verified. Most of the
horses will leave about June 1 for the
Seattle meeting. Summary:

The reins of government are drawn
.tight in Tahiti these days and the
easy goingr natives are learning some
" thing of the drought which is legally
supposed to exist in an American pro
hibition district. Acting Governor
Corr. who represents France in the
JFYench South Sea possessions, of
which Tahiti forms an important part,
has issued an edict forbidding the
manufacture and sale of rum in any
l/aj"t" of the domain under his rule,
' except in the city of Papeete and in
several other principal ports of some
of the other islanas.
Under Governor Corr's rule the mil
â¢ itury and police guards have been re
uuced in size. French doctors are do
i:\g all they can to insure the health
of the natives and the Government
generally to make healthy and happy
the lot of its lazy subjects.
The Oceanic steamship Company's
â¢Iin^r Mariposa, Captain Rennie, ar
rived yesterday from Papeete with a
cargo of tropical products and twenty
eight passengers. Many of the pas
sengers have been to the South Seas
. In search of rest. They were all suc
cessful in their quest- W. R. Alber
ceF of \iie Santa Fe, who left here
â¢ weary with many months at his desk,
returned yesterday looking as if he
hadn't done a stroke of work for
thirty years.
C. York, R. Brown and J. Smith,
who came up on the Mariposa, are
musicians and are going to the St.
Louis Exposition.
The yacht Lurline was at Papeete
tv hile the Mariposa was there. She
made a record run from Honolulu to
the Tahiti port. H. II. Sinclair, who
now owns thÂ» Lurline, has with him
Â«jrr this South Sea cruise his wjfe and
daughter. L. B. Freeman of this city
is Sinclair's guest. The Lurline ar
rjved at Papeete April 19 and May 14
sailed for Samoa.
The Mariposa's cargo included 21,
670 cocoanuts, vanila, copra, shells,
be.eswax and furgrus.
Among the passengers were the fol
lowing::
W. R. Alberger, E. Brauit. Mrs. C.

officially in the early part of nex<f
month by Great Incohonee Thomas G.
Harrison of Indianapolis and Great
Chief of Records Wilson Brooks of
Illinois. The Great Incohonee was in

that time stated on taking his de
parture that there was one thing he
wanted to do before being called from
this sphere and that was to return to
California and in that way show his
appreciation of the hospitality then
shown him. It is in the fulfillment of.
that expressed desire that ne will visit
this "reservation of Red Men." He

That was a pretty affair, the nuptials
of charming-Miss Arnold of Berkeley
and young Charlie Elllnwood. A year is
a long time to waitâ long' for Importu
nate loversâ and having been betrothed
for some months they threw the meas
ure of time to the winds and wedded,
without maids, without music, without
mammas. Their little romance was
somewhat slow reaching the world. It
was on Wednesday that Judge Daniels
performed the ceremony. Since then
the happy' couple have been stopping at
the Palace, and next week will depart
for the up-country ranch belonging to
Mr, 1 Ellinwood. The young bride is a
handsome girl and. is possessed of a
fine personality. And who ever ques
tioned young Ellinwood's good looks?
A handsome pair, asuredly.
Now, what do you suppose is the
cause' of this mighty effort? Why, the

the wicked mosquito forever from the

mosquitoes gone. Success, ladles!

I MISS GERTRUDE DUTTON. THE
ANXOUN'CEMENT OF WHOSE EN
GAGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE.
Section 5. AH orders and ordinances
and parts of orders and ordinances con
flicting with the provisions of this or
dinance are hereby repealed.
Section 6. This ordinance shall take
effect and be in force from and after
its passage.
Provided, however, that if the Board
of Police Commissioners shall refuse
to grant any such permit, an appeal
may be taken from such ruling to the
Board of Supervisors and if- in the
Judgment of* the Board of Supervisors
the said license should be Issued, they
shall authorize the Tax Collector to
issue such license; and provided fur
ther, that- upon conviction of a- felony
or of a violation of any law pertaining
to the sale of liquor, any permit and
the license issued thereon shall be re
voked.
Section 4. Every firm," person or cor
poration violating any of -the provi
sions of this ordinance shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction thereof shall be punished
by a fine not exceeding $500, or by im
prisonment not exceeding six months,
or by both such fine and Imprisonment.
Section 2. Every person, firm or cor
poration engaged in the business of
selling liquors to be drunk on the prem
ises, shall pay a license as follows:
Firstâ Those making fiales to the
amount of $15,000 and over per quar
ter, shall pay a license of $11 per quar
ter.
Second â Those making sales of less
than $15,000 per quarter, shall pay a
license of $21 per quarter.
Section 3. The Board of Police Com
missioners shall investigate the appli
cations of all persons for licenses to
engage in the business of selling liquor
to be drunk on the premises and if the
applicant has been a resident of said
city and county for two years continu
ously preceding the date of such ap
plication, and has not been convicted
of a felony, or of a violation of any
law pertaining to the sale of liquor,
said Board of Police Commissioners
shall grant to such applicant a permit
to engage in said business and there
upon the Tax Collector shall be au
thorized to issue such license.
RIGHT OF APPEAL.
The ordinance to be introduced at to
morrow's meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors by Supervisor Hocks, provid
ing that an appeal may be taken to the
Board of Supervisors from the Police
i Commissioners, when the latter refuse
to grant a permit to sell liquors to any
reputable applicant, will also provide
for an increase in the liquor license.
The ordinance plans two rates of
licensesâ one of $41 per quarter when
the sales are more than $16,000 per
quarter, and one of $21 per quarter
when the sales are less than $15,000 per
quarter. The ordinance follows:
Ordinance providing regulations and
restrictions for the sale of liquor. Be
it ordained by the people of the City
and County of San Francisco as fol
lows:
Section 1. The number of persons,
firms and corporations engaged in the
business of selling liquor to be drunk
on the premises, shall at no time ex
ceed the number so engaged in said
business on the 1st day of January,
1904.
SPECIFIES LICENSE.
"By wise charter provision it is not
required that the entire issue of bonds
should be sold at once. Only such a
number of bonds is required to be sold
as may be necessary to raise money
to carry forward the improvements as
they progress, and should the amount
authorized to be sold be in excess of
the requirements no more need be. sold.
This avoids the payment of interest on
bonds the sale of which is not Imme
diately required, and makes it possible
to entirely escape from liability for
such bonds as are not required to be
sold.
"After an existence of little more
than half a century the city of San
Francisco finds itself with 400,000 popu
lation. Without any bonded indebted
ness whatsoever and at that poUIt in
its municipal development where inter
nal municipal improvement is essential
to its continued growth and prosperity.
Successful as it has been in an attempt
to keep abreast of its growth, it is nev
ertheless a fact that it is to-day with
out adequate schoolhouses for the edu
caption of its youth, and with those in
use in a dilapidated and unsanitary
condition, entirely without a modern
hospital for the care of Its sick, and the
health of its inhabitants is constantly
menaced by an imperfect and illy con
ceived sewer system. Its public parks
have been found unequal to the rapid
increase in population, and if it is ever
going to increase its facilities for pop
ular recreation such increase must be
attempted at a time when realty values
admit of the acquisition of land for
such purposes without an unreasonable
public expenditure . therefor. In short,
in the issue of this case depends the
question whether San Francisco, the
metropolis of the West, shall throw
off the cRaracteristics and "Ihe incon
veniences of a fourth-class city and
take her position as her future and
population warrant as a modern me
tropolis of the first class. It is not too
much to expect that something more
than technical objections to the pro
gressive step about to be taken will be
required to arrest her progress."
On motion of City Attorney Long the
Supreme Court yesterday agreed to
take up In the first week in June the
case of Herbert K. Law against the city
and county of San Francisco to deter
mine the legality of the bond issue for
municipal improvements voted upon at
a recent election. The date for the
hearing will be set to-morrow. The
brief on argument for the respondents
was filed by City Attorney Long and
Assistant City Attorney Brobeck, and
concludes:

ADVERTISEMENTS.
XEWMAN* & IJ2VINSON.Ralph McFadden, a Stanford Tackle,
Administers a Severe Beating to
Men who Assaulted Stranger, i
MENLO PARK. May 21.â When five
roughs attacked an unoffending stran
ger on the county road Friday night
they thought they had everything their
own way. " Th<jy failed to reckon on the
presence of a Stanford* varsity tackle
and when accounts were settled the
football player was uninjured, save for
a slight - scratch on his cheek, while
the others were put completely out of
business. I
A. S. Pomeroy, the stranger attack
ed, claims that he was peaceably
drinking at the "Bungalow" bar, when
the rowdies picked a fight with him.
He was badly bea'ten and, staggering
out into the road, he called for help.
Ralph McFadden. '04, with a friend,
was returning from a call at Fair
Oaks, and they threw themselves into
the fray. When lights were brought
the roughs were all more or less stun
ned, and two had broken noses. ;
McFadden made the varsity football
team in 1900, his freshman year. He
was the star in '01 and '02, and only
his absence from the university last
fall prevented his showing up in even
better shape in this year's game.

! SANTA CRUZ, Hay 21. â This was
college day at the Capitola Students*
Conference and all the trains carried
into the resort scores of students. The
field day exercises were held at Glen
Beulah and shortly after two groups
of bright co-eds wended their way
toward the grounds. The blue and
gold of Berkeley and the cardinal of
Stanford predominated.
The first feature was a game of bas
ket ball between the northern and
southern institutions. Dr. S. S. Sal
isbury of Los Angeles, president of
the State Homeopathic Medical So
ciety, and Dr. Mary A. Rltter and Dr.
Susan Fenton of Berkeley, Mrs. Dr.
Eddy of New York City, Mrs. Addi
son, wife of Professor Addison of the
State University, and Mrs. C. Brad
ley, wife of Professor Bradley of the
same institution, formed a hospital
corps, all bearing around the arm the
band of white with the red cross. The
rooters were divided Into the reds and
the yellows and assembled at each end
of the tennis court.
The game was well played. The
northern players were the red and the
southern the yellow. At the end of
the second half the score was a tie,
7 to 7. The line-up was as follows:
Reds â Goals, Anna Laird, San Jose
State Normal; Lucy Brannln, Univer
sity of Nevada; center. Miss Humph
ery, University of Nevada; guards,
Olive Kelso and Winnie Giffin of Po
mona College.
Yellows â Goals, Miss Haywards and
Helen Salisbury of Stanford Univer
sity; centers, Mae Tripp and Miss
Garston of Stanford University;
guards, Olive Wise and Gertrude
Holmes, Mills College. Umpire â Clara
Tibbetts,. Whittier College. Time keep
er â Gussle Randall, Willamette. Line
man â Helen Chandler.
After the result of the game was,
announced there were college yells
and high jinks. Then appeared the
baseball nines in a contest between
the conference leaders and State sec
retaries. The game afforded great
amusement, the reds, the conference
leaders, winning over the yellows by
a score of 14 to 9. During the prog
ress of the game p. farce was enacted.
One of the players fell to the ground
and was carried off the field on the
stretcher. Her arm was dressed by t the
hospital corps. The line-up of the
baseball nines follows: f
Reds â Conference Leader Ruth
Paxton of New York, of the American
College, captain and catcher; Agnes
Elliott, Los Angeles, pitcher; Miss
Bertha Conde of Chicago, American
College, first base; Miss Gertrude
Barker of Berkeley, a returned mis
sionary from India, second base; Miss
Shields of Los Angeles, third base;
Miss Cloe Anderson, Stanford Univer
sity, shortstop; Miss Elizabeth Cole,
State secretary of Illinois, right field;
Miss Thersa Wilbur, Stanford Univer
sity, left field; Miss Anna Mills, Stan
ford University, center field.
Yellows â Young Women's Christian
Association Secretary Miss Clara
Berryman of the city association, Los
Angeles, catcher; Mrs. Cooley, Los An
geles, pitcher; Mrs. Henderson, Los
Angeles, first base; Miss Brown, U.ni
versity of California, second base; Miss
Mary Bently, University of California,
third base; Miss Edith Parsons, State
Normal School, San Jose, shortstop;
Miss Florence Hammond, Stanford
University, right field; Miss Moyer,
Sacramento, left field.
Miss Edith Hatfleld of Berkeley was
in charge of the field day.
At 10 o'clock the State conference
of California and Nevada was called to
order. # Mrs. Matthus of Log Angeles
was elected chairman; Miss Olive
Wise, University of Nevada, secretary,
and Miss Edith Parsons of the State
Normal School at San Jose, assistant
secretary. , i
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 21.âThe last hour
| of the week's trading In stocks was
; the most animated and the strongest
of the whole week. The day's mod
erate gains were sufficient to decide
j the average for the week's movement
! on thfi side of gains. The bank state
; ment proved^ an agreeable surprise and
i impelled a lively buying movement,
i which lifted prices smartly. The move
! ment waa sudden, and had not spread
! far in the list when the close of the
! session put an end to It. The closing
; was strong and near the top level. The
I rather spasmodic movement In one or
two stocks indicated some" distress on
the part of surprised shorts. An Inkling
of the heavy reduction in the loan item
got abroad before the publication of
the bank statement and started the
buying movement. The loan reduction
is pretty clearly due to the resort of
the exchange market to the selling of
long bills, the proceeds of which have
been lengthened, presumably displac
ing loans with the banks. The process
involves borrowing In London to meet
Â¦ the sterling bills when they mature
! there. It is evident, therefore, that the
export of gold is no longer profitable
as a simple exchange operation, and
the early termination of the out
ward movement of gold la be
lieved to be thus foreshadowed. The
limitation of the cash decrease
of the banks to $7,085,300 in the
week, of the record exports of $15,500,000
' in gold, is convincing evidence of the
effective off-setting factors to the drain
which is in operation, and the net re
sult is to leave the surplus reserve of
the banks unimpaired.
Total sales of bonds, $980,000.
The listless drift of prices of. stocks
, is the Index of the formless state of
speculative sentiment over the outloojc
for values. The outflow of gold may
be accounted for by special causes,
| primarily the Panama canal payment
! and the American subscriptions to the
Japanese and Russian loans. It is now
freely conceded that the proceeds of
the subscriptions are to be remitted in
? full to London. These three items
would call for about $80,000,000 In the
exchange market. It seems probable
that the net results of the gold export
movement will prove small. It is point
ed out that the large reduction in Gov
ernment deposits with banks has re
leased a corresponding amount of Gov
ernment bonds which" were used to se
cure tho deposits and has caused a fall
in the market price:
Railroad traflic officials are generally
agreed that the outlook for a revival
of traffic is not bright before the fall,
and reports have been received of ex
tensive plans of retrenchment by the
railroads to offset the losses in gross
earnings. Reports of railroad earnings
as they come to hand fully bear out
the opinion expressed of the declining
tendency of earnings, and the effect
has been depressing on railroad stocks.
Advices from the iron and steel trade
agree in anticipating a quiet season
in the trade. The crop news of, the
week has failed to afford any support
for stocks. (
The bond market was almost equally
dull and sluggish with stocks.
United States 2s, 3s and the old 4s
have declined Vi per cent on call dur
ing the week.

LONDON, May 21. âTire contrac
tors' men who are at work in Spring
gardens have struck what", waa at first
believed to be a part of the great lake
which underlies London.
â¢ Engineers, however, after investiga
tion, have come to the conclusion that
the water is too near the surface to
come from the lake, and that it is the
output of the old spring from which
the place takes its name.
"This vast underground lake," said
a prominent engineer, "extends not
only under the whole of London, but
as far as Westerham on the one side
and St. Albans on the other. It is a
natural reservoir which, in London, is
being gradually depleted.
"Private individuals alone take from
it by means of artesian wells 10,000,
000 gallons of water a day, and It ia
calculated that in consequence the
level of the lake drops every year from
twelve to eighteen Inches.
"Breweries, too, absorb a large
quantity of this water supply.
"There is no dancer in future years
of any subsidences occurring through
the â¢ exhaustion of the water, as its
presence or absence has no effect on
the soil above."
The depth at which the water. is
struck by well sinkers varies. In Tot T
tÂ«;nham Court road it was found at
1750 feet and in London Wall it waa
reached at 450 feet, underlying strata
of chalk, flint, gray sand and surface
clay.

GRENOBLE, May 21. â The first
chamber of the civil tribunal of this
district has at last rendered its de
cision in the suit of the state against
the Carthusian monks regarding the
ownership of the secret for making
chartreuse and of the trade-mark of
the cordial. The liquidator of the prop
erty of the mopks, which was seized
by the Government, claimed that not
only the real estate but also the trade
mark of the famous liquor was the
property of the congregation and there
fore had now become the property of
the state.
Father Rey, the successor of Father
Gamier, the original owner of the se
cret, contended that the whole estab
lishment, including the trademark, was
his own private property, although he
admitted a business partnership with
the religious order.
The court decided that both the plant
and trademark had always belonged
to the order, and as such it had now
become the property of the Govern
ment, as the congregation had no
longer any legal standing. But Father
Rey has the secret, and In spite of the
court order will not give it up. The
Carthusians have started a new es
tablishment in Spain and are making
the famous liquor there. If the Greno
ble decision be sustained, as it prob
ably will be. chartreuse cannot be sold,
at least under that name, in France.
But the Government has -won an
empty victory, for It has not the se
cret of manufacture, nor can it get it.
and it has succeeded only in driving
the distillery to Spain and thus cut
ting off its own revenue from the tax
on the liquor.

cab and landed in a Held close to the
roadbed.
It required the efforts of a wrecking
crew until 3 o'clock this morning to re
place the engine and car on the rails
and to clear the track.
ALAMEDA May 21.â Through the
ditching of a locomotive and caboose on
the narrow gauge line near "West San
Leandro last evening at Sso'clock, three
members of the crew narrowly escaped
being killed, all being slightly injured.
The accident, it is thought, was caused
by a defective rail. Conductor George
Ely v.as in charge ef the engine and
car that were returning from Alvarado,
where some repairing was being done
to a trestle.
NEW YORK, May 21.â The Financier
says: The notable feature of the of
ficial statement of the New York Asso
ciated Banks last week was the large
liquidation, the greatest for the year,
in loans, which, together with the loss
in cash, caused a reduction in the gen
eral deposits and consequently in the
reserve requirements as to bring about
a small Increase in the surplus reserve.
The loans decreased $22,375,100. prob
ably the result of the cancellation of
loans of Government deposits and also
the repayment of some of the recent
syndicate borrowings. The holdings of
public funds were reduced $6,098,400
during the week, making a reduction in
the fortnight of J23.283.000. This, it may
be noted, is somewhat in excess of the
amount of the surrenders to the treas
ury of the funds which were accumu
lated in the special depositaries pre
paratory to the Panama payment, the
excess representing surrenders under
the second call of the treasury for pub
lic deposits. The cash holdings of the
banks decreased $7,035,300 net, reflecting
the total amount of gold withdrawn for
export to Europe during the bank week.
The average gain resulting from the
payment on Friday of the $3,000,000
treasury warrants to the fiscal agents
of the republic of Panama was so com
paratively small, it counting for only
about $1,500,000, as they have little in
fluence except that it caused the cash
item to be made upon rising averages.
General deposits deceased $29,094,300,
which amount is $411,100 less than the
sum of the decrease in loans and of the
net los in cash; therefore the staetment
showed a good balance. The required
reserve of 2a per cent of general de
posits decreased $7,262,323, deducting
from which the net loss of cash leit
$172,025 as the increase in surplus re
serve to $13,000,527. Computed upon the
basis of deposits less those of $26,841,400
of public funds, the surplus is $1?.

, WILMINGTON, Del., May 21.âFlog
ged with forty lashes of a cat-o-nine
talls across his bared back. Samuel
Fisher, a negro highwayman, collapsed
at the whipping post at the county
workhouse to-day, and limp and help
less he was dragged part of the way
from the post to the cell in which he
is now serving five years. Fisher held
up a negro woman named Mary De
laney, from whom he stole $1.
Fisher stood for one hour in the pll
lory before he was led to the whipping
post, to which his hands were securely
manacled. He twisted and squirmed
as the lashes fell and cried out in pain
"Oh ".ord, have mercy." "Mercy, mer
cy," he cried from time to time. When
the shackles were loosened the man fell
backward, but was caught by the
guards. As they started across the
Enclosure with him, his limbs became
limp and the guards had to drag him
into a tunnel leading to the cells.
Henry Irons, another negro, passed
an hour In the pillory, and received
thirty lashes for stealing. He suffered
as greatly as did Fisher. *
Altogether sixteen offenders, the
largest number in any one day since
the workhouse was erected, were flog
ged at the pc-st to-day. Five hundred
people witnessed the floggings.
The child was in court to-day. She
is a .pretty miss of 7. Seemingly she
wes very harpy with her foster
parent?, who have brought her up in
ihe belief that they were her father
Hi:d mother. Recently a woman claim-
In? to be the mother has made demands
for the child, and in looking up the
records jt wag discovered that, while
:he adoption had been registered, there
v.as apparently no record of its com
pletion. It was not until an action had
been begun by Hyman to protect the
child he had adopted and the matter
was brought up before Judge Ogden
to-day that it was discovered that
while the case had been registered un
der one number it had been completed
under another. An order was made
rectifying the mistake, and the Ky
mar.s will appear in court next Tues
day in San Francisco with a clear title
to the child.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. May 21.
The mother who abandoned her child
to a foundling asylum in San Fran
cisco !icar!y seven years ago and would
now reclaim it from David and LIIHe
Hyman will find that they have a per
fect title to the child. The title was
made so to-day by an order from Judge
O*;den straightening out the records
in the case. The mother had sued out
a writ of habeas corpus before Judge
Dunne in San Francisco, and the Hy
:r.ans were cited to bring the child
into court and show cause why she
Fhould rot have the custody of her lit
tje girl.

Kind Act Nearly , Causes Death.
OAKLAND, May 21.â George Max
well, who lives in North Oakland, was
suffering from a headache last night

powder consisted largely of morphine
and so overcame Maxwell that he had

No More Gifts for Teachers.
PARIS, May 2Lâ M. Chaumie, the
French Minister of Public Instruction,
has just sent around a circular putting
a stop to an ancient usage in the ly
ceums, the offering by pupils at the
end of the term of some gift to their
teacher. The Minister, thinks the pro
fessor who receives a present lessens
bis moral control and, leaves himself
open to very humiliating imputations.
The Minister's act was influenced by
complaints from a number of parents.

The markets everywhere continue dull and
unsatisfactory. The Chicago dispatches of
Mitchell, Mulcahy & Co. Â«ay: "Prices are
again a shade lower. It is the same dull mar
ket with a dragging tendency. There Is noth
ing like general liquidation, but enough scat
tered selling by . tired holders and enough
hedging by packers to keep the price dragging.
Provisions are largely owned by scattered out
side speculators, and the packers and distrib
utors do not seem disposed to acquire holdings
or help carry the load. The general expecta
tion is that receipts of Hogs will be > large
through June. The speculative situation Is,
therefore, not a strong one."

CHICAGO, May 21. â Excellent growing
weather and large Australian shipments had a
depressing influence en the wheat market at
the opening, but the uncertainty of the situa
tion in the May, delivery held the bears In
check and prevented any considerable selling.
Initial sales on July showed a loss of %@Uc
at S0%@SC*4c. May was unchanged at 99c.
As the session advanced a number of bullish
factors came into prominence. A statistician
in an estimate of the world's shipments for the
week showed a large falling off. while at the
same time claiming a heavy decrease in the
visible supply. Later there was considerable
purchasing on a belief that the local stocks of
contract wheat would show quite a decrease
on Monday. The predominating influence
however, was the sale of a million bushels of
cash wheat at Minneapolis to country mjHers.
The market closed almost at the top -figures,
final prices for July being 8S%c after the price
had touched 88c. May closed %c higher at
S9%c.
During the early part of the session a bear
ish sentiment was manifested In corn, due to
Ideal weather conditions. Later in the day tho
market became firmer In sympathy with the
strength of wheat. July closed at 48%@4Si4c.
The feature of trading In oats was furnished
by delivery. July closed at 3SV4c
Provisions were easier on selling by packers
and outside liquidation. Lower prices at the
yards were the principal selling motives. Pork
closed 7%c lower, lard was down 2%@5c and
ribs were a shade off.

WHEATâ Chicago advanced and closed
steady. The private report of Mitchell Mul
cahy & Co. from there said: "The tone was
again strong. There is an absence of selling
pressure from long Wheat and the bear ln
te r^* '.' an . y< 8cwns thoroughly cowed. The
whole situation is an unusual one. There is
a strong bullish sentiment on" the small stocks
of contract Wheat. The May Wheat is prac
tically cornered, with, we think, a conslderablo
long interest tailing on. Crop prospects are
Improving dally. The conditions which govern
the market ara almost purely speculative Min
neapolis reports large sales of Wheat to mill
ers yesterday, but in view of the very poor de
mand for Flour it would seem that millers are
providing for future wants more than Imme
diate requirements. The conditions are such
that a nervous and good scalping market for
the immediate future Is -likely, but we think
it Ehould be kept in mind that prices are pretty
high and the movement of the new crop is not
far off."
In this market futures were higher, but the
cash grain, though firm, was unchanged. There
Is a good milling demand for certain grades at
an advance over the quotations. The local
mills are also taking Oregon and Washington
and some Kansas Wheat for blending. There is
now a pood deal of Eastern Oregon and Wash
ington Wheat moving to Chicago on account
of the recent cut In northern overland freights,
which enables the northern Wheat to get a bet
ter price In Chicago than at San Francisco.
CASH WHEAT.

Receipts of Strawberries exceeded 1400
chests and weft the heaviest for the season,
but the market cleaned up better than at any
time during the past week, as the consumptive
demand was stimulated considerably by the
warm weather and the previous low prices.
The best stock cleaned bp quickly at firmer
rates and some buyers paid a small premium '
for selected lots. The canners were still buy- i
Ing the large varieties at the minimum quota-.!
tion, but were unable to secure any great quan
tity. Crates from Florin were being forced for
sale and some poor lots were offered at 15c
per crate. Four crates of Loganberries, the
first of the season, came in from Fowler,
Fresno County. They contained 24 small
baskets each and sold at $2 25@2 50 per crate.
Raspberries from the south sold at 20025c per
small basket and Dewberries brought 74@1<*-
Gooseberries were offering freely and dragged
at easier rates. Cherries continued to arrive
freely and ruled weak, with the top quotation
obtainable only for exceptionally fine lots, 85o
being about the top for the general market.
Two crates of Watermelons, containing 20
melons in all, were received from Hermcsillo.
Mexico. They were large and well matured
and met with quick sale at 75c each. A draw
er of Currants from San Leandro brought $1 60.
The Orange market was weak for general of
ferings, the demand being limited and confined
chiefly to small sizes of fancy fruit. Large
sizes of all grades were being offered freely at
low rates, in some Instances below the quota
tions, but moved slowly, aa buyers were too
busy with Cherries and Berries.

Late mail advices from New York ray
"ANo'jt the only feature of any interest in
this market on Saturday was afforded by tele
graphic advices indicating that the damage
done to the crop cf Oregon Italian Prunes by
unfavorable weather conditions has been very
h<-a\y. In declining a bid of lc basis on five
cars of 40-5fÂ«s and 50-603 a' prominent seller
aysiifns as the reason that he believes that
â¢^tvreÂ»u*e cf the serious injury done the crop it
* wiJI not be 20 per cent of that of last year.
fio far the spot market has not been affected.
Stock is paid to be procurable on the spot here
* . on a lc basis, but we do not hear that more
than raising interest is shown by buyers, and
etle* are on the Jobbing order. Hanta Clara
i'rum-s of good quality are selling in small
â¢ leu on the Â«â¢:Â¦.! on a 2%4c basis. The demand
h*s ithown cor.slderable Improvement during
the past few daye. but buyers are interested
only In covering the wants of the moment. The
market still has an easy undertone and prices
vary according to seller and quantity. A rery
fair jobbin? demand is noted for Apricots and
Reaches, but larger lots seem to offer no at
tractions to buyer*. Stocks are moderate and
are held -with confidence, as it Is claimed that
they cannot be replaced from the coast at
. prices now ruling here. Occasional sales of
carload lots of outside loose Raising for ship
ment from the etian at about a quarter of a
cent under association rrtces are reported, but
the bulk of the business passing here at pres
ent in in *mall lots to keep up assortments.
and most of the pales are of seeded stock at

gether with the appearance of Los Angeles
in this market as a liberal buyer, have cut
down spot stocks to such a degree that the
receivers are enabled to do better with the

are calling for cubes, hence a large portion of
the current receipts are In the form of cube3.

still excessive. %
The prevailing hot weather has a tendency
to strengthen ranch and weaken store Eggs,

there is little variation, however, though there
is more steadiness observable in ranch descrip

The stock week closed with a much better
feeling in Wail street, due to the unexpected
r*od showing made by the bank statement.
The private advice* of Mitchell. Mulcahy &
Co. Â«ald: '"The bank statement has fooled the
.whole street and produced a decidedly bullish
reaction, with many predictions of a better
market. -.The recent brarith views are being
c.ofiifled. It is the imr-ression that gold ex
'jicrts are Rearing their end and that we have
Â¦ eeen the worst of the bank statements."
â¢ The cause of this rather amusing revulsion
In e^rjtlment was a decrease of $22,000,000 !n
loses. It may bÂ«? remarked In passing that it
.was accompanied by a decrease of $29.000,00<Â»

Trade in miscellaneous vegetables was
brisk, aa usual on Saturday, and previous
prices ruled for most descriptions. Receipts
of Asparagus still exceeded trade wants and
surplus stocks were, bought up by, the can
ners. who paid i\bc for No. 2 and 0c per
round for No. 1. Peas did better under de
creased receipts and some fancy lots of garden
commanded a premium. The canners secured
a small quantity at or near the minimum quo
tation. Egg Plant and Summer Squash from
the south were weaker. Cucumbers were re
ceived from Arizona - and sold within the
quoted range.
POTATOES â Burbanks from the river, $1Â®
1 20 per ctl; Oregon Burbanks, $1 20(gl 60
per ctl; River Reds, $1@1 10 per ctl; small

new Potatoes. lÂ«4Jf2c per lb.
ONIONS â Australian Yellow. $5 per ctl: new
Red, 85c@$l per sack; new Green, 25@3oc per
box.
The Potato market continued very weak, as
stocks of old Burbanks are unwieldy and the
receipts of new are increasing every day. Deal
ers v.-ere Inclined- to force sales of . old stock
and large buyers could have bought at con
cessions. . Occasional sales of new 'were re
ported at a slight advance over the top quo
tation, but the general market was weak and
there was a liberal quantity on hand at the
close. New Onions were weak and prices had
a further decline.

In the twist of a twinkle the bril

night. At the -time Harvey thought
he had been "touched" for his watch.
The watch was in its customary place
and when he felt for It and found it
safe he grave no thougrht of his other
valuables until he arrived at his des

the-- pretense of wishing to get out of
the car. By the manner of the men
his suspicions were aroused and he
'instinctively felt for his watch. Find

way.
When he discovered the loss of his
valuable pin he telephoned to his
home to ascertain whether or not he
had left It on his dressing case, but
being assured by his wife that he had
the pin on when he left home he ac
cepted the Inevitable and realized he
had been robbed.
