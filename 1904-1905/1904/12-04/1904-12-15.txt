Two Women.
8:wÂ»ei2.1 Dispatch to Tbe Call
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.â Mrs. Margaret
Young:, widow of "Caesar" Young, to
day faced the woman charged with her
husband's murder. Her appearance on
the witness stand marked the climax
of the case for the prosecution against
"Nan" Patterson. She was called to
identify a letter addressed to Young by
Mrs. Julia Patterson Smith, "Nan"
Patterson's sister, containing an im
plied threat. Mrs. Smith called Young
"Dear Nunk." and warned him that
"Nan" Patterson was in a desperate
frame of mind and that unless he
called to see her there was no telling
what she would do.
"Nan" Patterson had given many
evidences of her extreme nervousness
during the day, and when Mrs. Young's
name was called every vestige of color
fled from her face. She was livid as
she clutched her father's left hand, and
h* -again platted Mia riphi. arm around
fcvr shoulders. There was a long delay,
cs the widow had been permitted to re
main in Â£he District Attorney's office,
on an opr>er floor of the building. Theri
a. side door opened and Mrs. Young ap
peared, dressed entirely in black, with
& mourning veil hanging from her hat.
As she walked slowly to the witness
stand and in a low voice took the sol
emn oath to tell only the truth she did
not seem to notice the slighter figure
in- black facing her. The spectators
could not avoid making comparisons
between the two, and it was In the
widow's favor.
Mrs. Young i* tall and handsome,
vith strong features and a pleasing
expression, while her one-time rival
in "Caesar" Young's affections is frai!
physically, with a small face and a
prettiness that is somewhat childish.
Her teeth are tiny and her light blue
eyes are very small.
Although she was on the stand only
long enough to identify the letter, Mrs.
Young's presence developed one of the
most intense situations of the trial.
Miss Patterson, deathly pale, watched
Intently every movement of the wit
ness during her brief examination.
Another of Young's brothers-in-law,
TYilliam Luce, told to-day of what had
occurred between Young and Miss
Patterson at their meeting 1 in a saloon
the night before Young was killed, and
John Crowley. a cab driver, repeated
his story of having seen Young slap
the prisoner's face during a quarrel
or. the street that same night.
BRILLIANT BALL
FOR HER DEBUT
Jliss Gladys Vanderbilt of
New York Makes Her Bow
to Society of Metropolis
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.â To Introduce
to society her daughter Miss Gladys
Vanderbilt, Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt
to-night threw open the family man-
Eion at Fifth avenue and Fifty-seventh
street, and gave a brilliant dance for
her daughter. The entertainment was
notable, not only from its social im
portance; but also from the fact that
it was the first large entertainment
given by Mrs. Vanderbilt in five years
or more. While in reality ft was the
debut of Miss Vanderbitl. it was not
the only entertainment that will be
griven to her, for Mrs. Vanderbilt will
give a grand ball to mark her daugh
ter's presentation to society on Jan r
uary 13. V , v
Although styled a "small dance,"
to-night's entertainment was to all in
tentjs and purposes a ball, and by no
means informal, as it would be out of
the question to bo style so splendid
an entertainment. Miss Vanderbllt,
while yet at her studies, is quite as
much out in society as the other young
women of her age. as she has been
frequently at the cpera this winter and
also at other entertainments.
While it was the intention of the
hostess to confine her invitations to the
younger married people and to those of
the young dancing set, there were not
a few of the older members of society
present. Many elegant costumes were
eeen. - ... . â  â  . â¢ â¢ -

POLICE COMMISSIONER HUTTON dis
1 covers that women of the half world are con
tributing enormous sums of money- to officers
in uniform at the entrances to their brothels. Pa
trolman John Dean collects one day's- toll and
turns the coin over to his superior. \Pacific street,
Hincklcy alley, Belden place, 1 1 29 Dupont street
and Bacon place are said to pay more than $5000
a month for "protection." Some of the guilty
public servants arc alleged to be known, and for
mal investigation of the wholesale corruption
in the red light district is promised.
Immense Conspiracy
Is Alleged to Exist
MONEY WIDELY DISTRIBUTED
Parties to Investigation.- Aice
Very Secretive.
Another disgraceful scandal has come
to light in the Police Department. The
fallen women of the tenderloin are pay
ing immense sums for "protection,"
and the uniformed guardians of the
peace are acting as collectors of the
shameful tax. Police Commissioner
Hutton has uncovered the criminal
facts. An official investigation of the
matter is on the tapis. The central
figures In the sensational expose are
Hutton and Patrolmen John Dean
and Samuel Higgins.
The toll was extorted from the mis
erable inmates of Bacon place Tuesday
night, and proof of the transaction is
forthcoming. Hinckley_ alley, Belden
place, J12S Dupont street- and .Pacific
street have all been contributing large
sums to the police. In Bacon- place
alone the average dally -payment has
ranged fronr$36_rd~$5Q.. according to ttor
number of women occupying cribs.
â¢ As the -men on these details were
changed daily- the conspiracy, among
the members of the department must
have been widespread. Each day the
fund has been gathered and disbursed.
Every inmate of the dens of infamy at
Bacon place and 1129 Dupont street Is
said to have paid 50 cents daily, 'j The
women claim that they have the alter
native of paying or being arrested for
vagrancy.
The scandal came to the ears of Hut
ton and he immediately began one of
his favorite private investigations. Pa
trolman Dean of the park police sta
tion was selected by the Commissioner
to demonstrate -the truth or' falsity of
the report of the shameful taxation.
Tuesday night the policeman was de
tailed to watch Bacon place by Captain
Gleason and by Hutton to gather the
toll. He experienced no difficulty in get
ting the corruption fund and turned it
over to the Commissioner.
The latter planned to continue his in
vestigation and verify the reports of
"protection" at the other â¢ brothels,
meanwhile keeping secret the results
of his detective work. But the story of
Tuesday night's affair spread through
the force like wildfire yesterday, and
last night there were no collections.
BIG .SUMS COLLECTED.
Whether the individual policemen
who have exacted the tax each day
kept the total amount or turned over
a part of It to others higher in author
ity is the principal thing that Hutton
is anxious to discover. The aggregate
sum gathered monthly from the resorts
mentioned is alleged to exceed $5000.
Hutton exr>ects to be able to show to
whom the funds were paid.
Reports that "protection" taxes were
paid by fallen women have been spread
during many years. Occasionally some
policeman has been brought to task on
this charge and dismised br trans
ferred to the "tog belt." Proof of the
illegal transactions between members
of the police force and the women of
the half -world has always been .diffi
cult to secure. Of. late the abandoned
women and their consorts have been
complaining that the tax has been in
creased and extended to cover practi
cally every member of the clique. When
the unfortunates refused or were-un
able to pay, they are said to have been
arrested, charged wllth vagrancy and
usually sentenced to Jail. Thus the
levy was enforced.
In Bacon place the dally offering was
collected by the "hops," as the alley's
errand boys are called. They turned it
over to the police on duty.' it is
charged. The policemen are said to have
pocketed the coin and that is the last
the contributors know of,lt The stories
of corruption had of course tome to
headquarters, and to prevent any one
policeman from getting well acquainted
with the inmates of _the brothels the
detail was changed e"very twenty-four
hours. . In spite of this move the toll
was collected each day, as before.
Higgins and Dean were detailed from
the North End. and Park stations, re
spectively. Tuesday. Higgins was not
apprised of the fact that anything un
usual was planned. Both performed the
usual duty of taking the names of men
who entered the alley until after night
fall. 'â : Then Dean accomplished the spe
cial task assigned him by Hutton. .
Higgins is reported to -have taken
some of the money and to have subse
quently refused to . surrender, it to the
Police Commissioner. -He, denies abso
lutely that he hÂ«s seen any kind 'of
money for a week, and is surprised to
learn that dissolute women contribute
to the private Incomes of policemen.
Higgins has been a member of the force
Bince ; July, ' 1902. ' - He ' is married, has
several children" and is generally well
thought of. His record in : the deoart
ment" has : been without a blemish.
Dean" is an , exrsoldier, who " has lived
In San Francisco for, the last five years."
He was taken on the force" last October,
andi is well liked > by his superiors.- Hig
gins' usual beat is on Sutter land Post
streets, -j betwjjp- Jones and- Steiner.

tween Steiner and Stanyan. .
THE NEWS SPREADS.
Tuesday evening news was spread
through the tenderloin that Hutton was
abroad. Women ceased: to solicit,
music was shut. off in the saloons all
along the Barbary Coast and the half
world assumed a quiet appearance.
The embargo had not been raised again
last night and the inhabitants of the
lower social levels are awaiting for
something to happen before resuming
activities.
Policemen Reade and O'Connell suc
ceeded Dean and Higglns on the detail
at Bacon place Tuesday night and
Hammill and Hostetter. had the watch
yesterday." The .four, .officers, last
named .had all;- received : word, of the
investigation by Hutton, "Special Chief
of Police for 1129 Dupont street." and
they were surprised -to find that there
was corruption In the red light dis
trict- â¢â¢' V./'V.: â -.*V : A-:'."-'" â¢-. â :â ;
Hutton declined to speak of the mat
ter last", evening although he admitted
that: there were "doings" in Bacon
place twenty-four hours before. Dean
was wildly alarmed over the erroneous
story that ran through the Police De
partment to the effect that he had been
caught red-handed . In the act of tak
ing marked coin from some of the in
mates of the alley. He said Hutton
would clear him of any- such charge,
but refused, to tell about the arrange
ment he had made with the Commis
sioner to uncover the graft. â¢ Dean re
flected sadly that Higgins had a fam
ily, but could not trust himself to tell
anything about his brother, policeman.
Higgins denied that he had done any
wrong and evinced great willingness to
answer any and all questions that the
Police Commissioners might choose to
ask him. He denied absolutely that he
had seen Hutton in Bacon place Tues
day night. Both policemen reported off
at the' usual time and were on their
regular beats yesterday. No "'money
was collected from the fallen women
last night. . It.Js alleged, that Hutton
has positive evidence* against certain
members of the force who have been
engaged In the big graft. A

NEW YORK, Dec. 14.â A practical
Joker sent the: following telegram t 0
Thomas W. Lawson to-day, to test the
Boston man's nerve:
"Thomas W. Lawson, State street,
Bostonâ Leave for Boston â  on 10 a. m.

Within a few. minutes. back came a
message from Lawson, selecting as the
place of meeting the scene of the Bos
ton massacre of revolutionary times.
Here is Lawson's telegram:
"W. C. Greene, on board 10, a; m.

H. H. Rogers, chief â  stock., market
agent for the Standard Oil party, came
publicly to the rescue of Colonel Greene
to-day, in his fight with Lawson. It
was announced that Standard Oil
money would take care of the stock of
the Greene Consolidated Copper Com
pany and the bears were invited to sell
It without fear that Colonel Greene
would threaten to call at their offices.
The stock rose from $25 to 527 50.
It was officially reported : that '.the
control of the company had been hand
ed vover to Rogers by Colonel Greene
during his visit to 26 Broadway on
Monday, while the raid on his stock
was at its worst. E. H. Harriman,
whom Greene named as the largest
stockholder outside of himself, is ba
lieved to have acted for Rogers " in
buying the stock.
Safe from further financial ; storms.
Colonel Greene announced that he was
sorry he had entered into a competitive
advertisement writing contest with
Lawson.
â¢'Lawson can write better than I
can." said he, as he stroked his curb
hair with the big fat hand that has
*dug copper ore in the West, and made
notches on his pistol in Mexico. "1
was mad.. You would- be mad, too, if
some one made you lose $2,000,000 In
two days.- I don't intend to make any
gun plays. The Lawson incident Â» Is
closed." .
Colonel Greene, in his decision to let
Lawson alone, doubtless felt that one
fight on his hands Is enough. To-day
he sw'ore out a warrant for the arrest
of Frank W. Goodman, who went gun
ning for him last year. Goodman has
been writing more threatening letters
to Greene.

NEW HA VEX. Dec 14.â Dr. Arthur
T. Hadley, president of Tale Univer

was in the thick of an exciting strug
gle between several men and his quar
ry.- Three students whom Dr. Hadley
summoned to^his assistance also knew
they had been In a tussle. Charles F.
Porter, the visitor, was so exhausted
and breathless that he had to be sup
ported by detectives when placed under
arrest. ; .
Porter, a man of heavy frame, drove
to Woodbridge Hall in a hack. He Is
tall and weighs about 220 pounds. He
went to Dr. Hadley's office, and, al
though rather poorly dressed, was abis
by dint of excellent manners to be ad
mitted, lie told Dr. Hadley he was
from Denver and that for some time
he had been traveling in thia part of
the country. Just now ne was on his
way from Boston to Syracuse. Porter
added that his father, now dead, was
graduated from Tale sixty-five or more
years ago.
. Soon Porter remarked that he found
himself short of funds and hoped that
Dr. Hadley could v lend him $10 or so.
Dr. Hadley excused himself to consult
the university record as to Porter's
father's Tale antecedents. Not finding
that the man's story tallied .with the
alumni record. Dr. Hadley. again ques
tioned Porter and then telephoned to
detective headquarters for aid. Porter
decided it was time to go, but In the
hall Dr. Hadley caught and held him.
Porter fought viciously. Three students
came to Dr. Hadley's aid, and finally
they overpowered him. Porter wu ax
rested for vagrancy.2

Enough the dense Crowd* to' a carriage
i waiting. . . - â¢-â¢- ~\t. .
Although in her own city, no friendly
lace greeted her at the car,, and Mrs.
chadwick stepped Jhto .h^r"-carriage as*
is' she had been an entire- stranger to
this community. 'As sooii/as-. she was
recognized by the crowd : there was a
spontaneous outburst of cheers, whistles
and shouts of coarse epithets. Not until
the police were called, Mpon could the
efflcers attempt to.^conduct!; their pris
oner to the carriage in Raiting. Shouts
of "Here's the notorious V'iand "Where's
the money?** greeted -Mrs. Chadwick
upon her appeara'nee. 'and as the
viciousness of the mÂ»b dawned upon
her she seemed to grow faint and wav
ered, as though about -to. fall.
* The arrival of the woman was spec
tacular in every respect. As soon as
the oolice could clear a way and bring
about some semblance ,of order about
the station platform the officers led
their prisoner toward the gate and out
through the entrance. There the street
was almost blocked and well nigh im
passable to the carriages and teams.
The camera "fiend" was there in all
his glory, despite the overcast sky and
dark day. and through this battery
passed Mrs. Chadwick, Marshal
Chandler and his two deputies to their
carriage. They were immediately driven
to the Federal Luilding.
MOB CONTINUES JEERING.
During all this time the crowd kept
hooting and jeering. The shouts and
cries were taken up and passed
all along the way to the Fed
eral building, through the busiest part
of the city. As the carriages neared
the building the crowds broke into the
streets and many began to run along
side the carriages, expecting to see Mrs.
Chadwick as the entered the building
by the main entrance.
In this the crowd that had assem
bled before the Federal building was
disappointed, for the carriage.with the
prisoner was driven Into an alley in
the rear of the building. There was
much delay here because -of the nar
row passageway being | blocked with
â¢wagons. The crowd already there was
augmented by that which 'had assem
bled before the front of the building
and there was a. veritable blockade.
The police were forced to drive the
crowd away with clubs while they ex
tricated the carriages from the tangle
with the wagons. All this- added to
the excitement and heads were thrust
into the carnages and vulgar expres
sions hurled at the occupants.
After consuming twenty minutes in
going a distance of about twice as
many feet, the prisoner's carriage was
drawn up at the rear of the Federal
building, and, with the officers, she
was taken to the Marshal's office on
the fifth floor on the freight- elevator.
The police continued to beat back the
crowd, and out of the next carriage
the nurse. Freda, was assisted and
taken up to join her mtetrTÂ»ssV -
While -Mrs. Chadwick with her" nurse'
was in the Federal buildmg. Emil, in
the carriage outside, was subjected to
the scrutiny of the mob and was forced
to listen to anathemas and maledic
tions as *veJl as sarcastic ;and bitter
references to "notes/? "diamonds"
â¢securities" and the like. The insults
and jeer? were not confined +to rone
class. They seemed to be heartily
teken up by every one. on the streets
and in the neighborhood. Even the
clerks in the postoffice. working on the
ground floor of the building, flocked to
a rear door, located' next to the' one
entered by Mrs. Chadwick, and laugh
ingly shouted. "Let's see the securi

The fire started in the photographic

of its kind in the Northwept.

controlled the automatic sprinkler

stant the whole building from top to
bottom burst into flames. The sprink

live heavy current wire. The three" men
who were with Fellows succeeded in
making miraculous exits down the fire
escapes.- but Fellows made the fatal
error, of running to the elevator shaft
and sliding down the cable, in the be
lief that the lower part of the. building
had not yet begun to burn. He slid on
to 'a cauldron of flame and was seen
no more.

Army Prisoners Who Broke
Out of Rodeo Inclosure
Captured by Provost Guard
INSPECTS EIFLE EANGE
General MacArthur Pro
npunces New Experiment
to Be Complete Success
Three of the military prisoners who
broke through the stockade at the Ro
deo rifle range on Monday were cap
tured yesterday at Ignacio, near San
Rafael. They were .Richard Wells,
Donald/Thome andCIaude Paumapeer.
Constaile George 'Agnew and M. Mc-
Namara. who were on the lookout for
the escaped prisoners, espied the three
walking along the- Calitornia North
western Railway, and. arrested them.
They made no I resistance whatever.
They all looked v tired, worn out and
hungry. I
Paumapeer, who is said to have been
the ringleader of the break from the
stockade, said that everything had been
carefully planned to have the whole
100 prisoners make their escape. . Con
ditions, however, .were not favorable,
and instead of the whole gang escaping,
as . was originally planned, only ten
managed to get away. Paumapeer fur
ther added that when he saw the fop:
settle down ' and completely envelop
the camp on Monday afternoon It was
decided, to. make the break at 8:30 in
the evening. Word was passed around
the camp for the gang, to be ready at
the appointed hour. Only ten were
ready for the bolt. The others, were
afraid of being shot down by the guard.
Paumapeer began the attack on the
barbed-wire â  fence with a washboard,
and another prisoner began cutting the
wires with a pair of shears that, had
been' smuggled over from Alcatraz. It
only took a moment to make a hole blc
enough for the men to crawl through.
As' soon as they were In the open they
scampered away into the adjoining
hills, where they spent the nieht.
Tuesday night the runaways com
menced to feel the pangs of hunger,
and one of the gang went to a road
house near San Rafael and got food.
At a farmhouse they stole a pair of
trousers.
\ Major A. R. Paxton, commandant
at Alcatraz, expects that the balandf
of the escaped prisoners will be cap
tured in.< a few days.
The new protected target range at
the Presidio received its first prac
tical test yesterday in the presence of
General MacArthur and was a pro
nounced success. This rifle range was
largely experimental. It was built un
der the supervision of Captain Charles
R. Howland and has been under con
struction for the last four months.
The o ( utcome of this experiment has
been looked forward to with great in
terest throughout the entire United
States army. Now that the tests have
proved to be an unequivocal success,
similar ranges will be constructed at
th^ different ' posts throughout the
country. Besides General MacArthur
and. his aid, Captain Frank li. Winn,
ther.e were present all, the leading of
ficers stationed at the Presidio and
GeneralMoore and his aid, Lieutenant
Creed F. Cox, from the department
headquarters.
â¢ Captain Howland made the initial
test by firing the first shot Follow
ing -him came all kinds of experi
mental shooting by enlisted men,
which was highly interesting and edi
fying, to the big crowd of spectators.
% General MacArthur expressed him
self as highly pleased with the results.
The range will be put into practical
use at once and then different troops
now at the post will begin daily prac
tice.
Major Henry M. Morrow, who has
been acting as Judge advocate on the
Rees court-martial at Vancouver,
Wash., has gone to Seattle to look into
the case of Private Stubbs. Stubbs
was accused, of killing an enlisted man
at American Lake during the man
euvers there this summer. He was tried
by the civil authorities and acquitted.
He was then tried by a court-martial
and fund guilty of manslaughter and
sentenced to seven years* imprison
ment. He has now appealed to Judge
Hanford to be released on habeas cor
pus. He claims that the army mu
thorities had no jurisdiction in his
case. .

the Wells-Fargo messenger. After a
week of unrelenting search Deputy
McNabb arrested Jarvis and Swindell
at the Burlingame track near San
Francisco.
On the night of the robbery these
two men, it is alleged, were in the
horse car in front of the express car
which was robbed. â¢ They were in the
employ ot F. J. Mackey, an English
millionaire horse owner, whose hobby
is polo ponies. The two men were em
ployed at Chicago to come west with
the horses and were both on the train
at" the time of the- robbery. â¢ Jarvis
was married on the night before he
left Chicago.
The evidence against the two men Is
said to be very, strong. It has not yet
been determined whether the.prelimi

An Investment of a couple "of million
dollars brooks no delay! If any one en
tertained any doubts as to the seriousness
of this occasion and the urgent necessity
on the part of us tenants of the old
Bishop Building to get rid of our stock
quickly, such doubts were quickly and
thoroughly dispelled by the auction salÂ§
of the balance of the furniture people's
slock next' door during the past two days.
Many who attended this sale saved
enough in the price of their furniture to
buy one of our line .pianos, and many
again, saved enough in the price of the
new piano which they secured at our
present closing out sale to buy a big dray
lo&d of furniture.
This is no idle talkâ but actual factâ as
will be found by any â  one who will but
stop a moment to investigate the condi
tions as they are.
Price cuts little figure now. for we 'must
get rid of this stock no matter what the
sacrifice. ' â¢
Twenty-nine sales of fine pianos and or
gans were recorded at the Pommer-Eilers
Removal Sale on Monday and Tuesday,
and In spite of yesterday's unfavorable
weather the sales by closing time will
foot up more than a dozen.
TEE ESS IS KEAB.
At this rate it will alrnply be out of
question to keep the sale open until the
close of the month, for everything will be
closed out before that time.
There'll, be no more pianos at these cut
prices when the stock now on our main
salesrooms floor is gone.
At the very last minute we decided to
throw into this sacrifice three additional
carloads of Decker and Klmball and
Hazelton pianos which were on the way
when the sale commenced, and every one
of these' choice pianos are marked to sell
at the same reductions in price that has
made this sale the wonder of the -trade
throughout the United States.'
Bear in mind that the total amount of
pianos, and organs- sold since the com
mencement of this sale exceeds $138,000.
and that we wilt' easily reach the $150,000
mark this week.

NAVAL COMBAT
REPORTED BY TOGO
Admiral Is in Doubt as to
the Result of the Tor
pedo Attack Upon the Rus
sian Battleship Sevastopol
TOKIO, Dec. 15 (noon)â
It is reported that the Japa
nese have successfully tor
pedoed the Russian battle
ship Sevastopol.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE THIRD
JAPANESE ARMY, Dec. 14.â Every
part of the city and harbor of Port Ar
thur is Visible from 203-Meter Hill. The
streets of the city are deserted and but
few soldiers are doing patrol duty.
Many buildings have been burned and
others chattered. The shelters of the
harbor present a strange appearance,
with the turrets, masts and funnels of
warship* showing just above the water.
There is not a vessel afloat in the har
bor. The docks and buildings on the
â water front are torn and burned- The
Japanese shells search every part of
the city and harbor.
The tremendous price in life paid by
the Japanese for the capture of 203-
Meter Hill has been redeemed by the
utter destruction of the Russian fleet.
The Japanese fleet will now go into
dock.
The Japanese are working their ad
vance on the shores of Pigeon Bay on
comparatively level ground against the
Talyankow, Idzchan and 'Antzshan
forts. The approaches to the fortifica
tions are easy, but the forts arÂ», enor
mously strong and the Â«ear approach
will be all tne more difficult, as the
tapping of trenches will have to be
done through frozen ground.
The naval guns mounted on 203-Meter
Hill will be able to cover the advance
of infantry against any of the western
forts.
TOKIO. Dec. 14.â Vire Admiral Togo
W^orts a series of torpedo attacks on

ly r*>sistf-<i the attarks. The results of
th> Â«?xpl<->pions= of the torpedoes have

The rer"rt of Vire Admiral Togo was
received last night. It was a? fol
lows:
â¢"Commander Kasama, commanding
the torpedo flotilla, on Monday at
midnight attacked the Russian battle- i
thip Sevastopol. Iyinf outside Port
Arthur. The rerult of this attack has
not been ascertained. Subsequently
two torpedo boats under Commander
Masado attempted several attacks, fac
ing the enemy's vigorous fire. The
shock of the explosions of torpedoes
Mas felt, but the next day the Sevas
topol remained hi the same position.
Xone of our vessels were damaged.
"On Tuesday, at 2:30 o'clock in the
morning, another torpedo flotilla at
tacked the Sevastopol, but the result
of this attack was not learned. In this
attack a shell from the enemy struck
the funnel of one of our torpedo boats
and another struck the engin; room,
disabling the vessel and she lost her
freedom of motion and was towed
away by her comrades. There were no
casualties.
"Again at 6 o'clock on the morning
of the same day a torpedo flotilla un
jder command of Commander Seki at
tempted an attack, but was exposed
by the enemy's searchlights, and, be
ing subjected to a heary fire, waa un
able to accomplish its purpose.
' "Simultaneously Lieutenant Adachl,
commanding two torpedo boats, ap
proached the enemy's ship and dis
charged torpedoes, which were seen to
explode, but with what effect Is not
known. These a.ttackers also were ex
posed to a heavy fire and each was hit
once and three men were wounded."
The commander of the naval guns
Overlooking Port Arthur, reporting at
â¢ID o'clock on Tuesday night, says:
"To-day's bombardment was princi
pally directed against the arsenal and
torpedo storehouse at Tiger's Tail pen
insula and the vessels anchored in that
vicinity. The storehouse waa set afire
and burned in about an hour. About
six Efcells struck the ships and three

Horrible Spectacle in the Trenches of

HEADQUARTERS OF THE JAP
ANESE THIRD" ARMY, BEFORE
PORT ARTHUR, Dec. 14. â The work
of removing the dead from the crest
of 203-Meter Hill and from the slopes
on the north side of the hill has been
completed. The southern slopes are
still covered with bodies, which are
buried in the debris. In the trenches
and in bombproofs.
The effect of dynamite., used as an
offensive weapon in the form of a
grenade, was instanced in an appalling
manner by the condition of the dead.
Long lines of Japanese bodies laid out
on a slope of the hill previous to in
terment presented an awful appear
ance. JCearly all had been horribly
torn by the dynamite.
An unrecognizable mass of flesh and
bones, fragments of hundreds of
killed, unearthed from the fllled-In
Russian trenches and piled up on a
slope of the hill, presented a scene of
horror never to be forgotten.
The heavy timbers and steel plates
of the bombproofs were torn to splin
ters by shells and dynamite bombs.
COST OF SIEGE TO JAPAN.
Englishman Says Port Arthur Is Not
Worth the Price.
CHICAGO, Dec. 14.r-"WIth the fall of
Port Arthur the Russians will have
achieved a great victory and the Jap
anese will have lost a great opportu
nity.-"ln maintaining the siege the Jap
anese have lost 75,000 men. They will
lose 25,000 more before the fort falls,
-which probably will not be for months.
As a matter* of fact? when the Japan
ese get Port Arthur they won't get
much. They might have been doing
greater work with their men elsewKere
Thus General Stoessel, with 16,000
men, has worked wonders In decimat
ing the Japanese ranks."
So Epoke Reginald Glossop of Hull,
England, who* arrived in Chicago to
day, after having- been with the Jap
anese forces under General Nogi.
'â¢The only important fort thus far
taken by the Japanese is 203-Meter
Hill," he continued. "There are still
sixteen, which will require the loss of
many men to take, Liaotishan, the
higher Inner fort, is like the rock of
Gibraltar. It will be a long time be
fore the Japanese take this."

PERFECT CALM
AFTER STORM
Quiet and Orderly Session
of the Hungarian Parlia
ment Held in Budapest
RIOTS ARE CONDEMNED
Opposition Parties Fail to
Enlist Public Sympathy
in Their Demonstrations
BUDAPEST. Hungary. Dec. 14.â The
lower house of the Hungarian Parlia
ment opened this morning in perfect
calm. The royal rescript convoking the
Diet' was listened to attentively, and
the house thereafter adjourned without
the least attempt on the part of the
opposition to renew the. rioting of yes
terday. The orderliness oT~the proceed
ings was attributed to the absence of
President Perczel.
The opposition, under the leadership
of Count Apponyi and Francis Kossuth,
took possesion of the House as early as
6:30 o'clock this morning in consequence
of the rumor that the Government pro
posed a sitting at 7 o'clock. The Depu
ties took up a strong position on the
President's platform, prepared to repel
any attempt of the guards to dispossess
them. The latter, however, made, no
effort to enter the House, and on the
assurances of Count Andrassy that
President Perczel would not preside and
that the guards would not enter the
House, the platform was cleared.
Premier Tisza and the members of
his Cabinet entered, about a o'clock
and occupied the front bench, as all the
ministerial armchairs had been de
stroyed.
The members of the opposition par
ties have published a manifesto to the
nation in justification of their action
in removing the gendarmes from the
chamber and destroying the President's
chair, "from which the crime of No
vember 18 against the constitution wa3
committed." They declare they will do
their "duty in the same way again to
save the country and the constitution."
It is evident, however, that the op
position parties feel the weakness of
their cause and their failure to enlist
any great public support. The scene in
the chamber Tuesday is being almost
universally condemned.'
It is said that Count Andrassv acted
as mediator with Premier Tizsa and se
cured the compromise that enabled to
day's sitting of the chamber to be held,
namely, that President Perczel should
absent himself from the House on a
plea of illness and that gendarmes'
should not be admitted.
Another influence that induced the
tiuce is the knowledge that the crim
inal law provides a long sentence at
bard labor to any one preventing by
force the sitting of Parliament.

MILLIONAIRE
NOW DIRECTS
FRENCH ARMY
SOCIALIST. MILLIONAIRE AND
BROKER AT HEAD OF THE
FRENCH WAR OFFICE.
PARIS. Dec. 14.â Maurice Berteaux,
the Socialist, millionaire, stockbroker
and Deputy, who has just succeeded
General Andre as Minister of War, is
something of a noveltyln that capacity.
There have been Socialist Ministers be
fore, notably Millerand, Minister of
Commerce in the Waldeck-Rousseau
Cabinet, and Pelletan, Minister of Ma
rine in the. present Cabinet. Indeed,
Premier Combes himself, though flying
the Hag of the so-called Progressionist
Republicans, is a Socialist in convic
tions and in line of conduct. But there
has never before been a stockbroker
Minister in France, and very few civil
ians have been Ministers of War, the
only precedents in recent years being
Godfrey de Cavaigne and De Frey
cjnet.
Maurice Berteaux was born at Saint-
Maur-les-Fo'sses in 1S52, and has been
a stockbroker on the Paris Bourse since
the age of 27. His first political expe
rience came a.s. City Legislator in the
town of Chatou, and he was afterward
Mayor of the same place. In 1893 he
was elected a member of the Chamber
of. Deputies representing the Seine-et-
Oise Department,- in which Versailles
stands, and he has been "regularly re
elected ever' since.
TRADE BEFORE OFFICE.
Berteaux is among thejnost success
ful of Bourse men, and he clings so
much to his profession that he has
refused to retire from active business
even to become Minister. Some opposi
tion to this was raised in the Cabinet,
and he declared that he would refuse
the appointment, but would not resign
his seat at the Bourse. Investigation
proved that, his case being unprece
dented, there was nothing unconstitu
tional in his retaining his business con
nections and, therefore, he was al
lowed tb do as he pleased.
As all young Frenchmen must per
form their army service without ex
emption, Berteaux will find numerous
sons of his best clients and sometimes
clients themselves among the soldiers
serving under him, and his position will
not be an enviable one when he is x com
pelled to administer punishment tc
them for questions of discipline.
While essentially a civilian arid a
financier. Berteaux is not lacking in
knowledge of army matters. He has
served his three years in the ranks
and is a captain of Reserves. For sev
eral years he has been secretary of the
Budget Commission for {he army, and
he has given proof of exceptional tech
nical ability. He was among the ad
vocates of the two-year army service
law, instead of three years, as at pres
ent, and his oration on this subject was
largely responsible for the passing of
the bill before the Chamber. This bill
has now been passed by the Senate
also, and' having been returned to the
Chamber for definite ratification,
Berteaux hopes to have the privilege of
being the first to apply It.
PLAN'S FOR REFORMS.
Among other reforms which he has in
view for the army are measures to
check the spread of tuberculosis and a
new method of recruiting officers, so
that those may hereafter be called from
all ranks of 'the population. The great
est present trouble in. this last connec
tion comes from the fact that French
officers are so poorly paid that the
armv doesn't offer a career sufficient in
Itself. A small, proportion of officers
are members ? of the nobility who want
a military career to carry on the pres
tige of their name, but fully nine
tenths are the sons of grocers, wine
dealers or others who have made
money without attaining social posi
tion, and see their best chance for a
social opening by entering the army.
Apart >from army matters Berteaux's
political programme is Socialistic in the
extreme, save for the fact that he does
not advocate, the confiscation of pri
vate fortunes for the public good. He
wants a new law by which railroad
employes and other workers shall re
ceive a greater share of all profits; he
wants an income tax; he wants to
break absolutely and irrevocably all
link between the French state *nd the
Vatican, and he clamors for a thorough
revision of the entire constitution en
liberal lines. .

PRINCE TO SEEK
AMERICAN WIFE
Swedish Press Hopes That
the Future King Will
Woo Alice Eoosevelt
PRAISES HER VIRTUES
President of the United
States Not Regarded as
a "Private Foreign Man"
Special Diroatch to The Call,
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON, Dec. .14.â News has
reached Washington that the newspa
pers of Sweden are discussing the prob
ability of Prince Gustaf Adolph. Duke
of Scandia, and eldest son of the Crown
Prince, taking an American wife. The
Upsala Nija Tiding recently printed a
significant editorial declaring that the
heir apparent would make a popular
choice should he decide to seek Miss
Alice Roosevelt as his royal bride. The
editorial continued:
"President Roosevelt's daughter, is a
young woman that in intelligence and
personal attributes is fully the equal
of her remarkable father. The royal
person who succeeds in winning her
hand will bring home to his country a
bride that, in qualification of heart and
head; would in a peculiarly satisfac
tory manner fill the position of consort
of a ruling monarch."
The editorial declares there Is noth
ing to prevent such a marriage, as the
President is not a "private foreign
man," and concludes with these sig
nficant words:
"That King Oscar would give his
sanction, there can be no doubt."
The Upsala paper's editorial has been
reprinted and revamped In many other
publications, and the -proposition Is re
ceived with general satisfaction, al
though some editors doubt if Mi3s
Roosevelt would "care ~to become a
Queen," since American girls, they say,
have the reputation of being "so inde
pendent."

SHAW CONFERS
WITH MILLERS
1 WASHINGTON, Dec. 14â At the re
' quest of Secretary Shaw representa
i tives of a number of the leading flour
1 milling* interests of the country were at
i the Treasury Department to-day in
conference with the Secretary on the
subject of the measure now in prepara-
I tion to allow a drawback on exported
! flour made in part . from imported
i wheat. During the" conference the Sec
| retary questioned the millers present
> on several matters of detail in connec
tion wjth the milling of wheat, the con
' dition of the export trade arid the
.necessity for the action asked for. At
the conclusion of the conference Secre
! tary Shaw made the following state
'ment:
! The Importance of the question will be ap
, predated when it is known* that during Octo
' ber. 10O3, 1,800,000 barrels of American made
i flour were exported and in October, 1904. less
''than 800,000 barrels. In other words, the ex
portation of American-made flour has fallen off
during the present season mere than one-half.
If the European bakers that have been using
the American made flour changre, it would be
next to impossible to get the trade back and
it never can be got back until the American
farmer sells his wheat cheap enough to permit
the American miller to undersell. When the
expert of the Treasury Department, was at
Minneapolis* in November, the Shern>ld-K!ng
Milling Company sent thirty-nine cablegrams to
Europe offering "our at 5 cents per barrel be
low the cost of production as shown by the
book?. But two replies were obtained. One
of them read: "It is absolutely useless for
\ you to cable us on such a basis. and the
â  other: "Your prices are out of sight."'
i Two mills are now In process of construction
In London. Â«ach with a capacity of 4000 barrels
a day. Similar mills are bÂ«ing built at Bel
fast and other places* Canadian mills regu
larly sell flour for export on the New York
City market and It ia then sent through Ihe
United States In bond from New York. To-day
the price of American wheat is about 1G cents
: cbove that of Canada. â¢â  - -

j WASHINGTON. Dec. 14. â Judge
William W: Morrow of the United
â¢States Circuit Court of San Francisco

-at the White House about the matters

CONSTANTINOPLE. Dec. 14.â In
consequence of the American and
British representations the Porte has
renewed the instructions to the prin

to sell Bibles in towns and villages.
The Porte, however, persists in ob
jecting to colporteurs traversing the
disturbed rural districts of European
Turkey, on the pretext that their
safety cannot be guaranteed, and also
to the sale of Bibles in the Anatolian
provmces, because of the alleged fear
that'the colporteurs may distribute
seditious literature to the Armenians.

FORTUNE LEFT
IRISH PEASANT
Joseph O'Hare of Donough
inore Made Rich by Death
of His Sister in America
TO CONTINUE FARMING
Humble Tenant Prepares to
Buy His Farm and Live
as Befits Man of Wealth
Special Dlspctcb to ThÂ« CalL
DUBLIN, Dec 14.â The arrival of the
fortune of $250,000 left by Margaret
OHare, the adopted daughter of
Thatcher Magoun of Medford, near
Boston, is being awaited anxiously by
several Irish landlords- Simultaneous
ly with the passing of the Irish land
act, which enables the Irish peasantry
to buy out their landlords, the news
reached the little town of Newry, in the
northeast of Ireland, that Margaret
OHare (or Maggie O'Hare. as she was
called in ther girlhood days) had died
In Boston and had left the hulk of her
fortune to a brother and sister who
live In an obscure little village called
Donoughmore, about four miles from
Newry. â¢
This brother. Joseph O'Hare, had al
ready entered into negotiations with
his landlord to bur his small farm of
thirty acres with the aid of money pro
vided by the Government under the
land act, but when the news arrived
that there was a prospect of his suc
ceeding to a nice little fortune of some
thing like $175,000 he hesitated, and sub
sequently declined the assistance of the
English exchequer.
GROWS IX IMPORTANCE!
"I'll have my own money," eaid he to
fcimself. "in a month or two, and I don't
see why I should be under an obliga
tion to the Government."
The countryside flocked to Joseph
OWare's humble cottage to congratu
late him on his good fortune, while
many who*, knew "Maggie" as a child
in the famine days of 1847, when she
Â«et sail for America, dropped a tear at
the news of her death.
Joseph O'Hare has returned from
Boston, where he was invited to es
tablish his claim, and is already recog
nized as one of the wealthiest men
coming into the market town of Newry.
The landlord and his agent, who rarely
eaw him exceut on occasions when his
rent was due, are now constant visitors
at his cottage and fraternize with him
Â£-â¢= If he were a millionaire freshly im
ported. *
PLANS FX3R THE FUTURE.
Although the money has not reached
Donoughmore yet, all sorts of sugges
tions are being forced on O'Hare with
regard to the disposal and investment
of his suddenly acquired wealth. Some
say that a store in the town of Xewry
â¢would yield good results; others, active
in the Irish industrial revival, say that
he ought to establish a factory in the
village, which would give employment
to a number of young women who will
otherwise be forced to emigrate to
America or to England.
Joseph O'Hare is. however, wedded to
farming, - and â  Thatcbgr^-Jrfagoun's
money is to go into the land. ; He Is an
old man, he says, and In the; natural
course of events he will notf have much
time left to bother about â  new-fangled
ideas. He has already mafle^hla will,
leaving bis fortune to a nuniber of sons
and daughters.
The O'Hare cart has been discarded
and the more fashionable jaunting car
has taken its place. The neighbors have
dropped familiarities, and "Old Joe"
that was is now "Mr. O'Hare." The
daughters wear the latest fashions in
dress and millinery.

LONDON GOSSIP
OF THE AUTHORS
"Pigs in Clover" Written
as Result of Accident
to Mrs. Frankau's Husband
ROSEBERY'S BOOK INDEX
Former Premier Suggests
an Open Season for
the Persistent Borrowers
Special Dispatch to The Call
LONDON, Dec 14.â Arthur Ffankau's
recent death recalls the fact that it
was largely through an accident which
befell him several years ago that his
wife, Mrs. Julia Frankau. came to em
bark in authorship. Mrs. Frankau,
who signs herself "Frank Danby," is,
of course, the author of -'Pigs in Clov
er," the rather daring novel which
made such a stir on both sides of the
Atlantic, somewhat more than a year
ago, and the new romance "Baccarat,"
which has just been published here and
In the United States.
In his early married life Frankau,
who was a cigar manufacturer, did a
good deal of horseback riding and one
day he was thrown and injured one
leg so badly that he was confined to his
bed for many weeks. , Mrs. Frankau
was at his bedside almost constantly,
and it was not long before the idea
struck her of distracting her mind
during these vigils by trying to write
a book. She had had the strongest
possible encouragement to make such
an experiment â from no less a person
than George Moore, whom her husband
had introduced to her. It happened at
one time that the author of "Esther
Waters" needed, for d, novel he was
writing, a letter written by a woman
under certain circumstances, and being
struck by Mrs. Frankau's strong per
sonality, Moore asked her if she would
write such a letter for him. She did
bo and Moore was so impressed with
the result that he strongly advised Her
to write a novel.
Following the advice beside her hus
band's bedside, Mrs. Frankau found
that ideas came and put themselves
Into words In a truly marvelous fash
ion. One evening she read'to her hus
band what she had composed thus far,
and he was so surprised and Interested
that thereafter she read every even
ing what she had written during the
day and when the book, which was
called "Dr. Phillips," was finished, both
authoress and critic believed there was
rather more than "something" in it.
The novtl was published, and, though
it made no great stir. Mrs. Frankau
was encouraged to try again. Later shu
w rote "A Babe in Bohemia" and "The
Copper Crash," but it was not until
after the publication of "Pigs iu
Clover" that she tasted the sweets of
complete success.
jMrs. Frankau Is a sister of "Owen
Hall," the librettist, and of Mrs. Aria,
perhaps the ablest woman editor in
this country.
ECCENTRIC FITZGERALD.
Oay irresponsibility is not a quality !
which lovers of "Omar Khayyam" have j
associated with its best translator, Ed- {
ward Fitzgerald, but he must have had j
a large streak of it, judging from" the }
stories '-which his old friend, Sir Cuth-'f
bert Quilter. told at a dinner the other I
evening. Sir Cuthbert declared that j
he had begun his yachting career with !
a urelve-ton schponer purchased ; Of ?
Fitzgerald. The poet named this-craftj
"The Emetic." and provisioned herJ
originally with apples, herrings and a]
tottle of gin. Sir Cuthbert added that i
it was told of Fitzgerald that one day j
he was on board the "Emetic" with his
upual tall hat and frock coat reading '
the Times, when the boat gave a lurch ]
and the translator of "Omar" went to :
the bottom. It was a most remarkable j
factâ and not a bit of Eastern imag- |
inationâ that when Fitzgerald came up j
again he had his pipe in his mouth, his ;
tall hat upon his head and the Times
in his hand. It' was further stated that i
when he got back on board his little !
craft he calmly finished reading th<i !
article that was previously engaging |
his attention.
There are few more enthusiastic
bookmen in Great Britain than Lord
Rosebery, and the Earl was at his
happiest the other day when he open
ed the new Carnegie library at West
Calder. Among other things he -made
a witty reference to the "index which
existed In the Roman Catholic churchâ
a list of books which, in the opinion
of the church, it was not well for peo
ple to read," and then said that he
wanted several indexes. He did not
want one for objectionable books, for
so great was the force of human curi
osity that he was afraid those were the
first books that a great many ill-con
fctituted minds would seek.
He wanted, in the first place, an In
dex free from all private influence of
authors and publishers, to tell tht?ru
what were the books they ought to
read and the books they ought- to buy,
which were not by any means tb_e same
thing. The amateur adviser as to what
and what not to read he had found an
intolerable person. Such advice had
broken up many friendships. The- man
who was recommended to read a novel
and after getting a hundred pages into
it found it impossible to go on, and yet
after having read so much found it un
profitable to lay it down, swore an eter
nal enmity against the man who recom
mended to him that book.
BORROWERS OF BOOKS.
No limitation of means could in these
days excuse anybody from not buying
books, but he distinguished between
books to be read and books to be
bought. They read in order to see
whether the book was worth buying.
He found two further classes of booksâ
the books that they borrowed from
friends and returned, and the books
they borrowed and did not return. The
non-returning of books had ended more
friendships and terminated more affec
tions than any -other cause of which
he was cognizant. The man who bor
rowed one volume from a set and never
returned it was a man who should be
treated like vermin, trapped or shot at
Bight, or any other of the 'punishments
which might be extended to this least
and vileat of mankind.
His ideal index would be that which
told them the best book to read on any
subject that they might ask for, but his
fear was that they would get nobody to
frame any such index, because his life
would not be safe. Authors and pub
lishers who do not find their names and
their books on the list would seek his
life, and be might have to sit, like the
newspaper editor in the Western States
of America,, with a couple of revolvers
in his drawer ready to shoot at sight
the first complaining person that should
appear.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.â The Sen
ate, which binder the constitution is
made the trial court In impeachment
cases, to-day received official notice
of. the determination of the House of
Representatives to present impeach
ment charges again Charles Swayne,
Judge in the northern district of Flori

Senate's attentionrby a House commit
tee and.rthe Senate appointed a com
mittee c6hsisting of Platt ot Connecti

Bacon and Pettus to prepare the details
of the proposed â¢: trial. ..: : â 
The Senate considered the Philippine

Culberscn of;J;Texa*s gave notice that
he would offer several^ amendments -to
the Philippine ' bfll, among them /one
striking out tf^e 'entire section guar
anteeing interest on tne '.bonds of* the
proposed system of. railroads. He did
not doubt, he said, that' railroads were
essential to. the development of the
islands and that 'their., construction
would improve the military situation
there as well 'as'tenc! to The establish
ment of an orderly and stable govern
ment, but he contended that the rate
of 5 per cent proposed ; to be allowed
was not only excessive'" but an unnec
essary burden on a people already im
poverished by war. ' â¢ ' â¢
Newlands said that under the terms
of the bill the Philippine Government
had no indemnity for interest paid on
the proposed Government bonds. He
believed the Government would have
to pay them, and thought that the
United States could reduce the interest
from 5 to 2 per cent by guaranteeing
the bonds, inasmuch as this Govern
ment was morally responsible . in any
event,- and he believed it- should stand
good for â¢ them from the beginning. â¢
The following bills were -passed: Au
thorizing the erection of additional
buildinps at the new Dungeness light
house in the State ; of Washington;
making additional appropriation for
the Battery Point post light, Washing

OATHS TAKEN
BY MORMONS
Promise Made to Ask That
Blood of Joseph Smith Be
Areriged Upon the Nation
CANNON-HAMLIN UNION
Apostle Confessed on Death
Bed That He Had Married
Woman on the High Seas
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.â Testimony
relating to the alleged polygamous
marriage of the late Apostle Abram
Cannon and Lillian Hamlin, and con
cerning the obligations taken by per
sons who passed through the Mormon
Endowment House was offered to-day
in the investigation of the protests
against Senator Reed Smoot before the
Senate Committee on Privileges and
P^lectioris.
Mrs. Fred Ellis of Salt Lake' City, a
daughter of Angus Cannon, who maiy
ned her cousin. Abram Cannon, when
she was 19 years of age, testified that
she was Abram Cannon's first plural
wife, and that her husband married
Lillian Hamlin on June 18, 1896. He
was at that 'time one of the 'twelve
apostles. Cannon, according to the wit
ness, then had three wives, and he told
her he intended to marry Lillian Ham
lin. He told her that Miss Hamlin had
been engaged to his brother David, who
had died, and she therefore wanted to
marry Abram. Mrs. Ellis detailed a
conversation she had with her husband,
In which ehe told him she did not think
he could marry Lillian Hamlin. Can
non said he could marry outside the
Stateâ that he would marry her for
time and she would be David's wife for
eternity.
"I told him that if he did marry Lil
lian," said the witness, "I could not live
with him- when the church or the law
would not recognize his marriage*"
Mrs. Ellis told of the departure of
Cannon and Miss Hamlin, accompanied
by President Smith, who is said to have
performed the marriage ceremony on
the high seasV and of their return. They
returned about July 6, 1S96. Cannon
was ill and died about three weeks
later.
"He confessed on his deathbed that
he had married Miss Hamlin," said
Mrs.' Ellis, "and he said: 'I have never
had a well day since.' I think it killed
him," the witness added, sobbingly. ,
James H. Wallis , Sr., who divulged
the Endowment House oaths, was're
called. This oath, he now said, con
tains nothing concerning vengeance
upon "inhabitants of the earth," but Is
a pledge' to avenge the blood of the
slain prophets upon "the nations of the
earth."
August Lundstrum of Salt Lake City
was sworn. He testified that he went
through the temples in Salt Lake and
Logan. He had heard the
obligations taken six times, he said,
each ceremony consuming from six to
eight hours, according to the size of
the crowd. He said baths of sacrifice
and of 'retribution were administered.
' The "whole proceeding was a series of
obligations, said the witness," but â¢' he
could not remember iaU^of them:. The
first in order, he said; was the law of
sacrifice, which bound each person 'to
give his entire means and' talents to
the upbuilding of : the. Mormon church.
The next obligation,- was 1 that of retri
bution, in which each person promised
to "ask God to avenge the blood of Jo
seph Smith upon this nation" and to
teach "our children and our children's
children to do the same to the end of
the earth." .
The next obligation was that of chas
tity.

VOTES THROWN
OUT BY COURT
Action of Denver Tribunal
May Give Republicans the
Control of Legislature
RESULT OF BIG FRAUDS
Precedent Established by
Which Thousands of the
Ballots May Not Figure
DENVER, Dec. 14.â By deciding to
day to throw out. the, vote of .Precinct
Seven, Ward Eight, of ,this city, In con
sequence of frauds committed, there at
the late election, the Supreme Court es
tablished a precedent that may be ap
plied to. many other precincts in which,
it Is alleged, the court's Injunction or
der was violated, . and thereby vitally
affect tho results of the election. Should
similar action be taken in other cases
to the extent demanded by the Repub
licans' lawyers, it will result in the
election of the entire Republican legis
lative ticket in this county and give
the Republicans . control " of .both
branches of the Legislature. On the
fate of the returns, the Republicans
have a majority in the House and the
Democrats a majority in the Senate. .
Another result of the exclusion of a
few precincts would be to put the Re
publicans In possession of all the city
and county offices except the Mayor
alty, should the Supreme Court decide
that the spring election was not legal
and that these offices were 'to be filled
at the November election. The Demo
cratic majorities ran from 700 to 2000.
Shoula the entire vote of eight city
wards over which the Supreme Court
assumed jurisdiction be disregarded,
Alva Adams, the Democratic candidate
for Governor, would lose 18,845 votes
and Governor James H. Peabody 8541, a
net loss of 10,304 for Adams, but this
alone would not result in his defeat, as
his majority In the State is something
over 11,000.
In announcing the decision to exclude
the returns of Precinct Eight, Ward
Seven, Chief Justice Gabbert said:
"Frauds cannot be fully prevented un
less the court assuming jurisdiction to
prevent' them has the power to undo
them in all cases where they are com
mitted in violation of 'its orders. A
court of equity has the inherent power
to effectuate its' orders, and the motion
will, therefore, be sustained."
It is announced that 120 more war
rants have been issued by the Supreme
Court c-n application of the Republicans
for the arrest of persons alleged to
have been implicated in the election
frauds.
PUEBLO, Colo., Dec. 14.â An indict
ment in four counts was returned by

SAN JOSE. Dec 14.â C. R. Williams,
who was recently declared by the Su
preme Court to be the duly elected Re
corder of Santa Clara County, made a
demand to-day on County Recorder
Treanor for the office. Treanor was
given a certificate of election by the
Board of Supervisors, but William* be
gan a contest and received a favorable
decision in all the courts. The remit
litur from the Supreme Court arrived
Tuesday, and at noon to-day Williams
and his attorney went to the Hail of
Records and made demand on Treanor
for the surrender of the office. Treanor
referred Williams to his attorney. A
conference between counsel followed,
and Attorney Campbell, who represents
Treanor. stated an answer would be
piven at 11 o'clock to-morrow morninc
ee to whether Treanor would surrender
the office.
Attorney Campbell began suit in the
Superior Court this afternoon to re
strain Williams from taking the office,

action is necessary to secure possession
cf the effice.
Treanor had a majority of several
hundred, but by throwing out ballots
that were stamped "no nomination"

ADVCTTLSE>lEyTS.
THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few PeoÂ£:e Know How Useful It Is In
Pres*r\1ng Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal Is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant end purlner in nature,
but few realize its valu* when taken
Into the human system for the same
cleansing purpose. r-~# .
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; It Is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
and Impurities always present
In the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinkingr or after eating on-
ions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Im-
proves the complexion; It whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
end eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the Etomach and bowels; It
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or ar.other. but probably the
"best charcoal and the most for the
money is in Etnart'a Charcoal Lozen-
ges; they are composed of the finest
powdered Willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form,
or rather in the form of larg*. pleas-
ant tasting 3ozÂ»Â»nges, the charcoal be-
ing mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
Boon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use. but. on the â¢ contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking 1 of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I advise
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all pa-
tients Buffering from gas in stomach
and bowels and to clear the complex-
Ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores and although in some
fense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than In
any of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

Special Prosecutor in Land
Fraud Cases Not Ready to
Press Conspiracy Charge
GRAND JURY SUMMONED
New .Matters Will Be Taken
Before Inquisitorial Body
by Government Attorneys
PORTLAND. Or., Dee. 14.â On mo
tion to-day of Special Assistant United
Ftates Attorney General Francis 'J.
Heney. all the land fraud cases now
pending in the United States Circuit
Court for the District of Oregon were
ordered over for the term. The wit
nesses lummoned to appear were ex
cused for the term, and speculation
was rife as to the cause of this unex
pected action on the part of the Gov
ernment.
After the motion for a continuance
was allowed and the order entered
United States District Attorney John
H. Hall asked- the court that the Fed
eral Grand Jury, which was given a
recess early in November, be ordered
to reconvene next Monday.
Attorney Heney- this afternoon fcave
out the following statement of reasons
for a continuance of the land fraud
cases: "It is necessary for me to be in
San Francisco on important private
business on January 3, and to be in
"Washington on the Hyde-Dimond land
fraud case during the second week In
January, and as it appeared that the
conspiracy case, upon the trial of
which we were about to commence,
would consume as much time as the
preceding one, and would thereby pre
vent me from keeping my engage
ments, and as I desired to present some
important matters to the Grand Jury
before leavlrg here, I Fecured_the con
sent of the attorneys for the defend
ants to continue the pending cases for
th* term in consideration of the Gov
ernment's making some slight conces
sions in relation to the defendants'
bonds in the cases which have not yet
been tried.
"For obvious reasons It would not
bt: proper for me to give any Intimation
as to what the matters are wfiich I
expect to present to the Grand Jury."

TAKE CHINESE
INTO CUSTODY
Immigration Inspectors Cap
ture Six Asiatics Who Had
Crossed the Mexican Line
UNABLE TO GIVE NAMES
Prisoners Will Be Ordered
. Deported as They Are Not
Legally in This' Country
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 14.â Six more Chi
nese were brought to the County" Jail
this â¢ afternoon accused of being in
the United States unlawfully. They
were captured by United States immi
gration inspectors late Monday night
while they were in the vicinity of Otay.
That the Chinese had traveled far
was evident by their condition. All
were tired out when captured. They are
thought. to belong to a large party of
Chinese which have been making Ense
nada their quarters while waiting for
a favorable opportunity to cross the
line without detection.
None of those captured were able to
give their names. They will ' probably
be arraigned before United States Com
missioner Knoles to-morrow, and as
none of them have certificates they will
probably be ordered deported. With the
arrival of the six to-day there are now
twelve Chinese in the County Jail who
have either been ordered deported or
who are awaiting a hearing.
Dick TiD, another Chinese caught
near the boundary some time ago, has
been ordered deported. He had in his
possession a list of twenty other Chi
nese who started with him for this con
tinent and who had paid a company in
China money to get them into the
United States. A map was found In his
pocket giving directions for the jour
ney from Ensenada to Tia Juana,
thence by a devious route to. this city.
MAKES FIXE COLLECTION i-i
OF PICTURES OF OLD SHIPS
Secretary Scott of the Chamber of
Commerce Exhibits Types of !
Famous Craft. V
Secretary Eben Scott has placed on
the walla of the new assembly-room
of the Chamber of Commerce. In the
Merchants' Exchange building, the
most interesting collection of marine
pictures that has, ever been seen in
this city. This consists of representa
tions of great sailing vessels of four
types and Indicative of four periods
of maritime history when "wind jam
mers" were the monarchs of the seas.
The first of the vessels represented is
the Roscius. one of the old "Baltimore
clippers" that were in use early in
the nineteeth century. This was do
nated to the Chamber of Commerce
by the estate of Oliver Eldrldge.
The second la an old "Black Ball
liner," such as carried the business
of the Atlantic Ocean before the ad
vent of ocean steamships and were
used even after the steamships had
been adopted. This was also given to
the chamber by the Oliver Eldridge
estate. The third ship pictured is the
Flying Cloud, one of thVmost famous
of, the swift craft that brought the
gold seekers to California in the '50*8.
The Flying Cloud had the clipper ship
record between New York and San
Francisco. Once the Flying Cloud
made a run of 13.610 miles in eighty
nine days. Again the trip was com
pleted In eighty-nine â¢ days and nine
teen hours. On one of these trips the
handsome clipper sailed 375 miles in
twenty-four hours. W. C. Gibbs gave
this to the chamber.
The fourth of the interesting series
was given by Captain W. L. Merry,
now United States Minister to Central
American republics. It represents
the "half clipper" Tornado, which had
good speed, but was more particularly
designed to have carrying capacity
and to be stanch. Since the clipper
ship days have departed and the car
rying trade of the world is destined to
be conducted with steam as a motor
the pictures have great historical
value. They are given a favored po
sition where the light falls upon them
and where they will be readily seen
by Californians as they sit in council
in the assembly-room. - "
ASIATIC 3IONROE DOCTIUXE
JAPAX'S LONGING HOPE
Rev. W. 'N. Brewster. Noted Mission
ary, Speaks of Political Condi
tions In Far East.
The probability of an Oriental com
pact which -will create and maintain
an Asiatic Monroe doctrine was one
of .the many interesting things heard
by an audience last night at Grace
Methodist Episcopal Church, Twenty
first and Capp streets, by the Rev W.
N. Brewster of Hing Hua, China. "
The Rev. Mr. Brewster has been
living, in China as a missionary for
fifteen years, and after a year's so
journ in his. native land leaves once
more on Saturday for the Far East to
renew his; work. In giving some as
pects of the political, .industrial and
religious conditions in .the Far East
he said that Japan is endeavoring to
form an alliance lookingto the inde
pendence of the Asiatic powers, gov
erned by a principle similar to the
Monroe doctrine.
â When traveling to the United States
he learned that an Embassador was
then on hl3 way from Persia to Toklo
presumably in: the interest of creating
a better understanding between Persia
and Japan. The. Japanese 'commis
sioner to the 'St. Louis World's Fair
told the r Rev. ! Mr. Brewster that he
had not the slightest hesitation -In
saying that Japan looked toward such
an alliance. . . , . ;

WHEELER CALLS
SPADE A SPADE
President of the University
Says the Institution Has
Been Only a Big School
Berkeley Office, San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Dec 14.
Plain words are used by President
Wheeler in discussing for a special
edition of the college daily paper the
"University's Relations With Other
American Colleges." Without an at
iempt to gloss over matters, or pre
lerve any illusions indulged by Califor
aians. President Wheeler declares that
the University of California has been
tn reality simply a big school or col
lege. The president states that "it3
reorganization on the way to a real
university is in progress."
President Wheeler saye:
The university has b-en in reality dimply a
*ig school or college. Us reorganization on
the way to a rr-al university is in progreeK.
fhe mass of the undergraduates still think
evidently of the place a* a school and not a*
a university, but tlve change will come and
nothing can prevent it. At present, ss com
pared with other universities. It is most back
wart in Its buildings and equipment. The
bulidlnr* are those of a very small college.
They were built for a college of four or five
hundred. Th-y are. therefore, ludicrously in
adequate for a unHerslty of three thousand. \
The fact that there exists no lecture room I
capable of accommodating a class of three
tundred is a very significant Illustration.
If the question la asked, "What relative
position does the 1'nlversity of California hold
among the universities of the country?" It
would be said that It stands among the first
8vÂ« or six in numbers; Â«mong the first seven
or eight tn the character und strength of its
teaching force; emong the first fifteen in it*
financial resource*; among the first thirty in
Its build ings and equipment.
The University of California has in past
year* been very severely Isolated from thÂ«
ttlxr American institutions. Ttie movement
to and fro between the Eastern universities â 
â¢Jid the L'nivtrslty of California has been very '
limited Men have sWdoni been called from
California to take places in Eastern, universi

brought from the Ka*t to the West, the large
majority of the instructor* an3 rrofe*sors in
the university belns graduates thereof.
It is on this account that the Host has
known very little r.bout the University of
California. In recent yi-ars movements have
been on foot which have fnded to change
thl*. The establishment of a neries of publi
cations, such as publications in geology, bot
any, pathology, physiology, etc.. through which
the profesrora of the university are encouraged
to Â«p*Â»k their brÂ« thought to the scientific
Â»orld. hai-e ptxhaps done more than anything;
else to attract tUi* attention.
It i* also Important that representatives of
the utilverMty have in increasing measure lx>en
found at the i;at.hTings of scientific men. his
torians, etc.. in the Hart. It was, for tn
ttance. tetnarked by on* of the professors in
the University cf Chicago at the recent
World's Consress at St. - lxm!s* that the con
gresa seemed really lo be a California con
gress. Tnt v University of California was better
represented, considering its size, than any
other.
The summer session has broupht prominent
tnen from otUer universities to the I'niv-rslty
â¢of California and thfy have conceived a strong
attachment Tor it. Wherever they have gone
they have carried the good name of the uni
versity. In recent years, alto, more men of
established prominence In thÂ« general academic
world hax-o been brought to Berkeley for per
manent connection. This has had a very de
cided Influence tn attracting attention to the
university. . "VV~

SILENT PLACES
DEPICTED BY
PEN AND BRUSH
By Zoe Green Radcllffe.
OAKLAND. Dec. 14. â When next the Oalr
land Club meets it will have entered upon a
new year, for the last assembly of this month
took place to-day. The current literature and
forestry sections united in planning the day's,
programme, and succeeded in making the
afternoon an unusually interesting cae.
The "Silent Places," by Edward S.tewart
â VViiite. waa reviewed by Mrs. Julia B. Foster,
heibelf a writer as well as critic, and then
Mrs. Mary Tracy Mott gave a ehort personal
sketch of Mr. White.
Mrs. J. G. Lemmon sooke briefly but enter
tainingly of California's crowning glory â the
redwoods â telling her auditors how to distin
guish between the tall but slender coast trees
and the riants of the interior.
At the conclusion of the programme the
"Christmas tree with one present" was robbed
of it* fruit â s book by Marion Crawford,
"Whosoever Shall Offend" â and awarded by
lot to Mrs. E. C. Burrell of Berkeley.
The meeting waa largely attended to-day,
and. while enjoying eome very delicious coffee
and sandwiches the guests had the privilege
of vlewins: a fine display of water colors by
Mr*. M. Fiincher Petlis.
\ery appropriately Mrs. Pettis' were studies
cf the giant sequoias referred to by Mrs. Lem
nion. Mrs. Pettia exhibited two dozen or more
paintings, several noteworthy pieces being in
cluiled in the collection. The artist has faith
fully depicted the "silent place*" of the Big
Barln. its slant redwoods. Its feathery ferns
and rlctous undergrowth. HÂ»re she has a bit
of rnaaway. uatthed with winllght that falls
through the overhanging, leaf-laden branches;
there a cnarlcd and knotted forest kinÂ«? that
stands out royally against a backirround of
tender green.
Betng all studies of the same district, there
was necessarily a sameness in to-day's ex
hlUt but there was in each eketch an indi
viduality, a characteristic touch that at once
s.M.arated it from its fellows. The feminine
lorajor detail wa* evident at times, but much

THE SAN FRANCISCQ CALL^-THURSDAY. DECEMBER 15. 1904.
OAKLAND. Dec. 14.â A general
evangelistic movement has been start
ed by all of the Protestant churches of
Oakland, and at a meeting to-day the
details were arranged. AH ; of the
evangelical churches of the city are
interested, from north to south and
east to west of the city, and all of the
pastors and most of the lady members
are actively at work.
The organization of a general com
mittee was completed this afternoon.
This committee, representing all de
nominations, is composed of both lay
and ministerial delegates, will have
charge of the general campaign, and
will delegate district work to differ
ent churches and individuals. The
chairman is Rev. E. E. Baker of the
First Presbyterian Church, and the
Rev. E. R. Dille of the First Methodist
Church is the vice chairman. The sec
retary and treasurer are laymen, the
former being S. P, Meads and the
latter S. M. Dodge, both prominent
business men of Oakland. Earl S.
Bingham, one of the most popular and
hardest- Â©f workers connected with the
First .Presbyterian Church, has been
Placed at the head of the publicity
committee with the following' as his
assistants: Rev. I. N. Halliday, Rev.
H. B. Mowbry. There will be a special
music committee with Dr. O. S. Dean
as chairman and assistants in the per
sons of W. B. Raglin, H. W. Keifer,
Dr. Ray E. Gilson and O. M. Vesper.
The. general plan was outlined to-day
and is something new in religious work
on this coast. The preliminary meet
ings will begin after the new year.
From January 2 to January 7 there
will be a week of prayer in all of the
churches of Oakland, with an ex
change of ministers each evening. The
details of these meetings will be ar
ranged by the general committee later,
but there will be a new minister in
charge of each meeting in each church
during this week. .
In February there will be a reries
of cottage meetings. These meetings
will be held on each Monday evening
in February in, private houses. There
will be one hundred of these meetings
every Monday night, presided over by
both ministers and laymen, making
four hundred meetings in private
houses during the month. In addition
special prayer meetings will be held
in all of the churches during the month.
There will be a general exchange of
pulpits in all of the churches on the
last Sunday In February, the general
committee to announce the ministerial
assignments later. â â  â  . â â 
The month of March will be the
climax of the campaign. The city of
Oakland will be divided into four dis
tricts, and union prayer meetings will
be held in each during the first week of
the month. The pastors of the differ
ent churches in each district will con
duct these meetings.
A party of evangelists will arrive in
Oakland on March 5, and upon that
date daily meetings will occur at dif
ferent churches continuing until March
19. " i
This movement has been under way
for about a year. It was begun when
Rev. J. Wilbur Chapman' came to Oak
land about a year ago. The local
churches entered heartily into the
movement and for the last twelve
months there have been many meetings
that culminated In the general plan
that was announced to-day. Mr.
Chapman will conduct some of the
daily services during March, the pre
liminaries being in the hands of the
local workers. A perfect, spirit 1 of
harmony prevails, and the campaign
will be the greatest and most general
that Oakland has ever seen.

INVENTS MACHINE TO SOLVE
PROBLEMS OF LOGIC
Will Give Rest to Fagged Brains
Professor Rieber Believes He Has an
Apparatus That Can Reason.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
. 2148 Center Street, Dec. 14.
Logical problems worked out by ma
chinery is the achievement now being
sought by Dr. Charles H. Rieber, as
sistant professor of lopic at the Uni
versity of California, and when his ex
periments are finally concluded Dr.
Rieber Is confident that he will have
perfected a unique machine, capable
of answering abstruse and difficult
questions with such accuracy and
speed as rarely are displayed by the
human mind in its workings upon such
lines. .
Dr. Rieber is loth at this time to dis
cuss his invention, desiring to refrain
from -explanation or announcement un
til all the details of his project have
been given attention. It is known,
however, that his machine is intende-1
to so operate as to eliminate all errors
in the consideration of syllogistic prop
ositions and show instantly Avhat con
clusions may . be expected to follow
from a given premise. Questions rep
resented by certain set formulae used
in logic are to be propounded to the
machine, which will then, with uner
ring Intelligence, supply the only an
swers possible lo give in accord with
logic.
The English scientist W. S. Jevons
has a machine in use working on some-
POLICE HALED
BEFORE COURT
Affidavits Charging Pilfer
ers in Uniform With Bur
glary Are Made by Chief
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
101 C Broadway, Dec. 14.
Chief of Police Hodgkins to-day
swore to affidavits charging former
Sergeant of Police C. E. Clark and Pa
trolmen J. F. Stahl, C. W. Hamerton
and Lee E. Andrews with burglary,.
Subpenas were issued directing the ac
cused men to appear on Friday before
Police Judge Mortimer Smith,, when
hearing will be held to decide .whether
there Is sufficient evidence to" warrant
arrest and prosecution. ; .;/.
Police : and 1/ citizen^ -witnesses have
also, been subpenaed., 1'. .";, ', â  â .â  â¢
â i Prosecuting Attorney.^ Leach- said
that the complaints upon which the
warrants might ' issue could not be
sworn to on "information and belief,"
as were these affidavits. But the affi
davits could be taken as the bas's of
the hearing.
From the bench Judge Smith said:
It is true that complaints Issued on "infor
mation and belief are not sufficient, s.-.d war
rentB of arrest under such circumstances can
not be If hUt.-<i. But ' upon euch an application
as has been made by the Prosecuting Attorney
it Is the duty of the court to take depositions
and hear testimony.
This move in the case was made as
the result of the failure of any person
to swear, to direct charges of burglary
against, the four men. After the- Board
of Police and Fire Commissioners re
ferred the cases to Prosecuting Attor
ney Leach he drew complaints that lay
In his office unsigned. At the last meet
ing of the board President J. E. Mc-
Elroy notified Chief of Police Hodgkins
that the law gave power to swear to
such affidavits as were made to-day.
The only testimony at. hand
is based upon the forced con
fessions of the men. It has been
contended that methods were em
ployed to induco them to confess that
would bar their statements from use.
For that reason there has been hesita
tion on the part of the police in swear
ing, to . complaints.
Subpenas cannot reach Stahl. who
has gone to Portland. Or., nor Clark,
who departed on. a sailing vessel from
San Francisco several days ago as
second mate. Hamerton and Andrews
have been in Oakland, but the court
officials express a doubt whether either
of thÂ«Â»m will be within reach of sum
mons.
The Grand Jury, which was impan
eled to-day, was instructed by Superior
Judge S. P. Hall that It was within its
province to investigate the police scan
dal. In his remarks Judge Hall said:
It is your duty to take cognizance of matters
published in the press. Often persons have
not the inclination to swear to a complaint,
but you have the right to subpena witnesses,
and If you be'.leve that there is good cause for
action, it ii your duty to return | an indict
ment. It is here that tho efficacy, of a grand
Jury. lies.
The new Grand Jury is composed of
H. N. Gard. H. B. Belden. Daniel Mc-
Carthy. J. N. Green, Serrill Winsor,
D. R. Moulton. William Mann, Frank
Harrold. .Charles C. Volberg. Henry

what similar lines to those laid down
by Dr. Rieber. but it has been known
to make errors and is comparatively
crude and unsatisfactory. Dr. Rieber
asserts that he is working on his ma
chine with an idea of correcting the
mistakes "made by the Englishman's
apparatus.
Plausible arguments are used by. Dr.
Rieber to prove that a logical machine
may succeed on the same lines as the
now familiar adding machines. In logic
there are certain rigid rules to be fol
lowed, just as in mathematics or , the
science of quantities. The logical ma
chine upon which Dr. Rieber is at
work follows out the principles used
in the adding machine, applying them
to the subject of a qualitative reason-
Ing. It will be more complicated, how
ever, than the adding machines. In
much the same way, however, that the
adding machine turns out the answer
"seven" when "four" and "three" are
pressed, the logical machine will turn
out all the possible combinations of
letters that can follow from a given
proposition. All combinations incon
sistent with the premises are eliminat
ed by the machine, and when a propo
sition is put to the abacus that. does
not follow out the rules of logic the
machine will refuse to work. When the
machine Is asked to consider disjunct
ive propositions its operation will of
necessity become more complex.
SAYS LAWYER
DECEIVED HER
Ignorance of Legal Matters
Pleaded by Girl as Excuse
for Annuling a Contract
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Brottdway, Dec. 14.
Having doeded away halt of her
birthright to Attorney Frederick Rus
sell for legal services rendered, Mrs.
Jennie de Soza is endeavoring to free
herself from the contract and the
hoarmg of her case is now before
Judge Melvin. SHe claims youth and
ignorance of the law. and ways of at
torneys as her excuse for signing a
contract which if upheld will give
Russell ' one-half of an $11,148 86 inher
itance, she ; to bear out of her half
all" of the expenses.
Mrs, de Soza to-day gave her age
as 19.' She is married to a man two
years her senior and upon the stand
told the following story:"
When my grandmother, Catherine Griffin of
Guemeville, died 1 was to get a quarter 'of
some money left me by my grandfather, James
Scobie. 1 had run away from my grandmothir
and was here in Oakland with my husband.
We had no money and I told Mr. Russell about
the estate that was coming to me and ask<nl
him if he could not help us. He looked into
the matter and tcld us that it would probably
mean a hard right to g?t the money, but that
if we would sign a contract he would see that
we were advanced enough ! money to get along
on. 1 agreed to his proposal. Since then I
have found that he has charged me too much.
There is no fight over the money. My grand
mother died a short time ago and there Is
about $45,000 to be divided among four of us.
He only nave us about $60. ;â¢'.
It was shown by Attorney Charles
Peery, for the plaintiff, that the first
contract signed by her was drawn 1 up
before she had become of legal age
and that Russell afterward got her to
sign a second one. Upon his side, Rus
sell contends that he defended them
in a charge of vagrancy and other dif
ficulties they got into here and ad
vanced them considerable more money
than they are willing to admit they
received.

A LACK OF WATER
Hearing of Xlehaus Bros.' Suit De

Been Greater Pressure.
OAKLAND, Dec. 14. â While the
flames were devouring a mill valued
at $164,000 the water would not run
six feet out of the end of the hose, was
the testimony introduced to-day in
the suit of the Niehaus Bros.' Com
pany of Berkeley against the Contra
Costa Water Company for this sum
t o reimburse them for their loss by
fire.
Guy Hyde Chick of Berkeley, for
merly the agent there for the water
company, took the stand on behalf of
the plaintiffs this afternoon and said
that there should have been a sev
enty-pound pressure on the pipes on
the night the flames destroyed the
mill.
Philip Slsterna, a member of the
volunteer fire department, said that
on the night in question the water
hardly ran out of. the end of the hose.
He was corroborated by George Pirie,
a resident of the neighborhood, and
one of the first to arrive at the fire
and who < helped unroll the hose. C.
W. Burgess, a resident of Eureka,
who happened, to be visiting close by,
also testified that the water would not

TRY TO WIND
UP WATERBURY
Berkeley Man's Daughters
Â»; Hold Key to Problem of
"Why Should He Marry?"
TAKE TIME BY FORELOCK
Pistol Is Brandished by
Girl When Pa Tells All
Hands of His Second Love
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, Dec. 14*
George A. Waterbury is prepared to
add his testimony to the literature con
tributed by the folk who have writ
ten that "the path of true love never
does run smooth." "Waterbury has
been locked out of his residence at
1639 Prince street, by his four daugh
ters, because he proposed to marry
again.
When Waterbury announced his plan
to the v four daughters two days ago,
they rose en masse and protested firm
ly and not with special care to make
the protestations gentle. "Waterbury,
however, believed that once the first
storm had been endured, a calm might
be expected to follow, and then he
would bring his second spouse to the
family roof tree, and all would be as
before. â  . â  . â  >..--â :
The daughters neglected to resume
their normal state of mind, and this
disarranged Waterbury's programe. It
was still farther disarranged when
he returned last night to the home on
Prince street, and , found the door to
the house barricaded. -
"Who the deuce has locked up my
house?" yelled Waterbury. as he fran
tically kicked and pounded on the high
priced timbers of the building.'
"We have, paw," cried the four maid
ens in the house, who thereupon ap
peared at an upper window, from
whence Miss May Waterbury brand
ished a revolver that Waterbury recog
nized as his own weapon, and not a
toy weapon, either.
"You go right away from here,"
cried daughter No. 1, the eldest, "and
don't come back to sleep or to eat
till you have given up the Idea - of
bringing another woman here to run
the house!".
Waterbury retreated, and slept at
a lodging house in Oakland. His
meals he got at a restaurant. To-day
he tried again to get into his home,
but without success. Appeal was then
made to Justice Edgar and Deputy
Marshal Pickett for assistance, and the
latter promised to see that the Gordian
knot in the Waterbury household was
cut, deeply enough, at least, to permit
of the entrance of Mr."* Waterbury in
to the rooms where his lares and pen
ates are stored.
Late this evening Waterbury swore
to a warrant for the arrest of S. J.
Hankins and Percy Betts, who, he
says, aided "ah'd r abetted" the' girls in
their resistance to: him.
Hankins is connected with the law
office of .Charles Wesley Reed in San
Francisco, and had been called on by
the girls for advice.
Hankins and Betts were arrested
to-night, cave bail and will appear to
morrow morning in Justice Edgar's
court. During Waterbury's absence
to-day, and after his announcement
that he would return with his bride
to-morrow, the Misses Waterbury, as
sisted by neighbors, removed all of
the furniture in the residence. . They
stripped the house of everything
movable. The daughters deny the
shotgun story told by the father.
Acctl Man Stricken.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 14. â After lying

scious condition J. P. Smith, 94 years
old, was found prostrate to-day on a

avenue, where he had fallen while try
ing to help in a sudden illness.
The old man's head was- badly

days ago. Dr. H. M. Pond was called,
and after dressing the injury, pro

ings of the Water and Forest Associa
tion from Its inception.
Just before the_Jast session of the
California Legislature, the association
determined to see what could be done
to revise the laws of the State pertain
ing to water and Its distribution and
control. A committee was appointed
bj- the association to prepare a bill to
present to the Legislature and John D.
Works was selected to draft the re
quired bill and to present it at the
Legislature. The Immediate result waB
one of the warmest sectional fights that
the Slate of California has known.
Southern California sent its represen
tatives to Sacramento with instructions
to oppose the Works bill as strongly as
possible. They fulfilled the mandate In
the strictest way. The bill was de
frated. Back of it was the body of
engineers who had been making pre
liminary surveys in behalf of the
United States to conserve the waters of
California and professors of the Uni
versity of California end Stanford Uni
versity assisted in gathering the data
that was used at Sacramento in ad
vocacy of the Works measure.
Once more, at the last annual con
vention of the Water and Forest As
eoclatlcn in this city, the subject of
revislrgr the water laws of the State
came up fcr discussion. .The commit
tee on resolutions brought In a report
In which among other matters was the
following:
R*Â»olved. That in the oriRicn of the Water
mr.6 forest Association no radical changes In
tin? lrrlyatlr>B laws of California can be devised
that will operate satisfactorily and do Justice
to all section* of the State.
As the adoption of this resolution
would discountenance the previous at
titude of the association and all that
was done at Sacramento the resolution
was killed and in its stead was> adopted
a substitute that set forth that "in
view erf the main purpose of our organ
ization it is Impossible for the Watfer
and Forest Association to procure re
vision of the water laws of the State of
California."
John G. North had the selection of
fix members of the executive commit
tee of the Water and Forest Associa
tion as president. With the exception
of putting Holt in the place of Works,
who has been dropped. President North
has made no change In the executive
committee.

SPEAKS OF SUFFERINGS
T/lls of His Twenty Years
Spent in a Prison 'for
Struggling to Free Erin
Hopeful that some day Ireland will
be free, and grateful to those who have
suffered for thÂ«Â»ir loyalty, members of
tho Irish societies of San Francisco
gathered at Native Sons' Hall last
evening to pay tribute to Patrick J.
Finnegan, the noted patriot. The hall
was crowded and Air. Finnegran was
received with applause when he ap
peared to tell the story of his efforts
on behalf of Ireland.
"I cannot express my~*gratitude for
this reception." he said, "because words
fall me when I rind that so many warm
hearts are beating for our cause. In
It I see a protest against the tyranny
of England that some day must come
io an end. For twenty years I was
confined In an English dungeon, see-
Insr no one and haring but little food.
However, I know that there Is no Irish
patriot that would not Buffer as I have
done for our cause, nrcO I glory in the
thought that the Irishman's desire to
be free will never die. It will live un
til we are free and we again take our
place among the nations."
Continuing, Mr. Flnnegan told how
he was arrested with several others
at Sligo. convicted of high treason by
a jury in the selection of which he hart
no voice and then thrown Into prison,
only securing his releaas after his hair
had whitened with age â the best years
ot h!s life gone. But it had not broken
his spirit, he said, and until the end
he would fight for the freedom of his
coufttry. He counseled his audience to
stand together for the cause and" to
await the day the Irish volunteers gave
the word to strike.
Before Mr. Finnegan spoke an enter
taining programme was given. Chair
man Joseph P. Kelleher addressed the
audience on the purpose of the recep
tion, after which Miss Loretta Barr
sang two old Gaelic songs. She was
accompanied by her sister. Miss Fran
ces Barr. William Murphy recited two
patriotic compositions and was enthu
siastically applauded. Miss Annie
Rooney sang two solos, and was fol
lowed by Joseph P. Kelleher and John
CConnell, who danced the double
horppipe.
Aft*r a song by Professor Kearns
the Gaelic dancing began in earnest.
The Misses Bessie and Hazel Allen
danced a double Irish jig, after which
they wore recalled, whereupon they
danced a hornpipe. A four-hand reel
was gracefully danced by the Misses
May Uanley ar.'l May Ropers and Mas
tor Robert Alien and Joseph Laveira.
At the conclusion of the programme
the hall was cleared and every one en-
Joyed the dance until a late hour.
ANCIKNT AND MODERN
CANALS ARE DESCRIBED
Joseph Oldliam Gives Interesting Lec
ture Before the Pupils of the
Humboldt School.
An interesting, lecture from a tech
nical standpoint was delivered before
a class of students at the Humboldt
Evening School last night by Joseph
Oldham. Mr. Oldham, a naval archi
tect, chose as his subject "Canals and
Locks and Ships Which Pass Through
Them." He dealt not only with the
construction of canals, but also showed
what a vast aid they have been to
commerce.
The lecture was broad in scope, be
ginning with a brief history of the an
cient canals, a description of the first
canals In America, the origin and
power of canal locks, the first vessel
afloat on the Great Lakes and a com
parison of the trade on the "Soo" and
the Suez canals. Reference was also
made to the proposed Panama canal.
Mr. Olflham said he considered the
Panama route much better than the
Nicaragua, as it could be constructed
and maintained at less expense and
would also effect a saving of time.

BRIDGE PIER
MAY BE RUINED
Great Crack Is Discovered
in One of Supports of New
Third Street Structure
WORK OF A TEMBLOR
Severe Shock of Earthquake
Felt in and Around City,
but Little Damage Done
A severe earthquake was noticed in
and about this city at eight minutes
past 7 o'clock yesterday morning. The
vibration lasted four seconds, and is
described by Weather Expert McAdie
as a "twister," having, no general di
rection.' This was the fourteenth and
most severe shock noticed since the
first of the month, but Mr. McAdie says
there is nothing to be feared from these
disturbances, as they are simply caused
by a readjustment of the outer crust
of the earth.
City Engineer Woodward ascertained
yesterday that the concrete foundation
to be used as one/Of the supports for
the Third-Btreet bridge, now being built
at the foot of Third street by the Santa
Fe Company, is cracked six feet across,
the crack being three inches wide and
extending to low-water mark. Divers
will be sent down to find out if it eoes
any farther. The foundation Is sup
posed to weigh 2700 tons. If the crack
penetrates to the v mud line it will be
necessary to reconstruct the pier. The
situation is considered so serious that
the Eastern engineer- of the company
has been telegraphed for. A consulta
tion with City Engineer Woodward and
the engineer of the Thompson Bridge
Company, which .has the contract for
the bridge, will be held. It is thoueht
that the crack was caused by the earth
quake of December 10. The final pay
ment of $11,000 on the concrete work
was to have been made on the 20th
inst. The bridge was to have been com
pleted in the spring of 1905 at a cost of
$175,000. but the crack In the pier will
delay its completion indefinitely.
OAKLAND, Dec. 14.â A sharp earth
quake disturbed this city at 7:09 o'clock
this morning. -No damage was done.
VALLEJO, Dec. 14. â An earth

MISS STRUNSKY
TALKS ABOUT
POET MORRIS
The Forum Club, Mrs. Frank Fred
ericks president, enjoyed a red-letter
day yesterday when Miss Anna Strun
sky. the clever young Russian writer,
talked about William Morris, poet,
artist and socialist.
Of all the women who have been
heard in clubdom during the winter,
It is conceded, that Miss Strunsky is
the most fascinating physically and
the best equipped mentally. Hers is
a mind of strength and breadth and
depth â of tremendous heart and brain
qualities; and thus endowed, she car
ried her listeners through the splendid
life of the English scholar and think
er, revealing the great, joyful spirit
that dwelt in his breast, and the vast
love he held for his fellows.
His socialistic side, which appealed
strongly to Miss Strunsky, being her
self a staunch little socialist, showed
a complete revolution of the ideas of
his day, and even of our day. In his
palatial home, he entertained the cob
bler with the same keen enjoyment as
he did the banker, or the poet, loving
all equally well, and believing person
ality to be the only, mark of distinction.
And even this he would make unob
trusive, believing that there should be
a homogeneity of the people, rather
than sporadic developments among
them. ;-;â¢> "\Â£Â£ui.% '-'â â -I
Hope, joyfulness and usefulness
stamped his life with a seal of love,
and Miss Strunsky made each hearer
know and feel the influence of the man
who lived his whole beautiful life for
his fellows, leaving as a heritage the
now famous Socialistic Federation of
London. ,-.';
Preceding and following Miss Strun
sky, Aaron Cain gave three charming
tenor solos, which were warmly re
ceived.
Mr*. Emil Pohli made a short but
eloquent appeal for the purchase of the
Mill Valley grove of redwoods, which
is now about to be placed on the mar
ket for sale. : .<Â«,.,
While tea was being sipped Miss
Strunsky held a levee, in an embowered
corner, bearing in her arms a great
bunch of pink roses, the gift, of Mrs.
Thomas Morffew, who was hostess of
\he day.
Carabaos Meet.
The regular quarterly meeting of
Corral No. 3 of the Military Order of
the-Carabao, composed of officers of
the army and navy who served in the

Aspirants for Speakership
Are Beginning to Disclose
Their Plans of Campaign
PUESCOTT AND EOLLEY
Senator Hahn jf Pasadena,
Foremost of Frank Flint r s
Supporters, Comes to Town
'State Senator Benjamin W. Hahn of
Pasadena, . one of the foremost and
ablest advocates of the candidacy of
Frank P. Flint of Los Angeles for
United States Senator to succeed
Thomas R. Bard, is at the Palace Ho
tel. Mr. Flint is also in the city, ex
changing views with* leading men and
local statesmen^/ He has engaged
rooms at the Golden Eagle Hotel for
the Senatorial campaign at Sacramen
to. The rooms reserved Include those
occupied by General W. H. L. Barnes
during the memorable Senatorial â¢ con
test of 1S99. Senator Bard has engaged
rooms at the Capitol Hotel. It is said
that the â¢ Senator will arrive In this
city December 31 and remain in Cali
fornia until the election of his succes
sor is determined. \ ,
CONTEST VOW SPEAKER.
Assemblyman Frank C. Prescott of
Redlands is In town.*
Mr. Prescptt, when he â  arrived
here, was not prepared definitely to
announce his candidacy for the Speak
ership, but after a conference with
local Republicans he gave out this
positive statement late. last evening:
"I am a candidate." It is said in po
litical circles that he has an active
legion of supporters.
Assemblymen Philip A. Stanton and
J. P. Transue of Los Angeles arrived
in the city last evening. They .were in
Sacramento yesterday forenoon col
lecting hints on the Speakership. The
activity of the southern contingent has
caused messages to be sent to.Hum
boldt County, advising Assemblyman
George T. Rolley that "something is
doing."
Republican leaders are discussing
the question whether a special election
must be Immediately called to fill the
vacancy. in the Seventy-fifth Assembly
District, Los Angeles, caused by the
recent death of Assemblyman-elect : J.
H. Krimminger.
The common impression In legislative
camps that the Speakership will go to
an aspirant .residing in some county
other than Alameda has induced Sen
ator Frank W. Leavitt to enter the
race as a candidate for President pro
tern, of the Senate. A few days ago
there was talk that Senator E. I. Wolfe
would have a walkover for the honor
of presiding in the Senate during the
absence of Lieutenant Governor Alden
Anderson. If. the contest between Wolfe
and Leavitt should engender bitterness
Lietuenant Governor Anderson will go
into training to develop sufficient physi
cal strength to preside in the Senate
at all hours of the forthcoming Session.
CONTINGENT FUND.
Legislators are already^dlscussing the
perplexing question of patronage. The
open-handed- :and generous statesmen
favor $20 a day for each Senator and
$10 for each Assemblyman of the ma
jority. The. conservatives figure, that
$12 for Senators and $6 for members of
the lower house would~be about right.
The story goes that an allowance In ex
cess of the latter, apportionment would
not meet with executive, approval. The
Legislature, however, has control of its
own contingent fund. The Governor, of
course, can veto an appropriation for
contingent expenses If his judgment
demands such action, but the veto
power Is seldom used to curb such ex
travagance. Again, it is comprehended
that a Legislature bent on appropriat
ing money , for contingent expenses
would not hesitate to override an ex
ecutive veto.
It is probable that the Republican

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
JOHN D. SPRECKELS Â» â¢ Proprietor
ADDRESS ALL, COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN McNAUGHT â¢ â  Manager
PUBLICATION OmCB THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, SAN FRANCISCO
THURSDAY DECEMBER 15, 1904
THE SPIRIT OF THE MESSAGE.
TIME enough has gone by to enable consideration of the Presi
dent's message, in the light of the comment and criticism which
followed its deliver}-. The conclusion is that the message marks
a new epoch in our national history and in the condition of the
world. The opportunities of life here have been so extended and
developed and wrought out upon our abundant resources as to make
necessary less guardianship over the gaining of wealth and more over
its use. We have reached the parting of the ways and the final test
of free institutions. The very abundance of our natural resources
and the ready conversion of potential into present wealth make ne
cessary an extensive regulation of the power, which wealth can ex
ercise. Human nature being what it is, power will be riotously used
by its possessor, if the use be unrestrained.
Property has been accumulated here more rapidly than else
where and is more generally distributed because the country's latent
wealth is great, and its laws have perfectly protected the rights of
property. The law represents the judgment of society as to what
shall be held as property. The day being here in which the law must
regulate the power of property, two schools of thought are open at
the parting of the ways. Socialism is there crying out for govern
ment ownership of all the means of acquisition and distribution, and
for an equal division of the acquired wealth of the country. Taking
advantage of the economic principle that property exists at all only
in the assent of society, this school proposes that the social assent
to the existence of property shall be withdrawn, and all laws pro
tecting it repealed.
Xo one denies that that would be a. remedy. It is a proposition
to remove all danger from the power of property by destroying
property, abolishing private ownership and bestowing everything
upon everybody. This remedy, however, proposes that human energy
and enterprise and skill shall continue without the incentive of
personal acquisition. So it means the impossible and the impractica
ble. It means the stagnation of society, the rapid necrosis of energy
and the decline of effort to a minimum. But it is a remedy the evils
of which are in its future and unseen by those who support it.
Over against this is a school of politics, not partisanship, but
politics, of which President Roosevelt is the leader and exponent.
As such leader his message is written. Its spirit affirms that the
law has done well by promoting the creation and ownership of prop
erty; that the law has not thereby created a Frankenstein to turn and
destroy its creator, but that the creative function shall now be supple
mented by the regulative function, which shall place metes and
bounds around the power of property, and within them continue to
promote its acquisition and enjoyment.
It is in its corporate form that property has the greatest power.
Therefore its regulation in that form is the first necessity. The Pres
ident develops in high relief the function of the new Department of
Commerce in this connection. It has not come to destroy but to
fulfill. The law having created property for a good purpose, bene
ficial to the citizen, now comes on its mission of fulfillment, to carry
out the good purpose of property, not by destruction but by co
operation. The President leaves no ground possible of occupation in
opposition to him except that taken by Socialism. Every citizen
who is not a Socialist must stand with Roosevelt. There is no mid
dle ground. His message absolutely eliminates the actual Demo
cratic partv bv absorbing: it.
The President has advanced the political frontier until it is the
line between the two great schools â on one side a representative
democratic republic, led by the President ; on the other Socialism with
its banner inscribed "Property is robber}'." No genuine Jeffersonian
Democrat hesitates a minute as to where he belongs. His place is
beside the President, and that party disappears as a party and joins
the force which has uttered, through the President, the political gos
pel of the new epoch, "What the law has created the law must reg
ulate and discipline and not destroy." Men must now study the
politics of the new epoch, just as in 1896 their fears compelled them
to stud}' finance. The past is rolled up like a scroll. The anti-
British politics, that long survived the Revolution, is no more. The
sentimental politics that began in John Quincy Adams' defense of
the right of petition, and ended in the Civil War, is no more. The
sectional politics that followed that struggle and made its gibber and
jangle and tuneless inharmony pass for principles so long is no
more. We are face to face with a new phase in our national life and
a new issue. It has emerged out of conditions that have been our
pride and boast. It is the evolution of our natural resources ind
man's best opportunity, joined.
The President declares that that which came from a good
cause, for a good purpose, need not be, destroyed, lest it work
harm. It is our part to prove that free, representative government,
under universal suffrage, can deal with all problems that its freedom
has caused, with all property its laws have promoted, with all power
subordinate to its sovereignty, by conserving and regulating and not
by destroying. The President is the leader ; fall in !
The message is wonderfully illuminative of th'e political situa
tion. It is a classifying document, a stroke of political chemistrv
that discloses affinities. It puts Mr. Bryan and all his school, advo
cating government ownership of production and distribution, with
the Socialists, where they belong. They have been tum-tumming
partisan catgut under the national windows in the twilight as narm
less troubadours. The President's message is the policeman's dark
lantern turned on them and revealing them as porch climbers and
not minstrels.
So Roosevelt has not only disclosed a new epoch, new duties,
new dangers, but he has done what no man has done before him:
he has compelled and dictated the partisan alignment of the future.
WHEN THE RAINMAKER WORKS.
WE of the rainy belt will all watch with sympathetic interest
the promised work of the. new "rainmaker" in Los Angeles.
Wjth admirable assurance he has announced that before the
first of next May he will have extracted eighteen inches of moisture
from the azure skies of the southland : failing:, he will retire from
business and let niggardly nature handle her own precipitations.
Something in the proximity of $1000 as a side bet, contributed by
some of the Los Angelenos of sporting proclivities, adds jest to this
experimentation with the atmosphere.
Everybody has hopes of the ultimate s'uecess of the rain con
juror except the weather prophets. To them this tampering with
the immutable formulas of the elements can but strike terror to tSe
heart and call up vague fears for the peace of the skies elsewhere
Supposing, they argue, that this young man of Los Angeles lets off
chemical bombs in the cerulean vault and succeeds thereby in start
ing a miniature storm center to swirling over the desert, what will
happen in other portions of the heavenly territory? This sudden
condensation of the atmosphere over Southern California might sur
prise Kansas zephyrs into a little twister; the Oregon chinook might
be deflected to Cape Cod and its four feet of snow would disappear
in a breath; the gentle blizzard of the Dakotas, once disturbed out
of it's chosen territory, might make State street, Chicago, look like
Deadwood on a frosty morning. This tinkering with storm clouds
outdares Prometheus himself, say they.
But do they think of the glad surprise that must surely attend
eighteen inches of home-made rain down in the south? The gentle
Moqui, unwashed child "of the desert, must of necessity enjoy the
mysteries of his first bath. The labor-loving Mexican "will for the
first time learn that the roof of his 'dobe dwelling is not designed to
keep out sun alone and he will knock off. work on the section gan<*
to sit and watch the leaks leak. The peaceful cow-puncher will.mar
vel greatly, then look at the skies through numerous and various
glasses and shoot up the old town. Verily the varied display of
human emotions attendant upon this promised rainstorm will in itself
be worth the cost of producing it \
THE SAN FRANCISCO -GALL; THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1904.
LOVE IS BOTH AN ELEMENT
AND COMPOUND OF ELEMENTS
By Dorothy F^nimore
IS LOVE an entity? Or Is it com
posed of the various elements of
mind and spirit?
This query, which has been put
to me by a reader of The Call, I
am going to answer in Yankee
fashion, by a question of my own. Do
not both of the descriptions given
fit love well?
As the chief of human passions, love
is a single, a separate, thing. One may
consider it apart from the lover, as
a mighty influence on mortal destiny.
But, as the unified expression of the
entire being, it is made up of many
elements; it is the very self of the one
who loves.
In some respects the case is similar
to that of a musician's music or of a
painter's or a sculptor's art. Here the
technique Is one thing and the immor
tal soul behind it is another. Either
attribute may be judged separately;
but it takes both together to reveal the
artist's genius. The man is the instru
ment of his art; but, equally, the art
is the instrument of the man.
In love, the similar relationship is
.more intimate, more personal. Love
without the lover is an idea devitalized.
And, on the other hand, it means little
to say that a man loves, unless the
quality of his performance is stated or
implied.
In his book of eÂ»says called "The
Kinship of Nature,"? Bliss Carmen at
tempts a detailed definition of love.
I KNOW NOT WHY
I I '.ft mine eyes against the sky
The clouds are weeping, so am I;
I lift mine eyes again on hlsth;
The sun Is smllinK, so am I.
Why do 1 smile? Why do I weep?
I do not know; it lies too deep.
I hear the winds of autumn sigh,
They break my heart, they make me cry;
I hear the birds of lovely spring,
My hopes revive, I help them sing.
Why- do I sing? Why do I cry?
It lies so deep. I know not why.
âPhiladelphia Record.
NATURE
Walking out one day we met a fine
woman.
"I am Nature." said she, pleasantly.
We expressed our gratification, and
complimented her on the looks of the
woods and fields.
"Oh, yes," said Nature. "The arti
ficial digestion of food lets me out of a
lot of confining, thankless work, and
enables me to- get outdoors more."
We remarked that it seemed to agree
with her, whereat she thanked us, and
passed on. â Puck.
TOO MUCH PROGRESS
The City Council of Venice has voted
to buy several electric launches to be
used on the canals. The City Council of
Venice ought to be dumped into the
canals. The gondola should reign un
challenged in Venice, where, as in Flor
ence, every "modern improvement" is
an anachronism and an impertinence.
Florence has been much spoiled and
despoiled. Venice has lost the Cam
panile and gained the electric launch. â

NEEDED POSTING.
Pat â That spellbinder last noight said
he knew no North, South, East or
West.*<|pgÂ§B
Mikeâ And what did you tell him?
Patâ I told him he ought to study his
geography a bit.
Love, he says, is composed of three
parts. First, there is what we call the
physical element, that unreasoned,^ in
comprehensible attraction for another
which often' draws us In spite of our
better judgment and bur finer instinct.
The second constituent is spiritual; it
partakes of the nature of worship and
reverence. It leads to those beautiful,
enduring acts of devotion which are so
commonly associated with the idea of
love. But pride is the third constituent
of the passion of love. This is the men
tal manifestation of it. "No love," says
the essayist, "is complete without
pride. In the relations of men .and
women, pride is the savor of love."
There is an illustration in the pretty
story of Charlemagne's answer to a
courtier, who asked him whether he
held King Meliadus or his son Tristan
to be the better maiv. Thus replied the
emperor, wisely: "King Meliadus was
the better man, and I will tell you
why. As far as I can see, everything
that Tristan did was done for love, and
his great feats would never have been
done save under the constraint of love,
which his spur and goad. Now,
this same thing can never be said of
King Meliadus. For what deeds he did
he did them not by dint of love, but by
dint of his strong right arm. Purely
out of his own goodness he did good,
and not by constraint of love." ,
All this discussion is profitable in its
own way. It makes us entertainment
over the teacups; it is a good subject,
for speculation in a lonely idle hour.
But when we come down to the truth
of the matter, does it mean much more
to' you and to me than mere words and
a pleasant story? What really con
cerns us is not love as we reason it out,
not love as the romance depicts it for
us, but love as we feel itâ the dream,
the ecstacy, the strong, exultant thrill.
Preservation of Flowers.
Professor Constantine Gregory of
Naples has discovered a new chemical
process for the preservation of flowers
and leaves which has won a silver
medal from the Neapolitan Institute
for the Advancement of Science.
Plant leaves as - difficult of preser
vation as those of the orchid and the
begonia have been kept wonderfully
well by this method, and Professor
Gregory is hopeful of preserving even
fungi in a remarkably natural condi
tion.
Jiistlcc for Dandies.
The man who nowadays desires to
beautify his clothes either in color or
cut â knee breeches and silk stockings,
for instance â is generally suspected of
effeminacy. The suspicion may be well
founded, but at the same time, says
the Westminster Gazette^, we are
bound to admit that the teaching of
history does not confirm the idea that
any lack of manly qualities is the
necessary accompaniment of silks,
satins, velvets and lace.. '.
THE MODERN FIREMAN
The chief disconcerting feature of the
problem is to procure a man who will
be sufficiently muscled to withstand the
heavy manual labor at' present imposed
upon the fireman of the modern mas
todonic locomotive, and who at the
same time possesses the mental caliber
for locomotive engineer duty when his
time comes for promotion. This ideal
specimen of modern fireman must be
a man to whom nature has been un
usually kind in her endowment of both,
physical and mental strength. This
particular combination is distressingly
rare; hence, this troublesome feature of
the problem. â Railway and Locomotive

FOR ART'S
SAKE.
By Izola Merrifield.
IT WAS nobody's fault but her own.
Whenever trouble came a-knock
ing at Philippa's door, all kind
friends raised hands of innocence
to the skies and declared .thank
fully that it was nobody's fault
but her own.
"He had no earthly right to raise
his hat and smile when I met him in
the elevator."
"He had every right in the world,"
"Before I go I want to know
if I may tell her."
contradicted Elizabeth calmly. "If
I had been in his place I should have
come right down and called on you,
after you had acted like a love-lorn
lunatic, Philippa."
"It was not lunacy! It was inspira
tion!"" Philippa half turned from the
piano to argue. "You weren't in the
studio at the time, Beth, and you don't
know a blessed thing about it. I
wasn't even practicing. I was clean
ing up."
Elizabeth smiled. She had seen
Philippa's cleaning up process. It
meant the hustling of everything dis
orderly out of sight, -under the divan,
behind the wardrobe, anywhere at all,
so long as it was unseen.
And he sang my pet duet from 'II
Trovatore.' Beth, it was splendid.
You poor old heathen, you don't ap
preciate music u bit. .->Â«! you can in
derstand are a tew oily dauby-daubs,
or a pen-and-ink , sketch, but if you
had only heard him- â -"
"If I had heard him I don't think
that I should have flown to the win
dow, and warbled back an answer up
a New York air shaft." \
"I don't care." Philippa's tone was
lofty, and her attitude belligerent. "I
didn't care a rap about him personal
ly, and I hadn't the slightest idea
what he looked like, but the voice was
divine. It was the voice of 'Manrico*
calling, and 'Leonora' answered it for
art's sake."
"Well, 'Leonora' had better attend
to her cleaning up and mind her own
business. Now she hasn't any cause
for complaint at all, because 'Manrico'
raises his hat to her in the elevator
and says !howdy' in neighborly fash
ion. Are you sure that it was 'Man
rico?' "
"Oh, yes. He looks it," Philippa
spoke with vague enthusiasm. "And
Lafayette says that he Is the new one
in the studio over ours."
"Well, you had better send Lafay
ette a little printed slip to post up in
his elevator:
"'Students may sing grand opera
duets through the air shaft, but any
promiscuous greetings in elevator will
be followed by eviction.' "
"I suppose the poor fellow was so
amazed and delighted when he saw
how completely I fulfilled his ideal of
'Leonora' that he lost his presence of
mind." Philippa could be as sweetly,
simply and contentedly vain as Nar
cissus among the water lilies.
â j "Presence of mind is never lost."
Elizabeth added a high light dalntily
to the left eye of an Italian fruit ven
dor on the canvas before her. "It is
mislaid. As long as he didn't lose his
heart he needn't worry."
j Philippa laughed and ran her fin
gers teasingly over the piano keys.
"I ,think he is worrying," she said.
But there .were no more duets
through the air shaft. If the occupant
of- studio 5, on the third floor, hap
pened to be practicing her trills and
quavers .the occupant of studio 7, on
the fourth floor, sat by his open win
dow and listened, and when a full,
rich tenor floated down from studio 17
Philippa would tiptoe to the window
and listen also and be glad and proud
in a way, because somewhere in the
golden to-morrows of hope success lay
snugly and surely tucked away for
the .tall, brown-eyed boy who dared
to greet' "Leonora" in the elevator.
He had "dared" only once. Long
after even Elizabeth deigned to. bow
a comradely good day to him, Philip
pa passed on her own way, a slim, ar
rogant, blonde young person In gray
velvet and squirrel furs. Elizabeth
preserved a graceful posture on the
neutral fence. | Warring factions were
not â '. in her line,' but when she was
sending out invitations for the month
ly: Dutch picnic in studio 5 she did
not think it amiss to send one up to
studio 17.
Philippa was , passing club sand
wiches when Bobble Clarkson intro
duced her to the tall, brown-eyed
boy. ' She did not drop the tray. She
merely smiled most graciously and
asked if Mr. Eliot liked club sand
wiches made of a celestial combina
tion of chicken salad, chopped al
monds, olives, - deviled ham and to
basco sauce.
It appeared that Mr. Eliot did. In
fact, ; he paced after the dispenser of
celestial' sandwiches all around the
studio ,in a deliberate, determined,
man ' overboard ! fashion, most dlscon-

when a harmonious contingent was
present. The hostesses, Mrs. H. E.
Huntington. Mrs. Linda Bryan and
Miss Spieker gave charming hospitality
and succored the Interests of the;
friends and guests most successfully.
Mrs. Theodore J. Hay was the guest
of honor at a luncheon given yester
day by Mrs. William Alfred Rogers.
Mrs. Hay is visiting San Francisco
from the East and will be the recipient

ACTION FOR DAMAGESâ R., Davis
ville, Cal. If any one sustains dam
ages through the acts or neglect of a
county official the party affected or
parties in law empowered so to do
have a right to sue the county for the
recovery of compensation for damages
sustained- As to the particular mat
ters contained in the letter of inquiry
such would have to be submitted to
an attorney for his advice.
NATIONAL HOLIDAYS â A. D.
McK., Paris, Cal. There are no na

There are legal holidays which are ob
served in all States and Territories,
such as Sunday, New Year's day,
Washington's birthday. Memorial day,
Fourth of July, Labor day, Christmas,
Thanksgiving day and day of general
election, but all such days are so de
clared by v the Legislature of each
State and not by Congress. That body
passes laws of that kind only for the
District of Columbia.
NAVAL ORDNANCE â Constant
Reader, Yountville, Cal. The United
States naval ordnance table says that
the charge for a three-inch gun is five
pounds of smokeless powder and a
certing to the dispenser, until he final
ly cornered her in the Japanese alcove
and forcibly finished up the remaining
sandwiches himself.
. "And he never even said a word
about the ,duet," Philippa answered
later, when she sat, like a Hindoo idol
in a pink kimona on the bed and
thoughtfully reviewed the evening.
"He's a gentleman and a scholar. And
Bobbie saps he's all right. Solid, old
Maryland family and all that sort of
thing. First name's Marbury, Mar
bury Eliot. He has only been in New
York a couple of months and he
doesn't like it very well. He thinks
it's lonesome. He says we're conser
vative and clanish."
. "There's a good remedy. Tell him
to be a clam unto himself."
Philippa shied a pillow at the scof
fer.
"Goose," she said. "Can't you see?
He wants to belong to my clan. I'm
going to the Czacga concert with him
to-morrow." -,~*-~.
"See? Of course I see," quoth
Elizabeth. VOne Philippa Yates,
founder of the Society for the Pre
vention of Lonesomeness to Strangers
in New York, providing said strangers
are' gentlemen and scholars, from solid
old families and can sing duets and
eat club sandwiches for art's safe. I
see the end."
But- Philippa only smiled and was
silent. It had been a most entertain
ing and Interesting twenty minutes
spent In the Japanese corner. One's
point of view on life in general may
alter considerably even in twenty min
utes. - -^ -
It was two weeks after the Czarga
concert. Philippa came out of the
Metropolitan Opera-house as Eliot
swung tip Broadway. It had begun to
snow at sundown and there was the
lull In traffic that comes on the great
White Way between dinner time and

WORDS IN USEâ Subscriber, City.
The vocabulary of those who speak
and write the English language is
small compared with the number of
words in a dictionary. Dr. Bloom
laugh, In "Gleanings for the Curious.*"
says: "Dictionary English is some
thing very different, not only from col-
Icqulal English, but even from that of
ordinary written composition. There
is probably no author in the Ianguaga
from whose wcrks. however volumin
ous, so many as 10,000 words could be
collected. We would be surprised to
find, if we counted them, with how
small a number of words we managa
to express all that we have to say,
either with our lips or with our pen.
Our common literary English probably
hardly amounts to 10,000 words; our
common spoken English hardly to
5000."

FOR PERJURY
Admits on the Stand That
His Testimony in the Di
. voice Trial Was Untrue
ASSAULTS HIS FATHER
'JVlls of Breaking a Cane
Over Parent's Head to
Save Himself a Beating
ThÂ» Monni^r will contest in Judge
Graham's court yesterday took a se
rious aspect for iho contestant, George
Monnier, when he testified that he had
deliberately given false testimony some
time ago in the divorce proceedings in
stituted against his wife, Violet Mon
nicr. Attorney George D. Collins also
fcrcr-d the witness to admit that he
was compelled to leave the city at that
'time to avoid arrest for perjury in con
nection with his application for a mar
riage license. He also admitted that he
w&a engaged to a young woman of
tseaca at the same time he waa en
gaged to his present wife, and that he
broke his word with the young woman
of rneana when he got married to an
other.
Ycurg Monnier was on the stand all
day yesterday and during a greater
part of tiie session was subjected to an
exhaustive and penetrating cross-ex
amination by Attorney Collins. He was
made to repeat in detail the particulars
â¢ BX every quarrel that ever took place
between himself and the members of
his family and to tell of the troubles
with his wife. He told in detail what
be said was the only serious quarrel
with his father, in which both sides
used weapons, George Monnier break
ing a cane over his father's head and
wounding him. Collins at
tempted to make the witness admit that
it was this blow that hastened his
father's death, but witness evaded a di
rect answer.
. The witness was also questioned as
to his marriage with Violet Monnier
and his subsequent separations from
her for various lengths of time. During
his examination Tuesday by Attorney
'Koche. Monnier said that the reason he
separated from his wife was through
the influence exerted by his mother.
â  When Collins resumed the cross"-ex
urcinauon yesterday he asked Monnier
Again for the cause of his separation
and received the same answer. Then
Collins referred to the testimony of the
witness given at the time of the divorce
proceedings, in which he swore that he
separated from his wife because she
**fired" him out of the house and re
fused to live with him.
"Is this statement the truth?" asked
Collins.
"â¢No." replied Monnier. "it is false.
I lpft my wife because of my mother's
influence."
"Then this statement made by you
;:nder oath at the time of the divorce
111*1 is false?"
. "Yes."
"Did you know that you were swear
ing falsely?"
. "Yes."
Throughout the questions asked by
Collins both Sullivan an* Roche con
stantly objected, but their objections
were overruled by the court. The
mtthod of cross-examination by Col
lins and the introduction of Monnier's
testimony at the trial were both
strenuously objected to.
It was shown that Monnier Jr. had
left the city during annulment pro
<?Â«.-edir.gs instigated by Monnier Sr. to
avoid arrest for perjury, he having
eworn falsely as to his age at the time
of marriage.
Monnier then testified to the seri
ous quarrel between himself and his
father in ISO 2. The elder Monnier
v.as working in the garden when his
son made & disparaging remark that
fingered the old man. Seizing a gar
den implement, Monnier chased his
son into the house and struck him on
the shoulder. Young Monnier grabbed
a cane to defend himself and succeed
ed so well that he broke the cane
across his father's head.
Collins then attempted to make the
witness admit that this blow hastened
his father's death from cerebral apo
plexy and asked Monnier if he had
ever heard his father say to his moth
er. "Anna, take these two pieces of
cane and put them in my coffin when
I die." The witness said he heard no
6uch remark. He added that he and
his father effected a reconciliation the
mcralng after the quarrel.
Ccllins further attempted to recall
â to the witness an alleged accusation
l>y his father of stealing money from
his mother's dress and alleged assaults
on his father with cha!rs. bottles and
a stove lifter. All these allegations
the witness evasively den fed. The
case will gt> on this morning at 10
o'clock.

â  Beatrice Sidlowski, the two-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Z. Sidlowski
of 2602 Sacramento street, died yester
day morning under circumstances that
obliged Coroner Leland to order an
inquest. The child was suffering with
croup, and at 4 o'clock in the morning
Mr. SidiowEki got out of bed to ad
minister a dose of hive syrup to the
child. He lighted a candle and poured
out a teaspoonftil of what he believed
to be the svrup and handed it to the
mother. As Mrs. Sidlowski was
placing the spoon to the child's lips
she smelled carbolic acid and took
Ihe spoon away again.
The mother is positive that the
child took no part of the acid. At 6
o'clork the infant died. An autopsy
will be h*Â»Id to-day to determine the
cause of death. The acid and the hive
syrup were kept in similar bottles on
the same table.

PARTLY HIS OWN FAULT
President McKinley's Commanding
Officer During the War Subject
of Coroner's Investigation.
During a portion of the Civil Wax
Martin V. RiUer was captain in an
Ohio regiment and in his company
and obeying his orders dutifully was
a private soldier named William Mc-
Kinley. The ' private" soldier became
President of the United States and
was killed by an assassin. The cap
tain became a customs inspector in
the San Francisco Custom-house -and
was killed on November 29 of this
year by beingr run over by a railway
train. In the inquest on the veteran's
body yesterday a Coroner's Jury re
turned a verdict that his death was
due "partly to his own carelessness
in standing on the track where trains
occasionally pass and partly to the

Curse Upon Chorus Girl,
Not Admitted in Evidence
PICKS FBUIT AND SEWS
Doctors Wife Tells of Her
Efforts to Earn Living.
Husband Names Successor
There was never any friendliness be
tween Myrtle Scott Estes arid" her
mother-in-law, but the most signifi
cant passage regarding their enmity
contained in the- chorus girl's deposi
tion was not admitted in evidence.yes
terday by Judge Kerrigan. It was a
letter purporting to have been written
by Mrs. Rebecca Estes a few weeks be
fore Dr. Estes and Miss Scott were
married. The note, as read for identifi
cation, was as follows:
Miss Scott â You arÂ« a human fiend. How
dare you 'phone to my (bouse? Are you not
satisfied that you have ruined my son, de
stroyed his health and broken up his. practice?
He Is now on tha verze of insanity . and - has
been lying between 'life and death for -two
days. May a mother's curse rest on you aa
long as you live and follow you wherever you
are. For God's saks, what has ha done - that
you should drive him to his death? This much
I know: If 1 ever meet you In his /office
strain I will horsewhip you If it is the' last
thins I do on earth. .And more . than that, wÂ«
will have you arrested for soliciting money.
He tells roe you drew money out of the. bank
which you had no business to do. Why are
such devils as you kt live? 1 wish you would
send this letter to your aunt that she may
know what I think of you. \l will, sign my
self "Glrley" and "Little Myrtle" and "Tour
Poor Little Orphan" and any other name you
are always pleading poverty and sickness under
and working on peoples' sympathies.
There were a great many other
things in the deposition, mostly ; having
to do with Estes' failure to provide for
his wife. On many occasions, she said,
he would not pay their board bilte. and
in Alaineda she paid the room rent by
sewing for the landlady. Part of the
time she supported herself by sewing
for $6 a week; again she was a chorus
girl, and at another time she dressed
the leading lady at Fischer's. For
three months she and Estes worked in
the Santa Clara orchards picking and
cutting fruit. He only worked a third
of the" time and was, she said, often un
der the influence of opium. Fearing he
would take an overdose, she took the
drug away from him. and then woke up
in the night to find him standing over
her with a broken ax. "I am going to
end it all," he said, according to her
evidence. She says, too, that once he
grabbed her by the throat. To-day sev
en or eight witnesses will be examined
in her behalf. , r v 7
A oiano player's desire to have his
wife get a divorce and marry a sailor
was partly realized in Judge Graham's
court yesterday. Mrs. A. Schreiner was
given an interlocutory decree from Per
cy Schreiner, who is following his mu
sical bent in Tacoma. A letter in Ger
man was introduced in evidence, and in
it the husband said he could not sup
port a wife. He advised her to get a di
vorce, and said he would send Joe
Fisher, a sailor, down to marry and
take care of her.
Blanch G. Meyer yesterday had, her
marriage with William H. Meyer an
nulled by Judge Graham bepause of de
celt practiced by the man. He was a
friend of the girl's family. He came
from New York and sent word that he
was sick at the Lick House. The un
sophisticated maiden went there- to
nurse him, and after her attentions he
told her that If she did not marry him
her. reputation would be ruined, though
she had done nothing wrong.
Judge Murasky denied the motion for
a new trial in the case of Maud A.
Wllkereon against Ira Puerl Wilkerson.
The plaintiff, otherwise Maud Amber,
formerly of Fischer's and now in Aus
tralia, got a divorce on the ground of
Infidelity. The husband sought to re
oiyn the case on the contention that
his wife was not a resident of Califor
nia when the decree was granted.
Judge Kerrigan granted a divorce to
Corinne A. Bartlett from Ward S. Bart
lett for neglect, and Judge Murasky did
the same for Sarah E. Ackerman from
John Q. Ackerman for desertion.

BROKEN SEWERS
ARE EXPENSIVE
City Engineer Says More
Money Has Been Spent on
One Than New Drain Costs
CITES SPECIFIC CASE
Acquisition of Municipal
Water Supply Seems to Be
Farther Away Than Ever
City Engineer- Woodward filed his
annual report for the year ending
June 30, 1904, with the Board of
Works yesterday. The report states
that while . the appropriation of the
office was the same as the year before
the business has greatly increased.
Street improvements aggregating
$586,343 54 in cost were made and the
increase in the number of matters of
various classes referred to the bureau
for report has been about 50 per cent.
The receipts from fees for lot surveys
have increased over $3000. The re
port continues:
"The miserable condition of our
sewers will in a measure be remedied
by the recent bond issue. One of the
worst cases, that of Sixth street, was
not provided for and more money has
been spent for cleaning the sewer on
the one block between Folsom and
Harrison streets than would pay for a
new one. Some attention should be
given to the matter of securing rights
of way for drainage purposes.
"The specifications for asphalt pave
ment should be so changed as to al
low the use of . California oil asphalts
when of proper quality, they having
proved very satisfactory for j pave
ments. Your attention Is called to the
damage resulting to pavements from
their improper use. Ordinances should
be passed at once providing for the
use of springs on trucks, regulating
the tire widths, limiting loads and
providing for a more thorough inspec
tion of pavement repairs.
"Among the various important mat
ters is the establishment and change
"of official grades. An appropriate
charter amendment will be prepared
by this bureau to simplify the method
in order that we may be able to ac
tually change the grade of a street as
well as to effect a change upon paper.
"Another subject for a bond issue
would be the widening of Sansome
street from Jackson northerly to the
bay. This would furnish a much de
sired means of approach to the water
front and relieve congested traffic.
The property to be/acquired could be
taken from * the = western side of the
street where the improvements are of
small value. The necessity for a prop
er bridge over . the. Southern Pacific
Railroad at San Jose and Mount Ver
non avenues is apparent to any one
who goes to Ocean View. It Is hoped
that an appropriation for the im
provement will be 5 made in the next
budget.
"After all the years of endeavor, the
thousands of dollars spent, the engag
ing of special engineers, the work in
the field and in the office, the visits to
Washington, the memorial to Con
gress, it would seem that the acquisi
tion of water rights on the Tuolumne
River as a source of municipal water
supply is farther away than it was
hoped when the subject was first con
templated. The decision of Secretary
Hitchcock denying .the application of
San Francisco' for* reservoir sites ?at
Hetch Hetchy Valley "and Lake Elea
nor is based upon an unexpected rea
son, for it is difficult to understand
why San Francisco should be refused
its" absolutely needed water supply be
cause of the construction of two reser
voirs or lakes in the summit of the
Sierras taking up less than' four
square miles of the 1500 square miles
of the National Park."
Van Den Bergh Diamonds.
Judge Seawell, who has had the
case under submission, yesterday de
cided in favor of the defendant in the
suit of Harriet P. Van den Bergh
against Albert Van den Bergh for the
recover> r of $2500 worth of diamonds.
The plaintiff was the wife of Dr. John
P. P. Van den Bergh, but was divorced
from him about a year and a half
before his death, which occurred five
years ago. After his death the doc
tor's son, Albert, took a safe contain
ing the Jewels and claimed it as his
own. Mrs. Van den Bergh contended
that her husband had given her the
diamonds In Sacramento in 1874, a
short time, after their marriage Be
fore their divorce she declined to wear
the gems and they were put in the
safe. She says she did not bring suit
for their recovery sooner, because the
estate was In litigation.

of San I Leandro, who are anxious to
adopt the abandoned babe, visited the
San Francisco Foundling .Asylum yes
terday.*
The couple were drawn to the pretty
little fellow at first sight. The baby
cooed when Mrs. McLaughlin took it in
her arms, and she could hardly bear to
give It back to: the nurse. The Mc-
Laughlins wanted to take the child
away with them, but certain formali
ties must be complied with before they
can obtain possession of the infant.
McLaughlin is station master at San
Leandro, and he has one of the pret
tiest little homes In the State. He and
his wife have long wanted a child to
fill a vacant place in. the house. . When
they read the story of ..the. waif they
decided to take the little foundling and
rear it as their own.
Mrs. McLaughlin is impatient to eet
possession of the little ' one. and will
probably remain in town until -she does.

OUR. SEATTLE
STOCK IN S. F.
First time in 20 years that we have offered a discount on pianos, but wa
can see the public appreciates that this is no ordinary opportunity. We have
sold more pianos last week and the Oeginninp of this week than have ever
been sold in any music store In the United States as far as we know in sdrae
space of time. Actual number runs over 100 pianos up to to-day. We still have
over 150 pianos for you to select from. Don't wait; make your selection now.
We will pive you your own terms, but every piano of our Seattle stock must
be out of our San Francisco warerooms before the first of the year. If you are
not ready to buy we will rent you a piano from $2.00 per month up and allow you
all you have paid during the first six months to npply toward the purchase of the
piano you have rented or any other you may select. 1J you have an old piano we
will allow you all it can be sold for. This is more than any other house will do.
It costs you nothing to look over this store and we will set any piano aside until
the first. This opportunity to get such values will never occur again.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. DECEMBER 15. 1904.
YEARLY CHAT
OF MAGNATES
Powers of Pacific Coast
Baseball League Assemble
to Talk Business To-Day
The campaign for the baseball sea
son of 1905 in the Pacific Coast League
will be outlined to-night, when the
magnates come together for their an
nual session. Most of them are at
present in this city and thd absentees
will arrive to-day. Before the meet
ing is ended Spokane/may be formally
admitted within the fold, though there
is a strong possibility the league will
continue with six clubs.
The first matter of business will be
the official awarding of the pennant
for the season of 1904 to the Ta
coma Tigers. Then the regular rou
tine work of the organization will be
taken up and some new ones sprung.
It does not appear at present, however,
that any startling changes are to be
made, though something startling is
always liable to happen.
Spokane is anxious to cast its for
tunes with the Pacific Coast League
and it is likely she would readily be
accommodated but for the fact that
there is no other available city to take
in along with the northern town. Some
thought of Fresno, but it was amply
demonstrated last season that the
Raisin City would not draw enough to
pay the ground-keeper's salary even
with a winning team like Tacoma,
There is a lot of talk being handed
out. in semi-official circles that the
California magnates would like to cut
loose entirely from the- three north
ern towns. They have not been bread
winners in the past and were it not
for Los Angeles and San Francisco a
lot of money would have been lost. As
the northern towns are in there is lit
tle possibility of their being side
tracked this year at least.
Uncle Henry Harris will be asked
to come through with about $300 for
allowing his captain to take the Seals
off the field when they were playing
with Portland a few weeks ago. ' Har
ris was not present that time, but he
will be forced to show the color of his
coin. Morley was made to suffer last
year for the same offense and there
is no way for Harris to avoid a similar
fate.
' Umpires will be appointed at the
coming meeting by the president. Jim
McDonald looks a cinch, but the other
two are in the dark. Perrine was not
so bad and is deserving of a steady
Job. The trouble Browne got into
dewn in Los Angeles a few days be
fore the season closed will probably
go against him, for Morley will com
plain if the others mention Browne's
name. . .-
It is likely the double season will be
on the card once, again. If" worked
well last year and made the race close
in each half, though the alleged cham
pionship series between the Tigers and
the Angels did nothing to help the
game in any manner or form.
WOULD REVISE ATHLETICS
IX BOTH UNIVERSITIES
Freshmen May Be Barred From Tak
ine Part in Snorts Durinz First
Year in College.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 14.
The Joint faculty athletic committee
from Stanford and the University of
California has recently made recom
mendations concerning changes in in
tercollegiate athletics, which if adopt
ed by the intercollegiate agreement
committee will greatly change the tone
of future athletic games. The prin
cipal change proposed is that no fresh
man shall.be allowed to participate in
any athletic contest between Califor
nia and Stanford during his first year
in college.
The faculty has two motives in pro
posing such an amendment to th*Â»
present athletic agreement. The
first is the raising of the stand
ards of first-year scholarship. It
is maintained that athletics take up
too much of the student's "time. The
second motivo'of -the faculty is based
on entirely different reasons. Barring
a freshman from athletics would it is
held, cut off that class of students
which comes to a university for the
sole purpose of taking part in varsity
contests. '
It Is not probable that these recom
mendations will be accepted by the
student bodies of the two universities
Too many good athletes would be lost
and the competition for places on the
varsity teams would not be so keen
The proposed changes will be given
aThearing at the next meeting of the
intercollegiate agreement committee
composed of Stanford and California
graduates.

BOMBARDIER FINISHES FIRST
WITH MILITARY MAN SECOND
Pretty and Exciting Finish
for Handicap at Track
Across the Bay.
CHOICES OUT OF LUCK
Red Cross Nurse Is Heavily
Backed and AVins All
- , .
BY FRED E. MULHOLL\XD.
When Frank Skinner's three-year-old
Bombardier, ridden by Henry Michaels,
defeated Military. Man. the 4 to. 5 fa
vorite a neck for the mile and seventy
yard handicap at Oakland yesterday,
it was a staggering blow for the talent.
For some reason the Ferguson colt
had been "doped" a cinch, the books
being bombarded with coin until by
degrees the price was forced down
from 7 to 5.
The heavy going fitted Bombardier
like a glove and Michaels took him out
in front. Part of the way Helgesen
was second with the favorite, then he
found some deep going on the far turn
and Little Wally took the second posi
tion. Helgesen selected the best foot
ing in the run to the stand, while Bom
bardier bore in to the rail where it
was heaviest. Despite this handicap
the latter colt stood a fierce drive, win
ning by a neck.
Leila, badly handled, finished third;
beaten -but a neck and half a length,
and should have won by herself. From
twos-the odds about Bombardiers'oared
to '16 to 5. .
FAVORITES IX HARD LUCK.
It is unnecessary to state that the
favorites played in hard luck. Any
time the track is good and bad in*
patches, upsets may be expected! Dr.
Sherman had the honor of being the
only successful public choice.
Bronze Wing started for the first
time in the colors of Steve Judge and,
with Helgesen in the â  saddle, went to
the post a 7 to 10 favorite in the bet
ting on the opening -event. The first
choice cut out the running for nearly
seven-eighths of a mile, >hen he was
passed by "Big Bill" Knapp on Lady
Kent and was beaten somewhat hand
ily. Gin Spray, a 30 to 1 shot, finished
a fast closing third. - '.
Carelessness on the part of his rider,
W.' Davis, lost the .two-year-old scram
ble for Golden Buck, the odds-on
choice. Johnny Schorr'slcplt had shak
en off Fay Ttempleton an dapparently
had the race in hand. -Davis, however,
failed to observe Ara closing strongly
under Sam Greenfield's vigorous riding,
and the decision went against him by
a head. Fay Templeton took the show.
Dr. Sherman came back after a
night's repose and grabbed the seven
furlong purse from Hipponax. The Doc
tor ruled an 8 to 5 favorite, and in a
driving finish disposed of Hipponax by
a neck. The latter horse led into the
stretch, and only for some' interference
near the close might have won. Red
Damsel, away. poorly, ran a good third.
DECISION IS CLOSE.
So close was the finish between Bell
Reed and Alice Carey at the close of
the Futurity course sprint, fifth to be
decided, that quite a gathering mani
fested their disapproval by hooting the
decision. There is no doubt that
Alice Carey was best and should have
won, but Alarie in the full exuberance
of his joy at the thought of winning
two days in succession tossed the
money away. The judges probably did
not err in giving Bell Reed, the mount
of Sherwood, the verdict. Albemarle,
the favorite, ran a fair third. The win
ner's odds under a stiff play dropped
from 3% to 2% to 1.
There are certain kinds of mud that
Red Cross Nurse can run in, it would
appear, and the right number was
struck yesterday. With Sam Greenfield
in the saddle, the mare galloped out in
front all the way in the final mile and
a sixteenth number, winning cleverly at
the wire from Isabellita and Major Ten
ny, the latter the favorite. The winner
received extensive support at odds. of
6 to 1.
TRACK NOTES.
\V. Davis has not been feeling well
for a few days and his manager, Wil
lie Harris, has decided not to allow
him to accept any outside mounts for
a week or so. This will confine his
saddle work to the Jennings stable
alone.
Sammy Greenfield was the only, rid
er to pilot two winners.
Arisbe, the crack' filly owned by
Napa Stock Farm, makes her first
start of the season to-day.
W. Davis, who rode Golden Buck,
got away from the post poorly and
then after having the race won threw
it away.
Bookmaker Joe Harlan .handled
517,000 on the six races. Thi3 looks
as if there was some money in the
ring.
The fusillade of Tuesday was too
severe for five books, as but eighteen
cut in yesterday. Some layers are
imbued with the idea that every day
should be a winning one. These
wouldn't do to mix up In the Law
son-Greene-Rockefeller frenzied fin
ance scrap.
"Big Bill" Knapp, who piloted Hip
ponax, lodged a claim of foul against
W. Davis, rider of Dr. Sherman. The
Judges refused to consider it, but nine
out of ten close observers think Dr.
Sherman should have been disquali
fied.
Bronze Wing has finished second on
seven different occasions this season.
The yearlings bred at Theodore
Winter's Rancho del Sierras will bÂ«i
sold by Chase & Co. on December 19.
Red Cross Nurse, winner of \ the
last event. -was bid' up from $400 to
$800 by Billy Magrane.^ â¢ Molero &
Josephs retained their mare.
The colors . of ""Kansas" Price will
be seen for the first time when Sweet
Kitty Bellalrs goes to the post this
afternoon.

BRITT SEEKS
NO SYMPATHY
"If. "Nelson Wins He Beats
3Je at. my Best,*' Are the
Words of the Native Son
As the davs roll by and the night of
the battle gradually approaches Jimmy
Britt takes even more kindly to the
strenuous task he has undertaken.
There seems nothing lacking now.
Every one who professes to know the
game of fisticuffs agrees that Brltt is
fit, but he insists on working at a hair
raising clip, and nothing seems to stop
him from the moment he enters h:3
gymnasium at the Seal Rock House.
VAs I have said before. Nelson beat 3
me at my best If he beats me next
Tuesday night." That is the way Britt
sizes ud the situation. "I don't want
sympathy. It's the congratulations ol
ray friends I am looking for. I will say
In advance that there will be no com
plaint from me If Nelson gains the ver
dict. If such should be the outcome of
the fight he beats me at my best."
Every one around Camp Britt is sat
isfied with the turn affairs have taken.
â¢â¢Spider" Kelly declares modestly that
James never worked like this In his
life before. Frank Rafael can swear
he was never hit so hard by any boxer,
while "Tiv" Krellng Is sure Jimmy gets
rougher and tougher every time they
come together in the period of rough
and-tumble that comes off each day.
The spectators increase in numbers
right along. Yesterday there 'was a
mob present, and it was hard work to
keep the gymnasium cleared for action.
The crowd took on an enthusiastic at
titude, and a volume of applause greet
ed Britt and his sparring mates after
each round they reeled off m record
time.
Jimmy put Rafael down In thÂ« third
spasm of their little mixup. He landed
a right and a left on the Jaw while
forcing Frank around the ring, and the
latter could not keep his feet an in
stant longer. It was a spirited mixup
and both were perspiring and dishev
eled after it was over. The go -with
Kreling contained the usual amount of
hugging and wrestling, and Jimmy
managed to maul the stocky little
wrestler around and keep him going all
the time.
After going through his gymnasium
work Jimmy Jumped on the scales and
the beam tipped exactly at 134^ pounds.
He says the plunge in the surf takes
off half a pound each day, besides
hardening the skin and acting as an all
around tonic. Britt never misses two
dally dips, and there is always a crowd
on hand to see him make the daring
plunge.
"I am having quite a time to keep a
couple of pounds above the mark," said
Britt. "I drink all the liquids I want,
including a bottle and a half of porter
before retiring each night. I don't feel
like getting down too fine yet. for I like
to have a few pounds leeway. If neces
sary I can be at weight at a few hours*
notice, so no one need have any fears
on that score, as weight is the easiest
thing I am up against."
Battling Nelson is still grinding away
for his coming battle with Britt. A
large crowd of sporting men Journeyed
to the camp yesterday to watch the
Dane work. All were greatly pleased
with his condition. Young Mitchell and
some friends were among those present.
Bat went through his usual gym
nasium stunts and then boxed a few
rounds each with Eddie Santry and
"Stockings" Kelly.
"Rawhide," as Kelly Is now called,
was cautious of Bat, as he doesn't
wish to see another vision of his future
home.
In the morning Nelson, accompanied
by Marvin Hart and Eddie Santry,
took a tramp to the summit of Mount
Tamalnals. Hart Is working for a pros
pective fight with Kid McCoy. After a
brisk rubdown Nelson weighed 132^
pounds.' He seems to be in the pink of
condition and wishes the date of the
flght was nearer.
Britt a Strons FaTorite.
The first bets on the Brltt-Nelson
flght were recorded yesterday. Brltt
opened a strong 8 to 10 choice.. From
the volume of money offered on him
it is expected these odds will be ham
mered down quickly until they may
touch 1 to 2. Brltt will have a large
following, while Xelson, being a com
parative stranger here, will be backed
chiefly by those who like a Ion* shot.

Levy Beats Rna@ and Young . Kroger
Takes Two Straight Games
From Stratford.
The court of the Olympic Club,
where the soft handball tournament

did the winner.

, In America.MONSTER LINER REACHES PORT
Minnesota a Giant Ship of Great Capacity, and Many Comforts
The Great Xorthem Railroad Com- 1
pany's new liner Minnesota arrived
yesterday morning from the Atlantic.
After a brief detention in quarantine
she steamed up the bay and dropped
anchor off the Union Iron Works. The
Ventura. Sonoma and Sierra have ac
customed the people of this port to
passenger liners of large size, and from
the Korea, Siberia, Mongolia and Man
churia people have learned something
of the superlative degree in modern
passenger carrying freighters. But the
Srinnesota is in a class by herself.
She lacks the speed of some of the big
steamships familiar in these waters,
but in every other respect overtops her
floating sisters as the battleship towers
above the torpedo-boat. She is the big
gest steamship flying the American
Hag. As becomes the newest of Yankee
liners, the has borrowed from the
school of scientific achievement all the
latest ingenuities. She is comfprtable
as soft carpets, broad decks, elevators,
electric heaters, luxurious upholstery
and perfect ventilation can make her.
She could be rammed through and
through in half a dozen places and still
float; cut in two, and each section
would remain on the surface. She is
practically unsinkable.
As a floating: hotel she has no equal
on the Pacific, and the burden of fifteen
miles of freight cars can be stowed
away in her holds.
She is said to have cost more than
52.000.000. and she looks like the price.
She ib C30 feet long:. 75:6 feet beam and
56:1 l>et deep. Her gross tonnage is
20,718. Her cargo capacity is 27.9S2 cu
bic tons. Her total capacity, including
bunkers, is 22,221 tons. When carrying
23,800 tons dead weight the Minnesota
draws thirty-eight feet of water. She
has accommodations for 250 first cabin
passengerg. 6S. intermediate passengers
and 1424 steerage or 1224 troops.
Electricity is the slave which works
moja of the wonders of the Minnesota's
marvelcus internal ecoonomy. There
is an electric heater and a telephone
in every stateroom. The central tele
phone.office, where there will be an op
erator alwaj's on duty. Is one of the
show places of the ship. Passengers in
their rooms can telephone to any de
partment of the ship or can talk over
the wire to any other passenger. The
electric heaters can be shut off or regu
lated by the occupants of the state
rooms by the simple process of turning
a button.
The cooking is all done away down
below, out of Eight, sound and smell
of the passengers. The prepaivd food
is carried by noiseless elevators, or
dumb waiters, from the lower regions
to the dining saloon, where undumb
servitors will distribute It in orthodox
style three times a day. For the bene
fit of eccentric or abnormal appetites
a buffet is maintained in another part
of the ship, where anything from a full
meitl to a sandwich will be served day
or night.
The saloon, around the tables of
which are 1SS comfortable leather-seat
ed chairs. Is handsomely furnished and
artistically lighted. There Is a dainty
ladies' parlor, a well-stocked library
and a smoking-room. In which the most
â¢worried man in the world could forget
his troubles and imagine himself J. J.
Hill without the railroad magnate's re
sponsibilities.
The handling of cargo will bring lit
tle discomfort to the passengers, as all
the work will be done by thirty-six
noiseless electric winches. The Minne
sota, has nine' pairs of hatches, and in
the forest of cargo booms is one capa
ble of lifting a forty-five ton burden
from the wharf and lowering it swiftly,
gently and without noise to the most
remote corner of the deepest hold.
There are electrical devices in every
part of the ship. In the galley are elec
tric broilers, electric dough mixers,
â¢electric plates for the making of hot
cakes. In the pilot-house it is electricity
that blows the whistle, electricity that
operates the steering gear, that carries
messages from bridge to engine-room
and other parts of the ship. In the
pilot-house is an electric clock, which
takes charge of the fog signai in thick
weather, and another electric device
which stands guard over the electric
lamps which constitute the side lights
and other law-required illumination. If
one of these lights goes out a bright
lamp glows in the pilot-house and a
bell begins to ring. The lamp glows
end the bell rings until the extin
ruished light is again in commission.
One of the Minnesota's glories Is the
breadth of her clean, white decks. At
the forward end of the bridge deck is
one clear space, 30 by 75 feet, room for
a dozen sets of lancers or for the drill
ing of a battalion of infantry.
The Minnesota's bridge, as she is
now loaded, is sixty-five feet above the
water line. Her smoke stack has a
diameter of nineteen feet fore and aft
by sixteen feet across. She has twin,
triple expansion engines of 10,000 horse
power. She has two thirty-eight-ton
refrigerating machines and sixteen
Niclausse water tube boilers. She is
fitted with a longitudinal bulkhead,
running the entire length of the ship,
has twelve water-tight bulkheads and
twenty-four compartments and a
double bottom which is used for water
ballast and is divided into twenty-two
compartments.
Traveling at fourteen knots per hour
the Minnesota burns 160 tons of coal
in twenty-four hours. On her trial trip
she developed a speed of sixteen knots.
The Minnesota is commanded by
Captain John Truebridge and her oth
er officers are: Chief engineer, George
Allan; chief officer. J. F. Blaine; first
officer. W. S. P. Keyes; second officer,
P. C. Grening, and third officer, John
Duffy.
The Minnesota encountered fine
weather all the way from the Atlantic,
the liner's size impressing even Cape
Horn into keeping the elements in that
neighborhood in order. There was
>ome trouble with the crew whom
Captain Truebridge describes as the
hardest '-roivd he ever went to sea
with.- One of the sailors had a fight
â on the bridge with the second and
E^'rd officers and several of the men
nt varytos spells in irons as a pen
â  w^j* for refusing duty.
ThÂ« Minnesota has 3000 tons of coal
for this port which will be discharged
into lighters. She will not come along
side any whsrf during her stay here.

There's Only One Way to
Get the Best -of Whisky
And that la to let It alone. If you try
any other way lt will get the best of!
you. If you can't let it alone you need
Dr. McKanna's treatment. Dr. McKan-
na cures the liquor habit by destroying
the desire for liquor and putting the
system In its natural condition, wher*
liquor is not needed to help the machin*
ery of the body to do its work. Dr.
McKanna effects a complete cure in threÂ»
days without the use of dangerous hy-
podermics, annoying confinement or bad
after effects. Dr. McKanna's treatment
Is absolutely safe and cannot harm ths
most delicate constitution. Why waste
time and money In drinking whisky
when you can be cured of the liquor
habit In three days with.no chance oÂ£
failure, no risk and no unpleasantness?
Think lt over and call or write Dr. Mc-
Kanna for full Information. Address 14

"HE SAVED MY LIFE" LAST WEEK.â
Through eating tainted meat I suffered the
most awful, excrutlating torments from
PTOMAINE POISONING. Every moment
seemad as if It would be my LAST. I
writhed in exquisite anguish all the time.
There was constant violent vomiting and
purging with inconceivable. Intolerable tor-
ture all over my body especially In stom-
ach and bowels. I felt I must surely DIE
unless speedily helped, but nothing relieved
me In the least. I was collapsing from the
most cruel agonies and exhaustion. Then
came Rexradlo, whose "flrst" treatment (In-
stantly) gave me extraordinary relief. It was
like passing from hell to heaven. The second
treatment fully and permanently stopped ail
the dreadful pains, vomiting and purging,
with no return since. That night I slept
soundly and ever since have felt like a new
man, entirely painless, easy and hearty, and
able as usual to attend to my business. 1
cannot speak too highly of Rexradlo and his
truly "marvelous" humanized radium treat-
ment, which I earnestly recommend to all
sufferers. Before I was a "skeptic," but now
Rsxradlo has not a more enthusiastic, grate-
ful advocate than I am. He healed me as
If by magic, and undoubtedly saved my
life.. Call on me any time. â Richard J.

BLOODHOUNDS ON TRAIL
Fugitives Take Refuge in I
the Wilds of No Man's
Land Near St. Cloud
Special Dispatch to The Call,
ST. CLOUD, Minn., Dec. 14.âProfes
sional burglars made a raid on the
bank of Rice, near this place, and ob
tained $22,000 in money, valuables and
negotiable paper. The drilling and
blowing up' of the safe were accom
plished without interruption Just be
fore dawn to-day, but the heavy door,
in falling, crushed the flooring in the
vault room and attracted the attention
of the cashier, William Fosmett, who
lives next door to the bank.
Fosmett hurried into the disordered
room and was met by the burglars,
who held him up at the muzzles of
their revolvers and made him enter
the large vault where the records of
the institution were kept. ' Then they
shut the door and departed. They
stole a team and drove In the direc
tion of St. Cloud. The team was found
about five miles from this city this
morning and traces left by the men
were plainly to be seen leading off
toward No Man's Land, in the river
bottoms. A pack of bloodhounds from
the State penitentiary was obtained
and the chase followed across the bush
country. *
To-night three suspicious characters
were arrested here, but Fosmett was
unable to identify any of them.

Since the Government placed the Fortune at
the occasional disposal of the naval militia
men there has been a marked improvement in
the work of the class, which will soon be fit

they will be qualified, say their instructors, to
do any of the work involved In navigating
any kind of vessel to any part of the world.

Stocks and Cotton.
The $Â«w York wires of E. F. Hutton & Co.
j-esteniay said:
STOCKS â The market mad* considerable
â¢progress In straightening Itself out from the
rÂ«>oeot disturbance and breaking away from I
th* Influence of the bear attacks of the Boston
speculator asd the local clique which has
been operating in conjunction with this in
terest. It still showed, however, considerable
lrrerulafitT and toward the close ran up. in
dicating its sensitive condition and that we
*rÂ« likely to witness fre<juent sharp, reaction
ary moresneats before the market finally cft
;".es down and confidence la restored, and It
<i acala la a. position to make a substantial
upturn and hold the Improvement.
COTTON â It seems to us tiist the market
â haa bÂ«en pressed to where Bupport will bÂ«
f:ves unless tie consvmera axe the masters
of the ettuatics!. We have no doubt but the
Tneetlag ot the boll weevil convention at New j
Orleans will be Instrumental In causing farm
ers to hold their cotton for higher .prices.
AThile the exports aiw large it is claimed that
they will be still larger la the next two
â¢weeks, as they are heavily committed for
December ehtsraents.
Wall Street View.
The New York circular of Henry Clews gives
the foilowlca; causes of the recent break In
etocka. It will be observed that while It gives
Lawson's attack on Amalgamated Copper as
the direct cause of the emash. it Intimates
that It would have occurred sooner or later
without the Initiative of the Boston operator:
Like '"a bolt from the blue" the crash in
Wall street came when least expected ani
when all seemed serene. The truth !s, the
market .was rii>e for a break. For weeks and
mcatiis stocks continued to rise without in
terruption until speculation, orverstimulated by
increasingly favorable outside conditions, car
ried the market up to the point of collapÂ«e.
ITi'intimit everywhere was so overwhelmingly
bullish that weak spots were Ignored and a
eliuatlon created where only a shock of some
*ort was needed to force wholesale liquidation.
This shocks came in the form of an attack
upon Amalgamated Copper, which promptly ex
posed the weakened condition" of the whole
market. Stocks, it wae then seen, had passed
from strong Into weak hand*. The big men
tvhÂ» bought freely at the low prices of 1903
had' disposed very largely of their holdings,
and whea the crash came there was little or
n<? eurport from this quarter. Liquidation of
overbought accounts became imperative and
prices were so high that no substantial buyers
could be found except at euch heavy declines
ff exhausted weak margins and frightened
timid holders -out of their senses. The decline
wan. of course, accompanied by the usual eup
p!y of unsettling rumors and intensified by the
trading element who always push a movement
In pltner direction to the utmost. One thing is
Clear: ttrt â Cfiaccial atmofphrre fcas been much
clarified bjf this unwelccme squall. Values are
now on a more substantial ba.Â«ls â¢ and weak
ppots have been prptty thoroughly eliminated.
A r*riod of irregularity may follow euch a
j>hock. but speculation SÂ» likely to be carried
on within eafer ar.d narrower limits, and the
so-called "boom" has. received a timely and
much-n*eded check. Conservative bankers had
for come time been apprehensive ot excesses

New York Stock Market.
NETS' YORK. Dec. 14. â Another etep t was
tak*n toward the establishment of a normal
ttoek market to-day after the paroxirmal state
e>t thÂ» dealings. The effect yesterday of. the
support which was forthcoming to protect the
market from a further disastrous fall led to a
Ustless movement to corer shorts on the part of
a retreating bear party. There was traceable
ecme reauir^jtlon of operations on the long side
a* well, and a renewal of efforts to push prices
up rapidly to close the raps in price* caused
the fall. But it developed in the course of
the day that conditions were not "favorable to
this rapid return to the speculative mood ex
tstlnjf before the break in the market. The de
mand rapidly thinned out at the higher level
and there was some pressure to Hell at the re
covered price*. Toward the end of the day
tbÂ« market sunk Into .a dull and liFtless ctate
â¢not far from las* nlghfs close. There vsfiu
nothing in the circumstances of the day to
account either for the morning advance Â©r
thp afternoon reaction further than the natural
tendency of the market to readjust itself by a
â¢Ties of lessening fluctuations after such a
<~nmmctlon as that to'Ti-faich It had been smb
}<XTÂ«!d.
T!ie Advance in Amalgamated Copper was a
material aid to the general recovery and Its
yielding was the eignal for the abandonment
*>f operations for the rise. The attempt to
tno\> prices 1 upward entered conspicuously in
the coaler*, and thiÂ» group had the tp*clal ad
vanfapp ef the active demand for coal stimu
lated by the wintry weather. Advances In a
r.umber of stocks In the group extended to 2
"o. 2% points. Atchison was the most con
ppicuoti* Â«>ak fepet in the market. During the
TTlod. of etrength in the general market It was
raÂ»rÂ»:]y a laggard, but â with the reaction It
yielded sharply. The detlslon to issue $50.
<W),<M)0 of convertible bonds to provide capital
for exteneions end abeorptiens vai the evident
cause of the disfavor with which the stock
Â«-a* viewed in the day'e speculation. Its drop
to 3 points Mow lart night in the late mar
â¢tst. perhap* helped to drag flown the rent of
the.liet. The addition of Jl,*5O0.000 In gold
coin to thÂ«> engagements of all the available
rold ben. for export had an unfavorable nentl
mental effect. The further . rise In the ex
change rcte made the gold outgo more easily
explicablp. but the fart that th<> shipment Is to
he made on a Â«lrw freight steamer without re-
RSirt to tlw added interest charge for the
longT trant-lt keeps the movement In an anom
ainus situation.
The money market was not affected in any
of-i-rw and. in fact, was iÂ«enÂ»!b]y easier both
Or <-Â«!! BTirt time loan*. San Francisco con
tinues Jo make large rÂ»><julslt!ons on New Tork

CHICAGO, Dec. 14.â The wheat market was
firm from the start. Sentiment at the open

tone on foreign grain markets. The'-'initial
price for May was %c. lower to %c higher at
Â»1 08?i@l 09. All signs of bearlshness how
ever, ' were quickly., dispelled by. a decided
decrease in Northwestern receipts. Rumors
of a continued light movement were partially
cfinflrined through falrlyr. active buying -of
wheat ' here 'by cflTnmlssion- houses at North
western centers. The demand from that quar
ter started covering by shorts. ;- Little; selling
pressure being apparent the price became more
bullish as'the sÂ«Â»slon progressed. Strength of
the cash marketi* at-Duhith and Mlnneapolia
formed an additional Influence In speculative
trading here late in the session. - May -reached

*, "The circular -of-. Somers'"&: Co. says: '., ' 'â â 
I ,"Rec?lpts of. Hay have been very , heavy dur
ing the past' weÂ«k." the- total. showing 37Ctt tons
which 'Is â  the 1- heaviest" amount ; for: the"'pist\
three . months. In .: consequence of ' such â¢ free
arrivals the market has weakened somewhat.
Most everything that is being marketed waÂ«
purchased by different Hay dealers during the"
summer, and rather than make any loss on.
their purchases they seem Inclined to with
draw them from the market and store them In
'their own. warehouses here in town. From
what we can learn many orders for shipment
have been canceled, so that during the next
two or three weeks It Is very reasonable to
expect light shipments of Hay. As a ru'.e we ,
experience a rather quiet demand during the
holiday season., so we anticipate a very un
interesting state of affairs here until. after the
first qf the â  year.
"Crop prospects 1 are very encouraging. - bc
that no apprehension need be felt in that di
rection at present. From all appearances the
only thing that can help our market is some
unprecedented demand, and it seems as though
something might materialize In this line
shortly. . Inquiries for lots of Hay ranging
from 2000 to 5000 tons for shipment to the
Orient have been circulated throughout this
market during the past .week, and the inquiry
has been so general that we are compelled to
believe that there must be some need for our
Hay. either for the Japanese or the Russians.
Should cither nation become purchasers in the
San Francisco market the situation may be
I greatly improved here, especially as the, United
Estates Government will receive bids shoitly
for tiSOOtons for shipment to Manila."

JUST A LITTLE
WAR OF WORDS
Attorney Treadwell Answers
Lawyer Fitzgerald in the
Contra Costa Water Matter
ATTACKS THE PLEADING
Counsel "Thanks Heaven"
That He Doesn't Know
Anything About Oakland
R. M. Fitxgsrald, counsel fof the city
of Oakland In the suit brought by the
Contra. Costa Water Company, was
moved yesterday to make a rejoinder
to certain remarks of W. B. Treadwell
of the counsel for the water company,
who was attacking * the validity, and
sufficiency- of tbe city's answer. . â¢
Mr. Fitzgerald said that the case had
been turned over from one lawyer to
another attorney who knew nothing
about the case except what' he â ' had
seen in the papers filed in court, "and
he Jumps all over the case ignoring the
citations of authorities that we have
made," he added. "We insist; that these
answers are full-and sufficient."
Mr. Treadwell made the facetious re
ply: "In one respect the counsel is un
doubtedly right, and -that is when he
says that-I-don'*.-know-aÂ«ythlng about
the case except what I saw in the pa
pers on file. It is true that that is
all I know about it, and that is all
that the master in chancery Is permit
ted to know about it. The gentlemen
on the opposite side seem to know a
good deal about the case from their
inner consciousness and. from conver
sations which they have had with cÂ«*e
another, but, unfortunately for them,
this case is not going to be decided by
those things. It is true, also, that I
don't know anything about Oakland,
and I thank heaven that I don't."
After this gentle sidewinder Mr.
Treadwoll resumed his argument to
Ehow Master in Chancery Heacock
that the answers filed by the city
should be stricken out for insufficiency.

S WINDLERS TWO
COME TO GRIEF
Held to Answer 1for Working
AmtflqiLiie Half I interest Game
THEIR VICTIMS ARE SIX IN NUMBER
From the testimony adduced in the
prosecution of H. E. .Whitehouse and
J. S. Strasburg, accused of obtaining
money by false pretense, and commit
ted to the Superior Court by Police
Judge Fritz, It appeared that their de
vice for entrapping unsophisticated in
vestment-seekers was reflective of both
ingenuity in the planning, and audacity
in the operation. - It . consisted of a
stereopticon advertising screen that
nightly commanded the attention of
persons passing No. 722 Market, street,
and it was instrumental in separating
no less than six confiding ruralists
from $300 apiece before its manipulators
were arrested.
Among the victims of the scheme
was Herman SkilJman of San Jose, who
was induced to purchase a half-in
terest by Strasburg representing to
him that about $500 a month was
cleared from the advertisements dis
played, said representation being sup
ported by a display of contracts which
subsequently turned out to be bogus.
After his purchase Mr. Skillman as
cended to the roof of . the building
atop of which the- screen was stretched,
and thpre found Daniel Mack of Oro
ville, also asserting a proprietary in
terest in the enterprise. Mr. Skill
roan wanted to know what business
Mr. Mack had on the roof, and Mr.
Mack retorted by ordering Mr. Skill
rr.an to descend to the street. In the
language of both gentlemen while
testifying before Judge Fritz, "one
word borrowed another" and fistic
combat was imminent when Mr. Mack
averted it by producing the bill of sale
which entitled him to a half interest
in the screen and Its . appurtenaces.
When a similar document. was shown
by Mr. Skillman the fellow victims
shook hands and swore reprisal upon
their common deceivers. So they had
Messrs. Whitehouse and Strasburg ar
rested and charged as hereinbefore re
lated, and 1 the police succeeded in find
ing four other men each â¢ of whom
fondly imagined he owned one-half of
the proceeds of. the screen.
The defendants are on the best side
of thirty, and the police say that ere
their trial is called in the upper court
the prosecution will have heard from
several other counties.
Resultant of a special order 'Issued
by the Chief of Police to his patrolmen
there were on each of the four calen
dars several cases in which the charge
was that of expectorating upon the
sidewalk, and by strange coincidence
each of the four prosecuting attorneys
remarked that men who expectorate fn
public places ..cannot expect to rate as
gentlemen. - Some of tne, defendants
were dismissed and others were given
twenty-four . hours' imprisonment. It
is understood that the anti-splttlng
crusade was inaugurated in compliance
with . request of the Outdoor Art
League, ) an ' organization of public
spirited ladies whose aim is the beauti
ficatlon .of >San Francisco's streets.

BY JA3IES C. CRAWFORD.
Frank McCormick and "Will Jam. "White
were remanded to the Superior Court
by Judge Conlan, with bail in each
case set at $1000.
â¢ a â¢
Ed La 'Pierre, accused of pilfering
towels from the Hotel Lanpham, ex
plained that he was not a "bell-hop,"
as alleged by the prosecuting police
man, but an elevator boy, and then
Judge . Cabaniss, in consideration of
the youth having had so many ups and
downs, fined him $20 instead of send
ing him to Jail 'for "petty larceny. It
was a great day for jokes.
Minnie Parfltt, accused of cobbing
Peter Koulourites of $35 at or about 2
o'clock last Sunday morning in his
apartment at 827 Howard street, pro
fessed ability to prove an alibi if she
were permitted to summon witnesses,
who would incidentally testify to the
excellence of her character. At the
time., .of the alleged robbery, she
averred, a gentleman was swinging her
through the intricacies of the "bunny
two-step" in a Pacific street dance hall,
whereof .she is the acknowledged stellar
attraction. This could be proved, she
said, if the court would subpena Miss
May Vernon, one of her Terpsichorean
associates; Leo, the accordionist; Lar
sen, the floor manager, and Billy, the
barkeep. Judge Mogan ordered that
subpenas issue as suggested.
Miss Parfitt's male . consort, regis
tered as Bob Parfltt, was arrested for
vagrancy, and the court is considering
his claim that he is a professional
washer of carriages. i
Katie Synfy, the terrible Turk who
.resisted arrest for fast driving, was
fined $50 by Judge Conlan, and in de
fault of paying the same was sent to
jail for as ' many days. Mr. Syrlfy's
belligerency had wilted under the in
fluence of prison fare and confinement,
and he was personified meekness when
his sentence was pronounced.
Sadie Williams, 17 years of age and
very pretty, was charged with incorri
gibility by her mother, a comely ma
tron, whose physical charms were en
hanced in .effectiveness by stylish and
costly .apparel. . She informed.. Judge
Fritz that > the girl evidently preferred
loitering on the Barbary Coast : to en-
Joying . the comforts â , of â¢ an excellent
home and deriving the; benefits of ma
ternal example and precept. . No, she
did not desire to have the wayward one
sent to a reformatory, but would like
to have the court' compel her to go to
work in a. factory.
, "May I ask," remarked the Judge,
eying the complainant's garb, "how
you obtain a livelihood?"
"Indeed, you may," was the smiling
response. "I have wealthy relatives , in
Humboldt County."
"And their bounty supports you?"
"Well, I might as well tell you that
I have a husband, Mn Folsom, a barber
by trade and Sadie's stepfather, and
I'm sure he's just as eager as I am that
she should go to work." '
'"From what you tell me," said his
Honor, "I don't think It would be ex
actly just to force this young girl, to
earn her living in a factory. - Why
don't you send her to your wealthy rela
tives in- Humboldt County? Don't you
think there would be a better chance
of reforming her character in the coun
try than in a factory? '
.Mrs. Folsom meditatively surveyed
her. patent leather shoetlps ere she ac
quiesced. Then the . Judge continued
the case until next Wednesday, advis
ing the mater to communicate with her
opulent relatives in the meantime.
Frank Gullixson and Joshua ,Kap
kin, neither of whom has attained
man's estate, were . charged before
Judge Cabanlss With robbing Henry
Dunbar, residing at 24 Fourth'street,
of, $300 last Tuesday night in the no
torious Midway Plaisance . on Market
street. There was little or no I evi
dence to sustain the complaint, how
ever, and Prosecuting Attorney Han
ley after requesting Judge Cabanlss to
order a dismissal announced his inten
tion to notify the Police Commission
of the fact that boys of tender years
were . permitted to â  frequent the Mid
way Plaisance and - that the liquor
license held" by the proprietor thereof
should be revoked.- So the two lads
were discharged: and reprimanded for
spending their nights in. sinful places.
Miss Belle Benton, tall and cos
tumed with academic plainness, was
fined $10 for selling a drink of whisky
to a disguised policeman who visited
her unlicensed refectory in a Mason
street apartment house. .Another
woman, who was, arrested at the same
time and place and -booked" on the
same charge', obtained a dismissal,
and .Miss Benton might "have : been
similarly. treated if she had not haunt
ed- the court corridor, and' boastfully
hinted | that ' her acquittal was ' as â¢ good

hotel to visit a woman relative 'who is
employed there, and inasmuch as his
presence was in violation of the rules
of the Waldorf ," he ran away and did
not wait to render assistance. Because
of the trouble that he -might occasion
the woman he went to call on, Armand
explains, ha" was reluctant to ; come
forward with his testimony, although
he was the only person who, as he
claims, was a witness to the fatality.
It is by no means certain that Judge
Coffey will admit Armand's deposition
at this late day. . Counsel are expected
to have another of their keen' disputes
on the law of evidence when the "docu
ment is offered. In any event this
deposition is all that stands in the way
of the final struggle before the Jury,
when" counsel will loose tongues in
combat for the stakes in a $1,000,000
estate.
"We shall not want more than two
hours for argument," . came the an
nouncement from proponents in" re
sponse to a query from Judge Coffey.
"I shall open and close/: but I have
been in such confusion with my work
that I am: unable to say now how
much time I shall want," said Hiram
Johnson. "I promise not to be a bore,"
he added. â¢
McEnerney declared that no such as
surance was" necessary, and this was
the first note of good nature in the
day's proceedings.
ICTHELi ROCHE MAKES DENIAL.
The proponents had announced the
close of their case early in. the.morn
ing session, after the cross-examina
tion of William W. Carson, during
which nothing important was de
veloped, was en(Jed. Johnson recalled
Miss Ethel Roche for cross-examina
tion and asked her if she had not made
statements to Rachel Schander, daugh
ter of the contestant, to the effect that
Bertha . Dolbeer was "restless," and
had been very ill while in Paris the last
few weeks of her life, r The witness
made denial. â : â¢
The attorneys began to enliven
things as soon as the contestant
opened his case in rebuttal. ;
"Call Miss Etta Marlon Warren,"
spoke up Johnson in. stentorian tone.
But the chief beneficiary, whose right
to bequests aggregating $800,000 or
more is to be decided by jury,
was not in court. MdEnerney ex
plained that she had gone home ill the
day before, but that she would be on
hand at 2 o'clock.
Johnson then called Arthur H. Ba
rendt, who testified that William G.
Mug-an told him on the night the news
of Miss Dolbeer's death was- received
in San Francisco that he feared it was'
"too true" that she had lost her mind,
as intimated in the dispatches. Mugan
had denied on the stand that he made
the remark to the reporter.
The contestant next sought to intro
duce the deposition of Theodore V S.
Rumney.- office manager for Laidlaw &
Co. in New. York, where. Miss Dolbeer
drew $800 against a letter of credit the
morning of the day of her death. Coun
sel-had been growing more and more
argumentative, but their talents were
brought into. full play as to the admis
sibility of the deposition. Each side
had â  taken â  Rumney's itestimony. The
contestant did not present in his case
in qhlef, and proponents^ contended
that he could not be allowed now to
have it read in rebuttal; nor could he
have 'his case reopened, for the deposi
tion was available when he was mak
ing out his case. ' '
Johnson replied .that he had reason
ably expected that proponents would
ment and when the $10
fine : was imposed, nor did she. seem to
be solaced. by the court's remark that
she might consider herself fortunate
in getting off so cheaply.

produce thÂ©/-testlmony, and now that
they had failed to do ho he thought.
he. was' entitled to have it read either,
in rebuttal or as a part of his Â«.'ase.
Judge Coffey had dlemlUMfid the Jury
while*. he heard the heated argument*!
for fear things might be ualrt to fnflu,
ence the members unwarrantably. He
has. been curbing the attorneys
throughout the trial, but for the sake
of variety, apparently, he allowed them
one good round of urging and wordy
contention. His ruling was for the pro
ponents, and the deposition waa shut
out. â¢ : ,
, On the opening of court in the after
noon Miss Warren was- in attendance,'
accompanied by her nurse. D. F. Mul
lender- was .first called. . however, to
show that the photograph of Mlas Dol
beer, which had been exhibited to the
Jury, was taken in March, 1899, long
before she began to, develop melan
cholia, gs contended by contestant. .
Frederick S. Moody, son of Mrs. J.
L. Moody, the aunt of the testatrix,
who has allied herself with contestant,
was placed on the stand to -contradict
Douglas Sloane Watson's denials. The
witness â¢ declared . it was true that
shortly after the death of Miss Dolbeer
Watson- remarked that she "unques
tionably committed suicide." Watson
had also made a number, of. statements
concerning the will, the witness assert
ed. Watson denied having made them
when quoted to him while he was oir
the stand' early in the trial.
RACHEL SCHANDER CALLED.
Rachel Schander, a very pretty miss
of 17 years, whose father is seeking be
tween $300,000 and $400,000 by his con
test of the will, declared that Miss
Roche, her cousin, was at fault -when
earlier In the day she denied having
said to witness that Bertha Dolbeer
was "restless" and had been "very 111"
during her last stay in Paris.
; The attempt of the contestant to
make a witness of Miss Warren proved
unsuccessful. She took her place calm
ly, in the witness chair, but not a word
did she utter other than her name,
which Judge Coffey asked for. The ob
jection to every question- that Johnson
propounded was sustained. Again' Mc-
Enerney pointed out that she should
have been called when . the contestant
was presenting his case at the begin
ning of the .trial. . Furthermore, her
deposition had been taken and knowl
edge of her testimony was at all times
in the possession of opponents. John
son Insisted that he had reasonable
ground to believe that the proponents
would, call her to the stand, and their
having failed to do so gave him the
right to t make her a^ witness for the
contestant. The attorney made a num
ber of declarations that all he was
seeking was the truth, and he made a
number of disparaging comments con
cerning the desire of proponents "to
hide and conceal the facts." Counsel
were in continuous conflict.' 1
Johnson asked a number of questions
as to whether or not Miss Dolbeer was
not despondent and suffering from neu
resthenia and -other, symptoms, of in
sanity while she was in Paris, but the
objections were sustained one after an
other. He concluded by asking permis
sion to. reopen his case, but was re
fused. Then he sought to introduce her
deposition, but this request was also
denied. This closed the clever effort of
the contestant to make his' principal
adversary a witness in his own behalf.
