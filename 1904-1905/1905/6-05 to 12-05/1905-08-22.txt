reiterate that Resident \u25a0 Roosevelt under

soon as he had himself read, made
public the findings of the court of
inquiry -tfhich investigated the explo
sion on the gunboat Bennington at .San
Diego. Cal., on July 21. The findings
were a complete surprise, for they at
once set at rest theories that had been
circulated that the Bennlngton's boiler
and perhaps those of other. naval ves
sels o* the same age were defective.
AÂ« a matter of fact the court found
the explosion resulted from the closing
of a valve which connected the ex
ploded boiler with Its rteim sauge mo
that the pressure <m tne boiler may
Imve been Â»everal hundred pounds to
the square Inch when the accident oc
curred.

There Is reason to believe that the Idea
that Japan might not* be able to find
money \u25a0to continue the war nas not been
considered here a3 a serious weakness of
the Japanese position.
ST.- PETERSBURG, Aug. 22.â The Rus
sian Government's final statements to Do
Wltte, outlining: the course that he shall
pursue at the reopening of the peace con
ference at Portsmouth, are still In pro^
cess of being put Into cipher, prior to be
ing forwarded to America. With the re
ceipt -of St. Petersburg's last message
the brief breathing spell will have ended.
St.' Petersburg leaves the final word with
her representative ' at Portsmouth.
. When the . nature of these communica
tions'.becomes generally . known it will be
seen that,* In a sincere desire to effect a
satisfactory settlement, the Government'
has 'gone as far as its extremely vital
state Interests will permit.' It can be
further" said' that, for this reason, the
Government is firmly convinced that in
case of failure of the negotiations the re
sponsibility will not rest with Russia,,
which has conceded much already. While
it is Impossible to learn the actual con- \u25a0
tents of the Government's communication
to De; Wltte,. It can be declared that the
requirements ; of the state make conces
sions on the questions of Indemnity and
Saghalien, 'as those questions were orig
inally presented by the Japanese, im
possible. . .
It Is certain that in the matter of con
cessions .the four points now in dispute
have been considered . and studied in : the
light- of .'concessions ' Russia already has
granted on the other eight articles. .
The f foregoing , Is a'\u25a0 brief, j but accurate,
outline ,of -, the . platform upon which Do
Wltte-' will* meet me Japanese plenipoten
tiaries > to-day.. \u0084, Â«
â¢ Baron. Rosen's reports. regarding his in
terview | with President . Roosevelt have
been received : here; and . their] perusal by
the Government has only increased their
feeling of gratitude . and appreciation * for
President Roosevelt's continued efforts.
Baron Rosen's" communications to the
Emperor â¢ are ' such as do not require a
special answer.'/ . â¢, y ': \u25a0\u25a0
\u25a0\u25a0 A' .hopeful J feeling was especially no
ticed -here yesterday that .peace was still
possible,' and it is 'believed by some that
Russia's . answer will give material evi
dence of such a sincere desire , to reach
a settlement that Japan practically will
be forced to accept it or appear â¢ before
the world as utterly unreasonable and
insatiable.
It is -believed, that the question of the
surrender of interned ships and the limi
tation of Russia's naval power in the
Far East will be satisfactorily settled.
There then remain " the question of the
payment of indemnity and the cession of
Saghalien by Russia. The first may bo
overcome by Russia following Japan*3
lead in avoiding the use of the word "in
demnity," but consenting to make certain
payments to Japan on other scores, the
chief of these being Japan's bill for keep
ing 100,000 prisoners, which is expected to
be . very heavy. The sums mentioned as
t^e possible payment on account of these
prisoners range from $30,000,000 to $159,
000,000. Little or nothing is obtainable
here regarding the possisle disposition
of the question relating to Saghalien.
'Interest has been manifested lately in
the attitude of the Japanese people, and,
it is recognized in some quarters that the
Japanese Government "and plenipotentia
ries may have to shape their course tq
meet and satisfy the demands voiced by
the Japanese public

the valve on tbe air cock alone, as was 1

to show; second, by the failure of the j

LONDON, Aug. 2Lâ That entertaining
French paper. . the Paris . Menestrel, has
just completed some researches among
the archives of the Querini family, of
which, it Is alleged, Shakespeare's Othello
was a member. A Venetian scholar, Ce
sare Augusto Levi, also has overhauled a
great bundle of documents relating to the
same -family -and claims to have discov
ered the original source whence "the great
dramatist derived the- plot of his rtragedy.
He- tells -all -about it In a communication
to the Institute Veneto. ~ /' ':''"
Although both investigators appear \u25a0 to
have had access to the same material,
their stories are very different. Accord
ing to the French paper, Desdemona's
tragic death really occurred in Crete, in
the year 1523. Othello had an accomplice
in- his valet, whom he instructed to place
himself, in. a chamber close to'^the lady's
apartments; and start groaning ?aa. though
something â¢ had. suddenly^ gone amiss with
him. Then Othello 'asked' his wiEe : to. get
up and learn what '"was "the- 1 matter. Â£ As
she -.crossed the threshold a eackfut-Vof
grass; was flung at her head,> She fall < to
the ground and was. then assailed with 'a
succession of similar.'gra^srnnejj sacks,
being finally smothered under the falling
celling and masonry, which had been
loosened by Othello's orders.-" This ver
sion makes Othello a regular low-down
villain. \u25a0-- '/*â¢/;
. .The Italian goes much more into de
tails..- He identifies Othello with.Nicoli
Qnerini, 'who had.fought hard for^the
Greek colonies of the republic of St.
Mark against Turkish corsairs, be
tween 1530 and 1540. He was 43 wjien
he married Palma Calerglâ the Desdef
mona of the* play â who was twenty
years his junior. They lived at Rethy
mo, in Crete. They did not get along
at all well together at first, j Signor
Lev! quotes letters from Antonio Caler
gl, Palma's cousin, describing how she
was cruelly beaten by her husband and
had to take sanctuary in the church of
San Francesco, whence she was carried
more dead than alive to her father's
home. He complained to the Venetian
Council of Ten -about his'son-in-Ugy's
conduct, and the latter was summoned
to Venice to be Â«tried on the charge of
conjugal cruelty. The ship on which'
he sailed to. Venice bore a' bundle of
letters from Antonio Calerglâ accord-
Ing to Signor Levl,: the original of
l agr o â to the Council of Ten._ The
Council acquitted Querini, who return
ed'to Crete and his wife. He treated
her much better thereafter, and they
both lived, to a v good old age in the
great Venetian island. It. is pleasant'
to learn, according to this version, that
Desdemona' was nevr really mur
dered. -' '- . ' - ;'â¢.
The announcement that the. old; ram-;
shackle house at Verona which,' accord-.
Ing to legend, was once the home of;Ju-/
liet, has been purchased by the town and
Is to be preserved as a museum,- simply,,
means that the town authorities are keen
to recognize an opportunity ; to,' extract
money from the pockets of the credulous.
The fact is there is no historical founda
tion for the story which the "great ! bard
has preserved for \ all times. Had â¢ there
bex n, Dante. , who re tired to j Verona when

Martial Law In Courland.
MITAU, Russia, Aug.. 21.â Martial
law has been declared throughout the
Baltic province of Courland.
The insignificant military forces which Rus
sia had in the island are another proof of
our sincere belief In peace. "We had not made
th.- least preparations for military operations,
either offensive or defensive. The few thou
sand soldiers who were there were chiefly ktrpt
jor th? purpose of guarding the 5000 convicts
who wÂ«r* kÂ«?i>t on the island and some ot
theÂ« soldiers were former convJctc who. after
having served their terms of penal servitude,
were allowed to enter a kind of militia.
This Russian authority denied that
the Japanese were prevented fishing in
the waters of Saghalien. He admitted
that they were submitted to certain
rules and restrictions, the object of
â¢which was to prevent the extermination
of the fish. But that was all. He con
tinued: ;
The development of the rewwrces by Russia
was planned as a consequence of the completion
of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. > Large profits
were expected from Its riches, as It contains
great-fluanime* of .coal. oil. timber. Iron and
other minerals. The chief resource, however,
thus far has b>-en its fisheries.
Liu> mse has thus fur-been made of thÂ«
Island. The population. Including the native*,
who belong to the Aino and Cuiliaks races, and
the exUes. most of whom after their terms of
servitude become eeui^nt. amounts altogether
to only 36.000 soulsâ that Js less than one to
\h* F<juarÂ» mile. Exploitation of the resources
of the Island has been hampered by the risor
Â«ius climate nnd lack of communications and It
la almost without roads and covered by almost
:Rar*eesMble torcsts.
Kusftlan Explahxs Why the Island Will
Sot Be Ceded to Japan.
PORTSMOUTH. N. H.. Aug. 21.â The
following statement from an authori
tative source . represents the Russian
view of the military and strategic value
of the island of -SagrhaUen:
To appreciate its -military value tt must be
borne in n.ind that the island, which is about
IXK) miles long, lies "almost against the main
land, being separated from it by the strait
of Tartary. which In some places is only lour
ml!es wide. Physically it might almost bÂ«
considered a Â«art of. the Asiatic continent. To
allow Â£aghall;n to pass into the hands of
JaiÂ«tn would be like America" allowing Long
Island or England allowing- the IslÂ« of Wight
to irtts into tht> possession of an ambitious
iorcl6n power. The danger from Saghalien
passing to Japan would Indeed be greater for
Uuseia than. . the loss of Lou? Island by
America, as .the length of LÂ»ong Island is
tcarcrly one-filth that of Saghalien.
There i* no doubt that whoever controls
Saghnlien, besides being in a position to threat
en and invade ihe Asiatic coast, would be
in a position to absolutely prevent communica
tion between tiwÂ» mainland and the Pacific,
through the Spa of Japan. It Is peculiarly adapt
ed lor offensive and defensive purposes. It could
easily be transferred into a formidable mili
tary and naval stronghold, from which expe
dition* might be launched and efficiently Â«up

Surrounded by a half-dozen newspa

NEWPORT, Aug. 21.â Miss Evelyn
Walsh.Had to go through the painful or
deal of having her fractured right thigh
set this afternoon.' Fortunately the
actual operation took only an instant, and
Miss Walsh continued to .- display the
bravery-she has shown since the automo
bile .accident on Saturday. The X-ray
photographs clearly showed a fracture of
the larger bone' of the thigh very near
the. hip joint. The plates also showed that
thev'unlon of "the two ri part3 had not been
exact," and the' operation rof to-day was
found to be necessary. ' The' reports that
she will be a permanent cripple, have been
a cause of 'grief Sto her \u25a0 family- and
friends, and are as far from the truth as
possible. â¢ ' "' 1

been informed: . ' '. ' >_.'.'., :
Mr. Walsh was almost in. a state.. of col

'friends to-night are concerned '"as" to his

As soon as Miss Walsh is able to be
moved and Mr. and Mrs. Walsh can leave
"they will go to Washington, where the
son's body will be buried in Rock Creek

Walsh will then go to Denver.
The last* words Vinson 'Walsh spoke

how It may be 'regarded by his imperial
toaster and the latter's advisers. It is a
mistake lo suppose that, in considering
fcuch a pro-position, the Emperor consults
a regularly ordained council. Throughout
the conference he has been cslhus in
counsel such advisers as he deemed wise
âsome of his relatives, the Grand Dukes,
members of the eouurt and certain chosen
Ministers. .. .
The Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaie
vitcli. one of the most powerful pf his rel
atives, is known to be absolutely opposed
to yielding an iota beyond what Mr.Â«de
Wltfe has already conceded. As analler
native. he favors the continuation of the
war. ,
The spirit of all the advices received
has been such as to preclude hope of an
eleventh-hour change. The general be
lief here :s that President Roosevelt, who
has the moral support of one of the neu
tral pewess, has not received the active
aid he expected. England's declination to
offer advice to Japan is disappointing, i
though the motives that actuate her In )
refusing to do anything that might be
construed as an attempt to exercise pres
ture upon hÂ«_r ally tending to rob her of
the fruits of her victory are fuily appie
cittd.
Tli;re are evidences here that co-opera
tion by Great Britain would have been
resented by Japan.
Ami ng the Japanese no note of hope is
sounded. With general reluctance, they j
teen: almost lesigned .to the shipwreck of I

- As a result of this almost universal out-,
cry against the system the whole method
of trial by jury has fallen into disrepute.
Many people , who j have been â¢ raised from
childhood .to. believe ithat. the. jury affords
"the only safeguard againstloppression and
tyranny are to-day/ at least as far as San
Francisco r is "concerned,-.' in /favor* of .the
abolishment of the jury altogether. Some 1
of the best lawyers in California and the
most learned- officials,- high- in trie-coun
cils of the State,": haveÂ«declared -that the
existing jury; systemi must be thoroughly
remodeled, i Others disagree: wlth ? . such
views, holding that' the jury system is the
chief guarantee -of -protection 1 against
despotism, and â¢' that whoever strikes a
blow at that- sacred institution assails the
very Integrity of the nation.
The- main- complaint^'is' against * San
Francisco.: The palpable reason of- this Is
that in only .two other counties of Cali
fornia is that law handled, as, it is in tnis
city. . No objection As made , to . the jury
law in itself, the failures which are justly
ascribed to its workings being due solely
to the manner In which iris administered
It is held tl'ut the fault lies with the.
Judges, rather than withjthe law. In all
tho counties of the State except three trial
jurors a re. selected by the Supervisors. In
the three exceptions the* -Judges chose
them. Prior to the adoption of the pres
ent Viiate constitution the district arid
other Judges made up the jury lists. Af
ter the adoption of the constitution in 1879
the section of the. code was amended, so
as to conform to the change in the judi
cial . system, providing that the lists
should bo made up by the. Judge's of the

Many members of the bar believe that

tor," they ; believe,' should be to remove
this power as | far as possible from the

YARDE-BULLER TRUST
NOT YET TERMINATED
Deceased Woman's Daugh
ter-in-Law Meets Defeat
in Court.
The Klondike and Jack London last
evening made their first appearance on
any stage with "The Great .Interroga
tion," a one-act play of Alaskan / life,
which Mr. London has dramatized from
one of his own stories in collaboration
with Lee Bascom. The play was. pro
duced at the Alcazar, and achieved a not
able success. It y was received -with
marked favor throughout, and at its close
the authors were discovered among the
aiidienceâ hidden in the wilds of the gal
leryâand a speech demanded. .Mr.-Lon
don bowed for the collaboration, but the
audience would not be denied." It clam
ored and waited until the novelist, in his
customary revolutionary garb, appeared
with Miss Bascom : before the footlights.
After thanks for his collaborater and
himself Mr. London gallantly credited the
lady with what" of merit the play pos
sesses. To her he said was owing- what
ever success it had earned. Of course a
facon de parler this, . and with due re
spect to Miss Bascom, the author of ..'A.
Bowery Girl" and other plays, the evi
dence points strongly the other way. The
situation, the characters, the local color,
Mr. London himself .has supplied.
Strength of situation, effectively con
trasted and firmly built characters, and a
novel and vivid local color are the strong
points oi the play. In stage craft if
lacks. There are longish speeches that
the experienced dramatist would have
broken, and there is here a literary rather
than colloquial flavor that he would have
ruthlessly translated. There is a confu
sion of motive in' the renunciation of the
chief figureâ the refusal to" leave the
squaw wife for the white womanâ that
notably weakens the coaracter. It is
perfectly human, but Imperfectly dramat
ic; richly suggestive from the literary
sue, i confusing only ' from the dramatic
viewpoint. â¢
David Payne, prospector, living with
his Indian wife-to-be in a lone cabin on
the Yukon, is tempted by the .woman; of
his own people whom he has loved to
leave the Indian. Payne refuses. Hating
the life, loving the woman, knowing what
the renunciation will cost, he still refuses.
Faith to the squaw who once saved his
life and who has been faithful handmaid
en to him ever 6ince at first seems to be
his only motive.- But there is another
developed, that, as before said, weakens
the situation. Karen -JSayther, the white
woman, Js a widow. Payne loved her in
the days before he came to Alaska. She
loved him, gave him reason to believe
that she would marry him, then threw
him over for a rich man, tlriven by the
needs of her family. Payne reminds her
of this, taunts her with it, tells her of
the faithfulness of the Indian and leaves
somewhat the impression that he desires
to make her suffer as she has once made
him suffer. It weakens the effect of -the
renunciationâ robs .the character of dra
matic solidity.
Nor is the end of_the play by one-,
half so effective as it^ should be. Al^
the characters remainiupbn the stage:'
the white -woman basrnot gone down
the Yukon; there is : between her and
Fayne only a cabin door, and the in
tended effect of the. white, man. left
alone with his grief In the "White Si
lence," is largely lost.
Doubtless .these things will shortly
settle themselves. The material of the
play Is splendidly vital, splendidly pic
turesque. In spite of theseâ and not a
few other faults of stagecraft â it held
the audience from beginning to end
last night, absorbed in its problem,
fascinated with its picturing of Alas
kan life and grateful for its fresh and
vital humor.
Besides Payne. Mrs. Sayther and the
Indian girl, there is another character,
of an old squaw, Kattou, excellently
conceived and acted in a classic fash
lon by Nera Ross. Mr. London and
Miss Bascom had good reason to be
grateful to their, interpreters .last
night, . and to the ; management, .which
gave the play, one of the most effective
settings recently seen here. Miss Cros
by as. the 'Indian ; girl was _as good
in that way as she was in . the Jap
anese way as Madame Butterfly. Her
make-up is startlingly effective and
her costume, reindeer skin and beads,
charming in the extreme.
White Whlttlesey as Payne,, though a
little tragically sentimental in liis recount
of the b'ar'flghtr made "otherwise- a virile
and - effective" figure, jj depicting .'con
siderable power the struggle betweenâbe
tween Just what?â anyway, the struggle.
Miss Eugenic Thais Lawton was the Mrs.
Sayther, and : showed : therein ;an em6
tional power, a depth and ' earnestness, v a
class distinction, that surprised \ even
those who best know this clever young
woman's work. Harry, von Meter seemed
to consider his: audience and ' associates
deaf In his attempt as Bill! Brown, and
Jlquel Lanoe cave a capital minute as
Pierre. â¢ '
No one will lose time in seeing "The
Great Interrogation," -which promises as
well for Mr. London's future as a drama
tist as his first stories'. promised for his
present fame therein.

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Edna Ursula Blair, widow of the late
Arthur K. Blair, haa been defeated in
her effort to secure possession of one
fourth of her deceased husband's one
half interest in the estate of his mother,
the late Mary L. Kirkham Blafr Yarde-
Buller. Judge Hebbard sustaintd a de
murrer yesterday to Edna Ursula
Blairs complaint, in which W. H.
Chapman, as trustee of the estate of
Mrs. Yarde-Buller, and Ralph X. . Blair,
surviving son of Mrs. Yarde-Buller,
were Joined as defendants.
On March 24, 1898. Mrs. Yarde-Buller
formed a trust by which she conevyed
her property to E. H. Wakeman for her
support during her life, the "property
to go upon her death to her two sons
or the survivor of them. In September
of 1900 Wakeman conveyed . the prop
erty to W. H. Chapman as trustee: -<
On March 21, 1903, the sons entered
into an agreernern. under the terms of
which Ralph K. Blair agreed to give
his brother's wife, a one-fourth interest'
is the brother's one-half interest should
his brother, Arthur,' die. But the il
legality of the original deed of trust
has. caused the whole structure upon
which Edna Ursula Blair based her
suit to fall. Judge Hebbard saying:
â¢ The agreement between Arthur, and Ralph Is
based upon the trust deed of March 24, 183s,
and- that-deed- is- absolutely- void so far as it
creates a trust to convey to Arthur K. and
Ralph K. Blair. The agreement therefore
must fall for want of subject matters.
Regarding the trust deed to Chap
man, to whom Wakeman made assign
ment, this deed bearing date of Janu
ary 7, 1901, the court continues: -
In the trust deed of January 7, 1901, Mrs
Yarde-Buller changed her trust to one for her
own maintenance during her lifetime and after
ward to the maintenance of her sons and the
survivors of them during, their lives. â¢ So It
seems the trust Is not yet terminated and will
not be until Ralph's death and then the residue
of the trust property Is to go to Mrs. Yarde-
Butler'n htlrs as directed in the deed. The
demurrer is sustained without leave .to amend.

Mng.
William Redmond is the son of the late
William Archer Redmond, who sat as the
Nationalist representative for the bor
ough of Wexford from 1572 till his death.,
In ISSO. William Redmond was born,' in
Wexford in ISSI. He received his educa
tion at the famous Jesuit College of Clon
gowes, near Dublin. He took his degree
of B. L. at Dublin University in 1891. He
was first elcc'.rd to Parliament In ISS3 as
member of the. borough of Wexford.
\u25a0When that borough was disfranchised in
18S5 under the redistribution cf seats bill
he was elected to represent North Ferma
nagh, for which he sat till the general
\u25a0 election of 1592, when he was elected for
East Clare, which he still represents.
Mr. Redmond has been a very active
member cf the Nationalist party in Par
liament. He is a fluent, forcible speaker,
and though he is not the finished orator
that his brother is. he can perhaps move
an audience as deeply.

breakfast or the lumpiness of the bed he
slept on the night before at the inn. Is
he is not utterly, unworthy of his, high

of contempt? So much ado about nothing

ticular territory will Involve the ex
penditure of a vast sum of money by
the contractors. Kennefick Is said to
possess valuable financial resources,

of the converts^ He said In conclusion:
Brethren, It Is coming. The reunion of Chris

rather to build /the character of those
\u25a0within the parish;' especially to care for
the children. "The 'work of character
building must be carried forward on
two linesâ first,, we, must develop .'the
individual, and second,; we must create

THOMAS TERRY LAID AT REST.
A" strong delegation representing. the
San Francisco" Keai Estate ; Board Will
go to v > Sacramento this afternoon for
the purpose of appearing to-morrow
before the State Board of Equalization
In opposition to any Increase *In the
assessments for taxation upon property
In San Francisco. Assessor Dotlge will
appear! at the same time; and place Jn
defense of the assessment for this city
and Interesting proceedings may safely
be anticipated; *'\u25a0 The < - San. ' Francisco
board is the first organized body to
stand in behalf of the' taxpayers of
San Francisco before the Board of
Equalization. Colonel Joslah Howell
will head- the delegation to Sacramento.
Some days ago a committee of the
State Board ot Equalization came to
San Francisco and was escorted by a
committee of the San Francisco Real
Estate Board and Assessor Dodge to all
sections of the city and assessments
were made clear for the benefit ' Of. the
equalizers. \u0084'... .s -
The principal -reason that San Fran
cisco has to expect that pressure will
be mado at Sacramento to have the
San Francisco assessment raised is the
reported attitude of Los Angeles, which
moved for a rais,e against San Fran
cisco two years ago, with the result
that an increase of \u25a030 j per cent was
added to this city's 'tax burden.
This year Los Angeles men have
been- inspecting the property In this
city and the supposition -Is that when
the Los Angeles -assessment Is taken
up to-day witnesses -"from Los Angeles
will try to increase the San Francisco
assessment again: The interest in trie
situation is Increased by the fact that
judges of value from: San Francisco
have visited Los Angeles within the
last few weeks and have made them
selves familiar with the property and
assessment of Los Angeles, T

STEANfIEES M THE QJTY
Their Family Connections
-.Not Known, but'Gne Is Said
to Have Sister in tlie South
The city does not ordinarily produce Its own
greatest men. but borrows them from the coun
try. From year to year tne strenuous activi
ties of the metropolis call upon the country
for "the beet we breed" and the farmers* sons
CO up to fill the high places and to direct the
monster tnduetrles of an acre of steam and
electricity. This condition, which appears to
be Inseparable from our civilization, will con
tinue as long; as we have a great, educated,
eelf -respecting and virtuous yeomanry to draw
upon, and It is threatened as soon as we have
â¢v disproportionate rapid crowth of . the urban
population and the subordination of j the rural
district*. In peace, as In war, the strength of
a nation Is In Its country-bred youth.
Now there Is nothing which holds out so
much hope of an Increase of country population
It it true that Florida end Louisiana, &Â«
mpttm their enamjÂ«, have round occasion for
the extensive and profitable practice or -Irriga
tion; but that 1b not true of New York, an!
Governor Hlgglns of the Empire Etate, recog
nizing- how large a stake the financial centers
have In the success ol the irrigation movement,
gladly took advantage of the opportunity to
came a list of Influential delegates. I hope
all these gentlemen are with us- to-day, and
that we shall hear from them often during the
proceedings. If there be such a thing. In the
true sense, as "high finance," It is the pro
motion of those - Industrial tendencies which
will create new wealth and f not merely absorb
Into fewer hands the wealth already existing.
The strength of the republic Is in its citi
zens, and the best nursery of citizenship is
the country home. We are proud of our great
cities with their wealth and luxury," but these
are purchased at a heavy cost, for wealth
and luxury can be enjoyea only by the few,
and the reverse side Is poverty, and squalor.
In the country poverty may exist, but It does
not mean squalor and It Is ' not Inconsistent
with social consideration. It was James G.
Elaine â & good citizen of the West, by the way
â who used the phrase "the sweet, clean pover
ty of the country" to make sharp the dlstlnc
Â« tion between the tendencies of the city and
X .hose of the country.

When Smith had concluded Governor
Pardee summarized the work before
the congress in his annual address. He
said in part:
GOVERNOR PARDEE SPEAKS.
Governor George C. Pardee of Cali
fornia, president of the congress, called
the convention to order. Governor
George E. Chamberlain welcomed the
congress to Oregon. Governor Cham
berlain: prefaced his welcome- by em
phasizing the Importance of irrigation.
He criticized severely the existing
laws, which he believed to be lacking
especially In conferring sufficient pow
er to condemn private property. Mayor
Harry Lane of Portland extended a.
cordial welcome in behalf of the city.
Governor Albert E. Mead of Wash
ington was the first of the visitors to
respond. He made a brief address in
favor of Irrigation. %
Congressman J. H. Stevens of Texas
In his response agreed with Governor
Chamberlain's assertion that the recla
mation law is faulty and' advocated
such reconstruction of the arid land
law as would both extend it and make
It effectual. He thought especially that
the provision which allowed New Mex
ico, In the confines of which the three
big rivers which traverse Texas have
their source, to obtain a portion of the
reclamation funds to the exclusion of
Texas because of that fact, was un
just.
Colonel H. D. Loveland of San Fran
cisco, president of the Pacific Coast
Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Associa
tion, and John Henry Smith of Salt
Lake City followed in short speeches. '
The convention opened auspiciously.
No less than 1000 persons were present
when the president's gavel fell call-
Ins the delegates to order, and the
number was swelled to twice that mag
nitude before the congTess had been
In session an hour. At the night ses
sion hundreds of people were turned
away from the auditorium who had
Â«-been attracted by the fact that a se
lection by the great Mormon Church
Choir. 200 voices strong, of Ogden,
Utah, was on the programme, as well
eÂ» by the fact that United States Dis
trict Attorney Francis J. Heney made
his appearance on a rostrum for' the
first time since he began the prosecu
tion of the notorious land' fraud cases.
PORTLAND, Aug. 21.â"Reclama
tion" and its kindred subjects are ap
parently to share honors with "unde
sirable immigration" in the delibera
tions of the National Irrigation Con
gress, which was opened in the Lewis
and Clark Auditorium to-day for a four
days' session. The subject of "Immi
gration" did not appear to: be unex
pected, nor was its importance mini
mized by .Governor GeoVjje C. Pardee
of California, . president of the con
trress. Governor Pardee thrice read
the motion of William E. Smythe of
California to appoint a comxnittee to
ascertain If action by the congress is
feasible In solving the problem of for
eign Immigration, and then asked
any delegate in the hall who had
failed to hear the motion to
come to the front and hear. It
read m as to vote intelligibly on its
diaposltion. A feature of the day was
the reading by Glfford Pinchot, chief
forester of the United States, of a
message to the congress from Presi
dent Roosevelt.
vtWO THOUSAND ATTEND.
Eberlin'o speech started the foreign
Immigration bee buzzing and a resolu
tion was "Introduced by William E.
Smythe,of California that bids fair to
breed trouble before the congress ends.
It moved the appointment of a committee
to, consider the : subject -of solving the
problem of foreign immigration and re
port whether or not some action by the
congress 'is I feasible. ' Smythe; asked for
Immediate action by the congress, but
this was opposed by' Judge -John E.'Bak
er of California, iwho \u25a0 objected on \u25a0 the
ground that' it established .a bad-" prece
dent. On Judge Baker's motion' the reso
lution was referred 'to 'a "committee. ; ',
Before the session adjourned a mes
sage was . sent to i President Roosevelt
thanking him for his Interest In the cause
of irrigation and v another to United
States. Senator W. A. Clark of Montana,
The troublesome subject of undesirable
Immigration was Injected into the pro
ceedings by C.^"W.- 4 Eberlin*of San Fran
cisco, .chairman of. the section on rural
settlements, who during his address eald
that .-. the Government could store the
floods and reclaim the desert, and pre
pare for the greatest , number to' "make
homes on the land," but not one cent
could . be devoted by the Government to
securing - desirable ' tenants for â¢ the la*nd
after it -had been reclaimed. ; " : * The people
who would occupy these lands at"; some
future time, he said, would govern the
whole United States, and nothing is more_
imperative than \u25a0 an* appreciation of the
fatal tendency. of that character of alien
Immigration- which "moves In* colonies
and continues to remain alien.
The President also warned the people
against "Letting: public lands pass Into
private hands for fictitious reasons."
The necessity , for forest protection was
indicated, the President asking, for the
hearty support of the congress for the
forest service, as an aid to future Irri
gation work.
President Roosevelt's message was re
ceived with rounds ,of applause. Brief
addresses from the chairmen of the sec
tions concluded the session. .
">. ' - IMSIIGRATIOX COMES UP.
A message from President Roosevelt to
the congress was read by Giff ord Pln
chot, chief forester of the United States.
The President reviewed the importance
of â¢ the reclamation work in the develop
ment of the country \u25a0 and counseled pa
tience" until the operation of the recla
mation act should become more exten
sive. The importance and wide scope of
the act was dwelt upon, the President
pointing out that the act unites East
and West and that it â¢ "enforces the prin
ciple of the greatest good to the greatest
number, because 'lt gives each man land
enough to support* his family in comfort."
"The reclamation act is the most pow
erful of all foes to monopoly of the
land," he said.
MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT.
Subdivision of large land holdings is the
natural accompaniment of Irrigation, and other
concrete examples even more striking than
that which I have Just given are easy to find.
Chief Engineer Newell mentions a case in
Montana, where en a tract of land of 2155
acres before It was ' Irrigated four families
were struggling to maka a living. Water was
brought upon the land. It was divided Into
nrÂ»-e.cre tracts, which were sold off at $150 to
$200 an acre, and now - 400 families make a
living where but four could formerly do so.
Secretary * Wilson of the United States De
partment of Agriculture â a' man to whom the
West owes a debt of gratitude second only to
that due tha president â defined his policy when
he tali: "I am in favor of having more homes
out In the West." Irrigation will r build those
homes. Water Is the best immigration agent.
\u25a0 Recently, water was turned into a canal
which reaches a part of the Glenn estate, and
the transformation has begun. â¢ Three hundred
new settlers have come In and bought tracts of
from 40 to ICO acres each ; they have planted
orchards and' vineyards; two new school dis
tricts have been established and In the neigh
boring towns the recently unocupUd houses
have filled up, while the hammer and. the saw
have commenced to make music once more.
In California, as soon as an irrigation", fur
row Is drawn, 1 , tho ownership of tha great
ranches bagins to" disintegrate. In tlw palmy
days oi California wheat trowing, our . pride
and boast was \u25a0 the great 49,0UU-acre ranch of
Ur. Hugh Glenn, on which "JO, OOO to 30.000
acres of grain were cultivated each year, and
from the crop of which twenty ships were
loaded and sent sailing around Cape Horn
to feed the hungry mouths in Europe; 13ut
on this vast domain of fertile soil there lived
but one family â that of the proprietor, and Uw
workmen . consisted of a hundred horaeUss
nomads coming one mor.tb and going the next,
after the manner of "the migratory farmhand.
No schoolhouse was ever -built In this prin
cipality, and under the combined. influences of
land monopoly and. soil exhaustion due to fifty
years'. Incessant cropping with wheat,"' the . al
ways scant population of two counties, situat
ed tn the. very heart of one. of the richest
valley* In the world, was actually dwindling
away. | \u25a0.â¢\u25a0\u25a0'' \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 - '\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0

It would be rash to assume that the
appearance of enormous spots on the

ment of extraordinarily hot weather In
this country is anything more than an
accidental colnclÃence. There may be a
relation between the two events, but
nobody Is wise enough to prove It. A
sun spot is a product of eruptive or
other forces operating on a scale of
almost incalculable magnitude. The

garding its possible effect on tbe earth's

reasons for doing bo must be offered

To be provided with a career and a
salary for life evidently offers a temp
tation that young - men, however ambi
tious naturally, find It hard to resist,
and. in view of the chances that accom
pany the struggle of life, thi3 Is, per
haps, not strange. The professions may
lose, by this fact, the services of those
who would make their mark, but what
they lose the navy gains, and this Is
something for the country to observe
with pride and thankfulness.â Providence
Journal.
The navy, of course, holds out no such
promise of a competency as every em
bryo doctor, lawyer. Journalist, civil en
gineer or other professional ' man sees
before him as he gazes down "life's vista
from the college doorway; but as an off
set there Is not constantly in his sight
and mind the possibility of failure.
Any young man Intelligent enough to
pass the entrance examination has but
to do his duty according to the regula
tions to, make a successful paymaster
and to receive the promotions and emolu
ments that will come to him In the regu
lar routine of the service, while his
brother outside must toll on In the face
of unknown contingencies.
These places are naturally regarded as
much more desirable than those open to
inexperienced young men In business and
professional lines, because they carry
with them fairly good salaries, assur
ances of a career lasting through life,
and provide a pension in the way of re
tired pay after superanuatlon. Brass
buttons, moreover, have an attraction
for men as well as for women, and (t is
no small consideration for a youth on
the threshold of life to be secure in an
honorable career, attractive in more
ways than one, which puts him in the
ranks of those who can pride themselves
that, although wealth cannot come to
them In their profession, honor and fame
may, and that, moreover, they can insist
at all times upon being regarded as
"officers and gentlemen."
The majority of the two thousand can
didates, however, with the inherent reck
lessness of youth, failed to attach due
Importance to the fact that their appli
cations were received solely because
those who were originally designated to
take the required examinations for the
twenty-eight ; . vacancies failed to pass,
therefore making it necessary to let down
the bars and open the competition to
all comers. Only ninety-eight of the two
thousand were permitted 1 -to take the
examinations, the others not being up to
the general standard; seventeen of these
failed to meet the phydcal requirements,
and of the remaining number but twenty
four stood the mental test and they will
receive the commissions.
It may be a confirmation of the popular
belief that the professions are overcrowd
ed, but certainly it is an Illustration of
the lack of promising opportunities open
to young men just out of colleg^ or at
the age when they must begin to earn
a living that two thousand of them
should apply for appointment to twenty
eight existing vacancies in the grade of
assistant paymaster in the United States
navy.

It seems rather strange that' at the very
time Russia appears utterly exhausted by
a disastrous war the British Empire
should be" carefully and systematically
strengthening its defenses in India. That
it has been always Russia's ambition to
reach the sea through the conquest
of India is a fact too well known to be
even called. into question. That her de
feat at . the hands of Japan has In any
way altered that determination is not at
all probable: -on the contrary, the fail
ure to secure the coveted ports In far
east Asia has probably increased the de
sire to secure them elsewhere, either on
the peninsula of India or in the Persian

Is enough of a white Indian to ha,ve been
touched by the unique memorial from
Hereford and a real honest Inspector
without any "pull rope"; entanglements Is
looking up VShep's'^ record. Maybe there
will be something doing, after all, which
will please the. Cherokees.
Now, Mr. President. If you will have Gen

"pull rope," we .will; chow him a condition
that will discrace .', any civilized country on
earth. Mr. President, we are:injuns by blood.
We are of lawful age and residents of the
community from which we- write. We are en
deavoring, to train up the rising- generation
so they may not only make decent 'citizens of
the > great ; republic â¢by which we hope .to bÂ«
recognized â¢as citizens, but : also ' to '\u25a0 reflect

rope." - - â¢: : ,-\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0
We read in the paper how our Great Father
work hard for poor -Russians to keep Jap's
from killing all of It. . Then we â¢ say, "Good,

to handle our mail. : Some of our calefaced
brothers been writing some letters about this
and mail "Direct to the : President," but they
must get caught on "pull rope" somewhere,
cauee we don't never hear about it any more.
We like to have some - one trace ud this
"pull rope" and see what other end fastened
to: Seems like If tother end tied to as rotten
stump as at this end ought to pull up easy.
Anyhow seems we ought to be able to break it

will, hear, from us." They wrote and then
twenty-three ' names cigned It and ; they, say,
"That'9 about all* the decent . Republicans we
know of around, here." .Then -the Democrats,
they write too. jThen; they /swear, to 'a .whole

they send them all -off together. They all say,
"Amen."- Again ;the weeks go by, but General
Fourth Postmaster he : does not answer them
any, mote Into time at all.- Then we feel sad."
Then we wonder .if this bad white man sure
enough got it so much "strong pull" nothing
can be done. Then we think we write about
It ourselves. But we are not acquainted with
General Fourth Postmaster." He may be a Rus
sian; so we think we write to our great, big,
busy. President. -
They then wait about six weeks and the
president of our school board Ire write General
Fourth Postmaster again and tell him about
these letters him cent before and he \u25a0 say to
General Fourth Postmaster, "these letters con
tain specific charges which. If true, entitle us
to a new postmaster. -If false, they entitle
us to go to the penitentiary for slandering the
one we have. Please investigate." General
Fourth Postmaster he write back and say he
will. Th*n the palefaced brothers said, '"If
we can 'ever get an Inspector here that will
settle his hash." Then we all wait a long
time. Some say. "Maybe Inspector bring
whitwash brush." ...

r ASHINGTON, Aug. 2Lâ After enduring
for a long; time the affliction of an un
popular fpostmaster, citizens of Hereford,
a little town in the. lndian Territory, have
pulled the corks f rom . the vials of their,
wrath and turned them loose upon the
President of the United States. "; They
want .a new postmaster and they want
him badly; moreover, they want a native
and; not an importation. The man who
now: hands out' the mail at Hereford
comes ; from Missouri. ? The memorial
which was' sent to tha President is , in
many respects a model oj. a self-contaln
ed.vcalmly fashioned appeal for the ,cor-:
rection of an intolerable situation. It was
referred -by. the President to Fourth As
sistant Postmaster General de Graw and
reads as follows: \u25a0.;\u25a0
Moat â¢ Excellent Sir: Great Father to all
good Indians, we come . to you with . this, our
appeal, since It seems there Is none else who
will heed. We have been taught that" you are
in favor of ' fair play. We have been taught
that you stand for a fair deal. We have betn
taught that - you are ; a friend of the decent
mail. We. believe it and it makes, our hearts
plad. We rejoice in the fact that we imy
some day I become citizens' of a country . with
such a ruler. Kor many weeks \u25a0we have de
fcireJ .to urescnt to the Great Father our Ju.st
cause of complaint. But the paleface brother
who lives among ; us said. "No, the Tresldent
is too busy attending to world \u25a0 matters." . So
we waited, and these good \u25a0 palefaced neigh
bors wrote some letters to a 'bis man they
called General Fourth Postmaster, telling him
about it. : : They tell him that Â« the rr.an who
has been placed in charge of our postof fice is
a bad man; a man with a reputation for dis
honesty. \, untruthfulness, profanity, vulgarity
and many other bad . things. They tell him
that ,ha is not a good . citizen, even if he bs a

tell him he.has cursed our schools. He. has
curÃed our Sunday schools. He has cursed
our churches. â¢ He has referred to our best citi
zens in language too vile for publication. They
tell him he spends his Sunday evenings drink

ânot one of these. adaptations;, was in
any degree of my own' initiation, nor,
although 1 1 prepared all of , them' faith
fully," and Â£ some of.lthem , con .amore
would ' I i have chosen any of them ; yet
it is "by them~my ability Ti.s aplay
.wrightihas. been tested, and it Is upon
their,; failure I have been condemned;
while my own plays, 4'Goldfrida, 1 , 'Self's
the Man,' and .'The Knight of the May
pole,', remain unproduced. ''"":. , i.--.--^
"I then wrote a play of my own and
read It in - succession to three man
agers who listened politely. - I after
ward published this play. Again I made
a play'of my own, this-time upon com
mission, for the theater is gallant and
likes perseverance; ; but the actor-man
ager for whom I wrote It deemed it un
suitable and again I published. V Being
now i once . more mollified, not by | suc
cess, I accepted commissions/for adap
tations and In due: course; made ver
sions of several foreign dramatic pieces,
besides,: at my own urgency," two orig
inal plays."
Davidson; does riot specify, but. one
recognizes one of these as the adapta-'
tion of "RuyÃlas," which Lewis Wal
ler produced Vat ;the Imperial. It was
not 'a success/land evidently the other
adaptations mentioned had the same
fate. .; '-;' ' :\:'-:, : .'\u25a0-.'; ; "'.':. ' \u25a0'..
PLAY UNSUITABLE.
"The, success, of this; play," says Da
vidson, "attractcd^the attention of man

posals for versions were made, but no
one has yet thoughts of..' giving .'me 'a
commission, for \an original play; an

stepped and the matter fell through.
Apropos of J. M. - Barrie. Here's the
playwright's own authority for the state
ment that the report was mistaken which
affirmed that, he was about to visit the
United States. In reply to a;written in
quiryâ Barrie objects ,to Interviewsâ the
author replies briefly: "I am not going to
America this year, though 1 once thought
of doing so." ....
That distinguished poet, John David
son, harbors a rather uncommon griev
ance against theatrical' managers. Ha
is sore over being regarded by the pub
lic as an unsuccessful playwrightâ or
at best as a. "one-play'man"ânotwith
standing the fact that none of the sev
eral original plays of which he is the
author ever has been produced. It will
be remembered' that Davidson 'made the
English adaptation : of | ''Pour, la Cou
ronne," whlcb.^Forbes Robertson gave
over here and "which was^also per
formed in the United States.' >";*-.Â£,

the cap of | this:', comparatively 'young
actor/ who is a notable exception to the
rule that the son : of a great : man must
needs be a mediocrity. Of course, young
Dv ;" Maurier .l owed his first , engagement,
which was by Becrbohm Tree, , chielly \u25a0to
the fact that his father was the famous
cartoonist and author of.; "Trllby," :; but
from the .first 'the | son showed > that ; he*
was able (to stand on his own legs. Ap
propriately enough. , his debut with Tree
was made as Little Blllee, and ! his suc
cessful work soon led to his engagement
by Charles Frohman, with whom he is
now parting. â¢ V ~
Dv Maurler made a distinct hit in "The
Admirable Crichton" as the young aris-;
tocrat whose head had to .be frequently
immersed in a pail of .^ water, and im
proved his reputation still more by really
exceptional acting : as the * son ". in "Little
Mary." In fact, J. M. . Barrie wanted
young Dv Maurier's services right along,
and he played the pirate chief in '.'Peter
Pan," which Maud 'Adams'; is to give: in
the United States next season, and has
recently been playing, in "Pantaloon," the
little curtain-raiser which Barrie wrote
for his play "Alice Slt-by-the-Flre,"
which Ethel Barymore Is to have at
home. -Dv Maurier and. his wife, who was
Muriel Beaumont, one of the prettiest
girls on the "London- stage,' left- town .a'
few daps ago for Dieppe, the French sea
side resort, where they are going to pass
the dog days. At the Haymarket Dv
Maurier will be seen first in "The Love
Path," the new American comedy by C.
M. S. McLellan. He has got" to be so
great a man that almost every one has
forgotten that lie Is his father's son.
Special ; Dispatch to The Call
Prisoners, court attaches and. hang I
crs-on at the Second Criminal Court
were thrown into something of a panic
to-day when a genuine case of yellow
fever was discovered in, the dock. The
man was found ill among a number of
prisoners. A screened ambulance im
mediately carried him to the Emer
gency /Hospital. * A flying squad was
sent for and theVdock and courtroom
thoroughly disinfected.
The patient was an Italian who was
arrested on Saturday night and re
mained in prison until to-day. The
jail will be fumiffated.-
So much dissatisfaction resulted from
the operation of the camp at Sldell that
Dr. White to-day ordered it to be
closed. The camp at Harahan has been
built by the Government. It Is the
first of its kind ever completely erected
and maintained by the Marine Hospital
Service, the buildings being especially
constructed for the purpose.
GREGORY. Mo.; Aug. 21. â Three
cases of yellow fever have developed
here within the past twenty-four hours.
All are Italians. One victim has died
and the other two cases discovered this
morning- are said to be very low. The
three infected Italians, with four other
men of the same nationality, were
brought up' the river to -Gregory re
cently from Greenville, Miss., and em
ployed at track work by the Burlington
Railroad. Excitement is intense and
much indignation Is expressed that the
Italians were permitted to slip through
the quarantine lines. Gregory is a
lumber camp on the Mississippi River,
fifteen miles from Keokuk, lowa.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Aug. 21.â Dr.
J. Y. Porter, State Health Officer, to-day
received an order from Surgeon' General
Wyman of the Marine Hospital Service
to disinfect and hold five days all ves
sels from Colon, Panama, as conditions
there prevent making: vessels absolute
ly safe. This Is in addition to the dis
infection required at Panama. ."\u25a0\u25a0
LITTLE ROCK. Ark., Aug. 21.â The Ar
kansas State Board of Health to-night in
stituted a strict quarantine against the
entire State of Louisiana. '.
Though there was an Increase to
day, both in the number of yellow
fever cases and of fatalities, hopeful
ness continued to pervade the Federal
headquarters touching the local situa
tion. The Monday list/is always larg-'
er. That Is attributed' to'; the" fact- that
the work of inspection is not as thor
ough on Sunday and only the reports
which' come from physicians are to be
depended upon. . ,
In to-day's list of fatuities' two
deaths occurred in the Marine Hos
pital. 'The victims were sailors ad
mitted to . that Institution. Another
death was in the, French Asylum on
St. Anne street. These are the only
two public institutions outside the hos
pitals in which cases of fever have
had to be handled.
NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 21.â Summary
of the yellow fever situation up to 6
o'clock this evening: New cases 61,
total to date 1446; deaths 9, total 205;
new foci 16, total 322; cases under
treatment 328. ;' ;-.'
Incidentally Dr. Tong says he will visit
the larger cities of the United States to
study the Industrial exports to China,
presumably intending to endeavor to have
large exporters to China use' their in
fluence in favor of less severe immigra
tion restrictions upon Chinese. He said
the boycott was a serious movement gen
erally throughout China, instead, as some
think, of being confined to coast cities.
VICTORIA. B. C, Aug. 21.â Dr. T. T.
T. Tong, representing the Imperial Chi
nese Board of Treaty Revision, arrived
by the steamship Shawmut, en route to
Washington, D. C, to interview the Pres
ident regarding Chinese immigration into
the United States. He will study the
classes and character of European immi
gration into the United States with a
view of learning whether China is dis
criminated against by an inferior class of
people being permitted to enter America
from the Atlantic coast, which, he states,
he understands to be the fact.
sentative seamen from the North Atlantic
squadron, now lying in the naval anchor
age at Newport, arrived in this city. The
committee has at its disposal $1000 raised
by subscription among the seamen of the
squadron, and which is to be spent for
the entertainment of the visitors.
NEW YORK," Aug. a.â New York will
be the scene of a remarkable demonstra
tion of fraternity and good will "between
the jack tars of the navies of Great Brit
ain and the United' States during the
first week of October, on the occasion of
the \u25a0'= visit of the twenty-second cruiser
squadron of the British fleet.
On or about the first Monday In the
month 1200 American sailors will enter
tain a like number of their British breth
ren. Arrangements are now making for
ii great banquet, smoker and theater
party, which shall repay Prince Louis of
Bat tenburg's ; men \u25a0- for all ' of the enter
tainment they have showered upon the
Americans In times past.
To-day a committee of three repre-
VICTOJIA. B. C. Aug. 2Lâ News was
received bv the steamship Shawmut'to
day ol'the return to Hakodate or the
Japao*Â® sealing echooner Tora. Maru,
wlth/Â°u r dead and four wounded, with
neV of the murder of fourteen other
fc efÂ«rs of the echooner Matsumoto Maru
b/ Russians off the Kamchatka coast.
â¢pe Tora Maru was hunting Beals off the
lurlles when she picked up a boat of the
Matsumoto Maru containing four men.
They reported that while hunting off the
Copper Islands their schooner had foun
dered during a storm, nine of their crew
drowning with the vessel. The remaining
eighteen. In three boats, managed to
reach the Kamchatkan coast, about llfty
miles northeast of Cape L*)patka. The
fcur men picked up by the Tora Maru
fyaui left the survivors on the beach to
seek a coast settlement where provisions
could be obtained.
The Tora Maru returned to succor the
shipwrecked sailors, but when the land-
Ins place was reached the Russians
opened fire on the Tora Maru boats. It
was learned that the fourteen ship
wrecked sailors had been killed and the
Tora Maru's sealers were driven back to
their vessel with four dead and four
wounded. The Tora Maru then returned
to Hakodate with their dead and wounded.

sea. But Togo has now in his own fleet most of the Russian ships
that were not shot to pieces and sunk. The world has no guaran
tee, that Russia's one more throw of the dice will result differently
from all that have preceded it. What then? Will Russia execute
her threat, to retire into her continental seclusion where Japan can
not reach her and refuse to conclude peace? The world will not
permit such a policy. The world will not recognize a state of
chronic war such as that would be. The proposition is absurd.
Mr. de Maartens. a distinguished Russian jurisconsult, has
stated the Russian reason for refusing to pay indemnity. He says
that there is no precedent for paying a war indemnity when the vic
torious enemy is not in possession of the defeated country's territory
atjd capital. War does not follow^precedents. It makes them. If
Russia had wiped Japan off the sea, invaded the islands and taken
Tokio as Kuropatkin announced his intention to do, Mr. de Maar
tens would consider it right and according to precedent for Russia
to exact a war indemnity from Japan. Logically, then, and if there
is no logic in war, there may be in peace negotiations, Japan has
the right to do to Russia what she has prevented Russia doing
to "ier. ' >-
'T" > HE sudden determination of Russia to make peace only on
I condition that Japan take no benefit from her many victories is
â¢*\u25a0 no doubt due to the revamping of the boasts of Kuropatkin by
Linevitch.

A TELEPHONE OPERATOR.
San, Francisco, Aug 1 . 21.
After rive years spent as a telephone
operator in this city and three years at
a private exchange, my memory Is stored
with the kindness and courtesy shown by
my subscribers, who were gentlemen and
women who appreciated one performing
the duties of the position. The only sting,
the only unhapplness comes from the un
thoughtful tone used ;in speaking and
writing about telephone operators: and to
those who so heedlessly do so, I can only
wish that it might be their good for
tune to spend a week. of their life at a
telephone switchboard, that they might
see and study the conduct of the. young
ladies, who become the help, the aid in
all dangers vwhere the saving of time
means the saving of life, and whose
careful attention to duty gives the pub
lic the comforts md- protection of the
telephone. I â¢ \u25a0"
There is 'no position where one can be
so helpful to the home and the public,
and no matter' what the character of a
subscriber may be, trust and confidence
are soon placed in the voice ' of a faith
ful ODerator who never has : been found
wanting. '
.This is an age when the \ majority of
girls,' as soon' as their school days are
over, seek employment in the business
world, and they are" placed side by side
with the business man. where too : often
they lose' that gentleness which grace
fully adorns all true" women.
Within the! telephbne T exchange the
just laws 'governing the employes; at
the switchboard keep from them â¢ all
familiarity and ah operator may do \u25a0 her
duty and be as reserved as if she had
never left, her own hearth: If temper is
displayed , or. unbecoming' language used
by a subscriber,' she shuts off the switch
at the first word and .connects them with
the manager*
Such is not the case. The telephone
company demands : strict attention to
business and as time counts a great deal
Â»oth to Ul5 subscriber and operator/ un
hecessary words are not . used in their
jrief intercourse.
Those who read the article referred to,
and many a one of similar, tone, which
have come before the public since the
telephone became such a factor in the
world, if they have never been otherwise
enlightened, would certainly : have cause
to think that young women earning their
living at telephone ! switchboards were
not treated as ladles. ' -\u25a0\u25a0 . \u25a0
Reading an particle published , in your
paper \ headed, "Hello Girls of Gotham
No Longer Alarm ; Clocks For Sleepy
Heads," I thought ay few lines I from one
who ' hai : been -eighty years- a telephone
operator might not be taken amiss.

"CENTRAL" AT THE PUBLIC'S EAR
There is no evidence that Mr. Wheelan wishes to be a candidate
for Mayor.- But if he does wish it, the push reason for opposition
'Aiii not stand in his way. The syndicate has also written the plat
form of the coming convention, and is at pains to ignore the only
issue, which is* the defeat of. the push and the grafters. When the
convention makes its own platform, the syndicate will have a story
to tell of how and why the convention changed its platform and
there will be room for more talk about corporate, dictation .and
control of the reform movement. But, while the push chatters and
lies, the Republican League is moving straight forward to results.
Tts splendid organization is in the field in every part of the city,
and business men who heretofore left politics to the politicians are
now giving their time and labor to the movement which will end
graft and push the push into outer darkness.
The literary, syndicate is busy in another direction. It is se
lecting the reform "candidate for Mayor. This is done by the pro
cess of elimination, cancellation of candidates. The push presents
the list of candidates, who by reason of their position and charac
ter would naturally be considered, and then cancels them out one
by one, and asks triumphantly : "Now where will you find a can
dician- and who is he?*' In this way Mr. Fairfax Wheelan and sev
eral others are disposed of. In one respect the push is perfectly
sincere in this process of political cancellation. It has the 'true
Tammany idea that a man must bring spoils into camp as proof
of his qualification for office. He may have all the character and
attainments and training and ability to shine as a useful public
servant, but these do not constitute his qualification in the estima
tion of the push. He must control his district and bring it into
camp. It will be seen that this test of a man's fitness leads to
ballot-box stuffing and all the crimes against the franchise.
Mr. Fairfax Wheelan was a candidate for delegate to the con
vention in the district where the ballot-box stuffers operated last
year. Of course he was beaten. The president of the Board of
Works, the resentful friends of the last year's â¢stuffers; who are
now in the penitentiary through Mr. Wheelan^s "efforts, We push and
the whole citj r administration fell upon Mr. Wheelan and beat him,
as he probably expected to be when he stood for delegate. Tbx
syndicate, true to its Tammany ideas, thereupon announces that
Mr. Wheelan cannot be considered as a candidate for Mayor, and
more than that, he is eliminated from the reform movement and
cannot even be consulted any more. According to this push idea,
the three ballot stuffing convicts in the penitentiary are. eligible
because they carried their district
T^HE administration literary syndicate continues to use the coun-
I try press for the spread of the ideas of the push concerning t.ie
1 recent primary ai\d the coming conventions. The syndicate
seems to consider that the first thing necessary is to put Mr. W. F.
Herrin forward as the patron and sponsor of \ the Republican
League. True, that gentleman has been absent from the city for a
long time and is probably in blissful vacation ignorance about San
Francisco politics, but that makes no difference with . the push
writers. They know that if the railroad and other corporations wish
to make any" use ~of a city administration the present one is the
kind they prefer. They cannot do "business" with the class of citi
zens found at the head of the Republican League. The whole
spirit and moral purpose of the League are above the plane on
which corporations do "business" with government, local or general.
While that is true, it is also true that the raHroads have but
little to ask and less to expect from the city government^'any way.
What they want that is right and proper and reasonable and in line
with the interests of the people, they should have, openly and above
board. A decent and honorable city administration will give it
to them as a right. An indecent and grafting city administration
will sell it to them as a commodity. Therefore the push would
like to have it appear that the reform movement is Mr. Herrin's.
in order to beat the reform movement and thereafter be in a posi
tion to sell to Mr. Herrin anything he may happen to need. That
is genuine push politics. If the seal were taken off the confidential
records of corporations in this State, the revelation. would disclose
that kind of politics running over a period of forty years. The late
C. P. Huntington seems to have been the only man in all the cor
porations who believed in being direct, for he wrote : "Let it be
publicly known in California that the hand of the railroad is under
every friend and over every enemy of the company in politics." That
was "out in the open, at a time when the corporation had cause to be
in politics. But that time and the person have passed. Yet the push
wants what lean picking there may be left on the bones of the
railroad question, and the way to get it is by pretending that the
corporation is still in politics and is back of the reformers in
ihis city.
THE IDEAS OF THE PUSH.

J^l I demanded of the maid who escorted me â¢to my ( apartment in the
\u25a0mall private hoteiat Dublin, and with whom, in the proprietor's
absence, I made arrangements for my stay. For England's extortionate
bills of "extras" had taught me discretion.
. The girl looked at me appealingly out*of her sweet blue eyes, wherein
was a merry twinkle that continually played hide and seek, as she talked.
With true Irish wit she ground her ax demurely. "All but the boots,
miss." : : . , -". ' : ' ' ; \u25a0 \u25a0 "'. ' " * ' ":";' ; ' '\u25a0\u25a0 : .: ' " â¢\u25a0' \ '.".\u25a0 '\u25a0 '
"The boots?" I asked, with pretended, ignorance. . , r
"I are the boots, miss." .
\u25a0 I laughed and she laughed, and she felt as well as I. I think, that an
acquaintance begun with a laugh is well begun.
"And do ye stop long?" asked boots, In the friendliest way.
"No, I am going to Cork to-morrow," I replied, looking regretfully
out of my window at the drizzling rain that threatened to spoil my short
stay In Dublin. . . . ' ..\u25a0\u25a0*\u25a0 ...
"Sure, and that's* too bad, miss," said boot's, with, an earnestness that
resembled reproach. "No wan should leave Dublin without seem' the ciml

"This steak is cooked too much," I complained to the maid who
waited on me at "table.
"And so it is, miss," she agreed affably. "The nature's all out ay it."
And so undisturbed was she at the catastrophe that we let the matter
go at that. ' r
"I would like that guide book to Dublin, please?" I said to a shop

.'. As I was leaving Phoenix Park a storm came up and I took a cabriolet
back to . the center . of - the city, engaging it, unwittingly, just outside the
city limits. When. l gave it up some 'two hours later the cabman wanted
to charge me double rates, the legal fare outside the city, \u25a0 because I had
taken. the cab outside.
"But we weren't outside the city five minutes," I objected, "and I have
kept you within the city for two hours. Surely the inside fare Is right
tor the second hour anyway."
Finally we referred our disagreement to a policeman, who, to my aston
ishment,-took the cabman's side. At my expostulation he explained, with
an amused grin' at my predicament: "Yes, lady, if ye once goes outside
the city ye pays outside fare for the whole time. It's a good rule, too, it
is, for it works both ways,, it does. Ye see, it's just .like this: Sometimes
the fare gets, stuck by It, and sometimes the cabby," though how the cabby
got stuck, unless It was -when he failed to cheat the fare, was more than
my American mind could comprehend. . 1
MARTHA BANKS had pretty features
and it would have required little to
have given these a graceful setting
through a pleasant carriage. and; a .trim
figure. With all thisas "an inducement,
Martha was never able <to acquire that
mysterious something known as taste in
dress. Her mother had it, and her aunt
and her cousins; poor Martha remained
the ugly duckling of the Banks family.
In some way that remains wholly un
explained until this day Martha had ac
quired the notion that the various shades
of dark green were
becoming \ to. her
particular style of
beauty. In this she
was seriously., mis
informed. It had
nothing to do with
green being a styl
ish color at any
time' or place: it
was just a head
strong determina
tion to wear green
or die. So Martha
wore green.
: Her father's
brother's. family
bought a farm
house within an
easy "ride ' oorf r 'the,
city and proceeded
to establish them
selves therein,
transforming it in
to a real country
house by the ex
penditure of coh
siderablfe mo ne y
and the display of
much taste of the
most modern sort.
There were . three
girls in the family,
not one of whom
believed that green
In any shade was
npcessarily her
most becoming col
or, and dressed ac
cordingly. Neither
precept nor exam
ple enabled them
to turn Martha
from her wa y.
though there was a
striking family re
semblance between
the four of them,
. and \u25a0 she | remained
the one of them least worth looking at,
though the most favored by mere nature.
With the prepossession toward green
went an inclination to dress reform. This
is an admirable reform when you are old
and settled enough to stand it. In youth
it has a tendency to dowdiness of form,
and carriage, and it struck a final blow
to Martha's delicate complexion when it
was coupled w;ith dark greensâ any color
so's it's green, to change Eugene Field's
line. With these outward manifestations,
as might have been imagined, went
cided seriousness of thought. As
ter of fact, Martha was not a bit more
serious minded than Margery or Doro
thy -or Cecily, her cousins. Somebody or
other had contrived to impress. her with
the notion that seriousness became her,
in just the same way that she had ac
quired a notion about dark green.
It must be said, however, that whether
dark greens and seriousness became Mar
tha or not, the two certainly, went per
fectly together, no matter how much the
girl herself was disfigured in the process.'
Dress reform, dark .greens, seriousness
and all/- Martha wentJoutUo her aunt's
for a house party. *She'rnlBsed the. train
and forgot to telegraph. It came on to
rain. The house was. two miles from the
station.
Martha \u25a0 was not serious minded for
nothing. When she found no one at the
station to meet her, she simply grasped
her umbrella, *left her suit case:, and
trunks jto be to . latÂ£rV and; set
forth with her little shopping' bag, ; having
obtained accurate directions. And it
rained cats and dogs before she arrived.
All wet and bedraggled, she was wel
comed as effusively as her damp condi
tion permitted and hauled up to Doro
thy's room to change her clothing. The
three sisters had an idea of their own,
and they proceeded to carry It into prac
tice. So they arrayed the girl as she had
never been arrayed before in her young
lifeâ in rose pink with dainty ribbons and
chiffons, the gown being just a little
tight, so that it forced its new wearef to
stand more nearly erect, and her hair be
ing dressed in the most becoming - man
ner imaginable by the happy conspira
tors. | '<:',.â¢ .. ' ..'\u25a0-\u25a0-
There were four young men visiting the
Bankses, brothers' '. to., girls who were
friends. One of them was Arthur Mac-
Mann. When; Martha burst upon 'his
vision,- all arrayed in loveliness as she
was, she swept him off his feet.^.Having
a lot of temperament, he set about_niak
fng violent love that very night.. Martha
had little or; no experience and it; swept
her oft her feet, too. With her gown.and
.the attention it brought her she assumed
a new personality,. forgot her. seriousness
and was just -the light-hearted.' happy
girl her'cousiris had wished her to beâ
and by much the beauty of the family.
The house party, lasted for, -two' happy
weeks. Nearly all the first of : these the
sisters contrived ito have Martha's trunk
mislaid, so that she was forced to : rely
upon borrowed and more becoming gar
ments. They saw which .way ," the land
lay, and 'as Arthur .was a, good match
and not one that they had' in' mind for
themselves they let their matchmaking
instinct have full play. . with their_>moth
er's entire approbation.*
The night before she left for . Chicago

To feed a hungry fellow

Then, tired of giving, saving,
Straight unto heaven he went.

That you saved was that you spent."
THAT IS THE LAW.
WHEN a court records Its opinion,
dear boy, that Is. the law; when it

Time is hard to define. According to
the best poets time has "a heavy 'foot,'
a tooth, a forelock and breakable legs.
It travels in divers . paces ; it , ambles,
trots, gallops, runs, . rolls, and stands
still; It has whips; it crops roses. So
far it seems like a horse. But it" has
a forefinger,;' also . a reckless hand that
writes wrinkles. TJhis explodes the
horse theory. ! Furthermore, time flies.
Hence, "a bird of a time." Time is mon
ey; being also a bird, jj time is a gold
eagle, perhaps ; money is the root of all
evil, and procrastination Is (1) a chicken
thief, (2) a good thing. The wickedness
of time Is beyond question. It is vin
dictive. "I wasted time," m6urns King
Richard, "and now doth time- waste
me." Time waits for no man. Time shall
throw a dart at thee. Time robs us of
our joys. Time will tell. Time is un
thinking. Time possesses its debtors.
The time is out of joint, and well may
it be, considering what a nuisance it
is. Time Is a sea, a sandy beach, a
bank, a shoal and , an abysm. Also It
Is a whirligig, which seems odd when
we recall, that time Is quiet as a nun.
Time is good,: bad, high, fine, rough,
hot, Christmas, spring, waltz, common
and lovely. Among good v times may be
mentioned quitting time and dinner time.

While in New York the Governor
closed up the deal for the sale of the
new issue of Hawaiian 4 per cent
bonds, which will refund the older 5
per cent issue. Althougn the bonds
were offered to the highest bidder and
it was expected that they would be
taken up by some of the New York
firms that had shown considerable in
terest in the refunding project, the
highest bidder was Banker William Ir
win of Honolulu, who purchased the
entire amount offered, that is $600,000.
The bonds sold at 101%.
"My visit to the President was of a
most pleasing nature, for he is an ex
ceedingly interesting man, and he used
his persuasive powers to the end that
I am going back to Honolulu to re
sume my duties as Governor. We dis
cussed the affairs of Hawaii thorough
ly and I was pleasantly surprised by
the great amount of Information the
President has regarding the territorial
Government, showing how keenly he
watches public interests."
Governor G. R. Carter of Hawaii re
turned yesterday from the East, where
he was in conference with ! President
Roosevelt at Oyster Bay. He is ac
companied by his wife and daughter,
and they are staying at the St. Fran
cis Hotel intending to depart on the
steamship Mongolia lor Honolulu.
The principal purpose of the Gov
ernor's visit to Oyster Bay, was to talk
with President Roosevelt relative to
his plans for relinquishing the posi
tion of chief executive of the islands,
but the conference resulted in the
Governor changing his intentions. In
speaking of the matter yesterday he
said:
However, the publicity attached to
the affair seemed to have unbalanced
the sensitive mother's mind. She had
been a sufferer from rheumatism for
years. 'When she heard of her daugh
ter's trouble she became worse and
finally had to be removed to the Ger
man Hospital, where she died.
Mrs. Utschig was 52 years old and a
native of Milwaukee, Wis. Her husband,
John Utschig, Is a member of nearly all
the prominent German societies arid one
of the best snots on the coast. Mrs.
Utschig was prominent because of her
generosity.
The tragedy that hastened Mrs.
Utschig's end occurred on July 15.
Gustav Hueter, her son-in-law, became
jealous of his young wife, to whom he
had been married in 1896. During the
night he threatened to kill her. Mrs.
Hueter, fearing that he would carry out
his threat, shot and killed him with a
revolver. She was arrested, but on
July 21 she was exonerated -by the
Grand Jury of Santa Clara County. It
was maintained that she shot purely in
self-defense. ,
: Mrs. Utschig- became ill soon after
her daughter's trouble. She was taken
to the German Hospital twelve: days
ago. The best of care was given her,
but she gradually became worse. The
notoriety attached to her. daughter's
name preyed upon the mothers-m ind
and she passed away yesterday. Â» Her
husband, her two sons and Mrs. Hueter
were at the bedside when death came.
Mrs. Kate Utschig, mother of Mrs.
Gustav Hueter, who shot and killed her
aged husband in her home near Alma,
died at the German Hospital yester
day. Cerebral hemorrhage is given as
the cause of her. death, but it is whis
pered that the true cause was a broken
heart. : ;

; It looks as if the appointment rested
between Mr. Damrosch, the Eastern fa

nothing about the proposition to put
him in the chair. ,, Just the same,', local

tion that he is to be chosen.
\u25a0 The mention of the . name of Walter
Damrosch as professor of this new chair
has attracted attention to Berkeley from
musicians all over, the ..country.- By
persons who are on the. inside re
garding this matter, it is reported
that Damrosch would accept the place
had he a direct offer. .The prestige , it
would give him, considering the world
wide fame the University â¢of California
has gained, would compensate for the
financial loss he would experience by re
moval from the East, especially when It
is considered that that . loss would be
greatly minimised'- -by" the additional
money he would earn by accepting the
leadership of an orchestra in San Fran

Surveys are now being made on
the- Bear River aud then the commis

American River.
The Yuba T^iver has suffered more
than any otht* stream in regard to
debris, tnd to tb: s the Government has
turned with a bc<?i n g hand.
Captain Harts tod of a large dam
which is now in progress of construc
tion across the Yubu about Bixteen
miles above Marysville, and when com
pleted will be forty-two feet high,
have a spillway of 400 f?et and will
cost In the neighborhood Â«jf $500,000.
Work began on this &%m ' last sum
mer, but owing to the short season of
low water only eight feet was con
structed. This summer another ten
feet will be completed and the work
will be carried on until the lam Is
finished.
Those dams and retaining walls were
the subject of discourse early in the
lecture and the construction, failures
\nd successes were put forth in an
B '*e way. Most of these dams, as ex
*'a^ed by the speaker, were made of
brus'n an^ rocks, which would~allow
the d*Â» r i 8 to settle and the water to
run ove* the top. A great many of
these da\g proved unsuccessful and
were was*,^ ou t during : the flood
time. \
Captain W. \V. Harts, secretary of
the California Debris Commission, gave
an illustrated lecture at the Academy
of Sciences building last evening onathe
Improvement work that Is being done
on the Yuba River by the United
States Government, and the State of
California. The Yuba, Feather, Bear
and American rivers have been a con
stant sourct of annoyance and serious
injury to the Sacramento Valley be
cause of the great quantity of debris
they have carried Into tne valley, fill
lug the navigable streams and causing
overflows that destroyed fertile lands.
This condition has not been helped
by the hydraulic mining, which up to
a few years ago was allowed without
hindrance, washing down large moun
tains and allowing the debris to run
uncontrolled into the rivers and val
ley.
A few years ago a law was passed to
etop this wholesale destruction of the
rivers and all hydraulic mines were
chut down except a few that obtained
from the Debris Commission a permit
to build dams and retaining walls to
catch the debris and keep it put of
the rivers.

FALSE HUNGER. '
A (rnptnn of Stomach Trouble Cot-
rrcted by Good Food.
There Ib, with some forms of stomach
disease. a.n abnormal craving for food
which Is frequently mistaken for. a
"good appetite." A lady teacher writes
from Carthage, Mo., to explain how
with Rood food she dealt with this sort
of hurtful hunger.
*1 have taught school for fifteen
years," she writes, "and up to nine
years ago had good, average health. My
diet was always generous. . comprising
whatever I took a fancy to. I ate free-
ly. Nine years ago. however, my health
beg-an to fall, and continued to grow
worse, steadily, in epite of doctor's pre-
scriptions, frequent, changes of resi-
dence and everything I could do. Dur-
iqg all this time my appetite continued
good, only tbe more I ate the more I
wanted to eatâ l was always hungry.
The first symptoms of ray breakdown
were a distressing nervousness and a
loss of flesh. The nervousness grew so
bad that finally it amounted to actual
prostration. Then came stomach trou-
bles, which were very painful, constipa-
tion wbich brought on piles, dyspepsia
and Revere nervous headaches. The doc-,
tors seemed powerless to help me, 6ald
I was overworked, and at last urged me
to give up teaching, if I wished to save
my life.
"But this I could not do. I kept on at
it as well as I could, each day growing
more wretched, my will power, alone
keeping me up, till at last a good angel
suggested that I try a diet of Grape-
Nuts food, and from that day to this I
have eaten it, finding it delicious, al-
ways appetizing and satisfying. I owe
my complete restoration to health to
Grape-Nuts, and my persistence In
using it. My weight has returned, and
for more than two years I have. been
free from the nerx'ousness, constipation,
piles, headaches and all the -ailments
that used to punish me so, and have
been able to work f freely and easily."

Siberia Makes Fast Rnn.
The Pacific Mall Company's liner Siberia,
Captain J. Tremalne Smith, arrived yesterday
at Honolulu, four days 'and nineteen hours from
this port. This Is the record trip, but under
all the circumstances Is somewhat of a disap
pointment to the Pacific Mall Company. She
left here with an extra supply of coal specially
selected for the purpose and fifteen additional
coal passers were shipped to feed the extra
fuel Into the furnaces. Then, the star passen
ger was E. H. Harrtman. president of the com
pany, and with Harrtman was R. P. Schwerin,
vice president and general manager. In his
desire to make a record Schwerin even left be
hind 250 sacks of United States mail. With
it all, however, the Siberia under trial trip
conditions only beat the Korea's record by
threÂ« hours. The Siberia must have averaged
s-bout 17.80 knots. One reason for the hasta
was to give Mr. Harrlman some extra time In
Honolulu without Interfering with the liner's
schedule. '-. '--^ \u25a0'â¢;.. -.J-*

by the fact that south of Ono Hun

are being made ready in - hotels yet in
course of construction.' Many of the
hotel patrons arc, foreigners, but the
great majority are Americans who have
come to "see New. A ork." ' : .
NEW YORK, Aug. 21.-^ A glance at
the hotel 1 registers, thronged restau
rants and cafes, streams of theater
goers and* countless sightseeing ve
hicles, shows that there are J more visi
tors In New York at the present time
than at any. corresponding period in
years. Nearly every one of the ninety
large hotels devoted to the accommoda
tion of transient visitors, in which
there is a total of 'more than 21,000
rooms, is filled .to Uts j capacity, and so
are the eighty apartment hotels for the

The colony is constantly receiving , re
cruits from South Africa. The latest 'to
arrive are W. J. Viljoen and wife, | the
parents of General Benjamin Viljoen.
General Viljoen has four grown sons In
the colony. One of his sons was married
about a ' year ago â¢to a daughter of Gen
eral Snyrrian.'and Is the father of a fine
boy. 'There are therefore four generations
of~;the' hardy Viljoens - in this thriving
Bper> colony, f. This- first-born Mexican-
Boer has,, been christened Enrique Creel
in honor, of "the 'distinguished Governor
of the State of Chihuahua, who has lent
every .assistance to the" colontets In their
cherished^ pla.n / to;: establisn j a home for
themselves: Wv Mexico. : . .
: More tha# twenty j| more families are
now on : their* way from South Africa to
Join these"; colonists.! Land" will be appor

every possible aid ' toward establishing
them in: their hew. home will be given by
the resident colonists and the Mexican
Government ."authorities.
MEXICO CITY. "Mexico. , Aug. 21.â The
colony of Boers, which was established in
the Valley of the Conchos River, in the
State "of Chihuahua -about two years ago,
is in a prosperous* condition. The-'pro
moter of- this colonization "movement was
General W. D. Snyman. the veteran Boer
leader, and fighter. He directs the "affairs
of the colony with. a master hand, and. ls
beloved by his people."
The land which the colonists own Is
very rich and is being brought to a high
state of ;" cultivation. âA \u25a0.\u25a0 largo crop of
wheat- and corn was raised ; this season,
and the colonists. will lay up money. The
farms are well stocked with cattle, horses
and hogs. 'The men . of ' the ' colony ' are
bardy specimens â¢ of vigorous manhood,
although some of- them are. far past the
medium of 'â¢ life in years. Unlike- other
farmers in Mexico, they are doing without
Mexican labor as much as jwsslble. Their
experience with the Mexicans the .first
year proved tha'tTciass of :aoor* unreliable
and unsatisfactory. The colonists work
their own farms separately, and when in
a pinch they exchange labor with one
another. '-'*.
The Australia Is a vessel of 2755 tons.
She Is 376:9 feet long; 37:4 feet in beam
and 18:7 feet deep. After the Australia
and Zealandla had been built, they were
cut In half and a section sixty feet long
was Inserted In each. They are prob
ably the longest vessels for their beam
In the world. The Australia Is com
manded by Captain James Rennie. who
has with him fifty-eight officers and men.
The other officers are: J. O. Connor, chief
engineer; R. A. Caughell, chief officer;
M. J. Downs, second officer; P. A. Han
son, third officer; I. O. Shlpman, first
assistant engineer; A. J. Barrett, second
engineer, and J. B. Jewell, third engineer.
Iff. R. Smith Is the chief steward.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's liner
Australia, Captain Rennie. has been cap
tured by the Japanese. She was taken
August 13 In the harbor of Petropav
lovski by the commander of the Japanese
squadron Bent to Kamchatka. The Aus
tralia was chartered by Roth, Blum &
Co. of this city to carry supplies to ten
of Russia's far northern fur stations.
She was to have brought home from each
station the season's catch of furs. This
business before the war was all handled
through Japan. After war was declared
the Russian Fur Company, which con
trols these stations, had to make other
arrangements and several vessels char
tered hero successfully made the trip.
The Australia and her twin sister, the
Zesiandla, were built In Glasgow In 1875.
They first came to this port when they
were bought by the Pacific Mail Com
pany to run between here and Australia.
When the Oceanic Company secured the
Australian mail contract they bought the
two steamers, lmoroved their engines
and put In new boilers. The Australia
ran between hwe and Honolulu for a
number of years, but had been laid up
quite a while when Roth, Blum & Co.
chartered her.

A GREAT RACE
CandidateÂ»-for thÂ« University of <3alJ
fornia footbal!t"sa.)Liad gatbcre^lfor the
n'rst â¢ time " yestefday &t ternoqn. shook
hands with their coaches, were given
their suits and Sid a few "stunts" about
the training field. J.' W. Knibbs Jr. and
Dr., F. B. Griffin, the new coaches from
Dartmouth, Captain Force and .Trainer
Christie looked over the material with
which they will have to work. \u25a0'<
While Knibbs and Griffin nave met
most of the men individually since their
arrival from the Bast, this Is .the first
time they have had an -opportunity to
see them together and in* football cos
tume to watch their \u25a0 mqtions and put
them through their paces.' "This they
did yesterday, and as the men formed
end worked out a little they watched
them carefully, studying their charac
teristics with the trained eyes of the
man who knows what be is about and
what he wants. . â¢> ..'\u25a0 \u25a0 ,
Knibbs found plenty of willing material
and plenty of men who had good training
in the teams of last year. He ' found also
that the California team of 1305 will be
deficient In .weight. It will be one of the
lightest teams that has ever been put
in the fleW by the State institution -With
the exception of Haffey and Taylor, no
cne of the men is over 193 pounds in
weight. The word that comes from Stan
ford Is that their team for the present
year will be far heavier than this.
* It developed that Captain' Force will be
one of the heaviest "men In the squad.
He is slated for: his <sldT>osition of tackle.
A thorough canvass Is to be made of the
freshman class to see if some big mate
rial cannot be developed.' \ . :
California -will -have -<welve~out~oÂ£ the
eighteen men who played against Stan
ford last year, which is a good nucleus
with which to begin. Of the six who- have
left college all are big men like Stroud
aid Heltmuller. This is ; - not causing
worry- The Dartmouth coaches have had
to work with light teams bero/e,.and they
arc thoroughly confident that with their
experience "with just -such- material as
tbe-Tnow have they will be able. to work
cut a winning team. - â
One of the new plans of training will
be work six days **. the- week- , Hereto
fore Saturday work was ora tted,, but
Knibbs wants training constantly. It will
be some time before definite plans of
practice are begun.

AMERICAN LEAGUE.
Both Barry and Burns are within a
few pounds of the weight limit. DayÂ«
weighed 163 pounds yesterday. Burns
said he was .equally, as close to the
mark, so there Is no fear that â¢ either
will lose the $500 weight forfeit.
Doping ring contests Is a hopeless
task and even though Barry did lose
a decision to Burns on a former oc
casion it does not necessarily follow
that Tommy will repeat. Barry is In
better shape than ever before. * . If
Burns wins from him the Irishman
will not be -subdued without a" strug
gle, as no gamer boxer lived than Dave
Barry. , Â»
Twin Sullivan won a hair-line de
cision over Barry and when Sullivan
and Burns hooked up it seemed Sul
livan had a shade the best of it. but
the decision was a draw. This contest
was fought with clean break rules, a
condition which favored Burns. ; Mike
Schreck won a dlcision oVer : Burns
when Tommy was an amateur and
made a draw with- him later; takln?
the two battles Burns mads -with
Schreck and the whirlwind contest
Barry put up with Schreck at Salt
j Lake as a line it seems Barry's work
was- the best. '***-;.Â£'
Eastern sporting men now in this
city fancy \u25a0 Tommy Burns to win hia
contest with Dave Barry on the 31st
lnst. at Woodward's Pavilion. These
| men have not as yet seen the rugged
Dave in action, and they are going to
play Burns simply because they are
I mWe familiar with his ring career. If
; the last three or four fights Barry and
| Burns j have made with different op
ponents are any line upon which to
draw a conclusion on the coming con
test between these two It looks to the
dopester that Barry' 3 chances are the
brightest.

HARD TO BBAT THE GATE.
The small boys who have been figuring
on how they can gat in without the for
mality of presenting a ticket at the door
have a difficult problem to solve. Alter
the arena is built it will be surrounded I
with a high board fence. Outside. this._ at â¢
a distance of thirty feet, will be another
fence, which will also be unscalable.
Mounted policemen will patrol tne
grounds, so that much ingenuity must be
expended to beat the gate. _ .
The officials of the United Railroads
are making preparations to handle an
enormous crowd on Admission day.
The company is bent on giving tne
public good service and it has prom
ised to have the electric cars running
along the new route directly down the
Mission road to the arena Instead or
down Onondago avenue to San Jose
avenue. â¢ The... new route .will save
from six to 1 6lght minutes in time and
will tend to .hasten the travel by the
fact that the road has no turns.
Manager Jim Coffroth announced last
night that- he has secured exceptionally
liberal railroad rates from the Southern
Pacific Company for out-of-town sport
ing men who are coming to this city
to see the battle. A fare of one and a
third will be allowed to any person
in this State who lives at a point
where a single fare to San. Francisco
is* $10*. or. less: 1 Where ordinarily a
single fare to the city is $10 the round
trfp- can be made for. $13 33. Similar
rates will be allowed to parties of fif

tance than this. Single fares will be

ECZEMA
ITCHES AND BURNS
. The return of warm weather means a
return of torture to Eczema sufferers.
The blood is charged with burning: acids
and acrid matter which is forced to tho
surface through the . pores and glands,
forming pustules which discharge a sticky
fluid, and the itchii.g is intense.
The doctors said. l bad pustular Ec-
i zerma; it would break out in small -whi to
pustules; mostly on my face and hands,
discharging a sticky fluid; crusts would
form and drop off, leaving- the skin red
! and inflamed. I -was - tormented with
: the itching: and burning: character-
istic of the disease for five years,' and
during: the time used various medicated
soaps, ointments and washes, but these
applications seemed to make me worse.'
After taking: S. S. S. a short time I be-
uan to improve; the itching: did not
; worry me so much. - I continued \u25a0 the
; medicine, and soon all the ugrly erup-
tions disappeared and mvskin 13 now as
oloar as anybody's. I nave not " been
troubled with any breaking* out since.

NEW YORK, Aug. 21. â General recoverlea
from last week's slight reaction were the rule
In the stock market to-day, but trading was
Cu'.l. For want of some better excuse the
ctreet attributed the falling off of business to
the latest development* at Portsmouth. It Is
, a fact, however, that the eubsanlal flnÂ«n.-iai
iiKreste are at last beginning to display some
thing mere than languid Interest In the prog
ress of peace negotiations. The more marked
advances to-day, of which there were several,
were limited largely to the co-called high das*
of Investment stocks. There were a few ex
ceptions, notably Reading, which moved to a
high record, while other less active Issues at
tained the highest level reached In this move
ment. The advances In Delaware and Hud
con and the Hill sucks attracted Uttle atten
tion inasmuch as it Is generally recognized that
the floating supply of these and similar Issues
is small and manipulators art thus enabled
to move them at will. The Gould stocks were
prominent In the day's movement, though no
ppecial reasons other than good crop conditions
\u25a0were beard. Western advices tell of a'short
age of cars to meet the coming crop require
ments and It Is Quite likely that the trans
portation facilities en most of the more lm
j^rtant railway systems will bÂ« greatly, over
taxed once thÂ« crop movement gets under way.
Chicago Â«Twts ~ unusually \u25a0 heavy traffic East
H.n<i West, shipments pf flour aad grain being
grr-atly In excess" bt the corresponding periods
last year and traffic managers of the- great
grain carrying lines are. optimistic to an un
wonted degree on the outlook. There was a
noteworthy aiasenee of activity during the day
In such etocks as have recently been marked
leaders. Trading in Union Pacific, Southern
Pacific. St. Paul and Atcbison was relatively
nominal and similar, pressure was shown
throughout. This also applied to the leading-
Industrials, including United States Steel com
mon and preferred^; Amalgamated Copper mads
no response to' a. turther. advance lnthe:prtoo
or the metal. â¢ American -Smelting was again:
moderately, active though^ irregular. Of the
minor railway etocks, almost the only one call
ing for comment is Wisconsin Central common
and preferred making further advances on a.
renewal of rumors hinting at a change of con
trol. The movemet* of the more active Issues
In both the railroad and Industrial groups were
without importance, although more or less
abortive efforts were m2.de to advance . certain
of them. Commission â¢ business showed .a very,
ellgrht increase and a greater part of this- cade:
from wire houses. The final hour was quite
the dullest of the day with art Irregular =clos-.
Ing. â¢ London's participation In this market was
disappointingly email In view of the strength
cf Americans at that center. ' Foreign bankers
are mostly, of the opinion that the â¢ continent
*k"J< more inclined to buy here on slight -recession
_^-an on any marked development of strength.-
Time and call money rates were practically un
changed ar:d Indications point to a slight
hardening In long time loans in spite of the
light demand. There was a temporary halt in
the flow of cash to the Interior, but "this -Is
expected to assume Its fullest i proportions in
thÂ« course of the next few wc-eks.

Mrs "Julia Groome, neatly attired In

why she suspected Mrs..Liizie Fettgether

a bureau drawer in a rear apartment of
her delicatessen shop at 3012 Sixteenth

"Mrs. Fettgether came In," . said Mrs.
Groome,. "and said she would" like to sit
down and -have a nice, long talk, so I In
vited her to my living room (not. thinking
anything of thajt). and. she sent out for a
bottle of beir and I drank most of it (not
thinking 'anything , of that), '.and a girl
came in and; used 'the telephone (and I
didn't think Anything of that), and Mrs.
Thomas O'Regan, my, stepdaughter, came
In and played- the organ (and I didn't
think anything of that), aod somebody
called me out- to the ' Store, ta change a 33
geld piece and I went and got the change
out of my bag In the bureau drawer. (not
thinking anything of Mrs. Fettgether see
ing that), and when I gave the change
and returned to the sitting-room Mrs.
Fettgetber was fussing at the bureau (but
I didn't think anything of that), and then
we had . more organ playing by Mrs.
O'Regan, and then Mrs. Fettgether said
ehe must be going (and I didn't; think
.anything of that), and then she bought
flvii - cents' worth of cake (and I "didn't

went out I missed $100 from my moneyâ".

Lawrence Armondo of 655 Green Etreet
was partaking of stew In a Front street
restaurant when Dan Murpby poked a
\u25a0oiled finger Into the savory mess, licked
the digit and remarked, "That's good
ttuff ; I guess I'll order some." Mr.' Ar
mondo, being of fastidious habit and un
acquainted with Mr. Murphy, complained
of that gentleman's act, whereupon Mr.
Murphy smote and blackened one of his,
eyes.
"Have you - any witnesses to prove
that?" inquired the attorney who was
defending Mr. Murphy before Judge Con
lan.
Thomas Xagle, who was accused of
having broken a window belonging to
Thomas Dougherty at 1354 Foleom street,
roundly chificd the complainant for hav
ing caused his arrest.
"If the window really was broken by
me," he said to Mr. Dougherty, "why
didn't you ask me for my card?"
As he did not look like a person who
would carry a card, case, \u25a0 Judge Fritz
asked him what his occupation was, and
he replied that he worked in an iron
foundry.
"I always carry my union card," he
added, "and if the complainant had asked
me to show it to him 1 would have com
plied with his request." j.' :
Then he promised to replace the broken
pane and the case was dismissed. -
Then she scanned the magisterial coun
tenance critically and with propitiating
smile exclaimed: "My! how well you are

"Patrolmen Ward and Skaln have tes

statement than to your uncorroborated
denial of their charge."
"Which means?" said Miss Hines, In

luminous answer.

Henry Daly, Huckster, was ar.-ested
by Humane Officer Hooper for driving
along Sansome .street a horso with a
bandaged foot. The defence otfero
Judge Mogaa was to the effect that as
the animal did not .place this maimed
hoof upon the ground he did. not hurt
It and therefore was not subjected to
cruel treatment.
Clerk "Pat" Grey asked Bailiff Ma
honey why Mr. Daly's, horse vas" ro
mindful of an example In arithmetic,
and then answered the conundrum by
saying that the animal put. down three
and carried one. Then the pro ie:u tins
attorney Informed Mr. S Daly that the
defense was In worse condition than
the horse. Inasmuch as It had not a
\u25a0ingle leg to stand ' upon, rirhile the
beast had three.
His Honor continued the hearing to
afford the court attaches time in which
to think up some more facetiae.
It was brought out In testimony that the
ball in Eintracht Hall last Saturday night
was conceived and carried out for the
pecuniar}' benefit of a one-legged gentle
man whose intention was. to -devote the
proceeds to the purchase of a new artifi
cial nether limb, the one he possesses now
being ramshackled through long and ac
tive usage. It was also shown by oral
evidence that John . McKeown,' piano
mover, was not only the prime originator
of tbo ball, but bad been Its chief pro
moter throughout the preliminary "boost
ing," and also had served as floor mana
ger without salary or any recompense
other than the gratitude of the beneaci
ary. - Therefore the . arrest ; of j Mr. Mc-
Keown on the charge of battery, while he
was pursuing his self-imposed managerial
task, was considered deplorable by all
except those who had fallen before his
onslaught.

commenced. craciinx open. I tried e*ery-
I thi&s, almost, that couU be thought of, with-
out any relief. The . rath of June X started
West, in hopes I could reach the Hot Springs.
I 1 reached Detroit and was so low I thought I
should have to go to the hospital, but finally
got as far as Lansing,' Mich., where 1 had a
sister living. . .One Dr.â â :â: â treated me about
. two weeks, but did me no good. All thought
I' had but a short tlms to lire. I earnestly
prayed to die. ' Cracked through the s -in all
over my back,' across my ribs, arms, hands;
limbs ; feet badly srrollen ; toe-nails came of! ;
-finger .nails dead . and hard as a bone ; hair
dead, dry, and lifelesj aa old straw. Omy
God I how I did suffer.
'."-My sister,-Mrs.E.H. Davis, had a amall
part of a box of Cuticura in the house. She
wouldn't give Â«p; said, "We will try Cuti-
cuTa.". Some 'was applied on one hand and
arm.- Knreka ! there waa relief ; stopped the
terrible burning sensation from the word go.
They Immediately got Cuticnra Resolvent,
Ointment, and Soap. I commenced by takisf
one tablespoonful of Cutieura Resolvent three
; times a day after meals; had a bath once a
day, water about blood heat; used Cnticura
Soap freely ; applied Cuticnra Ointment morn-
ing and evening. Result: returned to ray.y'
home in just Â«ix weeks from the time I lefC^f
and my skin as smooth as this sheet of paper.' * <
