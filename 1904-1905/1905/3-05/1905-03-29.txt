will not wait for the Sen

cision he proclaims a protectorate over
th Â©"-island for the purpose of keeping

The fact that the President has pro

Important to the United States than
his decision to supply Santo Domingo
with an American who shall take
possession of the customs receipts at

States.
No matter what may happen, the
United States Is committed to a policy
of using force to any extent that may
Â» be required for the purpose of putting
down revolutions or preventing for
eign interference with Morales. It
would seem â .hat a very lively sum
mer's work has been cut out for the
navy, and, perhaps, for the army as
well. Whatever steps foreign govern
ments may take fur the collection of
claims not Included in the new ar
rangement, the United States is bound
to stand between these creditors and
Morales. Whatever revolutions . may
start, - the United States is bound to
put them down' by moral suasion, if
l;ossible, and by guns. if necessary.
Filibustering expeditions and debt
collecting expeditions l alike must be
kept from landing on the shores of

CHICAGO, March 28. â The Federal
Grand Jury to-night returned an in- !

general superintendent of Armour & ;
Co., on â  charge of interfering with i
ia witness summoned to appear before j
the Jury now Investigating the so
called beef trust. Connors, who is J.
Ogden Armour's most confidential em
ploye and the active, head of one of J
the largest packing companiss of the
world. was arrested on a bench war
rant by a deputy United ate mar
shal and brought to the Grand Jury
room where he was released on $5000
bond. After his -release Connors re
fused to disucs^ the matter. '.;.;", V, ;

employe of Armour <* col. \Lhiiiesii- A

proached, favored and e'UertPsned by
Connors, and ..specifically,' states that
on March* i's the, :. offense â  was commit
ted upon which Connors was indicted. i
It is also charged that Shields. was giv
r en the use of Armour & Co.'s offices at |
12051 205 La Salle street to transact his
business while In Oh ice go and also the i
use of the private telegraph wires in \
the office of the packing company.
Another allegation is that Shields was
entertained by Connors. and that Con
nors suggested that Shields should tes- !
tify favorably to Armour & Co. and !
not tell all that he knew concerning j
the matter under investigation.
The second count of the indictment j
charges that Connors flid not limit his \
attempt at influencing witnesses to i
Shields, but that other witnesses, who
have not yet appeared in Chicago,
have been approached by him and at- j
tempts made to influence them as to
the nature of the testimony they may
give before the Grand Jury. .
When the special Grand Jury con
vened last week. Shields' was one of
the first witnesses to appear. He
came to Chicago from New York. He
had testified before a Grand Jury sit- i
ting in New York and there is said ;
to have divulged facts which led the
Federal officials to believe him in pos
session of many other details concern- !
Ing the question under consideration- !
He was requested to come to Chicago
and the Federal officials were instruct
ed to watch the. man closely. Two j
men were detailed to watch Shields, j
One of these secret service men ob- !
tamed Shields' confidence and thus !
learned facts which doubled the pre- i
cautions of the Government to pre- j
vent any of the witnesses from being ]
coached. Shields was followed "by j
these detectives and it was learned j
that he frequented the offices of Ar- j
mour & Co., having a private wire at
his disposal and answering all his pri- '
vate correspondence- there. . '
The matter reached a climax yes
terday when one of the secret service
men submitted a report to his superi
ors. To-day Shields was in the Grand i
Jury room from 2 o'clock to 5 o'clock.
The section of the statutes under
which the indictment .was drawn pro
vides that any , person who interferes
with a witness shall be subjected to a
fine of $500 or imprisonment for three !
months or both.

A prominent head of one of the diplo

that he had not received any word
from his . Government' on the subject
for several days and had heard nothing

WHY THE AVAR WAS BEGUN.
KuÂ«Â«la Refused to Regard Japan as
China's duurJiitn.
PARIS, March 28.â The press is in a
position to complete the diplomatic
story of the Russo-Japanese relations,
resulting in the war, by giving to the
world the exact text of Russia's final
reply to Japan, dated February 3, 1904,
which has" never before been made
public. Barcn Rosen, former Russian
Minister to Japan, did not have an
opportunity of presenting the note to
Baron Komura. the Japanese Foreign
Minister, as it was not delivered to
him until February 7, the day after
he had been informed of the rupture.
Russia has always claimed that the
Japanese Government, having decided
to break off negotiations and begin
hostilities, deliberately held up the
message at Tokio until Kurino, former
Japanese Minister in St. Petersburg,
could deliver the instructions sent to
him on February 6 to sever diplomatic
relations. Japan, on the contrary, con
tended that the contents of the reply
having been substantially communi
cated by Foreign Minister Lamsdorff
to Kurino and being unacceptable on
the main issue, it was useless for Ja
pan to wait any longer. The text of
the proposition follows:
1. A mutual encasement to respect the Inde
pendence and territorial integrity of Korea. .
â  â¢; 2. An engagement ' on ' the - part â  of â  Russia
not :to . impede the T commercial ;- or , industrial
undertaking!) of Japan In ; Korea," or oppose ; her
measures for safeguarding such' irterests. --Â<'
3. Recognition by Russia of Japan's pre
ponderating interests in Korea, and her right
to offer Â«dvice and assistance tending to thÂ«
improvement of the administration of Korea.
4. a mutual obligation not to use any part
of Korean territory for strategic purposes,
nor undertake on the coasts of Korea any
military works which would menace free
navigation cf the Korean straits.
6. Rei-cgnition by Russia of Japan's right
to send iicoi v to Korea In accordance with the
precepdinr article for the suppression of in
surnsciiorfif and lisr.rder calculated to create
international complications.
<:. An pngagi'ment by Russia to respect the
rights and privileges acquired by Japan, as
well as cth-?r powers, in Manchuria through
treaties with China. Japan to recognize Man
rhurla anrt the littoral ea beyond her sphere
of interest.
7. A mutual agreement not to impede the
junction of the Korean and Eastern China
tailroads when they will have reached the
Valu River.
8. That this agreement supplant all pre
vious agreements between Russia and Japan
respecting Kor?a.
9. The desirability, if possible, of creating
a neutral zone In Korea.
A careful comparison of the fore
going and preceding exchanges, all of
which heretofore have been printed
fully, confirm the fact that Russia,
from the first to the last, Insisted that
it was inconsistent with her dignity to
include in a special treaty with Japan
an obligation to respect the territorial
integrity of China in Manchuria, reit

that the Russian army sacrificed gen
eral commissariat stores to the value
of $1,250,000 and stores for an army
corps amounting to $500,000 held at
Mukden, most of it having been set
on fire. The boots rind uniforms
among the stores, of which the whole
army was in need, arrived from Eu
rope four days "before the Russian re
tirement from Mukden.
General Kuropatkin ordered the re
moval of the stores, but his order was
not executed. An investigation will
be made to establish the responsibility.

SCORES BRITISH PRESS.
Russian Financial Agent Denounces
English Editors.
LONDON, March 28. â Routkowsky,
the Russian financial agent in Lon
don, has sent a long letter to the Lon
don newspapers protesting vigorously
against what he calls the deliberate
campaign carried on the past three
years not only by the British press
but also through journals connected
with the British press In America and
in France, to damage Russian credit
by predicting insolvency and revolu
tion. The letter says:
Millions of families in Europe have in
vested the saving's of a lifetime in Russian
securities and would be ruined by the sale of
the bonds in a panic. It is criminal to at
tempt to ruin sUch people by misstatements
and misrepresentations, and In anj- individual
case any court of law would award damages
to the sufferers.

TWO SUICIDES
IN A HOTEL
â , â
CLEVELAND. Ohio. . March 28.
Henry L. Woodtvard. formerly an at
torney of New York, aVid Charles A.
Brouse of U'adsworth, Ohio, a trav
eling salesman, committed suicide in
their rooms at the Hotel Hollenden
during last night or to-day. The bod
ies of both men were found thist aft
ernoon. The Coroners verdict in each
case gives despondency over domestic
and business troubles as the cause of
the suicide. Each man had used a
pistol and had sent a bullet into his
head in almost the same spot, death in
each case being instantaneous. So far
a*= Is known there was no agreement
between the men to end their lives.
Coroner Siegelstein said that a
number of letters had been found in
Woodward's possession from his wife
which showed that Woodward evi
dently had been suffering from de
spondency. The letters were affec
tionate in tone and pleaded for Wood
ward'o return home and for a reply to
the letter?. Woodward was* an attor
ney and had been in partnership with
Robert P. Cummings at 315 Liberty
street. Xew York. The partnership
had been dissolved some time ago and
Woodward became a traveling sales
man for a law publishing company.
Woodward was a brother of Justice
John K. Woodward, of the New York
Supreme Court and a brother-in-law
of Steven A. Stranahan, collector of
the port of New York.

JAPANESE WAR
LOAN OFFERED
Local Banks Have Handling
of Financial Matter in
Pacific Coast Territory
To-day at 10 a. m. in this city and
also in London, New York, Montreal,
Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and St.
I Louis, subscriptions will be taken for \
i the Imperial Japanese Government 4^
I per cent loan to the amount of
â  $150,000,000. One-half of the amount'
will ho placed in Europe and one-half i
;in the United States. In this city the :
subscriptions will be received by the :
Nevada National Bank of San Fran- '

The loan is announced to be payable !
at par on February. 15, 1925.. Any and !
all of the bonds can be withdrawn at ;
: any time after February 15, 1910, on j

cured by a first charge on the annual
ret revenue of the Imperial Japanese
Government tobacco monopoly.
The Japanese Government has the
exclusive right to control the cultiva
tion- and production of the leaf in Ja
i'pan and to purchase, import, manufac
1 ture and sell tobacco. It thus possesses
; the entire monopoly of the tobacco
trade within the limits of the Japanese
I empire. The net revenue for the fiscal
year 1905-6 is estimated by the vice
governor of the Bank of Japan, the
duly authorized special financial com
missioner of the Japanese Government,
at 3,267,796 pounds. The bonds are of
fered at 87^ per cent of their face ;
value. I
The bankers in this city who will re- |
I ceive subscriptions for the loan say
that the events of the Japanese-Rus- ;
sian war have given greater confidence ;

I readily.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 28.â The .
Standard , Oil ; Company is to undergo
a Grand j Jury investigation by . the
Federal Government such as the beef
trust; is now burdened with in Chi
cago. The oil trust investigation is to
take place â¢in Topeka, ' according to 'a '
Government official here, and to :
begin within two weeks. Incidentally
the railroads ". are to (be dragged in. ' :
; A Grand Jury was drawn at Topeka
; to-day, ostensibly.; to - look after , th.c .
regular . criminal business â of ; the â¢
Kansas Federal ; Court, . but its chief
task is "to investigate Standard Oil
methods- ' Great secrecy is maintained
in .'regard to 'the matter. ; The names â¢,
of the jurors will not. be given, out. : ;
â¢ The Government figures that there is i
no chance for a trust to fix a ; juryman ;
in advance if the ' trust doesn't know:
who the juryman is. 'â â¢'â â â 
Commissioner Garfleld will aid in the j
Grand . Jury I investigation in Kansas..
For the last three weeks the Depart
ment of Comrnercte has had Secret
Service men in the oil country gather- ,
ing information as to trust methods. j
One of the questions to be investigated i
is why the Standard dropped the price
of crude oil almost 50 per cent without
dropping the price of. refined oil. An
other is why the railroads lifted freight
rates on crude oil as soon as the trust
opened its pipe line to Kansas City. j
I The Government expects to show a
conspiracy between the Standard and
the railroads for the. control of the oil
market.
. "The Department 'of Justice is ' not
looking ; for some insignificant clerk or
bookkeeper to punish," said the official
who gave the above information "It
is looking: for bigger game. There I
will be no whitewash used. The de
partment is out for blood." ' ,

President E. P. Ripley of the Santa Fe

GRAPPLES WITH
MEAT COMBINE
Joseph Seyner, who conducts a
butcher business at 218 Sixth street, has
grappled with the Butchers' Boar^ of
Trade of San Francisco and Alameda
County, which he alleges bears all of
the earmarks of a trust. He filed suit
yesterday against the board for $10,
000 damages arid a perpetual injunc
tion restraining it from carrying on a
"boycott against his business because
he refuses to purchase meats for re
tail solely from members of the de
fendant association.
Seyner alleges that the association, i
the officers of which are J. H. Me
fctenomy, J. M Gilbert, D. A. Hunte- j
man and Louis Nonnenmann, is an un- :
lawful conspiracy maintained to en- '
force arbitrary restrictions upon its i
, members and to harass those that re- j
: fuse to Join the same. It seeks to con
j trol the slaughtering, wholesale and |
retail branches of the trade, plaintiff |
alleges, and in fact now controls the |
business, compelling its members to j
deal with none outside of the associa
tion, even though more than 10 per
; jcent: of its members object to such ar
i ibitrary conduct.
Continuing, Seyner alleges he
! purchased the business he now con- i
! ducts at a cost of $5000, and finally, in
August, 1892, was forced to become a
'member of the association. In March
of 1893, while still -a member of the as- ;
,isociation, he purchased meat from the
Great Western Meat Company, a non
imetnber, and was promptly fined $50
"iby the association. At that time he
ftlesjrpd to withdraw from the asso
ciation, he said, but was intimidated
t^nd compelled to retain his member
j ship. He therefore paid the fine, but in
! January of 1904 he was again fined $50
j for the same offense- This fine he paid,
; and another fine of $250 imposed upon
him for Belling meat to the Co-oper- .
! ative Meat Company of Oakland he
*Uso paid. On January 21, 1905, he saya,
;he contracted with Wacker & John for
supplies of meat and upon learning of
;<the fact the association imposed an
other fine of $250 upon him.
This fine, he says, he refused to pay,
i with the result that on February 8
last the association declared a boycott
against him. On February 14 he with
drew from the association, but the
boycott against him was continued.
â¢He now asks that an injunction issue
against the association restraining it
â  from further interferenc* with his
; business, that it be compelled to return
to him the $300 fines he paid and give
him $10,000 damages.

INVESTIGATION
OF LAND OFFICE
Secretary Hitchcock Plans
Sweeping Inquiry Into
the Methods of Officials
GRAVE CHARGES MADE
Facts Learned in Connection
With Oregon Frauds Im
plicate Men in Washington
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDIXG,
WASHINGTON. March 28.â Secretary
Hitchcock is planning a careful and
extensive investigation "of the General
Land Office. It will be begun- as spon
as the work of collecting evidence in
the Oregon !and fraud cases is com
pleted and other urgent matters are
out ot tht> way. The investigation will
cover a wide scope, including not only
the methods of administering the Land
Office, but the personnel of the office
as well The manner of making pro
motions will be probed.
. It is alleged that there is a certain
clique or combination of a bipartisan
character which has arrogated to itself
the right to arrange promotions, and
that this arrangement originated while
Binger Herrmann was Land Commis
sioner. No one. it is said, who does not
wear the stamp of approval of this
combine has been able to progress.
Another charge is that Chief Clerk
J. T. Maoty, a .Ne?v Yorker, has been
using the' clerical force in preparing
political speeches for Congressmen.
Macey y admirs-th.at considerable "politi
cal correspondence" has been handled
by him. but denies that he ever pre
pared political speeches, using the of
fice force.
One of the most serious accusations
is that the fclerks In the office were
practically, held up and required to con
tribute to a ihOO fund to buy a wedding
present for former Chief Clerk Metzger,
a Missouri man. Macey and A. C.
Shaw, now Chief of the Public Lands
Division, it is said, solicited the money
in such a way that the clerks knew it
was to their best interest to subscribe.
It was in preparing evidence for the
trial of the land fraud cases that Hitch
cock came upon additional matters
which eeenied to him to call for
a searching Investigation of the Land
Office.
NEW LOURDES
FOR VATICAN
ROME, March 28. â Above the grot
to which stands before the famous
tower of Leo IV in the Vatican gar
| dens, where the late Pope spent his
summers has been built an exact fac
simile of the basilica of Lourdes,
! which was solemnly blessed by Pope
;^ius X to-day in the presence of a
1 ."large assemblage. The expenses were
covered by a subscription opened in
France by the Bishop of Tarbes. The
facade of the basilica is decorated
'with portraits of Pius IX, Leo XIII
and the Bishop of Tarbes in imitation
: mosaic.
The Pope arrived on the spot in a
â  carriage escorted by noble guards in
brilliant uniforms and was received by
, the papal court, which made a strik
ing picture with the gorgeous cos
tumes in the blazing sun. The Pon
tiff, who was warmly cheered, as
! sumed the pontifical robes and pro-
I reeded immediately with the cere
i mony of blessing the basilica, which
| was most brief. Afterward the Pope
i imparted the apostolic blessing to the
10,000 persons present, including
about 760 Americans, paying special
attention to the French pilgrimage,
which came to Rome under the lead
ership of the Bishop of Tarbes on pur
pose to be present at the ceremony.
The Pope showed great satisfaction
at to-day's function. He said that all
his life he had desired to visit Lour
des, but had always been prevented.
As he was now in the Vatican as Pope
it was out of the question to go there.
| Therefore he was most pleased to
! have a reproduction of the basilica of
Lourdes. in the gardens.
The. Bishop of Tarbes collected
i $16,000 to defray the expenses of the
! work.
The Overdue List.
The British steamer Canada Cap*, which
was placed on the overdue list at 5 per cent.

FOLK PLEADS
FOR THE LAW
Says Bad Statutes Should
Be Repealed and Not Ig
nored as Is the Custom
PATRIOTISM OF PEACE
He Asserts Good Government
Needs 3len Who Will Live
for the City and State
NEW YORK. March 28. â Governor
Joseph W. Folk of Missouri was the
guest of honor and the principal
speaker at the banquet of the Missou
ri Society at /.he Waldorf-Astoria to
night. In a brief address Governor
Folk said:
':â¢ The Missouri, idea. means the enforcement of
law.' and. that if the i law be bad the remedy is
to repeal r It, not to Ignore it. There is entirely
too little "respect â  for- law in America. In
every State we find laws a nullity for policy's
sake. v > Such a thing is- unknown In any other
land. Disregard -.of * on? law breeds disre
spect for all "laws.,- In allowing some laws to
go -. unenfotced. we - reap a harvest In having
all laws' broken. The law may not be to
one's liking, but the answer "It Is the law"
should' be sufficient for the law-abiding. Good
nien will observe even bad laws, but bad men
will break even good laws, It should be that
all men should be compelled to keep all law,
good &nd bad. because it is tha law.
How careless people usually are as to wheth
er laws are enforced or not. This lethargy
gives rise to civic evils. Indeed, nearly all
public wrongs grow out of the Indifference of
the people. There, are many who thrill with
patriotic fervor at the thought of going to
war and risking thÂ«4r llvÂ«Â« for their country,
hot who forget to vote on election day. The
patriotism of peace tÂ« Just a* necem&ry &j> the
patriotism of war. The patriotism of the ballot
is even more necessary in a free country
than the patriotism of a bullet. Plenty of
men will die for thetr country, bat the man
who will live for his city and State every day
Is the man good government needs.
District Attorney Jerome said:
I do not want to belittle what Governor Folk
has done, but tt is a fact that nothing hÂ« has
done can be compared to what he may do and
may be. Whatever Folk has accomplished as
Circuit Attorney and Governor, one ot th*
greatest things he has done was to put cour
age into the hearts of thousands who never
knew hmi. That will be the monument to his
life. There are four men to-day on whom
the attention of the United States Is riveted â
Roosevelt, La Follette. Deneen and Folk. TTiese
men have had the plain people behind them
and will continue to have them so long as the
people believe they stand on their honÂ«Â«ty.
RISING AGALVST MORALES.
Revolution Starts and America Will
Aid in Suppressing It.
CAPE HAYTIEN. Hayti. March 28.â
A dispatch received here by courier
from Monte Cristi, on the northern
coast of the republic of Santo Do
mingo, to-day announces that General
Barbaa, with a number of Dominican
exiles, has landed at Monte Crlstl and
that the inhabitants have risen against
President Morales, reproaching him
with having been the cause of the pres
ent difficulties with foreign countries.
It is added that the district of Monte
Cristi is ready to begin a revolution
in favor of former President Jlminez
and is only awaiting the sign to take
arms.
WASHINGTON, March 28.âIntima
tions of a projected movement against
President Morales of Santo Domingo,
fomented by exiles from that country,
reached the State Department several
days ago. The affair, however, is not
giving the officials here any uneasiness,
as they now feel free, in view of Presi
dent Roosevelt's acceptance of th*
Governments proposition to control
the finances of that country, to assist â
and. it is said, will assist â President
Morales, If requested by the latter. In
putting down any movement which Is
a menace to its best Interests.
It Is understood that General Barbaa
and those who are with him have been
on the island of Porto Rico. Their
movements were known to the State
Department and when they left that
place several days ago their departure
was promptly reported to Washington.
The district of Monte Cristi is said to
be the hotbed of the revolutionists in
Santo Domingo, and it was believed
Barbaa and his associates would head
for that section. Their reported ar
rival there, cimsequently. caused no
great surprise ' to the Washington
officials.
The Navy Department has several
vessels in Dominican waters, and.
under directions from the State De
partment, if requested to do so by
President Morales, will lend Its co
operation in preserving the peace of
the country, so that its finances may
be restored to a settled condition.

SECRET ACTION
A\ ithhold Until To-Day the
Decision Concerning Rock
efellers $100,000 Donation
(tLADDEX FILES PROTEST
i laims the Foreign Missions
Board Has No Right
to Accept the Money
BOSTON. March Positive action
was taken on the Question of accept
ing John D. Rockefeller's gift of
$100,000 to the American Board of Com
missioners for Foreign Missions at a
meeting- this afternoon of the pruden
tial committee of that organization,
but the nature of the action was not
disclosed- The committee announced
officially, however, that a statement
reciting the decision of the committee
would be given out to-morrow after
the report adopted, which is in the
form of resolutions, had been officially
communicated to a committee appoint
ed at a meeting of Congregational
clergymen of Boston and vicinity to
protest against the acceptance of the
Rockefeller gift.
Dr. James L. Barton, foreign secre
tary of the American board, said to
day that already $41,500 of the gift
was in the treasury and the question
to be decided at to-day's meeting was
therefore whether this amount should
|be returned or whether it should be
retained and the balance accepted.
; Before the meeting of the committee
the opinion was expressed at Congre
gational headquarters that the gift
"would be accepted. It was said that
the amount already drawn from
Rockefeller had been apportioned by
the American board for colleges in
Japan, India and Turkey.
DR. GLADDENS PROTEST.
Dr. Washington Gladdens protest to
the American board against the ac
ceptance of the gift of $100,000 from
John D. Rockefeller is as follows:
I must ask the privilege of expressing as
explicitly as I can my surprise and regret
ttKt the officer* of the American board have
accepted a large sum cf money from John
D. Rockefeller, I object to this, because the
zaaney thus â  â¢ wed does not rightfully be
long to the man wha rives â ': it has be^a
Cag-ttlously acquired and ell the world
k:iows it.
It may be difficult in many cases to Judge
ef the methods by which wealth has been
gained. The operations are complex and we
ir.ay be !a doubt respecting their honesty.
Thus, it is no doubt impracticable to under
take the investigation of the sources of all
gifts that are offered ue. But when the in
\<?Â£tiÂ£Â«tion has been thoroughly made and the
case is clear â we ere bound to guide our
conduct by the fact* made known.
In this case the Investigation has been
thoroughly ciade and tiie facts are known.
The legislative inquiries and the records of the
courts have Circa tae reading people of this
country the materials for a judgment upon
the methods of the Standard Oil Company
and there never was a clay when their minds
were as clear on this subject as they are
now. They knew that this great power has
b^Â«n built up by injustice and oppression;
they know that itÂ« immense gains have been
â  mad* by forcibly despoiling citizens of their
honest gei::s and shutting the doors of op
portunity upon them.
NOT ROCKEFELLER'S .MONEY.
It has been forcibly done, I say; 'â  has
b-^n largely done through illicit and In
:-<uitous control Â«f railways. Standard Oil
has never ceased -to use this power ia this
â¢ray. It is using .t to-day as effectively as
ti ever did.
Mr. Rockefeller may deny that rebates are
new givon to the Standard OH. bill the
Standard Ol! r.orr c.'ntrcls about two-thirds
of the xaiircads o* this country and tts potrer
is exerted in f.xisg the classification of freight*
in such a way thai it can kill competition.
, Rebates are no longer necessary. Thue thia
stupendous power, which owes its existence
to a shameful prostitution of agencies created
fey the public fcr the public service Is now
tble to lay its paralyzing hand upon all the.
industries of the nation and to force them
to contribute to its enormous revenues.
And this is the money which is offered to
th*Â» American board. We have no right to
take it. It does not beiens to the man who
offers it. It belongs to the people from whom
It ha- be<>n extorted.
It is often assumed. I fear, that we do
not need to be overscrupu'ous about money
which we can use in "doing good." That
lndiJTerer.ee is deadly. The "good" that is
done by lowering our ethical standards might
bc-tter be left undone. Shall the young men
â¢rd women of the missionary colleges be
tr ur'r: to regard Mr. Rockefeller as a great
benefactor? The colleges might better be per
iranently closed.
The American board also has re
ceived a communication from Rev. A.
H. Bradford of Montclair. N. J, for
mer moderator of the National Congre
gational Council and president of the
American Missionary Association, who
favors the acceptance of Rockefeller's
gift.

MAINE BLOWS UP BY CUBAN
SYMPATHIZERS, HE SAYS.

GESSLER ROSSEAC. WHO SATS HE MADE THE INTKuNAL MACHINE WHICH
DESTROVKD THE MAINE. HE ADDS THE r-K~V WAS DONE UT A CT'BAN
SYMPATHIZER, WHO MISTOOK THE VEPSKL TOR A SPANISH SHIP.
NEW YORK, March 28 âThat the
battleship Maine through an error was
destroyed Â«y a bomb of his manufac
ture was the statement made by Gess
: ler BoSwCtta in the Tombs prison to
day. Rosseau \sas convicted yesterday
of having sent explosives to the
Cunard line pier in this city in May.
1903. He made the following statement
to-day â¢
"For several j'ears while the Cuban
patriots were Fcruggling against V\"ey
ler I watched the contest with deep in
terest and sympathy. I decided to go
to Jacksonville and do what I could to
assist the re%olutionists. I started
from St. I/OuiE, where I had been living
during the early part of 189.'.
"Before taking a train for the South
I got together the material for the con
struction of two exploding machines of
tremendous power, so arranged that
; they could be wound up and left in a
j selected place, with the certainty that
they would go off and cause terrible
: destruction within a few hours.
"At New Oceans I rented a room
and put the boxes together, after
which I went to Jacksonville. There I
bfrcamc acquainted with a party of Cu
ban leaders, who were planning a fili
bustering expedition. They had en
gaged the Destroyer, a small vessel, to
take them to Cuba, along with a num
ber of American ajid European adven
j turers, who were anxious to strike a
I blow for Cuban freedom.
"Several of the leaders of the party
are men now well known, and I will not
mention their names, although I have
among my papers a list of them all.
"I suggested to them that they use
my machines to destroy Spanish war
ships in the harbor of Havana and in
other ports on the coast of the island.
They readily seized upon the idea, and
when the Destroyer sailed with the fili
busters they took my two machines
with them. It was my intention to go
along with the party so as to direct
the work of sinking the Spanish war
ships, but they dissuaded me, urging
that I could b* of greater use in Jack
sonville preparing other machines if
the first proved successful.
"It was planned to have some mem
bers of the revolutionary party Join
the Spanish navy bo as to get the ma
chines aboard. If that failed it was
decided to fasten one of the bombs to
the hull of a ship under the water
line, for I had constructed the ma
chines so they could be exploded un
der the water. That was late in the
fall of 1897. The next spring the Maine
was destroyed. Only one man in the
secret of the machines returned to \
America. I saw him some time after
the war with Spain had begun. He told
me he had had nothing to do with the I
boxen after reaching Cuba, but had |
been told that a mistake had been i
made.
"The man who had been intrusted \
with the task of destroying a Span- I
lsh vessel attempted to fasten a box !
during the night to one of Alfonso's \
warships, and blundered into blowing ;
up th*Â» Maine. I was told that the man, j
immediately after learning of the error j
he had made, committed suicide."
Rosseau said he had attempted to '
blow up the ytatue of Frederick the I
Great at Washington because he did ',
not wish to Â»cc the statue of a King
in Amerirp. He added that he was not ]
an Anarchist or a Nihilist, and that he i
had mi;de no effort to supply explod- j
ing machines to the Russians.

FROG LEGS
SOT RATED
AS TURKEY
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
WASHINGTON, March 28.â After
considering the matter for nearly a
year the board of appraisers of the
customs branch of the Treasury De
partment has decided that frogs' legs
are not turkey.
A year ago a New York firm imported
a lot of frogs' legs. As the commodity
of frogs' legs does not appear in the
Dingiey tariff, the Treasury Depart
ment ordered that they be classed as
turkey, and a duty of 5 cents a pound
was laid upon them. The importers
demurred and appealed to the board of
appraisers. This board, at its recent
meeting here, decided that frogs' legs
are not turkey, but that they are a
"non-essential manufactured articles,"
and as such will pay a duty of 5 per
cent ad valorem just the same.

WHEAT FIELDS
IN A BAD WAY
Crops in the United States
Falling Off in Quantity
and Quality, Says Wilson
MUST HELP THE LAND
Secretary of Agriculture
Has on Foot a Plan for
a Rotation of Products
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. March 28. â "Our
great wheat fields along the northern
border are refusing to grow wheat,"
sand James Wilson. Secretary of Agri
culture, to-day. "And unless Ameri
can farmers change their method of
growing this product there will be a
large increase in the price of bread
stuffs. The evil day canhot long be
postponed, notwithstanding the fact
that the famers of the Northwest be
lieve they have solved the problem by
permitting their lands to lie fallow for
one year and thus growing a crop of
wheat every other year.
"At present the average production
of wheat to the acre is eight bushels,
while in Europe the farmers grow
thirty. Last year the American wheat
crop was sickly, and this indicates that
the land refuses to grow wheat any
longer on a profitable basis. In order
to save the wheat fields of the United
States we have sent an expert to the
northern part of Norway and Sweden
to find legumes which, will grow in cold
climates. If the wheat farmers of the
Northwest expect to grow wheat at a
profit they must rotate their crops. At
present we have no leguminous plants
which will grow in the Northwest that
can be rotated with wheat.
"With a continued decrease in the
yield in the Northwest the farmers of
lowa, Illinois. Kansas and Nebraska
will begin to grow wheat again, but
they will not do so until they can get
at least a dollar a bushel for it."

The body of the late envoy was car

body bearers, the casket, wrapped In
the Mexican flag, was taken to the foot

ot the Embassador's family and ex-
Secretary of State and Mrs. John W.
Foster. Fastened to the top of the
casket were the chapeau and sword of
the dead envoy.
The services were brief, the Rev.
Father Buckley officiating, and con
sisted of a requiem mass and several
prayers for the dead.

cepted the offer of a warship, and the
body will be carried on the cruiser Co

F. M. CAMPBELL
DIES SUDDENLY
IN WASHINGTON
OAKLAND, March 28.â Word was re
ceived here to-night that Fred M.
Campbell had died suddenly In Wash
ington, D. C. No details are given,
but he Buffered a paralytic stroke
something over a year ago, and prob
ably a similar stroke caused his death.
Mr. Campbell was well known
throughout the State as an educator,
particularly in the early years of Oak
land's schools. He was elected State
Superintendent of Schools in 1879, and
was for years City Superintendent of
Schools of Oakland. He was a friend
of Secretary Metcalf of the Cabinet,
and when Mr. Metcalf was Congress
man Mr. Campbell acted as his secre
tary and of late had been connected
with the public service in Washington.
He was elected president of the Na
tional Educational Association in 1888,
when It held its great convention in
San Francisco. He was also the or
ganizer of the Quarter Century Re
publican Club of Oakland.
On August 17, 1904, while at his resi
dence at 1262 Webster street, Mr.
Campbell was stricken with paralysis
and grave fears were felt as to his
condition. He gradually recovered
from the shock, however.
About the time that the shock oc
curred he was engaged to marry Mrs.
H. M. L. Walker, formerly of Hono
lulu. The engagement had been an
nounced and the wedding was to have
taken place in November. In Decem
ber the couple were married and she
survives him. Mr. Campbell also
loaves a grown family In this city.

"NOT GUILTY,"
JUKI'S VERDICT
Special DUpatch to ThÂ« Call.
NAPA. March 28.â After deliberating
thirty minutes the Jury before which
T. D. Shanahan and Oscar Retzman
were tried on a charge of murdering
Patient Luis at the Napa State Hos
pital for the Insane last December re
turned a verdict of not guilty. The de
fendants are attendants at the hospital.
Patient Luis was a maniac, pos
sessed of great strength. He was sub
ject to attacks of epilepsy. Last Christ
mas day he attacked Retzman in ward
B of the asylum. Retzman called for
help and Shanahan responded. After
a struggle in which Luis was heavily
thrown the lunatic was finally subdued.
He died a few hours later and a charge
of murder was placed against the two
attendants. The fact that Luis' body
was badly bruised and several of his
ribs broken caused the accusation.
The evidence heard at the trial of
Shanahan and Retzman, however,
showed that Luis' death was due to
epilepsy. His ribs were broken when
he fell in the struggle in the ward. The
bruises were caused by the pressure
of the straps with which he had been
restrained.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 28.â For the purpose
of determining whether Fort McPher
son, on the Mackenzie River, can be
reached from Dawson during the win
ter In case of an emergency, a special
patrol of Northwest mounted police has
just made a trip involving more than
one thousand miles of winter traveling
with thÂ« thermometer between 50 and
60 degrees below zero during most of
the journey."
The trip was one of the most re
markable tver made in the Arctic
regions, the trail having never bÂ«forÂ«

tance after leaving the Yukon on snow
shoes. They reached Fort McPherson
thirty-eight days out, returning In
twenty- five days.
Many blizxards were encountered
during the trip. Their food gave out
and men and dogs were compelled to
live on dried fish for several days.

FOR HEAVY HAUL.
Lining of Her Gown Is Used

Large and V aried Assortment
of Plunder Recovered.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
One of the argus-eyed sleuths em
ployed at the Emporium noticed that
Mrs. E. Peterson's lower circumfer
ence gradually increased as she flitted
from counter to counter and fingered
â M merchandise thereon displayed,
arid with suspicion aroused he decided
to shadow and sharply watch her. He
soon discovered that although she
IBt purchase anything the infla
tion of her skirt continued, so he
â  y escorted her to the searching
room and there had his suspicion
more than amply confirmed. Lining I
the woman's dress was a vast pocket, '
from which the following aticles were â¢
abstracted:
Tuo pairs of corsets, nine pair* of atockraca.
five waist t.e!;*. ihr^e undervÂ«ats. two volumes
c? the complete work* of Mark Twain, one j
.are* t*Â±>le cloth, one Quart bottle of whisky.
Yet the capacious receptacle was ;
not more than half filled by the plun
der described, and as she had visited
only â  few of the departments when i
her arrest was effected, the special po- \
liceman opined that he nipped her pil- j
fering tour almost in its bud. When
he tapped her shoulder and requested j
faer to follow his lead, she was headed i
for the household furniture section of
Hill general store and he face
tiously opined that if- she had not
been halted right there and then a
chiffonier or a bedstead would have
been added to her stolen possessions.
In the court of Police Judge Conlan
she wore a large crimson hat and a
yellow-fronted blue vest, and her
empty pocket-skirt, hung as loosely as
the garments of Comedian Dill when
he emerges from the thinning-room
In "The Beauty Shop." She looked to
bar about 60 years of age and in a dia
lect betraying British nativity she re
quested the court to "let her down
heaEy/'c as it was her first larcenous
offense. Â°
"I can hardly believe you." said his
Honor. "That pocket arrangement In
dicates you were constantly equipped
! to, steal and hide your plunder."
' W'y. bless yer koind 'art," she re
sponded, "I made thatyer pocket to
carry laundry in."
':.. you're a washer lady?" ven
tured the Judge.
"Not much, I hain't," was her in
dignant retort- "Wen I soys laun
dry I means me own linen that I
toikes to a Chinaman to wash."
"Well, you will do your own wash
ing for four months from this date.
and the County Jail will be your scene
of operations."

o A GOOD DEAL OF NONSENSE
About "Blood Purifiers" and "Tonics."
Every drop of blood, every bone,
rerve and tissue In the body can be
renewed in but one way, and that is,
from wholesome food properly digest-
ed. There Is no other way and the idea
that a. medicine in itself can purify the
blood or supply new tissues and strong
Tierves is ridiculous and on a par with
the 01-de-rol that dyspepsia or indi-
gestion is a germ disease, or that other
fallacy, that a weak stomach which re-
fuses to digest food can be made to do
c bo by irritating and inflaming the bow-
els by pills and cathartics.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure in-
digestion, sour stomach, gas and bloat-
ing after meals, because they furnish
the digestive principles which weak
stomachs lack, and, unless the defi-
ciency of pepsin and diastase is sup-
plied, it is useless to attempt to cure
stomach trouble by the use of "ton-
ic?," "pills" and "cathartics" which
have absolutely no digestive power,
and their only effect Is to give a tem-
porary stimulation.
One grain of the active principle In
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest
3000 grains of meat, eggs and similar
foods, and - experiments have Ehown
tnat they will do this In a glass bot-
tle at proper temperature, but of
course are much more effective in the
stomach.
Trier- is probably no remedy so uni-
versally used as Stuart's Tablets, be-
cause It is not only the sick and; ailing,
but well people who use them at every
meal to insure "perfect digestion "and
assimilation of food.
People who enjoy fair health take
Stuart's Tablets as regularly as they
take their meals, because they want to
keep well, prevention is better than
cure, and Stuart's ' Dyspepsia Tablets
do both; they prevent indigestion and
they â¢ remove it where It V exists. The
regular use of one or two of them after
meals will demonstrate their merit and
efficiency better than any other argu-
ment.

She did not seem to be dismayed by
the sentence.
Mrs. Hattie Grote of 1103 Santa Fe
avenue, Oakland, was also accused of
shoplifting, and Judge Cabaniss heard
the testimony and pronounced her
guilty as charged. When arrested in
the store of Hale Bros, she had con
cealed on her person six bunches of
artificial flowers and two coils of
clothesline, which she had just pil
fered, and in court she did not at
tempt to deny her guilt or to offer
explanation aÂ« to why she had stolen
the goods. She is the wife of an in
dustrious carpenter and the mother of
three bright children. It was intimat
ed that an inordinate love of flnery
impelled her to purloin, but the Judge
said he was unable to understand how
clotheslines coula be rated as articles
of feminine apparel, and then in turn
intimated that he will impose a fine of
$60 when the weak-willed woman ap
pears for sentence this morning.
Seventeen-year-old Freda Dearman,
charged with vagrancy, told Judge Mo
gan that if she were convicted the blow
would kill mother.
"She thinks I'm a good girl," ex
plained Miss Dearman, "and if she
finds out that I have been disobedient
the disgrace will send her to her grave.
It's not for myself I'm pleading, but
the life of a kind and trusting mother."
His Honor was palpably Inclined to
leniency until the disclosure came that
the defendant's maternal relative, a re
spectable resident of South San Fran
cisco, had abandoned effort to reform
her after twice compassing her arrest
for waywardness. So the girl was
promptly pronounced guilty and in
formed that she may be sent to an in
stitution for the disciplining of in
corrigibles.
"Oh. gick:" she exclaimed, dis
gustedly.

As like as the proverbial two peas in
a pod were the Misses Addle and Aileen
Conboy as they stood before Judge Mo
gan and vehemently denied Mrs. Wil
helmlna Chapius' accusation that
they had disturbed her neace.
They were tall and willowy of
form and their tight-fitting blue silk
gowns and waists and yellow satin
neckties and white chiffon hats, heavily
banked with vari -colored roses, were
exact counterparts. Yet they were not
twins. Aileen confessed to having been
born two years prior to Addie's arrival
on this sphere.
Supporting the cause of Mrs. Chapius,
who dwells at 321 Eureka street, next
door to the home of the defendants,
were Mrs. Daly. Mrs. Frank. Mrs.
Suren and Mrs. Filisetti. all of whom
testified that the two Conboy girls
â were common scolds and constant men
aces to the peace of a highly re
spÂ«?ctable neighborhood. Mrs. Chapius
averred that every time she put her
nose outside her door she was orally
abused by Miss Aileen or Miss Addle,
or by both in unison, although she had
done nothing to provoke their ire.
With facitl expression indicative of
horror, pity, contempt and several
other emotions, the defendants, seated
Fide by side, hearkened to the prose
cution, occasionally looking at each
other, shaking their heads commlser
atingly and audibly exchanging such
comment as "Did you ever?" "How
can she?" "Ain't that the limit?"
varying the Intelligible criticism by
sharply clicking their tongues In the
way ladles do when their astonish
ment is too profound for utterance.
The defense was an unqualified denial
of every accusation contained in the
complaint and adduced in testimony.
Their arrest was a "put-up Job," they
declared â a deep-seated conspiracy
to oust them from a vicinity !n which
they had declined to become popular
because they considered themselves of
higher social caste than any of their
neighbors. As for demeaning them
selves by voicing the language alleged
by the prosecutrix, they would just as
soon think of associating with her or
any of her friends. Their father, em
ployed by the Southern Pacific, cor
roborated their views as to the motive
of the prosecution, as did their broth
er, an attache of the telephone com
pany. And a little auburn-haired ma
tron, name not called, was feverishly
eager to back the defense, and did
succeed in launching her sentiments
at the bench, although she was not
Eummoned to do so.
It looked like dismissal with a repri
mand for the Conboy sisters when
Patrolman Stanton, whose sobriquet
is "Castle Garden." voluntarily in
formed the court that they had been
arrested on two previous occasions
and charged with drunkenness and
disorderly behavior, and that on one
of the occasions he was compelled to
tie the elder Miss Conboy to a fence
post while he undertook the subju
gation of the younger. On the other
occasion Patrolmen "Jerry" Nyhen
figured as the peace guardian. So the
Judge pronounced the Conboy sisters
guilty as charged and ordered them to
appear for' sentence to-day.

Mrs. Stratton on Becoming
Wife of "Biondie" Cooksie
Gives Him a Fortune
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
DENVER, March 28.â Has Mrs. Mary
E. Stratton, beautiful, wealthy, re
fined, fallen victim to the hynotic arts
of "Blondie" M. Cooksie, the prize
fighter? Mrs. Stratton last evening
took the ring gladiator for her second
husband. Immediately after the cere
mony she presented her pugilistic
spouse with a bill of sale for the finest
restaurant in Seattle. Then she poured
money into the pockets of "Blondie"
and sent him forth to give largess to
the gamins. Finally she secured a com
partment in a sleeper, two tickets to
Seattle and departed with her new
lord.
Five years ago "Blondie" Cooksie
was an itinerant hypnotist. He trav
eled aJI over the West and gave exhi
bitions of throwing himself into a sup
posed cataleptic trance. In a confes
sion written for a local magazine he
admits that he was one of the most
arrant fakers that ever took the dol
lars of the trusting.
Mrs. Stratton is a linguist and an
accomplished musician. She has lived
all her life amid surroundings of cul
ture. Her alms are high and her ideals
of the best. "Blondie" has been a suc
cessful barber, hypnotic subject, light
weight fighter and waiter. His has
been the hand to mouth existence of
sporting men. His language smacks
of the curb. How, then, ask those who
know Mrs. Stratton, could she have
been attracted to "Blondie"? They an
swer their own question thus: "She
must have been hypnotized."
Mrs. Stratton's first husband was a
young society blood of the Pacific
Coast, who. died in Seattle about two
years ago from the effects of an auto
mobile accident near Los Angeles. He
was the son of wealthy people, who
established him in business as an archi
tect in San Francisco.

court," repeatedly bellowed the bailiff
in the corridor, but there was no re

bench warrant to issue for the com
plainant's production in court this
morning. When the arresting police
man gave her address as S3 Spofford
alley the clerk remarked she must feel
homesick residing amid a nest of Jap
anese and not ultra-respectable Jap
anese at that, to which the policeman
rejoined that as she herself was a Jap
anese she probably did not suffer with
nostalgia.
"What's that?" exclaimed the Judge.
j-"Mary Magee a Jap?"
"That's what," was the officer's
stolid reply.
An inspection of the signature on the
formal complaint baffled all efforts to
decipher It as anything else than
"Mary Magee" until the Japanese in
terpreter opportunely dropped In and
promptly spelled it "M-a-r-i M-a-j-e-i."

LAND FLOODED
BY BAD BILLS
Gang Operates in All the
Big Cities of the Country
With Counterfeiting Game
AGENTS OX THE TBACK:
Denver Believed to Be the
Headquarters of Men Who
Turn Out Spurious Paper
DENVER, March 28.â A counterfeit
ing scheme, gigantic in its proportions,
which has as its field the whole of the
United States, has just been unearthed
by the Federal authorities. A number
of Government secret service agents
are now in Denver following clews
which are said to have led them to
believe that the headquarters of the
gang are located in this city.
The operations of the counterfeiters
are said to extend all the way from
New York to San Francisco, and so
far it is believed that something like
$50,000 has been secured in the larger
cities of the country.
The counterfeit is one of the best du
plicates of the Buffalo series of $10 and
$20 bills which has ever come to the at
tention of the Federal authorities. A
description of the counterfeits as fur
nished by the United States Secret Ser
vice Department follows: Series 1901,
No. 29513972; face plate, 159; back plate,
87; check letter, D; signed Lyons, reg
ister; Roberts, treasurer; portraits of
Lewis and Clark.
The counterfeits are a shade darker
than the genuine. Secret Service Agent
E. H. Wilson is here working on the
case. Speaking of the counterfeiters'
method of operation he said:
"Their work is so smooth that it is
almost impossible to detect them at it.
Several agents are sent out and pur
chases for small amounts are made in
the stores of the town they are in. A
$10 or $20 bill is presented in payment
and they receive their cash in change.
The counterfeit is not discovered until
it goes to the bank, and even then in a
great many cases it has been allowed
to go through, so perfect is the imita
tion.
"There is not only one gang, but sev
eral of them scattered around over the
country. How many there are in the
deal we cannot tell yet."
MORMONS BUY JAIL WHERE
FIRST PROPHET MET DEATH
Plan of Church to Re-establish in Il
linois May Cause Public Op-
â¢ s^ position.
CARTHAGE, Ills., March 29.âBe
cause of historical associations the
members of the Mormon church have
purchased for $4000 the old jail here
where the old prophet and the
founder of the faith met a tragic
death at the hands of a mob. The old
structure was not worth over $1500.
It is proposed to establish a mission
church in the building.
In this connection announcement
that the Mirraons are coming back to
Illinois after the lapse of half a cen
tury and are to establish three new
churches has caused comment. The
fact that the new church is to make
Carthage a headquarters in Illinois
may be followed by public action in
opposition.
AGED WOMAN STRUCK
WITH AN AX DURING NIGHT
Her Skull Fractured and Her Body
Mutilated by nn Unknown
Person.
OTTAWA, Kans., March 28. â Mrs.
Caroline Jobes, aged 72 years, of
Wellsville, was attacked at the Sem
ple Sanitarium here during the night
by some unknown person and perhaps
fatally wounded. Her skull was frac
tured with an ax and her body was
horribly mutilated. There Is no clew
other than tracks surrounding the
building. The mutilation of the body
was similar to that in the Nickum
murder case at T >peka last year,
when Mrs. Nickum. who kept a board
ing-house, was mysteriously murdered
and the body fearfully slashed. No
motive for the attack upon Mrs. Jobes
is known.
HEART FAILURE CAUSES

SAN DIEGO, March 28. â Robert
Hamilton, one of the best-known men

National City. Heart trouble is be
lieved to have been the cause. Ham
ilton was seventy years old. In early
years he was closely identified with
the business interests of this city.
HE STOPPED
TOO SOON
WÂ« again reiterate that people suffer-
ing; with Bright's Disease or Diabetes
must not stop the treatment immediately
upon the disappearance of the symptoms.
To be safe It should be continued from
two to three months afterward.
Here is a case in point. The moment |
the sugar ceased he dropped the treat-
ment and the diet. Resultâ ln six months
he began to note some return. He now i
goes on the treatment again and will ]
take it till the results are permanent, i
But note the fine results obtained the
first three months when hÂ« ceased the
treatment:
Louisville. Ky., March 15, '05.
Gentlemen: After about eighteen
months' treatment with a first-class phy-
sician here for sugar in urine he aban-
doned the case, stating that he had done
all that medical science knew what to do
in my case. I then began the use of Ful-
ton's Diabetic Compound. This was last
May. I used nine bottles right along and
followed your instructions implicitly, fin-
ishing the last bottle in July, 1904.
I went to the same physician here at
that time, and after a thorough test in
my presence he pronounced the vrine ab-
solutely free of sugar or albumen. Sinoo
then I have taken nothing whatever for
this trouble and have eaten just every-
thing I wanted that was set before me.
Noticing some symptoms of return. I
have just had the doctor make a test.
The specific gravity is 1020, and hÂ« re-
ports there is not the slightest trace of
sugar or albumen, but I thought best to
ask your advice. Yours,
M. J. HARRIS.

BEGIN CRUSADE
AT UNIVERSITY
BERKELEY, March 28.â Thievery Is
declared by college men to be so com
mon at the University of California
that a crusade has been begun by the
newly formed students' affairs commit
tee, with the object of detecting of
fenders, securing their expulsion and
thus raising the moral tone of the col-
I lege. The first step was taken last
j night, when the students' committee
recommended the expulsion of J. A.
Harris, a self-confessed thief, and to
day the campaign was given further
Impetus by Editor J. P. Loeb of the
Daily Californian, the representative
! publication of the student body.
Loeb calls on all students to assist
in the work of purging the university
of thieves and others whose moral
character unfits them for association
with reputable college men and women.
His editorial is as follows:
For the first time the undergraduate ccmmlt
ttÂ» on student affairs has had to judge th; ac
tions of a fellow student and recommend his
expulsion from the university. This first case
was comparatively clear; the culprit confessed,
without any attempt at evasion or denial, that
h-? was guilty as charged, and there was only
one- thing: for the committee to do. Now,
however, they have undertaken a more difficult
task in announcing their intention to start an
aggrebaive campaign against ail stealing in to*
university. It will not be easy to detect tha
offenders, if Indeed there are any left. The
committee can hope for success only If backed
up by the student body. It has asked all vic
tims of thefts to report thÂ«lr losses Immedi
ately. Some people will probably not do so,
either fearing to be called as witnesses, or else
not belnn sufficiently interested in cleaning
out the university to take that little trouble.
If much of that spirit la shown the entire bur
den will rest on the members of the commit
tee and they will probably fall. The theory
of student control is that the entire student
body Is Interested in preserving its own purity.
We must realize this fact and then co-operate.
Loeb is a member of the students' af
fairs committee, which has been dele
gated by the students to act in cases
where disciplinary measures may seem
to be required. His name appeals as
one who signed the report recommend
ing the expulsion of Harris. He printed
an editorial a few days ago which at
tracted attention because of its plain
spoken words, the heading of the ar
ticle being "We Don't Want Thieves."
1 He has been promised co-operation and
support, as has the students' commit
tee, in the work of removing the moral
miasma which has hovered over the
college since Yell Leader Bulkley's
sensational case was made public, and
Harris' confession of theft was wrung
from him by officers of the law.
The disgrace attending the exposure
of these men's wrongdoings, a part of
which the students feel has been re
flected upon their colleges, has made
the great majority of the men and
women in attendance at the State in
stitution determined that the university
shall be purged, and it is promised that
developments may speedily occur cal
culated to rid the colleges of more than
one undesirable, character.

CLASH OCCURS BETWEEN
TWO HOSPITAL OFFICIAL*
Friction Between Warden Fleming
and Superintendent of Xnrses
Settled by Mayor.
A conflict of authority between
Warden Fleming of the City and
County Hospital and Miss Julia M.
Kane. Superintendent of the Nurses'
Training School at the same institu
tion, was deemed of sufficient Import
ance to merit a special conference
yesterday In the Mayor's office. May
or Schmltz and Dr. James W. Ward,
president of the Board of Health,
ware the official arbiters of the differ
ences existing between Fleming and
Miss Kane.
The trouble arose over the Interpre
tation of the rules of the hospital re
lating to the discipline of the nurses.
Miss Kane was of the opinion that
she exercises supreme authority over
them, while Fleming took the stand
that she was amenable to his author
ity as warden of the hospital. After
a long discussion the controversy was
amicably settled to the entlrÂ« satis
faction of both parties concerned.
They were enjoined by the Mr.yor and
Dr. Ward to get along In harmony.

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
ANOTHER PIER
FOR KEY ROUTE
Will Kirn Fiom the Foot of
Twenty-Second Street to
Present Wharf Terminal
MAIN LINK TO OAKLAND
General Offices and Depot
to Be Located in Old San
Pablo Avenue Cable House
OAKLAND, March 28.â The "Key
.Route' has finally decided what.. Its
next move in Oakland will be and
where it will locate its main cross
town line. The new route will be
through Twenty-second street, and
work will be commenced just as soon
as the weather becomes settled, or in
a few weeks, at the most.
A second pier will be run out from
tht foot of Twenty-second street to
Joia the present line at the depot on
the bay. No attempt will be made
to use any of the present pier, as this
is already crowded with the Berkeley
and Piedmont travel. It will be ab
solutely necessary to relieve the con
gestion on th' present pier, and this
can only be done "by diverting the
Oakland travel over another.
The road will * then ' run through
Twenty-second street, which is nearly
straight, and through to Broadway,
where, for the present, it will have its
terminus, though ultimately the Key
Route cars will be run over Adams
Point and into East Oakland and
Fruitvale. At present Twenty-second
street stops at Telegraph avenue, but
a right of way has been recently pur
chased by the Key Route people
through to Broadway. They already
have a line constructed across the head
of Adams Point, which can be used at
any time. This line will pass the old
San Pablo-avenue cable-house, that
was used for the cable machinery when
the San Pablo-avenue line was operat
ed by that method. This building- is
now used as the general offices of the
Key Route system. The plan includes
the reconstruction of this - building,
which is a very solid one, to make it
more available for the general offices.
The permanent headquarters of the
Key Route will be established there,
together with a central depot for
"Oakland travel Another depot will
be erected at Broadway.
This will give a large section of Oak
land that is at present a considerable
distance from both the Key Route at
Fortieth street and the Southern Pa
cific at Fourteenth street, easy com
munication with San Francisco.
Plans are already being perfected for
a fifteen-minute service on the Key
Route, instead of three trips an hour,
as at present. As soon as the ' new
ferry-boat San Francisco is put in
commission fifteen-minute trips will be
made throughout the daytime and
more frequent trips at night. . . - .
TRUSTEES "SHY"
AT NEW CENSES
BERKELEY. March 28.â For reasons
deemed unique, the Board of Trustees
of Berkeley decided last night to re
fuse the request of many citizens that
a new census of the university town
be taken. It was declared by various
members of the board that a new cen
sus would show Berkeley's population
to be about 30,000, and if this was
shown there would be begun at once,
by politicians and others interested an
agitation for providing the town with
new Justice Courts, at least two in
number. With these courts would
come additional court deputies, law
clerks, bailiffs and Judges, all entail
ing an expense which the Trustees ab
hor. â¢JS*Jgg|Sg .--â -...
The laws governing the formation of
Justice Courts would make it manda

the census showing that there are
Â£0.000 persons in Berkeley instead of
15,000 or 'â¢ 20,000, as the population is
now rated by casual calculators.
Trustee Redmond C. Staats, in dis
cussing the matter, said:

ISAAC L. REQUA HAS
PASSED AWAY.
Famous Financier Is No More
Isaac L. Requa, one of the foremost
financiers of the coast and for many
years prominently identified with rail
road building in California, died short
ly after midnight this morning at his
home. The Highlands, on Piedmont
Heights. Oakland.
Death is attributed to nervous col
lapse, which his advanced age could
not withstand. Deceased had been ill
for several weeks, during which his at
tending physicians. Dr. A. Liliencrantz
and Dr. A. S. Larkey, notit-Ad signs of
a general breaking up of their patient's
once strong constitution, and prepared
themselves for the end, which came
this morning.
Few men were probably more widely
known in California than was Isaac
L, Requa, who was a pioneer of the
State, having come around the Horn
in 1850. Arriving in San Francisco he
proceeded immediately to the interior,
where he engaged in mining and met
with success. In 1860 he went to Vir
ginia City, where he was soon actively
engaged in the milling and mining bus
iness, and finally became superintend
ent of the Chollar-Potosi Mining Com
pany and a director in other big min
ing concerns. As a mining engineer
he gained distinction, installing in the
Chollar-Norrrose-Savage shaft the
heaviest machinery used on the Corn
stock.
Returning to California Requa es
tablished his residence in Oakland and
became interested in the big railroad
undertakings of the Huntington, Stan
ford, Crocker and Hopkins combine.
He was president of the Central Pa
cific Railroad Company for many years
and was also a director in other Hunt
ington lines during the lifetime of the
late Oollis P. Huntington.
For a number of years Requa took
an active part In California politics,
first. as a "Whig and later as a Republi
can. He was for a long time chair
man of the Republican State Central
Committee and was once tendered the
nomination for Governor, an honor he
promptly declined. During the latter
part of his life his attention was de
voted mainly to banking and princi
pally to the affairs of Oakland
Bank of Savings, of which he was the
president.
Requa was descendant of the
Huguenots and was born in Tarry
town, N. V., eighty years ago. He is
survived by a widow and two children.
Mark L. Reo.ua and Mrs. Oscar Long,
wife of General Long. Many un
fortunates knew Requa well for his
many charitable acts, and not a few,
who were his dependents, will have
r-ause to regret his death.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 1905
SPEAKER USES
"CUSS WORDS"
BERKELEY, March 28.â Kipling's
i language, used under provocation and
I savoring of other than classical im
j pulses, was quoted by W. H. Seely in
his address before the College of Com
; merce yesterday afternoon, and as a
result there has commencd a torrid
discussion of the propriety of using
quotations from unauthorized editions
of the famous story-teller's works.
The "co-eds" who were present and
listened to Mr. Seely draw upon the j
j lurid language of the tale-spinner, to |
! add piquancy to his illustration, suf
fered visible shocks, and were not mol
litied by the quasi-apology of the
speaker during the afternoon.
Mr. Seely is a prominent life insur
j ance official of San Francisco, and a
j former newspaper man of New York,
according to his remarks to the stu
dents who heard him yesterday. He
was able to talk of insurance and its
methods, and did so. In connection
with the dry-as-dust insurance mat
ters, however, Mr. Seely referred to
various experiences of his own and
those of other newspaper men, and told
the story of a reporter who called on
Kipling and began his interview by
asking the novelist his Intentions in
the matter of an early voyage to Eng
land.
"That." Kipling is said to have said,
according to Mr. Seely, "is none of
your business!"
There were no dashes or blanks used
by Seely, as he quoted the East Indian
romancer's vigorous barrack-room pro
fanity.
"I suppose," said Mr. Seely in ex
tenuation, "that while there are ladies
present Mr. Kipling's language may
be considered suitable for quotation
purposes." and he then proceeded to
quote it.
Various other stories delighted the
male students, but the co-eds began j
a discussion of them which has not
yet ceased. The discussion hinges upon
the propriety of quoting Kipling, or
other forceful writers, to mixed audi
ences and promises to become as gen
eral and intense as the argument over
Captain Nance's right to make his
military classes yield up information
that will reflect discredit upon mem
bers of those classes.

AUTO WRECKED
ON MINES ROAD
Two Livermoreans Have a
3liraculous Escape From
Death in the Deep Canyon
ALL BECAUSE OF WAGER
I)r. W. S. Taylor and City
Clerk W. B. Wright Have
Very Exciting Experience
LIVERMORE. March 28.â Only a
miracle saved Dr. W. S. Taylor and
City Clerk W. H. Wright of Livermore
from death in the mountains back of
this place last night. As it is Mr.
Wright is badly injured, though Dr.
Taylor escaped without a scratch. It
all happened because the two tried to
take an automobile trip from Liver
more to the famous "Buckeye Camp"
on a wager that a 'chug wagon'" could
get over the hardest and most danger
ous road in the Livermore Mountains.
Dr. Taylor, who is one of the leading
physicians of this section, has just in
vested in a new machine of which he
is very proud. The doctor was very
certain that it could make the trip to
"Buckeye," which is out on the wild
road that leads to the magnesite mines
and which has become known as the
â Mines Road." Mr. Wright was very
certain that the machine could not
make the trip, and then a wager was
made. Both Wright and Taylor are
members of the Buckeye Hunting Club
that owns the hunting lodge known as
'Camp Buckeye." and that spot was
selected as the terminus of the trip.
Livermore was left yesterday after
noon, and the run was made to
"French Joe's" in an hour and ten
minutes. At this point there is a sharp
"S" turn. The first section was made
in safety, but the second curve caught
the machine and it went straight down
the mountainside 100 feet, and there it
struck a bowlder or it would have
reached the bed of the Arrovo Mocho,
1000 feet below. When the machine
stopped Dr. Taylor Â«tuck in the rig,
but Wright kept right on down the
hill, and the worst of it was that he
thought that the v runaway machine
was following him.
The two daring automobolists finally
got a native to drive them in and ar
rived in Livermore at midnight. ,/ThtJ
machine was brought into Livermore
on a lumber wagon to-day.- Wright
was badly cut. but Dr. Taylor suffered
no injury.
No automobile trips will be made
over the Mines road until the new
road is built by the Supervisors.
DEATH CURRENT
BY TELEPHONE
OAKLAND, March 2S.â To what ex
tent the Sunset Telephone Company is
responsible for a death-dealing current
to be traversing its wires is a ques
tion to be argued to Judge and Jury
in the trial of a suit begun to-day
brought by Joanna Horton against the
company for $37,800 damages for the
death of her husband. Horace Horton,
who was killed by taking hold of a
wire coming down the side of his house
at 1820 Thirteenth avenue.
Photographs of the side of the house
showing the wires as taken by E. R.
Jackson were admitted in evidence
and the testimony of Deputy Sheriff
Frank Adams, who lives alongside of
the Hortons and whose telephone had
also been bothering him, it being a
"party line," finished the trial of the
case this afternoon after the Jury had
been drawn.
Mrs. Horton is represented by At
torneys A. A. Moore and Stanley
Moore and Langan & Langan, but this
side of the ease is being left to Stan
ley Moore, who in his examination of
jurora this morning was pitted against
M. C. Chapman, who is associated with
E. S. Pillsbury and George E. de Golia.
The suit is based on the fact that
the telephone had been ringing and
making unusual disturbance and com
plaint had been made to the company
and nothing was done. Horton hap
pened to be in his yard one evening
when the bell began Its ringing and
he went to the side of the house and
started to tear the wires from the
building, when he received a shock
that killed him before the eyes of his
wife.

THINKS BRIDE FALSE
AND WOOS DEATH.
David Taylor Shoots Himself After
Brief Wedded Life.
Jealousy Brings Plumber to Brink
of the Grave.
OAKLAND. March 28.â Fearing that
he had lost the love of his bride. David
P. Taylor, a plumber, attempted to
end a honeynv on of less than three
weeks this afternoon by firing a bullet
into his breast at his apartments in
a rooming-house at 511 Sixteenth
street, conducted by Mrs. E Johnson.
The shot, aimed at his heart, missed
its inteoded mark, inflicting a prob
ably fatal wound in the breast. The
would-be suicide was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital in a supposedly dying
condition.
Taylor's attempt at suicide followed
a bitter quarrel with his wife, whom
he had accused of too readily accept
ing the attentions of other men.
The couple were married in Point
Richmond on March 15, and about ten
days ago came to this city.
At â¢" to-day Mrs. Taylor went out
to visit a friend, and a few minutes
afterward Taylor asked Mrs. Johnson
to look after the baby, his wife's child
by a former marriage, saying: "I'm
going to shoot myself." Mrs. Johnson
thought he was joking and paid no
more attention to the matter until
about twenty minutes later she heard
a pistol shot in Taylor's room. Just
as the shot was fired, George E.
Short, a brother of Mrs- Taylor, en
tered the house. The door of Tay
lor's room was opened and he was
found lying on the bed. The police
were notified and he was at once re
moved to the Receiving Hospital.
Mrs. laylor, formerly Miss May
Short, said after the shooting:
"My husband was insanely jealous
of me and yesterday he accused me
of flirting with other men. and said
that if I did not take care he would
kill me and himself. I have never
given him any cause for Jealousy,
though, and he must have been crazy
when he did this."
The following note was found in Tay
lor's pocket:
To My Brother and Dear Friends and Miss
Hay Short: Do forgive me, dear ones, for
fc-hat 1 am about to do. for I think it for the
best. With a farewell to all. your loving
brother and friend. DAVID P. TAYLOK.
On the margin of the note was found
the name and address: "William P.
Taylor, 4109^ East Sixth street. Kansas
City, Mo., ' and the words: Dear
May, why did you do it?"
CHILDREN SING
FOR TEACHERS
OAKLAND, March 28.â Songs by a
chorus of 125 children from the Gar
field School were a feature of the
morning and afternoon sessions of the
Teachers' Institute to-day, several se
lections being s:ng by the little ones,
under the direction of M< Ruette
Lynch. The children's songs were
much enjoyed by the many teachers

Professor D. R. Augsburg, the su
pervisor c-f drawing in the Oakland

of the institute in Hamilton Hall to
day, illustrating his talk with draw
ings in colors. The principal address
of the morning session was delivered
by Dr. Edward F. Bigelow, who chose
as his topic "Plant ife." Dr. Bigelow
discussed at some length the benefits
of school gardens as an aid to the
study of nature and described the
growing of plants by artificial methods.
He said that by the use of tablets
manufactured by chemists plants may
be made to grow luxuriously under the
most unfavorable circumstances.
The afternoon session of the institute
was held at the Oakland High School
and was devoted to a general discus
sion of school work by the teachers c-f
the various grades in the grammar and
high schools. A Joint meeting of the
teachers of the first, second and third
grades was held in one of the larger,
rooms, and the teachers of each of the
other grades held separate sessions.
"Haunts of Nature" was the subject
of a lecture by Dr. Bigelow at Hamil
ton Hall this evening, in which the
speaker told of the unaided work of the
"great mother." The last sessions of
the institute will be held to-morrow,
the programme for the morning and
afternoon being as follows: 9:3oâLec
ture, "Exile Life in Siberia," Colonel

REQUEST SILL
TO WITHDRAW
OAKLAND, March 2JÂ».â Policeman
J. F. Sill has been requested by the
Police and Fire Commissioners to re
sign for the good of.the department-
Sill declares ne will not resign and de
mands to know what are the reasons
for the boards action. The Com
missioners announce they have no ex
planations to make at this time. They
say the law gives them the power to
dismiss summarily from the depart
ment, and that power will be Invoked
if Sill demands a trial for alleged of
fenses.
Several months ago charges against
Sill were heard by the board. He was
accused of having taken part in the
pilferings, the exposure of which re
sulted in the retirement of former Ser
geant of Police Clark and Patrolmen
Andrews, Hamerton and Stahl from the
department. The specific accusation
against Sill was that he, in company
with Clark, had taken a side of bacon
or a ham from Beckers market, Wash
ington street, near Eighth. Patrolman
Michael Shannon, who reported the
other officers, was the chief witness
against Sill. The Commissioners dis
missed the case, without prejudice to
Shannon.
Since then, it is said. Information
has been taken to the board that has
led to the decision to request Sill's re
signation.
The message from the board was de
livered to Sill under orders of Captain
of Police Wilson. Both Wilson and
<"hief of Police Hodgkins assert they
knew not why the Commissioners had

LONDON. March 28. â With the
Lincolnshire Handicap run at Lincoln
to-day, the flat racing season can be
said to have fairly commenced. This,
the first big race of the year, was won
by an outsider. Sansovino, who was
followed home by Cattycrag with
Park Ranger third. Eighteen horses
ran.
The racing this year will lack the
international character of recent sea

Marvelous.

Peculiar Surface of
Wings Big Point
of Invention.
CONTROL ABSOLUTE
Is aerial navigation at last assured?
Is the problem solved that has fasci
nated mankind through the centuries?
Is this age of confusion of wonders
and illimitable exploit of man to find
Its crowning achievement, its most
startling triumph of man's ingenuity,
thought and resource, hard by San
Francisco?
Faithful report comes from Santa
Clara that wonderful things are soon
to bÂ« shown the world. A modest
professor in the Santa Clara College.
John J. Montgomery by name, has
coptrived that man may fly. For years
and years he has labored, quietly, re
cluse like, almost. The weeks may not
be long till his name and fame have
taken flight to every corner of the
earth.
And the fancies of man from re
motest time to fly with wings like the
bird far and free from the madding
strife on the mundane sphere are about
to be realized. It seems. No cumber
some, treacherous balloon with gas or,
heated air is a part of this remarkable
airship. Professor Montgomery's in
vention Is a winged affair, wings like
those of the bird. He has copied from
nature's own scheme for flight.
* Properly speaking, his contrivance
is an aeroplane. Many before him have
striven and experimented in vain with
aeroplanes. But the hope seemed
â mall with these kite-like affairs, and
It appeared decided that the balloon
must be used for buoyancy if there
should be any success of the airship.
MAKES GUIDANCE SURE-
Professor Montgomery did not give
up the fundamental ideas the aeroplane
offered. He studied and worked inde
fatigably.. and reward for his toil seems
at hand. He has at least solved the
questions of guidance and equilibrium
for a flying ship. He seems to have
accomplished this thoroughly, whereas
the best of the achievements in these
phases of aeronautics have hitherto
been only partially successful.
These two points have already been
demonstrated by flights of Montgom
ery's aeroplane. The bird-like machine
has therefore done what no other air
craft has done with complete success.

"'HE aeroplane
that Professor
Montgomery of San
ta Clara College has
invented bids fair to
be a signal triumph
in the problem of
aerial navigation.
The dirigibility ot
his winged craft is
perfect. Demonstra
tions of this point
have been most satis
factory. By a pecu
liar construction of
the sustaining sur
face, motion of the
air is made use of,
and herein lies the
principal point of
success of this aero
plane over all others,
flights of which have
been sorry failures.
J
Professor Montgom
ery is carefully
guarding the secrets
of his airship until it
shall be completed
and the protection
of patents assured.
But enough of its
merits are known to
justify the conclu
sion that he has
made the greatest
stride in aeronautics
the world has yet
known, and the prac
ticability of a flying
machine now seems
established.
representatives will be invited and the
world allowed to know of hie machine.
MAKES XO IDLE CLAIMS.
Professor Montgomery is apparently
much averse to making ciaims that hÂ«?
cannot substantiate. His caution, his
earnestness and all the circumstances
connected with his work give assurance
that the airship is utterly free from
humbuggery. as has so often been the
case. Associated with him in exploit
ing and building the winged ship is
Father Bell of Santa Clara College.
"I will make no prediction as to pos
sibilities," declares Professor Mont
gomery. He> maintains reservation of
speech, even when his hopes are at
their highest point.
Continuance of flight has not been
entirely solved. But Professor Mont
gomery has been industriously making
f-xperiments along this line very suc
cessfully. How to raise the bird from
the ground and gain the altitude where
the wings will do their part is an
other problem to solve. At the recent
flight of the aeroplane at. Leonards
ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains a
balloon lifted the craft to a height of
3000 feet, when it was set adrift and
the wish of the aeronaut was obeyed i%
every particular. The aeroplane cir
cled and took directions as the rudder
and the tilting of the wings directed.
The following is all that Professor
Montgomery will say in explanation
of the construction of his invention:
"The principal difference in my aero
plane from otl ers lies In the construc
tion of the suiface that gathers power
from the air. I have taken into con
sideration the movements set by the
surrounding sir and have made the
surface of my aeroplane take advan
tage of these movements by a peculiar
form of construction. Not alone is
the sustaining surface to be taken into
account. The agitation of the air is
reckoned with in my contrivance and
that force is made good use of."
GREAT SUSTAINING POWER.
Loosed at an altitude of 3000 feet, the
sustaining power of the wings will give
power of flight for a considerable
length of time. By manipulation of
the wings the aeroplane can go against
the wind as well as follow it, and the
man suspended In the light frame-work
below is complete master of the winged
craft
Professor Montgomery has succeeded
in setting at naught the theories of a
large part of the scientific world. The
late Professor Joseph Le Conte of the
University of California was among
the leading men of science whose opin
ions Montgomery has now upset.
"Aerial navigation is an impossibil
ity," Professor Le Conte was free to
assert to his classes. He had his rea
sons and his Judgment was well
thought out. He drew analogy from
the condor, and pointed to the failures
of the centuries of all of roan's at
tempts to fly. In some particulars, at
least. Professor Montgomery has dem
onstrated that the dlstinisii.: hed scien
tist and the men of the sciei title world
who have shared this opinion were
mistaken. He has proved that wings
can be constructed of sue 1 - a form
that man can fly with the;r., that the
craft can be controlled and guided with
precision among the air currents, and
that the biggest stride the world has
yet known toward sailing the skies
was yet to be made.
This is not the only wonderful thing
that Professor Montgomery has done
for science. The much-heralded dis
covery recently of the "keeling over"
of planets has quietly been taught by
him at Santa Clara College for many
years past. He had himself worked
out the proposition and years later it
dawned upon the men who make more
noise in the world.
Imagination runs riot when it con
templates the success of aerial naviga
tion, and if Professor Montgomery
brings to realisation man's most fanci
ful speculations it is not likely that
his name will remain in the obscurity
of Santa Clara College many years,
s>.nd the credit due him for scientific
roh and discovery will not be
withheld.

STILL LOOKING
FOR ROBBERS
Police, Sheriffs and Pinker
ton 3len Continue Hunting
for the Stege Highwaymen
Although the police of San Fran- !
cisco and Oakiand, the Sheriffs' depu- !
ties of Contra Costa and Alameda
counties and the men of the Pinker
ton agency are hunting for Thomas A.
Collins and John A. Zimmerman, ac
cused of the Central Bank $10,000 robr i
bery at SVege, they have as yet failed
to find a dew to the whereabouts Of
the much-wanted men. in Richmond,
where the men made their headquar
ters prior to the robbery, nothing has
been seen of them since and the local
department has sent for men to assist
Sheiift' Veale in hunting them down.
The first clew obtained relative to
the identity of the meg wanted lor rob
bing Daly and Roc&e came through
one Morgan, a buggy-washer at Aber
nethy's stable, who identified the photo
graph of Collins as that of lite man
who hired the buggy in which the rob
bere made their escape. In Oakland at
Dnly's stable Collins was identified as
the man seen hanging aro-und shortly
before the robbery. Subsequent identi
fication has proved to the satisfaction
of the officers that Zimmerman and
Collins are the robbers.
The chances of apprehending them
are considered very good. Their op
portunity of escape was practically
done away with by the prompt action
of the Sheriff's men Immediately after
the robbery, and with exits closed the
work of the police will be narrowed
down to finding their hiding place
within a circumscribed limit. Although
It 1b believed that the two men are
being concealed by criminals in San
| Francisco, the police are working on
the theory that they separated a short
time after the crime and one may be
Btill in Alameda or Contra Costa
County.
Despite the denial at Plnkerton
headquarters that Charles HeAfy (alias
Mulcahey) is a leading spirit in the
affair, he was seen by reputable wit
nesses several times in conversation
Vith Zimmerman and Collins at Rich
mond for a long time prior to the rob
bery. He, it is understood, was to have
a share in the active consummation of
the crime and the division of the pro
ceeds, but made an unfortunate visit
to San Francisco and received a sen
tence of fourteen years in Folsom for
an old crime, and is at the Broadway
jail awaiting transportation to the pen
itentiary.
It is from him that Sheriff Veale ob
tained his clews that led to the nam
ing of Zimmerman and Collins as the
| perpetrators of the crime. Despite all
promises of a lighter sentence, Henry
' refuses to make any statement to im-
I plicate his pals, expressing a willing
ness to s%rve his sentence and save his
confederates.
Miss Mabel Perry of Stege, who saw
a part of the holdup through field
glasses, has identified the horse and
buggy that were hired at Aber^Â»ethy's
stables, in Oakland, by Collins as the
same rig she observed leaving the
scene of the robbery and following
behind Daly's buggy that was driven
away by Zimmerman. Miss Perry had
no trouble in recognizing the horse,
and she was quite as positive of the
buggy, because of its peculiar con
struction.
The Pinkertons have evidence that
while Collins and Zimmerman occupied
the flat at 1070 Seventh street. Oakland,
they arranged all of the details of the
robbery, and there manufactured the
gags, masks and other paraphernalia
used in securing Daly and Roche after
they had the two Central Bank mes
sengers tfhder range of the persuading
rifle and revolver.
The bank officials are hopeful that
the reward, aggregating $2250. that has
been offered will lead to the arrest of
the fugitives. The Oakland police are
clearing up local ends of the robbery
to get into shape such evidence as can
be collected for use in the event the
suspected men are captured. To this
end the statements of all persons con
cerned are being whipped into shape.
Photographs of Collins and Zimmerman
have been shown to employes at Daly's
stable in Oakland, arrtl Collins has
been identified as a man who was seen
hanging around the place.
The authorities have evidence that
Zimmerman was seen near the Central
Bank one morning when the coin sacks
for shipment to Richmond were being
transferred from the bank to Daly's
team.
May Brown, an Oakland woman
whose aame had been connected with
the case, denied to the police yesterday
that she had any knowledge concern
ing it.

FROM SORROW
Artist Who Takes Arsenic
Declares He Will Employ
Surer Means Next Time
MOURNS WIFE'S DEATH
E. 31. Rinaldo Loses Ambi
tion and Desire to Live Aft
er Woman He Loves Dies
"I'll try a bullet next time. Poison !
Is uncertain." That was the declara- I
tion of E. M. Rinaldo, the artist, who i
attempted lo end his life yesterday by i
taking arsenic.
There is a pitiful tale behind Rinal- '
do's determination to die. Two months
ago his wife, whom he idolized, passed
away suddenly. Her death killed the
artist's ambition. She had been his in
spiration, his all, he said, and when
she was taken away there was nothing
left.
â¢Why should I work now?" he mut
tered as he tossed on his cot at the
Harbor Emergency Hospital. "She
used to look over my shoulder and
watch the pictures as I put them on
the canvas. She was my inspiration.
When I lost her I lost everything. Why
should I paint now?"
Mrs. Rinaldo died about two months
ago. For weeks her husband brooded
alone in his studio near San Rafael.
He tried to work, he says, but his dead
wife's face flitted before him in a mist.
He cculd not see the green Marin Coun
ty hills, he could not see the canvas.
He could only see his wife beckoning.
He came to the city yesterday to
drown all his deep trouble in an orgie
with some brother artists. He sought
a restaurant where Bohemians congre
gate and tried to forget. But even
when the merriment was wildest, when
strident voices were raised in song, he
could hear his wife's voice calling,
calling.
He could stand it no longer. He made
up his mind to die, and started toward
the water front. The vision of the sad
face of his wife that was always be
fore him grew stronger.
Suddenly he remembered that he had
a bottle of medicine in his pocket that
contained arsenic. He drew it out and
drained its contents.
A policeman found him lying in a
doorway near the corner of Pacific and
Davis streets. An ambulance was
hastily summoned and Rinaldo was
taken to the Harbor Hospital, where
prompt treatment by Dr. Hill soon
placed him out of danger.
But Rinaldo is determined on self
destruction. "I will use a pistol next
time," he declared. "I don't expect to
join my wife. I don't believe that
there is a hereafter. I just want to die
and forget everything."
Rinaldo has two grown children, a
son in Oregon ajid a daughter, who is
the wife of a prominent lawyer of
Baltimore. He is a native of Spain and
is 57 years old.

How Is
Your Heart?
Is your pulse weak, too slow,
too fast, or does it skip a beat?
Do you have shortness of
breath, weak or hungry spells,
fainting, smothering or choking
spells, palpitation, fluttering,
pains around the heart, in side
I and shoulder; or hurt when
lying on left side?
If you have any of these
symptoms your heart is weak
or diseased, and cannot get
better without assistance.
Dr. Miles' Heart Cure
strengthens weak hearts, and
rarely ever fails to cure heart
disease. Try it, and see how
quickly you will find relief.
"About January Ist, ltOl, I took
down with weakness and dropsy,
and gradually grew worse. I was told
by my family physician that my case
was hopeless. My neighbors and fam-
ily had given me up to die. My
limbs and body were swollen to one-
third larger than normal size, and
water had collected around my heart.
For at least three months I had to sit
propped up in bed to keep from smoth-
ering. I sent for five bottles of Dr.
Miles' Heart Cure, and by the time I
had taken them all I was entirely
cured. I feel better than I have for
twenty years, and I am able to do
any kind of work on my farm. My
attending physician told me that If it
hadn't been for Dr. Miles' Heart Cure
I would now be in my grave."

Dr. Miles' Heart Cure Is sold by
your druggist, who will guarantee that
the first bottle will benefit. If it falls
he will refund your money.

PLATT MAY GET
A PLACE HERE
The presence in this 1 city during the
last two weeks of Howard V. Platt,
superintendent of the Utah division of
the Oregon Short Line, has given rise
to several rumors all of which are to
the effect that he is to receive an ap
pointment from General Manager Cal
vin of the Southern Pacific Company.
Letters received here from Salt Lake
by local railroad men also say that be
fore leaving that city Platt intimated
to a number of his close friends that
he would probably soon give up hia of
ficial duties there for more responsible
ones on this coast.
Since his arrival here Platt has been
out on the road a great deal with
General Manager Calvin and was the
latter's guest on a recent trip in the
private car Houston down the coast,
and also to Nevada a week ago, when
General Manager Calvin went thither
to personally investigate the freight
traffic congestion on the Carson and
Colorado road. At the railroad build
ing in this city no one seems to know
Just what purposes brought Platt to
this city at this particular time, but the
fact that he has spent the better part
of his stay in the company of Gen
eral Manager Calvin and has been pay
ing a gTeat deal of attention to the
operating affairs of the Southern Pa
cific, has caused many of the officials
of the road to atrongly suspect that
there is more truth in the rumors con
cerning the Sa.lt Lake man's future
than the local heads of the company
will admit.
Yesterday there was a report in cir
culation that Platt is to be appointed
to a position In the operating depart
ment close up to the general manag
er, but whether he is to succeed some
one or will fill some newly created
place is a matter of speculation. Platt
is regarded as a clever operating de
partment man and one likely to re
ceive promotion any time.
CONTENDS WIFE TRUMPED
UP CHARGE AGAINST HIM
Gustave Ahlstedt Says Spouse Placed
Strychnine in Her Coffee to
Injure Him.
Martha Alice Ahlstedt, who caused
her husband to be taken from their
home at 331 Jessie street on a charge
that he had attempted to kill her by
placing strychnine in her coffee, is de
fending herself as best she can against
the charges of cruelty her husband,
Gustave, makes in an action for di
vorce now on trial before Judge
Troutt. Gustave is engaged in an ef
fort to prove that it was his wife that
put the strychnine in the coffee for
the purpose of trumping up a charge
against him. Though she firmly de
nies the allegation, he has succeeded
I in establishing the fact that she pur
chased a bottle of strychnine for some
uncertain purpose and that she had
the same in her possession up to the
11th inst., when she moved away from
the house of trouble to new quarters.
Her husband's charge of cruelty Is
based on this accusation he brands as
| false, and on a general statement of
! nagging. She denies, however, that
| she treated him cruelly, but says he
treated her so unkindly that her
nerves are shattered and as a result
I she is subject to fainting spells. She
. is also engaged in an effort to prove
I that he has property, which he denies,
j and withal the case presents unusual
evidences that the marriage was a
failure from first to last. Judge Troutt
will probably decide the case to-day.
Decrees of divorce were granted
yesterday to Hannah Goldstein from
Marks Goldstein for cruelty, Ruby
May Carberry from David J. Carberry
for extreme cruelty, Charles S. Dick
inson from Edna A. Dickinson for in
; temperance, and Delia Johnson from
I D. Johnson for willful neglect.
J. J. Gibbons has sued Sarah A.
Gibbons for divorce, alleging deser-
I tion. Evelyn Zinn asks for a divorce
' from Edward A. Zinn for desertion.
Josephine Braham complains that Os
car Braham has failed to provide her
with the common necessaries of life
and she asks for a divorce on that
ground. Jennie A. Duggan asks for
a divorce from Edward F. Duggan for
extreme cruelty. Eugene Meehan
claims Wilma Meehan has treated him
cruelly and for this reason he asks
for a divorce. Martha Jane Watkins
has sued her husband, Dudley R. Wat
kins, for maintenance. He keeps a
grocery at 500 Shotw#ll street.

THREE ROBBERS
ATTACK DENTIST
Another robbery, the victim of which,
after being deprived of his money and
watch, was viciously beaten, took
place last night !n an alley next to 1411
Mason street. Dr. George Bennett, a
dentist who Is here from Sacramento
on a visit, was assaulted there by
three highwaymen.
Bennett told his rtory to the police.
At first it was not credited, as he ap
peared to be under the Influence of
intoxicants, but later when E. Syl
vester, who Hve3 at 1411 Mason, told
of having seen three men running
from the alley, and upon investigation
finding Bennett lying on the ground
in a semi-conscious condition, the
police concluded it was a holdup.
Bennett, who is stopping at the
Strathmore, 207 Larkln street, was
visiting some friends in the northern
part of the city. On returning to his
lodgings a man suddenly stepped from
the alley and dealt him a blow on the
hetad. This man and two others pulled
him in from the street and. after taking
his watch and $S5, they, dealt him
several blows on the head, knocking
him to the ground.
After being discovered by Sylvester,
Bennett's head cleared and he made
his way to police headquarters. He
then went to a hospital for treatment.
His scalp is lacerated and it is feared
that his skull is fractured.
Detective Cody was detailed on the
case.

FERRY STEAMER
NEAR DISASTER
ThÂ« c*rÂ« and promptness >f Captain
Leale of the ferry-boat Newark last
night prevented a collision with a de
relict dredger near the mouth of the
narrow gauge slip on the 3:30 trip from
San Francisco. As it was. the boat
escaped " "without even t pping thÂ«
dredger.
The Newark was plowing along in
the heavy southeaster that was blow-
Ing and was rollin? heav!' i*aptaln
Leale was watching everything him
self and was holding the boat well up
into the wind. Suddenly everybody.
and particularly Engineer Scott on thÂ«
lower deck, was startled by the ex
treme danger alarm of six bells. Scott
threw the engines back in an instant,
and the Newark began fighting to re
duce speed aad start backward.
Right across the bows of the New
ark loomed a big dredger, without light
or manager, drifting helplessly and
dangerously at the mercy of the wind.
The dredger had been at wÂ«>rk upon the
new construction at the emd of thÂ«
Alameda mole and in th^ gale hai
feroken loose and drifted into the path
of the Newark. There was nothing
except the dark outline of the big
Iron-covered machine to warn r*aptain
Leale. and that was almost hidden in
the flying scud. When the Newark
finally stopped, her bow was hardly
a foot from the drifting dredger.
Captain Leale took his ferry-boat
around the dredger, but it caused a
delay of half an hour in making thÂ«
landing. "When he arrived at the molÂ»
he sent help out to secure the machine
that was rapidly drifting across thÂ«
track of the broad gauge ferry route.
Few of the passengers knew what a
narrow escape they had had, for most
of them were se .isick.

WEDNESDAY .MARCH 29, 1905
THE CANAL INQUIRY.
GENERAL BRISTOW, as executive commissioner, is con
ducting a very searching inquiry into the effect of Govern
ment ownership and operation of the Panama railway upon
the commerce of the Pacific Coast. San Francisco, being the lead
'apon of the coast and having the largest business by land and
<i. i- greatly interested in this inquiry.
Jhe Panama railway was built originally under a concession
E C olombian Government, by which it was fixed that no other
transportation line, railway or canal, should be built through that
territory to connect the two oceans. When the French company
t the Panama canal concession it found it necessary to buy a
majority of the stock of the Panama railway in order to avojd ihis
feature of the original concession. Holding both the railway and
concession, that company was independent of the terms of the
concession. When we acquired the rights of the French company
by purchase it became necessary to buy the railroad and the line of
steamers owned by the French company connecting Colon and New
k and run in connection with the railroad..
The United States therefore now finds itself the owner of a line
of *t earners arid a railway and engaged in the business of commer
cial transportation on land and water, in competition with its own
citizens. The Government was compelled to accept this condition
a** a necessary incident to the acquisition of the canal. The ques
tion i? what to do with this commercial property and this going
ntsinesfi which the Government was compelled to acquire. General
Bristow is trying to find out the views of the people of this coast
tat subject, and is getting a very varied lot of opinions.
Impinged upon the subject is the existing contract between the
Panama railroad and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, by which
the latter ha^ an exclusive privilege oi a through bill of lading from
to c<Â»av. That contract has long been the subject of contro
versy. There are those who think it ha* been in restraint of trade
. and has deprived San Francisco of the benefit of a four-fifths water
way bo New York and Atlantic seaboard points. There are others
who believe that or.lv that contract has enabled the maintenance of
an American steamship line to the isthmus, and so has opened and
kept open direct arid regular commercial intercourse between this
city and all Central America under the American flag. These two
conditions of opinion seem to be irreconcilable. It is admitted, how
that throwing open the through bill of lading will put the
carrying trade into foreign bottoms, unless the United States, owning
tlie line of steamers on the Atlantic side and the railway, shall also
t stttbtish. as a business enterprise of the Government, a line of
steamers on \h\< side from Panama to San Francisco and also to the
Puget Sound ports.
This situation reveals the complexities of the Government situ
ation <lne to its being compelled to buy the railway and steamer line
of the French company. The Secretary of War, in advance of the
conclusions reached by General Bristow's inquiry, has already given
notice of the termination of the contract with the Pacific Mail Com
pany. Whether General Bristow's report will change that intention
or nut remain*- to be seen. If the opponents of the contract put their
opposition, as seems to be the case, upon the ground that the Gov
ernment should go into the transportation business itself, and, rc
gsrdless of any profit to itself, should by competition drive its own
citizens out of that business, their case is weakened. The people
will stand anything rather than plunge the Government headlong
-. socialistic experiment of that kind. If the United States drive
its own citizens off the Pacific Ocean, why not off the Atlantic also*
and out of business on the continent that lies between?
It is not necessary to discuss the question whether the Pacific
Mail line to Panama is essential to the commerce of this coast, if
the sole alternative be a Government line. The United States can
relieve itself of the difficulty by selling its Colon and New York line
â  p.r.iers and having as little to do with commercial transportation
ssible while the canal is under construction. When that work
is finished and in use all issues over the Panama railway will be
obsoleted.
But suppose when the canal is finished the United States finds
itself with an Atlantic and Pacific line of steamers on hand, shall it
then continue to do all the transportation via the canal between the
two coast*, as a Government enterprise? If not. why not? If such
? prospect is not agreeable to the investor* in shipping property, they
can save their investments from destruction by their own Govern
ment by protesting now against the first step in the process. Let
the Government keep its hands off commercial transportation.
TO AID AMERICAN SHIPPING.
BUSINESS men of Cleveland recently met in the Union Club
of that city and effected an organization whose purpose i.s
expressed in the words of their resolution : "The country's
whole prosperity depends upon the continuation and extension of
our foreign commerce. * * The situation is critical and calls
for immediate action."
This recognition by interests so far from the seacoast shows
that attention to the subject is being given by men who, though
busy building up the prosperity of the middle YYesi by direct de
velopment on the ground, now see that their energies must reach
out from the filling of their inland storehouses to the extension of
foreign trade, and that the most effectual way to do this is To insist
upon such aid to American ships as will encourage their building
and competition for a growing share of the ocean carrying trade.
Our foreign commerce now amounts to the gr^at sum of $2,500,
000,000 per year, but it is being carried under foreign flags, and there
is not a single ship being built anywhere in the United States for
this trade. Our ocean going fleet is smaller than it was in 1810, and
is steadily decreasing in spite of the fact that we exported nearly
$1,500,000,000 worth of merchandise during the twelve months end-,
ing with last September. In the tonnage of the world we take only
sixth place. Other nations are succeeding where we fail. England,
Italy, France and Germany are giving government aid to the'r
merchant fleets, and as a consequence carry our cargoes with ad
vantages which forestall competition.
It is claimed that ships can be built in this country at prices
that approximate closely to what they cost abroad, and this not
withstanding the fact that the workmen in this country are paid
much better wages â wages which entitle them to be self-respecting
citizens. It is because of the cost of maintenance that we need to
have the foreigners' advantages offset by such subsidies as would
enable the payment of wages up to the American standard. A good
example of the need of accounting for this increase in cost is given
in the comparison of the wages paid on the American liner St. Louis
with those of the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse. The German vessel
pay* an average of $15 43 per month, the American $20.^75. The
\merican pays out $3585 more in wages per month to its 380 men
<han does the German to its 500 men.
It to not too much to say that men operating a transportation Rervice,
upon which more than a million persons are dependent, who "hold up" the
â  mploying rompany with an ultimatum to be accepted or rejected in seven
hours, and then in the middle of the night order a strike going into effect
before daylight, fhow a spirit which ought to deprive them of all public sym
pathy and exhibit themselves as not to be depended on in an employment
which peculiarly demands faithfulness. â New York Times.

Her companion': did not â¢ answer Im
mediately. i ; . .
"You must reduce 'your complaint

the young lawyer, at length. "What,

to you." :â [/â 'â ;) â â¢":'
"I'm sure I don't know what makes

"Don't be personal, Mr. I Roscom

a blush.
"1 am- discussing fact, and that is

me tired yet."
"If you were one of these unvary
ing men how would you propose to a
girl?" asked the young man gravely.
Miss Breen promptly sat down. After
she had rested and meditated for half
a minute she answered:'
"It would depend on the girl. That's
the very point. Instead of having a
formula, such as you men hand down
from father to son, I should study the
nature of the woman and find words
to appeal to her and to her alone. If
she loved flowers I'd spend my last
dime on a rose. They say a battle was
lost once for want of a horseshoe. More

merely said I had no theories," ob
served Roscommon.
"Very well, here is a fact for you. I
know a man that told a girl of his am

her to many him. Now this girl didn't
care a hairpin for art and the only
idea she had about it was that artists
were always poor and shabby. She
was just ready to fall in love with him.
and if she had it wouldn't have mat
tered what he did for a living. If he
only had had sense enough to tell her
how prettily her hair shone in the
lamplight he wouldn't be a sour old
bachelor now. and she â "
"It looks just as well in the daylight,"
remarked Roscommon, addressing the
mirror behind Madge.
"I hope the subject doesn't bore you,
Miss Breen," he went on, "but you
have made an impossible condition.
You say a man should know the girl.
That Is well, if he can. But now sup

BOON TU FAT FOLK.
Miss Elizabeth Falconer has just
j perfected *n invention which promises
to revolutionize the lacing of shoes
by fat people, says the Louisville Her
â¢ aid.
The invention enables men or wom
en to lace their shoes without stoop
ing, and although it was not invented
primarily for fat men â there are no
Tat women â it will be utilized as much
' by them as by the aged and infirm,
j for whose comfort it was brought into,
. the world. The invention is simple.
i One lace string is permanent In posi
tion, and pulling the top of it laces
the shoe. Pulling the bottom string
loosens the shoe.
DON'T FORGET THAT-
i
j There is plenty of opportunity for
superior talents. The top of the ladder
of success, offers plenty of standing
room and Invites guests. The lower
part only is fearfully crowded. There
is no excuse for the universal wail of
lack of opportunity, for there is no
lack, says the Chicago Journal. The ;
trouble lies with the demands laid upon
those who aspire to first place. One
thing is certain â there is no quarter
for the whiner and precious little en
couragement for those who do- not care
to work with might and main.

THE TRUTH ABOUT
LUTHER BURBANK.
! In California there doth dwell
I A man named Burbank â truth to tell.
A name like Flowerbank more would fit
; So horticultural a wit.
At any time that man is able
To grow some strange new vegetable;
For instance he'll mix heliotrope
With soap weed â and grow toilet soap!
A fadeless flower he has devised:
A scentless onion, highly prized.
And just to keep the nation calm.
A non-explosive Russian bomb.
From eggplants in gooseberry rows
A goose-egg-plant he neatly grows;
From planting hops with wheat he
makes
Some crisp, self-rising griddle cakes.
Lapt fall the great inventor saw
A meadow full of golden straw;
So here he planted violets.
Pale ribbon-grass and mignonettes.
The neighbors who beheld said, "Poor
L. Burbank has gone daffy, sure!"
But early in the spring the field
Strange-looking plants began to yield.
The plants grew up in wondrous wiseâ
The neighbors gasped and rubbed their
eyes
When they beheld* on every limb
An Easter hat of Paris trim!
And thai is why I say, say I,
L,. Burbank's name should never die,
And that his genius for invention
Should be rewarded with a pension.

WOMAN HAS BETTER TIME
"Who has the best timeâ a man or a
â  woman?" Here is a question put for
ward by the Grand Magazine. I have
not as yet had' an opportunity of read
ing the discussion, but that shall not
prevent me from joining in it, says a
writer in London Sketch. I will give
you Â«ix reasons therefore why a wo
manâan average womanâ always has
had and always will have a better time
than a man:
1. Because she is more easily
: pleased.
2. Because she expects less than a
man, but%generally manages to get
I more.
3. Because she can always make a
; man do what she wants.
4. Because she never does anything
she doesn't want to do.
5. Because she is less sensitive.
6. Because she can cry without feel

marks are based upon the idle gossip
of the profoundly ignorant.

"Miss Breen. did you ever hear that
I was a millionaire?" The question

was aware of the hurt, disappointed
expression in her wide-open eyes.
"No; and I hate you for telling me
now," she flashed.
"I did not tell you. I only asked a
question." The harshness was all
gone from his tone. For the first time
that afternoon Roscomraon's voice
grew tender. He leaned toward his
companion and said:
"They told me you cared only for
money â that you had no heart. I
knew they lied, but I wanted you to
prove it to me. You have shown me
the girl I have been waiting to see.
You have taught me the way to woo
her. I am not rich, Madge, and if I
were I should never dream that
money could buy you. You say that
all men are alike. All but one, you
mean. The man you love will bs

d^ar, not because of what I i-an give
you, but because of what I can take.
A man with any other ambition would
not have room to keep the treasure
of your love. You can do what you
will with me. The only thing I shall
boast of is a boundless capacity for
being loved. Do you want such a
man ?"
"And you haven't once said 'I love
you,' " exclaimed, with a touch of
amusement in her voice. "That is a
slight variation from the usual form.
Do you suspect I shall do it all?"
"You would have to try me to find
out, no matter what I might say." re
plied Roscommon.
"Well," the breathed softly and
then paused. He rose and walked to
her chair and waited, with his head
bent toward hers.
"Please," she whispered, "if you
don't love me never let me find it

An interesting stage of the eontro
\ersy between the Sacramento Valley
Development Association and thÂ« Cali
fornia Commissioners to the Portland
Exposition in relation to space for the
Sacramento Valley to make a separate
exhibition of its products has been
reached. Secretary Beard of the de
velopment association has recently
been through the Sacramento Valley
and has reported that there is very
keen interest in the idea of a separate
building and a separate Sacramento
Valley exhibit. His idea is that 'the
opportunity to do missionaj-y work is
better at Portland than at any place
that we have worked."
The California Commissioners adhere
to the rule that they established some
time ago and exhibit a drawing of a
larg-e pyramid that has been planned
for the middle of the California build
ing at Portland, a hexagonal affair,
fixty feet high, each side having more
than TOO souare feet of available ex
hibition space, and say that but one of
these spaces will be given to the Sac
ramento Valley, one to the San Joaquin
Valley and the others to the various
â Ã¼bdivisicms of the State as previously
enumerated.
Therefore, whether the Sacramento
Valley does or doeÂ» not make a sepa
rate show on the Portland Exposition
grounds in a building provided by its
own citizens, a representative collec
tion of its products will be prominently
placed. Commissioner I' her said yes
terday that arrangements have been
entirely completed for gathering Sac
ramento Valley products of all classes,
the wines,. wool, cereals, fruits and so ;

"I have inquired." said Mr. Filcher.

PLANS TO OUST
CITY GRAFTERS
Believed New Police Chief
Will Be Chosen to Do the
Election Work for Schraitz
HERRIN - RFEF COMPACT
Forces of Good Citizenship
Must Inite in Order to
Overthrow Corrupt Regime
Sentiment in favor of a new deal
In municipal affairs is daily growing
stronger. During the last week sev
| eral Assembly district conferences j
have been held. Citizens who have
j not been remarkably active in former
campaigns give assurance of substan
tial support of organized effort to ob
tain better, local government. The
fact is fully recognized that something
more than' public agitation in the
: newspapers and mass meetings will be
; required to overthrow the regime now
in power. It is the judgment of some
men who recall the events of the "Fif- |
ties" in San Francisco that the forces
of Schmitz, Ruef, Herrin and Lynch
are so strongly intrenched that noth
ing less heroic than a vigilance com
mittee" can oust the grafters. An old:
time Republican leader who- battled
against the forces of Higgin?, Gan
non. Chute, Mannix, Brady and Buck
ley mentions the fact that the
Schmitz-Ruef regime is in position to
hold the works in primary election
contests, through the influences of the
Police Department. Election Commis
sioners, Board of Public Works and
Health Department and the support
of the Southern Pacific Company po
litical bureau.
Taxpayers and other good citizens
generally view the removal of Chief
of Police Wittman with a sense of
serious apprehension. It is asserted
that judgment was rendered against
the Chief before the inquiry into his
alleged misconduct was begun. He
was advised by an eminent attorney, a
man of known capacity, that resist
ance before the Commissioners was
absolutely useless, as the Mayor had
surely resolved to place at the head
of the Police Department a man who
would scruple at "nothing to perpetu
ate the administration of Schmitz and
Ruef.
CHIEF MUST TARE ORDERS.
The proceedings in court for the re
instatement of the ousted Chief will
be studied with the keenest Interest.
The charter may be interpreted as an
instrument that gives the Mayor pow
er to intrench himself against the
people, or it may be Interpreted as an
instrument for the protection of the
taxpayers. Everywhere the comment
is made that Wittman was a creditable
Chief of Police and suspicion is wide
spread that some one who will readily
take and execute orders of Schmitz,
! Ruef and Herrin will be chosen to
! command the police force of San
Francisco.
Statements coming from members
of the Republican State Central Com
mittee to the effect that the com
pact entered into between Ruef and
Herrin in 1903 to defeat Crocker and
elect Schmit* no longer exists are not
accepted as correct by well posted
observers. In January last Herrin
and Ruef were allies at Sacramento.
It is the belief all along the political
line that the law department of the
! Southern Pacific is still giving to Ruef
! sympathy -uid substantial support. It
I is still an open question whether the
I Republican County Committee as now
constituted is an organization under
the control of Herrin and Ruef.
Thomas D. Riordan is chairman and
Assemblyman Thomas E. Atkinson
secretary. They are counted Herrin
and Ruef followers, although Riordan
is a man of independent characteris
1 tics. Under the present primary elec
â¢ tion law a County Committee cannot
! do much beyond designating the date
iof the nominating convention and
providing representation thereto,
hence politicians hold that the sympa
thies of a committee will not cut
much of a figure in a vigorous cam
paign for election of delegates to the
convention. .
75* MANY PLANS PRESENTED.
Many plans of a local convention
have been presented. It is claimed by
many citizens that the surest road to
success is along non-partisan lines.
The suggestion is made that the Mer
chants' Association and other enter
prising organizations should call for
a general convention for the nomi
nation of a ticket, and that all men,
irrespective of party inclination,
should be invited to vote for the can
didates on that ticket. Opponents of
this plan contend that Schmitz and
Ruef would welcome a campaign on
non-partisan lines, as the result would
be four tickets at least in the field.
Ruef, Herrin and Schmitz . base their
hopes of success on a division of the
forces of good citizenship.
Under the existing election law of
California a political party must pre
serve its organization in order to se
cure a designation on the ocial bal
lot- Politicians therefore assert that
no difference what action may be ta
ken on a non-partisan basis,: the . reg
ular Republicans and the regular
Democrats will hold their ' respec
tive conventions. It goes without say
ing that Ruef and Schmitz will or
ganize a labor convention and detail
delegates on the municipal payrolls
to attend and make such nominations
as may be dictated. Here, then, will
be four tickets in the field. . ;
The plan which seems to meet with
the greatest favor is the creation un
t der the agency of the primary elec
tion law of j a Republican convention
composed of the best citizenship , of
that ; party and a Democratic conven
tion to which the best men of .that
organization may be chosen. If the
convention can be ' brought ' together
on a nomination -j for Mayor, â â  victory
over the : combined forces Âof Ruef.
Schmits and Herrin can be achieved
by the people.' Non-partisan indorse
ment of the best nominations on the
general ticket would follow.
Men ; who have given 1 the situation

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 1905.
BEGIN BATTLE
ON NEW FLANK
Opponent of Edna Wallace
Hopper Asks for Aid From
the State Supreme Court
TAKE STEP WITH HASTE
Contest Appears Likely to
Become One of Bitterest
in California's History
Without waiting for the ink to dry
on Judge Coffey's decision declaring
that the Alexander Dunsmuir will must
be probated in this State, the attorneys
for James Dunsmuir have petitioned
the Supreme Court to forbid the lower
tribunal from executing the judgment
in favor of Kdna Wallace Hopper it
is prayed that the decision rendered
live years ago in favor of the brother
be decreed final. This is only one
feature of the great legal battle to be
instituted as a result of Judge Cof
! v's dÂ»clsrfon.
The Supreme Court took the matter
under advisement yesterday. If the ar
guments advanced by the petitioners
seem worthy of investigation an al
ternative writ of mandate will issue.
A hearing will ihen be granted both
sides and a final decision will eventu
ally be rendered. If the Supreme
Court refuses to consider the petition
for a writ of mandate an appeal from
the judgment will be taken in the
regular way.
if Judg.- Coffey's position is sus
tained by the Justices, the Dunsmuii
will must be brought to California for
probate. In the courts of this State,
Edna Wallace Hopper will endeavor to
prove her claims to the enormous for
tune. Judge Coffey having held that
the testator resided in California. The
brother of decedent will make a bitter
fight on this point.
If the will can be kept out of the
courts of this State the famous actress
will stand little chance of ever put
ting the Dunsmuir millions in circu
lation.
Wants Sidewalks Repaired.
The West of Castro Club petitioned
the Board of Supervisors yesterday to
< ause the sidewalks at Twenty-fifth,
Jersey and Diamond streets to be re
pa : ied, as they are in dangerous con
dition. The petition says that sev
eral futile appeals have been made
to the Board of Works for relief in
the matter.

â AD\^EKTISEÂ»IENTS.
With the Aid I
of an Ang- elus
The business man can come home and play
and enjoy, the piano â the woman who has no
time to practice finger exercises and learn note
reading can play the greatest master-pieces in
the world with the aid of an Angelus.
You gain a musical knowledge through
learning the Angelus â you learn a thousand
times more than the drudgery of musical tutor-
ing can give you.
The Angelus is the only piano-player that
exactly overcomes and banishes the mechani-
cal effect so noticeable with other instruments.
The entire control of the expression rests with
the player. The wonderful phrasing lever gives
instant response to the lightest touch as
quickly as the brain demands. No other piano-
player has such a device or its equivalent, and
as a consequence it remains mechanical and
therefore not comparable to the Angelus.
The Angelus is superior, however, not only
in one or two vital points, but superior in
every point to all its imitators.
A half hour spent with our demonstrator will
prove these statements absolutely.

YOUNG CHORUS
IS EFFECTIVE
Pupils of Public Schools
Give Evidence of Vocal
Ability at a Rehearsal
PREPARE FOR FESTIVAL
Over a Thousand Children
Sing Their Best Before
City's School Directors
A.bout 1200 of the 6000 publi9 school
children who will take part in the May
festival were rehearsed yesterday aft
ernoon at the Mission High School.
The youthful singers were under the
direction of Mif=B EBtelle Carpenter,
Â»upervisor of music in the public
schools, and th< j y save such splendid
account of themselves as to win the
commendation of School Directors
Koncovieri, Boyle and Altmann, while
at the conclusion of the rehearsal Su
perintendent of Schools Langdon de
livered so kind and complimentary an
nddres*. to the boys and girls and to
Miss Carpenter that the bright young
folk buret out irto cheers and hand
clapping. They realised that they had
fairly astonishf-d the gentlemen who
watch over the public educational
department of San Francisco, and their
l>ride in their work and the result was
evident.
It was an unfual treat to hear those
hundreds of sweet voices giving Gou
nod's "Praise Ye the Lord" with a full
appreciation of the value and tempera
ment of the romposttion. MiÂ»s Carpen
ter then took her willing class through
the rnn7<>s of ihe important chorus,
â¢'The Three Chafers." and here the
young people exhibited a musical intel
ligence that would be looked for only
among adults of long experience In
chorus work.
There was no play In the rehearsal.
It was all a serious, albeit pleasant
endeavor to prove that while the voice
quality was present so, too, was the
culture.
When "The Three Chafers" had been
gone over and over with until there
was almost complete uniformity in the
rendition Miss Carpenter called for
"Dixie."
The time- honored and inspiring song
brought out all the vocal energy of the
singers, tine part' of the song was
whistled by the boys, and later the
whole class marked the time with the
clapping of hands. It was most ef
fectively done.
Patriotism rose high when the chorus
burst fcrih with the strains of "Co
lumbia the '"Jem of the OcÂ»an." The dl
rectoresÂ«s had tutored her pupils to
wmve their handkerchiefs in various
graceful ways during the singing of
the cnorus. It was all well done, it
was all effective, and added to it all
was the fact that the delightful vocal
achievement wjis accomplished by San
Francisco children.
Miss M. D. Mc-Olade, assistant super
visor of music, acted as accompanist.
No matter how silly a girl is her
folks always expect her lr> marry well.

SPECTATORS HAVE CHANCE TO CHEER THROUGHOUT THE FIGHT
Kentuckian Outgames Clever
Opponent in Hard
Ring Battle,
BOXERS m BUSY THROUGHOUT
Colored Man Has the Clever
ness, but Does Not Take
Any Chances,
Marvin Hart matched - his gameness
against the cleverness of Jack John
son in Woodward's Pavillion last night,
and at the end of twenty rounds of
fierce lighting. Referee Alex Greggains
gave an entirely Just decision in favor
of Hart. He was / the : aggressor
throughout, and there was never Â£p
instant that he was not trying in an
awkward style to land on the elusive
negro.
When the men shaped up for the
first round. Hart's Dos:tion seemed
only a caricature of the way a fighter
should shape up, while Johnson was
â¢he beau ideal of the boxer. > It seemed
the fight would last but a few rounds,
but Johnson showed his usual lack of
aggressiveness --d would not take ad
vantage of the many openings his less
skilled opponent left for him. At the
beginning of each round . Hart , would
make a dash at Johnson and invariably
, landed. Johnson would then get into
action with right and left, but he was
then satisfied to let well enough alone
and would not follow up his man.
While Johnson is fairly sheathed with !
muscle, the majority of his blows did
not seem to have an ounce of strength j
behind them. It was ' astonishing the j
little damage done by the two power- |
ful men, considering the apparent ef- |
fort they put forth. Had Johnson a j
small part of the aggressiveness shown ;
by Hart there would have been nothing i
to the fight.
IX GOOD CONDITION.
Both men were in superb physical j
condition. Johnson's muscles showed
to better advantage, but it was evident
Hart was ready for a severe contest,
as the farther it went the better he
seemed to get. He began to show a
slight lead when half the route had
been traversed, and did much the best
work in the last ten rounds.
The double attraction of witnessing
a fight and of seeing Jabez White, the '
Knglish boxer, attracted the large at- i
tendance to the pavilion. After the j
preliminary bouts the spectators set !
up a cry 6f "White!" "White:"
â¢'White!" The modest Englishman en- I
tered the ring in response to the call
of the crowd. 'When they demanded !
a speech he said, "All I can say is that !
I am here at last and I will try to give
a good account of myself."
Charley Mitchell was then called for I
and introduced as the "Pride of Old !
England." He tried to make a speech,
but some cheap wits in the gallery
kept making remarks that . almost
cirowned out his voice. He said, "I
am happy to be here in California
again after an absence of many years. :
<â ! have found you genial good people j
'v ho love fair sport. 1 wish to say that
Jabez White is a good representative ;
of Britain and when he meets Britt j
he will give you a good show for your |
money."
Battling Nelson was next called for. j
â When he entered the ring he said, 'I I
will fight Jimmy Britt any old time." !
There were insistent calls for Britt, the
spectators not knowing: he had left
early in the day for Harbin Springs.
When this was finally announced, for
some unexplained reason the spectators
j'*ered at the man who is 'to fight
White.
Before the heavyweights got to work
Johnson examined the bandages on
Hart's hands carefully. , He objected to
' heir thickness, but Anally retired ; to
' I* corner and had some light ban
cages fixed on his own hands. When
'â he gong sent the men together it
reemed a rough and tumble fight would
result. The combatants at once
uorked into a clinch and held on while 1
they hit at one another furiously.
Hart landed two rights to the body
and got a hard left in return. He then
tried for the head and got one in re
turn for this. He clinched Johnson.
who hit in every direction trying to
find a weak spot.
HART MISSES SWINGS. '
Hart missed several right swings,

missed a hard right uppercut, which
shot by Johnson's head. Johnson land

body which shook him up. Near the
end of the round Johnson was hold
ing on to escape punishment. Hart
then sent a hard right to the body
which made him wince, following this
up with a right to the head. John
son made a show of viciousness in the
ninth round, but it was all on tho sur
face, as there was no action to back
it up. He sent a right and left to
Hart's head which did not stop his
onrush in the slightest degree. Hart
tried a long range right which man
aged to connect with Johnson's jaw.
Johnson punished Hart severely Â»ear
the end of the round, making him
bleed profusely from the nose and
mouth. Johnson went after Harts
core eye in the tenth round, but there
was no finishing power In his blows.
Hart was trying ail the time and kept
sending in rights and lefts, rome of
which landed and had the effect ot. mak
ing Johnson stiil more cautious. Hart
commenced to Improve In the elev
enth round. He staggered Johnson with
a right to the head and th?n both in
dulged in a plugging match until the
bel! stopped them. *
Hart continued on the aggressive in
the twelfth round, the most effective
blow beinc alright feo the body, fol
lowed by a right to the head. In the
thirteenth Johnson devoted most of his
flea to uppei cutting, but this could
not keep off th<> aggressive Kentuck
ian. in the fourteenth round Hart
knocked a broad grin off Johnson's
face with a hnjd right swing. Xedi
the end of the round Johnson ripped
his left into the body hard.
Hart was the aggressor throughout
the- fifteenth round and landed some
hard right swing? to the head. John
ion upperru; him repeatedly. While
the blows undoubtedly hint, they di<l
not cause Hart to slow down. Eirly
in the seventeenth round Johnson
rushed Hart to the ropes, and for a
tiir.e the white man's ht-ad and shoul
ders \ver<' outside the upper roije.
Johnson landed a hard right and
left to the body and got a. hard right
to the body, which undoubtedly hurt
him. Hart was the aggressor all
through the eighteenth round and also
the nineteenth. Near the end of this
round Johnson landed right and left
which rocked Hart's head. . Hart
came bnck fighting and landed a hard
right sowing to the jaw, which took a
lot of fight out of Johnson.
HART IS STRONG.
The twentieth was all in favor of
Hart. The men fought all over the
ring, but even at this stage of the
game Johnson would not take a
chance with the nervy Kentuckian.
He hung on for a time and the house
was in a wild uproar, the spectators
on their feet cheering for Hart and
yelling for him to go in and knock
Johnson out.
Hart seemed as fresh as when he
started, although he was no beauty
to look at, and he kept up a fusillade
on any part of Johnson's anatomy
within reach. A few seconds before
time was up a photographer in the
balcony touched off a flashlight. The
fighters thought the round had ended,
and they ceased their struggle.
Referee Greggains knew the bel! had
not sounded and he sent them at it
again. They only sot fairly started
on a slugging match when the bell
sounded the end of the fipht. The
referee at once pointed to Hart as the
winner and the applause which greeted
the decision lasted for several minutes.
It was the consensus of opinion that
if-either of them ever decides to fight
Jeffries there will be another death in
the ring, this time from sheer fricht.
Young Mitchell and Jim Haywards,
both welter-weights, went six busy
rounds. Referee Shuler gave the de
cision to Mitchell, although the latter
was the cleaner and harder puncher.
Fred Landers was given the decision
over Toby Irwin after ten rounds of
fighting:. Landers was the aggressor
throughout, while though he was al
ways trying he seemed to have no
punch. Up to the fourth round there
was but little fighting. In this round
Irwin tried to finish his man. He stag
gered him with a left and instantly
shot out his right. It seemed to have
some reverse English in it, as it
turned Landers completely around and
sent him on his hands and knees to the
mat. He nearly went out of the ring.
Irwin did n<;t follow up his advantage
and Landers kept after him throughout
the remainder of the fight. This gave
him the decision.

The talking for the principals was
done by Charley Mitchell and by .Willis
Britt, with Manager Jim Colfroth of
the Yosemite Club' acting the imrt of
interlocutor: It all went :as smoothly
as though it had been rehearsed. In
, every instance where r there 7 was '; the
slightest question Britt gave way, al
though Mitchell _â¢- said she ' : wanted ; only
fair play and not concessions, w
Jimmy Britt and White '; met' for. the
first time r at the : conference. , They
seemed to look through , one another in
an effort to determine their relative
muscular strength and their vitality.
When they stood back to back White
appeared about half an inch the taller.

left for Harbin Springs, where he will
remain.: two weeks. He will spend all

DIVISION OF PUItSE. r -
The first matter discussed h was the
fighters' percentage. The club gives
them ; 50 per, cent ; of i the 'gross \ receipts.
Britt suggested I that ,: the * winner :, take
75 per cent of this and the loser 25 per
, cent. Mitchell â¢ thought '60 and 40 was ? a'
fair Yf proportion '; ; and c Britt at â¢â¢Â£ once
agreed .to it. On a $40,000 house, which
the ' fight : is ; expected Ito ) draw, the \ win
ner will _ receive t $12,000 and the J loser
$8000. In addition to this Britt will
receive a bonus, which usually amounts
to ; about S s2ooo. / , ,v- . id:.':-. - ,-, ,;.
't The "i matter of weight was ' next
: tackled.": Britt was ? equally complais
ant m this, although on other } occa
! sions he would not give away an ounce.
Mitchell i suggested ! I>or j 2 o'clock ?as-: a
suitable ; timeno) weigh in. Britt ; named
3 ; o'clock. Â£' A? compromise was ; reached
by naming 2 o'clock. . â¢ *. ; ;â Â» "<-.', '-.-.iXV
':â 'â  The I Queensberry "rules were : agreed
upon. Mitchell said it suited White to
protect himself Â£in the breakaways.
He wanted no f wrestling on the part
of the ; referee and no interference with
. the men. ' r, ' ' .: : ' ; -â¢â  * " ''''â¢â  â¢ v: '. . r
:Â» j lt was V decided ,-- to select â¢ the '-. referee
twelve] days Ibef ore the fight. Mitchell
said he would leave it to three of his
friends to 5 select a man on | his behalf.
He named M. A. Gunst S and >f Major
McLaughlin as "; two Sof 5 the men In
whom vhe \ had confidence. Mitchell 5 said
all he wanted I was ?â¢ a referee | with ; a
clean ~ record. '?He i did not want Ito be '
: placed in the position tpÂ£|ref using any
man and then \ have to tell : , his reasons
why. ' â  :
The i question of | bandages ;? was : the
last detail decided upon. Mitchell
wanted no bandage?, possibly thinking
White's small % bony hands would do
greater execution without them. Britt
said g his! brother was accustomed lg to
using | bandages. It was \ finally agreed
that soft surgical bandages be used.

MISTY'S PRIDE IS FIRST,
A NECK BEFORE LETOLA
Exciting Finish to
the Handicap at
Oakland.
Military Man Gives
the Bookmakers
a Jolting.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Misty's Pride, the statuesque blonde
mare from Oregon, met quite a gather
ing of notables in the five and a half
furlong handicap at Oakland yester
day, including among them the cele
brated New York speed merchant, Col
lector Jessup. In distributing the
weights about, Handlcapp3r Egbert
allowed 113 pounds to Misty's Pride,
and even then she had first call at 3
to 1 in the betting. Lctola got in with
105 and was the only one capable of
extending the webfoot wonder. Jakie
Jones, as usual, rode Misty's Pride and
lost no time in leaving the barrier.
Collector Jessup acted as her escort to
the stretch, then excused himself.
"Big Bill" Knapp now blazed away
with Letola, and at the paddock it
looked as if the Jennings mare might
win. But the favorite straightened
out her neck and, responding gamely,
earned a neck decision. Princess
Titania, slow to get away, ran a fair
third, four lengths away. Delagoa
never looked dangerous.
Three favorites, two second choices
and an outsider were returned winners.
The victory of Sir Edward in the first
was an eagle bird, but after that the
layers received an awful drubbing.
Sir Edward, a likely looking son of
Eddie Jones and Motto, took the two
year-old scramble from a big field with
10 and 12 to 1 about him in the ring.
Yolo Girl, the second choice, made all
the running, only losing out at the
wire by a head. Canopa, a 60 to 1
shot, ran third. Travers did not use
any undue diligence in getting the fa
vorite, Fred Bent, away from the
barrier or his mount would have been
closer up than fourth.
Dr. Rowell's gelding Best Man, at
tired in a full dress suit, made his
company in the Futurity course run
following look ragged and care
worn. He ruled a favorite in the bet
ting and breezed in before Redan and
Tarn O'Shanter. Edinborough quit the
last eighth, after cutting out the pace.
Possibly because Flaunt one day
beat Best Man, the Ryan gelding
caught a vast play to win the mile and
a sixteenth selling run. It proved an
ill-advised plunge, for. when the price
about Esherin reached 13 to 5, "Les"
Coggrins climbed aboard his mare.
Travers had the leg up, and she went
out and won all the way. Flaunt
weakened the latter part of the jour
ney and Cinnabar, a 9 to 1 chance,
finished in the place. ,
Both Hugh McGdwan and Ocyroh* 1
were absentees from the mile selling
number. This made the race look a
gift for North West, and all the 11 tÂ«Â»
20 laid was gathered up early. Dora
I and Ethel Abbott made the running
to the stretch. Then Lloyd Fountain
let the first choice down, and the mare
disposed of Meistersinger and Al Wad
dle with apparent ease.
Garnet Ferguson's chestnut horse
Military Man made his first appear
ance since being kicked out of com
mission by W. U. Condon while at the
post for the Burns Handicap. He was
one of half a dozen starters in the
closing Futurity course speed .recital,
and because Eckersall looked so good
on paper the ring chalked 4 to 1
against the Ferguson entry. At post
time 2% was the best. Eckersall, the
favorite, ran up against two fast ones
in Royal Rogue and Robert Mitchell,
the trio burning up the track for two
thirds of the route. Then Wright be
gan mowing" them down with Military
Man, finally winning cleverly from
Judge, another which moved up from
a back row. The favorite finished a
groggy third.
TRACK NOTES.
Travers rode two winners.
Bullman did not show urÂ» to ride
Collector Jessup and was suspended
by the judges. It is understood the
rider left for Memphis last evening.
F. E. Baird is up from Ascot Park
with Dan Collins, Bailey, Freesais,
Lou Merrill and Massacre.
In the string of E. Durker, another
arrival from Los Angeles, are Glen
nevls, Palmist, De Grammont, Ray,
Iras and Metlakatla.
Clarence Waterhouse, looking
brown nn a berry after an extended
stay in Mexico, was a welcome visitor
to the track yesterday.
"Western Al" Smith, whose horse
Orchan won the Ascot cup at Los An
geles, is back. He gave the bookmak
ers down south a good time and ex
pects Orchan to make? it interesting
for some of the distance horses across
the bay. W. Dugan, probably the
most finished rider at Ascot Park, will
be up here next week, and Al will
make his engagements.

There are two steamers bearing the name'

court' r which carries freight and pasÂ»ensera
betwt-en htre and the port in flumboldt County
aJt*-r which shf is raised. She is commanded
by. '_'*: :<-. :r. Jesarn. one |of th- smallest but
moit capable navigators on this coast. - The
iÂ»ther Eureka looks more like a fighting ma
chine than a merchantman. She is a collier
and brings big cargoes of black diamonds to
- this port irora the mines of British .mbia.
Ehc is commanded by Captain Andrew Hall,
who Â» a* master of the steamship Walla Walla
when that vessel was cut down and sunk by
the French bark, Max. Th-? big Eureka is not
here as often as the smaller Eureka, but she
draws more water end makes more dust along

Hazing ury Disagrees.
The trial of Atlee Hunt. Jackson
Hatch Jr. and Arrnin Hansen, the
three students at Hopkins Institute of
Art charged with battery for "hazing"
Albert de Rome on November 18 last,
resulted in a disagreement of the jury
yesterday afternoon. The jury Btood
six to six. A number of electrical ex
perts and physicians were called to
testify for the defense and they all
said that the battery used upon De
Rome would not even injure a chilld.
R. C. Foss, an art student 16 years of
age, gave practical Illustration in
court of the effect of the electric cur
rent on his bare limbs. He smiled all
the time and said he could barely feel
the current Judge Mogan continued
the case till Saturday to be again set
for trial.

bit. Hart then hooked his left to the jaw. but {
in a clinch : Johnson planted . his left to the I
stomach. As the round â¢ neared Its conclusion ,
some one exploded a flashlight photograph '
and the principals Inferred that It denoted the ,
end of the contest. , Such was not the case, j
however, . and the â  referee motioned for the '
men to continue. This they did and the bell ;
rang with . the men â  fighting : fiercely in John- !
son's â â¢' corner. Referee Qreggalns at once de- :
clared Hart the winner.
â¢
WHITE A SPECTATOR.
Jabez "White engaged in no midnight
prowling after the fight, but went di
rectly to his hotel and to bed.
"The only difference I saw between
fighting here and in England Is the '
holding that seems to be indulged in a j
great deal in San Francisco," he said. :
"Our rules prohibit striking when the
men are hanging on to each other. I
have not been accustomed to the tug- !
ging and holding that I saw to-night.
In England the fighters must break '
away on the word of the referee, and
if a blow Is struck while holding on â¢
disqualification promptly follows.
"But in my country it is permissible
to strike when the hands are free. Each \
man must look out for himself in the
breakaway.
"I enjoyed the evening's entertain
ment very much and Hart was cer
tainly entitled to the decision. We j
were somewhat disappointed in John- '
son.
"The fighting was not any rougher
than contests in England. Among a
certain class of men we have as much
rough work as you have here."
Charley Mitchell, who is by no means
a stranger to righting in America en
joyed the evening's sport. He attended
the fight with his son and White.

NEW YORK, March '28. â To-day's stock
â¢Â»*xliet was Â«n afi&lr of constant fluctuÂ«iionm. ;
giving an appearance of uncertainty to the tem
per of the speculation, but the' fluctuations were
mostly below last night's, level. The jOcca
etonal rallies were poorly held and,, the. e.nd of
the dai 6j>owed "the average of prices consider
ably below. last night. The activity was'near
ly on a descending scale 'of; prices, the oc
casional rallies leading ud to dullness and neg
lect, showing ,thfe subsidence, of demand . from
the shorts at the. higher .'level. "Call money
again touched 4 per cent Â«n4. the outlook in
the money market plainly was the" most;di
rect factor in the : operations of the day. Prep
arations were being made for the * subscrip
tion* to the new Japanese loan which Is to be
offered â  to-morrow, a ' $75,000,000' â  Installment-^
being New York's portion. , Those *in charge 01
the offering cralm that' every safeguard will be
adopted to protect - the money ' market I from
disturbance and'- that the operation . will ' be
largely in the nature of a transfer of. book
accounts between banks. But Wall 'street has
an eld experience of- tuch assurances and Is
well aware that an operation of that magni
tude Is not perfected without a necessary
shifting of loans on a large scale. -The amount
of disturbance resulting' in the money market
is likely to be dependent on - the width of the
margin surplus above the. legal reserve require
ments. â  As the surplus is just . now unusually
low for the period of the year, there was some
natural misgiving that the ' money < market
might not escape the spring flurry. In addi
tion to the money situation the market had
to pass another day without any -verification,
or numerous merger or dividend rumors. .A
Southern Pacific dividend 1 had t*en definitely
set down for yesterday, and not being forth
coming there was disappointment on .the part,
of tho element which had bought on that -ac
count. The report that the St. Paul Con
templated an exp-ndlture of 000,000 for an
extension to the Pacific-. Coast was formally
denied by the chairman of the board of. that
company. The denial was effective In induc
ing selling of the stock, although similar de
nials- official or Informal, 'have been made of
nearly all the recent deal rumors. There was
evident unloading also of .Reading on the part
of the recent large speculative buyers of that
stock. - With . thÂ« -speculative favorites, Include
Ing Union Pacific, St Paul, New York Central
and Reading, thus under pressure, small in
fluence was exerted upon sentiment by the
few advances 'in the industrial â â  class, " which
still manifested themselves In a scattered man
ner. London was a heavy seller In this mar
ket, and there â were reports, of a violent dis
turbance on the St. Petersburg Bourse. Paris
was especially affected in sympathy, but the
manifestations were read as a sign of coming
peace, which -Is a development hoped for lit

* I women, members
â¢*â  of Mazzini Circle of the
Ancient Order of Foresters,
were attacked by a masked man
near the corner of Stockton and
Greenwich streets at an early
hour yesterday morning. The
thief took a satchel containing
$66 70, which belonged to
Mazzini Circle of the Ancient
Order of Foresters, from Mrs.
J. Navarro, the secretary of die
organization. The woman pluck
ily clung to the valise until the
highwayman hurled her to the
pavement. The man darted
through a little alley, scaled a
fence and escaped. The satchel
was found later by the police,
and near it was a black cloth
which had been used by the
footpad as a mask. The two
women who were with Mrs.
Navarro are Mrs. L. 7*rr\ and
Mrs. J. Kerr, wefl-known mem

A masked robber snatched a satchel

Mis Navarro left the lodge, which
is in Washington Square Hall, at about
midnight. She was accompanied by
Mrs. L. Zazzi and Mrs. J. Kerr, who
live near her.
Whf-n in- women had almost reached

from a iittle alley. The women heard
hiÂ« footeterÂ»F behind them and turned
around quickly. The lower portion of
the fellow's face was covered by a.
black cloth.
Before any of the women could
serf-am the robber seized the satchel
carried by Mrs. Navarro. She cluug
t" it tenaciously, shouting for help.
Mre. Zazzi and Mrs. Kerr attempted
to seize the footpad, but he pushed
them aside.
Let go you," he hissed, and
swung the woman around in a frantic
effort to get the valise. The handle
broke and Mrs. Navarro was hurled to

sponded. Sergeant Fraher, Policemen
Ward, Armend, Wren. Minehan and
Connelly. The sergeant quickly dis
tributed the men through the neigh
borhood. The satchel was found near
the corner of Stockton, on Greenwich.
The thief had pocketed the money and
thrown the receptacle away. Beside
the valise was found a piece of black
cloth which the robber had used as a
mask.
The robber is described as being five
feet eight inches in height, with dark
hair and eyes. He was rather roughly
dressed and wore a dark slouch hat.
All of the women believe that he is

v as aware that Mrs. Navarro was ac

walked to her home at the same hour
with larger amounts, but had never
before been molested.
Mrs. Navarro suffered some' painful
bruises from the fall, but was not .seri
ously hurt. The other worne* were
not molested. The thief evidently
knew that the satchel contained money
and bent all his energies to getting it.
Detective Matheson was detailed on
the case. He visited the scene of* the
robbery yesterday afternoon, accom
panied by Mrs. Navarro and Mrs. Ztz
zi, and traced the route that the thief
had taken. Mrs. Navarro said:
He came rjght up behind us. Just is I
turned around he caught hold of the valise.
I gripped it lightly and he swung n^ ar.mn.i.
1 screanurt as loud as 1 could, so did th<
other ladies. Finally ithe handle broke and' l
fell to the sidewalk.
He ran away with the valise av,d jumped
over a fence at the back of the alley. \.\v
heard him get over another fence, and then
the policemen came. I have oftjen carried
home larger sums from the lodge, but have
never' been molested. The robber cert.-iinly
knew our habits and must have known that
I carried money..

As the result of the Supervisors'

during April, May and June the Board
of "Works decided yesterday that the
services of several mechanics must
be dispensed with. The fund for re
â  pairs to the City Hall and Hall of
I Justice is exhausted, â¢ and an appeal
I for additional funds to carry on ne

i months was denied. All that the com
! mittee would do was to prorh
j,ise to pass on any requisitions
! made by department heads for ; re
] pairs and allow the bare sum neces
j sary for the work. As a consequence
' four carDenters will be laid off and
/but two retained to do the repair
j work. One of these will be assigned
! to the Fire Department. One plumber,
IM. Hogan. Â»will take A. Bertram's
, place in the Fire Department, and
j Bertram will have to, take chances for
I employment as the occasion may re

WITTMAN
APPEALS
TO COURT
Deposed Chief Brings Suit
for Writ of Mandate to Re
instate Hiril in Office From
W T hich He Was Ousted
HEARING ASSIGNED TO
HUNT'S DEPARTMENT
Fig-lit Is On in Earnest and
Attorney Kahrt Declares
That It Will Be Carried
Forward With All Vigor
Former Chief of Police Wittman yes
terday filed suit in the Superior Court
for a writ of mandate directing the
Police Commissioners to reinstate him
at the head of the department. The
case was assigned to Judge Hunt's
court and the hearing was set for
April 7.
"The fight is on in earnest," said
Attorney Julius Kahn yesterday. "The
Police Commission has been guilty of a
gross outrage in dismissing Chief
Wittman and we shall not submit to
It. I am very confident as to the out
come. The board exceeded its author
ity; its actions throughout the case
were unlawful in rn^ny instances and
there will be little difficulty in show
ing that we were not granted a fair
and impartial trial, as the charter
commands.
"You may say that we shall carry
on the case in the courts to the last
ditch, now that we have decided on
that course. I feel that the merit of
our appeal to the courts guarantees a
successful outcome. In any event the
Commissioners will find that Wittman
is of the kind to fight back with all his
strength when he has been subjected to
outrageous treatment."
The following is the petition filed in
the court by the former Chief:
wrroiAX's complaint.
