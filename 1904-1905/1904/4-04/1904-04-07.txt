noon yesterday that they must
refuse hereafter to break In
"students" on any line -of the

issued a statement in which re
gret was expressed that the rail
road company had not "as
ramed a more conciliatory atti
tude," but no intimation as to
the possibility of an immediate
strike was given in this state

of the union, however, said that
if the company , attempted to
break in new men to-day, with
the aid of instructors, trouble
may ensue.

Immediately after receiving these
answers President Cornelius and Sec
retary Bowling retired and later issued
a notification . to the members of the
union that they must refuse ; to break
in "students" on all lines of .the com
pany.' an order which they at once
agreed to comply with. Just what ac
tion General Manager- Chapman -will
take in this matter he refused to state
definitely last night,. but. intimated that
the company would find . a .â¢ means - of
proceeding with the instruction of new
men to-day.
Meanwhile it had Â¦ been learned ' that
A serious crisis in the trouble be
tween the United Railroads and the
Carmen's Union may develop to-day,
and fears are entertained that if there
is a clash a strike, involving in the
near future other large labor unions of
this city, may be declared.
Yesterday the United Railroads made
a move that readily suggested that Its
officials are prepared for serious trou
ble. In the early part of the day Presi
dent Holland and General Manager
Chapman of the company received a
call from President Cornelius and Sec
retary Bowling of the union, who for
mally demanded that the company im
mediately cease hiring new men.
The demand was promptly refused
and President Holland took advantage
of the occasion to remark that the com
pany intended to continue in the man
agement of its affairs as it deemed
proper and needful. This action was
followed by the president of the, com
pany handing to the representatives of
the union the reply of the United Rail
reads to the communication recently
sent to the latter by the carmens" unioa
relative to a new aereement for the
twelve months, beginning May 1. In
this tetter President Holland, repre
senting the executive committee of th^
company, refused to comply with' the
demands of the union for an advance
in wages and for other conditions bear
ing on the future relations between the
company and its men.
As a supplement . to the original de
mands. President Holland submitted
to the union another form of agree
ment, which provides for a renewal of
the one existing, with the exceptions
of those clause's referring to the scale
of wages and for which he substitutes
a new scale, as follows:

question was clearly set forth in our state
ment of yesterday and there is nothing mor*
to say on that subject except to reaffirm our
intention not to assist tho United Railroads
to educate strike-breakers to take . our places.
We have ceased breaking in "students" and
will maintain that position until negotiations
regarding a new agreement are concluded.
No - serious friction has yet arisen, . we . are
pleased to state, because of our action In this

put into operation eome measure whereby the
employes might be insured exact Justice when
charged with Infractions of rules or when they
presented grievances regarding working con

to . preclude the possibility that it would be
abused, or invoked at all except in important
cases. â¢ '
The refusal of the company to effectively
recognize the union by accepting the -provision
which removed all barriers to the union exer
cising full jurisdiction over employes destroys
the value of everything the officials have sata
heretofore, and repeat in this statement, con
cerning their professed good; will toward ,tne
union. -..;The-. company's general manager, ana
president have repeatedly said that they recog
nized the right of their employes- to Join- the
union, but, ;as.a matter, of -fact, they have for
come time past openly and formally refused
to consent to the exercise of that right, even
going so far, as to, require. applicants for worn
to sign an agreement not ' to Join the union.
Under euch . circumstances It Is Hardly to . De
wondered at that the members of the union se
riously question Â¦ the sincerity of the general
statements Messrs. Holland and. Chapman make
regarding "recognition" of the union and ot
the right of their employes to affiliate with It.

criticism and created greater dissatisfaction
among the men than any other, feature of his

to render service to the company equal in value
to the that given by his associates i In the serv

a^d the wage rate/proposed by the union is
exactly a 10 per cent increase over that in

from the company the power to conduct Its

this refjpect.
Clause 10 will be cladly acceded to by us,

union's request In these respects. In vlew^of
the Ehort time remaining under the present
contract, and of reports of a lockout and re
duction of wages on our part, we desire to
make an open statement of our Intentions as
regards wajtes and as regards the late award.
Before announcing our intention In this re
spect It Is fitting to state concisely the his
tory ot the past two years bearing upon our
relations with each. other. When the United
Railroads took control of its several proper
ties oa April 1, 1902. tit found -the wages paid
on the Market-street line 22 cents an - hour,
with a bonus for long service. This scale was
one of the hlchest paid anywhpre. . The other
lines taken over by the company. were paying
a lower rate and the company then stated
that these lower wages would be raised to
the higher Market-street scale. Nineteen days
thereafter a strike occurred and a demand was
made that the wapcn be raised to 25 cents flat,
that being the highest, rate paid under the Mar
ket -strwt Graduated scale. The company con
ceded this drmand In full,' although . a lower
basis' wouldâ tt "vas and is sure â have been
practicable. This Increase was made (without
any effort at h compromise figure) for the pur
pose of. securing entire contentment among the
men, and to Insure a prolonged period c^peace.
This expectation was nof realised. -Within six
month* further trouble aroFe, and on March' 13.
10W, renewed df man<i* were made, avklng for
a minimum rate of :â¢:: l-.'t cents, per hour up to
W) cents i-w hour. The . company considered
this demand most unreasonable, but agreed to
submit the same to arbitration.- Investigation
showed that the average ,wage paid â¢ in 370
American cities was but IS cents per hour.
Thirty-seven â¢ days were consumed â¢ In- taking
the' testimony In the arbitration procedings and
three days tpent in argument in New York
The clauses in relation to . arbitration. . as
well as the clause obliging employes to Join
the union within fixty days. Involving the ab
dication of this company of its rights and duties
in the management of its business, cannot be
acceded to. The company, as stated last year,
has no lawful right to yield to others the
*Â«lÂ«>ction and dismissal of its employes, and
cannot Indirectly divest itself of a duty im
posed by law. nor arbitrate away, nor sur
render the powers ncce6sary to perform those
duties. It is our duty, as we have stated, to
Â¦elect eteady, nober and trustworthy men to
operate our cars; to make all useful rules and
regulations to govern their conduct, and to
provide Â«atUfactor>' service to the traveling
public And while the company recognizes the
right "of every employe to belong to a union,
the demands, of the association limiting or re
vtrictlng the company In the performance of ltÂ«
duty In the selection, retention or dismissal of
employes are respectfully declined. And we
extract the following from the report of the
Anthracite Coal Commission on this subject:
"Nine â The commission adjudges and
awards: That no pcrscn shall be refused em
ployment, or in any way discriminated
against, on account of membership or non
membcrBhlp In any labor, organization ; and
that there shall be no discrimination against,

bers of such organization.*?.. .-.-.. â¢ â¢
Your proposed agreement is in ten sectionf-.
The first and second propose arbitration In
regard to grievances or complaints. The third
dees away with the wase scale recently fixed
by Messrs. Mahon and Straus; and the third
aiso relates to badges, suspensions ar.d uni-
Ittms. The fourth, fifth, sixth, eevcntii and
r.lrth propose different runs, time-tables, hours
snd wages from those fixed by the award re
ferred to. Tfce eighth pection makes it oblig
attry upon all employes eligible to the union
t* Join your union within 60/ days and makes
it obligatory upon the company to discharge
ail non-union men who are 'eligible to the
utiion. The t<*ith provides that no employe
of this company shall suffer a reduction in
Mf wasrÂ« becase of or through the operation
of this proposed conditional agreement. White
we are again willing to leave to the arbitra
tion at present provided the interpretation of
tr-e meaning of any clause of the contract we
rr.ay enter "into, we cannot leave to any form
ot" arbitration matters affecting employment
and diseharre; and while the company will
treat directly with the duly accredited offi
cers of the union under the recognition given
Ian year, the company cannot treat with
complaints that involve the abdication of the
management and legal obligations of its busi
ness, but irust Etand by the present agree

thank you for promising that whatever wages
shall be finally agrecl upon shall take effect

only permitted these attacks, but encouraged
them.
We have not had a month's pÂ»ace within my
knowledge, and the constant nagging the com
pany has been subjected to can only be ascribed
to the element that is mierepresentting labor
union principles and trying to make it appear
that we *re hostile to all labor unions. Our
statements have been misconstrued and given
a meaning never intended. Words and expres
sions have been attributed to the company that
were mere inventions, and it is apparent there
will be no peace so long as this element, and not
strict union men, act as the representatives of
trades unionism. â¢'-Â¦â¢
/ With these conditions staring us In the face
a few leaders of the carmen seek to vest in
themselves the right to hire and discharge our
employes, for their request in this connection
is just about the same as the demands of last
year, except that they are more carefully
worded. The public was shocked a year ago
at the demands. They now ark that If a man
be discharged on the complaint of any passen
ger â man or womanâ that if the employe feels
that he has bven unjustly discharged, the citi
zen must be brought before a 'court of arbiters
to tell his or her side of the story.- Just im
agine this condition of affairs. . No one would
dare complainâ rito matter what the . offense
might be. Section 8 of the carmen's proposed
contract In effect says: First â Men who have
been expelled, by the union for non-payment of
dues or other reasons cannot remain in the
company's employ.- Secondâ Men who are re- 1
fused- admission to the union. cannot be em
ployed, dyer "sixty days. By this section the
â¢leaders could exercise a supervision over every

ing by refusing to permit such men to Join the
union, and might dhÂ»mlÂ»s any man- they chose
.trnjn- the -company's: service by' merely." aus
'nendihg him or them from the union.. - . .
TO yield' to â¢ such -'a demand would be 'to
subordinate the public service to a control that
could never, be .held responsible for. its mii
takes, would place the company in the position
of shirking- its bounden legal duty, would dis
rupt the service and produce results the evils
Â¦of which must be ' apparent to every man or
woman who will give the matter a moment's

other service In this respect. In conclusion I
can only say we do not expect serious trouble,
nor do we. want It. We do 'not expect to nor
do' we want to disrupt the' union; we do want
pear*, and we do want fair treatment. While
-we do not expect trouble, . we are not unpre
pared for the worst. We are willing to live
up to the award of the arbiters and have
even offered to broaden Ks scope, notwithstand
ing the fact that. wages are. being reduced all
over America, and this notwithstanding the
fact that we are 'paying the highest wages
paid on earth on any equally, large, system to
men in similar employment. ."â¢.Â¦.'

Urril 3Â°. 1^04. to April 30. 1905, would be
as follows: Xo platform men entering the
V-cmpany's employ on or alter April 1, -1003,
Â¦would receive more than" 25 cents an hour.
Men employed between April 1, 1901, and April
1 100.1. would receive 26U cents, and .men
employed rrior to April 1, 1901, would re
cei\"e 27 H cents.
It might be paid that the passage of another
year should, in fairness on a graded scale,
bring promotion to a higher grade." Taking
that view of the matter, platform' men Â«m-'
ployed on and after April 1, 1904, should
receii-e 25 "cents an hour; platform men em
ployed between ADril 1. 1902, and April 1.
Iftrt4. "F.hould receive 28 cents an hour, and
platform men employed prior to April 1, 1902,
should receive 27% cents an hour.
A sliding scale based upon the date of em
ployment rather than the arbitrary date of
May 1 would be decidedly to the Interest rtf
the men. The 25-cent men would thus grad
ually pass to the 26>4-cent grade, ajid in turn
the 26%-cent grade to the 27H-cent class.
This would - result as follows: All employes
to work at 2o cents an hour during the first
year of their Employment. Those employes
who have been In the service more than one
year and under three years to receive 2S'i
cents, and those who have been in the service
more than three years 27>4 cents. The com
pany ' will Btand,.upon the scale of wages
fixed by the award, and give a still more
liberal construction; and will after April 30
next put Into effect the wage scale as follows:
All platform men In the employ of the com
pany for a period of one year and* under shall
be paid 25 cents per hour. X- Â¦/ , . ,
â¢ All platform men in the employ of the com
pany from one to two years shall be paid 26>4
cents per hour.
Three times this company, has given evi
dence of Its desire for Industrial peace and its
willingness to pay for it. AVe have passed
through the experience of making a volun
tary tender of increased wages without, any
demand having bet n made therefor. It Â¦ failed.
We have passed through the period of yield
ing to -the men every cent or wage demand
thsy asked for. It failed. We have passed
through prolonged arbitration, In which an
increase was given to secure 'prolonged in*
dustrial peace. It failed. Â¦
During the last few months conditions
throughout the country have greatly changed,
reductions in wages have been widespread.
As testifying to this we extract the following
from John Mitchell's recent advice that the
miners of bituminous coal accept a reduction
of of-j per cent rather than strike to maintain
the existing -scale. Mr. Mitchell said:
"It Is conceded on all sides' that the apex
of industrial activity has been ' reached and
w.j are slowly moving towafd an industrial
depression. The operators came into the joint
convention eeklng for a reduction in wage*
of 15 per cent. Their proposition was op
posed by us with all the Information and
skill at our command. As an ultimatum from
which they could not be moved they offered
us a reduction from present scale prices of
6.55 per cent. We know how hard it Is to
be compelled to accept a reduction in wages,
but it is better to accept a slightly lower
rate and hold your organization Intact, ready
to take advantage of any improvements which
the future of the trade may show, than to be
foi-ced to accent a greater reduction at the
end of a disastrous strike that may leave our
organization so weakened and demoralized that
ic would be unable to cope with the vast com
binations of capital now engaged In the coal
trade." v -;,' : . :.-.-;"Â¦ "_-.-V
The. Increase volunteered by the company
when it first purchased tha properties ,waÂ» to
eÂ«;urÂ« Industrial peace. The, lncreaa* i three
weeks later to a fiat rate of. 25. cents, being
all your union demanded. - was conceded to se
cure industrial . peace. The Increase granted
by the arbitrators, which constitutes our pres
ent scale was granted for the express. - pur
pose of . scouring prolonged Industrial
peace. The award of . tha arbiters â¢ Is
but a few months old. We > entered
Into a * solemn convention to arbitrate
our trace differences, and, though the result
of that arbitration was a great disappoint
ment- to the company and imposed heavy
additional burdens upon It, . and while since
that time wages have been and are being re
duced t throughout America, â¢ yet with the
awardâ so lately^ mada â Itself pleading for
ita continuance and for Industrial peace, it
would- be- trifling with the publlSSio now seek
a fresh adjustment of this scale because it
failed to comport, with our own ideas.' and
thus precipitate a controversy that must work
great injury to the city and Inconvenience to
the public.
City. On November 3 a decision was rendered
by ihe arbiters â Mesers. Mahon of Detroit, pres
ident international Carmen's Union, and Straus
of New Tcrk. The other arbiter, Mr. Calhoun
of New York, diwented from the award. Â¦
The arbiters found that the carmen's wages
then belnjr paid In San Francisco were from
10 to 15 per cent higher than those paidÂ»lÂ«e
where In America, except on a few small linos
in the 8tatÂ» of' Montana; but in spite of that
finding, to Insure prolonsed Industrial peace,
the award pave to the carmen the. increase
herein mentioned. These wages are unusually
high, but the award said:
"I have beÂ«n largely influenced by
the deslrÂ« and purpose to establish a
permanent peace between the company and
Us employee. . to encourage a spirit of mutual
confidence, etc." Â¦ ., 'â¢*Â«,> ,
FAVORS THE' FQSS BILL
Last night the; executive committee
of the Carmen's Union issued a state
ment., which, however, contained no
intimation as to -what action would be
taken in regard to" the refusal of the
company -to tirant the union's demands.
Xhe tone, of; the. statement was exceed
ingly, mild/ 1 and 'in- it was expressed a
regret that the company had not beÂ«n
a bit -more liberal in its review of the
proposition of the employes.
One of the. prominent officials of the
uaioii stated that no trouble" would oc
cur "for. at least a few da ys" â that is,
not until a further conference had been
held. When the posslblHty of the com
pany attempting to put . "students"
aboard its cars to-day under the care
of Instructors was suggested this offi
cial replied: /-r-'X
"Well, that is a different matter. If
they do that and discharge the union
men there is likely to be trouble."
Several prominent members of the
Teamsters' Union stated last night
that their organization was in full
sympathy with the Carmen's Union,
and if the latter went out on a strike
the teamsters would very likely fol
low and stop the rolling of all wheels
in this city.
Yesterday afternoon a committee
from the Carmen's Union, composed
of J. X. Copus, Robert Keyes and M.
James, held a conference with Mayor
Schmitz. who advised them to go slow
in ordering a strike and to be ex
tremely lenient in exacting com
pliance with the conditions desired to
be Imposed on the corporation.
the company was. shipping J[arpe_quaiÂ»
titles of provisions and stores â¢ tÂ»Â». Its
several carhouses and making dthor ar
rangements â¢ for a possible.demonstra
tion. It was also* discovered "that a
local detective agency had received an
order to place a large'- number. of men
5:i the various hulldlngs of the company
about town, a fact that greatly added
to the anxiety ,cf. -the general public,
which had received the .news of the
action of. the company in the light of
an exhibition Â¦ of determination tc
promptly meet any interference from
any source.

Charles W. Clark of San Mateo,
Frank L. Sizer of Helena and William
Falconer, administrator of the estate
of Edward L. Whitmore of Butte City,
Mont., are defendants in a suit
brought ; in the United States
Circuit Court by the Rosario
Mining and Milling Company, with
head offices at Fort Worth, Tex., to
recover $400,000 for breach of con
tract. The complaint alleges that the
'mining company gave the defendants
an option on the following named
mines in the district of Mina, in Chi
huahua, Mexico: Nuestra Senora del
Rosario, Xanki>r" Anexo La Xina del
Rosario and the Maraquita. and two
water supplies and streams named
Guadalupe y Calco and La Periquera.
In addition an option was given . on
thirty-six million square varas of land
in the vicinity of the 'imine and the ma
chinery of a ten-stamp mill.
It was agreed, according to the com
plaint, that Clark should take posses
sion of the mine on May 1, 1902, for
the purpose of exploring it and that
he was to pay 5400,000 on July' 27,
1903, for the properties mentioned. It
is alleged that Clark refused to carry
out the contract. 'Ls^i

The speaker then took the witness

testimony about the seal bore the ear-
I asked him yesterday whether he was*
ashamed, and Judge Cook Fustained an objec
tion, but the witness would have answered.
No. He is devoid of shame. He has not a
(â¢park of-, honor in hi* decaying composition.
He has not a word of encouragement for the
woman who fed and assisted him in his dis
tress. Instead he endeavors to blacken her.
Creatures like that, covered with the slime
of dirty, rotten, depraved origin., seek to de
stroy others. He is intrinsically rotten and
depraved and his name will - be the eynonj-m
In the history of the city of depravity, rotten
ness and sin.
This woman dragged him from degradation
and the mire and endeavored to instill some
spark of manhood and decency into him.
After his hungry mouth was' fed hÂ» turned
on hÂ»r like a demon or cannibal willing to
sacrifice her to hide his own shame.
She appeared in jaunty style, seemed to
think that it was & holiday affair, she had no
characteristics of sincerity and was evidently
seeking notoriety. She did not Identify Mrs.
Botkin as the woman who purchased the hand
kerchief because she realized the awful re
sponsibility of branding this woman as a
felon. She said that she resembled the woman
who purchased the handkerchief.
Judge Ferral talks of higher law.- but there
Is no higher law than God's law â justice. Mrs.
Almlra Rueff was willing to hang Mrs. Botkin
on quotation marks, and then appeared Mr.
Dunning, a pocket edition of Jeffries, the prtie
fighter, who also knows nothing about the case.
I regret to hold up to condemnation any
fellow-cltl2en. but John P. Dunning Is an
ungrateful man that stung the hand that fed
him.
DENUNCIATION" OF DUNNING.
He next discussed Mrs. Tuchler's
testimony and declared that he had no
inclination to cast aspersion on any
w'tness, but asked the jury to remem
ber her appearance on the stand. He
said:
former trial in reply to a question of
the Judge had said that Mrs. Botkin
was not the woman.
The noon hour having arrived, an
adjournment was taken until 2 o'clock.
Knight's powerful voice was in ex
cellent condition when he began his
address in behalf of Mrs. Botkin after
the noon recess. He said:
Judge Fcrral has said' that my services In
this case were worth JlO.Ono. Before the eter
nal God. whom 1 expect to meet, not one farth
ing of that woman's money came to my pocket.
She is penmlees, alone, forsaken, a derelict on
marks of manufactured evidence and
if it was necessary to get the seal it
was necessary for the prosecution to
get other things.
Expert testimony also came in for
a scoring at the attorney's hands. . He
said: "Expert testimony is in general
disrepute In, the courts throughout the
country. It comes into court with the
dirty pieces of silver in .its pockets and
the .testimony is not as ; to facts, but
to conclusions. It would be. the eighth
wonder of the world if an. expert tes
tified adversely to the side which em
ployed him. Dreyfus was condemned
to Devils Island upon expert testi
mony, and that condemnation shook
the very foundation of the French re
public. Look at the present status of
that case. The expert in that case is
now condemned by his fellow men
and Dreyfus is honored."
After reviewing Dr. Ten-ill's testi
mony for the defense, the letter of
June 17, 1897, and circumstantial evi
dence In general, McGowan concluded
with: "I want you to render a verdict
in this case so that when you wrap
the draperies of the couch about you
to lie down to the last sleep you can
say to those about you: 'Thank God, I
depart this life without thinking that
I wronged any one!*"
At this juncture the lawyer desired
to read from the transcript of Green's
testimony at the former trial, but
Byington objected and Judge Cook de
cided that the reading must be from
the transcript of testimony in the pres
ent trial. He then read from the
transcript to show that Green at the
McGowan then went into the ques

that in all fairness to that witness it

FOLLOWED THE CLOSE <5F THE ARGUMENT WHEN A HOST OF STMPATHETIC FRIENDS SURROUNDED THE AC
CUSED WOMAN IN THE COURTROOM.
Walking over to where his client sat
and placing his hand on her shoulder.
Knight said: -'Mrs: Botkin is charged
with murder. Here is a woman., ac
cording to the theories of the prosecu
tion, who planned murder, and with;
arsenic. She bought two kinds, they I
say, powdered I arsenic and^_. lump
arsenic, which is rarely sold. -What
did she want of two kinds of arsenic?" Â«
Miss Livernash'sjtestimony was here
reviewed relative to Mrs. Botkin's
statement upon being informed that â¢
she was suspected. "It is not true, and -
a statement' of that kind could never \
emante from any brain but one sired v
by a Livernash." Continuing, the. at- \
torney said:

Witness Rosell'also came in for a

I would go down to the very dregs of hell to
save this poor woman from her persecution. I
This derelict on life's'' sea comes to me with no
recommendation but the fact that her father.

even said, . "I hope you will have a. fair trial"."
There you are around.. this woman as you

In concluding, Knight dwelt upon the
inconsistency^of the photographic' en- l
largements.and the fact that the cam-p
era does not always tell the truth/]
"These experts," he said, "are* only Â¦
licensed by the court telling the jury :
to look out for them. They are just j

"Mrs". Botkin believes in this jury, j Â¦
She selected it, and she has never-cast!
one thing in the way. No one has been I

Here Knight referred feelingly to the â¢
silver-haired old mother in Healdsburg, '
I wondering what was to be the fate of ,
her child. This broke down Mrs. Bet

hands and sobbed. Soon after this re

possesses to move the jury and

at the bar and pictured her child

gers to ber ears to avoid hearing: those
portions of her attorney's speech
that brought up bitter memories.
It was not until the close of the
dcy'i proceedings that the sensation
of ine trial developed. During his ar
gument Knight took occasion to ar
raign the Â¦women in court for their
morbid cariosity and lack of feeling
for a defimselets woman. His de
nunciation was bitter, and It xvas not
without salutory effect. For the first
t!me in the case there waa a demon-'

REBUKES FERRAL.
Frank McGowan opened for the de
fen^", and made an impassioned plea
for an acquittal. After declaring that
ihe evidence did not bear out the the
ories of the prosecution, he rebuked
Prosecutor Ferral for seme statements

McGowan paid: "Gentlemen, yester
day Judge Ferral. an honored member
'â¢f an honored profession, indulged in
vituperation and vilification which
the exigencies of the case dJd not de
irand. and I am at a loss to know
-.-hat he expected to grain by such
abuse. We heard a great deal last

Judse Ferral was on his feet in an

He then endeavored to impress upon
the Jury that the burden of proof rests
upon tbe prosecution, and that the de

ST. PAUL, Minn., April 6.â The laws

advantageous to merger interests, in
asmuch as they may be employed to
prevent the Harriman people from get
ting control of the' Northern Pacific.
Laws which once \threatened _ to break
up the combination are to oe employed
in preventing it. This somewhat par
adoxical situation came to light to-day
when. it. was learned that Attorney
General Donovan of Montana, who, had
been hastily summoned to^ St. Paul by
the Great Northern interests, was im
portuned to use the strength of the
Montana laws to prevent the Harriman
Interests, through the Oregon Short

WELL-KNOWN RESORT
IS DESTROYED BY FIRE
Hotel, Cottages and Bathhonses at
Orr Hot Springs In Mendoctoo
County Are Total Ix>ss.
UKIAH, April 6.â Orr Hot Springs.
a summer resort, eleven miles west of
this city on the Mendoclno road, was
destroyed by fire last night. The
cause of the fire is unknown. _The fire
started in the hotel and soon en
veloped the cottages and bathhouses.
The loss will reach $20,000. Within
the past ten years the hotel has been
burned twice.
Owing to other, engagements of coun
sel, the hearing ,was '-, adjourned until
Tuesdfiy r morning next. It is expected
that Miss ; Marion; Doyle,, who. succeed-"
ed -Mrs; Curtis: as Hyde's chief stenog
rapher, c will bring the story told ? yes
terday.down to a much later, date. Miss
Doy le^, was b ne of the Government wi t
n'esses before the ;. Grand Jury i that re
turned; the indictment. .
>' Well; ! you see, -Schneider came around to my
office and -talked 'about hlÂ« plans: for an hour
and ' I , thought Â¦ he was such /a respectable fel
low'he-wouldn't do anything wrong.
Â¦Besides. 'he paid .the ..notarial fees promptly,
did -he not?-- > .
.'-Yes, sir. â¢
.; -The last witness of the. day was d.
Alexander, the notary mentioned by
McCusker. He confirmed McCusker's
testimony and added further evidence
against: Schneider^ as follows :
; Schneider brought me many transfers for me
to fill in < my Jurat. In every case the name
of the, grantee was left blank. . I affixed my
Jurat at' his. request. None of the parties ap*
peared â¢ before me Â¦ to Â¦ acknowledge the asslgn
.ments. . Schneiders promised ' to v Eend Â¦ them
around, but they never came. *â¢.--.
Did you think It right; to do this?
â¢ Last : year a ' young man named . Levinson
came to meMn Portland, saying he was from
Schneider/ and asking me to sign some papers.
These papers contained a declaration that the
lands' were> taken up of my own free will and
that-I had acted In everything; without' any
outside"; pressure. I refused Â¦ to sign because
by this time I had heard so much talk of land
frauds -that I was determined' to have nothing
more 'to do- with Schneider/' I told Levinson
thaMf-the'.Government wanted to know what
I â¢ Knew 51: would tell . everything.
questioning:, and Mrsl Curtis added this
bit of information:
We kept office copies of Hyde's letters to
Forest Superintendent Allen regarding contem
plated, forest reserves. ..In these- letters Hyde
would tell Allen what lands he ' wanted In
cluded in-the reserves. Hyde also had maps
prepared for reserves In Southern and Northern
California and Oregon. In making up these
maps Hyde took care' to have the school sec
tions. 16 and 3C. Included whenever these sec
tions were not already sold to other applicants.
Through his Influence with Surveyor General
WrlRht he- secured precedence for his applica
tions for State school lands.
The next witness took up the story
where Mrs. Curtis left off and told of
Hyde's operations in Oregon, where
J. H. Schneider had acted as Hyde's
agent in 1898. This witness was
Thomas McCusker, who testified brief
ly the other day. McEnerney had only
one question for him yesterday, but
that one at once opened the door to a
wide cross-examination by Heney.
WHAT McCUSKER KNEW.
"Have you ever seen any affidavits,
applications, deeds orother documents
emanating from Hyde or relating to
his transactions In Oregon lands ; that
were false, fraudulent or forged?" was
asked by Hyde's attorney. McCusker
said he , had seen none that he recog
nized,as forged or fraudulent. Then
Heney got out. the following testimony:
-J; H. : Schneider came to Portland with an
Introduction from Mr. Sherman of the San
Francisco house of Sherman &.Clay. He ex
plained his Â¦ plan for acquiring â¢ Oregon school
lands. I- did not then see anything wrong
about . it. and as he offered me $10 for each
application I might bring In .1 agreed to help
him. ,1 had many acquaintances and soon had
the applications coming In rapidly. Every ap
plicant got $5 for signing. Schneider fur
nished all the blanks with descriptions of th*
lands to be located, written by himself. I had
some of - my Â¦ friends . assisting me In getting
signers. (The witness read a long list of sign
ers obtained by him and his canvassers.) Â¦
All'ithe applicants secured went before No
tary D.- Alexander and awore to their appli
cations; 1 1 1 . took I up some land myself and
transferred it to Schneider.
from dictation and which Hyde and Benson
signed in duplicate, each keeping a copy.
How did they get title to the Oregon land??
By the same methods used here â that Is, by
getting persons to sisn applications for the
lands, and when the deeds were made out.in
their name then to assign the deeds to Hyde
or. his agent, Schneider. . I. know this by. the
correspondence which canie to the office and
which I had to file away in the proper boxes
relating to-the different cases. .. . . Â¦ . -,o .
j You . have no knowledge y as . to forgery, in
connection with any of these lieu lands, have
you?
I had some knowledge, but did not see any
forgery committed.
Did you know the defendant Dimond while
In Hyde's office? .
I never paw him there or knew of hlÂ« con
nection with Hyde's business until after I left
the office.
Then the witness was turned over
to Heney for cross-examination. He
questioned her* just enough to bring
out the Government's grounds that the
transactions she had described were
tainted with fraud. Mrs. Curtis testi
rled'In part as follows:
I signed two applications at Mr. Hyde's re
quest. Th* first wan In August, 1S98, for 200
acres in Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Forest
Reserve, Santa Barbara t>junty. I never saw
thl* land. I did not swear to my application.
Hyde paid me $10 to sign, and after the certifi
cate of purchase was Issued In October. 1S98,
I assigned it to him a: his request.
My second application was for 4-10 acres in
the Sierra Forest Reserve. Frtsno County. This,
too. was not sworn to by me. I assigned the
certificate to Hvde in this case also, and re
ceived ?1O. Neither of these assignments was
acknowledged before a Notary.
. Did you not know you were losing: your
school I?.n3. right?'.
Yes; but I was 'working for Hyde and he
asked me, n I Just signed.
. AN AFFIDAVIT -FACTORY.
What was the practice In- Hyde's office with
regard to having the Notary's Jurat put on
affidavits? . â¢ ' '
Most of them w-erc sent out in the hands of
an office boy to a Notary. and came back with
his Jurat on them. This -was a common prac
tice. I saw both Hyde and Schneider send out
bundles of affidavits to be completed tii this
way. Sometimes I was sent to take them to
the' Notary. The applicants were not pres
ent when the. Notary* put his jurat on their affi
davits. The Notary commonly employed- for
this work was Henry P. Trlcou. These affida
vits-were In applications for California -school
lands. Most of. the applications which Stein
secured for Hyde wefe brought to'the'office-'al
ready > signed,- but not'sworn to. -Some of the
negroe3. whom Scott, Â» the Janitor, got : to sign
swot* to, their applications before a Notary..
' Did you .know if was perjury to swear out
an application without having seen the land?' .
I did not know, it, then. I wrote. at Hyde's
dictation many letters to officials of the â¢ de
partment, and also many others., in which the
names of the person addressed were not given.-
These latter letters began simply with- the
words, "Dear < Sir." : Hence they were known
in the office as the "dear sir letters.'.'- .: They
always related- to cases pending in the'Land
Office, but as a rule we did not know to whom
they were mailed by Hyde. Once, however;
I caw hire Rddress such a letter to J. ? J.
Barnes, whom. Â¦ from the contents of the letter,
I assumed to be a Government official. Â¦ / Â¦ .
MONEY TO PUBLIC OFFICERS.
1 Among the State and? Federal officers who
frequented Hyde's office and consulted .with
him behind the -closed doors of his private of-'
flee were B â¢ F.- Allen." then Forest Superin
tendent and Special Agent Prior, both of the
General Land Office; M. J. Wright, then Sur
veyor General of California, - and his son* and
deputy/Frank Wright. V
'Did you ever,' "by direction of Hyde, Inclose
money to Government land officials? â¢ -,-' :?*Â£]
Â¦ Yes; often. ,Some- few,, sent .it back. The j
money was sent to the registers and receivers
of the different land offices" throughout - the
State. - The first Â¦Â¦ time I Inclosed the moneyâ it
was generally $2 â I thought Hyde would, want
It mentioned In the letter I was writing for
him to the of flclaJ. : and so 1. inserted this sen
tence- "You will find $2 Inclosed." But- Hydo
made me â¢ rewrite * the letter, leaving this I out.
He said the money was their perquisite. .
I We got dally, advices from the Surveyor. Gen

SpeclaJ Pispttch to The Call
PARIS. April 6.â It Is denied in offi
cial quarters that, there is - foundation
for the report that Newfoundland will
take steps to enter the Dominion, of
Canada as a result of the Anglo-
French settlement , of the shore and
fisheries questions', which heretofore
had interfered with Newfoundland's
complete sovereignty.
The fact that the Colonial treaty will
be signed at an early date is bringing
out another manifestation of the rap
prochement between Great Britain
and France. The Temps says in this
connection that Great Britain's gain in
Newfoundland is America's loss, but
declares that the United States has
been covetous of the French fisheries
and says France had difficulty In

Thorsch stated to-night that he had
been in the employ of J. B. Whitney
of .120 Sutter street, San Francisco,
and admitted that he was short in his
accounts. He expressed a willingness
to go back to San Francisco to face
â¢any charges which may be preferred
and intimated that others would be
implicated in what he had to tell when
he reaches San Francisco.
"My name is Rene Thorsch. My
home is in San Francisco, where my
parents live at 2392 Pine street. I
hope God will forgive me for doing
this, but it is for the best. It is my
own fault, as I always have had a
good home, but gambling was my un
doing. My belongings are at 1702
South Grand avenue. Please notify
my father, as the shock would kill my
mother."
.The wounds which Thorsch inflicted
are not serious, although he would
have bled to death if not discovered
in time.
Thorsch Is only 19 years of age and
says he came here from San Francisco
to escape prosecution. At 1:45 o'clock
this morning he was found In the
park with his throat cut and his wrisU
gashed. He was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where the surgeons
stopped the flow of blood and pre
vented him from bleeding to death.
On his person was found the following
note:

is to be prosecuted on a charge of em
bezzlement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
This disposed of that tangle and Mc-
Enerney continued the examination,
with the result of almost Immediately
calling from the witness the following
testimony, which alone may hold his
client for trial:
Mrs. Curtie. did. you ever apply for a land
location in California?
, Yes. I signed an application at llr. Hyde's
request. Many others in. the office or near toy
did the same, among them being Miss Farwell,
our: cashier: her sister.-: , Miss - Susie Farwell;
Leon Samuels, an attorney who had desk room
in Hyde's office: Mrs. E. A.- Ellsworth; C. N
Stein, a barber; Mrs. Sarah Stein; .. James
Scott, the colored Janitor of the building, and
many others. Stein brought In a â¢ number of
men to sign applications whose names 1 can
r.ot remember. Â«rfd "James Scott brought "a
great many . negroes, who also signed the
blanks. "Besides "these there! were "a number tf
employes on Hyde's ranches ' who â¢ signed * ap
plications at his request.'; All these apDlIcd
for California lands. " .
What about locations of : school "lands Â¦ In
Oregon? - .... s.-
- Schneider was sent up there byHvdeta get
hold of Oregon lands, ami'llfnson and his son
were in Oregon and Washington themselves
Hyde and Benson were , working - together '-Â¦ in
Interest., . {. Â¦ ' Â¦Â¦ ~. i .:.-. t ~\ Â¦Â¦ \ -,,- . j 1 .
HYDE AXD BEXSOX PARTNERS;
How doyou know this?
Because of the agreement, which I- w'rote' out
"No. * Those notebooks were Mr.
Hyde's property and when I left his
office I left them there and have never
seen them since." " * . :
. "I think it evident," Heney said,
"that defendants are simply "trying to
find out what the Government . can
prove â just what notes this witness
has. As a matter of - t fact, they ought
to have these notes in their own pos
session."
"Well, we haven't," answered Hyde's
lawyer..
A A newspaper in Washington,"
Heney "^continued, "started the story,
that Mrs. Curtis had read her steno
graphic nates before the Grand Jury.
Mrs. Curtis, is that true?" .
"Hold on there." cried Government
Counsel Heney. "This looks like an
other fishing excursion."
"Our object," McEnerney retorted,
"is to show by this witness that 'the
relations between Hyde and Benson
were absolutely inconsistent with the
existence of 'such a conspiracy as is
charged in the indictment and that
there was no conspiracy."
What do you mean by scrip?
Lands that can be used in locating other
lands. He purchased a creat deal of such
land during ttie entire period I was in his
employ. - -v; -
1 first met John A. Benson in Hyde's, office.
There was a private telephone . from Hyde's
Montgomery-street office to Benson's office.
Benson was in Hyde's office vc*.v often, talk-
Ing with Hyde about their land business. 1
remember when they gave pome certificates of
purchase to Crawford W. Clarke as security
for money they borrowed from him. Clarke
was there frequently. I don't know how much
he loamd them. \ once beard Clarke tell Hyde
he didn't care to advance money to Benson
without Hyde as security. Hyde could get all
he wanted from Clarke, and finally got the
loan for Benson. Clarke always took notes for
this money. Afterward the certificates of pur
chase for the California lands located and the
deeds given by the State of Oregon were as
signed to him as . security. There were a
great many of these- transactions, and Clarke
furnished a big" 'lot of money for Hyde and
Benson. Â¦ - . Â» i
Have you your stenographic notes of any
letters from Hyde to Benson?
None in my possession. , : .
A PROMISE NOT KEPT.
The direct testimony of Mrs. Curtis,
given In answer to questions by Gar
ret W. McEnerney, of Hyde's counsel,
was in substance as follows:
I was employed as Mr. Hyde's atenoirrapher
from November. 1S37, to September. 1899. Dur
ing part of this period his office was at 630
Commercial etreet. but It was later removed to
41 ft Montgomery street.
Who were employed there besides yourself?
Hyde's son and two nephews were office
boys. Miss Laura Farwell . was the cashier.
Then there were Joost H. Schneider (one of
the defendants indicted Jointly with Hyde,
Benson and Dimond). a Mies Andrews and sev
eral other stenographers. Mr. Hyde's brother,
11. D. Hyde, was also there part of the time.
What business was Hyde engaged In?
That of a land attorney, buying and selling
scrip and locating land for people. He had a
large daily mail and dictated a great many
letters to me. When I entered his office I
think he had already begun to select lands

M. H. Hechu all of San Francisco, also some
people outside the city. He also bought scrip
on hiÂ« own account. . . ,'j/.
The star witness yesterday was Mrs.
Belle A. Curtis, formerly: chief stenog
rapher in the office of Ficd A. Hyde.
She told only part of what he is said
to know, but that was eaough to cause
every person in the courtroom to give
breathless attention. In brief, her di
rect testimony In answer to McEner
ney's questions, and still more her re
plies to Heney's cross-examination,
amounted to this â that F. A. Hyde and
John A. Benson were partners by
virtue of a signed agreement in the
business of obtaining fraudulent titles
to school lands of the States of Califor
nia and Oregon and exchanging them
for good titles from the Federal Gov
ernment; that the State rands were ac
quired by the wholesale use of dum
mies and forged affidavits, and that in
this work they were aided by State and
Federal officials, some of whom were
named by the witness and accused of
collusion with the alleged conspirators.
Mrs. Curtis' testimony was followed by
other evidence In similar tenor, and it
will be further corroborated, it is un
derstood, when the hearing is resumed
next week.
A DAMAGING -WITNESS.
Some , very sensational- testimony
was given yesterday against Defend
ants Hyde and Dimond in the great
land fraud hearing, and it was given
by witnesses they had themselves call
ed to the stand. Blocked by the ad
verse rulings of Commissioner Hea
eock upon their repeated demands that
the Government produce the evidence
upon which the Indictment - was re-,
turned, the defense found that Its only
way to discover the prosecution's casfl
was to let the Government witnesses,
whom they, have been calling In'.rota
tion, tell what they really knew. So
there was a change In the tactics of
defendants' counsel yesterday. Instead
of continuing to ask merely negative
questions as to what the Federal wit
nesses, were sure not to know, Mc-
Enerney." Schlesinger, Wheeler and
Knight opened the bag wide and the
cat came out. â¢ Now they know the
worst, or some of it, and will prepare
their case to meet it. â¢ â¢ â¢ -'

., OAKLAND. April 6. â Alameda and
Contra Costa counties are going to
dwell in sweet harmony at the World's
Fair at St. Louis. The interests of the
two counties are identical, their in
dustrial and_commercial advantages
are the same and their mineral and
agricultural products are alike, and so
it has been decided "by the local com- |
missioners of the two; counties that
they would work together. This has
been done and the^ commissioners
have gone to St. Louis together to in
stall an exhibit, all the material of
which was shipped at one time. The
commissioners from Alameda , County
are Theodore Gier, W. H. Weilbye and
Wilbur - Walker; the commissioner
from Contra Costa County is H. C.
Raap, County Tax Collector, and the
gentleman who will have the -exhibit
in charge during the fair is Webb N.
Pierce. of Oakland. _/ o -V
The [commissioners have been at
work for several months collecting ex
hibits, preparing literature. and secur
ing headquarters that will be not only
a depository for the products of the
two counties, but will, serve as head
quarters for the people from- Alameda
and Contra Costa counties who will
visit the fair. . This was done through
the efforts of W. H. .Weilbye, who is
an architect and builder, and he was
the one who prepared the design and
will superintend its construction. The
building will be done in St. Louis/
This exhibit is very comprehensive.
It covers the varied industries and
products of the two counties and filled

and one from Contra Costa.

Â¦"The law is a sound one, and aims
to take care of the city's garbage in
a modern sanitary *way." explained
Mayor Olney after the conference.
'"The ordinance is on the books, and
it. like all ordinances of the city, must
bÂ« continuously enforced". There is no
reason why the police should relax in
this or any other ordinance that is the
law of the city. If the scavenger*,
?hall continue to collect the garbage
in defiance of the law the police must
arrest them, and the Chief of- Police
has been po instructed."
â¢In the Police Court this morning the
cases of the two scavengers arresteu
yesterday were continued until April
11. The scavengers say they will force
a test of the ordinance's validity
through the defense of the?e cases.
ccrnatory company Insisted upon Its
'egal right* to take the garbage and
L-jrn It tit its worka on Wood street,
v\ hich were opened on April 1.
' ThÂ« Scavengers' Union decided to re
.-Jst the new company jand to continue
in business. The members declared
ihf y would fight the ordinance through
the courts, and would neither stop col
lecting nor emptying their garbage
oarts at the forbidden place. The ortjer
of the Board of Health was not recog
nized, because the scavengers said they
were dumping their collections on pri
vate property with the permission of
the owner, Whyte Grondona. They fur
ther asserted that they could not be
ttopped from emptying their wagons,
because the new ordinance did not
specifically prohibit garbage dump-
Ing.
The first day of the new company's
operations was signaled by the taking
of names of many scavengers who
Â¦were not obeying the order, but war
rajits were not issued for any of these.
A doubt was raised whether the situa
tion could thus be met. By a change
of tactics the police made two arrests
of scavengers for collecting the gar
bage. The new ordinance specifies
that onlj* authorized agents of the city
shall collect the refuse, and under the
ordinance the Pacific Incinerating
Company is the only authorized agent
of the city. But for some reason not
yet apparent the Chief of Police quit
enforcing the ordinance after arrest
ing only two of the scavengers.
This was the situation when an infor
mal conference was held this afterr
r.oon. Mayor Olney and City Attorney
McElroy sitting as, Police Commision
ers. >
The Board <>f Police and Fire Com
missioners UjIs afternoon issued orders
to Chief of Pcllee Hodskins to enforce
the new garbage incineration ordin
ance, and to arrest all scavengers con
tinuously who shall keep on collecting
rrfuse in violation of the law. This
action was tnken because the police
making arrests after two scav
engers had bo^n taken Into custody.
Attention of the Commissioners was
railed to the cessation cf police en
forcement of the ordinance by repre
sentatives of the Pacific Incinerating
Ctomp&ay, which, ur.de? the ordinance,
has the exclusive right to collect and
t.j destroy the c!ty"s garbage. Despite
the order of the Board of Health clos
ing the dumping grounds, the scaven-
Kpre continue to make their accustom
ed rounds and to Rather and deposit
:heir collections at the same old place
on the West Oakland marsh. The

: "I mot the two fellows at Bancroft
and, Fulton streets on ray way to the
postoiiice," he said -to-day.. "When I
repassed the corner I saw only one
man. He advanced toward me with
a* pistol in his hand. Just then I was
struck from behind by a man I had
not seen. I can't recall whether the
man with the pistol said anything or
not until I told him to get away.
Then he said. 'Keep still; keep still.'
Some people came along then and
scared the men away. They had not
had a chance to rob me. I walked
a block; toward my home, but fell at
Fulton street and Durant avenue,
and remembered nothing more until
I found myself at home again." .:,;,
â¢ This is the first real hold-uo that
has taken place in Berkeley /for a
long time. There is some fear that it
means the repetition of the relgrn of
terror of a year ago, when people
were held up every night or so. The
attack on Sharwood indicates that the
highwaymen would not stop, at .mur
der. With only three policemen . to
guard this town of 20,000 people the
Thugs may have a moonlight picnic
any' time they choose. *
William J. Sharwood, the Instructor
at the University of California vrho
was sandbagged by two thugs at mid
night last night, recovered sufficiently
from the shock of his experience to
thiy to give a more detailed account
of the attack u^on him. Sharwood
was so dazed- after the attack that he
fell unconccious after walking a block
toward his home, and at first It was
thought that his skull had been frac
tured. Fortunately it turned out that
the blow only caused a deep incision
of In? scalp. "

Several lumber dealers addressed the
board and stated in extenuation that
they had not sufficient' yard room for
their lumber and were compelled to
use the sidewalks. The board informed
the dealers that all lumber obstructing
sidewalks must be removed therefrom.
The bo*ard considered the report of
the Bureau of Engineering that two
contractorsâ J. G. Harncy and A. B.
Clu^eâ had signed up the property own
ers for private contracts for improv
ing Clement street from Second to
Sixth avenue. Both petitions con
tained in, many instances the same sig
natures, and what added to the com
plexity of the situation the Board of
Works itself had proceeded tu do the
work on the crossings under . public
contract. After discussing the matter
it was agreed between the two con
tractors to divide the work up.
The board adopted a resolution that
it is expedient Â£o improve Nineteenth
avenue from Trccadcro Gulch to Ocean
avenue, the land of which was^deeded
to the city by the Spring Valley Wa
ter Company, the estimated cost being
$2500.
The temporary employes were ap
pointed for a period of thirty days, with
the exception of those in the /school

H. Coney, city editor of the Evening
Bulletin, died last Friday morning
after an illness of only six days, begin

Among the passengers that arrived
here yesterday on the liner Ventura
was A. E. Watson^ Commissioner from
Sydney, New South - Wales, to the St.
Loufs Exposition, jj Mr. Watson . repre

cago Fair, and has had other experi
ence in this kind of work. Part of the
New South Wales exhibit is already at
St. Louis. The remainder accompanied
Commissioner Watson on the Ven
tura.
The feature of the exhibit will be a
series of object lessons on the wonder
ful agricultural resources of the col
ony, which never showed to better ad
vantage than this yearâ a response to
the welcome rain. ,

cludes-corn.-or maize, seventeen, feet
high and wheat stalks six feet tall.
Thirty-five bushels to; the acre is the
average wheat crop where these stalks
wero gathered. In addition to ' agri
cultural' specimens, the exhibit in
cludes many curios of historicaljnter
est. Commissioner Watson offered to
take some aborigines to St. Louis, but
the fair management did not encoup
age the idea and he. abandoned it.
The rain, which came to New South
Wales after many months of. drought,
has worked agricultural miracles, and,
according to Mr. .Watson, the colony
never harvested such big crops as those
being gathered to'-day.

It \ is no ; less interesting than significant that not : a
single member of the California delegation in Congress
figures discreditably in the various reports upon official
dishonesty . in ; connection with the postal frauds. They

'another of those phases of public lifethat win applause!
THE House has been entertained and the country
interested by an issue-making speech from Con
gressman Livernash. When Livernash makes an
issue all other issues hunt their holes. His issues are
made with a club, cut out with a cleaver and hammered
into shape with a maul. When finished they are wonder
ful to look upon, and fearful. His special issue was the
closed shop for American labor. Taking the Miller case
as a text, he went at President Roosevelt like an indict
ment of many counts. His argument was a mixture' of
prophecy, and war whqbp, and language came: from
him like .the gory -mixture of lean and fat that flows
from a sausage machine.
Being the champion of equal? rights for all,^ or. as the
legend appears on the title page; of Mr. Hearst's cafn^
paign biography, "Equal opportunities for all: special
privileges for none." he raised his. frenzied i arm and
clenched fist against the President for saying that places
under the civil service in Government employ are ! open
to all who" can pass the examinations, get certified fon
the eligible list and be called by the nominating officer^
because that is the law. Mr. Livernash requires the
President to hold,' notwithstanding the; law, that such
placesVare ; open only .to those who, are members of
tain organizations having the power to' deny membeT

United States in which diving armor Is
used. It is the abalone fishery of this
State.
The abalone is a shellfish which
grows so firmly, attached to rocks that
it is quite Impossible to tear It off- with
any automatic apparatus that : has yet
been devised. The only way in which
the abalone can be taken. is by diving
down to it and separating it from the
rock Â¦ with a chisel. !
The shellfish 'used to be ' gathered iby
divers, mostly Japanese and . Chinese,
who dived* without suits, and at times
these men got their hands into the open
shell of an- abalone/ which would "then
close on them I with the result thatbe
fore they could free ? themselves : they
would drown.
Now. the divers go down in regular
rubber armor, and' as! they can work
in ' from twenty to twenty-five feet
of water - and ' remain down : any de
sired time they make much bigger

views of a ship doctor in the following
words: "Many travelers are in doubt
as to the position of the ship's doctor
in regard to his remuneration from
passengers for services rendered. The
merchant shipping act enacts that
every foreign going vessel having 100
persons on board or upward shall carry
on board as part of her complement a
duly qualified medical practitioner.
Furthermore, an emigrant ship â L e.,
a foreign going vessel which carries
fifty or more steerage passengersâ must
have a medical man Irrespective of the
number of crew or of other passengers
carried. The salary of the doctor on
board Is commensurate with these du
ties to his ship. To any passengers
who are suffering from ordinary forma
of seasickness and Its concomitant
evils or who receive injuries which are
in any way due to the ship the doc-Â«
tor's services are free. For any sick-*
ness contracted before sailing' or dur
ing a voyage which Is not connected
with the above named conditions ho
is entitled to a remuneration at the
same rate as he would receive on shore.
Obviously It would be as .unfair., to
expect that his services to passengers
should be rendered gratis as It would
be for any visitor in a hotel or traveler
on a railway to expect to have" medical
attendance free in any illness for which
the hotel or railway authorities couldi
not be held responsible."

for war purposes. It became interest
ing to know the value of a yen. Japan
has a gold standard; but the yen is
of , silver currency and fluctuates with
the pric? of silver, so that at this time
100,000,000 yen scarcely means more than

The yen is divided into 100 sen; the

Kentz put his own whistle to his lips
and answered, at the same time hurry

sound seemed to come. Again came the
sharp call and once more the patrol

no nearer to the mysterious whistler.

the sergeant could be, he caught the
flash of a star as a man in uniform

THE California . State Board of Trade has com
pleted arrangements for an excursion of California
business men to St. Louis, leaving this 1 city on May
13. The purpose of this is to have the most efficient and
intelligent aid possible in making at the St. Louis Expo
sition a demonstration of the interest existing in this
State in the vital matter of having the advantages of
California fully understood.
Many measures have been adopted in the same direc
tion. California has appropriated. $130,000 and has in
trusted to two commissioners the task of having a State
display at St. Louis that shall do credit to the common
wealth. The counties of California have supplemented
the appropriation of State money by raising large sums
and by making large collections of products to have
their localities represented. San Francisco is arranging
to have its own building on the model street, and to place
on exhibition therein much that is of interest, calculated
equally to instruct and to please.
The announcement by the (California State Board of
Trade is pleasing. Great advantages must accrue to
California by having its business men visit the exposi
tion in a body sufficiently large to make an impression.
Mr. Fletcher, the secretary of the California State Board
of Trade, reports that many prominent business men
have expressed their intention to go with the party.
Leading people of Honolulu have engaged accommoda
tions on the special train. The indications, therefore,
are that there will be no lack of business excursionists.
At St. Louis they will meet with visitors from every
part of the world. The world's keenest observers and
most logical thinkers will be there, intent upon learning
and ready to take advantage of all information to be ob
tained. . m N
To such the California business men will have a mis
sion. Conversant with every material interest in this
State and representing every section bounded by Cali-*
fornia State lines, they will carry the weight of authority
and possess trained readiness in imparting facts. The
hope is .expressed by the State Board of Trade that
Â¦every merchant, manufacturer and producer, owner of
realty or other person who has enthusiastic interest and
confidence in California will be in the party to travel
under the board's management.' There will be no limit
to the size of the special train. It will have cars enough
.to accommodate all. , â¢ < .
The California State Board of Trade has the facilities
for making such an event one. of State importance. The
board has been engaged many years in advancing, by
every legitimate means, the welfare of California. It has
connections in the counties of the north, south, coast and
central' portions of the State." It is well supplied with
literature, with data of all sorts, with facilities for im
parting, essential .facts, and it is widely known in. the
East by reason of the extensive correspondence it has
maintained since it was organized for. the public good.
Its reputation has been strongly established by conser
vatism in statement and ability to supply accurate infor^
mation to all inquirers. . . < i7..; : '
The business men will be welcomed warmly at St.
Louis. By the time they arrive at the exposition the
installation of exhibits will have been largely if not en
tirely completed. The splendid buildings of the great
fair will be crowded with thousands of eager spectators.
The exposition season will still be so new that no one
will have had time to grow weary. Interest will be
keen and' piqued by the freshness, novelty and magni
tude of countless attractions. The season is also climati
cally well selected by the'State Board of Trade. Cali
fornia's State building of mission architecture, standing
on. a hill, and San Francisco's building, modeled after
the ferry building at the foot of Market street in this
city, will have become landmarks. The fame of Califor
nia will have been materially extended by the; displays
in these structures and in the great departments of agri
culture, horticulture, mines and mining, education â at
all points, it* brief, where there is a collection of. exhibits.
I There will be many intelligent questions to be asked, and
it will be to the interest of California to have them an
swered correctly. So the business men ,who go on the
excursion to be conducted by the California State Board
of Trade will,' while they kre enjoying a fine outing, have
opportunities to benefit California that ought not to be
1 neglected. .
FOR GREATER CALIFORNIA.
Several years before the Canterbury
Tales had even tentatively revealed,
themselves to their author, Chaucer
found himself called upon in his func
tion of i>oet to the courtâ for which
tradition pays he received dally a
â¢pitcher of wine and various other per
quisitesâto celebrate in verse the be
trothal of Kins Richard II and Anne
of Bohemia. He was working at that
prriod upon his "Troilus and Cres
eyde," and of course was obliged to
lay that remarkable poem aside in
compliance with the royal command.
But the result of this step into the
realms of e^ithalamia was by no
means perfunctory, for in "The Parle
ment of Foules," Chaucer gave to the
English -f peaking world a flight of
famy which has not lacked imitators
during the five centuries of its exist
ence. Its motive was the assembling
ot birds on St. Valentine's day. and its
theme their debate as to which one of
her suitors was most worthy of the
beautiful "formell -eagle," in which
guise was represented the prospective
bride of England's monarch, who fig
ure? a? the â¢royal eagle." It is this
poem which is brought to our
present and immediate attention by
its iÂ«=ue as the latest volume in the
PJverslde series cf limited editions. It
reveals itself to the casual eye as one
of the bes=t. most artistic and hand
somest examples of modern book
making prepared under the direction of
Mr. Bruce Rogers, and a close exami
nation simply intensifies and deepens
the impression made by a first glance
at its pages. The volume forms a thin
octavo of twenty-seven pages, and in
general appearance is designed as an
imitation of the French Gothic books
ot the fifteenth century, the printing
Ijcing done from fac-simile Gothic type
procured in Tarts. It is printed on
unbleached hand-made paper, with
rubricated page numbers, Initial letters
and paragraph marks, the two main
divisions? of the poem being indicated
by two illuminated Initials printed in
blue and heightened with gold. The
binding is in vellum boards, with the
vitle stamped in gold.
Except in the manner of its telling
:-.nd in 'the style of its English verse
The Parlement of Foules" is. of
course, not wholly original with Chau
i-er. It owes something, perhaps, to
the â¢â¢ParlTnens ties Oiseaux" of Marie
<le France, and woven into its fanci
ful conceits are ideas from the Som
nium Scipionis of Cicero, a description
of the Garden of Love from the "Te
seide" of Boccaccio, and an account
of Nature and her birds taken from
the Planctus Naturae of Alain de
rifle. Thrre are also suggestions of
Dante in the poem, but despite these
borrowings from foreign sources and
alien languages, it is as thoroughly
Chaucerian and English as are the
Canterbury Tales, and as clearly in
dicative of its author's progress in
knowledge and art.
The lyf no phort. the craft so Ion* to lerne.
Tttassay so fharp. eo hard the- crtnquerynee.
.These lines have become a part of
proverbial English speech .and . no
matter how often one may have read
the poem with which they open, one
will be certain to read it at least once
more in this unique, edition. Every
page of the volume suggests the early
days of English- literature and the
hours when the art of printing was,
although in its infancy, an art prac
ticed for its own and for beauty's sake
more than for the vulgar spreading
broadcast of printed sheets of paper.
To turn the pages of "The Parlement
of Foules" in its present guise is
something to be anticipated with es
prciaj pleasure by every genuine bib
liophile. The text, of which there are
fourteen manuscripts and one printed
edition (Caxton's) In existence that
rerve as authorities more or less com
plete, is in this instance based on the
manuscript. Gg. 4.27 in the Cambridge
University library. Three hundred and

The different phases through which
the American novel has passed during
recent years Â«ire vividly described in
an article by Robert Bridges In Col
lier's Weekly (March 12). ."It is a
very big country." he observes, "and
the appetite for fiction seems to be as
big bs the country. Millions of peo
ple must be fed with it and the pur
veyors of fiction, like expert cooks,
arc put to it to invent new dishes.
Some one concocts a new and tooth
some appetizer and straightway it be- !
ooincs the fashion. Then all the minor
pantry cooks roll up their sleeves and [
try to imitate it." We quote further:
â¢\Mor*Â» than a decade ago the State
novel became popular and we had
novels of Virginia, Louisiana, Geor
gia. Kansas, California â and so on
through the States and Territories.
Then a race element was Introduced
in dialect form, and negroes, Creoles,
Hoosicrs, Yankees, Chinamen, Irish
men, T-Koea -and 'Greasers all found
themselves" speaking strange and out
landish tongues in the pages of fic
tion. â¢
"When the confusion of tongues
prew oppressive the great American
business f**nse asserted itself and men
and women were revealed in fiction as
affected by the 'idols of the market

WE had something to say recently about the
Northern California citrus belt, and the produc
tion of citrus fruits north of the Tehachapi. This
was made necessary by the comments of the Los An
geles Times on the year book of the State. Board of
Trade, in which the, fitness of the Northern fitrus belt
had been referred to.
Now comes the Pacific Fruit World, published in Los
Angeles, with this further reference to the subject:
"There is a peculiar idea existing in the minds of
some" very intelligent people that oranges cannot be
raised in Northern California, and when you tell them
that 2346 carloads of the possible 30,000 output were
raised and shipped from Central and Northern Califor
nia, they look at you as if they thought it was a Russian
war dispatch sent by the way of Paris. And again when
you tell them that the oranges arc a month earlier than
those from Southern California they seem inclined to
sa3', 'You're another.' Nevertheless the fact remains,
and while they are consumed in the State, yet the success
is so marked the planting of orange trees is not merely
a fad in the counties north of the Tehachapi, but a gen
uine business, because there has been a gain of 508 car
loads as compared with two years previous." -
This may be regarded as settling the matter, and as
an admission of the capacity of the Northern citrus
belt, and of the fact also that its pro/iuct is the earliest
to ripen. These things being adjusted, it remains for
all the citrus growers, from Oroville to San Diego, to go
forward and increase the State's output from its present
30,000 carloads a year to the 60,000 carloads which can
soon be produced, and by studying markets and trans
portation get such facility in handling the crop as to
make every tree yield a profit. The California orange
can be made as common and as much sought in the
American market as the apple was fifty years ago. The
growers have recently had a conference with the rail
road companies on the question of rates and routing.
The growers asked for the same rate on oranges as that
on lemons, which is $1 per hundred pounds.
A railroad officer in the conference said that he under
stood that the lower lemon rate had not furnjshed any
relief, and that lemon orchards were being grubbed out.
To this Mr. Naftzger replied that the lemon business is
profitable only on a large scale. Lemons in the same
orchard ripen every month and every day in the year, in
California, and are profitable only when raised in blocks
large enough to warrant the employment of continuous
labor, in every department of the business. He declared
that large lemon plantations are in a most prosperous
financial condition, and if any trees are being taken out
it is in the case of small plantations. But he added that
the growers on a small scale, when associated in the
same region, are adopting the plan of associated employ
ment of labor, which enables them to make the same
profit. as the large single orchards.
These are important revelations. Most of the agricul
tural industries of the United States; employ labor fit
fully. It is needed in seed time and at harvest, and be
tween times the demand slackens. An industry that re
quires continuous and unbroken use of the same volume
of labor is most desirable, and if the transportation rate
on lemons result in the expansion of that industry, the
railroads, by conceding that rate, have made an impor
tant contribution to the welfare of the State, in giving
stability and continuity to the employment of labor. " ,
Citrus fruits are less perishable than deciduous fruits.
Their keeping quality permits a better accommodation
to *.he demands of the market, and the supply can reach
a more distant demand. When the isthmian canal is
i ; nished, there is no reason why California citrus fruits
! may not seek a market, in Europe. Before our produc
tion was an appreciable quantity in the market, fruit
steamers loaded with the oranges and lemons of Sicily
and passed through the Mediterranean and crossed the
Atlantic to supply the American demand. Fast steamers
can load with these fruits at San Francisco and South
ern California ports, for the British Isles and Continental
! ports, and 'reach the market at a season when it is bare
of the European product. A study of markets and
methods will probably finaHy utilize profitably, every
acre of the two California citrus belts, and give, the State
Â¦ the full benefit of its longest orange season in the world.
i There is no reason why. there should not be trans-'
j ferred to this industry, its interests and its. products the
I same zeal that once ran to gold mining in this State, and
then to stock raising and after that to wheat farming.
Each of those industries was organized and took hold
upon finance and credits, and was felt by the bankers
and business men of all kinds. Having the climate, the
water lor irrigation and the skill to produce, an indus
try that had no standing twenty- five years ago and now
exports 30,000 carloads a year has in it the most im
pressive possibilities.

The purpose of Mr. Dawson's book is
to show that there is a strong cult of
Matthew Arnold, and why this cult
must prevail. Briefly, this cult stands
for idealism. Matthew Arnold was a
man who combined with poetic insight
the judgment of the thinker and the
practical sense of the world of affairs.
A book of unusual interest is prom
ised in the near future by Ahe Put
nams, devoted to the philosophy of
Matthew Arnold. The title is "Mat
thew Arnold, an Exposition and a
Criticism." The author is William
Harbutt Dawson. who has already
made a name for himself, especially in
Kngland. for his previous works, which
include "German Life in Town and
Country," in the popular "European
Neighbors'* series.
A new generation has arisen since
Matthew Arnold was as a voice crying
in the wilderness. Already the censure
which divided the praise bestowed
upon him during his lifetime has been
forgotten, with the more acute of the
controversies which he provoked, and
the Â«ssufts involved can, therefore, now
for the first time be weighed dispas
sionately.
"Hamlet of Denmark and Don

"The animal kingdom having ceased

the vegetable era of fiction. Wheat

ris, hemp in James Lane Allen, cab
bage in Miss Hegan. Tobacco has just
been exploited in Miss Glagow's novel,
'The Deliverance.' It is related by di
rect descent with several other fash
ions in fiction; it is a Virginia novel,
of the reconstruction era, of the cava
lier race, with a dash of negro and
poor white. But these are all sub
sidiary to the tobacco motifâ not plug
or fine cut. or Wheeling stogie, but
growing tobacco in the field, before
the hail has perforated it or frost has

Having exhausted all countries,
races and times, says Mr. Bridges,
there was a lull, during which Amer

fields of activity. Then Kipling made
the animals talk and straightway
"animal books" became the fashion
and vrere turned out by the hundred.
The writer concludes:
"When the present was exhausted
the past began to yield up its stores.
The historical novel ran like wildfire
through the studies of ambitious au
thors. â¢ â¢ ? The critics could not
say anything, because when they

and â¢ his baby daughter, aged 18
months, were shot by the wife and
mother Tuesday night and the child

Rea was temporarily insane when she
made the murderous assault. | Rea
was cut also . on the., cheek and hand
with a razor. The stories told as to
the cutting and also as to the v cause
of the shooting are conflicting.
Neighbors were attracted to the Rea
home by shots and cries for help and
found Mrs. Rea lying in the front
yard In a semi-conscious, condition.
Rea and the child were lying on the
front porch, both very faint from loss
of blood. Doctors .were summoned
and Sheriff Buckner and '. Constable
Goodrich took charge of Mrs. Rea, as
it was feared she might do further
harm when she regained conscious
ness. . .

SOLDIERS GO TO SAN JOSE.
Major" Bigelow and his squadron of
the Ninth Cavalry held field exercises
on the golf links yesterday morning.
The time was given over entirely to
practice in estimating distances, and
while of great value to the partici
pants, the work was lacking in inter
est to the big crowd of spectators,
who are accustomed to* expect a spec
tacular display when the colored
troopers are on the field. In the drill
yesterday Major Bigelow, with troops
M and I, was stationed on a promi
nent point on the links, while Captain
Nance, with tix>op K, occupied a spot
back of the Marine Hospital. Signals
were exchanged^ both by flag and bu
gle, and both were successfully under
stood. In the meantime troop L had
gone to the top of Lone Mountain and
also signaled. Finally Captain Nance
moved over to the Francis Drake
Cross, a distance of 2850 yards from
the observatory point on the links, and
here the bugle "call to arms" was dis
tinctly heard by both troops.
A general search of the neighbor
hood took place and Boyle was found
later on hiding in the* backroom of a
saloon, drinking a glass of bock beer.
He was arrested again and put back
in the guardhouse.
Sergeant Boyle of M Company,
Eleventh Infantry, was locked up In
the guardhouse for being absent from
duty and some other minor offense and
when an opportunity offered yesterday
morning he boldly dashed through the
open doorway and made a-wild break
for liberty." So sudden was the move
that the sentinel who was pacing up
and down hardly realized what had
happened until he saw his prisoner
fleeing down the drive toward the Lom
bard street entrance to the. post. He
shouted to him to halt, but as Boyle
only sprinted all the faster the sentinel
drew his revolver and fired at him.
Boyle was now fleeing toward the
street. The sentinel again blazed away.
The shooting and shouting of the sen
tinel brought Sergeant Murry of Com
pany K, Tenth Infantry, sergeant 'of
the guard, upon the scene and he also
joined in pursuit of the fugitive. In
the meantime Boyle had reached Lom
bard street and was tearing toward the
city.
The commotion caused by the yelling
and the shooting brought out the resi
dents of that section from all quarters,
many of whom Joined in the chase.
An automobile - dashed around the
corner into Lombard street, which af
forded a shield for Boyle and put a
stop to the firing. The fugitive disap
peared from sisht.
FOUND IN SALOON.
The model camp and the vicinity of
the Lombard street entrance to the
Presidio was thrown into a great state
of excitement yesterday morning by a
prisoner attempting to escape, followed
by a sentinel firing a number of shots
after him. Â¦ â¢ .
Rolph & Co. of this city were her
managing owners. Her commander
was Captain John Lass, who has a
wife and three children in this city.
It is some time since the Kailua was

Friend* of Isabella Are Worried on
Account of Her Ad
vanced Age.
PARIS, April 6. â Former Queen
Isabella of Spain is suffering from a
severe attack of influenza, which
causes anxiety on account of her ad
vanced age. She was born in 1S30.
SPAIN'S FORMER QUEEN*
ILIj WITH INFLUENZA
Shipping men surmise that she may
be either the schooner Kailua or the
barkentine Kaiulani, both hailing from
San Francisco and known to have been â¢
engaged in the lumber trade on this
coast. It is evident that a mistake
has been made in reading the schoon- i
<>r's name. Under the direction of the j
Roman Catholic fathers at Kyoquot j
the Indians have been searching care
fully along the beaches north and
routh of the wreck for any trace of
members of the crew or wreckage
that would throw any light upon the
identity of the upturned schooner, but
so far without success. It is reported
here from the west coast that the last
unusually severe gale that raged there
was the hurricane of March 17, the
same in which it is supposed the miss
ing Scotch ship Lamorna met disaster.
The residents along the west coast say
that the gale was one of the worst
ever known on that coast and that
any vessel would have been endan
gered even with a good offing. Since
that day much wreckage has been
washed ashore upon the west coast, j
It was just previous to that date also
that a large fleet of lumber-laden i
schooners put to sea from Puget |
Sound and the Columbia River, and
tt is supposed that the latest Victim
of the ocean now lying upon the Kyo- j
quot reefs was one of them. Should a !
strong westerly wind spring up the \
vessel is doomed. She would go to
pieces in her present situation In a few
hours.
The Kailua was a three-masted
schooner of 653 tons net register. She
was built in 1900 at Hoquiara. Hind,
VICTORIA. B. C. April 6.â Another
derelict of the ocean has drifted in
upon the iron-bound coast of Vancouv
er Island from the Pacific and has
been found by the Indians, who are
looting the cargo, or as much of it as
they can get at. for the vessel is bot
tom up. She is a three-masted schoon
er, said to be the Kailua, lumber laden
and bound to San Francisco. Her cargo
is coming up from below m bunches
of boards and beams and is being col
lected by the Indians, who are piling
it up in stacks along the beach.
The wreck was sighted by the In
dians drifting in from the sea this
morning:, and they reported the cir
cumstance to the authorities. Only the
keel and parts of the lower body are
visible above water as she lies hard
and fast on the reef off Kyoquot Point,
not far from Clayoquot. Not a sign of
the crew has been found so far. They
may be in the forecastle and cabins
below just as the grust that probably
turned the schooner turtle struck them,
with no chance to save their lives.
Everything about the strange wreck is
conjectural until the Dominion Gov
ernment steamer Quadra shall have
completed her investigation of the hulk
and succeeded in an effort to bring the
deck uppermost again. The Quadra
was dispatched to the scene of the
wreck with instructions to take all
steps to ascertain the real name of the
vessel, her destination and other par
ticulars.
Special Dtirpatch to The Call
TUTUILA, Samoa, .March 22.â The
Uruguayan bark Ama Begonakoa ar
rived in Pago Pago harbor on March
5 from Cardiff, Wales, with a cargo of
3600 tons of coal for the naval station
at Tutulla. When in Eight of Tutulla
the Ama Begonakoa was becalmed.
She was sighted on March 3. Captain
Underwood, U. S. X., commandant of
the station, arranged to send two
s"team launches to assist in towing the
bark Into the harbor. These wer doing
good work, but toward evening a
strong wind started up from the west
and the Ama Begonakoa was in dan
ger of drifting on the rocks at the
entrance of the harbor. There being
no other 6team vessel* In port. Captain
Underwood went out with the Wheel
ing and brought the bark to port.
When in 39 degrees 25 minutes south
latitude and 18 degrees 29 minutes east
longitude the Ama Begonakoa
sighted the Norwegian bark Sappho
Hying a signal of distress. The chief
officer of the Ama Bogonakoa board
ed the Sappho and found that the ves
sel was leaking considerably and it
was impossible to keep her afloat. It
was then decided to abandon the ship
and the captain and nine of his crew
embarked on the Ama Begonakoa.
The Sappho, of 494 tons register, left
Ship Island on the Mississippi laden
with a cargo of pitch pine bound for
Natal, in South Africa, on the 23d of
July, 1903.
When in the Gulf of Mexico, heavy
seas and storms were encountered and
the vessel sprang aleak. Slow prog
ress was made in the voyage and the
vessel put into Pernambuco for pro
visions. Several days afterward the
master proceeded on his voyage and
more rough weather was experienced.
The vessel leaked so badly that the
crew by working day and night could
not keep her afloat. They were in an
exhausted condition when rescued by
the passing ship.
There being no Norwegian Consul in
Tutulla the commandant rendered aid
to the distressed seamen by paying suf
ficient money for â¢ their subsistence
and passage to Auckland. New Zeal
and, where they will get further assist
ance from the Swedish Consul there.
DES MOINES, la.. April Â«.â By re
considering the vote by which it re
fused to grant a pardon to Sarah Kuhn,
the Senate, late this evening, indicated
its intention to concur in the action of
the House, which to-day voted deci
sively in favor of pardoning Mrs.
Kuhn. Opponents of the pardon openly
declare that Mrs.' Kuhn's youth and
beauty have brought about her pardon,
two years after the conviction of the
murder of her husband and sentence to
lrfe imprisonment. She is not yet twen
ty and is conceded to possess rare
beauty, which Is supplemented by an
air of childlike innocence.
Mrs. Kuhn's alleged victim was an
old man, nearly three times her age,
homely and a hopeless cripple. Her
marriage was a subject of barter be
tween Kuhn and her lover, Charles
Smith, by whom it has. developed she
had been seduced. Smith volunteered
to act as Kuhn's John Alderi and ob
tained Sarah's consent to marry him.
Four months of married life developed
the utter hopelessness of Kuhn winning
her love and she advised him that she
would return to her parents. Thus far
the statement of facts is alike by both
sides.
Friends of M,rs. Kuhn claim that her
husband determined to take his own
life and hers also and placed poison in
the beer that caused his death. He
urged her to drink from the same bot
tle, but she detected a peculiar taste
and declined, thereby saving her life.
There Is no evidence contradicting this,
but there is a theory against it to the
effect that Mrs. Kuhn determined to
get rid of her husband, obtain his for
tune and marry Smith, who, she had
learned, was about to marry another.
According to this theory Mrs. Kuhn
deliberately poisoned her husband. As
he died he was overheard to accuse
her of having poisoned him. The Su
preme Court affirmed her sentence, but
Justice Weaver, in a dissenting opinion,
declared it to be" an outrage due to
public sentiment and based on theory,
not evidence. The Legislature has
adopted the same views.

the feature was the fieldlng~of Mohler

The match race at 100 yards be
tween Francis Galey. the crack Aus
tralian swimmer, and Otto Schultz of
the Lurline Club was a one-sided one.
Galey took the lead at the start and
won all the way, making the distance
in 1:02. just two-fifths of a second
outside the American amateur record.
The swimming tournament at the
Olympic Club last night brought out
a large attendance of spectators and
the close and exciting events were
greatly enjoyed by those present. The
event of the night, the relay race for
the John J. Gleason challenge cup,
was won by the Olympic Club team,
made up of Galey. Leary, Sunberg and
Bonnifleld. Galey, the Australian,
took the lead in the first relay and
the "winged O" men led their oppo
,nents, the Lurline swimmers, all the
way. Arthur Young, for the Lurlines,
made a great effort to regain the lost
ground, but the handicap was too
great and the Olympians easily fin
ished ahead in the fast time of 3:40.
The husky youths who are wont to
wield' their fists for a livelihood under
the guise of amateurism have organ
ized a union. 'Tis a real union and
a strong one at thatâ so strong that
when the Bay City Athletic Club tried
to promote its show at Mechanics' Pa
vilion Annex last ni^ht, the 'scrappers
got together and demanded a larger
fee than was promised them. "When
the fight magnates refused, the glove
artists gathered in warlike session and
consequently the show never went
through.
The place was thronged with a crowd
of. sports anxious to witness a few
hot mixups. Some of the lesser lights
of the ring who were In need of a
little soft coin voluteered to go some
rounds to entertain the crowd and
agreed to accept non-union fees. Mr.
"Rough House" McDonald, walking
delegate of the union, took one of
them aside and said in part:
"Now- you listen to me, kid, . fer I
have been elected by de squeeze as de
main wolloper of non-union scrappers
an' go-between man wid de promoters.
Rule 36 of de by-laws says dat if yer
fights without a union card you will
have to meet de gang after de s.how
and de gang will proceed to trow de
wollop to yer. Now if you take my
tip you will dodge two beatings, for
If you get into de ring wid dat guy he
will beat you nearly to death and den
we will complete de job out In de alley.
So get jerry and fade away."
The youth partook of this fatherly
advice and faded away. Before he
faded he told the rest of the boxers
who 'were carded to take the. places of
the fighters out on strike. "When the
promoters began to search for talent
they discovered there was nobody
available except a few policemen. A3
they were' not in condition, the show
was called off and the crowd received
its money back.
The prizefighters' union was formed
a short time ago. The men of the
gloves discovered that the promoters
were *making a big bunch of" coin out
of the sweat of the boxers* brows.
Under the rules of theirv H,e\v_ associa
tion, no manager . was ' to- -"pay more
than J30 f<Jr a fight.. The boys then
demanded $75 and $50 for maip events
and whatever they could- get-f or the
lesser events. They say these rates
will prevail from now on and if the
magnates will not come through with
the additional money, the game will be
given a well deserved rest.
The ambitions of these "amateur"
boxers, who are apparently profession
al financiers, have been fired by recent
reports of the profit in the game. One
club had a $6000 house while another
had a $3300 Â¦ house. The manager of
one "amateur" received about $1300 as
his share of the gate money. The
boxer is . showing only, a cheap watch
as his â¢ rewaVa for his expertnesa with
the gloves. What he is not showing
is another story.
Then Sc hmidt walked Beck, while
Castro lined one safe to the outfield.
The bagrs were all crowded and it
!.>Â«)ked like a hundred runs for the
stars of the north, Mr. Freeman was
â¢thoughtless enough to hit one to
Francks, who returned the sphere to
Streib in a jiffy, completing a double
play and ending the run-getting streak
of the Portlanders for the balance of
the game. : - â¢
Oakland did not create any runs till
iht- third. Then Mr. Lehman partook
<>f a free passage to first. Schmidt sac
rificed cleverly and Ganley lined it out
to right field. Francks, by accident,
hit one on the line. Mr. McCreedis
tried to be acrobatic ar.a after rolling
over himself eleven times the ball got
â¢lisgusted and left him. Peter came in
on this and Francks went to second.
Along in the sixth Krugvr cracked
out a hot two-bagger to the score
board. He was only on the bag for
a. minute when Jule Streib responded
w ith one of the same brand, bringing
in the last run of the day. After the
fir-Et inning the Portlanders were com
pletely baffled by Schmidt and could
not approach the rubber. Shields was
j<lso in good form and struck out seven
men, but at this he could not win.

CALLAXT A WINNER
The entry of â¢ Veterano was ordered
refused in future at Oakland' track by
the judges, for ; inconsistent running.
Some other, entries were also passed
out by the : officials. The third race
had a decided off color look and - for
his inanimate handling of Hirtle, the
favorite, Buxton was placed on the
suspended list.: . Henry Spencer, who
rode Brennus in 'the same event, was
requested to accept no ': more mounts
at Oakland. In'the^closing number "on
the card, it was the opinion, of the: of-:
licials' that .Bozeman. who], piloted
Axmlnster," deliberately interfered* with'
Stewart, on Caronal, the favorite, and
the former rider was ordered sus
pended.

It pays to be a. good talker at times.
J. Jones, who rode Veterano, is blessed
with a good gift of the "gab," while
Iva Powell, who rode . Horatius, is an
exceedingly reticent young man. .
Harry Stover's crack colt George P.
McXear was nearly put out of commis
sion in the two-year-old dash, over
four and a half furlongs. The big
son* of Torso went to the post a 3 to 5
chance and on the far turn, as See
cut in to the rail position with the fa
vorite. Salable Jumped on him and
came within a fraction of an inch of
severing the big fellow's near ham
string. Toward the close McNear
slackened up his speed perceptibly and
Salable only lost the verdict by a
scant head. Eduardo, now racing in
the colors of D. J. \Blakeman, and
trained by Harry Robinson, finished a
moderate third.
From . Marconigrams that were
flashed previous to the third, a
Futurity course sprint, a pyrotechnical
display was all arranged, .with Salto
as the center piece. Twelve men,
working an eight-hour shift, couldn't
count the money in thirty days that
went into the books on Dell Fountain's
gelding. He closed second choice to
HIrtle, but was sore coming from the
paddock and ran forth.' Tom Ryan's
Clausus. which receded Â¦ from 10 to 20
and 25 to 1, soon'showed in front after
the start, winning as he pleased from
Emil, a 60 to 1 shot. Resigned, played
down to 8 to 1, finished in the show.
Buxton, on . Hirtle, a mare lightning
fast awav from the barrier, managed
to get mixed up in the bunch and went
on a sight-seeing; tour through Golden
Gate. Brennus displayed some -speed
with his 128 pounds, fading away as
the wire hove in sight. ' . , : -
Jack Crane's Byronerdale, second
choice .in the betting, captured the
coucluding number, a mile . selling ., af
fair. The gelding ruled second choice
in the ring and with "Big Bill" Knapp
up, ' sailed out in front" and ' stayed
there. Caronal, the favorite, was'al
most put , over the fence at the first
turn by Bozeman on Axmlnster and
then lost by less than a length. With
out interference he could scarcely have
lost. ' The show fell to Oro Viva, -"
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
STOVER'S COLT INJURED.
1 Honiton, the crack daughter of Or
monde, simply made a show of 'her
field in the fifth race of the day, a
six furlong purse event. Her odds fell
by degrees from 7 to 10 to 2 to 5, and
with Bonner in the saddle she led fron.
start to finish, winning ip a gallop in
1:13 flat. Mansard grew weary chasing
her, losing the place to Ocean Dream
by a neck. The other starters were
hopelessly outclassed.
Mountain won the opening event on
Educate, a 10 to 1 shot. The mare dkl
not lack speed and at the finish it
looked as if Mountain outfinished
Frank Otis on the mild favorite Our
Pride. "Willie See rode a vigorous race
on Cherries, taking the show at odds
of SO to 1. Box 'Elder ran fourth and
might have be'en closer up with a
stronger ride. Vonzollern had early
speed, but could not last the route.-v .
It was purely unintentional on the
part of Powell, who quickly straight
ened out the favorite and beat Veterano
a neck, Grafter 'being half a length
farther away. Jones claimed a foul and
after considerable deliberation it was
allowed by the Judges, Veterano being
placed first. Grafter second and the
favorite third.
Favorites again played in ill luck,
taking but two purses. Educate, Clau
sus and the handicap winner furnished
the big surprises.
The Judges at Oakland racetrack ren
dered a decision disqualifying: Horatius,
winner of the mile and a furlong hand
icap at Oakland yesterday, that may
have been Just and is in accordance
with the rules of racing, but it -was far
from being a popular one. .
Veterano, to which the race was
awarded, had J. Jones in the saddle,
and at one stage of the betting was
30 to 1. His was a surprising reversal
of form, for on March 30 in a handi
cap won by Ben MacDhui he finished
last, after failing to show a spark or
a flicker of speed. >
Horatius, ridden by Powell, carried
top weight. 111: pounds, and was backed
down from 11 to 5 to 3 to z favoritism.
Gateway and Grafter cut out the run
ning necks apart for nearly a mile,
when the former began 'to droop, and
Jones closed on Grafter with Veterano,
the 97-pounder, the issue looking to be
between the pair. Horatius," though, is
something of a stretch runner himself
and seventy yards, from the wire he
nabbed the leaders, at the same time
swerving in some and slightly bump
ing Veterano, which horse in turn
bumped Grafter.

Henry Carr, pawnbroker, 516 Dupont
street, was arrested yesterday . and
booked at the City Prison by Detectives
â¢ Ryan and Taylor on charge's of receiv
ing stolen property and falling to make
an entry in his books at the time -of
purchase as required bylaw. The war
rants were sworn to before Police
Judye Fritz.
' Carr's arrest is a result -of a con
fession made by Morris Church that
he had entered Into an agreement with
Carr to the effect that Carr would pur
chase from him any articles, although
knowing them # to \ have been stolen.
Church, in Carr's presence yesterday
morning, repeated his charge against
Carr and said that It was understood
between them that when any suspicious
person was in the store when Church
called Carr was to shake his head. The
first time he sold anything to Carr
was on January 10, the article being
a revolver that Church had stolen "in
Oakland.
Church was also booked on a charge
of grand larceny and four charges of
petty larceny. He is the man who has
been telephoning to business houses to
send articles to another business house
and when the messenger appeared with
the articles Church would take the
package from him and .tell him it was
all right. â¢ Then Church would take the
articles, so he alleges, to Carr and
sell them.
In the United States District Court
yesterday morning William F. Dasha
followed the example set on the pre
ceding day by Thomas J. Dempsey and
pleaded guilty of having conspired
I with Thomas T. Burnett, T. J. Demp
sey and Wong Din to land Chinese il
legally in the United States. The
trial of Wong Din was then proceeded
\rifh and the jury after nineteen min
j utes* absence from the courtroom
I brought in a verdict of guilty as
charged. Wong %was ordered to ap
| pear for sentence on Saturday.
As soon as the gap made in the jury
Â¦ on the preceding day by the with
i drawal of Juror Rudolph Mohr had
I been filled from the panel J. C. West
! moved for a dismissal of the indlct
j ment against Wong- Din on the ground
i that. he had been once in jeopardy be-
I fore the jury of the preceding day and
j by the discharge of Juror Mohr after
; the jurors had been sworn to try the
! case. United States District Attorney
! Woodworth called the attention of the
I court to the fact that Mohr had been
| discharged on Mrr West's motion.
I Judge de Haven, addressing Mr. West,
remarked sternly: "You cannot take
i advantage of what was done on your
! own motion. This is trifling with the
j court and I don't propose to have any
thing of that sort here."
Thomas T. Burnett told the story
, of the conspiracy hatched in the Coun
! ty Jail, of which Dasha, Dempsey,
j Wong Din, Deputy United States Mar
shal William P. Gamble and himself
were members. Three or four days
prior to August 7, 1903, Wong Din
asked Burnett to substitute five Chi
nese for five prisoners then in jail
I awaiting deportation, the price agreed
j upon being $1000, or $200 for each
; person substituted. Between 9 and 10
I p. m. of August 7 Wong Din brought
| five Chinese substitutes to the jail and
I took away the five prisoners. On that
| occasion he made a part payment of
i $600 - to Burnett, who divided the
j money among his confederates. On
I the following morning Deputy Marshal
Gamble took the five substitutes from
I the jail to the steamer which was to
; eall for China on that day.
United States Marshal Shine related
! that he arrested Wong Din in China- |
town of September, 1903, and took j
him handcuffed to room 61 in the
Russ House, where the prisoner made
a confession and talked so fast that t
the officials could not keep up vritti j
him.
Judge de Haven ruled that any evi
dence as to the confession was not
admissible, Wong Din being under
duress at the time.
The prisoner then went on the stand j
and flatly denied having been a party j
to the conspiracy or of having paid j
anybody any money.
The third indictment, charging J
Dasha, Dempsey, Burnett and Lee Lim ;
with conspiracy. wJW be taken up this j
morning, but will probably be post
poned on account of the absence from
the city of Samuel M. Shortridge, at

A warrant is out for the arrest -of
one Richard Doe, who aided and abet
ted Mr. Devin's efforts - to transform
the theater into a rough house. V ,
It was testified that there was no
genuine provocation for the defend
ant's disorderly behavior, as all whose
Â¦work elicited, his disapproval were
ladles and gentlemen \ of/ long experi
ence and creditable standing in the
profession, and that they neither said
nor did anything that could bring rea
sonable protest from the most fastid
ious . stickier for stage propriety. In
other words, Mr. Devin's conduct was
simply an ebullition of instinctive and
uncontrollable hoodlumism, and after
pronouncing It such Judge Mogan or
dered him to appear to-day for sen
tence.
' Emil Devin disturbed the peace of a
Broadway vaudeville by jeer
ing at the performers whose "turns",
did not please him and then assault-
Ing the special policeman who first ex
postulated and then ejected him.
The complaining witness was J. E.
Allison, president of. the aforemen
tioned corporation, and he accused the
defendant of having willfully misap
propriated about $350 of the funds en
trusted to him as manager. The de
fense was an acknowledgment that
the money had been received as
charged, but that it had been dis
bursed among other corporations with
which the Farmers* and Manufactur
ers' Association was financially affili
ated. The plea was thoroughly sub
stantiated by evidence.
Judge Cabanlss dismissed a charge of
felony embezzlement against Charles
E. Clark, . assistant manager of the
Farmers' and Manufacturers' Associa
tion of America, and supplemented the
order of dismissal with a voluntary
opinion that Mr. Clark's conduct in the
premises had been absolutely blame
less.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"monkey" with the law's well regulated
machinery can be testified to by
K. I>alis and corroborated by one Gus
Cotherintien. It was either a pitiful
misconception of the duties and re
sponsibilities attached to the office of
policeman, or an indiscreet desire to
relieve one of those functionaries of
his prescribed work, that led Mr. Dalis
to take into his own hands the task
of effecting the arrest of a man who
had assaulted him, and it was the error
thus committed by Mr. Dalis that led
to the wrongful placing of Mr.. Cothe
rintien In the position of a defendant
before Judge Conlan.
Mr. Dalis, who resides at 777 Folsom
street, swore to a warrant accusing one
Gus Macres of battery, and without
fretting the document signed by a mag
istrate or enlisting police aid in any
way he went forth to arrest his al
leged assailant. He must have been
somewhat in doubt as to the identity
of the man he desired to punish, for
it was Gus Cotherintien instead of Gus
Macres that he dragged into court. It
took Judge Conlaii just about three
minutes and a quarter to ascertain that
Mr. Dalis had committed a serious
blunder and to order the case stricken
from the calendar.
"The next time you want to have
any one arrested." said the Judge to
Mr. Dalis. "you would better let the
police act for you. They are better
acquainted with the circumlocutory
preliminaries of warrant-serving than
any amateur can possibly be. Tour
zeal â some people might term it stu
pidity â has put this Mr. Cotherintien
to a great deal of inconvenience,
though if he had exercised a little or
dinary intelligence he might ' have
averted It by discovering your mis
take. How you managed to get him
this far' toward trial without encoun
tering a snag is one thing that puzzles
me and leads to the inference that
there is a defect In our time-honored
routine."
Mr. Cotherintien did not seem to un
derstand why he was released any
more than he understood why he had
been arrested. M^^
That it is unsafe for a layman to
As they sat in court the defendants
were closely veiled, until the Judge or
dered them to remove the face cover
ings. Then he pronounced them guilty
as charged, and expressed regret that
strict adherence to the letter of the
law prevented him from punishing
them for attempted highway robbery.
They will be sentenced to-day.
Accompanied by the complainant, the
officer began a search of the neighbor
hood and was soon rewarded by find
ing Annie and Mary Ellen seated in
a Mission-street restaurant- They were
partaking, of the best the larder af
forded and chatting and laughing as
they ate, when the policeman claimed
them as his own. To this the restaura
teur fijed protest, on the ground that
he had received no payment for the
viands which had been ordered by
Mary Ellen. She pleaded inability to
pay, and the caterer was insisting en
holding her as security for the debt,
when a perplexing situation was clari
fied by the officer's suggesting that an
additional charge of defrauding an inn
keeper be entered against the debtor.
This was done.
Mrs. Minnie Irwin of 2229 Weolsey
street, Berkeley, was .the complaining
witness. While walking along Mission
street, between Third and Fourth, last
Tuesday afternoon she was stopped by
Annie Meehan and requested to '"hand
out some money." Surprised and a little
startled at the woman's manner, Mrs.
Irwin endeavored to resume her walk,
but was restrained by Annie, who
roughly repeated that she wanted
money, and wanted it "right away."
Then, becoming thoroughly frightened,
Mrs. Irwin attempted to run past An
nie, and had almost succeeded in doing
so, when Mary Ellen grabbed Irer and
with an epithet hurled her against the
wall. The lady managed to continue
her flight, however, and ran until she
met Patrolman Moriarity, to whom she
recounted her experience.
Judge Mogan sarcastically congratu
lated Annie Meehan and Mary Ellen
] Farrier, middle aged and shabby gen
teel, upon the fact that they were not
accused of footpedism instead of beg
ging, and hinted that the. evidence
pretty clearly proved them guilty of
the former offense.
Barney Hoffman and Isaac Magedin
were given six months apiece, by Judge
Fritz. Originally charged with grand
larceny, they pleaded guilty to petty
pilfering. "~ *
Sarah Martin, accused of stealing $180
from Steven Sadowa in a Kearny
street lodging-house, has been sent to
the Superior Court by Judge Mogan,
with ball fixed at $2000.
Police Officer Connolly testified that
Ah Sin could not be literally accused
of selling lottery â¢ tickets because the
tickets he sold to unsophisticated Cau
casians in the wholesale district were
not issued by a lottery, but were man
ufactured by Ah Sin himself. But that
was not the entire. limit of Ah Sin's
fraudulent enterprise. After he . had
sold the tickets he woula visit his vic
tims the next day and show them whai
he professed to have been the result of
the formal drawing the previous even
ing, and each of them would thus be
convinced that he had just missed by
one dot the winning of a valuable prize,
so of course he would try again, paying
Ah Sin 25 cents for the privilege.
Ah Sin was remanded by Judge Mo
gan till to-day, when he will probably
put up some sort of a defense.
Edward Mitchell, alias Charles Mitch
ell, alias Ernest Carron, was first con
victed of grand larceny September 5.
1S90, but escaped through a legal loop
hole. On October 30 of the same year
he was found guilty of robbery and
sentenced. March 30, 1891, he was given
ninety days for vagrancy. June 13,
1S92, he was convicted of robbery, and
three days later additional charges of
burglary and assault to murder were
proved against him. July 29, 1902, he
was sentenced to seventeen years at
San Quentin. A few days ago he was
released.
After the disclosure of the defend
ant's identity the prosecution closed its
case and the criminal of deceptive en
semble will offer his defense to-day.
-When an honest-faced, genteel-look
ing man stood accused of robbery the
other day in Judge Mogan's court the
general impression of the uninitiated m
the ways of crime and criminals was
that a mistake had been made despite
damaging evidence of hia guilt. The
complaining witness was a soldier
np.med Searl, who testified that the de
fendant had snatched his watch and
chain and ran, closely pursued by the
complainant, until his flight was
stopped by Police Corporal Egan. The
watch and chain were" not in* the "pris
oner's possession and- that fact prob
ably enhanced the impression of in
nocence created by his open counte
nance and respectable apparel. He
said his name was Ernest Carron, em
phatically declared he was guiltless of
crime and asseverated that never be
fcre had he been subjected to the in
dignity of arrest. Then, at the request
of the police, he was remanded for
further inquiry as to his past The
investigation was concluded yesterday
and reported in court and the Judge
fairly gasped as he heard the man's
record unfolded. -
Johnson was arrested on complaint
of his young wife, whoXtold a story
of the man's depraved cruelty that
brought upon him the Â¦ most scathing
contumely ever delivered from the
bench of Mo?an â and that is saying
more than a little for the vigor of the
denunciatory address.
Michael Johnson's attorney did not
help his client's case to any palpable
extent by objecting to almost every
word of interrogation uttered by Judge
Mogan, for â¢ the defendant was pro
nounced guilty of carrying concealed
weapons and then sentenced to the
maximum penaltyâ six months in the
County 'Jailâ for that offense. Then the
Judge hinted that to-day he will place
Johnson under a $5000 bond to keep the
peace. In default of furnishing good
and sufficient sureties for that amount
the unhappy Johnson is likely to spend
six months additional in durance. A
charge of threatening to kill will also
be heard to-day.
Unless the Sheriff or one of his dep
uties formally charges Stark with jail
breaking be is likely to elude punish
ment for that offense. It was for send
ing dire threats to members of the;
opulent Huntington family that he was
arrested in Los Angeles, and the au
thorities of that city evidently em
braced with avidity the chance to send
him back to San Francisco.
After repeated requests to aprjsar in
court and sign a complaint charging
Stark with escaping from thÂ£ County
Jail, the former superintendent of that
institution, A. J, Martin, yesterday
responded in person, but politely de
clined to do as advised; \Â£hen asked
for a reason he; said that he is no
longer in public office and does not
want to adulterate his private busi
ness with public affairs of any kind.
The court remonstrated, but -the .-ex
jailer turned a deaf ear -to reminders
of the duties of citizenship, etc., and
firmly stalked out. of court.
who escaped from the: County Jail ere
he Journeyed -to the. southland, has
become a familiar figure in Jud?e Mo-'
san's court. It is the evident desire of
that tribunal to punish Stark for his
jail-break, because it was a misde
meanor and also because he is a no
toriously bad character, but at every
hearing a new obstacle rises to inter
fere with the programme- v

LIGHT. AND IS AS CONSPICUOUS FOR
ITS WONDERFUL OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR ITS ORIGINAL EXPRESSION
AND VIVID TRUTHFULNESS.

little value when the rnlnd is troubled â you
need mere substantial aid and advice. This Is
Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives you
when you call on him for a first-class clair-
voyant reading. He asks you no questions,
hut tells you what you wish to know..
He dees not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with tho facts In your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling ycu. find the cause of .trouble and
suggest the remedy.

â¢till in the hands c.f professional operatcrs. and
the early- activity was not well maintained.
i The Utter .part of the day showed siens of

I held on the showing played an important part
I In the whole market. The wide openlftK in

The Potato market was active and in excel
lent condition for sellers.. Fr*sh arrivals of
table varieties were quickly, snapped up and
the best stock readily Commanded higher prices
ThÂ«re was very little left in first hands at the
close. New Pntaux-s were inclined to easiness,
but as receipts w&re moderate prices ware main
tained. The season for Sweet Potatoes is
closed, the last lot having been sold yesterday
at 4c per pound. The steamer Ventura brought
up C522 crates and 230 sacks of Onions from
Australia and New ZcalaatJ. The in voice had
not been unloaded ur> to a late hour. Receipts
from other sources were llsht and the market
ruled steady at previous- prices. - . -
Receipts of vegetables included 8?1 boxes
of Asparagus, 340 boxes of Rhubarb and 355
sacks of Peas. Asparagus was easier owing to
the lack of demand for shipment and after
some 'arty firmness prices of extra and No. 1
stock dechced. The market, however, was well
Cleaned up at the close. Rhubarb dragged and
most dealers were ottering to sell at cost. The
Growers' Association reduced prices at shipping
points to 50c and 75e per box for standard and
chrdce resi-ectively. Receipts of Peas consisted
chiefly of .poor stock and prices had a wid?r
range. Los Anseles Tomatoes arrived , freely,
but receipts of other vegetables from the same
si-ction were very lljrht. The Panama steamer
brought up 721 boxes of Tomatoes and :jÂ« boxes
of Peppers from Mexico. Mushrooms were of
fering in small quantities and sales were re
ported at *tu&30c l>er pound.

Wall Street Xotes.
) There is "no further change in Bran and
other Feedstuffs. jj The circular of Somers A
Co. says of" Hay:
"Contrary to general expectations receipts of
Hay have be*n ranging quite heavy for the
week ending to-day, the total being 2S0O tons,
or over 450 tons per day. It was thought that
with the filling of the Government order last
week quite a diminution In arrivals would
be noted, but the contrary has been the case.
The increase nas been occasioned by shipment
from 'outside' districts which generally do not
figure to any extent with our market, but
which are I now anxious to dispose of what
little'Hay they have remaining at the present
comparatively good prices with the expectation
of an abundant crop in Junt. Most ranchers
are able to scrape together a carload or two.
which in the aggregate amounts to a consid
erable quantity. An account of stock in our
regular Hay districts, which has been com
piled, shows but a little-over 20.000 tons of
Hay to IhbI us through. The San Francisco
market alone will probably need this entire
quantity before the first of June- If the Gov
ernment makes a purchase here and if Oakland
will draw quite an amount there Is very apt to
be a shortage next month unless quite a lot of
Hay Is dur up In districts outside of our reg
ular territory. At the present writing, how
ever, ihe situation is rather uninteresting, re
ceipts being a bit heavier than the demand, re
quires. Prices si>ow no change, however, for
the situation *s generally understood and there
is very little effort being made to bear the
market.
"All grades of Hay can be found on ib%
market almost any day. with choice grade oat"
alone being in rather light -supply."

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, April 6.â Ca*h whiat was so
scarce to-day that sales of No. 1 Northern
were made here at "*4 of a cent over the May
price, a premium higher than any hitherto
paid this season. The result was a revival of
activity- In speculative markets." July, closed
%c higher than Monday. Weakness in foreign
grain markets and favorable weather through
out the United" States caused liberal profit-tak
ing in wheat early in the day. The majority
of reoorts from the Southwest noted an im
provement in crop prospects, now that rain
and milder temperature have had time to show
ihelr effect. Advices from the Northwest also
reported prospects good for early seeding. Sfn
tlmÂ»nt consequently was quite bearish and
selling ' orders in large numbers came' out at
the start. â¢ Inlttel quotations for July were
dewn^ic to 1 cent at â¢Â£3*Â»c to SoÂ»ic. Dur
ing the first hour no support was forthcoming,
and rÂ»rlc*s declined still further. -July selling
off to S5*ic. At this, lower point-' there was
much covering by the shorts. \Afany of the'ear
lier sellers turned buyers. . As the session ad
vanced the market became stronger, the de
mand being more general In character. There
was good buying, by the Northwest under the
influence of better demand for flour at,MlnnÂ«
apolis. Rfports of fair export business at the
seaboard were received." The market closed
strong at the toe.- final flsrures on July being
at iS6Tic. May sold between t)2%c and 01TÂ«c
and closed at IM^c.
Und*r the impression that the principal long
was disposing of his line, pit ; traders In corn
and small holders sold freely early in the
day, causing an extremely weak market. July
closed at 7>2%c.
Oats "followed the course of wheat and corn,
being weak car!y on free selltn* and rallying
later on literal covering by shorts. July closed
at 3Si;,c.
Provisions were weak on persistent selling by
cor:mltolon houses, in the face of only a mod
erate demand. The eÂ£rly weakness in grains
and a decline of 101Â»15c In the price of hog*
were the n-ain bear factors. ., Th* market closed
with oork 17>4â¬?*-Oc lower. July lard closed
7H* lower and ribs were off 7^c.

Herrera developed a fondness for
strong-drink and for some time prior
to his death was in more or less of a
maudlin condition. He fell madly In
love with a lady passenger. His over
tures were repelled and one still night,
when all on.;, board were asleep but
the watch and, when the watch was
not looking, Herrera crept to the door
of the stateroom where slept the lady
who had scorned his love and drank
the contents of a bottle of chloroform.
His dead body was found there some
time later. '~~il>^
It is understood that Herrera's rela
tives had straightened out, the legal
tangle In which his^ skillful penman
ship had involved Edouardo and that
a prodigal's welcome awaited the
forger at Valparaiso. :
Herrera was a young man of good
family and had occupied a position of
trust In the service of the Chilean
Government. He forged some official
documents and with the money so ob
tained fled, from: Valparaiso. He was
arrested here by- the manager of a
private detective agency and held in
the City., Prison until arrangements
were made for his extradition.
In custody of C. H. Norris of the
Curtin Detective Agency Herrera
sailed from here February 13 on the
City of Para. *He had threatened to
make away .with himself and Norris
was supplied with appliances to re
strain his prisoner should the neces
sity arise. ' Ringbolts were screwed
Into the stateroom floor and every pre
caution ' was taken to Insure the
prisoner's safe, delivery at Valparaiso.
After the steamer got to sea Her
rera Beemed to have abandoned all
Idea of self-destruction and his cus
todian allowed, him to mingle with the
other passengers and enjoy himself as
he saw fit. . v
Edouardo M. Herrera, the Chilean
forger, -who left here last February on
the City of. Para under arrest on an
extradition warrant, and raws of
whose death was received some time
later, died on the City of Para by his
own hand. Particulars ,of his death
were learned on the. arrival of the
steamer yesterday from; Panama. * * '
Attorney William Maguire was con
sulted by the two victims -and he as
certained that Smith had lived at 122t
Golden Gate avenue. One of the room
ers there told Maguire that he had oc
casion to look at Smith's hat once and
saw the letters "S. A. M." on the
band. He spoke to Smith about it and
Smith said that he and a friend .had
purchased hats at the same time In
Chicago and" had taken the wrong
hats. It is believed these a,re the in
itials of the name Smith was known
by in Chicago.
Shreve & Co., the jewelers, are also
out $202*50. On jthe day of his depar
ture Smith ordered that amount of
jewelry and when the clerk called with
the parcel Smith displayed a bagful of
gold and told him he intended calling
at Shreve*8 and putting it in the safe
there, as he was going to Los Angeles
on a trip and would not be back for. a
few days. The firm, Smith said, could
take out what was due them. This
satisfied the clerk and he. left the
package. . but Smith did not turn up.
The case has been put in the hands
of Detective Whltaker, who thinks
other firms have been victimized.'
Descriptions of Smith will . be sent
throughout the country, asking for his
arrest.
Another victim of Smith is Alexan
der Westrun of Kenwood. Sonoma
County. He also answered the adver
tisement for a partner and on March
24 paid Smith S1500 cash and gave him
a note for $1500 more. He was told by
Smith that a customer In Pasadena
wanted to buy an automobile, but as
there was not one in stock that would
be suitable, he would have to go to
Salt Lake City, where Smith said he
had a machine of his own. Westrup
was to get the machine and bring it
to the city. He got a. letter of'intro
duction to the man in Salt Lake who,
Smith said, had the machine, but when
he got there, no such man was known.
Westrup also paid his own transporta
tion. When he returned to this city
Smith had disappeared.
i VICTIMIZES SIIREVF/S.
Eckland was sent to Chicago to ob
tain money to release tht; machines
from bond and was furnished with a
letter of introduction to an alleged
friend of Smith in that city. who. it
was claimed, would provide the money
and also pay for Eckland's transpor
tation back, Eckland having paid his
own fare to Chicago. Eckland called
at the address given in Chicago, but
no such person was known there.
Eckland made inquiry and ascertained
that nothing was known at the Cus
tom house of the existence of the
eight carloads of machines. He then
consulted a private detective agency,
and was told that he had run up
against one of the cleverest crooks in
the country. When he returned to
this city he discovered that Smith
had flown.
