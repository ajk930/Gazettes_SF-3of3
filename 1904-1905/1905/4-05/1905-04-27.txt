Steals Uncompiited Thousands Jor Women, Races and Stocks
Tax Collector Edward J. Smith has absconded with over $^4,000 of the city's money. More shortages may be uncovered. A
year ago he was short 18165,000, but the shortage was made good by his brother. Smith was known to have spent large sums

About a year ago Smith was short in
his accounts $165,000. When the short
age was about to be made public the
Tax Collector went to his brother.
James B. Smith, the Grand Juryman,
and a man of integrity, with a piteous
appeal. He begged hi brother to pull
him out of the hole. For the sake of the
family and in a spirit of brotherly
love that is rare. James B. Smith faced
bankruptcy to save him. The shortaee
was never made public
The Tax Collector promised to redeem
himself and the brother took him at
his word. To make sure, as he thought,
that the man would not rob the city
again. James B. Smith had another
".brother, John, put into the Tax Office
to see that Edward J. Smith did not
again disgrace the family.
But the woman that clung to Edward
J. Smith like a vampire wanted more
money. Smith tried to get it for her by
manipulating the taxes of the Sharon
estate. He was caught by James He-
Cabe. the man who has been appoint
ed to 'succeed him. Somehow he man
aged to secure $30,000 to make good.
GAMBLED IN STOCKS.
In an effort to get back the nloney
lie had spent on the woman and inci
dentally to lavish more upon her,
Smith took to gambling in stocks and
on the races. He managed somehow
to conceal these operations and out-
Bide of three or four people no one
knew that he was speculating. He
.placed his bets through commission
ers and no one ever saw him in a
broker's office. â¢*"
The woman left town on April 9.
It is believed that she and Smith had
arranged to meet in some foreign
â  country. Women who know Tier say
that before she left Smith gave her
$25,000.
Smith left town Thursday. He told
his unfortunate wife that he was going
to Los Angeles on business and gave
the same tale to his friend* The po
lice believe that by this time he is
well on the â ay to Mexico or South
America.
The woman had been living at the
Luxor under an assumed name. She
attended the opera clad in costly rai
ment that had been bought with money
etolen by Smith. She left the place in
an automobile, surrounded by trunks
and band-boxes containing apparel
worth over $20,000.
Smith's wife is broken-hearted over
the Oisgrace. The generous brother
says little, but his grief is keen.
Men that knew Edward J. Smith
around the City Hal! now brand him
as unspeakable for the way he treated
his brother. James* generosity' kept
the news of the former defalcation
quiet and the announcement came
liko a thunderclap out of a clear sky.

F. H. Gilbert, manager of the Na

stated last l'.ifri^t that he had no idea
what the exact amount of Smith's
shortage would be.

some $39,00i< â¢ â¢

Swindler's Previous
Shortages Come
to Light.
Information was brought to Mayor
Schmitz yesterday that Tax Collector
Edward J. Smith had absconded, leav
ing a known shortage in his arcounts
of $39,113 28. The actual amount of
Smith's defalcation will not be known,
however, until the experts who have
been put to work on the tax records
file their report, but the deficit appears
to be growing and will probably be
far in excess of the sum named. It is
said the money was spent on women,
betting on race horses and in specula
tion in stocks.
Smith has fled from the city, not
having been seen since last Thursday
afternodn, when he left his office,'
ostensibly to take a trip to L<os Ange
les.
The discovery that Smith had stolen
money from the city also brought to
light the fact that in April, 1904, he
was short $165,000 in his accounts,
which was made good by his brother,
James B. Smith, vice president of the
"Western Fuel Company and member
of the Grand Jury, who pledged
$250,000 worth of his personal securi
ties to raise the money to save the
family from dishonor. The shortage
was hushed up at the time, although
rumors on the subject were rife.
On learning the facts the Mayor sus
pended Smith from office and ap r
pointed James W. McCabe, a civil ser
vice deputy in the Tax Office. Tax
Collector, pending an investigation to
be held by the Board of Supervisors,
which has been called in session by
the Mayor for this afternoon at 2
o'clock.
The news that ' Tax Collector Smith
is a defaulter was brought to the
Mayor by the Collector's brother, John
R. Smith, who has been handling the
funds of the Tax Office ever since the
$165,000 defalcation of last year.
GKTS CHECKS FOR TAXES.
John Smith informed the Mayor
that his brother had on April 4 re
ceived two checks, one for $17,683 76
and one for $6694 56, from E. Black

or beside Mrs. Joe Harvey. She al- â 
ways came in late, anj as she entered
the theater she attracted attention by ;
her magnificent gowns.

In fact, a large portion of the Sunday '

When Smith first met hei, it is report
ed.- she was in very hard straits. Her
jewels were -all in pawn. Her first re
quest was that Jmith should get the
Jewels. out. and this he did.
. The next thing he did was to estab
lish her in the Luxurious meats. It
is said her gc-wns and furs were un
<=-qÂ«arÂ«*d by any in San Francisco. Her
set* <-f ermine is said to have been the
finest that has ever been displayed in
the city. She also wore occasionally a
* magnilicent set of mink furs. These
'were especially the envy of the women
who happened to Bee them.
While her stage pretensions were not
great, Â«=he still had aspirations. About
eight' years ago she appeared at the Or
pheum, doing a turn with Don Cann.
The latter had a fine voice, and while
Lillian Leslie was only a singer in a
small way, her magnificent beauty, her
gorgeous costumes and her stage pres
ence helped carry out ,her part in the
team.
About this time Truly Shattuck ap
peared on the scene and was a great
friend or the fair Lillian. It is report
ed that Lillian and Truly contemplated
a starring trip to Europe, Just before
the proposed trip was carried out, a
millionaire appeared on the scene and
Miss Leslie abandoned the scheme.
0011 TO RESCUE.
For a time all went well with her,
but the friend who had induced her j
'to remain in San Francisco and give
up -!â¢ theatrical career met reverses,
ko [/Ulan was thrown on her own re
sources. Her beautiful gowns, her
magnificent diamonds and her jewels
all went to the pawnbrokers and until
phe met Ed Smith she was in dire dis
tress. - '
,* Smith came to her rescue, took her
jewels 'out and lavished upon her the
luxuries that are the portion of a
queen. Just prior to her departure on j
April 9 she intimated to some of her j
boon companions that "her man" had !
"fixed her plenty." She added that â¢
Fhe 'was going to Europe to cultivate
her voice and that she had "wads of
dough" to spend while she lived in the
whirl of gay Paris.
â¢ A day or two previous to her de
parture she made a calling tour in an
automobile tojjid farewell to a coterie
of her friend*. ' She told some of her
set that she was going to Paris and
to others she said she was going to '
take a southern trip.
As A sport at the race track, it Is
reported, none could equal her. She
not only enjoyed the excitement of the
races, but loved to mingle with the en
vironment of the betting crowd. She
always had plenty of money to wager
and* was always supplied with stable
Feci*ets and tips that seemed to come
direct from those who knew. Her 1
Josses were not heavy. She was wont
to spend her winnings with a lavish
hand and whenever she won it was the ]

learn the exact amount for which It
would be liable.
From all appearances f]dward Smith
planned to make a clean-up before
leaving the city. Lat*t Thursday morn
'np he presented to Chief Deputy
Treasurer JiOiils A. Devoto a personal
check on the Crocker- Woolworth Bank
for 115.590 08 and received bills and
coin for the amount. Smith told De
voto that when the United Railroads
pent up silver to redeem the check in
payment of its taxes, then the check
was to be given to it. Devoto thought
'.he transaction a regular one and did
not hesitate to give Smith the amount
â¢if the check. When the check was
presented at the bank Devoto was
thunderstruck to hear that there were
no funds to Smith's nredit. Devoto's
part in the transaction was made thr;
subject of an inqÂ«iiry by the Grand
Jury yesterday afternoon. Devoto said
he was perfectly honest in the
matter, but he could not sat
isfactorily explain why he had
cashed a personal check of Smith's. He
has come to ths conclusion that he was
ieceived by a man whom he considered
one of nis best friends. This transac
tion would appear to Increase the
shortage to ?54.703 3G, and may In
volve the Treasurer's office in the
meshes of the case. It would seem to
show that laxity was shown in the sys
tem of collecting taxes by check, of
which Smith took advantage.
DEVOTO CASHES CHECK.
Devoto said that Smith came to him
last Thursday morning and told him
he wanted him to take $30,590 08 in sil
vor from the United Railroads in pay
ment %f its taxes, at the same time
handing Devoto a check for the
rmount. I 'evoto told Smith that he
could not take so much sliver, as he
had already tp.ken $30,000 from the
company at Smith's request. At that
time Smith telephoned to Treasurer
Starr of the United Railroads in De
voto's presence, telling Starr just what
denominations of coin to send to the
Treasurer's office. When Devoto re
fused to take the $30,590 08 in silver.
Smith took the check back and gave
h'm the check for $15,590 08, which De
voto foolishly cashed. Whether Smith
cashed the check for 530.590 08 will not
be known until further investigation,
but if he did the money will swell the
shortage- to that extent. The apparent
shortage on the Tax Collector's books
is $39,113 2Â«, but the juggling of big
checks by Smith has complicated mat
tprs.
Treasurer Starr of the United Rail-"|
roads informed Deputy Treasurer Per
kins that he held receipted bills for all !
the taxes of the corporation. A bus- j
piclous circumstance noted by Starr
was that when the first $30,000 was paid
to Tax Collector Smith in silver he
handed Starr the check, saying: "Don't j
put this in for a coupl* of days." Starr,
however, put the cherk through at
once.
FORMER BIG SHORTAGE.
Regarding: Smiths shortage of
$165,000 last year Deputy McCabe told
the Mayor that the Supervisors' Fin
ance Committee was aware of the
shortage at the time. The Mayor ex
pressed surprise that the facts had not
been brought to his notice at the time,
as he could have suspended Smith and
averted this second defalcation. Su
pervisor, Brandenstein, chairman of
the Finance Committee, when inter
viewed said that the committe had no
knowledge of the shortage.
"All we knew," said Brandenstein,
"was that there was a check for $198,
000 on deposit in the City Treasurer's
office which represented the taxes of
the United Railroads. The check was
drawn on the American National
Bank. We wanted the check cashed
at once and as we could not find
Smith City Treasurer McDougald and
myself went to the bank and made a
demand for the coin. At first the pres
ident of the bank told us that it was
a private check of Smith's and as
sured us that everything was all right.
In a day or two the money was paid
into the city treasury and the Incident
was closed so far as we were con
cerned."
The fact that the check instead of
the money was on deposit In the city
treasury would indicate that Smith
had allowed the bank to utilize the
coin, the check being merely a memo
randum that the taxes of the corpo
ration had been paid, thus preventing
the company from being charged with
delinquency.
SMITH TO BE IXDICTKD.
It is said that the Grand Jury was
preparing to indict Tax Collector
Smith last week for irregularities, but
the case was postponed pending the
fixing of the actual amount of the de
linquency in the payment of taxes. The
indictment will probably be returned
to-day, which will obviate the neces
sity of swearing to a complaint Mayor
Schmitz notified the Police Depart
ment to put detectives on the case
with the view of apprehending Bmith.
but it Is thought that he is beyond the
border by this time.
Besides taking the ; city's : funds.
Smith is said to have obtained more
than $1000 from I. Franklin, a money
broker, and also a large amount from
one McDonald, a L broker at 6 Eddy
street. It is said that the Grand Jury
has - been investigating the V alleged
putting through : of : "dummy" demands'
in the tax office for salaries last 1 * Oc
tober , and . November, whereby some
$4500 was mulcted from the city. â¢â¢â¢â 
. -Smith's downfall is attributed large-
I ly to his passion for gambling on horse
races. It Is said that" Eddy !;Cdnroy,'
who- handled a combination ' book at
the races, visited Smith every morn
ing for the purpose of placing his bets
for - the day. ilt is said that 1 much sof
i the money stolen by Smith went into 5
\ the : pockets of the bookmakers. Smith
â lived with his wife : f and little daugh
ter at 839 Fair; Oaks street. The prop-
A[y belongs to ' him, but t\ is \ heavily
|wprtgaged. r He I also i owns ? v ai" drug
HMre at the corner of Eddy - ? and Tay
ilQÂ»6treGts. What possessed him to

TO J NAME SUCCESSOR.
" fT;he appointment \ of ' â a * successor to
1 Tax Collector Smith will be made? by
Mayor 'Schmitz under the charter pro
vision providing that "when a vacancy
occurs in any â¢office i and 'â¢ provision is
not otherwise i made * in i the i charter *or
by law for filling I the . same, the Mayor
shall appoint *a 1 suitable $ person to fill
such vacancy, who shall hold office for
' the f remainder of ' the " unexpired ? term."
The Mayor, ? v.*however. >.willS not an
nounce the appointment until- the Board
of Supervisors ', has r taken action on his .
notice suspending Smith. If the sus
pension is approved by fourteen mem
bers of the board, then the suspended
officer, under the -provisions of the
charter, shall thereby be removed
from office.
With the removal of Tax Collector
Smith It is probable that several of his
deputies will lose their positions.
These are Chief Deputy James W.
Simpson, Cashier Hugo Herzer and E.
H. Hulford and Expert Searcher Si
Gunst. The other employes in the
office are all under civil service.
E. Black Ryan produced a check be
fore the Grand Jury for $14,735 03
which was indorsed by Smith and City
Treasurer John E. McDougald. Ryan
said that the check represented his
second payment for taxes of the
Southern Pacific Company. Ryan said
he had the receipted tax bills for the
first check he had turned over to
Smith for $24,378 32, but he has not
yet received the bills for the second
amount. He considered, however, that
the check indorsed by Treasurer Mc-
Dougald was documentary evidence
that the Southern Pacific Company
had settled its obligations with the
city. It is a fact, however, that there
is no record on the Tax Collector's
books that the second installment of
the taxes has been paid. So far as the
records stand Ihe Southern Pacific
Company is delinquent in the pay
ment of its taxes.
PIOUS FUND CASE
LOS ANGELES, April 26. â At thÂ«
request of the attorneys representing
Mrs. Robert P. Troy of San Francisco,
widow of the late United States Sena
tor Stenlien M. White, the deposition
of Superior Judge Charles Monroe,
former law partner of Senator White,
was taken to-day for use in a suit
which will be tried at Redwood City
May 2, In which all the particulars
of the famous Pious fund case will be
brought out. In the suit Mrs. Troy
seeks to recover from John T. Doyle
of Menlo Park $20,000 alleged to be
due as a fee earned by the late Sen
ator In bringing to a successful con
clusion the controversy waged for
many years between the Roman Cath
olic church of California and the re
public of Mexico, which was finally
decided in favor of the church by The
Hague international tribunal.
Judge Monroe was able to add but
little direct evidence which will be of
use, but he turned over to Mrs. Troy's
representatives copies of the volumin
ous correspondence which passed be
tween White and Doyle, in which the
Senator's claim is said to have been
acknowledged. Associated with Doyle
in the long negotiations over the fund
was former Senator William Stewart
of Nevada, and by the terms, of a con
tract between them and the prelates
of the church they were to receive
one-fourth of such amounts as might
be paid in full settlement of the claim.
It was necessary that the United
States Government make a formal de
mand upon Mexico for the money and
after years of labor Doyle and Stew
art were unable to interest the United
States Government. White was em
ployed to bring this about and for
five years he worked on it and finally
during the McKinley administration
he Induced the State Department to
make the demand, thus giving to the
case an international status and mak
ing it subject to reference to The
Hague tribunal. Doyle and Stewart
each, received $62,500 cash when the
claim was paid, but Doyle, whom
White represented personally, failed,
it is alleged, to pay White's claim de
spUe a contract that White was to re
ceive one-third of the one-fourth
which the others received. The cor
respondence, it is said, shows that
Doyle once offered Senator White's
widow $250. thus acknowledging that
some just claim existed against him.
The former Mrs. White sues for $20,
000, which is about one-third of the
amount Doyle received.
STRIKE SPREADS AMONG
TEAMSTERS IN CHICAGO
Rioting Breaks Out Afresh ajid Police
Are Kept BuÃy Quieting Dis- -
turbances.
CHICAGO. April 26.â Instead of twine set
tled, as was predicted last night, the strike
of the teamsters at th,e establishment of Mont
gomery W'arri & Co. has spread to other firms,
and the Indications to-night are that before
the controversy is finally adjusted a general
strllca of the union teamsters employed
throughout the city will bÂ« called.
The demani of the Chicago Employers' As
sociation that all teamsters deliver goods to
Montgomery Ward & Co. under penalty of in
stant dischftrpe resulted to-night In the spread
of the strike to four other business establish
ments.' These are: Carson Pirle, Scott &
Co.. Marshall Field & Co.. J. V. Farwell &
Co. and the Forbes Cartage Company.
While to-day's events were paving the way
for the general strike of the union teamsters,
rioting broke out afresh in "several parts of
the city. Nor -union drivers of the Employ
ers' Teaming Company were assaulted and
stoned and th<?lr horses cut from the traces.
During the entire afternoon the police were
kept busy In quieting disturbances.
MOB BREAKS INTO JAIL
AND SHOOTS A PRISONER
Works for Three Hours With Axea
and Sledge Hammer to Enter
the Prison.
PHREVEPORT, La., April 26.â After work-
Ing three hours with sledge hammers and
pick axes a mob of twenty-five men broke
into the parish jail at Homer. La., seventy
five miles northeast of Shreveport to-day and
shot Dick Craighead, a white man, inflicting
wounds which will probably prove fatal.
Craighead was charged with the murder of
Mrs. Isaac McKee, wife of his half-brother,
and her little son.
The authorities were unaware of the design
upon the prisoner until It was too late to
protect him. Every telephone and telegraph
wire out of Hemer was cut and the rifles ot
the local militia company were seized before
the movement was made on the Jail.

GRAVE CHARGE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 26. â Ira B. Me
Mahill. for the paÃt four years secre
tary of the Chamber of Commerce,
was arrested this afternoon on - a
charge of embezzling $90}. belonging to
that organization. The complaint was
sworn to by Joseph H. Rucker, a mem
ber of the board of control of the
chamber. Bail was fixed at $15,000
and up to a late hour to-night, Mc-
Mahill had been unable to obtain
bondsmen.
William H. Stacy, an expert, was put
to work on Secretary McMahill's books
yesterday and to-day he reported that
he had found a shortage of $1500. He
has not had time to complete.his work,
but It Is known that the shortage will
exceed that amount. Rumors have it
that there Is a shortage of $3500.
The $901 which McMahill is accused
of embezzling was a part of the exposi
tion fund raised by taxation and turn
ed over to the Chamber of Commerce
to make a display of the Santa Clara
County resources at the St. Louis
World's Fair. The fund amounted to
about $14,000. When the committee
had finished its work it had a balance
of $901 left. The Chamber of Com
merce was about to turn this over to
the Supervisors and ask that U be ex
pended at the Lewis and Clark Ex
position, when it was found that Mc-
Mahill had taken the money. For
some weeks there has been a suspicion
that there was a shortage in the Cham
ber of Commerce and President Schel
ler appointed a committee of investi
gation, which ended in to-day's arrest.
Besides taking the $901 McMahill, the
members of the chamber charge, col
lected the rent for the leased space In
the Santa Clara County headquarters
in San Francisco and pocketed it.
A stormy session was held In the
Chamber of Commerce t5-day between
President Scheller and the board of
control and Secretary McMahill. The
secretary was accused of being a de
faulter. He admitted taking the
money, but claimed the Chamber of
Commerce was Indebted to him several
thousand dollars, declaring that he was
to have had a commission on the col
lections. President Scheller denies
that McMahill had any agreement by
which he was to secure a commission.
The arrest of McMahill created a
sensation, as he is one of the best
known young men in the city. He
came here about five years ago from
Los Angeles, where he had been em
ployed as a newspaper reporter.
BIGELOW ALSO
OWES ESTATE
MILWAUKEE, Wls., April 2Â«?.â
Frank G. Bigelow, yÂ»e defaulting bank
president, when interviewed to-day,
said:
"I owe John I. Brodhead, one of the
\ heirs of the estate of E. F. Broadhead,
$100,000. I expected Mr. Broadhead would
j reach the city to-day, but up to a late
hour this afternoon he had not arrived.
I expect to make satisfactory arrange
ments with him when we meet with
regard to the amount of indebtedness
to him.
"I have resigned as executor of the
estate of Henry W. Payne, and will
I probably resign as executor of the
' Broadhead estate. These are the only
I estates with which I have any connec-
I tion. I have resigned as director of
! the Wisconsin Telephone Company and
severed my connection with the North
western Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany and the Milwaukee Electric Rail
way and Light Company."
It is known that Blgelow's holdings
in a large Milwaukee electrical concern
vere turned over to the bank some
time ago as collateral for loans, so that
his withdrawal from these enterprises
leaves him entirely free from any busi
ness propositions.
George P. Miller, also an executor of
the Payne estate, stated to-night that
he had closely scrutinized all the se
curities of that estate since Blgelow's
downfall and found them intact.
No successor has yet been chosen to
fill the vacancy of president of the
oank caused by the removal of Bige
low.
It can be stated positively that Bige
low will be prosecuted to the fall ex
tent of the law This statement was
made by one of the directors to-night.
Everything at the bank was normal to
day.
Henry M. Coll, the missing cashier
of the bank, had not been apprehended
up to a late hour to-night.
KINGSTON. N. V.. April 2%â Frank
G. Bigelow. the defaulting president of

DEVOTO EXPLAINS
HOW THE DEFAULTER
ROBBED TREASURY
Accepts Smith's Check and Pays
Him Over $ 1 5,000 of the
City's Money.
STARTLING CARELESSNESS SHOWN
Louis A. Devoto, who was duped by
Edward J. Smith into cashing a check
for $16,290 with the city's money, has
aged twenty years since the news of
thÂ« Tax Collector's defalcation came
out. Devoto's mind seems to be in
a hazy condition from the shock and
his accounts of his dealings with Smith
are complicated and contradictory.
He believes that in addition to the
$16,290. Smith has secured $14,735 from
the Treasurer's office through manip
ulating money of the United Railroads.
His account of the transaction reveals
startling carelessness in handling big
â urns and his confidence in Smith was ;
almost pathetic. He said:
6rr.:th came to me about two weeks Â»go and
â¢*ke<! me if I could handle $60,000 In silver
that he was going to get from the United
Railroads. I told him that I thought I could
handle half that arr-our.t. We had been ac
customed to doing that to oblige the company â
a sort of clearing-house business.

CIVIC LEAGUE
NAMES TICKET
BTOCKTON, April 26.â Stockton poli
ticians are upset to-nig;ht by the clever
coup of the Civic League in filing a
city ticket on the last day for filing
nominations for the city election, which
occurs on May 16. The league make 3
the point that the Republican and
Democratic parties did not file their
petitions for places on the primary bal
lot lrr time and the primary election
held wae illegal. The league will go
into the courts to prohibit the City
Clerk from placing the Republican and
Democratic tickets on the official bal
lot, and give place only to the inde
pendent ticket. Attorneys who have
advised the league say there is no ques
tion of the illegality of the primary
eiection. as the petitions were filed five
â¢oo late, and only the independent
ticket is legally on file. The Republi
can Ctty Committee met to-night and
decided to test the matter, and if the
Civic Ijp&giie petition is correct Repub
licans w;^ probably be urged to write
their ticket on the ballots they cast.
The Democratic committee will take
up the matter to-morrow night.
The ticket nominated by the Civic
L*agi>- :s headed by R. E. Wilhoit for
Mayor and the Council is made up of
four Republicans and four Democrats,
giving the Republican Mayor a decid
ing votf- in a tie. The other offices are
divided to suit the Republicans and
r>^!T>ocrats of the league. The nominee
superintendent of Streets is a Dem
â¢ â¢crat. A. G. Blum; the Assessor is a
Republican nominee, T. N. Moore, and
the Auditor is A. H. Wright, the Re
publican nominee.

ITALY'S QUEEN
TO VISIT JAPAN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, April 26. â Queen Margher
ita of Italy is planning to make a trip
to Japan after the conclusion of peace
between Japan and Russia and will
return to Italy by way of the United
States, landing at some Pacific Coast
port and touring the principal cities
on her way across the continent.
Queen Margherita's admiration for
everything Japanese dates back many
years. She has always been fond of
Japanese art and keenly interested in
Japanese history and customs.
Her arrangements are now com
plete for the trip when peace is in
sight. She will be given a wonderful
welcome, for she will be the first
crowned head of Europe to visit Dai
Nippon.
In America she will be welcomed as
the only European sovereign who has
complimented American women by
appointing several of them as mem
bers of her household and ladies of
her court. Among the best known
American ladies in waiting are Princ
ess Brancaccio, formerly Miss Eliza
beth Hickson Field; Princess Vicou
aro, who was Miss Eleanor Spencer,
and the Countess Gianotti, who was a
Miss King.
SEQUOIA CLUB
CHRISTENS ITS
HEARTHSTONE
SALLY SHARP
It was something to be a "Sequoian"
last night â it was, truly!
With salt and wine were the club
rooms at 584 Sutter street christened in
the name of good fun and good fello-w
ship â the blessedest gifts of the gods.
By a delightful arrangement, the
French Club and the Sequoia have ac
quired the upper floors of the new
Lloyd building, each retaining seven
rooms on either side of the structure.
Now, all this is very charming, as
was demonstrated last night, when the
Sequoia rooms became congested â
about 600 men and women making their
curtsy to the house committee â very
fetching with its aggregation of white
shoulders and pretty frocks.
When things -ere at their height Dr.
C. dt i lhaatreu, president of the french
Club, graciously placed its splendid re
ception rooms at the disposal of the
Sequoia â and it was accepted with a
deep spirit of appreciation, for it was
sorely needed.
That is nelghborliness, a thing akin
to godliness.
Every able-bodied club member on
the roster was in at the christening,
both in hofior of the great night and in
honor of the guest of the night, Charles
Warren Stoddard.
But alas: "for the best laid plans
of mice and men," the distinguished
writer was held at home by the un
reasoning tyranny of an attack of
rheumatism â a fact deeply deplored
by the clvb â and no doubt by the suf
ferer, fc-r rheumatism's no fun. Better
luck next time, however!
During the evening C. P. Neilson's
and Anna Frances Briggs" watercolors
came in for a large share of apprecia
tionâand justly so.
To be sure, there was a lot of pleas
ant chat, the guests standing for so
many distinct phases of society â
artists, writers, musicians, journalists,
artisans and the "listening half," the
blessed half that composes the neces
sary audience element, the part that
applauds.
Surely, never in recent years, has
so interesting a gathering of clever
men and women been brought to
gether as toasted last night to the
club's "good cheer and prompt dues" â
a toast drunk from a bowl of brave
capacity, in nectar brewed by The
Wise Ones of the club.
Sweet was the melody loosed during
the fleethig hours, when the Carusi
Quintet sang about a "red, red rose,"
followed by Miss Helen Heath, whose
dramatic voice won loads of laurels.
Yes, 'twas a memorable night â a
night that will live long, this christen
ing of the Sequoia hearthstone.
"Tis something to be a Sequoian.

HEAD DEPUTY
TELLS STORY
OF STEALINGS
J. W. McCabe . Saus
Smith Stole From
Cltu Before.
Returns Moneu He
Took From Sharon
Estate.
The thefts of Tax Collector Edward
J. Smith have extended over a period
covering more than a year and during
that time the missing city official has
appropriated more than $200, 600 to
his own uses. Most of this money was
repaid by his brother James, the lat
ter devoting his own private fortune to
keeping his relative out of the peni
tentiary. James McCabe, the chief
deputy, says Smith's present shortage
is represented mostly by the railroad
taxes, amounting to nearly $40,000.
McCabe said last night:
I have been in the Tax Collector's office
since 1881, and I probably know more about
the workings of the place that any other man
in the City Hall. That Smith was doing
wrong for some time was my own private
opinion, though I did not speak to any one
about it. neither did I play detective on the
man in order that I might find out what he
was doing with certain funds.
I managed to find him out, though, in several
Instances, and on one of these occasions I
went right to him when I discovered he had
misappropriated J.30.C00. He did not admit
having stolen the money, but the next day
he managed to get the amount and pay it
back. This represented taxes from the Sharon
estate.
What made me suspicious of Smith was the
way in which he was living. Although I did
not come in very close contact with him and
knew absolutely nothing about his private af
fairs, I could see that he 'was going a pace
that no man with a salary of $40tX> a year
could afford to travel. I kehw it must end
some time, and I thought the climax would
be reached even sooner than it was.
McCABE MAKES DISCOVERY.
The matter was made public through a dis
covery I made. Last Monday shortly after 10
o'clock 1 went into the check room and looked
over the check books. To my amazement I
discovered that the taxes of the railroad com
pany ha<l seemingly not been paid, though
that corporation had always been In the habit
of settli-ne its account promptly.
I rang ur> Mr. Ryan at the railroad offlc*,
and he replied that the taxes had been col
lected by Smith several days before. The first
check, amounting to a little less than $24,000.
wae paid on April 4 and the last check, which
represented about i?l 8,000, was turned over to
Smith personally on April 20.
My suspicions were then aroused, and I went
directly to Cashier Jack Smith, Eds brother,
â¢nd told him what I had discovered. Jack
seemed to fear the worst, for Ed had not been
seen around the City Hall since the previous
Thursday evening. I told Jack I did not want
to play detective or press tho matter, but that
it was better the whole thing .should be laid
bare.
I took Jack over the books and showed him
everything. He broke down and nearly
collapsed. He finally mustered up courage and
decided to lay the matter before the Mayor.
We made a rigid examination of the accounts
and discovered the exact amount missing. To
gether with a stenographer, we went into the
Mayor's office and Jack Smith told the execu
tive everything, though he nearly collapsed
before the sad scene had ended and the Mayor,
too. was visibly affected.
PAYS BACK LARGE AMOUNT.
Smith was forced to make good about $30,000
to the Sharon estate and the Hlbernia Bank a
short time ago. I managed to find out he had
misappropriated the money by the merest nc
cident. I was in the bank last February and
while there I began to talk to Mr Buckley
I asked htm about the taxes and spoke of the
duplicate roll. He told me the bank had paid
the taxes on the Palace Hotel property,
mortgaged to the institution by the Sharon
estate. The taxes amounted to $7400.
I was surprised at this, lor In my roll book
the taxes to the amount of $7400 had been
entered up against the Sharon estate. L'pon
further Investigation 1 discovered Smith had
g^nc and collected a!! the Sharon estate taxes,
but had not turned the money into the offic*
or said anything about it.
The total amount, including the $7400 which
was duplicated, represented about $30,000. I
knew Smith had taken the money and on
February 28, 1905, I went right to him and
demanded an explanation. He refused to.ad
mit having stolen the money, hut promised to
make good the amount. He kept his word and
the next day produced the full amount he had
taken, so the matter wae husiw up and 1
said nothing more.
Now, where he had secured that big amount
or coin in such a chort space of time I do not
know. 1 did not inquire, though It seemed
strange to mr- that he should have be*>n able
to lay his hands on the money so quickly.
BROTHER TO RESCUE.
I know positively that James Smith came to
his brother 9 rescue in April, 1904. and out of
his own private fortune paid $105,000 in order
that his brother might not be placed b'hlnd
prison bars and smirch the name of a 'good
lamily. His own brother, Jack, told me of
this one day in the office.
Jack came to me and Eald that Ed had
takrn a large amount of money and that his
bonds were practically worthless. He realized
that the doors of the penitentiary were about
to swing open for him and consequently he
went to his brother James and implored the
latter to save him from disgrace.
James Smith drew $1C5,C00 of his own private
fortune and paid it all out so that Ed might
escape prosecution. Ed was on his last legs
at that- time and had net his brother res
cued him his wrongdoing would have been
made known within a few days and all would
have been over
The matter was hushed up at the time and
rone snve the two brothers and myself knew
anything of It. I did not know before that
time that Smith was short in hie accounts,
though I felt that everything waa not all
right. How he had managed to secure this
money 1 do not know, though he possibly
annexed It by the same process as in the other
cases and settled It before any one had a
chance to go over the books.
Mayor Schmltz insisted that I take charge
of the tax office for the remainder of the
term, but this I positively declined to do. I
consented to assume the responsibilities for the
balance of the fiscal year, but after that time
I will step down and out. I do not want the
position and they cannot force, it upon me.
I have bcon in the office for nearly twenty
five years, but if I cannot manage to shift the
responsibility of taking Smith's place for the
balance of the term I wfil resign. If I wore
elected to the office I would accept it, but not
under the present circumstances.

POLICE BEGIN
ACTIVE HUNT
FOR FUGITIVE
Officers In Various
Towns Watching
for Smith.
Captain Burnett Sans
Defaulter Mau Be
In South.
Detective Captain Burnett has done
everything possible to intercept the
flight of Defaulter Smith, but with the
five days' start he may make his get
away. The police bulletin which is to
be issued this morning contains a de
scription of the defaulter which may
assist greatly in identifying any sus
pects arrested on suspicion of being the
Tax Collector wanted here. On account
of the lateness of the report of the de
falcation, a picture of Smith was not
printed in the report, but all the ave
nues of escape are being closely
watched.
When Captain Burnett heard of the
embezzlement he immediately cabled
Honolulu, but he does not think that
Smith would try this means of escape
on account of its being so hard for a
criminal to exist there without bect-m
ing a suspect. The detectives have
wired the police in all the towns of the
the out-of-California routes to look out
for Smith, but the captain is inclined
to the belief that Smith went to Los
Angeles and whatever further escape
he may have made has been from
there.
Since the embezzler is a man not used
to privation, he having lived a life of
comparative luxury, it is not thought
that he will segregate himself to any
extent from his fellows, and as he has
not traveled much he will be on his
own resources. A great many of the
felons from the United States have
crossed the line to Mexico, but Captain
Burnett does not think, with the pres
ent extradition laws of Mexico and the
United States, it will be a hard problem
to get him once he is discovered in
Mexico.
MAY HAVE IiEFT COUNTRY.
The theory of the detectives is that
Smith will stay in some city where he
can live as he did at home, but he may
have gone to Honduras, in Central
America, where a colony of criminals
is said to exist there under police pro
tection, and it would be impossible to
return him to the United States be
cause of the absence of extradition
laws between our country and Hondu
ras.
Following out their system, descrip
tions will be sent by local police to
every constable, sheriff, chief of police
and every city in the country will be
on the alert to capture him. Mexico
has alreadr been notified and the po
lice there are watching for the defaul
ter. He may have doubled on his trail
and gone north from Los Angeles or
from here, so the police in the north
ern cities are watching every outgoing
boat and arriving train.
It is not thought possible that he has
come back to San Francisco to remain
in hiding, as he is well known here,
having canvassed the city in two elec
tions and having been a resident for
many years. Wherever he goes out
side of the State he will be a stranger
because he has never traveled much
and because of the absence of friends,
who might aid him, the police think
it will be only a question of time when
he will be forced to come where they
will get a clew as to his whereabouts.
The rural police of Mexico have been
instructed to arrest every suspicious
character and all persons who cannot
give a satisfactory explanation of their
presence in the country. Without
friends Smith will have a hard time to
hide in Mexico, as he cannot speak
Spanish and the natives are becoming
distrustful of the American who comes
into their country without visible pur
pose to live.
MAYOR SENDS FOR CHIEF.
Because of the theory that he went
to Los Angeles, Smith could have gone
East as well as to Lower California.
The trip to Los Angeles takes twenty
two hours, giving him a four days'
start from there In whatever direction
he chose.
Chief of Police Dinan and Captain
Burnett were sent for by the Mayor,
who informed them of Smith's disap
pearance and the shortage in his ac
counts. The Mayor urged them to use
every effort to trace the fugitive.
Captain Burnett said:
I have known Ed Smith for twenty-five
years and he Is about the last man I would
have suspected of doing anything of the kind.
Ho was not a drunkard nor a spender of
money but rather the reverse, and I nevei
heard of his associating with dissolute people.
His business seemed to be prosperous and I
always understood that his domestic relations
were happy. The last time I met him he
seemed to be as jovial as could be and acted
as If he hadn't a care In the world. His
father was an honored member of the Police
Department and his brother William was also

IjOS ANGEI-ES POIiICE ACTIVE.
LOS ANGELES, April 26.â Acting
upon a telegraphic request from the
San Francisco Police Department,
Chief of Police Hammel tQ-night put
practically every member of the Los
Angeles detective force to work in an
effort to locate Edward J. Smith, the
fugitive San Francisco Tax Collector.
The telegram indicated that the San
Francisco authorities believed Smith
had come to Los Angeles.
Armed with a complete description of
the fugitive, the detectives are to-night
making a systematic search of all ho
tels and rooming-houses; interviewing
persons who are known to know Smith
and who would be likely to know of his
whereabouts if here, but as yet their
efforts have resulted in not the slight
est trace of the much wanted man. The
Los Angeles officers do not believe
Smith came here. The fact that he is
wanted was published here this after
noon and the officers assert that it is
improbable that he would openly an
nounce he was coming to this city if
he intended to seek a refuge where he
would be safe until such a time as
would be necessary to escape from the
country. They are, nevertheless, de
voting their entire time to the search
There was an exchange of telegrams
between the two police departments
late to-night, the nature of which was

GRAND JURY
IS STARTLED
BY THE NEWS
Calls Devoto Before It
and Hears His
Statement.
Deputu Seems Almost
on the Verge of
Collapse.
That Tax Collector Smith was a de
faulter was startling news to Fore
man Andrews of the Grand Jury. That
body has had the Tax Collectors of
fice under investigation for several
days, but had gained no inkling as to
what Smith had been doing.
As soon as he heard that the short
age was discovered Foreman Andrews,
with the assistance of Expert Young,
began an Investigation and learned of
the shortages that are known.
Neither Foreman Andrews nor Ex
pert Young could arrise at an accur
ate estimate of the defalcations. The
rough estimate given out places the
amount at between $54,000 and $69,
000, approximately.
Devoto was in â  state bordering on
collapse when examined by Foreman
Andrews and it was difficult to get
anything like a connected story from
him. He admitted that during the last
twelve months he had cashed for
Smith checks amounting to more than
a quarter of a million dollars. "He
will be held personally responsible for
the money that the defaulting Tax
Collector got from the Treasurer's of
fice.
RAILROAD PAYS TAXES.
The Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors, consisting of
Supervisors d'Ancona, Brandenstein
and Payot and Secretary Charles Fay.
were called into consultation. While
they were puzzling over the manipu
lation of the money of the Southern
Pacific Company a hint of Smith's
dealings with the Treasurer's office
was found, and Devoto was called. He
at first declared that only $15,290 08
had been sscured by Smith, but later
admitted that he believed that $14,
735 might also have been taken. De
voto was willing to tell all that he
knew, but was in such a nervous state
that it took some time to get a clear
statement from him.
E. Black Hyan, tax attorney for the
Southern Pacific Company, declared
that the company's installment of
taxes had been paid in full and that
Smith's personal receipts had been re
ceived for $39,113. The money was
paid to the Tax Collector in the fol
lowing sums: April 4, $17,683 76 and
$6694 56, and on April 18, $9424 12
and $5310 84. These checks were
cashed by Smith and form the largest
items of his defalcations.
Ryan declared that he knew of noth
ing wrong until he received a tele
phone messape from James McCabe
in the Tax Collector's office asking
why they were delinquent in their
taxes.
"Why, the taxes have been paid to
Mr. Smith," he replied "We have the
receipts, end the checks we gave him
have been cashed."
A. A. Simpson of the license office
told Foreman Andrews that Smith had
been in the habit of cashing checks for
aums amounting to $200 and $300 in
his department. It cannot be esti
mated how much the defaulting cashier
secured in this manner. It is not
thought, however, that the total will
aggregate more than $3000.
COVERED BY BOND.
Members of the Finance Committee
of the Supervisors declared that they
did not know anything of any shady
transactions in the Tax Collector's of
fice until they were informed that a
big shortage had been discovered. The
fact that Tax Collector Smith had been
short $165,000 about a year ago and
that the deficit had been made good by
his brother had not been reported to
them.
As all Smiths defalcations are cov
ered by a $100,000 bond furnished by the
National Surety Company of New
York, the Grand Jury, according to
Foreman Andrews, will take no im
mediate action in the affair other than
to investigate fully the amount of the
loss. Devoto_ will be held responsible
for the money he gave Smith on the
repudiated check. Devoto is backed
by a bond of $10,000.
"The affair is startling," said Fore
man Andrews. "It is an eye-opener on
the lax methods employed in municipal
offices. Why, if this sort of 'system'
is employed by other departments the
money of the people is at the mercy of
any grafter.
"If I had known of the previous
shortagfis in the Tax Collector's office
the Grand Jury would have accom
plished the removal of the man from
office ar. the time. But I did not have
even an inkling that anything waa
wrong. The jury can do nothing now.
Of course, the city will not lose any
thing by the defalcation, but this ought
to open the eyes of the people of San
Francisco. The methods of the Treas
urer's office will be thoroughly in
vestigated."

TREATY FAVORED
â¢ BERLIN. April 26. â The Imperial
. Oflvernment, preparatory to excluding
the United States from the privileges
*Â»â  c' the new reciprocity treaties signed
recently with seven European states,
has formally notified the American
.Government that the tariff agreement
between Germany and the United
6tates of July 10, 1900, will terminate
on March 1, 1906, the day the new
treaties go into effect, but that Ger
znany stands ready to negotiate a reci
j prociiy treaty with the United States.
This notification says that the
treaties concluded with Russia, Italy,

and Servia "form a new basis for the
commercial relations of Germany and
the imperial Government holds, itself
prepared to enter into negotiations for
a "new commercial treaty with the

The German view, as held at the

* OPINION IN WASHINGTON.
. ."WASHINGTON. April 26. â It Is ad
â¢ mitted at the Stale Department that
-pourparlers have been In progress
lor the last three months between the
American embassy at Berlin and the
â¢ German Foreign Office respecting the
effect upon the existing reciprocity
â¢ agreement between America and Ger
irrany of the new trade treaties con
cluded between Germany on one side
â¢ and Belgium. Italy. â¢ Austria- Hungary,
Roumanta. Russia, Switzerland and
â Eerv>a on the other, but so far Em
fcassador Tower has not notified the
â¢Jepartment that the German Govern
ment has decided to terminate the
P existing arrangement.
T-he effect of a formal declaration
of ;hat kind would be very serious, it
Is feared, and Tower is now engaged
in one of the most difficult and com
, plex tasks which he has yet been
â¢ called upon to discharge. If the ar
. rangement is denounced and" no sub
'...Btitute is found, then it may be that
the United States and Germany will
soon become involved in a tariff war
â¢which would certainly prove disas
trous to one or both of the principals,
. In Ham of the vast amount of trade
â¢ between the two countries which
would be affected.
;â¢ HISTORY" OF THE CASE.
In Jaly, ISOO, a reciprocity arrange
ment was entered into between Amer
ica and Germany under section 3 of
the Dlngley act, whereby in return
for a reduction câ¬ duty on German
JDrandies, Btill wines and works of art
entering the United States Germany
cgreed to give United States products
Ihe benefit of tariff reductions accord
ed to the European countries above
named. Germany now has drawn new
.conventions with those countries
changing the tariff rates and is dis
posed to refuse the United States the
T>enefit of these special rates under
/the old Dingley convention. The State
Department holds that the new con
tentions are really nothing more than
â amendments of the original treaties
And that therefore the spirit of the
.Dlngley act agreement would seem to
.cause it to apply with equal force to
.the new conventions. Correspond
ence is now passing to clear up this
â¢flifference of views.
In the background is a well recog-
Eized purpose on the part of the Ger
man Government to cause the United
States to greatly enlarge the list of ar
ticles named in the Dlngley agree
ment, but as these are limited special
ly !n the Dingley act that object can
D* attained only by the negotiation of
an entirely new reciprocity treaty.

ST. PETERSBURG, April !Â«.â
American superiority over foreign
rivals again triumphs In the complete
success which has crowned the visit
of Charles M. Schwab to St. Peters
burg. Schwab's negotiations with the
Russian Admiralty have resulted in the
practical conclusion of an arrange
ment for the construction of a num
ber of formidable llne-of-battle ships of
a type which probably will startle the
world. Schwab will lÂ«avÂ« Su Peters
burg to-morrow.
The details of thÂ« oonstruotlon of
the vessels remain to be worked out,
but in addition to those which will be
built in the United States it is quite
likely that a yard will be constructed
at a Baltic port, to be manned by
Russian workmen, but under Amer
ican enginering and mechanical super
vision. The Russian Admiralty is ex
tremely anxious to utilize the rehabili
tation of the navy for the encourage
ment of the shipbuilding industry at
home. In order to eventually render
the country independent of foreign
yards.
The Admiralty has accepted Schwab's
propositions strictly on their merits,
he having convinced the authorities
that he can produce for Russia war
ships vastly superior to anything now
afloat or at present projected by any
other Government. They will be mon
ster 16,000-ton vessels of enormous
horsepower and of a peculiar type,
combining the projectile-resisting
power of the battleship with the speed
and wide radius of action of cruisers.
They **... be delivered fully equipped
as to armor and ordnance.
The remarkable advance In naval
architecture and construction which
these American-built ships will mark
is a guarded secret, but it is believed
it will involve the use of nickel steel
of greater tensile strength, which, In
machinery, boilers, frames, etc., will
give greater power with decreased
weight. Schwab guarantees to create
vessels with 20 per cent higher ef
ficiency than any now existing.
It is understood, however, that not
all the ships will be built by the Beth
lehem Company, as the time for de
livery 1b a factor, Russia desiring that
the ships be turned over as early as
possible. While the Bethlehem Com
pany will supply the armor and ord
nance, other American yards therefore
will profit In the construction of the
hulls. This Is in accordance with the
wish of the Admiralty, the Russian au
thorities In placing such a larpre con
tract having no desire to arotise hos
tilities among rival commercial Inter
ests In America, the aim being not
only to take advantage of American
genius In building up the Russian
navy, but distinctly to cultivate closer
commercial relations between the two
countries.
It Is understood that no arrange
ments have yet been concluded with
French or German builders for the
ships which will be constructed in
thoKe countries.

DEADLOCK
ON CHINESE
EXCLUSION
Officials of United States
and the Diplomats of the
Orient Unable to Reach
Agreement as to a Treaty
MINISTER ROCKHILL
TO TAKE UP ISSUE
WASHINGTON. April 26.âNegotia
tions between the United States and
China for a treaty restricting the im
migration of Chinese to this country'
have been practically abandoned. It
has been found Impossible by the rep
resentatives of the two Governments to
reach a common ground of agreement
as to many of the terms of the pro
posed treaty. The whole subject, there
fore, is being held in abeyance until W.
W. Rockhill, the recently appointed
Minister of the United States to China,
will arrive in Peking.
When Wu Ting Fang was Minister
of China in this country he made an
exhaustive study of the Chinese Immi
gration question, ascertaining very
precisely, among other things, the
American point of view. He main
tained consistently that unjust re
strictions were thrown by this Govern
ment around the Immigration of Chi
nese, but was unable to RccompliHh
anything in the way of lowering the
barriers during his sojourn here. In
China he Is now in a position to make
it difficult, if not absolutely Impossi
ble, to negotiate a treaty unless the
convention shall have incorporated In
It certain provisions for which the
Chinese Government contends.
China is anxious to obtain in the
proposed treaty liberal definitions of
the terms "merchants," "travelers"
and "students," in order to relieve
such classes from embarrassment on
their arrival in the United States.
These classes now are admitted to the
country, but the restrictions thrown
around their entrance are severe. The
immigration authorities urge the ne
cessity for such restrictions because
of the issuance by Chinese officials, In
many Instances, of fraudulent certifi
cates Indicating that coolies are "stu
dents" or "merchants," and as such
entitled to admission. These certifi
cates have to be passed upon by
United States Consuls in China, but
they necessarily have to take the word
of the Chinese officials for the ap
plicant's standing, as they have neither
the time nor the appropriation to
make a personal Investigation of each
case.
Sir Chen Tung Liang Cheng, the
Chinese Minister, has been informed
frankly that much of the trouble ex
perienced by merohants and students
aribes from the action of the Chinese
officials In Issuing certificates that re
quire Investigation here.
When a tentative draft of the pro
posed treaty was prepared some time
ago It was laid before the Immigration
officials of the Department of Com
merce and Labor. Some parts of it
did not meet with their approval. The
suggestions they made did not suit
Sir Chen Tung Liang Cheng. This
brought tha negotiations practically
to an end, and there probably they
will remain until Minister Rockhill
shall reopen them in China.
An intimation is given in official
circles that the law, as It stands at
present, may be open to attack. If
the attack upon It should be made
by some of the numerous organizations
in this country interested in Chinese
immigration and carried to the Su
preme Court of the United States, the
result, 1n the absence of a treaty on
the subject, probably would be a flood
of Chinese to the United States.

STERN FAILS
TO IDENTIFY
THE SMITHS
Prosecution in the "Nan"
Patterson Trial Plays Ms
Tramp Card Without
the Expected Sensation
PAWNBROKER CANNOT
TRUST TILS MEMORY
NEW YORK, April 26. â The climax
In the prosecution of "Nan" Patter
son, who Is on trial charged with hav
ing 6hot "Caesar" Young, was reached
to-day when Hyrnan Stern, the pawn
broker, failed to identify J. Morgan
Smith as the man to whom he sold
the pistol with which Young was
killed. This feature had been looked
forward to with much interest and
was expected to make somewhat of a
sensation. On the contrary', however.
It caused but a ripple of comment and
surprise in the courtroom, although
it was the dramatic moment of the
trial. â¢
Stern also failed to Identify "Nan"
Patterson or Mrs. Smith as the wom
an who accompanied the man that
purchased the revolver.
Smith had been brought from Jail
to confront Stern and after the lat
ter's testimony Smith was taken back
to tha Tombs.
Riotous scenes attended the open
ing of the courtroom for the afternoon
session. Women and men fought to
gnt. past the police. Several women
fainted and the dresses of many were
torn.
Throughout ths entire day "Nan"
Patterson followed the testimony with
more intense interest than on previous
days and when adjournment was an
nounced she caressed her father and
remarked:
"I think this has been a good day
for me."
Only two witnesses for the prosecu
tion, "Caesar" Young's widow and his
racing partner, John Mlllin, remained
to be examined when the trial ad
journed this afternoon.
STERX FAILS TO IDENTIFY.
When Pawnbroken Stern went on
the stand Smith and his wife were
brought before him. The pownbroker
told the story of the purchase of the !
weapon and identified the pistol as the j
one he had disposed of.
Turning to "Nan" Patterson, As
sistant District Attorney Rand said:
"Look at the defendant. Don't you |
remember the lady who accompanied
the man who bought the revolver? Do
you recognize the defendant as the |
one?**
"I cannot say that she was," an- j
swered Stern.
"Look at Mrs. Smith. Was she the
one?"
"I cannot say that she was."
"Now look at J. Morgan Smith. Can
you say to the best of your Judgment
that Mr. Smith resembles the man who !
purchased ths revolver from you?'
Abraham Levy, the defendant's i
counsel, Jumped to his feet with an i
objection.
"Why can't he ask." he shouted, " 'Is
this the man who bought the revolv
er?' "
Stern replied: "I cannot say that he
is."
This ended Stem's testimony and
Smith was taken back to the Tombs.
MRS. SMITH ON STAND.
Mrs J. Morgan Smith was called to
the stand and was asked to identify a
letter addressed to Ada Patterson as
having been written by her sister.
This she did.
The story of the meeting between
Young and Mlbs Patterson in Harlem
the right before the tragedy was told
by William Luce, Young's brother-in
law. Young was at his home in West
One Hundrd and Fortieth street
and they went out together
about 11 o'clock. They met Miss Pat
terson In Elgthh avenue. Luce said
he left Young and Miss Patterson to
gether and went home with the under
standing that he would meet them an
hour later. At 1 o'clock he returned
and all three went to a saloon.
"We got Into the saloon about a
quarter past 1 o'clock," said Luce,
and at a quarter to 3 they came
over to the table where I was seated.
They had been together for nearly two
hours and they were angry and quar
reling."
"Did you hear any of the conversa
tion?"
"I heard Young say he would get her
a cottage,"
"When they came over to your
table, what was the converration
about?"
"About Young's going away. The de
fendant said she knew the boat he was
Kolng to sail on and said that he could
not get away from her. Young of
fered to bet her $100 that she could not
name the boat, but she replied that
she. would not please him by doing so.
She said Young could not hide from
her, and if he got down in the hold of
the ship she would find him and pre
vent him from sailing."
LAST TALK WITH YOUNG.
Luce said he saw Young before he
left home on the morning of June 4.
He said he was sroing out to get shaved
and buy a new hat. and that he would
Join his wife at the Bteamship pier.
Luce, in reply to a question by Rand,
denied that he purchased the revolver
at Stern's pawnshop.
Bernard L. McKean, another broth
er-in-law of Young, told of efforts
made by Young early in May to get
Miss Patterson to go to Europe. He
said she first promised to go abroad,
but afterward refused to sail, claim-
Ing she was in delicate health and
would have to undergo an operation.

(nil of the Vessel at Texas
City for Which It Is Named
.Marked by Great Friction
GAX.VESTOX. Tex.. April 26.â A
â¢tale of friction bordering almost on
mutiny is said to exist on the new
"United States cruiser Galveston. The
vtssel arrived here last "Wednesday on
her tnaiden trip to receive a silver ser
vice from the citizens of Galveston.
Testerday Commander Cutler ordered
his ship away from the wharves, where
ehe has been since her arrival, to an
anchorage in the roads, so that the
o3scers might be better able to control
the men, numbers of whom were leav
ing the ship and overstaying their
shore leave. Federal and municipal
officers have to-day returned nearly
two score of men found ashore, many of
whom were drunk. These men vigor
ously protested against the treatment
â wi.ich they allege is accorded them on
bcÂ»ard ship by Commander Cutler.
The :r.en. among them several petty
ofroers of long service, pronounce the
voyage of the Galveston the most un
bearable they have ever experienced.
Many of the men denounced the com
irander and state that they are over
worked and underfed. They claim that
for the most trivial offenses they are
given the extreme penalty and that
Ei:.ty of the men are in irons. The
mariner are said to be almost worn
fcut preserving order on board. â  The
cruiser sailed tor Norfolk to-day.

A XEW HOME FOR
THE BOX VIVA XT
Something new under the sun: A fit
expression when applied to the new Pea
cock Restaurant, which throws its doors
open to the public to-day. Beautifully
situated on Stockton street, overlooking
Union Square, it is unique and exceed
ingly artistic in all its appointments.
The scheme of decoration is novel in the
'extreme and is a conception worthy of a
great artist.
The main dininK-room is in white, with
blue panels and a frieze of peacocks "In
all their wealth of beautiful colorings.
The furniture is in green oak and har
monizes with the general tone of the
room.
The entrance tÂ© the second floor is in
the form of n Lounging-room. paneled In
weathered oak and furnished with Old
Mission furniture, a scheme which would
be heavy were it not for the warmth of
the red rugs. A massive old brick fire
place In one end lends a cheery atmos
phere to the whole.
The Colonial Room, with Its white wall
paper in old willow design, its dainty
lace curtains patterned after those at Mt.
Vernon. blue carpet and Colonial furni
ture, is simple in the extreme and very
homelike in effect, and follows out the
Colonial idea to the minutest detail.
The Russian Room is a marvel of
beauty, with its tiger skin carpet. Its gold
paneled walls, curtains embroidered with
the Russian coat-of-arms, rare ola
brasses and its massive furniture, which
gives an effect of luxurious comfort, and
will appeal to the most artistic taste.
The entire place is a symphony of color,
and the Cordes Furniture Co., which
has had the furnishing, are to be con
gratulated, as it shows the unusual skill
of their decorators. San Francisco
should welcome, a place of this kind, as
it certainly fills a long felt want.

Hermann Troebner Arrested
in New York on Complaint
of Charity Organization
' ' " â $â 
WOKKJS VABIOUB FAKES
His Business Assumes Pro-
portions Which Bequire
Aid of Salaried Secretary
NEW YORK, April 26. â Hermann
Wilhelm Troebner, "king of the
Schnorrers," as a band of professional
beggars is known here, is locked up
awaiting arraignment on several com
plaints by charity organizations.
Troebner, it is stated, has cleaned
; up tens of thousands of dollars in the
I past four or five years and the full
j list of persons from whom his unique
methods procured money would read
like a social register of New Tork.
I Troebner has lived at expensive hotels
and for years hrfs maintained a home
In Hoboken for his wife and child. He
Is said to have lost large sums in
gambling both here and in the West.
Under arrest with him Is hie secre
i tary, Otto Wittles, to whom he paid
I $25 a week to attend to the clerical
I work of his business.
Troebner began his operations as a
prSfessor of Sanskrit from Heidelberg
or Leipslc. University men, and espe
cially professors, were much in his fa
vor and hLs ptory generally was to the
effect that remittances from home had
failed to arrive, leaving him tem
porarily in need of funds. In 1902 he
was sentenced to six months' im
prisonment for mendicity. In that
case he used the name of Baron yon
Manteuffe].
Recently he returned to Xew York
and the charity organizations heard of
him through the officials of a copper
mining company, to whom he repre
sented himseif as an expert mining en
gineer. Te< hnlcal questions asked him
placed him under suspicion because
he failed to display much knowledge
on thr subject.
When arrested Troebner and his.
secretary were en route to Boston,
whence they expected to sail for Eng
land.
PROBING INTO
OIL INDUSTRY
James R. Garfield, Chief of the Bu- j
! reau of Corporations of the Depart- I
ment of Commerce, who has been spe- |
dally delegated by President Roosevelt ;
to delve into the affairs of the oil in
dustry of this country, and especially
those phases of it that concern the
operations of the Standard Oil Com
pany, arrived here yesterday from
Washington and is staying at the Pal
ace. An impartial view of the entire
situalion, in both the East and the
West, is what the President has re
quested Commissioner Uarfield to ob
tain, and in following out his lr.struc
tior.s the latter is proceeding with his
investigation in a manner that, pre
cludes the possibility of any strong in
fluences being exerted against him in
his work.
En route to San Francisco Commis
sioner Garfield stopped over In Kan
sas, where a bitter fight is being
waged between the producers and con
sumers and the Standard Oil Company,
and where the Legislature has taken a
hand in the fight with a view of forc
ing the oil trust to demean itself in a
manner conducive to better conditions
for the ordinary consumer and the op
pressed oil well man. He also spent
one day in Denver for the purpose of
gathering data, and after his work is
through here the Commissioner will re
turn to Missouri, where he will resume
his investigation. Discussing his mis
sion yesterday Commissioner Garfleld
said:
1 am investigating the oil industry in every
1 particular phase, troiri the well to the refinery,
, trom the middleman to the consumer and the
' methods of handling t)<e commodity by rail
I and water. My inquiries axe of the nature of
I a court of inquiry, that is, I do not hold
! court, but go about gathering such data aa
1 call upÂ«.;: me an tiie i-lrcumstances will per
' mit. 1 cannot *ay how long 1 will remain
lln San Francisco. It will be impossible for
i me to complete the work here and my plan
' is to arrange the details so that my assistants
. cen proceed with it as I continue on my tour
through the country. There will be no special
BeÂ»slodi in San Francifco nor will Information
be given out to the public until I have sub
mittod my report to the President and he
consents to Its publication.
Commissioner Garfield, who is the son
of the late President Garfield, is a
young man whom President Roosevelt
selected for this particular mission be
cause of his well known studious meth
ods of inquiry and because he has a
reputation for fearless energy that no
great influence opposed to an investi
gation of the oil trust might discour
age. He is accompanied on his tour by
two clever lawyers of Washington, who
assist him in interrogating people, and
a stenographer. One of the great evils
complained of in the control of the in
: dustry by the Standard Oil Company
!is the rebating of railroad rates in
fav>r of the trust, and this feature of
i the matter is receiving special atten
j tson from the < 'ommispioner. An hour
i after his arrival in San Francisco yes
terday Commissioner Garfleld had
' started on the local end of his investi
gation and kept going until late in the
I afternoon. _. _

Man Fights Against Death

Victim Describes His Sensa
tion While Being Over
come by Intense Cold
Stedal Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Neb., April 26. â With a
I revolver Emil Schwarz fought against
| death in an Icebox of a Union Pacific
; refrigerator car. After five days in
i that arctic atmosphere, he finally at
| tracted attention and gained release
by firing a pistol shot through the
roof of the car as a brakeman waa
i passing overhead.
Schwarz was en route to New York
from San Francisco and rode in the
refrigerator car from! Laramie, Wyo..
Ito Omaha. During the Journey he
; lost fifteen pounds in weight and when
i rescued both his feet were frozen so
that he could not stand. Describing
his experience Schwarz said:
"I did not suffer much until the
; third day. The car seemed to get
colder and colder and I feared to go
jto sleep. Staying awake is what
â¢ makes a fellow crazy. I felt a grind
' Ing pain in the stomach, as though
two big bones were rubbing together
, inside of me. I walked up and down
: the car until I dropped. The jolting
I of the car was terrible and a dizzy
! sickness came over me. A pricking
j numbness, as though my legs and
arms were going to sleep, made me
j ruh the flesh and I knew from the
coldness that I was freezing."
At every stop Schwarz made desper
i ate efforts to attract attention, but not
| even the firing of his pistol was heard
by any one on the outside until the
: fifth day.

WARNER'S SAFE CURE
O. F. Clements, the noted professional runner and one of the athletic trainer*
at Harvard Colleges says:
"Warner's Safe Cure did wonders for me. About a year ago I wai run down
from ovrr-ti alnlng on the track and in baseball. I suffered continually, and was
obliged to tir<~>p everything connected with athletics. One day a, friend recommend-
ed Waxrier'fl Safe Can as a general tonic and kidney builder. After trying a
sample bottle I began to feel brighter, and when three bottles were gone I had
regained my old-time athletic vigor and health.
"I heartily indorse the medicine, not only as. a tonic, but especially urn an In-
fallible cure for kidney troubles."
IF IN DOUBT MAKE THIS TEST:
Put some urine In a glass; after It stands 24 hours, if you find a reddish.
brick-dust sediment in it, or particles floating in the urine or the urine is milky
or cloiuly. you will know your kidneys are In a diseased condition and are unabl**
to perform their work: the result will bÂ« the bladder and urinary organs will h<*
come inflamed, urir acid will poison the blood, the stomach will become affected
and unable to digest the food, the system will become weak and the result will
be a break-down of the general health, with Brights disease or diabetes, which
will prove fatal if not treated with promptness and great care.
Cures Kidney Disease
Warner's Safe Cure is purely vegetable and contains no harmful drugs; It
does not constipate; it is a most valuable and effective tonic, and is a stimulant
to digestion and awakens the torpid liver, putting the patient into the very best
receptive state for the work of thÂ» restorer of the kidneys. Warner's Safe Pills
taken with Warner's Sate Cure move the bowls gently and aid a speedy cure.
WARNER'S SAFE Cl RE is now put up in two regular sizes and is sol<X by
all druggists, or direct, at 50 cents and $1.00 a bottle.
Beware of so-called kidney cure* which aza full of iedlmÂ«nt and of bad odor

Isswevei, have always been among those who
are lavish entertainers, and the luncheon at
which Miss Florence White was hostess to
day was quite up to the standard they have
always maintained. Miss Marlon Smith was
the motive for this charming affair, snd the
graceful scheme of adornment was carried out
In pink and green. The guests were: Miss
Smith, Miss Marion Goodfellow, Mis? Anita

largest and most brilliant affair yet g!vi;i by
that flourishing organization. Nearly 200
quests enjoyed the menu and delightful pro
gramme that followed, and as the rooms were
lighted artificially, the women In their
pretty spring costumes were at their best.
Yellow was the predominating color tone, al
though an abundance of Easter lilies also lent
a stately effect.
Mrs. Karl Nichol. a pretty little woman,
who Is ma prettier when she sings, was
heard in two very pleasing numbers, a difficult
Arditl composition. "The Meeting," and a
ballad, with violin obligate by Mr. Nichol.
Mrs. Raymonds Brooks also sang and, as usual
when she appearn, was encored egain and again.
Mis* L-K-ia Oliver also received on enthusiastic
recall after her clever rendition of "Mrs. Casey
at th^ Telephone" left the crowd In fine
humor wiih a reading of "Mark Twain's Wife
at the Telephone."
Mrs. Florence Gray, the eteb'l new presi
dent, in a graceful little talk, paid tribute to
the work dine by Mrs. Bunnell, the retiring
president, and told how the beard of directors,
!n ->r<ser to commemorate It ir> w>me fashion.
had decided to create the office of honorary
president and had bestowed that title upon
Mrs. Bunnell. ThÂ» directors' decision seemed
to meet with general approval and was ccn

Faculty Committee on Stu

ADAMS BROTHERS ANGRY
Injunction Against Issuing
College Annual Talked
Of and Excitement Reigns
BERKELEY, April 27.â A storm has
burst over the heads of Jackson Greg
ory and Prentlss Gray, juniors at the
university, who are respectively editor
nnd business manager of the
Blur and Gold annual that is
to be issued, according to pro
gramme, to-morrow morning. Com
plaint has been made to the faculty
committee on students' affairs by O. S.
Adams and D. S. Adams, seniors, who
are brothers, that the book contains an
indecent cartoon and matter accom
panying it, reflecting seriously upon
the brothers Adams, and constituting
an offense against good taste and the
rights of the men who are offended.
The faculty committee has issued a
peremptory summons to Gregory, wb/>
has been out of town since Monday, to
return at once and show cause why the
Blue and Gold should not be suppressed
in accordance with the petition of the
Adams brothers. The message from
the faculty to Gregory was sent by
wire, and Gregory is due to get into
town late this evening, when he will
appear before the faculty men unless
he can procure a stay of proceedings
in some manner.
The Adams brothers are jocularly
called the "butt-ins" of the senior class,
having been elected to that honorary
place by the class at its last election.
The affair is made the subject of a car
toon In the Klue and Gold, which de
picts the brothers looking into a build
ing and then looking: out, with lines be
neath that are considered by the
Adamses to be decidedly offensive.
Throughout the day there has been
talk of injunction proceedings by the
Adams brothers to restrain the Blue
and Gold men from putting out their
book to-morrow. Ezra Decoto, gradu
ate manager of student affairs, who is
also an attorney, has assured the man
agers of the annual that no injunction
can be procured, though they may be
subject to a suit for libel.
The Junior class held a meeting this
afternoon and considered the proposal
to make each junior stand an extra as
sessment of $2 apiece for the Blue and
Gold. The original assessment was $5,
for which each junior receives a Blue
and Gold. Gray's proposal to add $2 to
this assessment was rejected. The mat
ter of the Adams brothers' complaint
was not considered by the meeting of
the juniors.
The forthcoming Blue and Gold is re
puted to be full of sensational matter,
dealing with student life and faculty
affairs, and its appearance on the cam
pus to-morrow is awaited with interest
unusually keen.

HALFMOOX BAY. April 26. â ThÂ»
residents of this town ha.ye responded
enthusiastically to the appeal to pro

ing fires. Danger of a serious nre ;s
not remote and the citizens realize
that the expenditure of a compara

pany properly is money better spent
than in replacing burned structures.

cuss ways and means to improvÂ» the
flre fighting service was well attended
by men whose presence means co
operation in Th^ campaign. Chief
Simmons of the fire department pre
sided and A. F. Joseph acted as sec
retary. ThÂ«Â» immediate need of pro
viding more hydrants and of repairing
those now in service was pointed out
and recognized.
William Nelson. Charles Barden and
W. H. Griffith were appointed to so
licit funds to buy the necessary hy
drants, which will be put in place by
the firemen when they arrive. This
done, other measures will be taican
to improve the service.

IMPROVED CITY POLITICS.
TH; of the Republican League of San Francisco are
increasing:, and its membership and influence are extending. As
or, the need of improvement in city politics is em-
I by almost daily events. Men were not aware of the rapid
nd deterioration that had taken place here until the
Merchants' Association and the Grand Jury lifted the lid and ex-
I rendition of things in the city government and politics that
Â«ld have made a spectacle for Asmodeus. As the exposure and
o it extend the determination to apply a corrective vig
rises. Unless this is done what is now bad will grow worse,
it h grows worse its correction will become more difficult.
The league intends to take things in the green stick and cor
â¢ then while reform is easily possible. It has the power to scan
its own membership, and prevent its ranks from receiving recruits
â¢ r ; to disorganize it, and defeat its purpose. It will re
as it began, the scrutinizing body of the party, with the
I a of producing a city ticket that will command the support
that earnest majority of our people who, regardless of party,
-ire to make it the boast of every San Franciscan that he belongs
to no mean city, but to one that has the best and cleanest, most
economical and useful municipal government in the Union.
The city has never entirely outlived the ante-vigilance com
â¢tep reputation that was given its government by that high
- led official combination of political thugs, which made its gov
ernment a den of thieves. While we have had good administrations
since, and periods of honest and high-minded local government,
tn have been enough lapses to lay us open to suspicion and crit
icism. Now it is determined by the league, once for all, to band the
g ">od citizenship of the city together to put the political reputation
Sao Francisco on a par with her high character for enterprise,
>gress and prosperity.
Nor will this movement stop with a political reform of which
' city government is the object. Events of the most pointed
character call for extension of that reform to every political action
:ch is influenced by the large vote of San Francisco. The league
D not stop with 4 securing a decent city convention and ticket. It
will be its duty to see that a decent delegation goes to all party
conventions from this city. Our delegation by reason of its num
bers holds the balance of power in State conventions, and that
great and commanding position should be used to cleanly ends in
ate politics. All this comes after the city i? swept out and made
clean. After the last grafter has been amputated from his graft,
and after the citizens are safe from official blackmailing persecution,
and the taxpayers are assured of one hundred cents' worth of good
ernment for even- dollar they pay into the city treasury, after
â t it will be the business of the awakened conscience of San Fran
co to see to it that proper men are sent to represent our com
crce and all of our interests in the Legislature.
A State Senator from this city is on trial for bribery in the
Superior Court of Sacramento. That spectacle atone is enough to
IBM San Francisco. But when added to it is the Senator's
meanor and language on the stand as a witness in his own behalf,
every decent man winces and wonders how it came about that such
a man was chosen to represent a San Francisco constituency in the
ste Senate. We have not even the satisfaction that Kern County
may feel in her accused Senator, that after all, while he was crooked,
he had the talent, education and training that fitted him to be a
Senator, and if unto these he had added honor and uprightness, his
county could have felt proud of him. Our culprit shows no single
ality that belongs to the official station into which he was lifted
by our debased politics. Some one has said that laws are like
sausages â the less you know about how they are made the more
: respect them. But surely this city can send such lawmakers,
by reform of its politics, that we may know how they make the
laws and respect the statutes because we have that knowledge.
The time has come to rouse the people to an effort for the moral
welfare of the community. If the material welfare of any part of the
Me be in peril, how quickly every resource is invoked! If fruit
attack the orchards and vineyards, every business man in the
â  reads with intense interest the reports of the progress of the
ague and of the efforts to arrest it. Just now it is reported that
the dreaded Hessian fly is in the wheat, and merchants discuss it in
their stores, banks and clubs. We beg to assure them all that the
a! condition of San Francisco concerns them as much or
Te. The political plant louse, thrip. codling moth, scale and
Hessian fly are all at large here. No spray nor drug can eradicate
them. Only an awakening of civic vigilance and spirit can drive
the pests out of the city.
Let every man who wants to do this register now, not to-mor
row nor next week, but now. in order that he may vote at the
August primary. Then, on the day of that election, let every man
leave his business for part of the time or all of it and do duty by
.tfding guard at the polls. The grafters and the push will be
there. The prosperity of their business depends on their presence
snd activity at the primary. Let their force be met by a greater
force, representing the roused civic spirit of San Francisco, and the
Republican League will prevail.
THE MYSTIC SWINDLE.
'TPHE law ought to lay a hard hand upon the seers and mediums
I who make traffic lay of the hand upon the seers credulous. A
who make traffic out of the grief or greed of the credulous. A
very common form of the mystic swindle is worked upon i
mourners who are in sorrow for the dead. In many cases grief is
nursed until it becomes abnormal by not being permitted to receive
the healing influence of time. People who suffer in that way seem j
prone to seek out the frauds who pose as seers and materializes, to
whom they fall ready victims. /
There is another class of erotic old men who are the prey of
these swindlers. One rich old fool in Chicago a few years ago
was led by a medium into a courtship with the spirit of Martin
Luther's wife. Frau Luther had a sumptuous taste for diamonds ,
End silk dresses, which the old fellow bought and sent to her via
the medium. After he had spent $100,000 in this way, all being
absorbed by the medium of course, he was spiritually married to
his disembodied inamorata, and then his children managed to catch
him while he was on his honeymoon. If he had remained at large
until he went to housekeeping, the medium would have secured the
rest of his fortune. y
Hardly a week passes in San Francisco, or any other large
city, without a mystic swindle being perpetrated. Within a few
days a lady, mourning the death of her father, resorted to one of '
these swindlers in Oakland for the purpose of getting in commu
nication with her dead parent. The medium found it necessary to
have possession of the mourning woman's diamonds and jewelry to
the value of $700 - for purposes of identification and to '- assure the
father'? spirit that everything was in good faith. As soon as the
jewels were passed over the medium disappeared, ; and had not ma
terialized at JÂ«i>t recounts. . v
Those who mourn the dead should heed the example" of David's
noble sorrow and philosophy at the death of his child, when he rose
and put off sackcloth and ashes and ate, saying, "I may go to him,
but he cannot return to me."

THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, THHKSnAY. APKTI, 27, 1008.
A CRITICAL SITUATION
CAN HE GET IT DOWN WITHOUT HURTING THE BOY?
STRANGE BETS ON WAR'S RESULTS
AN Odessa paper published early
in July details of the reckless
wager of Captain Ilinsky. a St.
Petersburg dragoon officer. Ilinsky un
dertook to cross Asia, reach Kuropat
kin's headquarters at Liaoyang, dash
through the Japanese lines invading
Port Arthur, enter the town, break
through the naval brigade and reach
Chefu. in China. He was to get $50,
000 if he succeeded, but to pay noth
ing (save, perchance, his life) if he
failed.
Ilinsky succeeded. Disguised as a
Chinaman. he sauntered calmly
through the Japanese army in broad
daylight. The Russian forts fired on
him, but on his waving the national
flag (which he had wrapped around his
body) they welcomed him to the fort
ress. Three nights later, carrying
dispatches from Stoessel to prove that
he had succeeded, he sailed through
the Japanese fleet and reached Chefu.
The Journey took him six weeks.
After risking his life Ilinsky never got
his money. When, within three
months after starting, he returned to
St. Petersburg he found the layer of
the $50,000 a bankrupt.
More tragic was the result of a
Japanese bet recorded in the Vied
mosti. A captive Japanese officer, im
prisoned at Omsk, in Siberia, bet the
Russian officer in charge of the pris
oners a kopeck for every minute that
Port Arthur held out after June 1.
This entailed a liability of about $7 50
a day. The Jap owed his jailer on
October 1 nearly $1000. The Russian
asked for a payment on account and
offered to terminate the bet. The
Japanese said nothing, retired to his
room and shot himself dead with a
revolver.
A member of the English Club at
Moscow made a bet with a fellow
clubman that the Czar's troops would
win a victory within a week of the
birth of an heir to the throne. The
birth came off, but was not followed
by the victory, and $35,000 changed
hands.
A correspondent of the Frankfur
ter Zeitung declared that the patriotic
Japanese were so determined to die
for their country* that some officers
made bets that they would be killed

in battle. The money was to go to
their widows. ,
"An 'officer named Motono," says
the correspondent, "on starting for
the front in May made the following
wager: If he was killed within a
month his heirs were to receive 1000
yen ($500). After that date he was
to pay his opponent ten yen a day until
he had survived 100 days, after which
the bet was to cease. Motono under
took to expose himself to danger only
when military conditions demanded it;
in other words, not willfullyto let him
self be killed."
A Lyons paper records the queer
war bet of M. Oulseau, a local resi
dent. This gentleman undertook to
march three times around the town,
carrying a Japanese flag and shouting,
"Vive le Japonl" if Kuropatkin had
"not defeated Oyama by August 25. A3
the French are strongly pro-Russian,
this was considered a severe penalty.
The bet was lost, but as nothing was
said about the time of the march, M.
Ouiseau performed it at 3 o'clock in
the morning, when there was no one
about except a few policemen, who
took him for a madman.
A patriotic Russian named Lomakln,
according to the Moscow papers,
evaded the consequences of an un
pleasant bet by similar ingenuity. In
a moment of excitement Lamokin un
dertook to "eat his boots" if Japan
were not forced to sue for peace by
July 1 last. Against this his opponent
bet 500 rubles. Lomakin ate the
boots. But as no time limit was im
posed, he cut off and swallowed only a
tiny strip each day. completing the
achievement on November 20. His op
ponent absolved him from eating the
nails.
The Moscow fund for supplying
warm clothing to the troops organized
a sweepstake on the relief of Port
Arthur. A hundred tickets, dating
consecutively from June 1 were issued,
each costing $50. The holder of the
ticket bearing the date of Port Arthur's
relief was to receive $2600, re
maining $2600 to go to the fund, taj
Port Arthur was not relieved within
100 days, the prise was not awarded,
and the holders of the tickets agreed
to forego their claims.

Knowles, that Japan would anner all

Cragin states In his communication
tha.t investigation will show that this

and economy of construction and with
100.000.000 of gallons daily supply of

The watershed has an area of more than 200

More Than One-Half of the

Special DlsDat'-h to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 26.â David Be
lasco. the playwright, has succeeded
partly, at least, in getting information
from the books of the theatrical syndi
catf showing some of the profits which
his rivals. Klaw & Erlanger, received
from "The Auctioneer."
Numerous books were produced to
day before Judge Fitzgerald in the
Supreme Court, at the conclusion of
the suit instituted by Belasoo against
Joseph Brooks for an accounting of
the profits of "The Auctioneer" and
when some of the details of the profits
were disclosed, Belasco seemed greatly
pleased.
It was disclosed that the books show
the profits of the syndicate from the
theaters, but when questioned as to
the profits of the "Auctioneer," Walk
er said it was impossible for him to
i^tate them. He showed, in the case
of the Harlem Opera-house, where the
Warfield production appeared, that the
receipts for one week amounted to
$10,892. Sixty per cent wen to Belas
oo and Brooks, the latter having testi
fied that the gave to Klaw & Erlanger
two-thirds of his share and $3320 net
profits went to the opera-house.
Klaw & Erlanger receive thirty-three
and one-third per cent of all syndicate
profits, but Walker could not tell what
proportion of the $3320 was received
by the syndicate.
The books disclose that during the
season of 1902 the net profits of the
syndicate from the various theaters
controlled by Klaw & Erlanger
amounted $227,500. Walker was asked
by Untermayer to state what propor
tion of this sum Klaw & Erlanger re
ceived and he replied, $127,500.

for Europe to-day on the White Star liner Bal
tic. They propose to spend the summer at

Carnegie vu asked if he would say something
regarding the agitation about "tainted"
money.
""No," he replied, laughingly. "I am hardly
in a position to discuss the subject. I never
give money where I think that It will not be
accepted. I believe that money given in any
good cause will do good and bring about good
results, even though thÂ« source may be con
sidered "tainted" by some."

to the Bridges and Fills
GALLUP, N. M., April 26.â Late this
afternoon word was received from Su
perintendent Gibson that the washout
on the Santa Fe between Grants and
Horace had been repaired and the total
blockade of through trains, which has
existed since last Sunday afternoon, is
over. The five coast trains, which had
been laid up here, were started east
this evening in four sections, fifteen
minutes apart. California Limited No.
A, which left Los Angeles at 6 o'clock
Sunday evening, was the first train to
go out on the newly repaired road, car
rying all the mails from the other coast
trains. The remaining four trains were
consolidated Into three sections and
forwarded as rapidly as possible.
TRINIDAD, Cola, April 26.â The Las
Animas River reached its highest mark
here at 6 o'clock to-night. At that
hour the south approach to the Rio
Grande Railroad bridge dropped into
the river. Railroad rails were thrown
into the river to keep the wrecked por
tion of the bridge from washing away,
but the force of the flood is so strong
that It may be washed away at any
moment. The store of the Colorado
Supply Company has been flooded and
an army of men is engaged in remov
ing the goods. The company has suf
fered considerable damage, which can
not be estimated at this time. The
river is gradually washing away the
new Santa Fe fill despite the fact that
hundreds of men are at work dumping
trainloads of rock into the river bed in
order to change the channel.
A temporary water supply was fur
nished the business portion of the city
to-day by laying a water main across
the Rio Grande bridge. The wrecking
at this bridge makes it extremely un
certain when a water supply can be
had again. All westbound Santa Fe
trains are held up here on account of
the washout near Starkville, ftve miles
south of here. Seven heavily loaded
passenger trains are stalled, including
two specials bearing United States sol
diers from Medicine Barracks, near Al
legheny, Pa., Arsenal and Fort
Thomas, Ky., to the Philippines.
OKLAHOMA CITY, O. T.. April 26.â
The flood waters of the South Cana
dian River reached Oklahoma during
last night, and carried out a portion of
the Frisco bridge at Fay. During the
day the flood reached the Rock "Island
main line and carried away fifty feet of
the railway bridge at Mlnco. Trains
are being detoured over the Santa Fe.
The Frisco bridge over the river at
Mustang, south of this city, is threat
ened. The river Is still rising.

FALT LAKE. April 28.â Four thousand dol

IN THE TANKS
Multi-Millionaire Laughlin
of Pittsburgh Mistaken
for a Common Marauder
EIDES IN PATROL WAGON
Too-Energetic Detective Ar
rests the Steel Magnate on
His Own Private Grounds
Special Dispatch to The CalL
PITTSBURG, April 26.â James B.
Laughlin, treasurer of the Jones &
Laughlin Steel Company, a prominent
society and club man and at least a
five-time millionaire, was arrested early
this morning, as he was about to en
ter his palatial home at Center avenue
and Neville street, by Philip Rimllng
er, a detective, who failed to recognize
him and supposed he was a burglar.
In spite of Laughlin's protestations
and his efforts to prove his identity,
he' was taken to the police station, a
mile distant, in a patrol wagon and
locked up In a cell with a pickpocket
and a common drunk, where he was
compelled to remain until this morn
ing. During his incarceration Laugh-
Hn offered to write his personal check
for any amount up to $100,000 and de
posit it for his appearance, but he was
only laughed at by the sergeant.
Last night Laughlin drove to the
Duquesne Club, where he was delayed
until after midnight, when he started
for home in his carriage. Several
acres of ground surround Laughlin's
home and he alighted from his car
riage at the corner of Neville streÂ«t
and Center Avenue, Intending to walk
down to the gate and thence through
the grounds to the house.
Just as he reached the ffate of his
house Laughlin was accosted by Rim
linger, who demanded to know where
he was going. Laughlin replied that it
was none of Rlmlinger's business,
whereupon the officer seized him by
the collar and told him he was under
arrest. Laughlin tried to explain and
told the officer that he was the owner
ot the place. He said that if the de
tective would accompany him to the
door he would prove his identity. But
all the satisfaction that the millionaire
got waa that he could explain that to
the sergeant. He was then taken in
a patrol wagon to the station, where
the sergeant ordered him locked up In
a cell, denying him the use of the tele
phone or other means of communicat
ing with his friends.
This morning Laughlin was taken
before Justice Negley, charged with
being a suspicious person and with
disorderly conduct after having been
placed under arrest. After the magis
trate heard the evidence he discharged
the millionaire.

It has been the custom for men to ob

later secure clerical work, which is a
violation of the civil service regula

It loofca as though I'nole were due to
be a headllner in the baseball proces
sion once again. His Seals took the
Commuters all the way along the route
yesterday afternoon at Recreation
Pajtk. playing good enough baseball to
win most any kind of a game. It was
all the easier considering the fact that
Oakland could never sneak in a hit
that counted. Score, San Francisco
8, Oakland v.
Jimmy Whal^n did the work once
afain. He was the real shutout kid
and Oakland never had a chance. All
batters looked alike to him and he just
stood on the slab and mixed >m up.
Nobody could touch him. though they
â were all swinging their heads off.
From the manner in which the Seals
clouted the ball, they really had no
license to bring three runs over. Er
rors figured strongly. The Commuters
were disheartened because they could
not hang the offerings of the Whaie
and Then they began to pile up miscues
just to get even on somebody. They
were bad In the Fixth spasm when the
Seals were thÂ«*re with a pair of aces.
Francks was the chief offender in
'his round. He booted a ball hit to
him by Hildebrand and then threw it
away at second trying to head off
Walters. Both men advanced on the
play and both scored. Irwin brought
the last run in with a sizzler that
went all the way out to deep center
field.
Three double plays helped the Oak
. landers out some and they all came
easy. Jimmy Whalen hit Into the first
one with a pair of men on the paths in
the second spasm. Kelly and Streib
figured In the second, while Streib
made the last one unassisted on a fly
from Murphy's bat, catching Hilde
brand about a foot off the bag. The

to-day and pounded them to their
hearts', content. Portland's unlucky
streak was still in evidence, for not
withstanding the fact that Cates suf
fered only one more hit than Fitzger
ald, Tacoma was the more fortunate
in bunching their hits and consequent
ly in piling up runs. Eagan, Tacoma's
shortstop, knocked a home run to left
field In the fifth, scoring three run

WESTERN BOWLERS ORGANIZE
A CONGRESS AT SPOKANE
A. W. Martin of This City Is elected
.President of the Independent
' c Association. A
VpOKANE, April Twenty-five delegates,
representing five cities of the Pacific North
âPortland, Seattle, , Tacoma, Salt Lake
and Spokane â have organized the Western
Bowling Congress. A motion was made by A.
W. Harrison of Portland that the congress be
organized entirely independent of the Ameri
can Howling Congress. W. 8. Zehring of Salt
Lake amended the motion to the effect that
the present rules and ( regulations of the
American Bowling Congress, which are older
and longer tested, be adopted by the Western
Congress. This leaves the Western bowlers
to decide at the business meeting to-morrow
whether they will adopt the new rules of the
American Congress relative to the weight of
the ball and the square gutter. There is much
opposition manifest to the new American Con
gress ruling, and It is probable it will not be
accepted by the Western Congress.
. A. W. Martin of San Francisco was elected
president of the congress. Other officers elect
ed were: A. W. Williamson of Portland, first
vice president: W. S. Zehrlng of Salt Lake,
second vice president; A. L. Jenkins of Seattle,
secretary ; A: H. Harrison, Seattle, treasurer;
executive committee â E. H. Rothrock, Spo
kane; M. .1. Sheehan. Butte; Charles Tletje,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY. APRIL 27. 1005.
DR. LEGGO BIDS FAREWELL
Great Three- Year-Old Wins
Last Kace on Card at
Oakland.
KENTUCKY DERBY NEXT
Allopath and Follow Me Fin
ish in Front Quoted at
Long Odds.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
On the eve of his departure for Ken
tucky, the land of pigtails and hominy,
blue grass and sour mash whisky, Dr.
Leggo, the phenomenal son of Puryear
D and Sevens, kissed himself away by
winning the last selection on the menu
yesterday at Oakland.
The bookmakers figured that much
long-distance racing had dulled the
speed of the crack three-year-old and
laid 4 to 5 against his chances, the
route being but six furlongs.
Far out of the running during the
first part of the race, the Doctor re
sponded to Toornan's urging and, from
the three-furlong pole, grabbed up one
after another of the leaders as the
steel trust does its rivals.
DR. LEGGO SCORES HAXDIIiY,
At the wire he won, hands down, in
l:l3Vi from Albert Fir and Salable.
The winner received an ovation when
Tooman returned to the stand.
Favorites v. ere returned first on but
two occasions. Fine weather attracted
another large crowd.
Father Catchem, the Stubenbord en
try, was heavily played at a scant
quotation to win the two-year-old dash
at four and a half furlongs. Jakie
Jones had the leg up. and, in a hard
drive, led out Sir Edward by less than
a length. El Dinero, the Baldwin colt,
ran a close third.
Next came a one and a quarter mile
selling affair, catch-as-catch-can rules
to govern, with a field of thirteen
starting. Lloyd Fountain on .Allo
path, a 12 to 1 shot, did a spectacu
lar slide for life, landing first at the
wire, a neck in front of Byronerdale,
one of the Dost choices. The show
went to Inviotus. thereby maintaining
Ascot Park form. Both Expedient and
Iras ran disgraceful races.
HUGH McGOWAN" FINISHES FIRST
"Cricket" Kelly took the mile and
a furlong run with Hugh McGowan,
second choice in the ring. Ocyrohe
made all the running until well into
the stretch. Then Kelly made his
move with Hugh McGowan and the
Rowell horse galloped in. Stilicho,
the favorite, finished third.
Quite a killing was made over the
victory of Follow Me, which captured
the fourth event, a six-furlong run,
backed from 30 down to 12. El Chi
huahua, with Tooman up, had first
call in the betting and in a drive at
the wire lost to the outsider by half
a length. The show went to Light of
Day.
What caused Cerro Santa to be in
stalled favorite for the split of the
six-furlong number is a mystery. The
gelding went to the post a 2 to 1
chance, with Boaeman in the saddle,
and ran unplaced. The odds about
Toupee receded to fours, and, well
ridden by Frank Sullivan, the little
fellow downed Sincerity Belle and Bell
Reed handily.
TRACK NOTES.

rode Follow Me. bred and raced Sil

BUNKERS' TRIAL
NEARLY ENDED
SACRAMENTO. April 26. â When
the trial of Harry Bunkers, the for
mer State Senator, accused of bribery,
was called this morning in Judge
Harts department of the Superior
Court the prosecution placed J. O.
Joints of Alameda, J. A. Vaughn of
Oakland and Morris Davis upon the
Btand to testify as to the reputation of
Henry Hartling, a detective, for truth
nnd veracity. They said his reputa
tion was good.
Former Judge James G. Maguire of
San Francisco and Sheriff Sibley of
San Joaquin were present to answer
to the good reputation of Detective
George N. Tichenor, but they were not
called, the defense announcing that
Tichenor's character was not to be at
tacked.
F. E. Johnston of Napa and George
T. Wright of San Francisco testified
to Hartling's reputation for veracity
and truth being good.
Joseph Jordan was recalled and de
nied that he ever arranged with Bunk
ers for an automobile ride, or met
him, as he says, to take such a ride.
Charles T. Jones then argued the
case for the people.
The trial will be resumed to-day.

Captain Shea, will be in command of the
Dauntless. During her comparatively short
<Â«reer the Dauntless .-.Â»â  done a great deal of
ocean towing. On some of her trips she has
terrific storms, but in high seas
->r calms ehe has plugged along with h*r tow.
Not a nyshap ts marked tip against her and
to her credit re a number of new long-dis
tance records, which IN likely to stand un
broken for many daye.
The Dauntless eiready has towed the Monte
rey many miles, but thU la the. first tUnÂ»
either the Dauntless cr anything of hÂ«r claas
has tackled an ocean voyage of this length
w-ith a heaviry laden vessel towing behind. It
'â¢â¢ for vcyage* like this, however, that the
Dauntless is peculiarly fitted and when the
boaif return it Is more than likely that there
will be another new record established.
Superintendent Wlllism Wanning was In
Monterey yesterday and will see the Dauntless
Ft&rte<l on her long trip.' The Dauntless Is an
oil burner and In b*r tanks carries enough
liquid fuel to ron her at a ten-knot gait for
thirty d&yt.
Ttf Monterey has on board 16.000 barrels of
oil for the Matron Navigation Company's de
pot at the Hawaiian sort.
Coptic LÂ«avÂ«?s Honolulu.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's liner Coptic. Captain Finch, left
Honolulu for this port at 1 o'clock a. m. yes
terday. It was reported that a case of small
pox had been discovered on the liner, but the
steamship company has received no advices
to ttmi effect. Under any circumstances there
is not likely to be any delay In quarantine at
this port. If such a case did develop, the
linr-r was fumigated thorough!?' at Honolulu.
Dr. Gate*, f>urgeon of the Coptic, is a man
of good Judgment and some time ago when
on the Gaelic, .saved that vessel a long de
tection in quarantine by the effective manner
In which he handled a case of contagious sick
ness. The quarantine officials at this port
have creat confidence in Surgeon Gates and
Co not antic!xÂ»ate having to be unkind to the
Coptic when she gets here.

What is wanted of soap
for the skin is to wash it
clean and not hurt it.

NEW YORK. April 26. â Speculative senti
**nÂ«st in- r!tÂ«-*tock murket xmf d be swayed
et present slmoet entirely try the rvarylng
f.iFfip repardinp the relations between railroad I
crpitalists who control the Northwestern rail- â 
"Toad systems. To-day's rumors shifted to
the. side of prevailing harmony and a dis
position to <--o-oiÂ«erat.e for mutual advantage.
Out of this there has been built up
â  during the recent, boom in stocks a complf
cetfd system of supposed projects for cen
tralization of control of tlte railroad systems '
01 practically the whole country. The Â«iuni].
in Northern Securities stocks shook the con
fidÂ«-nr<e in these stories and during the break
of this-- week and last opinion has veered to
the .-i her eitreme. Instead of harmony whip- I
'X>f-rt of *Â«ar and of r>!ans of mutual destruc- '
tior. have rrf>naded the street. The reports of
â¢ret-tcred karxnonv to-day came after the move
n-.cnts- -of fcjl(X.ks and there was suspicion that
manipulative process played a large part in
the prioe movement. The downward plunge in
. the price of Northern Securities was in a
large part due to the fear that with the re- ;
lease of the fclocks uf its constituent companies :
they would he freely liquidated on account of ;
the high level to which the nominal quotations
had Ij^en- carried .while the holdings were tied j
â¢up, in thf. Northern Securities Company. This !
*! pre *-.Â»â¢"!!â  ion was kept alive by the vio'ent de- j
.Â«. lines ir. the quotations for these stocks. But i
there wag a.n awakening to-day to the fa-*t
that the volurr.e of offerings on which these
dÂ»ciirÂ»>s had been made was almost purely
nrir.'nfcl -in spite of -the rapid distribution be
lnK effected of eertincates of stocks of these
â  ".mpzniesi. It was reasoned from this that
the concentrated holdings of Northern Pacific
fcr.d' 4j r r-at Northern probably were little
changed and that they were not comine on
.tiie market in large quantities. A rumor wa*
*et afl'.at in. addition that an agreement had
be*>n reached as to the. disposition to be made
01 Northern Pacific. It was alleged In ad
dition that the controlling interest in Union
"Pacific had averted a danger which menaced !
them of losing control of their property and
that the. proposed Issue of $100,000,000 of
j-'rt-f erred â¢ vtock would be abandoned, as It
fra.4 lieen intended only to preserve that con
jrol. There was a considerable outstanding
â¢â hcrt- interest which was alarmed I by these
developments. ThÂ«? effect was clearly man
iif-st 3n The mcvemerts 1n -Northern Securities,
Great Northern preferred. Northern Pacific,
"Cnlc'i Pacific, St. Paul. -Northwestern,
riihois ' Central and New York Cen
tral, all of which have been bound up
tÂ«jrether more or less in the speculation .tiased
on this topic. Very explicit declarations were
rr.ac> also that the long rumored lease by a ,
dividend guarantee of Louisville and Nash
vilfe to the Atlantic Coast line had been
'â¢definitely determined upon. Amalgamated Cop
per led a strong group of copper, lead and
pmeltlrg rtoefcs.' a special influence being th*
increase in ' the dividend rate on Anaconda, a
***Ã¼bsi;!iary company of the Amalgamated. The
.Vnited States Steel * stocks at first reflected
disappointment on the part of speculators who
hud -counted on larger net earnings for the
quarter than were reported at the meeting
e'ter the market had closed yesterday. But
# tf-ejpe 1 * B*o<-kg showed a rood recovery when
the Teneral strength developed. The vagaries
of- th*" price movement aroused growing sus
picion , especially the feverish fluctuations in
â¢Louisville and Nashville and the sudden sub
f'denc* at intervals of the active buying
movement. The market bad already become
' shaky when the new* was published of thÂ« !
declaration of only the regular dividend on
Norfolk and Western. There has been n
tenrlVe speculation based on hopes of an in
crease snd â¢he unloading of disappointed hold
ers carried - that stock 3 points under lajit
r.iftht and broke the wbo> market- Th' clos

The circular of Somers' & Co. says of Hay: '
"In spite of the diminution in shipments of '
Hay, which show, but 2*00 tons for the past
week ; in â  comparison : with 2720 tons for the :
week preceding, .we can report no improvement â 
in | the * local ' situation. Holders are still â¢ en
deavoring to maintain the market as best they J
can. but it is generally conceded that at the
present range of prices losses are being made >
on every sale of Hay which was purchased !
during last harvest season. , It Is the belief'
of many that the â  coming crop â¢ will turn out *
rather poor in quality: because of this belief
some holders have determined to carry over j
their good quality stock until next season. This
may result in a somewhat steadier market next I
month. In any event, we think that prices :
have â  reached bedrock and that even . with the
advent of a new crop no lower prices than the j
present - range will â  be â¢ noted. - . â  . j
â¢ "The United States Department of Agricul- :
ture reports excellent prospects throughout the |
entire State,' â¢ although it is generally believed '
that wherever possible grain will be made. Al- |
though prospects are rather favorable for con- !
sumers in the way of . low prices, yet after
all we may see fairly good returns for Hay i
throughout t the entire year."

WOMEN DRIVEN
TO HYSTERICS
The case for the ! prosecution In the
trial of Michael J. McCarthy, charged
with the murder of " his wife, Octavia,
j before a jury in Judge ; Cook's court,
; was closed yesterday morning before
'â¢â  the noon adjournment, but several wit
i nesses may be called In rebuttal. An
, effort was made to shut out the dying
i statement made by the woman, . but it
! was not successful. .
While Attorney Reese Clark was
making' his opening statement for the
I defense and r referring in strong and
j unflattering terms to the. character of
j the dead woman, there occurred an ex
\ citing scene. Miss Maggie McCarthy
I and Mrs W. King, sisters of the defend
| ant. had to be led from the court as
\ they were -in a hysterical condition
I and outside the courtroom Miss Mc
| Carthy fainted. Then Mrs. Elizabeth
Sloat, mother, and Mrs. Ovita Hawes,
sister of the murdered woman, became
hysterical and they also had to be led
out. = â 
The defense will depend upon â¢ the
previous ; ; character of - Mrs. McCarthy,
| the . assertion .-' that the shooting was
J accidental and that death ; was due
I chiefly to malpractice while Mrs. Mc
! Carthy was a patient -at the Central
! Emergency I' Hospital. ; Clark ' was
: checked by Assistant District â  Attorney
I Ashe r--, for r referring '< to Mrs. Ovita
* Hawes as"that." . â¢ â '. â¢â¢'. :/ ,-â *'
'. Dr. J. M. Toner was the first witness
examined for the defense. ; Hypotheti
cal questions were put to him and he
answered generally that if v a wound
; is not properly : drained ', poison would
I set in; and spread through the ; system,
| leading to death. He thought : that a
gunshot wound such as Mrs. McCarthy
received might cause death.

PURSE DISAPPEARS WHILE
PURSER DANCES TWO=STEP
He Accuses Male Partner of the Robbery
Incident Occurs in Saloon Where Victim
Was Accompanied by Young Woman.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
It was the Jangling melody emanat
ing from an automatic piano that at
tracted N. E. Weed to the O'Farrell-
Btreet saloon managed by W. L. Can
stantine. Mr. Weed is a steamship's
purser ax\&, like most men of the sea,
dearly loves both music and dancing.
Therefore when his ears were assailed
by the seductive strains of a two-step
he halted his lady companion, Miss
Alice Rice, and persuaded her to ac-
company him to its source. When they
entered the hafroom, however, MIeJ
Kice coyly declined to trir> a measure
with him. her whispered excuse being
that she could net think of doing such
a thing at su< h a time in such a place.
But for Mr. Weed there was no resist
ing that crashing allurement. His
feet tingrled and his knees involuntar
ily twitched unii'.. Incapable of fur
ther self-restraint, he grabbed Mr,
Constantine and swttns him in lieu of
a gentler partner. They danced and
danced until Mr. Weed was surfeited
with the exercise and promenaded to
the bar, where he discovered that from
a rear pocket of his pantaloons a purse
containing $25 had been surreptitious
ly extracted. Mr. Constantint indig
nantly denied cognizance of the theft,
but Mr. Weed caused his arrest and
charged him v.ith larceny.
In the court of Poiice Judge Conlan
there ,was no response from Miss Rice
when her name was called and as the
prosecution could not make much
headway without her testimony a con
tinuance until to-day was asked for
and granted. Mr. Weed, who dwells
at 610 Geary street, declared that his
confidence in Miss Rice's integrity was
?o strong that nothing less convincing
than her confession could make him
even suspect her of the robbery. As
fon the purse dropping out of his
pocket and being picked up by some
dishonest person while he and Mr.
Constantine danced. Mr. Weed pro
nounced the Idea too preposterous for
his serious consideration. In the j
meantime Mr. Constantine's original j
plea of innocence of the pilfering and
ignorance of the plunder's whereabouts
remain* unshaken.
Joe Murphy, heavily whiskered and
generally unkempt, was nestling amid
flowers in Union Square and hurling
anathemas at the towering St Francis
Hotel when Patrolmen Riehl and Proll
stopped his profane soliloquy, dragged
him from the spot and booked him for
drunkenness in a public place. In the
court of Judge Fritz he declared that
hia detestation of lofty structures was
inherent and ineradicable, but never
found audible expression until he
drank to excess. So abhorrent were
tall buildings to him that he seldom or
never slept in one, preferring to slum
ber out o' doors tp entering any house
exceeding one sfory in height. Then
the Judge informed him that by ex
plaining his peculiar aversion when he

Jail, where he is to spend the next ten

Louis L. Bibiscu. minus half of one |
ear, was arrested for disturbing the i
peace on Howard street, between Sixth
and Seventh, but Judge Cabaniss diÃ-'
missed him after he had explained that
ho was provoked to violent utterance
by the taunts launched at him by a
rival in the Second-hand furniture
business.
The mutilation of Mr. Bibiscu's
auricular organ was performed about
a year ago by the teeth of a Japanese
restaurateur, wh^m he had offended
by criticizing the quality of certain j
viands served. "This meat," he said,
after vainly endeavoring to insert mfc
incisors in a beefsteak, "is tougher
than .ill-get-out." Whereupon his ear
was seized between the molars of the
little brown caterer, who apparently
found his mouthful quite tender, for
without^/Hfnculty he nipped off a lobe.

"Well, your face is familiar, but
"Ye can't think of me name. That's

VERDICT RESTS
ON PUBLICATION
Attorneys for Florence M.
Boyere Seek to Prove That
She Was Not Responsible
COURT WARNS LAWYERS
Bitter Flings Result in Ad
monition That They Con
duct Themselves Properly
Attorney William F. Hanlon battled
, all day yesterday to maintain that
I the removal from the office of the
j County Clerk of papers in ' the
j case of Whittel vs. Boyere was not
â  responsible for tWe discovery of the ro
| mance in which thÂ« young people were
i principals. After much argument on
the point Hanlon was placed on the
stand by Miss Boyere's counsel and
apkei â¢ <s-.irrlinir the removal â of the
; par. rs in the case. He said he took the
i paper? liom the office of the County
| Clei k under authorization of the court.
I All Cf i his was brought out in an ef
j fort to ihow that it was Hanlon's acts
, that caused the publication of the facts
I ct the Whittell-Boyere affair, and that
| hence he has no right at this time to
j repudiate the agreement to pay Miss
; noyere (fiOO in <?vent the story was kept
I from the public press.
The morring Fession was marked by
| a few bitter ilings of counsel, which
j called down upon them the warning
;cf the court that under no circum-'
, rtances would unlawyerlike conduct
ibe permitted. The first intimation of
: the feelins between counsel came when
Attorney T. I. Brown, representing Miss
Boyere. a?ked Attorney Owens, who
was on the stand, whether he, as
Miss Boyere's counsel during the trial
of the annullment suit, was a party to
ihe plan to seorctly remove the papers
in the case from the office of the Coun
ty Clerk to keep them from the press.
"I object," said Hanlon, springing
to his feet. 'The purpose of that ques
i tion Is to cast an aspersion upon
me. The matter of the removal of the
papers was thrnshed out before Judge
Troutt, and there is no need of offer
ing new offense to me." Judge Hunt
; sustained the objection.
Attorney Owens continued his tes
timony, and said that prior to the
signing of the agreement upon which
Miss Boyere is suing Attorney Han
lon it was understood that the agree
ment was to be void only in event she
herself gave the facts of her alleged
contract marriage to Whittell to the
prets.
i'lttorn^y H.in'i n f/illed to draw an
admission from him that it was umVr
stood thai the rOntr&ct was to be void
no matter how the faeta became iub
lic. in event they did. Owens main
taining that any conversation to that
effect took piaoe after the agreement
had been siynr-d and delivered and the
compact closed beyond amendment.
George Whittell Sr., father of the
alleged contract groom, was ne^t call
ed to the stand. He testified that he
placed 32500 to Hanlon's credit in the
Dorrohoe-Kelly Bank, $1000 of which
3um was drawn on November 5, 1903,
and paid to Mi3s Boyere. The $2500,
Whittell said, was to pay all expenses
of all the suits, as well as to pay the
demands of Miss Boyere. The figure
of settlement with Miss Boyere. he
said, was not ?2500; but this sum was
placed in Hanlon's hands for fear that
it might run to that amount. A por
tion of the money, he said, was ftill
in Hanlon's hands, a final accounting
of the cost of young Whittell s venture
matrimonial not yet having been made.
When Whittell left the stand Attor
ney Hanlon made a motion for a non
suit. He argued at length that the
plaintiff had not established a case and
that he should be dismissed with his
costs. The caurt granted a. nonsuit as
to#fche claim for money received, but
refused a nonsuit on the claim under
the contract.
It was thought the case would be
concluded yesterday morning, but the
argument of counsel occupied so
much time that a continuance until
this morning was necessary.

PAYING FIRST
VISIT TO CITY
Baron Alphonso Rothschild, heir
apparent to the millions of the Aus-'
trian branch of the Rothschild fam
ily, arrived here yesterday from the
south and is registered at the Palace
Hotel. The young nobleman said yes
terday that his visit to California is
with the hope that the Western cli
mate will improve his eyes, which are
weak from overwork, the result of
rigorous courses of instruction to
which he and his younger brother.
Baron Louis Rothschild, were subject- j
ed preparatory to entering upon a
commercial life.
"There is absolutely nothing signif
icant in my presence in San Francis
co," remarked the Baron yesterday.
shortly after his arrival. "I have just !
come from Mexico, where my brother j
and I spent a month in recreation. I
How long I shall remain here is a I
matter I have not yet decided. It is â 
my intention to go direct to New York
from San Francisco."
The arrival yesterday of the Baron i
gave rise to a report that he was here j
in the interest of his banking firm In '
Vienna, which, it was supposed, was
behind the recent deal in the United
Railroads, but this he emphatically I
denied, adding that his firm was not in
any way connected in the transfer of i
stock. He. however, declined to dis- i
cuss the affairs of his firm. The |
Rothschild family of Vienna is inter
ested in copper properties in Shasta '
County and Is also reported to have |
been the firm that agTeed to take over '
5000 shares of the stock of the Bank ;
of California, but of these matters the j
Baron refused to talk.
Barons Alphonso and Louis Roth- I
schild arrived in this country last No- !
vember under arrangement between ,
their family and J. Pierpont Morgan ;
to enter the banking offices of the lat
ter. Owing to the ill health of Al
phonso the two young noblemen, act- i
ing on the advice of their physician, j
later poceeded on a trip to Mexico to ,
enjoy what Baron Alphonso was yes
terday pleased to term the first long j
vacation in their rather strenuous
lives. Apparently the brothers have
not taken kindly to the proposed ap- (
prenticeship under J. Pierpont Mor
gan, for Baron Alphonso said yester
day that he and his brother had sep- i
arated in Mexico, the latter returning |
to New York, where they have agreed i
to meet in May and leave for Europe
in June.
