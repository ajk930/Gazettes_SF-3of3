Ing the town on three sides simultaneously and employing their whole forces, being determined to finish the business. Russian mines blew up whole battalions. General Fock especially distinguished
himself, directing the fire from the wall, which the Japanese reached after indescribable massacre. The whole of Admiral Togo's and Vice Admiral Kamimura's squadrons are aiding the struggle, which,
it is feared, will be final. The besieged forces are fighting as in a furnace. A perfect storm of shell is falling on the town, port and fortress from the hills and roadstead. General Stoessel is going
from fort to fort encouraging the defenders in their desperate efforts. In St. Petersburg the facts concerning the tragic events, which perhaps will terminate in a glorious fall of Port Arthur, are wholly
unknown. At court hope has not yet been entirely abandoned."
WITH APPALLING SLAUGHTER PORT ARTHUR RESISTS THE FINAL ASSAULT;
JAPANESE ATTACK BY LAND AND SEA AND THE STRONGHOLD SEEMS DOOMED
San Francisco people are not the only sufferers by the untimely and unexpected Septem
ber storm. From all parts of the State, Tvith the exception of the far south, comes word that
heavy shozi'crs of rain arc falling. In the fruit-raising sections much damage has been done,
particularly to the grape crop, and to the fruit spread out in the fields to dry.
The storm that swept over the city Thursday night and yesterday did thousands of dol
lars' ivorih of damage. For three hours last night a terrific thunder-storm raged. A bolt Â¦ of
lightning struck a telegraph pole at Fillmore and Bay streets, burning out all the zvires in the dis
trict. The hardware firm of Dunham, Cari'igan & Hayden lost $12,000 in a flooded basement.

General Sakharoff reports that the
Japanese army la moving from Bent

northeast of Mukden and near the
right bank of the Hun River. The
river at this point is shallow and prob
ably for this reason the locality has
been selected by the Japanese for
crossing." If the Japanese gain a foot
hold at Fu pass. General Kuropatkln's
position at Mukden will be insecure, as
the Japanese will thence be able to
threaten the Russian line of communi
cations. Fu pass is only twenty miles
north of Bentsiaputze. but at the pres
ent rate of progress the Japanese prob
ably will occupy four or five days in
traversing these twenty miles.
The Russian force south of Mukden
is believed to consist of only one army
corps, which Is acting as a rear-guard
and is not intended to offer serious re
sistance to the Japanese.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept- 24, 2:45 a.
m.â Absence of detailed reports from
the 3eat of war, despite the important
character of events that " are believed
to be developing around JJakden, leads
to the supposition that General Kuro
patkin, after all, may not seriously
contest the Japanese advance and the
long expected battle at Mukden may
turn out to be merely a rear-guard
action on a large scale.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 23.â In

year-oloff Margaret 5 " the child
of William -Stumpf, 1 a wealthy afreet
railway man and banker, was discov
ered to-day by the police in her
father's stable, where she had been
confined for five years. As a child her
mind had been weak and rather than
have her around the house her parents
had taken this means of putting her
out of the way.
None of the neighbors knew that the
Stumpfs had a daughter, so closely was
their secret guarded.
When the police entered the barn the
girl, entirely unclad, was seated on
the straw in one of the stalls. It was
explained by her father that she could
not be made to wear clothing.
During her long, solitary confinement
she had grown to the size of a mature
woman, but her hands and face are
abnormally small. She has completely
lost the power of conversation, and,
when she tries to talk, is only able to
utter unintelligible grunts. When the
police officers entered her prison to
day she greeted them with a loud cry,
like that of a wild animal.
Before she was placed in the prison
the girl was wont to amuse herself by
tearing her clothing from her back,
and, if permitted, would treat other
members of the family in the same
way. She wÂ«is taken in charge by the
police matron, who discovered that she
had no knowledge of how to feed her
self. V. 'ii::r ;

GAZELLE, Sept. 23.- -The fall of rain

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 23.â The grape
growers of this locality have suffered
a loss of thousands of dollars from the
present st $ orm. The grape season was
in its height when the rain began, but
r.ow all shipments to the East have
been stopped. Most of the grapes that
remain on the vines will be ruined, be
cause the moisture will cause decay as
soon as the grapes are picked. The
bean crop which was Just beginning to
be harvested has also suffered great
loss. The total rainfall for this storm
amounts to more than two Inches, the
greatest precipitation ever recorded fo-.
a September storm.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 23.â A
heavy rainfall in this county to-day re
sulted in much damage to crops, beans
in -particular suffering. The threshing
season has just opened, and thousands
of tons of beans are still in pod in the
fields.
In Santa Maria and Los Alamos dis

RAIN IS WELCOMED.
STOCKTON, Sept. 23.â The untimely
rain of last night and to-day has
caused a loss to the growers in this
county of fully $250,000. If the rain
should continue forty-eight hours, and
there seems a prospect that it will, the
loss will reach half a million dollars.
That statement is made by J. B. Me
loche, who is in close touch with the
condjtions. . Table , grapes and beans
suffer the. most, though onions are also
hurt considerably. The rain could '"not
have â¢ come , at- a worse;, time for; the
beans. 7 The 'effect will ,be to advance
prices fully 25- per cent on beans. Wine
grapes are not injured; on the contrary,
they* are benefited. The recent hot

increase the sugar to an undesirable
extent.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 23.â Up to 10:30 a.

hills the precipitation has been fully
twice as much. Reports indicate that
many wine and table grapes are hope
lessly damaged, and that many hun

will be a total loss. The bulk of the
crop, however, has been picked, and
where the trays were stacked the dam

FRESNO, Sept. 23.â The first show
ers of the season freshened things
about Fresno County to-day and this
evening. Rain has been pouring
steadily though not heavily. Many
seem glad to welcome the rain, but the
raisin growers who have their trays in
the field are down in the mouth. It
means the loss of many dollars. Plenty
of warnings was given by Weather
Bureau Observer Bolton, but some of
the ranchers delayed stacking their
trays till too late. Those still in the
field probably will be spoiled.

says, and the rainiest September day
in the history of the weather bureau.
Forecaster Willson gave the people a
clear morning for the Odd Fellows'
parade, but in the afternoon he again
let loose his showers. The rainfall
for the twenty-four hours preceding
5 o'clock last night was Z.V9 inches.
The rainiest day San Francisco has
known since 1850 was on December
19, 1866, when 7.76 inches of rain fell

terday morning the rainfall amouted
to 1.24 inches. From 12:35 to 12:45
yesterday morning nearly a third of
an inch of rain fell. The exact meas
urement was .32 of an inch and is the
record for the time mentioned.
During Thursday night there were
two thunder storms. The wind was
liRht from the south throughout the
storm. The bean and raisin crops -will
suffer greatly according to the Weather
Bureau. The ground does not need
moisture at this time and the only
good that the downpour will' do so far
as is known is to extinguish the forest
fires in the north.

NOVEL POINT RAISED BY
LAWYERS IX DAMAGE SUIT
Attorneys Claim Action Against Ship
ping Firm Should Be Brought
Where Vessel Is Chartered.
ASTORIA, Ore., Sept. 23.â A case of
far-reaching importance is before Cir
cuit Judge McBrlde for decision. The
action is that of Charlotte Grimburc
vs. The Columbia River Packers* As
sociation to recover $5000 damages for
the death of her husband, who was
killed by falling from the mast of the
ship St. Nicholas, under charter of the
defendant corporation, but owned by
G. W. Hume & Co. of San Francisco.
The defendants' attorneys â¢ raise the
point that the vessel was part of the
State of California, and that the ac
tion should have been- brought there,
while the plaintiff's attorneys contend
that the charter of the ship to the
local concern made her a part of Ore
gon during the life of the charter*
La<-e House Flooded With Water and
Street Work Is Injured.
OAKLAND, Sent. 23. â A record
breaking downpour of rain, coming at
a time when little or no provision had
been made for a storm, damaged the
stocks of several mercantile firms last
night and played havoc with street
work under way by contractors and
city officials.
H. C. Capwell & Co. of the Lace
House estimate their loss at $20,000.
They are the principal sufferers from
the flood. Defective and inadequate
drain pipes on the roof of the Blake
block, occupied by the Lace House,
forced the water to the center of the
roof, where it flowed into the skylight
and from there down to the street
floor and basement. For hours the
water percolated through a stock of
fine dry goods, carrying ruin In every
direction and forcing the firm to lock
its doors to-day, suspending business
for twenty-four hours.
Goods in the tailoring house of A. S.
Colin at 1071 Broadway were dam
aged by rain, which filtered through a
skylight. The loss is about $500.
Blankets in the basement of Kahn
Bros, were damaged; loss $250.
Street contractors estimate their
losses by the storm at about $5000
and the city has street work damaged
in about the same proportion.
The rainfall is the heaviest in Sep
tember for thirty years.

RUSSIAN'S DRIVEN BACK.
By Sally Sharp.
The Sequoia Club made its debut at
the St. Francis last night In the social
life of San Francisco, and with flow
ers and music and good-fellowghip was
it welcomed, as over the punch â which
was distinctly good â came the toast,
"Here's to the Sequoia! May it have
the enduring life and the alluring hos
pitality of its namesake."
It wasn't nice of Mr. McAdle to be
off visiting on such an auspicous date â
and without so much as~leavlng orders
for decent weather. It rained, and
thundered, and shot forked lightning
at the hour of 9, but it didn't dampen
the congenial spirits who are on the
Sequoia's charter list-â for a goodly
hundred had checked umbrellas before
William Greer Harrison took the floor
in the red -room to sav things. Among
the later was thp delicious announce
ment that "the law of the Sequoia Club
is that there shall be no law." Cheers!
Mr. Harrison is a trump! In his own
good way, he presented some clever
people 'who do thingsâ and who do
them cleverly. Among the latter were
George Chase, who gave some ex
quisite Hawaiian melodies on the vio
lin; Miss M. McCloskey, Miss Kruger,
accompanied by Miss Julia Thorp, and
Mr. G. Campbell, some fine vocal num
bers; Miss S. Slater, a piano solo, and
John McNaught and Alfred J. Water
house some mighty pretty stories. And
meanwhile, were there punch and con
versation.
The green roomâ the real home of the
clubâ was graced with green things
from the canyons over the bay, and on
the walls hung four fascinating pic
tures from the willing hands of S.
Maynard Dixon, Xavier Martinez, G. F.
R. Piazzonl and John M. Gamble.
Among those who wandered about
the reception rooms chatting and
listening were:

CLOUDBURST FLOODS MILL.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 23.â The heav
iest rain in the history of the town for
September has been .experienced here
since yesterday. The precipitation
amounts to more than three inches. It
caused the streams to rise, and San
Lorenzo Creek became quite high. The
ripe grape crop is nearly ruined. There
was a cloudburst this afternoon at La
guna Creek. It came sweeping down
the canyon and flooded Chase's mill,
badly damaging it.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Sept. 23.âCon
siderable rain fell here last night. The
shower was accompanied by a strong
southerly wind.
WOODLAND, Sept.. 23.â The rainfall
for the twenty-four hours ending at 8
o'clock this morning amounted to 1.40
inches â the heaviest rain in September
for several years. Great damage has
already been done to grapes and hay
in Yolo County. Prominent local grow
ers said to-day that practically all the
grapes unpickefi are ruined and .fit only
for hog feed. The hay may be. used for
feed, but its market value is seriously
impaired. .
VALLEJO, Sept. 23.â More than an
inch of rain fell here during the last
twelve hours. Many buildings in Vallejo
were flooded. The showers were the
heaviest seen in Vallejo and Mare Isl
and for years.
SUISUN, Sept. 23.â The heaviest rain
storm ever known here at this season of
the year has been raging almost con
tinuously for the last thirty-six hours.
More than two and p. half inches of
rain has fallen. Old settlers who have
been here for fifty years say they never
saw such rainfall In the month of Sep
tember. Considerable damage has been
done to prunes in the drying yards, and
the bean crop in the eastern part of the
county has also suffered heavily.
VENTURA, Sept. 23.â Ventura Coun
ty received a drenching to-day. The
bean crop will not be damaged, though
only 20 per cent of the crop cut and
lying out has been threshed. If good
weather follows the storm no damage
will be done.' Beets are not injured.
Only a long continued wet spell can
hurt the beans and It is considered too
Â¦early for winter rains.
COLUSA IX DARKNESS.
COLUSA, Sept. 23.â Colusa is in
darkness to-night on account of the
terrible rainstorm that commenced at
10 o'clock Thursday night and with the
exception of a couple of hours has con
tinued in one steady downpour. It is
still raining and a heavy storm is ex
pected to-night. The precipitation is
m<>re than two Inches.
P.esides ruining all the dry feed the
rain will cause, great damage to grain,
prunes and raisins, especially to the
grain piled on the river banks awaiting
shipment. There are more than sixty
thousand bags Â¦ of grain on the river
banks above Coluaa and nearly one
third as much more below Colusa.
This is the heaviest rainstorm Co
lU6a County has had in September
since 1879.
SANTA ROSA, Sept. 23.â Last night's
rainstorm was the most severe ever
known here this time of the year. Rain
fell in torrents all night. The damage
to grapes, tomatoes and late feed is
likely to be heavyi
AUBURN, Sept. 23.â It began rain
ing here yesterday and up to this morn-
Ing at 7 o'clock one Inch of rain fell.
It is still falling. The first rain last
year fell on October 10.
YUBA CITY, Sept. 23.â A severe
storm drenched this city last night.
Two and one-quarter inches of rain
fell. Damage is reported to fruit and
the late summer crops. The weather
is still showery.
PASO ROBLES, Sept. 23.â Rain com
menced to fall here early this morning
and at 6 o'clock the precipitation was
2/50 inches. The damage will not be
great as the grain is nearly all in the
warehouses. The greatest damage will
be to the dry feed, which will be
ruined.
CALISTOGA, Sept. 23. â The heaviest
rainstorm that has ever visited this
section in September began yesterday.
The fall amounted to more than three
inches. Considerable damage was done
to drying prunes, but' It is said the
grape crop will not be seriously dam
aired. Â«
ST. HELENA, Sept. 23. â The rain
which began here yesterday afternoon
continued all through the night the-ra
beiner at times a heavy downpour. T'p
to this morning at 10 o'clock 2%
inches of rain had fallen in town,
while farther up the valley the pre
cipitation amounted to 3% inches. So
far the rain has not Injured the grape
crop, but should the damn weather
continue much damage will result, as
but a small portion of the crop has
been taken in.

Sacramento streets and at Twenty
third and Valencia streets.--'
The average rainfall for September
is .22 of an inch in San Francisco. The
rainiest previous September in the his
tory of the Weather Bureau was in
1S9S, when the rainfall was 1.06 inches.
And yet for twenty-four hours only of
the present storm the depth registered
was nearly three times as great. The
previous record for an hour's rainfall
was .55 of an inch. Between 12 o'clock
Thursday night and 1 o'clock yester
day morning "the rainfall was .88.
It is quite pdssible that the storm
may continue for several days yet. If
the pressures counteract the disturb
ance will remain stationary. If there
is a slight giving way of the pressure
in the southwest, the storm will travel
down the coast. From a meteorologi
cal standpoint the storm is peculiar in
many ways. It appeared suddenly,
spread over an immense area and was
extraordinarily severe. At the very
center of the disturbance the rainfall
was only .22 of an inch in twenty-four
hours. At Red Bluff the depth regis
tered in the day was nearly four inches.
Shortly after: 6 o'clock last night the
rain began' to fall rapidly again, while
the thunder boomed distantly and an
occasional flash of lightning could be
seen. ' ~

CLEVELAND, Sept. 23. â Judge
Selzcr placed himself emphatically on
record to-day for men's rights in dis
poslng' of the charge of neglect to pro
vide for children brought against
Louis Memmer. It was the wife of
Mpmmer who brought the charge.
Mommer declared that he had loved
.jnd worked for his wife and family
for thirteen years, but she refused to
li've him.
"In a Rood many of these cases."
said the Judge, "I find that the wife
is to blame. If her husband comes
home i-eacefully inclined then the
wife begins to nag. The result is he
poes and gets drunk â and I don't
blame him."
Call to Arms,
Jewish Reserves at Odessa Ijrnoro the
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 23. â The
mobilization at Odessa has been en
tirely successful, except as regards the
Jewish reserve men. 50 per cent of
whom have eluded the call to the
colors by going abroad or transferring
their domicile to neighboring prov
inces where there is no mobilization.
The total number of reserve men
called out in the city district is 17.000,
of which 4000 Jews and S00 Christians
did not respond. The places of the
missing Jews are being filled with
Christians.
The reports in the foreign press
that Lieutenant General Stoessel, the
commander of the Russian military
forces at Port Arthur, is of Jewish
descent, are denied by his niece, resid
ing in St. Petersburg. General Stoes
sel's grandfather was a Lutheran, a
general in the Russian army, and
played a conspicuous part In repelling
the Napoleonic invasion. His father
was converted to orthodoxy and also
served in the army.

CHICAGO. Sept. 23.â To save a $250.
Â©00 contract, F. M. Pease of the Chi
cago Car and Locomotive Works broke
all records on the Pennsylvania Rail
road, between Philadelphia and Chi
cago, in a special train that arrived
here this morning. With the train
drawn by the latest and most powerful
of Pennsylvania locomotives and con
sisting of one Pullman sleeping-car and
a combination day car, the 822 miles
between the cities were traversed in
just seventeen hours and fifty-seven
minutes â two hours and forty-seven
minutes quicker than the trip is made
by the railroad company's fastest train,
"the limited."
It cost Pease 51664 to make the trip,
exclusive of meals and tips, but he ac
complished his purpose and closed a big
contract.
A mile a minute was slow for the
easy grades to Harrisburs. The long
climb west of Duncannon, which did
not end until Altoona was passed, was
hardly noticed. Pittsburg expected
that the train vrould arrive somewhere
around 1 o'clock. It passed at two
minutes after 12 o'clock.
Out on the level country, with fresh
engines, the speed was increased to
seventy miles an hour, and even
seventy-five miles was made on level
tangent*.
CUMBERLAND, W. Va., Sept. 23.â
A fast freight on the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad struck a wagon loaded
with 750 pounds of dynamite at a
crossing at North Branch to-day. Two
trainmen were killed and nine persons
seriously injured, three of them seri
ously.
James Laing, driver of the wagon,
escaped injury, except for a rupture
of the eardrums. The horses were un
hurt, although thrown over a fence.
Several small buildings, the locomo
tive and several cars were demolished,
and windows were shattered a mile
away on a mountain.
MUKDEN. Sept. 23.â The Russians
are using war balloons southeast of
Mukden to observe the movements of
the Japanese. The line of outposts esr
tablished by the Japanese is so effect
ive that even the Chinese have been
unable to penetrate it. It is impossible,
therefore, to say definitely how Mar
quis Oyama has disposed his forces.
It is believed General Kuroki's
army stretches from Benishu to Bent
siaputze and the armies of Generals
Oku and Nodzu from Yentai along the
high road and railroad to Shahepu,
sixteen miles south of Mukden, while
a fourth army is moving from Dzian
tchan across the Da Mountains. All
these roads converge at Mukden.
Of the four armies those of Oku and
Nodzu are nearest Mukden and their
progress will have to be slackened in
order to permit Kuroki and the flank-
Ing columns time to come up. Mean
time Oku and Nodzu have command
of the railroad. Supplies of grain and
ammunition are carried from Yentai
over heavy roads and exposed to cap
ture by Cossack raiders.
There has been an improvement in
the weather at Mukden, which has
been a great help to the Japanese.
CHEFU, Sept. 24.â A Japanese who
has arrived here from Dalny says that
the battle which began at Port Arthur
on September 19 continued during Sep
tember 20, but he is unable to give
any details of the fighting. On Sep
tember 21 and September 22 the Jap
anese bombardment was slight. The
Japanese says that there were unveri
fied rumors at Dalny to the effect
that the Japanese had made some
gains.
The bombardment of September 19
began at 3 o'clock in the morning and
lasted one hour. At dawn the volume
of firing increased to an extent hitherto
unknown. Some of the heavy guns,
which had been lately placed, opened
fire from a quarter which had previ
ously been silent. During the fiercest
firing the heavy guns were fired at an
average of twice in one minute. Every
window in Dalny shook.
The firing continued heavy during
the night of September 20. Thereafter
it was inconsequential.
Chinese from a village near Port Ar
thur confirm the foregoing and add
that while off the Miatotao Islands
yesterday they heard firing from 10
o'clock in the morning until 4 o'clock
in the afternoon.

They are the men to deal with whenln need of anything in their lme, which usuany i
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and tne uu
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial a jpp â¢
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of tne dot .
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their grea
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that 1 ?, 0
Figaisjin excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and r tb^ rel Xj"J JL
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the C Â£ O1( Â£ S J
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing tnc > iu i
name of the Company-California Fig Syrup Co.-printed on the front of every P^age.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation ana
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its enecia aÂ»
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction. .
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives ana ido
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but tnere are
individual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not nesiiaxe
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have the nameâ" Syrup of Figs"â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name 01
the Companyâ California Fig* Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup, wnicn
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter ms
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation ana
and deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the tilling oi
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company-
California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class or
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

Baa Frmndaco.Coroner J. K. Kelly took charge of
the remains and an inquest will be
held Saturday, when It is hoped some
clew will be found to explain the rea
son for taking her life.
She was about 22 years of age and a
brunette. She left no note to explain
her rash act and the husband can as
sign no reason, as she had appeared in
a happy and contented mood during
the day. The deed was committed with
a 33-caliber revolver, the property of
Chandler. So true was her aim that
life was extinct before the husband,
who had only stepped from the door,
could re-enter the room.
Mn and Mrs. Chandler have resided
In this city for the last two months.
They were married less than a year
ago and made many friends here dur
ing: their short residence. They wera
apparently very happy and were con
stantly-together. Harry Chandler, tha
husband, is a eon of ex-Senator J. L.
Chandler. He was bofcn and raised ia
the southern part of Sutter County,
where he is well and favorably known.
Some months ago he made his home in
Lincoln, Placer County. There he met
and married the woman who to-day
took her own life.
MARYSVILLE, Sept. 23.â This after
noon, after asking her husband to step
out into the hall for a minute while she
prepared a surprise for him, Mrs. Ade
laide Chandler fired a bullet through
her heart. * /

Weimer abandoned Lutheranism in
order that the wedding might conform
with the wishes of his bride's family.
Ten years ago when a mere boy tha
noted left-handed pitcher was married
at Des Moines, Iowa, the union being
unhappy and of- brief duration. Di
vorce followed and the - former Mrs.
Weimer took up her home In Los An
geles, Car* where she now is with her
little daughter.
Never giving a thought to the possi
bility of such an incident in his life
none of the Trumbull family asked
Weimer if he had married before, and
not appreciating its significance to a
Roman Catholic family Weimer made
no reference to it.
So it was not until after the cere
mony that the family learned of the
true state of affairs. Since then Wei
mer and she have exchanged corre
spondence, but have not met.
CHICAGO, Sept. 23.â A bride of a
few hours, Laura Trumbull "Weimer,
wife of Jacob Weimer, the crack pitch
er of the Chicago National League
Baseball team, it is announced to-day,
fled from his arms to take refuge at tha
home of her N father, George T. Trum
bull, president of the Trumbull Safe &
Vault Company. She had discovered
that Weimer had been divorcedâ a
condition not recognized by the Roman
Catholic church, of which she Is a de
vout member. Now they are far apart,
Weimer in Brooklyn with his club and
his bride at her parents' home.
Friends and relatives are trying to
untangle the complications. Whether
the separation will be permanent or
the newly" married couple will be re
united no one pretends to be able to
say.
"We are waiting to see," said Mrs.
Weimer between sobs to-day. "We are
waiting â that is all I can say."
Mrs. Weimer's eyes were red with
weeping and it was apparent the shock
had borne heavily upon her. It was
the first time she had left her room
since she sought its solitude within a
few hours of her wedding. Reports
from the Cast indicate that Weimer.
too, has felt the blow. He is said to
look haggard and to have lost nearly
forty pounds In weight through wor
rying. The ceremony was performed
by Bishop Muldoon a week ago.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 23.âNoth

who committed suicide, in London to
day and whose father Is said to be a
Kansas ranchman. Inquiry at the
stockyards and elsewhere developed no
information.
LONDON, Sept. 23.-George A. Davis,
said to be the son of a wealthy ranch
owner of Kansas City, was found dead
in bed at a leading London hotel to

beside the body. It is supposed that
D f^ is i wl }Â° f wa a here on a visit, com
mitted suicide.
Davis, who was 26 years old, came to
London about two weeks ago with his
wife on a pleasure tour. On Tuesday
he was slightly/Indisposed and a phy
sician was called in and prescribed for
him, but the complaint was not seri
ous. Mrs. Davis occupied an adjoining
room. She is prostrated and is unable
to throw any light on her husband's
death. When the body was found Mrs.
Davis telegraphed to her husband's
father, J. J. Davis of Kansas City, who

Foster laid stress on the importance
of establishing a system of diplomacy
which would not subject representa
tives to inconvenience and even in
dignity because of their lower rank
as Ministers. He added:
The late trouble between the United States
and Turkey grew out of the fact that thÂ»
American Minister could not have access to
the Sultan and higher officials, because hÂ«
did not possess the rank of an Embassador
and the Turkish Government refused to agre*
to the appointment and recognition of Embas

ST. LOUIS, Sept. 23.â At the request
of Dr. H. M. Bishop of Los Angeles,
the police to-day were instructed to
search for his wife, who failed to re
. turn last night to their room in the
Epworth Hotel. Dr. Bishop describes
her as 35 years old, five feet eight
inches in height, light hair, blue eyes,
light complexion, weight 118 pounds
and wearing a blue hat and veil and
blue tailor-made suit.
Much mystery attaches to Mrs.
Bishop's disappearance, and it is feared
that she has been murdered or has com
mitted sulcida.
LOS ANGELES,.Sept- 23.â Dr. H. M.
Bishop, whose home is at 2637 Hoover
street, is a physician of limited prac
tice, limited only because he does not
care to devote his entire time to his
profession. He is a man of wealth and
his home is one of the finest in an
aristocratic neighborhood. With his
wife he came here about eight years
ago from New London, Conn. Mrs.
Bishop has been an invalid for many
years, suffering from some nervous
disease which failed to yield to treat
ment. She therefore was seen but lit
tle in society, although she went out
occasionally.
Dr. Bishop and wife went East three
months ago to visit their old home in
Connecticut and the St. Louis exposi
tion. They have no children, their only
relative here being Normal Bishop, a
nephew of the doctor. He said to
night that the last he had heard from
them they were in Connecticut, about to
start West. Dr. Bishop is perhaps 50
years of age.

field all over the wort*,A. F. Morrison, one of the attor
neys for Dr. Emma L. Merritt, exec
utrix of the will of Adolph Sutro, be
gan his argument in defense of the
charity trust clause of the will yes
terday morning and had hot finished
when court adjourned yesterday after
noon. He will resume next Thursday.
Mr. Morrison argued many law points
in support of the validity of such a
trust as the one created by Sutro and
in disproving the argument of the
other side that it was a perpetuity
against publfc policy.
The lawyer* read and analyzed the
provisions of the will relating to the
trust and declared it could not be
imagined that a scheme for immoral
use of the property or private gain
would be formulated by the high pub
lic officials who are to constitute the
permanent board of trustees. The rule
against perpetuities, said Mr. Morri
son, was against the greed of selfish
men who wanted to build up big for
tunes and big families. In Sutro's
case it was an exhibition of his faith
in the future of this community. He
had not made the trust for the bene
fit of the Sutro family or for himself
unless in the. glory that would come
to his memory, but the benefits would
come into being after the last of his
children was dead. There was not an
element of selfishness in Sutro's Inten
tion; it was the very essence of char
ity and entirely for the advancement
of the public good.

CALIFORNIAXS AT THE FAIR.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 23. â The follow
ing California visitors have registered
at the California building:
At Santa Rosa, waiting for the'train,
the singers burst Into a glnd refrain,
which in the phrasing and the trilling
showed the results of Reige's careful
drilling:.
"Toot-toot!" the engine blew a warn
ing blast. Teutonla's outing was for
ever past.
Where Santa Rosa in the valley lies,
beneath the arch of ever smiling skies,
a week ago, on idlest pleasure bent, Teu
tonla's singers in a body went. And
there four stages decked with banners
gay, each with four steeds to haul the
crowd away, stopped for their coming;
thence to Mark West Springs were
whirled away swift as on eagles' wings.
Arriving, with their appetites in
creased by mountain air, they eager
sought the feast prepared by that famed
chef â Mrs. Beguhl â and each gave
praise and ate till all were full. What
pen can do full justice to the spread
with eo superb a caterer at the head!
The President â F.Gercke â In a speech
gave generous welcome unto all and
each, while guests and members to the
toasts responded until the groves with
loud huzzas resounded.
At night a ball, whence Care and Mel
ancholy were driven forth by Mirth and
arrant Folly â burned on a pyre raised in
a sylvan dell, and "all went merry as a
marriage bell."
Each guest a lantern bore in long pro
cession, while at the last, to serve as a
digression, a Coffee Klatch closed with a
fresh delipht the revelry that stirred the
quiet night.
On Sunday a prize shoot took place,
where men and women marred the tar
get's face, for which rare prizes to the
winners went. So passed the hours un
til the day was spent.
At night a minstrel- show so full of
joshes that many wished they had put
on galoshes, tears so profuse were there
in laughter shed o'er some live jokes and
some a Ions time dead.
Herr Blltner was the one particular
star the audience hailed as being 1 best by
far. Whenever in his stunt there came a
pause the welkin rang with deafening
applause. Then came another banquet.
Why repeat allusions to a feast com
plete in every smallest detail to invite
attention e'en from frailest appetite!
Many the favors which the guests en
joyed and through it all their bliss was
unalloyed until on Monday, when they
all departed, and hosts and guests alike
were heavy hearted.
To that committee planning these glad
days all present gave the highest meed
of praise. F. Gercke, Blanert. C. Geb
bart, In every smallest detail took a
part; W. Gercke. Hartmann and F.
Schaefer conjointly with them made the
programme safer; while to Herr Koerner
and his charming frau none could suffi
cient praise allow.

Eugene Van Court, boxing instructor
of the Olympic Club, San Francisco,
was relieved of his pocket book r con
taining a draft for $200. at the fair
grounds this week. Van Court says
there must be some pretty clever
tlileves here, for he was In no crowd

was- taken from his inner coat pocket.
He had the payment on the draft stop

Sergeant James Rainsborough of the
San Francisco Police Department stop

from the G. A. R. encampment in Bos

Three days later he found it neces

His mind reverted back. He frowned.
Mrs. Netz* watermelon is rivaled by

to Colvin Brown, who has charge of the
San Joaquin booth: "If you keep on
playing that pretty song, Mr. Brown,
you'll surely have us all in Stockton

At the fair grounds the melon acci
dentally went astray. M|p. Netz want
ed it to go to the San Joaquin exhibit
in the Palace of Agriculture, and It
was taken to the Palace of Horticul
ture. The devoted woman was nearly
exhausted when she finally recovered
her treasure. It now rests In state on
one corner of San Joaquin's exhibit
with Henry Ellis' watchful eye and a
card bearing Mrs. Xetz' name upon It.
Her anxious search for it here brought
out the story of Its Journey from Cali
fornia.
Mrs. Netz wouldn't trust the melon out
of her sight, so she had it put in her
berth in the sleeper and part of the
time she used it for a pillow. She ex
hibited it to the natives and told them
if anything happened to it the pleasure
of her trip to St. Louis would be ruin
ed. The native? straightway stole it
and had it put in the baggage car. Mrs.
Xetz recovered it again and then the
Natives hid it. bought one as near like
it as they could and sat down to eat
it in Mrs. Xetz' section. She nearly
fainted and wept with joy when her
melon was produced.
MELON' GOES ASTRAY.

When Mrs. Netz made up her mind
to visit the exposition she determined
that fhe would bring; something along
that would open the eyes of the Mis
*ourians. She passed by pumpkins
that throw shadows on top of the
chitken-houses and sweet potatoes out
of which the children made canoes as
too common and picked out a beauti
ful watermelon with corrugated Fides.
She couldn't bring the largest she had,
for she couldn't carry it, but she is a
ttrong woman, and got one well cal
culated to make Missourians jealous.
Then began that long trip toward the
ether rim of the continent with the
watermelon and it will go down the
years in San Joaquin song and. story.
Some d.iy in one of the public
Squares of Stockton will be erected a
monument to Mrs. Mary Menges Netz
of Rlpon. San Joaquin County. A tale

Southern California has good rep
resentation at the fair this week
through it* Editorial Association and

WORLD'S FAIR. Sept. 23. â San Fran
clsc*r.s who have visited the St. Louis
world's fairâ and there have been many
prominent ones hereâ have nearly all
formed the opinion, after noting the
eucccss of the fcan Francisco building
on the model street, that the California
metropolis should have a "day" at the
fair some time tarly In October. Every
State and some cltkF have had. or will
have, special days. a.nd it seems to be
the Impression among visiting San
Franciscans that California's principal
city would reap a great benefit by cele
hiating hrre and doing something that
would be remembered.
The cost of a proper celebration is
variously Â«>5timated at from $3000 to
J&000. The plan that has met most
favor among the visitors is to have a
parade and then dispense fruits and
vines from a tent, which could be
erected on a vacant space back of the
San Francisco building. There Is quite
a large grass covered plat there on
which exercises could be held. The San
Francisco committee could easily ar
range with the exposition officials for
bands and parade features. In fact
the fair people would be only too glad
to have such a city as San Francisco
celebrate Jn an way, and
would lend every assistance. A large
excursion should be i<ent on for the
celebration. /

The Atchison Company has outstand

000 common stock. The majority of the
entire outstanding stock of the Atchi
son system is. therefore, $108,099,750.
The rumored purchase of 500,000
shares of Atchison common, having a
par value of $50,000,000, would give of
itself, an amount less than one-naif of
the outstanding common stock and less
than one-quurter of the entire stock
Issue. Such a block would, however, in
all probability carry control.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â There was a
Stock Exchange rumor this afternoon
that almost 500,000 shares of Atchison
had been transferred by a big banking
house to Rockefeller interests, which
the rumor had it. would hold the stock
in the interest ot the Union Pacific.
The report ran directly counter to the
guesses of last week, that there had
been some kind of a breach between
E. II. Harriman and his Rockefeller
allies.

James Lawler, who, according to his
attorney, James P. Sweeney, is no per
son of consequence, recovered from a
spree on the first of this month to find
that he had been robbed of his single
blessedness. He applied to the Superi
or Court yesterday to annul his mar
riage with Katie Redwin, which, he
â¢says, took place on August 31. alleg
ing that on that date he was "un
conscious and maudlin from the-exces
sive use of alcoholic stimulants." He
was not aware of his actions at the
time and says a license was procured
and the marriage ceremony performed
when he did not know what he "was
doing. An examination of the records
shows that the license was not issued
in this county.
Harold E. Elliot, a drummer for J.
J. Adams & Co. of New York, yester
day filed an answer to the suit of his
wife, Nettle, for divorce. She charged
him with cruelty and Intemperance and
said that while living with him they
were ejected from various apartments
for non-payment of rent and bills. He
denies her charges specifically and in
return accuses her of a fondness for
the company of other men.
Divorces were granted by Judge Gra
ham to Flora Cantwell from John
Cantwell, . desertion; Mary A. Monroe
from Barton G. Monroe, desertion; by
Judge Sloss to Minnie L. Hatch from
F. A. Hatch, neglect ($40 a month ali
mony, granted); by Judge Kerrigan to
Florence Schneider from William C.
Schneider, neglect; to Abraham Sha
piro from Hattie S. Shapiro, neglect.
Suits for divorce were filed by Flor

Bowman, neglect and desertion; Ella
M. Wachter against John O. Wachter,
cruelty; John Pool against Mary Pool,
desertion; Robert H. Ellis against Mae
Ellis, desertion; Kuna Szmulowltz

R. Wood, pending 1 the trial of her suit
for divorce, a subpena has been issued
; Flora Karlson, whose husband owns
new and second hand furniture stores
at 1215 Market street and 1131 Mission
street, yesterday sued him for divorce
on the ground of cruelty and got an
order of the court temporarily restrain
ing him from disposing of his property.
In her recital of his mistreatment she
says that on various occasions he as
saulted her with his fists, a chair, iron
bar and iron hook. He was so parsi
monious, she says, that ne would allow
her no money for household expenses
and compelled her to eat at cheap res
taurants, giving her fifty cents a day
â¢uith which to satisfy the cravings of
the Inner woman.
The police have been for a week
making an unsuccessful search for
Mrs. Mary Cox, wife of J. N. Cox, who
is connected with the lumber business
of Julius Heyman, 22 Market street.
Detective Anthony, who has been spe
cially detailed on the case, has come
to the conclusion that she has gone to
Tacoma, Wash., where her father died
recently leaving a large estate. Mrs.
Cox is accompanied by her daughter,
Florence, G years of age. She must
have been married when very- young,
as her present age is given as 24
years.
The family residence of Mr. and Mrs.
Cox is at Point Arena. The cook for
the family was a pretty girl IS years
of age, and Mrs. Cox, .it is said, be
came jealous of the pretty cuok and
flatly told her husband that the cook
had to leave the house or she would.
Cox thought she was not serious and
did not discharge the cook.
On the morning of September 14
Mrs. Cox left Point Arena taking her
daughter Florence with her. Cox says
she also took $621 which happened to be
in the house at the time. The police
were notified and Detective Anthony
made an investigation and discovered
that Mrs. Cox, under, the name of Mrs.
Mary Cox Wallace, fatopped with fier
daughter in the Winchester House on
Third street till the morning of Sep
tember 13. From that time no trace
of her has been found either by her
husband or the police. She has several
friends in this city, but none of them
have seen her for some months. Cox
Is anxious for her to return, and he
will promise her that her wishes in
future In regard to pretty cooks will be
promptly obeyed.

According to the same authority
there are more than 4000 persons in the
Tonopah district, which was discovered
by James Butler in 1900. From its dis
covery up to the last day of December,
1901. $4,500,000 wag produced. The min
eral zone is 7000 feet long by 5000 feet
wide. ' Besides gold and silver, copper,
lead, antimony, Einc, quicksilver, gyp
sum, fireclay, chalk, soapstone, borax
and alum have been found in Nye
County, in which Tonopah is mainly
situated.
It is officially set forth that Storey
County has produced $600,000,000 in the
Comstock mines. Values as high as
$700 a ton have been found in rock at
the Wedekind mines near Reno, In
Washoe County. In Lyon County Is
situated Silver City, one of the richest
mining districts in Nevada. Cyanlding
has performed wonders and Is being
pursued upon a large scale. Gold and
silver quartz ledges have been discov
ered in the central and southern parts
of the county, particularly at Como.
Copper mines are operated profitably
in the eastern part of the county. Eu
reka County is credited with mineral
production of $125,000,000, being second
only to Storey County in this respect.
The production of Lincoln County in
gold and silver and copper to date is
reported to have exceeded $30,000,000.
Other metals besides gold, silver, cop
per and lead exist. The zinc mines of
one company are reported to contain
$5,000,000 in zinc, that could be profit
ably extracted if cheap transportation
were provided.
The Goldfields district is in Esmer
alda County. It bids fair to rival Tono
pah. Included in the county are the
Aurora, Pine Grove, Hawthorne, Pal
metto, Silver Peak, Candelaria, Silver
Star, Tule Canyon, Montezuma >and
Cambridge camps that are credited
with having produced not less than
$20,000,000, principally in silver. Since
the" decline in the value of silver rich
gold ledaes have been opened.
The Chamber reports that the prin
cipal mines of the Goldflelds district
show an average surface value of ore
o-f $275 per ton and a value of $1467 at
a depth of fifty feet in the Jumbo and
$200 and $400 per ton in gold in other
mines.
One seventh of the State of Nevada is
covered by Elko County, which has an
area of 10.972,000 acres. While it is not
considered a leading mining county, it
is credited with having produced value
of $10,000,000 in silver. Gold ledges have
been recently opened and are produc
ing profitably. Churchill County has
veins of gold and silver. Douglas Coun
ty has placer mines, and the Pine Nut
Mountains, in the eastern part of tire
county, are seamed with ledges of
quartz. Gold mines have been profitably
worked in the southern part of the
county with profit during many years.
Gold discoveries have been made re
cently in White Pine County and placer
mines are being worked extensively at
Osceola by the hydraulic process and
annually yield a Urge amount of gold.
Some of the richest silver mines in the
State are in White Pine County.
PIIODLCKS MILLIONS.
Every day new discoveries are made. No one
ever heard of Tonopah until late in 1000 nor of
Uoldflelds until two years later. It Is there
fore reasonable to suppose that many more
rich and productive districts will be discov
ered when the ubiquitous prospector reaches
them. It is not to be supposed that no pros
pecting has been done along these ranges;
thty have all Iwen traversed by eager eeekera
after gold and gilvrr, tut various causes led to
many promising Icdgo6 and placers being
abandoned for the time being. Among these
causes may be mentioned inaccessibility, scar
city of water, lack of trantsportation facilities
end lacl: uf funds.
While the mountain ranges run near
ly north and south, the mineral belts
that are known run, generally speak
ing, east and west. One belt in partic
ular, in Elko County, extending east
and west. Is nearly forty miles wide and
150 miles in length. Gold placers and
ledges have been discovered through
out the entire length of this belt. The
area of Nevada is 71,000,000 acres,
mostly mountainous. The author says:
The mining industry of Nevada is
treated, with other State topics, by the
Nevada Chamber of Commerce. . W. T.
Moran of Virginia City is the author of
the statements that are made relative
to Nevada's mines. Some of the aver
ments are of more than common inter
est to those who take an Intelligent con
cern in mining matters. There are not
less than sixty distinct ranges of moun
tains in Nevada, and there are also
lesser chains and isolated neaks, di
vided from one another by valleys more
or less fertile. The ranges vary in
length from ten to fifty miles, and. says
Moran, "gold and silver are found in
every one of them."
BELTS OF MINERALS.
Tonopah and Goldfields are striving
to make this boast good. Placer and
ledge gold propositions are being
worked In various parts of Nevada.
The facts are reasonably' well known
In this State, but the showing that the
Nevada Chamber of Commerce is able
to make will astonish the outside world,
that has considered Nevada a distinct

Secretary Metcalf's long address may
not have been read in full by some
California miners. "What the Secretary
said about mining is segregated from
other topics and reproduced here for
its interest in this particular connec
tion: . ... .
For a Ions time after the discovery of gold
upon the Pacific Coast California was regarded
by the rest cf the world as a great mining
c*mp, dependent chiefly upon her output of
gold and Kilver for a growth, which was
ftometimes stigmatized as mushroom In lt<*
character. But recent years have changed all
that. The mining camp* Ions since became a
settled and prosperous community whose
varied activities extend Into all fields of in
dustry, snd the reputation of our State 'no
longer rests solely upon the products of Its
mln?5>. Indeed, as a producer of precious
inetalÂ» Colorado now far* outranks us, produc-
Ins almost twice nÂ« much gold and silver as
we do. In TJO2 our. mines produced about
$16.7^2.000 worth of gold, constituting over
one-fifth of the product of the 'United States,
and the total production of our State from the
year in which gold began to bo produced in
commercial quantities to the present time is
about $1,SS1,0C0.0Oij. which Is 54.4 per cent.
or more than one-half, of the total value of all
of the gold that haÂ» been produced In the
United StatPÂ«. . â¢
figures for September^ The yiald of
August sold for $2,500,000. The Calu
rrfet and Hecla produced 6,400.000
pounds in July and 6,500,000 pounds in
August. >No other property quite
reached the : 2,000,00|0-pound mark.
In his address at the banquet given
jn his hono-r at the Hotel St. Francis
In this city the past week, Secretary
Metcalf of tlie Department of Com
merce and Labor spoke of the great
mineral production oÂ£ Colorado and
made some comparison with the out
put of California. The production of
Colorado for 1903 was $22,000,000 in gold.
In round figures; $18,935,124 in silver;
7,809,920 pounds of copper; 101,513,414
pounds of . lead,' and 7,569,268 tons, of
coal. The official figures submitted by
State Mineralogist Aubury as repre
senting the mineral output of California
in 1902 are summarized in brief, for
products of leading â¢ importance, by
values' as follows. Gold, $16,471,264;
copper, .$2,520,937; rubble, $1,227,419;
quicksilver, $1,335,954; petroleum, $7,-

and carriages. Mission Rebekah Lodge
had a genuine hayseed float. It was
finely, arranged, ; and, laden with its
wealth of lovely women, their costumes

Then came other members of that
lodge, walking, followed by one of the
most beautiful features of the parade.
It was a chariot drawn by four mag
nificent pure white Arabian steeds,
driven by Apollo in gorgeous robes of
white and gold. A big coach, with
the words on the sides: "Our elder
brothers," contained some elderly
members of . Apollo Lodge. Little

beauty of this portion of the parade.
One was occupied by Rebekah Lodge

coach, drawn by four prancing blacks.
The other was occupied by
Golden Star Lodge from San Rafael.
It was elaborately with pink

was given the third division to take
care of. Headed by the Santa Clara
band and the Santa Clara Lodge No.
238 came one .. of the most, picturesque
floats of the parade. Fifty little boys
and girls from the Rebekah Orphans'
Home at Gilroy seated in triple tiers
en a large float draped in white and
purple and trimmed with green bows,
evoked exclamations of admiration
along the line of march.
Fourth divisionâ Then came the local
lodges forming the largest division of
the parade. The division was led by
the California Lodge band and T. W.
B. Leland, the marshal commanding,
and his aids. The lodges in line were:
California No. 1," San Francisco No. 3,
Templar No. 17 "in uniform, and Mag
nolia No. 29 headed by a little girl
dressed in white on a float trimmed
with magnolia leaves.
AN ATTRACTIVE SHOWING.
Many of the floats were very elab
orately designed. The model of the Or
phans' Home of the L O. O. F., drawn
by four horses, was an exceptionally
good feature. The Oriental float at
tracted a great deal of attention, as did
the float "Rebekah at the Well." There
were at least a score of floats with
women of the -Rebekah lodges dressed
in white seated on tiers of seats, form
ing pyramids of pretty faces and sum
mery costumes. The "Hayseed" float
All of the officials of the Sover^ig^i
Grand Lodge were in carriages, as were
the ladies who participated in the, deco
ration of chivalry ceremonies that took
place at the Pavilion Wednesday and
Thursday evenings. The officers of the
Grand Lnram?ment did not ride with
the first division, but were with the
tenth division. Shields with the names
of the States and Territories of the
United States and foreign countries
represented were attached to each car
riage of the Grand Encampment sec
tion. The flags of British Columbia,
Ontario and many other of the British
possessions were displayed frequently
with, of course, the Stars and Stripes.
While Washington Canton was al
most at the end of the line of march,
and the countermarch of the procession
was almost completed an unfortunate
incident occurred at the turning point
of the parade at Van Ness avenue and
Pine street. E. A. Bauber, who was
marching with one of the lodges from
the interior of the State, dropped to the
street. His comrades rushed to his as
sistance. An ambulance was summoned
for the patient and driven rapidly to
the Central Emergency Hospital. Medi
cal help was of no avail, for Frater
Bauber had expired before he reached
the hospital. Death was due to heart
disease.

those who stood at the curbs, and every
handsome float and every well drilled
canton was given its. full share of ap
plause.
Washington (D. C.) Canton was given
the place or honor in the line, at the
head of the column, after" the police
and general staff. The patriarchs exe
cuted many drill maneuvers on the
march and were cheered repeatedly. All
of the crack drill corps that took part
in the recent contests at Mechanics'
Pavilion were recognized by the crowds
and cheered as they marched steadily
forward with the quick, firm step of
the soldier.
First divisionâ At the head of the
first division, immediately following
the band, came W. M. Simpson, the
marshal commanding, and his aids.
The entire division consisted of lodges
from Alameda County, and among the
number were the following:. Evening

Niles, Ltyermore, Columbia. Berkeley,
Elmhurst, Harbor and old brothers
from Niles in carriages.

division was devoted to Sacramento,
and they worthily filled their place in
the line. At their head came the Platt
band and Charles D. Bliss, the marshal
commanding, and his aids. . A.-Sacra
mento f.oat .handsomely decorated, in
green and gold and bearing a camper's
tent and gold digging outfit was a feat
ure of the division. . .

PARADE BY DIVISIONS.
Following the mounted police came
the handsome uniformed Grand Mar
shal E. H. Black and his staff. They
were all mounted on gorgeously capar
isoned horses, and made an imposing
sight. Eehird them came the uni
formed infantry of the Patriarchs Mili
tant, marching rhythmic time and
swinging along with military precision.
Throughout the line of march they
performed many evolutions with a
snap that showed the result of many a
hard drill. The officers of the Patri
archs Militant were to have been the
escort of Grand Sire John B. Goodwin,
but he was summoned East last night
and did not participate in the parade.
At the head of the Patriarchs Mili
tant came tho commanding general of
the Army of Patriarchs Militant,
General M. A. Raney, accompani
ed by his staff. Following them
came Brigadier General H. O. Brow
er, commanding the department of
California, and his staff. Then
came the three regiments of march
ing Patriarchs Militant. The first
regiment was headed by Colonel W.
II. Sherburn and his staff. Among
those in the first regiment were can
tons from Sacramento and Fresno.
The second regiment was headed by
Colonel C. H. AVever and his staff, and
was composed of cantons from San
Jose, Vallejo and Watsonville. In the
third regiment Â¦were cantons from Eu
reka, San Diego; Riverside and Santa
Barbara. At their head rode Colonel
C. W. Buker and his staff. Following
the :hird regiment and heading the
carriages containing the grand repre
sentatives came a tally-ho in which
were seated the four young ladies who
officiated in the conferring of the Dec
oration and Grand Decoration of Chiv
alry at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
In this portion of. the parade came
the seventy carriages containing th->
gTanc\ representatives to' the Eightieth
Annual Session. These carriages. were
decorated with flags and bore shields
with the names of the States from
which the representatives came, as fol
lows:
At the head of the long column that
showed only a small proportion of the
membership of Odd Fellows through
oat the .State, carr.e the platoon of po
lice under the leadership of Chief of
Police George W. Wittman. In command
of this splendid body of men that well
represent the police force of the city
was Captain Henry Gleeson. Along the
entire line of march the appearance of
the police was heartily applauded by
the gathered thousands.
The last division of the parade, the
fourteenth, was made up of carriages
containing officers of the Odd Fellows'
Home at Thermalito, residents of the
home and officers and past grand of
ficers of the Rebekah Assembly.

Market street was crowded with peo
ple, but the grand stands were not
very well patronized. Van Ness avenue
was well lined on both sides with look
ers on, but there were not so many of
thTn as when the Knights Templar
paraded. The threatening weather
kr*pt many away. The stands were de
n^rted for the sidewalks, for the la
dies wanted to be near convenient
doorways in case the storm developed.

dines and nickels during the Templar

Immediately following the parade
the grand representatives of the Sov
ereign Grand Lodge met at Native
Sons' Hall and Immediately- went Into

business before the meeting was tho
hearing of reports from the States and
jurisdictions.
INSTALL GRAND SIRE-ELECT.
The grand ball at Mechanics' Pavil
ion last nlgbt was the crowning event
of the encampment. Though the rain
made the wearing of light gowns a
precarious undertaking many risked
the anger of the elements and enjoyed
i he dance. They were rewarded for
their courage and spent several pleas
ant hours unmindful of the storm.
The fact that the weather yesterday
morning permitted the holding of the
grand parade was a cause for congrat
ulation. Early in the morning the
weather prophets of the order were up
scanning the ekies and many opinions
were offered as to the chances for the
long march. The theory that no rain
would fall in the morning was gener
ally accepted, so preparations for the
march were made and the route was
covered. That the order made a splen
did showing every one admitted, though
the fear of rain kept out of line many
v. ho otherwise would have participated.
Sovereign Grand Lodge week of the
Independent Order of Odd Fellows has
passed and the story of another note
worthy gathering is entered on the
pages cf San Francisco's history. The
city has kept up its reputation for hos
pitality and this hospitality has been
appreciated by all who accepted it.
Yesterday was the busiest since the
opening of the encampment. The fact
that the delegates to the Grand En
campment of California and the on
cers of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of
the United States and Canada were
weary after the parade did not deter
them from going on with their busi
ness meetings in the afternoon, at
which they completed much work. But
one thing remains to be done by the
Sovereign Grand Lodge â the appoint
ment cf five officers, which duty is in the
hards of the grand officers heretofore
elected.
Other business of the afternoon
session consisted of reducing 1 the gen
eral per capita from 60 to 50 cents.
As the next encampment will be held
in the extreme southern end of the
State the mileage assessment was in
creased from 23 to 43 cents per capita.
The encampment adjourned with a
general hand-shaking and expressions
of good will among its members, who
hope to meet in San Diego next year.
The report of the committee of ap
peals was one of the most gratifying:
received during the session of the en
campment. This year, as for the last
four years, not a case has been refer
red to it. This is considered an ex
traordinary record and one of which
the grand officers are justly proud.

John K. Brown, lawyer, of Seattle
has been cited to appear before the
United States Court of Appeals on Oc
tober 17 and show cause why he
should not be disbarred for violating
the trust reposed in him by a client.
The charge against Brown is that he
received from the husband of Martha
H. Shields of Alaska $200 for the pur
pose of filing certain papers in the suit
of Mrs. Shields against the Mogolllon
Mining Company and that he ne
glected to file the papers, thereby
causing his client to lose the suit. The
litigation involved the title to valu
able mining property in Alaska. It
was charged further that Brown was
on a spree at the time.
Mrs. Shields has asked the Circuit
Court of Appeals to reopen the min
ing case and has submitted affidavits
showing how the default occurred.
One of these is by Brown, who admits
that it was entirely through his
neglect that the case was lost.

votes of the members of both houses
in the next Legislature in regard to
all labor measures, such as the eight
hour, anti-injunction and other sim

The object of taking these records
and preserving them is to give the la
bor men a line on whom they shall
support at the elections. They ex
pect to learn who is voting In their in-,
terests and who is opposed to them.
This action was taken on recommend

A desire to explore the mysteries

to wander away from their home at
33 Minna street yesterday afternoon.
Several hours later the two young
sters, aged seven and six years re
spectively, applied at the City Hall
station for a night's lodgfng. They
were accompanied by Princess, a fox
terrier. The children. although
drenched and shivering from the rain,
displayed the greatest solicitude" for
their dumb companion. The trio were
taken to the Central Emergency Hos
pital and placed In charge of Matron
Kathleen Wynne. They related a re
markable tale of having broken an
umbrella belonging to Dale senior,
for which death was the penalty. It
was on this account they declared
that they had sought the protection
of the police. Upon the arrival of
Mrs. Dale it was ascertained that the
boys had left the parental roof on an

the umbrella was without foundation.

A daring housebreaker, captured at

Jail* here to-day. He Rives his name
as Joseph Jose. He was found climbing

be all but made his escape.
Fred Itayer. Joseph Soarcs and
pCpBly County Clerk Zambreski were
returning home about 12:30 o'clock lasÂ»t

their rooms Soares and Hayer, looking
down some stairs and through a tran-
Bom, saw Jose climbing through a win
dow into the barroom.
Neither of the men had a weapon,
and lUyer had about $C00 in his pocket
belonging to the N. S. G. W. Carnival
Association, which is holding a street
fair at Haywards, but without thought
ol their personal safety they immedi
ately ran down the stairs and con
fronted the man. He tried to make his
escape through a window when Soares

by a blow from the man's fist. He
then jumped through the window and

Charles N. Felton, Robert T. Devlin
and James H. Wilkins. who comprise a
majority of the prison board, are ready
to act on any proposition involving the
welfare of the institutions under con
trol of the directors.
Yesterday afternoon Governor Pardee
and Senator Felton had quite a talk
at the Palace Hotel. The Governor re
marked yesterday that he would be in
Sacramento to-day.
Don Ray, one of the members of the
prison board, is East. It Is an open
question whether Director R. M. Fitz
gerald will care to take up the burden
of an official Investigation. His term
of office as Prison Director expired last
January and since that time he has
plainly Indicated a desire that his suc
cessor should be appointed. There are
several applicants for the position, but
men who are next to the Governor in
cline to the opinion that the chief ex
ecutive has not found the right man for
the place.
There will be a meeting of the State
Board of Prison Directors at Folsom
to-day and topics concerning Warden
Tompkina' management of San Quen
tin Prison will be discussed. Reports
that an investigation may follow, with
a view of bettering conditions at the
San Quentin institution, seem to be
correct. Director Charles N. Felton
left the city for Folsom last evening.
Prior to his departure. he was asked
if the board had decided to investigate
the charge that cruelty in the use of
the straitjacket had been tolerated by
Warden Tompkins. Felton replied that
he was not authorized to speak for his
fellow directors, but felt justified in
saying that the board would consider
the subject mentioned. He indicated,
moreover, that the investigation would
be open and thorough, to the end that
all the facts connected with the pres
ent management of the priso.i may be
given to the public. Â¦. â¢*
Witnesses to the affair differ as to
what occurred at this juncture. The
Chinese aver that Mathews drew his
gun and declared he would get his
clothes. They say that he then shot
Tong In the . face without warning.
Mrs. Martinez maintains that she
opened her purse to pay the bill when
Tong seized a heavy stick of wood and
advanced in a menacing manner. Then
it was that her father drew his gun
and fired one shot.
The wounded man was conveyed to
the Central Emergency Hospital in an
ambulance. Emergency Surgeons Pink
ham and Stevens upon examination
found that the bullet entered the face
on the left side and lodged in the cheek
bone. It was subsequently removed by
Chief Surgeon J. I. Stephen and found
to be of thirty-eight caliber. The
wound, although serious, |ls not regard
ed as fatal.
During a dispute over a laundry bill
Toy Tong, an ironer employed by Sons
Lee. 616 Larkin street, was shot and se
riously wounded last night by A. Math
ews of 922 Ellis street. Mathews disap
peared after the shooting, but notified
the police that he would surrender him
self at the Hall of Justice. Up to a late
hour last night he had not been located
by the detectives.
The shooting occurred in the laundry
on Larkin street. According to the
story told by the Chinese in the place,
Mathews acted without any provoca
tion. Mrs. A. Martinez, a daughter of
Mathews, was present at the shooting
and says her father acted entirely in
self-de/ense.
From all that can be ascertained
Mathews, accompanied by several rela
tives, repaired to the laundry about
7:30 o'clock. Upon entering the place
he demanded that his laundry be given
to him. Toy Tons was in charge of the
place in the absence of the owner and
refused to comply with Mathews* de
mands. The Chinaman declared that
Mathews owed a considerable sum for
previous washing, and the laundry
would be withheld until a settlement
was made.
The pro-bond meeting which was to
have been held at the City Hall Park
to-night had to be abandoned owing to
the storm, but at a meeting of the
Progress Federation it was resolved
that rain or shine the meeting will be
held to-morrow night. A special band
will be in attendance and everything
done to make the affair a success.
The Rev. J. B. pastor of St.
Patrick's Church, has sent a letter- to
Mayor Warren Olney, indorsing the
bond project as a whole. Excerpts
from the communication follow:.
I believe the bonds will carry. It would be
a pity if they fall. It is impossible that there
could be property so near the heart of our
city as the Central Park elte not worth $1000
an acre. Of course we will have to pay an
additional $6 on every $1000 annually, at leaft
in the beginning, but it is a 'good Investment.
Thin is the place for our park. A thousand
dollars an acre does not seem exorbitant. A
lower price would Invite suspicion that there
was something wrong somewhere. % -
I myself am pleased and fully satisfied. I
shall vote for every one of the bonds without
exception. I cannot think of Oakland going
backward. Let us overlook seeming defects
and reach out for the substance. We cannot
fail to be convinced when we read the re
ports of our . best citizens, and reports, too,
of ackuowledged experts, all in absolute favor
and recommendation, with hardly a difference
of opinion. I am very anxious- to have our
city open up and expand.
I want to see plenty of employment for the
workers. Dare to do the big thing and do
It so that you cannot fall. I wish to let my
fellow-citiiens know that I Join in chorus
with you, Mr. Mayor, and all our zealous citi
zens. My motto is: "Go ahead on Tuesday
and vote for all the bonds."

To show their absolute faith in the
worth of the Sather tract, for park
purposes, as specified in the ordinance
calling the bond election, and their
utter disbelief of Assessor Dalton's
statement that the tract is^worth only
from 75 cents to $150 per acre, instead
of the amount the city Is asked to pay,
the Oakland Real Estate Association
has made a formal offer to pay five
times $150 per acre for land situated the
same distance as the Central Park
tract from the City Hall.
A certified check for $10,000 was
placed in the hands of Sol Kahn to
day as a guarantee of the associa
tion's good faith and its ability to carry
out its proposal. The association is
composed of the prominent real estate
dealers of the city. Their formal offer
is as follows: <.
OAKLAND. Cal.. September 22, 1904.
To Henry Dalton, Henry Rogers, A. D. Pryal
and others: You have asserted that the land
proposed to be purchafted by the city for a
park to be known aa Central Park Is worth
but 75 cents to 9150 per acre.
For every acre of land that you will bring
to us within the same distance that the cen
ter of this tract is from the City Hall we
will pay you five times your maximum ap
praisement, viz. : the sum of $750. We make
no further conditions other than the title
shall be perfect. The land may be in a gulch
or on top of a hill, on a steep hillside covered
with underbrush, barren, or In a marsh. It
may be suitable for - a park, residence Kites
or any other purpose, and a living stream
running through it would not be objection
able.
Herewith we have placed in Mr. Sol Kahn'e
hands a certified check for $10,000. and we
hereby authorize Mr. Sol Kahn, as our agent,
to enter Into agreements to purchase from you
each and every acre that you may offer him
under these condltiona up to the extent of
$100,000, and he is further authorized to em
ploy the aforesaid check in making deposits
to bind such agreements. Yours truly,

Professor Shaw declares that after
a careful study of the conditions ob
taining in the manufacture of oil he
cannot recomm'end in any way the at
tempt to handle olives for oil on a
small scale in connection with the or
chard, where the idea is to make oil
in a commercial way. The cost of ma
chinery, the extreme care necessary
in making a marketable oil and the
necessity for creating a market should
deter those with small capital from go
ing into the business of making oil
alone for profit.
To make oil at a coat that will compete
with Europe It is essential that only the most
efficient machines be used In the mills and
tbat these be of such capacity as to handle
large quantities of olives in â¢ the most eco
nomical manner. Under favorable conditions
we may reasonable expect the olive Industry,
when coupled with pickling, to give reasonable
returns upon the Investment.
There is a market demand for a high-grade,
untainted oil and It will not tolerate anything
less than this. There are those who at first
put up good products, but who have cone out
of the business slfnply because, in spite of the
llr.est Kind of Olive varieties and machinery,
they neglected the most elementary precau
tions and spoiled otherwise perfect raw ma
terial. The market is invariably blamed, but
In this case it Is not the guilty party.
The contrast in these figures â Eu
rope's millions against California's
thousandsâ Professor Shaw finds is due
to a number of reasons, though, as al
ready intimated, the chief of these is
the inferior quality of oil produced.
Varieties of olives unadapted to oil
making on account of the quality or
the quantity of oil furnished is one
reason for California's setback and
competition with the cheaper cotton
seed oil is another.
Professor Shaw does not set much
store on the fact that European labor
is cheaper than In this country. This
can be more than offset, he believes,
by machinery and improved-, methods
of handling the product Â¦ of the or
chards. On this point he says:
There Is money in olive oil in Cali
fornia if manufacturers will only be
skillful and economical, says Professor
George W. Shaw of the agricultural
department in a bulletin issued at the
University of California to-day. ,The
conditions are right and the market
Is there, but to be successful the in
dustry must be conducted with the ut
mest honesty and cleanliness. The
serious obstacles to success so far have
been the indifferent quality" of oil that
has been made by so many operators.
That there is a ready market in this
country for all the olive oil that could
be made In this State is evident from
the following: statement of thÂ« impor
tations of foreign oil In 1902:
Spain, $341,442; France, $940,318; Italy,
$1,041,277; Greece and Turkey, $10,974;
Portugal, $646; Austria, L$449. From
these countries for nine months end
ing March 31. 1903, $1,314,676. Califor
nia production for that period, $150,
000.

The California clipper Henry Hyde evidently
has a hoodoo setting 1 up aloft piloting the
ship. She has gone ashore the tiecond time
near Cape Henry, on the Virginia coast. When
she first struck the beach she was being- towed
from Baltimore to New York by one of the
Baker-Whitney tugs. The owners turned the
bhip over to the underwriters and began suit
against the towboat company on the ground
that the Hyde waÂ« lost through negligence
of thÂ« tue's captain. She was sold by the
underwriters to a wrecking company, which
floated her. but yesterday she went ashore
again through the breaking of a hawser dur
ing a heavy gale, and is probably a total
loss. The Hyde Is a fine ship o*f 2450 tons
register, and was built at Bath, Maine, In
lSh4.

Postal Inspector James O'Connell is
on the track of a daring crook who
has been operating in this city. San
Jose and Berkeley during: the last few
weeks. The man Is in the habit of
purchasing a money order for a small
sum, raising the amount, generally to
$25 and then passing it on some un
suspecting merchant.
The crook turned his first trick at
the South Berkeley postoffice on Sep
tember 3, when he got a money .order
signed by C. II. Howard and drawn
on J. A. Baum of this city for 50
cents. He raised the amount to $25
and passed the bogus order on T. F.
Baumeister, a grocer at 1901 Howard
street, on September 9. He was
later heard from in San Jose, then
again in Berkeley and again in this
city.
The total amount of the fellow's
stealings will reach about J200. He
generally secures an order for 50 cents
and by a chemical process erases the
amount and sometimes the names.
In all he has worked no less than
seven of these bogus orders. He is
described as being afout 30 years old.
dark hair and mustache and well
dressed. Inspector O'Connell hopes to
apprehend the crook soon and believes
he is at present working his way up
north, possibly through Sacramento.

September 23. 1904.
The Time Ball on the tower of the Ferry
bul'dins was dropped exactly at noon to-day â
1 e , at noon of tbe 120th meridian, or at
8 P m. Greenwich time. J. C. BURNETT.
Lieutenant. U. S. N.. In charge.
Before the hearing closed an informal
discussion was had. Mayor Schmitz
made the statement that the Cigar
makers* Union should have had better
premises 1 on which to base such
serious allegations against Commis
sioner Drinkhouse. To the executive
the fact that Drinkhouse has only 366
saloons as customers out of a total of
over 3000 was proof conclusive that no
intimidation or improper influence was
being used by Commissioner Drink
house.
C. B. Sweeney, saloon-keeper at 1300
Folsom street, does not buy and never
has bought cigars from Drinkhouse, ac
cording to his testimony. He declared
that the statement accredited to him
by a witness for the cigarmakers that
he had said he was forced to patronize
the Police Commissioner because of
favors shown was unfounded. m
Police Commissioner Drinkhouse took
the stand in his own behalf and testi
fied as follows:
According to the llcens* records there are
over 3000 saloons In Sari Francisco and of
these only 36B are on my books as customers.
Before I became a Commissioner those patron
izing me numbered 13".
My Instructions to my salesmen have always
bÂ«en that they must make no reference to 'the
Police Commission. I have used no intimida
tion to build up trade, nor have my salesmen
ever done m>.
I never told Edward Horn or any one else
that 1 was compelled to buy clgara from
Police Commissioner Trlnkhouse.
Mr. Drinkhouse has never solicited any busi
ness from mo nor have any of his salesmen
ever approached me. I purchased clears from
him of my own voHticn. I went to Mr. Drink
house's office In May and grave him my first
order. That was a month before ray llcen&Â»
was revoked.
The hearing before Mayor Schmitx
of the charges against Police Commis
sioner Drinkhouse by the Cigarmakers'
Union was concluded yesterday and in
the course of his comments the execu
tive declared that the allegations had
net been substantiated.
"We couldn't get the witnesses- to
come forward and therefore failed to
deliver the goods," was the way the
case was summed up by Nick Blum,
the leader of the cigarmakers. The
Mayor announced that he would render
his decision next Tuesday.
Several saloon-keepers were exam
ined yesterday whose names had been
given to the Mayor the day before as
having been intimidated by Drink
house's agents. On the stand these
witnesses all testified that the Police
Commissioner had neyer attempted un
due influence or intimidation.
The first of the saloon-keepers called
was Ludwlg rfJusse, whose place of
business is on Howard street and who
was credited at Thursday's hearing by
Edward Horn with the statement that
he "had to buy his cigars from Drink
house." His testimony 'was as fol
lows:
Wyman is ordered to appear In Judge
Cabaniss' court to-day at 10 a. m. The
presence of McMenomy, the mysterious,
is also ordered. Commissioner Maes
tretti has promised that the man will
appear.
Judge Cabaniss was asked to take
charge of the documents offered in evi
dence, but decMned, on the ground that
he was not sure be had jurisdiction to
do so. He indorsed the evidence with
his signature.
Wright and Hosmer and Fairfax
Wheelan were not fooled by the double.
Xeitht-r was Deteotive M- J. Bulger of
<_"T:rtin'5 agency, who -was employed to
gather evidence for the prosecution.
Commissioner Maestretti says that the
pscudo Wyman's name is McMenomy,
but clainos to know nothing else about
him. He has been seated beside the
Commissioner during the two hearings.
Linle was accomplished at the hear
ing yesterday. Attorney Countryman
for the defense objected to every item
of evidence offered by the prosecution.
He objected to the designation Seven
ty-third Primary Election District, and
objected to the abbreviation "TL" for
Republican, "D." for Democrat, etc He
objected to all the records and affida
vits brought ' forward by George P.
Adams, secretary of the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners, and he objected to
the primary election proclamation. J.
Harry Zemansky, deputy registrar of
voters, was also called to testify as to
the qualifications of the officers in
charge of the booth where Wyman is
alleged to have cast an illegal vote. His
evidence was also objected to. Judge
Cabaniss overruled all these objections.
Shortly after a o'clock the court ap
pointed Tuesday at 2 p. m. for the next
hearing. Attorney Hosmer then asked
if the defendant were in court. Then
the fact of the double's presence was
revealed.
Hosxner and Wright, attorneys for
th*- croEocution. denied this, as did
Ffeirfax Wheelan. On inQuiry it was
found that Wyman had remained, at
any rate, almost to the time of ad
journment. If not until the exnet mo
menu
and Fairfax "Wheelan. I want, the man
charged with contempt."
"Was the defendant in the room until
the time of adjournment?" inquired
Jud^re Cabaniss.
TU swear that he was." said Com
n-r^sioner Maestrciti. 'lie left just
after your Honor said Tuesday, 2
o'clock.' "
"Tne man has been here for two
days." exclaimed Attorney Wright for
t^<? prosecution. "At the last hearing 1
saw Attorney Countryman point in his
direction when hÂ» spoke of the defend
ant. It's a. trick to deceive this court

After Slow Session in the

the *\RiiiÂ£<?r" Is iteveaJed
Explains He Could Not Make
Good Because Witnesses
Feared to Come Forward
At Shanghai the officers of the Gaelic
saw the Russian cruisers Askold and
Gromoboi lying dismantled in the har
bor. Both vessels show the fearful or
deal they pas&ed through in their run
for a place of refuge. Great shot holes
are in their sides, partly below the
water line and the smokestacks are
riddled. They are literally wrecks.
The Gaelic sailed from Hongkong
August 26: Amoy. August 28; Shanghai,
August 30: Nagasaki. September 1;
Kobe, September 3; 'Yokohama, Sep
tember 6, and Honolulu, September 15.
Her cabin passengers are: A. W.
Buschendorff, C. B. Franklin and wife,
Mrs. E. Gowan, Mrs. L. L. Ormsby,
Miss M. X. Stubbs, Mrs. M. C. L. Sher
wood, H. T. Wilgress, Mrs. P. T. Car
rington. R. Carrington, D. B. Fullerton,
Victor Marsh. J. D. Sloan, John B.
Steel and Captain A. E. Wilson.
After one more round trip for the
Gaelic she will return to Hongkong
and bid good-by to the Pacific, pos-
Fibly forever. She will go back to Eng
land and her White Star owners will
probably dispose of her to some minor
steamship company, as she is too old
and out-of-date for Atlantic passenger
work. There have been rumors of the
"White Star steamship Majestic's com
ing here to take the Gaelic's place, but
steamship men do not think this prob
able. The splendid Majestic principal
ly intended for passengers, would have
to be changed for freight accommoda
tion and other alterations would have
to be made which would be too costly
fc-r the traffic
On the ' outward trip, while crossing
the Yellow Sea. the Gaelic sighted a
Russian cruiser steering northward.
From the peculiar location of her three
funnels she was easily recognized as
the NavUc Though the Gaelic was in
plain view the ltussian did not stop,
but hurried on her course. At Shanghai
the incident was reported and it was
learned that the Novik's indifference
to the rich prize that was hers for the
taking- was due to the fact that she
herself was seeking safety from the
pursuing Japanese â a safety she never
found, as her shot-riddled hull lying
boached on the Chinese coast will tes
tify. The information given by the
Gaelic concerning the Nuvik was sent
to the Japanese naval commander and
possibly the liner thus contributed to
the Xovik's end.

of the limit, as provfded in the laws of

ANSWERS.
HP* HE Sunday Call Magazine to-morrow will make its appear
j ance in an artistic front page, "The Old Oak," a pencil drawing
- * by Eloise Roorbach, portraying a bit of lowland picturesque
ness familiar to residents of all of those 'bay shore counties where
the white oak is found, rearing its venerable, gaunt ruggedness
boldly against the sky. In fiction and- in features of timelv
interest the edition will be unusually strong. The serial "Anna the
Adventurers" runs through its third installment. This novel will
be completed October 2, and October 9 will begin "The
Grafter?," a political story by Francis Lynde, which has already
been extensively commented upon by Eastern reviewers. It is a
book with plenty of vim and vigor and throws many an interesting
sidelight upon the political game.
"A Vital Point of Education" affords Marie Corelli scope for
one of her keen and caustic pages of comment on one of the
biggest questions of the day, the general tendency to "skim" in
reading. Edward \Y. Townsend takes his country hero through
the" first (and last) steps of a political campaign and leaves him
as usual richer in experience than in pocket. Ray Stannard Baker,
whose name is familiar to all readers of McClure's, contributes a
virile tale of those who work in the depths of mines,, in "At the
Tunnel's End"; G. B. Burgin has "A Batch of Love Letters";
there are three short stories, "Breaking the Record" by Jeanne'
Caldwell, "The Tempting of Adam" by Keith Gordon, "Without
Antecedents" by Otho B. Senga; a fable, "Good Xames Made to
Order"; a page of "Meows" by Kate Thyson Marr, and briefer
articles.
In the women's department there 13 a page by Augusta Pres
cott on the very "latest fall hats, and a page of simple physical

Hans moved his hoof eleven timesâ
and so it was. Twenty minutes later j
the watch was shown to him again and-i
now he stamped first eleven and, after
a short pause, twenty times more. He
then answered correctly the following
questions, the watch not being pro

But Hans can do even better. He
can read. You put' down your ques
tion in writingyand Hans will answer
it just as-correctly after having thrown
a knowing look at the paper. You press
the bntton of your automatic pencil
and Hans does the rest. Again from
his look and from his quickness in an
swering questions it is easily to be
seen that the rows of letters produce
in his brain (or whatever yon may call
his thinking apparatus) the same men
tal functions as in the brain of a bright
boy of twelve or thirteen. The identi
cal conclusion must be received from
the fact that Hans is capable of spell
ingâafter a system Invented by Herr
von Ostenâ the words written down for
that purpose. You put down a word
on a slip of paper, let Hans take a
good look at It and Hans will resort to
a frame covered with movable letters
which is placed in the courtyard, and
pick out the proper letters.

fifth part of 45?" "How much is 2, 3, 5.
6, raised to the square?" "Through
how many numbers can 24, 33, 36, etc.,
be divided?" "Give us the third, fourth,
fifth, etc., of those numbers."
One of the onlookers asked Hans: "I
have eight plums in a bag. Two chil
dren come along and I make them a
present of these plums, even shares.
How much did each of them get?"
"Look here, Hans, I have a certain
number in my mind: I deduct from it
nine and I retain three. Which was
my number?" And Hans answers all
and every question in his self-reliant
way, as if it were the most natural
thing for a horse to take a lesson in
higher arithmetic every morning to
gether with his breakfast hay.
"Der Kluce Hans" (Smart : Johnny )
HANS' MASTER.
Serious and close observers of -na
ture .have described acts of _ punish
ment* dealt out by animals to ,each
other. The cat will box her kittens
when they play too long with her tail,
and the mother hen will separate her
chickens when the"y get Into a. fight,
and sometimes peck one or both of
them on the head, as much as to say,
"There, don't you do that 'again." This
is only a small selection from hun
dreds of well I authenticated "cases
tending to prove that some animals
are endowed with some degree of in
telligent thinking. But the moat forc
ible proof of this much' discussed the
ory is being furnished just now In one
of the northern districts of Berlin,
where the much talked; of "thinking
horse" is performing marvelous feats
of intelligence in the ' presence of
thousands of spectators. "
It is not a little curious that mod
ern science is doing much to upset
this view of the animal world so flat
tering to man's self-conceit. Closer
and wiser observation of the habits of
animals is bringing to light here and
there indications of a degree of con
scious intelligence which may well
put to shame the so-called rationality
of many members of our own species.
The doctrines of evolution plainly
suggest that in animals are to be
found the germs of mental qualities
previously supposed to be man's ex
clusive possession. Darwiri has taught
us, for Instance, that certain birds dis
play a considerable amount of taste
and skill in the matter of decorative
coloring and it is a well known fact
that many animals manifest a strik
ing delight in music.
BERLIN. Sept. 2.â There is a
growinc tendency to credit ani
mals of all kinds with moral
and intellectual qualities like those of
human beings. In the infancy of the
race men were accustomed to think
of anim- "-. as almost on a level with
themselves in all kinds of intellectual
and moral capacity. And children re
flect this condition of mind in imag
ing their pet animals to be capable of
understanding all their thoughts and
wishes. The whole class of fables and
children's stories illustrates this naive
condition of the early human fancy.
The uncivilized man and the child
find no difficulty in conceiving their
familiar quadrupeds talking, behaving
and eating in quite human fashion.
As the race grew in intelligence it be
gan to think of the lower creation as
further removed. from itself. Proud
of its attainments, it arrogated to it
self the exclusive possession of re
flection, reason and voluntary choice.
The final expression of this disposi
tion was the philosophic doctrine* of
Descartes that animals are without
souls and consciousness, their seem
ingly intelligent actions being simply
the result of a nicely contrived piece
of bodily mechanism ,of habit and
training.

FOR a long time California has been inattentive to forestry
legislation and administration. This condition is all the more
remarkable because this State has some of the finest and most
valuable forests in the world. Owners of these timber lands have
been impressed with the necessity for their preservation and
permanence, while the State has made no sign in that direction.
The owners of great redwood forests in Humboldt County at
their own expense procured the service of foresters, through Mr.
Gifford Pinchot, to arrange cutting plans and the timber harvest,
so as to preserve the growing trees and make the forest a perma
nent producer. The Diamond Match Company has done the same
on its timber land in the Sierras, and other owners have made a
forest law unto themselves. These favored tracts, under such
appreciative ownership, are far apart and few. The most of the
forest is left without either private or public protection. . Its
destruction by fire progresses rapidly in every dry season and the
mountains are losing their covering and their capacity as con
servators of moisture.
It is time that the State do something. It owns in the Red
wood Park in the Big Basin the finest public forest in the world.
That park is surrounded by forest over which the State has no
ownership control. It is subject to conflagration and within the
last month part of it has been swept clean by fire that entered
the State park and came near destroying it. The only control of
the surrounding forests and of all the private timber lands that
ihe State can assert must be by statutes, under its right of police
regulation. Various forestry clubs and other organizations have
vainly urged such legislation for many years. The usual answer
of the average legislator is, "Draw up a bill. I don't know anything
about it." As there has been no concert of action the matter has
been passed over and the fires have been licensed to destroy that
which is necessary to the whole life of the State.
The Federal Government is a large forest owner in California,
in the various national parks and forest reserves. It can regulate
forest administration within its own holdings, but has no jurisdic
tion outside. That belongs to the State. As the State does noth
ing and the control of the Federal forests is in the hands of the
army, and very deficient and ineffective, our forests may be said
to be all outlawed, except in those portions under intelligent and
far-seeing private control. The Federal Bureau of Forestry, 'which
is part of the Agricultural Department, ought to have control of
all the Federal forests. It is doing now and has* been doing in
the past all that can be done for the advancement of intelligent,
conservative and scientific forestry, but it is an alien in the juris
diction of the Interior and War departments and of the State.
Three members of the bureau â Messrs. Sterling, Hodge and
Sherrard â have been in the State some time, called here by Gov
ernor Pardee to examine the Yosemite Valley and the Redwood
Park and other forests, in order that they may advise the State
what to do to arrest the destruction of the timber-covered lands.
They recommend that the underscrub in Yosemite Valley be cleared
away, as an improvement in the appearance of the valley and a
safeguard against fire. Upon the general subject they are preparing
a code of forest laws for submission to the next Legislature. This
is very important work. The forestry clubs should undertake to
urge upon the Legislature the adoption of this code. It fills the
want that heretofore has seemed to excuse the indifference of the
State. If the Legislature will pass wise laws and if Congress will
turn all the Federal forests over to the Forestry Bureau, where they
belong, we will have the effective concurrence of two civil juris
dictions for the benefit of the forests. At present the Federal
forests are under military jurisdiction, which is not easily con
tinent with civil jurisdiction, as any one may learn by reading the
reports of the military superintendents.
On the 30th of this month the State Sempervirens Club holds
a great meeting in San Jose. This is one of the largest forest
clubs in California. It was greatly instrumental in securing the
purchase of the Redwood Park. The object of its meeting is to
promote the construction of a good State road into that park, from
the summit of Castle Rock ridge, above Saratoga, from which
point to the park would be a four hours' drive. This is a worthy
project and deserves promotion. The interest in it will call out
a large meeting. We suggest that when gathered there the club
also give attention to State forestry laws as a means of preserving
the Redwood Park and all other forests from destruction. Roads
to the primeval forest are very necessary and desirable, but they
will be of little use if fire destroy the object for which they are
built.

One of the odd characters of the
State of California died last Wednes
day in the San FranciBco City and
County Hospital at the age of SI years.
He was registered at that institution aa
William Wirth, but he was recognized
as L. A. Barnes, who was generally
known in the northern mines in the
early days as "Old Bach." In the cele
bration of Admission day in 1900 in this
city, forty-one years after his arrival
in this State, he was one of the attrac
tive features of the procession of Na
tive Sons, being attired just as he was
when he reached Sacramento May 2,
1850, after having crossed the plains
from Chicago afoot. On his back he
carried his cooking utensils and such
implements as were necessary when he
should reach the Golden State. "Old
Bach" did not remain long In Sacra
mento, but, in the language of the early
Californians, he "put out for rich dig
gings." He was of a roaming disposi
tion, 'so did not remain long In any one
place to seek for. gold, but struck a
pocket here and there, then moved to
other diggings, and he worked the
ground in almost every mining camp
in Northern and Middle California.
In a burst of confidence "Old Bach"
once told some companions who jok
ingly asked why he did not marry that
he intended to when he got to be old
enough, he being at that time more
than 60 years of age. . From remarks he
then made it was discovered that he
had become a confirmed bachelor be
cause of a love that was lost in his na
tive State, New York. This much he
told, but never more, and nothing could
induce. him to tell the romance of his
early life. For many years, after the
rush from mining^ camp to mining
camp, he settled down in a small cabin
near the natural bridge in the vicinity
of Murphys Camp, Calaveras County,
and there lived the life of a hermit.
There were In this city some who knew
him In the long ago, and not wishing
to see his remains placed in the Pot
ter's field had his body taken to the
undertaking parlors of Valente. Marini
& Co.. and while arrangements were
being made to give him decent sepul
cher it was discovered that he had been
a soldier in one of the United States
wars, and this being brought to the at
tention of those who are interested in
old soldiers of the Union it was decided
to lay his body at final rest In the na
tional cemetery at the Presidio, possi
bly to-morrow. It was announced yes
terday that his remains will be attired
in the kind of clothing he always wore
in the mines â a miner's garb.

None of the occupants had left their

breakfast table when the crash came.
I-irpe filate glass mirrors in the cars
were broken an were also several of
ihÂ«Â« brÂ«Â»aKfast dishes. Morgan was
nidd^nly thrown forwurd, but was not

Mtf. Davidson and Mr. Morgan, were

and attendants. It was rumored that
-t maid was hurt, but her injuries were
i "t Kftoos. Traffic on the road was
Â»>l<if kÂ«d fur a time.
The special train was one engaged by
Morgan on behaJf of the Archbishop
and was In charge of Conductor John
Fox (.f Worcester, and Engineer John
Lord of that city.
Immediately it was realized that
the life ol the Archbishop and Mrs.
Davidson, as well as of others attend-
i f ;(r them, had been imperiled and first
inquiries were for them. Rev. J. Elli

EAST BROOKFIELD, Mass., Sept.
23. â A special train conveying the
Archbishop of Canterbury from Bar
Harbor. Me., to .Washington, was
Â¦wrecked on the Boston and Albany di
vision of the New York Central Rail
road near the station here to-day. The
Archbishop was not injured, although
< shaken up. J. Pierpont
Morgaji of New York, who was also on
the train accompanying the Archbish
o;>. was shaken but not hurt.
The special, running at the rate of
tixty miles an hour, nas passing the
nation when a detached locomotive,
v.-hich had been drawing a train on the
North Brookfielfl branch, ran on to the
main line for some reason at present
unexplained. The engineer of the spe
<-ial sighted the light engine, but owing
to the high speed and slippery rail?,
found it impossible to more than
elightly reduce the speed of his loco
motive. The engineer ol the branch
engine heard the onrush of the special,
but had not time to move out of the
â¢vay. The Archbishop's train struck
the Xcrth Brookfield engine with a.
lerrific crash and demolished it.
At the conclusion of the evidence
Judge Hunt asked Schilling if he had
anything to say. The lawyer started
to argue that the hearing was only
preliminary on the question of a
change to some other court. Judee
Hunt ruled him out. Then Schilling
said that he had put in a demurrer.
This the court promptly overruled.
Then the Judge asked him if he was
prepared to pay Mrs. Smith $20 out of
the $30 he had received.
"I certainly will not give it to her,"
replied Schilling, hotly. "She gave it
to me for our fees under the contract
and I am going to keep it."
"Don't be hasty," said the court. "I
don't want to be hard on you. I will
give you until next Tuesday to think
it over."
"As far as I am concerned," retorted
the thoroughly angry attorney, "you
can decide it now. I will not change
my mind on Tuesday'."
"Well, since you challenge me for a
decisic-n." said Judge Hunt, "I will or
der that you be suspended from the
practice of your profession until you
pay the woman."
Schilling was silent. After a brief
pause the court said: "I withdraw that
and* advise you to consult with Mr.
Schmitt."
"That's kind of you," remarked Schil
ling, "but I don't think I will."
Then Schmitt made the motion that
deferred the order until Monday.
Schilling testified in his own behalf,
admitting that Smith had paid him $30
on the judgment in the divorce case.
Schilling giving a receipt. He said that
Smith had declared he did not care
whether the money went toward pay
ing the alimony or attorney's fee. Then
Schmitt Â£/d Schilling agreed that it
would be' well for them to apply $20
toward the expenses they had incurred
in the case and give Mrs. Smith $10.
Mrs. Smith, learning that the $30 had
been paid, called on Schilling and he
toid her what had been done. She de
clined to accept $10 and said if it was
not all paid for alimony the attorneys
could keep it for fees and she would
get the alimony out of the balance' due.
The witness said his client professed
to be satisfied with the arrangement.
Judge Hunt and Coogan tried to
question Schilling as to the expenses
alleged to have been incurred in the
case, but the witness objected to all
the questions of the court ,as "incom
petent." He was advised to answer
and U was learned that he had served
summons himself and others were
served by Mrs. Smith's brother, for
which the latter did not charge. Attor
neys Schmitt and Diviny and Miss
Grace Wright, Schilling's stenographer,
substantially corroborated his story of
the transactions.
Andrew Smith gave his version and
said that Schilling asked him to pay
the money, representing that Mrs.
Smith was "hard up" and starving.
The husband said he had paid it as
alimony and in a hot passage with the
lawyer told Schilling it was a shame
that he should take the money from a
poor woman. "Pay it to her now, If
you've got it," shouted the husband.
Mrs. Smith then took the stand. She
had gone to Schilling's office, she tes
tified, to get the money and he told her
it had been paid, but "he guessed he
had better keep It for fees." She told
the court that she had no money.
JUDGE RULES HLM OUT.
For a half minute yesterday after
noon Attorney Frank Schilling was
suspended from the practice of his pro
fession by the judicial order ut Judge
Hunt. Then the Superior Judge with
drew his ruling and advised Schilling
to f a little deep thought to his pre
dicament and in the meantime to con
sult Attorney M. L. Schmitt, who was
associated with Schilling in the Dina
Smith divorce case, cut of which the
trouble grew. Schilling was not in a
mood fcrr consultation, but Schmitt
made a motion that the Judge with
hold his order until Monday and the
stay was granted.
The hearing involving Schilling's pro
fessional standing occupied two hours
of Judge Hunt's time yesterday and
there were several exciting moments.
Schilling and Schmitt had prosecuted
two unsuccessful divorce suits for Dina
Smith against Andrew Smith, a livery
man. In the last action Judge Hunt
ordered Smith to pay 575 for his wife's
attorney fees and $45 a month main
tenance. Mrs. Smith charged that
Schilling had received $30 from her hus
band on account of alimony due, but
had kept it for counsel fees. On hear
ing this Judge Hunt caused her to
make an affidavit setting forth the al
leged facts. Schilling denied the
charges and asked that the hearing be
had befuTe some other Judge. Judge
Hunt said he would not call in a broth
er Judge to determine whether or not
the lawyer had withheld from the
woman money belonging to her."
When the hearing began, T. M.
Diviny, Schilling's partner, moved a
dismissal of the proceedings, which was
denied. T. C. Coogan conducted the
case against the lawyer.
SCHILLING'S VERSION.
Passengers continually claim that they are
required tr> declare only dutiable goods and that
no requirement 1 of declaration of articles is to
be made where the same does not exceed $100
in value. These Â¦ contentions are entirely in
correct. AH foreign purchased or acquired
articles must be set forth specifically. The
matter of exemption and dut lability is one to
be passed upon by the proper customs official.
Where pagaengers declare, as they continu
ally do, that they cannot recall their pur
chases, nor do they know what their trunks
contain, you will refuse to accept declarations
from such. Passengers who are not sufficiently
advised aÂ« to what their trunks contain will
be obliged to go "through, their baggage pre
liminarily to ascertain the requisite facts.
It is my wish that this matter should be,
with extreme courtesy and yet clearly, brought
to the attention of each passenger who makes
a declaration, so that there will be no mis
understanding regardlnsr the subject. In fact,
there ought to be none such, since the circular
issued by the department February 1, 1004,
and In the hands of each passenger, clearly
cÂ«vers the subject.
Returning passengers have only the. advan
tage of this exemption by declaring goads pur
chased or acquired abroad and having the mat
ter of exemption passed upon by the acting
Deputy Collector at the pier. Goods foreign
purchased and not declared, whether within
the exemption allowed by law or. not. are sub
ject to forfeiture and seizure. The
at Washington can alone afford relief in such
cases. Further, examination cannot be made
of passenger's effects until the declaration has
been completed. When finally executed, it
cannot thereafter be changed, nor additions
made to the list of dutiable articles.
Customs Collector Stratton has Is
sued strict instructions with^ reference
to the taking of declarations of pas
sengers as to their baggage. Passen
gers who fail to acquaint themselves
with the contents of their baggage and
the prices paid for such articles as may
be purchased abroad will be in danger
of losing such articles in addition to
being fined three times the value of
the goods. The instructions follow:
Instructions from the Secretary of the Treas
ury, dated August 4, 1004, roilowlng the de
cision of Judge de Haven In the case of the
United States vs. W. H. Harts, arain direct
that all foreign purchased or acquired articles
must be declared by returning passengers In
their baggage declarations In order to entitle
them to the $100 exemption, or any part
thereof. ,
In addition to the funerals that are
announced ! for "Sunday, there will be
memorial services in the three churches
of the village.
Reports- about the floors of the out
house having given way last year are
denied by" the School Trustees. They
'say the floors were repaired during the
summer vacation and nothing wrong
was noticed with the girders.. Janitor
Smith, however, asserts that he had
told members of the board that the
place was not safe.
Coroner Weaver had the wrecked
girders preserved. It is said that the
timbers were found to be rotten and
that one of them was spliced. The
girders will be brought to Cincinnati
to-morrow for examination at the in
quest.
Joseph Steinkamp, when his daughter
was not among those brought out alive,
entered the vault and carried out sev
eral bodies, nnioqg them that of his
daughter. Then he collapsed. At the
same time there were other parents in
the waiting crowd that fainted when it
was announced that all of the living
had" been rescued and their children
were still missing.
The frame shed over the sewer was
about twenty feet square, without win
dows, and had only one narrow door
way, so that only one girl escaped fall
ing. She ran into the school building
and told the teachers what had oc
curred. Principal Zimmerman j and
seven female teachers ran to the res
cue. Principal Zimmerman secured a
ladder, on which the girls climbed out,
most of them fainting as soon as they
reached the surface, overcome by
fright and sewer gas.
The teachers were soon reinforced by
the entire population of the suburb,
the police and fire departments ren
dering effective service. â¢
Principal Zimmerman finally fainted.
Then others lifted out dead bodies until
the deathpool cleared. Those res
cued alive presented such an appear
ance as to make many in the crowd of
spectators faint.
James Smith, aged 14, a pupil,
climbed to the roof of the schoolhouse
and got the flag, which was made Into
a rope that rescued several.

Came a liard Knock From Coffee.
It's a Pimple matter to satisfy sen-
Fible, thinking people by a ten days'
trial of Postum in place of coffee, for
if ft is coffee causes the Illness, an
almost immediate cl?ange takes place.
The old coffee ails, sluggishness, in-
somnia, lack of energy, stomach
troubles, sallow ekin, headaches and
all the ethers, whatsoever form the
nerves decide upon when they are
thrown out of balance by coffee, be-
gin to leave and it's only a question of
Â¦ short time when Postum will end
them all and bring back health.
"I had drunk coffee every morning
:r. and out of season until two years
ago. when all of a oudden my stomach
r^bfllfd and shortly thereafter I be-
came a nervous wreck, couldn't eat a
b:te without intense suffering. I lost
m<>st all my flesh and was practically
Ktarving, because I couldn't get any
pood out of what little food I did eat
"One morning when In this wretch*
'"dly run down condition I read a
magazine article about Postum Food
Coffee and the case seemed so much
like mine I sent out and got a pack-
Age. At that time almost nothing
would stay on my stomach, but the
Jirst curÂ» of Postum wife made for me
s.-Â»med to warm and nourish me clear
to my finger tips and this delighted
rJow of well-fed feeling continued.
For the firtt five or six days the Pos-
tum was all I could keep on my
Mnmaoh or even take at all without
trreat pufOring. but I got better so '
fart 1 added other foods gradually and
k'pt paining strength and flesh until
DOW I can rat a hearty meal and really
enjoy life once more. I know ft was
Poptum that saved me from .starving
to dÂ°ath when my stomach had been ;
ruined by coffee.

Cannot "Fertilize'* Contest.
Judge Coffey yesterday sustained
the demurrer to the complaint in the
contest against the will of Jeanette
Crabbe and grave Attorney Eastin ten
days in which to amend. Mrs. Crabbe
had lived for forty years as a servant
in the family of Charley Harley. Har
]ey died five years before Mrs.
Crabbe's will was made, but the con
testants allege that under the Influ
ence which he started Mrs. Crabbe
left all her estate to the Harleys ex
cepting $200. The defense demurred
to th* charge that a man^who had
been dead five years had Influenced the
making of n will, and Judge Coffey
Mid: "A man dead five years is good
for nothing but fertilizing, and you
cannot use him to fertilize a will con

GAELIC FOOTBALLERS
ON" PRESIDIO GROUNDS
Emeralds to Play a Challenge Match
Against a Combined Thistle and
Independent Team.
At the Presidio athletic grounds to
morrow a combined team of Thistle
and Independent footballers will play
a challenge match, under Gaelic rules,
against the Emerald team of the Cali
fornia Gaelic Athletic Association.
Both teams have been training hard
and promise to give a good account of
themselves.
The Thistles and Independents were
the strongest association football play
ers in California last season, the
Thistles winning the championship of
the league and the Independents cap
turing the Union cup. The Emerald
players are fast and an Interesting
struggle is expected. The ball will be
kicked off at 2:30 p. m. The Emerald
team will be made up of McMahon
(captain). Finn. Barry, Ryan, Sul
livan, Allen, McGuire, Foley. Rior
dah, O'Connor, Shaughnessy, O'Brien,
O'Rourke, Lyons, Devine, Cudahy and
Flynn.
The Independent-Thistle team will
consist of T. Fay (captain). Forbes,
Armstrong, T. Disher, A. Disher, R.
Taylor, *Duncanson. McGran, P. Fay,
EL Fay. McGregor, T. Lydon. J. Smith.
Balmain, Jones, Lloyd, J. Taylor and
Hunter.
The last championship tennis tour
nament of the year will be played to
morrow on the Golden Gate Park
courts. It will be the first champion
ship event ever played on the publio
courts and should be productive of
some clever tennis. It is to be an an
nual event for Ihe singles champion
ship of the bay counties. The tourna
ment will be open and it Is expected
pearly all of the cracks from both sides
of the bay will compete. Reuben H,
Lloyd has offered a handsome silver
loving cup, which must be won three
times. Owing to the unusually largo
entry it will take at least three Sun
days to determine who is to bo tno
first champion.
Champion MacGavin has entered thÂ«
competition, but will bÂ« out of town
and unable to play. This will be a dis
appointment to many, as he is playing
great tennis. Perc;* Murdock, the Ala
meda crack, will not compete, as ha
has announced his intention of retir
ing from tournament play. With these
two out of it the championship will in
all probability go to one of the follow
ing players: Will Allen, George Baker.
Clarence Griffln or R. N. Whitney.
Baker and Allen are the doubles cham
pions of the Coast and they are prob
ably the best players entered. Whitney
has taken a new lease of life and
stands a chance to win if he can last.
Young Griffin is improving rapidly and
may surprise the experts.
Herbert Long is another youngster
who is coming to the front rapidly and
will cut some figure In the tournament.
He does not play as well In tourna
ments as In practice, but he will prove
a Vhard man to beat.
The annual election of officers of ths
California Tennis Club will be held
next Saturday. The directors will meet
on Monday night to elect a nominat
ing committee. It Is not expected there
will be many changes. The officers now
serving will probably be re-elected. The
following ofllcers have served for the
past year: W. S. MacGavin. president
and treasurer; W. B. Collier, vice pres
ident: Grant M. Smith, secretary;
Frank S. Mitchell, Harry H. Haight.
Dr. Lovegrove and Dr. Noble, direc
tor?. kI9Â£
The delegates to the Pacific States
lAwn Tennis Association will hold
their annual meeting for the election
of officers in October.
The California Tennis Club will give
a banquet to-night In honor of J. D.
MacGavin, the new Coast champion. It
Is expected all the prominent tennis
men on both sides of the bay will at
tend.
The race for the directors* cups at
the California Club Is an Interesting
one. Long and Janes scored their sec
ond consecutive victory last Sunday,
and are tied with Schmidt and Rolf?.
It seems the trophien will go to one of
these two teams permanently.

Richardson, of course, is easily at the
head of the batting averages, with Jen
kins of Santa Cruz second and Petersen
third. Wilding was for some time sec
ond to Richardson on the list, but small
scores in the last two or three matches
have pulled him down. Jenkins' aver

tersen's has been much improved by
his score of 109 against the Pacific team

But One Important Event
Remains to Be Decided
on the Courts This Season
It looks as If Sperry, the best youth
the season has developed, will be neecl
ed to help the freshmen to victory. His
absence from the play against the
Berkeley High School last Wednesday
was noticeable; Weller was used for
the Stanford freshmen and varsity
last year, and no doubt Sperry will be
made to do double duty for California
if he continues .his excellent work.
Snowdon and Golcher promise much
as halfbacks, : Siiowdon particularly.
Twltchell seems to be well placed at
full. Kendall is good at quarter and
seems to keeu his head, as all good
quarters do. %
Snedigar wrenched his knee in prac
tice and will be out â¢ of the game for
some time. Kern is also laid up with
an injured ankle. I .Â¦.Â¦'â¢, /
In the two frames the freshmen
played they put : up a ragged article.
They cannot be iexpected to make
much of a showing this early, however,
and as the season advances they will
naturally Improve* Certainly, there is
enough good material on hand to man
ufacture a first-rate eleven.
BERKELEY, Sept. 23.â It will take
the game to-morrow against the Olym
pics to show what kind of an eleven
California will put in the football arena
this season. There has been but little
chance to size up the men so far, be
cause they have not been tried out
against any other team. The atmos
phere Is always cleared after the first
game, and so the fans will have to wait
until the whistle sounds at the end of
the second half before any one will
know how good or how bad are Califor
nia's chances.
There are those who think California
will suffer the same fate as Stanford
last Saturday at the hands of that
husky Olympic crowd. California has
not struck its gait by any means yet,
and the play is more than likely to be
a bit wobbly.
The first line-up will be something
like this: Stroud, center; Stern, right
guard; Gray, left guard; Force, right
tackle; Howard, left tackle; Oliver,
right end; Henry, left end; Kittrelle,
quarter; Sperry, light half; White, left
half; Lafater, ful5.
This is the teaj'h thariooks the best
to the spectators^ although others will
be given a chance;by the coaches. When
changes are mad<j Mead, White, Evans
and Anloff will be; tried as backs, Lasa
ter and Boyntori a< full, Boothe at
quarter, O'Toole and Reed at guard,
and Elliott, Caminetti and Coogan at
end. Â¦ -
Tomasini, the big freshman from Palo
Alto, is doing well at guard on thÂ»
varsity. He is heavy, uses his head
well, and is a hard man to stop. Be
sides | this Jhe promises to become the
best punter on the field. With Tomas
ini at guard, Thompson, who played
that position last year, has been shift
ed^ to tackle. The change will be bene

The freshman team is still raw. arid
not one candidate has his position as
sured. The loss of Cadwallader. â¢ the
heavy back from Pomona, who failed
to get his standing in the university
settled before the list of players was
sent to Berkeley, Is a severe one. The
team this year wiir.be a light one. both
in the line and In the back field.- There
is almost a month, however, to per
fect team play, and in that time Coach
Hauverman expects to turn out a fin
ished eleven.
There is a chance that they will be
strong enough to get Into the game,
for they are both football veterans and
do not need much coaching, but the
chance is a slim one. With these two
men put of .the game the-Cardinals
hope for victory over the Blue and Gold
receives a seriqus setback, as Dole is
the most consistent back Stanford has
had fpr many years, while Roosevelt is
a first-class lineman. ' Meanwhile a
merry fight will go on for these two
vacant positions.
Dole and Roosevelt, halfback and
guard, are both in the University Hos

least three weeks before they will be
able to leave the ward.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 23.
With the coming of the cool weather
this week came a noticeable improve
ment in the work of the Cardinal foot
ball squad. There is a snap and vigor
in the movements of the 100 candidates
for the 'varsity that was painfully
lacking a few weeks ago.
The men have settled down In the
football harness with the realization
that they will have to fight for their
positions, and it is this fighting spirit
which makes the Stanford coaches
smile hopefully. The players have lost
their early feeling of overconfldence
and have buckled down to the hardest
kind of work in splendid shape.
Throughout the week Coach Lanagan
has been teaching the heavy backs to
catch punts and the ends to run d'o'Wn
the field after them. It is fast play the
head coach seeks and he is bending
every effort to make each candidate a
"sprinter." The team's run off plays
as fast now as they did last year a
month later in the season.

OUTCOME OF GAME
A circular has been issued by I* P.
Lowe, chairman of the executive com
mittee of the Automobile Club of Cali
fornia, to the members and dealers call
ing for entries in the proposed endur
ance run^from San Francisco to Los
Angeles/ The date set for the start
from this city Is Wednesday, October 12.
Greater Interest Is being taken In the
run by the motorists of Southern Cali
fornia, who are expected to enter sev
eral cars. The route chosen is exceed
ingly well adapted for the purpose, as
besides being picturesque it offers roads
of nearly all possible kinds and enough
stiff grades to test the hill-climbing
powers of the cars. Under the condi
tions laid down any moderate powered
car can accomplish the journey, which
will be made wholly by daylight and
at reasonable speed. If the run be
brought to a successful issue it is pos
sible that California will be seleoted as
the scene of a national endurance run.
W. R. Densmore of Detroit, accompa
nied by W. W. Everett, Harold B. Lar
zalere and H. A. French, recently made
a continuous run from Los Angeles to
this city In 53 hours 40 minutes elapsed
time, following, with some deviations,
the route selected for the coming en
durance test. W. R. Densmore of the
Packard Company has attended many
of the endurance runs that have been
held in the United States, and states
that the coast road from San Francisco
to Los Angeles Is better than any he
has ever seen a3 a test of endurance.
It now behopves the managers of
garages and the owners of automobiles
to send in their entries for the endur
ance run, so that a large number of
competitors may be assured.
Eighteen cars have now been entered
for the Vanderbilt cud race, to take
place on October 2. France has entered
six cars, Germany and the United
States have five entries each and Italy
two entries. The French cars are three
ninety horsepower Panhards, a Clem
ent-Bazard of eighty horsepower, a Re
nault of ninety horsepower and a De
Dietrich of eighty horsepower. The
German cars are all Mercedes machines
of sixty horsepower. The American en
tries will include two Pope-Toledos of
sixty horsepower, the Packard Motor
Car Company's thirty horsepower Gray
Wolf, a seventy horsepower Smith &
Mabley simplex and a thirty-five horse
power Royal Tourist, to be driven by
Joseph Tracy. The Italian entries are
ninety horsepower F. I. A. T. cars, one
of them owned by Alfred Gwynne Van
derbilt.
The New York City Board of Alder
men has eased the minds of the man
agers of the run by granting permis
sion for the use of the portion of the
course lying within the limits of the
city.
On the ground at Webster street, Ala
meda, to-morrow the most exciting
cricket match of the season will be
played between the Alameda and the
San Francisco County elevens for the
championship of 1904.
This is the last match for the Brown
pennant and the winning team will be
the champions of the year. Never be
fore since the foundation of the Cali
fornia Cricket Association, in 1892, has
it happened that the last match of the
"Season had to be played to decide the
championship. Many lovers of cricket
will be on hand to witness the inter
esting contest.
The San Francisco County representa
tives will be x Harold B. Richardson
(captain), E. M. Petersen, W. R. Stew
art, P. R. John. E. J. Stratton, Henry
Roberts, A. C. Chadwick, T. J.A. Tiede
mann, H. Dixon, A. C. Davies and H.
F. Pepys.
The Alameda team will be made up
of G. Harold Ward, F. A. Stahl, W. H.
McNaughton, George Croll, S. M. Fos
ter, F. J. Croll, H. Bird, G. I. Baugh,
V. Seebeck, J. H. Saunders and W.

- On Sunday, October 2, the winners of
the 1904 championship will play against

Of the ten American master marks
men diplomas offered as trophies for
.ten best averages in marksmanship the
Â£HvÂ» -Calif ornians carried off seven out
of the 'ren, proving that every member
of the team was a past master with
the rifle. On July 6, 1876. the great day
of the Centennial team shooting, Amer
ica's best marksmen from all the States
were represented and more than 50,000
spectators were present. When the sig
nal was given for the commencement
of the day's proceedings and the tar
sets appeared Adolph Strecker fired the
first shot In the contest. Immediately
the marker waved the red flag, indi
cating that twenty-five rings one inch
In diameter had been scored. This mas
ter shot was greeted with tremendous
applause. From this time until the end
of the contest the Californians forged
steadily ahead of all other teams. Wil
liam Koenig started with three twenty
fours to his credit, and every member
of the team did excellent work at the
targets. The final result showed the
Californians had beaten the next high
est team (the Helvetias of New York)
by sixty-eight rings. Philo Jacoby won
the champion medal of the team, with
132 rings in ten shots at the half-inch
25-ring target. The victorious team
r.-as crowned with laurel wreaths and
presented with the Centennial champion
goblet as evidence of their superior
marksmanship. This trophy is seml
annually filled with champagne and
passed around among the marksmen at
the distribution of prizes "won at the
various festivals.
On .the return of the successful team
to San Francisco the marksmen kept
up their practice at the rifle range in
Alameda. The California Schuetzen
Club gained rapidly in membership and
wealth, and after weathering many
Ftorms, which threatened its existence,
it is to-day the largest citizen rifle as-
Fociation in America, embracing more
than 240 members and owning the
handsome grounds known as the Cali
fornia Schuetzen Park, near San Ra
farl. The club has an ample treasury
and 1000 shares of dividend-paying park
stock, amounting to about $15,000. In
addition to a prize shooting for mem
tors every Sunday in the year, the club
u!so gives a semi-annual festival, open
to all marksmen, at which many valu
able prtzes in money and merchandise
are won by successful contestants.
The California Schuetzen Club has a
history of which its members and all
citizens of California may be proud.
It was organized on the 6th day of Jan
uary. 1876. for the purpose of repre
senting California at the great centen
r.ial world's shooting contest, which
vas to take place in Philadelphia, and
at which the best marksmen from
America, Europe and England were to
compete.
A request to enter a California team
had been sent by the centennial com
mission to Philo Jacoby. who. during the
years 18CS, 1S70 and 1873 had success
fully represented California marks
manship in the East and in Europe by
carrying off many of the best prizes
offered at the different festivals. He
issued a call to his comrades of the
rifle, and on January 6. 1876, Adolph
Strecker. Abraham Rahwyler, William
Ehrenpfort. J. A. Bauer, William
Koenig, William Heber. A- Ingold. Cap
tain C. K. Zlmmer and others met and
organized the California Schuetzen
flub. Philo Jacoby was elected pres
ident and A. Rahwyler vice president.
A few days later the club held its first
prize shoot in Alameda and with the
aid of Herman Bremer constructed the
first 200-yard range in California. A
bear flag was ordered as an insignia of
the club and a beautifully carved griz
zly adopted as a mascot.
June, 1876. the California Schuet
zon Vlub team, composed of William
Ehreripfort. J. A- Bauer, William
Streuli. William Koenig. A. Rahwyler,
A. Strecker and Philo Jacoby, went at
iheir own expense to Philadelphia to
represent California at the world's
contest. They competed during the
right days' festival of the American
Sharpshooters' Association, at which
more than 1000 marksmen competed.
The Californians carried off most of
the first prizes.
The riflemen of San Francisco and
vicinity are eagerly iooking forward to
the annual fall shooting festival of the
California Schuetzen Club to be held
in Schuetzen Park near San Rafael on
October 2 and 3. The large number
of prizes and trophies offered on the
different targets have proved an in
ducement to marksmen all over the
State. Communications have been re
ceived from Sacramento, San Jose, Pet
aluma and other points, asking for full
information and expressing a desire to
take part in the proceedings.
There will be twenty targets at the
disposal of participants and the com
mittee in charge of the affair will
have everything in readiness for
marksmen to establish new scores.
There will be more than 5700 in cash
and about $1500 in mercnandise prizes
distributed among the lucky winners. ;
The main event of the festival will I
be the competition for snooting king.
Many well known riflemen of the State
have already signified their intention
of entering this event and it is certain
the contest will be hotly fought out.
There will be 200 shots fired on this i
target and if A. Strecker, the present
king, wishes to hold the honors for
another vear he will have to be at his
best. As the festival is open to all
comers, regardless of any club to which
they may belong, a large crowd of rifle
men and gpectators will be in attend
ance.
. The allowance of each boat will be
deducted from her actual sailing time.
Cups will be awarded to the owners of
the yachts taking first, second and third
places.
To-day and to-morrow are open on
the programme of the Corinthian Yacht
Club. The California Yacht Club has a
race for the twenty-foot class on its
programme for to-morrow. On Sunday,
October 2, the handicap regatta for the
Vincent cup will be held.
"Members* night" last Saturday at
the quarters of the San Francisco
Yacht Club was much enjoyed by those
who took part in the games. In the
whist tournament F. A- Hyde and R. F.
Bell won three games: A. G. A. Mueller
and W. M. Field, two games; G. F.
Holzheiser and W. Harrison, two
games; A. E. "Wray and A. Epsten, W*.
B. Gilbert and L. C. Pistolesi, one
game. The prizes were awarded to
Holzheiser and Harrison, who won only
two games, but beat Hyde and Bell.
F. G. Phillips won the billiard tourna
ment, C. P. Coles was victorious at
chess and F. J. Hood at checkers. At
dominoes J. M. Punnett won first prize
and F. G. Phillips second.

In brief, the advantages of Hoffman's
engine are that it will occupy not more
than one-fourth , the ordinary floor
space required for other engines of sim
ilar power; it will effect- a saving of
one-fourth in steam; it Is economical
in construction and operation and it is
without vibration.
A year ago P. T. Berg of Stockholm,
Sweden, formerly of the Carnegie Steel
Company and now consulting engineer
for the United States ; Steel Corpora
tion, examined Hoffman's engine for
Charles M. Schwab and made a favor
able report on the inventor's . claims.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, several of whose
inventions are now in use on the New

that the engine will send all of the

STOCKTON, Sept. 23.â A dispatch
from Jamestown states that a plot to
destroy the property . of the Rawhide
mine was discovered a few days ago,
and San Francisco detectives are now
there attempting to secure' evidence
which will bring the conspirators to
justice.
The mine was shut down for. repairs
this week. While tearing up the floor
in -the power-room the head carpenter
found beneath the floor and directly
under the big 100 horsepower electric
motor an infernal machine connected
by copper wire with a distant portion
of the mine property. The machine con
sisted of two large pieces of heavy iron
pipe filled ' with about fifty pounds of
dynamite. Appearances indicate that
the machine had lain there some time.
If the machine had been exploded it
Wvould have wrecked the entire power
plant of the mine â the steam plant, the
sawmill and last, and most important,
the hoisting plant over the big shaft.
With the hoisting plant destroyed the
miners beneath the surface would prob
ably have perished miserably.
Last February the union miners in
the. Rawhide went out on strike. After
the strike had proceeded some time
Captain Nevills declared for open-shop
and brought in non-union miners to
take the places of the strikers. Since
then there has been much bitterness
in labor circles in the mountain town.
Special Dispatch to The Call.

then with his veteran rival, Xewton

The Empire and other cluba have
spared no expense on their preserves
this year and counted on grand sport
on opening day. How much the storm
will affect the early shooting remains
to be seen.
The patter of the raindrops dur'nj
the past forty-eight hours has sounded
like a dirge in the ears of the sports
men who maintain extensive preserves
for duck shooting. For months past
they have been baiting their frish
water ponds with grain and the mil
lions of ducks have been waxing
fat on it. With the coming of the
rain it is expected the birds will scat
ter to all points of the compass and
will turn up their aristocratic bills at
the artificial feed of the ponds an<t
will, seek the wild celery and other
delicacies upon which they prefer to
feed.

the business. Hastings finished the
game for Portland. Although he used
a slow ball he heljj Seattle down to
one run and six hits. Umpire Mc-
Carthy and Parke Wilson came close
to mixing it before the game. It was
the result of a little trouble yesterday,

saving the game, Gorton was sent in
to bat for Gochnauer in the ninth inn
ing to-day, but with two men on bases
he sent up a difficult chance back of
second base which Casey caught, spoil
ing the Seals' chances. The visitors
made a game bid for victory by scor
ing tv.-ice in the eighth after Hilde
brand hit for a home run with none
on bases in the seventh.
Two runs came when Irwin and An
derson hit safely. They advanced on
a wild pitch and scored on Leahy's
hit. The first run came on Barber's
safety, Casey's error, a sacrifice and
an out. Three men were left on bases
in the fourth.
Doyle scored first for the Tigers on
a pass, Eagan's hit and Lynch's two
bagger. The second run came on two
singles, a sacrifice and Leahy's error
at the plate. Two more arrived on
Sheehan's single. Van Buren's error, a
double steal and Lynch's hit. The last
came on a pass, a sacrifice and Shee
han's two-bagger. Barber was wild
but effective at critical times. Eagan
did some star fielding. Score:

SUMMARY.
Joe was in fairly good shape when he
started to train for the bout, but never
theless, be is working like a trojan, as
he knows he has a hard fight before
him. He was up with the larks yes
terday and took a spin to Corte Madera
and back, a distance of twelve miles,
tocompanied by Kid Sullivan. In the
i fternon Joe punched the bag six
rotxadB, skipped the rope and did some
s-hadow boxing. He weighs 138 pounds.
Trainer McDonald does not wish Joe to
don the mitts, as he is afraid he will
injure his hands.
Hereford wanted Jack Welch to ref
eree, and as there was no reason why
Le should not, he was agreed upon by
all the parties interested-
Hereford is still waiting patiently to
hear from Britt regarding a match
v ith Gans for the championship.
Although the weather was unfavor
able many sporting pen Journeyed to
San Rafael yesterday to see Gans
v.ork out. Gans is slowly rounding
Into form at Billy Shannon's Villa, un
der the watchful eyes of Trainer Billy
McDonald.
ThP Gans-Walcott fight hung in the
balance ail day yesterday and far Into
the r.isht. Manager Hereford repudiat
ed th<* terms made by 'Gans, who was
en th" ground, and by Zick Abrams,
who represented Hereford, and for a
time there v.as a deadlock.
The men agreed to fight at 142
pounds, ringside, while Hereford held
out for 140. Failing to get this con
c'ssi' 1^ he wanted the San Francisco
.Athletic Club to guarantee that there
v ould be 510,000 taken at the door.
While it is conceded that the gate
money will reach a larger sum than
this the club refused to accede to his
demand. The fighters are to receive 50
j'or cent of the gate receipts, of which
60 per cent will ro to the winner. Here
ford will receive an additional 5 per
cent from the club's share as a bonus.
After hours of acrimonious wrangling
Manaser Pierce agreed to have "Wal
cott weigh in at 141 pounds and the
match was cinched.
The other bouts were hard fought
contests, but there was not a knockout
during the evening.
In the first event Mike Kutehos. a 110
pounder, won a hard earned decision
over Ed Levatt. The judges awarded
Ed Mensor the palm in his go with
George Raymond. Dode Needham was
given the decision over Kid Vedo in a
contest where either man could have
been declared winner with satisfaction.
George Sullivan, the heavyweight
boxer, gained the decision over Louis
Balletro after four round/ of hurricane
fighting last night at the Lincoln Club's
exhibition. Sullivan's lead was slight.
He did the leading while Balletro was
willing to lie back and counter. At
the end of the fourth round the house
was in an uproar and both men were
fighting furiously. They presented a
gory appearance when the gong sound
ed. Sullivan used his lert to good ad
vantage. He would rusTi and send it
to the head and body, slowing Balletro
perceptibly at times. Balletro used a
right uppercut, but could not find the
vulnerable spot. The decision was well
received.
Bob Cairns of the Olympic Club waÂ«
given the verdict over Joe Podesta in*"*
the 140 pound class. Cairns appeared
to have an advantage in weight and
during the first two rounds he punished
Podesta severely. The latter was game
and kept on fighting. When the last
round was reached Cairns appeared to
be willing to stopr
Eddie Carr, a little 120 pounder from
the Brooklyn Club, put up an excel
lent go with Abe Label. Though ha
lost the decision he made Abe pay a
v.holelot of respect to his right hand,
/rhe gd was exciting and both boys
fought each other to a standstill at
several stages of the contest. Label's
crouch seemed to have Carr worried,
as he could not draw him out.

event at Harlem- to-day, was backed
from 9 to 5 to 6 to 5,^ galloped ia front
all the way,' winning easily' by' two

Nicol wentright'to â¢ the front at the
first turn, and, opening up a gap of
two and a half lengths, held the ad
vantage throughout. The programme
was only an ordinary one and the rac

The track, although .fast, was not at
its best and fast time was. not made

GRAVESEND, Sept. 23.â The closest
finish of the current meeting at Graves
end was seen to-day in the nine-fur
long handicap, the third race on the
card. - Top * weight was- carried by Co
lonial Girl, winner of the World's Fair
handicap at St. Louis and of. the Om
nium handicap at Sheepshead Bay.
This mare, ..which was handicapped at
ninety-seven pounds when she. defeat
ed Hermis at St. Louis and at 107
pounds In ' the Omnium, is tc\day re
quired by handicappers to take up 122
pounds. ' â¢,
She was poorly ridden by pooker, the
pace' being set by Hurst Park. Ostrich
pressed him closely, but as Hurst Park
gwung wide he carried Ostrich out and
thus enabled Adriutha, John Sanford's
clever daughter of Clifford, to come on
next the rail, thereby, gaining some
ground. The finish was a most exciting
one. Hurst "Park waa in the center of
the course, with Ostrich on his right
and Adriutha on the outside. The lat
ter received the verdict, while not more
than a length and j a half away was
Colonial Girl, which lost no friends by
her defeat. .

a Japanese daily at 535 Geary street.
Life to him had become a reign of
terror because of the way he was being
constantly haunted by highbinders. In
a letter found on his person he said
this and also that it was his dc-ire
to read his own obituary notice.
Schitaro was 28 years old and Jour
neyed to this country several years
ago to seek a fortune for himself and
a fair wife in old Yokohama. He
worked at his trade _and was appar
ently happy until the highbinders be
gan to pursue him. Their relentless
chase after him soon had its effect, and
rather than be captured or killed by
his mortal enemies he decided Jto quit
hl'j earthly existence.

Business was light on all the exchanges,
though there was a fair amount of trading
in tl*e Tonopah mines. The only fluctuation
worthy of note on the Bond Exchange was a
further advance In Pacific States Tel. & Tel.

General Leonard Wood Is in com
mand of the district. The War De
partment has no information what
ever of a recent butchery, nor has any
information of it come to the United
States in press dispatches. General
Ainsworth, military secretary to the
general staff, and other War Depart
ment officials, through whose hands
reports from the Philippines pass,
deny having any report of the affair.
General Wood'reported on February
29 that Sultan Hassan.'s band of Moros
had been destroyed by a detachment
under Major Hugh L. Scott. His re
port did not give the number of Moros
killed, wounded or captured, but said:
"All hostiles are now dead or cap
tured but Hassan, who is located."
Army officers who have seen service
In the Philippines estimated that the
Sultan had about 600 men. Sultan
Hassan is now confined in the guard
house at Mindanao. Rapid-fire guns
are trained upon the guardhouse and
upon the only point from which a res
cuing party could approach.' In the
event of such a raid the rapid-fire
guns would surely cause the death of
the Sultan and his followers.
In a private letter mailed on the
island on August 3, postmarked Ma
nila, August 17, and received here on
September 19, there appears the fol
lowing:
Yesterday we had another battle with Moros.
We killed about 230 men, women and children.
Thoee who were present say it was a most
terrible si?ht. Our troops cornered the Moros
and killed every one In sight and thea burned
everything they had.
If the officials will only let our men do this
about twice more there will be no more
trouble. The Moroa have been sneaking in
and cutting ud our sentinels.
We are retting hardened to the killing of
Moros the more we see our own men cut up.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 23. â Sensa
tional details of the alleged butchery
of 250 Moros â men, women and chil
dren â by United States troops in the
Lake Lanas country, island of Min
danao, on August 1. are given in pri
vate letters that have been received
here. The writers describe it as the
most horrible affair since the "kill and
burn" campaign of General "Hell
Roaring Jake" Smith in the island of
Samar.
Admiral Dewey is the only naval of
ficer on the active list who has served
fifty years. Rear Admiral Watson
comes next in length of service, hav
ing entered in 1856. Only seven offi
cers now living were classmates of Ad
miral Dewey. They are: Rear Admir
als Farquhar, Howison, Howell and
Kautz, Captain A. V. Reed, Comman
der Bishop, all retired, and Major Col
lum of the Marine Corps.
CALL. BUREAU, HOTEL. BARTON.
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 23.â Admiral
Dewey completed to-day fifty years oC
service In the United States Navy. He
Is sixty-seven years old and takes more
interest in the navy and affairs in gen
eral than many officers in their forties.
No man less desires to see another -war.
but if it should come at an early date
it is small secret that the victor of
Manila Bay would dearly love to com
mand the American forces at sea.
The Admiral received the congratula
tions of President Roosevelt by letter
from the White House as he sat at
his desk in the offices of the General
Board, of which he is president. This
board looks after strategical and tac
tical questions in the navy, and Ad
miral Dewey Is at his office nearly
every morning of the bu3y season.

NEW YORK. Bent. 23.â There U evidently
a pr;>grÂ«6Â«ive diminution In tbe Interest In the

IaÂ«t week's daily dealings Jn over a million
*lw.rtF.' This Jrave* but '.ne day cf this week
In whirh transaction* reached that aggregate.
tjfrtJment *eernÂ«l aJtcifpther indifferent to the

tn<Â«t part t.> meaper tradings. There was not
Â«vÂ«t. tli* congested activity In fpecttl stocks,
â¢Â¦ ;.;Â¦ h is all that has kÂ«pt up tbe level of tbe

Â«vcr. t-ontlnued the most prominent features In
the market. Tbe circulation of rumors re
pardlnsr them, which has been Inoes6ant
throughout the week, was not In evidence to
*4ay. I*crl.af.s for that reason tbe strength of
Vaiaa Pacific fÂ«*med to impart some strength
in ron-f. cr-hcrs in its group by- Fymi-athv
AtchiÂ»< n Â»Â»Â« rtot notably uliecloAr-, The East

overcame the early tligbt depression which
affected th<tn, which watt partly due to Belling
attributed to London account. The falling oft
!n net eamir.rs for August r*norted by the
Baltimore and Ohio may have act^d as a drag,
on the croup. A rather lanaruid Interest was
tal.cn In the bank statement, although the
halt in the market oseratlons may have been
with Â¦ deÂ«ir* to know the complexion of to
morrw'j! statement before extending opcra

Thursday night. Tftere is mine probability of
a contraction In the loan item, as ft is said
that the tmst companies have been placing

Trade In the Potato market was more
active yesterday than at any time during the
pttst two weeks, as retailer* were of the opin

chasing more freely than previously.- The
market was still heavily supplied, however,
and prices showed no improvement. The
same may be said of Onions. â¢
Changes in miscellaneous' vegetables wrre
Flight. Fresh arrivals of Tomatoes and Lima
Beans did better during the early trade, as
most of the day's receipts came to band late.
Prices sagged, however, upon tbe arrival of
the belated supplies, and there Â¦ was quite a
surplus unsold at the close.

"It was a fairly steady, and hesitating mar
ket during the early part of the day. but ad
vanced rapidly at the close. The large-re
ceipts caused some uncertainty In the feeling
as to whether tlie milling demand would ab
sorb them. As heretofore, the milling demand
took all offerings. of Wheat In all markets and
generally at higher prices. They report a good
demand for Flour. While the Southwest move
ment may and probably will decrease Foma
what, the Northwest movement Is likely to
continue for some weeks. Will the mills con
tinue to absorb this, or'^wlll they not? So far
they are doing so."

CHICAGO, Sept. 23. â The excitement In the
wheat market came toward the close of the
day. Notwithstanding heavy receipts In the
Northwest the market opened firm, December
being up Â»4c to %c at $1*10% to $1 10%. In
itial quotations of May were %c lower. to
higher at $1 12% to -$1 12%. The Improved
tone at the start was due to higher cables,
wet weather In Manitoba and Minnesota and
decreased shipments from Argentina, Several
prominent operators were active buyers of thÂ«
December option, the demand blng so pro
nounced as to induce general covering by
shorts. From $1 10%, at which price Decem
ber iÂ«old soon after the opening, an advance to
$1 11% was made. May in the meantime sell
ing up to $1 12%. The market then broke,
under fair realizing ealcs, tba Impression be
ing that some big holders were quietly dis
posing of their linen while ostensibly support
ing the bull movement. After remaining
around $1 11 the market again receded. The
bears were given encouragement about this
time by a report oi a St. Louisj â¢ trade journal
statins that weather conditions in the South
weet continued favorable for the new . sown
crop. Increased ' primary receipts were an
other factor. Tlie market, however A wu
drifting down when trading suddenly became
wild. News from abroad wap considered ex
tremely bullish. Shorts, alarmed at the pros
pects, were Instantly animated* buyers. "With
light offerings, prices rose rapidly. One of
the main features In the foreign cables was
a rumor that the French Government was con
templating the removal of the import duty on
wheat. Another factor was the announcement
made by a well-known foreign crop statisti
cian to the effect that the requirements of.im
porting countries this year would be the heav
iest on record. These advices, combined with
reports from St. Louis of a good demand for
flour, were tho principal influences that con
tributed to the late bullishness. Just before
the close the December options sold at $1 14,
closing lc up at $1 13%@1 13%. May anvanced
to $1 14%. closing with a gain of lc at $1 14%
Â«fl 14%. u
Warm weather throughout the West was the
dominating Influence In the corn market. De
cember closed at SO>40<{>O3fcc. Tbe oat mar
ket was weak as a result of rapidly increasing
stocks. December closed %<jjf%e up to 30%e~-
Early weakness in corn Induced some liqui
dation of provisions, but there was enough
demand to hold prices steady. The fact that
the hog movement Is small and shows no
signs Â¦ of Increasing prevented any great
amount of selling. At the close January pork
was a shade higher, lard was up 2%c and ribs
closed unchanged.

Th* ; local trade are talking rery bearishly
on Beans now. They have received advices
from Michigan to th* effect that the crop of
that State will amount to the enormous quan
tity of 7.000.000 bu&hels. the average crop
being from 3,<>Â«O.OCO to 4.000,000 bnshels. ThÂ«
weather has been ideal for Beans; the crop
has not been touched by rain and the quality
Is fine. The market there Is very weak and
Michigan white Beans are selling In New Or
leans and Texas at prices equivalent to $2 13
for our Beans f. o. b. here. Hence California
white Beans must come down to this figure at
least to get Into the Southern markets. It ia
this condition that make* this market weak.

fcuÂ»>piÂ»-nici:tary to the above a Ban Fran

licllll letter from the W. A. Gordon Com
racy of Portland. Ore.:
A PORTLAND POINTER.
"ReierriEi to your fa.vor of tlie 17th. You
*.rÂ« no doubt right about shipments of flour
from the NurLh dÂ«TresBlr.g your wheat mar
ket. It ii;:KJ!Â» that Oriental markets are
BBWfiUsC to rÂ»>" the higher price tor flour
*u4 are holding Lack, bluffing a little. But
that won't lart always. They cafl't get cheap
er flour ar.yÂ«faere else, and they wiil have to
pay the price and renew their supply. The
J< i!Â«;er they uail the keener will be the de
mand. Id the meantime our millers are our
Â¦ harpext competitors in the wheat market,
some cf them raying more than can be real
Â»:rd in your market. Eut you, and the San
Kranoisco trade in general, arc laboring under
m. delusion ia assuming that the purchase? lor
HaetÂ»ni acccuut are likely to be dumped on
>our market at any time. They are shipping
tt out farter than you have any idea of and
tfcry are Retting plenty of car?. Train after
train if MBpCia are" coming from the East.
Y<Â»u ar* also mUtcien if you think there are
trtily 6.000,000 bushe-s sold that way. Nearly
cue-half ol the croa is already sold for East
ern account. Sold to feed the mills and not
tender eti the board. One of our correÂ«i>oiid
Â«r.tf in the thickest part of the wheat coun
try east of the mountains writes thai four
fifliir of the crop in tois territory is sold to
go East. In a former l'-tter we intima.t<Â»d
that only th<? territory conttgu-jus to Portlan>i.
that itÂ« this t-idf of L'matilU. would b* avail
able for the California market, snd that by
rcan-n of lower freight to Pon.la.rd. But that
is nÂ« lor.jrr truf. Tl.rre are Eastern buyers
Jn thU city now picking up any let they can
find a* far wen ai> The Dalles. None of the
l>.M-:r. purchases as lar as we know are
bought to bold on *i>ecuUiiuii. but to supply
mills.
â¢"At f.rxt they w-re a littl* timid about our
rlub wheat, not knowing what kind of flour
It would make, but j<iri'-<Â» experimenting with
ihe first shipment? they seem to be eager for
It. cj-pecially for "ur Shornjan County club.
ATi'ibor delus-i^n that is afflietinR vour San

of lA-ing overwhelmc-d and crushed with our
wh^at. One of the most lHK;ral shippers to
yiiur market early this reason was heard to
rÂ»y that he had b^cn slaughtered there and
Is " not likely to deluge your market here
after. Aside from thÂ» Kanern demand, Llvor
fwvii ha>- rj w advanced to about a parity
with ><-.ur q-i-tations. And won't Liverpool
f. hlpher when they realize that thero Ik
rtnthlng it expert from thic continent to spoalr

for wheat on the nart of millers on the At
lrr.t'r CoaÂ»t, there It a movement herÂ« to
inaururate shipmen*E by steamers from hiere
to >."â¢* Tork around the Cape. It is all a

NEW RULES ARE ADOPTED
FOR CHINATOWN GUIDES
A masked robber, small of stature
but a giant of nerve and action, suc
cessfully executed a holdup at the
break of day yesterday that has never
been rivaled in the history of crime in
this city. This daring manipulator
qtrjetly robbed Cashier Frank T. Flynn

quick. I want It." It came so suddenly that
1 complied with the order, and as I did I
turned around â¢ and got ' a ' glimpse of the lone
After waiting several minutes Flynn
finally shoved the door open by force.
The police were quickly communicated
with and detectives were put to work.
Some one had a suspicion that Mitchell
was concerned in the hold-up, and
working on information furnished by
officials of the exchange Detectives
O'Day and Mulcahy arrested him in a
barber shop at Post and Octavia streets
shortly before noon..
In an. interview Flynn said:
The clerk and the cashier never en
ter the office of the exchange through
the front door, but pass in by means
of a side entrance, thence through a
small passageway and behind the
counter. As. they walked along the
alleyway yesterday morning, a voice
from behind was suddenly heard to ex
claim: "Drop that suit case and be
Quick; I want it.".
Flynn, under the impulse of the mo
ment, dropped his valuable package,
and both the men turned around to see
what the trouble was. As they did so
a masked man leaped from a dark cor
ner and said, "Don't look at me or I'll
blow your head -off. .Walk" into that
closet, both of you," pointing to a
washroom a few feet away.
Both men. obeyed the command, and
in the meantime A. B. Phipps, an aged
employe of the â¢ exchange, who
opens up the place each morn
ing, made his appearance in the
passageway. He was also bustled into
the toilet-room. When the robber had
thus placed the three men securely he
fastened the door with a piece of rope
and attached the other end to a large
staple In the wall. Warning the trio
not to make a move under penalty of
death, he noiselessly left the place and
disappeared through the side door.
FLYNN TELLS HIS STORY".
Both Flynn and Hearney are trusted
employes of the firm, though both arÂ«>.
young in years. For the last six years
Flynn has made the journey from
Market and Montgomery streets with
his precious burden unmolested.
Hearney has accompanied him on his
mission for three years. During that
time neither had ever been molested,
and the thought of being held up never
entered the mind of either of these
faithful employes.
The robbery took place at 6:50. It
is the custom of Flynn and Hearney
to go to the Union Trust Company.
Market and Montgomery streets, each
evening and deposit the day's receipts
in the safety vaults and then to return
early the next morning and bring back
a portion of the money for the day's
operations. Yesterday they, left the
bank vaults together, carrying $4400
snugly stowed away in an ordinary
dress suit case.
CASHIER IS HELD UP.
change, 20 Leidesdorff street, of $4400
in gold and currency just as the lat
ter entered the office, accompanied by
Clerk Hugh T. Hearney. Five, hours
later, J. P. Mitchell, a hanger-on of the
place, was arrested and is now being
held by the police on suspicion of hav
ing committed the crime. The de
tectives say they have evidence against
Mitchell that will make a strong case.
The crime had evidently been planned
and studied out for a long time, and
the man who nursed the daring deed in
his brain was doubtless familiar with
each inch of the ground and knew his
business so well that the making of a
false move was nearly impossible. The
deed was done so quickly that the vic
tims of the plot hardly had a chance
to realize what had happened till all
was over.
Mitchell has been a hanger-on of the
exchange for many, months and has
been regarded as a nuisance by the em
ployes. One of them said last night
that Mitchell tried to pass a bogus
check on Broker William McCracken
some time â¢ since, and also tried the
same game at the exchange. He is
alleged to have raised a stock certifi
cate, but the paper was too crude to
pass the scrutiny; of- the cashier. He
had been ordered out of the office many
times, but always showed up again.
A search of Mitchell's clothing re
vealed $600 in gold and bank notes. One
of these notes, $100 in amount, was
positively identified by Flynn as be
longing to the exchange! It was issued
by the National Bank fo.Joplin, Mo.,
and only the previous day Flynn had
remarked how strange it was that they
should-come into possession of a large
note of su<5h an unimportant bank.
When "sweated" by ! Detective Ed
Wren and Captain' of Detectives Mar
tin, Mitchell maintained his bravado
and laughed at the idea of his being
connected with the hold-up. When
asked how it was that he had come into
possession of such a large amount of
money he replied, "Oh, that's nothing.
I sometimes carry as much as $6000
with me." ?'â¢'.; â¢
Mitchell was arrested while being
shaved in the barber shop. The two de
tectives then' searched his room at 1537
Octavia street, and there they found a
piece of rope, which tallies with the one
tied on the door, 1 a wet hat and coat,
identified by the three men who were
locked in the closet, and a 38-caliber
Smith & Wesson revolver, . together
with two rounds of ammunition..
Hearney and Phipps made practically
the same statements as Flynn. Â¦ The de
scription by the three men tallies in
every respect. Phipps said that he saw
Mitchell in the passageway three min
utes before the hold-up j occurred, and
positively identifies him as the man who
turned the bold trick. Hearney and
Flynn are also positive in their iden
tity of Mitchell, and they all knew him
well.

highwayman. But It was only a glimpse, for
in a cool voice he said. "Don't look at me or
I'Jl blow your heads off. Get Into -that closet,
quick, both of you."
We. complied with the order and as we were
about to enter the closet Phipps came 'into the
hallway by another door. He was also or
dered Into thÂ» room. The fellow quickly fas
tened the door with a piece of rope, which
he tied to a staple on the wall. Then warn
ing us not to make a move he quietly slipped
through the Fide door and out into the Â»treet.
I kicked the door open In a few minutes
and notififd the police. I -know the deed wae
committed by some one familiar with the
place, and he had everything planned. He
even nailed that staple near the door so it
could be easily fastened. Another staple was
nailed near the office, door, so that he could
cut off approach from the outer room.
ThÂ« robber was a man of about 5 feet . 6
Inches in height, and seemingly weighed about
150 pounds. He wore a white handkerchief
over his face with slits for eyeholes. His
dark slouch hat was pulled down j over his
eyes, und neither Hearney nor myself could
get a glimpse of his features. He had a big
gun in his right hand and went about his
work with the ease and grace of one who knew

KEANE CHOICE
OF REPUBLICANS
The' Supervisors, had another storm.
They had , summoned F. M. Yorke be
fore them to explain . his . claim for
$(.264-20 for pavement repair work dur
ing August, the bill not being itemized.
Brandenstein began to go after the
witness somewhat energetically as to
who were the officers and stockholders
of the corporation known as F. ' M.
Yorke & Co.. Yorke, shied, was
utterly unable to recall who were in
terested in the company with him, and
finally became very angry. He declared
that he had never been abused be
fore in his life as by Brandenstein,
"whose snarl alone would drive a man
crazy." "Wish I had you aboard ship,
added the irate contractor. Yorke said
If he was to be put on the rack he
would give up all his "petty" contracts
with the city. He was finally placated
and next Thursday afternoon the rec
ords are. to be produced for the inspec
tion of the committeemen so they can
learn what that $6200 was expended for.
Brandenstein afterward explained
that he had received an anonymous
communication arousing suspicion as
to who constituted Yorke & Co., al
though no names were mentioned in it.
BRANDENSTEIN IN Â¦ DANGER.
Finally things cooled down and the
investigation proceeded, Chairman
Brandenstein cautioning Braunhart to
confine himself to the gathering of evi
dence and not to indulge in argument.
The irrepressible commissioner would
be aroused occasionally, but Branden
stein soothed him and petted him and
managed to control him with a fair
degree of. success.
The matter under discussion was the
bill of Gray Brothers, who exact twelve
dollars a day rental for each. of their
street sweeping machines. "Hire of
a team is no more than $5," explained
Braunhart, "and this left $7 a day the
charge for rental of a machine that
new only costs $350. In other words the
city is- paying 51350 a year for the hire
of a machine. that costs about a fourth
of that amount." '. . ;
In criticizing the Public Works Board
for this contract Braunhart arrayed
the other complaints he. had to" make
against the department, and this was
what caused Schmitz to run amuck.
Harry N. Gray explained that it
costs $4 a day to "maintain the rattan
brooms, which ; wear 'very rapidly on
the basalt pavements. Team hire, he
said, was $6 a day. and incidental ex
pense, $1 50. VFrom his figures it-ap
peared that the profit to his firm was
very small. .

gation on Thursday at 2:30 o'clock.
sent. "You are a gentleman," he sneer
ed at the Mayor's brother.
Once Braunhart did undertake to re-
"Your slanderous tongue is' being
wagged on every occasion," was the
picturesque beginning after a new take
in of breath, "and you have got to stop
it now. You are lying and lying about
us, just to do cheap politics for Mc-
Nab A man like, that on this com
mittee! Why, he ought to be wearing
a pair of horns. I will buy him a pair
and sent them to him as a gift next
Christmas."
The 'excited president of the Public
Works Board continued on a tirade of
this character for several minutes,
shaking his arm in a threatening man
ner over the head of the unperturbed
Supervisor. Brandenstein was in the
chair, but impotent. Pleadingly he
sought the commissioner to desist his
ravings. merely said 'Â»shut up.
you fellows," D'Ancona turned around
on his heel several times and Payot
was mute. There was not a hand
raised to protect Braunhart. who ap
peared very much in danger of a per
sonal assault.
In the language of the street Schmitz
had the Supervisors "buffaloed," with
the exception of Braunhart, who blurt
ed out at one of the lulls. "I am only
telling what is the fact."
This- provoked again the high-keyed
outburst from Schmitz. "You are a
liar." The commissioner kept going
again for several minutes and the Su
pervisors were once more treated to a
flaying of their fellow member, while
he stood stolidly through the ordeal.
RESENTS WITH A ; SNEER.
The hand of Supervisor Brandenstein
held . gravel, but his arm was limp
and he could no more stay the torrent
of attose that President Herbert
Schmitz of the Public Works Board
heaped on the members of the Street
and Finance committees, who were in
joint session yesterday, than a terrl
lled weakling cair cope with a wild
man.
Supervisor Braunhart was particular
ly the object of the enraged commis
sioner's fiery outbursts.
"You are a liar, you are simply try
ing to do dirty McNab politics," was
the declaration with which Schmitz
broke loose.
Braunhart had charged that the
Board of Public Works was ignoring
the charter flagrantly, both as regards
the civil j service requirements as to
street employes and the provision that
the board must make requisition on,the
Supervisors 'for, every expenditure of
funds.
The Supervisor remained silent un
der the attack and this only irritated
the commissioner the more. Schmitz
advanced from his chair to the side
of the standing Supervisor and there
delivered himself of his wrath. >"
