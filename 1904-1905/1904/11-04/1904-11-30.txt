NEW YORK, Nov. 29.- â Andrew Carnegie has been
brought into the great Chadwick mystery in a most
sensational manner. Not only does Mrs. Ghadwick claim
to hold a note for $500,000, signed by Carnegie, but she
declares further that she is his daughter. Carnegie denies
that he ever made a note for $500,000 to the woman.
Mrs. Chadwick used this note to prove the claim that she
was his daughter, and she also utilized her" alleged rela

out in Chicago to-day. Acting on evi

Federal detectives, assisted by the Chi
cago police, to-day made raids on
places "where bogus drugs are said to
be made, confiscated four patrol wagon
loads of "medicine," and arrested five
persons for misusing the. malls. This
was the result of the Government's at
tack, which is said to be national in
scope, and likely to result In scores of
arrests in different cities.
The evidence upon which the arrests
of to-day were made was based upon
a chemical analysis made by Dr. Virgil
Coblentz, professor at Columbia Uni

authorities. He found that '-triethy
late," sold to druggists as a substitute
for "trional." a sleep-producing medi

satin. It followed modish lines in de

description of the missing brother
and the brutal assailant are so similar
that after Gavin had finished his tale
Captain Moore immediately inquired
â¢whether William had not taken his

ing "No."
A peculiar thing about the robbery
that attracted the attention of the de

turned the puree of his victim after
removing the contents and she found
it empty after regaining consciousness.
So convinced are the police of the
guilt of William Gavin that when he
is found he will be arrested on charge
of assault on and robbery of his sister.

An example of the grit of the game
cock has been reported by Frank E.
Carroll, a farmer and bird fancier,
who lives between this city and Long
port. About three weeks ago he re
ceived a fine gray gamecock from
Sacramento, Cal. Early this morning
Carroll was awakened by yie loud
cackling of every fowl he owned. : He
hurried to the barnyard. * There lay
a large fox, dead, while the game
cock was vainly trying to free his
spurs from the head of the fox.
Carroll found *that one of the bird's
spurs had penetrated the right eye of
the fox and entered the brain. The
thin wires in front of the coop where
the bird was kept were torn apart,
showing that the fox had endeavored
to make a meal of the gamecock,
which escaped and, flying at the fox,
managed to sink a spur Into its eye.

"Mr. Carnegie read this report and
pronounced it absurd. Mr. Carnegie
does not know the woman at all." ,
Subsequently Ryall said the receiver
ship proceedings in the Chadwick case
in Cleveland were postponed to enable
Mrs. Chadwick to make a settlement
of Newton's claim. Â¦ ;
"It was the understanding last
night," said Ryall, "that Mrs. Chad
wick would settle a' large part of-^few
ton's claim in cash and give security
for the. balance."
S Ryall did not know that Mrs. Chad
wick had secured the funds necessary.
Ryall was asked to-day if it might
be possible that Â¦ the name "Andrew
Carnegie", had been forged, and re
plied:
"If that is so, less than forty-eight
hours will elapse before some one is
.under arrest."
The following statement ,was made
by Carnegie's secretary:
A meeting of Mrs. Chadwick's cred
itors was held here to-day and was
presided over by George E. Ryall, the
New York attorney for Herbert New
ton of Brookline, Mass., who is suing
Mrs. Chadwick for the recovery of
$190,800 lent her on notes. Ryall to
day issued' the following statement:
"There was a conference at my office
at which there were present Mr. New
ton, Mr. Carver of Boston, Judge John
Albaugh of Canton, of counsel for
Mrs. Chadwick, and myself. On behalf
of Mrs. Chadwick, Judge Albaugh re
quested that the receivership proceed
ings be . put off until Thursday, at
which time he will have her affairs in
some kind of shape. This was agreed
tn'and Mr. Newton and Mr. Carver
went back to boston on a. late train.
"Mr. Newton said that he had seen a
note for $500,000 which was given by
Mrs. Chadwick as collateral for a loan
from the Citizens' National Bank qX
Oberlin, O., which failed yesterday. My,
client told me that this note carried
the signature 'Andrew Carnegie.' This
will have to come out sooner or later,
so I shall tell it now."
MR. CARNEGIE'S DENIAL).
CONFERENCE OP CREDITORS.
The presence of Andrew Carnegie's
signature to the $500,000 note, it Is said,
makes Attorney Carver and Mr. New-,
ton believe that, there willbe a prompt
settlement. It Is even intimated 1 that
the settlement will be made in spite of
any liruof -that Carnegie's signature
was forged. Attorney Carver said to
night:
"In Mr. Newton's bill of complaint,
which has been filed in the suit against
Mrs. 'Chadwick, Newton alleges that
as an inducement for him to lend Mrs.
Chadwick $190,800, Mrs. ' Chadwick
showed him a note for $500,000, which
was signed by a man whom Mr. New
ton believed to be fully responsible as
one who could stand behind such a
loan as was required. I prefer not to
state what name was signed to the
note," but you can say that we do not
contradict the statement that the note
bore the signature of Andrew Carne
gie."
Carver stated in conclusion that Car
negie's repudiation of the note for
$500,000 was not at all expected.
A Boston dispatch says that the se
curities given by Mrs. Cassie Chadwick
frr $190,500. loaned to her by Newton,
are really worthless, but for reasons
which they will not discuss for publica
tion Xewton and his attorney believe
a settlement will be made before the
hearing in Cleveland next Thursday.
EXPECT CARNEGIE TO PAY.
At Oberlin, Ohio, it was learned that
Mrs. Chadwick had obtained loans
amounting to $240,000 from the Citizens'
National Bank and $102,000 from the
bank's president personally. The Car
negie note is believed to have been de
posited in this bank.
In Cleveland there was a "run" on
the Wade Park Bank, an institution
which is said to hold securities placed
by Mrs. Chadwick.
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â Sensational
developments in the case of Mrs. Cassie
Chadwick followed in rapid succession
to-day. George E. Ryall. local counsel
for Herbert B. Newton, who has
brought suit against Mrs. Chadwick,
said his client had told him of having
been shown a note for $500,000 by Mrs.
Chadwick. to which the name of An
drew Carnegie was signed. Carnegie
denied that he had ever seen Mis.
Chadwick or had any business dealing
with her. Â£h-K

said to be exclusive of the $102,000 lent
by President Beckwith 5 and Cashier
Spear personally to Mrs. Chadwick.
A meeting of the directors of the
failed Citizens* Bank was held to
night Director J7R. Randolph made
the startling announcement ; that the
signature on the collateral notes for
$F.00,000 and $250,000 on which Mrs.
Chadwick was loaned money was not
worth a dollar. He said he had seen
the notes and they were not signed by
Andrew Carnegie; that such a story
was ridiculous. In his opinion, Ran
dolph said, the signature did not add
a dollar to the value of the paper.
Ira Reynolds, secretary and treasurer
of the Wade -Park Banking Company,
refuses to make any statement con
cerning the notes given by Mrs. Chad
wick to his : bank as collateral and
which are also reported to bear the in
dorsement of Andrew Carnegie. There
is said to be a' possibility/ that the mo
tion for the appointment of a receiver
to take 'charge of the securities,
amounting to $5,000,000, held in trust by
Ira Reynolds for Mrs. Chadwick will
not come to an argument.. It was said
by one of the attorneys for Mrs. Chad

SLAV SOCIETIES GIVE BENEFIT.
A musical and literary entertain
ment for the benefit of the Russian
Red Cross Society was given last night
at Native Sons' Hall under the
auspices of the Slav-American com
mittee, in co-operation with tjie local
Slavonic societies.
An elaborate programme of instru
mental music and Slavonic solos with
Russian songs by a special ; quartet
and addresses by local Russians of
prominence occupied, the early part of
the evening. Among the speakers
were Dr. V. G. Vecki and the Rjew P.

came dancing and refreshments.

MUKDEN, Nov. 29. â The ; close
proximity of the opposing lines
in places is leading to new and unex
pected developments. Recently the
Japanese have been using dogs as
scouts, sending them out of the
trenches with long cords attached.
It Is almost impossible to detect these
wary animals, which unerringly locate
the Russian position and give warn
ing of any movement against the
Japanese. Some of the Russians have
managed, however, to strew the neu
tral ground with poisoned pork, thus
thinning the ranks of the dog scout
department.
A number of rockets were recently
sent up by the Japanese, in the hope,
apparently, of drawing the Russian

"The Aims of the Citizens' â¢ Alliance" was
the subject of a paper read by J. C. Craig,
president of the State Citizens' Alliance of
Colorado. The purpose of the Citizens' Al
liance, he .said, was not to antaconlze union
ism or to destroy the unions, but only to re
sist the unions in so far as their methods were
oppressive, unreasonable or unlawful.
If trades unionism should become dominant
In this country I have not the least doubt that
our industries would languish and our streets
would bÂ« filled with Idle men. No other re
sults could possibly come from a system that
would base the reward of labor, not on merit,
but on the power of organization to dictate
terms; a system that would restrict output,
discourage enterprise and permit the indolent
and least efficient to set the pace for in
dustry.
NEW YORK, Nov. 29. â Members of
the Citizens' .Industrial Association,
representing all sections of the coun

CHEFU, Nov. 29.â Chinese and Japa
nese advices received here to-day indi
cate that the assault on Port Arthur
which began on November 26 was still
in progress on the 27th. It is"*certain
that the fighting has been severe, but it
is not known whether the assault is
sufficiently widespread to be called gen
eral. The Chinese say that one train
of thirty cars arrived at Dalny with
wounded, but that no prisoners have
been captured.
As has frequently been indicated, the
Japanese positions are most promising
on Rihlung and Keekwan mountains,
and the attack was designed to further
increase the power of these positions. A
detachment of the Eleventh Division
began the advance, and this was fol
lowed by a bombardment and by rushes
against the trenches guarding the ap
proach to the southeastern fortified po
sitions on Keekwan Mountain. The
Japanese artillery was meanwhile
throwing all possible metal against
Rihlung and Antz mountains.
The possession of the trenches was
stubbornly contested, but after " five
hours', fighting and after having suf
fered several repulses the Japanese
drove the Russians out and destroyed
their trenches. Then, behind sandbags
which the infantry carried, the Japa
nese succeeded in intrenching them
selves. Later the Russians made a sor
tie,' which the Japanese say they re
pulsed after two hours' fighting.
PROGRESS OF ASSAUI/T.
BERLIN, Nov. 30.â A dispatch
from Tokio to the Taglische Rund
schau reports that the Japanese
storming of Port Arthur was aban
doned on November 28 because,
though large breaches had been made
in the Sungshu. Rihlung and Keek
wan forts, the Japanese were unable
to enter, on acount of the heavy flro
from the other, forts and the resist
ance of the garrisons.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 30, 3:28
a. m. â Foreign reports of the fighting
at Port Arthur are accepted here very
seriously. If the Japanese have tak
en 203-meter hill, as reported, com
manding the whole harbor, it is be
lieved that the situation is "critical.
Experts on Port Arthur topography
assert, however, that it is more .likely
that the Japanese have occunied somÂ«
positions at the base of the hiU and
believe that, owing to the concentrat
ed fire of the governing forts, the Jap
anese will find the top of the hill* un
tenable if they arrive there.
"Desperate fighting is proceeding:
daily and the losses are admitted to
be excessive, but the Japanese insist
that Port Arthur must fall within
twenty-one days."
BELIEVE REPORTS OVERDRAWN.
Bennett Burleigh wires* the Daily
Telegraph from Chefu that in the last
assault the Japanese lost 400 men in
one hour's fighting. They claim to
have captured two more of the north
eastern forts and a third, which is
part of the west Keekwan fort. They
claim, Burleigh adds, to have effected
a lodgment at Pigeon Bay, thus turn
ing the fort on 203-meter hill, and
that they are row tunneling from the
gorge below Laoti Hill, which they
hope first to damage and then to rush.
The dispatch continues:
LONDON, Nov. 30. â According to
a Tokio dispatch to the Standard
there is an unofficial rumor that the
Japanese hauled large caliber guns to
the top of 203-meter hill, whence
their fire has a sweep of the whole
harbor. This report doubtless goes
beyond the facts, but various dis
patches indicate the progress the
Japanese are making in the reduction
of Port Arthur.

The prosecution rested its case this
morning after taking the testimony of
several new . witnesses and recalling
others", who were on the stand yester
day. The main trend of "their evidence
was that there was wholesale repeat
ing by Democrats in Precinct 8 of
Ward 5. . " .
A feature of the testimony to'day
was the statement of Kratke that Os
car Anderson, who served as a Repub
lican challenger, a resident of Precinct
8 of Ward 5. had come to him on elec
tion day and offered to vote his entire
family for the Democratic ticket for
the sum of $5. Previous to this Ander-*
son had denied having made any such
offer.
DENVER, Nov. 29.â The taking of
testimony was continued to-day in the
election contempt cases before the Su
preme Court. Several of the defend
ants were on the witness stand, in
cluding Frank Kratke, chief license
inspector. Both Kratke and Alder
man Michael Mahoney denied having
shown any discourtesy to the Supreme
Court watchers, thus refuting the
testimony given yesterday. They also
denied that Alfred Weimer was forced
out of the polling booth because he
asked for a second ballot upon discov
ering that the one handed him was al-,
ready marked.
Kratke. Edward O'Mailia, Charles
Kofsky and other defendants as well
as Alderman Mahoney and other wit
nesses swore that there was no re
peating as far as they knew in Precinct
8 of Ward 5. City and County Clerk
Julius Aichele testified that no such
name as Doud appeared on the regis
tcation and poll books of that precinct.
Jt was claimed by the Republicans that
Doud was a resident of the precinct
a.nd would swear, to having voted re
peatedly upon solicitation of the Dem
ocratic workers if he was grauted im
munity from arrest.
Examination of the ground this morn
ing showed â¢ that the men who were
firing have powerful guns. . They were
stationed from one-half to three-quar
ters of a mile from the town. Almost a
bushel of empty shells of various sizes
were 'picked up in the woods. A trail
of blood was found on a rail fence, arid
this leads to the supposition that at
least one person was wounded.
Assistant Adjutant General Reece and
the Carbondale militia company arrived
at Zeiffler to-day, and General Reece
will remain several days to investigate
the situation. It is believed that more
troops will be brought.
Joseph " Leiter reached Zeigler to-day
with more miners from Chicago.
BENTON, 111., Nov. 29.â feigler was
fired upon last night from sundown to
daylight. It is estimated that no less
than 500 shots were fired at the town.
The town was completely surrounded
and the firing came from every quar
ter. Response to this fusillade was
made with four Gatling guns placed at
various Doints about the mine build-
Ings.

Much interepting speculation as to

changes. The retention ef every one

big man, but that would mean anchor-
* ge \u Se ?T eta^ y Taft is directly in line
for the Presidency in 1K6 and though
he might have- the high and perma
nent place. the Presidency in prospec
tive may cause him to retain his war
portfolio to await developments.
In the light of the returns, to recall
thut expression is to laugh. Of course
it w uld never have been uitered here,
where few, votes are to be influenced,
if it had not been deemed certain that
this big minority vote was forthcoming.
Since the election all the Washington
papers have freely attributed the ex
traordinary result to the personal qual
ity of the President, a stamp of ap
proval upon just him. And so saying
there is a general throwing away of
that anxiety that was represented in
tht v.:*h for a big minority.
But if the fear of unsafeness in the
President no longer causes alarm it
does not mean that interest in what
he t-hail do has died with it. This in
terest is enhanced by the announce
ment that he was not a candidate for
re-election, thus leaving him free the
four years to work without suspicion.
The President's obligation to McKin
ley is cancekd also with the 4th of
March. So it is expected he will in
augurate a policy bearing his individu
al Slamp an.- fcr which he desires to
bear the undivided responsibility. It
is not likely that the people will long
be left to guess what is to distinguish
it, or at least what is be its general

cause the forthcoming message to Con
cress to be the most widely read of all
public documents ef recent years.
CABINET SPECULATION.
After the adjournment of Congress
and as the election drew near Wash
ingrion, in common with other cities,
became /affected with the feeling that
dominated the North and West, but
did not begin to realize the avalanche
impending until the votes were count
ed, and that method which had af
fronted a few was seen, to have won
the applause ot the multitude.
So tar as it is allowable to speak it
in public the Washington mind is
fairly represented by Washington
cewBpapera. These are all with the
administration â with reservations.
One of them more than once during
the campaign, and the last time a fijw
days before the election, expressed the
opinion that while Roosevelt's election
Was to be desired, so also was a good,
big minority vote, adding that a
sweeping victory would be deplorable.
It is a fact that on the Sth of No
vember, JV03 â that is to say. a year
ago or a. littlÂ£ more â that immense
popularity of 'the President that .has
btt-n testified to throughout all the

ing sermons in the Senate, and almost
as often on the Republican as upon
ihc Democratic side.
To be sure the cited cases had their
defenders, who explained and cited
precedents, but without'.creating mucti
impression. It was simply an expres
sion, so generally recognized, of irri
tation, senatorial dignity was con
stantly being Jarred by the president's
energetic method. This irritation was
communicated generally and there
was that feeling throughout the capi
tal such as gave the Democrats the
cui? for their campaign motto of "Safe
and sane." Perhaps the direct con
tact which Washington has with posi
tive Democratic territory, Maryland,
Virginia and the South, had some
thing to do with it also, but whatever
the explanation, it is true that here,
where the President lives, the one
sided character of the election was
<iuite as much of a surprise as it was
in New York.
HIS MAJORITY A SURPRISE.
WASHIXQTOX, Nov. 29.â It is a
rather curious circumstance that all
the apprehension- that existed in
Washington a year ago^s to what
liooseveit Mould do. witli this United
Stales^if it- was his has disappeared
eincct his recent, demonstration tbat it
is hi?. Nobody seems to have the least
alarm.
fices, it is Roosevelt's leaning toward
tariff- revision that excites real inter
est. Every politician, Member of Con
gress or prominent -man visiting the
city, err that, has visited the White
House, has run the gauntlet of the in
terviewer. There has" been "a constant
stream of these visitors of a very se
lect sort since the electionâ some'pf the
meat prominent of stand-patters, as
.well as. leaders of the revision idea.
Of these the revisionists have in their
enthusiasm all been ready to talk and
have therefore got much the better of
the advertising.
Governor Cummings of 'Iowa, repre
sentative of the one time, Iowa' idea
that put ex-Speaker "Henderson first
out of patience and then out of politics,
tc-ok the occasion of a visit to Wash
ington' to talk to the President on this
subject and to give revision, a, boom.
Eugene N. Foss of Massachusetts, the
special champion of reciprocity, partic
ularly with Canada, and Babcock of
Wisconsin, who makes tariff 'revision
bis specialty, have all had .an inning
at the White House and'in the 1 newspa
pers. Even Representative McCleary
of Minnesota, who believes" in revising
the tariff >up ward, has come to town
in a very tractable mood. The easy
manners of the revisionists may have
their warrant in ; the President's sym
pathy with them. -/They; know that' it
was Ins efforts that; secured -; the "plank
in the Republican platform which
promises revision, though not in a very
errphatic l way. -; They know that the
mild language of 'Â¦ th^ plank was not
the President's,' but.thatjof ; the' stand
pattersâit was in' the 'nature of a'con-
There has been a good deal said
about the intention of Moody to retire
to the private practice of law with
the 1st of January, but Moody, by the
President's wish, will prosecute for the
Government for some time at least and
probably in some very important cases.
Secretary Wynne will very likely
place to Cortelyou in the Post
office Department. As for Secretary of
Agriculture Wilson, a change in that
direction has never been thought of,
cither by Wilson or the President.
The Cabinet probabilities at this md"
ment, . therefore, are: Secretary of
State, John Hay; Secretary of the
Treasury. Paul Morton; Secretary of
War, William H. Taft; Attorney,Gen
eral W. H. Moody; Postmaster Gen
eral, G. B. Cortelyou; Secretary of the
Navy, ; Secretary of "the Inte
rior, Victor HJj Metcalf; Secretary of
Agriculture, James Wilson; Secretary
of Commerce and Labor, .
Inasmuch as the retirement of any of
the members has not been definitely
announced, it is a little early to men
tion the names of their successors. A
strong plea is, however, being made
that the South be represented in the
reorganized Cabinet. And in this con
nection a protest has been filed against
considering Missouri as of the South.
Missouri r.:ay be now charged to the
West in -a political classification.
DIPIXXMATIC CHANGES.
Missouri, it is charged, is south for
some, expedient purposes and weet for
others. Now that it has gone Repub
lican, attention is especially called t(j.
the fact that Missouri is in the West
by the geography, and that the West
is represented in the Cabinet by Mor
ton of Illinois, Taft of Ohio, Wilson of
Iowa, John Hay, who, though he now
Figns himself of the District of Colum
bia, hails originally from the Middle
West, especially Ohio, and by Metcalf
of California. Republicans of the solid
Democratic South, who labor for Re
publican principles, and with so little
hope of reward, are urging the names
of prominent Republicans in their
ranks.
The new administration is expected
to witness a number of changes in the
diplomatic and consular service, the
postal, internal revenue and customs
service. It is understood that Embas
sador Choate will voluntarily retire
from the court of St. James and return
to the United States, and that Embas-
F.ador Porter at Paris will do the same.
Minister Conger will doubtless be suc
ceeded by W. W. Rockhill, chief of the
Bureau of American Republics. Suc
cessors are likely to be named to Pow
ell Clayton, Embassador to Mexico,
and Meyer at Rome, and changes are
intimated as likely at Tokio, Berlin.
St. Petersburg and Vienna, as well as
other important points in Europe and
South America.
The recent report of Third Assistant
Secretary of State Peirce, who went
abroad for the special purpose of look
ing into the consular service and de
termining the truth of some ugly things
said about it, would indicate some very
sweeping changes to be made.
FIGHT FOR REVISION.
But turning from the question of of-
business career, accepted with the un
derstanding, that the 4th of March was
the limit. With no experience what
ever in politics or governmental af
fairs, he has developed a taste for both
through his admiration for the Presi
dent, but he Is a devotee of the strenu
ous life himself and he finds the navy
very easy. The vice presidency of the
Santa Fe has been kept open for Mor
ton with its 125,000 a year. Then there
,is the. presidency of that road offering
in prospective. Nevertheless, there is
excellent reason to believe that Morton
will remain in the President's official
family. ;?."â¢
SHAW MAY DROP OUT.
Despite the urgent petitions in his
behalf from "Western bankers and
financiers, in sDite of the heroic work
he performed during the campaign and
for which he has been thanked by the
President, in spite of the generally ac
knowledged high abilitv he has dis
played in the conduct of his respon
sible office, in spite even of a known
desire on his part to nil out four years
of service, no assurance of any slight
degree has so far been given by the
President that the resignation of Shaw,
tendered as it will be with, all the oth
ers on the 4th of March, will not be
accepted. In that case, it is intimated,
Morton will be transferred to the
Treasury. Shaw's place. Here it is
said Morton would find opportunity for
the display of special talents, evidence
of the possession of which he has giv
en in financing the Saiita Fe, a gigantic
undertaking at the time, but very suc
cessfully accomplished. Even should
this transfer be made and found to be
agreeable to Morton, it is not likely
that he will remain more than another
year.
Secretary MetcaJf, another recent ap
pointee of the President, and who gave
up the certainty of being returned to
the House, will also be asked to remain
a member of the Cabinet. Should Sec
retary Hitchcock retire, as it is likely
he will do, it is altogether likelv that

seven choice, new upright pianos .were
sold, making sixteen sales for the day.
We want buyers to-day for several
slightly used pianos. Among them are
included, nearly, every, prominent Ameri-

My dÂ»ar Doctor Selfridpe â Though I thanked
Lolita at the ferry for the lovely flowers you
sent with jour Rood wishes on my departure.
I hÂ«vÂ« Intended .writing: you before this and
thank you myself for your kindness, but some
how on thÂ» steamer I could not write, so hopÂ«
you will accept these late but sincere thanks.

have nut se*n much of London. Have met

all strange here. London la a terribly busy
place; we hardly reallie what a small place
we are out on the coast until we arrive here.
Tb* shows are sdendld and there ' are plenty
to go find see. Yesterday I met Grace Eileston
while shopping. She was looking very pretty;
Inquired I about you | all at home. She is not
playing here; she-is with Mrs. La Moyne. I
expect to see her, again in a few. days. .'

the witness that Miss Dolbeer's mental
condition then was sound. "She was
perfectly rational," asserted Miss Dean.
JUDGE CURBS SPIRIT.
The cross-examination of Redick Mc-
Kee Duperu was finished shortly after
the trial began In the morning. By
â¢nay of caution Judge Coffey gave coun
sel and witness to understand that they
must curb any disposition to quarrel.
Duperu said that Miss Warren, the
chief beneficiary, undoubtedly "was first
in the affection of Miss Dolbeer, and
Mrs. Douglas Sloane Watson second.
Frederick A. Jennings told of his ne
gotiations with Miss Dolbeer shortly
before -she departed for Europe for
painting and repairing her house. She
was intelligent and rational in all deal-
Ings, said the witness.
The day Bertha Dolbeer made her
will. April 23, 1904, she called at the
parlors of Mrs. Hermina Baer and or
dered a gown. Mrs. Baer ahd her hus
band, Joseph Baer, testified yestyday
that the testatrix acted intelligently
and sanely and that there was abso
lutely nothing different from the usual
In her manner.
It transpired that in fitting for the
new gown the model Miss Dolbeer had
used the year before . could be used
again. This is regarded as an Im
portant point, because It contradicts
contestant's contention that she had
become thinner because of melancholia.
Mrs. Lolita Selfridge, wife of Dr. Sel
fridge, knew Bertha Dolbeer Intimately
the past five years, she testified. A
short time before Miss Dolbeer left for
Europe the witness talked with her of
her trip and of. the plans to remodel
her house at 2112 Pacific avenue. Among
other things Miss Dolbeer said that
when she returned from - abroad she
would have the hallway reconstructed
and would buy a team and- carriage.
"I am very fond of pictures, .and I
suggested that she should have more of
them on her walls," continued Mrs.
Selfridge. "I told her she ought to buy
some paintings while in Europe, and
ought to purchase some of the local
artists* work. One of the names I men
tioned was Keith's, and she said she
had an old one of his paintings that her
father purchased twenty years ago. I
laughed at this appreciation of Keith.
"The thought struck her then that,
she would buy one of Keith's ' latest
paintings and hang it opposite the old
one to 6how what Improvement the
painter has made in twenty years. Miss
Dolbeer. said she .would do this on her
return."
URGED . "REST CURE."
The witness was. present when her
husband told Miss Dolbeer that she
ought to take a course of the "rest
cure" before starting on the trip \\ to
Europe.
"You Â¦Â¦'Â¦have been, going out very
much and you will enjoy your trip the
better," was the reason Dr. : Self ridge
urged.' He added:" "The , rest cure .is
what I prescribe for -my wife when
she becomes worn out." , '.-,-_ . . .-,:
The witness was also i at' the ferry
with the merry company to "bid . Miss
Dolbeer good-by when- she. started for
Europe. An enthusiastic gentleman
friend cave Miss Dolbeer an Ameri
can flag, which he insisted she should
carry- through the gate j and on .to the
boat. She protested and v there was

Miss Ethel Dean held most important
place in the trial of the Dolbeer will
contest yesterday. Not alone* was her
testimony important. The artists who
were there for the newspapers became
enthusiastic. The lawyer who cross
examines with bo much zeal was over
whelmed by the naivete and the loveli
ness. He floundered when he tried to
ply the witness with the hot fire of
questions that is calculated to bring out
flaws and weaknesses In testimony.
She escaped much of the rigor other
witnesses have been subjected to in
cross-examination.
Miss Dean was attired in one of those
natty gowns of brown that fashion dic
tates with such rare taste these days.
The plume and the hat made the sym
phony of coloring in dress complete.
The pretty young society girl was a
rery important witness for the pro
ponents of the will, inasmuch as she
visited and conversed â¢with Miss Dol
beer la New York a few days before
the testatrix met her death, and she
gave the opinion that the testatrix was
at that time of perfectly sound mind.
They had long been friends, in fact, in
timate friends. Miss Dean was In New
Tork last summer, and when Miss Dol
beer returned from Paris called on her
at the Waldorf-Astoria four days be
fore the fatal fall from the window.
The testatrix was Indisposed from a
cold and In bed. They talked for an
tour. Miss Dolbeer being in happy
frame of mind.
Two days later Miss Dean met Miss
Dolbeer and Miss Warren shopping at
Sterns' and .accompanied them to the
Waldorf for luncheon. That day. said
the witness, the testatrix was looking
very well.
"She appeared to be thinner than
Â¦wh*>n I last saw her In San Francisco."

WELL, KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE SMART SET OX THEIR WAY TO JUDGE
COFFEY'S COURTROOM TO TESTIFY FOR THE PROPONENTS OF THE
TYILL OF THE LATE BERTHA M. DOLBEER.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29â Some time
ago, at the request of Postmaster Gen
eral Wynne, the President directed the
Attorney General to submit to him an
opinion as to the status, under the law
restricting the operation of lottery en
terprises through the mails, of guess
ins contests of various kinds. That
opinion was submitted to-day. It is of
a most sweeping character, and while
the Poltmaster General has no incli
nation to work a hardship upon any
body, he will put the Attorney Gen
eral's judgment into effect as soon as
may be practicable. The Attorney
General says the schemes are in effect
lotteries under the guise of guessing
contests. To-night he gave out the
following official statement:
For a number of years the Postofflce Depart
ment had admitted to the mails advertisements
and other matter concerning so-called "guess
ing" or "estimating" contests. The question
of whether or not these schemes are lotteries
has been several times presented to the Attor
ney General, who held that they were not lot
teries within the meaning: of the postal lottery
act.
In view of two recent cases, In which the
Supreme Court and the New York Court of
Appeals rendered opinions, the Postmaster
General felt warranted In again submitting
the question to the Attorney General. Follow
ing the opinions in these cases the Attorney
Gcnoral holds that the schemes are lotteries.
It in. therefore. Incumbent upon the Post
offloo Department to enforce the law under
which the Postmaster General Is authorized,
upon evidence satisfactory to him that any
person or company is engaged In conducting a
lottery or other scheme for the distribution
cf money on chance, to issue an order that all
mail addressed to such person or company be
returned stamped "Fraudulent.'*
As a number of legitimate enterprises have
adopted these estimating or guessing contents
as a means of advertising, and in view of the
admlxslon to the mails of matter pertaining
to these contests within the last few years,
the elimination of these schemes from the
mails cannot be made immediately absolute.
If such a scheme has ever been entered upon in
good faith the dep*ttment will rot issue an
order that will seriously injure a legitimate
business. . Bach cape will be handled separate
ly and no scheme which involves the plan rulod
apainst by tl:e Attorney General will .here
after be allowed to commence operations.

BAKERSFIELD, Nov. . 29.â The pro
ducers In the Kern River oil fields yes
terday received word from the Standard
Oil Company that, the company will
buy no more "spot" oil at present, and
the office of the company in the field
has been advised to that effect.
For. some weeks past and ever since
the independent producers were assured
of effecting an organization the Stand
ard has been paying 15 cents for "spot"
oil, and many of the companies found
in this a method of disposing of their
product and securing funds for the
conduct of their business. It is argued
by many, and among them those who
are close to the agency, that the move
ment of the Standard Is directly In the
interest of the combine, in that it will
have a tendency to force those pro
ducers who have remained outside the
agency to cast their fortunes with the
independents, and so place ali the inde
pendent oil in the field in the hands of
the agency, with which, the theory Is,
the Standard expects to do business in
the future.
Â¦ At the office of the independents to
day no word had come from President
McQuigg, who is now In San Francisco,
relative to the latest order of the
Standard, and the officials of the com
bine are in the dark as to the meaning
of the movement. There is a general
sentiment, however, in favor of the Idea
that it is the Intention of the Standard
to assist in strengthening the organiza
tion of the agency rather than to
weaken it.

CHICAGO, Nov. 29.â Affidavits from
fifteen persons were read by Judge
Dunne to-day in an effort to unravel
the marital troubles of Benedetta Al
legretti, charged with having , two
wives. -The hearing ended in a refusal
by the Judse to grant Mrs. Elizabeth
Allegretti of San Francisco temporary
alimony. . . â¢
From the affldlvats submitted, it was
shown that. within a few doors of each
other Mrs. Elizabeth and Mrs. Rose Al
legretti lived, each believing herself the
only wife of the defendant. Allegretti's
friends swore they know he lived with
Mrs. Rose, and friends of the com
plainant declared he lived with Mrs.
Elizabeth at the same time. There
were children in both homes.
Mrs. Elizabeth met her husband in
San Francisco at the. home of her
mother on Chesley street. She tells
in an affidavit of her discovery of his
alleged faithlessness and how she be
came aware of his second family.
- "I was a girl of 16 years," says Mrs.
AllegrettJ No. 1, "when I met Benedet
ta in San Francisco. He begged me to
be his wife. I consented and he placed
a ring, upon my finger, as a pledge of
our marriage."
Mrs. Allegretti says her husband de
serted her in December, 1896, leaving
her with a small child. It took her
four years to flnd"out he had come to
Chicago and had a candy store at 108
Clark street.
To her surprise, Mrs. Allegrettl's first
letter to her recreant husband was an
swered. She declares he begged her to
come to Chicago with her little one.
Later Mrs. Allegretti says her husbanc
sent her money and she Joined him in
Chicago. They went to live at 735
Wells street. After a few months her
husband represented he was making
too little to keep her in Chicago, but
promised if she would return to San
Francisco to send her money regularly.
Allegretti denies ever having married

SALINAS, Nov. 29.â A plucky little
woman armed with a revolver took all
the courage out of a. big, burly tramp
bent upon robbery. here this morning.
The woman is Mrs. Ada Martin, a
widow, who with her, daughter resides
in the residence portion of the town.
The identity of the tramp is unknown,
as such was the speed he displayed in
getting out of range of the weapon held
by Mrs. Martin that the authorities
have been unable to locate him.
The encounter occurred at an early
Hour this morning-. Mrs. Martin was
awakened by the sound made by some
one trying to raise the window of the
bedroom occupied by herself and
daughter. She is a very plucky wom
an, and instead of losing her nerve and
screaming she kept, quiet -and awaited
developments. Soon she saw the head
and shoulders of the tramp at the win
dow. Then she reached for her revolver,
and as the intruder stepped into the
room she pointed the weapon at him
and was about to fire when her daugh
ter grabbed her arm and begged her
not to kill him..
The tramp heard the words. Like a
flash he turned and faced the bed. The
one look was enough. He did not like
the appearance of the big revolver held
by Mrs. Martin and made a break for
the window. His exit was made in
much quicker time than his entry, and
by the time the woman had summoned
help and told her story no trace of the
burly intruder could be found.
AUBURN, Nov. 29.â Adolph Weber
was in court to-day during the time
that his counsel were questioning the
talesmen as to their opinions on the
Weber tragedy. As Weber came down
stairs he met Lincoln Merrow in the
Sheriff's office. Merrow was the school
mate of the accused youth who stayed
with him the night of the murder at
the home of Adrian - Wills. At that
time Merrow knew nothing of any
murder having been committed, believ
ing that- the Weber family was simply
burned to death. When Merrow and
Weber shook hands to-day Weber
asked Merrow: "What do the people
think about this, anyhow?"
"The sentiment seems to be all one
way," replied Merrow. ''
"What is your opinion?" said Weber.
"Well, I'll tell you," answered Mer
row,. "It looks pretty dark for you. I
would give a good deal to see you
proven innocent, but if you are guilty
I want to see you punished."
While passing from the Sheriff's of
fice into the Jail Weber noticed the
headline in a San Francisco paper:
"Banker Lubeck claims the money."
"He does, does he," he remarked
sotto voce," we'll see."
Following is the personnel of the
new grand jury selected to-day: Rob
ert Hector, foreman; J. M. Newman,
Dave Jones, T. H. McKenna, Owen
Clark, Thomas Robinson, E. E. Scott,
James Rasmussen, E. C. Fellows,

Joseph Clegg, John Henny, John Vieh
meier, E. S. Atkins. Albert Maring, W.
H. Curtis, A. H. Hubbard and H. F.

Many persons are now coming for
ward with the information that they
suspected young Weber of the bank
robbery at the time. "If these 'know
it-all' parties had told their suspicions
to Sheriff Keena," said an officer to
day, "this awful murder would have
been prevented. They are in a meas
ure responsible for the crime."

President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, was
solicited to-day for exact and authentic
news of the fate of the fourteen seniors
upon whose cases Captain Nance has
made report to the president, but de
spite all appeals from the anxious men
and their friends no news was given
out that tended to allay' the anxieties
or confirm the fears of the seniors who
are In suspense and have been for three
weeks.
President Wheeler explained that he
purposes consulting the parents of the
men who are accused by Captain
Nancn. Because the president states
that he is going to write to the parents
of the men before taking action it is
the general belief In the university that
Nance has recommended severe punish
ment for most of the fourteen men.
No news of the fate of the accused is
to be given- out by the authorities until
replies from the parents of the men af
fected have been received. The presi
dent refuses to give the names of the
men, and Captain Nance is equally reti
cent, pursuing: the course that he has
maintained since the beginning of his
conflict with the senior class.

There is~ a hitch in the organization
of the Board of Engineers that is to in
vestigate the Bay Cities Water Com
pany's properties with relation to the
proposal to install a municipal water
supply of 20,000,000 gallons a day
for Oakland. I The company's repre
sentative, A: M. Hunt, and City En
gineer F. C. Turner, after three confer
ences to-day, failed to" reach an agree
ments to the third engineer who shall
be chosen to complete the board.
City Engineer Turner has selected an
engineer, whose identity he will not
disclose, as the man he desires shall
be that third representative on the
commission. The name was presented
to Engineer Hunt and did not prove
satisfactory. Turner in return an
nounced practically that he should in
sist upon his man's being named. Hunt
replied by submitting several names,
none of which appealed to Turner.
In explanation of his position. Turner
said to-night:
. "The city of Oakland has a great
deal at stake in this matter. I feel
certain that the third man on this
board, who might have, a deciding voice
in the report, should be one satisfactory
to me as the representative of Oakland.
In other words it seems to me that the
city should have the naming of the odd
man. The engineer whom I have in
mind' is, in my opinion, the best man
on the coast for the work that is ahead
of us. I feel quite insistent on this
point because of the city's, vast inter
ests. While Mr. Hunt has not definite
ly refused to accept my man he has not
looked upon him with fa"~r."
Further conference will be held to
morrow.
He was appointed to the military
academy from California in 1875, was
appointed second lieutenant In the

Just a year ago that Smith was killed
at Fourteenth and Jackson streets by
one of two men whom he had stopped
as suspicious characters. In the pistol
duel Frank Goldstein was killed by
Smith. As to his connection, Kiniry has
admitted that he was in Oakland with
Goldstein the night of the shooting,
that they were out together to commit
crime, that they met a police officer
near the scene of the shooting. All of
this Kiniry told the Chief of Police, but
there he stopped. Hodgkins said to
night that Kiniry talked of vital points
in the story. Kiniry had little to say at
the orison and objected to being ques
tioned concerning the murder charge.
He said he should not be expected to
tell his case. Precautions were taken
to prevent Kiniry from doing harm to
himself. He appeared to have well re
covered from the effects of 'the bullet
wounds in his leg and his wrist Inflict
ed at Los Angeles by Watchman Hen

EARTi OF HARDWICKE DEAD.
Madame Janauschek had the same
hold on the affections of the public as
have Mrs. Gilbert. Clara Morris and
Madame Modjeska. She was a Bo
hemian by- birth and had reached the
age of 74. She became prominent as
an actress first in her. own country and
later in Germany. In 1867 she came to
the United States, first performing In
German, and after a thorough study of
the English language she appeared in
such characterizations as Deborah,
Mary Stuart, Queen Elizabeth, Lady
Macbeth, Meg Merrillles and Biantea.
Her retirement from the stage was an
nounced in 1891. but the next year she
appeared in a play entitled "The Har
vest Home." Several years later she
again appeared in "The Great Dia
mond Robbery," interpreting the char
acter of a typical eastside "fence"
keeper.
It was in July, 1900. that Madame
Janauschek first suffered from an at
tack of paralysis. She went to St.
Mary's Hospital, remaining there for
six months. She then went to Saratoga
Springs and remained there under the
constant care of Dr. James E. Kelly of
that place.
On April 12, 1901, a benefit perform
ance was given for her at Wallack's
Theater, in which many prominent ac
tors and actresses took part. This gave
her approximately $.*>00O. In her later
yenrs Madame Janauschek lost all he
wealth" and was forced to sell the cos
tumes ; she had used in her previous
lengthy stage career as well as her
cherished troDhips

The j>lea for mercy is made by Kel
legg on the ground that he took
trifling rums to pay debts contracted
Â¦while his wife was sick, and that when
he feared these thefts would "be found
out he became so frantic that he lost
eelf-control, stole about $150 and de
camped with the money. His salary in
the postoffice was $50 a month. He
married, and says it was almost impos
sible for him to pay expenses, hence
the stealings which he now admits.
Postmaster Schmidt told Kellogg that
the case could not be controlled by the
local office, but must go to the Federal
authorities. Inspector L. H. Bricker
was called in. He took no action to
ward arresting Kellogg, merely laying
the facts of the case before United
States District Attorney Marshall
Woodworth in San Francisco.
With a pathetic plea for mercy ac
companying the act, Oliver M. Kellogg,
the self-confessed postofflce embezzler.
to-day turned over to Postmaster
Echmidt 5104 11, the full amount of the
money taken by him three months ago.
Xellogg disappeared from Berkeley
when he felt apprehensive that his
Ftealings would be detected and fled to
tbe southern part of the State. He left
a Â«ick wife, to whom a child was born
shortly after he disappeared. When the

he hurried home and has been in Berke

the members of hi? family have known

The SuDreme Court la attempting: to
make an even division of the appeal
cases now pending in order to give the
new district courts something to do.
The number of contests submitted and
not* yet decided is approximately 900.
The amendment specifies the character
of cases to be considered by each
tribunal.
The Justices of the Â¦ Supreme Court
hold that they will have absolute con
trol of the district courts, and may take
for themselves Just what proportion of
the appeals they choose. The Supreme
Court will also prepare all rules of pro
cedure for the district courts. The new
tribunal uill.in fact, be merely an of
ficial assistant, whose work shall al
ways be subject to revision. It is ex
pected, however, "that only in extraor
dinary instances will the district courts'
decisions be reviewed and reversed.
The Justices state that they mean to
divide the work equally. How the plan
of division furnished in the amendment
will operate cannot be told until pend
ing cases are segregated. The Justices
are taking no official action in the mat
ter of recommending candidates to the
Governor, but thev feel that the pres
ent Supreme Court Commissioners
could properly perform the duties as
signed to the district courts.
The present plan is to get the new
tribunals to work as early as Febru
ary. The Governor can make his ap
pointments and the Legislature' can
provide the necessary salaries by that
time. : :'
Under existing laws the Supreme
Court has to make . semi-annual pil
grimages to Los . Angeles and Sacra
mento, and this practice will have to be
continued until the Leslslature pro
vides otherwise. It is expected that the
law will be changed so as to allow the
court to remain permanently In San
Francisco within a few "years.

Democrats here say that* not only
should Mariposa be given the banner,
but that Baxter should be made its sole

The Right Honorable Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, Premier of Canada, and the
idol of the Liberal party of the
Dominion, accompanied by Lady
Laurier, Mrs. Edwards, wife of Sena
tor Edwards of Canada, and Miss Cou
tu, arrived in this city from the East
late yesterday afternoon and are at the
Palace Hotel. The Premier has come
to California for a much needed rest
after the fatiguing experiences of a
hard political campaign, and it is his
intention to remain in the State about
two weeks. En route to the coast he
visited the St. Louis exposition, which
he enjoyed, and then proceeded west
ward direct to "San Francisco.
"Sir Wilfrid Laurier is not a well
man," said his secretary. R. Bondreau.
last evening at the Palace, "and in
view of this fact he purposes to enjoy
as much quiet as his journey will per;
mit. For that reason he is not allow
ing himself to be interviewed notwith
standing the fact that he has been
quoted by several papers regarding va
rious matters. From here we ex
pect to go to Monterey and then pro
ceed down the coast to Los Angeles,
from which place our homeward Jour
ney wi!l begin."
Last evening the Premier and his
party dined at the Palace and then re-
< tired to their, rooms for the night. To
; day they will visit Chinatown and'
j Golden Gate Park, and in the afternoon
I they will depart for the Hotel del Mcn
j'te, where they expect to remain sever
1 al days.
! Sir Wilfrid Laurier is of striking ap
; pearance, and a man of genial dispo
j sition who readily makes friends, a
; fact that was thoroughly demonstrated
J in his last campaign, which terminated
I in great success. He is regarded as one
| of the best speakers m Canada- and
j ever since he entered politics in the Do
| minion he has been looked upon as
! a very strong man. Since the retire-
I ment of Mr. Blake he has been the ac
knowledged leader of the Liberals.
The Premier is native of St. Lin, L'As
somption. Province of Quebec, and was
born in November, 1841. Although he
began his career as a lawyer He later
j entered the journalistic field, and for a
j time he edited Le Defricheur. He was
j a member of the Quebec Assembly
from 1871 to 1874 and in the latter year
he was elected a member of the Do
minion Parliament. He was also Min
ister of Inland Revenue and bears the
distinction of being the first French
Canadian to be elected Premier of Can
ada. His wife was formerly a Miss
Zoe Lafontaine of Montreal and Is
credited with having been responsible
for much of the public success of her
distinguished husband.

The band was playing when the trag
ic incident occurred. It was so start
ling that great confusion prevailed,
but doctors at once arrived and Chap
man was conveyed to his room. He
succumbed almost immediately. .The
body was removed' to a mortuary in
order to await the inquest, which will
take place Thursday.
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â Elverton R.
Chapman, the young man who commit
ted suicide in a sensational manner in
a London hotel last night, was the son
of E. R. Chapman, senior member of
the firm of E. R. Chapman & Co.,
bankers, of this city. <
Young Chapman had recently gradu
ated from Oxford. He visited his home
here early in the present year. Dur
ing his. stay here he appeared to be in
excellent health, both physically and
mentally, and his friends say they are
unable to account for his strange ac
tion in taking his life.
LONDON, Nov. 29.â Elverton Chap
mnn. aped 23, whose home is' in New
York City, committed suicide last night
at the Carleton Hotel by throwing him
self from the third floor landing to
the vestibule, where he was shockingly
mangled on the marble floor: pHis- skull
was crushed, one arm shattered and
there were other injuries from which
he died in terrible agony within a few
minutes.
Chapman arrived at the
from Paris last Saturday, accompanied
by his valet. He complained of ill
health and the management suspected
that his mind was unhinged, so a man
was detailed to watch him. Chapman
remained in his room all Monday. After
dressing for dinner last evening he left
his room, and, upon arriving at the
head of the staircase, suddenly eluded
the attendant, sprang forward, cleared
the banister and fell three flights to the
ground. The vestibule was filled with
well dressed men and women who were
proceeding to the dining hall. In his
fall he narrowly escaped striking the
wife of the Mexican Minister, General
Callardo.
BANKER'S SON
ENDS HIS LIFE
The boycott had been declared on Oc
tober 5 because McCrosky would not
accede to the demands of the union
regulating wages and hours of pay.
Pickets were placed around the place
of business and circulars were sent to
the firm's customers requesting them
to withdraw their patronage. The firm
employed more than forty . men, only
six of whom belonged to the union,
and these six were called on strike. The
witn-ss said he had seen the pickets
take his men by the arms and argue
with them, and interfere with their
work There had, however, been no
violence. He said that the union men
in his employ had told him that they
were afraid to go to work for fear of
the union.
. H. W. Hutton, attorney for the un
ion, attempted to question McCrosky
regarding what he had said to B. B.
Rosenthal. business agent for the un
ion, at the time the demands were
made, but the questions were ruled out
on the objection that the evidence was
hearsay. Judge Hebbard instructed
Hutton to desist from examining upon
union and non-union issues, as the
point in the case related only to the
injury of the acts complained of.
. Edward Parker, an employe, testi
fied that he was a member of the un
ion, but withdrew from it when the
boycott was ordered.
After Parker's examination the court
asked Hutton to present his side of the
case. He responded that he had no
evidence to offer, whereupon judgment
was ordered entered for . the plaintiff
granting a perpetual injunction.
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted a
perpetual injunction against the Uphol
sterers* Union, Local No. 28, which has
been boycotting the Crescent Feather
Company. The trial of the case open
ed Monday morning, but was interrupt
ed by Isaac Selby's vengeful attempt
to take Judge Hebbard's life. Yester
day morning Leonard H. McCrosky, vice
president and manager of the feather
company, testified as to the union's
acts under the questioning of Attorney
Bush Finnell.

Official returns of the late election !
are now in the hands of Secretary of !
State Curry, and at his instance State
Printer Shannon has completed a list of
the members of the next Legislature. ;
The document issued by the State;
Printer is interesting to look upon, as It
fhows better than words can tell of the
extremity to which the Democratic
party in California has come.
In the list of forty Senators the names
of but five Democrats appear, and one
of these was aided in his successful
fight for office by the Union Labor par
ty. And neither of thÂ°s<? five was elect
ed at the last all getting into
office before the late Republican land
slide sworn the State from end to end.
Tho list of eighty Assemblymen also
Firms only five Bourbonites recorded
among the number. They constitute a
minority hardly large enough to raise a
pood-sized howl against what they may |
choose to call repressive measures when
th? time comes for Uvmxi to ask for
something-. In consequence it is hardly
probable that they will even go to the
tmuble of organizing as a unit of op
position.
The list Â«if Senators and Assembly
men as issued by the State Printer is
as follows:

Apropos of the decisive defeat of the
Democratic party at the last election an
amufilnp note Is sounded by E. N\ Bax
ter of Wawona, Mariposa County. In
a letter to Timothy Spellacy, chairman
of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee, Baxter said:
"There has been bo much talk of the
Republican banner, I would like to
Selby evidently seemed to think he
had talked too much about the affair
on Monday. His attitude was much
milder yesterday.
"I do not wish to discuss this matter
further," he said. "I have said all I
want to say already. Judge Hebbard
wronged me. I thought that the step
I took was the only way to get jus
tice in this country."
Judge Hebbard held court yester
day in the room where he was so
close to death. As he leaned back in
his chair his head at times rested on
the spot through which Selby's bullet
crashed on Monday. Crowds of friend3
visited him to congratulate him on hi3
escape.
Selby is held on $5000 cash bail or
$10,000 bond. Evidently he expects
to be bailed out, for he inquired par
ticularly on this point. Judge Ca
baniss instructed him as to his rights
and informed him that an attorney
would be appointed for him if he
could not hire one. Selby asked if he
could have a copy of the State Peru.l
Code, which indicates that he may at
tempt his own defense.
He asked that the case be continued
to give him time to hire an attorney.
Judge Cabaniss decided to hold it
over till next Thursday, though the
prisoner wanted more time.
"I may not be ready to go on with
the case at that time," he said, "but I
will be ready tohearwhat evidence
the State has against me."
"With downcast head and trembling
limbs, Isaac Selby, the ex-clergyman
who attempted 'to kill Judge James C.
B. Hebbard in his courtroom on Mon
day, faced Judge Cabaniss yesterday
to be arraigned for the crime of as
sault to commit murder. Judge Hsb
bard did not appear in the courtroom,
hut he visited the jail in the afternoon
to take a look at the man who tried
to kill him. No words passed between
the two.
The Astor suit is against the com
pany, the real estate cents, A. Bosch
ke (inventor of the dredge and presi
dent c-f the company) and C. W. Clarke,
who loaned Boschke $5000 and took the
Â£1,000 shares as security. The. money
has not been repaid and Clarke adver
tised the stock for sale yesterday. The
plaintiff, Astor, says that 16.000 of the
hypothecated shares belong to her and
that there is a scheme afoot for Clarke
to get the property at far below its
value.
The other suit is brought against the
same defendants by Charles F. Blan
din, owner of 100 shares, which he val
ues at $5 each. He recites that he has
options to buy 12,765 shares and has
given his note to the company for
$4475 10 for payment of a 35 cents a
share dividend, which. will become due
January 9 next. He also claims to have
an option for tho ' purchase of 51,000
shares more, and if the other stock
holders will join him they will repre
sent 94,341 sharesâ all that are out
standing. Then he says he is willing
to redeem the stock hypothecated to
Clarke if given an opportunity to do
so. He says the dredge will have a ca
pacity of 20,000 cubic yards of dirt a
day and its daily profits will be $500.
Therefore it is too good to lose. Be
sides the injunction and damages he
asks that not more than 5010 shares of
the stock shall be used to liquidate the
Clarke loan.
The advertised sale by Baldwin &
Howell of 51,000 shares of stock in the
Western Dredging Company was pre
vented yesterday by a temporary re
straining order rranted by Judge Hunt
at the i..::tance of a woman. A. L. As
tor, who claims to be the owner of 16,
000 of the shares. An order to show
cause why the injunction should not be
made permanent was made returnable
December 9, when a lively light will
probably be under way for the control
of the corporation. Another 'suit involv
ing the affairs of the same company
was begun for another injunction and
5943,410 damages. The large sum de
manded is based upon the par value
of the stock outstanding and held by
94 stockholders,' but the highest mar
ket value placed by complainant on
th<? shares is half that figure, while the
real assets of the corporation are said
to be worth about $10u,000. This is the
value or' a dredge now in Oakland es
tuary upon which $Sl/.42 57 has already
been expended and which will be ready
for work in six weeks.

TKACK NOTES.
No business of importance was
transacted at the meeting of the stew
ards held last evening.
W. Davis again piloted two winners
yesterday. He finished second on
Kigrette and third with Briers.
Mickey McLaughlin was fln*d $25
by the judges yesterday for rough rid
ing. At the start of the last race on
Monday Mickey, who rode H. L.
Frank, cut across his field, seriously
Interfering with Magrane, the mount
ol Davis.
Starter Dick Dwyer placed Silver
efcin on the schooling list
Davis, who rode Briers, lodged a
claim of foul against Joe Kelly, the
pilot of Major Tenny. It was not al
lowed. In the very next race Military
Man, the mount of Davis, had a close
call from being 6et back for interfer
ing with Gateway. Horses become
very tired racing over a muddy track
and officials naturally use a deal of
discretion in dealing with complaints
of foul riding.
Frank Sullivan Is apparently play
ing in hard luck. It must be remem
bered, though, that he is a very light
rider and not possessed of the required
nmount of strength to show at his best
when riding horses in muddy going.
He will pick up shortly.
James Dyer, who has been train
ing horses In Austria for several sea
eons, was a visitor at the track yes

BIG FIELDS AT OAKLAND
Nelson's career in the ring has been
meteoric. Up to a year ago he was
meeting all comers around Chicago in
six-round bouts. The mere matter of
weight meant nothing to Neleon, who
did not care how big they were, nor
how hard they could hit, so long as -he
'could make a little money foe those to
whose support he haa contributed. He
first attracted the attention of fight
promoters in this city by defeating
Spider Welch at Salt Lake. He was
then matched with Canole, whom he
defeated. He then defeated Eddie
Hanlon here, after which he went to
Butte and vanquished Herrera. He
seems to have no class as a boxer, but
he makes up for this with his ability
as a rugged fighter.
Corbett's indomitable gameness won
for him the sympathy of the spectators.
For three rounds he, staggered about
the ring, hoping against hope that the
tide might be turned in his favor. Nev
er for an instant did Nelson let up on
him, showing no quarter, thinking only
of the fruits of victory that were with
in his grasp.
These last rounds demonstrated that
while Nelson's blows are terribly ef
fective in wearing a man down he did
not have ' the knockout punch This
might be partly due to the fact that
he did not steady himself when he had
Corbett helpless in front of him and
put all his driving power into one blow
but spread it over a number of punches'
The attendance was not up to the ex
pectations of the promoters, the total
gate receipts being $11,743. Of this Nel
son as the â¢ winner takes the Hen's
share, amounting to $5284 35. As the
loser Corbett received $1761 45. The
Hayes Valley Club, which promoted the
affair, received as its share $4697 20. The
fighters received 60 per cent of the gross
receipts and then divided that 75 per
cent to ; the winner and 25 per cent to
the i loser. This division was made at
the suggestion of Corbett, who expect-
There was never an instant when he
was not trying, and Corbett was never
able to make him break ground. The
harder he was hit, the faster he came
back. After the fight discussion was
rife as to the showing Nelson will
make with JBritt when they meet next
month. It is conceded Britt can hit
Nelson, but what effect the Califor
nian's blows will have on his opponent
remains to be seen. In the pas,t Britt
has worn down his men with his left
to the body, but only the actual con
test with Nelson will develop whether
he can find a flaw in the Dane's
armor.
Nelson carried the fight to him from
the outset and was on top of his man
at all times. So much so in fact that
Corbett found it difficult to hit him ef
fectively. Corbett did try one or two
desp"erate swings, but his judgment of
distance was bad and they went wide
of the mark. . Not all of his blows
missed, however, as he hit Nelson on
the jaw and on the body hard enough
to kill an ordinary man. The Dane is
made of stern material and Corbett
might as well have been hammering
away at a hitching post for all the ef
fect his blows seemed to have on Nel
son. As in all his fights, the farther
the Nelson went the stronger he
seemed to become.
ALWAYS FIGHTING.
and the little Denverite found he could
not afford to give his 'hard hitting op
ponent such a chance at his body.
After a few moments Corbett was
afraid to swing, as Nelson beat him to
it each time. > -
BATTLING NELSOX. WHO STOPPED
YOUNG CORBETT IN TENTH
ROUND OK THEIR K1GHT.
The fight proved a surprise in more
ways than one. The bettors made Cor
bett 6 to 10 choice originally and this
price was finally hammered down to 4
to 10. It was expected Corbett would
outbox Nelson, ; but he did not do so
at any stage of the game. Corbett
tried his old tactics, going. in with his
head down and then winging his hands
over his opponent's head. As soon as
he tried this, Nelson peppered his body
Neleon kept after him and pressed
him r.bout the ring, 'having him in a
groggy condition, in wnich he vcould
not defend himself nor hurt Nfelson.
When the eighth round opened thexnen
sparred for a moment for an opening
and then Corbett rushed In with his
head down. As he started to raise his
head Nelson butted him. This pro
duced the severe cut over the eye and
for a time Corbett could hardly see
for the blinding effects of the blood.
Nelson went after him steadily and
kept landing both right and left to
the body and the head. Nelson caught
him one right hook to the jaw which
seemed to make him desperate, and he
swung wildly, only to get three blows
in rapid succession to the head. When
the gong sounded the end of the round
Corbett staggered to his corner. Nelson
did not show the slightest evidence of
fatigue when he went to the center of
the ring i:: the ninth round. Corbett
landed a left to \ the Jaw that made no
impression on Nelson. The latter came
back with a right to the jaw and then
fairly rained blows on Corbett. Toward
the end of the round the latter was
backed up against the ropes and did
not- have sufficient- strength to raise
his gloved hands above his waist The
spectators were already commencing to
murmur "stop the fight."
When the tent'i and what proved to
be the last round opened it was ap
parent Corbett had no chance of re
cuperating. Nelson went at him vicious
ly, trying everything to land a decisive
blow on the jaw. He tried rights and
lefts and had Corbett tottering when
Harry Tuthlll Jumped in the ring and
saved the game Denver boy from any
further unnecessary punishment. Ref
eree Billy Roche said after the fight
that he was prepared to stop it had not
Corbett's seconds acknowledged the de
feat of their man. .
MANY SURPRISES.
NELSON PERSISTENT.
Battling Nelson took a giant stride
up the pugilistic ladder of fame last
night by stopping Young Corbett in ten
rounds In Woodward's Pavilion. From
the third round the little Denverite was
on the down grade from the relentless
body blows showered on him by his
opponent. The latter scented victory
early In the fight and an intense look
blazed In his eves, the only sign of
emotion which showed in his otherwise
expressionless face.
While Corbett looked fit for a severe
struggle when in his street clothes, the
moment he rtripped for the fray the fat
about his body indicated all too plainly
that he had not taken sufficient work
in his training. He lacked condition,
and when opposed to a persistent,
dogged fighter like Nelson this was
fatal. To show how badly Corbett was
beaten up, it was necessary for him to
go to the Emergency Hospital and
have three wounds stitched. One was
in the back of his head, another over
his left eye and the third on his upper
lip.
While Corbett was on the down grade
for a number of rounds, the turning
point in the fight came early in the
seventh round. Corbett had not recov
ered from the terrible , beating he had
received in the previous rounds and re
ceived a crushing right to the jaw.
Practically from that time on he hardly
knew what he was about. His face was
puffed badly and the blood was stream
ing from various wounds and gave him
a gory appearance.

Trahern. Evea G and Major Manslr had to run up hill at the start, being on the far
outride. Honey came strong at the clone. Major Mansir likes a long route.
"Big BilJ" Knapp made a runaway
race of the closing mile and a furlong
selling event with Byronerdale, against
which 6 to 1 was obtainable. Anderson
brought Heather Honey along with a
rush, beating the favorite. G. W. Tra
hern, out three lengths for the place.
Garnet Ferguson's colt, Military Man,
took the mile purse run at odds of
â¬li to 1. He was piloted by Davis and
In a hard drive downed Gateway not
quite a lenpth. The latter woula have
won had Sullivan been strong enough to
do him justice. Mud was supposed to
be the forte of Isl^ana, on the strength
of which she was made favorite. After
a flash of early speed the filly died
away to nothing. Whoa Bill at 20 to 1
was third. Blue Eyes could not walk in
the going.
Later in the betting, when Major
Tenny became the center of attraction.
Briers went back a point and the Ma
jor enjoyed the call at 9 to 5. Joe Kelly
got the latter away well and cutting
out the psce from start to finish led the
10 to 1 chance Play Ball past the Judges
more than a length. Briers ran into
the show.
W, Davis appears to be quite a rider
for annexing the curtain-raiser, for, as
on the preceding day, he took the open
ing sprint with Berendos, second choice
in the betting. Sterling Towers, the
mount of Mickey Mclaughlin, was
made favorite, and while the mare dis
played some early speed she finished far
back at the end. Albemarle developed
a strong fancy for the heavy footing,
though easily beaten by Berendos. Bard j
Burns ran a fair third.
So sure were the smart ones that Sil- j
verskin would mop up that the gray's
price wa"s forced down from evens to
S to 5. This onslaught caused a slump
in Del Carina stock, the fillv's odds
lengthening from 6 to 5 to 8 to 5. Sil
verskin was on his bad behavior at the
post, and when Dick Dwyer finally re
leased the barrier the short-priced one
bolted toward the inner rail and was
practically left. Sam Greenfield on Del
Carina gradually wore down the lead
cf Plan, winning ridden out at the wire
from Cardinal Sarto, a 15 to 1 shot.
Because Davis was carded to ride
Briers the mare was installed favorite
for the mile and fifty yard selling af
fair, with a field of nine starting.
Andrew B. Cook, the "Hindoo of the
bushes," did a turn In the handicap at
Oakland yesterday that failed to get j
him a hand. Five and a half furlongs
ail conceded vias just his distance, and !
the 112 pounds assigned would bother j
him no more ili.xii ten pounds of !
feathers on the expansive back of an
elephant. That was good enough to
cult the most fastidious speculator, so
everybody unloaded on Cook at a
scant quotation. J. T. Sheehan rode
the favorite and got him away second j
from the barrier. He splashed along .
through the rr.uddy going for about j
six times the length of an Oak- j
land ferry-boat with Venator. thÂ»
entry of Dr. Jitnvell, and then followed
an explosion that rocked the buildings
and rattled the crockery in half the
housoÂ§ in Kmeryvilie. Andrew B. Cook
had blown up. Venator, exquisitely
handled by Anderson, kept plodding
along In the oven tenor of his way,
reaching the home goal more than a
length in front of Nigrette. The latter
coupled with Arabo formed the Jen
nings entry. Michaels landed Judge in
third place. ,
But it ehould not be taken from this
that the bush champion was the one
lonely favorite to become frustrated,
lor there were others. Sterling Towers,
Ishlana and G. \V. Trahern lingered
by the wayside to the disgust of their
admirers. The attendance was large
and betting brisk.

3fajor Walter S. Alexander Decline*
to Discuss Question of His
Retirement.
The news of the resignation of Ma
jor Walter S. Alexander, U. S. A..
caused a tremendous sensation in
army circles here yesterday. It was
the principal topic of conversation at
division and department headquarters
at the Presidio and at Fort Mason. No
reason was given for the resiarnatlon.
Major Alexander said that he sent
In his resignation to tho War Depart
ment ten days ago and that he had
just been advised by Captain L. R.
Burgess that his resignation had been
accepted. He said he intended en
gaging In commercial pursuits and
had already received offers from sev
eral prominent firms.. Regarding hiÂ»
reason for leaving the army, he of
fered no explanation, declining posi
tively to discuss the affair.
Lieutenant Creed F. Cox, aid to
General Moore, said that General
Moore knew nothing of the case, aa
the major's resignation had not been
forwarded through the Department ot
California. It had been sent direct
by Major Alexander to headquarter*
at Washington. At the Presidio sev
eral officers said that they had heard
that Major Alexander Intended re
signing, but they had not taken thÂ»
rumors seriously.
Major Alexander was educated la
this city. He received his appoint
ment to West Point from this StatÂ»
and entered the academy July 1, 1875.
He graduated June 11, 1879. Several
years ago he was married to Miss
Fannie Lent. They only lived to
gether a few weeks when his wlfÂ»
left him and the marriage vows wÂ«rÂ»
dissolved. Mrs. Fannie Lent, that
name the court allowed her at her
request, took her own life about a
month ago, aa has been reported la
the dally press.

Martin G. Ritter Meets Violent Denth
at the Pacific Mall
Dock.
Martin G. Ritter, customs inspector,
a veteran of the Civil War, who had
lost a leg In the fight for his country,
was killed yesterday afternoon at the
Pacific Mail dock. Ritter -was caught
between two freight cars just as a
yard engine backed up to the train
to haul it out of the shed. The jar
caused the inspector to fall under the
wheels of the moving train and death
would have been instantaneous had
not the wooden leg of Ritter caught
under the wheels In such a manner as
to throw the man's body away from
the trucks. ;' â¢ v '
The wheels passed over the artlfici'sl
limb, crushing it. to splinters. Ritter
was dragged along the dbek for some
distance, his head striking the plank
ing at every revolution of the car
wheel, in which his clothing had
caught. 1
The train was stopped before It had
gone very far and Ritter, stunned and
bleeding, was extricated from his dan
gerous position. He was removed to
the Harbor Receiving Hospital, where
it was found that his skull was frac
tured and that he had sustained se
vere internal injuries. Everything
possible was done to save his life, but
he died in a short time without having
regained consciousness.
Ritter, who was 60 years of age,
resided with his wife and daughter at
the Hotel Franklin. He has been in
the employ of the Government for
over twenty-five years in this* city,
working at the Mint for twenty-one
years, and four years as an inspector
of customs. The Morgue officials were
notified and, after an investigation,
permitted the body to be removed to
an undertaker's parlor.

LIES, WHICH ARRIVED YESTER
DAY WITH A BIO CATCH.
Jack Cordell was declared a winner
over Eddie Santry, the once great
feather-weight, in the second prelim
inary mill. The decision was a sure
hair-liner and stirred up the ire of the
fans, who were looking for a draw,
which undoubtedly would have been a
better decision. Both men were rather
slow and good, clean blows were lack-
Ing, though a hot mix-up was pulled
off in the eighth round.
The fast pace was started about a
minute before the gong tapped. Both
men forgot all about blocks and ducks
and began to rip in wallop after wallop
to the head and body. . Cordell had a
shade the better of the mlx-up.
Santry showed a little of his ancient
cleverness, but had no punch. He did
not start in till the fourth round, when
ho began to worry Cordell. Jack began
to use his left about the seventh and
had Santry wobbly near the finish.
"Cyclone" Kelly picked up an easy
one when Harry ? Kenny was sent
against him in the first warm-up of the
night. The latter did a sort of triple
flip in the second round when Kelly, of
fered to make a swing. Kenny took to
the carpet, and as he expressed no
willingness by sign or otherwise to get
up the referee proclaimed "Cyclone" a
winner. The gallery gods howled a few
volleys of disapproval, but soon forgot
all about the big dubs in the excitement
that followed.

The 3econd semi-annual meeting of
officers and representatives of develop
ment organizations and Chambers of
Commerce in California will be held in
| Pasadena December 17. This meeting
j will be unique In that it signalizes the
! success of a movement to effect a prac-
I tical plan of co-operation. There are in
California, no less than 146 of these or
ganizations. They expend large sums
in local improvements and in advertis
ing resources and products. All of this
money is raised by public subscription,
and the contributors share results with
the rest of the community in its in
creased prosperity.
The purpose of the semi-annual meet
ings Is to further co-operation. This re
lationship has already been established
in the formation of county promotion
committees throughout the State. And
it is said that California has the most
effective Bystera In this line of any
place In the world.
The first meeting of officers was held
in Sacramento on June 18 last, when a
resolution was adopted providing for
the formation of a. Counties Promotion
Committee by the California Promotion
Committee, to consist of the various
county committees.
In accordance with that resolution
the formation of the counties commit
tee of the different counties has been
generally adopted. Besides members of
the counties committee an invitation
has been extended to members of all
development organizations in tho State
to be present. Members of the State
Publicity Committee and the advisory
committee of the California Promotion
Committee will also attend. The theme
of the meeting will be "California Pub
licity." Addresses will be delivered by
men from all parts of the State promi
nent in development work and general
discussions will take place. Governor
Pardee has been Invited to open the
meeting. Special railroad rates will be
made from all parts of California.
At the Sacramento meeting there
were present delegates who had come a
distance of 600 miles, and It is expected
that the attendance will be greater than
that of the first session.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 29.
A letter has been received from Iso
Abo, superintendent of the athletic do
partmenl of Waseda University of Ja
pan, expressing a desire to arninge an
international baseball match between
Stanford and the Japanese university.
Waseda University won the Intercolle
giate championship of Japan and Is
represented by a strong team.
The Japanese team prefers to have
the game take place in San Francisco.
There is a strong probability that ; the
match will be arranged. In case the
University of California does not care
to enter into the arrangement it Is pos
sible that Stanford will undertake the
matter alone.

"You don't have to know nothing,"
the runner told him. "Being a clerk,
the captain will most likely want you
to keep his books and tally the whales
as the boys herd them alongside.
You'll make $100 a month clear, any
how, and it's more likely to be $200
or $300 a month. You'll see the world
and when you come back you can buy
a hotel of your own."
The green hand is wide awake now,
and if his share of the bone and oil
amounts enough to buy him a suit of
clothes and a ticket to San Luis
Obispo he will leave San Francisco
Eatisfled.
One of the ereen hands told yester
day of the gilded dream which de
luded him into seeking easy money in
the Arctic. He had been clerk of a
hotel at San Luis Oblspo and was on
a visit to San Francisco when he met
the runner who was gathering a crew
for the Baylies.
The whaling steame.* Williarr
Baylies, the last of ;he olubber '.iunc
ers to return to port, arrived yester
day with the results of a auecess*iU>
cruise stowed away in her hold. The
cruise was a success as fa~ as owner?
and those officers whose intor2st In the
cargo is based on a fair percentage
are concerned. For the sreen hands,
*he rajr-tafi: and bobtail of the *ore
oastle, however, the financial sain
will be small. They have put In nine
months of hard work under conditions
so uninviting that only because ..heir
vessel was entirely surrounded oy
deep and unfriendly waters have they
dally answered to their names ant
performed the duties assigned to
them. They have had a long ride,
and when the final settlement is made,
when the charges against them in the
slop-chest ledger have been deducted.
It will be a lucky "green hand" that
get* SI 5 out of the seven whales he
he!ped to chase and capture.
The William Baylies brought home
1 0,000 oounds of bone and 400 bar
rels of oil. She lost only one whale,
which gt>t away by diving under the
ice. She left Unalaska a month ago.
Strong southeasterly gales were en
countered, and November 12. being
f-hort of fuel and nearly out of pro
visions, the ran Into Coos Bay for
enough food and coal to carry her
to this port. The heavy weather
that drove her into Coos Bay camped
on the bar outside of that port, and
for twelve days the whaler was bar
bound. She got away November 24
and fought southeasters all the way to
to Golden Gate.
A three-hone race between Flo Bob.
Bragg and Chub furnished the most
interest, the horses finishing in the or

To pay me somehow for my toil and strife.

That I eternally be kept alive!

A thorough investigation of the subject shows that Americans j
cat 36 per cent less meat per capita than fifty years ago. But we [
cat more w r heat, poultry, eggs and cheese. In 1880 our consumption j
of eggs was 920 dozen for each 100 persons. Now it is 1700 dozen
for each 100. We eat 17 dozen eggs apiece, and the hen has assumed
an important place in economics. In 1850 we consumed 430 bushels
of wheat for each 100 persons. Now the consumption is 623 bushels ;
for the same number. Corn and potatoes show a similar increase, I
while in forty years the consumption of oats as human food has
increased fourfold.
Fruits have increased in consumption many hundreds per "cent
and arc now in some form a part of the diet of all the people. They
are used at all seasons of the year, as canning and drying have made !
them accessible all the year. Though our domestic fruit product has J
been increased and extended into many varieties by the horticulture j
of California, yet we pay an annual banana bill of $8,000,000, and ;
lines of steamers ply between Atlantic ports and the banana fields;
of Central America and the West Indies to carry bananas alone.
Baron von Humboldt first brought the nutritive qualities of the
banana into notice by proving that an acre in that fruit furnishes
more nourishment than an acre in any other crop. 'Â¦.
These changes in diet have proceeded on the line of natural !
selection and arc not the result of any reform movement. People go
more to the field and orchard for food and less to the shambles and
abattoir. The place of meat has been largely taken also by fish. |
When Scth Green began teaching the possibilities of fish culture,
and showed that an acre of water would supply as much food as an
acre of land, fish was a luxury in many parts of the country. Now
it is a cheap and regular market food everywhere. Rivers and lakes I
are regularly restocked and kept in'a productive condition by the!
hatcheries, and new kinds of fish are introduced into. waters where 1 '
they were not indigenous, as the shad and striped bass were brought 1
to California, and the supply is regular arid abundant! Canning has I
also extended the use of fish as it has that of vegetables and fruits. '
All of these articles make up a desirable diet upon which heaith I
and strength may be sustained with the use of less meat. The â¢
products of the dairy, of poultry, of the farm and orchard, are con-
stantly increasing in volume and are capable of indefinite expansion |
to meet the needs of an increasing population. We are adding to the !
list of edible fruits and vegetables, and with the increase in their use !
and decrease in the consumption of meat there is no sign of decrease i
in .the strength and endurance of our people. Every man is as!
capable of doing his share of work as ever, and there, is a prospect '
that the use of meat will continue to decline until it reaches a point I
that represents its proper hygienic proportion in the diet of human j
beings. . . , .
*"T"Â» HE recent great strike in the Eastern meat trade was expected to
1 cause much inconvenience and distress in consequence of a meat
famine. There was a prolonged shortage in the meat supply
and prices went up, but there was no indication of distress or incon
venience. This had something to do with the complete surrender
of the strikers. Their leader, Donnelly, had declared his intention
to cut off the meat diet of the people. But the people went on eating
and thriving and his expected reinforcement and support from a
meat famine smitten public did not appear and he surrendered with
out terms. It was a surprise to him and has caused a study by others
of the meat element in the diet of the people.
Every one has noted the enormous increase in the use of pro
prietary cereal foods. These foods have almost taken the place for
merly held by patent medicines in the advertising columns of the
newspapers. Their production must be strenuously profitable to
justify such expenditures for introduction. Fifty years ago the only
cereal food known, besides the products of wheat and rye flour and
cornmeal, was oatmeal, and that was imported and. was rare and
costly. Now no breakfast table is without some form of mush
or grits. >}^y

Then I happened to glance at her
hand. There were no rings to iden
tify it, but the third finger on her
left was just a little red, as though
there might have been one there not
so long ago. And then â well, I may
be a duffer, but I knew. There's only
Finally I got inside. It was a lit
tle tent all hung with red and there
was just room for you to sit on a
camp stool in front of the fortune
teller. But even then you couldn't
see Madame Zouffle. She was all
wrapped up in one of those fluffy
things like a Moorish woman, and
when she spoke her voice was deep
and masculine. I was sure that part
was affected.
She reached out and took my hand.
"You have quarreled with your lady
love," said she.
"Yes?" said I, vaguely wondering
how she knew.
"You'll have to wait your turn,'-
Grace told me. Then she went to look
for more victims. I found out after
ward that this was what she was sup
posed to do.
You couldn't catch a glimpse of
Madame Zouffle. It was a long time
to wait, too, until all that crowd got
through, and I wandered away twice.
Each time Grace Rawshaw came and
took me back.
You never saw such a jam in all your
life. I'm sure every fellow I knew was
there.
Grace looked at me in an* awfully
funny way. It was stupid of me not
to have found out what parts the girls
were to take. I'm morally certain she
expected me to know;
"Why. Madame Zouffle," she said.
Then she tittered all the way to the
booth.
"You haven't had your fortune told,"
she informed me, "and you really must.
Besides, I'm curious to hear it."
".Who tells them?" L questioned.
Phyllis laughed. I was quite sure
I was going to get into some sort of
trouble. I always do when Phyllis
laughs just that way.
"Thank you, sir," she replied with a.
deep courtesv. "I will avail myself of
your kind permission this evening."
The place looked quite different at
night, with all the lights going. And
really, the booths were very pretty. 1
couldn't see Phyllis anywhere, though.
Then Grace Rawshaw came along and
took me in tow.
high indeed. There was only one thing
I could do. and retain my dignity. I
must get verv angry.
"I'm sure you may if you want to,"
I retorted with affected Indifference.
"Perhaps you can tell me If
I love her.'.'
"Some lovers fear the stile of pride
And turn away in pain,
But more have kissed where white
doves hide, '
. And blessed Forgiveness Lane."
"You must walk gently with your
loveâ ...
Frail blossoms dread your feet,
And blooming branches close above *
Make heaven near and sweet.
It comes within Love's part to excuse
follies as well as faults. "To err is
human," and to forgive is usually good
sense. A woman's heart keeps Its
freshness all her life, if she is able to
maintain her mind in an attitude
which tries to understand the motives
which prompt the mistakes of those
whom she loves.
"Forgiveness Lane is old as youthâ
You cannot miss your way;
'Tis hedged by flowering thorn for
sooth, â¢
Where white doves fearless stray.
this is a sauce piquant which gives
relish to courtship.
The genuine quarrel, however, is a
thing to be regretted, unless it is
plainly a salvation to both parties,
saving them from a marriage which
would end inevitably in divorce. A
reconciliation may appear to be com
plete, but it cannot put matters upon
their original basis. Something is gone,
something indefinable, from the deli
cacy and the pervasiveness of that
emotion which animated the wooing
and /the winning.
A girl cannot afford to quarrel with
the man to whom she has given her
promise, if she can afford to marry
him. The day is coming when Â¦ his
ways are to be her ways, provided they
ars honorable. A womanly woman,*
when she marries, enters upon a life
of sweet service, in Love's name; and
her husband's contentment marks the
horizon of her own.
Love will not survive continual mis
understandings. Love needs to be
wanted; it must know that it is neces
sary. In no less degree does LovÂ«
need to be trusted; the cornerstone of
the perfect edifice it builds is confi
dence.
Most differences between lovers could
easily be explained away If both would
lay aside pride and would stop to real
ize what they are certain to appreciate
later, the importance of the present,
the living moment.
A bride whom I know found among
her husband's possessions what looked
to her like most damaging testimony
against him. From out a 'bunch or
his papers fell two photographs of ac
tresses. On the wrong side of the re
spective cards was written, "From
your friend, Minnie M.," and "Yours
ever, Katharine K." At first she. was
almost prostrated by her jealousy and
fears. But, wisely, she decided to sus
pend judgment until she should con
front her husband with these evidences
of an unregenerate youth, and give him
a chance to defend himself.
When her husband saw the pictures
he laughed, and tore them up, without
showing to her watching eyes a sign or
guilt or confusion. He had bought the
pictures when at college, and in a
streak of boyish folly had written the
signatures on the back of them himself.
In our mountains there is some evidence that Indians had noth
ing to do with some of the fires which left marks thousands of years
ago. There is some evidence in the groves of the Big Trees that
during volcanic eruptions lava streams communicated fire to the ex
isting forests. If this be true, all of the marks of ancient fires should
not be held in evidence against the Indians.
It is hoped that during the coming session of the Waters and
Forests Society the scientific foresters will give us the benefit of
their knowledge, and that Mr. Miller may be present to say some
thing about the primitive conditions which he knew so well. It may
be, too, that the subject of pasturing, under proper restrictions, the
forest reserves, to keep down the dry grass and remove one danger
from fire, will be considered. But, above all, this meeting will put
into shape a State forestry law, for action by the Legislature. Such
a law has been earnestly urged for years, and the lack of it has
added speed to the disappearance of the forest. The Indians may
not have been strictly scientific foresters, but they were not de
stroyers. They needed no legislation on the subject, for they found
the law of the woods ready made by nature. We have to look to the
Legislature, and this time our urgency should not be in vain.
knew the forests when their primitive features were upon them,
before ax and sa\v, mill and fire, had marred them. We would be
glad to hear froni more of -these pioneers. ThÂ»re are yet alive, also,
torest Indian> in our mountains, who can talk, if they will, about
what they and their ancestors did in the forest, and it would be in
teresting to learn from them their estimate of the forest.
Did they hold it in economic regard? Did they appreciate the
necessity of preserving it : Was their semi-annual use of fire for the
purpose primarily of saving the forests from destruction? Or was
such use primarily to facilitate the taking of game, the preservative
effect on the forest being secondary, collateral and not intended? ]t
would be very interesting to know what the Indians thought of the
forest, in fact. Did they conceive of its relation to their welfare, to
their means of existence? The tribes are passing. If we could
know what they knew and what they thought about the forests, it
would throw some light upon the subject as discussed by their civil
ized and more destructive successors.
This is a burning issue, indeed, on the forest reservations. For
merly, no doubt, when the forests were open domain used in com
mon by livestock men for range, destructive fires were caused by the
herders, both by accident and design. The copse was burned to
make open ground for the grass next year: The fires set for that
purpose wandered at will and destroyed everything as they traveled.
There seemed but one way to stop this and that was by denying the
mountain forest to the livestock men entirely. Then the grass grew
unchecked and fires started by lightning or any other cause were
carried by it through the forest. So the old problem is upon us,
though the sheep and cattle are excluded from the forest range.
Mr. Miller furnishes an example of tolerance and the open mind
in discussion; which should characterize the whole debate. Big fires
that destroy may be averted by little fires that conserve. Other
means, equally effective, may be found. If so let them be adopted.
He is a woodcraftsman by long experience in this State and Oregon,
when they were in a state of nature. There are others like him who
r T^HE coming meeting of the Waters and Forests Society inspires
j great interest in the subject of forest preservation, which Pro
fessor Sterling has introduced to the readers of The Call, and
which has been most interestingly discussed in our columns by Joa
quin Miller. His essay opens up the subject in all of its phases and
the livestock men will be interested in his statement of the agency
ui their stock in preserving the forest by being permitted to keep the
grass and underscrub down.
FOREST PRESERVATION.
FAIL to see that there Is anything
I either profitable or poetic in lov
ers' quarrels. A poorer augury

PHYLLIS," I said reprovingly,
"I don't like it."
"Don't like what?" she
questioned in mock surprise.
But I was not foolish
enough to go on and tell her
what I didn't like. She would only
have lauched at me if I had. I'll ad
mit, it's all very nice to see a girl
help with the decorations, and for my
part I like to see them do it. It's
proper that a girl should take an in
terest in the cause of charity; but
when it comes to every fellow about
the Dlace wanting to hold the tacks
in the dark corners, it seems to me
that it's time to call a halt.
"You don't think I'd even let one
df them hold my hand, do you?" asked
Phyllis icily.
"No-â butâ " I stammered.
"Perhaps you mean to insinuate that
I'd hold theirs, then."
Phyllis was holding her nose very
one girl, in the world that has a hand
just like that.
"Can you tell me her name?" I
asked, slowly regaining my wits. â¢
Madame Zouffle consulted the stars
a bit and then the lines of my palms.
"It starts with a â¢ P," she said at
length. "P â ph â It looks like
Phyllis."
"You're right," I told her. "It's
a very serious quarrel? I think a very
great deal of her, you know. Can
you tell me if she's deeply offended?"
"I think she is," said Madame Zouf
fle. "At all events, she ought to be;
you have treated her very badly."
"What have I done?"
Madame Zouffle studied the lines
very carefully.
"You have practically given her to
understand you don't care for her at
all. You have told her you don't care
il she holds the hand of" as many men
as she wants- to. That sounds as
though you were giving her liberty to
flirt with as many men as she
pleased."
"Yes?" I said it with the rising
inflection. I didn't give assent to any
thing. "And is she doing it?"
"She has held the hands of a great
many of the gentlemen present this
evening.""
There was a suspicious little quiver
in Madame Zouffle's voice. It sounded
almost like a suppressed laugh.
I assumed the most dignified air.
"And the men â did they like it?"
I queried.
Madame Zouffle could not tell. The
lines were not sharply enough de
fined.
"They'd better be careful," I said,
fiercely. "I'll jolly well punch their
heads it they don't. Besides, it's the
last chance they'll have."
Now, for a mere outsider and just
a common fortune teller, I must say
that Madame Zouffle took quite a re
markable interest in my affairs.
"Why?" she asked. "Why is it
their last chance?"
"Because I'm going to tell her to
morrow that she must stop," I re
plied, grimly.
There was an odd glitter in Madame
Zouffle's eyes.
"And will she do anything you
say?" she asked. "She must be well ,
trained to obey your 'Lie down, '
Carlo,' every time."
"She'll do it if she loves me," I
said. "By the way, I haven't asked
you; does she love me?"
Either the light was very dim or
there was something wrong with
Madame Zouffle's eyes. The question j
necessitated her bending over and
making a very close scrutiny of my
palm before she was able to answer.
The warm, soft folds of her hair were
directly in front of me. and I kissed
them, ever so slightly. She didn't
feel it.
"I don't know," confessed Phyllis â
I mean Madame Zouffleâ at last. "It
looks partly as though she does and
then again just the least little bit as
though she doesn't. I-^I think she
does â sometimes."
Madame Zouffle was not looking at
me. She was still examining my j
hand ever so carefully. So I ventured
again.
"What is there about me," I asked,
"that she does not like â sometimes?"
"You don't always treat her very
well," said Madame Zouffle. "Your
hand shows that you are very selfish."
"Stingy?"
"No; not that. But you always
think of yourself and your own per
sonal convenience first."
Now, you know iu3t as well as I
do that this was a libel. Ever since
I have know Phyllisâ but what's the
good of arguing about it? Phyllis
knew it, too.
"If Phyllis were here," I remarked,
; "if she could only hear you say that,
you would have an opportunity of
knowing how utterly false it is. It's
true," I went on, magnanimously, "I
may have my faults; but I'm quite
convinced that the dear girl would
not say that was one of them."
Madame Zouffle did not reply. She
seemed to have worse eyesight than
ever.
"What else can you see?' I ques
tioned. "Perhaps you can tell me if
I love her."
"You think you do," answered
Madame Zouffle.
"When I really do not?"
"When you really do not." The
fortune teller was very positive in her
tone.
"Wrong again," I replied. "You're
a. very poor hand at your business. If
you've told the others here this even
ing no more truths than you've told
me I actually think you ought to be
up for obtaining money under false
pretenses.'!
"I can see several other girls here
on your hand," argued the fortune
teller.
I laughed.
"Excuse me, please," I murmured;
"but I do a bit of palmistry myself.
1 Now, right here in your hand" â I
1 turned her palm over â "I can see any
number of heartless flirtations. There
seems to be one in progress now, in
j fact."
| The palmist looked up into my face
and I guess she must have seen that
I knew her. But she wasn't Very cer
tain. I never winked an eyelash.
"Now," I went on, "this dimple
; shows â why, how very odd that you
I should have a dimple just like that.
; But I think that clinches my argu-'
ment, for I know a girl like that, and
she's â "
And then some one boxed my ear.
I looked up and saw that Phyllis' eyes
were twinkling.
"You're such an old stupid, Jack,
dear," she said.

Hall. Miss Blanche is the pupil of

Justly proud of her. I heard the little
fiddler, a nice, broad-browed, unaf
fected lassie of 16, in two numbers, the
Grieg sonata for piano and violin, Op.
8, and the Mozart Concerto in E flat
major. Both were exceptionally, well
played. Miss Coonan has temperament
and plenty of poise, a facile technique
and good tone. She plays with unusual
freedom and aplomb, her intonation is
delightfully true, and altogether she is
one of the most promising, students I
have ever heard. The difficult Mozart
concerto the violinist played with - a

technical surety, and the Grieg with
an equally true feeling for the modern
note. In both she was sympathetically

ARBITRATION* COXFEREXCE
IS FOR WORLD'S PEACE
Dr. Ward did not remember his tes
! tfmony of that occasion and explained I
! that his lapse of memory was reason- j
I able, because five or six lawyers were :
on top of him all the - time. There â¢
were some discrepancies between his |
testimony then and now. He said yes- i
terday that neithfer Mr. Ruef nor the]
Mayor had "vouched" for Louis Levy,
the deputy health officer. He told the
Supervisors that one' or. the other of
them "recommended" him. The doc
tor admitted that Mr. Ruef's recom
mendation ' carried a great deal of j
weight with him, and he took occasion j
to throw several bouquets at Mr. Levy
for his executive and other. abilities. j
As to the change from "sanitary in- i
spectors" to "inspecting physicians," j
the witness that the / new j
name was not original, but it; gave |
the office more dignity and enabled t
th<Â» board to secure men better quali- j
fled for the position. The board did !
not believe that physicians needed to i
l-ass a. civil service examination, and j
that was one of the reasons the com- j
mission was not applied to for a list |
of ellgibles from which to fill the posi- i
tions. "Another reason, and one that!
applied as well to the office of deputy '
health officer, was that the positions j
Avere newly created and unclassified â i
therefore there was no list of eligibles j
relating to them. ' >
Another effort to examine the doc- ;
tor as to his testimony before the Su- J
pervisors was met by a question from j
Mr. Ruef as to whether that, 'invest!- j
Kalion was not a one-sided, prejudiced ;
farce." Judge Sloss would not permit i
the witness to answer. j
/ The trial will be resumed this morn- 1
lur with Dr. Stinson on the stand. â¢'
Mr. Wright asked the doctor if, on
the day of Cameron's dismissal, he
had not complimented him-on his
efficiency and told him that the
change "was the turn of the political
wheel. The doctor denied this and it
brought up the .matter of his testi
mony before the Board of Supervisors
on January 13 in the investigation into
the boards action in making the
changes. /
TOO MANY LAWYERS.
The doctor declared that it was use
less to attempt to get the old em
ployes to do the work they should do;
they were unwilling to change to a
larger service and the majority of the
old board was in sympathy with
them. There were so many clerks, he
said, that they fell over one. another j
in doing the work. The doctor was
disinclined to go into personalities or
details in the question of inefficiency,
but was instructed by the court *~ an
swer Mr. Wright's queries. Then he
declared that James A. Emory, for- j
mer secretary r ' the board, had spent
little time in" his office, but was in the
Police Court helping his political
friends, or before the Supervisors do
ing politics for himself and the board.
He said that Assistant Secretary Cam- j
eron was efficient as to his ability as
a bookkeeper, but inefficient in the j
performance of his work. He would
frequently go downtown when he
should have been at work and was
seen, said the witness, riding around
in a carriage. He also, it was de
clared, spent a portion of his time at
Pinnegan's saloon at Golden _~Gate
avenue and Larkin street, where un
dertakers, who applied to him for
burial permits,, were obliged to spend J
from $2 to $4 over the bar.. . ']
With a deftness becoming his pro
fession. Dr. James W. Ward, president
of the Board of Health, yesterday laid
open the Internal affairs of that body
for the benefit of Judge Sloss and the
lawyers in the case of John E. Quinn
against Auditor Baehr and Treasurer
MacDougald. Quinn, as a taxpayer,
is backed by the Merchants' Associa
tion in an action to enjoin the 4 pay
ment of salaries to the deputy health
officer and Inspecting physicians
Â¦whose offices were created for them
on January 9 last.
Dr. Ward was on the stand nearly
all day and was examined by Attor
neys Wright and Franklin K. . Lane
and cross-examined by Abe Ruef. He
said there was a tight combination
against himself and Dr. Stinson in the
old board and Dr. Stinson later cor
roborated this statement. Dr. Ward
justified the present board in its ac
tion In abolishing several positions
and in creating new places which
were filled with other men. The
changes, he said, had been made in
good faith and in the interests of
economy. In six months a saving to
the city of $5600 had been effected
and in the last budget the Health
Board allowance had been cut down
$10,000. The new system of inspec
tion, he declared, had benefited the
working people in the factories, low
ered the number of epidemic diseases
and reduced the mortality of children
to a rate lower than that of any pre
vious year. On account of this in
spection the bubonic plague had been
obliterated among the whites â he
knew of two cases of the plague hav
ing existed.
WOULD NOT WOBK.
The members of the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday held a conference with the
Police Judges and Chief of Police
Wittman relative to the crusade now
being: wiged against all persons liable
for the payment of license taxes to the
city who have evaded payment in the
past. ;>UvC'- -â¢
The Police Judges were .requested
and agreed to co-operate with ' the
committee in bringing all those who
persist in refusing to pay their license
taxes to Justice. It was decided by
the committee to swear out warrants
for the arrest of all offenders in that
connection, and the Police Judges pro
pose to construe the law in. imposing
sentences exactly as found in the or
dinances Imposing ' the ' various license
taxes.
The Finance Committee began an
investigation Into the bill of F. M.
Yorke & Co. for repairing, bituminous
pavements during September amount
ing to $3727. Inspector Boone cer
tified as to the correctness of the sur
face area with the allowances made
for extra depth. Boone admitted that
his conclusions were from guesswork
In the main and he kept no written
record of his figures. The committee
held that this was irregulnr, but the
York Company claimed that it was
not to blame for any defection , in the
method of measurement. Boone
agreed to keep a daily record of the
work done.
It was stated that the work of re
pairing the streets had ceased owing to
the fact that the- contractors' bills had
been held up. The committee felt
that the work should not be stopped
and promised to take action on the
demand at next Monday's meeting. It
was Intimated that the bill wjll be
passed leaving the August demand,
which was held up,' to be. determined
by the courts. . C- K*.-:''

:"alrest and equarest sale of Its kind

We needed the money, we stated the
case, we cut the price, produced the
poods, and got the coin.
With partiality for none, and equal
justice to all, we sold beautiful Webers
on every hand, and no man or woman
â¢vho bought of us, but grot at least
forty per cent more than his money's
â¢north; and we propose to keep It up
till eleven o'clock to-night; after which

We have also the "S'uyvesant," which

...A Beautiful and Useful Article for the Home...
*' v ' '
We have secured from one of the largest importing crockery houses of the West
an article for this week's premium that we think will prove very popular. This China
Cup and Saucer is just from Germany and the crates have but recently been unpacked.
They represent one of the latest designs in shape and ornamentation, and, while the china
is of sufficient thickness and weight to be durable, yet it is dainty and highly attractive.
The design is in pink and gold and the effect is eminently pleasing. It is a cup
and saucer that would ornament any table in San Francisco. Free to any person

The triduum at SL Peter's Church
in honor ofthe golden Jubilee of tha
definition of the immaculate concep
tion closed last evening with an elo
quent sermon by the Rev. Philip
O'Ryan. Father O'Ryan said that tha
doctrine of the Immaculate concep
tion is much misunderstood outside
the Catholic church. It means that
the blessed virgin, by a special privi
lege and through the foreseen merits
of her divine son. was preserved free
from the stain of original sin. All of
us, he said, when born into this world
are stained with original sin. It I;*
only through the merits of Jesus
Christ applied to us in the sacrament
of baptism that the grace of God ia
infused into our souls.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
While the Butter market continued steady
Â» yesterday, there was less disposition to rush
; prices upward, as four out of five dealers ex
1 pressed the opinion that such a course would
{ produce a reactionary break later on. At tha
: same time, an advance In the near future Is
: generally expected, as already mentioned.
Stocks are steadily getting rmal'er and a sharp
frost would hasten the anticipated advance,
i There are now a few orders on the market for
{ interior and northern points, and it la argued
â¢ that any radical advance now would shut
I them off and immediately check the advance.
j These considerations Impel - the trade to go
j slowly and let well enough alone for the pres
â¢ ent and permit the advance to take placÂ«
I easily and naturally. \
Cheese remains as before quoted, with a
quiet market.
There was no further decline in Eggs, but
tho market was quiet and barely steady.
Receipts were 23.500 lbs Butter, 552 cases
Egga and 2400 lbs Cheese.

THE SAN FRANCISGO CALL; WEDNESDAY, 30, 1904.
Tlio Cotton Market.
The New Tork wires of E. F. Huttoa & Co.
yesterday said:
"The fresh . weakness which the cotton mar
ket developed to-day was a surprise to the
trade. It was apiarently due to the demor
alizing influence of predictions that th* final
pinners' rrport covercng the amount of cottoa
djsifed jn *12 counties, would approximate ten
.-:. twCes. against 7. 007.000 ginned In ttoe
ro.T.e coLr:>s â¢Â¦â¢a the MiaÂ« date :a*=t year. It
:s IUJ evident that holder* of cottcn are
becoming demoralired by the extent of the
present depression, aad the selling movement
w.'.j have to run Its course before cay Im
portant buying movement can be expected, for
as long a* it continues the spinning interests
arid proepoctlve buyers will continue to refrain
from purchasing to any extent. We heve been
turprtsed at tie continued weakness of the
market a_- i have thought the spoi demand
would show up roach stronger and the bulls
develop more backbone than they have shown ,
lately. Br.i that boitol of cotton In the South
would cot be Intimidated fo toon."

it was generally understood that the

It is proposed to build a handsome
clubhouse for the automobillsts at the
end of the automobile course and to
provide club, cuarters for the* owners
of racing stables. The Hawes tract is
located Just west of what is commonly
known as Five Points, and it is planned
to connect the latter by rail with the
main line of the Southern Pacific Com
pany for thepurposeof facilitating the
transportation of stock and other ma
terial. The company's engineers have
been looking over the ground and have
reported favorably on the plan. "Under
the direction of Engineer Marsden
Manson men have also been engaged in
selecting a suitable site for a big reser
voir, for which a supply of water will
be drawn from neighboring springs
and wells which will be sunk on the
ground.
The entire project will be governed by
a company incorporated on the same
plan as that which governed the laying
out of South Park in this city, each
landholder having an interest in the
racecourse and the other speedways
and. enjoying equal privileges In the
fishing preserves and on the lake.
. Ashe admitted yesterday that the
plans for the track are already under
way and include, besides the racetrack
and the two-mile course, a two-mile
track for the use of automobillsts, a
lake for swimming, boating and fishing,
and the construction of cottages for the
use 'of those who desire to make their
homes there during the summer months
or to spend Saturdays and Sundays
there while enjoying the sport that is
expected to be provided. It was also
learned that a proposition has been
submitted to the management of the
Palace Hotel to erect a resort on the
tract convenient to the racing courses
and the lake, where guests of the local
hostelry may visit during their stay In
San Francisco. .
. Plans are taking shape for the con
struction of a mile racetrack with a
two-mile straightaway adjunct course
at Redwood City. It became known
yesterday that the recent bonding of
the Horace Hawes tract of land, con
sisting of 460 acres, by Will L. Ashe in
Redwood City Is the preliminary step
toward creating a training place for the
horses of wealthy men, where the own
ers, of fancy stock can build their own
stables adjacent to the track, in which
they will have a joint Interest.
The location of the Hawes tract is
said to be one of the most desirable for
the purposes for which it is to be used,
and it is purposed to go ahead with
the elaborate plans a3 fast as the sur
veys, which are now being made, are
finished and the necessary grading and
piping of water can be undertaken.

"Cloverdale's loss will be San Fran

The Dersons attended a social party
last Sunday night, and Monday morn
ing was considerably advanced when
they staf ted to walk to their cottage, 27
LaBkle street. The lady had indulged
so freely in dancing that, she was fa
tigued, but her suggestion that an
apartment downtown be engaged was
sidestepped by the gentleman, until she
declared it was absolutely impossible
for her to proceed farther afoot. Then
he grumblingly escorted her to 1231
Market street, a lodging-house, and as
they stood at the head of the stairway
awaiting response to their bell-ringing
he complained of the unnecessary ex
pense to which he was being imt by
her whim. Thus he nagged. until she
picked up a broomstick from a corner
and smote him on the head with it.
When he attempted to grasp the weap
on she eluded him and brought it down
so smartly on his cranium as to knock
him downstairs. The sounds of alterna
tion brought the folk whom the bell
clanging failed to awaken, and both Mr.
and Mrs. Derson were taken to prison.
He was booked for disturbing the peace
and against her was entered the more
serious charge of assault with a deadly
weapon. He furnished $10 bail, but she
remained in durance until she was con
veyed to Police Judge Mogan's pres
ence yesterday morning.
"It's a good thing for you that the
broomstick instead of your husband's
skull was fractured," said his Honor to
the woman, and then he requested the
man to cease blubbering, transform his
bail money into two $5 fines and lead
his wife forth to freedom. Mr. Derson
obeyed with alacrity. After embracing
and kissing Mrs. Derson, who passively
submitted to the endearment, he in
formed the court that it was his pur
pose to transfer his residence to Clover-
produced in evidence she neglected to
wilt, thereby winning Bailiff Hickey's
undisguised admiration and semi-audi
ble opinion that she was "the best man
of the two."
PRESIDENT ROOSEVEX/T
PLEASES OFFICIALS
"The process," continued the Judge,
"should have been issued in the name
of the people and the clerk applied to
for attaching the seal of the court to
the citation. I am satisfied that the
parties are not lawfully brought Into
court, and the motion is granted and
it is ordered that a new citation con
formable to the views of the court be
issued forthwith."
District Attorney Byington took ex
ception to the court's ruling, but the
Judge said he could not entertain it,
as there was no appeal. The court
was without jurisdiction till the cita
tion was issued In the name of the
people under the seal of the co.urt.
Tho new citation will probably be is
sued by the District Attorney to-day.
...
In a decision that occupied two
hours in delivery Judge Lawlor yester
day granted the motion Interposed by
Attorney Cator on behalf of the Elec
tion Commissioners. The motion was to
stop the proceedings against the Com
missioners on the accusation of the
Grand Jury charging them with mis
feasance in office. The ground was the
irregularity in the process of citation,'
which should have been in the name
of the people. The Judge ordered that
a new citation be issued forthwith in
the name of the people, bearing the
seal of the court. The decision on the
motion does not have any reference
to the accusation itself, so that the
advantage gained by the defendants is
only a momentary one.
The District Attorney, in serving the
notice on the defendants, followed the
rule and procedure laid down in sec
tion 760 of the Penal Code, which was
adopted in the case of Burlelgh, re
cently decided by the Supreme Court.
The main point at issue was whether
the prosecution was criminal or civil.
It was argued for the defendants that
it was a criminal presecut'on, but the
District Attorney argucÂ«.<_r t it was
in the nature of a special ~r civil pro
ceeding.
The Judge held that deprivation of
office must be regarded as. a penalty.
There must be two parties to an ac
tion, and in this case the people wer*
the plaintiffs and the Election Board
the defendants. The proceeding must
be regarded as criminal or quasi-crim
inal, and must therefore be in the
name of the people. A mere notice to
the* defendants by the District Attor
ney without the seal of the court and
not in the name of the .people would
be a violation of the constitution. It
was a broad principle of law that the
people ~ must be there on the mandate
of the court. The defendants had no
right of appeal, and there were good
grounds for assuming that the pur
pose of the Legislature was to adopt
this summary method of ousting public
officials who had been derelict in their
duties.
Mrs. Margaret Moore, who had Mrs.
Jane Doe Burns arrested for disturbing
the peace of, their joint residence on
the 800 block of Folsom street, talked
so volubly and with such asperity that
Judg'i Cabaniss apparently opined
there could not be perfect peace in her
vicinage, for he dismissed the case and
chided her.
Mis. Burns is mother of five, twins
in arms and three toddling. The chil
dren accompanied her to court, and be

George Lenszwert, a bartender for
W. Augenbllck at 1860 Polk street, was
fined $30 for selling liquor without li
cense. â¢ and Judge Cabaniss said he
would have made the fine $100 if Augen
blick himself had been convicted.
Whereupon Augenblick said he was
ready and willing to procure a license
to sell liquors, but the Police Commis
sion would not let him have it and he
would like to know the reason why.
To which the Judge retorted that the
proper authority from whom to seek
the desired enlightenment was the Po
lice Commission itself. Then It devel
oped that Mr. Augenbllck *had a license
until the commissioners declined to re
new it.
James Hayes, a burly fellow who vi
ciously beat Andrew Johnson, a crip
ple, was given four months by Judge
Cabaniss.

"I'm going to leave town to-night,"
said James Maguire to Patrolman
Reed (in plain clothes) "and before I
go some guy's head is going to be
knocked and I'll have money."
The confidence was imparted at
Fourth and; Market streets where
James accosted the plain clc-thes man
for alms. He was arrested, of course,
and to Judge Mogan he stated that he
recently came from Fair River, Mass.,
where he was a weaver of cotton, and
desired to return there. The police,
however, are pretty certain that he
neither weaves nor spins, but is one of
the many professional vagabonds who
have decided to winter here, and when
he is sentenced for. vagrancy to-day the
maximum - penalty â which is six
months' imprisonmentâ is likely to be
his. ;.i>?

the theft and offered to return all the
money he had not spent, but the mag

Louis Derson wept as he told of how
his head had been battered with a
broomstick In the hands of his better
half, Margaret, but he protested" that
the tear ducts were not operated by
physical pain. What were his 'cranial
Injuries, he asked, in comparison with
the laceration of soul caused by the re
flection that she who had assailed him
might be imprisoned for committing
assault with a deadly weapon?
"If my poor, dear wife is taken from
me," he sobbed, "the blow will kill both
of us."
Mrs. Derson seemed to be less ap
palled than her spouse by the prospect
of their Â¦ severance. She furtively
watched the effect of his lachrymal
display on the court, and her glances
betrayed neither penitence nor fear.

One grain of the active principle in
Stuart's Dyspesla Tablets will digest
3000 grains of meat, eggs or other
wholesome food, and this claim has
been proven by actual . experiment
which anyone can perform for himself
in i the** following - manner: Cut hard-
boiled eggs into very small pieces, as
it would be if masticated, place " the
egg and two or three of the tablets In
a bottle or jar containing warm water,
heated to 08 degrees (the temperature
of the body), and keep it at this tem-
perature f of three, and one-half hours,
at the end of which time, the egg will
be as completely digested as It would
have been in the healthy stomach of
a hungiy boy.
The point of this experiment is that
what Stuart's Dyspesia Tablets will do
to the â¢ ege" in the bottle it wiil do to
the egg ' or Â¦ meat ' in the stomach, Â¦ and
nothing else will rest and invigorate
the stomach so safely and effectually.
Even a little child can take Stuart's
Tablets with safety, and benefit if its
digestion is weak and the thousands of
cures accomplished by their regular
daily use are easily explained when it
is understood that they are composed
of vegetable essences, aseptic pepsin,
diastase and Golden Seal, which
mingles, with the food and digest it
thoroughly, giving the, overwArked
stomach a chance to recuperate.
Dieting never cures dyspepsia, neith-
er do pills and cathartic medicines,
which', simply irritate and Inflame the
intestines. KSfiSPS
When enough food Is ; eatenÂ» and
promptly digested there win be no con-

There's Only One Way to
Get the Best of Whisky
And that is to let it alone. If you try
any other way it will get the best of
you. If you can't let It alone you need
Dr. McKanna's treatment. Dr. McKan-
na cures the liquor habit by destroying
the desire for liquor and putting the
system in its natural condition, where
liquor is not needed to htlp the machin-
ery of the body to do its work. Dr.
McKanna effects a complete cure in three
days without the use of dangerous hy-
podermics, annoying confinement or bad
after effects. Dr. McKanna's treatment
Is absolutely safe and cannot harm the
most delicate constitution. Why .waste
time and money in drinking whisky
when you can be cured of the liquor
habit in three days with no char.ee of
failure, no risk and no unpleasantness?
; Think it over and call or write Dr. Mc-
' Kanna for full Information. Address 1-1
