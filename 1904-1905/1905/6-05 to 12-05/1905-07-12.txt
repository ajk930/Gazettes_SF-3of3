MOSCOW, July 11.â Major General
Count Shouvaloff, Prefect of Police
here and formerly attached to the Min
istry of the Interior, was assassinated
this morning while receiving petitions.
One of the petitioners drew a revolver
and fired five times at the Prefect, who
fell dead. The assassin was arrested.
The assassin, who was dressed as a
peasant, has not been Identified. He was
recently arrested as a political suspect,
but escaped from the police station before
his examination.
He waited in the anteroom of the pre
fecture until the other petitioners had
been received, and then, entering the au
dience room, he advanced toward Count
Shouvaloff, firing five shots at close
range. Four bullets took effect-
One bullet wounded the Count in the
pericardium; another pierced, his abdo
men; a Uiird struck him In the arm, and
the fourth in the shoulder, while the fifth
bullet of the assassin struck the leg of
an official who was standing near.
Count Shouvaloff constantly risked
death through his custom of freely grant

from all ciapses.
A great crowd gathered in front of the
house of Count Shouvaloff and made a
demonstration to show its indignation
end sorrow at the assassination of the
Prefect, who was very popular.

ST. PETERSBURG, July 11.â The as
sassination of Prefect of Police Count
Ehuvaloff of Moscow to-day Is consM
ered' to have been a purely political
crime, as the Count was not mora than
40 years of age and was regarded as
being one of the best type of Russian
odclals. He came from one of the
most famous families in Russia,
The Count was a son of Count Peter
EhuvaloJt. the statesman who repre
sented Russia at the Berlin conference;
was formerly colonel of the Guard
Regiment known as the St. Petersburg
and was one of Emperor Nicholas' per
sonal friends. As Prefect of Odessa,
when he succeeded General Zelenoi,
who was extremely severe. Count Shu
valoff earned the esteem of all by his
flrm but lenient course, making himself
particularly popular with the students.
The impression exists here that the
Count was killed for preserving order.

NEW YORK, July 11.-As the result of
an article pertaining to the recent visit
to Kentucky of Miss Alice Roosevelt,
Robert W. Criswell, editor and publisher
of the. The New Yorker, a weekly publi
cation in this city, was arrested to-day
on a charge of criminal libel and was
held in $1000 bail by Magistrate McAvoy
in the Tombs court.
The complainant against him Is Repre
sentative Joseph 1* Rhinock, who was
recently elected from the Sixth Congres
sional District or Kentucky. Mr. Rhin
ock, -who Is one of the most popular men
in Kentucky, where he is prominent* in
horse racing circles, has his home in
Covington, of which city he was Mayor
for two terms. Married, with several
children, the eldest a girl of 16, the Rep
resentative felt so keenly : the reflection
cast upon him In the article that \u25a0â¢ he
came to this city and told his story: to
Districts Attorney Jerome, who.. placed
the investigation in the hands of As
sistant District. Attorney Krotzel. - Â«-i
The article of which hercomplains; was
printed in the issue of June 21,: under the
heading: "An Insult to* Miss Roosevelt."
She was named id it; aswas al.Â«'o Rep'
resentatlve Nicholas Loncworth:-'of "Ken
tucky. Both Miss- Roosevelt/ and Mr.
Longworth are now on'the"wayr to the
Philippines with. Secretary Taffs party.
Mr. Rhinock. who la a warm friend of
Mr. Longworth, had his attention drawn
to thd publication by a friend and. when
he reached this city he showed it: to Mr.
Jerome. Attached to the complaint pre
sented to Magistrate McAvoy was the
article, in which it was said Miss Roose
velt had been utilized by Mr. Longworth
to advance his prestige; that she had
been introduced by him to Mr. Rhinock
among others, who was accused of hav
ing been indicted on a charge of snatch
ing $50 from a man.
Mr. Krotzel learned that The New
Yorker is published by the New Yorker
Company, and that it has a capital , of
$100,000. Criswell. as well as . being editor
and publisher, is one of the directors of
the company. j. , ..Â»: '
When Criswell appeared in court, his
lawyer said the defendant did not know
Rhinock, but that he had received his
Information from, a correspondent in Cin
cinnatiâa newspaper man whom he had
known for twenty years. In the letter
containing the information, the corre
spondent said that, on the day before he
had written it, he had seen the Indict
ment against Rhinoctt.
As if to palliate any offense, Criswell,
when paroled, went to his office, where
the paper was being printed, stopped the
presses and Inserted an article apologiz
ing for any error he might have made.
The correspondent who gave the Infor
mation to The New- Yorker is now in
California, according to Rhinock's law
yer. His name is not given.

A detachment of soldiers under com

continued until all hope pf-their capture

raising It to his. shoulder ; when Mac-

struggle ensued. ' \u25a0....'
Mac Arthur wrenched the rifle from the

Fugitive and Clarice
McCnrdy Reach the
Alien City.
Pullman Conductor Tells
of Their Journey
to Portland.
Attorney George D. Collins and his so
called wife. Clarice McCurdy, arrived in
Victoria, British Columbia, yesterday. A
telegram to The Call announced that he
registered himself and companion as
"George D. Collins and Sister, San
Francisco," at the Driard. the fashionable
hotel of Victoria, last night. There the
alleged bigamist, who fled from this city
last Friday night to escape bis pending
trial, is now safe from the power of the
authorities of California.
In the treaty which the Government of
the United States signed with Great
Britain bigamy is not on the list of
crimes for which a fugitive must be ex
tradited.
Chief of Police Dlnan yesterday after
noon received the following telegram
from Victoria in answer to the one he
sent:
VICTORIA. July 11.
Chief of Felice Dlnan, San Francisco:
If Collins comes this war cannot hold him.
See extradition treaty.
J. M. LAXGtEt, Chief of Police.
Collins is Indeed safe for all time, un
less some Governor of a province desires
to give him up, and this Is an extremely
unlikely, occurrance.
One witness has been found by the
police who was on the train in which
Collins and his. wife took passage and ho
remained with , them until they reached
Portland. This man Is James Harries,
Pullman car conductor. According to his
story, Collins and his wife rode with him
to Portland, reaching there at 7:25 o'clock
Sunday morning. The former Inquired
minutely about the trains running from
Portland to Seattle and about the con
nections from Seattle to Victoria.
ES ROUTE FOR CANADA.
Collins was on his way to Canada, and
he - should have reached there, provided
he missed no trains, early Monday morn
ing. This means that ho was perfectly
saf o from possible arrest at least half
a day before : his escape . was discovered
In San â¢ Francisco. While * the exciting
scene was going on In the courtroom last
Monday afternoon, and while every one
was asking the question, "Where la Col
lins?" that individual was probably sit
ting on' the veranda of bis hotel, smok
ing a cigar and smiling as he thought of
the furor which bis escape was creating
in his native city.
Conductor Harries tells > a vivid story
of the trip to Portland with Collins and
his wife. "I did not see them until after
we had \u25a0 passed Sixteenth street. Oak
land, he said. "I was checking up my
cars, beginning at the back of the train,
when Sam "Wright, porter of the Pullman
car Mount Olympus, ; came back to where
I was working and told me that he had
a crank in the drawing-room of his car
and that the man would not get out He
asked :me to , come back and : talk with
him, I told him to let the man alone and
that I would tend to him as soon as I
could get forward.
WANTED ' DRAWING-ROOM. , /"
"1 checked up the cars In " tha rear ; of
the train ; and went to - the Mount Olym
pus. There I found a 'man and a woman,
evidently his wife, occupying the draw
ing-room. -, He had ,no Pullman tickets
and he asked me to! give him accommo
dations 'to? Portland. He seemed over
anxious . to have ; a drawing-room. â¢ but I
told him . that there' were - none left and
that i he would be lucky,. to get a section.

Are All at Sea
GRAND JUR7 IS INVESTIGATING
XV hen George D. Collins stole away
ivlth Clarice MeCurdy, his putative wife,
in the screening darkness of last Fri
day uigrht to escape trial on the charge
Â«jT bigamy with seeming sure convic
tion Ktarinc him in the face, he covered
his tracks with &\\ thccro.Ctj zeal of the
most desperate itnd accomplished crim
inal. His sudden disappearance with
out detection by any one and his ab
sence for xhrcc days from the heart of
\u25a0 Kreat city, whore he Is well known
by thousands, is only eclipsed by the .
way- in which his cunning mind has
â¢â¢nabled .him to succossfuly evade the
thousands of officers throughout the
country who were on the lookout for him.
Mrs. Sarah MeCurdy has shown that
fhe is even more clever than her fon-in
!aw in leaving the place where she is so
batiiy wanted. She left this city some
time after. Saturday noon, no one
knows when, nor for where. No
one saw her leave the house; no one
saw her board either train or steamer.
The Southern Pacific clcrkr; do not re
member having sold a ticket to any
one of her ciescription. nor do the pas
ienzpT agents of the steamship lines
f-f'sn to have booked her for passage on
th<? water. Shu has disappeared, faded
Irom eight as quickly as a desert
mirage. And the police are st'.ll hunt
tlng, clewless.
COLI.IXS' HOME DESERTED.
The home at 111$ Sacramento street
is'deserted now. All of the furniture
is there and much of the clothing of
the former inmates. Collins und his
wife took Only two small handbags.
The seven trunks of Mrs. MeCurdy are
still in the house, tightly locked, but
their owner is gone and with her a
square grip and a few personal articles
of wearing apparel. She must have
planned h*r escape very carefully, for
there is no evidence of a hasty looking
over of things and a quick packing.
The warrant for her arrest is out and
her description has been telegraphed
to every larjre city in the Cnited States.
She has only one day's start of the
police and they are very confident that â¢
she will never reach the border with
out detection.
The trial of Collins was again called
in the Superior Court yesterday. There
was no crowd present, in direct con
trast to the scene of Monday. Judge
1-onnon suggested to District Attorney
Byington that the case be continued
until next Tuesday, but the latter
thought that Friday would be better
and that day was selected.
Immediately after the continuance. At
torney Thomas O'Connor, appointed by
the court to defend Collins, asked that
he be excused from further service.
Judgs Leanon denied the request, stating
that there might be more work for
O'Connor to do. "I lose again,'.' . mur
mured th>e attorney as he took his seat
iipa'n.
â¢i*i Fie" O'Donnell Is now a much
Kusjm man. Early yesterday morning
In? C'-.ind Jury Issued a subpena fcr
liir.v t> nr-pcar before it and testify. Fear
in? T.iDt :>rtssib!e O'Donnell had sought
t-Â» escape^ the Grand Jury sent four offi
tÂ«r.i to help bring him in. A continued
t parch brought no results and finally It
was discontinued. When found he will
be severely questioned as to the Identity
at tho man who ordered the automobiles
by which Collins and his party were able
tv leave San Francisco without attract
ing public attention. The members of the
Grand Jury believe that this man, who
ever he is, knew that- the alleged bigam
ist intended to escape and that he ar
ranged all the details of the plan.
FUGITIVE'S ROAD IS ROUGH.
What Collins will do to earn a living
in Canada Is an interesting question. Un
less Mrs. MeCurdy supplied him with
money, he did not have much with him.
J Even were he admitted in that province,
lie would hardly be allowed to practice
there in face of his record here. As clerk
and adviser for another attorney he could
draw a to^-notch salary. "It will be &
lucky man who employs him," said At
torney O'Connor yesterday to a crowd or
fellow practitioners who were â¢ discussing
the subject in the riall of Justice, "for 1
truly believe that Collins is one of the
ismarteet lawyers in the world to-day." â¢
District Attorney Byington has received
.no word relating to the flight of Collins
after he left Oakland on Friday night.
He waited anxiously all day yesterday
for some telegram which would throw
light on the trail of the man. Thomas
O'Connor is as much In the dark as are
all the others. Xo word has reached him.
Attorney Kington, who acepmpanied Col
lins in the launch and the automobile,
r wears that he has heard nothing fromj
his employer and that he has no idea
where he is at the present time. The
dispatch received by The Call announcing
: Collins' arrival at Victoria was the first
information received here as to the
.whereabouts of the fugitive. There seems
no reason to doubt Kington's story. The
* other clerks in the office, Meyer and
Michaels, both aver that they were, in
. no way connected with the escape .and
that they know nothing of Collins*
whereabouts.

man and the woman to ride in it until we
got to Sacramento. In the meantime they
had promised Conductor Ackerman that
they would purchase a ticket straight
through at Sacramento, but when we
pulled out of that city he was still on
board without a ticket. Conductor Hig
gins was then in 'charge of the train and
1 saw the man hand him two $20 gold
pieces and tell him to get the tickets at
Marysville. I had transferred him by
this time Into a section in the car Kano
rado, which was just ahead.'
"It was not until the next morning
that I knew that the man was Collins.
A passenger came to me and said, 'Do
you know that you have quite a distin
guished crowd aboard?" 'No,' I said,
'who are they?' 'One is George D. Col
lins and the other Governor Pardee, he
said. I did : not | know at . that Jime that
Collins" trial was to begin on Monday and
I was not at all suspicious of his actions.
That night the dining car. conductor
told me that Collins was to go on trial
Monday and then for the 'first time I
realized that he was 'fleeing from justice
as fast as the express could carry him.
The next day we landed at Portland and
that was the last I' saw of Collins.
KEEP OUT OP SlGim
"AH the way up Collins and his wife
kept to themselves. They locked (Tie
drawing-room door from Oakland to Sac
ramento and kept close in their section
the rest of the time. She was evidently
suffering from nervousness and' he bent
over her and fanned her continually. He
was very attentive to her all the time.
They seemed to want to avoid people as
much as possible. They always waited
until the last call before they j went In to
their # meals and 'then they ' came" right
back* to their section. Collins was very
liberal and tipped freely. He bought a
dinner the second day out that cost him
$15 and he gave the waiter $1. He seemed
to have plenty of money.
"As soon as the California line was
crossed, Collins began to grow cheerful.
He laughed and talked with his wife In
a lively manner.' By this time: several
of the people on the train had recog
nized him and one. man rushed up to
him and said, tHello, Collins, how are
you?* They laughed and talked to
gether for a while. . .
"I left the train at Portland early In
the morning and I did not see Collins
and his wife get off. Still I think
from the questions that he asked me
that he was bound for Canada and
wanted to make the quickest time pos
sible. '.~e next, day I started back and
I arrived here to-night. As I stepped
from the train at the Oakland mole
Detective Gibson met me and asked me
ii I was on the train that left Oakland
at 9 o'clock, on. Friday night. It told
him that I was and then went on to tell
him of the whole trip. . Then I came to
my home here at 1241Â»4 Market street."
SAFE IX DOMIXIOX.
If Collins arrived in Portland at 7:30
o'clock Sunday, morning he was a"ble
to catch a train at 8:30 for Seattle. He
would arrive in Seattle on this schedule
some time before . 5 o'clock Sunday
afternoon/ There are fast boats run
ning night and day from Seattle to Vic
toria arid he must have reached the
Canadian shore before daylight Mon
day morning. By 8 o'clock he was prob
ably settled comfortably in his hotel,
and thus half a day before his escape
from San Francisco was discovered was
safe from all pursuit.

Although George D. 'Collins has fled
from. the city to escape trial for bigamy,
he left one example of his shrewdness
as a lawyer. He has an office fitted out
like a palace, full of rich furniture and
stacked with an exhaustive library of
legal 'boks. These are assets of consid
erable value. â¢ â¢
Yesterday morning Hiram Johnson and
Deputy Bneriff Jesse Galland appeared.
at"~the ottice to serve two writs of at
tachment on these personal belongings
of -Collins. To their surprise and dis-.
may, Frank V. Kington, clerk, in; the
office, ' who accompanied his flying em
ployer along the first stage of the lat
ter's journey, told them that the prop
erty in the office was no longer that of
George D. Collins, but that it belonged
to Mrs. Sarah A. McCurdy, for whom
he was acting. To prove his statement,
he produced a bill of sale from Collins to
Mrs. McCurdy, dated July 3. He had an
otherpaper, a letter from Mrs. McCurdy,
dated July 8/ appointing him representa
tive to act for her in the matter.
CHARLOTTA ATTACHES.
The attachments were for a claim of
Collins' wife, Charlotta, for alimony to
the amount of $100, which the court al
lowed . her some weeks ago. The other
writ is a claim for $698 70, held, by A. E.
Lucas, the detective employed by Collins
to shadow Clarice McCurdy and her
mother. Both writs are now subject to
the claim of Mrs. McCurdy to all of the
property. There is also a chattel mort
gage for $750, held by R. McColgan, on
the furniture arid books iv ! the offlces.V
The bill of sale made out to ' Mrs. Mc-
Curdy shows that Collins had planned his
escape for some time;before he" finally
took the step. Collins evidently â¢ had
staked all on the appeal to the;Unlted
States Supreme Court, but, fearing that
the decision would be against him! he
carefully planned his flight. . Mrs. Mc-
Curdy, who owns real estate about Sari
Francisco and is supposed to have had
considerable cash on hand last week,
must have advanced the expenses of Col
lins' sudden flight. Thus everything was
in readiness and as soon as Collins heard
from Judge McKenna that his petition
had been refused he fled.
MYSTERIOUS MESSENGER.
There is an air of mystery attached to
the' delivery of the letter from Mrs. Mc-
Curdy to Kington authorizing him to act
as- her agent. Kington says that; he dia
not know that a bill of sale existed until
this 'letter was given' to him. He -re
ceived it at midnight Monday from the
hands of a friend whose name he stead
ily refuses to divulge. This friend must
have received the letter from -Mrs. Mc-
Curdy, herself, for it bore no postmark,
according to the .statement: of Kington,
and this â¢ friend must have * known - that
Mrs. McCurdy was about . to ' leave. *-. If
this is true, this is the man for whom
the police are searching as" the one 7 who <
may be able to give some clue: as. to the"
whereabouts of the three fugitives " from
justice.
In this letter to Kington Mrs. McCurdy
tells him to sell the furniture and to! for
ward the money to her at an address that
will be sent to him later. Evidently the
mother of the second Mrs. Collins had as
carefully planned her escape as did her
shifty : lon-in-law and : she knew v before
she left just where she was going." King
ton will act according to- the instructions'
in the letter. - v ? ,: ; rV ; . .

offer, of Hhe. Norwegian throne has been
made j-. to '/.' King Edward's , sbn-In-iaw,
Prince Charles of Denmark. Is confirmee.
The."offerUs etlll under consideration, li
is understood that King Edward and the

going on.

/COPENHAGEN, July ; ll.-It As under

will: be -willing, to accept the crown of
Norway if King Christian and the Danish

his acceptance of the , crown, but? King
Cnristian is believed to^ be opposed to
it. >No i decision, :â¢ however, will be I given

SrjTl LKiMKNT TO OE DELAYED.
STOUKHpLM, July lliâ Riksdag senti
ment is. rapidly crystallizing In favor ot
postponing a '\ settlement :of the union
crisis- until the new -Riksdag meets in
January next. A" postponement is de
sired in order that a direct mandate with
reference to the dissolution of the union
may/ be^had. â¢ The present ; Riksdag was
chosen |in 1902, ; on a platform calling for
the maintenance of the union.
It, is more probable, however, that the
postponement is desired because Sweden
wants to gain j time j for the completion
of such military and naval . preparations
as ~ may,* eventually be' necessary to en
force trie, conditions on which she Is will
ing.: to , ; recognize^ Norway's secession,
incidentally, the hanging up of the set
tlement for six months is calculated to
cause serious \u25a0 cml "*rassment to Norway,
because, her status .would meantime be
nondescript; \u25a0 - *. ;
â¢': This anomalous condition of affairs may
be summed : up in \u25a0 the observation that
Sweden seems definitely unwilling to fight
for. the, union, .but. thoroughly determined
to ,go far > for the I imposition of certain
conditions^ on which she will, allow dis

Counts Upon Which French Resident
of Tokio Was Convicted.
TOKIO, July 11.â The judgment render
ed against A. E. Bougouin In the District
Court declares the accused was engaged
In searching out and reporting military
secrets, and cites several counts, which
follow:
Firstâ ln last November he ascertained
the departure of a certain military divi
sion through Strang. his son-in-law, and
sent the Information In a cypher message
to one Kessier, a Frenchman at Shang
hai, who telegraphed it to the Le Petit
Parislen in Paris. In November a certain
military di\-ision effected a landing and
dispatched a body of cavalry, when
Bougouin mailed the facts to the same
newspaper.
Secondâ The departure of a certain mili
tary division northward by rail was
ascertained and reported to the same
newspaper.
Thirdâ When this division reached its
destination in January and another divi
sion moved northward, the facts were re
ported to Captain de Labry In Paris,
through the mail pouch of the French
legation.
Fourth â The composition of various ar
tillery detachments at Port Arthur and
the kinds and number of guns there were
ascertained in Augrust and reported to
L>e Labrj r in the same maftner.
Fifthâ The organization of a new army
division, the recruiting of certain regi
ments at Tokio, the dispatch to the front
and the recruiting of certain regiments
were ascertained in February, which,
with the dispatcH of regiments from
Yokohama and the dispatch from Tokio
of regiments recruited ia Nagoya were
reported to De Labry in the same man
ner. â¢
Sixthâ The formation of certain military
bodies in Hiroshima was reported to De
Labry in the same , manner, while the
presence of a fleet of thirty transports at
a certain point in April was reported to
Kessier in Shanghai and by him cabled
to De Labry in Paris. Additional Infor
mation concerning the cargoes of the
transports was reported by letter.
The judgment recites that Bougouin
sent his interpreter. Maki. to ascertain
the movements of troops and that Maki
confessed his guilt.
The judgment declares that the Infor
mation covered by counts two and three
related to the northward movement of
the Investing army of Port Arthur, after
the capitulation of that fortress and pre
vious to the battle of Mukden. The de
cision declared that, therefore, the Infor
mation constituted an Important military
secret.

CALEXICO, July 11.â The flood situa
tion here is serious, but Imnroving. Both
the New and the Sal ton rivers have
spread in great streams over the valley
equal in size to navigable rivers. The
New River here is about fifteen feet deep
and one-third of a mile wide. The Sal
ton River la narrower but swifter and
deeper. Both together empty great vol
umes Into SaltonSea. There has been
much damage to crops, ditches and other
property. '
The Colorado River is falling half a
foot dally at Luma and is being shut
out from the canal In-takes by the al
ifornla Development Company with two
pile drivers. The New River . has fallen
a foot this side of its source at Volcan
Lake and is falling slowly here. No
public bridges are lef^in the valley and
the water is about one foot below the
Southern Pacific railroad tracks.
The- railroad company Is placing 20,000
sand bags to protect track and is oiling
the water to stop its dashing against the
embankment. Considerable grain has been
destroyed In the fields and some people
have been driven from their homes. The
danger appears past as the water seems
to be receding, though still threatening at
Salton Sink.

SECRET PACT
WITH SULTAN
Germany Said to Have Arr
ranged for Acquisition
of Two Moroccan Ports
DEEP DIPLOMATIC GAME
Coming Conference Designed
Merely to, Tie the Hands
of \u25a0 the Other Powers
PARIS, July 11.â The acceptance by
France of the Invitation to take part In
the international conference on Morocco
was dispatched by special messenger to
the Sultan last night. The messenger Is
expected to arrive at Fez on July 19.
Plans are. being matured whereby simi
lar Instructions wlil be communicated to
the . French and German representatives
in Morocco relative to the Sultan's prep
aration of a programme for the con-,
f erence.
The successful termination of the Fran
co-German negotiations continue to be
widely discussed. The tone lof the press
is generally favorable. The Incident
serves to strengthen Premier Rouvler's
prestige, as public opinion, including that
of Mhe Influential financial element, is
gratified that he succeeded in averting
a grave crisis with Germany without sac
rificing the national dignity. '
Jean Htss, the well-known traveler and
author of an important^ work In Morocco,
who is credited with great personal in
fluence over the Sultan, is authority (for
the statement that Germany has passed
a secret agreement with the. Sultan for
the -'construction of two ports on the
Mediterranean coast, which will directly
menace Gibraltar. '
. The international conference, Hess de
clares,-will by arrangement between the
Sultan and Germany be brief and amount
to nothing more than* a confirmation of
the Sultan's political and commercial in
dependence and the integrity of his em
pire."
As soon as this result is achieved the
Sultan, in the exercise of his independ
ence, will grant to a German company,
subsidized by the German state, a con
cession for the construction of the two
ports in question, and the powers will
then be unable to offer any opposition,
being bound by acquiescence In the de
cisions of the conference.
Hess believes, however, that the fear of
provoking a European war, which inevit
ably would â¢ result in the conquest and
partition of his own empire, may in the
end prevent the Sultan striking this dan
gerous bargain with Germany. .

LOS ANGELES. July 11.â C. ,E. de
Sautelle,' an accountant and. member of
a well-to-do family of St. Louis, and
Mrs. J. C. cYouch, the divorced wife of
a Seattle attorney, went to Santa Ana
and were married. Upon their return
De Sautelle sent his bride to her rooms,
while he went to his office to get some
papers. There detectives were watting
for him and he was taken to jail on. a
charge of forgery. . He had forged a
check for $350 and depositing it with
the Menchants" Trust Company had
drawn various sums from that deposit.
He acknowledged his guilt, but said
nothing about his marriage, and his wife
knew nothing of it until midnight.
To-night the detectives assert that they
have" obtained information to the effect
that De Sautelle Is a bigamist; that he
has one wife in Indiana and another in
Las Vegas, N. M." . His third matrimonial
venture was that at Santa Ana.
. The shock of this announcement has
prostrated his bride. She had ordered
an â¢ $800 trousseau from Chicago and
it remains in the express office j with
charges unpaid. A $500 piano which
her husband .presented to her has had'
only one payment, made upon it, and
there is a two months bill for office and
room rÂ«nt ; whfch he has not paid.'
The furniture which they selected to
furnish a five-room cottage, has been
taken back by. the dealer because, not
a cent was paid upon it. Most serious
to the woman : is the fact that she had
been receiving: aliraonyto.iae amount
of $65 'a month" from her former, hus
band, and' there is danger, that this, will
be stopped because Â£j of her marriage.
De Sautelle positively refuses to ad

itors of -Devlin to have a trust company

regarding the effect of placing? the prop
erties ; In Illinois of Devlin under the

Harry J. Knerr of New York
Mysteriously Disappears
From Occidental Hotel
FEARS FOR HIS SAFETY
Manager Hooper Is at a Loss
for an Explanation of
the Young Man's Absence
Deep mystery surrounds the sudden
and strange disappearance of Harry J.
Knerr, until recently a guest of the
Occidental Hotel. Knerr is about â¢20
years of ag-e. He arrived at the hotel
on June 22. He engaged a good room,
which, according to the management of
the hotel, he occupied only one night
and then dropped out of sight. He reg
istered from New York, but it is un
derstood that his family resides in Jer
sey City Heights. N. J.
The day following his arrival at the
Occidental young Knerr was seen about
the hotel and told several new acquaint
ances that he had been making: a tour
of the city the previous night and had
spent considerable money. He ap
peared to be possessed of plenty or
funds, but his manner suggestod that
he had not had much experience in the
ways of the world. The following day
the chambermaid on the floor on which
Knerr's room is situated reported that
it had not been occupied the previous
night, but no heed was paid to the fact
until the following day. when a similar
report was made by the maid.
Manager Hooper and the chief clerk
instituted an investigation that re
vealed the fact that Knerr had dropped
out of sight the day following his ar
rival at the Occidental. He gave no
one the slightest Intimation that he in
tended to leave the hotel and the con
dition of his apartment plainly sug
gested that he had made no prepara
tions for his departure, for bis trunk,
and valise were partly emptied and his
articles of apparel were scattered about
the room. Just as they had been care
lessly thrown by their owner on the
day he had unpacked them.
"I am at a loss for an explanation ot
Knerr's disappearance." said Manager
Hooper yesterday, "and I have some
fears that he may have met with some
accident or was spirited away. He
owed the hotel only a few dollars and
there was no trouble here that would
prompt him to leave the place without
letting some of the tlerks know of his
intentions." 1 --'\u25a0 â¢â¢ - v
Several of the guests of the Occi
dental Hotel, who have become Inter
ested In the strange case, are inclined
to believe that Knerr Is being; re
strained of his. liberty somewhere, or
possibly may have been shanghaied.
Since his departure a number of let
ters and telegrams address to the miss
ing young man have been received at
the hotel, but owing to the fact that
they cannot be opened no information
as to Knerr*s family connections can
be obtained. ' The appearance of the
young? man and his property found in
the, room indicated that he is a member
of a well-to-do family. The note} peo
ple would like to communicate with the
members of his family, but they do not
know their address. . During a conver
sation with one of the guests of the
hotel Knerr let drop a remark that sug
gested that he has relatives in Jersey
City Heights, whom Manager Hooper is
now. trying to locate.

The latter demand Is probably the most
serious question to be settled, as the com

Williamson Impli
cated by Three
Ovltlvlbt
,* PORTLAND, July ILâ Aside from the
testimony of the three witnesses. Wit
ford J. Crane, George M. Gaylord and
. Christian Feuerhelm, to the effect that
they had met and conversed with Con
gresstnan J. N. Wiiliarcson relative to
filing on timber claims and that the Con
â¢ i gressxnan had written the numbers of
- their claims for them, a letter read by
District Attorney Heney to show the
relations between Dr. Van Gesner and
* Christian Feuerhelm and the knowledge
of the defendant, was the most interest
ing piece of testimony at the trial of
Congressman Williamson to-day.
The letter of Van Gesner to feuerhelm,
which was dated March 12 last, advised
Feuerhelm to go to The Dalles Land
Office and relinquish his timber claim.
*- Van Gesner wrote that he would have to
\u25a0 "throw up" all his timber claims to
avoid getting into troubio. owing to the
. activity of Attorney General Moody.
The witnesses. Crane. Gaylord and
Feuerhelm, testified to Williamson's
\u25a0 knowledge of their purpose of taking up
land for unlawful purposes. They told
cf tonversations in which the Congress
man took part, of meeting in the woods,
of his writing down the numbers of the
pieces of land upon which they were to
file and of his participation In a con
ference in Van Gesner's office, where the
contents of a newspaper article relating
to the land frauds was discussed.
The Government dragged from the un
willing witnesses the admission of their
own guilt In perjuring themselves for
their own exclusive use and benefit and
extracted an admission that there was
an agreement between them and Wil
liamson, Van Gesner and Biggs that they
would receive $500 upon final proof, or
a bonus of $75 for perjuring themselves
a. d violating the land laws of the
cation.
The afternoon session brought out
* nothing original In the case. The six wit
nesses who testified all gave evidence in
the one direction:
â¢ That they had been induced to enter
upon lands by either Gessncr or by some
one representing him; that they had no
intention ol keening. the lands, but In
tended to sell them to the firm of Wll
\ liamson & Gessner for $500, which netted
them a profit In each Instance of about
$75.

HE IS INNOCENT
Denies He Had Any Connec
tion With Murder of Mrs.
Williams and Grandson
STOCKTON, July 11.-Sherlff Norman of
Amadcr Count}' to-day confirmed the
story to the effect that the man known
as Harry Love had confessed the Lancha
Plana murders, and had implicated Clar
ence Murphy. Both are now in jail and
Sheriff Norman declares that he has veri
fied all of the statements made by Love
and has sufficient evidence to hang both
men.
Love's real name Is Samuel Swearn
ingen. He was born and reared in In
dian Territory. He is a" deserter from
the United States army, and took the
name of Harry Love to conceal his iden
tity. The Sheriff will not give out the"
details of the confession, as he does not
deeirc to make public the evidence until
the trial.. A formal charge of murder
hajs not as. yet been placed against the
men.
Murphy still denies all connection with
the murders and declares that Love is
the guilty man. He is the most uncon
cerned man in the Jackson jail, and the
officers say that his self-composure is
marvelous. He Is being severely sweated
and the officers hope that eventually he
wl!l break down and fully confess his
connection with the assassination of Mrs.

MANY AGUES BUMED
Stretch of Land Ten Miles
Long and Fifteen" Wide De
vastated by Fierce Blaze
Special Dispatch . to , The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 11.â Up to this after
noon a stretch of land fifteen miles long
by ten miles wide had been burned; over
by the fire in the mountains back of
Mount Hamilton. It is still burning, but
it Is believed that it has done, its worst.
The changing of the wind from north to
? south last night checked the r flames to
some extent. There is no danger of the
L,\'ik Observatory being damaged, as ' the
buildings on the summit are surrounded
by* a barren space.
Great damage has been done the ranches
that lay in the path of the fire as it raced
toward the summit qf- Mount Hamilton
from the San Antonio Valley. Nearly
everything in its p>th was destroyedâ
ranch houses, outbuildings, stock and
thousands of acres of pasture. The rich
grazing pasture for fifteen miles back of
the Arroya Honda is "a : blackened area.
Not a blade of grass for feed or any
shade for the herds that have roamed
over the section Is left.
The fire is now burning in the vicinity
of the Arroyo Valley. It has not jumped
the creek. Should it cross the creek and
spread toward Mount : Hamilton it would
still have to jump the Santa Ysabel Creek
before it could reach .the observatory
reÂ»Â«ervation, and then it could only de
stroy some brush and the pasturage on
the reservation-
Professor Tucker, who is in charge of
the observatory during the absence of
Professor Campbell, stated this morning
that there was not the slightest fear for
the safety of the observatory, as it would
be practically impossible for the fire with
.the heaviest kind of wind to cross the
barren â¢ space that surrounds the obser
vatory buildings on all sides. From Mount
Hamilton to-day the flames appeared;to
be dying down. .
Amcng the ranches lying In the burned
vdistrict and which have been badly dam
aged are those belonging to L. A. Fowler,
John King. Harriet Fowler. J. H. Strand
burg. A. M. Beach, E. A. Smith. John
Bcitt. Mrs. Villa Clark, E. M. Cook,
Alex Bruce, M. P. Taylor.^W. B. T. Hink
ley, F. S. Wright, C. Gilbert and M. 8.
Rogers. The sheep ranch of H. C. Kltt
man has been devastated and hundreds of
sheep have perished in the flames. The
pasturage, outbuildings and much live
stock have been burned on the cattle
ranches of Charles Bevison. Lee Ogier
and King & Dorgan in the Sycamore
district, between the Alameda Creek and
the Arroyo Bayou.
An organized line of fire fighters it at
work trying to check the flames and with
counter-firing it Is believed that the
flames will soon be controlled. .'ln the
lino of the flr e are the 12.000 acres of
Mary I. Crocker, and beyond that the
land of the Bank of California, the Mor
row ranch of 6500 acres and the small

Two of the Largest
tions; at Exposition Close
TKeir Doors.
| PORTLAND, July 11.â Two of the larg
est attractions on -the Trail at the Lewis
and Clark Centennial Exposition have
ceased operations." 'It is alleged that the
shows have been 'operating .'under heavy
financial . loss, "owing to ; the refusal of
the exposition management to permit the
Trail to open on Sundays, and that owing
to the â¢ stipulated bonus of 25 per cent
of the gross receipts - collected by the
fair management it was impossible to
conduct a profitable. season.
It is said that unless the exposition,
management rescinds its Sunday closing
order other attractions on the amuse
ment street "will shut their, doors. There
is talk of a compromise in the matter and
it 'is said that the first step in this direc
tion was taken to-day when the ex
position management rednced the " even
ing, admission price to 25 cents. .

CONTROLLED BY THOMAS F. RYAN
It has been learned
that Thomas F. Ryan
of New York, who re
cently purchased the
control of the Equit
able Life Assurance
Society from James H.
Hyde, is also in con
trol of the Washing
ton Life Insurance
Company. It further
appears that Ryan se
cured this control
early in the year, at
a time when an In
vestigation of the con
cern revealed gross
mismanagement on the
part of its directors.
Dominates Washing
ton as Well as the
Equitable.
His Vast Power in the
. Financial World
Revealed.; ;;
NEW YORK. July 11.â A sufficient
number of directors to carry on thÂ©
business of the Equitable Life Assur
ance Society were selected at a meet-
Ing of the three trustees of the ma
jority stock. The names will not be
made public until after they have been
presented to the board for formal elec
tion.
That the services of Second VieÂ©
President Gage Tarbell will be re
tained was announced by Chairman
Paul Morton. Morton declined to dis
cuss the disclosures in the Hendrlcks
report. No official copy of the testi
mony has yet reached District Attor
ney Jerome, in spite, as he said, of
efforts on his part to secure a copy.
Chairman Morton in a circular warns
all officers and employes of the society
not to discuss publicly the society's af
fairs.
"In the future, when there is any
thing: to be said. I will say it," is the
concluding: statement of Morton's let
ter.
The Evening: Post to-day says that
Thomas F. Ryan, in addition to his pur
chase of the Hyde stock of the Equit
able Society, also controls, with his as
sociates, another life insurance com
pany. The Evening Post says:
"When the attention of the financial world
was attracted to Thomas F. Ryan, the traction
operator and builder of subways, by his pur
chafe from James li. Hyde of the 502 shares
?. *. to< S * hich controlled the affairs of the
LÂ«ulta.ble Life Assurance Â£Â»>ciety, . a was not
known that Mr. Ryan and h!s associates also
controlled one. other life Insurance company.
Since January 1 of the present year the
aSaira of the Washington Life Insurance Com
pany have been managed entirely in accord
ance with the desires oi Mr. Ryan and others
who were associated with him in the Equitable
purchase. From the time mentioned It has
had as president a former official of the Mu
tual Life Insurance Company, who was riven
"leave of absence" for three months by
President McCurdy of the Mutual when it was
explained where he was to go.
HOW CO.VTUOL WAS GAINED.
In February last general attention was at
tracted to the affairs of the Washington Life
by the report made to District Attorney Je
rome by .State Superintendent of Insurance
Hendricks, who declared \u25a0 that the mismanage
ment of its affairs had been simply. Incompre
fcenslble. One of the first discoveries made by
the Investigators was that the company was
not or.ly involved to the extent that Its sur
plus was wiped out. but Its capital etock was
Impaired. However, under Its charter It was
possible for the capital of the company to be
lnortased to 5500.000 and this was done, the
company thus being given $373,000 worth of
stock to offer for sale.
The control of $123,000 of stock was held by
TTiUlam A. Urewer Jr. and his associates.
Levl P. Morton was a director of the Wash
ington Life. The Increased stock was offered
fcr eale at $200 a share, but no purchaser ap
peared. \u0084 . ;
It ma when things were la this , condition
that Levi P. Morton, one or the oldest direct
ors of the Washington Life, requested an op
tion on the control of the stock (the existing
$125,000) at par. cr $50 & share. ' S
As m. director. Mr. â¢ Morton, president of the
trust company which bears hie name and of
which Thomas P. Rj-an is vice president, knew
exactly what the details were which had been
disclosed by the Insurance Department's ex
amination. With this knowledge he made his
offer during- the month of December and al
most Immediately the offer was accepted, the
resignations of the executive officers of the
company were placed In his hands and later

NEW YORK FINANCIER, WHO NOT ONLY CONTROLS A MAJORITY OF THE
STOCK OF THE EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY, BUT HAS SE
CURED CONTROL OF THE WASHINGTON LIFE AS WELL.
thoee of the Equitable officials were placed In
the liands of Paul Morton. .\u25a0
. On December 30 an offer was made by Mr.
Ryan for the purchase of $375,000 worth of
new stock for $350,250. Of this amount
Thomas F. Ryan bought JIS.ToO, Levl P. Mor
ton ? 1*,_7 50. and Harry Payne Whitney, another
director*; of the same company, $218,750. By
noon on the same day, tne'rale having been
ratified, the money was . deposited with the
company of which Mr. Ryan is vice president.
The usual depositoiy of the Washington tilt
Company has hitherto been the Chatham Na
tional Bank. \u0084 :.': -iSgfeSJt-^
The company had balances In four New York
banks of over a million dollars at the end of
December. 1904, or nearly 17 per cent of all its
assets. Shortly after the - purchase \u25a0 by Mr.
Ryan and his . associates of the new stock the
bulk of this sum was transferred to the Morton
Trust Company.
Having thus secured the control of the com
pany through the new stocÃ, Mr. Ryan'lmme
diately exercised the option of Mr. Morton re
specting the, purchase at par of the Brewer
stock,, which had formerly controlled the-com
pany.
Owing to the connection which the Morton
Trust Company has with the Mutual Life, It
was perhaps not surprising that Mr. Ryan
Fhould have looked In that direction when he
came to choose a president for his. new con
cern. He picked out the then associate actuary
of the Mutual Life, John Tatlock, to whom
President McCurdy promptly . gave a leave of
absence for ninety daya. For vice president he
chose Charles F. Allen, ex-Governor of Porto
Rico. Mr. Allen" was then and is now the vice
president of the Morton Trust Company.

NEWBURGH, N. V., July 11.â Former
Governor Odell to-day said:
. I believe the people expect legislation which
will remedy the existing evils and restore the
confidence of the policy, holders, who have so
much at stake. My observation has led me . to
believe that the connection of the Equitable
Life and other Insurance companies with sub
ridlary corporations, such as trust companies
and banks,. ls dangerous, and that a necessity
exists for a. divorcement' between: those inter
ests. Then the connection of Insurance offi
cers with : other Institutions often leads \u25a0 them,
to disregard the obligations which are incum
bent upon them as officers of; Insurance '\u25a0 com
panies for the purpose of advancing, the inter-
ecu of such other â¢ companies and syndicates
through . which real â¢ estate and other specula
tive EChemes are worked, and I believe : that
legislation should be framed and . enacted to
pret-ent such. acts on the part of insurance of
ficials In th e ; future. \-..^ \u25a0>.<Â«" * -
Further,' It seems to me that the scope of In
vestments should be - regulated and restricted.
I believe further that It would -be a .great
mistake on the part of the Republican organ

refuse such relief as : 6eems to be demanded

CHURCH BILL
IN THE SENATE
Separation Measure, Passed
by Deputies, Goes . to \ the
Upper House in France
v: â â¢â â ; \u25a0\u0084' \u25a0\u25a0/.
PARIS, July. 11â The appointment to
day by the . Senate . of a committee on
separation :is another step - toward the
final adoption of the, bill dividing church
and state, already passed by the Cham
ber of Deputies. , Interest in the question
now centers in the action . to be taken
â¢by the Senate and T fears | are expressed
that the long and fierce fight, which char
acterized the debate in the lower house,
wlll.be renewed. Cs
Neither the adherents nor the opponents
of the bill are entirely satisfied with It
as it stands. Partisans of the concordat
recognize that the \u25a0 measure impoverishes
the church ; and express the Intention of
endeavoring to obtain better terms re
garding the disposal of "church property.
On the other, hand, -advanced Republican
Senators argue that : the measure is too
liberal, especially with reference to *- the
formation of the district bodies, which,
according to the bill,, are henceforth to
control religion. These bodies,' by the
text of the :blll,-; must 'conform to the
tenets of Catholicism ' and ' thus ; the bill
tacitly recognizes the ! Catholic church.
r Should either party succeed in changing
the text Jof the measure.- further debates
will be ; provoked in the Chamber of Dep
uties. The Government, -however, is Tde
termined to have this" measure of i reform
finally adopted : before ; the * dissolution sof -
the Chamber, which will; take place early
In 1906. .therefore ' the f Senate jcommlttee
will. meet during the prellmlnary.vacatlon
which - lasts from July -13 to' October \ 15,

than ' its rival, the Southern Pacific. "4
While the route of the new road r up to

\u25a0 It was finally, decided to^ refer -the en

tered ' Into ; between Harriman and Clark
atthe time the Salt Lake road took over
a portion of the Oregon" Short Line south
of Salt ; Lake City, 1 ; and Harriman became

IN A NEW PLAY
"The Heart. of a Gteisha" to
Be Produced for First
Time at Alcazar Theater
TALE OF MODERN JAPAN
If Production Succeeds in
This City, It Will Soon
Be on Boards in New York
Frederic Belasco is about to stage a
new Japanese play at the Alcazar which,
It is believed, will be one of the greatest
hits of the season. The new production
is entitled "The Heart of a Geisha" and
Is founded on beggar life in the realm of
the Mikado as it exists In the present
day. The play Is laid on entirely new
lines than those which characterize the
usual Japanese productions and was
written by Colgate Baker at the sug
gestion of Mr. Belasco.
Juliet Crosby, the Alcazar favorite, will
play the leading role, representing Ko
hamma San. the Geisha girl whose ro
mantlo love experience and tragic death
will afford Miss Crosby an ample oppor
tunity to display her talents. The story
of the life and death of the Japanese
girl, carries with it all the love, pathos
and romance that could befall a woman
In any walk of life.
The play Is the story of modern Japan.
The author makes It a point to bring
out all the features that attended the re
cent victory of the Mikado over the army
end navy of the Czar. The Btory fully
Illustrates the true beggar of Japan, who
walks the highways and byways and
bege from door to door for the purpose of
raising funds for the relief of the Japan
ese soldiers maimed and crippled In the
reoent war.
The performance will open at the Al
cazar on next Monday night. Mr.
Belasco and other eminent authorities
who have carefully perused the play have
declared it the most wonderful illustra
tion of Japan to-day ever put on any
stage and it Is not unlikely the produc
tion will soon b* placed upon the boards
of New York and European cities.
MAKES A DEMAND FOR THE
LICENSE ON STREET CARS
Tax Collector Scott Wants United Rail
roads to Pay on Elffht Hundred
ot Its Vehicles.
Tax Collector Scott yesterday made
formal demand on the United Rail
roads that It pay license taxes on 800
.street cars, but the officials of the big
corporation are expressing a disinclina
tion to comply.
Heretofore under ex-Tax Collector
Smith's regime the company has paid
license taxes on but 550 cars. When
Scott assumed the office he set a dep
uty to work counting the actual num
ber of street cars used to carry passen
gers. The deputy reported that he had
counted a number slightly in excess of
Â£00, but Scott, after making inquiry,
decided to compel the corporation to
pay on an even number of SOO. In view
of the fact that some of the. cars are
temporarily out of commission during
the time they are being repaired.
The increase of 250 cars will net the
city an additional revenue of {3750
yearly from that source, making
$12,000 in all. as licenses on the cars,
the annual tax being $15 on each car.
The new ordinance requiring the at
tachment of metal tags to vehicles and
wagons to show that the licenses
thereon are paid Is now In effect and
is causing some worry to wagon own
ers who do not understand it. Scott
has had circulars printed explaining
the ordinance for distribution at the
license office.

session of the sacks and their contents,

WAR DECLARED
ON BEEF TRUST
Rival Company in New York
Will Open Its Doors for
Business This Morning
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July ILâ War in earnest
will be declared in this city to-morrow
against the beef trust when the new
plant of the New York Butchers' Dressed
Meat Company at Thirty-ninth street
and Eleventh avenue Is opened. Great
Interest is being taken by local dealers
in the new plant and there is a rush to
withdraw patronage from the wholesale
dealers In the combination and place
their trade with the local company.
On the way to the new abattoir are 900
head of cattle and an equal number of
small stock, which when they arrive to
morrow will be handled as the first busl
nesa of the new house. There are al
ready a few cattle in the pens, but not
sufficient to make a day's supply.
. Hundreds of butchers are in the new
company, which was organized as a pro
test against the beef trust. The build
ing, which represents an outlay of al
most $1,000,000, is " nearly completed and
is elaborately fitted. Its great mass,
rising to a height of nine stories, stands
out in bold relief to persons passing
along the water front. â¢ To this building
will coon be added another of similar
dimensions, Â» which will make t~ie plant
the largest in. the world.
The new enterprise will sell only to
butchers who are members of the com
pany. These include ' most of the large
retailers in the city, who, while unwilling
to force their smaller competitors out of
business, wll sell their meat as cheap as
possible. Should the ' demand . for mem
bership in the new- company continue to
rrow, it will not be long before all the
local butchers will desert the beef trust
and become their own wholesalers.

REBATES REACH
INTO MILLIONS
Charges Made Against the
Harvester Trust by One
of Concern's Stockholders
CHICAGO, July 11.â Another attack
was made this afternoon upon the In
ternational Harvester Company by Rod
ney B. Swift, formerly head of the ex
perimental department of the McCor
mick branch of the harvester company
Swifts' connection with the company
was severed some months ago and suit
was commenced against him by the of
ficials of the company, who alleged that
he had defrauded them in the sale of a
patent. . /% -
In his bill filed this afternobn Swift,
as a stockholder, asks an accounting
from the company and demands that
the court force the company to cease
taking rebates from railroad companies
and also compel, the company to return
to the railroads moneys, said by Swift
to have been illegally exacted in the
past. Swift declares that up to Septem
ber 30, 1902. the McCormick branch of
the harvester company alone, forced thB
railroads to pay it through rebates and
the operation of , the Illinois Northern
road a sum in excess of $3,000,000. Up
to the same date the money received in
rebates by the Piano branch of the
company through the agency of the
Chicago. West Pullman and Southern
Railroad amounted to $500,000.
Since September 30, 1902, it is de
clared that nine other railway'com
panies have been making payments of
rebates to the International Harvester
Company under the; guise of an alleged
division of freight rates with the Illi
nois Northern Company. Swift" asserts
that illegal rebates made to thÂ« Inter
national Company since 1902 amount to
more than $1,000,000.
Swift goes into the details of the or
ganization of v the . International i Har
veÃter Company, declaring that' shortly
after its formation an arrangement was
made between President- Cyrus ; H. Mc-
Cormick, Charles ; Deerlng. George W.
Perkins and William VC. * Lane to the
effect that all of the stock of the Inter
national â¢ - Company ; should ;be -put \in
charge " of ; the first named ' three men
as trustees for; voting purposes until
1912. Swift demands that .the voting
agreement be terminated :by: the , court.:
It is further declared in the bill that
the business of the International Har
vester Company is' of an , extremely
profitable character. -He /asserts^ that
harvesting* machines can I ; be? produced
and delivered by -the company, for} $57.
The company receives;' s9s .l for 1 them
from' agents, ; who! in I turn ; sell ] them for
$125. >'' Swift;- says that? all his demands
for. an: examination^ of. HHei company's
books have been 'refused. : * ;Â»y â¢. -

PRESIDENT
CALLS FOR
AN INQUIRY
B^bukes Secretary of Agri
.' culture Wilson and Orders
a Full Investigation * of
Crop Eeports Scandal
"GO TO THE BOTTOM,''
SAYS'MK. EOOSEVELT
Displeased by Seeming At
tempt to Hush Up the
Holmes Affair and Allow
Culprits to Get Off Lightly
Special Dispatch to Ttan Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, July 1 1.â "Go \u25a0\u25a0- to the
bottom. Find out .: all the (acts â¢ and
uncover all the. culprits $ then let ... the
facts be known and the culprits be
prosecuted." .
These are in effect the instructions
under which a new investigation of
the Bureau, of Statistics, of the Agri
cultural Department, with its. attend
ant scandals over the sale of advance
information as to cotton, corn, .wheat
and tobacco was begun to-day. The in
structions were given by President
Roosevelt. =>
; The man who, is to conduct the in
vestigation is Henry M. Hoyt, Solicitor
General of the United States and acting
Attorney General.
This sudden change^ in policy was.
in -a measure, anticipated by news from
Oyster Bay showing that the President
was dissatisfied with the policy .of
"smoothing", over which had been pur
sued in the. Department of Agriculture
and that he wanted "the. truth to be
known even If it threatened the very
existence of the Department of Agri
culture. . - ' .
WILSON'S ; PECULIAR COURSE.
It is understood the President desires
a complete Overhauling of the' Bureau
of Statistics. Heissnot pleased with
the action of Secretary Wilson in sus
pending Holmes, in the first instance,
"at his own request," and, in the sec
ond instance in : ;, dismissing him from
the department after: getting the opin
ion of District Attorney, Beach that, on
the testimony presented,. a prosecution
would not lie. ; The President . would
have' been much better satisfied if, as
6oon as he became" reasonably con
vinced of Holmes' guilt the Secretary
had promptly had him arrested on any
one of several charges which coul<*
have been maintained under the United
States statutes and bound over to the
Federal Grand Jury.:
The j>atent; facts surrounding the situa
tion are these: 'That Holmes could not
maintain his innocence; that he had been
utilizing crop reports : notoriously and
continuously for more than two years
for personal j gain; that he had been al
tering figures, to suit the of bear-,
ish or bullish operators and. throwing dis
credit not only on the \u25a0 Bureau of Statis
tics, in ,the Department of Agriculture,
but upon. the entire administration. These
facts ; ;i ,were.i sufficient^ to : .convince the
President- that more, extreme^ measures
should have been taken. V , . -
. LOSES PRESIDENT'S CONFJDENCE.
.Added to, this .was Secretary Wilson's
evident; intention, in defiance, of public
feeling throughput the .country to hush
up the scandal ; to , retain ;. John Hyde,
chief statistician, and to | have' no further
investigation of the bureau. : 'j;
-rAlli this shook the confidence of ; the
President in his Secretary of Agriculture.
Impressed J with the t reports that -1 there
was more back of the crop scandal than
appeared on the surface, the -President
decided that the .Department" of Justice
should "go to the .bottom.".
In consequence of this decision? of the
President, . Secretary ' Wilson j transmitted
to the Department of Justice -this- morn
ing what, he said, was every, scrap ot
evidence; in the possession of the Agricul
tural Department.' .."."' i.
The : new system of preparing the
monthly crop reports was put into force
to-day. , Earlyr in the \'. daylff Assistant
Secretary,; Hays, Chief Statistician Hyde
and 'several -experts of the department
were . placed '- in ,a, \u25a0 room . under,'; lock ; : and
key and they were not permitted to come
out until 4 'o'clock in the afternoon. ;. The
telephones ' in <" the room were â¢ disconnect
ed and a "careful scrutiny, was* kept of .the
windows. to avoid the possibility of a leak
through private signals.

OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., July 11.â
Senator Bailey of Texas arrived during

Congress last winter was immediately
a center of interest Although the
call was for 1000 delegates for the

having doubled their delegations.
It is stated by those who have made
a careful canvass that the Hamilton

dorsed, for the reason that it was an
omnibus measure. An effort may be
made to Indorse the Gallinger prohibi

WHAT THE COW IS DOING.
SOME time ago we gave statistics bearing on the poultry busi
ness of this State. The demand requires large importations
from the East; and the domestic supply is not increasing very
rapidly. The products- of the cow and the hen are of great impor
tance'and require more attention from the farmers of California.
The fifteenth annual report of the State Board of Traders just
published, and a copy of it should be in the hands of every farmer
and every business man in the State. This is the only report made
upon the industrial operations of the State and the export of the
products of our rural industries. It shows that fruit is still our
leading rural industry. But the board advises that fruit growing
be no longer made a "specialty in advertising the capacities of Cali
fornia. Our fruit is already so well known: all over the world that
it is wise to direct the attention of intending settlers to diversified
farming, for which the State is so well fitted.
The State Board of Trade has for several years been putting
emphasis upon dairying, arid the result of its encouragement is seen
in the rise of that "industry to second place, fruit still holding the
lead. The dairy products are butter, cheese, milk, cream, veal and
pork as by-products. The aggregate value of these last year was
$20,375,567. The fruits and fruit products of the State are valued
at $25,000,000, and the value of minerals at Â§37*759,040. The ag
gregate values of the three industries \vas, therefore, $83, 134,607.
It is not believed that the value of fruit has reached its maxi
mum, but that it will go on increasing, though destined finally to
be overtaken by the dairy. More than half the pork product of the
State depends upon the cow. The hogs from this source last year
had a market value of $1,801,640, and that of 'veal, was $1,820,^)4.
These two articles of meat food supplied by the dairy had, then, a
total value of $3,622,504. Formerly, as wheat growing declined, Jts
place was taken by fruit. This process seems now to be arrested
and wheat is followed by the dairy, wherever irrigation is prac
ticed. Large as the dairy, output is, the importations seem/ to in
crease. Cheese especially is largely supplied from Eastern States
md foreign countries and a large amount of butter is imported. The
principal export from our dairies is in the form of condensed milk
and cream, which we produced last year to the value of $747,620,
an increase of $100,000 over the previous year.
As long as imports continue; dairying offers art. inviting arid
profitable field to the California farmer. It is a side issue in general
farming. Since the new methods of handling cream were
duced, the industry is much simplified. The hand separator imme
diately puts the cream in readiness for market and the milk goes to
the calves and pigs. The interurban electric roads are to be a great
factor in the dairy business, by furnishing transportation to the
creameries, which are established wherever the supply is in suffi
cient volume.
The honest miner has deserved all the praise given to him as a
factor in the prosperity and a picturesque figure ih the history of
California. Last year he dug up $16,000,000 in gold, but the cow
chewed her cud and switched flies and mothered the herd and out
did the gold miner by $4,000,000. At this rate the. honest milker
will soon chase the honest miner as a figure of speech and a pro
ducer of wealth. All the gold dug in the State could not buy the
total dairy product. ._>\u25a0
The State Board of Trade, fully competent to advise as to the
future of the wealth-producing activities of the State, puts the
cow in focus. This advice may well go to the Eastern settlers who
are flocking in. Not many of them are skilled in fruit growing, and
none have knowledge of the peculiarities of horticulture in Califor
nia, but nearly all of them know the cow and ' are familiar with'
dairying. They find here in alfalfa the best milk food in the , world.
The clemency "of our climate makes ensilage for green fodder in
the winter unnecessary. Even where alfalfa for winter pasture is
impracticable, the alfalfa meal, made by grinding the plant, supplies
an ideal green ration, by adding a little moisture.
In the East the rigors of winter interfere with the milk flow.
Here there is no winter, and the dairy industry is practicable and
easy every day in the year. On the plains where shade is needed,
the fig and English walnut tree may be used, for they grow quickly
and themselves produce income in their fruit and nuts.
If this report of the State Board of Trade could be circulated
in the cow raising districts of the East it would attract dairymen
here, just as the stories of gold formerly brought thousands of men
to hunt for the yellow metal. ,
BEEF TRUST INDICTMENTS.
IN DICTMENTS against seventeen men prominent m the beef
packing industry for violation of the Sherman anti-trust law and
against four officials for illegal rebating arrangements with rail
roads is the result of three months' hard work done; by the Federal
Grand Jury in Chicago. For this faithful public service of patient
and impartial investigation the jury has received high praise'from
the presiding Judge.
The performance is believed to have broken the record for un
selfish serving at jury duty. Not one of the twenty-two members
failed to stay with the investigation to the end of its tedious length
and many of them did so to the neglect of private business which
must have meant serious loss. The Judge restrains his comments
from going further than a commendation of the faithfulness of the
investigation, but he makes the significant remark that if more citi
zens were actuated by the same public spirit there would be'less
need for the enforcement of the laws.
The cases are not to be tried until the fall, and the attorney for
the packers asks for the withholding of judgment until their side of
the question can be properly presented. He claims that the packers
have been held in prejudice by being called a beef trust,; and* con
demned by repeated charges without proofs and by gross falsehood.
If there be anything in this plea for the withholding of '-"adverse
public opinion, it cannot be nearly so forceful as it was before the
findings of the Federal Grand Jury after three months of probing
into charges and the proofs of them.
Aside from these findings of the Federal .Grand -Jury the cir
cumstantial evidence against the meat trade monopolists, has I long
been so strong that there are few suspected public evils which are
in such need of rigid investigation. A money-making game which
has every appearance of cinching the people at both ends of* its
manipulations^ â that charges the consumers more while at the. same
iime beating down the price given the producer, to lessâ calls "for, /an
explanation that is something more than specious and' ex parte; One
of the ugliest revelations made by the investigation is that there
was a conspiracy to destroy large quantities of casings whenever
jt was thought desirable to do so for the purpose of keeping; the
price high. .
The penalty for violation of the Sherman law is $5000 fine, or
pne yearns imprisonment, or both. It is to be remarked that the
fine against a money-making scheme of such magnitude is about aY
inadequate as it would be to fine; ah ordinary citizen a nickel for a
grave offense. It is also explained that corporations cannot' be im
prisoned. It would seem then- that all this hard work of the* jury
may be a farce after all, unless the officials' of a' corporation can
be held responsible and imprisoned.

must feel a deep regret that they made their ', applications for ."yiridicatipn" to

CHARMING MAYLITA PEASE.
Ceremony Performed
by Dr. Clampett
of Trinity.
Residence Is Gayly
Garlanded for
Nuptials.
SALLY SHARP
Society needs a little jolt now and then
to keep it going during these summer
days.
It received a good one a few weeks ago
when Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Pease an
nounced the engagement of their^ daugh
ter. Maylita, to Arthur B. Watson- for
the attachment had been unsuspected by
the Wise Ones as more than platonic
Then came the second shockâ the mar
riageâwhich the young people had hoped
to keep a deep, dark secret until the
vows Ehould have beÂ«n exchanged. But
aias! aj3d alack! for the well-laid plans
of men and maidsâ the secret percolated
into the world without.
l.asi night the charming maid became
the bride of the interesting young club
man, the very smallest number of friends
witnessing the ceremonyâ twenty-eight,
to be exact.
The service was read at the Pease home
at 2600 Pacific avenue by the Rev. Dr.
Clampett of Trinity Church and was fol
lowed by a receptio* and a smart little
supper.
Tiie bride was very fetching in a beau
tiful gown of white chiffon and rose point
over white satin, while her attendant.
Miss Edna Middleton, wore a pink chif
fon frock, fluffily fashionable.
The groom was attended by his brother,
Douglas Sloane Watson. ; V
TDe wedding was the culmination of a
friendship which began in childhood.
The bride, though attending the As
semblies and the Greenway dances, as
well as most of the lesser smart func
tions last winter, was never formally
presented to societyâ a fact, however,
that never militated against her rare pop
ularity. Her charm of manner, her in
telligence and her personality Miss Pease
inherits from her mother, who, as the
beautiful daughter of Commodore Rich
ard Ogden. was a famous belleâand not
so very long ago, either.
The PtajÃe home, which lends itself ad
mirably to decoration, was gay with
blossoms and green things from the for
est; and the main hall, wherein the wed
ding ceremony took place, was a bower
of pink roses and palms.
To-day. Mr. Watson and his bride will
leave for the East, reaching New York in
time to take passage on the Clmric
saiiing next Tuesday.
The Watson automobile has preceded
the pair to Gotham, to be shipped to Uv
Â«rpool with the travelers.
Arriving, they will tour the British
Islos in leisurely fashion, and then cross
ovi?r to the Continent, allowing them
selves six months for their wanderings.
As both Mr. Watson and his bride are
possessed of eyes tliat see, and a ca-
pacity fcr appreciation, they .will enjoy
ihoir meanderings as only such travelers
can.

Dear Sir: In pursuance of- the inclosed res

inst.. we take the liberty, of < addressing- s you
on | bshalf . of the chamber â¢ for \u25a0 the I purpose *ol
drawing Â» your attention â¢to the grave , dangers
thet now threaten our foreign \u25a0- trade-. " -
Since ' the enactment \u25a0 of . the McKlnley and :
EHneley tariff laws the nations of Continental
Europe, France. : Germany, Austria,": : Russia.
Italy. Switzerland,, Spain and â¢ Portugal,",-:fol
lowing the example ! of the United : States, have
adopted, ipr \u25a0 are about ?to adopt, high \u25a0 protec
tive tariff duties â¢ on* Imports > into their "re -
spective countries, which have the effect, or
when adopted will have the effect/; of very se
riously curtailing-, if \u25a0 not in : some instances
entirely cutting off our exports to Â» thesÂ« ' Eu
ropean countries, some - of ', which have \u25a0\u25a0 In the
past. been amone our, best customers.
a The tariff systems adopted by, most of these
nations of Europe include a maximum or gin
eral' traiff. \u25a0. and .a i minimum \u25a0or ; - conventional
tariff under which : they > reaace â¢" the ' rates ; at
dv ty on many articles ; by separate \u25a0 treaties or
conventions with such' nations as offer tariff
concessions In exchange; tire \u25a0 difference In the
two rates of ; duty ; of \u25a0 the â¢ maximum : and mini
mum tariff ranging in the case of some na
tions from 15 to 75 per cent and, more.'
â¢ When these new, tariff systems \ are ' -in \u25a0 full
force the eff*ct : upon .the- export? trade 'of the
United States will be disastrous as not' only
shall we be subjected to the high and in many
cases . nrohibittve rates of duty of the r maxi
ir.am or general' tariffs; but, shall "also find the
reciprocal ' reductions .* m&tls \u25a0\u25a0 by * European i na- \u25a0
Uons among. each other under- their minimum
or conventional : tariffs handicapping our ex
poU'. trade* with ''Still greater disadvantage. \u25a0* :
\u25a0 During the fiscal year,' 1904, our total exports
to s Europe â¢ exceeded thÂ» â¢ sum â¢; of . one ' billion
fifty -seven million ' dollars. .- mor* \u25a0 than, two
. thirds of our total exports. ' Of ; these exports
the United Kingdom took- more than half, 'or
nearly $538,000,000â Germany, our : next larg
est customer, took $215, 000, 000, \~ or - more than
one-llfth. then com?s France â¢ with : $83.000.0Gn;
Italy with $35.000,000 and" the other countrlei-
with. lesser amounts.

CITY WILL HAVE

Friction Over Teaming Con

GANG TO BE LAID OFF
(Jljisli Between Supervisors
and Works Board Is Far
From Amicable Settlement
As ' was predicted \u25a0in last Friday's
Call, the sweeping" /of/- the' public streets
came to a sudden \u25a0 end last evening as
the " result ; of :; the V dispute ; between -the
Board of : Supervisors "and the Board of
Worka^-over 'the \u25a0\u25a0 teaming contract
awarded ;by .the- former body to A. B.
Clute at $4 68; for each team. The city
will ./therefore ,' have - filthy .- streets as
the ; consequence, 7 of : municipal friction
until/such; time as ".the/matter is ,reme
died by an amicable settlement.
- Street Sweeping Inspector Copus' filed
,a report with ; the : \Vorks Board /to the
effect that Clute' s teams were, unable to
handle I the ' carting Jaway of the' street
sweepings, "owing. J to' their, small' ca
pacity, '..,; '.and.'" there / had .accumulated
refuse ; which it .would take ] him i four
days ?, to . remove. Cbpus . in/, his report
stated : that the' sweeping in the whole
sale districts had been neglected In or
der to get the dirt off Kearn'y and Marf.
ket streets -and nevertheless some;;dirt
would : be 'left on/the latter thorough
fare over night. Copus also produced
figures to ; show that it would .take one
of Clute's teams" two days to remove the
same amountofdlrt/taken away in one
under Uhe ; old- system, which, /with the
cost of two helpers at ' $3 , per day, made
the actual cost of the team: $14 36." Un
i der/the old 11 t system, 'Copus said, ; the
team cost $6 and one helper $2 50,
which leaves a balance of $5 86 In favor
â¢ of the old. system..
WILIV LAY OFF GANG.
Commissioners Eagan and Maestretti
decided that ft would be necessary to
layioff the street sweeping gang to-day
in Order that the dirt could be re-moved
from'the A letter was at once
drafted for ; transmission to, the Board
of Supervisors, with a request that pro
vision >be taken at -once -to insure: the
sweeping of streets, which was blocked
under the. new arrangement. The'let
ter, V which will be/considered . by the
Street Committee to-day, follows:
To the Board of Supervisors: The contract
that you 'have entered Into with | Mr. Clute for
the purpose of furnishing the Board of Public
Works with wagons for , doing ] the ! work neces

reason Is that the wagons furnished by r Mr.
Clute have a capacity of 1% yards, while, the
wagons that were formerly employed, have a
capacity of 3% yards." You can readily see how
this board is hampered by such conditions that
you have forced upon us. ....... \u0084..,
In addition to that, our street cleaning. force
Is diminished to th*. extent necessary to assist
in loading thett: wagons on account of the inex
perienced men employed by Mr. Clute, who are
unacquainted with the streets and unable to
do intelligently, the work that has been done
by the union men employed formerly, by the
board. .-; : i \u25a0â¢'/;.\u25a0 *.;.-*v: -','\u25a0â¢..\u25a0*."_!\u25a0' .'\u25a0 '\u25a0". - -

RENEW FIGHT
OVER FORTUNE
Contestants of the Bertha
Dolbeer Ml Take Their
Claims i to Court
ARGUMENTS ARE HEARD
Numerous Rulings Are Made
on Technical Questions
by Chief Justice Beatty
: The legal i, battle 22 f or the \ $1,000,000 for
tune left by Bertha Dolbeerwas resumed
before Chief - Justice Beatty of the ; Su
preme Court yesterday. : The opposing at
torneys - encaged In ft fierce oral \u25a0 conflict
over' each i point: that arose. Some prog
ress was made, but it became clearly ap
parent that the proceeding will be greatly
protracted. The question before the Su
preme Court .Ls .whether the- exceptions
taken *by the contestants of the will
should be allowed. BtH
Miss Warren, the legatee, was declared
by the Superior Court to be entitled to
the bulk of the. estate left by her former
employer. . : During ; the course of the trial,
the .attorneys for, Adolph Schander, the
contestant, took ; numerous exceptions to
Judge Coffey'a rulings. In preparing, the
case 3 for appeal !to the Supreme Court
it was ne<vs.'Â£.ry, of course, to get a set
tlement of the bill of exceptions." Albert
Johnson, for the contestants, presented
his 'but they were not al
lowed.. He appealed then to the) Su
preme Court \u25a0to compel Judge Coffey to
allow the exceptions. â¢
The State's highest tribunal decided not
to hear, the arguments as a" body, but to
delegate the task to a referee. The Chief
Justice was selected for the duty.. Albert
Johnson appeared for the contestants
and Garret McEnerney for Miss War
ren. 'Every y time, one advanced a sug
gestion the other objected.. James Rob
inson/, L. W. Lovey and ; Albert Johnson
were ' examined and several ; rulings wero
made in respect to the allowance of cer
tain exceptions, both sides tasting suc
cess and defeat. There was no review of
the history of the case, the struggle be
ing, almost purely technical In. its nature."
, After the question . in regard to excep
tions is settled, the Supreme . Court in
bank â¢will consider the" main feature of
the case. Unless strongly prejudicial er
rors can be. shown. .the Justices will not
grant a retrial.

SEATTLK, July 11. â Jimmie Whalen
pitched a swell game to-day, and with
proper support he would have scored
a shut-out, with the ecote 2 to 0 in
favor of San Francisco. In the sixth
Wheeler booted Charley * Hall's
grounder and Irwln made a bad throw
trying to catch Hall at second. Walters I
sacrificed. Then Whalen hit Kane in j
the slats, and the bases were full and
none out Blankenshlp tried hard to
Bend them all home, but popped up a
foul to Wilson. Hart, the new man,
chopped one In front of the plate and
beat It out.. Hell scoring.
Frary drove the first ball pitched to
center and two more runs came gal
loping home. Houtz and McHale could
not keep it up, however, and Jimmy
pulled out of a tight hoi* with the
score 3 to 2 In favor of Seattle.
In the ninth Waldron drew his sec
ond pass and was moved down to sec
ond. Two were out and two strikes
were called on HiJdebrand, when he
soaked the ball safely to center and
the tleing run carce home.. Irwln
opened the tenth with a hit. a sacri
fice put him on second, and Parke Wil
son's fine single sent the winning run
horre. Seattle could not get a man
to first In the tenth. Hall's wiMness
cost him the game. Score:

Jimmy's Triple in KlgUth Takes Vlc-
Tory From Ansel*.
If Jimmy Byrnes had not dispatched a
three-cushion sizzler over Hank Spies'
bead in the seventh epasm at Oakland
yesterday afternoon, the Angels would
have won, for they were leading nicely
and everything looked lovely; but- that
one wallop transformed victory into de
feat and defeat Into victory.
Dunleavy had opened up the inning by
beating a hit to Brashear and Brash
booted the next ball sent along the line
by Kruger. Mr. Wright did not like the
looks of Dr. Moskiman at the bat and
gave him a .pass. Bill Devereaux had
nothing but a high fly, but after Wright
had thrown two strikes at Byrnes, Jimmy
swung on the next one and while Heine
Bplcs was hotfooting all over the right
garden, the whole bunch tore home and
Byrnes pulled up at third.
The Angels made their start and also
their finish In the fourth, when Smith
hit o2C a hit and -Dillon put him down
with a sacrifice. Kitty Brashear respond
ed with his second clout to right, scoring
Smith. Robs also singled and It began
to look bad for Oakland, when Spies hit
Into a double play and it was good night.
The Commuters pulled off fou/ fast
doubles that helped some, getting out of
a bole each time. In the very first Inning
1 Graham hit Bernard in the slats and
Flood beat a bunt. Smith fanned ' and
Bernard was caught a block trying to get
away with a steal of third."- This ' lucky
play probably saved the game right there
for the Commuters.
Wright was unfortunate to lose a game
that seemed In.- In only two innings did
the Commuters tap him safely and most
of the Dingles were lucky ones. Graham
eeemed erratic, but always managed to
set Into the game and. pitch himself out
of a bad bole at the right time. He got
faultless support, which contributed much
to bis success. The score:

TACOMA, July 11.â "Slats" Davis
cut down the time record in Tacoma
to 1 hour and 14 minutes. The grame
was fast and was characterized by some
sensational work by Atz and Schlafly.
Lynch , made a wonderful catch up
against the fence, but the other mem
bers of the home team appeared to be
In the dumps because of the change
in the time schedule. Corbett's sup
port was faultless and he pitched a
nice game. He was hit harder than
Emerson, but was. more steady. The
Tigers prevented a shut-out by a double
by Lynch and Casey's single.; Atz's
single and Van Buren's hit by pitcher
started the scoring for Portland. Catea
forced Van Buren.. Graham threw wHd
trying to catch Cates stealing, and
Atz scored. Householder's hit brought
.Cates around. In the ninth, hits by
Van Buren, CatÂ«is, McLean and ; Runkle,
with Schlafly hit by pitcher, gave the
Webfooters another pair. Paul, a new
recruit found by McCreedie In Seattle,
played in the left garden. Score: V

HANCOCK MAKES
DANGEROUS RUN
Daring Motorist Completes
Trip to Yosemte With
out a Single Breakdown
EOADS IN POOK SHAPE
Automobilists Are Advised
Not to Attempt Journey,
as It Is Very Dangerous
Robert J. Hancock, the well known
sportsman, returned on Sunday night
from t the -Yosemite Valley in his thirty
two horse power automobile. Mr. Han
cock and his party of three friends made
the trip without the slightest accident,
but , the roads proved to ' be In a very bad
condition .'and- much trouble was expe
rienced in passing the stages on the nar
row mountain roads. Mr. Hancock con
gratulates himself on getting, back safely
and advises all automobilists to steer
clear of the! Yosemite. Valley. :
Mr.'Hancock went:into the Valley by
the Big; Oak Flat. road, a highway that
has* not! been used much In recent years.
He heard it was passable In an auto and
took; a chance. But he soon found the
road - to ibe anything but . suitable for
motor cars, as â¢ the . grade was from 15
to 20 per, cent rand rocks} and other ob
stacles were In the way from the start.
âVI would certainly advise' all' automo
bilists. to refrain from attempting to mo
tor .- to the = Valley," said Mr. Hancock
last night.' ."The -roads are in no way
fit â for a motor car, being hilly and full
of rocks. Then we .met with much trou
ble In - avoiding â¢ the stages. The horses
were ' all \u25a0 afraid of our; machine and on
several occasions- we came very near
meeting with serious accidents while try
ing to pass on the narrow roads.' .. â¢
"We went to the Valley from this city
in,three.days and came out^by .the new
road in four days, stopping over at sev
eral places. ' We covered 535 miles in all
and ' never met , with the slightest acci
dent. : We went into the Valley from
Chinese Camp in ten hours and climbed
the celebrated Priest, hill In the record
time of; forty-five \ minutes.
"We were compelled to run on schedule
both coming and going in order to avoid
meeting; the stages on the narrow roads.
Sometimes the drivers . did not get the
time : right and' this caused much trouble
for all parties and -must have .been
through mistakes made by the dispatch
ers. .
"At one point we, lost our way and
went fifteen miles along. the wrong road.
This proved a lucky " thing, for had we
gotten on the right trail, we would have
encountered a band of 200 steers and a
serious * accident > would surely have re
sulted. Had I known what hardship it
meant, I would never have made the trip
and I think it my duty to warn other
motorists Ito take my. advice and stay
away from the Yosemite."

the following month.
Just what will become of the proposi
tion remains to be seen. Nelson is so
anxious to; fight Britt that he does not
want to consider any other offer. Ho
came. all the way out here for the pur
pose of meeting the plumber boy, and
if there is any possible chance to make
the match. Nelson wants to sea it. Ha
feels he has more of ., a license than any
other man in the ring to meet Britt and
it will certainly, not be his fault If tha
fight does not come off. â¢ .
Buddy. Ryan is fast rounding into shape
for his coming mill with George Peter
son at Colma a week from to-night. He
is a stocky lad who likes to work and
revels in rough going. He figures on fight
ing Peterson at his own game and saya
he wi!l rush the going from the start.
He hopes to win by ; a' knockout withia
fifteen' rounds. ' "*;\
. Kid Sullivan will , not, have to, work
overtime to do 133 pounds. Yesterday tha
little fellow weighed 136 pounds after ha
had worked a solid hour in the gymnasi
um and he seemed well pleased he waÂ»
no lighter. Sullivan will aim to stay
around his present weight until about
forty-eight hours before he enters % the
ring with Jimmy Britt, and he will then
start to "dry out" a bit and at weigh
ing In time he will hop on the scales and
be right at weight. Sullivan' could work
himself to weight without "drying, but ho
knows that a boxer always works better
In the ring when his stomach is in a dry
state, and it is for this reason that ho
will abstain from all liquids two days
prior to the fight.

Compressed Air Engines Are
Instilled and Keepers
Arc Selected.
SITUATION IS EXPOSED
Men in Charge of Beacon
Hay Be Isolated for
3lany Days.
LIGHT WILL SHINE FAR
Tlv new lighthouse on Mile'Uock.
OÂ«*siinÂ«-d to be fatuous as one of the
mest original and difficult undertakings
of the liSnd on the Pacific Coast, is
making rapid strides toward comple
tion and should weather conditions
prove favorable a couple of more
months will witness Its ruby red light
fhinins over a large circumference or.
In case of fog. Its sirens will be heard
tar beyond the range of Its light.
The Hornby-Akroyd compressed air
engines were hoisted to their positions
>es>terday and will soon be in place
The structural workmen are engaged
upon the lantern which is to crown the
slender pile and then the finishing of
the interior will proceed rapidly. All
of the necessary equipment is ready
for Installation. The three keepers
who are to manage the light have been
selected nr.d are prepared to take up
thPlr responsible duties at a moment's
notice.
The plans of the new lighthouse
were originated by Colonel Thomas H.
Handbury. chief of the Twelfth Light
house District, and comprise a cement,
>t*el-covere<! foundation, elliptical -n
form, thirty-five feet ami six inches
long by twenty-one feet in width. Its
height is thirty-four feet and It will
contain a tank for fresh water, stair
ways and entrance. Above Is the su
perstructure of steel, consisting of four
stories, the first, to contain the machin
ery, thirty-two feet and six inches
by eighteen feet in dimensions; the
second, to be circular, eighteen feet
in diameter, to contain the kitchen,
third etory for living apartments and
the fourth watchroom. Above all is
the lantern, containing a light of the
third order. Â«*ghty-four_ feet above
mean tide. The new lighthouse will
be fitted with hoisting machinery and
connected with the shore by telephone.
The position of the light is about one
and a half miles east of a line drawn
across the bay entrance and three
eighths of a mile distant from Point
Lobos. The situation* is one exposed
to violent gales and currents and In
winter will be isolated for months at
a time. Even In summer the position
of workmen engaged upon the. work
has often been precarious. In several
instances the men have been compelled
to pass the night on the rock, exposed
to pitiless storms and chilly winds.
Progress since construction began
has boen marvelously rapid. The light
\u25a0will be of infinite service to the navi
gator and will diminish the perils of
the bay entrance In a marked degree.

from : the pit shaft in ) which 150; men
were working. The force of " the explo
sion ; \u25a0 wrecked the machinery, at the

mountain roadways were crowded all the
afternoon : and there are now streams of
people in the neighborhood ot ; the mine,
all contributing, to the pitiful scenes.
Efforts at : rescue were still in prog

INQUIRY INTO
CUBAN RIOTS
Lack"; of Discipline Among
'the. Troops Showu in the
A l l nek Mad eOn the Pol ice
SOLDIEUS DISOBEDIENT
Sent to Qiiell Disturbance
in Havana, but Instead
They Add to the Disorder
HAVANA, July ILâ Two more deaths
have resulted from ;the conflict last
night between Cuban , artillerymen
and -civilians. Most of the score of
persons, reported injured sustained
slight. contusions inflicted by police
men's clubsi; The. first conflict occurred
between artillerymen and policemen
and toughs who infest the locality.
The ?, the company' of soldiers, who
were* : sent to restore order, mutinied
and fired on the police.
General , Freye Y. Rado. Secretary
of the- Interior, is rigidly inquiring Into
the Identity of the official who ordered
the company of artillerymen to that
district, and is also endeavoring , to
find 1 out who Is responsible for the
lack of discipline.. The lieutenant in
command of the artillery company says
he was 'ordered to the tenderloin by a
telephone message from artillery cap
tains who had previously arrived at
the police station to investigate the
participation of their men In the af
fair.
General Rado is ashamed of the lack
of discipline shown by the "manner In
which 250 soldiers under arms were so
easily excited into attacking the . po
lice. .The soldiers have long persisted
in regarding the police as their rivals.
'The body of the policeman. Amparo
Hernandez, was escorted to the cemetery
by 100 policemen and the municipal .band,
followed by Government and city offi
cials. "'i.=f3sjyaÂ£
The artillerymen are talking of taking
vengeance against the police. The Sec
retary of the Interior '! has ordered that
no artillerymen : be permitted to leave
Cabanas, fortress,, and a score of those
charged with the shooting have been im
prisoned : ., pending an examination by
court-martial into the affair. . "
The police captain who, aided by the
artillery captains, finally stopped the
disturbances, told the press that some
of the soldiers fired ten shots from the
houses into which they had crowded for
shelter from the police. The responsi
bility of bringing the detachment of ar
tillery to thÂ© scene appears to rest with
Lieutenant Aguado, who commanded it.
Captain Portuondo of the artillery, who
received a bullet wound in the Intestines,
died this evening.

"All the cotton crop now need* it a rood
epell of fine weather to permit planter* to cul
tivate St, and there Is Just as much probability
of good weather developments and conditions
as there Is otherwifie. ller.ee we think that
too much ie now taken for granted that the
crop will be a failure. We caanot undertake
to sÂ«y what the market will do from day to
day in the matter of fluctuation* while specu
lation Is still bo active, but until there is
â '->re positive assurance that can be offered at
present that the crop will fall under 10.000,000
bale* we cansot consistently purchase at such
prices unfier each strained market conditions
as now exist with the world* spinners having
cecured 13.000, 000 bales of last season's 14,000,-

Dried Fruits In Jfew York.
Late rr-ft.;; Bdvloes from New York s&y: .
For the time of the year the market for
coast dried fruit* for early fall delivery 1*
dull. Tbe demand so far has 1 been slow and
s, rood deal of r>ereuaslon seems to have been
required to Induce buyers to place the orders
they here given. In the case of Peaches and
apricots the reluctance to buy freely In ad-
vance of the actual tlzn* for shipping new crop
\u25a0 Â«aa in a measure due to early reports of Im
pending heavy crops. Now that the crop of
Peaches is demonstrated to fall far be-low
- preliminary estimates and the market on the
coast is hardening- there is little acceleration
of demand from buyers in thl* section. No
material reduction has been made of estimates
â¢ published at the beginning of the season as to
the size of the apricot crop. While It Is ad
mittedly a record breaker, approximatlnsr 1600
â¢ ears, the shortage in other fruit* on the coast
Inclines holder* to adhere firmly to "their quo
tation*. Tbe strength ot the prune situation
becomes more positively demonstrated each
<lay. From all accounts Banta. Clara stock Is
no longer obtainable below a 3c f. o. b. bag
- basis &nd the price of outside prune* has ad
vanced * quarter of a cent above the opening
- quotation to 2fco f. o. b. ba* basi*. The In
creasing show of confidence in the situation
that is made by sellers on the coast is inclin
ing buyer* here to make some provision for
the future. They have not reached the point
\u25a0where an abandonment of their conserratlx*
policy of buying seems to them advisable, and
xrhlle the cumber of orders going out to the
const is increasing, the majority, if not all of
them, are for one or two carload lot*. The ln-
Quiry for loose raisins, more particularly seed-.
>s? Muscatels and Sultanas for prompt ship
ment frota tfce coast, continues, but recent
purchase* apparently have closely absorbed the
offering*. Cpot currant* are qSlÂ«t but steady
on the basis of 4%e for uncleased In barrels.
The 'Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. O. McAdle. section
director of the climate and crop service of the
Weathtr Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
* \u25a0 The weather rai clear during the week, with
light for* in the coast districts toward the
close. High temperature* prevailed throughout
the State nearly all the week, and In many
places prevloois records were broken on the 7th

Los Angeles and Ean Diego S6.
Harvesting and thrashing are progressing
rapidly and hay baling continues. The grain
crop is somewhat disappointing and Is much
below early expectation* except In a few places.
In Southern California the yield of wheat and
IV. barley 1* the best for several years. Tbe hay
>trop is above average In nearly all sections.
I Fugar beat harvest continues; the yield is re
ported above average. Beans were not eeri
ously Injured by the heat and give promise of a
large yield. Hops, corn and potatoes were
benefited by the warm weather and are mak
ir.g rapid growth. i n some section* the yield
ef hops will be fully average.
Deciduous fruits and grapes were probably
Injured to some extent by tbe extreme heat, but
reports thus far do not give any reliable estl
rt'.atee. Fruit picking, canning and drying are
In progress and large ehfpinent* were made
during the week. Grape* are in market In lim
ited quantities. Lemoa shipments from San
!>:< co were unusually heavy. Oranges are In
good condition.

Ehaeta counties. Grain harvesting and thrash
â¢l . Ing tad hay baling ere progressing. The grain
crop is much below early estimates in yield and
quality, but the hay crop is excellent. Hops

ably- damaged deelduou* fruits, grapes and
tug'ar bef-U to some extent. Fire* caused great

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, July 11.â There was a rush to
Bell stocks to-day and the strong underlying
demand and the vigorous support which have
been in evidence for some time past were no
longer manifest. The consequence was a wide
decline in prices. The volume of dealings
Â«v not in excess of that for many single days
recently, so that the supporting of prices
chould have have been more burdensome than
before, but the disposition to do so- was evi
dently lacking. The selling' which had the
most effect on speculative sentiment was
rather ostentatiously by brokers credited with
representing the organised parties supposed to
have conducted the leadership of the recent
signal rise in the market. Some of the un
olflcial explanatlonns of this selling pointed to
various causes, some of them with a ceeo
lying eugeestion of a dry humor. Profits had
become so attractive as a . result of the ad
vance. It was explained, that the successful
holders were desirous of reducing their hold
ings and getting away from the intense heat.
Reports varied as to whether the comlnK de
partures were to be for Europe or simply for
a fiehlns: excursion. The franknees and can
dor of these explanations and the open man
ner of the realizing of their profits were taken
to argue a lack of- astuteness In the methods
of operators of such eklll and experience and
led to suspicions that the real process of profit
taking had been already large completed. The
relaxation of confidence in the future on the
part of recent *r>eculative leaders and their
spirit of rwignation to the falling course of
prices had a markedly depressing effect on
the miscellaneous operators, and they showed
a willingness to make sacrifices to get out of
their holdinss and limit their lesses. There
was really no news of effect In the market,
unices It might be the revived agitation of the
Equitable Life affair and the suspicion*
aroused by the cotton report scandal toward
the eraln condition report due after the close
of the stock market. Rates for time money
worked firmer In spite of the stock liquidation
in connection with the Japanees loan subscrip
tions, and the London market was affected by
the same cause. The rise in sterling at Paris
may have been due to remittances from that
center to share In the allotment of the Jap
anese loan. The weekly crop news was re
garded as promising: for the various crops.
The compilation of listings at the Stock Ex
change for the first six months of the year
shows the largeet aggregate of bonds for any
six months, and of stocks nice times the
amount listed in the first half of 1904. The
bonds representing new capital 'exceeded by
70 Der cent those for the first half of 1004
and more than twice the amount shown in
the first half of any previous year. Some spe
cial â¢ predisposing causes are recognized, 'es
pecially the advent of foreign government Is
sue* to this market. But the great volume
of capital thus offered for flotation makes a
clear incentive for the attempt to stimulate
interest in the stock ' market which has been
evident for the Dast few weeks. Last prices
were above the lowest, owing to the demand
from short* to cover and take profits on the
day, but the closing was heavy.
Bonds were easy. Total sales, $2,740,000.
- United Bt&tes bonds were unchanged on call.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
" Conditions and prices In the market for fresh
fruits showed little chance. Arrival* of. most
descriptions continued liberal and. with trade
of the usual routine character, the market was
rather weak than otherwise. There was seme
firmness in fancy Apples and Figs did a little
better under light supplies., but there was no
change In the other small tree varieties. Loose
Apricots ' were easier. In tone, as , the canners
were well supplied with contract stock, -and
the day's arrivals from across the bay came
to hand too late for the regular trade. In
the Berry line Loganberries and Raspberries
were ' firmer, .while Blackberries . and Straw
berries remained weak at - the old quotations.
There were liberal arrivals of -Melons -.; from
various sections/ but with trade fair prices
of good stock - were steady: Grapes .-were
difficult to sell. ' Four crates of Mu*cat. .the.
first of. that variety- for the, season, came In
from Indlo. . but ' were not sold ' . There were
liberal arrlavls of. Lemons by rail. and steamer
and the market was easier in consequence, but
the demand continued brisk and prices showed
little change. ; Other Citrus goods were steady
and. Mexican Limes bad another advance.

SAYS JOIST
WAS SEVERED
WITH AN AX
Dan P. Belden, Insurance
3lan, Subpenaed to Testify
About Collapsed Building
Before Coroner Leland
WITNESSES TELL
DIFFERENT STORIES
Carpenters 'and Plumbers at
Variance: Over Amount of
Bracing â Former Admit
Supports Were Removed
While the testimony of the carpenters
and plumbers who were working on the
Leaventritt building at Ninth and Te
hama streets prior to the time of its col
lapse as to the presence of sufficient
braces In the building. is mainly contra
dictory. Dan F. Belden. of the firm of
Strong, Belden & Farr, insurance agents,
Is authority for the ; statement that a
heavy joist on the 'top floor of the build
ing had been chopped in two with an
ax. Belden says that after the build
ing collapsed, , he came \ upon the fallen
beam, showing the marks of the ax, and
in view of his statement he has-been
subpenaed to testify at the inquest,
which will be finished this morning.
Another theory that has been evolved
in the Investigation is that the frame
building next to the Leaventritt build
ing was so insecure on its foundation
that the light breeze of Saturday caused
it to bump against the topheavy struc
ture being erected. The collapse of the
building from this cause might have been
aided by the removal from the fourth
and third floors of several braces neces*
' sary to their support. â..
II was developed at the inquest that a
somewhat Insecure form of construction
was adopted, inasmuch as the roof,
fourth and third floors " were rapidly
nearly completion, while the second was
left to the plumbers, so that they would
not Interfere with the work of the car
penters. William Henning,- the foreman
plumber, who was caught In the wreck,
testified that the building swayed slightly
at the top, then the second floor uprights
gave "way,- -the floor shifting toward Te
hama street. ; and the two top floors and
roof fell in a direct line to the ground.
The first floor remained firm. ; '_>>."/
FLOOR BRACES REMOVED.
WWIh the testimony of Henning showed
that he thought the building was not as
heavily braced as some he had worked
in, he was the only one who testified to
seing the building start to fall. None
of the carpenters who swore that the
building was securely braced saw the
beginning of the collapse. Besides de
scribing the accident, Henning's -testi
mony was principally concerning the
cutting Into the beams by the plumbers.
These cuts were shown to have had no
bearing on the collapse. He also testi
fied as to the position of Samuel Cowap
at the time he met -his death and of the
other workers on the first floor.
In working on the building, the car
penters began the finishing work by cov
ering the roof with tar. sheeting, and by
laying the fourth and third floors. Roy
Holliday, William F. Howard and F. W.
Redmond laid the flooring. To'do this
they were compelled to remove floor
braces and this was with the knowledge
of the foreman carpenter, Hiram Peter
son. Howard had charge of the replac
ing of them, but he testified that he was
called to assist the plumbers and the
braces were not put back.
ATJ JOIXIXG HOUSE INSECURE.
H. Gillard, a carpenter, testified that
the building next to the one being con
structed was very Insecure on its foun
dation and that he had often remarked
its swaying. In fact, â¢he - said that in
working on the new building he had
pushed the other a slight distance ; with
his hand. His statement was borne out
by a fellow worker, .A. E. Beck. - In
spector Horgan was asked if it was
safe to allow v such a building to remain
uncondemned and he answered that /it
was without his knowledge and that he
did not see how It was possible for such
a condition to exist. City 'Architect
Shea testified in the : morning that In
manjr cases . the Inspection of buildings
was a farce . owing to the Insufficient
force of inspectors.
: Other witnesses were called, . among
them Architect Albert Fair, who pre
pared the plans; Walter Key and F.W.
Redmond, carpenters In the building, ! and
Charles McLaughlin, who was paving the
street In front of the building when ; it
fell. McLaughlln was tripped by a board
and knocked senseless. The Inquest will
be resumed. at 10 o'clock this morning, and
a verdict may possibly be reached \by
noon. â¢ > ."

ROMANCE SHATTERED

Embraces Long Lost "Sweetheart and
His M
Midnight Reunion Bedelia
Ends in \ Arrest l (ff the iJady^
. Romance got another haymaker in
the solar plexus according to the- tale
of Peter Finn and .Bedelta Cunningham;
which : was unfolded in .Judge ; Conlan's
court yesterday. '
Peter, was ;walking along Sixth street,
near Howard, Monday " night - In a
reminiscent mood. From the saloon ; of
Augustus Rapp^ came i the strains of
"Bedelia," played Vsoulfully and sob
bingly upon =an accordeon.', -.
Peter brushed a tear from -his ; eye.
The ditty brought back vivid memories
of his first love. 1 Her name was Bedelia.
As the strains of the accordeon' floated
into the air Peter could almost: hear
her voice calling to the kitchen: "Pork
and; fry two over;" draw one small.". U
The rush of memories almost ; over
came him and he was about to make
a getaway into the chill, clammy night
when a female figure loomed ud in the
darkness. Something in the: coy man
ner in which she told the policeman to
get off her foot.attracted Peter's atten
tion. There was something familiar
in it.
The gas light lit up. her features. It
was Bedelia, the long lost. \u25a0"â¢' -
"Well, if there -ain't J the kid," ex
exclaimed Peter. "Oh, you 'Bedella.".
"Oh, you Pete," cried the lady Joy
fully. . \u25a0'.- .\u25a0\u25a0.;.-. . '- â¢" -\u0084 .:- : \u25a0
Peter got a half Nelson on his long
lost's waist and the lady caught a
strangle hold, round: his neck. In the
background the accordeon sobbed:
Bedeliar, I'd like to! steal yer,
Bedeliar. '. Bedeliar dear. - . â¢
:'. They were brought back to earth by
the stern voice of the -policeman call
ing "Time!" / : ':,
"Us to a steamery,". said Peter. ,"Oh;
you kid. Nix- cracking; onanymore
partings for us." â¢'.*,'' . . , ,-^ r .
- So the reunited lovers: hied* arm and
arm to the back room of Rapp's saloon.
"Bring us steams," [ ordered ; Peter.
"Turn on the taps and let 'er flow."
Meanwhile the pair, began exchang
ing reminiscences.
"Do you ; remember.' the day. you
smiled at Mickey McCann at the boiler
makers' picn ic I and ! I'â¢ pu t > him to sleep
for 'a* week?" â¢' asked iPeter.' '; v ; . _ ,
"Do-I?"; said- Bedelia.7 "Sure,.; I do.
Remember' the day I soaked you on; the
mush with T a? chunk : of watermelon?
You wouldn't' speak _to 'me for a week.
You went Vbuttingi around with, *that

"You certainly did -hand her a ; wallop.'.',
With their ; arms 'twined round leach

the i steam.' - <".- S ' ;.\ . - -. ; V \,;
Reluctantly . Peter \ withdrew^ his I arm

Grand Jury Wants City Re
imbursed for All Loss Sus
tained, Whether Through
Theft or^ Neglect of Duty
Having been advised by DUtrlct At
torney ; Bylnston -that the 'municipality
can '\u25a0 collect , the fall amount of former
Tax Collector. Edward .. J./i Smith's
$100,000 bond ' from the National , Surety
Company, the Grand Jury yesterday
forwarded a request to* City and County
Attorney ;> Lone t or hiÂ». opinion, he be
lnc the "-\u25a0 official ; adviser In the cnae.
After a prruKal of â¢ the ',- bond B ytneton
had' declared 'lts terms.to.be such that
the company was liable not only for the
actual '/amount known to have " been
stolen by the defaulting: official, but
also , for licenses ;' and taxes that he
neglected to! collect. The District At
torney' felt assured that the surety con
cern " : could be ; held | responsible ?, up * to*
$100,000 for all loses the city sustained
through ntgllgeiice and / Incompetency
as well as dishonesty on the part of
the.' public official . who Is now â¢'*Â» eÂ« r 1 n tf
the hated stripes In Folsom prison. 'The
total amount ,of ' Smith's . stealing, * ac
cording .to Douglna Young:, : the Grand
Jury expert, waa something over
$69,000. ,; ; \u25a0\u25a0-".";
The ;. Grand Â» Jury reported to Judge
Lawlor that It had asked the City and
County -Attorney, for his opinion and it
proposesito -see; to, lt Uhat the rights of
the l municipality" are asserted. :
The' jury also filed ai report that had
been made Ito ; it ? by,"- Expert Young -in
regard to hia investigation of the books
of Mitchell, - Mulcahy^ & .'Co.',;; through
which brokerage .firm Smith had specu
lated wlth^ the -city's funds. ..The : ac
counts showed that the dishonest Tax
Collector 'I had . made Investments 'â¢'. In
stock aggregating over, $140,000. '" ' V
' Smith had disposed :of all'hla hold
ings; according to the books, except 200
shares : of ; Southern f Pacific stock. \u25a0 :;If
he s sold \u25a0- them,: as " Is ; most f likely, the
proper . step ' of i having i the transfer ap
pear ; oh " the books had not -been taken.
The City Attorney ; has ; filed an - attach
mention -these 7 200: shares, but efforts
to ascertain iwhere.they^ are 'have thus
far : proved futile. - '\
;\The "total"; amount of. purchases of
stock made from the brokerage firm, by
the ithievlng T; official was $142,475 ; and
the : total .1 amount . he realized in V the
sale jof :>.the \u25a0\u25a0} holdings;: was $135,012 50.
Accounting, , however, ;. for the "value "\u25a0; of
the ? Southern {Pacific stock, â¢ which," ac
cording .-â¢ to the books , he > had , not dis
posed of, it. would appear that .the Tax
(Collector, who was \u25a0 plunging, wildly , to
recoup.'hls fortunes, ; came out. about
even iii: these deals.
\u25a0-'.-. ln addition to < Its \u25a0 report In the Smith
