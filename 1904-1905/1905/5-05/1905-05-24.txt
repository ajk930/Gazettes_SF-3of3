threw a lighted match .beneath v the

Howard Gould, which was left standing
in front of a garage at Thirty-third street
and Fifth avenue shortly after s 6 o'clock
to-night, the â¢ expensive machine w ; as
partly wrecked by an explosion and then
almost consumed by . the burning gaso
line that escaped from Its tanks.' . The

by the pillars of * flames which; were

From .the Waldorf-Astoria a fire alarm
was sent in. When.the: engines and other
apparatus were' arriving, Fifth avenue,
always filled with vehicles oi all descriu

Drivers of " carriages containing ' persons
of wealth; and prominence sought to es

He realized that he was down and out,
helpless, disgraced and alone. Mechanic
ally he strode from the * courtroom' be
tween the two ' attorneys," trying to , the
last to assume an attitude 'of unconcern,
but the effort was a ghastly one. Ha was
taken to the Broadway Jail to await
transportation to Folsom.
One of the parting shots of Judgo Law
lor rang in his ears as : he passed out:
"A person so convicted may never again
hold a .position of honor m . the State or
hold any position of . public trust."
- Nobody visited the criminal ; last night.
His brothers.* who had been : with him
through all hl3 ' ups and â¢ downs, did not
make their appearance yesterday \u25a0at all.
The .woman whom he had wronged moat
of allâ bis wifeâ did not go near him.
- Folsom prison was Smith's own " selec-f
tion. At one time he held an honorable
position at San Quentln and ha did 'not
care to " face . those whom, he had known
when he could look all men in the face.
He Lwill be -, taken away : the - latter part

" Foreman Andrews of the Grand. Jury
still maintains that there were others
involved with Smith -in his stealings.
Andrews declares that the Grand Jury
will not abandon its Investigation until
the entire ;\u25a0 conspiracy is uncovered ; and

He was appointed in 1888 a special
agent by the United States Department
of Agriculture to Investigate the pornoy
logical conditions of the ' Pacific Coast.'
His report Is a valuable one. Aside
from these strictly professional ser
vices Professor Wickson has served
several times as secretary and presi
dent of the San Francisco Microscopical
Society. He was the first president of
the California Floral Society when it
was organized in IESB. He served ten
years as a School Director in Berkeley
and for two terms was president of the
board. He Is also a trustee of the Cal
ifornia Polytechnic School at San Luis
Obispo.
Professor Wickson has been connect
ed with the university since 1879, when
Erofessor Hilgard, then at the head of
the college of agriculture, called him
from the secretaryship of the State
Horticultural Society, a position he had
held continuously for fifteen years. He
became a lecturer on dairy husbandry
at the university in 1879, and later
was made a lecturer on practical agri
culture. In 1891 he was promoted to
the associate professorship of agricul
ture, horticulture and entomology and
given charge of farmers' Institute
work. He was elevated to the profes
sorship of agricultural practice in
1697. Professor Wickson's V>oks ou.
agricultural topics, including "Califor
nia" Frclts and How to Grow \ Them"
and "California Vegetables In Garden
end Field." arc well known.
Tbe Importance of this position is
magnified by the action of the State
Legislature In appropriating large
sums of money for a great agricultural
farm to cost $150,000 and for a new ag
ricultural college building to cost
about the same amount. All of the ex
ecutive work necessary to be done in
connection with the work of the col
lege under these Improved conditions
will be In Profesor Wickson's â¢ hands,
the position being, regarded as very
much more important now than In the
past, although it has always *>een a re
eponsible post
As Professor Hilgard haa exceeded
the age limit of 70 years, it Is not'ex
pected that he will again have office
except as professor emeritus -in - the
college of agriculture. Professor Wick
son is regarded as being certain to re
tein the directorship of the college for
an Indefinite period.

NEW YORK, May 23.â "1f is a thing
wholly unique In railway construction,
and, I personally believe, reaches the
maximum of strength and safety in a
postal car," was the comment of Victor
J. Bradley, superintendent of the rail
way mail service, after an Inspection of
the new Erie Railway postal car at Jer
sey City to-day. V.
The car ' was built from designs . pro
vided by . the railway . management and
embodied suggestions as to what a per
fect mail car should be, both for com
fort and safety. It* goes somewhat be
yond . the exacting, specifications of /the
Government "as to railway postal cars,
alike as to strength, utility and comfort.
These Improvements have, met with the
approval of the postal officials here and
In Washington.
The exterior of the car is entirely of
steel. Its. Interior fittings, Eortlng tables,
letter, racks and all \ other necessary
woodwork are of fire- prooofed wood. It
Is. therefore, practically uninflammable. It
is sixty-five feet in length, weighs 100,700
pounds and Is mounted on standard . six
wheel trucks. Its. under framing Is said
by builders to be the.- strongest and
heaviest | ever j rolled, making It more
nearly proof against telescoping than any
car ever t constructed.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE}
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
"On last Thursday Young , soldj out his
interest'toF.E. Davis, who was "one of
the directors. The sale was conditional
and Young will- make no effort to shirk
the responsibility of the. debts. He is a
man of considerable'; wealth and , wilKsee
that creditors '.will |be paid dollar for dol
lar. " He was? married to^a Los Angeles
.lady a =few weeks -ago; and -had just re
turned from 'his - honeymoon when the
rush. to the outlying and newly discovered
districts Â£He immediately ;\' took
steps to gather funds and lt.was for this
purpose that -He came to San Francisco.
We would have taken ;up \u25a0 the necessary
cash, but when' Boals closed the bank no
national banks ; could' deal with us.' ", v - .
... '.'I have no with the bank
and am not even attorney; for it. I sim
ply i represent Mr. , Young In his personal
affairs and do not understand how I have
bfen, dragged into this, matter: ;-The two
notes referred to in. the dispatches, were
never ; cashed ; and -were given \ by- mining
companies In, payment for "legal, services.
It may be . that I am 'charged . because 1
overdrew : , my account to the extent of
$1100. * This ; can readily be made good," as
It was an error by Boals, and the money
should { have been / charged ' to " other >, per
sons. '. I have $6000 on . deposit fln the in
stitution and am not worrying about it."
"Matters â¢ looked serious last week and
Mr. i, Youngs came to this city, to ne
gotiate -a , loan ; w^th the First National
Bank of San Francisco. He brought, some
$25,000; In -t securities witb~hlm; and Â» when
these were presented- to.rViee -, President
Lynch of the local bank no question was
raised as to their validity. Negbtlatkms
for a large loan that would have put. t"Be
bank ion Its feet would have been com
pleted -Monday had ' not ; Boats closed the
bank- and left the town. When I. left
Gbldfleld last S, Saturday evening . R > was
understood .that Boals should stick to
his post.' Had he done this, even though
his : funds were exhausted, there would
have been no trouble, of this kind.. The
other bankers ; In- the town had agreed
to help him out. ,
"There remained in the bank when
Young departed , the previous Thursday
assets to the extent of $30,000 and pos
sibly more. I suppose they can be pro
duced now. The assets comprise little
mining stock..'; Notes of reputable .busi
ness men, properly 'indorsed, compose the
bulk. Most of these are not yet due, but
payment on. many of them will; be made
at any time. * We have plenty of backing
and have "no fear as to the; -outcome.
When I arrive in Nevada we shall place
all the assets in. the hands of a receiver
and creditors will be paid. I do not think
the liabilities amount* .to more than
$40,000 but on this' figure I would not be
sure, as I. have not had time to examine
the books. We can produce assets to the
extent of $56,000 and full payment is al
most assured:
<' X A CONDITIONAL SALE.
When first taken into custody Young
and Burton were not disposed to discuss
the bank failure. They said they were
about to return; to Goldfield, and their
railroad tickets were, in' their possession.
It was Burton's intention to apply for a
receiver immediately upon his arrival
home and to straighten out the affairs'
of the bank as far as possible. The pris
oners assert, that the assets of the insti
tution are sufficient to cover its liabilities
and that the doors will open again very
soon. To the action of Cashier J. R.
Boals in making an attempt to escape
from the mining district they attribute
tho criminal 'proceedings, "but they appre
hend nothing serious and hope to satisfy
the creditors. , In explaining . the banlTs
embarrassment j Burton said:
"The bank was sound financially until
three weeks ago," when 3000 people rushed
for the newly opened . districts around
Lida, Kawick T and '. Bullfrog. Many of
.them were depositors in the Goldfleld
Bank. They took their money with them,
as :they needed it in making locations
and purchasing property. In this manner
about^ $25,000 was drawn out in ,a few
days and our funds began to run at low
tide. It can be" easily understood. that a
bank in that section of the country does
not ; carry any large â¢ amount of cash.
There are no secure vaults and the region
is too isolated. ,
YOUNG WAS .HONEST.
Jackson B. Yonns, president of the
Goldfleld Bank ; and Trust Company/
and '- Fran el s > L." ' Burton* attorney for
Young, were arrested last evening: by

The city officials and Sheriff Barrett feel

tho same time protect wagons in the
downtown streets. It would require a
force cf at least 2000 men to effectually

been determined therefore that at the

made upon Governor Iteneen for military
assistance. Four thousand men are

"Peace? I am not looking for peace.
I am in this thing now to fight it 'out.
We may just as well have it over once for

Edward Hines, president of the 'Asso

that the members of the organization'pro
posed to stand together and when asked
if peace was in sight, said:
A meeting of the United Employers'
Association of Wood Industries, which Is
composed of five associations embracing
135 firms owning lumber yards, planing
kaftbi sash and door factories* -etc., was
held to-day, and it was decided ' tq call
upon their drivers to j make deliveries.
This will force out 1800 additional men.' :
The spread of the strike to-day was
not as great as was expected, it having
been understood in many quarters that
there was still a possibility of peace-
Four hundred and sixty-two drivers em
ployed by twenty-eight firms belonging
to the Lumbermen's Association went
out. In each case the men were ordered
to make deliveries to boyeptted houses,
and the usual strike followed. Other
firms to the number of fifty-five belong-;
ing to the Lumbermen's Exchange will
make similar requests of their men to

full number of 2000 drivers employed by
these concerns will be on strike.

Ing toward a peaceable adjustment was
held at 6 o'clock to-night between James
B. Barry, business agent of the Express

of the seven express companies. The
conversation was brief and pointed. Busi
ness Agent Barry opened the negotia
tions by saying:
"Our position Is this: I want all the
men reinstated except those who have
been guilty of violence. I cannot do
anything different. That is what the lo
cal union wants and that is what the
local officers nave told me to demand.
That is all I can do. The men told me
that they want to go back In a body or
they won't go back at aIL That is the
position of the union and the union of
ficials."
The */ply of the representatives of the
express companies was:
"Our opposition to the reinstatement
cf the men will be the same four years
from now as it is to-day. We will not
take them back under any circum
stances."

A year ago A. G. Munn turned over the
management of the hotel to Jackson and
kept only a general supervision over his
work. The place prospered, but a few
months ago there was a decided falling
off in the receipts. Then a guest left
the hotel and the books showed that he
owed a large amount for board and Munn
wrote . to his mother in the East. The
money was sent and was received by
Jackson, but no credit was made upon
the books.
; , A second letter was sent and the reply
fell into Munn's hands and disclosed to
him that Jackson, his manager, had re
ceived the money and pocketed it.
LAST OF THE BOUNTY
SWINDLERS CAUGHT
Gang Alleged to Have Rob
bed Western States Out
of Big. Sums.
DENVER, May 23.â With the arrest in
this city to-day of James Rumsby and his
father-in-law, James Riggles. police of
ficials believe they have captured the last
of an alleged gang of bounty swindlers,
who are said to have operated in Utah,
Nevada and Wyoming, and through
whom the State of Utah ; alone. has been
swindled . out of more than $100,000. It la
,believed'the ; gang originally consisted of
seven .members and included a former
official of Salt Lake County. Utah.
The method- of operation was "to ship
into. States where bounties are paid. for
the ' destruction of wild animals , pelts
brought from South America and other
countries, where they . can be purchased
in quantities at a low figure. ' These skins
would be. delivered, to the State. or county
officials and a claim made for bounty pro
vided for by: law. . .
In the house occupied by the two men
arrested here were found boxes filled with
pelts, numbering . in the neighborhood of
80.000. \u25a0 / - â¢;r ! : : A-.\. . '
CHRISTIAXIA. May 23 â The upper houas
of the Norwegian Parliament to-day adopted
the Independent- consular service bill which
has now passed both houses of Parliament.
After the removals had been an
nounced the Mayor, made public the
names of the men he had selected' for
the places. They are Colonel Sheldon
Potter, to fill the office of Director of
Public Safety, and A. L. Acker, to be
Director of the Department of Public
Works ad interim. The fight over the
form of resignation was an important
one, in that the new directors can only
be qualified by the confirmation of the
Councils, which are controlled by the or
ganization. Each dismissed director re
ceived $10,000 a year, and together they
had control of 10,000 office-holders.
It is not likely that the Councils will
confirm the merj appointed by. the
Mayor, but they will hold tho offices
ad interim. The two dismissed direc
tors refused to use their influence* to
help the' Mayor in the anti-gas lease
fight, and this, led the Mayor to ask
the directors for their resignations.
' The news-' vbf the Mayor's action
spread quickly to every section of the
city. Every one wanted to know what
the organization was going to do. It
is ' evident that it is planning for a
great contest. The city election will be
held ih' November, when a Sheriff. and
Coroner, are to he chosen. The organi
zation candidate for Sheriff is Harry
Ransley, president of the Select Coun
cil and an advocate of the gas lease,
and it is likely that the reform organi
zations of .the city will center their
strength to defeat him.
While the Mayor refuses to say what
his future action will be regarding
other office-holders who oppose him, Jt
is believed that he is not through with
his work in this direction. The reform
organizations of the ci^y are continu
ing with a vim the plans to block the
lease. Ward meetings were held, to
night, the : largest of which took place
at the Bourse.

Frederick J. Shoyer, director of the
Department of Supplies, by direction
of the Mayor, suspended, pending an
investigation, Arthur H. Morrow, .as
sistant director of the department. â
The removal of Directors Smyth and
Costello did not come until . after the
Mayor had asked them to resign im
mediately. In reply each sent a letter
to the Mayor offering his resignation
to take effect when his successor should
qualify. Mayor Weaver answered them
by demanding their immediate resigna
tions. The answer the directors re
turned was to the effect that they had
tendered their resignations "in the
usual form and in accordance with the
provisions of the city cuarter." and
that they would stand by them as ten
dered. Weaver then ended the corre
spondence by sending to each a letter
of dismissal.

Every^ day San Francisco people drink Beer:
that is made abroad and in Various parts of the
United States who have never tasted the Beer
that Is made in this city.
A long journey may whet the anticipation for,

a food manufactured that could withstand the \

is a^ susceptible to atmospheric conditions as
any other product. *
If San Francisco lacked any of the ,
advantages for making good Beer there would
be some excuse for the consumption of the
imported varieties. But the hops, barley and"
water of California are unsurpassed, the skili
4 of San Francisco Brewers is unequaled, and the
Breweries of San Francisco are equipped with
every appliance for the production of a Beer of^
perfect purity and excellent flavor.
While you can get a pure and delicious Beer
that is made in San Francisco from California
ingredients by San Francisco men, it is neither
sensible nor patriotic to drink Beer that is made

NEW-YORK, May 23.â That American
universities barter in the. open market
for young men who give promise of ex
celling in athletics is charged in an arti
cle published \in McClure's j Magazine" tofv
June under the title, "The College Ath-
Jete: How Commercialism is Making Him
Professional.". Henry ' Beach " Needham,
the writer, names the s most prominent
Amerincan Institutions in his article and
cites individual cases in support , of his
contention that the system -.-; prevails
which makes prof essional athletes ? out of
college boys. It is charged that colleges
subsidize athletes in order to .secure
teams which shall shine In intercollegiate
contests. Victory, means lan -advertise
ment for the college which' has purchased
men who will insure a winning team. .

A number of other large companies
have had the same experience in the
Kyak field. About two years ago a
California oil expert named TVorthing
ton visited the Alaska oil fields, rep
resenting 1 the Standard Oil Company.
His report did not warrant operations
there by that company.
Two years ago they struck a gusher
at a depth of 300 feet, but it yields
only five barrels daily. The company
is now withdrawing from oil explora
tion after spending 5500.000. Its? ex
perts find that the strata is so broken
as to prevent any pressure on the oil
below, and la conseauence there is no
flow.
TAcOAIA, May 23. â Three years of
development work have shown" tnat
the oil fields about Kyak and Catella,
In Alaska, will not â¢ rival , those of
Pennsylvania. Something: like $1,000.-
COO has been spent by various compa
nies in exploring for oil without tan
gible results, according to reports re
ceived from Kyak.
The leadintj development work has
been taken by the Pacific Coast Coal
and Oil Company, operating on lands
leased from the Alaska Development
Company. . The Pacific Coast Coal and
Oil Company is known as an English
company, its stockholders including Sir
Edward Stracy of London and Mc-
Kenzie and Mann, owners of the Cana

"When we, the citizens of Oakland, look
at how. much we have done for our. city,
when we look at the great boulevard
surrounding Lake Merrltt. at our drives
and roadways, at the magnificent design
of our City Hall, at our development of
Lake Merritt. at our parks and places of
amusement, we cannot help but feel that
while nature has done much for us, our
citizens in completing . these public works
have placed a fitting finish to the natural
charms of our, city. But there are work
ers;- In Oakland who are " going steadily
ahead, . building up, and tjpiese are the
people who' are making our city."
W. J. Gorham, Mayor of Alameda, told
of the beauties of his city and their hopes
for development" and harmony with the
county at large. '"

a consolidation of the cities he wanted
it under Mayor Frank K. Mott.
TIIKOWS A NEAT BOUQUET.
TV*. S. Palmer, superintendent of the
Southern Pacific Company, spoke for the
railroads. He covered much Important
ground, and said that how was the time
for Oakland to help itself. He produced
many valuable statistics, and showed that
while 500.000 tons of freight were shipped
directly from Oakland every year, over
five million tons were taken to San Fran^_
clbco and there shipped. He declared
that the shipping development of Oak
land would be along the western front
where sllÂ»g could be dredged and high
land be made at the same time. He said
that railroads must not be regarded as
antagonistic 'to the people, but that there
must be a community of interests.
Congressman J. R. Knowland had a
few modest words to say about Oak
land harbor. He disclaimed any credit
for the harbor appropriation, saying that
that belonged to other public men in
"Washington and the delegates sent on by
the Oakland Board .of Trade, but he ad
ded: "I do say that there Is no place
where the Government has spent money
In harbor Improvements such as has been
spent upon Oakland harbor that has pro
duced as great results for commerce."
Mayor Frank K. Mott announced a
definite plan for his administration, and
asked the formation of a citizens' com
mittee to carry out his Idea of an appro
priation for a city hall. He said: "The
city beautiful Is aa-important as the city
commercial, so let. us dress our com
munity In a new garb. I have had it in
mind to make a suggestion . for a new
City Hall, and I believe that this is a
proper occasion, and I ask that a citi
zens' committee be formed at once, to
advtee' and aid In carrying out this
work."
11. C. Capwell, president of the Board
of Trade, opened the meeting by taking
a little fling at San Francl3co, saying:
"There are many who claim for San
Francisco greater advantages than Oak
land. It may be true that we have no
Smith of evil fame, on Indeed a Schmitz,
but we will place in comparison with
the latter our Mayor, who Is possessed
by Oakland and who does not posses
his city." " \u25a0 i
Supervisor Judge Henry A. Melvin was
introduced as the toastmaster and many
happy introductions were offered by him.
Governor Pardee told of his early days
lr^ Oakland and of his great, hopes for
the future of the city of his home. He
referred to. the . cities, of Berkeley and
Alameda as "coy sister cities .whb won't
come under the wing of Oakland."
Senator Perkins told of the harbor of
Oakland and Alameda and said: "You

till Saturday night, by which time it is
expected that all the cocoons will be
completed. ;,'
The sidewalk in front of the Geary
street show windows of "Weinstock,
Lubin.& Co.'s silk house was blocked
with people yesterday. A thousand
silk worms had been placed in the
window and will be kept there until
they have spun.
The .worms are from China and were
procured through the influence of Min
ister Conger. The worms are. shown in
all the different stages passed through
before the costly strands are ready for
the manufacturer, and in addition there
is an exhibit of silk in all the various
stages of manufacture, so that it is
practically an exhibit of silk in every
stage from cocoon to customer.
The window is artistically decorated,
the rich cream color of the worms. , the
dark green of the mulberry leaves upon
which they feed and * the golden sheen
of the silk making a beautiful picture.
Yesterday the worms were feeding.
By to-night. or to-morrow they will be
gin to spin. This is the most interest

busy little workers weave for them
selves the cocoons- from /which they
never emerge . they; throw out what is

GREAT AMOUXT OF COMMENT
A stunning picture she -was in a pale
green frock, a white poke bonnet set
quaintly on her copper-hued hair and a
red. red rose at her belt.
In the tearoom' an informal reception
was held In honor of Miss Lillian Albert
son, the talented young woman who will
fill leading roles with the Bishop com
pany.
But Â« I am * told that at the eleventh
hour Mrs. E. P. Scheel, general manager
of the recent festival at the Palace, read
a report that sent a thrill of joy through
the dazed assemblage, when she an
nounced that the fete had proved a suc
cessâthat J1705 had been turned Into the
treasury, and more to come. "Good
news!" voiced the members, and then
followed a lot of reciprocal compliments,
diplomatically distributed, to which even
the press and the members thereof had
a share. Thanks. Jadies. thanks!
After a pleasant word xtt appreciation
and of leave-taking by Mrs. A. R. Cot
ton, the ladies adjourned to the tea
room, where, instead of a brandy and
sodaâ the tipple of weary men folkâ the
surviving: members enjoyed a bracer
brewed by a charming and indefatigable
tea committee. And thus was the winter
season of 1905 bravely brought to a close
and -adieus said for the. summer.
But what will become of the "town
meanwhile?
But seriously, there was much to ponder
over In what those good women said.
One-hundredth part of it would furnish
enough texts to go the rounds of the town
next Sunday, and live texts, too.
There were reports of committees that
caused to be created the Juvenile Court,
the Detention Home, the Parental School,
together with the law of compulsory
education, committees for the temporary
lelief of the -unhappy inmates of the City
and County Hospital, for the establish'
ment of a Tuberculosis State- Hospital
land which the naughty Governor rudely
interrupted by the "pocket", process), for
traveling libraries, for the art and music
achievements of the club, for the fight for
the preservation of .Telegraph Hill and
the annihilation of its destroyers, for
clean streets, for clear streams, for the
preservation and the conservation of the
forests of the State, for the suppression
of fireworks in the city, forâ well, here's
where., consciousness left me, and it is for
others to say what followed.
\u25a0Thus the reports wtnt en, each t6 the
bitter tnd, and when the last was
reached, after three long lingering hours.
there were a few women in the room,
besides the plucky little president, . who
bore up bravely under it all. But most of
the club had meanwhile sought the tea
room for a stimulantâ tea, of course
where a merry chatter was on, and some
fun.
Yesterday was a notable day for the
California Club. If there is to be nothing
doing at the club for three months the
score was more than evened yesterday,
when every blessed little woman who has
served the club as chairman of a depart
ment of a section or of a segment of a
stction rendered a reportâ a report made
gay with statistical trimmings and the
ravishing embellishments of detail., O, it
was lovely.'â and so terribly interesting
to those who were working in that par
ticular activity.

CAPTAIX HEALEY SPEAKS.
Van Duzer called attention to the fact
that each year when appropriations had
been made to carry on the* legal battle
with the Spring Valley the rate had ex
pired and a new one had been established
before the litigation had ended. It would
be the same this year, he said.
"Are we then not to fight the Spring
Valley suits, simply because the rates
fixed expire before a decision is reached?"
asked Supervisor Gallagher.;
"Under section 1, article 14 of the con
stitution," replied Van Duzer, "any pub
lic utility corporation that charges n
greater rate than that fixed by th& Su
pervisors immediately forfeits its fran
chise. All that is necessary is to demur."
Braunhart called Van Duzer's attention
to a charter amendment that ' permitted
the Geary-street road acquirement. He
also said the board was| allowed -to pur
chase property for permanent improve
ments outside the bond issue not to ex
ceed the amount of $50,000, providing the
tax limit of $1 was not exceeded. Van
Duzer said it was an evasion \of the
spirit of the charter to buy $25,000 w*orth
of land one year for a certain purpose
and $25,000 worth during each of two
succeeding years, making the total
$75,000. "--
Brandenstein said there was no doubt
about the legality of the board's act in
the Telegraph Hill matter and it was
satisfied with the propriety of it.
â¢ Various districts of the city, through
their representatives, presented | to < the
Supervisors last night their claims for
recognition in the annual budget, soon
to be adopted. - Mayor Schmita was in the
chair and every citizen who wished was
allowed to speak In favcr of the section
he represented. The closing part of = the
session was the most Interesting, owing
to A. P. Van Duzer making an objection
to the appropriations to 1 , purchase land
for Telegraph Hill improvements, topay
the cost of fighting the Spring Valley,
litigation and to acquire the Geary-street
railrcad.

-A' humorous incident, occurred while
Mr. Fickert was addressing the jury.
The sound of very boisterous laughter
was heard proceeding . from the lobby,
shocking: the judicial calm. " Judge de
Haven signaled Deputy. United States
Marshal Benas with ' one :Of ; those
glances that have so 'often congealed
the terror stricken hearts of presump
tuous attorneys,". to go forth and quell
the . sacrilegious, disturbance. Benas
bolted doorwards and made a discovery.
Out in the corridor he ran into the noisy
group. Those who had; set /Judge de
Haven's nerves .on edge were United
States Circuit Judge, Morrow, Customs
Colleptor Stratton, Senator j William C.
Ralston and a stranger, while: Clement
Bennett stood cautiously just outside
the fringe of the storm. The appear
ance presented by the, thunder-stricken
bailiff caused the party to retire to a'
secluded nook where they 'could weep
without being heard.
Some time this afternoon or evening
the fate of ; Cress ~Unger, ' formerly
seizure clerk of the Custom-house, will
be decided by the jury. ; The court ad
journed at .41 o'clock: yesterday.;after

writing." continued . Dr. Kahn when the
document was shown to him. "I can
identify it positively. I am as sure of it
as 1 am of the fact that George D. Col
lirjs informed me that that woman was
his wife when he called me to attend
She stuck to this assertion yesterday,
though Acting Foreman E. J. Bowes of
the Grand Jury has the testimony of nu
merous witnesses to contradict her. One
by one the Jurors fired questions at her,
each more pointed than the one before.
Mrs. McCurdy several times declared.
"I will not answer. You have no right
to &sk me that,"
Assistant District Attorney Isadore
Harris also questioned the woman. Final
ly she went into hysterics and had to be
taken from the Jury-room. She was as
sisted into the District Attorney's office
and Collins was telephoned for.
The woman Immediately told of the
crfleal she had been through and Collins
first raged, then turned to soothe her. "I
h&ve nothing to 6ay now. only this, that
this investigation will be stopped before
12 o'clock to-morrow," Collins announced.
Mrs. Charlotte Newman Collins, the
wronged wife of the accused bigamist,
was also before the Grand Jury*. She re
told her sad history and reasserted her
rights as the wife of Collins.
An important witness caned yesterday
was Dr. Adolph Kahn, who was the first
Mrs. Collins' physician when Consuelo
Collins was born eleven years ago. He
was summoned to the jury-room and Mrs.
Collins, the first wife, was brought to the
door.
"Do you know this woman?" asked act
ing Foreman Bowes.
"1 do," replied Dr. Kahn. "She is the
mother of the child known as Consuelo
Collins. Attorney George D. Collins when
he called me to attend her said that she
was his wife."
Under the relentless questioning of the
Ennui jurors yesterday Mrs. McCurdy,
mother of George D. Collins' '.atest wife,
became hysterical. . "You are not gentle
men." she declared. "You have net the
right to ask such questions. No gentle
man would persecute a woman so.**
When Attorney George D. Collins, who
arrived to escort his second mother-in
law fiom the Hall of Justice, heard of
tbe ordeaJ she had been through he flew
into k rase.
â¢Til have this investigation stopped be
fore 12 o'clock to-morrow," he thundered.
"It is outrageous."
Mri. McCurdy was on the grill fcr over
an hour. She was plied wuh questions
ail centered around her statement that
George D. Collins did not live with his
second wife, Clarice McCurdy Collins,
whiie in the State of California.

Foreman Andrews Intended . to resume
his : official r position yesterday, but : the
Jury's investigations were not concluded
until after Judge La wlor had left and he
was unable to do. so.
Another ,of ' .the-.: numerous
asked the Commissioner was why Morris
Levy -was . not discharged' from- the* em
ploy of i the : Board of Public Works, 'as
the .board had announced -Levy: r was
granted a six weeks' leave of , absence
instead. The ' investigation will, be . re
sumed" to-day^ . - ".
The Grand" Jury began an Investigation
yesterday of : ; the \u25a0 Public "Works Depart
ment. ."; Commissioner r Argeltinger . \u25a0 was
called as a witness. He' was closely ques
tioned ; regarding * the Weber Music Hall,
which has g been 'opened in the * quarters
formerly > occupied -by - the f Terrace Garr
dens. .; Foreman Andrews 'and Acting
Foreman â¢ Bowes " are certain ;that the
place is being- run without a." license.
: 'Aigeltinger^was i asked \to j enlighten the
jury, on | that ! point, but \ was unable to do
so *, without \u25a0. the records of the : office. ;, The
Commissioner,' declared \ that he did - not
know whether or :\u25a0 not the place had ob
tained >Â»a* license.; He promised to .look
into the matter to-day | and declared that
if the,! proprietors had not complied with
the i law; the place" would De closed.
'. "When; Algeltlnger was questioned f as to
why no steps were taken regarding other
theaters .which are under, the ban of the
Grand Jury,: the Commissioner, explained
that the Board of Public AVorks refrained
from acting against them* on. the advice
of City /Attorney Long. "
; He was, asked why the Board of Works
did not act against the "notorious resort
at 620 ; Jackson : street. ,, Aigeltinger de
clared that the temporary "restraining or
der granted â¢ by ! Judge Seawell made ! such
action impossible. " \u25ba" ' % - "\u25a0' 5

The doctor does not say how he proposes to enforce his bare
faced reform. He intimates that it. may be done by law. We think,
however, he will have to fall back on professional ethics. When
medical colleges refuse a degree to a bearded graduate. lie will be
willing to enter the profession by a close shave. Laymen have
some questions to ask in this matter. If a doctor's 'whiskers hide
microbes, what does the lay beard do? True, the doctor in the
f-ickroom has a better opportunity to acquire a stock of germs than
ihe layman has, but is it not possible that every bearded citizen is
a peril to the public health ? If so, the state, in pursuance of its'
police powers, may lather and shave everybody.
But should the reform stop there? Is it not a halfway measure
to take the hair off a man's.face and leave it on his head? Has not
nature played a low down. trick on us by giving us hair at'all? If
whiskers catch germs, the hair of the head: must do the same, and
the only really safe citizen is the smoothly shaven man with a
beautiful bald head. This may have been understood of old. When
the children jeered the 'prophet and said "Go up, old Baldy/'tney

very properly eaten by forty she bears.

DR. KENNEDY, who is described as a member of the lowa
Board of Health, has started a crusade against doctors' whis
kers. He finds" that hair on a doctor's face is a catch-all for
colonies of microbes, capable of spreading a great number of dis
eases. He impeaches whiskered doctors .rather severety. It is
intimated that they maintain their practice by peddling microbes
from door to door in their whiskers. Even' bearded doctor is a

To the Editor 'of The Call:
Touching: upon this subject of de
positing the sewage of our*clty in the
bay^ and the possible danger liable to
result thereby, will you allow me to
furnish an example for study?
I have good authority for stating
that the harbor of Santos In Southern
Brazil was at one time considered one
of the deadliest places along the line
of - shipping. British sailors rebelled,
even jto threatenlngs of mutiny some
times, rather than go to Santos. In
vestigation and reasoning , showed It
was not malicious disobedience, but a
right to refuse to go to what appeared
to bs certain death.
Santos is an Important harbor, the
gateway for the* State of Sao Paulo to
the main, one of the richest coffee
bearing provinces. \u25a0 Some remedy must
be had. Somewhat like San Diego bay,
landlocked and a heavy growth of tim
ber on the sea side of* the horseshoe,
breezes could not circulate well. The
trees; were. removed and It was forbid
den to throw dead animals and ' other
decaying animal matter Into the
bay. These . two difficulties Having
been overcome Santos can to-day boast
of a vastly different sanitary record.
For an almost tropical port she can..
furnish a pretty clean health record.
Sewage deposited. In our bays and
streams aided by unusual heat or light
er winds may some oft . year - surprise

But what Interests me most about the
situation Is this matter of the^ attraction
of opposites. For it offers one more ar
gument in support of that theory of Har
riet Beecher Btowe that "there is noth
ing in the -world so congenial as differ
ences. -To be sure, the differences must
be harmanious, . In music, now, for in
stance, one doesn't want a repetition of
the same note, but differing notes that
chord. Nay, even discords are indispen
sable to complete harmony." :-
Then it Implies a sincerity of their ap
pearance of devotion.. Rarely does an
American who does not love his wife
take the pains to hide his indifference.
He is civil to her. and he pays her bills,
and he lets ' her do as she pleases, but
he makes no pretense of an affection
which he does not feel.
His wife, on the contrary, is quite or
dinary in looks and manner. She is one
of that feminine multitude who spend
their little lives In alternately posing and
supposing. Yet ahe has a certain charm.
Short and plump. inÂ«the morning ahe per
sonifies good health and cheerfulness, for
she is as optimistic as a well-fed song
ster; at eVening she has a way of set
tling down comfortably into her little
round figure, like 'a tired canary bird.
It was a "love match. I am sure of It,
since the two people are American. Ware
they European one could not say for cer
tain, remembering that naive matrimo
nial advertisement which appeared last
winter in a Roman newspaper: "A poet,
humanitarian, of sensitive nature, poor
and alone, would consecrate his existence
to the service of a gentle lady desiring to
marry who would be disposed to assist in
the publication of his work and to share
In his success: Apply, etc., Milan."
Yes, they are American, and this single
fact contains a "whole volume of Infor
mation about them: First, it means that
they married because they fell in love,
and not merely because the poet needed
the wherewithal to float his ideas, be
cause he was "in a state of intellectual
independence, but economic instability"â
as I once heard a socialist who was hard
up eloquently describe such embarrass
ment.
He is - a genuine day dreamer, whose
fancies are ever flying like sea gulls be
tween the depths of- earth and the depths
of sky. now giving themselves up to the
breeze of current prejudice, which pushes
the minds of other passengers along, but
more often facing it with winged power,
borne up by it, and strengthened greatly.
One can see, just by watching the chang
ing lights in his face, that personalities
appear to him like impressionistic pict
ures, beautiful with color. Yet over his
eyes there always hangs the light mist
of poetic melancholy.
ONE ; of the most interesting of the
studies in ' love that I am making
on the steamship which is carrying
me to France is the mutual devotion of
a poetic husband and a prosaic wife, who
eit near me at the captain's table. Never
was better exemplified the attraction
which opposite, temperaments have for
each other.
Dorothy Fenimore is now in Paris,
having gone abroad to make a special
study for the benefit of The Call read

Below is the second of her observa
tions on shipboard.
While the pride of California is somewhat touched by the com
mittee's faulty itinerary, the State loses nothing that is of real im
portance. The loss is sustained, bv'the committee.
The Agricultural Department is keenly alive to the danger of
the mistake that is being made by taking California as the irrigation
and crop model for. land that is under .climate and \ crop I , conditions,
widely different from ours. That department is" proceeding in a very
practical way to save settlers on Federal irrigation much disappoint
ment and loss. 'It is moving to establish on ever}' tract irrigated by
the Government a demonstration farm in charge of practical men,
on which will be shown the kind of crops the region will produce
most profitably, the method of cultivation, seeding, applying the
water and all other demonstrations that may save settlers from
loss by proceeding by rule of thumb. All such settlers have to pay
back to the Government the cost of the irrigating systems which
supply their lands. They are allowed to own only eighty acres, and
from that limited holding must support themselves, meet all the
losses inflicted by wind' and weather, bad markets and high trans
portation, and also pay off the Government mortgage of $26 an
acre. They will have no time to waste in empirical farming. They
cannot lose many seasons in cut-and-try experiments, for that will
mean default in their obligations to the Government and the loss
of their land. The plan of. the Agricultural Department will save
much sorrow and distress and its demonstration farms may save the
whole Federal irrigation policy from wreck.
Perhaps it would be wiser for Congress to seek instruction from
the reports and work of- the practical men in the Agricultural De
partment rather than from the flying visits of Congressmen, who
are probably not practical agriculturists and are but little equipped
for proper digestion of what they see. The experts in the idepart
ment are not only trained scientistt, but baclrof that they are, ex
perienced farmers. They have tilled the soil themselves. in Kansas,
Minnesota, lowa, in the New England and Middle States and in
the South and in California. They know the science and art of agri
culture. They are employed by the Government for. what they
know, and Congress will do well to pay some attention to the reports
thej' make. It will save the expense of committees, which at best
can only duplicate the observations made, without adding anything
of value to the conclusions reached.
*r CONGRESSIONAL committee is coming West to make
l\ an examination of irrigation applied to agriculture and hor
**\u25a0 ticulture. After the itinerary of^the tour was made up, it was
found that the committee would make a brief stop at Yuma, would
spend two or three da\ r s in Southern California, and then would come
to San Francisco by a night train on- the Coast line and from here
would go north. As this cuts out all of the extensive applied irriga
tion in the San Joaquin Valley an effort was made to change. the
itinerary, but this failed. As this committee is making its inspection
with a view to reporting on the utility and cost of Federal irrigation,
it is to be regretted that it avoids the opportunity to inspect private
irrigating systems that would have served the purpose of comparison
with the public systems.
On June 17 the first Federal irrigating plant is to be instajled
in Nevada, taking its water supply from the Truckee River. It
is expected to irrigate about 250,000 acres at a cost for the water of
$26 per acre. If the committee had visited the* San Joaquin Valley
it could have inspected the Modesto and Turlock districts, supplied
with water from the Tuolumne River by the highest diverting dam
in the world, furnishing water for 250,000 acres at ;i cost of $10 per
acre. This would be an object lesson worthy of study. An expert
inspection of it might suggest economies that would be of import
ance to the Government. The committee might also have learned
that it is a mistake to suppose that irrigation everywhere, in the
values it will produce, is to be expected to yield results up to the
California standard. This mistake has been made by many super
ficial observers and enthusiastic writers and advocates of Federal
irrigation. This error has led to the conclusion that the high cost
of Federal irrigation is justified by the high returns expected from
:he irrigated land.
In the San Joaquin Valley the committee could have studied
the relation of irrigation to intensive farming, in a winterless climate,
and where the variety and value and number of crops in a season are
greater than in any other part of the world. The committee could
have learned that in the San Joaquin .Valley by irrigation are pro
duced oranges, raisins, the genuine Smyrna fig, and all other varieties
of that fruit, and a variety of deciduous fruits in number unknown
outside of California. Nowhere else in the world is irrigation applied
to as many kinds of crops as here. What is done in the San Joaquin
Valley can be done also in the Sacramento Valley, and a proper tour
of both would have given the committee information of the greatest
value to Congress, if that is what the trip is for.
If the tour is to be extended to the arid regions on the high pla
teaus, where Government irrigation works are under way, the com
mittee would have had before it the contrast of climates as an element
in the use of irrigation. It would have learned that, outside of
California the variety of fruit and field crops is far less in number,
and that the all-the-year-round succession of harvests in this^JState
need not be looked for in the regions where the season is short and
where winter conditions arrest all production. An official report on
this branch of the subject would save much future disappointment-of
settlers in the Federal irrigation districts. They are being led by
enthusiasts to suppose that the climate of California is found also
outside of California, and that of necessity California production fol
lows the climate. Our local isothermal lines do not project eastward
and northward.

Chief Dinan then shows the differ
ence existing in the number of detec
tive sergeants in San Francisco and
other cities. Los Angeles, with a much
smaller population than San Francisco,
has .fifteen detective sergeants, .and
Kansas City, of almost equal size, has
twenty-eight menlin the detective de
partment.
Srho necessity for the number being
increased involves only. an annual ex
penditure of $6000, whiie the work of
the department, says the Chief, Imper
atively demands the additional men.
The special men taken from the ranks
lack the authority that should be
given them when they are acting mere
ly as patrolmen in plain clothes and.
doing the work of detective sergeants.
The present staff of special men, ten
in number, has been faithful and al
ways wiKing and reliable for the ardu
ous duties exacted. From 9 a., m. to
10 p. m. . they are on duty, the same
hours observed, by the detective ser
geants. Moreover, of late there have
been many large robberies and â¢ one
murder mystery that has forced the
men to work overtime. This they have
always done without a murmur and the
Chief of the department and Captain of
Detectives Burnett feel that they
should have proper compensation. A
majority of the Supervisors are said
to favor the Increase and it Is expected
that the allowance will be made when
the matter comes up before the board
for hearing in'a few days.
In presenting his request Dinan ar
gues the justness of the demand for an
Increased salary. He points out that
the special men, while taken from, the
ranks, of necessity do more important
work than the patrolmen ' do. In the
performance of this duty they. are com
pelled often to expend small sums" for
which the city allows them no recom
pense. Only in the case >where a
voucher is presented by them is an in
cidental expense paid.
Chief of Police Dinan has presented
to the Board of Supervisors a request
that the number of detective sergeants
in the department be increased from
fifteen to twenty-five, as authorized in
the charter. At present the fifteen de
tective sergeants are assisted by spe
cial men taken from the ranks of the
patrolmen in recognition of good., ser
vice. These special men attend to the
duties usually assigrled to detective
sergeants and work the same hours.
They draw the pay, however, of patrol
men, $10Q a month, whereas the salary
of a detective sergeant is $150 a
month.
The Call's computation that the tax
rate for city purposes will be 51.1636 on
every $100 was verified yesterday. The
running expenses of the city govern
ment, together wijh the improvements
projected, will use up $1 of the levy.
Seven cents will be levied fqr the. parks
and 9.36 cents for the bond interest and
redemption fund, against 12.56 cents last
year. The fact that the bonds were not
Fold immediately resulted in a surplus in
the interest fund, which reduced the tax
required for 1905-6. The State rate will be
in the neighborhood of 50 cents, so the
total rate for all purposes will aggregate
approximately $1.6636. against $1.6555 for
this fiscal year.
Under the new arrangement the Board
of Supervisors will pass a* resolution di
recting the Board of Works to recom
mend the carrying out of a specified Im
provement. When the recommendation
has been made the necessary ordinance
granting the Board of Works authority
10 proceed with the work will be passed
and the contracts let. It has always been
necessary for the Board of Works to ask
for the required authority, and in two
cases where it did not do so the contracts
were declared void, notably ia the con
tracts awarded to F. M. Yorke & Co. for
the paving of H street and the repair of
bituminous pavements, both of which the
firm lost because the technical require
ments had not been complied with. It Is
believed that a specific direction from
the Supervisors that the board recom
mend the doing of the work will prevent
complications that might ensue. In /act.
the Board of Works would exact this di
rection, as the allowances for Improve
ments do not come within Its appropria
tion proper. . ;
The new budget very properly begins
with the appropriations for public better
merits under ' the caption "Permanent
Improvements." which constitute in
themselves a budget. But. the appropria
tions are rot placed under the caption of
the Board of Public Works.
In the municipal budget recommended
by the Supervisors' Finance Committee
the immediate control of the funds ap
propriated fnr public improvements is in
a measure taken away from the Board

Committee Decides Disputed Game Be
tween San Rafael Hfth School and
Polytechnic Mast Be Replayed.
The baseball committee of the Academic
Athletic decided last night at a
special meeting held at the , Cogswell
School that the disputed baseball game
between the San Rafael High School and
the Polytechnic High School should be
replayed to-morrow at 3 o'clock upon the
grounds at Golden Gate Park. This de
cision was of vital importance in deter
mining the winner of the local sub-league.
Had the game been given to San Rafael
High School the loss of the contest to
Polytechnic would have given the cham
pionship to the California School of Me
chanical Arts. As the decision now
stands it is likely the rival teams of
Polytechnic and Lick will again clash for
the hign honors.
The dispute arising in the game was
based on a ruling of the umpire. This
official declared, although a Polytechnic
runner safely touched the bag at first,
since the base had not been securely
fastened and was at the particular mo
ment not in its correct position, the man
was out. This occurred vruen Polytechnic
had two "down" and four tallies to their
opponent's flve, but had made a run
simultaneously with the put out at first.
The entire Polytechnic nine withdrew
from the field following the umpire's de
cision to discuss the situation. The dis
cussion of the Polytechnic delegation
lasted some minutes. When they de
clared themselves ready to continue the
game they were informed, as they had
violated the rules by withdrawing, the
same would be given to San Rafael.

ground at every jump and ran his race
in the same dull and half-hearted manner
that characterized his last appearance.
Jim Bozeman maintained a safe lead all
the way and was never challenged.

in the sixth race on The Lady Rohesia,
which was played from the time the chalk
was <, first posted until post time. -Her
price was pounded down from 7 to 1 to
6 to 6. The race was won by Sid Silver,
the favorite finishing outside the money.

around the source of effective and imposing
stlllng yesterday. The uncertainty had to
d> with the nature of to-day's buying , and
the question of its substantial motive. It was
the central supposition that yesterday's vio
lent declines would have a natural supplement
to-day in large additional selling orders. The
level of prices last night was quite generally
below the extreme decline of last month - and
having broken through ' that ' level the usual
course in a speculative market is a consid
erable additional decline. It became evident
very quickly to-day, however, that neither the
impairment of margins nor the nervous feeling
aroused by yesterday's weakness had resulted
In any considerable accession of . the ' selling
pressure. Public announcement was made al
most immediately of the suspension of - the
Merchants' Trust Company, and professional
bear traders followed their Invariable rule of
buying stocks to cover short contracts when
the bad news, which Induced the short selling
had come out. There was a very general
opinion that if trouble of this trust company
was the inducement to the selling of yester
day the pressure had been considerably over
done co that It .behooved the sellers to ! re
trace their course. It occurred to the vacil
lating mind of. the trader, however, that ; the
arrest of the selling in the early hours yes
terday was but a prelude to heavier selling
as the day advanced. The reaction of the
first hour In consequence wiped out practically
all of the gains. Tee second . upward move
ment was due to a feeling of reassuranct
that ' the pressure to sell did not develop thÂ»
dreaded urgency. Covering of short contracts
during the decline yesterday undoubtedly
played a considerable part in the " Wldar re
covery on the second movement. This â¢ wai
shown by the special prominence In the ad
vance of the stocks which suffered most on
yesterday's decline. When the urgent de
mand from the shorts .had been satisfied .the
scarcity of any other buying became con
eplcuous and hesitation and uncertainty over
came the speculative mind again. Immediate
news of the day had little to do with thÂ»
course of prices. The difficulties of the Mer
chants' Trust Company . have been generally
understood for some time, and their origin
in old * standing conditions deprived the In
cident of any power for violent effect. There
Is however, sufficient room for the drawing
of analogies and the recent expansion of the
activities of trust companies into new fields
and the large additions to their number have
received. active discussion. . The ease. of money
was unaltered, but sterling .'exchange continued
to advance. The market was practically in
a torpor \u25a0 during the latter part of the day
and practically all of the day's gains "were
yielded Tinder very light pressure of selling.
The close was easy and some of the market
leaders were below last nlKht. ,
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, par value.

STOCKSâ New York. May 23.â -The market
opened with a bettar ton* In evidence, but
pressure w&s reaujned with thÂ» result that
prices slumped off. TaÂ« closing was weak.
There was nothing new to explain the recent
eelUng. The genera.! situation and railway
earalnri cannot be more graUfving. A hard
enlr.g tendency In Eteel end Iron was noted,
trttu more inquirtea for finished material*.
Stocks htvÂ« declined from 12 to S5 points In
sixty days, and unless there are more un
favorable features they seem lew enough.
COPPERâ Boston. May 23.â The market
showed a slight rally at the opening, but as
â¢oon as the shorts had covered a small line,
prices eased oft again and the whole market
closed weak. Every one seems to be bearish
at present, but without any particular reason
except the scarcity cf buying orders. Tha
low-priced Coppers seem to be gradually sag
ging. We believe that the dividend Coppers
ere Intrinsically cheap, and whenever the
sharp breaks come would buy Copper Range,
Osceola. Michigan and Mohawk.
COTTONâ New York. May 23. â On good
cables our market opened firm, dx to ten
points up. There were, however, & eood many
orders In evidence, which carried prices eff
souse ten points. When theee were filled the
market ralJltd and was quite active. . In the
late trading the market turned very strong
and advanced to the high prices of the season,
with a flurry of buying- orders from New Or
leans, and ehort covering. We think It safe
to bay on Â«ill declines.

/ The Butchers' Union at its meeting last
night discussed the various unfair shops,
and one more ; shop was added to the
list. ..Charles Fritz's meat market, 3206
Mission street, between Twenty-eighth
and Twenty-ninth, was : declared unfair,
because he . has violated his agreement
with the union, it is alleged. .He| Is now
employing, only non-union" meat cutters.
The union will ask the San Francisco
Labor Council for a boycott on. this
market!
- It was reported that a circular has been
sent to local butchers by the Oakland
Butchers' Exchange, the- contents of
which are misleading. The ' union men
assert it cannot , be denied '.that wages

of indictment yesterday against Mark H Mor

K. BulgÂ».r have exonerated Captain F. Miller
and Chief Mate E. M. Peterson of the steamer
Sea ' Foam for eoUidms with the schooner Del
Norte on April 22. ,:" el
The members of the Grand Jury exam
ined were Charles W. Welch, Charles
McLane, Maurice Block. Isadore Zeller
bach, William Broderick, Milton H. Es
berg. August D. Hagedorn and Otto A.
Jungblutt.. Policeman H. H. Dobbin, who
was at that time attached to. the Grand
Jury, testified that he had'served a sub
pena on Rebstock. It had been Issued
frcftn the District Attorney's office, '.', but
was not signed by the District Attorney,
who was out of the city at the time." â¢
When the court opened yesterday morn
ing Attorney O'Grady said he would not
at present file any affidavits in regard to
the* alleged contempt -of \u25a0-. Fairfax H.
Wheelan in making noises with nls mouth
and shaking bis head on Monday after
noon in an alleged effort to impress the
jury with the idea that Fred Hancock,
a witness for the defense, was not tell
ing the truth. O'Grady said he would
wait till the conclusion of the trial and
then he might put several of the Jurors
on the stand to corroborate his allega
tion.
All of yesterday was occupied by the
defense in endeavoring to obtain testi
mony from members of the. Grand Jury
as to its proceedings leading up to the
finding of the indictment. The attorneys
succeeded in getting information that the
Grand Jury conducted an Investigation
as to alleged frauds at the Almshouse
precinct and the conduct of the election
officers, including the defendant. It was
also proved "that the defendant had been
summoned to testify and that he did
testify. Further than this Judge Lawlor
refused to allow any questions to be an
swered as to the nature of the testimony
or the proceedings before the i Grand
Jury.
At the conclusion of yesterday's pro
ceedings at the trial of Joseph Rebstock,
indicted for violation of the election law
as an officer of a primary. Judge Lawlor
ordered .the defendant into custody, much
to his surprise -and the surprise of his
attorneys. .-...He had been out on bonds.
.'The finance committee of the league,
William R. Wheeler chairman, held a
long session at headquarters last evening.
.The committee is composed of represent
ative business men of high character and
liberal views. Thcrt is not the slightest
.doubt of the committee's ability to raise
readily a sum of money sufficient to meet
;the legitimate expenses* of thorough or
ganization of good government forces In
every district of San Francisco.
- j Citizens who entertain the belief that
San Francisco has had enough of Ruef
.and Schmitz are asked to join the league.
The number of voters already enrolled ap
proximates 7000. â¢ When it is considered
!that district enrollment hae not begun,
:t3ae record is regarded as remarkable.
The Fortieth District was represented
by Jesse E. Marks, Edward Casey, John
T. Dare. H. F. Peart. Jonn F. Myrick.
Harry Diggrs. William Cobb, J. H. Dum
bell. William Gilchrist, L. Bettman. Sam
uel Logan. Fred B. Wood, P. J. Mehegan,
E. B. Read, E. J. Ensign, F. B. Kohl
b*Â»rg. Sanford Fllgenbaum, Lloyd Acker
rr.an, Frank J. Bauer, George Hare, Wil
liam Wilkinson and Edward Kelly.
Among the representatives of the For
ty-first District were Sheldon G. Kellogg,
Georse Walker. A. G. W. Dinkelspeil,
Charles A. Son, A. K. Daggett. P. C.
Rossi, Lester G. Burnett. Maxwell Mc-
Mutt, Nathan Coghlan, Dixwell Hewitt
and M. Josephsen.
The executive committee received en
couraging reports from both districts.
Assurances were given to the leaders of
the league that the sentitnent in favor
of good government was growing wider
and firmer. Regardless of individual views
touching municipal ownership of utilities,
Japanese exclusion, high license,- etc.; the
citizens and taxpayers insist on a clean
and capable administration of the affairs
of local government. It is suspected that
efforts may be made in certain quarters
to Introduce side issues to divert public
attention from the real question, but
Judging ' from -the expression of views
there is a firm and settled conviction that
San Francisco must have better local
government in order to achieve and main
tain prosperity.
Large delegations from the Fortieth and
Forty-first Assembly districts visited the
headquarters of the San Francisco Re
publican League, 536 Market street, last
evening. George D. Clark, president; D.
A. Ryan, secretary: John D. Daly, Fair

the effort of Judge Mogan to. get fairly
under way the: long-delayed jury triaii
of Atlee;F. Hunt, A. Hanson? and Jack-;
son Hatch Jr., art students, accused
of having severely injured: their class-i
mate, Albert T. D. Rome, by 'â¢hazing.,
him. In the first;, place a substitute
clerk of the court had .blundered; by '
summoning the ; seventy-five talesmen
to report at 9:30 - o'clock ' a. m.,/ which
was one hour earlier than* the . time the
case had been set ! for calling. In the
second' place a;. continuance^was asked
an the ground that Defendant Hunt was
ill and unable, to appear, but/ the Judge
decided .that the/ Impanelment iof the
Jury could not injure_Mr.' Hunt's inter
ests, as his attorney, \vas;presenL, Then
it.was reported that 'one-fourth ; of; the
men \u25a0 subpenaed to -serve / In the i "case

sought! excuse on t.*e: ground that' their

they 'were to \ abandon- it {evehl for an

clared that they were not citizens of

Judge Fritz, too, has announced in

riod in jail for any one 1 whom.; he pro
nounces guilty of befouling the atmos

more effectually deter the foul-tongued
