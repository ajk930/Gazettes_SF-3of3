secret organiza- )
tion and spread (
with great rapid
ltr over the en- 1
tire country and i
was for a long
time a most pow
erful factor . in
the affairs of the
workaday world.
It was- at all
times, however,
out of sympathy
with the Ideals of
the ' open trade
union and Its de-
The good .beginning thus made was
checked by the panic of 1S73 and for
lack of reserve funds many of these
unions died out during the long period
of depression. Various secret societies
took their places and held attention for
come time, but soon lost their influ
ence. The year 1872 saw the total dis
ruption of what was the first attempt
at a general trade union federation. It
was known as the National Labor Un
ion and its field was politics. It was
going to work Its reforms by first elect
ing a President, of .the United States.
It began in 1866 and. its life, therefore,
was six years. 1 Many other like move;
ments were started, but ran their
ccurse quickly. The Knights of Labor
was born in 1869 in Philadelphia, hav-
.nor statistics, and another protested
against the importation -of contract
laborers.
The American Federation of Labor
did r.ot spring Into existence over
night. Neither was It a sudden dis
Â¦ Â¦overy. It evolved In Jhe natural
course so that when the delegates from
ninety-five separate and distinct labor
organizations came together to'iorm
its first convention they had a knowl
edge gathered out of Ions experience
just what they wanted to do. That
their knowledge was sound and that
they built well out of it is now ap
parent. Trade unions had long exist
ed. The New York Society of Jour
neymen Shipwrights was incorporated
In 1SC3 â thirst regularly constituted
fn the United States. Unions of tailors
trades union of which there is record
:*.nd carpenters were organized in 1806
and hatters in 1819. In those days
lh<Â» work day extended from sunrise
t<Â» sunset and the members of those
unions knew why they needed to or
pnniz*-. Agitation began for a ten
hour day. and Martin Van Buren,
President of the United States by
proclamation in 1S40. fixed 'it so fo
all public w.orks. Not until 1S44,
however, was the 'day shortened to
the average workman, a long series of
strikes leading up ' fo it. To 'com
memorate the victory the shipwrights
had a bell cast and erected on the
river front at Fourth street, â¢ New
York, which for years rang out the
hour of beginiring and quitting work.
Unions were formed now. In every
manufacturing center, but until the
abolition of slavery they did not pass
beyond the stage of the isolated unions
oxeept in unimportant Instances. In
J&62 the first step in this direction was
made by the organization of .the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers
In Detroit. The National Cigarmak
ej s' Union quickly followed with head
quarters in New York. The Bricklay
ers' and Masons* International Union
was formed in'1864 and a number of
national unions came into being be
tween that and 1872.

during its session, not only. of the work
ers within trades unionism, but with
out, and not only th* workers of
America but the workers of the world.
The American Federation of Labor
had its beginning in Pittsburg '.3 1SS1.
John Jarrett, president of the Amal
gamated Association of Iron and Steel
Workers, oresided over a convention
held in Turner Hall November- 15 of
that year, at which ninety-six dele
prates were assembled, . representing
union workincraen to the number of
262,000. : An organization "was effected,
ihe object- of .which was the encour
.-.gement and formation of local,' city.,
national and international trades unions
and to secure legislation to the inter
ests of the industrial classes. Reso
lutions favoring certain reforms were
adopted at this initial session that
were shortly made into the !aw of the
land. One of these called for the es
tablishment of a national bureau of
It is, of course, the aim of the feder
ation to complete the circle.
If the growth of the movement con
tinues at the ratio of increase that has
marked its history for the past two
years the gap will be closed in less than
two years more, and every trades
union in America will have Its repre
sentatives at the gathering of the dele
gates In 1506 â wherever it be.
Reports of the executive officers to be
made in San Francisco concerning the
work of the order since its session in
Boston just twelve months ago will be
of the must inspiring character. Indeed
were the facts in these reports repre
sented in the black and white illustra

much smaller area. The federation is #
growing with such speed that it may

THE GROWTH OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR
OF the two million eight hundred
thousand workmen who Conn the
great army of trades unionism in
America more than two million
are affiliated with the American Feder
ation of Labor. The proportion of the
twoâ the army of the federation and the
lesser army of the unaffillatedâ -may be
presented by an Â«CacttvÂ» btt at black
end white Ulcft this.
; During the last few years the growth
of thV* organization has gone forward
by long bounds owing to the energetic
methods adopted for prosecuting . Its
propaganda, the general recognition of
its merits and the momentum acquired
by Its long and steadv progrress.
The "American Federation of Labor
is composed of constituent and repre
sentative bodies. Of the first are fed
eral labor unions, independent local
unions and international unions. The
second are central labor unions and
State branches.. Federal labor unions
are societies formed by wage earners
Â¦working at different trades and are
only established where there are not
enough workers at the several trades
to form separate unions.
Local unions having no International
unions of their crafts are composed of
members working at the same trade.
These are recognized and allowed to
affiliate only while there are as yet
too few unions of the trade to permit
the formation of a national union.
< The supreme power of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor is vested in
its convention. This is composed of
delegates, one or, more according to
its strength, from each national of
general union, the delegates having
one vote for each 100 members they
represent. Independent local unions
and federal unions are entitled to one
delegate regardless of the number of
their members. City central and State
bodies are also entitled to one dele
gate, having but one vote.
The American Federation of La
bor had affiliated to It May *, 1904,
118 international unions. These inter
national unions have complete jurisdic
tion over their own trades and have 23,
600 subordinate or local unions with an
aggregate membership exceeding 2,
000,000.. Besides the International unions
there were affiliated to the American
Federation of Labor 1501 local trade
unions and federal labor unions, 801
city central unions " and thirty-two
State federations.
The revenue of the American Feder
ation of Labor is derived mainly from
a tax levied on *each union, at the rate
of one-half of one per cent per month
from each member \ of international
unions, of 10 cents per month from each
member of local and federal unions
having no Internationals, and of a fixed
tax of $2 50 per quarter from each city
and State body. Of this, 5 cents of the
10 cents levied on members of federal
unions is applied to a defense fund.
The executive council has also the
power to levy assessments on all af
filiated unions to ' sustain unions en
gaged in "Industrial conflicts," the
levies not to exceed 1 cent per member
per week and for not more than ten
weeks in each year.
The reports for the first cJi months
of the fiscal year, October, 1903, to
March, 1904, show total receipts for
per capita tax of the federation were
$72,810 02. as against Â£51,188 15 for
the same months the previous year
shoving |the Increase in membership.
The session at San Francisco will be
the largest, most successful and alto
gether the most auspicious in the hla.
tory of the great unifying labor organ
ization.
At the sixth session, held at Colum
bus, Ohio, the title of the American
Federation of Labor was adopted, and
from which pojnt i the organization
dates the beginning' of an aggressive,
firm, onward march that has not ceas
ed since. At this session the iron mold
ers, .printers, granite cutter3, furniture
workers, miners, tailors, bakers, bar
bers, metal workers, carpenters and
cigar-makers joined the federation, and
together with several local and city
central unions swelled the ranks to a
membership of 316,469.
At the third session held at New
Tork City reports were made showing
the- ill success attending efforts made
by the federation to establish a modus
vlvendl with the Knights of Labor.
At Chicago, the fourth session, a res
olution to inaugurate a general agita
tion for an eight-hour workday was
adopted.
The fifth session was held In "Wash
ington, where the methods of the
Knights of Labor in organizing reject
ed, suspended and expelled members
and their imitation of trade marks and
labels of the trade unions were the
principal subjects of discussion.
Cleveland, Ohio. . This session waÂ»
marked by the indorsement of
& communication from P. J. Mo-
Oulre of the Brotherhood of
Carpenters, which declared the su
premacy of industrial over political
questions and at the same time defined
more precisely the scope of the feder
ation. It said:
"We favor this federation be
cause it Is the most natural assim
ilative form of bringing the trads
and labor -unions together. It pre
serves the industrial autonomy and
distinctive character ,of each trade
; and labor union, and, -without do
ing: violence to. their faith or tradi
tions, blends them all In one har
monious whole â a 'federation of
trade and labor unions.' Such a
body looks to the organization of
the working classes as workers, and
not as politicians. It makes the
qualities of a man as a worker tha
only test of fitness and sets up no
political or religious test of. mem
bership. It strives for the unifica
tion of all 'labor, not by ' straining'
at an enforced union of diverse
thought and widely separate meth
ods; not by prescribing a uniform
plan of organization, regardless of '
their experience or interests; not by
antagonizing or destroying existing â¢
organizations, but by preserving all
that is integral or goZd In them and
by widening their scope bo that
. each, without destroying their indi
vidual character, may act together
in all that concerns them."

"But â¢ the period . energetic enlist
ments'is^ over, for a time. The Ameri
can Federation of "Labor will now, I
believe, -turn -Its- energies -to -the work
of educating and disciplining the vast
army, of 1 its presehtVmembership, as
similating its new material, so to
speak.: Here Is now to- be- gained- its
great strength, the real strength of the
cause of- labor. Its members -are- to-be
taught how. to be effective. They know
what is soâ they. are to be taught why
it is so. The more perfectly, the work
ingrnan understands his .relationship
to his employer . the , more . loyal he .is
to' the only means by which he. can
hope to win in; a contest with his pow
erful antagonist. * I say antagonist, ' for
so long 'as human nature is human na
ture, capital and helpless - labor are at
war. "WelL as I was .saying, there .is
the very element of -strength and con
servatism in the position _of union la
bor. > It does not half blame. the capi :
talist for ; what he is. It recognizes his
position and the ignorance and preju
dice that he inherits by' right of his
having capital
just the same as
recognizes Its own
absolute necessity for fighting
for what it shall get. There
fore it goes about the work with
sanity and method, a sanity and
method that grow with experience
The American Federation of Labor cul
tivates strength through loyalty that
comes of intelligent understanding of
the situation and confidence ;in its
cause and in its leaders to exercise
conservatism." Conservatism is â¢ the
watchword of the American Federa
tion of Labor. By conservatism I mean
the disposition to demand only what is
fair and Just, to pres3 that demand
with temperance, arid in no case with
undue haste", to meet advances with
considerate justice and to proceed to
strike and other drastic measures only
when every other, means patiently em
ployed has not availed.
"The American Federation of Labor
has already, made ' great progress with
its cause by these principles.
"President Gompers has to his credit
the peaceful adjustment of a greater
number of disputes between labotv and
capital than any other one man. The
against an in- I
trenched privll- J
ege the strength â¢
of force must be used.
"The securing of right and justice
to one man "betters th# whole world.
Raise the level of an intelligence and
manhood of .the great mass of the peo
ple and the world will be a so much
better place to live in that men will
scarcely recognize it for the place that
it was; those that had "the best' there
was before will discover joys they
never dreamed of. When every man is
a res! man, carrying his head up with
ideas and knowledge in it, wearing
proper flesh on his bcnes and clothes
to cover It; when every woman,
through the means of . education, en
vironment and relief from overwork
and worry becomes a beautiful and in
telligent 'lady*; when children, all
children, may be properly cared for
and sent to school until they have ac
quired a good education, will not com
pensation have been rendered to ; the
privileged and pampered few for what
has been filched from them In the form
of their exclusive caste ? That Is the
whole story- That is i the end . toward
which the American Federation of .
Labor Is workingâ and 'working, now
with considerable speed. * What is the
- future?
"That is to. say, what is the "future
if the America n -Federation, of -Labor
proves to , be the perfected Implement
that we believe it to be. For these con
ditions are the same that all labor
movements have been directed at since
absolute chattel slavery .was wiped out
and men climbed to where they had a
horizon. If not, then the American
Federation of Labor will have at least
served to show the way, as others have
done before it. But we do know- that
the American Federation of Labor. Is
the best means to the end now, extant.
It has avoided the errors of other or
ganizations preceding it It has s the
same Working system as the Govern
ment of "the United States.. It is repre-
Â¦ and ; democratic . and avoids
entangling alliances. , It Is ruled by the
majority of its members. It Is. free ,in
its discussion of the problems it is try
ing to solve and it does, not fear pub
licity. And yet its goyernment . Is
strong and its laws are enforced to the
whole argument and weapon of the
American Federation of Labor is the
force of its number^ and the justice
of its cause. "With the first it would
excite the resr>ect of capital, and with
the latter enlist the sympathy of the
fair-minded. It will have nothing to
do with party politics. That is the rock
upon which many well intending move
ments split. Workingmen will vote
for their friends in whatever party
they find them, but no mandate ever
has gone or ever will go forth from
the officers or leaders of the movement
' to vote for any candidate. A great deal
has been made of a recent utterance cf
President Gompers about the effective
use of the ballot, but m most cases it
has been wholly misunderstood. Union
labor fully recognizes the power and
. effectiveness of the ballot, but its use
Is to be left to the intelligence of the
individual. He can choose his friends,'
he can enter politics as energetically
as he pleases and urge what candidate
he sees fit, bat as an organization the
American Federation of Labor will
have none of it. No principle ha3 been
more thoroughly threshed out and de
termined than this one.
"What are the reforms that union
labor is addressing itself to in its ef
fort to reach the good time coming,
and what means .are being employed?
In the first place il shoiild be noted
we have come a long way already.
The hours of labor have been reduced
from sunrise and sunset to ten and
then to eight hours; Chinese immigra
tion has been stopped, as also the im
portation of contract labor; the sweat
shop has been eliminated in large
measure and wages have been ad
vanced. That is worth while. . We
have undertaken to abolish child la
bor and will not cease until it is ac
complished and the child sent to
school. We would make government
by injunction impossible and rob a
Governor of the right to deport work
ingmen because he has the militia
with him. These are some of the
things we are working to accomplish.
We wish to secure the initiative and
referendum and we are diligently at
work in every State to that ecd. The
work is progressing excellently. The
Initiative and referendum once se
cured it will form an effective means
.toward other reforms.
"About the means to be employed?
Simply demand and agitation. "We have
11.000 district organizers subject to the
call of the American Federation of
Labor at all times and we
have thirty to fifty paid or
ganizers in the field all the time
preaching the gospel of unionism.
There on that big map on the wall you
will see their names, each on a little
slip fastened by a din at the location
at which he is working. These are
shifted as the men move and we can
thus survey the situation at a glance.
Each of these workers has his itiner
ary and is directed from this office.
As he leaves each town to go on to the
next he drops a card â a printed form he
fills out â and upon receipt of it here
we move his pin to the new location.,
The organizer does not devote himseLf
to any one craft, but undertakes to
â¢organize the town' before he leaves.
As a result of this activity wonders
have been worked- Many new crafts
have been recently and are being now
added to the great army of unionism.
Among these are the teamsters, who
a few years ago numbered bu,t a thou
sand or two, but who now have 85.000
union men. The waiters, which had but
700 seven years ago, now have over
50,000. Miners, carpenters and paint
ers have made phenomenal advances.
The miners now number 300,000,
the largest union; carpenters
167.000 and the painters 60,
000. These things account for the
great strides of the American Federa
tion of Labor, which in the last five
years increased Its membership 1,250.
000. Nearly every craft is now repre
sented in the federation.
"Our organizers are working all
over the United States, and in Porto
Rico and Hawaii.
"The jurisdiction, of the American
Federation of Labor extends over
North America, including Canada.
Canada is well organized, especially
Ontario, Quebec and the maritime
provinces. A union card is good any
where in these places. Indeed, the
union card of England is accepted
here. England is very well unionized
and they have a congress there that
is organized on lines similar to the
American Federation. Two delegates
attend the annual convention of the
American Federation of Labor and
two delegates from the latter attend
their annual meeting. Germany.
France, Austria and Russia are well
organized, but there'is-^no central body
there. They will be certain, however,
to follow the example that they see
works to such advantage with us. and
I look to see an intercontinental or
ganization of labor.
"But confining the question to the
United States I see a time, as the re
sult of our agitation and persistent
effort, when no child shall be set to
work, and children and youth shall go
to school until they are 13 years of
age; when every man's child shall
have the benefit of a high-school edu
tion; when men shall be so well paid
that they can afford to marry and rear
children and provide for them properly
and see to their education; when, be
cause of this, women will be taken out
of the field of ' competition by finding
husbands and homes; when every man
and woman will find time to loaf a lit
tle 'and invite his soul,* and life will
mean , something more than a day of
toil; when strikes and lockouts will no
longer be U3ed as a weapon between
employer and employed, because of a
mutual respect and a better under
standing. This 13 the' good time toward
which the American Federation of La
bor is looking and working, and I
think we shall see It in our day."
should have â that belongs to them by
right. They are at an immense dis
advantage because they are not only
without means, dependent upon* the
power they are attacking, but more
than all else they are inexperienced,
ignorant. They make mistakes and
are humiliated and their organizations
broken and scattered and they are in
dividually made to suffer ;vnd are re
duced to still more abject poverty. The
weaker among them are made weaker
and more timid still, but the naturally
strong are developed in strength and
grow in wisdom. They see wherein
the weakness of their former move
ment lay and they go among their fel
lows and point it out to them. They
see even as they did not see before
that only through uniting can they
ever be emancipated from their statti
of slavery- - [
'That is so fundamental a truth that
it is patent. No one disputes. Whejj
the non-union man frets at what 'he
calls the domination of the union he'
forms a union to oppose it This is
the amazing spectacle that this partic
ular brand of the spirit, of liberty has
reserved for modern eyes. Only by un
ion can headway be made by poverty
stricken individuals against the in
trenchments and fortifications of capi
tal. Organize, organize, organize. Or
ganize unions, unite these unions to
gether into other unions, and these
unions into still other unions, one in
trenched behind and reinforced by
the others; drill, discipline, educate
â educate every man to know his
rights and the rights as well as
the power of capital, to know
what to ask' for and what not
to ask for, to know when to ask, to
know when to substitute the word 'de
mand' for 'request.' and finally and
most vitally, to know how to enforce
that demand. That Is the American
Federation of Labor, tt is the great
est labor organization of the world.
"Tliey will tell you that the interests
cf labor and capital are identical, that
they should live together in peace and
harmony; the welfare cf one is the wel
fare of the other, and all that. Of
course it is. To the unbiased- this is
as fundamental as the truth of organi
zation- But the trouble is that capital,
like labor, is primarily ignorant â es
l>eciaUy is capital ignorant of this fact.
It can't be taught without demonstra
tion. It lacks the point of view and
no lesson is so hard to instill as that.
It is warm and well fed and it is labor
that makes It so. The more subservi
ent and the cheaper the labor on the
one hand, the more wealth and luxury,
on th-' other. How can the beneficiary
of such a condition understand that the
increase of wages, the reduction of the
hours of labor, the general uplift of his
employes. Is to his benefit? He cannot
see it To him this great truth must
remain forever obscure. How many
lives did it cost to cause the Southern
slave holder to forego his slaves. He
believed the institution was sanctioned
by the word of God. But is there one
v%ho will not confess that the world is
better for their release? There is the
v.hol* story. To secure a common right

"United they begin to devise
ways and means. They plan how they
ruay secure this and that that they
icnow. as men and not as slaves, they
timate, complete success of the mi/ve
ment is more assured by our being
thorough as we go along. The' work we
have to do is to educate. "Organize:
organize! organize!* is the slogan, but
organization is the first means toward
education. It is the class, thÂ« school.
It is the first essential. It is the first
impulse of the awakening mind. The
minute the working man realizes that
he is a man and not a slave he calls to
his fellows to unite with him for bet-

alone, but for that of the whole
working class; but even that fig
ure can be made to appear con
siderably smaller by reflecting upon
the length of time needed to organ
ize, say seven-eighths of the workers,
should subscription to the articles of a
political faith be made a condition of
membership in a trade union. '
Another material objection to the
plan of political action arises from
the attitude of the public toward labor
and politics respectively. Broadly
speaking It may be assumed that
the public favors the trade unions as
labor organizations and opposes them
as political clubs. In other words.
capacity for devotion, consequently, In
the one case as in the other, he re
sents the attempt, real . or imaginary,
to play upon his sympathies for labor
as a means of 'weaning him from
his chosen political faith.
When confronted' by such a situa
tion the average citizen may be de
pended upon to sacrifice his sympa
thies for the "rights of labor" in or
der to defend his own rights in the
matter of political belief. Public sym
pathy is a valuable and, indeed, a
necessary element ' in the work of
trade-unionism. Because of that fact
the trade union refuses to prejudice
Its case by committing Itself to a pol-
workers themselves, either inside or
outside of the trade unions, and the
public prejudice against any attempt
to carry a political point In the guise
of an appeal for laborâ that these
bases are approved by sound reason
ing cannot bÂ« gainsaid. That they
are also approved by practice may be
seen by comparing. the results achiev
ed by the so-called "pure" and simple"
trade ' union, with the experience of
"new unionism."
The results in the former case are
apparent on the face, of Industrial
conditions, in the increase of wages,
the reduction of hours and the mani
fold advantages enjoyed by the work-
â¢!â¢ and simple" meth
ods of trade 'unionism, find In thesi
methods the only means of escape from
the Ills that afflict them. ,
Apart from the ground of common
agreement among the great majority of
trade unionists ! upon the main Issue,
namely, the adoption by the trade
unions of a partisan political creed of
any kind, there exists a variety of
personal opinion regarding the merits
of the respective * party programmes,
methods of political organization out
side of the trade unions, and as to the
proper limitations of the Government
in respect to the relations between em
ployer and employe.
As to the first of these questions, the
Walter Slacarthnr, Editor Coast Seamen's Journal.
It Is begging the question to say that
the trade union depends entirely upon
thie strike and boycott to attain its
ends. Again, it Is begging the question
to say that the strike and the boycott
are failures to-day, or ever have been.
These measures are the last resort of
trade unionism, the only remaining
measures of protest when reason and
justice ; fail. Regarded as such, the
strike and boycott never fall, although
always to be deplored. The real vic
tories of trade unionism are won by
the forceâ the moral forceâ of organiza
tion, with Its corollaries of discussion,
conciliation and arbitration. And Just
as the trade unionist enlarges his
knowledge of his own affairs and in
creases his ability to manage these, so
he Increases his capacity and power la
the treatment of public affairs.
Trade unionism has its faults, of
course, but these are very largely the
faults of numbers, not of principles or
methods. We are not numerous enough.
that's the trouble. How to Increase
our numbers, that's the ever-present
problem. It is a problem that can only
be solved by adherence to first princi
ples. 1. e.. religious organization for re
ligious purposes, political organization
for political purposes, economic organi
zation for economic purposes.
Upon trade unionism tee workers
must depend for their hopes of future
progress. Anything that tends to
weaken that Institution must in the
final analysis be regarded as inimical
to the true Interests of the working
class.

The theorist mny plan an engineering
fenf which defies* nil tho (llfllcultlcs of

tion arises. Will th-Â» thing "go"?
Similarly, the theorist m:iy pnint a
house which is eminently natlafactory
â on canvas. The only trouble with
that kind of house is that you can't
live in It; you can only look u.t it. The
political theorist's scheme of regenera
tion is beautiful to look upon, a veri
table masterpiece of impressionistic
art; butâ -alas; those doubts â the ques
tion recurs, "W'ilk it "go"?
Of course, opposition to the plan of
political action by the tr de unions, as
such, does not of necessity imply any
objection to political action on tha
part of the working class, as such.
On the latter score opinions differ,
first upon the "class" issue; secondly,
upon the manner and extent of gov
ernmental regulation in economic af
fairs. Upon the former of these ques
tions the best opinion seems to be that
which Is expressed by the saying:
"The working class is the only clasa
that is not a class;* It is a nution." On
the latter point there is room for argu
ment between those who favor the
respective principles of government,
the paternalistic and the democratic.
However, there can be no doubt as to
which of these principles best repre
sents the American ideal. The politi
cal actionist in the American labor
movement is quite consistent in citing
the European workers as an exemplar,
just as the latter, In demanding gov
ernmental intervention In their indus
trial and domestic affairs, are con
sistent "with the principles and prac
tices of European government. And,
precisely because of this consistency
between political action and paternal-
Ism, the opponent of politic-, action
in the American labor movement i3
consistent with the principles and
practices of, American government, as
expressed by the maxim. "That gov
ernment is best which governs least."
Doubtless there are many ways In
which the methods of our Government
might.be corrected and its functions
extended with advantage to all the
people.
Possibly these ends can only be at
tained by some sort of readjustment
between the political parties. But
these are questions which only politi
cal organizations are capable of deal
ing with. To attempt to deal with
these questions In Â¦ the trade union
would be to destroy Its usefulness in
the economic- field without insuring any
compensating gain In the political field.
This point would be as tenable In a
state of complete trade union organi
zation as it is in the present state of
partial organization, since distrust and
dissension seem to be inseparable from
any form of political enterprise, as a
giance at the state of labor or reform
politics In any part of the world will
Immediately attest.
It is true to-day, and it probably al
ways will be true, that the power of the
Â¦workers to protect and advance their
welfare resides primarily and ultimate
ly in economic organization. To that
power the workers of the world owe
all that they now possess, not only in

Thus we find the three general objects
cf human desire to be (1) religious
equality, CZ) political equality, (3) in
dustrial equality.
Ancient history apprises us of the
struggles of soulless (I. e., slave) labor
fj>r equality in the sight of the gods.
Later records show us the struggles of
landless labor for equality before the
lawâ for political equality. The records
of to-day tell the story of the struggles
of .moneyless labor for equality on the
indnstrial field, for the establishment
of a system under which the moral
rights ot labor shall be recognized on
equality with the physical powers of
capital.
The philoeophy <of the sage, the vision
of the poet and the religion of Christi
anity have been realized. Religious and
political equality have been established.
Industrial equality, except to the ex
tent that it has been realized by and
through the trade union, is still a
philosophy and a vision, so far as the
theoretical reformer is concerned.
The moral of past events seems to be
that in the pursuit of these objects of
man's ambition separate and distinct
organizations are necessary; that suc
cess is achieved in proportion as the
identity of these organizations is main
tained, and delayed in proportion as
that identity is lost or merged.
Xo lesson of the past is more fami
liar than that of the struggle between
church and state, the essence of which
wa3 the desire for separation, and the
fruSp of which have been the strength
ening in all proper ways of both in
stitutions. The facts of to-day repeat
this lesson, in the need of maintain
ing the separation of the economic
and political movements, as a measure
in the interest of, and necessary to,
real and enduring progress in both
spheres of activity.
The comparatively slow growth of
the labor movement may be largely
accounted for by the failure of its
members to keep in view the real na
ture of that movement, and particu
larly to recognize the difference be
tween It and other movements. In
other words, the growth of the labor
movement has been" retarded by at
tempts to engraft upon it functions
peculiarly the property of other move
ments.
Consider another fundamental as
pect of the case. The spirit of com
bination for any purpose presupposes
mutual understanding and agreement
upon all material points. The un
derstanding among the members of a
grlven trade concerning the conditions
thereof and their agreement as to
methods of improving these constitute
the basic element of strength in the
trade union which confines itself to
purely economic effort, just as the dif
ference of opinion concerning political
questions constitutes the element of
weakness in the trade union which at
tempts to combine politics- and eco
nomics.
The adherence of the trade union to
purely economic lines of action con
serves its efficiency In a rwofold way;
It concentrates the thought and action
of those already in the union, and It
makes for the extension of organiza
tion among non-members.
It is a striking fact, one that the
proponents of "politics" in the union
should take due cognizance of, that
nothing so quickly alarms the average
man as the suspicion of politics in any
movement with which he may be
associated or with which he may be
asked to identify himself. The only
exception to this rule lies in the case
of these organizations which - are

FOR the past year we have heard
much of the open shop policy on
the part of employers. The
public as a rule know little of
what is meant by the so-called open
shop and wfth the approaching con
vention of the American Federation of
Labor to be held 'in San Francisco on
S'overnber 14 it Is very natural on
the part of the public and more than
likely employers of labor that the ques
tion of the open shop will receive more
or less consideration at the hands of
the delegates during their stay in San
Francisco.
The employer In setting forth his rea
sons for inaugurating the so-called
open shop attempts to convey the idea
that the unions are endeavoring to con
trol and dictate the policy by which
the employers should operate their va-
in a helpless and deplorable condition.
All the increases, all the reductions
in the hours of labor, all the protection
given to women and children in fac
tories, all the legislation inaugurated
In the various States and the national
Government looking toward the pro
tection of wage workers, has been
brought about, either directly or In
directly, by the trade unions of North
America and no matter what attempt
may be made by the employer to In
augurate his so-called open shop pol
icy, no matter what success he may
temporarily meet with In this direction,
organized labor is going to proceed
practically in the same lines in its en
deavor to secure still further improved
conditions of employment and if It Is
found that they can best be secured
through the policy of the closed shop,
the trade union movement will be
found fighting In that direction.
The open shop policy, therefore, on
tha part of the employers is, to my
mind, extremely foolish and will not
tend toward bringing employer, and em
ploye closer together, nor' will, it re-,
suit' in adjusting differences complained,
of by either side u'ndc- the present ixÂ»r
duatrial conditions. There -is but one"
way, to my mind, by which this can be
brought about and that is not by the
employer refusing the employes the
same right he asks for himself, namely,
to organize, but both sides should
thoroughly organize and recognize each
other as such. Then when questions
arise affecting either side, representa
tives should meet at the round table
and satisfactorily adjust such differ
ences and not, as is proposed Â»by the
employer, declare war upon the union.
JAMES G. O'CONNELL.
/~y LEABLT and distinctly, once
I I and for all, I desire to reaffirm
\7P my unalterable opposition to the
\ open shop. Its .tendency, as all
who have t studied the _ problem can
plainly see; is g to lower Â¦ wages v, and
lengthen* hours. For his own~protec-'
tion the workingman must Join hands
with his fellow worker and all stand
together firm and steadfast in a com
mon cause.
Â¦ The open shop means disunion, dis
organization and defeat. Too much at
tention cannot be paid to it. as It Is a
factor In our economical system
which must be brought out. plainly to
the attention of the workingmen. Their
homes and their means of earning a
livelihood are at stake.
Anything which will Interfere with
the good work now being carried on by
the labor unions is deleterious to the
best interests of the community. It
has been stated by the opponents of
union labor that San Francisco is a
union-ridden town. For the sake of
argument let us grant that assertion
and then see whether or not that fact
has tended to increase or decrease the
peace and prosperity of the city.
In the past two or three years wages
of workingmen were truly much higher
than before. Thelr^ condition has been
improved and when you improve the
condition of the wage earners of a
community you begin at the founda
tion for improving the conditions of
that entire community. It can safely
be stated that labor Is the basis
of a country's greatness and the wage
earner is the bulwark of her advance
ment and her prosperity. The only
logical conclusion Is that anything
which tends to benefit the wage earner
tends to benefit all the people. Re
member, the wage earning class is also
the distributing class. The more mon
ey a man on small salary has to spend
the more he will spend. On the other
hand those with large fortunes spend
about the same each year. In this
way the union promotes a greater dis
tribution cf coin which results to the
satisfaction of all.
The open shop would spoil this.
Given an opeix shop, what will become
of your .union, and to whom will the
toiler when wantonly wronged go for
assistance or redress? â¢ Show me a
place where high wages are paid and
I will show you a place where the peo
ple are peaceful, prosperous, contented
and happy. There are at least 43.000
union men in this citv. Now. roujrhly
The reason given by employers may<S

ture will refuse to meet the represents- ,
tives of organized labor or treat Â¦with

era; thus the very mea who are at-<
teirpting to inaugurate the open shop<
are denying to their employes the j
eanse right they have taken to them
selves of forming an association. 1
whether the association be called &\
labor organization or an employers' \
association. {
The employers* associations through
out North America have attempted toj
Induce their employes to form various \
kinds of associations among them-(
selves and they (the employers) be- (
conie part of such associations with a (
view to dictating what lines shall be
followed and outlining the policy. to y
that the so-called association shall be (
directly under the control of the em-|
ployer. This attempt to form associa-
lions of wage workers on the part of
the etr.ployer has proven a direct fall-^
ure, and while there are^ at the present \
time remnants of a few labor orga.nl- {
rations formed by the employers, the.
employes are rapidly realizing that'
they have been and are now being used '
Eimply as tools In the inauguration of {
a eystem that in time would find them (
r CTy HE coming together on the pan
} I of men or women of one trade
) | or calling for the purpose of con
) JL suiting with and assisting each
l other on questions relating to their
dally workâ the rules under which it
Is done or to be done and the wages
and hours relating thereto, is called a
"trade union." Consciously or uncon
sciously. It is in obedience to the com
mand "Bear ye each other's burdens-"
When men or women working together
for one or more employers feel that
they are not getting a fair share from
the product of their labor â that the
wages are too low, the hours too long
or the shop rules burdensome beyond
what is necessary, it is natural that
they should seek advice from each
other â that they try to remedy the
wrongs 'under which they feel them
i selves to be living, and very naturally,
having the same Interests, they en
deavor to make common cause.
Meeting somewhere quietly they se
lect 6ome of their most trusted fellows
to lay the grievances before the em
ployer in the form of a petition. -In
this they exercise In the Industrial field
their right of audience and petition
leng ago granted to them as citizens of
the United States.
The seamen of this coast, feeling
deeply aggrieved under the conditions
they had labored on board and lived
on Bhore, came together 'on the 6th of
March, 1S85. for the purpose of devising
ways and means to remedy the griev
ances under which they lived.
Among the grievances may be enum
erated tlfat under section 4553 of the
Revised Statutes of the United States
they were considered and treated as
part of the property of the ship. They
might be. sent to prison for an unlim
ited time at the will of the master, if
he. in his opinion, had reasons to be
lieve that they were going to quit em
ployment "with him and seek employ
( ment elsewhere.
rt Under section 4598 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States if they
had withdrawn themselves from ser
vice to which they had previously
agreed they could be advertised for,
a premium put upon their arrest and
return to their owners in the same way
as a negro slave prior to the war or
as a criminal who had broken out of
state's prison, as a runaway slave or
an escaped criminal, and were arrested
wherever found without warrant and
without any legal process â taken as
other property is taken by the owner
wherever he finds it and brought back
to the owner's safe possession.
Under section 4601 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States, any one
who should harbor or secrete such
runaway seaman was committing a
misdemeanor and was subject to a
fineâ one-half of which went to the in
former. On return to their master
they might be and were subjected to
corporal punishment (other than flog
ging) and could be deprived .of food,
except bread and water, until they were
willing to continue to labor in a man
ner satisfactory to their master.
Certain clothing Is absolutely neces
sary at sea. It is as necessary to the
seaman as the mechanic's tools are to
the mechanic the lawyer's library to
the lawyer, the surgeon's tools to the
surgeon or the machine to the type
writer, yet the seaman's clothing
might be and was held for debt while
he was sent to sea or turned out into
the street with nothing but what he
had on.
If any other man was In debt, and an
execution was levied against him, the
law exempted some things which were
considered the Immediate necessities of
life, and when the person In question
was working for monthly wages or
dally wages the law ? exempted from
execution the last month's pay or the
last week's pay so that the person in
question might have something to buy
a meal of victuals or a bed upon which
to sleep of a night. No such exemp
tion was made in reference to the sea-
man. Said law authorized the taking
from him by attachment or by gar
nishment and execution every cent he
had earned within the last two or three
months, as the case might be.
The admiralty law prohibited the at
tachment of the seaman's wages, but
the creditor went to the State court,
had the wages attached and through
State machinery took it alt and left
the seaman stripped, so that he was â¢
unable to pay for a night's lodging or
a meal. In this condition he was com
pelled to mortgage hi3 body and its
labor power in order to live.
The esteem in which the 'seaman was
held is best illustrated by a report
made in the month of January, 18S7, by
a charitable society in this city when
they said, "We have during the year
done excellent work among criminals,
prostitutes and sailors."
Â¦ There were some organizations, such
as ,the Seamen's Friend Society, who
at least ostensibly were organized to
aid and protect the seaman, but the
conditions under which it lived, the
conditions under which the seaman
lived and the status of our law were
such that Its work was more of a curse
than a blessing. Such was the condi
tion of the seamen when they met and
determined that they would become
part of the great army of organized
labor; that tl*y would depend on them
selves to change conditions; that, come
what may, they would bear It no longer.
Through their organization as a trade
union the seamen have appealed to
their fellow workmen on shore and
afloat, to reformers, lawmakers, friend
ly societies, the clergy and humanita
rians wherever found for helpâ not In
thje shape of money, not as beggars
seeking alms, but aa human beings, Â«
feeling themselves to be such, feeling
themselves to be equal to other human
beings, and by virtue of their human
ity claiming as their due such chengea
In their daily life and such changes in
the law as would give to them an op
portunity to prove that they were and
are the equals of other men. ,
In the eighteen or nineteen years in
which they ha've been organised and
worked as a trade union for their own
protection and improvement of others,
their best ability have assisted in the
protection ar.d improvement of others,
they have suffered untold hardships, at
times felt the bitterness of defeat, but
also the joys of victory on other occa
' sions.
No one now would make a report
such as the one mentioned above; no
one now would consider a man an in
ferior simply because he had chosen as
his life calling the sea.
As far as the ports in the United
States, In the British ; possessions of
North America, in the West Indies and
in Mexico are concerned, the seaman
to-day is as free to quit emploj'ment as
any other man. Of the seamen sailing
oa short voyages, it may be said that
letters of manumission have been is
sued to them, but If the seaman under
takes to exercise his natural rightâ his
inalienable right under the Federal law
of the United States â to the ownership
of his own body, he may in the port of
foreign countries still be treated as a
runaway slave or an escaped criminal.
' Trade unionism has done much for
the seaman in the last nineteen years.
Much yet remains to be done, and on
this occasion and through this paper
they appeal to all believers in human
freedomâ in human equalityâ in human
Justiceâ to give their assistance, in so
far as they can. to the work yet to be
done, to the end that. the seaman may
be given the same rights, and so far as
his calling pel-mlts, as are given to
other men under the American flag.'
The seamen realize that the coming
-together and the meeting of the intelli
gence of all and making that bear
upon and redress the wrongs and suf
ferings of all is unionism â is a school
in self government, in self control. In
self abnegationâ yet also In the exer
cise of their natural right so neces
sary to a successful social and indus
trial life of to-day.
if these were able to secure
Â£an advance of say SO cents a day or
can average of say $2000 a day or $500,000
va month, of course all this would not
be spent wantonly or carelessly, but a
great, portion of it would so for the
purchase and beautlfication of homes.
The workingman Is a medium of cir
culation. With him the luxuries of yes
terday have become the necessities of
''to-day. His union aids him in obtain
ing these luxuries. Standing alone or
on the open shop basis he must auction
oft his ski!!, his brain and his muscle
to the highest bidder. With his union
there is a minimum set and he 'will not
work below it. This minimum is a llv-'
Ing wage, regulated to provide a man
with the common necessities of life and
some of its luxuries.
The open shop is its direct antithesis.
They are as widely separated as the
poles. There is one remedy to break
down the open shop â the co-operative
store will do it. These co-operative
stores have been established extensive
ly throughout the East, and thty are
gradually growing in strength and fa
vor in this city. During 1 the past year
several have been opened, and I expect
to see more in the near future. My idea
on this line Is for men to band them
selves together, as they did recently
here In a shoe house, each put up for a
certain amount of stock and elect a
manager from among their number, the
manager to hold office so long as he
conducts matters satisfactorily. In this
manner I think the open shop can suc
cessfully be fought and made a thing
of the past.
Let the workingmen. Instead of Idly
talking, open a rival shop, no matter
what the business of the concern raay
be. make it more attractive, each take
a little stock in the concern, and see
what will happen to the establishment
which locked them out
Strikes are always to be deplored and
are always expensive. The money
spent in strike benefits .will frequently
pay for the opening of a rival estab
lishment, which will put the other man
out of business quicker than anything
else and will also provide employment
for many men.
I have repeatedly said, .and I have
always consistently endeavored to
live up to the declaration, that capital
and labor, employer and employe,
should have equal consideration and
equal protection; that capital must
have safe and steady investment tn
order that labor may have constant
' and remunerative employment; that
< the interests of both are for a con
, servative and friendly recognition by
each of the rights of the other, and
1 under all circumstances and condf
, tions I propose to abide and to ef
fectuate these ideas.

TRADES UNIONISM AMONG SEAMEN

GROWTH OF THE BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS
President^ of Sail Frai^clscÂ©
President of California Biuild
m&' Trades Cotir&cil
IX 1894. following the, stringency in
the money market throughout tha
world and its consequent influence
and effect upon all financial tran
sactions, the restriction of trade, the In
crease of interest, the decline in value
of securities and the paralysis in busi
ness generally, the condition of the
building industry in this city and coun
ty owing to the lack of organization
was in a chaotic state, and such that
employer and employe endeavoring to
conduct their business in a legitimate
manner realised the necesritv of bring
ing about an organization, to the end
that it might In the future be managed
in a manner indicative of success to
the owner,; the architect, the builder
and the workman alike.
There was no established system for
the conduct of building operations, no
stability as to the status of contractor
or journeyman, no fixed rules so neces
sary for -the protection of the owner,
contractor or workman. Prices of labor
and materials were of a shifting char
ncter and subject to so much change
that contracts were menaced and the
contractor and workmen were involved
in continual doubt as to ultimate re
sults of anything undertaken. Work
men were undercutting workmen; con
tractors were, underbidding contractors
and basing their competition upon di
minished prices for labor. These cir
cumstances invited to the building in
dustry unscrupulous persons, who
would undertake anything and every
thing in competition with well-known
and established contractors and rely
upon the open market for materials and
labor, taking chances upon success or
failure, as fortune might determine.
In this manner the building Industry
of this city- had received, because of
the manner in which it was conducted,
a severe and serious setback. Property
owners and investors, feeling in a meas
ure disgusted with the unsatisfactory
and unstable condition of things ob
taining, ceased building in a measure
alarming within itself.
At this time the artisans engaged in
the building business, who were prin
cipally old residents and property own
ers of the city, who were dissatisfied'
with the changeable conditions, orga
nized the Building Trades Council of
San Francisco. Beginning with a few
unions, they drafted a constitution and
by-laws setting forth the aims and ob
jects of the organization. Immediately,
by all those engaged in the building
Industry who obtained a livelihood from
the same, was' the influence of such an
institution recognized, and that so
ilearly that the Building Trades Coun
cil grew both in influence and strength
numerically, until it is to-day. one of
the greatest and most successful cen
tral bodies engaged in the building in
dustry in the world, bringing to the
owner, architect, builder and employe
alike assurances of stability of charac
ter witnessed in no other part of the
world.
The constitution and by-laws of the
Building Trades Council originally
adopted have . undergone many
changes, said changes being "necessary
U< the government of a. body continu
ally expanding and increasing in prom
inence" and importance, as well as to
the further stability if the industry,
the management of which, from the
Journeymen's side or interest,' required
protection.
In framing the constitution and by
laws and ia making the amendments
necessitated and suggested by its
growth and expansion, the Building
Trades Council has used every endeav
or to act strictly within the letter of
the law; respecting the constitutional
rights of all persons; frowning upon
the encroachment of personal right
and security; and steadfastly and' de;
terminedly asserting, the legal rights
of Its constituent members and organ
izations.
The effectiveness, reasonableness and
practicability of the organic law of the
Building Trades Council and the sys
tem by which its business is conducted
tinder that law are best evidenced by
its unqualified and enduring success.
The Building Trades Council is made
up of delegates according to propor
tional representation. The executive
board of the coundl Is also made up
on the lines of proportional represen
tation. Through the council and Its
executive : board, to the exclusion of
other systems in vogue throughout
the country, such as boards of business
agents and otherwise, is the business
of the Building Trades Council done,
â¢very matter, regardless of Â¦ how triv
ial it may be, having to be first attend
ed to by the Council, Its executive
board or its executive officers, before
being finally decided upon, and then
said business is, in the field of oper
ations, dealt with in accordance with
instructions by the representatives of
the Building Trades Council, known as
its business agents.
The work of the council in relation to
its affiliated membership and with the
employer has been conducted with a
view to extending to all strict justice
consistently with the rights of owner,
contractor and Journeyman. The prin
cipal aim of the council is now and al
ways has been to establish a fixed and
unchangeable system in the building
business tending to the absolute secur
ity of the contracts, integrity of Inter
course and stability of conduct for; the
mutual protection of all concerned, to
the end that the owner feels absolutely
safe in improving his property, - the
contractor is protected against changes
after a contract Â¦ is signed, and the
journeyman is guaranteed his hours
and wages and the responsibility of his
employer.
TJje duties of the business agents are
to carry,, out the- instructions '.of the
Council, and not, as found . in . other
localities of our country, as their own
ideas may. dictate. Nothing is left to
the discretion of the business agents.
Their duties are ministerial and not
executive. There Is but one fountain
head and all instructions, rules and or
ders emanate from that head. The
Council conducts its affairs directly;
grievances are redressed by it and the
sphere of the business agent is limited
to carrying out the expressed will of
the Council. It is a matter of pride j
and felicity that while in other cities
the business agent , has -been the sub
ject of scandal and notoriety, the first
instance ia. yet to arise, in this city
wherein the business agent has proven [
false to his trust between employer arid
Council.
In other words, the. business agents of
the Building Trades Council of San :
Francisco are to see to it that the in
structions given them by the unions
through their representatives in coun
cil meeting assembled are carried out .
in a just and equitable manner, as .
well as in a manner- benefiting the posi
tion occupied' by the building industry
of our city. ','Â¦"' Â»':''Â£.â¢Â¦Â¦'' : i'
Because of the good work accom
plished by the Building Trades Council
of San Francisco It became apparent
during the year 1900 that In order to
protect the legitimate Â¦ contractor as
i well | as the . interests of the owner,
architect and mechanic' alike if. was
necessary to organize in the other
business, centers of our State, councils
such as the San j Francisco Building
Trades Council. Hence the work was
taken up ' by the : San â¢ Francisco Build-
The WORK of the EAST YEAR in SAN FRANCISC0
THE past year has been one of the
most important in the history. of
the labor movement in San Fran
cisco. There has not been the
hurrahing of the fungus-growth, un
stable unions, born to foster the pri
vate ambitions of a few and then die
down in a night, but there has been
solid, substantial v.ork accomplished.
A structure has been reared to stand.
Common sense is its foundation and the
materials used are good, cool, deliber
ative judgment and careful business
management. .
Without going directly into a. dry
routine of statistics and interminable
figures, 1 the casual, thoughtful observer
will- readily see that much has been
done to improve the conditions of the
toilersâ the men whose brains, brawn
and muscle, allied with capital, make
this great country what it is/ Â¦
: Strikes have been few during the past
year and these have in the main been
confined^ to the younger unions in the
less skilled branches. Among, the work
irigmen generally there is a spirit of
security and a desire f of ' Industrial
peace.- Petty disputes are being settled
without resort to .radical- meansâdis
putesin days even when unions did not
exist would cause the more hot-headed
ones to urge the others to walk out.'
Strikes during; the year, so far as
the public at large is concerned, were
very rare. .Trouble was threatened. by
the .carman,, but. averted after' both
sides had been heard and the matter
left 'with a referee; . the, linemen after
a" short strike returned to work with
an increased of wages; and the bunion
still intact; the strike â¢ of . the brewers
lasted but; two days/and the bakers
won their demand , for ..higher ,wages
without going out at all.
There have been numerous other dis
turbances, but : ; none '_ affecting , more
than a few people. The i outlook is . for
a : quiet and prosperous year. To quote
Secretary - Wisler of the * San : Francisco
Labor Council, which represents thou
sands of men in the labor movement:
"You ask me for something regard
ing the year last past. I will say it
was one of our most prosperous. Sta
bility has-been our watchword and
much has been accomplished. We have
had few. battles and in those few have
practically come out victorious.
"Employer and- employe are coming
closer together. The union is bringing
about a . better understanding and is
helping educate the men to a higher
standard.- There is little dissatisfac
tion and little grumbling -from either
side.
"There were few unions organized
during the - p,\st year, it Is true, but
on the other. hand it -must be remem
bered-that trades and occupations are
at present â¢: quite thoroughly . organized.
Â¦ "In membership the ; unions are hold
ings their own .or, better, for there has
been. -an /increase. Another healthy
feature is the fact that the majority of
the men who > come, here from other
cities carry working cards with' them.
"We have had little difficulty with what
is commonly termed 'scabs,' as the men
who come here without cards are, as a
rule, willing to Join the union. Easy
terms are made for them if finances
are low and all seem Well contented.
"Of course we expect more or less
trouble from the. Citizens' Alliance," .but
as yet It has ! done no serious injury
nor do I think it will so long as em
ployer and employe . can be made to
understand each other.
"The unions; are on the whole in a
prosperous condition. We can ; look
back on the year, last past and feel
that should the next be as full, both
of promise and fulfillment, we are ad
vancing toward a long-desired goal
slowly but steadily. The absence of
wildcat movements and fire-brand agi
tation is a healthy sign. The freedom
fromdlsastrous strikes is another. We
are working earnestly- and hope to
make life . easier and conditions gen
erally, better, for ourselvesâ the work
ing men and working .women."

P. II. McCarthy, President San Francisco and California Buildins: Trades Councils.
> ing Trades Council and councils organ
ized in several business centers of Cal
ifornia and a, State convention callec
on December 16, 1301. when the organ
ization of a State Building Trade:
Council was perfected.
The objects of the State Buildinj
Trades Council of California are:
Firstâ To promote In a legitlmat<
manner the building industry through
out the State.
Secondâ To bring about as nearly a:
possible uniformity regarding the man
ner in which the building industry ma]
be conducted.
Third â To protect from the on
elaughts of the unscrupulous and de
signing contractor hereinbefore men
tioned, the legitimate contractor, at
Â¦well as owner, . architect and mechani<
alike.
Fourth â In case of need to be in ' j
position to draw from the other cen
ters of our country, through the Statt
Building Trades Council, mechanic:
necessary to the conduct of the build
ing business throughout the State, as
sisting the builders of out State suet
as they have never been assisted in an:
other part of the world.
During the life of the Buildinj
Trades Council of this city and Stat*
many important events have takei
place in the building industry and ii
all instances has the Building Trade:
Council placed its business. whei
necessary to a complete and equltablt
adjustment of the same, in the hand:
of the mpst responsible bodies, madi
up of mercantile and professional in
terests, | within the boundary lines o
our State, and nation.
This course has been suggested bj
the fact that the constituent member:
of the unions affiliated with the Build
ing Trades Council are among the fac
tors which comprise this common
wealth. Their property interests ar<
here; their families are maintainec
here; their taxes contribute to th<
maintenance of our municipal anc
State system. In short, their interests
are identical with those cf all othei
citizens and the same influences whict
affect one affect all.
..In 1900 one of* the most notable in
stances of this kind occurred in thÂ«
controversy then existing between the
manufacturers engaged in the building
business and the operators or employes
of the same. During that controversj
many meetings were held, many : dis
cussions were had regarding the same
by large and representative bodies, and
the Building Trades Council of Sar
Francisco, in response to a request, the
parallel of which was never agreed tc
before, acquiesced and unanimously de
cided to refer the entire subject mattei
to the Merchants' Association of Ham
Francisco, an association embracing
some thirteen or fourteen hundred em
ployers, for settlement.
This was such a great departure
from the old methods employed in the
conduct of labor organizations that the
community was, for a time, dumfound
ed and the employers in question,
largely represented in the Merchants'
Association, refused to acquiesce to the
request of the Builders' Association to
refer their side of the controversy to
the said Merchants' Association for ar
bitration.
The difficulty then existing was, after
several months, arbitrated by men
having the interests of our city and
State at heart, who, imbued with a
spirit of fairness and impartiality to
labor and capital alike, adjusted once
and for all this most grave and serious
trouble. Time has established the fact
that relief sought by the Building
Trades Council and the result of the
settlement In line with its contentions
has been of inestimable benefit to all
interested.
Again, the Building Trades Council
was in a like measure confronted with
serious difficulty through the Â¦ Master
Painters of the Pacific Coast, in behalf
of the painters affiliated with the
Building Trades Council, and again the
Building Trades Council decided to re
fer the entire subject matter for ad
justment to the same or a similar body,
believing as it did that such an insti
tution had but the best interests of the
city and State at heart.
This action, unlike the other contro
versy, . brought the trouble to. a close,
for the Master Painters of the Pacific
Coast and the representatives of tha
Building Trades Council met and ad
justed speedily the existing contro
versy.
Hundreds of .other instances of less
importance to the building business
may be cited, but suffice to. say that,
due - to - the manner In which, as well
as the conditions under which, and the
channels through which, the Building
Trades Council of this city and State
has .conducted Its business, in so far as
the, journeyman engaged in the build
ing business may be concerned, the
building industry has received an
Impetus far beyond anything ever
dreamed of by the most careful stu
dent of the commercial or industrial
world,. with the result that San Fran
cisco, as well as the' other cities in
California are freer from entangling
alliances, disasters - or misunderstand
ings in the building business than any
other cities In our Union.
;It [Is the earnest wish of the writer
that such a condition of things main
tain to the end that California may
reach a stage In the history of our
State surpassing any other State In tha
[tnion, as well as bringing to the front
tier commercial and industrial enter
prises in a manner indicative of suc
cess, - and as It is in this instance, so
It is in all other departments of labor,
the earnest nvlsh and prayer of the
undersigned that employer and em
ploye alike may see the wisdom of
leasing, to quarrel and attend to the
building up of our State in a manner
:nfHf>ntiv*Â» of 1 cm^^,,cause some of the work bearing the
emblem is not. perhaps, as fine as
other. Evtn if the objection were true,
our friends of the opposition would
just as vigorously assail us were the
men or women responsible refused ad
mittance to the organization repre
sented by the label. Either way we
are wrong! The trade union and the
label are one and the same .thing.
Both stand -for- the . same principles.
Granting that unionism is in error as
an institution, that the shortened
hours; Increased wages and their con
comitant advantages are a delusion,
we will admit that the union label
has deceived us. But the reverse is
the case. The Isbel is the silent fac
tor in settling industrial troubles.
It helps its friends to purchase goods
manufactured under known condi
tions in preference to those produced
under circumstances unknown. The
selfish man argues that so long as
the article is satisfactory no ef
fort -should be made to penetrate into
its make. But that is not his Sun
day argument. We may hear him tell
on -that day of the "brotherhood of
man," and the necessity of "bearing
one another's burdens.â¢ and "doing
unto others as we would be done by"
â all good doctrines and true, but
equally as applicable to Monday's pur
chase as it is to Sunday's prayer. The
union label is like all other human
devised methodsâ not perfect â but it
needs to be superseded by a better
plan before the thinking: citizen
would care to see it abandoned.
The trade union enables the fair em
ployerâwho, iike the fair unionist, pre
dominatesâto estimate his labor on a
living basis. .This system is a good
deal preferable to figuring on what his
unfair competitor can procure his
cheapest help for. - Not only that, but
it is a protection for the merchant. It
enables the trade unionist to live as
becomes an American citizen, and has
a powerful -influence in procuring fair
compensation for the individual whose
conscience will not permit him to. Join
any combination in this free
petitive age. Again, the union head
quarters act as , a clearing-house for
the employer. It is convenient to send
there for additional help.
The trade union is not flawless by
any means. It Is a <*ood deal easier to
tear down than, to build up. but thÂ«
latter 'course applied with intelligence
to the labor, movement will overcome?
many of its deficiencies. The gains'are
greater than, the losses. While the
dominant trait of human nature is
selfishness. Just so long will we find
both sides endeavoring to get the best
of the industrial situation. The trad*
union has come to stay. It is a natural
outgrowth of present-day conditions.
wages, v long hours and unsanitary con
ditions possess no attraction for the
normal u man. The . "open shop" advo
cates are not altogether influenced by
love of mankind in their contentions.
If consistent, wouldn't these gentlemen
favor the abolition of the trade .re
straint everywhere visible? The mer
ger, combination, trust, carcl rate, cut
ting off of supplies, and general denial
of business opportunity are evidences
acknowledged' on all hands of the
"closed shop"- In its worst aspect. To
use 'that term to the trade union alive
to the labor movement is erroneous.
In the latter case it should be "union
shop," for men k are welcomed to its
ranks. There are two aides to the
"open shop" controversy., One is the
danger of trade ; unionism losing i^s
civilizing power as detailed in this
article â securing in return not even the
shadow] for the substance-rand the In
consistency of > men ' claiming "open
shop" as "a good ihingâ for the other
fellow," as Mark Twain . puts it.
In New York City there; is an asso
ciation connected with the labor move
ment that gives evidence of a live spirit
in dealing with the â problem. Refer
ence is made to the Church Association
for the Advancement of the Interests
of Labor- It Is part of the machinery
of the Episcopal Church. One of the
strongest supporters -, is Bishop H. C.
Potter. The â¢ movement ?- has spread to
other cities, and the Bishops of all the
States are among : Its - officers. Atten
tion was first called to the necessity, of
this society by,^ the earnest efforts ot
men and women to organize the gar
ment workers and thio.se connected with
the textile trades in order. to relieve the
monotony of, their r existence ' and En
deavor to combat the thraHdom of the
sweatshop and the .â¢ tenement house.
Women, af the fashionable -world vere
of justice is toward a higher plane.
The man who slugs is less an enemy
of the republic than the man who
placÂ»s iron in a life preserver, for. his
enmity to the true conception of union
ism is both crude and repulsive. One
of the highest non-union authorities In
the country states that all the crimes
alleged to have been committed in
Colorado pale into insignificance beside
the record of the shipbuilding trust..
The majority of men rare honest. A
larger conception of the varied Inter
ests' making up the whole of the ever
present industrial controversy is need
ed.. We will have to return to first
principles. Certainly no policy of ex
termination under the guise of Ameri
canism will" have a lasting effects The
unions may be weakened, but they will
certainly gain strength afterward, for
history, repeats itself.- The worker
knows no power other . than his or
ganization to secure and; hold the ad
vantages of his present position. In
stances of Increased hours and lowered
wages are chronicled In the columns of
the press where the emasculation of the
union is either partial or, complete. And
who Is the gainer?
The trade union has an educative in
fluence. The London dock workers
were elevated in .every, wsy by .the
revelation of their miserable condition
before organizing. The opportunities
for public speaking, are 'many.,.. A' man
must be *more or Jess -. of a 'student' to
keep apace with â¢ the times. Technical
schools are supported In some > of the
trades, especially in -European- coun
tries, and every Influence . exerted on
behalf of those willing to improve
themselves. ' .
Need It be wohdered'jthat the work
era show strong' opposition to any
threatened return of former conditions?
Seven- days' labor In one week, " low
What reasonable objection can there
be to the use of a label standinc for
such a type of citizenship? Surely, any
"arbitrary" action on the part of some
organization should not * be considered
good ground for destroying the potency
of an emblem that has the support of
reform agencies. We are criticized be-
A subject of controversy is the or
ganizing of unskilled occupations.
Many men admit that skilled labor has
always had the union in some form and
s re not adverse to the idea, but objec
tion is raised to those without trades
combining. When pressed for reasons
the replies verge on the vague. Grant
ing that the sudden injection of this
class of labor into industrial disputes
is not I unattended by problems, owing
to lack of experience and new-found
power, yet the teamster has exactly the
same right to organize as the master
arayman. In this city we find his
hours, wages and general conditions
greatly improved. The same could be
said of other lines of business. .The
employer has his union. The employe
has his.
One of the most important agencies
in making the trade union a civilizing
factor Is the union labeL It is becom
ing the custom to hire purchasable men
to combat .its influence, to circulate
printed matter describing it as a
"badge of servitude," and to generally
predict desolation should its power in
crease. The superiority of non-union
over union ethics is not apparent to
those who have worked under both sys
tems as wage earners. The union label
first stood for American labor in
America, as opposed to Asiatic. It still
does. It shows that the producer par
ticipated in the work of preparing the
finished article under conditions that
were sanitary and fair [ and that he
was paid a living wage for his labor.
addressed in their homes by members
of the C. A. I. L., and the condition
of those who made their highpriced
garments explained at length. The re
sult was that energetic steps were
taken by the society leaders to aid
their less fortunate slaters by requir
ing the presence of the union label on
all goods manufactured for them. The
idea took hold. A lady organizer is
kept in the field by the Episcopal
Church. Every attempt is made to
smooth over labor difficulties and ad
vise for the general good. The trade
union has proved a valuable ally for
the protection of the women who work.
It is antagonistic to the influences that
mar human life in our large cities.
And the society women are not paying
more for their garments. If some
other panacea will do for these work
ers Â¦ what the union label has, let us
hear of it.
The concentration of men in organi
zations needs the counterbalance of
conservatism. That this has not al
ways^ been the case with the labor
movement is admitted, but the ; ten
dency born of experience and the spirit
While this endeavor to fulfill the
humanitarian, obligation of the labor
movement -is in its Infancy, yet it
would be pertinent here to refer to the
splendid institution maintained at Col
orado' Springs by the International
Typographical Union of North Amer
ica. At a cost of over $100,000 a build
ing complete as a home for deserving
printers has been erected. Its appoint
ments are perfect. A hospital annex
is devoted to the sick and the medical
and nursing departments are equal to
the best- This Union Printers' Home
is supported by printers contributing
a small sum of ntoney each month. It
is in no sense a charitable (institution,
for its Inmates have done their share
toward paying the cost. At the dedica
tion of the home on May 12, 1892, the
officials of the organization were assist
ed by Senator Jacob H. Galllnger, Gov
ernor Routt of Colorado and George
W. Childs of Philadelphia., The latter
and A. J. Drexel contributed $10,000 to
show their interest in the printing
craft and the principles underlying the
trade union movement.
In all trades the unipn, as an institu
tion, has had a beneficial effect. Hours
have been shortened and wages in
creased. Prison labor in open competi
tion with free labor has been opposed.
Legislation to protect the interests trf
the toller3 and to place all possible
safeguards around dangerous occupa
tions has always had the influence of
trade unionism behind it. Many laws
of this character have been Initiated
by the organized bodies of workers and
the results have proved beneficial tt/
mankind. The union stands for well
ventilated factories and sanitary condi
tions. Child labor is discouraged.
Sweatshops are opposed. Â» Dangerous
machinery is objected to unless proper
efforts are made to protect life. Em
ployes may now recover damages for
injuries occasioned by the criminal
neglect of employers. Compulsory edu
cation is favored. Many civic move
ments are supported by the trade
unions because the latter and good citi
zenship are synonymous terms.
The non-unionist enjoys most of the
results attained by organization with
out participation in the force that made
possible the improvement. The mer
chant and storekeeper are benefited by
the larger circulation of money secured
through the medium of the trade union
and the public generally is the gainer.
There is a phase of trade unionism
rarely referred to in the maze of words
published on the subject. It is becom
ing common for unions to lend a help
ing hand to their members in time of
sickness and distress. Death benefits
are a recognized part of the machinery
of .the present day organization. Many
a man's family has been relieved of
financial embarrassment at the time
the final debt of nature Is paid. Again,
some unions provide out r of- work funds
for their unfortunate members. This
is in marked contrast to the method
of discharging men for the crime of
appearing on this mundane sphere
thirty-five or forty years ago. The
home for aged and invalid trade union
ists may be considered a civilizing fac
tor.
The trade union is responsible for
many workers securing sleeping and
living quarters away from objection
able surroundings. The undertaker's
assistant or the milkman could testify
to the efficacy. of his organization in
this resDtct. Certainly healthy condi
tions tend to elevate. At one time the
individual knew" that protest wouXd be
unavailing. Hy ' combining 'with his
fellows he. has secured what is right
fully his. -
ters who infest seaports. Now he is
protected by his union. 'and the Fed
eral Government. The! latter secured
for him fair hours and wages, and the
laws guarding his interests . are * the
product of thersame source.
The trade union stands for one day'B
rest In seven. Before becoming a civ
ilized factor many , occupations re
quired a full week's work from the
employes. .The retail clerks have util
ized combination to frown on the Sun
day open shop and late hours through
five /days of the . week. The. majority
of employers co-operate with them in
these particulars. The shopkeeper who
"runs his own business" has a strong
tendency to run other people's as well
â employers and employes. Modern
conditions are too complex to allow
that -this method of argument is rea
sonable. The trade union is in a meas
ure responsible for the fruition of the
eld taw â "six days shalt thou labor."
The facilities afforded the thousands
benefited by the early-closing agitation
to .participate In the duties of civic
life and the pleasures of home cannot
be overestimated. And the organized
efforts -along these- lines benefit those
who criticize and hold aloof, and yet
are ever /willing to share in the gains.
Public interest is conserved by the
shortening of hours and the safeguards
thrown around the drug business. To
permit men to prepare prescriptions
containing deadly potions without rea
sonable relaxation is to invite danger
to the sick.
Tee trade union has made of the
railor a can, A few years ago he
could not understand the meaning of
the word "freeman." Imprisonment
stared him In the face should he leave
the ship in port. The authorities saw
to it that he sailed once the promise
was given. His wages were garnisheed
on the slightest pretext. He was the
prey of the crimps and shipping mas-
The trade union is an Important fac
tor in MFsisting the women to improved
conditions. '"Equal pay for equal
work" has long been the slogan of
those trades and callings shared be
tween the sexes. The injustice of tak
ing advantage of the weak simply be
cause of the want of strength is ap
parent to all fair-minded persons. The
occupations followed by women ex
clusively have had unreasonable hours
reduced, wages increased and sanitary
conditions instituted. Factory acts
and legislation designed to wage war
on abuses of greed and neglect have
had an earnest advocate in the labor
movement. Oftentimes the latter has
fathered, and championed laws to help
those unable by force of circumstances
to help themselves.
The trade union is erer vigilant in
opposition to child labor. This appall
ing system of making money at the
expense of sapping the life blood of
members of the coming generation is a
source of regret and wonder â not only
to our own citizens, but also to in
vestigators from foreign lands. Lack
of education is a menace to any coun
try. Stunting of physique degrades a
people. Children of tender years are
employed in mines, factories and shops.
Occasionally the exigency of circum
stances Impels parents to add to the
family income, but the duty of the
Mate is imperative- Laws remedying
this condition of affairs are lobbied
cgainst by interests not exactly im
personal or patriotic and their defeat
Is sometimes encompassed by illegiti
mate means. The glass workers' or
ganization of Minetola. in Southern
New Jersey, has taken seventy-flve
children from the unhealthy work of
the glass factories and sent them to
school, at the fame time paying the
email salaries they were accustomed to.
In one of the Southern States a typo
graphical union is paying for the edu
cation of future citizens of this republic
who were a few months. ago employed
in a mine â shut out from the sunlight,
from the pleasures of childhood and
from the opportunities that have an
upward, trend. Of the disinterested
ness of those associated with' the labor
movement in preserving the children of
both sexes other instances might be
named did space permit. Suffice It to
say that the trade unionist stands, with
those forces that have, for their object
the elevation and not tfie degradation
of childhood. â¢
form movements have one or more
individuals responsible for their, ex
istence, it is the concentration of pur
pose added to number* that wins. The
modern trade union has been criticized,
justly and unjustly, but its underlying
principles are founded on the doctrine
of the greatest good to the greatest
number, and the laudable desire to
remedy conditions at times intolerable
and always capable of improvement.
The labor movement sometimes needs
to be saved from its friends. Restric
tion oi^ membership, high initiation
fees, the false idea that men have not
an e<iual right to live and work, with
here and there an organization refusing
them admittance, and other abuses
that might be named, are recognized by
the student of the questions of the day
as wrong. We might as well be can
did. It pays, even though tt may not
always be popular. But recognizing
shortcomingsâ and what individual or
organization is without them?â the ef
fort to pull down the structure of
trade unionism instead of helping to
remedy its defects, calls for a dispas
sionate review of the results attained
by combination.
The trade union Is the mortal enemy
of the sweatshop and the tenement
house. It aims not merely to improve
the working conditions and enable the
worker to participate in the disposal of
his sole capital, but goes beyond by
improving the physical condition of the
men of the tenement districts, placing
the 'women in the home and the children
in the school. There was no thought
of abolishing the sweatshop until the
garment workers were organized.
IT 's now a recognized axiom that
all successful effort comes as the
result of organization. While re-

celved the ' hearty, indorsement of the

Where is the woman who would not
gladly' exchange the empty, worship of
the past for the real companionship of
the. present, with. Its sharing of life's
problems, and struggles! . .Â»;,
One has only to look over the records
of Ithe' American Federation of Labor
to realize, that the labor organizations
are' unqualified in. their condemnation
of child labor- Over ten years ago
pTestdent / Gompe*TB declared "the dam
nable system which permits young and
innocent children to have their very
lives worked out of them in factories,
mills; workshops and stores is one of
the very worst of labor, grievances, one
which the trade unions have protested
against for years; and In the reforma
tion of which we shall never cease our
agitation until we have rescued them
and placed them where they should
be. in : the Schoolroom and the play
ground.** .. Since then the president and
delegates have repeated and Indorsed
these' sentiments so often that they are
now looked upon as axiomatic, the last
committee on the! president's report re
marking, "that the child belongs in the
school and on the playground Instead
of- in* the workshop "and 1 factory is as
well known and recognized by those
not blinded by personal Interests as is
the multiplication table." ' j,.;-.-. â¢,-â¢-,.â¢
That the efforts .of- the federation
h&.ve not been confined to resolutions
is shown - by. President Gompers' re
port in 19Q2. He says: "We have
had representatives in- nearly every
Station" which' no "law of this char
acter obtained. Both by their work
and" that of our organizers and offi
cers - a sentiment of the' people has
been aroused that bids fair to result
English trades unionists with the. ex
ception, of the Lancashire weavers
have been far. more reluctant about ad
mitting women to their unions than the
American.' . . â¢ ..,' ,
That in this, as in coeducation, the
influence of the" Western States- of the
Union has-been potent is suggested by
the fact that in "1870 the Granger asso
ciations of Western, farmers announced
that' no grange should be organized or
exist without; women .as members, as
well as by the: large; number and full
recognition of '-Â¦ women trade unionists
in both Chicago and San Francisco.
:'-'. While women -have; been [ admitted
to membership in the older, more con
servative men's , unions for over twen
ty years, ' their greatest advance- In
numbers and Influence has been dur
ing 'thVlast ten years.' To-day women
not only sit as members in the central
labor unions ,of the great ; cities, Â¦ but
'also exercise '.'the full rights - of- dele
gates in the ."American Federation of
Labor} They' have not received such
recognition -in any/other national or
'ganization of men.'
That -this great central body -has
complete faith-in a wise use of,what
ever i power they i may help put into
the hands of women is proven by the
adoption of the .following resolution
in favor -of \ woman's suffrage, ; which'
was introduced by. Vice 'President
Duncan at-the.1903 meeting:l5SÂ£j
"Resolved. That" the best - interests
of labor reculre the admission : of
women to full citizenship as a matter
. of Justice Â»to i them â¢ and 'as a necessa ry .
step^ toward; insuring; and raising the
scale of â¢â¢wages ; for. rail." .-.*: 'â¢ ---'--
The, labor:- organizations ., have dis
covered :. that' the â¢ principles , of union-
Aside from this inherited incapacity
for organization, women have- been
deterred from any systematic and-per
sistent effort to better their condition
as workers by the feeling that their
employment was but a temporary ex
pedient, from which they would be
released by marriage. While, this
must continue to be true of a large
number of women workers, still as a.
class there can be no question of the
permanence of their position In the
industrial world or of the necessity
of developing the higher altruism"
which shall prompt temporary work
ers to guard the interests of less for
tunate, sisters, whose lives depend en
tirely on their conditions of work.
Notwithstanding these drawbacks to
organization on the part of the women,
their influence has not been | entirely
wanting in the v organizations of the
past. They were admitted on equal
terms with the men in the old English
crafts guilds;' and seem to have received
full recognition, both in the control. of
the affairs of the guild and in the con
sumption of ale.
"Women's unions were not unknown in
the early annals of English trades un
ionism. We hear, of them as early as
1833. To quote from history by Sydney
and, Beatrice Webb: "Nor were the
women neglected. The Grand Lodge of
Operative Bonnet Makers vies in activ
ity with the miscellaneous Grand Lodge
of the Women of Great Britain and Ire
land, and the Lodge- of. Female Tailors
asks indignantly whether the Tailors'
Order is really going to prohibit wom
en from making, waistcoats. 'Whether
the Grand National ' Consolidated
Trades : Union was responsible for the
lodges: of Female Gardeners and An
cient Virgins, who afterward distin
guished ; themselves .In _, the "riotous de
mand for an eight-hour day at Oldham,
is not' clear."
While we find these accounts of a.
somewhat fitful early activity on the
part of women's organizations, vet the
unionisjn applicable to men and women
alike. . , , y i
The men .have no -voice in the con
tract of labor which the women work
ers may make. It would be folly for
them to assume .the entire responsibil
ity, for their protection, even if . they
were able to Jlo ?o. Instead, the women
are allowed to become members of the
unions, on equal terms with the men
and must learn the same lessens of
mutual assistance and support. In no
other. American institution do women
receive stri - justice and equality
than Is given them In the labor organ
izations. The continuation of this pol
icy is insured by the fact that it is due
as much to economic necessity and the
nature and alms of trade unionism as
to sentiment.
Many causes have combined to
make it difficult for women to take
the first step toward organization.
While, as Professor Mason has shown,
they have fostered the. industrial arts
since the dawn of civilization, they
have worked in the isolation of the
family unit. As this writer says, "In
co-operation .women have always been
weak. There are few duties that they
have In common. Even? as beasts ' of
burden they seldom' worked In pairs."
Nor was this lack of industrial com
bination . replaced by any , other form
of! combination . through ".which . they
might gain social consciousness or a
realization of the power of -united ac
tion. . Nowadays the -women seem' to.
be making up for lost time in the way
of organization. Possibly the vast
number of women's, clubs have an-
otherihan'the and social'sig
nificance -which they claim. They
may be important factors In social
evolution, in that they help develop
the ; deficient social . consciousness '_â¢ In
women and prepare them' for - the
share-in our highly organized Indus-'
trial and political life which all the
present tendencies seem to make in
evitable.

hacfileajsped by their physical weak
cess and unaccsstosaed, environment.
Tet they have entered our sharply com
petitive industrial system, and must
often tike up single-handed a strug
gle tor existence in which the warfare
is co less sharp because the weapons
are the tools of manufacture and the
stake the supply 'or failure " of their
daily bread.
The fact that $ they have been ahle
to do t*is without loss of virtue, and
with an increasing degree of justice "
from the men who. are,., their competi
tors and employers proves chivalry to
be something more than & beautiful
dream of the past. \ That which the
plumed and armored knights often
treated as a mere â¢ sentimental mas
querade has sunk deep into the heart
of the common man, and in his sim
plicity and sincerity may yet give
deeper meaning to the knightly vows of
protection to womanhood and to the
weaker members of society.
The great army of men represented
by the American Federation of Labor
are pledged, to, the fulfillment of these
vows, not JÂ«3ply by the .ties which the
huiriiiTi .heart holds- most sacred, but
by the fundamental principle underly
ing the organizations,- and the stern
economical necessity that gives persist
ence and force to all their efforts.
Whose little ones gather the spools
and wat<fh the endless threads of the
cotton mlUs. or run tÂ«Â« and fro'on the
countless errands of the great stores?
These are not. the carefully protected
children of .the capitalist â¢ or profes
sional man. The frail young girl who
stands long hours behind the; counter
or sacrifices health and eyesieat- in
some basement' work room .is- "the
daughter' and sweetheart of a wage
worker. In proportion as the condi
tions surrounding the working man's
life become less brutalizing, his finer
human sentiments urge him to insist
on the protection of those bound to
him by the tenderest of human ties.
The labor organisations are not only
pledged to the protection of women
and children workers by these most
primitive and potent of human ties,
but by ideals that give deeper mean
ing to the movement. These teach that
the Interests of one are the interests of
all; that the weaker members must be
protected and assisted by the mainte
nance of a rood standard of living, and
that the selfish present advantage
must give way to the larger future
welfare of craft and class.
Economists assure us that wages are
largely determined *by the standard of
comfort . thnanded. by the workers.
The high standard of the American
workman is threatened, not alone by
the competition of foreigners, unable
to adopt it. but also by the more In
sidious inroads due to child labor., or
to some forms cf female 'competition.
How is a child whose immature mind
and body have been stunted .by the
deadening round of machine tending to
learn i>ride of race or attain the manly
vigor necessary to claim and defend
the privilege of his class? Occasion
ally one of exceptional strength may
overcome the difficulties of his youth,
but the majority grow up to reinforce
that class of "incompetents, mentally,
morally and physically, who prove
heavy burdens within the unions, or
without them menace their ' fellow
workmen more seriously by. their short
sighted' readiness to accept the lower
standard acalr.Et which the unions are
struggling.
Dr. Englemann. in a recent investi
gation of the health of women of the
professional and working classes, finds
that v.'or.ea who have undergone the
severe mental training necessary for a
professional career suffer much less
from the ills peculiar to women than
the working girls, with their long hours
of standing and confinement. Direct
observers, like the Van Vorsts. lay
great emphasis on- the universally un- '
sanitary conditions under which
woaien work, and the resulting preva
lence of m anaemic and distorted
physiques. These women will be the
mothers of the next generation of
American workmen. The most ef
fective and far-reaching efforts to pro
mote class and national welfare will
begin with their protection.
Amons the laws enacted in this coun
try for the protection of women are
those limiting the number of hours of
work per week that may be required
of women, laws compelling employers
to furnish seats for the use of female
employes and laws prohibiting night
v ork. Several European countries have
laws regulating the- employment of
married women, particularly those with
young children. These laws have not
always been backed by the labor
unions and by no means express fully
their policy in dealing with women'
workers.
In the dosing paragraphs of an ar
ticle recently published in The Annals
of the American Academy of Political
and Social Science, Walter Macarthur
cays:
"The attitude of the American trade
unionist is that of appeal* to .the spirit
of independence and to a realization of
the truth that the workers are them
selves the sole repository of power to
better their lot. The solemn lesson of
history, to-day, and every, day of our
lives, is that the workers must depend
npon themselves for the Improvement
of the condition* cf labor."
This Is' the stern doctrine of trade
in the adoption at no distant day oÂ£
svch -beneficent measures - .in all thÂ«
States , of the Union." â¢Largely as *;
result of . this activity of .the labor.
uniajjs, . ihild labor laws ha^ b*ea
exacted during the last ttrk years in,
no less than thirty-two States of thÂ«
Uvion- 'In the majority of these States

British merchandise subject to -the
stamp tax. The refusal of the colonial
dames to buy English clothing and
taxed tea was a boycott, but- the act
of raiding a merchant ship and-throw
ing its cargo of tea â¢ overboard was a
thing entirely distinct from (he boy
i-ott. The boycott began and ended'
with the refusal to purchase i the â¢
stamped commodities and the organ-'
ized appeal to all colonists to refrain
from purchasing or using them. ':- _ '.
The boycott, in its effective form,
namely, as a peaceful and respectful*
appeal to the public to "discontinue
patronizing those whose course x>t. busi
ness and treatment or labor is consld- ..,
ered to be unfair and oppressive, isÂ«
absolutely and unquestionably legal
and conforms perfectly -to every mon*l
principle V h i c h ,
should govern the
conduct of . men.
If the demand
sought' to be eri
' forced be unrea- !
son able Â¦ public
sentiment will
condemn the boy
rntt. and defeat
pend at all upon the -^irpose . or
end sought to be accomplished* by it.
Temperance people have' a perfect legal
right to unite' in withdrawing their
.patronage f ronj all persons engaged In
.the sale of Intoxicating, liquors, and, if
they l brfodse, they have an equal right
in ee'ricert to agree-to withdraw their
Â¦patronage from all persons who patron
ize, the sellers of intoxicating liquors,
and they Â¦ have a right to request all
' members of the community - to Â¦Â¦' join
them in so boycotting' the liquor sellers
arid' their â¢ patrons. The liquor aellers,
I on the other hand, have the same legal
right to act 'In concert'in withdrawing
.their patronage from all temperance
people \ and; ;* fronv. all who, patronize
those who favor abstinence from the
use of intoxicating liquors. The gam
blers have; a perfect legal right peace
fully and ; respectfully toVagree among
themselves not to patronize those who
are opposed to the practice of that vice,
and *to appeal to the.;" community" . to
withdraw their patronage from such
persons. If' the . moral sens,e; of the
community be opposed to the sale and
use of intoxicating Hquors 'the
temperance boycott will be sus
tained and, liquor selling- will
be limited to such places as are visited
and patronized by liquor drinkers only/
If the sentiment of the cdmrriunlty be
against the enforcement of abstinence
from liquor, In that way the boycott
will fall. So In the other case: if public
sentiment favors gambling, to the exr
tent' of condemning those who' do not
believe in and support it, the, gamblers'
boycott would" prove effective; other
wise it would' fail. But in all these
cases the boycott in favor of a bad pur
pose is just as legal as the boycott in
favor of a good purpose, and is to be
upheld "or. condemned only according
to the merit and expediency of its pur-
Rose. ,
'.'The proper use of the boycott can
not be successfully attacked upon- any
ground, legal or moral. The continued
effectiveness of
the boycott and

upon a thorough

the legitimate

measure. The
rules of practice
in tlte case are
well . established
and need only be
cited to suggest at
once the errors,
actual or^contem
plated, in any
given easy? â¢
'"In considering
these rules it is
important to bear
in mind that the
boycott is first and
last an appeal
to the nubile, spe
cifically to the
purchasing pub
lic. In so far aa
the organized
workers are in
cluded amon^; the
public, the bt/ycott
is an appeal to
them as purchas;
ers, not as work
ers. With this un
derstanding of the
nature of the- boy-
Labor organizations have with a fre
quency that has" been discouraging to
friends of organized labor, and no doubt
discouraging to its own best inforrned
leaders, engaged in ' boycotts which
could' not be given the sanction of pub
lic approval, and have too frequently
permitted violence, menaces of violence
and boisterous conduct in connection
with their boycotts to alienate public
sympathy and to arouse a conscious
and implacable resentment and hostil
ity in the public mind. A recognition of
this very Important fact in connection
with the labor, movement and struggle
is to be found in the writings of many
of its leaders, one' of whom In a mas
terly article recently published on this
subject says:,
"It behooves the labor movement of
the United States to be on guard lest
the loose and reckless application of the
boycott shall lead to the expurgation of
that Institution as a fact of history,
the rewriting of. which may cost the
labor movement many a day of toil and
sorrow. . >
The name "boycott" originated in an
incident of the Irish Land League
struggle, in which a Captain Boycott
particularly antagonized the purposes
of the league, and the league and all of
its friends agreed not to deal with the
captain either directly or indirectly, to
simply have nothing to do with him
nor with those who chose to ally them
selves with him. But in that case it
was the mere application- of the: old
principle of ostracism applied to those
whose conduct was contrary, to the
public sense of propriety or justice or
morality or patriotism.
As a weapon in the hands of or-
It is said that the boycott Is un-
American. This cannot be truly, said
of the boycott in any general sense, be
cause the. principle of the boycott is
as old and as universal as civilization
itself. It has been used in all ages
by churches and governments and- by
social, commercial and political organ
izations for the purpose of enforcing
their ideas of religion, morality, pat
riotism. Justice, moral virtues and so
cial order. For example, boycotts have
been Instituted and successfully main
tained in select neighborhoods and
localities a gains* grocers maintaining
saloons in connection with their stores,
against gambling and against various
forms of vice and irregularity of con
duct in social affairs.
The public conscience, which, when
quickened by sympathy for a Just
cause, is an all-conquering force, is im
placable in its resentment when
aroused by a sense of imposition. As
organized labor finds its surest depend
ence in public support of a boycott
that is approved by conscience, so it
finds its surest condemnation in Dublic
opposition to a boycott which is unjust
in itself, or which Is prosecuted "by un
just means.
The fierce assaults made upon the
boycott in general by the opponents of
organized labor are Inspired by a
knowledge of the public temper toward
any appeal upon false grounds, and the
hope that by determined opposition to
the boycott the public will be forced
to discriminate more keenly than here
tofore as between the merits of the
various appeals to its support Under
lying this policy there is also the hope
that the public, once arrested by ap
peal to its prejudice and its pride, may
find in the general practice of the boy
cott sufficient evidence of impropriety
to compel a review of Its whole attitude
toward that institution. That some
organizations are by no means free
from error In their manner of prosecut
ing the boycott is a fact that cannot
safely be Ignored by organized labor. .
The boycott must be distinguished
in all eases fnom the incidents which
accompany It and also from " the con
ditions in connection with which it is
generally resorted to. For example, a
boycott may occur simultaneously with
a labor strike or with a lockout of
laborers by an employer or by concert,
of action among employers, but in all
such cases the strike or lockout may
exist in its completeness without a boy
cott. So, It has been observed that
boycotts are frequently accompanied
by rioting, physical violence and
abusive epithets on. *the part either
of the boycotters or of sympathizers,
or of those who merely take advantage
of the occasion to create trouble and
disturbance. But the boycott Itself is
an absolutely peaceful appeal to the
public sentiment and the public con
science by'the persons invoking it, and
its effectiveness as a means or weapon
for accomplishing the end sought is al
ways lessened and weakened by every
incidental act or threat or menace of
violence. The appeal of the boycotter
to the public must be absolutely peace
ful and absolutely respectful In order
to be effective, because every departure
from that rule creates resentment in
the public mind and turns the- very
power to which the boycotter appeals
against him. . : 7 **;
In the great conflict between capital
and labor the boycott. Justly applied j
and rightfully exercised, has been
found to be one of organized Kbor's
most effective weapons; but unjustly
applied or wrongly exercised' it has
been found to be organized â¢'â¢ labor's
greatest menace. It is the worst kind
of folly to inaugurate. a boycott which
docs r.ot in its substance, occasion and
purpose appeal to the public conscience,
the public sense of justice and to. the
common sense of the people, otherwise
the people receive it with tllsfavor and
it causes a revulsion -of public senti
ment and reacts injuriously upon the
labor movement.
Â£""rÂ«*HE consideration which I have
I jriven to the boycott has related
I almost entirely to ' its legality
I and morality in the abstract, and,
., not particularly to the propriety
or effectiveness of its use in particular
Â».i5cs. It may be denned as a method
of bringing social and commercial
pressure to bear upon- those against
whom It is used for the purpose of in
ducing or compelling a change In their
attitude toward the boycotters. It is
always a means and not an end, and
it may therafore be either good or bad,
according to the end sought to be ac
complished. A boycott in favor of an Â«
object essentially and universally Rood
is necessarily good in Itself, while a
boycott in favor of a bad end is essen
tially bad. Between these two extremes
there is a great class^of purposes which
are relatively geod or bad, or which
are good for tome classes of people and
bad for others, the promotion of which
l.y the boycott may be justifiable or un
justifiable, according to the proportion
of jrood or evil which would result.
Such Organized appeals to the pub
lic may and most frequently do involve
Injustice and oppression on either
side. When capital is in the ascend
ency It is -prone to oppress labor, not
for the purpose of oppression, but for
its own profit. When organized labor
Is in the ascendency It Is also in
clined to make extreme and unjust
demands, not merely for the oppres
sion of erftployers, but for its own
gain and advantage. The Just equi
librium must be reached by the pres
sure of public sentiment upon both of
the great contending forces and in or
der that that public sentiment may
operate quickly and effectively to es
tablish a reign of justice and to pre
vent *"the alternating periods of op
pression by employers, and by organ
ized 'laborers. . each should be encour
aged to make Its appeal peacefully
and respectfully to the public con
science, the public sense of justice and
to the ultimate tribunal of popular
common sense. It should be remem
bered that while organized labor often
does Injustice, it Is not organized for
the purpose of doing injustice, but
for the purpose of securing justice to
the classes of the civilized world who
have heretofore been most oppressed.
Human society is in the throes of
an industrial crisis, which may be
compared to fermentation. That fer
mentation necessarily Involves .pres
sure and. hardship, but In Its natural
process we know that purification and
better conditions will Inevitably re
sult. We should therefore, while en
deavoring as much as possible to min
imize evil results of ita mistaken pol
icies and acts, encourage and promote
its general purpose.

"In essence the sympathetic strike is
i demonstration of sympathy, as con
tradfstlriguished from an act of sub
stantial aid. The real principle of the
sympathetic strike may be best defined
by the adage: 'Misery loves company-'
In the case of the boycott the rule Is
precisely the same. By continuing at
work, notwithstanding he may be
handling a boycotted article, the trade
unionist is enabled to render material
assistance to those immediately con
cerned; whereas by quitting work he
merely adds his own weight to the bur
den of his fellows.
"Another established rule for the
prosecution of the boycott i3 that it
shall not be levied upon the product
of union labor, notwithstanding the
employer of" such labor may be em
ploying non-union- labor in- other con
nections. .The boycott should not be
used against an entire establishment
as a means of affecting the sales of one
or more' articles contained In the, stock
In trade. The boycott should not be
placed upon a company against any of
the partners in which there is no com
plaint for the purpose of affecting one
01 more partners who may have fallen
under the ban because of dealings in
another business. Finally, the boy
cott should be applied only to articles
of public use and upon .the disposal of
which the public can exercise a de
termining influence."
Being in the abstract neither illegal
nor immoral, the boycott Is to be ad
judged and dealt with according to the
particular purpose and manner of ap
plication In each case in which it is
resorted to. Force, .violence and men
aces of force or violence, whether used
in connection with the boycott or in
dependently of It, whether, resorted to
by labor unions or by employers, should
always be ! strictly forbidden by law
and rigorously suppressed by the im
partial enforcement of such laws, but
tne 'appeal to reason, to sympathy and
to the moral support of the community,
In favor of laborers In general or par
ticular classes of labor or particular
laborers,, whether ,, belonging to the
union or not belonging to the union,
should always be encouraged and fairly
considered by every community as be
ing the best possible process of bring
ing the public conscience to bear In
regulating and determining the mutual
relations and obligations of all mem
bers of our oompllcated society to each
other in their industrial and com
mercial . relations.
"A boycott so conducted as to in
volve any stoppage of labor becomes
In effect a sympathetic strike. In both
cases the principle is the same; conse
quently in both cases the same objec
tions apply. The principle, or rather
assumption, of .the sympathetic strike
is tUat the stoppage of work i3 of
necessity the most effective means by
which one body of workers can render
aid to another. The objection to the
sympathetic strike rests primarily upon
the self-evident wisdom of confining
the area of a given, strike within the
smallest possible compass. By follow
ing the latter course the workers are
enabled to render financial assistance
to their fellows on strike; whereas by
going on strike themselves they not
ohly absorb their own reserve funds,
but shortly become claimants of sym
pathy | from other bodies of workers.
Thus the area of the sympathetic strike
enlarges by an inevitable rule of pro
gression.
cott the dividing line between that
measure and the strike becomes ob
vious. The firgt rule in the case is that
the boycott' shall be carried so far, and
only so far, as the purchasing power
extends. Stated conversely, the boy
cott should riot be carried beyond the
line of the purchasing power and into
the sphere of the producing power, so
as to require not only a 'refusal to pur
chase a certain commodity, but also a
refusal to perform labor indirectly or
casually associated with its production
or distribution.
"Unless this distinction be drawn It
is inevitable that there can be no stop
ping place between the boycott and the
sympathetic strike; The justification,
and, indeed, the imperative necessity,
of the rule here cited will be apparent
upon reflecting that a boycott prose
cuted without regard to that rule would
involve untold numbers of workers in
callings more or Ies3 distinct and un
connected. Such a boycott, so far from
being an appeal for public support
against a certain employer, would be
merely an appeal to the labor move
ment to commit wholesale suicide.

Although always conspicuous
among the % organized crafts of the
State, the printers did not long enjoy
sole honors in the v.urk of onranisa-
In 1S49 an article appeared in the
Boston Guide, announcing the forma
tion in San Francisco of an American
printers' union. This was probably an
allusion to the Pacific Typographical
Society. At this time printers' wages
averaged J2 50 per 1000 ems, as com
pared with the present rate of about
40 cents. Time hands received $12 50
per day, and overtime at the rate of
j: Â£0 per hour. Even -the office boy,
it is said, received $30 per week. These
njjures represented boom rates, and
Uiey did not last long.
As a result of the downward tend
ency, we find notice of a meeting, held
In U50, by the printing fraternity for
the purpose of devising a plan to es
tablish a general system of time work-
Already the rate of printers' wages
bad "dropped to $2 per 1000 ems. Im
mediately after" the great fire of 1853,
wages fell to the comparatively low
pcint of $1 50 per 1000 ems.
Evidently the latter figure repre
sented what was then regarded as the
"subsistence limit." At this period,
1Â£51. we note the first strike in the
printing trades, against a reduction
from ;i 50 to $1 25 per 1000 ems,
proposed by the publishers of the Alta
newspaper. A "stay away" notice was
ics-ued by the printers, advising the
members of the craft in the "States" â
that is, Ih the East â to refrain from
coming to California. The strike was
successful, and wages remained, for
the time at least, at the rate of Jl 50
jer 1000 ems.
The Pacilic Typographical Society
vxxs merged into the Eureka Union,
wnich body was chartered by the Na
tlonul Typographical Union in 1855.
In 1872, when the International Typo
graphical Uuion was formed, the title
of- "Old Eureka" was changed and the
union became known as Tj'pograph
ical Union No. 21 of San Francisco,
which designation has since been held
by that body. Thus the local Typo
graphical Union enjoys the distinction
not only of the longest consecutive ex
istence but of being the first trade
union in the State to form a national
and internalional alliance with tbe
craft at larre. ffft]
THE origin of labor organization
in California is contemporan
eous with, if it does not actu
ally antedate, the discovery of
gold. Among the numerous
fragmentary records of that early day
we find suggestions of concerted ac
tion among the printing trades as far
back as 1846. in wfcich year the first
newspaper was issued in the State.
ThÂ£ precarious conditions of jour
nalism at that time are Illustrated by
the fact that in 1848 a half-sheet, is
sued by the California Star, announced
the suspension of publication owing: to
the cry of "gold, gold, gold," which
had lured all hands â printers, sub
scribers, etc. â to the scene of the
"diggins." Prosperity killed it!
the abolition of the prevailing system
of dividing labor into -four or five
classes.', and for the .establishment of
two rates of wages, I. e., $3 and $2 50
per day for first and second class
miners, respectively, and for the aboli
tion of Chinese competition with white
labor. The. result of the miners' strike
is highly suggestive of the saying that
â¢â¢history, repeats itself." The militia
was called out. and tbe strike was com
promised. A contem;>orary newspaper
report informs us that "the San Fran
cisco militia . companies engaged in
maintaining. the peace and dignity of
the law at Amador are deserving of
credit." From the same source we learn
that the strikers "sained little and lost
much," although they "had the satis
faction of knowing that the mining
companies were placed under heavy
expense." â¢ "
The general conditions-of . the State
Â«t this. time, were described by the
New York World as a "singular com
bination of circumstances â labor for
ever on a strike, as It were, and' land
held almost in feudalism." This con
dition." according to the World, "is
quite enough to. account for the. de
cadence of California which for some
years past her electoral figures pre
sent."
In 1871a brandi â¢ of the National
Labor Union League was formed. This
body had political ambitions. It in-
tion. The excitement attendant upon
the rush to the gold fields had- hardly
begun to abate when the enormous
immigration of Chinese began to at
tract the attention of the pioneers.
Anti - Chinese.', agitation spread
throughout the â¢ State. Legislative
measures of a. local character were
proposed and evidently with some suc
cess, since we read that *ln March,
1852, a bill. to enforce contracts -to la
bor was defeated upon the represent
ation that it was a measure designed
to facilitate the Importation of cheap
labor from Asia. About this time a
commission was formed for the pur
pose of crystallizing, public sentiment
against the Chinese, which body may
be regarded as the parent of. all the
subsequent agitation which culminat
ed in the Chinese exclusion act of the
present day.
The decade of 1850-60 wascharac
terized by the growth of organization
among the 'various trades and callings,
then established as a result of the de
velopment of industry in the State. An
interesting sidelight, is thrown upon
this phase of the State's growth by
the figures of the United States cen
sus for 1860, which give the profes
sional and industrial callings and the
numbers of persons engaged therein,
as follows: Herdsmen, SOI;Â»innkeep
ers, 1404; laborers, 25,394; . laun
dresses, 1918; lawyers, 894; lumber
men, 1051; mariners, 3078; masons,
533: merchants. 5087; miners, 82.573;
packers, 673; . painters, 1023; physi
cians, 1122; printers, 621; ranchers,
751; refectory keepers, 1859.
In 1663, immediately after' the publi
cation of these figures of the State's
industries, we find unmistakable evi
dences of further rapid growth in the
existence of a" powerful union of tail
ors. In the same year a strike of tail
ors took place, against the large
amount of fancy work- put upon the
coats of the period. This strike was
successful at. the end of several weeks.
In other respects the Tailors' Union
demonstrated- its -ability, to protect- its
members in the various matters of in
terest to the craft
The first evidences of organization in
the building* trades are found in ' the
records of the House Carpenters' Eight
hour League,', organized -in 1867. This
body was formed, as its name implies,
primarily for the purpose of establish
ing the shorter workday. In this con
nection it is- interesting ; to note that
much of the "spirit of organization"
prevailing among the working classes
of those times was inspired Â¦ by 'the
same general purpose, â¢ to wit.; the re
duction of the dally hours of. labor.
The work of the House . Carpenters'
Eight-hour League was not confined,
however, to a single object. From the
newspapers' of the day we learn that
this body met in Dashaway Hall on
July. 12. 1870. and adopted . a resolution
approving ' the course of the Knights
of SU Crispin (presumably the fore
runner of the Boot and. Shoe Workers'
Union of to-day) in opposition to Chi
nese labor. Other measures were acted
upon at this meeting which ' are " of

Under the pressure of various circum

now began .to decline. The year 1S91
was signalized by the establishment of
the Manufacturers' and Employers' As

It. carried on a persistent and â¢ in the

HISTORY OF ORGANIZED LABOR IN CALIFORNIA
The pedigree of the trunk is thus
recorded here because it soon eluded
me and many years elapsed before I
owned another. Eternal vigilance is
the price of trunks, and likewise
valises, among the poor and foolish.
With the stew in front of me and that
pallid flim-flammer seated In her orig
inal chair, the picture of . unconscious
virtue â¢ and innocence, my first feeling
of fear gave way to indignation border
ing on wrath. Did she take me for a
lobster? Well, I should hope not; but
all the same she had me going for a
while. Whether or no the lady kept a
cook didn't matter three hoots in the
hot place so far as I was concerned. I
never had monkeyed with oysters save
at church sociables at Mudvllle. where
everything was square and aboveboard.
To find that passive bivalve used as a
medium of deceit annoyed and disgust
ed me. And the bold trick of that
brazen Mrs. Bunk bred in my tender
bosom a distrust for the sex which en
dures to this day.
Â» The oysters were good. " After throw
ing in the warm poultice I produced a
roll fit to choke a canary bird, gave

So It came about that one winter
day, with the trunk masquerading as
baggage and me bumping the red
plush In a varnished car, we bore down
on Omaha. En route through Iowa
I studied the whisker exhibits Installed
on depot platforms, there being noth
ing else worth looking at. The leading
export of the State at that time was
prohibition literature, while the in
habitants raised whiskers . for home
consumption. Also I obssrved experi
enced travelers in the coach drinking
from bottles. These alcoholic festivi
ties made me feel like a four-flusher.
Having failed to provide a bottle of
my own, I looked for the conductor
to flag me at every mile post on the
ground that I hud made h false start.
That he tolerated one no remiss in his
duty to society amazed me.
Even now, after a lapse of twenty
five vears, this problem racks and nuz
zles.*. Why will the man who spends
n decade at home, never thinking of
liquor, load up with a quart canteen
and souse himself Billy on a forty-mile
ride? Search me. Doesthe motion of
the train arouse latent thirst, or. does
the gent think the neck of the bottle
protruding 1 from his raiment brands
him a traveler of world-wide repute?
Funny, isn't it, what mutts .you meet

Â¦ Early on the morning of the second
day the train reached Omaha and al
lowed me to mingle in the fierce met
ropolitan whirl. I left the trunk at
the depot for a, look around before
doing anything rash. It was great â

On the rounds of -the 'town I had
located in a side street a swagger cafe, ,
bearing this sign:' "The "Delbeano;

blue .adorned with Â¦"Â¦ this' legend:"
"Meals 15 'cents and Upward," 'which

On , pushing open the â¢ blue, door a
bell tinkled' above the portal and I
glanced back to see who was ringing
it : The* interior Delbeano was. tt.
gaunt room harboring a few tables
and a portholed partition at the back,
through- w.h!ch the ambushed cook
fired victuals at unwary patrons.
There were two vivid works of art on
opposite walls. One was the likeness
of a fat man. inscribed "I Eat Here."
His partner on the other side, a hag
g.ird gentleman, who looked like Mr.'
Dante, did not eat there, according to
his epitaph. Where he did replenish
his inner being will forever, remain "a
mystery to me. Belowthe" thin man
hung a business motto.- "No Trust. No

While- noting these appetizing spe
cialties 1 became conscious of a . hu-,
man presence in the room. At <a table
in the rear sat a razor-faced female
of middle age gazing fixedly at me out
of snaky eyes. Her face was without
expression save the black sparks that
glowed at either side of her beak. As
she looked at me I tried to. look in
another. direction and failed. Once I
made a bold point at the "No Trust.
No Bust" poem, but fearing this effort
to appear natural might lay me. open
to unjust suspicion, I switched to the
epicure who ate there. The undoubted
Â¦ ' success of that person Induced me to
sit down and open a bill of fare which
resembled a ball programme minus the
lead pencil.

the only hot food ever served at the

."oysters" in a voice inaudible to my
self. ' Had I been a man of brains and

â¢â¢ Aiming her face toward the rear,
Mrs. Bunk .yelled, "One stew!" and
then leisurely .placed some tools and a
dish of cold-slaw on the table. Mean
v.hlle, no sound had come from the
kitchen. The order was not bellowed
back in true metropolitan fashion. In
a. little while Mrs.' Bunk strolled into
the culinary works and instantly there
issued the stealthy rattle of pots and
a -sound of some one raking the fire.
Soon the dark eyed lady emerged,
wearing an air of extreme abstraction.
She went, to the front window, shifted
the" pink pig to an easier position
among the beans and gazed into the
-street. Having me in her_toils that
siren of the West worked her little
game to- the limit. Â« nee she did face
,about to shriek. "Hurry up that stew;
the gent's a-waiting!" No response.
Once more Mrs. Bunk ducked into, the
kitchen;, again I heard the sneaky rat

when she slid the bowl. upon a shelf in
the open partition.. Moreover, I recog

ANNOUNCEMENT.
For the purpose of encouraging -California and Western writers,
by offering a consideration for short stones equal to that paid by the
best magazines, and for the purpose of bringing young and unknown
writers to the front, the Sunday Call announces a weekly fiction con-
test in which a cash prize of $50 will be paid each week for the best
story submitted. There is no section of America more fertile in ma-
terial for fiction or more prolific in pens gifted to give spirit to the
material at hand than is California and the West Therefore the Sun-
day Call offers $50 for the best story submitted each week by a West-
ern writer. Stories of Western life and Western characters will, as a
rule, be given the preference, but all strong stories, and especially
strong stories by new writers, will receive careful consideration.
Each story will be iudeed strictly upon its literary merit. Type-
written copy is the easiest to read and will receive the first consider-
ation from the editor, but do not hesitate to send a story in hand-
writing if you cannot afford to have it typewritten." A :-'
Fifty dollars in cash for a story of not less than 3500 words and
not more than 3500 words is approximately $17 per thousand words.
or 1.7 cents per word. The highest price paid by the leading magazines
for the work of any but the very best writers is rarely, more than
two cents a word, more often one cent and a half, and generally one
crnt. With the majority of magazines the writer, after his story is ac-
cepted, is compelled to wait until the publication of his story before
be is paid, a period of seldom less than six months, and usually from
nine months to a year. The stories accepted in this contest will be
paid for immediately upon publication, and will be published on the
first Sunday following the iudping of the week's manuscripts.THE , SAN 'FRANCISCO SUNDAY GALI1

used her last card now, and these peo

sighed.

The mother who is never pleased,

There is precious little satisfaction in
trying to please one who never appre
ciates either the effort or the work it
self, and one's nerves is the excuse for
ill humors indulged In without rhyme
or reason.
Illness is often but another name for
laziness. It is so much more comfort
able to have one wait on you than to
wait on yourself, and often the Indolent
mother takes refuge behind her "poor
nerves" to shift the responsibility on
the younger shoulders, and they expect
as much from a girl of IS as could rea
'ionably be demanded of a woman of
60. Illness Is a trying ordeal to both
patient and nurse, and of the two it
would seem that the nurse has the
harder row to hoe. A patient who Is
amiable challenges all one's sympathy
do in this tortuous world, and yet a
pleasant face is something that can be
cultivated. No good ever results from
the chronic display of ill-humor that
mars so many lives. There la not only
a deal of philosophy, but there is also
a vast amount of deep-seated religion
in the practice of making 1 the best of
everything. No child was ever bene
fited or improved by nagging:, while to
many it has been the source of so
much discouragement that the sweet
est part of all interest In life is embit
tered, and there U no denying that a
child will learn to dread, if not to ab

much easier for all parties concerned.
It is desperately hard for one who is
ill to be tied to a sick bed or an inva
lid's chair, but it is infinitely harder
for one who Is well to be confined to
the sick room with all its depressing
influence. -
Many invalids are so lovable and con
siderate that one feels as if they could
never do enough to help them bear and
to alleviate as far as possible the suffer
ing. Others there are whom the com
bined offices of the nine choirs of angels
would utterly fail to please. Every ef
fort Is met with a whine or a reproach,
until human nature rebels at the in
justice of it all.
Fault finding is more a matter of ill
nature than of real grievances. The
man or woman who contracts the habit
finds that It grows on their hands, un
til It becomes a settled fact that no
matter what may occur, or how hard
others try to please them, no credit Is
to ba given for it.
A man fancies that a certain amount
of fault finding- is necessary to the
proper discipline of his home, and that
the full mastery of domestic condi
tions depends upon the awe he In
spires. Did he praise his wife she
might possibly become imbued with a
certain Idea of her own importance,
for which reason the heavy hand of
the lord and master must be felt.
There are mothers who are insanely
jealous of their own daughters, not
only as far as the husband: and father
i3 concerned, but in the matter of
social triumphs. A woman who la
handsome and charming, and accus
tomed to swaying her own little world
about her, sees with envy and chagrin
the beauty and charm of the daugh
ter unfolding. That the scepter she
has wielded so and successfully
must slip from her fills her small soul
with horror, and after a systematic
coursa of fault-fllnding drivtes the
daughter to matrimony or worse, be
cause there are really some few things
that might prove even worse than
matrimony.
There is not much good that we can

generally "unwept, unhonored and un

self-sacrifice that reaps no compensa
tion, and who are oppressed with a
sense of failure that has no sedative
to console.
There is always a lot of sentiment
haloing the sacred name of "mother,"
and yet there are lots of mothers who
know Just about as much of its sacred
ness as they do of many of the lost arts.
The ingratitude of children is prover
bial, but often there are times when the
scenes might be shifted and a few
pointed paragraphs illustrative of the
ingratitude of parents substituted.
In the sprouting days of nay news

was sent to many publications, and as
unerringly returned with thanks, "that
It was against the policy of the paper
to publish anything reflecting on the
discipline between parents and chil
dren." although admitting its merit.
The one-sided view* struck me as
rather unjust from the fact that chil
dren and their peccadilloes, the result
of thoughtlessness and inexperience,
â¢were hammered unmercifully, while
parents equally guilty, yet with
years of experience to guide them, were
never shown the errors of their ways. .
The most selfish, inconsistent, irre
eponsible women are often held up by
the world as splendid mothers, when
they have not a sensible idea in their
heads and are infinitely inferior in
every way to the daughters whom they
not only disparage, but of whom they
are intensely jealous and whom' they
criticize to the verge or even dam
aging the reputation by inuendoes
which, coming from the mother, no one
ever tiiinks of questioning.
More girls are ruined by their own
mothers than from all the /emptations
that ever asail them from the outside.
A home is made so unhappy by con
tinual nagging and fault-finding that a
girl seeks any relief that may be of
fered, no matter in what guise it may
come.
The number of happy homes is sur
prisingly small, and the woman whom
necessity forces to mingle with the
Â¦world, who day after day goes hither,
thither and yon, gathers an assortment
of confidences that wearies her brain
and makes her very heartsick, and of
which those of unhappy daughters and
husbands figure in largest proportion.
Few mothers have sense enough to
make allowances for a girl's impul
siveness or inexperience, consequent
ly mistakes are exaggerated Into
crimes and the high-spirited, rebel
lious girl Is thrown upon the world
with neither guide nor affection to
steer her through the troublous cur
rents.
The fault-finding mother is more
than a problem; she is an established
fact and an appalling menace, and

IN THE SICK-ROOM (Novice)â An
immense amount of brain as well as
physical force must be used in caring
for the sick. Tact, patience and a slav
ish devotion to, details are necessary in
relieving the tedium of the sick room.
Radical diversions snould only be
taken under skilled advice arid the ob
servant nurse must know when to ex
clude any Innovation which will excite
or weary a patient. She must plan
tactfully only such little surprises as
will please and relieve monotony, mak
ing the sick room as cheerful as cir-
cumstances will permit. A pot of fresn
greenplants, a change In the arrange

slight thing will often supply a won

wearied patient. Tiresome, talkative
persons should be rigidly excluded
from the,; sick room at all times;

and put a little in the water and see

ordinary toilet water is drying. When
you chance near the bottle put a little
on your handkerchief and rub your
face. Of, course, this is the mildest
treatment and I am suggesting it be
cause it Is not difficult to remember or
annoying to do, and alcohol in any
form is drying. If this does not have
the desired effect let me know and I
will give you a medicine that will take
that oily appearance away. You did
not give me your weight and so' I

ABOUT BROAD SHOULDERS Liz
zie)âFashion is not always as foolish
as we are led to believe. Like most
customs of civilized life the harmful
mistakes or abuses are being continu
ally harped upon, but the real values,
which are constantfy coming to tha
fore, are scarcely considered until they
are old stories. The fashionable broad
shoulder waists are cases in point. The
broad shoulder effect has already
proven a blessing to â¢womankind which
will be handed down to posterity. It has
not only inspired but forced the need
for better physical development. Force
of example has demonstrated, as ar
gument never has. the pitiful differ
ence between a narrow, fiat chest and
shoulders which have so long . been
accepted as truly feminine, and the
beauty of strong, well-molded lines.
The first Improvement' in form was al
most entirely a matter of the dress
maker's art; later not a little dismay
was felt when the difficulty of fitting a
thin shirt waist, which cannot be built
out by the tailor's tricks, over a thin,
flat form was encountered. Then, and
not till then, was the physical defect
indisputable and women who had not
enjoyed the privileges of gymnasium
practices realized that they must de
velop their bodies to \ keep up with
the .pace set by fashion.' The fact
that you Â¦ observe so many robust
women to-day Is not that they all
happened to be born healthy, but
they have made themselves strong and
rosy by careful living. You can do the
same by daily practice and a simple,
wholesome diet. In the main you
have little to complain of besides your
thin arms and chest. Deep breathing
should be faithfully practiced and the
following simple exercises used; they
are especially useful in developing the
chest and arms: Ventilate tlife room
thoroughly and slip on a kimona. Rest
the hands on the legs just above the
knees, relax. the muscles of the back
and bend the body forward, resting the
-weight* upon the arms and. hands. As
the legs bend at the ' knees the face
ly and tucked in firmly And the under
garments worn by the patient straight
ened occasionally. Ventilation Is of
paramount Importance; pure air will
soothe and refresh a patient as noth
ing else can. To prevent catching cold
cover the patient with a warm blan
ket, head and all, and tnrow the v win
dows open for fifteen minutes at in
tervals during the day, further pro
tecting the patient by placing a screen
about the bed. To impart a delightful
refreshing odor to the room, fill a bowl
with hot water and pour In a few drops
of oil of lavender, just enough to give
a faint, sweet odor. Never use heavy
perfumes.
I know it's worse than hackneyed
to tell you to "Do as you would be
done by," but the man or woman who
follows this homely old saying is the
beloved of the gods and of more than
one mortal, by the way. We hear peo
ple on every side lausrh at old fash
ions and old ideas, but our grand
mothers were taught better than to
deliberately laugh in a friend's face,
or to gaze at them in that defiant. I
don't-belleve-you sort of fashion that
Is such a part of the girl of to-day.
Her sweet face framed in its queer
bobbing curls never looked as though
her head had been put on backward
and her eyes didn't travel serenely up
and down a guest from her head to
her toes either, while her tongue was
bidding her welcome. Xo. Grand
mother's manners may have been old
fashioned, but somehow there was
something irresistibly sweet about
them and the girl In this age and
generation who can improve on them
is little short of a wonder. Showing
true sympathy and sweetness . is the
truest way that any one, either chil
dren or grown folks, can show their
good manners.
in this line apply yourself diligently
to the study of sympathy. Put your
self out to do a kind act or to say a
kind word to help brighten the lives
of all people less fortunate than your
self, for sympathy is a healing, sooth
ing balm that is most acceptable, no
matter what station in life one walks
in.
If you really want to improve your
self study the art of repose and kind
ness. Everything springs from these
two source*. Bv cultivating repose
you will never be flurried or hurried,
and fully nine-tenths 6t all the blun
ders that are made are the result of a
grand rush to make up time. Again,
there is something: peculiarly restful
about a restful girl. She is quiet and
one naturally seeks her when one is
worried or fretful or not feeling ex
actly fit. There is no danger of her
being up and all over the place at
once and of giving one absolutely no
peace, for the same placid repose that
attracts in the first place holds on the
home stretch and long alter the race,
has bepn won.
After von have learned everything
Of course he is not accountable for
his physical deformity and every one
that glances his way does not do it
in a spirit of meanness. But surprise,
curiosity and even pity compel people
to turn about and stare after him as
he goes on his way with burning eyes.
Just why people do not look at him
and then turn away is more than I can
quite fathom. Yet he has told me that
about one person in every hundred can
successfully control the face and look
at him fairly and squarely without in
dicating in any way that the defect
has been noticed.
That is one reason why I say that
good manners are a condition of the
heart. It is not the outward polish
that really counts half as much as the
inward gentility of the heart. Half
the women who pride themselves on
their social training have not a third
of the true kindness that many a hod
carrier, toiling'all day in his old red
thirt and faded overall*, exhibits as a
matter of course.
/""^r OOD manners are a condition of
J / the heart. Perhaps the lassie
WT who wrote and asked how she
V^ could "have good manners" may
not think so at first, but I want her to
look about and select some girl who
has had every advantage in the way of
schooling. She may be polished and
pleasant, and ehe may know which
fork to use and which one to let alone,
hut remember this â she may have re
ceived ever so fine a '"finishing" educa
tion at EOT.e smart boarding-school,
but if she has not been taught kindness
of heart in childhood she will never
have really g'ood manners.
The girl who uses her eyes is the one
who learns quickly. She sees all that is
pcjng on and then quietly makes the
most of her observations. She watches
the way seme well-gx>wned woman
handles her elbows when she sits at the
table, and with a keenness that comes
in a remarkably short time learns to
Judjre and to criticize, first her own
manners or lack of them, and later
these of the people who chance to be
about her.
But scrutinizing people closely is en
tirely different from staring insolently.
And how many burning heartaches this
selfsame staring has caused.
For instance, take it to yourself.
Every time any one glances insistently
in your direction you draw into your
6hell and Kit and brood and fret and
inwardly wonder what branch of eti
quette you have outraged. The more
you worry the more conscious you get,
until one burning wave succeeds an
other in scurrying over your face, and
you devoutly wish you were any place
under the shining sun but just there.
That is a heartache and a heartache
with a vengeance, too. for nothing cuts
quite so cruelly or so quickly as a
curious stare and a half smothered
laugh. Even the bravest man wilts
ar.d takes to the tall timbers Just as
fast as his legs can carry him when
he realizes that the finger of ridicule
has been pointed at him. A regiment
of soldiers with bayonets all pointed
his way would not fease him half as
much as three or four mocking faces
and tell-tale laughing eyes.
I know of one chap whose life is a
perfect nightmare to him. And It Is
made so- by nothing more or less than
common, every-day staring, or, as the
boys so aptly put it, "rubbering." ' He
has a very prominent birthmark on his
face and it is the curse of his life.
Every day as he travels about tending
to his business he fees that fiaming
rÂ»?d mirrored in a dozen eyes and he
is conscious that every one's gaze is
centered upon him as he walks down
the street.

than buffalo and softer. ,: And it can be

Baby calf skin is a fur that is worn
a great deal. It is very fashionable
this year, but how long it will hold its
own no one knows. It is, as its hame
suggests, made of calf skin with the
markings of the calf all showing. They
are brown and white arid red with the

ten, dyed skunk, blended fox and
muskrat. The latter is being treated
in precisely the same manner as the
English moleskins and can be detect
ed by the eye of an expert, so clever is
the deception.
The costlier furs are sable, . ermine,
mink, broad tail, lynx, silver fox and
brown marten. And when buying these
furs you can pay any price you please.
There is' no limit to the sum you can
si-end. â¢ t
In the striped furs, such as Bengal

Just one coat.
While a fur coat is a fur coat and
you can't put it entirely out of fashion,
still it is a fact and a sad one that the
styles in furs have changed very de
cidedly during the past season.' A
standard little fur Jacket is always in
good taste, but, when it comes to ab
solute smartness, there are other
things to be considered. The plain,
neat little fur coat, shaped like a blazer
coat, but buttoned down the front
tightly, from chin to belt, will always
be Jn style, but one looks for something
more elaborate in furs this season.

belt, where it was fastened tightly
under a clasp. Of course the open
throat revealed a very ' smart shirt

And among- the cheaper fursâ yet so

cannot tell the differenceâ baum-mar-
But for a woman with money a good
set of furs is an excellent investment.
One is sure of being always elegantly
dressed, and almost any gown can be
made to look nice.
Ermine conies in the thousands for a
fur necklace and a handsome muff;
and there are certain kinds of ermine
that cannot be bought at any price.
And sable can be got at prices ranging
so far upward that one would have to
g-et a telescope to study the price mark.
The best of gilver fox and the finest of
squirrel a're also very costly and there
is no gauging the limit of baby land,
for the younger and the finer It- is the
higher it goes in price. â¢
Yet the best furs pay in the long run,
for they can be worn forever. And,
since furs never go out of style, and
never wear out. It pays one'to buy the
veiy best one can afford. '
Still, the woman who Is dressing well
oi; a little can make, a very nice show
ing on the cheaper' furs- There are
furs that look very much like Persian
lumb and there are other furs that look
so much like sable that it would take
an expert fo tell the difference. 4 In the
expensive furs there are the old stand
ards and the very new novelties.
Excellent Fur Imitations.
It costs about $20 a season to keep a
handsome set of furs in repair, to store
them and to renew their dye and their
freshness, and if to this is added the
cost of remodeling them, season by
season, the priec will be $20 more.
A set of this kind is as carefully
cared for as a baby. It is looked after
all the year around and is regarded as
a family treasure. Like lace and Jew
els, it is an investment. Rich furs are
put with the furrier in summer; they
are insured against fire and burglary,
and they are taken out once a month
end carefully searched for insects. In
the fall they are brought out, reno
vated and remodeled.

Stocks clasped with metal buckles,
belts buckled low around the waist,
strips of fur outlining vest and bolero
and bands of fur around the skirtâ all
these are among the frivolities of the
season.
Nor was this all. for there were fur
strips to be put around the top of a
high-crowned hat, and there were strips
of fur. for the neck and for the belt.
Fur belts are the latest freak of Dame
Fashion, and one of her swellest devo
tees went down Fifth avenue the other
day wearing a wide belt of sable â al
most wide enough to be a girdle â
fastened in the front with a big buckle
of gun metal.
But in the top of the trunk lay the
fur furbelows. There was a long white
stole of cloth edged with marabout;
there was a perfectly round fur collar
precisely like the old-fashioned fur col
lars made of ermine, with a border of
ermine tails; there was a long fluffy
fox, which was sirrer on the edge but
brown underneath, and there was a fur
boa made of long black fur, very large
around in shape and slightly flattened.
And there vtere two or three trifles in
little flat fur neck pieces, to be worn
with any blouse or coat.
In the bottom of the trunk lay a
great long auto cloak of cloth lined
with cheap fur and bordered with sa
ble. Then there was a little short,
smart coat of deerskin, loose and cut
like a pajama coat. And still another
fur coat lay in the trunk, this one a
coat of Persian Iamb abundantly
trimmed as to neck and cuffs with
Persian embroidery. It was a partic
ularly smart coat with its lining of
gun metal satin and its wonderfully
gay collar and cuffs.
There come many fur trifles which
might be called furs and furbelows.
"One trunk," said a New York wom
an, packing for a journey North, "is
for my. furs and furbelows. It takes
a trunk to hold them."
Then there are wonderful fichus mad*
of strips of velvet and fur all cun
ningly sewed together. Nothing could
be smarter than these j and nothing
more effective in carrying out a dress
scheme. A boa or neck trimming of
this kind is easily made by any woman,
for it requires nothing more than a
knowledge of how to sew fur and this
is something that dan be readily ac
quired by any one with a taste for
needlework.
The fur Ascots are more worn than
ever, but this season one can. buy them
tied. They are long and narrow and
shaped like an Ascot necktie. They
can be worn with or without a scarf
pin. The pin must be very large to be
effective and the prettiest Ascots are
made of ermine, mink, Persian lamb
and chinchilla, none of them, cheap
furs.
It is seldom that the English give
us pointers on how to dress, yet there
are some little fads that are very Eng
lish and very pretty. The English, for
instance, are wearing wide velvet
stoles' made out of red velvet and
green velvet. They are more like
boas, for they go around the neck and
hang down in front. . They are called
velvet necklaces. And as a finish,
there is a border of fur. The very
narrowest band of Persian lamb, or of
sable, or of a silver fox is placed
around the edge and upon the ends
there hang long tails. This "neck
lace" Is worn with a smashing big
muff to match. - . '
A ribbon decoration that is finding
favor with smart dr -ssers is the little
silk shoulder cane, edged with a wide
silk ruffle, or with a series of three ruf
fles. Another pretty trimming shows
a ribbon embroidery outlined upon a
little shoulder cape of cloth. And still
another has a triple row of silk ribbon
ruffles around the sleeves. And In this
connection it can be stated that there
are slesves that consist cf these three
ribbon ruffles and nothing else, for the
sleeves are cut off at the elbow.
The ribbon flower is as popular as
ever. Violets, roses and chrysanthe
mums are made of ribbon and are re
produced so naturally that one Is de
ceived by them. The ribbon violets are.
particularly pretty and are worn in big
bunches upon the front of the corsage.
The big pink" silk ribbon rose, scented,
with a chiffon center, is one of the
prettiest of bodice and coiffure trim
mings.
Fashions From England.
A very charming ribbon trimming
consists of a series of pretty bows, all
connected by links of ribbon, and ter
minating in two wide ribbon ends. This
trimming can be arranged down the
front of a three-quarter coat or it can
be used upon ths front of a blouse. It
is one oi the neatest of ribbon trim

"The Common Lot" narrates the
story of a young Chicago architect's
obsession to the power of greed and
the lures of social ostentation. It is a
keen, ci/ld study of the blighting In
fluences of the insane struggle after
the world's goods in which the half of
our men of business are absorbed. The
development of the plot is done with
such restraint that nothing forced or
unnatural intrudes to- hurry on a
climax or cast shadow on a denoue
ment. Bo natural seems the succession
of steps by which the man in the story
lets slip his hold upon integrity and
so sequential the incidents of his down
ward career that one reading must
pause to reflect that here is life photo
graphed in high lightâ a literary nega
tive untuned and untouched.
Jackson Hart is a vigorous and am
bitious young man, who has returned
from a course in the Beaux Arts to
begin the exercise of his profession in
Chicago, confident that the wealthy
uncle upon whose bounty he had been
educated would leave him an inheri
tance sufficient to insure speedy pros
perity. The will of the dead uncle
awards the young architect only a
nominal sum and, disgruntled, he im
mediately determines to win to opu
lence by the lines of least resistance.
The favor of a wealthy woman here
and the exertion of Influence there
serve to set Hart's feet upon the road
to success and quickly he marries. But
his pleasures are the pleasures of the
rich, his aspirations, are those of the
gilded few. Finding his income in
sufficient for his growing ' needs, the
architect enters upon a shady contract
with a builder and makes a "deal"'
which will net him thousands. . Still
social needa press. and again a "deal."
Bllnde'd'by the glitter of success. Hart
becomes oblivious to" the! love of home
and of honor. Piling dollar upon dol

aspiration until the tragic destruction
Among those who have been most
successful in this endeavor at an In
terpretation of the sociological and
moral effects of the present day trade
strife is Robert Herrick, whose books,
"The Web of Life." "The Real World"
and "The Gospel of Freedom,"- notably,
have all been t aimed at a study of
modern life under the industrial condi

etory. "The Pit," there have. been

"Blazed Trail Stories" is the title
of. a book of Stewart Edward White's
fugitive, tales of lumber camp and
Western reaches that have been col
lected from the magazines in which
they first saw print. Some of them
appeared as far back as 1899, when
the author of "Conjuror's House" and
"The Silent Places" was yet a fledgling
In the writers' ranks; it is not a mat
ter of very great difficulty to pick out
these early efforts from those of later
inspiration. One of these, "The Girl
in Red," occupies the last place in
the book â a sure mark of editorial
discretion. Had it been left out al
together neither Mr. White nor the
reader would have been the loeer.
In his tales of the Great West the
writer has not such a sure grip upon
the atmosphere of his locale as he
shows in the stories of the forest
lumber camps. With the noteworthy
exception of "The Two . Cartridges,"
which details how one Alfred was "a
Sheriff first and an Injun-flghter af
terward." ' the seven stories of the
West have a more or less amateurish
setting of properties. The lumber
camp tales, on the other hand, are ex
cellent; they, have a dramatic in
tensity of incident and a vigorous
portrayal of character, immensely
fascinating Â¦ both. The ' story, "The

remorse and dejection the broken man
Is led back to right living and doing
by the hand of his wife, once neglected."
â¢x A, grim picture of Chicago manners
and Chicago morals Is this that' Her
rick . gives. The atmosphere of the
whole story Is that of the unscrupulous,
unquestioning rich. The . "successful
men" and "successful women" . that
move through Its pages are those
counting results only and taking no
thought of means. The character of
Mrs. Phillips, a woman compounded of
vulgar, ostentation and transplanted
French morals,' Is forbidding but ad
mirably well done. Her world of cyni
cal self-gratification and supreme self
ishness is not pleasant to look upon as
Herrick depicts it. Mrs. Phillips*
daughter, Venetia, a young woman who
would like to be a "sport" and "a
good fellow," Is another strongly drawn
character. In her the author has em
bodied the familiar attributes of that
class, of society that depends upon new
and untoward amusement to sate Its
jaded taste.
A strong, unvarnished tale of city
life is this; a 'tale which catches the
epic significance of the din of dollars
which sounds to the exclusion of every
softer strain In our present day ex
istence.

ten "Off the Highway." A novel t ol
manners it is,- delicately done.
All of the Important characters in the
story save two, good old Mr. Caven
dish and his wife, are city people, more
or less transplanted to the free air of
the; country. San Francisco manners
Vnd San Francisco spirit are made to
blossom under the radiant sun of the
Sierra . foothills. From the balmy air
of the. red gulches "the scenes shift to
this fog-ridden city and back again.
The tilling of a prune orchard and the
filling of a pulpit In one of the city s
largest- churches share Importance
equally In the plot's development And
about all. of these accessories there is
entwined the story of two lovesâ loves
which have the proverbial devious road
to traverse before all Is happy.
The mistake all ; hangs upon Mr.
Drake Wllmot's unfortunate blunder as
to the identity of the sobbing figure
he finds hjding beneath the. folds of
a long cloak with tartan lining upon
the hillside near the Madrono Cross-
Ing ranch. If it was Marlon Whiting,
who was thus giving up to' grief after
meeting with a mysterious stranger,
then there is no use for Mr. Wilmofs
big brother to continue his persistent
suit in that direction. Upon being di
rectly confronted with the question
Marlon Whiting does the natural fem
inine thing, she equivocates and hides,
all unknowingly, the secret of pretty
Agatha Cavendish. Agatha, In turn.

for a solution of the whole crux. Ine
briety and insurance play the part of
master key to the unlocking of the
mystery- !
A sketchy outline of a sketchy plot,
this. The real charm of the story
lies in the author's delineation of her
characters. The : brothers Wilmot are
not remarkable save In the stern de
termination to . do or die which seems
to be inbred with equal strength in
each. It is. upon the two women and
the old man of the story that Mrs.
Smith expends her best work. Marlon
and Agatha are distinct types of lov
able womanhood, vigorous in their per
sonalities. They show, aptly the widely
divergent attitudes often taken by men
and women toward the same phase of
human problems. In Stephen Caven
dish, the God-fearing old clergyman,
unconscious of self and pledged al-
. ways' to duty where duty calls, ' Mrs-
Smith has created a strong character,
though one almost Idyllic. The lesson
this old man teaches in' self-efface
ment and stern hewing to the line: of
righteousness would alone repay a
reading of this novel even were there
no other, attractions.

STRENGTH
In HerricK's Novel
of Buddhism. When this philosophy
found its way from China to Japan
in its very early history it lightened
the stern austerity of the primintlve
belief with gentler precepts leading to
a worship o f the beautiful in life.'
Architecture, painting, sculpture, en
graving, landscape gardening, . even,
all followed in the train, of the new
teaching. With careful modifications
the Chinese religious polity was graft
ed upon the older social structure un
til, as Hearn avers, "the marks of the
welding, the lines of the Juncture, al
most totally disappeared."
In tracing the effect had upon the
Japanese people by the sudden as
sumption of a Western civilization up
on this firmly rooted base of tradition.
Hearn has /ears for Japan's future.
A break with ancient ethical . custom
will be fraught tvith disaster, for upon
that is the nationality of modern
Japan established. Because from her
accepted traditions Japan cannot as-,
sume the great weight of modern In
dustrialism without a turning: away
from old Ideals, the author believes
that in making such assumption she
has encountered dangers whose
menace yet hangs heavy.
The writer closes his book with a
bitter fling at the arrogance of the
Christianising propaganda as it is now
being pushed in Japan. A sudden
break on the part of. the whole peo
ple from the traditional scheme of an
cestor worship is, according to Hearn,
something beyond possibility. Here
is .the writer's opinion baldly put:
"Perhaps this book, in spite of
many shortcomings, will not fail to
convince some thoughtful. persons that
the constitution of Far- Eastern"* so
ciety presents insuperable obstacles to
the propaganda of .Western religion,
as hitherto conducted;, that these ob
stacles now demand, more than at any
previous epoch, the .most careful and
humane consideration, and that the
further needless maintenance, of an
uncompromising .attitude toward
them can result. in nothing but evil."
(The Macmillan Company, New
York; price $20
"The old law, the law of the dead.
is that by which the million? prefer
to act and think." This law, Hearn
shows to be a force old as the world
itself. Before Greece heard the epic
cor.gs of Homer and when Home's
seven hSlls bore virgin forest the race
of which we are sprung was bound
by this law of the dead. The western
nations have outgrown this primitive
Jurisdiction; Japan still yields to It
with a fealty undimlnished. From
the worship of ancestors sprung
Shinto, the earliest and the strongest
of Japan's religious philosophies.
"It should be recognized," writes
Hearn. "that no religion is more sin
cere, r.o faith more touching than this
domestic worship, which regards the
dead ae continuing to form a part of
the household life, and needing still
the affection and the respect of their
children and kindred. Originating in
those dim a^es when fear was
stronger than love â when the wish to
please the ghosts of the departed must
have been chiefly inspired by dread
of their angerâ the' cult at 'last de
veloped into a religion of affection;
and this it yet remain?'."
Minute and searching is the writer's
analysis of the all-pervading influence
of .Shinto upon life and thought.
The early feudal division into family
groups sprang directly from the
hierarchical classification of divinities;
the whole conception of family rela
tion was an outcome of the recogni
tion of the seniority of* ancestors; the
discipline of the race was self-imposed
under the dictates of Shinto beliefs;
the social laws and amenities of polite
Intercourse were developed from
severe religious mandates. To the
ethical and sociological influences of
Shinto was added the esthetic leaven
The attitude of the Japanese mind in
Its very manifestation is. thinks Hearn,
due directly to the Impulses of religion.
Like the people of India with their
castes, and the natives of China, pos
sessed of the tremendous conservatism
of religious philosophy, the whole psy
chology of Japanese character is deter
mined by the force of the two great
religious creeds that have been oper
ating in the island kingdom since the
dawn of time. Despite the suddenly
acquired veneer of the new civilization
which Japan hae put on within the
last half-century, the influences of the
centuries gone lie beneath, and accord
ing to the author these influences are
naught but the manifold expression of
religious spirit. So the author believes
that to solve the mystery of Japanese
character we must trace the spiritual
growth of the people. In Shlntolsm and
Buddhism, the two great religious
schemes which divide the thought of
the people, lies the key to a right in
terpretation of their character.
The near approach to the very es
sence of Japanese life and character
which Hearn had enjoyed for eighteen
years previous to his death was calcu
lated certainly to give his estimate of
these things the measure of authority.
A naturalized subject of the Mikado
t\ as he. head of the department of Eng
lish literature at the Imperial Univer
sity and the husband of a Japanese
lady. As previous works show, Hearn
was the intimate of many of Japan's
leading spirits, he took an active part
in the literary and artistic activities of
his circle, and as nearly as it was pos
sible for one of the West to do he be
came in spirit and thought Japanese.
We may believe, then, that there have
been few that have had his opportu
nity to lift for even a little the veil of
Oriental thought and custom which
cloaks the Japanese in mystery inex
plicable to us.
In an effort to demonstrate how diffi
cult it is for one of Caucasian birth to
make any headway in estimating Japa
nese character Hearn sets forth at the
very beginning of his book the total
difference between the psychological
processes of the Occidental and the Ori
ental mind. "The whole of the Japa
nese mental superstructure," says the
writer, "evolves into forms having
nothing In common with Western psy
chological development; the expression
of thought becomes regulated and the
expression of emotion Inhibited in ways
that bewilder and astound."

C C fl I ir * tation -" the : posthumbus
â¢ â¢ I work of the ; late Laf cadio
I Hearn, deserves to be ranked;
J among the most noteworthy,
publication* of the year. Here
in the author has devoted twenty-two
chapters to a careful psychological
analysis of the Japanese racial charac
teristics, the origin of the same and
their various manifestation ill the art,
religion and social phenomena of the
country. Though Hearn had established
himself as an idealist in matters Japa
nese by his previous works on the land
of the chrysanthemum, in the writing
of this book he chose to strip aside all
mantles of the romantic and idyllic and
to make his estimate of the Japanese
people one founded strictly upon scien
tific exposition. He has produced as a
result of this attitude what is probably
a more nearly authentic appreciation of
the many eubtletles of the Mikado's
people than any yet attempted by an
Occidental.

ROME. Nov. 12.â Brief accounts ap
pear in the American papers Just at
hand of the dramatic career of the
washerwoman, Rosalie Montmaeson,
whose husband became Premier of
Italy. But since her death many de
tails have come to light which are
worth adding to the record of one of
the most extraordinary women of our
day.
It was when Francesco Crispi was in
prison in Turin in 1S53 because Austria
considered him in a measure responsi
ble for the abortive rising in Lombardy
that he first caught sight of Rosalie
Montmasson as she went to and fro
before his cell, she being a washwoman
to the prison. Admiration soon turned
to passion, which endured through pri
vations and storm and stress, but
broke down in the more trying days
of prosperity. Rosalie Montmasson
made history, loved, fought and suffer
ed, and then, like Crispi, made the mis
take of living too long. In later days
she often eaid, "Would that I had died
then, when I was loved and was of
use."
A*, the time she met Crispi in the Tu
rin prison, Rosalie was about â¢ 20 and
a perfect example of the best Italian
type, tall and graceful, with the color
of a blush rose in her cheeks, and a
pair of large, dark, changing eyes,
which produced a. thrill in the most
indifferent breast when she chose to
return glance for glance.
Crispi. When released, was almost im
mediately exiled, so the pair, without a
cent in their pockets, but, with "love in
their hearts and a happy defiance of
poverty, sailed for Malta, : where the
girl was obliged to sing in the streets
to gain a few pennies before they could
have their first meal on foreign soil.
Then followed the sweetest days of
their romance.
THEIR* STRANGE MARRIAGE.
Criaui and RoaaJta caxuuoir&d'taz&iJhar
The next step In the young wife's ca
reer had London as its background.
Here she joined her husband, conspir
acy being their business, and the earn
ing of enough money to eat a mere
detail, which, however, often obtruded
itself In a most disconcerting way. Her
chief duty was to carry letters from
one conspirator to another, often be
tween ; London and, Paris, on which
'hung the fate of more; than one brave
' ifM**"' natrint. It* waa in these days
Crippi seems to have had a con
science, so he decided that a marriage
service should be performed before he
left. Many and anxious were the con
ferences; marriages cost money, and
that was just what they lacked, but on
the point of Crispi's departure.' when
poor Rosalie had given up all hope, a
wandering priest turned up, who, for
a glass of wine, gave his- services,
while a ring was borrowed for the oc
casion and returned at once. â¢
Was he really a, priest? That is a
question being asked here in Rome
after more than fifty years have pass
ed. However that may be, Rosalie had
no doubts, and knelt on the pillow
taken from the bed with the same con
fidence as she would have felt in
church, accepted her borrowed ring
with the same fervor as though it had
been her own, and left that poor room
firmly convinced, as was Crispi himself
at that time, that she was a wife, a
conviction from which she never re
ceded.
HEROINE ON BATTLEFIELD.
wlth the other refugees, as poor as
themselves, and between times the for
mer gave lessons in languages, and the
latter washed. But the idyl was only
too short. Crispi was expelled from
Malta, and through the kindness of a
friend was given passage to Paris, but
Rosalie was left behind until her com
panion coula send her money for th^
journey.
These days passed, the cause . was
won, and her husband was- one of those
who set about the 'task of 'making, of
the new state ;a great- power. Here
was his chance and he seized lâ¬ Honors
and riches" followed.- and the ' clever Si-
Only once did she fail. .Some volun
teers had shown weakness and she was
rallying them when she saw her hus
band, from whose Â¦ side she was only
absent when duty called her elsewhere,
waver and then disappear. With a
scream' she plunged through the maze
of .men and horses and found Crispi
unconscious. She, picked him up in her
arms and fought her way to the rear,
while bullets whizzed past, and she
stopped occasionally to shoot an enemy
who she thought was- coming too
near. ; For this brave deed she was
decorated ' by Garibaldi himself* who
impulsively taking from ! his breast
one ' of ; his own medals, pinned It ; on
hers, saying:' "If all my soldiers were
like you, I should have an army before
â¢\vjilch : nothing could stand."
DECORATED BY GARIBALDI.
that jealousy shouldered perfect confi
dence out of the way. Rosalie brought
about - her- men as â¢' moths -to - a flame.
Crispi liked women's society, . and
neither was content to give full liberty
to the other.
But this unsatisfactory state of
things was ended for the time by Cris
pi's return to Italy. He took part In
the famous expedition of the "Thou
sand," having Rosalie ever at his side.
Here was where her real character
came out. Dressed in the red Gari
baldian shirt, with -a short gray-blue
skirt, rifle in one .hand and bandages
in the other, she was the true goddess
of war, the idol of the soldiers, and the
confidante of the officers. She fought
with the best of them, comforted the
dying, gave courage to the j wavering,
and performed such marvels of bravery
that she was four times decorated.
i Rosalie is generally alluded to as
Crispi's first wife, but she was not.
At 19. he- was already married. "While
a student at; Palermo he met on the
s^air of .his lodging-house a pretty girl,
Rosina Sciarra, crying over Â£. letter.
He then and there . fell in love and
became furiously jealous of his sup
posed rival, the writer of the letter,
who proved to be her brother. They
eventually exchanged vows. Two years
after the marriage found Crispi a
widower, his child-wife having died in
childbirth, together- with her infant. Â¦
She voluntarily gave her consent to a
separation, but when she was asked
to acknowledge that her marriage was
a sham, she stoutly refused. Alas!
where were the witnesses, the priest,
the proofs? So she was obliged to suffer
the humiliation of being repudiatedâ
because her husband desired to marry
again.

The n*t result, it is expected, will

the days of his youth will not hold

By way of recreation he will be com

According to the system laid down
for the unfortunate Humbert, Prince
of Piedmont, his own natural tastes
and inclinations will be the last things
taken into account in conducting him
along the royal road of learning. The
more he dislikes a study, the harder
he will have to work at it. He will
have to sleep in a room In which there
is no fire even in ' midwinter. At 6
o'clock he will have to turn out of his
bed and take a cold bath. At 7 o'clock
he will be given a plain and frugal
breakfast and his lessons will begin
half an hour later.
These, It is stated, will be specially
selected, not so much with a view to
stocking his juvenile mind with useful

LONDON. Nor. 12.â That little Ital
ian baby, whose birth the other day
occasioned such an outburst of national
rejoicing, is likely to have good cause
to wish, before he g^ets many years
older, that he had been born a plain,
ordisary baby Instead of the heir to a
throne. It has been decided by his
parents, after consultation with sundry
w1eÂ« and learned men, that he is to
receive a Spartan education, and that

LONDON, Nov. 12.â Sport will know
but little of Viscount Deerhur9t in fu
ture. Since the" recent turf scandal,
in which Sir James Duke and "Bob"
Sevier were involved, the Viscount has.
been seen less at his favorite sporting
haunts. It will be remembered that his
name came prominently before the
public in connection with that case,
but' While he came out of the matter
with perfectly clean hands, it caused
much annoyance and anxiety to the
Viscountess that he should have been
mixed up in such a scandal at all.
After she had received the sympathy
of her friends, who recognize in her one
of the finest and noblest specimens of
womanhood that America has given to
the British peerage, she Implored the
Viscount to renounce everything per
taining to gambling.
It was hard for a young sporting
Lord in whose patrician blood there
runs a natural predilection for horse
flesh to comply with so sweeping a re
quest, and the friends who know him
best could not for a moment believe
that he would do so.
Little by little, however, he com
menced to show that he was a more
dutiful husband than his sporting ao
qualntances understood. The clubs
commenced to miss him; he was not
seen so frequently on the racecourse
and lastly the parasites who live on
sporting noblemen began to inquire
what had happened to his Lordship.
Bridge parties at which he was always
a prominent figure he j also deserted.
Now his sporting activities are confined
to a few dollars on some Important
race when he fancies a friend's horse.

But coincident with the European
recognition of the new note in art
out here on the ocean's edge come
rasping* and croakings and hissings
from among the high priests In the lo
cal temple of art strangely out of tune
with the divine apprenticeship each
artist seeks to serve. In short and,
in the parlance of the West, the
"knocker" Is not unknown e'en In the
elysian world of Idealism, where the
gross, the sordid and the Jealous
hideous word, green and slimy are
thought to hold no place. But alack!
and alas! Leaping upward now and
then, like a tongue of flame from Pe
lee, comes a blast from the nether na
ture of an artist to scorch the name
and effort of a fellow worker.
And with ahame be it said! For it
ing to the fore the story the
artist would tell â and behold spon
taneity and Individuality in the tell
ing. That is the note that the art
centers of Europe are harkening
unto and that they proclaim â and not
in timorous whispers â to mean an in
fusion of a new spirit into the world's
work in art. Then a health to our
California artistsâ many of whom felt
the thrill and the throb of their art

Yesterday afternoon Maynard Dixon

Of distinct personalities, these two art
ists present distinct types of work â
one complementary to the otherâ and
both are types worth knowing, the
men and their work.
Dlxon's "Prayer" is as holy a thing
as an old mission. A solitary, figure
standing against a limitless expanse of
sky, with a limitless waste of desert
stretching far to -the east and west,
with hands outstretched to the Great
Spirit for succor in a supreme moment,
it is an epic. And in techniqueâ but

has perfected moonlight, the sil
very wrap of earth, but moonlight Is
not of Peters' makingâ nor does he
think so, nor does any painter worthy
of his art. He has reduced it to can
vas so you may bathe in It, dream In
It â even grow foolish in It, so true is
the mystic spell. But any other son
of man with like cleverness is at liberty
to do the same â but he hasn't, as yet.
Nevertheless the moonlight, the oaks,
the sunsets, the glistening sand dunes,
the flowers that grow â all these, and
everything that is â are for those. who
see them. His ability to portray them
on canvas Is the* only distinction that
any artist may honestly claim.
Then the devil bear away the "knock
ers" â those within the land of Bohemia
â 'tis no place for them.
As to honest and kindly and liberal
criticism that is another story. For
that, any true seeker for the higher
development is amply grateful when
given in the spirit of helpfulness. Hon
est criticism is the pruning knife of
all human endeavor, but in the hands
of an unskillful or a designing manip
ulator the most promising offshoots
and buds are ofttimes lopped off.
In my little studio chats I am not a
little amused at the ''art of appropria
tion" indulged in â apparently without
consciousness â by some of our very
best brush-poets. Says one, "There,
see that fellow over there â he's copying
my oaks, my deep somber lights and
my sunsets.' Now, what do you think
of a fellow who will do that?" â Just
as if God, the Good Giver, had issued to
him a patent on the oaks and somber
lights and sunsets. Or you will hear
"that fellow over there is doing moon
lights. Now, moonlights belong to Pet
ers." Ah! such an absurdity! To such a
poet-painter as Charles Rello Peters, I
doubt not that such a limitation would

God's children who see and hear and
feelâ that the world should look for
the highest Idealism in living. But
the fact remains that t there are In San
Francisco men who tarnish their own
good names by scoffing and unworth
ily criticizing the honest, and earnest
efforts of men and women who have
not yet caught the world's eye, but
who are fast "arriving" despite the
heavy handicap of the scorn of their
fellows.
Throughout the week Miss Maren
Froelich has been holding "open house"

The Tilden statue that James D.
Phelan presented to San Francisco,
typical of the native son, Is perhaps
the best known bit of art work of the
West. Its l^erolc poise, beckoning as
it does the great East to follow, the
sun's course, toward the West, has
made it symbolic of Western progress.
It figured on the cover of Charles Sedff

away at St. Louis. And thus is our
art becoming an integral part of San

"We are supposed to Kendallze the
profession in America," Mrs. Roberts
enlarged. "We always travel together,

Miss Williams is a wonder."
I mentioned Ibsen then, as I re
membered that Mr. Roberts had ap
peared in the only American produc
tion of "Rosmersholm," produced last
spring. Mr. Roberts jabbed down the
property cigar he was lighting, and
Mrs. Roberts gently interpolated that
her husband was "anti-any cult, in
fact, naturally forninst."
Mr. Roberts then objected to the
Ibsen fashion of making "his char
acters pick their teeth with sequoias
and cry thunderstorms." Nor did he
think the plays were essentially dra
matic, the lines of thought being too
simple and. obvious. He instanced
"The Joy of Living" as an ideally dra
matic play, three or four crossing
threads of thought continually in play.
"In Ibsen,' he said, "one person thinks
and the other sits and sees him think.
He chews the thing on one side, then
turns it over and chews the other, then
back again and over again â why, they
could do all that backing and filling
in one act easy!"
Mrs. Roberts flung in the apologetic
suggestion that perhaps the Ibsen
reading they were going in for next
summer might change his mind. He
didn't think it would.

But Mr. Roberts certainly looks some
kind of genius. Alter his great height
and breadthâ the former of which has
prevented his appearance in the "legit
imate" drama â one immediately notes
the burning, brilliant eyes, clear as a
child's, fiery brown as to color, some
times restless, sometimes again in
tensely concentrated in gaze. He has
the Inquisitive nose, bridged hawk
fashion and pointed, and the long chin
of the searcher. Add a head that takes
a 7U hat â '"made to measure," as the
actor laughed over to me as he put
it on to return to the stageâ and you
have other presumptive evidence of
unusual capacities.
It wag Mrs. Roberts that told me
what direction these had taken, as her
husband went back to the mimic elec
tioneering of the stage. She told me
first that it was from Captain Roberts,
a well-known figure in earlier San
Francisco history, that Mr. Roberts in
herited his inventive genius. The coal
screens still used along the water front
testify to Roberts' pere's creative fac
ulty-
'â¢Our house." Mrs. Roberts began,
laughingâ "this reads charmingly for
publication â bears witness in every
corner to Mr. Roberts' inventive ca
pacity. He really is a genius that way.
We have bookcases, chiffoniers, shelves
âshelves to the right of you, shelves to
the left of youâ everything in the car
pentering line. But oh! the shavings
end the smells and the noise! I often
wonder what the neighbors think.
Last spring Mr. Roberts was working
on a bottle that could be smashed over
Uncle Tom's head by Legree and that
would hold water. He made one all
right. It is a compound of tar and
shellac and shivers Into fragments Just
like real glass. But the smell and the
smoke we had! And then Mr. Roberts
thinks nothing in the heat of invention
of takingâ as he didâ an old silver tea
pot, an heirloom, to pour out the tar!"
I offered sympathy and asked for
more.
ks like an actor and you don't."
Big, bluff, in the linen vest and
dragged coat of J!m Hackler in "The
County Chairman." the actor stood
there, mopping no stage dew from his
great brow. It was election night and
he had Just been reading the returns.
He gave a final swab with the Hackler
red handkerchief and said, after greet
ing me: "It's a landslide for Roose
veltâno flght. The people are not in
terested in the returns any more. Par
ker had no more show than I had."
As he patched then at the Jointure
of wig and brow, somewhat disturbed
by the excitement, he laughed: "This
wig was copied after Bryan'sâ they say
we look somewhat alike. Do you see
It?"
"No." I said, "I think Mr. Bryan
Mrs. Roberts told roe that "inter
viewers generally found that she could
give them points." She can. The one
trouble is that the vastness of the
material rather induces despair. Page
after page I scribbled down, of witty
c^id interesting conjugal comment, and
am utterly embarrassed by choice
amor.g it. Suffice to say that if Mrs
Roberts ever turns biographer for one
of the oddest and most original char
acters that ever trod the stage there
will be a book worth reading.
Mrs. Theodore Roberts should know
and me Â«ays that Mr. Theodore Roberta
is "an actor in his leisure time and an
Inventor when he is at work." This is
sot the only thing Mrs. Roberts told
me about Mr. Roberts. I went to see
Mr. Roberts the other night behind the
scenes and found the dressing-room
full of Robertses, the tremendous six
feet one and a half of the actor, the
comely five feet something of Mrs.
Roberts and stilJ more Roberts, for Mr.
Roberts is a native son and owns much
kin here.
George Ade of. course came up after
that, and interesting in the extreme
was Mr. Roberts' little sketch of the
dramatist, gentle, retiring, kindness it
self, and much liked among men. His
dislike of the theatrical the actor
phrased thus: "Ade has a fit at any
thing like theatricalism. He was con
tinually down on overemphasis â no
dotting the 'I' of a joke. And Mr. Sav
age is wholly with him. Savage says:
"We're banking on Ade's humor, and if
the audience can't get it wlthcmt your
flinging it at them they must go with
out it. You Just play the author and
never mind advertising the actor.'
And that's what we are trying to do.
Then again, as you were kind enough
to say this morningâ (and I want to
say that San Francisco â and I'm
proud of it, I know they know a good
thing when . they see it â is the only
city where there has been not the
slightest adverse criticism) â our com
pany is not a 'No. 2' company. I don't
think there is $250 a week difference
in the salary list between ours and the
original company. Also, in some In
stances I think the company playing
here Is* even better than the one at
Wallack's."
"The little milliner and the drum
mer," I surmised hastily, and he
nodded. "I am desolee to have for-
Keffron in "Cleopatra," the Indian in
"The Girl I Left Behind Me," and his
part in "Arizona," in which Mr. Rob
erts made such a hit In London, were
instanced as among: his favorite roles;
end of his part in "The County Chair
man," after acknowledging that he
liked It greatly, the actor said it was
one of the very few roles in which he
appeared without much make upâ "got
a cold, in fact, from taking it off."
Mr. Roberts came into this with: "I
never could 'play* lovers," with a ten
der glance wifeward.
Then Joh.i began to speak for him
self. It was in old Magulre's day at
the California that the actor made his
debut. In shrewd and humorous fash
ion he described him, the manager who
had no c-mce"t>ut the sidewalk in front
of the theater. v *
"I went to him the day after I made
my debut," recounted me actor, his
eyes glinting merrily, "fully expecting
that Tom would give me the lead the
following week. But all he said, and
I shall never forget itâ remember, I
was very thin thenâ was this: 'Can't
you keep your heels in and not stand
like a pair of cc-mpasses?' "
Regretfully he tc-ld me then that his
height had prevented his appearance in
the "legitimate" drama, but of how it
had been useful in his eight years' en
gagement with Fanny Davenport.
Femininely Mrs. Roberts elucidated
that "Miss Davenport was a wise as
well as large woman, who knew that
large men made her look more girlish
by contrast."
How Mr. Roberts gilded the kitchen
rocker, wj.b planning to clear the New
York streets of snow by heating them,
how Mrs. Roberts had discovered him
as a comedian, how she had prevented
him from playing Romeo and Pygmali
on â for which the American stage
should be grateful â and so on, busily
occupied the time until the actor re
turned. Mre. Roberts was just saying:
"He never could play lovers."
With an attempt at archness I asked:
"What! never?"
'â¢But Mr. Roberts is so rabidly loyal
that he wouldn't kill even a flea that
was Californlan," his wife laughed.
"This engagement Is a great pleasure
to him. you know. He thinks of it as
Just fun, as a boy who is going to
speak a piece for his mother. Mrs.
Roberts is out in front to-night and It
is the prettiest picture to see them

The Twentieth Century Club is quitÂ©
evidantly doing the work it set out to
do, and doing it in very thorough fash-
Ion.
the "Wohin" and "Ungeduld" of
Schubert and the "Ich LJeb* Olch" of
Beethoven, one heard another singer
of admirable taste and sympathy. Very
interesting again was the performance
of the Corelli sonata in G minor (op.
5). played in spirited and discreet fash
ion by Mrs. Gwynn and Mra.
Hengstler. Its clever pianoforte score,
constructed upon the original bass by
Henry Holmes, was a feature of In
terest. Mrs. Alice Bacon Washington
contributed a thoughtful and unaf
fected reading of the Bach prelude and
fugue In C sharp minor and tha
Brahms intermezzo (op. 117).
It is late to acknowledge the pleas
ure â the rare pleasure â that the last
programme of the Twentieth Century
Club gave me, but perhaps tardy grat
itude is better than none. The club
some two weeks ago gave Its first pro
gramme of the season, and it was of
those peculiarly happy ones that just
seem to happen sometimes. They
should happen frequently with the
Twentieth Century Club. Not only
does the club contain the executive ma
terial, but it offers that sensitive, sym
pathetically exacting ear to the artist
that /impels himâ compels himâ to his
best effort It is a truly delightful au
dience. You play to it as to yourself.
Nay, more high heartedly. For in the
light of a sympathy for which nothing
is of too curious or intimate appeal
the player finds new beauties in his
best known and best loved works.
For example. Not having heard Miss
Caroline Little sing before for the
Twentieth Century Club, I never heard
her sing at all as she sang in the
Beethoven liederkreis, "An die Feme
Geliebte." In fact I did not know that
she could ring that way. She brought
an arch and joyous lightness to the
"Fair Maytime," a tenderness and
sympathy to the "Take My Songs,
of Love the Flower," of which her
work, asÂ» I had before known it, gave
little evidence. Tlie cycle throughout
was sung with an admirable simplicity
and directness and with a variety of
emotional shading that inhibited any
hint of monotonyâ no small feat..;;.
The bÂ«*st thing of the afternoon, how
ever, was the ballad singing of Mrs.
Richard Bayne, who gave the four
Scotch songs of Beethoven, "The Love
ly Lass of Inverness," "Bonnie Laddie.
Highland Laddie." "Oh. Thou Art the
Lad of My Heart, Willie." and "Faith
ful Johnnie." .Rare material this, and
it was rarely Interpreted. I believe
Mrs. Bayne haa a charming contralto
voice, and I am sure it has been well
trained; but so utterly beyond these
things was the spirit that informed her
singing that I hardly know. Scotch it
was, pre-eminently â as . Scotch as the
breath of heather across a moor. It
Â¦was austerely tender as the Scotch
skies and simple, strong, wholesome
And melancholy gay as the people un
der them â the people around whom the
songs are written. How well Mrs.
Bayne sang that day as compared with
herself I do not know, not having
heard her before^ but one could hard
ly wish for better ballad singing. The
songs were given as written, with vio
lin and 'cello obligato, the assisting
musicians beins Miss Vassault. Mrs.
Gwynn and Miss Fuhrer, who all
played well their parts.

tee*of the Board of Supervisors, yester
day made an official Inspection of the
district designated In the proposed or
dinance requiring that when roofs are
damaged to the extent of 40 per cent by
fire they shall be repaired with fire
proof material only.
As a result of the Inspection the com
mittee Is preparing a report for pre
'sentation at Monday's meeting of the
board. It will recommend that the 40
per cent clause be eliminated from the
provisions of the ordinance, that the
proposed district be largely reduced and
that the amended ordinance be so
framed as to be made applicable to
new structures only and that existing
buildings be exempted from its require
ments.
The committee found on making its
Investigation that the district proposed
to be designated in the ordinance in
cluded a large area that was thinly
settled. As the houses are generally of
cheap construction the committee be
lieved that it would be an injustice to
compel the use of expensive fire-proof
material In case of damage. Hence . it
was Â¦ deemed proper to reduce -the pro
posed limits, but by how much is a
subject for further consideration.
Again, the committee is opposed to
specifying that fire-proof materials
shall be used if the roof be damaged by
40 per cent, preferring to do away alto*
gether with that requirement
The committee also takes the ground
that it 1 would be practically, extension
of the fire limits to make the ordinance
apply to existing structures, and it was
thought that it would be fair to all par
ties concerned to make new structures
only subject to the new regulations.
.The committee felt that it would be
advisable to go slowly In the matter,
and agreed that the limits could be ex

for colonel and lieutenant colonel, vice
Colonel Thomas F. O'Neill and Lieu
tenant Colonel John F. Connolly,
terms expired. Colonel Hayes of the
Fifth will preside. It was expected
that Major Filmer would be a candi
date for the position of colonel and in
that event Major Thomas F. Mc-
Creagh was to have been put forward
as lieutenant colonel, with John F.
Eggert, the senior captain, as an
aspirant for the position of major.
These plans have been upset In a
measure by the fact that Major Fil
mer has requested to be placed on the
retired list. Since- he made that re
quest he has been asked to be a can
didate for the position of colonel of
the First and his reply waa that un
der no circumstances would he be
colonel of an eight-company regiment,
but that if the regiment was again
made a twelve-company one he would
consider the proposition.

to insure uniformity, all infantry ex

in the new system are prohibited.
Those therein prescribed will be

commanders will be required to pass a
satisfactory examination 'in the new

This paragraph in the orders has
created a breeze among those who
hold commissions. They seem to in
fer that this means if they do not pass
a satisfactory examination they- will
be ousted. They set up the plea that
they were commissioned after having
passed a satisfactory examination and
that under the law they cannot be de
prived of such commission except for
some violation of law, rules or regula
tions that would bring them before
a court-martiaL Many have asked for
information on this point, but no one
has yet been answered. It is possible
that no answer will be given until a
case may arise calling for a decision.

THE Guildhall of Xord Lansdowne, British Foreign Sec
retary, coupled with persistent rumors from London and Paris,
makes it evident that intervention in favor of . arbitration on the
part of two or three of the powers is about. to become a factor in the
: Far Eastern struggle. The Foreign Secretary made broad implica
! tion in his address that it lay. with the .United- States and Great
! Britain, and with France if she would consent to the pact, to offer
direct to the, belligerent nations their good offices in the direction of
bringing to an end the distressing conflict in Manchuria:
â¢ Though the Russian Minister at Washington has repeated with
I emphasis the assertion that his master the Czar would listen to no
j talk of foreign intervention until Russian prestige had been .vindi
! cated, it becomes more; and more evident that the despot at St. Pe
tersburg is only awaiting a good excuse to accept the inevitable with
j honor. Nicholas stands between two fires ; his professed regard for
i the interests of the Hague arbitration court, of which he was in a
sense the father, and the care he must exercise for the honor, the
stability even, of his throne. He knows that Russia is beaten and hi
is desirous only of taking* as small a dose of the corrective medicine
! as he can circumspectly submit to..
i In this offer of intervention the United States through Presi
; dent Roosevelt is almost the controlling factor. England and France
! are mutually checked and balanced by their respective alliances with
! the warring powers, but our country has the virtue of absolute disin
1 terestedness. The President's, recent call for the reassembling of
The Hague tribunal is indicative of the free hand and the guiding in
fluence which he, as representative ofthe nation, enjoys. That; act
j drew upon him the reliance of England in the-matter of-the initiative
for the arbitration, movement. It is to v be hoped that President
Roosevelt can see his way clear to assuming ? the lead in this act of
pre-eminenthumanitarianism. â¢ ,

sounds of loud singing and exhorting
in- the edifice and they hastened
thither. ' .. '.
Mrs. Neth had locked herself in and
shouted:- "This is 'the house of God,

It seems plain then that before dealing with these enlightened
professors of religions older than ours, which rest upon the same
claim of revelation, miracle and supernaturalism, it is necessary to
convert all Christendom first to Christianity. It is necessary to in
duce every Christian to love his neighbor as himself, to love his
enemies and not hate them, and do good to those who do him ill.
When this work is accomplished we may move upon the works of
the other and older religions with every prospect of success.
We desire the foreign missionaries to observe that this state
ment of the case is not inimical to foreign missions. It is friendly
to them. It means that the most effective foreign missionary work
is to be done at home, in preparing Christendom for acceptance as
the model and example which the world can safely follow. , When
that is done the world will follow it willingly. Man is so consti
tuted that he inclines to religion in some form, and as long as that
inclination is unchecked he will do precisely as he does in material
things. He will seek the best that he can find.. By their works ye
shall know them applies to the nations of Christendom as well as
to the rest of the world. .
If the missionaries think there is no work; to be done at home
to make Christendom a fit example to the world, let. them reacl the
newspapers published in this country, and by the information gained
A DEVOTED gentleman in Oakland, who proposes to go among
the heathen as a Christian missionary, has invited correspond
ence on the question of foreign missions, pro* and con. This is
an excellent plan for disclosing the lay idea of the missionary effort
among the millions who hold the religious idea in a different form.
There has always been a difference of opinion on the subject, and
the adverse opinion has been increasing during the last fifty years.
The heathen themselves have some very positive and enlightened
ideas about it. We say enlightened, because very many of the Asiatic
proponents of Buddhism, Shintoism and Confucianism have received
the Occidental education, in the great universities of Europe and
the United States, and bring to bear upon the question of compara
tive religions the rules of logic and investigation which the Christian
philosophers use upon them. These educated believers in the re
ligions of Asia naturally resent being classified with* the fetich wor
shipers of Africa and the bushmen of Australia, and therein seems
to be the key to the missionary situation.
They desire to be judged by the effect of the religious idea upon
the common, daily life and conduct of the people. They claim
the right to be judged by the effect of their religion upon the best
of them and not the worst. They visit this country and find in the
slums of our great cities conditions that are not outdone in squalor
and vice by the slums of Canton or Calcutta. On the other hand they
find here in a different social grade the same graces of life, the same
consideration for the weak, the same charity and gentleness that are
among the Parsees of Bombay, the Brahmins of Agra, the Bud
dhists of Ceylon, and the followers of Confucius in China arid the
Shintoists of Japan. While we may differ from their conclusions, we
cannot dispute their right to conclude that their forms of religion
and ours are excellent, if they are lived, or made the guide of moral
conduct. If our missionaries could show throughout Christendom
the universal influence of their religion, carried into the conduct of
all the people and. into the "policy of all governments nominally Chris
tian, they would have all the argument on their side.
FOREIGN MISSIONARIES.
for the christianizing of the world. We think this states the case of
the laymen who fail to be enthusiastic over foreign missions, and it
may deserve the attention of churchmen. >
j peoples to whom our missionaries go. They are observed and com
i mented upon and remembered. There are many laymen who believe
i that all the money and effort 1 put into foreign missions should be
spent upon the reform of conditions at home. There are good and
J earnest Christians who think that some man .who towers above his
| fellows should raise a banner of light inscribed with the legend
| "Christianize Christendom" as the first and most needed preparation
j in that way measure their duty. Let any daily paper published in our
j great cities be used for the purpose of keeping the statistics of juve
j nile crime and transgression. Let the revelations of a year be col
i leered for the purpose of study. A gentleman who has kept such
! statistics for six months finds them to reveal such conditions among

The task before the South is to prove to the country that the
negro can bo deprived of the ballot and retain his freedom. If he
is not only deprived of the ballot, but is regarded as an outlaw
when a white man under the same circumstances of crime and guilt
is protected in his right of a jury trial and legal sentence, it is diffi
cult to see how his lapse into slavery is to be prevented. One section
of the constitution is as easily violated as another. The security
of the negro's freedom is no greater than the security of his citizen
ship arid his right of self-government by his own ballot.
This is all plain to Judge Jones, and it is evidently his desire
to put up the judicial safeguards of the Federal courts, to prevent
a return of chattel slavery, by making the negro equal before the
law which white men make and administer. We are not yet in re
ceipt of the opinions of the Southern press, if indeed the}' have ex
pressed any upon this attitude of the court. We are sure, however,
that it will immediately interest the thoughtful element of that sec
tion who do not believe that the riotous and violent minds of Till
man and Vardaman should be taken by the North as expressive of
Southern sentiment.
Much may be counted on from the influence of Judge Jones, who
is a leading citizen of his State, and served a number of terms as its
Governor. The Southern leaders who are philosophical in their view
of the race problem deplore the effect upon the whites of the con
dition of the negroes, and, above all things, desire to avoid the ener
vating effects upon their own race of the civil and mdustrial sub
jection of the other. Judge Jones has raised a new issue and
brought in sight a new remedy. How will the South take it?
ludge I ones has already dealt in his course with one of the
consequences of denying to the negro the equal protection of the
law. As he intimates, the result will be the subjection of the race
and the practical nullification of the thirteenth amendment, by which
slavery was abolished. This has already occurred in Alabama, where
negroes have been found, held in actual chattel slavery now, in de
fiance of the constitution. The master has been punished upon con
viction in his own court. It is a vast problem. In its solution will
emancipation be reversed.
JUDGE JOXES of the United States Court for the Northern
District of Alabama is a Southern Democrat and an en
lightened jurist. He holds pronounced views upon the duty
of the Federal Government to protect its citizens at home as well
as abroad. He believes that the Federal courts have jurisdiction to
punish lynchers when negroes are their victims, and if his view
obtain in the South mobs will be less ready with torch and rope.
In a charge to the* Grand Jury in h;s court recently he said:
"Perhaps as good a test as any other in arriving at a just conclusion
is to ask yourselves, considering what was said and done by the
mob. would a white man under the same circumstances, charged
with the particular offense upon the same victim, have been at
tacked or murdered by this mob? If you. are fairly satisfied that
the mob would not have murdered Maples if he had been a white
man, then every dictate of humanity and justice demands that you
return true bills against the members of the mob.
*Hc reached this conclusion and asserted Federal jurisdiction
because the constitution requires that all citizens of the United
States have equal protection of the laws of the State where they
live. The Judge continued: "Whatever may be said of any other
murder or of any offense against a member of the race, there can
be no room for doubt when a member of that former slavi 1 race is
taken by members of another race out of the hands of the State
which is endeavoring to secure for him the enjoyment of the; right of
trial by jury, which its laws accord to all men under accusation of
crime, and is pvt 10 death by a mob because^ of his race to prevent
his having a trial according to the law of the land, that the intent
and inevitable eiTect of such an act is to destroy the victim's en
joyment of freedom and equality of civil rights 'because of the race
to which he belongs, and sooner or later reduce the negro to the
condition of a subject race.
"1 he white race is superior and wields the power of government.
The negro has practically no part in it. The laws arc made by
white men. White men preside in the courts. White men sit on the
juries. The danger is not thai a guilty negro will escape just pun
ishment at the hands of the law. but that in many instances the in
nocent may meet with unjust punishment. The pretext that the
criminal will not receive justice if the law is allowed to take its
course is wholly wanting."

Since they were fellow church-workers,
It would not do to say Miss Catherwood
hated Margery, but ever since young
Warwick had fallen under Margery's
spell, the elder lady had shown herself
spiteful beyond words.
All Eppington laughed at herâ of
course, covertly. She was in a way
its great lady, owning the biggest
house, the handsomest grounds, and
nearly the biggest bank account in
the village. Young Warwick's uncle,
the Major, had a thought more ready
money, but since he lived modestly,
never subscribed to anythingâ in pub
lic â and gave away by stealth more
than half his income, he was no such
personage as Miss Callierwood, whose
joy in life was to write her name in
front of a good round sum, at the head
and forefront of every important list.
Margery said audaciously that it was
Miss Catherwood's habit to let both
hands know all that even her little
finger did. Possibly it was that speech,
with the necessary accretions from
mouth to mouth, which first made Ep
pington's Lady Bountiful, so high and
haughty toward its prettiest girl.
Margery Lane was easily that â and
much more. There was a sweet soul
at the bottom of her velvet eyes, wit
and spirit a-plenty under^ her mop
of floss-silk curls. All the finest young
fellows of the village were her chums
and sworn champions â even |to the
two or three who had tried to be
something more. Margery's compell
ing gayety shed sentiment as a duck's
wing sheds water. Thus she had
laughed her would-be swains out of
sighing into a consciousness of what
she persisted in calling their mistakes.
When sh,e had fully persuaded them to
take her own saen view she sent them
rejoicing on the way to court and
marry other girls.
Thus, in her own way. she was
easily as much a power as Miss Cath
erwood. Otherwise, she would not
have been what she was at the fair.
MisSv Catherwood was the fair's mov
ing spirit. If she had dared she
would have ignored Margery. Since
she did not dare she wisely resolved
to make the utmost possible out of
her enemy. Consequently Margery
had the stall which dispensed impar
tially randy, cut flowers and literature.
The girl's chums had behaved nobly
in the matter of buying, to say noth
ing of her lovers, actual, possible and
imposible. Major Warwick put him
self at the head of the impossible,
vowing things were at a pretty pass,
indeed, when the girl he had brought
up specially for himself was whisked
away from him all in a wink by his
scapegoat of a nephew.
Melville Warwick, the nephew, had
been Miss Catherwood's protege since
he was in short frocks, this in spite ot
his own smoldering rebellion. His
mother, a gentle half invalid, was de
voted to Pamela Catherwood, and
Melville never willfully crossed his
mother in' anything.' He had worn
Catherwood leading strings with what
grace he might up to the day he was
sent away to college. When he came
back from it to find tomboy Margery

a life for a .life. You thought only of
your enemy, but you saved your friend
as well. If the fire had gained head

"I'm not trying to -pay. you, Mar

depths of her easy chair: "Butâ you

passion. This sublime state of man
is to have attained to Right Actions,
the fourth step of the Path.
The fifth stage of the "Eightfold
Path" is Right Means of Livelihood.
Accustomed to the Right Actions
one's life will grow purer and clearer,
and then his action in dailv life, even
eating, walking or sleeping, shall
naturally accord with the highest laws
of nature. Ascending from all con
ditions which cause pain and sorrow,
we may live only by those means
that produce spiritual calmness and
serenity. This state of attainment is
said to be Right Means of Livehood,
the fifth step of the Path.
The sixth stage of the "Eightfold
Path" is Right Energy.
By living and training in this wav,
one may conquer his mind and he
will have capacity to use his energy
to manifest the strong power of his
will. This state of attainment is said
to be Right Energy, the sixth step
of the Path.
The seventh stage of the "Eightfold
Path" is Right Mindfulness.
As the strong willpower is gained
in the sixth step, so may he learn
to concentrate all his thoughts and
hojcl upon a special object, always
keeping holy things in mind. This
state is said to be Right Mindfulness,
the seventh step of the Path.
The eight stage of the "Eightfold
Path" is Right State of a Pure Mind.
By this holy transcendental ability
we can constantly think on holy
things, and our mind will- be entirely
peaceful. This is Right State of a
Peaceful Mind, the eighth or the last
step of the Path. This state of man

LL"\ OVE brothers." This \i
r, the noble teaching of the
B Western sage. "Com
[Â¦ y passion to all men with
out distinction of rank,
rationality and color." This is the
precious instruction of the Oriental
'Â»-ache.r. Social virtue, so much
spoken for scores of year?, comes
from the same motive as taught by
the wise men of the Orient and the
Occident, , Of course, social virtue
stands 'parallel with personal virtue,
but at present, the former is much
more in view than the latter. As
we Â«e in various administrations of
public organization, town, city, State
or country, every decent and patriotic
citizen is more or less sacrificing his
own profit and happiness for the bet
terment of the society where he lives.
All good men and women have been
crying' out for the improvement of
society and their endeavors alreadv
have brought social organizations to
a better condition, and I am sure
that they can lift it to the higher
plane of life, nearer, indeed, to the
ideal.'
: There are many people respected
in society as being good self-sacrific
ing men on account of their contribu
tion to the social works, though these
same men have committed horrible
"^ins in the background. On the con
trary, many individuals, perfect in
their personal virtue, are thrown into
darkness in society, on account of
their inability to stand forth as lead
ers in the social work. These strange
phenomena are seen everywhere in
Asia, Europe and America. If these
injustices will be tolerated without
being rectified then cleverly masked
men, so ill-willed in their hearts, will
continue to gain distinguished posi
tions in that society which thev must
eventually degrade. They are like
counterfeit coins.' -Their looks mav
deceive us for a time, but the time
will come sooner or later when their
baseness shall.be exoosed. Though
the ma^k of the wicked man mav be
dragged down by the people he will
already have effected ruiri. desolation
and disgrace in sanctified circles.
To prevent this kind of corruption
of society -by wicked misleaders we.
must choose men not only for their
ability but primarily for their personal
virtues.
Society is an aggregate of thou
sands of individuals, and the social
will must have its foundation on the
will of each individual person. If we
desire a society perfect in virtue we
should at first improve the moral will
of each individual.
A classical text of Oriental ethics
says: "Pure heart renders one's mind
honest. Honest- mind constitutes
good personality. Good personality
forms happy home. Haoov home
constructs comfortable town. Com
fortable town brings about peaceful
State or country." So a man of im
pure heart brings misery to his hoWe.
A dishonest administrator will de
stroy his social organization with him
at its head. In political affairs, if
we elect a man of ill-will to a high
and representative position he may
ruin the country.
One can speak love in his lips, and
write compassion with his pen, but
we should never choose man by his
lips or pen only. Eloquence of ora
tors may conceal their faultB. and
beautiful articles of a writer can
illuminate over the darkness of
his heart. Eloquent speech is noth
ing unless it comes from out oi. the
sincere heart. A thousand pages of
flowery articles arc as nothing if the
writer lacks purity of motive. We
should choose men of patriotism, men
of pure will and good personality
for administrators and lawmakers â
men who will promote the spiritual
happiness of society and mankind.
Allegorically speaking, the human
mind is like a glittering- sparkle of a
lighthouse on the coast. The sparkle
"may, g,u,ide many, ships in the far dis
tant points oh the sea, vet we have
complete darkness at the foot of the
lighthouse. In- the same analogy, it
is easy to criticize others while the
darkness is>around ourselves. In or
der to bring the glittering sparkle
home to ourselves we should reflect,
comprehend and improve ourselves
according to the instructions of the
best teachers.
Some wise men of the West have
taught us their doctrine of the* middle
way as the standard of virtue. .The
greatest Oriental teacher also taught
his disciples "The Middle Path," or
the middle course of a' virtuous life.
This was summed gp in eight prin
ciples or parts, and therefore called
the "Noble Eightfold Path."
The first stage of the Noble Eight
fold Path is Right Comprehension.
We must at first comprehend char
acter of all life in the world. Three
woesâ old age. disease and death â
are for all living creatures. Once
born in the world none can pass
the barriers of these three sorrows.
One may content himself for a
while by ignoring the distress of his
fellow man or even blinding himself
to his own future. But such self
satisfaction arises from ignorance.
But is ignorance not a sorrow? Al
most all religions, ancient and mod
ern, or Eastern and Western, have
been founded upon the idea of sor
row or evils of the world. Without
this idea of sorrow alL religions in the
world would have lost their existence.
Next we must comprehend transi
toriness of all life: Everything on
the "earth, depends upon the principle
of transition. Men. animals, plants,
or even stones, having once come out
to the world of life, must perish or
decompose sooner or later. Then we
understand the meaning of transitori
ness quite well. Next we must com
prehend absence of immortal self.
This is very hard for Western minds
to understand, for their mode of
thought is quite different from the
Eastern. â¢ .Usually we sav: "I am."
Â¦'my property," and so forth. This
I-ness, or self, is not immortal, but
is commonly thought to be so. All
quarrels emanate from this selfhood.
In reality, there is no immortal ego
istic-self. Thus, when we rightly
comprehend sorrow, transitoriness
and the non-self of all life, we attain
to Right Comprehension, or the first
step of the Path.
The second stage of the "Noble
Eightfold Path" is Right Aims.
When we see anything suffer we
feel pitifully, we compassionate and
resolve to expel our own ill-will and
give succor to the needv. If this
motive of our aims be sincere and
genuine we have attained to the Right
Aims, the second step of the Path.
\ The third stage of- the "Eiehtfold
Path" is Right Speech.
tf a man's motive is pure and true
he will not conceal the truth, nor
will he seek secrecy, nor will he
speak unkindly to the people, but
his words will be always mild and
fair. Realizing love and comnassion
in his speech he is said to have at
tained to Right SpeechT the third step
of the Path. WfV
The fourth stage of the "Eightfold
Path" is Right Actions.
By understanding the woes of life
and. also bearing the feeling of pity,
every phase of our conduct will sure-

CCl ft. THOMAS BALLIET of
\ Nen York University in a
H recent addrcfF defined the J
M r<\\ idea of education. Its j
mott significant characterise ;
tic, he. declared, was the in- :
creased love a!:d respect fur children, j
They art- row bting studied scientifi- i
cally Â£.r.d sympathetically from Â¦ the [
standpoint of psychology and medicine r
and the sympathetic standpoint of the
mother and tearher. The' change in
lh* ideals of education is also marked.
Whereas the former aim of teaching '.
to promote the acquisition of ;
knowledge, the main object now is to
acquire ability to think, the power to :
use- the mind and to crasp new prob- '
'ems. The theory does not permit. the
rating of a student's capacity by his
classroom marks or his standing upon
the day cf his Kraduation.
In the educational uplift, which has
lately come to ','hicago. there Is promi
nent ni*nti;.n ' Â«tf that important per
eonage â the Jdca: teacher. It is a hope- 1
ful sign that in that city and in many
other places large attention 4s being
given to. the personality and work 'of
teachers. This plainly announces that
the idea that anybody will do for a
teacher is passing; that there is a
wider recognition of the Importance of
the instructor's work and that stronger
efforts are being made to bring to that
vork persons w,ho are mentally and
moraily fitted for it. In the course of
an address delivered before a hundred
young women, who are to teach In
the rural districts surrounding Chicago,
Principal J. W. Cook of the Northern
Illinois Normal . School recently said
that the ideal teacher must possess
youth and beauty; and then, when
some of his auditors still regarded J)im
in dismay, 'he hastened to add that he
referred to youth of spirit and, beauty
of expression. A' teacher with these
dualities will have the greatest in-
Suence with her pupils and it will be
persistent and wholesomei Another
speaker Insisted that the ideal teacher
must be possessed of a heaping meas
ure of common" eense â the splendid
quality of adapting oneself to circurh-.
stances, of mastering a . situation, no
matter wliat obstacles it presents. '
"The teaching of current events Is
on* of the best- signs of the century.
I And for this teaching nothing is. so
j valuable as the newspaper. We all
j know that a large proportion of the
{boys and girls of this land do not go
I to college. To those who enter upon!
1 a business career. It is of immense J
â¢ importance that they have . good ;
; understanding of this form of daily
! literature. We are not sure that they
j will keep on with Plato, but we do
j know that they will all read the news
i papers. Every American citizen does.
i What we, as teachers, must do, then,
is to teach our children, to read them
intelligently." â¢' . ;
With these and other earnest words,
j Robert E. Thompson, principal of the
Central High School of Philadelphia j
and a lecurtrer of wide reputation, re- j
cently addresse-1 the annual meeting of j
the New England Association of Col
leges upon the part that newspapers
j take in educational development. The
I speaker/while claiming an unmeasured
influence for great newspapers, also ;
â¢ laid stress upon the importance, of in- '
struction to scholars how they should'
be read. He would have . the civics,
teacher encourage his class Â¦ to ask all j
manner of questions on -topics of the
day and would have the scholars learn j
to see causes In criticizing human mo
tives and to study nations and people
from their own point of view. .'
California teachers are anticipating a I
treat in the rich programme of the
State Teachers' Association to be heid
at San Jose, December 26 to 30 inclu
siveJ Dr. Edwin A: Alderman, presi-.
dent of the University of Virginia, will,
make three addresses on, respectively.
"The Negro Problem," "Childhood in
Civilization" and "The Spirit of the
South," giving to the last-named sub-,
ject a national treatment.
Jacob A. Riis, the enthusiastic Dane- J
American, will discuss "What Is It 1
that Makes - True Americans?" and !
William H. . Mills will speak on ."Our

f A wondrous ' success with a school j
garden has been Â¦Â¦ realized Â¦ this season !
by- Public School No.; 4. in New. York 1
City. This school is ' unique in its j
composition, probably no other like it
exists in this country. It Is located
in the densely populated district at the
corner of Rivington and Ridge streets
and has an enrollment of 2100 scholars,
every one of whom are believed to be
of Jewish parentage.
So narrow are their environments
that, incredible as it may seem, 1000
only of; these \ j children â¢ acknowledge
that they have seen a tree. The out
look for nature study by children with
such limited horizons seemed to be"
hopeless. But, fortunately, only :a
block; away the annex of. this school
was condemned by the board of health
and was torn down." Part of the va
cant space was bare land. Such an
opportunity' was not to be lost. The
little plat >vas divided among the forty
ni ne eager j classes and farming was
begun on a miniature scale. At any
time during the day a teacher was
allowed to take her class into the
grounds f or :, fifteen : minutes _ if they
were not then occupied. One class
raised ' grass, ' others vegetables and
flowers. 1VJ1 - were closely watched
throughout the season with an inten
sity of which a prairie "farmer knows
nothing. Aside from the : pride of the
scholars in the crops realized the effect
of this nature work was wonderful
upon these children of the city. Their
perceptions were quickened, geography
had a more tangible meaning when
wheat, corn and hay were discussed as
part of the wealth of the country and
an unsuspected tenderness of spirit was
evoked through the language of flow
ers. Such a rich experience through
one summer's experiment has hitherto
been unknown in New York.
Lady Henry Somerset' of England,
whose frequent visits to the United
States in beha!f of philanthropic inter
ests have ' afforded an" extensive out
look, has lately -.'expressed her opinion
of the public school system in "this
country. She acknowledges the surprise
felt by an English woman on her first
visit to a great public school In Amer
ica on account of the commingling of
i.11 classes of the community. Favor
able comment Is made upon co-educa
tion, upon the social standing given to
teachers," which is unknown in Eng
land, the school methods seem to her
1 ." be* admirable, the flying of the flag
and the national songs sung are ap
proved, while the teaching of civics,
reinforced by practical lessons through
miniature town meetings are boards
of Aldermen, win her unqualified com
mendation. Lady Somerset asserts
thnt one of the great secrets of the
American woman's influence la to be
found in the fact that she is Infinitely
better educated than the average En
glish woman.
At the main works of the General
Electric Company in Schenectady. i N.
Y., a large number of young men are
employed. Arrangements *'are being
made .by the co-operation of the engi
neers of the company with the City
Board of Education to establish an
electrical night school, to have a two
year course of study, varied by occa
sional lectures. Rooms. will be fur
nished by the school authorities and
a fee of $10 to be paid by the men at
tending the school will defray the
teaching and minor expenses.
It is reported that Bishop Lawrence
of Massachusetts will lead an effort to
raise a fund of J3.000.000 for Harvard
University. Assurances have been
given by leading Harvard alumni
which leave little doubt of the success
of such an endeavor.

The Crowded Mail Dock.
The Manchuria followed by the
Coptic, coming from the Orient, and
mooring at the Pacific Mail Dock has
crowded those wharves with bales and
boxes of merchandise. They are hur
rying to unload the big Manchuria,
get her into the drydock and back
to the wharf where she can load and
leave for Asia next Tuesday. The
Pacific Mail steamship Peru is due
Wednesday from Panama and the
Coptic sails for the Orient Novem

The coast steamer F. A. Kilburn is
tied up at Port Rogers on account
of troubles between the owners of
the vessel and the Marine Engineers'
Union. A week ago three engineers
of the vessel struck, the result of
a misunderstanding with Captain
Thompson of the Kilburn. They filed
charges of mistreatment with Russell
Sc Rogers, the agents of the vessel.
The engineers agreed to work the
steamer back to San Francisco, but
refused lo zo to sea with -Captain
Thompson, and the Engineers' Union
upheld them in this decision. A rep
resentative of the vessel's owners an
nounced yesterday that new engineers
would take charge of the machinery
of the Kilburn. but it was not decided
whether Thompson would sail in com
mand of the steamer or not.

In the list of overdue vessels the Nor
wegian barkKinn, 109 days from Buenos
Ayres to Falmouth, England, is causing
considerable anxiety. The reinsurance
on the vessel has increased from 25 to
40 per cent in one day.
The British ship Troop is ninety-five
days from Manila, bound for St. Helena,
She was last spoken 500 miles from
Hongkong in distress. The vessel is
probably lost.
The Italian ship Shenir is 160 days
from New York for Brisbane and
stands at 5 per cent reinsurance.
The German ship Sirene is 166 days
from Liverpool for Valparaiso, and bo
sure are speculators that she is lost
that her reinsurance has reached 95 per
cent.

The doctor admits that his theory is
apt to be received with incredulity and
amusement, but he asserts that it is
ttrens^hened by the fact that the color
senj"? of the human race was many
thousands of years in reaching its
present stage of development.
"The rays emanating from a very
passionate man have a deep red hue;
one whose keynote in life is to be good
and do good throws off pink rays; the
ambitious man emits orange rays; the
deep thinker, detp blue; the lover of art
and refined surroundings, yellow; an
anxious, depressed person, gray.
"One who leads a low, debased life
throws off muddy brown rays; a de
votional, good-meaning person, light
blue: a progressive-minded one, light
green, and a physically or mentally ill
one, dark green."
LONDON, Nov. 12.â Experiments
numbering over COO. conducted over a
term ci three years, have formed the
subject matter for a communication
from a physician to a well-known med
ical Journal, to the effect that the rays
emitted from the human body differ
in color according to the character and
temperament of the person. The fol
lcwlng particulars are given by the
writer:
I Attorney M. C. Hassett, special pros
ecutor, asked leave to make a state
: ment. He said the complaint had been
sworn to and the defendant arrested on
August 12. The offense was alleged to
have been committed on September 21,
1901, so that the three years' limitation
would not have expired till September
21, 1904. Police Judge Conlan did not
hold the defendant to answer till Octo
ber 12, twenty-one days after the time
had expired. Hassett pointed out that
there were thirty-nine days for the
holding of the preliminary examination
and for the filing of the information,
and If ordinary expedition had been ex
ercised that was ample time. He
thought the matter should be investi
gated.
The Judge said he could not make an.
investigation, but as the Grand Jury
was an appendage of the court it would
be proper for that body to investigate
any alleged' dereliction of duty by any
public official. If the due administra
tion of justice had been interfered
with it would be proper to call the at
tention of the Grand Jury to the facts.
Dr. Brennan was first arrested in
February last on the charge of embez
zling over $36,000 from Rev. Father P.
J. Grey, and was held to answer in
June by Police Judge Fritz. A few
.days later he was released by Judge
Cook on a writ of habeas corpus on the
ground that the charge, if any, should
have been grand larceny. It was not
till August 12 that the complaint charg
ing him with grand larceny was sworn
to before Judge Conlan, and he was
held to answer on October 12. In the
embezzlement complaint the crime was
alleged to have been committed in De
cember, 1903, but in the grand larceny
complaint the time was changed to
September 21, 1901, and when the case
was called in Judge Lawlor's court the
demurrer was interposed.
An application for a writ of habeas
corpus is also pending before Judge
Cook, but it will now be withdrawn.
Dr. Thomas F. Brennan, after a long
and stubborn fight in the criminal courts,
is a free man through somebody's blun
der. Yesterday Judge Lawlor sustained
the demurrer to the Information charg
ing Brennan with grand larceny, and
dismissed the case. The Judge held
that the statute of limitations was a
bar [ to any further proceedings. The
point was raised that the information
was not filed within three years after
the date of the offense.

One of the long overdue vessels, the
French bark Marguerita Dollfus. came
into port yesterday. She Is seventy-one
days from Newcastle, N. S. "W., and
her voyage was one of unfavorable
winds and calms up the Pacific Ocean to
this harbor. She brings 2560 tons of
coal consigned to J. & A. Brown.
The British ship Ardencraig left
Newcastle ten days before the Mar
guerita Dollfus, and though she sailed
in identically the same track as the
latter vessel she has not arrived; nor
lias she been spoken since leaving the
other side. The Chilean bark Andro
meda left Newcastle with the French
bark, but she is still out, and though
the two vessels carry the same amount
of canvas and sailed on the same
course they drew apart, and there is no
telling when the Andromeda will ap
pear. The French bark Rene sailed six
days after the Frenchman and Chilean,
but the date of her arrival cannot even
be forecasted.

B B There are any number of
ft m people who have Varleocele
|fl â people who are unaware
yM cf the fact. A swollen vein
wa In any part of the body is
a:i almost certain sign of
varicocele. And what is
that? It is the disease that
e slips, snore surely than any-
thinjr else, thr- vital force's.
\)o you see the weak â the
emaciated man? If you do
you may be certain that he
suffers from this dreaded
trouble In some form. It
appears in the scrotum.
r _ When it appears there
V^ immediate danger faces
y. you. b^t swollen \eins
anywhere are alwavs a very
n distinct sifrn of WASTE.
I Your system is like a bank
account. You can draw on
Â¦ it at all times, but when it
is is exhausted, what can you
a do"! The man who is nnan-
2 daily |xÂ»or may, by hard
Â¦ work, regain some share of
B the world's poods, but the
Â¦ man who is broken In
health throuph waste has a
hard battle in front of him.
GIf you see any sipn of the
trouble why not "take the
bull by the horns"? Why
not say. "It is not too late"?
Would not that be wisdom?
Thi:.k it over for a minute
or two. I cure Varicocele
by my own methods. I do it
|Mk in a week without the use
kg of a knife. It cannot be
M | cured by any system of
II H home treatment, but I say â
BJ end I stake my professional
reputation on the statement
âthat I CA3T A3TD Z DO
Ccure Varicocele permanently
and promptly. My methods
are the result of CARER7,
AXD CONSCIENTIOUS IN-
VESTIGATION'. I use no
methods that have not been
PROVEN. I never guess; I
never experiment. I take no
ecase where I have the faint-
est doubt about my success.
If your case cannot be cured,
you may be certain that I
will not undertake it.
I CUKE MT PATIENTS.
S In addition to Varicocele,
Â§ I also treat with unvarying
Â¦ success Spermatorrhoea,
Â¦ Diseases cf tiit Prostate
i Gland. Unnatural Losses,

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Prices of Onions were advanced sharply
yesterday, supplies being scanty and the deÂ»
mand brisk, both' for local use and shipping
account. Holders were rather indifferent
about parting with their holdings, even at the
advanced quotatlons-and some were expecting
still higher prices.. The situation' in river Po
tatoes was unchanged, the market still being
overloaded "with ordinary stock. â¢ Fancy 'lots
of Salinas Burbanks did . a little better,- but
there was plenty of common stock available
at easy rates. , 8weets continued j weak, <with
supplies far in excess of the demand.
Tomatoes and Egg Plant were in light re
ceipt and fresh lots cleaned up readily at beti
ter prices, Summer . Squash, and Beans were
steady at the previously quoted rates, while
the other vegetables were generally weak.

The suit under which the decision
was rendered was entitled Mary Floyd
McAdoo vs. M. S. Sayre. Judge of the
Superior Court In Lake County. It
was an application for a writ of pro
hibition to nullify the order of the
Superior Court declaring the. trust
dissolved, argument being made that
a full year had not yet elapsed since
the will was offered for probate. The
Supreme Judges, however, decided
that no action had as yet been taken
and it would be Impossible for them
to antlciDate the action of the lower
courts. The application for the writ
was accordingly denied. Judges Shaw,
McFarland, Van Dyke and Henshaw
concurring and Beatty and Angellotti
dissenting.
The case of Sidney M. Smith vs.
the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works
was remanded to the Superior Court
for retrial. The trial court found that
the Baciflc Vinegrar and Pickle Works
had ratified and approved the in
dorsement, placed upon the notes of
the California PackinR Company by
President Smith and Secretary King.
There was nothing to show that the
directors were aware of this, so the
new trial was ordered.
In the appeal of Thomas 1 W.
Treanor from the judgment of the
lower" court awarding the office of
County Recorder of Santa Clara
County to C. It. Williams, the Su
preme Court upheld the judgment.
According to a decision of the Su
preme Court rendered yesterday the
estate of the late Cora Lyons Floyd,
who married ilitrow Gopcervic, a
street car conductor, may now be dis
tributed to the beneficiaries under her

The * weak and unsettled condition of the
Apple market, which has been mentioned al
most daily of late, was more pronounced than
ever yesterday and .lower prices ruled for
extra and ordinary fancy fruit. â¢' The down
ward movement was started by- handlers of
consigned stock, who were anxious to effect
clearances.' and the other dealers were obliged
to follow suit. Extra fancy Oregon Spltzen
bergs. which had previously been held firm at
$1 60 per box, were offered by one dealer at
$1 25 and he announced that he j would shade
that quotation to large buyers. The lower
prioes stimulated trade somewhat, but retail-'
era were still operating cautiously ln expecta
tion of further declines. Eight straight
carloads, . two from Colorado and the
balance from Oregon, were added to
the already unwieldy stocks. Trade
in other deciduous fruitfl was of fair
volume and prices were steady for everything
except Grapes. The top quotation for Grapes
in crates was obtained only for selected lots
Ruitable for shipping. S5c being the top for
the general run of offerings. Open boxes were
suddenly plentiful and there was a sharp break
ln prices. Berries cleaned up quickly at firmer
prices under the usual extra demand for Sun
day requirements. Citrus and Tropical fruits
were In fair request and all descriptions stood
as previously quoted.

The Italians then started a counter
demonstration on the university steps
and sang the national hymn of Italy.
The Germans attacked the Italians and
drove them from their position. Stick*
and umbrellas were freely used and
many heads were cracked, but no ar
rests were made, as the fighting was
confined to the university precincts.
VIENXA, Nov. 12.â Many heads were
broken in a fierce conflict between Ger
man and Italian students at the uni
versity to-day, the fight arising from
the recent troubles at Innsbruck. The
Germans took the aggressive. They
started singing the -\Vacht Am Rhine"
with uncovered heads and demanded
that ail the others remove their hats.
The Italians. Slavs and other non-
Uermans refused to do so. whereupon
the Teutons forcibly knocked off their
opponents' headgear and trampled
their hats and taps in the dust.

The week closed with Butter ' depressed and
still lower. AH dealers had some complaint
or other, the market being too dull or too
overloaded, and sometimes both.- It Is freely
said that the market was never before in such
congested and bad condition at this time of the
year. Excellent creamery sold, down to 13c
yesterday, and 20c would buy almost anything.
Continued offerings of the large department
stores at 30@31c per square, retail, .aggravate
the demoralization, for the wholesalers have
to follow them down.
Cheese seems on the verge of a decline,
though, there is none yet. ' -
Eggs also closed very weak, with an In
creasing' number of receivers shading quota
tions . to . Bell. Receipts were larger, as will
be seen. Predictions of lower prices this week
were" freely made. *â¢ Stocks of ranch seemed to
be gtting rather, larger, though still small.
Receipts were 21,000 lbs Butter. t>13 cases
Eggs. and 930O lbs Cheese.

Denver. Colo. â¢William Harris, a colored youth, who
stole a pair of shoes from a wagon on
Kearny street, said that he arrived here
a few days ago from Cincinnati, to be
"in at de races."
"Oh, you're a race follower?" re
marked Judge Mogan.
"Not 'zackly, yo Honah," was the re
sponse. "Dat am. Ah means ter say
dat Ah cudn't follah de races befo*
dey begin. Ah've , follahed races, to be
suah, but en dis yah case Ah'm per
cedin' dem."
"Well, they will be a month ahead of
you by the .time you get out of jail,"
said his Honor. :
"Ah'll tryter ketch up wif dem,"-j
grinned Williams.
Chief Wittman has issued instruc
tions to all officers to arrest any per
son or persons violating . the ordi
nance prohibiting poolselling outside
of the race track. Yesterday seven
arrests were made and the defendants
were booked at the City Prison. They
were William Smith, Union Square
avenue; John Brown, Montgomery
street; Harry Thorn, Leidesdorff
street; Joseph Meyers. O'Farrell
street; Charles Rupert, Sutter street;
L. Allen, Ellis street, and William
Bell, O'Farrell street. They were re
leased on bail. /,: ;
Accused of PoolselUnjr.

they be forced to leave San Francisco?
If they are honest and industrious they
w ill find means of earning a livelihood
h*re sooner than they could find it
anywhere else. This is a very good
town for decent boys to get along in.
If those two boys depart from decency
they will quickly be here- again, and
then will be time enough to depot i
them. They are dismissed, and I hope
they will be aided instead of retarded
in their endeavor to obtain work."
The little chaps assured the Judge
that his confidence was not misplaced.
all the, amatory correspondence she
appeared as a victim of chronic im
pecuniosity. Almost every letter sent
by her to him contained an appeal for
pecuniary aid â or, as he orally termed
it, "an attempt to touch." The cums
thus solicited varied from $5 to $115.
Accompanying her request for the lat
ter amount was an alternative. She
wrote from Seattle:
"If you don't send me money to pay
my bill of $115 here I will go to Nome
City with a gentleman who offers to
pay it. But I love you best, honey
dearest, and would prefer to have you
settle it."
On another occasion she wrote from
her home at 2419 San Bruno avenue,
this city:
"Honey Sweetest â The wind is
blowing something fierce and it makes
me think of you. My darling honey,
I would love to see you, and wonder
if you want to see me. You know you
told me that you loved. me. Were you
joshing when you said that? Come
to me, honey sweetest."
The complainant's warm Latin tem
perament found untrammeled ebulli
tion in his messages to the girl and he
used crimson ink. His spelling, how
ever, was hardly less "fierce" than the
wind that made her think of him. Her
age was quoted at 17 years, but she
looked to be in the early twenties. Ha
seemed to be on phe shady side of
40, and his appearance and manner
served to enhance the mystery at
taching to the young woman's pro
fessed infatuation. He is an Italian
restaurateur.
Judge Cabaniss continued the hear
ing till next Saturday, when hand
writing experts will examine the con
tract which the defendant claims to
have no recollection of signing. Her
attorney hints at forgery.
Miss May Adams proved that she
did not participate in the robbery of
John* Collins by Miss Nettie Mason
one night last week on Sixth street,
but ere she could leave Judge Mogan's
courtroom a year-old bench warrant
was flaunted in her face and to-mor
row she will be sentenced on the vag
rancy charge which she eluded a
twelvemonth ago by forfeiting her $10
bail and fleeing to Seattle.
"Well, wouldn't that jar anybody?"
she exclaimed when the bailiff showed
her the antique order of arrest. "Mer
cy 1 ! I think you folks might let by
gones be bygones., I suppose if I'd
stayed away a hundred years I'd be
pinched when I came back. Don't
you folks forget anything?" .â¢
She was still conversing with her
self when the next case was well un
der way. '
Tom Daly not only denied that he
threw rocks at the windows of his
Uncle Patrick'3 residence On the 3$00
block of Folsom street, but averred
that said windows were broken* sev
eral years ago by Uncle Patrick him
self. To which Uncle Patrick retorted
by displaying a number of large
stones, which, he declared, had been
cast into his house through glass that
had been unfractured until that mo
ment. Then the defendant's wife
stood up in court. and. exclaimed that
if any window smashing Was done she
was the person who did it, but the
gospel truth was that Uncle Patrick
had trifled with truth. In her opin
ion Uncle Patrick's penchant for pre
varication was a gitt, as it was too
strong to have .been acquired. It
must have been born with him, she
declared, and thank goodness, it did
not afflict any of his relatives, either
by blood or marriage. The lady was
still speaking when Judge Fritz re
moved a supporting hand from his
forehead and told all the Dalys to go
home.
Miss Aileene Hill, putative daughter
of Melpomene, scored one when 'Â¦ she
caused the arrest and detention of
Tomaso Felepedas on the charge of
vagrancy. She was accused of having
stolen a diamond ring from Romeo
Hale and giving it to Tomaso as a
token of her .undivided affection, and
Tomaso swore that he had never seen
the bauble. .Then she swore to a re
taliative complaint, alleging that
Tomaso was a vagrant and soon after
ward it was whispered to the detec
tive that another search of the apart
ment which had been jointly occupied
by Aileene and Tomaso in the 800
block of Howard street might result
more successfully than the former
quest of the ring. The hint was acted
upon and the ring found in a bureau
drawer. â¢ Romeo will recover his prop
erty, of course,- and-it will remain with
Judge Mogan to decide whether
Aileene is a thief and Tomaso a va
grant. \
-Aileene says that although she re
ceived a thorough training for the
dramatic stage, the short-sighted
managerial policy of the Frohmans
and the Belascos and the Moroscos has
compelled her to confine her his
trionic efforts â¢ to minor theaters,
whose stars are not "featured" as they
would-be In more. pretentious houses.
That and not any lack of acting ability
oij her part is the cause of .. her com
parative obscurity in the profession.
But she has hopes. .
Patrolman . Maloney, whose special
official function Is to prevent human
somnolence in Union Square, bagged
no less than five sleepers in a bunch
last Friday afternoon. When he en
tered the square at Its southeast cor
ner, ho averred, his ears were assailed
by a dissonant chorus of snores and
following the sound it led him to the
northwest corner, where he found the
quintet in unconscious operation. His
catch embraced one jockey, one deck
hand, one horse trainer, one paper
hanger, and one hotel steward â or, at
least those were the vocations claimed
respectively by the defendants. Each
of _ the men entered the same plea â
that he sat down to rest and was lured
to" the hug of Morpheus by the sight
of another person wrapped in slum
ber. Â¦ Judge Mogan vainly endeavored
to ascertain who was the first of the
five to fall asleep and start the infec
tion and then dismissed them all with
a warning.
Roy Brennan and Fred Pulven, 17
year-olds, were arrested as suspicious
characters, but the police failed to con
nect them with any offense more seri
ous than \ that of arriving here as
brakebeam' tramps and having neither
employment nor money, and suggest
ed to Judge Mogan that he order them
to leave the. city. After Interrogating
the lads the Judge declined to adopt
the suggestion.
"I don't see why. these boys should
be compelled to resume tramping." he
said. "They came here from the East
to; find .\ employment, . they. Bay,.. and
their appearance and 1 . manner do 'not
belie their statement. Now, why should
Mr. Parra not . only acknowledged
the once tender attachment alleged by
the young woman, but incidentally
produced' documentary evidence that
proved.it.' In missives written by him
she was playfully addressed as "Van
derbilt" and her saccharine appella
tions for him ranged from "Honey
Sweetest" to "Tikey-Wikey." It was
not because of her material wealth
that he called her "Vanderbilt," for in
Miss* Gladys Freeman's old gold
coiffure was surmounted by a heavily
plumed brown .velvet picture hat as
she sat upon the witness stand in De
partment No. 2 of the Police Court
and declared that Louis Parra of
231 Oak street gave to her for perma
nent keeping the two diamond ear
screws which he subsequently alleged
she had embezzled from him. The
feathers of her headgear were a-flut
ter while she vehemently denied hav
ing willfully -signed a paper purporting
to be a contract pledging her to re
store the jewels to Mr. Parra at any
time he 'should demand themi And
her. white silken shirt waist palpitated
the emotion that possessed her as she
told â¢ of the relationship that once
existed between the complainant and
herself. Her mother, whose severe
black costume and iron gray hair, ac
centuated by contrast the garishness
of the defendant's apparel, also pro
nounced Mr. Parra an unqualified pre
varicator.

From the. report of M. Keeic, th'a

Greece, it appears that the export' trade
from Kalamata.to (he United States is
increasing. M. Keck refers, to'.the large
quantities of currant*. which i are gent
to the United Statos and to the ex
portation of about 140,000 worth of vari
ous kinds pf cheese, and about J7300
worth of hides, as well as the exporta
tion of figs and various, other. articles
(olives, olive oil, and so forth). More
than 7,000,000 pounds of currants were
exported from Kalamata to the United
States In 1903, and M. Keck thinks that
a part of the currants, shipped at Pa
tras came from 1 the Kalamata district.
In speaking ' ofÂ» importation, M. Keck
refers to the quantities of German ar

GOLD MONEY TAKES HANDICAP
The name of one of Sweden's most
distinguished families appears on an
affidavit filed with the Police Commis
sioners yesterday charging "Spider"
Kelly, ' the prize-fighter, with conduct
unbecoming a citizen, and is likely to
result in Kelly forfeiting his license as
a saloon-keeper. The document will be
used by. the police at to-morrow nighfs
meeting of the Commissioners as evi
dence against the prize-fighter, who
will be summoned before that body to
show cause why he should not be de
prived of the privilege o.f conducting a
saloon. Kelly's troubles are the out
growth of an unwarranted attack made
by him early Saturday morning on
Count Nils Bonde of Sweden and one
of the latter's traveling companions,
who have been guests at the Palace
Hotel for several days.
The Count, who is a direct descendant
of one of Sweden's most illustrious
Kings, accompanied by Baron W. A.
son Grebst, a prominent young journal
ist andpoet of Gothenburg, and Chris
Hollingworth, a. scion of one of the
wealthy families of the same city, ar
rived here a few days ago, and under
the guidance of Baron son Grebst, who
has visited San Francisco before, he
and Hollingworth have been enjoying
the sights of the city before and after
dark. Friday night the trio partook of
a late supper at the Techau Tavern and
at its conclusion they started down
Mason street toward Market on their
way to the Palace. They had not pro
ceeded far, however, before they were
suddenly pounced upon by Kelly, who
was drunk and apparently was not
pleased with the gentlemanly appear
ance of the strangers. Without warn
ing Kelly struck the Count a heavy
blow on the arm with a cane, and a
second later he assailed the Baron in a
similar manner.
Then Pdliceman Smith interfered
and the entire party was hurried off to
the City Hall, where Kelly was charged
with â drunk. The policeman wanted to
charge the prize-fighter with assaulting
the Swedes, but the latter persuaded
him to brfrig the milder charge, so that
they might avoid the annoyance of ap
pearing in the Police Court against
Kelly.
Yesterday Kelly while telling his
friends in the tenderloin of his previous
night's experience was suddenly sur
prised by .receiving a summons to'ark
pear before the Police Commissioners
to-morrow night to answer charges
preferred against him. Although the
distinguished visitors from .Sweden
had refused to prosecute Kelly in the
court because they disliked the noto
riety, they were yesterday persuaded
by Caotain of Police Duke to make
an affidavit' regarding Kelly's conduct,
and steps . were at once taken by the
police to prepare a strong* case against
the prize-fighter. -â¢Â¦â¢ â¢-Â¦

No one could be found .who had
seen a madman or any stranger in
the vicinity of the house, or, in fact,
in Auburn on the day of the murder,
so the robbery theory, for a time,
gained a few supporters.
The finding of the money on Weber's
body and in the piano exploded the
remaining theory, and the officers com
menced their search closer at home.
The sequel came to-night in the arrest
of young Weber.
From the outset young Weber inti
mated that he thought the crimes had
been committed either by a madman
or a robber.
to direct suspicion toward the dead,
and thus shield the guilty. If such was
the purpose of the story, it signally
failed, for the autopsy held on Weber's
body showed conclusively that the
wound which caused his death was not
self-inflicted.
The robbery theory was soon aban
doned, for the pockets of the cloth
ing worn by Weber when he met
death contained $100 and in the piano
that was removed from the burning
house by neighbors was found $40. .
The statement published by our Gov
ernment that English enthusiasts are
looking for a future output of gold in
the Transvaal of from $120,000,000 to
J150.000.00Q a year, is stimulating to the
imagination. Just as the realization of
this prediction would be stimulating to
the sDeculation and business of the
world. In the first six months of this
year the output of gold in the Trans

This is at the rate of $76,000,000 for the
year. Last year's production amount
ed to over $61,000,000. The largest pro
duction was in 1S98. being $79,213,000.

In some manner yet unexplained, a

that the elder Weber had on several
occasions quarreled with his wife.
The story undoubtedly was intended

he was becoming angered. His an

When asked to view the bodies of his
dead relatives so that he might supply
the identification required by the law,
he complied in a perfunctory manner.
To all questions asked him by the Cor
oner he gave the shortest answers pos
sible, and the only time that he dis
played any feeling was when one of the
interrogatories implied that he knew
more than he had told to the jurors.
| YOUNG RESIDENT OF PLACER 1
COUNTY ACCUSED OF HAVING
! MURDERED HIS FAMILY.
The courtroom was crowded during
the proceedings and while Adolph was
on the stand a deathlike stillness
"Weber was mainly questioned as to
what he did and how he acted after he
arrived at his home while it was on
fire. He said he was a sufferer from a
weak heart, but that mentally he was
in the full possession of his faculties.
When asked how he could account
for the position of the bodies as they
lay in the burning house, he said he
had no theory to advance.
The first time he showed any emo
tion was when the District Attorney
asked him about going on a recent
coon hunt and who his companions
were. He sharply declined to answer
the question and it was not until Cor
oner Shepard compelled him to do so
that he finally gave the names of the
members of the party. Among those
who accompanied him on the hunt
was Adrian Wills, whose overcoat he
had borrowed for the occasion-
He was then asked if he remarked
when he returned the overcoat: "Well,
I'm going away, and you will never
see me again." He denied having
made any such remark. "When asked
if there had been a pistol in the
pocket he became excited and replied
emphatically "no." He also denied
ever having owned a pistol or having
had one in his possession or any 32
caliber cartridges. He admitted, how
ever, that he had looked at a pistol
in a eun store in Auburn and also
that he had looked at 32 cartridges
at the same time.
Services were first conducted by
Mrs. William Watts, Mrs. J. Manning
and Mrs. Ethel Seavey of - Azalea
Lodge No. 117 of Rebekahs, of which
order Mrs. Weber was a loved mem
ber. The Rev. A- K. Glover of " the
Episcopal church and the Rev. J. P.
McAuley of the Methodist church
also officiated. The tension during the
services was deep and intense and
several of those present were so af
fected that they had 'to be led from
the room. .
When the choir of the Congregational
church rendered several beautiful
â¢hymns those gathered at the biers gave
vent to their feelings in. bursts of tears.
Throughout the touching eremony
young Weber, dry eyed, looked on.
When the services were concluded he
was one of the first to leave the under
taking parlors.
The bodies will be shipped to San
Francisco on an early train! Sunday
morning and interred in Cypress Lawn
Cemetery. . . . i
But: It was not alone at the funeral
services that young Weber aroused ; the
Ill-will of those who heretofore had only
regarded him as an eccentric character.
At the inquest being conducted by
Coroner Shepard to determine who is
guilty of the quadruple murderi Weber
was, if possible, more defiant, cool and
calculating. He did not show the
smallest desire to assist the authorities
in unraveling the mystery and nothing
i was elicited from him that might aid
i The son who had been bereft of
those who should have been most
near and de<tr to him stood as cold
and grim as a piece of marble. To
him these outward, signs of grief did
not appeal. His eyes kept continually
roving around the room and appar
ently his thoughts were wandering
far from the scene of sorrow. May
hap it was that he had before him
another picture â a prison cell and he
then occupant.
The scene in the undertaking estab
lishment was a sad and impressive
one. Three caskets, draped with
snow-white cloth, were arranged in
the back parlor. One contained the
body of the murdered mother, with
her murdered boy clasped in her
arms.
On either side of this casket were
those containing the bodies of her
husband and daughter, who had met
death with her at the hands of the
same cruel, crafty murderer.
IMPRESSIVE SERVICES.
No verdict was brought in and at j
midnight the jury was excused and will
not meet again until Wednesday.
The arrest of young Weber did not
occasion much surprise, as he had inti
mated during the afternoon that he
expected to be taken into custody. Dur- I
ing the course of a conversation with J
The Call correspondent 'VTeber re
marked:
"I know I am under suspicion. If I
am arrested I will talk, but I will not
talk until then."
SHOWS GREAT IXDIFFERENCE.
The indifference and lack of emotion
shown by Weber have prejudiced his
case in the eye3 of the residents of
Placer County. He has not exhibited
the least sorrow for his murdered rela
tives, and has talked about their
deaths in a cold and calculating man
ner.
"When he viewed the bodies of his
parents, brother and sister he remained
unmoved, and to outward appearances
was not a bit more affected than if
they had been total strangers to him.
He has conducted himself in a non
chalant manner since the night of the
terrible tragedy, and his lack of feeling
has turned from him many who would
have gone to his assistance under other
- circumstances.
The murdered persons were all highly
respected by their friends and neigh- :
bors, and when the funeral services j
were held in the little undertaking par- j
lors this afternoon these friends gath- j
ered around the flower-covered biers |
and gave way to their grief in heartfelt
tears.
reigned in the great chamber. His
answers, while made in a low voice,
were clear and distinct. He sat for
the most part of the time with his
face averted from his questioners.
Toward the end of the ordeal he be
gan to look cross and peevish and his [
answers were more or less snappish, j
COOLLY DISCUSSES MURDERS, j
i Weber was dressed in black from
j head to foot, even to a high black stock
about his neck. His hair was dishev
eled and hung down over his low fore
head. His eyes were bright and beady.
The peculiar sharpness of his features'
was accentuated as the inquest come to '
a close and the hard questioning of the
District Attorney began to tell on him. I
I He was composed to a marvelous de- j
, gree and discussed the death and mur
[ der of his family without the slightest
! show of feeling.

What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body in Healjh and
Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us our'
daily dose V)f sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood nurifler," tonic and cure-all,
and. mind you. this old-fashioned rem-
edy was not without merit.
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a single grain
is far more effective .than a tablespoon-
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years, research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur,
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
in drug stores under the name of
Stuarfs Calcium Wafers. They are
small chocolate coated pellets and con-
tain- the active medicinal principle of
sujphur in a highly concentrated, ef-
fective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health:
sulphur acts directly on the liver, and
excretory organs and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elimina-
tion of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this whsn
they dosed us with sulphur and molas-
ses every spring and fall, but the cru-
dity and impurity of ordinary flowers
of sulphur were often worse than the
disease, and cannot compare with the
modern concentrated preparations of
sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers Is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure con-
stipation and purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi-
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilklns while experiment-
Ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was. su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from consti-
pation or malaria, I have been ' sur-
prised at the results obtained" from
Stuarfs Calcium "Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re-
peatedly seen them dry up and disap-
pear In four or five days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuarfs Calcium Wafers Is a proprie-
tary article, and sold by druggists, and
for that reason tabooed by many physi-
cians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, . liver and
kidney troubles and especially, in : all
forms of skin disease as this remedy."
At any rate people ifho are tired of
pills, cathartics : and so-called blood
"purifiers." will find in Stuarfs Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, more palat-
able and effective preparation. <

Miles Across the Atlantic
Wizard of Electric Waves
Will Have Everything
Beady for Public Service
Before Christmas.
(Special to The Call)
N'EW YORK. Nov. 5. â SIgnor Marconi,
the wireless telegraph wizard, sailed for
home to-day on the Campania efter a
visit to this country of two months. He
expects to come back in December. -. .. j
He came here to install new high-
power apparatus at Glace Bay, Cape Bre-
ton, and is convinced that soon he will
be able to begin the regular trans-Atlan-
tic commercial service of the company.
He has been working for this a long
time. He said:
"I am now returning to England to !
make changes in the Poldhu (Cornwall) \
station corresponding to those at Cape
Breton. In December I hope to be able
to demonstrate that 3500 miles is no bar
to commercial transmission.
"It was necessary to have more power,
end I have new appliances a more
perfect radiation for the electric waves."
The above telegram announcing this
most important e\ - ent in the history of
the world appeared in the newspapers
last week. It is a peculiarity of Signor
Marcor.i that he does things first and
talks about them afterward. He has ful-
filled every premise he has ever made.
Ocean daily newspapers are now pub-
lished successfully. From the time the
big Jiners leave their dock until they
reach the other side the passengers find
the news of the world in a condensed
form beside their napkins when they go
down to breakfast each morning. How
email tho Atlantic must seem, how small
the world, to those who are kept in touch
with the shores. If the "sunken wire."
as Wblttter called the cable, excited the
wonder and admiration of our predeces-
sors, how much more magical is the wire-
less telegraph, which turns the whole at-
mosphere into a machine with which to
communicate with those thousands of
miles away. Of all inventions ever made,
wireless telegraphy is unquestionably
the most wonderful and is called upon to
rer.dtr the greatest service to mankind.
But few. even among the best posted,
have Â«rven a faint idea of what already
has been accomplished. The Marconi
system of wireless telegraphy is now
used EVERY DAY all over the world. It
has already been the means of saving
hundreds of lives and millions of dollars
of valuable property. , j
The Marconi system has numerous sta-
tions in operation in the United States.
Alaska, Canada. .England. Germany,
Italy. Belgium, Holland. France.
Spain, India, Japan. China, Rus-
eia, Chile, Africa. South Amer-
ica. Congo and a great many other
j>laces. The Marconi system is used
every day on ail the steamers of the
American line, the Allen line, the French
line, the Belgian line, the Atlantic
Transport line, the Beaver line, the Cun-
ard line, the Red Star line, the Ham- i
burg-American line, the Holland-Ameri- ]
can line, the Italian line ar.d many others. '
It has been officially adopted and sub-:
f idized with hundreds of thousands of i
dollars, and is prominently in use on alii
the principal men-of-war, of the leading I
tovtrrsments of the world. By the Mar- !
<xÂ»ni system wireless telegrams are |
flashed through the air to and from !
rteamfrs thousand* of miles away. In- I
credible as this may seem, nevertheless i
it is a FACT. ' j
We arc living in a remarkably progres-
sive age. Any one who has been to the !
World s Fair in St. Louis has seen with
Ida own eyes and doubts no longer the
wonderful and practical electrical inven-
tions which are to-<Jay replacing the
6low-goir.g methods of yesterday. Pro-
fessor Goldsborough. chief of the depart-
ment of electricity at the World's Fair,
in his report on the latest invention
stated that wireless telegraphy is the
most interesting if not the most impor-
tant invention of the decade, apd is to-
day thoroughly and successfully estab-
lished commercially. He said:
**It is used far more than people real-
ize in communications between stations
ca lar.<1 and upon sea."
Electrical inventions offer the greatest
opportunities of our age to those who
have th" foresight and the courage to
invest their savings in these latest time,
mony and labor saving inventions.
I^arÂ»re fortunes have been made by those
who invested in Edison Electric Light
and in Bell Telephone. The shares of
the Edison company increased from $100
to $4000 in one year. The profits of an
original investment of $100 in Bell Tele-
phone are to-day more than $200,000.
Marconi securities, taken NOW, Â«ffer as
great r.n opportunity.
The onsi of installation, ofÂ» mainten-
ance and of operation of the Marconi
pj-stem is so small compared with that
of the cable and wire systems that it can
afford to transmit messages for LESS
THAN HALF the price of the old sys-
tems. Therefore it stands to reason that
the public always gives the preference to
th* 1 cheaper rate.
Marconi securities have increased 100
per cent during the past twelve months.
a greater increase in value than any
other security in the same time.
The sale of Marconi securities has
b*t-n *'> successful that within a VERY
short time the stock will be all sold out.
The Marconi company is earning monkey
r-vÂ«>ry day. Its "sh5p-and-shore" business
will 'soon amount to -several hundred
thousand dollars a year. Its trans-At-
lantic stations alon*> will earn enough to
pay ANNl'AL DIVIDENDS of at least
ISO PER CENT.
As a consequence of the increased as-
*ets and revenues resulting from the re-
c^nt opening of several new and impor-
tant stations the price of Marconi certifi-
catrs will be further advanced any day
from IS to $7 WITHOUT FURTHER
WARNING.
Marconi has just announced to the
world that the new trans-Atlantic sta-
tion will be tr.rov/n open to the public
for commercial business on January 1.
Immediately following this most impor-
tant ever.t there is no doubt that Jlar-
cor.i securities will be worth from TWO
to THREE TIMES cr more the present
price, in view of the above facts you
should lose r.n time in securing all you
can afford to take.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 12.-rNow that
it is all over, the Government may be
expected to turn with more or less com
plaisance to the' consideration of a long
series of matters of wide general Inter
est that have been held somewhat in
abeyance.
Secretary Taf t will begin the resump
tionâI was golng.to say of the ordinary
course of thingsâ with his Journey to
Panama looking to the settlement of
the difficulty between that' state and
the canal strip. But the dispatching of
a member of the Cabinet to e foreign
country on a mission is altogether out
of the ordinary. However, it seems to
be I a popular move, so considered at
home as well as in Panama. That
; Judge: Taft will accompilsh the im
portant purpose of the journey no
doubt is felt.
Followirig him goes the Congressional
committee to survey the whole field of
the canal that they may learn at first
hand the legislative needs of that big
Job. The committee will eall from New
York about the 14th inst. on the trans
port Sumner, now being fitted out for
the purpose. Save for this Government
aid the members will ( pay their indi
vidual expenses. They will study the
conditions on , the- isthmus and will be
instructed in the problems of the great
undertaking, so that they may meet its
demands for the years of legislation
that are ahead with cjear, understand
ing. The present system of government
in the canal zone will be a subject to
study on the ground. If found atjfaujt
the committee will be able to suggest a
remedy. **
Shall- there be an extra session of
Congress to revise the tariff was a
query raised during the progress of the
campaign. The question is now to be
answeredâ probably in -the negative.
Extra session or not, there is the ques
tionâ¢ of. reciprocity with Canadaâ and
whal Is the answer? .
The -new Chinese exclusion treatyâ
how is it to be framed so as to meet all
demands as to granting wider privl r
leges to merchants and travelers and
yet preserving the same close rules as
against the admission of the objection
able class required particularly by the
Pacific Coast. That is to be determined
this winter. \
The -report on. the beef trust remains
to be acted upon. What may be done
with it is an interesting speculation.
Then there is Judge Days' report on
corruption among offlcialp in Alaskaâ
always a fruitful theme. What will it
disclose? â¢ ,
Will Mr. Wynne remain as Postmaster
General? If so, what is to be the v dispo
sition of Mr..Cortelyou? Jf not, what
is to be done with Mr. Wynne?. After
having been Postmaster - General his
former 'Job' is properly closed;, to htm.
There has been a good Â». deal of pub
lished speculation on these pointsâ^they
are now to be settled. Â¦
With all his tremendous energy the
The State Department will also,
among other things, havÂ«' to determine
as to what action shall. be taken re
garding the confiscation of the asphalt
property of American citizens by Presi
dent Castro in Venezuela; as to wheth
er to interfere in behalf of peace be
tween Haytl and Santo Domingo, West
India's warring, republics; . the Congo
Free State question, etc. .
Pictures df President Roosevelt befero
and after election are strikingly alike.
He is always highly Interested in some
thing. A week ago it was the election,
of course, though he by no means lost
interest in other things during the
warm .campaign. To-day he turns with
an enthusiasm no whit less in the work
that has piled up before the adminis
tration. - ' "Â¦
The President is 46 years of age. He
carries no sign of a gray hair and is so
full of ginger that a- fencing master re
cently said of him that he would fall
to become ah 'expert with the foils only
because he was so fond of making a
"rough house." As exercise he prefers
lively sports, and is given much, to ten
nis and fencing, but these have the
fault of being too tame for him.' though
he performs at either as hard as the
rules allow.
The routine of his life has not been
disturbed by the stress of the campaign
nor by the. results of the election. He
rises regularly at 7:30 o'clock and sits
down to a hearty breakfast an hour
later. Promptly at 9:15 he crosses at a
brisk walk from the White House to his
office, which is a plain little brick
building In the White House grounds
just west of the resideincej-a building
which Is called the "mystery," becaiisq
it is said, that no man'. can tell how
the. large sum ol money, that it cost
couid be put into the little thing. But
that has nothing to do with this story.
By 10 o'clock the President has had his
Interview with Secretary Loeb, dis
posed of his mail and dispatches and is
ready to receive visitors. Except on
Cabinet days these follow one another
in quick succession, each being heard
fully, however, until. 1:15. Then the
door IS clbscd to remain and the Presi
dent comes under the hands of his bar
ber there in his office.
luncheon is served at the "White
House at-a o'clock. Here there are in
variably several guests. ,A fter luncheon
the President usually spends a half
hour with his family on the south por
tico of the residence In summer, or goes
to his library to read unless something
of special importance calls him back
to his office. ' At 4:80 he turns to the
tennis court or goes for a ride or other
exercise. Dinner, iÂ» served at 7:30, ana*
here also there. Is usually, a guest.
The* President Is a great reader, |3Â«
vqurs books and newspapers and en-
Joys the cartoons â some of them â in
which he is pictured. His interest in
warships and in "naval architecture
amounts almost to a fad. He can dis
cuss this- subject even to minute de
tan's with the exparts. t

Blow Up Z Stroiis: Box â¢ AVith Â¦ Dynamite

TEHAMA, Nov. 12.â Burglars effected
an entrance to the general merchandise
store of D." Small & Son last night by
forcing . one of -the side doors. They
then proceeded. to dig a' hole In the front
wall of the brick vault contained there
in. The wall Is more than two feet in
thickness, but by using bars and dyna
mite they succeeded in cutting a large
hole around the hinges supporting the
iron doors.- which permitted of the doors
being forced open. Upon gaining an en
trance'to the vault they proceeded to
wreck a large safe. . The door of this
was blown open, evidently by dynamite.
Several coin sacks, containing $1500, are
missing from the safe, together with a
quantity of Jewelry.
The fondness of the little brown
men for American srlrls and the" fond-'
ness of a certain class of girls in; St.
Louis for their company have pror
duced morejthan one .unseemly; row,
on the fair crounds and in the city.

by San Franciscans and which seems
like a slice cut out of San Francisco's
Chinatown, so numerous are . the Du
pont and Clay street faces within its
lnclosure. It is alleged. that there is
a scheme on foot to turn loose in this
country the drove -of Celestials
brought direct from China under bond
for the concession. The several wily
Mongolians from San Francisco 'who
are connected with the 1 concession are
alleged to be connected with the plot.
The Government is keeping a close
Â¦vratch on the imported heathens and
it looks as if most of them would be
returned to China. An effort will un
doubtedly be made to- work the sub
stitution game In this case.
A coincidence in connection .with
this trouble is the fact that. James
It. Dunn, formerly Chinese Inspector,
in San Francisco, but who was.trans
fcrred to the Immigration Bureau In
St. Louis, is the Government official
in charge of the Chinese in the Pike
village. He Is expected to see that
none remain illegally in , this, coun-
It was alleged, that the guarded
Chinese had armed themselves heavi
ly and were preparing to make a dash
for liberty and . scatter themselves
throughout Missouri .until after, .; the
fair was a thing of the past- and; the
Government had relinquished its vigi
lance. A search' by United States
marshals did not reveal any arsenal. ,
The ranks of the Filipinos at the
World's Fair are beginning, to be
thinned out. . Manyrof the scouts and
other natives have returned to the
islands by way of San "Francisco and
those remaining are. not favorably im
pressed with the chill of the nights.

There are several varieties of trou-
The first county to have its exhibit
ready at the fair was San Joaquin, and
its commissioner, Colvin B. Brown, has
Ijten the first to depart for home. He is
now spending a few days in New Mex
ico, and will resume his labors for the
Stockton Chamber of Commerce about
the first of next month. Brown was ten
dered a banquet by his fellow exhibit
or? in the California section on the eve
of his departure. There were about for
iy people "at the banquet and several
speeches wtre made, the speakers re
ferring with pride to the work that had
been done and the good accomplished
for the State.
The affair was made the occasion for
the presentation to Commissioner
Frank Wiggins of a gold watch chain
by the county representatives. Brown,
as president of their organization, mak
ing the presentation speech.
Henry Ellis, who has been Commis
sioner Brown's assistant here and who
is known as one of the cleverest among
the California promoters, will have
charge of the San Joaquin exhibit dur
ing the rest of the fair and will attend
to repacking it and sending it home.
The repacking of exhibits cannot
be beeun under the rules of the ex
position until after the last, day of
the fair. It will take about two weeks
to repack the larger California dis
plays. This work is not so hard for
skilled hands, as everything- not used
up here eroes back into its old place
in the cases, which are kept In stor
age at the fair at the rate of 5 cents
per cubic foot, which Includes haul
ing to and from the freight cars.
There will not be much of this haul
ing to be done for the county exhibits,
as a double railroad track runs right
through the center of the Palace of
Agriculture ?.nd the freight trains can
he run into it.
The State Commission, with Its
more unwieldy exhibits on hand, -will
have a harder task packing, but ex
perienced men will tear things to
pieces and eet them on cans rapidly.
All the exhibitors hope to get home
before Christmas, but some will hard
ly reach California before the first of
the year.

having the circus come, to town, but it

th!p lesson has not been lost on the
world. "There must be money out there

Since the election the title of travel
rrom the coast has dwindled to small
proportions, and the yellow and the
blue badger, representing California
and her metropolis,' are not seen with
the frequency that they were. At the
California building 22,003 State badges
have been given away, and 2500 San
Krancisco badges have been passed out
at that city's building. Its register
shows that about 4500 San Franciscans
visited the fair. Mathematicians can
figure out from these statistics of at
tendance how much money the State
at California expended on the fair aside
from the quarter of a million spent in
exhibiting, including that contributed
by the counties. The only question that
tends to niakf- the estimate vague is
how much each of these visitors spent
here. Placing the average at $100, the

Walton Receives a Heavy Sentence
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 12. â Charles
W. Walton, the street car robber, con
victed of highway robbery and as

STOCKTON, Nov. 12. â Insanity. Is
the defense in the case of Howard
Bucklanfl, the 15-year-old boy who
shot and killed his father last Sep
tember some hourajafter deceased had
quarreled with and choked the boy's
mother. Much evidence was adduced
showing that the boy's love for his
mother was a passion and that he was
erratic and weak-minded. The case
continues to attract great attention
here and the courtroom is crowded
dally with spectators.
Evidence Is Introduced by the Defense
to Prove That Younc Prisoner
Is Weak-Mimled. SsS
INSANITY THE DEFENSE
OF BOY WHO SHOT FATHER
"The. outburst of animation and buoy
ancy which followed the election was
generally' anticipated, and, as in all
such events, extensive measures had
been taken in the stock market to reap
an advantage from the results The con
sequence was that enormous specula
tive holdings of stocks were thrown
upon the market to realize profits, and
the market afterward developed gome
hesitancy and uncertainty. The reac
tionary effect upon prices proved slight,
and the demonstration of the great ab
sorptive power of the market had the
effect of confirming speculative confi
dence. On the halt on Monday the deal
ings fell to the lowest total since the
present awakening of speculation devel
oped early in" October, but on Wednes
day the transactions recorded rose to
an aggregate of 2,351.000 shares. This
is the largest totalfor any day's busi
ness since May 9, 1901.
NEW- YORK, Nov. 12.â With no
change in the hopeful and cheerful
tenor of the news and with no abate
ment of the general confidence in gen
eral conditions, the desire to realize
profits so far overbore the eagerness to
secure new ownership in stocks as to
cause a decidedly irregular tone In to
day's stock. market. The price changes
compared with last night offered a very
mixed result at the end of the trading.
The dealings were very large and the
demand showed great variety. Transac
tions were well distributed and deal
ings were not greatly congested in a
few stocks:- The fayorlte speculative
stocks, which, usually lead the whole
market in point of activity, suffered
most from realizing and generally lost
ground during the day.
Conspicuous gains were made by th*
less 1 prominent railroad stocks- and by
many industrials and specialties which
are rarely heard of in the market. Such
g"alng were striking, extending to many
points in some cases, but their effort 1 is
never as reassuring to the general spec
ulative sentiment as the uplifting de
mand for standard stocks. Tne Wabash
and Illinois Central and Southern Pa
cific were the most effective sustaining
forces in the day's market, and United
States Steel preferred showed revived
strength in the late market when the
general tendency was downward.
The bank statement showed a larger
decline in cash than was expected, but
its effect on the surplus was modified
by the considerable loan contraction of
$14,789,600. The loan contraction is sup
posed to be due to the fact that several
of the large trust companies have been
active lenders of funds during the
week, thus relieving. demands upon the
banks. ' The liquidations 6t loans, from
the profit-taking in the stock market
is believed to have been more than off
set by the new "demand for speculative
purposes. Sterling exchange was strong
again to-day, and the likelihood of fur
ther gold exports to Paris during next
week is increased. Total sales, $7,295,000.

Jacob Bryan, who for, fourteen years was postmaster at Colma, knÂ«w that I felt badly
and he bimwlf bavins been - so successfully treated at the Electro-Chemlc Institute, 119
Grant ave., San Francisco, advised, me to try the .Electro-Chemlc treatment, as the med-
ical treatments which I had used were not reaching my trouble. So. on Mr.. Bryan's
recommendation I visited the Electro-Chemic Institute for examination and consultation.
which was free. I was so pleaded with the examination and advice given me that I did not
hesitate- to place thr treatment of my case' tn tha care of the Electro-Chemlc specialists
at once. I am glaJ : to say that ray Improvement was Immediate, and in about five wealcs
I was thoroughly currd at a small expense.' My trouble ' was bad circulation and con-
geitlon of Important: 'organs. â¢ My stomach, liver, . bowels and kidneys were

dlrzy spells, .eo severe at. times, that I could hardly keep from falllnr. and In fact,- at one
time I -iiil fall down and: was unconscious for some little time. My wife was Buffering
irreatly with rheumatism and congested liver. ThÂ« pain below the liver was so sever*
that we feared appendicitis/ My wife had good medical attention, but her trouble con-
tinued to grow worfe la spite of all we could "do. As I was letting along so nicely I
Insisted upon, my wife taking the Electro-Chemlo course and we are both delighted to
say that within two week V time she was thoroughly cured.- all pain about the appendix

years, seems to bq ' thoroughly cured in Just two weeks' treatment by Electro-Chemistry.
This seimj so wonderful to me that I am more than delighted to make this public ac-

WHAT THE MINISTER SAYS
13 3Iost Convincing.
"I thought I would write you what
Pyramid Pile Cure has done for me. I
had a moat aggravated case of bleed-
ing piles; indeed I dreaded when I had
to go to stool. One 50-cent box cured
me. I feel like a new man. I have
recommended It to others as being the
most wonderful remedy known. It i3
Indeed a great blessing to suffering
humanity. Tou are at liberty to use
this for all it is worth, and I hope it
may do good." Rev. W. E. Carr, 355
North Holbrook street, Danville, Va.
Clergymen (like all professional men
who lead sedentary lives) are espe-
cially addicted to piles. In various
forms, and are continually on the look-
out for a remedy which will give re-
lief, with little* or-no idea of obtaining
a cure.
Recognising this fact. Rev. Mr. Carr
consents to the use of his name in or-
der that other sufferers may know
there is a cure called Pyramid Pile
Cure, which is sold by druggists every-
where for the. low price of 50 cents
a package, and which will bring about
for every one afflicted with piles the
same beneficial results as in his own
case. Be careful to accept no substi-
tutes and remember that there is no
remedy "Just as good."
A little book describing the causes
and cure of piles is published by Pyra-
mid Drug Company, Marshall, Mich-
end will be sent free for the asking.
All sufferers are advised to write for
it, as it contains valuable information
on the subject of plies. "

.ST. LOUIS, Nov. 12.â After passing
through the deadly battles of the
great South African conflict, John
Backhouse, a British veteran of the
Boer war, . who on August 2 wedded
Miss Catherine Papsch of California,
was shot and killed at the World's
Fair- by Ernest Chriss, formerly a
member of one of the "Boer armies
during the Boer war and now a Jef
ferson Guard. i
Backhouse was In the employ of the
Boer War section. The | shooting af
fray occurred in the arena of the con
cession immediately - after the per
formance. Chriss says that .while he
wa$ standing: at the main gate of the
show, it was reported . to him .that a
fight was in progress inside.
S He walked into the arena and found
George Standevan and Daniel Devillers
engaged in . a flstlc conflict. Upon the
appearance of the Jefferson Guard the
flght ended. Chriss says â¢Â¦ Backhouse
seized him with the announced deter
mination of taking his ! revolver from
him. The guard immediately drew the
weapon and shot his assailant through
the groin.
â A, general encounter, between Boers
and Britons ensued. M*/iy blows ;were
struck, and revolvers wre drawn, but
no more shots were -.fired. Officials! of
the â¢ concession' arrived upon 'the i scene
after the fatal shot had been fired and
succeeded in parting -the combatants.
Before this had been done Chriss had
been badly beaten about the face and
shoulders. . -
:; A*, few. .minutes after' the ' shootlnsr
Backhouse was. -removed , to the
World's/Fair Emergency Hospital,
where he died four hours later. Chriss
was arrested. . The body of Backhouse
was sent to the St. Louis Morgue.
John , Backhouse was 33 years old
and , his home was in I Leeds.' England.
Ernest Chriss' is .24' years, old : and a
member: of Company. A of the Jeffer
son'Guards. He served under General
F.. A. Funston in the Philippines;dur
ing .the Spanish-American .war,) and
later went to, South Africa and fought

Starts Inquiry-
The instigator and backer of this
movement is bt st known to Americans
as Tennessee Claflin, who ran against
"Sunset" Cox for Congress, and. with
her older sister, Victoria . Woodhull
Martin, attracted attention in Wall
street and in financial circles during
the enrly seventies.
"I am back in America to start a
great %vcrk â a work which, as a little
girl, I prayed for. and later on labored
for." said she to-day. "I have not lost
eight of It; and now that I have health
and wealth to do this thing it's going
to be done. I mean the placing of
women in their right position in the
state â not in words, but in reality.
"Women will have the ballot within
four years. There will be a new po
litical party with a great national is
sue in the field before another Presi
dent is elected. I am here to help form
that party.
â¢I shall start political clubs in every
large city, town and hamlet of this
broad country. Halls will be rented
and rooms ivill be equipped with all
the requisites for campaign headquar
ters. I have already selected good
speakers and practical workers for ev
ery State in the Union.
"This If not a woman's campaign
alone. We want all strong, able, clear
headed men who are willing to help,
and we want, in our turn, to help elect
those men. A strong Presidential
ticket, combining the names of men
and women both, will be decided upon
as soon as possible, and these names
Â¦will float on great streamers outside all
headquarters of the clubs." 'â¢ i
NEW YORK. Nov. 12. â Women who
would vote are to come Into their own
at last if the campaign mapped out by
Lady Frances Cooke, who formerly was
Termie Clafln, is half as successful
a_s the expects it to be. A movement
extending from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific and from Canada to the gulf is
now being organized. President Roose
velt is to be asked to emancipate wo
man as President Lincoln emancipated
the negro. Millions are to be spent
In educating and enlightening the
members of both sexes, and Lady
Frances predicts that in 1698 a mixed
Presidential ticket will sweep the
country.
Special DUswteh to Tb* Call.
It is also the opinion of politicians
that Philip M. Walsh of Alameda is
developing the most strength in the
race for the Speakership of the Assem
bly. T. E. Atkinson of this city, it is
said, will not be able to get the support
of more than nine of the San Francisco
delegation. This will take him into the
House with tpo small a unit of strength
to enable him to make a formidable bid
for the chair. He may have enough
votes to capture the chairmanship of
the San Francisco delegation, but it is
pointed out that if those not directly af
filiated with his end of the party here
choose to stand together against him
they can force a compromise even in
this question.
The Legislature, however, Is yet some
time away and the amendment to the
constitution lengthening the sessions is
still in doubt. If this is passed It will
extend the period for manipulation, and
many political surprises have been born
in much less than the weeks that re
main before the solons gather at Sac
ramento.
Among the latest to be mentioned as
timber lor the bench are Judge E. C.
Hart of Sacramento,' Judge Carroll
Cook of this city; former Judge John F.
Davis of Amador, now Code Commis
sioner; Judge John F. Ellison of Te
hama, Judge A. J. Buckles of Solano,
Judge Henry A. Melvin of Alameda
County, General N. P. Chipman, Dis
trict Attorney Arthur M. Seymour and
Judge Peter J. Shields of Sacramento,
Judge Trask of Los Angeles and Judge
Oster of San Bernardino. Many others
are in the flght for the offices whose
names have not yet been given out.
The opinion prevails among the poli
ticians that George H. Pippy will be
finally agreed, upon by the Republican
Electors of this State to carry the vote
of California to Washington. They
point out that as president of the
Union League Club, which has grown
greatly during his incumbency, Mr.
Pippy has done much to further the in,
terests of the Republican party in the
State and that up to date he has asked
nothing of the party in reurn. It is
said that U. S. Grant of San Diego,
who has been mentioned as anxious to
carry the ballot to the national Capi
tol, is not so desirous of the honor as
to oppose any associate on the electoral
ticket. Mr. Pippy wants to take the
ballot East and the sentiment seems
now to be in his favor.
Advices from Sacramento indicate
that Governor Pardee holds not less
than one hundred applications from
lawyers and jurists of more or less dis
tinction, who want to be appointed to
the bench of the District Courts of Ap
peal. It is settled that the constitu
tional amendement establishing the
courts was ratified by the people at
Tuesday's election by a large majority.
This fact has led many aspirants for
the position to come out into the open
and announce their desire for appoint
ment at the hands of the Governor.

"If the Monroe doctrine is not to be
consigned to the political waste paper
basket If must rest in the last re
source upon naval and military power,
and If America has not a fleet strong
erough to say 'Thus far and on far
ther,' to those who challenge the doc
trine, that doctrine in the future will
not prove worth the paper on which
the Presidential message of 1823 was
written. Â¦
After predicting that the Panama
canal will be completed by President
it says the result of the election is .a
"subject for congratulation through
out the English-speaking world." ..
The Spectator then asks: ;.* vv hat
will he do with it?" and proceeds to
Credit Mr. Roosevelt with an" ideal
programme for the next four years,
the standard of which wiH.be,"Rea
son, justice, moderation and common
sense." *
Discussing the prospective policy of
the American Government in relation
to foreign affairs, the Spectator says
Fresident Roosevelt will not be afraid
to insist that the United States shall
hold her own among the great powers
of the world, but he will not seek for
eign entanglements. The paper con
tinues: :'."-" r *
"We believe his administration will
leave indelible traces upon the larger
part of the English-speaking race and
that for the whole of that race It will
be a lesson in and a sound example of
scund, sane Government."
The Speaker and the Saturday Re
view take a less enthusiastic view of
President Roosevelt's foreign policy.
The Speaker says it Is represented by
a determination to "get there Just the
same, which, involving as It does a
d?sregard of treaties and the employ
ment of armed force upon the slightest
provocation or pretext, represents a
grave danger."
The Saturday Review says: .
"We have often expressed the con
viction that this country has little to
gain In the end from a translation into
action of President Roosevelt's views
of foreign affairs."
Roosevelt, the Spectator says:
"In the Far East and in all that con
cerns the future of China we may ex
pt-ct the President, acting under the
advice of Secretary Hay, who is now
unquestionably one of the ablest if
not the ablest of living diplomatists,
to maintain the attitude already
adopted."
Concluding, the Spectator says:

' After several months' negotiations a Â¦
contract was signed yesterday between
the California Gas and Electric Cor
poration and the United Railroads,
wherein the former agrees to furnish
the street railway syndicate electric
"power to operate its system for a period
of twenty years. The contract goes
into effect on January 1, 1806. by which
time the power company will have es
tablished somewhere }n San Francisco
a' big plant through which electric cur
rent from Its big up-country generators
will be transmitted. to the various elec
tric car lines here. In discussing the
dear yesterday John Martin, .vice presi
dent of the electric , power company,
said:
"In order to take care of any possible
Interruption of service over our long
distance, transmission .line, which, by
the way, is now Jhe longest by nearly
100 miles of any in the world, our com
pany proposes >to install In this city a
complete gas" making plant, Including
every modern appliance. Thft gas we
maiiuf acture will be .used to operate
gas engines directly connected to elec
tric generators. The orders for these
engines have been placed already and
the first installation, will -be three en
gines and dynamos of 4000 kilo watt ca
pacity each, making, a total installation
of 16,000 horsepower at San Francslco. '"'
"The particular advantage of the use
of gag engines by the electric transmis
sion company is in the very low. cost of
producing, gas .by the crude oil water
System, the. patents for which we own.
It Is the Intention: of the company, to
enlarge Its, local Jgas plant' whenever
consumption demands." . .
Vice President Martin refused to state
just where -his company's local plant
will be established, giving as "a reason
that'^any" statement on the~ subject
might tend to -interfere with the com
pany'B purchase of property."
Â¦ 'The company is now furnishing pow
er ; fqr the/ electric street railways; in
Alanieda. , Marln, Nevada, 'Butte," Sor
lano,' San ; Joaquin, ; Sacramento- ; .and

EELLINGHAM. Wash., Nov. 12.â At
the receiver's sale thig morninp the
property of the Pacific-American Fish
eries Company, representing an original
Investment of at least 11,000,008, brought
5210.000. bid by W. A. Peters, an attor
ney of Seattle, for interests which he
refuses to disclose. It is commonly re
ported that he made the purchase for
New York creditors. Neither Peters nor
T. B. McGovern of New York, who ls
understood to stand close to the cred
itors, would discuss the subject.
The Pacific Packing and Navigation
Company, offered at the same time un
der decree of the Federal courts at
Washington and Alaska, had no bid
ders at the minimum price of $500,000.
.Accordingly the sale was postponed un
til December 10. at 10 a. m.. In this city.
Meanwhile the receivers will apply to
the courts for a modification of the or
der so that they may dispose of the
properties, including a large number of
Alaska, salmun canneries, one cannery,
ceven Bhirs and barks, thirty or forty
tugboats and several fish trap locations
on Puffet Sound and supplies inven
toried at J400.000, separately or in any
manner that will bring the best re
turns. The terms of the order prevent
ed acceptance of any bid unless the en
tire property would bring a total of
$500,000. Several men were ready to buy
Some portions of the, holdings, but not
all. The consequence was only one bid
of $1000 for a small Alaska cannery.
This could not be accepted. No diffi
culty is anticipated in disposing of the
ijoldingE at the next sale.
News has been brought to this city
that an effort Is being made to jump
.some of the best fishtrap locations in
Puget Sound, owned by .the Pacific-
American Fisheries Company. W. A.
Ptters. who bid in the concern at re
ceiver's sale this morning, has notified
Heeeiver Kerr that he will not accept
ihe property until the menace is re
moved. Mr. Kerr left thl* afternoon
for the fishing grounds to make lnveÂ»
tipatiun and declared that the al-
Icjred offenders will be taken before
Judg- Hanford of the Federal Cir
etrit Oourt on charge of contempt for
n'olfr5iÂ«ns property under the care of
the court.

AN* OBJECT LESSOX
In a Restaurant.
A physician puts the query: Have
you never noticed in any large restau-
rant at lunch or dinner time the large
number of h'earty, vigorous old men
at the tables; men whose ages run
from 60 to 80 years; many of them bald
and all perhaps gray, but none of them
feeble or eenile?
Perhaps the spectacle Is so common
as to have escaped vour observation
or comment, but nevertbelees it is an
object lesson which means something.
If vou TvjU notice what these hearty
old fellows are eating you will ob-
Berve that they are not munching bran
crackrrs nor gingerly picking their way
through a menu card of new fangled
health foods: oji the contrary, they
seem to prefer a Juicv roast of beef, a
properly turned loin of mutton and
even the deadly broiled lobster is hoi
altogether ignored.
The point uf all this is that a vig-
orous old cere depends upon good di-
gestion and plenty of wholesome food
and not upon dieting and an endeavor
to Jive upon bran crackers.
There is a certain class of food
crankp iyho cecm to believe that meat,
coffee ai.d many oihÂ«r good things are
rank jioisyr.e, but these . cadaveroufi.
BickJy looliins Individuals are a walk-
in? ccnCem-natioa of their own theo-
ries. ' \
Thc r.'.ottrr in a nutshell Is that if
the Etoir.ach secretes the natural dl-
pcttivp Jukor in pufllcient Quantity any

gested: If tl-e stomach does not do

Mrs. Loney brought over a favorite
horse on her recent return from the
United States, and she is now much
in evidence in her saddle along the
quiet country roads in the neighbor

the nearest town of any importance,
ehe invariably rides there and back
when she goes shopping. She has also
become an enthusiastic motorist and
thinks nothing of doing the journey to
London and back in a day.
Since the family returned from the

LONDON, Nov. 12.â A. D. Loney of
New York has now taken a long lease
of Willoughby Hall, formerly the resi
dence of Sir John Willoughby, a fine old
mansion, about seven miles from Rugby
In Warwickshire, and It is understood
that he intends to settle permanently
in England. For the last two years he
has bejen renting houses in different
parts of the country in the hope of
being able to find some place that
â¢would be congenial to his tastes and
habits. "When he went to Willoughby
about six months ago he entered into
an arrangement for only a year, but
the place has suited him so well that
he means to make it his permanent
homo In England.
Hitherto llr. and Mrs. Loney have
ehown no disposition to go much into
Bociety, preferring to lead a somewhat
retired and quiet country life, but since
their recent return from the United
States their ideas seem to have un
dergone a complete change. Their staff
of servants has been doubled, motors
and carriages have been added to the
number of vehicles already employed,
end pome spanking horses have been
introduced to the stables.

This negative Is developed like all
photographic negatives and is copied
on film, after which the two pictures
are laid one on the other, and thus a
negative Is obtained totally different
from the ordinary photographic nega
tivea. If the cage of prepared gelatin,
immersed in the special liquid, is ex
posed to the light under this negative
in five or six hours it will reproduce the
picture in relief with the utmost per
fection of detail.
â¢ Mr. Boese already has given practical
demonstrations before the Camera Club
and the Royal Institution of London
and the Urania Society in Berlin.
The difficulty in M. Boese's invention
was to procure a negative in which the
transparency would be proportioned to
the degree of relief which it was de
sired to obtain. In order to do this
the object to be photographed is placed
In a dark room In front of a specially
constructed camera and a special blue
light, filtered through a red prism, is
projected on it. Two poses are neces
sary, so that, having obtained the first
impression, the operator rapidly re
verses the negative and takes a second
picture on the same plate.
He explained the way he Is able to
produce in relief all sorts of pictures
by a very simple process. The funda
mental principle of the invention lies
in the discovery that gelatin, sensitized
with bichromate of ammonia loses
the property of absorbing liquids in
proportion to the length of time it has
been submitted to the action of light.
A cake of such gelatin immersed in a
special liquid under a photographic
negative will after a while show relief
and depressions, representing the image
on the negative.

At a recent meeting of the National
Genealogical Society, held in this city,
the constitution of the organization wan
amended so as to admit to membership
all persons Interested In the subject for
which the society was organized. The
society has been In existence about one
year, and has thus far, it is claimed,
been most successful. Its object has
been to collect and preserve genealogi
cal and historical data and to assist
its members in pursuing genealogical
investigation.
The local branch of the society has
more than fifty members and Is in good
working order. There are numerous
honorary members throughout the
world, all of whom are pledged to fur
ther the Interests of the society as
much as possible. Among the better
known of the honorary members out
side of the United States are the king
at-arms of England, Ulster and of
Scotland; A. M. Mclntosh, author, Scot
land; Captain Douglas Wlmberley of
Inverness, author; and a late captain
of the Seventy-ninth Cameron High
landers, who was at the siege of Luck
now with Colin Campbell; John Bul
loch, editor; J. M. Balloch, A. M., au
thor; Captain Alexander Balllle of the
ancient family of Bailie of Dochfour;
I. Dunain. Monsieur Meschinet de Kich
emonde of France.
The purpose of the society Is to labor
unceasingly in an effort to secure the
passage of an act of Congress whereby
the revolutionary. pension and land re
cords and all other valuable patriotic
and historic data shall be printed.
Meanwhile It will endeavor to print all
of such data which the society or Its
members may collect or to which ac
cess can be secured, provided the fin
ances of the organization permit. It is
also Intended to collect from its mem
bers and arrange in one Immense card
index all the Intermarriages of which
they secure information, or which they
may be able to furnish from manu
scripts and town records, and to pro
vide means whereby transcripts from
this index may be periodically sent to
members or searches therein can be
made, queries answered and reports
furnished to its members or to others
who may Inquire, this idea being
known as the clearing- house proposi
tion. It is further proposed to collect
and publish reliable data on the sub
ject of heraldry, and to provide a sys
tem by which coats-of-arms submitted
may be compared with the copies from
which they are made, and their accu
racy certified under the seal of the
society.
To unearth and expose the swindles
so frequently perpetrated upon unsus
pecting persons In this country, by
those who claim to have discovered
property, titles, etc., which are due by
right of Imaginary descent, is another
object of the society, and to assist the
members in their genealogical labors
along any practical lines which may be
suggested and approved. One of tho
objects of the organization Is to col
lect and publish in its official leaflets
historic, patriotic and genealogical In
formation and data which is not other
wise generally available, and to thus
make the leaflets valuable even to non
members and to accumulate for the
benefit of its local members, those who
may visit Washington, or others who
may inquire, a mass of Information by
way of printed and manuscript records
and data, as well as by the establish
ment and maintenance of a standard
catalogue index of those who au or
have been working on any genealogy
or who have information which would
be of assistance to others so engaged;
finally It Is desired to amplify the use
fulness along these lines Indicated, as
well as to enter other fields, where sug
gestion and consideration lead the-pro
per authorities to believe the scope of
the organization could be widened with
out additional expense to Its members,
but yet to their advantage. To these
ends, and especially as last outlined,
members are requested to furnish all
reasonable suggestions which would
redound to the credit of the society and
to accompany them with details as to
the manner In which their several prop
ositions should be carried out. From
time to time the decisions and rulings
of the various committees will be pub
lished in these leaflets, and marked
copies sent to correspondents should
be considered as respectful answers to
questions.

Ean Francisco, g^ive the following ver
eion of the affair:
OAKLAND. Nov. liâ Enraged be
cause his former wife, Laura Cutler
Campbell, whom he had driven by
cruelty to divorce him, refused to re
turn and live with him again, Lem
Campbell, a butcher, shot and seri
ously wounded her to-night at the
home of her father, 1362 Eleventh
street. In the confusion following the
shooting Campbell made his escape
and the police are looking for him.
Mrs. Campbell was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where she was at
tended by Drs. Stratton. Emerson and
Adams.
Mrs. Campbell is a petite blonde
and pretty with fluffy hair. She Is
only 22 years of age, but has been
married twice and twice divorced.
Her first husband was John Graham,
an engineer in the Fire Department.
She married him when she was but
17 years of age. Hardly a year had
passed before she was forced to get
a divorce on the ground of neglect.
Then she married Campbell, and his
Intemperance and cruelty forced her
to leave him. She was granted an
Interlocutory divorce from him nearly
a year ago and in a few days a final
decree can be entered.
While her wound is not necessarily
fatal it is of a serious character and
may lead to complications that may
cause her death. The bullet entered
the left side and lodged Just under
the skin at the back. It Is believed
to have entered the abdominal cav
ity and gone through the spleen.
Sunday, 1:30 a. m.â Campbell was
captured this morning by Policeman
Ahern after a desperate struggle, which
resulted in sending the prisoner first
to the Receiving Hospital and later
to jaii. . - ; :

finally he pulled a pistol out of his
pocket and flourished 1C Then I went
over to him and told him to leave the
place. He put the pistol Into his
pocket and went into the hall and al
most Immediately we heard two shots.
My wife was so badly frightened that
she pulled me out of the front door
and down the steps out into the street
and I don't know where Campbell
went to." '..-.-â¢.;

BUTTER-MAKERS GET RATES
FOR CONTENTION'. OF 1905
The police are searching for a man
who tried to pass a fictitious check
lest Thursday morning on Golder
Bros., grocers, 1416 Howard street.
The check was for $10 on the Wells-
Fargo Bank and purported to bear the
sJgmature of B. H. Simmons. It was
made payable to Mrs. A. Ottinger,
1301 Page street. The man sent two
small boys to the store with the check
and a note purporting to be written
by Mrs. Ottinger asking the grocers to
cash the check and she would call
later and settle with them. The boys
were to bring the money to the man.
The grocers became suspicious and
telephoned to Mrs. Ottinger, who said
she knew nothing about the check.

The effort of Miles T. Balrd and his
wife, Ruth Jackson Baird, to set aside
the ten years' trust created by him
with the Union Trust Company, where
by his forty valuable shares in the
Baird estate were effectually tied up,
is meeting with a determined opposi
tion from his mother, Veronica C.
Baird. In the suit to declare the trust
void, begun last December, Mrs. Baird
was named as one of the defendants
with the trust company.
Baird in his complaint said that the
agreement for the trust was made on
May 9, 1903, but on April 28 preceding he
had contracted to transfer twenty
shares to his wife. In November fol
lowing he boirowed $25,000 from his
mother with which to pay his debts,
and conveyed the stock to her as se r
curity. The agreement with his. wife
was for his payment to her of $200 a
month for family- support.
Yesterday Mrs. Balrd and the trust
company filed an answer and cross
complaint asking that it be decreed that
the trust is valid for its full term of ten
years: that the Union Trust Company
be entitled to the full possession ,of the
stock for that time, and that the divi
dends be applied to the payment of the
interest on and principal of the debt to
the mother.
The answer states that the defend
ants have' no knowledge of Baird's
agreement with his wife, and therefore
they deny that she is the owner of
twenty of the shares. The trust is des
ignated as a "spendthrift trust," and
the cross-complaint sets â¢ forth with
tome particularity as to why it was
created.. ;\

center. Chicago and Philadelphia are
turned down and San Francisco is pre
ferred. This city is one of the best bond
buyers in the United States. The $20,
000,000 of bonds of the United Railroads
were handled here, and of the total
$16,000,000 found San Francisco buyers.
The $6,000,000 of bonds of the San Joa
quin Valley Railroad and the large re
cent issue of bonds of the San Fran*
Cisco Gas and Electric Company were
sold at home. Many other large bond
issues have been taken up in San Fran
cisco, and the reputation of the city
has been fixed by such transactions.
I. "W. Hellman Jr. says that the impe
rial Japanese Government loan is in
two series. It will be due October 6.
1911. Abroad it will be in charge of the
Paris Bank, Limited^ the Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation and
the Yokohama Specie Bank. The rate
of interest will be 6 per cent sterling.
The loan will be placed at SS per cent of
the rar value, and the interest will be
paid semi-annually in gold in New
York and London. At the sale rate of
88 per cent of the par value the interest
will amount to 8 per cent per annum.
Back of the bonds, in addition to the
credit of Japan, will be a charge upon
the customs revenues. The subscrip
tion may remain open one week, but
may be closed at any time without no
tice.
The Japanese Government retains the
right to call in the loan at par after two
years on six months' notice. If the
Japanese Government should end the
war in two years and elect to stop pay
ing interest during the full term for
which the bonds may run the interest
rate, so Mr. Hellman figures out, will
amount to 12 per cent. The bonds are
in denominations of $500 and $1000.
The Japanese war loan of $60,000,000
will be offered to subscribers at 10
o'clock to-morrow in San Francisco,
New York and London. In this city the
securities will be offered through the
Nevada National Bank. Kuhn, Loeb &
Co., the National Gity Bank of New
York and the National Bank of Com
merce of New York will handle the loan
In the East. One-half of the loan .will
be in the United States and one-half in

quarters. Miss R.IC Guard, secretary

In speaking of the work of the com
ing convention, Mr. Mahon said that
the labor outlook was decidedly hopeful
and that this would be one of the busi
est sessions in the history of the feder
ation. Regarding the action of the ex
ecutive council in revoking the charter
of the Chicago Federation of Labor,
Mr. Mahon expressed himself as at a
loss to account for the committee's ac
tion. He added, however, that the
standing of Mr. Schardt, delegate from
the Chicago body, would not be in
doubt, but that the delegate would take
his place on the floor of the convention.
The questions of wage disputes and
trade jurisdictions, Mr. Mahon said,
were things that would eventually de
cide themselves, and that all that was
needed was a sensible consideration of
the facts.
Mr. Mahon spoke in very decided
terms against the introduction .bf poli
tics into the federation. He said that
the Socialist delegates to the conven
tion had tried at nearly every yearly,
meeting to have the federation commit
ted to socialism, and that they would
again bcturned down, as were the del
egates of other political parties that at
tempted the same object. The only
delegates to the convention, he added,
will be those from organizations affili
ated with the American Federation and
fraternal delegates from Great Britain
and Canada. Invitations have for many
years been sent also to the trade or
ganizations of France and Germany.
Regarding the forming of an interna
tional organization of labor unions, Mr.
Mahon said that the only steps in that
direction were taken by the longshore;
men of the international transporta
tion lines. He added that it was a
hard enough job to get the labor unions
of the United States into line.
L.ATER ARRIVALS. v V
The headquarters of the American
Federation of Labor at the Russ House
was the scene of great activity yester
day. Many delegates from the East
and Pacific Coast States arrived and
registered and the committee for the
entertainment and reception of the vis
itors met in the evening and adopted a
plan for the proper welcoming 'of the
Incoming delegates.
Among those who registered at head
quarters was W. D. Mahon of Detroit,
president of the Amalgamated Associa
tion of Street Railway Employes. Mr.
Mahon was accompanied by Rezin Orr,
treasurer of the same organization.
In the evening a mass meeting will
be held at the Alhambra Thea.ter un
der the auspices of the Carmen's and
Butchers' unions. The gathering will
be addressed by members of the ex
ecutive council and visiting delegates
to the federation. The Machinists'
Union also will give a jinks to visit
ing delegates at NatiVe Sons' Hall. *
To-morrow the convention opens at
9 a, m. at Lyric Hall. The officers of
the executive council will preside. The
preliminary business of the conven
tion will be the report of the commit
tee on credentials, following which
will come the appointment of com
mittees to arrange the order of busi
ness for the two weeks.
The committee on arrangements
met last night in parlor 3 of the Russ
House and completed the appoint
ment of committees to receive the del
egates. A special committee of three,
consisting of O. A. Tveltmoe, chair
man; J. Kean, secretary, and J. E.
McDougald, treasurer of the commit
tee of arrangements, will greet the
visitors at Port Costa. The remainder
of the committee, including P. H. Mc-
Carthy, E. L. Nolan and Al Smith,
will await the delegates' arrival on
this Bide.

THE VAIiTJE OF: CILVRCO AJj.
Few People Know How Useful It Is In
Preserving Health qnd Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal-: is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize Its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; It is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs . the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and Intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and lm-
f >roves the complexion, it whitens the
eeth and further acts as a natural and
safe cathartic. ;* Â»?'
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting
! lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The dally use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and- purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but on the contrary,
great benefit. -Â¦
A Buffalo physician. In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the com-
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
arid throat: I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the dally use of

GAMES WON AND LOST BY THE RIVAL UNIVERSITIES
rHIS year's game was the
finest exhibition of football
and one of the most spec
tacular I have ever seen on the
coast. My opinion Is that the
representatives of Stanford won
because the men were In supe
rior physical condition and
played together better than did
the representatives of Califor
nia. The blue and gold men
should feel proud of then* team,
for although losers they fought
every minute and did not
quit at any stage of the game.
I was delighted to see the
sportsmanlike attitude of both
the players and the rooters. It
Is no easy thing to stand hi your
own bleachers and cheer while
a victorious rival cavorts on
your field, yet California did
this. All honor to its adherents.

President Wheeler was on the firing

though It pained him to see his cour

an institution that put forth such men.
He was loud in his praises of the men
who played on both elevens. He ad
mired their Spartan spirit and the
clean, sportsmanlike way each side
played. What gladdened his heart was
the splendid spirit shown by the root
ing sections of both colleges. Never be

injured or applauded clever college
yells. This proved to President
Wheeler, as It did to every one who
was within the big lnclosure, that even

Although football is a rough game
and the padded athletes who sprang at

collegiate gridiron battle suffered in-
Jury, not a player lost his temper nor
committed a breach of the rules. It was
a clean-cut, gentlemanly game, par
ticipated In by men who represent the
highest types of the college athlete. It
was a pathetic sight to see brave ath
letes, withdrawn from the field be
cause of injury, weep on the side lines
because they were not permitted to
risk life and limb for their alma ma
ter. It was also heart-stirring to see
fair women cast flowers into the arena

CAPTURE RED BALLOONS
Shields was - not the equal of Heit
muller; on the cardinal's right tackle,
but with the able assistance of Roose
velt '. he helped : the backs make many
yards on his side of the line. Clark
quent and were" caused by overzealous
ness on the part of the line men to get
away with the ball. The weather was
a trifle sultry for such a strenuous
game. The field was in as good condi
tion as possible without turf. There
were but few Instances of fumbling,
and none of these proved expensive.
California was markedly superior in
punting. It is laigely due to "Heine"
Heitmuller that the cardinal did not
roll up a man' 3 size score. His kick
ing In the. first half evened up for
the line-bucking of the visitors. Cap
tain Stroud played a heroic game for
the blue and gold at center. Time
after time he broke through and
stopped plays, but support was lack
ing. His work aroused the admiration
of every spectator and when he waa
helped off the field in a crippled con
djtion the cardinal " rooters gave him
well deserved cheers. California has
ample reason to be proud of her foot
ball captain. Hyde played a fair game
at center for Stanford, but was no
match for his opponent.
CARDINAL GUARDS "ARE STRONG
-Roosevelt, at the visitors' right
guard, was too good for Gray and
Haffey, who went against him. He
had Â¦ a strenuous name to start with
and the strength, alertness and brain
to back it up. He brushed his oppo
nent out of the way and made a big
hole every time he received the proper
signal. , Thompson did wonders on the
other side of center with Stern and
Kerr.- He and Sprott appeared to be
making way for , a three-seated auto
mobile instead of for backs, who could
almost sift through a keyhole in their
f rerizy to advance the pigskin.
It is due more, to the linemen, who
made the holes, than to the backs, who
carried the ball, that Stanford secured
three touchdowns. I frequently saw
Weller, Chalmers and Dole get from
three to seven yards past the rushllne
before a California man could brush
at them with his finger tips. This fact
in no way detracts from the splendid
game played by the cardinal backs,
but without some, crackajack men In
the line they would never have been
so busy as they, were last night figur
ing up their respective gains.
Color everywhere, from the sprout
ing: green on the hiMs to the peacock
drippings of the grand stands. Two
blotches of solid dye flanked the field,
the one vivid with the cardinal of the
Stanford rooters, the other shrieking
with the blue and gold bonnets of
Berkeley's young men. Then In the
covered sections on each side of the
gridiron blossomed the gay dresses
and satin streamers of women. When
the masses of spectators rose to yell
the tints jumbled-and ran Into * riot-
A fierce measuring of strength for
thirty-five grilling minutes, a sudden
crumbling and then the heartbreak of a
team's wreckingâ that spells the story
of the fourteenth intercollegiate grid
iron battle, held yesterday on the new
field in Berkeley. Eighteen counts the
sum of Stanford's superior forces,
against which the straining energy of
Berkeley was as naught.
A grinding and a mauling, Bav,age,
incessant, was what beat down the
eleven defenders of the blue and gold
after their strength had snapped before
the game's early assaults. Upon the
BTllled field there was enacted a terri
ble demonstration of the law that the
fittest only survive. Around about the
lime-streaked soil jammed thousands
Bat tense and trembling while the ham
mer, hammer, hammer of brute force
â¢worked out the inexorable dictates of
that law. The weak fell battling and
the strong exulted in their might.
Truly, if football be really a game only.
It is deadly like the game of life itself.
For several thousands of students and
the tens of thousands of their friends
yesterday was the day of days. During
long weeks the picked athletes of two
great universities had been trained,
coached, drilled and dieted into -the
perfection of physical condition and the
acme of mental alertness. In these
twenty odd men, some In red and some
in blue Jerseys, that indefinable thing,
the honor of alma mater had been vest
ed. Upon the strength of a muscle, the'
quickness of an eye, hung the partisan
hopes of men and women, young and
old. the State over. Little wonder Is It,
then, that when the turning of the bal
ance was to be decided yesterday after
noon full sixteen thousand ribbon
decUed folk massed themselves tier on
tier about the California fields. The
rawest freshman from Mllpitas rubbed
shoulders with a bank president: a
minister of the Word clapped a Bteam
fltter on the shoulder and screeched as
one possessed of a devil.
ROOTERS SPRING SURPRISE.
With machine like regularity
A conference of officials, 'little Hop
per shaking hands with Coach Lana
gan. and then the men in canvas
aligning' themselves in the arena.' The
scream of the referees whistle, a
thump of the * yellow â¢ ball springing
high from Ssrott's foot and the 'game
is on. 3R39S
The men from Palo Alto turned the
Calif ornian's precious yell into a scof
fing and a hissing. "Skyrocket!"
Berkeley would reply with a rising in
flection signifying -Stanford's ambi
tions, but ending the shibboleth in a
groan of squelched hopes.
Then the teams came trotting on,
the blue and gold ' men first To his
feet leaped every spectator and- the
air waa torn with the Jangling of
yells. Out of the welter of noise
came the solemn organ notes of Stan
ford's hymn to . the Â¦ college. Men . and
girls sans: in sweet unison,' standing.'
FIERCE STRUGGLE BEGINS.
WEIRD YELLS SPLIT THE AIR.
The yells â but everybody. - knows
them by this time. The barking
"Rah-rah-rah, Stanford!"- and the
long-drawn cumulative Berkeley "Os
ki-wow-wow!"
There were some new ones, con
ceived out of the quick wits of Bulke
ley and Thorpe, the rival yell" leaders,
and these were bandied back and
forth through the braying mega
phones of the students.
"Lusty, blow, blow
Always crow, crow."
ous scheme almost paralyzing to the
eye.
Surprises were sprung everywhere.
Over where the Stanford claquers sat
in a so^Id rank of red there were a
few mysterious movements, and
prestol a great white "S" appeared
picked out against' the glaring back
ground. All this because some of thein
genious youths had arrayed themselves
in cooks' caps and nighties according
to the necessary alignment of their
university's initial letter. . Next from
Berkeley's rooters there suddenly shot
aloft a skyrocket trailing on its stick
shreds of the college colors. Then
from Stanford another Joke. Hoisted
upon an Improvised screen- there ap
peared the familiar legend* of a break
fast food with the motto that "Sunny
Jim (Weller) eats Force." Then it was
California's turn to throw* a- trick.
The trick was little 4-year-old Willie
Llndberg, who appeared .before, the*
rooters, garbed all in blue and gold,
to lead thenv in the yells with his baby
arms. Â¦". -",'\. ,
Men began to totter and stumble, in
the California lighting front. First,
Sperry had to be led sobbing from the
field. Next Mead went, then Gray.
Then Captain Stroud, dazed and blind
ed, was drawn to the side lines .by the
coaches. The blue and gold team, rud
derless and beaten to "a daze, fought
blindly against two more inevitable
touchdowns. Finally, as if by the
irony of -fate, the last whistle sound
ed with, the ball only, a few feet from
the coveted Stanford goal.
Then the Berkeley ranks had 'to sit
in . the gathering dusk and watch Â¦ the
serpentine dance of the cardinal : zig
zag California field in delirious vic
tory. And while they watched they
sang. . . â¢ .
A ball pushed over the last line, then
the splitting staccato yelp from the
cardinal. Again the hammering. "Wel
ler, Chalmers find Dole pushed through
the weakened defense relentlessly,
"Hold 'em, California!" wailed the
Berkeley cohorts. Five, ten yards at a
time crashed the bullet formation from
behind the Stanford rush line, rending,
smashing:. i Â¦
sounds the muffled Impact of mass
hittingr mass. A sprawling pile of
kicking bodies, the sudden shifting
into position, quarterback's nervous
bark, and then again that thudding
Jar. Neither side has.victorx. Down
the field the Stanford backs work the
pigskin by inches at a time, only to
lose to Berkeley and see their hard
gained yards of advantage swallowed
up by the soaring punts of Heitmuller.
The ball stays persistently in Cardinal
territory and the heart of thÂ«s Call
fornian rooter is clad within him.
- But then came that terrible second
half. The battering and the bruising
power of Jim Weller's head had worn
down the strength of the men oppos
ing. The Berkeley line wavered, then
held, then crumpled up. President
"Wheeler squatted down on the side
lines near Coach Hopper and spoke to
him, once, twice. Hopper, with his
bent knees trembling and his teeth
clenching a wicked black cigar, had his
eyes and his thoughts on that weak
ening line and did not hear.

They Fired on His Men.
An Englishwoman who is now trav
eling in this country was discussing
traits of Irish character with Lord
Kitchener on one occasion. The sol
dier told her that during the Boer
war an Irish colonel of much zeal and
still greater impetuosity had some of
his men out scouting. one night, when
they ran across another detachment
of soldiers, who took them' for Boers.
The newcomers fired on the colonel's
men, who promptly returned the vol
ley, but no harm resulted beyond the
killing of a mule. Kitchener sum
moned the colonel and asked: "Why
did you fire on that detachment?"
"Bad luck to them," was the explosive
reply, "and didn't' they fire on my
men, general?"â Chicago Chronicle.

Neither side tried tricks. Bansbach
made twenty-five yard* on a quarter
back run in the first half and was
downed so hard that he had to be put
out of the game for repairs. There
was practically no slugging.
Stanford loses seven of her best men
this year and Lanagan will have a
hard job ahead of him next season.
If Hopper or some one else with his
unusual ability handles California

The Quarterbacks on both eleven?
distinguished themselves. Little
Bcothe astonished himself and every
one else by his remarkable improve
ment over his tvork during practice
games. He ran in punts like a younrj
Hercules and handled his eleven
rapidly. Bansbach played hard, fast
and with that fierceness which is char
acteristic of him. When he was laid
out Stott seemed Just as strong as his
predecessor in the place. It was a
pleasure to every one who has watch
ed Stanfords' games to see little Stott
get the coveted football "S."
Chalmers played a spectacular game
Rt right half. Once in the last twenty
minutes of play he ran in a kick
eighty yards from the cardinal flve
yurd line. At any other time after
California hit the. incline he was good
for from five to fifteen yardi? Chal
mers covered more ground than his
running mates, but he had big
holes opened for him and things were
coming his way. Dole is always a
mere consiftent half and in uphill
Rimes has thoroughly demonstrated
.this fact. Weller made grains when he
fcund the barn doors open, but was
downed without gain when he struck
a folid place 1n the blue and gold line.

Dole forthwith kicked outside three
yards from center. The ball was
brought in and Sperry made four yards
on two bucks through Stanford's right
tackle. Heitmuller punted to the five
yard line, and Eansbach ran the ball
in ten yards. After a preliminary rush
Dole kicked to center and Clark got
the pigskin on a fumble.
Bansbach made between twenty and
twenty-five yards on a quarterback
run. He was downed so hard he had
to retire from the game. He had a
clear field with the exception of Boothe
and almost hurdled him. The ball was
fumbled in the mix-up, and a Califor

Heitmuller punted twenty yards past
center. Chalmers, Weller, Sprott and
Dole made ten yards, but Shield got
off side and Stanford was penalized.
Dole punted fifty yards and Boothe ran
the ball back without help for twenty
five yards. California lost five yards
for offside on a kick, but Heitmuller
booted the ball on the next play to tho

looked serious for the home team.
Sproit gained five yards. Chalmers
was downed for a small loss and Dole
also failed to connect. An attempt at
a field goal was blocked, and Snedlgar
carried the pigskin to within ten yards

them, and the' first named was then
ordered to punt. He sent the ball
thirty yards to Boothe, who was down

Heitmuller immediately punted
eighty-seven yards over Bansbach's
head. Dole punted back ten yards past

The theater was packed to the limit
of its capacity, and the noisemakers
had possession of the rear part of the
gallery. The football players arrived
late, entered when the gas was down,
and there was therefore no demonstra
tion over them. Finally the lights were
turned on, the heroe3 of the gridiron
were discovered and the gallery rang
with cheers for them.
A number of cuts had to be made in
the show because of the turn of for
tune, but these did not mar the play
noticeably. Not many pretensions were
made for it anyway, and a good
natured audience took things happily
as the amateurs made merry on the
stasre. ! . v;vv
The mon from Stonford was an Eng
lishman, who had many exciting ex
periences in trying to uncover a i>lot .of
Berkeley to play "a professional in its
football eleven. He went to Monterey,
thought he had found a clew and fol
lowed his suspect to Berkeley, where
he found there -was absolutely no
pround for the suspicion of trickery.
He was so utterly disgruntled that he
telegraphed to Stanford that he wpuld
never be back there and that he was
about to return to London. There were
many amusing situations, the actors In

BERKELEY MEN FORGET
DEFEAT AT PLAY.
Three times early In the opening
half were the representatives of old
Nassau penalized for off-side play and
once for holding â a distance of thirty
yards, a great advantage .for a fierce
line bucking aggregation like the Yale
eleven. In the same half Yale suf
fered oyly once for a penalty and at
the time the ball was so far in Prince
ton 1 " territory that the five yards
availed, practically nothing. The game
was absolutely devoid of spectacular
plays.
Each man on the Princeton eleven
endeavored to do his share, but
Princeton's gains and her defense
were due in a great measure to the in
dividual playing of three men- â Coon
ey, Foulk and Miller. The former
was used as a battering ram on the
Yale line and seldom failed to gain
his distance, and the two latter as the
second line of defense were brililant.
Hogan, Bloomer, Leavenworth and
Owsley were used to rip up Prince
ton's line and â¢were universally, suc
cessfully. Shevlin showed no signs of
fatigue. While Yale outplayed Prince
ton in the opening half the latter
clearly had their opponents on the de
fensive in the closing half. During
the last thirty-five minutes of play
the ball was almost continuously in
Yale's territory except when Hoyt
would kick. Yale's goal was never re
ally in danger.

a local or skin disease, but a disease of the blood caused by a sour, acid condition of that vital fluid. The kidneys
end bowels get weak, the liver torpid, and the poisonous accumulations that should pass off through the usual
channels of nature are absorbed by the blood and distributed into the muscles, joints and nerves through the circu-
lation, producing inflammation and swelling of these parts, excitement of the nerves and other painful and disa-
greeable symptoms of the disease. Rheumatism sufferers look with dread upon the winter season with its damp,
cold, changing weather, for the first slight exposure is liable to bring on an attack, and the sharp, cutting pains and
feverish, swollen joints and muscles make life miserable with almost unbearable torture. Local applications will
.jrf^flfet often give relief for a little while, but can do no permanerr good, because the
Â¦<y^^^|''->iÂ»iHffl|" fisBEaBl trouble is not within their reach; and even while the symptoms are being ra-

PARIS, Nov. 12.â A leading milliner

BROWNS PLAY PERFECT BALI/.
It was, the auctioneer told the crowd,
a unique chance for a bold speculator.
Many were the uses to which, he con
ceived, it properly might' be put. One
of th<? most natural was to extend the
canal to Southampton in one direction
and to the Thames in the other, a pro
ject which he admitted would require
Parliarm-ntary powers. Another and
mere daring suggestion was that the
canal should be drained and converted
into a great automobile highway forty
mJles long, on which you could go as
you please. This also would require
a short act of Parliament because the
purpose to which land may be put is
clearly defined by the statute.

After the game Lewis Bulkeley,
leader of the California "rooting sec
tion." gathered his shouters and led the
way to Harmon Gymnasium. From the
steps Bulkeley told a pathetic story of
the capture of many hundred cardinal
balloons. It appears the Stanford con
tingent had ordered $50 worth of bal
loons and intended turning them loose
at an auspicious moment in the game.
Bulkeley and two other wearers of the
blue and gold learned this, and, ap
pearing at the manufacturers', they
boldly announced they were Stanford
men, and, putting up the ' necessary
money, secured their booty ' and . on
reaching the open air turned the bal
loons loose. Bulkeley modestly gave
the credit to his two assistants, but the
"rooters" would not have it â¢ and
cheered their leader for his work.
The rooters then sang "Hail. Califor
nia," outside the windows of the gym
nasium t and also cheered the beaten
team: by their lusty cries.
The Stanford hosts departed after
filling the quiet town of Berkeley with
shouts of victory Â¦ and the sound of
blaring trumpets.
guilty of this infraction of the rules.
"It was a magnificent game of foot
ball," said Mr. Best enthusiastically.
"It was one of the most exciting games
I ever saw. Stanford maintained her
splendid defensive tactics throughout
the game, whereas California weaken
ed in the second half. Both elevens
came closer to the Eastern standard
than any of the teams in the North
west. The game was remarkably Â«lean.
and was therefore easy to handle."
The awaiting thousands were nearly
cheated out of the exciting contest.
The Stanford eleven and numerous
substitutes arrived at the West Berke
ley station at 1 o'clock and the red
stockinged aggregation piled into
awaiting 'buses. They were driven
through the grounds and the players
were cheered by their admirers. Every
thing went smoothly until one of the
wagons was close to the football trophy
monument that stands near the cinder
track. Some enthusiast flaunted the
Stanford colors in the path of the on
coming team and the horses took
fright. Before the driver could control
the horses the long 'bus was partly
overturned, the pole broken and the
front wheels embedded in a trench at
the side of the road. The cardinal
players, "a trifle shaken up, sprang out
of the vehicle and walked the short dis

Paternalism In the Army.
General Corbin is so much pleased
with the reorganization of the army
upon the German model,- which has
brought him from the office desk to a
higher comr..and. that he would like to
extend the German military methods
still further and give the War Depart
ment paternal charge over the personal
affairs of army men. Particularly he
advocates the German rule that an
officer may not marry without official
consent, which is always conditioned
upon a satisfactory financial provision.
The army does not, It Is true, offer the
greatest advantages for .matrimony.
But when a young officer who wants to
marry Is obliged to consider the dot
which his wife will bring. him and to
submit his prospects to the considera
tion of the Secretary of "War, the United
States army will not be altered for the
better. They are getting .very tired of
this kind of paternalism In Germany.

Jimmy Whalen flashed the yellow
streak yesterday at Recreation Park
for the first time in his life. He quit
and sulked and the Siwashes got busy.
In the llrst round they hammered in
four runs. Three more were added in
the third, and that simply broke it up.
It was a shameful way for a pitcher
to act, and the fans were not slow to
fchow their disapproval. Score: San
Francisco :*., Seattle 10.
Whalen had some grievance, Â¦ and
when Van Haltren came to the bat In
the first round James did not even try
to locate the plate. Freeman popped
out, but this did no good, for Whalen
deliberately passed Delehanty. Frisk
then bit off a double to center, scor
iner Van. Then Leahy came up and
sot a base on balls Whalen showed
the real quitting signal when : Smith
stepped to the plate. He tossed him
up an easy one. The lanky youth lift
ed it over the center-field fence, bring
ing in Frisk and Leahy.
He managed to get away with
the second inning, but in round' S he
again get sulky, and this time the Si
washes pounded three more in. Had
not the San Francisco fielders given
the ungrateful pitcher grand support
the Siwashes would surely have scored
& dozen runs more. But their efforts
did not seem to do anything toward
making Whalen pitch, for he acted the
same old way in every round. The
score:

against the following dogs are: Val

Boy, 10; Charter Member, 10; Rocked
Asleep, 10; Tom King. 10; Richard
Anton. 10; Panoche, 10; Grafton, 12;
Lost Chord, 15; Tom Hooker, 15. and
La Rosa, 15. Few upsets were ex
perienced in the feature event. The
hares are strong, furnishing excellent
trials. Following are the day's re
sults, with Judge P. J. Reilly's official
scores:
The Eastern dogs showed up well.
Cranberry Sauce, Kalispel and Graf
ton won their courses In clever style.
Wild Turkey and Quicksand were de-
Jeated in the big stake, but won their
trials in the purse stake. Graf ton is
a dog of class. He led Duhallow a
length and showed cleverness. Kalis
pel defeated Friendless Boy, which
was figured as a probable winner of
the cup.
Nethercotfs dogs appear to be
overtrained. They did not show the
snap they usually do. It is probable
they have been given too severe a.
course of work. Barge had a hard
course, which injured his chance for
first honors. McVey defeated Rector
and showed he is ready. He will un
doubtedly lead his opponents in to
day's trials. New Home Boy, the Los
Angeles representative, showed much
class. He will be hard to beaL The
talent has made Valley Pride favorite
in the Jong odds book. She opened at
12, but her backers forced the odds
down to 6. She is in a good position,
but will meet a hard one in Grafton
in the second round.
One round of the John Grace chal
lenge cup, the richest coursing event
of this country, was run at Union
Coursing Park yesterday and a round
of the purse for dogs beaten in the
cup event was finished. The dogs
beaten in the purse stake will meet
also, leaving- three stakes to be com
peted to-day.

v^ vV v\v\ ' The 'whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you
vS^J. \ v^vÂ» .lose that by draining the system in any manner, my Belt will replace it and cure you. â¢
Mr Harry U. Jackson Valleton. Cal.. writes: "Althouch you are a stranrcr to me, my heart warms toward you as a Â«rrÂ»at benefactor and friend, and I am tnorÂ» than
rrateful to' you. Already I feel the vlcor of new life in my body; no aches and no pains. I wish' you every success In your work."
Letters like that tell a story which means a <great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from
useless doctoring. I get such letters every day. . i
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy. I
Louise King, Commercial Hotel, San Francisco, says : "I take pleasure In dropping; you a few lines to let you know how jxeatly Improved I am since I rot your Belt. My
headaches have left me and I am gaining | n welarht. I feel like a different woman, and am very grateful to you fw all the good your Belt has done me."
I make tlie best electrical body appliance in the world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after
everything else has failed are my best arguments. ;<'â¢Â¦.? â¢* ' ~ I
Mr. Roy Burk. McKlttrlck, Cal., writes: "From the first night I wore the belt I felt new HfÂ© In every part of my body. The weakness wa^wfchecked Immediately, and I am
now able to do heavy work without tiring. I am glad I thought of the belt, for In no other way could the money bring me so much pleasure."
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, chest or side. Sciatica in
his hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any ache or pain, and my Belt will pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain.
No pain can exist where my Belt is worn. 'Â»?."; \
Mr. J. L. Balrd of Orland, Cal.. writes: "My back Is entirely well, and I would not take $100 for my belt If I could not get another. It U the best thing on earth for a Â¦
lame back." Â».' *'" . '
And these "old" men, these men who have burned the candle at both ends â or even if they haven't â these men who for one reason or another
feel that life has lost its spice, that they are getting old too fast, I can make them feel the sparkle and fire of youth apain.
I'll never forget when Mr. A. Crawford of Pokegama,. Oregon, an old man of seventy, wrote to me and said: "When I wrote to you fast I
told you to send me a Belt to make 1 an old man young, and you did. I am seventy years old, and since I have worn the Belt I feel as' strong. as I
did at thirty-five, and can do as good a day's work as I could at that age." It was two years ago that Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here is
one I just got from him:
"In reply to your letter I am glad to say that I am just as much In favor of your Belt as I ever was, for It has been a remarkable help to me. I am seventy-two years old. but
I do not look any more than fifty. Affl enjoying perfect health, and will continue to recommend the Belt, as I have been doing right along, as I realize that but for It I should have
been dead and burled by this time."
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not cures by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt.
Men and women 'who had tried their home doctors and every known medicine have come to me and been cured.
Mr. T. Taserchl, 121 Halght St.. Ban Francisco. Cal., says: "No words can express my feeling of gratitude to you. When I received your marvelous Belt I was fn a very
bad condition physically. I was nervous, weak, digestion Â¦ was poor.' I couldn't sleep but two or three hours tn the night, my mental power was weak, though I had been naturally
very strong, and all these symptoms wers the result of a sexual weakness. Now I am well, and I am glad to have this opportunity to recommend the Belt to these who suffer from
such troubles as mine, for they will be restored to perfect health by_your Belt."
Now, what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you ought to be, can you ask any better proof to make you try It? Is there a rem-
edy which Is as simple, as easy to use. as sure to cure and as cheap as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not soen one. You must try it In justice to
yourself, and to those who look to you for their future happiness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not be delayed.
It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle glowing heat from it constantly, but no sting, no burn-
Come and see me if you can. I have a private consulting room in which I will explain my method of treatment, and, perhaps, give you the names of some
of your friends whom I have cured.
w Send for my beautiful "book full of things a man likes to read if he wants to be a strong man. I send it, sealed, free. If you are a weak woman send for
my book, "Maiden, "Wife and Mother," which shows the road to health and happiness for weak woman. Cut out and send this ad.

From the Boston Standpoint.
The warmth of the West comes
mainly from her newness; because she
Is new she still has the roaring
cameraderie of the pioneer days when
frontiersmen looked to on? another not
only for companionship, but for de
fense against the hazards of a precari
ous existence which would have made
eyclusiveness well nigh suicidal.
Boston, on the other hand, long ago
outgrew her municipal baby clothes
and we have totally lost the pioneer
spirit that once was ours. The city
la built to stay and with It we also
stay unto the third and fourth genera
tion. Our friends flew kites with usÂ»,
r*ad Virgil with us, came to our wed
dings and will lay wreaths on our
tombs- Indeed, we have, in the nat
ural course of things, rather more
friends than we think we needr so why
collect others. We do not lay siege
to one another, and we do not much
care to be besieged by others. It ia
not our game.â Alnslie's.

fish, either herring, caplln or squid,
that the cod affects. The trawls are
anchored, at each . end. baited in the
day, left lying overnight, and are
stripped of their accumulation of fish
next morning, being baited again when
"ovehauled."
The fish are taken to the vessels In
the dories, eviscerated, washed and
salted. TWs routine continues until
the bait Is exhausted, and then the
vessel returns home, lands the fish,
takes more bait and â¢ salt and goes
out again. At St. Pierre her eatch Is
taken in hand by the gravlers and
women, who submerge it In their
crates until the salt has been washed
off. Then thev scrub each fish with a
hard, coarse brush and pile them in
heaps to drain. This done, they are
next spread on the beaches dry in
the sunlight and , air. The beaches
consist, of -several acres .of flat ground
HOW CODFISH -ARE CAUGHT
AROUND NEWFOUNDLAND
A certain large landowner In Rus
sia Is making a study of the migratory
hxbits of birds. To all those he can
capture he attaches a note in P.uasian.

whoever may find or kill them to let
him know the country to which thÂ«7

Fierce Old Caged Lion . Recognizes
Mate's Cry For Help and
Releases Keeper.
An appealing cry for assistance, ut
tered by an African lion to Its mate
while fighting with several others of
Asiatic breed, saved the life of Caotam
Jack Bonlvita recently, when he was
attacked by Baltimore in a cage at
Coney Island. Captain Bonivlta. who Is
now a patient in the Brooklyn Hospital,
where the doctors are endeavoring to
save his hand, which was crushed and
poisoned by Baltimore's jaws, attri
butes bis escape, from death to the cry
which diverted Baltimore's attention.
On the night in July when Bonivlta
was attacked, he entered the cage with
no suspicion of unusual danger. The
animals were working well, although
they -were a trine fractious. The act
was going as usual until Baltimore.
who is old and always a bit ugly, began
wandering about the cage. Bonlvita

covered with basalt stones worn round
by the motion of the sea for ages.
These stony fields surround St.
Pierre, and thousands of cod are dis
played there on a fine day. Every
evening, or if fog or rain threatens,
the fish are gathered up again and
covered with tarraullns. The process
is repeated until the fish are quite
dry and hard. Dry fish are piled In
round stacks, the rest In oblong opes.
When a sufficient quantity to load a
vessel is obtained It is packed Into
her hold and shipped to market. The
extent cf the codflshlng of Mlguelon
and St Pierre may be indicated by the
record of the catch of those islands In
1002, which was 73.500,000 pounds. â

cracked his whip at the brute, and
turned his attention to driving the
beast back to his place In line with
his comrades.
Baltimore with sullen obedience slunk
along the edge of the cage followed by
his master and the dreaded whirx Sud
denly the lion turned, and leaoir.^
upon Bonlvlta. drove him to the bars.
Instinctively, when attacked. Bonlvita
threw up his whip arm to protect b!a
throat. Baltimore's jaws fastened uson
his hand and the lion's teeth sank Into
bis flesh, crushing the bones.
Bonivtta was powerful. Ptnioned to
the bars he could not tear himself free
without sacrificing; his hand, and
throwing himself open to even greater
danger. He could only stand facing tha
lion and await the brute's next move.
Suddenly the hippodrome ransr with
a pierctcs roar. A Cght had started
among the other lions while BonlvltÂ«i
was occupied with Baltimore's attack.
Two Asiatics had attacked Baltimore's
mate, an African Hon. and the latter
called for help. Baltimore looked for
a moment into his master's eyes, .then
turned his head toward his mate.
Dropping Bonivlta's hand, he rushed
to his mate's assistance, and Bonivita's
life was saved.
. Captain Bonlvlta Is Cm in the belief
that it was that cry for assistance that
saved his life, and he is equally certain
that Baltimore's response to the aooeal
has established beyond a doubt the,
existence not only of a lan^ua^e of the
lions, but of a patois spoken in African
jangles, that Is not understood by the
Asiatics.

The girls we love is the text of this article â the most beantifal eirls ia
the world to our eyes. They have more grace, more charm, more sod,
more womanliness than all the women in the world. Artists have paint-
ed them as they saw them. We have our own ideals, which may be dif-
ferent, may be more or less lovely ta other men; but they are ideals for
which we straggle strenuously.
Bryson has his ideal. She is very piquant. We admit her charm. We
admit her loveliness. And then we say in this er that feature she lacks
the stroerlative charm of one woman. What we find lacking in Brvson's
portrait or Gibson's portrait, or Strauss* portrait of the American Girl,
the artist may not consider worth while.' He may say: **Yes, she lacks
just THAT, but she has THIS."
It is that difference in taste which allows so much happiness in the
world. We don't all want the same American GirL There are American
Beauties which satisfy every taste.
Some are strong, fearless creatures, full cf life and daring. Others are
slighter, more gentle and not as fond cf events.. Others are home keep-
â¢ ing, housewifely creatures.
Not too bright or good v
For human nature's daily food.
Some are gay and winsome, dependent, alluring, frivolous. But of
whatever land, we know that the variety â American beauties â is best.
See Bryson's ideaL It is a painting of a lovely girl just budded into
womanhood. She is full cf life and sparkle. All the glad days lie before
her; she does not consider the many happy days that have passed. They
have clothed her with gayety. That was their oSce. She glances at us over
a bouquet of rich red roses from which she has lifted her flower-like face.
We will not forget the American beauty who is nearer and dearer ia
earing with admiration on this face.
We stop cnlv at the call of beauty and wish to possess only the pic-
ture of such loveliness.
That is whv everv one will be elad to have the art picture, in many
colors, which The Call will give to all of its readers next Sunday â a faith-
ful copy in tone, drawing and COLOR of Bryson's idea of the American
girL â¢

Captain Gladding has been proprietor
of a small livery stable here for many
years and is in moderate circumstances.
When he left California the captain {
sold part of his ranch, but the remain
der, consisting of about ten acres, he
never disposed of.
According to Woodworth, the land !
has been sold several times Bince Cap- j
tain Gladding lc-ft it to take care of It- I
self, and part of it was to have been !
sold again recently. The attorney of I
the prospective purchaser found that j
more than fifty-five years ago the land 1
liad been deeded to Samuel Gladding,
but no record of its sale by Gladding j
could be found. This blocked negotia
tions and a lawyer was sent here to see
the old owner.
Captain Gladding, who is now nearly
SO years old, went to California in 184&.
He made money in mining and invested
It in a ranch some distance from the
then small city of San Francisco. He
managed this ranch for several years
and then returned to Bristol, where he
has since resided.
