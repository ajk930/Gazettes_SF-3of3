NATURAL CHILD WINS DECISION
Judge Ellsworth Says
Capitalist Was
Responsible.
Jurist A sks Woman 9s9 s
Consent to Amend
Complaint.
OAKLAND, Dec. Â».â An intimation
given by Judge Ellsworth to-day in re
gard to the decision of the case of Eliza
beth Lloyd Nix, the natural child of the
late Charles R. Lloyd, the capitalist,
against the other heirs for a child's share
in his estate valued at $363,000 indicates
that the case Is to be decided for the
woman.
Lloyd acknowledged her as his child,
but she -r-as practically disinherited after
he had promised, it is asserted, she should
share with his other children in the dis
tribution of his weath.
"If ever a man was morally responsible
for a child Charles R. Lloyd was for Mrs.
Nix and with very little other corrobora
tive evidence the plaintiff's case would be
established," said .Judge Ellsworth to
day.
He asked Attorneys Frank Powers and
M. C. Chapman, for Mrs. Nix, to amend
their complaint so as to more nearly con
â¢form to the evidence as testified to on the
stand, and allowed them to propose suit
able amendments over the objections of
\V. S. Goodfellow, representing the Lloyd
heirs.
Judge Ellsworth then continued the
case until these amendments can be prop
erly engrossed. The deductions drawn
from his remarks and actions Is that his
decision, now ready to be handed down,
will be for the plaintiff In the action. By
such a r decision Mrs. Nix will be entitled
to about $50,000 out of the total amount.
EQUESTRIENNE
IS HURLED TO
SUDDEN DEATH
Young Miriam TayJor's
Horse Runs Away
in Alameda.
ALJVMEDA. I>ec. 29.â Miriam Taylor.
16 years of age and the only child of
former State Senator E. K. Taylor of
Alameda, was thrown from a saddle
horse this evening on Central avenue,
near liigh street, receiving injuries
\u25a0which caused her death three hours
. later.
MisÂ« Taylor was returning from Oak
land with a party of friends and was
riding a horse owned by Miss Alama
Sevening. who resides at 2438 Central
avenue. As the party was riding up
Central avenue the animal ridden by
'Miss Taylor became unruly, and the
young woman, who was an expert
equestrienne, gave him his head and
let him run.
Near High street the horse suddenly
swerved to the side of the street and
â¢ ran under a row of trees, the low
" hanging branches of which swept Miss
Taylor from her paddle and she was
hurled across the curb, striking on her
head on a cement sidewalk and frac
turing her skull. The horse ran up
Central avenue to the Latham stables,
where it was kept, and its appearance
riderless in the stable caused an imme
diate search to be made for its rider.
Edward Hill, an employe of the
stable, discovered Miss Taylor lying
senseless on the ground, and, carrying
her to the stable, at once notified Sen
ator Taylor, who had his daughter re
moved to the- \Alameda Sanitarium,
where Dr. G. B. Reynolds was called to
attend her. She failed to respond to
treatment, however, and died at 9:20
o'clock.
Miss Taylor was one of l the best
known members of the younger social
set of the Encinal City, of which she
was a native. She was a student of the
Alameda High-School and was prom
inent in all the athletic pastimes of
the feminine students of the school.
During her father's terms as State
Senator Miss Taylor always accom
panied him to Sacramento, and she had
many friends in that city. I
Immediately after the doath of his
daughter her fcther ordered the re
mains removed to the Taylor home at
:M5O Central avenue. Mfss Taylor would
have graduated from the high school
in the spring, and her father had al
ready made plans for her entrance into
a finishing .Â«chool. Besides her father,
the young girl leaves a grandmother,
Mrs. <xober. who lives at College Park,
near San Jose. No arrangements' have
been made for the funeral.

V NEW YORK, Dec 29.â During the last
<?cene of "Die Gotterdammerung'.' in > the

burning alcohol fell from, a torch carried
by a woman of the chorus and. formed a
mass of fire near the front of the stage,
where it lay for several seconds, threat
ening both a conflagration and a panic in
the house.
At the critical instant Mme. Nordica, in
the midst of her. singing as Brunnhilde,
stepped forward ' with great daring and
presence of mind and trod upon \ the
flames, setting fire to the " edge of â¢ har
skirt and scorching and burning her san

The deed vas one of extreme peril- for
the prima donna,* who was^ clad in long,
sweeping white draperies, and. was her-

and women , in . the audience gasped
asi; they .saw her, still singing,
standing directly,, over the . flames,
which could be seen shooting through her
flimsy draperies. It seemed as if in an
other moment the singer, must be en
veloped in flames. â¢ Vigorousls', stamping
on the fire, and at the;same time grasp-
Ing with her disengaged hand-' the burn-
Ing corner, of her skirt, Mme. \u25a0 Nordica
conquered the flames. .
Instantly there was a burst of thun
derous applause from the house as it was
realized that the prima donna, had avert

during the accident had ! Mmc, Nordica
stopped singing/. The passage during
which the, fire started is: one. of . the'big

widow of the late Judge J." A: Campbell
of San Francisco became the \ wife ,of
George H. Jamison, but recently released
from San Quenfin prison. Is about to be
blighted by a prosecution forUblgamy.
'Jamison was married in 1893 to Miss Anna
Thompson and they, lived together hap
pily for several years at Wapello,; lowa,
where two sons' were born.' v
Meeting financial reverses,- Jamison be
came involved in some financial entangle
ments and â¢ was Arrested -on : several suc
cessive occasions on charges of obtaining
money under false pretenses," for i which
he served short terms at Burlington -and
Galesburg. He later' went , to the.Philip
pines, -having enlisted /at San ; Francisco.
From Manila .he wrote . several I times â¢\u25a0, to
his wife, telling of his. love and inquiring
about his children.; â¢/ ;. . -, ..,'..-': :
Returning .j to America after - : his dis

she . set rhim up ,in': business In Berkeley
and a few months later : became, his wife. |
"Soon after this Jamison, learned that the
wife j he- had not \ seen for years I and . the
mother, of his two sons Intended ' to seek
a divorce. ;He x hurried; to , Omaha, j where
his advances : were spurned. 'â He sought in
vain . to persuade wife â¢;. No. 1 " to' return
with him : to "California, promising -her/a
comfortable home and displaying photo
graphs of. the^ furniture house at Berkeley
of which he was manager, and unfolding
large rolls of bills as evidence that what
he promised he could ; fulfill. . It was all
in vain, however, and on the day that
his wife filed her petition for a divorce
last month he filed his answer, acknowl
edging every allegation except that of de
sertion,, and 'also agreed to pay the costs
of the suit. v
This was about five weeks ago. Since
then. Mrs. Jamison the first has learned
of her husband's marriage in . Califor

never been divorced from his first wife.'
He said:
"Papers in my former wife's divorce

- SEATTLE, Dec. 29.â Mose Goldsmith,
theatrical' booking: agent and owner of
the Standard Theater of this* city, was
held up in a room of the Lincoln Hotel;
one of the most fashionable hostelries
in Seattle, this afternoon by a ' man
who gave his name as Burke and made
to pay; over, $2750. Itwasone of the
boldest and best planned tricks ever
turned in this city.
; Yesterday. Goldsmith received a tele
phone message from Burke, who stated
that' he had a proposition \o make. A
meeting was arranged in an uptown of
fice. Burke stated. he was ; from; Butte,
Mont., and owned a half interest in the
Miner of that city. He said he 4 had
$18,000 to invest and would like to buy
an interest in Goldsmith's" theatrical
business. He showed what purported
to< be a draft on the Butte Miner for
tlfat amount. Goldsmith said he would
sell him an Interest in his two vaude
ville theaters in { this city for, that
amount. It was agreed: that Goldsmith
should have the papers drawn up ; by
his attorney.': ' \u0084Â« ;, . l . \u0084:
.vJ.To-day, Goldsmith, received- ;a .tele
phone call from' Burke at â¢ tfie>Uncoln
.Hotel. .-ask in s him- to come up.and.tallt
over the tleal. Goldsmith and \u25a0"ari'jejn-'v
"ploye" named \ Cohen .went up, ; going a
room on the top floor. 7 \u25a0 Thsy 'were rinet
Burke, .who stated' that he .wished
to talk to Goldsmith personally.. Cohen
"went to the officer and; Goldsmith re
mained with Burke. ' The. first thing
the latter did, after Cohen left was to tell
Goldsmith to read a letter lying oh a
table in the room. This letter,, stated
that Burke needed $2760 very badly
and if Goldsmith did not "come
through" with that amount^ his head
would be shot off. - Goldsmith turned to
his companion and looked down the
barrel of a revolver.
WRITES "OUT CHECK.
"Write out a check for the amount,"
commanded. Burke, "and send the hotel
clerk to the bank far the money â $500
in gold and the balance in $100 bills."
Goldsmith did as ho was told and called
up 'Cashier. Lane of. the Scandinavian
Bank to say the check was all right and
pay the same, as directed. The hotel
clerk, F. R. Fleming, was called to the
room, Burke 'keeping Goldsmith covered
and. shielding the gun from Fleming's
sight. After Fleming had gone Burke told
Goldsmith, to order drinks for two, which
he did, and after the clerk returned with
the money he ordered two more, for
which he made Goldsmith pay. Pocketing
the ' money, . Burke informed Goldsmith
that he was a gentleman and shook hands
with him. | He. also said he would not take
Goldsmith's diamonds. He then made
Goldsmith go into the bathroom, . and
warned him to make no outcry for fifteen
minutes. . He then locked the door and
left. After waiting for about ten minutes
Goldsmith began yelling and attracted
the \u25a0 attention :of a woman in the : next
roomi The porter was sent for and Gold
smith was liberated. â¢
THIEF MAKES ESCAPE. -
The police; were notified immediately
and detectives placed on tbe,<^se. - Gold
smith describes .Burke as being of me
dium height and fairly well ; dressed. His
hair and mustache were jet black and his
eyes light blue, which causes } Goldsmith
to think he was disguised. Two trains on
the Great Northern and Northern Pacific
left - the city at 4 o'clock, ~ and the police
believe Burke'eaughVorie or the other. .
I Cashier Lane of | the' Scandinavian Bank
telegraphed to: Butte and learned that no
such man as Burke had any interest what
ever in the Miner.; Chief Delaney. says it
is the cleverest piece of work In the his
tory of the department.

.London early in the" fall. His condi
tion had been ' critical for ten days past
an* the attending physicians gave up
a.H hope several days ago, although
members of the family clung to the be
lief that the remarkable vitality of
Yerkvs would pull him through. Since
last night the patient had been kept
uJive by strong stimulants.
'Despite statement* said to have come
earlier in the day from Mrs. Charles.
T. Ytrkes. wife of the capitalist, that
the would not go to the Waldorf-As
to'ria, the following official statement
was made, by Dr. Loomis, -who had at
tended Yerkes throughout his illness:
"At the deathbed were Mrs. Charles
T. Ycrkes, his wife; Charles Edward
Yerkes, a son, and his wife; Mrs.
Charles R. Miller, a daughter, and my
self."
Â°At 11 o'clock Mrs. Yerkes was in
formed by telephone that her husband
was dying- and she relented and went
to the hotel and was present when he
died. This was the first time Mrs.
Yerkes had been at the hotel during- her
husband's illness. Death was peace
ful. Yerkes' residence is at Slxty
tigrhth street and Fifth avenue.
Speyer & Co., the New York banking
llror. which had much to do with the
local financing of Yerkes' affairs, to
day made the following statement:
"The death of Mr. Yerkes is particu
larly s;ad, coming- at a time when his
great work in connection with the Lon
don underground was rapidly ap
proaching completion and important
portions of it were being put in opera
tion.
"Mr. Yerkes 1 failing health had warn
ed him and the bankers associated with
the enterprise that arrangements should
be made for relieving him of a portion
of his work or for completing it and
carrying it out in case of his death.
The arrangements have been perfected
:md will be announced at the proper
time." â¢
Coincident with Yerkes' death, it was
learned from one of his business asso
ciajes that he had bequeathed to the city
his mansion on Fifth avenue, together
with the great art galleries in connection
with it. the whole to be maintained by
an endowment of J1.000,000. At least three
of the paintings are worth close to $100,000
apiece and many others are almost
equally valuable.
Although the precise terms of Yerkes'
will have not been made known, it is
Mated that provision has been made to
jiroviile for Mrs. Yerkes, in such a man
ner as to cause her to forego her dower
rights of one-third interest in the prop
erty. '-,; â¢ â¢ '
Provision has been made not only for
the maintenance of the collection of
paintings as it stands, but for c steady
increase along lines mapped out by its
founder, the selection of new works of art
to be in the hands of trustees named by
Yerkfts, or to be chosen by his execu
tors.
What will be the disposition of the
53.000.000 to 510,000.000 of which he is be

to the value of his art objects and his

Charlr-s Tyson Yerkes, of International
fame as a broad financier and strc-et rail
way promoter, was a man of varied and
picturesque experience. He was "born in
Philadelphia, Pa., June 25, 3537. The Yer
kes family was of Dutch origin, the first
settlers of the name coming to America
a few years before the advent of WII-
Jiam Perm's Quaker colony.
Young Yerkes was educated in the
Friends" School and the *high school of
his native city and then began business

without salary, but received $50 as a pres

did a large and profitable business in na
tional. State and municipal securities.
His close connection with the city
finances, however, was the cause of the
great trouble of his life. He had long
been acting as broker for Marcer, the
City Treasurer, when the- latter was found
to be a defaulter to a large amount. The
two were indicted, tried and convicted.
Yerkes was. fined 5500 and sentenced to
two years and. nine months Imprisonment
This was February 10, 1572. At the end
of seven months, September, 1872, he was
granted full pardon and discharged from
custody.
For several years thereafter nothing
was heard in Philadelphia of the financial
genius and pardoned prisoner. He had
buried himself in the West and, it is said,
had temporarily abandoned the name of
Yerkes until he should recover from the
blow.
The story goes that no one in Philadel
phia heard of Charles T. Yerkes again
until, several years afterward, he ap
peared in Chicago.
He immediately entered the speculative
arena. Everything he touched seemed to
turn to gold. He had made large sums of
money in booming Fargo, N. D., and was
able to make a strong start on coming
to Chicago. -His first large move was to
open -a banking house (1SS1) at La Salic
and Madison streets. '-â¢"
Ih ISS6 " he began negotiations for the
control of the Chicago street railways
and with the assistance of Chicago capi
talists and some Philadelphia friends soon
obtained control of the Chicago City Rail
way Company, which was reorganized

adopted ss motive power. Two years
later he secured control of the Chicago
West Division Railway Company. He be
came a factor in the Chicago Elerated
Railroad systems in 1837 and formed the
Union Loop Company to provide terminal
facilities for all the roads in the heart of
the city. He then branched out and built
over 250 miles of suburban roads as feed
ers to his several intermural systems.
In 1901 he went to London and became
interested In solving the great problem of
quick and safe passenger transportation
in the world's populous metropolis. This
he did in a way -that astonished the Lon
doncifc, planning and completing in an
incredible short time a vast system of un
derground or "tube" roads.
Mr. Yerkes accumulated a large fortune,
even as fortunes are measured now, but
he was not a money maker only, but a
man of liberal culture and artistic dis
crimination. He was one of the board of
directors of the Columbian Exposition in
1593 and a member of the committee on
fine arts, and to his efforts was largely
due the elaborateness and great success
of the exhibits in that department.
In his New York residence, a palatial
structure costing over $1,000,000, he gath
ered one of the most complete and costly
art collections in America. It is valued
at over 52,000,000.
He gave to the University of Chicago a

the bonds and her jewelry in a case and
hidden it in a bed. During the party the,

UNITED EMLEOADS
. BOND SUIT ENDED
Decision in Favor of Plain
tiffs Given by New
York Justice.
NEW, YORK, Dec. 20.â Justice Truax in
the State Supreme Court to-day handed
down a decision in favor of the plaintiffs
in the several actions brought by Zim
merman & Forshay of this city against
other firms, involving the alleged failure
of the defendants to deliver to the plain
tiffs certain bonds claimed to have been
issued by the United Railroads of San
Francisco and the United Railways In
vestment Company. Damages amounting
to ?1C,865 were awarded against the de
fendants as follows: 7 Hudson & Co..
$3550: Timmerman, Dahlgren & Co., |10,-
Cl 5; Weaver,' Rabourg & Co., $625; Bunnell
& Buchanan, $300; E. & C. Randolph,
$ISSO.
The question involved was/as .to wheth
er .'or Jioti the bonds', wereiissued on or
prjor to July T, 1902. *,The defendants took
the. ground that the contracts had not
matured because the entire issue of
bonds, amounting to $20,000,000 had, not
been put on the market at the time. Jus
. tico Truax holds that a sufficient number
of bonds were on the market July 7, 1902,
to fill the defendants* contracts and
could be bought in the open market both !
in New York and San Francisco.
An appeal will be taken, as It is claimed
several other large suits,- Involving con
tracts for the ,' delivery of bonds, "when,
if, and as issued," depend upon the final
decision in the present, case.
the largest and finest In the worldâ which

Yerkes was twice married, first when he
was a broker m Philadelphia, and again
In 1881, when he had become a power in
Chicago. The first wife, whom he left
behind when he was released from prison
and went West In 1572, he divorced after
making ample provision for her future
comfort. ' His second wife was Miss Ade
laide Moore of Philadelphia, whom he
met In the West before he went to Chi
cago to settle. .
With one exception every one of Yerkes'
predictions for himself came true. His
social success ' In Chicago did not keep
pace with his other conquests. He and
his wife were received' with open arms
abroad and were given much recognition
in New Yoik, but in Chicago theynever
reached the top rung of the social ladder.
It is said that that _was one reason why
Yerkes deserted Chicago for New York.
In June, 1891, he erected in Greenwood
Cemetery, New York, at a cost of $50,000,
a magnificent tomb to receive the remains
of himself and wife on their demise.
REVOLT AT MOSCOW CRUSHED
BY TROOPS OF THE CZAR.
GENERAL STRIKE IS CRUMBLING
Kussian Government. Will Now Give Attention to the
'â¢â¢Â£: .Growing Trouble in the Baltic Provinces;
ST.- PETERSBURG, Dec. 29.â The sup
pression of the insurrection at Moscow
and the certainty jthat similar uprisings
elsewhere, will.^be {crushed marked- the
collapse' of. the ' first attempt of the
"Reds" to overthrow the â¢ Government
armies and administers a defeat from
which, it Is > believed'' ifr Government cir
cles, the revolutionaries cannot quickly
recover.' :; ;^ ' '
Now that the smoko of battle'is clear
ing a, way :,the utter hopelessness of the
conflict seems to be apparent. Thepopu- :
lace held aloof and not; a single , military
Unit J actually 'joined the revolutionaries.'
Even' the general 1 strike crumbled under
their feet by their . challenging and pre
cipitating , a conflict \u25a0 before the proleta
riat, organizations, were prepared.
The 'Government, secured a compara
tively easy/though ruwless victory, and;
it is believed "in "high "official circles that
the organizations^ have Deen jso demoral
ized and disrupted by, the blow and by the
arrest of their most-able leaders that it
will ba^impossible, for them to attempt
the coup planned _for the anniversary of
"bloody â¢ Sunday." In desperation, un
douÃtedly, the revolutionaries wiir again
have â¢ recourse to acts of terror, which
they spring at the most unexpected mo
ment. ; j ;iUvfÂ£. â¢
The country has quieted down and the
Cabinet now hopes- that the election of a
Douma is assured; that tne Government
,can devote its time to theÂ«suppression of
the ; revolt in { the , Baltic provfnceÃ and
more especially to the solution of the
"agrarian question. If means cannot be
found to Jn some measure satisfy the
land hunger of the peasants before spring
the, universal opinion is that the peasants
everywhere will rise. The ' landed pro
prietors seem to be convinced of this to
such. an extent that the landlords in the
neighborhood of .Minsk are calling their
tenants together and are voluntarily ar
ranging the distribution of a portion of
their private holdings upon terms satis
factory to the peasants.
Peter Struve, editor of "the Osvobojdenie
(emancipation), -who has again shifted his
position, publishes a ringing article- this
afternoon, in which he admits the defeat
of the attempt aimed at the overthrow
of the Government. He says the attempt
of course was madness, and was bound
to be extinguished â¢ in blood. Neverthe
less, he allegss, there was a heroic spirit
behind it which should terrify the Gov
ernment. "Another such victory and the
Government Is'lost," says he.
The report that Lieutenant Mistchenko
has been. woutlded is not true.
The League of Leagues has split, one
portion favoring a continuance of â¢' the
strike and another' the abandonment of
violent tactics and co-operation in peace
ful preparation for the work of the
Douma. "..- .
With the evident object of inflaming
sentiment abroad the revolutionary agents
are putting out a story, to tha effect that
the Government, is deliberately, -plotting
a.'' great ; massacre of. the Jews. ' >These
agents display what purports to be the
text of an appeal by. a rabbi /addressed
to the* Jews to flght against the cross,
which, they declare is, being printed by
the; Ministry of .Marine for distribution
among the ignorant plasses, with the ob
ject of produciisg a' concerted attack. In T
vestigation fails 'to substantiate i
charge that the Government is favoring
any such document. Tnere was a slight

have organized themselves Into a small
army and daily parade the streets headed
by a band of music playing the "Mar

have appeared. At Samora, near Nizhni

town, 20,000 workmen arose and attempted
to march on Nizhni Novgorod, but. were

of the troops entered the hall with a
company of infantry and announced
to- the revolutionists that they were
surrounded. He asked them to dis

however, had already-escaped through

Put an End to the
Protectorate.
Special Dispatch to The Can.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â According to
representations that have been made to
the State Department by W. L. Bass and
other American sugar planters in Santo
Domingo, the authorities on the island.
Â« who have received the sympathy and sup
port cf President Roosevelt to an unusual
â¢ degree, are furnishing additional reasons
to the Senate for smashing the protec
torate.
* There are twelve large sugar planta
tions on the island, representing, it is
â¢claimed, an investment of $6,000,000, and
. all their product is being held from ex
' port through newly enacted laws and old
" decrees revived, under which they are
being oppressed and threatened with
"financial loss. Recently a decree, of the
Dominican Government was promulgated
and signed by Vice President Caceres in
.the absence of Morales empowering the
Dominican authorities to seize and sell at
' 'public auction any property, real or per
sonal, belonging to any person or corpora
.tion whatsoever within the national do
tiiain upon the simple intimation of a dep
â¢ uty of the Government alleging that the
owner or owners of the property have
â¢ "failed to pay their taxes. There is no di
rect tax upon land or real estate in Santo
â¢ Domingo, and the Government's only
revenue besides the custom houses is that
v.hich is squeezed out of such industries
'as may be able to produce something for
export. Through the changes in the ad
ministration several tax decrees were is
â¢ sued, but not enforced and became dead
I letters, although not repealed.
'. When Morales suddenly found himself
proclaimed provisional President the first
problem, which confronted him was how
to raise money. He was not long In dig
ging up an unrepealed law of the Vas
<iuez and Wos y Gil administrations levy
ing a tax upon the manufacture of sugar,
â¢and he proceeded to collect this tax upon
all the sugar which had been manufac
â¢ lured, during the previous two admlnis
.tratiens. The planters protested and Mo
. rales showed a disposition to compromise.
â¢He needed $15,000. and that at once. The
: planters, thinking to settle this. matter of
taxation, agreed "to pay Morales the
amount asked, providing he would decree
' n new law exempting sugar from taxa
tion for a period of twenty years. Mo
rales agreed. The 515,000 was paid and the
decree promulgated exempting sugar from
further taxation for the stated period.
Scarcely had the revolution against
Morales been put down than his Cabinet
proclaimed a new decree imposing a new
tax of 22 cents per hundred weight upon
the exportation of sugar. Later a cargo
of sugar was seized and ihe Government
was forced to repeal the 22-cent tax and
substitute the old tax of 10 cents on the
manufacture of sugar, whether for ex
port cr not. Then the Government is
sued a decree authorizing any Sheriff,
upon the simple notification of a primary
court, to seize the property of a delin
quent taxpayer wherever found and sell
the same to pay the alleged taxes and cx r
pense of seizure and sale, without re
course to law. Thus the entire sugar
<*rop of Santo Domingo is threatened.
\u25a0 The Dominican Government complains
that Bass, whose sugar crop Is held up,
has been active in Dominican politics and
aided' the revolution against Morales.

TEACHER CLOSE THEIR SESSIONS
AFTER FOUR DAYS OF GOOD WORK
Attitude Declared on Many of.
the School Work Problems.
New Educational Ideas Mark
the Great Convention.
The greatest State teachers' convention ever held in Cali
fornia was closed at Berkeley yesterday afternoon. The sessions
have been marked by discussions by noted scholars on new edu
cational methods. Advanced ideas were promulgated in large
measure and the teachers were greatly benefited. The association
will meet next year at Fresno.
"Good-by. I'll meet you next year at
Fresno."
A few hurried words of parting and
the convention of the California Teach
ers' Association, which has been meeting
at Berkeley the past four days,
was brought to a close yesterday^ after
noon. The'flna.l session was one of busi
ness, and was hurried through, so that it
might be closed on schedule time. Next
year the 7000 teachers and others inter
ested in education will gather at Fresno.
The session of the California Teachers'
Association which closed jesterday has
been the most successful meeting in the
history of the organization. Three times
as many teachers as ever before were
gathered at the convention. The Califor
nia Library Association and the State
Farmers' Institute met with the teachers,
to the advantage of all. Prominent men
and women from other States were pres
ent to address the meetings and give to
California the benefits of their experi
ences. Topics of vital import were dis
cussed by those who have made a life
study of "different k'nds of school work,
and new ideas of every sort were promul
gated among the teachers. Demonstra
tions of teachers' methods gave practical
illustrations of the worth of Ideas. All
this and much more was accomplished in
the four days' sessions. It was a conven
tion or" great benefit to the teachers of
California, and in a measure preparatory
to the great National Educational Con
vention, which meets next year in San
Francisco.
DISCUSS SCHOOL PROBLEMS.
The afternoon general session was the
most important meeting of yesterday. A.
E. AVinship, In a powerful speech, pointed
out the value of initiative on the part of
the individual. L. D. Harvey told of the
scope and purpose of an industrial edu
cation in the public school system. At
the close of the session strong resolu
tions declaring the principles of the
Teachers' Association were read and
adopted. These resolutions took up the
present school problems, declared against
the overcrowding of the schools and the
present method of securing textbooks, ap
proved the child labor laws and asked
that the salaries be increased. An inci
dent during the adoption of the resolu
tions was the speech of Miss J..C. Coffee
of San Francisco, who objected to the
word "men." She stood up for the rights
of the. women, as well. . The resolutions
are as follows: .
We. the teachers of California. In the State
Teachers' Association together assembled, do
hereby declare and adopt the following educa
tional principles as expressing the general con
sensus of opinion of the teachers of this State:
We hereby reaffirm our belief that of all the
Institutions making for the unification of our
nation and the improvement of Boclety, the
American free public school holds and must
continue to hold the foremost place, and that
in consequence the future of our democratic in
stitutions in large measure rests with the
teachers in our schools. With this as a funda
mental belief, we hold that It 1b Important
that high standards be maintained for entrance
upon the work of teaching: that from time to
time, as conditions may warrant, standards
should be Increased, and that ultimately no one
should b? allowed to teach in any kind of a
public school who does not possess a liberal
education, and who has not been adequately
and professionally trained for the work of
teaching.
We again express our belief In the wisdom of
eupportlng our schools largely by State and
county taxation and In. the wisdom and Justice
of the apportionment law which secures to
every school district in this State a common
minimum - sum with which to maintain a
school. It Is our belief that one of the chief
reasons why the schools of California are so
good to-day Is that In this State we have
shared the burdens of taxation and have equal
ized the advantages of education, to a greater
degTee than has been done by most other
States.
We believe it to be a sound educational
principle that wherever a teacher is at work
or a child in school, be it in a city, town or
county district, both the teacher and the
child should have the benefit of close, personal,
adequate and professional supervision. The
city teacher and child are properly cared for,
and it is believed by the cities that the small
fraction spent for supervision gives big edu
cational returns on the investment. Our pres
ent system of county supervision Is in most
counties entirely inadequate to meet the needs
of the country school, and, we therefore ex
press our belief that the present movement
looking toward an improvement In our system
of rural school supervision Is a movement
which should meet with the approval of all.
We also bJlieve that, whatever the details of
the system which may be adopted, some ade
quate provision should be made for opening up
rural supervision as a career for men â a ca
reer for which a man might be warranted in
making thorough preparation, and which . hÂ»
might hope to enter wholly on a basis of
merit.
BELIEVE IX FREE EDUCATION.
We believe in a complete and unbroken sys
tem of public education extending from the
earliest school age to and through the State
University free and equally open to every child
in the State. To this end we urge that the
one remaining gap In our system of public
education be filled as soon as possible. We
have free primary and grammar schools
throughout the entire State. Our State Uni
versity Is free and equally open to all. High
School education, though, is only free to those
children who happerf to live In high school
districts, when It ought to/ be free to every
child in even' school district In this State. To
make It so, and to complete our State system
of free public education, we earnestly urge
that legislation be enacted which will require
the school district in which the child lives,
and not the parent, to assume the high school
tuition charge for such children of the district
as wish to secure the advantages of a high
school education.
We believe that the interests of the child,
for whom alone the schools exist, should be
the first consideration in the determination of !
all questions relating to the administration of
our schools. In so far as new legislation tends
to promote the interests .of the child It is
wise legislation; in so tar a* it does not it
is unwise legislation. â¢ BecaugJe of this belief
we favor better salaries for teachers, because
better salaries will not only keep . many tried
and efficient teachers from changing to other
occupations, but would also attract more men
and women of a desirable class, and particu
larly more men, to th<? teaching profession.
We believe in the opening up of school super
vision as a career for men, because this would
retain many of the more promising and pro
gressive teachers In the profession. r â¢
I We believe that the annual re-election for
all teachers should be abolished and . that
teachers should be retained in their positions
co long as they are competent and profession
, ally alive. To this end we heartily indorse
the puggested legislation proposed In the coun
cil of education, whereby all regularly elected
teachers Fball not be subjected to annual re
flection, but fhall continue: to hold their.posi
tion* continually until they shall be â¢ notified.
In writing, with reasons, ' that the school au
thorities wish to terminate the contract at
thÂ«> close of the school year. \u25a0
We also believe that there should be : some
general provision for decently relieving, from
the work of instruction i the old and faithful
teacher. \u25a0: who has ' devoted â¢ years of service â¢to
the training of future citizens for the > State;
but who. due, to advancing years. Is no longer
capable of rendering the service which com
munities now demand of teachers. '
We believe that the time has come rwhen at
least eight months of school ought -to be ' re
quired in every school district of this State.
â We believe in the etrlct enforcement of- the
compulsory education and the child | labor, laws.
We believe that fifty children, are too many
for on" teacher to instruct properly; and. that
Â«h* number should be reduced to forty, at most.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY^ DECEMBER 30, 1905:
\u25a0w ' ' - Â» .
w e believe that the great advantages of
manual training instruction, now enjoyed ex
clusively by the children of our cities, should
be extended to the boys and girls of the small
towns of our State.
We believe that - many, of our small rural
schools are lnerficient because oÂ£ isolation,
lack of numbers and too many classes, arid
that, wherever possible, \ a consolidation of
schools with the transportation of pupils would
be greatly in the interests of the better educa
tion of country boys and girls.
URGE HIGHER SALARIES.
j While recognizing the j existence of a short
jape of teachers for the elementary . schools of
this State, we feel that the question is purely
an economic one. which the taxpayers, and
not the teachers, ought to face and solve,
and that the standards for entering the teach
ing profession ought not to be lowered 'in con
sequence. There are two ways of \u25a0 putting
an end to this shortage. One is to lower the
standards and fill the schools with a class
of would-be teachers who are not now. allowed
to enter, our schools, and the other is for
school authorities to increase the yearly salary
of teachers so as to \u25a0 more nearly approximate
the salaries now paid' employes in other
branches of public or private service where
less education, professional training or skill
are required. Of the two solutions we believe
that the latter is the only one that can be
adopted ; with safety to our system of free
Dubllc education. -
We believe that the present method of se
curing textbooks for our schools, while" an
i lmorovemcnt over that of some years asro, is,
| nevertheless, not the best method of attaining
textbooks, and that is unnecessarily costly to
the taxnavere of this State. We believe that
if a committee on publicity were appointed
and this committee were to supply the tax
payers of this State with the real facts as to
the unnecessary cost: of the present system
that the plan of State publication would soon
be done away with and a system of free text
books, with much local option as to adop
tion?, would be substituted in its stead. -
We wish to place on record our appreciation
cf the Joint meeting of the Library Associa
tion of thla State with the teachers of the
State, and in particular our appreciation of th,e
recently inaugurated work of the State .LV
brary in sendine out traveling libraries tq
the small towns and rural communities of this
State. This bejdnnlng should meet | with 1 the
hearty support and co-operation of all teach
ers and school authorities, and the ..library
should be welcomed by the schoolmaster as a
valuable co-ordinate and co-operating institu
tion working for the improvement of educa
t.'cnal and social conditions throughout the
State. We hope soon to see the work extended
to loan 9 of carefully chosen' pictures and lan
tern slides, selected with a view to asalstlns
the work of instruction In our schools.
We look with" much favor on the movement
to provide agricultural Instruction for the
children of our rural communities, and we
hope ultimately to ; see such instruction given
in all of our rural schools. We feel, however,
that the addition of agricultural instruction
as a required part of our county courses of
study, at â¢ the present time, would hardly
Drove to be a valuable addition, and, we
earnestly recommend to the agricultural de
partment of our State University, to our State
Polytechnic School and to our State ; normal
schools that they carefully etudy the ' question
with a view to outlining the kind of work
which ought to be done and to instructing the
teachers as to how to do It. . . = .
W> welcome to this State the National Ed
ucational Association, which is to hold its
next tneetlnr in San Francisco in July, 1 and
we pledge the ; best efforts of the teachers of
this State to make the meeting a large and
a successful one. -
EL.L.WOOD P. CUBBERLBY,
Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions.
PRAISE FOR PRESIDENT BARR.
The following general resolutions
were adopted:

feeling of the teachers in State convention as
sembled, hereby wish to extend our sincere ap
preciation and heartfelt thanks

AGREE WITH MERRILL.
A lively meeting of the High School
Association was held in the morning.
The paper read by Principal George
A. Merrill declaring against high
school fraternities and stating that
the evils of football came from the
colleges and not the high schools fur
nished the opportunity for discussion.
High school fraternities were \ con
demned by : nearly all of the \ teachers
and the resolutions offered by Prin
cipal Merrill were made even more
strong by. stating that "It is unwise for
a high school teacher, to accept mem
bership in a student fraternity." Foot
ball was dlso discussed. W. A. Brew
er of StZ Matthew's- School 'said \ that
it was the spirit of the countryâ the
belief that â¢ success was to winâ
caused the trouble in j football. Prin
cipal. Merrill stated that he was not In
favor .jit': football as It Is played to
day, but that a modified game would
be. a" good thing for high school boys.

Several Students/ at Naval
Academy Must Answer for
Hazing at the Institution
ANNAPOLIS; Md., Dec, 29.â The second
day's session of the court-martial of Mid
shipman Trenmor Coffin Jr., for the haz
ing of Midshipman Kimbrough, began
this morning. The little courtroom at
the academy was full or spectators during
the day. The first witness on the stand
to-day was Midshipman Overdown Whit
meyer, the room mate of Kimbrough. He
was; introduced .by the prosecution to
refute the testimony reflecting on Kim
brough's truthf ulne&s. He said that he
had never heard Kimbrough' s reputation
for veracity questioned, and that In his
personal relations he had always found
Kimbrough entirely truthful.
E. S. 'Theall opened for the accused.
Lieutenant \ Commander Harrison, the
judge advocate, quoted from Wlnthrop
in military form in regard .to the rules
governing the introduction of evidence as
to a confession. He made no further re
marks,- and -the case was -given to the
oourt.
_ The record in the Coffin case will go to
Admiral Sands for his action, though
Theall, counsel for Coffin, has filed a re
quest that it be forwarded to the Secre
tary of the Navy- for review. In the
same communication he urges that a ver
dict of guilty, if rendered, beset aside;
and .that the navy regulations were dis
regarded by allowing Kimbrough to tes- :
tify when he could not identify the ac
cused.
The faot developed to-day, that In ad
dition to Midshipman Stephen Decatur
Jr., .charged with; hazing, another mem
ber of the graduating class Is under the
same charge and others will be brought
to trial under, like allegations.
Midshipman Decatur was, after a re
cess, brought before the same court which
had tried Midshipman;' Coffin, but his
counsel, E. S. Theall of Washington,
asked that a recess be taken until 2
o'clock to-morrow afternoon, and the re
quest was granted.
The other v midshipman of the graduat
ing * class- against â¢ whom charges of haz
ing have been . filed is Worthwelgh .' Fos
ter of New Albany, ". Ind. The specifica
tions have not been made public.
It iis also understood . that Carroll P.
Graves: of Spokane, Wash.,. Is under ar
rest, and that charges will be filed against
him. Nor is this case the end,. for it is
known that several other members of the
first class have received intimations that
they must answer, to the same charge in
the very near future.
> That the first-class men are, engaged in
hazing, a practice ~ hitherto ; left .to the
third class, is explained on the ground
that ' Admiral Sands' opposition to hazing
ha 3 arrayed the uj>per-class men against
him " tn a desperate ; attempt to save the
system at the academy. The mother men
at . the* institution ' are ', said to have taken
It : upon themselves \u25a0to keep the practice
alive, ' because ' they > thought themselves
less likely to be ; suspected, and ;they are
almost immune from reports by members
1 of their own class.

REAL ESTATE MAKES STRONG
ADVANCES DURING YEAR 1905
Thomas Mag.cc & oons Issue Circular bhowing
Great Gains Over Last Season's Sales.
Business and Residence Portions of City Indicate
Growth and Promise for Investors.
Interesting figures from the advance sheets of Thomas Magee & Sons' Real
Estate Circular show that the market has been very active during all of h; year
1905. The sales were almost three times as many as those of 1900. Residence and
business portions alike show great advances and promise for investors.
The following summary of real estate
transactions for 1905 Is from advance
â¢ heets of the San Francisco Real Estate
Circular, published by Thomas Magee &
Sons:
"There were 9504 sales of San Fran
cisco real estate recorded in 1905 for a
'total %>l $74,392,540. The highest pre
'Yious yearly totals of sales were the
figures for 1903, $47,710,157. The in
crease is therefore $26,682,383. or an
Increase of 56 per cent over the 1903
totals, 64 per cent over the totals for
I*o4 and 57 per cent over the totals
for ISO 2. As a means of comparison
with previous years we herewith ap
pend the figures for the last six years:

"The high level reached in the years
fnO2, 1&03 and 1904. when the yearly
Â«iiles averaged $47,000,000. plainly and
"forcibly marked the beginning of a
new era in San Francisco real estate,
not t nly for a higher level of prices,
but for an increasing volume of busi
ness. That the high level reached by
the real estate business done in 1902,
ISO 3 and 1904 marked thÂ«. beginning of
an era of greater growth and appre
ciation in values in San Francisco real
estate Is very clearly indicated by an
increase during 1905 of over 56 per
cent over the figures of 1902, 1903 and
1904. The number of sales recorded is
the largest by 2500 ever known.
"It is usual to chronicle the event of
the year in this review, but the re
markable fact that the immense total
of $74,392,540 has been reached with
practically no large sales to swell the
totals is in itself the event of events
of this year or any other year of San
Francisco's history. The feature of
the year has been the prices paid for
Market-street property. The investing
public has come to believe that not
only is there nothing better than Mar
ket street for permanent investment,
but it has apparently reached the
conclusion that there is nothing as
good even at the advancing prices paid
during the year. There were twenty
five transactions recorded on Market
street, between East and Gough, during
the past year, amounting to $5,559, 5Uu,
at prices varying from $1000 a front
foot to $10,000 a foot, the highest price
ever paid for any* property in this city.
The largest single sale. was that of the
Ede property to James D. Phelan, on
the north side of Market street. Â«Ast
of Stockton, 76:11 on Market by an
average deptu of 100 feet, for 5700,000.
IMIÂ»OnTA3TT. SALES.
"The sale of the Bankers' Investment
Company property on the north side of
Market street, 97:6 west of Kearny, 4S feet
s 5 inches front on Market by average
depth of 100 feet to Geary street in rear,
ior $500,000 was next in importance. This
Is the highest priced property ever sold
in San Francisco, approximating $10,000 a
front foot, or $100 a square foot. The sale
of the gore property, northwest corner
Market and East streets, together with
the northwest corner East and Commer
cial, from the Frank estate to the Cowell
estate, for $500,000 completes the list of
salts of $500,000 and over for the year.
When it is remembered that in 1904 three
sales, $2,600,000. $1,151,000 and $1,000,000, were
recorded. It will be appreciated how gen
eral the activity has been In 1905 with no
sales In excess of the three sales men
tioned above of $700,000, $500,000 and $500,000.
A large increase in each section of the
city has occurred, and this demonstrates
beyond a doubt that the movement in real
estate has been well distributed over all
the sections of the city. The monthly
sales are given herewith:

es compared with the figures of 1304, and
over $8,000,000 over the figures for . 1903.
and Is the greatest increase of any sec
tion in the city. This section witnessed
unusual activity on Mission street and on
portions of Howard street, as well as on
Eart, Second, Third, Fourth. . Fifth and
Â£ixth streets. In the first half of this year,
while in the last half of the year the
purchases by the Southern Pacific Rail
road and tee Western Pacific Railroad
In acquiring lands in this section for de
pot and warehouse purposes, as well as
the purchases by the Ocean Shore Rail
road of a terminal site on Mission street,
between Eleventh and Twelfth, have been
the signal for renewed activity in the
southerly and westerly portions of this
section. This latter corporation is the
only one of its kind which is controlled
entirely by local capital. Its efforts in
giving increased facilities to the traveling
public for reaching the heart of the city
are appreciated, and it Is hoped that the
action of the gentlemen who formed this
corporation will stimulates and encourage
others to develop the other resources of
our city and its adjacent country.
"Important sales were, of course, those
made on the south side of Market street,
in this section, and are as follows: South

WESTERN ADDITION* ACTIVE.
"There were 1661 sales made in the
Western Addition, amounting to $16,349,
844. This shows an increase of $2,751,763
over the figures of 1904, an increase of 20
per cent. The sales in this section have
been well distributed, the usual totals
being due partly to sales In the business
portions of euch streets as Van Ness,
Polk, McAllister and Hayes, as well as
the usual number in ' the residence sec
tion.
"The sales in the Mission district were
2125 in number and amounted to $8,897,-
S3, an increase of over $3,500,000 over 1904
figures, or an increase of over 60 per
cent. Sales were well distributed, and
the monthly totals have been uniformly
large. The important sales besides the
two blocks at Eighteenth, Nineteenth
and Dolores, sold to the city for a park
for $151,350 and $140,000, were: South side
Market, west of Twelfth, $135,000; corner

north of Mission, $75,000, and corner Va
lencia and Fifteenth, $35,000.
"Three thousand one hundred and
eighty-four sales were recorded in
outside lands and homesteads, amount
ing to $5,601,015. an . increase of
$1,849,535 over 1904 figures, or 50
per cent. The event of the year
in this section was the purchase
by a strong syndicate of about fifty
blocks ranging from Nineteenth ave
nue to the ocean and from I street
south, the largest single purchase be
ing twenty-one full blocks and por
tions of thirty-six blocks between
Twenty-fourth and Thirty-seventh
avenues, R and W streets, for $280,000.
The Parkside Syndicate, taking hold
of this property and opening it up,
intends to spend whatever is neces
sary to put the large properties pur
chased by them in first-class shape for
Immediate sale. The advent of a
branch of the Ocean Shore Railroad
into a portion of this section should,
when completed, have a very bene
ficial effect on values there.
"The building operations amounted
to $20,096,758, as against $16,916,118
for 1904. This is an increase of $3,
180,640 over 1904,, or nearly 20 per
cent.
OUTLOOK FOR 1006.
"Notwithstanding the realization of
many of our hopes for the year 1905
and the grand total of $74,392,540 for
the year, as indicated in these col
umns, there is room for the belief that
1906 will far exceed the totals for
1905. Compared with other cities as
to population, bank clearings and
building operations, San Francisco's
figures show no larger a percentage of
increase in the volume of real estate
business and no i larger a volume 6f
actual' business done thaji ''any of the
large Eastern cities. While' in â¢pre
vious years we enjoyed a y moderate
growth, we have only now begun to
show,' not' what our possibilities are
for the future, but by a leap and
bound into an increase of 50 per cent
in one year over figures of $47,000,000.
maintained for three successive years,'
hav<? demonstrated 1 that the -business
done in real estate in 1905 is only on
a par with that of the larger cities of
the country, in -proportion to popula
tion, bank clearings and building op
erations. In other, words. San Fran
cisco has only reached a point in its
growth by rapid strides in the last
four years which it would have
reached had our growth been uni
form during the la^ fifteen years. To
be sure, this growth Is more notice
able, coming, as it has In the last few
years. While during 1904, consider
ing f.he city as a whole, prices had
not advanced materially, they have
done so during 1905.
"Those In touch with the real estate
market have been asked during thÂ«
last year if there was not undue In
flation in the real estate market. - A
fair answer to this ; question would
be. that inÂ» times of prosperity * like
the present, a small degree of specu
lation is bound ,to creep in. A fair
statement would be that 85 to 90 per
cent of our' volume of business is due
to growth and merit, while 10 to 15
per cent might be considered duo to
speculation and a~ discount of our fu
ture." A careful study of the mort
gages in connection with the real es
tate sales , will ahow that I while the
real estate sales amounted to $74.

SEATTLE, Dec, 29.â The New York
Steamship Company probably will build
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
new passenger steamer to be placed on
the run between /San Francisco and Seat
tle some time in 1907. At a meeting of the
board of directors held in New York the
contract will definitely be. let, but there
is little chance that it will go to any
other firm than the New York one. Of
the six bids submitted that of the New
York firm was the lowest and was most
acceptable. Two Pacific Coast firms and
four Atlantic Coast firms submitted bids
en the work. Moran Bros, of this city
and the Union Iron Works of San Fran
cisco were the two Pacific Coast firms.
The New York Shipbuilding Company
offered to deliver the boat cheaper and
quicker than the coast companies. The
cost of the new steamship will run be
tween $750,000 and $800,000. The amount of
the bids Is purposely withheld by Vice
President Ford. The New York firm of
fered to have the vessel completed in
twelve months. The Union Iron Works
wanted eighteen months.

PLACER MINES TO GAIN
MILLIONS IN PLATINUM
Director Walcott Reports on
Sands Rich in Metal.
THIS STATE'S VALUES ARE HIGH
Within two years,- so Charles D. Wal
eott, director . of the United States Geo
logical Survey, has Just reported, the in
vestigation of the black sands of the Pa
cific Coast will lead to an addition of
from $2,000,000 *to $5,000,000 to the output
of the placer gold mines of the West. In
addition to this. Dirctor Waleott predicts
that an adequate supply of "platinum and
the allied metals, osmium- and lridlum,
wiil.be insured, j and valuable industries
will ; be developed in \u25a0 many / points in the
West to* handle the by-products which
have been determined, definitely, to be
in-the sands of the coast. â¢
Those are the first official estimates
that have been made of the value of very
interesting experiments that, have- been
proceeding for some months.'; : They are
embodied in'a report to the .Secretary of
the Interior; in , which an appropriation
of $25,000 to continue the investigation into
the black sands is recommended.
Without such appropriation the experi
mental work- comes to -an abrupt end.
Director Waleott writes that' the plant is
idle, but is kept in readiness, , so that it
may be started in a day after notice has
been received to proceed. \u25a0 The sum of
$25,000 is reported to be sufficient to have
the â¢ experiment continue until next June.
This new addition to the wealth of the
country would be distributed over every
State and Territory west of the Missouri
River and the processes, according to the
director of the Geological Survey, "will
be equally valuable to the placer mines
of the v south and to many undeveloped
placer regions jin Wisconsin, Minnesota
and other Lake States."
EASY OF EXTRACTION.
Up to dafe samples of black sands
from more than 2000 localities have been
examined. Still more than one-third
of * the mining .localities have been
represented in the tests that have beeD
made. It has "been determined that from
95 to 98 per cent of the gold and platinum
in the .'black, sands can be easily ex
tracted, simply by concentration on tables
of certain types. Sands of sea beaches
and' the heavy sands - from sluice boxes
proved to be -in the best . possible condi
tion for separation on tables.
: . /Director Waleott enumerates among the
substances that have been found. in the
sands of this coast, in addition to gold
and platinum, the ..following: Chrome
iron ore,, for the manufacture of paints;
chrome steel and bichromate of potash;
monazite and zircon, for the manufacture
of incandescent gas and electric lights;
magnetic ore,' for the manufacture of
steel; tantallta and columbite, which have
become very valuable in electric lighting,
and corundum, quicksilver, tin ore and
garnet.
Platinum has been found in many local
ities where its presence was not suspect
ed. The majority of tne specimens corr
tained gold In appreciable amount, which
It had- previously been supposed to be
impossible; "to extract, either because the
gold was finely divided or because/ it was
coated with iron oxide or other materials
which prevent amalgamation. The divi
sion was easily accomplished. -
"It was: found in the experiments," so
writes. Director Waleott, "that much
larger supplies of ' high-grade magnetic
iron could , be"; made Valuable easily by
concehtratlon from the sands of the Pa
cific Coast beaches and from waste mag
v.etlc. iron ore : from the sluices of placer
mines. This addition of wealth would be
great, if suitable means for smelting ]
these sands could be found." - â¢'
- The fact has already been published,
but is restated In this connection as a
matter of interest, considering the great
stake that the Pacific Coast has in the
subject, of coast iron and steel, "that,
with the co-operation of the Portland
Chamber of Commerce, an electric
smelter was built from materials obtained
principally on the spot, and steel of good
quality was made directly from the ore,
with as high, an efficiency as eighteen
pounds of steel . per horsepower day, an
efficiency equal to the best electric smelt
ing practice in foreign countries, where
such processes have become established."
VALUES IN CALIFORNIA.
An interesting part of Director Walcott's
report deals with the values of platinum
that were discovered in the course of the
blaqk sand experiments In many locali
ties. The values credited to this State,
per ton of concentrated sands, range from
2 cents to $1934 IS. The statement of values
in California is condensed here as fol
lows: .
Platinum values per ton of concentrated sand
in Chico, $5 40; Magalia, 30 cents; Mokelumne
Hill, 2 cents; Crescent City, 4 cents; Smith
River, 54. cents; South fork of Smith River,
$618 31; Wilson Creek, 2 cents; China Flat,
Humboldt County, $177 08; Orland. $6 87;
Michigan Bluff, 34 cents; Genesee, 6 cents;
Sawyers Â» Bar. $2 80: Oak Bar, 64 cents; Kla
math River, $2 40; Callahan, $7 C 2; Hornbrook.
18 cents; Happy Camp, $50 til; Cecilville,
$ 2 01; Trinity Center. 23 cents; Burnt Ranch,
$13 09; Big Bar," $3 75;" Junction City,
$1934 18; Hawkins Bar, $4 05.
The value per ton in platinum in Oregon
ran very low, according, to the showing
made by Director Waleott, who credits 15
cents a ton to the town of Denmark and
6 cents a ton to Pistol River Beach, In
Curry County. Platinum has been found
frequently at Orovllle in dredging opera
tions. At Stone Lagoon, In Humboldt
County, this State, platinum was found
in commercially -appreciable quantities. !
The Santa Barbara . beach and Sawyers!
Bar, in Sisklyou County, are promising
districts.. At North Fork, Trinity Coun
ty, the supply Is reported to be ; plentiful.
Incidentally .* some information is im
parted by the Director of Geological Sur
vey! that may be of assistance to any one
who intends to search . for platinum. The

SMELTER SITE TROUBLE.
The Redding Searchlight reports that
the site selected for the Balaklala smelt
er has been taken up by San Francisco,
Oakland and other,, parties. Locations
have been made. It is alleged, on top of
those of the Balaklala company. Two
quarter-sections were located. The Search
light publishes the following story:
The lbcaters are A. Soderllne of Bodle, A.'
M. Reynolds and M. A. Hlckox of Redding.
Addlnita Jacobs, Nathan Jacobs, Frank Ja
cobs. C. S. Farquar, Mabel Scott. F. W. Lake.
J. B. Richmond and C. Z. Tracey of San
Francisco, and John D. Ackerman, Portia
Ackerman and Zoe Ackerman of Oakland.
The San Francisco and Oakland contingent
claim that they are not Jumpers, In the sense
in which that word is used. They located
ground that was open to location only since
November 20. the date the land was thrown
open to entry, they maintain. The locations
mada on November 5, - before the land was
thrown open .to . entry, . are , void, according to
their contention. Â« .
But there is another side to the story. It
is held that a mineral claim can be located on
Government land at any time.' a military res
ervation excepted. Thus, a mining; claim can
be staked out within a forest reservation at
any time. The land that was an Indian allot
ment up to November 3 became Government
land on that day because the allotment was
then canceled. The two, quarter sections
could I be located as mineral grounds at once,
and they were so located on November 5 by
the Balaklala interests. The quarter sections
could not be filed upon as homesteads, though,
until November 20, when they were thrown
open to public entry. . >
Two furnaces jat Kennett are reported
to be treating from 500 to 600 tons of ore
a day. An additional furnace will soon
be In operation.
According to. the Folsom Telegraph the
Xatoma vineyard, pf 2CO acres, a few
miles below Folsom, is again under bond
to a company and may be dredged. The
prospecting is proceeding systematically.
Last year a winery on the ranch w^s re
built at a cost of $75,000. The company
having the bond will decide on or before
May 1 whether the property shall be pur
chased for dredging.
Dredge mining will be resumed on the
Bear River. Two machines will be con

GRASS VALLEY, Dec. 23. â Robert
Van Hoeter, a well-to-do prospector,
who had lived in this city for the last
forty years, was murdered in cold blood
at his cabin' near Rough and Ready,
about six miles from here, within the
last few days. He was missed from
his accustomed haunts and a few
friends called at his cabin. They found
the door unlocked, food upon bis table
and his keys in the door. They com
menced to search, but a snowstorm
compelled them to give it up. This
morning Sheriff Walker, City Marshal
Daniel Deeble and twelve others went
to the cabin to institute a search. They
had been out only about five minutes
when William Rule, a friend of the
dead man, shouted to his companions
that he had found the miner's body.
Van Hoeter was lying face upward la
a creek. In the back of his neck was
a large hole, evidently made by a shot
gun, and In the right shoulder was an
other gunshot wound. A short distance
from the body was found a beer check
on a local saloon and a few sliver coin 3.
upon which were bloody finger prints.
The dead man had trouble with hla
neighbors ovar the land he was work
ing, which was reported to be quite
rich. It Is also reported that Van
Hoeter had just made a clean-up from
his sluice boxes and that the murder
was done for the purpose of robbery.
Dennis Donovan, one of Van Hoeter'3
neighbors at Dead Mans Flat, was ar
rested by the Sheriff to-night and 13
being closely questioned concerning hi 3
trouble** with the murdered man. Van
Hoeter owned several pieces of real

Effects of Same Drug.
PORTLAND. Dec. 29.â The body of Kas
par Van Dran, until recently a saloon
keeper In this city, was found to-day In
his room in a downtown hotel. He had
committed suicide by swallowing cyanide
of potassium. "Van Dran left a. note in
which he blamed a former rival saloon
keeper, Joe Young, for his troubles. An
unusual story is attached to the two men
and their families, involving the attempt
of Youns to kill Kaspar Van Dr&n and
the death later of Mrs. Van Dran from
cyanide poisoning, administered by per
sons ' unknown to the authorities. Last
summer Van Dran was shot and seriously
injured by Young for alleged interference
in the domestic life of the Youngs. It
was while Young was out of Jail under
bond for shooting Van Dran that Mrs.
Van Dran was poisoned by drinking gin
ger ale poisoned with cyanide. Mrs. Van
Dran died almost instantly.
A bartender named Chase, who had
been in Young's employ and who later
went to work for Van Dran during his
convalescence from the injuries inflicted
by the bullets from Young's pistol, was
arrested In San Francisco on suspicion or
having killed Mrs. Van Dran and was re
turned . here 'for examination, but was
never put on the stand. There was not
sufficient evidence to hold him. Later
Young was tried for shooting Van Dran.
convicted and sentenced to ten years' im
prlsonnient in the penitentiary.

.Victim Manages to Crawl to
Hallway, After Reviving;
in Time to Save Himself
From Being Asphyxiated
Frederick Bruns, 60 years of age and a
eight clerk In a lodging-house at 835
Kearny street, was brutally beaten,
gagged and robbed by two men at 10
o'clock last night. The robbers lured
Bruns to a room which they expressed a
â desire to" occupy, then wielded a bludgeon
and when the old man lay unconscious
Ptook from his pockets all he possessed
end made their escape. The gas jets in
the room were turned fully on. When
Bruns returned to consciousness he de
tected the odor, and managed to release
a gag from his mouth and call for help.
Had be remained uiÂ»conscious a few mo
ments longer he would have been asphyx
iated. The crime was committed within
& block from the Hall of Justice.
According to the story Bruns told Officer
James Ward, who was first to arrive on
the scene, two young men entered the
office of the lodging-house and applied
for lodgings. They requested that they
be shown to their room, and Bruns led
tbe way to an Inner room on the third
floor. When the three were in the apart
ment Bruns turned on the gas and was
In tlie act of lighting it when he was
Struck from behind with a blunt instru
ment. The force of the blow rendered
rTim unconscious and he fell to the floor.
the robbers searched his
~ pockets and took S3 In coin. They then
* "eerured towels and bound their victim
JLind and foot. That there might be no pos
*â¢bility of an outcry the thugs took the
â¢"'precaution to tie a towel around Bruns'
tfead and over his mouth.
About an hour after the assault Bruns
recovered consciousness. He realized his
c *ppsltion, and after a .severe struggle suc
ceeded In uncovering his mouth. Gradu
a3l>' he worked his way to the door, and,
.. xrtth his limbs still bound, managed to
get into the hallway. There he shouted
, for*helrÂ». Richard Kennon, a lodger, re
spnnded, and soon Bruns was able to tell
his stcry.
\u25a0 Patrolman Ward made an immediate
investigation, and Detectives Matheson
and Mulcahy were detailed on the case.
Up until a late hour this morning no
;'i clue as to the perpetrators had been
gained. Bruns was in such an excited
condition that he was unable to give any
â definite description of the men he es
* corted to the room.
A few \u25a0weeks ago a Elmilar crime was
perpetrated on a night clerk in a Third
8 street hoteL The method of luring the
Â« qlerk. to a room by asking for lodging
and* having him conduct the criminals to
it is a new one in San Francisco, and
the ease with which it can be worked
successfully is giving the police grave
concern.

TWO EFFICIENT AND POPULAR MEMBERS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
WHO WERE PROMOTED AT LAST NIGHT'S SESSION OF THE BOARD OF
POLICE COMMISSIONERS.
FIRE DESTROYS
GASOLINE BOAT
Engineer Attempts to Fill
Tank With Aid of Lantern
and an Explosion Follows
The i" gasoline towboat Gee Whiz, be
longing to the Rideout Brothers'
Steamboat Company, was almost com
pletely destroyed by fire about 7
o'clock last evening, while tied near
the end of the Harrison-street wharf.
The fire was caused by the explosion
of about fifty gallons of gasoline ig
nited by a lantern which was used by
Engineer E. li. Slater while filling the
tank. Slater was blown overboard,
but miraculously escaped Injury.
Shortly after dark Slater decided to
fill the tank, which already contained
about fifty gallons of. oil, and. setting
his lantern within a few feet of the
tank, proceeded to take off the cap.
As soon as the cap was removed the
gas collected about the lantern and
the explosion followed. Slater saw his
danger and attempted to jump, but be
fore he could do so he was thrown
far out into the water by the force of
the explosion.
' Captain J. E. Dethlefson, who was
standing on, the wharf, saw the dan
ger of the engineer and, threw him a
rope, by which he was pulled on the
wharf. An alarm of fire was then
turned In. and several companies re
sponded lino" In the course of a few
minutes they had filled the boat with
water, which caused it to sink. /The
exact damage to the boat cannot be
determined until it has been raised,
but it Is thought by the' owners to
be in the neighborhood of $1000. :
The engine of the Gee Whiz has
been considered a hoodoo for some
time. It' was . first taken from a
wrecked launch near Honolulu and
while in the course of- repairs by the
Hercules Gas Engine Company the
building burned and the. engine was
taken from the debris. The en
gine has been undergoing repairs most
of the time since and : was taken from
the shop only a week ago. The man
ager stated last night ,that he had had
enough of gasoline boats and would
rid himself of this one as soon as : pos
sible."
The Gee -Whiz is fifty feet long,
with a twelve-foot beam and was used
for towing, barges about the bay. She
was driven" by a' 9o-horsepower engine.

MAYOUR JAILED
FOR GRAFTING
Executive- of Long Beach
and a Councilman Are Ac
cused of s Taking Bribes
PLACED BEHIND BAKS
Town Is Shocked by Disclos
ures Made by Arrest of
Two of Its Trusted Officers
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29. â Rufus A.
Eno," Mayor of Long Beach, and J. B.
Lbsee, one of its prominent Councllmen,
were; arrested this afternoon by the
District Attorney of the county and
locked in the County Jail on a charge
of taking bribes. The two specific in
stances relate to \u25a0 "rake-offs" in the
building of the Long Beach wharf, but
It is, claimed that the grafting extends
over a period of two years, or since tho
two men -took office. Nearly all of the
big contracts that went through the
Mayor's offlc* are said to, have been
"greased -through" with bribe money.
Their arrest was a complete surprise to
the -two, officials, also to Long Beach,
which was simply thunderstruck. That
town has. always been a' stronghold of
church people, and the. city, officers
were thought, to be above suspicion. .
Two secret service men went to Long
Beach frorri*" Los Angeles this afternoon
from the office of the District Attorney.
One of; them found Eno on the street
and asked him to come to the city for
a "conference" with District Attorney
Fredericks. Losee was found, in - his
real estate office. He was also invited
to ihe;city._for a "conference." Neither
of the two men had the slightest idea
that - they, were being arrested. They
came out of the "conference" under ar
rest on* a- felony charge. They are
charged on two particular counts.
pj J. C. Newsom, an architect, to get the
plans for the dancing pavilion at the
end "of the Long Beach wharf accepted,'
is alleged to have paid $300 to Eno for
himself , and. Losee. The money is al
leged-to have been paid in the City
Hall at the time Eno helped Newsom
cash his jj demand. The other was In
regard to the specifications for piling
for the wharf. Losee is alleged to have
put through a resolution changing the
piling from .cylindrical to square. Th 6
change lessened the cost of the con
tract Sl5OO.
Losee is said to have pocketed $1009
for himself and Eno, the city being
made to -pay the- contract off thts
original price. Losee and Eno had a
long talk with the District Attorney.
He would not say whether they con
fessed or not.
Afterward they made a statement
claiming that their arrest Is due to a
political conspiracy, their enemies tak
ing this means of "doing them up."
They both. were cool and collected. Af
ter some hours in jail they were re
leased on bail furnished. by prominent
Long Beach. men.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS
GREATLY DISPLEASED
Say Americans Not Worthy
of Honor Have Been Pre

ROME, Dec 29.â The Vatican authori

several American Bishops against the au
diences granted by the Pope to Ameri
cans who, in the opinion of these Bishops,
were not worthy of the honor, which, it
is added, created dissatisfaction among
the faithful.
The Pope has also been informed that
among the persons presented to him. a
few days ago was an American woman
who had been divorced. This irritated the
Pontiff, who declared that such a pres
entation must not occur again.
The officials of the Vatican are also
recalling that two Americans recently
refused to kneel when the Pope appeared
and the persons having authority in thesÂ»
matters have been ordered to bo more
strict in arriving at decisions upon appli
cations from Americans for audiences of
the Pope. American applicants in the
future must be recommended by their
respective Bishops or have their applica
tions supported by a recognized official

SECRET SERVICE MEN
HUNTING FOR BAKER
Search for Him. Has Been
Taken Up in Great
Earnest.
OAKLAND, Dec. 23.â For the first time
Eince the arrest of M. Louisa Bowen for
stealing more than. s7ooo from sub-station
No. 1 of the local postofflce, of which
she was in charge, and the disappearance
of Louis W. Baker, <o whom she claims
to have given the money, the postal in
spectors have begun a systematic search
for Baker.
Heretofore it has been a question of
doubt whether Baker could be Implicated
in the crime, since it -was supposed that
he simply borrowed the coin that Miss
Bowen purloined. But to-day the postal
Inspectors and the secret service agents
Interviewed Mlm Bowen and immediately
began a eystematic searcQ for the miss
ing man. It is said they received infor
mation that will be sufficient to convict
Baker of being an accomplice of the
young woman.
Mrs. Matilda Brown, who took charge
of the BUb-etatlon in order to give Miss
Bowen employment, said to-night that
If the postal authorities decide that she is
liable she will make good the shortage in
the office.
Since Baker's disapearance and the at
tachment was placed on his Ninth-street
printing office by Mrs. Brown, many per
sons have called with contracts on the
firm. Mrs. Henrietta Donaldson claims
to hold a chattel mortgage on the office
furniture for $1250, and there are many
other claims, it is alleged, to be adjusted.
'.XtJvas rumored to-day that Baker had
been seen at Tenth and Franklin streets,
Oakland, at 6 o'clock last evening by Dep
uty Constable Jones, but the police, after
talking to Jones, discredit the story. There
was another 6tory that Attorney Carey
Howard was trying to raise bonds that
Baker might give himself up and be re
leased. Attorney Howard, however, de
nies absolutely that hi has taken any
steps in the matter.

JOHN SWETT SPEAKS
OF FARM STUDY.
Declares That a Compulsory Agricultural
Course Is Not Advisable. '
OUGHT TO BROADEN NATURE WORK
BERKELEY, Dec. 29.â Farmers and
teachers met together in Joint session to
day for the last time during the gathering
of educators and grangers at Berkeley.
As before the topic of greatest interest
to both sections was the moot question
of introducing agriculture as a subject
for instruction in the public schools.
John Swett, the veteran California ed
ucator, who rounded out nearly a half
century of active work as a school man
a few years ago, discussed this morning
the ways in which school children may
be induced to take an interest in farm
life.
In the introductory paragraphs of his
paper on "Common-sense Ways of Inter
esting Public School Children in Nature
Studies," Mr. Swett referred to himself
humorously as one who, when he at
tended farmers' institutes, "passed him
self off as a school teacher trying to
learn something about fruit growing,"
and at teachers' associations posed as a
"granger who wants to learn something
about school-teaching." He spoke in part
as follows:
A farmer recently said to me that boys and
girls were being "educated away from the
farm." This complaint is occasionally made
at Grange meetings. If It is well founded the
condition complained of should be remedied.
The ways and means are what we have to
consider. First, we .may be reminded that of
old, in Noah Webster's time, agriculture was
studied, as set forth In a "Little Reader's
Assistant" of his, printed In 1791> a copy ot
which I have given to Professor Brown of the
Ktate University that contains a farmer's cat
echism of eight pages, in which the work of
the agrlculturlist is magnified, and boys and
girls axe taught to believe In the dignity and
importance of the. farmer's work. So far as
agricultural textbooks are concerned that
\u25a0\u25a0catechism" was the only thing of Its kind
used for a century.
COMPULSORY WORK WONT DO.
Let us consider for a moflient what Is prac
ticable in the rural schools of our own State.
Compulsory teaching of agriculture In the ele
mentary schools won't do. It has been tried
with entomology and failed dismally. I think
the common sense way will be to make use
of the existing school laws and courses of
Etudy. Under the general head of nature
study suggestions are made to teachers con
cerning oral lessons on plant and animal life..
Children bring Into school common wild flowers
and make a simple and untechnical 'study ol
them. They learn something about the forest
trees. They bring In samples of .fruit from the
farms on which they live. They study fruit
trees and grape vines. In the tadpole season
they bring in polllwogs, put them In glass Jars
and watch th?lr transformation Into frogs.
They collect specimens of rocks and minerals
for the school cabinet.
When they are 8 cr 9 years old the pupils
begin to use the new State elementary geog
raphy, recently adopted, which Is in Itself a
mod*?l textbook on nature study, full of refer
ences to farm and home life. In the rural
school libraries la offered an opportunity of
placing: books for children's use relating to
farm life. There are many of these books
available, somÂ© by Professor E. J. Wlckson
and others by Eastern men
A sma'.l garden plat is a desirable attach
ment to a rural echool, when it is possible to
obtain water for irrigation in the dry season.
In this matter of Interesting children in
rural life, however, the schools cannot do it
all. I wculd ask the farmers whether they
have shown* the proper interest In the country
schools â visited them. got In touch with the
teachers, encouraged their work on : these
lines? I know of coma young ladies who have
resigned their schools because of a farmer's
criticisms of the attempt at nature study. The
farmers must co-ooerate. They should take
their boys to Farmers' Institutes and at home
encourage them by giving them a colt to raise
and sell, or giving the girls a part of the poul
try yard proceeds. This will be part of the
work of keeping the young folk in the country
Interested in rural life.
ENCOURAGE OBSERVATION.
Women teachers who say they cannot be
expected to teach agriculture, milking cows,
making cheese and bread are right. Those
things will be taught at home. Teachers,
however, can start their pupils on the way to
find out a great many things from their own
observation and from books about nature and
the farm.
How to gain the time to do this extra work?
Cut down by one-half the time now given to
arithmetic la the higher grades. Many of ths
wisest teachers In California are trying to do
this now. President Eliot of Harvard has
led a -movement to do it In the East.
Finally, It seems to me that the wise plan
for us to pursue at present is to .leave thÂ« mat
ter of agriculture In the common schools to
county boards of education, county superin
tendents, county Institutes, high school trus
tees and to the women who do most of the
teaching. It has taken twenty years to make
a fair beginning of manual training In the ur
ban schools and quite as long to prove the
value of drawing In, elementary schools. Vocal
music Is 6tll! considered a fad. The kinder
garten Is still antagonized by many , teachers
for city children under 6 years of age. The
normal schools were antagonized for twenty
five years by the old line school teachers, by
private schools and by most colleges and uni
versities. Let us possess our souls In patience
when we consider the relation of the schools
to elementary Instruction In agriculture, horti
culture and truck farming and wait for new
Ideas to take root.
One of the most entertaining papers
read during the entire session of the in
stitute was that of Professor E. J. Wick
son, entitled "The Industrial Use of the
Imagination." Wit and wisdom were
combined in attractive measure In . the
professor's remarks, and not a. dull mo
ment was endured by Professor Wickson's
auditors while the paper waa being read.
It was in part as follows:
WICKSON OX IMAGINATION.
TTiose of my hearers who are old enough to
be wise will recognise my subject "as a graft.
Thirty-flve years ago John Tyndall had the task
of preparing a discourse for the British Asso
ciation, and, to escape distraction!, made a
Journey to the Swiss Alps, talcing with him, as
he says, "two volumes of poetry," Goethe's
"Farbenlehr" and Bain's "Logic." One of his
critics afterward said he failed to see the wit
in calling those books two volumes of poetry.
To him Mr. Tyndall elmply replied:- "Nor do
I." For Tyndall wae deeper than his critic
thought; he was not Indulging in pleasantry,
he had a deeper purpose, and he even went so
far as to select his books for dramatic effect.
He wished to forcibly suggest that creative
work in poetry and In reasoning called Into ac
tion the same power of the mind, and he could
then proceed to show that creative work in nat
ural science proceeded from the same source.
He chose as his subject "The .Scientific Use ot
the Imagination." The Idea was not new, but
the limes seemed to demand Its enforcement,
and Tyndall proceeded to meet this requirement
by recourse to the true scientific method, via:
to illustrate by a tew simple Instances the v.to
that scientific men have already made. of this
power of the Imagination and to indicate after
ward some of the further uses they are likely
to make of It. And this he succeeds in â¢Icing
in a way more effective wlUi the peoplu to
whom he desired to appeal than any philo
sophic argument could have been.
It was particularly neceesary Just at that
time that this should be done. The wave of
popular* Interest in the achievements of natural
science was running high. Books and maga
zines- were laden with discoveries, and lecture
platform's were ablaze' with demonstrations in
chemistry and physics. The people were get
ting- the idea t hat all \u25a0 that they : needed ! to do
was to equip themselves sufficiently with In
struments of glass and brass to lay bare all the
secrets of the universe â they , were j even r - prone
to think that they could "find out God" by this
line of searching. It was. time to show. them,
thought Tyndall, that euch hopes were vain.
FARM IMPROVE3iEHfTS. ~~
I have invoked this powerful work of ,Tyn
dall which accomplished bo 'much a third of a
century ago toward a better understanding of
the relation of ecientiflc research to other' great
Undertakings of i mankind, because* it- seems' "to
nje our present strong impulses toward .indus
trial achievements_ may lead some - tpj^think
that here at least we - have something quite
different Intellectually from , other \u25a0; human ef
forts and that proper preparation for it;con
sists in becuring on entirely, new outfit of meth
ods, agencies and principles.
Z:'Eb.all.conlJne my effort to a few suggestions
on the ---"agricultural use \u25a0: of Jhe , Imagination"
and \u25a0 endeavor to render them somewhat : con
crete by discussing the - significance . of forma
in animals and plants. - Let us consider briefly
a few. of the more - obvious 'manifestation * of
fcrm6 In agricultural : practices and , products
and ask what they teach us of .themselves and
what, they teach us of : ourselves, . . â¢:, *.Â»â¢,\u25a0
W tat \u25a0do we mean Iby "form" in â¢ this dis
cussion? An agricultural form Is an Improved
THE SAN FRANCISCO i; CALL, \ -DECEMBER : 30, 1905.
form. The very word agriculture Implies that;
not improved form In a moral sense; not *Â»in
Kood firm" as approved by a society leader;
not "in a pood rorm" as depleted- In the ad
vertisements of popular tonics â but Improved
form in an agricultural sense. - But an im
proved form of what? â¢ Manifestly of every
thing on the farm except the farmer, and his
bank account; these . improvements belong to
preacher and the economist. ' Let me buk
eeatva few striking: Instances of lmDrovement.'
First, improved implements. Contrast Â£he
modern riding gangplow L and the forked stick
of ancient aericulture and surviving still In
benighted regions. Or compare the California
traction engines, pulling plows enough to turn
a 40-foot width of land with the single furrow
plow which lacked rational adaptation .to its
work, even as late aÂ« Jefferson's time. Or
11J"1 1 J" of the flall which perhaps some of my
older hearers remember swinging, '.with' the
California combined harvester, steam propelled
and riding the plains of the San"J6aauin, au-'
toroobtlo, as a battleship, which its fuming
chimneys I and castellated structure cause It
to resemble.
CATTLE DEVELOPMENT."
Second, improved animals. Compare the
lordly shorthorn and other . cattle bred for
teef, every useful part expanded to fullness,
and â¢ every useless part repressed, with the
j swayback, cat-hammed, long-legged "bos
Urus ' which Julius Caesar hunted in Gaul,
j Compare also the deep capacious dairy breeds
with the- wretched -unprintable scrubs which
still - remain ~to emphasize the. quality of their
betters. Remember . also the . thoroughbred
racer and the draughthorse; the greyhound and
the mastiff; the game fowi and the light
Brahma â grand instances of agricultural torm
as adapted to various , powers and uses. ;â¢ : .
Third, improved plants. Study the uniform
ity of California orchard trees, capable, of a
maximum of product with least cost of uro
ductlon. Learn the economic importance ' of
the spherical peach,, the seedless orange, the
special types ot grapes for various uses. Cora-,
pare the grand, many times double rose with
the cra m but graceful eglantine. Remember
the flavors, odors a^id colors developed in t,he
Improved fruits, the food value of grains, the
durable beauty of flowers.
If we should review the achievements of
progressive agriculture in all lines It would
bÂ« easy to demonstrate the service rendered
by the creative faculty in industrial affairs. . j
It would be clear that to reach any success
in â¢ industrial effort there must he an ideal. In
no line has this been more clearly, demon
strated than in the development of the domestic
animal, as has already been suggested. But
even in smallest affairs the same rule holds â
no man can prune a tree intelligently .without
an ideal of a tree of that.-variety in his mind.
Nor can he turn a furrow nor can he bltcb
up a team without such' a conception. Men
who cannot conceive an Ideal of what each
act should be are our stupid men. They are
men who never can do anything.
â\ .MUST LOOK AHEAD.
Now what Is /the conclusion ot the whole
matter? Education Is the only agency by
which the true can be enforced and the false
cast outâ not shallow, inadequate, incomplete
education which misleads, because the pos
sessor thinks he has gold, but it is only silver.
Teach handicraft, teach Imitative arts, but
do not think that those are the end;: they are
but means to. an end of which they are un
conscious. Humanity must see beyond the ends
of its fingers, and the guaranty in that as one
does go farther and forms concentlons . of the
principles and understanding of the - mate
rials Involved, handicraft is Improved and its
reward multiplied.
In the present demand for a change In ped
agogic subjects, so as to better serve the time
and the people in industrial advancement and
to arouse tastes^and sentiments in sympathy
with rural employment, care should be taken
not to subEtitute information for education.
It Is teaching for the good old -purposes of
mental awakening and strengthening which,
must not be lost slcht of. The new oedaeoslc
material will be better than the old in its
intrinsic usefulness and \u25a0 suggestlveness, but
the art and science of employing It in school
work will be the same., in motive and purpppes,
that havo ruled since good teaching beean.

UNIQUE HONOR
Peruvian Government Offers
Dr. Max Uhle Place as Di
rector of Research Work
RESIGNS AT UNIVERSITY
Regents to Receive His Re
quest That Contract With
the State Be Terminated
BERKELEY, Dec. 29.â Signal honor has
been Dr. Max Uhle of the an
thropological department of -the Univer
sity of California by the Oovernment of
Peru,. which has invited him to take the
position of director of anthropological sur
veys for that state.' . r
Dr. Uhle is under contract to the uni
versity, to~serve for \ five years, three of
which have almost expired. He has writ
ten to the Regents asking that he be per
mitted to terminate this contract at. this
time, and _the resignation which accom
panies the request is to be presented to
the Regenta at their next meeting.:
A. story that Dr. Uhle has resigned. as
the result "of differences with Dr. j Fred
erick Putnam, head of the anthropological
department of the university, _is denied"
by the authorities. Dr. Uhle's new post
| under the Peruvian Government is es-
I teemed as -an important and honorable
place, promotion to which would be cov
eted by any archaeologist.
The archaeological explorations of the
University of California In South America
have? been in charge of Dr. Uhle, who
spent Â« tho years from 1599 to 1001, and
again. from the end of. 1903 to the present
time, in expeditions to Peru. In tb,e in
terval Dr. Uhle was occupied in classify
ing and cataloguing his collection and pre
paring his report, as. well as participat
ing in the archaeological exploration of
the California shell mounds. Hisflrst In
vestigations in Peru were made in the
vicinity of Trujillo, especially at the ruins
of Moche, where he obtained a large col
lection of the finely painted pottery char
acteristic of this region and of other spec
imens. * Subsequent explorations were
made at Huamachuco, also in Northern
Peru, and at several localities in South
ern Peru, mainly in the valleys of Chln
cha, of lea and at Huaitar, In the valley
of Pisco.
In most of these excavations, as in those
of Northern Peru, several distinct types
of culture were established by the relative
position and character of the structures
and finds. These investigations have
made very probable a successionof from
four to six distinct periods in the various
localities. They are therefore important
in tracing for the first time a definite
historical sequence in what has hitherto
been the chronological chaos of ancient
Peruvian civilization.
On his second expedition Dr. Uhle vis
ited several localities on the coast of
Southern; Peru. Excavations were con
ducted at Ancon for the purpose of deter
mining the historical development of this
ancient settlement. A large collection of
pottery, textiles and other antiquities
were obtained. The aiscovery of a new
prehistoric site near the main necropolis
resulted in the collection of specimens'ot
an entirely new type and apparently of
great age. - â¢".â¢ <
On the southwest. slope of th\ Cerro de
Trinidad the remains of another type of
ancient civilization, hitherto unobserved,
were discovered. On the completion of
the explorations at Chancay investiga
tions were carried on northward along
the coast, in the valleys of Huacho and
of Supe; Various sites in these places
were visited, and the ruins of an exten
sive ancient town near San Nicolas were
made the subject of an extended explora
tion. > Dr.-: Uhle's latest explorations have
been in the region of Cuzco. %

had planned a general jail delivery and
the murder of Sheriff Veale and the jailer.
Kelleher was approached by Renton and
Zimmerman while a prisoner in Martinez

was revealed to hiy. ',He was told that
"it was up to him" to get some saws into
the jail as soon as he was released. Kel
leher told the Sheriff to-day that he
feared Renton and his desperate'accom
plice and was afraid to refuse to do as
they wished, -so he promised to smuggle
the required tools Into the Jail as soon as
he was freed.

MORE FRUITS
FOR THE STATE
Dates, Pineapples and Hardy
Oranges Developed by the
Government Plant Bureau
"WASHINGTON". Dec. 29.â The activ
ity of the Bureau of Plant Industry of
the Department of Agriculture In its
efforts to improve agricultural condi
tions throughout the United States is
set forth in the annual report of the
director of the bureau, B. T. Galloway.
Co-operative work with the agri
cultural experiment stations of the
several States and Territories has been
extended. School garden work has
been assisted in many ways and 175,000
packets of seeds have been supplied to
schools. The work on cotton 'has in
cluded the conducting of experiments
to secure early and weavll -resisting
types. Single-germ beet sugar seed
will sjum be produced in quantities suf
ficient for field demonstrations. New
varieties of hardy oranges, new pine
apples and new races of corn and cot*
ton have been "developed In the labora
tory of plant breeding. Valuable strains
of tobacco have been obtained by hy
bridization. It has been shown that
heavy seed produces better plants thau
light seed. ~* l
The growing of winter wheat has
-been extended In the southern portions
of North Dakota and Minnesota, and
new cereals adopted to the Southern
States have been developed.
A new date garden has been established
at Yuma, A. T.. especially for the culti
vation of varieties from the Persian
Gulf. The planting of grasses as sand
binders has produced important results.
At the seed laboratory 9364 germination
tests and 1415 tests for mechanical purity
have been made. Of 1220 samples of seeds
obtained in the open market. 230 were
found to be either adulterated or mis
branded.
The foreign .explorations have resulted
In the securing of many valuable varie
ties of \u25a0 dates for the Government date
gardens in Arizona and California and
also many important dry land fodder
plants.
The results achieved in combating dis
eases of orchard fruits have been espe
cially gratifying. Remedies for the dis
ease of orange trees known as "die
back" have been discovered, and the pro
portion affected in a region, where ten
years ago 50 per cent of the trees were
diseased has been reduced to less than
one-tenth of 1 per cent. Disease-resistant
grapes are being developed .and propa
gated.
In the Congressional seed distribution
nearly 36,000.000 packets and packages of
seeds and more . than 230,000 grape vines,
strawberry plants and bulbs have, been
sent out.

ROUGH PASSAGE
OF TROPIC BIRD
Barkentine, Fourteen Dajs
% From the Columbia Biver,
Seeks Shelter at San Pedro
LOSES PART OF LOAD
For Seventy-Two Hours the
Vessel Is at Mercy of High
Wind and Heavy Seas
SAX PEDRO, Dec. 29.â With 100.000 feet
of her deckload of lumber gone and badly
battered and torn from a strenuous thres
days* conflict with a terrific storm. the
barkentine Tropic Bird, Captain Wlck
man. out fourteen days from the ColuiVT
bla River, crept behind the shelter of isl
outer breakwater late to-night.
The Tropic Bird left the northern port
on December 11. and for three days her
voyage was fine and uneventful. Oa De
cember 17 she ran into a severe south
by southwest gale, the storm breaking
upon the vessel with sudden fury, stand
ing the barkentine on her beam ends and
setting the decks awash. For three days
the crew and captain battled to save the
shtp, and to add to their worry and hard
ship, for sixty hours the cooks' galley
was flooded, forcing them to fight tho
fury of the storm without food.
On December W the storm was fiercest,
the winds and waves severely battering
the windjammer, forcing the sailors to
take refuge in the captain's cabin. Finally
the huge chains which secured her deck
load were swept into the sea. With the
loss of the deckload and the abatement of
the wind, the, vessel righted herself. Tho r
lumber lost is valued at about $2000.

CAPTAIN WEBER
GETS LAID OFF
Blamed by Local Inspectors
for Death of the Boy
James Mitchell by Burns
MASTER IS NEGLIGENT
Failure 'to Report Leaky
Oil Tanks to Authorities
Punished With Suspension
The United States local inspectors of
steam vessels, O. F. Bolles and. John K.
Bulger, yesterday handed down a deci
sion suspending for ninety days the li
cense of Henry, Weber, master, and
James H. Spencer, chief engineer of the
steamer- Despatch. The decision is) as
follows :
After a j.' careful- consideration of the evi
dence taken in this case we find that the
tire which took place on the steamer Despatch
about 4:50 o'clock p. m.. on December 8 . last,
while the vessel was "lying near the Sixteenth
street drydock, causing "the death of James
Mitchell, a boy, .by asphyxiation, originated
from . gases generated by fuel oil on board
that; vessel. Whether the gases were -gen
erated f ro:n the. oil which came from the. leak
ing tanks .on board or from the oil heater,
the pressure gauge of which was knocked off,
we a.re unable to determine, owing to the.
conflicting evidence given in the case. -There
can bo no doubt, however, â¢ from the evidence,
that the cause of the tire originated from the
gases, generated on board the vessel and
which came' in contact with open lights that
were being used by the carpenters, machinists
and ; sealers on that day, In lieu of electric
or Davy lamps, which should have been-; used
for safety and no doubt -would have averted
the accident.
W e also find from the evidence that Henry
Weber and James M.- Spencer, " master and
chief engineer respectively of the steamer DÂ«s r
patch, depended on the superintending engineer
and the managing owner, to whom they re
ported, and who had charge of all \u25a0 work
ashore to notify this office of the leaking con
dition of the tanks on the vessel. Such a
course does not excuse the . master and chief
engineer, for the reason that they themselves
are accountable under the rules and regula
tions governing this service, and we look to
them alone, as licensed officers of steam ves
sels to report to the United States local In
spectors at any and all times when there Is
any accident or occurrence producing serious
injury to the vessel, her boilers or machinery.
Therefore for such neglect and failure to
report to this office the leaking condition of
the tanks on board the steamer Despatch, In
violation . of . section 4448, United States Re
vised Statutes we .hereby this date, under
authority of section 4450, 'United States Re
vised Statutes suspend the license of Henry
Weber, master,' and the license of James M.
Spencer! chief engineer, each for the period
of ninety days.
GUESTS MAKE MERRY
WHILE MAN IS KILLED
Party at* Country Home and
Fatal Explosion in the
. Greenhouse.
GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 29. â In
ignorance that an explosion which had
shaken the house was more than a
trivial affair, the guests of Charles H..
Mallory at Byrara shore last night
continued their merriment. It was
several hours later that they learned
that In the explosion James Mackey,
Mallory's head gardener, lost his life,
and that several thousand dollars'
worth "of damage had been done. .
. Mallory, who *ls*-. the'.. head.-.. of.V--the
steamship line of that .name, j had . a
score' of , friends â¢ from ' New York and
Brooklyn for , a. house party and they
had just begun* to play cards when a
gas,, tank, in a' greenhouse Ej 350 feet
from the residence . blew up. The de
tonation was heard for five' miles. It
shattered every pane of glass in the
greenhouses on the estate and the
windows on one side of the home. . It
blew a servant off his feet and brought
the guests from their seats.
Mackey's body was later found 100
feet "from the explosion by his wife,
who had, gone in search for him. The
guests, though startled, did not real
ize the extent of the accident until the
party broke up.

BREAKS RECORD

the Industrial Circles
LABOR. WELL EMPLOYED
Railroad Earnings and Steel
Give Full Evidence of the
of Prosperity
NEW YORK. Dec. 29.â DUn's weekly
review of trade to-morrow will say:
Unseasonably mild weather accentuated
the customary holiday dullness In the
distribution of merchandise, but grat
ifying results of Christmas trade es
tablished a strong tone, and confidence
regarding the future is more pro
nounced. Outdoor work is facilitated
by the high temperature and the lack
of snow, making the year's total of
building. operations even greater than
the most sanguine expectations. Trada
In furs and heavy clothing is unfavor
ably affected by the open winter, but
the net result is moat satisfactory. It
Is ; gratifying to manufacturers to find
that no burdensome accumulation of
stocks has occurred, despite recent
record-breaking production.
Statements of railway, earnings con
tinue satisfactory, figures thus far
available for December showing an av
erage gain of 6.9 per : cent over 1904.
Foreign commerce at this port was re
markably favorable, exports gaining
$2,003,129 and imports increasing
$4,161,897 as compared \u25a0 with the same
week last year.
Light trading in hides has not weak
ened quotations. ' Foreign dry hides
have the additional support of advices
from the River Platte that the slaugh
ter will Indicate a considerable de
crease, i *\u25a0"-;/
Failures this week numbered 221 In
the United States," against 221 last year,
and, 27 in Canada, compared with 17
last year.
' Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:": In
wholesale trade, clearing sales . and
stock-taking operations absorb atten
tion, but It is noted that operations for
spring account are larger than-or
dinarily, and. in fact, business ia
heavier \u25a0 than expected at, this season.
Staples generally maintain their old
strength. Iron and steel lead the "in
dustries In strength of demand and
prices, finished steel: being particularly
active for 'this season, . though pig
iron sales are fair at the West and
open weather favors \unpreccdented
production.- Labor is exceptionally well
employed . for this , season. January Is
likely to see few strikes in the print-
Ing trades.
Additional reports. as to trade In the
year now closing point to 1905 as hav
ing been a record breaker alike in ag
ricultural, speculative, financial and
industrial circles. As a whole, how
ever 1 , primacy must be assigned to the
manufacturing: industry, which- shows
the . largest gains over all preceding
years. .
Business failures in the United States

FIRM SENT TO WALL
BY .RISE IN COPPER
H. R. Leighton & Co. of
Boston Make an As
signment.
BOSTON", Dec. 29.â The recent ri3e
in copper stocks on the Boston Board
of Trade was an important contribut
ing cause to the suspension to-day of
the stock brokerage firm of H. R.
Leighton & ,Co., which assigned for the
benefit of its creditors. Although the
firm is not a member of any stock
exchange, the 'assignment was ad-
Judged of considerable Importance
from the fact that the firm has some
forty branch offices, all but three of
them in Xew England. The assignee
Is Charles E. Allen, a lawyer of this
city. . . - -
The firm stated that the suspension
was due to the failure of a member
of the Boston Stock Exchange to meet
his obligation to the company and to
outstanding Investments. No financial
statement wasHssued, but It is thought
the liabilities may reach $500,000.
Almost all the larger cities of New
England are affected by the suspen
sion. There are several hundred cred
itors throughout New England and
Canada. The failure had no effect
upon the stock market.

PUBLICATION- OFFICE... .THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
SATURDAY DECEMBER 30, 1905
REPORT ON I&ERCHANT MARINE.
AREMARKABLY-strong showing in favor of Government aid
to American shipping is made in the recent report by Mr.
Gallinger from the joint commission on the merchant marine.
This commission, which was authorized by the act of April 28, 1904,
concluded its most important labors last December, but the chair
man held a conference last spring in New York to hear the argu
ments of shipping interests which had not been considered by the
commission. The later inquiry has developed no change in the leg
islation originally proposed. So that for nearly a year the bill sub-,
mitted by the commission in its first report has been before the
country for examination. â¢
The bill has received the approval of some very important rep
resentative bodies and its chief support has not come from ship
owners and builders, nor from the States bordering on the ocean,
but from merchants and manufacturers concerned in export trade,
and from the producers of the interior. The measure is approved
by the National Board of Trade, the American Bankers' Association,
the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Cotton
Manufacturers' Association.
One of Gallinger's arguments is that a large part qf the $200.
000.000 which js annually expended, to transport our mail, freight
and passengers now goes to help the naval reserve of foreign na
tions. The bill in its proposed subvention does not intend that a
subsidy shall be an outright gift. The ship owners will have to
render a return service which will aid toward the creation of a naval
reserve and help the expansion of commerce. That our trade to
British Australasia has more than doubled is due to our mail steam
ship service, which is not adequately paid. The increase provided for
in the bill will no more than bring the compensation of the American
line up to what the European .steamship companies receive. The bill
will produce a revenue as well as the expenditure and the report
estimates that there will be a net gain to the treasury as a result. Two
sections arrange for a tax on tonnage, and it is expected that the
stimulus to American ships would cause a great increase in tonnage.
The amount now paid by the Government for mail service is very
nearly balanced by the net profit obtained by the United States from
its ocean mail service. Our country is the only one which retains
this profit from its ocean mail. Great Britain expends its entire an
nual mail income from the ocean steamers upon the subsidizing of
British ships. There is a provision for gradually lessening aid. as it
is believed that the subventions would, by increasing the volume of
ship construction, reduce the cost.
A strong argument is also- made upon the good, the bill .will
produce by creating a great force of naval volunteers who would
be of so much value in case of a foreign war.
NEGRO PROGRESS.
INDUSTRIAL and intellectual improvement in (he condition of
the negro race is accompanied in the same degree with improve
ment of their moral and religious life. In this fact Booker T.
Washington expresses his faith in a report he makes which is
published in a recent issue of The Outlook. For the purpose of
illustration he selects one county in the South to show how gratify
ing is the progress of the colored people when the conditions are
right for giving them the opportunity to advance. The place chosen
is Gloucester County, in the tidewater section of Eastern Virginia.
North and South will be pleased at the information he gives about
his people in that one county, for it evidences- what can, and prob
ably will, be done in other parts of the country.
The population of Gloucester in 1890 was 12,832, and about
half were negroes. This is one of the counties of the South that
has been longest under the influence of Hampton Institute, where
Booker Washington was trained to fitness for his remarkable career.
Graduates of other centers of education are also doing good 'work
in Gloucester County. The two sets of schools, colored and white,
are given equal advantages. They are open from five and a half to
six months in the year, and the teachers are paid about the same
in blaj# schools as in the white. Most of the teachers arc
natives of*ftie county, and what to Washington's pet idea is more
important, most of them own property. The negroes of this county,
beginning in poverty forty years ago, are now paying taxes on one
sixth of the real estate, principally in small farms from ten to
one hundred and fifty acres. A large proportion of them contain
.ten acres. Twenty-five .years ago these- negroes were so poor that
three-fourths of them lived in one-room cabins. Now many of
them have six-room cottages, and the one-room cabin is rare.
This material prosperity*, is chiefly pleasing because of the
moral improvement that' has accompanied it in growth. Bastardy
used to be quite common, but in 1903 there were only six cases in
the entire 6000 of colored population. Moreover there is very little
evidence of immoral relations existing between the two races.
Twenty-five years after the* work of education had been fairly
started the arrests for misdemeanors showed less negro offenders
than white; and in 190^, there were but seven arrests for felonies,
and of these two were white -and five were colored.
Another fact that this sample county is useful for proving is
that the development of education and the acquirement of property
by the negroes do not increase racial friction. A close investi
gation shows that cordial and friendly relations exist between the
white and black people. Washington is right in his opinion and his
urging that if we all, white and black, and North and South, do our
whole duty, this fine improvement is Gloucester can be equaled
or surpassed in other" parts of the South.
THE Democracy is just now engaged in gazing raptly upon two
chiefs, each a candidate for the Hi-you-muckamuckship. Mr.
Hearst is occupied in a visitation among the political provinces
and in filling his ears with the syrup of adulation. He (is also
dreaming dreams in which the White House looms large and at
tractively. Mr. Bryan has gone far abroad, and "is seen in a per
spective of 240 degrees of longitude. He is marching over flower
strewn paths under triumphal arches in the Philippines.
The .appearance of these rivals is interesting, though they have
put the ponderous bulk of the globe between them. The Democratic
party has gone on record as opposed to our 'position Jn the Philip
pines. The last two campaigns got all of their piquancy from that
opposition. The speeches made upon it would fill several barrels.
Now the party seems to have no choice, but nkist take one or the
other of two men as leader who have records on Philippine acquisi
tion. When our policy as to the Philippines was in 'doubt and; un
formed Mr. Hearst carried at the head of his papers'Tin obese letters
the legend, "Nail the Flag to the Philippines. Don't Raise it There,
Xail it!" Well, the treaty of Paris nailed it there, the'} nails land
hammer costing $20,000,000, much to the regret of many of the
When the treaty of Paris was before the Senate and ; its 'Â«aiTferit!r
ment before ratification seemed certain Mr.3ryan descended upon
Washington and brought over .to the treaty v the Democratic" votes
necessary to its ratification and it became the! supreme law 'of: the
land, the flag was nailed there, we got the :> Philippines and Spain
got S20,ooo,ooo and a licking. Now Mr. Bryan is touring the islands
and making very conservative speeches to the natives, who Ware'
paving him exceedingly conspicuous attention. >;_He is walking on
the clouds from Manila to Mindoro,; and -from Bucas-to.Bislig. But
Mr. Hearst i.v looking ove^his fences, from , worm to barbed wire,
at home. At this moment it is impossible to tell which leads. Mr.
Bryan is known for his superior wind, but Hearst may beat him in
bottom. . . . . . ' .

THE THIXG I WROTE.
I WROTE a little thing one time, a
, rather foplish lay.
That gurgled on and chattered on- in
quite a senseless way.
And I said, "I know it's awful, and
'twill hit them like a blow,"
But some one was yelling "Copy!" so I
had to let it go,
And it got into a paper â I never will
know how â
And echoes from that dratted thing
\u0084 are lingering with me now,
For. people meet me and they say, "You
wrote that thing! Oh, my!"
The little, wobbly, woozy lay is all
they know me by.
"Dear me!" they say,
"That clevah v lay!
It was so cute, you know!"
While I would sell
Myself for â well,
Some seven cents or so.
I've tried to write some better things,
a compress on my brow,
But, oh, that razzle-dazzle .. lay is all
that lingers now.
I know not where . the moral lies, and
yet it must be clear \u25a0_\u25a0/
To any man, and every man, that one
is hidden here.
Perhaps a rage would pjut.it thus: "If j
cap ana bells you pick, . !
Why, play the game for all its worth
and do not lose a trick;
Perhaps he'd wisely counsel thus: With
men, as 'tis with fish,
The bait the world doth give to us is
not the bait we wish. ;
It does not matter; this I know, and
this I sayâ alas!- â
If you'd win out, heed Corwin's words
â¢ and be a solemn ass,"
Unless you'd choose,
To meet your views, .;....
To hear them say "That one! . '
That cute bon mot!"
When 'tis you know,"
The worst you've ever done.
Oh, you may do or write some things
of .higher, better plot.
But just one razzle-dazzle thing will
queer the whole blest lot
SHORTLY AFTER CHRISTMAS.

Christmas cheer.

I sang of Christmas gifts and grace, and
also. Christmas loveâ ; . ,
The . latter .' word, I recollect, ' I neatly
rhymed with "dove"â
I warbled on. and lilted, on in quite a

But Just one line of all I wrote doth give
me peace to-day,..
For now that i Christmas day Is past I
wish to mention here,
I'm highly gratified to know it "comes

My daughter Ethel presents bought and
had them charged to "pa," -
And so did Annabel and May and Laura

used to that;
But, oh, it pains and pains again, and

Then let us chant In reverent tones, "It
comes but once a year!"
I love the merry Christmas time, its festal
cheer and loveâ

sweetly rhyme With, "dove" â
I love the keepsakes that it brings, for

THE DELEGATES
HAD TO LAUGH
]T was at the closing session of the an
nual convention of a certain religious
body held in a town near this <slty
some time since, and the preacher who
occupied the chair announced that they
were $100 short of a desired sum and
hoped that the amount might be raised
before final adjournment, says tne Phil
adelphia Telegraph.
"I will start the good work with $25!"
cried a man who was a stranger to the
preacher.
"Thanks, brother! Thanks!" exclaimed
; the dominie, effusively. "I don't know
j your name, but may heaven bless your
kind heart, and may your business during
the coming year be doubled!"
Instantly there was a laugh that was
both long and loud, and the perplexed
preacher gazed at the delegates in aston
j ishment.
' '"What have I done?" said he.
"Whatâ" ;>'
â¢ "Nothing," Teplied a fellow preacher;
"only the man who donated that twenty
live is an undertaker."
STUCK TO HIS THEORY.
Arthur E. Bostwic*., the head of the cir
culation-department of New York's free
libraries, tells this story about a German
professor of Jena, who belonged to the
; Haec # klin school:
i'The professor got shipwrecked off a
tropical island. As soon" as the ship
struck the old gentleman leaped over
board '\nd swam ashore.
"But no soener was he on dry land than
he turned and plunged into the water
again, and swam back to the ship.
"He seized . his stout wife ,in his arms,
leaped headlong overboard, and, despite
his burden, again reached shore in safety.
"There the captain, who had already
landed,- said to him in an amazed tone:
". 'Why didn't you save your wife the
first time?'
", 'Ah,' 'said the professor, with a satis
fled smile, 'I was bound to save myself
tirst, you know. Self-preservation , Is na
ture's highest law.' "âNew York Tribune.
NATURE PROMPTS IN BENTIONS.
'"We. get our hints froni . nature," the
inventor said. "Take, for instance, the
hollow pillar, which is stronger than the
solid one. Th* wheat straw showed us
the superior strength of the hollow pil
lar. Solid, the wheat straw would be un
able to^support its head of grain.
"Where did man get his idea for car
riage springs? From the hoofs of the
horse, which, like the springs derived
from them, are made from parallel plates.
"Scissors; we get. from the ; Jaws of the

THE SMART SET
â¢ A spectacle of masrnifieance. such as
is seldom seen In professional extrava
ganza, will be presented to the quests
of Mr. and Mrs. M. H. de Young: to- ,
morrow evening In their private ball- |
room. Because of the Sabbath, all are >
bidden for the hour of 11:30. when j
supper will be served, and at mia
night the stage festivities will begin
for the delight of those at table.
For cleverness this vaudeville per
formance will without doubt supersede
all ever offered before in San Fran
cisco's talented realm. The gowns arc
so gorgeous as to pale the memory of
others donned for private theatricals,
while all stage accouterments â set
tings and lights â are to demonstrate
the climax of art in arrangement and
electrical effects.
Heretofore Mrs. de Young has
showed her efficiency In the manage
ment of stage proceedings, but on this
occasion Frank Blair, formerly of this
city, will take full charge. The pro- ,
gramme is one round of delightful,
clever "stunts." all new from London,
some not having even reached New
York, and from these have been im
provised many local hits upon promi
nent affairs and personages. These
parodies will serve to show more
clearly than all else the real wit
and originality of our smart folk. |

Kathleen de Young, Mrs. Mark Gerstle.
Miss Ethel Hager. W. H. Smith Jr..

NEED FOR TENDERNESS.
/SYMPATHY is a fine thing, and one
of the distinguishing mark 3 be- j
<-*- tween man and the lower ani
mals. But the very fruit and flower !
of sympathy is tenderness. Based on
comprehension and right feeling it
will go far toward idealizing our na
tional life. For we are a sentimental
people and need only to distribute the
product of -our sympathies aright to
do away with every evil in the body
politic.
The opposite of tenderness â in man.
as in the turkey â is toughness. But it
is au attribute of something more than
the physical man. We all know that
there is mental and spiritual and moral
toughness as well as material or bod
ily toughness. But we do not always
act upon the knowledge.
It is no bad thing to have a body
that withstands the demands of mod
ern life, that' is able to meet not only
the winds and frosts of winter, but
the rush and strain of the workaday
world. It is a distinct advantage to
possess a tough and well-seasoned
body, and the man who has to live to
day is handicapped without it.
But it is not an advantage to own a
conscience whlcly is toughened, either
to the possessor of it or to his neigh
bors. It is not an advantage to meet
a mind which is so inured to suffering,

It is not an advantage to build up a

Nor Is it enough to have a mind, a

There must be something positive â
and this something is tenderness: "HÂ«

It is easy to bft tender toward a

discreditable as it Is not to be tender
toward them, it is no particular credit

comes in being tender to those who
do not invite, nor seek, nor expect ten

RUSSIAN CHURCH
FAVORS UNION
Committee to Investigate
Episcopal Common Prayer-
Book Ordered by Synod
FELLOWSHIP IS FAVORED
Archbishop Tiklion, Former
ly of This City, Initiates
a Kemarkable Movement
The Russian Church of North America
has been taking a deep Interest in the
Protestant Episcopal movement toward
church federation, and in order to obtain
an expression from the Russian Synod on
the question of union Archbishop Tikhon
of the Orthodox Csftholic Eastern Church,
who until last summer was established in
San Francisco, conferred with that body
in St. Petersburg as to the part the
church here might take in the matter.
As a result of the inquiry a committee
was appointed by the synod to lirst in
vestigate the American Common Book
of Prayer. After studying the book the
synod's committee reported its views of
the differences in expression and under
standing as conveyed in the Protestant
Episcopal prayer book and that of the
Russian church.
Some of the main points studied by the
Russian committee were: "The Order for
the Administration of the Lord's Supper,
or Holy Communion," "The Consecration
of Bishops and the Ordination of Priests
and Deacons," "The Order of the Sacra
ment of Baptism," "The Order of Con
firmation," "The Order of Matrimony,"
"The Sacrament of Penance." "Extreme
Unction," "Faith in the Saints," "Order
of the Burial," "The Order of Blessing of
Church or Chapel," "The Order of Insti
tution of Ministers Into Parishes or
Churches," "Prayers and Thanksgivings
Upon Several Occasions."
The finding of the Russian committee
was extremely conservative, disagreeing
oh many forms and expressions which
were not in strict agreement wi k - the
teachings of the Russian church.
The synod still hoping to bring about
closer relations with the American Epis
copal Church determined to send the com
mittee's request to Archbishop Tikhon
so that he, being in closer touch with the
dogmatists of the Episcopal church here,
would be in a better position to obtain a
clearer interpretation of the common
prayer book.
Archbishop Tikhon thereupon decided to
appoint a committee of the clergy of the
Russian church in the United States and
to invite a similar committee composed of
Protestant Episcopal clergymen or re
nowned theologists among the laymen to
confer on the report of the synod's com
mittee.
The result of the archbishop's step to
ward this fellowship of the two churches
is awaited with keen interest by ardent
churchmen who support the movement for
federation of church bodies.-
SAYS FIRE HORSES
ARE UNSERVICEABLE
Inspector Declares Steeds in
Ten Companies Are Un
fit for Duty.
The horses in ten of the engine com
panies are unfit to respond to second
alarms of fire, according to a report sub
mitted to the Board of Fire Commission
ers yesterday by Inspector W. J. Tobin.
The report is as follows:
"I herewith report to you that I have
made an examination of the horses in the
Fire Department and I find that those of
the following companies cannot be de
pended on for second, third and subse
quent alarms: Engines 1. 4, 6, 7, 10, 12,
15, 19 trucks 3 and chemical 7."
Charles Burns, a hoseman who "got
himself into the hands of the brokers,"
signed over $70 of his salary to his wife.
In doing so Burns fiercely denounced the
j brokers.
"With this arrangement you are given
a chance to"â began Commissioner Finn.
"Chance," exclaimed Burns. "You ain't
got a chance with a broker. â¢ Why, a year
ago I got $70 and kept paying all the
time. Then I was jumped and told that
I owed $84 and that if I didn't pay, my
salary would be held up. You ain't got
no chance with them."
The case of Charles Flemming, driver of
truck 7, who was reported by Captain
Carew for being eight seconds late in an
swering an alarm, was taken under ad
visement.
Hoseman J. Pine was ordered to forfeit
pay since December 21. He was injured
at that time and refused to report for
house duty.
Hoseman J. Mitchell of truck 7 was or
dered transferred to truck 8 on request of
his captain.

CHURCH UNION
NOW ASSURED
Two Denominational Bodies
of the Presbyterian Faith
Are About to Consolidate
REACH AN AGREEMENT
But One Dissenting Tote Is
Cast on the Question of
Merging the Organizations
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 29.â After a division of
almost one hundred-years steps were con
summated to-day in the joint session of
the general sessions, . which, when form
ally : ratified, will unite the Northern
Presbyterian church \ of the United States
of America and the. Cumberland Presby
terian church. Almost two; days have
been consumed- by sub-committes in ar
ranging details for the : union. Their re
ports were submitted to the general com
mittees representing each church this aft
ernoon. Within two hours -the two- gen
eral committees had met in joint session
and agreed upon a basis for the union
of the two denominational bodies. .;\u25a0 This
agreement will be reported! to the general
assembly of the Presbyterian church,
which will meet at Dcs Moines, lowa," on
May 17, 1906, and to the Cumberland Pres
byterian church, which will mccV in De
catur, 111., on the same date. After
formal ratification by these two executive
assemblies the official announcement will
be made that the union of â¢ the two
churches has finally been consummated.
The general committee of the Cumber
land Presbyterian church had its full
quota of twenty-one members present.
Only sixteen of the t~enty-one members
of the Presbyterian general committee
were present.
HOLD EXECUTIVE SESSION.
The Joint session was executive in char
acter. It was stated .* that . on the- joint
ballot on the question of the proposed
union there was but one dissenting vote.
It was iurther stated that wh^n the
Cumberland committee 1 was ' appointed
seven men known to be m : opposition to
the proposed union were placed ' on the
committee. The vote to-uay inuicated
that six had changed their minds.
The report adopted in the joint ses
sion of the joint committee declares
that the confession of faith of the
Presbyterian church of the United
States of America, as revised in 1903,
and the other doctrinal and ecclesias
tical' standards of that church have
been constitutionally adopted by the
Cumberland Presbyterian church, as
has also the joint report prepared by
these two general committees two
years, ago; that the union of the two
churches has been fully agreed to by
both and it is recommended that im
mediately after the foregoing effects of
the steps thus far taken have been
announced the confession of faith and
the other doctrinal and ecclesiastical
standards of the Presbyterian church
of the United States of America shall
be binding upon the ministers, ruling
elders, deacons, officers, churches, \u25a0 ad
judicators, boards/ committees and all
I other agencies of the Cumberland
Presbyterian church; that when this
announcement has been made by the
moderator of the General Assembly of
the Cumberland Presbyterian church
and that body shall have adjourned
sine die as separate assemblies and
before the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian church . of,, the United
States of America shall adjourn sine
die the moderator of the latter assem
bly shall announce that all of the
Presbyterians of the two churches shall
elect commissioners to the United Gen
eral Assembly of 1907 on a basis of one
minister and one ruling elder for every
twenty-four ministers or moiety there
of; that the ..new moderator of
the Jnited Assembly shall preside over
the United General Assembly of 1907,
and it is recommended that the modera
tor of the Cumberland Presbyterian
Assembly of 1906 shall preach the open
ing sermon of the United General As
sembly of 1907, the stated clerk of the
Presbyterian- Assembly, with the assist
ance of the stated clerk of the Cumber
land Presbyterian Assembly, making
up the role of the United Assembly.
WILL CALL UNITED ASSEMBLY.
Finally, that when the foregoing has all
been adopted and official announcement of
the fact telegraphed by each of- the as
semblies to the other, the moderator of
each assembly shall be empowered to an
nounce that the reunion and union of the
Northern Presbyterian church of the
United States of America and the Cum
berland Presbyterian church has been
fully consummated and will be henceforth
in full force and effect.
It Is provided. that all boards, commit
tees, trustees and other agencies of the
Cumberland Presbyterian church that
have hitherto been required to report to
the general assembly of that church shall
report to the united assembly in 1907 and
thereafter/ unless these boards or other
institutions shall be united with similar
existing Presbyterian organizations. " ,
All other details as to property rights
of boards, colleges, etc., the question of
recommending the place of meeting of the
United Assembly, suggestions as to the
presby terlal and synodlcal members and
lines and other adjustments that may be
come necessary, were referred by the gen
eral committee to the sub-committees for
further consideration and final report to
the general assemblies.
In 1810 the \ Cumberland Presbyterian
church was organized in Dixon County,
Tennessee, by three "Presbyterian minis
ters who had withdrawn from , the : Pres
byterian church. The division arose con
cerning the extreme doctrine of predes
tination and' certain other questions ;of
practices in ordination of minister s '* who
did not fully conform to classical Btand
u-is of, the Presbyterian church, those
who protested insisting that the Â° exigen
cies |of frontier , life demanded occasional
exceptions to, the established rule.

3:45 a. m. on Thursday and San Fran
cisoo at 12:43 r>. m. on Friday. Under

WELLS OWES HIS EX- WIFE
A LARGE SUM OF ALI3IONV
Son of Late Auditor Is Cited by Judge
Graham to- Account for His
Conduct.
George A. Wells, son of the late Au
ditor Asa R. Wells, has been cited, by
Superior Judge Graham to show cause
why he has failed to pay his former
wife, Mrs. Josephine Wells, alimony,
as ordered. Wells has been so lax in
his duty, as set forth in the order, that
the alimony judgment against him now
amounts to more than $3000. He will
appear next Friday and offer such ex
cuses as he may possess, but whether
or not they will be accepted by the
court remains to be seen.
Judge Seawell has taken under ad
visement the" action for divorce insti
tuted by 'Theodore 'B. against Kathcr
ine O"i>onnell Lyman. Mr. and Mrs.
Lyman were married in New Orleans
in 1896" and he alleges in his divorce
complaint that she deserted him six
months after the ceremony. He says

intemperance; Mary against F. Mid
dleton for willful neglect, and William
T. against Nellie Cothran for deser

FIELD TRIALS
DRAWING NEAR
Crack Setters and Pointers of the Coast Are
Being Prepared by Their Handlers.
Down on the broad acres of Haggln &
Tevis* in Kern County a half score of
skillful handlers are preparing the finest
dogs of the coast against the
day early in January when they will/be
called upon to compete in the field trials.
These Jiighly bred setters and pointers
sre^the property of representative sports
men from various parts of the coast, the
majority of whom will be on hand to see
their favorites perform in the field. These
trials share with foxhunting and with
polo the highest place in the realm of out
door sporta.
In' v q them has entered no trace of com
mercialism. They represent sport for
eport's (take. Under the rules ofHJie club
lwlting is not allowed. During the course
cf the trials, which usually continue a
\u25a0werk. there is never a hint of a bet of
Rny^character whether in money or other
vrisei There are valuable prizes, both in
money and in plate, and these are never
discussed. The money usually. goes to the
handler of the winning dog, the owner
taking the plate to commemorate the
event.
It is purposed at the forthcoming meet-
Ing to run the members stake on the first
day when enthusiasm is at its height- The
etake has been hedged about with re
strictions this year to make It what Its
name implies. The idea Is to bring out
the member* with their regular shooting
dogs, sometimes called by the Irreverent
-meat dogs" instead of with some highly
developed pointer or setter from the
miring cf their handler. C. H. Babcock.
the clever handler who has charge of the
extensive kennels of W. W. Van Arsdale.
â¢writes entertainingly of the difference be
tween the field-trial dog and the shooting
dog: as follows:
What is the difference between the field-trial
dog ana the shootlng-dogr What Is the dif
ference la their work? Are they trained dif
ferently? These question* are many time*
w;ked of the neld-trlal man by those Interested
In the Bhootlng-dog, and the answers are many
â¢nd varied.
Those of the old guard uaually inelst that
any dog that Is & good onÂ« to ret birds over la
a. rood fleld-trlai doe. and the more "killing"
fee Is the higher he ranks In their esteem; for
they c*!m that bird-getting Is the logical pur
pose of the field-dog.
Pace end rar.ffe are entirely secondary m
their estimation. Vrhat they want and must
have Is point-work, r.rn. iaÂ« and all the time,
arid It makÂ«Â« IRtle difference how this is ac
compliehed to long as the do* shows his ability
to fill the goraebas. None of your hlgh-Mrunr.
*iae-flunÂ« floss for them. Give them a dog
that stays in *lsht. feols for the fainteÂ«t scent,
roads up carefully, and, above all nointa
They insist that brains and noee' are the chief
requisite* in thÂ« field-trial dot, and given
these, he will find as many birds as his faster
hracemat* with much less exertionâ in fact
Jets his hÂ»ad save his heels. No dog th~y
claim, can keep up all day a break-neck epeed
Â«a why not award the prize to a dor that
â¢tans in at a pace that he can maintain dur
ing the day's hunt?
At the other extreme we find those who con
sider that a dog that can win In fast com
pany Is surely a good shooting-dog, according
to thtir Interpretation cf thÂ« term. NÂ»t only
that, but a cog to be fit to win in field-trials
must have, first of all. great epeÂ«d and range
With this Is to be coupled a fair degree of bird
cense and point-work.
these two extreme* is a class and
a large one â which U satisfied with fair speed
end rarsgt and a real good degree of bird-sense
end. a fair quantity of point-work.
Every degree between the two extremes has
its admirer*, but really tne IQeal field-trial or
ebooting-dcg Is the one that can combine the
two extremes and the gradations. If a dog is
capable of performing In only one way under
i:l conditions, he Is cure In the course of a
field-trial career to find that conditions wern
ftgalust feira the greater part of the time and
lie is branded as an erratic performer.
\u25a0 There it a certain kind of dog that every
handler > ratiefled to hare in his string when
'\u25a0 < takec is a circuit of trials, and handlers
â¢re, as a general rule, pretty good Judges of
irhat ft field-trial dog should be. This dog is,
f.rst of all fast and a stayer In all kinds of
leather. Be mast also be wide in ranee wber*
DOGS OF THE SPORTSMEN ARE NOW IN TRAINING
Jt Is required. This will bÂ« more imooJ i* "Â«
where the dogrs are worked on ground thai is
not likely to hold any bird*. -In some In
stances the dogs may be cast off in a perfectly
barren stretch of ground with no birde nearer
than a ir.ile distant. Here is wher* your close
or medium range dogs are likely to make a
sorry display end are lucky If they are carried
into the next series. Working around near
their handler, there is absolutely no possibility
that the/ will find any birds. This is the real
test of the field-trial dog, lor it is his duty to
go to birds, and after a cast or two to satisfy
Hmeelf away he Roes on a cast of a mile or so.
If ho is lucky enough to find birds out there,
and holds them until his handler comes up,
he hs.8 made a long stride toward winning the
stake.
The keeping of a high class kennel
of field trial dogs is a luxury. One
gentleman who derives much pleasure
from his dogs acknowledges they cost
him JlO.OOO a year. All the othÂ«r es
tablishments are more modest than
this, but the breaking and the keep
of even one high class dog Is an item.
The dogs in the members stake are
not limited to a certain time in the
field, being allowed work at the dis
cretion of the -Judge. In the Derby
and in the all-age event the dogs must
be down at least thirty minutes in the
first series. In the remainder of the
stake they are allowed work at the
discretion of -the judge, who may be
satisfied at the expiration of five min
utes as to which dog is the best
worker.
\u25a0The most severe test Is in the cham
pion event, in which the trial lasts two
hours, during which time courage,
staying pow*r and other qualities are
severely tried. The dogs are going at
top speed the major portion of this
time.
While the dogs show tremendous
pace and wide range they are/ con
stantly under control of the trainer.
They reepond at once' to the sound of
his whistle or other . signal. R, .M.
Dodge directs the movements of hi 3
dogs by waving a handkerchief to in
dicate the direction in which he wishes
them to work.
This caused one fair follower of the
trials last year to "remark: "I wonder
what Mr. Dodge would do if he left
his handkerchief at home? 1
After several h'lurs .in the crisp win
try air the thoughts of the partici
pants.turn naturally, to luncheon. This
is served either in the field or In some
near-by farmhouse. The luncheon has
for its foundation such substantiate a's
hard-boiled eggs, hot beans, cold roast
chicken, ham. hot coffee and other
delicacies. The gentlemen who are ac
customed to elaborate fare .at their
clubs stand about, the wagon and
break the eggshells:: on the iron tires.
One in a group will hold a saltshaker
and In turn distributes its contents as
the hungry sportsmen hold out their
fggs for a dash- of the condiment.
Others display unexpected â¢ talent in
opening cans of sardines.
\u25a0 The. persons' reach .the field, in sur
reys and then many elect to follow
the dogs on foot or on horseback.
When tired it is the custom to;' take
the first vacant seat which presents it
self, .if not bein? necessary to wait for
one's own vehicle.- It is the same with
the saddle horses, many men . appear
ing'in one saddle during the day.'.
The trials are a rest from the busy
whirl ; of ' the city. The utmost good
fellowship prevails and there are no
distinctions of class, all being out with
but one purpose, that of. seeing deter
mined which is the best dog among
those in competition: When the de
cision of the Judge, Is made known,
usually on the .roadside, the owner of
the winner is warmly congratulated

in the Event
NOTED PLAYER DIES
A. H. Brabant of the Park
Club Passes Away in
His Prime Suddenly
The most important and the most inter
esting event held on the tennis courts in
years will commence to-morrow on the
California Club courts. It will be a round
robin scratch singles event. In which the
best players in the city have been invited
to compete.
1 Eleven players were Invited to take part,
i but there will be only nine in the com
petition, . two having declined. The latter
are Coast Champion George Janes and
Percy Murdock. The absence of these ex
perts will hurt the tournament, but not
to any great extent. Murdock has not
had a racket in his hand for weeks and
figures he could not even make a showing
In his present form.
Janes also figures he could not do him
self justice, and although he has been
playing regularly he says he is not play
ing the game he did. earlier in the year.
There was some uncertainty as to wheth
er Griffin would play. He has not noti
fied the tournament committee as yet, but
his clubmates declare he will be on hand.
With Janes and Murdock out of the
way Charles Foley and Clarence Griffln
look to have the best chance to win. On
account of his victory In the bay counties
championship tournament, the Golden
Gate Park contingent figure Foley w|ll
win easily. /
Griffln has had daily practice of late
and Is playing the game better than he
ever did before. He will have no excuses
to offer if he fails to win. He has a won- ;
i derful amount of nerve and self-confi
dence, and these, with his skill, will make
him a hard man to beat.
Herbert Long has been practicing con
stantly for two weeks and is playing, a
greatly improved game. He has been tak
ing his brother Melville into camp of late, i
and is probably as clever'as any player
In the club. Many have been counting
him out, but he will be likely to prove
a big surprise. r
Melville Long, Herbert Schmidt and
Harry Rolfe all have a good chance to
win. They are evenly matched, and it
would not occasion much surprise if either
of the three carried off the honors.
Fred Adams and George Baker have
undoubtedly gone back and in, their pres
ent form are not figured to win many
matches. Earlier in the year both
have been conceded a royal chance to
win.
George Busch is not figured to have
much chance to win first place. He is un
steady and his condition is anything but
good. Busch. will make trouble for some
of his opponents, but he is conceded little
chance to win.
Each player will be called upon to play
two matches a day. As there will be but
nine" in the competition half of It can be
completed on Sunday and Monday. AH
matches will be two sets out of three., The
courts of the California Club, as usual,
will be opeivto the general public, and It
is expected the event will draw an un
usual number of spectators. Play, will
commence at 10 a. m.
The next tournament of the Golden
Gate Club will be held January 7. It will
be a class singles event. The first and
third classes will probably met on the 7th
and the second and fourth classes on the
14th. Tills order may be changed, as most
of \u25a0 the players in the first class are en
tered in the California Club event.
A. H. Brabant, a popular member of
the Golden Gate Club, died suddenly of
ptomaine poisoning during the week. He
v/an an active and an enthusiastic player
and will be greatly missed at the park.
He was a native of New Zealand and
was -a member of .a wealthy family.
There were hints of a romance in his life.
In which he iÂ» said to have married in
accordance with -his father's wishes, but
against his own inclinations. Shortly after
his wedding he came . . to this country
alone. He was of athletic build, and his
untimely death was deplored by his asso
ciates. . \u25a0

Best League Match Sunday-
Is That Between Vampire
and Independent Teams
Last Sunday was a blank one, so far
as matches for the championship of the
California Association Football League
were concerned, but four contests for
first place In the 1905-1906 season will
take place to-morrow. Two of these
are in the neighborhood of San Fran
cisco, while two are out of town en
gagements.
The moat interesting and keenest
contest will be between the Independ
ents and Vampires on the ground at
Freeman's Park. Oolden Gate. This
will begin at 2:30 p. ra., Arthur Robin
son being the referee. When these two
teams met on Sunday, the 3d lnst, on
the Alameda ground, the Vampires won
by a score of two goals to nothing. Tha
Independents are eager for an oppor
tunity to turn the tables on the Vam
pires, who always play better on the
Alameda ground than elsewhere. The
Vampires at present have as many
points aa the league leaders (the Oak
land Hornets), and will struggle hard
to maintain this position.
On the ground at Alameda the Eagles
will play against the Albion Rovers,
A. TV. Wilding being the referee. Ths
members of the Eagle eleven are young
and enthusiastic. Though they have
lost the valuable services of F. J. Croll
as goalkeeper, probably for the rest of
the season, W. J. Richter makes a good
substitute. - Some of the Eagles are
quite fast- on their feet, and, though
they lack combination, they play a
hard game, no matter who their oppo
nents are.
The out of town matches will be
played at Sacramento and Santa Cruz.
The Oakland Hornets leave this after
noon. for the capital. During their
'stay they will have the use of the
gymnasium, baths and reading-room of
the Young Man's Christian Association,
in recognition of the fact that several
members of the Oakland Hornet Club
belong to the Y. M. C. A. of San Fran
cisco. Half a dozen students of the
University of California who live in
Auburn and belong to the Oakland
Hornets, will come down to Sacramento
to see the game. The Oakland Hornets
will lack the services of Its captain
and fullback. H. R. Elliot, and also of,
its center forward and past captain. J.
C. B. Mackenzie, the former having
been ill recently and the latter having
gone stale. The team will be made up
of McÃltchie, goalkeeper; J. McGregor
or Gilchrist. right back; Yon Helms,
left back; Bird. McLachlan and. Duncan
11, halfbacks; Chfist.ensen and J.
Smith, right wing; Chambers, center
forward: Warburton and Duquesne,
left wing.
The San Francisco eleven will Jour
ney, to Santa Cruz, where' they will
play against the Santa Cruz team on
the ground In Vue de l'Eau Park, John
Cameron, secretary of the C. A. F.
League, being the referee.
As no league matches were played
last Sunday, the table of results for
the 1905-1906 championship of the
league ' remains as given in The Call
last Saturday.
Edgar Pomeroy, the well-known Oak
land Hornet, and Arthur Robinson,
treasurer of the California Association
Football Union, are busily endeavoring
to organize a Saturday league, which
seems likely to open with four clubs,
viz.. the Oakland Hornet Reserves, the
Olympics, the Pirates of Oakland and
the Berkeley Wasps. It fs possible the
Seamen's Institute and a new club be
ing formed by some young men who
are employed in city offices may come
Into the Saturday League. A meeting
will be held soon to elect officers, draw
up a schedule of games and make other
necessary arrangements. If the pro
moters 'of the new orgflanization are as
successful as they hope to be, the series
of Saturday league games will begin
early in February.' , \
.Patrick ODea, formerly captain of
the Wisconsin University football team
and holder of the American record for
kicking field goals. Is in San Francisco,
which will be hf3 headquarters as Pa
cific Coast manager of the Western Oil
Transportation Company. He is an
Australian and held the championship
of his province for long distance kick
ing. He is a first-class Association
football player and was engaged as a
coach for the Association football team
of Wisconsin University, but soon after
arriving at Madfson, Wis., he received
and accepted the offer of the oil com
pany. He weighs about 175 pounds,
and is enrolled with the Oakland Hor
nets. In whose team he will play as
soon as a vacancy occurs.
The Sacramento Association football
club is gaining strength and now has
seventeen duly registered playing, mem
bers. â¢ It Is unlucky that H. G. Macart
ney, the captain and center forward, I*
unable to play on account of illness
and that Gillchrest, who has rendered
great service in the back line, is re
turning to San Francisco, where he la
enrolled with the Hornets.
The Oakland Hornets offered to re
play the match played against the Al
bion Rovers on the 10th lnst. and the
officials of the League gave the neces
sary consent, provided . that the game
should be played before the end of the
league^season. As the Albions have
failed to answer the communication
sent by the Hornets, the latter have
notified thÂ« Albions that the. offer is
taken as declined and that the Hornets
will -demand from the league the two
points surrendered.

â¢Toward Rich Purses Here
Keeping pace with the scramble for
patrOnage under the new admin Istra
* lion is another scramble, that of the
fight-promotin*? clubs for recognition.
All ue candidates having weighed in,
the wiseacres are picking four who are
expected to find favor in the eyes of
Â»the* administration.
â¢ f These four are: Morris Levy, man
ager of the Hayes Valley Athletio
Club; Jim Coffroth and Eddie Graney,
who make up the Yosemite Club; Jim
'Neil and Willie Britt. There is an un
dercurrent of feeling that In the ma
jority of Jim Neil's advertising posters
will be the line, "Manager Neil presents
Frankie Neil." etc., while Willie Britfs
will read, "Presenting Jimmy Britt."
Jim Neil has not been able to break
into the game heretofore. Under the
new order of things he will not have to
dance attendance upon opulent pro
moters, but can match his own boy
whenever he pleases.
A somewhat similar condition pre
vailed for years in an amateur club,
whjch seems to have received a knock
out, recently from which it will
never recover. The. matchmaker did a
â¢thriving, get-rica-quick business by
* also acting as the manager of amateur
â¢fighters. It was claimed a fighter's
chance of securing a match was small
v iless he was under this man's man
agement. As he handed the "medals,"
.especially designed by Uncle Sam in
* the Mint, to the fighters he was always
â¢?urc of his compensation. How the
"Britt-Neil partnership will work out
remains to be seen.
â¢ There is unlimited material upon
*. which to draw for matches without dis
turbing the rest of some of the old
warhorses who manage to attract the
. attention of the promoters.
There is talk of matching Britt with
Young Corbett and Willie Fitzgerald,
\u25a0 although his logical opponent seems to
.* be either Young Erne or Kid Herman,
the boy who beat Eddie Hanlon. Jimmy
Should be ready to take a chance' with
a live one after his long rest.
The more promoters In the field the
better it will be for the fighters, as the
tbp-notcbers can set the clubs bidding
against one another for the choice
* matches.
Determined efforts will be made to
have the' present rule governing "ama
tc.ur permits rescinded. The board now
" An" office requires that a club must be a
' member of the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation before It can secure a permit.
IT jhis rule is rescindod it will open

The fishermen have been reveling in
the sport afforded by the steelhead
trout in the Russian River since the
bar broke. Spectators who were pres
ent at the time said the movement of
the fish resembled a drove of sheep
passing through the water.
One hundred fish were caught on
Monday and nearly this number has
been taken each day since then. The
fish average ten pounds In weight.
The tackle used is an eight-ounce rod,
with 100 yards of Allen's solid ailk

palmon roe or Benn's red fly are the
Cavorite lures.
The best sport has been found in

WHERE DOES HARVARD STAND?
It was the intention of the original
football rules committee to take up the
suggestions made by its members at a
meeting held here threa weeks ago, but
the programme was disarranged by the
action yesterday of .the New York confer
ence. There was much Interest mar'fest
ed as to what suggestions Harvard had to
offer in the way of reform rules -because
of the conference Mr. Reid had with Pres
ident Roosevelt Harvard is the only
Institution represented on the committee
that has not yet presented Its ideas for
eliminating the objectionable features of
the game. Whether Mr. Reid was pre
pared to present his suggestions is not
known.
Paul Dashiel said to-night that the
members of the old committee, owing to
the attacks made on the committee, had
received specific instructions from their
respective Institutions and that whatever
new rules were formulated were to be fol
lowed by the' institutions represented on
the committee. He said the committee
did not assume to legislate for all the in
stitutions in the country. Institutions not
represented on the committee, he said,
did not have to follow the rules the old
[ committee . made.

JURY ACQUITS FRESNO SIAN
WHO SHOT WIFE'S FRIEND
FRESNO, Dec. 29. â To-night, after
being out six hours, a jury declared
Joseph H. Smith of this city not guilty
of attempting to murder J. Frank
Avenall of Fowler. The verdict closes
a case that had its beginning on Sep
tember 22. "On that day Avenall walked
into Smith's office on business and after
a few minutes Smith drew a revolver
and shot Avenall in the back as he
crouched en the floor. .Neither Smith
nor Avenall would talk at that time.'
There was much public interest in- the
t.ffair because of the prominence of the
men, one being cashier of the bank of
Fowler and the other ex-cashier of the
Farmers' Bank*, of 'Selma' and both
members of the Elks. Not -until the
opening statement' of -the defense was
made did any one. know what the de
fense was. * It was that Smith believed
that Avenall had ruined his shome- by
misleading. Smith's wife and as a result
of thut belief tie. became
insane and shot Avenall. The Jury was
out until 11 o'clock to-night. ..

Conspiracy.
CHICAGO, Dec. : 29.â Five officials of
the Carriage and Wagon Workers'
Union of Chicago and two alleged slug
gers, who have been on trial in the
Criminal Court for conspiracy, were
found guilty, to-night and sentenced to
terms in the penitentiary. The severest

Deutsch, member of the executive
board; John Heiden, member of the

The specific case on which the men

Instances that . have occurred In Chi
cago within the last few years.
Last April whilei Chris J. Carlstrom, a
non-union \u25a0; carrlage\ worker, was return
ing home from work from a factory at
which a strike was in progress he was
attacked by two men and severely in-,
Jured.' He died* two weeks later . from
pneumonia contracted. It was said, from
exposure while lying on the frozen ground
after he. had been left unconscious by his
assailants.
Last summer,' when the department
store teamsters' strike was at its height
and an investigation . of , the picketing
methods of the various unions In the city
was being made by the State,*? attorney,
George Mellor, a former president of the
Carriage and Wagon Workers' Union,
turned State's evidence., Mellor declared
that the" union maintained what he
termed a' "wrecking crew," which, 1 , he ex
plained, meant ; a regular, organization of
men who were hired as sluggers to in
timidate* non-union ; men who might de
sire to take the places of strikers.

"The People of Russia and Their Strug

ture by the Rev. Dr. Jacob Nleto at Tem

gregation . numbering fully 600, and the
words of the divine were listened to with
rapt attention. Dr. Nieto said in part:
My plea is for the Russian peopleâ the people
as a ' whole and not for any sectional portion
of It. That 15.000 * Jews have been killed
during: this struggle I deprecate, but I am
Just as sincerely grieved that 250.000 Christians
have laid down their lives In the same 'great
cause. - , .
The Jew of Russia, is a Russian. -and for
centuries has been striving to have himself
recognized. To-day the people of Russia have
recognized him. therefore let - thÂ« Jew in
America do nothing ' that will \u25a0 estrange htm

stands shoulder to shoulder fighting; for free

MISSING CLERK
AN EMBEZZLER
Trusted Employe of Los An
geles Trust Company Has
Been Stealing for Months
IS SHOET LAEGE SUM
Guilt of Accused Is Dis
covered After He Had Left
State on Leave of Absence
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec." 29.â Fred P. Wil
son, a confidential employe of the Title
Guarantee and Trust Company, is miss
ing, and a shortage of more than \u25a0 $20,000
has been discovered in his accounts. The
total amount of his shortage has not
been determined, because the examination
of his books has not been completed, but
It was stated to-night by an officer of the
company, that it may amount to or exceed
$25,000.-
Wilson left here two weeks ago, having
given it out that he had been called to
: his former home at Canon City, Colo., to
the bedside of his dying father. He had
been in complete charge ,of the escrow
department of the title company, and was
implicitly \ trusted. The company, gave
him a cash present ana supplied him
with transportation 'to Colorado. : His
work was placed in charge of an assist
ant, who until only a few days ago failed
to discover anything wrong in the ac
counts. Then by accident it was found
that a certain account which should have
had ?ISOO to its credit was closed on the
books. Further investigation soon showed
that Wilson had been stealing for months.
"The very day .his shortage was discov
ered his wife received a letter from him
from a small town In Wyoming, in which
he stated that owing to financial' troubles
he did not intend to return, and saying
that she -.would soon know the worst.
The letter contains a veiled threat to
commit suicide.
To-night the : wife bitterly denounced
her husband. She stated that several
years ago he had embezzled a large sum
in Canon City, and his aged father had
sacrificed almost his last cent to make
good the amount. Since the couple came
here the wife says Wilson has been lead
ing a fast life, drinking, gambling and
associating with lewd women, all of
which j he ; confessed in his letter. She is
left | without a cent in the world.
No warrant for the arrest of Wilson has
been issued so- far as known, but a com
plaint will be filed as soon as the amount
of his shortage is known.

RIVAL LEADERS

Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nerjnaii and Ex-Premier
Balfour Address Followers
IRISH ISSUE INVOLVED
Foreign Secretary Gray Says
Liberal Party Does Not
Intend to Grant Home Eule
LONDON, Dec. 29.â Sir Henry Camp
bell Bannerman, the Premier,*' and Ar
thur J. Balfour, the former Premier,
respective leaders of the two great
parties now drawn up In battle array
in the United Kingdom, addressed
large 'audiences to-night. The Premier
spoke at Dumferline, Scotland, making
fiscal reform his battle cry. In - an
swering a question he said he did not
favor a separate independent legisla
ture for Ireland, but intimated that
that country should have a legisla
ture subordinate to the imperial Par
liament.
Balfour, talking to a sympathetic
audience at Queen's Hall, London,
asked, ""Will you have fiscal reform or
home rule, for this Is the - true issue
of the campaign?"
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman said
that the Liberals would fight protec
tion and fiscal reform durlngr the cam
paign as they did while In opposition,
while the former. Premier said that
fiscal reforms would be the first great
question with which the Unionist
party would have to deal whenever it
was returned to power, because It was
a question in which the welfare of the
country was bound up.
Balfour plainly indicated that the whole
attack of Unionists throughout the pres
ent campaign would be centered on the
assumed intention of the Liberal party
to give Ireland control of Its own affairs
through an executive body responsible
directly to an Irish elective body. This,
Balfour believed, would inevitably lead to
separation, which he admitted would be
preferable to the continued Parliamentary
turmoil consequent on half-way meas
ures.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman de
voted almost his entire speech to an at
tack on the fiscal propositions of the
Unionists, and said it was the duty of the
Liberals to bun* any party supporting
Joseph Chamberlain.
Sir Edward Gray, the Foreign Secre
tary, speaking to his constituents at Bel
ford, Northumberland, to-day said that
the carrying out of Mr. Chamberlain's
policy would mean the ruin of the na
tional prosperity. He assured hi 3 audi
ence that the Liberals had no intention
of granting home rule, but that they
hoped to do much for Ireland.

SLY.. YORK, Dec. 29.â For practical pur
;-.>(> io-day was the last day of the year on
Jiie. Stock.' Exchange. There are no leans or
dÂ»MveriÂ«>s on Saturdays, leans made on Friday
. carrying over until the following Monday, and
*6i<>cks purt-hatÂ«^l on Friday are to be paid for
â¢ or. "the following Monday, As Monday Is ihe
Neva Year's holiday, the Fettlement lor' to-day's
. transactions in the stock market will be fle
*fiÂ»Â«"tl. ia effect until the turn of the year.
!â¢ "J.'his f3ct w-B9 made the baris of the speculative
furor which pervaded the stock market to-day
â¢ from fctart to finish and carried dealings to the
tis-b-Ynfllinn Fhare level. It was argued that
for the January 1 settlement mu*t
-. >ow t^ c'rynpleted and th<? stress In the money
--rna*rkÂ«-t. must have done Its worpt. As a matter
i" <Â»r.isct, there was less severity in the money
â¢ strinscriO' to-day than on the two previous
\u25a0 *dlj^. The rate, was carried up to 75 per ct-nt
â¢ dvrir-.g the urgent demana ot the first part cf
â¢*he" day. but fell back rather promptly to the
neighborhood of 5u per cent and even oelow
â¢that.. Compared with yesterday, tho monfy
c â¢ market waÂ« rejrardod at-, rasy, and to-day'e
: ' rati-s wcrt cheerfully ana *v*n eagerly paid.
o Ther6 i* a deep-ruoted conviction among the
" speculative continsent in the stock market that
a vast organization exists among- tne m^s't
powfrful iapltuJifts in the country which ia
'argely rerponsiL-le for the severe stringency
*| * 'Money of the last week in the year. The
'"â¢iperatore In sUK-ke of less imposing resources
! assert their belief that the aforesaid powerlul
Bcapita8 capita! ists have accumulated vast resources in
their own hands with the purpose of squeezing
the monty market, forcing out stocks from
other .hands and gathering thorn into their owu
Vith the purpose of realizing the great profits
which are to accrue when the enormous waiting
'demand for etocks deve'opa with the later re
luxatioa In the money market. It is with de
tefiEihatlon to defeat this alleged plan that the
active speculators have cheerfully paid exorbi
zs?nt money ratea rather than part with tht-ir
stocks. Tbe belief In the substantial character
of the accumulation cf stocks was fostered by
thÂ« prominence in the marKet cf United States
Steel, Union Pacific and Amalgamated Copi*-r.
It -is the common assumption of the epeculalive
public that these stocks are the favorites for
purposes of stock market operations of the
moft Influential groups of capitalists in the
country.. The many rumors which were preva
lent yesterday cf expected measures to relieve
ttte mosey t-ituation were not verified in any
o caee to-day. The market closed firm at about
otl^ top. . The strength of the market was so
jKenÂ«>ral at to require no specification. The sen
sational rise in Anaconda was a repetition of
cc tl/r- recent movement in that stock.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec.' 29. â The wheat market was
strong, throughout the entire day. | The firm
ness, however, was more due to light offerings
thaji to toiy great amount of buying, the vol
ume of trading on the whole being moderate.
Commission houses and come of the leading
shorts were the principal bidders. The selling
was chiefly by longs. The principal bullish
factor was a cablegram from Argentina, saying
that harvest operations . were ' delayed by wet
weather The market closed strong, with
prices p'ractlcally at the highest point of the
day. May opened fto to V4Â®>Uo higher at 87@
87ftc to 87Hc advanced- to 87% c and closed
%&%o higher at-87%@57%c. "

bulge in the price of December corn early to
day. The price of old December was advanced
from 50c, the opening quotation, : to 54c, with
scarcely a trade recorded â¢ between those fig
ures. Profit taking caused a severe â¢ setback,

NAPOLI TRIAL
CLOSE TO END
;Accttsed Man Kemains Stolid
/During the Arguments of
v Prosecution and Defense
SHOWS HE IS BLASE
.Opinion of Prosecuting At
torney Is Met by Long
Yawn of Bored Defendant
Aii^elo NapoU. accused murderer of
Giuseppe Bropardo, heard the arguments
â¢f both the prosecution and the defense
6 urine a weary session yesterday. It wu
late when the last word was spoken, and
Judge Cook pave the Jury the option of
"being charged then and there and going
ti\to deliberation immediately afterward,
or of waiting till the next morning. One
by o:ie each juror was called by the clerk
of the court and voted "to-night" or "to
morrow." The first juror said "to-mor
row," and after that they alternated
equally between the two days till the
twelfth, answering "to-morrow" as the
eleventh had done, broke the dead-lock
*nd made the vote seven to five for the
postponement. Outwardly it was a trivial
proceeding, but it had its deeper signifi
cance in that the final "to-morrow" may
have added one day to the threatened
life-ppan of the accused man.
' Whether Napoll harbored this thought
it- doubtful, but it is a fact that the ad
journment brought from him a sigh of re
lief. - Probably this sigh had no other
meaning than mere physicttl, weariness,
lor durins the -whola day he had present
ed an appearance mere stolid than during
the first days of his trial. His thick neck
sxiil twisted in an effort to escape the
Atse-like pressure of his collar, and sev-Â»
â¢â¢era! 1 times the knuckles of his clasped
.hands cracked, but this nervousness
Veenied to come more from physical dls-
Comfort than spiritual uneasiness. All
day he was strangely Inattentive to the
.forensic battle going on before him, for
his life. â¢ TV- \u25a0.?-.. Â»
FIGHTING FOR LIFE.
Assistant District Attorney Whiting
clamored for his neck, his own counsel.
.Treadwell, thundered in his defense, and
he seamed indifferent to both. Once, reach
ins the climax of his speech, Prosecutor
Whiting turned upon him with Ion? accus
ing linger. "Three men," he shouted, "com
mitted this most foul murder, and these
three men were Brasllo, Strano and the
defendant sitting here."
Simultaneously v.ith the last words of
this impassioned accusation. Napoli.
â¢without taking the trouble of putting his
hand to his lips, opened his mouth in a
sonoreus yawn that rang through the
crowded courtroom like cynical bravado.
But it was not that. Napoli. In fact, was
paying no attention. He had not heard
the ringing words, nor seen the accusing
finger pointed at him, and he was yawn-
Ing merely because he was very much
bored.
The courtroom was not crowded yester
day as it had been. During the first three
days the room was filled, every seat
taken, and the aisles were clogged with
compressed humanity. It was a pic
turesque throng, made up mostly of Ital
ian fishermen, swarthy, broad-shouldered,
nautical in appearance, and picturesque
with bright jerseys, red sashes and tarn
o'shanters. Some even had gold rings
passed through their ears. Yesterday,
however, by the orders of Judge Cook the
doors were closed after the seats had been
all occupied, the aisles being left free,
with a distinct cain in ventilation that
more than balanced the loss in local col
oring.
WIFE IS PRETEXT. V- ,
In the throng was the wife of the ac
cused. For three days she has occupied
the same seat inside the outer railing a
humble, sober-clad woman, unnoticeable
except for the dog-like look of wistful
adoration she keeps constantly upon the
accused man who is the partner of her
life., Yesterday morning she came with
three of her four children. They were not
admitted into the courtroom and she took
them home again. She held the young
est, an eighteen months' old baby, in her
right arm, her left hand held the hand
of a three-year-old boy. with big black
eyes, and the boy in turn held the hand
of a little sirl of about live. They got
Into the elevator, and at the first down
ward swoop the baby in arms clasped his
tiny hands, and the older little boy let
out a scream of delight. Later the mouier
came back alone, and sat motionless the
long day, her eyes ever upon the husband
who may be taken from her forever.
The arguments of neither the prosecu
tion nor the defense aimed at strength
of effect. Assistant District Attorney
Whiting confined himself mainly to a
clear summing up of the evidence of his
witnesses. Attorney Treadwell read
transcripts in an effort to show incon
sistencies in the testimony .of 'Thomas
Shea, the only witness who definitely de
clared he had seen Xapoli running after
Brogurdo and shooting on the flight of
January 22. He emphasized to 'the jury
the legal doctrine of reasonable doubt,
but ended by asking "not mercy, but cold
Justice." -;\u25a0%\u25a0'.

MARINERS CHUCKLE

That Lays Out
the Querist
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
A group of grimy seamen in Police
Judge Mogan's court interchanged
handshakes and. apparently found it dif
ficult to repress impulse to applaud
when his Honor pronounced Charles
Blum, first mate of the ship Churchill,
guilty of battery upon the person of J.
H. Rex, a longshoreman watchman.
The exultation of the mariners was
consistent with their estimate of the
defendant's character, as previously ex
pressed by them, individually and col
lectively, in the corridor. If their nar
ratives were credible, Mr. Blum's fame,
as a "bucko mate." exceptionally
equipped with the ungentle qualities
Implied by the adjective, had pene
trated to every port in the Seven Seas.
His quickness to blaze into wrath and
his readiness to smite with fist or be
laying pin the head of the offending
sailorman, regardless of whether, the
offense was intentional cr unavoidable,
made him a veritable terror of the
forecastle under his command.
As he faced the bench and pleaded
with voice deep as muffled thunder Mr.
Blum's external ensemble did not be
lie his reputed Nero-like nature. Square
of shoulder and jaw, and with massive
hands dangling and hooked as seamen's
hands usual ly* are, he was fairly typi
cal of the shipboard tyrant depicted b*y
Russell or Conrad.
Watchman Rex's testimony showed
that the swinging blow delivered upon
hlÃ.Jaw by Mate Blum's rightist was ;
hardly justified by the provocation.
The ship was unloading at the Union
Iron Works and the mate discharged
the watchman for what the latter con
sidered insufficient cause. Not being a
foremast hand on the high seas, he had
the temerity to request an explanation
of his dismissal. The mate,, forgetting
that he was not on the high seas, where
it was Indiscreet for his subordinates
to make reply or reason why. .promptly
swung his fist. The force of the blow
almost sent its recipient overboard.
Sentence was reserved till to-day.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATUTOAYJ^DECEMBER 30; 1J905;
relative to the Incidents of their reunion
they were able to tell Judge Mogan.be
; fore whom they were accused of drunk
enness and disorderly conduct. They pro
fessed to , have no recollection whatever
of the extraordinary conduct credited to
them* by Patrolman P. Peshon, . who
averred that jhe discovered them in the
act of endeavoring to convey a long and
heavy plank, evidently a plasterer's plat
form, up a hill so steep that its ascent
is toilsome to a person carrying no weight
i at all.
| It was in that portion of Little Italy,
; where" Kearny street crosses Broadway
fend abruptly assumes the semi-perpendic
ular,' that the arrests were made. The po
liceman told, the court that; his attention
was attracted to the spot by a crowd
that laughingly applauded the efforts of
the defendants to scale the acclivity with
their burden. Each of the gentlemen had
an end of the plank upon one of his shoul
ders, and Mr. Belasco was leading. As
he plodded upward, his progress being
aided by wooden . footholds extending
across the sidewalk, the plank either
slipped from his shoulder or Mr. Na
varra, upon Whom the brunt of the
burden rested, collapsed, the- result in
either case being the same â failure of the
attempt. â¢ - _
"Three times they tried and fell down
whilo I was watching them," said the
officer, "and how | many tinies they had
tried and fell down before that I don't
know." â¢.
I Nor did he know to whom the plank be
longed, where the. defendants . got it or
â¢where they intended to deposit it, and the
defendants themselves were: equally igno
rant on those points. -
"I think," said the -Judge, "that It
would be a boon to you two gentlemen to
extend the period of your enforced total
abstinence from tippling which began
with your arrest, and the sentence , of the_
court is that you be imprisoned twenty
four hours longer.".,
â¢ â¢ \u25a0.- \u25a0>â¢--_
When she missed her $2500 pearl neck
lace and her fur, boa from her apartment,
Mrs. May Hess, keeper of a "rooming"
house at 271 O'Farrell street, , suspected
that the property had been pilfered by
two of her lodgers, ? Miss Hattle Martini
i and Charles H. Lawson, and the detec
tives to whom she imparted her suspicion
found in Mr. Lawson's possession a "tail" !
which she alleged . had been attached to
the missing boa. To prove her allegation
was well founded, Mrs. Hess invited com
parison of the scent emitted by the, "tail"
with that of a liquid she used to perfume
her garments' a half-emptied bottle of
which she submitted for the test. The
detectives sniffed and considered them
selves justified in arresting Miss '\u25a0 Martini
and Mr. Lawson and booking them for
grand larceny..
As the prosecution depended mainly
upon. the' similarity. of the scents, several
experts |in chemistry and perfumery and
pharmacy were sworn to testify before
Judge ,Conlan, whose morning was large
ly taken up by the hearing. Both the
"tail" and, the. bottle were in court, and
every one connected with the case, and
many persons who had no connection with
it, all â¢ smelled and compared ' and opined

after his commitment had been drawn
Judge Mogan attached thereto'a personal
request to the , Sheriff to make Mr.; Ke
nnedy's incarceration as laborious as pos
sible. ' i
His Honor's reason . for such an
unusual step consisted of I the aggravated
character 'of Mr. > Kennedy's offense. Pa

that they arrested him. in front of the

was pronounced he seemed to experience

laugh. - \u25a0'

scribbled 'the * addenda to' the â¢ commit

COLLINS MUST
BE TRIED AGAIN
Grand Jury Brings Another
Indictment, Charging ; the
Attorney With Perjury
SPENDS NIGHT IN JAIL
Expects to Be Eeleased To-
Day and Will Try to Have
the Proceedings Quashed
Attorney' George D. Collins must
stand trial for perjury once: again.
That was decided; yesterday afternoon
When the Grand Jury brought in an
Indictment against him, charging him
with perjuring himself 'at . his recent
trial. " A bench warrant was issued
and Collins was arrested and taken to
the County. Jail., where he spent the
nJglit. He Â«is confident of being re- i
leased on the i-ecjuired $15,000 bonds
to-day. . y
Although it was well .known ' all
around the Hall of ' Justice that Collins
was/about ' to be indicted. . the Grand
Jury was very, slow In .reaching an
agreement. â¢ It. took the inquisitorial
body nearly - two hours to . return the
Indictment. Three witnesses. Father!
Connolly. William Newnian, Charlotta's
brother, and Th oma s j Curi an, s best man
at Collins' [first wedding, were ex
amined and it was' upo'n their testi
mony that the jury, decided to prose
cute* Collins on. the perjury charge
again. â¢/,', . 7
Father "Connolb^ was the first wit
ness . examined. . He recited- in detail
practically the same testimony he grave
at the recent trial of Collins. ' He told
how he had niarried CfTarlotta New
man and Collins in the Eddy-street
church years ago and was sure of , thtf
Identity of both. He was. closely ques
tioned by^ the jury, but never wavered
In his giving the jury a
{food lead In their case.
ARRESTED OX THE STREET. ;
Curran was next called; He told
how he had acted as best man'at the
wedding and was sure that Collins had
married Charlotta Newman. Then
came Newman.' Charlotta's- brother,
who was. .also positive that Collins was
wedded years ago to her and not to
her sister Agnes as he swore, to at his
recent trial.
Shortly before ? o'clock \u25a0 the : ! Grand -
Jury filed into Judge Lawlor's court
room. The indictment was presented
and placed on a secret file and/ the
Judge issued a bench warrant for the
arrefet of Collins. Deputy Sheriff Mar
tin..Welch was ordered to go and round
up the accused attorney as quickly as
possible. . ;, '
Welch started out on his errand and
fifteen minutes later he spied Collins
coming down Market street.
" "Why, hello. Welch," said the wily
attorney. "I suppose you are looking
for me once, more?".
i "Yes, I was sent by Judge Lawlor to
serve this warrant right away,", said
''\u25a0'\u25a0'
L\TE.\DS TO APPEAL CASE.
"Does the Judge want to see me in
a hurry?' said Collins. ;"I wonder
whether it would be proper for me to
go to his courtroom at once or proceed
to the County. Jail? Oh.^well, I v guess
we had better' go* to jail,"; and, taking
the. deputy by the arm,. Collins led, him
to- a' car, which "they 'boarded and pro
ceeded 'to the retreat ' at -Broadway ! and
Kearny street. .- .
Collins' at once .communicated; with
his attorneys. " Board man and McPlke.
It was too late to! secure the $^5,000
bond, so the accused lawyer concluded
to. wait ;tlll this morning. before tmak
ing any attempt to confer! with t;he in
demnity company. He 'settled down to
spend a comfortable night. in jail and
did not seem to be worried at what
might happen.
"I will make an appeal to . the Su
preme Court to-morrow "morning to
have this case quashed on the ground
thati the first perjury charge was not
settled before the other was brought,"
said Collins. "Imaintainthis is illegal
and that I am being persecuted. .They
cannot make this 'lndictment stick. I
will gain- my .release -in the morning
and begin my fight." ;

YIELDS OFFICE
TO RONCOVIERI
Mayor's Authority to Name
Superintendent Is Upheld
by the Attorney General
PAKDEE IS SATISFIED
Governor Will Not Contest
Opinion and Friends of
.; the Appointee Are Elated
After receiving an adverse opinion from'
the State Attorney^ General yesterday re
garding authority to appoint a Superin
tendent of Schools for the city .and coun
ty of San Francisco, Governor Pardee an
nounced that he 'would rest content' with
the opinion; and refrain from, appointing
Reginald H. Webster to the vacancy, as
he had intended.*:
Mayor Sehmitz .was immediately In
formed, and the word quickly spread that
Alfred Roncovieri was assured of the po
sition. .The friends qf Mf- Roncovieri
were much pleased; to learn that there
would be no contest of his appointment.
! Attorney General Webb In a letter to
the Governor, declares that the | opinion
.formerly, made by him relating to the fill
ing of a vacancy in the Public Adminis
trator's - office comprehends the \u25a0 present
case. The vital points of the opinion fol
low: f .
Any authority which you. the Governor, may
have for filling a vacancy in the office of Pub
lic Administrator must be found in section H
of article V of the State Constitution.
Tou-will note' that the power to appoint
takes effect when ; "no . mode Is provided by
the constitution \u25a0 and law for" filling the va
cancy." In view of this section of 'the con
stitution I am "of opinion that you- have no
power to fill a vacancy In the office of Pub
lic Administrator when -It -Occurs, for the rea
son that there Is a mode. provided by the con
stitution and the law for filling such vacancy.
This conclusion precludes all necessity of de
termining whether at present there exists a
vacancy in the \u25a0 office of Public Administra
tor'ln and for- the city and county of San
Francisco. . '
The mode of appointment to such vacancy
which prevents toe above section of the con
stitution from taking effect is found either in
\u25a0section 8% of article XI of the constitution or
in subdivision 19 of section 25 of the county
government act.
Under section BU. of article XI of the con
stitution of this State, .It* undoubtedly would
have been permissible for the freeholders'
convention to have provided that all county
officers In San Francisco be appointed instead
of being elected, and likewise that such char
ter might have provided; that in the event a
vacancy occurred, such vacancy shall be filled
by election. ' Such provisions .would have been
clearly within the authority granted " In the
constitutional provision above referred to. â¢ The
charter, however, does not take either of such
courses. On the | other hand It provides that
the county officers shall be elected and In the
event of a vacancy that. the vacancy be filled
by an appointment by the Mayor. As the office
of Public Administrator Is a county office and
as provision is : made \u25a0by law authorizing the
Mayor to fill a vacancy in such office, I am
of the opinion that you have no authority to
fill such vacancy. *\u25a0" ?*-':-. -,;'f -' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'

pany vs. the American Can Company,

for the past week In the United States
Circuit Court, Judge Hanford of.Seat
tle presiding, was yesterday decided
unanimously In favor of the defendant.

perts were called by both parties and
a prolonged discussion took place over
the merits of the case. H. W. Pnelps
and John Young of the American ' Can

made a very full and Interesting state
ment concerning the manufacture of
cans, in which they set forth the whole
history of the process.
