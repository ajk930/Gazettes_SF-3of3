The professor argued that university

of the feelings of candidates for col

of questions, including the following:
Do you see anything to love in a lit

Have you sympathy with all good
causes?
Can you look straight In the eye of
an honest man or a pure woman?
Will ft lonely dog follow you?
I>o you believe in lending a helping

Do you believe In taking advantage
of the law when you can do so?
Can you be high-minded and happy
In drudgery?
Can you see as much beauty in wash-

Do you know the value of time and

Are you good friends with yourself?
Do you see anything In life besides
dollars and cents?
Can you see sunshine In a mud pud

Can you see beyond the stars?
Thgf e and other questions the pro
fessor propounded, and every now and

uneasily in -his place.

TO BECOME BRIDE
HAVANA. Aug. B.â The political situa
tion In Cuba Is becoming more critical
with each passing day. The most con
servative persons in Havana unhesitat
ingly say that serious trouble Is brewing
anil that it may break out at any time.
The Spanish business element in Cuba,
especially old Spanish merchants who
know the Cuban character because of
their long experience here, predict
trouble. Some are disposed to rejoice,
for they have never had any faith In the
ability of the Cubans to govern them
selves and they believe that with the
first sign of serious trouble the United
States will return to the island and in
future Cuban commercial interests will
be safely guarded.
While the bitter feeling between the
Liberal and Moderate parties has been
recognized generally as a sort of powder
jliagazine around. which Cuban politicians
have -been playing with torches, the real
seriousness of the situation was not real
ized until the incendiary declarations of
Jose Miguel Gomez; Presidential^ candi
date, were made public. When this can
didate, who was named in opposition to
Estrada Palma, openly said that he did
not propose to obey the mandates of the
Supreme Court, every one realized that
the situation was grave. Gomez said :
"Governments have two ways of win
ning, either by popular will or by bayo
nets. The rural guards number three
thousand. Sixty per cent of this force
is ours, but even if they were not these
three thousand soldiers would not suffice,
as has been shown by experience, to put
down a single district."
The next astonishing thing in connec
tion with these observations of General
Gomez is the fact that the Vice Presi
dential candidate. Senator Alfredo Zayaa,
leader of the Radicals in' the Senate and
one of the best educators and best known
lawyers of Cuba, unhesitatingly and un
qualifiedly approves of evefything Gomez
has said. He has practically said that
if his party does not win at this elec
tion they will appeal to "something else
besides the' ballot."
HONGKONG, Aug. 14. â A meeting of
Chinese called for to-day to discuss the
boycott on American goods was not
permitted by the Government and the
Chinese then formally presented a pe
tition praying for permission to meet.
A strong anti-American feeling Is ap
parent among the Chinese.
With the Empress Dowager's power
weakened by her flight at the time of
the .Peking disturbances and the con
sequent strengthening of the followers
of the young Emperor, the assurances
for tranquillity in the empire are con
sidered far less strong than they were
prior to "the outbreak in 1900.
Foreigners are now Joining with the
importers -of Amerlejui .coods--.aniL.~the
Chinese officials are working ener
getically to suppress the movement.
This situation was emphasized to-day
by the receipt at the State Department
of a cablegram from Rogers, Consul
General at Shanghai, which said that the
boycott situation remained unchanged
and that the apprehension among for
eigners was increasing. The foreigners
fear that the boycott will develop into
a revolutionary movement like that of
the "Boxers" five years ago.
A circular dispatch has been sent to
Minister Rockhill and members of the
consular service, requiring them to
keep the department promptly informed
of any new phase in the boycott situ
ation.
The merchants of other countries at
first heard with secret joy that Ameri
can goods were to be shut out of com
petition with English and German and
other manufactures, but It is now
feared that the boycott movement will
turn into an expression of general an
tipathy to all foreigners which may
have results as serious as were those
In 1900.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Aug. 14. â From a meas
ure which was originated by the Chi
nese in hope of bluffing the United
States Into modifying: Its administra
tion of the Chinese exclusion law. so
that the higrh-class Chinese may be
freely admitted, the American goods
boycott seems to be developing into an
affair which is giving: all foreigners
residing in the Celestial Kingdom a.
great deal of concern.

HAVANA. Aug. B.â The political situa
tion In Cuba Is becoming more critical
with each passing day. The most con
servative persons in Havana unhesitat
ingly say that serious trouble Is brewing
anil that it may break out at any time.
The Spanish business element in Cuba,
especially old Spanish merchants who
know the Cuban character because of
their long experience here, predict
trouble. Some are disposed to rejoice,
for they have never had any faith In the
ability of the Cubans to govern them
selves and they believe that with the
first sign of serious trouble the United
States will return to the island and in
future Cuban commercial interests will
be safely guarded.
While the bitter feeling between the
Liberal and Moderate parties has been
recognized generally as a sort of powder
jliagazine around. which Cuban politicians
have -been playing with torches, the real
seriousness of the situation was not real
ized until the incendiary declarations of
Jose Miguel Gomez; Presidential^ candi
date, were made public. When this can
didate, who was named in opposition to
Estrada Palma, openly said that he did
not propose to obey the mandates of the
Supreme Court, every one realized that
the situation was grave. Gomez said :
"Governments have two ways of win
ning, either by popular will or by bayo
nets. The rural guards number three
thousand. Sixty per cent of this force
is ours, but even if they were not these
three thousand soldiers would not suffice,
as has been shown by experience, to put
down a single district."
The next astonishing thing in connec
tion with these observations of General
Gomez is the fact that the Vice Presi
dential candidate. Senator Alfredo Zayaa,
leader of the Radicals in' the Senate and
one of the best educators and best known
lawyers of Cuba, unhesitatingly and un
qualifiedly approves of evefything Gomez
has said. He has practically said that
if his party does not win at this elec
tion they will appeal to "something else
besides the' ballot."
HONGKONG, Aug. 14. â A meeting of
Chinese called for to-day to discuss the
boycott on American goods was not
permitted by the Government and the
Chinese then formally presented a pe
tition praying for permission to meet.
A strong anti-American feeling Is ap
parent among the Chinese.
With the Empress Dowager's power
weakened by her flight at the time of
the .Peking disturbances and the con
sequent strengthening of the followers
of the young Emperor, the assurances
for tranquillity in the empire are con
sidered far less strong than they were
prior to "the outbreak in 1900.
Foreigners are now Joining with the
importers -of Amerlejui .coods--.aniL.~the
Chinese officials are working ener
getically to suppress the movement.
This situation was emphasized to-day
by the receipt at the State Department
of a cablegram from Rogers, Consul
General at Shanghai, which said that the
boycott situation remained unchanged
and that the apprehension among for
eigners was increasing. The foreigners
fear that the boycott will develop into
a revolutionary movement like that of
the "Boxers" five years ago.
A circular dispatch has been sent to
Minister Rockhill and members of the
consular service, requiring them to
keep the department promptly informed
of any new phase in the boycott situ
ation.
The merchants of other countries at
first heard with secret joy that Ameri
can goods were to be shut out of com
petition with English and German and
other manufactures, but It is now
feared that the boycott movement will
turn into an expression of general an
tipathy to all foreigners which may
have results as serious as were those
In 1900.

measure, although his. nanw is not pub

"The more hopeful feeling which is notice
able here can be traced to the conviction that
M. de Witte. who la thoroughly cognizant of
the views of the Russian Government, would
not continue negotiations at Portsmouth un
lees he had reason to believe that Japan would
reduce her demends sufficiently to render them
acceptable to Russia. The Russian envoys
went to Portsmouth reajdy to make reasonable'
and honorable concessions and if peace is to
result from the negotiations on American soil
Japan also must show an equal spirit of
reasonableness and sincerity In her protesta
tions for peace. Russia believes that tbe
world will recognize that the fault, in the
case of failure, will not rest with Russia."
â¢'The Japanese terms are regarded In Rus
sia a? demands which might be made upon
an utterly crushed and powerless enemy, but
it is absurd to propose them to a power like
Rucsla. which has a half million men in the
flild. facing the enemy. This army is In good
condition and eager foi action. It possesses
many advantages of position and the winter is
coming on, when naval operations would be
Impossible. Vladivostok is splendidly forti
fied and supplied.
"Japan, as well as the world at large, has
persistently underestimated Russia's ftrength
In the field and her financial resources at
home.
"Russia Is honestly and sincerely desirous
of securing an honorable and lasting peace and
to this end has sent her plenipotentiaries to
Portsmouth. They did not journey thither
merely to learn the Japanese demandsâ the
nature of their credentials proves that â but
they went In an earnest endeavor to do every
thing possible to terminate the war In a man
ner compatible with the dignity of a great
nation.
â¢'The terms are regarded in their entirety
as yuitt impossible of acceptance and close
scrutiny haÂ» not removed the very unfavorable
lmrresaion their flret reading has produced
here. If they are not modilled. especially In
the matter of Indemnity and territorial con
cessions, peace, it is thought. U impossible
and the cc-ntinuaace of the negotiations use
less.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 14.â Practically
th-S only hope entertained in blgh Russian of
ficial quarters for a p*ace agreement at the
conference at Portsmouth lies In the expecta
tion that Japan will recede materially from
her terms as published. Official and public

Henryk Sienkiewicz, the Polish novel
â¢ Ist, to detention for an indeterminate
j period in his residence for having sign

' against the Russification of schools in
j Poland. A number of other - notables
| were similarly punished.
Henryk Sienkiewicz. in iiarch last,
published an article dealing, with the
public schools question, in which he
1 described school life in Poland as "a
; round of chagrin, torment and trag

: "The years of youth and adolescence

become social pariaht. that makes par

His marriage with Agnes M. Newman,
he said, had been contracted in his office,
witnessed by Dr. Euston ajid his daugh
ter, Jennie Euston, whose present where
abouts he did not know. He had written
the contract, he said, which he. Agnea M.
Newman and the 1 wttneas.es had signed.
He had given'it to her and had not seen
it. She had continually urged him to go
through a ceremony of marriage, he con
tinued, and he yielded = on May 15, 1889.
when the ceremony was perfomed by
Father Connolly, at St John's Church in
San Francisco. He had drawn $1000 which
she had deposited in the Hibernia Bank
in her name" and>she had assigned it to
him prior to her death..' She was always
acknowledged, he asserted, and was bur
ied publicly as his wife.
1 Higgins produced that license and
certificate of marriage, in which it was
written that the marriage was between
Charlotta Newman and George D. Col
lins. Collins said he\ had signed the
application for a license before it was
filled put, and left a client, James Mul
cahey, since deceased, to get It and
give it to Agnes Newman. The name
of Charlotta Nowman, he declared,
must have been placed In it by error.
The placing of the name of Charlotta
Collins in the marriage certificate, he
further stated, was also a. mistake. He
denied it was in his handwriting, and
said if Mr. Groom, County Clerk, had so
sworn, he was mistaken. /
The testimony of Thomas Curran and
William Newman as to the wedding;
with Charlotta Newman, asserted Col
lins, wus absolutely false. Curran. he
said, did not know whom he married
and Newman was willfully lying, being
eager to do anything crimnial, mean or
diabolical to further the conspiracy
against him.
Collins further stated that the de
position of Charlotta Collins, who he
said had no right to so style herself,
was false. The three children in her
custody, he- asserted, were the. children
of her sister Agnes, the issue of her
with him; He had not sent
""aiS' money to provide for them, but
Would look after th'erri as soon as he
was freed from the conspiracy launched
at San Franc' :vo which now engulfed
him.

Assistant District Attorney of San Fran

extradition for perjury before Judge
Lampman, gave sensational evidence un

representing the State of California. He
says the evidence given of a marriage
between himself and Charlotta Newman
In San Francisco wag utterly false and
was part of a conspiracy framed to per

ried Charlotta Newman, now styling her
self Charlotta Collins, in whose suit "for

the perjury charge is based. He said he
had married her sister, Agnes M. New

Norway at present desires to continue un

however, cannot wait forever, and In a rea

step toward the repeal of the act of

C. C. Berner, president of the Stor

With thi people's expression oÂ£ approval of
the action of the Storthing 1 , our only step can
be to communicate the result of the plebes
cite to the Swedish Cabinet, reiterating the
views previously expressed. If Sweden de
slrts a peaceful settlement and a lasting un
derstanding, she will not insist on asking Nor

In the discussion of the second article,
covering the evacuation of Manchuria, it
is positively stated that Russia won a
victory. Baron Komura. it is declared,
wanted to limit the obligation to evacuate
Marichuria and to surrender special priv
ileges in the province to Russia, where-
RUSSIANS CLAI3I A VICTORY.
To-morrow, in the ordinary proceed
ings, the first stumbling block to a treaty
of peace should be reached. After Port
Arthur and the leases of Liaotung. which
are included in article 4, and which Mr.
<!e Witte undoubtedly Is prepared, with
slight modifications, to accept, comes ar
ticle sâthe5 â the cession of Saghallen. It is by
no means certain that, when this obstacle
i^ reached, it will not be postponed until
all the articles ou which agreement is
easy or possible shall have been disposed
of. If this course is followed, and the
press has high authority for the opinion
that it will be. it will indicate a dispo
sition to put off the real struggle to the
very last, and the longer the conference
endures the brighter the prospects of a
treaty are likely to become.
"Every day they sit," said a high au
thority, "increases the chances of peace."
Mr. Sato eaid to-night that he'eame to
Portsmouth hopeful of a successful issue
of the negotiations and nothing had oc
curred to alter his optimism.
The language of the 1 three articles
adopted to-day will form practically the
text of the treaty of Washington, if one
be- signed, subject, of course, to a final
revision. Each side has agreed to the ar
ticles and they are included in the pro
tocols of each day's session, which are
officially signed by the plenipotentiaries
the next morning. In addition to the
minutes kept by each side there Is an ab
breviated record of the discussions, giv
ing the arguments on every point. These
are daily attested, so that when the con
ference is ended the record of the pro
ceedings will be complete.
Of course, the agreement, article by
article, does not bind either Russia or
Japan until a final agreement Is reached
and the treaty signed. It is. however,
significant that Mr. Sato, while specifical
ly stating that he did not speak of
ficially, gave it as his opinion that each
power had now bound itself to the arti
cles agreed to. - . ?
Japan cannct take The railroad herself.
To place herseif in Russia's shoes regard
ing the railroad would be to militarily con
trol these provinces of Manchuria which
the has promised to return to China. But
Japan U <?ntlt!ed to reimbursement for
the expense to which she has-been put in
restoring the raiiroad below the present
position of LJneviteh's army, rebuilding
the bridges ar.d na r rowing the gauge. If
China could rot rind the money, some
other power or powers might do so and
the road would become hypothecated to
the powers which advanced the money,
as other Chinese roads are to those who
advanced the money for their construc
tion.
It was Mr. de Witte himself who or
ganized the Russu-Chineye Bank in 1595
and who has always been considered the
real organizer of the Chinese Eastern
Company. Mr. Berg, the attorney of the
Russo-Chincse Bank, who owns practi
cally all, if not all, of the shares of thÂ«
read, is attached to the Russian mission.
Both sessions of the conference to-day
are described as "amicable." There werÂ«
\u25a0evtral slight Jars, but none of them ee
rjous. The plenipotentiaries are showing
admirable tempers. The change in the
weather may have been partially respon
eible for the serenity manifested at the
conference table, but it probably would be
too much to say that the fate of such
gigantic negotiations had been affected by
a high temperature and a few thousand
mosquitoes.
!-U.HALIK.\ MAY BE DEFERRED.
There was never any question about
the acceptance on the part of Mr. de
Witte of these "articles." the first two
covering 1 in more emphatic form the
contention of Japan in the diplomatic
etruggle which preceded hostilities.
CHINO-JAPANESE UNDERSTANDING.
The railroad, the building of which
cost Russia an immense sum. estimated
by soa3<? at between $100,000,000 and
1200,000,000. is to go to China. Japan
and Criina. therefore, arranged between
themselves the method by which the
former is to be remunerated and
Japan mipht have a very considerable
portion of rior claim for the "expenses
of the war" liquidated. The railway is
ostensibly the property of the Russian-
Chinese bank, although built by Gov
ernment money advanced through the
bank. and. since its completion, oper
ated, managed and protected by the
Russian Government.

PORTSMOUTH, X. H., Aug. 14.â Tbe
three articles disposed of in the peace
conference to-day were in substance as
follows:
Firat â Rasaia'a recognition at Ja
pan's â¢â¢prrponderstioK Inflnrnr*" aad
apecial position in Korea, wblch, Ita*

the cÂ»vU administration of tbe empire.
It is also declared on behalf of Japan
that she only asked that Manchuria re
main for a certain period under Japanese
control. Only enough time is desired to
enable the armies of Japan to evacuate
the province, and by the time this evac
uation is accomplished it is expected
China Wfll have established the neces
sary system of courts and will be in a
position Ui maintain order throughout the
province.
as Mr. de Witte contended that the obli
gation for evacuation and the surrender
of special privileges should be mutual
and that the evacuation of the troops
should take place concurrently. Mr. de
Witte is said to have contended that he
was defending not only the interests of
Russia, but of all the neutral powers.
On the other hand, the Japanese, claim
they did not resist the demand for simul
taneous evacuation by the troops of both
<< untries. A Japanese authority said to
night:
â¢ Mhe integrity of China is assured if
the treaty of Washington is signed, as
Japan has insisted that this point be set
fcrth in language that can neither be
evaded nor misunderstood. Japan's at-
Utude has already b?en in line with the
Hay doctrine, and Tril! find a more vigor
ous expression in the treaty of Washing
ton."

I could hardly stand my sunVrtng. The awful

EUREKA, Aug. 14.â A dangerous and
what is likely to prove a costly crop pest
has made its appearance in the rich farm
ing lands throughout the Arcata bottom
section, twelve miles north of Eureka.
Thousandsâ of cutworms are devouring
the beet crop. The county Horticultural
Commissioners held a meeting to-day to
discuss ways and means to stamp . out
the pest. The board was unable to -give
financial aid, but recommended several
methods of extermination, which will be
applied without delay. It was reported
to the board that hardly a ranch in the
Arcata section Is free from the pest.

Grunsky will go to Portland, Ore., in
a few days to confer with F. H. New
hall, chief of the reclamation service. ;
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 14. â C. E. Grun
sky of San Francisco, former Panama
canal commissioner and now consulting
engineer with the United States recla
mation service, arrived in Sacramento
to-day from a four months* tour of the
localities in which the Government has
begun irrigation projects. One of these
is in the northern part of Montana, and
negotiations are pending between a
Canadian canal company and the recla
mation service with reference to the
apportionment of the water.
Grunsky. said the reclamation service
has under consideration a project to
impound the waters of the Rio Grande
and regulate their flow. If the present
plans are carrjed out some arrangement
will have to be made with the Mexican
Government. The reclamation service
has also planned to utilize a large por
tion of the How of the Colorado River,
and the Secretary of the Interior Is now
considering acquired right both in the
United States and Mexico in connection
with the project.
Grunsky said he saw great possibili
ties In the proposed plant in the Klam
ath- Lake country. He said data are
being gathered now in connection with
the flow of the Sacramento River and
the possibilities for reclamation and ir
rigation in this valley. He remarked
that the general sentiment among, the
engineers Is that the funds at command
are too small for the great work in
prospect.
Previous to acting as commissioner
in these cases he was well known as
an attorney in Vermont.
After considering the arguments of
both governments in the case, Plumley
ruled in favor of Venezuela. The exact
aggregate of the claims presented was
$8,215,245; the total amount awarded to
five claimants $659,287. The largest
amount allowed by the referee was
$464,852, given to the Company General
of Orinoco on a claim of $1,469,907.
The decision of the referee was made
final by the terms of the protocol be
tween the two countries under which
they agreed to leave to the decision of
an umpire the contested claims.
Plumley was chosen, it is believed,
on account of his connection with the
British-Venezuelan and the Holland-
Venezuelan mixed commissions, which
sat in Caracas in 1903, in connection
with which opinions given by him are
said to have established two precedents
in international law.
The claims were for damages alleged
to have been sustained by French citi
zens conducting mercantile enterprises
In Venezuela during the insurrection of
1901. Plumley'sdcision is final.
The claims dismissed by Plumley for
want of equity were those of Fried
rich & Co. and the case of Thomas
Massinia: The former waa for 170,080
francs and that of Massinia for 20.7,813
francs.
The Venezuelan commissioner had al
ready rejected these claims and he was
supported in his contention by Referee
Plumley..
The claim disallowed, one of the
largest presented, was that of Anterne
Fabani for 9,509,728 francs. Venezuela
had declined to pay any part of the
claim.
Eight cases, involving claims of-40,
000,000 francs, against the Government
of Venezuela were submitted to Plum
ley. Of the eight cases two were dis
missed for want of equity and one was
disallowed.
NORTHFIELD, Vt, Aug. 14.â Claims
aggregating $659,287, held by the
French Government against Venezuela
have been allowed by Referee Frank
Plumley of this place, to whom they
had been referred for a decision and
final adjustment.
Plumley's decision was announced
here to-day to representatives of the
two governments, Count Perlte de la
Rocca and Dr. Jose de J. Paul.

TO rnoSECUTE LANDLORDS.
Twelve cases of yellow fever reported
near Pointe-a-la-Hache to-oay, in Plaque
mine Parish, are understood to be Italians
who left New Orleans in Uie middle of
the exritement following tbe discovery of
the nest of cases in the old French mar
ket quarter. Several hundred families at
that time sought refuge in Plaquemine.
Dr. Schayot, the health officer of Plaque
mine, has isolated the patients. The Ma
rine Hospital Service, it is announced to
day, will take charge of the work of re
moving filth and trash from streets and
houses, the intention being to put the
city in a sood sanitary condition.
Concerning the statement that druggists
have been prescribing for patients in or
der that families might avoid reporting
sickness to the authorities, Dr. White
to-day said that he would act toward
them, as he would toward physicians if he
learned that they were purposely conceal
ing cases. The doctors, themselves, how
ever, have indicated that they will hear
tily support any action designed to pro
hibit the practice among druggists of
treating yellow fever cases. The agita
tion over this matter grows out of a dis
covery on Saturday of the case of a
young woman of some prominence who
was found to be critically ill with yellow
fever without a doctor in charge. Only a
druggist had prescribed for her. Her
case proved fatal on Sunday, and to-day
a new case was reported in the same
house.
DnUGGISTS TREAT PATIEXTS.
Some infection has existed in scatter
ed quarters where local doctors have
resented the activity of Inspectors in
cases which they have themselves re
ported, but Dr. White Is displaying
great tact in handling the situation. Is
constantly smoothing out the wrinkles,
and hopes within a few days to have
co perfect a working system that cause
will no longer exist for dissatisfaction.

Canal Commission. Chairman Shonts
said:
WÂ« went to Colon with Mr. Stevens, the
chief engineer, to see what had been done and
what should be done. We found the first
thing of Importance to be housing- and supply-
Ing 20.000 men. When our Government first
took hold of the canal everythinK was di
rected toward making the dirt fly. I think
this was a mistake. Time should have b^en
given toward preparing for the task by mak
ing arrangements to take oarf of employes.
It Is true also that the laborers were not
promptly paid and that matters were becom
ing congested on the railway and steamers.
The people of the Isthmus are not forehanded
and with the large addition to the popula
tion caused by the Influx of the canal labor
ers, the supplies for living were exhausted.
This caused prices to rise and soon the la
boring class found that they could not earn
enough to support themselves. To offset this
sub-commissary stations were established to
teed the laborers.
I made an arrangement with the president
of Panama that unless prices became nor
mal on the Isthmus to continue this system of
supplying the laborers. At Colon a large re
frigerating plant is now being established, from
which all supplies will be Issued promptly, so
that shortly all American employes will be
able to obtain the same fare as they would
at home.
Of course, I found the freight congestion
causing considerable trouble, but soon found
that by supplying those practical up-to-date
railroad methods of the United States, that In
thirty days the trouble would be ellmlnaed.
There Is about COCK) tons on hand now. This
freight was ordered by the old commission to
be delivered at certain intervals. We hur
ried the matter up and urged prompt ship
ment, with the result that it all got to the
terminal coint at once.
As to double tracking the railroad, that
cannot be done at present, even if necessary,
but as the work of getting out the dirt
progresses, we can easily keep up with the
work with extra trackage. We have sup
plied refrigerating cars for the road.
There are about 10.000 employes on the
Isthmus now. including the laborers.

fend him. Charles Falrall. one of his
lawyers, said to-day: .
"The most important feature now is
the question of the law under which
these men are being prevented from
going' lnto the reserve. Congress has
failed to legislate upon the question of
reserves further than to give power to
certain ".Federal officers to create them
and' to adopt rules for their govern
ment. It-is- the contention of thÂ« sheep
men that the delegation of power by
Congress to executive officers, such as
the Bureau of Forestry, the Secretary
! of the Interior or the General Land Of-
I flee, to promulgate laws, the violation
of. which will constitute public of

MILL VALLEY TO HAVE
ATHLETICEXHTBITIOX
| REDWOOD CITY, Aug. U.â The
quarrel between the directors of. the
Italian Cemetery and the officers of the
Jewis-i- Cemetery over the alleged right
of the Italians to open for burial pur
poses eight acres of land acquired by
them near Colma has assumed the pro
portions of a spirited controversy be
fore the Board of Supervisors here. The
two burial associations have disagreed
over the use of Clark avenue, a thor
oughfare which separates the two cem
eteries involved. The Italians claim
that the Jewish association has erected
a fence across the street, closing it to
public , use, while, on the other hand,
the Italians are accused of having used
the street to inter bodies. ' -
Both sides waxed -warm In th* pre
sentation of their cause, but- when the
vote was taken by the Supervisors a
majority was In favor of denying- the
petition of the Italians unless they
agree to open Clark avenue for use as
a public thoroughfare. With defeat
staring them in the face, the Italians
were temporarily rescued by Super
visor Debenedetti, who changed his
vote and moved for a reconsideration.
In this way the matter will rest until
next Monday, when both aides will
again present their claims for consider
ation.

The gypsies have been warned by the

Pullman's horse, ran away with him
and, swerving, at the Borel place; threw
the young- millionaire and his compan

Pullman' iai' unconscious where he fell
until removed- to a private - hospital'
here, his Jaw severely injured : and his
scalp torn. ; lt was then feared that he
had sustained. either concussion of the
brain or fracture pf- the skull,' so he
was kept under close .observation. In
the evening, 'however,' his." companion
took him -to his residence at Belmont,
where he now lies.
The husband insists there were no
domestic troubles nor money difficulties
to worry his wife. She leaves two
children, a boy of 3 years and a girl 9
months old. Coroner Mehrmann was
notified to-day and will hold an in
quest. . .
For/ many months the despondent
woman had been ill and her failure to
recover^ health' had preyed much upon
her mind. According to her friends,
Mrs. Reed's mental disturbances ' had
caused her. to fret over trifles. She had
often declared she did not like life in
a country town. It 'was said that the
suicide of Rosie Lewis at Irvington
Saturday had preyed on the young
woman's mind and, possibly, had sug
gested the sudden deed of last night.
.Without v a 'word- of warning; the
young- wife quaffed half a tumblerful
of the deadly poison at 8:30 o'clock last
evening. She had barely swallowed
the fluid before her screams summoned
the startled husband. Quickly \u25a0 Dr.
Chalmers was called, but so much of
the stuff had been absorbed that Mrs.
lived only an hour.

years old, the wife of Edward Reed, a
plumber, committed suicide last night
at her home in Niles by drinking car
bolic acid.' ' ' ' \u25a0\u25a0* '
At the conclusion of the. proceedings
none of the Supervisors was willing to
say what he thought would be the out
come of the proceedings other than that
there certainly would have to be some
sort of a system of ' ordering supplies
and perhaps the appointment of an order
clerk. The bills for six months are before
the board: They amount' to" about $4000,
and have been cut down by. Expert Sabin
nearly $1000. Of this amount Assessor
Dalton's bills have been trimmed nearly
half. An effort has been ' made' to show
that furniture .that . Dalton purchased
through Otto L. Hasse. the manager of
the Central news store, -^as charged up
in his bills as stationery, arid that only
in some such way can he account for the
use of such quantities of material in his
office.
In reply ... to this Deputy County Clerk
George Pierce made a statement to the
effect that the County Clerk also sup
plies the five .courts, the Public Adminis
trator and in" all pine departments, and
that the County- Clerk's '-stationery bill
did not represent the amount used in
that office. . â¢ \u25a0 ...
Chairman Mitchell called the men to
order arid... said that personalities could
riot be allowed and' ordered tlie investiga
tion to proceed. .Deputy. District Attor
ney.. Wi H. ; L. Hynes then took up" the mat
ter! and calling 'upon Dalton 'as the first
witness asked him in regard to his bills
and their amounts and how he accounted
for their being as large as they were.' He
said that the only way he could account
for it was by comparing his bills with
those of the County Clerk, and said that
he employed more men, whereas, his bills
were less than the Clerk's.
CLERK'S OFFICE AFFAIRS. '
Tlie session started off briskly with
an interchange of . words between Su
pervisor Kowe and Assessor Henry P.
Dalton. The latter objected, to the pro
ceeding being considered an investiga
tion of him or his office. He stood by
his bills and said there was nothing
wrong with them so far as he knew,
notwithstanding that County Expert
John Sabin has- cut them down nearly
$500 for six months.
In reply Supervisor Rowe said: "I don't
want you to .try to make yourself, out the
great and good. man whom somebody else
is persecuting. You are : trying- in. that
sly, little cunning way. of yours to make
this pretense, ; and it don't go with me.

of the bills, and large amounts of sup
plies substituted where only small
quantities had â¢ been. ordered and re
ceived. . , \u25a0 :

IJnder Sheriff Hanjfin said he had
never ordered paste, by the* Quart nor
pencils by the gross, and had never had
a ball-pointed pen in his office, yet he
had been charged with large quantities
of these articles.
Assessor Dalton said he believed his
bills were, correct and that he had giv
en no authority to his chief deputy to
make any cuts in them. All the other
officers, however, said., they were cer
tain that they had not ordered or re
ceived any such amount of stationery
as had been charged up to them. Dep
uty Tax. Collector Hodges said. he had
never ordered Eutopian paste by the
dozon .quarts or Stafford ink. in the
same quantities, although he had been
charged, up ,with these, amounts. He
, had been charged with a dozen gross
of blotters but had never ordered more
.than two dozen at a time. Asked ,the
direct Question as. to. whether the bills
are in the samejeondition as when he
O. X.'d, he said that he believed that
they, were not that they had been
raised subsequently.

occasionally where she thinks it will do the

crawling into the engineer's cab, saw the
body hanging from the edge of the win

] btve knonn Sir Walter Scott since my
l-ijhood days.. In my earliest youth I road
f-r.d reread with satisfaction and education the
irurkz ol Scott. 'He is the only man in the
kirgdom of Great Britain and Ireland who
Â«"lab!ls^ed a whole form of literature in his
lamous historical novels. In a decade aftrr
tht. death of Scott, his historical works were
;n th^ process of translation in the various
ci.ur.tri;-s ot the glubp. His works hav<! be
comA standard In all parts of the world. In
t::- littlr kingdom of Holland and in Portugal
St. Andrew's Society celebrated the one
hundred and thirty-fourth anniversary of
the birth of Sir Walter Scott at Scottish
Hall last r.ijrht. The attendance was
large and an interesting programme of
things Scotchâ songs, recitations and ad
rirtssesâwas enjoyed.
Professor H. Morse Stephens of the
Tniversity of California delivered an ad
dress on the life of Sir Walter Scott. Pro
fesfcor Stephens' address, in part, was as
follows:
his works mci v.iih rrc-at general favor ajid
have undoubtedly spurnM on many writers in
oih^r dimes to the <-ompi.atlO7i of his historical
events '.n the forms of historical novels. With
ail of the men who have attempted to com
plete works in Scott's inimtcabie style, none
have approached his sympathetic Imaginative
v.i'.tir^.
â¢When 1 read the modern historical novel I
Olwaya lfturn to Scctt to gain acquaintance
with real historical fiction. The present novete
\u25a0re dressed up in a manner mat pay* undue
attention to the dress of the characters. The
fic-Ã¼blft and hose, the wig and relics of his
torical past do nut make up a historical novel.
Character* are cepicted in outlandish clcth-s.
Sc-ctt crerlbcked the clothes and brought into
existeruf a new form of literature. It was his
sympathetic imagination that enabled him to
[â¢reduce the tvents of the past. Scott worked
into hir stories an actual general atmosphere
of the people- and their country. He couldn't
liavf explained the history ot the past hau
h<- not given his writings that general atmos
phere. Sir Walter Scott was a genius. He
trade Scottish history that will live forever.
He was a senius ard a man of whom all
Scctiand fhould be proud to ray, "He was a
Set."
Preceding; Professor Stephens' address.
President T. C. I.awson of St. Andrew's
Society delivered the opening remarks.

Then, continuing: *>Aboi;t a week after
the time I caught Mrs. Taggart and For
tesque coming uy out of the cellar For
tesque came home with some young la
dies and I immediately ordered him from
my house."
In regard to . Mrs. Taggart's taking
the children from the hotel in San
Francisco across the bay to San Ra
fael, leaving; word not to inform Tag
gart of her whereabouts, the defense
attempted to show that on an occasion
previous to this Taggart had abducted
the children and only returned them on
habeas corpus proceedings, but Tag
gart denied that he returned the chil
dren in obedience to such a writ.
Taking up the abduction of the chil
dren, the major said, in answer to
questions, that upon information in re
gard to Mrs. Tacgart's conduct in San
Francisco, furnished him by Mrs. Pres
ton, he took the children and came to
Wooster. Asked about letters receiv
ed in regard to the Rither affair at
Fort Thomas, witness stated that he
did not remember the exact language
in the letter, but; it was to the effect
that "I had better watch my wife and
Captain Rither. as they were patron
izing a bad house in Newport." *
The pledge of Major Taggart. the
signing of which gained him his free
dom from prison at Fort Leavenworth.
was read just before the adjournment
for the day. and in reply to a question
the witness said:
-I do not think that is the paper I
signed."
j in this pledge Taggart agreed to re
sign from the army if he ever again
wrongfully accused his wife.
The pledge read as follows:
N "I, E. IV. Tagrsart, do hereby promise
my commanding officer to abstain from
the use uf all intoxicating liquors while
I am an officer in thÂ« United States
army. I. promise never again to wrong
fully accuse my wife of wrongdoing. I
writ* this of my own free will and
without mental reservation, and write
this as my resignation from tho army
to be forwarded to headquarters as mi
resignation whenever in the opinion of
my commanding officer I shall have
violated this pledge."
Witness said that one n!ght he caught
Mrs. Taggart and Lieutenant Fcrtesque
coming out of the cellar.
In reply to a question as to his ability
to set drunk the witness said: "My ca
pacity for beer is so large that I could not
drink enough to make me drunk. I never
tested my capacity for drinking whisky
or cocktails."
"When you saw this little womah going
to bed because of drinking why didn't you
kick every bottle of liquor and every in
gredient of cocktail out of the house?"
asked Smyser. ;
"B- cause," answered Taggart, "I
thought there were other ways of .accom
plishing the same ic-sulls."
' Asktd about the beer drinking contest
at Fort Thomas, witness said that at one
time he was in charge uf the canteen, but
not Â«t the time of the contest.
Major Taggart admitted that Mrs. Tag
gart playti. the organ for Chaplain
Springer at Fort Thomas at the Sunday
exercises while he remained at home to
care for the children. He stated that his
drinking habits at Fort ' I^eavenworth
were no worse than they had . always
been. f v'*'.~
WOOSTER, Ohio, Aug. 14.â The testi
mony in the cross-examination of Major
Taggart to-day . was interspersed with
brilliant repartee ua thÂ« part of Attorney
Smyser and the witness, in which Tag
gait seveia! times floored Smyaer, â¢ al
though the latter succeeded in wringing
some admissions from the witness that
were adverse to his case. -. .
Commissioner Yerkes not dis
cuss the matter. Those in position to
know say that Commissioner Yerkes
had personally been watching the work
of tho revenue agents, who are rcallj"
the secret investigating- officials of the
revenue bureau, and has concluded that
tome of them had not been doins: their
duty in detecting 1 some of the things
j^oins; on.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 14. â There has
been a big shake-up among the revenue
aarents of the Internal Revenue Service,
but just how far it has gone is a- mat
ter of speculation. It is stated, how
ever, that four well-known revenue
agents have been asked for their resig
nations and that at least two of the
four have come here for a conference
with Commissioner Yerkes of tho In
ternal Revenue Bureau. These are
Captain Charles H. Ingrain,' in charge
of New Kngland work, stationed at
HoEton. and C. H. Burg, who has been
ill 'charge of a section of the South
west and has been located in Texas.
The names of the other two agents
could not be learned "to-day.

As sood in her way is Miss Helen
Lowell as Miss Hazy, the psssimist. an
exquisitely humorous conception. Miss
Helen Raymond, who is lost out of the
Chutes as a foil for Annie Redline. is
six feet up and one across of fun as
Mrs. Eichorn. and Anna Fields measures
as much the other way as Mrs. Schultz.
Charles Carter is e-litt?ringly funny as
Mr. Stubblns: Bessie Barriscale. prettiest
of ingenues as Lovey Mary, and Argyle
Campbell a delightful Billy Wiggs. But
everybody fits into his and her part and
the play goes bravely.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
I should like a column to give to Mrs.
Madge Carr Cook's admirable portrait of
Mrs. Wiggs, the sunny, slatternly phil
osopher of the cabbage patch. I am
going to see Mrs. Cook to-day and can
not imagine showing up without taking
her something: to "make over" for
"Asia." I rather hope she will have
clar'd up, but I shan't mind if she
hasn't, and she doesn't, bless you. if
she can only "stride over it." In
one cannot imagine Mrs. Cook apart from
Mrs. Wiggs. Of course, it is good art,
a keen, shrewd, sympathetic art. but ons
does not think of that until afterward.
It is of the best "character" work ever
done here.
"A three-aci classic character comedy
with heart and home interest," the pro
gramme labels the play, ami it is a gnod
label. No more than in the book from
which the play is made is there much
of a plot, but there is fun and sen^e,
broad humanity, v.it and wisdom and
an all-round appeal in "'â¢Mrs. Wiggs."
Granted that Mrs. Schultz and Mrs.
Eichorn are figure:; more caricatures than
charactersâ so are the .Mr?. Schultzes
and Mrs. Eichorns of life: granted
that some of the coincidences are too
lifelike to be plausible, 'and many other
things grant; yet "Mrs. Wiggs of the
Cabbage Patch" will be enjoyed by any
and every one.
"Never put uo your umbrella until it
rains." says Mrs. Wiggsâ and don't put
oft until to-morrow seeing "Mrs. Wiggs
of the Cabbage Patch" say I. The play
is at the Columbia this week, and acted
to its limit. Last night its quaint, homely
humor kept the largest first night house
of the season on the broad grin through
out, a sweet, toothrome laugh that began
at one's toes and tingled up to one's
topknot and stayed there. Mrs. Wiggs. in
her habit as she lived. Miss Hazy. Mr.
Stubbing. Mrs. Schultz. Mrs. Elctiorn.
Asia, Australia, Euro:>enaâ all tho rest
of them seem to hav^s walked in bodily
from the book.

V \u25a0 \ \u25a0 \u25a0 gyout the girl toils,
and she is often the bread-winner of
the family. Whether she is sick or
well, whether it rains or shines, she
must get to her place of employment,
perform the duties exacted of herâ
smile and be agreeable.
Among- this class the Bymptoms of
female diseases are early manifest by
weak and aching backs, paia in the
lower limbs and lower p3rt of the
stomach. In consequence of frequent
wetting of the feet, monthly periods
become painful and irregular, and fre-
quently there are faint and dizzy spells,
with loss of appetite, until life is a
burden. All of these symptoms point
to a derangement of the female organ-
ism which can' be easily and promptly
cured by Lydia E. Pickham's Vegeta-
ble Compound.
Miss Abby F. Barrows, Nelsonville,
Athens Co.. Ohio, tells what this great
medicine din for her. She writes :
Dear Mrs. Pinkham:â
"I f(Â»o] it my duty to tell you the good

'â¢Your rnÂ«liÂ«ine has made me well and
strong. I eaÂ» do irost any kind of work
\u25a0without complaint, and my periods are all
right. ?'t i'-V
"I am in better health than I ever was,
end I know it is all due to your remedies. I
rccom^ie^d your advice and medicine to all
who suffer."
It is to such girls that Mrs. Pink-
ham holds out a helping hand and ex-
tends a cordial invitation to correspond
with her. Her long record of success
in treating woman's ills makes her let-
ters of advice of untold value to every
ailin"" working girl, and from her wide
exnerience and skill she quickly points
the way to health. Her advice is free,
and all letters are held by her ia
the strictest confidence. Address, Mrs.
Pinkhaxn, Lye a, Mass.

There is a settlement promised In tha
matter of the checks. The man involved
is prominent enough to have the book
makers welcome paper bearing his name.
He lost, and gave checks on a city that
has not many representatives. The book
makers discovered to-day that these
checks had not been honored. After a
lot of telegraphing word: was received
that they would be made good by his
wife.
SARATOGA, Aug. 14.â There i 3 much
gossip in circulation in the cafe of the
Saratoga Club and on the hotel piazzas
this evening. The main topic has been
the report that certain checks given to a
bookmaker by a loser at the track have
r.ot been made good. Added to this is the
etory that the Chicago plungers met their
Waterloo at the track and that a legisla
tive junketing committee has stopped off
at Saratoga in search of facts about for
estry.
It is said Jeffries offered more than $40,000
for the property or agreed to lease Jt at
double the rental Baldwin ia setting. Baldwin
is holding out for more money. If the deal
fails Jeffries proposes to build a hotel of his
own at some place not yet selected by him.
The Oakwood is a small hotel, but It la
considered one of the beet properties In the
tourist line. It has the reputation of being
a Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde house, with amiable
orange picking Boston school teachers In the
daytime and gay parties of society sports oÂ£
an evening. There have been many gay
throngs at the house and in former years
Baldwin frequently took there scores of horse
men and others for Indefinite stays.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 14. â James J. Jef
fries is ambitious to become a hotel keeper.
When he left the ring he announced he had
abandoned the vocation of beating men in
the floating ribs and clouting them on the
jaw for some more quiet and less notorious
calling. He has made Lucky Baldwin an
offer for the Oakwood Hotel at Arcadia. If
he gets It Jim and his wife will go there to
live and will run the hotel. It is understood
that so far Lucky has refused the offer. \u25a0 The

HAS NARROW ESCAPE.â John Covaccio
vich accidentally turned on the gas in his
room at 624 Kearny street. The landlady de
tected \u25a0 thÂ» odor and C<rÂ»acclovlch was rescued
none too soon.
Definite word has been received that all of
the crack tennis players of Southern Califor
nia will comoete In the coast championship
tournaments at San Rafael next month. There
was considerable doubt as to whether any of
the men from the south would make the trip
this year. It was not expected Ex-Champion
Bell would comp*te, but it U definitely knowa
he will be In all of the events next month.
Archie Way and Simpson Sinsabaush have
also expressed their Intention, to come north.
It is expected Hal Braley. EuK-ne Overton
and ona or two other experts will also be on
hand.
Miss May Sutton, champion of the world,
will return In time to defend her title to the
championship of the coast. Ths littl? cham
pion of champions will be the stellar attrac
tion and will meet a player In the challenge
match who will bring out her best game. Miss
May's three clever sisters wtll be seen on thÂ«
courts at San Rafael this year and also sev
eral other fair experts from the south. They
are: Miss Gabriel Dobbins, Mrs. Seymour,
Miss Seymour. Miss Eleanor P*ralto and MisÂ»
E, Ryan. Miss Dobbins Â»nd the Seymours
have played at San Rafael in ths past, and
while they hardly class with the Suttons they
are several classes higher than any of the
players in this district.
The presence of these clever players at San
Rafael next month Insures a successful meet.
There is a scarcity of class among- the hornÂ«
; playern at present and with no outsiders in
the coast championship events they would
have provtd the most uninteresting ever held.
Bell should be In better shape this year than
he was last year when he lltejally stepped
from the train to the tennis court. A five
days' trip across the country did not leave him
In the best of shapÂ« and certainly affected his
chances In the challenge match. He won the
doubles championship of Southern California
recently with the vet-ran Archi* Way for a
partner. The latter is a man about 50 yearn
of ase. but Is as good a doubles player aa there
Is in the game. " HÂ« and Bell will play to
gether at San Rafa-1 and they will be the j
team to beat. ,
Miss Violet Sutton and Simpson Slnsabau&h.
thÂ« mixed doubles champtons of Southern Call- '
fornia, will be one of the strongest teams In '
that event at San Rafael.
While It Is more than liktly Uw honors win
go south this year the enthusiasts her* will
surely be glad to learn that the southern con
tingent will be with us again. They arÂ« the
best sports in the world and ar? all graceful
losers. Another reason for rejoicing Is that
it will rive State Champion Fred Adams a
chance to go up against some real talent. Since
his jump to the top Adams has b*en beating
all of thÂ» experts tn this city about as he
pleased. He Is playing a remarkably good
game and would undeniably have a chance
against Bell. The latter Is one of the great
est net . players ever on this coast . and a
playsr of this description Adams has not gone
up'asaicst yet. If Bell la as clever as tn
other years Ms speedy net game will prob- I
ably break up the fast hack court gam* or j
Adams. The latter â¢will surely be the strong- I
eÂ«t city player In the tournament, and tf the [
singles championship remains In the north I
Adams will be the man to bold the title for |
the coming year.
Southern California Will Send Her
Strongest Player* Next Month.

Hay yesterday in thirty-three mlnutea. The

recorded by competent Judges, is believed to

Australia has covered the distance in twenty

CHICAGO, Aug. 14.â There is good
reason to believe that the peaceful con
ditions which have so long prevailed- in
the baseball world are to be broken up.
Trouble will probably date from the
meeting: of the National Committee to
morrow in Cincinnati. President B. B.
Johnson of the American League, before
leaving Cincinnati to-night, expressed the
belief that a split between the major and
the minor leagues is inevitable and John
son ought to know.
Johnson is after the little fellows hard
er than anybody else and he says the
ultimatum of the National Committee is
sued at Cleveland last month will be ob
served to the letter. According to the
American League executive there is to
be no crawfishing by the committee. All
of which means, in few words, that the
protection of the national agreement is
to be withdrawn from the minor leagues.
The big league magnates will then be at
liberty to raid the small leagues and
take whatever players they can get at
any time and in any way.

The high schools, are again In ses
sion and already the captains of thÂ«
various football elevens in the metro
politan district are hacd at work In an
endeavor to find likely material. Evpry
school has lost some of Its stars. Inter
est at present centers chiefly in the ma
terial on hand and In the likely can
didates from the 1/icoming 190 D clasa.
Lick School seems to be the chief
snfferer from graduation. Five of th*
champion football team of 1904 am
gone. Fred Moullln, the best athleto
Lick ever had. goes to the University
of Oregon. "Heinle" Snell. fullback;
Marius Hotchkiss. center; "Chick"
O'Connor, end; and "Brick" "Whit*.
tackle, all of the championship team.
will be claimed by University of Cali
fornia. Just who Is to kick the ball.
now that Moullln has gone. Is a harl
thing to say. The honor will probabl;-
rest with some member of the new
class.
Polytechnic will also feel the loss of
their graduates. Out of the team
which was the only one to give Lick x.
rub last year, "Poly" will lose Bonlneld,
Govel. Lowe. Reardon, Anderson and
probably McKenzie. The latter con
templates going to Santa Clara, but iff
he remains In the city he will be seen
wearing the black and red colors. A
captain for the team has hot been
elected, but the honor will bÂ« between
Saunders and Garibaldi.
Lowell loses only Cedrio Cerf of last
year's team, but a more valuable man
could not be found than Cerf. He was
practically the backbone of tnÂ© team
and his absence will be keenly felt.
With almost a full team and better men
coming in perhaps, Lowell ought to b*Â»
a hard team to beat. Roncovieri has the
captaincy for this season.
Downing Peeler and Tretton are thÂ«
only survivors of Mission's team, but
with a freshman clasa of a hundred
and fifty to pick from, a good team
should be gathered.

The Sutton family Is especially pleased
over the receipt of some verses which
were mailed by some unknown friends of
the family from Wimbledon, where Miss
May won the English championship from
Miss Kate Douglass. The verses are en
titled "Lawn Tennis at Badminton." and
the writer says they are "a parody on the
popular song. 'Maud, Maud, Maud,' "
which the English are alleged to be sing
ing strenuously. These are the words:
There is a lady from over the way.
From the West of the great U. S. A.
Drive, volley and service
With puzzling: curve is
To her but the merest child's play;
The name of this lady is May;
She studied out West, so they say;
Some wish they could slaughter
The tutor that taueht her
Such quite Irresistible play!
O May. May! May! May!
The girl from the greet U. S. A!
She makes the -white "slazens^rs"
Lightning passengers â
Slaves that her will must obey!
With a muscular force
That outrivals the horse
And the dash of a light coryphee â
She aspires, like her nation.
To lick all creation.
Does May, May, May!
So great is the splash she has ma<sÂ«
That the Ciar has requested her aid;
So the mutinous rover
Potemklne cave over
And Unevitch ventured a raid!
Why look at the Wimbledon stand!
It was hit by a drive from her hand â
Not a stick 's now remaining.
And Palmer's complaining
Miss Sutton costs more than the band!
O May, May. May
The girl from the great V. S. A..
They say that Doherty
Is getting quite shorty
At seeing some one else make hay!
She mocks at the sun.
And until she has won.
The thunder keeps out of the way;
For its volts ere a joke
When compared with the Â«trokÂ»
Of May. May. May!
Arrangements are being made In Pasa
dena to have a public reception tendered
the champion of them all when she re
turns here. The Board of Trade has tak
en up the matter In deference to the pub
lic interest, and it is proposed to have
one of the large tourist hotelsâ probably
the Marylandâ turned into a great con
servatory of flowers and musio on that
occasion.
Captain Sutton says his daughter May
will enter the San Rafael tournament to
defend her title to the coast champion
ship, "And then." says the captain and
proud father, "she Is coming straight
home."
According to Captain Sutton, the ten
nis wonder will play in the trl-State
tournament at Cincinnati on the 28th
Inst. She will leave Immediately there
after for San Francisco. She will be met
in the northern metropolis by her mother
and her three sisters, who are also tennl3
players and former championsâ Miss
Violet Sutton, Miss Florence Sutton and
Mrs. B. O. Bruce. Miss Violet recently
won thÂ« championship of Southern Cali
fornia from her slser. Miss Florence,
thus demonstrating the truth of the say
ing that "It takes a Sutton to beat a
Sutton."
PASADENA, Aug. 14.â Miss May Sut
ton, the clever youns woman champion
tennis player of the world, whose home
is in this city, will return here early
in September, notwithstanding many re
ports to the contrary. This statement
was made to-day to The Call correspon
dent by Captain A. de G. Button, father
of the young lady, when seen at hla
picturesque family residence on the out
skirts of Pasadena.

Fort Erie to-day over a track that was
lightning fast. The feature of the card
was the mile event in which Rebo, Bon
nie Sue and Henry Waite came togeth
er. Rebo was the favorite, Bonnie Sue
second choice and Henry Waite third
choice. Rebo never left the result in
doubt from the beginning, leading all
the way and winning in a romp. Henry
Waite caught Bonnie Sue, tiring from a
futile effort to catch the leader and
beat her a head for the place. The mile
was run in 1:40. Summary:

CINCINNATI, Aug. 14.â Five favor
ites, three of them at odds-on, won to
day at Latonia. The track Â»was a sea
of mud. The handicap steeplechase,
feature of the card, was won handily
by Lights Out.
Out of five mounts Jockey Radtke,
who was thrown from a horse and In
jured on Saturday, rode three winners,
a second horse and was unplaced once.
With the arrival of Starter Jake
Holtman at the track, all sorts of ru
mors were started, but nothing definite
could be gleaned from him as to his
visit here. There is talk of an official
starter on the American Turf Associ
ation tracks, as on the Jockey Club
tracks in the East. Holtman was seen
talking to several leading officials
of the association during the racing.

Game Between the Senators
and Cleveland Reaches the
Thirteen - Inning Stage
Nelson is als-j due from Truckee to
morrow. He will commence his training
immediately at Larkspur, where he haa
\u25a0worked for all his fights.
A suggestion has been made that the
fight be held on Labor day. It is thought
the labor organizations would object
strongly to this, as it might Interfere
with their plans for that day. As a pa
vilion must be built by members of the
union*, they have an effective method of
retaliation should they want to use it.
Manager Coffroth announced yesterday
that all cameras found in the possession
of spectators at the fight would be con
fiscated. This bars both the omnipresent
newspaper artists and the amateurs. The
precaution is taken to protect the mov
ing picture concession, for which a large
amount is expected. Steps will also be
taken to prevent an Eastern concern
v-hich makes up moving pictures from
models from doing so In this instance.
Jimmy Britt will leave Lake Tahoe to
ripht and is due here to-morrow morn
ing. He will probably do some work at
the Olympic Club to-morrow. On the fol
lowing day he will settle down in train
ing quarters at Sheehan's Beach Tavern,
Representing the Native Sons were
Grand President James Gallagher. W. D.
Hynes. O. W. Boxton and Senator J. H.
ICeison. The conference was entirely in
i< rmal. President Gallagher said the
committee had planned a big celebration
at Sacramento, and it was feit the light
would detract from the attendance. It
was also pointed out that the celebration
vould detract from the attendance at the
XighL As it is impossible to stop the cel
ebration at Sacramento they asked that
the date of the fight be changed.
Manager Coffroth replied that he was
under heavy expense and that he could
r.ot give an answer offhand. He prom
lj-c-d to do so before the next meeting of
the general committee on Saturday.
Unintentionally the Native Sons have
given the nght an advertisement it would
r.ot otherwise have received. It is on the
tame principle as that of a book excluded
from the shelves of a library, which la
thus brought strongly into public view.
While the officials would not acknowl
edge it for the world, there is a suspicion
that many who must appear at Sacra
mento because of their official positions
would also like to attend the fight.
The sub-committee appointed by the
Joint 9th of September celebration com
xrtiuee of the Native Sons to secure if
possible the postponement of the Britt
>.'elson fight, scheduled for that day, dis
cussed the matter informally yesterday
â¢v.ith Manager Jim Coffroth. The latter
took it under advisement.

The card waa not of much class, still
some of the races were interesting.
Bauble won the. Kentucky stakes after
a drive with Watergrass. The latter
and Hester TV made the running. Hes

tergrass weakened later on sufficiently
to let up Bauble. Flavigny saved a lot
of ground on the turn and took third
money. Lady Navarre was probably
the best in the race. She received a

CATAM2H
A UNIVERSAL DISEASE
Catarrh usually begins with a cold in
the head, but does not stop there. The
mucous membranes all become inflamed
and secrete a filthy, unhealthy matter
which is absorbed by the blood and dis-
tributed to all parts of the body. The .
patient is then continually hawking
and spitting, the nose is stopped up,
the ears have a ringing or buzzing noise,
the throat becomes sore, and as the un-
healthy matter more thoroughly satu-
rates the blood a general feeling of des-
pondency takes possession of the system.
I had Catarrh for about fifteen years,
and no man could have been, worse. I
tried everything I could hear of. but no
good resulted. I then bes-an S. S. S.,
and could see a littla improvement frora
the first bottle, and after tailing- it a
short while was cured. This was sis
years a?o. and I am as well today as any
man. I think Catarrh is a blood dis-
ease, and know there is nothing- on earth
better for the blood than S. S. S. No-
body thinks more of S. S. S. than I do.
Lapeer, ilich. M. MATSON.
Local applications cannot cure Catarrh,
because they do not reach the seat of the
trouble. They allay the inflammation
and temporarily relieve the disease, but
as soon as they are left off the trouble re-
turns. The only way to cure Catarrh is
to treat it through the blood. S. S. S. soon
clears the blood of all Catarrhal matter and
purges it of alHrritating poisons, checks
further progress of the trouble and com-
pletely cures the disease. S. S. S. keeps
the blood in per-
S/g^S.'a *fSSiJ fcctordersothat
from the system

this great vegetable remedy in the cure
of this disease. Write for our book and

9nSWS OF THE OCEA.V.
The commission has become impressed
with the^ danger attending the operating
of freight trains on which an insufficient
number of cars are equipped with air
brakes, operated by the engineer.
Recent accidents involving loss of life
and property, caused, by the "buckling"
of freight trains â the rear cars crowding
forward upon those in frontâ when emer
gency applications of air have been made
on trains partially airbraked, have dem
onstrated that such trains are not actu
ally under the control of the engineer, as
required by law. As the impact which
causes "buckling" is due to the presence
of unbraked cars in the rear of the train,
it appears to the commission that such
accidents may be obviated by requiring a
number of cars in trains greater than the
60 per cent now required by law to have
their brakes operated by the engineer. In
crease in the minimum is authorized by
law. It is added that the evident purpose
of the law Is to ultimately require the use
of airbrakes on all cars of all freight
trains. - : ? ::5
WASHINGTON, Aug. 14.â The Inter
state Commerce Commission is about to
take steps to require all railroads en

"So, at the last moment, water was
used. The matter was kept secret until
the christening was over.
"You remember that when the Ken
tucky was launched water was used for
christening by the sponsor, but as the
ship slid down the ways persons in the
crowd shattered flasks of whisky against
her sides, literally bathing her in liquor.
I did not want that to happen in the case
of the Kansas and now believe she was
the only ship which has been launched in
the navy that was launched without be
ing sprinkled with wine or liquor." \u25a0
Governor Hoch criticized District Attor
ney Jerome for his speeches in Kansas
and said Kansas had no need of "cigar
ette philosophy."
I WASHINGTON, Aug. 14.â Governor
Hoch of Kansas and his staff arrived in
Washington to-day from Camden, where,
last week, was launched the battleship
Kansas. He tells why his daughter shat
tered a bottle of -water on the armored
prow of the battleship instead of using
the traditional bottle of wine. Governor
Hoch said:
"For twenty-four years Kansas has
been a prohibition State. â¢ Prohibition is
no longer an issueâ it is the general sen
timent. To christen the battleship Kan
sas with wine seemed to me an absolute
violation of that sentiment. Before I left
Kansas a' delegation of prominent Kan
sans waited upon me with a bottle of wa
ter from John Brown's spring, in Lynn
County. They requested that It be used.
I accepted it. < t
"Subsequently I saw Governor Mickey
of Nebraska and told him of my dilemma.
He told me'he had desired to use water
in christening the battleship Nebraska,
but the builders at Seattle objected. I
said nothing, but put the "bottle of water
into my valise, and nearly twenty-four
persons of my party knew of it.
"When I arrived at the ship yard at
Camden I took aside the representative
of the company and explained to him
that, while I was a prohibitionist, it made
no difference to me whether or not a bot
tle of wine was broken on the ship. I
told him that I would rather see it used
that way than poured down the throats
of men. Politically, I informed him, I felt
that water should be used, because of the
sentiment in my State. He said:
" 'That is all right^'

thought we'd like to write â Just for

Shall Not Ring To-night." â Chicago
Journal.
*~pÂ»HE people who get their learning in Chicago University are
1 favored with more new theories, ideas taken out of the oven
"*\u25a0 untimely, and odd counsel on all subjects, than students of any
other college in the country. Mr. Rockefeller has, in that univer
sity, endowed an institution in which originality seems to be sought
at all hazards. The students have been lectured on the wav of a
man with a maid, going further than Solomon in his wisdom, who
said it was a way that could not be traced nor tracked nor foretold.
They have also listened to learned discourses on making money, in
which the rich of to-day were likened to Shakespeare in the form
and order of their genius, only he shunted into dramatic literature
while the}' expend their genius in getting millions.
Now comes a professor who tells the same students that man
is a barbarian just in proportion to the hand that women have in
his rearing and training. Given a man wjiose infant cradle and
first steps were watched and guarded by a woman, and whose
schooling and first lessons in conduct were by the eternal feminine,
and you have a barbarian, from the cradle to the grave, according
to this learned authority. As token of good faith he offered him
self in evidence, but at that point the wires grew twaddle-tired, and
we are left in the dark as to whether he was reared by a woman
and is therefore a Jbarbarian, or by a man and therefore is a civil
ized gentleman. As for us we think that whoever reared and
trained him should be ashamed of the job. His statement seems to
be aimed at women students and teachers. We suspect that he
was reared by a man, fed on pickles, given a file to gnaw, and he iÂ«
at it yet. ,

REFLECTIONS OF A BACHELOR.
A grirl has to be mighty pretty not to be as ugly as her rival says she is.
The following was a favorite story of
my grandmother's:
She said thnt when she was young her
home was on a large plantationâ it was
slavery times thenâ three miles from the
old town of Cahaba, Alabama, and that
a short distance from there, down on
what was then called Black Creek, there
lived a worthy old couple generally
known as Aunt Pattie and Uncle Sam.
One day the old woman was sent for
to sit up with an ill child.
On her return next morning she could
find -no trace of her husband, and when
she blew the old horn in vainâ a sum
mons to which he always promptly re
spondedâshe immediately decide.d that he
had been drowned in the creek, and so
gave the alarm.
Being Sunday, the men were all at
home, so she soon had ciulte a crowd
around her. all excited over the news and
eager to assist in the quest. Hastening
down to the creek, accompanied by Aunt
Pattie, who insisted on going, they went
to work.
The search went on for some time, the
old woman, standing with arms a-ltimko,
watching proceedings with great inter
est.
At last they found the poor old man,
and, drawing him out of the water, the
men were horritied to see the body cov
ered with eels. :.-', l .'
Aunt Pattie, with an exclamation of
astonishment, strode forward, and, wav
ing the men off. went vigorously to
work to dislodge the slimy little fish,
carefully depositing each one In a rusty
tin bucket. \u25a0 â¢ . .. '
Finally, when the last one was removed
and the men again advanced to her as
sistance, she arose and cried out:
"Stop, boys, stop! Let's set him
ag'in."â Lipplncott's.
SET HIM AGIN.
WHILE the details of the settlement offered by Japan, as
given in the news dispatches, are largely speculative, their
form may be fairly deduced from the nature of the situation.
The money indemnity is the trading clement in Japan's proposition.
Given Sa^halien,' the railroad, suppression of Russian influence. in
-Manchuria, and the suzerainty of Korea, the predominance of
Japan in the affairs of Eastern' Asia follows as a matter of course.
And why not? it is the same predominance that we claim in this
hemisphere, by the Monroe doctrine.
At the time we claimed it we were not as well able to make
The claim good as Japan is now. But it happened that there was
community of interest between the United States and Great Britain.
English statesmen desired to impair the imperial position of Spain,
which the Holy Alliance sought to restore by aiding her in the re
covery of her American possessions. If this had succeeded Spain
would have again become a menace to Great Britain, as she was
in the time of Phillip the Second. Russia holds in the East the
same position that Spain held in this hemisphere, and her attempt
to a&sert it was a menace not only to Japan but to the interests of
Great Britain throughout Asia.
If japan secure her position in asserting a new Monroe doc
trine for Eastern Asia, the effect upon her economic interests will
be more permanent and important than the receipt of a large money
indemnity. Japanese industry and enterprise, wrought upon the
opportunities she will share with the world in China and her suze
rainty of Korea, will enable her to carry with comfort the expenses
of the war.
Her progress in the future will be much like ours and her po
sition in Asia will be far stronger than the position of Great Britain
in Europe. Such a settlement will promote the rapid rise of China
to an equality among the nations, with an expansion of the wants
of her people % and a multiplication of commercial exchanges, profit
able to the mercantile world.
If, on the other hand, Japan take a large money indemnity,
equal to the cost of the war, she will start with a clean sheet, with
a navy recruited and made stronger by the ships captured from
Russia, and the absolute control of the coast by primacy on the
seas. With peace made under such conditions, without guarantee
of its permanence, she will be prepared to strike Russia upon the
first appearance of a renewal of an aggressive policy. This would
be hardly peace at all. It would more resemble an armed truce, like
that of the nations of Europe.
It would be a truce, too, in which China would be imitating
the example of Japan, so that when war came again the two em
pires would combine their forces. Such a combination, with China
as prepared as Japan, would leave no doubt of the result. The
world does not desire such a situation, nor, it ma}' well be believed,
does Japan desire it. Heretofore in her social system and. polity
commerce has been at the foot of the list. The soldier, sailor and
agriculturist have been at the head. But Japan has no industrial
future now divorced from commerce. Her assimilation of the
best of Western civilization puts her of necessity in the family of
commercial nations, and in that respect she will become to Asia what
England is to Europe.
In making peace this consideration will probably weigh the
heaviest with her statesmen. It is well that it should. If back
ward in commerce, she would be subject to exploitation by the com
mercial nations as China has been. If independent, she becomes a
factor and a beneficiary in the trade of the world. Her imports
have more than doubled since 1895, and her exports have sextupled
in the same period, in her trade with the United States alone. This
year's trade will show a vast increase in her imports from this
country. It is interesting that our trade with Japan for the fiscal
year 1903-4 was more than double our trade with European Russia.
That is a significant showing for a country that emerged from
seclusion only about fifty years ago. It is a distinct encouragement
to this country to promote a peace that will be in the interest of
the permanent commercial expansion of Japan. It is also a-signi
ficant index to what may come in China, when that empire is in
spired by the example of Japan. It will be seen then that this coast
has a conspicuous interest in the negotiations at Portsmouth. We
may turn the subject and examine all of its sides, with the inevitable
conclusion that commercially Eastern Asia is to be to the trade
of this coast what Europe is to the Atlantic seaboard. Without
Eastern Asia our commercial future has no significant existence.
Xo doubt the peace negotiations will be prolonged, but there
is no present ground for pessimism as to the result. It will be
peace, and that peace should have the element of permanence. It
should endure in order that economic laws may work their way
unhindered by other ambitions and schemes of aggrandizement.

<<wES." said the Good Mamma to the
J Afternoon Caller, "I had to shut
"Willie up for a time. He is form
ing a bad habit of deceiving me, and
this afternoon I actually caught him
in aâla â I shudder to say it. but It really
was a â lie. So I shut him up both as
a punishment and in order to give him
an opportunity to think of his sin."
"So shocking!" murmured the After
noon Caller. *'but I should not worry
about it if I were in your place. Most
children go through such a stage at
some period In their youthful careers,
but they get over it. I 'suppose it is
merely an expression of original sin."
"Oh. you dear thing, you are so com
forting! But I might have known it.
You always are so sweet and sympa
thetic. What, must you really go? I
am so sorry. I do hope you will come
again very soon. It seems so long be
tween your precious calls. Well, good
by, dear. Be sure that you do not stay
away so loner the next time."
"There!" said the Good Mamma to
herself, after the Afternoon Caller had
departed, "that odious creature has
gone, and I shall not be afflicted by her
again for some time to come. Now I
guess I may as well let Willie out. I
think he must realize by this time what
a naughty thing he did."
So Willie was released from durance
vile.
Puzzle (not of the prize variety) â
Why do so many children seem to take
so naturally to prevarication?
CHANCES.
DO not let your chances fade;
It's really better not to;
Just seize and hold them, every one,
And feel, indeed, you've got to.
For chances In this Ufe are few.
And still to miss tliem won't do-
In short, to sum the matter up.
Just do the way I don't do.
<i\/OU really are In love with that
I charming Miss de Smytiiw.
"I certain am."
"And you feel that you cannot win
her?"
"I greatly fear that I cannot."
"You should press your attentions upon
her, and you must make it a point to see
more of hen"
"Impossible."
"Why impossible?"
"I already have been with her both at
the seashore and in a ballroom."
I HAVE noticed this thing In my time.
And It is a hint that 1 dropâ
The dregs always sink to the bottom, my
boy.
The foam always floats on the top;
And if you would get the best of the glass
To this brief opinion 1 come:
Just drink from the middle, and let tne
rest pass-
Avoid both the dregs and the scum.

The field open to the student of tropical dis
eases presents enviable opportunities since the
possession of the Philippines has come into the
hands of the United Sta;es, and the islan-Js
around thÂ« gulf also. Sanitary conditions are
to be enforced, and to know what constitutes
sar.llary conditions is a great study In itself.
Certain germs are peculiar to the region In
which they are found and will not exist In
r.ther regions. The disease- exlets beat in
the human body because of the even tempera
ture there an<l the favorable conditions under
which it multiplies.
The ankylostomias germ is deadly In effects
aft*.- It once gets a footnoid, appearing from
time to time on the plantations in tropical
climes. H caufie* anaemia and later death.
Pprsons* are striiken with It by the attack of
the ankyslcstoniia insect. ThÂ« rapidity with
wblcta it reproduces offspring soon infects the
whole body with deadly effect.
It was at first supposed that the. insert found
entrance to the system through the alimentary
canal or mucous membrane, but It has boon
found, upon Investigation, that it enter*
through the skin wherever it happens tn iight.
Sir Patrick Manson, K. C. M. G., F. R.
S., etc., the worlds greatest authority
on the relation of insects to the trans
mission of disease and the first to point
out the role of the mosquito in pathol
ogy, began a series of nine lectures be
fore the students of the Cooper Medical
College last night.
Sir Patrick addressed the scientists
on "Tho Etiological Factors In Tropical
Disease, Exemplified by Epiphytic Dis
ease; Ankylostomiasis," and explained
the' symptoms, results and causes of
the mysterious sicknesses transmitted
through insects.
Because of the acquisition of tropical
country by the United States, with the
policy of future expansion tending to
more of the same territory, it was
pointed out, the study of leprosy, sleep
ing sickness, yellow fever, aenemla,
will take an Important place in the cur
riculum of medicine in fitting men for
practice in such regions.
The lecturer told of the prophylactic
measures necessary to Insure the pro
tection of the inhabitants of tropical
countries from the diseases that annu
ally caused the death of many of the
afflicted. He was emphatic In speaking
of the part the mosquito plays in the
cause and transmission of disease. The
great amount of work he had accom
plished has been in the line of eradicat
ing the winged pest.
In introducing the lecturer. President
ESMinwood of the college referred to
him as the king of pathologists. He
told of the purpose of the school. to get
the very best men to advise the stu
dents, and how Sir Patrick Manson
â¢.\u25a0anie all the way from London at the
invitation of the faculty.
The great authority on tropical dis
eases will endeavor to cover the entire
field during the series of addresses be

Forwarding a photo of a splendidly
handsome and healthy young boy, a
happy mother writes from an Ohio
rovrn:
"The enclosed picture Ehows my 4-
vear-old Grape-JCuts boy.
"Since he was 2 years old he has eat-
en nothing but Grape-NutÃ. He de-
mands and gets this food three times
a day. This may seem rather unusual,
but he does not care for anything: else
after he has eaten his Grape-Nuts,
which be uses with milk or cream, and
ihen he is through with his meal. Even
on Thanksgiving Day ho refused tur-
key and all the good thii-.gs that make
up that great dinner, and ate his dish
of Grape-Nuts and cream with the best
reuults and none of the evils that the
other foolish members of the family
experienced.
"He is never sick, has a beautiful
complexion, and is considered a very
handsome boy. May the Postum Com-

nish their wholesome food!" Name

THE PREDICTIONS OF
ZADOC SARAT.
1000 POST ST.
Over three months ago I predicted that the
Montgomery Mountain, in \u25a0 Bullfrog District,
Nevada, would produce millions to the owners.
The property has been sold, as I predicted, to
an Eastern syndicate headed by that active and
eminent millionaire, Charles M. Schwab, for
upwards of $3,000,000 cash. I now predict that
Charles M. Schwab will make more than $50,-
000,000 out of his Interest in the Montgomery
Mountain. I I have made many other predic-
tions for miners in Nevada that have been and
are now being proven true. My clients are
making millions from my advice.

CHICAGO, Aug. 14. â Soaking rains in the
spring wheat country, where dry weather is
reeded for the finishing and harvesting of the
crop, gave the wheat market a semblance of'
strength at the start. Minneapolis quotations
came etrong and accentuated the bullish sen-
! tlment. September price* at the opening
Â«howed %fi^*c to 1 ,4<5 ) %c advance at 81% c to
81% c. Subsequent news afforded little sup
port for the upturn, however, and early buyers
, began to liquidate. As a result September re\.
ceded to SO%(fiSO%c. Acceptances from the j
Southwest were liberal and so were selling or- !
ders from the Northwest. One report, which :
I induced selling by pit traders, told of an un-
: usual amount of steamers chartered for au-
I tumn shipments from Russian seaports and
forecasting an enormous crop In that eounti-y.
A rally occurred late in the session, due chiefly
! to " 'shorts" covering on a report of improved
1 export business. September closed easy, %c
j lower at SlM,&BlÂ»4c.
The corn market was affected by wet weather
prevailing throughout the Southwest, which
has seemingly broken the drought and silenced
i reports of crop damage. Country acceptances
! were heavy. September closed easy, '"4c lower
at 53e.
Oats exhibited steadiness early, but. buc
cunibed to weakness in other grains. Septem
ber closed weak, liO^c lower at 25?ic.
The heaviness in grains was communicated
i to the provisions market, but after yielding a
trifle offerings became light and business
i dragged. September porfe closed unchanged,
lard was up a shade and ribs were 10@12%c
higtier.

NEW YORK. Aug. 14.â The speculative
force* which developed in last week's Â«tock
r.arket path*red energy for a rush with the
opening of the week, which swept the whole of
the early market to a higher level cf prices.
The very large celling to take profit which the
irarket had to encounter had increasing en>?ct
*t the day progressed and gave the later mar
ket tome appearance of weariness, but there
Vfcs no mistaking the increased force of the
miscellaneous outFHe demand coming from va
rious sources through conunleeion houses, which
rr.aiie itself manifest In the accumulation of
lf.rs:e buying orders over Sunday. The suffi
ojÂ»".' y of this new demand to absorb the large
trr ne to take profits was matter for satisfac
tion to the advocates of an advance In prices.
The quietness of the later demand, however.
*!:owed that the accumulated orders at the
<;ienlng were not followed up in equal volume.
Th* professional element was left rather obvi
ously to take the market in' hand again. This
they did by the renewal of laet week's tactics
c' t-uocessive advances here and there in the
market. The volatile high priced stocks con
tinued largely in evidence, but some of those
vhk* figured most conspicuously laÂ« week
â¢Â»ere somewhat reactionary. The day's deal
ir.jrs. which made on the whole a broad and ef
fective market, were besed oh the general
considerations which were already making
themselves felt last week. Principal cf those
If the crop outlook af= defined fey last week'p
Government report. Day to day reports of
*reatS'Cr conditions keep the feeling of oor.fi
<!ence"la the prospectus outcome of the grain
crop. Railroad officials in the customary
irtekly reviews published to-day spoke of the
Â«ider:ing effect through all lines of business cf
the cheerful outlook over the crops and ln
dulred in conic very, roseate views of the pros
pective railroad earning* ror the new fiscal
year. Available equipment la said to be on a
dimlElshlrg scale an.l f(-ar of rust damage to
Trhea-t in thÂ« Northwest ii ellcsed to have

d'-ntfcd yield of the com crop and the corn
Crar-gprs came inv> Viated prominence in thÂ«
lÂ«ter hours of ':.i> \u25a0Cay' >â¢ market. Raw copper
had erKÂ»ther advance and the fsvorable reports
frcra the Iron er.d eteÂ«J trade showed an un
changed, ter.or. A good rJlect was produced by
the r*port that Â»he dispute over freight rat^p
on certain articles as b^twe-en the Atlantic and
OuJf llnee had Â»joea settled cad thÂ« cutting of
ntÂ«e done away with. Attention wks given
elso to reports that the purpose to call an Â«.-x
tra cession of Congress had been reconFidered,
thuÂ«" promiFir.p deiay in the bringing forward of
questions which are viewed with some perturba
tion from the ftock market's standpoint. ThÂ«
progreFs of the Portsmouth conference was feit

assertions that American bankers were being
founded with a view of sharing In a Russian

"Advices received from the coast continued to
report more favorable crop prospects. There
was a moderate amount of contracting for the
19C5 crop being done and the prices paid
ranged from 14c to 15c. according to locality.
Up State advices reported steady markets and
the outlook for the crop is a yield of 15 to -5
per cent less than -last year. Cable advices
have been received from Europe reportfng that
in Germany the crop Is in need of rain, but
that' in Bohemia . crop prospects are .favorable
and that the German and Bohemian crops to
gether promise to yield about 12% per cent
more than last year. The spot market was

Receipts of the leadtng Varieties of deciduous
fruits were light, but there was no shortage
of anything and, with local trade of a light
routine character and the canners not ready to
resume active buying, the market had a "weak
tone and i prices of everything except choice
Berries and Citrus goods had a downward
tendency. Melons and Grapes were decidedly
weak, uhe weather boing .against /trade, and
handlers found it impossible to efitct clear
ances even at round concessions. Figs were
plentiful and cheap, but met wiih very little
call, consumers, having evidently tired of them.
There ' was very ' little doing in Apples and
Quinces, only gilt-edged oSerings being
wanted. Packed drrerlngs of Plums and Prunes
were scarce and. firmly held for shipping-pur
poses, while loose lots were offering to the
trade at jlow irregular rates. . Citrus
goods were quiet, but the market ruled firm,
being slenderly supplied.

BOY OF THE HOTEL JACIXTO
Walter J. Hall Accused of Stealing Two
Trunks Belonging to Horatio
J. Green.
Tha police are searching for Walter jj Hall,
an elevator boy. who is accused of stealing
two trunks containing- clothing and other ef
fects of the value of about $500 belonging to
Horatio J* Green and wife. Green and his
wife- arrived from Portland on Friday even
ing and went to the Jacinto Hotel, 470 Ellis
street, where he secured rooms.
Green handed two checks for his trunks to

not make their appearance on Saturday and
Green became suspicious that something waa
wrong. He notified the police and Detective
Cottle was detailed to Investigate. Cottle, ac
companied by Green, went to the. ferry and
discovered that the checks had been presented
and the trunks taken away.
It developed that Hall had been temporarily
iictintr as elevator boy at the Jacinto for H.
Blumenthal. who had gene to the prizefight
at Colma. When Blumenthal returned late that
night Hall did not say anything to him about
the checks for Green's trunks. Hall was to

\u25a0Warrant Obtained for the Arrest of Dr.
XV, 11. Former for Failure
to Provide.
Mrs. Kate Former, who is rooming in Ala
meda, obtained a warrant from Police Judge
Fritz yesterday for the arrest of her husband.
Dr. W. H. Former, on a charge of failure to
provide for their son. William, 15 years ' of
age. She was accompanied by her attorney,
Archibald Barnard.
Mrs. Former arrived here on Sunday nl?ht.
She says ehe has been for years endeavoring
to conrnel her husband to support the boy,
who Is in New York. He deserted her in New
York and she traced him to a town in Penn
sylvania. She went there and had him ar
rested. She obtained Judgment against him,
but he fled. Then she traced him ; to a town
In Colorado, where the game performance was
gone through .
It was only recently that she learned he
had been in this city for several months and
she immediately left New York and reached
here on Sunday night. She went to live with
friends In Alameda. She says - her husband
has no offices, but hi? makes considerable
money as a traveling physician.

The Twentieth. Street Improvement Club will

bund Hall. Twenty-fourth street and Potrero
avenue, i Many matters of Importance will be
brought up for consideration. The matter of
grading: Twentieth street from Potrero avenue

Among men a wholesome fear of the
gun often conduces to show careful
speech.
When the wife of Edwin P. Sweeney
decided that her pursuit of happiness
would be promoted : by leaving her : hus
band's companionship and keeping board
ers, she probably imagined he would su
pinely submit to the separation and for
ever permit her to go as she pleased, but
ere she was fairly, installed in her new
domicile, at Twenty-second and Mission
streets, there came bitter realization that
she had deluded herself. Edwin* declined
to be absolutely removed \ from' her life.
If ho had practiced his "hounding", and
"pestering" at reasonable , hours: of ;the
day or night the lady-might have borne
his conduct in silent suffering, but he
selected the very ; small hdurs of morn-
Ing for, his visits to, her house."! .Said

Thomas Wren, a email boy, was accused
of having stolen from Peter Vldovich of
C9O Brannan street a package of meat
valued at twenty-five cents, but the for
mal complaint placed the value at "twen
ty-flve hundred dollars," and when the
document was read to Thomas Wren in
Judge Conlan's court he almost swooned
with mingled astonishment and fright.
"Goe!" he gasped, clutching an arm of
his counsel. "Twenty-five* hundred dol
lars! Say, It wasn't a bunch of cows I
took!"
When the tautology . was explained to
the youth, his mind; was so greatly re
lieved that he scarcely noticed the Judge's
continuance of the case.
"To prove that the liquid contained in
the vial found in my client's possession is
not 'knockout drops,', but absolutely In
nocuous," said the eloquent young advo
cate, "he will drink it in your Honor's
presence." -
But the client, a soldier from' the Pre
sidio, did not respond to the suggestion
with anything like alacrity. And when
Judge Fritz proposed that the attorney
himself gulp the contents of the vial the
proposal was ignored. So the case was
continued until to-day In order to have
the liquid subjected to chemical analysis.
Charles Goff was the soldier's name,
and when arrested for disturbing the
peace of his comrades in^ a "Pacific-street
saloon the policeman found in his pockets
not only the- suspected vial, but also a
brass "knuckle-duster."
When the driver of Undertaker Carew's
mortuary wagon- descended from his
perch and entered a restaurant at Ninth
and Market streets the somber vehicle at
tracted the attention of Denis Lagan,
who was unsteadily wending homeward.
"Why," soliloquized Mr. Lagan, "should
I (hie) walk while a (hie) carriage is
(hie) standln' here doin' (hie) nothin'?"
He answered the self-addressed query
by clambering to the wagon seat, picking
up the reins and shouting "Giddap" at
the horses. The animals promptly re
sponded, and ,when their proper custo
dian, refreshed by coffee, emerged from
the restaurant Mr. Lagan was being
hauled at a rate of speed unbecoming
the character of the medium of convey
ance to his home in the Mission.
When placed before Judge Conlan and
requested to plead to the charge of hav
ing driven away the wagon without its
owner's permission Mr. Lagan declared
he was intoxicated when he committed
the offense, else he certainly would have
chosen a less funereal means of home
going. He will be sentenced this morn
ing. *
And when Sergeant Shaw requested him
to consider himself in custody he ques
tioned that officer's ability to take him
to prison, and subsequently resisted him
with so much vigor that the delivery of
the right swing was essential to his sub
jugation.
He was held for sentence on the peace
disturbance charge, and the battery ac
cusation was pronounced null and void.

William Zachozerski, accused of
stealing a stove from Arnold Lavin's
stock of hardware at 1686 Mission
street by selling it for 53 to a friend
of his named Layette, although it was
worth $10 of any shrewd speculator's
money, declared he had a perfect right
to make the sale, inasmuch as by oral
agreement he was the complainant's
business partner? Judge Fritz there
upon gave him until to-day to prove
the alleged partnership. â
Judge Fritz dismissed Mr. , Comi and
fined Mr. Migno in a sum of $5 for In
terfering with a policeman.
Mr. Migno's oral appeal was supple
mented with physical endeavor to re
lease the opulent Mr. Comi from his
custodian's clutch, and he, too, was ar
rested.
"Say, wotinell 'r' yah pinchin' dat

â¢ Patrolman Minehan-arrested J. Fran
cis Comi for drunkenness in Pinckney
place, and as s he was escorting his
prisoner to the pearest patrol box
Charles Mlgno, saloon-keeper, accosted
him and spake as follows:
Then the rabbits abruptly and mys
teriously disappeared, and no person in
the courtroom could inform the inter
ested bailiffs whither they had gone:
Six defunct cotton-tail rabbits were
offered as material evidence that Gio
vanni Varney did discharge firearms
within the city boundaries and close to
Golden Gate Park, and Patrolman Levy
swore that'he not only heard? the re
port of Signor Varney's shotgun, but
actually saw him shoot. Yet the Signor
blandly informed Judge Fritz that he
killed the rabbits at San Pedro, which
is beyond the county. line, but the plea
was ignored and a pronouncement â¢ of
guilty handed down. \u25a0*'. "-â¢
Marion Laramore, a bright seventeen
year-old, calmly averred that ere he
indulged in the stone-throwing j for
which he was arrested at First and Te
hama streets, his right jaw had been
smitten with a fragment of rock, about
the size of a lien's egg, and he believed
â¢ that the person who hurled it was con
cealed on the roof of a near-by house.
"Do you mean to tell me," incredu
lously Inquired Judge Fritz, "that an
egg-sized stone cast from a roof struck
your jaw and made no injury?"
"Yes, sir," was the unruffled reply.
"And yet," mused his Honor, "one
Battling Nelson has acquired fame and
ducats because he refrains from going
to sleep when his jaw has been jolted
with a soft glove. Go home, Master
Laramore, and consider yourself a mar
vel of ability to withstand physical
punishment â If not of ability to pre
varicate." *>

His Honor is devising ways and means
to prevent Mr. Sweeney from renewing
the persecution of his better half, which
was interrupted by his arrest on her com
plaint.
"If he isn't compelled to let me alone,"
said Mrs. Sweeney to Judge Fritz, "I
won't have a boarder leftj for each of
them has told me that unless sleep is ob
tainable in. my house I will soon be Its
sole occupant. They sympathize with me,
of course, but they can't afford to be kept
awake all night."
pullfng a knob attached to a wire, and
each pull brings a responsive clanging,
brazen, loud and prolonged. One pull was
sufficient to awaken all the inmates, but
Mr. Sweeney did not satisfy himself with
one. It was his wont to linger with the
knob In his and repeat his jerks
until every one in the house was out of
bed and" in fighting mood. Then he dis
creetly retired. '
John Francis Green, second officer of
tho steamship Siberia, was rearrested
yesterday morning immediately after
having been discharged by United
States Commissioner Heacock. Green
was before the commissioner on pre
liminary examination on a charge of
having obtained a mariner's license by
presenting a forged certificate of natu
ralization. Assistant United States At
torney George Clark announced that
the prosecution was not then ready to
make public the evidence it had against
Screen, as other persons not yet arrested
were implicated. The rearrest was on
on the charge or having fraudulently
registered as a voter in this city on
July 7. 1904.
Julius Svenson, another prisoner, con
fessed that he paid Jansen $12 50 for a
forged certificate purporting to have
been issued out of Judge Graham's
court and 6igned W. C. Raisch as clerk.
On March 16 of this year he obtained a
license as second mate upon presenta
tion of this forged document.
Hans Morthenson, second mate of the
Phenix, was the next prisoner. He con
fessed that he received a forged copy
af a naturalization certificate from
William J. Burke, who conducted a
navigation school in this city. Morth
ensen paid Burke $50 for a course of
lessons in navigation and received the
forged paper as a prize package in
1900. Since then Mr. Burke has navi
gated to uncharted whereabouts. His
paper purports to have been issued by
Superior Judge Beiclier on October 30,
18S6. C. Sturland, 2SO East street, and
Thomas Ahkman, 118 East street, were
signed as witnesses. Deputy County
Clerk William R. Jost's name was sign
ed to the certificate.
Upon this paper he secured a license
at Seattle as master and in this city
as pilot on October 18 of last year.
Five arrests of aliens guilty of
fraudulent naturalization were made
yesterday by United States Secret Ser
vice Agent Richard H. Taylor. All , the
prisoners confessed and surrendered
the forged naturalization certificates
upon which they had secured from the
United States Local Inspectors licenses
as mates, masters and pilots. Many of
these papers purported to be certified
copies of certificates of naturalization
and to be signed by William C. Raisch,
deputy county clerk, assigned to Su
peror Judge George Bahrs' court.
Raisch is under arrest on charges of
having forged the papers.
Rudolf Rasmussen. second mate of
the steam schooner Elizabeth, was the
first arrested. He secured his license
on September 2, 1903, on presentation of
a pretended copy of a certificate of
naturalization issued by Superior Judge
Bahrs and certified by Raisch. . The wit
nesses named In the paper are S. Es
tola, 116 Berry street, and F. Johnson,
lIS Cortland avenue. Rasmussen con
fessed to Agent Taylor that he paid F.
Jansen, known otherwise as F. Johnson,
$15 for the forged certificate in Au
g-uet, 1000. Rasmussen had taken the
place of Carl Lind, who was taken off
the Elizabeth by Agent Taylor.
John O. Odland, master of the schoon
er Phenix. was found with a forged cer
tificate from Judge Sanderson's court,
dated January 12, 1903. Jansen, other
wise Johnson, and D. E. Tldorrd were
the witnesses. Tldorrd's name was
signed as deputy county clerk. Odland
confessed that he had never appeared
before any court to be naturalized and
that he had bought the forged paper
from Jansen.
Superintendent Langdon reported a
largely increased attendance in the
Girls' High, Mission High and Poly
technic high schools. A new feature
inaugurated was the kindergarten class
In the Jefferson School. The compul
sory education law will be enforced
rigidly and all children under 14 years
who are working will be compelled to
go to school by Labor Commissioner
Stafford. A system of cross-checking
will be used to keep tab on pupils dur
ing the period when the law requires
them to be at school. This will result
in a decided increase in attendance and
insure a good revenue from the State
under the new apportionment law.
Thirty-six substitute teachers were
sent out to various schools, most of
which were organized and running
regularly by 11 o'clock a. m.
The Fairmount School had an over
flow of 60 pupils, with one class con
taining 64 and another 70. The princi
pal said classes would have to be held
in the yard and two portable schools
will be provided.
There was an overflow of 80 pupils
in the Lafayette School and many pu
pils could not be accommodated in the
Richmond and Jefferson schools. The
Chinese school, which has grown from
five classes to eight in the past three
months, will be given another class
room and teacher.
Principal Mark sent word that he
was unable to take care of 200 pupils

OVERFLOW AT LAFAYETTE.
The following transfers were ordered:
A. F. Hucks, from the Cooper Primary
School to the Clement Grammar School,
vice Leah Roseberg, transferred to the
day substitute class at her own request.
The public schools opened yesterday
for the new term, with an overflowing
attendance, it being estimated that 42,
000 pupils were enrolled. The condi
tions existing necessitated the forma
tion of a number of new classes and
the Board of Education held a meeting
late yesterday afternoon to take ac
tion.
The resignations of Etta. Hawley, a
member of the day substitute class, and
of Mary Burke Garside (nee Burke), a pro
bationary teacher in the Monroe Primary
School, were accepted by the board.
The president and secretary were au
thorized to enter into a lease with the
Aetna Mutual Building and Loan Asso
ciation for the premises situated at 1140
Oak street, commencing August 16, 1905,
and ending December 31, 1905, at a month
ly rental of $100, the same being for the
accommodation of the pupils of the
Crocker Grammar School, pending the
completion of repairs to the latter school
building. \
Director Thomas F. Boyle, chairman ot
the Buildings and Grounds Committee, was
authorized to erect three portable school
houses, one to be used in connection with
the Richmond/ Grammar School, one in
the Fairmount School and one In the La
fayette School.
The following assignments from the day
substitute list were ordered, subject to
the usual probationary period of two
years: Lottie Sinnamon to the Monroe
Primary School, vice S. A. Ward, on
leave; Catherine Hlrstel to the Richmond
Grammar School, new class; Rachel Har
ris, to the Hancock Grammar School, new
class; Miss H. L. O'Connor, to the Cooper
Primary School, vice A. F. Hucks, trans
ferred.
LEASE MORE ROOMS.
The board has received information that
at least three teachers have married, one
being now in New York, and they have
no present intention of reporting for duty.
The board takes the ground that the
appointment of a married teacher bars
out an equally competent unmarried wo
man, who is thrown upon her own re
sources for a living.
The Board of Education met yesterday
and adopted a resolution declaring va
cant the positions of all female teachers
on the probationary and substitute lists
who have married since they were placed
thereon. The board has adopted a rule
providing against the appointment of any
married teacher to a position in the de
partment, but the courts have held that
the rule Is nugatory in so far as it affects
the removal of any teacher who has
served her probationary term of two
years.

Police Sergeant Hit
or Hand Would
Be Sound.
When the right flst of Police Sergeant
Shaw swung against the adamantine head
of Alfred Barrir, who was resisting ar
rest, the sergeant received about 90 per
cent of the total damage. His hand was
crippled as he recounted the Incident to
Judge Conlan, before whom Mr. Barrir
stood accused of peace disturbance and
battery.
"But my client," thundered the attor
ney for the defense, "should not be held
responsible for this officer's injury!"
Then, turning to the defendant, he earn
estly inquired: "Did you Intentionally
hurt this complainant's hand?"
"Nein," was the answer, delivered with
equal earnestnees; "indeed I neffer did."
"Does the court hear that?" triumph
antly shouted the pleader. "My client
says, 'No, 1 never did.' Now, may it
please your Honor, I move for dismissal
of the battery charge. If the complain
ant had not struck my client's head, or If
my client's head were softer than It laâ
as soft as his heart apparently isâ the
complainant's hand would not have been
injured."
Into the stolid countenance of Mr. Bar
rir there crept an expression remotely
suggestive of benignity, evidently intend
ed to corroborate the advocate's tribute
to his pulpiness of heart, and he -la
boriously maintained it throughout the
remainder of the proceedings.
He was arrested last Saturday evening
in a Japanese restaurant on Dupont
street, and numerous little brown men
testified that his behavior was offensively
boisterous, he having undertaken to dis
cipline the attaches of the place, in which
he had no pecuniary interest whatever.

Action Against _ Dental
Board for Favoritism
ACCUSE "SOLID FIVE"
President Baird Testifies
Against Fellow Members,
Dr. Cool and Dr. r Dunn
The troubles of the State Board of
Dental Examiners seem to have Just
begun. For two weeks the investigat
ing commission. appointed by Governor
Pardoe *ias been probing deeply and
bringing out sensational evidence of
animosity and irregularity .that, ha*
startled the public. On top. ' of .this
comes the announcement that the board
will be subjected to a damage. suit by
those unfortunate students who failed
to Dass the last State examinations.-^. ;
At -the opening of the afternoon'seV
sion yesterday Attorney Feigenb^aum
rose and stated that he was prepared to
fllea series of suits against the board
in the names of several displaced stu
dents. He said he had startling evi
dence from two recent studentsâ one of
them turned down because of a row he
had had with Dr. Balrd and the other
in a like predicament through trouble
with Dr. Herrick. Feigenbaum said that
he had plenty of evidence to prove that
flagrant injustice and' rank favoritism
prevailed. He further made the state
ment that the "solid two" had always
tried to do the fair thing, but that the
"solid v nve" had defeated them.
AVith this exception, the proceedings
dragged throughout the day. President
Balrd was on the stand much of the
time. He further exposed the animosi
ties which existed between the members
of the body, of- which he was the head.
He made the rather startliny. Insinua
tion that most .of the trouble in the
board was the result of Dj.' Cool's de
feated aspirations for .the#presidency.
He alleged that he waaÂ»threatened by
this member of the board >immediately
after his election to .the -presidency.
. Dr. Balrd also swore: that Dr. Dunn 1
had performed the duties ,of . treasurer
in a very careless manner^and that he
had been Informed that Dr. Dunn was
at one time far behind and was begging
friends to help him raise the money.
This information he attributed as com
ing from Dr. Cool.
Both Dr. Dunn and Dr. Cool denied
these statements almost in their entire
ty. They allege that the facts have
been twisted and enlarged. Dr. Dunn
says that he had his books experted
and that they were found to be straight
in every particular. Dr. Cool says he
will clear up the whole matter when
he takes the stand.
C. R. Johnson, the dental supply man
who was accused of having obtained di
rect information from a member of the
board, supposedly Dr. Mayhew, as to the
grading of the applicants, testified that
this was not the case. He had been
playing with the fellows who had spok
en to him regarding the matter.
There is still another suit which now
faces the "solid five" alone. Dr. S. G.
Shaefer was arrested in Los Angeles
for practicing without a license. He
maintained that he was illegally ar
rested and sued the board for $50,000.
He has- now released Drs. Dunn and
Cool from any liability, but still chooses
to hold the other members.
The session' of the investigating
commission will be resumed at 9 o'clock
to-morrow morning, r

Captain Tyler had called on the British
Consul General immediately after his ar
rival, and when his disappearance was
reported the British representative at
once engaged the services of Captain
Harry Morse's agents to investigate. Yes
terday the management of the- Occidental
carefully searched the missing man's
room with the hope of finding something
that might lead to the solution of the
mystery, but the work was fruitless.
Captain Tyler left his apartments as if
he had simply, intended to -visit the hotel
office. He, was' not' a drinking man, and
his acquaintances are at a loss for an ex
piation for his strange absence.
Captain Tyler, relieved from duty in the
Far East, arrived here by way of the
northern route on August 4 and took
apartments . at the Occidental Hotel. The
following day he dined with W. H. Avery
of the Toyo Kisen Kalsha Steamship
Company, Professor Howard' Swan. late
of China, and several other acquaint
ances. The next day the captain dropped
out "of sight, and since then not the
slightest inkling of his whereabouts has
been received. _â¢ -â\u25a0 . _
Considerable mystery surrounds the dis
appearance from the Occidental Hotel of
Captain P. R. Tyler of the British army,
who recently arrived from the Orient.
Uncertain as to the missing man's fate,
the British Consul General at this port
has Instituted an inquiry and employed
detectives to investigate the peculiar

Colonel Lewisky lectured before the

In the Young Men's Christian Association
hall 'yesterday and Impressed them with
his "struggles against the bigotry of the
Russian Government in subduing the
freedom of religious thought. He recited
his experiences while he was in exile for
establishing a school to teach the children
Christianity.
The popular conception of religion Is that
God made the world. ' then retired to watch
the outcome, but this belief is wronjr and is
the source of trouble in the thmkingr out of
problems. If we listen to scientists, some of
thÂ«se days they will conduct God to the frontier
and throw him out. but it is for us to retain
him as the only instructor.
The removal of intricate and false religious
conceptions was left to the philosophers and
they have been mainly responsible for the pres
ent change In religious thought. They found
that things happen and have results. Changes
take place In nature and man â and we de
termine It is God who Is responsible for these
changes.
It has been only a quarter of a century ago
since there were bitter controversies going oa
ovÂ«r trivial religious matters, but -In 1870 &
decided change was noticeable, and men no
longer wasted . their time discussing problems
that were sure to remain unsettled until men
tire of debate. Early In 1880 ministers of :ha
gospel began a campaign against this sort of
thing, and rational methods were adopted. In
stead of the previous bickerings, we now hays
the workers dome good by other ways.
RELIGIOUS BICKEIUXGS ENDED.
Bishop John W. Hamilton introduced
Dr. Bowne. The Bishop touched on the
great work done by the latter by his In
fluence at the university. The Bishop as
sured the audience that the great change
that has come over the religious world
was inspired by such men as Dr. Bowne.
The convention was called to order by
the Rev. George M. White, pastor of the
Central Methodist Church, and he
thanked the speaker for his attendance.
The following is a synopsis of Dr.
Bowne's remarks:
The reason for confusion in thinking 1 out
the problems that beset the reitglous world
from time to time is the crude philosophy
men apply to the solution of the matter. It
has been often said If logic had Its way. re
ligion would be null for the logicians question
our methods. . .

While here Mr. Calhoun will give
considerable of his time to studying
many needs of improvement along the
lines of the United Railroads and pro
posed extensions of the service.
Patrick Calhoun, one of the threa
largest stockholders of the United
Railroads, arrived here yesterday from
the East and is registered at the Palace!
Hotel. He has come West In connection,
with the affairs of the local street rail-:
road system, and to again discuss w:-^
the Sutter Street Improvement Cluo
the proposed reconstruction of the Sut
ter street cable road and its branches.
Discussing that matter, Mr. Calhoun
said yesterday:
"It Is pretty hard to predict what de
termination we will finally arrive at.
As I stated to the representatives of
the improvement club at our last con
ference. I am ready to admit that an
underground electric- system Is by no
means impracticable and it can be op
erated In San Francisco, but not as suc
cessfully as the trolley system. There
are many things to contend with In an
underground system, and especially in
this city, where water and dirt materi
ally interfere with the transmission o*
the electric current. The experience oÂ£
the railroad companies all over the
world has been that the overhead ser
vice is the most satisfactory, both in
the way of economy and in the matter
of public convenience. In some cities
there is an objection to the overhead
wires, but I believe that this opposition
has an esthetlcal character."

WONDERFUL CURE BY
CUTICURA REMEDIES
\u25a0 -
" My little son, s boy of five, broke
out With an itching rash. Three doc-
tors prescribed fox him, but he kept
getting worse until we could not dress
him any more. They finally advised
me to try a certain medical College,
but its treatment did no good. At the
time I was induced to try Cuticura
he was so bad that I had to cut his
hair off and put the Cuticura Ointment
on him on bandages, as it was impos-
sible to touch him with the bare hand.
There was not one square inch of skin
on his whole body that was not affected.
He was one mass of sores. The band-
ages used to stick to his skin and in
removing them it used to take the skin
off with them, and the screams from
the poor child were heartbreaking. I
began to think that he would never get
well, but after the second application
of Cuticura Ointment I began to see
signs of improvement, nnd with the
third and fourth applications the sores
commenced to dry up. His skin peeled
off twenty times, but it finally yielded
to the treatment. Now I can say that
he is entirely cured, and a stronger and
healthier boy you never saw than he is
to-day. Robert Wattam, 4922 Center
