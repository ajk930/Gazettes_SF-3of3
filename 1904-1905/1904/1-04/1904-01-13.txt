ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 12.â
From a very highly placed gen
eral I am enabled to tell you that
communications of the â¢ highest
importance are now passing con
stantly over the wires between
Admiral AJexieff and the Empe
ror. On' these much depends.
The monarch, while extremely
desirous of peace, is equally firm
concerning Russia's prestige, and
he trusts, now that matters are so
far advanced and â¢ are ' in such a
critical phase, entirely to the. good
judgment- of the viceroy as to
what.is necessary r to be done. My
informant, the , general, a con
firmed friend of peace, says:
"There may/ still be hopes of
peace left, but I fear^the. political
atmosphere is charged with elec
tricity and the .storm may break
at any moment. One thing I can
tell you is that the general staff is
most fully prepared 'for an out
break of. war. All our,arrange
ments are, perfect up- to the last
item. All we have got to do now
is to press a button and the whole
machinery will start working!"
*A colonel of the -War Office
staff who knows Man'churia and
China well said this. afternoon :
"Mark my words, 7 Japan, will
never fight us. She "is 'merely bar
tering to make . the best ; bargain

will make terms. . \ '

been at the head and front of many

which is erected the finest shaft house
in the world, is once more coming into
â¢S. bonanza. Water Is going: down In

CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo.. Jan. 12.â A
Btrike of ore almost two feet wide and
cf fabulous richness has been opened
within the last few days in one of the
properties owned by the United Mines
Company that !s under IÂ»*ase to com
petent miners that thoroughly under
stand its worth. An idea of the value
of the rock in the rich streak can be3t
be stated wh*n It is positively known
that picked specimens are 'worth bet
ter than $100,000 per ton, but it is most
likely that the two feet of ore exposed
v.ill average from $5000 to $15,000 a ton.
Armed guards surround the property
and even while two men are breaking
very rich ore a guard is over them.
Xews of the wonderful find is creat
ing a furor over the district. The
strike has '"leaked out a little" and
wires are hot from mining men all over
the country asking for direct and pos
itive information.
Special Â£HÂ«pa.teh to -The Call
The grand jury has been in session
for several weeks and rumors have
been in circulation during the past
week to the effect that the Supervisors
were under investigation and that some
startling facts had been brought to
light. Nothing definite was made
known, however, till the report was
given out to-day.
Burleigh is specifically charged with
having hired men at low wages to do
road work and j then sent in fictitious
bills to the county, pocketing whatever
might he. left after the wages . were
paid. The indictments against Jaggers,
Imperatrice and Thompson were
brought because of their alleged com
plicity in. the transaction. The charge
is made also that Burleigh used county
employes to chop down trees on a coun
ty road and convert it into cbrdwood
for his private use.
i'RESNO, Jan. 12.â The grand jury,
to-day filed the most* sensational report
ever presented by a grand jury in this
county. Supervisor Burlei^h is accused
of. malfeasance in office and is asked to
show cause why he should not be re
moved from office. A. .aggers, the
roadmaster in Burlelph's district, was
indicted for misappropriation of pub
1L- funds. D. Imperatrice and J.
Thompson, also employes in Uurleigh's
district, were indicted on similar
charges.

Evidence of a most damaging nature
was secured yesterday by Chief of Po
lice Wittraan and Detective Tom Gib
son against Leon S. Soedcr. the cook
that is suspected of having lured his
brother-in-law, Joseph* Blaise, from his
home in Germany and murdering him
in 'a m6st cold-blooded manner last
Sunday night at the foot of Russian
Hill. ../. :
The most important .facts brought to
light yelsterda'y" against Soeder were
those " of* his record as an ex-convict;
his connection with an attempt to coun
terfeit geld coins; cleaning of the suit
of clothes he wore last Sunday; pawn
ing of a revolver which he denied own
ing, and a final admission that be had
been married twice and that his first
wife had disappeared.
Chief o'f Police Wittman feels cer
tain that Soeder is guilty of murder
ing Blaise for the purpose of securing
the .insurance carried on the life o*
the murdered man. and the facts
brought to light yesterday are looked
upon as most important links in the
chain oC evidence that the police de
partment is now weaving around the
man under arrest.
Soeder admits that he went to Eu
rope and induced his brother-in-law to
come to thia country and try his for
tune; he also admits that he insured
Blaise's life in his own favor, bat hi*
admissions end there.
GrVEN "SWEATING" PROCESS.
Soeder denies that he killed Blaise,
and whatever damaging evidence tho
police have so far secured against the
suspect bas been wrung from him by
the most searching examination.
Soeder was taken before .'Chief of
Police Wittman twice yesterday and
given* a severe questioning. -In police
parlance, the "sweating process" was
productive of good results.
After the first examination of Soeder
by Wittman and Detective Gibson.- the
suspected man fairly collapsed. He
was -seized with^a spell of vomiting
and when taken' back to bis cell in
the City Prison he was trembling in a
visible manner.
. The ' afternoon . "sweating . process"
had a similar result, and a confession
from Soeder that he Is guilty of mur
dering Blaise is looked for soon by the
police. PBW
Soeder says that he Is 37 years old
and that he came to. the United States
In the early eighties. On certain points
his memory is clear, but on others he
shows a deep cunning and will not re
member dates.
He says that he has worked as . a

Â¦ LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12. â The drought
which has continued throughout South
ern California for more* than three
months just at the season when under
normal conditions there is the most
plentiful supply of water, ia becojnlng
a serious matter to ranchers and par
ticularly to owners of livestock.
According^to a bulletin, just lssued s by
the. Weather- Bureau- this season has
been thus far the dryeat since the win
ter of 1863-64, when, according to* the
records, which .were ; tljen kept by indi
viduals, no rain featuring the" winter.
There is water for irrigation, much of
it from artesian sources, but.the, arte-'
sian plan has 'been lowered to such an
extent that many wells which have al
ways been Â¦ flowing :' wells heretofore
must now be pumped. .
The expense to cattle owners is
enormous because there is no green
feed and the prices of dry feed are ac
cordingly high. In places the absence
of water is causing suffering among
the cattle. No rain has fallen here
since October 1. There have been
slight showers in places, but no gen
eral downpour of sufficient volume ,to
do any real 'good." Despite these un-r
favorable conditions the prospects are
most flattering for an excellent citrus
crop.

TACOMA, Jan. 12.â The death of Ho
mer H. Swaney, formerly cf Pittsburg,
in the steamer Clallam disaster has re
sulted m the appointment of a receiver
for the Pacific Steel Company, of which
Swaney was president. Swaney had
purchased and enlarged the Irondale
blast .furnace, near Port Townsend, be
sides securing control of a large area
of raw iron land In British Columbia.
He had organized a steel company to
build a complete open-hearth plant, to
gether with rolling mills. Two "weeks
ago he returned from New York and
Pittsburg, where he had been to secure
money for carrying out this project.
His death will delay operations, and
caused '\ the First National Bank of
Seattle, to whom the company owed
523,000, to apply for a receiver. M. J.
Carrigan, assistant to Swaney, was ap
pointed/ receiver.
Captain C. Wi.Thompson of Tacoma,
also lost in the Clallam wreck, waa
president of the Washington Co-opera
tive Mining Syndicate and the Monte-'
zuma Mining Company of this city,
which were together developing at
Fairfax one of the largest coal proper
ties in the State. Thompson was also
an officer and director of the Tacoma
Steel Company, which purposes build
ing at West Tacoma a large steel
Â¦plant similar to that projected by
Swaney at Port Townsend. Thomp
son's death will not necessarily affect
the operations of the Tacoma Steel
Company, though the coal mine which
his other companies were opening was
Intended to furnish coal and coke for
the steel plant when built.
Henry Bucey has been appointed
receiver of the Washington Co
operative and ilontezuma companies,
on application of Millionaire Hewitt,
to whom both are indebted. The coal
property is valued at $400,000. Out
side of this the companies have lia
bilities of $40,000 and available as
sets of $24,000. Hewitt estimates it
will cost S 125,000 to put the coal
mines on a paying basis.
A clever forger, who had .been

aliases. He was taken to the City
Prison and booked "en route to Kala
mazoo, Mich.," where he is wanted
for passing a forged draft for . $"50
drawn on the Wadena (Minn.) Bank
on the American House, Kalamazoo.
The Pinkerton agency had sent cir
culars all over the country asking for
Estill's arrest and offering a reward
of ?25 made by the Illinois State
Bankers' Association. In the circular
It was stated that Estill had defrauded
hotels throughout the United States
by persuading the proprietors to cash
or indorse worthless checks or drafts
ranging in sums of from 550 to 5100.
He used an assortment of bank drafts,
which he stole while in the employ
ment of the Foreman-Bassett-Hatch
Lithographing Company. Cleveland,
Ohio. He also used the latest improved
inking check perforator. He had a dif
ferent name at each place where he
passed one of his forged drafts. ,

Estill and his wife came to the city
more than a month ago and "stopped
] at the Oriental Hotel. On December
j 11 he passed a forged draft for $75 on
) the proprietor of that hotel and lm
Â¦ mediately left, going with his wife to
j the rooming-house on Polk street. The
J local Pinkerton agency was notified of

Sheriff Shipman of Kalamazoo, who
held a warrant for Estill's arrest, .was
! notified by. telegraph that Estill was
â¢ here and he arrived in the city yester

arrest Estill before he had a. chan.ee.
i of passing another forged , draft, and
j departing for pastures new. . , ' . -, .
, MAY BE A BIGAMIST:

a well-to-do family in Kalamazoo. She
was unaware of the source of her hus

Remains of Woman Who Gave
Him; Financial Assistance
Are Borne to Resting Place
The remains of "Mammy" Pleasant,
w ho died early Monday morning at the
home of Lyman M. Sherwood on Fil
bert street* will rest to-night under the
BoiJ of th<* little cemetery in the town
of Napa, to which her body was taken
this morning. One of the last requests
of Mrs. Pleasant was that there be
placed above her grave a tombstone
bearing her name, age, nativity and
the words: "fihe was a friend of John
Brown."
One of the many interesting ptorles
of nor eventful career told by Mrs.
Pleasant was her experiences during
the exciting times preceding "the out
break of the Civil War. With the
money inherited from her first husband
Fhe had come to California and was
here in 1S5S. when the first stories of
John Brown's efforts to free the
slaves of the South were conveyed to
Fan Francisco. Being in full sympathy
with the. movement r-he conceived the
idea of lending her financial assistance
to the undertaking, and April 5. 1S58.
found her eastward bound with a $30,000
United States . treasury draft, which
had been procured for her through the
aid of Robert Swain, John W. Coleman
and William Alvord. Reaching Boston
Mrs. Pleasant arranged for a meeting
with John Brown in Windsor, Canada.
Before leaving Boston Mrs. Pleasant
had her draft exchanged for Canadian
paper, which she converted into coin
and finally turned this over to Brown
afier a conference in Canada, at which
it was agreed between them that he
Fhould not strike a blow for the free
dom of the negroes until she had jour
neyed to the South and aroused the
feeling of rebellion among her people.
Disguised as a jockey sue proceeded
to the South and was engaged in her
part of the plot when she was startled
by the news that Br&wn had already
made his raid on Harpers Ferry and
had been captured. Learning that the
authorities were in pursuit of Brown's
accomplices Mrs. Pleasant immediately
fled to New York and 'after remaining
Jn hiding for some time assumed an
other name and made her way back to
California. !
When Brown wag captured there was
found on his person a letter reading:
"The ax is laid at the root of the tree.
When the first blow is struck there
will be more money to nelp." The
meysage was signed "W. E. P." For
months the authorities vainly searched
for the author of- this message. In
later years it developed that Mrs.
Pieasant had written the letter, but in
Fignir.g it she had made her first in
itial, "M," look like a '"W." " Mrs.
riraeant always blamed Brown for
hastening his attack at Harpers Ferry,
ivhich she claimed cost her in all over
$40,000. Among her effects are letters
and documents bearing upon t,he* his
torical event in which she secretly
played an important part. Â¦ I

CONVICT RECORD FOUND.
A search yesterday of the police de
partment records showed that Soeder
was arrested and convicted in 1894 on
a charge of burglary and sentenced to
three years in San Quentin prison.
'In August, 1894, Soeder was caught
by Policeman Tannian in the act of
burglarizing t,he restaurant of A. John
son, 28 Montgomery street. The man
broke away from the officer and it was
not until Tannian fired two shots from,
his revolver that Soeder surrendered. .
He was prosecuted and convicted un
der the name of "L. S. Lekenhenlt,"
and on September 8, 1894, was sen
tenced to three years in San Quentin.
He was released from the prison on
January 11. 1897..
When Soeder was shown his prison
record and photograph yesterday by
Chief Wittman % he tried* td deny that
he was the man or that the photograph
was one of him, but he finally said,
"Well. I guess. that is me. all right."
When asked why he gave the name
of "Lekenhenlt'^at the time of his ar
rest, Soeder claimed that the name was
that of his mother.
Investigation, by Detective' Gibson
brought to light the fact that Soeder
was seen wearing a dark gray* sack suit
last Sunday. When Soeder was ques
tioned yesterday by the police he de
nied that he possessed a suit^ of that
description or that he had worn a suit
last Sunday other than a black one.
Finally Soeder admitted that he did
own a dark gray sack suit and that he
had taken it to a cleaning establish
ment last Monday morning.
TOOK SUIT TO CLEANER.
At the dyeing and cleaning works of
F. Bertin, 430-432 Bush street, Detective
Gibson located the suit of Soeder, which
had been left to be cleaned. The suit
was taken Jthere early Monday morn
ing by a young man, who stated that
Leon Soeder was the owner of it and
desired to have it cleaned at once. A
young girl. at the works received the
suit, which was drapped up In paper. '
The police will try to-day to find if
any"""of the workmen In the cleaning
establishment noticed any blood stains
on the suit. It was placed, with many
other articles, in a steam scouring ma
chine, but it may be that the workmen
tock particular notice of the suit owned
by Soeder.
An examination of the suit yesterday
showed that it had been worn but very
little, and its condition was such as to
load ,to the belief that it wa^ of recent
purchase. There was" no clew as to
where it was made, the only identifica
tion tag being one showing that it was
of "union make."
Soeder claimed yesterday that the suit
was an #ld ./jne. and^hat he had worn
it all -th^ -t,ime...lie> was traveling from
California to EuroDe^ and . back again.
He further stated that he .had the suit
made- to order last year by a tailor in
Petaluma. _. ..." - ' . â¢' r: '
The. police place great importance in
the discovery tTiat. Soeder took the suit
he...u*as& last ..Sunday ; to the. cleaning
Â¦works early the following day. Their
theory is that the suit had blood. stains
upon It resulting from the murder of

The suspect denied when questioned
that he had ever been connected with
a man named Goadello who was ar
rested and convicted of having a coun
terfeiting plant in his possession. When
confronted by letters in his own . writ
ing floeder admitted that he; had given
information leading to Goadello's ar
rest 1 " and 'conviction and had received
ft; regard' from the Government of 550.
.This -transaction' took- place in 1900. It
is thought that Soeder outlined the plan
tb^Gftaide^Idr to make 'counterfeit money
and then denounced him to.the authori
ties: for the 'purpose of securing a re
â¢^yartL.-;. ,â¢/... .
'^With' the' knowledge that detectives
-had-eeanshed his- room on Monday, last,
shortly after he was, suspected of the
murder- of his"' brother-in-law, "Soeder
proceeded 'to pawiv a, revolver and a box
of cartridges. , ',' ;.\V\' . ; ' .

MofvJay,that he-t)wned a revolver; but
when pressed Vesteriy. h^ .admitted
that he had pawned the revolver on
Third street-and -had- given - a fictitious
name. .
Soeder was taken by Gibson to Third
street and the suspected man failed to
locate the pawn-shop, but after a time
he admitted that he had pawned the
revolver at Levi's shop on Stockton
street, riear O'Farrell.
'. Detective Gibson took Soeder to the
pawn-fehop in. question and recovered
the revolver belonging to Soedet. . It
was a Smith & We"sson, hammerless,
38-calibef, and had . been pawned in
the name of "Sam Norman."
When asked why' he had pawned the
revolver Soeder replied that "he tiaofTjo
further use for H."
Soeder /Was questioned as to where
his .trunk was.- and finally admitted
that before -ne went, to Europe he sent
the trunk out for storage to the Five-

SOEDER MAKES STATEM^EXT.
Soeder waa questioned at length yes-"
terday afternoon. -in the office of Chief
Wittman, his statements being taken
down by a stenographer, , In reply to
some questions put to him he. said: . Â¦
"My brother-in-law we.nt out. three or
four times by* himself In the. evening
since our arrival in San_ Francisco, five
weeks ago. He never remained out
more than an: hour, at-any time. Last

had not, been home all night, . and ..I
went over to the house' of a frierid - . 5 in

Soeder admitted that : he was a: little
worried at, the absence, all .night qf

w%nt to; look 'for -him at his frierid'i
house. He eould ; not explain why, fde

When asked if he- had been married
more than once Soeder replied, "No, I
have only been married once."
ADMITS AXOTHER MARRIAGE.
"Are â¢ you telling the. truth?" was
asked of Soeder, and he was reminded
that his wife, who died last year at
Petaluma, had been insured for $2000,
which sum he had collected after the
woman died suddenly.
Soeder almost collapsed at the ques
tion, but he braced himself and. for
half an hour, denied .that he had ever
been married more than once. , ! .
Perfelstent examination at last drew
from him the admission that he had a
former wife, who had disappeared.
"Yes," replied Soeder, as he ! jshlftecl
uneasily In his chain "i^ was married
twice, but never rnore: **1 was "married

This important adrriission on.ithe part
of Soeder is j looked upon as very? sig

last year was regarded with suspicion^

call the attention of the' public to the fol-
lowing facts:
Qvei two and a ( half years 'ago we became
fully fatisfled that John J.-Fuitan of this city
fcafl disrovcred cures for Bright's Disease and
Dlabrtf*. tVe did not Judge hastily; We took
month* to rut uÂ»M cases on the treatment. ,W>
had leading- phyvlcians make tests. Among
th^m was the late lamented Pr, M. Gardner,
chirf surgecn of the S. P. R/ R. Co. We in-
terviewed rcore? of the cured , (there are prob-
ably Feveral thousand of them). Eighty-seven
per. cert cf the tent oases supported the acÂ«-<l
disco%-erer's claims, and the profound fact
stood out fully proven that nearly nine-tenths
of s.11 cases of Btisht's Disease. and Diabetes
are curaBle.
Â¦XTe otrafttzed to announce the great discov-

and Safe Method.
A Bemsrkable Xnmber of Coxes 2Zz.de "by

About one person in every four suf-
fers from some form of rectal disease.
The most common and annc-ying is itch-
ing piles, indicated by warmth, slight
moisture and Intense, uncontrollable
itching in the parts affected. I "' '.'Â£ ";
The usual treatment has been some
simple oir.tment or salve which some-
times give temporary relief, but noth-
ing like a permanent cure can be ex-
pected from such superficial treatment.
The only permanent cure for itching
piles yet discovered is the Pyramid Pil*
Cure, not only for itching piles but for
every other form cf piles, blind, bleed-
ing or protruding. The first applica-
tion gives instant relief and the con-
i tinued use for a short time causes a
! permanent removal of thp tumors or
' the small parasites wMch cause fh.>
1 intense itching and discomfort of itch-
ing piles.
- F..M. Collins of .440 A rmitage avenue,
Chicago, says: "Some time ago I com-
menced using Pyramid Pile Cure for
a disagreeable case of itching piles.
After using five boxes I consider my-
self entirely cured of the disagreeable
trouble, thanks to this excellent rem-
edy, and I shall never .fail to recom-
I mend it to any of my friends who may
happen to be troubled as I was."
The Pyramid Pile Cure is probably
the only pile cure extensively recom-
! mended by physicians, because it Is sa
i safe, so prompt in the . r*elief afforded
and so far as known the only positive
cure for piles.
AH druggists now sell it at 50 cents

Andrew Carnegie was introduced as
the "great apostle of arbitration and
peace."- He recalled that it was eight
een years ago when he first appeared
in Washington to urge arbitration. He
said that Great Britain was longing for
such a treaty as the conference con
templated. He said that never before
had; the English speaking race been
so close together. Speaking of insist
ence on points of honor, he declared
that the most dishonorable word in the
English language is honor.
"We have abolished the duel," -said
he. "Let it be aur race that takes the
first step to abolish international duel
ing." ;: ,
Lieutenant General Miles and Dr. Ed
ward Everett Hale earnestly voiced
their sympathy with the work. Rev.
Dr. Joseph Sherman of Temple Em
manuel, New York, spoke of the gen
eral trer.d toward arbitration.
A mass meeting was held under tfce
auspices of the. National Arbitration
Conference at the Lafayette Theater
Ui.s afternoon. General Foster presid
ed, and a number of notable speakers,
including Andrew and Cardi
nal Gibbons, occupied the platform.
Tbe resolutions adopted by the confer
*ence v/ere read and with a cheer of
aye3 the audience voted its approval.
Cardinal Gibbons then spoke:
"It is a matter of the greatest in
terest to every American citizen arid
to every lover of humanity," said he,
"that thing's are being done to estab
lish universal arbitration in the world,
not only between the great and power
ful nations who might hesitate because
of the consequences to go to m war with
one another, but also in favor of the
weaker and smaller nations in the face
of the great and powerful. I hepe and
pray for the day when the gospÂ»l of
peace will reign supreme in the world,
and when International disputes shall
be settled, not on the field of battle, in
sanguinary conflicts, but in the halls
of legislation by wise men who have
given profound study to international
questions."
CARNEGIE HAS HOPES.
"I have received through Mr, Straus
your very courteous invitation to at
tend the arbitration conference to be
held on the 12th of January next, and
to preside on that occasion. I need not
say to you how much I am interested
in the object which the conference has
in view and which the contemplated
meeting is called to further. And yet,
much to my regret. I am obliged to say
In response to your invitations that en
gagements already made and an unus
ual pressure of work prevent my at
tending the meeting." #
NOTABLE MEN SPEAK.
Committees were appointed to present
the resolutions adopted early in the day
to President Roosevelt and to Con
gress. The following letter was re
ceived from former President Cleve
land:
submitting the same cither to the per
manent court at The Hague or to a
commission composed of an equal num
ber of persons from each country, of
recognized competence in questions of
international law.
"It is further resolved that our Gov
ernment should enter into treaties to
the same effect as soon as practicable
with other powers."
The committee on resolutions made
the following report,* which was
adopted: -
"â¢Resolved, That it is recommended
to our Government to endeavor to en
ter into j* treaty with Great Britain to
submit to arbitration by the permanent
court at The Hague, or in default of
such submission, by some tribunal
specially constituted for the I case, all
differences which they may fail to ad-

PORTENTOUS RESOLUTION.
"In this age, when men and nations
look hopefully to a future of universal
peace, every endeavor to fasten upon
all countries a code for the amicable
adjustment of International differences
must win the esteem of all mankind."
A message was read from Mayor

and messages of Indorsement were re
ceived from others, including the Gov
ernor of California and John Mitchell,

Ex-Secretary Foster was chosen presi
dent. â¢ He reviewed . the previous arbi
tration movements "and said that no
question can hereafter arise between
the United States and Great Britain
which will more seriously involve the
territorial integrity, the honor ,of the
nation, its vital interests or its inde
pendence than those jvhich already
have been submitted t"b arbitration
without serious Injury to our interests.
He said there never was a time when
the two countries were more closely
united.
President Fester then announced the
committee on resolutions. Among the
members are' Horace Davis of San

Â¦WASHINGTON. Jan. 12.â The Demo
cratic National Committee to-day fur
nished a surprise, selecting St. Louis
as the place for holding the national ,
convention of 1904. The date fixed for
the convention is "Wednesday, July 6.
at 11 o'clock. '
For some hours previous to the meet
ing of the committee there was talfc in
th.e corridors and among Democratic
leaders that the convention in Chicago
might be subject to the influence of a
strong: movement and a newspaper in
fluence in favor of some particular
candidate. Mr. Knapp of the St. Louis
Republic hinted at this in his speech
by saying that the convention if held
at St. Louis would be welcomed by an
absolutely fair press.
The committee meeting covered con
siderable discussion of politics and the
claims of various candidates were ad
vocated by their partisans, but noth
ing like favoring any candidate ap
peared in the committee proceedings.
William J. Bryan, when the commit
tee had concluded its labors, appeared,
but his visit was without anv appar
ent political significance.
St. Louis first was advocated by
Mayor Rolla Wells. A written pro
posal was oresented to the committee
offering $40,000 in cash and the free
use of the Coliseum, a fireproof build
ing with a seating capacity of 13,000.
The Business Men's League guaranteed
hotel accommodations.
The financial proposal of Chicago
was read. It contained a provision
that should the sum of $4*3,000 be ex
hausted in paying the legitftnate ex
penses of the convention the balance
should be returned: also that 3000 tick
ets be placed at the disposal of the lo
cal committee. There were cries for
"James "Hamilton Lewis."
Mr. Lewis declined however, to re
spond, saying that the invitation of
Chicago had been most satisfactorily
presented.
At 4:25 the committee took a short
recess and then went into executive
session, choosing St. Louis as the con
vention city and fixing July 6 as the
date. There were two roll calls to se
lect the city. On the first St. Louis
received 23 votes, Chicago 20 and Xexr
York 6. On the second ballot St. Louis
received 28 and Chicago 21. The date
was fixed as July 6 on motion of Col
onel J. M. Guffey of Pittsburg. s J. G.
Johnson of Kansas suggested* June 7.
The June date was decided to be too
Senator Hanna's re-election is in
striking contrast to his election six
years ago, when, after a most exciting
political contest, he secured only
the requisite number of votes to elect.
73, on joint ballot, the Senate on its
separate ballot having given a major
ity of one vote to Robert L. McKisson
of Cleveland.
To-day Senator Hanna was re
elected by the largest majority ever
given to a candidate for United State*
Senator from Ohio. The House cast
66 votes' for "Mr. Hanna. two Republi
can members being absent, and 21
for* -John H. Clark of Cleveland, the
Democratic candidate, one Democratic
member beins absent. The Senate
cast 29 votes for Mr. Hanna and 4
for Mr. Clark.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. Jan. 12. â The
Ohio Legislature, by special ballot of
the House and Senate, to-day voted to
return M. A. Hanna to the United
States Senate for a second term. The
result will be formally announced at
a joint session at noon to-morrow, a
Joint ballot being: unnecessary by rea
son of Senator Hanna havinj a ma
jority in each branch.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 12. â It Is un
(iTstond that the President will not re
arpoint H. Smith Woolley as assayer
for Bois* City, Idaho. Woolley was
named by the President for the Boise
City assay office last September, a re
cess appointment. Subsequently to the
appointment charges were filed against
him by two editors cf Boise papers. The
charpes were brought to the President's
attention, and as they were of such a
nature and from such a source as to
demand consideration hÂ» directed the
Treasury Department to institute an
investigation of them. The investiga
tion was completed to-day. A brief was
made of the case by the treasury of
ficers and presented to the President.
It is understood that while the brief
does not contain a specific recommen
dation, it practically sustains the
charges against Woolley. No action
will be taken by the President in the
case except that cf a negative charac
ter. This will be in the nature of send
ing the name to the Senate of another
man for the assayership at Boise.
i WASHINGTON. Jan. 12.â A saving
| of at least $400,000 in the cost o-f the
i cement for the Tonto Basin dam is
; promised by the bid for a first lot of
j 1C00 barrels or more received from the
I Pacific Portland Cement Company of
| San Francisco, Cal., which" offers to
I deliver the cement at Globe for %K 80
I per barrel. Two hundred thousand bar
' rels of cement will be used in the con
\ structicn of the dam, and in estlmat
| ins the cost the Government engineers
I learned that cement was costing a min
; ing company in Globe $6 SO per barrel,
I and adding the haul of forty miles over
j the mountain trail to the dam they
j estimated the cement would cost $9 per
I barrel at the site cf the dam. or a total
i of Jl.800,000. Believing it could be man
j ufectured there much cheeper, a ce
â¢ ment mill -was purchased and is to be
! installed. The cement manufacturers
| made a vigorous protest against the
( Government entering: into the manu
! facture of cement, and stated they be
; lieved concessions could be secured
{ from the railroads which would bring
i the price down to $3 45 per barrel de
| iivered at Globe. To test this prcpo
j sition. the department advertised . for
j bids for 1000 barrels or more, the bids
i to be opened to-day.
Up to within a few minutes of the
â¢ hqur for openfnc tnr> bids none had
i been received, and It looked as though
! the manufacturers Intended to ignore
j the matter: but a bid from J. D.
! Spreckels & Bros. Co. of San Fran
| Cisco, selling agents of the Pacific
j Portland Cement Comriany, was re
ceived, offering to furnish 1000 barrels
| at 54 SO per barrel, or in carload lots
j at the same price. This is a reduction
i of 52 per barrel from the original esli
j rr:aie and â¬5 cents.per barrel less than
â¢ the lowest figure heretofore quoted, in
' dicatins that the concessions from the
i railroads have exceeded expectations.
Â¦ The departmf nt can accept or reject
j this bid. or attempt to secure a reduc

; company recently reducod its bid on

division of the land office, a Federal of
ficial, was commenced to-day before
United Statfs Commissioner Shields.
The indictment returned against the
accused and Frederick A. Hyde of San
Francisco charges them with having
obtained' the title to school lands in
California and Oregon by fraudulent
motions and having later bribed the
Washington officials to obtain secret
information gathered by special agents
of the land office concerning the al
leged fraudulent entries. Under the
laws of California and Oregon citizens
have a right to purchase school lands,
set aside by the Federal Government
for that purpose, from the State, pro
viding the purchase is made for resi
dence and improvement, and not for
sale. The two defendants are charged
with having secured applications Jot
the purchase of the lands from citizens
for small sums, giving them to under
stand they were merely selling their
right to purchase lands.
The Government had in attendance a
number of witnesses from Washington
and California. Walter F. Stack, and
Miss M. L. Doyle, formerly clerks in
the office of Mr. Hyde in San Francisco,
testified to methods of making out the
applications for the lands and said that
the applications were signed in blank
and later filled out with the description
of the desired lands.
Miss Dcyle was cross-examined by
Judge Campbell of San Francisco and
admitted that it was the exception and
not the rule to have the applications
signed in blank and she could recall
only a few instances where this had
been done. She also said that she could
not say positively that the persons
whose names were affixed to the af
fidavits did not appear before the no
tary because she was not personally
there when the acknowledgments were
taken.
"Woodford D. Harlan was called to
the stand, but his testimony was not
concluded, an adjournment being taken
until February 2, in order 'to give the
defendant's counsel time to visit San
Francisco and secure some documents
in evidence.

Facts about clothes
v Our cloth is bought direct from the mills. Were we tail-
ors alone, we would be compelled, like all other tailors, to
buy the cloth from jobbers. We buy the cloth from the mills
at the same price the jobbei has to pay them. The jobber, of
course, makes his profit when he sells the goods to the tailor.
The mills give us this privilege because we buy in large quan-
tities for our immense establishment in New York, where
we make ready to wear clothes. There is no other tailor on
' this coast who can buy a yard of cloth direct from the mills
where the cloth is woven. The elimination of the jobber's
profit enables us to save you at least 25 per cent. Our im-
mense volume of business allows us to save you 10 per cent
more. In buying a suit here yon pay at least one-third less
than you can possibly secure {he same goods for from any
other tailor.
We will make you a suit to order from $10 to $45 and
save you from $5 to $10 on your purchase.
Suits satisfactorily made to order for out-bf-toivn cus-
tomers. Write for blank and samples.

uty County Auditor Myron "Wliidden.
County Clerk John P. Cook, Deputy
Assessors Robinson, Miller, . Dexter.
Van de Mark and others were ques
tioned. It was found that the change
was the result of a series of mistakes,
the first of which was made in the
Assessor's office and was afterward car
ried out through the Auditor's and Tax
Collector's offices.
The piece of property over which the
trouble has occurred was the assess
ment of the water in Lake Chabot as
personal property. This property was
discovered by Expert MacJtluilan to
have been overlooked by Assessor Dal

the taxes oa this particular piece of
property. . . ,
The Grand Jury made an investiga
tion to-day of the charge made by As
sessor Henry P. Dalton that the as
sessment of the Contra Costa "Water
Company had been changed on the as
sessment roll, after leaving his hands,
in such a way that the company was
enabled to protest the payment on a
part of its property and pay on the
balance. Mr. Dalton claims that the
company should have had to pay taxes
on all of it3 property or allow it all to
go delinquent. By the change, so that
part could be paid and part protested,
he claims the water company was bene
fited.

OAKLAND. Jan. 12. â The Board of
Police and Fire Commissioners has un
officially decided to appoint Patrolman
Charles E. .Clark as a sergeant of po
lice at the regular meeting Friday.
The question whether a third sergeant
shall be named has not been settled.
Officials of the Police Department who
favor the appointment of three ser
geants argue that a patrol sergeant
can be made as useful as two police
men on beats because he can be sent
on call at a moment's notice and can
cover a wide range of territory in
emergency- cases. It is expected that
further moves will be made by the
Commissioners .looking toward reor
ganization of the police force. '

Altogether there are about 350 vol
umes of poems and about 400 volumes
of novels, many of \ them autograph
numbers, . and many periodicals and
works ' on philosophy, religion, travels,
economics, science and -biography. Â¦
The collection Includes a large num
ber of pamphlets and records of con-,
temporaneous events in the library and
artistic field of the State that are dally
gaining in historical value.
The diary, of Father Pedro Font, a
Spanish priest, who wrote of his trav
els from Monterey^ to San Francisco
in 1775, Is a valued treasure. This diary
was contained in t the famous Cowan
collection, which was purchased and
presented to the university by Collis
P. Huntington. Another set of interest
ing documents are the letters of Gen
eral John A. Sutter, who built Sutter's
Fort. ' The original manuscripts of Bret
Harte's "Heathen Chinese," including a
photograph of Bill Nye, a picture of
Hangtown in '49, a page from the ac
count book of the San Diego Mission
written in 1777, Joaqiiin Miller's
f*Burns" and Edwin Markham's -"The
Man With the Hoe" are also included. in
the collection, besides the works in book
form of each of these writers.
Among the other prominent authors
whose works ' are preserved are Mrs.
Gertrude Atherton, Mary Halleck
Foote, Mark Twain, Helen Hunt Jack
son and Jack London. Librarian Row
ell considers that anything written in
California is ,Calif ornian and therefore
entitled to a place* on the shelves. For
instance, Mrs. Jackson's only Califor
nia work is "Ramona," therefore it is
the. only work by that writer put in
the collection.
BERKELEY, Jan. 12.â To establish
a distinctively Californlan department,
literary and historical, in the library
of the University of California is the
plan that J. C. Rowell, the librarian,
has elaborated with a success that has
encouraged him to further effort. The
purpose is to gather a collection of
manuscripts, published works and gen
eral literary treasures done in Califor
nia by Californian writers. The end in
view is to assemble at the university
a collection that shall be the record of
reference for time to come to attest
California's place in the world of liter
ature. â¢
Librarian Rowell has gathered sev
eral thousand volumes to the depart
ment, additions being of almost daily
occurrence. Among the new gifts to
the Californian section is the original
manuscript of "Two Hearts That Beat
as One*," a short story by the late
Frank Norris and presented by Charles
GÂ» Norris, the author's brother. A vol
ume of poems, "Thoughts," by Ardelia
Cotton Barton, and a novel, "The Lady
of Mark." by Sydney C. Kendall of
Los Aneeles, have been placed on the
shelves.

It is thought by the attending doc
tors that the crisis in Purcell's condi
tion is yet to come. If inflammation of
the brain should develop there will be
but little chance for the patient's sur
vival. There is also a possibility, the
physicians assert, that Purcell may
withstand the shock and his injury and
recover.
That Purceli continues to survive his
Â¦wound is attributed by the surgeons to
his magnificent physique. To-day the
patient received a number of visitors,
including members of his family. He
did not fail to recognize them, and it
was only rarely that he lapsed into a
state of coma. Purcell has thus far
given no reason why he wanted to die.
He regrets his rash act, and noV de
sires to live for the sake of his wife
and four children.

by. raisins a members'" fund of $10,000 and by
rendering valuable assistance in raising $25,000
more, which is known as the young business

the $75,000 secured by the citizens' committee,
make a. total of $110,000, which if eminently
Mtisfactory for the first part of the canvass
and Bivtp assurance that In the near future the
full amount will be secured.
nuring the year lOOt the work of the Young

with marked success, especially when we con
sider the jifrs'.stent and laborious effort on the
part r>f the management to raise $150,000 for
the construction of a new building. â¢ This build

John D. Garfleld, formerly a promi
nent real estate broker of this city,
was probably fatally injured this moTn
itiR in a collision with a milk wagon
while he was riding a bicycle down
Thirteenth avenue, in East Oakland.
According: to Dr. J. L. Mayon, the
attending physician. Garfleld suffered
a fracture of the skull, with the. ex
ternal evidence indicating that the In-
Jury extended to the base of the brain,
causing a severe Internal hemorrhage.
Garfleld left his residence, 1805 Thir
teenth street, on his bicycle only a few
minute's before the accident occurred
at 7 o'clock. He was pedaling rapidly
down a grade, when the milk team
turned into the street from a cross
thoroughfare. Neither the. driver nor
the wheelman had time to avert a col
lision. Garfleld was thrown heavily
over the handlebars and struck the
street on his head.
Passing pedestrians hastened to the
senseless man's assistance. He was
recognized and was removed as quickly
as' possible to his residence. Dr. Mayon
was called and found his patient In a
very critical condition.
There were times when the injured
man regained consciousness for a mo
ment, but J he lapsed into" a comatose
state and gave every evidence of a very
serious brain lesion.

PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 12.â An im
portant decision rendered in the Cir

to corporations whose stock is heavily
watered. The â¢ court holds as a prin
ciple of law; in such cases thai the
original subscribers forstock must pay
for the same in money or property, of
equivalent value, and that in case an
attempt is' made to pay the subscrip
tion for stock in Droperty palpably of
less value, than tire par 'value of the
stock, a creditor can recover the differ
ence between the actual value and that
represented.
This was a suit brought" by William
McBeath, as trustee in bankruptcy, to
recover such difference upon the ground
that when the defendants, Banfleld.aud
Rand, bought ah interest in the, Kaup

was turned, Into a corporation, they j
paid but $2000 each* for, subscriptions of

Burke appeared to know' what was

a definite showing as to who the real
projectors of the new enterprise are,
but he said the company would have
electrical power to sell. With con
siderable^reserve the Southern Pacific
attorney said that no electric railroad
scheme was contemplated by his com
pany at present, but that there was no
telling what thev future might bring
forth. He said that men of capital
realized that Stockton was destined to
become a great manufacturing cen
ter and that it would need immense
electric power. His company pur
posed to be on the ground early. It
! would brine some of its power afar,
but would manufacture the most of it
in Stockton. This" city was to be the

The resignation of Manager Babcock
was because of his ill health and be
cause of his desire,. after a season of
rest and recuperation, to devote his en
tire time to his own enterprises. He
remains a director in Spreckels Broth
ers' Commercial Company.. Babcock
has been- so closely identified with San
Diego and Coronado since before the
beginning of the boom of 1887-88 that
he is known to about every one to
whom either San Diego or Coronado is
known. Clayton, who becomes man
aging director, has been the manager
of the various transportation'com
panies for the past several years and
as such has become known to most of
the people on both sides of the bay.
His successful management of those
companies gives a direel and positive
evidence of his ability to make a suc
cess of the management of other com
panies. Babcoek left yesterday morn
ing, accompanied, by Mrs. Babcock, on
his health hurfting trip.

jor General Egerton, commanding the
Komaliland expeditionary force. King
Edward's expression of satisfaction
over the result of the engagement in
Somaliland between the British and
the forces of the Mullah, which result
ed in the defeat of the latter,, who left
1000 men killed. His Majesty ex
presses regret over the losses of of
ficers and men of General Egerton's
command.
Major Lecke. a Canadian officer,
who has just returned an invalid from
Somaliland, when interviewed said the
defeat was the beginning of the end of
the power of the Mullah, whose forces
are now scattered.
At 9:30 this evening G. T. Battelle of
Oakland, roadmaster of this division
of the Southern Pacific, appeared on
the scene with a force of men and gath
ered iip/the frogs and crossings that
the interurban intended to lay and re
moved them to the yards of his com
pany. President James W. Rea of the
interurban was present and protested.
Rea sent one of his men to get him a
revolver, but when it arrived the
Southern Pacific men had removed the
tracks. Rea, however, placed Battelle
under arrest and took him to the City
Prison. Later Battelle was charged
with grand larceny in stealing $2000
worth of material from Rea. Battelle
was released on $2000 bail, furnished by
P^iul Shoup and J. L. Jackson. :
Tlea declares if he had had a gun
he would not have allowed the rail
road company to remove the material.
Battelle states that the interurban
had a ''force of 200 men secreted In the
neighborhood and intended to put in
the crossine at midnight, stealing a
march on the Southern Pacific. They
objected to this : mode of doing things,
wanting their own engineers to super
intend it.
Rea professes not to know what the
trouble is about ti and thinks that the
rival- electric roads are causing the
trouble. The interurban has a fran
chise along the street
SAN JOSE, Jan. 12.â A new obtruc
tion to the interurban electri(^ail\vay
entrance to this city developed to-day
in the Southern Pacific Company. In
building its road the interurban left
the crossing over the Southern Pacific
line at San Carlos street to the last.
To-day they intended to put in the
crossing, but when the, force appeared
on the ground it was found that 'the
Southern Pacific objected. A heavy
freight engine and two cars took up a
position on the railroad track where it
crosses San Carlos street to prevent the
interurban men from working. The en
gine and cars remained right pver the
crossing, and when a team approached
woujd move away to give a clear cross
ing and then return. To-night another
crew, and engine are keeping vigil at
the point to see that the interurban
company does not steal a march on

LIVERPOOL, Jan. 12.â An inter
esting statement in connection with
the strategic value of the Trans-Si
berian Railway was made to-day by
Fulford Bush, a member of a British
mercantile firm at Newchwang. Ad
dressing the Liverpool Chamber of
Commerce, Mr. Bush, after covering
the question of the light construction
of the railway and the probability of
the line being blocked if subjected to
heav# military traffic, said that his
own observations, coupled with trust
worthy native information, convinced
him 'that at least 200 Japanese mili
tary engineers, disguised as Chinese
coolies, barbers and other menials,
had already been distributed at points
along the railroad and that it would
not be a fortnight after the declara
tion of war before the line would be
blown up at a dozen places.

ROME, Jan. 12.â Signor Monaco, the

no representative of that country in
Italy, has sent direct a letter from the
Emperor of Korea to King Victor Em

interpose his good offices with whom or
in whatever quarters he may think best
for the purpose of helping Korea in the
difficult position in which she is placed
by the rivalry between Japanese and
Russian interests.

the Japanese Minister, in an interview
to-day, declared that if war should
come he believed it would be a pro
longed on*, u was difficult now to see
how :t could be decisive, he sail, con
sidered solely from a military point of
view. "The majority of the people of
Russia." added the Minister, "and many
perpons abroad, have underestimated
Japans strength, the idea prevailing in
well-informed quarters that Japan
.would be unable to put more than 200,
000 soldiers In the field. This idea is en
tirely erroneous."
Minister Kurino said he still was
hnppful of peace, but was confident that
if necessary the Japanese army of
in^re than 600.000 men would give a
pood account of itself and do credit to
Japan's mijitary system and system of
compulsory education. He pointed out
that Japan's coast defenses were so

admitted ttat even a coalition of the
powers .wbuld be unable to effect a
landing on Japanese soil.

TOKIO, Jan. 12.â In the presence of
the Mikado himself the final conference
to decide on the answer to Russia
drawn up at yesterday's meeting of the
Cabinet and veteran statesmen was
held to-day. Previous to the council
Admiral Yamamoto in behalf of Pre
mier Katsura, who Is indisposed, had a
private audience with the Emperor. Mr.
Kornura, the Foreign Minister, and
>Iar<juis Ito also conferred privately.
At the general conference aU_ mem
bers of the Cabinet were present, along
with Marquis Ito, Marquis Yamagata,
Count Matsukata and Marquis Saionjl.
While the result of the conference is
rot positively known, it is stated that
the response drafted yesterday was ap
proved and ordered delivered to Baron
de Rosen, the Russian Minister. The
Bwwer, which is believed to partake of
thÂ«? nature of an ultimatum, is regarded
as the final step in the negotiations.
Public interest is at fever heat and de
velopments are anxiously awaited.
According to high authorities Japan
really desires China for the present to
traintain a strict neutrality in the
e.vnt of war. Th*> attitude of the Gov-
Pinment on that point might experience
a sudden change, however, should the
army and navy prove unequal to the
task of defeating Russia., If the tide
of war should begin to how against
Japan, threatening disaster to the em
pire, it is probable that heroic efforts
would be made to draw China into the
struggle.

tents Are Withheld.
5IIKAIX) AT COUNCIL.
The German newspapers have no spe
cial correspondents in the Far East and
rely for news either on outside agen
cies or on official sources here. Since
the official sources consistently aver
that war is wholiy out ot the question,
not a single newspaper in Germany, so
far as the correspondent has seen, re
gards war as likely.
The German Foreign Office is well in
formed, especially from the Russian
side, and it may be inferred that the
positive official optimism here Is de
rived from knowledge that Russia will
not permit war to break out.
BERLIN, Jan. 12.â The German For
eign Office holds to the opinion that
war in the Far East is still highly im
probable. Beyond this the official state
ments do not go. Unofficial opinion,
especially that of the newspapers, re
gards the statements telegraphed from
the Far East of "extreme tension as
part of a great diplomatic game des
tined to make Russia believe that moTe
concessions must be made or Japan will
attack. ' -
Foreign Office Still Declares That War
Is Improbable. â¢

PORT ARTHUR, Jan. 12.â It is re
ported here that owing to threatening
news received from KoTea the com
manding officer of the Seventh Russian
Brigade has gone to theTalu, Rlver (
to select temporary camps and effect
a concentration of troops.
Owing to the apprehensions of a dar
ing dash on the part of the Japanese
at Port Arthur the authorities here
have taken extraordinary precautions
in and about the town and along the
whole line of the Manchurian Railroad.
Rumors were circulated some time
ago that the Japanese intended to take
advantage of the festivities incident to
the Russian Christmas and surprise
the warships here. Consequently a vig
ilant watch was kept night and day.
The whole Russian fleet is now in
fighting trim. '

Spooner declared that the stage for
the recognition* of claims on the part
of Colombia .had passed and that the
only way to accomplish the purpose
sought \ was through the republic of
Pa'nama." ' It' would' be entirely proper
Tor the United. States to offer Its good
offices as'between Colombia and* Pan
ama. He made an argument for delay
in such declaration as the resolution
contemplated, saying that . we did not
even know what Colombia wanted. The
Senate could not afford to act Upon
newspaper reports. The resolution was
premature. . Â¦ v ;- -
Taking up Spooner's suggestion of
offering srood offices on the part of the
United States as between Panama and
Colombia Hale Indorsed It. saying that
he would-be willing not only to do that,
but to guarantee any pledge of con
firmation that Panama might make.
Further consideration of the resolu
tion was deferred until to-morrow, with
the understanding that the question
shall be taken,, up after the disposal
of the Carmack resolution for investi
gation of the affairs of the Postofflce
Department.
The Senate then at 5:15 adjourned.
A long debate over cloture* followed,
during which Aldrich expressed the
opinion that the peculiar conditions at
present existing call for prompt action.
He based his argument on the ground
that .tjÂ»e resolution Is _ calculated to
cause a misunderstanding in Colombia.
Hepburn then suggested that the
whole matter should be deferred until
there had been a definite statement of
claims, as under the present circum
stances it would be difficult to deter

Teller contended that the course pro
posed in the Bacon resolution was per
fectly proper. It was only a sugges
tion, and all must admit the right of
the Senate to make such. a suggestion.
As to Foraker's statement that no
wrong had been done in Panama, Teller
said that he would refer him to the
declarations of Hoar as made by him
In the Senate last month.
Teller took issue with Spoorier on his
position that our intervention in the
Panama affair was not an act of war,
and said if it was not such an act
this circumstance was due to' Colom

surprise that Senators should predict
war at a time so critical. Such utter
ances were very dangerous, and if
"there was not war between the United
States and Colombia it would not be
the fault of some gentlemen here at
home."
lie considered that the troops of. the
United States were where they ought

in 1900, 1901 and 1902 the United States
had followed the same course as at

to Panama to prevent attacks on either

protect American interests.

WASHINGTON; Jan. 12.â For over
five hours to-day the Senate* debated
the Panama Question, and it was still
under consideration when the Senate
adjourned. Thf discussion arose over
a resolution looking to the arbitration
of Colombia's claims on account of the
Panama revolution. It was introduced
early In the day by Bacon and was met
promptly by a motion on the part of
Lodge to table it.
This motion aroused the feeling of
Senators on the Democratic side, who
construed the motion as intended to
cut off debate, and they said they would
debate the Panama question on some
other resolution If not on this. Finally
Lodge consented to withdraw his mo
tion, and the discussion proceeded
throughout the day, with the under
standing that it should be renewed
again to-morrow.
Republican Senators in their speeches
referred to the resolution as a confes
sion of wrong on the part of the United
States, and expressed the opinion that
any agitation of the question at this
time would give undue encouragement
to the people of Colombia and misrep
resent the attitude of this country.
Bacon disavowed any such intention
and said that he accepted the revolu
tion as an accomplished fact.
A ready response to this pronounce
ment came from Hale, and during the
course of the debate he and Bacon
practically agreed on a declaration,
which Hale intimated he would offer
to-morrow in the Senate. Other Repub
lican Senators indicated an unwilling
ness to accept any measure looking to
an Interference with executive negotia
tions, while the Democratic Senators
also intimated objections on other
grounds.

Driggs was convicted of . accepting

the purchase of the automatic cashiers
from the Brandt-Dent Company for
the Postofflce Department., There will

The statute under which Driggs was

of office accepts compensation for pro
curing a contract between the United

maximum penalty for the crime is two

Driggs' fine was paid immediately- after
sentence was pronounced, Driggs and
his attorney saying that they Indorsed
the statement by th^e court that an
honorable man would have no desire to
retain moneys secured under such cir
cumstances. Driggs was not taken to

The phenomenon was accompanied by
a fall of snow, while a pall of sable
clouds enveloped all thoroughfares and
buildings. Street car and wagon traffic
was considerably hampered. Even
greater difficulty was encountered by
the throngs of pedestrians, who strug
gled as best they could along the slip
pery walks in the absence of street

CHICAGO, Jan. 12.â Hundreds of pas
sengers on incoming trains here to-day
were startled by a sudden plunge into
midnight darkness. The transition from
broad daylight seemed immediate and
complete, as if the rush was into a tun

extended in a circle from the center of
the city, the radius being a distance o^
several miles. The duration was over
an hour. Unusual atmospheric condi
tions aggravated by smoke were gen
erally accepted as the cause.
Minister Conger requested the Chi

The most unfortunate of all the ex

report says, are the poor transporta-,

TRANSPORTATION FAULTY.
The next largest field of production
is undoubtedly that of Southeastern
Alaska, where "quartz mining has been
carried on many years, and where
there are established some of the larg
est stampmills in the world. The Ju
neau district, which includes, Silver
Bow Basin and Douglass Island and the
Treadwell mines, has long been noted
for its output, and in recent years the
Ketchikan district has been rapidly
coming to the ftfmt. The latter in
cludes the Prince of Wales Island, Re
"vlUagegido Island and many smaller
ones, as well as a part of the main
land.
The third field; in point of produc
tion at the present time, but one which
has potential possibilities in the fu
ture, is what is generally termed- the
Yukon district. It may be described as
extending from the International boun
dary line, between Alaska and the Brit
ish territory. * westerly as far as the
Tanana River, a distance of 500 or, 600
miles, and from the, Yukon River
(which at one point touches. the Arctic
Circle) southwardly to Menlasta Pass.
QUARTZ MINES FLOURISH.
The production of gold in Alaska,
with some fluctuation, has steadily in
creased since 1898, when it amounted
to onTy $2,51T,121.^ In. 1902 it reached
the sum of $8,345,800. Silver has been
produced only in limited quantities' and
other mineral products, while reported,
have not yet been extensively exploited.
The largest amount of gold . has un
doubtedly come from Seward Penin
sula, of which Nome is the principal
settlement. In, the immediate vicinity
of this city are found deposits of the
richest character, and which have as
yet been but partially worked. The'
entire territory for several miles around
has been taken up and staked off. In
other sections of the peninsula, notabiy
in the Council City district, are found
large areas of low grade earth, which,
is now being handled ' with modern
methods with great profit. Nome also
has cheap transportation. Provisions
are laid down there as cheap as they
can be purchased in Seattle, Portland
or San Francisco plus an ocean freight
rate with strong competition. The min
ers there have that advantage over
those in the distant Interior. The re
sult of that advantage is the develop
ment of large low grade ground
throughout the Seward Peninsula.
Moreover, by reason of cheap freights
modern heavy machinery has been
brought in, pumping stations erected
and all modern devices adopted to pro
duce gold economically and in large
quantities. It was expected that nearly
$5,000,000 in value of this metal would
be shipped from Nome the present sea
son.
GOLD OUTPUT GROWS.
The report says that the great wealth
to be derived In the herring, cod arid
halibut fisheries of Alaska is little com
prehended, because few have sought it.
The committee predicts that the annual
catch of cod can be made to exceed
that of Newfoundland or any other
part of the world. Whether the climatic
conditions of the region, which militate
against the successful curing of flsh,
can be overcome has not been fully de
termined.
A statement of the receipts and ex
penditures of the general Government
since Alaska became part of the' United
States shows a^roflt to the Government
of nearly $1,000,000. The report says
that in 1902 the output of canned
salmon from Alaska was 2,631,320 cases,
valued at about $8,K)00,000, from which
the Government derived a revenue of
$105,255. The committee recommends
that some provision be made for propa
gating salmon in sufficient quantities
to insure the permanency of the sup
ply. The present law requiring the es
tablishment of a hatchery by each com
pany and the planting of ten red salmon
for each red salmon caught, the report
says, cannot be enforced without great
and disproportionate expense â an ex
pense greater than the profits of the
business will warrant. It is suggested
that hatcheries., be established by the
â¢general Government at as many places
as may be f6und necessary, the greater
expense to be laid on those in the
salmon industry, in proportion to the
amount of the respective product of
each concern.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.â Senator
Beveridge, from the Committee on Ter
ritories, introduced in the Senate \to
day the report of a sub-committee, con
sisting of Senators Dillingham, Burn
ham, Nelson and Patterson, which vis
ited Alaska during the last summer
and made a thorough investigation of
existing conditions, resources and leg
islative needs of the Territory. .The
committee visited Metlakatla, Ketchi
kan, Fort Wrangel, Juneau, Douglass
Island and then the Treadwell mines,
Haines Mission, where the Government
is now establishing a military po3t;
Skagway, White Pass, Lake Lebarge,
Lewes River, Dawes, St. Michael, Eagle
City, Fort Yukon, Circle City. Ram
part, Fort Gibson, Nome, St. Paul Isl
and, the headquarters of the sealing
industry; Dutch Harbor, Unalaska.
Karluk, Kodiak, Valdez and Sitka. As
a result of the inquiries the committee
has made many recommendations tp
Congress. . .â¢ . ;
RECEIPTS FROM ALASKA.
"The business of Alaska is carried
on by citizens of 'the United .States.
It.' Is claimed by them to be now a
'white man's country.' To all Intents
and purposes such is the fact. In every
contest for gain the white man has
been the gainer. . Poverty extreme and
pitiable prevails among the natives
and develop^ their tendency to dis
ease. Death is ever present at their
doors. Justice ' and 'humanity alike
demand legislation for their relief."
The necessity, pf rendering . some
support to the native population is
felt by the cpmmittee, which s'ays. of
these Esquimaux and India* 13 - .
"Hunters by nature and habit, and
able and willing before the influx of
the whites to care for themselves, they
are." through the gaxne- laws, . who.lly
deprived of their chief means of main
tenance. Why they should be depriv
ed of their immemorial right to hunt
at, will passes the comprehension- of
the committee. The first ' measure
for the relief of the natives, particu
larly the Esquimaux a + nd Aleuts, should
be the absolute repeal of thi game
laws in so far as their 'provisions pre
vent ; hunting "and trapping by abor
igines and natives and the sale of
skins so taken. The 'deplorable con
dition of these classes, is , such as <to
demand other and further relief at
the hands of Congress-
PLEA FOR THE NATIVES.
The recommendation of; the commit
tee regarding the policy of the Govera
ment on the f ur, seal islands [ in, Alaska
provides that.ajl killing be t stopped next
season and. that the Government ne-.
gotiate with Great Britain, Japan and
Russia for protection of the herd from
pelagic sealing, j If- negotiations fail,
the Government shquld reduce the fe
male herd to. 10,000/ '
5 It is recommended that the Govern^
ment improve the hai-bor at St. Michael
in order to permit unobstructed pas
sage to the mouth of the Yukon;
also that improvements be made at the
mouth of the Snake River, in order to
permit the safe landing of passengers
to Nome. .
Alaska is divided into three Judicial
districts. The committee says that on
account of the great size of these dis
tricts and poor transportation, facilir
ties it is practically impossible in some
sections to get justice. A fourth judicial
district is recommended.
The committee says the general opin
ion among all classes is, that Alaska
should be represented by a delegate in
Congress. In a number of sections of
Alaska the committee encountered ag
itation for. the establishment terri
torial government and the election of
an assembly. This is not recommended
by the committee, however, as from the
best data it obtained ihe\ cpmmltt'ee be
lieves the permanent white population
of- Alaska to-day will not exceed 20,000.

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets by thus
relieving the stomach of its work enable
that organ to 'rest and recuperate and
regain its- health and strength. The
process is perfectly natural and plain.
Nature will heal the stomach Just as
she heals a wound or a broken limb if
she Is not interfered with and is per-
mitted to do her work In her own way.
All interference is prevented by Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Yon Arc Certain to tos^ If You^ At-
tempt the tse of, Force and VJolence.
You cannot' force -your, stomach to :db
work that it Is unable and unwilling to!
do. It has been tried time and. 'again, ]
with always the same result Th^tftom- j
ach is a srood and faithful servant, but Â¦
when pushed beyond the lfmlt it rebels.
Some stomachs will stand much more
abuse than others, but every Stomach ]
has its limit, and when that flmit is
reached it ig a very dangerous jarid un-
wise proceeding to attempt to. force it
Into doing further work. The, 'sensible
and reasonable course is to employ a
substitute % to carry on the work of di-
grestlon and give the stomach an op-
portunity tf* recuperate and regain, its
lost strength.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets ''"are the
only perfect substitute tq take up -and
carry on the work of tlrCd, worn-out
Btomachs. They are natural' and: 1 easy
in their work and cause no disturbance
In the digestive organs. They contain
all the essential elements >that make up
the gastric juice and other digestive
fluids, and will digest any food that a
strong, healthy stomach will, and do It
In the same time and in*the same way.
They work independently of surround-
ing conditions, and the fact. that the
stomach is weak or diseased does not
influence them at all in their useful and
effective work. Thev wilt digest food
jupt as well in a glass Jar or bottle as
they will in a stomach. You can see
that for yourself .by putting one of
them Inti a jar with a square meal and
some .water to enable It to work.

questions that 'will be up for, consider

sympathetic chords: among the dele

FACE SERIOUS SITUATIONS.
At the close of the Governor's address
President Springer introduced Mayor
"Williams, who extended a welcome in
behalf of the city ot Portland.
The organization by you of an Independent
packers' association, having in view the erec
tion of pncklnjr establishments on the Atlantic
and Pacific seaboards for the export trade is a
curative step and one that commends Itself to
the intelligence, of the country.
If with this decline In prices of stock on
foot there was a corresponding decline in the
manufactured products there might be some
compensation for this condition. But the fact
In. the output of the packing. houses has not
percentlbly declined and prices have uni
formly remained about the same. If they have
not In some Instances gone to a higher level.
It Is needless for. me to suggest to you the
source of these conditions. They are brought
about by the manipulations of the leading
packlng-houscA of the country.
What is the practical remedy for the con
ditions which unfavorably. affect the livestock
Industry of the country?
There Is no excuse for conditions which
exist to-day Injuriously affecting the livestock
industry of the , country. In one short year,
and during an era Â¦ of unprecedented pros
perity, there has been a falling off In the
prices of livestock of nearly 50 per cent,
aggregating a loss to the industry of $805,
000,000â$6*0.000,000 of which falls upon the
raiser of cattle. $120,000,000 upon the raiser
of sheep and f63.0O0.C0O upon the raiser of.
hogs. This immense sum represents nearly
a fourth of the total value of the livestock
of the United States
tunity is afforded them to ejitertain you as
their distinguished guests. v
I congratulate you that you have made your
selves felt and heard; that even the doors of
the august Congress of the United States have
been permitted to swing- ajar so that your
gentle voices might be permitted to enter In
and stir up your servants there, and I pre
dict for you and thrown your efforts for the
people still further and more attentive au
dlehees than you have yet had at the hands
of the powers that be
Directly due to your efforts is the Federal
law which provides for the Federal Inspection
of Interstate ehipments of livestock whereby
stockmen are relieved of the necessity of hav
ing to pay a fee at every State line crossed
while en route. Through the instrumentality
of this law a saving Is made to the industry
which you represent of at least 1100,000 per
annum.
The delegates to both conventions
were entertained to-night by the peo
ple of Portland at a reception given in
the* halls of the Commercial Club.
; ' The joint - convention was called to
order a little after 10 o'clock, and Presi
dent Jc-hn \W. -'-. Springer- of tlfe National
Livestock Association, in a; few:appro
priate words, welcomed ; the largoi audi
ence that crowded the Baker Theater
to the doors, - and introduced' Governor

Chamberlain's address, which was en
thusiastically received by the delegates,^
was in part as follows: ."
Gentlemen: I take great pleasure in ex
tending to you. on behalf of the people of the
State, a most cordial welcome. Representing
as Â¦ you do Interests Â¦ of great magnitude : and

The livestock convention will begin
its work proper to-morrow morning
and three days will be devoted to earn
est consideration of many questions of
vital importance. Some politics Is be
ing indulged in relative to the coming
election of officers for this organization,
but it Is generally believed that Francis
J. Hagenbarth of Idaho. will; be chosen
to succeed President Joseph W.
Springer of Denver. ' i ";.-"â¢. ; -
The morning session was devoted en
tirely to a programme of .entertain
ment, including music and addresses of
welcome and responses. In the after
noon the wool erowers met alone and
completed the business of their meet-
Ing. Common interests of the wool
grower and the manufacturer were
discussed. The condition of the mutton
sheep market was thoroughly presented
by representatives of the markets.
Resolutions were adopted favoring leg
islation that the sheep men deem to
be beneficial and necessary to their in
dustry and officers for the ensuing year
were elected. Senator F. E. Warren
of Wyoming was re-elected president.
The convention decided to meet in cqn
junction with the livestock men next
year at such place. as the latter con
vention may decide upon.
San Jose, Cal., appears to be in the
lead for the next convention of the two
organizations, though Denver has
strong backing. An effort is being
made to have the convention decide
upon a permanent meeting place, where
all succeeding conventions may be held.
It is generally conceded that , should
this motion prevail Denver will be se
lected as, the permanent headquarters.
WELCOMED TO OREGON. 7
PORTLAND, Jan. 12.â The delegates
to the National Wool Growers' and Na
tional Livestock Convention met in
joint session to-day and the two big
organizations were heartily welcomed
to Oregon and Portland by represen
tative men of the State and city. The
Livestock Association formally opened
its annual meeting and the wool grow
ers, after a lengthy business session in
the afternoon, adjourned sine die. More
than a thousand delegates to the' two
conventions from every section of the
United States thronged the Baker The
ater from pit. to gallery. The proceed
ings were frequently interrupted with
bursts of applause in response to ad
dresses upon questions of vital inter
est to the two organizations. Sheep
men and cattle raisers met upon com
mon ground with common interests at
heart and discussed ways' and means
of securing mutual benefits.
SIOUX CITY. Iowa, Jan. 12. â Al
bert J. Bolk3, who cut his wife's
throat with a pocket knife and then
ended his own life, was well known
here. A year ago when Bolks brought
his family from his thousand-acre
farm in Sioux City, Iowa, to Sioux
City to give his children educational
advantages, he received a letter de
manding $1000 from him. The writer
threatened to burn down the hand
some buildings on the Bolks farm un
less the money was left at a certain
place by a specified time. Although
the officers made a vigorous search
for the blackmailer no trace of him
was found. This incident coming on
the heels of trouble in the Dutch col
ony ot Sioux County over religious
matters upset Bolks greatly and he
worried continually about it. He lat
er got to complaining of alleged ene
mies and persecutors. Bolks leaves
land in Sioux County worth $100,000
and considerable property in Sioux
City, having purchased a home here
near Morningside College, to which
the family expected to return in the
spring. It is said that continued dis
putes over religion provoked by his
refusal to join his wife's church, the
Dutch Reformed, furnished the rea
son for moving his family* from his
ranch.

Short addresses were made relative
to mutton sheep as viewed from the
leading markets by A. C. Halliwell of
Chicago, W. H. Weeks of Kansas City
and M. B. Irwin of St. Joseph. Mo. The
expression , of opinion .was, that .while
the mutton iharket has not been as
good a one .during the past year as
mighUhave been desired, the pros
pects for .this year are flattering.
- Following these talks T. D. Fosney,
president! of the Arizona Wool Grow
ers'-'Association; and one of the fram
era of the so-called : ; "shoddy bill,"
took occasion to give the sheep men's
side of the matter. He denied that
the intention of the measure was to
prevent â¢ the " manufacture of. mixed
goods. V The . intention,' â he said, was to
secure, the/ , manufacture of honest
goods of genuine material. '
Jerry Simpson of Â¦ New Mexico was

dress,, in -.which he ! reviewed some ! of
his: experiences, in the. development of

there." A number of resolutions "were

these was : .one favoring the^appoint
ment : of r committees " of - three ; : from

Harding's address was followed by
a talk on the subject, "Facts About
Shoddy," by â¢ Secretary John : N. Mc-
Pherson of the Wool Manufacturers*
Association. He assured, the wool
growers that Â¦ the association . he rep
resented was deeply interested in see
ing the sheep industry of this coun

cause* they must depend upon this
supply for their business.
At the of the afternoon
session C. H. Harding, president of the
National Association of Woolen Man
ufacturers, gave an extensive and com
prehensive address on the subject,
"Matters of Mutual Interest to Wool
Growers and Woolen Manufacturers."
Hft discftssed the subject under two
headings: The first was that of leg
islation and the second that of mar
keting.
Under the first heading he stated
that the proposed French. treaty deals
a body .blow, at American manufac
turers of hosiery and is of such disas
trous character that it must be op
posed in : . self-defense., The proposed
North American treaty to reduce the
tariff on wool was not fostered by the
Manufacturers' Association. In rela
tion to the"mixed goods" bill, Hard
ing pointed'out features of the meas
ure which he thought were not to the
interest, of the producers or growers
of . wool. . i
With reference to the wool market
of this country, the speaker thought
that a satisfactory classification could
be made at the time of clipping which
would make it possible for the manu
facturer to,- buy in large lots direct
from the producer and at the same
time be sure of getting the desired

Ripley said that Atchison engineers
are working on plans for the extension
of a line from San Francisco to Eu

chased^ by a syndicate in behalf of the
Atchison.
"Whatever is eventually done," said
Mr. Ripley, "it can be stated definitely
that an agreement will not include any
general trackage clause giving the
Kock Island the use of any line to the
Pacific Coast. If the plan is approved
it may take the form of an interchange
of traffic at the junction of our Abo

ment for the use of the Rock Island
line to Kansas City or Dodge City,
temporarily, until the cut-off has been
extended to a junction with our Pecos

NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â E. P. Kipley,
president of the Santa Fe Railroad, said
to-day that while no agreement had
been made with the Rock Island for a
trackage arrangement, a plan has been
considered and has not been abandoned.
Williams declared that last October
he reported to Mayor Harrison that
not one of the theaters in Chicago was
complying with the ordinances. The
Mayor turned over his report to the
Council, which turned it over to a com
mittee, and nothing was done.
Coroner Traeger demanded to know
if there was anybody in the office of
the Building Commissioner whose busi
ness it was to see whether the inspec
tors did their duty. Mr. Williams* re
ply was: "Once in a while I have
done 30." rzs~-'
Neither he nor any member of his
department, so far as known, had any
knowledge as to whether automatic
sprinklers had been placed in the thea

CHICAGO, Jan. 12.â Euilding Com
missioner Williams was the chief wit
ness to-day in the inquest over the
victims of the Iroquoi3 Theater fire.
He testified that during the construc
tion of the building he had visited it
but once, that time beins about two
weeks prior to the opening of -the thea
ter on November 23. " He said that at
that time the structural part of the
building was completed, but that little
things which go to finish were not in
place. He had never looked at the
plans for the building except on one
occasion. He admitted that he allowed
the builders to place pine Joists in cer
tain places beneath the stage instead
of steel supports, as called for by the
building ordinances.
Commissioner Williams admitted that
his department had passed on the ar
rangement vt exits, passageways and
aisles; that the department knew that
the ordinance required an exit to be
plainly marked by a sign, and* that ap
pliances for the extinguishment of fire
be placed in theaters, and then said
that Â«.!?.*Â» -^cc.-" had never been in
formed by the inspectors that none of
these requirements had been fully met
and he did not know before the theater
burned whether they had been com
plied with or not. When asked by the
Coroner who assumed the responsibil
ity, he admitted that he, as head of
the department, would be compelled to
assume it.

working* as a stevedore at San Pedro, j
Chief Elton to-day compelled Win
ters to repay $150 which he had se
cured from F. B. Brown. Brown
says that Winters told him to plunge
iinto a sump hole and that he would
cure him. * When the police caught
Brown he was preparing to try the
"cure" and it would "have meant cer
tain death to him. Winters paid back
Brown's money to escape arrest.

to his collection of money and jew

spired.
At the Coroner's inquest held to
day it was shown that Bolks' insan
ity was aggravated by the teachings
of an alleged "evangelist" named C.
H. Winters, who has been conducting
so-called religious meetings in this
city for several weeks. Bolks' mind,
owing to long illness, was in such a
receptive condition that when Winters
told him he could cure him by divine
power if he would pray constantly
Bolks believed him. For more than
a week during his every waking mo
ment Bolks was constantly muttering
prayers and on two occasions he
awakened his family for prayer, tell
ing them that Winters had command}
ed it- How much he paid Winters is
not known, but if he was treated like
some other victims he paid well for
Winters' "services."
LOS AXGELES, Jan. 12.â A. J. Bolks,
a well-to-do farmer of Sioux City, Iowa,
murdered his wife in a boarding-house
at â¬616 Thorne street, this city, early
this morning by cutting her throat with
a pocket knife. He % then turned the
weapon on himself and ended his own
life. The nftirder was committed in
the presence of their four-year-old son,
who was awakened by the sounds of
the struggle, and gave the alarm.
Bolks is supposed to have been tem
porarily deranged over religious mat
ters and to have committed the crime
in a moment of irresponsibility. He
had been acting queerly for some time,
and on one occasion recently kept his
family up all night. praying. On that
occasion he exhibited a revolver and
threatened to take their lives.
Bolks came to Los Angeles from
Sioux City about two weeks ago, ac
companied by his nine-year-old son.
and was fallowed a short time later by
his wife and other members of his
family. He was apparently possessed
of considerable means and had intended
to remain here with his family during
the winter.

There are thousands of cheerless homes I
Sn this country filled with discontent and !
unhappiness. lacking in love and coxa- j
panionship through the sexual -weakness J
and physical impairment of a man whose j
years do not justify such a condition. In- j
discretions, abuses and recklessness
often cause a temporary cessation ot vi- 1
tal power that Instantly yields to the j
â¢wonderful treatment discovered by the j
great specialist. Dr. 1L C Raynor. of De- J
troit. Michigan. It has remained for this
great physician to discover that sexual
weakness and similar, troubles can be
cured and in remarkable short spaces of
time. This treatment does not ruin the
stomach, adding the miseries such Injury
entails, but it is a new treatment that
easily and quickly restores youthful
vijcor to men as old as S5.
The discovery is beyond doubt thÂ«
most scientific and comprehensive that
our attention has ever been called to.
From all sides we hear private reports of
cures in stubborn cases of sexual weak-
ness, enlargement of the prostate, varl-
eocele. spermatorrhea. lost manhood, im- j
potency, emissions, prematurity, shrunk-
en organs, lack of virile power, bashful-
ness and tixnidrty and like unnatural con-
ditions. It does this without appliances,
vacuum pumps, electric belts or any-
thing of that kind.
Satisfactory results are produced In a
day's use and a perfect cure In a short
time, regardless of ege or the cause of
vour condition.
" The lucky discoverer simply desires to
eet In touch with all men who can make
use of such a treatment. They should
address him in confidence. Dr. H. C. Ray-

LAST month an attempt was made by a fanatic of
the Jewish, Zionist movement to take the life of
Dr. Max Nordau. 'The would-be assassin gave as
the reason for his deed an alleged attempt of Dr. Npr
Â«lau and Dr. Herzl to sway the Zionistic sentiment
for a reunited Judea into support of a proposed colony
for Jews- on the east coast of Africa. In striking down
the heads of this plot, as the disordered brain of the
fanatic conceived^ it to be, the self-appointed murderer
felt that he would be saving the Hebraic dream of; a"
rebuilded temple and a restored ark of the covenant
from disruption at the hands of false prophets.
This attempt at the destruction of the man who has
been at the forefront of the Zionist movement from the
moment of its conception by Theodore Herzl. in 1896
brings to the public eye, once more the* grand scheme
which now has its followers throughout all Jewry, and
offers a striking "example of the stupendous obstacles
which' stand in the way of a fulfillment of it. Worthy to
be ranked as one of the phenomena of the history of
the races, yet doomed, it would seem, .to be the last
and greatest tragedy of this 'people of tragic history, is
this remarkable attempt to rehabilitate a state, dead
these 1600 years, with a congeries, of nationalities whose
tongues are babel.
In the very zeal which moved this fanatic to level
his pistolat Nordau -is. to be found one great barrier
to the success" of the movement. Distrust of their lead
ers, suspicion of the motives of "their highest men, jeal
ousy among themselves^these. are the leaden weights
which drag upon the enterprise. In the very nature of
things it cannot be expected of human nature that- a
great brotherhood of religious enthusiasts, gathered from
every, civilized- land and representing a dozen different
nationalities, should possess any great degree of har
mony, lofty and undivided as their purpose may be.
In a recent essay, upon the Zionist movement Nordau
himself has given voice to this very danger. He says:
"Many of them (the opponents of the movement) con
tent themselves with libeling and insulting- leaders of the
Zionist movement. This kind of ; hostility, they who are
vilified can afford tp despise. Men who.fwithout expect
ing the slightest advantage to themselves, out of the
purest, rriost unselfish love for the unhappy ones of their
race, out of reverence for their forefathers, out of a
general spirit of philanthropy, have made. the. greatest'
sacrifices; in money, time, strength aiid health in order
to elevate their people. and to free the millions" of in

saw a pile of glittering coins, bright
as if fresh from the mint. To v flll his

'A Delicacy. *
SOME time ago The Call directed attention to cer
tain statements made by Herr Ballin, director gen
-eral of the Hamburg-American line, in an inter
view., with the New York Herald, in opposition to the
policy of promoting the American merchant marine by
governmental aid. The statements of Mr. Balhn were
reviewed by Senator Frye, one of the strongest advo
cates of the policy which the German ship-owner con
demns. He pointed out that the upbuilding of the Ger
man merchant marine was due to governmental aid, and
that American ships, unassisted by the Government and
compelled to. pay high prices for American labor, both in
constructing the ship and in operating it, could not
compete with the subsidized foreign lines built and run
by cheap foreign labor.
The discussion did not end there. Foreign ship
owners arc so eager to prevent the ', upbuilding â¢ of an
American merchant marine that would deprive them of
the "immense annual tribute they now draw from this
country that they have not been willing to let the issue
pass without attempting at least to refute the arguments
of the Senator. One of the ablest of these efforts to dis
credit the shipping bill appears in the New York Herald
of January 2 in the form of "a long and interesting article
by Emil L. Boas, general manager of the Hamburg-
American line. Mr. Boas strenuously upholds the asser
tions of his director general, and insists that the Ameri
can people would be very foolish should they imitate
the policy of the Germans and promote their merchant
marine by the grant of governmental aid.
In the course of his reply to Herr Ballin Senator
Frye quoted a report on the German ship subsidies- from
United States Consul General Mason at Berlin, and said:
"Our Consul General goes on to show how subsidy and
the accompanying requirements that the subsidized ships
shall be built in German yards so stimulated construc
tion in the empire that both the North German Lloyd
and Hamburg-American companies were enabled to or
der home ships like the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse,
Friedrich der Grosse, Koenigin Luise, Auguste Vic
toria, Fuerst Bismarck, Patricia and Palatia. That they
did all this Consul General Mason declares was mainly
due to the fact that they were forced into it by an
act of legislation."
Mr. Boas, in replying to Senator Frye, undertakes to
break the force of the report of Consul General Mason
by saying that the Hamburg-American line has enjoyed
the benefits of a subsidy for but two steamers out of a
fleet of one hundred and twenty-five, and that so far
from being forced by legislative action to withdraw its
patronage from British contractors, during all the period

The controversy is the more interesting to the Amer
ican people because it shows how eager the foreign
=hip-owners are to defeat any measure before' Congress
designed to promote the American merchant' marine.
It has been estimated that the tribute we pay to foreign
ers for carrying our ocean commerce amounts to as
much as $200,000,000 annually. Perhaps that accounts
for Â£he interest they take in the shipping bill and their
repeated counsel to the American people not to enact

THE two wings of the Democracy seem determined
to feed, either separately or together. The Jack
son banquet in Omaha seems to have enraged the
supporters of Mr. Bryan, who propose to give him a dol
lar dinner, at Lincoln on his return from Europe, in
which he shall be the lone, bright and particular star.
â¢Between these two political dinners one has been eaten
and spoken over in New York, which brought together
Tammany and Hill. Olney and Murphy. Mr. Olney
made a polished speech, but it was an example of innu
endo. It attacked thje administration in negative meta
phor, by laying down what a Democratic administration
would not do. In this way our present foreign policy
was attacked. But Mr. Olney seems to have forgotten
his letter, written when Hawaii and the Philippines
were burning questions, in which he put Washington's
farewell address out of focus as of. any present value.
That address had long been a.guideboard on the na
tional highway, but Mr. Olney chopped it down arid
planted in its place another, inscribed "The. United
States_ assumes its responsibility as a world power."
Conservative Democrats were appalled at his position,
while the more adventurous spirits of the party rejoiced
at his expansive views. Now he appears, eating and
drinking and railing because his counsel has been fol
lowed. What did he mean by .a world power? Are we
to stick our foot out into the world and when it is trod
on are we to whimper, apologize, or kick? The Demo
cratic Monroe doctrine makes us the trustees of the
hemisphere. Are we to let Germany plant naval stations
here, permit the revolutionary bandits of Central Amer
ica prevent our building the canal, let a foreign power
acquire islands that command either of its ends, and be a
world power for bluster and not for business? If so,
Mr. Olney's letter was our commission as the Don
Quixote of the nations, with a barber's basin for the
helmet of Mambrino and a cheese knife for the sword of
the Cid Campeador. He does not seem to appreciate the
difference between a world power and a world laughing
stock. But, after all, his speech had all the frigid dig
nity of New England in it, and when he came to discuss
Presidential candidates he had only one to offer, and
that his old chief, Mr. Cleveland.
As Mr. Cleveland has declined, and is not in the habit
of trifling, this was equivalent to saying that the' party
has no candidate. Then a letter from Mr. Cleveland was
read in which he took occasion to read a needed lecture
to the new Tammany government of New York, exhort
ing it to behave and govern wisely and cleanly. This
was like advising the leopard to change his spots and
the Ethiopian his skin. There is no assurance that what
the seasoned Knickerbocker Van Wyck failed to do will
be done by the raw and sentimental McClellan.
After this Mr. Hill was introduced and justified the
sobriquet of "'Little Dave," given him by his old chief
Tweed. He proceeded to feed his hearers the peanuts of,
politics. He nominated both Murphy and McClellan to
the Presidency, won victories in his mind, and measured
the administration in his half-pint cup. The dinner proba
bly produced no effect except indigestion for thos/2 who
ate it, and the country is sick guessing in the dark about
what the party will do. Nor does the party itself seem
to know any better now than' it did after the defeat of
1900. Its orators speak in more tongues than â¢ have
been heard since the dispersion of man upon the plains
of Shinar. Bryan's dollar dinner will add to the Babel.
We do not pretend that such a condition is best for
the country or for the Republican party. In a free soci
ety intelligent opposition is a necessity. But naturally
the Republican party cannot be responsible for creating
such an opposition to itself. That rests upon the shoul
ders of its friend the enemy, and instead of doing it the
enemy is eating indigestible dinners and talking indiges
tible tommyrot.
"The* greatest freak you ever saw,"
was the answer; "a cat with buttons

"You are a lucky man," said the

For more than an hour he had been
sitting in a dark corner in the waiting
room at the Central Emergency* Hos
pital. Not a word had he uttered dur
ing all that time; neither had he stirred
and the attaches were beginning to
wonder what brought him there. He
did not look to be in need of any treat
ment and as he made no disturbance
no one bothered him. For fully an
other hour he remained there and then
suddenly he got up and tip-toed to an
other corner of the room. A few min
utes later, without uttering a sound or
making a particle of noise, he tip-toed
back again. Then, still on tip-toe, he
began circling around the room. Sud
denly he made a dive under the wall
desk on which is kept the book of rec
ords of the hospital. As he landed on
his hands and knees under the desk
he let out a yell of triumph. "I've got
you, I've got you," he cried, rising to
his feet, and laughing .and capering
about with Joy.
"What have you got?" said the stew
ard, who had rushed Into the room at
the sound of the man's voice.
His Fortune Made.
Even more important than the "bro
ken arpeggrios" are the "running ar
peggios." In these the same notes are
used as in the other arpeggios, but the
runs, once started, are played straight
up the keyboard as far as the will of
the pianist. Instead of continually go
ing back and starting over again, as
in the arpeggios I have already de
scribed. The runs are, In fact, un
broken, and therein lies the difference
between the two.
The fingers used in the running ar
peggios of the right hand are the first,
second and third. The fifth finger
would naturally fall on the upper C
of the octave, but the thumb passes
under the other fingers (exactly as it
does in the scale) and comes out on C,
thus carrying the hand along to the
next octave, and so on, up and down
the keyboard. In descending, the third
finger is the one that crosses over on
its downward courseâ the left hand be
ing just the opposite of the right, both
ascending and descending.
In these arpeggfos, as in the scales
already described, great care must be
taken that the finger that crosses over
or under the others (either ascending
or descending) does not bring into un
due prominence the note on which it
strikes. As a preventive of this it will
be well for the pupil to review the
"preparatory scale exercise" given in
one of the earlier lessons. In. this ex
ercise the passing of the fingers over
and under is dealt with, and it -can
easily be. brought to the assistance of
the pupil who is really trying to make
his runs sound "harplike." It is es
pecially Important that there should be
no hitch in the rhythm of an arpeggio,
as the whole effect is necessarily spoiled
by even one halting or stumbling note.
In order to work ui> these runs to a
rapid tempo they should be treated ex
actly as are the scales. In other words,
they should be practiced with the met
ronome, and counted in "ones," "twos"
and "threes" (as explained in other les
sons), according to the number of oc
taves comprised.
Next the fingers move up to E, that
is, the E just above the C on which
they began the exercise. In this case
the notes to be played in succession
are E. G. C, E. The other of the fin
gers is first the thumb, then second
finger, then fourth (on account of the
long reach between G and C), then
fifth finger, in the right hand. The
order used in the left is first and fifth,
then fourth, then second, then first
finger or thumb. 'At the next . move
the fingers start with thumb and fifth
finger, as usual, but this time on G.
The other notes in the group (C, E, G)
are played by the second, fourth and
fifth fingers in the right hand, and
third, second and first In the left
hand. Xext the first and fifth fingers
take C once more, bringing them just
an octave higher than they were
when the exercise started.
As soon as the student becomes fa
miliar with the style of fingering nec
essary for these arpeggios he must be
gin practicing them systematically,
from one octave to another, up and
down the whole length of the piano.
The descending arpeggios need no
explanation, as the fingering is Just
the same as it was in the ascending
arpeggio except that the right hand
uses in descending the fingering that
the left hand used in ascending, and
the fingers of the left hand are used
exactly as those of the right hand
were in the ascending exercise. This
explanation may sound rather intri
cate to the uninitiated, but it all
works out very simply, indeed, as the
pupil will see when he begins, j
The right hand starts with the
thumb (first finger) on C. and the left
hand with the fifth finger on C an oc
tave below the right Next, the sec
ond finger in the right hand strikes E,
while the left hand at the same time
strikes E with the fourth finger. Then
G is struck with the third finger in
the right hand, and the second finger
in the left. Next the fifth finger of
the right hand strikes C and the left
covers C with the thumb. This is the
first part of the arpegrgio.
A long apprenticeship at the single
scales makes a splendid foundation for
the time when the hands are to prac
tice the scales together, and even after
the student has become most proficient
in rar>ld, difficult scale work with the
hands together he will gain much by
going back occasionally to the single
scale, played with separate hands.
Now we come to the "arpeggios."
Tou w'll remember that I explained
the meaning of the word (harp) in
one of my earlier lessons, and the pu
pil must try to carry out the word
meaning by m&king his runs as harp
like as possible.
We will take first the "broken ar
peggios." with the key of C for a sam
ple key, understanding that the ar
peggios, when once learned, are to be
practiced on all the keys, as are the
other forms of the scale. â¢
AH this is well for the pupil to learn
fairly soon, but I preferred not to bring
It into these lessons earlier, as it is
best to become perfectly familiar with
the simple scale, played with the hands
separate, before attempting to put them
together or trying to go too much into
the Intricacies of the scales that con
tain sharps and flats.
Too much use of the hands together
Is not a good thing in scale practice,
for in that way one hand unconsciously
becomes careless and depends upon the
other hand to do all the steady work.
note, or, In other words, the beginning
of every octave â this, of course, to be
done only in rapid scale practice.
This" should all be worked up with
the aid of the metronome, as explained
in former lessons.

Despite the assaults of' the traducers and notwith
standing the fact that among the Hebrew race itself the
Zionist movement finds its bitterest enemies, the move
ment which was set on foot in 1896 has been making
great headway. Upon no uncertain and evanescent foun
dations have the Zionists built their hopes for the es
tablishment of a new Palestine, but upon the firm rock
of nationality. For the sake of the brave few who have
already gone to the Holy Land and there begun to till
the soil, for the sake of the thousands in Russia who
count the Christmas celebration of the Greek church
only as a signal for murder and rapine, it is to be
hoped that the stupendous dream of the Zionists may
some day Have its full realization.

The stout ship Olivebank from down
Yarmouth way lay becalmed in the fair
bay of San Francisco. The hull shone
with new paint and the rigging was
as taut as an undershirt on a prize
fighter. Everything was rhip-shape,
except that a vandal had stolen her
compasses. All that remained to steer
by was the Northern star and the
Southern cross. A merciful providence
has sequestered these from thieves for
the benefit of mariners. - .
Also there was missing from the ship
a deep-sea mariner by the name of
William Henderson. The bold captain
put the compasses and the missing sai
lor together and complained to the po
lice. When Henderson was caught he
was on the point of departure on an
other deep-sea vessel, bound for the
coral shores of Tahiti. An investiga
tive policeman found that Henderson
had pledged the compasses for a paltry
sum and spent one glad night on the
proceeds. "
Before Judge Conlan yesterady the
captain of the ship was on the bridge
for a few minutes. He told the court
that one of the compasses was worth
"fully 4 pun," and the other cost "15
pun." Jack Rice, ' the clerk, who has
dealt in all kinds of money during a
brief but eventful career, figured out
that both were misdemeanor charges,
and so advised the Judge. Accordingly
Henderson was consigned to the tender
care of the Sheriff for six months on
each charge. It was really necessary
for him to get his bearings without the
aid of the ship's compasses.
"I don't believe I care to look at
sawdust," said the Judge. "For four
teen years I have gazed at it during
campaigns, and, besides, I. don't like
steam beer. You are adjudged guilty
and must pay a fine of $5. Why don't
you hire a scavenger of your own and
let our scavengers alone?"
Ah Wing was a defendant in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday. He has been
in the habit of sweeping the sawdust
out of his fish shop" in Fish alley and
carefully depositing it on a wagon fur
nished by the Board of Public Works.
It is a law enacted by the Supervisors
that all garbage must be carted away
at the expense of its original possessor,
and there be many from Sicily who are
glad to take the job for a small re
muneration.
Ah Wing had a sample of nice, clean
sawdust which he was anxious to make
"Exhibit A" for the'defense. Through
an interpreter he told the Judge that
everything he had loaded on the wag
ons of the Board of Public Works was
as sweet as the cedar grindings he of
fered as evidence.
Ah Lung possessed himself of a new
hose, and the pride of it led him to vio
late the law*. He insisted on wetting
dowji nearly every sidewalk in China
town. So thoroughly was he infatuated
with his new acquisition that he turned
the stream on Policeman George Doug
lass, who was quietly patrolling his
beat. Douglass remembered about an
ordinance prohibiting wetting the side
walks after 8 o'clock in the morning, so
he haled Ah Lung before Judge Mogan
yesterday. The Chinaman was fined $5
for his liberal use of water and told to
never again sprinkle a policeman. \
Chief Wlttman identified specimens
of the defendant's handwriting, which
she had written in his presence after
her arrest, and they were admitted as
evidence. The case will go^ on this
morning:. .
Carl Schmidt, steward at the Ger
man Hospital, testified to Bowers' con
dition when he was taken to the hos
pital, where he died In a few hours, and
Alfred Voligny, a member of the Odd
Fellows' lodge to which Bowers be
longed, gave similar. testimony.
The trial of Mrs. Martha E. Bowers,
charged with the murder of her hus
band, Martin L. Bowers, by adminis
tering arsenic to*. him, -was resumed be
fore a jury in Judge Cook's court yes
terday. Several witnesses were exam
ined, but their evidence was the same
as given at the preliminary examina
tion. They were all sharply cross-ex
amined by Attorney Erank G. Drury.
Dr. John F. Dillon testified to having
attended Bowers in July last and hav
ing\diagnosed the case as one of gas
tritis. Dr. John Lagan, who had also
been called in, testified he had treated
Bowers for a weak heart, fever and
paralysis. Dr. Frank T. Green, the city
chemist, testified to having found ar
senic in the deceased's stomach.
Dr. Alfred McLaughlin, who attended
Bowers up to the day before his death,'
testified as to his condition during that
time. When Bowers was removed to
the Waldeck Sanatorium he improved,
and at the request of the defendant he
was taken home again, when the bad
symptoms again prevailed. The wit
ness denied having signed the prescrip
tion of "McLaughlin, M. D." for ar
senic, which was filled at a drug store
at Fifth and Folsom streets.
J. C. Peterson, the drug clerk who
filled the prescription referred to, testi
fied that to the best of his knowledge
and belief Mrs. Zylphla Sutton, the de
fendant's sister, was the woman who
brought it to the store and got the ar
senic. She assured him that it was for
Dr. McLaughlin. There was no quan
tity mentioned in the prescription. It
was filled a few days before Bowers'
death.
In view of the proposed investigation
>y the Board of Supervisors mto the
illeged violation of civil service by the
health Board it is not likely that any
>f the civil service appointees will be
Listurbed by the Board of Public Works
it itp"rneetlnK to-day. A number of
;he 140 non-civil service or so-called
emporary employes will lose their
>laces. among them boing eighteen jan
tors. tn be replaced by one man from
?ach Assembly district who took an
ictive part in Mayor Schmitz's cam
)aign. In fact, it is stated on good
iiithority that the fiat has gone forth
hat men who worked for the Mayor
vill be retained or appointed to places.
The Board of Health will meet to
morrow morning at 11 o'clock and prob
ably take some action looking to a
ccrmpliance with the civil service rule
providing- that when civil service eligi
bles are laid off it shall be in the in
verse order of their standing on the
eligible list
It appears that through Inadvertence
some of the food and market inspectors
were retained to the exclusion of others
removed who stand higher on the eligi
ble list The attention of the Civil Ser
vice Commission was called to the vio
lation of the rule and a conference was
mmediately held with Dr. James "Ward,
president of the Health Board, who
assured the commission that the error
would be rectified at once, as the
Health Board did not desire to violate
any of the rules adopted by the Civil
Service Commission. In that event
some of the appointments made will be
revoked.
Regarding the contention of certain
:ivil service appointees who were re
moved that the Health Board has no
'.egal right to abolish positions, the
CTivll Service Commission holds to the
opinion that the Health Board has the
power to determine the necessity of
positions under its control and may
abolish them if It so desires. City At
tnj-ney Lane rendered an opinion some
:ime ago on this point when the Board
3f Public Works desired to appoint a
Tiale stenographer to serve under John
3arnett, the then building inspector.
Lane held that the Civil Service Com
mission had no power to question the
appointment of employes in the various
Tiunicipal departments other than to
lee that the civil service provisions of
.he charter were complied with in mak-
Tig the appointments. The contention
3f the Board of Works was upheld and
Thomas Powers was appointed sten
sgrapher. though the Civil Service
Commission did not think that Barnett
seeded one.
Regarding the abolition of the sec
retaryship of the Board of Health, it
i= the latter's opinion that as the char
:er does not provide for the appoint
nent of a secretary it has the right to
tbolish the place.
WTiite makes a general denial of the
charges of Attorney Philbrook and the
WaCleighs. Attorney Stevens for the
society says that nothing further will
be done to keep the children from their
parents. The Wadleighs have a home
in Seattle.
The girl subsequently corroborated
these statements and made further al
legations against her temporary guard
ians.
When the decision of the court was
announced by Chief Justice Beatty yes
terday the children Joyfully ran to their
mother, showing unmistakably how
they felt about the matter. Attorney
Horace Philbrook represented the Wad
leighs. White acted on the strength
of an order by Judge Coffey. The court
declared that this proceeding was whol
ly void.
Sarah Wadleigh has been living at
White's home since she was taken from
her mother. She states that she was
compelled to renounce her own name
and to call herself "Florence White."
She also, it is alleged, was instructed
to call White and his wife "papa" and
"mamma." respectively.
Philbrook stated to the court yester
day that the Whites took from the child
yesterday morning everything that
they had given her since she went to
their house. He also asserted that Mrs.
White gave the girl 5 cents and in
structed her to run away from her
mother if the court should decide
against White's claim.
The Supreme Court declared yesterday
that M. J. White, secretary of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren had no right to the
custody of May and Sarah "Wadleigh.
whom he separated from their parents
and each other nearly a' year ago. The'
little girls were told to go with their
mother. The two boys, John and Solo
mon, who were taken away by White
in much the same manner as the girls,
are in the custody of the Boys* and
Girls' Aid Society, and an attempt will
be made to have them returned to their
parents through a writ of habeas cor
pus.
Wade Cabenhover told a story to
Judge Fritz yesterday on how it feels
to be a human fish. He parted with
$1500 to a trio of bunko men, who prom
ised to secure for him nearly all the
southern part of the State of Califor
nia, with theaters and such * things
dropped in. Cabenhover was the only
witness yesterday, and Prosecutor Ike
Harris took him over the many hurdles
he crossed while in the possession of
his pseudo friends.
The accused men are Ben Michaels
and William Harvey, but according to
the testimony of the complaining wit
ness neither of them received any
money. There is a man named William
Stanton, who so far has outreached the
long arm of justice. He actually re
ceived the criSD roll of greenbacks from
Cabenhover, and until he is found the
prosecution of the case seems hopeless.

The further hearing of the case was
continued until to-morrow, when the
defendant will take the sta din her
own behalf.
He managed to find certain delin
quencies in connecting the letters of
the signature and also thought that. the
uplines were heavier than was usual
in Laymance's signature. The defend
ant's counsel accepted him as a hand
writing expert and succeeded in mak
ing him uncomfortable. Then he was
shown other checks signed by Lay
mance and found the same differences
that he complained of in the disputed
cvheck. Then he told the court that he
was decidedly uncertain about the gen
uineness of the contested signature.
Laymance was called to the stand
and strenuously denied ever * signing
the demand for $100 which Mrs. Law
rence had presented, to the bank and
on which she had secured the money.
His testimony occupied the better part
of the afternoon and his relations with
the woman were fully developed. It
was not a pleasant story to listen to
and it showed Laymance up in rather a
bad light, albeit that h ; has a bank ac
count.
Mrs. Maude Lawrence, becomingly
gowned in gray and looking five years
younger than the 31 years she claims,
was in Judge Cabaniss' court yesterday
to answer to the charge of forgery- She
is accused of writing checks on the Co
lumbian Banking Company and sign
ing the name of J. W. Laymance, a
prominent real estate dealer of Oak
land, to the instruments.
Specifically she is accused of the for
gery of a $100 check, although there
are several other pieces of white paper
which Laymance claims he did not
sign on which she obtained good, hard
money of the United States from Paul
Mertz, who alternates with the paying
teller of the banking institution during
lunch hours. '
The check on which the charge of
forgery was based was largely in evi
dence and a big bale of other checks,
admittedly genuine, were also pro
duced. Mertz posed as a handwriting
expert and pronounced the disputed
check spurious. At the same time he
admitted that on its presentation he
had passed the signature as ' that Of
Laymance. He told Judge CabJuiiss
that the president, the cashier and^ the
paying teller of the bank believed the
signature to be genuine, but .he alone
stood out for the forgery charge. ,
in the County Jail. The original charge
was burglary, but the Judge thought
the temptation to own such raiment
was sufficient justification to reduce the
charge to a misdemeanor.

Dandruff Is Caused by a Germ That Saps
tbe Hair's Vitality.
It is now a settled fact that dandruff
Is caused by a germ. Falling hair and
baldness are the result of dandruff. Dr.
E. J. Beardsley, of Champaign. 111., got
hold of the new hair preparation, New-
bro's Herpicideâ the only one that kills
the dandruff germ. He says: "I used
Herpicldo for my dandruff and falling
hair and I am well satisfied with the
result." Dr. J. T. Fugate, of Urbana. 111.,
says: "I have used Herpicide for dan-
druff with excellent results. I shall pre-
scribe it in my practice." Herpicide kills
the dandruff germ. Physicians as Well as
the general public say so. Sold by lead-
ing druggists. , Send 10c in stamps for

Brings His Invalid Son to This City
From Portland on Advice of
Physicians.
A special train bearing: Commodore
Elbridge . T. Gerry of New York and
his invalid son, who was taken sick
on his way north recently with Presi
dent E. H. Harriman of the Southern
Pacific Company, arrived in this city
from Portland at an early hour this
morning. The special came south yes
terday afternoon, but fearing the ex
posure of a trip to this city across the
bay might be injurious to his son.
Commodore Gerry arranged to have
his train taken around by way of San
Jose. \
An engine and train crew left here
last evening to bring the special up
from San Jose.
Young Gerry came to the coast with
President Harriman and was taken
sick with typhoid fever while the rail
road magnate's train was on its way
to Portland. As the young man's con
dition was apparently critical, his
brother and. father were advised by
wire and the brother immediately
started for the West, Harriman ar
ranging to have the tracks pleared for
the special, which made record time
to Portland. By the time it reached
there the sick man was out of danger.
Commodore Gerry came West later to
take his son home and was advised to
make the journey by way o'f this city.

Six doss were taken Into the second

off at 3:08 and worked along a slough
bed. After quite a long . run, : during
which both dogs showed to good ad
vantage in speed and range as well
as In the exhibition of bird sense in
hunting out likely ground. Spectators
flushed a bevy and the birds scattering
out Glenwood made two nice points
along the slough bank, being perfectly
stanch in "all his work. Later Sombra
made two good, points in the corn field,
followed by a stylish point by Glen.
Sombra. inished the work with a point
in a clump of brush, froo .-hlch a bird
flushed a few moments later. This fin
ished the bird work of the trace, both
having run in fine form throughout.
The second brace "of this series .con
sisted of Hicks' \ Bab ?Â¦ and Glenrose,
which wej^e cast off on birds scattered
In a corn field. Bab did \ not show the
speed and dash of the previous day
and' hunted with rather a low head,

capturing the long-ear. Both dogs then
engaged In several more chases, which
taxed their strength and handicapped
them in their further work. In ranging
through a dry slough bed Klamath
drew to a flush on a large bevy which
scattered in different directions, j No
points were establlshel on them, how
ever, and after a run of about forty
five minutes the dogs were ordered up
and a short drive was made to Gos
ford's, where lunch was eaten.
Klamath, aside from his wildness, is a
high-class young dog and may be heard
from later on.
Dr. Leonard's pointer dog Wallace
Bruce, handled by Lucas, arid Alex
Hamilton's setter dog Lady's Lad, han
dled by Coutts, were cast off after
lunch and ran forty minutes without
any decided work on game.
Lad showed fine style and good speed,
coupled with fair range, and Wallace
Bruce was not altogether lacking in
those qualities either. After a short
run along an old slough bed a bevy was
flushed by the spectators, part of it
taking to cover along a ditch. Neither
dog was able to locate, probably owing
to the beat. Lad made an undecided
stand on three birds which flushed as
he stopped, and later made several
stylish points, but unluckily no birds
could be flushed to them. Wallace
Bruce made a Ions cast to a corn field
near the end of his beat, but like his
brace mate failed to locate birds.

The fifteenth was a desperate round.

In the clinches. The crowd was jeering

stronger, but Scanlan held on tenacious
ly and punished his opponent about the
body. Millet worked his "shift" success
fully and sent a resounding left to the
body.
The twentieth round was give and
take, each man trying for a knockout.
When the gong sounded Referee Neil
threw both arms in the air, signaling a
draw. Millet and his friends seemed
fairly well satisfied with the decision,
but Scanlan and his backers thought he
should have had the fight on points and
were not slow in telling the referee how
they felt.
Millet was seconded by Alex Greg

JOE GAXS *AGAIX VICTOR.
Colored Champion Wins Fair Decision
Over Willie Fitzgerald.
DETROIT, Jan. 12. â Joe Gans, the
lightweight champion, obtained a well
merited decision over Willie Fitzgerald
of Brooklyn at the end of their ten
round bout before the Metropolitan
Athletic Club to-night. He knocked
Fitzgerald down four times, forced the
fighting most of the time and landed
more effective and more powerful
blows. Fitzgerald had the better, of
only two rounds, the" fifth and ninth.
The rest of the time Gans showed a
most decided superiority. He knocked
Fitzgerald down in the first, fourth,
sixth and eighth rounds. He kept up
a constant hammering of the Brooklyn
boy's ribs.
After twenty rounds ot rough and
tumble fighting in the ring of the Col
ma Athletfg Club last night Referee
Jim Neil called the bout between Jim
Scanlan and Joe Millet a draw. To have
decided In favor' of either of the men
would have been unjust, as neither had
so decisive a lead as to warrant such
an award.
While both men were supposed to be
fire-eaters in the ring, and while they
fought viciously: throughout, neither
could land a knockout i uhch. First
one had a slight lead and then the other
had the advantage. In the first round
Millet raised a lump over Scanlan's left
eye. Later in the fight he cut it, but
the injury did not handicap him.
In the ninth round Scanlan closed
Millet's left eye completely and thus
took all the accuracy out of his blows.
In the eighteenth round Millet was
butted and the left eye puffed out until
it assumed uncanny proportions. Mil
let does not take kindly to training and
he is said to have shirked his work
while preparing for this engagement.
The attendance was small, but the
spectators made up in energy what
they lacked in numbers. From first to
last the partisans of each man kept up
a continual running fire of coaching in
formation. The gallery was for Millet,
but the spectators downstairs seemed
Scanlan adherents. The first round was
devoted almost entirely to feinting,
hardly a blow being struck until near
the end of the round. The spectators
thought they would see no fight, and
urged Uie. men to get in and do some
thing. Millet played for the body just
before the gong sounded and also cut
Scanlan's left eye with a Jolty right.
MILLETS PECULIAR POSE.
Millet did most of the work in the
second round, but no serious damage
resulted. He assumed an unusual box
ing position, with his right foot for
ward, which puzzled Scanlan, who did
not seem to know what to do. The third
round was full of hard fighting, with
Millet doing the cleanest hitting. He
sent a left and right to the head re
peat edly. Scanlan's best blow in this
round was a left to the head. The
spectators were surprised that* there
was sÂ» little force behind the blows of
both men, as shown by the results
when they landed.
The fourth round was all In Millet's
favor, Scanlan clinching repeatedly to
avoid punishment. Millet opened the
fifth round with a left to the head, and
they exchanged rights to the head.
Both missed vicious swings, and then
Scanlan walked into a right uppercut.
Both seemed tired in the sixth round,
but they kept trying all the time. The
seventh was In Millet's favor, Scanlan
hanging on repeatedly to avoid punish
ment. Â¦ â -
The eighth was a wild round. Millet
sent a right to the jaw, which stag
gered Scanlan. The latter hung on and
then suddenly came back, fighting des
perately. The referee had a difficult
time in breaking the men, who wrestled
him all over the ring. When Millet
came up for the ninth round his. left
eye was closed, and it put him at' quite
a disadvantage. Scanlan was improv
ing and seemed more eager to mix mat
ters. Scanlan cut Millet ,badly about
the nose and mouth in the tenth round.
Scanlan opened proceedings in the elev
enth with a straight left to the nose.
MiNet came- back with a left to the
head, and they both swung lefts for the
head. Millet getting there first. Scan

Despite the fog which hung over Ba

started fast and ranged out well, al
though Sandiewood was inclined to
trail his brace-mate at times. After a
brief run both dog> commenced to
make time along a slough bed and.
Sandlcwood taking the lead, went
through a bevy and the birds flushed in
all directions. Neither dog established
Â¦a p^int. although the setter searched
diligently.
Sandlewood was overcautious work

vantage when working among birds.
He pointed once, but it proved false.
Stars Rod showed himself a stylish,
independent ranger and kept at his
work until ordered up. The brace -was

The second brace, consisting of J.

by Dodge, were the next brace down
and were cast off in open country con
taining sparse cover. Both started at
fair speed, but Pearl did not range
very wide and ran in circles. Soon after
starting the setter let out a peg and
made a series of wide casts, which end
rd in a long one to cover along a slough
bed one-third* of a mile distant, which
was the last seen of him for the day.
Pearl continued to work industriously,
and casting into the timber a bevy of
quai! was seen to rise, the birds scat
tering out in the timber along the
slough bed.
No work on the birds materialized,
and Pearl, which had been running

ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
It was reported that Katie Walcott
was "liked" in - the first yesterday.
Then if that is the mare's race she
w'll scarcely do.
Miss Betty ran better for Haack
than she did for Bell.
After Somenos registered, both Sid
ney Bender and his partner, C. Paders,
indulged in some elevating. Paders
boosted the horse to $1200 and Ben
der raised another $100. : Trainer
Murry bid the customary $5 and there
was nothing doing.
The $1000 handicap at one and an
eighth miles is the feature event of
the card to-day. The New York
horse, Oarsman, has top weight, 118
pounds, and as Proper and Fossil are
absentees, it looks as if he might de
liver the merchandise.
When .Tommy Burns began opera
tions on Lacy Crawford, the gelding
must have thought he was" in a Chi
nese josshouse with a bundle of fire
crackers tied to his tail. He showed
speed that was entirely unlooked for.
o At the annual meeting of the stock
holders of the New California Jockey
Club held yesterday the same officers
and directors .-were re-elected. They
are: President, Thomas H. Williams;
vice president and treasurer, Adam
Andrew; secretary, .Percy^'W. Treat;
board of directors, Thomas H. Wil
liams.) Adam -Andrew, Colonel D. M.
Burns, = D. T. Murphy and' Alexander
Hamilton. '
Donovan, who rode First Chip
when that horse was left at the post,
is reported to have sailed for Los An
geles. Too bad they don't race in
Mexico; that country is only a trifle
longer jump.
Hildebrand rode two winners.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
If Motorist Barney Oldfleld and his
Bullet No. 2 could have steamed around
the/ course at Oakland yesterday it
would be foolish to guess what sort
of curious records would have been
made. The track looked as smooth and
well groomed as a Folsom convict's
cranium after a visit of the double
naught clippers and any sort of a sell
ing: plater could step a mile in 1:41 over
it. In the six and a h,alf furlong handi
cap Charley Henshall's Martinmas, rid
den by Bullman and a 2 to 1 favorite
in the ring, reduced the California rec
ord from 1:19Â»Â£ to' 1:18%. - Martinmas
carried 108 pounds, and catching the
pacemaker, Hagerdon, in the stretch
won by a length. The world's record
for the distance of 1:18 3-5 is held by
Joe Yeager's mare Jane Holly, made
at, Washington Park July 3, 1903. with
99 pounds in the saddle." San Nicholas,
shouldering 120 pounds and poorly rid
den by Bell, finished a close third j In
the race. Kenilworth never looked
dangerous, Tommy Burns having a fine
view of the race from the caboose.
Three favorites only were successful,
but most of the bookies complained of
having a losing day. First Chip, Ga
waine and Lacy Crawford were all
fairly well backed/being a long way
from "eagle-birds."
Some days ago, in a cheap Futurity
course rprint won by Ulctma, Donovan
managed to get left at' the rost on
First Chip'. Yesterday the chestnut
horse was one of eleven starters in thÂ«
opening mile selling number, with Wil
lie Haack in the saddle. The books laid
5 to 1 about thejCrandall entry and he
went out and won In an ordinary gal
lop in 1:40%. Isabellita, ruling equal
favorite with Hungarian, beat the lat
ter four lengths for the place.
.W. B. Jennings' filly Letola was held
at a very short price to win the six
furlong sprint following and just did
make good and that was all. Kunz rode
the short-priced one and early found
difficulty in heading Ananias, the
Schorr, colt. Through the stretch Hil
derbrand almost outflnished Kunz, for
Letola was only' a head to the good
passing the judges. Telephone received
a hustling ride in order to take third
place from Miss Betty.
The rallblrd contingent all had So
menos up their sleeve, but it ap
peared to be an open secret, for the
ring opened up the 4-year-old at 7 to
10. At this short price he was heavily
supported, and though well handled by
Hllderbrand was nearly straight at the
end to down Tom Slavin a head. The
latter horse was quoted at 13 to 1, and
J. Daly gave him an excellent ride.
Velma Clark, poorly ridden by Larsen,
ran into the show.
Seme of the horses under Hildebrand
seem to run for the Yeager $5000 beauty
as they did for Chevalier when he was
the "medicine man" in the old Bay Dis
trict days. Hildebrand had the leg up
on Gawaine, the second choice in the
mile selling affair, fifth on the card,
and had speed enough to burn a wet
dog. Leading from the start the geld
ing won going away at the close, with
Mllas a fair second. Virgie d'Or, the
favorite, had worked. weH, warmed up
as if she liked the climate, but ran so
slow in the race it is suspected some
thing must have happened to her.
Byronerdale was third at 30 to 1.
Tommy Burns finally was given the
leg on a horse in trie final mile and a
sixteenth event that had a chance. He
rode Lacy Crawford, against which tÂ»
to 1 could be had, and overhauling the
pacemaker, Ulilouon, in the stretch out
flnished Hildebrand, getting a neck de
cision. Show honors fell to Frank
Woods. Marlin, the favorite, was out
footed from the start.

For California for January, a month
ly publication issued by the California
Promotion Committee, begins a serial
story, entitled "The Brown Family in
California," telling how a New Eng
land farmer leaves the East and be
comes established in this State. Among
other articles are: A What California
Has Done for Civilization," by Presi
dent David Starr v Jordan of Leland
Stanford Jr. University; "The Most De
sirable City in Which to Live," by
James D. Phelan, former Mayor of San
Francisco, and "California Deciduous
Fruit Shipping," by Alden Anderson,
Lieutenant Gouernor of California.
Tells About California.
The California Promotion Commit
tee has addressed a communication to
the business men of San Francisco
suggesting that in all their correspond
ence to the East, beneath the date line
on their letters they place the maxi
mum temperature of San Francisco of
that day. Thus a letter to the East
would have read yesterday: "San
Francisco, January 12; maximum tem
perature 54 degrees." This will'entail
but little work and if all the business
houses will keep the matter up during
the winter, especially now that the
weather is exceptionally fine, ' San
Francisco will get a good deal of the
right kind of advertising.

As truly as Jesus died for the world because
he eo Joved it, so Dr.. Beard died for the church
because he so -loved it. His sermons were
messages frcm God to -man for the uplifting of
the character of. man in the likeness of . his
Lord and Master.
Dr. E. R. .Willis also paid a beautiful
tribute to the memory of Dr. Eeard..
After the services in the church the
great mass of mournefs filed past the
casket and then the remains were es
corted to. Cypress Lawn Cemetery,
where the interment took place. The
pallbearers were:
I can hardly trust myself to speak. I am
moro fitted to sit with the mourners," so great
was my admiration and my love for this dear
and good man. Â¦ The sorrow that came to you
by telegram first broke on my' heart alone â a
stranger In a strange land. I am here to say
that Dr. Beard died at his post and was faith
ful unto death. It fell to me 'to be the last to
look iron his face in life and the first in
death.
The Rev. A. C. Bane in paying tribute
to his late colleague and friend said:
He was a loving husband; it was the aweet
heart-wlfe with him. And now I congratulate
the fair girls that -their father lived to place
his manhood upon their lives; I congratulate
them that they cherish a blessed hope to-day.
A BEAUTIFUL. TRIBUTE.
Dr. Beard was a sterling character. The
path trodden by . this good man and the wtee
head, the whole soul and the heart of gold re
main as examples. He wa9 untouched by sins
and no scandal ever dimmed his stainless
name. God has transplanted this tree of His
own planting -to a brighter clime.
He had marvelous balance, both morally and
mentally; a clear and Intellectual vision and
withal was wondrously sympathetic. HÂ« was
not a creature of Impulse, "and no matter what
the responsibility we knew we had a m'ijn on
the quarterdeck of those responsibilities who
would wisely guide them.
As a preacher he had a passion for holiness
which alone fits a minister of JeÂ»us Christ.
He was a man of indomitable courage, a knlghl
as gallant as . "when knighthood was in
flower," and his Ehield Is without a stain up
on if. Â¦ "-'
I point to the, yoHDgim^o sand .whoRB
faith has been kindled from hip faith, . and for
any other monument to his memory we may
look to the National Training School, to which
he gave the best of his lifo and which, shall be
a royal diadem In the hand of his God. His
home of all homes I' have ever known was one
of the most ! perfect and cloudless.
It was estimated that quite 3000 per
sons came to the church to pay their
last respects to the lamented pastor,
many of those present coming 'from
other States. Not only. was the church
crowded on the floor and in the gallery,

Within the chancel rails were banked
most beautiful floral pieces sent by nu
merous evangelical churches, and
in the vast assemblage were men of all
walks of life.' Some came a distance to
attend the obsequies, and all testified
by their presence to the high esteem in
which the late Dr. Beard was held In
the community^'
The religious exercises which pre
ceded the eulogies were conducted 'by
the Rev. F. M. Larkln. Ph. D.; Dr. W.

tender resolution of sympathy which
the Methodist ministers adopted as an
expression of sympathy to the bereaved
family and which appeared fully in The
Call yesterday.
Dr. E. R. Dille, who was deeply
moved, expressed his sentiments of ad
miration for the departed In the follow
ing words:
I am a sincere mourner. There is no word
adequate to voice my feelings. For thtrty-flve
years we were close friend* and to know sucht
a man was to *atn a better opinion of tho
world, and nine* he has gone to heaven wa

San Francisco having become a city
of conventions and conferences of vast
national and denomination;- ". import
ance it has occurred to the committee
that an auditorium* constructed, on the
modern plan would be a further induce
ment to organizations to deliberate in
the metropolis of the Pacific Coast.
â¢ Already several gentlemen have
promised to give the movement the
most liberal support and to that end
have offered the committee handsome
pecuniary support toward effecting the
object in view.
One of the first aims of the organiza
tion, should It be- formed, is to build an
auditorium with a capacity which will
allow the holding of conventions on the
largest SÂ£ale. ' â¢ ,
"The plan contemplates making San
Francisco a more desirable city in
which to live.

your acceptance and attendance, we

Mrs. Hueter and the Misses Hueter
entertained a large number of friends
Monday, when they gave a "Spanish
evening" in song and legend. The mu
sic, decorations and costumes were of
the land of the Don, and it proved to be
a charming affair, carrying with it the
real Joy of "being different."
What a social hive the St. Dunstan
has b:come! And what a joy to call
ers, who can cancel ten calls with one
cab! On Monday the 1 following ladles
received thers: Mrs. Gerret Lansing,
Mrs. Augustus Costigan and Mrs.
Mrs. A. B. C. Dohrmann has sent out
cards for a tea to be given at her resi
dence, 1480 Page street, on Saturday,
the 16th, from 3 until 6 o'clock.
The Fortnightlies will, dance at the
Palace on the 22d. A merry dance? The
outlook is good, but it is feared that
Mrs. Salisbury will not be strong
enough to attend the affair.
This is a union that Is in close touch
with all the traditions of old, as well as
the vital spark of the new.

There have been few girls more
felicitated upon their engagements
than was Miss Callaghan, whose be
trothal to Vincent de Laveaga was
whispered abroad at Miss Hogg's tea.
All hail the Mardi Gras! It looked
dubious for a time whether it would
materialize, but its coming is now as
sured. " -
What a round of entertainments, is
being given in honor of the handsome
Mrs. J. Malcolm Henry. Monday night

tante affair, with a sprinkling of last
year's buds. . t
Mrs. Thomas Morffew will hold an in
formal "at home" on next Fridayâ not
to-day, 'as stated. That Mrs. Morf
few will entertain a small host on Fri

As a host at a 1 ball, George Whittell
has quite won the laurels that long
have lain on the brow of Ned Green
way.
The. ball given at the Whittell resi
dence last night in honor of Miss Flor

tinctly a brilliant affair. A veritable
garden of blossoms was gathered in
every room â American Beauties, bride
roses, carnations and flaming poinset
tias. And what a garden of beautiful
girls wound their way through the
dance. And such fetching frocks! The
ball was in truth an outpouring of the
smartest of the young smart set. Â¦

Found Gnilty of Negligence and Un
skillfulness in Navigating the
Coasting Steamer Del Nortc.
Negligence and unskillfulness are
the charges on which Mate F. N. G.
Xordberg: was found gruilty yesterday
by Captains O. FV Holies and J. K.
Bulger, United States local inspectors,
in the matter of the sinking of the
schooner Man' Buhne, C. Green, mas
ter, by the steamer Del Norte off
Kumboldt Bar on December 18 in a
collision.
i In rendering: their decision the in
spectors say: | *
"After a careful consideration of
the evidence in this case, we are of the
opinion that F- N. G. Xordberg was
negligent and unskillful in navigating
the steamer Del Xorte on December
18. 1903, in not keeping a proper
lookout. Had he done so he would
have seen the Mary Buhne in time to
have avo'ded the collision, as it is in
evidence that the Bide lights of the
schooner were burning.
"For reason of such negligence and
unskillfulness, under authority of
power conferred on us under section
445 of the United States Revised Stat
utes, we hereby suspend the license of
F. X. G. Nordberg as mate for the
period of one. year from date. We do
not blame C. Green in this matter.

SUPER VISING INSPECTOR
ADVISES MORE CAUTIONS'
Warns United States Local Inspectors
to Prevent Such Disasters as That
of the Clallam Wreck.
Captain John Bermingham, Unit
ed States supervising inspector of
steam vessels for the Pacific Coast,
has addressed the following letter to
the local inspectors at Seattle with
reference to the wreck of the steamer
Clallam:
"Messrs. Whitney and Turner, Unit
ed States local inspectors of. steam
vessels. Seattle. Wash. â Sirs: In view
of the recent shocking: disaster, which
carried to the bottom the steamer
Clallam and drowned, as reported,
fifty-four of her passengers, it be
hooves you to examine very closely
the condition of all steam vessels ply
ing in the straits Â«f San Juan de Fuca.
â¢â¢From the news we get here it ap
pears that the CMallam disaster was
brought about by the giving way of a
deadlight, possibly a shutter having
a deadlight in it. in her side above her
main deck. Be that as it may, her
loss indicates * that none but the
Etanchest steam vessels should be
employed in those waters. The pub
lic, as well as the Government, nat
urally look to you for a searching in
vestigation in the case, of the Clal
lam, which, it appears, was only six
months old. Respectfully,
"JOHN BERMIXGHAM,
"Supervising Inspector, First Dis
trict."

SHIP CO.'S TRAINING SHIP.
To Avoid Duty on Coal.
The steam collier Hero arrived yesterday
from Comox with b^ZTt tens of coal. She was
unable to get a berth here and proceeded to
Port Lob Angeles. The duty on foreign coal
will t>e exacted again on and after January 15
and the Hero will proceed to the southern port
at full ppeed, any delay which would keep
her at sea after midnight of January U would
prevent the Tree admission of her big cargo.
The steamer Wellington of the Dunsmuir fleet
is under orders to make all haste to this port
for a similar reason.
Catches Chinese Sneak Thief.
Quong Chee, a Chinese, yesterday picked op
and walked away with two telesccpe baskets
belonging to a woman who was buying a ticket
at the ferry depot. Policeman O'Callaghan wit
nessed the transaction and Quoncs walk with
the baskets was hut a brief perambulation.
After a. chort interview, in which the Celestial
failed to convince the patrolman that what
teemed petty larceny was really absent mind
ednÂ»sÂ«, Quong Chee accompanied O'Callaghan
to the Harbor Police Station, where the Chi
nese was locked up.

The bark Santiago, which arrived
yesterday, twenty days from Hilq, was
run into a few hours after anchoring
off Meiggs wharf by the steamer Rain
ier. The Rainier, just in from Seattle,
was steaming, uo the bay and steering
a course which carried her close to the
Santiago's anchorage. As the steamer
approached the tide swung the bark
across her path and the Rainier's
helmsman was unable to clear the sail
ins: vessel.
The Santiago was struck on the port
quarter. One frame and five of her
plates were bent and the woodwork of
one of the cabins was stove in. The
Rainier's stem was badly smashed and
although nobody sustained any injury
the bill for repairs will be expensive.

VICTORIA, B. C; Jan. 12.â Two tugs
with their flags at half-mast arrived
this morning from ; a cruise in the
straits with five more bodies of wreck
victims.
The steamer Princess Beatrice while
on her way to New Westminster this
morning found the body of Peter La
plante of Friday Harbor, which was
turned over to the Trader and brought
to port. Four other bodies were recov
ered floating in a tide rip between Race
Rocks and Brotchie Ledge by the tug
Edna Grace. These have been identi
fied as N. P. Shaw of Victoria, a prom
inent local business man, mine and ship
owner; Miss Gill, who came from San
Francisco to testify at the Hopper-
Dunsmuir will case, . now proceeding
here; Harvey Sears, stevedore of the
Clallam, â¢ a brother of Captain Sears,
owner and master of the Â¦: Iroquois,
which made an ineffectual search for
the sinking vessel on the night she
foundered, and Miss Minnie Murdoch of
Seattle. . /
Application has been made to the Ot
tawa Government for a commission of
inquiry. The Board of Trade has re
quested the Minister of Marine to es
tablish a life-saving station at Victoria.
The California State Btrard of Trade
desires to have *a booth at St. Louis
from which literature regarding Cali
fornia may be distributed. This was
discussed at a meeting of the board
that took, place yesterday. Manager
Arthur R. Briffgs reported that the
California commissioners to St. Louis
had denied an application for space fur
such a booth, on the ground that other
organizations also are seeking space,
and it would be impossible to grant the
demands of all because there was not
sufficient space to go around. Man
ager Briggs also reported that he had
received a letter frorq Governor Par
dee, which was read. In this Governor
Pardee had written that he fully ap
preciated the cood work of the State
Board of Trade and saw the necessity
for having California well advertised
at St. Louis.
Manager Briggs advised that the
board continue to urge upon the St.
Louis commission the need of having
literature distributed by the State
Board of Trade. He was instructed to
ascertain what could be dÂ«ne. During
the discussion it was stated that*space
has been granted in the California
building for booths for both the Santa
Fe and Southern Pacific companies and
that the transportation people havÂ« lit
erature relative to California at the
exposition.
A comjnunication from Secretary
Cortelyou, chief of the new Depart
ment of Commerce of the National
Government, was also read. He thank
ed the -State Board of Trade for its
offer of co-operation in the matter of
having a representative display of Cali
fornia products placed in the building
of the department. Secretary Cortel
>oU wrote that the offer of co-operation
was highly appreciate3. ,
Managec Briggs reported that the
commercial organizations of San Fran
cisco, which have been considering the
entertainment of a body of forty rep
resentative men from the Philippine
Islands, have decided to show the men
from the Philippines around the city
and the tay. From San Francisco the
Filipinos will go to St. Louis. They
are representative of every principal
industry in the Philippines. The date
for their arrival in this city has not
been announced. Their stay here will
probably last two days.
The work of the State Board of Trade
is evidently appreciated in the interior
of the State- letters of commendation
â¢were received from San Jose, from the
SaÂ» Benito County Improvement Asso
ciationPfrem the Stockton Chamber of
Commerce, from the San Luis Obippo
Couijty Board of Trade and from the
Board of Trade of Modesto. In some
of the letters were Btrongrly worded
resotutiors indorsing the course of the
State Board of Trade.
Thanks were voted to President Chip
man for his action at the recent con
vention at Fresno of the fruit growers
of California. A report to be pub
lished^ illustrative of the mining indus
try of the State, was received from
State Mineralogist Aubury.

Provisions.
Local packers are quoting Hams Vtc lower

Pork 4s also lower. The market Is well sup
plied and quiÂ«t. Lard is unchanged.
The Chicago wires of Bolton. De Ruyter &
Co. say: "Market higher. Hog receipts again
large and prices at the yards were without ma
terial change. The country speculators are,
however, bullish on Provisions, because they
are relatively lower than last year and because
they probably hope for some help from the war
1 news. Receipts of hogs are large and we think
will continue so. While there is a fairly good
â¢ diptributlve demand, yet stocks must be, ac
.cumulating rapidly and the packers are letting
the outside speculators have the product. AVe
are inclined to the view that on these condi

The weather situation is getting grave. The
Weather Bureau report, which Appears in the
; first column, says that pasturage is drying up
, in the southern counties and that the cattle and Â¦
sheep there are dying for want of feed. Local j
butchers report that no lambs of any conse- .
quence have been received inls â¢ year and that I
there will be none if the drought: continues, as ;
the lambs will have to be killed to save the ;
I ewes, as wan done in 1S77. ' Los Angeles re- :
I -ports to the Weather Bureau that the season '
. thus far Is the dryest since 1S63-94, when no
j rain fell during the whole winter.
'Otherwise there are no new features to the j

governed by the dry weather, and Reds, which '
are scarce and held by one house, the market
is now quoted weak. This market Is abJut 30c

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The market for table Potatoes continued act
ive at steady prices and dealers experienced no
difficulty In disposing of the best offerings at
full figure*. Â¦ The recent arrivals of Oregon
Burbanks, although not strictly first class,
were well cleaned out of first hands. Higher
prices would have been obtained had the stock
been of better quality. A car of Sweet Pota- !
toes was marketed and cleaned up quickly at
the recently advanced quotations. Onions ruled
firm at previous prices, and what little Oregon %
ttock was offered was quickly snapped up at
the top rate.
As usual on, Tuesday, the. receipts of'vegeta
bles from Los Angeles by rail weie light, but a
steamer which arrived on the preceding day
brought up several consignments and supplies
of most kinds were ample. String and Wax
Beans, Summer Squash. Egg Plant and Green
Peppers ruled firm at steady prices while
Peas and Tomatoes were lower. There was
very little inquiry for Tomatoes, owing to the
cool weather, and the light supplies proved ex
cess.ve. The other vegetables were plentiful
and unchanged.

very narrow margin of profit, but to no avail.
As previously mentioned the top quotation for
fancy -Navels was an extreme figure for a few

Nczc York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â The revival of anx
iety over the Far Eastern outlook made itself
felt in the yielding tendency in price* of stock*
again tf.-day as well as of cotton, while grains
consistently advanced. The effect -was more
noticeabif. homever. in the almost total killing
of speculative Interest. During- the afternoon
the stock market became -pfactiealljr stagnant.
The dribble of stocks' >was sufficient to cause a
flow doutiward tendency of prices, but' th'ere
was ar much lack of aggressiveness on the
part of the bears as of the bulls. In fact there
was evidence of some derire on the part -of the
bears to cover shorts in a few stocks. ThÂ«
borrowing demand for Pennsylvania in the loan
crowM pointed to an uncovered short interest.
**ic firmness of (bis dock in fa.ee of the dc* 1
presslon elsewhere caused some credence to be
given to the persistent rumors of a plan of ad
justment of points of antagonism being worked
cut In official consultations between the Penn
sylvania and the Wabash interests. There was
a demand for Amalgamated Copper, also to
cover shorts. The early firmness of this stock
was attributed lii part to the encouraging re
ports of trade conditions and especially large
foreign demand for copper and the large in
crease in foreign consumption judged by the
lack of impression upon European stocks made
by the large purchases of the last few month;-.
The movement In United States Steel preferred
was languid, but the volume of trading was
well maintained. The consumer of steel rails
was reported dissatisfied and holding back from
purchasing. The corporation's announcement
of the renewed offers to employes of preferred
stocks with privilege to receive a bonus" on
earnings and the reduction of the prtce to $55 a
share instead of 5 V 2 50, as in the preceding of
fer, was received with varied comments. The
poor response of yesterday's market to the fav
orable Far Eastern news was a subject of dis
appointed comment, giving rise to fears that
the abstention from the market of investors
and large buyers might have some, other mo
tive than the threatened war. The eaee of
money In face of tne call upon the Lake Shore
debenture bond syndicate for a 07!Â«i per cent
installment ef the $40,000,000 matured Lake
Shore notes gave assurance of no pressure upon
the money market on account of the listless at
titude of the buyers. The market cloved with
out effectual recovery.
Bond* were rather irregular. Total sales.

CHICAGO, Jan. 12.â A bullish sentiment
pen-aded the wheat pit. The market was
strong at the start. May -being up. %Â®u c to
viJSlc. at SI to 87%c. The principal Actors
influencing the situation at the openlne were
a decline In the Drice of British consols on a
renewal of war talk, firm foreign markets to
gether with lack of molstur* in the. Southwest
At the advance there was liberal proflt-takln*'"
which resulted in a setback of about half i
cent. The market steadied on heavy pur
chases by the big long interest. -Later in the
session a report was circulated: that Japan had
accepted Russia's counter-proposition, i This ru
mor started another velltnir movement on tho
part of the local traders. The desire to take
profits was intensified by a fairly large ln
creass In the world's visible stocks. Under this
selling pressure May declined to 86%c. A bet
ter export demand, with reports of rains, was
well . maintained and closing: prices showed
good gains. May pork opened- 17% to 22%c
higher at $12 00 to $12 05. sold between
$12 97% and $13 05, closing at $1.1 02%.' Lard

A better export demand with report of rains
soon caused a reversal of v sentiment. Prices
responded readily to the chanre. May ad
vanced to STiiesT 1 -;. The close was strong at
that ngure.
A war scare Induced considerable covering
by shorts in corn early in the day. May closed
â¢6c up at 47%c.
i A report that the prominent Ions was add
ing: to - his line brought out a general demand
for oats. May closed at 3S)%c. . .
Provisions were strong on lighter receipts
Of hogs, but more especially on renewed talk
of war. Shorts and commission houses were
active buyers early in the session, with offer
ings coming mostly from packers. The
strength manifested at the opening was well
maintained and closing â¢ urlces showed, good
gains.

JOHN PARTRIDGE.
The communication follows:
Editor The San Francisco DÂ»ar Sir:
1 notice In tnls morning's paper that th* hon
orable Mayor gchmltz Is published as having
said' that "the statemrot attributed to Mr.
Partridge I now denounce as a malicious llev"
This I understand was In reply to testimony of
mine frtven before a. -meeting- of * committee of
'the honorable Board of Supervlnors in regard
to his treatment of "the 'San Francisco Society
for the. Prevention of CrwMty to Animals and
his- appointing:, their nominee as pouiWkeoper.
In order that there may be no misunderstand
ing as to the question at Issue I will repeat
what I have before stated, that as one of- a
committee named by. the nocfety to call on
Mayor Schmltz I did. In the company of three
other Kentlomen, on the 2*th day of April. 1902.
call on the honorable gentleman at his office
in the City Hall and was nwÂ«t cordially re
ceived by him. Ills praise of the arrange
ment and. management of the Animals' Home,
where the city's pound was then conducted,
was most gratifying-. HÂ» then an-1 there re
peatedly promise u<i that he would do nothing
to interfere with am Institution so admirably
conducted and remarked that It was owing to
thÂ« fact that It was conducted by business men,
and further remarked that It was a great pity
that other offices In this building (the City
Hall) were not In the hands of business men.
Owing to- the suaden death of our pound
keener. Mr. Walton, we Informed his llonnf
that we would ask. his Indulgence for a few
days' time to select the proper man for the
place and asked . to have our secretary ap
pointed In the interim. Mr. fcrnmltz then ap
t>ointed 'our secretary and told him to, file a
bond the following morning. We. then shook
hands and left the office.
The next morning when our secretary called
on the Fame gentleman In the sajne place hÂ»
was told that he need not go to the expense
of filing a bond as he was about to appoint
a poundkeeper.
If, therefore-, the honorable gentleman is cor
rectly quoted as making the statement that he
never had a.ny conversation with me on the
su6ject I submit that I am not the liar Aid
furthermore I demand from him a full apology.
Referring to the statement that the pound
hag never been better and more fairly $yn
ducted than under his administration I would
refer him to the disgraceful quarters on thÂ«
San Bruno road and to the sworn testimony
ot Mr. Irwln. given by Mr. Irwin before the
same committee of the board, in which he
stated that the place had never been even
whitewashed during the time ne has occupied
it. and that he released many animals on
orders from th* Mayor's office/
This Is something that the Grand Jury
might act ui>on. Very respectfully.
* John Partridge says Mayor Schmitz
must apologize to him for declaring
that Partridge lied if he eiid the
Mayor told him the pound hajjl been
well conducted under the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
' Over his own siartature Partridge
reiterates his statement as to what he
says the. Mayor told him, stating: in
one portion of a communication writ
ten by him on the subject, "I submit
that I am not a liar and furthermore
I demand from him (the Mayor) a
full apology." ' . -
Reiterates Statement Over Signature
as to What He. Says Schmltz
Told Him.'
PARTRIDGE DECLARES THE
MAYOR MUST APOLOGIZE
. While we have balanced the books and are
enabled - to present to you the ; statements on
which we have been remarking, the books still
need a considerable amount of overhauling in
some particulars which do not bear on this de
falcation. - We notice, for â¢' Instance, that in
one of I the scholarship accounts the principal
sum and the income derived from It appear In
the same account, , as . also the > payments to
the beneficiaries of the scholarship. ; Aa a re
*ult the amount appearing In the balance
sheet is , Incorrect ; and misleading. The same
remark applies tr> the loan funds. â¢ s
. The recommendations ai to changes of sys
tem which, we hare. had the honor of making
to ' Â¦ the finance : Â¦ committee have . â¢ necessarily
been .enly of a "very general character.', and as
they have only .been considered . Incidentally, to
our Investigation of the books, we rare not yet
In a position to submit the forms 'and documents
which appear to be necessary and 7 which perhaps
are particularly needed' in the purchasing de
partment. (We *â¢ have â¢Â¦ suggested, Â¦ among . other
things, that the person In rhanre of. the. cash'
should be compelled to take vacations at stated
times; that the books should be so kept and the
financial statements : Â«>s prepared as to show
the: outsamilnc bills ana liabilities, and 'that
the business system should. b* placed as nearly
as -Dowible on the, footing of that: of* a 'large
' commercial â¢' enterprise. " ; â¢,:;Â¦' . â¢-â¢.. â¢â¢ â¢"..Â¦'â¢
. By the time that the,- remaining points- in
connection, -with the defalcation have been
cleared up and we are ready to report on them,
we shall be Â¦ prepared to > submit * at >th# . same
time the , outline of a. business * system- and'- a
!T1Â»e- deductions from the total credits-of the
scholarship - accounts renresent debit balances
and these dibit balances are caused by mis
appropriations;-excepting In the caSe of the
State of California* scholarships, which remain
intact. The amount standing at' the credit of
California Hall bids .represents I certain certi
fied checks which â¢ have been tendered -with
the bids eent In and these will be returned in
due course. The balance standing at the
credit, of W. A. McKowen â¢ is his available
bank balance at Berkeley, which he has hand
ed over to the university.'
' - It 'is useless â¢ to dwell upon -the ' chortcorri
ings of the system which is employed In, the
office or on" the lax as well as dishonest man
ner in which- the secretary's work has- been
done.. Among the cheeks and other, remit
tances amounting to several thousand dollars
which went : found' in the secretary's safe, and
in his desk there were some small money or
ders which had been held for a long time and
In many "instances we find that he kept checks
In his possession for many months and then
deposited them with the treasurer. This would
Indicate that he did , not finally convert ; the
money to his own use until he actually need
ed It. . â¢ - .
FAULTS OF THE SYSTEM.
- Referring to the balance sheet, the cash tn
th<Â» hands of the treasurer appears a* $8S,Â«
iJ.17 4'J. .but. as anoffset against this. ther<> is
an amount of o\-er $100,000 due to the treas
urer for advance payments made by him. This
advance, does not appear In the books of th$
university. hjthIii proving the inefficiency of th*
present system : of bookkeeping.
Â¦VVe are looking forward to. having a consulta
tion with the treasurer regarding a great many
matters before we finally report to you, and
we shall hope to suggest a means of incorpor
ating nil the transactions In the boks at th$
time when they occur. \
All the' savings bank depiisits. being th* In
vestments of crrtaln of the funds, have beÂ«n
found to be Intact. As to the asset in the
balance Â«hÂ«>et representing buildings, etc..
owned by th* university the deduction of $2000
from the total of thlo arises from the sale of
Oakland -Brooerty for $2000 more than the
amount at which the property stood In the
books, and the original value included certain
property In Alameda which is still unsold. The
debit of $-4032 -2.*Â», representing . the total of
donation, accounts, appears on thin sld* of the
balance .sh'et owing, to misappropriations af
fecting four of thfl accounts.. The account
representing \ a donation by ' Claus Spreck
els should have .appeared as $5749 87. "on the
other side of the accountants donation nf, $11,
673 83 having been withheld from this account
and credited to the department of medicine In
order that the latter â¢ should . not â¢ appear on
the books as having been, In receipt -of so f*w
funds, i r â¢ ,
The former statement appears to call for the
following remarks: The balance against the
department of anthropology appears as $19,-
IMil IS: The minutes show that Mrs. Hearst in
tended to support this department herself, but
it is proved that out of ? 12.822 00 already con
tributed by her $8,522 00 has been misappropri
ated. Thus, supposing the $Â£522 90 to be a loss
to the university, there will remain $11, 43s "5
for which it will presumably depend on the
generosity of Mr*. Hearst. ThÂ« matter Is men
tioned en account of Its bearing on the ulti
mate balance of. Income and expenditure ac
count t>f th* year. Â¦ â¢
Anothrr debit balance Is that of the depart
ment of medicine, which amounts to $17,
31S 47. The sum misappropriated from this de-
I'nritupiit was; $26,841 J2. so that the books
*hotild have shown funds on hand to the extent
of $Â»4!12 65. The "profit and ' loss" item,
$1732 01, is not nn accumulation of balances,
but a jpecifh 1 amount of two or three years'
standing, and' thn account called Â¦ revenue has
fulfilled the same function as does the profit
and inns arcount in the books of ordinary busi
ness enterprises.
To conclude our remarks on the income state
ment. we find that several minor adjustments
will have to be madÂ« In pom* of the Interest
accounts. Two dividends of $300 each, payable
In January, 1Â«>2. and in May. 1903. which have
never bcÂ»n called for by the university, are now
In course of collection. â¢ .
COIN* - MISAPPROPRIATED.
On beginning work on December 1Â«. 1M>3.
we found that the university ledger had
not been posted since June 30. 100 J.
and that the cash book had not been
written up, *o far as concerned money re
ceived. Fince AUKUst 31, lÂ»03. We thought it
best to leave. the hooka exactly a> they stood
and opened a temporary set in which we have
continued the entries up to December. 24. 1003.
The accompanying schedules marked B ana
"C" under 6<i>arate cover embody thÂ« income
and expenditure account from June 30 to ue
cember 1U. 1003, and the balance sheet or the
last mentioned date. Inasmuch as we, have
had to adhere to the old system, these ac^
counts represent the showing of the .boÂ° k jÂ» as
on November 30, 1903. with the addition of all
receipts of which any record can be fÂ°Â«Â»a
which had passed through the office of the
univerplty. ' . .
Before the accounts fell into arrears the s>Â«
tfm seems to have been that when the state
ments rendered monthly by the treasurer were
received at the office, then, and not till then,
the receipts of money during the month were
entered In the cash book, and. as has been al
ready Hated, these entries were made from a
distribution prepared by the secretary. *
These receipts included students' deposits,
fees and money received from other sources,
which had bcrn paid into the secretary's office
at Berkeley and later deposited wlfh the treas
urer; but It appears that the late secretary
never kept, any record of this In permanent
form, making his distributions, when the treas
urer's account came In. either from stubs of
receipts or loose memoranda or from memory-
Consequently seme little difficulty was found
in making the distributions to the proper ac
counts of the. treasurer's statements for Sep
tember. October and November, and our balance
sheet of December 24. J!*03, includes as a lin
billty a balance standing temporarily ac the
credit of suepense account. $31S3 S5. All of
this is in course of identifications. Most of it
has. in fact, been already disposed of and Tione
of It will affect the shortage, i
You will notice that neither in the income
statement nor In the balance sheet does any
account appear representing the shortage. In
other wqrds. these two statements represent ex
actly the showing of the books.
LEDGER NOT POSTED.
To the Regents of the University of Califor
niaâ Gentlemen: In accordance with your in
structions we have made an examination ot
the books of, the State University. This, as
wilt be seen from thÂ» report which we now
have the honor to submit. Is still incomplete
in certain particulars.
The accompanying schedule, which we have
marked "A," under separate cover, is a state
ment-of the defalcation of the late secretary,
which amounts to $51,429 23, si far as ascer
tained up ' to January 11. lÂ«04. We have
marked It â¢â¢Provisional," because it is barely
possible that additions may have to be made
to it when one of the benefactors of the uni
versity, whom it has been necessary to ask
for particulars, has , b?en heard from. we
have also to complete our examination or the
cash disbursements fr,om January 1. uH>Â».
which has proved far more arduous than we
anticipated. Only two men at a time can be
employed to advantage on thU work, and.
owing to th? defects of the system which has
been Dursued. this examination of the vouch
ers will not be concluded to our satisfaction
until about ten days hence. We have -very
little expectation, howtver. that this will in
any way alter the figures which we now pre
sent- to you, for the reason that thÂ« entire
shortage neems- -to have occurred through the
misappropriation of moneys received. Tne en
tries relating to- receipts, of cash' were -made
entlrtly from' particulars furnished to the
clerks in the ofrtce by the late secretary, and
this was never, done until the end of. each
month, when the treasurer's statement â¢Â»s re
ceived. Particulars of the disbursement, on
the contrary, were open . to the Inspection ot
those in the office and were written up In the
cash Jiook so soon as the warrants on the
treasurer were drawn. Our examination so rar
lias dlcclcsjd nothing? irregular in the entries
relating to disbursements, and . we have pur
posely left them to the rlast. '- Â¦ . . .â¢
For similar- reasons we have not yet veri
fied the payments representing students de
posits returned. These are Â¦ all In puty
amounts, and although the secretary signed
the checks, the details were .made ud by the
professors and the clerks" tn the office ana
were, finally - accepted as correct, by the stu-.
dents. â¢ â¢ -. â¢ Â¦
defalcation of W. A. McKowen was

ELABORATE SCHEDULE. ...
The schedule accompanying the re
port of the experts is an elaborate
document. Schedule A is a "pro
visional. statement of the. defalcation
of W. A. McKowen, secretary, so far
as ascertained, : up to January : 11,
1904." It contains a history of each
cheek, the number, date.^ the amount,
to 'Whom, payable and where deposited.
Some interesting facts are disclosed "in
the columrrof remarks. It -appears
that McKQwen took $6000 of the
$24,000 donated by D. O. Mills to the
Lick Observatory. The. donation of
$11,675 83 made bv Claus Spreckels
to the university was never credited as
a donation by Mr. Spreckels, .but was
credited on April 30, 1903, to depart
ment of medicine to conceal the short
age of funds in that account.
McKowen appropriated' to hfs own
uses the Levi Strauss scholarship,
Martha A Hallitaie donation, Alumni
Hall fund and Hearst scholarships.
Schedule B is a statement of the
income and expenditures. Schedule C
is, the balance-sheet, from which .it
appears that the university's mate
rial wealth on December 24, 1903, was
$3,481,723 47.
I AUDITOR LOSES SALARY.
The Regents decided that they would
not pay Auditor J. J. Herr any salary
for the - year 1903. The Â¦ discussion
brought out the statement : from the
finance committee that Auditor Herr
did not demand payment. He ad
mitted that he had not examined the
books of the secretary. , A resolution
declaring the office vacant was adopted.
Regents Taussig, Dohrmann and
Budd wanted to be informed whether
the finance committee had directed
Herr to expert the books of the sec
retary. , ... ' ' ''Â¦
Regent Foster replied that it was the
auditor's duty, to examine the accounts.
In the course* of the reply the Regent
resented the implication that 'the
finance -committee was . seeking to
shoulder the blame for McKo wen's de
falcation on the auditor.
' Regent Taussig, chairman. of the Wil
merdlng School ' committee, ' reported
that Monday, February, 8, would,be.ob
served at the school ' as Founder's 'da>v
There will be Interesting . exercises on
that occasion. ' '. \
The Regents,-âat the suggestion of
the finance committee," directed that the
mortgages and Insurance . policies now
In the secretary's office at Berkeley be
deposited with .the treasurer at the
Union Trust Company.
/Regent John E." Budd' moved that the
election of. a secretary, be -made a â¢spe
cial order Â¦ for the ' regular meeting > in
February, but withdrew the motion on
the suggestion o^ the finance committee
that no haste should be made.
EXPERTS REPORT.
Â¦ The following expert report on : the
ANOTHER FIGHT OX BONDS.
The university is the owner of fifty
three Montgomery avenue bonds. The
face value of each bond is $1000. The
interest computed amounts to as much
as the bond. It happens that the courts
have pronounced against the validity
of the bonds, and the university can
get neither interest nor principal on the
investment. The bonds were purchased
for the endowment fund many, many
years ago. There Is still a glimmer of
hope in the situation. S. W. Holliday,
lawyer, requests that" the bonds be
taken from the State treasury, where
they are now deposited 4or safe keep
ing, and placed in the Union Trust
Company. He engages to open up an
other battle in the courts and to sus
tain all the cost of litigation. If. he
loses the university will not suffer fur
ther loss, and if he wins the university
is to get half the par value pt the
bonds and all the accrued interest.
Some of the regents were of a mind to
propope thfee cheers for 'Holliday, but
no motion to the effect was made. The
proposition was accepted and the trans
fer of the bonds to the keeping of the
Union Trust Company was ordered.
At the session yesterday Dr. Rowell
was called to the chair. The rollcall
was responded to by President Wheel
er, John A.' Britton, I. W. Hellman, J.
B. Reinstein. Julius Taussig, Guy C.
Earl. John E. Budd, James A. Way
mire, Alden Andenson. F. W. Dohr
mann, Peter C. Yorke, Dr. Ellinwood
and A. W. Foster.
The proposed educational exhibit at
the St. IxiuiR Exposition was discussed.
President Wheeler rpported that 1600
square feet of space in the northwest
corner of the Building of Education
had been reserved for the exhibit of the
University of California. It was men
tioned that the expense of the exhibit
would be $3000. Regents Britton, Hell
man and Foster at once signified that
the money was not available. The
president was advised to hold on to the
space for thirty days. Lieutenant Gov
ernor Alden Anderson suggested that
application be made to . the California
Commissioners for means to malce the
exhibit.
He referred to the appropriation of
5130,000 at the disposal of the commis
sion to represent California at the ex
position. A motion requesting Dr.
Wheeler to hold the space for at least
a month flnaliy. prevailed.
It was announced that James D.
Angell. president of the University of
Michigan, would deliver the address at
Berkeley on" charter day. 'Â¦ Later on
Albert" Shaw, editor -of the Review of
Reviews, will speak on the "Morals of
Trade." -'; V ''.".-
The regents of the State University
met at Mark Hopkins Institute yester
day afternoon and . devoted consid
erable th..e to the work of es
tablishing defenses to prevent an
other successful raid on the treasury.
The cheerless intelligence was imparted
to the board by A. W. Foster, chairman
of the finance committee, that the Pa
cific Surety Company had refused to
make good its bond of $5000 to Insure
the good conduct of W. A. McKowen, the
defaulting secretary. In this case the
ground of refusal to pay is that the
board did not notify the company.of the
defalcation within three months after
the date of the bond's expiration. As
the regents did not know of the defal
cation until the time limit had expired,
the notice was not given. Allusions to
surety company methods In the general
Interchange of views were not compli
mentary. The board being well equipped
with good lawyers may. make things
decidedly interesting for the surety
company. There is a report to the ef
fect that the regents intend to raise the
money among themselves to-make good
the defalcation of the secretary, hence
it is probable that nothing will be left
undone to force the surety company to
pay $5000 a year for three "years.
A grand rally of all the/lawyers on
the board is to be held wnortly to con
sider the Turner mortgage. Among
those scheduled or invited to attend the
proposed conference are Regents Gar
ret W. McEnerney, Charles W; Slack,
Guy C. Earl. James A. Waymire,
Charles S. Wheeler and J. B.'Reinstein.
The* story is current that Major Mhoon,
as attorney of the board, neglected to
observe some little formality in the
loan of $40,000 of the university's money.
A mortgage on Turner's land in Merced
County was taken to secure the loan!
There is a muddle of some kind con
nected with the transaction and the
new attorney of the regents, Charles
E. Snook, is to be reinforced by the ag
gregate advice of all the legal lumina
ries of the regency.
