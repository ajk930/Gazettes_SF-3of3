And why? He looked back again at the

of end forgotten by the one, ill used
and i^ut in terror by the other. He

herself had
L>Â«.>:ids whereby a human being be
Â«.o:aes a roving, solitary brute. There
v.^is no rebinding them. Xobody would
come near her; nobody could endure
her presence; she was a thing, of
ltutred and of fear. Even Suzette
L'ligh shrank while she served, and
loathed while she ministered. Her
husband could not trust himself in
the house with her. and she could not
be trusted in the room with her chil
dren. By the narrowest luck she was
r.ot a murderess; in the hearts of all,
and in her own heart, she seemed a
leperâ a leper among people who were
wholeâ an unclean thingâ because; of
her bestial rage.
These thoughts had been in her
mind all the night before and all the
day. They did not consort with sleep
nor make terms with peaceful rest.
Sometimes they drove her to wild and
pass.ioi)Â£te outbursts of weeping and
imprecation; often they chained her
motionless to her chair, so still that
only her angry eyes showed life and
consciousness. They left the little
room for fear of any external punish
ment or for shame at any public ex
posure. They went deeper than that,
cor.Cernning not the body, ' but the
soul, pronouncing not the verdict of
the world, but of herself and of na
ture's inexorable law. They displayed
the progression of evil â weakness
growing to vice, vice turning to crime,
crime throttling: all the good^tili she
had become a thins: horrible to those
about her, horrible and incredible even
to herself. And there was no going
back, r.o coing back at alL Her will
was broken, and she had not hope in
herself. The weights were on her feet
and dragged her down the abyss, which
now l2y crpen and revealed before her
eyes.
Susette had persuaded her to un
dress and go to bed. She must sleep
â yes, or she would go mad with the
thoughts. But where was sleep with
the agony of their sting?, She had
her chloral â an old ally â and had re
course tp it. Then she would fling
herself on the bed and try .to think
she could Eleep. Exasperation drove
her up again and she paced the room
In wrathful despair, cursing herself
because ehe could not sleep, exclaim
ing against their tortures, refusing the
Inquisition to which they subjected
her.- Then â back to bed again for an
other futile effort, another cry of de
spair, to be followed by another out
burst of wild Impatience, another
fierce unavailing struggle against her
tormentors, new visions of what she
was and "of what her life must be.
This was not a thing that she would
endure; nobody could endure it and
keep Banity. -; It should be ended! Her
fierce, defiant fury rose yet once more;
the temper which had wrought all the
calamity was not tamed by it in the
end. Ehe turned to her druc again.
Ehe knew there -was - no danger In
that, bvl she put the notion behind
her scornfully. Why, the stuff -would
not even- make her. sleep! Could it
hurt her when It could not even give
her Bleep? .That waa nonsense, stupid
nonsense. She would haVe sleep. Na
ture fell victim to her, rage now; she
would beat nature down by her fury,
as rhe had been wont to beat down alÂ»
opposing -wills. She. had* listened to
nothing In her tempests.' .. Now she
ros* again to the whirlwind of passion,
denying what she knew, refusing , -to
look at IL Kill 1 , herself?* Not she!
Yet if ehe did. what â . matter?. Had
she anything to look' for in. life?
Would anybody grieve for her? It
Tvonld be a riddance for all of ; them
if she died. But she wouldn't die. No
danger of thatâ and no such luck,
either! Each fiose left her more pitiably
wide-awake, more gruesomely ;, alert
In mind, more hideously acute to*, feel
the sting of those torturirrg thoughts.
An overdose indeed! _ No "dose, â¢. it
seemed, could serve" even 'Mo dull the
sharpness of her mordant reflections.
But she would have" sleepsâ sat; all
costs, sleep! She cursed, herself vile
ly because she could not sleep.,'
Thus came, as of old, now?, for the
first time, the madness and blindness
of her rage, the rage which forgot all
pave itself, merged every other con
sciousness, spared nobody and noth
ing. It v.as turned against herself
now, and neither did it spare herself.
She drugged herself again, losing all
measure and then flung herself heav
ily on the bed. Ah! Yes. surely there
was a. change now? The horrid pic
tures grew mercifully dim. the sting
of the torturing thoughts was drawn,
the edge of conscience blunted. Her
rage had hud its way, it had beaten
down nature. For a moment she
grasped this triumph and exulted in
it in her old barbarous gloating over
the victories of her fury. All things
had been against her sleep. But now
it came; she had won it. She ceased
to move, to curse, even to think. The
blessed torpor stole over her. Her
life and what it must be passed from
her mind; a compassionate blankness
spread over her Intellect. She was at
peace! To-morrow â yes, to-morrow!
All things could wait now till to-nior
row. She would be better able to face
them to-morrc/tv â after a good night's
Who had dared to say shÂ«
could not sleep? Her eye.; closed and
her heavy breathing sounded through
the room. She stirred no more. Her
rage had Its way with her. ;is with all
others. It had demanded sleep. She
slept.
Dawn had broken when a h-ind laid
on his shoulder roused Grantley Ima
son from un uneasy doze. He found
Suzette by him in *h-;r dressing-gown
and baretooted. Instinctively he lis
tened for an instant to hear if there
were any Found from the room above.
There was none and he asked her:
"Is there anything wrong?"
"Yes," whispered Suzette. "Come
upstairs!" â -, -:.^-,;
Not knowing what the evil chance
might be, he followed her and she led
him into Harriet Courtland's room.
She had already opened one of the
shutters and the early light streamed
in on the bed. Harriet lay on her
side, with her head thrown back on
the pillow and her eyes turned up to
the ceiling. She lay above the clothes
of the bed and her nightgown was
torn away from her throat. Suzette
had thrown a dressing gown over her
body from breast to feet. She looked
wonderfully handsome as she lay
there, so still, so peaceful, like some
splendid animal, In a reaction .of ex
haustion after savage grand exertion.
He drew near. The truth came home
to him at once. The two stood and
looked at Harriet. At last he turned
to Suzette. He found her very pale,
but cuite calm.
"She's dead, Mr. Imason," , Suzette
said.
"How?" he asked.
"An overdose of chloral. She often
used to take itâ and of course she
would be very likely to want a sleep
ing draught last night."
"Yes, yes, of course she would. Her
nerves would be so much upset."
Their eyes met â Suzette's seemed
puzzled.
"What do you think?" asked Grant
ley in a whisper.
"I really don't . know. She would
really have been quite likely to take
too much. She would be impatient if
it didn't act quickly, you know."
"Yes, yes, of course Ehe would.
Have you sent for the doctor?"
"Oh, yes, directly I found her â be
fore I came to you. But I've done
some nursing andâ and there's not the
leastâ" She stopped suddenly, and
was silent for several seconds. Then
she said quietly and calmly: "There's
not the least chance, Sir. Imason."
Grantley knew what word she had
rejected in favor of "chance," and
why the word had seemed inappropri
ate. He acknowledged the justice of
the change with a mournful gesture of
his hands.
"Well, we can never know whether
it was accidental or not," he said, as
he turned to leave the room.
"No, we can never know that," said
Suzette. â¢
How should they know? Harriet
Courtland had- not known herself. As
always, so to the end, her fury had
been blind, and had destroyed her
blindly. She had struck at herself as
recklessly as at her child; and here her
blow had killed. Her rage had run
its final course, and for the last time
had its way. She slept-
And while Ehe slept, her home was
waking to the life of a new day.
CHAPTER XXIV.
Picking .Up the Pieces.
The calamity at the : Courtlands'
struck on all their acquaintance like a
nip of icy wind, sending a shudder
through them, making them, as it were,
huddle closer about them the protecting
vesture of any hope or any happiness
that they had. The outrage on the
child stood out horrible in the light of
the mother's death: the death of the
mother found an appalling explanation
in the child's plight. Whether the
death were by a witting or an unwit
ting act seemed a small matter; dark
ness and blindness had fallen on the
unhappy woman before the last hours,
and somehow in the darkness she had
passed away. There was not lacking
the last high touch of tragedy; the
catastrophe which shocked and awed
was welcome too- It was the best
thing that could have happened. Any
end was better than no end. . To , such
a point of "hopelessness- had matters
ccme, in such a fashion Harriet Court
land had used her life; " The men : and
women* who'had* known 'her.Ther >klo-~
dred, her friends '. and ,her household,
all whom nature' had designed to love
her, while they shuddered { over the
manner of her going, sighed with relief
that she waa gone. The decree . of
fate, had filled the â  page, and it was
finished;, but- their j minds still r tingled
from it as - they " turned to the^clean
eheet and prayed a kinder/message.

to vulgarity, which 'he had carried
away from his encounter .'with Walter
Blake. To all. this Beemed* one
clue; through it all' one thread, ran.
He felt this in the recesses of his mind,
and his fingers groped ? after the,guid
ing line. That rrt;ust be. found. - lest,
treading blindly through the, labyrinth,
he and his too should fall into the pit
whence there was no upward way.
They had been half over the brink
once; a preternatural . effortâ so it
might properly; be calledâ had pulled
them back; but they "were still on the
treacherous incline. â¢ ' â¢ -
Out of his' sbmber-and puzzled re
flections there* 5 sprangâ suddenly as it
seemed, and in ans\ver to his/cry -for
guidanceâ an,; enlightening pityâ pity
for his boy,' lest he al^ps^hould... bear
on his brow the scar of hatred, almost
as plain to see as the visible mark
which was to. stamp little Sophy's - for
evermoreâ and pity for Sibylla, because
her empt'y heart had opened to so poor
a tenant; in very hunger she had turn
ed to Blake. He no longer rejected the
hope of communion with the Immature
infantile mind of his son; he ceased to
laugh scornfully at a, love dedicated
to such a man as Walter" Blake. A
new sympathy with his boyâ even such
as he had felt for Tom Courtland's lit
tle girlsâ spurred him. to fresh efforts
to understand. I Contempt for his wife's
impulsive affections gave: way to com
passion as his mind 'dwelt not'on what
she had done; but on what had driven
her to do itâ as he threw back his
thoughts from the unworthy satisfac
tion her heart had sought to the straits
of starvation which -had made any sat
isfaction seem so good. This was to
look, in the end, at himself, and to the
task of studying himself he was now
thrust back. If he could not do that,
and do it to a purpose, desolation and
pitiableness such as he had witnessed
and shuddered at stood designated as
the unalterable future of his own home.
Then, at. last;. he was Impatient;: his
slow persevering Â» campaign was too
irksome, â  and success : delayed seemed
to spell failure. The time comes when

repeated.

"You seem . very .cheerful." she re
marked, with an accusing air.
'â  "No, I'm not that: exactly: but I've

"Any change does that," Christine
admitted wasplshly.
"I saw John for a minute. He looked
a bit worried. - Does he complain?"
"He hasn't complained to me."
"Oh, then it's all right, I suppose.
And he says the business is all right,
anyhow. How's the boy?"
"As merry and jolly as he can be." '

Grantley's only answer was a reflect

she went on. "Is he with the children?"
"No, he's living at the club."

"Are you quite .sure you understand

"Meanlngithe woman? Oh, no! She'a
difficult.,: But I understand that, when
one failed utterly, you don't
risk. much .by trying another."
They came to the top of the hill
which runs down. to Milldean. Christine
sighed. ;.
â¢ "Poor old Harriet!- She was a' jolly
girl once, you know, and so handsome!
I've had some good times with Harriet.
Do you think she is at peace, Grant
ley?"
"She has paid," said he. "She has
paid, for what she was and did. I hope
she's at peace."
Christine's eves grew dreamy; her
voice fell to a gentle murmur.
"I worder if it's nulte silly to fancy
that she's paid something for some of
us too, Grantley? I waa thinking some
thing like thatâ somehowâ when I said
â¢Poor old Harriet!' "
"I daresay it's silly, but I don't know
that it seems so to me," he answered.
Just once again he felt the tiny vel
vety touch. So they came to Milldean.,
The twofold pity which had roused
Grantley from a lethargy of feeling,
misconceived as self-control, had its
counterpart in the triple blow with
which the course of events assailed
Sibylla's estimate of herself. In the first
place; the news about young Blake
announced in Janet Selford's letter â
indirectly indeed, but yet with a cqnfl
dent satisfaction â made her ask wheth
er her great sacrifice had been offered
at a worthy shrine, and her great offer
ing received with more than a shallow
and transitory appreciation. In the*
second, the thought and image of the
Courtland children spoke loud to the
instinct which hsr ideas had lulled to
sleep, bitterly accusing her desertion
of the child and her indifference to his
fate, rousing hsr ever underlying re
morse to quick and. vengeful life. Last
ly, she was stirred to see and rec
ognize the significance of the third turn
of fate â the meaning of tha nemesis
which had fallen on Harriet Courtland:
how she had let her rage spare nothing,
neither self-respect, nor decency, nor
love: and how, in the end. thus en
throned in tyranny, it had not spared
herself. The three accusations, each
wi^h its special Import, each taking
up a distinct aspect of the truth and
enforcing it with a poignant example,"
joined example, joined their indictments
into one, and, thus united, cried out
their condemnation of her, taking for
their mouthpiece Christine Fanshaw's
pretty lips, using her daintily scorn
ful voice, and the trenchant uncompro
mising words from which the utterer
herself had afterward recoiled as too
coarse and crude to be a legitimate
weapon of attack. The logic of events
was not so squeamish: It does not deal
In glosses or in paraphrase; It Is blunt,
naked and merciless, and must be, since
only when. all other appeals and.warn
ings have failed does its appointed work
begin. It fastened with what almost
seemed .malicious glee on Christine's
biting word, and enforced It by a piti
less vividness of memory, an unceasing
echo in Sibylla's thoughts. Her emo
tions had gone "sprawling" over every
thing. The description did not need
elaboration. It was abominably ex
pressive and sufficient. And it did not
admit of pleading or of extenuation.
It showed her touching, on one extreme.
Blake's shallow and spurious senti

license of anger. It pointed her at
tention to the ruin of Tom's life, to the
piteous plight of his children, to Har
riet's fate, to Blake's facile forgetful
ness of love too heedlessly and wanton
ly offered. It stripped her fantastic
ideas of their garish finery, leaving
them, in the revulsion of her feelings,
bereft of all beauty and attractiveness.
Impelled to look back, she seemed to
find the sams trail over everythingâ
even in those childish days of which
Jeremy Chiddingfold had once given
a description that would not have re
assured her; even In the beginning of
her acquaintance with Grantley, in
the. ready rapture of her first love, in
the intoxication of the fairy ride.
Changing its form, now hostile to her
husband instead of with him, the same
temper. showed in all the events which
led up to the birth of little Frank: its
presence proved that her madness over
Blake was no isolated Incident, but
rather the crown of her development
and the truest interpreter of a char
acter empty of worth, strength, or sta
bility. Many bitter hours brought her
to this recognition; but when light
came, the very temper she condemned
was in her still, and turned the cool
ness of recognition and analysis Into
an extravagant heat of scorn and self
contempt. - .
What was the conclusion? "Was she
to throw herself at Grantley's feet,
proclaiming penitence, Imploring par
don, declaring love? "No, no!" she
cried. That would be so easy, so short
a cut, so satisfying to her roused feel-

devil in a new disguise. Her love for

character, yet of present mood. Each
sought and desired something of what
had appeared to- deserve reprobation

to ah extreme,- had threatened ruin;
they erected' the opposite temper of

seemed strange, yet it was the* natural

ments which they had seen woTked out
and displayed â  before their " eyes, in
such close touch with them, impinging
so sharply on their own destinies.
Sibylla had not been at home when
Grantley arrived. " She met him first
in. the nursery. -when she went to seo
little Frank at his tea: No mood, ba

him. But to-day he played with his
son ; with a new sympathy;* talked to
him .with a pleasant gravity! which
stirred the youth and curious mind;
listened to his broken utterances with
a kindly quizzical smile which seemed
to encourage the little fellow.- Grant

weeks bring at such a time of life. He

covered the road to understanding

without doubt, enjoying one another's
society when Sibylla came in. *â¢
She stood In the doorway, waiting
with an aching heart for the usual
thing, , for a withdrawal of even such
sijn of interest as Grantley had ever
shown in old days. It did not come.
He gave her a cheery recognition, and
went on playing with â  Frank. Irre
sistibly drawn, she came near to them.
Something was- .signaled In. Frank's

asking for an explanation. The nurse
had gone into the other room,' busied
about the preparations for the msal.
Sibylla took Frank in her arm?.
"I know what he means."- she said
proudly.
Her eyes met Grantley's. His wera
fixed very intently on her.
* "I -don't," he 'said. "Is it possible
for a man to learn these myaterles?"
His tone and words were light: they
were even mockins:, but not now with
the mockery which hurts.
She flushed a little.
"You'd like to lqarn?" she asked.
"Shall we try to teach him, Frankâ to
teach him your, cede?". .
"1*11 watch you With him." ,.
For a. moment she looked at him ap
pealingly, and then knelt, on. the floor
and arranged the toys as Frank had
wanted them. The little fellow laughed
in triumph.
"How did you know?" asked Grant
ley..-,', ,â â â â 
"I've not lost that knowledge â no. I
haven't." she answered almost in a
whisper.
The scene was a spur to his newly
stirred impulses.. He had- rejoiced In
his wife before how; but the clouds
had always hung about the cot. so that
he had not rejoiced nor gloried in the
mother of his child. His heart/was full
as he sat and watched the mother and
the- child.
"You've got to watch him very care
fully still; but' he's getting; ever so
much more â more-r- *-'*
"Lucid?" Grantley suggested, smil
ing. BM
"Yes," she laughed, "and., if possi
ble, more Imperious still. I believe he's
going to be like you in that." â¢
"Oh. not like me, let's hope!"
He laughed, but there was a look of
pain on his face.
Sibylla turned round' to him and
spoke in a low voice, lest by chance
the nurse should hear.
"You mustn't be sure I agree alto
gether with that." she said, and turned
swiftly away to the child again.
Grantley rose.
"Lift him up to me and let- me kiss
him," he said.
With grave eyes Sibylla obeyed.
But the natural man is not easily
subdued, nor does he yield hU place
readily. In the end Grantley ,was not
apt at explanations or apologies." The
evening fell fair and still, a fine 7 : Oc
tober night, and he Joined Sibylla In
the garden. Christine remained inslda
âfrom tact, perhaps, though she, was
very likely chilly, too. Grantley smoked
in silence, while Sibylla looked, down
on the little village below.
"This thing has shaken me up dread
fully." he said at last. "The Court -
lands, I mean."
"Yes, I know."- She turned and
faced him. "And Isn't there something
else that concerns you and me?"

hardly say the Courtlands concern U3

"They do; and there is something

Selford wrote."
"That's nothing at all , to me."
"But it is somethlns to me. You
know it is."
"I won't talk of that It's nothing."
He put his hand out suddenly to her.
"Let's, be friends. Sibylla.".
She did not take his hand. , but she
looked at him with a friendly 'gaze.
. "We really ought to try to matt a se

"It'll be hard; but' we'll try to be

"That's . good, but is that all?", he
asked in a low voice full of feeling.

with which he had looked on the boy

miss the expression of it.
"Is that the best we can try for?"
he whispered. "There was something*
else once, Sibylla."
He had not moved, yet she raised her
hands as though to check or beat off
Ms approach. She was afraid. All that
the path he again beckoned her on had
meant to her came to her mind. If she
followed him along it would it not be
<jnce more to woo disillusionment, to
court disaster, to Invite that awful
change to bitterness ana hatred?
"You are you and 1 am I," she pro

squareness as he heard her.

"I !1 try to l>e friends. We can' Under

"You have no love left for me?" he
asked, passing by her protests.
"For months past I've hated you."
"I know thai. And vou have no love

She looked at him again, with fear
and shrinking in her eyes.
"Have you lor;;oiten what I did? No,

be horrible for lÂ«jth of us. You may

"The past is the part," he said calm

so, he saw lh.it the was in strong ab

"That's enough to-night â enough for

"Only 1 had to tell you what was in

"How could you, Grartley?"
"I haven't said it was easy. I'm
coining to believe that the easy things
aren't worth much."
"You could love me again?"
"I've never ceased to love you.â only
I hope I know a bit more about how
to do it now."
She stood there, the picture of dis
tress and vf fear. At last she broke
out:
"Ah. I've not toJd you the real thing!
I'm afraid, Grantley, I'm afraid! I dare
not love you. Because I loved you so
beyond all reason and all â all sanity,
all this came upon us. And â and I

"Friends, friends. Grantley!" she im
plored. "Then we shall be safe. And
our love shall be for Frank. You'll get
to love Frank, won't you?"
"Frank and I are beginning to hit it
off capitally," said Grantley cheerful
ly. "Well. I shall go in now; we mustn't
leave Christine alone all the evening."
He took her hand and kissed it. "So
â¢we're friends?" he asked.
"I'll try," she faltered. "Yes, surely
\v<- can manage that!"
He turned away and left her again
ga'^ng down on â  the village and Qld
Mill House. He lounged into the draw
irg*.-oom where Christine sat, with an,
easy air and a smile on his face.
!"A beautiful evening, isn't it?" asked
hristine with a tiny shudder, as she
itched her chair closer to the bit of
right fire and threw a faintly protest
ig glance at the open window.
"Beautiful weather â and quite set
-.ed. I shall enjoy my holiday down
here."
"Oh. you're going to stay down here,
and going to have a holiday, are you?"
the asked with a. lift of her brows.
"Well, hardly a holiday, after all.
I've got a job to do," he answered as
fct lit his cigarette. "Rather a hard job
at my timf of life."
"Is it? What is the job?'.*
"I'm going courting againâ and a
very pretty woman too." he said.
A rather tremulous smile came on
Christine's face as she looked at him.
"It's rather a nice amusement, isn't
it?" she asked. "And you always had
plenty of self-conceit."
"Why, hang it, I thought it was just
the opposite this time!" exclaimed
Grantley in whimsical annoyance.
Christine laughed.
"I won't be unamiable- I'll call it
self-confidence, if you insist."
He took a moment to think over her
new word.
"Yes, In the end I suppose it does
come to that. Look here, Christine; I

ought to change your nature would be

Christine's answer might be consid
ered encouraging.
"After all there's no need to over
do the change," she said. "And there's
one thing in which you'll never change;
ycu'll always want the best there is."
"No harm In having a try for Itâ

CHAPTER XXV.
Picking Up the Pieces.
Mrs. Bolton was very much upset by
what had happened at the Courtlands'.
An unwonted and irksome sense of re
sponsibility oppressed her. She dis
cussed the matter with Miss Henderson
tnd made Caylesham come to see her
âMiss Pattie Henderson, who knew all
about how Sophy's letter had reached
her mother's hands, and Caylesham,
â¢whom Mrs. Bolton had made a party
to the Joke. It did not seem so good a
Joke now. She and Pattie were both
frightened when they saw to what their
pleasantry had led. Little Sophy's suf
fering was not agreeable to think of,
and there was an uncomfortable cer
tainty about the manner of Harriet's
death. A scheme may prove too suc
cessful sometimes. Caylesham had
warned Mrs. Bolton that she was play-
Ing with dangerous tools. He was not
now inclined to let her down too easily,
nor to put the kindest interpretation
on the searchlngs of her conscience.
"You always time your fits of morali
ty bo well." he observed cynically. "I
don't suppose poor old Tom's amusing
company Just now, and he's certainly
deuced hard up."
Mrs. Bolton locked a very plausible
picture of injured Innocence, but of
course there was something . In what
Frank Caylesham said; there generally
was. though it might not be what you
would be best pleased to find. Tom was
not lively sor inclined for gayety; and
he had Just made a composition with'
his creditors. On the other hand, Miss
Henderson was In funds (having com
pleted her negotiations with the Par
menter family), and had suggested a
Winter on the Riviera, with herself for
hostess. There are, fortunately, mo
ments when the good and the pleasant
coincide; the worst of it Is that such
happy harmonies are apt to come rather
late In the day.
"It's all different now that woman's
gone." observed Mrs. Bolton. "it's the
children now, Frank." â¢ â 
"Supposing it Is, why am I to be
dragged Into it?"
"We must get him to go back to
them."
Various feelings combined to make
Mrs. Bolton very earnest.
"He wants to stay here, does*he?"
- "No; he hates being here now. .Yes,
he does. He only comes : because he's
got nobody else to speak to. And he's
In awful dumps all the time. It's not
very cheerful for me."
"I dare ' say not, Flora. 'But why
doesn't he'go back; then?" â â -'â 'â ' â â ;â â 'â¢ â¢
Mrs. Bolton 'had been, moving- about
the room* restlessly. Her back-was to
Caylesh^m as she answered:- ..' :â  \ ,. -
"He - won't. . He says i he ; "can't. : He
says 1",' ,, //â¢/ ' r '" ,
Caylesham threw a glance at' her, his
brows raised. ... , - â¢ ., ",
"What does he say, Flora?/'..
"Oh, it's* nonsense â and he* needn't
say it to me. anyhow. It really isn't
particularly pleasant for me. .Oh.iwell,
then, he says he's not fit .to go near
them." She turned round to him;
there was a flush- on her. face.. "Such
nonsense!" she ended impatiently.- -"â â â¢
Caylesham pulled his mustache and
.smiled reflectively. "â¢ - ; '-
"I suppose it might take him like
that," he observed with an impartial
air. ~:~-\ : ;s , â â¢â â¢:â¢â¢.â 
"Oh. I know you're only laughing 'at
me! Tut I tell you,, I don't like it,
Frank." '
"Those little incidents are â well, inci
dental. Flora. Innocent children, you
know! And 1 shouldn't be surprised if
he even mcide excuses'^ for Harriet
now?"
"Xo, be doesn't do that. It's the chil
dren. Stop smiling like that, will you?"
' "Certainly, my dear Flora. My smile
was a pure oversight." i
"It was all I could do to' get him to
go to ihe funeral. Do you think she
killed herse!f. : Frank?"
"I've not the least intention of exam-,
ining the Question. What can "it mat
ter?" "
Mrs. Bollnn shrugged her
impstier.tly. it did seem to her ;to
matter, but she would not let Cayle
shaxii think th?.t it mattered much.
She returned to her point about the
children.
"He's miserable. thinking about them,
and yet hÂ« won't co near them. I call
it idiotic."'
"So cto I. Eut then ther aren't our
children."
"Well. I'm not going to stand his
saying it apfain and again to me."
"I reallv agree. There can't be any
reason for saving suchta thing more
ihSn once."
She broke into a vexed laugh.
"When you've had all the fun you
can got out of me, pc-rhaps you will be
gin to help me. You see. I want it set
tled. I want to be off to Monte with
Pattip."
"I see. You want to co with Pattie
and " t . -
Mrs. Bolton shook her "head.
"Just vou And Pattie?"
"She's going to stand it to me; I
haven't got a farthing. And, I say,
Frank, he ought to go back to those
poor little wretches now. You can
make him do it if you like, you know.''
"I? Well. I'm an odd sort of party
for such a job."
"Not a b'.L He'll listen to you just
because â well, because- "
"I haven't spared your feelings,
Flora, don't mind mine."
"Because he knows you don't talk
humbug or cant."
"You're being complimentary after
all â or at any rate you're meaning to
be. And you'd never see him again?"
"He'll never want to see me." She
was facing Caylesham now. "I've been
fond of poor old Tom. Come, you know
I have? Say that for me."
"Yes, I know you have. I've reproved
you for it myself."
"But he'll not want to see me â and
soon 1 shan't want to see him either."
She looked -a little distressed for a
minute, then shrugged her shoulders
with u laugh:
"That's the wav of the world."
"Of part of it," Caylesham murmured
as he lit a cigar.
But he was really sorry for Mrs. Boi
ton. Notwithstanding a. notable mix
ture of motives, in which the condition
of her purse and the opportunity of go
ing to the Riviera. figured largely, she
was grieved at the" wav in which her
friendship with Tom was ending
grieved that it must end. and hurt that
Tom should desire to have it ended.
She had always suffered from this un
fortunate tendency to kindly emotions
which the exigencies of her position did
not permit her to Indulge. Indeed it
was very likely the kindly emotions
which had originally produced the po
sition. This did rot make the matter
any better; the ultimate incongruity
was none the less undesirable. With
his indifference to accented codes,
Caylesham thought it rather lament
able, too. Still she did want, above all
things, to so to the Riviera. with Pat
tie Henderson. One must compromise
with life, and it was not clear that she
was getting the worst of the bargain.
With Flora Bolton set aside (and
of course she had no reasonable
title to consideration), the . case
Feemed a simple one to Caylesham,
and his mission an obvious utterance
of common sense. He could not enter
fully into Tom Courtland's mind. Tom
was not naturally a lawless man; des- 1
peration had made him break loose.
The by-gc-ne desperation was forgotten
now in pity for his children and for tha
woman whom, after all, he had once
loved; *and he looked with shame on
the thing he had done, attributing to it
all the results which Harriet's fury had
engrafted on it. Broken in fortune and
in career, broken, too, in self-respect,
he had been likely to drift on In a life
which he had come to abhor. He felt
his presence an outrage on his chil
dren. If the death of his wife had
seemed to save him from a due punish
ment, here was a penalty different, but
hardly less severe. While he was in
this mood Caylesham was the best man
to carry the message to him. The only
chance -with Tc-m was to treat what he
had done as natural, but to Insist that
the sequence of events was utterly un
expected and essentially unconnected
with It. To urge the gravity of his of
fense would have been to make repara
tion and atonement impossible. Cayles
ham took a very strong and simple
line. He declined to discuss the state
of Tom's' conscience, or the blackness
of Tom's mind, or. even the whiteness
of the minds of the children. Every
body was very much alike, or would
be in a few years, anyhow, and Tom
was not to be an ass.' The line of argu
ment was not exalted, but . it was
adapted to the needs of the case."
"My dear chap,. if you come to that,
what man Is fit to look his children in
the face?" he asked Impatiently.
But then it occurred to him that he
was idealizingâ a thing he hated.
"Not that - children aren't' often
wicked little beggars themselves," he
.added 'cheerfully. "They steal and lie
like anything, and torment one another
devilishly. I know I did things as a
boy that I'd kick any grown man for
doing, and so- did my brothers and sis
ters. I tell you what it is, Tom, the
devil's there all the time; he . shows
himself in different waysâ that's all."
Tom could not swallow this gospel;
he would give up neither, his own
iniquity nor the halo of purity to which
his mind clung amid the sordid ruin
of his life and home.
"If I could pull straight "he mur
mured despairingly. V
"Why shouldn't you? You're getting

"Theyâ they guess \ something about
it, I expect, Frank. It's ,. not pleasant
for a man to be ashamed before .' his
own . children. . . And ; Miss . j Bllghâ I
thought she looked at me very queerly
at the funeral."
"You'll find, they'll be as : nice as pos

to be on your. side. Women always are,
you know. They're : hot naturally, moral

always like to get an excuse for ap

"Never ' mind my .- thoughts, i old * chap.

though Suzette assured him that some
thing-could., easily be. prepared ,(and
that-homely sort of attention ,was,new
and .pleasant to 'Tom), he accepted
John Fanshaw's invitation to , take pot
luck wltjr him. They walked off to
gether,-rather silent, each full of his
own thoughts. They did not speak un
til "they "had almost " reached John's
door. '
â¢."That's the sort of sight, that makes
a man wish he had children," said John
slowly..
'"I'.ve often wished I had none. Poor
Harriet!" _,
"But you're glad of them, now?"
"Why, I've nqthing else! "It just
makes â¢ the difference to life." He
paused a moment, and then broke out:
"And they've nothing but love' for me.
Not a word, not a thought of reproach!
Just because. I've 1 never been -cruel to
them, whatever else I've been! Poor
little beggars. We can't keep like that
when ;\ve' grow up. We're too fond of
our grlevdteces, eh ?"
. John I looked fat him for a moment,
but said nothing. They went into the
house in renewed ' silence. . It seemed
very large, 'empty and dreary.
â¢"Your wife not back yet? I heard
she' was staying with the Imasons."
â¢'She's there 'still. I don't know
when she's coming back."
"Rather dull for you. Isn't It? You
know you always depended on her a
lot." SStfHBSaKBBBHHHi
John made no answer, but led the
way into his study. -He gave, Tom an
evening paper, and began to open hia
letters. But his thoughts were not on
the letters. They were occupied with
what he had seen taat afternoon ana
Avith 'the words which had fallen from
Tom Courtland's lips. The children
forgave, with that fine, free forgiveness
which -will: not even recognize the need
?or itself or the. existence of any fault
toward v/hich it should be exercised.
It is there that forgiveness rises to and
is merged in love. But when people
grow up. Tom had said, they are too
fond of their grievances. John had
been very fond j of his grievance. It
was a fine large one â about the
largest any man could have; every
body must admit that; and John l\ad
declined to belittle it or to shear off
an inch of its imposing stature. All
itT demanded he had given. But had
he? -What about Frank .Caylesham'a
money? Had it not demanded there
something which he had refused? But
he- had. given all it asked so far as the
sinner who had; caused it was con
cerned. Against' her he had nursed
and cosseted it; for its sake he had
made hfs home desolate and starved
his heart. Aye, he had always de
pended on Christine! Tom was
right. But because of his grievance
he "had put her from him. He v.-as
fond of his grievance Indeed! If Tom's
children had been old enough to
recognize the " true value and pre
ciousness . of a big grievance, they
would never have received Tom as
they had that afternoon; they would
have. made him feel what he had been
guilty of. He would have been made
to: feel it handsomely before he was
forgiven. Children were different, as
.Torn Courtland said.
John got' up and poked the fire
fiercely. - . -
"The house is beastly cold!" he
grumbled.
â¢ "Ah, it wouldn't be. if Mrs. John
was v at home!" laughed Tom. "She
always looks after the fire, doesn't
she?"
' John Fanshaw bitterly envied . him
â¢his peace -and happiness. He forgot
how hardly they had been achieved.
The : vision of the afternoon was be
fore his' eyes, and .he declared that
fate " was : too kind to' Tom. A heavy
dullness, was over his -face, and a
forlorn' puzzled look in his eyes. He
must .have : done" right.! he must be
doing ; right! : How. could a self-re
specting man do otherwise? And yet
' he was so desolate, so starved of hu
man love,, in the end so full of. long
ing â  for Christineâ for her gracious
presence 'and her dainty little ways. â¢
* With an effort he recollected his*
'thoughts . from these .wanderings, and
began to read his letters. Tom was
still occupied with his *paper and his
cigar; but he" looked up at the sound
of an "Ah!" which escaped from
John's lips. John had come on a let
ter which set his thoughts going
againâ a letter from Sibylla. She up
braided him playfully for not having
come down to see them and Christine.
' "I'm sure Christine roust be hurt
with you, though she's much too
proud to say so. We want to keep
her. over Christmas. Will you some
as soon as you can and stay over
Christmas and as long as possible?.
-I've not. told her I'm asking you, so
that she mayn't be disappointed if you
can' f come." . -JHSMSBB
. There -was diplomacy ( in Si
bylla>-.' letter.' since she knew
the" state, of the case far
better than. her references to Chris
tine, implied. .,'
. But John'was not aware of this. His
attention : was fixed only on the Invita
tion' and o/n- the circumstances in
which .itrcaihe. He could not go to
Milldean and take his grievance with
himritwas too big and obstrusive for
other people's houses â It could flour
ish properly only in a domestic tete-a
tete. So he must stay at home. He
sighed "as 'â  he laid' "down the letter.
Then his fingers wandered Irresolutely
to it again as he looked across at Tom
Courtland,. who had now ceased read
ing and was smoking with a quiet
smile on his face. :
"Anything old fellow?" asked
Tom, noting the gravity of his expres
sion. - .
"No. It's only, from Mra. Imason,
asking me to go down there at Christ
mas."
"You go!" counseled Tom. "Better
than bringing your wife back here."
..'S There was a third courseâ^the
course favored by the grievance/John
did. not speak of it. but it wan present
in his thoughts. He shook his head
impatiently and began to talk of gen
eral-topics; but all the evening
Sibylla's letter was in . mind, ranging
itself side by side with the scene which
he' had" witnessed at .Torn Courtland's.
. gloomy idol he had set up in his
heart' was not yet cast down. But the
little .hands of the children had given
its pedestal a shake.
CHAPTER XXVI.
The Great Wrong.
r , f.The" Rayrnores were lodging over the
postofBce : at Milldeani in the rooms
once occupied by/the curate. v The new
curate did not need them; he was stay
ing at the rectory, arid meant, after his
marriage with .Dora Hutting, to build
himself .".a house,/ go on being
curate "arid ultimately,' be rector." He" had
a .well-to-do father, who had - bought
the advowson 'for. him as a wedding
p'resent: : ,Hi3 path 'in ; life â¢ was clear,
visible f to .. the very end, , and entirely
peaceful-sunless Dora .decided other
%vise.; So the .rooms- came in handy
for - . the â  Raymores, ; : ~~ and it. suited
Jeremy's .inclination*- and leisure to
stay" the Awhile ' with * his â  sister â¢ on - the
hill. A He; had ' bit 'of work to finish
down at T Milldeari7*while*the*Ra'ymore3
were- there.' However^ assiduous 'you
may be, i loye-riiaking in London- is
'liabje" to'-iriterfuptloh;<it;must':be ; t6 a
certain "degree j spasmodic ' thereT-^busi
ness,*-; society and such "like trifles keep
breaking* in. . A^cTear week in the
country ...will do
thought ? Jeremy, arid^it was,,his"bril
liant^ suggestion which brought the
Raymores to Milldean for a month.
What more obvious, since Charley was
to- land at Fair haven- and to stay a
month in England?- Spend that month
in London, where things interrupted
and people started and- old-time talk
was remembered? No! Kate Ray
more jumped at the idea that this
wonderful, month should 'be spent In
the country, in quiet and seclusion,
among old friends whose lips would
b*Â» .guarded, whose looks friendly,
whose hearts in sympathy. BEM3
When Jeremy made this arrange
mentâso excellent _Â«t one that
he may . be pardoned for al
most forgetting the; selfish side of It
he had .not failed to remember Dora
Hutting. There had always been alter
native .endings to that story. Jeremy's
present scheme was a variation from
both of them. None the less, he had
come decidedly to prefer it to either.
But. he had not 'â¢ allowed for the pres
ence-of the curate: and this circum
stance, casually brought to his knowl
edge by Grantley Imason'on the even
ing of his arrival, had rather disturbed
him. There was another feature In the
case for which he was quite unpre
pared. The name of the curate was a
famous one â actually famous through
the length and breadth of the land!
This was rather, a staggerer for Jere
my, who might deride but could not
deny the curate's < greatness. Certain
forms of glory may appeal more to one
man than to another, but all are glori
ous. The curate was' Mallam of Som
erset.
"The Mallam?" asked Jeremy.
"Yes, the Mallam," said Grantley,
gravely.
''By Jove!" Jeremy murmured.
"I think you ought to forgive her."
Grantley suggested. "He's played twice
for England, you know, and made a
century the. first time."
"I remember." Jeremy acknowledged,
looking very thoughtful.
This was quite a different matter
from the ordinary curate. Ritualistic
proclivities, however obnoxious to Jere
my in their essence^ became a pardon
able eccentricity in a. man whose solid
reputation had been won in other
fields.
It was not surprising that Dora car
ried her head very high, or that the
cool politeness of her bow relegated
Jeremy to a fathomless oblivion. Know-
Ing the ways of girls and reluctantly
conscious of Mr. Mallam's greatness â
conscious, too. perhaps, that his own
riches and fame were not as yet much
in evidence â he was prepared for that.
But, alas. Charley was a cricketer, too.
and had Infected Eva with his enthusi
asm for the game. She was quite ex
cited about Mallam. Jeremy did not
appreciate this feeling as generously as
he might have; yet Eva made no at
tempt to % conceal it. She rather em
phasized'it; for she had. come to the
stage when she sought defenses. Af
ter the first eager spring to meet the
offered and congenial love there comes
often this recoil. The girl would have
things stay as they are, since they are
very pleasant, and the next step is
into the unknown. She loves delay,
then, and, since the man will not have
it for its owai sake (not knowing its
sweetness nor the fear that aids its
charm) she enforces it on him by
trickery and makes him afraid of los
ing the draught altogether by Insist
ing on. his sipping it at first. She will
use any weapon in this campaign, and
an ardent admiration for Mr. Mallam
was a very useful weapon to Eva Ray
more. She said more than once that
she considered Dora Hutting a very
lucky girl. She thought Dora must be
charming, since Mallam, was in love
with her. She held Mallam to be very
handsome and refused to believe â well,
that his. talent was so highly special
ized as Jeremy tried to persuade her in
words somewhat less gentle than these.
Jeremy's knowledge of girls gave out
before this unexpected call upon It. He
recollected how Dora had served him.
and how Anna Selford had trifled with.
Alec Turner. He- grew apprehensive
and troubled â also more a'nd more. In
love. He forecast . complicated tragre
dies, and saw Mallam darkening his
,life wherever he turned." -But the Wo
men understoodâ Kate Raymore. Chris
tine, even Sibylla. They glanced at one
another and laughed among 'them
selves. They were rather proud of
Eva, who plaved their sex's game so
well.
"Thank goodness she's learned to
flirt!" said Christine. "A woman is no
where without that, my dear, and I
don't care whether she's married or
not."
"She just adores Jeremy," Kate as
sured Sibylla. "Only men can't see,
you know."
Sibylla laughed. She understood now
â better than in the day3 when she her
self was wooed: But she blushed a lit
tle, too, which was strange, unless, per
chance, she found some parallel to
Eva's conduct which she was not in
clined to discuss with her friends. Jer
emy was not the only man who went
courting just now in Milldean. Nor was
Kate Raymore the only woman- whose
heart expected a wanderer home, and
trembled at the Joy of a long-desired
meeting. The period or Mrs. Mumple's
expectation was almost done. . In two
or three weeks she was to go on a jour- â 
ney; she would come back to Old Mill
House not alone: The nouse was swept
and garnished, and Mrs. Mumple had a
new silk gown. The latter she showed
to Kate â and a new bonnet, too, which
was a trifle gayer than her ordinary
wear; it had a touch of youth about It.
Mrs. Mumple knew very well who was
the best person to show these treasures
to, who the best listener to her specu
lations as to the manner of that meet
ins. And she. â  in turn, was eager to
listen to Kate when the news came
that .Charley's ship was to-be In quite
soon. Kate could. not say much about
that to anybody except to Mrs. Mum
ple; but she was sure that Mrs. Mum
ple would understand.
When on the top of all this came the
announcement that Dora Hutting's
wedding was fixed for that day three
weeks. Christine Fanshaw was moved
to protest. - - .
"Really, Grantley," ahe exclaimed,
"this village is a center of love-mak
ing, of one sort or another!"
"All villages are," said Grantley.
suavely tolerant, "or they couldn't go
on being villages. It's life or death to
them, Christine." â¢
"That's a contemptible evasion. The
atmosphere is horribly sentimental. I
don't think I'm in sympathy with it at
all."
"Don't talk to me, then," said Grant
ley.' "I like it, i you know. Oh. you
needn't fret, my dear friend! There's
been lots of troubleâ and there'll be lots
more." 9"94
"Yes, trouble â and- hatred, too?"
"Oh, well, suppose we suppose there
.won't be that?" he suggested. "But
the trouble, anyhow." . '. . \o
"Then everybody oughtn't to pretend
that there won't! The way people talk
about marriages is simply hypocrisy."
"When the bather is on the bank, it's
no moment for remarking that the
water is cold. And the truth Is in our
hearts all the time. Am I likely to for
get it, for instance? Or are. you likely
to forget poor old Tom and that un
happy woman?"
"Or am I likely to forget myself?"
Christine murmured, looking out of
the window. As she looked. Dora
passed by, and broad-shouldered
young Mallam with her. "Oh. bless the
children!" she said, laughing.
"It doesn't do, though, to be too
knowingâ too . much up to, all nature's
little tricks," Grantley went on, as he
came and stood beside her. "We
oughtn't tb give the old lady away. She
seems a bit primitive in her methods
sometimes.^ but. if we don't interfere,
she usually , gets there < In the end.' But
we mustn't -find out all her secrets." -

VL/ among; his subscribers, halted at the
V. house of Old Limuel Jucklin. He had
time to stop only for a few moments,
he said; a delinquent tax list demanded his
attention at home, and as his "patent side" had
not yet been reclaimed from the merciless maw
of the express office, nothing: toward the printing
of his next number could be done until after his
return to town.
And after sitting a long time it seemed as if he
were about to so. He took up his hat and had
made a motion to put it on his head when his atten
tion was seized upon by the rattle of dishes in the
dining-room, Just across the broad passage-way Â«in the
north section of the old log house. It is of no doubt
that the embryo crowing of a half-feathered domi
pecker had appealed to the scribe to break his journey
in the hope of breaking his fast at the hous.- of his
"constant reader," and as he drove into the yard he was
seen to cock his eye at a Plymouth Rock pullet.
But as the hours wore hungrily along he saw no signs
of dinner. In no seeming fear, of danger the chickens
walked about the yard. And from the window, where
a perfumed breeze murmured music amid the tendrils
of a trumpet vine, the editor looked across a corner of
the garden into a lot where in the sunshine sucking pigs
Just big enough if roasted lo hold crab apples in their
mouths, were tumbling over one another.
Xot with an extra effort of memory was it that the
newspaper man recalled the fact that his pre-dayli-ht
breakfast had consisted mainly of sodden cakes and
extreme hurry. It was fresh in his mind as he heard
the "pot rack, pot rack," of a guinea hen. But with
the air of vital concern he talked on* the condition of
the country and of foreign probabilities. He didn't
load down his speculative mind with what had taken
place. That would have been a matter of mere in
dustry. It lay within the keen province of his vision
to discover what might be done if such and such should
happen. If a certain prime minister should resign,
or if the emperor should so far forget himself as to
say so and so in his coming speech, why it was clear
that this, that and the other would happen. And Old
Lim agreed that it was no doubt true.
The sun lost its balance and slipped over into the
afternoon, the waring vine at the. window sifted a
softer light, and still there was no call from pot or
pan. So at last, the editor arose and was about to
put his hat on his head, when there came from
the dining-room the rattle of dishes. Then he hesi
tated, turned about an if he had just thought of a
wise thing to say, and sat down.
"I reckon a cat must have run over the table"
said old Lim. and Shang W. Mowletfs heart beat
low in despair. v
"Sorry, colonel, you didn't come a little
earlier. Reckon you seen some of them
pigs out there. Had one of thr~
V-rothers roasted to a fall of the
year brown, and ." The editor
grabbed out his handkerchief and
wiped his mouth. . Old Lim con- c
tinued: "And I had some early

of theseâ the Albunflnsâ is that

growed outen the ground, and these little brownish redishes that look

some Prentice looked about him with a
sigh of satisfaction. It was good to be

girl .who was handing him a cup of
tea. .
"So here I am at last," he said. "And,

The girl hesitated, playing, with the

All at once she comprehended why
it was that she had hesitated to an

that she had Judged Von Witzleben
from Ransome's . standpoint rather
than her own, appreciated that it had
been the fact of his intimacy * with
Ransome which had been his chief at

IT may not be so hard as at first

It is not true that people cannot over-^

rover such propensities even when
quite young, and -If the effort is then
begun earnestly, the traits supposed to
be inherited can be either entirely erad

be incapable of harm to others.
Ugly dispositions, disagreeable little
ways are often excused under the plea
of "getting it honestly" from cither a
father or mother, which gives a. certain
license to allow full swing to a nasty
manner that causes more than one
heart to ache. The very fact that a

that he or Ehe is indulging the repre

The -mother whose temper makes a
household unhappy should be an object
lesson to her children to avoid such
ebullitions in their own homes later by
cultivating a manner that will bring
happiness and obviate the scenes that
clouded their own childhood. The wo
man whose mother was exacting and
inconsiderate can use her own percep
tions and know that by watching her
own conduct she may correct the faults
that made her childhood so unhappy.
There is nothing like taking life easy,
to cultivate the calm that keeps a
course of plain calling. A guard over
one's temper, for which there often is
neither rhyme nor reason, or if there
be, it is of a nature so trivial as' far
from justifies the outburst.
Excessive emotion of any kind is a
dreadful strain on one's vitality, ex
hausting it in a way that is more diffi
cult -f recuperation than one is prone
to suppose. The reaction of an out
burst of this nature occasions a mental
strain that results in physical collapse

There is the historic case of Miss Cas

around the hotels and cafes of ancient
Troy informing the people that the
country was going Democratic at the
next election. Instead of taking her at
her word and seeing to it
that, the Judges of election were
properly apprised of. their du
ties, they chased the young lady out
of town, passed, resolutions of confi
dence in the administration and let
themselves be skinned in the first horse
trade that came their way.
We all know cases of this kind where
people have gone out of their way to
take a crack at the friends who were
giving them good advice, at the same
time turning over their check' book's to
the green goods man in perfect confi
dence in his intention to do them good.
Almost any member of the fallible hu
man race would do as an , illustration
of this profound truth^ but for purposes
of convenience we shall select one par

exacts a penalty that must be paid.

Galveston. Tex.; but. as Rudyard once
said, that's another item. Just the
same. I look back with pride to my
career as pancake editor.
All days look alike in the busy rou
tine on board a crowded vessel and I
readily fell into the way of going ship
shape. Food, sleep and excitement
soon rounded out â¢ the hollows in my
boyish cheeks, and Mr. Whitney, with
the cares of a large steamboat on his
mind, fared well.
One of the black boys gava me a
shirt and collar; another trimmed my
hair and a passenger, whose heart was
large and his feet medium, tipped me
to -a pair of shoes. The condition of
my old ones was wretched in tha ex

WHAT WOMEN WANT TO KNOW
season of the year when, the -very air
Â»s permeated with the spending spirit
and the windows show 1 . such. tempting
fabrics and such dainty little acces
sories of all sorts and descriptions.
The absolutely essential thing for
the girl who spends much of her time
walking is a durable trotting suit, and,
while It should be serviceable in tex
ture, short in length and of a coldl
that will not show the dust and wear
and tear. It should always be pretty.
In fact, just as smart as it is possible
to get it. Fortunately for all of us,
the rainy day skirt is a thing of the
past, and a very dim and distant past,
at that. But since cloudy weather
togs are as present as ever \ and will
continue to be as long, as the . winds
and clouds conspire against us, it be
hooves every one to do a heap of
thinking and to buy with cloudy
weather in mind.
Thanks to Dame Fashion, who
really is not quite as bad as she is
made out to be, there are an endless
variety of suits provided that may be
worn on rainy days without sacrific
ing one's good looks in the slightest
and without sacrificing one's comfort,
either, but they must be constructed
just so or they do not bear the im
press of style. And the beauty of
these gowns is that they are fashioned
in such a way that they can be worn
for many other occasions. They make
good shopping costumes; they are
splendid for a morning's promenade,
and they are quite good enough for
informal calls. Indeed, it is difficult
to discover a dividing line between
calling and cloudy weather apparel
"and that is the principal reason why
every girl should always have a hand
some two-piece suit" hanging in ; her
closet ready to be donned at a min
ute's notice. â '. " . ."'...-â  . "
Of . course, such a costume '. calls for
a nobby hat, and it goes without?say
ing that it should be of the serviceable
kind. It should not be' too' large" nor
yet too small, for one is not the best
of taste and the other is a difficult
problem to keep from getting awry.
There is an English make of hat that
is just the very thing, for it' manages
to look well whether it "'â  is tilted ' or
straight and even, in the eagerness of
a shopping tour it always looks digni
fied and remarkably. fit.
Almost any sort of a plain waist,
whether it be of cotton, linen or silk,
is in good taste and nearly always
pretty, for there is such an abundance
of material and such a quantity -of
colors that one may close one's eyes
and grab blindly .and get something
tremendously, smart. The ; trimming
comes in with the neckwear and the
belts, for they form such an "essential
part In the costume these days â¢â¢' that
under no circumstances should they
be left out. Belts, - let me say right
here, are divided into a number of
classes. And "when one says a belt,
nine times out of ten a belt" is the, laat
thins on earth that . is : meant. ' More
often than not it is a girdle t or â  stom
acher, or even a very, wide back -and a
narrow front. In fact, a belt Is i no
longer a' belt, but' anything . that
, chances > to come from the nimble : fin
gers of the ingenious.
Here is a belt that dresses up a plain
waist to such an "extent that : it" scarce
ly knows itself:
Begin by buying. three yards of satin
ribbon five 'inches wide.' Pin! one -end
of the ribbon securely., to, the I front \ of
your belt to keep^it'from slipping. Now
begin â  and ,wlnd '- the â¢ ribbon * ; tightly
about your, waist, ' gradually I increasing
the width of I the *: girdle^ â  Finally I pin
the Ioose'erid tightly Jand Invisibly and
you I will * have ,' as * fashionable - and as

COLD WATER AND
HEALTH
â¢V NE of the most interesting de
| TV velopments in modern medical
\^ science is the certain proof of
the ; Immense importance of
cold water to health, both as a rem
edy for and a prevention of disease.
But cold water should not be con
founded with ice water; that is almost
as"' disastrous to stomach, heart and
liver as'a liquor or drug habit. Cold
water means the temperature of
spring water of an October morning.
just a crisp freshness about it, but no
shock. .For drinking purposes water
should be cooled in an icebox, Just
bottled or canned, but never with ice
in it, which is unhygienic as well as
unesthetlc.
Physicians declare that very few
Americans drink enough water, that
the bad digestion, bad complexion and
bad nerves of our city arid town people
are! largely due to the result of not
drinking enough cold water.
The 'system : demands its full allow
ance of clear, 1 cool, natural fluid in or
der" to do its work properly, and
breakfast, coffee,' luncheon " chocolate
and 'dinner - cocktails are not only a
bad', substitute, but worse than none.
..When the body is thirsty It is call
ing for water; at least half a plnt^ be
fore ; breakfast, another before going
to bed and .three half pints during the
day, preferably not at meals.
It is an excellent; plan every morn
ing and night before' drinking water to
rinse -the iriouth ;, with a . solution of
warm water and borax. Just a pinch
of powder in half a tumbler of water.
It gives ; the water a deliciously fresh
taste, besides sweetening the mouth,
hardening the gum's arid cleansing' the
teeth:N " ,
A' course of this cold water treat
merit Is^ worth trying if just for* the
sake of a hearty appetite and rosy
cheeks.
To get the best value of your effort
you should "accompany the cold, water
drinking with a daily morning cold
bath.- 7
The bath should, be taken before the
drink, so * that there is not the * faint
est chance of arrestirig even the simple
process of ; digesting 'A 'cold
bath is '. only a ' success"* with * an - empty
stomach. (jJoHH â â 
to address an envelope and stamp It so
that your manuscript may be re
turned to you if it is not available,
for then you will learn your fate in
a short time. At the end of your story
put your name and address and do
be careful to have it plain, for the
editor is too busy to worry over you
and your woes. Yes, you can
duplicate a story if you wish,
but In that event be sure to mark
it for a certain date and write "re
leased Jan. 4." Then the editor will
understand it Is not exclusive and that
it is not to be used until on or after
that date. Of course such a story never
brings as much as an exclusive one,
though if you are fortunate enough to
sell it to four or five newspapers it will
mean more in the long run. Books are
not handled in the same way. I will
tell you more about them If you wish
to know, but I imagined you wanted
to know about short stories.
JANET (Christmas Gift).â Pretty
slippers are always nice and appro
priate, too, but I do not believe I would
get them too elaborate. Get a pretty
slipper and trim it up to suit yourself.
For instance, get some narrow black
velvet ribbon and put it on like so
many strata, and gather the three or
four pieces into a bunch and finish it
with a large rosette that fastens snug
ly over the instep.
X. Y. Z. (Red Eyes).â Here are two
recipes that are good for granulated
eyes: Yellow oxide of mercury, one
grain; rose water ointment, one-half
ounce; apply to eyelids morning and
night. A good wash for inflamed eyes
is as follows: Borax, two grains; cam
phor water (not spirits of camphor),
two ounces. Drop a little of the solu
tion into the eyes two or three times a
day and bathe the lids with the mix
ture.
While the water is running in the tub
prepare for the slight shock of the first
plunge by taking long breaths at an
open window. "Wrapped in a wool bath
gown, there will be no danger of catch
ing cold, and two or three minutes
long, slow inhaling and exhaling fresh
air will start the circulation so that
there is no hesitation about a cold wa
ter bath, rather a sense of enjoyment
of It. But if at the very start you
should still be at all sensitive to the
straight cold plunge, stand at the edge
of the tub, lean over and dash cold
water over the face, arms, neck, chest
and throat. Drv thoroughly with a
crash towel and plunge in first one leg
and then the other.
After a week of this sort of tempor
izing you will be able to take the
straight plunge. That is of course if
the room is warm. A cold bath in a
cold room may be fine heroism for
athletic boys, but it is more than likely
to prove dangerous to the average
woman who has not much power of re
action.
The daily tepid bath usually taken by
women in winter may be luxurious and
cleansing, but it is no substitute for
the health giving power of the cold
water. It is the sting of the cold that
starts the blood coursing through lungs
and ' heart, that warms the hands and
feet and sends a fine color to the
cheeks. A cold bath should . be taken
quickly, always" followed by a crash
toweJ rub and always in soft water.
Much of the value of the cold bath is
lost If the water is hard, the pores are
clogged rather than opened, ft Is im
possible to dry the skin quickly, and it
is left with a clammy sensation that is
depressing. It also makes sensitive
skln'rdugh, and so coarsens it.
Where rain4vater can be had nothing
is better. It is an emollient as well as
a stimulant to the cuticle, but in town
and city the water supply is artificial
and it is the exception to find it soft.
Fortunately hard water is not an ir
revocable misfortune. The worst min
eral water can be softened with pure
borax. Two tablespoonfuls of pure
borax will soften a tub of water to
the â  mellowness of rain water. And In
addition to its beneficial effects in the
water it has medicinal properties that
actually,, stimulate the action of the
skin and whiten it. '

Certainly, no one could .' accuse C. S.
Benedict, a prominent business iman,
of neglect, yet the' news of his accident"
was telegraphed the length and breadth "
of the land and his life was "almost de
spaired of. '''-'-*â ,â  '-'.
In case of such an accident, whatv
â would vou do?
. Nine and ninety times you would lose
your head and fly aimlessly about, add
ing to the, general pandemonium that
usually reigns supreme at euch a time.
The other time you might possibly act
as promptly and as effectively as
<lid his Eon, Mr. Egbert Bene
dict, when he was confronted with
the . horrible fact that both father
* and mother were unconscious and
had been in that state nobody
knew how long. He flew about all
[ right, but It was to throw open the win
dows and to promptly begin a system
of rigorous movements that: sent â  the
gas reeling: and gasping from their
bodies as fast as It could go.
"How did you know what to do?"
everybody has asked him a thousand
ar.d one times since the accident, and
lor answer he has merely pulled a small
card from his pocket and given them a
fleeting glance at a "Quick Heir* in
Poisoning or Accidents'* that he has
been fpiardicg as the apple of his eye
ever since.
Probably any amount of those self
tame little cards ' have been passed
about town during the past years, but
you couldn't buy one for love nor
money Just now, and all because it
showed its true worth so strongly in
this particular case.
When the younger Mr. Benedict was,
called by the Chinese boy and told that
something must be wrong with the
"Boss," and that the house was filled
with a strong odor of gas, It didn't
take him very long to reach his fath
er's doer and to throw his six feet of
solid manhood against it in a decided
manner. The fierce outpour of the
sweet, sickly fluid and the sight of the
Ftill forms made him hesitate a moment
a'nd then he was in the thick of the
fray battling with the deadly gas for
all that the world held dear to him.
"There wasn't much I could do." he
has told his friends since. then. 'Taut I
have this little card to thank for their
lives. In the first place I opened the
windows and then commenced a regu
lar rough and tumble treatment that
wculd get them Into motion and give
. them some chance of getting pure air
ir.to their lungs. My instructions told
me plainly to raise and lower the arms
regularly and to force the gas out by
an even pressure on the chest. I tried
the latter first and found I could force
it out quicker by slipping my hand
under the shoulders, raising the body
until the head fell back with its own
weight and then deliberately pressing
in the chest with a spasmodic motion
that was more like a quick jerk than
anything else I can think of.
. "In doing this all the breath was com
pelled out and as soon as my hand re
laxed its pressure the fresh air rushed
in to take the place of the foul. Time
" after time I tried this and then I be
gan to raise the arms over the head
and in lowering them pressed the el
bows into the sides so that the side
walls of the lungs would be forced to
do their part. This I did at the rate
of about eighteen or twenty times a
minute, and very systematically, for
I didn't want to tear them to pieces.
"It suddenly occurred to me that per
haps my. hands could press out any
etray whiffs that might have tucked
themselves away in the bottom of the
lungs, so I placed my hands between
the waist and armpit and literally
shook and pressed alternately until the
breath came in short gasps and showed
me that I still had something to work
for. And that ie really all I did, for
about that time the doctors came with
oxygen and every other remedy known
to medical science."
Really all he did do was to save the
lives of both his father and mother.
All the doctors have said so-; all the
nurses have suid bo, and, In fact, all
concerned concede as much to him, yet
he tells his simple little story and says
he owes It to good luck and his four by
six advertising card.
If one always knew just bow this
poisonous illuminating liquid would act
there might be a remedy always near
in case cf an emergency, but unfortu
nately it is as variable as the winds

which evidently had blown out while
she dreamed, and to all outward ap
pearances she was sleeping- too sound
ly to be roused.
. For almost two years she lay In that
peculiar unconscious condition, while
the medical world pondered' and sug
gested every remedy that was half way
â justifiable. Her case was discussed In
scientific Journals and on all possible
occasions, but the deadly poison had
permeated her being too thoroughly and
too completely to respond to any treat
ment, and at the end of two lonjr years
this* sleeping: Galatea slipped mercifully
away into the great unknown.
Since that time all sorts and condi
tions of restoratives have been-used for
the relief of gas asphyxiation, but 'with
varying success, as all seems to depend
upon" the Individual cases. The .Tery
day" of the Benedict catastrophe a
sailor on the water, front .was hurried
off . to "'Â» the Emergency Hospital and
a new theory that a French surgeon
hasbeeri advocating was "put, into prac
tice in this" city for the first Unse. Hy
drogen peroxide was injected into the
stomach with a tube' and as soon as
the;, remedy was absorbed by the
stomach "and the oxygen began to
circulate freely through the blood
he sat up -and denied in a most stren
uous' fashion that he had ever tried to
kill himself or -that he had ever enter
tained 'such a thought for a single mo
ment. His" recovery was very complete
and almost instantaneous, so much so.
in fact, that those who witnessed the
miracle drew Â«^ long .breath of relief
and felt that .the*perplexingr gas prob
lem had been solved at last.
Yet when Mr. and Mrs. Benedict were
lying at death's door, this antidote was
not resorted to,*- nor yet was. oxygen,
used, though It stood by the bed ready
to be tapped at a moment's notice.
Medicines were not their salvation nor
do they owe their lives to artificial
means. Plain, ordinary gymnastic
movements were kept up until the
breath of life returned to them and
th'ey were In a fair way to. recover. Of
course, no one could rally from such
a shock and not feel any depressing
results, but. at least, all their energies
were bent on recovering from minor
troubles, such as bruises and black and
blue spots inflicted by their , energetic
son. rather than from the after effects
of powerful medicines.
No one, even in the seclusion of
one's own home, can ever feel abso
lutely secure from this deadly demon
who stretches out his greedy arms and
claims the rich and poor alike. Nor
can one tell when its messenger will
slink through the nooks and crannies
and leave death in its wake.
A lew years back it was content with
merely poisoning its victims and gen
erally stealing in on them in the mid
dle of the night, but now it is no
strange thine: to hear of explosions, and
such mighty ones that brick and mor
tar cannot withstand its force.
The F. TV. Bradley Incident was a
fair example of that. The odor was not
strong enough to prevent him from
walking down â  his . front stairs with a
lighted cigar in his hand, but the gas
was powerful enough. and had collected
to such an' extent*. that he 'was blown
across the street and picked' up nearly
dead.. While it was not a direct, case
of, asphyxiation,, the "~injui..waV.ln. an
unconscious condition for hours and the
gas that he had inhaled into his. lungs
had ;much , to % do with* his precarious
condition. -X . . '.'â '.'- . - ..-
If one'knew just when or where it
would strike,, or,, Just what remedies
would prove to be the most beneficial,
there \ .would not be such . universal
need of care or precaution, but it never
falls- to come like a thunderbolt from
a clear sky. And especially so since a
small quantity is quite as pungent and
as penetrating enough to fill a good
sized room. .
.So the only thing to do and the only
way to feel safe is to fortify one's self
against the evil hour. It may. be '.all'
very well enough and good to bleed pa
tients and supply the loss of blood by
a saline solution, and it may act like
a charm to use peroxide, but while
the household is running hither and
thithe r after a doctor, valuable time
is being lost and it is no uncommon oc
currence for the patient to die before
the professional man arrives. And' even
if he does come in the nick of time the
medicine may not counteract â  the gas
as it should, and the victim is indeed
a victim, hot through negligence of any
kind, but through ignorance and & sort
of a general misunderstanding all the
way round.
Even. If one did know what to do and
had the strength to do it promptly and
well, the medicine chest may.be dis
tressingly empty, and nine times out of
ten it is in the case of an emergency,
but the knowledge that one carries in
one's head or in one's vest "pocket is
always ready and always available,
and if it Is as effective as it was with
the Benedicts it will certainly prove to
be a veritable godsend to more than
one household. At any rate, 'it is such

I Do you?A
Good
Samaritan
(There being no names to publish this
week the Puzzle Editor gives you
a quaint little story submitted for
the Children's Christmas page by a
Portland writer.)
ONE afternoon Janet and her
Aunt Earn went downtown to
see Santa Claus, who was visit
ing for a few days before Christ-
mas at one of the big depart
ment stores, and after shaking hands
with the jolly old fellow and seeing
his snow covered sleigh and reindoor,
Janet and Aunt Emma walked
through the doll department, where
Janet fairly held her breath in won
der and admiration, for no matter
where she looked she saw the most
beautiful dolls looking down at her
and smiling in a happy way until she
â wondered which of them Santa Claus
would put into her stocking.
While she was admiring them and
trying to decide which she liked the
very best, the brown haired dolls or
those with yellow curls, her aunt told
her they would now go over to the
hospital department and visit the lit
tle sick dolls. And sure enough,
ttiere on a counter Janet saw a great
many sick and wounded dolls of all
llnils piled in a cruel heap under
neath a sign bearing in black letters.
"Tour choice for 5c"
Janet's little heart at once went out
to the poor little creatures and whis
pering cautiously to her aunt so as
not to disturb the little invalids she
asked If she might take one of them
home and put it to bed in her little
white doll bed, for she was sure she
could nurse it back to health again.
Â»o Aunt Emma and she looked them
over and what a sad sight to see one
poor doll with both china feet broken
off and one with its nose broken and
one arm gone. Surely it must havÂ«
been a terrible train wreck to have
hurt bo many dolls so badly.
Aunt Emma picked up one who had a
dreadful rip in her aide, and whenever
She was moved the least bit the saw
dust came pouring out. She was a
pretty little eirl doll, with brown curls
and brown eyes, and the reddest of lips
and cheeks. Aunt Emma said she was
named Jennie and that she thought
Jennie would recover with proper
treatment. ';
Then there was anofher poor doll
with blue eyes and yellow hair and the
sweetest of chubby, pink faces. Her
name was Susie and Janet liked her
very much. She felt badly when she
saw that Susie's arm was almost
off and Just hanging by a thread. Aunt
Emma thought they could also cure
Susie.
Janet next discovered a poor little
colored doll named Toppy, whose kinky
hair was almost off and fell back re
vealing a bald little head. Janet was
worried for fear Topsy was too sick to
ever get well again and pulled her own
hair Just once and decided it must
have hurt poor Topsy dreadfully ; to
have had hers pulled so hard.'
Aunt Emma had the three sick dolls
carefully wraased In* medicated paper,
so as pot to run any risk of their get
ting worse, and Janet carried them
home and began at once to relieve their
suffarlnjr. "<'*..'â ..:.-.;Â«..
She aroused Mary: Jane from the:lit
tle bed in which she. was sleeping and
sat her In a corner, scolding her -'for
being such a sleepy-head,\ and*' then
went at her task of getting the ; little
befis In . readiness . to. receive the little
'patients Just as soon as the operation*
â¢were over, for Aunt Emma said they
would all -have to undergo an opera
tion.
After she had the three little beds In
a row. with the covers turned back.
Aunt Emma called her to. help in, the
operation on Susie, who would have to
take chloroform so that It would. not
hurt so badly. So Janet held a piece
of cotton under Susie's nose while 'Aunt
Emma carefully sewed Susie's "'' arm
back securely to her body so neatly
tnat Janet could scarcely find the
Etitches, and Susie was put to bed to
recover from the effects of the chloro
form, t j
Next came Jennie and after Aunt
Emma was sure that Jennie was sound
asleep, she took an instrument,. that
looked like a needle, only longer, and
sewed a piece of chamois skin carefully
over the wound in the doll's side.' Janet
then tied a bandase over the wound
and tucked Jennie snugly. in her. little
bed. . . . â  â¢ ' â ''â '.

"Oh, the cats!
Well, there's Motri., m , vmr . mtim
wenna, she's a black lady of no partic
ular value, Just a piece of ordinary
English black velvet, guaranteed never
to go off color, and warranted to wear
well. Then there's a blue Persian,
whom we call Arbuthnot Woods. He
is a person of value, and a gentleman
of fortune, possessing real property in
the shape of silver cups, medals and
collars. But the pride and darling of
my heart is Maudie Marguerite."
"MaudJe Marguerite Is a cat?" said
the men.
Tes. I suppose an unfeeling person
would call her a cat."
"Oh," cried another voice. Just be
yond the ring of light cast by the fire.
"EfBe believes in a rather queer creed
â¢where her animals are concerned. She
believes they all have souls."
"And eo do you," .rejoined EfBe.
"And eo I do. I love my animals;
they are always the same, they never
turn on one, they are never spiteful. If
they do by chance happen to scratch
or bite, they neve^ mean it."
"And Maudie Marguerite is a Per
sian?"
"Tee, a Persian.".
"Blue?"
"No, not blue. She is a golden tabby
with amber eyes," Eflle Harkaway re
plied. -
The voice from the big chair beyond
the ring of light ' broke In again.
"MautJie Marguerite is a very nice Per
sian tabby, what is i ordinarily known
among tshow people as' a French long
haired cat."
"Nothing of the kind," rejoined Effie.
"She's a rich golden-brown color, heav
ily marked with black, with eyes of
amber. French tabbies, as a rule, have
eyes like green jade, and Maudie.Mar- ;
guerite has none of the usual marks
of a French tabby."*.
"As how?*
"Well, a French long-haired tabby
usually has very long : limbs, and : a
larger head than you find in the major
ity of Persians, and they, are gray and
black, without .any; tawny tints. ;This
little cat is squarely made, thick In. her

have tufts of black fur between :. the

at 'her.tmeaning. that. Effle,. the pet and

teased, on * subject which lay so near
, her heart.
-It was Geraldlne who sketched out
half a dozen descriptions of the Alto
gether. Adorable, using a big brush and
making a very effective placard; it was
Guraldlne who helped Effle in her in
.quiripe, and in going round the shops
whjch were nearest to Queen's House
crescent; and it was Geraldine who.
when the, pilgrimage from one end of
Queen's House-crescent. to the othar
wos completed, suggested that she
should go across and make inquiries at
No; 16. â¢ ' â¢ .
'. "No, not No. lB-^not for the world,",
said Effle. '
;"But I should only speak to the parlor
maid, and I have seen her several times
before." > '
'"No. not No. 16. I have a feeling
against it." ifs$&9p9BÂ©Sfel!
"Oh, if you have a feeling 1 against it.
that "is another matter.". -;
â¢.:â ;. Arid -so the sisters ;went into the
house again, and at lunch, as' had been
the cast at breakfast", time, the. lost
Maudie Marguerite was 'the one topic
of conversation. _.'
It was Christmas morning, Christmas
â  in dirty London. Ths "church bells were
ringing through the snow, which was
trying very hard to" make the world re
splendent, and to cover up the dirt
and; misery of a London winter. The
tr^cs !n the moon-shaped ihclosure
which gave Queen's House T crescent Its
name were white and .dainty, but the
roads and pavements were in an inde
scribable state of squalid-looking, half
frozen mud. Christmas, day ; was qjilte
spoilt for the Harkaways. The; great
pile of letters and parcels .which arrived
about 11 o'clock wÂ«re ' as v Dead ' Sea
fruit, because Effle was. so unhappy at
the absence of the Altogether Adorable.;
"Come, we may as well enjoy our*
presents," said Winifred.
"Oh, yes," chimed in Geraldine;
"come. Effle, there's a present for. you .
from Bobby. Myers."
"Yes, I. see there's something from
. Bobby Myers. I will open "Hi oh, yes,
.1 .will "open it. "I wonder If *I: were to
put a- bill in the windowâ what do you
think?"
. "Oh, my dear, there! will be nobody
passing."
"I have a feeling that if I were to put
a bill in the windowâ Gerrie, write me
a bHl." , .; . , . â â¢;
So Geraldine left her parcels and
quickly fashioned a bill setting forth a
brief description of the lost adorable,
one.
"I shall put it in the dining-room
window,"'. said EfflÂ«, "and then every
one who passes will read it. Half the.
shops are shut to-day."
.."Of course," they are all shut, and
only some of them will keep their win
dows open."
Away went Effle, carrying the- sheet
of paper in her hand. "Poor Effle, , I
do wl?h Maudie Marguerite would turn
up, or. Â»!yen if she's ..dead, that,, we
knew," said' Geraldine pitifully, as, the
door, closed 'behind her, younger sister.
."She i wlir turn up," said Winifred.'
"Mark my words; she will turn up. But,
all .the /same,' even: if she. doÂ«sj- two
â  nights out : In this , horrible weather are
enough U-. to :: 'finish oft a little delicate
creature like i that." '< â 
Then Effle; came "in again, and, with
.the, feeling of ; having taken one more
step toward \ the recovery of , Maudle
Marguerite.' began to .open her letters
with < more | zest than :she had â¢â  shown so
far. .'They had not finished their.pleas
ant, task before a great peal came at
' the front door.\ ' "-/ , '.
"That's Major Bruce,". said Winifred.

He lqoked from: one to, the other of the
Uhree sisters, not- ; knowing, whom .to
pointedly address. Effle rushed forward
and > seized . Maudie Marguerite in her
arms. .
- "Oh; my. little duck, my darling! Oh.
where did' you find, her? We know who
=- you 'a re; but we don't know your name.

. "Yes," teaid ; the young man. â  laughing:
a little. ,"I ido; live at No. . 16, and my

in the sunle breath. "Geoffrey Car

."The: same, ladles, at ypur. service.
. You ' see. I am ' beforehand with ; . you/. I
, know your name. .- 1 . have not been in
England lonp. and I have been abroad
for so long that I scarcely know.a soul
in London. I am very bold, very, im-
pertinent, but may I say 2 am very
glad this little pet of yours was lost,
because It has been the means, If you
will allow it so. of introducine us."
"Oh, yes, of course," cried Geraldide,
â who was an artist before everything
else-^'of course, we are only too de
lighted to make your acquaintance.
Sure 1 - Maudie Marguerite's . introduc
tion Is good enough for anybody."
"Do you call her Maudie Margue
rite?" Goeffrey Carthew inquired.
"Yes. that is her name, but we almost
always call her the Altogether Ador
able."
**And she belongs to you?"
"No, to my sister here. She !s pet
to all of us, but she belongs to Effle."
"And do tell me," said Effle, finding
her voice at lastâ "do tell me, how did
you find her?"
"Well, it was like this. I. was coming
home the night before last, quite late,
when I ran against this little creature
in the station entrance."
"The s cation entrance?**
"I saw it was a kitten of value â I
know something about catsâ and it was
much too cold and wet and slushy to
be dawdling about trying to find its
owner, so I carried it home."""
"Was she wet?" said Effle, in an
anxious voice.
!v "Wet! She was thÂ» most miserable
little specimen of a kitten I ever saw
in my life. Her legs were like sticks,
she was wet through, and her com
plainings were pitiful to hear." '
"What did you do with her?" Effie
cried.
"Well. I handed her over to my
housekeeper. She, I believe, practically
washed her and dried her in a blan
ket-'.*
"Did she really?"
"Something of that kind. She was
stuffed with hot milk, and I really be
lieve she had a little brandy and water,
but certainly before I went to bed she
was dry and warm ana perfectly com
fortable. I see," he said, abruptly
changing the subject, and making a
gesture toward the easel nearest > to
him, ; "you have an artist here."
i "That is my sister," said Winifred,
indicating Geraldlne.
- . '.'I*- .must congratulate you. on. the
strength of your workâ this is an ex
cellent bit of draw
ing."
He lingered for
some time over
Geraldlne's can
vases, and then
Major Bruce camÂ©
in with Roy Hark
away, and the story
of Maudie Mar
guerite's . recovery
was told over again.
Roy's thanks were
added to those ' of
his sisters. "We
are awful fools
about animals
here." he said, as
he grasped Geoffrey
Carthew's hand.
"By Jove! â  If you
want to make new
friends, you could
not have a better
way of introducing
yourself." v fEgj|g
"I do want to
make new friends,**
said Geoffrey, look
ing straight into
thÂ»* eyes of the
other. "I have been
out of England for
ten years. I don't
know half a dozen
men at my club:
hardly a soul in,
London and know of the family life
nothing at all."
"Then where are you going to spend
to-day?" said Effle.
"Oh. my servants want to be off on
their, own account, so I shall go to my
club." . .
"The brother -and sisters looked- at
each other, and then Winifred said.
with ; a pretty, elder sisterly air, "Mr.
Carthcw â er, would you mind â I don't
quite know â would you careâ won't you
come and dine with us? We are hav
ing . a kind of free-and-easy day. Ma
jor Bruce has come now. We are go

servants that we should look after our
selves to-morrow. Do stop â take, us

"I "should love to."
â¢ â¢ â¢
A year had gone by. again it was
Christmas day. Winifred Harkaway
sat -at the very late breakfast table
reading her letters.
"Here's another for you, Roy," she
said, throwing the missive â  over to
wher* her. brother was sitting.
."Oh, It's from Gilbert," and he put
,the letter down beside him and went' on
reading the closely written sheet in his
- band.'ssJKnHqp â¢* -â¢'â 
/'"Have you had a letter from Gerrle
this ."morning?" he asked.
. "Ob, yes. She is worrying a little at
our'being left alone together, you and
I, Roy." :
"Well, It's scarcely alone."
"Not alone at all." said Winifred-- "I
must write and tell Gertie how the
lunch goes off at No. 16, and how the
dinner goes off here to-night. Only
think, a year ago to-day therÂ» were
four of us, now Gerrie Is Mrs. Brrfce,

spite of her determination not to give
the man at No. 16 the smallest encour

'What a funny world it is!"
"There's just one thing:." said Roy.
"If you want to get married. Win. you
had better set up your matrimonial

"And If you." said Winifred, blushing

"Hullo!" said Roy, "there's* Eme com
ing across the road with Maudie Mar
guerite under her arm."A CHRISTMAS
TREE
a a Y T is fifteen years since we met.
I dear," observed the matron.
jl "Fifteen long years," assent
ed the spinster, sighing.
"When I was here last," purused
Mrs. Trail, glancing round the com
fortable room, "your mother was alive
and your brother Frank had just in
herited the property. And you, Ellen?"
"I have lived here alone ever since."
eaid Miss Manners, with another sigh.
Then she waved her slim hand to
ward the window, through which
could be seen ihe glimmer of a
cnowy country. "TJiat is my world,
Gertrude. 1 After the death of Frank
and my mother, ten years ago. I
never left the neighborhood. My last
Journey was to Edinburgh when I was
called suddenly to Frank's deathbed.
But he passed away before I arrived,
poor boy."
"I remember," nodded the visitor
sympathetically. "You wrote and tolc\
me. Then Mrs. Manners died a yeai
later, leaving you alone."
Miss Manners nodded in her turn.
"I am always alone," she said pathet
ically, and sighed for the third time.
"I wonder you don't marry," ob
served Mrs. Trail abruptly.
Ellen rose as though the remark of
fended her and moved slowly to the
window. 'There is no chance of my
marrying, Gertrude."
"While there is life there is hope,
my dear."
â¢'There may not be the wish," re
torted Ellen, averting her face.
It was close upon 5 o'clock and the
night was darkening over the Arctic
landscape. A ruddy sunset glowed
behind streaks of black cloud and the
snows were tinted wiih crimson. Ei
len Manners could see through the
leafless park trees the brick wall en
circling her domain. Beyond appear
ed the square church tower and the
thatched cottage roofs around it. The
snow had ceased to fall, but the scene
looked desolate, cold and, in the lurid
sunset, most uncanny. With a shiver
the mistress of the hall turned to the
fire and, kneeling on the Persian rug,
warmed her thin hands thoughtfully.
The world would not have called
this woman of 40 beautiful. Her face
was pale and lined with sorrow and
her garments, were of unrelieved
black. She might have been in mourn
ing from her funereal looks, yet Mrs.
Trail knew that the late Mrs. Man
ners and her son had been dead for
ten years. Even the fondest affection
could scarcely prolong mourning for
such a time.
"Dear Ellen, do look more cheerful,"
eald Mrs. Trail, who was a rosy, stout
matron, fond of the good things of this
life, and especially of those appertain
ing to the table. "Remember it is
Christmas in two days, and we must
force ourselves to be happy during
so sacred a period. I always say that
to Mr. Trail when he grumbles about
the bills. Let us be light-hearted, love.
Why not give a party?"
"Xo," raid Miss Manners, hurriedly.
"I gave up entertaining when my dear
mother passed away."
"Still, a treat to the village childfen,
dearâ a Christmas tree "
"Don't, Gertrude!" She lifted her
hand with a gesture of pain. "The last
Christmas tree we had at the hall was
Just before my cousin. Sir Harry, died.
Thenâ oh." she broke off, "shall I ever
forget the horror of that Christmas
eve!"
"Ellen!" cried the astonished Mrs.
Trail, "What do you mean?" â 
"Nothing. What should I mean? Let
us talk of other things. This little girl
you have adopted â tell nae about her."
"There Is little to tell, my dear. Mr.
'Trail and I, having no children of our
own, adopted this child to cheer our
heart*."
"Who is she?"
"So far as I know the daughter of a
man who writes for the newspapers. I
found him out through the rector of
our London parish. A very nice man,
but dreadfully poor. He loved Dor
othy â that's her sweet name, dearâ and
not being able to keep her in comfort
he allowed me to take her away. She
writes once a year to her father, and.
sometimes sees him. She's a pretty
child," ended Mrs. Trail, complacently.
"What about the mother?"
"She has no mother, poor child. Her
father is a widower."
"What is his name?"
"There Is no need to mention it," re-
Jcined the matron, jealously. "We want
the child all to ourselves. She is Dor
cthy Trail. But there! my dear, I have
told you enough. What about your-,
self?"
Miss Manners stared into the burn
ing coals. "I have nothing to tell you,
Gertrude. My life is lonely. and dull.
I am glad you have come to "stay %\ith
me."
"Yet you have this lovely place and
plenty of money. I understood you in
herited the property when your brother
died."
"Yes. But I wish Frank had lived.,
even though we had remained as ooor
es when 1 was at school with you. I
was happy then, Gertrude. I have never
been happy eince."
"Who is the man?" Inquired the
matron, shrewdly.
Ellen flushed, and rose restlessly.
/â¢Why should there be a man?"
"My dear, you were much too pretty
a girl, not to have * attracted the love
of a man. You have loved . and have
been deceived. Hence your dismal life
and pessimistic views."
"You are' a witch, Gertrude." said
Ellen, trying to laugh, but winclnc. ,
"Ah! I thought I was right. Tell me
all about It, dear," and the good. lady
.ppttled hprself for an Interesting.-cos
"But MIfs Manners hesitated. "You
would only be . bored."
"Ellen," said- her school friend re
proachfully, "nothing concerning you
bores . me. Come, dear," she added,
coaxingly.
The other woman returned to kneel
on the rug and meditate. She- was
wondering how muchtor how little she
would tell her friend. Finally she ~ re
solved to be confidential. Gertrude was
a kindhearted little woman, if a trifle
frivolous. She .would be sympathetic
and silent. And after all these -weary
years of lonely thought it was a relief
to tell the sad.story. On the impulse of
the moment Ellen leant her arms on
Mrs. Trail's knees and burst-into tears.
"It all comes back to me." she sobbed,
hiding her face. "In the great hall Sir
Harry had a Christmas tree for the vil-.
lage children. It was then that he a*
cused Will."
"Is that the man's name?" ' , :.:,
"Yes. He is the only. man I ever
loved. We were to have been married
in January, twenty years ago, but on
that Christmas eve â oh!"
"Dear me!" said Mrs. Trail, opening
her eyes wide. "And the other woman?"
"There was no other woman!" cried
Ellen, starting indignantly to her. feet.
"He loved me and I loved him. But
could I marry a thief â a forger â a â "
"Oh, gracious me. how dreadful! Do
tell me all."
Ellen, pacing the room in the fire
light, dashed into, the story, and told
it hurriedly, as though she feared her
strengths would give â  way before she
reached the bitter end. Mrs. Trail lis
tened with all her ears, and did not in
terrupt. ( ,
"You know we were poor after my
father died," eaid Miss Manners. "We
lived In a little Bloomsbury house, and
though my brother Frank was the heir
to the estate Sir Harry would do little
for him. At last he procured him a sit
uation In the city. There Frank, met
Will and they became great friends.
My brother brought Will home with
him â "
"And you fell in love," interposed
Mrs. TraiL
"Yes," cried Ellen, passionately. "I
loved him with all my heart and soul â
with every fiber of my being did I love
him! Will was clever and kind and
had a future. 1 He and Frank were al
ways together. Sir Harry chose to dis-
Uke Will^and said he led Frank wrong.
But it was not true. I am sure it was
not. My mother loved Will also, but
when she heard Sir Harry talk she be
came distant. You know how my moth
er adored Frank."
"He was the apple of her eye," said
Mrs. Trail.
"The idol of her heart," went on Miss
Manners, pacing the room hurriedly.
"She would have died had anything,
happened to him, and therefore she
was afraid lest Will should lead him
astray. I was engaged to Will then,
and mother wanted me to give him up;:
but I refused. I believed in Willâal
waysâtill that night." â 
"The Christmas eve?7
"And even then I should have trusted
him," continued Ellen, without heed
ing. "I should have come to, him and
married him. If he was innocent he
was. treated vilely; if guilty he needed
me more then, than at any time. 1 Oh,
if Christ left 1 us when we sin'
most/what . would ..become of us ?"" ; *
"My dear, don't talk like that," said'
tUrs.. Trail, uneasily. But Ellen^ talked
on rapidly. - .^- , . .-. ??â *;"/
"I should have forgiven Will,*, but i I

and she sprang ; to ; her " feet: with .a be-,

-V "-"But .- it , is falseâ false I" she cried.
"For.;. Will sinned, and "not my dear

â /There 'came .a -.soft .touch ,on â¢ her

brother as she had known him in the
flesh:* â¢ With one. hand pointing to the
door .; and with a" finger on. his pale
lips 'he â  gazed sadly at her. "With an
impulse she .tried to disobey, but could
not.-/ Ellen" moved i toward " the .door.
Before her glided the appearance sur
rounded by a dim radiance which
made the- darkness .visible. Ellen tried
to speak, but was unable. Her tongue
clove to the roof of her mouth and
her limbs almost refusedi to carry her
along. .But a supernatural
seemed to make her alale to follow on.
Through the door, down the^ long
passage, through the many deserted
rooms movejd the phantom, and the
terrified mortal' followed.
,. At. length the ghostly visitor glided
"into a room which had long since been
âºleft to dust find gloom. It had been
* Frank's study. And there the specter
pointed to an old desk, where in life it
had been accustomed to sit. With a si
lent look, imploring and imperative, it
pointed to tbÂ£ upper range of the piz-
eonholes. â¢ Ellen, â  moved again by tnat
mysterious Impulse, Â» approached the
desk; .'She [stretched out her .hand and
touched V'a little door. â¢ It flew open.
Still â¢the'ghos.tly, finger pointed. At the
back of.'u small cavity, disclosed by the
opening of the door, Ellen found a pro
jecting point, 'which she pressed. There
was a "> cracking > sound ; and' a secret
panel flew. open. \" Out tumbled an en
velope. She found, herself â she. knew
jiqt. Howâ standing In the middle of the
Worn; with this in her hand. Then the
figure appeared- to fade *into nothing.
She" was aloneâ alone In that ghastly
room in the darkness and silence.
Ah outburst of carol singing aroused
her from her trance. -On the desk stood
a candle In a tarnished candlestick. Be
side It was a box of matches left lately
by: some careless "housemaid who had
been 'cleaning the room sacred to the
dead. Ellen lighted the .candle and
opened the envelope. Several sheets in
her brother's .handwriting fell out.
With a beating heart she read them
by * that/ dim", light, . and 'when she fin
ished the last sheet the papers fluttered
to the .ground.
"Oh." great heavens, Will is innocent
afteralll'^afe
. And he was, as the confession proved.
Frarik \ had forged the check and had
induced, Will; Ignorant of his friend's
wickedness, to present it at the bank.
For the sake of the mother heart,
which' would have broken had the truth
come ~ to v lizht. Will, her -noble, brjive
lover, had borne the sin and shame of
another. Sobbing with mingled sorrow
and joy, Ellen Manners sank on her
.knees. 'And again rose the verse of the
carol she had heard. But this time it
sounded like the fulfillment of a prom
ise. The , Child-Christ had, indeed,
given her- the gift of peace:
VAngels'in the skies are singing,
f "Peace and good will unto men.'
Hark! the glorious message rinsing,
'Sweeter -now than it was then.
Anguish flies and sorrows cease.
Peace comes with the Prince of Peace."
II.
.On" the day before Christmas Will
Hanbury . was writing in his London
garret.'. It was a bare, bleak room on
the â  top of a Soho house, containing
nothing but a bed. a table, and two
chairs. In one corner was an ill-fur
nished, cupboard, and a small fire
smoldered in the rusty grate. Han
bnry.; was . a man of over 40, tall and
once, no. doubt, had been good-looking.
But 1 sorrow and illness.' and want had
aged him before, his time. '"_, â 
., The man was not .without talents. At
one time he had done fairly well :'as a
writer on the press. Owing to thÂ«
rumor . of his . supposed crime he had
been unable ttrobtain employment in
the city,' and so had taken to journal
ism." For a" time he - prospered, but
bad i luck. followed him, and. he fell ill.
Now he .was rarely out of the hospital,
and "only managed: to keep :the bread in
his mouth t " by , incessant work. ' His
body." being starved,' his brain suffered,
and - the' tales ' and â  articles he â  produced
lacking in originality, .whereby he
made . but a' small income.. But he
.worked [bravely on, , knowing* his inno
cence "and feeling sure that in his own
good" time Gqd. would give him'a happy
issue out of ; all his troubles. â¢ "'â 
'7, On .this." day he was' asking himself
whether the,- time had come.' Before
him *lay , a ', letter, which he : had that
morning, received from "Mrs.*. Trail." She
mentioned "that with she was
stopping, at. Laybourne: Hall, in Essex,
and ~ asked : him ; to come ,* down < that
Christmas' eve; 1 on a visit. With con
siderable: astuteness Mrs. Trail did not
mention '.that ? ' Ellen ~ Mariners was the
mistress' 1 .' of x the x, house . to " which - she
invited Dorothy's, father; thinking that
Hanbury jj would i not come; did he know
the" woman ;he loved was *â  there. ; But
it' was 'probable," as MrsV Trail; thought,
that ; Hanbury. had i forgotten all about
thehall;-; In ; .this she ;was" wrong. Will
remembered ithe scene Tof . his ; disgrac*
only â  too ! well/ although VI twenty ; years
haa passed since he had left it a ruined
man. At the present moment he was
wondering: if he should obey the com
mand, which, so unexpected it was,
seemed to be a call of Providence.
A -Iwre stllng ,-with": thoughts and feel
ings â¢ f olIowed.V"I . will * go," < he decided
at length, and there was a shining light
in his eyes. '1 am sure this. unexpected
message means that the .time of sor
row Is over. *EJlen,--no doubt, means to
take me back to her heart. But dare I
tell her that I am Innocent ?'?iHe smote 1
his hands together in perplexity. "No!
To da so I should have to betray Frank.
He is dead, and dear Mrs. Manners has
passed, away, but Ellen would grier*
bitterly did she know the truth. I have
borne much, and I shall bear in silence
to the end. If Ellen welcomes me I will
spend a happy Christmas, and when" we
part again more kindly feelings will be
left behind. I will go." â¢
And hi did go. Late that afternoon
he walked to Liverpool -street station
dressed in his best clothes, which were
poor . m enough, and carrying a small
valise containing a change of linen. Hs
did not know if Ellen would invite hlcm
to stop at the hall. but. he had enough
money to prc-cure a night's lodging.
As he trudged between the leafless
hedges and over the frozen snow, his
heart grew light and swelled In his
breast with Joy. He would see dear
little Dorothy, whom he loved so well:
ht> would see again the old hall, where
he had spent so many happy hours,
and above all he would gaze again on
that dear face which had haunted his
sleepless pillow through many weary
years. Sad as had been the past, un
certain as was the future, the man's
faith made him happy.
So merrily he trudged along, and once
found himself singing under his breath
a carol of joy and hope. Everywhere
voices seerfted to be hymning the sea
son. On the common, as he walked be
tween the gorse ' and fern, crunching
the hard snow with swift steps, he
heard snatches of scng from belated
peasants homeward bound. Will knew
many of the faces of those who passed:
but what struck him mo3t was the
absence of children. These should cer
tainly be everywhere on Christmas eve^
But he did not see one until he came
within sight of the park crates. Then
a child peered, into, the- wanderer's face
as he came within the circle of light
cast by the lamp over the gate. This
sentinel raised a shout, and out of the
gate. poured acrowd. of children of -all
fijjes â boys, and girls. These took
riotous "possession of hia valise and of
his stout staff. A number threw chains
of .woven evergreens around him. and
gayly 4 waved branches of holly bright
with crimson . berries. . And laughing,
dancing, singing, racing, the happy
band led the* astonished man up the
snowy avenue.between the frozen, leaf
leSs trees, while the lodgekeeper shout
ed a "Godspeed. and Merry Christmas'*
after the playful throng.
."What do you mean? What Is it?"
asked Will, as he was borne within
eight of the great â¢ building,, by. his
laughing captors.
But the children only sang, and
laughed and danced. They pulled Will
up the terrace steps with glee, and
hurried him Into ' the large entrance
hall.- Here Mrs. Trail was waiting with
Dorothy by her .side. The child ran
to btr clasped . in the "arms of Will, and
the lady advanced with a smile. In a
moment all the children had raced
away into the interior of the house
and, were heard laughing and singing
with fresh, youthful voices."
"What does it all mean?" asked Han
bury, releasing Dorothy.
"You will know that soon,"-, said Mrs.
Trail, smiling. , i'Take . Dorothy's hand.
She has supreme command here this
evening." â¢-
"But " Will looked round anx
iously and with a rather pale. face.
Mrs. Trail understood, and laid a
kind hand on his shoulder. V'Walt,"
she said, softly. "Christmas is here,
and your Joy will be great."
"My Joy?" He looked inquiringly at
her, to , see that her eyes were flilod
with tears. . . .
"Come along,- father," cried Dorothy,
preventing further speech/ "there's the
loveliest Christmas tree In the hall

could not bear to enter the room where

"Dolls and cakes and, fairy gifts for
good children," cried -Dorothy in the
superior voice of 10 years old. "There
are no grown-ups, father, so you* must
help me to- give out the presents. I
can't reach some." .
Falling in /with the child's humor,
and wondering- what it all meant. Will
aided her to dispense the gifts. One
child got a doll, another a brave can
non, a third received a ship, and so on,
until the tree - was' stripped as bare as
those in the snowy park. But one gift
remained on the topmost bough, and
Hanhury. lifted" up Dorothy that' she
might pluck thjs last fruit, of the tree/
It proved to be a good-sized envelope
addressed to himself. When he had it
in his ihand the. child, who -was. evi
dently carrying out instructions, de
parted with the rest of the children,
and they scampered cut of the room,
waking the grave echoes of the old
mansion with delighted laughter. Still
wondering and surprised that; he
should obtain such an unexpected,
strange present. Will opened the en
velope. Within was the confession of
Frank Manners.
"What does this mean?" murmured
Will to himself and sat down to master
the contents of the paper.
When he had finished it fell from his
shaking hand. He never expected that
his innocence would be made clear in
this way. "Poor 'Frank!" he thought,
covering : his eyes. "He was sorry,
after all. Perhaps Ellen may know the
truth also. God.be thanked for his
great mercies."
A hand on his shoulder made: him
look up. Before him stood Ellen, not
now arrayed in dark garments. Her
time of mourning for the ruined lives
of herself and her lover was past.
Dressed as she had been on that fatal
Christmas' eve" twenty years ago, she
bent over the broken man, her eyes
shining with love, and shining through
tears that. would fall. In her old-fash
ioned dress she looked quaint, but "Tn
Will's eyes she appeared lovely beyond
words. . He rose silently to his feet and
opened . his arms. Without a word
Ellen threw' herself on his breast, and
years of sorrow were swallowed up In

she spoke.

OX Folsom street, the Christmas
?â  eve was obscurely dull.
From Mrs. Doolan's third
floor rear hall bedroom it was
even wore depressing. Out of Har
vey's window one raw the blank wall
of a new apartment house, gaunt, -win
dowless. unfinished, facing an adjoin
ing street: and in the middle distance
a Jumble of low, ancient rooms about
a brick-paved court in which the spar
rows fluttered over an ash barrel. A
line of gray and white clothes flapped
In the wind across, this court; a lean,
soiled cat searched in the corners. Even
the Doolan boys, this da\, had for
saken the dreary play space behind
thfÂ« lodging house: it was. the back
and inner s!de of things unlovely, yet
an artist would have looked from it
to the city's skyline â the massed, high
buildings o' â¢'down town" a-glitter
with lights?, that bulked to the very
hill-tops against the gold of the Cali
fornia, sunset. Â«
Old Getts of the second floor front
stood at this rear room window, mus
ing, yet not uncheerily. at the lack of
a holiday aspect to things.
"Ah, a pityâ a pity!" he cried, at
length, when his companion had ceased
his recital, "bov, it was unnecessary â
this deceiving of your good mpther!"
"â¢--"Well, argued Harvey, gloomily,
"you see the thing got away from me.
Mother would worn' so if she thought
I wasn't as comfortably fixed as I
would be at home. You know it isn't
eaisy for a fellow to come to the city and
get on in the art school, and make his
living besides. Somehow, the papera
don't want my work â just now. But I
used to write home so hopefully, that
when things did go a bit hard with
me I lust kept onâ I couldn't let the
folks know. Why, it cheered me
niphts when I was lonesome, to write
Janette how fine I was getting on â
pictures In the exhibits, dinners and
the opera, and living in a four- room
suite and, giving studio teas! I must
have laid it on pretty thick, â¢ but It
pleased mother soâ and she's not well.
Now, Mr. Getts, they are going to drop
in on me to-night, by this telegram,
believing every word of itâ Aunt Nell
and Janette, and aâ aâ girl! Dropping
In on m e without even telling me
their train sol might devise some plan
to steer them downtown â coming here,
to this hall bedroom, third floor, rear,
with its one chair and a washstand,
and that spidery wall paper!"
Old Getts nodded. Oia Getts, the
codger of the quaint dress and walk,
of the kÂ£en gray eyes and pink,
shaven face, which had defied the
gas-lit atmosphere . of some office
down on Pine street for thirty years
â old Getts of the second floor, front,
at Mrs. Doolan's. It was a tradition
of Folsom Etreet that old Getts be
longed to the Merchants' Exchange
and to a trio of clubs on' Union
square-, and that he had apartments
In the stately old homestead, now de
cayed to a south-o'-Market lodging
house, since the old days before the
glory departed from Rincon Hill and
Its mansions fell into sodden disre
pute; its fountains and lawns were
choked and scattered with debris; its
streets/ forlorn and dust-swept and
given over to drays roaring and rat
tling to the water front and the iron
foundries. Harvey Bell, to whom
Old-Getts had been a subject for sun
dry satirical sketches as he trudged
in and out of the. Doolan doorway,
now suddenly wondered how he had
come to make a .confidant of him. It
must have been | the art student's
loneliness on this holiday eve, as he
thought of the sunny California
Christmas in his valley home down
the State. Or it may have ; been
some spirit of the season, for now he
saw that the Christmases of sixty
years glowed . mellowly in -Old Getts'
heart and something 'of the cheer of
each had lingered.
"Well, well." the 'old' man ' was say
ing, "of course you' can't" bring them
hereâ such people as yoursâ on
Christmas eve, ajjart from this la
mentable deception you have been
practicing. Oh, youth â its pride and
pain!"
"And they're coming about 8
o'clock â Aunt Nell and the girls. You
don't know what sort of people mine
are,* Mr. Getts â simple and old-fash
ioned, and mother believes in me so!
They're not town people at all."
"Eh?" Not town people? Why,
here's a whole city full of good hearts
and sympathy, waitingâ waitingâ to
ehow itself â I know! And, boy, you
would not let us understand you. even
on Christmas eve. Now, Mrs. Doolan
sent ine in to ask about youâ Mrs.
Doolan, mind you, of the untidy hair,
â wringing her mops of water with her
young ones clinging to her skirts â
Mrs. Doolan of whom all the lodgers
are afraid â said to 'me: 'Mr. Getts,
it's worryin' I am about the poor
young man in the back hall bedroom
â -him wid the pictures he makes â
eo discouraged this blessed season.
It's not for the rent I'm carin*. but be-
cause of my own Jimmy, 'way out in
the mountains and thinkln' will some
be kind to him, an* would you go
to Mr. Bell for me an' speak a word
because of the. day?' " Old Getts
dropped his droll, mimic's voice to
glance merrily at his companion. "So
I came, boy, because of Mrs. Doolan
with her mops and tubs and young
ones, and because you have held off
from. all of us here on Folsom street.','
> "I know," mutter Harvey, "I'm, een
eitive, and the Doolansâ "A ,. > -
"God bless the Doolans! "â¢ cried Old
Getts. "I am to, be the Doolans' Santa
Claus to-night. There's a bit of a tree
for them and little Maggie Thomas, the
"lame girl, and the . Ramseys, down at
Slacovich's bakery," iu our. block. I

people are coming â now.*t ;'
"Yes, I can't keep them 'off. I can't
even invite them out to arestaurantâ
or anything, Iâ Iâ" Harvey broke off,
lost in his effort to imagine Old Getts ;
of the Merchants* Exchange as St. Nick
down at John Slacovich's bakery on
Folsom street. - â  I.' â '-.-.. '~ '."â Â»*:"*â¢
"I have it!" .exclaimed*- Mr.. Getts.
"Receive them tin my rooms. At ' 8, you

sketches from the chair, while Harvey
was gazing at him, astonished -at the
rapid fire of his ideas. â < â ' : v '
"But, hold onâ hold on!" he protected!
and then, seizing his old lounging' jack

door of his bachelor apartments, ; Old

â¢way to the street. -?'- -"â¢â

Was this Old Getts, ; the codger, the
moneybags,; the amusing figure of an
other age of .gentlemen in dress 'and
gallantry?, Harvey was bewildered by
his ingenuity; then he set to arranging
his sketches and ;* hurrying abput " the

So late? The fairy godfather had

But Harvey's heart smote him when
he saw Aunt Nell smiling proudly at
him with her hand upon the large, old
fashloncd locket s sha wore at her throat.
A singular thins, the picture in that
circlet of goldâ a young man with a
laughing face, dressed in some masque
of Yule-tide, a robe of red and white,
and holding a snowy wis as if he had
just taken it. off to catch the camera's
eye. The young people knew of some
memory in Aunt Nell's life; of a lover,
a foolish quarrel one Christmas night, a
partingâ and he had come no more. To
her each Christmas . was an anniver
sary; thirty years had scftened her
sorrow to a sweet remembrance, yet to
night, as always, she was in a reverie.
It may have been some tremulous pain
in all this joy that caused her to un
clasp the locket, while the young peo
ple were about the piano; to kiss It se
cretly In the firelight's glow. ..
Fresh young voices and . â¢ laughter
were raised on Doolan's dark stairway
as Harvey saw them, down to a cab
on Folsom street. The time.to. the train
was brief; he should not go with them
to the station. The carriage dashed off
with the girls calling out holiday
greetings. Then the host stole up
stairs, dreaming of some message that
had come to him from the pressure of
Barbara's fingers; in his bare little
room he watched the glittering lights
of the city and waited for the midnight
bells of Christmas.
It was very late when Mr. Getts re
turned. The last candle had long
burned from the tree at Slacovich's
bakery. Maggie Thomas, the lame girl,
had been carried to her home by Santa
Claus himself. The little Ramseys
slept in the Ramsey tenement, treas
uring the toys that St. Nick had found
for them. The old man climbed the
Doolan stairs. In his room it seemed
some warm, human presence of the
night's -guests lingered; the echoes of
youns laughter filled old Getts* brain
with memories of other days. He laid
off the overcoat that had concealed, his
fantastic coat of red and white cotton,
and sank back in his old chair before
the fire, still the Santa of Slacovich's
party, with sndwy hair and whiskers
below his round, red little cap.
Old Getts was tired from the shout
ing gayety where he had been the gray
est of them all. He was alone, as he
was wont to be. in these silent rooms,
sunk In thought before his fire.
The Christmas belte were ringing;
from a nearby mission church came a
chorus ot glad young voices â a carol
of the nativity It was; some early band
of Joyous wanderers singing the
"Noel." Old Getts wondered why
there should be sadness in his heart
at this rejoicing, as there had been for
thirty years; it brought, as It always
had done, the vision of hlg heart's de
sire. In this weariness of thought "he
slept and from the doze awakened.
She had come out of the flrelit dusk
of his room before, him. She stood with
lips half parted in a question, framed
in the shadows on the wall.
"Harvey, dear," she said, a trifle
breathlessly, "we missed the train â we
drove back for my locket â it must
have fallen here. Why â Santa Claus?
Harvey, are you Joking again? No.
who â who â are you?"
Aunt Nell started in dismay at the
figure rising from the chair.
"I beg your pardon," she faltered,
"this cannot be the Â« wrong room.
Harvey â Mr. Bell â where is he?"
The red and white Santa Claus
bowed, staring at her from under his
shaggy, false brows. He stepped back,
placing a hand upon the table. Her
eyes followed the motion; she came
forward with a little cry of relief.
"Oh, no â these are his rooms! My
locket â I came for this."
He- picked up the thing she was
about to seize; it was as If .the foreign
touch was sacrilege to her. He held
the gold circlet, looking at the mask
er's face. She still advanced a hand*
to receive it, frightened by his intent.
"This you rs â madame?" The voice
was almost a cry of eagerness.
"Yes. Why, who â who â are you?"
The Santa Claus fissure suddenly
caught the white wig from his head
and face; he straightened up, coming:
to her with an exclamation.
"Oh, would you believeâ could you
believe â a wonderful thing? Ellen
King, he has come back to you!"
Aunt. Nell stared at him, more
frightened than before. And then, as
she was stumbling, old Getts caught
her, led her to the couch, was crying
out, caressing her, eager with passion,
with joy with the wonder of It.
"Nellie! It is true â true as that I
loved you then. Yes, you've come to
me, dear heart- Nell â we do not need
to. understand â you have come."
"Yes," she whispered, "I waited â
waitedâ even though I believed that
you were â  dead.'.'
Midnight, and the Christmas bells
were ringing. Below In the street the
horses became impatient. Janette and
Barbara presently stole . up the dark
stairs to see why Aunt Nell did not
return. They came upon Harvey in
the hall, listening outside of a door.
The voices, within were very low. but
Harvey hushed the girls as though to
h*m had been given some wonderful
understanding.
"Where's dear I Aunt Nell?" they
whispered to him.
"I came down to thank him," Har
vey muttered, "and nowâ oh, come
away." â¢
But some one stirred within the
room. Old Getts suddenly flung the
door.wide open. Then he stood by the
couch where" Aunt Nell lay In a peace
that needed ho interpretation. Still
young and fair and kind she appeared,
by some glad transfiguration, and Mr.
Getts was very proud and erect, with
something a-glltter on the white beard
of; Santa Claus, that still hung from
his. neck. He stooped to kiss Aunt
Nell's hand .and then smiled upon
them. ' :*.\Vv-'\
, "Come in, come in," he cried. "Ah,
boy, I came back an, hour ago before
your guests departed and stood out
side the door â alone! Then" I stole
awsry again, listening to all the joy
and laughter you had brought this
Christmas night into my homeâ that
has been empty and lonesome as my
heartâtill now!"THERE was great rejoicing: In
Tribulation Canyon, for the mo
mentous question of Christmas
dinner had been settled to
everybody's satisfaction. For
turkeys were scarce in the canyon
that -winter and so were chickens. In
fact, most of the miners would have
had to compromise on bacon or plug
cut â as canned corned beef was af
fectionately called â if Doc had not
dug up the needful and given a dinner
invitation to the whole camp.
For Doc had the beet diggings in
the camp, also the first water right,
bo he generally had grub In his cabin
when two thirds of the other miners
were living on hope and rarefied at
mosphere. And as Wilson's heart was
as big as his pocketbookâ bigger, in
fact, for he was in debt half the time
â the canyon breathed a sigh of re
lief, for they realized -that their
Christmas dinner was in good hands.
And it was to be a high toned af
fair, too, for when Doc made the
rounds of the camp with his invita
tions his parting injunction to each
miner was to wear his diamonds.
"For if this isn't a swell affair."
said Doc. "it's because the cook for
gets to put water on the beans, so put
on your frills and make the people
from the Flat think we have a first
mortgage on prosperity."
Now. there were only two China
men in Tribulation Canyon, Ah Lee,
who cooked for Doc Wilson's camp,
and Ben Hoy, who did the washing
for the entire community. And busi
ness had been decidedly dull with Ben
Hoy, for most of the miners had
it-ached the one-shirt stage of the
game in tneir progress toward accu
mulating a fortune, and a man with
but one FhJ"rt to his back generally
lets his reputation for cleanliness die
a natural death, while he keeps his
nakedness under cover as long us pos
sible. . â .!â â¢
But there was something doing at
Ben Hoy's Christmas week. . Never
before in the history of the camp had
so many white shirts .flapped on the
line back of the Chinaman's cabin,
and on the evening . of the 23d Ben
Hoy stoatf in his doorway, his eyes
riveted on the moonlit clothesline and
his soul a-flutter with the ravishing
musir of the flapping shirt tails. He
would iron on the 24th. and in the
evening tne miners would come with
the. money for the goods for there
was to be no credit Christmas week.
"You no catchum money you no
catchum washee." That was Ben Hoy's
motto for ' Christmas week and the
Chinaman grinned complacently as he
lighted a candle and started a couple
of Joss sticks stinking. He was happy;
bo happy he thought he could stand a
little of his own native music, so he
got out his Chinese fiddle and played.
And as the notes meandered down the
canyon Sandy Furgeson sat in his
cabin and drank them in. â¢
"It's the -bag-pipes," he said to his
partner â "my conscience, but it's grand
music. So soothin' to a home-sick body
like me. I'll away up the canyon and
seek the piper." * ; .{
"Nonsense," replied his partner, de
rifcively; "it's nothing but Thompson's
cat and a stray Tom scrapping out on
the tailings."
But Sandy only shook his head and
listened. Ben Hoy put a little more
stomach complaint into the high notes
and the, sounds that came floating
down the canyon would have jarred the

By James Seymour'

the typewriter desk viciously. It
bad been an especially 'trying

disagreeable as only the head of

so out of sorts that she did not even
smile upon Jlmmie, the elevator. boy.
When she found Billy Teller waiting at
the door she tried- to pass without
speaking. -'
"What's the matter, girlie?" he asked,
as he caught up with her and fell into
step.
"Do go. away," she said crossly. "1
don't want ever to epeak to a man

"I don't seem to be â In * line for head

"Is it now?" replied Sandy.. "Weel,
weel; I dinna ken the Chinese* were sic

At 9 o'clock Ben Hoy put. up his
fiddle, took. a last affectionate look at
the clothesline, then went to bed. ; But
unfortunately for Ben Hoy and his sil
ver-lined dreams half a dozen mules
from Thompson'3 pack train got loose
during the night and incidentally
bumped into the washing. They
stripped it as clean as a whistle and
when they were discovered the next
morning one of the mules . had nego
tiated about three yards ot the clothes

"They didn't even spit out the clothes

But the failure of Ben Hoy to deliver
the goods did not interfere 'with the
preparations for the coming : festivities.
Doc Wilson- was the busiest man in the
county and the way he* contracted for
all: kinds of feathered goods, brought
the water of admiration to: more than
one hungry Jawbone. He quartered his
men 'In an old dance hall,' and when
the bunks has been screened with ever
greens" and the. 1 walls festooned with
bunches j of live oak it made a commo
dious and appetizing dining-room.
.Oh' -the 'afternoon of the 24th: the
Widow Burns and her pretty daughter,
Bess, came over from the Flat and had
a peep at the preparations. The widow
had to make a few suggestions, but
after Doc turned some of the bunches
of ; live oak upside down she was per
fectly satisfied and pronounced it a
dream. *
Of course, '. Doc had to stand In with
the widow, ; for he was going to ; marry
her- daughter,- Bess, and the old woman
was a good. card to draw to^ And there
was no stacking the cards on : the
widow. When Doc first began sneaking

CHRISTMAS
PUDDING...
around : the Burns homestead the old
lady brought him up-with a Jerk.
;"3ee here, "Doc," she said the second
or -third time, he called," "are you after
me or; after Bess?.{ If ; you. are after
Boss it's' all right,- and if you are after
me > it's all right, but I want things
understood -from the'start, for I am not
going to have any more Donavan busi
ness going â¢. on }n this: establishment if
I car; hqlp it, and I guess I can."
For . Larry. Dqnavan, with his soft
blarney and dsvil's own twist for love
making, had been Wilson's predecessor
at the. widow's. "But Larry got to mix
ing- his affections as he did his whisky
and one morning he arose with a bad
taste in his mouth.* . He kissed* the
daughter in the front room and hugged
the widow in the kitchen once tc-o often,
and when Mrs. Burns ; discovered that
Larry had a right-arm hug for, her
daughter and a left-arm '.squeeze for
herself she , did some: vigorous kicking
for a .woman of her. avpirdupois.> Of
course, Bess was too Indignant over
the affair" to ever mention it, but If
you wanted 1 a -sample of the widow's
oratory in rag time all you had to-do
was mention the down-trodden 'Irish
and you would get it â gratis.
So when Doc came a- wooing the
widow naturally j wanted to know in
which direction the needle of his affec
tion was veering, and Doc told her. I
"I'm after Bess," he said, laconical
ly, "and I guess, I can smooth out the
kinks that Irishman left in her heart
without any trouble."
So it v,as understood by, all interest
ed that it; was only a matter of time
with Doc and Bess, for. Larry .did not
dare come within telephoning distance
of the widow's tongue, and Doc made
love â  as vigorously as a man. killing
rattlers. ' f U â  \ \
"I may, not have any < f your; taildr
made , moves in lovemaking," he re
marked,'placidly, "but when it comes
right down to" passion, I can thrill the
female heart with the best of them."
But ennstmas morning came at last,
and with the first beams Larry Dona
van swung up the canyon and slipped
quietly into Wilson's cabin. The Chin
aman was up to his neck in turkeys
and geese and chickens all .. ready
for the. oven' when Doc and Larry
stepped into the kitchen. Larry
was to cook the - pudding, for he
had established a reputation as a
pudding cook . ; on ; several occasions
and Doc wanted this one to be a classic.
"Stuff it with twenty-dollar â¢ gold
pieces,'* said Doc,. "if you. think it will
as founder of the society I am al

"Motion? carried," said Billy. "What

"If your duty to ; the 'society' per-,
mita, inayil suggest at 10 o'clock

"I'll be there," Billy assured him.
"Say,\want to go to; a show?"
P,^I ibeg Â« pardon', " j said Cartaret, , with
an â¢ Inquiring inflection.
!'To â Â» the ; theater,", explained : , Billy.
"Y'see ' we were ' going to celebrate los

"'; "Say." we - don't want- to rub it in,"
expostulated ' Billy. .
improve the flavor any, but give us
fct/rnethins: that will linger in our mem
ories like love's first kias."
{ Larry grinned and noddea. "ill give
you the cream of me experience." said
he, "but now "don't be for telling any
body that I made the pudding, for that
old banshee of a widow might set ear
oÂ£ it and- be after turning ud her
nose."
"Oh, I'll take all the credit for cook
ing the pudding," said Doc, cheerfully.
."If the fowl are not flavored just right
I'll skin the Chinaman, but \ light or
heavy, well done, rare or raw, I'm
going to stand pat on the pudding."
- So Doc went about his business of
looking to Che final arrangements,
leaving Larry to solve the problem of
compounding the biggest pudding the
camp ever put d thumb into.
Ten minutes after this interview Doc
saw the Chinaman come flying through
the kitchen door with one of Larry's
big feet in close attendance.
"What's up?" inquired Doc. cau
tiously poking his head through the
doorway.* \ ;
'â¢Nothing is up but the Chinaman."
said Larry. "I just knocked him down
for sticking his heathen mug into the
affairs of a Christian pudding. But
I'll have it underway now in a min
ute, then he can have the kitchen to
himself and spoil things to his heart's
content. But the nerve of himâsug
gesting an improvement â Wurra?
Wurra! but he must have been neg
lected in the bringing up."
At last Larry finished his business in
the kitchen and sneaked off down the
canyon as quietly as he had come. The
Chinaman 'returned to his duties and
peace and happiness and the smell of
stomach-thrilling odors reigned su
preme.
By 1 o'clock the boys from the can
yon congregated and by way of a pre
liminary emptied a steaming bucket of
hot punch. "They need a mouthful of
the cheerful," said Doc, contemplative
ly, -"for the citizens of Tribulation
Canyon are up against a hard forma
tion."
And you could tell .the Tribulation
Canyon boys at sight. Only three
white shirts In the bunch, and two of
these.Avere nothing but flour sacks with
holes punched through sides and bot
tom for arms and head. Fate tried
to worry them, but the bucket of punch
completely routed sad times from their
memories and started Sandy Furger
son singing, -**O~ Willie .brew'd a peck
t-" inaut" -with a lift and swing to it that
set "mirth effervescing from the heart
to twinkle in the eyes and mouth and
happy-laughter. . Then tha fiddler came,
and with him the people from the Flat,
and Doc drank healths enough in an
hour to keep him sick for the remainder
of the. year. At last, like people of
quality, . the widow and her daughter
arrivedâ ten .minutes late.
When the widow and her daughter
rattled up . to the cabin In their one
horse turnout all hilarity ceased and
the people flocked out to see Doc re
ceive them. For Doc was big and
cumbersome and naturally clumsy
he had been known to trip over a
match when â  sober â and as he was
pretty well saturated with Christmas
joy and punch, the boys thought they
(might expect something startling in
the acrobatic line.
But .Doc assisted the flushing Bess
from the cart as gracefully as you
please. The widow being plumper and
heavier than her. daughter was a 'trifle
more generous with her weight, and
Doc staggered under his armful of
matured charms. But he landed her
safe and sound, -and the boys cheered
lustily and yelled for a speech. Doc
braced : himself against the widow's
moonreyed sorrel and .waved his hand
for silence.
"Ladles and gents," he began soberly.
"I don't think you understand," said
Cartaret, a little wistfully, "that the
favor, is yours. , It's been fifteen years
since I've had youns people about me,
and I should really enjoy your com
pany."
1 "We'll buy a seat for you and leave
it. at the. box office," declared Billy.
"Try to, get in for the last act where
the villain's crazy wife kills him and
three' choir boys-^it's great."
:: "I'll be there." said Cartaret laugh
ingly. "Such intellectual, joys are not
to be despised. Andâ If you will per
mit--" he 1 ended with a glance at
Daisy, and leaned over to whisper
something to Billy.. ,
: "Sure!" was . the hearty answer, ana
Cartaret arose to return to his office.
'' ""What did he whisper'" demanded
Daisy, as they again turned their at
tention to dessert.
/'He "i says, " answered Billv gravely,
'/that the jqb he wants me for needs a
steady, married man, and I] told him
I thought â  I 'could fix that."

"I feel like the biggest Indian In the
campodee â I could whoop for Joy. This
is the proudest moment of my life; yes.
even prouder than the time they didn't
lynch me for mule stealing, for my
soul warms to the blushes of a certain
fair one; my heart thrills to the music
of her laughter, and when the tlms
comes for her to poke her little hand In
mine and whisper 'yes,* I'll have to
wear high-top gum-boots to wade
through the oceans of my joy if I want
to keep my feet dry.' And when that
happy time does come, dear friends,
there will be a barbecue in this camp
you can smell from Tribulation Canyon
to the foothills. (Frantic cheers from
the Tribulation Canyon delegates.)
Now, good friends. I again wish you a
merry Christmas, and if your appetites
remain with you so Ions as the table
remains with your appetites, we'll
hflve one."
Doc bowed to his cheering admirers
and then led the way to the dlning
hall.
And such a dinner! A half-do*en of
Wilson's men acted as waiters, and
although they had an occasional fowl
roiling over the floor like a football,
they did fairly well, and landed most
of the things on the table. No cere
mony was the order of the day, but
everything went off very nicely, with
no kicking under the table. The hum
and buzz of the conversation' would
have made a phonograph stutter to
catch It. Irish. Dutch, Scotch, Ger
man and French, with now and then a
dash of Chinese from the kitchen.
whenever the cook burnt himself. And
mingled with this potpourri of sound
could be heard the steady grind of
hungry jaws, accompanied by the me
tallic click and rattle of knives and
forks. V.v, :
A dozen or so dogs had sneaked in
under the banqueting board, and aa
the youngsters persisted In feeding
them bones, they soon got to fighting
over the choice morsels. This tickled
the young people immensely, and no
doubt gave a baronial touch to the
scene; but when the ladies found their
ankles were in danger from the snap
ping teeth, they appealed to Doc, who
forthwith proceeded to kick the very
last cur of them into the street.
But at last a sigh of repletion went
round the board and Dqc ordered in
the pudding. It took two of them to
muster it into position on the table and
when it was properly flanked by two
bowls o* .brandy sauce it made the
Tribulation Canyon contingent sigh for
more stomachs.
"Good heavens!" gasped the widow,
"it's the most stupendous affair I ever
saw; you must have boiled It 'in the
reservoir."
Doc grinned complacently. "It's my
first effusion." he said modestly, "and
before I carve it I'll say right here that
there is one quality it sure don't lack
and that is â quantity."
"My conscience!" exclaimed Sandy
Furgeson, "but it's a grand sight for
a hungry een. Doc. That must surely
be the chieftain o* the puddin' race
that Bobbie Burns teels aboot In ane
o' his poems. I suppose it's superfluous
to inquire if it raised weel?"
"Raised?" said Doc; "why I had the
Chinaman setting on the boiler two
thirds the time to keen It from rais
ing the roof oft the kitchen. But it's a
sin against nature to keep so many
Christmas appetites in suspense, so
here goes."
Doc made a lunge at the pudding
with a huge carving knife and every
one held his breath. The knife pene
trated for about two - inches and
stopped. Dec looked puzzled and shook
his head. .
"I must have struck a change in the
formation," he remarked, pulling out
the knife and looking at it critically.
Then he lunged again. This time the
knife penetrated clean to the hilt. Doc
smiled and started- to cut off a slice,
but the pudding refused to disinte
grate. He bore down hard and sawed
at It, but the pudding seemed to have
the tenacity of. a bulldog and hung: on
to itself with a determination that
stirred the bosoms of the spectators
to strange throbs.
/'Better give her a sack of (riant
powder and loosen her up a bit," some
one suggested; but Doc was beyond the
reach of suggestions.
"Probably you struck a bone,** the
widow remarked sarcastically, her noae
reaching for higher atmosphere.
Doc looked at her helplessly, then
started digging at the pudding until he
uncovered the obstruction and held It
up In full view of everybody.
"A sock! a sock!" resounded from
one end of the table to the other and
the din of the commotion ratiled the
very shakes on the roof. """'
"That's what it is." said Doc grin
ning sheepishly, "and ( a damned old
gum-boot sock at that, im&glng by the
heel of it. Now, if it only had been a
nice lady's sock it wouldn't have been
so bad, but â " '
"Ladles don't wear socks," snapped
the widow, viciously.
"Don't they?", said Doc, innocently;
"I thought they did. At least, air the
ladies I ever saw wore socks or â " .
" "You mean stockingsâ you great Ig
noramusâlong stockings!" Tha widow
was using the loud pedal with both
&et/*3naMHI
"Well, then." replied Doc, "let us gtvn
thanks that it's sock Instead of stock
ing, for, being a sock, there isn't so
much of it and the Ies3 the pudding
Is flavored with â "
"I didn't come her* to be Insulted!"
screeched the widow, jumping to har
feet and kicking her chair over back
ward. -You will be saying next that
it's a clean sock and will aid digestion
when everybody knows there isn't such
a thing in the camp after Thompson's
mules stripped Ben Hoy's clothesline.!*
This last shot settled the argument.
Doc didn't say boo, so the company
broke ranks to follow, the .widow. The
Tribulation Canyon boys did remain to
sympathize with their fellow towns
man and help finish the punch and
brandy sauce, but somehow the flowing
bowl had lost its sparkle.
Doc went gunning for Larry Donavan
the next day, but Larry had left the
county the night before, taking the
blush'ing Bess with him.

Ofieving of BcoRs
DMtE one advise on the purchase
of Christmas books? v With
every book stall full to over
flowing with 'volumes in holi
day dress and rctill other belated ones
making their .'ippc^rance dally, has a
reviewer of books the "hardihood to
pass judgment, even though a hasty
one, ur-cn the merits of these wares
exposed to the eye of the holiday
chopper? Though his wisdom were
that of Solomon ard his tire'ess en
durance matched that of Hercules, yet
could the critic frivs but a halting and
piecemeal report upon the detailed as
pects of this sea of print. Noah on
the fortieth day. with the olive bear
ing dove not yet in sight and th*
boundless waters st'Il raging, must
have been in rir>e condition to become
reviewer for on** holiday season.
Reserving the jirivilege to retrace
the ground more at ler.gth in several
instances when thÂ» press of books is
lightened somewhat, the writer of
these columns will endeavor to give
briefly th* salient features of some of
the volumes on hfs desk that fall un
der the head of holiday books. â  For
the elders and children alike there
are enough to satisfy every degree of
Uiste. For the lover of a. book as a
book ther*Â» is reading for a year.
One of the most attractive books of
the season is "The Lace Book." by N.
Hudson Moore, author of "The Old
China Book" and "The Old Furniture
Book." Though the volume Is one de
signed primarily for the edification of
connoisseurs and those devoted to the
fascinating hobby of antique collect
ing, the reading of it by a layman will
be repaid with interest. Even when
the gruff old Swift made his com
plaintâ
Five hours (anu who can do it less In?)
By hauchty Celia Fpent In dressing;
The goddess from her chamber issues
Arra>*d in lace, brocade and tissues â
he but touched upon the chord of that
particular vanity which has been wom
an's since the fall of Eve, and ofttimes
man's. The author's chapter upon the
part lace has played in the sartorial
arts is full of quaint interest. It details
categorically the fashions of bygone
times, which exacted more strain on
the pursestrings in answer to the de
mand for ruffs, webs and lace gew
gaws than did ever the bread call. We
Mush for the men of Suckling's time,
"who felt the careful disposition of their
lace ruffs to be of more import than
affairs of state.
To illustrate Mr." Moore's more tech
nical disquisitions upon the various
schools of lace productionâ the Italian,
the Flemish/ the Spanish, et cetera â
the text is supplemented with seventy
excellent engravings, showing both lace
patterns and the manner of its wear in
famous portraits. The book is in every
way representative of the highest art
in printing and binding. The Frederick
A. Stokes Company of New York pub
lish it at the price of 55.
A book of solid material is Russell
Sturgis' "Appreciation of Sculpture."
Those of us on this coast who have not
been fortunate enough to listen to Mr.
Eturgis* lectures may find in his book
the essence of a complete course in the
interpretation of sculpture. The author
does not write above the heads of those
unversed In the subject of his consider
ation, and for that we can thank him
right heartily, for who has not been
chained by the occasional "topllftical"
tone of an art work that takes it for
jrranted that those not of the elect will
eschew its perusal? As In his former
work, "How to Judge Architecture,"
Mr. Sturgis alms to give the layman a
-working grounding in the esthetic sig
nificance of the art, so that one may
not stand dumb and unappreciatlve be
fore a Victory of Samothrace or the
Bartholome Monument des Morts. To

Is 6. E. Crockett's new book, "Raider
land." This the author does not pub
lish as a new Galloway book, but
rather x with the Intent "to focus and
concentrate what I have already writ
ten for the use of Galloway lovers and
Galloway travelers." A key to the
author's chosen country, then, is this
new volume, to be used â and let .us
not smile as we say it â in reading his
Galloway tales as we would use a
Baedecker in making the grand tour.
Sketches of things in and about the
border country comprise the sum. of
the volume's contents. They are well
written, because Mr. Crockett writes
well, but they are far from being ab
sorbing. Some Illustrations Jn rather
impressionistic black and white do not
add greatly to the value of the work,
which is estimated in currency at $2 by
its publishers, Dodd, Mead & Coi of
New York.
A book that will be snapped up by
Stevenson lovers is "The Wisdom of
Rob:rt Louis Stevenson," collected and
arranged from Tusltala's writings by
the Scott-Thaw Company of New
Tcrk. Those who keep "Virginibus
Pnerisque" on the eame familiar shelf
that holds . the Psalms of David need
no mere word* of advice. Lovers of
Stevenson are united. in a' brotherhood
of kinship. Need one* of them urge
the merits of this dainty Jittle leather
covered book of sweet philosophy?
Another reprint which will have an
appeal to a smaller circle c-f readers is
William Morris' "Golden Wings,"
which is published by 'the H. M. Cald
well Company, New York.' Those who
do not know Morris thoroughly may
experiment with this little book. It is
Morris in his quintessence.

LEGAL
Lore for Laymen
~* BOOK filled with matter of ln-
IJ structlon and worth for the law
â y.;\ student or the practicing lawyer,
and yet a book replete with
lively and entertaining matter for the
lay reader, is the revised and enlarged
edition of Francis L. Wellman's j "The
Art of Cross-Examlnatlon." ,
Unquestionably cross-examination is
one of the most difficult branches of all
the many that a successful advocate
must acquire. *It is ' in the cross-ex
aminatioh that, the issue of a case is
most frequently' brought to a focus.
Some one ' has ' said that success in the
art of â cross-examination comes \ rather
to the ; happy, possessor of a genius for
it. However that may; be, \ Mr. Well
man' his succeeded remarkably well In
reducing the principles of cross-exam
ination, so far as they may be re
duced, down to the grasp of even the
humblest student of the law.
There has been little attempt at an
exhaustively scientific treatment of the
subject. Whole chapters, such as the
one dealing with the cross-examination
of -Dr. . in the celebrated Car
lyle W. Harris murder case, .read like
engrossing chapters of romance." The
book is the fruit of a long and dis
tinguished career on the part of Mr.'
Wellman as one of the ablest and most
successful trial lawyers before the New
York bar. The subject matter, so far
as, was practicable, has been set forth
in the modern inductive, or ' casebook,
method of legal instruction. Appre
ciating the difficulties of attempting to
set down rules for a branch of the law
which must always. rest, for its most
signal triumphs, upon the advocate's
knowledge of human nature, his Intui
tive knack of catching the "weak
point" in. a .witness' testimony, at times
even his dramatic ability, Mr. Wellman
- has, nevertheless", succeeded in 'setting
forth the cardinal principles in the art
of cross-examination in a manner" so
simple and yet so telling that It must
prove of Inestimable benefit to every
lawyer who from necessity or choice
does courtroom . work.
All the forenslcs of the greatest Jury
lawyer. who ever played upon the sym
pathies or the passions of twelve s good
men and true are but wasted upon the
empty air, provided the cross-exam
iner has made his point. Jurymen
may be, and many times . are, . preju
diced against a lawyer who has the rep
utation for being a great Jury 'lawyer.
They are afraid and suspicious- of. his
power to swav with words, buV.even
the dullest Juryman ; can trust , his* own
powers of observation and draw .his
own conclusions when" a* witness: in. the
witness chair has^ been', absolutely idis-.
credited, tripped â¢ up with ( lriconsisten-.
cies or fatally ensnared .with"-.'contra
dictions. These . matters are the' field
of the "trial la\vyer," : and upo*n his suc
cess In their application rests, his case.'
Defining his subject, Mr. Wellman
Bays: '"Great lawyers have: {often,
failed lamentably at\their r cr6ss-exam-"
ination, while marvelous success has"
crowned the efforts of those who might
have otherwise been regarded as of.
mediocre ; grade in the profession. Yet
personal experience arid the? emulation
of others trained' in the . art" are the :
surest means i of attaining proficiency
in this all-lmnortant prerequisite, 'of
the competent > trial ', lawyer. It re- ,
quires the^greatest Ingenuity; ;a 'habit
of logical thought: clearness \ of per- â 
ception in general;, infinite - patience ;
and ' self-control; - power to read men's
minds intuitively; to ' Judge of their
characters by their faces, _to appreciate
their motives; "ability to act with force ;
and precision; - a masterful â  knowledge
of the subject-matter itself; > ah* ex- .
treme caution,', and, 'above jail,' the "fin- :
stinct Ito discover.' the' weak â¢, point, in
the witness under, examination." ;
The writer, then proceeded, to .take -.up
the t matter and manner â  of
cross-examination. In a '-chapter
devoted to; ; cross-examination". --of i
perjured witnesses â is ,- : given' a
verbatim extract of Abraham Lincoln's

'Just -'about ; the ; time :Prlnce -Valerlo
began to" frequent the Tennant marble
palace a strike - was threatened at the
mill and the air was filled with trouble
and ."discontent. An attempt had been
made to unionize the men at the va
rious plants,* and as this was contrary
to '< the : company's policy ' all . men who
leaned ' toward union sentiments had
been' promptly discharged. Among ;the
first to go was Manning, for in study
ing the subject he had decided that his
fellow workers were not very far
wrong. in many of their demands.
Instead of trying to arbitrate and to
pour oil . on . the ; troubled waters. v the
company remained obstinate and re
fused to^ concede to any of j the demands
put upon them.'and furthermore closed
and locked the doors of their plants un
til the men were ready to return at the
old hours and wages.
Hunger, cold and misery In every
shape and form was a catastrophe that
the; strikers .evidently had not figured
upon,, for when the winter .with "its
growing terrors , .beset .them,' ,they
threatened every form â¢ vt violence and
did*all;(they could to batter, down the
Jb'jections' and prejudices of the mill

sis when an old woman,' crazed .with her
â¢losses, stole into the' Tennant garden
and killed the company's presldent/arid
the fancied cause of her, own woes, as
he walked leisurely" about looking at
the various flower beds. â  m
This was the turning point of Beat
rice Tennant's life. Instead of marry
ing the Prince, a3 she had promised her
father on hlsdeathbed, she deliberately
broke, her engagement, disposed of the
great marbje home and went to Paris;
hoping, against* hope that she might be
able to forget the energetic young labor
leader, and the" look that she had unwit
tingly surprised Into his tell-tale eyes.
At the end of seven busy years, dur
ing Avhlch time Beatrice had devoted
much of her time" and money to the
working class, she again . chanced to
cross Nell Manning's path, but In the
meantime their circumstances had
changed not a little. He was a pros
perous business man, battling his way
through; life in such an upright, clean
fashion that he held the respect of even
those he was fighting against. On the
other hand, while she was still her own .
mistress, she was not . the pampered*
darling of the rich,, for adversity and
generosity had played such havoc with
her millions that but enough of her for
tune remained to keep her. from the ne
cessity of work.
Again the question of station, of edu
cation and of wealth began to perplex
her and the violent opposition of her
so-called friends made her long for a
life; that would 1 be- free from petty
mummeries and fancied etiquette. ; She
turned the question slowly over In" her
mind and looked fairly at both rides of
it. : On one 'hand' there- were 'hosts of
friends who would : iet her drop speedily

A LIFE
of the Great Poet
.ââ HE recent publication as an inde
fe> pendent work of W. J. Rolfe's
VX "Life of Shakespeare," which ap-
peared a year or so ago as a sup
plementary volume to the New Century
edition of Shakespeare, is a rare boon
to the students of the great dramatist.
It is well that Dr. Rolfe's exhaustive
work is. given the distinction of Inde
pendent publication, for it is in itself a
masterpiece of scholarly effort and a
complete review of the critical studies
that have had Shakespeare for their mo
tive since Nicholas Rowe published the
first biography of the Immortal poet in
1709. The â¢ appearance of this volume
separately has the added merit of of
fering to Shakespeare students the sum
of Rolfe's study, which would otherwise
be unavailable to all who did not be
come possessors of the complete edition
of which it was originally a part.
So long has Dr. Rolfe's name been
prominent in the ranks of Shakespeare
critics that the authority of his word
does not suggest Itself to debase. That

. note to his standard "Outlines of the
Life. of. Shakes^e'aie" should have re
stricted the measure of his indebted
ness, to five . contemporary authorities,
of 'which number Holfe was one, is suf

Rolfe has brought to bear upon his
work a' high power of discrimination,
for discrimination; can be the only abid
ing essence of Shakespearean criticism
in this day of intensive and sometimes
abnormally inventive delving into the
mysteries of the playwright's motives
and inspirations. So much that Is
apocryphal, so great an amount of
speculation, of deduction and. theoriz
ing confronts the Shakespearean schol
ar that his task to-day is not so much
a- creative as a critical one. Acting on
this well established hypothesis, the
author of the "Life of Shakespeare"
has made his entire work one of care
ful elimination and selection, so that
its sum total represents what one stu
dent believes to be the. kernel of meat
in the whole volume of commentary.
Chary of advancing new theories with
out a proper foundation work Qf legiti
mate hypothesis. Dr. Rolfe has devoted
the major part of his energies to top
pling over and exposing fallacies which
have received the sanction of haphaz
ard'theorists. Especially worthy' of note
is -his. leveling of the tenets of those
who deny that Shakespeare wrote
Shakespeare.
â ' Against â¢ the Baconians Rolfe brings
to: bear the accumulated evidence
drawn from the typographical execu
tion'of the first folio of 1623. Bv ad
ducing- the noteworthy 1 Incidents of
false proofreading and illiterate editing
manifested throughout the thirty-six
plays In the edition, and by instancing,
also, evidences which prove that the
author of the play.s credited to Bacon
certainly had not supervision over
their folio printing, the writer seems to
fix Justification for his assertion:
"That Francis Bacon could have edited
them (the folio plays) or supervised
their, publication Is inconceivable â ex
cept (to a fool or a Baconian."
'Rolfe devotes a weighty chapter to
the discussion of Shakespeare's son
nets. Was the publication of the son
nets in 1609 authorized by the author?
Are the sonnets wholly or in part auto
biographical, or merely poetic exercise,
modeled after the fashion of the day?
Did .they ring true with Shakespeare's
own spirit or was their sentiment llke
wise^but "the reflection* of literary
modes of the time? These are some
of, the questions Rolfe propounds. Not
only does he answer them, but he seeks
at the same time to puncture some of
the misconceptions of hasty commenta
tors.' That the sonnets were not ed
ited bv Shakespeare, nor their publi
cation authorized by him, is Rolfe's
belief; of their Dersonal* nature and '
sincerity he is convinced.
In a discussion of the great poet's
poems, notably "Venus and Adonis"
and "Lucrece." Rolfe calls to his aid
the interpretation of Coleridge in refu
tation of. the contention that Shake
speare sought only to glorify things
sensual through thorn. RoLfe contends
for a recognition in both prtenis of an
ethical and reflective element which
draws Its lesson from thy Intense and
brutal passion exemplified therein.

v Grove, Scraaton, Pa.
THE key of E and- its relative, the key of
. C minor, are presented in this lesson*. The
; -key of E is one that gives much trouble
to beginners in the ordinary method of
teaching music, because it has 'four sharps. The
notes F, C, G and D are sharps in; the key of K
and fare] consequently played on the black:' notes.
This is confusing, but is made simple by the
charts..
Place one of the charts at right angles with
the , keyboard, so that the small letter D with a
dash I above lit on the chart is directly over D on
the keyboard. Then the white spaces on the
chart will be over the white keys and black spaces
over the black keys. /
The top, middle and lower sections on the
lower chart represent the three chords, a mastery
of "which will enable any one to accompany on
the piano any song" or melody in the key of E,
and the upper chart represents the chords of the
key of C: sharp minor;
The black letters are to be played with the
left hand, the red letters with the right hand.
Now/: haying placed the chart on the piano,
play the black" , letter on the top section with the
left - hand : and then the three , red letters in unison
with the right hand. Next play the middle section
in the same way, then i the lower section, aridlthen -
return to the, top section. The small letter D with
a dash above it, which gives the chart position,
must not be played:. *] ;

Duchess Plans Beyond Her Means
LONDON, Dec 17.â All sorts of aueer
ctories concerning the financial affairs
of the Manchesters have gained circu
lation, owing to the action of some
Irish tradesmen and builders In apply
ing to the courts to expedite the settle
ment of their accounts for work done
at Kylemore Castle and for supplies
furnished. The extensive - renovation
and alterations still in progress there
have cost a mint of money â much more
than the Duchess at first ' anticipated,
when, in characteristic American fash-
Ion, she gave a carte blanche order to
"flx things up regardless." But as no
American millionaire whose daughter
has wedded a title has heretofore failed
to put up money enough to enable her
to "hold her own against the effete aris
tocracy of Europe, no doubt is felt in
society that Papa" Zimmerman will
continue to "make good."
Am the Kylemore bills poured In and
the figures mounted up the Duchess
suggested to her husband that they
should overhaul the accounts and check
off the Items and pee that they were
really getting something like 1 their
money's worth- The Duke shrugged his
shoulders. \ g
"Business is all Greek to me. and
bce'Ses it is a beastly bore." or some-
thing _ to 'that -effect he is reported to
have answered. "It is. your father's
money, and if you think there Is any
thing wrong with the bills, whyâ do
anything #bu like about them, but just
let me out/";-'
" So /the upshot was the. Duchess un
dertook" to overhaul the bills herself,
and the order, went forth that they
were-nojonger.to be paid on the mere
"O. K.". of the, Kylemore agent.
But she .found that she had tackled
a - bigger task than she had bargained

Amii Calm and, Peaceful Surpounclings ttie Monks
Are Kept In IanoFance of Affairs of tlie World,
STATUE IN MEMORY OF THE APPEARANCE OF VIRGIN
LONDON, Dec. 17.â Father Ignatius,
the; famous "Protestant monk,", who
denounces the higher criticism as more
dangerous to 'Christianity than open
atheism and boasts that he would still
believe everything in the Bible even if
it' said the" moon was made of green
cheese, has again â â  furnished - striking
proof of 4he unquestioning character of
his faiths ... ' . ,
At Llanthony, In a lovely Welsh val
ley surrounded ify mountains, where he
has established a monastery and sum
moned the middle ages back to life, he
Is erecting a beautiful memorial to
commemorate a wondrous apparition of
the blessed Virgin, which , he declares
appeared- there twenty-four years ago.
Time was when i such an ; undertaking
would have evoked a storm of angry
protest and derisive comment in the
English press, but the popular estimate
of Father Ignatius has greatly changed
in recent years. Even those who most
strongly differ from his religious .views
have come to respect him for his earn
estness and unselfish enthusiasm.
Many, have heard him -In America, for
he once preached a mission from New
York to San Francisco. . [>':*: /
His description of the apparition as
beheld by him and several of his monks
and lay brothers, recalls the numerous
stories of spectral visions supposedly
witnessed in medieval days', when the
church ruled supreme â¢ and ; scofnrig
skeptics ' were unknown. According to
Father Ignatius â¢ the Virgin's appear
ance was- heralded by a great circle of
light flashing out over the heavens and
illuminating the whole country round
about. In the center of this circle there
gradually, took shape a gigantic figure
standing sideways, with uplifted hand.
WILL ERECT A STATUE.
"In the distance," the. monk says,
"the figure seemed to be about sixty
feet high, but as it descended it as
sumed the ordinary size of a human
being. I saw. distinctly the outlines of
the features against the bright light
and . ajso the exact form of the;drap
ery, all as plainly and clearly as it is
possible for me to express." ; ',
It never appeared again' to 'tile -pious
watchers, but on each;recurring.anni
versary of the blessed vision, : Father
Ignatius and his little community have
celebrated the festival of "Our Lady^of
Lfanthony."- And now, having acquired
the necessary funds/they will give per-;
manent expression to their faith, in, the
form of a marble statue," representing
a female, figure with outstretched arms,
holding in one hand the lainp of .truth,
in which a light I will .be kept perpetu
ally burning. - .
Here the deyout . fatner fondly be
lieves that in the days to. ooriie . when
the church ceases Its efforts. .to recbn^
cile science and religion, and reverts to
the faith and methods of ,its v ; earlier
guides, pilgrims from afar will gather
in thousands for prayer andirispiratlbn
and miraculous: healing.'
HIS EARLY. STRUGGLES. 1
-'â : It i was ; hi ' 1861 ; that the ' Rev. , Joseph
Leycester Lyne. then a curate/ 24 years
pld, determined to embrace the '.life of. a
monk, while still retaining his allegi
ance to the English church. Assurrilng
the 'name of ' Father : Ignatius, â <. he', first
attempted to. ; found a ; monastery .at
Norwich. But the Bishop forbade him
to preach,: mobs attacked him arid. his
companions, and penniless arid in brok
en'health he was driven out, of .j the
town. For years thereafter his life was
a story of persecution, endurance, pluck
and tremendous, resolution ending in
1870 In the' calm of Llanthony Abbey."
But it was a ; 'sorry- haven :of refuge
he first found there. He slept for a
time. ir. , a cowshed^ while the r other
monks oceupied ! a windowless. barn

LONDON, Dec. 17.â Scarcity of
money among the English and Scotch
aristocracy h&t enabled Americans to
recure grouse moors at very cheap
rates this season. Prices are, on the
average, 25 per cent less than In for
mer years. There are more 'Americans
on the Scottish and Yorkshire moors
this year than there have been for the
last ten years.
Mr. Wa,terbury takes the lead easily
in the matter cf lavish expenditure and
entertaining. At Eraal Castle, tha
Caithnesshire property of Sir Tolle
mache Sinclair, he has a party of be
tween fifty and sixty American friends.
He has paid $23,000 for 5 the right of
shooting over the moors and the use
of the castle for the grouse season, and
It is' estimated that, with traveling ex
penses, the hire of dogs, guns and the
wages of beaters and other Incidentals,
bis expenses will not.. fall short of an
other $5000 a week. Georsro G. Fowler
of. New York has rented 40,000 acres at
Coigziaf earn for $20,000 for the season,
and he, too, is bringing a big party of
American and Parisian friends up to
the Scottish Highlands.
Broomhead. In Yorkshire, one of that
best moors in the British Isles, was
taken early In the year by a syndicate
of Americans, with Frank . Blbby of
Chicago at their head. The prospects
of a good grouse season were not then
encouraging, with the result that the
moors were secured for a mere song.
The syndicate has cleared $30,000 on
the deal.
. This ; same syndicate Is preparing to
exploit Wales and Ireland In anticipa
tion of next season. Irish moors can
now be acquired at ridiculously low
figures, and it is the intention of the
syndicate to buy them up and place
them under proper protection.
Waterbury has an idea, that grouse
may, flourish In the United States, and
with this object In view he Is making
arrangements that a quantity of eggs
shallbe sent out to him next year. He
proposes to try incubators first, and
if artificial means should fall he .will
have recourse to foster parents. He
Is prepared to spend $25,000 on the ex
periment.

where the work in the first and second
degree was exemplified under the di
rection of P. J. Moliterno, after which
there was a spirited talk by the noble
grand arch, who, among other things,
warned the membership to be true to
the principles of the order, which re
quires that no member shall willfully
injure a brother, either in his busi

The parrot helped things beautifully.
As is the fashion for artistic royalty
for the moment. Paderewski was

v*cy trÂ« content. Then, as I murmured
my pleasure in the privilege, etc., I
heard this in flt shrill, jovial voice:
"The dear girl! So nice of you; It is
not possible!"
If you can Imagine Paderewski look
ing roguish â and you must imagine
him much that he was not six years
aro â imagine it now. He drew aside
the easy chair that he had just taken
to show me a large cage behind It con
taining an appallingly wise-looking old
parrot In pink and gray. Polly was
evidently used to company. She perked
up her head jauntily and asked most
touchingly about rr.y health, her mas
ter laushing: boyishly the while.
In revenge I said: "Ah, I know why
you have the parrotâ to teach you
English!"
And in his delicate, careful, rather
hesitant English Paderewski replied:
"Ah, now I shall be afraid to talk to
you!"
We sat down then, Paderewski with,
his red-gold halo burning against. the
creen of the chair and reflected as a
smoky scarlet in the Steinway grand at
Lis elbow. Not the Paderewski of six

beauty of the face, the balanced brow,

by the low collar ended by a soft white
Fatin tie, the suitâ if you care to
know â of blue serge, setting hand
somely on the tall, well-built figure.
But the dominant effect was of health,
radiant health, and of a vital, essential
happinessâ in spite of the fact that one
interviewer had just left, I was there
and there were more to follow!
Perhaps the soft feminine laughter
that murmured in from the next room
connoted one constituent of the Pad
erewski content, for he smiled very
fcappily as he explained that Mrs. Pad
erewski is here and that my friend, the
parrot, was hers, and one of a numer
ous collection of chatter birds they
have brought with them from Aus
tralia. And then we began on "Manru,"
though it was Russia, her literature,
her people, her arts and ethics gen

"I like it very much," Paderewski
said quaintly â this of "Manru," his sin

operas."
"Of your*?"
"No," he laughed, then volunteered:
"Now I am busy with a symphony â
e.nd it is growing so long, so long."
"That is the modern tendency."
"Yes, and I don't blame the com
posers," said this one. "There is so
much, so much to say. But you cannot

one has not even time to talk! Think
cf the Mahler symphony, for example."
"Gustav Mahler, autocrat of the
Viennese opera?" I asked. .
"Yes. He has a symphony two hours

deprecating hand, "though it is an in

That brought up the Tschaikowsky

A BUSY lot must have been the

blending mystically into the

the red and yellow afternoons, and
sinking into an opalescent twilight.

"Ah. but that is beautiful! Gorgeous

always. Tschaikowsky spoils every
masterpiece with his waltz move

Now, I have something of a weakness
fcr that same 5-4 lilting, drawling
movement and so said.
"Ah," Paderewski laughed; then with
the drollest expression he threw one
hand in the air, reached for the floor
with the other and said: "Ballet! I
see this, one leg in the air, all through.
No, it is the weakest/point, and very
unworthy of the rest of the work. It
is the same with the piano concerto, in
the operas, all through, waltz, waltz.
I listen to the 'Pathetique.* but that
movement I could not bear to hear."
How did Slavic color come "up then?
It led to Paderewski deprecating what
is known as the Slavic note being so
regarded or as desirable to be so per
sistently struck. He asked: "How
would it be if in your national school
of music â "
"Thank you!" I murmured.
"I am supposing one," he jested, and
then went on, "but if the Dvorak 'New
World* symphony, for example, werÂ«
to be taken as a r>attem for all Amer
ican music, as it Is undoubtedly par
tially characteristic? The desperate,
sad songs of Russia, on which so much
of the Slav music is based, voice only a
part of the national consciousness. And
why not express the racial character
istics In absolute music?"
"You cet that dominant somberness
in the literature, too." I contended, "In
Tolstoi, Gorky, Turgeniev â " â 
"Less in Turgeniev than in the oth
ers," Paderewski reminded me.
"And he is the greatest of these,** I
ventured.
"He is immense," Paderewski said, a
delightful reverence in tone and look.
"He has the Latin culture superim
posed uoon the Russian. Ah! he is
national and beautiful. The others are
national and try to be as ugly as pos
sible! Whom is one asked to meet in
their pages? Mostly drunkards and im
moral women. There are other people.
There Is the sunshine as well as the
shadow. But think, now, of the three
most notable of the later Russian nov
els â Dostoievsky's 'Crime and Punish
ment,* the 'Resurrection' of Tolstoi, the
Gorky 'Forma Gordyeef.' Look at their
heroes â all alike. True, there are differ
ences of social standing, outside differ
encesâbut they have the same souls.
And what souls! And the women I It
Is a choice, perhaps, they think between
the interesting woman and the repre
sentative woman. These creatures sure
ly are not representative. No, I think it
an artistic mistake. The authors lack
esthetic measureâ and good taste."
I put iu a plea here for the art pur
poseful, for the argument's sake,
with a comment upon the. cruel socio
logical conditions upon which the nov
els are founded. I had forgotten then
that the Pole was a Russian subject.
He reminded me of the fact. Two of
his henchmen, who had been sitting in
silent worship for the most part, also
gently reminded me of the fact. It
means things to be a Russian subject!
From the artistic side, however, the
pianist was perfectly ready to discuss
the Russian. He resumed his criticism
of the novels aforesaid with: "You do
not see Balzac, Daudet, . Flaubert
or even Anatole France doing that kind
of thing. And think of the three great
ones, Shakespeare, Balzac and Moliere
â the latter for the comic side. Their
work is for all countries, all languages,
all times, and yet is most truly national
and characteristic. No, Russian art is

ly musical. As to the poet's soul he
said: . .
"What of De Musset. truly a great
soul, and that poor soul, Rousseau â he
was also a great soul."
Berlioz he dubbed a "great inno
vator," chief among the French com
posers, but not great among the great
ones. He told me of Hanslick's bon
mot on Berlioz and David, when the
works of the two were being given
side by side in Vienna at a French
festival. Said Hanslick: "David has
genius without talent; Berlioz talent
without genius."

Symphony! One had. thought not to
mention the word again. But there are
times. This Is one. At yesterday's
Paderewski concert we were to have
had a symphony orchestra. ' Orchestral
numbers were to have been included la
the programme, but chiefly, and before
all, we were promised one at least' of
the greater piano works, only possible
to be given with the orchestral setting
and which we have bo long been de
barred from hearing. An orchestra
under the, direction of Paul Steindorff
was arranged for,' even the concerto to
be given chosen, and we were congrat
ulating ourselves on the oasis to come
in the concerto desert. But it seems
that we had reckoned without our host
âthat is, without the powers that be
behind Paderewski. On learning that
the orchestra was only what â with all
respect â must be called a "scratch" or
chestra, that it would probably in that
particular form be playing together for
the first time, the Paderewski manage
ment decided to do without it. Nor can
one blame them. To get fairly credit
ably through a purely orchestral num
ber under the circumstances is not so
great a feat. To set a solo, where in
finite plasticity and readiness are re
quired, is another story. One had
hoped for the happy accident in the
connection, but one cannot blame the
Paderewski people for not taking the
risk. And so It goes. And only last
week Mary Shaw was gossiping of the
Boston symphony concerts, where you
can hear one of the finest orchestras in
the world, week by week, for 23 cents!
Oscar Weil adds the pretty fact that
500 25-cent seats are set aside, -and

Hother Wlsmer furnishes always an
interesting programme, and his con

here last Sunday â was no exception.
Mr. Wismer*s own numbers were the
Beethoven ' violin concerto, op. 64;
the, Sauret "Farfalla" and, in conjunc-
to fit them with parts.
"1 object most emphatically to the
uniformity of the method of teaching
which still exists in the Paris Con
servatoire. Ask a dozen students to re
cite a 'tirade* from Moliere and they
all will give you an identical reading.
You might be listening to a phono
graph. I term that the anti-natural
system and one which would certainly
never have been tolerated by Talma or
any of the great French actors of the
past.
"It would be wrong to change matters
too radically; for instance, to plunge
headlong into the Antoine school. It is
essential to strike the happy medium
between the old and the new schools;
to keep within certain restrictions, but
to cast off once for all the superan
nuated .traditions so prejudical to a
natural demeanor. Clear enunciation
and broad elocution are to be acquired
at the Paris Conservatoire, and cer
tainly they are not qualities to be pooh
poohed by the coming actor.
"A modern method, however, must be
introduced to temper these qualities',
which too frequently are conducive to
bombast and exaggeration. All my
efforts, if I do remain in New York to
inaugurate a French theater, will be
directed to a presentation of a repertory,
alternately classic and modern. The
same method I would introduce into
the conservatoire, and my pupils would
be trained in each style concurrently."

tion with W. H. Thorlcy, the Rich
ard. Strauss sonata for violin and
piano, op. 18. Perhaps the violinist was
at his best in the Sauret movement. It
was given with a charming mixture of
firmness and delicacy. Taste, tender
ness and sincerity were all-in evidence
in the treatment of the Beethoven con
certo, though the rendering lacked
somewhat in coloring and definition.
In the quieter moments of. the Strauss,

and earnestness. That he failed.; to

ity here required of the player. Mr.
Thorley gave a capable and musiclan
ly account of the piano score.
Mr. Thorley was also heard in a
group of piano solos that included a
"Valse Fantalsie" of his own, a work
of substantial merit, brilliant in char
acter, spirited and original. It was
very warmly received by the audience-
Mr. Thorley's other unrnbers were the
Schumann "Grillen" and the Chopia

is rather hard and dry, but he Is al

Mrs. M. E. Rlanchard was the singer
of the evening, and was in exception
ally good form. She gave the Brahms
"Immer Leiser Wird Mein Schlura
mer" with charming breadth, and her
favorite "Standchen," by the sama
composer, -with more than her com
mon charm. I thought, too. that la

Etoile" (Augusta Holmes) Mrs.
Blanchard showed the dramatic qual

Is accustomed to from the singer, and
the lack of which has before conduced
to a sometime effect of monotony la
her work. Fred Maurer fulfilled the
duties of accompanist of the evening
with his customary grace and sym
pathy, and the audience gave heartily
of its applause.
An exceedingly beautiful voice, a
rare temperament Mr. Fred Maurer
believes to be the gift of little Louvla
Rogers, who will be heard in a debut
recital here on December 22. Mr. Mau
rer, whose sympathetic support the lit
tle singer will have, invites the atten
tion of music lovers to the young girl's
work. Miss Rogers is but 15 years old,
a pupil of Andrew Bogart, and already,
by account, a singer of mature capacity
and extraordinary vocal gifts. Her
programme will include four of the six
love songs of McDowell, an aria from
Beniberg*3 "Joan of Arc" and songs by
Chadwick, Jensen, Massenet and Schu
mann. The singer will also have the
assistance of Hother Wlsmer, who will
play two movements from a Goldmark
suite for violin and the "Prelslled"
from "Die Meistersinger." Maple Hall
will be the scene of the affair.
Since the foregoing writing I have
myself heard Miss Rogers, and most
heartily indorse Mr. Maurer's dictum.
The little singer is indeed extraordi
narily gifted, both In voice and tem
perament. Those present at , Miss
Rogers' debut will probably be gratified
to recall the fact In some few yearsâ
not too. manyâ for there is every evi
dence of a remarkable singer to come.

Pusgert Is the air with fir and bal
sam. From the loins of the giants of .
the forests raÂ» garlands to gladden
the hearts of men. And sweet is the
ercsa tl^.t *is*s frcra the wassa.il
bowl, as the glad carolisgs of Yule
tide make music in the air. This is
the blessed tlzae when the privileged
classes peer Into the lives of the bÂ£avy
laitn, and en this glad green earth.
there is nothing more beautiful than
the tight of 11 y Lady Bountiful abroad,
ca her errand of tendernessâ all smile3,
all hope, ail health, all happiness â as
the brings nx-nta.1 and spiritual cheer
unto the feonses cf Hie lotrly, ev/en'as
the brings bread and wiae. For know
yc not that hope â a thin gray ray of
hepe let into a damp basement â may
v.-iden its beam unto a warm glow, if
the eyes cf the dweller be wakened -
unto its lure? â and following its magi
cal course, who shall say "what lieth be
yond? This awakening of hope in the
hearts of the heavy-laden is the sweet
privilege of leisure' classes, for none
else holds a surplus.
The pretty picture of milady abroad
in the districts of the poor is not so
frequent a vision as of yore, and all
because of system â that mathematical,
exact thing that has- made slaves of us
all, vith its bold facts and hard.rou
tine governing the beatings of our
hearts, and forcing us to refer our no
blest and most exalted impulses to a
cold, calculating â and therefore just â
board cf chanties. And wherefore, in
deed, lies justice in charities? j 'Tls
writ somewhere In a book that means
much at this Yuletlde eeason, that
charity knoweth no bounds, and that
there is no soul so wicked nor wretch
ed that hath not a claim upon us
that the further lost the souL the.
greater need of charity. . '
And therefore let blessings fall upon
her who plckt her own way through
the cul-de-sacs of the poor, leaving
behind smiles and words of good cheer,
sweet as the "breath of Lebanon," and â 
a faint .trail .of light, Invisible but felt
âa mental glow that lights the souls of
th* heavy-laden-
Then back to the home of wealth and
warmth goes the saint of the cul-de
eac, glad and gay â for joy cometh only
to those who give joyâ and o'er the
piping, pungent wassail bowl holds high
court. And rweet is her face en wreathed
in its vaporous greetings. Here's to her!"
â¢ â¢ â¢
So busy has been milady shopping,
flitting about on. her charity errands,
creating "trees" with electric lights
a-gllmrnerlng about It for babies, big
tod little, she Incidentally gave some
little time to diversionâ diversion for
which "bridge" has almost come to be
a synonym. -Methinks in the next edi
tion cf the Century, "bridge" will be
found a eynonymâ for that 6eductive
but stiff-backed word, "diversion."

less leader of cotillonsâ himself of

Ernest Wiltsee Is back once more to
the scene of his former festivities, and
being a genial chap is warmly wel
comed. - - â¢ijti'i'- ' ">:
Big affairs are a- whizzing along!
There's the charity ball at the St. Fran
cis for the benefit of the Nursery for
Homeless Children, coming off'on the
21st. Then there's the fancy dress ball
of Mr. â _ Greenway's parentage on the
23d. followed pn the 27th by the second
Assembly dance, the .two last to be
at the historic Palace.
That charity ball promises much In
the line of fun and. philanthropy, and
gossip tells of many stunning gowns to
be fetched forth in its honor. Assured
ly its object is. worthy the great ener
gies being 'exerted upon it, for the
homeless lltle tykes so tenderly cared
for , at the. home appeal directly to
every soul of us.
Children's Christmas parties are
p'retty things. \ Where Is there a'crea
ture who doesn't , wax Warm at the
joy that grows at these affairs, whers*
baby hearts give out the truth and
joyousness : and sincerity * in them?
Mrs. J. J. Moore's little daughter
made an Ideal hostess in miniature on
Wednesday last: when she entertained
at the St. Francis. On Saturday, the
24th, Mrs. James H. Follis will as
slsl her young son, Rklph GwinFollis.
to receive his friends.
Another dance in sight Is that plan
ned by Miss Carol- Moore, the clever
debutante, who, by the. way, seems to
have successfully run : the gauntlet of
the - "tabby cats." The scratchy ele
ment of the chaperones has accepted
her quite calmly,- quite, possibly
through the young woman's personal
ity. Another- charming -debutante is
Miss -Eugenie Hawes,'; who made such
a sensation at Del Monte during the
auto-meet through her. ; beauty and
her exquisite : gowning. ;
A clever hostess -Is Mrs. George Lei
bold, whose "days at home * at the Em
pire; are delightful. Mrs. Lelbold lls
stunning; In r a . white velvet prlnces3
dinner gown, draped In lace recently
worn at' an afternoon reception. ~ .
A pretty stir "Miss Leantine Blake
man has made ., among the smart set
by her declaration of, Intentions so
soon ; after) her 'charming cousin -had
renounced the devotions of .a ''dozen
nice Â» men " for â¢" Mr. ' Greer. ; And now
comes Miss Blakeman's announce
ment.- Still, 'tis ever thus. To him
who is upandidoing goes the reward
of the hour. - Sighing swains have no
place In the new order of things. Any
way they're unbearably stupid. Wom
en cf to-day want men of action.
Therefore, lads, busy yourselves at
something, be it polo or tennis or
golf, if your | thoughtful progenitors
provided you with-'a plenitude .Â©f^cou
pons, else you'll never win the heart
of a maiden worth the winning.
The contemplated departure of Miss
Pearl Sabln and Miss Irene Sabin is
creating, many expressions of disap
pointment. The Sabin girls have many
friends, and not without reason. Their
lovable dispositions and warm hearted
ness Insure friendship. Miss Irene Is
a debutante already in favor, and Miss
Pearl has firmly established herself, so
that the going away of these two. maids
will cause regret.^ The Misses Sa
bin expect to leave for Fort Snelllng,
Minnesota, some time in January, to be
absent. through the spring and summer,
as the guests of Mrs. Thomas A. Pearce.
Bookbinding as an accomplishment
and vocation is being followed to some
extent by our society girls. Nothing,
surely, could be more artistic, and If
utilized for nothing further than a per
sonal pastin?e it amounts to something
in the end. A few years ago Miss Ma
bel Deming of Sacramento, a niece of
the late Mrs. Charles Crocker, studied
the art of bookbinding and has become
very proficient. Recently during a trip
East Miss Cora Smedberg essayed the
same line and has achieved a desirable
end. Miss Smedberg and Mrs. Joseph
Tobin exf>ect to arrive in San Fran
cisco in a few days.
The standards of society are totter
ing when simple, ordinary courtesy is
overlooked. Politeness is not a form;
it is an act of appreciation or acknowl
edgment of a favor, and though that
favor falls- of keen Interest the re
cipient is, nevertheless, fully obligated
to recognize it. Society must and ever
will stand as an examnle: If Its meth
ods lower in tone the onlookers are in
spired with contempt, or at least a se
vere disappointment In their ideal. It
behooves society to constantly- view
Itself in -the light of an example, for
birth, breeding, education and .culture
are 7 -all accredited , to it. Culture and
education are woefully lacking, and
breeding, too, *â¢ when one. f ails _ to re
spond to an Invitation. This has be
come so common a breach that its con
sideration is almost dead.*and if resus
citated it will toe -through the employ
ment of- heroic measures. Consider the
humiliation of one who must beg to
extend hospitality. An Invitation with
out response, but often a greedy ac
ceptance of the hospitality itself! -Now
â¢hostesses are forced to* ask for repliesâ
a method once ; bizarre, but arrived at
by necessity. Developments will be
watched; .but let us hope f that true
courtesy/ born of. the Instinct of consid
eration for others, will arise of itself.

man, who promptly â¢ answered it by
stating that he did not see an auto in
the vicinity of Grant avenue and Geary
street, where he did both see and hear
the defendant vociferating so loudly
and excitedly as to attract to himself
widespread attention and deprive of
hearer* the various political, theo
logical, anatomical and other kinds of
putative experts who were ventilating
their respective views, and incidentally
obstructing the former thoroughfare,
last Friday evening. â¢
It waB while exercising his preroga
tive of free speech and regaling a small
but intelligent assemblage that Mr.
Taylor received the provocation alleged
by him. Philosophy was his theme, and
he had warmed to it and was rounding
a glowing period when the auto bore
down and hoisted him. As he ascended
he saw that the vehicle contained two
capped and goggled men, who simul
taneously shouted, "Look out, there!"
but not untirit was too late for him to
profit by the warning. While descend
ing he caught a glimpse of the big ma
chine mowing a swath through his re
cent audience, and when he returned to
earth he was able to sit up and take
notice the medium of his sudden bodily
uplifting had disappeared. Was not the
experience sufficient to upset any
man's philosophy? In lieu of wreaking
vengeance on the authors of his aerial
flight, swearing was the only available
means bv which he could unload his
pent wrath.
The case is under advisement.

Buzayell, the Algerian wrestler, was
attired in Algerian costume of many
bright colors and looked like a cozy
corner when he faced Judge Fritz to an
swer the charge of mayhem, the com
plaining witness being "Tom" Jenkins,
a catch-as-catch-can specialist, who
performed on the carpet with the de
fendant night before last and alleged
his abdomen was bitten while they
hugged. The Algerian, through the
French interpreter, pleaded not guilty,
and then the complainant expressed un
certainty as to whether he really had
been bitten.
"Even if you had been chewed, as
you originally alleged," said the court
to Mr. Jenkins, "this charge of may
hem would not adhere, as no portion
of your person was removed. Nor
could a charge of battery be substi
tuted, because the wrestling consti
tuted mutual battery. It would be
equally absurd to accuse the defend
ant of disturbing the peace, as the
spectators of the contest were there
for the express purpose of seeing the
peace disturbed. In brief, I do not
believe that this defendant can con
sistently be charged with any offense,
so he is discharged."
James Connors, whose larcenous
specialty was the plundering of houses
to which he gained admittance by pre
tending to be in search of a desirable
room, was given six . months on each
of the two charges of burglary proved
against him before Judge Cabaniss.
The complainants were Miss Bessie
Brown of 3359 Eighteenth street, from
whom the defendant stole 50 cents,
and Mrs. T. Thurman of 1913 Howard
street, whose purse contained $22 50
when he purloined It.
Grand larceny was the charge
booked against Martin Sullivan, who
stole a horse and buggy from Arthur
Jacobs, but it, was reduced to petty
larceny on condition that he plead
guilty, and then Judge Fritz rewarded
his concession by giving him six
months.
The complaining witness* non-ap
pearance was explained by the state
ment that typhoid fever confined him
to his home, and when the Judge pro
posed that his bedside deposition be
taken both the Prosecuting Attorney
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER IS. 1904.
and the stenographer objected on the
ground that typhoid was a com
municabie ailment.
"But surely you gentlemen are im
mune from contagion," said his Honor.
"After successfully dodging the vari
ous breeds of disease germs that float
into this court with each batch of
prisoners you shouldn't balk at meet
ing: a few of the typhoid species."
The hint was ignored.
Judge Conlan has taken under con
sideration until to-morrow the psycho
logical problem presented by M. J.
McCabe's plea when he was accused
of defrauding a chauffeur. After
hiring an automobile and keeping it
in active service almost three j hours
Mr. McCabe suddenly lost all recollec
tion of having even seen the vehicle,
and that was why he declined to meet
the chauffeur's demand for $15. He
also disclaimed the remembrance of
having Durchased drinks at various
places during his tour of the town,
but "the chauffeur said that could be
proved by the testimony of several
bartenders, whose reputation for ver
acity was enviable. The Judge will
consult proper authorities to ascertain
whether memory-shattering can justly
be added to the crimes of the chug
chug wagon.
Promotion of intercounty commerce
is not likely to be repeated by Joseph
Kelly for some time, as the 'charge of
grand larceny against him appears to
be strongly foundationed. The prose
cution proposes to prove that after
stealing- twenty cattle hides from
Thomas W. Corder's store at Bay and
Union streets, Emeryville, the defend
ant brought his plunder across the
bay and attempted to sell it to a
dealer at 600 Front street, where he
was arrested by Detective Bailey.
Judge Mogran has continued the hear
ing till next Thursday.
Mrs. Mary "To'mpklns was released
from her fourth term of imprisonment
about a month ago, and had hopes
that she could worry along in freedom
until after the forthcoming holidays,
but she abruptly relapsed into Inebrie
ty last Friday and was arrested.
"It's too bad," she said to Judge
Fritz, "for I had , about made up my
mind to have a decent Christmas din
ner at my sister's home."
"From what I have heard," remarked
his honor, "the Christmas dinner at
the county jail Is not to be sneezed at,
even by an. epicure." ~--.J?'.--- - -V
"You don't say so," Mrs. Tompklni
exclaimed, with brightening counten
ance.
"I do say so, and as you" are now
going to the county Jail for. thirty days
you will find out for yourself just 'how
true my information was." â¢
"Oh, thank you," said Mrs.. Tomp
kins. '
Giuseppi Franchino was peddling
vegetables on Valencia street when his
horse ran away and knocked down two
pedestrians ere it was stopped. The
policeman who arrested Giuseppi was
about to let him go again, because
neither of the persons struck bv the
galloping steed would swear to a com
plaint, when he happily thought of
asking for a glance at the prisoner's
license, Giuseppi had no license, so he
was triumphantly taken to prison and
charged with peddling without one,
but when the case was called before
Judge Conlan the officer's hopes were
again dashed by the defendant's em
ployer appearing and presenting a
license for which he had paid. Giuseppi
was accordingly discharged.

Edward and George Mero, young fel
lows, declared that their only connec
tion with the drenken man who dis
turbed the performance in the Chutes
Theater last Friday night consisted
in their proximity to him* but attaches
of the big playhouse affirmed that they
aided and abetted his creation of dis
order. Judge Mogan has given him
self till next Thursday to decide wheth
er the Mero brothers or their accusers
are best entitled to the benefit of the
doubt.
After his interruption of the show
the inebriated one disappeared. His
indecorum consisted of keeping his
hat on his head and smoking a cigar,
to : the great annoyance of persons In
his Immediate vicinity. As his head
'gear was a sombrero the folk behind
him' were deprived of the view of the
stage for which they had paid their
money, and the quality of the weed he
puffed was such, as to sicken all who
Inhaled its second-hand fumes. He also
hurled airy persiflage and contumely
at the stage artists, and to the shouts
of protest fro'm the indignant audience
he retorted in language both defiant
and profane. When the police arrived'
he was not among those present, so the
Mero brothers, Edward and Frank,"
were arrested as accessories.
Fred Kreling, teamster, pleaded that
he -misunderstood the instructions giv
en him by his employer, ; Peter, Qulnn.
"He handed me $6 and told me to go
and get a load." said Krelingr to Judge
Fritz, "and when I brought back the
load he kicked and .had me arrested
for drunkenness." .

GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP.
IX view of the future political programme upon which Mr. Bryan,
Mr. Hearst and Mr. Watson are agreed, no matter what their dis
agreements may be, caused by rival personal ambitions, the ques
tion of government ownership, uniting them all with the Socialists, is
sure to be an issue of great proportions. The first point upon which
they will all agree is Federal ownership and operation of the tele
graph as part of the postal system. Q?f(2
We have become accustomed to government operation o*f the
postoffice, and look with complacency upon the regular annual de
ficit in the General Postoffice, whichis charged off to the treasury to
be paid by the taxpayers. Yet the postoffice is a business plant oper
ated by the Government. If its administration were strictly business
those who use this public plant would pay for its maintenance in the
rate charged them for its use. But this is not done. They pay part
of its cost as ratepayers and part as taxpayers, and at the end of a
fiscal year no man knows what it has cost him to use the mails. He
can compute that which he pays directly in stamps, but what he pays
in taxes is not computable. Those who have thoroughly examined
the matter are of the opinion that a private business corporation
could administer the postoffice, at the present postal rate, not only
without a deficit, but could make a large profit out of it. But the
Government is unable to do this, through its charge for carrying let
ters is $i 25 per pound.
If a private corporation made that charge it would be denounced
as extortion. But the Government makes it and loses money and
nothing is said. Expert actuaries have estimated the results of gov
ernment ownership of the telegraph, administered like the postoffice.
In England the telegraph is part of trie postal system: Telegraphing
is cheap to the users of the plant, but the^annual deficit, charged to
the treasury and paid by taxation, is $5,000,000. Distributing this to
the mileage of the English telegraphs and carrying the deficit per
mile to the American telegraph mileage, it is shown that the deficit
here under government management would be $50,000,000 a year. It
would probably exceed that sum, for the English administration is
better than we could have under our system of government.
On the government railroads of Germany the system is different.
There the users of the plant pay for it and there is a profit instead of
a deficit. The rate charged to the user is all that he pays. He pays
nothing as a taxpayer. The result is a rate on German roads that
would paralyze American commerce, so greatly does it exceed the
rate paid here to the private corporations which operate our" roads.
Here if a loss occur through improper transmission of a telegram, the
corporation as a common carrier is held to responsibility and the
courts exact indemnity. But under telegraph operation by govern
ment, which is by sovereignty, there is no responsibility for loss and
indemnity is impossible. Now if a man lose, no matter how heavily,
by the delayed transmission or misdelivery of a letter, he has no
recourse against the Government, but must pocket his loss, and profit
only by his experience.
Xot long since we knew of considerable loss inflicted by a delay '
of twenty-four hours in the delivery of a letter. When it came ft j
was stamped, "Xot delivered for lack of time." That meant that the j
Government does not make efficient arrangements for prompt de- !
livery and does not employ enough letter carriers.- Under such cir- i
cumstances a private corporation would be mulct by the courts in !
the amount of the loss and would be judicially ordered to increase
its working force to secure prompt service to the public. But the j
Government is sovereignty and cannot be sued nor compelled to per
form an executive act by the courts. Government ownership sep
arates administration from responsibility. Private ownership keeps;
them joined ai.J gives a better service. Private ownership means a
business administration. Government ownership means. a political
administration. Between the two lies the difference between waste
and economy.
In this country only a small minority of the people have occa
sion to make use of the telegraph. A vast majority live remote from
telegraph stations and make no or infrequent use" of the wire. The
telegraph statisticians estimate that only about 5 per cent of our peo
ple use it. But the vast majority of non-users would be compelled as
taxpayers to pay the deficit for the benefit of the minority of rate
payers.
The demand for government ownership is based on the false
assumption that the Government does business better than the indi
vidual citizen. This is the Socialist claim. Socialism say's that
where everything belongs to everybody, then everybody, through the
Government, will do everything. The scheme is alluring to a cr
tain order of minds and is getting numerous recruits by foreign im
migration from the socialistic centers of Europe. But individualism
has made America what it is, the land of the greatest opportunity
for man, and it is inconceivable that Americans should deliberately
destroy the system which has done here more for men than any other
in the history of the race.
THE SOUTH RISES FOR LAW.
THE election has had one effect upon public sentiment in the
South, of which certain Northern States are called to take no-
TTce. We have recently commended the strong stand taken by
United States Judge Jones of Alabama against the lynching of ne
groes. No one has yet answered the reasoning by which he makes
it a Federal question. If the local law be silent when negroes are
lynched for offenses which would go to judicial trial if committed by
u . n^ men ' lle declares that it is concurrence of the local courts in
discriminating against the negro on account of his race and color.
The Federal constitution forbids discrimination between citizens
in respect to their right of trial. No man shall be deprived of life,
liberty or property without due process of law. That is the judicial'
process, and when it is withdrawn from a man because he* is black
and extended to another because he is white, the crime alleged being
the same, there is discrimination by judicial assent, and Federal juris
diction arises.
Since the election the local judicial authorities in some of the
States most infected by lawlessness and lynching have been moved
to take notice of the reasoning of Judge Jones, and as if by consent
and agreement there appears, in -quite widely separated jurisdictions
a determination to enforce the law. Judge Speer of Savannah Ga
in a charge to his Grand Jury, has ordered it to spare no pains to
detect and indict the men who are guilty of lynching. He declares
that when assured of due process of law the' large number of the
best class of negroes will be in alliance with the whites in disciplin
ing the disorderly and evil, disposed of their own race, and that
thousands of blacks will step out as supporters of the law when
satisfied that discrimination is to cease.
Following this is the declaration of ' Judge Wakem of the
Brookhaven Circuit Court, Mississippi, that he will leave no judicial
power unused in seeking out and punishing the lynchers in his dis
trict. Incidental to his declaration is the revelation that the "White
cappers" whom he proposes to punish have recently driven from
their homes in Mississippi a whole community of peaceable ne^ro
farmers, murdering three of them and banishing the rest. JudW
Wakem says that such crimes are abominable from the standpoint
of the orderly white population, as well as from the negro point of
view, and must cease, by the punishment and extermination of those
who commit them. He also gives assurance that the best class of
negroes will join the law-abiding whites, making common cause with
them as soon as race discrimination in punishing crime ceases.
Judge Hopkins of Georgia has published a letter saying that
the honor and good name of the South require an anti-lynching cam
paign and the sternest of repressive legislation. He recommends
that a fine of $10,000 be put upon any county that does not within a
fixed time punish l\'nchers. The Southern press backs up his pro
gramme with great force, and the apologists for lawlessness seem to
THE SAN FRANCISCO â " CALL,- -DECEMBER 18/ 1004:
AT THE CA LL OF FRIENDSHIP
DUSK was clouding: the landscape
as Noah Sterling," powerfully
built, with blue eyes in contrast
to his gray hairs, stepped on the
porch. He leaned against the
framework of the door and
smoked his pipe, apparently ob
livious to the voices floating out from
the kitchen. Yet he heard, for his
brows lowered and met above his eyes,
and his teeth shut sharply "on the
briar's stem. '",*"â¢
"I'll enter no family unwelcomed.
Your father has his pride. I mineâ"
The girlish voice was pitched high, and
broke suddenly. Then followed indis
tinct pleadings from her, / companion
whom she answered. "It's true,' all
true. But I'm in the mill, a mill hand,
while you â some day you will be boss,
you'll own all â you â " DC (
"Don't say it, Bess. I am the un
happiest oreature in the world, the son
of a self-made man. Father forgets he
was once a laborer, choosing his wife
for himself. I'll do thersame. Let him
do what he will with the property.
I've brains and hands.Â» His blood fills
my veins, and I'll win out â as he did."
"You are all he has in the 'world. I'll
not come between you â "
Xoah Sterling glanced Into the -dim
room. He could see Bess, fighting
against her love, and the stalwart son
of the mill owner, as he held her hands.
Xotelessly he stepped from the porch
to the coolness of the little garden. It
was quite dark when he returned, but
no light greeted him from the open
door, but a low sob broke the stillness,
and guided him to the girl's side. She
sat by the table, her head buried In
her arms, her slight frame trembling
with emotion. Xoah. watched her si
lently.
"Oh, Daddy Noah â my heart is bro
kenâ" The words were scarcely audi
ble. Sterling sat down heavily, resting
his work-worn hand on her arm.
"You sent him away bravely. Now
you -cry for him."
Bess cleared her voice. There was a
little laugh of self-pity % in her tone as
she spoke. . ,
"That's the woman of it Yet it's
you who spoiled me. * When did I ask
for aught â and you not give it to me.
Oh, Dad, If you could only help me
now,"
"You've Bet your heart on this.' You
truly love young Thadd?"
"He's all the worldâ" Sterling with
drew his hand abruptly. Impetuously
Bess flung her arms about his neck.
"Not that 1 love you less, dear, or
ever could! But you loved my mother
âyou understandâ you must, you are
all that Is left to me now."
"Understand â sure I understand."
Soothing her, he drew her to his knee,
and held her in his arms, as he had so
often done as a child. Comforted, she
prepared to retire.
"Are you not going to bed?" she
questioned, her candle illuminating her
heavy eyes. â¢
"Presently, childâ"
Yet he had scarcely stirred when' the
gray dawn showed in the east. Then
he rose stiffly, determination in his
be losing their hold upon public opinion. . It is now said with con
fidence that they were only a violent and noisy minority any way,
and acquired their influence by bluster and the approval of public
men like Tillman and Vardaman. Now a different sentiment is
abroad and the courts are speaking in tones heard ' and heeded
throughout the South. Honor and manhood are as precious there as
anywhere in the world, and when the' idea gets abroad that lawless
ness puts a bar sinister upon the honor of every Southern State the
law will be vindicated and its violators punished.
* But let not us of the North be patronizing or complacent in the
matter. We have law-defying districts. We have lynchings of ne
groes and of white men and white women. Now that the South is
removing the mote from its eye, let the North observe the beam in
its own. We have gone to the spall heap with great assurance to
get/ a stone to cast at our Southern countrymen when we had but
little call to stand among the accusers. The criiicjzed may turn
critic and we may be taught our duty by those whom we have freely
accused of neglecting theirs. '. t '.' V v
One suggestion naturally occurs. As. the crime of lynching has
not been sectional, though most prevalent \n the South, the campaign
against it need not be sectional. Kansas, Colorado," California, In
diana and many other Northern States have had their share of that
kind of. lawlessness, and we do not recall a single case in which the
crime has been punished. When its punishment was attempted, in
this State the Judge who tried to do his duty was baited on the bench
by the defense, and probably several of the criminals sat on the jury.
Of course there was an acquittal and vindication of the accused, and
the murder of five persons goes to this day unpunished. That they
were humble or that they were criminal did not excuse' their murder.
They were the victims of crime, but the, greatest sufferers were the
people of California, who stood" by and saw the law defied and de
nied vindication. ;â¢ _
/ We hope to hear Judges in Northern States where lynchings oc
cur imitate their judicial brethren of the South in characterizing the
crime and calling for its punishment.;. ' â '.
AN ODD ORANGE TREE.
T* has been supposed that the orange tree at Bidwell s Bar was
the oldest in Northern California, the real pioneer of the great
orchards that are spreading over the Sacramento Valley and its
inclosing foothills. But its claims are now disputed. The Sacra
mento-Bee reports an orange tre& in "that city known to be fifty-five
years, old and with a productive record of 1500 sound oranges in a
season.
The history of this tree, five years jmore than half a century old,
is ; very interesting. The State Board of Trade should have a pic
ture of the tree for its museum. It was brought, a mere sprout, in
a small oyster can from Honolulu in 1849 by Thomas Hanna. He
gave it to Mrs. Crump, who planted it 611 her city lot in Sacramento
in 1851. Six. years later the lot was sold and the Crumps. moved
to a ranch and took the tree along and planted it on their hew
place. Tree and family remained on the ranch several years. Finally
the Crumps returned to;Sacrame*nto with the tree, which was again
planted dn what is. now the Clunie warehouse site. In 1869 it was
again removed, and^ planted on the; present Crump home, wherefit
has since grown in peace and borne in plenty. !
It attained such size that it had to-be pruned. -Last year, the
fruit was small arid it was fertilized with/ fish, well: forked in around
itV'The renewal of its ; vigor was remarkable and it is expected* to
beat its own record of. 1 500 oranges. V In its rejuvenation is a sug
gestion to orange growers in the matter .of fertilization. There has
been much discussion over â  orange fertilizers^ Why not use fish ?
On the Atlantic [ seaboard is a bony .fish called the . moss-bunker; of
which millions of pounds are converted into fertilizer. If -fish f be

TEACHERS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS LOOK
THE STATE SOLONS TO PASS TO MEASURE
PROVIDING FOR INCREASED SALARIES
"few, if any, more important
F measures will be laid before the
next Legislature than the one
designed for the increase of the
salaries of the public school
teachers of California. It is a
measure that is fraught with
consequence "to the entire school sys
tem and hence, as education 1Â« the
foundation of the State, is of univer
sal interest.
( .-â * From the standpoint of justice to
.the teachers, the plan merits the most
careful -consideration. Though the
cost of living has largely increased
within the last five years, teachers' sal
aries have not in this State, with the
exception of a. few cities, been ad
vanced. Wages and salaries in nearly
all other pursuits in life have been in
creased, while the compensation of the
teacher has remained practically sta
tionary. The mere statement of this
fact proves the contention of the
teachers that they are entitled to equal
recognition. A circumstance which
has an important bearing upon this
question of salary advance, from an
equitable point of view, is that the
teaching standard is quietly but con
stantly rising. Such is the insistent
demand of this age for the best in
struction obtainable, so great are the
opportunities afforded for gaining
knowledge in the fields of science,
history, the languages and literature
that the great body of teachers Is real
izing, as never before the Importance
of their own individual growth. Helps
of every kind abound in the nature of
professional Journals and books, pri
vate Instruction, ' university extension
courses. Institutes, State associations
and summer schools. All these have
their value in raising the ideals of aa
Instructor's life and in molding that
Important element of a teachers' in

the selection of a teacher â the ele
ment of a strong, sincere character.
It should not be forgotten that tha ac
quisition .of these rich essentials of

of much time and strength, but an un
ceasing outlay of money.. 'â .,â â¢ ;..-;* r
TEACHING STANDARDS.
. Before answering the query, "What
are the teaching standards now re
quired in progressive regions?" It will
not be amiss to look for a moment at
those of an older time. As late as 1840
the district schools of New England
had in their winter term the sole term
of the year for scholars of all ages.
The teachers were generally men who
were working their way through the
academy or college. They were paid
$10 or $12 per month and "boarded
round" in the different families of the
district. The qualifications required
were mainly those that Lincoln de*
scribed as ability to teach, "readin*,
wrltln' and cypherin* to the Rule of
Three."
What are. the teaching standards of
to-day? In' brief,' compared with
those of 1840, the difference is almost
Immeasurable. In no uncertain man
ner the leading and even the lesser
cities are demanding that their teach
ers must have obtained professional
training. Normal school training for
the grade teacher and a collegiate edu
cation for the high school instructor
are rapidly becoming (he requisites to
employment in the best cities through
out.the land. Scholarship that is both
broad and deep, close professional
touch with current events and techni
cal knowledge for particular positions
are assuming' greater importance in
every successive year with boards of
education in. all parts of the country.
Increase of teachers' salaries is not
only demanded by a sense of justice to
the profession, but also by that senti
ment which is said to know no law â
the sentiment of necessity. The expe
rience of the last three years shows
that it is impossible to retain the serv
ices of the best men teachers on exist
ing salaries, for, the simple reason that
other 'pursuits will afford a larger in
come. ' : .; 1\*% : â¢-.-â ' ""â ..
FEwfal MEN TEACHERS.
Not 'only' are the ablest men leaving
the schools,' but, as , must necessarily
follow, 'few* are 'preparing' to teach. It
would* be- a grievous misfortune to thÂ«
public schools of "the United States If
the teaching r force j was . composed
wholly of either 'one; of the sexes. It
can hardly -be questioned "that In what
is sought as the ultimate products of
the schools, the foundation ef citizen
ship and the formation of character,
both masculine and'feminine influences
should toe- blended." Women are In
comparably the best teachers for
young children and for others till they
reach the age of adolescence. Con
ceding that some women are so com
pletely endowed ' that they are emi
nently successful as -sole' teachers >of
youth and as principals, it holds as a
general truth .that when, the stormy
period of; adolescence is reached there
is vital need of^a power which will, not
only supplement but will -be the com
plement of woman's grace arid per
suasiveness, v The virile" influence of
strong, forceful manhood Is" then re
quired, absolutely â¢ so with boys and
but little- less, with- girls., â 
In admirable words a recent writer,
Richard L. Sandwick, In the Popular
Science Monthly, has stated the atti
tude of boy nature, at, this stage of life.
Mr. Sandwick says: "At this age boys
begin to notice differences of sex. They
are proud of their masculinity. The
voice changes; they. are conscious of
superior strength and they love to
show their * muscle, f They cultivate
gruffer ways- of men and often, learn
to smoke and;chew, not because they
want to .be -vicious, but because men
use* tobacco and women do not, and
they want to emphasize 'the. fact they
are men. From 1 fourteen to twenty
they love football. It is a game that
call3 for masculine and mas
culine courage. So, everything that is
distinctly masculine is admired and
imitated; everything womanish is de
spised. Few boys at this age are ready
to admit that women are the equals of
men. . Even? the mother's influence
wanes. Her .word is not final in every
thing. She Is only a woman and.can
not understand all that irien should do.'
; .WOMEX AT DISADVANTAGE.
So it; is in school. The woman
teacher is at a disadvantage with high
school boysj, % She must, be of a de
cidedly, strong .personality to appeal to
him. He sees intuitively that the tastes
and preferences of women are differ
ent from those of men, and he is not
at all ready to take a woman teachers
advice in choosing a course of action
for himself.
There is a startling contrast between
! the average wage oaid to operatives,
I skilled and^unskilled, throughout ths
United States Â£#d the average salary
paid to men teachers. While the av
erage operative receives $498 annually.
the average man teacher gets but $33 7.
IWltli such an exhibit from the census
of 1900 It is 'not surprising that the
percentage of men who enter teaching
has fallen in eight years from twenty
seven per cent of the whole number of
teachers to seventeen' per cent. If
such a decrease were to continue for
the next eight years it is evident that
men would be nearly _ eliminated from
positions in the classroom.
These findings and the extensive aM
thorough insight obtained by wide vis
itation evidently made a strong Im
pression upon the . German commission
of educational experts which recently
visited this country- Their views -were
summed up by one of the members.
Dr. Knypers, who said: "More virility
and the. choice of teaching by larger
numbers of well-trained men appear to
be the two things that American
schools are most in need of."
The Teachers* Club of Alameda
County, through a committee of which
C. E. Rugh is chairman, has recently
Investigated the salary question as u
stands to-day throughout the United
States. Mora than 200 requests for
information were sent to various alties

No finer recognition of teachers*
work has lately-been madÂ» In Califor
nia than that rendered by the city of
Stockton, where the salary schedule
has been readjusted. The minimum
annual salaries now paid to grade
teachers are $600; the maximum sal
ary is $900. Oakland pays a minimum
of $660 and mlximum of $840 â  and
$900. San Francisco pays a minimum,
of $720 and maximum of $996.
The requirements of the Stockton
Board of Education are high. They
embrace a high school education or
its and a course of profes
sional training, constant professional
study, sympathy with children and
kindly disposition and unexceptionable
moral character. The board Btates in
its Report that "the more extended
training now required of teachers
takes from two to six years longer
than was formerly needed. What
with this time and the cost of board,
books, fees, clothing, etc. the Invest
ment made by the trained teacher In
preparing for her li(e work Is fully
equal to the initial demanded by other
professions. In no other calling is
more study required to keep abreast
of the times than in teaching." G. O.

"A most excellent idea," says tha
Marysville Appeal, referring to Tha
Call's rose plant offer. "Bbc growing
rose plants constitute a premium of
practical value," continues the Appeal,
"and if the offer meets with tha ready
acceptance which seems likely. The
Call management will have a big un
dertaking on its hands attending to
the distribution of plants."

there transparent natures, sweet spir
its and exemplary lives that would
adorn any society, and which make up
the beautiful in slumdom.
There, where least expected, where
least encouraged, is the patience sub
lime, the faith divine and the sacrifice
heroic. These are the more precious
and commendable because found
where so much would thwart the
growth of the truer, nobler nature.
Should it not be infinitely more easy
to be patient when one never knows
the qualms of hunger than, in . an
abode where are huddled together
famine-stricken children? Should it
not be less difficult to bear the bur
den of bereavement ' where friends
surround one with comforting voice
and assurances than where one
stands alone With no human friend,
and only the harsh utterances , of
those to whom you have become a
"nuisance." If the jewel is to be

little matters whether it lies in: the

Homes that are beautiful! Made
beautiful how? .
â  Made beautiful by winsome and in
nocent childhood. - It is perhaps \ no
exaggeration to say that some of the
most beautiful children we have ever
seen have been among the lower - ele
ments of society. Remove from those
abodes, which poor, patient people re
gard as homes, the two, three or four,
bright, cherub-faced, merry children,
and you at once remove the possibil
ity of all home life and the last home
joy from its cup, leaving only the bit
terness of the dregs of sorrow, drud-;
gery and despair. >

There were but a few articles of
furniture, bare walls, no carpet on
the floor, yet their room was clean
and orderly. After telling us some
thing of the weary grind to earn- the
small pittance that kept thejr home
together, she turned to remark, "The
children are the best of all I have,
sir. I do not know what I should do
without . the children."
It needed bnly v a glance at the
faces of those little children, clear, in
nocent and pretty, to Know something
of their worth to that Italian mother.
In my mind's eye I pictured them
dressed in the goodly apparel ' of some
of the: wealthy of our illustrious ave
nues, and; a more charming picture
it would be difficult tojmagine. One
of the little ones taken to one of. our
children's homes from one of the
worst i neighborhoods', in the city
proved'to be so sweet a dispositioned
and obedient child that it was a won

could have come from such a miser

that these are exceptions. We do not

Yes, by true motherhood.
Let it not for one ' moment ' be'

got beyond th' first sintince, which was: 'It
is simply impossible to define simplicity.' It
ain't simple to be poor, it ain't simple to be
without clothes/ it ain't' simple to.be pious
or sober. 'Ye're pretty simple to believe all
I tell ye, but ye may not. be as simple as I

will be found that in -some instances
there â¢ is more personal care 'and pa

A lady who was making a visit to a
home in one of the worst sections of
one of our large cities asked how it
was that the little 'children were all
so well mannered arid implicitly.obe
dient, and the answer was that the
mother was in every sense of â . the
word a guardian and protector, and
that, during the few hours which
she- could give them . when they
were not . at ..the public ' school,
she would gather them around
her knee and, summoning all her

calculated to impress upon the child

readin' me out iv a book th' other day

was a tur-rble shock to. me. This fellow
says that Robert Morris, who I supposed
sacrificed his fortune f'r liberty, injooced th'
Governmint to pay good money f'r bad;
Jawn Adams wanted to make a kingdom iv
th' counthry;, while as f'r George Wash'n
ton, he acted like a coal-oil Jawnny whin he
wint to th' White House., an' his wife put
on insuff'rable airs, an' had such bad table
'manners that this here pathrite was com
pelled to leave th' room an'- run home to
a woman to watch over an invalid
father and sick little girl where life
was slowly ebbing away and sitting
during the silent watches of the night
ministering to their physical needs, to
stand in. weariness of body and mind
many consecutive hours during the
day at a hard and thankless task as
the bread winner of the family. Could
life exist long under such circum
stances? 'One thing is sufe, that while
life lingered and, strength held out
the element of patience burned upon
the altar of that heart. Weary, weary
hours, weary, weary nights and days
spent in the two little rooms which
were home to this woman, until death
came as a benefactor and removed
one- from its midst, and then remained
but; the little', child. \ .
.You say "not such a burden to pro
vide for!" Ah, but there was the
funeral and the expense and the strag
gle to "catch up," and that meant fur
ther sacrifice and a still greater exhibi
tion of that patience which was little
less than divine. Yet this home was
beautiful, beautiful in the eyes of God
and beautiful in the eyes of angels if
viewed from t the. standpoint of one
who said, "Bear ye one another's bur
dens."
Beautiful homes in slumdom^ Yes,
made beautiful through sacrifice.
'It has become fashionable at some
time of the year^o take part- in some
sacrifice and self-denial, but in the
great, sad - heart of slumdom there is
a perpetual Lenten season, and life
is little better than pne unbroken act
of self-denial. There are many things
| which the bread-winner could wish
to have .that would make life. a little
smoother, and the humble home more
durable, things that are necessary to
relieve pain, keep -out the cold and
satisfy- the - cravings of ' hunger, but
thelittle has to suffice in. the place of
the much, and the half loaf in place of
the xwhole one. Instead of the luxury
of self-satisfaction, there-is the pinch
of I self-abnegation.'
if a polecat, a polecat; if a man, a man. But
put it down in his diary.
"An' there ye ar-re. Th' more I think, th'
less simple simplicity becomes. Says Wag
ner, via Hogan. a man shud be like a lamp
an' th' more light he sheds th' betther man
he is. That's th' throuble with ivrybo.dy
that thrics to advise me to be something I
ain't. Whin I run him into a corner an*
say, 'Come on now an' make good, show
me th' way.' he tells me I'm a lamp, or a
three, or a snowflake blown be th' winds,
or a. bur-rd in a gilded cage, or 'a paint
brush, or a ship, or something else. But
says I: "'I'm none iv these fine thing3. I'm
a kind iv a man an' I'm not mintioned in th'
botany or th' mail ordher list. Tell me
what I must do.' An' he looks me in th*
eye an' says he: 'Be a man.' An* there ye
ar-re. If a man's a lamp, it's because he
smokes, don't show up well in th' sunlight
an' will wan day be blown out. There ar-re
other simple uses f'r lamps besides givin*
light, which is wan iv th' poorest thirig3
they do nowadays. Rothschild thrades in

"I don't think ye know such a lot bout

"I know more about th' sample life," said
Beautiful homes in slumdom? Yes,
made beautiful through courage.
Not on the battlefield alone, amid
the whistling of shot, the gleam of
bayonet and the roar of cannon is
courage to.be witnessed. Often have
we thought that could the field of war
be changed and the r.eld of loneliness
and poverty in the slums be substi
tuted, the courage exhibited by the
soldier would stand a slim chance in
comparison with that of the hero of
tne 'slums.
In the heart of the tenement dis
trict of Twelfth street. New York
City, a little boy not more than 8
years of age was found by the Vol
unteers, who presented the truest type
of heroism. His mother and four
brothers had been deserted by ths
father of the family. Shortly after his
mother was taken very side and lin
gered at the peint .of death. One
awful night, rjin-swept and wind
driven, the child rose at the moans
of his mother aÂ«d went out to try to
find the house a! a wotaan who had
acted as nurse for several nights. Bat
the tenement door was locked, and
not being able to make himself heard
the little fellow paced up and" down
the sidewalk until 6 o'clock in ' the
morning. Who can estimate the an
guish that filled that boy's mind? As
soon as the woman was reached at
day dawn the question that filled the
little hero's â¢ thoughts were food for
the starving family, and when this
was obtained from the Volnnteeri,to
whom he turned, the little fellow
would not touch a mouthful until his
mother and four brothers were fed.
Heroism! Ah, that is not always
the truest heroism that may be called
upon suddenly to face danger; there
is even a higher type; that which con
tinues day in and day out, through
the long, lone, unrelenting years, with
standing the strain to heart and brain
and nerve, the constant suffering of
pain, and all this, even of tea in the
face of inevitable fill art. j '

CASEY WILL NOT
BE REAPPOINTED
Mayor Sclimitz Says Pres
ent Works Commissioner
Will Go Out of Office
FORECAST IS CONFIRMED
\ 7
His Honor Declares Most
of the Foreshadowed Se-
lections Will Come True
Mayor Schmitz yesterday officially
confirmed in a majority of instances
the forecast of probable appointments
on" the .various boards and commissions
which was made in The Call several
days ago.
The Mayor stated that Dr. Jules
Simon, whose appointment was fore
shadowed in these columns more/ than
two weeks ago. .would be named to
succeed Dr. J. C. StlcBon on the Board
of Health, although the appointment
might be delayed until the beginning
of next year.
The Mayor further stated that the
commissioners who are sure of being
re-appointed on January 8 next are
Aaron Altaian on the Board of Edu
cation; J>r. Joseph F. Poheim on the
Board of Health, and H. M. Wreden on
the Fire Commission.
The Mayor would not commit him
self as to the re-appointment of A. W.
Voorsanger on the Election Commis
sion, but intimated that he stands a
good chance In the event that other
political complications do not arise.
He also confirmed the announcement
that David J. Oliver Jr. would be taken
care of. In all likelihood Oliver will
be placed on the Civil Service Commis
sion should present Commissioner Rog
ers secure another -office through the
influence of his friend, Congrressman
elect Hayes. The Mayor says he will
re-appoint Rogers should he so desire
and in that case Oliver will be pro
vided for in some other place.
The Mayor stated positively that, he
would not re-appoint present Commls-
Fionef of Public Wprks Casey to suc
ceed himself.^ ' His Honor has several
names under consideration, but de,
clined to mention who they were, as no
final selection has yet been made. His
mind is evidently made up regarding
Casey, judging from the following:
"You can rest assured," said the
Mayor, "that I will not re-appoint Ca
eey, even though the highest pressure
is brousht to bear upon me to do so.
I have never forgotten how Casey
treated me when he formed a combi
nation with Marsden Manson, then
Commissioner of Works, to the exclu
sion of the other commissioner I had
appointed. A man who deserts you
once may do so again and I am taking
no chances."
The Mayor was reticent as to the
man who would be put on the Police
Commission to succeed Howell. That
Is the office which may engender a bit
ter fight. Dr. George L Drucker is the
only one of the aspirants whose name
has been given out and he - seems . to
be a strong candidate.

made fixing bail and no complaint had

convicted. December 14 was fixed as
the day for judgment and sentence and
then continued until Friday^ on jvhich
day. it is said, all of the defendants ap

Assessment Without ; F.Taminmg
Chemical Concern's Books.
Another round in the fierce fight be
tween the Peyton' Chemical Company
and the powder trust was had in Judge
Kerrigan's 'court} yesterday morning
and ' the Du - Pont side succeeded In
getting, a postponement until Wednes
day In order to permit the preparation
of replies to the Peyton afildavits.The
attorne5-s for the chemical company
wanted the court to hear and deter
mine the validity of the assessment of
$10 a share, urging that ; there is little
time remaining until December 31,
when they, must pay the trust $113,000.
Attorney J. J. Barrett opposed this
proposition strenuously. "How do we
know whether to pay this assessment
or let the shares go. They will not
lot us examine their books.' We want
to know the condition of the corpora
tion. They want us to pay them
$30,000 so they can pay us what they
owe. Their confession that they can
not pay the debt Is an alarming no
tice, to the shareholders to Investigate
tha,condition of the company."
In support of the allegation that the
Du Pont Company is doing business in
this State' without . having compiled
with the law regarding the filing of
articles of incorporation, the Peyton
affidavit read yesterday cites that the
company has' acquired a majority of
the stock, of the California Powder
Works, 3000 of the Peyton Company's

as "vacation month," there have not
been any regular drills in the ar
mories, but such will be resumed dur
ing the early part or January.
There Is a rumor to the eftect that
a short time after the First Infantry
Is under command of its new colonel
an attempt will be made to have the
four companies composing: the First
Battalion of Artillery, originally a
part of the First Infantry, return and
again make it a twelve-company or
ganization.
A picked crew from the batteries
in the Ellis-street armory is having
frequent drills with a new gatling gun
and the men are becoming quite pro
ficient In the work of handling and
serving the piece.
The military ball given at the Page t
street armory last Friday night by
Company B, First Regiment of In
fantry, under the auspices of a com
mittee composed of H. A. Evens, F. C.
Bordenave, W. Keenan. E. D. Stur
ges, O. A. Marshall. S. P. Russell. R.
E. Mlttlestadt, C. Sheehan and E. Ro
chat, with Captain TV. N. Kelly, First
Lieutenant John O'Keefe and Second
Lieutenant Alexander McCulloch as
honorary members, was well attended.
The hall was decorated patriotically
with the American colors in profusion,
corps flags and military emblems. The
order of dances included twelve num
bers with three extras, waltz, deux
temps and schottische. C. Sheehan
was the floor manager, with W. Kee
nan as assistant. The officers and
members of the company appeared in
the new uniforms recently issued.
Last week Colonel Wilhelm, inspec
tor of rifle practice on the staff of the
commander in chief, in company of
Captains Dlxon and Houts of the Fifth
Infantry, visited a rifle range site on
the Meecham tract, between Petaluma
and Santa Rosa, to be used by Com
pany C of Petaluma and Company E
of Santa Rosa, both of the Fifth.
There were present a number of men
interested in the National Guard. The
tract is reached by the electric line
between the two cities named. Colonel
Wilhelm declared that it is not only
admirably suited for two. three and
five hundred yard ranges, but can be
used for greater distances and for a
skirmish range. He declared it to be
one of thÂ« best ranges in the State.
The rifle Inspector, accompanied by
Colonel Hayes of the Fifth Infantry
and Colonel-elect Filmer of the First,
together with a .number j of members
of both regiments, visited Glen Park,
in this city and county, with a view
to ascertaining If It can be used as a
rifle range for the San Francisco or
ganizations and some of those of the
Fifth Infantry located In nearby
cities. It was considered suitable for
the purpose and will be recommended.
The owner of the premises agreed to
arrange it' so as to meet all require
ments and he will charge but a nomi
nal rent for the same. ,
There will be three elections during
January. Major Haven will preside in
Company H of the Fifth in Napa at

GEDDES TAKES
A BOLD STAND
Noted 'Scotch Builder Gives
.... .. x
His Views. on the Proper
Development of Cities
HEALTHIER CONDITIONS
Says to Beautify '.a Town It
Is Not Necessary to" De
stroy the Old Buildings
LONDON, Dec." 17.â Although the
major part of it Is devoted to sn*ow
ingr-, how the ancient Scotch burg of
Dunfermline may be beautified and
rendered /a center of culture and. pro
gress, the aid of Andrew Carnegrle'e
generous donation to his native town,
Professor* Patrick Ge'ddes* report on
"City Development," recently : issued,
possesses far more than local Interest.
As Carnegie explained in placing the
money at the disposal of the Punterm*
line trustees, his purpose was an ex
perimental and general one.: "The
very problem you have to solve," he
said, '"is â What can be done In towns
for the benefit of the masses "By money
in the hands of the most public
spirited citizens?" It is an undertak
ing which appeals strongly â  to those
patriotic residents of American cities
who are striving to prevent the sac
rifice of so much that makes life worth
living In big towns to sky-scrapers and
commercialism. A builder, an anti
quary, a garden-maker and botanist,
a man who has traveled far and ob
served much in both the old world
and the new, and a leader In the
science of social civics, Professor
Geddes is well qualified for the work.
"The world," he says, "Is now rapidly
entering upon a new era of civic devel
opment, one in which progress is no
longer described as in mere quantity of
wealth and Increase of population, but
Is seen to depend onÂ» the quality of
these. The last generation has had to
carry out great works of prime neces
sity, as of water supply, sanitation and
the like. Elementary education, too,
has been begun, so that to some, even
pioneers of their day, our city develop
ment may seem well-nigh complete.
But a new phase of city development
has become urgentâ that of insuring
healthier conditions, of providing hap
pier and nobler ones."
He takes a bold stand against those
who urge that to beautify an existing
town one must first destroy much of it.
"Instead of that merely antiquarian
respect of the scanty survivals of the
past, which is too often confined to the
particular century or period which hap
pens to seem romantic to us, I would
respect and preserve examples of the
honest and characteristic work of each
and every period, whether from our
present, point of view (also a passing
one) it seems to me beautiful or not.
For even if hot available In Its present
form for immediate use, I have once
and again found buildings too hastily
despaired of by others to be capable of
cleansing and repair, or of alteration
and incorporation with such new build
ings as may be required â in short, of
renewed usefulness and even beauty."
He attributes his success in various
works of Improvement which have
been carried out in Edinburgh under
his supervision In the last eighteen
years to the application of this prin
ciple. "Old buildings," he writes,
"first admired, in picturesque dljapi
datldrf' by the toTh-lsT*C"o"r antiquary,
then ruthlessly condemned as out of
date by the utilitarian, or unwhole
some by the Town Councilor, were of
ten found' capable of handling from a
point which harmonized the partial
truth of all these standpoints. Start
ing with the hyglenist, ' uncleanness
has first to be got rid of. Yet this not
necessarily by destruction. Decaying
matter and smells, the germs which
produce these,, are not in the stones
of the buildings, but are in the or
ganic dirt superficial to these. Cleanse
and disinfect in this way and the old
building may become wholesomer
than the average nineteenth century
one, with its imperfect drainage and
other defects. After cleansing and
mending, the antique building is
frankly adapted to its modern uses,
with sanitation, electric light and all.
and though in this process a shock is
sometinÂ»es given to the merely roman
tic spirit, an ultimately truer and bet
ter artistic result is * reached, espe
cially when, with, use and weathering,
the new elements have harmonized
into the old."
A striking example of this recovery/
and preservation of the picturesque '
was afforded by the treatment of a
garden entrance In old Edinburgh.
When Professor Geddes took hold of
it it was an eyesoreâ an unsightly
blank wall with a little door in it. By 1
the lowering and balustradlng of this I
retaining wall the staircase, before hid- 1
den, was pleasingly revealed, and the,
provision of railing and shrubbery com- 1
pleted the transformation. The removal '
of the unsightly and the preservation
of the picturesque and antique â with!
artistic additions where necessaryâ is i
most happily shown in Professor Ged
des' scheme for the improvement of
old . Monastery street, Dunfermline.
Professor Geddes even ventures to I
criticize adversely the work done by
the great Haussman In remodeling
Paris and substituting broad boule
vards for its labyrinthine streets.
"Viewed from the street," he says, "the
apparent -;; advantage in directness of
communication, in access of . light and
air, Beems obvious and unquestionable,
but a more Intimate acquaintance with
the city and Its people from within re
veals the fact that despite the modern
rise of wealth the average Parisian
household has actually less living room
in the new "tenements than before â¢ in
the old, and this at far greater cost for
rent and taxes.
"The decline both In number and
quality of population, which has at
length so deeply impressed the mind
of, France 1 and ?of the world, is now
seen to have been In "â¢ no small meas
ure accelerated by, these costly im
provements.;. Moreover, with fuller
knowledge L of .the city and 'its health
statistics / one sees that the broader
streets, .the ; superficial spaciousness,*
are dearly purchased by the loss of
the ample courts, the old gardens
which lay ..unseen within. For .; to
have to . play in the dusty air of the
street is one main factor In tne weak
ness of town children."'
o The conclusion he reaches "on this
point is of peculiar interest to Ameri
can municipalities, where the substi
tution of new build ings for old in
crowded â  sections is constantly urged.
"The moral of all this," . he writes,
"Is , a very simple one, yet not fully
adopted r into â  the f policy of â â¢â¢ any imV
proving city, that to lessen dirt, over
crowding" and the rest we should ; not
merely relieve our feelings and im

JUDGES DESIRE
BETTER INCOME
Lawyers Join Movement to
/tress Measure Before
the Coming Legislature
, With duties more arduous than those
that fall to the lot of the Judges in
the rural counties, and subjected to the
higher cost of a metropolitan living,
some of San Francisco's Superior
Judges have determined to make an
other effort to have the Legislature in
crease their salaries. Judge Graham
Is said to have Inaugurated the pres
ent movement which was advanced on
Friday by a meeting of legislators, law
yers and Judges In Judge Kerrigan's
chambers. Among those present were:
Representatives Anthony and Tread
well, Senator Lukens of Alameda, for
mer Judge Charles W. Slack, Attorneys
Matt Sullivan. J. J. Barrett; C. S.
Wheeler and W. S. Goodfellow.
Judge Murasky made a talk favoring
the Increase, calling attention to the
outside counties, which are N paying
$4000 a year to the men on the bench,
while the Judges of San Francisco, Ala
meda and Los Angeles counties are do
ing much more work and obliged to pay
more for their living.
It was thought that the Superior
Judges should receive a little less than
the Supreme Judges, but that the raise
need not apply to all of the counties.
'The San Francisco members could start
the bill In the Legislature and other
counties that approved of It could join.
A thorough canvass will be made to find
supporters among the lawmakers and
members of the bar and another meet
ing will shortly be called.
Before the last session Judges Kerri
gan, Murasky, Seawell and Lawlor
fathered a movement for a raise of
salaries, but the effort was not guided
through the legislative shoals at Sac
ramento. /

British. French, German and Belgian
Makers Join With Trust
In America.
LONDON, Dec. 17.â Confirming the
report of the formation of an Interna
tional sleel rail; pool, a telegram from
Barrow says: ("The agreement, which
t was signed by all the representatives
i of the British, French, German and
| Belgian makers, extends for a period
I of three years and is likely to include
' makers over certain zones.
MLt was felt '. that the European agree

were made, though not so much on the
question of price as on the zones to be
allotted to the European and American
makers, respectively.

practically agreed; on both by the
Continental combine and the United
States <3teel Corporation. It is antici
pated tti*at the new pool will come into

Stocks and Cotton. !
The New York wires of E. P. Hutton & Co.
yesterday said:
STOCKS â ThÂ«re was continued great
strength to tb* securities market in to-day's
short session, the steels being the feature. Good
railroad r.ock* continue to be well bought,
though not aggressively. Just before the close
word cam* from Boston that steels and copper
would be attacked by the Boston speculator
early next week, resulting in a email selling
movement. Regardless of whal copper may do.
wÂ« b-Iieve the steels will be protected vlgor
oualy by interest* here, end we would prefer
to buy rather than to sell these securities on
any sharp dÂ«chnes.
COTTONâ On better cables than looked for
our market opened from 8 to 14 points up.
which was about due. World's movement of
cotton is falling off. There are still people
to-day Â»elllnj cotton short who ware buying I
cotton at 10 cents, and with receipts much
larger but they â  are doing it on the theory j
that the cotton In In the country and by de
rreralng futures they can force it out If it is
there. As <o the amount of cotton held back,
this may bÂ« somewhat emaller than has been
figured on. and should this be true and farm
ers stand by this cotton, no doubt this will
cause holders to hesitate. The movement
from now on must be a. great increase over
last Â»ear to show anywhere near the Govern
ment figure*

Poultry closed the week with live stock
well cleaned up and the market generally had
a steady tone. All indications- point toward
an active market during the early part of this
week, when retailers will be stocking up for

to-morrow. Game was In good request and
although receipts were liberal everything
cleaned up at steady prices. Dressed Turkeys

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
A number of Butter houses cot together yes
terday afternoon and decided to advance the
price of fancy creamery to 25c, the new quo
tation to become effective on Monday. Two
reasons were assigned for this move; first, to
call the San Joaquln Valley product, heretofore
going to Los Angeles, to this market, and
second, to enable holders of storage . stock to
work oft these goods. The market was very
firm all day. and later in the afternoon the
top quotation was obtained as a quotation from
the majority of houses. The market was fully
lc higher In the afternoon than in the fore
noon, and the quotations below represent the
range for ' the whole day.
â¢Cheese Is also showing more firmness, as
not as manj- cheesemakers have left off pro
ducing Butter and gone back to Cheese as
was. expected. Stocks are moderate, but there
is no scarcity.
-Eggs are In good demand and very steady,

cleaned up. 4 â

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The' fruit markt-t continued quiet, trade as a
rule being confined to Hie filling of some small
orders for Immediate requirements. . The . cool
wecther checked trade In Navel Oranges,' which
were In heavy supply. ' and aside from a lim
ited demand for shipment there was very
little doing in that description, the bulk of
the available supplies being poorly colored
and generally unattractive. Grape Fruit was
in limited supply and steady, while Tangerines,
Mandarins and Lemons dragged. Receipts of
Strawberries consisted of 4 chests of Long-'
worths and 22 chests of the large varieties.
The berries were mostly poor and sold slowly
In a peddling way at Irregular rates. The
Apple market was in fair shap<>. with good me

MINES AND FARMS
Gold-Producing District of the 'Mother
Lode Offers Fertile Land to Those
Who Would Grow Fruits or Grain
By Superior Judjrc R. C. Rust.
PERHAPS there Is no county
in California more favored
by nature or more varied in
its resources, than Amador
County.
The situation among the foothills of
the Sierra, where the elevation is
neither too high nor too low, makes
its climate most equable. Its grassy
plains and rich valleys, Cor spring and
winter grazing, and its verdant moun
tain meadow lands for summer make
stock raising an important and profit
able industry.
richer or more productive soil
can be found in our State than the
bottom lands along the Mokelumne
and Cosumnes rivers, where the choic
est fruits, melons, berries and vege
tables of every variety grow in rich
profusion, ready market for which is
found in the cities of Stockton, Sacra
mento and San Francisco, and in the
tewns along the great mother lode;
while carload shipments are made to
the Eastern markets from the ranches
in lone Valley.
. Shenandoah Valley, in the northern
part of the county, yields the finest
grapes and peaches in the market, and
its production in grains and other
cereals is large.
In the higher altitudes the finest
qualities of winter apples and moun
tain potatoes grow in abundance.
About five miles from Jackson and
in the higher foothills the Govern
ment, through the medium of the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley, main
tained a Government experiment sta
tion for twelve or fourteen years, dem
onstrating the fitness of climate and
soil for horticulture and viticulture, as
veil as agriculture, in all its branches.
This experiment station also demon
strated the adaptability of the climate
and soil of this section to the growth
of the olive. A number of the ranch
ers embarked in that industry and are
producing olive oil in quite large quan
tities and of fine quality. This indus
try bids fair to assume gTeat propor
tions in the near future. Less than a
month ago I saw at the residence of
P. F. Allen at Forest Home, in the
northwestern end of the 1 county, navel
oranges and lemons growing and
thriving in the open air, the fruit be
ir.g of fine size and appearance. The
date palms were still too young to
pass judgment upon.
The orchards and vineyards at the
experiment station were grown with
out irrigation and prospered, but, of
course, berries and smaller fruits need
it. and this need can be supplied from
the system of canals and ditches of
the Blue Lakes Water Company, which
take water from Blue Lakes and
Mokelumne River and convey it across
the eastern portion of the upper foot
hills from Clinton on the south to
Plymouth on the north. While this
water supply is now chiefly used for
power and battery purposes at the
mines and mills along the mother lode
and for generating electricity at the
immense electric plant of the Stand
ard Electric Company at Electron, on
the Mokelumne River it can be taken
up again below the plant and used for
irrigation in, the lower or-western side
of the county to great advantage, and
the present flow, of water from the
lakes can be largely increased and
used for irrigation . in the upper ; of
eastern portion of the county.
But as variod and important as
these interests are and as promising
as the future seems to be from this
Ftandpoint Amador County, at the
present time, is classified as a mining
county and one of the most promi
nent in the State. 'â %..
The great mother lode, or more cor
rectly speaking, mineral belt, travers
ing its entire breadth from south to
north, contains the deepest mines and
oldest gold producers in the State.
From south and north through the
county, along this lode the Zeile. Ar
ponaut. Kennedy and Oneida mines
in and near the town of Jarkson:
South Eureka and Central Eureka,
n*ar the town of Sutter Creek; the
Keystone, in the town of Amador
City; the Bunker Hill, near the same
town, and the Fremont Consolidated,
near Drytown. All these mines are
now in active operation and producing.
In addition, there is a large number
of mines not in operation at the pres
ent time whose future is promising and
whi<"h need only capital to develop and
add them to the list of producers.
The Kennedy mine is. I believe, the
deepest gold quartz mine in the United
BtMep. bring: 2*>W fept in dentil. It is
operated through three shafts, al
though the principal operations are
conducted throuph the new perpen
dicular shaft, called the East shaft,
and upon which there is the largest
BU-am hoist in the Â«tate. Adjoining
this shaft the company has erected a
new 100-Ftamp mill, driven by elec
tric power, and supplied with modern
improvements.
The Argonaut, which adjoins the
Kennedy on '*â¢Â«Â» south, is also a rich

mine and excellently equipped with
one of the largest power hoists in- the
State and a fine forty-sta.mp mill. The
mill is not running at present owing
to the closing of the mine for several
years during the litigation widh the
Kennedy that has been decided In fa-,
vftr of the Argonaut. Operations were
resumed about one year ago and rock
I* now being taken out and in a few
months crushing will be resumed.
The famous Zeile, in the town of
Jackson, which has been running stead
ily for thirty-five years. or more, is re
building its hoist and a sixty-stamp
mill operated by electric power. This
also is a splendid mine and one of tne
old properties whose value deep oper
ations have proven. It was closed
down for a term of years until dis
coveries in the 1700 and 1900 foot lev
els of the Kennedy, which it adjoins on
the north, induced a company to re
open it with the results above men
tioned.
The Central Eureka near the town
of Sutter Creek is another of the rich
mines that has improved with depth,
it is well equipped with a steam hoist
and a forty-stamp mill run by elec
tric power.
The famous Keystone at Amador
City xs one of the oldest mines on the
mother lode, having been in operation
steadily for over fifty years. It is
equipped with steam hoists and*a six
ty-stamp mill and several Huntington
mills. It has. a splendid record as a
gold producer. j
The Bunker Hill, near Amador City,
is another mine that was closed down
a number of years and then taken
hold of again, and is now one of the
gold producers, and no longer a ven
ture. â  . -
The same can be sajd of the Fre
mont Consolidated near Drytown, be
ing a consolidation of the Gover and
Fremont mines. This mine is splen
didly equipped and will add another
page to the history of deep quartz
mining in Amador County.
Space will not permit of any men
tioning of many other properties along
the mother lode, some more or less
developed, and others in their virgin
state, but all of which in the future
will add to th wealth and impor
tance of the mining industry in Ama
dor County.
There is a vast expanse of country
lying east of the mother lode, and in
the granite formation that is almost
virgin ground, that contains veins of
quartz earning rich deposits of gold,
and which in my judgment "only, need
judicious handling to prove of great
value. The only mine in this belt of
country that has been thoroughly
prospected is the Defender in the Pio
neer district, above Volcano, which is
yielding handsome returns to its
owners. ,
In addition to the quartz mines in
this region are gravel inines of no
small value, and vast deposits of gran
ite and .marble awaiting the quar
ryman. These hitherto have remained
practically idle, owing to the distance
from the railroad, but this objection
is about to be overcome by the rail
road now being constructed from .he
terminal of the Southern Pacific at
lone, to the towns of j Jackson and
Sutter Creek, and on up the ridges to
the neighborhood rf these deposits by
the lone and Eastern Railroad Com
pany.
I might also mention that in gutter
Creek is located the large foundry
and machine shops of Knight & Co.,
which makes the most of the ma
chinery in use in the mines of this
county, and at the farming town of
lone are the flouring mills of A. Mc-
Call and the lone Creamery owned by
local capital.
These, briefly, are the resources of
Amador County. Its opportunities are
practically unlimited. For here lies
ready to the hand of the seeker of
investment the many and various in
dustries I have set forth. The seeker
after pure air and delightful climate
can find enjoyable homes in the pret
ty foothill towns, of Jackson, the
county seat, Sutter Creek, Amador
City, all on the mother lode, and the
valley town of lone; while those de
siring mountain air and the balmy
breath of the pines can find what
they seek in the higher altitude in
and about the mountain towns of
Volcano, Pine Grove and Olita, whose
inhabitants seldom die. but live on to
that ripe old age when their locks be
come as severed as the lines of the
clouds that hang between the highest
peaks of the Sierra and the heavens
above.
And it is not unreasonable or i im
probable to picture among the oppor
tunities of Amador County in the not
far distant future the rolling plains
that mark the dividing line between
Amador and the other counties of. San
Jcaquin and Sacramento .and join the

REMARKABLE CLAIM MADE

Heirs of Commodore Watkins Assert
Ownership of Property in Phila

PHILADELPHIA", Dec. 17.â Fredr
erick S. Malley of Weston, .W.-.Va., has
retained a lawyer of this city to inves
tigate a remajkable claim against the
Government. Malley says he is one of
a dozen great-great-grandchildren of
Commodore David Watkins, who near
ly a hundred years ago owned, much
property west of the Schuylklll River
in Philadelphia. Upon part of this
property is located the Schuylkill
arsenal. - v o â¢'â¢ p

feurid among the commodore's effects
a paper which proved to be a lease
made out by David Watkins to an Eng
lish land syndicate, which was to make
a formal return of the ground at the
expiration of ninety-nine years. He
believed that this syndicate had in
turn leased the ground to the Gov
ernment, but with, the expressed stipu
lation that it belonged to Watkins and
would have to be returned at the end
of ninety-nine years.
The lease expired last June and Mal
ley says about that time the Govern
ment offered the heirs $16,000,000 in
settlement of the claim of the Watkins
es-tate, but that the offer was declined
because the heirs believed the tract is

bank of Amador County is located here,
and Is the only incorporated bank in the
county.:- It has a capital of $30,000 and
deposits amounting- to over $100,000. The
Jackson Gas Light Company has been in
existence about fifteen years. Altogether
Jackson Is in a thriving condition, and Is
steadily growing. Several buildings are
in process of construction at this writing,
to meet the demand for .dwellings. House
rent is reasonable, a four or five roomed
house commanding $10 per month. -A
plentiful supply of water is furnished by
local water works from $1 to $2 per family
per month. For fire protection there is a
volunteer fire company, two buildings for
the housing of the fire hose and carts and
both connected with an electric fire alarm
system which reaches every part of the
city limits.
The county buildings are the .Court
houee and /Hall of Records; both hand
some brick structures two stories high,
with basement in which the jail is lo
cated. The two buildings cost over $60,000,
and will compare favorably with any pub
lic edifice of like character in any county
of the State of equal population.
The County Hoppital | a located on the
outskirts of the town. It comprises two
brick structures, of recent construction,
and provided with all modern conveni
ences. From tlfty to sixty inmates are

Sutter Creek is the second largest town,
with a population estimated at 1500: It is
charmineiy situated on the banks of Sut
ter Creek, sheltered Dy gently sloping
hills on either side. It is noted for beau
tiful and well-kept homos. In addition to
the ordinary business houses enumerated
for Jackson, and which are in about the
same ratio to population in this and all
other centers . of tiade throughout the
countv, Suttor Creek has one weekly
newspaper, the Amador Record, also a
private bank, conducted by Jackson Den

A PROMINENT FINANCIER
AND PROMOTER
Amador's Lendinjr Exponent of Pro
gress.
" Jackson Dennis is one of the most pro
gressive and influential citizens of Ama
dor County, and It Is due to his untiring
efforts that this section of the State has
been brought into public notice of late.
Mr. Dennis has been a resident of Sutter
Creek for the' last twenty-five years and
during that time he has held numerous
positions of trust and gained the confi
dence of all his fellow citizens.
Mr. Dennis has always been a promi
nent figure in the mining Industries of his
county. He was one of the original pro
moters of the South Eureka mine and
formerly managed the property to the
great satisfaction of the other stockhold
ers. The lone and Eastern Railroad is
another project of Mr. Dennis* thrift and
aggressiveness, he being one of its pro
motors. The manufacturing interests of
butter Creek have also come in for a good
share of Mr. Dennis' attention. He has
taken attractive part In -the, development
and advancement of several such pro
jects.
The residents of Amador Count/ have
always recognized In Mr. Dennis a citi
zen whom they could rely upon to boom
their county and attract men of means
and ability, within their midst. He never
loses a chance to do a good turn for his
community, and It Is due in a large meas
ure to his interests that the mining indus
try has been revived there within the
last few years.

CALIFORNIA ANCHOR FENCE
COMPANY OF STOCKTON.
The protection of the right of way or.
a railroad has grown in Importance each
succeeding year. In order to secure the
best protection along the line of the
lone and Eastern Railroad the company
after thorough investigation, selected the
California Anchor Fence as more nearlv
meeting their requirements than any
other on the market. Mr. Edward Rec
ords, president of the Atlas Construc
tion Company, states "that the selection
of the Anchor Fence was due to its
strength and durability; thaflt required
only half the number of posts of any
other: that -it was most securely anchor
ed, and that the final cost was not more
probably less, than the ordinary type of
barbeff wire fence." The California An
chor Fence Company Is located at Stock
ton. Cal., and has built up a splendid
business, owing to the merit of Its arti
cle. Mr. R. E. Wilholt Is president. Mr.

THE IONE AND EASTERN RAILROAD
A New Standard Gauge Line
Into Amador County.
Impetus Given to the Activities, and
Resources of a Famous
Section of the State.
In tba making of history, railroads have
been a mighty, force toward diminishing
â pace, eliminating the Inconveniences of
travel, reducing the cost of freight and
above all, civilizing:
' In the foothills of Amador County Is
situated the town of lone, a terminus of
the Southern Pacific. From this point the
Iona and Eastern Railroad Company is
building a standard gauge steam railroad
to the towns of Jackson and Amador
City, a distance of twenty miles. This
railroad will serve, the population of thÂ»
tfcree towns above mentioned and will
transport the freight and passengers for
the towns of Sutter Creek, Plymouth.
Volcano, Mokelumne Hill and other points,
and will carry the freight to and from
the great mines of the mother lode, in
cluding the Zeila. Argonaut, Kennedy,
Oneida, South Eureka. Central Eureka.
Wildman. Keystone, Bunker Hill and Fre
mont mines.
The inbound freight will be lumber, oil,
mining machinery, supplies and mer
chandise. The- outgoing- freight will be
ore. sulphurets. tailings, live stock and
later on lumber and marble.
-The business of the company for the
first year after construction Is estimated
as follows: 75,000 barrels of oil. 15,000.000
feet of lumber. 20.000 tons general freight.
| MATERIAL DEPOT OF IONE AND EASTERN RAILROAD.
18,000 tons of concentrates, 20.000 tons of
tailings 60,000 passengers, besides â¢ mall
and express. \ These estimates are based
on the business now existing and carried
on by means of freight wagons and stages
at rates about double those to be charged
by the railroad company.
It is fair to assume that the construc
tion and operation of me railroad will
cause a constant Increase of business and
assure a steadily increasing revenue for
each succeeding year. Competent author
ities state that the earnings per mile of
this road will equal or exceed those of
any steam railroad in the State of Cali
fornia. With the above data as a "work-
Ing force.", the promoters of the road are
sanguine of. the most favorable results to
the citizens of the county and to the in
vestors.
The president of the company is Francis
E. Beck, San Francisco, Cal. The direc
tors are: Francis E. Beck. Henry P.
Hoey. S. C. Scheeline J. F. Burgin. Wil
liam Pardy Sr., G. X. wendling and Jack
son Dennis.
Early in'May of the present year. H. E.
C. Feusier. who knows the Sierras thor
oughly, was engaged a9 chief engineer.
The flr?t preliminary survey was made on
the north side of Sutter Creek. But on ac
count of being unable to secure right of
way, the surveying corps was called In
and nothing further dona till July, when
the County Board of Supervisors granted
a franchise and the right of way by Mar
tell was bought by the company midway
between Jackson and' Sutter Creek, to
which places the line will be extended.
The actual work of construction began
In August by the Atlas Contract and Sup
ply Company, which afterward sublet to
the firm of Kricksnn & Petterson the con
struction of the first section from lone to
Martell.
. Rlsrht of way and terminals havÂ» been
purchased and seventy-eight acrea, at
lone, were bought from the>Paciflc Im
provpment Company for the yard3. depot
and shops.
The grtat part of the grading has been
completed, most of which was rock work
and necessitated the use of large amount
of powder. The three largest trestles
have been built and another Is under con
struction.
The first track laying was done In Sep-
tember, but on December the 8th an en
gine was secured, a track-laying force or
ganized and earnest effort put forth to
complete the road to Ranlett and have
cars running to thi3 point by January.
This alone will materially shorten the
heavy loads over muddy roads to mines
and towns above. It is the opinion of thft-
Chlef Engineer that the construction of
the railroad will.be completed to Martell
by February.
At the present time the construction
force numbers two hundred and three
men and a hundred and fifty-six horses.
There are twenty-eight men and one en
gine engaged in laying track with a bal
last gang following. Thirty-one cars of
steel have been received and all the lum
ber and timbers for the trestles is on tha
ground.
The road opens great possibilities for
the filler of the sotl. The climatic con
ditions are favorable for the culture of
pears prunes, peaches, apples, cherries
and berries. There are openings for
creameries.
Clay beds are found from which ship
ments are made to the potteries around
the bay.
TT^E CONTRACTORS.
Something of the Men Who Con
structed the lone ami Eastern Ry.
The firm of Erickson & Peterson te one
of the oldest and most substantial on the
Pacific Coast. Charles ErUkson, thÂ»
senior member of the firm, has been en
gaged by the Southern Pacific Railroad,
in its various Improvements for the past
sixteen years. Where there was a tun
nel, or grading, or masonry work needed
he has taken his part In the construction
and has built- some of the most difflcul:
sections on the line, such as the Chats
worth Tunnel. 'For some time the firm
has been engaged on the Central Pacific
reconstruction between Ogden, Utah, and
Reno, Nevada. â
Gu? Peterson has been associated with
Mr. Erickson for. a number of years and
superintended the construction of the
Chatsworth Park. Tunnel the longest tun
nel in California. He is thoroughly in
formed in railroad construction. ' II. A.
Brandon, who has been assistant engineer
for the Southern Pacific for the past three
year* on the reconstruction in Nevada
and Utah. Is the engineer for the firm of
Erickson & Peterson.
. The firm has the contract for the con
structlpn of the lone and Eastern Rail
road, from lone to MartelSs, with the pro
viso "for the construction of the exten
sion?.
This firm also has a contract for the
construction of three miles of the cut*
and fills on the south . end of the- Bay
Shore Cut-Off beeinning midway between
McDonald and Visitation Pcint to the
connection with the present constructed
line about two and one-half rr.tles- north
or Sar. Bruno. This work consists of very
heavy rook cutting which will necessitate
months of work with steam shovels, small
locon*otlves for hauling their vara and
considerable grading with teams. After
tills cut-off is built, instead of the -heavy
grades now existing through the Mission,
there will not exceed on the line any
thing over fifteen feet to the mile. To
make plain to tne lay mind, one engine
â¢will be able to do the work of three and
in half the time.
'Several new projects are on foot which
this firm 13 figuring on In this vicinity
and elsewhere, and from the large nlant
that It has. it Is evident that there Is
nothing In the way of railroad construc
tion but what It is capable of handling.

DEVELOPMENT IS EXTENSIVE
IN MINES OF THE NORTH.
Sierra and Shasta Promise
Largely for New 'Year ':
Make Great Spurt in Dredging
Sierra County reports indicate that
there will bje much mining in progress
in the vicinity of Sierra City during
the coming year. The Mountain Mes
senger says that the force at the Sierra
Buttes quartz mine has been increased
to seventy-five men. The Northern
Bell mine will largely be operated.
"Westall, who is the new owner of the
Northern Bell, has also- taken a bond
on the Marguerite mine, an adjoining
property. The Keystone mine is work
ing fortv men. At the Mountain mine
twenty miners are employed.
The Redding Searchlight reports a
great amount of development work in
progress in the Lower Springs district,
Shasta County. Scores of men are de
veloping new properties.
The extensive operations of the White Oak
by the Navajo Company, the showing made at
the Crown Deep and the development at the
Milton, the White Oak extension, have had a
tendency to revive Interest ln'the district, and
from all ' appearances it will speedily "develop
into one of the most populous and productive
gold districts in Shasta County.
The Coif ax . Sentinel I savs that . work
will be resumed at Canada Hill, Placer
County, In the spring, at the Golden
West gravel mine: â¢ .
For the past two and a half years the com
pany has been boring Into the hill, firm In
the hope that the channel would be encoun
tered. It was known that It lay some dis
tance back, but the distance was farther than
at first expected. When the present manager,
C. H.' Armstrong,' 'took hold of affairs last
sprlns. the concern was ln a very bad way.
but by hard work the necessary capital was
raised, and the work pushed ahead. The tun
nel began below the old Incline, and has been
driven to- a distance of 1300 feet. It recently
struck the ancient river bed. ..':.>' â â¢;
BIG DREDGING OPERATIONS.
Some idea of the growth of the gold
dredging industry in the vicinity of
Oroville is afforded by, an article in the
Oroville Register. Some of the leading
facts are given: ., â¢â â V'-V;;
There are twenty-seven dredgers now . at
work, and one new one is being built. These
dredgers require 130 electric horsepower day
and nlrht to run them. When the dredgers
began working here they were run by steam,
and wood had to be hauled long distances In
order to supply the demand. Each dredge re
quired during the twenty-four hours five cords
of 4-foot wood, so that to run the twenty
seven boats now in operation here it would
have taken 135 cords of wood each day.' Kach
boat digs from 1500 to 2500 cubic yards a day,
so that the boats taken together may be esti
mr.ted to average 2lKK> yards a day. This
would be then in f round numbers 54,000 cubic
yards a day. â¢ * '
A man with a pick and shovel can . average
r.bout ten cubic yards a day. It would be
possible then for 200 men moving earth only a
few feet to do as much work in a day as a
dr*t'i(*. If such is the fact,' then it would
take 5400 men to move as much dirt in a day
ac the%dreds:prs move here.
According to the Redding Free Press
dredging for gold on Clear Creek, Shas
ta County, will be continued:
The Detroit and California Mining Company's
dredger on Clear Creek, more familiarly known
ns the Helntz dredger, is to be shut down.
The plant will remain Inactive pending a read
justment of methods of working the ground
and a reorrannatlon of th* company, which 1
Is to take place at once. The suction dredger
that is now being used In to he taken out and
replaced with a bucket dredger. This the com
pany directors are confident, after thorough
trial, will be the better way of working the
company's ground on Clear Creek. J." R. Hays
and I,. W. Partridge, of Detroit, Mich., direc
tors of the corporation, spent several dayn at the
plant the past week, and they In company
with Dr. Helntz left Thursday night for San
Francisco to complete the business of straight
ening up the affairs of the company and ar
ranging for its reorganization and the Installa
tion of the new plant. The company's ground
has been thoroughly examined, but the suc
tion dredger docs not do the work profitably.
XEW MARBLE INDUSTRY.
A new marble industry has been in
stituted in Tuolumne County. Of thl^i

AMERICAN FLAG
WAGGER'S FAD
Yankee in London Is Teach
ing Englishmen Not to
Confuse Banners of Xaiions
LONDON, Dec. 17.â There is an ec
centric American in London "society,
well known in high official circles, who
is quickly earning for himself the title
of "flag-wagger." The ignorance and
lethargy displayed in London with re-*
gard to the meaning of flags, which are
flown over all sorts of buildings, is cer
tainly not now noticed for the first
time, but it has been left to this ener
getic American to rouse the old metroo
olis to a sense of its duty.- Flags which
are wrongly made, and which conse
quently have no meaning, he abhors,
and if he saw a Dutch flag' hauled to
the top of a pole, under the evident im
pression that it was a French, tricolor,
he would not scruple to get out pf'his
carriage and ask the owner if he knew
what he was about.
But what was begun casually is now
becoming his chief business in life, and
he has found a far better vantage
ground for viewing these ill-arranged
banners than when craning his neck
out of the window of a brougham. This
is from the top of a penny omnibus,
and wet mornings or fine he will mount
this plebeian vehicle in order to take
notes, and to see tf the post' card he
sends' to offenders has had the desired
results.' â  ; - â¢ -'{>:â¢â

BRITISH PEER'S
SPLENDID YACHT
Earl Eitzwilliam Is the Own
er of the Largest Private
Pleasure Craft in World
, LONDON, Dec. 17.â Some Americans,
who enjoy a home on the rolling deep
and have the money wherewith to af
ford it, may find it' worth' while to fol
low the example of Earl Fitzwilllam.
This nobleman has just purchased the
Union-Castle liner Harlech Castle, with
the intention '.of 'using her as a yacht.
As she is of 3264 tons, he will- probably
be able, to boast that he has the largest
private yacht in the world.
The vessel did hot cost him anything
like as much as he would "have, had '-to'
pay for a craft of the same size built
to 'order."- There are seven or eight sim
ilar vessels, some much larger, now laid
up*- at l Southampton, having been dis
carded from the x regular service to
make way for bigger and speedier
steamships. For people who like plenty
of room and are content with moderate
speed they, would make '"excellent
yachts, arid their size gives them an
imposing appearance. ;.,
The Most Popular.
- Daily and nightly evidence. is. furnished
that the 'Techau Tavern.' at 113 ..Mason
street is .the most popular- dining and
after-theater resort of San Francisco." Not
only, are "our own: people delighted with
its service,' viands, music arid /manage
ment.* but visitors from far. and near her
ald its many attractions to their' friends
and fellow travelers, with the result that
it has attained a reputation throughout
the .United States. Â«. A factor in its suc
cess is that original dishes and- appetizing
delicacies are being served; so"; that, con
noisseurs are pleased and their delights
in' the good" things in life"' increased, by
something new, temptingly gotten'. up and
served as only the Techau Tavern can.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,: SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1904.
CRIMINAL INJUSTICE IS UNPUNISHED
Officials WhOi Twice- Sent Innocent Man to Jail Gon
'tinue to Enjoy Their Fat Salaries.
- LONDON, Dec. 17. â A report has
Just been issued by the' commission
appointed to find out who was respon
sible for the woeful and. disgraceful
miscarriage of justice in the Beck
case. It is an appalling revelation of
official laxity and stupidity. It shows
that the costly " machinery of the
Home Office, supposed to be especially
devised that the innocent may not suf
fer for the guilty, is in as bad a state
of muddle and inefficiency as that of
the War Office. . â 
There is no suggestion,' however,
that anybody ought to lose his job.
The Government shows no indication
of any intention of giving the sack to
any of the officials whose blundering
incompetence twice led to the convic
tion of an innocent man and to his
imprisonment on the first occasion for
a lone term.
RAILROADED TO JAIL.
It will be remembered that Adolf
Beck was first tried and convicted
IS 96 before Sir Forrest Fulton for
frauds practiced on credulous women
and sentenced to seven years' penal
servitude. It was assumed by the po
lice and the Judge that he was a
criminal named John Smith, who had
been'sentenced for a similar offense In
1S77. Beck could have easily proved
that he was not Smith, since in 1877
he was In South America. But Sir
Forrest Fulton would not permit his
counsel to introduce such proof.
"He was convicted," states the of
ficial report, "on evidence from which
everything that told, <y might be
thought to tell in his favor, was ex
cluded. His case was never tried."
When Sir Forrest Fulton, after
denying Beck every . opportunity . to
prove his innocence sentenced him to
seven years' penal servitude; he held
thÂ«Â» office of common ) sergeant, for
which he was paid $12,500 a year.
When Beck, after serving his sentence,
was again arrested early this year for
crimes committed by the same John
Smith, Sir Forrest Fulton had been
promoted and was filling a $20,000 a
yrar office as City Recorder.- On the
application of Beck's counsel he made
an order postponing the trial that the
prisoner might bring some witnesses
from Sweden. The next day, at the
request of the prosecution, he re
scinded that order.
"The result was," states the report,
"that Beck was not in a position to
raise or prove his defense." Twice, it
is thus shown, Sir Forrest Fulton was
responsible for the miscarriage of jus
tice. He still holds his $20,000 a year
office, â¢â¢ and there . is no indication .that
he will be asked Ho resign' it. :
EXPERTS WARPED EVIDENCE.
/T." H. Gurrin. a handwriting: expert
employed by ,the treasury, declared, let
ters written by Beck and Smith to be
in the same hand. An examination of
fac-similes of Smith's and Beck's hand
writing shows there is hardly any re
semblance between them. Gurrin con
tinues to be employed by the treasury
as a handwriting expert. .
Beck bore only a general resemblance
to Smith. A comparison of the record
of Smith's identification marks in the
possession of the police with Beck's
features would have shown that he was
not Smith. But the Public Prosecutor,
whose zeal . procured . the conviction of
an innoc nt man, appears never to have
consulted this record. . He gets a big
salary, but his neglect will cost him no
more than" the censure implied in the
commission's report. . v .
Â£ BLUXDER REPEATED.
After Beck had been three years in
jail he did ' succeed in satisfying the
Home Office that . he was not Smith.
But it led to no revision of his case.
His petitions were read and pigeon
holed as before.
"The fact is," says the report, "that
if there had been any one Ip the Home^
Office In the chain of subordination up
to the permanent Under. Secretary,
whose legal training had .enabled him
to convey in*a minute the real nature
of the miscarriage, the attention of
that official mupt have been called to
the cure In such a fashion us to com
pel intervention."
When Beck was arrested a second
time as Smith and a second time tried
and convicted, the Home Office never
communicated to the police the fact
that he had proved he was- not Smith.
For these gross blunders no one is
to'be discharged, and the 1 nation will
continue to pay J7S0.OOO a year for the
administration of; a department that
has been 'shown to be criminally ineffi
cient ', . â¢";â¢â -:
FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE
COMPANY A IX)CAL CONCERN
Rapid Grqtrth of a ' Great Financial
Organization That Is Typically
California!!.
It was in 1S62 that William Holdredge
conceived the idea of organizing a fire in
surance company that would be a Cali
fornia concern. Ho put his ideas to a
number of then prominent merchants and
capitalists and in August of 1862 the Fire
man's Fund Insurance Company became a
reality with a capital of $200,000. .
Where thousands .were Invested ' in in
surance in the early sixties millions are
represented now. The last statement of
the Fireman's Fund shows that the com
pany's income is a total of $3,<70,7SF63 for
the year. The losses . paid during that
time were 91.293,668 07 on nre risks and
$311,384 62 on marine risks. The net sur
plus in 1904 is $2,156,118 80. The investments
have been judiciously placed and its as
sets are based on the best of securities.
The officers of the Fireman's Fund are:
William J. Dutton. president; Bernard
Faymonville, vice president; J. B. Devi
son, second vice president; Louis' Weln
mann, secretary; George H. Mendell Jr.,
assistant secretary; R. B. Fabj, general
agent, and F. W. Lougee, treasurer.
Mr. Dutton came to San Francisco in
1855 and Is a son df -Henry Dutton, a
revered pioneer. In 1S67 he first saw serv
ice with the company and from that time
on he rose rapidly.
Mr. Fayntonvllle came to California in
1SÂ«< and settled in Fresno, where he soon
built up what was one of the largest
agencies in the State. He accepted a
position with the Fireman's Fund in 18S1
as special agent and adjuster and his
promotion was made in steady steps from
that on. .
Mr. Levison cast his lot with the Fire
man's Fund In October, 1890. when he left
the old Anglo-Nevada Insurance Com
pany, whose marine business was ab
sorbed by the Fireman's Fund in that
year. ~
Mr. Welnmann first saw service with
the company at Benicia. where he acted
as local agent. In 1900 he was chosen
secretary. In January. 1902. Mr. Mendell
was elected assistant secretary. Mr. FabJ
succeeded Stephen Ives as general agent.
Mr. Lougee was elected treasurer in 1S35.
The general offices of the Fireman'3
Fund in this city are at the southwest
corner of Sansome and California streets.

THE SAN FRANCISCO GAL^V SUNDAY, -DECEMBER IS. 1904^
HOMES THE HOPE
OF THE COUNTRY
Men Will Not Fight for
Boarding Houses, but
for Their Own Koof trees
TENE3IENTS /AEE BAD
Houses Owned by Occupants
A re Made a Possibility
by Modern Association
It was a wise man who said â¢' that no |
man will shoulder a musket for his board
ing-house, though men- will fight for
their homes. Whether a -ru.de shelter
on , the mountainside or a hovel in the
valley a man's home is his castleâ and
this no one 'may invade '; without due
process of law. . - .
When the State is full of homes pros
perity is evident, and for these reasons,^
in part, wise men like Jacob Riis advo-*
cate doing away with tenement houses
and supplying cottages in- their place.
That is the basis of the social settlement
idea in its higher form. ; i
In view of these general truths what a |
wonderful record for the" upbuilding of
things is found when one studies the his
tory of. tlie .Continental Building and Loan
Association, with offices at 301 California
â¢ street San Francisco! It was established
m 1SS9. and since that time it haV helped
people to secure homes 'to, make
a city as large as Stockton. Its subscribed
capital is to-day more^ than seventeen
million dollars, a sum too large for the
mind to comprehend:
The same shrewd business sagacity that
led John Wanamaker to invest in loan as
sociations when a young man should to
day cause every young man to study the
merits of the Continental. The chances
of obtaining a home on equltaole terms
were never brighter than now. The com
pany's paid in capital exceeds three mil
lion and five hundred thousand dollars.
During its existence the company has re
turned to its stockholders over two mil
lion and a half dollars in profits. Its regu
lar monthly income exceeds a quarter of
a million dollars. More than nineteen
hundred of its members have been in
duced and aided to build new homes, and
during the same petiod over sixteen hun
dred members have beon induced to ac
quire homes already built.
An association that does so well for its
stockholders Is certainiy worthy of in
vestigation.
In another jaspeet of the case it is well
to bear in mind that the Continental is a
good invtfclment on general principles. It
pays five per cent per annum on ordinary
deposits^ and, so small a sum as $1 will
enabie you to "open an account that will
prove a blessing if you add to it and let
the company take care of you. On term
deposits of $100 or more the
amounts to six per cent per annum. In
terest begins the day of deposit and is
payable perni-annually.
When President David Starr Jordan re
cently advised the man of twenty to con
serve, an estate for the man of forty "he
must have had in mind some such invest
ment as the Continental offers its mem
bers. The man who really appreciates
the sentiment of John Howard Paine's
song of the human heartâ the deep
yearning â  for a home â should not hesi
tate to address the Continental Build
ing an Loan Association for^ such
particulars as will enlist his ambi
tion and his dollars â the ones he might
otherwise waste â in the righteous and
patriotic cause of securing a place where
he will be free from the evils of tene
ments and at the same time enjoy the
independence of a freeholder in this great
country of homep.
DON CARLOS'
LIFE OF EASE
Claimant to the Crown of
Spain Is Happy and" En
joys Freedom From Care
IS POKTLY. AND JOVIAL
Resides yin a Gaudy Palace

in a Fine Electric Launch
LONDON", Dec. 17,â Don Carlos, the
claimant -to the crown of Spain, really
gets much more enjoyment out of life
than if he were seated on the throne
of J\i3 ancestors., That exile and the
attendant freedom from worry agTee
With him is indicated by his portly per
son, and jovial bearing. If the truth
were known, it probablj^vould be found
that he is very well satisfied with his
present lot. Also that not a few of
the hard-worked^ monarchs of Europe,
who live in a constant state of anxiety,
would gladly change places with him.
He recently returned to Venjee and
is again occupying his palace, which,
with its gondola posts, painted in the
Spanish colors, red and yellow, is a
conspicuous object on the Grand
Canal. He has a beautifuK electric
launch, in which he flits about the
aquatic city with {he royal standard of
Spain fluttering above him. In his
palace he is surrounded by a minia
ture court of devoted adherents, who
treat him with as" much obsequious
deference as if he were a real King.
If he prefers the ease of a speedy
automobile to being jolted in an un
,v/Ieldy state coach there is nobody to
ccmplain, as there was. when poor.Al
funso showed hi3 partiality ,'for the
modern vehicle. Don Carlos, in fact,
seems to have everything that makes
a royal life worth living, with none
of the troubles that rob it of itspleas
ures. Naturally he gives no indica
tion of any ardent desire to endanger
his precious person by heading a revo
lutionary movement in Spain.
A Woman Legislator.
Mrs. Electa M. Egglestpn is the sec
ond woman in Massachusetts to 1 be
nominated for State Representative,
having been chosen by the Prohibition
ists of the First Hampshire District.
The first woman so named was Mrs.
Fanny Clary of Williamsburg. At that
time many outside . the Prohibition
party looked on the matter as a joke,
because they believed that even if she
was elected she could not be enrolled
in the House of Representatives. The
question was referred to the Attorney
General of Massachusetts for a deci
sion, and he ruled that there is noth
ing to prevent a woman becoming a
member of the House of Representa
tives if she wins an election.âPhiladel

KING EDWARD'S NEW FIDUS
Cassel Successor to Lipton
!SIR ERNEST CASSEL, WHO IS REPOR TKP TO HAVE SUCCEEDED SIR THOM
AS LIPTON AS THE INTIMATE OF AND CONFIDENTIAL. ADVISER TO THE
KING OF GREAT BRITAIN.
LONDON, Dec. 17. â All because Sir
Thomas Lipton, rich, good-natured
and generous though he is, lacks some
of the qualities that go to make up
a perfect courderr there Is a J good rea
son for believing that he no longer 1
"stands in" as he used to with King
Edward Vil. Those who are in a po
sition to know declare that the aspir
ant for the America's cup has been
cut out of the position which he held"
for a while of confidential adviser to
Edward VII.
If Sir Thomas had taken his friends'
advice he would have lost no time,
once he was in favor in court. Â«n
marrying some woman of title, who,
with his immense fortune at her back,
would have been able to entertain and
go through the other social paces, for
him in the proper style. However,
Sir Thomas failed to, do this, and so
it was, say the court gossips, : that
some one else got the chance to slip
in' and oust him from his enviable
position.
CALLS HIM "EDWARD."
The man who is credited with hav
ing ousted Sir Thomas in this way
visited the United States recently in
the spick and span person of Sir Ern
est Cassel. Of. course it is known in
a way that this self-made. German
banker of 21 Old Broad street and 48
Grosvenor square is one of King Ed
;ward's intimates as well as being a
great sporting man and worth some
thing like $70,000,000.' : ,"
Sir Ernest Cassel knows more about
King Edward's business affairs^ than
any man in England. He is one ; of
the few persons outside of the. royal
family .who is privileged to address
both. the sovereign and the Prince of
Wales by their Christian names. He
has practically presented Edward; VII
with $2,000,000, and every one at
court knows that the cause of. the
/King's quarrel with " the', late Lord
Salisbury, was the Premier's refusal to
make Sir Ernest a Privy Councilor as
well as a Knight . in return â¢ f or, . his
generosity. As soon ' as ; possible after
the l^te Picmierls retirement the
King gave Sir Ernest this much ' cov^.
eted distinction ; in the "'face of strong
opposition in high quarters, and-. 1 the
financier, recently received -.another
proof of the royal â¢â favor when - the
King stood godfather : to his daugh
ter's Â«baby. â¢
â¢ ENTERTAINS HIS MAJESTY.
The public- here, however, has no
idea how intimate, are the relations
between the King and his subject.. "It
is only now, and the"n that the news
papers announce that '.'Sir Ernest'Cas
sel had the honor . of entertaining his
Majesty: to dinner."' lastf evening in
Grosvenor square," > but ;! that . doesn't
prevent the King from being frequent
ly the millionaire's * guest when â¢ the
fact is riot publicly-mentioned.. â¢ -â 
Since, his 'accession" Edward -VII has
practically abandoned -his. clubs,^but
this doesn't me'anr that; he has â¢ given
up his old, cronies.' 'He.' meets ;. them
at af few .private. houseaV; and -one of
the. chief scenes ibf -such 'meetings? is
the 1 big house j in . Grosvenor â¢ square,
just at the corner., of Â» Carlos place,
where Sir . Ernest Cassel lives in a style
such as . few men \ in ,the United Kingr
dom can afford. . â¢ . ,' â â¢ â  :-, '
i Like every. others rich racing; man, in
this country.'Sir Ernest ; also', has I'a
luxurious establishment at / Newmar
ket; His place there, is called Moul
ton Paddocks, and there the' King is
almost invariably, the' millionaire's
guest while the Newmarket season' is
on. .'â  Â«- â - . .â¢'- - . ,â  r- â¢ â  .'-..;''â â 
HIS PURSE KEPT OPEN.
; Though little attempt is made at
ostentation when the King is ; Sir Ern
est's guest In . a â¢ private way, -the din
ners which the financier'givespubllcly
In the King's honor are 1 absolutely re
gal,' and entertaining his Majesty: costs
Sir. Ernest something -like $100,000 a
year.-. <â â â /'-â .'â  â  . ' ..'- â . ', â¢ . â¢ ,â  ,';.-,â¢â 
/, It is as, his confidential" financial ad
viser, i however, that Sir Ernest comes
into_* closer touch .with vthe. sovereign
than : probably any rbther; private "Indi-
vidual ever did, with the possible ex
.ception of that other millionaire
friend of Edward VII's, the late Baron
de Hirsch. It was said, of course that
Baron de Hirsch paid the then Prince
of Wales' debts and many folk believe
that In this respect., too. Sir Ernest
has taken the late Baron's place, but
this is probably not literally true.! Â«
A satisfactory arrangement, which
he made In connection with his Majes
ty's indebtedness in various quarters,
did, however. ;cost Sir Ernest what
even to him must have been a pretty
penny, for in court circles .it is. said
that, the scheme launched soon after
his Majesty's (accession to settle his
accounts out of savings in the expen
ditures at the various royal palace's
was thought out by Sir Ernest, ' and
that in order to set it going he had
to hand over $1,000,000 out of His own
pocket. , , r: -â¢ \ -
KING NOT WEALTHY.
â¢ It is a safe assumption that if his
Majesty or the Prince of Wales, re
quired immediate financial assistance
Sir Ernest would" be the man they
would turn to. In fact, when an an
nouncement was made recently that
the Prince of Wales was going to start
racing stables at Newmarket many
who ought to know affirmed that Sir
Ernest was at the back of the under
taking. It is, not wholly out of the
question either that the King might
be glad of an "advance" at times, for
contrary to the general notion his
Majesty is not by any means rich. The
wills of sovereigns nre the only ones
that are never made public in this
country, and so the supposition was
natural that Edward VII inherited the
fortune which it" was always declared
Queen Victoria was "saving up for
her poor relatives." As a matter of
fact, however, her eldest son got little
of it. the bulk of the Queen's estate
having gone to Princess Henry of Bat
tenberg, who was always in personal
attendance on Queen Victoria and who
was looked - .upon as her favorite
daughter, f She is said. to be enormous
ly wealthy.' '' - â¢ ,-

JAPANESE ABANDON
THE HOPE OF TAKING

Reason for Destroying
Port Arthur Fleet.
STOESSEL HOLDS dUT
Thousands of Nogi's Dead
Remain Unburied.
Special Dispatch to The GalL
TQKIO, Don. IS, 11 a. m. â The bat
tleship Sevastopol has been success
fully torpedoed ten times. Advices
from Port Arthur say that she is
aground and is evidently completely
disabled.
CHEFU, Dec 17. â Persons who
have Just arrived here from Port Ar
thur assert that the unprecedented
slaughter of Japanese during the tak
ing of 203-Meter Hill has caused the
besiegers to change their tactics. Ap
parently they no longer hope to cap
ture the city by assault. This is be
lieved to be proved by the fact that
their shell fire was concentrated on
the Russian warships in the harbor
until the vessels were sunk.
The refugees maintain that the de
struction of the Retvizan, Pobieda,
Pallada and Peresviet could have been
accomplished at any time within the
last three months had - not Japan
hoped to capture the fortress soon and
thus gain possession of the vessels.
Xow that they- have deliberately de
stroyed the warships it is believed they
have abandoned the hope of early
capture of the city.
Since December 1 two steamships
â¢with provisions and one with ammuni
tion have run the blockade and un
loaded their cargoes at Port Arthur.
Around the city the ground is frozen
hard and the bodies of Japanese who
fell in the storming of 203-Meter Hill
Etill lie unburied, it being next to im
possible to dig graves for them. Thou
sands of frozen corpses strew the ac
clivities of the hill and the neighbor
ing sand dunes.
Commander Mizzeneoff. who was
executive officer of the Russian bat
tleship Poltava until that vessel was
disabled and who on December 15
headed a party of seven Russians who
left Port Arthur in a sail boat and ar
rived here yesterday with dispatches,
said to-night in an interview that
Port Arthur is a desolate and, except
for the firing of guns, a silent place.
"The Russians," said he, "are hus
banding their artillery ammunition,
firing only when the effect will be cer
tain. There are sixteen thousand men
in the line of forts and their periods of
rest are few. All the generals except
General Stoessel live In the forts.
Every building In the whole town is
more or less damaged.
"General Stoessel has put the en
tire population on regular rations suf
ficient to last three mqnths. The am
munition is sufficient to last much
longer. I believe the Japanese will
never take the fortress under present
conditions."
TOKIO, Dec. 17.â A report received
from the headquarters of the Japanese
army besieging Port Arthur says that
the following letters from Lieutenant
General Stoessel to General Nogi
reached headquarters at 8 o'clock on
the evening of December 15:
"I have the honor to inform you that
vour artillery Is bombarding our hos
pitals, which ere plainly distinguished
by Red Cross flags. These insignia are
visible from your artillery positions.
"I request you to prohibit this bom
bardment. I make this request be
cause of high esteem for our brave he
roes, who, after glorious fighting with
your force, lie wounded in our hospitals
unjier the Red Cross. Among these he
rocs are some Japanese wounded.
"I avail myself of this opportunity
to convey to you the assurances of my
fcteh respect."
The second letter said:
"I hereby entrust the bearer, Bara
shoff Langa, huntmaster to the Em
peror of Russia and superintendent of
i he Red Cross, to negotiate with your
Excellency to remove the hospitals out
ride the dangerous zone during the
Itombardirient.
"It is needless to say we have respect
for your right to promote the success
.if ; your operations."
Penciled on the envelope containing
<he letters was the following:
-Barashoff Langa will come to the
s;m: place on the afternoon of Decem
ber 16 to receive your reply."
General Nogi reports that he sent
Major Saito. accompanied by Profes
sor Ariga and an interpreter, to Sall
chiao to deliver the following letter ad
dressed to General Stoessel:
"1 have the honor to assure you that
the Japanese army, respecting human
ity and the treaties since the beginning
of the siege, has never purposely di
rected shells against the buildings or
i essels flying the Red Cross; but the
greater part. of the garrison is invisi
ble from our. gun positions.
"As you know, shells do not always
rÂ«>ach. the place against which they are
directed, and especially,: owing to your
long and brave resistance, the devia
tion of our guns Is becoming- greater
and greaterj so. with the greatest-re
gret, tre are , unable ; to guarantee to
reach the places aimed at.
"I avail myself of i this/ 1 opportunity
to convey to' your Excellency- the - as-
The San Francisco Call.
surances of my highest respect."
The record of the interview between
Barashoff Langa and Major Saito is
as folio we:
Barashoff Langa â The Japanese
army, directs its fire against our build
ings under the Red Cross.
Major Saito â Never.
Barashoff Langa â We request you
not to bombard the whole of the new
town nor the northeastern part of the
old town. ?/J .;
Major Saitoâ We cannot agree abso
lutely to limit the area.
Barashoff Langaâ We will give you
a map showing the positions of the
hospitals and hope you will not bom
bard them.
Major Saito-We will receive the map
supporting your request.
It was arranged that the map was
to be delivered on December 18.

CAMPBELL
PAYS VISIT
TO ZEIGLER
EpÂ«clal Diep*tch to The Call
CHICAGO. Dec. 17. â Joseph Lelter
returned to-day from Zeigler, where,
with his brother-in-law. Major Colin
Campbell, he spent the week inspect
ing his mines and laying plans for
conducting a long and vigorous cam
pa!gn against the strikers.
A recital of the experiences of
Lelter in his little mining camp in
Southern Iilinois contains all the
thrilling embellishments of a tale of
frontier life. When In Zeigler the multi
millionaire, capitalist and mine owner,
brother of Lady Curzon of Kedleston,
and of the prospective bride of the
Earl of Suffolk, lived in a constant
state of siege, with a heavily armed
guard surrounding his domicile and a
brace of revolvers in his pockets,
ready for service at a moment's notice.
The experience of a week's stay at
Zeigler with Leiter was a revelation
to Major Campbell, who said he never
saw anything to equal it and marveled
that such conditions could exist in the
heart of a civilfzed community within
the jurisdiction of the United States.
Leiter said:" -
"It was a great life at Zeigler. At'6
o'clock in the morning I make the
round of the, mine tipples and various
buildings, as well as the homes of the
metL I carry a couple of revolvers in
my- hip pockets and I, may say that. I
am not ; at , all backward about using
them if the occasion requires. The
strikers never molest me, for they
know I am not \ afraid of . them and
that I would shoot to kill the moment
any ' of them' made ; a ; move toward his
hip pocket; â¢ I Â£ am going to run my
mines and break up; that band 'of cut
throats outside if it ; takes me eighteen
months to ; do {M.

which will enable us to strengthen our

MYSTERIOUS
MURDER OF
POLICEMAN
Oakland Is Startled
by Mother
George BrowD, Mounted Pa
trolman, Shot Down
While on Duty.
Assassin Fires in the Dark>nd Then
Escapes, Two of His Three Bul
lets Taking Effect.
OAKLAND, Dec. 1 7. â Another po
liceman was murdered in Oakland to
night when Mounted Officer George
Brown fell a victim to an assassin's
bullet. He was shot, by a highway
man about 7:30 o'clock at" Twenty
sixth street and Broadway. Two bul
lets dropped him in his tracks. He
had dismounted to question a /sus
picious character and had the reins of
his horse over his arm when .he was
ruthlessly killed without an oppor
tunity to defend himself.
Brown had been hurriedly sent out
from the police station to intercept a
robber who had held up M. C. Hursey
of 316 Twenty-second street. He fell in
with a man on Broadway and stopped
him. Then those who were within hear
ing heard three shots fired In rapid suc
cession. Brown staggered away and
was taken into the Providence Hos
pital, which was almost across the way,
but "died without making any state
ment. He lived only, about five minutes
after being put on the operating table.
Brown was" seen., to dismount 'â â  and.
accost a man who was riding. a\ bicycle,
on the - sidewalk without a* lantern and
then crossed over to the other side
of the road to where a man was
standing. Almost immediately after
ward three sharp reports were heard
in quick succession. The murderer
was seen to turn down Twenty-sixth
street and run toward. Telegraph ave
nue. â¢ He was a thick set man of me-'
dium height and wore dark clothes
and had on a soft felt hat.
At the hospital Policeman Brown
was attended by Dr. H. Koford, who
found that but two of the bullets had
found their mark. -One tore through
the muscles of the right shoulder. The
other went through the heart and was
the one that caused his death.
J. McKay of 1059 Clay street saw
Brown as he crossed the road to speak
to the man who took his life, and heard
him exclaim, "God, I am shot." He
saw the man run away, and then
helped people, who had been attracted
by the shots to carry Brown into the
hospital.
M. C. Hursey, the man who was held
up at Twentieth and Harrison streets
and at whose instance Brown was sent
out, made the following statement to
the police: b/'&rr
"I. live at 216 Twenty-second street,
and was walking toward my home on
Twentieth when . I was suddenly ac
costed by a man who held a large pis
tol at my head and told me to throw
up my hands. I put them up, and then
thinking it was a joke started to take
them down, when he said, 'Keep them
up!' He went through my pockets arid
took $1 75. He then commanded me to
go along about my business and not. to
turn around. I did as I was told until
I was several blocks away, when I
went into a store and U telephoned to
the police station. Thls : was;. at 7:15
o'clock."
Brown Is the victim. of some of the
many hard characters attracted - here
during the races. Each recurring sea
son is the occasion for Just such hold
ups and only a year ago. Policeman
Smith was . shot In the same way and
David Kiniry, his murderer, has just
been brought to. this city.
Brown's family .is" prostrated. He
leaves a wife 7 and little child and a
mother. After his "death a nurse
from the hospital was sent to' his
home, which is not far away. Brown's
mother is bereft of her reason and his
wife is hysterical. They were taken
to the Hospital, but after a short time
were removed, and Brown's body was
taken to the Morgue.

respondents. Asquith contended there
was no ground for the Intervention of

abstract opinion on the merits of the

the wife of the .well-known London
publisher, V -T. Fisher V Unwin, .and a.
daughter of *. Richard Cobden, - the
great . apostle of free trade, who did
vastly more than any .other, one man
to bring about. the. repeal of the corn
laws in 184G. ; , .
. -As the daughter, of such a man,
Mrs. Unwin is .naturally strongly op
posed to . Mr. â¢ Chamberlain's propa
ganda for the v taxation of food prod
ucts and a modified form of protec
tion.; Nor is She content with being
a passive opponent; of. the Birming
ham, statesman's policy. In the recent
Parliamentary contest at Horsham, an
electoral district in which Cobden was
bom._and -long; resided, -she â¢ actively
espoused the cause of the Liberal can
didate, Ii R. Erskine, against Viscount
Tumour, who - represented the Con
servative party plus the Chamberlain
policy. .. ., . . . ..'.
;Mrs. Cobden Unwin particularly
busied, herself in- bringing to the polls
old men; who stilP retained vivid rec
ollections of the hunger and hardships
they .endured before. Cobden won his
free trade fight. She got them to tell
their stories "of those gloomy times,
and- cited" them before audiences as
living. witnesses 'of .the evils that might
again 1 : be wrought: .â¢ by a re turn to a
policy of protection.
Lord Tumour was elected, but as
his majority in a Conservative strong
hold was 700 less than the successful
Conservative < candidate .had, received
inthe last election in which the rep
resentation had been contested, Mrs.
Unwin regarded it as a vindication of
Cobdenism rather than a victory . for
a | revival of the, policy which he so
strenuously opposed.
To a work just published, entitled
"The Hungry Forties," which gives
the personal experiences of living sur
vivors of that period of stifled revolt
and semi-starvation.; Mrs. Unwin has
contributed an interesting introduc
tory chapter. It. consists in the main
of .interviews obtained by Mrs. Unwin
with old residents of the neighborhood

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE. Dec. 17. â An ap
palling [railroad disaster was " narrow
ly averted this .morning - about \. 2
o'clock at the -Berg siding, , four -miles
north of this city, , when 7; during *~a
dense fog the" second- section^ of,. the
northbound- Oregon train . crashed into
the first which had -been
stalled by trie^breaking of a; coupling.
That no liv^s were lost was due to; the
,quick application -" of the air ; brakes
by Engineer Hohd,who was in charge
of the. engine \bf the second : section!
When he saw the signal light he was
only a short distance from the stalled
train.
Brakeman Henry Lewis of Sacra
mento.'.who was between "the cars re
pairing* the coupling/;, was knocked
down and his left foot was cut off; by,
one, of the' /wheels. , Barney McLaugh
lin of this 'city was alsoTthrbwndown
and he sustained ,' a- fractured collar
bone. - William Wilkinson of- Portland
and Mrs. ' Robert Delany. ' passengers,
were â  severely bruised. A ; number " of
other passengers were -bruised . and
shaken up when the engine struck the
rear sleeper. .- \
"â â . The first reports gave , rise to the
fear that many lives * had . been lost.
and a special, train, bearing Dr. Ste
venson and a corps of skilled assist
ants was dispatched from Sacramento.
Drs. Powell and Stratum of this city
immediately: left for the scene of the
collision and rendered such aid to the
injured as was necessary. Brakeman
Lewis was taken .to Sacramento.
When the.* trains came together the
rear one- was moving at about ten
iriiles- an. hour, having reduced its
speed from about .thirty- five miles af
ter, seeing, the signal. That the brake
man* who was J sent . back to . flag the
coming train did not go farther was
due" to the denser fog preventing him
from- seeing how far he-had gone. It
is also - 1 reported tha"t he 'stopped to
assist Lewis in making the repairs.
One' end .of the," Pullman car^was
demolished and , the " engine was dam
aged to suclv an extent that it was re
turned to Sacramento/ It required
about i three- hours^ to clear* the track
and the southbound Oregon train had
to be held at Gridley.

ORDER FOR HAY EMPTIES BARNS
Unprecedented Shipment Is TImqM to Be for
the Russians In Manctiuria.
CARGOES ARE READY FOR EXPORT
A secret order for several thousand
tons of hay for export shipment has
been placed with one of the leading
feed firms of the city during the past
l*\v days, and circumstances point to
the Russian Government as the pur
chaser and the frozen fields of war in
Manchuria as the destination. The
mystery of the unprecedented emptying
of barns, the risk of the undertaking
V) elude the Japanese warships now in
absolute mastery of Oriental waters
and the possibilities of complications
with the United States Government â¢ n
the part of the shippers because of the
flagrant contraband character of such
a cargo give an unusual interest to the
exportation.
The utmost care is being exercised to
gmard the facts of the shipment from
the public. There is fear that Unclu
Sam will step in and spoil a dealof ex
cellent profit. The secrecy and tho con
flict of explanations are themselves al
most proof positive that there is some
thing wrong. The only questions ap
pears to be whether it is the Japanese
or the Russian Government that has so
sensationally come into the marktt
w ith an order that was dumfounding -.o
the dealers.
Scott & Magner is the lucky firm. It
is only a few days ago that it began an
almost frantic endeavor to rent hay
presses and to buy feed from its rivals.
Their demands became so great that
inquiry resulted, and reports agree that
the contract is for about 8000 tons.
About 1500 or 2000 tons is to be got off,
probably on the Mongolia, before the
first of the year. The presses have been
running night and day rebaling the
hay into small, doubly-compressed
bales. There are about 100 pounds of
hay in each, and the small size makes
the bale much more convenient for ship
and army train transportation.
FIRM IS INNOCENT.
It Is not believed that Scott & Mag
ner are aware of the destination' of
the fodder. They are as innocent of
any conniving with a nation to violate
the laws of neutrality as is John Hay
himself. A. W. Scott declared yester
day that neither the Mikado nor the
Czar was on his books as a custom
er, nor did he have the slightest idea
that his feed was to reach the mouths
of the horses of the Cossacks. If a
man comes ir.to the market with cash
in hand and wants to buy hay. said
Mr. Scott, no firm would be more eager
for the order than would Scott &â  Mag
ner. He would ask no questions so
long as he got his money, and Mr.
Scttt very reasonably argued that it
would devolve on the purchaser to
evade the arm of the United States
Government, if there is any evading

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER IS, 190i.
"But why is there sucli an unpre
cedented rush of the hay presses and
where is this foreign shipment to go?"
Mr. Scott was asked.
"1 suess you refer to the orders of
the* United States Government for
shipments to Honolulu and the Philip
pine Islands. We are not unusually
busy. You krow there is a lot of hay
shipped from this city by the Govern
ment to its island possessions."
"But the Government is not buying
hay. at the present time, the old con
tract having: expired and the call is
out for a new award next month."
"Well, we are getting ready for any
future orders that the Government may
give us."
"Thtn you are merely preparing
yourselves for the new contract with
the United States Government by buy
ing vast quantities of feed and rebal
ing it with no prospect other than the
chance of being the successful bid
ders?" *
"Well, perhaps we shall get the con
tract."
"But you nrst said the United States
Government was buying this ' large
amount of hay, and now when you ad
mit that it is not giving any orders
at the present time, what can be the
destination of this shipment which you
are to begin ta load on the vessel Mon
day morning?" "; Iv" {';â¢
BEGIN LOADING TO-MORROW.
"How do yon know we are to begin
loading Monday morning? I guess you
know too much about the matter, and
I can't talk to you any further."
The bookkeeper in the office was will
ing to take an oath that there was not
a scratch of ths pen in the books about
the order "for thousands of bales." He
was urgent on this point. Should the
United States officials look into ' the
mystery of the baled hay, therefore,
nothing will be revealed by the books.
But tbe man with the pen behind his
ear made the admission inadvertently
that he helifived "some thousands of
bales were being made ready for ex
"To Manchuria?"
"Haven't the slightest idea,"
The market price for hay is about
$17. but it is thought that Scott & Mag
ner are being paid handsomely for pre
paring the shipment in such quick
time. The rival dealers are all-hold
ing their ears to the ground. Some of
them are getting short stubble out of
their sales to Â£. ! cott & Magner, whose
big barns are too small for the rush

TREE AROUSED
BY PLAYWRIGHT
English Manager Objects to
lienmrk That Nearly All
Plays Are "Tomfoolery"
Fliecial Dispatch to The Call,
LONDON, Dec. 17. â Henry Arthur
Jones said, in response to a toast at
a banquet recently, that the enter
tainment at nine-tenths of the most
fashionable London theaters was rank
tomfoolery. Some of his own failures,
he said, had been due to his effort to
meet the demand for tomfoolery, but
others had been due to the lack of
properly trained actors. Thereupon
Beerbohm Tree, lecturing to the stu
dents of his Academy of Dramatic Art,
observed that "Mr. Jones admitted to
having stooped to> the public to con
quer it. Might he not have tried to
learn how to get the strength to com
mand it?" and went on to imply that
if the good Jones had written better
plays he, would have had fewer fail
ures..
Of course, this reference to failures
joggled the chip bn Jones' shoulder,
and the result was a retort that adds
to the gayety of nations. "There is a
vast dffference, my dear Tree," writes
Jones in a letter which was' evidently
sent round to the newspapers -at th-2
same time, "between complaining of
one's own personal position and com
plaining.of the position that on'e art
occupies in public esteem.
"You and I, my dear Tree, have had
too many failures and too many suc
cesses to set an extreme value â¢ upon
the one or the other. '.
"It I have had an occasional failure,
please oredit me with a little of, the
conspicuous fortitude and philosophy
that you have so often shown on sim
ilar occasions. But, as it happens, dur
ing the past season English playgoers
have given me no opportunity for play
ing the martyr. Facts and figures are
at your service."
CRITICS ARE DISTURBED.
The revival of "The Taming of the
Shrew" by Oscar Asche and his com
pany, most of whom are graduates
from the Benson school, has given rise
to the usual amount of disturbance in
critical minds whenever a daring actor
interprets . Shakespeare for himself
instead of according to the conventions.
The different reading given to the play
by Ada Rehan and John urew has been
held up to Asche until he has evident
ly, become a little nettled and has r call-'
ed attention in an interview to the
fact that, according to Shakespeare's
own stage directions, the play: nearly
approaches rough-and-tumble farce,
and Petruchlo. instead' of being a
fine gentleman .who was playing the
part of a bully, was indeed, a : thick-
Fkinned adventurer "who 1 only wanted
to marry mor.ey, whereas \ Katherine
was more or less a cat, with a reputa-
province whose fields are devastated
b the chief consideration. Scott &
Magner are believed to have scooped
up a small-sized fortune from the
transaction. ,., , .
How.- this firm got the order baf
fies its rivals.. They have lall been thor
oughly canvassed, and it has been
learned that none of them were ap
proached with any proposal for an or
der involving thousands of. tons. The:
ordinary purchaser would drive hard
his bargain by competition and seek
bids from, several firms. But in this
instance a buyer, with identity strict
ly^cone*aled, dropped into the market,,
picked out one firm for his confidence
and his order, not caring for the ad
vantages of rivaling effort to get the"
contract.. â¢ "'..â¢'.
KARMAUKS OF RUSSIAN DEAL; j
This method of selecting- a single
firm for its su pplies and thereby bet- '
ter maintaining the secrecy desired has |
characterized the Russian Govern-!
ment throughout the world during the
present war. Private business houses
act as the ostensible purchasers and
the tricks resorted to by all natlonsin
times of war have been employed to
circumvent the laws of neutrality!' The
Japanese, in their purchases in this
market and elsewhere, have been more
keen to get the lowest prices by asking
for bids from .several" firms. The hay
deal therefore bears the earmarks of a.
Russian transaction. j
"Of course it must be the Russian!
Government that is buying the hay," j
declared Japanese Consul j
"Japan raises plenty of feed herself, I
and I have heard absolutely nothing of 1
my Government's seeking, hay in this j
country. j
"The Russians might expect to land
the hay at Shanghai and ship It on the
Chinese railroad to -the vicinity, .of
Newchwang, where they might try to
get around the Japanese forces over
land by team. Itmay also be their, in
tention to get a vessel through to
Vladivostok, where the two ice-break
ers may'be able to make entry of the
port possible. , I presume the Russian
cavalry is very much in need of hay
for the winter. The crops of the
country are probably inadequate, and
of course there is no grazing whei;e
the ground is frozen."
The Consul smiled as he contem-'
plated any plan on trie part of the
Russians to send a shipful of contra
band into the seas' of -the. Fur East.
"Probably they hope to* get the fealtic
fleet there in time to convoy the ship
through the swarm of Japanese war
ships that are now hunting for-some
thlnu to do," chuckled Uyeno.

are starving the chance may be worth

GERMAN* ACTORS STRIKE.
"â â 'No little surprise has been occasioned
by the announcement of the withdrawal
of Herr Arthur Schnitzler's new play,
the "House of Delorme," before the
first performance of it had been given
at the Little Theater in Berlin. Before
the rehearsals were at an end the com
pany struck and refused to perform the
parts assigned lo them in the drama.
They did this on the ground that it was
immoral. Actors and actresses as a
class are not popularly credited with
being more squeamish than the theater
going public on this but in this
particular instance it was their own
profession that was discredited. The
principal incidents of the piece take
place in the house of a famous opera
singer, who under the eyes of her
mother carries on half a dozen in
trigues simultaneously. On the ground
that vice wears such a hideous mien
that it needs only to be seen to be
hated the author declared it a highly
moral play. But the company didn't
see.it 'hat way.
The recent matinee performance for
the benefit of Mrs. Edmund Phelps has
called public attention to the melan
choly fate of that once popular actress,
who at C7, after fifty years of hard and
conscientious work on the stage, found
herself reduced to actual want. She
made her debut at Portsmouth and
ei^ht years later obtained her first
London engagement under the man
agement! of her famous father-in-law,
Samuel Phelps. No breath of scandal
was ever raised against her. She
played her part well both in public and
private life, and it was to pay a trib
ute to an honorable no less than tp a
distinguished career that several of
the most distinguished members of her
profession rallied to her support. It is
pleasant to Toe able to record that the
benefit procured, her a substantial sum.

EXPOUNDS THE .THEORY- '
'OF CHRISTIAN
Bickncll Young Chicago* Interests
' . a Large Audience at ' the - -
AUiambra Theater.;*. ,--,1? *j
The Alhambra Theater was crowded
to the limit of the law last evening by
an audience anxious to hear the theory
of . Christian Science expounded, by
BIcknell Young of Chicago! one of the
many lecturers now touring the land
on behalf of the sect, if such it may be
called. The lecture was under the aus
pices of the First Church of Christ. Sci
entist, and though Mr. Young did not
prove an orator, his straightforward
manner of delivery 'held attention
throughout. Mr. Young was introduced
by Dr. Eleanor Le Blond, first reader
of the First Church. In part he said:
' "Christian Science may be denned as
the science of all that relates to God,
and Is science not only in relation to
healing, but as corrective in relation to
all problems of existence. Accepted
theories of religion and science have
scoffed at' the association of these
words, but reason and logic show con
clusively that science must relate to
truth, and therefore to God, since God
is the cause and basis of all that is
true.
â¢ "Christian Science does not proclaim
a new God or a new law, but comes
declaring the same God and the same
law that Jesus declared, the one infi
nite eternal- God, who is good, and his
good and unchangeable law. Christian
Science declares the; omnipotence, om
niscience and omnipresence of ; God, as
do all other denominations, and upon
that basis shows that .evil, has no
power, knowledge or presence; in other
words, {hat It is unreal." '.'
"Christian Science never ascribes evil
to God or makes him in any way re
sponsible for it, but' shows j that evil
originates in a belief, of material exist
ence entirely apart from God, and'un
supported by science or truth. Of all
people, Christian Scientists ' believe
most absolutely In Christ. T^hey accept
the teachings of Christ Jesus without
reservation. They declare that his
command to heal the sick is as binding
as that to preach the gospel, and that
there Is no evidence that it was intend
ed for his time only. It 'was ''scientific
religion that healed the sick rh the time:
of Jesus and his disciples, and it does
the same work now, and must always
do it, since his life and work were an
example for all time, and his method
was a universal and imperishable her
itage of man."

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Dec. -17. â Sirs.
Chadwlck was arraigned before Judge
Wing of the United States District
Court this â¢ afternoon, .pleaded not
guilty to every charge brought against
her, declined to give bail and was re
manded to Jail to await trial. ' Presi
dent Beckwith and Cashier Spear of
the Citizens' National Bank of Ober
lin, Ohio, were arraigned at the same
time and were allowed to depart after
giving bonds, each for the amount of
$25,000, an increase of $15,000 over
the value of the bond they had pre
viously given.
Few persons were : about the jail
when Mrs. Chadwick â  entered the car
riage Uo be "taken to. the -courtroom.
She walked feebly and was supported
at every step.";- â¢ â '-; '
As soon. as Mrs. Chadwick had taken
her- seat District . Attorney > Sullivan
called the other, two^ defendants' to the
front of the -courtroom.' 'He then
stated to the court the â¦ nature of the
ca$e against the three defendants.
Dawley, rising, said:
"Your Honor, we plead not guilty to
all of the charges."
BANKERS ENTER PLEA.
There was a pause and nobody
spoke either for Beckwith or Spear.
"I understand that Mrs. Chadwick
pleads not guilty," said Judge' Wing,
"but is that the plea of the 'other de
fendants ?"
Beck and Spear hastily exclaimed:
"We plead not guilty."
"I would like to have your Honor fix
the amount of bail to be given by the
defendants," said District Attorney
Sullivan.
"Your Honor," said Dawley, "in en
tering a plea of not guilty, I should
like the privilege of withdrawing it
if we should at a later time deem it
advisable to do so. , I have had no op
portunity as yet,to examine this case
and really know very little about it. I
would ask that the court does not fix
the bonds until later. We are making
no application for bail."
"You appear for Mrs. Chadwick
alone?" asked the Judge.
"Yes, sir."
"She is now in custody, is she not?"
"Yes, sir."
"In cases where a prisoner is in
gustody and bail is to-be given," said
the court,' "the. initial moves must
come from the person so held. 'If that
person does not ask for liberty and
prefers to remain in custody there is
no need of fixing any amount of bail."
I, understand .-.that Mrs. Chadwick d;oes
riot wish to give bail and she can re
main in custody."
"That is perfectly satisfactory to the
Government." -said -District Attorney
Sullivan, and the case, so far as Mrs.
Chadwick is concerned, .was ended.
MRS. CHADWICK MYSTIFIED.
It had previously â¢ been arranged
with District Attorney Sullivan that
Beckwith and Sr>ear, who were al
ready under bonds of â¢ $10, 000, 'should
give , an. additional bond of $15,000
each. The bonds were approved and

CARNEGIE
LIBRARY FOR
SAN RAFAEL
Philanthropist Will
Give Bay Town
. $25,000.
E3â¬clal rnsratch to The Can.
T NEW YORK. Dec. 17. â Through
the good offices of Judge William W.
Morrow of the United States Circuit
Court San Rafael Is to have a new
free 'library building at the hands of
Andrew 5 Carnegie. The amount to be
donated by the multi-millionaire is
$25,000. This is about twice the
amountithat Carnegie has donated to
towns the . size of San Rafael. He
makes his gifts according to popula
tion, and San Rafael, as compared
with other towns of that size, would
ordinarily, get only $1^2,500 from the
benevolent Scotchman, but through
Judge Morrow's influence tw,ice that
amount will be given the bay town.
Judge Morrow, as is well' known. Is
a member of the board of trustees
of the Carnegie Scientific Institute to
be erected in Washington, and he has
been in New York, where he met Car
negie at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel at
luncheon.
The board meets in Washington on
Monday and Judge -Morrow wanted to
confer with Carnegie before the meet
ing takes place. After having dis
cussed this matter Judge Morrow took
occasion to compliment Carnegie on
his generosity in providing libraries
for many cities and towns and re
marked casually that San Rafael. CaL,
had not^-et thus been honored.
"How big Is San Rafael?" asked the
Scotchman.
Judge Morrow> informed him.
"Then I will give $12,500," said Car
negie. v: *' : i
"Remember that I live there." sug
gested Judse Morrow.
"I shall not let that fact stand to
the prejudice of San Rafael." said
Carnegie, "and so I will make It $23,
000 out of pure sympathy for San
Rafael people."

a puzzle to Mrs. Chadwick. The af
fair had been so hastily arranged that
she had no previous knowledge of it
and had no. idea of what It meant.
When the JudgV ; left the bench she'
reÂ£uriled to Dawley and asked: i
"What does it. mean? Why was I
brought here?" ,
. . "It was just a formality," replied
Dawley, "and fixes for the time being
your standing before the court. There
is nothing in it. that affects the issue
of the trial one way or the other."
This was. an evident relief to' Mrs.
Chadwick.
On reachlns the jail Mrs. Chadwick
was perceptibly weaker than when she
had started for the court. She hesi
tated at almost every step and sev
eral times seemed to be on the verge
of* collapse.

outwits himself in trying to outwit

In the very fact that they are Nature's

exact work in exactly the same way
that the digestive fluid3 of the utosiach
do because they are composed of ex-
actly the same elements and possess
the same properties. They relieve th-Â»

ENGLISH JURY
FREES HOOLEY
LONDON. Dec. 17. â After three
weeks' trial a jury in the Central
Criminal Court to-day found Ernest
Terah Hooley not guilty and Henry
d. Lawson guilty of obtaining money
under false pretense?. Lawson was
sentenced to a year's imprisonment at
hard labor. Execution of the sen
tence of Lawson was postponed to
l^rmit an appeal to the Crown Cases
Reserved Court. He was admitted to
bail in JSO.OOO.
Hooloy, whose colossal bankruptcy
and the proceedings therefrom were

London May 10 last on the chargl of
conspiracy to defraud. Since - his
bankruptcy Hooley has been connect
ed with various promotions, some of
which led to court proceedings. Law
son, another company promoter, was
taken into custody the same day in
connection with charges against Hool
â ey. - The technical charge against the
prisoners was defrauding A. J. Payne
of $50,000 by selling him shares of
Siberian gol4 mines and other worth
less concerns. Hooley was bailed in
54 0.000 and Lawson's bail was placed
at $30,006.
In 189S Hooley was the biggest
company promoter in Great Britain.
He was a multimillionaire and was
prominently interested in bicycle, land
and meat companies.^ He reached
the pinnacle of his /prominence, in
1896, when. he promoted a tire com
pany, as the result of .which he was

I Uricsol,
the only cure for
Rheumatism.
If you are suffering: from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may ;
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay aside your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San 1 Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Uricsol cures rheumatism in the only
possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-'
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates the
kidneys, liver ..nd bowels and thus
drives them from the system.
Uricsol is harmless, and no injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any
part of your body.

taining recommended diet for rheu-
matics.

Official of the Salt Lake
Temple Tells of Books
That Will Not Be Pro
duced in Washington
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17!â More im- j
portant testimony was brought out to- j
day in the investigation â¢ of protests \
against Senator Reed Smoot than at
any time at the present session of Con
gress. The witnesses were Charles H.j
Jackson, chairman of the Democratic ;
State Committee of Idaho; John Nich- !
olson, chief recorder in the Mormon ;
Temple at Salt Lake City; Charles "W. j
Penrose, editor of the Deseret News ;
and an apostle of the Mormon church;
William Budge, president of the Bear
Lake Stake in Idaho, and Apostle John
Henry Smith of Salt Lake.
Penrose was elected an apostle last
July, and the attorneys for Senator
Smoot admitted that the Senator was
present and participated in the election
of Penrose. Penrose testified that he
was a polygamist, and was known to
have been such at the time he was j
made an apostle. j
The testimony of Jackson and Budge j
related to political affairs in Idaho, the '
former being a prominent .Mormon and j
the latter active in protecting the in- j
terests of the church. The examina- !
tion of Apostle John Henry Smith had :
not been concluded when the commit
tee adjourned till 10 o'clock Monday.
JACKSOX IS RECALLED.
When the investigation was resumed 1
to-day Charles H. Jackson, chairman j
of the Democratic State Committee of i
Idaho, was again called to the stand.
He is the witness who testified yester
day in regard to Mormon interference
in political affairs. The examination
/ollowed similar lines to-day. As an il
lustration of the local church Issue In
the last election, Jackson said, the vote
for Gooding, Republican candidate for j
Governor, ran behind the vote for
Roosevelt in gentile counties and 'ahead '
of Roosevelt in the Mormon counties,
while the vote for Heitf eld. Democratic
candidate for Governor, ran ahead of
Parker in the gentile counties 'and be
hind Parker in the Mormon counties.
The influence of the Mormons was j
shown, said the witness, by the fact
that the Democrats and independents
were unable to get chairmen of political
meetings held in Mormon counties
without the aid of Mormons.
On cross-examination Jackson said
that Apostles Mathias Cowley and John
Henry Smith were among those who
went into Idaho and told the people
that there had been a revelation that
they should vote the Republican ticket.
Questioned by Attorney Van Cott, rep
resenting Senator Smoot, the witness
said he never had heard these apostles
declare that there had been such reve
lations; that it had always been taken
for granted there had been a revelation
when a Mormon apostle appeared in i
Idaho to direct political affairs. Cross
examination drew f rpm the witness
that' he knew only from general repute
of these affairs, and that his statements
made yesterday concerning sugar legis
lation and bounties was based on the
same Information. He asserted, how
ever, that it was well known that the
Mormons had asked the Legislature
to pass the sugar bounty law, and
wanted it for the reason that sugar
manufacture had been hailed as a.Mor
mon institution in Idaho, "and the
Mormons get everything they ask In
Idaho, whether it is a Republican or a
Democratic Legislature," he 'concluded.
Attorney Van Cott produced a table
showing the election returns in Idaho
in 1904, and attempted to prove that if
the vote for Governor in the six
mon counties had been thrown out
Gooding, the ' Republican candidate,
would have received still a plurality of
more than 2000.
DUBOIS SPOILS A COUP.
Jackson, in answer to questions by
Chairman Burrows, told of the passage
of a resolution by the Idaho Legislature
calling a constitutional convention. He
said the resolution created no "com
ment, and, in fact, Its purpose was ig
nored until Senator Dubols had written
a letter calling attention to the fact
that such a convention could repeal the
Idaho tests against polygamy. Jackson
said the resolution had been put
through the Legislature on the advice
of Apostle John Henry Smith.
Asked why the resolution was not
submitted to the people, Jackson said
the Attorney General gave an opinion
declaring the resolution was improperly
passed, and the Secretary of State re
fused to certify the resolution to be
placed on the ballot.
Van Cott asked if the Attorney Gen
eral who rendered the opinion was
not and is not now a : Mormon, , to
which the witness answered In the af
firmative. Van Cott brought out ! the
fact that there were only nine' Mor
mons In the Legislature "which passed
the resolution calling for a constitu
tional convention, but Jackson . added
that members from counties where the
Mormons held" the : balance of power
were under Mormon influence.
PART OF RECORDS. MISSING.
John Nicholson, chief recorder of
the Salt Lake" Temple, was ' recalled
and 'examined in. regard to the mar
riage records he was supposed, to bring
to Washington. He said that the,rec
ords he ' brought \ contained all , of '. the
marriages that .'had been solemnized In
the.temple since' 1893, when the book
was. opened.
"Is the book you have here the only
one in' which . marriages have been re
corded in that ' period ?.'!, Tayler asked.

"I- have no recollection of any

Then the witness explained that
there was another book in which were
recorded the sealings of men . and
women who had been married out
side of the church. He was asked if
there were still other books and re
plied that the various religious pro
cesses each had a book. â¢ Attention
was called by Tayler to the testimony
of August Lundstrom that he had been
sealed to his wife at a ceremony per
formed in the temple and the witness
was asked where the ceremony had
! been recorded. He said it was in an
other book.
More than fifteen minutes was con
sumed by Tayler in a futile effort to
draw from Nicholson the proper name
of * the other book referred to and

brought in response'to the subpena is
sued by. the Senate committee.
. Senator McComas then asked the
witness and likewise ' was unsuccess
ful..
"You are the keeper of this other
book, are you not?" he asked.
"Well, not the particular one."
"But you know where it is?" the
Senator persisted.
' "I suppose I do," was the response.
"Then why did you not bring it?"
"Because I did not want to."
NATURE OF MISSING BOOK.
Nicholson, then gave a long expla
nation of the character of the book,
in an effort to show that the subpena
of the Senate committee could not; be
held "to call for any records except
those of legal marriages, which had
taken place within . the temple.. HÂ«Â»
described the second book as a record
of sealings of people who, having been
married outside, go into the temple to
receive, a blessing. This blessing, he
said, , was in the form of a seal and
such records were not put In the mar
riage book.
Tayler. took charge of the examina
tion again, and bringing out the fact
that the witness believes the records
arestill within .the temple, asked:
"If you were told by President
Smith not to bring the .books, you
would refuse to touch them, .would
you not?"

any children had been born to him by
his plural wife since 1890 he request
ed his questioner to "wait a minute,"
adding: "I have so many I can't re

apostleshlp, Penrose said he was not
present, but was sent for by the first
president and informed of the election.
He said he could not say whether Reed
Smoot was present or not.
Penrose said, in answer to a ques
tion, that he had never heard of any
one making a protest against his elec

lygamist.
"Was it known that you were a
polygamist?" asked Mr. Burrows.
"I did nothing to conceal the fact,
but I never flaunted it," the witness re
plied.
William Budge of Paris, Idaho, testi

What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body in Health and
Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days, when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us our
- dallj' dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall.
â¢ It vras the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all, and,
â¢mind you, this old-fashioned remedy
was not without merit.
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any ef- i
.feet.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial ef-
.fects of sulphur in a palatable, concen-
trated form, so that a single grain is
far more effective than a tablespoonful !
of thÂ« crude sulphur.
In recent years research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur j
for medicinal use is that obtained from j
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold j
in druff stores under the name of Stu-
â¢ art's Calcium Wafers. They are small
â¢ chocolate -coated pellets and contain the
â¢ active medicinal principle of sulphur in
a hijrhly concentrated, effective form.
Ferw people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
" maintaining bodily vigor and health:
sulphur acts directly on the liver and
excretory organs and purifies and en-
.riches the blood by the prompt elimina- ,
' tlcn of waste material.
Our grandmothers . knew this when
" they dosed us with sulphur and mo-
. lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary flow-
ers of ruluhur were often worse than
- the disease, and cannot compare with
the modern concentrated preparations
cf sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers is undoubtedly the best and
â¢ most widely used.
â  â  They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles, and cure
constipation and purify the blood in a
way that often surprises patient and
physician alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilkins while experlment-
â  trig with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from consti-
pation or malaria, I have been sur-
prised at the results obtained from Stu-
art's Calcium "Wafers. In patients suf-
fering from boils and pimples and even
deep-seated carbuncles, I have repeat-
edly, seen them dry up and disappear in
four or five days, leaving the skin clear
and smooth. Although Stuart's Calcium
Wafers is a proprietary article, and
Fold by druggists, and for that reason
tabooed by many physicians, yet I
know of nothing so safe and reliable
for constipation, liver and kidney trou-
bles, and especially in all forms of skin
disease, as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers" will find in Stuart's Calcium
Wafers a far safer, more palatable and
effective preparation.

STOCK MARKET
CLOSES WEAK
Downward Tendency of
Amalgamated Copper Has
Influence on Securities
STEEL EEMAIXS STRONG
Prices Begin to Droop Aft
er the Appearance of the
Statement of the Banks
XEVV YORK, Dec. 17.â The stock
market gave evidence^ of further
strength and growth of confidence to
day, but when Amalgamated Copper
began to run down hill in the final
transactions the whole market
promptly responded, thus demon
strating the influence still held in the
market by that stock and by the oper
ations that have recently centered ln
It. The closing was in consequence
weak, the most conspicuous strength
of the day being shown by the United
States Steel stocks, regarding which
there were many reports current of an
intended resumption of speculative
operations for a rise as well as of large
orders for steel rails and other pro
ducts.
The announcement of the reorgani
zation plan of the United States
Leather Company was the signal of
some heavy selling of those stocks,
which seemed to indicate dissatisfac
tion with the plan on the part of the
stockholder. . The weakness of these
shares had some sentimental effect on
the general list and the advancing ten
dency with which the market opened
was not resumed when support was
offered to the Leather stocks. The
final selling movement left many
stocks below last night. The move
ment was rather narrow throughout,
except in special stocks, for the most
not of first importance.
The $22,000,000 loan contraction
disclosed by the bank statement was
the result of the stock market liquida
tion of the latter part of last week and
the first part of this- week. The nomi
nal change in the cash item was about
as expected. The raising of the sur
plus reserve item by over $5,000,000
to above the figure of the correspond
ing week for two years past need not
be a matter of indifference With gold
exports in progress and the end-year
requirements approaching. But the
extreme ease of the present money
market leads to neglect of the figures
of the bank statement either way. It
was after the appearance of the state
ment that prices began to droop. Ster
ling exchange was strong and rose 25
points. Total sales â¢ of bonds, par
value, $2,030,000.

PALACE HOTEL, SAX
FRANCISCO, CAL.
More Comfortable Than Everâ Steam
Heat in. AH the Rooms.
Always to the front, alive to everything
that will add to the comfort and pleasure
of the guests, the management has, -for
Sfveral months,' been busily engaged iiir
stalling a steam , heating plant in this
wonderful hotel. A radiator will be placed
ln every room and one can choose which
ever kind of heat is wished, as each room
has an open fireplace. Very many prefer
the upen â  fires â do not like . the . dry heat
made by steamâ and thus this. hotel, built
years ago, possesses advantages of which
the houses of modern times cannot boast.
The radiation is suited to the size of the
room, large radiators for the outside
rooms, small ones for the connecting inner
rooms and medium size for r .the rooms
facing on the. open courts.
Many, of the rooms have been refur
nished â new carpets put downâ new baths
supplied here and thereâ and the walls
newly papered and decorated. With the
unusually- large rooms -comrortably fur
nished and steam heated, the famous

orably with the hotels of recent date and
will certainly, as of yore, uphold its title
undisputed." ?' . ~~ ;â¢.'".'â  '

celebrated Paim Cafe, one of the many
noted restaurants in we Palace Hotel;
noted not alone for the quantity of the
quickly served, food but also for the
quality. . .
One important feature in this hotel,
riot noticed in hotels erected at this date,
-is the great space "devoted exclusively to

EGYPT'S DUST
IS EXPLORED

> Excavations They ; 3Iade
CEMETERIES LAID OPEX
Valuable Collections of An
tiquities Are Obtained by
Dr.. .Reisner for State
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Dec. 17.
Announcement was made by the uni
versity authorities to-day that full re
ports have been received of the work
of thi? Egyptian expedition In 1903-04
under the direction of Dr. George A.
Reisner of the university's department
of anthropology. Mrs. Phoebe Hearst
provided funds for^the expenses of the
expedition, which continued the explo
rations of the four years previous. The
results obtained are described as highly
satisfactory, and the expedition is re
garded as a success.
A concession covering one-third of the
field at the great pyramids ofGizeh was
granted the expedition, the other con
cessions being held by the Italian and
German governments. One hundred
and eleven native workmen were set to
clearing the main cemetery on the con
cession, while twenty-four picked men
maide a preliminary excavation of a
small adjacent cemetery, which it was
necessary to cover later with soil re-'
moved from the larger excavation. The
soil, which was removed by means of a
portable railway, was mainly drift
sand, which appeared to have accumu
lated without being disturbed since
soon after the completion of the ceme
tery, at the end of the seventh dynasty,
several thousand years before Christ.
The cemetery consisted of a large
aggregation of mastabas. the pyramid
shaped tombs characteristic of the
early periods of Egyptian civilization.
Through the present excavations, in
conjunction with those previously made
by the expedition at other sites, it is
now possible to trace clearly the devel
opment of the mastaba from pre
dynastic times to the sixth dynasty.
The main cemetery excavated was laid
out in the reign of Cheops, the builder
of the great pyramid, in the fourth dy
nasty, and burials continued to be made
in it until the seventh dynasty.
Among 'the great mass of valuable
material found are six inscribed stelae,
a number of offering stones of the
fourth and fifth dynasties and a num
ber of statues of single persons and
married couples. Among the earliest of
these figures, going back to the reign
of Cheops, Is a white stone head of
Ka-nofer of remarkably fine execution,
two stelae of the Lady Nofer and of
Khufu-nekht, both of these probably
cousins of the King, and a carved and
painted limestone stela. From a period
slightly later is a magnificent painted
limestone group, Sennuw and his wife,
and a seated group in white limestone
of Hotopi and Renpet-nofret.
A finely finished but much decayed
wooden statue was found leaning
against the southern end of a stone
coffin.. A scribe's palette in red and
black ink on white plaster gives a list
of Kings, gods and cities. Of especial
importance are two inscribed and one
painted offering chamber. Excavations
were also made by Drs. Lythgoe_ and
Mace, under the direction of Dr. Reis
ner, at Naga-ed-Der. One cemetery
excavated brought to light Coptic
mummies, dated by means of coins to
the period of Justinian, of the sixth
century after Christ. These are of
scientific importance on account of the
curious method . of wrapping and of
general interest on account of the
finely ornamented embroideries with
which they are surrounded.
Another cemetery at this iocation
is remarkable both for its antiquity,
which goes back many centuries be
fore the time of the cemetery at Gizeh,
being in great part of the period
known as pre-dynastic, and for the re
markable state of preservation of the
objects found, especially of the human
remains. A special study is being
made of these remains, which will fur
nish priceless data i'or the determina
tion of the racial characteristics of the
earliest inhabitants of Egypt, the peo
ple who originated the civilization
which for thousands of years later was
only developed and maintained. ;
Valuable collections of potteries,
flint " knives, beads, ornaments, combs
and other antiquities' were secured
here. The excavations have been con
cluded and the valuable collections ob
tained are being packed for shipment
to the university, where they will form
p'art of the Museum of Anthropology.
Dr. Reisner and Ills assistants are
now at work preparing the results of
their explorations ;for publication.:,; It
is expected that their reports will
occupy several volumes, which will ap
pear in the university's series of pub
lications on Egyptian archaeology.

ADVERTISEMENTS.ADVERTISE>rEXTS,
THE VALUE OF CHARCOAIi.
F=vr People Know How Useful It Is in
Preservins Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal Is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature,
but fe*r realize its value when taken
ir.to the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; It Is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present
Jn the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking', drinking or after eating on-
iftr.s and. other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion; it whitens the
Yeeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the injurious gases which
'collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
.'the poison of -catarrh. *
â¢ All druggists sell charcoal Jn one
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most for the
money Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozen-
ges; they are composed of the finest
powdered Willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics in -tablet' form,
cr rather in the form of large, plea?-
ent tasting lozenges, the charcoal be-
ing mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell In a much improved condi-
tion -of the general health, better com-
plexiou, sweeter breath and purer
â blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but, ou the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I advise
Stuarfs Charcoal Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering â  from gas in stomach
and bowels and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but 25. cents a box at
drug stores and although in some
cense' a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
any of the ordinary charcoal tablets."
WILL WELCOME
PRINCE FUSHIMI
St. Francis Hotel, the Finest
in San Francisco, Prepar
ing for Eeturn of Visitor
. The management of the Hotel St.
Francis, the handsome structure that
"adorns the heart of the city and stands
faeir.g cue of its most beautiful public
.*-iuare.=. is making thorough prepara
n â¢ :is- for the reception of General
Pilnce Fushimi, the Japanese states-
Man and soldier, who is returning from
his visit to Washington. It will be re
â¢"niembÂ«red that the St. Francis domi
cile*, the distinguished visitor during
Ms stay in San Francisco last month,
jiEiI so royally was he treated that the
â Japanese*; residents of the efty have
printed photographic post cards of the
St. Francis and the suite occupied by
.Prince Fushimi for the purpose of
sending them to their friends in Japan.
â¢ The superior facilities offered by the
hotel have made the place the rendez
vous of distinguished mtn and women
in all. walks of life. Here Charles M.
Schwab, the ship and steel trust mag
nate; Jacob SchiSt and a great many
artists, singers and actors, such as
Richard Mansfield, Maude Adams,
Anna. Held. Minnie Maddern Fiske, E.
,3j., Sothern, Ethel Barrymore, Mme.
Sembrich, Mme. Schumann-Heink, Ig
nace Ian Paderewski, John Philip
Eousa and others too numerous to men
tion have made their headquarters.
Th* selection of the Hotel St. Francis
by these world-wide celebrities has
been owing to its fortunate location in
the heart of San Francisco, its unriv
, a!e<3 view of the most beautiful bay in
California and the glimpses it affords
of distant chains of mountains. Its con
struction has been so designed that all
the suites are light and niry and its ln
â¢terior domestic arrangements are un-
Tivaled in the West.
For several month? past the hotel
has been the headquarters of many
conventions that have visited San
Francisco, the magnificent white and
gold' reception hall being the finest on
the Pacinc Coast. In this hall great
fingers have delighted music lovers,
and the musical concerts have become '
a regular feature of the hotel's season. 'â 
What will probably be the greatest
treat music iovers and society of San
Francisco have yet enjoyed will take
place on the 2Sth of this month, when
for the first time Mme. Gadski, the
sweet soprano.. "will be heard, and later
the riantPt. Vladimir do Pachman, and
the farnous barytone, David Bispham.
will co:nc.
Probably one of the greatest attrac
tions the St." 1 Francis affords is the
cozy grill :room,' whore many jolly
theater parties gather after the even
ing's performance. The proximity of
the hotel to the various theaters is
t>f. distinct advantage in this regard
and tho excellent cuisine makes the
visit most enjoyable. Here the careful
supervision of the Maitre de Hotel
\jsmes I.ie.b. for many years connected
*v.ith the Waldorf-Astoria, is in evi-
So great an attraction has the hotel
proved to be that the management has
plans under war for the addition of
u north wing, which will add one-third
lu the capacity of the hostelry.
' Th? management of the hotel, while
fully aware of the â¢ advantages the
hotel possesses Sn itself, have gotten
â  up a- pretty souvenir booklet in red;
r.nd gx>ld showing views of the hotel,
xjolli exterior and interior, and many
"interesting scenes of San Francisco.
This booklet in itself is a thing of art, 1
the* drawings are in wash and teepia
from the brush of F. Methfessel, and
the idea of depicting local scenes Is
novel and shows no less the broad j
pi-lnciples of the hotel management. .'J

Charles Reed Returns to
San Francisco After Ab
sence of Just Fifty Years
WDsS FORTUNE OX TURF
Gains Fame Through Efforts
to Purchase Ormonde, but
Is Outbid by Macdonough
Charles Reed, who has wona fortune
on the turf of America and Europe, is
back in San Francisco after an absence
of just fifty years. He has, been at
the St. Francis Hotel for a week and
is- spending his time, looking over the
great city that has sprung up. since he
left here in '54. However, . he ' is al
ways willing to forego his sightseeing
for an hour to talk of old times,, of
events that have made him. famous
among racing men and. to voice 'bits
from his book of droll philosophy. .
'Tea," he hazarded yesterday, after
announcing that he had nothing to say,
"It is true- that I once sought "to 'add
the great Ormonde to iny racing string.
I -wenf to the Argentine Republic 'to
purchase Ormonde and I bid 5130,000 for
him, but a cable frpm WV O'B. Mac-
Donough of your city here raised the.
bid to "$150,000 and I let the good
horse go. . It is Just as well, however, j
as developments proved, though. I
never look to the .past. â  V- i
"My philosophy â  is that every day
"marks the birth of a, new .world' to me.
I am here with^my wife (she is 65 and.
I am 75 years*of age), and Iwe enjoy :
every day of our lives. We will leave
to-morrow , morning, ..for Los Angeles
and from there we will go to El Paso,
thence to Mexico. From there we will
go to Paris, where they know how to
cook k and eat better . than any. other,
people on the globe. Then we will get,
ready to go to Australia, where we in-,
tend enjoying ourselves. ;
"This- is -a- great city you. have here
now. When I was here, last the city's
landmark was an old adobe house at
Washington and Kearny/" streets. 1
find that the people here are up to New
York in everything. Your hotels arenas
fine as any thing, they have in: the East
and the way the city has grown up in.
general . is marvelous. When!. I, was.
here. last there was no racetrack in the
vicinity. Now . I. see you \ have as, fine
racing courses as there are in America
and I am. glad to see' that this great
sport is progressing'. 'J-i '**'â '
- "I am an optimist regarding racing.
Some complain that men lose their
money at the "track, which is not good,
but I say that when one man loses
his money and becomes despondent (if
he Is a pessimist), another man wins
this money and becomes correspond
ingly optimistic. So you see every thing
is equal and in the end all are happy.
"I came to the mines of this. State,
in '49 and made. a success of my ven-_
ture. Then- I turned .to racing . and
.made a. success of .that. . have .never
had a failure in, my Jife. and v it. is be
cause I turn my back on the reverses
of yesterday and look forward to the
promises of to-morrow.
"I have disposed of all my horses and
do not expect to enter the racing game
again. But no one can tell what may
happen. I cannot tell what may hap
pen to me the next minute, but one
thing Is sure: I have enjoyed my whole
life and hope to enjoy many more
years. I want to live till I reach the
100-year mark: then I want a terrific
case of smallpox to cleanse my system
so I can live sixty years more. , This
is how well I enjoy life, and all" can
do the same if they, but make up their

GOLDEN IS 'A SOLOMON
COME TO JUDGMENT
Justice of the Peace Decides ' Owner-
ship of Dog, Which Kcspontls Only
to Name of "Frit*."
Justice Golden yesterday gave judg
ment in favor of Dr. C. G. Kenyon,
who sued Charles Rietzke tor. JJie, re
turn of a cocker spaniel, -.named
â¢â¢Fritz." or the '. doVs" equivalent in
value â 5100. The testimony disclosed
that Kenyon had lost the dog in Sep
tember and that, he shortly after saw
the dog in Keitzke's possession. Reitz
ke, it appears, 'in 'July, last lost a dog
of the same kind which answered to
the name of "Massie.'V and he testi
fied that he had -paid A J5 % - to a man
named Hoffmann for â¢ its recovery.
Neighbors of one litigant'testified that
the dog belonged to Kenyon, while
others declared that Reitzke was its
owner. ! ..' v
Judge Golden was in a quandary un-,
til he bethought himself of a novel
expedient. Miss Lydla , Daggett. who
was employed f in Dr.- Kenyon's office,
called '"Fritz" to 'the E^'aniel, .which
forthwith gave:e.yery^deh}onstration oÂ£
delight, but when" she called "Massie"
the dog did not respond at all, which
proved conclusively to. Judge Golden
that the dog was Kenyon's. After he
was given Judgment- Kenyon wanted
to assume possession of the dog then
and there" and became much excited
when told that he would have to pro
cure a writ of possession from Sheriff
Curtis before he could take the dog
home. . ,

JIMMY BRITT'S HARD WORK IS NOW OVER
Jimmy Britt took his last punch at
his sparring partners yesterday after
noon out at the ocean beac^h. There
will be no more herd work on the
plumber boy's bill of fare till he works
out against Battling N&lson on Tues
day night. Road stunts and some
light exercise in the gymnasium will
constitute Jimmy's labors during the
next three days.' He realizes it is im
possible for him to improve his condi
tion.
â¢I will be at weight Monday after
noon," said Britt. 'I feel like doing'
more work, but my trainers have ad
vised me to cut it out and I will follow
instructions to the letter. A little road
work to-morrow, Monday and Tuesday
is all I need. If I feel so inclined I can
go into the gym and work the machine
rill I am satisfied.
"Yes, 1 am going to have the same
old bunch behind me in my corner â
"The Spider." Frank Rafael, "Tiv"
Kreling and Curt Richardson. They
are good enough for me. They have
always brought me luck and know'
what I want and I feel everything will
be all right when they are with me. I
am prepared for a long and bitter
fight. My friends have seen me work
and they know quite well that I am
fit."
The crisp, clear weather spurred the
plumber boy on yesterday. He felt
like doing barrels of work, but was not
allowed to go too fast. He had a long
session with the bag and then took on
Frank Rafael for the limit, four
rounds. It was the usual fast pace,
but the plumber boy was ready when
"Tiv" Kreling took hold of him for
their usual session of tugging and
clinching.
The plumber boy weighs 134 pounds
aow and can take off the two extra
ones any time he wishes. He figures
on being to weight on Monday after
noon and then taking a good long
sleep. He will probably wake up on
Tuesday morning about a pound over
the mark, but this will readily come off
en the road. WhÂ«*n he steps on the
scales before the battle he will be well
under the required mark and ready for
the going.
Contrary to expectations. Battling
Nelson donned his gymnasium clothes
yesterday and spent about an hour
going through his usual stunts. It was
programmed for Bat to take things
easily until Sunday, but this afternoon
he becames restless and begged Man
ager Murphy to allow him work.
Murphy finally consented and the
Dane was again happy. Many spec
tators visited the camp yesterday, al
though it was advertised that Bat
would not work until Sunday.
The fair sex were well represented
by the presence of some well known
society ladies. Those present were
Mrs. Miles Baird; her sister, Mrs.
Quarre; Mrs. L. Zewriker and Mrs.
James McCormick.
The ladies held the fort and Bat
and Eddy Santry worked hard to
please them. Bat was sorry he had
not visited the barber shop before
hand, but begged to be excused.
The usual gymnasium work was

to please the ladies, had Bat and San
try go three rounds. They were short,
but fast and furious. In the morn
ing Xelson and Marvin Hart, the
"Southern rebel," took a walk in the
wilds of Tamalpais.
The betting on the Britt-Xelson
fight continues brisk, each having con
siderable . backing. The odds re
mained at 10 to 8 yesterday, with Britt
the public choice, but any large
amount bet on either man would have
changed the odds at once. It is ex
pected the training quarters of the
men will be thronged to-day.
A number of Eastern fight fanciers
like Nelson's chances and are sending
in commissions on him. It is expected
the odds will find their true level on
Monday. The fighters are in grand
condition from all appearances,' so it
is reasonable to suppose the bettors
will get a run for their money, some
thing they did not get in the Britt-
Gans engagement and in the Corbett-
Nelson fight. -*
The sale of seats indicates an un
usually large attendance. From ap
pearances it may reach a total of from
$3r.,000 to $40,000.
TAKES A STAND
ON AMATEURISM
The board of governors of the Pa
cific Athletic Association made merry
around the banquet board last night
the while they discussed the condition
of amateur athletics on this coast.
The guest of honor was William Greer
Harrison, president of the Olympic
Athletic Club.
Mr. Harrison spoke feelingly of
amateur sports, on this coast, taking
for his text "Pure Athletics." He de
plored the fact that commercialism
had entered into athletics to an
alarming extent, not only on this
coast but throughout America. â¢ Few
athletes seem free from the taint. He
said the reason was found in the fact
that athletes were no longer proud of
the bit of ribbon or bronze as a prize.
The guerdon of honor was cast* aside
for the money that was in it. Boxing
has reached a lower point than any
other sport and is in a hopeless con
dition, from which he sees no way to
extricate it. Â».
The speaker praised the proposed
athletic ground in Golden Gate Park,
en which it is hoped to rehabilitate
amateur sports. He said there is some
thing in the sunlight which will help
purify the gymnasium men and show
them where they are following false
idols. He advocated dropping boxing
entirely and to have the so-called ama
teur boxing destroyed. He said he had
nothing against the professional so
long as he fights honestly, but he de
spises the man who poses as an ama
teur and then sells honor and every
thing for a paltry purse. Mr. Harrison
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', SUNDAY, DECEMBER IS, 1904. ~^~â
said there Is a healthier spirit and
more chivalry shown in the outdoor
sports and more joy . In the competi
tion. He Struck the keynote of amateur
sports when he said the chief purpose
of amateur athletics was in the train
ing which a man received, and not in
the prize he won.
The evil In amateur boxing, he said,
was in the corruption of clubs, which
buy the boxers. They are dishonest
when they pose as amateur clubs be
fore the Supervisors when they secure
a permit. He recommended that steps
be taken to stop this so-called ama
teur boxing and said the Olympic Club
would do its share in its suppression.
In Greece, he said, to be an athlete
was to be a gentleman. Now it means
the athlete has something to sell and
the young men nre demoralized. Mr.
Harrison's address was loudly ap
plauded.
President Skaife of the Academic
Athletic League, Herbert Hauser, T.
I. Fitzpatrick, George James and
others made addresses. Among those
present were: President W. B. Hinch
man. Secretary Herbert Hauser, Wil
liam Greer Harrison, J. D. Robertson.
A. P. Rothkopf, T. I. Fitzpatrick.
George James, W. W. Naughton, R.

PADEREWSKI BEGIN
SEASON IN FINE FORM
The gods artistic were the stage
management of the Paderewski recital
yesterday afternoon. Or was it may
hap the ; Olympian accident? But let
us riot look too curiously at the good
provided. This it was, that the Pad
erewski that wandered in wraith-like
to the Alhambra platform yesterday
afternoon, ashen-faced and shadowy 7
eyed, damaged not a jot that lovely
thing of dream and -twilight that
"Paderewski" has spelled for most of
us these six years. Even the corus
cating hair was dimmed into a som
ber nimbus and the hands flashed un
certainly through the gloom. No foot
lights? Of course. But one was well
content to lack them. It is not Pad
erewski's fault that he is as much a
picture as a pianist. Nor is it fault in
us so to admire him. But it happens
that his kind of picture of to-day, ro
bust and sunny, is not his picturesque
ness of yesterday, mysterious and elu
sive. And perhaps one liked one's
Paderewski better that way! There
fore down with the footlights!
A few kingly chords and those of
us responsive were in his grip. It was
not a brilliantly responsive audience
as a whole. For an Alhambra full of
people- â the place was crammed from
stem to' sternâ there was surprisingly
little noise made. And one wonders
why. Perhaps the cold day, the cool
hall. 'One wonders why in face of
possibly the loveliest pianism of the
day. And of the other pianists I am
now forgetting none. Not even Har
old Bauer. .1 did that at the concert
â forgot every | one. Comparisons
while Paderewski' is playing are im
possible. One simply remembers no
one else. And it is not that the Pad
erewski personality intrudes itself be
tween one and the' composer. One
more delicately, jealously, fastidiously
unobtrusive it were impossible to find.
The charm is simply a matter of a
sheer, all-compelling, all-sufficing
beauty.
"The loveliest pianist of the day â "
I think I am not wrong in so calling it.
The readings, the toneâ ah, the tone.
Take the Brahms variations on a Paga
nini theme of yesterday's programme.
Every tonal variation is there. Hear
ing them as Paderewski plays these
variations you subscribe to the impos
sible. The tone is impossibly prismatic.
It pales, flushes, glitters, films into
mist and gossamer, swells Into a titan
volume, thin-edges, dries, roughens â
everything that tone can and cannot
do- and be Paderewski's tone does and
is here. -.And this amid as subtle pian
istic deviltry as you will find! Then
the charity, humor, dignity and sanity
of the reading! Yea, but this is pian
ism, indeed!
The sonata chosen was the Beethoven
"Moonlight." Every one. I think, was
glad to hear this sonata again, now so
out-moded upon programmes as to be
new. Exquisitely voiced was the first
movement; the last brilliantly impas
sioned and dramatic. For me, however.
the peculiar delight. of the reading lay
4n the interpretation of the little alle
gretto â absolute poetry- â 
The Fantasle of Schumann, op.- 17,'
began the . programme. Only after
ward, too, did one remember the Bauer
Schumann! One remembers, too, after
ward, a certain Immaculay of legato
that Bauer hasrwhen he sings his Schu
mann, that perhaps Paderewski has
not in such absolute measure. But â
who thought of that yesterday?
Spiritually one got the very Schumann.
One got eminently the humor of him,
the sometime almost elephantine play
fulness, the smoldering passion, the
shadowed gayety. the caprice, ro
mance, drama. Then there was more
Schumann in the well-known '."Toc
cata," where Paderewski had some
more technical fun ,-with us. But
through it he led, as always, to the
beauty of the thing. It Is only after
ward, * again afterward, that one re
members the 1 technical side of Pad
erewski's art. And when one remem
bers it, one must stop to marvel at the
chords of overwhelming' mass and
power, scales infinitely , fluent, trills
mechanically perfect, double notes â
but where's the use?
One small nocturne, not of much
moment it is to be owned, however
pretty an ingratiating, represented
Paderewski as a composer. It was
very well liked by the audience ap
parently. Then Lizst, with that favor
ite old warhorse, the E Major Polon
aise, closed the programme. It was
lustily encored, the audience seeming
by that time to have aroused to the
situation, and after several futile bows
the pianist complied with the demand
with the "Campanella."
Chopin I have left to the lastâPade
rewski and Chopin. Words fail me, as.
Laura Jean says, when these noble
Poles present themselves together.
Paderewski gave the C sharp minor
scherzo yesterday, that to me seems to
symbolize all Poland, to crystallize
into superbest form the grace, poetry,
passion and fascination of that un
happy race. And so^it was that the
Polish virtuoso played it. It was an
epic. The others of the Chopin group
were the ballade In G minor, magnifi
cently imagined and played; the Pre
lude No. 17, whose reading should for
ever stand as warning to those that so
wickedly caricature the "bell" sugges
tion; three etudes, No. 12, No. 7âen
cored and repeatedâ and the No. 3 (E
major), adorably played. It was not
our fault that this was not encored.
The. beauty of it claimed silence as
homage. Then again, perhaps, we we.re
afraid that Paderewski would give us
another "Turkish Patrol March," wfiich
he appended as encore to the Brahms
"Variations"! That wasn't nice, you
know.

â Â± A 'CIVIL WAR CAPTAIN. . _. .
Talks to the Point.
"Until about two â < years ago I had
had ,piles*for about; thirty -years, at
times bleeding and^ very painful. I got
a fifty-cent box of Pyramid Pile Cure
at 1 the 'drug store, and used it and was
entirely cured: got another box in case
I ; needed it, and as the piles, did not
return in six months I gave the remedy
to 'â  a friend of mine who wanted the
doctor to operate to - cure . him. My
friend said , he would use the 'pyra-
mids,' but he knew they would. do him
no good,' but they,' cured him of piles
of twenty-five years' standing. I am free
from piles to-day, and have been since
using Pyramid Pile Cure. I was Cap-
tain in the Civil War." James Adams,
Soldiers' Home', Cal.
The majority of people labor under
the impression that an operation is
necessary , in severe cases -of piles, or
hemorrhoids, and are very skeptical
regarding the remedial virtues of any
medicinal compound. Testimony like
the' above^ should, certainly have a
tendency. to dispel this impression, al-
though it is odd that such a fallacy
should prevail, and still more odd that
so many people should think an oper-
ation effects a permanent cure, where-
as the contrary is more often the case.
We advise all sufferers from this
painful complaint to buy, a fifty-cent
package of v Pyramid Pile Cure at any
drug store and"try it to-rnight.
Those interested cannot be too
strongly urged to write Pyramid Drug
Co., Marshall, Mich., for their little
book describing the causes and cure of
Piles, as it contains valuable informa-
tion, and is sent free for the asking.

SEYMOUR HEIRS ANSWER
ALLEGATIONS OF WIDOW
Bitter Contest Promised for Estate
Which Is Estimated to Bo Worth
More Than $750,000. N
The allegations of Susan Seymour,
widow of Simon H. Seymour, in her
contest of his will, in which she ques
tioned the soundness of his mind and
the validity of the testament, were all
specifically denied yesterday in the an
swer of Louisa Hemerson, Henrietta
F. Eckhardt . and Edward Hebrock,
some of the heirs, who are represented
by Bishop, Wheeler & Hoefler.
Seymour was found . dead last . June
In a creek near Bartlett Springs. His
widow obtained â  special letters-of ad
ministration upon hla $750,000 estate
and later obtained an allowance of
5600 a month. When the will was pro
duced It was found that Seymour had
only left her the half interest in their
community property, consisting of the
Seymour House in Los Angeles and an
interest in a lot on Mission .street. He
stated in the will that his fortune had
grown from the sale of Oakland prop
erty for $100,000 and lots on Market
street for $100,000, which sums he had
reinvested. This ', part of the . estate
was left to a sister and the children of
a deceased brother and sister.

introduced the following resolution,
which was adopted:
"Resolved, That it is the sense of this
meeting that California, the State,
should be exploited widely in order that
the millions of people now unfamiliar
with its wonderful advantages may be
come informed, believing that the re
pults of the different localities of Cali
fornia will be proportionately greater
by concerted effort than could be
reached by local effort alone."

ADVERTISING T1IE STATE.

the State Publicity Committee, dis
cussed by what measures of pubilicity
the various localities can best serve
their particular interests. He . recom

was adopted:
"Resolved, That the several local de
velopment organizations of the State be
advised that their local interests can be
best served by carefully looking after
new arrivals in the State, and . It Is rec

interview these people on the trains and
that literature regarding different lo
calities be distributed among them, and
that the local organizations make .it
their business to see that all newcomers
receive fair treatment and that unre
liable schemes be discountenanced. It
is also recommended that the local^ or
ganizations keep up civic pride in their
several localities, and by making these
localities more attractive draw new
comers their way. It is further recom
mended that all local organizations of
each county that have not already done
so be urged to appoint representatives
on the County Promotion Committee."
â¢ Secretary W. S. McMahill of the
San Jose Chamber of Commerce dis
cussed the exploitation of California
products and introduced the following

that as attractive packages and uni

other products be called to the mat
ter, and that its importance be im
pressed upon them."
DEVELOPING OUR RESOURCES.
Rufus P. Jennings, executive officer
of the California Promotion Committee,
spoke of California publicity, and said:
â¢'California -publicity is a matter that
deserves the earnest thought of every
man engaged in assisting to develop
the'State. We are all working for the
object â to make California still greater
by more fully developing her resources.
This can be done by increasing the pro
ducing and consuming population. In
order to bring this population and to
exploit our products publicity is re
quiredâconcerted, aggressive publicity.
I am convinced that this business of
advertising California and her products
can be carried on with a greater degree
of success than Is readily comprehend
ed, but it must be done in the right
way, and not by a scattering of ammu
nition. By working together and on
business lines Caiifornians can accom
plish wonders for their State. Let all
pitch in and accomplish these won
ders."
Jennings introduced the following res
olutions, which were adopted:
"Resolved, That the counties commit

COURT GOSSIP
OF STATESMEN
Frank P. s Flint of Los Angeles; and
George .A. Knight of San Francisco,
candidates for the United States Sen
ate, have each engaged rooms for head
quarters on "the second or parlor floor
of the Golden Eagle" Hotel. Senator
Bard has engaged rooms across the
street. In the Capitol Hotel. The rooms
reserved for Mr. Flint were occupied
by the forces of General Barnes during
the prolonged Senatorial contest of
1899. Rooms which Colonel D. M. Bums
used in that campaign have been as
signed} to Mr. Knight.
There is some talk at the â  Palace
court to the. effect that the Legislature
will organize on Monday, January. 2, so
that the balloting for United States
Senator, which must begin on the sec
ond Tuesday . after the ; Legislature or
ganizes, will?. take place on Tuesday,
January 10. jSome of ' the "' statesmen
fancy, that .The Senator will be v elected
on the second 4 ballot In joint conven
tion. If early organization be effected,
so that balloting'may begin on the sec
ond Tuesday of January, the first joint
convention will assemble on Wednes
day, January 11.
The story is going the rounds of the
political camps that many complimen
tary votes for local favorites â  will * be
cast'on the first ballot. It is said,, for
instance, that/A. Ruef will get' eleven
votes in the first - show down. U. S.

ballot in joint convention ; would, ap

NOVEL ANSWER
OF BONDHOLDER
A solution of the divorce problem is |
suggested ' in "\ the novel defense set up
by, Samuel L..Lavinburg to the suit of
Bertha Lavlnburg for divorce. The de
fendant is 74 years old, and it. was only
six years ago that * he married Mrs.
Bertha Giass after being assured that
the matrimonial venture would not in
terfere with"' his title to about. $40,000
worth: of stocks and bonds: Before the
wedding he had the future wife sign an
acknowledgment, that she knew him to
be worth $40,000 and expressing a will
ingness that his fortune should always
remain his personal property, upon
which she would make . no claim. To
make her assurance doubly sure he had
her- sign . another, agreement ttÂ» marry
him on condition that If afterward she
should become; dissatisfied she might
leave him .or. he might leave her, and
she would refrain from suing him for!
maintenance or alimony at any time.
The aged husband declares that he is
willing â¢ to support his wife if she will
return to; him. -He -says he did not
know she was dissatisfied, because she
never comDlained to him, and he de
nies that he compelled her to subsist
on beans, rice, stale bread and rancid
butter.' He says that; he 'is', too '.old to
work and - Is obliged to â¢ live economic
ally on the income '. from his securities.
This income is limited, he declares, be
cause he Is paying > interest on a debt
of 529,000 arid trying to reduce the prin
cipal. In '_ spite ; of, the ante-nuptial
agreements ' Mrs.' Lavlnburg sued, and
Judge Kerrigan has allowed her $25 a
month alimony pending the trial of the
case. ; ; _ _^ ; f V - t . I '
, Emll Coret. ' a scedal policeman, . is
charged by -his; wife, Mary, with nearly
all % the 'â . statutory grounds of divorce,
but- in the suit filed yesterday she only
asks ' for $50 a month for her separate
maintenance. â ; Mrs. â  Coret says that her
husband has . threatened ; her life with a
pistol; that he 'has refused to provide
for, his . two , children, , the youngest of
which is a , babe, of five months, . and
that he has been . guilty of infidelity
with ' a . woman named Jodee. She de
clares that; he 'arid the Jodee woman
h*a ve consplrjed to steal the Coret In
fants and depart.

It Is announced that the first step
toward demolishing the Bishop building
on Market street and the erection of a
fine ten-story office .. structure in its
place will be taken early in the com
ing year. The central location of the
building site and the size and ccst of
the structure that has been planned,
give interest to the project of Herbert
E. Law, the owner of the property.
Next east of the^Xiaw building, which
will be known asthe Monadnock, Is tha
Palace Hotel; to the west is the Ex
aminer building- v The Law building sits
includes an area of 22.800 square feet
and this will be entirely covered by the
Monadnock. The frontage on Market
street is 142:6 feet and there is the
same frontage on Stevenson street, to
which the lot extends. Between the
Palace Hotel and the site Is Annie
street, and this gives an additional
frontage of 160 feet on the east.
For some time Mr. Law entertained
the Idea that he would rebuild the pres
ent Bishop building, improving it large
ly.by the addition of stories, to the end
that he might create another hotel for
Market street. Interest ran high over
the prospect of maintaining two large
adjoining hotels on the city's principal
thoroughfare. ..This, Idea was discussed
in and out of the offices of the 'broker's
of real estate and among others who
were able to estimate the Income that a
new hotel would be likely to yield.
It was finally concluded that an office
structure would pay better than a - ho
tel, also that, in the long run. it would
be more economical to expend a large
sum to provide something entirely mod
ern and up-to-date than it would be to
patch up an old building.
Since this conclusion was arrived at
architects have been drawing plans for
the Monadnock. Mayer & O'Brien, ar
chitects, who supervised the construc
tion of the Rialto and other large
structures, were Intrusted with the lat
est and most important of the Law un
dertakings.
The Monadnock will be fire proof
throughout. In all respects it will be
made efficient as an office structure
and will contain nearly 600 offices. The
Market street front will have only suf
ficient stone work to protect the steel
frame, - the purpose being to get the
benefit of the maximum of light, and
to take advantage of thetadvertlslng
value of Market street.
A central light court, 45x65 feet, will
supplement the light that come3 from
three frontages. This court will be
lined with white enameled brick. Five
passenger elevators and one freight
elevator will serve the upper floors. An
elaborate vestibule' and entrance hall
way will be richly finished in royal red
Numidlan marble and bronze.
. The basement will contain a larg&v
grill room and cafe, to be reached
from the main entrance hall or through
a separate entrance on Annie street.
The grill room will be in the Eliza
bethan stvle. The cafÂ« will be in ma
hogany and marbles.
All the wood work In the building
will be mahogany. The corridors will
be wainscoted with marble. A barber
shop will be placed on the tenth floor.
The confidence that Mr. Law has in
the future of San Franci3co is shown In
his decision to demolish so good a
building \ as the one now standing on
the- site of the "future Monadnock.
The Ulshop building, as - it is. would
pav a larse v income for many years.
The amount of money to ; be invested
in the Monadnock Is riot given put
by Mr. Law or by those who represent
him. The. sum Is very large, probably

BUY IN BEAUTIFUL BERKELEY.
WHY DO I SAY THIS?
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN BERKELEY.
I have lived here for 23 years, and know
how nearly It approaches the Ideal in all the
elements of a residential city.
Its climate la among the best, "neither hot in
cummer . nor cold in winter. The natural lay
cf the lajid affords perfect drainage.
In beauty of situation nothing surpasses
Berkeley. The outlook either upon. the hills
to the cast, or the glorious panorama of bay.
mountains and Golden Gate to ' the^tvest, ' is
lovely leyond description. Berkeley Is the
educational center of the Pacific Coast. Its
schools are maintained at the highest. standard,
and here is located the great University of
California, with nearly 4000 students, and fast
becoming one of the foremost educational ln-
liUtutlcna of the land.
Berkeley's elements of growth are many.
The advantages enumerated above draw to It
in constantly increasing numbers from all over
the. coast those who seek such facilities and
surroundings for their families.
In addition Its nearness to and superior con-
nections with San Francisco, the commercial
heart of the coast, makes Berkeley specially
advantageous for those wishing to engage In
business In San Francisco. Thousands of the
clerks, merchants and professional men of that
city reside in Berkeley, and the numbers. are
increasing at a wonderful rate. Two ferry
. lines connect the two cities, running 5 trains
per hour, and making tha trip within 35 min-
utes. \
Berkeley Is growing now at the rate at about
3000 per year and this growth Is sure to be
augmented. | The university will become larger
and- grander and Its Influence more far reach-
ing. A great metropolitan, population U bound
to settle upon the shores of San Francisco Bay.
The superior transportation facilities now pos-
sessed by Berkeley will be further addea to
and perfected, making It a still more conveni-
ent point of residence. -
To be the finest residential city of the coast
is the certain .'destiny of Berkeley. If you
think cf securing a home, or have money to
Invest, buy In Berkeley. Houses and lots for
sale In all parts of town. REMEMBER, THE

EVERY LAW-ABIDING
AMERICAN CITIZEN
STAND BY YOUR GUNS.
THE LAWS OF THE CITY -â¢'-
OF SAN FRANCISCO
WILL HE ENFORCED.
THE GRAFTERS WILL
TO OUR PATRONS AND THE GENERAL
PUBLIC:
On the 1st of January, 1904. in the San
Francisro daily papers, the public were ac-
quainted of our former year's work relative
to employer and employe. We called special
attention to the lawlessness of many of the
union workmen in California, but more es-
pecially to the obnoxious walking delegate.
We claimed then, as we do now, that all men
have a right to form a union for the benefita
honestly derived from the affiliation of similar
trades coupled with fraternal organizations,
etc., but when labor unionists say that men
cannct work beside them* because they do not
belong to their union they are wrong, funda-
mentally wrong. When they attempt to dic-
tate to employers how they shall run their
buBinerses, force honest business men into
bankruptcy, deny the son of an honest me-
chanic the right to learn a trade, thus prac-
tically making a tramp of him unless he learns
a trade as a convict in San Quentin; force
lews through the Legislature and ordinances
through the munfcipal governments which are
unconstitutional, compel the political parties
and hundreds of fraternal organizations,
through fear, to put a "tamale sign" (the
uiiion label) on their printing; force men to
bt'eome idle and boycott men who will not
Join them, then "they are wrong, radically
wrong. We -still adhere to the above state-
ment.
This year has been the hardest and most
stubbornly contested of our lives. Day and
night we have, with our great force of clerks
and the assistance of Innumerable friends,
fought the moral lepers, the walking delegates,
on behalf of the great majority, who are non-
union men. Mothers and fathers, without num-
ber, have pleaded to us on bended knees and
uplifted hands to God to assist them, on be-
half of their boys, to help open the shop,
whereby they could learn a trade. The honest
v.-crkman. forced to Join unions against his
will, pleaded with us to continue in our -work,
that the shops might be opened and that he
might work by the side of his fellow man
whether he or his fellow man belonged to
labor unions, fraternal organizations, believed
In the same creed or went to the same church.
His desire was and Is now to uphold the con-
stitution of the United States. He knew well
that the welfare of his home depended upon
THE RIGHT OF MAN TO LIVE IS THF.
RIGHT OF MAN TO WORK. With such
pleadings and such support we were determined
t) continue in the great work we had already
started, viz: TO SEE THE SHOPS OPEN.
THAT MAN COULD WORK BY THE SIDE
OF MAN WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE
OF ANY ONE.
We had scarcely started this spring when
the holdups commenced. We will mention one,
viz.: the United Railroads. On May 1 the
United Railroads asked our aid, which was
gladly given. Result: WE WON THE
GREAT VICTORY and the public Is receiv-
ing the benefit thereby.
We saw the public upholding our hand, and
then issued a book, written by Herbert V.
Ready, entitled "THE LABOR PROBLEM."
of which 107,000 copies have been distributed
throughout America, and the demand for them
to-day is as great as on the first day of pub-
lication. The book portrayed by prose, poetry
and cartoons the injustice done to the great
masses in California, especially in San Fran-
cisco. No labor unions or walking delegates
were spared, as we were determined that the
American boy should learn a trade in the city
or town in which he resides and not in the
State prison, where the walking delegate
would rather see him go. The public demand-
ing the OPEN SHOP and supporting us, we
pressed forward with strong, forceful, fair,
plain, explicit, unequivocal determination,
sparing neither time nor expense to accomplish
that end. We foresaw millions of dollars be-
ins driven away from this city, we foresaw
our great city doomed to destruction, we fore-
saw our homes being destroyed, we foresaw
the freedom of our churches passing away,
we foresaw the constitution of the United
Str.tes trampled on and -we foresaw. In the
near future, the reign of anarchy. We could
stand It no longer, and with a stroke of the
pen and the voice that has been ringing, is
now and will continue to ring as long as God
lends us breath, we put our bank account
with our determination, and during the past
year we have spent $10,000 that JUSTICE
SHALL PREVAIL and the RIGHT OF MAN
TO LIVE SHALL BE THE RIGHT OF MAN
TO WORK In the city of San Francisco and
the State of California.
In October of this year our Herbert V.
Ready left his business and. with the assist-
ance of twenty-five OPEN SHOP advocates,
went to the following thirty-eight cities:
Salt Lake, Omaha. Pittsbunr, Allegheny,
Kansas City, Chicago. New York, Brooklyn/
Manhattan. Providence, Syracuse, Lowell,
New Orleans, San Antonio, Denver. St. Jo-
seph. Cincinnati, St. Louis, East St. Louis,
Cleveland, Boston, Toledo, Columbus, Roch-
ester, New Haven, Houston, El Paso. Oteden.
Philadelphia, Erie, Buffalo Portland. Jersey
City, Baltimore, Worcester, Paterson," Mem-
phis, Galveston, seektng the assistance, not
of ons State, but of every State in the Union
which possessed mechanics willing tn come to
California and work in the OPEN SHOP, so
that the future of our great city and State
of California should be proclaimed to th<Â»
world bs a FREE STATB IN A FREE

g__P WANTEDâ MALEâ Contln-s-.
They ar? ready and waiting the call to as-
sist us in tho great work for the coming year,
that evtÂ»ry shop of every trade will be OPEN
for every n<an desiring to apply to the em-
ployer for a chance to sell his labor as he
chooses, for the right of every boy to learn the
trade of his choice.
' To accomplish this 'OPEN SHOP every Em-
ployer should start now to hire none other
than OPEN SHOP men. Why? 'Because the
so-called labor unions are weakening and the
walking delegates are running to cover. The
walking delegates know full well that when
good labor is plentiful, as It is now, and with
the assistance of 89,000 applications from men
of every trade to come to California theÂ»
dare not make a demand for employers to sign
contracts, etc., for the CLOSED SHOP, but
let the employers fall to hire OPEN SHOP
help durlna the next four months and the
labor unions, led by these agitators, will then
present a hold-up contract and will try to
tr,ai> the employers again, as they have done
in the past. Kemerab* that labor on the
1st of May will be in greater demand than
it is to-day.
Our patrons, as well as the general public, '<
can depend upon us and likewise upon the as-
sistance of a newspaper, "THE MESSAGE,"
which our Herbert V. Ready started, devoted
to labor and capital Monday, November 14,
1004. first issue. 150,000 copies; November 21.
second issue, 250,000 copies, the demand being
so great we are still printing more copies.
January 1, 1005, we will issue third edition
or 300,000 copies, and intend to continue to
publish monthly and possibly weekly.
Untold thousands of letters, telegraph, tele- I
phone and personal messages have been and
are still being received irom EMPLOYERS
OF LABOR indorsing unqualifiedly our stand
and reciprocating our sentiments. For same
: wp thank you. But without your assistance
we would have failed. Th e credit belongs not t o
us. but to you. Continue to assist us v ln the
future as you have in the past. You will
j reap an abundant harvest from the good seed
sown.
With your great assistance we have no
fear in sayinjr that ONE YEAR FROM TO-
DAY, OR BEFORE, this city and the entire
State of California will have reverted back
to what God intended and the constitution of
th<Â» United States Insures, THE OPEN SHOP
THE RIGHT OF MAN TO LIVE, THE
RIGHT OF MAN TO WORK.

ONCE IN OUR TIME THERE IS A MAN?
(With apologies to Rudyard Kipling;.)
O ye who hold the hidden strings j
That bring the worklngman to time;
That force him to unlawful things
And ntaln his hands with heinous crime,
Beware! Beware! Time's cycle brings
Rewards most strange. "Tis nature's plan
For. every wrong she finds a man.
Proud In the greatness of your strength.
Blind In the pride that nears a fall, .
Your Influence drags its wearing length
And throws its shadow o'er us all.
Again, beware! 'Tis nature's plan,
For every wronjr she finds a man.
Clothed with a little transient power,
N Borne, on the crest of passing wrong
You bristly strut your little hour
Crushing the weak, fearing the strong.
Icnorant fools'. Since time began,
For every wrong there comes a man.
The man is here. You know the place
Where labor seeks for honest toil, .
Where boycottern their steps retrace.
Where labor .rafters seek to foil
His rushinc trade by evil plan.
No long-sr search; no further scan-
Here is tho. place, here Is the man.

v^ vvm The wtiole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When yon
S>< \ \V^* lose that by draining the system in any manner, my Belt will replace it and cure you.
Mr. Harry U. Jackson, Valleton, Cal., write*: "Although you are a stranger to me, my heart warms toward you as a great benefactor and friend, and I cm mat* t_aa
grateful to you. Already I fÂ«el the vigor of new life in my body; no aches and no pains. I wish you every success in your work."
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon hight to the man who has become discouraged from
useless doctoring. I get such letters every day.
My Belt has & wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy.
Louise King. Commercial Hotel, San Francisco, says: "I take pleasure in. dropping you a few lints to let you know how greatly improved I am sines I got your Belt. Mjr
headaches have left me and I am galnln_ in weight. I feel like a different woman, and ajn very grateful to you for all ths good your Belt has done me."
I make tlie best electrical body appliance in the world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. ]^Iy cures after
everything else has failed are my best arguments.
.. Mr. Roy Burk. McKlttrick. Cal., writes: "Krom the first night I wore the belt I felt new Ufa in every part of my body. Tbe weakness was checked immediately, and I _m
now able to do heavy work without tiring. I am glad I thought of the belt, for in no other way could the money bring me so much pleasure."
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, chest or side, Sciatica in
his hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism', or any ache or pain, and my Belt will pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain.
No pain can exist where my Belt is worn.
Mr. J. L. Baird of Orland, Cal., writes: . "My back is entirely well, and I would not take 11GO for my belt if I could not get another. It U the best thing on earth for a
lame back." . . '
And these "old" men, these men who have burned the candle at both ends â or evep if they haven't â these men who for one reason or another
feel that life has lost its'spice, that they arc getting old too fast, I can make them feel the sparkle and fire of youth again. . \
I'll never forget when Mr. A. Crawford of Pokegama, Oregon, an old man of seventy, wrote to me and said: "When I wrote to you last I
told you to send me a Belt to make an old man young, and you did. I am s-venty years old, and since I have worn the Belt I feel as strong as I
did at thirty-five, and can do as good a day's work as I could at that age." It was two years ago that Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here is
one I just got from him: 4
"In reply to your letter I am glad to say that I am Just as much in favor of your Belt as I ever was. for it has been a remarkable help to me. I am seventy-two years old b-jÂ«
I do not look any more than fifty. Am enjoying perfect health, and will continue to recommend the Belt, as I have been doing right along, as I realize tha: but for it I should have
been dead and buried by this time."
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not cures by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt.
Men and women who had tried their home doctors and every known medicine have come to me and been cured.
â¢v _ â& T * u Ta ? e 7, hl> I 21 Hal * ht gt - San Francisco. Ca!., says: "No words can express my feeling of gratitude to you. When I received your marvelous Belt I was in a very
bad condition physically. I was nervous, -weak, digestion was poor. I couldn't sleep but two or three hours in the night, my mental power was weak thon_h I had be?n nauiral'v
very strong, and all these symptoms were the result of a sexual weakness. Now I am well, and I am glad to have this opportunity to recommend the Br!t to those who suffer from
zuch troubles as mine, for they will be restored to perfect health by_your Belt." . I
Now. what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you ought to be. can you ask any better proof to make you try it? Is there a rem-
edy which Is as simple, as easy to use. as sure to cure and as cheap as Dr. JklcLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must try it. In justice to
yourself, and to those who look to you for their future happiness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not be delayed.
Its as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle glowing heat from it constantly, but no sting, no
burning, as in old-style, belts.
Come and see me- if you can. I have a private consulting room in which I will explain my method of treatment, and, perhaps, give you the names of
some of your friends whom I have cured. â
Send for my beautiful book, full of things a man likes to read if he wants to be a strong man. I send It. sealed, free. If you are a weak woman send
lor my book. Maiden, Wife and Mother," which shows the road to health and happiness for weak woman. Cut out and send this ad.

LONDON, Dec. 17.â There has been
a remarkable spread in the religious
revivals which were started at Boul
ton, Lancashire, on September 6_ of
this year 'by Rev. Reuben A. Tofrey
and Captain Charles Alexander, both
of whom are from Chicago. At the
first the movement was considered to
be only one of the periodical outbursts
which happen throughout England
and Scotland, but the proportions it
now has assumed attracts general at
tention.
Wales, which is largely non-con
formist, is ringing with revivals and
the churches are overcrowded on week

people gather in halls and in the open

such movement has been known in
Wales during the past half century,
but the leaders of the revivals, noting
this fact, point out that similar re

at regular intervals of fifty years and
cite as instances the years 1750, 1800
and 1850. '""*

LOS A.NGELJ23, Dec. 17.â The book
makers had a lively day at Ascot, and
as a consequence cf the success of four
outsiders cleaned up a neat sum. Two
favoritesâ Capitanszo In the second and
fichoharie in the sixthâ were the only
public choices that won. James J. Cor
bett at S, Emperor cf India at 5, Bragg
at 4 and Heather Honey at 10 to 1 were
the others that finished first.
The fourth, a free handicap, at a mile
and a sixteenth, was the feature of the
card. Flo Bob was played heavily and
backed Into favoritism, with Hans
Wagner, Bragg and Elie liked In the
order named. Bragg ran kindly to-day,
roing to the front and never leaving
the result in doubt. Elie had no trouble
beating Flo Bob for the place. Capitan
nzo proved to be a very speedy Bprinter
by winning the second race from Fire
ball in ea5y fashion. There was the
largest Saturday crowd of the. season
present to-day.

LETOLA A STAKE WINNER

Selling Stake in f
a Drive.
FILLY STAGGERS IN
Military Man Runs
Close Second, a
Nose Behind.
BY . FRED E. MUUIOLLAXD.
Before a large half holiday throng
and in a spectacular sort of a rough
and ready finish, one that sent the
cold shivers creeping over the back
ers of the Jennings stable and caused
the teeth to chatter and rattle" like
dice in a pox, Letola earned a nose
decision yesterday at Oakland over
Military Man for the rich Crocker
selling stake, worth $2530 to the win
ner.
Letola carried ninety-three pounds
and was ridden by Frank Sullivan,
while Helgesen pHotod Garnet Fergu
son's colt. The start was not one of
Dick Dwyer's happiest efforts, San
Nicholas getting caught In the bar
rier and being left altogether, but
there can be no doubt that the best
horse won. The winner had ill luck
at the start, too, and besides was
bumped by Byronerdale.
Betting on the race was fast and
furious on the nine starters, the Jen
nings pair, Gold Money and Letola,
ruling favorites at S to 5. Ananias
and Military Man were the next most
fancied, with the long range shooters
plunging away at San Nicholas, El
liott and Romaine.
AXANTAS IX FRONT.
The start was made in front of the
stand and when Dick Dwyer ..released
the barrier Sam Greenfleld, on Anan
ias, was flrst to show clear of the
field. For a quarter of a mile Bull
man had Romaine up second, trailed
by Military Man and Letola. Passing
the half mile pole Sullivan, astride
Letola, made a determined move,
passing Ananias and compelling the
latter to take the poorest going on
the rail. Letola hit the stretch with
a commanding lead and things looked
rosy for the filly until Helgesen
crowded on all sail with Military
Man. He drew up alongside the filly
and the last few yards the .pair In
dulged in a bumping match,. Letola
staggered in first by the narrowest
of margins in 1:40%. Had Greenfleld
taken advantage of the start and wait
ed for nothing the Schorr colt might
have won. He rode to instructions
and finished third. Away badly, El
liott finished fourth. Gold Money ran
a wretched race, displaying no speed
whatever.
Believers in curious figures and
hoodooes did not have a ghost of a
chance of beating the card, as Flying
Torpedo and Head Dance, two of the
winners, were quoted at 13 to 1. Three
favorites attached themselves to
purses. The betting ring presented an
animated appearance, being a veri
table mass of people. The layers
could handle as much money as they
cared to reach out for. '
HONITOX A WINNER.
Honiton, the brown daughter of the
dead Ormonde, captured the six-fur
long handicap from a shifty field,
carrying 116 pounds. It was no pick
up at that, for the mare, after racing
Iridius into subjection, was brought
to a hard drive at the finish, only
beating the two-year-old Squire John
son a neck, the time being 1:13. The
winner" opened an even money chance
in the ring, but Iridius received such
consistent support that - her odds
lengthened to 8 to 5. Iridius weak
ened in the run home, taking show
honors.
A mile and fifty yard selling event,
which opened the afternoon's sport,
went to Scotsman, the 17 to' 10 fa
vorite. Sam Greenfield had the leg up
and it was due to his good work that
the first choice succeeded In beating
Mocorito, less than a length. Fille
d'Or, pounds the best, wa3- brought
from the backwoods by Sullivan, run
ning a close third.
Charley Henshall's two-year-old came
near accomplishing the task set before
him in the five and a half furlong
scramble, for>Il ages. .The Albert colt
Hvas installed , favorite over Mansard,
Tocolaw,: Mlsty's Pride and. that sort,
and s ran ; 'unplaced. \MaVisard, with
Helgesen on his back and 4 to' 1, over
hauled Misty's Pride in- the. stretch, de
feating the Oregon bred mare easily in :
the fast: time o f l:06%\ Davis â¢finished
third with Tocolaw. ' ."; ". ;. _ .'.[
FLYING TORPEDO SCORES. i
It looked as if everybody on the race
track had Little Wallx "doped" to win
the mile an<^ â -three-sixteenths/ selling
fixture, and -at scant, odda. the,Brink
worth entry was. qjunged on. OldlFly
â¢ing Torpedo;had one of his good spells,
and romping out in^ front all' the way
passed the Judges a .neck" before jG. W. ;
Trahern, little Barrett almost tossing'
the race away. The favorite ran third,
beaten two lengths.
At. the distance, seven furlongs.Hool-
Igan looked by far the best of the start
ers in the closing event, for. two-year
olds. He. had first. call In the betting,
but Lloyd Fountain broke it up so bad-,
1>- there was never a chance for his
backers. In a hard drive Kunz on. Head
'Dance downed Sea Air half a length;
The" wlnnW ran practically unbacked. 1

of each particular case; he must '
know to a certainty the remedies necessary, how to give thenvand
when to stop them. His method, hla ways and his- means must
not be of the guessing variety. Now what are the true requisites
for the possession of such knowledge, we answer, A THOROUGH
MEDICAL EDUCATION. DR. JOSLEN'S claim to pre-emlnenco
in the treating and curing of diseases of MEN is based on just that
fact. "AS THOROUGH A MEDICAL. EDUCATION as can be
obtained in the leading colleges of the world." supplemented by
seventeen years of actual experience. His methods of treatment
have been proven correct.The happy results which ho obtains; the
permanence of the cures are being noted By physicians and men
over the whole country. He is making no claims for superiority
that cannot be established by proof that is positive. This proof
is thousands of cured cases scattered all over the Union.
I Treat Varicocele Painlessly and Certainly.
Varicocele affects the veins of the spermatic cord. An average -ot one
man in four suffers from this affliction. The musiruiar walla of thÂ«Â»
' veins weaken and relax, the valves cease to perform their functions and
local stagnation of the blood ensues. The first evidence of vartcocele Is
usually a thickening, dilating, knotting and twisting of thÂ« veins on one
or both sides of the scrotum, most frequently upon the left side, ofteh, â¢
accompanied by pains in the testicles, back, legs, thighs or chfst. and .a
â ense of dragging in the groin. Owing to thÂ« impaired circulation. ' a
wasting away of the testicles, accompanied by partial cr compl-itÂ» loss
of sexual power, almost without exception follow in severe casts where
treatment is neglected, and even slightly developed cases cannot fail to
have a damaging Influence upon the organs involved as well as upen
the general health. . Safety in .all Instances demands a prompt cure,
for varicocele Is a disease that increases in severity the longer i: is
neglected. ,
I guarantee to cure varicocele In one week. . without pain, and with-
out detaining the patient from business. I have cured over two thousand
cases without a single failure or unpleasant result. My treatment Is
original and has been developed through sixteen yean of practical ex-
perience. It restores thÂ«" lost tone and elasticity to thÂ« weakened and
dilated blood vessels, which results in normal circulation and re-estab-
lishes the natural processes of wasto and repair throughout the sexual
systfm. Varicocele is a slow, creeping disease, but it surely and steadi-
ly lowers the standard of vitality, depletes the nervous system aad often
engenders grave Mental Disorders and Paralytic Disturbances. A wide-
open surgical operation Is the onlr remedy adviMd by the musty old
medical text books, to which the majority of physicians adhere. But I
have practically robbed surgery of Its most frightful terrors -by originat-
ing and perfecting a method of my own which positively cures Varico-
cele^wlthout cutting, burning cr tyinx. My patlsnts aw not maimed
or mutilated, nor their powers weakened or destroyed. The parts arÂ»
wholly: preserved. Improvement Is immediate. All pain and dragging
sensations soon disappear entirely. The swollen, sagging, dilated veins
are emptied of their superabundant contents and are rapidly reduced
to "their normal size, strength and soundness. Masculine power is quick-
ly and thoroughly re-established. Every part of the organism affected
by Varicocele is restored to that state of health and soundness Intended
by God and Nature. .

NEW YORK. Dec. 17.â By the burn
ing of the Starin line steamship Glen
Island in Long Island Sound to-day
nine lives were lost and property
rougrbly estimated at a quarter of a
n"\illion dollars was destroyed. That
more lives were not sacrificed was un
doubtedly due to the personal courage
of the officers and crew and the excel
lent discipline maintained when a hor
rible death for all seemed almost a cer
tainty- When the steamer was aband
oned she was flameswept from stern to
etem and yet the only persons who lost
their lives were those whose escape had
been entirely cut off by the flre be
fore the alarm reached them.
Of the thirty-one persons. Including
ten passengers, who sailed away on the
Glen Island last night, twenty-two, in
cluding eight passengers, were brought
back to-day. The dead:

woman, said to have resided at 206

man, Bupposed to be a New Yorker.

Frank Bush, ureman; JÂ«hn Burke, fire
man; Otto L. Alforan, fireman; O Berg,
deckhand; Peter Benson, deckhand.
The Glen Island left her dock last
night for New HsfVen. The trip down
through the Sound was without inci
dent. About midnight when about
three miles west of Greenwich, Cpnn.,
there came a rush of stining smoke
from the hold and every electric light
on board the craft was extinguished.
Captain McAllister sent In the alarm
for fire drill, and the men came tum
bling out of their bunks. In the mean
time the steering gear had been blocked
and the pilots, finding themselves un
able to direct the course of the steam
er, hurried to the assistance of the oth
er members of the crew in saving lives.
Captain McAllister ordered Pilot Mc-
Mullin to go to the hurricane deck and
loosen one of the boats, while he went
to the main deck and tried to loosen
the- two large lifeboats.
LIFEBOATS LAUNCHED.
Captain McAllister managed to loosen
the port lifeboat. The other lifeboat
was frozen to the deck, but a smaller
one was soon. ready to be lowered away.
While the officers and crew were
working there was a scene of confusion
among the ten passengers. They ran
about the saloons In disarray. The
woman who lost her life had been
aroused by the stewardess and was on
her way to one of the boats when she
suddenly turned and dashed back into
the flaming cabin. In the large boat
fifteen people were afloat. They included
the eight rescued passengers and seven
of the crew, including the captain. The
Emaller boat, which Pilot McMullin had
managed to free, carried seven passen
gers. The two boats were rowed as far
away from the burning steamer as
was necessary to escape destruction,
and waited there and watched the boat
burn.
The tug Bully came to the rescue
and ran in as close as possible, but
nothing could be Been of the nine
missing persons and all hope for saving
them was given up. Those in the'llfe
boats were taken aboard ( and the tug
headed for New York.
The Glen Island was constructed
from the ruins of the City cf Rich
mond. The latter, curiously enough,
also vas burned. After having been
rebuilt the steamer was christened Wil
liam C. Egerton and later renamed Glen
Island.
According to First Mate Larson, the
fiie broke out in the forward part of
the steamboat when she was off Cap
tain's Island. Larsen" declares that It
seemed to have gained a headway
which it was hopeless to attempt to
fight and in a few minutes the entire
vessel was ablaze.
