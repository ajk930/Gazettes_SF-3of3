r T mK HE key of C is the natural key. Xtregntrea
1 no sharps nor flats to make the simple
f chords, and in this lesson, the third of the
series, the charts show how to play accom
paniments in the key of C and its corresponding
key of A minor. Place one of the charts at right
angles with the keyboard so that the small letter
D with a dash above it on thd chart is4irectly over
D on tli t keyboard. Then the white spaces an
the chart will be over the white keys and the
black spaces over the black keys.
The top, the middle and lower sections on the
lower chart represent the three chords, mastery of
which will enable any one to accompany on the
piano any song or melody in the key of 0, and the
other chart represents the chords of the key of A 1
minor. i /
The bfeck letters are to be played with the
left hand and the red letters with the right fiandL
Now, having placed the chart on the piano,
play the black letters on the top section with the
left hand, then the three red letters in unison
with the right hand. Next play the middle sec
tion in the same way, then the lower section, and
then return to the top section. The small letter
D with the dash above it which gives the chart
position must not be played. After a brief prac
tice these chords can be memorized and you may
play without the use of the chart. But with the
chart a person who never struck a note on the
piano before may in a few minutes play the har
monious chords correctly, and then accompany his
or her own songs or the songs of friends. Pro
ficiency requires a little practice, but no pre
vious knowledge of music. " â¢ j
If you desire to delve deeply into the mysteries of
music the charts give you the best possible foun
dation on which to base a musical education. A
knowledge of the keys and their chords underlies
all the triumphs of the accomplished musician.

Â£ * *7"f ND will you live the sort of
f I life that man has made wo
\^ I ir.cn live? Is that fit for you?
JL You can see what it would
do to you. You xyculd get like what
he's like. You would come down to his
level. First you'd share his lies and
Ms intrigues, perforce, while you hated
them. Gradually you'd get to hate
then: less and less: they'd become nor
mal, habitual, easy; tHey'd become
natural. At last you'd see little harm
in them. The only harm or hurt at last
wouM be discovery, and you'd get cun
ning in avoiding that. Think of you
and me living that life â aye, till each
of us loathed the other as well as
loathinp ourselves. Is that what you
mean?"
"Not that, anyhow not that," she
said in a low voice, her eyes wide open
and fixed auestioningly on him.
"If not that ami not the other; what
then? Am I to go.away?" But he put
Caylesham's alternative in no sincerity.
He iÂ»ut it to her only that she might
thruFt it away. If che did not, he
would f=;iurn it himself. "And where
rhouid I go? Back to where I came
fromâ back to that life?"
She could not tell him to go away,
nor to zo back to that life. She sat
silent, jneturing what his life and what
her own would be through all the
years, the livelonsr years, when even
the -boy's !ovÂ« would be bitterness, and
she could have a friend in nobody be
cause of the great sad secret which
would govern all her life.
"I can't tell you.* I can't decide to
day." ; .â¢ ... .'." â â Â£ "
Again and again she had told him
that, fighting against the final and the
irrevocable.
But Blake. was urgent now,,wrought
vp to an effort, very full of his theories
and his aspirations, full too of a rude
natural impatience which he called by
many alien names, deceiving his very
soul that he misht have his heart's
desire, and have It without let or
hindrance. He launched his last argu
ment, a last cruel argument, whose
cruelty seemed justice to a mind ab
eorbed in its own *lnshness. But she
had eyes for no form of selfishness
save Grantley's. To ask all did not
iseeni selfishness to her; it was asking
nothing or loo little that ehe banned.
"You've gone too far," he told her.
"You can't turn back now. Look what
you've done to me gince you came into
my life. Think what you've taught
me to hope and believe â how you've let
me count on you. You've no right to
think of the difficulties or the distress
now. You ought to have thought of all
that lor.g ago."
It was true, terribly true, that she
ought to have thought of all that be
fore. Was it true that she had lost
the right to arrest her steps and the
power to turn back?
"You're committed to it. You're
bound by more than honor, by more
than Jove. You'll be untrue to every
body in turn if you falter now."
It was a clever plea to urge on a
distracted mind. Where decision is too
difficult, there lies desperate comfort
In being convinced that it is already
takc-n, that faets have shaped it. and
p-evious actions irrevocably commit
ted the harassed heart.
"You've made my love for you my
whole life. You knew you were doing
it. You did it with full knowledge
of what it meant. I say you can't
draw back dow."
. He had worked himself up to a pitch
of hijjh excitement. There was noth
ing wanting in his manner to enforce
his words. His case was very excep
tional indeed to him; and so it seemed
to herâ believing in his love because of
the love she had herself to give, yearn
ing to satisfy the hunger she had
caused, to make happy the life which
depended utterly on her for joy.
The long fight, first against Grantley,
â  latterly against herself, had worn and
almost broken her. She had no power
left for a great struggle against her
lover now. Her weariness served his
argument well. It cried out to her to
throw herself into the arms which
were bo eagerly ready for her. One
way or the* other anyhow the battle
must be ended, or surely it would make
an end of her.
But where was an end if she stayed
with Crantley? That life was all
rtruggle, and must be bo long as it en
dured. Who could find rest on a flinty
wall?
She was between that monstrous
image Â£he had made of her husband.
iand the shape which. Blake presented
to her as himself â far more alluring,
not a whit less false. . But for the
falseness of either she bad no eyes.
' "I want your promise to-day," he
said. "Your promise I know you will
keep."
He had become quiet now. There
â was an air of grave purpose about him.
His excitement and ardor had done
their work .with her; this succeeding
mood, or manner (for he had lost all
distinction between what he felt and
â what he made himself seem to feel),
had its place, and was well calculated
to complete his victory.
; "I will send you my answer to
night." she said.
"It means all that I amâ everything
in the world to me. Remember that."
And he urged her no more, leaving
â¢with her these simple sincere-sounding
words to plead for him. -
That was what the answer meant to
him. What' would it mean to Grant
ley Imason? She aaked herself this as
she sat silent opposite to him at din
ner. It chanced that they were alone,
though of late she had schemed to
avoid that. And to-night she could
not speak to him, could say nothing at
all, though his raised brows and satiri
cal 5lar.ee challenged â¢ her. Things
might be uncomfortable, but why lose
either your tongue or your manners,
Grantley seemed to .ask. You might
have a grievance (Oh, real or imagi
nary, as you please!) against your hus
band, but why not converse on topics
of the day with the gentleman at the
other side of the table? He seemed
to be. able to do .his part without any
effort, without any difficulty to avoid
open war, and yet never to commit
himself to any proposition for peace.
All through the years, thought Sibylla,
he would go on suavely discussing the
topics of the day, while life went by,
and love and joy and all fair things
withered from the face of the earth.
The servants disappeared and Grant
ley's talk became less for public pur
poses.
"I wonder how old John has got on
with Harriet Courtland!" he said in an
amused way. '/He was uncommonly
plucky to face Tier. But, upon my
word, the best thing from some- points
of view would be for him to fall. At
least it would be the best. if old Tom
wasn't such a, fool. But as soon as
Tom sees a chance of getting rid of
one woman he saddles himself with
another."
"Could he have got rid of Lady Har
riet?"
"They might have arranged a separ
ation. As it is there'll be an open row,
I'm afraid." . â¢ .
"Still if It puts an end to what's in
tolerable â â¢" she suggested, as she
watched him drinking his coffee and
smoking his cigarette with his deli
cate satisfaction in all things that were
good. C&30
"A very unpleasant way out,", he
said, shrugging his shoulders..* â 
"Would vou have endured what Mr.
Courtland couldn't?" .
He smiled across at her;, the sar
castic note was strong in his voice
as he asked:
"Do you think me an impatient man?
Do you think I've no power of endur
ing what I don't like. . Sibylla??
She flushed a little under his look.
"It's true." he went ; on, "that I en
dure vulgarity worst of- all; and-Har
riet Courtland's tantrums are very
vulgar, as all tantrums are."
"Only tantrums? Aren't all emo-
tions' all feelings, rather vulgar. Grant
ley?"
He thought a smile answer enough
for that. It was no good arguing
against absurd insinuations, or trying
to show them up. Let them alone; in
time they would die of their own ab
surdity. . "./.â â¢' j. 1 /
"Grantley, would you rather I went
away? Don't you find life unendur
able like this?" "â 
"I don't find it pleasant," he smiled ;
"but I would certainly rather you did
not go away. , But if you want a
chanee for a few weeks I'll endeavor to
resign myself."
"I mean, go away altogether."
"No, no, I'm sure you don't mean
anything soâ Forgive me, Sibylla,
but now. and then your suggestions are
hard to describe with perfect courtesy."
. She looked at him In a wondering
way, but made no answer; and he, too,
was silent for a minute.
"I think it would be a good thing,"
he, went on, "If you and Frank betook
yourselves to Milldean for a few weeks.
I'm so busy that I can see very, little
of you here, and country ' air is : good
for nerves." ,
"Very well,. we'll go in a day or two.
You'll stay h,ere?" ' â 'â¢
â¢ "Yes, I must. I'll try to get down
now and then, and â  bring some' cheer
ful people with me. Blake will coma
sometimes, I daresay. Jeremy , won't
till he's rich and famous, I'm afraid.".
In .spite of herself It, flashfed across
her that he was making her path very
easy. And she wondered at the way'
he spoke of Blake, at his utter absence
of suspicion. Her conscience moved a
little at this.
"Yes, I'm sure you'll be better at
Milldean," he went on; "andâ and try
to : think things .over while you're
there." â¢
It was his old . attitude." i He had
nothing to think overâ that task was
all' for her.- The old resentment over
came her momentary shame at deceiv
ing him. Â» , . ' /
"Are they so pleasant. that I want to
think, them over?"
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
"I think you know what I mean; ana
in this connection I don't appreciate
repartee for its own sake," said Grant
ley wearily, but with a polite smile.
A sudden Impulse came upon her.
She leaned across toward him and
said: .
"Grantley, have you seen Frank to
day?"
"No, I haven't to-day."
"I generally go and sit by him for a
little while at this time when I'm free.
Did you know that?"
"1 gathered it," said Grantley.
"You've never come with me, nor
offered to."
"I'm not encouraged to volunteer
things in my: relations with you, Si
bylla. 1 ;
"Will you come with ma now?" she
asked.
She herself could not tell under what
impulse she spoke â whether it were In
hope that at the last he might change,
or in the hope. of convincing herself
that he would' never change. She
watched him very intently, as though
much hungr on the answer that . he
gave. .. â -â >.-â¢
Grantley seemed . to weigh his "an
swer, too, looking at; his. wife with
searching eyes. There' was a patch of
red on his cheeks.' Evidently what she .
'had '.said stirred him, and; his compos-'
ure was maintained only by an effort.
At last he spoke: ' .. â¢ ;
,'Tm; sorry not to do anything . you
,ask or wish, but as matters are I will
not come and see':Frank with you."
"Why not?"., she asked In a quick
half-whisepr. . â¢ "-.â 
His eyes â  were - very ' somber â¢ as he
answered her.' .
"When you remember that you're my
wife, I'll remember that you are the"
mother of; my,, son. Till then you are
an honored; arid" welcome guest . in ; this
houge or In any, house 1 of mine." â  ' 'â  '
Their (eyes -met Both were defiant,
neither showed a'sign of yielding.' Si
bylla, drew in her breath In a long in
halation. .. â¢ â  . I.
"Very well,' I understand," she said.
Hesoaefrom his chair r -;
"You're going upstairs now?" he
suggested, as though about to open
\ tho door.
"I'm going, but I'm not going up
jtairs to-night," she answered as she
rose, "I shall go and write a letter or
two instead."
He bowed politely as she passed out
5f the room. Then he sat down at the
v .able again and rested his head on both
als hands. It took lpngâ It took a very
long while. She was hard to subdue.
Hard it was, too, to subdue himselfâ
to be always courteous, never more
than permissibly ironical^ to wait for
his victory. Yet not a doubt crossed
his mind that he was on the right
track, that he must succeed in the end,
that plain reason and good sense must
win the day. But the right was very
longr. Hla face looked haggard in the
light as he sat alone by the . table and
told himself to persevere.
And Sibylla, confirmed in her de
spair, bitterly resentful of the terms
he had proposed, seeing the hopeless
ness of her life, fearing to look on the
face, of her child lest the pain should
rend her,' too pitilessly, sat down and
wrote her answer to Walter Blake. The
answer was the promise he had asked.
The images had done, their workâ
hers of him and his of. herâ and young
Blake's ; fancy picture of himself.
CHAPTER XHI.
The Dead and Its Dead.
"Well, have you managed to amuse
yourself to-day?" asked Caylesham,
throwing, himself heavily on a sofa by
Tom Courtland and yawning widely.
He had dropped in at Mrs. Bolton's
after, dinner. Tom had spent the day
there and had not managed to amuse
himself very much, as the surly
# grount with which he answered Cayle
sham's- question sufficiently testified.
He had eaten too much lunch, played
cards too long and too- high, with too
many "drinks" interspersed between
the hands; then had eaten a large din
ner,. accompanied by rather too much
champagne; then had. played . cards
again till both his pocket and his tem
per, were the w6rse. There had been
nothing startling, nothing lurid about
his day; it-had Just been unprofitable,
boring, unwholesome. And he did not
care about Mrs. Bolton's friendsâ not
about Miss , Pattie Henderson, "nor
about the . two quiet young men who
had made up the card party; His
face was a trifle flushed and his tooth
brushy hair had even more than usual
. of its suggestion of comical distress.
. "Been a. bit dull, has. it?". Caylesham
went on sympathetically. "Well, it
often is. . Oh, I like our friend Flora
Bolton, you know, so long as she
doesn't get a fit of nerves and tell you
how different she might have been.
People should never do that. At other
times she's o good sort and joist. as
ready to ruin herself as anybody- else
â nothing, of the good old traditional
harpy about her. Still, perhaps it
works out about the same."
It certainly worked out about the
same, as anybody knew better than
Tom Courtland. He was thinking
now that he had paid rather high for
a not very lively day. The only per
son he had won from was Miss Hen
derson, and he was not sure that she
â¢would pay.
"Must spend your time somewhere,"
he jerked out forlornly.
"A necessity of life," ! Caylesham
agreed, "and it doesn't make so much
difference, after all, where you do it.
I rather agree with the fellow who
said that the only distinction he could
see between â well, between one sort
of house and the other sort â -"was that
in the lattar you could be more cer
tain of finding whisky and soda on the
sideboard in the morning. And now
I'm. hanged if that criterion isn't
failing one. Whisky and soda's got so
general."
The card party at the other end of
the room was animated and even a
little noisy. Mrs. Bolton was prone to
hearty laughter. Miss Henderson had
a penetrating voice and usually gave
a little shriek of delight when she
won.; The two young men were rather
excited. Caylesham regarded the
scene with humorous contempt. Tom
Courtland sat in moody silence, doing
nothing. . He had even smoked till he
could smake no more. He had not a
pleasure left.
Presently Mis3 Pattle threw down
her cards and came across to them.
She was a tall, ladylike looking wom
an; only the faintest trace of cockney
accent hung about the voice. She sat
down by Caylesham in a friendly way.
"We hardly ever see you now," she
told him. "Are you all right?"
"All .right, but getting old, Pattie.
I'm engaged in .digging my own
grave." " v
"Oh, nonsense, you're quite fit still.
I say, have you heard about me?"
"Lots of things." .
"No, don't be silly. I mean, that I'm
going to be married?"
"No, are you, by Jove? Who's the
happy man?" ,7"V V-Y
"Georgie Parmenter. Do you know
him? He's awfully nice."
"I know his father. May I proffer
advice?. Get that arrangement put
down in writing. Then at the worst
. it'll be worth something to you."
Miss Pattie was not at all offended.
She laughed merrily. '
"They always said you .were pretty
wide-awake, arid I believe it!" she ob
served.' "He'll have ten thousand a
I year when his father dies."
â "In the circumstances you mention he
won't have a farthing a year till that
event happens, I'm afraid,' Pattie. A
man '. of strong prejudices, old Sir â¢
Georgie." . . .:.*.'. ;v
, "Well, I'm', sure I've got letters
enough to^ " k ' â 
-."That's 'all right. T shall* watch the
case with interest. 1 '. He yawned again
and rose to his feet,
i "Tom's pretty dull, isn't he?" asked
Miss Pattie with, a comical pout.
"Yes, Tom's pretty dull, certainly."
"I'm sleepy," said Tom Courtland.
"So am I. I shall go home," and
Caylesham walked off to bid the lady
of the house good-night.
The lady of the house came into the
hall and helped him on: with his coat.
; It appeared that she wanted to have a
word with himâ first about the wisdom
of backing one of his horses, arid sec
ondly about Tom Courtland. Cayle
sham told- her on no account, to back
the horse, since it wouldn't win, and
waited to hear what she had to say
about Tom. â¢
"I'm distressed about him} Frank,"
she said. "You know I do like Tom,
and I never saw a man so down in
â¢the mouth." Her face was rather
coarse in feature and ruddy* in tint, but
kindly and good-natured; her concern
for Tom was evidently quite genuine.
"What a devil that wife of his must
be!"
"She has her faults. Perhaps we
have ours. Be charitable. Flora.
"Oh, you can be as sarcastic as you
like. Heaven knows I don't mind that!
But I'm worried to death about him,
and about what she'll do. And then
there's the money, too. I believe he's
hard up. It's very tiresome all round.
Oh, I don't care much what people say
of me., but I don't want to go through
the court again, if I can help it."
"Which of the two courts do you
refer to?" he asked, as he buttoned b!3
coat. "Bankruptcy or ?"
"Either of them, Frank, you old
fool!" she laughed.
"Send him back to his wife. You'll
have to soon, anyhowâ when tha
money's, gone, you. know. Do it now â
before those, two men come and stand
opposite to see who goes in and out of
the house."
"But the poor chap's so miserable,
Frank; and I like him, you see."
"Ah, I can't help you against honest
and kindly, emotions. They're not part
of the game, you â¢ know."
"Not they aren't; but they coma in.
That's the worst of it," sighed Mrs.
Bolton. "Well, good-night, Frank. We
shall get through somehow, I sup
pose." ft
"That's The only gospel left to this
age, Flora. Good-night,"
He had not been able to help poor
Mrs. Bolton much; ha had not expected
to be able to. That things could not
be helped and must be endured was,
as he had hinted, about the*one cer
tain dogma of his creed. The thing
then was to endure them as
easily as possible, to feel them as
little as one could either for one's self
or for other people. There was Flora
Bolton's mistake, and a mistake espe
cially fatal for a woman in her posi
tion. She would probably have â¢ been
much happier if she had' not . been
just as ready to ruin herself as she
was to ruin anybody else â if she had,
in fact, been the old traditional harpy
through and through.
In truth it was not the least use dis
tressing himself about Tom Courtland.
Still he -vyas rather worried about the
affair, because Tom, again, was not
thoroughly suited to the part he. was
now playing. Plenty of men were, and
they demanded no pity. But poor old
Tom was not. He could not spend his
money without thinking about it; he
could not do things without consider
ing their bearings and their conse
quences; he could not forget to-mor
row. He had none of the qualifications.
His tendencies were just as little
suited to the game, as we,re Flora Bol
ton's honest and kindly emotions. Tom
was pre-eminently fitted to distribute
*he bacon at the family breakfast and
to take the children for their Sunday
walk, to work away at his politics . in
a solid, undistinguished way," and ".to
have a little margin in hand when he
came to make up the annual budget of
his household. But Lady Harriet had
prevailed to rout all these natural ten
dencies. A remarkable woman Lady
Harriet!
Suddenly Caylesham saw ahead of
him a figure, which he recognized by
the light of tha street lamps. It waa
John Fanshaw going in the direction
of his. home. It was rather late for
John to be .nbout. and Caylesham':*
first idea was to overtake him and ral
ly him on his dissipated hours. He had
already quickened hta $teps with this
view -when it struck him that, after
all, he would not accost John. It might
look as if he wanted to be thanked for
his loan. An>how, John would feel
bound to thank him. and he did not
desire to be thanked. So he fell behind
and followed in that fashion till his
road home diverged from John'3. But
the encounter had turned his thoughts
in. a new direction. Tom and Lady Har
riet were no more in his mind, nor
waa Flora Bolton. He was thinking
about Christine as he turned into his
flat, and being Borry that she had felt
so much dislike to taking the money
from him. It was all right that she
should dislike it, but still he was sorry
for her. Christine's small, dainty faca
had always kept so much of the child
about it that it had the power of mak
ing him very sorry for her just because
she was sorry ior herself, apart from
any gocd reasons at all. His feelings,
however, well schooled they might be.
would not easily have faced a great
distress on Christine's face. - But as ha
got into his dressing gown the somber
hue passed from his mind. Either there
was nothing to worry about or it was
no gcod worrying. Everybody would
get through somehow.
John Fanshaw pursued his home
ward way heavily and slowly. Hs had
gone straight from the Courtlands*
house to the quietest of his clubs and
'sent a messenger to his wife to say
that he was going to dine there and
that she was not to sit up In case he
were late back. He wanted to think tho
thing over, and he did not want to see
Christine. He could not even try to
doubt; Harriet Courtland's passionata
taunt and her passionate remorse â her
remorse most of allâ had^ carried, and
continued to carry, absolute convic
tion; and memory, hideously actlva
and acute, still plied him with.confirm
atory details. After these six years
he remembered things which at tho
time he could hardly have been said to
know; they emerged from insignifi
cance and took on glaring meanings.
How had he been so blind? Yet ha had
been utterly blind. He had had many
quarrels with Christine over money and
so forth; he' had blamed her for many
faults, sometimes justly, sometimes
not. This one thing he had never
suspected â no. nor dreamed â of her.
It seemed to shatter at one blow all
hJs conceptions of their married life.
He was confused and bewildered at
the thought of it â so it cut away foun
dations and tore up deep-grown roots.
Christine do that? Orderly, cool, sar
castic, self -controlled Christine! She
seemed the old Christine no more. He
did not know how to be toward her.
He would hate to have her near him â
she would not seem to be his.
He found himself wishing ha had
known. of the thing at the time. It
would have been a. fearful shock, but
by how he 'would nave grown used' to
It. Something would have been done,
or,' If nothing had been done, the thing
would have become ancient history â a
familiar fact to which they would have
adjusted themselves. It was awful to
be told of it now, when it seemed too
late to do anything, when the wound
was so old, and yet the smart of it so
fresh!
And she had been such a good wife
â yes, on the whole. Their bickerings
had been only bickerings, and ha had
often been as much to blama as she.
On the whole she had bean such a
loyal friend and such a comforting
companion. He had liktd even her
acid little speeches â on tha whole.
He had always thought her not very
demonstrative perhaps, but very true
â true as steel. Cold perhapsâ ha had
felt that and resented it sometimes â
but always true. He had never had
a misgiving as to that In all his mar
ried life. â¢
When he got home ha went straight
to his study and sat down at his writ
ing table. It was 1 o'clock, and Chris
tine would have gone to bed â ha was
glad of that. Ha made an effort to
collect his mind, becausa tha imme
diate question was not of what Chris
tine had done, not of tha blow to him.
not whether ha wanted to see Chris
tine or even could bear to see her. not
of the change all his Ufa and all his
Ideas had undergone.' There was
plenty of time to think of all that
later on. He must think now of tha
other thingâ of how he stood and of
what he was going 1 to do.
He took out his keys and unlocked
the dispatch box that stood on tha
table. After pausing to take a drink
of whisky and water he opened tha
upper drawer and drew forth Cayles
ham's check for Â£15,000. It had been
post dated to the Monday â It was al
ready Monday now. In nine hours it
â was to have been credited to his ac
count at the bank, ready to answer his
obligations, to discharge his commit
ments, to reassure his creditors, to
drive away all the clouds which had
obscured the fair fame of his firm.
Caylesham's check and Grantley's
were to have been salvation. Grant
ley's alone was no use. And Cayles
ham's â he held It In his fingers and
looked at it with a porlns scrutiny.
Twice he reached for an envelope,
in the mind to send it back â to send it
back either with the truth or with a
lie. Once he took hold of either
end. as though to tear it across. But
a paralysis fell on his fingers. How
should he send back, how should he
destroy, that all-potent little slip of
paper? It meant credit, honor, com
fort, peace â perhaps even life. His
imagination pictured two scenesâgo
ing to the city, to his office, next day,
with that slip of paper, and going
without it. The sketch was enough â
his thoughts were busy to fill in the
details. One picture meant a gradual
ascent from that of all his troubles;
the other a fall Into a gulf of calamity
unfathomable. His hands refused to
destroy or to send back the check.
But if he kept it, used it. owed sal
vation to itâ what would that mean?
The question bewildered him. He could
not make out what that would mean
as regarded either himself or Cayles
ham or Christineâ least of all what it
would mean as regarded Christine. He
was dully conscious that the act would
be in some sort a condonation. A con
donation going how far? Imposing
what attitude and what course of con
duct on him? How far would It con
dition his bearing toward Caylesham.
how far affect his estimate of himself?
Above all, how far dictate his relations
to Christine. He knew very well what
would; come of destroying the check or
of sending it back. He could- not rea
son, out what he would stand" commit
ted to If he kept and used it.
Ah. this horrible question could not
have arisen, either, if he had known of
the thing at the time. It was fearful
to be told of it now.
"It's a terrible situation for a manto bs placed in â terrible!" he said'
aloud. â¢
The thought flashed across his mind
that he could pretend not to know. He
could give Lady Harriet a caution; he
could tell her he attached no import
ance to her words; she would take the
hint and be glad. Caylesham would
suspe>ct nothing. He could keep the
check. But Christine? Could he make
that pretense to Christine?
He- was sitting shrunk low into his
chair, the check still in his fingers,
when the door opened softly, and
Christine came in. She had heard him
â¢ pen and close the front door, and
had wondered why he did not come
upstairs. His delay, taken with his
stayinp out all the evening, made her
rts=k- whether anything had happened.
She was in a whitt- dressing gown,
tt'hich she had thrown on when she
sot out of bed. and little slippers of
white fur. She looked very small, very
cainty. very childish; her hair was
like a. child's too, brushed smoothly
""â ay from the forehead.
"Why. John, what's kept you eo late?
And what are you doing here?"
She came some steps toward him be
fore she saw what It was that he held
in his hand. Then she smiled, say
"You're gloating over that check.
yÂ«>u foolish man!"
lie raised dull slow eyes to her.
â¢"Yes. I've got it here." he muttered.
Christine walked to the rug; his
table was on one side of the fireplace,
and she was within five or six feei
of him.
"What are you doing with It?" she
ask?d with an impatient ring in her
voice. She did not enjoy the sight of
the check, and had hoped to be able
by desrrecs to forget It.
"It's dated for Monday. I ought to
pay it in in the morning.'
"Well, why not? Of course you'll
jiay it in." A sudden hope rose in her.
"'Nothing's occurred to make it unne<
ctssary?"
He shook his head heavily, and laid
the paper down on the table.
"No. nothing." he said, and then his
eyes rested on her again.
"John, aren't you well T'. she asked.
Her littleness and her childishness
made no appeal to his tender feelings.
Thpir contrast with what she had done,
with the way she had deceived and be
trayed him. .roused all his repulsion,
again, and with it came now a man's
primitive fierce anger. It was Impos
sible for him to pretend not to know,
rrfan's primitive fierce anger. It was
impossible for him to pretend not to
know.
"Go away!" he said in a thick harsh
Tvhisper. "Go to bed. I don't want
you. I want to be alone."
Her eyes seemed to grow large; a
fearful apprehension dawned In them.
"What's the matter? What have I
done?" she asked, trying to summon
her wits, wondering at what point she
was attacked. Already her thoughts
were on Caylesham. but she did not yet
see whence suspicion could have come.
He gave her no clew. His eyes had
fallen to the check again: he kept
t-l;uffline his less about and fidgeting
â with his short stiff beard.
"Ah." the cried suddently, "you went
to Harriet Courtland's to-day! Has
she said something about me? John,
you wouldn't believe what she said
against me?"
He made no answer. In truth she
r.eeded one. She knew Harriet Court
land, who had been her friend and in
l:er confidence. It had not been con
sidered safe to send Raymore, becausa
Harriet would have taunted him about
!:is erring ton. She knew what Har
riet, blind with rape, had found to
t^unt John Fanshaw with. She was
hardly conscious of resentment against
the traitor. It was all too hopeless for
that, and It all seemed too inevitable.
From the moment she had agreed to go
to CayleFham for the money her fore
bodings had told her that calamity
would come. That was opening the
prave. Now the d>ad bones had come
to life. She felt as though she could
not struggle against it â could not pro
test nor deny. She did not see how
anybody could believe her denial.
"Why haven't you gone? I told you
to go. In God's name, go!" he growled
threateningly. "Leave me alone, I
tell you."
She gathered her dressing gown
closer round her. She felt as though
the cold struck through it to her body.
She felt utterly prostratedâ and, oh, so
terribly, so helplessly sorry for poor
old John. She haled leaving him alone,
and wished there v.as somebody else
there to console him. She made an ad
vance toward him, holding out her
hands.
"Don't come here! Don't come near
me!" he said in a low voice.
She drew back; her eyes were on him
rnd full of pity. Now the check came
into her mind.
"And that?" she whispered.
"I think I shall kill you if you don't
Co." he said, with a sudden unsteadi
ness in his voice. EFm
"Oh, I'll go!" she murmured discon
solately. "I'll leave you alone." She
put her hands up before her face and
cave a choking sob. "It's all no use
now."
She began to walk across the room,
her fate covered In her hands, her
dressing gown trailing on the floor be
hind her. But when she got half way
she turned on him in a fit of weak pet
ulance.
"I didn't want to go to him; I tried
not to. I did all J could to avoid go
ins to him. It was you who insisted.
Ypu made me go. How could I help
it? I hated it! And now " She
came a step toward him, and her
voice changed to a very humble, sad
pleading: "It's very long ago, dear
John, many years ago. It was all over
many years ago."
He did not epeak. He motioned her
away with his hand; her appeal did
not seem to reach him at all. For
all he did, he might not have
heard it. With a long sigh she turned
away and walked unsteadily to the
door. When she reached it she turned
again, and looked at him. He was
putting the check back in the dispatch
box. with awkward trembling hands.
She went slowly up to her room and
Bat down before the dying embers of
the fixe there,
John would send back the check! He
must send it back now; it would be
a fearful thing to keep it knowing
what he did. And if he sent it back
all that happened then would be on
her head! He mustn't send it back!
She etarted up once in a panic, ready
to rush down and implore him to keep
itâ implore him to commit the base
ness of keeping It. No, she could" not,
do that. If she v.cre never to speak
with him again, her last word ought
to be to beseech him to send It back.
But to ser.d it back was ruin. Between
the remorseless alternatives of calam
ity and degradaion her mind oscil
lated in helpless indecision.
Through long hours of the night
John Fanshaw wrestled with himself;
and when at last he crawled up to
his dressing-room, flung off his coat
and waistcoat, put on his slippers, and
stretched himself exhausted on his bed.
he declared that he could come and had
come to no conclusion â that It was too
hard for him. He was trying to de
ceive himself. There was a conclusion
which he would not own which had
crept and insinuated into his mmd,
while he strusrsled against it and de
nied it to himself.
He could not send back nor destroy
the check. Still his hands had refused
that office. He could not face the
city without it, could not endure the
calamity and the ruin which the loss
of it would mean. But neither would
be face the fact and what It meantâ
that he was to become a party to the
transaction, to recognize, to condone
and to pardon. He had no right to
keep his anger, his indignation, the re
pulsion which made him drive Chris
tine from his presence, if he were her
accomplice. If he kept and used the
check what risht had he to moral in
dignation, to a husband's jus^ anger,
to a true man's repulsion at the shame
and the deceit?" Yet he would not give
up these things. He hugged them in
his heart, even while he hugged the
Idea of the check in his mind. . He
would be saved.j but he would not
touch the hand that saved him. That
conclusion did not bear thinking of.
But conclusions which do not bear
thinking of are none the less thoucht
out; they take possession of the pro
testing mind; they establish themselves
there. Then they seek sophisms, ex
cuses, pleas for themselves; thov point
to the good results which spring from
them. Time and familiarity rob them
of some of their ugliness; thev srow
habitual; they govern actions, shape
lives and condition character. John
Fanshaw would have it both ways
salvation by his Wile's sin, and horror
at it.
So Harriet - Court'and would have
love and loyalty, though she bridled
not her evil rage. So Mrs. Bolton
would think that honest and kindly
emotions eoujd flourish in a life like
hers. So Grantley Imason asked all
her inmost life and love of â¢ another,
though the lock was kept turned on
his own. So Sibylla would give the
rein to impulse, and persuade herself
that she performed a duty. So young-
Blake would seek to be made good
by the enjoyment of his darling
sin. Only dainty little Christine
looked open eyed at the pleasure she
had won and at the ruin it had made.
She saw these things clearly as she sat
sleepless through the night. And when
she watched her husband start for his
work the next morning, though he had
told her nc-thing, though not a word
had passed between them, she knew
well that Caylesham's check was in
his pocket and would find its way to
the bank that day. John would have
his salvationâ with or without Its price.
CHAPTER XIV.
For His Love and His Quarrel.
Jeremy Chlddingfold had established
himself in London greatly to his sat
isfaction. He had hired a bedroom in
Ebury street, an attic, and had made
friends with one Alec Turner, a Jour
nalist, who lodged in the same house.
Alec Turner took him often to the Met
ropolitan Radical Club, and had pro
ptÂ«ed him for membership. Here he
could eat at moderate charges, play
chess, smoke and ' argue about all
things In heaven (assuming heaven)
and earth (which, anyhow, was full of
matter for argument). .And at Ebury
street he was not only within 'easy
reach of the Imasons in Sloane street,
but equally well in tc-uch with the" Sel
fords in Eccleston square, and the
Raymores in Buckingham gate. A
third-class on the Underground'Rail
way from Victoria carried him to Liv
erpool street, whence he proceeded to
the dyeing works, near Romford in
Essex. For the dyeing works . project
was taking chape. ' Jeremy had been
down to Romford several times to look
around and see what the processes
were like. He had digested the article
on dyeing of the Encyclopaedia Brit
annica, and had possessed himself of
the "Dictionary of Dyeing" -and the
"Manual of Dyeing." His talk '-: both
at the Metropolitan Radical Club ~ and
at the houses he frequented '.was full
of the learning and the terminology
of dyeingâ things you , dyed, and
things you dyed the things with,
and the things you did it in, and
so forth. He fascinated- Eva Bay
more by referring airily (and at this
stage somewhat miscellaneously) .to
warm vats, and coppems, and lime
vats, to insoluble basic compounds, to
mordan>s and their applications, to sin
gle nnd double muriate of tin. You
could so so. fa-- on the article without
boihering about the Dictionary or the
Manual at all: but then Eva did ho|
know that, and thought him/ vastljl
erudita. in fact Jeremy was in love
with dyeing, and rapidly reconsidered
his estimate of the . Beautifulâ the
Beautiful as suchi even divorced from
Utilityâ in the scheme of nature and
of life. On Alec Turner's recommenda
tion, he read Ruskin and William Mor
ris, and thought still better of . the
Beautiful.
He soon made himself at home both
at the Selfords' and at the Raymores',
dropping in fieely and casually, with
an engaging confidence that everybody
would be glad to see him and pleased
to allow him to deposit his long angu
lar body In an armchair,and talk about
dyeing or the Social Armageddon. He
was, however, interested in other things
tooâ not so much in pictures, but cer
tainly in dogs. He had country lore
about dogs and their diseases, and so
won. Mrs. Selford's respect. He found
Anna Selford's keen mind an interest
ing study, and delighted to. tease the
pretty innor.cence of Eva RaymoreMn
neither house was there a young manâ
no son at the Selfords', and the Ray
moros* house was empty of theirs; and
Jeremy, in his shabby coat, with his
breezy Jollity and vigorous young self
assertion, came like' a gust, of fresh
wind, and seemed to blow the dust out
of the place. Mrs.- Raymore, above all,
welcomed him. He went straight to
her heart; she was for ever comparing
and contrasting him with her own boy
so far awayâ and only Just the inevit
able little to his disadvantage. Jeremy,
In his turn, though unconsciously, loved
the atmosphere of the Raymores' house
âthe abiding sense of trouble, hard to
bear but bravely borne, and the close
ness of heart, the intimacy of love
which it had brought. Being at the
Selfords' amlsed him; but being at the
Raymores' did more than that.
And what of his broken heart? r Arina
Selford had heard the story and asked
him once in her mocking way.
-'.'You seem so very cheerful, Mr.
Chiddingfold!" said she.
Jeremy explained with . dignity. : His
heart was not broken: It-had merely
been wounded. Not only.dld:he.con
sider It his/ and any man's,'- duty. to be
cheerful,. but as a fact he found rib dif
ficulty in being .cheerful, "occupied as
he was with- the work of life, and -sus
tained 'toy. a firm purpose and -an, un
shaken resofve. -. >- i. â _ .
"Only I don't care. to. talk about; it,"
he added, by which he meant, - really,
that he did not care to, talk abouMt'to
persons of a satirical ; turn. :â¢ MrsoRay
more could get; him to talk about it
very freely,- while to"Eva r be. would
sometimes (usually for short times) be

so moody and melancholy as to excite
an interest of a distinctly sentimental
nature. It 'is to be feared that, like
most lovers, Jeremy was not above a
bit of posing now and then. He was
having a very, full and happy life, and,
without noticing the fact, began grad
ually' to be more patient about the
riches and the^fame. v
None the less, affairs. were In. train.
Selford's working partners were dis
posed to be complaisant about Jeremy
and the dyeing works; they were will
ing to oblige Selford, and found them
selves favorably impressed by the
young man himself. But business is
business. They could give him a pit
tance forever, no doubt. If he wanted
that very thingâ an openingâ other
considerations came to- the front. .Good
openings are not lightly given away, j
In fine, Jeremy could come .'and. try
his hand at a nominal salary. If he
proved his aptitude, 1 they would be will
ing to have him for a Junior partner;
but in that case he must put five thou
sand pounds into the "- business. The
sum was not a: large one to ask. they
said; and with all their good opinion
of Jeremy and all their desire to oblige
Selford. they could not, in Justice to
themsslves, their wives,, and their
families, put the figure any lower. '
It was rather a shock to Jeremy, this
first practical illustration of the per
vading truth that, in order to get money
you must have some first. He might
give all he had in the world, and not
realize five thousand pounds. He went
to tea at the Raymores' that- evening
with his spirits dashed. He had con
sulted Alec. Turner, but that young
man had only whistled, implying there
by that Jeremy might whistle for the
money too. . The journalistic tempera
ment was not, Jeremy felt, naturally,
sympathetic: so he laid the question
before Mrs." Raymore. *
To her it was " the opening of the
sluice-gates. She " was full of maternal
love, dammed up./ by distance and ab
sence." She was tender and' affectionate
toward Eva, but her 'love for, her
daughter was pale, and weak beside her
feeling for her only son; and ; now a
portion of the 'flow meant for far-off
Charley * was diverted to . Jeremy. .- She
loved and could have wept his
brave simplicity,' hlf) sincere question as
to how 'he- could^ speedily make five
thousand ' pounds. . He : was not : a fool ;
he . knew L he i could .: not ; break the bank
atJMorite. t Carlo,;or write; a- play or. a
novel, or get k the desired sum thereby if
he C did ;Y. but r,. he. â  had"?, the . great Z folly,
which clings to : men older than he was
âthe - belief /'that i blind -impartial : f or*
tune " may - 1 show â  special , ; divine . favor,
ate i Raymore smiled and- sighed. .
' "Have -you - noj friends who < would
"guarantee ~ itâ who .would advance it?
You could pay interest,; and pay off the
capital i gradually," " she ; suggested.
That waa not at all. Jeremy's idea.
"No, I don't want to do that. I
don't want to be indebted to anybody."
'"But it's a pity to let the chance slip,
from a feeling of that sort," she urged.
"Besides there's nobody in our family
who ever, had bucK" >a lot of money to
spare," "said Jeremy, descending to the
practical. He. sighed too, and acknowl
edged the first check to . his ardent
hopes, the first disillusionment. In the
words: "I must wait." When a man
says that he must wait, he has begun
to know something of the world. The
lesson that often he must wait In vain
remains behind.
"But I shall find out some way," he
went on (the second lesson still un
learned). I've got a fortnight to give
my answer in. They'll keep It open for
me till then."
Eva came in, with her large learning
eyes,*and her early charming girl's
wonder at the strength and cleverness
of the young men she liked. In a very
few minutes Jeremy was confident and
gay, telling her how he had the pros-,
pect of a partnership in quite a little
while. Oh, yes, a Junior partnership,
of course, and a minor share. But it
ought to be worth four or five hundred
a year anyhowâ yes, to start with.
And what it might come to â in vigor
ous hands,' with new blood, new in
tellect, new energyâ well, nobody could
tell.':'", Mr. Thrale's casks and vats were
not reallyâ as a potentiality of growing
rich beyond the dreams of avarice â
comparable to Jeremy's vats and. mor-
dants and muriates. Eva was wonder
fully impressed and . exclaimed, : in
childish banter:
v"I .hope you'll know us still, after
you're as rich as that!" â 
Jeremy liked that. It was Just the
sort of feeling which his wealth was
destined to raise in Dora Hutting.
Meanwhile, pending the absence and
obduracy of : Dora, it was not unpleas
ant to see it reflected in Eva's won
dering . eyes. Mrs. Raymore listened'
and looked on with a fixed determina
tion to lose ho" time in telling Grant
ley Imason that for a matter of flva
thousand pounds, the happiness of a
lifeâ of a life . or â  twoâ was to be had.
The figure was often cheaper, than
that," of course; less than that often
meant joy or. woe â far less. Witness
Charley in "Buenos Ay res, over youth
ful folly and a trifle of a hundred and
fifty! But Grantley was rich â and she
did not know that he had. recently lent.
John Fanshaw fifteen thousand
pounds.
In requltaj for services rendered at
the Metropoli tali. Radical, Jeremy had
introduced his friend Alec Turner to
the Selfords. Alec had come up to
town from the staff a provincial
journal, and found very few houses
open to him in London, so that he was
grateful. He had a native, although
untrained, liking for art, and could
talk i about pictures to Selford, while
Jeremy talked about dogs to Mrs. Sel
ford;* and both the young men sparred
with Anna,"; whose shrewd hits kept
them - well, on their defense. Alec
went about his avocations In a red tie,
a : turned down collar and lively mus
tard-colored - clothes. - A dress suit he
assumed reluctantly when he was . sent
to report the speeches of prosperous
Philistine persons at public dinners.
He hated I prosperous Philistine ; per
sons, especially, if their prosperity, (and
consequent Phlllstlnlty) came from art
or letters, and delighted : in composing
paragraphs which should ; give them . a
little, dig.- He was, however, not really
ill-natured,, and .would not have hurt
â  the ' prosperous i persons i seriously, ,* even
if - he * could have; \ he } was ; anxious \ to
declare : -. that ; neither he nor j -anybody
â¢ else: could,' in fact,' hurt them seriously,
owing . to : the stupidity .of - the public^â
which was incalculable. He was a de
cided assistance to Jeremy in enliven
ing the Selford household and in keep
ing Anna's wits busy and bright.
"I suppose nothing would induce you
to be successful?" she said to him
with malicious simplicity.-".
"Success for me means something
Quite different," Alec explained. "It
lies in influencing the trend of public
opinion."
"But the public's hopelessly stupid!
It seems to me rather foolish to spend
your time trying to influence hopeless
ly stupid people."
Jeremy chuckled. 'He did not see
how Alec was going to get out of that.
' "I spoke of the bulk. There is a
-small intelligent minority on whom one
can rely."
"If you can rely on them already,
why do they want influencing?" ob
jected Anna.
"On whom one can rely for a hearing
and for intelligent appreciation, Miss
Selford." .
" "Then the fewer people who care
what you say, the more successful you
really are?"
"That's hardly the way I should put
it-~-"
"No, I' don't suppose you would," in
terrupted Anna. "But it comes to
that, doesn't it, Jeremy?"
"Of course It does," agreed Jeremy.
"The' fact is, . writing about things is
all rot. Go and do something â some
thing practical."
Dyeing was something practical.
"Oh, yet, go Into business, of course,
and get rich by cheating! Trading's
only another name for cheating."
"Well, you're right there for once,",
said Anna.
"Right?" cried Jeremy. fiercely.
"Well, then, why isn't it cheating
when he" (he pointed scornfully at
Alec) "charges a ha'penny for his
. beastly opinion about something?"
"Oh, it's not for me to say! You
must ask Mr. Turner that."
In fact the discussions were of a most
spirited order, since- everybody was al
ways quite wrong, and each in turn
could be rapidly and ignominiously re
futed, the other two uniting in a warm
but transient alliance to that end.
This young and breezy society was
good for Selford, and for his wife too.
It gave them something to think about, '
and did not leave each so much time
to consider the unreasonableness of the
other. Tiffs became less frequent, the
false eentimentalism of their reconcilia
tions was less in demand; and as they
watched Anna's deftness and bright
ness, they began" to ask whether they
had been as proud of her as they
ought to be.
"She's got brains, that girl of ours,"
said Selford, nodding his head com
placently.
"And a taking manner, don't you
think. Dick?"
"Those boys find - her attractive, or
it looks like it, anyhow!".
"Of course she's not exactly pretty,
but I do think she's rather distingushed
somehow."
"Your daughter would be sure to be
that, my dear Janet," he remarked gal
lantly.
"No, I r !y think she's more like
you," insisti I Janet amiably. "I must
make an effort" (Mrs. Selford was fond
of that praise) "and take her out into
society more. I don't think we're quite
giving her her chance."
"Ah, you've begun to think of
match-making!" he cried In playful re
proof.
But It pleased him highly to think
that he had, after all, an attractive
daughter. He took much more notice
of her than he had been used to take, -
and Mrs. Selford eyed her with critical
affection. Decidedly the increa/e of
human interest, as opposed to artistic
and canine, was a good influence in the
Selford household.
Anna soon saw how her position had
Improved. She was not demonstrative
about it, but she appreciated it. She
was also 'sharp enough to use it. The
next time an Invitation to a party
came, . she refused to go * unless she
might have a frock of her own choos
ing. .
"I won't go if I'm to look a' guy!" she
â aid. .
There was a battle over that, a battle
between her and Mrs. Selford, and a
tiff between father and mother to boot.
For Selford was with Anna now. They
. won the day, and Anna with a check in
her pocket, went off to consult Chris
tine Fanshaw, nursing in her heart
that joy which only the prospect of
being dressed really Just as you'd like
to be dressed seems'able to excite.
"Merely a malicious desire to cut out
the other girls," comment Alec loftily.
"I really don't think you ought to
talk about dress," retorted Anna, e>
ing the mustard suit.
But when Anna appeared in the frock
which Christine had sedulously and
lovingly planned, she carried all before
her. She was most undoubtedly dis
tinguished.
"Well, I suppose you've come to an
age when that charming simplicity
/which used to suit you so well must
give way to something more stylish,"
even Mrs. Selford admitted, capitulating
and marching outâ but with the honors
of war.
Grantley Imason was rich; yet fifteen
thousand pounds .is a solid sum of
money. To put that sum at John Fan
shaw's disposal had not caused him
* serious ( inconvenience, but it had en
tailed a little contriving. To lay out
another five thousand In Jeremy's ser
vice would involve more contriving,
and the return of the money rested, of
necessity, in a distant and contingent
future. Nevertheless, when Kate Ray
more uggeted that the happiness
of a life should be secured,
he found the proposition attractive.
He was a man lavish of money and
appreciative of all the various pleas
ures of giving it away â both those. of
a more and those of a less self-regard-
Ing order. He enjoyed both the delight
of the recipient and ' the sense of his
own generosity and his own power. He
would like Jeremy to be indebted to
him for the happiness of his life â of*
course that was an exaggerated way of
putting it, but it was a telling ex
aggeration. He also liked Jeremy very
much for his own sake. And it would
be altogether a handsome thing to do â
under present circumstances a pecu
liarly handsome thing. , For Sibylla had
left him and gone down to Milldean, ac
companied by the boy, without a word
of friendship or a hint of reconcilia
tion; and Jeremy's welfare was very
dear to his sister. To help Jeremy, and
thereby prepare for her the pleasure
of seeing Jeremy prosper, to do this
â  secretly, to have it as a private merit
.and a hidden claim on her, was an idea
which appealed strongly to Grantley.
In his imaginings she was to discover
.what he had done in the future, but
Vnot till after their reconciliation.' Would
it not have an effect then? One effect
' it was to have was. in plain words, .to
make Sibylla feel ashamed: but Grant
ley did not put it so simply or so nak
edly as thatâ that would have been to
â¢recognize the action as almost pure
revenge. He blinked that side of It,
and gave prominence to the other sides.
But â  that side â¢ was there among the
.rest; and he would suffer wrong at
her hands with , the more endurance
the greater were the obligations she
was -under to him. His love for her
and his quarrel with-^er joined hands
to urge. him. Commanding: Kate Ray
more to respect his desire for secrecy,
he undertook to consider the matter.
But his mind was really made, up; and
since the thing was to be done, it
should be done liberally and splendid
ly." " He had lent his ' money to Fan
shaw, as Caylesham had surmised,
with a very, satisfactory prospect of re
payment; to Jeremy he was ready -to
lend It on no security, careless about re
' payment, because he loved Sibylla and
- because : he â  hat/ so . grievous a quarrel
against her. It was â  all a part of his
' broad ' anil ' consistent plan, of conquer-
ing her by his unchanging patience, un
changing love, unchanging persistence
in being just what he had always been
to her from the beginning, however
sore a trial her unreasonableness and
her vagaries might put him to. This
generosity to Jeremy would be a flue
example of his chosen attitude, a fine
move in the strategy on \vhich he had
staked the ultimate success of hl3
campaign against Sibylla.
"If I decide to do it. I'll tell Sibylla
myself, at my own time, and in my own
wayâ remember that," he said to Kate
Raymore.
She had an idea that things had not
been going quite smoothly, and nodded
in a wise fashion. ''She was picturing a
pretty scene oi sentiment when Grant
ley confessed his generosity. Of the
real state of his mind she had no idea.
but her own conception of the case was
enough t,o ensure her silence.
* Grantley went to work quietly, say
ing nothing to Jeremy, approaching the
working partners through Selford.
learning what they thought of Jeremy,
nut letting them suppose that the sum
required was lightly to come by or
was considered a small one, making,
like a good man of business, the best
bargain^ that he could for the object of
.his bounty. These negotiations took
some days, and during those days
Jeremy's heart lost something of Its
buoyancy, though nothing of Its cour
age. London was having its effect on
his receptive mind â the crowd, tha
stress, the push, the competition. Cour
age and brains enough to rise by?
Perhaps, but not enough to rise by
quickly. A walk about the streets, a
look at the newspapers, the talk at the
Metropolitan Radical, all taught him
that. Wait and work â wait and work!
That was what they all said â and none
of them sr.id that It was easy to lay
your hands on five thousand pounds.
The light of truth began to glimmer
through those folds of young self-confi
dence. Jeremy grew sober; he was no
more so gay and so assured in talking
with Eva Kaymore. He allowed him
self to dwell less on that mythical re
turn to Milldean with fame and riches.
Now and then, it must be confessed,
he had to brace himself up lest his
very courage should falter. He con
trived to keep it; but with it there
â¢came now the feeling r.ew to Jeremy â
a humility, a sense that he was. after
all, as other men were, and neither by
natural endowment nor by any rare
caprice of fortune to be different from
them or to find his life other than
theirs. He, too, was not above the
need of Â«. helping hand; for want of it
he, too, might have to tread very long
ar.d very dreary paths before he made
much Impression on the hill which he
had set out to- climb so gaily, and with
so little provender for the Journey. In
such a mood as this he was as incap
able of expecting any sudden interposi
tion of outside aid as of refusing it
when it came. He would protest, he
would declare that he must refuse, but
refuse in the end he could not. The
fierce jealousy of his independence was
cooled by his new ' experience of the
world.
He heard first of what was being
done from one of the partners down at
Romford. The matter was practically
concluded, he was told; in two years'
time he was to have the Junior part
nership, and the share allotted to him
at that date would be somewhat larger
in consideration of the stipulated cap
ital being paid immediately â it hap
pened to be wanted for an extension of
the buildings. Jeremy threw over work
for that day, aod hurried back to Lon
donâto refuse. But all the way he
was thinking of the incredible differ
ence this benevolent interposition
would make.
He found Grantley in hl3 study after
lunch. The deed regulating the ar
rangements between the partners on
the one side and Jeremy and himself
on the other was before him. A look
at Jeremy's face told him that Jeremy
knew.
"Iâ I can't take it, you know."
Jeremy blurted out.
"You can't escape the obligations S1-.
bylla has brought on yuu by marrying
me," smiled Grantley.
"Of course Sibylla's been at you â told
you she couldn't be happy unless â "
"Nothing of the kind. Sibylla knows
nothing about it; and, what's more, she
isn't to know till I choose to tell her â
till I choose, not you â that's part of the
bargain, Jeremy."
Jeremy sat down. Anxious to avoid
a formal talking-over of the matter,
Grantley got up and lit a cigarette.
"Then why have you done it?" asked
Jeremy.
Grantley shrugged hl3 shoulders.
"Of course it's the one thing In tha
world for me; but â but I wanted to do
it for myself, yo-u know." Grantley still
smiled on him. with a touch of mock
ery now. "Yes, well, I know I
couldn't." He looked at Grantley in a
puzzled way. "What makes it worse,"
he went on, "is that I've been doing
you an Injustice in a kind of way. X
knew you were always kind and â and
Jolly, but somehow I thought you wÂ«re
a fellow, who wouldn't put himself out
very much forâ anybody else.
"I'm not putting myself out. I lilts
it."
"Planking down five thousand, and
not knowing when you'll get it back.
If ever you do? If you like that for its
own sake, it's rather a rare taste."
"Now don't Jaw any more," said
Grantley with friendly impatience. "1
was Just going to sign the deed when
you came in. I should have done it by
now, but I must have a witness, and I
didn't want to ring Thompson up from
hi3 dinner. We'll ring him up now."
"I'm not an ass," said Jeremy. Z
don't think that because a man mar
ries a woman he's bound to provid* for
her familyâ or to like them, either."
"You grow in worldly wisdom."
"Yes, I fancy I do. I know a bit
more about myself, too. I might hxv*

"Oh, thank my forefathers! Pve not

for you." His back had been to
Jeremy. He turned round now aa he
said slowly: "You may consider it aa
a thank offering for my happiness with
Sibylla."
"And why isn't she to knowl**
â¢*I . like it better that way for thÂ«
present. I'm.entitled to make that con
dition." C
Jeremy went, back to his defenM'oC
himself against himself.
"A week ago Iâ I'd havetacked my
self to make it somehow. Butâ well,
one soon learns how devilish hard it 1*
to; get -What one wants. What a coat
ceited young idiot you must ha.v<
thought me when we used to talk da-ad*
at Milldean !"
"You were always an excellent com
panion. Let's ring for Thompson and
execute the deed."
Jeremy could not refuse and could
not yet consent. Grantley stood smok
ing airily and looking at him with a
whimsical smile. Then the door
opened and the butler came In, unsum
znoned.
"Ah, the Fates decide!" exclaimed
Grantley with a laugh. "Where's a
pen, Jeremy?"
"For you, sir," said Thompson, hold
ing out a salver with a letter on it. .
"Oh!" Grantley laid down his pen.
took the letter, and sat down at the
writing-table. "Wait a minute; I want
you to witness something for me," ha
said* to the butler.
Thompson stood In serene Immobility.
His thoughts were far feway, engrossed
in a discussion he had been having
with the groom as to the ."form" of
that same horse of Cayleshajn's about
which Mrs. Bolton had wanted to
know. Jeremy sat making up his mind
to endure helng helped and poignantly
remorseful about the view he had
taken of Grantley. The view was
earnestly disclaimed now; tha help
seemed fine i%d wonderful. H* did so
want hope, acogl. a. chance, a, lUry aadthat all his talk of what he would do
should not come to naught. In turn
Dora, Eva and Anna passed through
his mind, each bringing her own in
fluence to bear, giving him a new pic
ture of the future. And why refuse?
If ever a gift had been freely, grandly
offered, this was. Would it not be even
churlish to refuse? Reasons or no
reasons, his heart and his hands went
out lestipctively; he could not refuse
the beginning of all things.
Giving his head a restless little jerk
as at last he accepted this decision, he
chanced to turn his eyes on Grantley's
face. His attention was caught and
arrested by it. There was something
strange there. The cheeks were rather
pale, the jaw set rigidly. Grantley read
his letter with a curious engrossmentâ
not hurriedly nor offhand, as a man
generally reads when other business is
at a standstill till ha reaches the end.
He turned back, it seemed, once or
twic, to look at another sentence again.
Even Thompson awoke to the fact that
he was being kept waiting a long while,
and that the groom would probably
finish the beer and go away, leaving
their Important discussion unfinished
and the proper odds unascertained.
Grantley had recognized Christine
Fanshaw's large irregular handwriting,
and had expected nothing more serious
than an invitation to dinner. But he
was not reading an Invitation to dinner
now.
"I have Jast heard from Sibylla/ â
from Milldean. Sha incloses a letter
for you, which ah,e says I am to send
en to ycu to-morrow. She insists that
I am not to send It before; and If I
won't do as she asks, I am to burn It.
You are not to have it to-day. I can
not dieobey her in this, but she says
nothing: about my telling you she has
sent a letter; tha only thing Is that I
must not deliver It to you till to-mor
row. I had no idea you had let her
go down to Milldean alone. How could
you let her do this? There is one other
thing I must say to you. Walter Blake
was to have dined here to-night. This
morning he wired excuses, saying he
was going for a cruise in his yacht.
You must consider what that means. I
beg you not to wait for the letter, but
go to Milldean this afternoon. Say
nothing of having heard from me.
Just go as if by accident; say you got
your work done sooner than you ex
pected, or anything you like, but go. I
believe you'll be sorry all your life If
you don't go. Let nothing stop you,
for your own sake, and still more for
hers.â C. F."
That was the letter; the sentence he.
had turned back to reread was the one
in which Walter Blake's movements
were mentioned.
Grantley looked across to Jeremy.
"Have you heard from Sibylla since
she went to Milldean?" he asked.

"Not a line. But she doesn't write
much to me."
Again Grantley looked at the paper.
Thfcn he laid it down and took up his
in-n.
"Now for the deed," he said, and
drew it to him.
He signed. Thompson fulfilled the
formality for which he was required,
and then left them alone. Jeremy did
not break out into new thanks. That
unexplained something in Grantley's
face forbade him.
"I can only say that I'll try to Jus
tify your extraordinary kindness," he
said soberly.
Grantley nodded absently, as he rose
and put Christine's letter Into the fire.
It was better thereâ and there was no
dancer that he would forget the con
tents.
"I say, there's no bad news, is
there?" Jeremy could not help asking.
"No news at all, good or bad," an
swered Grantley, as he held out his
hand. "Good-by and good luck, Jer
emy."
Jeremy took his hand and gripped it
hard, emotion finding a vent that way.
G.rantley returned the pressure more
moderately.
"Remember, under no circumstances
a word about It to Sibylla!" he said.
"I give you my honor." 'V.'
"Good."
He released Jeremy's hand and
turned away. He had much self-con
trol, but he could not be sure of what
was showing on his face.
Jeremy had his great good fortune,
but his joy was dashed. Grantley
looked like a man whom heavy calam
ity finds unprepared.
"Ail the finer of him to sign the deed
then and there," Jeremy muttered as
he left the house. "Whatever has hap
pened, he didn't forget his word to
me." -
But it was not of Jeremy or of his
word that Grantley had been thinking
when he signed. His signature was a
defiance of his wife and of his fate:
CHAPTER XV.
In the Teeth of the Storm.
An instinct of furtiveness, newly
awakened by the suggestion of Chris
tine Fanshaw's letter, had led Grant
ley Imason to send no word of his
coining. He hired a fly at the station,
and drove over the downs to Mill
dean. It was a wild evening:. A gale
had been blowing from the southwest
all day, and seemed to be Increasing In
violence. A thick rain was driven in
sharp spats against the closed win
dows. The old horse tolled slowly
along, while the Impatient man chafed
helplessly Inside.
At last he stopped at Old Mill House
and dismissed* the carriage. Mrs.
Mumple's servant girl came to the door,
and said her mistress was up at 'his
houee, and was, she thought, to stay
there all night. . Grantley nodded, and
began to trudge up the hill. He had
no thought but to seek and flnd Sibyl
la. It was now between 7 and 8, .and
dusk had fallen.
He saw a light In tha dining-room
windows. He walked Into the. hall and
took off his hat. A servant saw him
and ran to help him. Saying briefly
that he would want some dinner, he
went into the dining-room.. Mrs. Mum
ple sat there alone over a chop.
"You come home, Mr. Imason!" she
exclaimed. "Sibylla didn't expect you,
did she?"
"No, I didn't texpect to come. I
didn't think I could get away, and it
wasn't worth wiring-. Where is Si
bylla?"
"How unluckyj She's gone away â to
Fairhaven. Sha didn't expect you.
She's to sleep the night there." â¢
He came to the table and poured
himself out a glass of sherry. He was
calm and quiet In his manner.
"To sleep at Fairhaven? Why, who's
she going to stay with?" %
"Mrs. Valentine. You know her? She
lives by the churchâ a red housa with
creepers."
Mrs. Valentine was, as he knew, an
old, but not an Intimate, acquaintance.
He shot a keen glance at Mrs. Mum
ple's simple broad face.
"I'm here to look after, baby. But, of
course, since you've come ** .
"No, no, you stay here; and go on
with your dinner. They'll bring some
thing for me directly."
Ht pulled up a chair and sat down.
"To sleep at Mrs. Valentine's? Has
Ehe often done that before when I've
been away?"
"She used to as a girl- sometimes, Mr.
Imason; but no, never lately, I think
not sines she married."
There were no signs of disturbance
or distress about Mrs. Mumple. Grant
ley sat silent while the servant laid a
place for him and promised some din
ner in ten minutes. . .
"Has Sibylla been all right?"
"Oh. yes. A little fretful the last
day or two. I think. But Mr. Blake
came over from Fairhaven yesterday,
and she had a nice walk with him;
and she was with baby all the morn-
Ing."
"All the morning? When did she go
to Fairhaven?"
"I think It was about 3' o'clock. It's
a terrible evening, Mr. Imason."Â»
"Very rough, irtdeed."
"The wind rose quite suddenly th,is
morning, and it's getting worse every
minute."
Grantley made no answer. After a
pause the old woman went on:
"I've got some news." â¢
"News have you? What news?"
He was suddenlv on the alert %
She_ glanced at the door to make sure
the servant was not within hearing.
"Very great news for me, Mr. Ima
son. ., Sly dear husband's to come three
months sooner than I thought. I got a
letter ' to say so just after Sibylla
started."
"Oh, really! Capital, Mrs. Mumple!"
"It's, only a matter of six months
now. You can't think what I feel
about it â now it's as near as that. I
haven't seen him for hard on ten years.
What will it be like? I'm full of Joy.
Mr. Imason; but somehow I'm afraid
tooâ terribly afraid. The thought of
it seems to up'set me, and yet I can't
think of anything else."
Grantley rubbed his hand across his
brow. Old Mrs. Mumple's talk reached
him dimly. He was thinking hard.
This sleeping at Mrs. Valentine's
sounded an unlikely story.
Mrs. Mumple, in her turn, forgot her
chop. She leaned badk In her chair,
clasping her fat hands in front of her.
"We shall have to pick up the old
life." She went on. "After seventeen
years! I was 35 when he left me, and
nearly as slight as Sibvlla herself. I'm
past 50 now, Mr. Imason, and it's ten
years since I saw him; and he's above
60, andâ and they grow old soon in
there. It'll be very different, very dif
ferent. Andâ and I'm half afraid of
It, Mr. Imason. It's terribly hard to
pick up a life that's once been broken."
The servant brought In Grantley's
dinner and Mrs. Mumple pretended to
go on with her chop.
"Nurse said I was to tell you Mas
ter Frank is sleeping nicely," the ser
vant said to Mrs. Mumple, as he placed
a chair- for Grantley.
That was a strange story about Mrs.
Valentine.
"We must have patience and love,
on," said airs. Mumple. "He's had a
grievous trial and bo have I. But I
don't lose hope. All's ready for himâ
his socks and his shirts and all. I'm
ahead of the time. I've nothing to do
but wait. These laet months'll seem
very long, Mr. Imason."
Grantley came to the table.
"You're a good woman, Mrs. Mum
pie," he said.
She shook her head mournfully. He
looked at the food, pushed it away and
drank another glass of sherry.
"Don't think I've no sympathy with
you. but â but I'm worried." ;
"Nothing gone wrong in town, I hope,
Mr. Imason?" . â 
"No."
He stood there frowning. He did
not believe the story about Mrs. Val
entine. He walked quickly to the bell
and rank it loudlv.
"Tell them to saddle Rollo, and bring
him round directly."
"You're never golngf out on such -a
night?" she cried. : â 
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
' "I must;" and he added to the sur
prised servant: "Do as I tell you di
rectly."
"Where are vou going*" she asked
wonderingly. - ,~: b. -v f- â '. -
"I'm going to Mrs, Valehtint'a/*
"But you've no causa to be anxious
about Sibylla.. Mr. Imason; and she'll
be back to-morrow." .
Qjrantley was- convinced that she, at
least, was Innocent of any plot. - Sim
ple sincerity spoke on her face, and all
her thoughts 'were for herself and her
dearly cherished fearful hopes.
"I must see Sibylla on a matter of
urgent business to-night,"_ he said.
"It'll be hardly safe up on the
downs," she expostulated.
"It'll be safe enough for me," he an
swered grimly. ' "Don't sit up for me;
and look after the baby." 'He smiled at
her kindly, then came and patted her
hand for a moment. "Yes, it would be
hard to pick up a life that's once
broken, I expect," he said.
She looked up at him with a sudden
apprehension in her eyes. His manner
was strangely quiet; he seemed to her
gentler.
"There, I mean nothing but what I
say," he told her soothingly. "I must
go and get ready for my ride."
"But, Mr. Imann, you'll take some
thing to eat first?" â
"I can't eat." He laughed a little.
"I should like' to drink, but I won't.
Good night, Mrs. Mumple."
Ten minutes later ha was walking his
horsa down tha hill to -Milldean, on
his way to Fairhaven. But ha had lit
tle thought of Mrs. Valentine; he had
no belief in that story at 'all.' It served
a purpose, but not the purpose for
which it had been meant. What it did
was to remove the last of his doubts.
Now he knew that Christine's sugges
tion was true. Ha was going to Fair
haven not to flnd Sibylla at, Mrs. Val
entine's, but to seek Sibylla and Blake
he knew not where. ;
: He thought not much of Sibylla. He
had taught himself to consider his
wife Incalculable â a prey to disordered
whims, swept on by erratic Impulses.
This whim was more extraordinary,
more disorderly, more erratic than any
of the others; but it was of the same
nature with them, the same kind of
thing that she had done when she de
termined to hold herself aloof from
him. This blow had fallen entirely and
utterly unforeseen, but he acknowl
edged grimly that it had not been un
foreseeable. He thought even less of
young Blake, and thought of him
without much conscious anger. The
case there was a very plain one. He
had known young Blake in the days
when aspirations did not exist, and;
when the desire to be good was not part
of his life. He took him as he had
known him then-, and the case was very
simple. Whatever an attractive woman
will give, men like Blake will take,
recking of nothing, forecasting nothing,
careless of themselves, merciless to her
whom they are by way of lpving. In
regard to Blake the thing had nothing
strange in it. Here, too, it was unex
pected, but again by no means unfore
seeable.
No, nothing had been, unforeseeable;
and In what light did that fact leave
him? What flavor should that give to
his meditations? For though. he rode
as quickly as he could against the gale
and the rain which* now blinded and
scorched his eyes, his mind moved
more quickly still. Why, -It set him
down as a fool intolerable â as the very
thing he had always laughed at and
despised, as a dullard, a simpleton, a
dupe. He could hear the mocking
laughter and unashamed chuckling, he
could see the winking eyes. He. knew
well enough what men thought of him.
They had.. attributed to him success
with women; they had Joked when he
married, saying many husbands would
feel safer; they had liked hi 1 and ad
mired him, but they had been of opin
ion that he wanted taking down a peg.
How they would laugh to think that he
of all men had made such a mess of it,
that he had let young Blake take away
his wifeâ young Blake, whom he had
often chaffed for their amusement or
Instructed for their entertainment!
Imason had got a pretty wife, but he
couldn't keep her, poor old boy! That
would be the commentâ an ounce of
pity to a hundredweight of contempt,
andâ yes, a pound of satisfaction. And
it would be all true. ; Somehow â even
allowing for Sibylla's vagaries and un
accountable whims, he could not tell
howâ something he had been a gross
dupe, a blockhead blindly self-satisfied,
a dullard, easily deluded, a fool readily
adandoned and left, so intolerable that
not all- his money, nor his
houses, nor his carriages could make
it -worth while even to, go* on with the
easy task of deceiving, him.- He was
not worth deceiving any more; It was
s!mpler to be rid of him. In the eyes
of the world that fact would be very
significant of what he was. And that
same thing he was in his own eyes
now. The stroke of this sharp sword
had qloven In .two the armor of his
pride; it. fell off him . and left him
naked. â¢â¢ â¢
Could he endure this fate for all his
life? It would last all his life; peo
ple have long memories and the tradi
tion does not die. It would not die
even with hi j life. No, by heaven, it
v/Quld not! A new thought seized him.
There was the boy to whom he* had
given life. What had hs given to the
boy now? What a father would the
boy have to own? And what of the
boy's mother? The story would last
the boy's life, too. It would always be
between him and the boy. And the
boy would never dare speak of his
mother. The boy would be kept In
ignorance till ignorance yielded, . per
force, to shame. His son's life would
be bitterness to him, If It meant that â
and bitterness surely to the boy, too.
As he brooded on this his face set Into
stiffness. He declared that it was not
to be endured.
He came to where Milldean road
joined the main road by tha red villa
and turned to tha right toward Fair
haven. Here he met the full force of
the gale. The wind was like a moving,
rushing wall; the rain seemed .to hit
him viclously'wlth whips; there was a
great confused roar from the sea be
low the cliffs. He could hardly make
headway or Induce his horsa to breast
the angry tempest. But his , face was
firm, his hand steady and his air reso
lute as he rode down to Fairhaven,
sore in the eyes, dripping wet, cold to
the very bone. His purpose was form
ed. Fool ho might be, but ha was no
coward. He had been deluded, he was
not beatan. His old persistence cams
to his rescue. All through, though he
might have lost everything else, he
had never lost courage. . And now,
when his prlda fell from him, and his
spirit tasted a bitterness aa though 'of
death, his courage rose high in him â a
desperate courage which, feared noth
ing save ridicule and shame. These he
would not have, neither for himself
nor for his boy. His purpose â  was
taken and he roda on. His pride was
broken, but no man was to behold its
fall. In this hour he asked one thing
from himself â courage unfearing; un
flinching. It was his, and he rode for
â \vard to the proofs of it. And there
came In him- a better pride. In place
of self-complacency there was forti
tude; yet it was the fortitude of de
fiance, not of self-knowledge.
He rode through the gale into Fair
haven, thinking nothing: of Mrs. Val
entine's house, waiting on fate to show
him the way. Just where the town
begins, the road comes down to the
sea and runs along by the harbor,
where a seawall skirts deep water. .A
re<an enveloped In oilskins stood here,
glistening through the darkness in the
light of a gas lamp. He- was looking
out' to. sea, out on the tumble of angry
waves, stamping his feet and blowing
0:1 his wet fingers now 1 and then. It
was no night for an Idle man to be
abroad, he who was out to-night had
business. * '
"Rough weather!" called Grantley,
bringing his horse to a stand.
The man answered, not in the ac
cents of the neighborhood, but with a
Cockney twang and a turn of speech
learned from board schools and news-'
papers.* He was probably a seaman
then, and from London.
â¢'"Terribly severe," he said. ".No
night to keÂ£p a man on the lookout."
He looked at Grantley, evidently not
knowing him. ,
"A bad night for a rJde, too, sir."
he added; "but it's better to be mov
ing than standing here, idbRing for a
boat that's as likely to come as the
channel squadron!" He spat scorn
fully as he ended. '
"Looking for a boat?".
For the moment Grantley was glad to
talk; it was a relief. Besides he did
not know what he was going, to do, and
caught a brief respite from decision.
"Aye," the man grumbled, "a boat to
come from Portsmouth. Best luck for
her if she's never started and next best
if she's pub In for shelter on the way.
She'd never make Fairhaven to : night."
"Then what's the good of looking for
her?" y â¢
"Because I get five" shillings for it.
The owner's waiting for, her â waiting
at the Sailors' Rest there." He pointed
to the inn a hundred yards away. "She
was to have been here by midday, and
he's in a hurry. Best for him if she
doesn't come, if he means to sail to
night, as he says he does." He paused
and spat again. "Pretty weather for
a lady to go to sea, ain't it?" he added
sarcastically.
The fates were with Grantley Imason.
They sent guidance.
"What boat Is it?" he asked quietly.
"The Ariadne" (Hairy. Adny. he pro
nounced the name).
"Ah, yes, Mn Blake's yacht?" '
"You know him. sir?. Well, you'll
find him: and his lady at the 'Rest*
there, and if you're . a friend â . of ; theirs
you tell 'em not to expect her. to r night,
and not to go on board her if she
comes." .
"Here's another shilling for you, and
good-night." '",-'. .
Grantley strode on to the Inn, thank-
Ing fate; realizing now how narrow the
chance had been. But for the storm,
but for the wind that had buffeted and
almost beaten him, no pride, no reso
lution, would have been of any avail.
With fair weather the yacht would
have come and gone. He saw why
Christine Fanshaw was not to deliver
his letter till the morrow. Without the
storm, no pride, no resolution, no cour
age would have availed him. The
Ariadne' would have put to sea, and
Sibylla would have been gone forever.
Now, thanks to fate, she was not gone.
Grantley drew a long breathâ the
breath of a man whom a great peril
has narrowly passed by. The plan had
been .laid well, but the storm had
thwarted It. There was time yet.
Was there? That question could not
but rise In his mind. He faced it fairly
and squarely, and jogged on to the
Sailors Rest.
"Praise to this fine storm!" he cried
within himselfâ to the storm which
beat and raged, which- had feigned to
hinder. his coming, but was his ally and
friend. Good luck to it! It had served
his turn as nothing else could. And
how it was attuned to his moodâ to the
fierce stern conflict which he had to
wage! This was no night for gentle
ness. There were nights when nature's
gentleness mocked the strife to which
her own decrees condemned the race of
men. But to-night she herself was In
the fight. ShÂ« Incited, she cheered, she
played him on; and she had given him
his field of battle. He was arrayed for
the fight. Ho drank in the violent salt
air as though It wera a potion magic in
power. His being -tingled for the
struggle.
There was a light In an upper win
dow of the Sailors' Rest. The blinds
wert not drawn. No, the pair in that
room were looking out to sea, looking
for the boat which did not come, look
ing In vain over the tumbling riot of
waves. But stay! Perhaps they looked
no more now; perhaps they had aban
doned that hope for the night. Chris
tine was not to deliver his letter till
the morrow; they would think that
they had to-night. The thought
brought back his pain and his
fierceness. They would think that
they had to-night! They were
wrong . there; but it was ten
o'clock. "Ten o'clock!" he muttered, as
he drew rein at the door of the Sailors'
Rest and cast his eyes up to the light
In the window over his head.
Within, young Blake was turning
away from the window. '
"She won't come to-night." he said.
"I suppose they started, or I should
have had a wire. . They must have put
back, or put In for shelter somewhere.
And if she did come I couldn't take
you to sea to-night." He came across
to where Sibylla sat over the fire. "It's
no use expecting her to-night. We
must get away to-morrow morning.
There's plenty of time." He meant
time'before Grantley Imason would re
ceive Sihjylla's letter and come to Fair
haven, seeking" his wife.
"It's too perverse," Sibylla mur
mured forlornly.
Her vision of their flight was gone.
The rush through the waves, the whis
tling wind, the headlong course, the
recklessness, the remoteness from all
the world, the stir, the movement, the
excitement â all were gone. On the
yacht, out in mid-sea, no land in
sight, making for a new world, they
two alone, with all that .belonged to
the old life out of view and out of
thoughtâ the picture had caught and
filled her fancy. In her dream the sea
had been as Lethe, the stretch of wa
ters a flood submerging all the past
and burying the homes- of memory.
She had stood arm In arm with him,
revelins in the riot of the open seas.
No further had the vision* gone. The
room in the inn was very different. It
was small, stuffy and not too clean.
The smell of stale tobacco and of dregs
of' liquor hung about it. The . fire
smoked, sending out every now and
then a thick dirty cloud that settled
on her hands and hair. Her dainty
cleanliness rose in revolt. It was a
sordid little room. It was odious then;
it would never, be pleasant in retro
spect. Somehow it carried a taint with
Jt; it brought into prominence all that
her ..thoughts had forgotten; its four
â¢dingy walls shut out the glowing pic
ture-which her, fancy had painted.
Blake came and . stopd behind her
chair, laying his hand on her shoulder.
She looked up at him with a sad smile.
"Nothing's quite what you expect,"
she said. "I wanted my voyage! I
suppose I didn't want â reality! But
I'm not a child, Walter. I have cour
age. This makes no difference really."
"Of course it doesn't â so long as
we're together." .
"I didn't come to you to make the
good times better, but to make the bad
times goodâ to do away with the bad
times. That's ' what you wanted me
for; that's what I wanted to do." She
rose and faced him. "So I'll always
welcome trouble â because then I'm
wanted, then I can do what I've come
to do."
"Don't talk about trouble, Sibylla.
We're going to be very happy."
'â¢Yes. I think so," she said, looking
at him with thoughtful eyes. "I think
we shall be." -V,.
"By God, I love you so!" he burst
out suddenly, and then walked off to
the window again. *
She. spread out her hands In an In
stinctive gesture of deprecation, but
her smile was happy.
"That's how. I c*.n do what I , want
to do for you," she said. "That's how
I can change your life, andâ and flnd
something to do with mine."
He came slowly back toward fcer,
speaking in a low restrained voice:
"It's really no use waiting for the
boat. She won't come."
Sibylla stood very still; her eyes
were fixed on his face. He met her
gaze for a moment, then turned away,
sat down by the table and lit a clp
aretteâdoing It Just by habit and be
cause he was so restless, not because
he wanted to smoke.
She stood there in silence for two
or three minutes. Once she shuddered
Just perceptibly. She was striving to
yield, to do what he asked, to live up
to her gospel of giving everything so
that she might make^iappy him whom
Bhe -had chosen to receive her gifts
might make him happy, and so fill, en
rich, and ennoble his life and hers. She
had not thought there would be a
struggle; that had got left out In the
visions â the visions which were full of
the swish of the wind, and dance of
the waves, and the sailing to worlds
new and beautlfuL What struggled?
Old teachings, old habits, instincts In
grained. She was acting In obedience
to ideas, not to feeling. And feeling
alone has power to blot such things out
of beinier.
But for good and evil she was a fa
naticâshe owned her Ideas as masters.
and forced herself to bend to them as
a slave. What they asked must be
givenâ whatever the sacrifice, thrt
struggle, the repulsion. That they
might realize what her nature craved,
they must be propitiated by what her
nature did not love. On that condition
alone would they deal with her. and
now these ideas, with all their exacting
relentless claims, had found embodi
ment In Walter Blake.
Blake turned his head and looked at
her. She came quickly to him and fell
on her knees by him. His hand rest
ed on the table, and she laid hers
lightly on it.
"Walter, it's hard!"
"If you love me " he murmured.
She knew by now that !ove can be
unmerciful. With a little sigh she
raised his hand and kissed It. Sha
was half reconciled to her surrender
because she hated It. Had any one
been there to interpose and forbid, her
reluctant acceptance would have been
turned into an ardent desire to com
plete her sacrifice.
Young Blake flung away his cigarette
and sprang to his feet. He was not
thinking of his aspirations now. Want-
Ing to be good was not present to his
mind, nor the leading of a new life.
He was full of triumph. He forgot the
yacht that had not come, and any
thing there might be uncongenial In
the surroundings. He caught Sibyl
la's hands. She looked at him with a
smile half of wonder, half of pity. She
had put away her shrinking â though it
might come back; but It was a little
strange that good could be done only
on conditions.
They were standing thus when they
heard a voice, the loud gruff voice be
luning to the retired merchant-skipper
who kept the inn. He was rather a
rough customer, as Indeed the quality
of his patrons rendered necessary; he
did not hesitate to throw a man out
or (as Fairhaven report averred) to
lay a stick across the back of the
saucy buxom daughter who served the
bar for him If her sauclness became too
pronounced. On the whole he was the
sort of character popular In the nau
tical quarter of Fairhaven.
The loud voice came from a distance
âfrom the bdttom of the stairs ap
parently. The landlord was talking to
himself, for all that appeared â no other
voice made Itself heard. He was say
ing that he had made a promise, and
that he was a man of his word. ' He
said this several times. Blake and Si
bylla stood hand in hand, their eyes
turned in the direction of the door.
Then the landlord observed that "times
were hard, and that he was a poor
man." Blake and Sibylla heard that,
too. Then the landlord's heavy step
came halfway up the stairs. "A poor
man," they heard him say with strong
emphasis. Still they could hear no
other voice and no other step. But
they had dropped one another's hands
by now, and stood quite still a couple
of paces apart.
*"Oh, he's bargaining with some
body for the price of a bed I" said
young Blake with an attempt at light
ness.
The landlord's steps were heard de
scending the stairs again. And now
another step drew near.
Suddenly young Blake darted to
ward the door and locked ft. He turn
ed a scared face round to Sibylla. The
steps sounded along the passage. His
eyes met hers. He did not know the
step, but he knew the one thins that
he feared and his uneasy mind flew
to the apprehension of it.
"Can it be â anybody?" he whis
pered.
"It's Grantley." she answered quiet
ly. ";â _ "Unlock the door. I'm not afraid
to meet him. In the end I believe I'm
glad."
"No, no! You're mad! You mustn't
see him. I'll see him. You go into
the other room." There was a com
municating door which led to a bed
room. "I'll not let him come near
you. I'll stand between " you and
him."
"I must see him. I'm not afraid
"Walter. Unlock the door."
"Oh. but I shan't let him come In
I shall "
â¢If it's Grantlev he'll come In. Un
lock the door. At any rate we can't
have the door broken In."
She smiled a little as she said thisand then sat down In -the chair by the
table where Blake had been sitting
when she kissed his hand and gave
him her surrender.
A knock came on the door. Young
Blake unlocked it and stood opposite
it. His face w^s pale now.
"He shan't come near you," he
whispered to Sibylla aver his shoul
der.
She made no sign. She sat resting
her clasped hands on the table and
gazing intently toward the door.
There was no sign of confusion or of
guilt about her. Her face was com
posed and calm. Y.oung Blake's flst3
were clenched. He seemed to keep
himself still with an effort.
The door opened and Grantley ap
peared on the threshold. He was very
wet; the rain dripped from his hat as
he took it off his head; salt spray
hung on the hair over his ears. He
shook himself as he shut the door be
hind him. Then he looked from Si
bylla to Blake and back to Sibylla, at
last fixing his eyes on her.
"You can't come in here," said
Blake. "I'll come outside with you
if you like, but you can't come in
here.". 'â:-,
Grantley took no notice. His eyes
wer#> on Sibylla.
'flLm I too late. Sibylla?" he asked.
"Yes," she answered tranquilly,
"too late." *
A sudden flush swept over Grant
ley's face, but In an instant his usual
pallor had returned.
"In the sense in which I spoke Is
that true. Sibylla?"
She shrugged her shoulders a little.
She seemed composed and almost
careless as she answered with a touch
of contempt:
"No; but It Is true, for all that."
The Upper nnd the Nether Stone.
"Then you must come back with me,"
said Grantley.
Young Blake sprang forward a step,
crying: "By God, no!"
Neither of them heeded him: their
eyes were on one another. Already the
fight was between the two, and the two
only.
"Do you really think that?" she ask
ed. "I don't know how you come to
be here â I suppose Christine warned
you somehow; but it's by mere acci
dent you are here, and that I haven't
gone before now. It makes no differ
ence. You're not In time, as you call
it. The thing is settled already; it was
settled when I planned to come, not
when I came. What you meant doesn't
count. Do you really think I shall
come back now?"
"Yes. you must come back now."
"Back to that life? Never! Of course
you don't know what it was to me and
I don't suppose I could tell you. You
wouldn't understand."
Blake threw himself Into a chair by
the window. He was helplessly impa
tient of the situation. Grantley came
a little nearer the table and stood
there, to all seeming impassive. The
appearance was not very deceptive. He
was not now dominated by emotion;
he was possessed bv a resolve. His
love for his wife was far burled In his
[ 'â ' ' '" "'" : ;^i â ;'â .:?:'â ' '.>o' f 'TW-- .' â -. -.\- r -<-- V-5-r â ".â â¢â  ' â  'â """" - â  â " â 
heart; his set purpose was all he knew.
"I don't see what you had to com
plain of." he said coldly. "The way
â¢ve lived was vour choice, not mine.
But I'm not going to discuss that. I'm
here to take you home to your hus
band's house and to your child."
"I've faced all that a thousand times
and answered it a thousand times. It
can't move me now. You'd better go
away, Grantley."
Again Blake rose: he did not lack
physical courage.
"I'll eo with you. I'm at your ser
vice." he said. "But outside; you
shan't stay here.".
He waited a moment for an answer,
but getting none, nor so much as a
look, sank awkwardly into his seat
again.
Grantley spoke to his wife.
"I know what happened. Before you
did this you fogged your mind with all
sorts of fantastic ideas. You're not
the woman to do this kind of thing
easily."
"Fantastic Ideas! Yes, they'd seem
bo to vou. The fantastic idea of hav
ing something to live for. some life,
something else than a prison, than re
pression, than coldness. I had lots of
those fantastic ideas. Grantley."
"You had your child."
"I tell you I've faced It." She pressed
her fingers card into her cheek and
frowned. "The child made it worse."
she Jerked out fiercely. "Seeing you
with the child was â " She shook her
head with a shiver.
Grantley raised his eyebrows.
"As bad as that?" he asked mock
ingly. He paused, and went on: "But
this is all beside. the point. Supposing
It was as bad as you say, what then?
You had made your bargain; you chose
to take me: you relied on your own
opinion. Say it was a mistaken opin
ion â what difference does that make?"
"It does make a difference. I'm not
called upon to throw away every
chance of happiness because of one
mistake."
"That's Just what you are called
npon to do â In civilized society."
"You don't actually propose an ab
stract argument?" she asked. "Now â
under these circumstances?" She
smiled derisively.
"Ofy no! But your point of view
compelled a protest. Tm not here to
argue: I'm here to take you back^-or,
if you won't come, to tell you the con
sequences."
"I'm prepared for the consequences."
That gave young Blake another
chance. He rose and came forward.
"Yes, she is â and so am I," he said;
"and that ought to end the matter be
tween us. We're prepared for the trou
ble and the scandal and all that; and
I'm prepared for anything else you may
think proper to ask. We've weighed
all that, and made up our minds to it.
That's the answer we have to give."
He spoke In a low voice, but very
quickly and with passion; evidently he
had hard work to keep control of him
self. When he finished speaking, there
was a moment's silence. He looked
from Grantley to Sibylla, then went
back to his chair; but he drew it
nearer and listened Intently.
"It is so," said Sibylla. "We've made
up our minds to all that."
Grantley passed his hand across his
browâ almost the first movement that
he had made. He was about to speak
when another short fit of vehemence
caught hold of Sibylla,
"Yes," she cried, striking the table
Tilth her hand, "and It's better than
that life of sham and fraud and failure
CHAPTER XVI.
and heartbreak! Yes, a thousand,
thousand times better!"
He let the gust pass by, and then
spoke slowly, as though he weighed his
words.
"Those are the consequences to you
and your â your friend here," he said.
"Have you thought of the consequences
to me?"
"To you? Am I so necessary?" She
laughed bitterly. -'. ' *Â£.?>?
"And to the boy?"
"Not so bad as growing up in such a
home as ours!" she flashed out fierce
ly again.
"Oh, that's the way you argued
that?" he said with a smile. "I was
rather wondering. -However there are
other consequences still." He came yet
a pace nearer to her. so that he was
close to the table, and rested one hand
on it. "There will be other conse'
quences still," he said. "I don't ac
cept the position you propose for me. I
don't accept these consequences which
you have been so good as to face and
decide upon. I refuse them totally â
both for myself and for my son I re
fuse them utterly. - It's fair you should
understand that. I refuse them root
and branch."
Blake leaned forward, ready to spring
up. The idea of violence came into his
head, the idea that Grantley might be
armed. Grantley noticed his move
ment, and at last addressed a word
to him.
"Don't be afraid. I don't mean that,"
he paid, with a short laugh.
Sibylla spoke to him, sadly now.
"You can't refuse. It's put 1 out of
your power. This thing must be. It
has become inevitable. There's no use'
in talking of refusing the consequences.
They won't be as bad as you think."
"It's not inevitable; it's not out of my
power. It's entirely in my power to
accept your consequences or not to ac
cept them, to face them or not to face
them; and I have decided. I won't be,
and I won',t be known as, what you're
making me; and your son shan't have
to confess you his mother before men."
Young Blake looked at him with a
puzzled impatience, Sibylla with a slow
pandering glance. She twisted a ring
on her finger as she asked:
"What do you mean by that?"
"In this world nothing need happen
to us that we don't choose to bear,
and nothing to those who are In our
power that we don't choose to accept
for them."
"What are you talking about?" asked
Blake fretfully. "It sounds all non
sense to me."
He leaned back with a scornful toss
of his head. This sort of thing had
lasted long enough, in his opinion.
"Tell me what you mean," said Si
bylla, leaning forward across the table.
Grantley announced the resolve that
possessed him. born of those bitter
meditations, of those intolerable pic
tures of the future which had formed
themselves in his mind as he battled
through the storm to Fairhaven. He
uttered it not as .a threat, but as a
warning; it was, as he had said, fair
that she should understand.
"If you persist. I shall kill Frank and
myself to-night." â¢ i
Blake broke into a loud scornful
laugh, sticking his hands In his pock
ets. Grantley turned toward him,
smiling slightly.
"Oh, this isn't a melodrama, you
know," Blake said, "and we're not to
be bluffed like that. Don't be so
damned absurd, Imason! On my soul,
I've had enough of this business with
out having to listen to stuff like that!"
"Do you think it's bluff and melo
drama?" Grantley asked Sibylla. "Do
you think I've no real Intention of do
ing it?"
She looked up at him intently.
"You love yourself more than the
boy, and your pride more than life or
happiness," she said slowly. He
frowned, but heard her without Inter
ruption. "So I think you might do it,"
she ended.
"Sibylla!" cried Blake, leaning for
ward again.
A gesture from her arrested his
speech. He rose slowly to his feet and
stood listening.
"I may be made a fool of. V I don't
make a fool of myself. If I pledge
myself to you to do it, you know I shall
do it, Sibylla?"
"Yes, then you would do It," she
agreed. vi\ â¢ ,
"Oh, but it's nonsense. It's rank mad
ness, it's â It's inconceivable!" Blake
broke out.
"I do now so pledge myself," said
Grantley.
Sibylla nodded; she understood. She
leaned back in her chair now, regard
ing her/^husband thoughtfully. >
Grantley's pale face was set in a
fixed smile; he met her gaze steadily.
"It's madnessâ you'll be stopped!"
Blake burst out. "I can't believe you
mean it. Anyhow, you'll be stopped."
"By you? Will you send for a police
man? Or will you come to my house
and stop me? Nothing can stop me
unless you kill me. Is that your
choice?"
He spoke to Blake, but he looked still
at Sibylla. Blake came near and scru
tinized the pale face with eyes whose
expression grew from wonder and in
credulity Into a horrified apprehension.
The silence now seemed long.
"Yes," said Sibylla at last, "it's like
you. That's what you'd do. I never
thought of it; but I'm not surprised.
It's you. It's Just that In you , which
has made my life an impossible thing.
You sacrificed me to it. You would
sacrifice yourself , and your son. Yes,
It's you."
She put her hands up before her face
for a moment, pressing her fingers on
her eyelids. Then her eyes sought his
face again.
"But, Sibylla " cried Blake.
"Yes, he'd do it, Walter," she inter
rupted, not turning round.
Blake took two restless paces to and
fro and sank Into his chair again.
"You understand now. It lies with
you," said Grantley to his wife. "I've
told you. I was bound to tell you. Now
it lies with you.
Again passion seized' her.
"No, no, that's false! It doesn't lie
with me. It lies at your door, both
the crime-^the hideous crimeâ and, I
pray God, the- punishment!"
"I'm not talking about the crime or
the punishment," he said coldly. "I
take those on myself as much as you
like. What depends on you is whether
the thing happens. "That's all I meant
to say."
Young Blake was staring at hinj now
as if fascinated by his firm and hide
ous resolve. Slowly it had been driven
into Blake's brain that the man meant
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY*, (LA.U:.
what he said, that he would do the
thing. The man looked like it, and Si
bylla believed he would. He would
kill himselfâ yes; and the pretty child
with- whom Sibylla had been used to
play. He could see the picture of that
now â of Sibylla's beautiful motherhood.
His heart turned sick within him as
he began \o believe Grantley's somber
pledge.
"It's a. lie." said Sibylla in grim de
fiance. "Nothing depends on me. It's
the evil of vour own heart. I've noth
ing to do with it."
"It's with you to bring it about or
to prevent it."
"No!" she' cried, rising to her feet
in the agonized strain of her heart â
"No, no! That's a lieâ a lie! On your
head be it! Ah, but perhaps it would
be best for him! God knows, perhaps
it would be best!"
"So I think," said Grantley quietly.
"And you accept that?"
"No, I acknowledge no. responsibility
â not a Jot."
"Well, leave the question of respon
sibility. But it's your will that this
shall happen sooner than that- you
should leave this man?" - ,
" "Sooner than that I should come
back to you, that life of ours begin
again, and Frank grow up to a knowl
edge of It!"
"And it's my. will, sooner than that
he should grow up to a knowledge or
how his mother ended it. , That's set
tled, then?" . V \
"It's no bargain!" she protested
fiercely. "You have settled it."
"But it is settled?" he persisted.
. "If vou do it, may God never par
don you!" â¢. .'â â ./
"Perhaps. But you know that It is
settled?"
She made no answer.
"You can't deny that you know. So
be it." * ' '
He faced her for a moment longer:
her figure swayed a little, but she stood
her ground. She was not beaten down.
And she; knew the thing was settled,
unless by chance, at the last, pity
should enter Grantley's heart. But
she did not believe pity could enter
that heart; he had never shown her
that there was a way.
The smile rested still on Grantley's
face as he regarded his wife. She
looked verv beautiful in her fierce de
fiance, her loathing of him, her pas
sionate protest, her refusal. to be beat
en down, her facing of the thing. She
had a fine spirit; it did not know de
feat or cravenness. She was mad with
her. ideas. Perhaps he was mad with
his. And the ideas clashed â with ruin
to her life and his, and the child's.
But she did not bow her head any
more than he would bend his haughty
neck. : :''"' : -~.
"At least you have courage," he said
to her. "It is settled. And now I'll
say good-by and go. I'll interrupt you
no more."
It was his first taunt of that kind.
It seemed to pass unheeded by Sibylla;
but young Blake's face turned red, and
he clenched his hands; but not in
anger. A wave of horror passed over
him. He would not interrupt longer
what his coming had interrupted â that
was what Grantley Imason meant. He
would leave them to themselves while
he went; back alone to his home, -and
there found the sleeping child. But his
idea of thatâ the picture of the one
house and the other â was too fearful.
How could the two bear to fhink of
that? How could they stand there
and decide on that? It was unnatural,
revolting, alien from humanity. Yet
they meant it. Blake doubted that no
more, and the conviction of it un
manned him. He had been prepared
for scandal, he had been ready to risk
his life. Those things were ordinary;
but this thing was not. Scandal is one
thing; tragedy another. This grim,
unyielding pair of enemies threw trag
edy in his appalled face. It was too
much. A groan burst from his lips.
"My God!" he moaned.
They both turned- and looked at him
âSibylla gravely, Grantley with his
rigid smile. Â»â 
"My God, I can't bear it;" He was
writhing in his chair, as though in
keen bodily pain. "It's too awful! We
âwe should think of it all our lives. : I
should nevjer get rid of it. I should
see the poor little beggar's face! I
can't stand that. I never thought of
anything like that. I never meant any
thing like that. Poor little Frank! My
God, you can't mean it, Imason?"
"You kn<&v I mean it. It's nothing
to you. .The responsibility , is ours.
What do you count for? It was you or
anotherâ that's all. Neither my life
nor my son's is anything to you."
"But it wouldâ it would always be
there. I could never sleep at nights.
I should feel like â like a murderer. For
pity's sake "
. He came toward Grantley, stretching
out his hands for mercy. Grantley
made no sign. Blake turned to Sibylla.
She, too, was stiff and. 'still, but her
eyes rested on him In compassion. He
turned away, and threw himself Into
the chair again. A convulsive move
ment ran through his body, and he
gave a loud sob.
Sibylla" walked slowly away to the
hearthrug, and stood looking at the
agonized young man. Grantley waited
In immovable patience. -The thing was
not finished yet. .' - â --'.
"The horror of It!" Blake" moaned al
most inarticulately. He turned to weak
rage for an Instant and hissed; across
to Grantley: "If I had a revolver, I'd
shoot you where you stand." *
"That would be better for me, but
not better for the boy," said Grantley.
"I can't J understand you," Blake
gasped, almost sobbing again.
"Why should you? My, account Is
not to be rendered to you. If I've
ruined my wife's lifeâ and you've heard
her^ say I have â if I take my. own and
my son's, what is it to* you ?"
In Grantley's * slow measured words
there breathed a great contempt.
What, he seemed to say, were any
great things, any stern issues, to this
unmanned, hysterical creature, who
dressed up his desires in fine clothes,
and let them. beguile him -whither he
knew notÂ» only to start back in feeble
horror at the ruin that he had invited?
What was. it < all to him. or he to Â«it?
It was he or another. The real battle
was still between himself and Sibylla.
With what eyes was she", looking on
this. young man? He turned from the
collapsed figure and faced â  his wife
again.
But her eyes were now on Walter
Blake, with a pleading. , puzzled, pity-
Ine - look. The . next moment r she
walked â¢ quickly across -the room
and knelt down by his side, taking
one of his hands 'in both ' of â¢ hers. v She
began' to whisper consolation to him,
praying" him.aiot to distress himself, to
be calm and brave, tenderly repreoach
lng his lack * of , self-control. She was
with him as Grantley had seen her
with the child." He wondered to .see
that, and his wonder kept his temper
under command. There . did not seem
enough to' make a man's passjon rage
or his jealousy run wild, even though
she whispered close in Blake's ear and
soothingly caressed his hand.
"Don't be so distressed," he heard
her murmur. "It's not your fault,. dear.
Don't be : frightened about it."
He tried to shake her off with a
childish petulance, but she persevered.
Yet she could not calm him. He broke
from her and sprang to his feet, leav
ing her kneeling.
"I can't face it! By God. I can't!"
he cried.
"It will happen," said Grantley Ima
son. "If not to-nightâ if anything pre
vents me to-nightâ still very soon.
You'll hear of it very, soon."
The young man shuddered.
- "The poor little chap â the poor In
nocent little chap!" he muttered
hoarsely. He turned to Grantley. "For
heaven's sake, think again!",/ ,
"It's you who have to think. I have
thought. I've little time for mo"re
thought. You've all your life to think
about itâ air your life with that wom
an, who is the mother of the child."
"Why did you torment him?" broke
out Sibylla angrily.
â. But she rose slowly and drew away
from Blake as she spoke.
Grantley .shrugged his shoulders
scornfully.
"The fellow has no business in an
affair like this." he said. ."He'd better
get back to his flirtations."
"I never thought of anything like
this."
The repetition came from BlakeTIEe
some dull forlorn refrain.
. He put his hand to" his throat and
gulped with a hard dry swallow. He
looked round the room, made for a
table where some whisky stood, and
took a drink of it. Then he half stag
gered back to his chair, and sat down
all in a heap. His limit was reached.
He was crushed between the upper and
the nether stoneâ between^ Grantley's
flinty pride and the ruthless fanaticism
of SibyllsPs ideas. Between them they
would make him, who had wanted to
be good, .who bad had such fine aspira
tions, such high-colored dreams, such
facile emotions, so impulsive a love â
between them they would make -him a
murderer â a murderer'ln his own eyes.
Whatever hands did the deed, to the
end of his days conscience v would cry
out that his were red.
Sibylla sighed. Her eyes were very
mournful. She spoke, as it seemed,
more to herself than to djther of them.
"I wanted to make him happy, and
I've made -him \ very unhappy. I can
do it, but he can't do it. I mustn't ask
it of him. He would never be happy,
I could never make him happy. Even
if I could be happy, he couldn't; it's too
hard for him. I don't \ know what to
do now."
Grantley neither spoke nor moved.
"I've no right to ask it of any man.
Nobody could agree to it, nobody could
endure it. There's misery both ways
now."
She went to Blake, who was sitting in
the apathetic stupor which had follow
ed his raving outburst. Again she
knelt by him and whispered to him
soothingly. At last Grantley spÂ«ke.
"It would be well if we were home
before it's light and the servants up,"
he said..
' She looked across at mm from beside
Blake's knee. She looked long and
searchihgly. His smile was gone; his
manner and air were courteous, how
ever peremptory.. ~ \"S\
"Yes, it would be well," she said. She
rose and came a little way toward him.
"There's no help for it. I can't es
cape from you. I'm bound to you in
bonds I. can't loosen. I've tried. I've
stood at nothing. I wish to heaven I
could! Going back is like going back
to death. But perhaps he's right. Bet
ter my living death than the thing you
meant to do." She paused and ended:
"I'll go back to the child, but I will
not come back to you."
"You give all I've asked," said
Grantley with cold.ooliteness.
She looked round at young Blake
with a pitiful smile.
"It's the only way, my dear. With
this man what he is, it's the only way.
I must leave you alone."
Blake leaned toward her with a pas
sionate cry of pain. She reasoned gent
ly with him. . â¢ .
"But you know "the alternative â
you've heard it. We can't help It.
This man is capable of doing it, and
he would find out a way. I don't see
that we could do anything at all to
stop him. Then when you heard it, it
would be so terrible to you. You'd
hate yourself. Ohi , and, ' my - dear. I
think you'd hate rne! And I couldn't
pe&r that. No, /you must be reason
able. There's no, other way."
Blake hid his face m his hands. He
mado no further effort. He knew that
her words were true.
Sibylla walked into the bedroom,
leaving the two alone. Neither now
moved nor spoke. The storm outside
seemed to have abated,"'for the rain
dashed no- more against the windows,
and the wind was not howling , round
the walls of the house. It was very
still.' Grantley Imason presently be
gan to button his coat, and then to
dust the wet off his hat with his coat
sleeve. ->
â¢ Sibylla came back in her hat and
cloak.
"We must get something to carry
you," said Grantley. "I wonder if we
could raise a cart here!"
"How did you come?" â¢
."I rode over."
"I don't want a cart. I shall walk
beside your horse."
"Impossible! At this time of night!
And such a night!"
"I shall walkâ I must walk. I can't
sit in a cart and- â â¢" i
Her gesture explained the rest. Strug
gling along on foot, she might keep
her wits. Madness lay in sitting and
thinking.
"As you will," said Grantley.
She had begun to draw on her gloves;
but when she looked at Blake she drew
tbem ; quickly, off- again, - and thrust
them - Into a pocket of : her cloak. She
walked past Grantley to Blake, and
took hold of both' his hands. Bending
over him, she kissed him twice.
. "Thank you for having loved me,
Walter," she said. "Good-by.'V â "-..
Flake 'said nothing. He held ner
hands and looked up imploringly in her
face. Then she disengaged herself
from his grasp and turned around to
her husband.
"I'm ready," she said. "Let us *,â¢>."
Grantley bowed slightly, went to the
door, â¢ and opened it for her. She
locked back once at Blake, murmuring:
"For having . loved me, Walter,' and
kissed her hand to him. I i
With no sign of impatience Grantley
waited. Himself he took no n32d of
Blake, but followed Sibylla out of the
rccm in unbroken silence.
When he found himself alone,- young
Blake sprang ' toward the door, giving
a cry like some beast's roar of rage
and disappointment. But his feet car
ried him no more than half way.
Half way was all he ever got.
Then he reeled across . to where
the liquor was, and drank some
more of it. listening the while to the
paces of Grantley's horse. on the stone
flags outside the inn. As they died
away he finished his liquor and got
back into his chair. He sat a moment
in dull vacancy, then his .nerves failed
him utterly and he began to sob help
lessly, like a forsaken frightened child.
As Grantley Imason said, he had no
business in an affair like that.
CHAPTER XVII.
Wandering Wits.
Grantley's pride was eager to raise
its crest_again. It caught at the re
sult of the struggle and claimed it as
a victory, crying out that there was
to be no pointing of scornful fingers,
no chuckles and? winks, no shame open
and before the world. The woman
who walked by his horse was a
pledge to that. He was not to
stand a plain fool and dupe in the eyes
of men. If that thought were not
enough, look at the â¢ figure young
Walter. Blake had cut! Who had
played the man in the fight? Not the
lover, but the husband. Who had won
the day and carried off the prize? The
woman who walked by his horse was
the evidence of that. Who had known
his will and stood by it and got it?
The woman answered that. He bore
her off with him; young Blake was left
alone' in the dingy inn, balked in his
plan, broken in spirit, disappointed of
his desire. ./:>"â¢;
The night was still and clear now.
Broad puddles in the low-lying road
by the sea and the slipperiness of the
chalky hill up to the cliffs witnessed
to the heaviness of the recent down
pour as the flattened bushes in the
house gardens proved the violence of
the tempest. . But all was gone now,
save the sulky Reaving of big rollers.
A clear* moon shone over all. They
met nobody; the. man who had vainly
watched for the yacht had gone home.
Sibylla did not speak. Once or twice
she caressed Rollo, who knew her and
welcomed her. â¢ For the rest she
strudged steadily through the puddles
and v set her feet resolutely to climb
the sticky road. She never looked up
at her companion. The brutality of his
pride rejoiced again to see her thus.
Here was a fine revenge for. her scorn-
ful words, for the audacity with which
she had dared to bring him within an
ace of irremediable shameâ him and
the child she had borne him! She was
well punished. She came back' to him
perforce. Was she weary? Was she
cruelly weary? It was well. â¢ Did she
suffer? It was Just. Woe to the con
quered â his was the victory! Even In
her bodily trial his fierceness found a
barba"ric joy.
But deep within him some mocking
spirit laughed at all this, and would not
let Its jibes be silenced. It derided his
victory, and made bitter fun of his
pranoing triumph. "I'll go back to the
child, but I will not come back to you."
"Going back is like going back to
death." "Thank you for having loved
me, Walter." The mischievous spirit
was apt at remembering and selecting
the phrases which stung sharpest. Was
this triumph? it asked. Was this vic
tory? Had he conquered the woman?
No, neither her body nor her soul. He
had conquered- â young Blake! The
spirit made cheap of that conquest,
and dared Grantley to make much of
it. "Rank blank failure," said .the
spirit with acrid merriment. "And a
lifetime of it before you!" The "world
would not know perhaps, though it can
generally guess. But his heart knew â
and hers. It was a very fine triumph
that â a triumph fine to win against
the woman who had loved him, and
counted her life worth having because
It was hers to give him! Through the
blare of the trumpets of his pride came
this piercing venomous voice. Grant
ley could not but hear. Hearing it, he
hated Sfbylla, and again was glad that
she trudged laboriously and painfully
along the slimy oozing road. The in
stinct of cruelty spoke in him. She had
chosen to trudge. It was her doing.
That was excuse enough. Whatever
the pain and. labor, she hail Tier -way.
Who was to blame for It?
They passed the red villas, and came
where the Mllldean road branched off
to the left at the. highest point of the
downs. From here they looked over
the cliffs that sloped toward'their pre
cipitous fall to the sea. The moon was
on the heaving waters; a broad band
of silver cut the waves In two. Grant
ley brought his horse to a stand, and
looked. At the instant Sibylla fell
against the horse's shoulder and caught
at his mane with her hands, holding
herself up. Rollo turned his head and
nosed her, cloak In a friendly fashion.
A stifled sob proclaimed her exhaustion
and defeat. She could wajk no more.
The day had been long, full of strain,
compact of emotion. and struggle; even
despair could inspire no more exertion.
In a moment she would fall there by
the horse's side. Grantley looked down
on her with a frowning face, yet with
a new trrumph. Again she failed;
again'he was'right. ,
' "Of course you couldn't do it! Why
did you try?*' he asked coldly. - "The
result isâ here we are! What are" we to
do now?!'
She made no answer: her clutch on
Rollo'! mane grew more tenacious â
that alone kept her up.) Â»
. "You 'must ride.; I'll get down," he
said surlily. Then, he gave a sudden
laugh. "No, he can carry us bothâ
he's done it once before. Put your feet
on the stirrup hereâ I'll pull you up."
She made nd sign of understanding
his allusion. .He saw that\ she -was
dazed with weariness. He drew her up
and set her behind him, placing her
arm about his waist.
"Take care you don't let go." he
warned her curtly, as he jogged the
horse on again, taking now to the turf,
where the going was better.
Her grasp of his waist was limp.
"Hold on, hold on." he said testily,
."or you'll be slipping oft." Thera waa
no hint of tenderness in his voice.
But Sibylla recked nothing of that
now. With a long-drawn sigh she set
tled herself , In her place. It was so
sweet, to be carried along â Just to be
carried alon g . to sit still and be car
ried along. She tightened her grip on
him, and sighed again In a luxury of
content. let her head fall against
his shoulder, and her eyes closed. She
could think no more and struggle no
more; she fell into the blessed forget
fulness, the embracing repose, of great
fatigue.
The encircling of her arm, the con
tact of her head, the touch of her hair
on his neck moved him with a sudden
shock. Their appeal was no less strong
because it was utterly involuntary, be
cause the will had not part in the sur
render of her wearled-out body. Mem
ory assailed him with a thousand
recollections, and with one above
all. His face set In a. sullen ob
stinate resistance; he would not
hear the voice of his' heart
answering the appeal, saying that
his enemy was also the woman
whom he loved. He moved the horse
into a quicker walk. Then he heard
Sibylla speaking in a faint, drowsy
whisper: "Good Rollo, good Kirllo.
how he carries us both â as easily as if
we were one, Grantley!" She enfled
with another luxurious sigh. It was
followed by a little shiver and a fretful
effort to fold her cloak closer about
her. She was cold. She drew nearer
to him, seeking the warmth of con
tact. "That's a little better." she
murmured in a childish grumbling
voice, and sought more comfortable
resting for her head on his shoulder. -
He knew that her wits wandered, and
that the present was no more present
to her. She was in the past â in the
time when to be near him was her
habit and her* Joy. the natural refuge
she sought, her rest in weariness, the
end of her every journey, when his
arms had been her home. Certainly
her wits must be wandering, or she
would never rest her head on his shoul
der, nor suffer her hair to touch his
neck, nor speak nor sigh like that, nor
deliver herself to his charge and care
in this childish holy contentment.
Wandering wits, and they alone, could
make her do anything of this. So it
was not . to be regarded. How ihould
any sane ' man regard it from the
woman who had forsaken her child
and sought to dishonor her home â
whom he had but just torn from the
arms of a lover?
He was afraid. Hence came his usm
moning of the hardest thoughts, his re
sort to the cruelest names. He braced
himself to disregard the appeal she
made, to recall nothing of all that her
'ntlmate presence thrust upon his
mind. He would not be carried back
across the gulf of the last year, across
the chasm which those months had
rent between them. For here was no
'such willing submission as he asked.
It was all unconscious; It left her re-
bellion unquelled and her crime unex
piated. Yet he waited fearfully to hear
her voice again. Whither would the
errant vits next carry her? Whither
must they carry her? He seemed to
be able to answer that question in one
way only. They must go right back to
the beginning. With a sense of list
ening to Inevitable words, he hear her
soft, drowsy whisper again:
"Let's ride straight - into the gold,
Grantley, straight into the gold, and
let the goldâ"
The faint, happy murmur died away
in a sigh, and her head, which had leen
raised a moment, nestled on his shoul
der againJ^SflCSEj
It had come^-the supreme touch of
irony whichy?e had foreseen and dread
ed. The ercsjit wits had overleaped the
stupendous igulf; they crimsoned the
cold rays of the moon into the glory
of" summer sunset; they colored
desolate ruins with the gleaming hues
of splendid youth. Her soul was again
in the fairy ride â the fairy ride which
had led whither? Which had led to
this! Nothing thqt waking wits, or an
ingenuity pointed by malice, ' might
have devised, could have equaled this.
She might have searched all her
armory in vain for so keen a weapon.
Nay, she would have rejected this, the
sharpest of all; no human being could
have used it knowingly. It would have
been too cruel. He listened in dull
terror for a repetition of the words.
They had not come again. What
need? He heard them stlH and a
groan broke the seal of his lips.
"My God, must she do that?" he
muttered to himself. "Get on, Rollo,
get on!"
For now i the triumph faded away,
the unsubstantial pageant was no
more. There was no blare of trum
pets to . deaden the mocking voice.
The little victory stood in its con
temptible dwarnshness beside the
magnitude of his great defeat. That
the past had been, that the present
was â that was enough. The fairy ridÂ©
and the struggle in the Innâ they stood
side by side and bade him gaze on the
spectacle. Beside this It seemed as
though' he had suffered nothing that
day or night â nothing in the thought
of ridicule, and shame, nothing In the
Jealousy and anger of a forsaken man.
This thing alone seemed to matter â
that the past had* been that, and that
the present was this, and that they
had been so shaped in the hand of
him, the fashioner of them.
Then suddenly, with a quick twist
of thought, he was bitterly sorry for
Sibylla, because words and memories
which come back like, that, unbidden
and of themselves, when the wits are
wandering, must have, meant a great
deal and had a great. place once. At
such a time the mind would not throw
up trifles out of an unconscious recol
lection. The things which have been
deepest In it, which have filled â yes.
and formed it â those were the things
that it would throw up. In themselves
they might sound wild trifles, but they
were knit to great deep things, toward

[Continned Xext Snnday.]THE SUNDAY CALL'S $50.00 A WEEK PRIZE STORY
THE ADOPTION OF LITTLE
BELL.
fT*jHE fact was. the people of Fid
i dletown knew nothing at all of
Little Bell's antecedents. Old Pot
ter had found her one August
morning between his cabin and the
spring. She was lying warmly swaddled
in two blankets beside \a still smoking
campflre. The dew was heavy upon the
grass and flowers among which she lay,
and, to use his words, "when she
opened her eyes they were so clear and
blue you could hardly tell 'em from the
little blue bells that grew around her.
That's why I called her Little Bell, you
know." Then he would laugh and pat
jLittle Bell's golden curls, for she was
seldom beyond bis reach as he worked
Jon his cobbler's seat driving great hob
yialls in soVe cumbersome boot sole of
tbe miners.
When the news spread that August
morning that old Potter had found a
baby there was a flurry of excitement
among the women. By twos and threes
they congregated at the cobbler's, till
Potter and his wife wondered at the
multitude. They asked a thousand
questions, scrutinized the little one's
clothing, admired its eyes and after a
general gossip departed. Most of the
members of the W. C. C. C. were there
â Mrs. Thompson, the president: Mrs.
Dillon, the chairman of the standing
committee; the banker's and the hard
ware man's wife, respectfully, con
ferred as to Little Bell's future.
"It seems a sweet child," said Mrs.
Dillon. "Were it not that I had my
hands full with my two I'd adopt it.
But Potter and his wife are morally
good people, so I've heard Mr. Dillon
say."
"Had I not my Rose I would surely
accept the charge. It must be about
the same age â six months old. Oh, dear,
just think of my baby an outcast! How
wretchedly unfeeling and inhuman
tome people are!" said Mrs. Thompson.
"We might call a meeting," suggest
ed Mrs. Dillon.
When Mrs. Dillon spoke to her hus
band of the child he said: "I suppose
the Women's Creedless Charity Club
will call a special meeting. No doubt
one of its members will adopt tbe child.
It would entail a hardship on that old
couple â an act of charity truly."
"Who would adopt it?" ventured Mrs.
Dillon at last.
"Among the club members I think a
suitable home might be found. There's
yourself."
"Oh my, George. Just thinkâ with my
two you surely could notâ"
"Oh. well, there's Mrs. Thompson, the
president I believe. Their means would
allow them â "
"I hinted as much to Mrs. Thompson,
butâ" She paused and Mr. Dillon
picked up the evening paper rather
abruptly, muttering something about
clubs and charity, while Mrs. Dillon
looked flurried and left the room.
The special meeting was not called,
and bo it was that Little Bell remained
with the Potters. ' â¢.
To that aged couple It seemed an an
gel had come to lighten their lives.
That first night they stood hand ii\
hand before the wooden rocker that
had lain away in the garret bo long
unused and gazed at the tiny form
sleeping therein and could not repress
their feelings. "It seems but yester
day, Amos," said his wife. "Aye, it
seems; but we know it has been most
a lifetime." "We'll keep her, though,
Amos; none seem to want her." "That
v.e will/' answered the old man. "She'll

The old lady brought to light Ion?
unused dresses and with her stiffened
fingers laboriously fashioned dresses
and gowns for Little Bell. The old
man, in great glee, would hold her in
his arms at meantime, feeding and
stuffing till the little one would well
nigh choke, heeding not the old lady's
arguments as to the rightful method
of procedure. Not unlike two children
with a doll were they. She Rrew so
fast and was eo bright that the few
that stopped at the cobbler's marveled.
In six months the story of the waif
had lapsed from the memory of al
most all. It was never mentioned at
the W. C. C. C. meetings. Why should
it be" "All knew little Bell had a
home; that the Potters were moral
ly goodâ every one said so. However,
they were poor, but they were happy â
oh. so happy, those old people!
Passers-by w-ould stop and admire
and pet the child as they said, "What
a pretty grandchild!" The old man
would smile and chuckle, "Grandchild?
Why, it is our childâ mine and the old
woman's. No one else has any claim
on her."
Three years passed away thus when,
in tho fading summer, the aged part
ner of Amos passed away. Upon the
evergreen knoll overlooking the town
they laid her. Again Little Bell came
Into the notice of the public eye.
"I wonder what Potter will, do now?"
queried Mrs. Dillon of her husband.
"Do?" he answered. "Has not his
wife been an invalid for two years?
His cares will be less, if anything."
"He certainly cannot care for that
child alone," she continued.

said Mr. Dillion emphatically. "With

"As chairman I have been requested

returned the old man, but the mem
bers were persistent. On several occa

their homes. Sometimes the old man
consented, but always with great re
luctance, and when he came for her
even the most sanguine of the commit

of separating the two. but still they
persevered. The day fcerore Thanks

She is fast becoming of that age where
her environments should be changed
to those more natural and congenial;

It is, but you can readily see, if you
pause and consider, that we are right;

she will be better off in every respect."
One of the committee said afterward
that lt was hard to face the cHd man
when he at last fully understood them.
His hand trembled as he ran lt over
his thin locks.
"You want, to take Little Bell from
me?" he faltered.
.VShe will be near, Mr. Potterâ it is
with Mrs. Thompson, you know. She
has lost her little oneâ it will be a
grand home for Little Bell."
"For three years an' over I've cared
for little Bell, even when she was a
baby an* could hardly eat. You were
all here when she came; none offered
to help then â she was cute then, but
considerable of a care* I cared for
her â nursed her when sick an' taught
her to do right as she grew. Now she
seems my own child. An* Mrs. Thomp
son, she was here three years ago â why
didn't she -want her then? Why, cause
she had one, but now she wants mine â
'taln't rightâ 'tain't right," walled the
old man.
"Come here. Little Bell." The child,
who had been watching the old man in
open-eyed wonder, dropped her rag doll
and ran Into his outstretched arms.
"Pap-pee, don't cry; me's a good
girl." The old man strained her to his
breast, the women were silent. Mrs.
Dillon, who sat in the background,
could not keep back the tears.
"You say you are sent," continued the
old man, becoming calmer and releas
ing the little one. "Who sent you?"
"We're a committee of the W. C. C. C.
It has been fully discussed In meeting
and all are cognizant of our efforts In
this case. Consider, It's for the child's
good, Mr. Potter."
"I suppose you could take her any
wayâI mean the law," said he faintly.
"Oh, we do not wish to take those
means. Mr. Potter. The change should
be made amicably."
"I suppose you're rightâ maybe you
are, but It about kills me," and he
brushed his eyes hastily. "I suppose it
Is for her good. Come here. Little Bell.
Kiss me. There, you is going with the
ladiesâ I'll come by and by. Take your
dolly." He kissed her and turned away
to the fireplace and sat heavily .down.
There was a hurried rustling of skirts,
the door gently closed and all was si
lent. The committee had gone, with
them Little Bell.
What a Thanksgiving for old Potter!
For an hour he sat with bowed head,
finally he arose and groping his way to
the door he threw It wide. A gentle
breeze was moving up tho great gulch
from the far-off valley. The vine on
the arbor before tho door was just be
ginning to change to a ruddy, golden
color, and here and there among the
deep foliage, still safe from the falling
eyes of the old man, hung several clus
ters of the red tokay. Darkness shut
ting from view tho surrounding hills,
he turned and moved mechanically to
tho table and lit the stub of candle that
remained in the socket. For a time he
stood undecided in the center of the
room; then he began moving about,
aimlessly at first, but finally as though
in search of something, his gray locks
moving this way and that as he passed
from corner to corner of the room. At
last he stopped before the wooden rock
er, brushed hla hand wearily across his
eyes as though to control his weaken
ing senses, and sat down. Drawing the
rocker to the fireplace, with his foot he
gently rocked lt, cooing a lullaby the
while.
Hours passed, the room grew cold.
Several times he arose and peered into
the cradle as though to reassure hlzn-

hand over his heart. Then the rocker
ceased its vibrations, the candle sput

minute blue flame and died out. All

' But of Little Bell. "What a time of
rejoicing when the committee reached
the president's house. Mrs. Thompson
cried over her at first, for she did but
remind her of the dear one gone. They
petted and fondled, Little Bell and load
ed her with presents â one, a gTeat wax
doll, but through it all Little Bell look
ed on wonderingly, never once letting
go of the rag doll, whose arms and legs
"Pappee" had filled with sawdust. Onct>
or twice she pursed her lips as though
she would cry, and to their words of
affection only answered, "Me wants
pappee, me wants pappee."
The great house, the bright Ilght3
and the pictures awed her and filled
her with a mute wonder. By and by
her eyelids became heavy and her head
drooped wearily. Then they came and
caressed her again and Mrs. Thompson
bore her away to a little white bed, in
which she tucked her. There wero
tears in the good lady's eyes, as she
gazed at the curls on the pillow; there
were tears in Little Bell's eyes, too, aa
she murmu^d under her breath, "Pap
pee."
The house became dtlll. but Little
Bell was awake now. Once sho heard
footsteps and she raised herself to lis
ten. "Pappee!" she whispered, but
there was no answer and the footsteps
died away. A wild desire came into
Little Bell's mind; she would go horns
to pappee. Slipping from her cozy bed
and grasping her rag doll, which sho
had kept near her, she stole toward the
door, some instinct telling her to go
gently. "Who were these peoplo and
why did not Pappee come for her?"
she thought. The door was ajar, and
noiselessly she passed out Into tho
large room. There she paused, looking
around her in the darkness. Cautious
ly she felt her way toward a faint
light that seemed far ahead. Out of tho
large room and into a smaller sho
passed, where the air felt warmer and
the odor of the red apples she had seen
filled the air. The light before her now
was near. It was from the glass door
that led out â out where Pappee was.
She could just reach the knob with her
little fat hands by standing on tiptoe.
Time and again she rested, breathing
hard. At last open Lt came, and sho
hardly stifled a cry as she grasped tho
doll and ran out into the night. For a
moment she glanced around. Faintly
In the starlight gleamed the pathway
down the hill; she knew it well. Once
she turned her eyes heavenward, but
the twinkling multitudes confused her.
Down the hill she hurried, falling sev
eral times, and her white gown, with
its beautiful lacea, became black with
dust, but never once did she loose her
grasp upon the rag doll. As she reach
ed the highway the moon topped the
distant peaks and all became bright.
Now, again, she paused; which way
would she turn? To the left was tho
main street of tbe townâ surely she
would be seen, for although late, there
were still loungers around the open
cafes; to the light was Potter's cabin,
nearly half a mile away besida the
road. She turned toward Potter's. The
hoot of an owl far away in the hills
made her gasp and hurry onward, then
a rabbit ran along before her in tha
dust, but she laughed at that, for had
not she and Pappee watched them play
near the cabin! At last she saw thu
dark foliage of the pear trees that sur
rounded the cabin. She shouted with
glee as she crawled beneath the gate
and wearily dragged herself to the
door. "Pappee!" she called, but no an
swer came from within.
"Pappee! pappee! It's Little BelL 1*3
come home!"
But only the gentle rustling of the
leaves overhead answered her. 'Round
the dark room she felt her way. call
ing ever and again endearing words to
pappee, till she felt his silent form
sitting in the great chair.
â¢Pappee's alseep!" she cried, as she
crawled hastily into his lap, caressing
and fondling him. She nestled down
In his lap, the weary eyelids drooped
and soon the gentle breathing told that
she slept.
Thanksgiving day dawned upon Fid*
dletown. All the shops were closed t
\\ W^fÂ», a day of rest and SÂ°Â°d cheer.
Mr. Dillon rose early. "George," said
Ms wife, as she placed tho turkey in
the oven, "I appoint you a commlttea
of one to so to Amos Potter and bring
him home to dinner; he's lonesome I
know. He can stay all day. You say
he did you many a kindness when you
wero young." *
Mr. Dillon knew nothing as yet ot

the courage to tell him. The measures
adopted had left a pangâ but pshaw!
the men could talk it over. They would
understand. Â»
Mr. Dillon walked quickly through
the village. Few were astir, yet he
knew old Amos would be up and about.
As he passed the Thompson homo ha

u sad picture, th-e passing of the farm,
the dis?iintegration of a family, the
blighting of a thousand memories that
cluster about a hearthstone. At such
a time the squeaky voice of ready

awing the modest aspiration of a neigh

when ready money seems determined,
the promissory notes of the modest fall

Lim Jucklin outbid Stoveall and became
possessed of a pile of old books heaped
on the floor, gome of his friends mar
veled that he should have run the risk
of exciting the opposition of the wealth
iest man in the community.
"Oh, I knew that he didn't want 'em,"
said Lim, as he climbed to a seat uuon
the rail fence, a low but' estimative
throne of observation. "In his house
they would be Just bo much rubbish.
They don't talk to him. and when a
book don't speak to a man It is the
dumbest thing in the world. It can't
make as much noise as a pig. for a pig
squeals; quieter than a duck, for a duck
quacks â it simply takes its place alone
with the brickbat or the old shoe-sole
that curls up in the sun. But when a
book even whispers to a man It tells
him the sweetest of secrets. It tells
him that he ain't a blamed fool, and
this Is a mighty important piece of
news. "Whenever I see an old book I
think of Abe Lincoln. He gathered
corn for two days, keepin' up the down

men that have humped yourselves all

means. He was lendin' his body to the
work of openin' up his soul. It come
hard, that book did; it meant backache,

down to the ground, but it meant more
than If he had been workin' for $100

that every man that thinks bo much
of a book will be great: he may never
be able to go to a Bale such as this and
buy a yoke of steers, but In the long
run it will be worth more to him than
all the steers that Old Elisha was a
plowln' when the call came for him to
go up."

TENDER CORNS
By Kate Thyson Marr.
Feminine curiosity is often responsi

woman who Is estranged from her fam

meeting: mutual friends who will pelt
her with inquisitive cross-questionings,
albeit well-meaning, simply- because

A proud, sensitive woman who finds
It necessary to sever the ties binding
her to matrimony and misery' is at
times forced to be unequivocally rude
in order to protect herself from the in-
quisltions of her dearest friends, and
it is always the dearest friend who
takes the trifling liberty of wounding
and of asking questions that often
one's own mother would not dare pre
sume to do. The right kind of woman
does not ventilate her matrimonal mis
eries and nothing hurts her so deeply
some day. It has always Deen cer
tain that you had to go, and then who
is goin" to take care of the things you
have raked together? Come to think
about It, I don't believe I ever heard
you laugh right good."
"I haven't had anything to laugh
about," the old man replied.
"And nobody else that was always
afraid that he might be robbed while
he laughed. But you have 'been rob
bed out of a mighty few pennies; ever
elrice I can remember you have been
able to go to a sale and buy what you
wanted, and yet of all the men I
know, Stoveall. your life has been the
biggest failure."
"Jucklin, I could buy you and sell
you three times In a day, with' the
price doubled etery time I bought you
back."
"Oh, you mean my land and my
house- Yes, I reckon you could, but
you never saw money enough to buy
me. In lookin* through advertisements

I used to think along your line. I

I owned all the land adjoinin' my farm,
and I was miserable because I saw no
chance of gettin* it. Every day or so
I'd see a hearse goin* "down the road,
haulln' some old fellow to the grave

OWING to a hitch In the pro
gramme, the good people of
Memphis, Tenn.. were not quite
ready for me when I arrived
there on the inside of a train during a
tour of the world in 1SS0. The Mayor
had mlslaJd the key to the city, and the
Iron foundries hoisted the cold wave

boy to raise, and before a week ended
I sassed myself for sidestepping Oma

entree to the whirlpool of social gayety
as portrayed by Polish weddings among
the shop hands. Memphis was chill and
sloppy. All hands turned me down,
and my money sped swiftly, like the

excited to whistle.
When the hope of becoming an em

about the levee and looked at the river.

said he had been bottling wine in Cal
ifornia, helped me look at the river and
the ice, and shared the frosts that nip
ped us in the town.
We met by the river, he and I, and
there was much that bound us together.
Carl was but a detached unit in this
great problem of ours involving 80,000,
000 fatheads, and some that had sub
sided. I knew him little more than a
week under adverse conditions, yet
even now as I gaze upon the restless
push, hustling and striving for the
dollar and the quick, unsatisfying
lunch, I often think of that sad, hun
gry boy alone on the bum until he
met me.
Carl was one of eleven, he told me
in our calmer moments. I, too, had
sprung from poor but prolific parents,
and an unconscious bond of misery
linked the busted wine bottler to me in
a sort of brother stunt. Each was
welcome to what the other didn't have.

We once knew. a man who wasjeon-
Btructed on "the"* enefal lines which we
town Carl's socks' awoke languid in
terest in our movements, and that was
the best we got. Like myself he had
abated his finances, quitting a good
Job for the excitement of hunting an
other in a strange place, and was then
eager to starve to death In a warmer
climate, provided he could reach one.
I coincided in this view, and we pool
ed an issue.
The German comedian roomed under
a high sidewalk in the purlieus of the
city, and took Window Board stand
ing In front of a restaurant that dis
played steaks, chops and delicacies of
the season behind thick glass. I oc
cupied apartments in a river front hos
telry at 15 cents per day,| which did
not include meals. These Southern
cities know how to boom prices to the
embarrassment of Northern tourists.
My 52 bark trunk that had set out
from Mudville with me was at the ho
tel, and I assayed about 51 40 in white
metalâ all that lay between us and the
next town, which we agreed should be
New Orleans. The only tip either of us
had on that place was the distance,
which is said to lend enchantment at
a high rate of interest.
So Carl and I plotted to beat the
river out of. a pass to . New Orleans,
and herein is th^t scheme-laid bare.
For 90 cents I purchased a black tar
paper valise with tin hasps and trim
mings. In size, shape , and - general
trimming this purchase looked more
like a gas meter than anything I can
now recall. Into that valise Ave put a
chunk of bologna sausage bigger than
a bootleg, a bag of raw onions, and
stuffed bread in the remaining space.
My last cent went to victual the cruise
of at least a week. The comedian voted
the bologna into the grip, and I pre
scribed the onions, having read in nau
tical tales that the onion is the best
preventive of scurvy known to mari
ners.
To properly dress for the part, I put
on my shop clothes. Including a blue
flannel shirt, and stowed the rest of
my outfit in the faithful bark trunk.
With the help of Carl I carried the
trunk to an express office and shipped
it C. O. D. to New Orleans.
An immense stern-wheel boatâ the
U.-P. Schenck, from Cincinnatiâ offered
inviting exit to a warmer clime. She
carried furniture on the hurricane
deck, baled hay on the lower or boiler
deck, and nails in kegs In the hold.
Carl and I thought the hay looked
good to us,- so. one evening at dusk,
when no one was looking, we burrowed
into the new mown. A row of stan
chions from the boilers forward car
ried a canvas-covered steam pipe to
the engines aft, and the hay was piled
over -and around the pipe. We crawled
|into this steam heated flat, taking the
food hamper along, and settledvdown
for a nice, quiet voyage.
Things went pretty well until the

sold us out. He had a vulgar habit of

WHEN his pretty little cousin
from New Orleans had mar
ried one of his chums, Tom
' Chester had felt a bit dubious
as to the outcome. Selwyn was a hand
some chap, a spoiled child of fortune,
who in all his life had scarcely felt a
restraining finger upon his impulses, ( to
say nothing of a restraining hand. He
was the possessor of big capabilities
either for good or evil. Would Doris de
velop the god or the devil .in him?
And for Selwyn's part would he make'
the light in his young wife's laughing
eyes still brighter, or would he deepen
the already sensitive curves in her
childish mouth? . '
Two ye_ajrs had proved Chester's
doubts to be not without Justification.
"What a pity, what a pity!" he thought
as ho sat in his office one morning and
looked across the table at his fair
client.
â  "So, you've come to me, . Doris, for
advice?" He looked out of his window.
How mockingly the skyscrapers loomed
against the sky line! A monument of
man's greatness â and yet, at ; heart, so
little was man! He turned searchingly
upon Doris. V
"Do you really want me to speak as
your lawyer?" She bent her pretty head
in affirmation. "Well," answered he,
still nieeting her eyes keenly, "divorce
him."
"Yes," she laughed v (it was the laugh
of a woman who dare not cry),-. "the
facts are hideous enough, are i they; not?";
"Walt, that was your lawyer's advice.
As your cousin; Doris, as his friend, as
a man, God knows, who loves you both.
I beg you to^forglve him. Hasn't he re
pented, dear? Doesn't he ask you to
let him begin all over again on a clean
slate? That's all a man can, do; it's a
woman's hand must wipe out all the
old hideous markings."
She leaned wearily back in her chair.
"Yes," she said, "we women are sent
into the world to pardon, aren't weâ
like Governors and priests? Only we
are not expected to give sentences and
penances."

telegraphing ahead to riverside deal

Negro roustabouts , with cargo hooks
disturbed our privacy at all hours of
the day and night, digging out con
signments of | baled hay- Layer by
layer, the coons peeled our happy home
away. Further and further aft we
burrowed, until, at the end of the sec
onÂ£ day,' we fetched up against the en
gine room bulkhead. There was ,no
way to gnaw through that obstacle, so,
rather than jump overboard, Carl and
I admitted that we were discovered. ;
A red-necked mate who had killed a
dozen stowaways, he said, laughed at
Carl's white socks, after which he
took us before the purser, in the white
and old gold cabin on the upper deck.
In that gorgeous tribunal we heard our
doom pronounced. It was "either pay
fare to New Orleansâ $3 50 each, deck
passage â or get off at the next landing.
I glanced ahead at the next landingâ
a muddy, oozy stretch of Arkansan
shore, clouded into a misty rain and
sloping away into a swamp.
Night was coming on. Here and there
a live oak tree "wearing long, gray
whiskersâ Spanish I believe, is
the tonsorial nameâ stood like a lost
Rip Van Winkle in that moist and for
bidding wilderness. The only living be
ing in sight was a rickety Uncle Tom
seated on a bale of cotton in a two
wheeled cart, waitinff for the steam
boat. His "mule, apparently, had died
standing in shafts. And that was the
place for us to get off, not.
My heart ceased to beat, and I could
hear a funny clicking noise in the com
edian's neck, .like a duck choking to
death.
"Mister," I said to tne purser, "we
haven't any money, but wealthy rela
tives will meet the boat at New Or
leans and pay all charges."
The purser peered out of his little box
office, laughed brutally and" said he
couldn't do it. Too many bums tried
*to work him on that gag.
"Well, I'll put up my baggage for
security," I pleaded.
"Let me see it," said the purser, with
out looking up from his work. ,
When I requested Carl to go below
for the- valise, he seemed about to
throw a fit. He was even more of a
Dutchman than his costume would in
dicate, and the way our affairs were
being dented all but paralyzed him. All
the same, the valise was bought with
my money. Carl held an honorary
membership* in the sausage and onions,
but I had a right to Invest the gas
â¢ meter as I saw flt, and he knew it.
Capital is mighty and will prevail.
During the absence of Carl I gazed
at the negro porter, who stood guard
gazed at him with an intense and over
whelming Rock-of-ages-deft-for-me
expression. If I did get t>y the 'purser
with my little 'game/ It was^up to the
porter to either make or break me, but
If he saw or understood the black man
- made no sign. He kept me guessing:

According to him, there was no truth,

JASMINE
flc came up from the streets below.
"Where did the Jasmine come from,
Doris?" he asked abruptly. The pene-
trating odor had suddenly made him
hark back to the day of that pretty
little Southern wedding In New Or
leans, when everything seemed crowd
ed with its perfume. '^-V;
â  A crimson flush 1 surged into Doris'
cheeks, then spread to her broad,
sweet temples and dimpled chin.
"The jasmine?" she echoed helplessly.
"Yes, where did you get it?"
Still flushing, but silent, she lookeel
down at the white waxen petals and
the shining leaves.
"Will you give me a flower?" said
Chester curiously. She wrenched the
jasmine from her girdle - and impul
sively rose from her chair.
"Certainly," she said, "take all of it.
Take it . as a portion of your fee.
You've told me what I can do; ,to
morrow"}ni drop In and tell you what
I want to do."
\ As â  her hand touched his for a sec
ond, she nodded whimsically" toward
the Jasmine:
"I reckon this is the first time any
one's ever paid you in such a romantic
fashion?" :
When the elevator had taken her
down Chester walked back to the
table and looked at the blossoms lying,
there in all the stiff, white pride of
their Southern fragrance.
"And I'd never guessed it," he com
mented, slowly. "So, there's another
man in the case? And I was putting
all' the trouble 'down to Doris' pride. ,
However, this 'jasmine, explains. Poor
Selwynâ poor chap! She;* can't care
overmuch for the donpr^though," he
reflected logically, "or she wouldn't
have left v me this gift.? \ Just' then the

"You shall/ to-morrow, , Tom,";, she
dow ledge like a theater box office,
opening into the main cabin. When my
limp partner returned I took the valise,
stood in the middle of the cabin and
held up our only/ asset for "the inspec
tion of the purser. It looked pretty
brisk and shiny in the half light, and
my soul was uplifted when the man in
the coop said: *
"All right; give it to the porter."
Carl's eyes bulged, and he would
have wept, only his mouth monopolized
all the moisture in. his head. He
thought only of- the sausage and
onions, without a spark of pity or com
passion for the nervous strain I had
undergone, saving his life and mine up
to that point, with the porter 'yet to
hear from.
"There's a little light lunch in the
grip I would like to take out if you
don't care," I ventured to remind the
purser.
"I don't want your miserable lunch,"
he gruffly replied, at tne "same time
handing over a couple of deck passage
checks he had made out for us.
Having so far succeeded as a strate
gist I .circled about with the valise and
placed it on the deck directly under
the office ledge! The purser couldn't
see me unless' he rose up and hung
himself across the opening, and I saw
no reason why he should do that, be-

"I've made up my mind at last!" She
was gone, but not before he had caught
a gleam of tears in her eyes.
As Chester waited at the "L" station
on his way up town that afternoon
some one grabbed his arm and gave
him a gay greeting. When he glanced
at the fine "boyish face he almost
groaned. "The woman he â¢ loves will
make him a god or a devil, I used to
think," reflected Chester as they made
for a double seat in the car. "And
when Doris is ., gone â not much doubt
about the outcome."
"Walt a minute, old boy," said Sel
wyn, as Tom, in uncertainty, was about
to pull out an evening paper. "You've
been a jolly stanch friend to . me;

at Memphis about laying up a cheap

drizzle was fierce.
Carl and I huddled together that
night in a coil of rope on the dismal
lower deck devoid of sheltering hay.

All of our Senators and Congressmen

When Congress did by any chance pass

they were only covering their tracks.
We all know that kind of a man; per
haps we're something the same kind
of a feline ourselves-
It didn't make any difference to the
knocker what he' was talking about,
he was always ready to point out the
blowholes and the rust specks. ' If he
were looking at Daubem's latest
masterpiece he could find more faults
with the perspective, or the composi
tion, or the coloring, or the technique,
or something else, than the poor
painter ever imagined could be crowd
ed into one small canvas. Tou see,
the knocker had the idea, which a
great many people share with him.
that the proper way to criticize a pic
ture is to bend all your labors to con
vincing the artist that he might be a
fair success as a plain and simple
kalsominer. In literature the knock
er was also right on deck. According
to him, the last great novelist died
with Thackeray, and he didn't think
so much of Thackeray either.' In fact,
he doubted if there had ever been any
great works, of fiction, and he was
very sure that there never would be
again. The only great dramatist was
Shakespeare, and he stole all his ideas
and hired some one else to write his
plays for him. Browning was the
last of the poets, and people thought
that he , was great Just because they
couldn't understand what he was talk
ing about. In music Wagner was
without a peer, and even he didn't
appear to be worth five dollars for an
orchestra seat.
A casual conclusion as to the knock
i er's status in society would have been
, that a man who knew so much about
how things should be done, at least
to the extent of knowing that they
1 were always done wrong, would have
1 been selected as the best man in the
i community . for the most important
,post. That's right where you'd make
the- wildest guess possible. When It
came time to elect a representative In

equally sure that she could whip any

\ He hadn't even heard that the coun-
k try was going to the demnition bow

'if he had, and he was willing to bet

I prettiest and, wittiest, . American men
\ the bravest, American horses . the fast

and America herself the finest example
and the great and lasting good the
Great Emancipator had done for pos
terity cm the pork. Next day I hunted
up the negro porter and told him, with
vast pride of voice and gesture, that I
hailed from the same State â Mudville,

a true answer, and If they did, wouianf
you be very apt to feel hurt and abused
or think It Just a bit of spite work?
Instead of asking your friends ask your
mirror. Rest assured it will tell you
the plain, unvarnished truth and not bÂ«
the least backward about it, either.
Perhaps this will sound too much HkÂ«
practicing and fostering vanity, but II
you will look long and earnestly at
yourself in the shining surface and seÂ«
yourself exactly as others see you, X
doubt very much if there will bo very
much vanity to trouble about.
Ten to one you will discover furrows
and wrinkles that will be more than a
painful surprise to you. Here and thera
a telltale line will assert Itself and a
peculiar drawn expression about the
mouth will tell you plainer than any
words that you are failing most woe
fully in some direction.
Stop and examine yourself critically.
Do not try to gloss over your faults and
explain them away, but for once in your
life be quite as hard upon yourself as
any one else could possibly be. Then
and only then will you be able to know
to what extent the spirit is acting upon
the face, and whether it Is for good
or bad.
No amount of cosmetics, pretty frocks
and becoming hats will write a pleas
ant etory upon' your face if the story
is not in your heart. Fretting brings
ugly lines, fault-finding disagreeable
curves, and anxiety a subtle something
that takes away all the peace and
sweetness from the face, no matter how
youthful it may be.
Tire busy woman who exercises her
bra'.n Is bright looking and every mus
cle, in her face spells intellectualitj'.
Why? Simply because her time is de
voted to some particular line of busi
ness that develops and broadens her,
and she is too intent and too Interested
in her pet hobby to Indulge in petty
gossip and bickering of any kind.
The plainest face takes on an interest
If there is any development behind it,
but if your face lacks intellectuality
there is but one way to remedy it. Get
your brain into swift action and think
more of others than of yourself. In
other words train your mind as you
have trained your body, and it cannot
help but influence the expression of
your face. Now do not imagine that
it is absolutely necessary to go in for
a course of higher education, though,
to be sure, the more you know the more
your being will reflect. Go In for any
thing and everything. Learn to sew, to
cook, to sing, to handle horses, to play
games well, to read books wisely, in
fact, anything that will make you more
interesting and that will take you out
of yourself, for the minute you forget
yourself, your trials and tribulations,
you are getting out of an unhappy,
commonplace rut that doÂ«s neither you
or any one else any good.
Perhaps more than half the wrinkles
eeen In the face are caused by laughing,
pain or tricks of some kind that one is
perfectly unconscious of. For instance,
how perfectly natural it is to sit down,
put the chin In the hand and press the
flesh out of position. Of course doing
this now and then would have little or
no effect, but the girl who continually
Eits in this position soon discovers to
her sorrow that her face is growing
rather one-sided and that wrinkles are
forming that age her 'ten or twelve
years.
The jolly girl Is always In a peck of
trouble nnd the more, she laughs the
deeper the lines about her mouth and
eyes grow, but thanks be, they at least
do not betoken a cross, irritable dispo
sition, for nothing lights up one quite
so much as gladness, and no amount of
wrinkles can ever cover, up or efface
the marks that happlness'Ieaves on the
brow of her best beloved.
But wrinkles, whatever their cause,
are not pretty, and the sooner they are
eradicated the better. Steaming the
face and then applying . some good
cream will take out the fine lines, but
it will not touch the heavy ones that
run across the forehead or that insist
upon making themselves distinctly dis
agreeable about the eyes. For them
there Is but one simple remedy. The
use-of adhesive plaster. Just about the
time you are ready to retire place a
piece of rubber plaster over the wrin
kles and let it remain there during the
night. Be especially careful when put
ting It on the forehead, for if the hair
or eyebrows come in contact with It
they will have to come out by the roots,
and it Is rather a painful operation.
And, by the way, when you put the
plaster on, draw It rather snugly over
the lines and do not try to remove it
without the use of alcohol. Hot .water
only makes it 6tlcky. uncomfortable and
difficult to manage, but alcohol cuts
and loosens gradually and the bandage
may be removed gently and without
pain. SSJB
In rubbing the face try to remember
to rub ud Instead of down. Naturally
the skin Rags and droops and years of
rubbing helps the good cause along In
an astounding fashion. If you're rub
bins a cold cream about . your mouth
make the upward stroke > the. heaviest
ana the downward ones as rew and aa
light as possible.
Cosmetics never accomplish any real
good. Powders clog the pores or thÂ«
skin and toilet vinegars possess drying
qualities that are bad unless t':e skin
is very oily and soft.
Instead of the thousand and ona
preparations that are on the marked
try pure soap and water, both hot and
cold 1 , and see what it will do for you.
The flabby muscles and flesh will fresh
en up and regain some of their natural
firmness, and if you massage system
atically your good looks will slowly but
surely come back to you and you will
have discovered the fountain of youth.

ACK LONDON'S last novel, "The
J Sea -Wolf," must give pause even
to the most ardent of the vounc
CaJiforaian writer's admirers.
For by the very insistence of a
certain element in the ttllinc of
hsf= la?t story London boldly challenges
a question which his former tales have
raised, thoufih in less decree, and which
â will find in its answer, Riven bv the
readers, the forecast of future success
or failure for London the writer of fic
tion. This question, boldly put. is: In
how large a measure does the element
of strength in a novel condone the use
of the ugly, the sordid, the brutal; can
ihe utter elimination of the spiritual in
favor of press materialism be consid
ered an axsct of esthetic value in the
final appiairc-iKent of a novel's worth?
This itjsue is boldly, even pujrnacious
|y forced by Mr. London in this storv
of his. I can recall no piece of English
or American fiction of receftt vears
which insists upen a display of the raw
meat of life such as does "The Sea-
Wolf." The tritj phrase of the review
ers who sum up the worth of a book
by its arterial pressure of "Rood red
blood" certainly applies to London's sea
story as it has applied to no recent
piece of fiction. Red blood spurts from
every page of Wolf Larsen's lo:r. red
blood and teeth coughed up after blows,
and ribs cracked from tigerish mauline.
The central figure, at all times the con
trolling lijrure, is a Cyclops, a. moral
Caliban, whose law is the law of the
Stone Age and whose scheme of life is
that of the "Mad Philosopher." Nietz-
Eche^-life the sordid thing. From the
second chapter of the book throuerh to
the last the atmosphere is permeated
with the taint of this Wolf Larsenâ a
man whom London calls "Lucifer,
proud spirit" â destroyer, infidel, captain
of a "hell ship" in very truth. There
is no surcease from the spoken and
acted enormities of the man. Blood and
blasphemy reek from three hundred
pages of "The Sea-Wolf."
To what end? True, brutalitv has
found place in the most treasured of
our classics. Homer sings of Achilles
dragging Hector about the walls of
â¢Troy at the tail of his chariot: but
this exemplifies the divine rage of men
of the heroic age. Tolstoy tells of the
horrors of war in his "Sevastopol" with
the single purpose of painting the un
pardonable tragedy of conflict. The
brutality in "The Sea-Wolf" serves no
purpose but its own; it is brutality
for brutality's sake. Granted that the
ultimate aim of the story is to dem
onstrate the development that comes to
the character of the dilettante Hum
phrey Van Weyden, can it be esti
mated in the final instance that Van
Weyden is the better man for witness-
Ing and suffering: for months the in
human barbarisms of Wolf Larsen,
even though to his talents as a literary
critic he has added that of naviga
tion?
Wolf Larsen's savagery constructs
nothing, profits nothing. His gross
iconoclasm of philosophy moves no
body in the story, convinces nobody.
This savagery, then, this iconoclasm.
serves but to bring strength to the au
thor's conception of his characterâ and
â¢ue are back to the question: Does the
suppression of the spiritual to the ad
vancing of bald, hard materialism make
for strength^ In a novelâ for true
strength?
Consideration of this element of the
novel aside, It may be heartily assert
ed that London has given here a vivid
picture of the seaâ vivid to a degree
that most landsmen cannot appreciate.
The author has exhibited here, as in
his other stories, a remarkable facility
for producing an atmosphere for his
plot which pricks itself line for line
on the retina of the reader's Imagina
tion. The tossing schooner Ghost, its
rnongrel crew of flotsam. Wolf Larsen
himself, are realâ real as if the reader
â were In Humphrey Van Wede*n's sea
toots. The Incident of the attack upon
Death JJarsen's sealing crew and the
subsequent flight through the fog, as
"well as the description of Larsen's
masterful seamanship in the typhoon
are Intensely vivid. London has the
knack of coloring essential detail in a
manner such as to embrace and out
line the whole picture. i
The author's grasp upon the course
of true love^is not so certain. The
â whole incident of Van Weyden's res
cue" of Maud Brewster from the Ghost,
of their subsequent drifting in an
open boat, their sojourn on a desert,,
Island and their final emancipation
from the wilderness of the sea Iack3
the 'convincing quality that charac
terizes the early part of the tale. It
reads like an excerpt from the story
books. The psychological moment for
the Implanting of that kiss upon the
fair Maud's lips was not at the light
ing of final deliverance, but at the
â¢Instant the castaways set foot on En
deavor Island.
If, in resume. I may be permitted
an expression of opinion directly per
ronal I say that "The Sea-Wolf" will
add nothing to Mr. London's credit
and that another story of its frankly
brutal nature would detract largely
-from his well-earned reputation. I
do not believe that the reading world
wants this butcher's meat, hacked
dripping from the bones of realism.

painting the heavy shadows of
wretched humanity. Tragedy and

power transcending that manifested in
any of his former works. "The Prod
igal Son" is a terrible story, a strong
story, if not a pleasant one.
In several of his Â©Arlier novels, not
ably "The Manxman" and "The Bonds
man," Caine wrought tragedy out of
circumstance ar.d incident â the accu
mulations of fate terribly piled up; the
free play of the characters themselves
availed little in the final denouement.
This last story of his is immeasurably
stronger, more artistic thUn the others
becaure in it the psychology of events
is reflected directly upon the psycho
logical inspirations of his characters.
He has made a closer study of the
cause and effect of human emotions
and impulses; circumstance has to play
no god from the machine; the human
soul works out its own destiny. The
story teems not fiction, but life re
vealed, line for line. s
Iceland makes the theater for "The

ARTIST
Tries at Fiction.
fÂ± NDRE CASTAIGNE, one 'of the
LJ best known illustrators of the.
J 1 modern school, has essayed to es
* tablish himself in a new depart
ment of the arts with his first
novel, "Fata Morgana." His initial at
tempt, however, is hardly flattering
enough to encourage any further exer
tion in this line of endeavor; he would
better stick to his last and continue In
the province where his abilities have
gained such permanent recognition.
"Fata Morgana" is far from beintr a
good novel.
Good in spots but weak in construc
tion and almost absolutely lacking in
coherence is this story of Castaij?ne's.
He begins his tale in the middle and
then after several chapters goes back
to pick up the threads that are wav
ing wildly about, demanding a place
in the woof of the plot. Then when
the premises of the' action have been
laid affairs carry along to the original
point of break and after one hundred
pages the reader begins to find himself
and to identify the present with what
goes before. Another break, and the
story carries to a castle on the Adriatic
â a fiction castle, of course â where a
strange melodrama of prophecy and
present evil is enacted. At the end
the reader gathers what he may. from
the tangle and counts nearly 600 pages
that have taxed his eyes fruitlessly.
Bohemian Parisâ the Bohemia of the
Quartier Latin, the ateliers and the Bal
de Quat'z-Artsâ as. reflected tin' Cas
taigne's novel gives it Its cmef worth.
Of course one like the author, who has
lived his life In the. student atmos
phere of Paris and who even now is
the head of an art school there, has
the atmosphere of the place at first
hand, and Castalgne reproduces" It with
convincing. surety. In the first chap
ters of his novel, wherein he deals .with
the early struggles of his. hero to gain
a foothold In the art world, the author
has given many clear-cut pictures of
the rare bonhomie and generous good
fellowship obtaining in the art quar
ter. His characters Poufaille and Su
zanne, the journeyman sculptor and his
model, are the best in the book judged
from the interest which centers about
them. Helia, the heroine, is very like
one of the artist-author's lay models;
she "stays put" wherever her creator
wills it and her actions are as mechan
ical as a lay figure's. Philip, the young
artist, has the originality of indecision.
if this sole distinctive feature of his
mental endowments can be called orig
inal.
If illustrations made the book "Fata
Morgana" would be one of the most
prized volumes of the M e&son. Over
sixty of his pencil creations has Cas
taigne contributed to the textâ all trood.
Had the author added to this number
by about one-half again he' might have
omitted the story altogether and still
given the reader as tangible a grasp of
the plot as the printed page does. .

FICTION
and Fact Reviewed.
POSSESSING much of the fascina
tion of H. G. Wells' stories of the
Improbable and written In a style
vigorous and tensely dramatic,
James Barnes' novel, "The Unpar
donable War," is a book to spur, the
Interest of the most blase reader
of fiction. Not that Its fundament
al plot scheme is startling in.. Its
originality â stories of hypothetical
wars between world powers have
been written in goodly numbers;
but the vividness of the book's Inci
dents of battle both on sea aod land is
commensurable with that of a pano
rama, so clear-cut, does each feature
stand put in near perspective. The au
thor's description of the great sea fight
between the -British and American
fit ets reads . as if it were written by
Captain Mahan.
According to Barnes' story the
echoes of the Russo-Japanese war had
not been long dead when. an unfortu
nate combination of ; circumstances
brought England and our.country to
terrible blows.' , The, sudden sweeping
Into the Presidential office of a.candi
date of the People's party and the at
tendant propaganda of quasl-Sociallsm
had served to spread confusion to busi
ness at home and to make dangerous
our relations abroad.* An unscrupul
ous^owner of 'a syndicate, of news
papers cognlves with certain disreput
able members of the'weVk President's
Cabinet to bring, on a war In order
that the mistakes -of the party in
power may not; grow; too large in the
public opinion. ' By fclever distortion of
truth \ and â¢ insistent bully-ragging, the
newspaper syndlcate\: actually -does
bring matters' to such a j>ass that the
unintentional ramming of a British
battleship by, an American boat pre
cipitates hostilities. One great land
tattle Is fought near Montreal and one
[engagement between the belligerent
fleets occurs off the Atlantic coast,
then by a wonderful invention of an
American scientist, the nature of
which will not be unfairly disclosed
here, war is suddenly brought to a
standstill on account of the very fu
tility of the weapons of destruction.
Aside from the vivid descriptions of
conflict in the book not a little interest
attaches to the author's clever antici
pations of the strides of science. . Both
upon the ships of war and with the
armies, on land there are utilized in
struments of offense" and defense
which seem not impossible, though
they are for the time being but the
figments of the author's imaginings.

"Hearts In Exile," John Oxenham's
story of Siberia and the secret arm of
the great white Czar, Is not sensa
tional as it might easily have been, but
a strong, well balanced tale of dra
matic interest. The author exhibits all
the earmarks of the true story-teller in
his sympathetic handling of situations
which would call for strained heroics or
the crudest kind f of bathos, from one
less skilled in the art than Oxenham.
Beginning with a marriage between a
wealthy Russian and a girl who has
aspirations for the uplifting of the
masses, this story of Russia rapidly
develops the dangers attending any
work of reform in the Czar's country.
Serge Palma, the successful of the two
rivals who had bidden for the hand
of the philanthropic maid, finds that
his interest In his wife's schemes leads
to the grim road to* Siberia. But on
his way to exile Palma meets Paul
Pavlof, the disappointed but high
minded lover, and consents to the lat
ter's offer to change places in order
that the girl behind mayunot be be
reaved. How the wife, not knowing
of the change, goes to Siberia In search
of her husband and finds there her
former lover instead, and /how, as her
guardian, Paul lâ¬ads the woman out
of dangerous places to final happiness â
these things make a strong and thrill
ing tale. Â»

which prima facie Is nothing more tnan
the wildest romance, this writer brings
to his task such directness and force
of conviction that the reader begins to

probable, but reasonably within the
bounds of possibility- To. say that the

THE MONTH
in Magazine World.
THE Christmas number of Scrib
ner's Magazine is unusually beau
tiful in its pictures, both in color
and black and white, and Is filled
with sketches and short stories that are
not only amusing and entertaining, but
are good literature and full of charac
ter, as well as adapted to the Christ
mas season. Specially noteworthy art
features are the colored frontispiece,
by Maxfleld Parrish; the illustrations
In color for some "Scenes From the Old
Ballads," by Beatrice Stevens; the
drawings by Walter Appleton Clark,
showing Christmas scenes In an old
French village; a drawing of a mother
and child In colors by Sarah Stilwell,
accompanying a poem by E. S. Martin,
and the beautiful colored cover by Da
vid Erlcson.
, Short fiction Is abundant and of great
variety â
"McAllister's Christmas" Is the story
of how a comfortable clubman got Into
the Tombs and saw how Christmas was
spent In the underworld. The author,
Arthur Train, Is an Assistant District
Attorney, j Edith Wharton has a story
of artistic life in New York, "The Pot
Boiler." Octave Thanet's story "The
Angel of His Youth" is a tale of dis
illusionment. The late Guy Wetmore
Carryl is represented by a most amus
ing story entitled "William, Alfy and
Henry John." Another humorous story,
"The Corner Cupboard Man," is by
Sydney Preston, the author of "The
Green Pigs."
The position of distinction held by
McClure's in story as well as article
is* well sustained .by the fiction of the
December number. James Hopper
leads with "A Jumble in Divinities,"
which for charm of style and quality
of sentiment can hardly be excelled
as a Christmas story. There are more
stories that^ppeal to our primal sense
of what is beautiful and tender to our
better instincts and tastes, with a
moving force. George Madden Mar
tin's "God Rest You, Merry Chris
tians." Marion Hill's "His Journey to
the Gates," Janet Remington's "The
Way Wonderful," Herman Knicker
bocker VIele's "The Money Meter,"
are about the people and things we all
know, real' and homely and familiar,
feeling what we have felt and draw-
Ing our warmest sympathy. Mrs.
Martin's is a Christmas story., which
reflects the season and its meaning.
Then there are more of the masterly
studies of men and things in the
rough, of that great Americk which
lies far west of Hoboken, as artis
tically perfect expressions of the un
familiar as are these other stories of
the ordinary. Rex. E. Beach de
scribes a terrible contest of two miners
with cold and hunger and distance. in
the Arctic circle, "The Test." in which
mind defeats matter. Stewart Ed-
Avard White continues his serial, "The
Rawhide," and carries us /with un
broken Interest Into the mysteries of
"the round-up" "the trail" in the
Arizona desert. O. Henry has a de
llghtfullyv humorous sketch of the
matrimonial adventures of two retired
miners In "The Ransom of Mack." A
collection of thrilling stories, con
densed under one title, Is found in
"Notes from a Trainer's Book," by
Samuel Hopkins Adams.
The spirit of Christmas invades the
editorial sanctum long before December
comes, and the Christmas magazines
celebrate the holiday season with a
specially liberal literary and artistic
menu.' Among the Christmas maga
zines The Booklovers will take a
foremost place. It ! contains a varied
and attractive array of literary con
tributions, and an unusually quantity
of brilliant and artistic illustrations,
many of them in color and tint.
Pastor' Charles Wagner, the apostle
of the simple life, opens the December
number with a. brief "Christmas Mes
sage," written in French 'and trans
lated by Mary Bacon. It is a singularly
fresh and unconventional treatment of
an almost threadbare subject, a paean
of praise on the beauty of the "mother
spirit" that at Christmastlde, at least,
is universal and powerfuIMn Its appeal
to the best in human nature.
One of the most interesting papers In
the December number is that by Bur
riss Gahan on "The Real Australian,"
being the first of a series of three pa-
pers on the Island continent. In this
article Mr. Gahan introduces the reader
to "the land and the people" in that
country of opposites, and describes and
corrects those first impressions of the
traveler which are so apt to be false
and misleading.
Pearson's magazine for December
presents the unusually numerous col
lection of six special articles and eight
sparkling pieces of fiction.
"The American House of Lords," by
David S. Barry, is the leading article. 1
and tells of the perquisites and sine
cures of United States Senators; as
they are to convene on the first Mon
day of December, this paper Is pecul
iarly timely. A sketch of the philan
thropic career of the late Louis Flelsch
mann relates the history and the da-
tails of his world-famous Bread Una.
one of the nlsht sights of New York.
Still another timely article Is H. P.
Burchell's "International Athletics,**
copiously illustrated with photographs.
In his story Mr. Burchell briefly re
counts the results of this year's Ameri
can sporting achievements in compe
tition with England,, Canada, Ger
many and France. The article
embraces everything from the de
feat of Emperor William's Meteor to
the victories of Americans over English
track* teams and cricket teams, and
German bowling teams.
The number of clippings from Sun
set which one sees in Eastern publi
cations Is the best evidence of the pro
gress which this local magazine Is
making. Its December number contains
some material which would easily be
featured in the select pages of a few
of its aristocratic New York contem
poraries. For fiction readers Mrs.
Mabel Craft Deering contributes "The
Stocking Speaks," wherein that glori
fied adjunct of the winter festival tells
a strange pathetic tale of its peregrina
tions. "Christmas Marketing on thÂ«
Yukon" by Samuel Hubbard reveals
some of the joys of preparing for the
Yuletide feast under the aurora with
eggs at 52 a dozen. Ella M. Sexton
is the author of a tale of the Latin
quarter, "The Romance of Concha."
Besides two very good pieces of verse
by E. A. Brinins^pol and Jeanett*
Campbell. Christmas Sunset contains
some good solid matter â "Far West
ern History" by Professor H. Morsa
Stevens of the University of California.
"Outdoor Life In California" by Wil
liam Greer Harrison, president of the
Olympic Club; "On the King's High
way" by Wallace Everett, and much
else that is good reading.
The Thanksgiving number of ThÂ»
Youth's Companion (November 24) is
so satisfying as to make turkey seem
almost superfluous. It contains six
complete short stories, two of â¢which,
are Thanksgiving stories, one by Bliss
Perry, editor of the Atlantic Monthly,
the other by Harriet Prescott Spofford.
There Is a capital illustrated article.
"Our Boys in Gray" â scenes In tha
life of a letter carrier, written by one
of them. There is another illustrated
article telling how to build a "Scooter"
or combined ice and water boat.
There are nearly a dozen short char
acter sketches, mostly humorous,
anecdotes of Nathaniel Hawthorne,
George Frederick Watts and the Chi
nese Emperor and Dowager Empress,
nearly a score of Interesting selections
of miscellany, besides the stories and
poems and the children's page, a phy
sician's contribution on "Schools and
Nerves" and the notes on Nature and
Science and Current Events.

J FIRST met him one Fourth of July
afternoon !a the middle eighties. The
-t^ius: streets and high board side
walks cf the lumber town were filled
to the brim with people. The perma
nent population of the town, dressed In
the stlffest of its Sunday best, escorted
gingham wives or sweethearts; a dozen
outsiders like myself tried not to be too
conspicuous In a city smartness; but
the great multitude was composed of
the men of the woods.
I sat, chair tilted, by the hotel.
â matching them pass. Their heavy
â woolen shirts crossed by the broad
suspenders, the red of their sashes or
leather shine of their belts, their short
kersey trousers "slagged" off to leave
a pap between the knee and the
heavily spiked "cork boots"â all these
â were distinctive enough of their class,
but most interesting to me were the
eyes that peered from beneath their lit
tle round hats tilted rakishly askew. In
my half-conscious scrutiny I probably
ftared harder than I knew, for all at
once a pair of blue laughing eyes
suddenly met mine full, and an ironi
cal voice drawled:
"Say. bub, you look as Interested as
a man killing snakes. Am I your long
lost friend?"
"I guess you are." I replied, "if you
can tell me what all this outfit's head
ed for."
He thrust back his hat and ran his
hand through a mop of closely cropped
light curls.
"Birllng match," he explained briefly.
"Come on!"
I joined him, and together we fol
lowed the crowd to the river, where
â we roosted like cormorants on adjacent
piles overlooking a patch of clear water
among the filled booms.
"Drive's just over," my new friend
Informed me. "Rear come down last
night Fcurther July celebration. This
little town win scratch fer th* tall Um
ber along about midnight when the
boys go In to take her apart."*
A half-dozea men with peavles rolled
a -white pine log of about a foot and a
half diameter Into the clear water,
where it lay rocking back and forth
three cr four feet from the boom piles.
Suddenly a man ran the length of the
boom, leaped easily Into the air and
landed with both feet square on one
fad of the floating log. That end dis
appeared In an ankle deep swirl of
â white fcani, the other rose suddenly,
and the whole timber projected forward
by the chock, drove headlong to the
middle of the pond. And the man, his
arms folded, his knees Just bent In the
graceful, nervous attitude of the circus
rider, stood upright like a statue of
bronze.
A roar approved this feat.
"That's Dicky Darren,** said my In
formant, "Roaring Dick. Watch him.**
The man on the log was small, with
clean, beautiful haunches and shoul
ders, but with hanging baboon arms.
Perhaps his most striking feature was
a mop of reddish-brown hair that over
shadowed a little triangular white face,
accented by two reddish-brown quadri
laterals that served as eyebrows, and
a pair of Inscrutable chipmunk eyes.
Fcr a moment he poised erect In the
great calm <Z the public performer.
Then slowly he began to revolve the
log under his feet. The lofty gaze, the
folded arms, the straight supple waist
budged not by a hair's breadth; only
the feet stepped forward, at first de
liberately, then faster and faster, unUl
the rolling log threw a blur of spray a
foot into the air. Then suddenly slap!
ciap! the heavy calks stamped a re
versal. The log came Instantaneously
to rest, quivering exactly like some an
imal that had been spurred through Its
paces.
"Magnificent!" I cried. *
"That's nothing!" my companion
repressed me, "anybody can birl a log.
Watch this."
Roaring Dick for the first time un
folded his arms. With some appear
ence of caution he balanced his un
stable footing Into absolute immobil
ity. Then he turned a somersault.
This was the real thing. My friend
cttered a wild veil of aunlause which
THE RIVERMAN
iras lest in a j^raeral roar.
A long pike pole shot out. bit the
end of the timber and towed it to the
boom pile. Another man stepped on
the log with Darrell. They stood fac
ing each other, bent-kneed, ulerL Sud
denly with one accord they com
menced to birl the loir from left to
right. The pace grew hot. Like squir
rels treading a cage their feet twin
kled. Then it became apparent that
Darrell's opponent was gradually be
ing forced from the top of the log.
He could not keep up. Little by little,
still moving desperately, he dropped
back to the slant, then at last to the
edge and so oil into the river with a
mighty splash. â¢ . .
"Clean birled!" commented my
friend. One after another a half dor
en rlvermen tackled the imperturb
able Dick, but none of them pos
sessed the agility of my on top' in the
pace he set them. One boy of 18
eeemed for a moment to hold his own
and managed at least to keep out of
the water even when Darrell' had ap
parently reached his maximum speed.
But that expert merely threw his en
tire weight into two reversing stamps
of his feet and the young fellow dove
forward as abruptly as though he had
been shied over a horse's head.
The crowd was by now getting up
roarious and impatient of volunteer
effort to humble Darren's challenge.
It wanted the best and at once. It be
gan, with Increasing insistence, to
shout a name.
"Jimmy Powers!" it vociferated.
"Jimmy Powers."
And then by shamefaced bashful
ness, by profane protest, by muttered
and comprehensive curses I knew that
my companion on the other pile was
indicated.
A dozen men near at hand began to
shout. "HÂ«re he is!" they cried, "Come
on, Jimmy," "Don't be a highbanker."
"Hang his hide on the fence."
Jimmy, still red and swearing, suf
fered himself to be pulled from his ele
vation and disappeared in the throng.
A moment later I caught his head and
shoulders pushing toward the boom
piles, and so in a moment he stepped
warily aboard to face his antagonist
This was evidently no question to be
determined by the simplicity of force
or the simplicity of a child's trick.
The two men stood half-crouched, face
to face, watching each other narrowly,
but making no move. To me they
seemed like two wrestlers sparring for
an opening. Slowly the log revolved
way, then slowly the other. It was a
mere courtesy of salute. All at once
Dick birled three rapid strokes from
left to right, as though about to roll
the log, leaped into the air and landed
square with both feet on the other
slant of the timber. Jimmy Powers
felt the Jar and acknowledged it by the
spasmodic jÂ£rk with which he coun
terbalanced Darrell's weight. But he
was not thrown.
As though this daring and hazardous
maneuver had opened the combat, both
men sprang to life. Sometimes the log
rolled one way, sometimes the other,
sometimes it Jerked from side to side
with the rapidity of light, always in
a smother of spray and foam. The de
cided spat, spat, spat of the reversing
blows from the calked boots sounded
like picket 2ring.
The crowd wA appreciative and par
tisan â for Jimmy Powers. It howled
wildly, and rose thereby to even higher
excitement. Then it forgot its man
ners utterly and groaned when it made
out that a sudden splash represented
its favorite, while the indomitable Dar
rell still trod the quarterdeck as cham
pion birler of the year. .
I must confess that I was as sorry
as anybody. I climbed down from my
cormorant roost, and picked my way
between the alleys of aromatic piled
lumber in order to avoid the press, and
cursed the little gods heartily for un

"I'm sorry," said I behind him. "How

He whirled, and I could see that his

eyes were shot with blood. * '.
"Oh, It's you. is It?" he growled, dis
paragingly. "Well, that's how he did

He held out his foot. Across the in

"Why didn't you make a kick?" I
cried.
"That ain't how I do it," he mut

"But no," I Insisted my indignation
mounting. "It's an outrage! That
crowd, was with you. 'All you had to
do was to say something "
He cut me short. "And give myself
away as a blanked foolâ sure Mike. I
ought to know Dickey Darrell by this
time, and I ought to be big enough to
take care of myself." He stamped his
foot Into his driver's shoe and took me
by the arm, his humor apparently re
stored. "No, don't you lose any hair,
bub; I'll get even with Roaring, Dick."
That night, having, by the advice of
the proprietor, moved my bureau and
trunk against the bedroom door May
wide awake listening to the taking of
the town apart... At each
vicious crash I wondered if that might
be Jimmy Powers getting even with
Roaring Dick.
The following 1 year, but a -little
earlier in the season. â  I again visited
my lumber town. In striking contrast
to the life of that* other midsummer
day were the deserted streets. The
landlord knew me. and after ' I haa
washed and eaten approached me with
a suggestion.
"You got all day in front of you."
said he. "Why don't you take a honse
and buggy and make a visit to the
big Jam? Everybody's up there, more
or less."
In response to my inquiry he re
plied:
"They're jammed at the upper bend
â Jammed bad. The crew's been pick
ing at her for over a week now, and
last night Darrell was down to ses
about some more dynamite. It's worth
seein'. The breast of her is near
thirty foot high, and lots of water in
the river."
"Darrell?" said I, catching the
name.
"Yea. He's rear boss this year. Do
you think vou'd like to take a look
at her?"
I think I should," I assented
The breast, as my landlord had told
me, ror2 sheer from the water to the
height of at Igast twenty-five feet,
bristling and formidable. Back of it
pressed the volume of logs packed
closely in an apparently inextricable
tangle as far as the eye could reach.
A man who was near informed me
that the tail was a good three miles
up stream.
My eye ranged over the men and
finally rested on Dicky Darrell. He
was standing on the slanting end of
an upheaved log, dominating the
scene. His little, triangular face, with
the accents of the Quadrilateral eye
brows, was Dale with the blaze of his
energy, and his chipmunk eyes seemed
to flame with a dynamite vehemence
that caused those on whom their
glance fell to jump as though they
had been touched with a hot poker.
I had heard more of Dicky Darrell,
since my last visit and was glad of the*
chance to observe MorriEon & Daly's
best "driver" at work.
The Jam seemed on the edsre of
breaking. After half an hour's
strained expectation it seemed still on
the very edge of breaking. So- 1 sat
down on a stump. Then for the first
time I noticed another acquaintance
handling his peavie near the very per
son of the rear boss.
"Hullo!" eaid I to myself, "that's
funnv. I wonder if Jimmy Powers got
even; and, if eo, why he is working so
amicably and so near Roaring Dick."
At noon the men came ashore for
dinner. I paid a quarter into the
cook's private exchequer, and so was
fed. After the meal I approached my
acquaintance of the year before-.
"Hullo, Powers!" I greeted him. "I
suppose you don't remember me?"
"Sure," he responded heartily. "Ain't
you a little early this year?**
"No," I disclaimed, "this Is a better
sight than a blrllng match."
I offered him a cigar, which be im
mediately substituted for his corncob
pipe. We sat at the root of a tree.
"It'll be a grea^Eight when that Jam
pulls," said L
"You bet" he replied; "but she's a
teaser. Even old Tim Shearer would
have a picnic to make out Just where
the key logs are. We've started her
three times, but she's plugged .tight
every trip. Likely to pull almost any
time."
We discussed various topics. , Finally
I ventured:
"I see your old friend Darrell Is rear
boss." '
"Yes," said Jimmy -Powers dryly. -,
"By the way, did you fellows . ever
square up on that blrllng. match?"- '
"No," said Jimmy Powers. Then,
after an instant: "Not yet" ;:
I glanced at him to recognize the
square set to the," Jaw that had Im
pressed me so formidably the year be

most quizzically as he' caught sight of
mine.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
face darkened with a swift anger, and
I glimpsed the flare of an undying hate.
About 8 o'clock that afternoon Jim
my's prediction was fulfilled. Without
the slightest warning the Jam "pulled."
Usually certain premonitory cracks,
certain sinkings down, groanings for
ward, grumblings, shruggings and sul
len reluctant shlftings of the logs give
opportunity for the men,to assure their
safety.
The Jam itself started with every In
dication of meaning business, gained
momentum for a hundred feet, â  and
then plugged to a ' standstill. The
"break" was abortive.
: â  Now we all had leisure to notice two
.things. First, the movement had ;. not
been of the whofe-Jam,but bnly-of a
block or section; of it twenty rods < or
so In extent. Thus between; the part
that- had , moved and , the greateri bulk
that had not stirred lay a hundred feet
of open, water j in which* floated a num
ber of loose logs." .','.-.â¢
The second fact was that Dicky ; Dar
rell had fallen Into that open Btretch of
water and "was in the act of swimming
toward one of the floating . logs. \ That
much we were given Just time to ap
preciate thoroughly. Then, the other,
section of the ' Jam rumbled and began
to. break. . Roaring. Dick .was caught
between two gigantic millstones, mov
ing , to crush â  him out of slbht
An .active figure darted down the
tall of the first section, out over .the
floating logs, seized Darrell by the
coat collar, and so burdened began'des
perately to scale the very face of the
breaking Jam.
Never was a more magnificent , res
cue. The logs were rolling, failing,
diving against the laden man. He
climbed as over a treadmill, a- treadmill
whose speed was constantly increasing.
And when he finally gained the top it
was as the gap. dosed, splintering be
neath him and the man he had saved.
It is not in the woodsman to be
demonstrative at . any jLlme, but : here
was work demanding attention.. With
out a pause for breath or congratula
tion they turned to , the necessity ."of
the moment. The Jam,' trie whole Jami

ran ashore for the peavie^ - Roaring
Dick, like a -demon Incarnate, threw
himself into the work. Forty men -at

Roaring like wild cattle the* logs

Men were â  everywhere, â  taking chances
like cowboys before - the stampeded
herd. And so, out of sight around the
lower; bend, swept the front of the
Jam in a whirl of glory, the rlvermen
riding the great brown back of the
creature they subdued, until at last,
with the slackening current the logs
floated by free, caroming with hollow
sound, one against the other. A half
dozen watchers, leaning statuesquely
on the shafts of their peavles. watchea

One by one the spectators departed.
At last only myself and a brown faced
young man remained. He sat on a
stump, staring with sightless eyes Into
vacancy. I did not venture to dis
turb his thoughts.

evening sucked "up the river. Over

The brown faced young man arose
and went to meet them- I saw him
return In. dose conversation with Jim
my. Powers. Before they reached us
he had turned away with a ffesture of
farewell. : . . â¢ . .
Jimmy > Powers stood looking after
him long ' after his form had disap
peared 'and * Indeed, even after the
sound^ of his wheels had died toward
town. As I approached the riverman
turned to me a face â¢ from which the
reckless - contained self-reliance of the
wood worker had faded. It was wl<SÂ«
eyed, with an almost awa stricken
wonder and adoration.
To you know who that Is?" he asked
me In a hushed voice, "That's Thorpe
â Harry Thorpe. And do you know
what he said to me Just now, me? He
told me he wanted me to work m Camp
One next winterâ Thorpe's One. And
he told me I was th# first man he ever
aired straight Into One."
His breath caught with something
like a sob. >
I had heard of the man and of hi*
methods. I knew he had made It a
practice of for his prize
camp only from the employes of his
other camps; that, 'as Jimmy said, he
never "hired straight Into One." 1 bad
heard," too, of his reputation among his
oWn and other woodsmen. But this
was the first time I had ever come Into
personal contact with his Influence. It
impressed me the more In that I had
come to know Jimmy Powers and his
kind.
"You deserve it, every bit," said I.
"I'm not going to call you a hero, be
cause that would make you tired.
What you did thij afternoon showed
nerve. It was a brave act. But it was
a better act because you rescued your
enemy, because you forgot everything
but your common humanity when dan
gerâ"
I broke off. Jimmy was again look
ing at me with his ironically quizzical
grin.
' **Cub," said he, "if you're going to
hang any stars of Bethlehem on my

FORTUNE REJECTED
By German Servant Girl Who Prefers Humble Position
Near to Her Sweetheart to That of a Lady of Riches
CASE HA5 MUCH IN COM/ION WITH "MARY ANN" OF 3 ZANQWILL
BERLIN, Dec 8. â Old Truth goes
right on being stranger than fiction,
no matter whose the fiction may be.
Germany furnishes the newest In
stance, an incident having happened In
this country that Is Just Israel Zang
will's "Merely Mary Ann" over again
In real life, with a denouement, how
ever, such as even that fanciful writer
â would never have dreamed of.
The plot in Zangwill's story and
play Is, of course, familiar. To Mary
Ann, the servant of a London lodging
house, there comes unexpectedly a
legacy of some millions, which the girl
accepts and leaves service to be made
into a model heiress. Well, to Mary
Meyer, who is a servant in a South
German household, there also has
come a legacy of some millions, but
ehe has refused it and elected to re
main a common domestic
The first act of this sensational ro
mance was enacted a quarter or a. cen
tury ago, when a young man of good
family named Norbert Meyer con
tracted a secret marriage with the
pretty governess of his younger
brothers and sisters. He was 25 and
she was IS. He was dependent on his
father for his entire Income and she
had nothing but the clothes in which
the stood at the altar. In these cir
cumstances the young couple who had
married for love alone had a hard
struggle. Norbert's allowance did not
suffice for the maintenance of a wife
and the coPt of an apartment and soon
he was plunged into debt. Things
vent from bad to worse until six
months after his wedding he was com
pelled to disclose the secret to his
father and to apply to the Btern parent
for money wherewith to pay his debts.
GIVES UP ins WIFE.
The father, a man absolutely with
out feeling, took a harsh view of the
case. Starting from the assumption
that the governess was an unscrupul
ous adventuress, who had plotted his
ton's social ruin, he declined to settle
the debts unless his son immediately
abandoned his young wife and prom
ised to have nothing more to do with
her. Young Meyer refused these terms
at first, but necessity drove him to re
open negotiations Â«ith his father.
In his desperate position young
Norbert Meyer surrendered and in
formed his wife that he must desert
her. In accordance with his father's
instructions he offered to pay her the
sum of J7500 if she would consent to
a divorce.
Wounded in her pride and unwill
ing to force herself on a husband who
was ready to abandon her, Mrs. Meyer
accepted the bargain after a tearful
appeal for loyalty. The sum of $7500
seemed to the ex-governess to be a
solid fortune and it never occurred to
her to utilize the opportunity of secur
ing better terms for herself. In dut
course the divorce proceedings were
initiated on both sides and a legal
reparation was arranged. Mrs. Meyer
had given birth to a daughter, who
received the name of Mary and Is the
heroine of this strange story from the
banks of the Rhine.
Mrs. Meyer, however, felt little or
no motherly love for her daughter.
On the contrary, she conceived a
strong dislike for the unfortunate
baby sfmply because it was the child
of the husband who had humiliated
and deserted her. About a year after
the birth of the baby Mrs. Meyer in
trusted it to the care of a peasant
woman, to .whom she paid the sum of
?5 a month for Its maintenance. Soon
this tax on her slender income be
came irksome to her and she disao-
peared from the neighborhood, leav
ing her little daughter in the care of
the peasant woman, who naturally re
fused to be burdened with the main
tenance of a child which had no
claims on her whatever. After wait
ing a few months for the reappear
ance of the mother the peasant wom
an handed over the little girl to the
nearest public orphange, In which she
was reared and educated.
The life of the little pauper was not
a happy one. She grew up under
strict and harsh discipline, wearing
an ugly uniform as a token of her de
pendence on public charity for her
maintenance. At the earliest possible
age she was obliged to do household
work, sewing, washing and other du
ties. Scarcely had she passed hei
fourteenth birthday when she was
sent out into the world to earn her
own living as a domestic servant.
The next seven years of her life were
one long round of continuous drudgery.
She was kitchen maid, house maid, nur
sery maid and maid of all work in turn
In a succession of modest homes. Her
earnings never exceeded $5 a month and
were often considerably less. She never
had more than two or three hours' rec
reation on one single day In a fortnight.
Her lot was hard and her prospects In
life hopeless. Finally at the age of 2i
she obtained a position as domestic
servant in the house on the banks of
the Rhine in which she is still living.
Her master and mistress are a vener
able old couple who contrive to con
tribute to the happiness of those de
pendent on them. It is not a large
house, but . it . is. situated in its own
grounds of two acres in extent. Be
sides Mary Meyer, there_Js a cook and
a gardener who helps about the house.
There is an atmosphere of perfect
peace and contentment round about the
whole establishment. The old couple,
we will call them Schmidt for they
strongly object to the publicity which
has been indirectly forced on them
through their unique domestic servant,
live harmoniously together and create
harmonious conditions in their vi
cinity.
They regard their servants as t mem
bers of the household in quite a* patri
archal fashion. The latter are treated
with dignity and never have the feel
ing that they lose their self-respect.
Mary Meyer, who has now been em
ployed in this exceptional household for
seven years, earns a monthly wage of
$5. t \ Her work is light, but Includes
sweeping and scrubbing floors. For the
last two years she has been engaged to
be married to the young gardener, who
is only slightly older than herself. As
a domestic servant she could hardly
wish for anything better, but it was
certainly to be expected that she, like
any other mortal, would jump at the
chance of being transformed from a
dependent wage earner Into a full
blown "millionairess." \,
During the quarter of a century
which has elapsed since Mary Meyer
was cruelly abandoned by her parenfs
great changes took place In their
lives. Her father contracted another
marriage; according to the wishes of
his parents, and became , a wealthy
man. His marriage was childless, and
turned out to â  be unhappy in other
ways, and as years went on he becamr
conscious of a desire to ascertain what
had become . of r the . daughter born tc
him before his divorce.
He instituted a search, but it was
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1904:
unsuccessful. When he â  died a year
or two ago he made his daughter
Mary his sole heiress, subject to the
payment of an annual allowance to
his first wife, if she could be found.
His second wife had died before him.
After his death his lawyers were
faced by the difficult task of ascer-

FUSED A FORTUNE. AND HEI
MASTER AND MISTRESS.
talning the whereabouts of his di
vorced wife and deserted daughter.
Meanwhile Mrs. Meyer-', had also
contracted a second marriage with a
man, who gave her wealth and posi
tion. As years went on she, too, was
troubled by her conscience regarding
the fate of her daughter, 1 but she
feared- to start -investigations, for; she
felt that, she could never, confess to
her husband how she had callously
neglected her maternal duties. In
course of time, however, her husband
died, leaving her a - comfortable ; for
tune and some solid house: arid land
property. She, too, had been, child
less in her ...second marriage, arid
when she was left' alone in the world
she felt a ponging to be united to her
deserted daughter.
SEARCH BEARS FRUIT.
While she; was engaged in search-
Ing forher lost daughter her first hus
band's lawyers succeeded in\ tracing
her, and from . that. time, she co
operated with them in hunting for
the srlrl who had "become, a double
heiress. Step by step they, traced her
course in life, from the cottage of
the ; peasant woman, long dead and
almost forgotten, to the orphanage
and through successive phases of her
career as a domestic drudee to the
home on the banks of the Rhine,
where she had found happiness.
On a fine summer morning a few
weeks ago the mother and the law
years appeared at the Schmidts'
house. and announced to the > aston
ished lady and gentleman that their
servant, Mary Meyer, was the heiress
to two considerable fortunes. After
the romantic story had been made
clear to them Mary Meyer was sum
moned and informed that her long
lost mother was there in person. The
meeting was not marked by any great
cordiality. Mary was shy in the
presence of the grand lady, and her
mother, on her side, was roughly dis
illusioned. It had been interesting
enough to conduct the complicated
search for the lost,daughter, and the
romance of the whole thing had ap
pealed to , her strongly; but it was
an unpleasant shock to see the daugh
ter wearing the attire and possessing
the inferior manners of a mere
menial. Her . enthusiasm was killed
in, a moment arid she left the lawyers
to explain the situation to the. girl.
.Mary,-: Meyer now learned that ,-her
father had left his entire fortune to
her, amounting to over a million marks.
Her- mother was, willing to make her
heiress to' her, own large fortune if
Mary I would come ;' and live .with her
as her daughter. The prospect did not
appear In . the least alluring - to the
simple-minded domestic, servant." Alone
among her sex, she experienced no de-
Bire to ; be able to buy fine dresses and
drive out in a, gorgeous carriage with
liveried coachman and footman to mark
her grandeur. She perceived ,at once
that if she became rich and went to live
with her mother she would certainly
be prevented from marrying her sweet-'
heart, the John. Within
twenty-four hours she . had , resolved
to reject the wealth and to refuse her
mother's offer. * -* i 1
The lawyers came - and Impressed
upon her the appalling folly of, her de
cision to reject wealth and prosperity.
Her. master and mistress emphasized
the gravity of . her choice, which she
would almost certainly regret in. years
to come. If her mother had exhibited
real feeling and aj*eal desire to reclaim
her daughter; Mary Meyer would pxob
ably have been persuaded, but her
mother remained aloof and did not at
tempt to influence her.
So the wonder came about that the
domestic servant, Mary Meyer, signed
a document rejecting th> legacy of her
father's wealth and another document
testifying that she had no desire to
live with her mother or to became her
mother's heiress. Mary Meyer, who
could be a millionairess, remains a do
mestic servant with a monthly â  wage
of five dollars. In a few weeks "she will
become the bride of John, the gar
dener, whose . earnings" amount to five
dollars :a,,week. s She will inhabit a
cottage of four sjhall rooms and will
have, only- the remotest chance of; ever
experienced ; anything more cheerful
than; abject poverty. . :

LONDON, Dec. 3.â Still westward the
course of empire takes its way. France
has long exercised supreme gastronomic
sway over the fashionable British stom
ach, but now America threatens to suc
cessfully dispute her rule. A significant
sign of the impending change is seen
in the number' of American recipes â
with American names attached to
them, tooâ which , figure in up-to-date
menus at smart dinners and luncheons.
They are more particularly noticeable
in the matter of salads, desserts and
what, one might- term the frills of the
table as distinguished from the coarser
viands which suffice to satisfy the mere
cravings of hunger. It Is on such things
that" the â¢ true culinary artist - depends
for his best effects, which leave behind
them a haunting memory of gastro
nomic Joys. It'ls to the Waldorf-Asto

chefs now look most keenly for ap

tion in London has for some years been
held by an American house. It. is there

INTO SOCIETY
IN A SEDAN
ORIGINAL MAIDEN
SOON TO WED.
LONDON, Dec. 3.â Society folk here,
particularly the Americans, are look
in? forward to the debut as a hostess
of Miss Queenle Causton, whose en
gagement has Just been announced, for
they expect her to introduce many
charming innovations into the business
of entertaining. This witty and beau
tiful girl, who is the daughter of
George Causton, and who will become
the bride of Captain Oakes of the Fifth
Royal Irish Lancers, has greatly im
pressed the fashionable world by her
originality.
Her coming out ball, two years ago.
was one of the really notable events
of its season. . It occurred at her
father's handsome town residence in
aristocratic Upper Brooke street, and
was marked by a charming novelty of
Miss Causton's own devising. When
the guests had all assembled she was
brought into the ballroom In a quaint
old sedan chair of the kind much af
fected by our fashionable grandmoth
ers. It was decorated Inside and out
with superb white roses, and the arms
of the supports were festooned with
rings of the same beautiful flowers.
Stepping forth from this antique con
veyance, the white-robed debutante
made her bow to society and distribu
ted the roses as mementos of the oc
casion. In one of the cotillon figures
th? girls wore the rose garlands as
bracelets on their arms. Ever since
this picturesque debut Miss Causton
has been one of the reigning favorites
in society. At this ball, by the way.

At the last meeting in November of
Mission Hive of the Ladles of the Mac

was a fair attendance of members, and
during the evening suggestions were
offered for the carrying on of a cam
paign of extension by the members of
the hive. During recess the meeting
was addressed at some length by Sir
Knight 'E. C. Stock of Golden West
Tent, K. O. T. M., on "Loyalty to the
Order."
After the close of the meeting there
was a pleasant social hour. This hive,
which at one time was one of the most
active of the fraternal organizations in
the Mission district, proposes by the
active work of its ; members to regain

"Modern American conditions and
music? Never was a time so pregnant
with musical impulse, never were
these conditions so vitally favorable to
musical creation. The ground is not
even scratched yet! The big things
that are clamoring to be done, the
doers that are putting out strong hands
to themâ"
But let me introduce the speaker,
whose prophylactic philosophy is par
tially outlined above. It was Mr. Ar
thur Farwell, optimist, delightful and
extraordinary â the optimist practical,
be it said. Mr. Farwell is among the
leaders cf the younger school of Amer
ican composers, author of several
songs, former lecturer upon music at
Cornell, and authority on Indian and
other native American music, upon
which he lectures, and upon which he
Is here lecturing at Stanford and Cali
fornia universities and elsewhere.
More, Mr. Farwell is here studying the
California^ musical output, particular
ly in its earlier Indian and Spanish-
American phases, though with a wide
and discerning eye for the modern
work.
Those unhopeful for the future of
American music should avoid Mr. Far
well. He would probably have the un
comfortable effect of shocking them
out of their pessimism. Not -vhat has
been done, perhaps not what "is be
ing"âmay L Mr. White? â done. but.
â¢what must be done from the American
musical premises, is the lecturer's
It was a little difficult to believe one
self in a busy, noisy, everyday news
paper office while he talked; for It was
there we had our chat. The suitable
surroundings would have been a tem
ple of art, with a Grail or two swing
ing alcft, and the large, clear-vlsioned
eyes of the speaker looking out from a
head set on shoulders clad in lion
ekins. I know I am mixing my Wag
ner, but what matters It? There is a
good, deal of the Siegfried suggestion
about Arthur Farwell. One fancies
him with a sword out for American in
differentiEm, orâ but judge for yourself.
Perhaps we began first to talk about
Humperdinck. with whom the com
poser chiefly studied. I told him we
had had the "Hansel and Gretel" at
the Tivoii. and in turn he told me of
the "Konigskinder," the heroic experi
ment that Humperdinck made in a
musical accompaniment to spoken
drama. It was a failure, through the
lack of vitality on the dramatic side.
Mr. Farwell spent a whole winter with
Humperdinck at his own home in the
little village of Boppard on the Rhine,
under conditions that he described as
ideal from the student standpoint. He
had much to say in this connection of
Hans Phitzner, worshiped of Humper
dinck, who with James Grun, his li
brettist, he says, forms a sort of com
posite Wagner. "Tremendous friends
and enemies" testify to the vital qual
ity of their art. Gullmant in Paris aft
erward contributed a contrapuntal
â¢juota to the young man's education,
and he came home then to lecture on
music at Cornell.
"Up to then," /Jr. Farwell put it, "I
had desired simply to express myself,
and had no broader purpose."
"You play, too?" I asked, looking at
the firm, artist hands.
"Oh, I played violin from the time I
was 9 years old," he replied, "but not
seriously." He smiled as he said then.
"I came from Minnesota, and didn't
know what music was until I got to
New York. I went there to take a
course in electrical engineering, but dis
covered almost immediately that what
I wanted was music. The piano? Oh,
that I do not pretend to playâ only in
illustration of my lectures."
"Well, you couldn't play it worse than
Walter Damrosch." I consoled. Mr.
Farwell was looking: apprehensive lest
he be thought to think that he was a
pianist. Then I asked:
"How soon was it before you decided
to devote yourself to the study of the
native American resources?"
"Right off," he said. And that, was
the way it must have been. The Far
well methods are enormously energetic,
quick and decisive as his terse, fluent
speech. - -
"I saw we were just at the beginning
of the creative period here. At first, of
course, everything was borrowedâliter
ally borrowed. Then came the imitative
epoch, now passing. And now is the
creative period. Perhaps a children's
song book, the Laurelâ that if you
haven't heard of j'ou are going to â first
set me thinking. The Wa-Wan Press,
that Is publishing what it believes to
be the vital new work of American
composers, went to them for children's
songs; not the weary old stuff that the
children have been fed on, but new and
genuinely American music."
"The coon song, for example!"
"There are worse things than coon
songs," Mr. Farwell put it. "It was,
however, in the search for these songs
that I came across so much of the real
stuff that was being written â and then
slammed on a shelf. Tou see," he leaned
over to emphasize this, "there had to be
this stuff. Here were young, virile
writers living a life that no : one else
has lived, in conditions crammed with
suggestion, and writing wholly out of
their own consciousness. They were
bound to do the new thing â and they've
done it."
"They?"
"Chiefly in the East. Henry Gilbert"
the 'lecturer replied, "Laurence Gilman
and John Beach, all the most radical of
revolutionistsâ it's quite '76 again," he
laughed. -
"Can any good come from Chicago?"
I queried then. Â»
"From Chicago! I found a sonata
there"â there was another "Kreutzer"
in the tone. "I must tell you. One felt,
of course, that in that great ferment
there must be music to voice it. But
there â as eveiftnvhere else, of course â
there is so much of the mere academic
stuff. Still, it took me three days only
to discover Campbell Tipton, who is
just about as big as the city. He had
written a piano sonata heroic â splen
did stuff. He had gone off into the
quiet, stepped back from the fuss, dis
mayed doubtless by the lack of altruis
tic feeling among his confreres. He had
had curious reasons^ Here's one, hard
ly credible: Tipton taught in a school
of music, and a friend of his teaching
in another put the Tipton sonata on one
of his recital programmes. He was or
dered to take it off because it was the
work of a man teaching In another
conservatory! But still it is not neces
sary to step back." .
"It Is good to go sometimes into the
wilderness."
Siegfried lifted the sword here to
this: "It Is not necessary to. desert

your kind. It is one of the fundamental
articles of my faith that a man may do
his whole sociological duty and yet
stand to his idealsâ don't care how high
they are."
I asked then on what lines Mr. Far
well thought American music would de
velop.
"Chiefly on the spiritual side â an evo
lution from the spiritual leadings in
"Wagner," he put it. "The emotional
expression has been done to the limit.
You can't go beyond the Wagnerian
expression of emotion. But the spir
itual side â "
"Just exactly what do you mean by
the spiritual side?" I ventured â "isn't
music essentially emotional?"
Mr. Farwell disagreed, suggestively.
"That music is essentially everything.
By its spiritual quality," he went on,
"I mean, technically, the harmonic
development. Rhythm, flrst dis
covered, Is the physical basis; melo
dy Is the emotional element; and har
mony brings tho spiritual essence.
With these at their flood you can sym
bolize anything in life."
"And we're going to do it, here?".
"We're going to do It here," he said
bravely, and you could not but believe
him.
On the native sources of inspiration
Mr. Farwell had exhaustive and most
suggestive comment.
"From the South we have the negro
.melodies â the South has been definitely
poetized therein for all time. The
West gives us the Indian songs, count
less thousands of them. In one tribe
alone, the Navajos, Miss Alice Fletch
er collected no fewer than 4000."
"And there are the myths," I sug
gested.
"The myths," the lecturer took "me
up, "that are as valuable to the poet
as the Greek myths to a Keats. Then,
we get the Southwest with the Spanish-
American genre, and yet another and
distinctly other element in the Span
ish-Indian. These I have been studying
all summer with Mr. Charles F. Lum
mls, your great Indian authority.
Then in the north one gets the French
and Creole besides other Indian color,
why â "
"Why, the woods are full of them."
I finished for him.
Very appreciatively Mr. Farwell then

Of exceptional Interest was the re
cital given last Saturday afternoon by
the Twentieth Century Club, devoted to
the compositions of Sir Edward Elgar.
The matter was fairly representative,
consisting of vocal solos, three part
songs for female voices and solos for
piano and violin.
One has been hearing much of Dr. El
garârlet us for brevity's if not for de
mocracy's sake so call him. All the
testimony seems to go toward proving
the composer head and shoulders above
his English confreres, his admirers, In
deed, hailing 'him as a sort of Luther
in a new musical reformation. Most
important of the musician's composi
tions so far is "The Dream of Geron
tius," an oratorio, that has met with
distinguished favor wherever it has
been heard. In it Dr. Elgar seems to
have succeeded in making sklllfulest
use of all modern musical effects, while
giving to his work all the exalted relig
ious spirit of the older oratorios. Well,
then, may they hall him a Luther.
The English musician has been pecu
liarly under the dominance of the
Handel, Haydn and Mendelssohn ora
torios. The English public has steadily
demanded that kind o% oratorio, and
the English musician has as steadily
endeavored to supply the demand. In
the famous Halle concerts in Manches
ter, where were to be heard the .great
moderns In "every other musical speech,
the "Elijah" and the "Messiah," the
"Messiah" and the "Creation"â but al
ways the "Messiah" â were given season
after season, and still are. Occasionally
"St. Paul" would be sung, and very oc
casionally a formal venture into the
oratorio field by perhaps Sir Charles
Villiers Stanford, Sir A. C. Mackenzie,
Dr. C. H. H. Parry, Cowen, Stainer
and Bridge might be heard.
Certainly the new oratorios offered
little temptation to the listener to de
part from the classic faith. Without
the genius that made the older forms
vital, they are crippled throughout with
the imitative weakness. But Elgar by
all account seems to have cut loose
from tradition. His "Dream of Geron
tius" has made an even profound im
pression, winning, a distinction for mod
ern English music that has only been
achieved, and that in quite another
field, by Sir Arthur Sullivan.
Peculiarly attractive therefore was
the opportunity afforded by the Twen
tieth Century Club. On the whole, how
ever, the programme was something of
a. disappointment. Barring the three
part song. "Fly, Singing Bird," that has
admirably the lyric quality, the com
positions given showed no great origin
ality, of the inevitable quality of music
ripe for birth and nobly born. Rather
is there an effect of striving â a feeling
after things in the dark. This Is par
ticularly apparent In the contralto solo,
""The Swimmer." One does not know
here what the composer is driving at
most of the time, and is left, also with
the feeling that he himself . is tossing
about hoping for some sort of anchor
age that he never reaches. The song is
dramatic in intention, but obscure in its
melodic story, and indefinite, unsatisfy
ing in Its harmonic plot. Miss Hazel
volunteer in behalf of her distressed
professional brothers and sisters and
will be seen with her company from
the Columbia in one of the brightest
bits from "Her Own Way." Williams
and Walker, the greatest team of col
ored comedians before the public and
direct from their London triumphs, will
be the contribution from the Grand
Opera-house, while the William H.
West Big Minstrel Jubilee will furnish
a good old-fashioned first part as a
curtain raiser.
Miss Lillian Lawrence, John Craig
and the principals of the Alcazar Stock
Company have a delightful surprise in
store for their many . admirers, and
Herschal Mayall, the popular leading
man of the Central Theater, will be
seen In the trial scene from "Robert
Emmet." The Tivoll Opera-house has
promised the grand sextet and chorus
from "Lucia," with Madame Fannie
Franclsca in the title role with Paul
Stelndorff directing, and the Orpheum's
contributions will be the best turns
known . to modern vaudeville. The
Chutes also will send' in a novel fea
ture.

the overture will be played at 1 o'clock
sharp. There, has been a large sale of
tickets and the reservation of seats will

Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock.
Mrs. FIske, now appearing In "Hedda
Gabler" in New York, has fascinated
therein even William Winter, who has
heretofore only impatiently considered
the actress in Ibsen parts. He says her
performance is remarkable, "being mor
dant with sarcasm, -keen with irony,
dreadful with suggestion of subtle,
watchful wickedness, and bright with
vicious eccentricity." The general rep
resentation, too, is declared to be bet

But the two three-part songs, both for

of exceptional value, particularly the
aforementioned "Fly, Singing Bird."

original use of both vocal and instru
mental material. With its free and
fine melody and novel harmonic

DOES SMART SET KNOW HOW TO CONVERSE?
Conversation is the divine art of
framing, in words, one's thoughts â if
one has them â and inducing the other
fellow to do likewise. \At one time
jn the history of our great and glori
ous republic it was not expected ol
women to be able to hold conversation,
.beyond being able to know when the
psychological point was arrived at dur
ing courtship â which was largely { a
pantomime affair on the part of milad>
.âand when to say "yea" or â¢ > nay." And
'tis amply recorded that these same coy
damosels, so modest and so chary of
words to express their emotions, oft
times developed into the inexorable
fccolds. Hence, she who talks doesn't
necessarily converse. And she whe
converses doesn't always aay much.
But she's a trump if she gets the othei
fellow to talkâ end she's labeled on thÂ«
ppot a "girl who talks mighty well."
Alas'. Alas! For the vanity of â¢nan! In
the matter of loving notice â a suppos
edly feminine trait â permit Sally to say
unreservedly that men are as amenable
to iweet soothÂ«aylngs as are womenâ
almost â another instance of the simi
larity Of MX.
AÂ» to the presence of conversation in
the smart set, there is unquestionably a
famine â save indeed, in isolated patches
â and there when nurtured mostly by
men. Of the women who "belong"
there are not a baker's dozen whose
fertility of brain and facility of expres
sion render them good conversational
ists. Among the few I recall off-hand
are: Mrs. Mark Gerstle, Miss Marie
Well*. Miss Elsie Sperry. Miss Ednah
Robinson, Mrs. M. H. de Young, Miss
Ethel Haper, the Voorhies girls, Miss

Brown and â well, there's a rift in
Brown andâ well, there's a rift in
shatter j cfuse to sound their reverber
ating note. And thus may. there be a
few other maids and matrons, whose
thoughts and words fit as doth a glove
to my lady's hand, and whose converse
may be fitted to tÂ£e theme and hour
with dexterity and ease. To ber is the
ancient honor due of "being an Interest-
Ing conversationalist â â a devotee of an
art of ye olden day, that with letter
writing, as understood by our grand
mothers, is laid away in lavender.
And to cards â the omnipresent bits of
pasteboard â is much of the decadence
due. Cards are the executioners of the
art of intelligent speech. But what are
we to do about it? As well seek to
dispense with our daily bread as with
cards. Perhaps, some gay day we may
substitute pantomime- for conversation.
Of course, there's slang to fall back
upon should the smart folk forget its
English, which is a comfort. Seriously,
do many of your society friends use
pure English, and use it with ease?
Hesitation is confession, good friend.
However, the case isn't hopeless. 'The
Sequoia Club is helping out.

Superintendent Suggests In
novations to Be Introduced
in the Public Schools
Superintendent Langdon of the City
School Department yesterday received
circulars signed by a sub-committee of
school teachers of San Jose, containing
the information that the State Legis
lature at its next session will be mem
orialized to make provision for increas
ing the salaries of all teachers through
out the State. The circular is signed
by George S. Wells, Louis Bruch, Rob
ert A. Lee, H. M. Bland and J. F.
Smith, and makes an appeal to teach
ers to organize for effective work and
push the proposition to a successful
finish/ The circular continues:
"We 'desire to call attention to and
indorse the recommendations of the
Superintendent of Public Instruction in
his last biennial report and the action of
the biennial convention of the county
and city superintendents of the State
of California, held at Santa Barbara
on May 10, 11 and 12. 1904, in the mat
ter of *mendinp the laws of California
in the provisions for raising school rev
enues, to wit: That the State taxes
be increased so as to give a minimum
of f9 per census child instead of $7, and
that the counties that are not already
raising the limit of 50 cents on the hun
dred dollars of county school tax be re
quired Tb~ raise an amount sufficient to
give $8 instead of $6 per census^ child."
TELLS OF EASTERN SCHOOLS.
Superintendent Langdon yesterday
filed whh the Board of Education a re
port of his recent observations of
Eastern schools with a view to the fu
ture introduction of the best features
prevailing there Into the local depart
ment. In view of the fact that some
school buildings are to be erected in
this city under the recent bond issue,
Langdon discusses at length the archi
tecture of school buildings in New-
York, Cleveland, St. Louis, Chicago and
other cities. The report continues:
"The kindergarten, a part of the
school system of nearly all the East
ern cities, must soon become a part of
the San Francisco public schools. It is
considered by school officers and
teachers a great success and in no in
stance when once established has it
been discontinued. A kindergarten
might be established in some con
gested quarter of this city^and the sys
tem allowed to gTow steadily but grad
ually. Of <?ourse, an apportionment of
school moneys in addition to the
amount allowed for elementary and
h*gh schools should be made for kin
dergarten purposes. A recommenda
tion to that effect will probably be
made by the Superintendent for the
next school yeaj".
COMPULSORY EDUCATION.
"In the matter of compulsory edu
cation the Eastern cities are far ad
vanced. The schools of Chicago and
Boston are the best types. The Chi
cago school particularly has been very
successful in its work of reform. This
school is located near the limits of the
city, about eight miles from the City
Hall, on a tract of fifty acres of land
owned by the Board of Education. No
wall?, bars or bolts exist, it being built
on the cottage plan. It is claimed that
80 per cent of the boys are cured of
truant habits and started on the road
to good citizenship and that the mere
establishment of the school has great
ly reduced truancy in Chicago. The
per capita cost of maintaining and
schooling these boys is $7 35 a week,
a high figure, due to the small num
ber of boys and the great number of
employes necessary. In Boston the
per capita cost is 54 43 per weÂ«k, the
number of boys in attendance being
greater and the term of detention
longer as well. The' buildings and
equipment In Chicago cost almost half
a million dollars."
A meeting of principals will be held
in room 356, City Hall, next Friday
afternoon to consider matters pertain
ing to the May musical festival.

SUNDAY DECEMBER 4. 1904
POINTERS ON PUBLICITY.
OF to-day's issue of The Sunday Call there were printed more
than 89.000 copies, the high-water mark in the history of
the paper, and an increase of 6000 over the circulation of
October, 1903. Of this grand total not more than I per cent
.will be covered by office files, leftovers from agents, etc., so that
fully 88.000 copies go into legitimate channels of distribution, rep
resenting to the advertiser a potent, far-reaching factor in the suc
cessful exploitation of his business, varying in value according to
the kind of enterprise engaged in. r ~
The Call has always been a paper for the homes, with limited
street and train sales, but circulating to an almost exclusive degree
in the homes of the cultured element. The superiority of the liter
ary features of its Sunday magazine section over that of any other
California daily and the excellence of its art pictures have brought
to it the generous and general support of people of intelligent
discrimination. It is these special features of The Call's distribu
tion which, the careful buyer of advertising space must take into
consideration when securing a medium to place his goods in the
public eye. For any article used in the home there is no paper
published in this city which can offer better values than The Call
in advertising space, and no paper which can show so large a
circulation in that portion of the community which constitutes the
fixed and reliable patronage of the retail trade. For the faker and
get-rich-quick promoter and the unscrupulous advertiser offering
bargains in his advertisements which he does not give in his store,
The Call must necessarily prove an unsatisfactory organ of pub
licity, but for the legitimate tradesman it is without a peer. -
In this issue is produced a sworn statement of the Daily and
Sunday circulation of The Call during the month of October. This
must merit the attention of all advertisers. ,
The Call does not claim to have the largest circulation in mere
numbers of any paper of the West, but it does claim to possess a
type cf circulation the most uniform in character of any Western
daily, which, from the standpoint of the advertiser, is deemed most
desirable. The circulation books of The Call are wide open to the
legitimate advertiser wishing to patronize its columns.
THE BALLOT IN COLORADO.
THE news dispatches from Colorado have given but little in
formation about the actual condition of affairs there. Governor
Peabody has been represented as intending to do violence to
the law in order to retain his office by force. The actual condition
as shown by the Denver press is that Governor Peabody is not
doing anything. The Federal courts have jurisdiction of offenses
against the franchise committed at elections when members of Con
gress and Presidential Electors are chosen. The Federal court in
Denver has assumed this jurisdiction and already twenty-six accused
people are under arrest, one of them being a woman voter. This
batch all belong to the local Democratic machine, but it is not
probable that all the frauds were committed by the members of one
party. When the courts get through with the large number of
cases brought before them, it will be known who was legally elected
Governor, and not before.
It is not remarkable that Governor Peabody suffered politically
for his effort to maintain order in Colorado. What he did there
was done before his time in Idaho by Governor Steunenberg, a
Democrat and a very able man. His enforcement of the law and
protection of life and property by drastic means was necessary
to prevent anarchy in the State, but his action retired him from
politics. Instead of his being renominated, as the Colorado Repub
licans renominated Peabody, it will not even permit him to be a
delegate to a county convention, putting its ostracism of him ex
pressly upon the ground that he enforced the law.
If it prove that Peabody is legally defeated, yet it Is improbable
that the disorderly conditions with which he had to deal will ever
return to Colorado, so that the State will enjoy the peace he pro
cured, though it refuse him recognition for compelling order out
THE ARBITRATION MASS MEETING.
TO-MORROW evening there will be held in the Temple Emariu-
El a mass meeting, pledged to the purposes of international
arbitration. At the instance of the Pacific Coast branch of
the American Conference on International Arbitration, and under
the auspices of some of the most prominent men of affairs in
California, this meeting is called to the end that the West may
co-operate with similar movements in the East, looking to the sanc
tion by the Senate of existing arbitration treaties ready for con
firmation, and the promulgation of other and similar peace pacts.
Governor Pardce is to occupy the chair; the presidents of the
two leading CaWornia universities, the Judges of the United States
Gircuit Courts and well-known speakers of the community are
to outline the aims of the assemblage and plead the cause of arbi
tration. By the weight and dignity of the programme announced
it may be seen that the campaign to be inaugurated here pn the
coa?t has the inspiration and active indorsement of those best
calculated to judge of the trend of public affairs and to initiate new
measures of governmental action. Unanimity of sentiment on their
part \vÂ«Ii direct the sentiment of the State.
With die coming session of the Senate there will be made
a decision which will be permanent in its effect. Already there
await for Senate ratification arbitration treaties with Great Britain,
France and Mexico; Germany has signified its willingness, even
its anxiety, to be a party to similar action, and there are other
diplomatic negotiations to the same end under way. In Europe
the movement toward arbitration has been no less spontaneous and
general. If our Senate confirm this humanitarian policy the cause
throughout the whole family of nations will be given strong impetus.
Now that the United States has taken definite place, almost a con
trolling place, in the. councils of the world, it is imperative upon
our country to act in the forefront of advanced international legis
lation.
INSTRUCTING IMMIGRANTS.
IX his recently published book, "Imported Americans," Broughton
Brandenburg reveals some new and significant facts on the meth
ods employed by aliens for gaining admission to this country un
der evasion of the immigration laws. For the purposes of making
a special study of the phase of Italian immigration, Mr. Brandenburg
went to Italy, there became intimate with a family of peasants
which was making preparations to transfer their household gods
to America, and. as one of them, came over in the steerage and
passed through the tortuous channels of Ellis Island. His informa
tion thus gained by experience is instructive.
The first and most striking fact which impressed the author was
that the immigrants as a body believed that they would "have to
pay some moiiey to somebody" to gain admission to the promised
land of their desires. Fraud seemed to them to be obligatory; brib
ery the only lubricant for making smooth the wheels of passage.
Even those that had clear entrance to the country were wont to
make assurance doubly sure by trickery. This, because throughout
the whole of Italy the impression was sedulously sown by knavish
traffickers upon the peasants' ignorance that it was necessary to be
schooled and coached in the ritual of inspection so that the officers
at the New York immigration bureau might be easily duped into
allowing admittance to those otherwise failing in, requirements.
Mr. Brandenburg makes the assertion that in Naples a school
of this kind exists which has the moral support, at least,; of the
'â¦alian Bureau of Emigration and the Emigrant Coneress. a nrivat.V

society fostering emigration, and that it carries on the business
openly and without let or hindrance from the Government. He
quotes resolutions of this society, voicing the accord of its members
in "the necessity of instructing the emigrant."
In the light of these facts, which must be known to our Govern

FOR PURER FOOD.
BEGINNING with the new year the Department of Agriculture
is to inaugurate a new and vigorous campaign against the im
portation of adulterated foods from foreign countries. Acting
under the provisions of an act passed by Congress a year ago, Secre
tary Wilson has ready for promulgation an order making it obliga
tory upon all foreign producers of foodstuffs designed for the Amer
ican trade to provide upon the labels of the same an accurate and
complete statement of the quantity and kind of preservatives, color
ing matter or adulteratives contained in the goods offered for im
portation. Failure to abide by this new law will, of course, lay the
manufacturer open to the confiscation of his wares.
Though the enforcement of this act commits us to picking the
mote out of our brothers' eye while ignoring the beam that is in our
own, it may be welcomed' as the beginning of an agitation which
will certainly be prosecuted among our domestic food manufac
turers with equal vigor as soon as the initiative of the Department
of Agriculture gathers strength by practice. Discrimination against
foreign products is not the spirit of the programme for pure food.
From Germany and France have come repeated warnings in the
matter of the adulteration of American meats and fruits â warnings
which have been heeded by the interested parties on this side even
without Government admonition. The vigorous measures which the
Department at Washington has taken against foreign adulterated
foodstuffs will serve as a forcible hint to domestic producers and re
forms will be made, doubtless, before. the second step in the pro
gramme directs itself nearer home.
All of this will have its salutary effect upon the discrimination of
the consumer. The campaign for pure food has found its most
persistent opponent to be the indifference, of the people themselves.
When, however, the careless householder may read on the label of his
French peas that they were colored with copper, or finds that his
sardines are floating in cottonseed oil, he must, if he is not very
careless indeed, begin to sense convictions in the matter of eating
wholesome and unadulterated food.
MARRIAGE A RAFFLE.
WE must look to the West, the country of the wide horizon, for
novelties. The East has no closed season for Cupid and his
arrow and its open season for v divorce is well patronized.
There marriage is a lottery and the losers get into court while the
winners keep still. The philanthropist and the philosopher, the hus
band and the wife, discuss in public the issue of matrimony. One
lady imparting to matrons the ways and means of managing a hus
band says, "Feed the brute." A man talking to men about marrying
a wife says, "Clothe the bird in plumage gay and take her to the
theater once a week."
The discussion never ends. People rush into matrimony under
a bell of roses and rush out of it through the "divorce court, and are
glad and sorry by turns. But all this*has become commonplace and
it has been left for a citizen of the somber city of Tombstone; Ari
zona, to strike out an original path into the state of matrimony. He
has put himself up at a raffle. His advertisement describes him as a
valuable piece of conjugal property. The tickets are $1 each. The
whole number must be sold before the drawing. The money goes
into a trust fund to be used in setting up housekeeping after the
lucky lady draws the prize and leads him to the altar of sacrifice.
He gallantly puts no age limit on the ticket buyers and binds himseif
to deliver himself, bound hand and foot, as it were, to the holder of
the winning ticket.
His plan is original and suggestive. American ladies of fortune
have for some time showed a desire to marry foreign titles. There
are not enough first-class titles in the market to go around and meet
the demand. Why not in\Â»ke the assistance of the Goddess of
Chance and put up a good title at a raffle? This will give the girls
all a show, and it will involve a guarantee of the soundness of the
title. Some have been led to marry handsome men claiming to be
titled, who turned out to be membersof the entirely respectable guild
of barbers, and there have been .heartaches and headaches in con
sequence. Let a real Duke offer himself in a raffle, with the cer
tificate of a searcher of that, he is "the real Peruvian dough
nut," and such grievous accidents/ will not happen.

PERFECT EQUIPMENT
AND SERVICE WILL
END RAIL DISASTERS
Editor The Callâ I would like to say
a few words in reply to the old fire
man, L. H. Herald of Sonora, in The
Call a few days ago. He says, as an
old fireman, he thanks you for your
editorial of recent date on rail dis
asters and he is rightâ your ideas on
that subject are food for thought for
all railroad managers and men In rail
road work.
However, when Herald makes the
statement that railroad superintend
ents keep men in their employ Just
because .they (the men) are jolly good
fellows who rely on their luck instead
of merit for success, he shows in that
one sentence why, he is still an old
fireman instead of an up-to-date. Jolly,
good engineer.
I^Iiave been In the railway service
for~n!neteen years and I have never yet
seen the man who did his work well
and. faithfully who failed to stand well
with the superintendent, and I have
found, too, that the jolly, good fellows
were generally the brightest and best
men for their places and a wave of the
hand or a pleasant smile did not take
their minds off their work for a mo
ment.
The condition .of men in train ser
vice to-day, as compared with twenty
years ago, certainly shows them in a
class by themselves in the labor world
and In progress."
The traveling public has the train
men . to thank for most of the comfort
and safety it enjoys to-day. It is the
train man who has always insisted on
the betterment of the laws for his own
and the public's safety and I think, if
the owners and managers of railroads
would work more for perfect equip
ment and better service and less profit
for a few years, the terrible accidents
and loss of life we read of every day
would soon be a thing of the past.
The subject is too great to be handled
properly in this short letter, but the
public can rest assured the train men
stand ready and willing to help capital
bring about the proper â¢ conditions.
When too much is asked of human na
ture accidents will happen. .

HE MADE LOVE
TO S TORE D UMMY
It was James Lister's affectionate in
clinations that brought him Into trouble
at Cleveland the other day. He was
brought into the Police Court on com
plaint of Max Englander, a Loral n
street clothier. The charge was plain
drunk.
Englander said that while in front of
his store enjoying the evening breeze he
was astounded and horrified to perceive
Lister advance from the street and
place his arms about the waist of Eng
lander's clothing dummy. Too amazed
to move, Englander says that he stood
helpless while Lister embraced
dummy repeatedly, giving vent the
while to loving sentiments.
When at last he was able to summon
his energies to resist the attack of Lis
ter, Englander shouted for the police.
Lister pleaded not guilty. His wife
appeared in court with her small baby
and pleaded for his release. It was
finally granted by Judge Whelan after
a lecture to the amorous Lister.

FALLING IN LOVE A PROCESS
OF INDIVIDUAL SELECTION
BY DOROTHY FENIMORE.
THE theory that men souls and
women souls were made in com
panion pieces, each pair unlike
every other pair, and intended to
go together, is very pretty. It
furnishes romance with one more
decorative prop. It makes you and
me feel that we were honored by the
personal touch of a master hand.
Nor is "It such a bad theory to put
into practice â after marriage. It can
be used to advantage in strengthening
nuptial vows. In engagements it
would be equally serviceable. If
fiances were to believe universally that
together they stand and divided they
fall, because a shining fate has so or
dained ft, . less money would be spen^
on express charges for the return of
betrothal presents.
The trouble is this theory will not
stand the test of time and experience.
Its colors come out in wash, salt in
the water notwithstanding. Fact
proves its fallacy. It is one of the po
lite lies of our civilization, pleasant to
speak and hear, useful for, occasion,
but deceptive â no more to be trusted
than thin ice.
WHEN MAN COMMUNES WITH NATURE
Cjpfi MAN sat by the babbling brook,
II \\ He sought the forest's cooling shada,
/ A He pondered in the quiet nook.
IS l> For peace dwelt in this leafy grl&da;
And why, then, did he linger there?
His heart was wrung with wild despair-
The voice of man was here unknown.
He talked with Nature's voice alone:
"Why was I born, would I could die!**
The rippling waters heard him cry.
The gurgling streamlet still flowed on.
With gleeful bound went on its way:
But words sound from its tinkling tongua
The tortured stranger heard it Â»ay:
"For every man God hath some uae.
.Then why evade the world's abusa?
My duty to all men is known;
I oft flow o'er the rugged stone. >
Yet. on, my courage daunted not
The seething sea I haste to meet.
Where many isles its bosom dot
And stately ships my presence greet;
I help to carry commerce on,
I make the nations proud and strong, /
And many gems of worth I bide
Beneath my dark and rolling tide."
From out the forest's silent deeps.
The whistling wind now rises hlsh.
And as It o'er the tree-tops creeps
The wood is Hooded with Its cryâ
"I fill the vessel's spreading sail.
Propel it when men's efforts fall.
At times I rouse the sleeping storm.
And bid the smooth sea turn to foam;
When hot the air and calm the sea. ,-.:.
The baffled sailors pray for me."
The forest then with rustling leaves
Its song of cheer to all men sang:
The song came softly on" the breeze.
And through the air its sweet notes rang:
"I help to build the home of man;
And comfort bring to all I can:
The ship doth profit by my aid.
And much of wealth to man I gave."
"Why list to more." the stranger said
As toward the town he made his way,
"Why fear the sting or man's scorn dread?
The world shall know me from this day."
And from that time rang forth his fame,
And men spoke highly of his name;
As mighty waves it rose on high.
To roll and roll, but never die. âBrooklyn Eagl*.

SHAVING â -Subscriber. City. There

It is certainly not fair, when we
know better, to teach young people
that their hearts are like sleeping
princesses, which only one person in all
the wide world has power to awaken.
Why. every time they felt a thrill of
sentimental life they would be certain
the appointed hour had come for them
to sit up, rub the sleep out of their
eyes and follow whither their emotion,
heaven-sent, might lead them.
The idea is like a painted egg3hell
that has been blown, good to look at,
but nothing in it.
The distinction la not made clear
enough to the young that love and lov
ing are quite different things. Love is
the emotion one gets from the attrac
tion of another personality. Loving 1
means the mental and spiritual accept
ance of another human being for bet
ter or for worse. Furthermore, love
does wake up the heart as the fairy
prince woke up the sleeping beauty in
the fairy tale. But It comes aa an im
pulse.' and not as a person. In other
words It comes from within, asd not
from without.
Falling in lore is a process of In
dividual selection, and not the result of
some mysterious external force. A
lover cannot tell his sweetheart why
he loves her. But he would have no
difficulty in defining why he does not
love any other woman of his acquaint
ance .whom one might name. He has
found a woman whose nature is a
complement of his own. But this does
not make him a puppet in the hands
of fate. In loving he has not lost an
lota of his personality, or of his in
dividual freedom. If he had not met
her, he would have met some one else
who suited him as well.
I do not wish to destroy that kite
called sentiment. It is a joyous toy.
and better fitted than I am, in my
present form, for flying close to heav

must have a leng enough tall on it to
keep it steady after it goes up above
the housetops and into the wind. Thus,
the best piece of sentiment ever mada
is better for a few facts tied to it aa
ballast.
Here are my facts: Whoever falls
in love does it on his own responsibil
ity. We do not fall in love because we
have to, but because we want to. Yet
we are not wholly to blame for the
mistakes we make. We wera taught
to worship before a wanton little god
with bow and arrow. # A man's life

honorably without living honorably.
He cannot love wisely unless he has

"But every door is bolted."
Then Santa Claus burst into loud
laughter.
"You are 'indeed a^ poor sort of re
porter." *
The Christmas., angel stepped in
front of the bolted doors and before
I could guess what was going on he
already had entered. Santa Claus was
about to follow him.
"But," exclaimed I, "how can I go
with j'ou? I am no spirit. I cannot
go through the bolted doors." m
"Please, silence, my son," said San
ta Claus, "we will fix that all right.
Give me your hand."
And he took my right hand. Then
it seemed to me as if my spirit left
my body. Plainly I noticed my body
collapsing and falling to the ground.
Already I was entering the store
room in company with Santa Claus.
A splendid light pervaded. This light
ascended from the Christmas angel.
There on high shelves, on broad
counters and even scattered on the
floor, were stored innumerable toys
of all descriptions, /such as soldiers,
drums, guns, large tents, houses, most
expensive doll houses, dolls dressed in
silks and velvets who could walk,
open and close their -eyes and cry
"Mamma." And, besides, engines and
machinery of all proportions â who
can enumerate all these treasures?
Slowly the Christmas angel stepped
from shelf to shelf, from counter "to

Have any county boards been Intrusted
with the privilege of helping the peo-"
pie organize and sustain libraries
whose open doors shall continually^ in

never to have ; been broached or ' even
dreamed. Has the State, with breadth
of vision and liberality of purpose equal
to those of the New England States,
provided State aid of $100 or $200 to
each ' local library applying for. help In
the beginning, contingent, be it said,
upon due local support? Again a neg
ative reply must be made.
What then has been done : by the
State in its sovereign capacity to buile

counter. The farther he went the
graver and sadder became the expres
sion of his face. His forehead was
covered with clouds and he glanced
down with sorrowful eyes on all these
treasures. Suddenly he stepped for
ward to a small table, whereon a life
sized doll was seated in a beautiful
chair and beside it lay a most beauti
ful trousseau. She stared with her
glassy .eyes into vacant space. All
around her lay large-sized cardboard
boxes containing \ laces, ribbons,
dresses, perfumery and even under
wear, night caps, silk hose, kid gloves,
jewels, 'watches and other ornaments.
Two large tears were rolling down
the cheeks of the Christmas angel and
the face of Santa Claus assumed a
very angry look.
Up to this time the Christmas angel
had remained silent. Now, however,
he began to speak in a very mild tone.
His voice sounded sweeter than the
voifce of the most loving of mothers
expressing her love to her child. And
thus he spoke:
"They are destroying the souls, of
my beloved children. Already the very
smallest of them are brought in con
tact with temptation and are filled
with malice, jealousy and envy toward
one another. Instead of the children
receiving the benefit and pleasure of
dressing their dolls themselves, they
find them fully provided for by
strange hands. Oh. you foolish pa
rents, destroying the most beautiful
inclinations and ideals of vour chil
dren ! ' God has bestowed these upon
our dear little ones, and you, instead
libraries in cities after they have been
established by municipal'' authority.
It also authorizes the support of li
braries by general taxation. The .at
titude of the State has been purely
permissive. Any incorporated city
wishing .â  to ;. have a library . Is empow
ered to create one. . If a city chooses
to be without a library it is, appar
ently, no concern of the State./ By
rio /legislation has it defined it to be
the duty of any official to carry on
the general organization and promo
tion of such educational work. And
yet both State constitutions have pro
vided.that - "a general diffusion ; of
knowledge and intelligence being es
sential to the preservation of the
rights * and liberties of the i people, the
/Legislature shall encourage by all suit
able means the promotion of ' Intellec
tual improvement!"
Meantime, an unofficial body, the
Library Association of California, com
posed of librarians and friends * of ; the
library, cause,' is Incessantly striving to
of bringing them into view, are hiding
and destroying them. Oh, ye fools!"
Santa 'Claus all this while had been
listening intently to the words of the
Christmas angel, but now he feels as
if he must speak himself.
. "Look at all these dolls." he began.
"Do they not resemble the monkey
instead of beautiful woman, as they
are intended to, covered with all their
useless finery? See also those kitch
ens, all ready for use. thus leaving no
room for amusing, and play. In for
mer times'the bread for the dolls was
made by the hands of the little ones,
but now even meat of all kinds is had
for the asking."
And while speaking thus it sounded
as if he was using very harsh words.
At this the Christmas angel turned
and reproached him. v
"Pardon me. can I be blamed for
speaking so. when all* their faith in
me has gone?"
The Christmas angel bowed and
answered: "In every child playing
with a toy, however small it jnay be,
we can notice the drift to originality
in place of the worn-out imitations
which we see daily. Children grow
tired of seeing these artificial toys,
no matter how beautiful they may be,
and after a while they cast them
aside."
In the meantime" Santa Olaus, hav

counter, roared_put with a loud voice:
"Nothing 'but machines; even our
smallest boys are brought up to

lic interest In library extension. To
further these purposes library , confer
ences are being held from time to time

meetings, held at Sacramento on No

and timeliness was presented. It was
entitled "The Value and Work of a

pared by Inspector W. R. Eastman ot
the New York State Library^ at the re
quest of Joy Ldchtenatein, the president
of the library association.
This paper made clear the exceeding
value of a library organizer's work.'
Ever optimistic. in his pursuit, he must
have breadth of vision, keenness an*i
a genuine love for children â they are
the coming patrons of the library. It
seems as though such an official should
be the possessor of all the graces and
virtues, the , embodiment of manly
strength, capacity and wisdom.

Finally- they saw a display of sim

building blocks, wagons, horses, etc
With loving and admiring eyes they
glanced at these, and, uplifting both
his hands, the Christmas angel with
bowed head pronounced this benedic
tion:
"Blessed are you who are the chil

given the opportunity of enjoying
and improving the divine inclinations
of your happy nature. Yours is the

TWO ACTRESSES
COME TO GRIEF
Failures in London on Same
Day for Olga Nethersole
and Mrs. Brown - Potter
PLAYS DO NOT PLEASE
American Artists Koughly
t Treated by the Gallery
Critic of Great Britain
LONDON. Dec. 3.â Olga Nethersole
received harsh treatment when she
opened In "The Flute of Pan" the
other ni?ht, but it was not because she
was "booed" that the actress burst
Into tears at thÂ« end of the third act.
"Boos" there were in plenty, and the
hoodlumB who made them at tha ex
pense of two women have been roast
ed by the newspapers, who are asking
when this rowdyism at first nights will
be stopped.
It was, however, & series of loud and
significant ffuffawB which told Miss
Xethersole that her careful and ex
pensive production of Mrs. Craigrie's
latest play wjis not to be a success.
For these manifestations of amuse
ment came in the midst of a supposed
ly "jnoving" scene and showed, as it
had been show a that afternoon in the
case of the new play produced by Mrs.
Brown-Potter, that the audience was
not impressed in the manner which the
â¢*.uthor had intended.
The scene was that of a Princess ab
dicating her right to the crown of an
Imaginary Continental state In order
that she might retire into private life
"with the man she loved. It was a dif
ficult performance for Miss Nether
sole, who played the Princess, and had
to read three or four portentlous
â¢proclamations with big red seals hang
ing to them, and it was characteristic
Â©I the gallery crowd that it laughed
openly at the actress* discomfiture.
When the curtain rose again after
falling at the end of the act it dis
covered Miss Nethersole with her
hands over her eyes end her frame
shaking with sobs. But the fact re
mains that the gallery merely ex
pressed what the whole house felt
more or less almost from the begin
ning, rather bored amusement at what
was intended to be taken seriously.
PLOT WITHOUT DEPTH.
The piece begins with the Princess
proposing marriage to an old lover of
hers, who has gone in for Tolstoism
after being cast off by her, because she
needs a man to lead her armies. There
is an insurrection in her kingdom. He
consents on condition that she return
to private life with him after he has
brought i>eace to her land, and to this
condition she *agrees. So far so good,
but then we get a whole series of jeal
ousies on the part of the wedded pair
which the merest word of explanation
qn either side would have set right.
In this way sympathy is lost before
the play is half-over. Mrs. Craigie has
failed to redeem the slenderness of her
plot by brilliancy of dialogue. In short,
there was little enough in the work to
recall either "The Embassador" or "The
Bishqp's Move," and what led Miss
Nethersole to lavish money on giving
it a sumptuous London production with
an uncommonly expensive cast is not
clear.
ANOTHER POTTER FAILURE.
It is an unhappy coincidence that two
actresses, both well known to Ameri
cans and both engaged in producing
ambitious plays on their own account,
should have come to grief in London
on the came day. For Mrs. Brown-
Potter's experience with "For Church
or Stage" was little less unfortunate
than Miss Nethersole's with "The Flute
of Pan."
"For Church or Stage" is the pieoe
that the worthy Vicar of Gorleston,
who has written several novels under
the name of "Athol Forbes," wrote for
Mrs. Potter some time ago and describ
ed before its production as just a little
dangerous. Its hero is a clergyman,
who falls in love with an actress and
then, after several precarious weeks,
renounces her and goes back to his
flock. Although the piece was not with
out evidences that its clerical author
has some dramatic ability, it is much
too amusing, in an unintentional way,
to serve its extremely serious purpose.
For when a burly squire offered "the
gratitude of the whole parish" to Stella,
the actress, if she would give up her
ecclesiastical admirer, a frivolous aud
ience rocked with laughter and dis
ported itself similarly over certain epi
sodes, supposedly of a heart-breaking
nature.
In fact, the afternoon recalled that
historic evening at the same theater
not long ago when Mrs. Potter pro
duced her sister-in-law's "Golden
Light." It is another stroke of bad
luck for Mrs. Brown-Potter which her
friends will regTet while feeling that
It might have been avoided by a little
more discrimination in the choice of
a play.
NEW PLAT FROM PINERO.
It was understood some time ago
that Charles Frohman had gained an
option on everything written by A. W.
Pinero. hence there has been a good
deal of surprise at the announcement
that the first of British playwrights is
writing a serious play for George
Alexander. It will be remembered,
however, that "The Second Mrs. Tan
queray" and "The Princess and the
Butterfly" were first produced by this
manager. Alexander, by the way,
has had more bad luck of late." After
prosperous times with' "If I Were
King" and "Old Heidelberg" he has
backed losers in "Love's Carnival,"
"Saturday to Monday" and "The Gar
den of Lies." Now he is going to re
vive "Lady Windermere's Fan," by
Oscar Wilde. * - -^ â â â â :)'-.

PRINCESS WAS SANE WHEN
PLACED IN A MADHOUSE
Evidence That Doctors Who Commit
ted Louise of Coburg Were
Brfi>e<i by Her People.
PARIS, I Dec. 3. â With regard to
Princess Louise of Coburg, the medical
reports which led to her internment
in an asylum have been published.
The perusal of these documents suf
fices to show at once the rascality of
the Austrian doctors, who basely ac
cepted bribes from the husband of the
lady and allowed themselves to be in
timidated by the imperial entourage.
For over a month now the Princess
has been in Paris, coming and going
as freely as any women in the capital,
telling the story of her unhappiness
and of the persecutions of which sne
has been the victim with a clearness
and coherency which shows the pos
session of the sanest and most equable
of minds. But what the medical re
ports do not show and what she her
self has maintained silence upon is the
part taken by her father, the King
of the Belgians, the cruel and dis
honest plot of which his own daugh
ter was the victim.
Whenever she is questioned upon j
this part of her story the unhappy I
Princess always replies: "I don't want |
to complain of my father. When he
seees me perhaps his sentiments with
regard to me will change. He will un
derstand that he has been deceived."

ROME, Dec. 3. â Italians complain
that there are many works of art con

back. There is a law against taking
them out of the country, but even un
der the . eyes of the Government, or
when the Government chooses to close
its eyes, pictures, statues, holy water
basins, Delia Robbia ware, all sorts of
beautiful things, are being bought up
by rich foreigners. Italians go to Lon
don or Paris and are astonished to find
their native art, looking very home
sick, in the drawing-rooms of rich for
eigners.
If you are walking in Italy and ask
to go over any likely looking villa you
will certainly see something you fancy.
Ask the servant to sell it to you. Very
likely he will. His master is poor, and
he is poorer. No Government can really
prevent the poor from selling to the
rich.

Gordon Lennox she got a good-looking
husband, who is rich, and who comes
of a family that Insures, social distinc
tion in England, and .jvho has the
knack of writing or adapting plays
that fit to a "TV his wife's gifts for
comedy. Although "The Marriage of
Kitty" was by no means a dramatic
masterpiece, it succeeded mightily be
cause of the opportunities it gave its
leading lady to be saucy, piquant, ca
pricious and fascinating.
The! new Lennox play, produced this
week\at the Criterion under the Froh
man management, is much the same
order of things, resembling its prede
cessor even in the detail of having a
particularly good first act, and there
after thinning out appreciably. It
gave Marie Tempest her chance, and
she took It. Her quick wit, grasp of
character and remarkable command of
facial expression would have carried
to success a much less, satisfactory
comedy than "The Freedom of Su
zanne.','
The plot, or part of It, was suggested
by one of "Gyp's" neat, naughty stories,
and deals with the experiment of a
frisky young wife who got a divorce
from her husband because he objected
to her goings-on. Of course, when she
got her freedom she discovered that her
husband was a better fellow than any
of the re,st of her admirers, and she
wanted him backâ and got him. Al
though the plot Is so thin, the incidents,
dialogue and action are bright and
sometimes 'daring, as, for instance, in
the last act, when Suzanne, in love
again with her. husband, appears unin
vited in his bachelor flat. One of : her

discovered that the dainty silk stocking
also is wet. so that * after : due ; coyness

COSSACKS SURPRISE
SLEEPING FOE AND
TAKE EIGHT GUNS
Japanese Are Driven From
Camp in the Night.
DARING RAID BY DON INFANTRY
Brown Soldiers Who Escape the Bayonet
Flee in Panic From the Field.
MTJKDEX. Dec. 8. â All day Friday
Russian eiege guns bombarded vil
lages occupied by the Japanese to the
east of the railroads and early this
mornlr.g, to the west of the railroad,
Don Cossacks routed the Japanese
couth of Lidiatoun and captured
eight guns. This brilliant action, de-
Ecribed by a Chinese who, dressed as
a Cossack, participated in the at
tack, was as follows:
"When volunteers were called for
from two Infantry regimentseveryman
etepped forward and the Cossacks in
chorus asked not to be left behind
vhen the little parly was formed. The
order was given to depart at 2 o'clock
In the morning and all the men ad
vanced with extreme caution and in
dead silence, sometimes crawling and
sometimes running. The party di
vided and attacked the Japanese posi
tion from two sides. The Japanese
xvere sound asleep and they did . not
even have time to raise a cry before
ell was over.
"Again we advanced and soon saw
before us the outlines of a battery.
All the Japanese were asleep except
the sentries. We encircled the bat
tery and attacked the rear. The Jap
anese had not expected such an auda
cious and sudden attack and when the
Don Cossacks charged on a dead run,
followed by chasseurs on foot, the
Japanese were badly scared and un
nble to realize what was occurring.
They rushed, half dressed, from their
tents, only to be received by spear
and bayonet. The fight lasted only a
few minutes, when the whole camp
broke and fled in wild panic, leaving
eight g-uns in our hands. We had no
losses only one man was slightly
wounded. The Japanese left at least
fifteen dead and probably as many
more were wounded."
Crouching in rifle pits has so hard
ened the men to danger that they ig
nore it. Peculiar war sports are be
coming popular among the troops.
General R.ennenkampff's Cossacks
are still in pursuit of the Japanese
and have driven them out of the vil
lages of Intsagoudzy and Dapinduni
gan, taking many prisoners and rifles.
JAPAN'S TASK ONLY BEGUN.
Captured Fort Is Not Part of Port
Arthur's Inner Defenses.
ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 3.â A high
officer of the general staff who is inti
mately familiar with the fortifications
of Port Arthur insists that the Import
ance of the capture of 203-Meter Hill
has been overestimated. He explains
that this hill, which the Russians call
Visokaia, is situated west of the rail
road and belongs to the outer and not
to the inner line of defenses, which are
composed of permanent forts on Cano
cia Hill, or Sungshu Mountain; Hark
Hill, or Antas Hill, and Woodcock HilL
The Japanese are now only about to at
tack the main line. Just as occurred In
the case of Dragon Hill after the cap
ture of the Wolf hills.
The Japanese took the Wolf hills on
July 20, but it was not until four
months later (November 20) that they
â¢were able to reach the permanent forts
on the north and northeast of Port Ar
thur.
"How long the permanent defenses
will hold out after the loss of the oth
ers I do not venture to predict." con
tinued the officer, "but it is not unfair
to compare the situation with what oc
curred at Sebastopol. The last outer
defense at Sebastopol was carried in
June, but the capture of the Malakoff
tower did not follow until three months
later. Sebastopol had the advantage of
having never been completely invested,
and continued through the siege to re
ceive reinforcements and supplies. . On
the other hand, the natural strength of
the positions at Sebastopol were infe
rior to those of Port Arthur. The 203-
Meter Hill is twenty meters higher
than the permanent forts on the north
ern side, but it Is 2000 meters distant
from them, whereas the distance be
tween the llalakoff and the outer de
fenses of Sebastcpol was only 500 me
ters. I believe the Japanese will try to
carry the main forts by assault, and
failing: in this they will revert to sap
ping and mining."

"Asia for the Asiatics" Their Appeal
to the Chinese Nation.
BERLIN, Dec. 3.â The conviction pre
vailing in the highest governmental
quarters that Russia is fighting for all of
Europe in the present war is increasing
in strength and is affecting Germany's
attitude toward the belligerents, so that
her friendliness for Russia and her
coolness toward Japan grows with every
Russian reverse. The Government has
correpondence from China showingthat
hundreds of Japanese agents are pene

fighting for all Asia In forcing Russia

An opinion amounting to a certainty
holds the minds of those directing Ger
many's policy that a Boxer rising or
similar popular movements against for
eigners in China will be led by the
Japanese, who are laying the founda
tion for a vast Oriental empire that
might reach to the Urals."
READY FOR THE BALTIC FLEET
Warships of the Japanese Navy Are
in Thorough Repair.,
CHEFU. Dec. 3. â Evidence of the
preparedness of the Japanese for arÂ«
encounter with the Russian second Pa
cific squadron was seen by the of
ficers of the French steamship Binh
Thuan, which left Japan on November
50. They saw near Sasebo the bat
tleship Mikasa. unscarred and evi
dently repaired and repainted. Forty
miles south of the Shantung Promon
tory the officers sighted the battleship
Asahi, which was similarly rehabili
tated. The Asahi was steaming to the

The work of repairing the Japanese

The Supreme Court, in the appeal
of the German steamship Thea, char

DIVORCEE
IS SCORED
BY JUDGES
Woman's Career De
clared a Travesty
on Marriage.
Filth Decree Arouses the
Ire of the Jurists of
.Windy 'City.
Mrs. Layman, Who Was Wedded
Three Times to One Man, Is
Denounced.
CHICAGO, Dec. 3.â Degradation of
the marriage tie, as illustrated in 1 the
life of Mrs. Grace Snell-Layman, who
has just been granted her fifth divorce,
was denounced by the Judges to-day,
and a general law to safeguard the
sanctity of the marital relations was
urged.
"This . woman's career has been a
rank travesty on marriage and the sa
crednes of its obligations," said Judge
Brentano. "By five quick marriages and
divorces she has shown her utter ina
bility to appreciate the sanctity of the
marriage tie.
"This dragging of the sacred things
of life through the mire cannot but
arouse the liveliest indignation In right
minded men."
"Mre. Snell or Layman or whatever
her last name is at present has turned
marriage life into opera bouffe," said
Judge Mack. "It is wrong, absurd, out
rageous, of course, but there is no help
for it as the law stands. Mrs. Layman
can marry again as soon as she can
find man with temerity enough to take
the risk."
Judge Dunne said: "It is absurd and
ridiculous as a general problem, but I
hesitate to discuss it at this time, for
fear of being construed as assailing a
woman."
Mrs. Layman was married first when
she was 16 years of age to Frank Cof
fin, a dancing master. She got a di
vorce, and married him a second time
at the solicitation of her son, now dead.
The second venture ended in divorce
also, but having acquired the habit of
marrying him, she married him a third
time. Again -she tired of him, got her
third divorce and married a man named
Walker, who claimed her as his wife
fQr one year. After divorcing Coffin for
the third time the woman left her beau
tiful homes vat Antioch and Racine,
Wis., and betook herself to Riverside,
Cal., where she has since resided.
Layman was a clerk in the hotel at
Los Angeles where the woman stopped.
She is under 40 and still pretty. She is
said to be contemplating a sixth mar
riage.

Names Larnegie as uuaraian of Her Estate
CLEVELAND, Dec. 3.f-Success,Â° if ap
pears/ did not always crown .Mrs..Chad
wick's efforts to raise ihjney. ..The fol
lowing story was told to-day by a mem
ber of a large firm of lawyers: Mrs.
Chadwick' called on this attorney two
years ago and explained that she was a
niece of Frederick Mason, a lifelong as
sociate of Andrew Carnegie. This uncle
had made her heiress to his fortune,
worth from $5,000,000 to $7,000,000, and
it had been cared for by the ironmaster
himself until its proportions were, at
the time of the interview, , $11,000,000^
On account of press of his own affairs,
however, he was desirous of relinquish
ing custody of it and had named this
attorney as a safe man. She said that
Carnegie's suggestion was that the es
tate be used to form an immense trust
company, so that she could never make
inroads into the principal.
Soon afterward the senior member
of the firm was called to New York by
Mrs. Chadwick, who exhibited to him
a document which terminated the
trust of Carnegie. But Mrs. Chad
wick decided to let the matter rest
until Carnegie returned to this coun r
try, saying that she did not like the
idea of instigating his return of the
estate.
'. Soon she wanted to borrow $40,000
from this ; attorney, explaining that
her quarterly dividend was not due
for thirty days and an obligation was
pressing her. '
The; attorney explained that that
night he was going to New York on
business with Carnegie for another
client and was quite willing to take
up the subject of the trust company.
Mrs. Chadwick, he says, asked him
not to mention, the matter to Car
negie, as she would be accused of be
ing^ foolish - withVher money. There
upon the attorney destroyed - the
papers , organizing the huge trust
company. ,

"The principal reason that prompt

A story was published In an even
ing paper to the - effect that several
.detectives alleged to be in the employ
of a New York millionaire whose
name has been mentioned in connec
tion with the Chadwick case are
shadowing Mrs. Chadwick.
An interesting feature of the case
to-day was the optimistic view taken
by. the Chadwick- counsel. Philip Car
penter said emphatically that his client
was a very wealthy woman and amply
able to meet every just claim against
her. Judge. Albaugh of Canton, who
is guarding the Chadwick Interests in
Ohio, expressed confidence in the, opin
ion that she would "come out all right
in the end.'*
CONCEALS HER BELONGINGS.
In contradiction of the statement of
Carpenter, Deputy Sheriff Frank C.
Rlnn said to-night that he served the
attachment on Mrs. Chadwick person
ally to-day, after first serving it on a
clerk and Manager Harriman of the
Holland House. Rlnn says that he
was permitted to go to the Chadwick
apartments, where he found Mrs.
Chadwick reclining on a couch. Ow
ing to her deafness, Rinn says he was
obliged to carry on conversation In
a loud voice. When he made his er
rand known Mrs. Chadwick took the
papers and placed them on a table
beside her. He continued:
"I, too, searched the room as well as
I could, but all I could find was a
small . handbag and the woman's hat
and jacket. We have been informed
that ' Mrs. Chadwick has changed her
apartments in the Holland House
three times. We believe that the hand
bag that I found in her room does not
constitute all of her effects. We shall
go to the hotel on Monday morning and
Inform the management that we want
from it a statement of whatever ef
fects they have belonging to Mrs.
Chadwick, either in the way of valu
ables deposited in the safe or a parcel
such as might be contained In her
trunks."
Mrs. Chadwick ,is said to be in a
state. bordering almost on collapse to
night. The nervous strain of the last
few days has been so great that she
is hysterical. Dr. Moor, her medical
attendant, was called in to-night and.
after prescribing . for her, said :
"Mrs. Chadwick is suffering from
nothing except the nervous â strain
which she has .been undergoing. It
is no, wonder that a woman of her
age should give way, considering
what she has been through lately.
There Is. however, \o constitutional
trouble." _ :.26

THRILLING MURDER CASE
BEFORE ITALIAN COURT
TRAGEDY IN GUILTY LOVE
Count's Death FinallTj Laid to Plot Involving
Wife, Her Brother and Her Lover.
TURIX, Dec. 3.â In the little Assize
Court at Turin the prosecution of the
Countess Bonmartini, her brother, her
lover, and ttfo other persons, charged
with A the murder of her husband, is
now proceeding under circumstances of
particular grimness. The cramped, ill
lighted Assize Court is historic in it
self. In the days when Turin used to
be the capital of the kingdom of Pied
mont, this was the Senate chamber,
wherein many a stirring scene was en
acted.
None, however, approached those
that are now of dally occurrence in the
terrible drama, whose tangled web of
love, passion, intrigue, conspiracy and
murder the law is engaged in unravel
ing.
The evidence against the Countess
Bonmartini. and the others took the
police over two years to gather and the
letters bearing on the plot alone fill
twenty-five folio volumes. Twenty-one
lawyers, among them some of the most
distinguished counsel of the Italian
bar, are fighting, on one side or the
other, the legal battle of life or death.
Nearly four hundred witnesses have
been subpenaed and it is now thought
that the trial will last three months^
Conflicting versions have been sent
to America of the story of the Bon
martinis. That story is one that ap
peals strongly to the Italian tempera
ment. It begins with love that found
its grave in marriage and was re
vived with another for its object. But
from these commonplace beginnings
of tragedy has been evolved a tan
gled maze of mystery and crime such
as only passion and fate, love and
h:ite. can weave. It possesses all the
elements of a great detective story.
It abounds in situations that would
have made the fortune of a novelist.
â¢-FATHER DENOUNCES.
In this drama, which culminated in
such a piece of human butchery as
could hardly be dignified by the name
of assassination, one figure stands out
in heroic relief. It is that of Dr. An
tonio Murri, one of the foremost of
Italian physicians and professor of
the University of Bologna. A Senator
at Rome and possessed of the old
Roman spirit of the supreme duty of
the citizento the state, he did not hes
itate to denounce to the authorities
his sonâ his only sonâ as the murderer
of Count Bonmartini.
His daughter, Linda, had married
the Count in 1891. Before that she
had had a love affair with Dr. Carlo
Secchi, one of her father's favorite pu
pils, but she appeared to have got
over that. For some years she and
the Count seem to have lived happily
together and two children were born
to them â a boy and a girl. Then in
compatibility of temperament and
tastes began to chill their -affection.
High strung and nervous, she ' was
intellectually ..much-_hÂ£r_hysband's su
perior, and he ci/a poor figure in the
society in which slie^ shone. Urged by
her to take up some serious study and
make something of himself, he went in
for medicine, but the result simply
demonstrated that his abilities were of
a hopelessly mediocre character. The
rift between them . widened. . It is al
leged that he consoled himself with
other women and treated her cruelly.
They separated for a time and then
tried the experiment of living together
again, but now there was not a ves
tige of love left on either side and mu
tual antipathy and contempt had taken
its place. Things were ripening for the
tragedy.
LOVER DISPLACES HUSBAND.'
About this time Dr. Secchi again
came into the Countess' life. He had
little difficulty in rekindling the old
flame and soon he held the place that
should have been her husband's. He
was a friend of her brother, Tulllo
Murri, who had become a barrister,
and filled the position of a magistrate
and municipal councilor at Bologna. It
throws a queer light on Italian society
that this brother, Instead of rounding
on Secchi, warmly espoused his cause.
Italian ways are not American ways,
and the fact that Secchi already had a
mistress and was a notoriously" im
moral man made no difference to
Tullio. ' .;â &,-
According to the prosecution, the
three plotted together to g^t rid of
thft Count. Tullio, it is alleged, in
duced his mistress, Rosina Monettl, to
take part in the evil game, and found
another ally in his friend, Dr. Plo
Naldi, who was hard up and willing
to risk his neck for money. Tullio, it
is alleged, conceived the idea, of mur
dering the Count by pricking him,with
a hypodermic syringe containing a
poison with which certain tribes of In
dians tip their arrows when they go
on the warpath, but Secchi argrued
that it could not be depended on to do
its fatal work quickly- enough and
proved it by an experiment of which
a lamb was the victim.
CUIiMINATION OF PIXXT.
v When the Count was discovered
dead in his palace there were no less
than thirteen wounds in his body.
Some feminine finery was scattered on
the bed,. there was the bloody Imprint
of a woman's hand on the wall and a
letter in a woman's handwriting,' mak
ing an appointment with him, was
found in the room. That letter, the
police declare, was written by Rosina
Bonetti, at Tullio's dictation, and with
the ffeminine apparel had been placed
in the Count's room to throw them off
the ecent by creating the impression
that -his murder was the sequel of a
vulgar â¢ intrigue with an abandoned
woman in league with thieves and cut
throats.' - :â :'â 
-Tulllo' and Naldl are accused of ac
tually killing the Count and the other
three- prisoners ot being accessories.
Not the least striking, of - the many
dramatic situations in which- the grew.
some story abounds. Is; that { which '.re
veals Tulllo; In his' capacity of magis
trate, leading the pollge Into the Cham-"
ber : of death and taking an . inventory
of Its contents.' " <â¢ "-' ' â¢....â¢>
It 1s a strange blending": of,, fate and
circumstances that brought { these five
people together and landed, them In; the
grim iron cage. The Countess and. her,
brother are the chief objects of popular;
interest and speculation." I-It Is orie r of
the puzzles of heredity that Dr.'AntonLo-
Murri, a model of rectitude, .well ; baK
anced, a vigorous man, both bodily and
mentally, should be the f ather .of two
such children. ' ':" i ; ,V ,
COUNTESS REMAINS -.CAL3IJ
The Countess owes nothing;^ her
powers of fascination to beauty. iASlfe
Is a little woman with swarthy 'fea'
tures and has ; lost the sight of one
eye. When the police, accompanied by
a lot of Journalists, came, to her*fath
er's house to arrest her, . she" took the
matter very calmly. In her dressing
gown she opened . the door of ; her room
and : invited them all to enter. > ;
"We air wept," wrote one of itlfe.Ital?
Ian reporters, describing ' the : scene . in
his: paper,, "but Linda /dressed,'
brushed her : hair and, with incredible
cynicism,, cleaned her_ teeth." Â£ â

Secchi. She wrote letters to him when
ever she got a chance; but sent no mes
sages to her father, who adored, her.
or to her two Innocent children. - In
court at times she- has- presented a
pitiable figure of a woman overwhelmed!
by sorrow and trouble seeking relief in
tears. Her mother declares that she
is Innocent of all complicity in her hus
band's murder. â <
CHARACTER OF ACCUSED.
Of all the prisoners Tullio Murri
shows the least concern in the proceed-
Inf s. He Is either absolutely shameless
or possessed of superb courage. Pro
fessor Lombroso, the great Italian crim
inologist. sayy that the formation of
his skull alone suffices to classify him
among the "irresponsibles." He de
clares that he is "neurotic" and tainted
with "that- latent: hysteria that is often
met with in persons of homicidal tend
encies." He reasons that Tullio. was
the slave of an "ungovernable Impulse."
generated v by the conviction, well
founded or otherwise, that his sister
had long been the victim of the. Count's
brutality. ~ . ...
Though his mind may be of the/ab
normal type, Tullio certainly .pos
sesses much energy and. ability.
Passing through the various staees of
socialism, he finally adopted the polit
ical creed of the , anarchist. That it
well suited him may be inferred from
the fact that he once composed a-trag
edy in verse in which all the characters
kill one another in the last act /
- Rosina Bonetti is also regarded by
Lombroso as an irresponsible. He says
she is hysterical, epileptic, neurotic and
half-paralyzed. She is the most pitiful
figure of the five. In court her eyes are
ever fixed on .Tullio, her lover, hoping
that he will bestow on her some glance
of affection, which he never does. Her
attitude suggests that of a faithful dog
toward an indifferent master. What
she has done she has done simply be
cause he told her to do it. That was
enough for her.
For Secchi and Naldi no sympathy
whatever is felt. The former was ar
rested lc-ng after the other four, 'when
he must have thought all danger for
him had passed. The greater therefore
was the blow to him. He is hardly
recognizable as the spruce, alert, well
groomed man he was before the prison
gates opened for him. His attitude is
one of complete dejection. It is not the
bearing that one associates with con
scious Innocence.
HEALTH INSPECTORS MAKE
A RAID ON MILK WAGON'S
Keep Midnight Vigil in Outlying Dis
tricts and Secure Many Samples
for Analysis.
Acting under orders of Health Of
ficer Ragan, four milk inspectors of
the Health Department kept mlditight
vigil in the outlying districts, lying in
wait for milkmen. Every wagon that
came along was stopped and samples
of . milk . weire taken for - chemical
analyses. . When the inspectors came
iulo the Health Department's labora
tory 'they were loaded down with bot
tles of milk. Dr. A. C. Bothe, super
intendent of the Pure Food Depart
ment, and Dr. F. G. Canney, bacterio
logist of the Health Department, are
now trying to discover whether the
milk has been adulterated, whether it
comes, up to the proper standard for
butter fats and whether the germs in
the milk are not greater than the num
ber prescribed for the public.
Dr. Ragan has had samples of milk
taken from the cans sent in by ship
pers. A chemical analysis of the sixty
or seventy samples taken shows that
the quality of milk sent into the city
Is better than ever before. The mid
night inspection is for the purpose of
ascertaining whether the milk is wa
tered after it is turned over to the
drivers. If this is proved many ar
rests will follow.
Dr. Ragan and Dr. Hassler visited a
number of dairies in the outlying dis
tricts yesterday and found deplorable
conditions. The dairies on Berlin
street, according to Dr. Ragan, are
filthy. He also found thirty cows graz
ing on marsh land and notified the
owner that if the cows were not kept
off the land he would be arrested and
prosecuted. He found cows feeding in
a corral that- was filled with sewage
and notified the. owner to have the
sewage deflected Into Its proper chan
nel and to clean up his place gener
ally. ;.;â  >:;:â¢

Dr. Eeicli of England, Says
That Maternal Influence
Is Absent in This Country
IMPORTANCE IS GREAT
Mothers, Says Physician, and
Not Societies, Are the
Heal Regulators of Nation
Special Dispatch to The Call
. LONDON, Dec. 3.â After one of his
university lectures In London recent
ly, Dr. Emll Reich was, reproached by
an American woman for some of his
comments in his Among Na
tions." .
"Madame," thundered the doctor,
tossing his leonine mane, "the United
States is in reality an empire, and
such defects as I have observed in the
American woman are part of the price
you" have to pay for being an empire.
If I were an . American woman I
should say, 'The man Reich may ba
right, but without these qualities of
American women the United Statas
never could have been what it is. They
were, the very qualities that were
needed for the occasion."
One of the weekly papers here got
up a symposium on the mothers of
famous men and asked Dr. Reich to
contribute to it, wfth a portrait of his
mother and a word of comment. His
comment Is so bristling with interest
that it is worth quoting .entire, as fol
lows:
"In lectures and In books," say3 Dr.
Reich, "I have repeatedly given ex
pression to my conviction that moth
ers are more Influential than any sys
tem of education or instruction.
Whether Schopenhauer is right or
wrong in saying that we inherit our
intellect from our mothers. It is inde
pendently-true that the ethical equi
librium so. decisive for our life can be
secured by. real maternal influence
more rapidly and more abidingly than
by any other influence.
"I do not hesitate to~say that the
maternal' influence is most
distributed among the various nations.
It is supreme in France, and in som'i
of the Catholic portions of Germany.
It is rather tame in Austria; spas
modic in Hungary; lacking tone in
England; absent In America; Jewish
mothers too frequently overdo it.
"The young Englishman, left early
to his own resources, falls victim to
brooding over ethical problems, which
the constant tenderness of a mother
can obviate, but no philosophy can
solve. Hence his constant hungering
for ethical teaching; the waste of
much precious time on attempts to
"arrange or judge, life according to
strict "principles, " and all the vain
strivings of so many young men to
makeup for the irretrievable loss of
maternal influence. Hence the eccen
tric absurdities to which movements
such as temperance, vegetarianism,
etc., are carried. The great regulator
of a nation's ethical nerves Is not 'so
cieties for ,' but the mother."
PRESS CLUB EXPECTS BIG

"King Dodo" Will Be Attraction,
Especially Embellished for News

The Press Club will have the Tivoli
next Thursday night â all of It, from

lyrics of the opera have a charm not
possessed by many of the later light
operas and the lines teem with brisk
epigrams.
But the Press Club boys are not en
tirely satisfied with the work of the
playwright. So "King Dodo" is to be
embellished. Finishing touches, hav
ing a club flavor, are to be made. The
lines are to be interspersed with local
Jokes and new topical verses will be
sung. 'Even the ordinarily dull Inter
missions will have their part. in the
merry-making â in fact, the best of the
side play is promised in the interims.
The newspaper men say there will not
be a dull moment from 8 to 11.
The annual theatrical entertainment
has become a feature of j the Press
Club. There will be new life to the
pretty opera next Thursday night. The
features will be additions, rather than
substitutions. The price of seats is
$1 and the advance sale is said to be
very heavy.

What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body in Health and
Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days, when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us our
dally dose of Bulphur and molasses
every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all, and,
inind you. this old-fashioned remedy
was not without merit.
The idea was good, but rtie remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any ef-
fect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial ef-
fects of sulphur in a palatable, concen-
trated form, so that a single grain is j
far mo e effective than a tablespoonful
of the crude sulphur.
In recent years research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
fo- medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
in drug stores under the name of Stu-
art's Calcium Wafers. They are small
chocolate-coated pellets and contain the
active medicinal principle of sulphur In
a highly concentrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health;
sulphur acts directly on the llver-'and
excretory organs and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elimina-
tion of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo-
lapses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary flow-
ers of sulphur were often worse than
the disease, and cannot compare with
the modern concentrated preparations j
of sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
"Wafers Is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles, and cure
constipation and purify the blood in a
way that often surprises patient and
physician alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilkins while experiment-
Ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from consti-
pation or malaria, I have been sur-
prised at the results obtained from Stu-
art's Calcium Wafers. In patients suf-
fering from boils and pimples and even
deep-seated carbuncles, I have repeat-
edly seen them dry up and disappear in
four or five days, leaving the skin clear
and smooth. Although Stuart's Calcium
Wafers is a proprietary article, and
i=old by druggists, and for that reason
tabooed by many physicians, yet I
know of nothing so safe and reliable
for constipation, liver and kidney trou-
bles, and especially in all forms of skin
disease, as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
â¢â¢purifiers" will find in Stuart's Calcium
Wafers a far safer, more palatable and
effective preparation. ""â¢. ":. ''.'â

FAIR HANDS UNVEIL A BRONZE
STATUE OF BLIND MILTON
DESCENDANT OF POET'S PATRON OFFICIATES
LONDON, Dec. 3.â It was a particu- j
larly appropriate selectionâ that of
Lady Alice Egerton to perform the task '
of unveiling the new statue to Milton in !
Cripplegate the other day. â¢
Lady Alice, who is the wife of the
Earl of Egerton, is also a descendant
of that Earl of Bridgewater who was '
Milton's stanch friend and patron. It:
was for the entertainment of his fam- >
ily â a very numerous one, by the way, j
consisting of no less than fifteen chil- â¢
dren â that the "Masque of Comua" *vas '
written. The story was founded on an
incident in the x life of the eleventh
daughter, herself a Lady Alice Egerton. ',
And when it was first performed at the !
Earl's castle at Ludlow it was she who !
was cast for the Lady. \
The associations of the family are not
only closely connected with the life of'
the poet, but with Cripplegate church,
in which he found a final resting place
and near which his new statue stands, i
The Earl who lived in Milton's day was '
a regular worshiper at St. Giles, Crip- j
plegate, and often helped ring the same
bells which pealed forth Joyously the j
other day when the statue was uncov- i
I ered. The town house of the Bridge- j
j waters stood on the site now occupied j
I by Cripplegate Institute, not far from j
I the church, and it is supposed that Mil- j
j'ton took up his residence in the parish
that he might be near his powerful
friend.
Milton was born in London, lived the I
greater oart of his life in London and j
died in London, but until the unveiling;
of the Cripplegate statue no monument '
to him existed in the city which is so
intimately associated with his fame. It
seems strange that for nearly two and
a half centuries after his death his
memory should have been thus neglect
ed, despite the fact that he has long
been proclaimed the greatest of Eng
lish poets next to Sliakespeare. But the
truth is, though English folk accept
this statement as a correct estimate of
bis place in literature, few of them read
his poetry in these days. It has been
said that several hundred shots might
be fired from a Maxim gun in any of
London's busiest thoroughfares without
incurring much risk of hitting any one
who could repeat from memory a single
line of "Paradise Lost" or "Paradise
Regained." Had not J. J. Baddeley,
deputy alderman of the Cripplegate
ward, offered to defray the cost of the j
statue it is quite possible that another
century might elapse before London
would have an opportunity to gaze
upon his effigy in bronze. The offer
was made conditional on $10,000 being
subscribed to the fund for restoring the
church in which he is buried. It took a !
year to obtain the money, which may j
be taken as a fair measure of the great .
Puritan poet's popularity at the present
day.
STATUE IS OF BRONZE.
The statue, which ha3 been molded
in bronze, depicts Milton in the prime
of life, when the plan of "Paradise
Lost" was more and more filling" his
mind. He is . represented gaz:ng
heavenward, as though seeking in
spiration for his great work, and the
pose renders peculiarly appropriate
the quotation inscribed on the pedes
tal:
O, spirit '. . . what In me is dark
Illumine, what is low raise, and support:
That to the height of this groat argument
I may assert Eternal Providence,
And justify the ways of God to men.
The sculptor, Horace Montford, has
taken as his portrait authority a bust
executed by Pierce about the year
1C54. '-*&'}
Perhaps among the work girls and
operatives who, from the serried win
dows of factories and warehouses',
looked down on the inaugural cere
mony there may have been some
humble descendant of the poet. All
trace of them has long been lost. Mil
ton's domestic life was not a happy
one. He was thrice married, but only
by his first wife did he have any chil
dren â three daughters. The first of
these. Mary, died unmarried. The sec
ond, Anne, married a builder and died
in giving birth to her first child.
Deborah, the youngest and best be
loved of them, was discovered in her
old age by the fashionable and literary

world of London living in dire poverty
and something was done to smooth
her last years. The last surviving de
scendant of whom anything is known
was his granddaugther, Elizabeth Fos
ter. Poor and sorrow-laden, she was
found at 66 in a chandler's shop In
Shoreditch. Dr. Johnson organized a
ptrformance of "Comus" for her
benefit. Something like $650 was thus
obtained. The husband and wife quar
reled over the question In whose name
the money should be invested. .
While Milton's descendants were lost
sight of in poverty and obscurity, his
patron's family nourished and pros
pered. Four Earls of Bridgewater suf
ficed to make the fourth a Duke, but
the Dukes ran out with the third of
them. However, he had a nephew,
who was George Granvllle, Marquis of
Strafford, and by and by the first Duke
of Sutherland, and to this nephew 'the
last Duke of Bridgewater bequeathed
the greater part of his immense prop
erty, including the famous picture gal
lery, valued at $750,000. There was a
reversion to the Marquis' second son,
Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, who
thus came in for something like
5450,000 a year and in due time was
created the first Earl of Ellesmere.
He was the grandfather of the present
Earl, the father of Lady Alice Eger
ton, who unveiled Milton's statue.
LADY ALICE ARTISTIC.
The family has inherited much of
the literary and artistic tastes of the
poet's patron. Lady Alice Everton
writes poetry and has brought out a
book called "The Lady of the Scarlot
j Shoes." But it is with her brush she
most excel?. She has become an art
ist by profession and has a studio of
her own In Drompton. The eldest
daughter, .Lady Mabel Egerton, and
the youngest. Lady Leila, are both ac
complished women, Â» who sing and act
' and are in great request in their own
1 exclusive circle. Lady Beatrice Kemp,
J the married daughter of the family,
Ls also a clever" woman with definite
opinions of her own, who reads much
and writes well, both - In prose and
J verse. Another daughter, Lady Helen,
i met with' an. untimely, death at 17. She
â¢was lying ill of some trifling malady
; at Bridgewater House when a. young
footman in a fit of Jealousy. shot dead
â¢ a housemaid. with whom he had fallen
'â¢ in love. The tragedy, .caused such a

RARE VOLUMES

Ancient Psalter and Bible

LONDON, Dec. 3.â "I suppose some
rich 'American will' get^ the Psalter,"
said a dealer In rare editions yesterday.
"They seem to be getting everything of
the kind now-a-days. But he will have
to pay a stiff price for it."
As a matter of fact it is expected
that the Latin Psalter of 1459, which is
to be sold in London on December 10,
will produce the largest sum ever paid
at auction for a printed book. That
seems likely enough, too, when one con
siders, the wonderful way In which the
value 'of this rare work has increased
In recent times. It is printed on vellum
and with wonderful capital letters, the
method of whose production still puz
zles the student, is one of the great
monuments of early printing. Twenty
copies of the Psalter are supposed to
have 'been printed, of which about a
dozen have been found. The present

One or two examples will show how
amazingly the money worth of the
Psalter has risen during the last cen
tury or so. In 1813 a copy brought $300.
During the next eleven years it doubled
in price, for in 1S21 a specimen owned
by Sir Mark Sykes brought $650. And
when; in 1881, the same book was sold

SLIT BEGUN TO RECOVER
STRAUSS INHERITANCE TAX
Another attack upon the constitu
tionality of the collateral inheritance
law is to be made by Attorneys Ga
routte & Goodwin for Philip I. Fisher,
who is assignee of the claims of Jacob,
Abraham and Sigmund Stern, heirs of
Levi Strauss. The Inheritance tax as
sessed agrainsU them was $39,500 and
when it was paid, under protest, on
June 23. 1904, with interest added, the
tctal amounted to $40,155 48. Fisher
sues City and County Treasurer Mc-
Dougald for the recovery of this sum.

REVISIONISTS
DISAPPEARING
Sentiment Favoring Changes
in the Tariff Is Hapidly
Dying Out in Washington
Soecial Dispatch to The Call
CALL. BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.â Sentiment
for tariff revision Is dying raptrfiy
as Congress Is about to convene.
Members of Congress ' who have
come to Washington from the West
appear to be putting in the fin
ishing: blows on the revision sen
timent by reporting that the will of the
people of the West is to be considered.
The tariff, it seems to be generally be-,
lieved, will be left as it is, at least until
the next regular session of Congress.
The tariff revisionists of the East
have represented the Northwestern
States and Pacific Coast States as be
ing especially insistent on some tariff
changes, but the representatives from
these States say that no such sentiment
exists. Representative Knowland of
California, who arrived here to-day,
says that in his State* there is no senti
ment for tariff revision. He declares
that he has not heard even a Democrat
there any that the tariff ought . to be
charged. . â 
Statesmen from Oregon, Washington,
Minnesota and' the Dakotas say that
they have found among their people no
sentiment for revision, although some
of them are pretty eager for some sort
of reciprocity with Canada. * A mem
ber of the Cabinet said to-day:. j ,
"You can stake your reputation on
this predictionâ There 'will be no revi
sion of thf. tariff w ithin p. year from to
day. It is becoming plain that the peo
ple are not rrtady for revision.'.' .' . "'.

SOME PEOFIT TAKING
November Proves a ... Banner
; Month, the Sale of Bonds
Amounting to $216,853,000
NEW YpRK, Dec. 3.â To-day's stock
market was strong:, but the strength
was uneven, and a few of the most
prominent stocks closed the day at
fractional declines from last night. The
strength in the market grew out of
conditions in the cotton, coal, copper
and iron and steel trades. Even in the
srrbups affected by these trades there
was some protlt- taking, as In Louis
ville and Nashville, which closed lower
after , erratic fluctuations. ,, United
States Steel touched another high rec
ord for this year on account of rumors
of. still further advances in prices of
steel products and the maintenance of
the present prices for steel -rails. The
large dividend declaration on Boston
and Montana, a subsidiary stock, was
the motive for the buying of Amalga
mated Copper. Outside of these quar
ters of the market and of a list of mis
cellaneous specialties, the movement
was Irregular, Western grain carriers
specially showing a lagging tendency.
INCREASE IN SURPLUS.
The bank statement. carried over av
erages from last week's gold shipments
to Cuba, so that the cash decrease ex
ceeded the estimates, but the $11,000,
000 loan contraction modified the ef
fects so as to leave a nominal increase
in the surplus i*eserve. In view of the
week's large operations, involving
heavy capital outlay, it is evident that
the trust companies' activity- in the
money market is taking over large ac
counts from the banks.
-. Total sales of bonds, $3,040,000.
The conspicuous points of strength
ln this week's stock market have been
sufficient to give tone to the whole
market and have sustained those se
curities in which realizing was in prog
ress, so that such declines as they have
suffered have been limited to small fig
ures. The volume of business has aver
aged nearly 1,500,000 -shares a day,
shov/inp the sustained speculative in
terest in the market.
Records of the November trans
actions at the Stock Exchange show
a total of nearly 32,000,000 shares of
stocks which changed hands during
the month, which Is more by one
third than for. any, previous Novem
ber in the history of the Stock Ex
.change.r; The sales :of bonds also
.tl'tnouh'tect to $218,853,500, made up in
large -part of Issue's, selling below par
andT of; a "more or. .less speculative
character : by reason of convertible
privileges/ contingent interest claims
or, , deoehdence ~ oh -earnings of col
lateral stocks of the same companies.
The. force of the tide of the market
is sufficiently shown "by these figures.
GENERAL OUTLOOK. ".
The cheerful view of the general
outlook for Improvement in business,
the prospect for prosperous harvests
and the expanding demand for nearly
all classes of merchandise form the
broad, underlying basis of the mar
ket, as from the outset of the move
ment, and these influences have been
supplemented by reports, more or less
vague, of departments applying more
especially to individual properties.
The supplies of the money market
also have proved, ample up to this
time to "care for the needs of the large
speculation and " the growing volume
of /new capital issues offering for
absorption. These include an install
ment on the Cuban loan floated, in
this country, the final Installment on
the new Southern Pacific preferred
stock, besides various railroad stock
and bond issues, the sale of which ha3
been announced during the week.
Unconfirmed reports that were an
influence In the week's stock market
dealt with/ the " supposed Northern
Securities settlement, the acquisition
of the 'Lehish Coal and Navigation
Company for consolidating the an
thracite situation, the conversion into
sinking fund bonds of the remaining
$50,000,000 of United States Steel pre
ferred available for that purpose and
plans for the absorption by larger sys
tems of various minor railroads. /
The bond market has been active
and . somewhat irregular. United
States new fours coupons have ad
vanced'^ on call during the week.
Owing to the exceptional rains the
last season the Colorado peach -crop is
larger ' than â  ever. The Ashenfelter

Handwriting Expert Gives
Startling Evidence in Den
ver Election' Fraud Cases
bfi'OOKED WORK SHOWX
Witness Says Two Different
Kinds of Ink Were Used on
'the Votes in One Ward
DENVER, Colo., Dec. 3. â Startling
developments were made in the Su
preme Court in the trial of the six
election officials of Ward 6. Precinct 9,
who 'are charged with contempt.
George H. King, handwriting expert,
said that fifty-seven of the ballots In
the box had been written by ten dif
ferent persons. The highest number
written by one person was nineteen.
The lowest was two. Five Republi
can ballots were written by one per
son. The other fifty-two ballots on
which the expert noted similarity of
handwriting were Democratic.
/: ."It is evident that two kinds of Ink
were used in the writing of the bal- \
lots," said King. "Whether this was
occasioned by two different kinds be
ing furnished by the Election Com
mission or whether certain ballots
were written outside the booths, of
course, I am unable to say." *r
It la the general belief among the
attorneys who have followed the con
tempt proceedings closely that the re
sult of the discoveries made by the
court will be to 1 bring the ballot box
of every precinct where contempt is
charged into court for examination.
There are six more precincts in which
election officials are awaiting trial for
contempt.
RUSHING WORK
ON EXPOSITION
Several Large Structures
for the Lewis and Clark
Fair Are Nearly Finished
PORTLAND, Or.. Dec. 3. â Next
week will see the completion of the
principal exhibit buildings at the Lew
is and Clark Exposition. With the
foreign exhibits buildings already fin
ished and the administration group
practically done the contractors have
placed large forces of men at work.
The exposition management is equally
anxious to have the buildings com
pleted, as it is a matter of but a few
days now before the exhibits will
begin to arrive from . St. Louis â¢ for
storage. The work that remains to be
done on six of the exhibit buildings is
interior finishings. The group of
buildings commenced last spring are
nearly completed.
The buildings that are so nearly
ready for occupation include the Ag
ricultural Palace, the Liberal Arts
building,, the Fire Department build
ing, the Public Comfort building, the
Public Shelter building and Adminis
tration building. Work is also being
rushed on the Festival Hall, the Ma
chinery, Electricity and Transporta
tion Palace and the Oregon State
building. In the near future another
force of men will be at work on the
new 60.000-foot exhibit building,
which the exposition management de
cided during the last week to build.
Much work' Is being done on the Gov
ernment building on the Peninsula in
Guild's Lake, and there is every rea
son to believe the Government's group
will be ready at least thirty days be
fore the opening of the exposition.

said:
"During my trip on the 'IiombarfUa* I
sent several Important wireless telegrams

Atlantic and promptly received replies to
them. Every morning I read the worlds
news which was furnished the passen-
gers ln English, French and Italian. I
am satisfied from my personal experienc*
that the Marconi System Is a success. Itt
is invaluable to business men as it en-
ables them to kÂ»>ep in touch with their
office and family and keeps them posted
on the most Important events in all parts
of the world. It also gives passengers a
feeling of safety ln case of danger or ac-
cident as it enables the steamer tÂ» call
for help in case of need."
SEATTLE. Nov. 26.â Wireless station*
in the Puget Sound are to ba promptly,
erected to help catch the smugglers of
Chinese and opium from th* Canadian
line.
Engineers of the Marconi Company
have madÂ« a careful survey of thÂ» Pa-
cific Coast and have found its posslbllttea
â o promising, not only for commanlca-tlon
from ship to shore, but to and from tha
Hawaiian and Philippine Lilanda. that
installations at various points will follow
at the earliest possible moment. Seven
Marconi stations are already in operation
ln the Hawaiian Islands.
PARIS. Dec. 3.â The French savant, M.
Bernard, is convinced that Nansen toolc
the only feasible route to the North Polo.
He- favors an expedition with two ships
connected by wireless telegraphy. It is
expected that the Prince of Monaco, who.
is greatly interested ln the project, will
contribute the necessary $300,000.
The foregoing telegrams have recently
appeared in tha newspapers of the
country.
Mr. Marconi, the inventor of wireless
telegraphy, has announced - that he will
return to the United States ln a few days
and hopes to be ready on January 1 to
open to the public for commercial busi-
ness the new trans-Atlantic station or
Cape Breton, which will communicate
with the Poldhu trans-Atlantic station, a
distance of 3500 miles. This great event
in the world's history will be followed by
the opening of another trans-Atlantic sta-
tion now nearing completion near Boston.
But few, even among the. best posted,
have even a faint' idea of what already
has been accomplished^ by the Marconi
axstem. It has already been' the means
of saving hundreds of lives and millions
of dollars of valuable property. The Mar-
coni system' is now ln daily operation on
nearly 200 steamers of the Merchant Ma-
rine and men-of-war of several nations.
The Marconi system is now operating
in the service daily newspapers, published
in raid-ocean, on board trans- Atlantic
steamships. This service will eventually
supply news dispatches to hundreds, if
not thousands, of vessels every day. It
ls'estlmated that this branch of the Mar-
coni business will bring the company a
net annual profit of over $700,000.
The receipts of the Marconi Company
during 1303 show the gratifying increase
of more than 700 per cent over those of
1902. and the year 1904 will show a much
greater increase.
The earnings of one department of this
company (the Trans-Atlantic), -when in
full operation, will alone be sufficient to
pay an annual dividend of 15) per cent
on the present capitalization.
The Trans-Pacific Marconi service,
when fully equipped and in operation, is
capable of earning $976,000. net, per an-
num.
The Marconi system is now entering
the stage where it is becoming a serious
competitor of the cables. The cost of Its
installation, of maintenance and of opera-
tion id so small compared with that of
the cable and wire systems that It can
afford to transmit messages for LESS
THAN HAL.F the price of th* old sys-
tems, therefore it stands to reason that
the public always gives the preference
to the cheaper rate.
Electrical inventions offer the greatest
opportunities of our age. Large fortunes
have been made by those who Invested in
Edison Electric Light and in Bell Tele-
phone. The shares of the Edison com-
pany Increased from $100 to $4000 In one
year. The profits of an original Invest-
ment of $100 in Bell Telephone are to-day
more than $200,000. Marconi securities,
taken NOW, offer as great an oppor-
tunity.
There is no doubt that if of
Marconi securities will hold them for four
or live years he will be able to sell them
for ten or twenty times . the amount hÂ«Â»
paid for them, and that he will in a few
years more find the Investment ad profit-
able to him as the Bell Telephone stocks
have been to others.
Marconi securities have already In-
creased 100 per cent"' during the past
twelve months, a greater increase in
value than any other security on the
market in the same time, and immediate-
ly following the opening of the, above-
menticned trans-Atlantic stations 'there la
no doubt that Marconi securities will bo
worth from TWO to THREE TIMES or
more the present price. In view of the
above facts you should loÂ»e no time in
securing all you can afford to take.
As a consequence of the increased a3-
sets and revenues. resulting from the re-
cent opening of several new and Impor-
tant stations the price of Marconi certi-
ficates will be further advanced any day
from $6 to $7 WITHOUT FURTHEK
WARNINO.

BIG PENSIONS
OF ENGLISHMEN
Immense Sums Paid by the
British Government to Re
tired Members of Cabinet
Special Dlepetch to The Call,
LONDON. Dec. 3.â When a Cabinet
official in America returns to private
life he is expected, as a matter of
course, to take upon himself the burden
of providing his own living, but here,
if he apply for it, he may obtain a
handsome pension. Radicals are ob
jecting since the discovery that Lord
Cross, who is now SI years old, has in
this tray drawn $113,500 from the pub
lic treasury, his pension amounting to
510,000 a year. During his two terms
of c-ffice as Home Secretary, extending
over mere than six and a half years,
he drew a salary of $25,000 a year,
which is over thrice as much as any
American Cabinet Minister is paid.
Altogether Lord Cross has received i
from his country J2S0.000, and it is the I
general opinion that it is a great deal j
more than he has been worth to it. j
Lord George Hamilton draws a simi- j
lar pension of J10.000 a year and Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach gets one of $d000.
The popular notior- that municipal
politicians in this country are of a
much higher type than those who run
American cities has been rudely shak- j

cost of various Junketing trips under

Fireman at Sanitarium Perishes In

ST. LOUIS, Dec 8.â One man was
burned to death and four young women
nurses were injured by Jumping from
windows and in running through the

The Weber Piano Representation.
For_ some time past there have been ru
mors "of a proposed change in the repre
sentation of the Weber Piano Company
in this territory and musical circles on
the coast have been considerably agitat
ed thereby. This company recently
united its interests with that of the
Aeolian Company of New York, forming
a heavily capitalized corporation, known
as the Aeolian- Weber Piano and Pianola
Company. It is the largest manufac
turer and dealer in musical instruments
in the world.
Very keen competition has developed
among the leading musical houses on the
coast to secure this important agency.
The rumors current are decidedly con
flicting and no confirmation or absolute
denial is vouchsafed by any of the local
music dealers, but it is pretty sure that
the big New York concern will be satis
fied only by a representation commensu
rate with its importance, and therefore
by the strongest and largest dealer on
the coast.
A representative of the New York cor
poration recently arrived in San Fran
cisco, and it is believed that ' an an
nouncement of the house that has se
cured^ the prize will be soon forthcoming'.
amounted to $350. According to the
itemized account they fortified them
eelves for their arduous labors with m
less than sixty-three bottles of Scotch
whisky, besides a dozen bottles of cham
pagne and some odd bottles of claret,
sherry and 4iock. It would be a diffi
cult matter to find any twenty Ameri
can Aldermen who eould beat that rec
ord and then have the effrontery to
cha^e It to the public account.

ENGLISHMAN'S
PALATIAL HOME
Briton Undertakes Work of
Eemodeling Country Seat
, aVan Expense of $1,500,000
LONDON, Dec. 3.â So much are they
overshadowed by the American brand
that something of surprise follows the
occasional reminder that England still
produces multi-millionaires of her own.
Charles Julius "Wernher has recently
called attention to his vast wealth by
the costly work he has undertaken at
Luton Hoo, the fine country seat which
he purchased from the executors of the
late Madame de Falbe for 51,500,000.
It is a magnificent, place, but as much
more is to be expended on it to render
It a fitting residence for the senior
member of the great South African
firm of Wernher, Beit & Co. *
Three hundred men are engaged in
carrying out the alterations and addi
tions he has planned. Among them are
some scores of Italian stoneworkers
and French and Belgian plasterers, for
"Wernher will employ only the bes^ ar
tisans in their respective lines. The
huge house is being enlarged by one
story, but the massive stone walls and
the superb Corinthian pillars at the
main entrance are to remain. The in
terior is to be entirely remodeled with
the exception of the chapel in the west
wing, which is to be spared on account
of its rich oak carvings.
The park itself is being greatly
changed in accordance with the de
signs of a distinguished landscape ar
tist. One of the lakes, d mile' and a
quarter long, has been drained, which
has given rise to the rumor that, emu
lating the late "Whlttaker Wright, of
tragic memory, Wernher intends to
provide a cool retreat for himself in
hot weather In the form of a subter
ranean palace.
Private golf links are being laid out
wealth it has already been dubbed the
plentifully stocking the place with
game. One part of the estate is to be
set aside for zebras, elands and other
habitats of the African wilds. In rec
ognition of the source of Wernher's
wealth it has already been dubbed the
"diamond palace." When completed
it will be fit for a King, and probably
the King will be entertained there.
HOBBIES OF THE ROYAIi
PERSONAGES OF EUROPE
Princess of Wales Records Sayings of
Her Children â Kaiser Keeps His
Press Notices.
LONDON. Dec. 3. â Little that roy
alty does nowadays escapes observa
tion and the more that is learned of
them the more it is made apparent
that these great folk are very like or
dinary folk. That is shown by their
hobbies, to which attention has Just
been called by the announcement that
the King of Italy's zeal for collecting
coins had led to his joining the Nu
mismatic Society.
Most characteristic of all royal hob
bles, perhaps, is that of the Kaiser,
who, in handsomely "bound volumes,
preserves the clippings sent by his
agents in various parts of the world of
things that" have appeared In print
about him. If their number affords
any true index of fame then the Kai
ser-has some reason to consider him
self the greatest man In i the , world.
The Crown Prince's hobby is a rather
commonplace one, sinca it is shared
by millions. He has fallen a victim to
the picture postcard craze. -
Touchingly pretty and feminine, If
by no means original, is the bobby of
the Princess -of Wales. In* a dainty
vellum bound. volume she records the
first words spoken by her children and
their quaintest sayings as they" grow
up. The .Queen, who, it Is well known.
Is a skillful amateur photographer,
collects photographs taken by herself
of scenes and places she has visited.
It constitutes a veritable pictorial au
tobiography.
The Prince of "Wales contracted the
stamp collecting: mania when he was
a small boy and still sticks to it. "With
such exceptional opportunities as he,
enjoys it is needless to say by this
time his collection of stamps is a su
perb one. Of more artistic interest is
his collection of posters, miniature
and full size. h
The German Empress goes v in foi
fans and possesses a quaint ani gor
geous collection of them. It includes
a fan made f^rom the -feathers of a
grouse shot by' the Kaiser.
The Prettiest Yet
Are the shapes and finish of our new
frames. Exquisite designs in" oval,
square and odd shapes, finished In dead
black, grays and browns, with the dain

placed a necktie around her neck

HELENA, Mont., Dec. 3.â Mystery
surrounds the reported death of Misj
Kate Pendergast of Minneapolis and
the subsequent disappearance of her
brother, Edward Pendergast.
Edward Pendergast informed the
press here of the death of his sister,
which is supposed to have occurred on
Tuesday. He then engaged an under
taker and hired * carriages for the
funeral, to be held on Friday. He de
parted for Broadwater, as he said, to
attend to some private business pend
ing the arrival of relatives from Min
neapolis. At the appointed time the
hearse and carriages arrived, at the
place indicated, but no dead girl could
be found at any of the undertaking
rooms, nor did the' authorities at the
hospftal where she is supposed to have
died know anything about her death.
Pendergast has not returned.

Infant Is in Best or Health and at

Pounds.
SOMERVILLE, Mass.. Dec. 3.â A fe
male child with two heads, born in
East Somerville, twelve weeks ago. Is
attracting much interest among the
medical fraternity about Boston. The
physician who had charge of the case,
in discussing the matter with other
doctors, said:
"It 1e unprecedented In the annals of
medical science. The child has two sep
t-rate necks, each supporting a head,
one facing to the front and the other
to the rear. The latter head is not well
formed. Its features are irregular and
imperfect, there being no eyes.
"The baby is in the best of health
and perfectly normal in every other
respect. The mother is 20 years of age.
The child weighed fourteen pounds at
birth."

A CORPORATION
German Capital Intends

Five Suburban Eailways
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, Dec. 3. â Berlin has been
suddenly plunged into a fight which
promises a long and bitter struggle
between the municipality and the
powerful Grosse Berliner Street Rail
way Company, now in possession of
Btreets under a twenty-year franchise
expiring in 1919. The conflict was
precipitated by the determination of
the city to build five suburban lines
to compete with the best lines of the
Etreet railway corporation. The di
rectors of the Grosse Berliner Com
pany believe its arrangement with the
city prohibits municipal competition

during the life of the franchise. They
have called a special meeting for next
Wednesday to discuss legal steps to
obstruct the city's plans.
This .situation is aggravated by the
city's intention to construct 'a tunnel
under the famous avenue Unter den
Linden for the purpose of connecting
two municipal lines, and also of com
pelling the Grosse Berliner Company
to use tunnels for Its two tracks, which
now cross the surface of Unter den
Linden. The city's project has the
warm support of the Kaiser, and the
contest is certain to be a battle royal.
The Grosse Berliner Company com
mands resources amounting to 125,000,
000 marks ($25,250,000) while the city
can secure unlimited financial backing
at low rates of interest for carrying
out its municipal ownership schemes.
The recent action of the Grosse Berliner
Company in raising its commutation
rates 25 per cent is one reason why the
city authorities are so incensed.
The two existing city lines barely^pay
operating expenses, owing to the lack
of a connecting link, as well as on ac
count of the superior service of the
street railway corporation in same dis
tricts. ::*â¢ â¢;:

WOLGAMOT
CONFESSES
HIS GUILT
One of the Accused in the
Oregon Land Fraud Cases
Causes a Sensation by
Entering a Plea of Guilty
JUDGE TO CHARGE -
JUKY ON MONDAY
Special Prosecutor Requests
Court to Dismiss Marie
Ware, as Evidence Against
Her Is Not Conclusive
PORTLAND, Dec. 3.â Prolific in sur
prises and sensations as have been the
development's in the land fraud cases,
none was prepared for the climaxes of
to-day. By far the most important,
both because of its unexpectedness and
because of the moral effect 4t is almost
certain to have on the jury, was the re
quest of Defendant Frank H. Wolga
mot, through his attorney, for leave to
withdraw his plea of "not guilty" and
be allowed to plead guilty to the crime
of conspiracy as charged. Judge Bel
linger took the matter under advise
ment. v/-: ; ;â '>â â '; 'â ''.
Almost equally unexpected was the
request on the part of the special pros
ecutor, Francis J. Heney, that an order
of acquittal be made in the case of
Marie L. Ware, on the ground that the
prosecution did not' believe that she,
according to the evidence, had been
proven guilty of aiding the present con
spiracy.
Of hardly less surprise was the an
nouncement made by the defense not
more than twenty minutes after the
Government had completed Its case,
that It rested and that the case was
ready for argument by counsel.
WOLGAMOT 'PLEADS GUILTY.
It was when court convened in the
afternoon that the second great sur
prise of the day occurred. The flrsi
was sprung at the morning session,
when the defense rested and brought
the trial to so sudden a close.
Claude Strahan, a new attorney in
the case, arose and stated: "I appear
for Frank H. Wolgamot, and wish to
withdraw his plea of not guilty and
substitute that of guilty."
"Mr. Wolgamot," asked the court, "do
you so desire?"
"I do," he said.
"What is your plea?" asked the court.
"Guilty."
Attorney Jieney then caused the last
sensation of the day.
"Your Honor," he said, "I have long
followed the rule in prosecuting cases
to not ask a Jury . to return a verdict
In a case where I could not myself go
into the juryrroom and vote for con
viction. In this case I do not think that
the Government has proven beyond a
reasonable doubt that Marie Ware is
connected with this particular conspir
acy within the life of the statute of
limitations. There is no doubt in my
mind that she forgÂ«d the name of
Mattie S. Lowell, but there is no evi
dence to show that she did it with the}
purpose of furthering this particular'
conspiracy. I would therefore ask that
an order of acquittal be made by the
court in her case."
MAKES STRONG ARGUMENT.
Judge Bellinger stated that such
would be the action at the proper time,
and that the confession of Wolgamot
would also be ordered to not be taken
by the jury as going to the prejudice of
the other defendants in the case.
Attorney Hall then made his state
ment to the jury. It was a simple
recitatlo.n of the evidence as given from
the commencement of the conspiracy,
when Emma Porter first filed her ap
plication, until the last patent was is
sued and the lands transmuted into
money. The argument was strong,
clear and concise.
When Hall concluded court adjourned
until Monday, when Judge O'Day will
present the argument for the defense,
after which Attorney Heney will speak
for the prosecution. It is thought that
the case will go to the jury on Monday.
Lots of people chew the rag be
cause they can't do as they choose.

FOR TWENTY YEARS.
Not an Unusual Instance.
"I used Pyramid Pile Cure and have
not had any trouble since. I have been
a sufferer with piles for twenty years.
I think it' is the best remedy on earth
tor- piles. Hoping, this may help
others to use this remedy." Mrs. J.
D. Teller, R. F. D. 20, Sparta, Mich*.
It is a singular fact that although
many women suffer from piles, or
hemorrhoids, they frequently do not
have proper treatment because of a
delicacy women have In mentioning
such a subject. Especially is this the
case with those who have no hus-
band or brother " In whom they can
confide; and a physician Is seldom
consulted until the pain and agony in-
cident to piles become unbearable.
Thousands of .women have suffered
even longer than did- Mrs. Teller, al-
ways experiencing slight or temporary
relief, if any, from the various reme-
dies used and finally settling down to
the conviction that a cure in their
cases was impossible: Pyramid Pile
Cure has come as a boon to all such,
as it seldom," If ever, fails to effect a
permanent cure. It is sold by drug-
gists for 50 cents a. package, or will

WOMEN DESIRE
TO SEE WEBER
Call at the Jail tp Tisit
Prisoner but Are Denied
Admittance by Officials
Special Dispatch to The Call,
AUBURX, Dec. 3. â The Grand Jury
adjourned at noon to-day until next
Monday morning without having fin
ished its investigation into the mur
der and robbery charges pending
against Adolph Weber.
Weber's only visitor to-day was for
mer Constable Henry Leak. Several
women applied for admission to visit
Weber, but were refused. Leak is
the man who shot at some one in the
dark out in the hills after the bank
robbery. He heard a movement in
the brush and soon the form of a man
appeared. Leak shouted for him to
"halt," and when the fellow ran Leak
shot, knocking off the fugitive's hat.
The next morning the robber's pistol
was found near the scene of the shoot
ing by Ralph McKinstry, a boy. Leak
could not Identify Weber as the. man
he had shot at.
The prisoner will be called upon
Monday to plead to the charge of
having killed his mother. He will en
ter a plea of not guilty and the case
will be set for trial.
. Searchers are still looking for
Weber's second hiding place, for his
money. There Is $825 missing from
the proceeds of the bank robbery and
it is not believed that Weber spent it.
He Is like his father was â very
thrifty. He does not drink nor smoke
and was not a spendthrift.
E. C. Snowden, husband of Mrs.
Snowden, Weber's aunt, was out to
day for the first time since the
tragedy. Snowden is an old man and
has been greatly upset by the mur
ders.

Uricsol,
the only cvre for
Rheumatism.
If you ere suffering from rheuma-Â«
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will day aside your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
UrLsol cures rheumatism in the onl^
possible way it can be cured.
â¢ Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joint*
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-Â»
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates tha
kidneys, liver ..nd bowel:, and thus
drives them from the system.
Uricsol is harmless, and no injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any
part of your body.

GRAPE-NTTS.
THE "IX\-EXTIpN."
firandma Found It Con\-en!ent.
It is remarkable what a change can
be made in a family by a simple rear-
rangement of food.
A Chicago mother says: "Much to
my surprise yesterday morning: I found
the enclosed letter on my desk, written
by my seven-year-old daughter with-
out any suggestion from a soul, and
the little letter induced me to write
something' of our experiences.
"First my son who was very small
and weak was sent out to visit one of
my sisters, and she induced him to
start in on Grape-Nuts and cream in
place of the ordinary food used.
"When the boy came back after an
absence of about six months we could
hardly believe our eyes,- He had grown
over three inches in height, and waÂ»
an entirely different fellow In every
way, always ready, for any athletic
sport proposed and on the keen go all
of the time, while before he only want-
ed to sit or lie down, and suffered
greatly from headaches and general
prostration.
â¢ "So we put our little girl on Grape-
Nuts and she grew well and healthy
and rosy in a short time.
"Then Mother, who is 82 years old,
began u*ing Grape-Nuts and would
frequently put the food into soup or
with an egg Into a bowl and pour broth
over It.
"She had formerly been troubled with
her stomach, suffering great pain at
times; now she says the 'invention'
has cured her and she uses Grape-Nuts
In a variety of waysâ puddings, dress-
tnf for chickens or turkeys, griddle
c*ie6 and all sorts of nice things.
"The boy has been using Grape-Nuts
now for about two years and has
Brown something over 7 inches and
sained about 35 pounds, and Is still im-
proving'." â 
The little girl's letter is too lone to
reproduce, but it is written in a very
cunning style and tells her own story
.xif how she got over being sick and Was
able to so to school again, making four
in a short time, and how 'well
and healthy she felt and how much
â¢she loved the GrarÂ»e-Nuts.
"She heard her'Mother tell her'Auntle
that "Grape-Nu'iB was a God-send." so
she thought God made Virape-Nuts
until she got hold <jf thellittle recipe
book one day. which she found In the
package, and thf folks explained to
hT that it was made" by xome men in

CHOOSE THIRD
MAN ON BOAKD
Julius Ho wells Is to Act
With City Engineer F. C.
Turner and A. M. Hunt
For the third member of the board
of engineers to examine into the prop
osition of the Bay Cities Water Com
pany to furnish Oakland with a water
supply, Julius M. Howells of San
Francisco, an engineer of wide expe
rience, was selected this afternoon by
City Engineer F. C. Turner, acting for
the city of Oakland, and A. M. Hunt,
the representative of the Bay Cities
Company. These three will pass upon
the proposition of the practicability
of the plan for the city to buy its own
water works. -
The proposal of the Bay Cities
Companies to sell the city a water
supply of its own embraced a proposi
tion to have a board of three engin
eers pass upon the proposed scheme.
The City Council appointed City En
gineer Turner as its representative.
The Bay Cities chose A. M. Hunt, and
these two together chose the third
member, who was announced this af
ternoon. Many names were consid
ered and many prominent men were
found disqualified because of their
having had business relations at some
time or another with the various wa
ter companies in this neighborhood.
Mr. Howells comes originally from
Bowling Green, Ohio. Here he en
gaged in work on the draining of the
Black Swamp. Later he was assist
ant engineer and engineer of the city
of Richmond, Ind. He afterward took
employment with several different
railroads and in 1883 came to Califor
nia for Professor Agassiz of Harvard
In the study the tertiary history of
the Sierra >?bvadas. He .went back to
Chicago and established. himself as a
hydraulic engineer and was engaged
in the construction of water works at
Mount Vernon; -Y.; Jersey . i City,
Ashtabula, Topeka, Marysville, Win
nipeg, Santa Fe and many other cities.
Besides this he has! experted many
propositions for capitalists and bond
buyers.

Pislierman'6 Narrow Escape.
Saro Matteo, a fisherman, narrow

aroused after heroic measures had
been adopted at the Harbor Hospital.

LXrVXT EARL RICHEST

LONDON, Dec. 3. â After a lapse of
twenty years, the title of Earl of Gros

Westminster's family. The Infant Earl
of Grosvenor is heir to the richest es
ts.le in land held by any one In this
country.
The Westminster estate is not large
in acreage. The Duke of Sutherland's
estate is a hundredfold that of the
Duke of Westminster, but more than a
hundredfold less productive. The ducal
acres in Westminster bring In annually

the contractors could not obtain pay

GREAT ACTIVITY IN
THE MINES.
Annual Convention to Open
In This City Next Monday
Live Topics to Be Discussed
Great expectations are entertained
concerning the proceedings of the
California Miners' Association at the
annual convention that will be opened
to-morrow, at the Hotel St. Fran
cis. The programme has already been
published in The Call. Technical pa
pers will take the attention of the del
egates to some extent, but there are
topics of concern to the entire State
on the list to be considered.
Of leading importance will probably
be the subject treated by E. A. Belcher,
namely, "The Mineral Land Laws of
the United States." At all times the
laws relating to mines are a lively
topic. The matter of next importance
possibly may be gold dredgln*. which
will be treated by I* J. HohL This
has been discussed actively during the
year, as readers of mining news and all
miners are aware. Charles G. Yale,
statistician for the United States Mint
in this city and also for the California
State Mining Bureau, will talk about
mineral statistics. The subject is full
of pith.
Some ground for discussion may be
found in a recent report made by Wag
goner, State Debris Commissioner. A
few of his statements have already
given rise to comment. Waggoner says
that "as the mines have shut down,
the records show that the hiKh water
mark at Marysville has been getting
higher, nearly every succeeding winter
breaking the records of preceding
years. The Yuba is scouring a channel
through the tailings and dumping into
the Feather River, -ind It will not be
many years befc:Â« that channel will
be filled."
In another place Waggoner says that
"the result of debris legislation has
been that the miners have lost and It
will be only a comparatively few years
when It will be the valley's turn." Some
paragraphs attributed to Waggoner, in
an interview that is going through
the papers in the interior, are as fol
lows:
LOSING THE YUBA RIVER.
Years ago I undertook the debris problem,
with a view to satisfy the decisions of the
courts and so that the mines could be oper
ated and the valley could have full protection,
and soon developed a plan that Is now known
as "Losing the Yuba," by which mines could
operate as long as there was any gravel to
mine. During the last year this plan has
gained a firm foothold among the thinking
people of Marysville and in Butter County, be
cause what la causing all the trouble is the
great dumps on the plains of the mining
streams, the greatest being the Yuba River. In
that the greatest amount of placer gold has
been extracted on its watershed.
The problem resolves itself Into two things â
either the deposit is to be washed into the
navigable rivers or kept out. To keep debris
out means the resumption of hydraulic mining.
Xo better argument is needed than the de
cision of Judge Davis of Sutter County In the
suit against the Polar Star mine â wherein he
held that the permits of the California Debris
Commission are not final, the courts having
a perfect right to determine whether or not a
hydrauUc mine be operated with or without
Injury to the " rivercJAfd that 'the function
of the commission is to permit .only such min
ing as will not. directly or indirectly. Injure
the navigable streams. â¢" * B -
During my visit to Marysvllle I talked with
several members of the -Tuba and Sutter
County Improvement Association and proposed
that they call a convention of the citizens of
the mountain and valley counties, to be held
in Marysville. say the middle of next month,
and settle all their differences by working out
a plan for their mutual benefit. The" associa
tion has taken the proposition under advise
ment. Alk the farmers and miners have to do
Is to unload their troubles where they be
long â upon the lawyers and engineers of twen
ty-five years ago â and make a united effort to
"lose the Tuba," which will give both sec
tions all they ever really wantedâ the valley,
relief and protection; the miners, the privilege*
of operating their mines.
The Amador Ledger says that the
mill at the Fremont mine is running at
full capacity. Preparations are un
der wav to start the Red Mill mine, In
the Aetna district, on a large scale. A
Stockton company has t secured the
property. The Whitmore mine, near
Volcano, Is operating on a small scale.
The ore at the Bunker Hill is reported
to look well. A large outlay will be
made for improvements in the ma
chinery- The dropping of 100 stamps
at the Kennedy mill will make It nec
essary to Increase the working force.
MINES OF SISKIYOU.
Some account of recent operations in
Siskiyou County is given by the Sac
ramento Bee, which says in part:
Siskiyou County mines are snowing up well
this season. At the King Solomon a- force of
men Is engaged in running a crosscut from the
700-foot tunnel to tap the ore that has been en
countered at the bottom of the shaft. It Is In
tended to erect a large milling plant In order
that the mine may be worked on an extensive
scale. The Mount Shasta and Slghtman placer
claims have been bonded . to capitalists from
Portland. Or., and it is reported that they will
install a large modern hydraulic plant, run
ning a ditch about four miles long, and work
the properties on an extensive scale. ' The Sal
mon River Mining Company, having about 600
acres of placer ground, is now running full.
The Gold Dyke Mining Company has finished
the erection of Its building and the machinery
Is now being taken In by pack trains. It con
sists of two three-stamp mills, and It Is
thought everything will be In * readiness for
operation by January.. The Cariboo. Mining
Company has closed down ' for the winter
months, but will start up again In the spring,
and will then erect a milling plant which will
ba run by electricity. Two veins of ore have
been encountered : and the property is very
promising. The mill < at the Wild , ' Irishman
group has been completed and Is running on
ore said to run about $60 per ton.
Progress is reported at . San An
dreas. The Citizen says in part:
If knockers will put up their hammers for a
season and give their Jaws a rest it will not
be. long before' San Andreas will" become &
good mining town and all business will flour
ish and every resident will, profit- directly or
Indirectly thereby. A year ago nothing was
doing In gravel; to-day a half dozen or more
gravel mines are In operation, - some producing
and others . developing and will produce In a
short time. Another company has been formed
and will open -up and operate the O'Connell
property In the channel near the Anderson.
The Stanislaus -Power and Milling Compay Is
putting in a line to Copperopolls, some miles
beyond Knights Ferry, and In Calaveras Coun
ty, to- supply from 800 to 400 horsepower to a
company opening the old copper -mine there
on a large scale. The process of unwaterlng
the mine and preparing it for the operations
planned has extended over a period of three or
four years the, copper precipitated from the
water yielding an Income. that is. said. to have
met the cost of the operations. The water Is
run through boxes, over scrap -tin and: Iron,
which â  serves to precipitate the copper carried
In the solution; It ' is expected that the . com
pany will employ from 200 to 800 men.' De
velopment work is steadily progressing on the
property of the San Andreas Blue Gravel Com
pany. The mill at the Chris Anderson has been
operating on half time the â  past 'week.- The
different tracks are being laid and other, neces
sary work above . ground ; Is â¢ being done, and
when completed" the mill' will work- day and
night. D. P. . Gray â¢ has > purchased the Glnoc
chlo mine at Lower Calaveritas. He will goon
begin â¢ development â  work. Gray has also se
cured the Hagerman mine, near town, and has
a force of men at work there.
SUTTER CREEK WORKINGS.
â  The Sutter Creek Record reports con
cerning mining operations in the vi
cinity- of Sutter: Greek as follows in
substance: .
At the Defender . mine, near Volcano a
three-foot ledge has = been opened up In "the
new shaft.' -The Lone - Star. . in the same dis
trict, la making a good â  showing. At the Ar
gonaut "mine development .work continues,
while recently - preparations have - been made
for starting . the mill. -.- It .; Is - understood ' that
the mill will start within five or kIx weeks.
About one mile above Oleta." atÂ° American Flat
one Mr. Dietz-is eald to be- making;prepara
tions for the opening up of. a quartz mine for
Son ' Francisco people." Supplies are in transit
to the ; place. Another - body of ; ore has - been
encountered at . the - Bay -â â¢ State ml nr near
Plymouth. On the 1030 levrl - an eight-foot
ledsre of ore has been encountered. On this
level the ledge is opened up SCO feet. The
people of Oleta have been much encouraged
of. late. The opening of the Elliot -mine is
livening: thingrs up. Mr. Thornton has ac
cepted the superintendency of another mine
not, far from the Elliot, which Is being de
veloped by San Francisco capital. Three shifts,
comprising twelve ' men. ' continue at the Bur
lington shaft and progress is good. The
hole Is now 1C0 feet in depth' and much water
has been encountered. A crosscut was run
for forty-one feet at the 100- foot level and at
160 feet In depth a ledge has been struck
which Is six feet In width and shows good
values. At this point a drift Is now being run
and a station cut for the handling of the
water. s. *â¢ â â¢â¢
There Is considerable interest In re
cent operations In Placer County
which are summed up by the Placer
Herald as follows:
A. P. Orasser of the Three Stan mine Is
superintending the placing of a lot of new ma
chinery In the Smith Point mine, near the
Znntgraf, preparatory to the reopening of the
mine. - A number of persons, recognizing the
possibilities of the land adjoining the Dairy
Farm mine. In the Lincoln district, have
bonded 1C0 acres of the Haley tract and begun
development work. A company of San Fran
cisco men have secured the Dormody ranch of
200 acres near Green Valley, above Folsom,
and will mine It by dredging process. The
Elite mine at Shady Run struck gravel in an
upraise of thirty-five feÂ«t last week after run
ning a tunnel of 1800 feet. The owners hare a
larire quantity of ground.*
ACTIVE AT ALLJEGHANY.
The Grass Valley Union reports ac
tlvivlty in the vicinity of 'Alle&hany
and American Hill, about ten miles
above Forest City. It says:
The prospects are that next spring and sum
mer the mining outlook there will be evÂ«n bet
ter than at present, and more development will
be under way than for many years past. ' At
the Alleghany mine nearly everything is in
readiness for winter, most of the buildings
being completed, while the -winter supplies are
in, and with a couple of weeks more of favor
able weather the company will be prepared to
run until spring uninterruptedly. The tunnel
is in 750 feet, and In a few weeks an upraise
will be made to reach the gravel channel
above, as it is believed that the tunnel la
plenty low enough to be under the bedrock.
W. W. Miller of Berkeley recently purchased
the Johnston gravel claims in the vicinity of
American Hill and will proceed to develop
them. The Buck brothers of Orleans Flat have
a quartz ledge below Snow Point which con
tinues to produce ore. The Plumbago mine
Is running fifteen stamps. The recent striking
of a thirteen-foot ledge at the Oriental mine
has encouraged the owners. At the Tightner
mine rich ore is being taken out.

the formidable stream of traffic along
the Champs Elysees from the Place de

Almost without interlude throughout
the day some crossings in the avenue
are particularly dangerous. In order to
remedy this a project now is formed to
build a subway at all the most im

STAKVED TO DEATH.
.Our text to-day is the story of the
Kaiser nrho taught his ass to live on
maw. of which he gave him a smaller
portion every day.
just as the miser had got him so
t:;iiiicd as to eat one straw a day â the
pour ass died. 7; V*; v
Ho is an ass u no starves himself to
dc-^thâ as thousands are doing, misled
by foolish teachers â becau.se their
stomachs have become too weak,
thiough neglect or disease, to do the
work which nature has provided for
iheir stomachs to do. . â  - x
Because the engine iE out of gear,
would jou consign it to the Junk heap?
Why, r.i/'. Mend it! ' ."
Commit slow suicide because your di-
gestive organs leak?
Certainly not! Take Stuart's Dys-
l>ejÂ»sia Tablets.
- One thing is sure as shooting.
You can never get a new stomach.
You must mend it, or it will lead you
a miserable existence. |
The only way to mend it is to take I
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
This has been practically and scien-
tifically demonstrated vy the many '
thousands whom Stuart's Dyspepsia
T.ablets have positively cured, after
every other treatment of medicine, mln-
.eral waters, pills and slow, suicidal
starvation had failed.
These methods i-re all unscientific â
therefore false.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are scien-
tific â therefore true, and successful.
Having cured so many thousands â
many of whom doubtless have suffered
more than you doâ do we claim too
much when we say that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets will surely do good to
you? y
Surely not.
especially when we make It plain
that no promise is made to cure more
than one disease â Dyspepsia.
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets are a
positive cure for Just this one disease.
They are a scientific combination of
ingredients which search out the weak
ppots in all the digestive organs and
them make strong and well.
They have an immediate digestive ac-
tion on undigested food, and thus,
v.hile curing we " organs, they at the
same time help them to do their work.
They thus stand for all that is good
in the medical \ atment of Dyspepsia,
and for nothing that is bad.
They are not a fad but a iacL
They re safe, pleasant, certain and
permanent, and can be taken by the
most delicate invalids without fear of
harmful resuHs.

AUTHOR OF NASAL HEMORRHAGE
MAY NEVER BE PUNISHED.
Who Smote Little Lena Daly's Nose?
POLICE JUDGE FRITZ ADMITS INABILITY
BY JA3IES C. CRAWFORD.
After patiently absorbing several
contradictory narratives anent the
smiting: and resultant bleeding of little
Lena Daly's nose, Police Judge -Fritz
virtually admitted his inability Justly
to decide the case in which Mrs. May
D. England, a statuesque matron, was
accused of effecting the nasal hemor-
rhage. Both little Lena and her
mother averred positively that Mrs.
England did It, but that lady, with
equal positiveness, denied the charge,
and supplemented the denial with an
insinuation that her young daughter
might have tapped Lena's claret while
the two children were engaged ln ac
tive fistic combat.
"Humph!" sniffed Mrs. Daly, a rath
er strut lady. 'It's a wonder she don't
swear that my IÂ«na hit her own nose."
Ignoring the caustic interruption,
Mrs. England informed the court that
she would no more think of slapping
Lena Daly's face than she would seri
ously consider a proposal to slay out
right her own daughter. Not that she
â¢.vas particularly infatuated with the
Daly child, whose tricks and manners
she had often warned her own girl
against emulating, inasmuch as they
were reflective of defective training,
but she had affection for all children,
and was firmly and unalterably op
posed to corporal punishment as a cor
rective measure. When her child and
the Daly child were at play and quar
reled, she merely separated them and
instructed her offspring to avoid fur
ther communication with any one
named Daly. She did not see the crim
son stream alleged by the prosecution
to have been drawn by her from Miss
Daly's nose, and if any such stream
hud ever flowed, she did not start it.
At this juncture a man arose from
amid the spectators in court and hold
ins: aloft r. rjfiy small and apparently
much frightened little girl, said in a
ringing tone: "If any blood was drawn
this is the one that drew it." He was
Mrs. England's husband.
Mrs. Daly would like to know why
she ran with her daughter to a doc
tor's office Just as fast as her limbs

could convey her there. If her child's
nose had not been bleeding, and bleed
ing most copiously, would she have
gone to Buch physical exertion and pe
cuniary expense? She had lived at 97
Casselli avenue Ion's enough to acquire
a neighborhood reputation as to char
acter, and she was willing to have that
reputation ventilated in court. What
her neighbors thought about >ome other
folk residing in that quarter; â she
would mention no names â might also
be ascertained by the Judge.
The Judge did not appear to be
yearning to learn how Mrs. Daly and
Mrs. England Etood comparatively tn
the esteem of their mutual acquaint
ances, for his continuance of the case
was equivalent to its dismissal.
Ah Hlm's hallucination that he
owned Portsmouth square was consid
ered Innocuous until he suddenly con
ceived an idea that the Robert Louis
Stevenson monument was a public
eyesore and Insisted that It be re
moved. Then the genuine guardians
of the park ceased pampering his de
lusion and placed him in prison. They
feared that he might become a van
dal.
The aged Celestial's long and scrnff
gy chin appendage wagged furiousiy
as he protested in Judge Mogan's
court against the forced indignity of
his position. His language was pidgen
with frequent lapses into the pure ver
nacular of his race. Was it not shame
ful, he asked, %o reward his generous
treatment of the community by ar
resting and confining him? Had he
not permitted his property to be used
as a public playground when he might
have derived great pecuniary income
from its occupancy by buildings de
voted to mercantile purposes? Hardly
a day passed, as the honorable court
very well knew, without his having
received at least one offer of much
money for a portion or the whole of
his realty. Of the sincerity of these
proposals there was no question. Only
an hour prior to his incarceration he
had refused $9,000,000 offered by a
Caucasian gentleman, who wore blue
overalls and smoked a pipe as he sat
upon a bench and critically surveyed
the desirable property and declared
his willingness Immediately to write a

Smith's attachment to Mrs. Vera Franz,
at whose house on the 200 block of Post
street he resided, began to wane and he
showed unmistakable symptoms' of de-
Eiring? to break away, the lady seized
his trunk, with intent to prevent his
removal to another dwelling place.
Knowing the receptacle held all his
clothing he did not then wear, she im
agined he would hesitate to place him
self beyond immediate opportunity to
change his outer garments, as he was a
young man of pronounced sartorial fas
tidiousness. To her surprise, however,
the intimidatory measure had no re
straining effect . whatever. It .was
spurned by him Just as he had spurned
her less drastic endeavors to rekindle
his love. Instead of either grieving or
sulking, he went forth ln his everyday
garb and instituted search warrant pro
ceedings for the recovery of his prop
erty. Then she, with adoration trans
formed â  into . the fury of a woman
scorned, . filed a cross-complaint charg
ing him with disturbing the peace of
her domicile by hurling scathing words
at her when he discovered she had
commandeered his trunk. Judge Ca
baniss sustained Mr. Smith's side of the
search warrant contention and contin
ued the peace disturbance case.

ordered his accuser Into custody on the
charge of disturbing the peace. C â 
It was shown that Hall provoked the

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
RIOTERS PUT
ON PROBATION
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
214S Center Street, Dec 3.
Instead of expulsion from the Uni
versity of California for participation
in the campus riot which followed Cap
tain Nance's order to his class a month
ago, the fourteen seniors whose cases
were reported on by Nance a week ago
Are to be placed on probation with the
forty-eight men who were put on pro
bation by President Whealer a fortnight
-ago.
It developed to-day that President
Wheeler, who has steadily refused to
discuss the cases of these fourteen se
niors, wrote to their parents a week
ago. Informing the "folks at home" that
the son at college had participated in a
reprehensible riot and that Captain
Nance had found his explanation un
satisfactory- It was expected that each
man then would receive a letter from
home advising the alleged offender to
=\va!k softly and escape the official ax,
if possible, by keeping close to the
straight and narrow path of obedience
to constituted authority. This solution
of the difficulty has apparently been
â successful, for the orders of Captain
Nance have now become as law and
gospel to the seniors, who march as
they are bidden, quietly and with none
tit the demonstrations that were wont
to accompany their movements.
. Thus far W. T. Hale, former editor of
the Daily Calif ornian, who was given
a banquet by his classmates in Oakland
to-night, is the only man to receive
actual punishment for his connection
with the military riot. He was sus
pended for a year. There are sixty-two
ir.eri row on probation, this constitut
ing the only punishment meted out to
the men, who were, expected to suffer
severely for defying Captain Nance's
authority. It is the prevalent belief in
fhe senior class that Editor Hale was
made a vicarious sacrifice for his fel
hiws and that the object lesson thus
provided was deemed sufficient by the
.tznlveralty authorities to create a spirit
f f respect for the military commander's
orders.
Gustav White, president of the col
lege Y. M. C. A., Is still on the anxious
seat, however, as his case alone re
mains to be passed on by Nance and
Wheeler. He has filed affidavits to
Fhow that he had no connection with
the riot, but still he remains In sus
pense. His name was not reported un
til several days after the riot, and this
partly accounts for the delay in his
case.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1904.
OAKLAND, Dec. 3.â Burllngame in
all Its glory never presented a more
brilliant spectacle than that seen to
day at the opening of the new Clare
mont Country Club. Everything was
auspicious and the phenomenal csecu
auspicious and the pronounced success
of the club's initial event promises
much for its future growth and well
being.
The club-house, a picturesque, vine
clad building, is ideally situated in the
midst of "Rockridge Park." Hedges,
covered with roses whose perfume filled
the air to-day, inclose the well-kept
lawns and flower gardens, the tennis
courts, croquet grounds and bowling
green. Splendid golf links extend over
a goodly portion of the grounds, and
there is also a fine shooting range. The
Fifth Regiment band was on the lawn
in front of the club-house, and its stir
ring music added to the gayety of an
event hitherto unrivaled In Oakland.
Representatives of the Burlingame set
and notables from San Francisco min
gled in the kaleidoscopic throng that
filled the richly furnished club-rooms
and overflowed into the gardens, where
lutomobiles, smart turnouts and eques
trians added their quota to the general
animation. v. ~:
As for the interior of the club-house,
there was nothing but praise . for its
spacious apartments, Its artistic fur
nishing and the air of comfort and lux
ury that, everywhere prevailed. To-day,
of course, the rooms wore a gala ap
pearance, a , delightfully harmonious
arrangement of chrysanthemums and
roses adorning every possible nook and
corner. On the wide veranda a deli
cious luncheon was served, and in the
hallway the thirsty guests found a
seemingly inexhaustible punch.
To many the beautiful club-house
and its romantic surroundings, shad
owed on One side by Berkeley's misty
hills and overlooking on the other a
panoramic view of Oakland and the
bay, was a revelation, for few have re
alized that at the city's very door was
a spot destined to rival famed country
clubs across ,the bay.
Several interesting tournaments oc
cupied the attention of lovers of out
door sport this afternoon. Frank
Kales won the club cup In the golf con
test. On the bowling green the Oak
land Scotch Bowling Club defeated. the
San Francisco Scotch Bowling Club by
two points. In the tennis contest Sam
Hardy and Dr. Hill were defeated' by
Dr. Sumner Hardy and Percy Murdock,
their score being 6-4^ 2-6, 7-5, 3-8 and
fi-6.

MUCH SHOOTING;
NO HARM DONE
ZEIGLER. 111., Dec. 3.â Two dis
tinct attacks have been made on the
Gordon blockhouse, situated half way
between the pump and the adminis
tration building of the coal company.
One attack was at 7 o'clock and the
second was begun at 10:25 o'clock to
night , Brisk firing from the outside
is maintained, the soldiers replying
with rapid fire runs.
. DUQUOIN, 111., Deo. 3.â After several
months of labor trouble at the Letter
mines. In the- town of Zeigler, during
whioh many reports of active skirmish
ing have been sent out, the situation at
Zelgler is one of the most peculiar in
the history of recent labor disagree
ments.
It is said by disinterested persons liv
ing near Zelgler that firing has been
heard every night for several weeks at
the stockade surrounding the mines
and pumphouse, several miles from
town. After a thorough investigation
however, staff correspondents of the St.
Louis newspapers declare they have not
been able to find any marks of bullets,
either on the stockade or at the pump
house. .':.;.*
Reports sent out from surrounding
town that miners and strikers have
been wounded have proved, upon In
vestigation, to be unfounded.
From the latest authentic reports,
there are about twenty-five men en
camped about four miles from Zelgler.
In the town there are about eighty
miners, eighty-five militiamen and for
ty deputy marshals, Including both
State and Federal officers.
Although generally termed "strikers,"
the officials of the union, authorized
to speak for the men, declare that they
are not . on a strike. They say that
Joseph Lelter offered a wage scale to
which they could not agree, and so
they left the mines. They deny all
knowledge of the alleged attacks on
the town of Zeigher.

AMERICA MAY BE USED
AS JiODEL BY FRANCOS
Position of Church and State in This
Country Strongly Indorsed by
Cardinal Perrand.
PARIS. Deo. 3. â Cardinal Perraud.
the foremost figure- in the French
hierarchy and a member of tha
French Academy, has written a letter
strongly approving of the American
system of the Independence of church
and state, indicating that the Ameri
can system offers the basis for a re
organization of the French system,
when the forthcoming separation of
church and state in Franco is ac
complished.
This is the prevailing view in thÂ«
highest clerical circles, which havÂ«
been attracted to the American system
by the Abbe Kleins' recent book dedi
cated to President Roosevelt, in which
the advantages of the American sys
tem are contrasted with the disad
vantages of the French system.

There's Only One Way to
Get the Best of Whisky
And tlmt is to let It alone. If you try
any other way It wiU get the ..best of
you. If you can't let it alone you need
Dr. McKanna's treatment. Dr. McKan-
na cures the liquor habit by destroying
the. desire for liquor and putting the
rystem in its natural condition, where
li<i'-<"" 1* not needed to help the machin-
ery of the body to do its work. Dr.
McKanr.a effects a complete cure In three
days without the use of dangerous hy-
podermics, annoying confinement or bad
after effects. Dr. McKanna's treatment
is absolutely safe and cannot harm *the
most delicate constitution. Why waste
time and money in drinking whisky
when you can be cured of the liquor
liabit in' three days with no chance of
failure, no risk and no unpleasantness?
Think it over and call or write Dr. Me-
Kanna for full information. Address 14

Nine Damage Suits Filed
as Result of Explosion on
the Steamship Progreso
Nine suits for damages for injuries
and deaths resulting from the explosion
on thÂ« steamer Progrreao Decem
ber 8, 1901, were fljed yester
day againit the Fulton Engineering
and Shipbuilding Works. William T>en
man is attorney for seven of the plain
tiffs, and Sullivan & SulliVan for two.
The Progreso was moored in the com
pany's yards and was- being recon
structed. For the purpose of testing
the engines,- afl oil tank was partly
filled with petroleum for fuel. It is
charged that the oil was of dangerous
quality, and that the tank had no ven
tilator to carry off the explosive gases.
Because of this alleged negligence, the
explosion is said to have occurred.
The actions by Denmarr are begun
for Mary Nelson, widow of Edward
W. Nelson, killed, for $20,000; Eleanor
E. Dow, widow of Howard W. â¢Dow,
killed, for $20,030; Sabiria Gallagher,
widow, and seven children, of Daniel
Gallagher, killed,. $20,000; Hugh McGill,
Injured, ?20,525; Robert E. Gibson, in
jured, $21,150; George W. McEnerney,
injured, S5P0O; Edward Kane, injured,
$10,750. Most of the men were thrown
xiol^ntly against the side of the ship
by the explosion, and Gibson had both
legs and a hand broken, and his teeth
knocked out.
One of , Sullivan &. Sullivan's clients
is Harry Connama, a, minor, who.was
employed as a -helper. ' His "left arm
was so badly mangled that it* had to
bo amputated. _. He sues for $25,000.
Frank and -Ann. McGulre,' parents of
James McGuire, "who was killed, , sue
for $50,000.
The demands of the victims of the
disaster aggregate $193,025.

THE : SAN; FRANCISCO CALL;,; SUNDAY, DECEMBER;; 4; 1904:
ADMINISTRATOR
A BODY GUARD
Ciinninsfliain's Opportunity
to Study the Affairs of the
Late Chew Bing Quoia
AVIDOW- IS QUESTIONED
Local Claimant of Estate
Says She Was Born Here.
Certificate Is Sent For
J. J. Cunningham, whose removal as
administrator of the estate of Chew
Bin? Quoia, the deceased Chinese la
bor contractor, is sought, was on the
stand in Judge CofCey's court yes
terday and told of his relations
with the Chinaman. He said that
he was Quota's body guard for
three years and later was inter
ested in some of his contracts. He
employed the watchmen for the ships
and also the Japanese who were taken
to Alaska with the Chinese coolies. He
declared that Chew Bins Quoia intro
duced Lum Quoia As his wife. The wit
ness was do^ permitted to tell of the
financial condition of the estate, but
went far enough to say, that put of
three contracts they lost $12,000 on two
of them.
Lu;n Quoia, the local claimant, testi
fied that she was living with her father
and mother on Sacrcamehto street
when she married Quota. She also said
that she was born in this country and
was registered as a resident Chinese,
but that the registry -certificate had
been burned. Judge Dibble, attorney
for the other side, remarked that the
certificate had not been burned and he
would produce it in court. Later, when
he asked for a continuance to Decem
ber 1C, he said that he had written to
the Department of Commerce and La
bor at Washington for the original cer
tificate of Lum Quoia and Ng She, who
is said to have brought the girl as a
slave from China in 1893.
Lee Mee Toy, a merchant in China
town, was called to contradict the evi
dence of Low Doon, brother of Low
She, the alleged widow in China. Doon
had testified that his sister had not
married, and that he did not know
Chew Lum, son of Quoia and Ngr She, a
"second wife.". Toy declares that Doon
came to him and asked him to bail
Chew Lum out of Jail, stating at the
time that Chew Lum was his "nephew."
This is explained by the Chinese cus
tom of having the children of secondary
wives call the first wifa mother.
Chew Fong testified that he lived in
the same house with Lum Quoia and
Ng She, on Sacramento street, at the
time Lum says she was living at home
with her parents.
Thomas 8. Burns, a notary, testified
that Lum Quoia had made her mark on
the petition for the appointment of
Cunningham as administrator, but he
could not eayrthat- she understood its
contents. Ti'PiKh't
Kicked by a Horse.
Wolf >Ioritz. residing at 147 Har
riet street, had ' the bone of his fef t
leg broke at the knee joint yesterday
by a kick from a vicious horse, which
he was driving on Harrison street.
The injured man was taken to the City
and County Hospital, where Dr. W. M.
LÂ«wl<>r set the broken limb.
James Anderson, who lives in South
San Francisco, was kicked on the left
leg by a horse that was standing In
front of a stable on Shipley street yes
terday afternoon. His left leg was
fractured below the knee. <*Dr. P.
Collischon of Folsom street reduced
the fracture.

LESS DANGER BY
OVER ONE HALE
Harriman Is Safeguarding
Against Loss of Life and
Property on His System
INCEEASES EFFICIENCY
Results of Signal Tests
Lead to Strict Orders
and Better * Discipline
Under Instructions from Julius
Kruttschnltt, . director of maintenance
and operations of the Harriman ljnes.
Manager Agler of the Southern Pacific,
Company has issued bulletins to the
trainmen along the entire Western
system of the road admonishing them
to exert the, greatest precaution dur
ing the remainder of the year against
accidents. v Thls order Is \ the out
growth of a- theory prevailing among
experienced railroad operators - that
trainmen, during the jollity of the
holiday season, unconsciously become
more lax In obeying train rules estab
lished for the safety of passengers
and property than is customary. A
similar order has also been issued to
division superintendents to apply to
the dally work of track walkers and
other classes of employes on the va
rious sections.
For a number of months Julius
Kruttschnltt has been" carefully ex
perimenting with signal tests on the
different big systems of the Harriman
lines with a view of determining the
effect of the strict enforcement of dis
cipline and as a result he has succeed
ed in reducing the number of casual
ties nearly 50 per cent, a record that
has not been attained by any other
transcontinental system in the United
States.
When the tests were first inaugu^ |
rated strong opposition was aroused j
among men in the operating depart-}
ments on the ground that' it was an
uriwarrahted Innovation in operating
methods. Director Kruttschnltt, how- I
ever, persisted in his plans and as a!
result of the first tests It was found!
that on certain parts of the Harriman j
systems the observance of signals was '
as low as 64.2 per cent, and this de- j
spite the fact that the road had :
gained the reputation among its ri- j
vals of being well disciplined. Ac- 1
cording to these tests In nearly forty |
instances engineers had run past a j
signal -set at "danger" or had disre- j
garded other precautions against loss I
of life and property.
These startling disclosures were
quickly followed by a general order
requiring .division superintendents to
make signal tests every month and re
port the results. The i discipline in
each case of failure was by the Brown
system, r , which makes promotion de
pendent on an employe's efficiency as
disclosed by a. complete marking sys
tem. The tests were Inaugurated over
all the roads composing the Harriman \
combine, with the result that in Octo-j
ber last there was a total of 933 with
the remarkable record of only five
failures, thereby increasing the ef
fiency to 99.5. As the failures were of
an unimportant nature the director of
maintenance and operations of the
Harriman lines has accepted the rec
ord as showing perfection In operation
so far as observing signals is con
cerned.
Director Kruttschnltt has now is
sued a table showing that on. a train
mileage basis the average number of
casualties along the Harriman lines
during this year was only 50 per cent
of the average of all the railroads in
the United States. It is the intention
of Director Kruttschnitt to make a se
ries of tests during the coming year
with a view of still further perfecting
the method of operating trains if pos
sible.

RUSSIAN TAKES
JAPANESE WIFE
Alliance, However, Does Not
Save CaptainBollmanFroni
Being Treated as a Spy
SEAKCHED AT YOKOHAMA
Passenger on Gaelic Is Sub
mitted to Eigorous Treat
ment in Island Kingdom
Captain A. G. Bollman, who arrived
from the Orient yesterday on the liner
Gaelic, is a Russian who admires
Japan and likes the Japanese so well
that he wooed and won for wife a
pretty daughter of the island kingdom.
This evidence of regard, while satis
factory to Mrs. Bollman, was uncon
vincing to the Japanese authorities,
I who persisted in regarding Bollman as
i a probable spy and treated him. ac
cordingly. > At the first Japanese port
jat which the Gaelic called Bollman
i was submitted to a searching exami
nation, then to an actual search and
afterward at other ports to the closest
surveillance.
Captain Bollman is interested in the
fisheries of Saghalin Island and holds a
concession there from . the Russian
Government. His concession was
granted three days before the war was
declared and so far has availed him
nothing. He left Port Arthur two days
before Japan opened the conflict.
After spending some months in Man
churia Captain Bollman rejoined his
family at Yokohama, but had not
been home long before he found him
self an object of suspicion in the eyes
of official Japan. Business called him
away and when he returned he found
that Japanese interest in his move
ments had increased to the point of
annoyance.
Before leaving on his trip to this
country he took his family to Hong
kong, fearing, .that the reputation of
having a Russian husband might make
life uncomfortable for his wife. When
he returned to Yokohama as a through
passenger^ on the Gaelic he went
ashore to attend to some businessman^!
was immediately seized and put
through a few special degrees by the
secret service /officials. His clothes
were taken away from him and
searched and his effects on board the
Gaelic were also carefully gone
through. Finding nothing to warrant
further detention he was released, but
was not lost sight of by the secret ser
vice police until he returned to the

THE VALUE OP CHAKCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is In
preserving Health- and Beauty. \
Nearly, everybody; knows [ that char-
coal is the safest "and most ' efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature,
but â  few realize Its value â when . taken
into the human system for the same
cleansing; purpose. -^ s
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is , not a
drug at' all," but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present
in the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them ' out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or. after | eating on-
ions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Im-
proves the complexion ; it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
AH druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most for the
money is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozen-
ges; they are composed of the finest
powdered Willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form,
or rather ln the form of large, pleas-
ant tasting lozenges, the charcoal be-
ing mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the greneral health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but, on the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I advise
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but; 25 cents a box at
drug stores and although in some
sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
any of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

ANOTHER QUEER ACTION
"; IS BEGUN BY IiAPIQUE
Pork Packer, , Who Studied Law In
Prison. Seeks to Annul a Num
ber of Court Decrees.
John Lapique, the pork packer,
who spent the greater part of ten
year's in prison studying law and then
surprised forty-five lawyers, officials
and citizens by suing them for
$650,000 damages for malicious prose
cution, has begun another suit in the
Superior Court. ; <->
Yesterday, in proprla persona, he
filed a complaint containing twenty
eight typewritten pages and praying
for twenty separate decrees and deci
sions of court. In this case the de
fendants are not so numerous, there,
being only nineteen of them, includ
ing Abraham Ruef, who headed the
list in the other action. The defend
ants are described as guardians, ad
ministrators, attorneys, clerks, agents,
etc., of the estate of Jean Louis Ader,
deceased, and friends, relatives and
servants of the plaintiff. They are
charged with having conspired to
coerce him to transfer valuable per
sonal property, extorting money from
him and to conceal their own fraudu
lent acts by bringing many insanity
and â¢ criminal charges against him,
which resulted in his imprisonment
for periods aggregating ten years.
The action in this instance Is to set
aside a dozen or more court decrees,
sales, etc.. In connection with the set
tlement of the Ader estate. He claims
that in 1895 he owned the fittings and
business of the Silver King lodging
house at 514 Bush street, worth $1450.
He claims that this was wrongfully
taken from him and sold and that he
was forced to sign certain claims
against the Ader estate under threats
of Imprisonment. He also says he
was compelled in the same way to In
dorse a note for $1000 to the defend
ants. He wants the note paid, the
$1450 and $200 a month damages from
July, 1895, to date.

REPORT IS THAT McCORMICK
WILL BE GENERAL MANAGER
May Soon Return to the City as
Southern Pacific Chief.
It tvas reported in this city yesterday,
on what appears to be good authority,
that ~K. O. McCormick, former paa
fxnjrer traffic manager of the Southern
Pacific Company and now assistant
trafilr: director of the Harriman lines,
will shortly return to San Francisco as
vice president and general manager of
vhe Southern Pacific. According to" in
formation received here, General Man
ager Bancroft was transferred here
pending- negotiations between President
Harriman and McCormick, and that
the latter official, who only recently re-"
rr.cved his family to Chicago, was final
ly persuaded to accept the position of
head of the big Western road.
The news, if true, will be pleasing
to not only ail railroad officials con
nected with the Southern Pacific Com
pany, but the general public on this
coast, which formed a strong attach
ment for the genial passenger traffic
manager of the company during his
eeveral years' stay in this city. The
popularity of McCormick on the Pacific
Coast has no doubt deeply Impressed
President Harriman, for few railroad
officials have succeeded In getting clos
er in touch with the shippers and the
traveling public on this side of the con
tinent than McCormick. Another strong
ppint in his favor is that he made him^
Eelf thoioughly acquainted with the
needs of the coast and is credited with
having dene more toward advancing
its interests and especially tWat of Cal
ifornia, during his stay here, than any
other railroad man in the employ of the
Southern Pacinc Company.
'Although spoken of here as a pas
senger traffic man, McCormick has
had considerable experience in other
branches of railroading and is well
qualified to fill the position of general
manager. His career as a railroad
operator began when he was a small
boy in Lafayette, Ind., where he hung
around the railroad station doing
chores without compensation. Later
he became a water boy to' a section
gang, for which service he received
hardly enough wages to keep himself
in suspender money, but his patience
was finally rewarded when the sec
tion gang boss unfortunately lost a
leg and McCormick was appointed to
his place.
-Beginning with that appointment
McCormick's rise in the railroad
world was rapid. He was shifted
from operating to traffic departments,
but always advancing, until he finally
was made commercial agent of one of
the big roads at Louisville. Next he
â¢was made general agent of the Monon
read at Louisville, and later went to
Chicago as a general passenger agent.
It was about this time that the Cin
cinnati, Hamilton and Dayton road
was suffering from heavy competition
from rival lines and It sought to be
come master of the situation by tak
ing McCormick over as its general
passenger agent. But tho road could
not hold him. The Vanderbilts, dis
covering that he was a valuable man,
offered him a big salary to join them
as traffic manager of the Big Four.
The title was one of the first of Its
kind conferred on a railroad man in
this country.
From the Big Four McCormick was
captured by Harriman and sent to this
c'ty, where in less than three months
he had become acquainted with nearly
every big shipper and traveling man
::i the State and had entered into every
public project designed to better Cali
fornia. He was a success from the
start, but Just as the public had thor
oughly settled in its mind that it had
t'Bured a valuable adjunct to its list
ol*b5g men, J. C. Stubbs induced Presi
dent Harriman to make McCormick
assistant traffic director of the Harri
ra&n lines, with headquarters in Chi

FCGITITE FROM
JUSTICE FOUND
A. Gr. Schwartz, Ex- Assistant
Secretary Phoenix Build
ing Association^ Arrested
- A. G. Schwartz, who fled from the
city in January last, is under arrest in
Mexico, and the papers for his extradi
tion will be prepared as soon as possi
ble and an officer sent to bring him
back to stand his trial on a charge of
felony embezzlement.
Schwartz was assistant secretary of
the Phoenix Savings, Building and
Loan Association and had the entire
confidence of Clarence Grange, the sec
retary. On January 17 Schwartz dis
appeared, and a hurried , examination
of his accounts showed that he Was a
defaulter to the extent of about $12,000.
A warrant was sworn to before Police
Judge Fritz on February 2 for
Schwartz's arrest on a charge of felony
embezzlement and the case was placed
in the hands of the Pinkerton detective
agency. A reward was also offered for
information that would lead to his ar
rest. Since then every effort has been
made by the Pinkerton detectives and
the local police to discover traces of
Schwartz, and it was only a few days
ago that he was located in a town in
Mexico. He was placed under arrest,,
and yesterday steps were taken to pre
pare the papers for his extradition.
The way in which Schwartz succeed
ed in embezzling such a large sum was
simple. All the moneys audited by thfe
association have to be passed by the
auditing committee and a check for the
amount signed by the president and at
least three of the directors. All moneys
are paid out once a month. In order to
meet the demands between times when
the checks are audited the secretary
and cashier use their personal funds to
meet the obligations. It was this money
that Schwartz embezzled.
Schwartz is a son of Henry Schwartz,
a wealthy retired bookmaker, and his
father promised at first to pay up his
son's indebtedness, but later changed
his mind.

SMALL HEADWAY IS MADE
IN THE POLICE INQUIRY
PUBLISHERS. FAIL TO APPEAR
Will Give Testimony To-Morrow
in an Executive Session.
Little progress was made yesterday
in the investigation of the scandal\^n
volving the police and their relations
with the gambling games in China
town. Those who have made the spe
cific charges again failed to appear.
They sent word that they would: tell
what they know in an executive ses
sion of the Police Commission, and
agreeable to this exaction the board
adjourned to 2 o'clock Monday, when
the testimony will be heard . behind
closed doors.
Several witnesses were before the
Commissioners yesterday. Evidence
of a vague nature was adduced tending
to implicate members of the China
town squad. The incriminating testi
mony was that of two Chinese, and
while it appeared to be fairly well es
tablished that every fantan table paid
a tribute of $5 a week, ostensibly for
protection from the police, there was
nothing to show what became of the
money. It looks as if it will remain
for the newspaper owner j and his
managing editor to establish any
clinching proof of* corruption if the
trouble that Commissioner Hutton
stirred up by his unexpected visit to
Chinatown and call on Sergeant El
lis is to be fathomed. The demand
for a star chamber hearing indicates
that nothing will be accomplished
ultimately but to emphasize the prob
ability, which has long been a mat
ter of almost common knowledge, that
there are levies and rake-offs in
Chinatown and that to expose the cor
ruption is Impossible.
R. A. Crothers and Fremont Older
were again represented yesterday by
Thomas Hickey as attorney. The
Commissioners had adjourned from
the day. before: that the newspaper,
men might -.change' Jthelrj minds 'apd
obey the isubpenaes '". served'? on *th'em>
But they were not in sight at 2 o'clock
and without a comment concerning
them the board went ahead with the
investigation. When all the witnesses
in attendance had been heard the call
was made late in the day for Older
and Crothers. Hickey responded for
them and announced their willingness
to testify if they could do so behind
closed doors.
A. Ruef entered a strong protest to
secret proceedings. He was present
to represent the municipal officials,
himself and others who had been ac
cused, he said, in reply to Hickey.
The debate between the lawyers
waxed warm. "Hickey declared that
the only purpose of asking for. an ex
ecutive session was that the publish
ers might have protection from per
sonal attack by Ruef. The latter was
hot with the retort that it was mere
ly desired to take advantage -of an op
portunity for garbling reports of the
proceedings.
Commissioner Howell explained
that the stenographer would take
down the testimony offered arid; the
record would be available to meet
any unfair play. There was much ex
cited discussion, but the matter was
finally adjusted in a somewhat indef
inite way. No one is to be present
but the Commissioners and the sten
ographer when the newspaper men
testify and Ruef is somehow, it was
assumed, to have protection from in
justice to himself or his clients.
ELLIS' EXPLANATION.
Commissioner Hutton is still bent
on ascertaining how the Chinese
learned of his presence In Chinatown
Monday night directly after his note
was delivered to Sergeant Ellis, who
was then in command of the police
squad. The sergeant protests inno
cence and gives a plausible explana
tion. Lieutenant Anderson and some
friends, Ellis says, were hunting for
him to take them through Chinatown
at {he very hour Hutton sent his note
by the messenger boyasking the ser
geant to meet him. The Chinese like
ly took fright, he . adds, at the ap
pearance of the lieutenant, and Hut
ton might not at all have been re
sponsible for the great excitement
that he thought he created.
Ellis says the note was given him by
the boy at 9:30 o'cleck, when he and
Anderson were temporarily separated.
He made a hasty attempt to find An
derson that he might excuse himself,
and failing to do this ran to the corner
of Powell and Clay streets, where. he
met Hutton. He claims he i did not
speak to a single person after receiving
the note, and better to escape "observa
tion chose the broad streets, avoiding
the alleys. He knows he was followed
every -step of the way by Chinese and
white spies. It is his opinion that the
presence of Lieutenant Anderson dis
turbed the gamblers, as word was
spread around Chinatown that a cap
tain of â¢ police and a number . of detec
tives were yisltihg the quarter to close
down the games. .
Commissioner Hutton was the first
witness called when the â ' investigation
-was resumed. He began by raising a
doubt as to* the truth of Sergeant Ellis'
statement that it took him flyeTmin
utes, though he ; ran all the waj(, to
reach' ttie^ point where the Commission
er was waiting < for him , last , Monday
night. "The messenger: who > delivered
the, note'found the officer, in frontj.of
the Chinese _; theater. 'â¢â" Hutton testified
thatVyesterday morning he walked ; ;' at
an : ordinary gait : the distance the ser-^
eearit ran. and did sq in" three and a'
quarter or three and a half minutes.
It was clear the Commissioner had not
absolved Ellis from blame for the warn
ing the fantan houses must have re
ceived. '-â ..', ,
"Do you know of any gambling games
being conducted upstairs in China
town?" asked Reagan.
â  "From hearsay I do," Hutton an
swered. "I have heard > considerable
about that the last three months. Last
month I was told that gambling
was carried on upstairs in the day
time and downstairs at night. In the
latter part of November I was informed
the games were compelled' to move
downstairs altogether."
CHINESE WERE WARNED.
"What reasons have you for believing
that the Chinese were notified of your
presence in Chinatown last Monday
night, when you sent the note to Ser
geant Ellis to meet you?"
"They must have been notified. I have
often been in Chinatown before, but
never before did I see such crowds of
Chinamen out on the street looking at
me: Every gambling-house was closed,
which was- alsq^an J unusual circum
stance. There must have been some un
usual excitement to bring so many
Chinamen into the street at that time."
Commissioner Hutton then gave way
to Sergeant Jesse B. Cook, who had
been transferred from the harbor dis
trict to Chinatown to take Ellis' place
in command of the squad detailed to
suppress gambling. Cook said that he
was on similar duty in Chinatown for
four months In the latter part of 1902
and in the early part of 1903. Since his
return a few days ago he has canvassed
the quarter thoroughly and the places
where gambling has been going on un
til the present investigation, but â¢ he.
found that the number of houses-de
voted to fantan was about the same as
that of- the games in operation two
years ago. According to his statement
there has virtually, beenv no Increase in
gambling in Chinatown, since 1902. He
stamped it out the four months he was
In charge of .'the squad there, but only
by hard work, finally vrore himout
and compelled hinvto ask to' be "trans
ferred to. an easier station." 'V '.;.'
i "Do ; you think . gambling can be sup
pressed .in Chinatown?" queried Com
missioner Hutton. â 
The witness slowly shook his head,
smiled and then said, "It would be a
terrible Job to do it; I can't say."
Hutton, apparently more hopeful that
the vice could be removed, pressed the
Witness, but Sergeant Cook, speaking
from experience of many years during
which he had been: stationed in the Chi
nese quarter off and on, did not give
strong encouragement. ...
"Did the Chief of Police or any one
else ever ask you to protect gambling
iu Chinatown?" asked Ruef.
"No, sir," was the answer of Ser
geant Cook.
TALK OF POLICE VISITS.
Lee Sing, member of the so-called
"Educational Society," testified that
he had been employed as doorkeeper
for the fantan game conducted at 826
Washington * street and was on duty
when the ! telephone message came
Monday evening from a Chinese
named Wong Yu to "Close up because
sergeants and detectives were coming
up." Wong Yu was telephoning from
another gambling house on Ross alley
and he asked that other places in the
vicinity of., the Washington-street re
sort be notified at ojace. The witness
knew nothing, however, of how the
alarm came to be spread.
"Do you know of any money being
paid for protection from the police?"
"I onlyv heard other -people say so."
"Did yo"u ever see any policemen in
the gambling houses ?"
"I have seen them come up and go
away." (,
"Did you see any policemen at 820
Washington street last. Saturday or
Sunday?"
. "I Baw them come up to the second
door. The / inside door was closed
when they appeared, shutting them
from the fantan room. They soon left.
On Saturday I was gambling in a
house on Spofford alley and the officers
came to the door and kicked it. The
interpreter was called and when he'
arrived the policemen were allowed in-,
side. He took them off to a side and
had a talk with them, after which he .
told us all to go out. HÂ« ordered us to
leave slowly by twos and ' threes, be
cause a rush would attract too much
attention. There were two policemen,'
but they were not in uniform."
The witness was ; not asked if he
could identify, the .officers.
Through Dr. Gardner, acting as in
terpreter, Chin Fay testified that â¢ he
was interested in a gambling house
in' Ross alley, where fantan games
have been ' running for years. The,
place was closed . for a time and '= re- ;
opened a few "months ago.
"Did you ever have a talk with any-,
body about V contributing $ 5 to- a
fund?" was asked.
"It was not' I. It was the banker of
the â  house. , He talked with a man
through an interpreter. We were tpld :
there : would be ; trouble with the po
lice." ;:'-â¢;.
"Tell what you know of any such'
trouble." l

was opened the, police began to bother!

Guy, who told us it would be neces
sary to pay $25 a week for protection.
As we had but two tables running we
said that this was too much, and the
amount was finally reduced to $10.
After this there were no more raids.
The l police would come in and ' look
around, but we would stop playing as
they entered the room and no arrests
were made."
"Were you in a place in Spofford
alley I about a week ago when > the
police entered the place?"
"Yes. Just before -the officers en
tered all the gambling implements
were put away. When the police en
tered some one spoke to them and
they left the place. We r/ere told to
stay there awhile and, then. go out at
intervals, singly or in couples."
"What was the money paid to Chin
Bock Guy for?"
. "I do not know."
FIVE DOLLARS A TABLE.
On being questioned by Ruef the
witness admitted that- he also owned :
a gambling-house â¢â  ' on Washington
street, between 'Dupont and Stockton.!
This house contains six tables and the
regular tribute of $5 a table is paid to
one of the "eight statesmen" and "an
other $5 is passed over to some mys
terious person for an unknown pur
pose. . . :-,. â 
The money is paid over regularly
by the witness* banker, as his books
show, but '. he has never seen it paid.
So far as he can ; understand $5 a
table tribute is levied by the See Yups
for running expenses of the society
and the other. $6 a table goes to the
gamblers' : association.- The police
have not molested his place since the
paying of the tribute money.-
Dr. Gardner inspected the. books of
the r gambling-house taken by Com
missioner Hutton in his raid last
Tuesday night. They showed that
while all such items . as rent, insur
ance, light and sundry supplies were
carefully itemized, $40 â¢ a 1 week , was
paid regularly to the collector for. the
See' Yups and another $40 ; was
"charged to "incidentals.'' There} was
nothing^ in the book indicating ' to
whom the $40 for incidentals was
paid over or what' became of it.
Sergeant Blank was called ; and
asked for ah explanation of . the fall
ing off in the number;of arrests made
of fantan and lottery gamblers when
he was in charge , of ..the Chinatown
squad last summer. He said he pre
sumed the principal ' reason : was that
there was not so much "gaming going
on.) H*J did not testify very satisfac- t
torily, but will be called again to
bring the private record he has of the s
arrests made by ' the squad.

MRS. CENTER'S
NEW SENSATION
Serious Charges Begarding
Contra Costa Directors'
Deal for Pinole Tract
Following her sensational suit of
Thursday charging the directors of the
Contra Costa Water Company with the
misappropriation of $295,000, Mrs.
Jeanne D. Center, a stockholder in the
corporation, yesterday filed another ac
tion demanding $773,167 77 damages, an
accounting of the use of 8000 shares of
the company's stock, the appointment
of a receiver for the shares and an in
junction"' restraining Wellington Gregg
Jr. from disposing of them pending the
trial of the case." Her attorneys are
Baggett. Jones & Sheridan. ,
Mrs. Center directs her accusations
and demands against William J. Din
gee, H. G. Stevenson, Charles C. Bemis,
Thomas P. Pheby, A. H. Winn, A. W.
Rose, Edwin Schwab, Wellington
Gregg Jr., the Contra Costa Water
Company and the Bay Counties â¢ Land
and Development Company. All of
those named, as well as the late Al
vlnza. Hay ward, had to do with the
transfer of the Pinole tract to the water
company, and Mrs. Center declares the
Contra Costa directors profited person
ally to the extent of several hundred
thousand dollars by the deal.
The complainant sets forth that on
February 3, 1903, the directors, of whom
Hay ward was one, passed a resolution
for the purchase of the Pinole tract
from Edwin Schwab and the Bay Coun
ties Land and Development. Company
and to issue in payment .therefor 8000
shares of the Contra Costa Company's
stock and $73,167 77 in. cash. The stock,
the par value of which was $300,000.
was delivered to the Bay Counties Com
pany and the cash was paid to Ber
nardo Fernandez. .
Mrs. .Center alleges that the land so
purchased and paid for .was of no
greater value than $100,000. She de
clares that the Bay" Counties Company
was .created by the defendants other
than the Contra Costa Company as a
medium - through which . the ; title to the
land ; might come ; to the Contra Costa
Company, and that the tract, was con
veyed to the latter company at a price
largely in excess of. the price paid,, and
that . the difference between the price
paid the original \ owner and the price
paid by the Contra Costa Company It
was Intended should be appropriated by
the defendants.
She charges that Schwab was merely
the agent and employe of the. defend
ants and that the Bay Counties Com
pany was merely an agent > to ) receive
and hold the shares for Dingee, Steven
son,' Bemis, Winn and Rose.- Gregg, It
is -said, holds the shares as trustee for
the others. As in the. former' suit, the
plaintiff 'says that she '.requested, the
board "of 'directors to bring an action,
but It refused.
The new water-wagon recently pre
sented to the city by the president of
the. Park Board, Adolph B. Spreckels,
was officially tested yesterday after
noon on the main drive of Golden Gate
Park, and fulfilled all the predictions
as to its general superiority over the
sprinkler now In use.
The new water-cart was purchased
last summer in Vienna by Mr.
Spreckels and Edward Aigeltinger, who
own the American patents, with the ob
ject of using them in the park. There
are over thirty of the wagons in use at
the public parks and race tracks of
Vienna.
- The water is received into a large
boiler-shaped receptacle of riveted and
reinforced iron, and is forced by com
pressed air through a sieve of gradu
ated holes larger than an eighth of an
inch in diameter. This air Is forced
into the tank by a pump under the
body of the wagon. The pump Is op
erated by a gear attached to the rear
wheel.
By means of brakes and graduated
scales the water may be controlled so
that a slight sprinkle will lay the dust,
or, by exerting full pressure, a radius
of 100 feet can be evenly watered. One
machine therefore could wet down both
sides of Market street at the same time.
A special featcre of the wagon is that
all the water is evenly distributed and
none is wasted.
It is planned to have a test of oil
sprinkling soon. This will necessitate
the placing of a larger sieve at the rear
of the wagon. '
Adolph B. Spreckles, Edward Aigel
tinger, Superintendent McLaren and
John Martin witnessed the test, which
was conducted under the supervision of
Park Engineer Irwin. All were pleased
with the results. The various sections
of the sieve were tried . in succession,
then alternately, and then by twos, but
not a hitch developed. The trail in the
wake of the wagon narrowed and wid
ened as the lever was regulated, but
no puddles formed and the water was
evenly laid.

McDonald Calls Tom Shee

The Tigers sent Danny Shay
through in the ninth spasm yesterday
at Recreation Park and broke up a
tame that promised to go tor twen
ty rounds If the light did not fell.
Bobby Eagar let one of Baum's rptt
L-alls slip through his mitts and Shay
romped in from third base. Just be
fore that time a close decision hap
pened, which gave the Tigers the bast
of it. Score, 1 to 0.
Neither side had come close to gei
ting a man over till Shay worked
Charley Baum for a pass in the ninth,
irheehan laid down a bunt and Bavrn
r.ent along the first base line to get
it. He picked it up before it rolled
foul and apparently touched Sheehm.
Umpire McDonald ruled the runner
was safe, so the Tigers had two men
on sacks and nobody out.
Noidyke rapped a saucy one to
Flood, und Sheehan was forced at
second, while Shay proceeded to third.
Dyke stole on the first ball pitched
and the Angel infield played In for
McLaughlin at the bat. Baum put
one good one over, but the next w^s
wide and Eagar let it get away from
him, thus allowing the first, last a-i<1
only tally to score.
The game was the prettiest of the
series and as good as any fan could
â¢wish to view. Baum used a spit lidl
and it was a constant source of worry
to the wily tigers. Keefe had oig
curves, which made the Angels sv.ing
vainly trying to hit. They bunched
two bingles on him in the third, but
neither counted.
Errors were few and did no dam
age. The infields of both teams played
bright, sparkling ball and 'many ap
parently safe bingles were smothered.
Hildebrand gobbled three hard
chances out in left field and responded
with three of the Angels' five hit-?.
His catch of Sheehan's liner with
Doyle on third base in the i.ixth
round prevented the Tigers from
breaking up the game then and ther-i.
Joe Corbett will pitch for the Ti
gers against Oscar Jones of Brooklyn
this afternoon. Jones used to be a
big favorite when he was an Angel

doubtless be glad to see him perform

BY FRED E. MULHOLJjAND.
The large Saturday crowd at Oakland
track was treated to a pretty finish in
the handicap, Frank Skinner's useful
mud horse, Bombardier, snatching vic
tory from Gateway by a scant nose at
the wire. :_r"
There were only five starters, but
.they furnished an excellent betting
proposition, and quite a contest. Be
cause Tie took the handicap on Wednes
day, Arcade, carrying 108 pounds, was
installed favorite at odds of 6 to 5. An
early plunge on Elliott, the top weight,
forced the odds against the Daly horse
down to 2, but after he warmed up
lame, the price lengthened out again.
Gateway and Bombardier had hosts
of friends, while Veterano attractsd
few admirers, it being his first trip to
the barrier.. Dominick, on Elliott, cut
out the running almost to the far turn,
where he faltered and was passed by
Gateway and Bombardier. The former
led into the stretch by a narrow mar
gin, with "Big Bill" Knapp sighting
him. on the raii.
MICHAELS' STRONG FINISH.
Michaels now began to work "on Bom
bardier, and the pair had it nip and
tuck, Michaels a bit the stronger fin
isher, possibly, landing his motfnt by a
couple of inches. Arcade at no period
looked .dangerous, Elliott securing
show honors without a struggle. '
Despite the fact that the track was
in heavy condition, the horses ran re
markably well to form. Purses were
captured by four favorites, while Isa
bellita enlivened matters by romping
home in -the last race at odds of 12
tol.
None of the other starters in the
introductory number possessed speed
enough to carry Pickaway, and it, was
simply a gallon for the chestnut sprint
er. Played from evens to 7 to ,10, he
won by three lengths from Garnet Fer
guson's Stilicho, the second choice. Cor
oner Kelly, a 30 to 1" chance, disposed
of Instrument for the show. The Lieu
tenant failed to run up to expectations.;
"Big Bill" Knapp,. who rode: The
Lieutenant, met with â  more; success on
his next mount. He piloted , Mifnb,* the
post favorite in the six ; and ' a \half fur
long selling, run, and showed jthe: way
from start to finish;; Alice' Careyr the
well-supported third : choiCe,^.' tired: per
ceptibly the last eighth of a mile," losing
the show " to": Foxy.-* Grandpa: Langford
James proved much of a false alarm.
PLATT SCORES HANDILY.
There was no mistake V about the
chestnut colt Platt, from the., stable 'of
F; H. Stevens & Son; being a legitimate
favorite ' for the ' Futurity course spin,'
following.' Ridden by Davis and a trifle
slow beginning,"" the' youngster .was ; go
ing away'at ; the end ; from ' DIxelle, a 30
to ; 1: shot. v / Edrpdun, " the early ; pace
maker, finished ': third, in front of -Bose
Eley. _ â '.' ; ..
On past ; form Ripper â  looked a - ; cer-
tainty for the seven-furlong selling run.
and I he scored with ridiculous ease.
While Bronze Wing and Hipponax were
both well supported, the price about
Ripper gradually dropped from 8 to 5 to
6 to 5., This was. a long quotation, for
the gelding, with Micky McLaughlin in
the saddle, early assumed the lead and
blew in. seven lengths ahead of Bronze
Wing. Hipponax finished a moderate
third.
Taking her last two races for illustra
tion, Isabellita gave conclusive proof
that a heavy and not a sloppy track is
her forte. Ridden by "Big Bill" Knapp
in the concluding race of the day and 12
to 1 in the betting, the mare passed
Colonel Van when ready and galloped
in first. Dungannon closed strong, tak
ing the place from Colonel Van. Bab,
the 9 to 20 % favorite, ridden by Davis,
was messed about at the first turn and
at-no stage was a factor in the race.

ally quick, and seldom lets his oppo
nent get the advantage of him. All
during the preliminary season he
would -get 'through the line on kicks
and down the runner in the back field.
His work in the line this year in the
California game was largely responsi
ble for the success of the tackle plays
that brought Stanford a decisive vip
tory. A fact that will, make next
year's game interesting is that Captain
Sprott will oppose Force, recently
elected captain of the eleven at
Berkeley.

day on 'the latter's home grounds by
the score of 6 to 5. The mutes weighed
only 135 pounds, against an average
of 160 for Lick, and surprised the lat
ter by the swift, plucky game they
played. The institute team scored in
the first half, when Baker's thirty
yard run, to within a foot of the Lick
goal line, was followed by a touch
down. Evans failed to kick a goal.
Lick's weight told in the second

KOKEA OFF FOR ORIENT
TheOoddental and Oriental Steamship
Company's liner Gaelic, Captain Finch,
which, for twenty years has been pass-
Ing In and out of the Golden Gate, an
chored In quarantine Friday night,
probably for the last time. After dis
charging her cargo she will make one
more trip to the Orient and from there
return to Liverpoolâ back to the fold of
the White Star line.
The Gaelic -was released from quaran
tine early yesterday morning. She
brought from the Orient only seven
passer gers, but In her hold she carried
a valuable cargo. The freight Included
1451 bales of raw Bilk, valued at more
than 51,000,000.' She brought a small
shipment of tea and treasure, valued at
531,000. She had 2600 tons of cargo al
together;
She brought one passenger from Hon
olulu, H. T. Trowbridge, a chemist, em
ployed on one of the sugar plantations.
The Gaelic being a foreign ship, is not
allowed to carry passengers between
American ports except upon payment
of a fine. Trowbridge's business, how
ever, was of more importance than
5200, the amount he had to pay in addi
tion to his fare for the privilege of
traveling under an alien flag. The other
passengers on the Gaelic were Captain
A. G. Bollman. W. C. Kruegel, T. S.
Pugh, Charles Bryan, H. Mason and
Chin Yee.
The Gaelic has been out here for
twenty years. Eight years ago the pilot
ran her ashore in the Inland Sea and
she missed one trip repairing the in
juries there sustained. With this ex
ception she has had a clear record. She
has never had another accident, and
riutside of this has never been laid up a
week for repairs. Her officers declare
that she is as good a boat as the Gaelic
that came here a score of years ago.
During the twenty years she has had
only two commanders. Captain Pearne,
who died of a broken heart it Is said
poon after his vessel went ashore in the
Inland Sea. Pearne was exonerated of
all blame, but it was the first accident
in a long career and he never got over
it. Captain Finch succeeded Captain
Pearne. Finch has many friends ashore,
and if the going away of the Gaelic
means the departure of Finch there
trill be additional cause to regret the
Gaelic's recall to British waters.
Korea Sails for the Far East
The Pacific Mail Company's liner Ko
rea, Captain TV. B. Seabury, sailed yes
terday for Honolulu and the Far East.
She carried more than Â£000 tons of
freight and her cabins and steerage
were crowded with parsengers. Three
hundred Chinese took passage on the
hig steamship, and on the Pacific Mail
wharf 3000 Orientals gathered to bid
ihtir countrymen good-by. Among the
departing Celestials was a woman â a
slave rescued by missionaries from one
of the dens in Chinatown. As the
emancipated bond woman climbed the
Korea's gangplank a dozen yellow
hands grabbed her. and only the inter
ference cf dock officials and a Chinese
Eureau guard enabled the woman to
reach the steamer's deck. For half an
hour after she had disappeared down
the steerage compar.ionway the great
est excitement prevailed among the as
sembled Chinese, who threatened venge
ance on everybody, from A. H. Harri
man. on whose steamer the girl had
found refuse, to the humble guard
whose interference had helped to save
her from the violence of the mob.
Among the Korea's passengers were
many prominent Japanese returning to
the island kingdom from St. Louis.
She carried cabin passengers as fol

CC'.i KEARNY ST.
He Is no Imitator. Hi? work Is upon origi-
nal Unes: Pure thought, clear visions. He
te'ls you what you desire to know and wor_?
In the cpen light.
He is as consricuoas for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original expres-
sion and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading is not a life reading; when
you call on PP.OF. LIVINGSTONE be will
y;vy you a full life reading for $1; a test is of
iittSe value; when the mind Is troubled you
need more substantial aid and advice; this is
Jast what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives you
when you call oa him. for a first-class clair-
voyant reading.
He asks you no questiona, but tells you
what you wish to know.
â¢ Would It not be a relief to know bow you
â¢ will succeed, to be relieved of the matters
.that are troubling you. and cf the schemes of
your enemieÂ«. that you may meet with better
success?
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to; you are acquainted
with the facts In your case; let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you find the cause of the trouble
ar.d sugpest tha remedy.
. His only reason for giving your name In
full or any important information you may
desire Is that he does this Incidentally as a
chain to read by.
THEN FOR A RELIABLE AND INTEL-
.LIGENT CLAIRVOYANT READING DON'T
HESITATE. HUT CONSULT A MAN WITH
THIRTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE AND
â¢ -WHEN YOU LEAVE HIM YOU MAY BE
ASSURED' THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
HELPED AND THOROUGHLY UNDER-
BTAND WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD YOU.
WHICH TOO OFTEN IS NOT THE CAPE.
He claims to be able, and positively re-
fuses to accept one ppnny unless you are
, ' perfectly satisfied; and further, he never
flights any ose In his work â all are the same
' to him. and he believes such is the verdict
of all who consult him.

3IAN ON MURDER BENT
IS SHOT BY CONSTABLE
Attempts to Kill Officer With a Gun
and Js Himself Fatally
Wounded.
WOODLAND, Deo. 3. â Louis Chyte,
an old resident of this city, was shot
to-night by Constable Parker, who, it
is said, acted in self-defense. There
is no hope for Chyte's recovery.
Chyte was lying in wait for George
Kinkle, an old enemy, at the tatter's
house, but had been seen by Kinkle,
who thought him a burglar. Kinkle
reported the matter to the officers and
they went after the supposed thief.
Constable Parker says that when he
approached the house he stood near
the fence surveying the scene. Hear
ing a noise in the yard he directed
Griffin's attention to It and the latter
flashed his lantern.
Parker could just discern the form
of a man in a crouching position with
a black mask concealing the lower
part of his face. The man raised a
shotgun and fired and Parker replied
with his revolver. One of the buck
shot from the gun tore a hole through
the top of Parker's hat. Parker fell,
but regaining his feet crossed the
street to await developments. In the
meantime other officers arrived and
the premises were searched. Chyte
was found in some bushes near the
house with a bullet wound In his head.
Chyte has had much trouble with
Kinkle over some city property and
bad blood had existed between them
for years. Parker has given himself
up to the Sheriff.

LIFE DIPLOMAS
FOR TEACHERS
State Board of Education
Meets at Sacramento and
Talks on School Affairs
TEXTBOOK DISCUSSION
Publishers Are Warned Not
to Attempt to Influence
the Judgment of Headers
Ereclal Dfepatcb to The CalL
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 8.â A meeting
of the State Board of Education was
held to-day at the Capitol. Benjamin
Ide Wheeler of the UnlverBlty of Ber
keley presided. Besides Professor
Wheeler, the members of the board
present were Samuel T. Black, Fred L.
Burk, J. F. Mlllspaugh, M. E. Dailey,
C. C. Van Liew and State Superintend
ent of Public Instruction T. J. Kirk.
One of the first matters considered by
the board was the action of the Butte
County Board of Education and the
Board of Trustees of the Chico High
School in filing charges against George
R. Ray, who was a teacher in the High
School at Chlco. His accusers were
boys who attended the High School.
Ray, rather than stand an investiga
tion by the trustees of the school, left
Chico. He returned his diploma to the
State Board of Education and wrote to
that body that he would not attempt
to teach school again. A committee
composed of Benjamin Ide Wheeler, J.
F. Mlllspaugh and C. C. Van Liew re
ported that Ray had practically admit
ted the truthfulness of the charges and
recommended that his certificate be re
voked. The report was adopted.
KIRK MAKES STATEMENT.
Superintendent Kirk submitted a let
ter to the board in which he asked to
be set right in the eyes of the public
It was to the effect that Principal Fred
I* Burk of the San Francisco High
School had quoted a man in that city
as saying that after every meeting oi
the State text book committee Kirk
would call up the oflice of the American
Book Company in San Francisco by
telephone and give a detailed "account
of what business had been transacted.
When the letter was read Principal
Burk said his informant had been S. C.
Smith of the firm of Ginn & Co., school
book publishers. He said that Smith
had remarked to him that Kirk was
getting too friendly with the American
Book Company.
Smith was present at the meeting of
the board to-day and he said: "I
would be a fool if I did not try to find
out whether a rival firm was trying to
get private or inside information about
the publication of school books." '
Professor Burk of the San Francisco
Normal School said tlu re should be
free publicity of the names of the read
ers of school text books offered to the
board and publishers of books should
not encroach upon the time of these
readers to Induce them to recommend
any particular book.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler said
that the board, had provided that pub
lishers of school books should not con
sult with members about textbooks
an dthat the rule should be enforced.
Professor Burk offered a resolution
to the effect that all business discus
sions between the State Board of Edu
cation, committees or members and
publishers of books should be in open
meeting, and any attempt on the part
of a company to discuss business with
individuals, or with readers, or to com
promise a member of the board in any
way to effect his Judgment will be suf
ficient ground for rejecting any of such
company's books presented for consid
eration.
Professor Burk's resolution was
adopted. * . â¢

FINISH TWO TOURNAMENTS
Get! and Jjertnson Take the IXraJbles
and Mclxjughlln Carried Off
Honors In Singles.
The Juvenile players Â©f the Golden
Gate Tennis Club finished two tourna
ments . yesterday. Both were started
last week. In the morning Harold
Gets and Louis Levlnson carried off
the honors in the handicap doubles
tournament. _ In the afternoon M. Mo-
Loughlin won the scratch singles
event and proved the cleverest player
in the club. This event was for a
three-time silver loving cup. Mc-
Loughlih won , the last tournament of
this kind, but the cup was not up at
the time.
In the.semi-flnals McLoughlin beat
H. Corbley easily. The latter won only
one game in two sets. In the finals
McLoughlin had an easy time again.
His opponent was^Harold Getz. The
score was 6-1, 7-5r
The final match of the handicap
doubles was exceedingly close. M.
McLoughlin and A. Martinez, playing
from "SO" back of scratch, were
beaten by H. Getz and L. Levlnson,
who were "15" behind scratch. Mc-
Loughlin and Martinez won the first
set, 6-4. The second was close and
went to Getz and Levinson by a 7-5
score. The scratch men lost heart in
the third set, which went rather easily
to Getz and McLoughlin- The score
was 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
The fourth class players win finish
their tournament on the park courts
to-day.
The attendance at the California
Club courts was rather light for a Sat
urday afternoon. Few of the best
players put in an appearance and the
lGwer class men had the courts to
themselves. George Janes and Her
bert Long and Carl Gardner and Mel
viile Long^ furnished the best match,
although it was too one-sided to be
interesting. Young Long and Gard
ner did not couple up well and won
only two games in two sets from their
opponents.
. In singles Merle Johnson and Paul
Jones played two close sets. Jones lost
both by 6-4 scores, but made a good
showing against- his first-class oppo
nent. Gus Lisser was in good form
when he beat M. Little, 7-5. George
Cutter won two sets from W. G.
Knowlton, the first of which was close.
The score was 7-5, 6-2. Little beat R.
B. Daggett by a similar score. Graun
ger tied Wallace, the score being
6-3, 4-6.
The continuous tournament will be
commenced on the California Club
courts to-day. All of the active mem
bers have entered their names and will
draw for places this morning.

Baker & Hamilton Eleven Pluckily
Holds Down Husky Paciiic Boys
at Presidio.
Baker & Hamilton's football team
fought an eleven from the Pacific
Hardware Company to n. standstill
yesterday at the Presidio athletic
grounds. The Baker outfit was bucked
down the field twice by their husky
opopne. ..-. but just at the time it
looked like curtains they held the Pa
cific bunch andjj kicked into safety.
The exciting moment was In the sec
ond half. .The Pacifies, bucked to
within a yard of Bakers' goal.
Right there the Baker & Hamilton
line turned into a brick wall. Three
desperate plunges by the Pacifies'
backs could not gain an inch. The
Pacific Hardware team holds the
championship of 1903.

Boxer Marvin Hart Is Here.
Marvin Hart. the heavyweight
fighter, reached this city last night ac
companied by his manager, Jack Me-
Cormack. Hart is looking for trouble
and will surely be accommodated, as
both Kid McCoy and Jack Johnson
are said to be willing to fight him. A
match with Johnson in January would
be an attractive one.
Jim Morley of Los Angeles repre
sents McCoy and expresses himself as
ready to make a match. Hart is here
on his own account and has offered
his services to the San Francisco Ath
letic Club for next month.

v'-f.erdaj- eaid:
It la ceecUecs to cay that the Government
estimate of 12.162.000 b&les is sÂ» large that
:t has iSLZti . the trade. No detailed figures
will be given out tO' the Agricultural Bureau
o to how it arrived at auch aa estimate until
:â .:?;-. iÂ£v. The estlsaate of tbe bureau to-day,
fccwever. must be accected at its full value,
erpeeiai'.y aa It hat never been known to err
la over-estimating the crcp. We caa only say
that ri have been wrong, both in the market
p-.z thÂ» cr â¢;> the last month, but like tr.aiy
ethers cf locg experience we did not believe
tbe South could produce a crop of more than
eleven irl a half million bales, especially
!a view cf the reported extensive damage by
tne boll weevil in Texaa r_ii the ccntinued
referenoe rsaSe in evtrj- cne of the weekly
Oovercsieiit repcrts an3 weather bulletins
througa the mortta of September and October
to the fact that there was little or so top
crop.
Considering the Liverpool cables cur mar
ket epeaea tetter than expected. It was
rtr.oui durisg the entire session and en an
nouncement of the Government crop estimate,
which was a great surprise to the entire
trade, tlie market broke some fifty points.
Tfce coettica that the trade 'will now have
to flecifle la what this crop is worth. The
ccEjrjniptioa of cotton at present prices will
n--> fioubt be the larrest ca record, while the
crop is eiÂ»o the largest. Next to be considered
is tbe future crop. The market closed barely
eteady at about the lowest of the day.

CHICAGO BOARD OP TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. 8. â Among the factors that
created strength abroad were indications of a
decrease In world's shipments, and the wheat
market opened firm with May up Hglic and
**c and $1 10\Â«il 10% and $1 11. France was
asserted to be on an importing basis and'
was reported as having recently been a buyer
of Indian and Australian cargoes. A more im
portant influence was a statement that all of
fers of Argentine wheat for January and Feb
ruary ahipments had been withdrawn. For
the moment, however, tbe domestic situation
appeared rather less bullish, snow having
fallen In some sections of the winter wheat
country- Receipts in thÂ« Northwest also were
somewhat larger than last week. In conse
quence many traders were Inclined to ignore
foreign conditions and were quite liberal sell
ers early. The result was a reaction in
prices. May declining to $1 10%. But the
weakness was only temporary, a rally quickly
occurring as soon as selling pressure subsided.
The predominating tone of advices from the
Southwest to-day waÂ« decidedly In favor of
the bulls. The anxiety regarding the winter
wheat crop was increased by the Ohio report,
which made the condition of growing wheat In
that State 75, a loss of 12 points within a
month. This showing was quite enough to
create considerable apprehension regarding the
general effect of the prevailing dry weather.
Throughout the last half of the session senti

The. recent depression In ' Butter has now
pretty well passed away. Stocks, though still
ample for all needs, are no longer burdensome,
and some - houses rejKJrt that buyers, finding
that they can get fresh creameries about as
cheap as storage goods, ' are coming - back to
them again. Prices remain the same, but the
feeling -is rather steadier. â " r - -r

ually Increasing . and sellers are willing to
meet buyers, even at concessions. Quotations,
ho"wever, remain unchanged.

prices, but quotations for^ other fruits were
unchanged. Stocks of Apples were Increased
