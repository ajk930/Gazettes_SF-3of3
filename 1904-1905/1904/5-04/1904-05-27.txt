ports that unless some blighting influ

TACOMA, May 26.â William Hansen of San
Francisco, chief owner of the Tacoma Mill
Company, who is here, says that lumbermen
must quickly arrange some kind of combina
tion to control both the prices of lumber and
logs It there is to be any material improve
ment in market conditions. He finds the
present status of the lumber trade unsatis
factory. His mills are runuins at only about
half their capacity and the bij? St. Paul mills
here are not operating atnlcht.
Hansen contemplates closing down entirely
for sixty days and will decide the matter this
week. He declares that sales are not light,
but. that lumbermen cannot afford to pay so
much for loss and sell lumber at present
prices. Logs on Grays Harbor and the Colum
bia River are costing $1 less than on Puget
Sound.

"I first got acquainted with the girl,"
said the doctor, ""ythree years a^o,
when I was called to attend her in my
capacity as a physician. She was then
very ill with the grip. She told me that
she was a music teacher, but she ap
peared to be poor, and I had a great
deal of sympathy for her. After she
got better she continued to call at my
"After a time she told me that she
was in trouble and asked me to help
her. Finally, with the aid of a prom
inent woman here in the city, we man
aged to send the girl away to New
Jersey, where her shame would be
known only to strangers. It was then
that I received the first intimation of
the dastardly plot that they intended
to work on me. I always addressed
her as 'My dear girl,' but that is the
way I always address my friends. I
received a letter from her stating that
if I did not immediately pay her $5000
she would expose me and declare me
the father of her child. At that time
my wife was seriously ill, and I feared
for her in case there was any trouble.
I finally gave her the money.
"The next time I heard from her she
made another demand for $5000 and I
refused her. Then she started for
Butte and said that she was going to
take a room in a hotel here and kill
the child and herself and leave a note
connecting me with the affair. At that
time my wife was at the point oi
death and I was nearly distracted. I
agreed to give her the $5000 if she
would sign an agreement to release me
from all claims in the future. She
signed the agreement and I gave her
the money, but a short time I ago 1
received a communication from her
lawyer demanding $15,000 from me on
her behalf."
BUTTE, Mont., May 2b'.â With a de
termination to clear a name that has
been unsullied. Dr. O. B. Whitford left
Butte this afternoon for Los Angeles,
where he will prosecute Bessie Dris
eoll, a former Butte girl, for black
mail. For years he has suffered from
the persecutions of the girl, he de
clares, and now, despite the notoriety
he is gaining, he will publicly appear
in court against her.
According to Whitford, the trouble
began after he had effected the sale
of a half-million dollars' worth of min;
ing property to an Eastern company,
Bessie Driseoll, a well-known woman
in Butte, and a mysterious man con
spiring to get hold of some of his
wealth. Dr. Whitford characterizes
the acts of the girl as the basest in
gratitude.
Bpc?ial Dispatch to The Call
TUCSON, Ariz., May 26.â The town
of Nogales^ on the international line,
was the scene of a brutal murder to
day, and a mob from the Mexican side
might have dealt with the perpetrator
of the deed severely but for the timely
interference of M. Mascarenas, the
Mexican Consul. .
Arturo Castelan, whose father is the
Federal Judge of Nogales, Sonora, was
shot dead by Joseph Larkin while he
and a number of boys were stealing
green fruit from the orchard of Cap
tain Noon, chairman of the Santa Cruz
County Supervisors. Larkin was guard
ing the orchard and opened -fire on the
boys, three bullets from his rifle pass
ing through the body of young Caste
lan. Captain Noon, who heard the
shots, rushed to the scene and covered
Larkin with a six-shooter until the of
ficers could be summoned.
Larkin was thrown in jail on the
American side, and the Coroner would
have held an inquest but for the pro
test of the Mexican Consul, who wants
to summon additional evidence that the
deed may be firmly fixed upon Larkin.
He will ask that the man be given a
speedy trial, as the Mexicans >. are ac
customed to dealing out swift justice
in cases of this kind, and the friends of
Castelan are very bitter.

sistant secretaries of the various so
cieties. In several cases the first bal
lot failed to show an ejection and a sec
ond one was taken, the restflt of which

yet known.
LOS ANGELES, May 26.â The most
impressive ceremony in tlie Methodist

Bishops ever consecrated at any one
time in the history of the church. In
fact, but a total of fifteen new Method

the past quarter of a century. The
largest number consecrated on any
previous single occasion was at
Brooklyn in 1872, when seven were

PORTLAND, Or., May 26.â On a war
rant sworn to by United States District
Attorney John H. Hall. Lee M. Travis,
a prominent "young Eugene attorney,
was arrested this afternoon charged
with pension frauds. That Travis is a
Philippine veteran and has recently
made application to the pension bureau
on his own behalf adds to the interest
taken in his arrest. "When arrested' this
afternoon by Deputy United States
Marshal Proebstel, Travis said:
"I am greatly surprised at my arrest
and cannot account for it. I have been
instrumental in securing several pen-i
sions recently, and also applied for a
pension for myself on account of Phil
ippine war service, but everything has
been absolutely regular." .
The charge against Travis is similar
to that preferred against T. A. Wood
and Hosea Wood in the indictment re
turned against them by the last Fed
eral Grand Jury, but it differs in one
respect â Travis must answer to the
charge of "transmitting to the Commis
sioner of Pensions false and forged
writings and affidavits, knowing the
same to be false and forged, in support
of a pension claim for himself."

o7 cannot collect or form so
nuickly at this end. the polar-
Uy may be diverted by inhibiting the
current. This, inhibition may be ac
complished very simply by fastening a
ligature around the middle of the stem.
In one experiment Dr. Loeb used
twenty-eight* animals, the polyps and
roots of which were cut off. all the
pieces .being approximately equal in
length. Fourteen of the pieces were
Â¦tied In the middle by a fine silk thread.
The remaining fourteen served, as a
control. On the second day all the lig
ated ends formed oral polyps and
thirteen aboral polyps. The unligated
stems formed thirteen polyps and no
polyps at the aboral Â«nd.
Results going to prove the Investi
gator's theories were obtained in other
ways, and of these he says: "If we
correlate all these observations, we
get the idea that the cause of the nor
mal polarity which appears- in the re
generation of a piece cut from the
stem of a tubularian is based on the
condition that the circulation favor3
the motion of various substances in
the direction from the aboral to the
oral pole."
In conclusion Dr. Loeb finds that the
experiments show that the polarity ob
served in the regeneration of the ani
mal is not to be "referred to a mor
phological polarity of the individual
cells, but to a process which is com
parable as to its variety with a pro
cess of streaming In the direction of
the aboral to the oral- pole. The re
sults suggested the idea that a liga
ture placed around the middle of the
stem must abolish polarity, an idea
that was tested arid found, to -be true.

: Clever Young Thespians at
Santa Clara College Pre
sent an Entertaining Play
eptclMl Dispatch to The Call
SANTA CLARA, May 26.â As many
"rjeopl<? &b could be seated in the College
. Theater this evening witnessed the
.Rev. D. J. Kavar.augh's five-act his
torical play, '"Henry Garnet, 8. J.,
â¢Martyr," staged by Martin V. Merle
â¢and "-aoted by the Senior Dramatic
Â«."lub. The audience was composed al
ynost exclusively of admirers of the
author and well-wishers of the play
t and its Judgment of the perform
ance was manifestly ir.flu<?nced by pre-
dilection. but any impartial and intelli
gent critic, after making allowance for
the fact that the play was written by
an ecclesiastic and presented by ama
teurs, would have pronounced it a re
markably interesting entertainment.
While the play was evidently writ
ten with disregard of the estabiished
playwriting conventions, it introduced
fcome dramatic effects that would not
be unworthy of the great Mr. Belasco
himself, and the acting was punctuat
ed with occasional bursts of histrionic
merit that even the great Mr. Mans
field could graciously condescend to
envy. To convey a hint of how utter
ly Father Kavanaugh ignored the tra
ditional it is only needful to say that
his work is entirely destitute of com
edy and does not present one feminine
character. What secular caterer to
theatric taste dare produce a drama
unbrokenly serious of sentiment and
barren of femininity in its cast?
The play treats of the part taken
in the famous "gunpowder plot" by
Henry Garnet, Jesuit, who was exe
cuted for his participation, and the
character is drawn as a man whose
loyalty to God was greater than his
loyalty to any temporal powerâ who
deplored the wicked deeds of those
British revolutionists who, claiming al
legiance to Rome, brought disgrace
upon her true ministers. His i3 the
most distinct personality in a play
that has a paucity of striking con
trasts in characterization as a con
spicuous structural defect. Even Guy
Fawkes falls short of fulfilling the
ideal of individual recklessness that
v>as denoted by his attempt to blow
up a Parliament.
And all the other prominent person
ages are too much alike in tempera
ment and method of expression â too
prone to uncalled-for loftiness of
declamation, too neglectful of the
little things â the minutiae of detail â
that are essential to realism. The
play's historical correctness precludes
congruous maintenance of the element
of suspense that is also necessary to
offectiveness, but the climaxes are co^
herently prefaced and logically
capped.
â¢Some of the stage pictures are in
tensely melodramatic, so much so as to
imperil the religious atmosphere cre
ated by the preceding precepts and ac
tion. Ona sceneâ a sword duel in the
dim light of lanterns held by the com
batantsâis as fine a bit of stage effect
as ever was conceived. The execution
Ff-ene in the last act is also managed
with an impresslveness that Mr. Irving,
master of stagecraft never excelled.
But perhaps the greatest tribute
that can be paid to the author is con
tained fu the single statement that ho
builded without following any man's
plan. His play would not be accept
ed by any regular manager, but then
it was not written for the market, and
it accomplishes its purpose of reli
gious teaching better -than any recog
nized dramatist could accomplish it
After witnessing it one cannot help
feeling that it rights a wrong that for
400 years has been attached to the
character of Henry Garnet, S. J.

Four hundred women broke through
the gates to the Midway when the
train arrived bringing Miss Roosevelt.
Miss Alice "Ward of Washington and
several maids. The women crowded
about Miss Roosevelt at the train
Eteps, delaying her advance in spite of
the protection given by two policemen
who led the party. Miss Irene Cat
lln, whose guest Miss Roosevelt is, and
her brother, Treator Catlin, had great
difficulty in keeping near the party.
When the Midway was passed Miss
Roosevelt and her escorts broke Into
a rapid walk, while the crowd follow
ed with shouts of "Hurrah for Miss
Roosevelt!" and "There she is!" un
til the carriage was reached at the en
trance of the station. So great was
the rush at the carriage that the
President's daughter was almost forced
against the wheels before she could
enter. As soon as she was seated the
carriage was driven rapidly away.
The feature of to-day's programme
was the dedication of the Texas State
pavilion. The building is unique. It
is constructed in the form of a five
pointed star and is one of the most
elaborately finished and decorated of
the State pavilions.
ST. LOUIS, May 26.â A crowd of
5000 persons, more than three-fourths
of whom were women, jostled each
other for a glimpse of Miss Alice
Roosevelt in Union station this after
noon when shÂ« arrived for a week's
visit.
Dr. Loeb also demonstrated to his
satisfaction that by inhibiting the
polyp formation at the oral end of
the animal it is possible to accelerate
the polyp formation at the aboral end.
Upon this point he says that if the
phenomenon of polarity depends on a
current, by means of which the polyp
forming materials are carried
"I found further that at the end at
which a new polyp forms the formation
of this organ may be. recognized from
the fact that red pigment granules
collect at this end in relatively great
density. New pigment granules are
transported by a current of fluid to
this end and evidently remain lying
or stuck in the neighborhood of the
cut surface. The stream of fluid is
kept up by ciliary movement. I am of
the opinion that such a transportation
of materials by the stream of fluid to
ward the cut end is one of the con
ditions of the formation of the organs
in the animal, and that the polarity
of that stem â that is, 'the fact that the
polyp forms earlier at the oral pole â
depends on the fact that the organ
forming substances, possibly the red
pigment granules, collect in sufficient
quantity sooner at the oral than at
the aboral end. This assumption Is
based on a series of experiments that
I made."
By morphological polarity Dr. Loeb
explains that he means the fact that
a piece cut off from the organism at
that end which in the uninjured ani
mal was directed toward the oral pole,
or head, again forms an oral pole,
while at the opposite cut end a root,
or aboral pole, is formed. If, for ex
ample, a "square piece is cut from the
body of an actinian, whose body is
comparable with a hollow cylinder, and
if one side of the square is parallel to
the long axis of the animal, new tenta
cles arise only, at that side of. .the
square which was "directed toward the
former oral pole of the animal.
In carrying out his experiments Dr.
Loeb used an animal, the hydroid, in
which could easily be observed the mi
gration of material which was asso
ciated with the formation of Its or
gans. This animal consists of a long,
tubular nnbranched stem, a root,
usually branched, and a polyp, or
bead. Th2 outer surface of the stem
is surrounded by a hard material, and
the living cells lie inside this tube.
Dr. Loeb found that if a piece be
cut from the body of the animal there
always appeared a new polyp and
never a root at the oral cut end. This
new growth began at a sufficiently
high temperature in two or three days.
At the aboral, or root end of the seg
ment there was formed sometimes a
new root and sometimes a polyp. If
a polyp forms at the aboral end it
arises much more slowlyâ often a week
later than the polyp at the oral or
head end. If a piece is cut from the
stem of the animal it can generally be
told with certainty from the phe
nomena of regeneration which was the
oral cut end. Continuing with his nar
rative. Dr. Loeb says:
FORMATION' OF ORGANS.
LOEB'S EXPLANATION.
The value of Dr. Loeb's experiments
lies in his success in proving with ani
mal bodies the theories that other
scientists had advanced after experi
ments with plant life. In the eight
eenth century two investigators, Du
Hamel and Bonnet, arrived at the con
clusion that certain sap currents are
responsible for the fact that in plants
at one end of a piece cut off from a
branch an apex arises and at the other
end root is formed. Du Hamel as
sumed that a specific sap causes the
formation of roots and that this sap
moves basalward in the stem of the
plant, while the fluids which give rise
to the formation of branches move up
ward.
Dr. Loeb took his cue from the re
sults obtained by the investigations of
these and other scientists. The idea
that sap currents and the collecting
of materials form the cause ( of re
generation and organ formation sug
gested to him a fruitful field for re
search. It was the general belief of
scientific men then that tho individual
cells in the animal body are polarized
and that therefore there is produced at
the basal end organs different from
those at the oral end. But the experi
ments with the plants led Dr. Loeb to
believe that the same conditions ob
tained in animal life as in plant life,
and so he pursued his investigations to
prove the morphological polarity of
the animal body.
Professor Jacques Loeb, the biolo
gist, has succeeded through a series of
experiments he has just made at the
University of California in confirm
ing theories he has long held that the
polarity observed in the regeneration
of the animal body does not exist in
the cells, but in the streaming of re
generating processes of the body,
moving from the basal to the oral
pole. In the bulletin bearing the title,
"Concerning Dynamic Conditions
Which Contribute Toward the De
termination of the Morphological
Polarity of Organisms," which was is
sued at the university to-day. Dr. Loeb
gives the results of his experiments.

When a citizen right hero at homo

the most skeptical doubter must be con-
vinced. It's pretty hard for our readers
to prove a statement made by a stranger
living In some far-away .point of thÂ»
Union, but the endorsement of neigh-
bors, friends and citizens is the best of
proof: no better evidence can be .had.

Can women be bohemians?
Just ask any one of the sixty hus
bands who were escorted by their wives
to the Papyrus Club jinks last night.
They can tell you all about how the
women threw aside their glad gowns â
their dignity with themâ for the .togs
of German peasants, sat around tables
in German fashion, permitted the men
to smoke right out in, meetinV-only
they- didn't furnish" the cigars, the
omission being ascribed by Mrs. C. Ma
son Kinne, the president, to. the men's
finicky tastes in smokes. At this the
men smiled.
At every table were steins â not emp
ty steins, either â pretzels, pickles, sand
wiches, coffee and other delicacies dea:
to the Dutchman's heart. And aroum
the tables sat the guests in jolly fash
ion.
But what think you of this? As i:
always the custom in the Papyrus, th<
president, in witty manner, calls upoi
the members ad libitum for stories
Invariably they respond, and in right
clever fashion. Fearing to wound th<
sensibilities of the men by not permit
ting them .to tell a few tales, Mrs
Kinne called upon them. With the sin
gle exception of Mr. Kinne none of th(
men made good. Some of the womer
threatened dire things when their mer
folk sat like Simple Simons, refusing
to tell in public stories to which thes
had been made martyrs by innumerable
tellings, while the men In their defens<
declared that Mr. Kinne had an undue
advantage of them because his wift
had given him* a tip beforehand, anc
therefore he knew what to say. At anj
rate the men, who were surely shamec
into . silence by the cleverness of th<
women's stories, had good fun. In fact
one of them, having found his voice
had the temerity to rise and make e
motion to the effect that the men bt
invited every three months, with thÂ«
same supply of beer, pretzels anc
youthful jokes.

DENVER. May 28.â Committees represent

United Mine Workers of America and thft
American Federation of J,abor appointed to
confer on the question of a union of the three
organizations, began their deliberations this
afternoon. It is believed an amalgamation will
be effected.
Three Great Labor Organizations Are
Likely to Re Merged.
AMALGAMATION IS FAVORED.
The Tokio correspondent of the Daily
Chronicle, under date of May 26, sends
the following:
"The Japanese have already con
structed thirty miles of light railroad
for the transportation of the siege guns
toward Port Arthur. Around Kinchou
the Japanese have been fighting for the
past eight days, but are making little
progress against the Russians, who oc
cupy strong positions on the heights."
ST. PETERSBURG, May 26.â The
general staff is not in a position to
night to confirm or deny the Tokio re
port that the Japanese have occupied
Kinchou. The latest official information
regarding fighting in that vicinity was
conveyed in Lieutenant General Sak
haroff's telegram, which said that the
Japanese had lost 700 men on May 18.
It would be a great surprise to the
authorities here if the report of the
capture of Kinchou should prove to be
true. If the Japanese rushed Kinchou
by a frontal attack the capture of the
place must have been effected at a tre
mendous loss to the attacking party.
Russians retired in good order to the
heights farther south, which were at
tacked by the full Japanese force and
carried after a stubborn resistance.
The Japanese attacked Nanquanling,
on the narrowest part of^ the Kwan
tung Peninsula, yesterday and drove
back the Russians by main force. The
attack on Kinchou was begun at dawn
to-day and by noon Kinchou was in the
hands of the Japanese, who occupied
the castle. The fighting continued dur
ing the afternoon and was of the most
desperate character. It is believed the
casualties were heavy.
"One of our eotniag encountered a
Japanese detachment on the night of
May 20-21 at Sitkouchintse and caused'
great consternation among the Japa
nese, who opened a wild fire against
the Cossacks. In the darkness they
fired upon their own men.
"On May 21 a Russian reconnoitering
party got behind the Japanese army
near Tansanchintse, on the main road
from Sakhetlza to Liaoyang, and found
a Japanese detachment S00 strong. The
Russian scouts watched for sixteen
hours, during which time at least 18,000
Chinese and Korean coolies passed, to
gether with 200 carts. The Japanese
finally discovered and attacked the
Russian scouts, all of whose horses
were killed. The scouts were obliged to
return on foot."
"Our cavalry report that the Japa
nese are constructing fortifications
around Fengwangcheng, where they
have a force of 30,000 Infantry- and 2000
cavalry, with thirty-six field guns.
"The Japanese advance guard has ad
vanced to twenty-two miles north of
the Aho River, their front being turned
toward Saimmatse and Kuantlansian.
They are effecting no other movements
north of the Aho River. It Is reported
that a great many Japanese cavalry
horses have beoome exhausted and are
broken down. â¢
"On May 23 our ecouts near Pltzwo
and In the Kwantung Peninsula ascer
tained that Japanese outposts occupied
the heights two miles south of the sta
tion of Wufandian. Three miles in
their rear were two squadrons of cav
alry of the line. Two and a half com
panies of the Twelfth Infantry protect
ed both flanks by Infantry ecreens of
forty men each. Farther southward in
fantry and cavalry were disposed
among the villages bordering on the
railway.
"About Polandien 3000 troops of all
arms and five guns are concentrated.
"In, the neighborhood of Pitzwo and
farther south the Japanese landing
continues, the troops marching thence
toward Kinchou, with covering detach
ments thrown out on the west. â¢
"According to Chinese reports a bat
tle took place at Kinchou on May 18,
in which the Japanese lost 700 men.
The Russian losses were not so great.
"A Japanese landing at Takushan
began five days ago, and it Is reported
that 50,000 troops, principally infantry,
were landed, but this has not yet been
verified. The troops landed are march
ing from Takushan northwest toward
Siuyen and southwest toward Port Ar
thur.
6T. PETERSBURG, May 26.â The gen
eral staff has received the following
telegram, dated May 26, from Lieu
tenant General 8akharoff :
"There Is no change In the general
situation In the Fengwangeheng dis
trict.
It is reported that General Rennen
kampff's Cossacks, who are operating
on the line of General Kuroki's com
munications, have made an important
capture of some of the enemy's guns,
which were being taken forward to
Fengwangeheng. No other details are
given. This report comes from mem
bers of the Emperor's suite.
Although the loss of a Japanese
torpedo-boat on March 10 has not been
admitted by the Japanese, Viceroy
Alexieff positively and ofllcfally affirms
this.
"Between May 18 and May 21 the
Russians cleared eleven of the enemy's
mines from the roadstead.
"The boats of the merchant steam
ship Amur, with a dredger and a steam
launch, have been brought to Port Ar
thur from Dairy."
Viceroy Alexieff telegraphs that a re
port is current that Port Arthur was
bombarded May 24, but says he has not
received any official confirmation of the
rumor.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 27.â The fol
lowing dispatch from Viceroy Alexieff,
dated May 26, has been received by
the Emperor:
"Reports from Rear Admiral Wltt
soeft and Admiral Grigorvotish to-day
state that the enemy bombarded from
Ingetsi Bay (on the west coast
of the Kwangtung Peninsula, about
thirteen miles north, of Port Arthur)
with gunboats. (The Viceroy's dispatch
does not give the date of the bombard
ment.) '
"On the night following the Japanese
attempted to block the roadstead of
Port Arthur with mines, and from
shore observations it is believed that
some steam- launches and two torpedo
boats were sunk.

After conference with party leaders

'many namfs have been referred to him
for his earnest consideration.
Â¦ XO FACTIONAL, DIFFERENCES.
. Reports of factional pressure on the
chairman are' misleading. The Re
publicans of California are not fighting
.among themselves. The opinion is
generally entertained that the State
will give Roosevelt at least 40,000 ma
jority. The desire for the honor of
leading the fight as committee chair
man Is causing some rivalry, but pro
ducing no bitterness. Even the Sena
torial contest Is devoid of rancor and
ill-reeling. Senator Bard and Mr.
Oxnard will each put forth every
honorable effort to bring about the
election of Republican candidates for
the Legislature and the candidate for
the United States Senate who develops
the greatest strength among the legis
laors chosen from the south will prob
ably carry off the prize. It Is stated
positively that the Southern Pac'flc
managers fire taking no part In the
Senatorial contest. LÂ»ater on orders
may be given to members of the Legis
lature who take orders from the cor
poration, but there is an impression
that the Senators and Assemblymen
composing the next Legislature will
consult their constituents, or in other
trorda, take orders from the people.
THIS HEARST SPECIAL.
The contest for chairman of the Re
publican State Central Committee
scorns to have narrowed down to two
candidates, Senator Thomas Flint and
General George Stone. Charles H.

Harbor Commissioners, has no in

committee.

Special Dispatch to The Call
The new structure, which is to cost
$1,000,000, will be twenty stories high,
built of white terra cotta and made
fire-proof. It will be an office building,
but the lower floors are to contain a
theater which will be eigmy feet wide.
An entrance 40 by 60 feet is planned,
and the intention is to make it one of
the most beautiful in the city.
The auditorium has been designed, it
is said, with an eye to beauty, safety,
and complete comfort. Its seating ca
piacity will be 2200.
Permission to remodel the Iroquois
Theater on plans suomitted to the
Building Department has been flatly re
fused by Building Commissioner Wil
liams on an opinion from Corporation
Counsel Tolman. Major Tolman said
the theater would not be allowed to re
open until every provision of the the
ater ordinance had been complied with
and intimated it might be found im
possible to remodel the interior of the
playhouse to conform with the law.
CHICAGO. May 26.â The last steps
necessary for securing the site for the
new theater in Mqnroe street, between
Dearborn and State streets, have been
taken at a meeting of the Board of
Education, when the transfer of the
lease from the Boomer & Gore estates
to Mrs. E. J. Lehmann was approved.
The condition imposed was that a fire
proof building be erected on the prop
erty not later than the end of the year
1905.

XEW YORK, May 26. â Investiga
tion as i to the motive which prompted
David Levy to take his life in the
Equitable building on Wednesday after
failing to negotiate a loan of $450,000,
has led his friends to the conclusion
that the mysterious stranger who fled
after the shooting can alone explain
the act. That this man had some hold
upon Levy and had demanded the im
mediate payment of $30,000 was stated
by one of Levy's friends to-day. In
recalling the incidents which preceded
the suicide, one of the lawyers said:
"There .was a strange man who
called during our business meeting
with Mr. Levy and when the decision
was reached not to advance the loan.
Levy declared that he must have
$30,000 at once. Mr. Levy asked him
to be le'ft alone, as he wanted to think
it over.
"A pistol shot was then heard and
Lawyer Dorthy was the first to enter.
The mysterious stranger followed him.
Seeing Mr. Levy lying on the floor
with a pistol beside him, Dorthy
turned to the stranger and said:
" 'This .is your work!'

Nine others were slightly injured. All

Only three bodies have thus far been
recovered, those of Sherman Shibler,
Patrick White and J. C. Johnson, who
died in a hospital. The bodies of the
other seven victims are thought to be
pinned under the wreckage and may
not be recovered for several days.
Three deckhands reported as missing
and thought to have swelled the num
ber of dead to thirteen were afterward
found in local hospitals!
The Fred Wilson was the property of
the Monogahela River Consolidated
Coal and Coke Companj', and at the
time of the accident was arranging her
tow near Rivervlew Park, about sixty
feet from shore.
No good explanation of the cause of
the accident has been offered. The
most plausible theory is offered by
some of the deckhands, who suggest
that there may have been an excess of
mud in the boilers.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 26.â The
towboat Fred Wilson was torn to splin
ters, ten men were blown to pieces and
sixteen others injured by a tremendous
explosion of the boat's boilers at 3:30
o'clock this morning. Of the thirty
three persons aboard the boat only
seven escaped unhurt. Of the injured,
one will probably die. The force of the
explosion was so great that It shat

deny any knowledge of where the girl
is at the present time, though they

OAKLAND, May 20.â Through somebody's
forgetfulnessâ or snail tve say stupidity**â
the wedding ceromony which united Miss
Maud Selrna Myers and Mark gtrouse this
t^venlnfc was delayed over half an hour.
\\ hilo the bridtTjrtxmi and guests waited at
the church, the pretty bride and her retinue
listened in vain for the sound of carrhitjtf
whecJsâ the hackmen had gone astray some
where between the Merrimac street residence
and St. John's Church. Finally, however,
matters were straightened out by meana of
the telephone and the anxious assemblasfi
heavwl a great slÂ£h of relief when, at 0:10
the triumphant strains of the wedding march
announced the approach of the bride.
Notwithstanding the awkward little con
tretemps at tho beginning, the wedding was
a. very pretty little affair, and no more charm
1p; bride ever wended her way to the little
altar of St. John's. Her dress of white silk
creiM? de I'nris and rare Duchesse- lace fitted
her slender figure perfectly. A long veil of
tulle fell almost to the hem of the trained
skirt, and Â»he carried a shower of orchids
and lilies of the. valley.
As the bridesmaids led the way to the
nltar. one received an impression of a pink,
fluffy mass of silk and chiffon and lacy ruf
fles. All were gowned nearly alike In pink
crepe de chine and each fair young attend
ant carried a shower, of pink roses. The
bridesmaids were Misses Jessie Burns. Wini
fred Osborne, Klsle Ames. Lucile Webster,
Mamie Stroud and Gertrude McMillan.
Miss ' Mae Myers attended her ai
maid of honor, and wore a very becoming

request of Senator Gorman, the con

instruct for him.
BALTIMORE, May 26.â The Demo
cratic State Convention of Maryland
met in this city to-day, adopted a plat
form and elected delegates to the St.
Louis convention. United States Sen
ator Gorman was a delegate from
Howard County, and his entry Into
the convention hall was a signal for
applause, as was every remark made
by the Senator.during the proceedings.
The platform adopted by the conven
tion admittedly embodies Gorman's
opinion of what the national platform
should be, he being a member of the
resolutions committee. It calls for
moderate tariff revision, independence
of the Philippines, economy in expend
itures and full investigation of al!
alleged crookedness in the PostofSce
and other Government departments
and severely criticizes the present ad
ministration.

I cannot say what amount of money was
paid to Mrs. Kane or what are the term's of
compromise. All that can be said is that
everything has bÂ«Â«n adjusted in a very satis
factory wmy and to the gratification of thoye
concerned. The only regret we have is that
the suit nai brought while negotiations were
In hand. In fact, on expert report on the condi
tion of the bu?ineÂ«s was und?r way when the
HtiRation was begun. Mr. Hanifln dtd not want
any tirht in court with the wife of his de
cfiiFed partner.
Litigation over the affairs of J. J.
Hanlfin & Co., the pioneer wholesale
and retail licuor firm of this city, has
been averted by "a compromise of the
suiÂ£ which Mrs. Louisa Kane, wife of
the late Frank J. Kane, brought
against J. J. Hanifln for an account-
Ing. The conflicting interests were
adjusted to-day and a formal dis
missal of the litigation will be filed to
morrow in the Superior Court.
The settlement with Mrs. Kane was
on a liberal basis, and, according to
Hanifln'a counsel, thoroughly satis
factory to both sides. It concludes all
of the claims which Mrs. Kane made
to an interest in the business as the
survivor of her husband, who was for
many years a partner with Hanlfin.
Mrs. Kane's Interest was represent
ed by a bill of sale to her of her hus
band's interest, which was made short
ly before his death. Oh the Ilanifin
side it was disputed that this gave
Mrs. Kane a right to be represented
as a partner, though it was recognized
that she had equitable rights in the
profits and the business.
As a matter of fact, negotiations
with' the dead partner's wife were in
progress when the suit was suddenly
and quite unexpectedly launched. Han
ifln had at no time given evidence of
any desire to make other than a fair
and equitable settlement. His attor
ney, George W. Reed, was taken much
by surprise wherrciotice of the suit was
given.
Attorney Reed made the following
statement yesterday:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, May 26.
In speaking of Manager Shepard's
offer, Street Superintendent Froder
said:
We were aston!=bed when Mr. Shepard >aid
that the Pacific Improvement Company would
build a roadway thirty-five feet wide from the
Webster-street bridge to the carhouse. It may
be that Mr. EheparJ has figured that it would
be cheaper for his corporation to hui'd a thir
ty-ftve foot rcadway^than to pay the assessment
toward the construction of the sixty-foot roa<i
way that we had planned. As the chance of
securing enough assistance to build the larger
roadway at this time did not seem particularly
bright, we concluded re accept Mr. Shepard"s
plan.
ALAMEDA, May 26. â A. D. Shep
ard, manager of the Pacific Improve
ment Company, has informed a com
mittee of citizens interested in the re
building of the Webster street road
way that his corporation, which owns
most of the frontage on the thorough
fare, will do the work free of cost to
the city and all others.
This promise was made by Manager
Shepard in his office in San Francisco
last evening to members of the com
mittee on betterment of the roads.
The members of the committee were
surprised at the offer of Manager
Shepard, who said that his corporation
would construct a macadamized road
way thirty-five feet wide, extending
from the Webster-street bridge across
the marsh to the carhouse of the Oak
land Transit Consolidated, a distance
exceeding 4000 feet. He said that
macadam would be laid over the pres
ent roadway and that the car track on
the west side of the thoroughfare
would not be disturbed. He guaran
teed that the new roadway would last
at least five years.
The plan that the Joint committee
of Alameda and Oakland has been
working on for the improvement of
the Webster-street roadway called for
a thoroughfare sixty feet wide, with
sidewalk grades ten feet wide and
double car tracks in the center. There
was to be a redwood plank founda
tion to the roadway and it was to be
heavily macadamized. The Oakland
Transit Consolidated had agreed to
construct a strip of the roadway nine
teen and a half feet wide the entire
length. Eight thousand dollars was to
be raised by popular subscription in
this city and in Oakland and the re
mainder of the funds needed, about
$22,000, the Pacific Improvement
Company was to be asked to con
tribute. The entire cost of the road
way planned bv the committee was
550.000.

In a fight before the Sequoia Athletic
Club. The match was scheduled for
a ten-round go. but in the sixth Tye
went to ihe mat for pood nfter taking
one of the roost severe beatings sfJ
niinistered in the local prize ring in
years. His friends say that he has not
since been rithl in his mind.
Prior to this lipht Tye had not
fought in some years, lie had vir
tually retired from Use ring. Hut he
was iocked out in the recent butchers
trouble and to tide him over his idle
period he went back to the old game.
He found that his long rest had taken
him out of the fighting class. He was
a member of the old Acme Club here,
the first organization of the kind in
this city, and in times gone by was
the i>ride of a large circle of ad
mirers.
In his recent match he weighed
about 137 pounds. He looked in good
condition, but lacked the snap and
Bteam of his old day*. Against a young
and powerful antagonist he was woe
fully deilcient. but nuns on gamely
while his adversary gave him an un

was sort to the lloor. His teeth were

When taken from the ring he was

The Council has under consideration
a reduction in the rate of interest to
be allowed on the company's invest
ment. It Is almost a certainty that
not more than 6 per cent net will be
allowed. The company asks for 7
per cent. The final report will proba
bly not be made before the latter part
of next week.
To this end the Councjl is making
comparisons of the valuation with fig
ures heretofore submitted by exports
employed by the city. The company's
basis is a valuation of $7,000,000. So
far as the Council has gone it is es
timated that the members have prac
tically agreed upon a reduction of
$1,000,000 or more frum the Contra
Costa Water Company's figures. Much
of the property has been appraised by
experts and lower values than those
lixed by the company have been
reached.
OAKLAND. May 26. â The City
Council in executive session . to-night
resumed its inquiry in the matter of
water rates. The work was in the
lhala an examination item by item of
the valuation sihedule of the Contra
Costa Water Company's plant as fur
nished by Kngineer Arthur LÂ». Ad
ams. The problem before the Council
is to determitie whether the company's
figures can be reduced with equity to
the corporation and to the city.

United States Local Inspectors Bolles and

yesterday: That on Sunday morning. May 1.
1904, the. ateamer Henrietta, Thomas Boyd
master, left her berth In San Francisco at 4:10
a. m., on her>way to sea, and when off Powell-
Rtreet wharf, with eighty pounds eteam pressure
en the boiler, a blind tube blew out, scalding
B. A. Connelly, the engineer, and ' inflicting
ouch eerlous Injuries) upon Polindo Tognctti.
the fireman, as caused his death a few hours
later. Upon examination of the boiler after
the explosion, we discovered that In Its con
struction two blind tubes, earh twelve Inches
long, were inserted in the ..back tube sheet,
and there were no corresponding holes in the
front of th<* tuf>e sheet. We therefore ordered
the blind tubes removed, tube holes to be cut In
the front tube sheet, and through tubes placed
in the boiler from head to heart. This work
was done by the Fulton Iron Works, who built
the boiler In the year 1S0S. We have to note
In tho case, of this boiler that the blueprint
and boiler-maker's affidavit furnished by the
builders specified that It contained 06 tubes,
but the above examination showed that there
were only 04 through tubes and the two blind
tubes previously noted. The boi!Â«r was last
annually inspected* March 21, 1001. and ar^
lowed a working steam pressure of 140 pounds.
On May 21 the case was Investigated and from
the testimony taken therein we are of the
opinion that the above explosion would not
ha\ - e occurred had the blind Â¦ tubes not â¢ been
placed In the boiler. Therefore, under the cir
cumstances, we do not attach any blame to
Mr. B. A. Connelly, the engineer. In connec
tion with this casualty. Damage to the boiler
estimated at abcut $100.

BODY OF YOUXG WOMAN*
IS FOUND IX A POND
ATLANTA, Ga.. May 26.â The body, of Miss
Sophie Kloecklcr was found In the water
works pond at Lakewood, a suburb of Atlanta
to-day. The younjr woman left her home Tues
day morning- presumably to go to work and
after that time was not seen alive. The girl's
family, which Is eminently respectable eay
there Is no reason why she should have killed
herself.
SANTA ROSA. May 26.â While riding down
Fourth street this morning: on a bicycle Misa
Ida. Campbell's left foot slipped and caught be
tween th^ pedal and the frame of the wheel.
The foot became yo firmly wedged In the ma
chine that the efforts of three men were re
quired to release it. Miss Campbell was
thrown, but was not badly injured.
Deputy Coroner McCormick express
ed his suspicion that the note was a
fake. The note purported to be a
confession by the girl to her parents
and to give her sensations after tak
ing the poison. But the last line was
written in as free and firm a hand as
the first.
Late yesterday afternoon a re
porter for an evening paper sent to the
Coroner's office a note which, he said,
had been brought to the newspaper
office by a. detective. It was neither
addressed nor signed, and was writ
ten in pencil in a bold, free hand.
Later a telephone message came from
the newspaper to the effect that two
boys had found the note near the girl's
house and had given it to the news
paper.
Agnes left home last Friday morn
ing an,d was not seen again by her
mother until she was found uncon
scious.
On several occasions the girl had
been absent all night from home in
company with dissolute girls of her
own age. Some time ago on one of
these absences the police found her
with male and female companions in
"the Carroll House on Sixth street. The
girl's mother blames another girl liv
ing in the neighborhood for her daugh
ter's downfall and says that she had
enticed Agnes away from home on*
more than one occasion.
Little Willie Welch, her 11-year-old
brother, went into the yard at 5 o'clork
yesterday morning to get kindling
wood and found his sister lying un
conscious. By her side was a bottle
which had contained carbolic acid.
The Seventeenth-street police station
was notified and the girl was sent to
the City and County Hospital, where
she died two hours later.
Agnes Welch, a 16-year-old girl who
had been led astray by ..evil compan
ions, killed herself yesterday by swal
lowing carbolic acid in a small build
ing in the rear of her parents' resi
dence, 22 Chenery street.

in order to test the truth of old tradi

after Columbus made his discoveries.

IT is remembered as an interesting future of our war
with Spain and the subsequent military actions that
not a single war lyric was written of sufficient dignity
to survive in memory or popularity. During our Civil
War both sections were vocal with stirring war songs.
In the North "The Battle" Hymn . of the Republic,"
"Marching Through Georgia," Tenting To-night," and in
the South "My Maryland," "The Bonnie Blue Flag" and
scores of inspiring lyrics were written, set to music and
sung, and many of them survive among the lyrical
classics of our literature.. They had great influence in
thrilling the martial spirit â Union and Confederate â and
it is doubtful if in any other war such compositions
ever played as great a part. Major and minor poets,
mono-poets and professional song writers, all entered a
field in which a catching and lilting song was sure of
immediate and immense popularity. Kv^v-
But in our Spanish war the singers, great and small,
were conspicuous only by their silence. ; The inspiration
of that'war and of its cause seems to stop at oratory and
exhaust itself in that form of expression. , In Congress
some notable speeches were made by ; Proctor of Ver
mont* Thurston of Mason of Illinois and
others. Still it* is doubtful if any , of these will go/,into
permanent literature or the school books.
The absence of war lyrics in that recent period of our
history is made all the more remarkable by the fact that
our poets and song writers seem to be finding inspira
tion in the Japanese-Russian war that is producing some
excellent results. "The Cossacks of the Don" is' a fine
production, and Joaquin. Miller's "Fishers of Nippon/'
and the still later "Navy of Japan," are excellent exam
ples of lyric poetry with war, for its motive. It is note

MODOC INDIANSâ C. S.. Oakland.
Cal. The Modoc Indians originally oc
cupied lands on the Klamath Lake.
Cal. They were hostile against tlw
whites as early as 1847 and continued
such hostilities until 1864. Â¦when they
ceded their lands and agreed to go on
a reservation, which, however, -was not
set apart for them until 1871. In the
meantime they went on the Klamath
reservation,* and later on the Yalnax
reservation. A band of the Modocs
under Captain Jack deserted the res
ervation in 1S72 and settled on the Lost
River. Then followed the hostilities
when they refused to leave that settle
ment, and their pilgrimage to the Lava
Beds. Captain Jack was captured in
June, 1S73.
THE "American Flag Association" of New York
City has issued a letter calling to mind the fact that
June 14, 1904, will be the one hundred and twenty
seventh anniversary of the adoption by Congress of the
stars and stripes as the flag of the United States, and
urging that that day be suitably observed.
The "American Flag Association" was organized on
February 17, 1898, and is composed of individuals and
members of flag committees from various patriotic so
cieties in this country, united to foster public sentiment
toward honoring the national emblem. It asks in the
letter that the flag be displayed upon municipal build
ings, churches and private dwellings, that schoolteachers
arrange for patriotic exercises "appropriate to the day,
and that American patriotic societies throughout the
country generally be urged to assist in awakening public
enthusiasm in the observance of the anniversary:
. Although the flame of American patriotism is of the
kind that glows perpetually and needs not much annual
renewal it is well that the birthday of our beautiful flag
should not pass unobserved. Reverence for it is not
entirely an unmeaning sentiment. It is commingled with
the respect and love we have for our country, of which
the flag is the tangible, visible symbol, appealing more
directly to the senses. That symbol suggests the enjoy
ment of liberty for which this Government was founded.
It brings out our better thoughts, for in it there is
nothing of greed or self, and it serves to bind' us closer
together as a people striving with high ideals 'for the
common cause of humanity; therefore, no fitting ocasion
should be neglected upon which to keep it before us.
Prince Pu LunJ the distinguished representative of
Chinese royalty who is diverting us with his picturesque
presence, has found that the operation of an automobile
with safety to the operator and his immediate neighbor
hood is a triumph not yet recorded in favor of an Ori

machine and then trust to chance. The rest of us have
been educated by experience to get out of the way.

A CITIZENâ L. M. G., % City: A
woman born in the United States is a
citizen of the Union and of the par
ticular State In which she claims her
residence. The fact that in some States
she cannot vote does not cut any fig
ure. If she is an alien and her hus
band becomes a citizen of the United
States his act In that direction makes
her a citizen.
It is refreshing to know that since San Francisco has
the misfortune to house a few anarchists their most seri
ous offense which has been made public in years was
their recent entertainment, harmless and rational, of one
of their fellows from the Old World. As long as these
pests of society have within them a feeling of friendli
ness and hospitality for men as little deserving of either
as themselves then there is some hope for their re
generation.
THE FUTUREâ Mel Mar, City: It

A news dispatch from Louisville,
Ky., to the New York Times s'ays that
carefully wrapped in bandages and
laboring under the delusion that she
has undergone a dangerous operation
for a tumor in the stomach, a New
Albany, Ind., woman lies at the Ken
tucky University on Broadway, while
her physicians are carefully watching
her In the hope that their unique de
ception may permanently cure the
hysteria with which she has been af
flicted for several months.
The experiment is a rare one. The
patient was operated upon several
years ago. Since that time her phy
sicians say she has been constantly
harassed with the hallucination that
there would be an ultimate recurrence
of the tumorous growth.
About three months ago she sus
tained a fright which upset her
nerves. A few days afterward she
fancied she detected symptoms of a
recurrence of the tumor. Her phy
sicians made a careful examination,
but could find no traces of the growth.
She insisted on an operation, how
ever, and the physicians arranged the
deception.
Just enough opiates were admin
istered to reduce her to a state of
semi-consciousness. She could hear
and feel vaguely, but could see noth
ing. The physicians, speaking grave
ly, spent considerable time in definite
ly locating the supposed tumor.
When all was in readiness one of
the doctors produced a pitcher of Ice
water, which he held above the part
supposed to be affected and allowed
a drop to fall at Intervals of about
fifteen seconds. With each drop of
water the patient winced and groaned
as if In great agony. Once or twice
she could be heard to whisper that
the doctors be "careful and . not cut
her too deep. Finally, when it -was
thought the hoax had been success
fully carried to c6mpletion, the doc
tors swathed the patient in bandages
and had her removed to a room.
On being awakened she found her
self in the presence of two trained
nurses, whÂ© are keeping up the de
ception by not allowing her to move
a muscle. Although she has the ap
petite ' and strength of a normal
woman, she lies perfectly passive and
submits cheerfully to the diet of clear
broth.
The physicians say they will allow
her to leave the infirmary in about
three weeks.
Saved by Falsehood.
An interesting discovery has just
been made at Quezac (Lozere), France,
by some customs officials. As the re
sult of anonymous information they
climbed into the spire of the church,
and after a careful search found a
still which, although dating from the
seventeenth century, was yet in a per
fect state of preservation and capable
of being worked. Naturally the re
quirements of the law with regard to
apparatus of this description had not
been complied with in this case, but
who was the offender? The vicar In
charge of the building? The sacristan
who visited weekly? Interrogated, the
former declared that he had only re
cently come Into the parish and had
never set foot in the spire. He was
therefore totally ignorant of the ex v
istence of the Incriminating vessel.
The sacristan, however, could not
allege so valid an excuse, and his ex
planation not being satisfactory, he
will be proceeded against.â The Paris

The most numerous birds, and those
which give the Antarctic Its one ad
vantage over the more popular Arctic,
are its penguins. They are of two
kinds, the more numerous small, blunt
billed Adelie, and the less^ numerous
but much larger Emperor penguin,
which weiffhs about 60 or 70 pounds,
and stands well over 3 feet high. It
possesses extraordinary muscular pow.
er in Its flippers. When presented with
the end of a ski stick the Emperor
penguin â¢ "gives It such a smack that
one's hands tingle." At the same time
It utters an angry guttural exclama
tion. â London News.
Dr. Soulter supplies interesting par
ticulars regarding animal life in that
cold region. The chief denizens are
seals, penguins, and varieties of petrels.
Seals are now very abundant here,
though widely scattered. They are
very tame, and "can be clubbed by
any one, without showing mare fight
than opening their Jaws and making a
harsh noise." They possess extraordin
ary vitality, and are not easy to kill.
Antarctic seals are of four kinds, but in
McMurdo Bay one kind, Weddell's, are
most common, and provide the best
eating. In pack-ice the crab-eater seal
is common, but. "has not such a good
taste." The coat* of Weddell's seal,
especially when young, possesses a
beautiful sheen, and. feels quite soft,
but Antarctic seals are not provided
with marketable fur. The skin of the
majority of seals in the Antarctic re^.
gions shows an entraordinary' number
of cicatrices, some old and some recent,
which have been for some time a puzzle
to zoologists, the question being wheth
er they are the rcfcult of warfare among
bull seals for possession of the females,
or are caused by attacks of some mon
ster not yet known to science. Some
little light has been shed on this sub
ject by the discovery, probably almost
unique, of the remains of an ordinary
seal in the stomach of a sea-leopard,
which is provided with a very fierce
set of teath, indicating a possible habit
of feeding on other seals.
As soon as a seal has been killed
skua gulls, the scavengers of the Ant
arctic, come up to the place in large
numbers. They are not at all timid,
for they "come close up and commence
eating straight away." The skua is
of a faded chocolate color, and in flight
shows a white bar on each wing. It
possesses webbed feet, fitted with claws
like those of a hawk widely dis
tributed. The giant petrel, which is
also a scavenger, scours the whole
country and ocean in search of the
carcass of some unlucky beast. It will
feed upon the carcass until so abso
lutely gorged that it is unable to rise
off the ice in flight. It then runs along
the ice if chased, spreading its wings
out like sails. Before being captured,
however, the petrel suddenly stops, and
disgorges a quantity of semi-digested
footi, and then goes off at a run again.
"If overtaken a second time it will
repeat the performance, and, having
once got rid of Its dinner, gets up and
flies off."
Fuller detals are now to hand of the
discoveries made by those on board the
Discovery during their long sojourn in
the Antarctic.
Antarctic Fauna.
As escargots, or snails, are not
much eaten in this country, the dis
covery that artificial snails are made
will not worry American epicures. In
Paris it is different. Public knowl
edge of this enterprise came about
through the suit of a Paris workman
against his employer for injuries re
ceived in manipulating a machine for
fabricating snails. It was explained
that the employer bought empty snail
shells from the dustmen and rag
pickers. Having cleaned out the
shells, the defendant and his people
filled them with "mou," that is to say,
lights, or cat's meat. This soft,
spongy stuff, before being crammed
into the shells, was cut into cork
screw shape by very improved ma
chines. When the shell was filled
some liquid fat or* grease was poured
into it and the trick was done. The
fabricated snails were sold usually at
20 centimes the dozen. Sometimes,
when there is a great run on snails,
the manufacturers get a good deal of
their "raw material" from Germany.
It is affirmed that there are actually
some epicures in Paris who prefer
the sham snail to the genuine article,
even when the latter has been among
the vine leaves in Burgundy. The ar
tificial escargot is said to have a spe
cial flavor, which is highly appre
ciated.

Pacific Ocean famous for porcelain

"The inhabitants were rich and
luxurious and had a contempt for re

He himself was religious. He had a

happen when the two faces of the
Idols in the temple turn red. The two
idols were called Infoniwoo and Awun

night painted the faces of these idols
red. The King, hearing of the change
of color, lost no time in getting aboard
a ship. Then the island sunk and all
were drowned except Peiroun. He got
safe to China."

the Teh.achapi Pass, it was astonishing to the southern
producers to find that their profits had vanished. The
values of lands in orange orchards were menaced. A
strong inducement to Eastern people to make their
homes in Southern California was jeopardized.
Nothing is done by halves in Southern California.
When the people came to the conclusion that they would
find out what was the matter with the orange market
they went at the work in earnest. Every fact that could
be brought to light was revealed. Many columns of
newspaper space have b#cn devoted to a narration of
facts and the discussion of remedies. No topic has at
tracted more earnest and prolonged attention in the
south in the memory of the oldest inhabitant.
A change has been provided for that will soon be ef
fective. The Los Angeles Times and other southern
newspapers say that better times are now in view. Ac
cording to the Los Angeles Times high freight rates,
the. competition of Florida and other orange-producing
countries and "freeze-out" methods on tirie part of the
California Fruit Agency directed against independent
shippers have been factors to cause depression in the
market for Southern California's citrus fruits. .
For many years the business of handling and selling
oranges in the United States was divided among many
people, some of whom,' qr their predecessors, had been
so engaged for half a' century. The California Fruit
Agency undertook to put these people out of business.
As a means of warfare they urged on the market, as
against California, the Florida, Mexico and Porto Rico
oranges.
The California Fruit Agency has given notice that it
will retire from business. On September 1 the California
Citrus Union will resume. The Times now advocates
open competition for the Southern California oranges.
"Let growers who wish to combine do so," says the
Times, "and go after purchasers wherever they may be
found. Let others invite buyers; let home fruit auc
tions be established and they will do business; let it be
understood that the golden fruit is for sale to the highest
bidder; under such systems the buyers will be there â
buyers for the fruit on the trees, buyers for the fruit
f. o. b." . *
Every citizen north of Tehachapi will wish that the
anticipation of his southern neighbors may be amply
realized. The Los Angeles Herald says it is believed
that an auction system will be established whereby a
great part of the yield of Southern California's orange
groves will be marketed in Southern California and at
dealers' rather than at the growers' risk.
THE MARKETING OF ORANGES.
The Mothers' Club of New York, variously active in
the pursuit of sweetness and light, has decided that men
may become members of the organization upon a strictly
associative basis and without the privilege of a vote. No
one of the male persuasion has yet indicated that he
wishes to be enrolled officially in the interesting category
of old women. But even the suggestion must be sweet
revenge to the Mothers' Club.
The Hartford, Conn., Courant pub
lishes a new anecdote concerning the
strenuousness of old Ben Butler while
he was in occupation of New Orleans.
"General Butler had eiven ah order
that arms should not be carried by
civilians," says the Courant informer,
"and one day when I was conversing
with the general an orderly addressed
a young woman who happened to be
passing, carrying a large revolver in
her belt. The orderly* informed her
of General Butler's order. The young
woman became enraged instantly and
spit in the orderly's face. General
Butler saw the incident. He stepped
up to the young woman, placed hisr
foot against the building, took thjf
young person across his knee and
gave her an example of Puritanical |
corporal punishment such as she 1
would never forget as long as she
lived.
"During this interesting proceeding
the young woman yelled vigorously,
but finding that unavailing to secure
release, bit her teeth into the calf of
General Butler's leg. WhenÂ«the gen
eral had administered what he con
sidered sufficient punishment for her
rude conduct he lifted her to her feet
and said, 'Young woman, you can now
go home and tell your mother that
you have had a bite of good Yankee
flesh."
Spanked by Butler.
It was not so long ago that one who
had been impressed with the amount of
matter which appeared in print under
Andrew Lans's name expressed the
conviction that Mr. Lang was a "syn
dicate," and if G..K. Chesterton doesn't
lock out he will be under a similar sus
picion. You can't get away from him.
Hardly had his "Life of Browning" ap
1-earcd than his novel "A Napoleon of
Netting' Hill" was announced, and now
we. have an appreciation of G. F. Watts
from Mr. Chesterton's nimble pen, and
the promise of a work by him on
Charles Kingsley. Meanwhile the writer
keeps on with his regular weekly de
liverance in the Daily News, not to
mention that in Black and White, and
one can see how all this is possible
only by conceiving that Mr. Chesterton
leads a double life and works in both
halves of it. HEYDEN CHURCH.
when the newspapers announced that
the Saracen's Head in Snow Hill had
been offered for sale. This is the public
house and inn which Dickens made the
London headquarters of the celebrated
Mr. Squeers and from which he started
the schoolmaster and Nicholas Nickleby
for Dotheboy's Hall by the Yorkshire
ccach. Tradition says that the Sara
ctn's Head, which stands in a district
that of late years has been taken pos
session of almost wholly by the repre
sentatives of American firms, is a mod
ern replica of an ancient building which
owed its name to the Crusades.
THE conditions on the Â«ast side of New York City
have recently attracted the attention of sociologists
and settlement workers. It is said that in that
part of the city there are tens of thousands of idle boys,
from 15 to 20 years of age, who have had some school
ing, are strong, brawny and idle. Having nothing to do
they infest the slums and add to their horrors. They
present the greatest problem with which the police have
to contend, and they seem irrevocably dedicated to vice,
crime and transgression. *
Their idleness resists all moral teaching. While it
would be easy to discipline and control them if they
were working no impression can be made upon their
moral sense while they are loafers. What to do with
them is the despair of the legal authorities and of the
social workers, who find them inflexibly obdurate to all
control. It is one of the sad features in that tendency of
our population to gravitate to cities. Unfortunately the
vast majority of our foreign immigration remains in the
large cities where it lands. Instead of being affected and
instructed by our American spirit and point of view the
influence is the other way and that spirit and point of
view are weakened and distorted.
There is created in cities corrupt material for use in
politics, and municipal administration is too often mas
tered by the rampant* vice which has access to the ballot.
Churches establish missions in the infected districts, but
ihc efforts made in them to stem the tide of immorality
and lawlessness are made useless by the idleness of the
class on which they are wrought.' That idleness takes
out of life all saneness of motive and Tightness of pur
pose, and religion, morality and ethics are things with
out meaning to a population in which vice and crime are
the sole possible activities within reach. If the abhor
rent panorama were impressed upon the country bred
population its tendency to seek the cities might be
checked. But this is not done and the fresh life flows
from the fields to the slums to be stained and lost.
These conditions were brought sharply to the attention
of the country by an occurrence last Sunday. A v rail
road president and his wife, while passing through that
east side district of New York in an automobile, going
slowly and avoiding anything that would excite, the
mob, were beset by an immense number of these vicious
young men. Apparently attracted by the jewelry of the
woman, they knocked her senseless with stones and
crowded upon her to steal her ornaments. This was in
the middle of Sunday afternoon in the chief city of the
continent.
We read of train robberies in lonely, stretches of rail
ways, at night/ and they impress us. But, after all, they
are but trifles compared to this daylight savagery in a
great city. A train robbery shows the criminal enter
prise of a few daring men, but this- assault in a city is
a sickening evidence of the demoralization and degen
eracy of a community made sordid by the idleness of its
youth. A bandit in Morocco seized, in his own house, an
American citizen and carried him into the mountains to
secure a ransom. ..Our navy is ordered to that coast and
the Sultan of Morocco is commanded by the American
Consul to take immediate steps for the release of the
prisoner, and will be compelled to pay whatever ran
som is exacted by his captors. But that crime is of less
consequence than the assault and attempted robbery on
Sunda>' afternoon in New York City.
m In the East there is constant comment on the wild ways
of the woolly West. But no event in the history of the
West is so fearful as a deadly symptom as this barbar
ism in the streets of New York. If the growth of our
great cities carry with it the increase of such evils and
the multiplication of such problems it should cease to be
a matter of pride, and become a thing to be keenly
feared. When a passage through the streets becomes as
dangerous as through a wolf-infested Russian forest it is
time to fill the highways with missionaries who will
preach the gospel of work as a cure for evils, present and
to come.
If immigration is so large as to make its assimilation
impossible, but to make it actually a force that assimi
lates us, it should be reduced again to a digestible
quantity. If congestion of population in cities can be
controlled and prevented in no other way it must be dis
tributed to the country, where the farms and fields call
for the laborers who are too few for the work that must
be done.
SAVAGERY IN CITIES.
sources, the poets and song writers adopt the native
name Nippon for Japan. Its superior euphony seems to
commend it to the poetic sense. If the struggle continue
our lyrical literature seems destined to be very much en
riched and our poets will make up for their singular
silence during our own war.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 26.
Mystery surrounds the disappearance
of a dead man's gold. Martin Hamann,
an aged inmate of the German Alten
heim, Fruitvale, committed suicide
yesterday. He had drawn $3000 in $20
pieces from an Oakland bank on May
17. Search for'the coin since Hamann's
death (has uncovered no trace of the
gold. V
John Behrmann, an old friend of
Hamann, and a pioneer of San v Lean
dro, accepts responsibility for the story
concerning the disappearance of the
old man's hoard. Behrmann has spe
cial interest in finding the coin, for he
has been made sole devisee and legatee
In Hamann's will to all of his old
friend's possessions.
A week ago Tuesday Hamann sent
for Behrmann. Together they went to
a bank in this city and Behrmann says
he saw his friend draw the 53000 in
gold and take it with him to the Alten
heim. At that time, Behrmann says,
Hamann told him that he had left all
of his belongings to him.
Behrmann began a search to-day for
the gold, but so far has met with no
success. He has been unable to get a
trace of it at the Altenhelm, and he
fears that, the money has either been
lost or beÂ«n hidden away by Hamann
in a place/known only to the dead man.
The will Is to be filed to-morrow for
probate.

worth Park Meeting Pick
Off the Winners Cleverly
In the inid-rint discussion before thÂ» fljrht
it was agreed that the mÂ«n would box und<r
Queensberry rules, which allow a man to hit
if he is not holding an opponent. The an
nouncer told the spectators the men had a*ree>l
not to hit in the cl!ncheÂ«. but would break
clean. Roder.bach would hit and clinch and
the gallery would hoot Berber when he tried
to hit. both of his hands beins free. ThtÂ» dis
concerted Sammy and he went to pieces.
The small attendance at this fight and at
the Canole-Xelson affair Is taken as a Â«iRn
that the public !s weary of the fighters. A rest
of a few months would serve to quicken in
terest in the sport.
The RÂ«denharh-Bergfr fight furnished as live
ly an aftermath as any boxing enthusiast cv: !
desire. Ber^fr ha^ a double complaint te
make, lie insists he was not the Â» fcKressor in
the unseemly quarrel after the flsnt andtfha
claims he was not allowrd to box as were tlia
men in the other bouts. His friends claim that
in an endeavor to *howr thÂ» Kastern man fair
play Referee Graney favored him decidedly.
As to the quarrel in the corner each man
accuses the other of belnjr the a;Â«ri-<wnr.
Eugrn" Van Tourt seems to have been th*
Kreateat snfferrr. physiically. II<Â« was assistini;
Burger take off his gloves. After nodenbach
missed the Callfornian with his risht hÂ«s swunx
Â¦ sain witb his l"ft. Berber ducked thlsi and
it causht Van Court flush on the nosÂ«. }JÂ«
thought for a moment his ncse was hrokm.
but soon found the only damage was the loÂ»*

LOS AXGELES, May 26. â The
Champions fell upon Schmidt's curves

with Newton until the eighth inning,
when four hits gave them three runs.
Score:
Los Ancelreâ ( Oakland â
Knell started al! the trouble in the
seventh by banging a single into
right Held. Hildebrand sacrificed and
Waldron kicked through with a hot
one to center, scoring Knell. Meany
was there with one to left, . sending
Waldron to third. Irwin responded
with a good one and Waldron arrived.
Anderson's two-bagger to deep center
finished up the good work and com
pletely dashed the hopes of the Hrowns
and their admirers on the bleachers.

The game broke badly for Portland
in the second inning, when Henry
Reitz hit a hot liner to Thielman,
breaking the middle finger of the lat
ter's left hand. EJutler then took up
the slabster's burden and in every
round but the seventh he kept the lo
cals away from the pan.
Up to that time it was a peculiar
game of ball. Five men had been
nailed at the plate â four of the home
team and - one Portlander. Another
trio had been nabbed off the bags or
else nailed trying to stretch singles
into double?. The only bad feature of
the game was the time it consumed.
Knell was slower than any truck horse
that ever aerformed on the water
front. He gave the bleacheritcs thÂ«
jimmies, and they did not lose any
chances to express their opinion of
his slowness.
Mr. Butler's -wires became crossed
in the seventh inning yesterday at
Recreation Park, and ere he could un
wind the fierce tangle the Natives be
gan to swoop down on his delivery. It
was a fierce onslaught while it lasted
and the Harris brigade came out of
the fracas with four entered on their
books, enough to win with a bunch
to spare. Score: San Francisco, 5;
Portland, 1.

PKOPKR FINISHES THIRD.
The Picket, running easily in third
place, inade a steady pate for the bal
ance of the neld. The Thomas repre
sentative and the favorite struggled in
vain, each to master the other. Across
The circular track from the grand
h'laml and three-quarters: of a mile
from the starting point they were run
ning like n ne horse. In this manner
they swung around the far turn and
made for the last one, which would lead
them into the stretch. Sh.iv. on the
favoi ite, and Redf^rn. on Horn::?, were
bringinc Â«.-ut every ounce of speed in
their mounts, while Helsersen was
drawing The Picket together for the
final rush to the gc-al. He closed a gap
Â«>f two or three lengths and before they
l:ad reached the last Quarter poie was
â¢ lose upon the tiring leaders. Hermis
had run his race and was dropping:
bÂ»<*k. and Shaw swung the favorite a
â¢trifle wide. As he did fo Hr-Igersen shot
in on the rail, and in a driving lini?h.
seventy yards from the wire. The
Picket's nose showed in front of Irish
Lad. Lyne. on Proper, in a vigorous
ride, brought the Jennings candidate
Kjongside trf Hermis, who fell back to
fourth place.
There was an extraordinary scene of
excitement during the brief space of
time which elapsed after the strug
gling thoroughbreds had passed the
three-quarter post. Cries from thou
sands urging on the favorite and
shrieking the name of his jockey rent
the air. When Hermis fell back upon
Â« nterins the stretch and it seemed al
most certain that Irish Lad would re
peat his victory of last year, forty
thousand persons .screamed his
name, men threw up their hats and
embraced one another out of sheer
delight at being fortunate enough
to have witnessed the grand strug
gle. They did not realize how
â¢ lose up Helg^ifen had brought
the pÂ«j of ihe Waldeck Stables.
nor did they observe that Shaw, on
Irish l^id. was net as near the rail as
he might have be'n. The Western horse
responded^ nobly to the call. Through
b pap barely wide enough for him to
pass, he made his run and won by thÂ»
.length of his muzzle.
niE i'kkih <;oi\<; easily
Proper, the California candidate,
ci,:no through ;it the end Â«nd beat out
>'ormis for third place. The time for
Ibe mile was 3:39 !'-."Â» and for the mile
and a Quarter -:06 P.-5 â one and one
tifth seconds slower than the race
made by lri?li Lad last year. The
handicap was worth $20,000. of which
J:.\">00 went to the second horse and
JK>00 to the third.
Iltlsil l..\IÂ» HEAVILY BACKED.
Tlic J'^tviiis Â»inp *vaa a sweltering
nrass ol humanity. Xo sooner had thf
odds been ,iv>.Â«te(i than there was a
i uÂ«h to bark It ; sh Lad. Three and a
Jv<if i.i <ine were the prevailing quota
tions for a time, but money poured
'Meadily im>> tlio ring:, and when the
basic called the fiHd to the po.Â«t no
better than 11 t<> 5 Â«-ouid be bad against
the favorite. Hermis opened and Â«-losed
Â«i 4 to i. The I'iÂ»-ket was well played,
but his prii-e receded only two points.
From I" to 1 he was backed to S to
! Much of the speculation on the
w Inner, however. was conducted
ihrcruph the Winter book?, and large
flints were won both here a?id in the
"VWst on bis victory. Every horse in
i he rate was played in a desultory
manner, but the bulk of the public
wagers continued to pour i it on the
favorite until the horses appeared in
front of the grand stand on their wa>
t-> the post.
Starter Fitzgerald lined them up
back <>f tfce barrier, and. after thre
r.imuter" delay, sent them away in
splendid order. Irish Lad took the rail
;itni led his field, with The 1'icket sec
;ind Hermis third. Helpersen. on The
Picket, ?> i r= mount a trifle, and
v lion ih<- racers passed the grand
stand Hermis and Irish Lad had hook
ed up iside by side for their heart
breaking struggle, which was to c "-ri
tinue for nearly a nMle.
N'EW YORK, May 2S.â Coming down
along the rail in the last few strides
of the run to the wire. The Picket,
th* West's champion in the Brooklyn
handicap to-day, snatched victory
away from Irish I^ad, the Brooklyn
winner nf last year and the Metropoli
tan winner of this year. It was scarce
ly more than th? difference of a head,
but the Westerner finished stronger
than the Duryea colt, whose terrific
pace with Fiermis up to the home
6U etch wonld have tried to the ut
jmist the stoutest Â»f hearts and the
*iurdicsi of limbs. Frantic cheers
n-hicti had been ringing from the
throats of nearly 40,000 spectators died
away when it uas realized that Irish
],Â«<1 had RfiK* down to defeat.

CHICAGO, May 26. â Jockey Milton
Henry was seriously injured in the
first, race at Worth track to-day, in
which he rode Aid Carey's Michael
Byrnes, which fell at the half-mile
post, together with El Otros, ridden
by Feicht, and Dixie Lad, ridden by
Jockey C. Gray. The other two boys
escaped with a slight shaking up, but
Henry was found to be seriously hurt.
His nose was broken, a deep gash was
cut on his chin, and several of his
teeth were knocked out. El Otros,
which is owned by "Luckv" Baldwin,
was badly Injured. "Pa" Bradley's
Broadway Girl. bacRed from 8 to 6
to 1, proved the winner, leading all
the way.
Moharib was favorite for the third
race, which was the feature of the
card. John Schorr's Derby colt
opened at 6 to,| and went to 7 to 5.
Horatius, the second choice, at 2 to
1, was heavily played. Moharib went
to the front at the start and was
never headed, passing under the wire
two and a half lengths in front of
Horatius. The track was muddv and
sticky. It was rainins: and cold and
the attendance was the lightest of

The company has received many let
ters from property owners on Sutter
and Polk streets and Pacific avenue
asking for an electric service along
those thoroughfares to replace the
present antiquated cable line, and as
surance has been given by many of the
down town property owners of their
support if the company decides to con
struct a trolley system. Although Gen
eral Manager Chapman of the United
Railroads is not disposed to discuss
the question it was learned yesterday
that the company has two projects
awaiting the decision of the Board
of Supervisors. They are embraced in
the petition for a permit to electrize
the Ferries and Cliff .House line.
One la to make the latter part
of a through town service by
way of Devisadero and Sac
ramento streets, and the other is the
electrizing of the Sutter street road and
joining with it the Ferries and Cliff
House branch or the Sutro line on Cen
tral avenue, either of which projects
will greatly relieve the traffic on the
other lines on busy days and afford
better accommodations for downtown
people who seek an outing at the beach
on holidays.
The changing of thf Sutter street
cable system to an electric- road will,
according to estimates of the engineer
ing department of the United Rail
roads, take at least a year, during
which, however, cars would continue to
be operated along that street. The
Sutter street road has a five- foot
gauge, which would have to be en
tirely changed to the standard gauge,
necessitating the tearing up^ of the
whole roadbed, which Is reaching an
obsolete state.
Should these plans be carried out the
larger and more commodious elsctric
cars, recently placed on the Eddy street
line, will be substituted far thfe smaller
ones now in use ort the Sutter street
road and the carrying capacity and
the general accommodations will be en
hanced. The time schedule between
the center of the 'city and the ocean
beach also will be materially reduces.
The. transforming of the Sutter street
railway and its Polk street and Pa
cific avenue branch into an electric
road and making it part of a through
system to the ocean beach is a matter
now under, consideration by the man
agement of the United Railroads. The
plan will depend upon the action of the
Board of Supervisors In connection
with the proposition to permit the elec
trizing of the Ferries and Cliff House
steam road.

THE FUTURE REVEALED, THE PAST
DISCLOSED.
The Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarlon'a treatise that Is
so electrifying the world to-day. He is no
imitator. His work is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works in the open
light.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life, reading for $1. A test is
of little value; when the mind is troubled you
' need more substantial aid and advice. This
is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives
you when you call on him for a first-class
clilrvoyant reading.
He aeks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suKgrst the remedy.

This schedule calls for $2 50 a day for
nine hours' work and 35 cents an hour
for overtime, including Sundays and
holidays. The 1st of June is the time
fixed bv the union for the new rates to
go into effect. Over five hundred men
are represented by the union. The com
mittee on conference consists of:
Walter Hindle, J. Kentzel, John Jack
son, J. McTierney and N. Winskie.
UXIOX LABOR PICNICS.
Application will be made by the
Stable and Carriage Owners' Associa
tion this forenoon to the Police Com
missioners for license for forty men to
man the hacks that are lying In the
various stables. The association
claims it has all the men needed to
supply the demand and all that Is now
required is the license and badges per
mitting them to take' their places on the
drivers' seats. This action was de
cided on by the executive committee of
the association at a meeting held last
night. It is deemed expedient that, in
asmuch as the men were on hand ready
and willing to go to work, the car
riages should be placed on the streets.
At the urgent request of represen
tatives from the Stablemen's Union
and the Labor Council several con
ferences were held with the executive
committee of the Stable and Car
riage Owners' Association looking to
a compromise over the trouble exist
ing between the two bodies, but noth
ing came out of the conferences, as
the stablemen decided to stand firmly
against the open shop principle as
understood by themselves and the Clt-*
lzens' Alliance, which is pledged to
support the association.
Delegate May of the Butchers'
Union No. 115, who attended the fifth
bi-annual convention of the Amalga
mated Meat Cutters and Butcher
Workmen of North America at Cin
cinnati. Ohio, has returned. It was
resolved to send First International
Vice President C. E. Schmidt to the
Pacific Coast, with headquarters at
San Francisco. The international or
ganization is in a flourishing condi
tion. 29,000 new members having
been added to the roll since the con
vention held at East St. Louis, 111., in
August, 1902. Agreements have been
entered into with all the large pack
ers in this country.
Hacks will be running on the streets
by Tuesday night as they did prior to
the trouble with drivers. The hack
men met last night as representatives
of the union and decided to stand "pat"
on the issue Involved. The stable own
ers are taking the same position, and
as the latter organization is backed
by the Citizens' Alliance, the indica
tions are that there will be all kinds
of hacks with non-union drivers on
the street by Tuesday at midnighft .
When the Hackmens' Union met last
night the question was as to whether
the union should accept the" proposition
advanced by the owners or stand upon
the position that the union had been
locked out and that there was nothing
to consider tfeyond going back to work.
The fact was stated to the members
of the union that the owners intended
to put hacks on the streets on Tues
day, but that statement did not deter
the members of the union from voting
in favor of continuing the strife.
There is sympathy between I the
stablemen and the drivers of hacks
to the extent that each class considers
the other injured. That is demon
strated by the amount of mcrney which
is being- paid into the treasury every
week by the allied interests, but, as one
of the men remarked, the drain is get
ting very irksome. Even though the
union holds out. the hacks will be
running on Tuesday, for the owners
have announced their intention of
carrying that act Into effect.
WILL ASK FOR BADGES.
The Information was given out at
the local offices of the Southern Pa
cific yesterday that Charles W. Eber
lein, acting land agent of the company,
who relieved Jerome Madden some
months ago, will soon give up that po
sition and go to New York, where he
will be assigned to other duties by
President Harriman.
The news has caused considerable
speculation as to who will succeed
Eberlein. None of the local officials
of the Southern Pacific Company pre
tend to know who will be selected for
the position, although it Is generally
supposed that the man will be named
by President Harriman and may come
from the East. From time to time
rumors have been circulated to the
effect that the land office of the Cen
tral Pacific, of which W. H. Mill* la
the agent, and the Southern Pacific
were to be consolidated under the
management of Eberlein and that W.
H. Mills would be retired. A few
weeks ago. however, former General
Manager Kruttschnltt set at rest this
rumor by stating there was no inten
tion of retiring the land agent of the
Central Pacific land department.
' It has since developed that Eberlein
came to this coast with no intention
of remaining and simply assumed the
title/ of "acting" land agent in order
to properly administer the affairs of
the Southern Pacific land department.
He came here specially commissioned
by William D. Cornish, a director of
the Harriman lines, to straighten out
several entanglements existing In the
holdings of the Southern Pacific
Company and to secure a reckoning of
the affairs of the same department of
the Central Pacific Company, in so far
as they pertain to the grants and the
mortgages. This work has been about
completed. Several times lately Eber
lein has stated to his friends his de
termination not to remain here any
longer than he had to. It is no secret
among the railroad officials that his
association with many of them has not
been of 'the pleasant character he had
anticipated when he first came west
on his difficult mission. In the pur
suance of his work Eberlein has fre
quently encountered rebuffs and has
also had some rough experiences with
outsiders who have had dealings with
the Southern Pacific Company through
his office. Naturally he Is glad to re
linquish his duties here for others
which are said to await him In New
York. Following closely on the story
of Eberlein's purposed retirement
th%re has been circulated a rumor that
George H. Andrews, acting land agent
of the Southern Pacific Company in
Portland, has been slated for the posi
tion in the office here.
The board unanimously accepted the
report of the Finance Committee,
which will be sent to print this morn
ing and prepared for the consideration
of the Supervisors. One hundred
copies of the report will be printed
and distributed this evening, when the
taxpayers will have an opportunity to
express their opinion on the work of
the Finance Committee.
It was also resolved that the Au
ditor and Treasurer be t.irected to
keep intact the fund arising from the
payment of taxes protested and un
protested, levied for the construction
of a hospital and schools in the year
1902.
When the report had been read and
submitted by the committee Supervisor
Eoxton complimented Brandenstein on
the way his committee had met the
wants of all applicants, and stated that
the report was a remarkable one. Ho
hinted, however, his opinion that many
of the departments might have been
neglected.
Supervisor Lunstedt wÂ£B the only
member of the board that found any
fault with the budget. But he made
a strong talk in favor of purchasing
loose leaf typewriters to be used In
the County Clerk's office, while the
Finance Committee held that the
"book" system was the better and
safer method of handling reports and
accounts. Lunstedt, however, was so
urgent in his demand that his style of
machine be adopted that it was neces
sary that the question be voted upon
by the board. The vote cast was 10
to 8 in favor of the book system.
Supervisor Braunhart offered a reso
lution that $3000 of the school funds
be segregated for use in maintaining
kindergartens in the school system.
His motion was seconded by Super
visor Alpers and adopted by the board.
WILL INSTRUCT TREASURER.
The sum of $S97,800 was allowed for
the improvements. Of this total $438,
900 will be used by the Board of Public
Works in the improvement of streets
and roads, in the construction of sew
ers and in repairing the water front.
Eighty-five thousand dollars will go to
repairing sewers, and $15,000 to repairs
at the City and County Hospital; $215,
000 is allowed for the cleaning and
sprinkling of streets, $10,000 for sanitary
improvement In Chinatown, $12,000 for
non-sectarian charitable Institutions
and $35,000 to be kept as an urgent
necessity fund. Â¦ .
In Its report to the Supervisors the
committee recommends \hat the aux
iliary water system be installed to re
move the present danger of conflagra
tion. It was also recommended that
the moonlight arc light schedule be
abolished and an increase of $20,000 be
allowed for the Installation of gaa and
electric lights.
COMMITTEE IS COMPLIMENTED.
After having investigated the requi
sitions of the various offices and com
missions of the municipal government,
the Finance Committee met the Board
of Supervisors last night to report its
approved estimates.
Representatives of different Im
provement clubs throughout the city
gathered at the rear of the hall, eager
to hear the result of the committee's
deliberation and the action taken on
matters suggested at last Monday,
morning's public hearing.
Supervisor Brandenstein was elected
chairman in the absence of Mayor
Schmitz. The first business on
hand was the adoption of several reso
lutions of minor importance presented
by the Supervisors. The budget was
next presented for action before its
passage to print. Clerk Fay read the
budget.
The public Improvements recom
mended by the Finance Committee, in
cluding an auxiliary water supply to
be installed on Twin Peaks, for which
$150,000 has been appropriated, were
next read by the clerk.
WILL IMPROVE STREETS.
When Gunther was summoned before j
Judge Fritz to plead he declined to do
so on the ground that he was not rep
resented by counsel. He was given un
til Saturday to arrange for counsel and
to answer the charge. The time may
be extended beyond that date and pos
sibly fixed for June 1.
Gunther was visited yesterday by a/
number of his friends and the matter
of securing bail was talked over. At
4:30 o'clock George Hewlett, a friend,
brought $5000 in coin to the police sta
tion and deposited it for his release.
When Gunther was asked as to what
he intended to do he declined to make
any statement.
The District Attorney's office has all
the facts in the case so far gathered
by the police, and the general opinion
is that Kelly's charge against Gunther
will result in conviction. The formal
ground upon which Gunther is held is
that he violated section 92 of the Penal
Code by attempting to bribe a juror.
The Police Department is confident
that Kelly's story Is correct and that
Gunther received the money from
Wong Fong. ' Every effort has been
made to locate Wong Fong, but thus
far ,he has succeeded In dodging the
police. It is generally thought that he
is either being secreted in Chinatown
or that he has left the city, the latter
being the more common belief.
It is openly charged that the various
tongs that wished to see Nguen Lun go
free raised considerable money for his
defense, and even went so far as to
give "Wong fong $1500 with which to
secure a veraict in favor of the defend
ant. It is also claimed in Chinatown
that Wong Fong gave Gunther $800 to
fix the jury in the case and pocketed
the balance. If that story proves trueâ
and the police believe It willâ it will ex
plain where the money came from
which Kelly says Gunther slipped in
his pocket.
Wong Fong may be in Portland. As
soon as the money was given Gunther,
according to one of the members of the
See Yup society, Wong Fong took the
train for the north in order. to be out
of the Jurisdiction of the court in the
event of any exposure following the at
tempted bribing of the Nguen Lun jury.
FRIENDS VISIT GUXTHEH.
That there might be no question as
to holding the accused to the higher
-court the hearing was had before
Judge Fritz. The same facts which
were presented to Judge Lawlor were
submitted to Judge Fritz and the re-
FUlt was that Gunther was held to the
Grand Jury under 510,000 bond or
$5000 cash bail.
BELIEVE KELLY'S STORY.
David J. Kelly swore out a warrant
yesterday for the arrest of E. W. Gun
ther on the charge of attempted brib
ery, and Gunther occupied a cell in the
City Prison until he was able to fur
nish the $10,000 bond or $5000 cash ball
which Judge Fritz required before the
accused could be released. The coin
was put up at 4:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon by George Hewlett of 1216
Masonic avenue.
Kelly, the juror in the Nguen L.un
murder trial, who accused Gunther of.
trying to bribe him, swore to a for
mal complaint yesterday morning, and
in order that proper service might be
made on the accused, Detective Ryan
took Gunther into the hallway and read
the document to him and at once
placed him under arrest. Gunther had
been held on an order of the court.
Judge Lawlor presiding, but in order to
get the matter of record and within the
jurisdiction of the District Attorney's
office it was necessary to have the
warrant served in the regular way.
Kelly's affidavit sets forth the fact
that Gunther endeavored, by money,
to influence his opinion in the render-
Ing of a verdict in the trial of Nguen
Lun, who is charged with murder. The
circumstances surrounding the offering
of the money and the final placing of
the same in the affiant's pocket are all
recited in the affidavit.

New Potatoes continued to arrive freely from
the river districts and from acrosd the bay, and,
although trade was active, the market had an
easy tone, with only a few well-known brands
of strictly fancy stock . bringing the top quota

was being forced for sale nt unsteady rates.
Red Onions were ecsler owing to the lack of
demand for shipping. .Green were scarce and
The market was liberally supplied with mis
cellaneous vegetables and prices of most kinds
had a downward tendency.. Asparagus, and
Peas from across the bay were easier, as the
train with fresh supplies did not arrive until
late. The canners were paying 4#5e per pound

The situatlon-'ts etill more unsatisfactory
for the raiser and seller. Beef, Mutton and
Lamb are plentiful and weak and Steers are
a fraction lower again. The market is glutted
with Calves, and Lambs, especially those from
the river, are coming In poor , and light in
weight owing to the overflowing- of the grazing
lands there. Hogs. too. are coming In more
freely than warranted by the demand and are
weak In consequence. , . i

CHICAGO. May 26.â Nervous su?pense char
acterized wheat trading to-day as a result ol
uncertainty concerning what might be done re
garding supposed open trades of John W.
Kauffman. suddenly deceased. In consequence
business was restricted !^ volume and price
changes were narrow Opening sales of July
were %c to He higher at S > J>,feÂ«rsÂ«>ic. but as
the sesflon advanced speculative trading was
affected by tho signs of weakness in cash mar-
Kf-ts throughout the country. Primary receipts
wer-? much larger and a crop report issued
at Cincinnati was ijuite bearish. Trade w;>.s
very light. The market closed firm, with July
up <ic at B614C. after the price had touched
S<;',4c. May ranged between 95V&C and l)7c,
closing B7%c.
The onsettled weather and contending claims
as to '-he probable near future made trading
in torn rather hazardous and business was
very light. July closed at 4S%c. a gain of %c.
Tho monotonous dullness of trading in oth.T
V rains- was relieved to a considerable extent
fry tho activity in oats. July closed *ic hlgli
â¢r at 3Nvic
Covering by Â«horts marked tlie trading in
r-rovliiinns. Small receipts of hogs and higher
rrices at the yards were the incentives. The
market closed at about the . highest point cf
tht day. with July pork up 20cj lard was up
12'/4c and ribs were 10c higher.

arrived from Hermoslllo, Mexico, but had not
been sold up to a late hour. Oranges were
dull and prices had a wide range as to size.
Lemons and Limes moved freely at steady
rates.
Receipts of Cherries were about 2100 boxes,
several hundred less than on the preceding day,
but as there was an abundance of cariied
over stock and very little demand for shipping
the market was weak. ' The top quotation for
Black In drawers was obtained only for occa
sional lots, Â»J5c being the top for the general
market. Choice lots of loose sold in preference
to the packed stock, while poorly colored and
small dragged at unsteady rates. The white
varieties were neglected by the regular traÂ»ie
and the canners secured a considerable quan
tity at 2H@3ViC per pound. The market closed
very weak, with a heavy surplus still unsold.
Receipts of .Strawberries were a little In ex
cess ot 1200 chests, of which about 1000 were
of the largo varieties from the Watsonvllle re
gion. The arrivals of Longworths still showed
the effects of. the hot weather in the interior,
being moro or less sunburnt, but cleaned up
nevertheless. The canners were still in the
market for the large varieties and secured large
lines at the minimum quotation. Raspberries
from the south sold at 15Â«J20c per basket and
Dewberries brought 7 1 ,4c. Gooseberries and
Currants were very dull.

The last of the exhibits for the San
Francisco building at the St. Louis
Exposition are about to be forwarded.
Some of them, just ' completed, are
unique. Among the list are a great
hemisphere, a topographical map of
San Francisco, scores of photographs,
statistical tables and illuminated
charts, illustrations of many phases of
life in San Francisco and works of
art. ;"
There will be in and on the build
ing a display of flags and city seals
that will largely advertise San Fran
cisco. The seals are three in number.
They will be in the reception romn in
the center of the San Francisco struc
ture. Robert T. Aitken has taken the
city seal as a model for the seals to
be used at St. Louis, but has brought
out the artistic possibilities more clear
ly. The designs will be in plaster,
three feet in diameter, and will be
bronzed. In the interior of the San
Francisco building three dozen small
flags of this city will be used decorat
ively, each being two by three feet in
size. One San Francisco flasr, nine feet
long, will hang over the main entrance
and four San Francisco flags, each
four by six feet, will be on the corners
of the exterior. With national and
State flags the display of bunting will
be very gay.
.MORE EXHIBITS READY.
Just before the excursion reached
St. Louis resolutions were adopted in
which Secretary Fletcher, the board
and the Union Pacific, Southern Pa
cific and Burlington lines were thank
ed for good service and accommoda
tions.
Manager Briggs of the California
State Board of Trade yesterday re
ceived a letter from J. A. Filcher. Cal
ifornia commissioner to the St. Louis
Exposition, relative to the board's ex
cursion, some parts of which are as
follows:
I wish to aay to you and through you to
the board that I think that your excursion,
although a little early in view of conditions
here, was a very timely and thoughtful move.
The parties who participated were representa
tive people. The more representative Callfor
nlana who are sent here to spread the gospel of
the State's glory and advantages the better
for California. Much good will come to the
State from this excursion, as all the excur
sionists will emphasize the stories that we
are telling- of the benefits which come through
residence and Investment in our State. The
California fever is abroad in the land. â¢Â¦ \\>
are confronted with It daily. I think it would
be wise, predicating the action on the success
of the board's initial excursion, to announce
immediately another excursion at a later date,
when everything at the exposition will be In
good shape, the attendance larger and the op
portunities for exploiting California propor
tionately better. Mr. Wiggins and myself and
the entire California colony agree that benefit
must come from this effort on your part. All
wli3 came speak of the delightful trip across
the continent and of the pleasure of being
here 1 am sure that those who may come
later under similar advantages will be simi
larly pleased.
GOOD WILL RESULT.
For instance, on the day that Texas
had a reception there were five per
sons in the California building to one
in that of Texas, although there was
nothing but the ordinary routine' in
the California structure. California's
forestry exhibit is also pronounced by
Secretary Fletcher to be fine. He is
of the opinion that this State will gain
large advertising from its display at
St. Louis and that the trip of the busi
ness men of California was beneficial.
1*. M. Fletcher, secretary of the
California State Board of Trade, re
turned yesterday from St. Louis. He
escorted the board's excursion party
of California business men and their
families to the exposition. According
to his version the California hortlciil
\ural and agricultural exhibits are by
far the finest in their line to be seen
on the exposition grounds, and the
California building attracts more at
tention than*any other State structure.

The committee finds the report of -Dr. D. F.

all of the dairy buildings In a most dilap

and in many cases even dangerous to life.
The worst part of the barn is given up to
the cows. The cow barn is poorly ventilated
and almost without light. In most instances
the udder* of the cows were covered with dirt.
The condition of the milkers was frightful,
they wearing the filthiest of clothes, and the
stools upon which they sat were unrecog
nizable from incrustations. Under the con

The work of Inspecting the dairies in the
counties supplying milk to San Francisco will

the board may be placed in possession of the
facts relating to all the dairies supplying milk
to San Francisco. Under section S, ordinance
No. 32S of the Board of Supervisors the
Board of Health fcaa power and authority to

which proves to bÂ« an Imminent menace or
danger to health or life and certainly the
condition of the dairies of San Francisco is of
such character, and if steps are not begrm

Health Officer Ragan yesterday sub

port regarding the sanitary conditions
of sixty-seven dairies which he and his
inspectors investigated during the last

tary condition of fifteen dairies is very
poor, that of thirty-four is poor and of
eighteen fair. The milk of fifty-one
dairies was found good In quality as
regards butter fat, and sixteen dairies
had poor milk. The condition of cows
and the feed supply was all good but
one, and the water supply was good in
all dairies. Dr. Ragan's report says:

"The best place for fellows of
your kind is at the end of a rope." was
one of the things said by judge Mogan
to H. M. Leland, charged with vag
rancy, battery and disturbing the
peace. Then his Honor informed Mr.
Leland that to-day he will be sentenced
to the full penalty for each of his three
offenses, which means that he will be
sent to the County Jail for fifteen
months.
Leland was arrested last Sunday
morning for beating his young wife in
a saloon at Jackson and Kearny
streets. The woman testified that since
she married him last January she has
been compelled to support him, and
that when she received a summons,
accompanied by a railroad ticket, to
return to her parents at Santa Maria
the fellow insisted that she remain
with him. She ran away from him,
and when pursued she sought refuge
in the saloon where he assaulted her.
After slashing her with a knife he
struck her upon the head with a bottle,
and when she fell as a result of the
blow he kicked her.
The woman was an unsophisticated
William Yakowski, a carpenter, did
all the plumbing needed in the renova
tion of a flat at 913 Folsom street, and
Agent Hobro of the Health Board had
him arrested for practicing plumbing
without a license. The work done by
Mr. Yakowski was both unsanitary and
uncouth, Agent Hobro informed Judge
Morgan, and must be torn out. When
the owner of the property, a Mr.
O'Rorke. 1 is brought into court to ex
plain why he. engaged an amateur
plumber the Judge will prescribe Mr.
Yakuwski's punishment.

Miss Mersage and infant live with her
married sister, Mrs. Thomas Black, at
118A Langton street. Halsey resides
with his wife and his mother and is
employed in a Mission-street tile fac
tory.
James F. Halsey. a former deputy
county clerk,' and now a candidate for
appointment as Â¦ a policeman, can
not be compelled by law to
support his illegitimate minor child.
The mother of the babe, Miss
Mamie Mersage, proved its pater
nity pretty thoroughly yesterday to
Judge Cabaniss, but his Honor could
find nothing in the statutes to enable
him to make Halsey contribute to tne
expense of its maintenance, and the
case was dismissed. Mrs. Pettie, agent
of the Universal Service Society, who
is championing the cause of Miss Mer
sage, announced her intention of pros
ecuting Halsey for seduction.
Under the California statutes an il
legitimate child is fatherless. Its male
parent is morally but not legally
obliged to provide for Its Keeping. ,
While he was "keeping company"
with Miss Mersage, and prior to her
maternity, Halsey married another
young woman who a few weeks
later became a mother. Miss
Mersage testified that to- her he
denied being married, and when
she presented him with proofs
to the contrary he promised to obtain
a divorce and make her uis wife just
as soon as he could legally do so. When
her baby was born, however, he de
clared he was not responsible for it.
She proved that he haa registered her
as his wife at a Mission-street hotel.
Judge Mogan gave Mary Hawley four
months' imprisonment for stealing $25
from Albert Oleson while he slumbered
in a Mission street lodging-house, to
which she had escorted him. It was the
woman's third offense of that kind.
The charge of obtaining money by
false pretense against C. E. Hyman
was dismissed by Judge Cabaniss. It
was on May 1 that Hyman obtained
from Dan Cullen, a Sutter street sa
loon-keeper, the sum of 555 by giving
him a check for that amount drawn
upon the Anglo-Californian Bank, with
a request that its presentation for pay
ment be deferred until May 5. On that
date Cullen was informed by the bank
people that they held no funds to Hy
man's credit. Under the law the alle
gation of false pretense was not proved,
as the evidence failed to show that Hy
man did not have funds in the bank'at
the time the check was drawn.
Otto, who is an amateur instrument
alist, resides with his brother Walter at
214 Austin avenue, and it was Walter's
unwarranted use of a cornet belongingto
Otto that led to the latter's crazy con
duct and subsequent arrest. Picking up
a sword cane he chased Walter from
the house and was yelling like an In
dian and wildly brandishing the weap
on behind his fleeing and affrighted
brother when Patrolman Frary stopped
the pursuit on Bush street, near Van
Ness avenue.
Walter opined that Otto is "music
mad," and Otto's demeanor in court
certainly served to justify that opinion.
Judpe Cabaniss remanded the case of
Otto Schultz. carpenter, to the Insanity
Commissioners, as the man showed un
mistakable symptoms of dementia while
ho was in court, and the testimony cf
witnesses indicated that he was of un
sound mind.

While walking along Eddy street
Wednesday evening the complainant
was suddenly assailed by Stephenson,
who struck him on the jaw, while
Harning attacked him from behind. In
court yesterday Schiok professed ina
bility' to. accouift for the assault until
StephenEon stated that one day last
week he inadvertently left a purse
containing $10 upon a counter
in . the Schick drug store, and
that when he returned and looked
for it a few minutes afterward it had
disappeared. Schick then remembered
the incident, and explained that the
purse had been picked up by a cus
tomer, from whom he subsequently ob
tained it under threat of exposure. He
was ready to restore the receptacle and
its contents to Stephenson, but did not
see that individual again until the as
sault took place, and then did not
recognize him.
Judge Mogan has given himself until
June 2 to digest the testimony in the
assault case of G. Schick. a Market
street druggist, against Clifford B. Ste
phenson, photographer, and William A.
Harning, bartender.
Diedrich Schween, a grocer's clerk, was
tacking a sign to an awning at Fourth
and Mission streets when Arthur H.
Armitage annoyed him in some manner
as 'yet unexplained, and Diedrich struck
him upon the head with a hatchet,
knocking him down and out. Diedrich
will be sentenced for battery.
