some one was attempting to kill the

lÂ»acy. in ' whose presence the water was
drained from the tank. Nearly a pound
of strychnine was found in the bottom
of the vessel, and the crystals were still
floating on the water when this investi
gation was made. -
The Sheriff kept the strychnine as evi
dence and started an Investigation, call
ing In a private detective to assist him.
The Investigation started early In July
and thus far has resulted only In sus
picions which are not supported by suf
ficient evidence to justify arrests. Thero
were property disputes and financial rea

which until now has been believed to be
thoroughly cleaned up, is certain, for he
has sold some nuggets.' Whether his

In the old mission days It was known
that the; fathers secured treasure from
some point east of San Fernando in; the
bleak; hills- which/ border the canyon.
The tradition. that they buried much of
their, treasure -under, the, walls of the
San -Fernando -Mission has ' caused the
walls v of ;that*stately,pile; to be honey
combed until 'the "' mission Is almost a
complete :,wreck.; If any gold treasure
has .been i found ''there the : secret , has
been well \ guarded, ibut ' it is '; commonly
believed, that the discovery of this gold
formed" theibaslsj for; the -rich' Leonis

courts for decades.
SANTA ANA. Aug. 10.â Officers to-day
gave out the details of a diabolical at
tempt on . June 24 last to put an end by
wholesale strychnine poisoning to Mrs.
John Bushard, , her three children and
Joseph Kaegerer, a ranch hand, all ot
whom live on the old Bushard ranch, a
half mile south of the village of Talbert.
On the day in question all the members
of " the household were at Huntington
Beach, and their would-be ; poisoner evi
dently took advantage of their absence
to carry out the plot for their destruc
tion. Kaegerer upon his return drew
a drink of water from the tank which
furnishes \u25a0 the . ranch house, but . noticing
a peculiarly bitter taste about It, drank
only a small portion. \
The unusual taste so aroused his sus
picions'that, in spite of the fact that the
others made, light of "his apprehensions,
he insisted upon Investigation." Water
from the ; tank . was sent here the next
morning |f for. analysis, and was found to

THAT WAS LOST
IN EARLY DAYS
Mr. de Wltte and Baron Rosen had
yesterday, accepted an invitation to
dine with Assistant Secretary of State
Peirce and in spite of their arduous
labors at the navy yard to-day they
kept their engagement. At 9 o'clock
upon their, return to their quarters in
the hotel, they / plunged again into
work and the . lights in their rooms
burned until long after midnight.
Much excitement prevailed about the
hotel,, the corridors of which were
thronged with summer guests and
newspaper correspondents, all discuss
ing and speculating upon the terms
while off the corridors dozens of tele
graph instruments were clicking off
dispatches to all quarters of the globe
The Russian and Japanese plenipotenti
aries dented themselves to callers no
statements were issued and only to a
few were Japan's conditions known.
The initiative of the decision taken
by the peace conferees to keep In abso
lute secrecy the deliberations was pro
posed by the Japanese representatives
The Russians had no especial intention
of maintaining secrecy, but, thinking
they had not the right of oppostng the
desire of the Japanese, they have con
sented to this proceeding.
The Japanese plenipotentiaries mani
fest not the slightest annoyance at the
prospect of a few/days' delay. They
realize how serious the issue is and are
perfectly willing to give their Russian
colleagues ample time for considera
tion.
contending that they only represent
fair compensation for the expenses of
the war and the victories they have
achieved on land and sea, their sole
purpose being to attain the objects for
which they have fought and the spoils
claimed being only such as they are
legitimately entitled to as the result
of their artillery and naval successes.
The Russian plenipotentiaries, as
soon as the Japanese terms were in
their hands, called five expert delegates
attached to the mission, and spent the
whole afternoon in th-e consideration of
the terms. Meantime the conditions
had been placed in cipher and cabled to
the Czar, with Mr. de Witte's personal
explanations. It Is h6ped that a reply
will be received from the Emperor to
morrow, ,in which -case Mr. de Witte
expects to have the Russian response
ready by Saturday, but it is not un
likely that. Saturday being the first an
niversary of the birth of the Czarevitch,
the presentation of the reply will be de
ferred until Monday. Meantime the
envoys will not meet unless some un
expected necessity for a conference
should arise.
The Japanese, on the . contrary, as
Baron Komura announced at the con
ference to-day, consider them moderate,
Japan does not mention the amount of
indemnity she will demand, but insists
on the recognition of the principle of In
demnity.
As a whole these terms are regarded as
exceedingly harsh in the eyes of the Rus
sians. In addition to the two principal
conditions, which cannot 'be accepted
under Mr. de Witte's Instructions, there
are clauses relating to the curtailment
of .Russian naval power in the Far East
and the granting of llshing rights upon
the Russian littoral. These are consid
ered particularly, offensive to the amour
propre of their, country and of such a
humiliating character as to be Inadmis
sible. - .
Japan, In the terms which she sub
mitted to-day, will require the cession
of territory. Saghalien Island is certain
ly part of the territory that will be de
manded. The demand may be in excess
of this, because the Japanese have found
a foothold on the coast of Siberia, near
the mouth of the Amur River, and even
now they may have the Japanese flag
over Kamchatka.
Japan has provided that she will no
longer have an antagonist in Russia on
the mainland or on the Sea cf Japan.
Thus far the moves on the chess board
have been merely fencing. Now will
come the real struggle. The situation
here la that even the Russian envoys do
not know what will be done. This is due
to the situation in Russia. Everything
might be upset in a night. lam inform
ed that, in case the money indemnity
agreed on is moderate, arrangements are
practically completed to have the money
furnished by capitalists in New York,
London and Paris. - -
That Japan shall be the recognized
predominant power in the Far East is
the elst of the entire document pre
sented by Baron Koniura to Mr. de
YVHte to-day, no matter how deviously
the wording: may be expressed. Unr
lnjg the stay of the Japanese party here
the clear Intention of the Mikado's Gov
ernment to become the great power ami
to rule In time, not only Korea and
Manchuria, but all of China, was made
so evident that there could be no doubt
that* it was on this great mission that
the Japanese envoys had come to Ports
mouth.
Cession and indemnity are the ques
tion* In doubt. As to all elÂ»e. there
probably -will be no serious objection
by Russia. The Government Is ready
to relinquish Manchuria and Japan will
be a fixture on the mainland and will
be allowed to extend her empire west
ward and southward.
The territory to be ceded is of course
the barren island of Saghalien, now used
by Russia as a penal colony. The < recog
nition of the principle of indemnity may
mean the cost of the war, or it may mean
that the Eastern Chinese Railway, the
right and property of whicn are to go to
Japan, may count as indemnity. This
road cost its builders more than $200,000,
000. I do not understand -that the future
of Vladivostok was mentioned in . the
terms.
PORTSMOUTH, N. H. f Aug. 10.âJap
an's peace terms require the cession of
territory, the recognition of the principle
of a money Indemnity, the retirement of
Russian influence from all of Manchuria,
the cession to Japan of Port Arthur and
the Eastern Chinese Railway and the
"independence" of Korea, under Jap

INDEMNITY THE GREAT ISSUE
Finally on thÂ« sixth day. Head Keeper
Ruland returned to the tower and
Coster was overpowered and taken to
Port JefterÃon.
Then the maniac's delirium took an
other turn and he endeavored to kill
Hulse and himself. He attacked Hulse,
but was beaten off. after which he
backed his own throat with the razor,
Inflicting gash after gash, from which
blood poured until the apartment was
covered with It. His wounds were not
serious, however, and the following day
he stabbed himself with a heavy pocket
knife.
One night the maniac tried to put
out the light and did stop it from re
volving. After a desperate struggle
Hulse finally threw Coster down the
stairway leading to the light tower and
started the light going again.
The wild man then obtained a razor,
and, lashing the blade to the handle,
started out in search of Imaginary
enemies. When Hulse saw him next.
Cotter was hard at work with hammer
and chisel, endeavoring to take bricks
from the tide of the tower. He told
Jiulse his foes were pursuing him and
â¢were hidden in the brick sides of the
lighthouse.
To-day Coster made up his mind that
he would stop the light and went up
end stopped the revolving lenses.
Hulse fought with Coster in the nar
row light tower and succeeded in
throwing him out of that portion of
the tower.
Coster, armed with a razor, tried to
kill Hulse and himself. Overpowered
efter an all-day battle, the madman
finally desisted.
Stratford Shoals light is on Long
Island Sound, midway between this
harbor and Bridgeport. It is a lonely
spot at all times, and when Julius
Coster, the second assistant keeper, re
turned from a few days' absence, a
raving maniac as the result of too
much drink, the tiny rock became a
bedlam.

. SALT LAKE,. Aug. 10.â Samuel Grice, a
convicted burglar, who won the Victoria
cross by his bravery in going to the as
sistance of Lord Roberts during an ac
tion in Afghanistan in 1877, to-day began
to serve a twelve-year sentence in the
Utah State prison. Grice has lived in
Salt Lake' for several years and has be
come notorious for his petty crimes and
for his skill in evading punishment. - He
has often received jail sentences, but
until now has not been convicted of a
crime that would justify a long impris
onment. â¢
Grice enlisted in the British army in
1867 and served seventeen years. He saw
sfrvice in India, South Africa and Egypt,
where he was woutided during the Soudan
campaign. He won the cross in 1877 by
hurrying to the aid of Lord Roberts, who
had been unhorsed and slightly wounded
in the action at Khost. With the assist
ance of a soldier from another regiment.
Grice succeeded in taking the general to
safety.
Grice also served under Colonel Ed

who was decorated for service at Gin

his only -wound. Grjce. is . now almost
sixty years old and does not expect to

Stricken Southern City
NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 10. â The offi
cial report up to -6 o'clock p. m. on the
yellow fever situation is as follows:
Xew casts, 68; "total to date, 747.
Deaths, 5; total to date, 124. New sub
foci. 21; total to date, 151. ,\ Cases under
treatment, 256.
With the death-rate remaining lower
than in previous visitations of the fe
ver, the .feeling here both among the
health authorities and the laity con
tinues hopeful. The fever has been
prevalent long enough to have assumed
a virulent form, but instead, it is ap
parently less malignant than it was
when it first appeared.
Many of the cases which are now
being reported, except among the Ital
ians, are mild in character and readily
respond to the treatment given them.
Dr. White said to-day that while the
work of organizing his forces is rapid
ly crystallizing, he will not be able to
make any announcement of the details
of the campaign until Sunday. One of
of the details of the plan, it is under
stood, will be an Inspection, not only
of every house, but of every room in
the city. In connection with. his work,
Dr. White took occasion to-day to say
that he had encountered less interfer
ence from politicians in New 'Orleans
than he had ever met with before.
One of the curious incidents of the
day was an incipient strike . of em-,
ployes of the Citizens' Sanitary De
partment. It occurred in the Thir
teenth Ward. Heretofore there have
been as "many men applying for jobs
as could, be taken care of. They were
glad to work for $150 a day. The
Thirteenth Ward force, however, be
lieved if was entitled, to a raise. The
employes struck for $:>. The citizen's'
\u25a0pommittee- refused to pay more and a
new force was engaged.
\ The City. Council at its meeting to
?day authorized Mayor -Behrman to bor
row $60,000 from financial agents to
assist in meeting the present emer
gency. Ten thousand dollars is to be
used in carrying on the "street cleaning
work, in which the city is engaged, and
the $50,000 is to go to the fund asked
by'the Government. Though not quite
$250,000 has been raised, air the money
Is available that can be' used, by v Dr.
and his force for six- weeks.
Owing to the difficulties: it has met
.with at Mobile after being,. forced to
divert its ships from New Orleans, the
United ' Fruit Company, \it is learned,
has decided temporarily to discontinue
Its business. Two more steamships are
now completing cargoes there and will
bring them to New Orleans.
- There are twenty-seven cases of fever
at Patterson, La., but nearly all of them
\u25a0have been"previously announced. Bon

-. -PARIS, Aug. 10. â The statement that
German bankers have advanced a per
sonal loan of $2,500,000 to the Sultan of
Morocco, although not confirmed of
ficially, is arousing indignant comment,
coming after assurances that the status
quo was to remain unaffected until the
holding of the international conference.
It is pointed put that the legality of
the loan is contestable, the position of
the Sultan since the last International
conference being similar to that of the
Khedive of Egypt (who reigned- from
1563 to 1879) at the period when the
powers Intervened for the regulation
of Egyptian finances, in order' to pre
vent the personal extravagance of the
Khedive. : ; ii â¢...-
Meanwhile, Germany has not yet re
plied to the last. French note regarding
the conference. This delay is believed
to be due to Germany submitting the
French proposals to the Sultan before
responding to them.
According to semi-official advises the
Sultan is showing more and more a
marked opposition to the proposed con
ference "and to any consideration ot
Moroccan reforms.
WASHINGTON*, ! Au?, 101â Prof essor
W. L. Moore, chief of the . weather
bureau, to-day issued a signed state
ment denying' allegations of graft in
the management of the weather bureau
station in the Blue Ridge Mountains,
near Blue Mountain; disclaiming the
existence of any irregularities in the
administration of his office and offer
ing full opportunity for the investiga
tion of any specific charges by any
person. He says:
A few days ago a statement was published
in Washington to the ettect that it was re
ported ujiotticially that the Stcrtt Service had
dispatched agents to the mountain station
< Mount Weather of the United States Weather
Bureau),, wh=re the sleuths tor the past two
days nave been nosinc around.
According to the report, these sleuths dis
covered that the Weather Bureau was pay
ing $3 per day for unskilled labor, which is
twice the amount paid laborers In thÂ« city
of Washington, and that there is a complaint
on the part of the employers adjacent who
only pay "3 cents to $1.
It is a fact that the Weather Bureau has
never paid $3 a day to *ny laborer employed
at Mount Wtather or at any other place, and
If the reporter who wrote that statement had
taken the trouble to ask for the privilege of
examining the pay rolls of the Weather Bu
reau h-e would have saved his readers the op
portunity of reading secretly secured scandal
instead oÂ£ openly procured news. I would
like to have the entire pay rolls of Mount
Weather, or of any other portion of the Weath
er Bureau, published, so that the public may
know whether there is an extravagant man
agement inside of the bureau or any falsi
fication.
I do not doubt that T have disturbed the
labor market In the vicinity of Mount Weather
and I am proud of the fact, for I was told
of men working from sunrise to sunset for
50 cents per day and board, or 75 cents per
day and board themselves. I believe that such
hours of labor and such wages do not con
tribute to the betterment of American citizen
ship or the welfare of the State and so far
as I have the power, as the chief of a largs
Government bureau. I shall ever strive to alter
such conditions.
Having gained important concessions
from the riouthi-rn i'acilic Company la
the- way of an interchange of truttio
privileges in Southern California, me
San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt LakÂ«
road is now preparing to obtain similar
privilege* f rom the Santa Fe roud ia
the same territory. Yesterday the offi
cials of the Wanta Fe Company received
a formal request from the otfici.ila of
the Salt Lake road for v conference
here next weeK, at which the question
of an interchange of traffic will be
thoroughly discussed.
As yet the exact date for the cor.fer
ence has not been decided, but the traf
fic Oifieial3 of the Santa Fe have an
nounced their willingness to confer and
left the date of the meeting to the repre
sentatives of the other road. Upon what
basis the Salt Lake road officials hope
to secure an agreement with the Santa
Fe for interchange of traffic In South
ern California is not known hero, but it
is presumed that they will ask th^ priv
ilege of reaching direct all the indus
trial points on the Santa Fe line in the
lower section of the State. A conces
sion of this character will largely de
terininÂ»} on what kind of reciprocity the *
Salt Lake road proposes to offer. It is
doubtful, however, if any trouble will
ensue over the question, for the two
roads are very friendly.
United States Senator Clark is a good
patron of the Santa Fe road. He has a
coal mine at Gallup that contributes
largely to the freight income ot the Santa
Fe Company, and still more important
business is done with the company at Je
rome, where his big United Verde cop
per properties consign their product to
the cars of the Santa Fe for shipment to
the markets. Naturally, in view of thesÂ»e
friendly relations, the officials of the
Santa Fe are anxious to be extremely
fair with the Salt Lake people, and
will ' most likedy agree upon an inter
change of freight if the Clark people
can give some reasonable assurance that
whatever sacrifice ia made by the Santa.
Fe will be met with a liberal concession
of privileges along the line of the Salt
Lake route.
The Santa Fe now enjoys trackage
privileges over the Salt Lake Company's
line between Pasadena and San Pedro,
which it secured several years a?o.
when that portion of the Salt Lake Com
pany's tracks was owned by the Los
Angeles. Terminal Company. This agree
ment -nrill m no way be affected by tho
coming conference.

At the Guildhall,' which was reached
at about 1 o'clock, the Lord Mayor and

LONDON, Aug. 10.-Vice Admiral Cail
lard, commander-in-chief of the French
fleet, and eight of his officers arrived in
London this afternoon. The weather was
ideal and animated crowds thronged the
route from the Victoria station through
the main streets to Guildhall, where
the visitors were guests of the Lord
Mayor anu Corporation at \u25a0 luncheon.
Forty open carriages conveyed the offi
cers and the procession was headed by
three royal coaches bearing Admiral

mirals, Sir Francis Bertie, the British
Emba?sador to France, and Paul Cam
bon, the French Embassador to Great
Britain.
Mrs. Green secured a divorce from her
husband a little over a year ago. Since
then she has had a hard time to secure
a livelihood for herself and child. Sick
ness brought on her melancholia and
brought about the attempt at self-de
struction. â¢
At the Central Emergency Hospital Dr.
Reuben C. Hill operated the stomach
pump with such vigor that Mrs. Green
was able to think rationally in a com
paratively short space of time. She de
plored her rash action, and buoyed up by
the kind words and goodly advice of Dr.
Hill, went home with a promise never to
repeat the act, but to live for her little
girl, who is yet in her infancy.
Mrs. Myrtle Green, a divorced woman
living 'at 278 Clara street; toyed with
Death "for a moment last night, but failed
to get on speaking terms with the grim
destroyer. Rat poison was the agent em
ployed. Despondency is ascribed as the
cause. Owing to the prompt action of
Mrs. E. C. Belmont, with whom Mrs.
Green was living, the latter's life was
saved, but not until after a desperate
fight between the woman who would take
her own life and Mrs. Belmont.
The Belmonts were- at supper when Mrs.
Green, a frail woman, bent with care,
appeared on the threshold of the dining
room door, holding in her hand a spoon
ful of rat poison. Placing it near her
lips, she said: "Good-by, Annie. This
life is too hard for me. Look out for
little Grade. God protect her." Hardly
had she done speaking, when Mrs. Bel
mont reached her side with a. bound. Mrs.
Green made a desperate attempt to swal
low the poison. In the light a quantity
of the powder slipped on the floor.
Wrenching her hand free, the frantic
woman tossed off the remaining part of
the powder and sank to the floor in a
swoon.
"I am deeply shocked and grieved at
the death of my beloved friend, Arch
bishop Chapelle. His death is ono of the
most lamentable losses in the course of
the outbreak of fever in New Orleans
which is causing such sympathy and
concern throughout the nation."
NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 10.â In order I
that no unnecessary risks might be taken
it was announced to-day both by Sur- !
gcon White and by Father Scotti that
the funeral of the late Archbishop Cha
pelle, which will take place on Satur
day at 9 o'clock in the morning, would
be private. Dr. White said it was a fact
accepted by the scientists . that yellow
fever could not be transmitted by a corpse,
but it is considered that there would be
some element of danger in attracting to
the cathedral on immense assemblage of
people from all sections of the city. The
cathedral is located within the originally
infected district within a stone's throw of
the French market and there has been
fever on all sides of it.
To-day a solemn requiem mass was
raid in honor of the dead Archbishop.
The services lasted for two hours with a
large attendance of people residing on
the lower side of Canal street. Thirty
priests participated and the church was
profusely decorated in white,' black and
purple. The body rested on a bier in the
main aisle and it was found that the re
mains were sufficiently preserved to per
mit the removal of the metallic cover
ing. Many viewed the remains through j
the glass. After the services ended and
the congregation was dismissed, further
visit* to the church were discouraged. <
During the day. Cardinal Gibbons tel- ;
egraphed his condolence. Messages came j
from all parts of the United States and
from forHsrn countries. :
WILKESBABRE, Pa.. Aug. 10.â Cardi- [
nal Gibbons was informed of the death
of Archbishop Chapelle when he arrived i
in this city last night. He said: I
"The news is a great shock to me. Be- ( i
fore leaving Baltimore yesterday morn

mending himself to my prayers and this j
was the first knowledge I had that his

was near. I need not say how greatly
I am shocked and grieved at the news .
of his death."

NEW YORK. Aug. 10.â A cablegram
was deliveied at the office of the Ziegler

i. mpts northward by the present expedi

scientific wGrk, howtver, was successfully

'"Our rescue was due to the splendid
efforts of William tf. Champ, secretary
cf the late William Ziegler, commanding
â¢-lie relief expedition, who, owing to the
terrible weather, failed to reach us last
year, and to the untiring; zeal of Captain
2\jetdsen and his Norwegian officers and

went to the relief of the Fia^a-Ziegler

Higgins'said his information was that
accused was not ill and he wished that
an opportunity would be given to have
Collins "examined by two physicians.
Collins had been working all the previ
ous day and the police were convinced he
was not ill. A person could easily
feign sickness so that the best physi
cians would be deceived. He would like,
he said, to have two physicians make an
examination of Collins. Of course this
When the case was resumed this morn
ing by Judge Lampman, his counsel H.
D. Helmcken, produced a certificate from
Dr. R. L. Frash, a well known local
practitioner, which stated that he had ex
amined Collins and had found him to
be threatened with a nervous break
down.
. "I shall to-morrow insist that Collins
be examined by two physicians as to his
condition. We are confident he is sham
ming illness. The fact of the matter is
he has played his last card and lost.
He has exhausted all the arts of the
professional juggler in legal' technicali
ties and has, so to speak, got to the end
of his rope. He -is afraid . to take the
stand and give evidence. Lest he should
try to escape from the police the guards
have been doubled. Judge Lampman will
sur?ly commit him. If he applies for
habeas corpus before a Judge of the
Supreme Court he can hardly hope for
success, as two Supreme Court Judge 3
have already turned him down. About
the only thing left open to him is toy
apply to the full court. But I think he
has completely exhausted himself."
VICTORIA. B. C. Aug. 10.â George D.
Collins of San Francisco, who is fighting
extradition on a charge of perjury. Is be
lieved by the police and lawyers engaged
in the case to be feigning illness in a
hopeless endearor to postpone the hour
when he will be handed over to the Cali
fornia authorities. To a Call represen
tative Attorney Higgins said to-night:
Major Taggart took the stand at 3
o'clock. In answer to questions by At
torney Sterling, Major Taggart gave a
detailed account of his army career. He
recited his triumphs in the army and tolc?
of his important commands, and of the
commendations he received. He told of
his service in Cuba and of having been
on the San Juan firing line for two days.
Taggarfs testimony was lacking in sen
sational features.
"But we're not through with you yet.
This gentleman may never again after
this trial see the light of the outside
worJd,"'said Smyser.
Judge Easton called a recess and May
ber stepped from the stand.
Â»"You may be wanted to-morrow and
you may not," said Judge Easton, as
Mayber stepped down into the crowd.
Mrs. Tagpart then shouted her threat
at the detective.
"Humph. Did try it onceâ gov " left,"
said Mayber, from the stand, so that all
could hear.
"We knew all about, this evidence that
is to be given by this man and for two
hours yesterday afternoon I debated
with my client as to the advisability of
letting him go ahead, for the perjury
charge that is to come."
"Is that so?" chimed in Mayber.
"Why can't you have him" arrested"'
asked Sterling.

WE KNOW, Mr. Reader, that you are thinking of getting your next suit
of us, otherwise you would not be interested in reading this advertise-
ment.
Now don't think that these are like the $10 suits you have seen before, sold at this
price. Don't judge these suits by their sale price. Look at their value and consider the
method by which they are sold. Picture in your mind the $15 suits you see about town
â those are the suits we sell for 5 10.
We manufacture clothing and wholesale it to the trade all over the United States
except in California. Here we sell direct to the public through our own stores, but the (
prices are the same as we ask the dealer when he calls at our manufacturing establishment.
We retail here in San Francisco at wholesale prices. You see, we make our profit on the
manufacture of the suit and not on the retailing of it.
Other local dealers buy from manufacturers and then add their profit to that of the manufactur-
ers. The suit reaches you plus two profitsâ the manufacturer's and the retailer's. Our suit reaches
you plus but one profit. The suit you see elsewhere for $15 is the suit we sell for $10.
This one profit principle has made two stores necessary to handle our fast-growing business.
The proof of all this rests with the suit itself. Come in one of our stores â buy a suitâ examine
it carefully at home. If it is not as good as the $15 suit sold elsewhere, return the garment and get
your money back.
If you want a good pair of pants at a medium price, for everyday wear, just to tone up that
worn coat and vest, we have them from ?li.-Â«"> up to $4.00 a pair.

He said there was to be an eruption
of Mount Hood, which should cover the
face of the earth with boiling water.
A swarm of yellow jackets were especi
ally mentioned as having been chosen to
put the finishing touches to such of the
wicked as escaped the cataracts of boil
ing water.
HOOD RIVER, Ore., Aug. 10.â A lurid
glare from a blazing forest last night
led many to believe that the eruption pre
dicted by Daniel II was at hand. A
few of the credulous gathered at the
boat landing early this morning and
crossed to the north bank. Word from
White Salmon yesterday stated that the
white haired prophet, with his little
band of followers, were camped on the
high promontory overlooking Hood Riv
er Valley and Mount Hood. They could
be heard praying half a mile distant.
All day Daniel II stood perched on a
pinnacle, his disciples grouped about him
and the ark ready for the torrent of hot
water that was to engulf the earth and
confuse the wicked.
No other water application of such
magnitude was ever before undertaken in
the Klondike. The big water grants from
Twelve Mile River, made to Acklen peo
ple, call for separate grants of from five
to ten thousand inches aggregating no
more than is asked for by the Palmers in
the present application.
The Palmers want the water In more
than one way. They posted notice of an
application for 3000 Inches of water from
Montana and other creeks of that lo
cality, stating that the water Is wanted
for the Ensel concession on Eureka
Creek. Previous to that they obtained
grants for water on other creeks where
they have holdings or interests.

This is one of the most important ap

near Kalama last night. Duke says
he suddenly drew a razor and slashed
himself through an impulse. It is
thought he had* been meditating the
deed for. some time. In fact, he had
been sent by Portland friends to the
woods to give him an opportunity to
get over his despondency.

DESPONDENT' CLERK SLASHES
HIS WINDPIPE WITH A RAZOR
The executive committee of the San
Francisco Republican League met last;
night at headquarters, 636 Market street,
and conferred with leaders representing
the successful league delegations. The
committee received positive and absolute
assurance that every league delegation is
anti-Ruef from start to finish and that
there is not the slightest sign of weak
ness in any part of the line. The -boast
of the grafters that Ruef will be able to
poll down a delegate here and there is
absurd and nonsensical. The facts are ,
that Ruef cannot hold his. own forces In :
line. The Lynch-Kelly delegation of the ;
Twenty-eighth District has already re- I
jected the Ruef programme. In the j
Thirty-third District Ruef loses one vote j
and the anti-Ruef column gains one. ' '
There is not the slightest doubt at Re- j
publican headquarters that the league j
delegations will organize the convention, !
elect the chairman and other officers,- i
select a straightforward, firm and uncom
promising anti-Ruef man for Mayor, and
also select the new County Committee.
Ruef's gang Is already in process of dis
integration. Indications are that his pro
gramme will not receive the open or un
der-coyer Indorsement of 100 delegates.
It is an open question whether the fraud
ulently elected delegations from the
Thirty-second and Thirty-ninth districts
will be seated. At the proper time the i
convention will render a decision in this j
respect. â¢
In the Thirty-eighth District Byron
Mauzy and J. J. Sullivan were elected
delegates on the league ticket, but their
names were not printed on the tally I
sheets and in some precincts ballots cast I
in their favor were not tallied to their
credit. The error is one that the Election
Commissioners will probably rectify.
Fairfax H. Wheelan, John Lackmann,
David Rich. R. J. Welch, E. J. Bowes,
Daniel A. Ryan and John D. Daly at- '
tended the meeting of the executive com
mittte last night. Supervisor Eggers of
the Thirty-sixth, Jesse E. Marks and Ed
ward Kelly of the Fortieth, CaTy Van
Fleet of the Forty-second, Senator Wolfe
of the Thirty-eighth and other active Re
publicans were at party headquarters.
The 1 executive committee will hold
another session to-morrow night.
Commissioner Scharp said he would
commit the man to the Almshouse. tem
porarily at least.
"May I get my trunk?" Rapelee asked.
He was given permission, ! and for the
first time in the history of West Chester
Almshouse, It received an inmate who
came with a trunk.
"Yes, sir, I most emphatically do. I
want to keep my self-respect and do not
wish to be dependent on relatives or
friends. As I have paid taxes all my life,
I think that now when I have no more
money, it is the duty of the community
to care for me."
Asked how he came to lose his money,
Rapelee said he formerly had been at the
head of a brokerage house in this city,
made a comfortable fortune and retired.
For a time he lived at the best hotels, but
gradually encroached on his capital and
slowly receded to cheaper quarters. The
Income from his funds was insufficient
even then and during the past fifteen
years his capital slowly dwindled until
yesterday only seven cents remained.
When he figured years ago' on always be
ing'in good circumstances, Rapelee said
he never dreamed of living to pass the
four score mark, so his calculations went
far amiss. For two months he has been
living in a boarding-house In New
Rochclle. but yesterday he was told he
would have to move as he was a week
behind in his rent.
NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â Wearing patent
leather shoes, a slightly frayed frock coat
and a high hat which was a bit rusty, J.
T. Rapelee, a retired broker, 82 years of
age, applied yesterday to the Commis
sioner of Charities in New Kochelle for
commitment to the Almshouse. Struck
by the unusual air of dignity and refine
ment, the commissioner asked the aged
applicant to tell his story.
"You don't really mean that you want
to go to the poorhouse?" the commission
er queried.

"All of the jewelry he gathered was
lying on nay dresser in a pile and I sup
pose he was searching for money before
making away with the plunder."
L. Jonas gives practically the same
version of the story as told by his sis
ter and yesterday afternoon he sent for
a physician to attend to her. She was
denied callers late in the day, and the
doctor fears tha nervousness caused by
the affair may result ferlously.
"Oh: The cold chills run down my
back when I think of that horrid gun.
It was pointed right at my head. It was
bo big, and I dared not look around be
cause he appeared a dangerous man. I
heard scurrying feet and saw my burg
lar sprinting along Webster street leav
ing me alone. I went back to the house
and then hurried out to tell the neigh
bors of the affair, but no one seems to
have witnessed the Incident.
"I hurried forward and encountered a
young, well-dressed fellow, wearing a
sack suit and derby hat. He was hiding
In the closet. Before I could question him
as to his right in the house he appeared
with a revolver and ordered me ahead
of him into the street. I was frightened
nearly to a faint. Attempting to scream
when I reached the street. I was unable
to do so, but hurried to the corner with
the robber at my heels and his revolver
at my ear. Afterward I did scream
awfully.
"I went out to a bakery on Post and
L*aguna streets between 3 and 3:30 Wed
nesday." said Miss Jonas as she lay pros
trated, "and distinctly remember locking
the door after me, so you can imagine
my surprise when, on returning, it was
partly open. I thought, at first, father
had returned from his walk, so was not
alarmed, but I bcame alarmed when 1
saw the shadow of a man flit Into my
room.
With Miffs Jonas reside L.. Jonas, a
brother who is a tailor at S2 Third street,
and S. Jonas, her aged father, who made
considerable money in the earfy trade of
San Francisco. None of them were in
the house at the time the burglar is said
to have entered the rooms.
Firemen belonging to Chemical 2, at
1819 Post street, were in front of the
building all afternoon and saw noth
ing of the intruder. The course Miss
Jnnas described as the one the intruder
traversed in his flight would neces
sarily take him by the flrehouse. None
of the others living in the vicinity re
member hearing screams of the woman.
After her scare had partly abated
Miss Jonas informed the police of the
alleged crime, but the efforts of Detec
tive Cottle were unrewarded and the
burglar still remains at large.
On returning from a visit to a
bakery in the vicinity Wednesday
afternoon, says Miss Lena Jonas, a
woman of 35 years, who lives with her
brother and aged father, she encoun
tered a daring burglar In her apart
ments and was forced to walk out of
the house at the point of a revolver,
while he made good his escape. She
avers a pile of the family jewelry was
collected by the thief and left on the
dresser in her room, he being fright
ened into forgetting the booty.
Although many of the neighbors and
residents on the street were in sight
of the Jonas home at the time the af
fair is said to have occurred, no one
has been found who saw the screaming
woman run from the house or the bur
glar sprinjing down the Ftreet. J. N.
Bean, sexton of the Plymouth Congre
gational Church, was standing in front
of the church, next to 1778 Post street,
between 3 and 3:30 o'clock, but he
saw no one leaving the place.
Frightened until she is sick abed,
Miss Lena Jonas told yesterday a re
markable tale of a daylight burglary
which look place in her apartments at
1778 Post street Wednesday afternoon,
when she was driven from the house by
an intruder, who had a pistol, and who
told her not to scream or she would
be killed.

The restoration of the stomach to found

the nerves are quiet and strong, the ap-
petite healthful, the sleep restful, the eye

Every station along the iine fom Jersey

cheered the President heartily. The

Cardinal Gibbons followed. He said:
Mr. President, Friends and Fellow-Citi

grateful to the President of trie United States

emphasized by the consideration that his vl<?lt

the olive branch of peace and good win to

a potent factor In cementing the good rela

I believe In the efficacy of the man himself

happiness and greatness. No man can be a
good citizen, can deserve the respect of his
fellows, unless first of all he ls a good
man in his own family, unless he does his
duty faithfully by his wife and children
I strongly believe in trades unions wisely
and Justly handled. In which the rightful pur

not accomrwinied by a desire to do Injustice
or wrong to others. I believe in the duty
of capitalist and wage-;worker to try to seek

point of view, and to endeavor to show broad
and kindly human sympathy one with tha

"There is one discouraging feature con
nÂ«cted with the upward tendency of the wage
scale among tha workmen of this country.
The higher the wages, the more money they
spend In saloons. The shorter the hours, the
more they are inclined to absent themselves
from home. An apparent disregard for family
ties is growing among the poorer classes, which
will e\entually lead to a disregard for the
blessings our country affords them. Hence,
with an Increase of wages a corresponding
movement for better manhood, nobler citizen
ship and truer Christianity should be set on
foot. The dignity of labor should be main
tained, which can be done only through tha
love that a man should have for his work,
and through the intelligence which he puts
Into it. A steady hand and sober mirid are
necessary for this. Hence, the necessity of
the temperance cause and of the efforts which
organized abstainers are putting into the
movement."
Now. my friends, I want to read you- as

from a Catholic priest whom 1 know well
and whom I know to bo as stanch a friend

oftenâ lt is a good thing for all of us to hear
what Is not perhaps altogether palatable, pro
vided only that the person who tells the truth
is our genuine friend, knows what he is talk
ing about (even though he may not see all
sides of the case), and tells us what he has
to say, not with a desire to hurt our feelings,
but with the transparent purpose to do us
good. With this foreword, here is a part of
the letter:
"I would humbly recommend that you lend
your entire weight to the cause which the
Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America
represents, and especially so In its relation to
the working classes of this country, for whom
It is doing so much good. You know that the
temperance movement is a potent auxiliary to
the institutions of our country in building up
a better manhood and a truer Christianity
among our citizens. It played a very Im
portant part in the two coal strikes of 1900
and IJJOa, respectively, by keeping the men

AIIDRESS OF MITCHELL,.
j President Mitchell of the mine workers
I introduced the President in the following
speech:
: Speaking lor the anthracite coal miners, I
! take great pleasure in supplementing and em
phasizing the greeting and welcome extended
to the i-reeid^nt of the United States on be
hal* of the temperance societies and the muni
i clpal government of Wilkeabarre. It is not
often that the Chief Executive of a. great na
tlcn has found the time or yielded to the in
clination to honor by his presence and to par
ticipate in a meeting uiider the auspices of tha
men who are living by the performance ot
manual labur.
The visit of President Roosevelt to the coal
fields of Pennsylvania as the guest of the ter
n peranee societies and the United Mine Workers
I of America marks an epoch In the civic, social
( arid industrial history of this commonwealth.
I Tfcie occasion is one of peculiar significance
to the men for whom I have the honor to
speak; it is one that will be long remembered
by them. Imprinted indelibly upon the hearts
of the miners is the recollection of the long
contest they had and the great hardships they
endured in the year 1902; a contest brought
to a happy termination through the interven
tion aad mediation of our distinguished guest.
It is a pleasure to ray that largely as a result
of his efforts ar.d mainly as a consequence of
his actlcn the conditions of life and labor
among the anthracite coal mine workers hava
been materially improved and the entire peo
ple of this community have enjoyed an era of
prosperity unprecedented in the history of the
hard coal regions.
It is equally Important to say that many of
the bitter antagonisms and prejudices of for
mer year* both between the miners and theli
employers and even among the mine workers
themselves, have been slowly but surely dissi
pated, and the prospect of permanent and hon
orable Industrial peace grows brighter day by
day.
In the pursuit of its ideals, trades unionism,
has Justified its existence by good works and
high purposes. Slowly and gradually it has
progressed toward the fulfillment of its mia
eloa. It has elevated the standard of living
of the American workman and conferred upon
him higher wajes and more leisure. It has in
creased efficiency, diminished accidents, avert
ed disease, kept the children tn school and
Improved the relations between employer and
employed. It has conferred benefits, made sac
rifices and, unfortunately, committed many
errorr. We believe it not unreasonable to ask
that we be judged not by our faults, but rathei
by our virtues.
To find justification for our existence, or for
the policies we pursue, we do not rely upon
the claims we ourselves make. Abraham Lin
coln, in a speech delivered at Hartford. Conn.,
in IS6O. while addressing the striking shoe
workers, said: "Thank God, we have a sys
tem of labor where there can be a strike
Whatever the pressure, there is a point where
the workman may stop."
TV>ndell Phillips is quoted as having said:
"I rejoice at every effort workmen make tc
organize. I hall the labor movement, it Is my
only hope for democracy. Organize and stand
together. Let the nation hear a united de
mand from the laboring voice,"
William E. Gladstone said: "Trade unions
are the bulwarks of modern democracy." and
so we might go on with endless indorsements
from the great men of the world, whose hearts
beat in sympathy with their struggling fellow
men.
But we need not depend alone upon the ut
terances of the immortal dead. We have with
us as our honored ruest this day a man whose
name and deeds will live a? long as the repub
lic shall endure, one who has on innumerable
occasions spoken in no uncertain terms in de
fense of the right of the workmen to organize.
and has so far subscribed to the constitution
and principles of modern trade unions as him
self to accept honorary membership In one of
them.
And *">w. Mr. President, may I again bid
you welcome? May I express the hope that your
visit among us may prove as pleasant to you
as it is appreciated by us?
REMARKS OP PRESIDENT.
President Roosevelt spoke as follows:
I am particularly glad to speak to this
audience of miners and tneir wives and chil
dren, end especially to speak under the aus
pices of this great temperance society. In
our country the happiness of all the rest of
our people depends most of all upon the wel
fare of the- wage-worker and the welfare of
the- farmer. If we can secure thÂ« welfare of
these two classes, we can be reasonably cer
tain that tha community as a whole will
prosper. And we must never forget that the
chief factor In securing the welfare alike of
wage-worker and of farmer, as of everybody
else, must be the man hlmeelf.
The only effective way to help anybody Is
to help him help himself. There are excep
tional times when any one of us needs out
side help, and then it should be given freely:
but normally each one of us must depend
upon his own exertions for bis own success.
Something can be done by wise legislation
and by wise and honest administration of the
laws; that Is. something can be done by our
action taken in our collective capacity through
the State and nation.
Something .more can bo aono by combina
tion and organization among ourselves In our
private capacities ac citizens, co long as this
combination or organization Is managed with
wisdom and integrity, with Insistence upon
the rights of those benefited and yet with
Just regard for the rights of others.
But in the last analysts the factor most
influential in determining any man's euccess
must ever be the sum of that' man's own
Qualities, of his knowledge, foresight, thrift
ar.d courage. Whatever tends to increase his
self-refpect. whatever tends to help him over
come the temptations witn which all of us
are eurrounded. is of benefit not only to him
but to the whole community.
SELF RESTRAINT JVECESSARY.
No one ' society can do more to help the
wage-worker than such a temperance society
as that which I am now addressing. It la
of incalculable consequence to the man him
self that he should be sober and temperate,
and It Is of even -more consequence to. his
-wife and his children; for it is a hard and
cruel fact that In this life of ours the sins
of the man are often visited most heavily
upon those whose welfare should be his one
special care.
For the drunkard, for the man "who loses
his Job because he cannot control, or will
not control, his desire for liquor . and for
vicious pleasure, we have a feeling of anger
and contempt mixed with our pity; but â¢ for
his unfortunate wife and little ones we feel
only pity, and that of the deepest and tender
eet kind.
Everything possible should be done to en
courage the growth of that spirit of self-re
spect, eelf-restralnt, self-reliance, which. If
It only grows enough, is certain to make all
those in whom it shows Itself move eteadlly
upward toward the highest standard of Am
erican citizenship. It is a proud and respon
sible privilege to be citizens of this greet
self-governing nation: and each of us needs
to keep eteadily before his eyes the fact that
he Is wholly unfit to take part in the work
of governing others unless ne can first govern
himself. He must stand up manfully for his
own rights; lie must respect the rights cf
others; he must obey the law, and he must
try to live up ' to. those rules of righteousness
which arc above and behind all laws.
This applies Just .as much to the man .of
\u25a0roat wealth aa tn tha man of amall means;
He Points Out the Duties of Wage Earners Both
to Themselves and to Others.
Mr. Rogers, United States Consul Gen
eral at Shanghai, to-day cabled to the
State Department that the Chamber of
Commerce there found Itself completely
powerless and that the students were In
control of the boycott situation.
In connection with the boycott, the ru
mor to the effect that John Goodnow,
formerly Consul General at Shanghai, but
who was forced from the service, it now
enlisted in the cause of the Chinese aa
adviser to ex-Minister Wu Ting Fang, is
gaining credence daily.
As a matter of fact, it would not be
surprising if Goodnow had done this very
thing. He went to his "post eight years
ago under fire from political enemies in
Minnesota, where he had lived, and the
American colony in Shanghai continued
that fire, refusing to recognize socially
Mrs. Goodnow, whom he brought with
him from Minneapolis. This protestation
against him came to a focus when he
barred from practice in hiÃ court an
American lawyer named. George Curtis.
The latter was involved. in cases wherein
Americansâ especially one employed in a
subordinate position in the consular ser
viceâwere charged with illegal procure
ment of certificates, enabling them to en
ter Chinese immigrants at the port of
Manila, and with overcharges in fees.
There was a bad mixup in the case. Cur
tic at one time being repudiated as at
torney by the wife of one of the de
fendants in the case. Later he came to
Washington and, although officials for. a
time were inclined to disbelieve his stories
he received an extended hearing from the
Third Assistant Secretary, Mr. Peirce,
and the result was permission to Good
now to resign.

Brain workers suffer from
headache because they over-tax
and exhaust the brain nerves.
Tired, irritated, turbulent
brain nerves throb and ache;
this weakens the brain power,
and robs the memory.
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
bring tranquility to the ex-

If not relieved, this nerve
disturbance is frequently ex-
tended to the stomach, causing
nausea, vomiting â sick head-

Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain > Pills
are convenient to take â just a
little tabjet, that in a few mo-

SELMA, Aug. 10.â Selma haa been a
dry town for nearly one year and a large
majority of tha business men are now
endeavoring to change ....e policy of the
prohibition Board of Trustees. Every
day this week committees have been en
deavoring to get the board to grant at
least one saloon. The fight for an open
town was brought to a head by the filing
of suits against seven persons, who it
was alleged were selling li ...or illegally.
Evidence against these persons was se
cured by detectives posing as Los An
geles fruit buyers. There is much criti
cism of the Board of Trustees and legal
measures may be adopted in an attempt
to oust them from office If they do not
make concessions to the open town ad
vocates.

Mrs. Biroth died the night of May 13
at Fabio!a Hospital, where she had been
taken by O. \V. Biroth, a stableman, re
siding at 52S Twenty-second street. Her
death was from a criminal operation.
Shortly before- the died, Mis. Biroth
mentioned the name of a Mrs. Harrison.
The police put Mrs. Harrison under ex
amination and after a long inquiry she
was allowed to go. The Coroner's jury
a few days later returned a verdict ac
cusing the woman. She was arrested
and detained in jail several days, but no
one appeared to prosecute her, and no
evidence was obtained upon which to
base a complaint, so far as the Police
Department- was concerned. The hus
band of the dead woman refused to take
any action, the report at the time being
â¢that he had been informed by his wife
that her injuries were self inflicted. Chief
of Police Hodgkins has declared that
these stories cf bribery are groundless
and that he is a victim of malicious at
tacks. In her statement to-night, Mrs.
Harrison said:
"There has been much rumor afloat
concerning these charges, and in the
event they are well grounded, the board,
of course, will make a thorough investi
gation."
The woman insists that the Chief of Po
lice defied her and declared if she said
anything about the transaction he would
ruin her business. Rumors concerning
the Harrison < hargc-s have been in cir
culation, but until to-night Mrs. Harri
son had guarded her story against pub
licity.
That there will be an official investi
gation of the charges is a certainty. In.
this connection Mayor Mott, who is
president of the Board of Police and Fire
Commissioners, sa.id:
MAVOK MAKES STATKMEXT.
At the time, s-he adds, the case was
painted as very black against her by
liorfgJdns, and that he said the only way
t-he could prevent a prosecution and
dar-g^r of prison was by acceding to his
ciemand. Mrs. Harrison asserts she was
led to believe that Chief Hodgkins would
use a portion of the money in channels
where it would do her the most good, and
That he was to keep enough of the fund
for himself as payment for his services.
SubseQuently, she declares, not being sat
isfied that the mox<-y had been used as
(she understood it was to be disbursed,
Mrs. Harrison demanded an accounting
from Hogkins, and was told that there
would be no return made.
The woman declares she has two wit
r(s-es= to the visit of Hodgkins to her
residence, one of whom is her aunt, who.
the says, admitted the chief to the
housf, and the other is her eon, Charles

SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 10. â The troubles
of the Seamans are adding to the court
records of Marin County. George B.
Seaman, through his attorneys, filed an
action to-day against Irene L. Cuzner,
his wife's daughter by a former mar
riage, and Guy Cuzner (her husband),
George Henry Abel, his wife's divorced
husband, George Frederick Abel and
George Ernest Abel, her sons by Abel,
John Doe and Richard Roe, charging
them with the alienation of his wife's
affections, and demanding that they
pay him $50,000 damages.
Seaman alleges tnat the defendants,
with the exception of Guy Cuzner, con
spired together and by many false
hoods, false statements and misrepre
sentations to his wife alienated her af
fections and caused her to shun and
avoid him and withdrew her friendship,
comfort and companionship from him.
Seaman married Edith M. Abel April
16, 1902, and for the last two years his
happiness, he alleges, has been marred
by the defendants' interference. She
secured a divorce from Abel without
opposition on his part in the Alameda
County courts. Both Mr. and Mrs. Sea
man^have passed the prime of life.
The tract lies to the south and west
of the university and extends to the
neighboring foothills. The famous old
manor of Peter Coutts. the original
owner of the entire Stanford estate
here, will be included in the boundaries
of the newly opened area.
Those who will build on the location
are, for the larger part, members of
the university faculty. Professor Wil
liam H. Duran. the new chief of the
electrical engineering college, will be
among the first to build. The Duran,
residence will be one of the finest -an
the campus. Boarding and fraternity
houses will comprise a large part of the
community.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Aug. 10.â
A large tract of the Stanford estate at
Palo Alto, adjoining the present resi
dence section of the university campus,
has been opened for building sitea.
None of the land will be sold, but tha
property will be given out on long
term leases.
OAKLAND, Aug. 10.â Although ~e has
escaped facing trial for complicity in the
murder of Thomas Wj Cook, for which
he was first arrested, James Crowhurst,
the leader of the gang, of East Oakland
thugs who robbed and beat the young
grocer to death, is not to be let off light
ly. This morning Crowhurst was arraign
ed before Judge William R. Geary, on a
charge of having held, up and robbed
Edward Stanley, a barber of East Oak
land, on October 8, 1904.
Percy Pembroke, one of the trio who
have been charged with the murder of
Cook, in his confession to Sheriff Barnet,
told of the robbery of Stanley, and said
that the barber had been held up by
Crowhurst and himself. The young thug
eaid that they had planned to hold up
another man, but that he had escaped
and that when Stanley came along they
held him up at the point of a revolver,
securing $25.
Stanley told Constable Carroll that he
thought Pembroke and Crowhurst were
the men who had held him up, but he was
unwilling to swear to a complaint until
after the former had confessed. The au
thorities are now satisfied that they have
enough evidence against the leader of
the ''Jim Crow gang" to send him to
prison for a long term. *
Crowhurst's preliminary examination
was set for August 23. When he was
arraigned this morning, he was not rep
resented by counsel, but it is understood
that Attorney William Williams of San
Francisco haa been retained to defend
him. .
Professor Wt-inholJ was . one of the last
scholar? of the old school whose Interest anj
j.roductlve activity* embraced the entire field
of Gcrrianlcs, the literary side as well as
(be j.hiio!o?lcal. The vastness of his learn
inÃ :s shown by the fact that he was an
uuihrrity in medieval and modern German
dialects, In Germanic archaeology and In folk
ii-re. Accordingly his library is extraordinar
ily comprehensive, more so, probably, titan
any of the othtr Germanic libraries that have
been acquired by American universities: and
It is perfectly safe to say, in this age of
specialization, that none like -it in that re
spect will ever be obtainable in the fu
ture. The value of the collection llea, more
over, not only In its size and range, but In
its quality. It contains a large number of
rare old prints, first editions and the like,
Jast the kind of books that are lndlspensahlt;
for leeeareh work but are very rarely found
In American libraries. On the literary elilo
there are hundreds 'of original tditions of
German writers, from Lutner and Hans SacliE
down to Pchiller and Goetne. Of some poets,
notably of Opitz and Wleland, there are al
most complete sets of first editions. The
principal "Musenalmenaehe," the literary al
manaefcs in which much of the best poetry
of the eighteenth century made Its first ap
pearance, are represented by full sets, as
are also some of the "Tasehenbucher," which
occupied a similar place Â«n literature. The
collection of writings of the "Storm and
Stress" poets and of the RomantlclstG Is es
pecially ricii. And In other fields as well
there is many a rare old tome in covers of
pressed parchment or of leaves from a still
oldor manuscript with beautifully painted
initials. In folklore there la the rare col
lection of proverbs of the year 1560, besides
those of Zinkgref. 1(593, and Ptstorlus. 172 J:
ther<? is the Daemonolojia Rublnzalil of 1683,
and numerous chapbocks of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. In history there
are the chronicles of Aventinus, 15C6, ar.d
Cureus. 1807, the WeKbuch-Spiegel of Sebas
tian Franck, 1534, and the German edition
of the works of Antonius de Guevara, 1644.
The sixteenth century is further represented
by Beatus Rhenanus' biography of Galler yon
Kalstrpberg, 1510. and various controversial
publications of adherents or opponents of the
reformation, as c. g. Erasmus Alberus' Der
Barfueer Munche Eulensplegel, with a preface
by Luther, 1542. The student of the â¢history
of religious or secular songs will find hymn
books and collections of folk c-ongs with notes
dating back as far as 1605, and the philo
logist will rejoice to see De Smet's De literls
et lingua Getarum, 1507, and an Imposing
array of eighteenth century dictionaries. The
library contains further various - copies ot
medieval manuscripts made by Welnhold cr
by students of his. and an extensive manu
script collection of SHeslan proper namÂ«i, of
which Welnhold Intended to compile a volum
inous dictionary. The total number of vol
umes In the library. is 610<5. and of pamphlets
T2~9. The acquisition of this splendid collec
tion makes the German department of the
library of the State university one of the best
equipped in the country and Is an event of the
greatr-st Importance to American students of
Germanics generally.

task of classifying and setting up the

the fine St. Thomas Episcopal Church which
was burned on Tuesday, will be built Imme
diately on the old site.
Of course if the use of automobiles gradu
ally becomes more common. thÂ»-re may come a
time when an ordinance like the one here in
question would be unreasonable. As country
horses are frequently driven into cities and
towns, many of them will gradually become
accustomed to the sight of automobiles and the
(larger of their use of country roads will
grow less. But the Supervisors who passed
th:s ordinance were dealing with present con
ditions in Marin County and we are not pre
pared to say judicially that under present con
ditions the ordinance is so unreasonable as to
be void.
The Supreme Court has decided that
the famous Marin County automobile
ordinance is valid for the present, al
though changing conditions may alter
the constitutionality of the measure.
The contested law is restrictive and
highly obnoxious to those who like to
travel in the machines that eat up
miles of landscape in a breath of time.
Stopping the space annihilators while
country horses plodded by occasioned
motorists so much discomfort that they
determined to test the validity of the
ordinance and Thomas C. Berry was
selected to serve as a sacrifice. He
openly violated the law and was ar
rested. \u25a0 The Superior Court remanded
him to the custody of the Sheriff and
he brought the matter before the Su
preme Court on a petition for awrit of
habeas corpus. After mature consid
eration the Justices have set forth their
conclusions as follows:

SANTA ROSA, Aug. 10. â Teamsters
and laborers in the lumber yards of this
city this morning refused to handle
loads for Lee Brothers' teams, declar
ing: the firm unfair. The strikers were
discharged and now the yards are tied
up. Recently Lee Brothers tried to get
an injunction against the Santa Rosa
Labor Council, which had declared the
firm unfair, and the suit was decided
against the Lees. The move to-day is
the outcome of the. court decision and a
bitter' fight is likely to follow.

CASE AGAINST WAITRESS DISMISSED.â
On motion of the District Attorney yesterday
Judge Cook dismissed the case of Evelyn Starr,
charged with grand larceny, on the ground
that the evidence was insufficient to convict.
The woman is a waitress In a dance hall at
Jackson and Kearny streets, and It was al
leged that on the night of June IS she stole
$XCOO from M. Traynor, a visitor from Sydney,
Australia. .
It is no longer necessary for persons
to suffer from skin diseases since Dr.
Finsen's Invaluable gift to humanity
cures them, and even removes birth
marks.
While in Europe recently Dr. Keck
made a study of . Finsen's discoveries,
and brought back with him a Finsen
ray machine. Although little attention
has been paid, to it in America, in Eu
rope the Finsen light has cured thou
sands of persons of skin diseases. Dr.
Finsen believed that the concentrated
rays of sunlight, robbed of the heat
rays and leaving only the violet, and
ultra violet rays, would kill disease
germs. He proved that his theory was
correct. In 1903 he already had a rec
ord of having cured 800 cases of lupus,
besides many less virulent skin dis
eases.
It may be laid down as a rufe, with
few exceptions, that medical discussions
have little interest for the lay reader;
but a paper on the "Finsen Light," In
the Pacific Medical Journal for August,
by Dr. F. C. Keck, professor of electro
therapeutics in the College of Physi
cians and Surgeons, is worthy of com
ment.

Several napkin-wafters testified that
Mr. Woods' character for honesty was

on more than one occasion he had de
clined to accept a larger "tip" than the

P. Previati informed the court that he
prized the pilfered cornet hardly less

silvery tone, but also on account of his
long possession of it. He might have
forgiven Signor Mifret's purloining of it
if the motive had been other than mer

hardly resist stealing the superb instru

BURKS VAUNTS SAN* FRANClSCO.âSec
retary Burks of the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce has devised a practical way in
which to bring before thousands of visitors at
the Lewis and Clarjt Exposition the facts re
lating to the commerce and general prosperity
of San Francisco. Being Invited to write an
article for the Portland Board of Trade Jour
nal, he has prepared a comprehensive review.
Therein he declares Incidentally that the bay
of San Francisco is one of the four great
harbors of the world.
Mr Rice is of the opinion that as
many miners are at work in Bullfrog as
In Goldfield. and that while the sr-nsa
tional values found In the Goldfield
mines will not be found bo prevalent In
Bullfrog, the latter camp will prove as
lasting as Cripple Creek and Leadville.
Immense bodies of low grade ore are

history win repeat itsoif in Bullfrog.
He predicts s> real estate as well as a
mining boom for the new country.
"Within a fcv.- months all of this will
be rhangred. The transformation will
be complete and sudden. Then, unless
the law of cause and effect Is found to
work inversely, Nevada will witness a
mining- boom In Bullfrog- that will put
In the shade those that Tonopah and
Goldf.eld enjoyed in their first heyday"
"There are no less than three elec
tric power companies now building into
Bullfrog. Across the California line. 90
or 100 miles away, there are rushing,
turbulent streams and rivers, running
waste. Water and power there; pold
and no power in Bullfrog.- The natural
result is coming in the compensating
exchange, with electricity as a medium.
"What this means to Bullfrog is be
yond estimation, for It Insures the pro
fitable handling of ores carrying values
of $10 per ton upward. Until the pres
ent the mines have been unable to han
dle any but the high grade shipping
ores, the rich mineral products that pay
far and beyond the high cost of trans
portation, by mule team and railroad,
to distant mills and smelters.
'"In addition, a railroad is being
graded at this moment from Las Vegas,
on the south, to Bullfrog, a distance of
12". miles. It will be an extension of
the San Pedro road and will connect
Kalt Lake City and Los Angeles with
the great Nevada mineral belt. There

the town of Bullfrog and the mines that
surround it for its railway facilities
when these roads are constructed.

The Chinese bureau, learning of the

the hope of capturing the two remain

their whereabouts had not been found
out yesterday.
At the mission It was stated that
Mrs. Davis, the superintendent, was out
of town and would not return until to
morrow, and that in the meantime no
information was to be given out.
Three Chinese women who arrived on
the Siberia were allowed a landing last
Monday on the representation of three
Chinese, claiming nativity here,, that
they were the husbands of the women.
It transpired, however, that the
women were brought to the United
States for immoral purposes. One of
them got into communication with the
Methodist Chinese Mission on "Wash
ington street and was rescued. This
woman made a confession to the effect
that she was not married to the Celes

William Brown, a business man, and

James A. McGinley's statement that
William F. Hopkins' deliberately lay in
wait for him and stabbed him with
murderous intent while he was leaving
a house on Ellis street one night sev
eral weeks ago. The attack was In re
taliation for Hopkins' ejectment from
the house after he had struck a woman
inmate. McGinley's wounds were so
serious as to confine him to his home
for several weeks, and he is still under
a surgeon's care. The coat and shirt
worn by him when stabbed were pro
duced in evidence, and the knife cuts
shown to the Judge.
Hopkins was concealed in a hall
way, between two doors, when he al
lowed Brown and Egan to pass him
unmolested, after which he plunged his
knife Into McGinley. The prosecution
claims that this showed premeditation,
as McGinley had been most conspicu
ous in protecting the woman from Hop
kins' onslaught.
The defense will be given an inning

Miss Miller told the detectives that
she originally owned forty-seven arti
cles of jewelry of this character. She
has disposed of thirty-eight of them
throughout the city, and, until she ran
amuck of Rosenburg and his file, she
met with success. She says the chains
cost her about $11 apiece and that she
only doubled their cost price when she
disposed of them. The jewelry is a very
good imitation.
It is the opinion of the police that
Miss Miller committed no crime. She
merely worked a game which some
pawnbrokers often work on the unsus
pecting public, and offered the same ex
cuse for her conduct as they do when
their victims assert they did not receive
their moneys worth. She requested the
loan of money on her wares, and the
brokers, believing them to be gold in
stead of lead and heavy plating, paid
the amount asked. According to their
statements, the woman did not repre
sent the articles to be gold, but allowed
them to judge for themselves according
to weight, tests and appearance. The
pawnbrokers, scenting a bargain, de
livered up the loan.
Josie Miller, who, with an accom
plice, rloocicd the town with spurious
jewelry, was released from custody last
night, but it is likely that she will be
arrested again mis morning: pn com
piaint of several of the pawnbrokers
wno fell the victims of her wares. De
tective Tom Kyan, who has nad charge
of the caso, notified the dealers tha^.
they must make complaint against the
woman, otherwise she would be granted
her liberty. None of tnem appeared at
the appointed hour and the prison doors
were thrown open to the prisoner, who
hastily left the Hall of Justice.
Soon after the woman's release from
police custody two of tho disgruntled
victims rushed to the hall, but Detec
tive Ryan had left for his home and
they were told to get a warrant for the
woman's arrest to-day. This they prom
ised to do, and despite the fact that
they were told a charge would hardly
be sustained before any court they were
willing to take a chance on the prose
cution.

No les| is marriage protected in England by the prevailing prejudice
against divorce. Although divorces are no longer barred from the court of St.
James, and although the divorce laws of England have become less stringent
than of yore, yet the English people are thoroughly opposed to what they re
gard as disrespect toward a time-honored and sacred obligation, which they con
sider religious as well as social. .
Sense of nationality is another powerful influence upon the happiness of Eng
lish marriages. Love of home is deeply rooted in the English breast, and this
love of home springs from a' 1 feeling of nationality. Love of family is part of
it equally with love of country. That "national soul" for which President Roose
velt has pleaded with the American people, in speaking of race suicide, needs no
advocate in ; England, for here tradition and custom have put family relations
upon a proper basis. i
LONDON, July 20.
THOUGH one were an ardent advocate of the cause of woman's equal rights
with man, one could not justly criticize Englishmen adversely for exacting
wifely submission, and insisting upon a husband's right to authority in the
household, for even the English woman suffragists have put themselves on record
as conservative and opposed to change in the established ideas of marital rela
tionship. And as the old proverb puts it: "No injustice is done to a consenting
person."
As you possibly remember, when an attempt was made at the international
congress of women, which was held .in Berlin a few years ago, to adopt radi
cal resolutions defying, men,, it was at the wish of the English delegates that the
declaration which had been drawn up asserting that woman does not owe obe
dience to her husband was stricken out, and the word "tyranny," which appeared
in the resolution, was changed to "misuse of power."
The English woman is very sane in her ideas of her marriage obligations.
Though she may desire her legal rights in regard to property, she is content with
her role of woman, and appreciates the influence which she gains through wife
hood and through becoming the mother of sons.
In general, English marriages are happy. For this the feeling of class which
rules all social life is in part responsible. Usually husband and wife have the
same social standing, and this means, naturally, a common point of view, the.
same ambitions and a mutual understanding. \- V /"â¢
That agreement about life, which Stevenson defines as a sort of talent for
matrimony, and considers as an *ndlspensable factor in congeniality, results and
makes for domestic happiness. And certainly great credit Is due to the wife, for
as the writer of "Virginibus Puerisque" has pointed out, while both husband and
wife must be versed In the niceties of the heart and born with a faculty of willing
compromise if they are to dwell together happily for long years of wedlock, still
much devolves upon the woman. She must be talented as a woman, and it does
not much matter if she is not talented in anything else. "She must know her
'metier de femme' and have a fine touch for the affections."

GLOVES FOR WORKMEN.
That the all-important question of \u25a0 the full
moon, and incidentally the influence of the
goddess Eastra, should be the fountajnhead of
the hare's connection with our Easter customs
may seem strange to \u25a0 tha superficial objwrver
and yet, does not the efflcacy of the left hind-f
foot of a graveyard hara (or rabbit) He In the
fact that this animal is. in the negro mind,
the symbol of the new moon, the conqueror of
darkness. and all evil things? And how many
years is it since, over in the old Vaterland, in
SwaMa, a child would have exposed himself
to a good spanking if he had indulged in th"
pastime of making shadow pictures of hares
on the wall, as It was a sin against the moon?
And if we were to go farther aflÂ«ld we would
find the Chinese representing the moon as a
hara pounding rice in a mortar: and the Jap
anese painting it right across the disc of the
moon; and the Hindus locating its abode in
the moon Itself, and weaving singularly pretty
stories in explanation of the same, one of which
being to the effect that the great god Indra,
the god of the elements, disguised as a starv
ing pilgrim, was once begging men for a little
food, and all in vain, when a hare, seeing his
pitiable condition, and having nothing else to
gi\-e him, threw itself into a neighboring flre
that it might get roasted and thus save his
life,, whereupon the grateful god transferred
the hare to the moon, in witness whereof, no
tice that the Sanskrit "cacas," the leaping one.
Is applied not to the hare alone, but to the
cpots in the moon which show his profile.
The Egyptian word "Un," a hare meant also
"to open," also when used adjectively "periodi
cal." and when employed as a noun "a pe
riod"; it very naturally happened, therefore,
that the hare became the type of periodicity;
and as the moon was from time Immemorial
the great ''measure of time" (its Sanskrit
name, "lias." is derived from ths verb "ma,"
to measure), both were identified in many
ways, and chiefly as marking the opening of
now seasons, the beginning of a new life, etc.;
and it was not, long before the popular mind
connected tha hare with the opening of a new
year at the Easter full moon, and subsequently:
with the Paschal eggs which used to be broken
for the purpose of symbolizing that very open
ing. ]
Her* stepped in an old tradition that the hare !
was originally a bird, that on its own request
It was transformed into & quadruped by the
goddess Eastra (mentioned above), and that in
gratitude it kept on exercising its original j
functions once a year and Uid eggs for its ben- j
efactress on her festal day. Accordingly, chil
dren were sent out on Easter day to look for
hares' eggs and how many of our readers may
remember going on such an errand, who came
to these shores from any of the countries where
Teutonic mythology Etlll holds sway?
In England the only trace of the hare we can
call to mind in connection with Easter Is a
custom which still survives (or at least sur
vived a few years ago) at Coleshill. in War
wickshire, where, if the young men of the par-
Jsh can succeed In catching a hare and bring
it to the parson before 10 a. m. on Easter Mon
day (moon-day) he is by tradition bound to
present them with a hundred eggs.
The suggestion of such a gift may have
sprung from the scarcity of the animal at the
time, for It must be remembered that there
were parts of Great Britain (Scotland, for In
stance), where the rabbit was introduced for
the first time as late as the beginning of thÂ«
nineteenth century. Its original home Is eup
posed to have been Spain, or at least that sec
tion of the Mediterranean . shores. \ '

So far iliat eloquent coupon is stumping the district and get
ting the applause, with a promise of the votes, and if Tammany
would beat Mr. Hearst in this game of free rides, drinks, victuals and
side shows it must rise early or stay up all night.
HOX. WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST, member of Con
gress from the New York tenderloin, proposes to defy Tam
many. Mr. Murpln- decided that Mr. Hearst shall not be
â¢nominated in the district next year. Mr. Hearst decides that he
will be nominated. He has begun his campaign by giving a coupon
ticket to every man, woman and child in the district. This ticket
is good for a trip to Manhattan Beach, with coupons to all the res
taurants, the zoo and to the sideshows where they may see the
hoochy coochy and the girls all dressed in tights.
There is in this, no doubt, the most advanced statesmanship.
Twcel was re-elected to the State Senate after his crimes were
exposed, by sending a turkey and a barrel of flour to every family
in his district. Mr. Hearst follows his example. But Tammany is
to be heard from. What bid will it make against the Hearst cou
pons? Why not a voyage to Europe, whence most of the people
in the district came? Perhaps a year's rent and a free bill for the
growler would fairly compete with the Coney Island trip.

always are fairly decent and honest.
Philadelphiaâ to select Just one Instance
of manyâ has been rankly foul these
many years; but her citizens have just
proved that it was not with their con

then, with decency in the majority, that
the story of municipal .rottenness Is so

There are big spoils in the political game;
the ever-present scoundrel has his eye

and he plays his rascally cards for all
there is in them. In the meantime the
honest citizen, being intent upon his own
business and the money there is in it,
lets tbe knave play his game as he will.
To be sure, the decent citizen eventually
must pay a part of the price of the
other's knavery, but the sum thus paid
does not show on his ledger, and so he
lets the matter go. The scoundrel wins
out, and he remains winner until the hon

political knave retiresâ until he deems it
safe again to skulk from his hole, which
is afjter the decent citizen has gone to

The department is now under fire. By no fault of the Secretary
its scientific operations have been handicapped by the insufficient
compensation given to experts. Xo branch of science is of greater
benefit to the farmer than vegetable physiology and pathology.
Men skilled in these, as soon as their work becomes known, are
eagerly sought at large salaries by other Governments. The de
partment has taught the farmer what plant food means, that he must
first feed the plant before the plant will feed him. The department
expert in that branch found that his services in private employment
would command a vastly greater compensation than the depart
ment paid him.
There was some interlocking between his work in the depart
ment and his preparation for leaving it, but this affords no ade
quate ground for a scandal. The only scandal is in connection
with the leak in the cotton crop reports. This is established by
proofs. The statistical bureau is being reorganized, and its head
has resigned. Upon his resignation the fact was divulged that his
salary was $1400 per year! Here was a man in charge of a confi
dential matter.of the first class, with the cotton crop reports able
to affect the market one way or the other $30,000,000 in one day,
getting a salary of about $3 a day.
Hod carriers are better paid and bricklayers get twice that sum
per day. Yet Congress insists upon rating positions like that in
the Agricultural Department the same as mere clerical, positions in
the other departments, and the Secretary is powerless. Congress
applies the same principle of compensation to the scientific work of
the department in soils, plants and seed distribution, vegetable path
ology and physiology and entomology.'
The country is ready to support the application of a, different
principle of compensation to the scientific and statistical work
which is peculiar to the Agricultural Department, and has no ana
logue in any other department of the Government. Secretary Wil
son has the undiminished confidence of the country, and more. He
has the gratitude of the farmers of the United States, who will
support him in everything necessary to increase the efficiency of
his department.
More ihan all ibis, he has invested what was considered clod
hopping drudgery with an intellectual interest that has put farming
in the list of learned crafts. That vocation is now illuminated by
Science. Its drudgery is lightened by variety, and the result is
seen in the tendency of population to countermarch back to the
farm. Dull routine has been replaced by a zest that runs from the
breeding and care of farm animals clear through all the operations
of feed time and harvest, and by investing results with greater cer
tainty rural life has received an impulse of the greatest importance
to the social and civic institutions of the country.
The Agricultural Department germinated in the Patent Office.
The Commissioner of Patents distributed seeds, through members
of Congress. But there was ho systematic search for new plants
or for study of their adaptation to our physical conditions or their
value as an addition to our crops. It was hit or miss. After many
years all of this was transferred to an Agricultural Bureau of the
Interior Department, presided over by a commissioner. 'Here the
work was extended and intelligent farmers all over the country
began to get glimpses of the possibilities of what might be done
by higher organization and fitting facilities.
This conception of future benefits caused the promotion of the
bureau to be an executive department, with a Cabinet officer at
its head. This occurred a short time before the close of Mr. Cleve
land's first administration, and Mr. Coleman, the Commissioner, be
came Secretary of Agriculture. The development which began
then has reached its highest point under Secretary Wilson, and
every farm and every farmer, from semi-arctic Maine |to semi-tropi
cal California, has felt the impulse which the Secretary has im
parted to the rural industries of the country.
The soil has 3)ccn made more fruitful, the seed more certain
2nd the crop larger by the work of Secretary Wilson. He has
gi\~v L California the Smyrna fig, to the Dakotas high-bred wheat,
to low a a larger yield of corn' He is turning our Southwestern
deserts into dale orchards, and with demonstration farms is pre
paring to make government irrigation a success, by eliminating the
long empirical period in which settlers lose money and courage.
During his service, since 1897, Secretary Wilson has trans
formed American agriculture. It is no longer carried on by rule
of thumb, as a haphazard industry. The farmer's part in it, which
covers all that is* not controlled by wind and weather, has been
made as exact an art as manufactures. The extension of the weather
service and its practical application to the needs of agriculture

'TP'HE Department of Agriculture at Washington has risen to
I first rank among the activities of the Government. It has
.*\u25a0 added to the production of the country a sum of values so far
in excess of its cost that it may be said to not only pay its own way.
but that it is one of the largest contributors to the support of .the
other executive departments.
THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT.
There's a sweet little nest In the top
of a tree â
Great Caesar! There be, sir!â
Where Willie is happy as happy can be,
To squeeze 'er and please 'er;
And here is the moral, my. boy, if you
please:
If a< maid is coquettish, won't take the
\u25a0 \u25a0 degrees.
Don't wail out your heart in the top of
- the trees,
But seize 'er, you geezer! .
Then she lifted her head, and she trilled
with a sob:
"Oh, Willie! Come, Willie;
For my poor little heart for your com
ing doth throb â
I'm silly, so silly!"
Then he sorter flew in and he kinder
flew out.
Each moment some nearer hia daisy no
doubt,
As she sung, while her bill wore an
. amorous pout,
"Please, Willie! Come, Willie."
Then the little bird sung from the limb
of the tree,
"Who asked yer, dodgast yer!"
An,d he ilew straight away, though it
hurt him maybe,
For pasture, fresh pasture;
And the one whom he left â for love is
the same
In the breast of a bird or the. breast of
a. dame â '.. \u0084 .:\u25a0 'Â£ \u25a0 \u25a0'.--.
Went turbulent tears as she heard him
proclaim,
"Who asked yer, dodgast yer!" ; %
Then she flirted her head, and she said
with a wink,
"You're sappy, dear chappie,".
And of course her words made him, as
lovers must think,
Unhappy, unhappy! !;.\u25a0;>.>' c.j ;â¢ ".';
For love is a blessing, or love is a
sting;
In a man or a bird 'tis a wonderful
thing,
But still she remarked with a flirt of
her wing,
"You're sappy, dear chappie."
A LITTLE bird sat on the limb of a
tree.
Singing, "Daisy! my daisy!" .
And his daisy replied supercil
iously,
"You're crazy, plum crazy."
For the whisper of love in the bosom la
heard \u25a0
Of the mightiest man and the tiniest
bird, . .-
And so he rerieated in a manner absurd,
"Oh, daisy! My daisy!"

WE SHOULD LIVE RADIANT LIVES
ANGELA MORGAN
TO live so radiantly, so happily and so ,>opefully that those who come In
touch with us shall be made gladder and better for the contactâ this should
be the supreme aim of every one's ambition.
Unless we influence for good the people we meet; unless by our presence
'we stimulate, inspire and encourage every one with whom we associate, we have
failed in one of the greatest obligations of life.
To keep cheerful and sunny and full of faith is a duty that devolves upon every
thinking being. Whoever fails to discharge it cheats society and robs one's self
as well. *.r ',
It is of minor importance that we should please, or charm, or impress by
virtue of wit, or intellect, or talents. It is of small moment whether we amuse
and entertain. The question is, do we bless and inspire? Is our influence genu
inely uplifting and thoroughly helpful? \u25a0 .
The other achievements have their place. They possess a certain significance.
But there is no achievement to compare with that of making one's self a source
of positive joy and hope and inspiration to others.
If we spent one-tenth the energy trying to do this that we employ in striving
to impress with our personal gifts and abilities, how much more beautiful and
useful our lives would become! For there is nothing that so completely changes
one's outlook, nothing that so brcadena and deepens the currents of existence;
as sincere outreach of soul in the wish to help and encourage others.
It is well .to be cheerful for our own sakes. for our. own health and success,
but it |s better to be cheerful from the desire to make others happy. Â» *
So much has been said about the necessity for a uniformly cheer^
ful state of mind. Physicians recognize as never before how powerfully mental
" conditions affect the body. It has been demonstrated that thoughts of fear, de- .
spondency, hatred, malice and the like have the effect of poisoning the physical
system, and that thoughts of an opposite nature serve to promote health.*
So it is becoming quite the fashion to be cheerful from selfish motives mere
ly. But to keep-happy and serene because thereby one preserves his health,
his looks, or his power to please is not the highest motive*
In the end one is much more likely to find his health improved if he practices
cheer for the sake of others than if he does so for the specific purpose of ben
efiting himself. After all, the greatest benefits to self are attained through al
truism. "'""-
We owe it to every one with whom we associate to live and think radiantly;
to create about ourselves a luminous atmosphere of happiness so positive that all
who come into our world are aware of a renewing influence.
It is a peculiarity of radium that it transmits its own properties to other
substances. If a solid body is placed near a salt of radium it becomes radio
active. '->'â¢*.\u25a0 ',
The emanations given off by a minu luminous with joy are quite as definite
and tangible in a spiritual sense as are these radium emanations.
It is possible for every one to live the radiant life. You who read this may
begin now to make yourself a center of happiness and illumination.
Don't say that In a universe as big as this your thinking does not count.
Every one's thinking counts. Every one's life counts. It does not matter very
greatly whether you live indifferently or whether you live gloriously. You have
your particular place in the vast system of things that makes the universe.
When you fail to live Â«.o your highest the lack is felt throughout the entire ma
chinery. Â»*;;'
Be glad. Be sunny. Be a glowing center of happiness. Every one you meet
needs the stimulus you can give. v;i/

Milliken Brothers maintain that the
cracks in the thirteen pieces of steel
were caused by the way they were
packed on the steamer in which they
were conveyed to this coast. They as
sert that the Carnegie test would be
sufficient to prove the strength of the
remaining beams. George W. Dickie,
however, maintains that the Carnegie
test is inadequate in this instance, as
that test will not prove the resistance
of the beams against jars. He believes
that it will not be safe to use the beams
unless they have been proved by the
drop test, which consists of raising the
beams on end to an angle of twenty
five degrees and letting them drop.
Commissioner Henry J. Croker sug
gested that the best way out of the di
lemma would be to condemn the entire
lot and that such action would be with
in tho limits of the specifications. Chief
Engineer Norton agreed with Crocker
and after some discussion the board ac
quiesced. ' The engineer was told to
make a full report at the next meeting.
George W. Dickie, who was called in
by Norton as an expert, recommended
that the entire lot be subjected to the
drop test. This is strenuously objected
to by Milliken Brothers, local agents
of the firm that supplied the steel. They
maintain that the syeclftcations call for
the . Carnegie test and that if the drop
test is used it must be done at the risk
of the Harbor Commissioners.
Chief Engineer Lott D. Norton report
ed to the Harbor Commissioners yester
day that thirteen of . the steel beams
sent hero from the East for the new
Mail Dock were cracked and that the
indications are that the remainder of the
175 are brittle.
This is one of many handbooks pub
lished by the California Promotion Com
mittee, but is looked upon by it as one
of importance. Those interested In tree
planting should not neglect to send for
a copy.
"From the standpoint of both the Indi
vidual ond the community," says Prof.
Jepson, who has given special study to
this subject, "there is no other asset
that can be put upon the land of muni
cipal and agricultural California so val
uable as trees. And there is particular
need for planting trees in what is prac
tically waste land, the curb-lines of
streets and the sides of county roads.
Such trees, properly planted and per
sistently cared for, are valuable to all
as well to one for several good reasons.
As a purely commercial matter it is now
well known that street or road trees
increase property values. Authenticated
cases are at hand where naked farm
land of superior value has sold at less
price than inferior land fronted by lines
of roadside trees. And this difference is,
to a certain extent, justified because In
these days of increasing wood scarcity,
trees have in themselves a great value.
As a matter of comfort, too, street trees
are a boon in a land where for five or
six months cloudless skies prevail."
The pamphlet calls attention to certain
rules or canons which are everywhere
applicable to the selection, arrangement
and planting of trees on street and coun
ty roads and Js of great value to the
numerous tree-planting clubs which have
recently come into existence.
Deciduous trees, evergreen trees 'and
palms are the three classes recommended
for general use. A list of deciduous
trees, with the advantages and disad
vantages of each as a street tree, takes
up many pages of the pamphlet.
Good advice in the way of "Special
Reminders" is given in conclusion, tell
ing how planting Bhould be done and
giving advice for the care and protection
of the tree thereafter.
The California Promotion Comittee has
issued a pamphlet entitled "Street Trees
in California," written by Willis L. Jep
son. Ph. D., Professor of Botany, Uni
versity of California, which promises to
be of great value to cities and towns
of the State.

will be of a snappy order.
The following' officers will act as

The coming 1 department athletic con
tests to take place at the Presidio on

interest, not only in the troops who are
to participate In the events, but also in
all artsy circles here. Every post in
this department, except the, posts at
Hawaii, will be represented in the dif
ferent contests.
Vast lofscs to the holders of shares in
Chinese canneries in California are im
pending. As a consequence groat excite
nunt pervades Chinese rank?. Two ean
lu-ries owned by Chinese in this city are
liable to lose ai least $75,<Kw each, accord
ing to current reports. Farmers of Cali
lori'.ia art also out considerable sums if
they lacked the foresight 10 take advan
tage of conditions that have been pre
sented to ihÂ»-m to make money on what
vas, not long ago. a rising fruit market.
These effects result from the same cause,
a mlsapp: ehension. early in the present
eeason, about the size of the prospective
fruit crop of California.
From pome source rumors were circu
lated some months ago that there would
b<? a great scarcity of jfruit. Those to
whom this rumor has been attributed
deny that they have made public any
finding thai was reported to them when
they had agents sent to visit the several
fruit-grownig sections. But the idea be
came prevalent, in some way. that fruit
would be scarce. Then in rushed the
Chinese canneries and made contracts at
high prices. Possibly some wiiite men
owning canneries did the same. The
management of the California Canneries
Company is credited on the street with
having stood aloof when prices were high
and with forecasting the situation with
more accuracy than was contained in
the early seasonal rumors. Pears brought
very high prices under contract. Peaches
v.ere similarly elevated when the can
neries came to buy.
No one, except the parties in interest,
know exactly what prices were made in
contracts, but the significant statement
â¢was made in this city a few days ago by
a farmer that he had refuse^ $50 a ton
toy pears, but that he was now com
pelled to offer them for J2O a ton, on ac
count of the great amount of fruit sud
denly matured and cent to market.
The Chinese and other early buyers of
fruit are awakened to the fact that later
buyers would be able to beat them in the
market for canned products by a large
majority margin by using the later fruit
just ir., all of which, competitively mar
keted, is subject to very low sale prices.
The present outlook is that the canning
si ason, by reason of these conditions,
will be long remembered as oije of large
t-ins to the canners who failed to be
lieve fruit would be scarce and of losses
to those who bought early under con
tracts, with the belief that only the early
<.mcrs would have a chance to secure
enough fruit for canning. Wise farmers
and wise ranners have been the winners
w hile farmers who held out for too much
&Â»d oanners 1 who contracted unwisely
lose largely.

Thousands Write to Mrs.Pinkham, Lynn,
Mass., and Receive Valuable Advice
Absolutely Confidential and Free
There ran be no more terrible ordeal
to a delicate, sensitive, refined woman
than to be obliged to answer certain
questions in regard to her private ills,
even when those questions are asked
by her family physician, and many
r^kAirs-T.C-WiUadsen R)
continue to suffer rather than submit
to examinations which so many^ physi-
cians propose in order to intelligently
treat the disease ; and this is therea-
son why so many physicians fail to
cure female disease.
This is also the reason why thousands
"jfcs-.pon thousands of women are corre-
sponding with Mrs. Pinkham. at Lynn,
Mass. To her they can confide every
detail of their "illness, and from
her great knowledge, obtained from
years of experience in treating female
ills. Mrs. Pinkham can advise women
more wisely than the local physician.

T.. C. Willadsen, of Manning. la. She

The Doctor Writes of Counterfeiters.
OHAS. m FLETCHER, New York City. HyamuS) MasSl) May 12 ' 1900<
-Dear Mr. Fletcher:â l wish to congratulate you on your numerous vic-
tories over counterfeiters and imitators of Castoria, and trust the time is not far
distant when these inferior and dangerous mixtures will be entirely suppressed.
You are right when you say in your advertisements that it is "Experience
against Experiment"
I feel it to be an outrage, and an imposition upon the parents of little chil-
dren tfiat my name should be associated with imitations of Castoria, dangerous to
the health and life of these little ones who too often fight their battles for life in vain.
Let me again commend you for the high standard you have maintained
in the preparation of my? prescription, and I confidently believe it is due to this
scrupulous integrity you are indebted for the wonderful sale of Castoria to-day,
and the steady growth it has had since I gave you the details of its mauufacture
in^yja^toi^hiig-^ years ago. qJL^x 4&.jL>-*Â».i,.

"I am willing to sign with the club right now," said
Nolan. "Any prnposit^m that is anywhere near fair is agree-
"1 do not want to have any more dealings with irrespon
sible parties." retorted' Britt, "and if I am to do business
here to-night it will be directly with the club. This fellow
Nolan has gone out and made the false statement that Britt
wanted Nelson to lay down to him, and I will have no
business dealings with him."
"If the club finds it impossible to make- this match with
the representative? -,f Britt and Nelson now present," con
tinued Britt. "1 wili delegate my power to some other person
to make this match. All I want is this match."
The fighters are also to get a privilege of a thare of the
moving pictures which are to be taken of the contest. Brilt
agrred to take a oÂ»:e-third of interest of the pictures, while
Nolan accepted $59iM outright as his share.
Coffroth opened the meeting by informing the rival man
agers that be had made an offer of $20,0J0, or 65 per cent of
the gross receipts, for a match to take place at Colma on
September 'J.
â¢'1 have been eritieized for talking several times," inter
rupted Nolan, ""but I !Â»till siy that the Britts are not on the
levfl with us and lam willing to bet $300 they will not
sign."
Aftor diplomatic negotiations extending over many months
Jimmy Britt and Battling Nelson signed articles last night to
iVuht forty-five rounds at Colma on the afternoon of September
S>. The contest is to take place in an arena to be erected at
Union Courting Rark. The lighters are to battle for 05 per
cent or the gross receipts and a tide bvt of $10,000. Britt hns
been guaranteed that his share will be 520J000 if he wins. The
referee will be selected before the 26th inst. William F. Britt
and Billy Nolan signed for the boxers, while Manager Jim
CoSrctb looked after the interest of his club. Money In big
euros was so freely mentioned as to make it appear the Jap
aneee Indemnity was under discussion.
It took three houra before the deiaiis of the match were
ft tiled at. the conference in the Columbian building. For a

was determined the club should truarantee a purse cf $20.Q3 ! )
as well as allowing him the privilege of C 5 per cent of the
pi oss receipts. Britt's anxiety to make the match did not pie
\> nt him making a good financial arrangement, and he stuck
to Ma demand sill through. Coffroth, on th<> other hand,
flatly refused to male liim the offer he wanted. Nelson's
manager came to the rescue at a time when it appeared that
Britt nnd Nolan would not sign and the situauon was cleared
up. Nolan said he would po?t $10,C00 in the hands of the club
manager to-day if Coffroth would make good the other $10.
000 as a guarantee to Britt that the winner's share would be
KO.OOO.
They agreed to have both contestants to weigh 133 pounds
at 10 o'clock the morning of the contest, which will be Admis
sion day. An arena will bo built to seat 15,000 people. The
largest attendance ever at a flffht here was 10,000 when Jef
fries and Corbett fought.
"Well, my offer is final," exclaimed Coffroth. "Well, so is
mine," retorted Britt. The sporting men, managers, and news
paper men assembled in the room were making- their -way to
the door, concluding that the Britt-Xelson match was still
as fur off as ever, when Billy Nolan arose from his seat and
said he would guarantee Britt a $20,000 purse. This came as
a thunderbolt from the skios. No one could speak for a
moment. Finally he was asked what he meant.
"Well," Nolan said, "I will post $5000 to-morrow with Man
ager Coffroth and should the match not draw $20,000 it can go
to Britl to make up the drficier.cy should Britt win." This
was not satisfactory to Britt, who demanded that a check of
J20.000 be posted. It was evident Nolan had overreached him
self when he offered to guarantee Britt 120,000, as he ac
knowledged he could not raise this amount. Another dead
lock resulted in which all kinds of explanations were offered,
but a breach between Coffroth and Britt existed as to who
would get the best o? the matter.
Nolan evidently did not want to lose the match for ho
again came to the rescue with an offer to post $10,000 if Crof
,'roth would post a like amount as Brltt's guarantee. x,Nolan's
offer means that if Brltt should win and his percentage of the
purse is less than $20,000 Nolan will be compelled to make the
deficiency between the $10,000 guaranteed by Croffroth and
J20.000 purse guaranteed.
Other arrangements went along without a hitch and showed
that both managers- were anxious that their charges should
meet. Forfeits of $2600 will be posted by each contestant with
Harry Corbett as weight and appearance money. They will
also put up like amounts as a guarantee that the referee will
be selected by the 26th inst.
l r or the' net half hour Coffroth and Britt harangued, each
accusing the other of wanting the best of it. All kinds of
propositions were oftered but each was determined to gain his
point.

Manager Coffroth asked the managers the percentage pro

"I'll ta-.e 65 perceit of the gross receipts,," answered No
lan, "and &JOOO for m/ iiortion of the moving pictures." "I
want both privileges." shouted Britt. "If the contest should
draw more than $20,0*0 1 want C 5 p?r cent of it." "That is not
my offer," â¢ responded Coffroth. "1 never made that offer. 1

BUFFALO. Aug. 10. â It was the
unanimous opinion of the regular race
goers on the Canadian circuit that the
third event at six tuilonss at Fort Erie
to-day brought together the best field
of sprinUrs that have ever met in Can
ada. The wind was a little unfavorable
and the track somewhat dtad or a new
Canadian record for the distance might
have btcn hung out. As it was. they
stopped tiie distance in 1:13 1-5. Rusk,
splendidly ridden by Alunro, finished
first by a head, with La Londe the same
distance in front of Rebo. The winner
was all cut and the other two would
have passed him in another stride.

HELENA, Mont., Aug. 10.â Argument in
the Cobban land fraud case was be
gun this afternoon In the United' States
Court. United States District Attorney
Carl Basch opened for the government
and occupied about two hours. He told
in detail of the transactions of Cobban
with entry men and women, stating to
the jury that in every instance Cobban
had furnished the money for the locators
to make their entries and later had fur
nished the money to make final pay
ment, without taking any security. He
also dwelt' on the fact that in the cases
of about eighty entrymen and entry
women, deeds had been made to Cobban
either on the day they made final pay
ment to the land office or within a few
days and that in nearly every instance
the amount netted by the entryman
was $100. â¢ '
Judge Hunt ruled against the admis
sion of the record in the Clark civil
suit and denied a motion of the defense
to instruct the jury to acquit. The case
will probably go to the ; jury on Satur
day morning. \u25a0

COBBAN UNDER FIRE
IN LAND FRAUD CASE
Shortly before the departure of the
Kanagawa a lire started in the cotton,
and before it could be extinguished had
destroyed some :*OOO bales. Captain
Wale states that the loss was scaicely
noticeable to the casual observer, and
that the space which the burned cot
ton had taken was filled almost imme
diately by oth*r bales, which were dis
charged from the many ships.
The greater- part of this cotton is
American product, although a small
percentage comes from India. Captain
Wale says that a. large amount of cot
ton-weaving machinery is being in
stalled in Japan, and that the manufac
ture of cotton fabrics is rapidly becom
ing :i great industry in the land of the
Mikado.
SKATTLE, Aug. 1 01â When the
Kanagawa Maru lef tÂ» Kobe on hÂ«r last
voyag-p to PHiittle there wore more than
eighty ships either at the docks of that
port or lying- in the offing- awaiting
their . opportunity to discharge; their
cargoes, which, for the most part, con
sisted of cotton. This commodity, ac
cording* to Captain Wale of the Kanaga
wa, is crowding every warehouse along
the water front of Kobe and is over
flowing: into the fields which extend
back from the town.

Treaty-two of the Russian immigrants
"waiting at the Pacific Mail wharf und*>r
order of <I*;y>rTaTion were taken to Angfl
If-land - on the quarantine
st*-anvÂ»r General Stprnhcrs to attend the
funeral of a Russian woman, one of
\u2666 heir little company, who <iied at the
quarantine- station a victim of Chagrcs
fever. On hÂ«-r death bed the \u25a0woman ex
pressed a wish that her country folk,
w-sth whom she had made the long jour
ney 10 America, could be present when
her body r-if laid to rest in foreign soil
and f urgeo'n dimming sent word to her
That if it lay. in his power ber desire
h*- gratified. And it eras.
Efforts are lieing* made to save the Rus
tiacs> from deportation and' the depart
ment at Washington has been asked for
a speciaj ruling m their case. A few
of proper care, it is said, would
"reftcrTe those now under order of depor
tation .to health. I'nde.f the " circum-
th*> order of deportation means a.
f^nten^e of death for the unfortunate
nr;*;?ia!isÂ«. They came here from Russia
hy way of Panama. Among those de
ported *-^re babies aji.d young children.
5n several case^ the child marked for de
portation was one of a family of three
Of four, [n such case? the mother and
i*:* hfaHhy members of the family were
landed and 'shipped to the Russian colony
near Ix>s- Angeles. The father was or
riered deported with the ailing child. In
V.ss the Government interferes they will
leave- here on Saturday on the steamer
fÂ»an Juan and in a few weeks will be
lar.ded at Panama, , penniless, friendless
and unacelimated. With a little proper
i are. sunlight and fresh milk, the dis
ability which, under the law, now bars
Jiieir entrance to the promised land, will
disappear-. Until it disappears, however.
The Federal doctors are helpless unless
"arrangements can be made to postpone
tbe date .set for their deportation.
Meanwhile the Russians, who are a
clean, healthy appearing people, are re
ceiving every consideration and while
they stay here their burden will be made
s< light as possible.

Tomatoes were the only description on the

and controlled by a few dealers, who were
exacting high pric*s for the Â»iuck. The other,
vegetables were in freft supply and generally
weak.
Receipt? of river Potatoes continued light
and the market for that linj of goods was
in better Shape, there being a good inquiry
for shipment to outslci* points. Prices were
no higher, however. Salinas Burbanks were
in increased supply and rath?r easy. Onions
were inclined to easiness, all shipping orders
having been filled. The steamer Sonoma took

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
market followed the issuance of the *monthly.
crop report, at Washington. Preceding tht
statistics the market was quite steady. "Tfte
opening for the September option was a shade
higher to 14Â® Uc lower at S2%(gS3%c. 0n a
moderate demand from commission houssfe iha'
price advanced to S3%c. The relative nrrnnpes
was due partly to decreased movemaxu^ of
wheat in the Southwest. Receipts to-atty at
St. Louis and Kansas City were 227.000"bush
els against 424,000. bushels a year ago. An
other influence sustaining the market was hot.
damp weather in the Northwest, a condition
conducive to the development of black rust.
The volume of business, however, was .not
large, the fact that the Government report
would be made public about the middle of the
seseion seeming to act as a check on early
trading. When the condition of spring-sown
wheat was announced the figures were found
to be several points higher than had been gen
erally expected. The percentage was 89.^ as
against Wl on July 2. - Using 16 bushels as
the yield and figuring the acreage at 1i.b1.t,
000. the total yield or tprins wheat would be
in the neighborhood of 250.000.C00 bushels
For winter wheat the Government statistics
indicated a yield of 424,400,000 bushels, making
a total wheat crop In the United States ot
674,700,000 bushels. The bearish tone of the
report started active selling by pit traders and,
commission houses. As a result prices broke
severely September declining to Sl%@Sl%c.
Subsequently the market regained a portion
of the loss on covering by shorts, but the close
was weak with September down l@l%c at
Sic ' ' \u25a0 \
Notwithstanding the break In wheat the
corn market held steady the entire session.
The Government report had little effect, bep
tember closed about unchanged at 53*jC. .
OATS â The market was flrm early. Later
sentiment became somewhat bearish as a re
bult of the Government report. The market
closed easy and unchanged at 2S%c.
Provisions lacked support from packers and
in consequence the market was a trifle easier.
At the close pork was off 7%c, lard was un
changed and rits were off 2%c.

through- each one of the question* and
commented on each. \u25a0\u25a0 Then â¢ he wnid,

into (he-room. ' V
"I want to state to the commission that
I did not' give the questions out to. an
other living person except , to these two
board members. I wrote the questions
and answers' by' typewriter myself. I
have told the whole truth of this affair."
DUXX COXTR AI'iICTS MAYIIKW.
Then came the testimony of Dr. Dunn,
sharp and bitter. "I was standing in. the
hallway just before the examination in
anatomy, but the statement made by Dr.
Mayhew that I talked, to him, asked him
for the questions and received them, is
an absolute falsehood. I was talking to
Dr. Papjvidre in that hallway,, but I told
him not to be worried, that the questions
asked him would be general, such. as. the
bones of. the head, muscles of the body,
and head, nerves" and the like, that if he
had read up on these subjects he would
pass and if he", had not read up he did.
not deserve to pass. That was all I ever
told him regarding the' examintlons." \u25a0\u25a0> ;
"Dr. Dunn," queried Senator Lukens,
"uid you ever receive anything of value,
or was anything of value given to a third
party for you, outside of your legal fees
to affect any act of yours as a member qf
the board?" "
"Not once." \u25a0 *
"Did you give out any questions before
the .anatomy examination; or have you
ever given out the results of those exam-,
Inatlons to any one?"
"I did not. I have served on this board
four rears and during that time I have
not done an Irregular act. I did not
give out any results either here or at
Los Angeles." â¢ .
"Is Dr. Mahew friendly or unfriendly?"
"He is unfriendly. I discovered that
fact last January." ;-.,*,%\u25a0-'.*
"What was, the paper, you held In your
hand when you were talking" to Dr.
Papandic?" ;.>:.** -'"\ .
"That was a communication from the
student body asking that their percent
ages be given out before the board went
to Los Angeles. ;-,;< y
BRANDS TESTIMONY AS FALSE.
Then Dr. Cool took the stand. He was
direct in his denial of the charges made
by Dr. Mavhew. He admitted . that he
did talk to Dr. .Mayhew during the
chemistry examination, but stated that
at the time he wore a heavy coat, while
Dr. Mayhew said that he. did not remem
ber what Dr. Cool wore.
Dr. Cool denied that Dr. . Mayhew gave
him the anatomy examination in ad
vance and branded the testimony of
that member as an absolute falsehood.
He also said that Dr. Mayhew was un
friendly to him.
There was considerable parley over
the question of the breadth which the
oroEs-examination of the witnesses
should go, and Commissioner Pillsbury
limited it . for the . time being. Full
cross-examination will be alldwedlater.
Drs. Dunn and Cool, with. Attorney
I.ukcns, desired an adjournment until
next Monday, but the "solid five" ob
jected and they carried the-day.
It wan here that Dr. Herrick made
hia statement regarding Dr.-Cool's-so
cial engagements. Dr. Cool .â pleaded
for delay because he was incliargre of
the midsummer high jinks of the Bo-
hemian Club. The excitable ..Herrick
was on his feet In an instant. '. "I want
to state," he cried, "that the , social
functions of Dr. Cool have caused half
the troubles of this board. Time after
time he has hurried matters .'so that
he could attend some social- affair. It
became so bad that I went to the Gov
ernor of thie State to complain and to
get a stop to it."
THINKS COKE DOCKETED MONEY.
The mornins's session was feature
less. Dr. J. A. Brooks 'swore- that he
had heard Dr. Steele say that he had
paid some one,, whom Brooks. .thought
to be Dr. Coke', $150 to get him a li
cense, and that he did not have it yet.
Brooks gave It as his opinion that Coke
had pocketed the money. He. also stated
that he had called on Dr. Coke and
asked him about his standing in the ex
aminations. He salO that Coke rang up>
two telephone numbers, East 784 and
Red 3701; telephones of Drs. Cool and
Dunn respectively, but thatfh'e got no
answer. Coke nover referred to Dr.
Dunn at all." \u25a0.'
Dr. Brooks was upbraided by the
commission for not giving this evi
dence when it was asked of him at the
first examination. In turn the. witness
accused the commission of- being skep
tical; over 'his testimony.
The session will resume at 9 o'clock
this morning. ,'.' \u25a0 ' \u0084'\u25a0\u25a0"---
PUTATIVE AATIVE SONS
: ARE ;.BAXISHED .TO CHIM4.
Chief of Police Coffey of Sacra
mento must be tried by the Superior
Court on the charge of malfeasance In
office, according to a decision handed
down yesterday by the Supreme Court.
The capital city's head peace officer is
accused of allowing "faro, roulette,
Klondike and other gambling ganies"
to run openly in violation of the law.
It is stated by the prosecution that he
knew the' gambling In question was un
lawful and that he willfully refused to
perform his evident duty.
The Grand Jury preferred a formal
accusation against him and the matter
was taken up in the Superior Court.
Coffey argued that his alleged derelic
tion fcould lawfully be considered only
by the municipal Board of Trustees.
He petitioned the. Supreme Court to re
strain the Superior- Court from pro
ceeding with the trial, and a temporary
stay was granted. The prosecution and
the offense were each given an oppor
tunity to demonstrate the justice of
their respective positions by oral and
written argument before the Justices.
The court holds that possibly the
Board of Trustees \u25a0 and the Superior
â¢Court may have concurrent jurisdiction,
but that in the present instance Coffey
should stand trial. \u25a0
; The 'case Is analagous to that of the
Election Commissioners . of: San Fran
cisco, except that in this city the ac
cused officials stood trial before the
executive branch of the municipal gov
ernment before the matter, was for
mally brought to the attention of the
judicial department. The Election
Commissioners claim the Mayor has
concurrent jurisdiction with the courts
and that they are free from further
prosecution, on the ground that the
city's chief executive got "a lick In
fust" in their behalf. That Is a ques
tion, however, which Is given to the
Supremo Court and not to the Election
Commissioners to settle.

of IÂ»Â«-:it:tl Examiner* and which seeintt
to have caused the trouble* which have
brouicht about the preÂ»ent State Inves
tigation of Us affairs \raÂ» brought
out with Murtlins vividness yesterday
afternoon *â¢. lu-n Dr. Mayhew took the
witnceM ntand aud swore that two fel
low incmlier* of the board, Drs. Cool
uud Dunn, had asked for and received
(he Â«;Â»iÂ«"f ions iv miiitnmy In advance of
the examination given the students.
His testimony wait yet hot on the rec
ord when Dr. Dunn Moully denied, un
der <i:n!i, the accusation made by Dr.
Maybew and stated that he bad never
seen (lie evaintnntlon questions written
owl ou paper until they were produced
yesterdity before the commission. In
no lets spirited manner Dr. Cool re
futed the charges and aware tbnt he,
tiMÂ». Maw the written questions for the
first tinte when thej- were offered to the
com mission.
The lie was passed direct by these
members of the board. The Commis
sioners muFt decide among them. Dr.
Dunn swore that his feeling toward
Mayhew was . unfriendly â this in no
hesitating manner. Dr. Herrick made
the statement that it was the social en
gagements of Dr. Cool .'which caused
most of the trouble in the board.
ALMOST COME TO BLOWS.
While this court was hearing the tes
timony of Dr. Cool there occurred a
little episode on one side of the room
which threatened to make this war of
words a real fietic battle between a rep
resentative from each of the rival
camps. When Dr. Dunn left the stand
be walked over to Dr. Mayhew, who '\u25a0
was standing on the outskirts of the j
crowd, listening to the new witness. !
"Dr. Mayhew." said Dr. Dunn, plunging
headlong into the frigid zone around
that one, "don't you know, way down
deep in your heart, that when you told
the commission that you gave me those
Questions that you were lying?"
"Dr. Dunn," flashed Dr. Mayhew in
reply, "you know that I was not, and
â¢when you testified tliat I did not give'
the question to you you were a malig
nant liar."
"That's enough," hissed the thor
oughly angry Dr. Dunn. "We'll settle
this outside after the adjournment."
"That. will we;j yon can bet tnat rll
be there to settle it only too quick,"
was the answer from the representa
tive of the solid five.
But there was no tight. Commission
ers, newspaper men and attorneys lin
porod after the session. Bets were
made quietly, for although Dr. Dunn
\u25a0would be classed in the heavy-weight
division in professional ranks nnd Dr.
Mayhew -would only be a welter-weight,
yet the fighter from Palo Alto has
youth and agility on his side, and many
gray-haired Fports were willing to
place their money on his chances. The
odds were at even money.
The bout was not pulled off. Pos
sibly the intended participants were
afraid of police interference or possi
bly their passions cooled, for they left
the building separately and when last
soÂ«>n were miles apart.
SWEARS HE GAVE aUESTIO.\S.
Dr. Mayhew testified that he was
conducting the chemistry examination
on June 12, when Dr. Cool entered the
room and began to joke with him,
asking , "What do you put on next,
rdayhew?"
"Anatomy," Dr. Mayhew replied.
The rest of Dr. Mayhew's testimony
was as follows: "Dr. ' Cool' then asked
me when the examination would take
place and I told him the next day.
"Have you the questions with you?' he
aÂ«>ked. 'Yes.* I said, 'here in my pocket,'
'Will you let me see them?' 'Certainly/
and I took them from my pocket and
gave them to him. Dr. Cool put the
paper in his inside pocket and left the
room, BmokJng his cigarette and talk-
Ing to I don't know whom.
"He kept tbo*e examination* in anat
omy Trblcb I liad grlvcn him for fnlly
tiro hour*. I don't know irhat he did
with tbpin during that (Imr, but I want
the commisston to understand that he

Questions.
. Ex-Chief of Police George W. "Witt
man has been offered the. task ; of -re-
organizing the Panama State police.
The. proposition was made to him by
the Government through its local con
sul, Alegrando de la Guardia.
As Wittman holds one lucrative posl-*
tion and is about to engage in the'
plumbing â¢ and electrical contracting
business he. was obliged to decline the
honor. The Consul is trying to find
another man capable of .the position,
but: has not been successful and has so
notified his Government. A short time
ago the Panama Government decided
to reorganize its police force and look
ed about for some one who was com
petent to undertake the job. All the
police in the State are directly under
"the Government and not under munici
pal supervision, and the renovation of
the' force and. Introduction of modern
methods is a great undertaking for a
single man. American methods seemed
preferable and as soon as the Govern
ment's plans became known the name
of ex-Chief Wittman was immediately
submitted.
. Wittman's reputation as a Chief and
commander is well known, and the
Consul urged him on behalf of the Gov
ernment to" accept the duty, offering
him the privilege of making his own
terms. : â¢
Wittman declined. He first disliked
the. idea' of- leaving San Francisco and
the climate of the country was not
enticing. \u0084 He 'is now manager of "<he
San Francisco Electric Protective As
sociation ' and i under his direction its
business has been-, picking up rapidly.
Recently the ex-Chief joined with the
firm of Scott, Lym'an& Stack, Sacra

plumbing and electrical contractors will
be conducted in this city, at 331 Grant
