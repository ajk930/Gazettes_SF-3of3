not prob-iblr that Bunkers will

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 6.-After an the
â¢ tones that have gained currency with
respect to the nature of the confession
Tn niÂ« y - T CT Senator < Harry Bunkers
(k AUOmty Seymour, it is de
clared by those best informed that The
can s version is the correct one and that
the confession really deals only with the
four originally accused Senators. Bunk
ers has not told the District Attorney
any wonderful tales about corruption in
-m i^f e fc b * yoad the Â»ncldent in

figured, and if he had the District At
torney of Sacramento County in all prob
ability would not deem it his business to
attempt to support the Btories
The scare occasioned by the stories of
.Bunkers' confession led William Haub
and George Egan of this city to with
draw from former Senator WriehT's
bond of $10,000. Wright was brought up
from San Jose by Under Sheriff Ed
Reese, at 11 o'clock to-night, appeared
before Judge Hart, furnished other sure
ties and was released. His new bonds
men are William Beggs and E. V. Hunt
both of San Jose. Detective O'Xelll ac
companied the negro legislative attend
ant, Arthur Lee, to San Francisco this
evening to enable him to secure sureties
on his $1500 bond. Lee is held -as a wit
ness in the Emmons case and will testify
to having seen the marked bills given to
the accused Senator.

Attorney H. V. Morehouse of San Fran
cisco to-day had his first Interview with
his client, former Senator Harry Bunk
ers, since the latter is reported to -have
made his strange, confession. At the
conclusion of his interview at the County
Jail, which lasted several hours. Attor
ney Morehouse said: "So far. as I
can gather the situation v simply \u25a0\u25a0 is
this: District Attorney Seymour and
hss detectives have been diligently en
paged for months past . working on
threads of evidence in- connection with
the cases of the accused Senators and
have gathered a mass of statements,
many of v/hich they deem of value to
them in the forthcoming trials.
**TJio District Attorney has closed
upon Bunkers, and^ has told him of
what he has learned-j In some Instances
the District Attorney has desired th-j
confession of Bunkers himself as to
the truth of the statements secured. He i
has told Bunkers that the latter h ( es
been convicted and in Jail, and that his
case to that extent Is closed: that no
harm can comÂ© to him by making state
ments -which will aid In the present
action of the remaining case, that par
ticularly since the District Attorney
promised that In no event should Bunk
ers' , statements be used against him in
the ev*>nt that a new trial in his caso
Is ordered.'

the subject and secured other % testimony
upon it, which he told Bunkers in his
talks with him.
"I do not consider that the District At

in this matter. I do believe there has
been a little too much of the pyrotech
nical in this whole affair, but I do hot
think the District Attorney has acted im
properly in his relations with Bunkers,
my client. As is the practice in all such
cases, I warned Bunkers not to talk; if
he had cared to do so of hie own free

have promised Bunkers a pardon, for
only the Governor can grant that. 1 knew
this was false as soon as. l read it in a

Special Piscateh \u25a0 te- The CalU -
SAN JOSE, Sept. 6.â Former Senator
Eli 'Wright, one of 'the quartet of boo'd
ling Senators, was arrested this afternoon
and taken- to Sacramento by Deputy
Sheriff Reese, his bondsmen having sur
rendered him. Deputy Sheriff Reese ar
rived here early this morning from Sac
ramento.and began a search for Wright,
but it was not until this afternoon that
he. was located in the office of his attor
neys, Partridge. &' Jacobs. Bunkers^ con 7
feesion had" frightened , his bondsmen,
George Eagan and C. AV.Haub, and they
notified Sheriff Reese at Sacramento last
evening that they wished to surrender
Wright. The Sheriff at once dispatched
his Bdn to this city to arrest Wright.
Wright, in company with his attorneys
arid the deputy "Sheriff, went in search oÂ£
bondsmen. By 4 o'clock he' had secured
as bondsmen William M. Beggs, an at
torney, and E. V:' Hunt, a groceryman on
Delmas avenue. These bonds were ap
proved by Judge Hyland of tfie Superior
Court.
At 4:40 o'clock Wright left for Sacra
niento in company' with Deputy Sheriff
Reese, as he could not secure his release
until the bonds were also approved by
Judge Â«lart. Wright seems greatly dis
turbed and worried over the incident. He
refused to talk of the matter other than
to say there was no truth in the confes
sion of Bunkers so far as he was con
cerned. .
Attorney Partridge said that if Bunkers
had made such a confession as is report
ed it only strengthens Wright's case and
Wright was farther from the penitentiary
than ever. '
The transfer by Wright of his* property
to his wife is believed to have alarmed
his bondsmen. On September 1 Wright
borrowed $1500 on, his home. Since the
trouble Wright has been diligently study
ing Spanish and intends to. go to Mexico
when he frees himself of the charge.
Mrs. Wright accompanied her husband
to Sacramento.

NAGASAKI. Sept. 6.â The peace
news was received without enthusiasm
in the chief centers of Klushu prov

chagrin that Japan has been deprived
of the rightful fruits of victory, and
there is disappointment especially at
the fact that permanent security from
Russian aggression has not, been ob
tained. The diplomatic failure is con
sidered to be due to the negotiations
commencing prematurely.

NIAGARA FALLS. N. V.. Sept. 6. â
The United Typothetae of America con
tinued its convention here to-day. Re
pofts of "routine nature" from various
committees were taken up and acted
upon, but the one absorbing topic of
discussion and conversation was the
demand of the printers for the eight
hour day. The convention is solidly
opposed to the demand. There seems
to be no sign of weakening the posi
tion of the executive committee taken
yesterday, namely, not to grant the
eight-hour day under present condi
tions.
This afternoon a telegram from J.
TV. Bramwood, secretary of the eight
hour committee of the International
Typographical Union, announced that
President Lynch and Vice President
Hayes of the eight-hour committee
would be in Niagara Falls to-morrow.
It was resolved that courtesies of the
convention be extended to Messrs.
Lynch and Hayes when they arrive.

ATHENS, Greece. Sept. 6. â The recent
discovery of a depot of arms, explo
sives, bombs and infernal machines in
the vaults of the Armenian church here
has led to the unearthing of what the
police believe to be a widespread plot
on the part of the Armenian revolu
tionary committee to compel the inter-,
ventlon of the powers to stop Turkish
oppression in Armenia by starting a
series of outrages. Incriminating docu
ments were found pointing to the ex
istence of other depots. A number of
Armenians have been arrested and the,
police "are actively' prosecuting "art in
quiry into the affair.*
The authorities say that evldenca'
found on the men arrested shows that
they received large sums of money
from the Armenian committee in Amer
ica, and it is also stated that the in
quiry has established the connection of
a number of Bulgarians and youns
Turks with the plot.DAVID LANDAU

NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â Max Loeb, who
also travels under the name of Conn, who
is known to his pals and police as
"Sheeney Mike," and whose picture is
In the Rogues' gallery, is in a cell at the
police headquarters because he posed as
Mr. Anheuser, the millionaire brewer.
and, incidentally, walked "away with a
roll of Jl5O belonging to David Landau of
Ban Francisoo.
The too-conflding Landau, who sells
eiphons as a business, arrived from the
far West on August 17 and put up at the
Grand Union HoteL
The next morning, after breakfast, he
eat down in a chair in the hotel lobby
to smoke and think. A few minutes later
a well dressed man apologized for having
accidentally Jostled the San Franciscan
and engaged him in conversation. He
learned his name and occupation, etc., and
left.
A moment later a second stranger
dropped into the chair vacated by "An
heuser." He had opened a conversation
\u25a0with Landau when "Anheuser" returned
and would have retreated in view of the
new arrival, but Landau insisted that he
eit down. This he did, and. after a few
moments, suggested something to drink.
At the bar. after drinks had been
eerved, the stranger tendered a $5 bill to
the bartender.
"No, >no, no! Certainly not!" exclaimed
"Mr. Anheuser." "I ordered the drinks."
"Oh! I insist the drinks are on me," de
clared the other man.
"Not at all! not at all!" persisted "An
heuser," and there was a briÂ«f war of po
liteness.
Landau took a roll of $450 from his
pocket and was on the point of paying
himself.
"Tell you what I'll do," broke in "An
heuser," laughing. "I'll take the roll and
the 55-bill and pay for this round myself
and two more at expense of you fellows."
Suiting his action to his words, he
'cached with one hand for tie bill and
v.c other for the roll.
"That's the way to do It," he said, as
he executed a step dance along the bar.
â¢while Landau and the other man turned
to each other and laughed heartily at the
amusing situation.
"Just a moment," shouted "Anheuser,"
as he disappeared.
Lar.dau and his companion waited at
the bar, but a number of moments passed.
"He's not coming back; I believe he's
stolen my money," said the stranger.
"Where has he gone," asked Landau,
being alarmed.
"You ought to know. He's your friend,"
replied the stranger.
"He's not my friend," retorted Landau,
"and I'll hold you till he comes."
"You bet your life you won't," said the
stranger, darting through the doorway.
Landau went to police headquarters and
looÃetl over the photographs. Among
them he found Mr. "Anheuser." Detec
tives Kane and Collins found "Sheeney
Mike" on Forty-second street, and x^an
dau identified him as the man who took
his roll.

CLERKLY MANNERED DOCTOR
SUPPOSED TO HAVE ELOPED
Doctor Robert C. Howe, who Was formerly a dapper clerk at Kibbler's Phar
macy, is supposed to have deserted his wife and eloped with a pretty seven
teen-year-old girl. He cannot be found by his wife or the Board" of Health,
which lately made him a sanitary inspector. ;
Robert C. Howes
Wife Sits Waiting
for Spouse.
Board of Health
Suspends Him as
Inspector.
Said to Have Gone
With a Pretty
Young Girl.
Dr. Robert C. Howe, who was re
cently appointed a sanitary inspector,
is among the missing. The Board of
Health cannot find him," his wife says
his whereabouts is a mystery, and
those who know him best are wonder
ing.
For three days he has not communi
cated with his wife, has not visited
his accustomed haunts, nor has he re
ported for duty as an Inspector.
After interviewing Mrs. Howe and
making other inquiries the board sus
pended its appointee pending investi
gations.
Those best acquainted with Howe
firmly believe he has lost his head
over a pretty 17-year-old girl. Her
home has always been with her par
ental in the vicinity of the delinquent
sanitary inspector's residence in the
Western Addition. . Perhaps her home
is there now, but she was absent last
night and Inquiry elicited the state
ment that she was visiting her sister
In San Jose. %
Questions as to whetner she and Dr.
Howe might have eloped were met
with excited denial. As there is no
conclusive proof of an elopement the
young woman's name is withheld.
Dr. Howe was for many years a phar
macist at Kibbler's drug store, at Turk
and Larkin streets, where he was known
as "Doc" for many months before he was
admitted to practice, for he took for
treatment little cases "Just to please the
girls." % .
He wore a Bilk hat, a Prince Albert coat
and cultivated manners that pleased
young and susceptible hearts. He was
always known as quite a \u25a0 masher. -
When he finally becanW ,a doctor he
moved from his humble lodgings in a
back room on Golden Gate avenue to bet
ter quarters, invested in more clothes,
trimmed his hair, cut off his waxed mus
tache, grew a Vandyke beard, then cut
it offâ probably to please the young wom
an supposed to be his companion during
his present hibernation.
His disappearance in the way suggested
by his friends would not surprise those
who know the magnetic young lady
whose name Is coupled with his, for the
dapper little druggist-doctor of clerkly
demeanor is known to be an easy mark
for the fair breakers of masculine hearts.
Whether he has gone for - a lodge in
some vast wilderness or for an outing to
the South Seas the abandoned wife and
the Board of Health do. not know.

EXTRADITION
MEANS DEATH
Remarkable Case Is t Being
Heard Before federal Com
missioner in Los Angeles
N
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 6.â Through zeal
in the cause of Justice Antonio JFeliz of
Los Angeles and a citizen of ' Mexico faces
the grim likelihood of being taken back to
his native land, stood up before an adobe
wall, and shot by a squad of soldiers. He
is making a desperate effort to save him
self from extradictlon and certain execu
tion, and his case is one of the most pe-
culiar that ever has come up between two
governments. Feliz assisted a , Los An
geles policeman to capture a Mexican
criminal wanted here. The authorities
did not desire to take the chances of
awaiting due process of law to extradite
their prisoner, so Feliz kidnaped him at
San Diego and brought him here. On that
charge he is wanted in the sister republic
[ and his offense is punishable with death.
Feliz was taken before United States
Commissioner Van - Dyke to-day,, but
it will .be several days; before/ that
.official reaches his decision, and then,
if he orders extradition, perhaps two
weeks.more 'will elapse while the nec
essary formalities between. the United
States and Mexico are gone through
with. In 'the interim this poor Mex
ican, perhaps overeager in his desire to
aid the law in this country, lies jn a
felon's cell in the County Jail, know
ing as surely as though he had heard
his sentence fall from the lips : of a
Judge, that the infliction of the dearth
penalty- upon him in a terrible man
ner is not far off, unless unforseen cir
cumstances arise to keep him away
from Mexico. He has retained strong
counsel and is overlooking 'no legal
technicalities, but' the officials who
have looked: into his case say there is
little chance of his preventing extradi
tion. -

v CHARLESTON,; 8. C, Sept. 6.â The
British : steamship Tropic, 2340 tons, Cap
tain Barber, arrived in .this port to-day
after a voyage lasting nearly â¢ three
months. The second mate, purser and
fifteen seamen^are missing/ Sailing from
.Valparaiso, Chile, June 21, the' Tropic met
with bad weather at once and 4 on June
28, while off Cape Putu,. and about fifteen
miles from Constitution the ship went
hard aground not- more than 300 .yards
from the beach. /
High seas were running. The second
mate, purser and fifteen seamen put out
in . the first lifeboat for Constitution for
aid, but 'never returned. All n|ght the
seas dashed, over the Tropic and the
twenty men on board momentarily ex
pected the end. Morning brought hope in
the sight of men-*on shore, 'but there
seemed no way to get to the ship. The
captain with a kite sent a c.ord to shore
and 1 next a line and then : a hawser
reached the land. Over,this the men went
ashoro. When" the storm abated some
what the vessel was found tfo be undam
aged. A naval court, at Talcahuano ex
onerated the captain and crew.
The, grounding Is accredited to a devia
tion of the ship's compasses arid the prev
alence of a strong inset current off Putu.
in latitude 35 09 south and longitude 72 20
west. The Tropic was twenty-eight days
overdue and a cable from Valparaiso to
the Maritime register dated June 29 said
that she would be . a total wreck. '. .

i Her demand is based on alleged ser

her petition^ * Miss Wood tipped off to
Platt all the inner workings of the office

POLITICS MUST

Labor Statisticians' Conven
tion Says Commissioners
Are Hampered in Work
MEETS ON TAMALPAIS
Second Day's Session Marked
by Fervent Discussion
of Vital State Problems
"What is needed in the labor bu
reaus of the United States is less pol
itics. With politics eliminated and men
of wide judgment selected to fill the
office, a greaser work could be accom
plished. Give the Commissioners po
litical freedom and an- unhampered
choice of their assistants. Give us a
universal system of gathering statis
tics."
These were the words uttered by
Commissioner Bair of Pennsylvania
yesterday at the'Tccond da^s season
of the twenty-first annual convention
of the Association of Officials of bu
reaus of Labor Statistics of America.
There followed a lengthy and ardent
discussion of whether the work of the
labor commissioners had been rajuly
worth while in the past.' '
This second day's session was held
on the summit of beautiful' Mount
Tamalpais. Thanks to California's
Commissioner, W. V. Stafford, and the
California Promotion Committee, the
trip 'was so arranged that the dele
gates, who come from the four ends
of the Union, could transact part of the
enormous business before them and at
the same time view the grandeur of
the Marln scenery. Wives and chil
dren accompanied the delegates, mak
ing the day a sort of business picnic.
CRITICIZES ttOVEUA'MEXT.
Yesterday's meeting brought out the
.first real discussion of the value of
the State departments of labor and the
amount of work which they had ac
complished. The debate waÂ« started
hy Commissioner G. J. Shoenfarber of
Maryland, who criticised the statistics
gathered by the Federal Bureau be
rause they were not plain enough to
the ordinary citizen. Charles P. Neil,
Federal Commissioner of Labor, de
fended the statistics in question, main
taining that the statistician had no
right to make the deductions from his
work; all that he should do was to
put down the reliable' 4 facts. The dis
cussion which followed seemed to take
the trend that It is best for the Com
missioners to make deductions- so that
the masses of the people, who -have not
the time to spend weeks studying Â»he
records, coulo. tell quickly the results
Which those figures proved. Commis
sioner Shoenfarber cited the instance
of the statistics gathered during the
recent Investigation of municipal and
private ownership of gas and electric
plants. He said tuat because the fig
ures were so complex and as there
were no deductions made by the riÃatis
tlclan, he and his fellow-investigators
were unable to ascertain from them
which form of ownership was the most
desirable.
Intiia reports of many States it was
shown that many of the Commission
ers not only had to gather statistics,
but had to see that the labor laws were
enforced as well. \u25a0 This, it was argued,
is not fair to the Commissioner, for
no owner will give vital statistics
when he knows that the man to whom
he is giving them will turn around and
prosecute him for disobeying -exiptfns
laws. It is likely that recommenda
tions will be made to the Legislatures
of the various States to have the', sta
tistical oftiee and the labor law enforc
ing office made foreign to each other.
"Divorce them," said Commissioner
Stafford.
TO I'JIOSECCTE BABE HIRERS.
The reports from the States showed
the different conditions of labor which
txist in each. Maryland boasted that
there was not a sweat shop in the city
of Baltimore, the tnird largest clothing
manufacturing city In the world. Com
missioner Stafford said that there were
Â£.000 more children in the schools this
year than there had been in previous
years â this the result of the enforce
ment of the rhlld labor law. "In Call
fornfa we are bound to enforce the
laws as well as to gather statistics." .
he declared, "and I say divorce the
two. But as long as the law requires
me to do both I am going to see that
both are accomplished as far as can
possibly be done. I have said 'please
cease' to the factory owners who have
been employing children in the past.
Most of them have complied. I will
take steps to accomplish the arrest
and prosecution of those who have not.
1 am happy to state that the labor con
ditions in California are better than'
in most States, and equal to those in
any section of the United States." .
WELCOME BY GOVERNOR.
The following Interesting letter from
Governor George C. Pardee to Commis
sioner Stafford was read:

DETECTIVE ON STAND

garding "Billy" Taggart
Special Dlsi>atch to The Call. ,
WOOSTER, Ohio. Sept. 6.â Fred Dow,
who gave his occupation as a detective
and his home in Cleveland, was the
principal figure in the Taggart divorco
case to-day. Dow said that. ;he had
been employed by Captain Taggart to
learn what he could' as to Mrs. Tag
gart's conduct' with "Billy" Taggart.
Dow told of a conversation with
"Billy," during which "Billy" took a
package of letters from his pocket and
said :
"These are trom my sweetheart, and
they will be her death warrant -if any
one gets hold of them." ' r
On another occasion he said that his
sweetheart was a grass widow with a
wealthy husband, and that she kept him
well supplied wth "dough." He said
that they were going on the road ln n
fhow as soon as the trouble was over.
Later : Dow said. "Billy" told him his
sweetheart was the wife of Captain
Taggart; that the stories about her
were true; that if put on the wit
ness stand they would swear they
were lies, and swear to things that
"would make tha devil blush."
Mrs. Taggart's attorneys tried hard
'to make it appear that Dow was a fel
low of bad repute, nnd charged that ho
was in the employ of an ex-convict,
who was conducting a detective agency,
and that his employer was now under
arrest in Cleveland for felony.
Late this afternoon Captain Tag
gart was put on the stand. He denied
that any person was with Mrs. Taggart
and Lieutenant FortescuÂ« when they
came out of the collar at Fort Leav
enworth. Asked if he had said any
thing to Mrs. Taggart about a re
volver, he said;
"I told her that it was my intention
to shoot Fortescue if he came home
with her."
On cross-examination Taggart re
lated an incident pf the time when h*
invited a young lady to ride in a sleigh.
When he told Mrs. Taggart she slapped
him on the face and said: â¢ - .
"Take that with her the next time
you co with her." .
Taggart was still on the stand when
court adjourned.
Mrs. Taggart will be the first witness
ln rebuttal to-morrow. Arguments may
be reached by Friday.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6.â The War De-.
partment is awaiting the determination
of the Taggart divorce suit, now in prog
ress at Wooster, Ohio, before proceeding
to take military action in tne case. Gen
eral Miner, whose name had been drawn
into the case by the captain's attorneys,
has preferred formal charge* against
Taggart, and a recommendation has
been -made to. -the general staff jby
the proper authorities that an in
pector be detailed to make a thorough
examination of the testimony, . so far
taken. The general, staff has 6imply sus
pended action upon this recommendation
"until the determination of the suit, but it
undoubtedly will be approved, and upon
the report to be submitted by the inspec
tor will hinge the department's decision
as to whether th'ere'shall be court-martial
proceedings, and whether in such case
not only Captain Taggart, but other offi
cers whose names have been drawn into
the case shall be placed on trial. .

For in the success of that business both em
ployer and employs has an equal interest, for
its failure, or even its partial failure, retracts
upon both; and the failure, or even the partial
failure, of even a single business, decreases
by that much the total prosperity of the coun

even a personal, . interest, v
In discussing- the scope of your office with
me you have always said that it should be so
managed and conducted that to.it should turn,
for information and with implicit confidence
in the correctness ot the information, those
who for any reason might desire to know the
condition of any industry of th* State. With
this statement of yours I moot heartily agree.
And I hopÂ« that those Interested will-, soon, if
they have not already, come to recognlre that
your bureau is always Â«.t their service to.fur
nish them the information which may ! enable
them to deal Intelligently with any threatened
disturbance in the industrial world.
DISPUTES FROM IGNORAXCE.
I think that it may be safely said that no
thinking, patriotic man, be be employer or
employe, really â¢ desires ' to take from any one.
that which is not rightfully hfs own. 'But it
often Happens that being uninformed regarding
their own and others' rights and not having
a correct knowledge ot the conditions really
existing, and therefore governing, disputes
arising between employer and employe which
lead to bad - results to both and therefore j for
all and which, were both informed as to the
real, conditions^ would never have occurred.
It' is "to if urnish sources from which such
dispute preventing information may be ob
tained that the various State bureaus of labor
statistics are, I take it, established and main
tained." If they, have* the confidence of thÂ«
employer and employe, if from them is given
out such information as will establish ".and
maintain that Intelligent and hearty oom
munlty. of interest and feeling, which should
exist between all employers and employes,
then I am sure the labor bureaus will have
done that for which they have been estab
lished and will do much to bring about and
maintain that industrial peace And good will

izen, TTithout : exception, has a. very great .in

MANY VETERANS
ARE EXHAUSTED
Aged Warriors Find Exertion
of Marching in Grand
Army ' Parade Too Great
DENVER CHEERS THEM
Survivors of the Civil War,
Fifteen Thousand Strong,
Tramp-Side by Side Again
DENVER,, Colo.", Sept. 6.â The main
event of the Grand Army encampment,
speaking from the viewpoint of the rank
and file, was the grand parade which oc
curred to-day. To the veteran the privi
lege oi again treading in step with com
rades, of the bivouac .of '61 is one for
which no .hardship seems too'' great to
undergo, no ordeal -too severe to under
take. Many who marched the two miles
to-day were exhausted when '\u25a0 the ' end
was reached, and many others, weakened
by age, fell out of- line long before the
Journey was completed. These tottering
veterans, regretting their inability to re
main in tne parade and giving every evi-.
dence of , their ' feelings, would be cared
for by tha persons nearest at. hand, led to
a place wnere they could rest and recover
from their exhaustion. It was a common
sight to see a gray-haired old soldier sit
ting on the curbing gazing wistfully at his
more sturdy corajades as they passed
him by, '
The ovation 'given the marchers was un
stinting. ... The streets were 'packed with
people, and the windows and roofs of
the buildings along the line of march
swarmed . with humanity. . The cheering
was continuous, and the grizzled old war
riors were kept busy bowing acknowledg
ments, and raising their hats in courte
ous salute. - '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0"\u25a0. : :
Th,ree hours were consumed by the pro
cession in. passing the grand stand. Colo
nel Harper Moorhead, chairman of the
parade committee, stated that 15,000 mem
bers of the Grand Army participated in
the parade. Kansas carried off thÂ« hon
ors for the largest representation, having
nearly 2500 men in line. v .
The most perfect arrangements possible
for communication and emergency service
were provided. Telephone stations were
plated along the route of march, and phy
sicians were in attendance every block or
co. A horseman j was unseated by -his
frightened mount, and In falling broke a
finger. A surgeon stationed near by had
seen the accident, and the man was
astride his animal and in line again be
fore the procession had progressed two
blocks from where the accident occurred.
General Donaldson of ' St. Louis was
Btricken with heart failure "and was'car
ried to a hospital in an ambulance. His
recovery is doubtful. There were many
interesting features connected with the
parade, but the' most impressive was the
appearance of an ex-Conrederate soldier
In the gray uniform of his fighting days.
A great cheer rent the air as he stood
alone ln a carriage waving the Stars and
Stripes and bowing to the multitude.
Both the national encampment of the
Grand Army of the Republic and the an
nual meeting \of the' Woman's Relief
Corps will open to-morrow morning.
Numerous schemes for entertaining the
thousands of visitors- to-night were
worked out by the committee on enter
tainment. A run by the entire Fire De
partment; during .which' -Roman candles
were discharged, attracted a great crowd.
Throughout ."â¢ the evening. gWst . dances
were .rendered - by . bands of Indians, in
full costume: of warriors, 1 as, they rode
about the downtown .. districts on street
cars from which seats had been removed.
A reception was tendered Commander-in-
Chief General King at the Brown Palace
Hotel by the ladies of the Grand Army

OF SUPPDSEED HIGHWAYMAN
\ William Sampson, a
â¢ teamster, is supposed to
have been carrying on
operations as a highway
man in Goldeui Gate
Park while ostensily dri v
ingfor pleasure with his
wife and baby*. He is at
the Emergency Hospital,
suffering trom a bullet
wound supposed to have
been inflicted by Harry
Foley, an intended vic
tim. His wife, suspected
of being an accomplice,
is also in custody.
William Sampson Is
in Custody, Also
His Wife.
Police Say Robber
Operated With
a* Buggy!
Mystery Surrounds
an Encounter in
Lonely Spot.
Going driving in the park with his
wife and baby nights and holding up
after-dark pedestrians in the -pleasure
resort, much as a man steps from his
buggy to bag a few rabbits. Is a prac
tice of which the police accuse William
Sampson, a teamster, living at 759
Howard street.
Sampson Is lying guarded at the
Central Emergency Hospital, suffering
from a bullet wound alleged to have
been Inflicted by an Intended victim.
His wife is detained in the matron's
room at the City Prison, charged with
being an accomplice. The Sampsons'
baby, who had no idea that papa was
out as a human panther looking to
prey on his kind on the dark stretches
of the park roads when she went bowl
ing along with him and her mamma,
shrinking at the mist wralth6 out by
the ocean, is also under the matron's
protecting care.
In connection with this strange case
some one at the park station will have
to explain why Harry Foley. -who is
supposed, to have wounded Sampson
in the park Tuesday night, was ac
cused of being a liar and arrested on a
charge of carrying a concealed weapon
when he told at that station how he
had just fired four shots at a man who
had tried to hold him up in the park.
The police believe that they have In
Sampson the man who has been the
terror of strollers in the park after j
nightfall and who has committed the !
several robberies that have occurred
there recently. There Is no direct' evi- '
dence that he is guilty, but circum
stances point toward him as the high
wayman, and the police believe they
can at least fasten upon him the crime
of attempting to hold up Foley. Their
belief is that Sampson has been oper
ating by getting out of the buggy
â¢whenever he* saw a likely looking pe
destrian and. after committing a rob
bery, rejoining his wife, who had
driven on. The baby, it is supposed,
\u25a0was taken along to add a etill more
Innocent appearance to the family
driving party. - N
SHOOTS AT THE ROBBER.
Tuesday night, Foley, who'has some
notoriety as a pugilist, was, according
to his story, walking in the park with
Miss Florence Handley at 10 o'clock
at night, when a man with a white
handkerchief over his face stepped out
of the brush and. leveling' a revolver
at him, ordered him to throw up his ;
hands, at the same time telling Miss j
Handley not to make a noise.
Foley pulled a revolver from his
overcoat pocket and commenced firing
at the footpad, wao ran into the brush.
Foley flred four shots. A buggy con
taining a woman and a child flew by
Just then. Foley and Miss Handley
went to the Golden Gate Park station,
where he told his story. A hurried
Investigation was made and the con
clusion reached was that Foley was
prevaricating. Under instructions of
Lieutenant Kelly, a of carry
ing a concealed weapon was booked I
agrainst Foley and Miss Handley was
allowed to go home.
When Policeman James Foley ar
rived at the police station to report
for duty a few minutes after Harry
Foley had made his report he said he
had heard four shots. near the Garfleld
monument and about .four minutes
later a woman with a child in a buggy
had driven rapidly past him, opposite
the tennis courts. '
The police say that Sampson went
into the saloon of Buckley & Stewart
at 760 Howard street, opposite his resi
dfiife, after the affair by the ) monu
ment, and told Buckley that while he
v.as driving in the ,park with his wife
and child ahout 10 o'clock he had been

to San Diego, and brought here. . Cap
tain/Petersen and" five others of. the
crew, are oh San Miguel .Island. Mate
Pottersoni gives the following version
of; the disaster:
"'About 10 \u25a0'\u25a0 o'clock. Sunday 7 night
'while 'Sailing -before the wind at about
nine miles an hour in r one of the thick
est fogs ; I ever experienced, we struck
a rocky reef on San Miguel Island. Be
fore, the we had not seen the
sun' for- thirty-six hours, so thick was
the7weather, and had to sail by dead
reckoning. The Coleman â¢ passed . over
the; first, reef and. now lies between
that. and another one. I think she is
severely damaged. The lumber can
probably be saved. She is In no imme
diate danger of further damage unless
the wind shifts to the' southwest. . She
is only kept afloat by her lumber
cargo."
The Coleman is owned by the Pacific
Lumber Company of San Francisco.
She ; is valued at ahout $20,0.000, and her
cargo is -worth $10,000." She was built
in Port Blakeley, Wash., 1888, and
her gross tonnage is 463. She is 167 feet
longr, 37 -feet wide with a depth of hold
of 11 feet. Captain -Charles Petersen,
master of the Coleman. Is a resident of
Sah7 Pedro," and has a N wife and child
residing here. It. is probable that one
of the^tugs of the iÃannlng Company
will be", sent to her assistance.

Man Who Toyed With Dig
nity of Levi Moran Escapes
Imprisonment and Fine
BERJvELEY, Sept. 6.â "Bumping" at
a social dance is not an offense punish
able by fine or imprisonment, according
to Justice Edgar, who to-day dis
ckarg'eft William Krupitzer. a tnilor of
Korth Berkeley, wijo was arrested on
Augustus by Deputy Marshal Moran.
charged by that officer with having re
peatedly bumped him while a dance
was in urog-ress.
Deputy Moran was not on duty and
had neither star nor brass buttons in
evidence, wearing instead the conven
tional black and having with him a
lady, with whom he da.need. When
Krupltzer bumped into him, and then
bumped" him-again, and yet a few more
times. Deputy Moran wondered whether
the offending tailor knew whom he was
bumping. t
Moran gave his testimony in the case
to-day, saying: '"ThiÃ Mr. Krupitzer
disturbed me repeatedly during the
tenth dance at the letter carriers' ball
on \ug-uet 12, in Native Sons" Hall, by
bumping- my back. The first four or
five bumps I ignored, thinking the man
might have bumped me accidentally.
Later Krapitzer seemed to be trying to
trip me with his feet. I suggested that
he use more care, but when the next
dance i^as on Krupitzer began to bump
me again! He bumped me until I was
tired. .Xx the conclusion of the dance
I invited, iiim outside and Informed him
that the bumping mast cease. I also
asked him if lie knew who I was and
showed him my star. He Said he knew
me well'enough. A crowd gathered. 1
tried to get Krupitzer into another
room, and he hit me. The crowd piled
on toi) of us, but I got Krupitzer out
and took him to the station. That
was ail."
The ladies who danced with Moran
end Krupitzer gave their testimony.
Clara Bartel and Alice Gallagher said
they experienced the bumping and
knew it had disturbed the dancing.
They differed, however, in ascribing the
responsibility to Moran and Krupitzer,
respectively.
Krupitier swore that Moran had
spoken, to him while the dance was on,
.but he thought iloran was apologizing
for Dumping iuto him (Krupitzer). Th.c
bumps appeared to have been pretty
evenly* distributed, and Justice "Edgar
ordered the prisoner discharged.

TOBIX WINS A FIGHT
Goes Back to Position That
Has Been ; Tossed Around
Like Dancing Shiittlecock
OAKLAND, Sept. 6.-^-The Board of
Police and Firt Commissioners to-da/
appointed Policeman 1. D. Tobin to be
bailiff of Police Court Department 'Z.
This is a permanent appointment, and
settles the bittledore and -shuttlecock
Srame over the position which has beeu
In prosre?Â«s in Chief 'of Police Hodg-
Ifins' office for months. The board's
action Is a distinct \ victory for Tobin
over the Chief of Police. Twice has
Hodgklns removed Tobin from the post
only to see him restored.
Tobin held the place for many months
to the great satisfaction of Police Judge
Samuels, for the patrolman has no llf-
UÂ« cUrlcHl ability. Suddenly Chief
Hodgkins remo% ed the competent court
oincer and Installed another policeman.
L'nable' to learn whence came the rea
son for the change, Tobin went back
to street duty. In a short timÂ« Hodg
kins received a strong intimation from
high sources that Tobin be restored.
The ousted bailiff was returned to his
former poÂ»t. but remained there barely
thirty days before a second order turn
ed him out again. Exasperated by
the Chief of Police's conduct, the board
settled the bailiff's status .this morn
ing. At police headquarter? it Is not
believed that Hoagkins will again iin

PIN OF ORDER
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND, SÂ«pt. 6. â "To be or not to be" â
a green tree or not a green tree, was the
question that was Fettled and unsettled half a
dozen times this afternoon during the Oakland
Club's discussion of the club pin. The design
submitted and adopted is a circle bearing tbe !
inscription, "The Oakland Cltfb â 1S00," and
inclosing a tiny oak tree, which restf on a
bar on which is the word "Service." The
club colors, which were changed to-day from
lavender to green and gold, were to be shown
in the pin and the bone of contention that fur
nished the members with food for arguments
for a good hour and a half was thÂ« tree,
some insisting that as green was the natural
color of a tree, green it should be, while oth
ers maintained that gold alone would please
the artistic eye. If I remember aright the
gold advocates won out. In any event, the |
pin is of & neat, tasteful design, and the

This evening at 8:30 o'clock Miss Ada Lay
mance became the bride of Edward Hall Dodge
or Alameda in the presence of nearly 200
guests. This wedding was one of the most
brilliant events of the season, no effort hav
ing been spared to prepare a charming envi
ronment for this first bride in . the Laymance
family. Although the eldest of four girls, thÂ«
bride looke even younger than her twoscore
years and was a dainty, girlish picture in her
exquisite bridal costume of satin messallne
and point lace. A long veil fell over her -fair
hair and a great armful of orchids and lilies
of the valley completed a charming picture. '
Mine Blanche Laymance, In a brocade mee

her sister as maid of h0n0r. ... Her frown, was
made In close fitting Princess style and was
one of the prettiest seen this season. â¢ 'â¢ She
carried Bridesmaid rosee. ; t
A sextet of bridesmaids, all gowned alike. in
the daintiest of pink moussellne frocks and
carrying armfuls of tiger . lilies, preceded the
bride. This girlish escort consisted of Misses)

at Mills. Mr. Dodge was accompanied by

Combined Cut Will Make
a Total of Nine Cents
Lower Than Last Year
I OAKLAND.' Sept. 6.â T,he Board of
Supervisors to-day : unofficially. H fixed
upon the tax rate for the ensuing^year,
which is to be.sl 40 on every $100! worth
of property inside incorporated towns
and $1 80 on all the outside districts.
Last year these figures were $1 49 in
side and |1 84 outside. This is a" gross
reduction of 7>4 cents on the inside dis
trict, but in reality a net reduction of
4V&'iCents, for an additional 3f3 f cents
had to be levied for school purposes.
The. State tax, however, has been low
ered 4% cents, making a' total reduction
of 9 cents.
The meeting was held to-day, as Su
pervisor John Mitchell expects to be
away when the matter is finally acted
upon, but he wished to have a voice in
the. fixing of the rate and an Informal
discussion of the rate was gone into
Land the matter settled pending official
action later. The various funds â¢ for

PROXIES USED
BY CHURCH MEN
Faction in Presbyterian Cori^
' gre^ation Scbries Victor^
Witlf Md of Old Device!
BERKELEY. Sept. 6.â The introduc
tion of proxies by the handful at
a meeting of â¢ the factions of
the First Presbyterian Church last
night to be used to decide the
question of whether the church prop
erty was to be sold to the Methodists
or not created a scene not entirely dis
similar to that observed >at political
conventions,, when proxies sometimes
play an important and unexpected part.
: The proxy-holders, for the most part,
favored selling the property 'to the
Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church and'
they^cored a decisive victory over, the
factibn which strenuously opposed such
a sale. The conservative folk' be
lieved the property should command; a
price of at least $30,000, and, as this
was practically prohibitive, adherence
to that figure meant the retention by
the Presbyterians of their property. The
so-called "liberal"/ side desired to sell
the property and build anÂ«jw in North
Berkeley. The "liberals'; won, wlthlthe
aid of a "barrel of proxies," tv use.'a
phrase employed by the disgruntled
minority. - . >â¢
\u25a0 After the meeting, which was stormy
at times and abounded in suggestions
of . "political; scheming, and , ."wirer
pulling," etc., members of the defeated
minority were not slow to intimate that
the proxies which worked theirundoing
in the hands of the opposition were ob
tained, in scores of instances, from chilf
dren, who, while <? members of the
church, did not really* know what use
was to be made of the proxies so .easily
obtained. . *: ; :,.â¢;.
, These allegations were strenuously
denied to-day by J. C. Ford,; a, promi
nent leader of the "liberal" faction, who
had a lot, of proxies and used them to
help along the sale of the church. ;
-"It- was fair enough to use the
proxies," said Mr. Ford. "Both sides
would have used them: v We simply'de
sired to bring out a representative vote
of the church. Children's proxies were'
used, to be sure; but no misrepresenta
tions were employed to' get , them.^ The
trustees were outvoted at a
of 'the congregation ; a -few weeks ago,
when the board reported in favor, of the
sale of the property ; to the Methodists
for $22,500. We, believed the majority
of the church favored the sale ond pro- !
ceeded to 'demonstrate " it,Â£ > procedure
in which we ..were : successful. - -.The
Methodists, supposedly, will accept the;
$25,000 offer and the church will be'

The: first: assembly." arid {welcome of the
Jfresh man class of Stanford University
was held to-day" in- assembly hall, Dr.
'J. G." Branner. delivered, the address arid
gave a 'cordial greeting to the entrants.
> The ;'pointVin the 'advice Â» and â¢criti
cism on.'which Dr.' Branner dealt most
Strongly was the life in the, fraternities
and 'sororities and also high living else
where. In :the university. In regard to
the fraternities he said: , .
VI want to lay some Btrew upon the habit
of fpendlns- money aÂ«. practiced nowaday* in
college. Fortunately for. many of you the
problem of expenses Is. already solved, and you
are to ** congratulated, but other* of you are
so unfortunate aa to be more fortunate. % Xou
have ' only to write to Indulgent parents for
more Â« money to pay .. for v books, lor for fees.
or for a board blur and It comes. This money
Is spent -In some cases a* If you wÂ«re the sons
and' daughter* not- of frugal parents but of
nabotu and princes. â¢ And-, not .only Is 'Bis
money poured out for extravagant dress, ex
pensive . furniture, superabundant \ liTery rigs,
spread*, dances, card parties \u25a0 and all Â» n Â« f. 1;
companlments of * college high life, but Dills
are run ; ift> .with "liverymen and tradesmen
without due regarditp-"-when and how they are
to be Bald- But If those Of you. who are dis
posed- to^ be ' overfree with your money will
look about you- among your fellow-students I
am -confident -that you will ccÂ« reasons enough
to -reconcile \u25a0 you to ' leading a simpler sort of
To the fraternity and sorority people;gener
ally I bey to offer a : word of kindly meant ad
vlnce In this connection. .The lives that many
of you rare leading are/, in 'my opinion, alto
gether too itrenuousL Â» Such devotion to pleas
ure-seeking Is not in keeping with' the spirit or
purposes of university education in this coun
try, and it is not good for you either as organ
izations or as individuals. Fraternity life has
come to be vastly . more expensive that Is
either necessary or reasonable, and this ex
pensiveness is kept up not by the necessary
requirements of the organizations, but by child
ish rivalries in display. And in aome instances,
while you are here spending enough money to
support an ordinary family, back there at
home are father and mother working early
and late, saving and denying themselves in or
der to pay these indulgences of yours.
I do not mean to imply that extravagance
ie confined to the fraternities and sororities â
not by any manner of means. -If I were at
all disposed to think co I should only have
to look toward college athletics to be com
pelled to enlarge my views on the subject.
And I would also have it distinctly under
stood that I do not. believe that . extravagance
is especially characteristic of student life In
this university." But' l do mean to cay that
it is the business of our students and our
faculty to deal with it as it. is practiced on
our own campus.
Dr. Branner read a communication
from the absent head of the university,
in which Dr. Jordan stated that he
would arrive upon the campus either
Sunday afternoon or Monday of next
week.
The advice given to the entrants was
diverse . and ; treated thoroughly, every
possible phase of university life. Fresh
men should â¢ before attempting to pro
ceed in their college career learn to
control both body, and -mind:' Students
in selecting their , respective courses
should consult an able adviser, pre
sumably their major professor. -The ad
vice given by^ well-meaning classmates
often is designed to cover but a limited
part of the university career and often
leads the misdirected entrant into dif
ficulties, which could easily be'evoided.
Freshmen should endeavor not to seek
the path of the "least resistance," but
should pick the course which will bet
ter fit -him 'or her to undertake the life
work. A "pull" is not to be desired
in beginning life, as hard work and a
good reputation are the winners in the
long run.
Conscientious work and not "cram
ming" is' to be strlved for. Too
much pleasure is usually the downfall
of more students than any other cause,
while nothing but study Is' equally in
jurious.
The more - specific directions given
the freshmen and upper class men dealt
with the conduct upon the "quad" and
the" ' campus and in the dormitories.
Sophomores were advised that as the
elective system is strongly in favor at
the university it would be In accord
ance with the ideas of the faculty that
if a freshman declined to elect a 'course
in twilfght tubbing the course should
not be forced upon him. This and many
other 'humorous remark 3 brought
sounds of stifled mirth from the "co
eds" and broad grins from the sterner
sex. - '
' E. A. Cu'nha '06, president of the stu
dent body, made several suggestions as
to the stand which should be taken by the
students as a whole to Insure the re
spect of., other universities and to pre
serve the high standing of Stanford.
Reference was made to the need of ad
ditional strength in, the coming strug
gle with the blue" and gold in football,
track and 'baseball, as this season will
mark .the' first ''time that the campus
system has brought the Intercollegiate
contests upon the home campus. The
"meeting was enlivened throughout by a
sprinkling of songs and bursts of cheer-

' . SAN. MATED. Sept. - 6.^-Tna -.question
of securing a. tourist hotel, for. this city
is. again', a. matter", of .earnest-consid
eration 'here. | ' The .* hotel committee,
which was appointed shortly after tha
dent ruction of the Hotel Maleo, has re
sumed its sessions after a period of
inactivity -, and has nqw .under discus
sion several- sites and Improved prop
erties, which with a small outlay may
be made entirely* suitable for the pur
pose. - â¢ -\u25a0.-.- . > -
' The - committee, which Is composed
of L. R.Doe. Joseph Levy. Thomas R.
Turner, General ;R. H.."Warfield arid A.
Sbarborov -has discussed
plans to bring the matter to'the atten
tion of capitalists, and. It Is believed
that success will shortly crown their ef
forts. It is practically settled that tha
site upon which the Hotel Mateo stood
is too small for .the needs of the pres
ent town and for the rapidly Increas
ing tourist traffic which is coming this
way. While several other properties are
under consideration, the Hayward man
sion suggests itself as the best of them all
and efforts will be made to secure It.
There is now practically no question
that this splendid place, one of tha
finest in California, will be sold by tha
heirs of the Haywards. The magnifi
cent furnishings of the great homa
have been removed and sent east. Un
der the immediate direction of Mrs.
W. J. Dingee the furniture, painting*.
fixtures and priceless brlc-abrac have
been packed and sent to the Eastern
home of Mr. and Mrs. Rose. This seems
to determine the future of the - man
sion as far as it might have been a
summer home of the Rose family.
STANFORD DORMITORIES WILL
HAVE LIGHTS ALL NIGHT
New Syfttem Will Be Continued, as It
la Found to Be More Economical
Than Former Plan.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. Â«.â
It was to-day officially announced -that
the lighting of the dormitories. Encina
Hall and Roble Hall, would be carried
on under the system in effect tem
porarily the latter part of the last
semester. This will mean light until
12 o'clock.
The practice up to the present term
was to supply the current until 10:30
p." xtL. From this time on the "dfgrs^
would be obliged to depend upon the
"midnight oil." The- treasurer of tha
university has reported that the pres
ent method will prove more economical
than the one previously. In effect Inas
much as '. the students formerly .never
undertook to switch, oft the current; In
the rooms, as It .was expected that the
main line would be disconnected at the
regular time. This practice resulted In,
unnecessary \u25a0waste,. as the lights werÂ«
frequently allowed to burn In all rooms
whether occupied or otherwise from
the time of the turning on of the cur
rent until 10:30. ,'_"' â"'\u25a0
"With the new method the ' student
will ordinarily retire before the. ex
tinguishing of the lights and will
therefore disconnect the current In, tha
room. As it is not expected the.stu
dents will wilfully waste the electric
ity, it is Impossible that the lights .will
be allowed to burn In the early part
of the evening before the student is
ready to make use of them. It has al
ready been found to be far mora Â«ooi
nomlcal than the old method. - . \u25a0r- â¢-**J-~ < *.'

The office of the registrar of the Stan

AIRSHIP MEETS
WITH A MISHAP
Big A eroplane Constructed
by Professor Montgomery
Is Damaged at Sacramento
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« C^il
SACRAAtENTO, Sept. 6.â Professor John
J. Montgomery's aeroplane met with a
mishap at Agricultural Park at 6:30
o'clock this evening. A test was being
made preparatory to the public flight an
nounced for 11 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing. Rgbert DeFalca, a balloonist, was
placed in the aeroplane and a balloon had
raised it eighty feet in the air when a
sudden south breeze struck it and caused
it to careen. The Jolt threw DeFalca
against the delicate constructed machine
and .".Â»s shoulder snapped one of the main
ribs. This caused the aeroplane to lose its'
equilibrium and strike the earth in a lop
sided fashion. It was found that. one of
the rear wings was broken in the fall. De
talca was unhurt.
At last accounts t-e balloon which was
cut free was speeding northward and
farmers in wagons were giving chase.
Professor Montgomery was doubtful as to
whether his bird-like contrivance could
be repaired in time for to-morrow's ex
hibition.

BATTLES FOE LIFE
WITH MOUNTAIN LION
Mendocino County Hunter
Narrowly Escapes Be
ing Killed.
UKIAH, Sept. 6â While out hunting
last Saturday Hi Williams of Cummings
had a very, narrow escape from being
killed by a mountain lion. He had sat
down to rest at the foot of a rock butte
and was watching an object that ap
peared to be a deer farther down the
gulch. Several stones rolling past him
finally attracted his attention to things
closer home and on looking around he
was confronted by the blazing eyes of
a huge mountain lion. On .the. impulse
of the moment he discharged his rifle
Just as the beast sprang, but the bullet
only wounded the animal. The accuracy
of its spring was interrupted, however,
and the lion landed just beside him arid
knocked him down. The animal was on
him in a second and the fight for life
was begrun." "Williams,, who is a very
powerful man, succeeded in holding the
infuriated animal at bay until he could
reach his gun, and, pressing the muzzle
against its side, succeeded in killing itK
The lion measured nine feet from tip td;

FRAUDULENT NATURALIZATION.
SAX FRANCISCO is not the only American seaport in which
Americans have been crowded out of seagoing by the fraud-;
ulent naturalization of foreigners. There has been much dis
cussion of the scarcity of Americans in the responsible and
licensed positions in our merchant marine. Ship masters and mates,
engineers and other officers on ships must have the license of the
Federal Government in order to follow their calling. By a system
of fraudulent naturalization these licenses have been obtained. Those
who hold them are quick to join certain affiliated organizations
where they have the power to outlaw non-members, Americans who
are rightfully licensed, by preventing their employment.
The system is worked for all that it is worth, and it is worth,
to those who work it, every licensed place in the merchant marine.
By influences not difficult to trace, the law, has been made to pro
vide that an applicant for a license must have the indorsement of
two already licensed officers. It will be seen at once that by this
provision and by the power of organization it is made possible for
a ring holding fraudulent naturalization papers to control ? these
licensed positions, and to nullify the license of the United States held
by real and lawful Americans, by the simple process of making
tbeir employment depend upon a qualification other than the license
and unknown to the law of the land.
It is said that a quarter of a million men are voting in this
country on fraudulent naturalization papers. In that number are
Known to be hundreds and suspected to be thousands ,who are
enjoying licenses, land rights and other privileges reserved by the
law for lawful citizens only. A secret service agent has discovered
long prevalent and sxstematic fraud in naturalization in San Fran
cisco. These aliens who have deceived our courts and stolen our
birthrights by perjury have been found holding licenses as pilots,
ship masters and mates and marine engineers, positions which be
long to lawful citizens only. No wonder Americans are not found
in responsible places on American ships.
The matter is of more than usual interest because one of these
aliens, caught red-handed holding a position with fraudulent papers,
now presents himself to the court as an applicant for legal naturali
zation. He has passed the five years' probation . required, all the
lime guilty of a felony by using the privileges of a citizen by fraud,
am 1 now asks to be legally made a citizen of the country whose laws
he has violated, whose citizens he has wronged and whose asylum
he has treated with dontempt. Naturalization papers may be issued
by any court having a clerk and seal. But American Judges have a
considerable discretion. If an applicant for naturalization be asked
by the Judge "Who is President of the United States?" and he
answer "Mayor Schmitz," the court may refuse him his papers. It
is, however, not necessary to resort to catch questions. The law
requires that an applicant for. naturalization "shall be a man of good
moral character, attached to the principles of the constitution of the
United States and well disposed to the good order and happiness
of the same." The law also provides: "If any person shall falsely
make, forge or counterfeit, or cause or procure to be falsely made,
forged or counterfeited any certificate or evidence of citizenship,
every such person shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of felony, and
being convicted thereof by due course of law shall be sentenced to
be imprisoned and kept to hard labor for a period not less than three
nor more than five years."
It is evidence of the extreme cheapening*of our citizenship that
a man guilty ofxthe immorality and felony of fraudulent naturali
zation, liable to imprisonment for five years in the penitentiary, has
the effrontery to apply for legal naturalization. The court in its
discretion may decide whether such a man is of good moral charac
ter and attached to the principles of the constitution. If he can be
lawfully naturalized now, and go unpunished, the agent of the Gov
ernment who has searched out this gang of fraudulent citizens may
as well quit work and return to Washington.
In similar investigations in New York it has been shown that
fraudulent citizenship is offered as a premium to intending immi
grants from Southern Europe. No other country has ever permitted
such trifling with its very life as this. The facts revealed show that
we need a concurrent revision of our immigration and naturalization
laws. When unlawful citizenship is offered as a bonus to immi
grants it is time to take notice. '
PRUNES AND GEOGRAPHY.
THE Department of Commerce and Labor issues a bulletin on
the prune production of the United States. By, this it appears
that we consume 100,000,000 pounds of prunes in a year. The
supply, formerly imported, is now produced in California, with a
surplus of 10,000,000 pounds which we have for export.
The bulletin highly and truthfully compliments the California
prune and then takes an excursion into geography. It says all of
the prunes grown here are produced in Southern California, where
the soil and climate are so perfectly adapted to the perfection of
that fruit that other sections may not hope to establish competition.
Continuing, this official geography lesson says that of all the South
ern California counties Santa Clara has been found to possess the
cream of all the qualifications needed to yield prunes. Of course
this bulletin as prepa ed by some niechanical compiler in .the de
partment, and is printed and issued as routine work. The Secre
tary of Commerce, Mr. Metcalf, being a Californian, would have
used his blue pencil on it, but he never saw it. He lives in Alameda
County, and Santa Clara joins it on the south, nearly 500 miles
north of that fine region known as Southern California. The Santa
Clara prune has made the prune juice of France turn green with
envy. It is one of our leading fruit products and is a specialty of
Northern California as the orange is of Southern California. It is
therefore the soil and climate of Northern California 'which make
the prune feel perfectly at home, and this prune soil and climate are
the special endowment of Santa Clara.
The geography of this bulletin suggests the need of more Cali
fornians in the statistical and matters of fact bureaus of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor. Unless this is brought about
Southern California will be jarred some day by a bulletin on citrus
fruits, locating their production in Humboldt County and informing
the world that the soil and, climate there are peculiarly adapted, to
produce the finest oranges and lemons in the world.
The < Department of Agriculture once issued a bulletin on Cali
fornia products wliich entirely ignored our most important crops.
Upon inquiry it was found to be the routine work of a clerk who. did
not know a pomegranate from a potato. Since then that department
has been careful not to blunder about the agriculture and horticul
ture of this State. The Department of Commerce is now put upon
its caution in the same respect.
The man who sent the bombs to Messrs. Schiff and Guggenheim was
tome one \vho!had lost money in Wall street, it is suggested. But that
clew doesn't narrow the inquiry so very much. â New York World.

Passenger Elevators the Latest

ARKASGEJIEVT OF THE ELEVATORS OX â¢AN OCEAN LINER.
i , â¢ â¢ -
DASSENGER elevator on a ship! Who
ever expected to see such a thing?
1 With the ever-increasing size and
carrying capacity of the great At
lantic liners, however, elevators have at
last become a necessity, as much so, in
fact, as in a hotel seven or eight stories
high, says the Philadelphia North Ameri
can. \u25a0 ' Â»
Accordingly, the mammoth new Cunard
liners, now nearlng completion for the
New York route, will each have two pas
senger elevators.
When one considers that these ships
will be ninety feet from keel to the
highest deck, or the height, say. of an
eight-story building, it is readUy seen
that the question of vertical travel be
comes a serious one.
Seven of the eight decks of the new
vessel will have passenger accommoda
tions. Six of Â«.nese will contain quarters
for the first-class passengers. Four will
be above that which will contain the
dining saloon, so that there will be, of
necessity, a great deal of travel up and
down.
When ships carried passengers upon
only two decks, or three at most, there
was little need for elevator service, but
"FINDINGS KEEPINGS."
Justice of the Peace Gottlieb Grau
bert of Wheatley, in this bounty, had a
case to decide recently that was vof
considerable Importance, to the plaintiff
at least, says the Le Sbeur, Minn., cor
respondent of the Chicago" Chronicle.'
Henry Tifflan bought a gold watch
of H. L.. Drie, a jeweler of Wheatley,
some time ago, and when he had car
j ried "the watch a few days became dis
satisfied with it, took it back to Drie
and demanded repayment of the price,
$90. -
. Drie declared that the watch was all
right and refused to repay the money.
The men quarreled, and finally Tifflan,*
in a rage* threw the watch over the
showcase on the floor and walked
out, saying: "There is your watch.
Keep it, .and I'll sue for the money."
Drie shouted after him that he would
not accept the watch and that he might
sue as soon as he wished. ,-
Herrman Coffman of Wheatley was
in the store, and after Tifflan had gone
out he went around behind the counter
and picked up the timepiece, saying he
needed a watch himself and that if no
one wanted this one he would take : it
along.
Tiffian did sue Drie. for the money,
but was defeated, and then he demand
ed the watch from Coffman, who re
fused to give it to him on the ; ground
that it is the law that abandoned per
sonal property belongs to any one who
cares to pick it up.
Tlfflan then sued Coffman before Jus
tice Graubert to recover the watch, but
the Justice held that there is no ques
tion whatever that Coffman is correct
in his view of the law, and that Tifflan
has no further property rights in, the
watch. . Â»
Tiffian's lawyer could show no - au
thorities to the contrary, and no appeal
will be taken.

maddeningly slow ' in ! seeing reasons that
a woman : grasps at onceâ who doesn't
think he wants you to do this, and can't
see the good'of,that. ' s ' "
-I like to dress prettily, and I know what
suits men.' ' I { should , be f resentful of a
husband who; ne\"Â«r; noticed what I had
on; but the man who_ notices a woman's
dress thinks ; he ; has 'an : opinion on the
subject, and that opinion. In my experi
ence, is always a mistaken one. A woman
dressed by 'her husband is always a
fright. Nothing shall induce me to be a
fright if T can 'avoid it. .
I may say, without, conceit, that I am
tolerably; popular in society. I have al
ways a pleasant : number of men about
me when 1 go out; they ask me for
dances ; they hold my fan and my gloves
when I sing; they run my, errands, and
seem delighted to do anything for me.
I'm not the slightest bit of a flirt, but
I.confess to finding all these little at
tention very pleasant.
Now, if I marry, there's an end to all
that. If he were an indifferent husband,
and liked me to j receive attentions from
other men, I should not care about him.
If he resented other men's j attentions to
meâ and most husbands do that, I notice
âI should be left neglected, and devoid
of all those little attentions that oil the
wheels of life; forâ girls, mark my words!
âhow many husbands do you find who
pay little' attentions to their wives?
The marriage ring seems to be a talis
man that transforms a smiling, delight
ful, devoted lover into a grumbling,
grumpy, too often impolite husband. Now,
I like civility, and don't feel disposed to
exchange the politeness of j all the world
for the discourtesy of one particular man.
Then, again, I prefer to retain a man's
good opinion. I notice that before a wom
an, marries a man looks upon her in the
light of 'an angel; she has not a faultâ
or, if so, other people's faults are her vir
tues. She really forms so high a standard
of feminine perfection that all other wom
en fall 'short beside It. â¢
But directly she marries, what a change
comes over the spirit of his dream! Who
hears a husband praising his wife's
beauty, her accomplishments, her sweet
ness of temper, her remarkable quali
ties? True, you may say that it would
be in questionable taste for a man to
praise what is part 'of himself; but can
he y not at least accord her that unquali
fied praise wheih comes from mere
absence of blame,? . .\u25a0.. \u25a0. , '
I don't even ask that a man should be
blazoning his wife's perfections abroad to
all the world, I only ask that he should
tell her of them, now and then,
j, A man is ready enough to tell a girl
'whdm t: he is In love with that she is an
angel."\Why is it that men so seldom tell
their wives so?
|No;' these things being as they are, I

WHY NOT LETPARENTS DECIDE?
:A little chtld passed away the other day
in: San Francisco as j an .. unfortunate re
sult of being vaccinated. Or, if this is a
misstatement of the case, and if a ma
jority of physicians will stand ready to
testify that the death was not due to
vaccination, "I think that nobody will
dispute the assertion that the little one
would have been alive to-day if he had
not been vaccinated: \u25a0 Some two or three
years ago there were more than, two
dozen deaths from tetanus, if my memory
serves me right, in a small New Jersey
community, and in every instance thi3
lockjaw followed I vaccination. It may be
a matter of strict Jostice, in this connec
tion, to announce that the physicians
there were Immediately to the front with
an announcement calculated to allay the
feara of lay people that the vaccination
had something to do with the tetanus
and the deaths; but it is a disastrous
fact that the deadly disease followed ino
culation with the vaccine virus, and It
took place in no other Instance.
You need not consider these facts an
argument for or against vactination un
less \u25a0 you choose, but indubitably they
lead to one question: If parents prefer
that their chUdren should take the
chances of smallpox rather than those
of tetanus, why should they not have
the privilege of decision in the matter?
As mighty a nation as Great Britain,
after studying this matter long enough,
has decided that they should have*" the
privilege, and vaccination laws are
stricken from her statute books, pre
sumably forever. .'<:]Â£' -.

CHAP THAT PAYS THE BILIj.
WHEN your head is somewhat
larger than you fancied it
could be; '. *
When you find you lack a nickel where
- you thought you had a V;
When you're fixed on reformation, and
announce it now begins;
When you're feeling quite remorseful
' for your multftude of sins;
When, in short, you've rather wandered
from the straight and narrow
path,
And are feeling you're a sinner and are
destined unto wrath.
Here's a maxim that should 'fit you. as a
coat to ease your chills:
E'er the chap that does the dancing is
: the chap that pays the bills.
There's pleasure in the ruby wine, or
In the game we play;
The swishing of a petticoat may set our
wits astray;
An eye may /smile responsive when it
" , really should not smile â
I've often heard about these things,
though not, of course, my styleâ 7
We may 'have a time vermlllion, as per

AGAINST DOCTOR ORLOW
Plaintiff "Testifies He Was Hired to Shadow Women That De
fendant Might Blackmail Them, but Charge Is Denied.
â¢Thomas Kullujian lost his first skirmish
ir his battle with Dr. Orlof N. Orlow
yesterday, when Justice of the Peace Van
Ncstrand pave judgment apralnst Kullu
jian. who had sued Orlow and the Inter
rational Society of Human Endeavor for
V'tO alleged to be due for eerivces ren
dered.
Kullujian proved a valuable witness In
fcfs own behalf, and incidentally be
fmirched the name of one woman whom
be paid he had shadowed by order of Dr.
Orlow, who got J2OOO from her the next
day. At thÂ«Â» conclusion of the trial Dr.
Orlow branded Kullujian's statement as a
falsehood.
The case was enlivened by several
clashes, one of them between Arthur
Barendt. attorney for Kullujian, and
Bradford Webster, the private attorney
for Dr. Orlow. At the conclusion of the
morning session, during which Barendt
Jiad ascertained from Kullujian the char
acter of his services, which consisted,
KuMujlan said, of shadowing lady mem
bers of the society, then reporting' to Dr.
Orlow, who. he alleged, resorted to black
rr.ail, Webster remarked that no gentle
man would conduct the case as Barendt
had done. The latter in turn called Web
ster "a d little scoundrel," but no fur
ther hostilities ensued.
Kullujian charged that Webster was a
member of the United Arts and Crafts,
another concern over which Dr. Orlow
presides, and Webster retorted by calling
Kullujian a liar. These amenities did not
occur while court was in session, so the
offenders were not lir contempt.
tnCUUBJIMX ON THE STAND.
Kullujian was on the stand all morn
ing, and after testifying that he had been
employed by Dr. Orlow to shadow the la
dies of the Human Endeavor Society,
said he had followed some women to
housrs of Chinamen. Kullujian said ho-"
r;uit h?s work after he realized Its dirty
character. Kullujian said that his other
duties consisted of decorating the chapel
of th<* society at Orlow'a residence, 3440
day street.
When L*. ML Hoefler, Orlow's attorney,
esk<-<! Kullujian if he had not admitted
that Orlow did not owe him any money,
Kullujian replied, that "Orlow was a rob
ber and a thief, and not a Russian Prince,
bs he claimed to be,"
Bloch difficulty was experienced in hold
ing JKullujian In check when he was tes
\u25a0\u25a0tffying, and the name of the lady whom
hÂ» charged with reprehensible conduct
flipped out before he could be stopped.
David Burkhardt testified that he was
employed by Dr. Orlow in June, 1903, to
"shadow" a lady, whose name he was
about to divulge when he was prevented
by a vocTTerous objection from Hoefler.
Barendt said he desired to show that Or
low had hired men to follow certain
women members of his Eoclety. Burk
fcardt did not think much of Orlow's rep
utation, but when an affectionate and
fraternal letter written by him to Orlow
liad been cresented in evidence Burk
hardt said he had since changed his
mind.
FEW PAYING 3IEMBERS.
Mrs. Frederika George, treasurer of
the eoclety, said that the receipts
during- eighteen months were only 5156,
and her statement that there were few
paying members brought smiles In the
courtroom.
Mrs. A. Haste, a member of the bo
clety, said Kullujian worked for Orlow
and not for the society, and some $20
collected last Christmas was turned over
to the doctor for distribution to the poor.
Mrs. Haste said she had heard Kullujian
pay that he was going to pay back Orlow
for all he had done for him as soon as
he" won his suit against M. B. Mihran, a
ruÂ£ dealer.. Miss Grace Wakefleld, who
had resided at Dr. Orlow's home and also
Fald shÂ« attended his services In the
chapel, said some kind words for him,
and also said she had seen Kullujian
decorate the chapel at various, times.
Dr. Orlow was the last witness. He
denied that he owed Kullujian anything.
Orlow paid be had taken the young man
10 hi? home out of charity when he was
hungry, had fed and clothed him, and
given him odd sums of fifty and seventy
five cents a day for his work. Orlow said
Kullujian left him and took with him a
list of the lady members of the society
and attempted to blackmail him thereby.
"I resent the imputation made by
Kullujian on one of the best and noblest
of women," said Orlow, "and brand his
Ftatement on my honor as an officer in
the Russian and German army as an un
qualified falsehood. â¢ I never employed
Kullujian to shadow anybody. His duties
Fometimes consisted In protecting mem
bers by seeing them safely to the cars
after our meetlngsi" Â«
Judge Van Nostrand in giving judgment

employment had ever ben entered into
between the litigants.

But the spectators were disappointed, for

ing the testimony of the complainant,
which was unsupported and also some
what at variance with the statement
which had enabled him. to procure the
warrant.

thought he heard himâ exclaim: "If you
try to subpena any woman to-night I
will kill you!" Orlow denied having had
a sword when he went from his house on

statement was corroborated' by a Mr.
Everson, who accompanied him to the
street on that occasion. Mr. Everson

THE SAN; FRANCISCO: GALL. THURSDAY, .SEPTEMBER -7, 1905,
MKS. STAKFOED CASE
MATTER OF COMMENT
People of Honolulu, in Dis
cussing Philanthropist's
Death, Criticize Doctor.
Ths latest advices from Honolulu say.
that the Stanford case has not been lost
sight of by the public, and that there Is
still considerable talk as to the cause of
Mrs. Stanford's death.
There is much comment relative to Dr.
.E. C. "Waterhouse, a .young Princeton
graduate, being the only medical man in
Honolulu who. It Is said, would express
an opinion In accordance with the views
held by President Jordan. . Dr. Water
house, it is further alleged, was called
upon by Dr. Jordan and by Detectives
Reynolds and Callundan. He also con
versed with Miss Berner and Miss Hunt,
but he had never seen the body, and had
never spoken to the four attending physi
cians, yet he expressed a medical opinion
that Mrs. Stanford died a natural death.
That was the only basis upon which Dr.
Jordan and Mr. Hopkins Issued their
"theoretical statement" that has ever
since been a matter of wonder In Hono
lulu, according to the story.
When the four doctorsâ Wood, Day,
Humphries and Murrayâ heard of the ac
tion of Dr. Waterhouse, the latter was
called upon and asked If it were true that
he had rendered such an opinion. It is
said that he could not deny the impeach
ment, and when asked tf It was not rather
unprofessional to have done so without
first seeing the attending physicians,: he
became confused, and admitted that he
had not thought of them. He further ad
mitted that he believed that Mrs.. Stan
ford had never had a convulsion and that
this belief was based only what he had
heard and read. - <â¢ .\u25a0
It is further asserted in Honolulu that
for more than three months the repre
sentatives of the Stanford estate in San
Francisco have been In possession vof
ocular proof that Mrs. Stanford did have
a convulsion, a sketch of Mrs. Stanford's
foot showing clearly the arched instep
and other peculiarities consequent upon
death by strychnine having been sent
by Mr. Hopkins In May.
The attitude of the San Francisco â¢ po
lice Is said to have been more or less of
a mystery. Drs. Wood, Day, Humphries
and Murray still maintain that Mrs;
Stanford died of strychnine poisoning.
WIND DOES DAMAGE

Speedy Workmen Make Ke

Departs.
The high wind which, passed over this
city during the latter part of Tuesday
afternoon did considerable damage to the
immense spread of canvas of the Barnum
& Bailey show, necessitating the lower-
Ing of several of the big tops for repairs.
Immediately after the close of last
night's performance, the work of tearing
down and repairing commenced and con
tinued until after daybreak this morning.
The few night hawks who witnessed the
execution of this piece of work were
strongly Impressed by the wonderful sys
tem used and the rapidity with which the
work was performed. ,
While attending the circus last evening
In company with her husband, Mrs. Wil

antics of these little animals. : One of the
simians made a snatch at a diamond
brooch which Mrs. Hamlan wore about
her neck and succeeded â¢In procuring j It.
The brooch Is worth $300. The beast was
attracted by the dazzle of the gems. As

Is Advised to Get : His
Name on the Voting List
The organization committee -of \ the San
Francisco Republican League will hold
another session this evening and con
sider, among other topics, 'the important
subject of registration. VAV A thorough can
vass of several Assembly districts has
been jmade and steps will be taken, to
advise all voters who have not registered
that their civic duty, should be performed
without further delay. â¢
Calculations are made at league head
quarters that: the vote on November 7
will approximate 70,000. At; the municipal
election two years ago the number of
votes cast was slightly in excess of 60,000.
At the Presidential: election of 1904 the
vote exceeded 68,000. .The : large vote of
41,000. cast at the primary election last
month is regarded as ah index of :a< very
large vote on, November 7. "The figures of
increased registration Justify this pre
diction. .Air the signs point to 'a civic up
rising to redeem San Francisco from the
clutch of gTafters. '' ;'"â¢'Â«.\u25a0 \u25a0;â¢ \u25a0â¢"
It Is noted with special gratification
that the leading Republican "papers of the
interior rejoice over, the' success of the
league forces in gaining control of the
municipal convention. The Sacramento
Union speaks of the result in this manner:
In a broader sense the defeat of 'Ruef makes
for good government not only at San Fran
cisco, but throughout the State. The Ruef ele
ment has generally been Identified with graft,
political trickery, corruption of public affairs;
the Republican League, which has accomplished
Ruef's defeat, was called Into being as a pro
test against such corruption and for the promo
tion of . good government. -The effect of : the
league's success and Ruef's defeat will 'not- be
felt at San Francisco alone. In the outcome
the whole State Is necessarily Interested. ' San
Francisco has, for good or bad, powerful influ
ence on the political affairs of the State. At
State conventions). In State Legislatures the me
tropolis has the balance or power, and often
controls nominations and dictates legislation.
It is important for the whole State. that con
trol of the political forces of the city.' be In the
hands of j practical men who stand for honest
administration of public affairs. The effects of
the defeat of Ruef will not be confined to the
coming , municipal election. .but will be felt at
the Republican State Convention next year,
and in the State Legislature of the year fol
lowing. The victory of the Republican League
at San Francisco Is the gain of the whole
State. . .
The Republican delegates who are op
posed to the rule of -Ruef and the sway
of graft will meet In caucus at Pioneer
Hall on the evening of September 12. The
delegates will not seek the advice or
counsel of Ruef in the make-up of the
ticket. The Indications are that capable,
resolute Republicans, in whom the citl-.
Zens have confidence, will be selected to
lead the forces of good government in
the campaign for the betterment of San
Francisco. The nominee agreed upon in
caucus will be nominated in the conven
tion. \u25a0

Training.

Nolan Still Wants
George Siler to
Officiate.
The tangle over the referee for the great
Britt-XCelson light is still unraveled.
Sports hurried along the line last night
asking every one who should know just
what the low-down wis. Really there is
no low-down. The who!* 1 matter seems to
hinge on the arrival of Jim Jeffries from
Los Angeles. The brg fellow will slip into
town to-night and when he has had a talk
â¢with Manager Coffroth and Managers No
lan and.Britt the involved situation may
be unraveled.
Manager Billy Nolan still insists Jeffries
shall not referee the fight. He says there
will b* no fight if the club and Jimmy
Britt Insist upon the big fellow. Ho has
a deep longing In his luart for George
Slier, but as none of the other s.iining
lights in thÂ«Â» present melodramatic mix
up are awaiting to receive Mr. Siler with
extended arms, it seems he will not figure
In thÂ« running.
Manager Jim Coffroth received a wire
last night from Jeffries stating he would
be here this evening and asking if he
had been chosen referee. Coffroth imme
diately wired back informing Jeff he was
the official choice. This seemed to satis
fy the former king of gladiators, for he
burned up no more good money. ' ! - V
.VOI.AJV DLKFUSBS JCFFItIES.
Manager Nolan said last night: "We
will be at the ringside on Saturday ready
to fight, but there must be a conference
about the referee. We will not permit
the Britts to name, the man: we must
have an eaual sharp in the selection^
Nelson is quoted as saying any one will
euit him except Billy Roche. In the pres
ence of witnesses Nelson denied- ever
making such a statement. He will do as
I advise him.
"My ultimatum Is that Jeffries will not
referee the fight. I think the telegram
Willie Britt sent to him shows collusion.
If Jeffries was here five days before the
fight I would have had nothing to say,
as Britt won the toss last Saturday when
we decided upon that me-thod of naming
a man. The club is not a party to the
selection of a referee and cannot name
one.
"We consiaer the betting shows some
thing Is wrong."
The public s<*ems to demand that Jef
fries referee and it seems hardly likely
that Nolan can expect to win his point.
The Britts are positive they will not al
low George Siler to referee.
As Manager Coffroth announces, Jef
fries has been officially chosen as the ref
eree for the fight. There was nothing
said at the time about fees and there is
nothing in the articles of agreement re
garding the compensation of the third
man in the ring. \u25a0.''\u25a0- r r' i
ARUAAGRMBXTS COMPI.RTE.
Meanwhile everything is being rushed
in preparation for the big event. The pa
vilion is about ready and the house is
practically sold out. Coffroth says the
Britts have agreed to be on the grounds
at 1:30 on Saturday afternoon. Jeff will
also be there, so it is up to Nolan to have
the Battling Dane there also.
There is a story going the rounds that
Nolan is trying to bacK out at the last
minute. This seems hardly credible, as
he has gone to the expense of getting
his man Into condition and i.as practi
cally reached the limit." If he should pur
sue such a course as this he would put
the official stamp of disapproval on him
self for all time in the world of sports,
not only here but all over the country.
Nelson was never known to display the
white feather, so It is a foregone conclu
sion he will be on hand to meet Britt
next Saturday afternoon.
The fight- has proved to be one of
the poorest betting propositions for a
contest of its magnitude ever known
In the history of the ring in this city
or anywhere else for that matter. "The
continued squabblings over the choice
of the ' referee seem to have Injured
the wagering and it does not look now
as though It \u25a0would pick. up much be
fore the hour of the battle.
Whatever \u25a0 betting there is being:
done Is In Brltt's favor at odds of 10 to
7. There Is little Nelson money in
sight, although In the past . his back
ers have come out strongly on the last
day. Yesterday should have been a
great flay-^rlth the men who are wont
to wager money on. the outcome of
fights, yet there was no betting to
speak of and the prospects for to-day
are not bright.
XELSOX'S HARD WOR IS OVER.
Bsttllnar Dane Weighs 135 Pounds and
Sars He Is Fit.
With the fight of his life buK three
days off, the Battling Dane figures he
Is about ready, and from now on there
will be no more rough house stunts at
the Colma training quarters. After fin
ishing his allotted task yesterday Nel
son jumped on the scales and balanced
the weights at 135 pounds. That look
ed good to both his manager and him
self and they will now take the other
two pounds off gradually.
Even though the meeting on Saturday
is unsettled Nelson does not let that
condition of affairs interfere with his
preparations. He Insists - the fight is
coming off and is working to get ready
for it. All his thoughts now are direct
ed teward winning.
Nelson went out into ; the open-air
ring yesterday to warm up with Fred
Landers and Bob Xundie, \u25a0 The ' nrst
bout, a two-round affair, was nothing
more than a warmer,' but when Landers
was trotted out things began to be do
ing. While the men swapped wallops
with each other the air was full of fists.
The Dane emerged from the fray at
the end of the second round with his
nose cut up a bit and the perspiration
fairly rushing out of his pores. As the
moments flew by the boxers mixed 'it
livelier until the bout was transformed '
into a 'regular scrap. The big crowd j
around the place* looked' on with eager
Interest while -wallop after wallop was

MANAGER NOLAN, WHOSE ATTITUDE IN THE MATTER |OF SELECTING A

PREP.VRATIONS FOR THE AFFAIH WHICH IS TO BE HELD AT COLMA:

on his face during the progress of the
mill.
When he had finfshed with Landers
Nelson went into the gym and did a few
light stunts. He fooled around only a
few minutes before taking his rubdown.
Manager Xolan says the rough work
is over. It will be limbering-up acts
from now on with the . champion of
Hegewisch. The last two pounds of
weight are expected to come off with
out difficulty. The Dane; says he is fit
and as long as he feels that way, he
says, there is no use in his 'working his
head off any longer.

amateur didn't think so, much of it. i. ,
In the morning Britt. did his custom

Then came more rope skipping. Pulling

ZILLMAX IS CKOWNED
THE SCIIUETZEX KING
Wins High .-Honors in An
nual Competition of San
Francisco' Verein. -
Dr. A.L. W. Zillmah is king. of .the San
Francisco Schuetzeh Verein. With steady
aim he brought down the last remnant of
the eaele yesterday at Shell j Mound Park,
which won for him the honor of king in
the oldest shooting company of the State.
The doctor is-a Native. Son and will go to
Sacramento .on the 9th, full of victory.
The King shoot of the verein is one of
the principal events of the year among
marksmen, as it determines who is to be
the ruling spirit of the club, both in a
social manner, and also to encourage his
fellow marksmen to better efforts during
the comlng^ear.
The company left the armory at Sara
toga Hall promptly at 8 o'clock, under
command ot Captain Henry Stelllng and
Lieutenants Da via Salfield, Henry Meyer
Louis Barner and L.C. Hoffmann, to cel
ebrate the forty-seventh annual king
shoot. *
A wooden eagle perched upon a pole,
about seventy-five yards distant, was the
object of the marksmen's fire. The head,
wing, leg, daw and other parts of 'the
bird are so constructed that it is neces
sary for the bullet to strike a small peg
in order to detach it from the bird; Sepa
rate prizes are offered for each piece a
lucKy shooter brings to "the ground. After
all the parts of the eagle are shot away,
except, the center of the 'body, which is
protected by tan iron plate, . the _ pole ;is
lowered; the iron plate removed and all is
ready, for the king shooting.
j When the -well-directed . shot of x Dr. ' A^
L..V W. Zillman ' proclaimed him king \of
the schuetjehs he was placed; in a chair
and' carried through the ; park by stand-;
ard-bearersâ John " Lankenau, Edward
Stehn, J. : J.; Baehr and . George â¢* Selden:
Upon arrival at the pavilion he, was intro
duced by President â¢J. ; D. " Helse , and \ in

SCROFULA
FROM PARENT TO CHILD
The laws ' of \ heredity'are ? fcrrariable
and ' the . diseased blood of parents is
handed down to children in the form of
Scrofula; Being thus deeply rooted
nothing can reach the disease bnt a con-
stitutional remedy. The very foundation
of the blood is diseased, and until it is
purified and made strong, those who are
born ; with a scrofulous tendency cannot
have the blessing of robust health.;

. The Pacitic Mail Company's steam
ship Ciiiua, Captain Friele, sailed yes
terday for the Orient with a lull cargo
and a larg-e number of passengers.
Alexander Center, who is in charge of
Pacific Mail affairs during the absence
<>i' R.. P. Schvrerin, dispatched the liner
almost on time. Passengers, baggage,
rr.fa.il. even the office mail, were on board
at 1 o'clock and only the unfortunate
bursting of & steam pipe prevented the
China leaving with the punctuality of
an army transport. The damaged pipe
was replaced by a sound one and the
liner got away without any serious
delay.
The China's passengers included tour
ists, business men, Government officials
and insular employes and many mis
sionaries. She carried a large consign
ment of cattle on the forward deck.
Among the passengers were:

l/oirs Still KndanÃer Shipping:.
The lops which got adrift" last -week from the
Hammond Lumber Company's raft are still
menacing navigation. The crab season being
over, the nshermen who own power propelled
boats are devottng their time to gathering up
these dangerous derelicts and restoring tS*em
to th* owners of the raft. On B*y Firm
Island one rancher has quite a collection of
the logs and is figuring on how he can most
profitably utilise the lumber laid at bis door
by the tide. The Hammond Lumber Company
claims all lops found inside the bay sjid this
notwithstanding the faxt" that most of those
still floating about have made several trips
outride t)ie fceads on as many ebb- tides. - Om
dollar is said to t>e the reward mid to the.
flndeT of a stray leg and prosecution for lar
ceny is the penalty of making other disposi
tion of the salvage than returning It to the
company. This attitude of the lumber com
pany may prove expensive, as these wander
ing logs have caused more than a little dam
age, for which, it is eaid an attempt will be
made to hold th? Hammond Lumber Company
responsible. One man sustained a fractured
l*-(r a* the result of an encounter In the surf
with one of the runaway logs. To be logical
in its claim of ownership. &ay shipplnr peo
ple, th? Hammond Lumber Company should
put lights on every runaway iog In order that
ih* floating property of others should not be in
danger at night of colliding with one of the
lunitx-r company's wandering assets.

Chase Js the most important witness

AJurdock and Hunt to Meet
Sinsabaiigh and Braly for
Tennis Doubles Honors
FAST PLAY IS SEEN
Janes and Adams Do Some
. Sensational Work in Match
Witli â¢ the " Southerners
Some fast : tennis was played yes
terday on the Hotel Rafael courts. The
men's doubles tournament for the coast
championship was completed to the
finals, as were the women's singles and
doubles: events. ".As a result of the
day's" play. Percy. Murdock'-'ahd Reuben
'Hunt of Alameda will meet Simpson
Sinsabaugh and Harold Braly to-mor
row afternoon for the championship;
Miss Violet Sutton and Mrs. Bruce will
play Miss Ida Mearns and Miss Vera
Crocker Saturday morning for the dou
bles championship, and the Misses Vio
let and Florence Sutton will meet Fri
day afternoon to determine who shall
challenge Miss May Sutton, the coast
champion, on~. Saturday morning. . .
By far the most interesting -match
yesterday occurred In the 1 semi-finals
of the men's, doubles, when Percy
Murdock and Reuben Hunt met Fred
Adams and George A. Janes. It was the
fastest tennis seen on the San Rafael
courts this. year. - Janes and Adams
started like. worldbeaters and after be
ing led 4-2, won the next four games
and set handily. -They killed from all
parts of the court. and were playing
an almost invincible game, -u'ey took
three out, of the first four games in
the', second set and looked to have the
match well in hand:
At this stage of the game Hunt and
Murdock changed their, style of play.
They ceased lobbing and resorted .to
driving and smashing,' Murdock played
the best tennis he has put up since he
met Bell two years ago. Hunt also
showed great improvement and played
up to his Eastern form. When once
fairly started Hunt and .Murdock
pulled out the "second" and- third sets
with little difficulty. The losers lost
their steam toward the end \u25a0of .'the
match and were not as effective- as at
the start.
.-.The other "semi-final match was. a
great contrast to the one won by Hunt
and Murdock. The contestants-, were
Braly and Sinsabaugh and R. N\ Whit
ney and Charles Foley. All four play
ers lobbed constantly, neither side
seeming to care to take- a chance.
Whitney and Foley won the first set
and almost to the end of the second set
looked sure winners. They, were with
in a. point of the match at 7-6 and 40
30, but Whitney drove out of bounds.
Braly and Sinsabaugh led for the
first time in the match at 8-7. but
Whitney and Foley won the 'next two
games. ' Braly and Sinsabaugh did some
good smashing at the end of the set
and pulled it out 11-9.
Whitney and .Foley were "all in
after the second set and their oppo
nents beat thctn without the loss of a
game. .
One match was played in women's
singles and one, in. doubles. In the
former Miss Florence Sutton disposed
of Miss Ethel Ratclirfe easily. The lat
ter was expected to make a good
showing, but was outclassed by Miss
Sutton.' : â¢ - : '\u25a0\u25a0; â¢\u25a0 :\u25a0\u25a0 --.:'* \u25a0:.:\u25a0 \u25a0 ' :

T):e New York circular of Henry Nordiinger
& Co. says of CofTee:
"Inland distributors who allowed their stocks
to run down to a minimum in the hope of be
ing abie to replenish same to advantage out of
the new crop saw their- plans miscarried and
were finally compelled to enter the market as
buyers; this created a healthy trade demand
throughout ihe month, wfctcn in tarn helped to
bring about a further advance la prices. The
firmness of vajues is, however, more directly
applicable to the stradiness of primary markets
in the fÂ£ce of an advance or about 6 per cent
In the Brazilian rate of exchange,' making the
linport coet correspondingly higher.
"Coroparisor-s are frequently made of late
between the smaller receipts at Rio and San
tos so far during this crop year, snd those of
the previous two years, rue receipts this year
tre &bc>ut 15 per cent smaller than last year,
er.i about 30 per ceot smaller than two yean
ago. Then we had crops of 10,000,000 and
10,400.000 bags respectively. We do not con
aider U cafe to estimate the sice of the crop
on the basis of the receipts t>f the first two
rr.or.the of this year, because particular influ
ences were at work laÂ«t year and the year be
fore which brought the Coffee forward from
the plantations In large volume early 'in the
season, ard we Z&ll to ccc similar conditions
existing Mils year. To tne contrary, we be
lieve that this year the low xallrels price ruling
In Brazil ' is retarding- the movement to some
extent. For this reason we do not expect to
ccc fuch an important reduction in the crop
ss the falling . en* In the receipts would Indi
cate, nor do we think that the crop will be
anything like as large as has been previously
eeti treated.
THE 1906-19C7 CROP.
"Talcing into consideration the improved
financial condition of the planters, due to the
fc'-Â«hex price realised last year for their prod
uct, as a feature bearing en the movement of
thj. crop, and riving due weight to the poor
*<fZ~ -irn of the yield at to Quantity and Quality,
w_ taking cognizan*ce of the entire absence
* <oi old accumulations on the plantations (for the
rirEt time in years), we arrive at the conclu
sion that the receipts st Rio and Santos during
the prttent crcp year will be In the neighbor
hood of 10.000.000 bags. ' '
'"With regard to the 1908-7 crop, fears were
entertained until recently by the trade that the
continuous rainfall lasting from last Novem
tÂ«r to April, would prove to be extremely
beneficial to the trees, end that a very Urge
crop would follow the current one. This fear
we believe has been sufficiently dissipated by
severe frosts experienced of late In some lm
pomnt districts la the State icf Sao Paulo,
ss that a large Eantos crop for 1906-7 cannot
t* counted on any more. The flowering during
September and October will naturally be
\u25a0R-atched very carefully, ana especially the eel
ting of thÂ» fruit. If the aowering should be
vniavorable, a small crop would be the natural
result, bat even tf the flowering should turn
out to be good, many eventualities may occur
between the flowering and the maturing period
to . urn..! the crop; we have telling examples .
in tliis respect in "he crops of the previous
three y?ars. yrtttctt Â«tartetf Jn iiflta-s prolific
flowering ar:3 -showed poor results In the end.
"It teems to us that the trade may properly
adjust its Ideas to the new order of things;
1. c.. that large crops of Rio end Santos are
cut cf the question for some years to come,
and that we will have s continuation of emalier
jirofiuction than the world requires for con
\ sumption."
The Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdle, section
director cf the climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
Warm and clear weather prevailed during
the week, with high toes in thÂ« central ac 4
northern coma districts. Abnormally high tem
peratures occurred in Southern Caiilornla en
the Â«-ti. er.a _Jth, the maximum reaching 100
o^srees in L,.* Angeies and portions 01 San
XJiego County. ForÂ«Â«t and brush ares caused
Â«\u25ba .-_ .--.-rjiL.-.- - arr.fi ge in s&cta Crux and Los
. .Â»â¢Â» counties.
Y^^-I* Picking is progressing rapidly in i all
Â«Â«uonÂ»; i.-.tr yield appears to be very uneven,
unÂ« c:str.Lis haviiig a quits heavy crop and
others exceedingly light, tout on the whole it is
probabl* tne crop will be about average - and
o: good quaiity. Bean harvest has commenced
in many p.acts. and will soon become general;
prospecu are good for a heavy crop in the
vicinity of &aa Luis Oblspo and a fair crop in
the bas.t& Maria district. Bean canning ha*
commenced ia Lake County, sugar beet har
vest continues; the yield is remarkably heavy
In Santa. Barbers County and below average
in Aifirrwria County. Urain. tareshi&g arid ha>
balir.g are not yet completed, but most of tne
crop has been secured. Grain Is below average
fend hay the best crop lor several years.
Many reports Indicate a light crop of grapes,
and it Is probable that early estimates were
incorrect. Kaisin, wine and table grapes ar*
being harvested and are generally of superior
quality. Fruit drying continues. The decidu
ous Xruit crop is Xair, but cot as good as ex
pected. â¢ A W>les will yield heavily la Hum
boldt sod baata Cruz counties. Orange trees
were benested by the hot weather, and the out
look is good for a reoox-d-breakinff crop. Wai
cuts, almonds and olives are doing weli, but
It 1Â» probable the heat injured walnuts slightly.
Sacramento. . Valiey â CSear weather con
tinued during the week, and the temperature
waÂ« nearly normal. - Grape p:cking and ship
ping prctrressed rapidly, and the weather was
favorable for fruit drying. The grape crop In
Â£Â«.cramento County is much below the average,
but the grapes axe -of good quality. White
Adriatic tigs are being gathered and the qual
ity of the fruit Is rood. Oranges and olive*
tt Palermo are developing satisfactorily and
give promise tÂ»f gx>od crops. Salway peaches
are being harvested. The almond crop will be
large. Hep .picking continues. Beans are flll
lr.g wejl and the outlook is good for a large
crop. Hay baling is nearly completed, and
the graJn an a hay crops are mostly secured.
t Coast . and ' Bay Sections â Clesr and warn :
\u25a0â¢ather continued in the Interior, and . foggy
ihts and rsorclr-gs in the coast districts. Tht
legs have caused slight mildew on grapes in
Sonoma. County, sod some injury to hops.
Grs-pe picking Is progressing rapidly; the
grapes axe of good quality, but the yield will ;
cot be ac large as expected, and In some cec
tioss it will be r nl>- -about two-thirds \u25a0 of the
average. The prune crop will be lighter than
expected, but the fruit is of superior quality.
t:.c:.- is a U.rse cfcp of dllng peaches in "San
Bcnito County. The prospect is good' for a
bcavy crcp of apples In Uumboldt and Santa
Cru* counties. Ciovertlale oranges are of go^d
size and a large crop U probable. Hop picking
Is in rrotrress; at Picasanton the crop is re
jported Ispht, but in Sonoioa County there will
be a larce yield. The toeet crop in'Uvermore
Valley :s bel&Â«r av*raÂ«;e. Bean canning is In
procreE* In Lal:e County. There will be a
heavy crop c? beats in the vicinity of San
Luis Obisira.- - â¢ -
San Jcaqtiin Valley â Clear, warm weather
prevailed during" the paÂ»t rwk. These condi
tions were favorable for the maturing and
fcarvesi'as of al! crops. The peach crop is
mostly of and averaged from fair to
rood. Alhtoria han-ect is progressing, sxd the
quantity srjd qtuility are both good. Prune
drying is progressing; the crop is light, but
the quality ts gxA. Ols%'es have set well and
promise a good crop. The grape harvest is
rer.erai, and satisfactory progress Is being \
made. Wtncriee are running, and are working '

Km York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. Â«.â The fall In prices of
stocks was resumed to-day and gained mo
mentum with progrees. The hardening of the
money market was the basic cause of the de
cline. There was no refusal of meney facili
ties on the part of the loaders and no actual
necessity therefore for the closing out of. hold
ings of stocks. There is a very general senti
ment that a severe stringency In money iÂ« not
what Is to be feared. But no doubt is left
that money rates are worKing clear and will
continue to do so. It is deemed extremely
improbable that prices of stocks should con
tinue to advance while money rates are rising.
With the prices of stocks admittedly high,
holders are loth to see values drop from under
their holdings, however great their confidence
may be in the intrinsic worth of their properties.
This furnishes the substantial reason for the
sagging tendency of the market.' There are, of
cource, the more transitory causes which apply
to lightly margined speculative holdings and
which appeal to the motive of the alert trading
element, which seeks Its advantage in the im
mediate movement of prices rather than from
any Innate value in the stocks which they deal
In. It was recognizable that the requirements
of the outstanding short interest were much
less urgent to-day than on yesterday, -when
their buying furnished the uplifting Influences
to prices. After ' the straggling mixture of
gains and losses on the opening quotations \u25a0 the
course of prices turned downward. The occa
sional support of Reading was of only slight
influence in checking the downward tendency 1 .
On the side of the foreign exchange the pros
pect for "relief was clouded by reports of a
substantial early, advance .in the minimum dis
count rates cf the Bank of England and- .the
Imperial Bank of-Gerroany, ..although exchange,
rates fell under offering of \u25a0 -bankers'- bills to
day. . Paris also continues to accumulate gold.
It. Is concluded that the -svoidarjee-of an in
demnity payment by Russia dees not preclude
the Intention of. Coa-Usg a- targe Ruscian loan,
for which European centers are . preparing.
While no Japanese issue is expected immedi
ately, it is known that the Japanese funde in
New York are being remitted to* London. The
renewed threatening outgivings on stock mar
ket, affairs of the Boston operator also got on
the nerves of Wall street, owing to their time
liness with the reduction "in the price of Cop
per announced in New York and the "sharp drop
in that commodity in the London market. The
selling 'was the heaviest in the last hour of
the day. when call money reached 3 per cent
and thÂ« final prices were far the lowest. The
undertone at the last was weak. :
Bonds were heavy. - Total sales, par value,

CHICAGO. Sept. '6.â The wheat \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 market
opened, firm, initial quotations on December
being unchanged to %c higher, at Â«l%Â©si'vc.
The flrmnesa . was apparently due to heavy
rains throughout Kansas, \u25a0 which led to \ good
buying by commission . houses and pit traders
during the first hour. In consequence \ the
market gained slightly 'in strength, December
touching 81% c. The small upturn did not hold
and a reaction ensued, December declining to
81Ji@81%c. . Renewed demand, however, from
the leader t>f the bulls was followed by a'com
plete recovery. .The marktt was strengthened
by shorts who bought on weather bureau pre
dltcions-of general rains to-night in Minne*
sota and the Dakotas. / Another factor Chat
.contributed to | the strength . late lln the day
was an advance of lc a bushel In the price of
caÂ£h wheat about - thÂ« close. . Private reports
from the; Northwest telling of small, yield and
poor quality of new wheat, helped to create
bullish sentiment. For December the highest
pclnt : of *- the day . was - reached at 82V6c.- The
market closed strong, ,wlth December up %c

There Is no .particular change In anything.

The circular of Somers & Co. .says of Hay:
'.'Shipments: of Hay during the week -Just
ended have been running very hea.yy, the total
showing 5100 tons, an . Increase of 200 tons
over the week : preceding. With no market
yesterday there is . naturally quite an accu
mulation of Hay to-day, arrivals this morning
being ISOO tons. As was noted last week, an
unusually large portion of total arrivals is by
water and quite a portion of these is Alfalfa.
As long as the rain holds off Alfalfa will con
tinue ;to grow 1 and be cured for market. ;
.-"Borne districts . are : being well cleaned â¢ up,
while 'In other : sections . there lg still quite a
lot of I Hay to be baled. Stotckton reports
about 1500 tons yet* In stacks and cocks; Nupa
and . Sonoma counties have still a large quan

llster districts show rapid progress toward the
entire -cleaning; of . their -. fields. .. - * ,"
\u25a0i "Town trade is beginning to - show some
weakness, which Is not to be wondered at. con
sidering the vast amount of Hay that has bein
forced upon the market and distributed around
to the various. consumers. "â¢ Â«
"To sum -up the situation, .we can only say
that the sole feature of the market is Its dull
ness, and we can > anticipate no activity In
the situation .until after the rains set In." ,

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits. -- . \u0084
Trade in fresh fruits was of rgood volume,
but. with supplies of most descrlpUons - bur
densome, the market was jenerally weak and,'
low prices ruled ' for | almost everj'tnlng. Therw
were large lines of poor Peaches on the market
to the detriment of good "â¢ stock, and prices
had a wide range. - Three t 'Â«ulo&d v two from. \u25a0

came in on the preceding day.;- jk,Â«S^l. turned'
down by ;the consignees, having, arrived -in
bad order. This stock was being pressed for
sale at> very -low rates. All kinds -of- table"
Grapes were weak under continued heavy ar-'
rivals and, although trade was active at the
revised quotations, there was a heavy surplus
at the close. .Wine Grapes arrived freely.- but
remained steady.- Fancy Apples and* fine Bart
lett Pears continued firm and occasional', sales
of - the .latter, were reported 'at \ a,-, premium.
Plums, .Prunes and Quince* - were ' easy and
Figs were lower under Increased receipts. AH
kinds of Berries were slow of eale, the^puNlc
having evidently tired of them, ' Mexican Umes
were more- plentiful â¢ and lower. Otherwise

SAYS FKUIT LABEL
LAW IS NOT VALID
Supreme Court Thinks Con
tested Pleasure Is Invasion
of Personal Eights.
The Supreme Court has declared un
constitutional the law which provided
that all bores and packages of shipped
f ru+f must bear in inch-high letters
the name of the county and immediate
locality where the contents were grown.
The provision was ostensibly aimed
at stopping the shipment of bad pro
duce from lacilities famous for excel
lent products, but was really in the
interest of certain sections that have
won good reputations without neces
sarily having surpassed other parts of
the State in producing fine fruit.
The court holds that the law is un
reasonable and in rendering its deci
fi â¢ against the State says:
It has come to be well recognized that the
liberty and pursuit of happiness In which the
Individual ie protected by the constitution of
thÂ« United States and of the State applies fully
to hie right of contract, his right to follow a le
gitimate vocation, untrammeled by unneces
sary regulations, as It does to the freedom of
arrest or restraint of his person.

SEEKS REPORT
ON RIVER WORK
Association Addresses the
Federal Engineers About
Navigation and Drainage
A communication has been addressed
by the River.. and Drainage Association
of California to the Commission of
Federal Engineers, asking the commis
sion to specify the work that ought to
be done to develop the navigation of
the Sacramento River and its flood
carrying capacity as a matter separate
and distinct frqjn land reclamation, so
that steps may be taken to have the
work performed jointly by the Federal
and State Governments. The communi
cation is in full as follows:
The River Improvement and Drainagre Asso
ciation of California respectfully 'submits:
That there are about 1,2(0,000 acres of land
in the valley of the Sacramento River and its
tributaries, of insignificant value at the pres
ent time, that with certain improvements in
the flood carrying capacity of the rivers might
be made hishly productive.
That the work neceesary .to effect this im
provement Is of too great a magnitude for
the owners of the lands themselves to under
take; neither should such work be expected
of them. It Is estimated that already fully
$25,000,000 have been spent by individuals in
unsuccessful efforts to prevent the overflow
of their lands, and the conclusion is forced
upon the community that the provision of
necessary channels to .carry the flood water
ia the only correct course to make possible the
protection of these lands from overflow.
That the State of California Is anxious to
promote the redemption of this body of land
and to contribute her share of the cost of
the -work, but realizes there are; other Inter
ests involved, and desires to have determined
the sources from which the funds ahould.be
derived and a just apportionment of the burden
made. . .
That the large and important Sacramento
Valley woul. be largely benefited by the Im
provement of the navigation of the -river and
its tributaries.
That che flood carrying capacity of the Sac
-ramento ft vex has largely deteriorated.-.
â¢That the Federal Government, reserving ex
clusive jurisdiction over the navigable rivers,
by Bufferlug and permitting some of the causes
of deterioration, has assumed a responsibility
in the rrcmiees.
That thÂ«. assistance of the State and Federal
government* should be given only to the ex
ter.Wof making it possible for the land owners
to reclaim the lands.
That It Is the earnest hope of this associa
tion that your honorable commission may
epecify the work that should ' be done to de
velop the navigation of the river and its flood
carrying capacity as a matter separate and
distinct from the reclamation of the land, to
the end that our representatives may take
steps to get this work undertaken jointly
by the Federal and State governments. Re
spectfully,
The River Improvement and Drainage Asso
ciation of California â Rufus P. Jennings,
president; Edw. P. Antron, secretary.
COST OF SPRING VALLEY
DESCRIBED BY REYNOLDS
Says That Les-al Expenses and Office
Salaries Are Included in
Estimates.
George W. Reynolds, accountant, in
his \u25a0 cross-examination In the Spring
Valley case yesterday by Assistant City
Attorney John S. Partridge, testified that
such things -as interest on borrowed
money during the course* of' construc
tion, engineers' salaries, a portion of
the legal expenses : and office salaries
were really a part of the cost, of con
structing: new works ; and \ should ' be
added to the investment. He added that
these sums were paid out of the water
rates. . ; , . \u25a0.
\u25a0 Mr.Partrldg-e asked: "If these sums
.become a part 'of the Investment, and
are paid out of the income from water
sales, are they, not a profit 7"
"Tea," replied Mr. Reynolds.
"Then the: profit-In any one year
would be the sum of the dividends, plus
the sums derived from water sales and
Invested in the works 7"
"Yes."
"And that would- be true during the
years Involved in this suit, namely 1903,
1904, and 1906?" .-'y?- ";;
"Yes."
Mr. Reynols also testified that in his
opinion the following sudib which had
| been charged on the books to operating
expenses should be charged to new con
struction: General expense,' $1,396,
408 84; office expense, $227,000; salary
expense, $1,918,947 21; legal expense,
$269,558 71; engineering. expense, $208,-
I 180 22; and, in addition, a large amount
i of interest, which he had not yet -com-*
| puted.

SPRINTS AND GULPS BEER AT THE RATE
OF ONE QUART FOR EACH BLOCK.
While running the distance extending
along three and one-half city '" block's * of
regulation length Fred , Sheridan S con
sumed three and one-half quarts; of beer
from four bottles which he had. purloined
from John Kroger's delivery, wagon. That
his gait was not slow may be inferred
from the fact that Mr. Kroger, and'sev
eral others were pursuing him.
"It was a remarkable feat," said Folioe
Judge Conlan, gazing semi-admiringly at
Mr. Sheridan, who was accused of petty
larceny, . "and if there isan R. X.' Fox
medal for the beer-gulping championship
of the world you are entitled to -wear the
trophy." ' ' . " . :. , '
Mr. Sheridan, whose ensemble was un
prepossessing, modestly \u25a0 Informed â¢ the
court. that on more than one 'occasion he
had eclipsed the performance for. ; which
he was arrested. "If I'd a-bln goln'- fer a
record," he added, "I'd a-hed .them, four
bottles copped 'n'^not a drop wasted afore
I'd a-gone three blocks." '-.
"That statement wrenches my credu
lity," quoth his Honor, "but. in the ab
sence of proof to, the contrary I fain must
swallow itâ as you did the three and one
half quarts. May we ,as to j your
means of living?"
"I'm a hotel man," was the answer.
"You don't look it; but after what you
did with the three and one-half quarts it's
not for me to doubt your word concern
ing anything. And,' pray, where is your
hotel?" : :.'{, '
"On Mission street." -
"Are. you Its sole owner?" " . -
"No; I'm its sole dishwasher."
It was at Golden Gate avenue and Lar
kin street that Mr.' Sheridan pilfered the
beer, and several | witnesses testified j that
his sprinting would have been creditable
even if unaccompanied by the guzzling
performance. He will be sentenced this
morning. - â¢ >'". ; '
