The Sunday Call MagazineThere was' a strange a"rid ominous .
murmur of voices, a shuffttng of feet
in the gallery, a. silence which was Ilka
the silence before a storm. Anna, who
had sung the first verse of her sons,
looked around the house, a, little .sur
pfised at the absence of the applause '
which had never yet failed her. She
realized in a moment what had hap
pt-ned. Even though the individual â¢
faces of her audlenoe were not to be
singled out. she hud been conscious
from the first moment ot. her appear
ance that something was wrong. She
hesitated, and for a moment thought
of omitting the second verse alto
gether. The manager, however, wHo.
stood in the wings, nodded to her to
proceed, and the orchestra commenced
the first few bars of the music Then
the storm broke. A. Ions shrill catcall
in the gallery seemed to be the algrnal.
Then a roar of hisses. They came
from every part, from the pit. the
circle and the gallery, even from the
stalls. And there arose, 1 too, a back

seemed to him that a sort of mist had
risen up between them. Everything
was blurred. Only her face was clear,
frail and delicate, almost flower-like,
with the â¢ sad, haunting eyes ever
watching his. Annabel a murderess!
It was not possible. .
"Child!" he cried. . "You do "not
know what you say. This Is part of a
dreamâ some evil fancy. Think! You
could riot have done it"
She shook her head deliberately,
hopelessly. ' . .
. "I think that I know very well what
I am saying," she answered. "I went
to Anna's rooms because I felt I
must see , her. . He was there
concealed, waiting for her return. He
recognized me at once and he behaved
like a madman. He swore that I was
his wife, that chance had given me to
him at last John, he was between me
and the door. â¢ A strong, coarse man,
and there were things In his eyes which
made my blood run .cold with terror.
He came over to me. I was helpless.
Beside me on Anna's table .was a pis
tol. I was not even sure whether' it
was loaded. I snatched It up, % pointed
it blindly at him and fired."
"Ah!" Sir John exclaimed.
. "He fell over at my feet" : shÂ« .con
tinued. "I saw him stagger and sink
down and the pistol was still smoking
in my,hand. I bent over him. Anna
had told me that he tarried always
with him "this bogus . marriage certifi
cate. I undid his 'coat and I took It
from his pocket. I burned it"/
' "But the marriage .itself?" "Sir John
asked. "I do not understand."
"There was no marriage," she an
swered. ."I was very' foolish to have
been .deceived even for a moment
.There "was ' no . marriage "and I hated,
oh,' how I hated the man."
"Did any one see you leave the .fiat ?"
he asked. ..
"I do not know. But David Courtlaw
has. been here. To-night they say. he
will be conscious. He will say who it
was. So there is no escape. And lis

to be frightened about in the least
Remember that" â¢
She kissed him passionately and ran
lightly upstairs. In the hall below she
could Tiear his firm voice giving quick
commands to the servants.
"When you married me "
â¢ Her little hand flashed out across
the. table. . * \ - .
"Johni" she said. "I can spare you
that question. I -had been about as
foolish and selfish as a girl could be.
I had done the most compromising
things and behaved in the most ridic
ulous way. But from the restâ you
saved me." h Â¦ - . .
Sir John breathed a long, deep sigh.
He eat up in his chair again, the color
came back to his cheeks.
"John, don't!" she cried. "You
think that this is all. You are going
to be generous arid forgive. It isn't
all: There is worse to' come. Â¦ There
Is a tragedy to come."
"Out with It then," he cried, al
most roughly. "Don't you know,
child, that* this is torture for me?
What in God's name more can you
have to tell me?"
Her face had" become almost like a
'marble image., She spoke. with a cer
tain odd deliberation carefully, chosen
words which fell like drops of ice
upon the man who sat listening.
"Before I " met you I was deluded
into receiving upon friendly terms a
man ..named. Hill, -.who passed" himself
off as Meysey Hill, the railway; man.
but. who ..was in reality an Englishman
In poor circumstances. . He was going
to settle I fbrgqt how many millions
upon me, and I think that I was daz
zled. I went with him to what I sup
posed I to be . the British embassy and
went through a ceremony which I un
derstood-to, be the usual form of the
marriage bhe used there. Afterward
we .started for^ a motor ride to a place
outside Paris for dejeuner, and I sup
pose the man's nerve failed' him. I
questioned him too , closely about his
possessions and remarked upon the
fact that he was a most inexpert driv
er, although. Meysey- Hill had a great
reputation as a motorist Anyhow he
confessed that he was a fraud. I
struck , him r across the face, jumped
out' and went back 'by train to Paris.
He lost control - of the machine, was-

Anna. Do you understand?"
"I do. not," he answerer "How
could I. when your sister sings now at
the 'Universal' every night, and .the
name Alcide flaunts from- every pla
card in London?" -\ ">
v The likeness between us," she said,
"before I began to disfigure myself
with rouge and.ill-dressed hair was re
markable. Anna failed in her paint
ing, our money was gone and/she was
forced to earn her own living.' She
came to London and tried several
things without any success."
/'But whyâ" , , "
Sir John stopped short With a mo
ment of inward shame he remembered
his deportment toward Anna. It was
scarcely likely that she would have ac
cepted his aid. Some one had once, in
his hearing, called him a prig. He re
membered it suddenly. He thought of
his severe attitude toward the girl who
was rightly and with contempt refus
ing his measured help. , He looked
across at Annabel, and he groaned.
This was his humiliation as well as
hers. â¢
"Anna, of course, , would not accept
any money from- us," she continued.
"She tried everything, and last of all
she tried the stage. . She went to a
dramatic agent and he turned out to be
the one who ..had heard me sing In
Paris. He refused to believe that Anna
was not Alcide. He thought she
wished to conceal her identity because
of the connection with you, and he of
fered her an engagement at once. She
was , never announced as Alcide, but
directly she walked on she simply be
came Alcide to every one. She had a
better voice. than I and the rest I sup
pose Is only a. trick. The real Alcide,"
she wound up with a faint smile across
the table at him, "is here."
He sat like a man turned to stone.
Some part of the. stiff vigor of the man
seemed to have subsided. He seemed to
have shrunken In his seat His eyes
were fixed upon her face, but he
opened his lips twice before he spoke.
.Â¦will . be some one else. . I should like to
have, had you forgive me."
He did not move. He seemed to be
thinking hard, She paused for a mo
. ment. Then she raised the glass near
er to.her lips.
. "Good-by, John," she said simply.
Something, in her tone made him look
up. In a second the glass lay shattered
upon the carpet. There was a stain
of wine upon her dress. . â¢
"God in heaven, Annabel!" he cried.
"What were you doing?"
Her voice was a little hysterical. Her,
unnatural calm was giving way.
"It was poisonâ why not?" she an-
BTÂ»ered. "Who Is there to care andâ
John." / -\ ri :
- - His arms were around her. He
kissed her once on the lips with a pas
sion of which, during all their days of
married life, he had given no sign.
"You poor little girl!" he cried. "For
give you, indeed. There Isn't a hus
band breathing, Annabel, who wouldn't
have blessed that pistol in your hands
and pray<:d God that the bullet might
go straight. It is no crime, none at
all. It is one of God's laws that a
woman may defend her honor, even
with . the shedding of blood. While
you talked I was only making our
plans. It was necessary to think, and
think quickly." Â¦Â¦-,'Â¦*.
She was altogether hysterical now.
"But Iâ I went to Nigel Ennlson for
help. I asked himâ to take me away."
She saw him flinch, but he gave no
sign of it in his tone.
."Perhaps," he said, "I have been to
blame. It must be my fault that you
have not learned that your, husband
is the man to come toâ at such a time
as this. Oh, I think I understand.
Annabel. You were afraid of me, afraid
that I should have been shocked,, afraid
of the scandal. Bah. Little woman,
you have been brave enough before.
Full yourself together now. Drink
this!" Â¦â¢ Â¦:,â¢;:;Â¦â¢. .
He -poured out a glass of wine with
a firm hand and held it to her lips.
She drank it obediently.'
"I have. been very selfish," she de
clared. "But- you must forgive me,
...
. . "I would forgive yt>u a great deal
more,", he .answered readily, "for the
sake of an evening like this. You have
actually given up a dinner-party to
â¢dine alone with me."
"And made you give up a" political
meeting." she reminded .him. '.r."
"Quite an unimportant one," he as
surea. her. "I would have given up
anything to see you your old self again
â ' as you are this evening."
."I am afraid I have not been very
nice," she said sadly. "Never mind.
You must. think of this evening, John,
sometimes â as a sort of atonement."
They were lingering over their des
sert. â¢ The servants had left the room.
Annabel half filled her glass with wine,
and taking a little folded packet from
her plate, shook the. contents into it.
'â¢ "I am developing ailments," she said,
meeting his questioning eyes. "It is
nothing of Â¦ any importance. John, I
have something to say to you."
"If yo.u want to .ask. a favor," he re
marked smiling, "you have made it
almost impossible for me to refuse you
anything."
"I am going to ask more than a
favor,-" she said* slowly. "I am going to
ask your forgiveness."
Jle. was a little uneasy. . "
. "I "do not know what you mean." he
said, "but if you are referring to any
little coolness since our marriage let
us never speak of it again. I am some
thing of an old fogy, Anna, I'm
afraid; but if you treat me like this
you will teach me to forget it." Â¦
Annabel looked intently into : her
glass.
"John," she said, "I'm afraid that I
am going to make you unhappy. I am
very, very sorry, but you must listen
to me." â¢ /'A.
He relapsed into a stony silence. A
few feet away, across the low vases of
pink and white roses, sat Annabel,
more beautiful to-night perhaps than
'ever before in her life. She wore a
wonderful dress of turquoise blue,
made by a great dressmaker for a
function which she knew very well
now that she would. never attend. Her
hair once more was arranged with its
old simplicity. There was a new soft
ness in her eyes., a hesitation, a timid
ity about her manner which was al
most pathetic.
. "You remember our first meeting?"
"Yes," he answered, hoarsely. "I re
member it very well indeed. You have
the look In your eyes to-night which
you had that day, the look of a fright
ened child." "
She looked into her glass.
"I was frightened then," she de
clared. "I am frightened now. But it
is all very different. There was hope
for me then. Now there is none. No,
none at all."
"You talk strangely, Anna," he said.
"Go on!"
"People talked to you in Paris about
us," Bhe continued; "about Anna the
virtuous and Annabel the rake. You
were accused of having been Been with
the latter. You denied it, remembering
that I had called myself Anna.' You

tell you the truth, it has seemed just
lately as though we were becoming in

have not shuwn much desire for iny
iuciety, have you?"
; "You have been wrapped up in your
politics," she murmured.
He shook his head.
"There have been other times."" he
said a Uttie sadly.
H^r little white hand stole across the
table. There .was a -look in her eyes
which puzzled him.
"Confess, my dear husband," Annabel
said lightly, "that you -are bewildered "
Sir John smiled.

"Can you spare me a moment?" he
flsked. "I have a message from your

"Are you in a hurry?" she asked
carelessly. "A lot of these people will

"My message is urgent," he said
firmly. "If you cannot; listen to me

bluntly:

from Chelsea. He- bore it as long as he

fully about among her guests, always
gray, with a, smile and a whisper for

had pictured her, if indeed she had ever
had the courage to do this thing, as sit

starting at her own shadow, a slave to
constant terror. And instead he found
her playing the great lady, and playing
it well. She knew or guessed his mission,

mistake, hasn't it?"
"No more talking," the doctor inter
posed.
-"I want two wordsâ with Miss Pellis
sler alone." Hill replied.
. The. doctor, frowned. .
"Remember," he said; "you are not
by any means a dying man now, but
you'll never pull through If you don't
husband your strength."
"Two words only," HftT repeated.
They all left the room. Anna leaned
over so that he needed only to whisper.
"Tell your sister she was right to
shoot, quite right I meant mischief.
But tell her this, too. I believed that
our marriage was genuine. I believed
that she was my wife or she would
have been safe from me."
"I will tell her." Anna promised.
sai.e. Marriage would be your ruin.
You would be an adorable lover, but a
shocking husband."
"I think," he said sadly, "that you
do not mean to give me the opportun
ity of proving you* a lying, prophet.
In Paris you were at least heart
whole." - â¢ .
"You do not venture to assert that
I am anything else now," she ex
claimed.
"I do Â¦ not know. -You are changed.
You look like a worpan who has suf
fered, but who has looked for a little
while into the World Beautiful. No one
is ever quite the same afterwards."
"It may be," she answered softly,
"that you are .right." â¢ -.
They passed Annabel's jcreat hou*e in
Cavendish Square and Courtlaw stop
ped the cab.
"There are lights in the house still,"
he said. "Don't you think we ought to
let your sister know?"
They both climbed the steps and
Courtlaw raxie the bell. The do.or was
"We can wire in the morning,"
Courtlaw said, "or will they read it in
the papers? Anna, is this to be good
by?"
She save him her hand and the rare
tears stood in her eyes.
"May a woman have no friends,
then?" she exclaimed almost passion
ately. "Must I lose half the good in
life because I cannot split up my heart
into little pieces?"
"A woman who a lover," he
answered, "finds v her friends only an
embarrassment." ,,
"That," she declared, "is the most
banal thing I have ever heard you say,
and I think the most brutal. Besides
I have nd- lover yet. I don't want to
look at the world and all that is iu
it through one man's eyes. If I may
not have my friends I will never have
my lover."
He helped her to alight and his
fingers closed upon hers warmly.
, "The same Anna," he remarked,
smiling at her. "Well, count me al-
CHAPTER XXXIIIt
Montague Hill Plays the Game.
The man opened his eyes and looked
curiously about him.
"Where am I?" he muttered.
Courtlaw, who was sitting by the bed
side, Lent over him.
"You arc in a. private room of the St.
Felix Hospital," he said.
"Hospital? What *ior? What's tha
matter with me?"
Courtlaw s \oice sank to a, whisper.
A nurse was at the other end of tha
loom.
"Thtie was an accident with a pistol
in Miss Pellissier's room," he said.
The light of memory flashed in the
man's ia.ee. His brows drew a little
Dearer together.
"Accident! She shot me," he mut
tered. "1 had round her at last, and
she shot me. Listen, you. Am I going
to die?"
"1 am afraid that you are in a dan
gerous state," Courtlew" answered
gravely. "'Ihe nurse will fetch the doc
tor directly. I warned to speak to you
first."
"Who are you?"
"I am a tiiund of Miss Pellissler's,"
Courtlaw answered.
"Which one?"
"The Miss Pel Ussier in whose rooms
you were and who sings at the 'Uni
versal,' " Courtlaw answered. "The
Miss Ptllitsier \vhu was at White's
with us."
The man nodded
"I remember you now," he said. "So
it seems that 1 was wrong. Annabel
was in hiding all the time."
"Annabel Pellissier is married,"
Courtlaw said quietly.
"She's my wife," the man muttered.
"Is it possible," Courtlaw said, "that
you too were deceived. Where were
you married?"
"At the English Embassy in PariB.
You will find the certificate in my
pocket."
"And who mads the arrangements for
you and sent yo-u there?" Courtlaw
asked.
"Hainault. Celeste's friend. He did
everything."
"I thought so," Courtlaw said. "You,
too, were deceived. The place to which
you went w.as not the English Em
bassy, and the whole performance was
a fraud. I heard rumors of it in Paris
and the place since then has been
closed."
"But Hainault â assured â me â that thÂ«
marriage was binding."
"So it would have been at the EnÂ£~
lish Embassy," Courtlaw answered,
"but the place to which you west was
not the English Embassy. It was rig
ged up for the occasion as it has been
many a time before."
"But Hainaultâ wasâ a pal. I don't
understand." the man faltered wearily.
"Hainault was Celeste's friend and
Celeste was Annabel's enemy," Court
law said. "It was a plot among them
all to humiliate, her."
"Then she has never been my wife.v
"Never for a second. She is the wife
now of anc-ther man." ' "
Hill closed his eyes. For fully five
minutes he lay quite motionless. Then
he opened them again suddenly, to find
Courtlaw still by his- side.
"It was a bad day for me," he said,
speaking slowly, and painfully. "A bad
thing for me when that legacy came.
I thought I'd see Paris, do the thing
like a tofL And I heard Alcide sing
and that little dance she did. - I was
in the front row and I fancied she
smiled at me. Lord, what a state 1
was in! Night after night I sat there,

go. She dropped a flower â it's in my
pocket book now. I couldn't rest or
eat or sl?en. I made Hainault's ac
quaintance, stood him drinks, lent him
money. He shook his head all the time.
Annabel P.ellissier was not like the
others, he said. She had a. few ac
quaintances. English gentlemen, but
she lived with her sister â was a lady.
But one day he came to me. It was
Oleste's idea. I could be presented as
Meysey Hill. We were alike. He was
â a millionaire. And I passed myself
off as Meysey Hill and since â then â I
haven't had a minute's peace. " God
help me." . â¢
Courtlav.- wa3 alarmed at the man's
pallor.
"You musn't talk any more." he said,
"but I want you to listen to me for a
moment. The doctor will be here to
see you in five minutes. The nurse
sent for him as soon as she saw that
you were conscious. It is very possible
that he will ask you to tell him before
witnesses how you received your
aftvound." *
The man sniiled at him.
"You are their friend, then?"
"I am." Courtlaw answered.
"Which one?"
"The one whose life you have been
making a burden, who has been all the
time shielding: her sister. I would have
married her long ago, but she will not
have me."
"Bring herâ here." Hill muttered.
The door opened and the doctor en
tered softly. Hill closed his eyes.
Courtlaw stood up.
"He has asked to see some one." he
whispered to the doctor. "Is there any
ursf-ncy?"
The do'tor bent over his patient, who
seemed to have fallen asleep. Present
ly he turned to Courtlaw.
"I think," he said, "that I would
fetch any one whom he has asked to
xee. His condition is not unfavorable,
but there may be a relapse at any mo
ment."
So only a few minutes after Ennl
scn's departure, while Anna stood In
deed with her sister's open letter still
in her hand. Courtlaw drove up In hot
haste. She opened the door to him her
self.
"WiU you come round to the hospi
tal?" he asked. "Hill has sent for. you
and they will take his depositions to
nisht."
She slipped on her cloak and stepped
into the hansom with him. They
drove rapidly through the emptying
streets.
"Will he die?" she asked.
"Impossible to say," he answered.
"Vfe have a private room at St. Felix.
Everything Is being done. that can be."
"You are sure that he asked for meâ
not for Annabel?"
"Certain." Courtlaw answered.
"Has he accused any one yet?"
"Not yet." he answered. "I have
scarcely left his side."
He was still conscious when they
feached the hospital. On the whole his
state was more favorable. The doctor
and another man were by his bedside
when they entered the room and there
were writing materials which had evi
dently been used close at -hand. . He
recognized Anna and at once addressed
her.
"Thank youâ for coming," he said.
"The doctor has asked me to give them
my reasons â for shooting myself. . I've
told them all that was necessary, but
I â wanted to ask your pardon â for hav
ing madp mvaelf a nuisance to vou and
firmly.
' She shook her head.
"Don't!" she begged.
'â¢â¢You are in trouble." he said. "No
one has a bc-tter right than I to be with
you."' â¢ . .
. "You have no right at all," she an
swered coldly. . Â¦ â¢ â¢
"I have the right of the man who
loves you." he declared. "Sorrie day
you will be niy' wife and it would not
be. well lor' eilher of us to remember
that in these unhappy days you and I
VY^-re separated."
Anna gave her address to the driver.
She lr-ane-i back in the> cab with half
ciused eyes.
"'This 1 is all madness," she declared
Â¦svearily. "Do you think it is fair of
you to persecute me Just now?"
. "It is not persecution, Anna." he an
swered gently. "Only you are the

Annabel pulled up her veil.
"You are a dear." she exclaimed af

Sir John's reply was incoherent. He

"Right." he answered. "I know the

such an out-of-the-way show. I'll be

his hat and carefully gave his mus

"I really do not believe." he an

"You see. I will take your arm. It
looks so French to be affectionate." X
"There are some French customs,"
he declared, "v/hich are admirable, I
presume that I may not kiss you in the
street?"
"Certainly not, sir," she replied,
laughing. "If you attempted such a
thing it would be in order that I should
smack you hard with the palm of my
hand upon the' cheek."
"That is another French custom," he
remarked, "which is not so agreeable.
Here we are. Shall we sit outside and
drink a petit verre of something to give
us an appetite while dinner is being
prepared?"
"Certainly not." she answered. "I am
already so hungry that I shall begin
on the petits pains. I have an appetite
which I dare not increase."
They entered the place, a pleasant
little cafe of the sort to.be met with in
the outlying parts of Paris. Most of the
tables were for those who smoked only
and drank wine, but there were a few
spread with tablecloths and laid for
dinner. Sir John and Annabel seated
themselves at one of them and the pro
prietor himself, a small dark-visaged
man. radiant with smiles, came hurry
ing up. followed by a. waiter.
"Monsieur would dine! . It was very
good! And madame, of course?" with
a low bow. "The carte de jour was be

special attention and for the cooking â
well, he had his customers, who came
'rom their homes to him year after
year. And always they were well sat-
Bfled. He waited the pleasure of mon
sieur."
Sir John gave his order, deliberately
stumbling now and then over a word
and anglicizing others. When he had
finished he took up the wine list and
ordered a bottle of dry champagne.
"I am afraid." he said to Annabel
afterward, " that it was a mistake to
. order the champagne sec. They will
gues3 that I am English."
(Annabel leaned back In her chair and
laughed till the tears stood In her eyes.
"Did youâ did you really think that
they would take you for a French
man?" she exclaimed.
"I don't see why not." he answered.
"These clothes are French and I'm
sure this floppy bow would make a
Frenchman of me anyhow. Perhaps I
ought to have let you order the dinner,
but I think I got through it pretty
well."
"You did," Annabel exclaimed.
"Thank Ireaven, they are bringing the
hors d'oeuvres. John, I shall eat that
whole tin of sardines.-; Do take them
away from me after I Tiave had four."
"After all." Sir John remarked com
placently, "it is astonishing how easy
it is for people with brains and a little
knowledge of the world to completely
hide themselves. I am absolutely cer
tain that up to the present we have
escaped all notice, and I do not believe
that any casual observer would. take us
for English people."
A man who had been sitting with, his
hat tilted over his eyes at an adjacent
table had risen to his feet and stood
suddenly before them. . â¢Â¦
"Permit me to offer vou the English
paper which has lust arrived; Sir
John," he said, holding out a Daily
Telegraph. "You may find in it a para
graph of some interest to you.""
Sir John was speechless. It was An
nabet who caught at the paper. .
"Youâ appear to know my name,
sir," Sir John said.
"Oh, yes," the stranger remarked
rood humoredly. "I know you very
well by sight, Sir John. It is my busi
ness to know most people. We were
fellow passengers from Charing Cross,

Rue d'Entrepot. I trust you will not
accuse me of discourtesy, if I eipress

A little sobbing cry from Annabel ar
rested Sir John's attention. The stran-;
ger with a bow returned to Tils table.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL!.
Sir John, in a quiet dark traveling
suit; was sitting in a pokey little room
writing letters. The room was worse
than pokey, it was shabby, and the
view from the window of chimney pota
and slate roofs wholly uninspiring.
Nevertheless Sir John had the. look of
a man who was enjoying himself. He
seemed years younger and 1 the arrange
ment of his tie and hair were almost
rakish. He stamped his last. letter as
Annabel entered. -
iShe.was dressed for the street very
much as her own maid was accustomed
to dress and' there was a thick veil at
tached to her hat.
"John," she declared, "I must eat or

swered. "I really one him something
of an apology."
"I will tell him," Lady Lascelles
said. "And now !et us leave the men
alone and talk about ourselves."
"I am delighted to see you all here,"
Anna said, smiling upon them from
behind the tea-tray, "but I shall have
to ask you to excuse me for a few
minutes. My agent is here and he
has brought his contract for me to
sign. I will give jÂ»ou all some tea and
then I must leave you for a few min
utes."
The three men, who had arrived
v.ithin a minute or two of one anoth
er, received her little speech in dead
silence: Ennison, who had been stand
ing- with his back to the window, came
suddenly a little farther into the
room.
"Miss Pellissier," he said, "I came
here this afternoon hoping particular
ly to see you for a few moments be
fore you signed that contract."
She shook her head.
â¢ "We may just as well have our talk
afterward," she said, "and I need not
keep poor Mr. Earles waiting."
Courtlaw suddenly interposed.
'May I be allowed to say," he de
clared, "that I am here with the same
intention."
"And I also," Brendon echoed.
Anna was suddenly very quiet
She was perhaps as near tears as
ever before in her life.
"If I had three hands," she said,
with a faint smile. "I would give one
to each of you. I know that you are
ali my friends and I know that you all
have very good advice to give me. But
I am afraid I am a shockingly obsti
nate and a very ungrateful person. No.
don't let me call myself that. I am
grateful, indeed I am. But on this
matter my mind is quite made up."
Ennison hesitated for a moment
"Miss Pellissier," he said, "these
gentlemen are your friends and there
fore they are my friends. If I am to
have no other opportunity I -will speak
before them. I came here to beg you
not to sign that contract. I came to
beg you instead to do me the honor
of becoming my wife."
"And I." Courtlaw said, "although
I have asked before in vain, have
come to ask you once more the same
thing." .
"And I," Brendon said, humbly, "al
though I am afraid there is no chance
for. me, my errand was the same.
Anna looked at them for a moment
with a pitiful attempt at a smile. Then
her head disappeared suddenly In her
hands and her shoulders shook vio
lently.
"Please forgive me â for one mo
ment," she sobbed. "I â I shall be all
right directly."
Brendon rushed to the piano and
strummed out a tune.
. The others hurried to the window.
And Anna was -conscious of a few mo
ments of exquisite emotion. After all,
life had still Its pulsations. The joy
of being loved thrilled her as nothing,
before had ever done, a curious ab-
Ftract Joy which had -nothing In it at
that moment of regret or even pity.
She called them back very soon.
The signs of tears had all gone, but
some subtle change seemed to have
stolen into her face. She gpoke read
ily enough, but there was a new tim
idity in her manner. .
"My friends," she said, "my dear
friends, I am going to make the same
answer to all of you â and that is per
haps you will say no answer at all.
At present I cannot marry, I will not
become bound even to any one. It
would be very hard perhaps to make
you understand just how I feel about
it. I won't try. Only I feel that you
all -want to make life too easy for me
and I am determined to fight my own
battles a little longer. If any of you
âor all of youâ feel the same in six
months' time from to-day, will you
come, if you care to, and see me
then?"
There was .a. brief silence. Ennison
spoke at last.
"You will sign the contract?"
"I shall sign the contract I think
that I am very fortunate to have it to
sign."
"Do you mean." -Courtlaw asked,
"that from now to the end of six
months you do not wish to see us â
any of us?"
Her eyes were a little dim again.
"I do mean that," she declared. "I
want to have no distractions. My
work will be all sufficient. I have an
aunt who is coming to live with me,
and I do not intend to receive any
visitors at all. It will he a little lone
ly sometimes," she said, looking
around at them, "and I shall miss you
all, but It is thÂ« fairest for myself â
and I think for you. Do not avoid me
if we meet by accident, but I trust to
you all not to let the accident happen
if you can help it."
Brendon rose and came toward her
with outstretched hand.
'"Good-by, Miss Pellissier, and suc
cess to you," he said. "May you have
as much good fortune as you deserve,
but not enough to make you forget
us."
Courtlaw rose, too.
'Tou are of the genus obstinate,"
he said. "I do not know whether to
wish you success or not I will wish
you success or failure, whichever is
the better for you."
"And I," Ennison said, holding her
fingers tightly and forcing her to look
into his eyes, "I will tell you what I
have wished for you when we meet
six months from to-day."
CHAPTER XXXVI.
SIX MONTHS AFTER.
Upon the- moss-grown path, where
the rose bushes ran wild, almost met,
came Anna in a spotless white gown,
with the flush of her early morning
walk In her cheeks and something of
the brightness of it in her eyes. In
one hand she carried a long-stalked red
rose, dripping with dew, in the other
the post-bag.
She reached a tiny yellow-fronted
cottage covered with flowering creepers
and entered the front room by the wide
open window. Breakfast was laid for
one, a dish of fruit and a shining coffee
equipage. By the side of her plate
was a small key. With trembling
fingers she opened the post-bag. Thare
was one letter. Only one.
She opened it and read it at once. It
was dated from the House of Commons
oil the previous day.
"My Dear Miss Pellissierâ
"To-morrow the six months will
be up. For days I have been undecided
as to whether I would come to you or
"On or about the day you receive
this letter, Anna, the six months will
be up. Do you expect me, I wonder/
I think not. - At any rate, here
I am, and here I shall be, twenty
thousand feet above all your poison
reeking cities, up where God's wind
comes fresh from heaven, very near,
indeed, to the untrodden snows. Some
times I tremble, Anna, to think how
near I came to- passing through life
without a glimpse, a moment's revela
tion of this greatest and most awful of
mysteries, the mystery of primeval
nature. It is a true saying that in the
mountains there is peace. One's sense
of proportion, battered out of all shape
in the daily life of cities, reasserts it
self. I love you still, Anna, but life
holds other things than the love of man
for woman. Some day I shall come
âand if the papers tell the truth the
third is as bad. I believe I am doomed
to be an old maid."
She finished her ' breakfast and
strolled out across the garden with the
letter still in her hand. Beyond was a
Held sloping steeply upward, and at
the top a Email pine plantation. She
climbed slowly toward it, keeping
clc-se to the 1 hedge side, fragrant with
wild roses, and holding .her skirts high
above the dew-laden grass. Arrived in
the plantation' she sat down with her
back against a tree trunk. â¢
Already the warm, sun was drawing
from the pines their delicious odor. Be
low her stretched a valley of rich
meadowland, of yellow cornfields, and
beyond moorland hillside glorious with
purple heather and golden gorse. She
tried to compose her. thoughts, to think
said softly, "that It was precisely for
this I have worked so hard? It is just
the aim I have had in view all the
time. I wanted to have something to
give up. I- did not careâ no woman
really cafesâ to play the beggar maid
to your King Cophetua."
"Then you will really give it all up!"
he exclaimed.
She laughed.
"When we go indoors I will show you
the. offers I have refused," she
answered. "They have all been trying
to turn my head. I think that nearly
every manager in L'ondonjias made me
an offer. My reply to all' of them has
been the same. My engagement at the
'Garrick' terminates Saturday week,
and then I am free."
"You will make me horribly con
ceited," he answered. "I think that I
shall be the most unpopular man in
no. I would like you to believe that
the decision I have arrived* at âto stay
away â is wholly and entirely to save
you pain. It should be the happiest day
of your life, and I would not detract
from its happiness by letting j'ou re
member for a moment that there are
others to whom your inevitable decision
must bring some pain.
"For I know that you love Ennison.
You tried bravely enough to hide your
preference, to look at us all with the
same eyes, to speak to us in the same
tone. It was not your fault you failed.
If by any chance I have made a mis
take a word will bring me to you. But
I know very well that that word will
never be spoken.
"Your great success has been my joy,
our joy as well as yours. You have
made for yourself a unique placÂ» upon
the stage. We h^ve so many actresses
who aspire to great things la the
drama, not one who can interpret as
you have Interpreted it, the delicate
finesse, the finer lights and shades of
true comedy. Ennison will mak-j a thou
sand enemies if he takes you from the
stage. Yet I think that he will do it.
"For my own part I have come ful
ly now into my inheritance. I am
bound to admit that I greatly enjoy
my altered life. Every minute I
spend here is an education to me. Be
fore very long I hope to have definite
work. Some of my schemes are al
ready In hand. People shrug their
shoulders and call me a crazy social
ist. Yet I fancy that we who have
been poor ourselves must be the best
judges of the needs of the people.
"You will write to me, I am sure â
and from the date of your letter I
trust most earnestly that I may come
back to my old place as
"Your devoted friend.

She set the letter down and drew
from her pocket another with a for
eign postmark which had come the
day before. This one, too, she road.

back and I will show you on canvas
the things which have come to me up
here among the eternal silence.
"Many nights I have thought of you,
Anna, Your face has flitted out of my
watch-fire and then I have been a
haunted man. But with the morning,
the glorious unstained morning, the
passion of living would stir even the
blood of a clod. It comes over the
mountains, Anna, pink darkening into
orange red, everywhere a wonderful
cloud sea. scintillating with color. It is
enough to make a man throw away
canvas and brushes Into- the bottomless
precipices, enough to make one weep
with despair at his utter and absolute
unimportance. Nature is God, Anna,
and the greatest artist of us all a
pigmy. When I think of those ateliers
of ours, the art jargon, the decadents
with their flamboyant talk, I long for
a two-edged sword and a minute of
Divinity. To perdition with them all.
"I shall come back, if at all, a new
man. I have a new cult to teach, a
new enthusiasm. I feel years younger,
a man again. My flrst visit will be to
you. I must tell you all about God's
land, this marvelous virgin country,
with its silent forests and dazzling
peaks. I make no apology for not
being with you now. You love Enni
son. .. Believe me, the bitterness' of it
has almost departed, crushed but of me
together with much of the weariness
and sorrow I brought with me here by
the nameless glory of these lonely
months. Yet I shall think of you to
day. I pray, Anna, that you may find
your happiness. Your friend,
"DAVID COURTLAW."
"P. S. â I do not congratulate you on
your success. I was certain of it. I am
glad or sorry according as it has
brought you happiness."
Anna's eyes were a little dim as she
pcmreS out her coffee, and the laugji
she attempted was not altogether a
success.
"This is all very well," she said, "but
two out of the three are rank deserters
of the last six months, to steep herself
in the calm beauty of the surround
ings. And she found herself able to do
nothing of the sort. A new restless
ness seemed to have fallen In
upon her. She started at the
falling of a leaf, at the lumbering
of a cow through the hedge. Her
heart was beating with quite unaccus
tomed vigor, her hands were hot, she
was conscious of a warmth in her
blood which the summer sunshine was
scarcely â¢ responsible for. She strug
gled against it Quite uselessly. She
knew very well that a new thing was
stirring in her. The period of repres
sion was over. It is foolish, she mur
mured to herself, foolish. He will not
come. He cannot.
And then all her restlessness was
turned to joy. She sprang to her feet
and stood listening with parted lips
and eager eyes. So he found her when
he came around the corner of the spin
ney.
"Anna." he cried eagerly.
She held out her arms to him and
smiled.
â¢ * â¢
"And where," he asked, "are my ri
vals?" -
; "Deserters," she answered, laughing.
"It is you alone, Nigel, who have saved
me from being an old maid. Here are
their letters." Â£ \ \.
He took them from her and read
them. When he came to- a certain sen
tence in Brendon's letter he stopped
short and looked up at her.
"So Brendon and I," he said, "have
been troubled with the same fears. I,
too, Anna, have watched and read of
your success withâ I must confess it
some misgiving."
"Please tell me why?" she asked.
"Do you need me to tell you? You
have tasted the luxury of power. You
have made your public, you are already
a personage. And I want you for my
self â for my wife."
She took his hand and smiled upon
him.
"Don't you understand, Nigel," she

night; are you?"
"Not to-night," she answered. "I am
giving my understudy a chance. I am
going up to dine with my sister."
"Annabel is a prophetess," he de
clared. "I, too, am asked."
"It is a conspiracy," she exclaimed.
"Come, we must go home and have
some luncheon. My little maidservant
will think that I am lost."
They clambered down the hill to
gether. The air was sweet with the
perfume of flowers, and the melody of
murmuring insects, the blue sky was
cloudless, the heat of the sun was
tempered by the heather-scented west
wind. Ennison paused by the little
gate.
"I think," he said, "that you have
found the real home of the lotos eaters.
Here one might live the life of golden
days." â¢
She shook her head gently.
"Neither you nor I, Nigel, is made
of such stuff," she answered. "These

He kissed her on the lips.

n < AMMOND, strong, alert, silent,
. I \ guided his dashing automobile
1 I in and out amid the crush of
J traffic. His companion was
silent, also, which fact might
have disconcerted a less observant man
than Hammond.
He stopped the machine before* a
massive granite building and sprang
to the sidewalk. Miss Markham
watched him absently. He had said
that he must stop at his office, but
the waiting was not unwelcome to
her. She liked to watch the great
drays and heavy wagons and to ob
serve the sights and sounds of this un
familiar part of the city.
Presently she noticed that Ham
mond had not entered the building,
but was standing In the doorway,
looking up and down the street as if
watching for some one. He caught her
wandering glance and waved his hand,
smiling brightly. Then he put both
hands to hia mouth,, making a horn,
and called something to her which she
could not hear above the roar of the
street.
"He Is like a boy," she thought, and
laughed in 'sympathy with his evident
joyousness. "There is never any gloom
or any uncertainty about him," adding
sadly, "men are so sure of themselves
âand of one another. I wishâ I wish
I knew if he thinks only of my money
as all the others seem to do."
Still watching his eager face she
knew that whatever he had been wait
ing for was . coming, and he pointed
up the street and laughed again as
he ran lightly down the steps.
Two young Italians, a man and a
woman, were making ready to. play.
The girl wore a rose wreath on her
dark hair and her eyes were filled
with the light of love as she looked
fondly in the face of her companion.
The strains of the music came to
Miss Markham in fitful snatches, min
gled with the noises of the street. She
saw that Hammond was listening as
if to a symphony, and she wondered
a little as to the meaning of the scene.
She saw him place something in the
girl's small, brown hand and then the
man took off his cap with low obeis
ance and the girl court esied prettily
as Hammond raised his hat politely
and made his way to the automobile.
"What is it?" she questioned briefly,
as he took is seat.
"Only the beautiful outcome of a
little romarft-e that I have watched as
$t blossomed here amid the sordid
rush of business."
"They are lovers â .these two?" fall
ing in with his mood.
"Yes, wedded last night. Two mag
nificent types of primitive humanity!"
with the enthusiasm of artistic per
ception.
They watched the two as they went
down the street, each pushing the
piano with one hand, while the other
hands were clasped.
"Will you tell me about them?" she
asked as they reached a broad, quiet
avenue away from the din and con
fusion of the city.
"Are you really interested?" turn-
Ing to look at her curiously.
"Very much so! Please tell me."
"They - are Antoine and Caritaâ
they may have other names â these are
all I know. I have watched them
from my window all winter. He had
a tiny fruit stand on the corner and
she was errand girl in a big millinery
establishment on the next street. I
saw the flrst love glances, and I swear
fcy Bunker Hill they did riot come
from Antoine."
Miss Markham laughed softly.
"I watched Carita passing and re
passing, making several trips by the
little stand for each errand. Then
there would be days when she did not
come at all, and Antoine's neck would
have been safer In those days if It had
really been made of rubber instead of
the material provided by the Creator."
Miss Markham smiled appreciatively.
She could fancy the ardent Italian gaz
ing up and down the street, watching
for his sweetheart.
"Well, occasionally making pretens*
of an abnormal desire for bananas, I
rushed out to the stand while Bhe was
still lingering there, and so I some
times overheard a few sentencesâ their
soft Italian love words sounding like
bird notes in spring. Can't you fancy
them building a nest somewhere of
boughs and mossâ they wouldn't re
quirq much more than the birds, you
knowâ and settling down like the birds
to sins: their love songs and rear their
young?"
A new light shone in Miss Markham's
clear eyes.
Hammond's head swam for an in
stant with a comprehension of the
magnitude- of what he meant to do, but
he went on steadily.
/"The day of the tornadoâ you re
member itâ when' the wind tore shut
ters from the houses and overthrew
chimneys, and great limbs were
stripped from the trees as the small
boy pulls leaves from a twigâ that day
I witnessed the downfall of the House
of Buona, In other words, the com
plete destruction of Antoine's fruit
stand and peanut-cooker."
"Poor Antoine! He made one or two
frantic endeavors to prevent the dis
aster, and then, crushed by the mis
fortune, he clung to the doorway of the
office building and watched the gamins
as they wildly scrambled for the scat
tered fruit."
"And was everything: entirely
ruined?" Miss Markham's hand in
stinctively sought her purse.
The peanut-cooker lay in the mud,
bent and twisted out of all semblance
to its kind. Antoine picked .it up with
trembling hands, and then realizing
its uselessness, replaced it in the gut
ter, while the tears streamed down
his cheeks.
"That isn't all?" expectantly.
Hammond continued obediently:
" 'Never mind, Antoine,' I said cheer
fully â it's so easy to be cheerful over
another's misfortunes, you knowâ
'you'll soon be on your feet again.
We must expect reverses in business/
At my words of sympathy the flood
gates of his grief were opened, and
the . words fairly tumbled ovar one
another, his soft, broken English
finally relapsing into Italian altogether
as he told his story. He had been so
careful of. his money â he had saved
twenty-three 'dolla.' They were to
have been married to-morrow, he and
Carita; and he was to have bought
Carita a new gown and a rose wreath
for her hair, and they would have
been so happy! And now â then he
pointed eloquently to the ruined pea
nut-cooker, waved both hands in a
gesture expressing the utter nothing
ness of his condition, and the ready
tears came again.
"I missed him then for several
weeks. T*ie other day they came to
gether and waited until I came out
from my office. 'My brudda â he die,'
began Antoine cheerily, as soon as I
joined them. 'An' leave Antoine sev
enty-four dolla.' said Carita, her eyes
big with the magnitude of the for
tune. 'An' his business,' Antoine
added pompously. 'Did he have a
stand?' I asked him. 'No, a piano.
We married ourselves to-night, Thurs
day.' "
Hammond paused abruptly.
"Antoine hunted me up last night â
at the club. Said his wife â you should
have seen his eyes when he said the
word â his wife wanted to come and play
for me first, believing it would bring
them luck. I hadn't intended to go
down town this morning, as you know;
but I thought that was really very
little to do if it would add anything
to their happiness. Foolish things,
aren't they?" He turned his head
awayâ she would agree with this, of
eourpe, and he couldn't bear to have
her do so.
She put her hand lightly on his arm.
"No, they are not foolish. They are
wise. They have found the greatest
thing In the world. Those who win love
need look no further; there is nothing
more to have here. They who lose it
lose everything."
He put his own strong hand over the
smaller one resting on his arm.
"Shall jre look for itâ together, Eliza
beth?"
She looked hastily aboutâ there was
no one near, . they were quite in the
country nowâ and raised her beautiful
face to his. "I think we have found it
already," she whispered.
"The balance of fault is on my side,"
Anna said softly. "We will drink for-,
getfulness to all those things which are
better forgotten." . . Â¦ ".'Â¦Â¦'.
"It may interest you to know," Sir
John remarked, setting down his glass,.
"that the wine came from the cellars
of a very rising young firm: of wine

I met them together in Regent street

Sir John thrust his hand Into his

"Buying these little mementoes of a

producing two morocco cases, one of
which he passed to Anna and one to
Annabel. "Come> Ennison, the car

They Jeft the room amidst . a little
duologue of delight. Sir John knew
how to make handsome presents and
had sufficiently good taste not to at
tempt to choose them himself. Anna

off herself. She lit his cigarette,
pulled his tie straight and rearranged
the orchid in his buttonhole. When

Back in. Cavendish Square- the -"two .
girls were sitting over the fire in An
nabel's own rooms. They were sitting
very close together, and there were
traces of tears- in Annabel's eyes. -
"I think, Anna," she . said softly,
"that I am cured forever of expecting
romance only from romantic people./

seemed to me fair to tell hjm. and yet

Anna nodded. â¢ " '..-': .
"I too, think, dear," she answered,

continued, "as. hide-bound In conven

"People are always so different from

him just because you feel, sure . that
you know all about him and exactly

and you rub your eyes and feel very
small. The timid person becomes a
hero, the stolid person discloses a mar
vellous vein of sentiment, the clrtuoua
person shocks us, and the rake becomes
a puritan. Look at our friend Mr.
Montague Hill, a vulgar, passionate
man, half crazed with his own folly.;

Anna came first from the nursery,
and waiting for her sister drew Â¦ aside
for a moment the curtains which hung,
before the window.. It came to her
with a momentary flash of recollection,
that at the three great crises of her In-'
ward life she had found herself like
this, looking out into the night. Was
it some secret desire for the sympathy
of these millions of her . felloWrcrea
tures, these sleeping and toiling and
pleasure-hunting sons . and daughters
of the world, or was It perhaps because
the strain of life and her- own emotions
had suddenly, become so tense that the

So much had happened since the flat of
David Courtlaw and her own passion
ate desire for real and Intimate con
tact with life and its natural forces
had made of her something of an ad
venturess. Yet she was conscious now
of a certain delightful sense of .rest.
She had notched her experiences deep,
she felt herself no longer a dilettante
in emotions. She had passed lightly
through the maelstrom of life, she
knew now what was meant by the
storm and the swirl and the tempest
of living. And before her

THE homely things, the affairs of

human contradictions that we are
prone to leap from the dizzy heights

glaring romance back to the good old
humdrum of the dally round with an

So Opie Read was the author of
"Confessions of Marguerite," which
appeared anonymously some eight
months ago. The riddle is solved by
the appearance of a second edition,
bearing the author's name, after these
many months have witnessed the
usual amount of speculation and
vague hints about the conventional
literary "lady in black" â hints given
out gratuitously by eaterprisins pub
lishers who scent the value of a liter
ary mystery. Well. Opie Read's name
doe3 not make "Confessions of Mar
guerite" any the better book. As we
had occasion to say at the time of the
novel's first appearance, this autobio
graphical plaint about the -wickedness
of Chicago, especially as manifested
toward young and defenseless fe
males from Wisconsin, is not a book
to set the literary world ablaze.

Charles G. D. Roberta,- whose ani
mal stories have become quite ' as
much the accepted standard of .such
style of fiction as those of.Thornpsoa
Setoa himself, has had repub'lished in
book torm two of his tales -which ap
peared In Outing two years back, "The-
Haunter of the Pine Gloom" and "The
Watchers of the Campfire." Though
these two little books have been fitted
out -with large print and attractive il
lustrations by Bull, evidently for boys'
reading, there Is in each a man story
well worth the reading. The lynx and
the panther, certainly most fearsome
beasts to those who have chanced to
stumble on them ia the forests, are
made the subjects of the two sketches,

"Watchers of the Trail" can tell ah

Now, this is only one of the incidents
in Arthur Morrison's story of mys
tery, "The Green Diamond," but cer
tainly the imagination that is able to
conjure up such a riddle as the
foregoing 1 deserves a reading- for
its startling figments. It may
be improbable that a young Eng
lishman could possibly solve the
rebus of an Indian sign-message
such as this; it may be impossible that
any right-minded Indian could excect
other than a member of his race to de
cipher his blind communication; buttha
reader does not pause to consider these
things as he hurries along with the
author on the trail of the great green
diamond, stolen from the Rajah of
Goona.
It is at the great Durbar at Delhi
that the bold theft of this, the most
wonderful of all gems, is made. To fa
cilitate Its speedy removal from the tu
multuous scene of the crime one of the
thieves secretes the priceless stone In
one of the dozen magnums of imperial
tokay and ships it thus to England
under the care of a friend. By a griev
ous mistake the bottles- are auctioned
off at Southampton! and scattered to
the four parts of the British Isles. One
of these precious magnums contains a
king's ransom and of course the tale
hangs breathlessly upon the details of
the frantic search for the right one.
both by the robbers and by the unsus
pecting individual who was made the
innocent tool of the thieves at first, but
.who later awoke to a realization of the
stake in the game. A double murder,
sudden assassination and a suicide
blot the course of the diamond's nere
grinations and after all it still remains
hidden in some secret corner of Lon
don, with the lips of Its latest owner
sealed in death.
Mr. Morrison is a good story teller,
readers of "The Red Triangle" will
unanimously affirm- "The Green Dia
mond" Is a good story and 'well told.
But why does the hero assume such an
attitude of. strict righteousness at the
end of the tale when the hunted dia
mond thief offers to take him ia on the
. f% MYSTERIOUS camphor- wood
is received by post. In It is
the following assortment of rub
bish:" A chip of marble, a bit of cork, a
diminutive brass tube, a withered tu
lip flower, a splinter of green glass, ten
cloves and eighteen hemp seeds. From
this Harvey Crook, amateur detective
and diamond hunter, deduces the fol
lowing message: "Give up that won
derful diamond, the Green* Eye of Goo
na, which you found in a bottle oÂ£ To
kay, on the ISth of the month. 'You
will make the transfer at the Marble
Arch station of the London under
ground railroad. Failure to follow these
explicit directions will result In a gory
death for you."

many years. To a book of little essays
on the commonplace of life, then, such
at- Marion Foster Washburn has
wrought for us in her "Everyday
Essays," we turn in natural anticipa
tion of satisfying pleasure. The pleas
ure in full measure is there for the
reading.
Few bachelors will find anything in
teresting in Marion Washburn's book:
nor will the self-styled bachelor maid
of the ordinary stock read out uf it
anything with an appeal direct. For
most, of the everyday essays tell of a
mother's sphere, a mother's joys and
tribulations. The average reader who
sits up at nights over^ "Rulers of
Kings," say, or "The Transgression .of
Andrew Vane." will not let his eye
linger over details concerning the sew
ing of a button on Willie's canton
flannel pajamas or th* rescue of*Helen
from the recesses of the coal box; but
to those whose small Willie or Helen
at home is monarch of a realm en
chanted "Everyday Essays" brings the
essence of close and sweet familiarity.
The author writes of the comedies
of nursery and the tragedies of
kitchen. She writes for those who
know by heart 'Gene Field's "Pitty-
Pat and TiDry-Toe."
"I wonder why children wake so
early in the morning?" queries the
author in her first essay. "Why is it
that when elders are trying to get the
last wink youngsters come clamoring
and clambering into the darkened
chamber at peep o' day? Read- of the
every morning's comedy that ensues
and laugh in ready recognition of Its
familiar features. Jamie says you're
"mad" if you won't accord him a
sleepy kiss; young Willie makes a
tent of his bedclothes and refuses to
allow the growling wild animal en
sconsed therein to be. dressed. Cook
stayed out all night and the kitchen
stove glowers in forbidding coldness.
A hasty breakfast gulped and you
must write an excuse to the teacher
for this one or find the jacket and
hat for that â but enough; how many
know the scene? But then at night,
when the rebellious little souls are
stilled to the approach of sleep and
prayer time comes:
"The children must stop their play
ing, it seems; they must speak to God
a little; they must resign their sover
eign wills. With what jaunty irrele
vance it Is done! Was there ever a
more spirited surrender? They swag
ger in the very face of divinity, and
Bpeak their prayers with lips full of un
daunted curves. The solemn words of
the set supplications are broken with
irresponsible giggles. Tet there is a
reverence in the very midst of this
seeming irreverence. There is a touch
ing certainty that the Heavenly Father
will not be offendedâ that he will hear
and understand."
The meaning of home â a theme old
but always freshâ Is interpreted anew
by the author. How our little efforts at
adornment, how our instinct of associa
tion aerve to surround our . abiding
places with the atmosphere distinct In
its essence, compelling In its power;
how the ties of the old home of child
hood pull against the new bonds of the
new home; how the daily round ever
has home In the prospective of en
deavors. This Is ground oft plowed,
but again gone over in happy review.

Y 7 OWARD V. SUTHERLAND, one
S 3 of our local poets -whose lyre
has been tuneful these many
years, has issued a little booklet of
verse under the title "Songs of a City."
which contains some lines of right
true poetry. ""Home" is used advised
ly, for in several of his stanzas Mr.
Sutherland has let the -thought run
away with the rreter and there H .1
limp here and there. However, he
that keeps his eyes too close to schema
of foot and measure is destined to
miss the Iargre spirit of things in
poetry, and so the few slips in "Songs
of a City" need have no crying call
for condemnation.
Familiar things of San Francisco
and the State put in verse with a
"Lyrical Intermezzo"; this is the sum
of Mr. Sutherland's verse collection.
The veil of the fog, the glory of sun
shine on the Gate, the hurrying
crov/ds of noonday and the silent
streets of night all have for the poet
various significance and are themes
for verse. Of the city songs here is
the best:
A eolden glory lights the westâ
The sun's lareviell;
One chime sounds clearer than ths restâ
The daytime's knell.
TfcÂ« western skies are crimsoned now
Ana â¢ lijed with gray;
The beams frum Tamaipals' brow
HavÂ« passed away.
On Alcatraz the light is lit.
The bay is still;
And Eoon thÂ» truant mists will flit
O'er dell and hill.
So itUl thÂ» town this Sabbath night.
So calm the air.
One almcEt sees the angsls light
Those stars up there'.
A delicate little conception, this,*
with the simple movement carrying
the sense of the words with it.
Something deeper yes in two poems
addressed to the poet's personal friend
and fellow Einger, the late Richard
Realf. In the second of these, "The
Higher Praise." Sutherland has ffiven
vGdce to an old thought with impres
sive soberness.
Beneath a mound of simple green there lay
A man who sang yet lacks the deathless bay.
And lies unheeded, though his art was (Teat;
But white I mused the wind from o'er the sea
With scented breath crept gently up to me
And whispered low: "Unloved of all save
fate."
Mr. Sutherland has full measure of
the spirit of sons as all of his versas
show. With imagination { quickened
into more freedom and originality of
metaphor than he has possession of,
the singer should not be lacking "the
deathless bay" of a local awarding at
least.

street, San Francisco; price 51.)

man in the story and she exaggerates
the effects of the blasted affections
in the old musician and his sweetheart.
It is hard to imagine a young man's
writing: Impassioned love letters un
der the rose while he shows extreme
indifference to the object of his af
fections in every-day intercourse.
Equally fanciful Is it to conceive of an
individual, disappointed in his youth
ful love for a fair one, carving out a
stone cross in a lonely dell of the
woods and visiting it regularly for
twenty-five years with tears and la
mentations. Nor, Incidentally, Is It a
usual thing for an aged gentleman Â«of
seventy-five summers to make sudden
declaration of love to a faded German
lady of uncertaia age, merely that he
may help a friend achieve his happi
ness thereby.
A poor story, filled with beautiful
conceits. Had the author Incorporated
the Incident of the unique affection be
tween Aunt Peace, the sweet, aristo
cratic old spinster, and lovable old Dr.
Brinkerhoff Into a short sketch the re
sult would have been beyond cavil.
Perfectly haÂ« she given us the atmos
phere of quiet dignity and cheerful old
age which envelops the silver haired
mistress of the ancient Field house of
East Lancaster; with the suggestive
strokes of a charcoal sketch does she
outline the wholesome, old-time phil
osophy of her existence. Then the
Wednesday night calls of the doctor,
the little comedy of the cakes and the
port wine at the end of each visit and
the old lady's stout assertion that he
is a good man, "though he has no so
cial position" â these things make this
secondary plot of the story the one of
the most beauty. la these words does
Myrtle Reed make Aunt Peace review
her life:
"When a little pleasure has flashed
for a moment against the dark I have
made that jewel mine. I have hun
dreds of them, from the time when my
baby fingers clasped my first rose, to
the night you and Lynn came to bring
more sunshine Into my old life. I call it
my necklace of perfect joy. When the
world goes "VfTonjr I have only to close
y y O"W unfortunate it is that even
ji authors have human limitations.
So many times the -writer tha,t
has ideas pregnant with beauty and
exalted esthetic spirit fails of the right
form in their presentation, or vice
versa, he usurps a remarkably strik
ing conveyance for the expression of
things which merit not a whit of con
sideration. In the instance of Myrtle
Reed's "The Master's Violin" we find
thoughts most beautiful springing out
of a novel that is unwieldy in plot and
weak in construction. Delicate senti
ment, finely worded reflections upon
life and things, phrases that have al
most the ring of blank verse in stately
and sonorous diction, here abound; but
the novel â that is nothing. "Love
Letters of a Musician" had all the
beauty of this last piece of work with
out the failings. "Lavender and Oi<i
Lace" was exquisite in its tenderness
and delicate fancy. "The Spinster
Book" sparkled with fine wit. Had
the creator of these books only been
content to remain within the bonds
of form set by them, "The Master's
Violin" would be near perfection.
A novel, then, this is â a novel set to
a theme too poetic for fiction. How
the musician's heart must be fined by
sorrow and bitter strife before it can
be attuned to a master sense; how
enly out of the depths of despair there
can arise the genius of true music â
this is the theme of "The Master's
Violin." Allegorical almost in its ex
emplification of the theme and too
transcendental to fit the requirements
of fiction is the plot woven by the au
thor about the struggles of two
musicians to attain the heights of per
fection. In each Instance the gTeat
sorrow that comes to purify and rarefy
the artistic sense is that of love dis
appointed; in the case of both the
spirit of music rises triumphant out of
the wrecks of fond hopes and tender
passion.
my eyes and remember all the links in
my chain, set with gems, some large
and some small, but all beautiful with
the beauty which never fades. It is
all I can take with me when I go. My
material possessions must stay behind,
but rr.y necklace of perfect joy will
bring me happiness to the end. when
I put it on to be nevermore unclasped."
This passage may also serve to show
the beauty and the stately grace of the
author's diction. Rarely In our books
of to-day â written in six months or
less to fill a publisher's contract â do
we find such a rhythmic and a sound
ing language as Myrtle Reed indulges.
"I he poetic grace of her imagery and
the swing of some of her paragraphs
give to "The Master's Violin" the
beauty of a prose poem.

Another faux pas on the part of the
Scotch Baronet gives Virginia oppor
tunity to voice one of Mrs. Wiggins*
clever little aphorisms on the British
tlnntness. In a moment of rare un
bending Sir Archibald had asked the
young American miss if she was blessed
with a large circle of relatives. Upon
her reply to the contrary he naively
declared: 'Good thing, too, I dare say.
They say you can't te'l anything about
en American family by seeing one of
them."
"Upon my word." gasped Virginia in
mental comment. "The hopeless candor
cf cur brethren of the British Isles is
astonishing. Sometimes' after a pro
longed conversation with two or three
cf them I feel like going 1 about the
drawing-room with a small broom and
dust pan and sweeping up the home
truths that should lie in scattered pro
fusion on the floor."
On the other side of the question
Charlotte Stewart (Allan McAulay)
follows the cogitations of the Scotch,
bachelor with admirable wit and keen
Insight. From a self-centered man of
almost boorish proclivities, whose utter
abomination is womankind, we see the
sturdy Scotsman fall by steady and
fatal degrees into the inevitable snare

story cf adoration: This personage is

skill little less than Mrs. Wiggins' own.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
EARLY FALL STOCK OF BOOKSletter cither is sealed or that it is not sealed. I have never been
able yet to solve this problem. If your letter is sealed it then
appears that it ought not to have been sealed. If on the other
hand you have omitted to seal it, that is your fault. In either
case, the letter cannot go as it is. The continental official brings
up the public on the principle of the nurse who sent the eldest
girl to see what Tommy was doing and tell him he mustn't. Your
friend having wasted half an hour and mislaid his temper for the
day, decides to heave this thing over and talk to the hotel porter
about it. Next to the Burgomaster, the hotel porter is the most
influential man in the continental town; maybe because he can
swear in seven different languages. But even he js not omnipo
tent.
Three of us, on the point of starting for a walking-tour
through 'trie Tyrol, once sent on our luggage by post from Con
stance to Innsbruck. Our idea was that, reaching Innsbruck in
the height of the season, after a week's tramp on two flannel
shirts and a change of socks, we should be glad to get into fresh
clothes before showing ourselves in civilized society.' Our bags
were waiting for us in the postoffice ; we could see them through
â¢the grating. But some informality â I have never been able to
understand what it was â had occurred at Constance. The sus
picions of the Swiss postal authorities had been aroused, and spe
cial instructions had been sent that, the bags were to be delivered
up only to their rightful owners. It sounds sensible enough. No
body wants his bag delivered up to any one but the proper
owner. But it had not been explained to the authorities at
Innsbruck how- they were to know the proper owners. Three
wretched looking crÂ«atures crawled into the postoffice and said
they wanted those three bags â "those bags, there in the corner,"
which were nice, clean, respectable looking bags ; the sort of bags
that any, one might want. One of. them produced a bit of paper,
it is true, which he said had been given to him as a receipt by
the postoffice people at Constance. But in the lonely passes of
the Tyrol one man, set upon by three, might easily be robbed of
his papers and his body thrown over a-precipice. The chief clerk
shook his head; he was a kindly looking man; but he had had his
instructions^ to' be careful and he intended to be careful! He
would like us to return accompanied by some one who coul^
identify us. The hotel porter occurred to us as a matter of course?
Keeping to the back streets we; returned to the hotel and fished

bureaucracy. Human adaptability has its limits. Let the stamp
seller" stick to his stamps, the dispenser of postal orders save
himself up for postal orders. Some twenty different, windows,
confront your troubled friend, each one bearing its own peculiar
legend. Starting with number one he sets to work to spell them
out.. It appears to him that the posting of the letters is not a
.ihiiitr that the German postoffice desires to encourage. Would hf
not like a dog license instead, is what one window suggests to
him. "Oh, never mind that letter of yours; come and talk about
bicycles." pleads another. At last lie thinks he has found the
right hole ; the word "Registration" he distinctly recognizes. Hf
ta]*s at the glass.
. Nobody takes any notice of him. The foreign official is a
man whose life is saddened by a public aftvays wanting some
thing. You read it in his face wherever you go. The man who
sells you tickets for the theater! He is eating sandwiches when
you knock at his window. He turns to his companion: "Good
Lord!' you can see him say, "Here's another of 'em. If there
has been one man worrying me this morning there have been a
hundred. Always the same story; all of 'em want to come see
the play. You listen now; bet you anything he's going to bother
me for tickets. . Really, it gets on my nerves sometimes.'' At the
railway station it is just the same. "Another man who wants to
go to Antwerp! Don't seem to care for rest, these people; flying
here, flying there; what's the sense of it?" It is the absurd craze
on the part of the public for letter-writing: it is spoiling the
temper . of the continental postoffice official. He does his best
to discourage it: "Look at them," he says to his assistant. The
thoughtful continental Government is careful to provide
every official with another official to talk to, lest by sheer force of
ennui he might be reduced to taking interest in his work.
"Twenty of 'em, all in a row; some of 'em been there for the
last quarter of an hour." "Let 'cm wait another quarter of an
hour," advises the assistant ; "perhaps they'll go away." "My
dear fellow," he answers, "do you think I haven't tried that?
There's simply no getting rid qf 'em ; and it's always the same
cry, 'Stamps! staipps! stamps!' Pon my word, I think they live
on stamps, some of 'em." "Well, let 'em have their stamps," sug
gests the assistant with a burst of inspiration, "perhaps it' will
get rid of 'em." "What's the use," wearily the older man re
plies; "there'll only come a fresh crowd when those are gone."
"Oh, well," argues the other, "that will be a change, anyhow.
Frn tired of looking at this lot." I put it to a German postoffice
clerk once ; a man I had been- boring for months. I said : "You
think I write these letters â these short stories, these three-act
plays on purpose to annoy you. Do let me try and get the idea
out of your head. Personally, I hate work â hate it as much as
you do. This is a pleasant little town of yours! given a free
choice, I could spend the whole day mooning round it, never put
ting pen to paper. But what am I to do? I have a wife and
children. You know what it is yourself ; they clamor for food,
boots, all sorts of things. I have to prepare. these little packets
for sale and bring them to you to send off. You see, you are here.
If you were not here, if there were no postoffice in this town,
maybe I'd have to train pigeons or cork the thing up in a bottle,
fling it into the river and trust to luck and the gulf stream. But
yoii being here and tailing yourself a postoffice â well, it's
a temptation to a fellow." I think it did good. Anyhow, after
that he used to grin when I opened the door, instead of greeting
me as formerly with a face the picture of despair. But to return
to our inexperienced friend.
.-; At last the wicket is suddenly opened. A peremptory official
demands of him "name and address." Not expecting the ques
tion, he is a little doubtful of his address and has to correct him
self once or twice. The official eyes him suspiciously. "Name of
mother?" continues the official. "Name of what?" "Mother!" re
peats the official; "had a mother of some sort, I suppose?" He
is a man who loved his mother sincerely while she lived, but she
has been dead these twenty years, and for the life of him he can
not recollect her name. He thinks it was Margaret Henrietta, but
is not at all sure. Besides, what on earth has his mother got to
do with this registered letter that he wants to sent to his partner
in" New York. "When did it die?" asks the official. "When did
what die? Mother?" "No', no, the child." "What child?" The
indignation of the official is almost picturesque. "All I want to
do." explains your friend, "is to register a letter â " "A what?"
"This letfer I wantâ" The window is slammed in his face.
When ten minutes later he does reach the right wicket the bu
reau for the registration of letters and not the bureau for the
registration of infantile deathsâ it is pointed put to him that the

""~|-~"HKRE is one thing that the Anglo-Saxon does better
I than the "French or Turk or Rooshian," to which add
e the German or the Belgian.. When the Anglo-American
appoints an official he appoints more or less a servant :
when the Frenchman and the others put a man in gold
braided-uniform they add another to their long list of masters.
If among your acquaintances you can discover an American or
Englishman unfamiliar with the continental official, it is worth
your while to accompany him, the first time he goes out to post a
Ictton say. He advances toward that postoffice a breezy, self
eoniKlent gentleman, borne up by pride of race. While mount
ing the steps he talks arily of: Just getting this letter off his
mincf, and then picking up JoLson and going on to Durand's for
luncheon. He talks as if he had got the whole day before him.
At the top of the steps he attempts to push open 'the door. It
will not- move. He looks about him and discovers that it is the
door of egress, not of ingress. It does not seem to him worth
while reclescending the twenty steps and climbing- another
twenty. So far as he is concerned he is willing to pull the door
instead of pushing it. But a stem official bars his way and
haughtily indicates the proper entrance. "Oh. bother," he says,
and <lo\vn he trots again, and up the other flight. "I shall not
bo a minute." he remarks over his shoulder, "you can wait for

B and this is Mr. S." The porter bowed and said 'he was de
lighted. "I want you to comp with us to the postoffice," I ex
plained, "and identify us." .
They asked him how long he had known us. He threw up his
hands with an eloquent gesture; memory refused to travel- back
such distance. It appeared there was never a time when he' had
not known us. We had been boys together. Did he know any
body else who knew us? The. question appeared to him almost
insulting. Everybody in Innsbruck knew us, honored us, respected
usâ everybody, that is, except a few postoffice officials, people
quite out of society. Would he kindly bring along, say one
undoubtedly respectable citizen who could vouch for our identity.
The request caused him to forget us and our troubles. The argu
ment became a personal quarrel between the porter and the clerk.
If he, the porter, was not a respectable citizen of Innsbruck,
where was such tojae found? Both gentlemen became excited,
and the discussion passed beyond my understanding. But I gath
ered dimly, from what the clerk said, that ill-natured remarks
relative to the porter's grandfather and a missing cow had never
yet been satisfactorily replied to; and from observations made by
the porter, that stories were in circulation about the clerk's aunt
and a sergeant of artillery that should suggest to a discreet
nephew of the lady the inadvisability of talking about other peo
ple's grandfathers. Our sympathies were naturally with the
porter ; he was our man, but he did not seem to be advancing
our cause, much. We left them quarreling and persuaded the
head waiter that evening, to turn out the gas at our end of table
d'hote. The next morning we returned to the postoffice by our
selves. The clerk proved a reasonable man when treated in a
friendly spirit. He was a bit of a climber himself. He admitted
the possibility of our being the rightful owners. His instructions
were only not to deliver up the bags, and he, himself, suggested a
way out of the difficulty. We might come each day and dress in
the i- ;~<toffice. behind the screen. It was an awkward arrange
ment, even although the clerk allowed us the use. of the tack
door. . And occasionally, in spite of Â«the utmost care, bits of us
would show outside the screen. But for a couple of days, until the
British Consul returned from Salzburg, the postoffice had to be
our. dressing-room. The continental official, I am inclined to
think, errs on the side of prudence.As I have intimated, many men have sought my acquaintance at the
hotelâ rather too many. It is a matter of pride, to be sure, that I, a
stranger, should be sought so extensively. Also it is a fact to which I
feel at liberty to advert that seldom have I met men in the lobbies of any
hotel who failed to express a pleasant appreciation of my merits. But an
unfortunate characteristic about every man and woman. who has called on
me is that he or she suffers. from temporary financial embarrassment. I
hope I am too just and' considerate of my fellow man's^burdens to refuse
to relieve distress when it is revealed to me, but while, the demand; for
money increases alarmingly, the return of loans remains non inventus.
have out of the whole shooting match. How do you manage it, old girl.'
I'm blanked if I can make it out.' "
I politely expressed myself as unable as was the late lamented Jack
Lacquerre to see how it could be done, and the lady replied to my in
quiries: "Well, as a sample of a hundred little fool tricks I cured Jack
of, I pointed out to him that there were no rules in the game which re
quired him to send half a dozen bunches of American Beauties, at five
per, to half a dozen friends' wives every time he passed a flower shop. I
earned the reputation of being the best dressed woman in New York from
what I saved out of Jack's income by shutting off a little bunch of tricks
like that from Jack's list of bad habits. I admit that every^w6ihan can't
be as lucky as I was in my marriage â nor can every man be as lucky as
was my husband. Still, I stick to the proposition that for a man who
becomes properly house broken and submits to a wife's reasonable steer
ing it's cheaper to be married than' single."
"Then madam," I said, grasping at the moral of her preachment, "you
advise me to get married."
"No, I'll be hanged if I do, Reuben," she replied. "I only say that if
you can't keep out of the clutches of chevaliers d'industrie you should
marry a woman who will shoo them away from you. You've a corking
big income, which is now largely going to the support of gentlemen who
live by their wits."
I could only laugh at this frankness, for from her it is an amuse
ment. And, of course, I could but smile at her implication that I could
ever be caught by the devices of another chevalier d'industrie. I told her
that to avoid even the contact of such persons I intended to move into
apartments and set up a modest establishment of my own. She inquired if
I had yet selected apartments, and when I had assured her that .1 was
still undecided, she frankly told me that I would do well to leave the
matter to her, and probably thereby save myself trouble. This was
rather more patronage than I was prepared to endure, so I informed her
that I felt competent to rent a home for myself, and departed to go
about that very business. â¢
I smiled indulgently at her delusion that I could again be the dupe of
a rogue and begged her to proceed with her remarks until I should sec
the loric â if there were any â of her contention that a man could' live mar
ried on less than he needed to remain single.
"Oh," replied she merrily, 'if we are to hold fast to logic I insist that
my premises be not perverted. I did not say that a man could live mar
ried on less than he needed as a bachelor, but on less than he sometimes
spends as a bachelor. You do not need half, not a quarter, of what you
spend. The balance a clever wife would save for you â to spend on her
self. Many a woman lives well in our society on what she saves from the
income of a man who before she married him was always in debt with the
same income. A clever wife would save you from being bunkoed" â a lo
calism for cheated â "would see that you were properly dressed â I note
that you are improving in that respect â would discourage you from play
ing faro, the races, Wall street or any other sure thing game, and would
give you a home where the cooking and service would equal your club's."
"And are these the things which constitute a wife's duty in our society,
dear madam?" I inquired in amazement.
"They constitute a wifely duty which only the clever woman can per
form; and a wife who is up to the game to that extent is entitled to the
use of all of her husband's income not required for .his moderate living
expenses. The ideal wife in our set is the one who keeps her husband
comfortably housed, fashionably dressed, and entertained at home by the
kind of society he enjoys â not the kind she wants him to enjoy. To do
that is not so much a matter of expense as brainy management. Such
women are never in the divorce courts, nor alon,e in an opera box with
'a friend of the family*; yet such live a life of almost as complete inde
pendence as if they were not hampered by a husband. They entertain in
their own way â as well as in the way their husbands may like â dress as
they wish, travel when and where they are a mind to, with hubby always
along. If you were married to such a woman you would be amazed at
how small an allowance you could get along with. My dear old Jack used
to say to me, 'Polly,' he'd say, 'p'chee, you spend about nine-tenths of my
income, but I have more comfort out of the other tenth than I used to
DEAR UNCLE SILAS â I have, your 'communication in' which
you remind me â not as my uncle, but as my banker â that 1
have been drawing with inconsiderate prodigality on my bank
balance lately. As my uncle you kindly advise me not to "stint,
myself in those forms of modish entertainments to which I,
as a young gentleman of wealth and family, should accustom myself,
while, as a banker you offer to my consideration the indubitable truth
that even a balance beyond the fancy of fiction is capable of exhaustion.
I confided the tenor of your observations to Mrs. Lacquerre, who in
spires me with that kind of confidence which leads me to seek her advice
and sj-mpathetic understanding in my worldly affairs. After hearing what
you said about incomes she remarked that in the case of mine there .seem
ed no safety but in marriage.
"But, Lord save us!" she added, with that whimsical emphasis, to
which I find it difficult to accustom myself in a woman of her station.
"But, Lord save us, Reuben, I'm not so cinchy sure the remedy I suggest
isn't worse than the disease! There are worse things in life than being
broke, and being married to the wrong gal is one of them. Some men
find it more expensive to support a family than to live en garcon, but
you are not one of those men. It would be an economy for you to mar
ry. You are now the victim of every confidence man who has the wit or
luck to keep in the fringe of society, and my, my, what a lot of them there
are!" . .
In looking through a list of apartments proffered in reply to an ad-
Tertisement I found one peculiarly suited to my wants, the more so as the
furniture of the apartment was - offered for sale. The â¢ gentleman, a Mr.
.Van Alpine, who made the offer, called on me in response to my request,
arid explained the circumstances which forced him to dispose of the fur
nishings of his apartment, as well as to offer the favorable lease he held.
It was simply that his business compelled him, unexpectelly, . to reside in
Boston, and he remarked that "a moving is as bad as a fire," so he had
decided to tell.
I went to his apartment with him and found that he had in no degree
exaggerated the extent and elegance of the furnishing and decorations.
I. have seen enough of undoubted elegance at the homes Aunt Sarah's and
Mrs. Lacquerre's kindness have, opened to me to know that here was a
collection of great merit and richness. When we had examined the rooms
and their belongings the gentleman offered me refreshments, stating that
he had dismissed his servants, being on the very eve of departure, so he
would have to serve me after his own fashion. It was a pretty fashion,
though, for he soon had a table spread with delectable sandwiches, choice
fruit and a bottle of vintage champagne; placing 5 these before me in a man
ner so deft and neat that it added to my appetite.
When we had partaken of the repast I asked Mr. Van Alpine at what
he valued the furnishings as they stood. He replied with a slightly wry
face that he had no trouble in giving me exact figures of the cost, as he
had but lately paid the bills. They amounted, in fact, to a little more than
$10,000. "But, Mr. Larkmead," he added, "I a*m a man who takes his
medicine, as the saying is, and I know that a forced sale makes a pretty
purchase. Say $5000 cash and I'll pocket the loss and sign the bill over
another bottle." .'
I was too sharp to bite at this attractive bait, and I shrewdly replied:
"Say $2500 and the check is yours." â¢ .
He smiled politely as he replied: "I am obliged to you for looking
over my belongings, but if that is all you will pay for them the interview
need not be prolonged."
"Good day, Mr. Van Alpine," I said, rising to depart, but he motioned
me to be seated and remained for some minutes in deep conjecture.
Then he said impulsively: "Sir, I am no salesman and cannot boggle for
a bargain. My immediate concern is to have this business at an end.
Therefore, sir, the goods are yours for the check."
I wrote the check with a trembling hand, fearing a change of mind on
his part, but he accepted it as if glad that the business were off his mind.
We left the house together, he to close his affairs down town, I to order
my trunks packed and â¢ write you the news of my good fortune. I will
report later on how I enjoy my home.
Later â Alas, Uncle Silas! the schemes of the wicked are devious and
deep. My pride has received a hurt which I confess with mortification.
But confess I must, and, as I do all things, in an orderly manner.
Having seen to the packing of my belongings at the hotel, and taking
a little satchel containing my jewelry and trinkets in my hand, I proceed
ed to my new apartments. I entered by the key Mr. Van Alpine gave
me, and making a more leisurely survey of the premises, found a number
of art treasures which delighted me by their richness. I found, too, that
a set of oak book shelves were wisely stored, and taking a favorite vol
ume of history, I seated myself to pass the time profitably pending the
arrival of my trunks. My excitement over my favoring fortune and the
exciting nature 'of the chapter I was reading, "Angels' Traces in Aryan
Sources," combined to produce a' thirst which reminded me of the conveni
ent wine closet, and soon I was seated before a blazing gas log, a bottle
open by my side, smokins: an excellent cigar and delightfully absorbed in
my engaging chapter. Thus disposed, I was surprised suddenly to find a
stranger near me and was pained to note that he was in imminent danger
of a stroke of apoplexy. ,
"Sir," I said, "although you have entered my apartment uninvited,
your distress appeals acutely to my sympathy. I beg of you to be seated
until you have averted by rest a shock which seems likely to end your life
unless precautions are taken."
The intruder, an elderly gentleman, had the appearance of having just
left a train, was stout, well dressed, a familiar type, in short, of a pros
perous New Yorker of leisure. In response to my polite speech* he tried
to speak, but only sputtered, or at best emitted inarticulate gurgles. "Be
seated," I urged. "Be seated and partake of a glass of this excellent wine."
By a supreme effort he succeeded in exclaiming, "Who the devil are
you and what the devil are you doing in rriy apartment?"
Deciding that he was some mildly insane person I said reassuringly,
"I beg of you to be calm and tell me where you live that I may send
for your friends."
The gentleman rang an electric bell and then sank into a chair. To a
uniformed attendant, who quickly responded to the bell, he said, "Now,
who in thunder is this person and how in thunder did he get in here?"
."He's the clock mender, sir. Your valet brought him here and said
that he was to return with his tools and mend some clocks. So when he
returned we supposed it was all right."
"My vaiet, Barker!" exclaimed the gentleman, and then went into gales
of laughter, from which unseemly mirth I feared he would not emerge
alive. But he quieted enough to say, as he wiped his eyes, "Oh, Barker!
Oh, my Lord, Oh, that precious rascal. Oh, Barker, the villainl Has
he done you, my good man? Tell me the story."
Not relishing being called "my good man," I replied with dignity and
briefly told how I came into possession of the rooms.
I will not prolong the painful truths as they slowly revolved during
the next few hours, while we were in communication with the superin
tendent of the house and the police. Briefly, rather let me explain. The
gentleman was the real -Mr. Van Alpine and the unwhipped rascal from
whom I supposed I was buying the furniture was a discharged valet named
Barker. Mr. Van Alpine had been warned by the police of .Barker's char
acter only a few hours before he (Mr. Van Alpine) left town, and he over
looked telling the superintendent of the apartment-house anything about
the matter. Therefore Barker had been at liberty to come and go as if he
were still employed by Mr. Van Alpine. He had taken me there under
the pretense that I was a clock mender, and when we left -the house had
quietly spoken to the superintendent, saying that I would return with a kit
of tools and repair the clocks. I' had chanced to- mention to the con
scienceless villain my plan of returning with a handbag of jewelry, and he
had quickly taken advantage of the information to provide against my be
ing refused admittance. The police informed me that Barker was a quick
moving fellow, and so we learned when the bank reported that the check
had been cashed within an hour of my drawing it. When the real Mr. Van
Alpine heard my name he asked me if I chanced to be related to Si Lark
mead, and when I informed him that you were my uncle he looked at me
in astonishment and muttered over and over, "A nephew of sly old Si, and
such an easy mark!" I do not know what he meant, but report His
words for your information.
I have told Mrs. Lacquerre of my latest experience, and she insists
that she will personally install me in apartments and supply me with a
valet who will prevent me from being kidnaped. She will have her little
joke, you see. Me kidnaped! Wearily, REUBEN.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALIl '
7
ADVENTURES OF REUBENno_text(T|HE Russo-Japanese war has
I raised many a perplexing question
1 as to. the spelling of proper names.
JL The different spelling of the name
of the same place in newspapers and
magazines is confusing and has created
a demand for some reasonably definite
authority, says the. Philadelphia
Ledger.
In a manner eo quiet that very few
persons have ever heard of it. Uncle
Sam has been conducting a small but
very select Bpelling school for 'some
time, and has issued several install
ments of a new^spelllng book that will
greatly disturb teachers, scholars, map
makers and a host of other people .who
would ordinarily be champions in any
spelling bee.
The prime object is to secure unlr
forrnity in the spelling of geographical
names in all Government, publications.
A board sitting In Washington takes up
all place names of niore than one form
that may be submitted to it, applies to
them a code of rules formulated for the
purpose and then votes on the forms
suggested by the members. -The form
receiving a majority vote becomes the
official one. and under the act of Con^
gress creating the board will hereafter
be used in all Government publications/
including maps.
The forms AUegany, Alleghany and
Allegheny applied to five counties, a
large city, a river, a mountain range
and many smaller places, have long
puzzled good spellers. Uncle Sam now
spells the river and mountain Alle
gheny, and. leaves the forms' of other
places undisturbed. Chinese and other
Oriental place names heretofore com
pounded are spelled as one word, viz:
Hoangho (river. China), not- Hoang-
Ho; Llaotung (peninsula), not Liao-
Tung; Niuchwang (treaty port), not
New-Chwang. In British Indian ter
minology "pur" has taken the place of
"poor" and pore," viz: Cawnpur, not
Cawnpoor or Cawnpore. . Â¦ Russian
names in Alaska - terminating 1 in the
equixalent of of, off, ow or ov are gvl
en the form of, viz: Baranof, Pribilof
(not Prybiloff).
The island of Puerto Rico (rich
port)- had its American "name fixed as
Porto Rico by Â«.ct of Congress (April
13. -1900).- The old terror.:Apalachi
cola has been relieved of some of its
power to embarrass by having one '"p"
cut out, as here given. According to
the rule, the "h" in Pittsburgh should
be omitted; but the people of that
city are very tenacious of that letter.
as.it appears 'in the city.'n charter.

The Manor, July 5.
If you really care to come, Geoff.
you will find me by the gardtn fat*.
waiting for you. Tonra, M.
It brought back all the Joy Â«f thai*
first days at the Manorâ those days
whose happiness I thought I had, faced
the reason for when I, asked youa
cousin Margaret to marry me..
You see I had just. begun to care Â«
little for you. Millicent, that day oa
the river when I kissed yon â and you
seemed so cold, so angry with me. (I
remember you wouldn't even speak tÂ»
me. Was it â tell me, darlingâ was It
because you cared?)
You seemed to avoid me after that
and Midget seemed to like me, and
then â it all came in a minute and I
thought I had found my heart's desire.
I had not time to understand the mis
take I had made; in fact I never un
derstood It fully until you told me yes
terday that she had run away with
Miles that morning and been married
to him at a registry! Miles! â that In
effable cud! And she actually cared
no little that sho tossed my letter over
to vou â my first love letter to herâ
and told you to read- It and answer It.
And theu she kept my next one wait
ing unanswered all thcae days and told
you to write again, temporizing and
keeping rne away until she had made
up her mind.* Good heavens! I do not
want to be harsh about her, but I can
not say I envy. Miles.
I have been reading your letters
over againâ reading between the lines
this time â and I know that the girl I
love and have loved all these three
weeks is Millicent, not Margaret.
Won't You takes me back, dear? for
I was -yours first, though I did not
know it. and you, by your own con
fession, have only guessed It.
May I not come and see you?
Let me have an answer soon. I
shall be longing for it. Your
GEOFF.
When that letter came I felt as If
I should go mad if I did net rush, to
the Manor and find out the meaning
of it. Because you see It was the
thought of losing you â the "you"
Â¦whom I had loved In your lettersâ â¢
the ideal whom I believed Z had re*
alized in your little . cousin Midget,
that distracted me so. 'And when I
met you at the garden pate and ya
said: "Oh. Geoff, try to bear It well,
dear: she has deserted you," I could
hardly .take in the meaning *t yeuc
Â¦words. .
For I -was thinking how beautiful
you looked with the divine compas
s/on in your face, no longer proud and
cold, but all aglow with feeling, and
how sweet your voice aound*<t whaa
you said my name.
Millicent: I may call you Mllllcent,
may I- not? â can you ever forgive mÂ»
and let me some day plead my cause
with you again? What an ancel you
are! and what a fool I have been!
Geoff, dear, I am so sorry. Your
note gave me the heartache. Have
you really been worried? I wish t
had written, but I thought perhaps it
was better not. It 13 no use trying to
save people a little pain in the present
if it is going to make It v/orse tor
them later, is it? Don't come over to
the Manor: wait a little. You would
be welcome to one person, who calls
herself "M." but sÂ»he Li not everybody.
And don't be hurt. Geoff: I think you
had better wait until you hear again.
You see (I hardly know how to ex
plain it to you) sometimes people say
"Yes" in a hurry and mean it for a
moment, then afterward rind that
they ought to have said "No." And
when that happens the best thing 13
to say as little as possible. Your lit
tle Midget is not quite what you think
her. You must forgive her if sho
made a mistake, because, you see,
she's only a girl and she did not mean
any harm; it was just thoughtlessness.
Sherwill write to you by to-raorrow'a
post more fully. Your sorrowful M.
I Aldershot, July 4.
Five whole days, iiidget. and no let
ter from you! What does it mean?
Every time the post comes in my heart
jumps and then it sinks, for there is
not a word from you. darling. I did
not know how much I cared until now.
I think it was your letter that showed
me. The girl who conld write like that
is worth loving, I said to myself. And
then, you cruel little child, you leave
me without a lineâ starving on silence.
Is it only that you are busy at play or
has anything happened?
Let me know by return for T am very
anxious. Yours, GEOFF.
Ths Manor. July 3.
By the bve it was with her I quar
reled at croquet, surely â not with you.
darlingâ and you never to!d me the red
ro3es I got you were your favorites!
What a lucky guess on my part! It
wasn't quite a guesÂ«i either, because I
remember I took a lot of trouble over
those roses. I asked your cousin what
you were going to wear and what flow
ers she thought would go best with it.
She knew, of course, and I owe her a
good turn for- telling me.
I miss you more and more every
moment and think I shall get a night'3
l*>ave next weekend and run over to the
Manor. Would I be welcome If I did?.
Tell me, sweetheart. Your GEOFF.
Aldershot. July 2.
So Miles la still hanging about and
giving his opinion unasked, is he? If
any one is going to be jealous, it
strikes me there's more cause in this
direction. Why. you foolish little
Midget, your cousin has the greatest
disdain for me. We gut on very well at
first, but â well, it was my fault I sup
pose â I offended hpr one day and â and
that's enough about her. Won't she
really coir.e over with you to the re
view? It's rather unkind of her, isn't
It? After all. I'm going to be her

Shirt Waists All Whiter. â¢ .
The bargain counters are heaped
with handsome things in shirt waists,
but one cannot expect to get these
waists given away.
"I am buying linen shirt' waists to
wear all winter," said one woman to a
party of shoppers who stood gazing
into the alluring windows of a hand
some shop, "and I 'am selecting them
as carefully as though they were sum
mer waists."
"I am choosing." she continued,
"the heavy hand embroidered linen
waists because they' wear the best and
the longest and look ; the richest.
There are handsome white linen
waists embroidered- with English eye
let hand work. Â¦ They sell for } 3 and
upward, but they are weir worth the
money." -.
A great many women will wear the
wash shirt waists all winter and that
is one reason why .the prices hold so
well. Still, in the thinner waists, one
can always get bargains in the fall.

snow nies the rougn goods win come
out, and one will wonder where so
many and such handspme rough suits
suddenly came from.
The attractive qualities of the new
coats are Just realized by the great
army of women who want to be hand
some. When you have been either too
thin or too thick for years and sud
denly see a way out . of " it, then the
saving grace of these long coats is
brought home to you.
The woman who is a little too thick
can put on a three-quarter cloak of silk
pongee or of very light weight cloth
and look as though Bhe were a very
miracle of beauty. And the woman
tvho is too thin can gain a great deal
by dressing herself in one of these gar-
it can be worn ail the year round,' Just
as you make your all-the-year hat3
and your all-the-year gowns.
. The bargain counters offer -very
â¢handsome short lengths in cloth, and
this- brings one to a discussion of the
suits that are going Xp be worn. Whole
suits all of one material will not be
more popular than the mixed suits.
The wife of a famous steel magnate
has just ordered a full suit of navy
blue cloth. It consists only of a skirt
and a.' pretty â¢Â» white shirt waist. With
this she will wear a natty tan Jacket.
The little tan covert cloth will be
worn more than ever this fall, and par
. ticular attention will be paid to its
lines, which will be straight in front
with the back and the sides tight fit
ting. Big, white pearl buttons are hand
some with such a coat and, though
there are .many buttons on the mar
ket, none holds its own better than
these pearl buttons, which now come
with a peculiar luster. ___^
â¢ Remnant Ideas for Fall.
The navy blue cashmere fall suit
will be quite conspicuous the first days
of fall. And to get a good remnant of
cashmere should be one of the aims
of the woman who wants to -dress
smartly. The best of the new cash
meres now show quite a gloss and the
fashionable color is the old-fashioned
navy blue, the blue which holds its
own through all seasons.
The little tan coat is very smart with
this suit, but the smartest of all coats
is the little white cloth coat. This is
to be seen a great deal this fall, short
to the hips, snug, English in "its lines
and very chic.
There come lovely little white cloth
coats, the shade being not pure white,
but oyster white or mushroom white,
or one of the whitish colors. The pure
pearl white is not nearly as fashionable
as the "slight coffee tones, the ones that
are off the white.
It is to be a great season for the
economical woman, for she can buy
remnants and combine parts of her old
suits until she has a new suit smart
"and becoming. A suit of brown, one of
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL
the old summer suits, can be brought
up to date by a -little tight fitting
English coat of tan cloth or by a little
black coat elaborately faced with bands
of embroidered white satin. They trim

is asked for them, for they prove a
good investment. They wear beauti

embroidered ( in the middle of each

With this gown the woman of
fashion wore a big, flat hat with sailor
'like proclivities, draped with a white

over the side of the hat. The green

Etamlne, voile and canvas are to be
worn all winter and there are suits that
are being made up fresh in these goods,
for the material is treated "in such .a
manner that it is as warm as serge.
Besides this there are the long "cloaks
and, as a woman remarked, as she
tried on a broadcloth cloak of three
quarter length: "I can wear my voile
gown all winter under this cloak." And
the modistes are actually counting
upon this to the exclusion of the .hith

day wear.
For Cold -Day Wear.
The semi-long cloaks are made oC
many varieties -of materialâ Indeed,
nearly everything is impressed into the
service from the heaviest, broadcloth
and the shaggiest of men's suitings to
the light, smooth * shantung and Chi

over a golfing jacket. It is a fad to
make your three-quarter cloak so that
The backs of nearly all cloaks . are
tight fitting, which, gives them their
style, and the little military- trimming
at the back of .the waist is. very no
ticeable. Â¦ There are postilion effects
in the shape of little- tabs and but
tons, and there are strappings with
small tailored buttons finishing them.
The tailored buttons are very dis
tinctive this year. They are made of
gun metal, gold, brass and silver, or
they are of some mixed substance
which glitters and looks like steel, but
does not corrode so easily. The tailor
ed buttons are so called because of
their, neat metallic finish, different en
tirely from the silk worked buttons
and the covered button mold.

mushroom white cloth was trimmed
with a military finish of brown taffeta

style. Big brown enamel buttons werÂ»

Very pretty are the military touches
which are lent to the new long coats.
They are made with button holes and

Shopping the other day with Lady

chiffon broadcloth for a kilted skirt,
which is to be made with the kilts
stitched flat at the belt and over the

baggy over the wrist and the back is
laid in little tight plaits.

perhaps, a medallion or two of lace

Bargain days in the shops mean a
great deal for the woman who is fond
of lace. Mrs. Potter Palmer, who Is
one of the best lace judges in the
world, declares that never was lace so
cheap and never were bo many bar
gains to be found.
"The renaissance of lace," she said
to a friend, "has led to the resurrection
of many old pieces which were laid
away and practically lost. But the old
lace-makers of Italy and France have
discovered the value of these odd
lengths and are bringing them out
from their hiding places of half a cen

How to Make Your Gowns.
It Is difficult to mention all the bar
gains that are now offered in the shops,
fqr the summer season is practically
over and everything that was not sold
out is now being offered at a very great
sacrifice. Now is the time when a
woman with a little money can make a
wonderful showing for next season.
And it is not necessary to put away
your purchases, for, if carefully chosen,
they are of such a nature that they
can be worn this fall and winter. Beau

stockings, to the woman who does not
wear heavy hose in winter, will go
beautifully with the tailored gown of

colored stocking, or to the stocking
that is worked in colors, and a woman
who wants to be fashionable should
provide herself with all colors. â¢ .
Very pretty little taffeta suits are
now being sold very low. While these
are not intended for winter wear, still
there is something about ' Bilk that

nice lace over a cheaper grade.
And while out on the bargain hunt
don't neglect to look for bits of any
thing that will make over into deep lace
cuffs. One woman purchased enough
piece lace for a pair of these cuffs. For
a pattern she used a deep cloth cuff
pattern, lengthening it a little.
These cuffs can be stiffened and ap
plied to the gown separately so as to be
removable or they can be made Into

worked, they can show the lace pat

and beautiful. They sometimes line
these cuffs with a contrasting, color,
but the very newest are lined with
white, as the white lining makes the
lace look richer.

BARGAIN HUNT WITH THE QUEEN OF ENGLANDUnfortunately the "wear and tear of
life" â to quc-te the patent medicine ad
vertisements â wreaks natural havoc on
the physical composition of the unfor
tunate gentleman who is perhaps set
down to review twenty novels in one
column of print for the trifling sum of
a guinea. All sorts of difficulties beset
him. For instance, he may be employ
ed on a certain "literary" paper which.
being the property of the relatives of
a novelist, exists chiefly to praise that
novelist, even though It be curiously
called an "organ of English literature"
â and woe betide the miserable man
who dares to praise any one else.

the literary "grind." I tender my salu
tations to all reviewers of books, to
gether with my respectful sympathy. I
am truly sorry for them and I do not In
the least wonder that they hate with a
deadly hatred every scribbling creature
who writes & "long" novel. Because
the "pay" for reviewing such a book i3
never In proportion to its length, as of
course it ought to be. But anyway it
doesn't matter how much or how little
if it is criticized. The bulk of thÂ» pub
lic do nc-t read reviews. That isÂ» left
to the "discriminating few." And oh.
how that "discriminating few" would
love to "capture the fancy of the
masses" if they could only manage to
do it! Yet â "never mind!" they say.
with the tragedian's glare and scowl â
"our names -will be inscribed up_on the
scroll of fame when all ye are forgot
ten!" Dear things! Heaven grant
them this poor comfort in their graves.
One cannot but regret that in these
days of wonderful research, discovery
and Invention, so little is done to pop
ularize science in the columns of the
dally press. The majority of the public
are appallingly ignorant of astron
omy for instance. Would it not be as
interesting to instruct them in a simple?
and easy style as to the actual won
ders of the heavens about U3. as to
fill their minds with the details of a
murder? I hardly like to touch on the
subject of geography, for out of fifteen
"educated" person3 I asked the ques
tion recently, not one knew the actual
situation on the map of Tibet. Now it
seems to me that the press could work
wonders In the way of education â mucli
more than the "bill" will ever do.
Books on science and learning are
often sadly dull and generally expen
sive â the public cannot afford to buy
them largely, nor do they* ask for them
much at the libraries. If the daily
journals made It a rule to give bright
picturesque articles on some grand old
truths of science or some great new
discoveries, such a course of procedure
would be far more productive of good
than any amount of "short sermons"
such as we have lately heard discussed
In various quarters. For the.press Is
really a greater educational force than
the pulpit. In its hands it has the so
cial molding of a people â the digmity
of a nation as represented to other na
tions. There could hardly be a nobler
task â there can certainly never be a
higher responsibility.
May it not with due respect be sug
gested to those who have the handling
of such matters that neither the
avowed friends nor the avowed foes of
authors be permitted to review their
books â the same rule of criticism to
apply equally to the works of rausi
clans, painters, sculptors and play
wrights?. Neither personal prejudice
nor personal favoritism should be al
lowed to interfere wlth"the impression
produced on the mind by a work of. art.
Vulgar abuse and fervid eulogy are
alike out of place. In the productions
of the human brain nothing is wholly
bad and nothing is wholly good. Per
fection is impossible of attainment on
our present plane of existence. We do
not find it in nature, still less shall we
find it in ourselves. The critic can show
good in everything if he himself is of a
good mind. Or he can show bad in
everything as easily, should- his diges
tion be out of order.

be any â¢lively" reading in the sorrowful
details of sickness, crime or mania
leaves much room for doubt. And when
it Is remembered how powerfully the
human mind is affected by suggestion,
it is surely worth while inquiring as tu
whether the newspapers could not
manage to offer their readers noble
and instructive subjects of thought,
rather than morbid and degraded ones.
Fortunately for all classes, the bulk of
what may be called "magazine litera
ture" makes distinctly for the instruc-,
tion and enlightenment of the public,
and though a "gutter press" exists in
Great Britain, as in America, the pub
lic Is now educated enough to recog
nize Its type and to treat it with the
contempt it merits. I quote here part
of a letter which appeared some time
ago in the Westminster Gazette, signed
"Observer" and entitled:
"A PRESS-GOVERNED EMPIRE."
'To the Editor of the Westminster
Gazette â Sir: We have it on the
highest authority that the Government
acts on the same information as is
at the disposal of "the man In the
street' (vide Mr. Balfour at Manches
ter). The man in the street obvious
ly must depend on the press for his
information. How has the press
served him?
"Let me take a recent illustration.
A great experiment was to be made
by the navy. A battleship with all
its tremendous armament was to
pound a battleship. Naturally the
press was well represented, and the
public was eager for its report.
"In due course a narrative appeared
describing the terrible havoc wrought.
The greatest stress was laid upon the
instant ignition and complete de
struction by fire of all the woodwork
on the doomed ship. Elaborate lead
ing articles appeared enforcing the
lesson that wood was no longer a pos
sible material for the accessory fur
niture of a battleship.
"A day or two after a quiet answer
in the House of Commons from Mr.
Goshen informed the limited public
who read it that no fire whatever had
occurred on the occasion so graph
ically described by the best of press
correspondents.
"The events dealt with on these oc
casions took place . in our own coun-
try. under our own eyes, so to speak.
If such untrue reports are set forth
with the verisimilitude of accurate
and detailed personal description of
eye-witnesses, what are we to say of
the truth of events occurring at a dis
tance? ..:; , k i
"Special knowledge, special expe
rience long-continued, speaking under
a sense of responsibility, are set at
naught. The regular channels of in
formation are neglected and the con
duct of affairs is based on newspaper
reports. Any private business con
ducted and managed on these lines
would be immediately ruined. The
business of the empire is more impor
tant, and the results of its mismanage
ment are more serious. For how long
will it be possible to continue its man
agement, trusting to the light thrown
on events by an irresponsible pteÂ»s?"
The "irresponsibility" here complain
ed of comes out perhaps more often
and most glaringly in those papers
which profess to chronicle the sayings
and doings of Kings and Queens, Prime
Ministers and personages more or less
well known in the world of art, letters
and society. In nine cases out of ten
the. journalist who reports these say-,
ings and doings has never set eyes on
the people about whom he writes with
such a free and easy flippancy. Even
if he has, his authority to make their
conversation public may be questioned.
It is surely not too much to ask of the
editors of newspapers that they should,
by applying directly to the individuals
concerned, ascertain whether such and
such a statement made to them Is true
before giving It currency. A couple of
penny stamps expended In private cor
respondence would settle the matter to
the satisfaction of both parties. .
"Personalities," however, would seem
to be greatly in vogue. Note the fol
lowing:
"At seven o'clock the King left the
hotel and walked to the spring to drink
more of the water. . Altogether, his
Majesty has to- drink about a quart of
the water every morning before break
fast.
"Standing among the throng, in
which every type and nationality of
humanity was represented, the King
Eipped his second pint glass. of water.
"After drinking the quart of water,
One may query whether "the snob
bish curiosity of the crowd" or the
snobbish newspaper information as to
how "the King sipped his second pint
glass of water." was the most repre-
Jiensible. Of coarse there are Soth men
and women who delight in the person
alities of the press, especially when
they conpern themselves. Sir Gilbert
Parker, for instance, would have been
justly annoyed had the "fashionable
news column"- failed to Insert an an
nouncement that he had followed the
Kingâ (with that "snobbish" crowd, one
supposes?)â to Marienbad.Many ladies
of rank and title are only too happy to
ha\-e their dresses described to the man
in the street, and their physical charms
discussed by Tom, Dick and Harry.
And when the press is amiable enough
to oblige them in these little yearnings
for personal publicity, let us hope that
thp laborer, being worthy of his hire,
hath -his reward.
In olden days it would seem that a
great part of the responsibility of the
press lay in its criticism of art and
literature. That burden, however, no
longer lies upon its shoulders. Since
the people began to read for them
selves, newspaper criticism, so far as
books are concerned, carries little
weight. When some particular book
secures a great success, we read this
kind of thing about it: "In argument,
intrigue and style it captures the fancy
of the masses without attracting the
slightest attention from the critical
and discriminating few whose ap
proval alone gives any chance of per
manence to work." This is, of
course, very old hearing. "Ths criti
cal and discriminating few" in Italy
long ago condemned Dante as a "vul
gar" rhymer, who used the "people's
vernacular." Now, the much-abused
Florentine is the great Italian classic.
The same critical and discriminating
few condemned John Keats, who is
now enrolled among the chlefest of
English poets. Onslaughts of the bit
terest kind were hurled at the novels
of Charles Dickens by the "critical
and discriminating few" â in the great
writer's time â but he "captured the
fancy of the masses" and lives in the
hearts and â¢ homes of thousands for
whom the critical and discriminating
few might just as well never have
existed. And when you look up the
names of the "critical and discrimi
nating few" In our own day, we find,
strange to say, that they are all dis
appointed authots! All of them have
written poems dr novels, which are
failures. So we must needs pity their
"criticism" and/ "/liscrimination"
equally, knowing the secret fount "of
gall for which both these delicate
emotions spring. At the same time
the "responsibility" of the press might
still be appealed to in literary, dra
matic and artistic matters, as for ex
ample:
Why allow an unsuccessful artist to
criticize a successful picture?
-Why ask an unlucky playwright,
who cannot get even a farce accepted
by the managers, to criticize a bril
liant play? â¢
Why depute a gentleman or lady
who has "essayed"'' a little unsuccess
ful fiction to "reWew" a novel which
has "captured the fancy of the
masses" and 13 selling well?
These be weighty matters. Common
human nature is common human na
ture all the world over, and it is not In
common human nature to give praise
to another for what we ourselves envy.
Every one has not the same fine en
dowment of generosity as Sir "Walter
Scott, who wrote an anonymous review
of Lord Byron's poems, giving them
the most enthusiastic praise and-frank
ly stating that after the appearance of
"This" his Majesty performed by pac
ing up and down the promenade from
the Kruez spring at one* end to the
Ferdinand spring at the other.
"Notwithstanding all the appeals of
the local authorities to the visitors.
King Edward was much greatly in

food.
True it is that the Times still holds
its own as a journal where one may
look in vain for sensationalism (save in
its advertisements of the Encyclopedia
Britannica), but its position is rather
like that of a grim old lion surrounded
by cubs of all sizes and ages tMat yap

erties with its tail. It can be said, how
ever, that all the better, higher class

around them precisely in the same way
---"circulation five times as large that
of any penny morning Journal," etc.
And the question of the circulation of
any particular newspaper resolves itself
Into two pointsâ firstly, the amount of
money it puts Into the pockets of its
proprietors or proprietor, and, secondly,
the Influence it has or is likely to have
on the manners and morals of the pub
lic. The last Is by far the most im
portant matter, though the first is nat
urally the leading motif of Its publica
tion. Herein we touch the keynote of
responsibility. How and In what way
are the majority of people swayed or
affected by the statements and opinions
of some one man or several men em
ployed on the world's press? On this
point It may perhaps be asked whether
any newspaper is really justified in set
ting before readers of all ages and tem
peraments a daily fare of suicides, mur
ders, divorce cases, sudden deaths or
abnormal "horrors" of every kind to
startle, depress or warp the mind away
from a sane and healthful outlook upon
life and the things if life in general?
A very brilliant and able journalist
tells me that "if we don't put these
things In we are so deadly dull!" One
can but smile at this candid statement
of Inefficiency. The idea that there can

isting in the world as an aid. to civil
isation and human fraternity than the
press if its vast powers were employed
to the noblest purposes. It ought to
rtsemble a mighty ship, which, with
brave, .true men at the helm, moves
ever on a straight course, cleaving the
voters of darkness* and error, and
making direct for the highest shores
of peace and promise. But it must be
a ship indeed, grandly built, nobly
manned and steadily steeredâ not a
craty, water logged vessel, creaking
with the thud of every wave, or bob
bing backward and forward' uncertain
ly in a gale. Its position at the pres
ent day is, or appears to be. rather the
latter than the former. Unquestion
ably the people, taken in the mass,
do not rely upon it. They read the
newspapers,â unfortunately, they often
iead the worst kind of .newspapers â
but they almost immediately forget
everything in them except the head
lines and one or two unpleasant police
cases. And why do they forget? Sim
ply because first of all they are not
sufficiently interested, and secondly, be
cause they do not believe the news they
read. A workingman told me the other
day that he had been saving sixpence
a week on two halfpenny papers which
he had been accustomed to take in for
the past year. "I found 'em out in
ten lives all on too of ane another in
two weeks." he candidly explained â
"and so I thought' I might as well keep
my money for something more useful.
So I started putting the halfpence by
tor -my little kiddie and I'm going to
stick to it. There's five shillings in the
savings bank already!"
Glancing back to the early journal
ism of the "past century.^vhen Dickens
and Thackeray wrote for the news
papers ("there were giants' in these
days") one cannot help being struck by
the great deterioration in the whole
"tone" of the press at the present time
as contrasted with that which prevailed
in the dawn of the Victorian era. There
is dignity, refinement and power in the
leading articles of the Times and other
journals then in vogue, such as must
needs have compelled people not only
to read, but to think. The vulgar "per
sonal" note: the flippant sneer at this,
that or 'tother personage; the monkey
like mockery of women, the senseless
gibes flung at poets and poetry, the
clownish kick at sentimentâ were all
apparently unknown.

and admirable. It is a suvff^tiou

undreamed of- in newspaper office

journalist, is scarcely to blame if in
a praiseworthy desire to give a "sell

hr- is employed he gets up a little bit
of speculative melodrama, such as
'"German Malignity," "Russian Trick
ery." "Mysterious Movements of the
Fleet." -French Insult to the King."
"America's Secret Treaty or "Alarm

not in any way .departing- from his
own special line of business if he
counts on the general gullibility of
the public, though in this matter he
is liable to be himself gulled. For
the public have been so often taken
in by mere "sensationalism" in war
news and the like tha.t they are be
ginning to view all such rumors with
more contempt than credence. Never
theless the* ambitious little press boys

for their hot headed, impulsive and
thoughtless ways as the personages

It is quite wrong and wholly unpa

kind of petty strife one is irresistibly

very plentiful. \ â¢
In the way of introduced game there
Is abundant food for powder In New
Zealand. The sportsman will find the
forests In the North Island full of wild
pigs. Wild cattle and goats are also
numerous. The grandest sport of all
Is the chase of the acclimatized deer.
Thousands of red and fallow deer
roam the rough wooded hill country in
various parts of the colony. The red
deer carry even finer antlers than their
cousins in the highlands of Scotland
and sportsmen from the northern
hemisphere enjoy better and far
cheaper stalking here than In the "old
country." The principal red deer for
ests are the Wairarapa country (Well
ington province), some parts of Nelson
and Marl borough and around the shores
of Lakes Wanaka and Hawea (North
Otago.) Fallow deer abound In the
Maungakawa ranges and other parts
of South Auckland and in the Blue
Mountains. Otago.
The excellent deer stalking and trout
fishing, in fact, are two of the great
est attractions which the colony offers
to travelers. Originally devoid of good
fresh-water fish, the rivers and lakes
of New Zealand have everywhere been
plentifully stocked with trout (chiefly
Californian rainbow and English brown
trout). The fish grow to great size, are
immensely game and provide the ang
ler with incomparably fine sport.
âa link with the saurians of the
primeval ageâ is an Interesting denizen
of New Zealand. It is now found only
on a few rocky Islands on the North
Auckland coast, .the Bay of Plenty,
the vicinity of the East Cape and in
Cook Strait. "Among reptiles," says
a local authority on the subject, "it
occupies pretty much the same Isolated
position as the kiwi does among birds."
A curious thing about the indigen
ous fauna of New Zealand is that It
Includes no quadrupeds with the ex
ception of a small black rat, which the
natives hunted , for' food. There was
once a native dog,, but it was intro
duced by the Maori immigrants from
Polynesia. There are no wild animals
or snakes; there Is nothing to fear in
the most gloomy and solitary of the
forests.
In order to preserve the vanishing
bird life the New Zealand Government
has set aside two islands as avifauna
reserves, where the many species of
indigenous birds (some of which on the
mainland fall an easy prey to cats,
weasels and other animals introduced
by the colonists) may live and multi
ply" undisturbed. One of these islands
Is Hauturu, or Little Barrier Island, In
the Hauraki Gulf (North Island); and
the other is Resolution Island in Dusky
Sound, on the extreme southwest of
the colony. Both these places are
densely wooded, and are the happy
haunts of many varieties of native
birds. The tuneful bellbird, in partic-
THE native fauna of New Zealand
comprises some of the most Inter
esting birds in the world, notably
the flightless species â the kiwi,
kakapo and weka and the very
rare (If not extinct tahake (Notornls
mantelll). There are over 200 species
of birds in New Zealand; two In par
ticular, the bellbird and the tui, are
beautiful songsters. In ancient times
the country was inhabited by a gigan
tic ostrich-like bird called the moa,,
wingless and standing twice the height
of a man. The fossil bones .of this
great bird are still found In various
parts, especially in caves and are con
spicuous objects in the Colonial mu
seums. The modern representative of
the moa Is the kiwi (apteryx), a bird
about the size of a domestic fowl with
the mere rudiment of wings, loose floc
culent plumage with fine halr-llke fila
ments and a long sharp tapering bill.
It Is a night rover, only venturing
abroad in the darkness, and haunts the
depths of the forests, particularly In
the interior of the North Island and
the rugged only half-explored regions
of Southwest Otago, bordering the fa
mous sounds. The eggs are remark
able for their large size, sometimes
measuring five Inches In . length. In
the North Island the Maoris frequent
ly make handsome cloaks of kiwi feath
ers. The weka bird, another bird that
has lost the use of its wings, is more
when he first visited New Zealand in
1769, compared the music of the ko
rimako to that of "small bells most
exquisitely tuned." The scream of
the noisy kaka parrot is heard and
the soft "ku-ku" of the beautiful
white breasted wood pigeon, noted for
its size and the brilliancy and irides
cence of its plumage. Several kinds
of parakeets inhabit the bush and a
social, pretty little bird Is the tiny
fearless fantall. The rivers, swamps
and lakes abound in wild duck, which
afford splendid sport to the gunner.
On the coasts there are teeming mul
titudes of all kinds of sea birds, in
cluding the mutton bird (titi), a dus
ky petrel, which on some of the small
islands curiously shares' the cliffslde
burrows with the rare tuatara lizard.
The mutton bird is captured in great
numbers by the southern Maoris
every season. Its fishy flesh is a fa
vorite delicacy among the native peo
ple.
A wonderful migrant among New
Zealand birds is the kauka or godwit.
Regularly about the end of March In
each year the kaukas assemble at the
North Cape in immense flocks and take
their flight over the sea northward. It
is believed that they fly straight across
the tropics and up to Eastern Siberia,
where they breed, returning to their
southern home In October, November,
or December.
The tuatara. lizard, a most singular
survival of an ancient order of reptiles
common than the kiwi, Is not nearly
so shy of man and is often a source
of great amusement to campers-out
and bushmen.
The kakapo (Maori for "night par
rot") is found in the, deep forests of
the southwest, where he lives mostly
in holes under the spreading tree
roots and, like the kiwi, only comes out
to feed by night. Another remarkable
bird inhabiting the Alpine and sub-
Alpine regions of the South Island is
the kea parrot (Nestor notabilis).
The kea is a true mountaineer and his
querulous screams are heard hijrh on
the storm swept heights and in the
regions of perpetual snow and ice. On
the Alpine slopes where the "further
est out" flock owners pasture their
sheep the kea is tinder the ban, be
cause of ' the carnivorous tastes of
some of his kind. Keas are blamed
for sheep killing and a price is on
their heads in many of the upland
districts.
The . Interesting bird life is one of
the pleasures of a journey through
the New Zealand forest. Early in the
morning the tui-- or parson t bird (so
called from having a white tuft of
downy feathers at its throat like a
parson's band) awakens the camper
out with its beautiful bell-like. melody
which enlivens the bush throughout
the day. In the South Island the bell
bird (korimako. or. makomako) is
numerous and is an even sweeter
singer than the tui. Captain Cook,
course, you will find great difficulty in
balancing yourself at first, but this
self-same thing is over half the bat
tle and when you can hop along easily
for fifteen minutes without any fatigue
you will find that your swaying pro
pensity is disappearing and that your
waist is becoming firm and well set.
The other exercise is entirely dif
ferent. With no apparatus, stand
erect. Place one hand over your head
and take care to see that the arm is
as straight and as high up as you can
get it. Put the other arm as low down
at your side as you can get it. Raise
the low hand and lower the high one.
Naturally you will feel like swaying
your body when you do this and in-
stead of trying to hold rigid and still
sway it all you possibly can. In other
words, rock from side to side.
I'm going to tell you a secret about
this movement. Besides strengthen
ing the side muscles, you are giving
your liver such a generous shakeup
that it will wonder what on earth has
happened and it will be genuinely dis
tressed, for no bilious irregularities can
stand such treatment for long, and you
will suddenly find yourself free from
torpidity of all kinds and descriptions.
-Nor are these all the muscles that
footwork arouses to sudden and active
work.
Every step forward moves the lower
layer of abdomen muscles and the
more energetic and brisk the step, the
more they have to do. Watch the peo
ple on the streets as they pas3 you
by and see how readily you can pick
out those whose muscles are not
strong. There Is a peculiar doubling
forward position that gives the ap
pearance of being weak and sickly,
and, in fact, such is very often the
case, for the shoulders press over on
the chest and cramp the breath so
that exercise of any kind is exceed
ingly tiresome.
A splendid exercise Is to lie flat on
the back. Take a deep, full breath and
draw the feet upward, keeping the
kr.ees unbent, until the knees are ver
tical. Lower them slowly until hori
zontal and then keep them rigid and
stiff. Now fill the chest and draw the
body up until you are sitting erect as
in figure 1. Then drop back slowly and
repeat until you are tired. This will
most likely take less time than the
other exercise, for It tells tremendous
ly, in fact the majority of people are
so weak that they\can hardly do this
once without feeling it very decidedly.
Occasionally there . are some people
who are so constituted that It would
be a physical Impossibility for them to
raise themselves without the aid of a
toe strap. But this difficulty is easily
surmounted, for an ordinary piece of
strap fastened to the baseboard of your
room, so that each foot will have a
loop to go into, is all that is required,
and it Is so simple that any one can
fashion it in a very few minutes. Now
and then It is advisable to rest by
bringing the left leg well up. so that it
will be at right angles to the trunk.
Then,' of course, the same thing is
done with the right leg and later with
both legs as in figure 3.
The woman who rides horseback very
much should practice wnat is known
as the scissor exercise. This is ac
complished by lying flat on the floor
with the arms under the head and then
slowly raising. the right leg and cross
ing It over the left one as In figure 4.
The .right leg and then the left one are
alternated and then both are lowered
to the floor, where the ankles are twist
ed inward and outward in order to
strengthen the tailor muscles, which,
by the way, is the longest muscle in
There is one more exercise that I
want to mention, because it seems, to
form a part of this article,- and that is
the "bicycle" motions. Lie flat on the
floor; raise the legs and body on the
shoulders, the hands resting on the hips
as in fig. 6. Then kick Vigorously up
and down, so that the thighs will 'come
down and strike) all ; the diaphragm
muscles. There, is one caution I want to
give you, or else you will have a 'beau-'
tlful black e ye. At first you will wobble'
and if the head is not perfectly straight
your knees,, in passing each side of
the head, will come down and strike
you in -the face- So, until you. get the
motion down to a fine point, be care
ful and go at it slowly, foT Just aa sure
as you try to hurry you will come to
grief. .'.-." ' . . :
This movement, by the! way. has an
other virtue. The woman who wears
corsets all the day 'should, practice this
until she Is quite perfect at it, for -it
will rest her quicker than anything
else she may do. This, of course, holds
good when the woman la heavy, and

of walking and running In the open
air. but occasionally it Is quite im
possible to accomplish, and in this
event a. running exercise taken in an
open window is a fair substitute. Trot
briskly and rapidly on one spot with
the hands on the hips and lift the
feet .briskly with a clean, quick mo
tion. Take from 100 to 300 steps and
be sure- to take deer> and long inspir
ations, for running without proper
breathing is not worthy of Its name.
Jumping rope is another excellent
movement. Borrow the clothes line
or anything that happens to come
handy and have a good., lively Jump
first with one foot, then with the
other and finally with both at the
tame time. It is child's play, I know,
but if grown folks devoted a little
time now and then, to real, hard play
they would be much better off for It.
Never exercise more than half an
hour at a time and then let there b<Â»
intermissions of rest. Try to see that
each and every gesture is well de
fined and separate, for if one move
ment runs into another the work is
not clean looking, and besides laziness
is spelled with capital letters.
While the legs are so actively en
peged in these exercises, there are
other parts that are not idle by any
manner of means, and these same mo
tions brine strength to other parts of
the body as well. In every step taken,
especially every vigorous one, the
muscles at the eides of the waist are
bi:sy- at work and the stronger they
grow the more erect the body will be
held, for it is their business to see that
the body does not sway from side to
F!de as you walk or that it does not
bend in slip-shod fashion.
This weariness is caused by weak
back and abdominal muscles. Per
haps you do not realize it, but let me
tell you that th^re are comparatively
few women "whS can stretch out full
length on the floor and raise and low
er their limbs .systematically. First
the legs are raised slowly until they
are at right angles with the body, as
in figure 2. and.: then, are lowered to
the floor In the Fame fashion. â¢ It cer
tainly seems easy enough, doesn't it?
But try it and see if the strain is not
bo great that the legs come down
quickly or else drop helplessly. Every
muscle is pulled sharply and unless
they are used to this unusual work
they refuse to obey. . This exercise,
simple, as it is, would do a gTeat deal
far Â¦women in general if they would
devote five minutes a day to It, for
half their ailments and pains would
disappear as though by magic, and,
what is ..more to the point, never re
turn.
PEOPLE vrrite constantly, -"Will
tkin foods help ray complexion?"
.Fancy such a question. It may
be of tome small benefit, but let
me assure you ii?ht here that any skin
' food alone will accomplish very little,
and it is the height of folly to expect
that any external lotion will work in a
miraculous fashion. It is quite right to
give to the skin "ami tissues all the
nourishment, from the outside that is
possible, as all athletes know full well,
â¢but to gain any real or lasting benefits
you must fiust get the" body into perfect
rendition, and then by some very sim
ple exercises keen it that way.. There
is no beauty doctor in .the land that
can give.. the same smooth, .rosy com
plexion that Dame Nature can. and she
demands certain requirements before
she'adds her last 'finishing- and beauti
fying'touches.
If 1 were to. say to you. '"Don't" waste
your energy and "strength Â¦ in . losing
your temper over small thing's." you
Â¦ would in. all probability laugh and
straightway forget it in your- mad rush
to possess more of that precious cream.
Every one of us has just so much
vital force, and if it is ivasted on trifles
.we' most certainly are the losers and
have but ourselves . to blame. Every
angry word decreases our strength,
and really nine times out of ten it is
not worth the while. The woman who
laughs and grows fat is the one who is
the most popular, and she is by far the
best looking, and at: the same time she
gets more out of Â¦ life, for she takes
v hat comes her way and is duly thank
ful. She r.<>Fsesses a contented spirit
that is priceless. And what is? the re
sult? Good looks.. For be it known that
nothing fixes di^ypreeable ugly lineson
the face as quickly as scowling and
discontent, and they, can be kept away
only by .holding; yourself above the pet
ty trials of life. .
There are few Â»omo"n who do not tire
.easily. They fancy themselves as strong
as the average, but after a little exer
tion â shopping, for instanceâ they drop
into the nearest tea parlor or cafe and
get something; to "set them up." This is
not risrht. and for two excellent rea
fohs. In the Hint place, something must
be lacking physically, and then again,
which i.s more important perhaps from
a woman's standpoint, stimulants of
any' kin"d make one prematurely old.
Â¦.The muscles about the' mouth relax,
and drooping lines are anything but
pretty and never fail to suggest old

PHYSICAL CULTURE AT HOMEJANET (Cosmetics.)â Using cosmetics
of any kind is not a crime and I most

if I were you I would not sit meekly

younger or sweeter looking. Believe
me, any woman who really tries can
deceive the keenest eyes and It is fool

stroys an otherwise fine appearance.
Begin first by dressing yourself with
all possible care, for this in itself goes

The means usually employed in

it hot and wring cloths out of it and
lay It over the face. Continue this
for some fifteen minutes. At the end
of this time anoint the face with
green soap. Rub It in well for five
minutes and then rinse it*all out with
hot water, using a brush, and not only
the soap will be removed, but many
of the blackheads as well. After this
dry the face and rub in a good skin
food or cream. This treatment should
be continued until the blackheads
have entirely disappeared, and it is
not a bad Idea to do it every once in a
while to prevent their returning.

TREATMENT FOR SUNBURN
(Mina). â If you expect to get any rest
or enjoyment from a brief vacation
do not start out to do "stunts," to use
the vernacular of the day. Take Ufa
comfortably and you will get an im-Â«
mense amount of fun and refreshment
out of even a brief trip. Returning to
town with numerous experiences to
relate may seem quite smart to the
novice, but the traveler who Is wise
avoids "thrilling novelties" at resorts.
A day on the water in the broiling sun,
with an aftermath of blisters, may be
n legitimate part of one's vacation,
but the woman who realizes how all
sensible people look upon such unnec
essary exposures will not be foolish
enough to turn her cheek a second
time for old Sol to smite; not a bit of
it. However, in case you fall a victim
to sunburn here Is a method of sub
duing it, which has , been tried and
found to be all that is claimed for it.
First, to relieve the painful inflam
mation make a solution of one part of
carbolic acid to 400 parts of water, or
hi other words, five or six drops of the
acid to a glassful of water. Wet a
piece of old linen and lay over the
burned skin, keeping the cloth wet for
several hours. If the skin is blistered,
ERADICATING STAINS ON CLOTH
(H. B. S.). â It is doubtful If anything
will entirely remove" the' stain left by
nitrate of silver on cloth, for' it is an
important ingredient in the making
of indelible Inks. If the article you
speak of is a valuable one why not
worn is the safest and the least wob
bly.
Â¦ And so it is even in such a small
matter as holding up a skirt. Extremes
are always foolish and never fail to ex
cite unpleasant comment. The gown
that looked so fetching at home is un
deniably loud for the street, and there
is scarcely a woman, if she will ac
knowledge the truth to herself, wh(r
has not gone forth prepared to conquer
and who has suddenly discovered her
self rudely jolted into the commonplace
and the absurd. And how it does hurt!
Perhaps just at the time when dignity
was coveted the most and when there
was a SDecial reason for this unwar
ranted burst of extremes.
The girl who suddenly spies a cer
tain man in a crowd is more than apt
to do just what she wishes most to
avoid. She promptly goes to extremes
instead of going on her way in a plain,
every-day sort of manner. She pushes
her hat a little more to the side, fluffs
the bow out at her throat and pulls
her skirt a little tighter and a little
higher and then realizes, when it was
too late, that she has stumbled, and
that the swift, bungling step was any
thing but pleasant.
An.d po it is, and ever will be, for
each and every one must learn this les
son by experience. The trifles are the
things that make life, and more de
pends upon them than one knows or
realizes. A few words, a gesture or a
smile will ruin the pleasure of an aft
ernoon, and how can you expect to es
cape them If you will constantly and
even eagerly go more than half-way to
meet them?
Do what you please in your own
home, but do try to be dignified on the
public thoroughfares. And, to return
to small things. Jot down In your mem
ory's tablet that if you grab your
clothes as though you were handling a
bale of hay and stride down the street
at a two-forty clip you are making a
woeful spectacle of yourself.
And really, there isn't kny sense in it.
True, the full, short skirts are difficult
to manage, and there are times when,
short as they are, it is Imperative to
pick them up, but if you will gather
the fullness at the belt line with your
hand and elevate and twist your wrist
the fkirt will cling much closer and will
be out of harm's way, and you can trip
daintily along in an absolutely com
monplace but delightfully dignified
manner.
WASHING WHITE SILK WAISTS
(J. B. L..).â I know of no reliable
method whereby a. waist of white silk
may be washed and yet 'retain a per
fectly pure white color without injury
to the silk. Either a pure white or
cream white silk can be washed so it
will be beautifully clean and have only
a slight-tint of cream resulting, which,
from ah artistic standpoint, adds
rather than detracts. Proceed in the
following manner and I am sure you
will be pleased. with the result. Shave
one-fourth of an ordinary bar of white
laundry soap in a -quart of hot water,
dissolve and strain through a cheese
cloth bag into a .tub half filled with
lukewarm water. I emphasize strain,
as any particle, of undissolved soap
lodged on the silk would cause a shiny
yellow spot when the garment was
ironed. Plunge the Waist in the suds
and zeittlv squeeze all parts until sat
urated; let soak for ten or fifteen min
utes; repeat the squeezing process, rub
bing only when absolutely necessary;,
then rinse quickly in two clear luke
warm waters. Put plenty of clear cold
water in a tub. dissolve a little bluing
In a. quart of water and strain enough
of the fluid through fine' muslin to
slightly tint the water. Verv little
must be used or the Bilk will look blue
and grimy. Always test the water by
dipping into It a small piece of silk.
Hang the garment In a strong wind out
of the sun. so it will dry quickly.
While still damp, but not wet, iron the
garment on the wrong side, using as
cool an iron as will suffice to remove
wrinkles. Hot or very warm water "or
Irons, coarse soap and much soaking
or rubbing will ruin the. texture and
color of white silk waists. "
THE new short skirt is a marvel
â¢when it conies to comfort, but
have yo.u ever tried to hold it
up? Ye gods! What a hopeless
muddle it does make or itself. Yes,
and Incidentally of you, for the one is
not complete- without the other.
When the skirt that just cleared the
ground came in with a gust of wind
and & downpour of rain it was con
sidered something pretty fine, but an
innovation that was to be treated
charily. So much so. in fact, that un
less the r3in was coming down in
bucketfuls it was more or l<*ss risque
to venture out and boldly display a
third of ah inch of ankle. And the
funny part of it all was that these
selfs-ame lassies would sail, serenely
down a public avenue swathed about
v.ith yards of frills and furbelows, but
held at an alarming angle. What dif
ference did that make if the ank'le3
were trim and the boots dainty? That
the material was there and in plain
Fight If any one cared to look was all
that was necessary or required.
But now the times have changed
and frocks have Just about .reversed
their positions. The trailing ruffles
are left at home as long as the~~sun
is in power and the short Fkirt sways
supreme. And what an absolute
tyrant it is! With yards and yards
of thin silk they flutter and fly about
-and just about keep one distracted
trying to hold them in place, for no
sooner is one side reefed in enough to
defy the winds than the other is exe
cuting- an animated blow-away dancÂ«
and beckoning and flirting with every
tiny gust that chances along in a most
outrageous manner.
Then comes 'a perk of trouble. If
you make a depp^rate clutch at one
Bide to prevent the whole from float-
Ing serenely over your head, you raise
the short folds higher than you in
tended and come back to earth with
a dull thud only when you realize that
you are affording others more than a
little amusement.
On the other hand, if 'you move
quickly and without thinking you are
more than apt to put out both hands
and draw the toy balloon to the front,
and th*n you are in a worse predica
ment than before. ThÂ«Â»re you stand
for the world and all like your great
gTandmother. lifting up her precious
Sunday-go-to-meeting black silk to
avoid a two-by-four puddle. To say
the least you are not the acme of
crace and there is something irresist
ibly laughable at>out the woman who
makes of herself a veritable Mother
Bunch.
Then there is the chorus girl style.
For some reason or other it isn't espe
cially fetching or captivating, and
while people undoubtedly stare, it is an
cpen Question as to what they are
thinking. First, as much of the skirt
Is gathered into the hand as can be
conveniently got hold of. One would
think that this would be sufficient, but
it Isn't by any manner of means. Still
Â¦holding en to it for grim life, another
volume is- gathered in from some
where, preferably from the side and
front' breadths, and away you go. mak
ing an unholy exhibition of yourself.
In thp first place the steps are all
mincing and small and every one is ac
companied by a little fluff-fluff of pet
ticoats and silk and an amazing length
of hosiery. And, pray tell, how could
it very well be otherwise? The skirt,
as full as any dressmaker can make It,
is held as snugly across the back and
hips as is possible, and that straight,
tight line goes to the depth of the
knees, where it is suddenly let loose" to
fly and Ewitch abo-at as it pleases. At
"the uame time, this gathering in all
stray folds from the front necessarily
takes away from the length and only
the eager onlooker can fully appreci
ate how extremely abbreviated the
otherwise pretty Ekirt Is.
There is a happy medium in all
things, and even if.it takes an endless
amount of practice and work, it Ehould
be struck. To be too perfect Is almost
as bad as to be too carei^g, for it ex
cites not so much the envy as the deri
eion of crur Trlends who live in a most
Imperfect world. They watch every

that we have reared for ourselves, and
all eagerness to witness the collapse

IMPROVING THE . HAIR AND
SCALP (Mrs. V.),â When the scalp
itche3 without eruption, is more or
less affected with dandruff, the hair
splits badly at the end3 though long
and thick and naturally oily and the
treatment has been monthly sham
pooing and the use of glycerin, I am
sure the glycerin is causing the trou
ble. Glycerin is a fluid few can use
without having it greatly diluted and
even then it -is often highly irritating
to a very sensitive skin. You aeem to
ba one who ought not to use it, and
its use has probably irritated your
scalp to such an extent that it has In
duced the dandruff and itchlns. It
will also cause the hair to remain
moist and oily looking, while its stick
iness will collect quantities of impuri
ties which tend to. irritate the sensi
tive pores. Free the hair and scalp
of glycerin .by a thorough, shampoo,
â¢rubbing the mixture into the scalp
with the finger tips or a small brush,
and then proceed In the usual Way.
To make a good shampoo for the pur
pose take two teaspoonfuls of tincture
Df green- soap; obtainable at any drug
store; one teaspoonful of cologne and
the white of one egt;, well beaten.

of lukewarm water. .

LIVEH OR MOTH SPOTS (J. B. L.)
â In response to numerous inquiries
the treatment for moth spots on
the face is repeated this week. Begin
by putting your system in the best
possible condition, for a torpid liver
and a defective circulation are usually
at the bottom of the trouble. Slug
gish circulation in the capilaries of
the skin causes the deposit of coloring
matter to settle in spots in the layers
of the epidermis, hence external and
internal remedies may be used simul
taneously with beneficial results.
Drink at least a half pint of hot water
every morning before breakfast, get
some dandelion pills at the drug store
and take one each night before re
tiring and another In the morning to
relieve the liver and blood of accumu
lated impurities. Continue the pills
for at least six months, taking but one
each dav after the first three months.
Each day, preferably morning and
evening, the stomach and abdomen
should be massaged to excite more
rapid circulation, and incidentally thi3
treatment will assist all the internal
organs to perform t their several func
tions with greater regularity. Gently
knead over these organs and follow
with a rotary motion, using the palms
of the hands, continuing the exercise
for at least twenty minutes. Avoid all'
foods which are likely to cause biliary
disorders, arising from a deranged
liver. More activity is needed in the
muscles of the face, as well as the
skin, and this, too. is readily obtained
by massage, doing the work just be
fore going to bed and always preced
ing it by a thorough face bath; the
increased circulation will prevent fur
ther deposits and a bleach should be
applied to the s^pots to fade them out.
The time required to do this depends
largely upon the patient's health.
Have your druggist prepare the follow
ing and apply it daily to the spots with
beauty and o!d age. Here are three
receipts that are good for night use,
but be careful how you doctor your
relf in the day time. A liquid powder
is always good to put on first, but be
sure to soften it with a soft powder.
Here is the liquid whitener:
Water, boiled and strained.. ..1 quart
Alcohol 30 drops
Oxide of zinc 1 ounce
Bichloride of mercury 8 grains
Glycerine 20 drops
mussed by the spread of the water.
Sponge the stain with enough clear
water to moisten thoroughly, then
make a Btrong brine of common table
salt, two tablespoonfuls to one teacup
ful of hot water. When cold wet the
stain and keep saturated for two or
three, hours, or until the brown color
fades out. Then wash the spot with
a solution of ammonia, one teaspoon
ful of ammonia to a pint of tepid
water, and complete by rinsing In two
or three clear waters, for every trace
of salt and ammonia must be removed.
To clean the white leghorn hat, rip
off all trimmings, brush free from dust

M. J. (Working Girl).â It is poor pol
icy to look as though you worked for a
living. Of course, it is not necessary
to say that you should dress plainly
and almost severely, but do try to be
dressed in style and to look as though
you were accustomed to the better
things of life. A. plain shirt waist, linen
collar and pretty, ties, tailor made suits
and good hats are always easy to get,
and they ne%er fail to look neat and
appropriate. Laces and furbelows are
the height of folly in an office. In the
first place they are entirely out of

keep them fresh and sweet looking.
While in an office try to realize that

known as laudanum. The mixture

BADGE
OF
SERVICE
THE play 'was over. *ihe curtain
had gone down, amidst tremen
dous applause, on a fitting ta
bleauâthe heroine clasped in ..he
hero's arms, the villain, van
quished but defiant, glaring at them
from the papier-mache arbor, and the
pair of secondary lovers indulging in
expressive pantomime on a balcony
that threatened momentarily to col
lapse.
True love had run its uneven course
for an hour and three-quarters, and
after surviving a series of idiotic mis
haps, absurd doubts and all the other
obstacles an enthusiastic amateur play
wright could put in its path, it had
emerged unscathed and triumphant.
The orchestra was playing the latest
popular march as a sort of recessional
for the admiring relatives of friends.
Lady Gatacre, still in costume, sank
wearily into a rickety .wooden chair
In one of the little anterooms near the
stage. Sir. Charles Windon climbed a
pile of properties used in act I and,
perched there ' precariously, rested his
chin on his upturned palms and sur
veyed the lady thoughtfully.'
"I suppose I should apologize," he
began tentatively, "still I would like to
cay a word in self-defense. May I?"
"Go on," . said Lady Gatacre coldly.
"Well, I thought the scene demanded
it. -It seemed to make. it- more ; real.
In everyday life the man would have
done it." ' \ ,
"Well?" Bhe said in challenge as he
paused. â¢> "<:Â¦:-'
"Andâ and so I did," he Â« cald lamely.
"And that Is your- excuse." she asked
with considerable asperity.
"If I need one, yes," said. he.
Lady Gatacre regarded him icily. Her
nose was elevated the fraction of an
inch.
"I suppose you realize fully the em
barrassing position you placed me in?"
she said.
"Believe me, I didn't Intend to," he
remonstrated.
"Of course you heard that very au
dible titter in the audience?" she went
on.
He nodded.
"It was none of their business," he
complained.
"If," she said quickly, "you hadn't
made it so apparent; if you hadn't
paused, debated as it were, it wouldn't
have been, quite so conspicuous. But
when you stopped and looked about
and thenâ and then â " Â¦ "
"Kissed you," he supplied almost tri
umphantly.
"Oh, it was too ghastly evident that
it- was impromptu," she finished.
"I was perfectly willing to rehearse
that piece of business," he suggested.
"It .was unfair of you," she said
hotly. "We agreed to . leave It out â
that it was ridiculous and unneces
sary."
"It became qul^e necessary when you
appeared in that gown. I'm only hu
man, you know." â¢;*;.-.â¢:â¢: .'
"I am an irresponsible party, that's
a fact,", said he. "Look here, if I say
I'm sorry, do you forgive me?"' ;^i
"Sorry for what? Forâforâ"
"For putting you in an embarrassing
position: for the other, never!" .
Lady Gatacre frowned and flushed. â¢-
"You'll have to be sorry for both be-
fore you're forgiven," she said.
"Then I shall die unabsolved H " he de
clared with finality.
"It seems to me you're making a bad
matter worse," said she.
"Well, turn about is fair play," he re
plied. "That is just what you've been
doing the past three weeks."
"I fear I don't follow you," said Lady
Gatacre.
"When we started rehearsing this
time," said he, "I was beginning to fall
in love with you; that was the 'bad
matter.* Since we've been rehearsing
you have completed what was already
begun; that's 'the worse.' " -
He looked at her steadily. Lady Gat
acre studied the toe of her shoe. He
could see her cheeks were crimson.
"Are you. angry, because I said I
loved you ?" he questioned.
She was silent.
"Are you?" he persisted. â¢
Still she was silent.
Sir Charles permitted himself a
covert smile.
"If it's only the kiss " he-began.
She sat up suddenly.*
"It was the. way you did It!" she
flashed, and her eyes again sought the,
Interesting^shoe.
"The way I did it," he. chuckled. "I
think-! â well.- 1 hadn't .rehearsed It, you
know â I think with a few rehearsals
I could do it better."
He came close beside her and laid
a hand on her hair.
""I want to rehearse it through all
my lifetime," he said earnestly.
He Â¦ waited patiently.- . Presently
Lady Gatacre^- looked up at him and
smiled.
"Youâ you really do need rehears
ing in that line,"' she said.
But the villain and the pair of sec
ondary -'-lovers >. were -lacking' to com- -

WANTED: A REHEARSAL

â¢Â«Â« jr AY ALLY.V stepped from the
â¢ f\ /j olevalor with a bit of lace in
I V I her hand. She walked
" >i I. through the rotunda, "looking
'Â¦: "^ to the right and left among
the massixe pillars and drooping palms.
There were few persons in sight. Most
of the jruests were over on the beach.
' for it was the bathing hour. May went
nearly across tho rotunda before she
found the object of her search â a
wiman in a retired corner reading a
novel.
"Here you are, mamma," she ex
claimed rebuklngly.. "and reading that
novel, as 1 mipht have expected.
.Don't you know the characters in it
Mould slay exactly where you leave
' them if you should close the book for
a few huurs, and this glorious weather
outside is something of the present.
But see here." holding up- the lace for
inspection, ""do you think this will
do?" . â¢
"For what?''
"Oh, you know' mamma! I'm. to be
Betty, the maid. In the play we're get
ting up, and am to have' the white
badge of servitude Â«<n my head and
wear a wrhlte apron and carry a broom
or something. I've fold it all over be
fore, only your head's in that book. Do
please shut it."
.The older woman obeyed with a
Bigh and took the bit of fleecy lace be
tween her fingers.
"No, it won't do at all. May," she
eaid instantly, a ripple of amusement
breaking the dreamy quiet of her face.
. "Jt wouldn't be appropriate."
"But why?" with an air of disap
pointment. ."It is eo pretty."
"Yes, and costly. Child, child, don't
you know that' bit of laÂ«.e is worth as
much as Betty, the maid, could earn in
rive years. You must have something
cheap to be in character."
"I don't believe I have anything."
"No, I suppose not. You will .have
to try at one of the stores. You will
need â " Mrs. Allyn's gaze went in
quiringly about the rotunda until it
found one of the hotel maids dusting
a plant. She waited until she caught
the girl's eye, then raised a finger.
N "I beg your pardon, my dear." she
. Raid as the girl approached, "but my
daughter here is to be in the church
benefit arid will have to wear a cos
tume something like yours. "Would
you mind my looking at your pretty
lace cap a moment?"
The girl removed it witn a pleased
look.
"This is exactly what jou want.
May." went on Mrs. Allyn, holding it
up critically. "You â "
â¢ ' But May had snatched the little cap
from her upraised fingers and placed
it upon her own fluffy brown hair.
"Nov.- let rne have your apron a
minute, please." she cried merrily.
"Thank you," as the girl complied and
she fastened the apron to her waist
with deft fingers. "And now the dust
ing brush. There, mamma, how will
this do?" with a flourish of the brush
and .a sweeping courtesy.
'The girl laughed, and. even Mrs. Al
lyn smiled Indulgently as May danced
away toward the middle of the ro
tunda, flirting the brush indiscrimin
ately over jardinieres and palm leaves
as' she passed. Soon the pillars and
palms intervened and concealed her
view.
Count I'Ortegan aiTd' a young Amer
ican Fculptor were just entering: the
rotunda. They had known each other
in Paris and met again on the steam
er coming oven, and now they had
come to Gray Harbor together, not be
cause they had much in common, but
they were acquainted and all'the.peo
pl* around were strangers.
Â¦ May did not notice them until they
stopped beside her -with exclamations
of astonishment and pleasure.
"Mademoiselle Allyn, ees It possar-
That was when I did it. "Her head
was on my shoulder, but her faqe
somehow got twisted up and I. kissed
her full on the lips. Phyllis' llpa are*
warm and soft.
"Oh. Jack!" she whispered. '
Then I kissed her again.- Buf I only
kissed her twice. An event is but mo
mentary: let it last longer and it sinks'
to the level of a mere incident.
"And It's my family you like, Is It/
Phyllis?" I asked her.
Phyllis nodded her head.- She was*
too close to see her do it. but I could,
feel it on my shoulder.
"Fred or Charlie?" I asked again.
"I guess â I think â er â their*
brother."
After that I forgot all that rot about
an event being but momentary. Any
how, what's the odds if it is? People
don't go through life looking for events
all the time. Commonplace things are
much nicer. .
"And you're going to.be engaged to
me now for all the time?" I questioned
when I got my breath.
. "No." said Phyllis, shaking her head.
"Please, dearest," I sa"id; "I want you*
so â so much. Please say you will."
But Phyllis shook her head.
"No," said she with a happy little
laugh. "It'll have to stop when you
marry me."
"I really do, Phyllis. "Without .yon
I'm like that.*oul which the poet tells
about. 'That went into the storm and
blackness and lost itself between thÂ»
earth and heaven.* " ;
Phyllis sat a little closer to me. It*Â»
a good dodge, is that poetry business.
I've always felt that I owed " a good
deal to some of those poet Johnnies. *
"That was awfully dear of you.
Jack." she whispered- .
I felt a goodish bit like a cad then. It
seemed so like taking an unfair advan-,
tage. Yet it wasn't that I didn't mean
it for I did, every word of it. . .
"Phyllis," I half whispered, "shall I.
break my word?"
Phyllis never said a word, but Justs*
crept a little closer. I dared and put
my arm around her. â¢ .-. .
Now, it's always been my contention;
that when a girl says "Stop" In a whis
per that she means the exact opposite.
"Stop!" whispered Phyllis.
"If I were sure â " I began.
"If I â¢ give you my Â¦word," n!d.
Phyllis.
."Phyllis," I said soberly,- **lf yÂ»tx
said the word, I'd wait till the day of
doom" for you, dear. But' you know,
little girl, I don't want to. I want you
now."
Phyllis' eyes had lost that bard
glow. There was only thÂ» dull, soft
fire of .burnished copper now. I ought
to have taken her in my arms and
kissed her right there. But I dldnt
know enough. I was always noted,
for doing such stupid things. Phyllis
has told me so since.
"Do you really. Jack?" said : Â«hÂ»
softly. " Â¦
"I don't see what difference it would
make," I commented.
"Because if you will," said Phyllia.
"I'll wait until I'm ready or on the
shelf and then come around and ask
you. Only I'd like to be sure you
were disengaged."
I guess I must have looked a' bit
blank, because Phyllis burst out laugh
ing.
"How long will it be?" I asked.
"I really can't say," laughed Phyllia.
"If I decide to wait until I'm ready
for the shelf, I flatter myself It will
be some time yet."
"So do I," I said, sadly. . .
"Well," asked Phyllis with sera*
asperity,- "you don't hope- for any
thin?: else, do you?"
But the thought of it seemed. *. Ions
way ahead.
"Toâ" ' , â¢
"Not to ask any ether girl either,"
finished Phyllis.
"Will you make me a promise?"
questioned Phyllis.
laughed.
"Remember,"- 1 warned her, "it was
the last time."

a iÂ«*-vHYLLIS," said I solemnly, "do
â¢ â¢ J you know what day this is?"
y"^ "Friday. September, the
X twenty-first, nineteen hundred
and three." repeated Phyllis glibly.
"Yes," said I, shaking my head
tragically; "yes, this is the fated day.
the accursed hour. The time has come."
Phyllis laughed. When Phyllis laughs
the prettiest dimples come in her
cheeks. I have accused her of laugh
ing Just to bring them there, but she
'only laughs the more.
"Phyllis," I warned her; "those dim
ples."
I tltink they grew even deeper.
"And I'm such a weak one," I mur
mured thoughtfully.
"We're geting away from the Ques
tion," replied Phyllis v.ith swift in
consequence. "What about the date?"
I assumed my most melancholy air.
My eye caught the corner of my
pocket handkerchief and I pulled it out.
"The day of our parting,"I replied
briefly, smothering a pseudo sob.
Phyllis' brows met in a perplexed
frown, a most adorable frown.
"I don't get it," she said.
"It's your own doing," I asserted,
throwing the j blame on her; "it was
entirely your own suggestion and you
have no one to blame but yourself."
Still Phyllis frowned. I know a wa*
I could have smoothed out the
wrinkles.
"Why, our engagement, you know,"
I insinuated. "It was expressly un
derstood, I thought, that it was strictly
a summer affair."
At last Phyllis comprehended. For a
moment I thought she was going to
smile and enjoy the joke. But instead
her eyes grew wide with amazement,
and then she buried her face in her
handkerchief. There was no mistaking
it; the sobs were too violent to'be any
thing but genuine.
"Phyllis?" I Interrogated in amaze
ment. "Phyllis! What is it, dear?"
I don't believe either of us noticed
the last word.
Then she dried her eyes and straight
ened up her head.
"I never thought, Jack," said Phyllis
with considerable indignation, "that you
would have reminded me of it. And on
the very day summer is over, too. It
seems to me you were In rather a hurry
to have it ended."
"But Phyllisâ" I blundered.
"Yes, "but Phyllis,' " she mocked me;
"I suppose you were afraid that if it ran
a day over it would mean a renewal of
the contract. Or perhaps you thought I
wouldn't let you out of it. You needn't
have worried, I assure you."
Phyllis was holding her head very
high. A sunbeam playing across her
brown ljair set it afire. Her eyes needed
no sunbeam. I never saw Phyllis look
more hanQsome.
And then, while I grew redder and
more shame-faced, I saw the little vix
en was laughing at me.
"Jack," she said, "there's something
I like about you. I don't know what
it is; I think it must be your family."
That set me on my high horse.
"Ah!" I murmured indifferently. "Good
of you, I'm sure. Perhaps you have
even picked out which oneâ Fred or
Charlie?" ' â¢: -
"I'm not quite sure." said Phyllis,
roguishly. The dimples were there
again.
"Phyllis." I said. "I'm never going to
ask you to marry me. again."
"I don't want, to marry you again,"
answered Phyllis.
"You haven't yet," I retorted. "What
I mean is that I am never again going
to ask you."
"Never?" answered Phyllis, in mock
terror. .
"Never!" said I firmly; "this Is the
very last time. Will you marry me?"
"That's once over, right there," she
blc!" cried the Count rapturously. "Eel
is in Paris that you vanish this three
mont', and we nevaire know to where.
Some say to Ital'ee, and some that you
fly back to heaven, where they keep ze
angels. But eet is heaven that you
make anywhere. Now I know why the
place here seem so beautiful; eet is the
angrell"
May laughed and gave him her hand.
"Thank you. Count." she said. "I am
glad to see you also.' You are sure to
like it here â even without the angel.-
And ygix, too. Mr. liethune," offering
her hand to the sculptor. "Can you not
make a :>retty speech like the Count?"
"1 am afraid not." smiling down at
her. "Only that I am very, very glad tc
find you here. Miss Aliyn.< Your pres
ence will add much to â to our pleas
ure."
"Why, really, that docs very nicely."
She twirled the brush with a pretty,
unconscious movement that caused the
tips of its feathers to flick across one
of the palm fronds near. The motion
caught the Count's attention, and with
wondering consternation his eyes went
from it to her white anron and to the
badge of servitude upon her head, and
his sloping shoulders stiffened suddenly
into protesting reserve.
"Pardonnez," he rebuked, '..'but eet is
so hurry I am now. I will see. Mon
sieur Bethune will tell you we have not
register yet. I will do eet now."
May watched him hurry away with
an odd look of inquiry in her eyes.
"What's the matter with the Count?"
she asked innocently. "Has he forgot
ten something?"
Bethune laughed joyously, a moment
before there had been both' reserve
and repression in his eyes, now they
were suddenly eager, glowing, deter
mined.
"The Count's an odd sort of stick,"
he answered, "and his visit here is
confessedly in search of a rich Ameri
can wife."
He raised his hand significantly to
ward her head; but for a moment she
looked puzzled, then a quick, compre
hending Hush rose to her face.
"Oh, that!" she said thoughtfully.
"And you?"
Bethune laughed again. He could not
help it
"Can't you see, Miss Allyn?" he de
manded. "I fancied it was sticking out
all over me. Over yonder I was a
poor devil of an artist and you a rich
heiress, and now â oh. May!"
There was the soft rustle of silk mov
ing across the carpet. May raised her
finger.
"Mamma is coming," she warned.
"I don't care," impetuously. "I've
got to speak now. I can't wait an
other day. Where can I see you
alone?"
She hesitated, then appeared to con
sider.
"The maids and nurses usually walk
on the beach at about 3 o'clock," she
said demurely. "I expect I shall be
there."
At 4 o'clock two wheel chairs swept
leisurely down the bicycle avenue and
on past the Breakers toward the beach.
It was the hour for Mrs. Allyn's daily
outing, and she preferred to take it in
a wheel chair and leisurely. The occu
pant of the other chair was Count
l'Ortegan, and from the satisfaction
on his face he had evidently discovered
the mistake. As they turned toward
the beach path they saw two figures
approaching them only a fÂ»w yards
â¢away.
"There's May now!" exclaimed Mrs.
Allyn. "Suppose we wait a few min
utes and speak with her."
The Count's face grew eager, and
words of an elaborate apology began
to form in his mind; but as the figures
drew n.ear and he saw the expression
on their faces as they looked at each
other the apology died w away and a
Parisian oath, muttered under his
breath, took Its place. He merely
bowed politely and then waited for
Mrs. Allyn to give the signal to go on.

THEIR
SUMMER
ENGAGEMENT
By the lime the great organ pealed
out the triumphant strains of the wed
ding march he and the maid of honor,
their masks on. faced the guests that
filled the church, ready to play their
parts for all they were worth. Some
thing In the music was at once an in
spiration and a challenge.
"Isn't she sweet?" whispered one
of the guests to a companion, refer
ring to the maid of honor, "but how
pale she is and what a curious look
there is in her eyes, sort of â¢nothing
can-ever-matter-again' expression, and
yet â "
The speaker stopped, staring
thoughtfully at the girl until she had
passed.
More than once during the course
of the wedding breakfast that fol
lowed the " best man found himself
watching her curiously. No one was
gayer tl\an she; none so gay, in fact.
Her eyes were brilliant and her laugh
rang out valiantly, but his own mis
ery made him subtly conscious of
.some undercurrent of feeling that was
running strong and pitiless under the
surface bubbles â an undertow of mis
ery that she was resisting with all
her strength.
He remembered that when, during
the ceremony, their eyes had met in
that confused, unveiled glance, she had
been staring at the groom as intently
as he at the bride. Could it be?
He did not formulate the thought, but
he watched her more keenly than ever
after that; so keenly, indeed, that once,
unable to bear/ it any longer with an
appearance of unconsciousness, she
taxed him with it.
"You are very rude!" she said light
ly, but at his grave, sincere "Believe
me, I have not meant to be," and the
searching look that accompanied it,
expressive of a sympathy he could not
put into words, her lips quivered ever
so slightly. "Weddings get upon ray
nerves." she explained, with a little
grimace, and before he could reply she.
had turned away.
The shower of rice and old shoes had
spent itself, and the bride and groom
had departed, taking all the romance
of the world with them and leaving be
hind t a monotony without form and
void. All of the guests felt it and al
ready the bustle of departure was in
the air. But to the best man and the
maid of honor it was u. ghastly, ap
palling fact that made them linger on
the steps after the others had re-enter
ed the house, staring blankly after the

THROUGH the stained glass above
the pali^s and roses the midday
su\i streamed in, flecking the
sc*re with gorgeous reds, blues
ana greens. It shed a. golden glory
upon tbe tall, slender, graceful bride,
and at the sight tlu- bc-Ft man shut his
jaw a bit more determinedly. She was
looking more than ever like an angel,
and in five minutes s!ie would be the
Â¦wife of his best friend. That was the
monotonous sentence which kept re
peating itself |n his mind. As if he
were likely to forget!
Opposite blm a.nd just behind the
bride the maid â¢ f honor stoud. For the
moment she. tÂ«><Â«. had forgotten the

had a curious ft-eling that when she

back at her from her mirror â she
should still iiÂ« able to live over again
the despair of this moment, when the
Â¦white-robed clergyman was taking him
from her life a thousand times more
irrevocably than death could have done.
There was a stir about her like the
rush of the wind. For a second Bhe
was too lust in thought to understand.
Then, jis she dropped ujxjn her knees
somewhat hurriedly, her bewildered
eyes caught tho^e of the best man;
casually at first and then with a quick,
startled recognition of something she
saw there. He, too. had the air of a
pcreon suddenly awakened from a
nightmare, momentarily uncertain -of
the surroundings in which he found
himself.
A moment later she had forgotten
his very existence.

long broken breath and composing her

Meanwhile the best man admon

"Steady now, old man! Now's the
time to get out your happy smile."

pave no indication of relaxing, his
thoughts ran on crossly: "Don't be

the corner. Then the man remembered
where he was and pulled himself to
gether with an effort.
"Seems rather like the end of things,
doesn't it?" he observed as they turned

"From our- standpoint, yes." was the
listless answer. Then she caught her
Up between her teeth and darted a
quick, inquiring glance at him. That
was not precisely what she would have
chosen to say and she hoped that he
would not notice it. But at the sight
of the somber smile in his eyes the
hope passed. â¢
In a snug corner of the deserted
library, where the farewells of the de
parting guests come to them but
faintly, she next found herself, with
out being very clear as to how she
came there.' The best man was sit
ting in front* of her, holding one of
her hands in a protecting, big broth
erly fashion, while she vainly tried
to keep back the tears that seemed
to be -rising as quietly and relent
lessly as a flood. It was no use.
Higher and higher they came. She
winked hard and shut her teeth
firmly. Then she snatched her hand
away. and covered her face.
"My poor little girl," murmured
the hest man softly.
"Weddings are always sad, don't
you think?" she gasped out, dabbing
at her eyes with her handkerchief
and giving a little hysterical laugh.
"Still, I don't usually behave like this.
You see, when your best friend mar

explain the situation in despair, and
ended /with an Incoherent, "But it is
all very ridiculous, and I don't know
why I should say all this to you."
She was the picture of helpless,
girlish misery, and the best man'3
heart ached for her. Momentarily his
sympathy took the edge off his own
loneliness. He winced at the thought
of having to suffer alone the madden~
ing sense of loss that tormented him.
"Perhaps it's because misery loves

be confiding in each other.
She was watching him with a dawn-'
ing understanding in her eyes, and ha
met her gaze \yith a whimsical smile,
as if he were offering .her the open
book of his soul to read if she would.
"Do you mean that you too "
There was no need to complete thg
question, for it was answered before
it was spoken. Involuntarily her
hand3 went out to him* in a quieJc,.
warm sympathy, and though her only
comment was a breathless "Oh" It
Â¦was eloquent with feeling.
Little by little her composure cam*
back to her.
"It was so good of you to tell me,"
she said gratefully. "I think- 1 feel as
Robinson Crusoe did when he discov

"Not that I'm glad that you're un

it doesn't seem so lonely now that I
know that there's some one who under

looking up at him with what seemed
to him the sweetest look he had ever

at all.- and Margaret awoke with a
start to a realization that, after hav
ing made use of the young man, It
was not going to be as eas> to get rid
of him. But what annoyed her th'e
worst of all was the fact '.nat she felt
that she was not particularly anxious
to get rid of him. He had put down
his bags and settled himself in a way
that suggested that he meant to stay
until New York was reached.
"Do you believe in signs and
omens?" she asked.
"Sure! Something tells me this Is
going to be an awfully jolly trip. I
usually dread the ride into town, but
then â "
"Welli when I go home I shall say
unpleasant things to the friends who
advised me to take the boat trip down
the Hudson. Oh, I didn't mean to be
personal. I beg your pardon. I was
merely referring to the j babies and the
lunch. ; I can't sit on deck because
the sight of lunch boxes and perpetual
eating makes me positively 111."
"We'll remedy that. I know, a little
corner where they don t admit either
babies or lunch boxes. If, you'll just
wait a minute I'll fix the matter up.
I have a little stand-in with the cap
tain of this boat." ,\
He rose, but she laid a detaining
hand on his arm. "You really mustn't!
I â "'. ' V : '
"Now, see here," he eald frankly,
"you're ; calling: yourself all sorts of
things because we .haven't been -.in
troduced.' It's all nonsense, don't, you
know.' We . were bound ' to ; meet after
the â¢ conventional 'â¢Â¦'Â¦ fashion some day.
Somethingâ erâ tells me sol" .
It may have been that Margaret
wanted to get out In the fresh air, or
It may have been because she felt it
her duty to change the expression in
his eyes, which were looking at her
so eagerly. He strode down to 'the
purser's room and paid the price of
the best stateroom on the boat, which
gave them access to a tiny patch of
"deck room shut In on the other side
by a lifeboat, a stack of life preserv
ers and a most uncompromising rail
ing. From this point Margaret view
ed the beautiful panorama of . the
Palisades and the young man, loyal
New Yorker that he was, insisted that
it was purely his duty to make his
State show up at its best.
The last ten or fifteen minutes of
the .trip' were uncomfortable ones for
Margaret. Mrs. Grundy whispered in
one ear that she had already been in
discreet and It. was her duty to drop
the young man forever. Her sense of
fairness 'whispered ; in the other ear
that she owed him something for his
courtesy.
As they gathered up their traps to
disembark it was quite evident that
the young man was not giving him
self any anxiety over the situation. He
took her checks. - He even accepted
Pedro as a matter of . course. He led
the way to a hansom without asking
her so much as where she was going.
When she and Pedro were settled in
the vehicle the young man stood with
one. foot on the step.
"Will you. tell him to take me to the
Grand Central?" she asked.
"I " was going on to Newport for -a \
week, but I think I'll stop off .af
Rye." Margaret's glance fell and a.
slight flush spread over her face. The
young man's lips twitched- Â¦
"I think you need me there â to let
you know whether your hat Is : on
straight."
Then they both looked at each other
and laughed, and Pedro, In sympathy,
pounded the floor of the hansom wtth
bis taiL It is so stfod to be young!
Margaret was speechless, not sore
whether ehÂ© was glad or sorry. Was.
the young man trying to kidnap her,
or was he a mind reader? Sha wascer-'
tain she had dropped no hint as to her
destination. - . . "
"You see, I knew, you an th* time.
Yon are Margaret Trenton, aid you

at Rye Beach. I saw your .cams . oh

"Yes, but Etta! How do you knd:* '

"Oh, she's my cousin. It* was you

"Oh!" said Margaret, feeling some
how that there was nothing else to. bej
said.
"I have already dono no," said tha
young man placidly, and without hesi
tation he sprang Into tha hansom and
sat down beside her. v Â¦
An odious woman, lolling in a pat
ent rocker, emiled at her, but. it was
a pitying smile: Not for the world
would Margaret have asked that wo
man what was wrongs And a woman
wbo wore a lace net dress to travel in

(\/\ there was something wrong.
I < I A sense of the unfltness of
: _X things had been growing upon
h*r for full fifteen minutes. Seated In
the'eorner of a big divan on the Albany
day boat, she had gradually wakened
to. the realization that no matter who
passed by glances furtive and open
had been, cast In her direction.
Not that this was an unusual atten
tion for Margaret to receive. Glances
of â¢ admiration had followed her ever
rince she had passed from spindling
girlhood Into glorious young woman
hood. But these glances were differ
ent. - The expression in the eyes of the
women said quite clearly. "Thank
heavens I am not as you are." The
admiration in the eyes of men was
mixed unmistakably with pity.
Margaret reached blindly in the dl
rectic-n of her hat. The little bend In
the back was squarely above the coil
et the nape of her neck.- Perhaps it
had slipped too far back. She raised
her hand and felt of her pompadour.
She knew by touch that there was Just
enough hair enowing In the front- It
might be soot on the tip of her nose.
She drew forth her hftfidkerchief and
dabbed the tip of that member, but no
spot showed on the cambric Then
she tried her chin and her cheek bones
with the same- result.
if my hat was crooked or I had soot
on my nose' or my skirt and blouse
had parted company. Will you please
tell me what is the matter?"
The young man tried not to give
way to the mirth which was welling
up within him, and looked over her
critically.
"Well," he said Judiciously, "I can't
see anything wrong except that the
thing you. wear for a collar seems to
have slid around. Does the bow be
long under your left ear?"
Margaret clutched at the offending
bit of ribbon.
"My stock! I never thought of
that."
She oulled the bit of embroidered
linen till the bow was poised, ' with
outspread, saucy wings, directly under
her chin.
"Now, -is that right?" she asked,
looking up into her human mirror. . Â¦'
"Correct and trim as you please,"
he said reassuringly, and. watched her
while she fastened the unruly stock
with a tiny pearl-headed pin..
"You wouldn't believe what a mis
erable half hour I have put in. I
know now that odious old cat in the
patent rocker had grinned afresh each
time my stock sprung a fresh notch.
Isn't it funny that women can't show
a little Christian courtesy to each
other?"
' "Well," said the young chap
thoughtfully, "I'm sorry. I didn't get
here half an hour sooner. I might
have saved ; you some-â erâ trifling
discomfort." ,- "Â¦*;*Â«;-; i.^0;V. ;rv.i": â¢:,- ,.
But that .wasn't what his eves said

She was ready to call herself names
for having declined, with thanks, the
vanity bag her brother Dick had want
ed to give her on her birthday. She had
taken a new collar for Pedro. Poor
Pedro, grieving in the baggage-room in
the hold at this moment. What wouldn't
she give now for the tiny mirror re
posing in the rejected vanity bag?
Just then a young man loomed up on
her gloomy mental horizon. The boat
had made a landing at one of those
email towns from which tourists
reached the Catskills. The young man
looked exceedingly cheerful and harm
less. Margaret decided on this the In
stant her troubled glance met his. His
eyes were the sort to create a feeling of
trust. He was goodrlooking. but Mar
garet instantly decided that' he couldn't
be blamed for that. Anyhow, . he â¢ was
looking for somebody, and she became

another woman what had happened.
By the time Margaret had reached
this conclusion she was actually per
spiring with nervousness. She was
not a girl whose thoughts ran entire
ly on dress and appearance, but she
viewed with scorn the ungroomed
woman. And at this moment she was
morally certain that her grooming had
slipped a cog. She reviled the man
agement of the boat line which did not
panel its salon with mirrors, but not
for worlds would she have walked the
length of that salon to a dressing
room. She preferred to sit in the lime
light of the restless passengers to run
ning the gauntlet of the lounging pas-
"I am tremendously glad to be of ser
vice to any lady in distress. What par
ticular form of distress has overtaken
you?" .
Margaret looked straight into hia
trust-inspiring eyes, and her own
danced. --'.-â¢;

The young manÂ« accepted the un
spoken Invitation with alacrity. He
stood before her, hat in hand.
"Awfully good of you," he said, look-
Ing down at her frankly. "I didn't rec
ognize you at. first. You've changed
quite* a bit since you had that last
picture taken."
Margaret gasped. She had thought
her own Impertinence quite impossible,
once the die was cast, but this young
man's nerve was monumental. She
lowered her voice so that the woman
in lace net could not hear what she
said.
"Sit down, please, and I'll explain. Of
course, you were not looking for me, I
know that. But youâ er â play the part
much better than I could. I was in
such trouble and I just had to speak

with a nod of invitation and deliber
ately drew her skirts to one side as if
to make room for him on the divan.
He listened a moment, then passed
on. The vagaries of the river were,
back, only to* rush with increased
vehemence around the end of the rap
idly growing obstruction.
The policeman passing back and
forth on Canal street heard no sound of
the labor going on. If he had been an
observant policeman he would have
noted an ever-changing tone in the vol
ume of sound roaring up from the
eddy belowthe dam. After a time
even he remarked on a certain obvious
phenomenon. :>â¢- >" ;
"Sure," said he, "now that's funny."
men passed down to him a short, heavy
timber. A third, plunging hia arms and
shoulders into the liquid, nailed it
home with heavy, inaudible strokes. As
though by magic a second timber
braced the first, bolted solidly through
sockets already cut for it. The work
ers moved on eight feet, then another
eight, then another. More men entered
the water to pass the timbers. A row
of heavy slanted Â¦ supports grew out
from the shoulder of the dam, dividing
the waters into long, arrow-shaped fur
rows of light. At 12:30 o'clock Tom
Clute was swept over the dam Into the
eddy. He swam ashore. Purdy took
his place.
When the supports had reached out
over... half of the river's span, and the
water'<N*as dotted with the shoulders of
men gracefully slanted against the cur
rent, Jimmy gave orders to begin plac
ing the flash-boards.. Heavy planks
were at once slid across the supports,

hung wet clothes over-a big skeleton
framework butttjarpund,*a monster fire,
and ate a v doze*n~ eggsr apiece as ? a side

yarns and sang songs and asked ques

satisfactory replies. The crew that had
been laid off knew nothing.' It sup

told It to turn in and get a little more

A midnight Jimmy entered the big
tent quietly with a lantern, touching
each of the fresh men on the shoulder.
They arose without comment and fol
lowed him outside. There they were
given tools. Then the little band defiled
silently down river under the stars..
Jimmle led them, his hands deep in his
pockets, puffing white steam. clouds at
regular Intervals from his meerschaum
pipe. After twenty minutes they struck
the water works, then the boardwalk
of Canal street. The word passed back
for silence.' Near theÂ«Oriole factory
their leader suddenly dodged In behind'
the piles of sawed lumber, motioning
them in haste. A moment later a fat
and dignified officer passed, swinging .
his club. After the policeman had gone
Jlmmie again took up his march at the
head of a crew. of men now thoroughly
aroused .to the fact that. something un
usual was afoot.
Soon a faint roar lifted the night si
lence. They crossed Fairbanks street,
and a moment after stood at one end
of the power dam.
The long, smooth water shot over
like fluid steel, silent and inevitable,
mirroring distorted flashes that were
the stars. Below, it broke In white tur
moil, shouting defiance at the calm vel- j
vet rush above. Ten seconds later the
current was broken. A man, his heels
caught against the combing, midleg in
water, , was braced back at the exact
angle to withstand the rush. Two other
The logs during the winter had
been piled in the bed of the stream.
When Daly had quite finished his
remarks Jimmy got up and went out
without a word. Two days later he
and. Eixtv men were breaking rollways
forty-five miles up stream.
. Jimmy knew as well as Daly that
the latter had given him a hard task.
Twenty days was too brief a time.
However, that was none of his busi
ness.
Well, that was Jimmy. He looked al
ways the fame.- His hair, thick and
black, grew low on his forehead; his
beard, thick and black, mounted over
the ridge of his cheek bones; and his
eyebrows, thick and black, extended in
an uninterrupted straight line from one
temple to the other. Whatever his
small, compact, muscular body might
be -doing, the mask of his black and
white imperturbability remained al
ways unchanged. Generally he sat
clasping one knee, staring directly in
front of him. and puffing regularly on a
"meerschaum" pipe he had earned by
saving the tags of Spearhead tobacco.
Whatever you paid to him sank with
out splash into this almost primal calm
and. was lost- jo view forever. Perhaps
after a time ' he might do something
about it, but 'always without explana
tion, calmly, with the lofty inevitabil
ity of fate. In fact, he never explained
hirr.self even to his employers.
Daly Ewung his bulk back and forth
in the office chair. Jimmy sat bolt up
right, his black hat pendent between
his knees.
â¢ "I went you" to take charge of the
driving crew, Jimmy," said the big
man. "I want you to drive those logs
down to our boom as fast as you- can.
I give you about twenty days. It
ought to be done in that. Sanders will
keep time for you and Merrill will
cook. Tou can get a crew from the
East Branch, where the drive is just
â¢ver.**
Jimmy was a small man, changeless
as the Egyptian Sphinx. A number of
years ago a French comic journal pub
lished a series of sketches supposed to
represent the Shah of Persia influenced
by various emotions. Under each was
an appropriate label, such as surprise.
Brief, anger, or astonishment. The por
traits were identically alike and uni
formly impassive.
> * BEY orders If you break own-
I j ers." is a good motto, but a
\J really efficient river boss
knows a better. It runs,
"Get the logs out; get them out peace
ably if you can. but get them out." He
needs no instructions from headquar
ters to .tell him how to live up to this
rule. That might involve headquarters.
Jimmy was such a river boss. There
fore when Mr. Daly of the firm of Mor
rison & Daly unexpectedly found him
self contracted to deliver 5,000,000 feet
of logs at a certain date, and the logs
an impossible . number of miles up
stream, he called in Jimmy.
They extended over three mils of roll
ways. Jimmy and his crew began at
the down-stream end to tumble the
big piles Into the current. Sometimes
only two or three of the logs would
rattle down; at others the whole deck
would bulge outward, hover for a mo
ment and roar into the stream like
grain from an elevator.
Shortly the narrows below the roll
ways jammed. Twelve men were de
tailed as the "jam crew." Their busi
ness was to keep the .stream free in
order that the constantly increasing
supply from the rollways might not
fill up the river. It was not an easy
business, nor very safe.
As the "jam" strung out over more
and more of the river, the jam crew
was constantly recruited from the
men on the rollways. Thus some of
the logs, a very few, the luckiest,
drifted into the dam pond at Grand
Rapids within a few days; the bulk
jammed and broke, and jammed again
at a Doint a few miles below the roll
ways, while a large proportion
stranded, plugged, caught and tangled
at the very rollways themselves.
Jimmy had permitted himself two
days In which to break out of the roll
ways. It was done in two. Then the
"rear" r.as started. Men in the rear
crew had to see that every last log
got into the current and stayed there.
When the jam broke the middle of it
shot downstream in a most spectac
ular fashion, but along- the banks
"winged out" distressingly. Some
times the heavy sticks of timber had
been forced right out on the dry land.
The rear crew lifted them back. When
an obstinate log grounded they
jumped cheerfully Into the water â
with the rotten ice swirling around
them â and pried the thing off the bot
tom. Between times they stood up
right on single unstable logs and
pushed mightily with poles while the
ice water sucked in and out of their
spiked river boots.
As for the compensations, natural
ly there was a good dead of rivalry
as to which wing should advance the
fastest; and one experiences a certain
physical thrill in venturing under
thirty feet of jammed logs for the sole
purpose of teasing the whole mass to
cascade down on one; or of shooting
a rapid while standing upright on a
single timber. I believe, too. It is con
sidered a mighty honor to belong to
the rear crew. Still, the water Is cold
and the hours long, and you have to
sleep in tents.
It readily can be seen that the prog
ress of the rear measures the prog
ress of the drive. Some few logs in
the "jam" may run fifty miles a day â
and often do â but If the sacking has
gone slowly .at the rear the drive may
not have gained more than a thousand
yards. Therefore Jimmy stayed at the
rear.
Jimmy was a mighty good riverman.
Of course he had nerve and could do
anything with a log and a peevie and
would fight at the drop of the hat â
any "bully boy" would qualify 'thereâ

the clock in Plerce's tower struck' two.
Jimmy and his men, Â¦ having- thns
raised the level of the dam a good three

A heavy grumbling issued front, tfca

Of course the affair,' from a, river
driver's standpoint, at once becarna'ex

twenty were aroused . to astounded
drowsiness. By three, just as the dawn
was beginning to streak* the east, the
regular clink, clank, click of the peevies
proclaimed that due advantage of the
high water was being seized. From then
until six was a matter of three hours
more. ..' .â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦: Â¦Â¦'. '
A great deal can be accomplished in
three hours with flood water. Tha last
little jam "pulled" just about tha time
the first citizen of the West Side dis
covered that his cellar was full, of
water. When that startled freeman
opened up the front door to see what
was up he uttered a tremendous ejacu
lation; and so, shortly, came to the
construction of a raft. Â¦â¢
Well, the newspapers got otxt: extras
with scare heads abaut "Outrages'* and
"High-Handed Lawlessness"; and fac~
tory owners by the canals raised up
their voices in bitterness over flooded
flrerooms; and property owners of pÂ«x
ishable cellar goods howled of damage
suits; and the ordinary citizen took, .to
bailing out the hollow places . of his
domain. Toward 9 o'clockâ after the"
first excitement had died and the Cash
boards had been Indignantly, yanlsed
from their illegal placesâ a squad oi
police went out to hunt up the. malB^
factor. The latter they discovered on
a boom pole directing the sluicing.
From this position he declined to stir.
One fat policeman ventured a toppling
yard or so on the floating timber, threw
his shaky hands aloft and -with". a
mighty effort regained the shore, â¢whei'o
he sat down panting. ; ? !
"Why, It'll take you a week to get
her over those infernal shallows," he
concluded. "You've got to get more
men, Jimmy."
"'I've tried," answered the boss.
"They ain't no more men to be had."
"Suffering Moses!" groaned the
owner. "It means the loss of a $50,000
contract to me. You needn't tell me.
I've been on the river all my life. I
know you can't get them off inside of
a week."
"I'll have 'em off to-morrow morn
ing, but it'll cost a little something,"
asserted Jimmy calmly. Daly stared
to sue if the man was not crazy. Then
he retired In disgust to the city, where
he began to adjust his ideas to a loss
on his contract.
At sundown the rear crew quit Â¦work,
and swarmed to the white encampment
but he also had judgment. He knew
how to use the water, how to recog
nize the- key. log of jams, where to place
his men â jn short, he could get out the
logs.
Now Jimmy also knew the river from
one end to the other, so he had ar
ranged in his mind a sort of schedule
for the twenty days. Forty-eight hours
for. the rollways; a day and a half for
the upper rapid; three days Into the
dam pond; one day to sluice the drive
through the dam; three days to the
crossing, and so on. If , everything
went well he could do It, but there
could be no hitches in the programme.
Even from this imperfect fragment
of the schedule the inexperienced might
imagine that Jimmy had allowed an
altogether disproportionate time to
cover the mile or so from the upper
rapid to the dam pond. As it turned
out, however, he found' out he had not
allowed enough, for at this point the
river was peculiar and very trying.
The backwater of the dam extended
upstream half a mile; then occurred a
rise of five feet to the mile, down the
slope of which the water whirled and
tumbled, only to spread out over a
broad fan of gravel shallows. These
shallows did the business. When the
logs had bumped through the tribula
tions of the rapid, they seemed to in
sist obstinately on resting in the shal
lows, like a lot of wearied cattle.
The rear crew had to wade in. They
heaved and pried and pushed industri
ously, and at the end of it had the sat-'
isfaction of seeing a "single log slide
reluctantly into the current. Sometimes
a dozen- of them would clamp their
peevies on either side and by sheer
brute force carry the stick to deep
water. 'When you reflect that there
were oveÂ§40,000 pieces In the drive and
that a good 50 per cent of them balked
below the rapids, you can see that the
rear crew had its work cut out for it.
Jimmy's allotted three days were al
most gone and his job had not ad
\anced beyond the third of completion.
McGann, the sluice boss, did a. little
figuring.
"She'll hang over thim twinty days,"
he confided to Jimmy. "Shure!"
Jimmy replied not a word, but puffed
piston-like smoke from his pipe. Mc-
Gann shrugged in Celtic despair.
But the little man had been figuring,
too, and his arrangements were more
elaborate and more nearly completed
than McGann suspected. That very
morning he sauntered leisurely out over
the rear logs, his hands in his pock
ets. Every once In a while he stopped
to utter a few low-voiced comments to
one or another of the men. The per
son addressed first looked extremely
astonished, then shouldered hia peevie
and started for camp, leaving the di
minished rear crew a prey to curiosity.
Soon the word went about: "Day and
night work," they whispered, though
it was a little difficult to see the differ
ence in ultimate effectiveness between
half a crew working all the time and
a whole crew working half the time.
About this stage Daly began to
worry. He took the train to Grand
Rapids, anxiety written deep in. his
brows. When he saw the little inade
quate crew pecking In a futile fashion
at the logs winged out over the shal
lows, swore fervidly and sought
Jimmy.
Jimmy appeared calm.
"We'll get 'em out all right, Mr.
Daly," said he.
"Get 'em out!" growled Daly. "Sure!
But when? We ain't got all summer
this season. Those logs have got to
hit our booms in fourteen days or
they're no good to us!"
"You'll have 'em," assured Jimmy.
Such talk made Daly tired, .and he
said so.

There is no space here to go into the
question of Â¦ Morley's religionâ or lack

have decided that musical instruments
must no longer play a part in their
services. Carnegie has been lavish in
his generosity toward many of the
churches; in fact, it is said he has.
never refused an application for a new
organ from any sect. Carnegie organs,
if not so conspicuously dotted ovar
the British Isles as Carnegie libraries,
are not less numerous. A large num
ber of applications Â¦ for â¢ organs were
treated by the generous Skibo laird
as confidential, with the result that
there are scores of churches through
out the country provided with beau
tiful organs while only Carnegie and
the minister in charge know who pre-.

now be changed and Morrison is go

VANPERBILT IN IRELAND. ;
LONDON", Oct. 1.â The Duchess* o?
Manchester, not ' content with merely
becoming a resident of Ireland, la bent
on captivating the Irish heart by Iden
tifying herself with the revival of tha
ancient Irish customs â¢ and pastimes
now being assiduously cultivated by
the Gaelic League: 'â¢":;'
About twelve months ago, while stay
ing at Tanderagee, . her. place in the
North of Ireland, she was present at
a local entertainment for "the. ben'eflt .
of one of the hospitals in the district.
For the first time she witnessed Irish
step-dancing.â a quartet of girls doing
what is known as the four-hand feel.
The Duchess was s6 interested that sh(Â»"
sent for the young women and asked
them how long It had taken them to.
learn this form of dancing. The mafda,
who did not claim to be perfect., told
her that any woman wfth ordinary
skill would be able to do> as they .did
in six months under proper tuition and
with a fair share of practice. There
and then she engaged a teacher,. -Miss
O'Connor, and at Tanderagee . Castle
the Duchess had her first- lesson in
Irish step-dancing. For a time .Miss
O'Connor traveled with, her wherever
she went, and at the .end o.t six.rnoriths
she had made such progress with her
pupil that she .was able to -.leave: n er

INTENDED FOR THE CHURCH.
It is rather curious to recall that
John Morley, who, when he first sought
to enter public life, was fiercely as
sailed as an atheist, . and. denounced,
from the pulpit because he once spelled
God, Christ and the Holy Ghost with
out the initial capitals, was designed
by his father, a Blackburn surgeon, for
the church. But in his Oxford days he
fell under the influence of John Stuart
Mill's teachings, and for him. there
after, the church was impossible. It
was from Mill's works he imbibed that
passion for justice which has always
distinguished him.
Coming to London in the early six
ties, when just over twenty, he sought
to make a living by his pen, and went
through the usual Grub street experi
ence of young literary aspirants, at
one time having to 6ell some of his be
loved books to keep the wolf from the
door. But hard times did not last long
with him. His powers of logical rea
soning, combined with the charm of his
literary style, soon gained him recogni
1 tlon, and he was invited to join the
band of brilliant young men who were
fighting the early battles of the Satur
day Review. The late Lord Salisbury,
Sir William Harcourt and other men
who subsequently helped make history,
were among his associates on the Sat
urday Reviler, as it soon came to be
called. In 1867, when only twenty-nine,
he was made editor of the Fortnightly
Review, a position which has. been
called the Blue Ribbon* of the English
literary world. For fifteen .years . he
controlled its destinies and meanwhile
â¢wrote some of his best known books.
Then he entered , the realm of daily
journalism, and for three years was ed
itor of the Pall Mall Gazette, with W.
T. Stead as his assistant.
It was rather hard on Stead to have

So this interesting pair will set forth
in a few days, after having talked it
ail over at Skibo Castle.
And the Right Hon. John Morley will
be -worth seeing. He comes nearer than
any one else to being the successor of
his old friend Gladstone, as England's
most distinguished plain citizen, part
ly because of his great name as a man
of letters and partly because of the
height and general remoteness of the
political pinnacle on which he sits,
looking down rather, sadly on the
>quabb!ing and muddling that goes
on below him.
There was a shrewd and sympathetic
picture of John Morley in Israel Zang
wijrs novel, "The Mantle of Elijah,"
of which the statesman who is about
to visit the United States for the first
. time was undoubtedly the hero. There
in is given some idea of the only man

It is not to Morley's profound schol
arship, his rare intellectual gifts, his
brilliant literary achievements or his
statesmanship that he owes the unique
jwsition which he occupies in public
eFteem here. People may differ from
â¢him on matters nf opinion â the majori

-hair's /breadth, from what he believes
' to; tie ; the right course.
.:^Otih;is; implacable rectitude he fur
rished a 'striking example early in his
parliamentary career. In the g-eneral
election of 1SS5 â he had then been only
.three years in the House â he stood for
Newcastle.-. Organized labor had there
declared in favor of the eight hour day
and insisted that their Parliamentary
representative should adopt the same
view. But Morley believed that .com
pulsory limitation of the hours of la
bor by legislative action was Inimical
to the interests of the workingman. He
declined to obey the mandate, even if
It cost him his seat â and it very nearly
did."
Accepting office in Gladstone's new
ministry as Chief Secretary for Ire
land he was faced with the necessity,
in accordance with English law, of
again appealing to his constituency for
election. Opposition to him on account
of his attitude on the eight hour ques
â¢ tion was stronger than ever. The
temptation to temporize would have
been irresistible with most men now
in public life. His defeat would have
administered & staggering blow to
Gladstone's government and. might
have involved its collapse. Apart from
all consideration of his own political
future, on seemingly high patriotic
grounds be might have found plausible
reasons for tempering with his con
victions. But such a course never
seemed to have suggested itself to his
mind.
SCORES ANOTHER VICTORY.
He went down to Newcastle, nailed
his colors with'nrmer hand to the mast,
fought the fight over again and won it
a?ain by a greatly increased majority.
It was, by the way, Gladstone's se
lection, of Morley as Irish Secretary
v.hich first caused a personal estrange
ment between the Grand Old Man and
Chamberlain, producing a rift within
the lute that, quickly widening, made
the music of their friendship mute..
â¢The pushful Birmingham member had
* xpected the office himself.
In. private life Morley is described as
one of the most genial of hosts and cor
dial and delightful companions. But one
thing he lacks which marks him as a
man apart from .most lot his fellows.
He has no amusements. From his youth
up only intellectual pleasures have ap
pealed to him. He revels in long walks
aqross'ihe hills, or solitary meditations
in country lanes. Still more does he
enjoy a good book and a shady seat
in some quiet garden. He seldom goes
to the theater. His one relaxation is
music, . of which, like Balfour, he is
passionately fond.
Whilfc to the world at large he ap
pears as the embodiment of hard, cold
intellect, he is as tender with animals
as if he were a believer in metempsy
chosis. At one time when living in

went more or less in awe of him
When the thundercloud gathered in hi?

But we all liked him, and for my par.
I had never worked with any one be
lore with whom comradeship 'was e.
once such a pleasure and such a'stimu
Jant." . Â¦
' MAIDEN SPEECH A FAILURE.
Morley was only 27 when he first
tried to enter Parliamentâ and met
with crushing defeat. Many years he
waited before trying again, and it wa3
not until he was 46 that he found a
constituency with sufficient faith in
him to elect him. His career in the
House of Commons has furnished a .
striking exception to the rule that only
those who enter it in their young man
hood can achieve high Parliamentary
renown. But his maiden speech was a"
failure. It was carefully prepared," full
of weighty matter, and "read , beauti
fully, but as ,he , painfully stumbled
through it, with parched tongue and
blanched face, it fell flat. It seemed,
to his friends that the disciple was
destined to repeat the tragic Parlia
mentary failure of 'his master, 'John
Stuart Mill.
The position that he. has. long: held as .
one of the ablest speakers in the House
of Commons * was acquired by slow,
dogged effort He always had it in
him, but. for several sessions could not
get it out. As a platform orator, he
now shines even more than as a Par
liamentary debater. But it was some
years before he mastered that art by
discarding carefully prepared addresses
and letting himself go, trusting to the
"fire in his belly," to use a favorite
Carlylean phrase of his. .
It Is only a great man that can win
the friendship of great men, and many
great men have been numbered among
John Morley*3 friends. The intimate
relations that existed between him and
that apostle of sweetness and Hght %
Matthew Arnold, are well khown % His*
biography of Gladstone is a monument
to another friendship. But among, all
his friends,', the' one who exercised the
most beneficent influence over him,
" when his mind was still. in the forma
tive period, is, as he has -acknowledged,
George Meredith, the novelist. It was
Meredith, more than any other, who
took him out of himself and awoke in
him that feeling for nature which has

that It was at the suggestion' of Mme:
Emilia Tojetti, president of the mUSlc

admirable little collection, largely: con
tributed to by the same phllanthropis
hand, was * got . together. Opera,
naturally, here, was most Importantly
represented, but orchestral and piano
literature are both In satisfactory avi-.
dence. The year has brought majsy'
additions to the list. If not so many

the character of the additions. is not
ably worthy. There is not a dis
pensable page In the collection. The
Mendelssohn, Bach and Beethoven ac
quisitions are in particular valuable.*
and the Mozart. Schumann, and -Schu-"
bert works Importantly augmented.
Orchestral compositions . are little in
evidence, and the solo literature" of
string, brass and woodwind Is- repre
sented by only two violin compositions.
Herein is where the philanthropist has
been idle. Indubitably there are here
as everywhere else private libraries-:-.
I have three in mind â tha,t have
fallen into disuse. Commonly these col
lections are of orchestral and con
certed music, but, of course, include
all varieties of musical expression/
Sentiment is sometimes the reason for
their retention, but quite as. frequently
it is* sheer thoughtlessness that. gives
them to the dust, and occasionally a.
pardonable puzzlement as to what to
do with them. Let me suggest the*
Public Library as their resting place.
It is at least as noble end as a-gcave
in a ptinid beetle's belly. Can one in
deed picture a worthier destiny for the"
best beloved music tomes?â giving" ai\
hour's forgetting to the weary, joy. to
the home, light to the studentâmay
hap, who knows, to a new Beethoven?
This and more is the gentle mission
of the free music library. "Many a
murder," Haweis says, among much?
foolishness, "has been committed upon
the piano." If not quite, this is near
ly enough true. ; It is no more possible
to play a Beethoven sonata and re
main angry than to watch yotirself'
slam a door six times and go on be
lieving that this is a cold, cold world:
The former process- is pleasanter !fqr
the neighbors, that is all. (Mostly,
that is.) But. compute therefore t j
prophylactic value of one Baethoven
sonata in the Public Library, and â
remember that disused collection.
TwÂ» names, those of Marjorle Ram
beau and W. J. Stack, in the cast of
"Captain Barrington" at the Majestic
this week, remind one of the new the
ater ea yet another avenue for local
talent. Perhaps of all recent local
Ftock companies that have turned out
F*t.!us the Frawleys lead. Many good
players egain have spoken their "car
riage waits, me Lord," at the Alca
zar. The Tivoll has added Alice Nell-
E*n and several other clever folk to
the Eineing list, and the Central has
furnished a famous black alpaca he
roine or two. Comes now the Ma
jestic with history to make and an
enviable opportunity to make it. The

to prove the point. In ths play the
hero, Horatio, is hung to a tree and
cut down by his mother. The print
represents him hanging to the tree, or.
rather to a kind of vine hung trellis.
True, the edition of the play is dated
1615; that leaves a period of thirty
years between the printing of this edi
tion and the first performance. Eut
supposing the trellis device to have
been used at the drama's first produc
tion, there is no reasonable doubt that
Shakespeare, the master craftsman,
availed himself of such and other ex
iEtent stage facilities.
I wonder if they have not a Tony
Lumpkln up at the Majestic in the per
son of Henry Stockbridge? His work
in "Captain Barrington" this week
Btrongly suggests the possibility. "Cap
tain Barrington" is to be remembered
also for a naive and charming moment
filled by Miss Linda . Arvidson. The
logic of her work was, however, at
fault. Did she mean to suggest willing
ness or unwillingness to endure Cap-
To the Majestic, then, the student
may now look for new opportunities,
with Mr. Stack as "a soldier," and Miss
Rambeau, with three lines, as pioneers.
Ifâ the if is large â the ambitions of
Mr. Bishop and Mr. Morosco are real
ized, the theater may become such a
dramatic incubator as was the old
California In its glorious days. But
McCulloughs and Barretts are scarce,
and the day may be distant. Mean
time, Mr. J. H. Gllmour and Miss Grace
Reals rule the roost, with earnestness
if without distinction, and Mr. Bishop
has put out a hand to the student.
The horse-stealer takes refuge ih the
Sheriffs hut on the Arizonan desert,
and discovers in him the man from
whom he won away his sweetheart
years ago. The Sheriff promises to help
him to escape, believing him innocent.
He is guilty, and confesses. Mr. Merle,
whose first attempt at play-writing is
"The Prairie Judgment," unfortunately
turns his Sheriff into a cad here. He
turns his former friend out into the
storm-swept desert.
Mr. Alden's portrait of the horse
stealer sticks In the memory. More
than cleverly, with the genuine tem
peramental quality, he gave the man's
innate rottenness, cowardice, his alter
nations of hope and fear as the Sheriff
decides his fate. The make-up was
excellent, and Mr. Alden's facial ex
pressions suggest the veteran. How
much the student owes to Mr. Gerson
one can hardly decide, ' but there Is
even notable material here, unless I
am egreglously mistaken.
While I am about it, Mr. Gerson ex
hibited another pupil that I am tempt
ed to prophesy for. . This is one Lester
Alden, who gave a Quite powerful lit
tle performance of a coward horse
stealÂ«r in a one-act playlet by Martin
V. Merle. The audience of a dramatic
school matinee is not of the most rev
erent. Poor Mr. Stack found that out
when he wandered on with an awkward
slit in his uniform. But even the
Fischer chorus girls, who sat in a fluffy
bunch and tittered about the. Stack
contretemps, were impressed by the
Alden portrait.
Margaret lies â remember the nams.
After all, though, it is not necessary;
it will find you out itself before very
long. Miss lies was the little nigger
brat, Sacharissa, and a truly delight
ful darky. The character was over
accented perhaps, but positively
beaming â¢with the sunny, careless ne
gro humor. Dialect, voice, gesture,
might have been handed up from old
Virginny, and Miss lies walked
through the part on her bare feet
without an atom of self-consciousness.
She is well worth watching.
â¢ â¢ â¢
effort* with the Majestic company have
not been bo to say brilliant- .
â¢ â¢ â¢ Â¦
But It Is the Majestic stage as out
let for budding genius, with Miss
Rambeau and Mr. Stack as represent
atives, that I wish to consider. The
last time I saw these young thespians
was at a dramatic school matinee,
given by_,the Paul Gerson school of
acting. Tardily I here subscribe to
having seen there some uncommonly
good work. It was, however, neither
Miss Rambeau's nor Mr. Stack's. Cu
riously ambitious was the latter's ef
fort, almost impertinently audacious.
Yet one could not but sympathize with
the exalted fashion of his ideal. Mr.
Stack, to begin with, committed a
translation of Hermann Suderman'a
"Fritzchen.V a powerful and brilliant
little play concerning itself -with Ger
man army life. Possibly the transla
tion was hasty, but its attempt to re
alize the German in the American
idiom was at times weirdly funny.
Weirdly funny, too, was Mr. Stack's
Richard-Mansfield-Prince-Karl Fritz,
the lieutenant. From makeup to a
hint of a lisp it was as faithful replica
of "Old Heidelberg's" hero as the
young actor could devise. Yet the
frank boldness of the imitation and
something: natively virile and auda
cious in the work aroused a certain
sympathy. The play itself is recom
mended Etrongly to those in search of
a powerful curtain raiser â the ama
teur absolutely barred.
Miss Rambeau appeared as Barbara
Reece in the little Southern sketch,
"Marse Van." One remembers chief
ly an overdone petulance, childishness,
with fair technical competence and
pleasing presence as Miss Rambeau's
contribution. The importance of
"Marse Van" came in with Miss Mar
garet lies.

sumed Monday. Trouble, however, is
Ftill expected, as a large element of the
strikers refuse to accept the action of
the majority.
Marseilles Strike Is Xearing the End.
California Is making a fine showing
of grapes in the Horticultural build-j
ing now, with San Joaquin and
Sacramento counties well at the front.
Some fine specimens have also been
sent from Los Angeles.* Fifty ' boxes
Scott Hendricks of National City,
president of the last class to graduate
from the University of California; Max
Thielen of Chlco, and Walter Burpee
of Oakland, all graduates of the Cali
fornia State University, are here on
their way to Harvard. As usual with
all visiting "U. C." men. they looked
up Robert Waring, also a University
of California graduate, - who is now
clerk at the California building, and
are being looked after by him.
Henry Hazard, ex-Mayor of Los An
geles, and Henry Braly, a millionaire
banker; Henry Hunsaker, a leading at
torney, and A. E.* Pomeroy, a large
real estate dealer, all of Los Angeles,
are visiting the Fair.
Californians here are hopeful that
their State will fare well in the mat
ter of awards. A grand prize for the
wine exhibit with several individual
gold medals is probable, and a grand
prize may be given the State's horti
cultural exhibits, with some medals for
a few of the counties. A gold medal
for the mining exhibit is expected. The
action of the group juries is not final,
however, and some of iheir awards
may be ruthlessly set aside.
The California commissioners did
something to advertise the State at a
banquet given a few aays ago by the
American mining jurors to the foreign
ers on that body. .The affair, which
was one of the most enjoyable of the
exposition, was given at the New York
building. Commissioners Wiggins and
Filcher supplied the wines and gave
each of the guests a souvenir â a cane
turned from the bark of the California
redwood, with yellow silk ribbons,
bearing the name "California" at
tached.
CALIFORNIA'S MIXING JUDGES.
E. H. Benjamin and Charles G. Yale
of San Francisco, who are members
of the mining jury, have been very
influential on that body as far as gold
mining is concerned, inasmuch as they
were the only members who were thor
oughly familiar, with the processes. It
is likely that several, pieces of ma
chinery exhibited by Californians will
receive medals because these gentle
men were able to show the workings
of them and explain their good quali
ties to the other members of the jury.
J. M. Long, who has been here since
April, will soon depart for San Fran
cisco and leave his son in charge here.
Mrs. Long will remain with their son
for some time. Mr. Long has been suf
fering from rheumatism and he feels
that he needs some San Francisco at
mosphere to straighten him out again.
Congressman Watson of Indiana,
who is chairman of the POstoffice Com
mittee of the House, was among the
prominent visitors' to the San Fran
cisco building this -week. He and his
friends were introduced to apricot and
orange brandy by Commissioner Er
win and these California-made cordials
met with instant favor from the Con
gressman. He said he would bring
Speaker Cannon, whom he Is accom
panying on a campaign tour, to the
San Francisco building, when "Uncle
Joe" visited the fair. Speaker Can
non's secretary, Mr. Busbee, was in
Congressman Watson's party.
W. H. Wills, assistant manager of
the St. Francis Hotel, and R. B. Hale
of the dry goods firm of that name, are
among the San Franciscans at the
fair.
Some tobacco sent here from Sonoma
County is attracting considerable at
tention. It was entered for competition
and the jurors who examined it said
it was of fine quality. It was produced
by David Hertze of Guerneville. There
is a section about Guerneville that is
said to be one of the only two places
in America that will produce the Ha
vana seed. The leaf shown here was
produced in that section. In all other
parts of the country where the Havana
tobacco was planted, it failed to pro
duce seed. The other place where the
Havana leaf can be grown successfully
is in Florida.
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING, WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS,
Oct. 1. â St. Louis' climate evidently
doesn't agree with wines and olive_oil.
The wine jury here found that scarcely
a bottle of vintage that had been on
exhibition at the Fair was "'sound."
California vintages suffered the same
as all the others and pretty nearly
every bottle opened was found to be
"off" in a greater or less degree. The
jury that passed on olive oil found
that it, too. had suffered. No pro
vision had been made by the exposi
tion officials to care for wines or oil.
There was no cellar in which exhib
itors could store these and other arti
cles that might be affected by expos
ure. As all suffered alike, no differ
ence was made on that score in the
matter of making awards.
One largo San Francisco wine firm,
thinking to put its goods before the
jury in first-class condition, sent a
special lot of wines by express Just
about the time the jury began its
labors. The washout that came at
such an unusual time delayed these
goods on the desert for several days
and in the heat they were "killed,"
as wine men say. When they reacned
St. Louis it was discovered at once
that they were unfit for competition
and Henrv Lachman had them with
drawn] The firm was communicated
with by telegraph and Frederick W.
Taylor, superintendent of Agriculture
and Horticulture at the fair, who has
jurisdiction in such matters, promised
that plenty of time would be given for
the firm to enter other wines.
FINE TOBACCO FliOM SOXOMA.
Representatives of the club will ap
pear at the next meeting of the Super
visors and urge their claims.
BOULDER CREEK, Oct. 1.â Impelled
by the threatened destruction of the
game and fish in this vicinity, local
sportsmen met in the Alpine parlors
Friday night and organized the Boulder
Creek Fish and Game Protective Asso
ciation. H. G. Hollenback was made
president and J. H. Aram secretary.
The continual disregard of the fish and
game laws and the evident incompe
tence or unwillingness of the local au
thorities to act in the matter practi
cally forced the formation of this
branch of the State association. So
rcany conflicting game and fish ordi
nances are now in force and proposed
that the sportsmen from San Francisco
?nd other places, who make this vicin
ity their hunting grounas, would have
to employ a lawyer and take a sur
veyor along to enjoy a hunting trip
â¢without endangering their freedom.
Resolutions were adopted condemn
ing the proposed extension of the quail
season to November 15; approving tne
plan to make the rabbit season con
current with the quail season and call-
Ing the attention of the Supervisors
to the open defiance of the law in the
maintenance of obstructions in the
river.

The report, which is of considerable
length, severely arraigns the short
sightedness of the Colombian represen
tatives that led to the misfortune
which befell Colombia after the nego
tiation at the Hay-Herran treaty fell
through- In conclusion the report sas-s:
*:We must admit that the United
-Suites Government haa granted to U3
by way of compensation in the Kay
ilerran treaty much more than We
had asked in the memorandum of our
Itlinister in Washington, which served
as a basis of that treaty. Comparing
these two documents tha Government
of the United States mlsht well point
to the generosity of its dealings with
Ccfombia and obtain trie public opin
ion of the civilized world, especially
that of the United States and France,
in considering as an indisputable fact
that the obstinacy of our Government,
v.as the only real obstacle to the con
struction of the canal by the United
States, which was the only agency ca
pable of bringing to a completion so
ceiossal and gigantic a. work."
NEW YORK, Oct. 1.â Copies have
just been received here of the report
to his Government of General Rafael
lieyes. now President of Colombia, who
was pent to this country on a special
diplomatic mis5ion in an attempt to
modify the action of the American
Government in regard to Colombian in
tc:csts in Panama. The mission was

For the past thirty years we have been showing photos and

I consider ED. PINAUD'S EAU DE QUININE the most refreshing
Hair Tcnic there is.
Crowned heads and the fashionable people the world over use and
recommend
ED. PINAUD'S Eau De Quinine Hair Tonic
WHY? BECAUSE we only state facts and make no claims
or show photos of people whose testimonials can be purchased.
IRRESPONSIBLE LONG-HAIRED WOMEN have applied to
us time and again, claiming they had used our Hair Tonic, and that
their testimonials were for sale, which we refused to consider.
ED. PINAUD'S HAIR TONIC EAU DE QUININE is.the
original Hair and Scalp- Tonic, sold all over the world, and on ac
count of its phenomenal success there are many substitutes, or so
called hair tonics, on the market, making all sorts of claims for the
sole purpose of promoting the sale of their goods, while we allow
the public to state what ED. PINAUD'S EAC DE QUININE has
done for them. Here is what we claim ED. PINAUD'S EAU DE
QUININE HAIR TONIC is guaranted to do; viz.: Cures dan-
druff, steps hair falling out, promotes its growth, and makes hair
beautiful, and puts the scalp in a healthy condition ; besides, it is a
toilet luxury, leaving a delightful perfume in the hair. These are
facts, and the many testimonials which we have published bear us
out in this statement, and to convince you we will send you a free
sample of Hair Tonic and a sample of our latest creation in per-
fume, including bottle of our celebrated Dentifrice upon receipt of

Bows, which were introduced in the
spring as a passing fad, are in great
favor for fall and winter. They appear
everywhere. Three or four tiny, smart
bows grace the front of the pointed
Birdie. They are used for catching up
a ruffle or for holding a ruche. Now
and then a skirt panel of bows attracts
the eye. The smarter the bow the
smarter the effect.

; This effort in behalf of a second peace conference has a signifi
cance aside from that inherent in its nature. The readiness with
which the European councils give ear to this suggestion from Wash
ington is but another manifestation of the strength that is ours in
the diplomatic concert of the nations. This nation has found within
the last five years high place in the esteem of Old World diplomats.
To our foreign policy there is* now accredited full measure of respect,
of admiration even, by those who hold in their hands the threads
of international polity. Not only that, but of this tangled skein of
world affairs the United States holds what is rapidly becoming the
master thread.
Our long strife with Great Britain over the Alaskan boundary
has been settled in favor 01 the United States by an arbitration
tribunal. When the present war broke out it was from Washing
ton that the suggestion for the limitation of hostilities came and
Washington's programme was accepted by the powers. In the
Perdicaris affair our ends were successfully accomplished without
injury to France and with the unanimous approval of the other
European nations. From our Government came the first demand
that Russia revise^her ruling on coatraband â a demand that has
been met satisfactorily by the Czar's Ministers. Now President
Roosevelt's initiative in the direction of a peace conference finds
ready seconding by our European neighbors.
In the consideration of all the elements that have operated to
achieve this place of distinction for American diplomatic policy the
opinion of Europe itself has telling weight. In a contribution to
a recent number of the Review of Reviews, Louis E. Van Norman
gives a comprehensive review of the British and Continental con
ception of President Roosevelt as a strong figure in world politics.
"All over the Continent and in Great Britain," says Van Norman,
."the writer has heard the plainly outspoken opinion that the day
of the local politician as President of the United States has passed,
and that America has at" last evolved a man of international weight
and significance." Citations from political journals of France, Italy
and even hostile Germany record the unanimous impression that
in Roosevelt America finds its natural leader along the highway of
international relations. x
Our friends of the opposition who seek to combat Roosevelt's
genius for the comprehension and direction of world movements in
which the United States has a part and who raise the cry of
militarism, imperialism and executive temerity may find refutation
for their contentions in the record of foreign affairs during the years
of his incumbency. Those years have seen our country placed
higher in the respectful esteem of the powers than it has ever been.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has set on foot a movement look
ing to the summoning of a second peace conference at The
Hague, and to the inquiries that have been sent quietly to
the courts of the powers through our representatives favorable
answers are credited by the press to all the nations save Russia.
The initiative taken by the President and the Department of State
seems in a fair way to v be productive of a great good to the world's
peoples, for a congress of the powers devoted to the ways df peace,
called in this time of dire need, cannot but result in benefits more
lasting and of deeper import than those of the Czar's first gathering
at Holland's capital.

RULES FOR HUSBAND.
A woman, observes the Kansas City
World, may accept a man^in haste, but
man chooses his wife at leisure. It is
to be supposed that when a man asks
a woman to marry him he has decided
that he cannot live without her. If he
can't live without her it is certainly his
duty to do his best Â«to live with her.
This it not always so easy as it sounds.
Here are a tew simple rules for the
wise husband:
If your wife frowns at you, smile at
her.
If she smiles at you. laugh with her.
If she is angry, soothe her.
If she is gracious, thank her.
If she is wise, praise her.
If she is economical, commend her.
If she is extravagant, explain to
her. . .
If she sacrifices her pleasures for you,
be generous with her. . . : ..' -
If she is beautiful, appreciate her.
If she cooks well, compliment her. â¢
If she is lonely, stay at home with
her. . ... .
If she is tired, tend her. .
If she doubts you, be frank with her.'
If she grieves, be tender with her.
If she is hysterical, ignore her. '
If she is flighty, be firm with her.
If she deceives you, be harsh with
her.
If ehe is saucy, kiss her.
If she is good, adore her.
Li vine on Flirtation.
While there is no doubt v that men
understand the art of flirtation a great
deal b'etter than women ; it Is â¢ doubtful
whether they get quite as much enjoy
ment out of it as the latter do. A man
may, and generally does, get" excellent
sport for his pains, but he cannot live,
as so many women do, on flirtation. : ,A'

*""pHE Grand Jury, in its investigation of the frauds committed
| at the last primary election, seems to have found an appalling
â¢*â¢ condition of things. The primary election was formerly a sub
stitute for the primary mass meeting and for the club primaries. In
the mass meetings great disorders occurred. On some occasions
there were fist fights, bungstarter assaults and gun fights. These
disorders were grievous and added often to the criminal business
of the courts. They indisposed orderly citizens to taking any part
i:i primary politics.' The bosses and managers were always present
with a programme, resistance to which was sure to incur gross
personal abuse and often bodily harm. The system seemed to leave
primary politics entirely to the rough and criminal element.
To substitute this system came the primary vote by ballot.
But this made little improvement Jn matters. There was ballot
box stuffing, false impersonation and intimidation at the primary
polls. The decent part of the community despaired of* reform, and
had good color of excuse for snubbing the primary polls entirely
and leaving the fountain head of all our political processes to be
defiled by criminals and scoundrels. However, there was a rally for
the rescue, and the primary election law was passed, putting the pri
mary election under legal regulation and restriction, providing that
all parties should vote on the same day and in the same ballot-box,
under the supervision of the same legally appointed judges and clerks
of election. It also provided for the use of the regular register of
voters for the purposes of tally and identification.
There was every reason to believe ,that the operation of this
law would purge the primary process of the violence and crime that
had long made it the odium of our politics. It was believed that
the election officers would scrupulously obey their oath and see that
the law was strictly enforced and obeyed by all comers, and that
decent voters could approach the polls and discharge their civic
duty without intimidation or insult, and that false impersonation,
ballot stuffing and other frauds would cease. The revelations of
the last primary show that these expectations have not been real
ized. That there was no violence was evidently because it was not
necessary to effect the purpose of the violators of the law. Open
violence furnishes evidence against its -perpetrator, and this he
avoids when his corruption of the ballot can be effected by easier
and more secret means, in the use of which he can probably escape
exposure and punishment.
The Merchants' Association, made aware of the frauds, was
immediately alert to secure punishment of the guilty. Mr. Fairfax
Wheelan, with most commendable courage, appeared as witness
against one false impersonator, and procured the arrest of the man
he believed to be guilty. When the difficulty of securing direct
evidence is considered, it is no wonder that more arrests have not
been made. Whether or not conviction follow the prosecution of
this single case, bringing it to bar has had the effect of inducing an
examination of the incidents of the election. This investigation is
made by the Grand Jury and results in the discovery that in many
districts the fraudulent ballots exceeded the lawful ones. In other
districts the fraudulent votes were 40 to 60 per cent of the whole,
and the total number was sufficient to void or impair the legality
of the whole result.
When it is remembered that the primary and general elections
are under exactly the same legal regulation and restriction, with the
same source of appointment and authority for the election judges
and clerks, it is disquieting to know that the same frauds or greater
committed at the primary may b& repeated at the general election.
For this reason it becomes of first importance that the Mer
chants' Association be in every proper way aided by the citizens and
supported by the officers of the law. Mr. Wheelan stands at this
moment the representative of public decency and of the law which
is intended to protect the purity of the ballot. His efforts may fail
to secure conviction, but the resulting publicity and the revelations
of the Grand Jury will have the effect of inducing others to be as
watchful and as courageous as he. It will also direct a keener in
spection into the appointment of election officers, and 'on their part
a more careful attention to their duty.
THE PRIMARY FRAUDS.
A more obviously "morning" costume
consists of a shepherd's plaid skirt in
a soft woolen fabric, with taffetas pip
ing on the straps of the blouse. A belt
of green leather and touches of green
and black on the collar and cuff3 com
plete the scheme. With it is worn the
smartest of little Hack and white
toques, adorned with two pointed green
quills caught with a silver buckle.
Burnt orar.ee and rose colored vel
vet both look well with a shepherd*
plaid, and, indeed, there are very few
colors, except, of course, other shades
of grav and perhaps brown, that can
not be auite effectively used, with it.
The styles in hats are very simple,
a hat depending for its smartness on
the shade and color rather than the
trimming.
% As an every-day serviceable hat the
little toque is still the favorite. In dull
shades of red. made of beaver or vel
vet, it is most attractive.
For a larger hat the roll brim and
high crown are very popular, and a
blue felt, bound with dark green vel
vet and trimmed with a shaded breast-*
or plume, is exceedingly stylish.
For rainv days some sensible person
has invented a useful little flat cap.
You will be aulte surprised to find it
much more becoming than it looks and
is both reat and comfortable.
Shepherd's plaid and navy serge arÂ«
decidedly the favorite materials for
walking costumes. There has never
been a time -when these materials have
enjoyed a greater measure of popular
ity. A suit in a very lightweight tweed
in this mixture exactly realizes tha
ideal for the moment. The skirt put
into narrow knife pleats over the hips,,
the little loose coat with wide roll col
lar being untrimroed, opens to show
a waistcoat of pastel blue cloth beau
tifully embroidered in black and sil
ver.

UNCLE SAM: "NOT Good Enough for Me."
22Senator Proctor of Vermont, former?
Secretary of War, waa in Washington,
the . day General Corbin's report was
publish-ed. . Said he, with, a sarcastic
air
"I have never understood that af
fairs of the heart could be regulated
by any army edict. Marriages have
always- taken place in the army, and I
suppose they will continue. I nave not !

know of* them it does not 3eem pos
sible that they can prevail. Certainly
I know "of no disposition, among- legis
lators for the army to curtail the in
clination of young -officers to marry."
It is interesting to observe just
what a young man entering- the army
from West Point or from civil life re
ceives for serving his country. If he

a year, or 'lUdS a month. If he ia

the end of each five-year period of
service a3 a second lieutenant he gets
ac increase of $149 a year.
A first lieutenant, unnrounte^i. gets
51500 a year; a captain. $1500; a
major, 52300 : a. lieutenant cclcnel.
JSilOQ; a colonel, S230fr; a brigadier
general, S5500; a. major general.
J7300; a lieutenant general. $11, COtf.
Up to the grade of colonel there are
increases for longevity of service.
It has never been easy in the Amer
ican or any other army for two to live
on a tie tf tenant's, pay. In Germany
the giri who ia willing to marry an
come after marria^a will be sufficient
to support himself * and family and,
above ail. if he ia. to live on his pay
he should stats on honor that- he is
free from, d^bc Starting in. evert he
has m fighting chance, but starting in
debt he undertakes a well nigh, hope
less, task. Particularly will this prove
true if .he has frequent changes ,_of
stations, " when. aH th"e exDenses of
travel of . hi3 family have to be met
by. the officer himself."
So ti^ht is the muaale the President
has put on army officers inclined -to
discuss for publication any question,
political, military or commonplace,
that no of5cer can be found in Wash
ington willing to be QTioted on Gen
eral Corbla'3 report. . The muzzle

there" is no difficulty " Isi ascertaining
the trend of sentiment. Acting' Sec
retary Oliver of the "War Department
said:
"This i3 a question which I would
say was none of the "War Depart

to marry if he desires; the War De
partment has no authority to deny
him the privilege. Legislation by
Congress would be necessary to put
any such policy in force, and I think
it is safe to sa.y no one win. ever ad
vocate it in the Capital. I would like
to see ary one tell me not to marry
if I was an army officer and desired
to do so."

""That a bachelor officer is more
valuable to the serviee taa.11 a mar
ried officer does not follow, nor do I
wi3h to be understood as so saying,
but the married officer -i3 less valu
able if in marrying he has not exer
cised that prudence which should
govern all transactions in life. By
this I mean that he should by some
means, before assuming the respon

range MÂ» pecuniary affairs that the
worry and anxiety over the possible

General Corbin complains that the
views on army marriaxes which he Tv*Â«

misunderstood." Here is exactly what

many others belare us the inundation
month by month of vast hordes of
aliens from every country un
der heaven, the problem of seven mil
lions of the colored race absorbed into
the national system but not assimi
lated, the cleavage between capital and
labor itself, which In its ironclad or
ganization would deny to the individu
al his inalienable right to work fcr
whom he pleases and as long as he has
the mind; the determination to over
ride the law or evade it whenever it
interferes with private interest and
1 personal ambition in ail carts cf the
country alike; the lax and licentious
.theories that are creeping like a palsy
- c-^er the home "life of the nation and
. stealing every vestige of sanctity from
.the marriage, relation; i3 there not
enoug-h here to fill every true Ameri

tea times over the great heritage o*
..that glorious constitution which out of
thVaterm and stress of the,Revolution
ary War the mighty men. cf a former
and more religious day bequeathed to
us? â¢
- I -do not -believe that any coalition
of foreign states can balk America of
her destiny. This country, at unity in
itself, might calmly face a world in
, arms, nor care one jot while -all the
war lord* of the earth so furiously rage
tager**â " and jealous Emperor3 imagine
a vain thing. It '- not ten thousand
- enemies outside the gates, but th^ fpe?
! encamped within that we have need to
fear. It Ls the rift within the lute
that soon may make the rattsic mute.
.and the motto fcr every good man and
woman, called of God to live Ia these
critical day3. in this wondarful repub
lic, inheriting such a past, dowerei
with such incomparable resources, en
riched with greater possibilities of de
velopment than any other narfnn on
the face cf the earth. i3-to be found
in a letter written long ago- by a wise
man to seme friends at Rane : "Let
every man be subject to the higher
powers.'*
The "power" to which- we are subject
at present is **macey." and we seem as
a nation enable to think of anything
' higher. ""We are hypnotized," says
i BLshop- Spaulding- cf Peorta. by the
glare and glitter, the pomp and cir

incapable of a rational view of life.
We have caught the contagion cf the
' insanity that the richest nations are

, by the soul alon-* can any nation be
come great.
"Wealth getting has entered as an

refugees pouring in by myriads from
every part of the old world â while such
an invasion cf foreign thought and
feeling cannot fail to greatly modify
the ancient regime, it is conceivable
that from the wemb of the future a
new world Napoleon, or Apollyon (de
stroyer), may be hatched who on the
noodtide cf some terrific social convul
sion shall, by the sheer force of a
dominant personality, rise up as the
pcsitiTe incarnation cf American- im
perialism.
This I say is a distinctly possible
thing when one considers the rapid and '
continual "alienization" of our popu
lation.
How, for that matter, shall anything
be pronounced impossible in a Land
where such an excrescence as ilor
monism has, in half a century, become
one cf the ereat problems of the day,
and risen to the proportions of a na
tional menace?
Is there anything inconceivable
among future possibilities in a comma-,

the poise nous germa of an irreconcil

What rrvay not happen in a country
where power 13 more and more becom

oÂ«:rpo rations, while at the same time f
thÂ«r long slumbering intelligence of tha j
hi.sts of labor is waking up everywhere I
to strenuous protest against the con

Anything is able to happen la. a land.

storm temples of justice and incinerate

And so far it might not seem as though

were in any danger cf oein* justified.
Eut let us think a bit, and see whether
grave reasons do not exist to excite cur

Herbert Spencer was not talking at

I do not think it such a dimcult

Association held last week. Repre
sentatives of the Sierra Club and own
ers of timber lands were present, as
were also several members of the corp,s
of the United States Bureau of For
estry now engaged in investigations
in California under the co-operative
act, whereby the State and the United.
States Bureau of Forestry contributed
an equal mount for -the forest Investi
gations made during the last two sea
sons. t . " . . . t
A rough draft of a bill was presented
to the meeting, which was referred
to a special - committee consisting of
William â¢ Thomas, Arthur R. Briggs
and T. a Friedlander. with instruc
tions to request, co-operation of a com
mittee from the Sierra Club, and to
work jointly with the members of the
Federal corps. now conducting the for
estry Investigations In California.. â¢
The ' subject will be divided, in all
probability, under two headings: First;
the 'prevention of fires.- and, second,
the extinguishing of fires.
Some timber owners who were pres
ent at the meeting gave assurances of
Â¦their hearty co-operation. The r idea
was advanced that it should be made
obligatory by the State that. the own
ers of timber lands each year, after
the lumbering "operations are finished
and the first rains come, to burn, un
der careful supervision, the scallngs
and debris resulting from their opera
tions.
It has been demonstrated that burn
ing conducted as outlined would re
sult in no ' damage to the standing
growth, and, furthermore, would "not
engender the intense heat that arises
from a flrelstarting and burning during
the hot and dry spells of the late sum
mer. This heat causes the standing
trees themselves to burn and . pene
trates through the light soil and de
stroys .all the- forest Â¦ cover and even
the roots of the trees. ,

to report before October 15. ,

"While we believe that these abuses
should be corrected, we realize the fact
that the existing condition has become
a part of the industrial system of the
country, and that to radically disturb
it might be the cause of readjustment
that would bring loss and distress to
the Innocent. We therefore declare
ourselves in favor of a revision and a
gradual reduction of the tariff. The
Democratic party stands for progres
sive reform in this direction, which will
content itself largely In the first place
with gradually reducing the rates of
duty upon those- products which
are made in this. country and are sold
PART OF THE SYSTEM.
"The McKinley tariff was the result,
which, by its excessive duties, and tha
rise in prices occasioned thereby,
shocked the American people and cre
ated a revulsion that led to the Cleve
land election in 1S92. This was followed
by the enactment of the Wilson bill, a
conservative bill, whose duties, though
lower than the McKinley bill, were
higher than those of the original Mor
rill bill, with which the country was
content. Alleging that this bill was the
cause of the financial depression really
caused by a money famine, the Repub
lican party again met the issue, called
to its aid the trusts and combinations
then in process of formation, secured
from them an Immense campaign fund
unprecedented in political history and
then wrote In the laws of the country
the Dingley bill, whose provisions were
framed in the interests of these trust3
and combinations, with a view to pro
tect them from foreign competition,
thus enabling them. under the
shadow of the tariff wall, to suppress
the production of formidable competi
tors and to monopolize the markets of
the country.
"Such has been the history of tariff
legislation, from the moderately high
protection of the Morrill bill, which tha
Republicans themselves were seriously
proposing to reduce, to the exaggerated
and swollen protection of the Dingley
act In the- interests of monopoly and
combination. This shows the gradual
abandonment by the Republican party
of tha spirit of reform and the substi
tution for It of a policy dictated by
avarice and greed.
"Under existing conditions a larga
portion of our national revenue must
always bo secured from tariff duties,
and to the extent that they are levied
on foreign products they must tend to
ward the protecion of American Indus
tries; but we protest against the exag
gerated and swollen protection of tha
Republican party, which has had in
view not simply the difference In wages
at home and abroad and the protection
of infant Industries, but the building
up of great monopolies, protected,
against foreign competition by a tariff
wall unduly high, and destructive of all
domestic competition through the fa
vored control of transportation and
finance.

WASHINGTON, .Oct. 1.â Postmaster
General Payne's life to-night hangs in
the balance. Late in the afternoon he
had a sinking spell, and failed to rally
as quickly as heretofore from the stim
ulants administered. Although he was
reported as not so well, he began to re
spond to treatment, and an hour later
was said to be resting quietly.
Small hope, however, Is held out for
his recovery, and the members of the
family, who have been summoned to
the bedside, have been made to jealize
his true condition. At one time to-day
his pulse was barely perceptible. â¢
It developed to-night that several
times during the day Payne lost con
sciousness. That his condition is grave
in the extreme was evidenced by the
fact that the members of the family
kept closely to their apartments
throughout the evening. Drs. Ma

has gradually drawn the adventurous*

FOR RECOVERY
The State Department is especially
anxious to know whether Gurney was
a chronic violator of the Massachusetts
speed laws and whether there was any
thing in his conduct to show whether
he was unconsciously exceeding the
limit when the officers observed his
conduct. Instead of supplying the de
partment with facts, Governor Bates
and the other Massachusetts officials
have sent advice. It is generally be
lieved that the case is practically closed
as far as the department is concerned.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1.â State De
partment officials are much displeased
with the action of Governor Bates of
Massachusetts in making public his
letter concerning Third Secretary of
the British Embassy Gurney, who was
arrested for speeding his automobile.
The British Ambassador was mention
ed in the letter and the Governor inti
mated what action he thought the de
partment should take. Under no con
ditions would the department have
thought of sending such a letter to the
British Kmhaafgdpr^ hyLjt^ttiuiihÂ»patir.n
by Governor Bates amounts to practi
cally the same thing.
Acting Secretary Adee received a re
port to-day from the Department of
Justice on the Gurney case, but insuffi
cient information concerning the con
duct of the young secretary of the
British Embassy and the Massachu
setts officials was offered to make it
possible for the State Department to
take any action. Governor Bates has
been asked to make a complete report
on the incident.

That a third attempt had been made
to wreck the new battleship was
known to only a few men until to
day. The officers at jthe yard either
denied the story or else denied all
knowledge of it. But the particulars
of the latest attempt to injure the
great battleship were talked about by
the men and in that way they became
public.
That the hole was bored in the boat
by one of the workmen is certain, but
his motive in doing it is beyond the
comprehension of any one. It was on
the port side and must have been
done a very few days before the
launching. The hole was about one
inch in diameter and what is evidence
that it was done by a workman is the
fact that the person who did it knew
where the crib work was and bored
the hole at that place. The hole ex

was no evidence of it from the out

When the vessel plunged into the
waters of East River on Thurs
day there was in one of her
sides, below the water line, a hole
which had been bored with the inten

That the battleship was not seri

fact that the water-tight compart

their construction that no other | part
of the boat was injured.

The Democratic campaign in Califor
nia was inaugurated at -the Alhambra
Theater last night before a small audi
ence. United States Senator Francis G.
Newlands of Nevada was the principal
speaker at the mass-meeting:, which
was arranged by the local Bourbons.
His presentation of Democracy's views
of the issues of the campaign met
with the enthusiastic approval of his
fellow partisans.
Senator Newlands has been a strong
advocate of the principles of Bryan
since that twice-defeated candidate for
the Presidency first came into public
view. Bryan's principles, with the ex
ception of the silver question, Senator
Newlands found largely expressed in
the Democratic platform, inthe fram
ing of which Mr. Bry*an exercised all of
his Influence. In consequence* each of
the planks of the platform supplied
Senator Newlands a subject for discus
sion. '"...- " ~'"./,' : -

speaker and his views '"are strengthened
by the apparent sincerity that actuates
his argument. He was' introduced to
the audience by Joseph' S. Tobih.iwho
presided at the meeting.' 1 Mr. Tobin
took advantage of the occasion to ex
press a few of his views of the situa
tion. In part Mr. Tobin said:
"We have met" this evening In . dis
charge of a duty and to exercise a
privilege of a very sacred character.
From the days of old until the present
hour, the discharge of this duty' and
the exercise of this privilege has led to
war and bloodshed. "We are here to
play a small part in the choosing of
our leader, in deciding to whom we
shall trust the destinies of our nation
during the next four years. â¢ â¢
"About ten days ago our distinguish
ed fellow townsman', George A. Knight,
opened the Republican campaign.
There does not seem to be absolute
unanimity even among Republicans
themselves as to what constitutes their
policy upon particular topics. A rep
resentative Republican paper of this
city advises Mr. Knight to consult his
history as to .the Republican party's
attitude toward the Philippines and to
re-read President Roosevelt's speeches.
This article, was brought ' forth' by a
speech of ; Mr. Knight's devoted! to re
turning the Philippines. The paper at
tempts to set Mr. Knight right by say
ing that the Republican party's aim is
to fit the Filipinos for self-government.
"I might add that Mr. Knight might
not only find the knowledge of history
necessary when he goes to the Senate,
but might study, up on mechanics so
that he may understand the explana
tions of Mr. Platt and Mr. Depewon
the operations of machines. But-I want
to say, quoting from : Froude," that the
chief lesson history teaches 1b that free
nations cannot govern provinces.
Throw your tattered constitution to the
winds, Join your hands with' those of
bloody England in her provinces ; It
does not matter so long as you main
tain the price of wheat in California
or the price of tea for our merchants In
Manila.' '
"Other Republicans say, 'Wejnterid
to do what is right by the Filipinos,
but really, on the quiet, â¢ we intend â -,'
and there they stop. What they intend
to do they. will not disclose, because It
may. upset" their plans. If Â¦ they ; mean
right, - why don't they come out and
say, 'We intend to.treat the Filipinos
as we treated the Cubans'? Every day
and hour brings us news of new invest
ments by Americans in the Philippine
Islands; â¢ [ Â¦ , ; . ;
"The . principles of sympathy and
help for oppressed and struggling peo
ples are the very life of. our republic!
The Democratic party..Is , the party, of
oppressed humanity,, and our platform

DEMOCRATS OPEN CAMPAIGN IN CALIFORNIA WITH A MASS MEETING AT ALHAMBRA
UNITED STATES SENATOR FRANCIS G. NEWLANDS of Nevada opened the Democratic campaign in California at the A lhambra Theater last night. 'The lack of interest the local Bourbons are taking in the campaign was
manifested by the smallness of the audience and the absence of prominent adherents of the party was remarked. Senator New lands first discussed the issues of the campaign as he found them expressed in the Democratic plat
form and then attacked the administration of President Roosevelt, so far as it relates to international policy. His expression on the silver question, "which, he said, only rests in abeyance, to be revived should another money
famine take place, startled the conservative Democrats present and was the one point of general discussion at the conclusion of the meeting.'Resolution Passed Favoring'"Restric

Invention and industry of man, two

Republican contention that the effect

not upon quantity but upon quality,
and that a constantly increasing dollar
was more serviceable than a stable dol

The extraordinary production of

"The wealth of the country prac

"The Republican party in its plat

the work accomplished by that party
upon being restored to power. AH this
is asserted regardless of the fact that
the period of depression lasting from
1S93 to 1SS7 under Democratic adminis
tration had Its parallel in the depres
sion, xif 1873 to .1877 under Republican
administration, and that the depression
of 1893. to 1897 had its source in the pre
ceding Republican administration,
which was preparing to Issue bonds for
the relief of the Government only a few
weeks before the Democratic adminis

"I have no excuse to offer for the
mistakes of the Cleveland administra

instead of inaugurating Democratic
policies, to trade with the Republican
party for the establishment of a Re

pose entering upon the defense of
Cleveland or of his administration, but
I insist that the Republican policy in
augurated by the aid of this Demo

passage of the Dingley act brought no
favorable results, and that It was not

of money, â¢ and after the increased
production of- gold had commenced to
ease the money famine theretofore ex
isting, that the industries of this coun
try, agricultural as well as. manufac
turing, obtained relief. These new con
ditions were created not by Repub
lican policies but by nature, by discov
ery and the "Invention and industry 'of
man.
"The depression of 1873 to 1877 waa
broken only by the passage of the
Bland act, which gave the country a
moderate increase in basic money.
Again in, 1893 a money famine seized
the country, â¢ caused largely by the
withdrawal of gold to meet the de
mands of Austria and Russia, then go
ing apon a gold basis. The Republican
party sought to increase this famine by
the repeal of the Sherman act,' and with
the aid of President Cleveland accom
plished it.
- -"The-nmmcial policy* of 'the Republi
can-party has always been a blunder
ing one. the Civil War came at a time
<whe Â». the country had but a small sup
ply.of either gold or silver, owing to the
'State' bank note system, which tiad ex
isted for years and which had diverted
the gold and .silver production of our
country to other lands. The Republi
can party therefore devised the green
back and made It a legal tender for all
debts, public and private, except cus
toms dues. Having issued a large
amount of these during the war, the
wise thing to have done would have
beeji to gradually restore specie pay
ments by covering the greenbacks
with gold and silver produced from our
mines. But, no; the national banks
were determined to monopolize the cur
rency of the country, and silver was
demonetized at a time when it stood on
a par with gold, and this country took
the first step in the gradual process of
destroying the parity between gold and
silver.
"The greenbacks were destroyed in
order to make room for bank currency,
and the country eptered upon a finan
cial depression from 1873 to 1877, only
paralleled by that of 1893 to 1897, a pe
riod , during which mortgages were
changed into deeds and almost the en
tire property of the country was trans
ferred from the debtor to the creditor
class, thus., causing a concentration of
wealth unprecedented in our history
and only equaled by the subsequent
concentration by the depitssion of 18C3
to 1897.

abroad at less than domestic prices.
Revision will be effected in such a way
as to bring about a gradual-readjust
ment of the tariff and reformation. 'of
existing abuses without injury to the
labor of the country or to honest indus
tries now existing. Judge Parker, in
his letter of acceptance, expresses the
desire to accomplish a wise and bene
ficial reformation o v f the tariff without
creating, uncertainty or instability. Un
der such assurances no one need fe.ar
radical or disturbing^ readjustments. 1
"The Republican platform asserts
that new laws. Insuring responsible
publicity as to the operations of great
corporations, and providing additional
remedies for discrimination in freight
rates, have been 'passed by a Repub
lican Congress.' 7 'While power fs given
by the recent law to tho Secretary of
Commerce and Labor to make Investi
gation in such matters, yet publicity io
left to the discretion of the President of
the United States, who can' publish or
withhold, as he sees lit. A publicity en
forced by the law itself is tho only pub
licity the law should recognize, and it.
should not be permitted to any public
official, however high, to exercise dis
cretion as to whether the general pub
lic should be advised concerning the af
fairs of these great Industrial corpora
tions. Although nearly two years has
passed' since the act was passed, no
publicity has as yet been given, and
this suggests the fear. that the support
of the trusts and industrial combina
tions wills be 'insured- in- the coming elec
tion by- assurances, judiciously made,
as to the exercise ( of this discretionary
power. ; .
"In contrast with this fictitious Re
publican publicity stands the Demo
cratic plan of publicity urged by the
Democracy regarding the. sugar and
oil refineries and other industrial com
binations, and also the plan of
publicity proposed, by Senator Dubois
of Idaho as an "amendment to that
provision of the bill providing for a
permanent census, .which' gave the
power of examination into the affairs
of corporations. This amendment re
quired not only examination, but, also
full : information as to their receipts,
expenditures, capital stock, bonded in
debtedness, wages paid, taxes paid,
prices received at homeland abroad by
"This contention, fully set out in the
ieport of the Democratic minority of
the Ways and Means Committee, was
denied by ihe Republican majority and
was defeated by a rule passed by the
Republicans In the Honse preventing 1
the consideration of any amendments
to the repealing act save those sug
gested by the Republican majority of
the Ways and Means Committee, and
thus an opportunity was denied to the.
minority, even by an amendment, to
present their contention to the vote of
the American Congress.
"A reasonable and graduated tax.
similar to that imposed upon the sugar
and oil trusts by the war revenue act,
should be imposed upon the gross re- ;
celpts of all- great industrial combina
tions, and in connection with-it pub
licity should be required, with^a view to
securing such information as may be
â¢a guide to further legislation of a regu
lative and corrective character.
RATES AND PUBLICITY.
"The Democrats contended that the
tax imposed' by the war revenue act
of one-eighth of one per cent on the
gross receipts of sugar and oil refin
eries in excess of ?250,000, under
which one million dollars annually
was paid toward the expenses, of the
government by the . greatest trusts
known, .to modern timesâ the sugar
and the oil trusts, corporations which
have notoriously escaped proper taxa
tion, whether national, State or muni
cipal, should stand, and that it should
bo extended to all industrial corpora
tions having large annual gross re
ceipts, and that in connection with
such tax such corporations should be
compelled to make, statements tÂ© tho.
national government as to their re
ceipts, operating expenses, taxes, wages
paid, prices charged for their products
abroad as compared with domestic
prices, and other information neces-]
sary to secure full publicity of their
affairs.
enue taxes imposed upon commerce,
upon the exchanges and upon the fa
cilities for business in the shape of the
various stamp, taxes should be â¢ re
pealed,^ the taxes imposed by that act
upon ''aggregated wealth, such as upon
sugar and oil refineries, should be re
tained. "
'"Deprecating" as we do these vast
expansions of our army and 1 navy;
knowing that they involve increased
burdens to the people; that they are
not designed for the protection of our
own people, amply protected now by
the isolation of the seas, but that they
are really Intended in this new era
that is advancing upon us so rapidly
for -the suppression of the liberties of
our own people, we stand for Judge
"Parker because we know that the
great questions of domestic reform
which we have in contemplation will
never be taken up until this interna
tional swagger is ended.
' "If we elect Parker we will have in
the White House a thoroughly trained
man, experienced in politics as well as
in the law, a learned Judge and an
experienced publicist, who has: made
a study of the statesmanship of tho
DOMESTIC REFORM.
"The display of force made by the
present Republican executive which
prevented Colombia from landing her
troops upon her own soil for the sup
pression of, domestic disorder was a vio
lation of the rights of a friendly sover
eign, was a breach of the treaty be
tween the United States and Colombia,
under which the recognition of the sov
ereignty of Colombia over the isthmus
of Panama . was sacredly stipulated,
and was a breach of that provision of
the treaty which compelled the party
having a grievance to state its griev
ance and exhaust all other means of
redress before resorting to force.
"This display of force was an act of
war, even though the consequences
were bloodless, and constituted a viola
tion on the part of the President of the
constitution of the United States, which
gives to Congress alone the power to
declare war. This action, violatlve of
international law, of treaty obligation
and of the constitution of the United
States, was as unnecessary as It was
brutal. -Continued diplomatic'negotia
tion would have finally secured to our
Government the possession of the Pan
ama route in a manner entirely honor
able to the two contracting parties.
; "We are for Judge Parker because
he is against foreign wars needlessly
undertaken; because he is opposed to
: our dominating a people 7,000 miles
away and subjecting them to our un
controlled will; because he is for do
mestic development aa against foreign
exploitation, corrupting and expensive
as it is, and because "he Is an earnest
arid a true protector of the Demo
cratic faith as handed down to us
from Thomas Jefferson. And we
stand against Theodore Roosevelt,
the representative of an aggressive
mlltarlsm of a trticulent sensational
ism, swaggering throughout the world
under the 1 consciousness of a new
found power as the result of a little
war conducted with great sensation
alism against a weak and effete mon
archy. We stand against him because
he is reckless of constitutional re
straint and forgetful of our country's
real grandeur In the example of free
and . constitutional government it has
â¢ presented to the world.
COMMITTED ACT OF WAR.
"We stand for domestic development
as against foreign exploitation; we con
tend that the $600,000,000 spent in the
Philippines could have been spent to
very much greater advantage in the de
velopment of the West; that this coun
try, populated to-day by only 80,000,000
of people and capable of supporting
400.000.jOOO of people in comfort and prot,
perity, should absorb our entire ener
gies; that the policy of external expan
sion; while possibly adapted to a coun
try which has been built up and whose
population overcrowds its boundaries,
should not be applied to a country in
its infancy and capable of a growth
and development unsurpassed in the
history of the world. The Democratic
party stands for this domestic develop
ment. It declares that the irrigation
law was framed by a Democrat and
passed in the House of Representatives
against the opposition of almost- all the
Republican leaders by a vote the ma
jority of which was Democratic; and it
calls attention to this measure as an
evidence of the policy of domestic de
velopment contemplated by the Demo
cratic- party - should it be placed in
power. . â¢ , -,
"The Republican platform, states that
the great work of connecting the Pa
cific and Atlantic by a canal, at last be
gun, is due to the Republican party.
It is silent as to the method of secur
ing the route, which we insist was an
ignoble and dishonorable ending of a
long-continued agitation, conducted
mainly by distinguished Democratic
statesmen along the lines of honor and
progress.
"We protest against this policy not
only because it involves the rights and
liberty of the Filipino people, but also
because it involves a contradiction of
our entire theory of self-government,
organized upon the basic doctrine that
just governments derive their powers
from the consent of the governed and
that taxation and representation are
inseparable and because the denial of
this doctrine with reference to other
peoples will prove in the end a de
moralizing principle in our own. af
fording a justification for the sub
version of our own liberties and the
creation and use of arbitrary and des
potic . power in the government of
man. Â¦ :
"The Republican party entered
upon a war for freedom with reluc
tance and upon a war of conquest with
avidity, seeing in the latter an oppor
tunity for the exploitation by our
trusts and combines of peoples other
than our own.
such industrial combinations and all
other information necessary to .an un
derstanding: of their affairs.
"The Republican party boasts that
after it was restored to power it re
fused 'to palter longer with the mis
eries of Cuba. As a matter of fact,
it delaye'd decisive action until com
pelled by the vigorous demand of the
Democratic minority. But while the
Republican party was reluctant to
enter upon a war to secure peace, free
dom, order and prosperity to the
Cuban people, it was eager upon its
conclusion to enter upon a war of con
quest, spoliation and self-aggrandize
ment against the Filipino people, suf
fering equally with the Cuban people
from the oppression of Spain and
equally entitled to freedom and self
government. While less than $200,
000,000 was expended in the war foj
Cuban freedom, a greater amount was
wasted in the war for Philippine con
quest and subjugation.

The Sutter County Farmer asks some
pertinent questions, which concern
Theodore Bell, the Democratic candi
date for Congress. The Farmer in
quires: "As to the second term matter.
MR. BULL, QUESTIONED.
"Recognizing the great strength and
splendid ability of Duncan E. McKin
lay. Thomas J. Geary is neglecting the
State campaign and is putting in his
best licks against the Santa Rosan who
has been Earned as the Republican
nominee for Congress. For several
weeks he has been doing duty as the
anti-McKinlay editor of the Press-
Democrat, but he is accomplishing very
little, if anything. At heart he is prob
ably for McKinlay, but outwardly he
must pose as a Bell man during the
present political campaign. There is no
tolling how he will vote on election
day."
The campaign on behalf of the Re
publicans is in full swing throughout
the State. The nominees for Congress
are addressing vast audiences of vot
ers, j. X. Gillett's re-election in the
First is beyond doubt.
Duncan E. McKinlay, an ideal cam
paigner and a Republican leader of re
nown, is winning legions of supporters
in the Second District. The Santa Rosa
Republican comments as follows on the
situation in the Seconc:
REPUBLICAN" CAMPAIGN.
The decline of 700 in the registration
of Solano County is a topic that causes
a deal of comment in political camps.
Lieutenant Governor Alden Anderson
of Suisun cays that the falling off is
due to the diminished number of men
employed on the farms and orchards of
the county. In one orchard near Sui
sun, where 100 men were at work In
September, 1902, less than a dozen were
employed In September of this year.
The shortage of the registration In
Shasta County is likewise accounted
for. Political conditions have nothing
to do with the fluctuation.
In the city of Vallejo there Is an In
crease in the number of registered
voters. The falling off is restricted to
the agricultural sections of the county.
The Republicans are not elated over
the decline in Solano, and the Demo
crats are not pleased over the slump in
Shasta. The returns from the entire
State foreshadow substantial gains for
the Republican party. ,â Â»
In the Seventh District James Mc-
Lachlan is a sure winner. The district
is overwhelmingly Republican and the
Democrats do not entertain the slight
est hope of Morton's election.
S. C. Smith, the Republican standara
bearer in the Eighth District, is making
a vigorous and effective campafgn. His
election by a majority of 3000 would not
cause surprise.
The people of the Sixth District en
tPrtain a high regard for the personal
character and public services of J. C.
Xeedham. There is r.o doubt of his re
election to Congress for a fourth term.
The notioi: that Judge Conley of Ma
dera is a wizard in vote-catching is a
fallacy. Former election returns show
that Conley has failed to develop the
average Democratic speed. When the
election returns of 1S0S came in he was
classed with the "also ran." He r"an
liW* votes behind James G. Maguire,
the head of the Democratic ticket, and
Maguire failed of election by 19,193
votes.
SIXTH DISTRICT.
E. A. Hayes, the Republican nominee
in the Fifth, is conducting a highly
creditable campaign. All indications
point to his triumph at the polls.
In the Third District Joseph R.
Know'land will receive a tremendous
majority.
Julius Kahn's prospects for success
in the Fourth District grow brighter
every day. It is tha judgment of well
informed politicians that he will be
elected.
we wonder if Mr. Bell will take his
own medicine when, it comes to voting
for the head of the ticket? "Will he
vote for President Roosevelt on the
same grounds that he asks the Re
publicans to vote for Mr. Bell? Will
he advise his Democratic friends to
return Roosevelt to the Presidential
chair to continue and bring to a suc
ful Issue the good work he is now
doing for the people of this nation?
Will he consider the wide experience
and training in State and national af
fairs which Roosevelt has had and
compare it with the inexperience of
Judge Parker, the Democratic nomi
nee, and will he then apply the same
rule to his vote and influence as he
asks others to do for him? Well hard
ly.
"Mr. Bell is a Democrat first, lastand
all the time, and will support the
Democratic nominees as a matter of
principle and will urge his friends to
do the same, it being perfectly right
and just that he should, looking at the
matter from his standpoint. But if it
is good Democratic doctrine to support
Democratic candidates, it is certainly
good Republican doctrine to support
Republican candidates, especially when
the Republicans of the Second District
have in Duncan E. McKlnlay, their
party nominee, a man who is conceded
to be as well qualified to fill the office
which Mr. Bell occupies as Mr. Bell
himself and can accomplish as much
if elected as Mr. Bell can."
Eminent Orators of the Country

BAN BERNARDINO. Oct. 1.â Two
explosions under the Santa Fe Com
pany's Lytle Creek bridge have set the
police authorities of this section to
work like mad. They have been spurred
to still further effort by the offer of a
$2000 reward by the railroad company,
which Is convinced that dynamiters
have been endeavoring to destroy its
property. The explosions were heard
all over the city last night, and the
flashes were seen by a rancher who
lives in the vicinity and who hastened
to report to the company tbat its
bridge had been wrecked.
Investigation of the matter showed
that two charges of dynamite had been
placed against one of the pillars of the
bridge. Luckily they were too small to
do any serious damage, and the only
result of the explosions was the loosen
ing of the earth a trifle at the base of
the pillars and the knocking off and
blackening of the masonry to an incon
siderable extent.
The motive of the deed was not rob
bery nor train wrecking, as it was well
known that at the time of the explo
sion the next train to pass over the
bridge was not due for two hours. The
consensus of public opinion exonerates
the strikers, who have been conducting
an extraordinarily orderly fight, and
blames some of the discharged stockade
guards and detectives recently released
by the company.

WHO C.ZNZOT BE CURED.
So uniformly successful lias Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription proven in al\ forma
of Female Weakness, Prolapsus, or Falling
of Womb, and Leacorrhea, that, after over
a third of a century's experience in cutine
the ivorst cases of these distressing ana
debilitating ailments. Dr. Pierce now feels
fully warranted in offering: to pay $500 in
cash for any case of these diseases which
he cannot cure.
It Stands Alone.â The "Favorite Pre-
scription" stands alone, as the one and
only remedy for these distressingly com-
mon forms of weakness, possessea of such
positively specific curative properties as to
warrant its makers in proposing:, and
binding: themselves to forfeit, as we, the
undersigned proprietors of that wonderful
remedy hereby do, to pay the sum of $500
in lepal money of the United States in any
case of the above diseases in which after a
fair and reasonable trial of our treatment,
we fail to cure. No other medicine for
the cure of woman's peculiar ailments is
backed by such a remarkable guarantee ;
no other medicine for woman's ills is pos-
sessed of the cnparalleled curative prop-
erties that would warrant its manufacturers
in making: each an offer ; no other remedy
has such a record of cures on which to base
sacli a remarkable offer.
Therefore, insist^ on having 1 Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription and turn vour back
on any unscrupulous dealer who would
insult your intelligence by attempting to
1 foist upon yoa some inferior substitute,
under the plea that "it is just as good."
Insist on having the article which has a
record of a third of a century of cure* and
which is backed by those willing- to forfeit
$500 if they cannot cure you.
In cases attended by a leucorrhcBl drain
a solution of Dr. Pierce's Lotion Tabjets
should be used conjointly with the use of
the "Favorite Prescription." They are sold
by all druggists, or sent post-paid to any

What Sulphur Docs
For the Human Body in Health and
Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days when our'
mothers and grandmothers gave us
our dally dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and falL
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all.
and mind you, this old-fashioned rem-
edy was not without merit.
The idea was good but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to bÂ« taken to get any
effect
XowxuJays we get all the beneficial
effects of eulphur In a palatable, con-
centrated form, so* that a single grain
Is far more effective than a tablespoon-
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Caldnm (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
In drug 6tores under the name of
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. They are
Â¦mall chocolate coated pellets and con-
tain the active medicinal principle ef
rulphur In a highly concentrated, ef-
fective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health;
sulphur acts directly on the liver and
excretory organs, and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elimin-
ation of waste material.
Oar grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and molas-
ses every spring and fall, but the cru-
t lty and impurity of ordinary flowers of
sulphur were often worse than the dis-
ease, and cannot compare with the
modern concentrated preparations of
sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers are undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure con-
stipation and purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi-
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Wllklns while experiment-
Ing with Bulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles, ;
especially when resulting from consti-
pation or malaria, I have been sur-
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re-
peatedly seen them dry up and disap-
pear in four or five days, leaving \he <
skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie- j
tary article and sold by druggists, and
for that reason tabooed by many phy-
sicians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially In all
forms of skin disease as this remedy." j
At any rate people who are tired of :
pills, cathartics and so-called blood ',
"purinerp." will ilnd in Stuart's Cal- j
cium Wafers a far safer, more pala- j
table and effective preparation.

Kelly's Dog Was Kicked.
"He who kicks my dog kicks me,"
were the words of E. F. Kelly, who
lives at 1015 Gough street.
Kelly resented the abuse to his ca
nine and a fisrht followed. Kelly got
the worst of it and while lying pros
trate on the sidewalk received a kick
on the jaw that sent him to the Emer
gency hospital for repairs.
Under the rules of the department

Conlon "shouted for the peddler to get
out of the way. but Lisanti lost his
h*;ad and got in front of the engine

wagon and the engine. . One of the
backing bars of the engine struck him
on the breast. He was taken to the

Dr. J. I. Stephens, chief surgeon of
the Health Department, yesterday
filed an answer and cross-complaint to [
the suit of T. J. Ryan to collect
$592 50 on a note. The . doctor de
mands $2000 damages, $250 attorney's
fees and the return of the note. Dr.
Stephens sought the position of medi
cal examiner for California for' the
State Life Insurance Company of In
diana, represented here by C. A. Mau.
The position was promised, he alleges,
by Mau, who said that the doctor
would have to take' out a policy in the
company.
Dr. Stephens applied for the policy
and gave his note for the premium.
He then learned, he says, that Mau
could not give him the appointment,
which would have to come from the
head . office. Thereupon the surgeon
promptly repudiated his application
for the policy and declined to pay the
note.

I i Under orders from the Chief of Police
yesterday Captain' John B. Martin,
| head of the detective bureau, and Cap
tain Joseph J. Burnett, in command of
! the harbor district, traded jobs.
; It was a surprise to the department,
although Martin's deposition has long
been expected by persons "on the.in
side." Early in the day the Police, Bul
letiti made its appearance and therein
the .Tnembers of the force read a num-
Iber of transfers and assignments, among
;;them 'the transfer of Captain John B.
'Martin from the command of the detec
tive bureau to the command of Com
pa'ny C, harbor district, and the trans
fer of Captain J. J. Burnett from the
command of Company C to the.com
mand of the detective bureau. The or
der was announced to take effect at 4:30
p. in. yesterday. x -
Captain Martin says he was unaware
of the change till he read it in the Po
lice Bulletin; and Captain Burnett was
equally uninformed of his promotion.
Chief Wittman refuses to say anything
regarding the "switch" except the
usual formulaâ "for the good of the de
partment."
i It has been common report for some
time that the Chief was dissatisfied
; with the Work of . the detective branch
of the "department' and contemplated a
change. It is possible that the new
.head of that branch may find it neces
sary to Infuse new blood into it, deem
ing it desirable to have on his staff a
few men with an analytical power of
1 reasoning in the ferreting out of crime.
[ Captain Martin was appointed head
I of the detective, bureau on June 1, 1902,
: on the retirement of Captain Seymour.
. He has since handled several important
'cases successfully and has made hosts
; df'frlends. : He has said several times
I that the position'was not of his seeking
and that he preferred the less strenu
â¢ ous life of the captain of a district. It
â¢ is hinted that some of the men took
| advantage of his good nature and were
i not so careful and active in the*per
\ formance of their work as they should
|" have been. ,
I His successor, Captain Burnett, also
j has many friends. 'He has the confl
Â¦ dence of the Chief and It is predicted
j that he will soon prove by his work
i that the confidence placed in him by
j Wittman has not been misplaced* He
I received.; his double .bars on May 1,

of ceremonies. The programme was
arranged by a special committee of
v.hich R. L. R.adke was the chairman.
After the supper the chairman, on
behalf of those assembled, presented
to Captain Hurlbut a handsome and
comfortable leather-covered arm
chair and a leather-covered couch
upon "shich to repose after the fa
tigues of drilling the corps. When the
captain had responded he was ad
dressed by Samuel M. Shortridge, who,
after saying many pleasant things
about the corps and the degree of
efficiency to which it had been brought,
presented him with a costly crystal
punchbowl, set of crystal glasses and
stand and an elegant wine cooler. Then
followed music and songs, short con
gratulatory talks, and literary num
bers. The principal speakers were
Professor J. W. Anderson, G. H. Pippy

IIOXO11S CAPTAIX HURL-BUT
Ticket Broker T. A. Rigdon yester
day mbrnins presented his defense to
the charge of contempt of court for
violation of the injunction against
scalping Kr.ishts Templar and Odd
Fellow excursion tickets. He filed an
answer and demurrer to the order to
f=how cause and these were admitted
by Judge Murasky after strenuous ob
jections by Foshay Walker, attorney
lor the Southern Pacific. After read
ing the answer, Samuel Shortridge, at
torney for Rigdon, offered two affida
vits from Chicago tending to excul
pate Rigdon from any guilt in connec
tion with the sale of a ticket to James
Smith. Upon Walker's objection the af
fidavits were not admitted.
Shorn idge promised to produce au
thorities for the acceptance of affida
vits in such a case and the hearing was
continued tili next Wednesday morn
ing, when, if the affidavits are again
ruled out, an application will be made
for a commission to take the deposi
tions of the Chicago witnesses.
Rigdon's answer is long and covers
many points in opposition to the con
tempt proceedings. It contends that
the injunction was not properly made
and that the court was without juris
diction in the matter; that it deprives
him of the right to property and the
right to enter into contracts; that it
does not appear that the plaintiffs have
a legal capacity to sue; that they have
not complied with the act of the Legis
lature relating to the appointment by
foreign corporations of an agent
against whom a process may be served
and that they have not complied with
the act of JSK'l by filing certified copies
of their articles of incorporation.
It is also alleged that the complaint
does not show that the plaintiffs have
been injured by acts? uf the defendant,
and that the Southern Pacific and its
connecting lines have unlawfully con
spired to restrain trade, by fixing non
competitive rates for the transportation
of passengers.
Higrdon further declares that the
agent of the Chicago and Northwestern
road at Chicago knew that the person
who signed the ticket was not James
Smith, and knew that the person sign
ing the ticket had the authority to do
so and that the return portion of the
â¢Â«.ieket was to be used by James Smith.

KIEL, Oct. 1.â Although directors of
the Germanla Shipbuilding Works said
yesterday that Herr Barkmeyer, chief
of the confidential bureau of the Ger
mania works, had not been arrested for
selling military secrets to a foreign
power, it appears to be nevertheless
true that he is under suspicion of sell
ing the plans of ships to another Ger
man firm, and it is known the German
Navy Department's perfected plans for
the construction of submarine boats
have in some manner come Into the
possession of the Russian Government,
whether through Barkmeyer or not Is
not clear. The Navy Department has
been experimenting for two years with
submarine boats, and committed a de
sign some months ago for a new sub
marine boat to the Germania works to
execute. It is a copy of this plan that
is reported to have reached Russia.

LONDON, Oct. 1.â The success at
tained by the Arachne Club in training
young women of gentle birth for do
mestic service and obtaining situations
for them where they are guaranteed
good pay and good treatment has led to
a still more ambitious effort to solve
the eternal servant girl problem. Two
unions have been formed, one known
as the National Union of Domestic
Servants and the other styled the Na
tional Union of Mistresses. These are
quite independent of each other, with
separate committees of management,
but^these committees will meet in con
ference and form a sort of conciliation
board, where differences can be settled.
The dual scheme is the idea of Miss
Agatha Henslow, the secretary of the
Arachne Club. Its purpose is to bring
together on the one hand a body of
competent servants capable of doing
good worlc and pledged to do It, and on
the other an organization of employ
ers willing to pay fair wages for such
service, while according servants op
portunities for a reasonable amount of
leisure and enjoyment. An atttempt
will be made to draw up a set of rules
which shall define the relative duties
and obligations of both maids and mis
tresses.
"As yet," says Miss Henslow, "the
rules are under discussion, but one
point we shall emphasize very strongly
â that mistresses shall have some do
mestic training themselves. If they
know by experience what household
work is they will not exact unreason
able tasks of servants. Fully half the
difficulties of domestic servants are
caused by the ignorance of mistresses.
I am convinced that domestic service
will remain In its present unpopular
position until the servants themselves
combine to raise it. But if all good
servants banded together and excluded
the bad ones they could raise it.
"In the case of the ladies trained at
the Arachne Club they get places with
better conditions, better pay and more
freedom than any other servants. If
the club can by proper training and the
adoption of business methods do so
much for ladies whom mistresses are
naturally shy of employing, a union of
bona fide servants should certainly be
able to accomplish as much for them
selves."

A short time ago we published an ar-
ticle recommending to our readers the
new discovery for the cure of Dyspep-
sia, called Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
and the claims then made regarding
the wonderful curative properties of
the remedy have been abundantly sus-
tained by? the facts. People who were
cautious tabout trying new remedies
advertised in the newspapers and were
finally induced to give Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets a trial were surprised
and delighted at the results. In many
cages a single package costing but oO
cents at any drug store made a com-
plete cure and in every instance the
most beneficial results were reported.
From a hundred or more received we
have space to publish only a few of
the latest, but assure bur readers we
receive so many commendatory letters
that we shall publish each week a fresh
list of genuine, unsolicited testimo-
nials and never publish the same one
twice! â¢
From James' Yemmeisler, La Crosse,
Wis.: Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
doing me more good than anything I
ever tried and I was so pleased at re-
sults that I gave away several boxes to
my friends, who have also had the
eame benefits.
From Jacob . Anthony, Portmurray,
New Jersey: I hav^) taken Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets with the best re-
sults. I had Dyspepsia for 6 years
and had taken a great deal of medicine,
but the Tablets seem to take right a
hold and I feel good. I am a farmer
and lime burner and I heartily recom-
mend to everyone who has any trouble
with his stomach to use these Tablets.
From Mrs. M. K. West, Preston,
Minn.; I have received surprisingly
good effects from using Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets. I gave ona-haJf of my
last box to a friend who also suffered
from Indigestion and she had the same
good results.
From Mrs. Agnes K. Ralston, Cadil-
lac, Mich.: I have been taking Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets and I am very much
better, and feel very grateful for the
great benefit I have received in so short
a time.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a cer-
tain cure for all forms of Indigestion.
They are not claimed to be a cure-all,
but are prepared for stomach troubles
only, and physicians and druggists
everywhere recommend them to all per-
sons suffering from Nervous Dyspep-
sia, sour or acid stomach, heartburn,
bloating or wind on stomach and simi-
lar disorders. ,.; . 'Â¦'Â¦ .

Fincs Man Who Kills Quail.
WILLOWS, Oct. 1. â While return-
ing from a mountain trip several
young men from Sacramento, one of
whom is named Behrn, killed some
quail, which they were planning to
I express to their friends in the capital
city. At Elk Creek, they met Justice
West, who took thie young men in
charge and explained the county game
law and fined Behrn $25 for infringing
upon it.
Occasionally wounded men are
brought in here, but the fighting is in

MUKDEN,. Oct. 1. (Delayed in
transmission.) â The Japanese posi
tion is relatively the same now as
when, August 26, the Japanese were
twenty miles south and east of Liao
yang. If they are reinforced suf
ficiently they might in one or two
quick movements engage the Russians
close to the Mukden defenses and re
attempt here what they failed to do
at Liaoyang.
Japanese May Re- Attempt What They
Failed to Do at Uaoyang.
ALL QUIET AT MUKDEN*.
General Linevitch.
Quarters are being prepared at the
Winter Palace for Viceroy Alexieff,
upon whom the Emperor intends to
bestow a mark of signal honor to
prove that his return in nowise is in
the nature of a disgrace. Alexieff
will be received with pomp befitting
the rank of Viceroy, which he will
continue to hold in his term of res
idence here. The report of his ap
pointment as Minister of Foreign Af
fairs is true in substance if not in
form, as he will undoubtedly be con
sulted on matters of foreign policy
affecting the Far East. It is quite
possible that when the war is over
Alexieff will return to the Far East
in his former capacity.
while traffic on the Mukden-Sintmin
tin highway is about normal. Both
sides are observing the strictest neu
trality in the case of the Sintmintin
Railway. Tl.ere are no Japanese im
portations Â«nd traffic is uninterrupt
ed. One hundred and twenty-four
horsecart loads of silver were' sent to
Sintmintin by the Chinese here yes
terday, but the natives are recovering
confidence. Shops are being reopened
and the number of refugees is dimin
ishing on the Sintmintin road.
The condition of the Russian army
entirely contradicts the late sensa
tional reports.
CZAR MAKES CHANGES.
General Rydzevsky to Take Charge
of Telegraph Department.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 1. â Gen
eral Rydzevsky, who recently resigned
the important position of chief sec
retary to the Minister of the imperial
household in order to be able to ac
cept the position of chief of the gend
armerie, has been appointed Under
Secretary of the Interior, but he is
more likely to replace M. Durovo,
head of the Department of Telegraphs
in the Ministry of the Interior, than
to take charge of the gendarmerie.
General Zouieff, who was chief of
staff of the gendarmerie under the
late Minister of the Interior Sipia
guine, is considered to be the most
probable candidate for commander of
the gendarmerie.
According to their version, the first
army will be placed under command
of General Lubovitfki, now command
ing the Ninth Army Corps at Kieff,
and a third army undpr Lieutenant
The numeroui friends and supporters
of General Kurnpatkin declare that
even this Justifies their prediction
that he, after all, will be appointed
chief in command of the armies in the
Far Kast and that the Emperor has le
contidored his determination of send
ing out Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholae
vitch as commander in chief.
The forthcoming changes in the na
val commands have been the subject of
widespread discussion. The necessity
for the changes is generally admitted.
but whether Emperor Nicholas will
give immediate effect to the reorgani
zation is uncertain. Meanwhile Vice
Admiral Avellan requests that a for
mal denial of the news of his retire
ment from the Ministry of Marine be
made public.
BT. PETERSBURG. Oct. 2. 1:35 a. m.
A dispatch from General Sakharoff
received by the general staff late to
night brings the record of events up to
September 30. It shows that the Jap
ar.ese advance on the eastern side, in
the region of Bentziaputze. has been
checked. This movement still appears
to be an outpost aJTair, not accompa
nied with serious fighting, no advance
of the Japanese in force having oc
curred up to the date mentioned. The
operations to the west of Mukden have
extended twenty-six miles down the
Kun River, where the Japanese were
temporarily driven out from Tschantan
and seven supply boats were burned. It
is possible that this raid is identical
with that reported from Mukden, al
though in the latter it is stated to have
occurred on he Liao Kiver. In any
case it shows that the Japanese are
using the river to bring up supplies
and that their operations aie being op
posed. They have not succeeded in ap
proaching nearer Tschantan along the
line of the Hun River.
AIITKDEN. Oct. 1.â A detachment of
sixiy members of the Kubansky cav
airy. Trith tivo officers, has return
ed here alter a successful raid on a
flotilla, of Japanese supply boats on the
Liao River. They brought back two
Jariaxifts* prisoners. The raiders suc
ceeded in boarding and setting flre'to
nine junks and barges. severaJ of
v.hich were laden with ammunition,
and these were blown up with terrific
explosions. The cavalrymen reached
chore in safety. They met a Japanese
patrol, two members of which they
killed and took the prisoners whom
they brought here.
The inactivity here continues and is
becoming: monotonous. It is generally
believed, however, that operations will
be besrun with renewed energy next
week.
Â©ilierwise honored, ills return to the
Far Hast as YitM-roy at the conclusion
of the war is by many persons consid
ered to be quile possible.
Advices received by the Russian
genrral stall last night are to thc ef
fect that a check has been pat upon
the advance of the Japanese to the
eastrrard of Mukden and show that
tlie movement Is considered to be of
little Importance. Tito reports of raids
upon vessels carrying supplies for the
Japanese hare reached St. Petersburg.
It is considered probable, however,
tiiat They refer to tlie same affair,
tbousfr tlie namber of ressels de
stroyed and tlie locality of the action
are differently stated in the two dis
patches. General KuropaUdn's friends
still assert that he is to be in chief
command of the Russian forces in
Manchuria. Viceroy Alcxiefl will be
received tvilh sreat pomp upon his
return to St. Petersburg, where he will
be quartered in the Winter Palace and

CONTRACTS FOR PORTLAND
FAIR BUIL.DINGS AWARDED
PASADENA, Oct. 1.â Arthur Smith
of South Pasadena left the Pasadena
Hospital to-day substantially cured.'
His case is the cause of much aston
ishment among -the members of the
local medical fraternity.
Last Saturday Smith was carried to
the hospital suffering exquisite pain
and apparently at death's door. He
had fallen thirty feet down a newly
dug well and an iron rod one-half inch
in diameter penetrated the inside of
the right thigh and came out of the
right shoulder. His death was pre
dicted, but greatly to the surprise of
the physicians he gradually improved,
and when discharged was almost as
strong as ever.
Discharged From Hospital as Cured,
Much to the Surprise of Mcdi-

Gladstone he was the greatest debater
of his day. As a parliamentarian he
stood only next after Peel, Disraeli and
Gladstone. As a speaker it was not
Gladstone whom he followed as a
model, but Disraeli, and with him he
was more often compared.
On leaving Cambridge Harcourt,
while studying law, drifted into news
paper work, which he kept up until his
entrance into Parliament. He was
among the earliest recruits of the Sat
urday Review, and as "Hlstoricus"
wrote many notable articles for the
London Times.
According to one writer Harcourt
was one of the most cordially hated
Englishmen in America. That feeling
existed ever since 1860. when over the
pen name of "Historicus" he contribu
ted to the London Times a series of
letters on points of international law
raised by the American Civil War.
These articles were continued from
session of Parliament, subsequent to
the announcement that he no longer
was able to perform his duties, Har
court attacked Joseph Chamberlain's
finance proposals in a lengthy speech,
delivered in that Homeric, slashing
style so familiar for many a year to
all those connected with British poli
tics.
WIELDED GREAT POWER.
The general opinion expressed in
the biographies appearing to-day is
that Sir William Vernon Harcourt
never quite got over the action of
Gladstone in selecting Lord Rosebery
instead of himself as his successor
and since Harcourt gave up the Lib
eral leadership in the House of Com;
mons, after a dispute with the younger
Premier, he had not taken open part
in the councils of the party, though
he remained a powerful Jnrrer Influ
ence, being as much feared as liked
personally.
The hospitality, displayed by Sir
William Vernon Harcourt and his wife
to the latter's fellow-countrymen and
the interest they took in all Ameri
can questions have been proverbial in
England for many years.
STATESMAN OP NOTE.
Hnrcourt's Brilliant Record in Eng
lish Political Life
Sir William Harcourt was born on
October 14, 1S27. He was a scion of the
noble house of Vernon and it was as a
Vernon that he came into the world. In
his early childhood' the earldom of Har
court became .extinct and his grand
father, . the . Most Rev. and Honorable
Edward Vernon, assumed the ancient
name. He studied' at Trinity College
and graduated with high honor in 1851.
He was called to the bar at the Inner
Temple, In 1854 arid was appointed
Queen's counsel In 1866. '
In 1869, he was made professor of in
ternational . law In. the University of
Cambridge. In November, 3873, he was
appointed Solicitor General, on which
occasion he was knighted, and held
the office untir the resignation of Glad
stone's Cabinet the following February.
He made an .unsuccessful stand for a
seat in Parliament - from Kirk-Caldy
burgs in 180S, but was' returned to the
House of Commons for the city of Ox
ford in 1863.
He was 41 years old when he entered
Parliament and. he lost no' lime in let
ting himself be; heard. In his maiden
speech '"he - discussed 'a constitutional
question and drew a flattering compli
ment'from Gladstone. ' Harcourt served
several times inr the Ministry, Glad
stone retaining him as Home Secretary,
1880-85; Chancellor of the, Exchequer in
188C-87 and 1892-95. In 189S he was made
a member of .the rbyal ; commission at>
pomted' to inquire into the Jamison
raid. ::v,-yÂ£
After the retirement of Lord Rose
bery from politics Sir "William Harcourt
was the â¢ recognized j leader of the oppo
sition. Though lacking ! the business
training of 'Gos'chen; -his management
of Â» the finances ' of the British Govern
ment-was brilliant. Brilliant also was
his leadership â¢ of the minority against
an overwhelming; Conservative major
ity. But it was S as an orator that he
ranked highest In English Parliament
ary annals. He was the last represent
ative of the old school of British states
men, which includes such names as
Peel, * Gladstone, John.- Bright, Pelmer
ston 'and Sir. Stafford Northcote. After
time to time until 1867 and Involved a
discussion of such questions as the
Trent affair.
In 1S76 he married as his second wife
Mrs. Ives, daughter of John Lathrop
Motley. Unjted States Minister to Great
Britain.

The large loss of capital during the
week was principally due to transfers
by Interior public depositories of their
excess collections of, internal revenue
to the New York sub-treasury through
their correspondents in this city. The
large excess in these revenue receipts
at this time appears to indicate in
creased manufacturing of taxable arti
cles.
The statement of averages of the
clearing-house banks of this city for
the week shows: Loans $1,143,033,900,
increase $4,529,100; deposits $1,212,797,100,
decrease $1,2SC,000; circulation $40,576.

States deposits $25,729,025, decrease $6,

NEW YORK, Oct. 1.â The Financier
says: The official statement of the New
York Associated Banks this week
showed as the chief features the unex
pected expansion in loans and a reduc
tion Bomewhat less than that estimated
in the traceable movements of money
during the week. The decrease In sur
plus reserve carried this item to within
510,375,000 of the lowest of the year,
which was recorded on JanuarV 2, and
it made the reduction in the surplus
since August 27 $38,699,600. The loss of
cash in this interval was $36,086,700, and
the expansion of loans was $43,976,799.
The cash decreased last week $6,659,
100, or $1,539,100 less than that which
was estimated. The deposits decreased
$1,286,000, whereas the sum of the loss
in cash less the increase in loans called
for a reduction of $2,130,000 in deposits.
The required reserve was diminished
by $321,500. deducting which from the
decrease in cash left $6,337,600 as the
reduction in surplus reserve to $19,913,
425. Computed upon the basis of de
posits, less those of $23,262,400 public
funds, the surplus was $25,729,025. The
loans were expanded by $4,529,100, prob
ably the result of corporation borrow
ing and also the loaning of funds tem
porarily deposited with the banks in
anticipation of October disbursements
for dividends and interest.

Death of a Famous Cartoonist.
LOUISVILLE. Ky., Oct. 1.â George
Kerr, famous a few years ago as a
cartoonist and illustrator, is dead at
the Soldiers' Home in Dayton, O. He
served in the Northern army through
out tbe war and at its conclusion be
came an illustrator for an Eastern
magazine, going later to a New York
comic paper.
BANKS REPORT
LOAN INCREASE
PAY TRIBUTE TO THE DEAD.
The evening edition of the Stand
ard, one of the deceased's opponents, '<
aptly and generously says:
"With the late Liberal leader there
has passed away one of the last of
those Titanic figures bound up with
the â¢ most brilliant traditions of the
House of Commons. There are but a ',
few left of those eminent statesmen \
who received their political training
at the hands of Gladstone and Dis
raeli. The coincidence of his death
with the intended withdrawal of the
distinguished statesman into well
earned repose after a career of hard
work and political activity gives added
pathos to the event."
In a Bimilar vein the Pall Mall Ga
zette, out and out Conservative In its
views, pays a tribute to one of the
"most striking figures of the political
arena," while the Liberal ~ afternoon
papers deplore the loss . sustained by
their party.
Another Conservative afternoon paper
says: "Sir William Verrion Harcourt
served his generation and served it
well. He was bound to political friends
with bonds of friendship which for his
part rarely if ever were broken, and he
leaves a memory which will be honored
in the House of Commons for many
years to come."
REGRET DEATH OF STATESMAN.
Not since Lord Salisbury died, and
scarcely then, for the late Premier had
few personal friends, has the death of
any statesman created so much genu
ine feeling at the headquarters of both
parties. The National Liberal Club im
mediately half-masted Its flag and sent
a message of sympathy to Lady Har
court. â¢ The other clubs Â¦ followed suit
It was stated only a few weeks ago that
King Edward had urged Harcourt once
againâ for Sir William twice refused a
peerage â to accept some mark of dis
tinction upon the close of his active
career. In his last speech, delivered at
the National Liberal Club July 28, Sir
William said somewhat pathetically:
"It i3 not because I am weary of the
fight or am lukewarm in the cause
that I intend to retire. It Is because
I do not think it for the public ad
vantage that people should attempt
to fulfill duties that they are unable
to perform."
Yesterday evening, during the last
Among all classes in the United
Kingdom, regardless of party, the un
expected news caused a sensation and
genuine regret The somewhat pa
thetic announcement In -March, last of
his intended retirement- had prepared
the public for Sir "William's eventual
disappearance from the active arean
of political strife, but there had been
no whisper that his stalwart consti
tution had been radically impaired by
nearly forty years of fierce parlia
mentary strife.
LONDON, Oct 1.â Sir William Ver
non Harcourt, "the finest political gla
diator of his age," : died very suddenly
to-day at Newnham Park, near-Ox
ford, the country seat which he re
cently Inherited from his i nephew.
Only his wife, a daughter of the late
John Lothrop Motley, the historian
and former American Minister ' to
Great Britain.- was with him.
When Sir William went to bed last
night ha seemed fairly well, though he
had been suffering from a slight chill.
This morning when he was called he
replied cheerily, "In a short time."
Later a servant entered the room and
found Sir William lying dead on his
bed. His son, Lewis Vernon Harcourt,
member of Parliament for the Rosa
endale division of Lancashire, was
hastily summoned from London.
Sir William Vernon Harc'ourt be
came the Liberal leader in the House
of Commons on Gladstone's retirement
In 1894 and held that position until
February last, when he announced his

The hair of the head is
far more sensitive to
climatic changes than is '
usually supposed, and this
fact is peculiarly apparent
in California.
When the hair becomes
dry, brittle and falls out
and dandruff forms upon
the scalp it is an absolutely
certain indication of
diseased' conditions, .which,
unless promptly treated,
will result in baldness.

There is a time which comes to all of
us when we look back and reflect upon
the opportunities we have wasted;
the money we have thrown away.
We never realize the value of money un
til we need it badly and cannot get it.
Had we saved money when we had the
chance we would not be in need. After
all. the world has little use for the man
who has no money. We see daily exem
plifications of that statement. The se
cret of success is the ability to save. No
matter whether we are earning wages or
salary, we can always put something
aside each year or each mcfeth. The
Phoenix Sayings, B. and L. Ass'n will
open a savings account for $1. paying
4'/Â£ per cent, interest compounded semi

payable semi-annually. Paid-up capital.
$1,250,000; guarantee capital, $200,000.

LEADING TRANSACTIONS.
The demand for office accommoda
tions is one of the present interesting
signs relating to San Francisco in
come realty. All- the large office build
ings in the city have long waiting lists
of applicants for offices. With â¢ the
Flood building in view and the thou
sands of offices that are now in use,
the supply is not abreast of the de
mand. This has led property owners
to conf ider the construction of offices.
One of the indications of this is the
ehanpe in determination that Hartland
Law has reached. He will not put up
a hotel on the site. of the Bishop. block
on Market stroet. which was his orig
inal idea. Instead he will construct a
nine-story office building, adding sto
ries to the existing structure.

GRAPE-XCTS.
FEEDEXG A DOCTOR.
His Body Changed by Change in Pood.
A convincing bit of testimony to
show what a simple change of food
can sometimes do to end apparently in-
curable disease Is told in the following
article by a Chicago physician:
"The case is my own. I had been suf-
fering for more than 25 years with
nervous dyspepsia, insomnia, occasion-
al kidney trouble, and general disturb-
ance of my whole system. My appetite
was affected so I lost weight and
strength, but most serious of all was
the gradual failure of my memory,
proving that my brain and nerves were
not getting the proper food any more
than the rest of my body.
"Three times I made the journey
to Carlsbad, and spent a fortune con-
sulting famous physicians and special-
ists in this country and Europe, but
Beyer pot any permanent results. All
the medicines known to science failed
to give me even temporary relief in
spite of the fact that I was always ex-
c^tdinely careful in my diet. I was on
the vcr^e of despair and never looked
forward to being well again.
"One day about two years ago I was
staying at a hotel in Minneapolis ac-
companied by a famous European
Physician, Dr. Werner of Berlin, and
there we noticed a new food on the
menu called Grape Nuts. Having little
oe*fre to eat I ordered some Just to see
r Â£V ike 3nd the " |? r!
ach which I had always suffered evTn
after the lightest meal. On my return
to Chicago my very first a?t ?aVS ""
der Grape Xuts Bent to my home
where the whole family relish it ; Â£
much they use it daily without any
urging and we expect to do so as lonsr
as we live. . s
"As the result only of this change of
food to Grape-Nuts the awful disease
which I suffered with for more than 20
years disappeared entirely in about
three weeks. I have regained my
heaJth. strength and vigor and about
22 pounds in weight. All of this is due
oniy to the thoroughly nourishing and
completely digestible character of this
foodâ Grape-Xuts." Name given by

"Now, vou know why 'Little Phil'
Is so strong in the hearts of the peo
ple, so beloved and esteemed."
J. J. Burke, candidate for the As
sembly, made his debut as a political
speaker and favorably impressed, the
audience. Altogther, party leaders
were disposed to congraulate them
selves and the party upon the spirit
shown at the meeting, the large at
tendance and the promise of success at
the coming election.
Phil Walsh, candidate for the Assem
bly, won his hearers by a short address
full of wit, replete with arguments
tending to prove the worth df his fel
low candidates and reasons why they
all should be elected to office. When
he had concluded, Chairman Britton
said:
"I saw both conventions," said the
speaker. "The Chicago convention was
exceedingly instructive, the one at St.
Louis immensely entertaining. Demo
crats may say that the Republican
proceedings resembled machinery. No
one will ever assert that so bewildering
a lot of antics as those perpetrated by
the Democrats could have been the re
sult of machinery. One thing that
Democrats of all shades, whether con
servative, radical, 16 to 1, or for gold
standard (by wire), always talk about
is their adoration of Thomas Jefferson.
I think Jefferson deserves better of his
country than to have become the poli
tical merry-go-round for the ever
changing whims of the Democratic
party."
FOR FELLOW CANDIDATES.
and they were given with hearty
unanimity.
Frank H. Short, when instroduced,
begged his hearers not to look upon
him as a composite General Barnes
and Samuel Shortridge, declaring that
he was a simple country lawyer who
occasionally talked to Democrats,
with whom he sympathized. He chal
lenged the Democratic assertion that
the nomination of President Roosevelt
was the result of a prearranged pro
gramme, declaring that the delegates
at Chicago represented the will of the
people when they nominated the Pres
ident.
"The coming of cheap labor of the
sort which cannot be assimilated by
the nation I shall always oppose. If
cur opponents wish to make President
Roosevelt the issue, we accept that is
sue. We are proud of him. Proud of
the support this district has given to
his administration, proud of the recog
nition he has given our townsmen, Mr.
Metcalf, and I bespeak for him, the
greatest Republican vote ever record
ed in this Congressional District."
When Senator Knowland had con
cluded Chairman Reed called for three
cheers for "Congressman Knowland,"
"It is not the least gratifying: fea
ture of the political situation," said
Mr. Knowland, "that my relations
with Secretary Metcalf, formerly your
Congressman, are such that he has
voluntarily promised that in the event
of my election I shall have the benefit
of his experience, advice and assist
ance. It is my purpose, if elected, to
maintain in Oakland permanent head
quarters. I pledge my active and loy
al support to measures calculated to
improve Oakland harbor, to enlarge
the Government's naval operations at
Vallejo and to promote those matters
known to be for Oakland's best in
terests.
Senator Knowland was introduced
to the audience as "your next Con
gressman." The band played a bit of
patriotic music as the distinguished
young lawyer from Alameda came to
the front and the audience greeted
him "with vociferous applause.

1016 Broadway, Oct. 1.
In the presence of an audience of
stalwart Republicans that packed the
Dewey Theater to the doors and ceiling
to-night notable men of the party In
California paid tribute to President
Roosevelt, to Senator Fairbanks, to the
candidates of State and county, and
to the principles which those eminent
men represent.
The rally indicated the unanimity
and enthusiasm of the Republican
hosts In Alameda County. It was the
first meeting of the campaign and it
convinced all observers from leader to
privates in the ranks that this, the
banner stronghold of Republicanism in
the State, may be counted upon to
roll up in November an even greater
majority than was given the national
ticket at the election in 1900.
Frank H. Short of Fresno delivered
the principal address and charmed and
convinced his hearers. He â¢was pre
ceded by some of the most prominent
men of the party in Alameda County,
among them being J. R. Knowland,
candidate for Congress, State Senator
G. R. Lukens, Assemblyman Phil M.
Walsh. J. A. Bliss. R. K. E. Espey,
J. J. Burke and Supervisors John
Mitchell and H. D. Rowe. Each made
6hort telling addresses and all were
cordially and enthusiastically received.
Clarence Crowd!, chairman of the
County Central Committee, was to
have acted as chairman, but as he
had unexpectedly taken to himself a

GRIDLEY, Oct. 1.â The celebration
and barbecue given to-day in honor of
the opening of the Butte County Canal,
an irrigation system which contem
plates the watering of 215,000 acres of
land in this and Sutter County, was
a great success. Two thousand people
attended, many being from San Fran
cisco, Sacramento and other outside
points.
A dedicatory address, written by
General W. S. Green of Colusa, was
read at the canal banks by W. A.
Beard, secretary of the Sacramento
Valley Development Association, Gen
eral Green being unable to attend on
account of ill health. The barbecue
occurred at noon and was followed by
a programme which included an able
address by Charles Wesley Reed of
San^ Francisco, a rousing talk by W.
A. Beard, another by Senator Mar
shall Diggs of Yuba County and a
short talk by Wlllard M. Sheldon, sec
retary of the Butte County Canal Com
pany of San Francisco.
The day's festivities closed with a
dance in the opera house.
Following is an extract from Green's
paper:
"We have gathered' here to-day to
dedicate a channel of opportunities
through which must flow wealth un
told and unmeasured by any present
standard to the present inhabitants of
the Sacramento Valley, but which must
go on and on, increasing opportunities
for the generations yet unborn. Make
progress as fast as you, who now own
the land, think it possible for human
energies to move, and yet the next
generation will wonder why you were
so slow to see and in grasping oppor
tunities.
"All the prosperity. of Southern Cali
fornia is built upon water. Then, gen
tlemen, go down there and look closely
at the water supply and then come
back and look at the supply of the
Feather River. Look at the vast area
of magnificent land lying under the
canal, the dedication of which brings
us here, and you will see that the
Feather River will furnish more water
for irrigation than all the streams
south of Tehachapi put together.
"The territory covered by the canal
we dedicate to-day can produce double
as much of any given thing, from pea
nuts to oranges, as all. south of Te
hachapi. Think you that when we have
progressed up to half the cultivation
of our southern neighbors we will have
to beg for special trains to travel. We
will have no such thing as a little ac
commodation train run a few months
4n the year, and have it taken off just
as we begin to feel that we need it.
"Other overland railroads are head
ing for that territory for its trade. If
another overland road is heading to
ward us it is because we have land to
hold the two parts of their roads to
gether. We^ have seen no place where
we are taken into the account, and yet
every man here knows that the lands
that can be watered from this source,
will produce more than all that terri
tory. This, gentlemen. Is the begin
ning of the end. Many of you who are
now here will see half that number on
the land and you will then begin to see
that the land is not half worked. You
have a grand problem before you and
I hope that you will realize and work
up to it."
Special Dispatch to. The Call.
ALAMEDA. Oct. 1.â The tax levy of
$1 38 on each $100 dollars of assessed
valuation that is to be levied Monday
night by the City Trustees on a total
valuation of $12,257,287 is to be divided
among the several municipal funds as
follows: General, 68 cents; bond re-Â«
demptlon and interest, 27 cents; street,
20 cents; general school. 14 cents; high
school, 12 cents; library 7 cents. This
levy is 13 cents higher than that of last
year and Is the highest In the history of
the city.
Last year, with practically the urns
total assessed valuation the rate was
$1 25 on each $100 dollars and waa di
vided as follows among the various
funds: General, 53.5 cents; street. 20.5
cents; bond redemption and Interest,
18.4 cents; general school, 10 cents;
High School, 14 cents; library, 7 cents.
The estimates of the departments
were last night pared down from a total
of $197,214 99 to $172,876 50, the amount
to be raised by the new levy. All esti
mates for increase in salaries were
eliminated.
Out of the coming levy $33,723 67 Is to
be paid for Interest and redemption of
bonds. Provision was also made for an
appropriation of $15,000 for new ma
chinery for the municipal electric plant.
The Board of Education asked for $26.
155 for the grammar schools and waa
allowed $17,538 20. The High School was
allowed $15,032 74, instead of the $17,024
requested.
HIS HONOR WILL. MAKE VISIT
TO INCINERATING PLANT
Jndge Ellsworth Decides to Examine
for Himself the Condition of
Alleged Nuisance.
OAKLAND, Oct. 1. â Judge Ells
worth decided to-day that in order to
properly consider the damage case of
Leonard! Vinci against the city of
Oakland he must first visit the gar
bage crematory complained of and ex
amine its condition.
Vinci sues the city for $20,000
damages, alleging that the Pacific In
cinerating Company's crematory near
his home injures his family's health
and decreases the value of his prop
erty. He seeks to hold the city re
sponsible. Trial of the case began
this morning, but was continued to
Monday to permit of the Judge's visit
to the crematory.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Oct. 1.
Professor Ralph H. Curtiss, astrono
mer at the Lick Observatory, is the au
thor of a bulletin Issued at the Univer
sity of California to-day containing the
description of a proposed new method
for determining the velocities of the
heavenly bodies toward or away from
the earth- by means of the spectro
graph. In the results obtained through
the employment of the methods hereto
fore known discrepancies have arisen,
largely from recognized sources of er
rors in the methods used. In the at
tempt to eliminate mistakes the new
method has been devised.
With the new "method the determina
tion of velocities is confined to the
spectrograph Itself. The essential ad
vantage of the method rests in the fact
that velocity determinations are se
cured by comparing the light of the
stars with that of the sun as such light
is analyzed by the spectrograph. Prac
tical Independence of physical measures
is thus secured. The method is short
and direct and requires only the same
instruments that are employed in other
methods. _ '
In order to Illustrate the performance
of this method Professor Curtiss has
applied it to the particularly difficult
case of a faint, variable star. This star
more than doubles its brightness in
three days, then returns In the next
four and one-half days to its original
brilliancy, after which It gradually
rises again, thus returning to its great
est brightness every seven and a half
days.
Professor Curtiss has made thirty
three determinations of the velocity of
this star, which have shown that in
reality there are two bodies revolving
about one another in a closed system,
a period of revolution corresponding to
that of the light variations. A diagram
showing the form of the orbit accom
panies the bulletin.
Further, the astronomer considers it
probable that the brighter body is five
times heavier than the other, that their
size is about the same as that of the
sun and that their distance apart is
about 6,000,000 miles. In such a system
the tidal force acting on the larger
body would be about 50,000 times as in
tense as the tidal force on the earth
due to the. moon and would vary as
the bodies move around in their orbits.
These varying tidal forces acting on
the masses of molten matter on the
star's surface probably give rise to the
variation in the star's light.
Results of measures on three other
pointer stars are also given. Two of
these are discovered to be double. Thus
already by the use of the new method
the three faintest binaries yet discov
ered with the spectrograph have been
detected and studied and the orbit of
one of them has been derived.
Ready to Fight Fires.
BERKELEY, Oct. 1. â The Fire De
partment is now better equipped to
fight fires than ever before. The
scheme of paying the men for fight
ing fires went into effect to-day. The
change was made in accordance with
the action of the Board of Trustees
Ia3t Monday night, when a number of
men nere chosen for the various fire
houses at salaries of $70 a month.
There Is only one company that still
retains its volunteer standing: â the
North Berkeley company. In time the
Town Trustees will equip each flre
house with improved apparatus.
Pioneer Mason Dies.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 1. â James Atkin
son, a pioneer of the early '50's and a
prominent member of the Masonic
fraternity, died yesterday at the home
of his daughter, Mrs. Jane Everts,
2603 Santa Clara avenue. He was
born in Ireland sixty-nln.e years ago
and wag a charter member of Pacific
Lodge No. 136, F. and A. M., of San
Francisco, where he lived many years.
Old Resident of Oakland Dead.
OAKLAND, Oct. 1. â Baxter Booth,
formerly superintendent of the Pacific
Nail Works when these were at the
foot of Market street. In this city, died
yesterday in Auburn at the horns of
his daughter, Mrs. J. P. Macauley. He
was 75 years old. He lived in Oak
land many years and was a prominent
member of the First Methodist Epis
copal Church. The remains arrived
here this evenlne and the funeral will
be held to-morrow from the church
named. The services -will be conducted
by the Rev. E. R. Dllle. Mr. Booth's
wife survives him.
BERKELEY, Oct. 1. â Simon Raun,
an employe of the Judson Powder
Works on the bay shore, was badly
burned about' the face this morning
while emptying a carboy of acid. The
acid splashed into his face at a crit
ical moment and burned deep Into the
flesh before he could wipe it off. He
was treated by Dr. Woolsey.
In concluding he said:
"The men who voted for the silver
heresy in 1896 may have done so; not
comprehending its radical vice. The
man who voted for it again in 1900 did
so, either avowing that he preferred the
success of hls^party to the welfare of
his country, or, confessing his Inability
to comprehend the bearings of a com
paratively simple economic problem.
"The people are now engaged In the
solemn business of considering whom
they shall choose. In my judgment,
they will choose wisely, because the
reasons which should govern a choice
are clear and conclusive.
. "The people know the past of the two
contending parties. They know the
policies for which they stand. They
know the effect upon the country's
welfare of administration under the
different policies. They know m tiie dif
ference between experience and inex
perience in public men. They know the
potency of influence with inexperienced
public servants, and they know how to
sympathize with, but avoid, a reputable
candidate whose political intimacies are
notoriously bad."
Charles Emory Smith followed Knox.
He said in part:
"This Presidential contest is an issue
between the party of achievement and
the party of fault-finding. The pri
mary question to be decided is whether
the American people want construction
or whether they want obstruction and
destruction. The choice lies between
the party that does things and the
party that breaks things.
"There never was quite so peculiar, a
campaign. Our opponents ask to be
put in power on the ground that they
admit for the last eight years they,
were all wrong. They ask that we be
put out of power because they ac
knowledge that during the same time
we were right. The highest merit
pointed to in the Democratic candidate
is that he. had the courage to send a
telegram to the effect that the Repub
licans had made the gold standard
fixed and irrevocable."
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 1.â Senator
Philander C. Knox to-night delivered
a speech that was considered important
because of his close relationship to
President Roosevelt and the prominent
part he has taken in events that have
become Issues in the national cam
paign. He spoke under the auspices of
the Manufacturers' Club of Philadel
phia, which opened the national cam
paign here to-night with a mass-meet
ing at the Academy of Music.
The auditorium was so crowded that
the doors were closed before the meet
ing began. Senator Knox was warmly
greeted by the audience, the enthu
siasm lasting for several minutes when
he arose to speak. Among those on the
platform were Senator Penrose, Mayor
Weaver and* a large number of State
and city officials. The following resolu
tions were unanimously adopted:
"Whereas, Succeeding four years of
disaster, depression, business stagna
tion and industrial paralysis under
Democratic rule, this country has for
nearly eight years enjoyed unprece
dented prosperity, surpassing all former
records In industrial development, ma
terial progress and in the general wel
fare of the people; and,
"Whereas, .This prosperity and na
tional development are ' the direct re
sult of the accession to power of the
present ruling party.
"Resolved, That it Js wisdom and
good policy to continue in power the
party through which the great results
recited have been attained.
"Resolved, That we reaffirm our be
lief in the principles of protection
through the operation of which our
great export trade of $500,000,000 of
our products has been built up, which
amount is but a small percentage of
our total manufactures, 95 per cent
of which we consume at home.
"Resolved, That in the Republican
candidates we recognize fit standard
bearers for the cause they represent."
Knox was then presented and spoke
for about an hour and a half. He was
frequently interrupted by applause.

NEW YORK, Oct. 1.â The stock
market gave another striking demon
stration of Its absorptive power to-day.
The movement of prices was rather
commonplace, but the volume of
transactions and the wide distribu
tion of business throughout the mar
ket gave evidence of a vitality greater
than at any time during the week.
The appearance of the unfavorable
bank statement was the signal for an
outburst of violent activity and a com
prehensive advance in prices.
The loss in cash was not so great
as foreshadowed by the week's outgo,
but the loan expansion kept up the
deposit item and the reserve require
ments so that the level of the surplus
declined some $6,659,100. But ster
ling exchange was weak again and an
inward movement of gold at an early
date seems highly probable. The grow
ing ease of the London money mar
ket will add to this probability. United
States steel preferred was again the
feature of the market, and the plac
ing of bets that the price would cross
that of the second mortgage bonds
was evidently intended to convey the
impression that the conversion of pre
ferred stock into these bonds was in
course of resumption.
Another jump in Northern Securi
ties on the curb also kept alive the
impression that a settlement of the
conflict among leading interests in that
company was being made. Profit tak
ing was in evidence at various times,
but the demand was sufficient to ab
sorb it readily. Growing confidence in
the general industrial and business out
look played Its part in the broadening
and strengthening market. The total
sales of bonds, par value, reached
$2,080,000.
A broad and active market has pre
vailed this week. The price movement
has been irregular and a^ times re
actionary, giving an impression of a
settling of the level of values to a
lower average. A closer analysis,
however, reveals that prices are rather
higher, if anything, than at the close
of last week. There has been a very
large volume of sales to realize profits,
and the evidence of the little damage
to prices which has resulted, is accept
ed as a striking demonstration of the
absorptive power and the underlying
strength of the market. This result
has not been attained without skillful
maneuvering and manipulation by ex
perienced operators and the employ
ment of lavish means. The rotation of
the supporting tactics from one set
of influential stocks to another has
left few important groups unaffected,
but the selling in some quarters in
large volume has gone hand-in-hand
with the lifting in another. 1
The market has been comparatively
free from disturbing factors in the way
of news,. and the strength has had the
help of a continuous stream of rumors
more or less plausible, but which have
been conspicuously lacking in confirm
ation. The most persistent of these
rumors have had to do with the great
transcontinental group of railroads.
There were numerous rumors of a
compromise agreed upon by the op
posing interests in the Northern Se
curities Company, which would allow
an immediate distribution of the as
sets of the company.

Sewer That Runs Up Hill.
The officials in the City Engineer's

In the proposed reconstruction of the
Fourth-street sewer, which is to be
carried but under the bond Issue. In
vestigations show that the sewer from
Harrison street to Channel is more
than half clogged with mud and at
two other points the sewer runs up
hill for a distance of more than 200
feet, so that the sewage runs back
from tidewater. The reconstruction
of the sewer will be a difficult matter
on that ' account.
Searches for Her Son.
Mrs. Emma ; Pallack of 139 Oak

on Thursday night and has asked the
aid of the police In finding her son,
Samuel Mails, 20 years of age, whom
she has not seen for three years. He
came here from Manila about six
weeks ago and put up at the Brooklyn
Hotel. A week ago yesterday he was
arrested on a charge of petty larceny,
but was released on Monday, as It was
proved that he was innocent- Since
then he has not been seen. Mrs..Pal
lack is staying at 324 Bush street.
but she applied for and was granted a
stay for one week, by. which time she
expects to have enough money to pay
a reasonable fine. She was disappoint
ed by the outcome of the Gans-Walcott
fight, she explained,' as she was confi
dent of the Barbadoes wonder's ability
to win and had backed him heavily, to
do so. The draw decision, however,
made her neither richer nor poorer, and
therefore the money she was so sure of
winning and with which she intended
to pay her fine failed to materialize.
Now she will draw upon a gentleman
friend in Los Angeles for the requisite
amount.

Joseph Smith, a contractor, was

Sansomo and Market streets. He told
Judge Mogan that his team and Mr.
Brizzalari's.team were as much alike
as peas In a pod, and this \ statement

Miss Clara Kerr (colored) was sched :

T. H. Spriogle, John Iverson, . John
Henson and BJorn BJornson, compris
ing the crew of the good scow schooner
Frederlcka Frederickson, were making
merry on the Barbary Coast when Mr.
Bjornson ran afoul of Patrolman Joy.
The officer had about made up his mind
to arrest Mr. Bjornson, Indeed had "col
lared" him,' when Mr. Spriogle butted
in and attempted to rescue. Then the
original prisoner was released and; Mr.
Spriogle substituted, and he behaved. so
obstreperously that several hard knocks
on the head with a club were required
to subdue him. Judge Mogan consid

and dismissed him with 'a caution.
' Miss Minnie Haskell declared that
Patrolman Kavanagh made a most
grievous mistake when he arrested her

Mogan, "and I'm sure this officer will
apologize for what he has done when I
tell him that there is no seamstress In
San Francisco who works harder than
I do."

kell, however, the policeman informed

Ten chubby children played hide
and-seek In the Hall of Justice corri
dors while Judge Mogan heard testi
mony as to whether they were as badly
treated by their custodian, August
Weinmann, as Mrs. Kate Pettle, man
ager of the Universal Service Society,
had alleged in her complaint. Mrs.
Baldwin, Mrs. Wyman, Miss Canty and
other persons residing in the vicinity
of Twenty-first and Castro streets,
where the defendant's home is situated,
testified that the little ones were very
well taken care of by Mr. Weinmann
and his wife and that they were not
cruelly punished. Nine-year-old Abe
Nathan stated that Mr. Weinmann hit
him with a strap one day as punish
ment for "playing hookey". from school,
but the blow did not hurt him very
much. Then the Judge continued the
case till next Saturday and intimated
that he will dismiss it.
Twenty milkmen convinced Judge
Cabaniss that they were not responsi
ble for the illegal proportion of cream
in the lacteal fluid served by them to
consumers, and the charge against
them was dismissed. When the Health
Board proceeds against the dairymen

it found once before, that the cows
that yielded the milk are solely to
blame for its thinness.
"Three months," gasped Mr. Haw

"Well, Mr. Hawkins," said the court
soothingly, "I hope you will not re

der for you. It is not prescribed in a
spirit of benevolence, I assure you."

"Guest nothin'," Interjected â¢ the po
liceman. "When he can't beg enough
to eat, your Honfcr, he washes dishes

whiskers; "hand my honly comment

"Eager to do what?"
. As he sat aloof from his fellow pris
oners In Police Judge Slogan's court
room* Edward Hawkins, accused of va
grancy, toyed with the frayed extremi
ties of his luxuriant whiskers and con
temptuously surveyed his environment.
His clothing was of ancient fashion,
his shoes were up at toe and down at
heel, and the linen that encircled -hi3
neck and wrists was soiled. : -.When a
negro misdemeanant accidently jostled
him a flush of anger lnumed his bloat
ed countenance and his hands involun
tarily clenched, but his Indignation; led
him to no further indiscretion -than to
glare furiously at the colored person,
who was serenely unconscious of the
wrath he had kindled. A moment later,
however, Mr. Hawkins condescended
to accept a brown paper cigarette from
the provoker of his. Ire. He- hurriedly
concealed the contraband article as he
advanced to the bench for trial.
The prosecuting testimony was brief
and convincing:. A policeman found
Mr. Hawkins fast asleep on . the sward
of Union Square at 2 o'clock yester
day morning and when awakened he
either would not or could not give sat
isfactory explanation of his conduct.
On several previous occasions he had
been seen loafing at unseasonable hours
in the same square by the same po
liceman.

said his Honor, interrogatively, to the
defendant.

PERSONAL.
The Supreme Court yesterday ren
dered a decision which will be of Im
portance to county officials. It was
in favor of the county of San Diego,
which sued John Schwartz. Treasurer
of the county, for $601 96, the sum
which had been collected by him as a
commission on collateral Inheritance
taxes.
The defendant held that he was en
titled to a commission of 6 per cent
on the first $50,000 collected. 8 per
cent on the next $50,000 and 1 per
cent on all over $100,000 collected by
him and accounted for. under section
20 of the act of 1893.
The provisions of section 216 of
the County Government Act bf 1893
reads: "The salaries and fees pro
vided in this act shall be In full com
pensation for all services of every kind
and description rendered by the offi
cers, attorney named either as offi
cers, or ex-officio officers, their depu
ties and assistants, unless in this act
otherwise provided."
It was held in effect first that the
salaries prescribed by the State act
were intended to compensate a State
officer in full for all services rendered
by him In his official capacity and that
he cannot retain for his own use
moneys collected by him while acting
in State capacity.

Sale of Corsets
Damaged by Water
During the recent storms in this city the warehouse of
the Royal Worcester Corset Company was flooded by water,
damaging several thousand pairs of corsets. Being the kind
of corsets, however, that wash and have rust-proof steels,
there is little damage except that some of them are damp and
slightly stained, and in some cases you would not be wiser
unless you were told.
These corsets, many of them in perfect condition, repre-
sent the best styles made by the Royal Worcester Corset
Company, and were just received by freight two days previous
to the storm.
They will be placed on sale in our Corset Department
to-morrow morning, on the third floor, without reserve. All
sizes are represented, both in white, drab and black.

Few People Know How Ussfal It Is in Pre-
'{;> - serving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest^ and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and Impurities always present
In the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system,
j Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic. **v
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the 'stomach and bowels; It
disinfects the mouth and throat - from
the poison of catarrh. .
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, butprobably the best
charcoaland the most for the money la
in Stuart's . Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest , powdered
Willow charcoal.' and other, harmless
antiseptics in tablet' form or rather, in
the form of large, pleasant tasting }oz-
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.- . â¢ / â¢ - ...
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex- j
ion,, sweeter breath and purer blood, ]
and the beauty of it is that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use, but, on the contrary, great, benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking - of
the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels, and .to. clear .the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal In Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the '
ordinary charcoal tablets." I

â¢-Â»o& 111 to 121 Post Street 'gg!MComes Hamlet then, Ben Greet him
self. Mr. Greet, Miss Constance Craw
ley and John Sayer Crawley, by the
way, are the only members of the last
year's company over here this year. If
'twere not "Hamlet," as when Bur
bage played, one might take excep
tion to the Greet portrait But surely
Shakespeare tore his hair occasionally?
I can Imagine him sometimes almost as
much annoyed as Mr. J. C. Crawford
is about "Miss Mazuma" as Fischer's
libel It I must confess that I person
ally prefer a commonplace accuracy in
the lines to begin with to the variety
of paraphrase In which, Mr. Greet yes
terday indulged. Had I written it so:
For usÂ« almost can change the stamp of na
ture.
I should vainly It prefer to thÂ»
For usÂ» almost can break off custom
That Mr. Greet likes better. And
scores of such changes might be in
stanced. Bad stage management, Mr.
Shakespeare, I should call it. Neither
'does it conduce to illusion to have Ho
ratio prompting the melancholy prince
from a book hidden under his cloak,
nor to hear a silver-voiced person be
hind the arras doing the same.
We may be hypercritical these days,
but I fear,, gentle William, that Mr.
Belasco would not give you your salt
as a stage manager!
As a characterization, Mr. Greet's
Hamlet on the comedy side Is delight
fully sufficient. Gently cynical, lightly
touched in plastic, it is here a witty
and eloquent picture. Like those of all
his players, Mr. Greet's voice and
enunciation are constantly charming.
Every word is clear cut and in absolute
emotional tune. Hardly so convincing
one finds him on the tragic side. More
of a "reading" than a characterization
one finds the impersonation here.
Hamlet, the tortured accuser of his
mother, the Hamlet roused to a spas
modic fire-eating, one hardly gets the
spirit of. One finds again a substantial
philosophical quality In the portrait
But Mr. Greet is a comedian, and on
this side notably satisfies. From the
picturesque side he is a better Malvolio.
Laertes, spirited, virile, human,
was admirably essayed by John faayer
Crawley. He struck most gratefully
the human quality in his delivery, and
to look at made a lithe and handsome
Dane. Constance Crawley was the
Ophelia, and with a fragile delicacy
of charm in her mad scene. She,
however, notably sinned against the
integrity of the lines, Mr. Shake
speare. Slightly melodramatic, too.
were her emotional moments, but
there was a wistful, girlish quality in
the work, poetry, charm that lingers
gratefully with one.
To Leonard Shepherd fell the part
of the king. Mr. Shepherd evidently
felt the responsibility. However, but
that it became monotonous one liked
not wholly the pompous strut of it
Polonlus was good â but who ever saw
a bad one? â sage, sententious, oh!
the droll humor of him! And the
gravedigger! Three hundred years ago
they laughed as we laughed yesterday
as Maurice Robinson spouted hi3 ple
beian wisdom.
Helena Head was the queen, and
full stately, with a notable emotional
grip.
After all, the play's the thing.
"Hamlet" cannot be spoiled by any
company of players from Petaluma to
Tibet And Mr. Greet's are not of
the worst of these. The "curtain fell"
splendidly on the cannons of the new
King Fortinbras and for the first time
one saw the dead carried out And
one' will not easily forget it â or tha
rest

HUNDREDS HO3EELESS.
Peter Orubirn, who signs himself a
taxpayer, filed a protest yesterday with
City Treasurer McDougald against pay
ing any salary to Police Commissioner
H. W. Hutton since September 27, 1904,
The protest says:
"Your official attention Is directed to
the fact that on September 27, 1904. one
H. W. Hutton, a Police Commissioner.
was by the Superior Court therein con
victed of an offense involving a willful
violation of the official duties of his of
fice, and that by virtue of said, convic
tion and under the provisions of sec
tion 10 of article XVI of the charter of
San Francisco the office of Police Com
mlssiqner theretofore held by the said
H. W. Hutton is vacant, and you are
hereby required to refrain and abstain
from paying to the said H. W. Hutton
any salary or compensation upon any
claim made by him for services per
formed as said Police Commissioner
since September 27, 1904."
The protest was also signed by
Beorge D. Collins as attorney for Oru
birn, who is credited with having
threatened to have Hutton ousted from
office.
The protest was received by Deputy
Treasurer Louis A. Devoto at 12 o'clock,
but too late to be y of any effect on Hut
ton's September salary of $100, as the
money was paid over to him at ID
o'clock. Treasurer McDougald cannot
do anything else but recognize the pro
test, but in order to determine if it has
any merit the question will be submit
ted to City Attorney Long for an opin
ion.
Under the charter a municipal office
becomes vacant if the incumbent there
of is convicted of a violation of his of
ficial duties. The point at Issue is
whether Hutton In ordering the arrest
of inmates of the resort at 1129 Dupont
street in violation of Judge Cook's in
junction has willfully violated his of
ficial duties, and the City Attorney will
be asked to look up the law on the
point.
For. five days this ' week, beginning
to-morrow afternoon, the teachers and
pupils of the public schools, with their
hosts of friends, will make merry at
the Chutes. For months preparations
have been under way to afford a week
of fun for all seeking amusement, and

pared for each day. The proceeds of
the week will go to a worthy cause, the
Teachers' Annuity Fund, and It is ex
pected th#t the friends of the educat
ors of children will come forward with
their customary liberality.
To-morrow will be Pacific Heights
day and the week's entertainment will
be opened with a chorus from that
school. In the casino an entertainment
will be held from 2 to 3 o'clock In the
afternoon, after which the floor will
be cleared for dancing.
Apart from the regular programme
there will be side entertainments in
plenty and it is suggested that a lib
eral supply of dimes and nickels will
be very useful to those who wish to
"take in" everything.
The grab bag with its wealth of un
known treasures, the fishpond, from
which anglers may draw forth prizes
unknown to ocean's depths, the wonder
tree, the treasure ship and a host of
other amusements will occupy the time
and attention of both young and old.

GRASS VALLEY, Oct. 1.â Miss Ber
tha Horsfall of Woodland has com
menced a suit in the Superior Court of
Nevada County against Willis A.
Clinch, a well known business man of
this city, charging him with breach
cf promise. She demands that the
court order Clinch to pay to her the
modest sum of $10,000 in coin of the
realm as a balm for her injured feel
ings.
The young woman states in her com
plaint that she purchased a handsome
and costly trousseau and gave up her
place as a student of nursing in the
Waldeck Hospital in anticipation of
becoming Mrs. Clinch: that she is high
ly educated and of extremely nervous
temperament; that she is accustomed
to move in polite and refined society,
and that by reason of Clinch's alleged
failure to carry out his promise of mar
riage she is deeply grieved and morti
fied.
She further alleges that the defend
ant in the suit occupies a high social
position and moves among men of
wealth, and that when they became
betrothed he promised when they be
came one to Install her in a beautiful
home. As an evidence of his professed
affection Â£he avers he presented her
with a beautiful and costly diamond
ring.
Clinch's lawyers say they Â¦ have ' no
fear as to the outcome of the suit and
do not believe their client is at all
alarmed. When the case Is called ' for
trial they say they will be prepared
to show that if Mr. Clinch was really
engaged to the - plaintiff and subse
quently broke the engagement, he had
ample and sufficient cause for the ac
tion. â¢ s,.~.: .
The defendant is one of the substan
tial business men of the county, is
hiphly connected and regrets the un
favorable notoriety forced upon him.
Miss Horsfall visited Grass Valley a
few months ago as the guest of
Clinch's mother.

Will Arrest Shrimp Catchers.
Deputy Health Officer Louis Levy

tors of the Health Department to
swear to warrants for the arrest of
John Doe, Richard Roe and Gustave
VIdeau, members of the San Mateo
Shrimp Company, doing business in
the basement, at 708 Sacramento
street. In October, 1899, the Board
of Health condemned the shrimp beds
at Butchertown and for more than
four years no shrimps were J taken
from the place. Health Officer Ragan
in his report submitted to the -board
a few days ago stated that the action
of the board was being, nullified by
certain parties and. he recommended
their arrest. The board approved this
recommendation. It is alleged < that
the San Mateo - Shrimp . Company is
using shrimps caught at Butchertown
in violation of the "ordinance, and the
members of the firm will: be arrested.

George Probasco of P. W. Bellingall
& Co. received from Canada yesterday
morning copies of. the new Canadian
law regulating the manner in which
shipments from the. United States into
Canada shall be certified.
The custom hitherto has been to send
ordinary shippers' bills with a stamp,
reciting that the values as stated are
correct. The new act went into effect
yesterday and is very stringent in its
provisions. It requires the shipper .to
state the quantities and description of
the goods, the fair market value as
sold for home consumption and the
selling price to the purchaser in Can
ada. Certification must be made to
the following facts: â¢ . . , :
"That the A said invoice also exhibits
the fair market value of the said goods
at the time and place of their direct
exportation to Canada and as when
sold at the same time and place in
like quantity and condition for home
consumption, in the principal markets
of the country whence exported di
rectly to Canada without anv discount
or deduction for cash, or. on account
of any drawback or bounty, or on
account of any royalty actually paya
ble thereon when sold for home con
sumption but not payable when ex
ported, or on account of the exporta
tion thereof or for any special consid-.
eration whatever.
"That , no different Invoice of the
goods mentioned, in said Invoice has
been or will be furnished to any one;
and that . no arrangement or. under
standing affecting- the purchase price
of the said goods has been or will be
made or. entered Into between the said
exporter and purchaser, or. by any one
on behalf of either" of them, either by
way of discount, rebate, salary, com
pensation, or. In any manner, whatso
ever other than is shown in the said
invoice. . , . 9 ,. ,' '.-...
"Whereas, German goods are subject
to surtax in Canada, I , certify that
none of the . articles included 1 in this
invoice are the produce or manufac
ture of Germany, and that the chief
value of none of, said articles was
produced In Germanyâ save, and ex
cept all articles which the
word 'Germany"' is written on this
invoice." - .-':...-'
The price and value of the goods' in
every case, aforesaid are to be stated
as in condition. packed ready for ship
ment at the" time when and at the

No deduction from the value, of
goods shall be â¢ made on . account ' of
charges j for packing , or straw, twine,

TRINIDAD, Colo., Oct. 1.âAl
though reports continue to be circu
lated to-day that several families have
been missing since the flood swept
through the city yesterday, no bodies
have been recovered, arid the police
announce that they have no reason to
believe that there was any loss of life.
The - property^ loss will approximate
$1,000,000, being even greater in many
Instances than at first supposed. The
damage to the Colorado and Wyoming
Railroad is fully $75,000, in addition
to the weakening of the $50,000
bridge -at, Sopris, which may fall.
Two' miles of track between Sop
ris and Jansen â¢ are -gone. One
thousand feet of Santa ! Fe track
is in the river at Jansen and the
bridge at Starkville is gone. The
Colorado and Southern roadbed in
Riley Canyon is wrecked, twenty- four
bridges having been washed away.
. A special meeting of the City Coun
cil was held to-day to devise measures
for the relief of flood sufferers. Con
struction' of a temporary water main
to the south side to replace the mains
that were washed away was begun.
The Las Animas River to-day is at

Scenes From tfye Production of Hamlet as Given by the Ben Greet Cqmpaoyip the Greek Theater at Berkeley.
Tages37to48
.; : : : i *.
' Pages 37 to 48 '
4â : -i-
"Opposite 'Hamlet' in the repertoire
that Mr. Greet gave his advance agent
he wrote 'universities only." The reason
I suppose was his appreciation of the
fact that only In a university commu
nity could he find many who would be
interested In a serious attempt to give
the play as It was prepared for the
stage by Shakespeare himself, and in
some such manner as it was acted dur
ing his lifetime."
Thus spoke Professor W. D. Armes.
one of our most serious and scholarly
students of the drama, on the Ideal of
the "Hamlet" performance given at the
Greek Theater yesterday by Ben
Greet's company of players.
Professor Armes quotes also In the
afore-quoted leaflet Austin Dobson's
opinion of how it was "when Burbage
played. the title role and Shakespeare
the ghost in the Globe Theater, just 300
years ago." Mr. Dobson believes that
When Burbage played the stage was bare
Of fount and temple, tower and stair;
Two backswords eked a battle out.
Two supers made a rabble rout;
The throne of Denmark was a chair.
And yet, no less the audience there
Thrilled through all changes of despair,
Hope, anger, fear, delight and doubt,
When Burbage played!
Further, yesterday's programme rath-
s er naively informed that "the present
performance should not be judged as
an ordinary theatrical performance" â
though whether to regard it as a Kolb
and Dillic or a Mansfield chef-d'oeuvre*
is left handsomely to one's discretion.
This the programme promised, how
ever: "No new readings will . be at
tempted, the whole endeavor being to
give the play, with the scenes Usually
omitted, in a primitive manner as near
ly, as possible like that in which it was
produced just 300 years ago."
Thus the manager of yesterday's
production â whom I know not. The
programme, delicately reticent cor
cernlng the cast, is also alluringly mys
terious here.
It is to be admitted that without the
aforesaid sign . posts the errant critic
might have lost his way. He might
have been tempted to "Judge the per
formance as an ordinary theatrical per
formance." He might have bothered his
head about small matters like correct
lines, . emphasis and sich, or stubbed
his toes upon "new readings." Being
relieved from these necessities, he has
only to say how he like? "Hamlet" as
it was done "with the Ghost by Mr.
Shakespeare" 300 years ago.
There were probably 3000 people at
the Greek Theater. Fairer' morning
than yesterday's even Shakespeare
never hymned â luckily, for "Parsifal"
fashion, we took our "Hamlet" in in
stallments, the first at the heartless
hour of half past 11 a. m. The theater
itselfâ but where is George Sterling to
.immortalize its grave loveliness?
'Twould, as yesterday it rose stately
into the washed skies and clean green
of the trees, turn a Punch and Judy
show into an epic!
- As .when Burbage played the bugle
summoned us inside. There we found
the Elizabethan stage, with its two,
three chairs, a table, a small platform
with steps and so on, to which Mr.
Greet has already accustomed us."
You will remember that Bernardo says
almost at the outset that " 'tis now
struck twelve." The morning laughed
at the mimic midnight. But, magically,
in a phrase or two, night fell, and the
Ghost stalked in amid strange fears
lent by the day. Curious, too. He â the
programme denies his name â was a
rather dapper little ghost. He had - a
strictly corporal string or two hanging
from his ghostly garb, and â nails in his
shoes. Yet the "feel" of the scene was
mysteriously there. -f â¢. ,. ., .<WEATHER REPORT.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 1.
â -Jhe Stanford University football
eleven turned the tables on the Olym
pic team this afternoon, defeating the
visitors by a score of 12 to 0. These
figures show, the comparative merits
of the two teams to-day. The club
team was just as strong as it was two
weeks ago when it trimmed the Car
dinals 6 to 0, but the Stanford eleven
showed the results of consistent train
ing and outclassed its opponents.
The Cardinal team started the scor
ing early in the game, while the first
choice men were on the field. The
kick-off came to Olympic, but they lost
the ball finally on the forty-five yard
line. By the fierce tackle plays of
Thompson and the bucking of the Car
dinal backs, the ball was forced to
Olympic's two-yard line. It was the
third down with two yards to make,
and Stott sent Weller through the
line. The big fullback struck hard,
and the ball was forced out of his
hands; ' rolling behind the" goaF posts.
In the struggle it lay for a moment
unnoticed, but* Captain Clark fell on
it and scored for the collegians. Stott
easily 'kicked the goal.
The second touchdown was made by
Brennan, substitute halfback, in the
first few minutes of the second half. It
was an end play and Brennan fought
for forty-one yards to the goal posts,
throwing off would-be tacklers by
whirling in his tracks.
To-day's game showed the Stanford
offense was perhaps better developed
than its defense. Both Stott and Bans
bach ran the plays off fast, using the
tackles formation most successfully.
The weak point on both defense and
offense, however, was the Cardinal
center trio. It is with these men that
Coach Lanagan will work the hardest
from now on. Slaker and Bishop made
repeated gains through the line. Big
Cavanaugh, of the -Olympics, toyed
with the Stanford center. The work
of Thomas, at end, Keegan, at guard,
and Mooney, at quarter and end, on
the Olympic team, was especially good.

The Lick School football eleven ad
ministered a crushing defeat yesterday
to the Lowell High School team. Lowell
was completely outclassed and at no
stage of the game had a chance to
score. . Lick piled up a total of 30 points
as against nothing for Lowell, It was
the first time Lick has beaten Lowell
since 1900. The only man who was aÂ£
all in evidence in the Lowell team was
Captain Cerf, the left halfback. He
played throughout the game with a lig
ament of his ankle broken, and was
barely able to hobble about. He backed
up the line cleverly and was always at
the bottom of the heap. Cerf has the
making of a^ star, his style of play re
sembling that of Jules Frankenheimer,
the great Stanford back.
Lick played an excellent, 'game and
developed a man who bids fair to be
come the premier kicker of the league.
This is Right Halfback Deitz, who
punted several times for forty yards.
Aside from his kicking Deitz; was. the
star. , His end running was ''{he best
seen this year and usually netted his
team ffpm.tenjto thirty yards. He did
some^ of the most h scientific "fumbling
ever "seen ori^ the Ideal i gridiron. He
made at least' six fiimbles on' each of
which his team gained anywhere from
five to fifty yards. "Lick fumbled con
stantly, but had all the luck and al
ways regained the ball for a substan
tial gain.
Cerf was the only man on the Lowell
team who was able to gain any ground,
but he was in no shape to do much
running. He was unable to punt, and
this task fell to Lynn. The latter's first
two kicks were blocked and resulted in
touchdowns for Lick. On an exchange
of punts Lick gained about twenty
yards each time.
Snell, Lick's fullback, did some great
line bucking. Several times he went
clear through the line and was stopped
by the .man in the .back r fleld.
In the first half Lick scored three
touchdowns and a safety. Lowell's
center, who was a substitute, was re
sponsible for the safety. In an attempt
to kick from the ten-yard line he passed
the ball over Lynn's head and back of
the goal line.
The second half was a repetition of
the first. Lowell was always on the de
fensive and only once gained its five
yards: By using Snell to buck and
Deitz to run the end. Lick scored twice
in the second half and had the ball on
Lowell's two-yard line at the call of
time.
Lick's team work was' good yester
day, her interference being the best
seen up to date. If Lick and Polytech
nic come together on Tuesday after
noon there will' 'be a hot game. It is
expected Lick will get the game on a
protest, as Polytechnic did not register
in time.

The Indians kicked thirty yards to
Oliver on the start. He came back five
and Sperry got through for four yards
twice. I-assater fumbled and the red
efcins' owned the ball. California held
pat and when she got the pigskin
Srperry made another four-yard gain.
The Indians held and Force kicked
thirty-five yards and past the center of
the field. The red men were compelled
to return the compliment and Shoulder
cunted back forty yards.
BLUE AND ; GOLD SCORES.
There was a great deal of splendid
individual work. There were several
runs of twenty yards or more, and the
tackling generally was strictly up to
date. The attendance was rather light
on account of rival attractions, but
those who were there had a run for
their money. The weather was a few
degrees warm for football, but the field
was in superb condition.
Sperry, the California freshman,
demonstrated to the satisfaction of
every one present that he is of varsity
caliber. He cannot as yet punch a hole
through a stone wall, like Jim Weller,
but if all goes well he should make a
name for himself later on. Then there
was a certain blue and gold half called
Mead who ran like a frightened deer
and held the ball like a veteran when
he was hurled down and jumped upon,*
The other backs did fine work too.
Payne of the redskins did some spec
tacular playing. He almost got through,
for a touchdown on a fake in the first'
half. As it was, he secured twenty-five
yards for his team. \, % - -.
The punting on the whole was'excel
lent, the team play was unusually fine
and* the interference was creditable.'
California fumbled considerably at the'
start! but improved wonderfully in this;
respect before the first half was done.?
The blue and gold was stronger;, both;

team work of the - Indians was sttpefior.i

GA3IE IS SPECTACULAR.
There was a rare game of real foot
ball at Berkeley yesterday between the
warriors of the blue and gold and a
valiant band of copper-hued braves
from the Sherman Institute in South
ern California. The palefaces car
ried off the palm of victory with a
touchdown and a goal for its mate, but
the aborigines won some honors as
well. Such contests are not frequently
seen on the gridiron. It was clean and
vigorous football from the kickoff to
the last call of the referee's whistle.
Both teams were in amazingly fine
condition for this time of -the season.
The officials handled the game briskly
and the wrangles were few. To be sure,
both eleven? showed elements of weak
ness and the play might have been
faster, but, all things considered, it was
a game which will linger pleasantly in
the memory of those who witnessed it.
The roughness whichmarked the last
struggle between California and the
Sherman school eleven was absent, and
the managers of both teams promised
after the game that the tomahawk,
which had been buried, should never be
dug up. It was California's "first game
this season, and the team loomed up
strong enough to have given the lads
of the cardinal a bad case of chilis had
they been there to witness. The blue
and gold line was as strong and as,un
yielding as the cliffs of Goat Island,
and most^of the backs would have put
Caesar's catapults out of business in
competition. It is high time for Stan
ford to forget about having a holdover
team and get down to work.
.After-he fell his team picked him up
and carried him five yards more. Cali
fornia's goal was only eight yards
away and it began to look dark for the
palefaces. The supporters of the Blue
and Gold were equal to the occasion,
however, and nailed the visiting backs
right on the â¢ rushline. The Indians
missed a fine chance to try a field goal
and surrendered the ball.
Force kicked over the sideline and
the Indians had the pigskin close to
the goal again. Two rushes were fu
tile, and just as they were getting
ready for a heave altogether, the ref
eree sounded his whistle for the end
of the half with the ball six yards
from California's goal.
At the beginning of the second
period both teams were strong and
eager. Each eleven held on necessary
occasions and punted cleverly when
compelled to do so. Once when the
pigskin was in the hands of the In
dians on their twenty- five yard line
Force broke through and blocked the
kick. After a couple of fruitless
rushes. Force was ordered back to try
for a field goal. He didn't come within
forty rows of apple trees of making it.
The redmen kicked past the center
when the ball was brought out to the
twenty-flve yard line. California car-:
ried the ball steadily up the field with
end and line plays working to perfec
tion and. made her touchdown in the
manner described in the foregoing.
California kicked off and the In
dians immediately made thirty yards
on a fake: punt, but were forced to
kick .without further .gain. Mead made
another sensational run of thirty yards
and Graves got -ten on the next play.
The ball was â¢ then Â¦ forced up to the
Indians' five yard' line. Another touch
down seemed certain when .the game
was ended'by the whistle. The lineup

the ball went back past center. The
Indians kicked back to the blue and
gold forty- yard line after a couple of
scrimmages. , ,
Â¦ Sperry made ten yards through left
tackle and end with the assistance of
Lassater, who picked up the ball after
a fumble. Here the visitors compelled
a punt, which was returned with five
yards' interest after the red men had
made two ineffectual attempts lo punc
ture the opposing' line. . After a few
scrimmages and another exchange of
kicks, it was the Inidans' ball in the
center. Magee made fifteen yards
around left end and Payne made two
through right tackle. Here the Sher
man team made a bluff at a tandem
play through the opposing right tackle
and after a delayed pass Payne slipped
around the enemy's left end for twenty
five yards.

MEAD MAKING A SENSATIONAL TWENTY-FIVE YARD ItUN IN THE FOOTBALL GAME ON BERKELEY CAMPUS YESTERDAY WITH SHERMAN INDIANS.
From developments yesterday it
seems Jimmy Brltt's next opponent
will be Joe Gans Instead of Young Cor
bett. Britt figures that if he defends
his featherweight championship title
first and should lose to Corbett there
would be no chance of a match with
Gans. Ir he could not beat Corbett
he surely could not lower the colors of
the Baltimore whirlwind.
On the other hand it he lost to Gana
he could claim that he went out of hi3
class and the Corbett match would still
be a desirable one. If the Gans match
ia made it will probably be decided \
late in November when the racing con
tingent will be here. If Britt beats
Gans at 133 he would probably want
to make Corbett scale 132 pounds,
which would be a better weight for
the Californian.
It is estimated the Brltt-Oans
fight would draw more than $40,000.
It would be a wonderful betting 'fight.
as each boxer has a host of followers.
There is a lot of political wirepull
ing behind the scenes regarding box
ing. The fate of the game for the bal
ance of this year will be decided short
ly. If it is stopped here all the big
fights will be held In Colma, where the
authorities are friendly.
Referee Jack Welch showed his rec
ord of the rounds in the Gans-Wal
cott flght yesterday. He gave Gana
seven rounds, Walcott five and called
eight even.
It is evident he judged the bout
from the fighting point of view entire
ly. Gans received no credit for the con
stant fire of blows he rained on YVal
cott, as they did not stop that remarka
ble fighter. That some of them had
terrible force was shown when he fair
ly lifted Walcott off his feet on two oc
casions.
It i3 the opinion of Gans* friends
that he gave the grandest exhibition of
clean hitting and clever blocking ever
seen here. He is confident he can make
133 pounds ringside and still be at hi3
best.
Walcott cannot fight for months on
account of his injured arm.

Jimmy Whalen did not get in right
Â¦when the game started. He lacked that
confidence and dash, and every one
could see something was wrong. After
the first there was nothing 1 to it, for
Jimmy could hurl the leather where he
"wanted to, and the Angels were power
less to crack it safely except in the
eighth round.
Baum pitched a beautiful game, and
if his support was anything like
Â¦\Vhalen's Uncle would have been hand
ed the liig blank. He weakened a little
in the ninth spasm, allowing a hit and
passing the only one. But a fast double
play was then pulled off and he was out
of the woods before any damage re
sulted.
Flood got a hit to center in the first,
and then Smith made the second out.
Â¦Cravath was passed. Then Chase bit
off a Texas leaguer back of first. It
scored Flood and sent Cravath to third.
Toman then swung through, bringing
Cravath in, and Ross' bingle allowed
Chase to arrive.
This lead of three tallies took the gin
ger out of Uncles gladiators, but at
that they commenced to show a bit of
tight in the second. Meany had hit, but
Irwin forced him at second and went
there himself on Flood's overthrow to
first. Andy waded into a fast one, and
while ricss was hot-footing after it way
out by the fence Irwin tallied and Andy
pulled up at second. Another misplay
put Go( hnauer on the sacks and a
double steal was immediately transact
ed, Andy registering the last run for
Uncle.
The game went along rapidly for the
next six rounds, with both pitchers
working well and getting swell support.
Bernard ushered in the eighth with a
double to the score board, and a couple
of sacrifices by Flood and Smith put
him safely over the jumps. Meany tore
off a single in the ninth and Irwin drew
a. four spot. Anderson's grounder to
Toman was quickly transformed into a
double play, and then the finish.
Gorton was weak on throwing to
liases, and the Angels therefore got
busy on the sacks and stole six times.
Irwin furnished the circus part of the
game in the ninth, when he went into
the air and took Toman's drive with
one mitt. The score:
Pan Francisco â LoÂ« Angeles â
The first inning was where the south
rons figured.. Three runs came trailing
home after twu had been put ir*to the
cellar. The work was done quickly.
This "was enough to carry 'cm through,
(hough the Seals made a couple of
Strong bids, one as late as the ninth in
ning:. A double play, however, broke
the latter up and the fans went home.
The Ar.gcls have acquired that ga.it
that makes the pennant look nearer
and dearer. They won't let Uncle get a
peep in at all any more. Yesterday
made the third straight the Seals have
Buffered, and if this thing: keeps on it
Â¦will look like a funeral parade, with
the music getting slower and slower ail
the time. Scoreâ Los Angeles 4, ' San
Francisco 2.

of the disease, I was truly in a bad shape
when I began the use of S. S, S., but the
persistent use of it brought me put of my

"Weakness"
. What ia commonly termed functional
weakness Is merely a symptom of proa-
tatic disorder. To stimulate activity by
the use of powerful tonics is an easy mat-
ter, but such results are merely temporary
Â¦ Srag effects. Moat doctors treat "weak-
ness" In this manner because they do not
know how to cure the real cause of the
derangement. I am the only physician
employing scientific and successful metn-
ods. I use no tonics at all. My treatment
is a local nnÂ» entirely, and corrects every
abnormal condition of that vital center, the

The suspension of Robert Smith,
lessee and driver of Sweet Marie. Is
still causing lots of speculation as to
Its final outcome. Secretary Moone
of Providence went to Hartford and
released the suspension against Mr.
Smith, but the stewards of the Grand
Circuit immediately held a meeting
and renewed it, at the same time ex
cepting the mare from their decision.
Section 6 of rule 27, National Trotting
Association rules, distinctly states that
in cases of suspensions of this kind
"all the guilty parties, together with
the horse, shall be suspended for not
less than one year or shall be ex
pelled. How the Grand Circuit stew
ards have power to alter this rule is
bothering horsemen a good deal. It
may be that protests will be entered
against the starting of Sweet Marie
In any more races until the suspension
of Mr. Smith is removed. > ;i
A battle royal is expected at the
Memphis meeting, when Lou Dillon
and Major Delmar meet in the second
leg of the $5000 gold cup race for
amateur drivers. Mr. Billings won the
first race last year in hollow fashion,
both heats being in 2:04^. Every
one expects, this time to be beaten this
year. Major* Delmar has already
trotted four public trials below 2:03
and Lou Dillon has trotted a work-out
mile in 2:02 and repeated twenty-five
minutes later In 2:03, with the last
quarter in 30 seconds. The champion
mare is evidently as fast as ever and
her trainer thinks she is a bit faster.
Mr. Smathers, owner ,of M-ajor Del
mar, has grreat confidence, however,
that he will win the race this year
and that if he is beaten it will not
be in straight heats.
The Kentucky Futurity was estab
lished in 1S93, and this will be the elev
enth renewal of what Is recognized as
the greatest stake for three-year-old
trotters. The fastest heats since Its
inauguration have ranged from 2:16%,
made by Oakland Baron in 1S95, to
2:10%, made by Fereno in 1900. Sadie
Mac won it last year and her fastest
heat was 2:12%. Of this year's probable
starters Alta Axworthy has already
trotted to a record of 2:10VÂ£, Lord Rev
elstroke to one of 2:12*4, Grace Bond
one in 2:11*4 and Princess Athelhas won
In 2:14. Gazote, a Palo Alto bred colt,
will doubtless start. He won a race re
cently in 2:16V4 and is credited with a
trial of 2:12. Harry McKerron, son of
the California champion John A. Mc-
Kerron 2:04*4. will also be a starter, as
will Colonel J. C. Klrkpatrick's Elden
Bells, by Monbells, although neither
has yet shown speed enough to be fig
ured on as probable winners. As sec
ond horse will get 52000, third 51000 and
fourth 5500, the field of starters will
doubtless be a large on?.
California horses are still winning
money on the Grand Circuit, and hard
ly an Important race is decided that a
trotter or pacer from this State does
not get a share of it. Up to the Colum
bus meeting:, which was held last week,
California horses had won over $1000
each as follows:
TROTTERS.

It is a curious fact that California
produces fewer pacers than any State i
that makes any pretension to breeding
harness horses. Its record of ten new
2:10 trotters this season leads all pre- :
vious records.
The great annual meeting of the Ken
tucky Trotfing Horse Breeders' Asso
ciation will open at Lexington next
week. The $5000 Transylvania and the
521,000 Kentucky .Futurity are the prin
cipal events. In the Transylvania,
which is for 2:12 class trotters named
September 12, the following horses are
expected to start: Tuna 2:09U, Consu
ela 2:07%, Hal Fry. 2:09^4, Tiverton 2:07,
George G 2:06U. Snyder McGregor
2:09}i. Sweet Marie 2:06U. Anaconda
2:09^2, Peter Sterling 2:lUi, Kent 2:10
and Angiola 2:0SU. This will make one
of the greatest fields that has ever
j lined up for this classic event. The race
will probably be between Sweet Marie,
Tiverton, Consuela S and George G,
and the horse that wins will be likely
to lower his record in the race. The his
tory of this great annual event, which
was established in 1SS9, is as follows:

Grand Annual Meeting in
Kentucky Will Bring Out
the .Cream of All Stables
CJRAVESEND, Oct. Lâ "With two j
popular stakes on the card the races
to-day attracted a large attendance, in
spite of the condition of the weather.
It -was the closing day of the Brooklyn
Jockey Club's fall meeting.
The Oriental handicap, for three
year-olds and upward, was by all odds
the more popular of the two stakes. A
representative field went to the post for
it. it included Caughnawaga, Afri
cander, Lord cf the Vale. Dainty, Gun
fire, Eugenia Barch, Proper and Alan
a-Dale.
Rounding the first turn, Alan-a-Da!e
en the outside made a strong bid to
get xzd to the pacemakers. Dainty and
Lord cf the Vale. Odorn, on Proper,
was a length behind Dainty at thÂ«
ctretcfc turn. He thought to take ad
vantage cf an opening which then
existed, but the two leaders closed over
and Proper ran in a pocket for more
than a furlong.
Lord cf the Vale was on Proper's
right. Thus the horses ran, Dainty win
r-irg by a neck from Lord of the Vale,
Â«-h!ch beat Proper half a length. Alan
e-Pa2e was a close fourth. Summary:

CHICAGO. Oot. Lâ "Virginia" Brad
ley's Ahola, a mare of many surprises,
ran the best race of her career to-day
at Worth by galloping away from a
food field In the Calumet handicap.
Ahola was a 10 to 1 shot in the betting.
Starter Murray dispatched the eleven
horses to a prompt and an even send
off, with the Eastern crack Tribes Hill
first to show In front. He attempted to
make the running, but Ahola outfooted
him around the first turn and bade
good-by to her company. The farther
Ahola went the better she got. By the
time the stretch was reached she was
palling along six or- eight lengths in the
lead, finally winning pulled up by four
lengths from Reservation, which beat
out Brancas in the last two Jumps for
second money. Reservation and Che
boygran, coupled as the Hendrie entr>'i
were the favorites, with Brancas the
best supported of the others. The purse
had a gross value of 52*60, the winner's
share being $1950.
Delightful fall weather attracted a
large crowd to the pretty country
course. The track was still in bad con
dition, but drying out fast.
The Durnell-Tennes combination
failed to make a coup in the first race,
when The Fog, after being backed from
4 to 1 to 14 to 5, was beaten at the wire
by Dod Anderson, an 8 to 1 chance.

YESTERDAY was the 'first of the month;
had -you been at our office to see several of
our customers who were paying their monthly
installments you would have observed on their
countenances a' smile of satisfaction. Instead
of getting a rent receipt, . they obtained a
receipt for payment on a -'home" built by us.
They know every payment brings them so
much nearer ' paying for the "home," using 1
the same rent money which they threw away
In the past. We can place you In the tame
position, why then delay it and throw your
hard earned, money away?
We have made- a great. many purchases dur-

"REXRADIO" In Europe had the honor of
the patronage of Queen Alexandra,, Princes
George. Albert and Bismarck; also of many
Other noble and distinguished personages.
"REXRADIO" has successfully treated multi-
tudes of (alleged) "incurable" cases of al-
most every known disease:
"REXRADIO'S" offices thronged all last
week; every patient wonderfully benefited;
testimonials signed by patients and numer-
ous witnesses at office.
"THUNDER" unheard; â¢ patients last week
each having one ear (totally) deaf to loud-
est sounds. Including "thunder," were
promptly enabled to hear (distant) "whis-
pered" conversation. Testimonials shown.
"REXRADIO'S" first patient In city, man of
prominence and character.- who after (one)
treatment lost all symptoms of life-long,
most distressing disease, says: "Rexradlo
is a wonder. I believe he can do almost
anything but raise the dead." Interview
him. . ' ' .
"DEAF-MUTE." totally -deaf and dumb,
brought to Rexradio by his "physician" (lo-
cal prominent practitioner 30 years), who
witnessed treatment and results. Patient's
ears treated 3 seconds only, when he heard
and correctly, intelligibly spoke words and
sentences spoken to him while his eyes were
closed, so he could not see to read speaker's
lips. Doctor said: "Had I not seen this with
my own eyes I would have considered the
statement a hoax or fake, or the chimera
of a diseased brain." He can be seen (con-
fidentially) by persons interested in "deaf-
mutes."
"REXRADIO" offers to treat 100 "deaf-
mutes" (free); you know Â£ome; bring them.

unyielding log. After one treatment (in-
stantly) each Joint moved, she rose from
bed (unaided), and sat on chair. Her fin-
gers partially open were as if solid marble,
no force able to straighten or close them,
but instantly she straightened and largely
closed them, grasped a comb and combed
her hair, held pen, wrote her name, all be-
fore impossible. Her numerous friends are
amazed at the wondrous change. She now
sits up, has cooked meals, washed handker-
chiefs and been wheeled out to visit her
friends. Her arms and limbs are straight-
ening more continually. She Is the most
Joyful person In city. Persons Interested In
similar cases can visit her and see for them-

"REXRADIO" last week almost made my
"paralyzed" limb anew; foot dragged, could
raise It half Inch, couldn't put It forward;
after ten seconds' treatment foot ceased
dragging, raised it to table top, put It for-
ward naturally in walking and running,
leaped frtely from floor. Interview me at
offices. (Many similar cases.)
"REXRADIO" made my 24 years' deaf ear
hear In three seconds. A lady of noble Eng-
lish family had her finger, touched a . mo-
ment by Rexradlo, thus conveying tata .power
to it. Then she placed her finger *on my ear

"REXRADIO" promptly cured my large
"ulcer." After first treatment suppuration
quickly ceased, ulcer cleansed, quickly, be-
came covered with healthy skin. You can't

no relapse. Interview me.
"REXRADIO'S" two treatments In one dfcy
entirely cured my agonizing pneumonia. J
consider it almost a, miracle. Interview me
at offices.
"REXRADIO'S" one treatment removed every
symptom of my life-long, painful disease,
which often had made me'wleh for death.
I continued the treatments and after many
weeks am still well and hearty. (See me.)

considerable quantities of Western and do
mestic stock still unsold. A portion of the
receipts of Game came to hand tainted as a
result of the hot weather in the country, and
such stock had to be sold below the quota

The Lumber Trade.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says: "The
inenth of September, with all its holidays, was
better than the preceding thirty-one days.
Prices have been fairly well maintained in
pine circles, although there is a slight ten
dency to cut the price list figures. Deliveries
have been active, while orders have been nu
merous and large. Redwood is strong and
normal, with no seeaiing defire to cut prices.
Orders are large and plentiful. Redwood ehln
|rleÂ» are lively, with Eastern, Southern and
Middle Western demand* good. The local
redwood association is shaping it* destiny in
excellent form and entering territories where
there reemed to be no hope of creating a lucra
tive trade. Cedar shingles are ttrong in the
t-cuthern parts of California, and all in all the
Western lumber markets are improving far be
yond expectations. "

CHICAGO. Oct. 1. â Bullish European crop
advices caused a firm tone In the wheat mar
ket to-day, following a weak opening. At the
close December wheat was up }ic. May closed
precisely at yesterday's final figures. Corn and
oats ure up !ic and provisions 5c to 20c.
At the start, sentiment in the wh<at pit was
decld^Uly bearish, the principal depressing in
fluence being a bis increase in Northwestern
receipts. In addition to the liberal arrivals
cables furnished a further incentive to sellers,,
prices in the' foreign grain market failing to
lollow this advance made here. A large in
crease in Ftocks at Liverpool and larger ship
ments than expected from Australia were
causa of depression abroad.. The market here
opened with December down %t to. %c, at
SI 12H to $1 12Â»S; and May off He to >ic to
%@%c. at $1 13 to ?1 13>i. With pit traders
quite unanimously favoring the celling side,
prices soon dropped about \^c, December de
clining to $1 llTg. May sold off to $1 12%.
Buying by commission houses "rallied the mar
ket slightly and the trade temporarily settled
into a scalDlne affair, with fluctuations email.
Later in the day firmer feeling developed on a
report by a Chicago statistician confirming ad
vices Indicating a poor wheat crop In Portugal.
Another report which originated with a leading
cash train house on the continent stated that
the Russian wheat crop- this season Is 448,000.
000 \o 472,000,000 bushels, as against nearly
612,0<i0.0o0 bushels last year. The strength
of the Minnesota market was an added bull
factor late In the day. As the market started
upward local traders who sold short early be
came frightened and bought back their wheat.
Under this buying, December advanced to
$1 13% and May to $1 12%. The close was firm,
with December at (1 12Ti- May-'lClosed at
$1 13H@1 13',4.
Unfavorable weather condltlonsT'were main
factors' in causing a firm tone in the corn
market. Offerings were light and were used
mostly In filling scattered demands from shorts.
Country offerings were small. December closed
at 51(&ol%c. a gain of lc.
Oats were firm. December closed %c up at
30%c.
Provisions were strong, on a Â¦ good demand
and emaller offerings. Outsiders and shorts
were active buyers. Selling was scattered. At
the close, January pork wan up 20e; lard was

LOCAL MARKETS.
The fruit market was â¢active at the opening
under the usual extra local demand for Sun
day requirements, but after the wants of the
early trade had been filled there was quite a
surplus of stock on hand and late buyers were,
able to shade the quotation); for everything
but Apples and Pears. Some dealers were ex
pecting a higher range of prices for Bartlett
Pears and fancy Apples. Stock* of table
Grapes were "greatly increased by the arrival
of large consignments, which had been ren
dered unfit for shipment to Eastern markets
by the rains of last week. Dry lots cleaned
up well at good prices, while rain-damaged
offerings of all varieties were being pressed
for sale at 25@50e per box or crate. Receipts
of open boxes were light and prices were well
maintained. Wine Grapes, too. showed the ef
fects of the recent rains and met with very
*Iow sale at Irregular prices. Strawberries
and Raspberries were steady for good stock
and prices had a wide range as to quality.
Reeeipta came to hand very early yesterday
for the first time In about a week, i Another
car of Cape Cod Cranberries came in on Fri
day, making the fourth thus far for the sea
son. Prices are lower, as will be seen.
Peaches and Figs have shown much deteriora

has been lessened considerably, as dealers
refuse to buy any more than absolutely neces

Adolph Steffens, who was indicted by
the Grand Jury for illegally voting the
name, of C. C. Crew in the Seventy
third Precinct, is still at large, the ef
forts of the police for two days having
failed, they say, to obtain any trace of
him. Captain John B. Martih, before
relinquishing the position of Captain of
Detectives yesterday afternoon^ said
that he was certain Steffens was still
in. the city and was avoiding arrest
merely to give his friends time to pre
pare) the bail bond of $5000 that was
fixed by Judge Lawlor. ..
[ -Two detectives have been detailed to
find ' Steff ens; but they participated in
the parade of the Police Department
yesterday and in other ways showed
that they felt no anxiety as to the case
of the fireman under indictment. Noth
ing has been Jone at the Hall of Jus

that Steffens has fled the city.

The cross-examination of Edgar. S.
Wheelan, who saw- Charles, Wyman
forge the name of S.-H. Mann and cast
a fraudulent ballot, did not develop a
v.eak point in the boy's testimony. He
was on the stand all of yesterday aft

and did not deviate in one particular
from corroboration of the testimony, of
his father. Fairfax H. Wheelan/ who
Boy Is Alert Witness and
Wyraairs Lawyer Cannot
Find Flaw in Testimony
EDGAR WHEELAN
FIRM ON STAND
The witness described every Incident
as Wyman proceeded from the roster to
the ballot clerk, then to the booth, then
to the ballot box, where he announced
his name to be "Mann," and finally of
his prompt exit from the voting place.
The boy kept utterly free of entangle
ments in -his testimony, notwithstand
ing the keen efforts of counsel to shake
the forec of it. During the fire of cross
examination his memory was put to
the test many times as to what he had
already testified- to, but it' proved' very
clear and too alert for counsel to make
any headway against, him. .:-
The ' defendant, Wyman, appears un
perturbed; because of the accusation
against him and In 'agreeable mood he
sat through" Â» the afternoon, chewing
gum and frequently engaging in con
versation with Public Works Commis
sioner F. A. Maestrettl, who was beside
him most . of the. time. He remained
outside the courtroom until the bailiff
was sent for him, Attorney Countryman
having advised this manner of denying
Police Court J urisdiction while habeas
preferred the charge of illegal voting.
The attorney i for the defendant was
unable to pick a flaw in this part of the
case. of the prosecution. '
The hearing will " be resumed on
Wednesday at 11 o'clock, when the com
plainant will be called for cross-exam
ination.
Attorney Countryman protested
against proceeding with the examina
tion yesterday, his ground being that
the writ of habeas corpus granted by
Judge Sloss on Friday and made re
turnable to-morrow morning stayed the
hearing in the Police Court. He de
clared that to proceed would be con
temptuous of the order or. the Superior
Court. . A long discussion .followed, In
which Judge , Cabanias gave "it as his
opinion that it would be proper to go
forward with the examination. He de
ferred to the wishes of counsel for the
prosecution, however, and they decided
to go on after arriving at the conclu
sion that there could be no Invalida
tion of proceedings.

in a few minutes to' vote the second
time. The witness saw him go to the

him.
tions of Countryman said he went to
the polling place at Bush and Baker
streets, in the Seventy-third Precinct,
on the morning of the primary election
to distribute pasters of the Independent
Republican ticket, his father having so
requested him. He remained about the
booth all day, and was standing at the
door with his father when Wyman
came, shortly before 4 o'clock, to cast
his vote.
