ROSE HOLLSWORTH, a 1 6-year old servant girl, is in prison, accused of
having attempted to poison the family of Harold F. v Jackson, -at 2658
Market street, Thursday^ morning, by pouring carbolic acid into the bottles
of milk and cream. Two children partook of pancakes into which poisoned
milk had been mixed, but prompt use of antidotes saved their lives. The
servant had no reasonable motive and it is believed that her mind is unbalanced.

ROME, Oct. 28.â Prince Yonagchan
min, special Korean envoy accredited
to France, has arrived in Rome asVthe
bearer of a letter from Emperor Yi-
Heunjj to the Pope. He had an inter
view with Cardinal Merry, Del Val,
Secretary of State, yesterday, and was
received in audience to-day.
The letter requests the Pope to inter

powers, in j the protection of the integ
rity of â¢ Korea at the ] conclusion of the

"The ; other " little girl, ' Catherine

"Mrs. . Jackson accuses me of this
awful thing and I won't stand It," said
the girl in indignation. A moment later
there was a humorous remark and her
pretty brown eyes were instantly alight
with innocent laughter arid dimples
played merrily.
"Some" one must have placed the car
bolic acid in the milk and cream â¢while
It was standing on the doorstep in the
morning, for I found the tops [ re
moved." ehe continued. "Mr*. Jackson
herself cooked the pancakes, while! I
tended her baby. Her nine-year-old
daughter. Hlldagard. complained that
the. cakes were green and the mother
told her she was becoming too" critical
about her food. Hildagard then re
marked that Ehe detected the odor of
carbolic. acid, but she ate four of the
pancakes after her mother speke'to her
sharply.'
IS SEST FOR ' ANTIDOTE.
The perverted mind of a childâ a six
teen-year-old servant girl, whose name
Is Rose liollsworth â conceived a crude
plot to poison the family of Harold F.
Jackson at 2C58 Market street at break
fast Thursday morning, but two little
girls who first partook of the pancakes
In which carbolic acid had been mixed
were at once given antidotes and no
harm was done.
Last night the accused child sat on
a bench in the City Prison with twitch-
Ing brow and stoutly and steadfastly
denied the charge of attempted mur
der. She was ready with answers, but
her stories lacked plausibility. The
police are convinced that ehe is de
ranged and she is tcf be examined by
the Lunacy Commission to-day.
"Why Bhould I want to kill the fam
ily, why should I want to put those
dear little girls to death?" asked the
young prisoner. There was no answer.
Indeed, a motive for her strange act is
what the police have searched for In
vain.

Aflfoir of Trawlers
to Be Settled by
Commission.
"Now that the Supreme Court has
ruled that the Mayor has no veto au
thority on proposed amendments, but
that they could , not go on the ballot
for, the coming election, we" thought thÂ«
way was clear to have a special elec
tion on all the twenty- two amend
ments.' The Mayor could not exercise
any authority In "opposition, ' the Su
preme Court had assured us.
"But if the Election Board cannot
supply the funds that settles the whole
matter. I suppose. It would be utterly
impossible; for the ; Supervisors to use
any money L which* has been set aside
for; other purposes. ' As to our emer
gency fund of $36.000, 1, will say that it
will be impossible. to use a cent of It
for s an ; election. The whole fund is
about: spoken, for. already."
Registrar Adams was equally posi?
tive that there would be no money
available in the elections department.
AH, the. money allowed it in the budget
will be needed for, the regular expenses.
The next budget must now.be await
ed .and the contemplated special elec
tion postponed until after July 1, 1903.
The matter of policy, must also be
considered and It is not unlikely that
there will be no voting on the amend
ments till the general election In No
vember of next year.
True, as President Roncovierl of the
Board v of Education, who urgently
wants to have the provisions as to the
schools amended, pointed out to the
Supervisors yesterday, the law is man
datory on them to call a special elec
tion when the petitions . are filed. But
Roncovlert did not vouchsafe any In
formation as to how a special election,
costing $12,000, can be held when the
treasury is bare of an overplus.
""We were awaiting the decision of
the Supreme Court with the intention
of giving the matter of calling a special
election serious attention after the tri
bunal should "have laid down the law
to us hTthe Harrison suit," said Super
visor D'Ancona, "and It was our idea,
of course, that the Election Commis
sioners had money on hand with which
to pay the cost "of the election. The
most serious question to us was wheth
er or not it was good policy to hold a
special election. There was good argu
ment that the proposed amendments
could wait until- the next* general
election.
THOUGHT COURT CLEARED WAY.
The movement toward hastening the
changes in the city's organic law has
been taking deep root, and the Super
visors have been seriously considering
the matter of calling a special election.
There was keen disappointment in some
quarters because the twenty-two
amendments could not be submitted to
the voters at the coming election and
some have urged that the expense of a
special election was regarded as justifi
able.
Now comes the Election Board with
the positive assurance that it has not a
cent to spare. The funds set aside by
the Supervisors in the budget for the
department will all be needed for the
regular elections.
The Commissioners suggest that the
Supervisors may use their emergency
fund, the total of which was $36,000, if
'they. are, bent on having a. special elec
tfonv- But "there are already more de
mands on that precious little fund than
can be met, declare the Supervisors.
In undignified parlance of the City
Hall, the Board of Supervisors and the
Board of Election Commissioners have
been "passing the buck" to each other
Â£h'e past few days. The matter has en
gaged their attention earnestly, and the
outcome resolves itself into the steru
fact that there can be no election be
cause of lack of money to pay the cost.
MUST AWAIT NEXT BUDGET.
There win be no special election
daring the present fiscal year on the
proposed amendments to the charter.
It would cost about $12,000 to hold
such an election and nowhere In the
financial system of the municipality

BUTTE, Oct. 28.â In a signed
statement to the public F. Au
gustus Heinze denies having
. turned over . his ' interests ' to
Amalgamated Copper and, replying to
Thomas W.( Lawson's statement and
offer/ to : distribute $1,000,000 among the
Butte | miners if Heinze can disprove
the statement, offers to wager $250,000
with Lawson that he can show con
trolling, interest in the United Copper
Company. Heinze's statement is as
follows: . . â¢ V . ~
"I am too 'busy a man to be called
upon to answer such wild statements
as these , emanating from Mr. Thon" As
"W. Lawson of Boston and men of /his
class, butl am still "ready to prove my
sincerity to the people of Montana and
to do so I am ready to \ ignore the
source from which such statements Is
sue, and in reply to Mr. . Lawson's as
sertion that I,- have lost control of* my
mining properties in . Butte, I hereby
offer' the following . proposition to Mr.
Lawson: ; -
"I will post a forfeit of $250,000 in any
reputable, bank in Butte City, to be
used to build and maintain In . the
State of ; Montana a" home ~,,l or indigent
and disabled union'men if I do not pro
duce in the city of Butte, before a com
mittee composed of five gentlemen, one
each appointed- by r the Miners' Union,
the'Mlll arid' Smelter Men's Union, the
Stationary. .Engineers'. Union,- the
American Federation of Labor and the
American Labor Union, proof of my
control of the ! stock of the UnltedCop
per Company, provided Mr. Thomas
W. Lawson of Boston posts a like sum
in the same place, binding himself to
forfeit the" same, to be used 'for the
purpose named. If I do not produce the
stock -hereinbefore referred to."
Tnorrias W. Lawson to-night makes a
rejoinder- to Heinze's offer to wager
$250,000. He refuses to "go up against"
what he declares is a scheme on the
part of Heinze and Amalgamated Cop
per Interests to deliberately bunko him
out of $250,000 through enabling Heinze
to borrow for the time being enough
United Copper certificates to show con
trol. Â¦-Â¦â¢Â¦.. -
Heiijze is branded as a "cheap chap,"
with whose . nefarious work * Lawson
says he will take no chances. He re

prove any of his assertions. -

abAtthe commerce of this country, because
I:know It will Interest you. The United States
exports, more goods to foreign lands than any
other country on the globe, yet tht fact stands
that less than nine per cent of' these goods Is
carried away. from our ports In American ships.
This Â¦ Is a deplorable fact and the Republican
party purposes remedying It. Prior to I860
our. ships carried a majority' of . the cargoes of
the : world, . but they dwindled away until Â¦ now
we arc paying foreign nations millions of dol
lars , every â¢ year to carry our exports â¢ to the

ever comes back to the United States, and we
are going to reverse this condition. " Â¦:
There is a. strong plank in the Republican
platform for the upbuilding of , the American
merchant marine.' and one that will bring mil
lions . of -dollars annually . to American â¢ ship
owners. When Congress reconvenes, the com
mission appointed by it to devise a way to
unbuild the American- merchant marine .will
report, and a bill will be. drafted. This will
mean a great era of prosperity to the cities of

at Pioneer Hall last evening. Frank
P. Flint of Los Angeles, candidate for
United States Senator, was the prin
cipal speaker of the evening, and his
frank, earnest style raised the enthu
siasm of the audience to a high pitch.
Joseph Goddard, to whom campaign
ing is an old story, was the chairman
of the evening and he handled" the
crowd with skill. Mr. Flint was the
first speaker introduced and the cheers
of the audience demonstrated his popu
larity. After thanking the audience for
the flattering reception accorded him,
Mr. Flint said: ' -\ \ "
I am not 'going' to wait until I am about to
conclude my speech before calling your at
tention to the necessity of electing the Re
publican legislative candidates In this district,
but by way of Introduction I am going to ask
you to support and to vote for Prank- A.

the Assembly: â¢ The â¢ next Legislature will be
called upon to lend Its aid in- carrying out
the . policies 'of the great Republican party,

power. - 1 know your candidates and know that
they are true Republicans and can be depended
upon ln every emergency. These men' are en
titled to your support and I know they' will
receive it. '. - > , .
Now. as to the Issues of the national : com
paÂ»fen: Imperialism, Â¦ so called, our friends the
Democrats -seem to have singled out as the
lone Issue B'orthy , of the name. Imperialism
moans empire. Our- beloved McKlnley, they
said, â¢ favored Imperialism, but not even they
dared to put the true Interpretation on the
term, and accuse him of ' seeking an em
peror's crown. Nor had , they the less right
to say it of-McKinley than they have to say
it' of Roosevelt, for ln his- every, political act
he has been .Republican and American.
FALSE INTIMATION.
Empires are maintained by the mailed fist,
and who can say that our army, I made up of
your boy and mine, would lend Itself to the
maintenance of an empire.' When the Demo
crats make, this intimation they know they
make false intimation, and it is only political
extremity that drives them to such deeds.
Now, â¢ Â«is' to the trusts:' The Republican
party, is "doing more ; to-day to Â¦ regulate- the
trusts .than was ever. done In the history of
the Government: Â¦ Measures to regulate the
trusts were in - force during. Cleveland's . ad

nothing. The Â¦ election of, William McKlnley.
however, put . these /laws Into operation, and
steadily the work goer on to crush out organi

Parker, the Democratic standard bearer, 'has
said that -the; laws: now on the -books. and .the
common law are sufficient to stamp out every

hereto, which I have the honor to request may
be given .promptly.
"Hoping to know you personally In a short
time and to Doable to dt> you official favors."
This report -was a grossly improper one for
a man- in your position to make of a post
master and your letter certainly Implies that
favors may be given or withheld In thÂ« discre
tion of the man making the request.
The postmaster at Portage, accord-
Ing to Secretary Loeb's letter, declined
to make the arrangement proposed
and Miss Tyner was transferred to
Chicago and the position she held'at
Portage abolished and no appointment
to the vacancy made. The letter con
tinues: â¢ . .
It appears clear that you were keeping your
daughter In the postal service simply for the
sake of Riving her the salary, and that when
she did not occupy the position It was not
deemed necessary to fill it at all; and you
actually called the attention of the postmaster
at Portage to this* fact in order to Induce him
to retain your daughter, pointing out to him
that, as actually happened, he . would . lose
the appropriation for the position . unless he
acted as you desired.
On April 8 of the same year you wrote to
the postmaster at Ware, Mass.. requesting
that he appoint one Cora Watson as a cleric
in his office on condition that he was pro
vided with an allowance to pay her salary.
In this letter you, the law official of the Post
office Department, deliberately Instructed the
postmaster to violate the, law by appointing
Cora Watson in the Ware potstofflce, where
her services were not needed. The furtlveness
of your action ' 1? shown by this statement
in your letter to the postmaster:.
"You can do as you wish about giving out
the Impression that she Is there as a repre
sentative of the postoffice to assist In the es
tablishment of free delivery. It is only frank,
however, to say that she 1* not a postofnee
expert."
It was not a.bona fide appointment, but one
designed Improperly to get Miss Watson In
the classified service. . When the Postmaster
objected ynu assumed an offended tone in your
letter to him of April 14, asking him why h?
wished so much "ceremony" and why be was
"timid" in the matter, assuring him that the
appointment was proper and correct and war
ranted by law, because you were the law* ad
viser not only of the Postoffice Department,
but of the entire Postal Service. -and yet you
could not possibly have been Ignorant that the
transaction was an illegal one. Â¦
For the reasons ..above set -forth, the-Presi
dent regrets to hare to state to you that he
cannct comply with yoor' request. The ques
tion of your guiU on the criminal charge, on
which you were tried having been passed upon
by a Jury, the President: of course, acquiesces
tn Its findings; but the evidence seems to him
overwhelming that you were guilty either, of
moral ' obliquity ln Â¦> the ' performance of your
duty, or of the grossest - Inefficiency. * Very
truly yours. . WILLIAM LOEB JR.,

CANDIDATE FOR U. S. SENATE
WHO ADDRESSED REPUBLIC
ANS LAST NIGHT. â¢
The Republican rally at the Potrero
Opera-house drew a big crowd last
night. The speechmaking began early
and lasted late. The crowd in attend
ance was good-natured and warmly ap
plauded the different points in the
speeches that pleased them, especially
those relative to the exclusion of Chi
nese and Japanese from this country.
T. C." Duff acted as chairman. :
Julius Kahn spoke in his usual bril
liant and happy vein. His speech urged
devotion to the Republican party and
adherence to its principles, which prin
ciples are fair not only to the moneyed
man, but to the laborer. The' country
had prospered under the administration
of ReDublicansrrand it was going ahead
at a marvelqus r ratq. It .would continue
to do so under the same policy. <
E. A.- Hayes of the Fifth Congres
sional District said in part: ,
I will,lend my support to any- act for the
exclusion of Chinese and Japanese, from the
United States If -I am . Â»ent :to Congress.
We. do not want a - race here that refuses to
adopt our customs. They are' a menace to
the laboring man.. The money they accumu
late does not stay here. â¢They, lower the
standard of wages and, .thereby deprive Amer
ican ' families of the necessities which accrue
from fair remuneration for their labors. ! All
of you 1 are familiar with the dangers; that
face you If this class ef people continue to
Invade our land. There Is one way to â¢ put
a stop to It and that is at the polls.
Senator R. J. Welch. delivered a force
ful speech. He aaid in part: "If I am
elected J would exact a promise from
any man who might be a candidate for
United States Senator that he would
vote for the.exclusion of the Japanese
from this country.',' ;
Charles M. Shortridga, was greeted
with a big. burst of applause when he
stepped on the platform. .He gave what
might be called a regular "heart to
heart" talk to his hearers. He took
them Int$ his confidence at the start
and held them until the close of his
remarks. . The gist of his speech was
that he was an American and a Repub
lican and Mould stand for Republican
principle's from beginning to. end. He
said many salient and humorous things
in the course of his speech. â¢
..Jeremiah Lucey made a few remarks
pertinent to the occasion. ,â¢ :
is well known, he did not go Into de
tails, simply reiterating his sympathy
with the workingmen and his consistent
and continuous effort to raise the
standard of their living. ThiB, as he
understands it, can be accomplished
by the employment of American labor
alone, the purchase of American pro
ducts, the shortening of the hours of
labor and the raising of wages. The
speaker further explained that no Ori
ental had ever been employed by him;
no imported articles the like of which
American labor produces were, ever
purchased by him; he had lately re
duced the legal day's work fronvejght
to seven and a half hours. Twice with
out solicitation on the part of the print
ers of the Mercury and Herald of San
Jose he had raised their wages. :
Branching away from these subjects,
he stated that if . elected to. Congress
he would advance the interests of the
shipbuilders of- this coast. by advocat
ing the placing of contracts for the |
building of warships in their hands.
He further stated that he favored the
reinforcement of our navy, the en
largement of foreign markets for our
surplus products and the Increased em
ployment of American workingmen In
all branches of labor. "One of my du
ties in Congress." said the speaker,
"will be to enact legislation to secure
restoration of our merchant marine by
the payment of subsidies to American
built mail carriers and freighters, suf
ficient to enable them to compete suc
cessfully with the ships of foreign
countries."
Cheers greeted these remarks, clearly
demonstrating that his declarations
were accepted as sincere, and those
wage workers before him within hid
district were, for the speaker's election
to Congress.
James Spear, the manager of the
works, made a tour of the-yards and
Introduced Mr. Hayes to the employes
of the several departments.
PROMPT DEXLAJU
The charge that E. A. Hayes. Repub
lican nominee for Congress, Fifth Dis
trict, is an employer <jf Chinese is
promptly refuted by the following
signed statement, reinforced by affi
davits:
Reference having been made to Chinese
having been employed on -our place at Kd"n
Vale. I wish to state that, my brother. E. A.
Hayes, has never ln any way. directly or In-,
directly, employed any Chinese there. That 1
may not give any false color to the facts ln
making this statement, I wish to state that
soon atter we came to California to live per
manently I made a contract with. Mr. Ulrich,
then bead gardener at the Hotel del Monte.
to survey the erounds around our house make
walks, drives. . flower beds, -etc.. and plant
some trees and shrubbery. Soon alter he
started the work under this contract he brought
some Chinese there, against my protest, to do
certain of the work that he* claimed he could
not do without them'. . "While" there' they' lived
on a remote corner of the ranch,' boarded them
selves and in no manner lived with or near
the other men on the ranch, and left as soon
as the special work Mr. UlrlcfT wished them to
do was -completed.- When I - made this con
tract with Mr. Ulrica my brother, was ln
the East, was there during all the time they
were there and did not return to California
until five months after they had left. He had '
nothing to do with -either the contract or. tht- [
work, and knew nothing about the matter until
long afterward.: - - â¢â¢'.- â¢ Â¦ .- Â¦-â¢Â¦:Â¦:.Â¦Â¦.',
With the exception of. these -men whir* were
working for Mr. Ulrich no Chinese or Japanese
have ever worked ln our garden or orchards, or
on our ranch. J. O. HAYES..

BIG RALLY
OF VOTERS
AT POTRERO
WASHINGTON,. Oct. 28.â By direction
of the President, Secretary Loeb to-day
sent to James N. Tyner, the former As
sistant Attorney General for the Post
office Department, a letter In reply to
Tyner's letter dated October 8 and made
public last night. The letter says that
the question of Tyner's guilt on the
criminal charge on -which he was tried
has been passed upon by a jury and
the President acquiesces in the Jury's
finding, but the evidence ''seems to him
overwhelming that you (Tyner), were
guilty either of moral obliquity in per
formance of duty or of the grossest in
efficiency." The letter follows:
Whito House. Washington, Oct. 23, 1901.
Sir â The President has received this morn
ing your letter dated October 8. written ln
answer to my letter of June 24. which I have
never made public, although you did make
public your own letter which It answered. In
your present letter you again claim that a
wrong hus been. done you, and ask that it be
righted. As you are out of office the righting
of the wrong could only be effected by your
reinstatement to office, or a declaration by the
President that you were Innocent. The Presi
dent instructs me to say to you that his
memorandum to which you take exception was
written -when three indictments against you
had been returned by the Grand Jury, the
report of Mr. Brlstow having been submitted
to Messrs. Bonaparte and Conrad, and' the
action taken against you by the Department of
Justice bfing on tho recommendtlon of Messrs.
B'.napartc and Conrad. In his memorandum
the President referred to your office as follows:
. -The Investigation discloses a condition of
gross corruption In the office of the Assistant
-Attorney General for, the Postoffice Depart
ment. In the case of Assistant Attorney Gen
eral .-Tyner I (the misconduct) has gone on for
a number of years, bnt.lt Is Impossible to say
exactly when It began. â¢â¢? â¢ â¢ The three
chief offenders In the Government service- were
Tyntr, Machen ana Beavers. . Friends of Tyner
hnive - advanced the theory that in his case the
chief offender was really â¢ his nephew by mar
riage. Barrett, who was bis assistant ln office
for a part of (he term, and that Tyner's of
fenses were due to his falling bodily and mental
powers. The facts set forth ln Mr. Brlatow's
report do not tend to substantiate the validity
of these excuses for Tyner. while they show
literally astounding misconduct tn Barrett.
â¢ â¢ â¢ . In the office of the Assistant At
torney General for the Po3torfice Department,
under Tyner and Barrett, far greater wrong
was inflicted upon, the public than could be
measured by a pecuniary standard, for in, this
office the corruption of the Government offi
cials took the form of favoring get-rich-quick
concerns and similar swindling schemes; ln
other words, -the criminals, whom it was the
sworn duty of there Government officials to
pro.Â«< !cutÂ», raid them for permission to fleece
the: public unmolested.
"Of the criminal charges on which you were
tried you have been declared Innocent by a
Jury In a court of law; the "verdict Is final
ho regards all citizens. Including the President.
There Is. however, a wide difference between
misconduct which : 'la criminal and declared
such by the courts and. misconduct which,
though It does not render the wrongdoer liable
to the criminal law, | yet requires his lm
, mediate separation . from ; the Government ser
vice and justifies his severe condemnation by
the general community on " moral Â¦ grounds.
-You were acquitted of. conspiring with liar
re tt to do certain criminal deeds. . You were
not acquitted of doing the deeds.
"That these get-rich-qulck. concerns which
employed Mr. Barrett were Improperly favored
In your office seems "to admit of no doubt.
In the case of the Arnold turf concern, where
Mr." Barrett received $6000, a committee of
th<> Missouri Senate which Investigated the
matter in March, 1903, reported as follows,'
after commenting upon a report of the post
office Inspector adverse ta the . concern in
question: -
That the ruling of the department was
not. in accordance - with-, his recommendation,
that from the evidence it appears that the
department at Washington, by -some process
or other, unknown to your committee. over
ruled the recommendation of the Inspector,
dlsmlDsed the cases pending against these Com
panies and ,they were allowed to Â¦ proceed with
their 'process of absorbing the people's money.
Had the department at Washington acted
promptly and 'properly upon the recommenda
tion, of the Inspector millions of dollars would
have : been saved the people of the State of
Missouri and other States. -
.. Secretary Loeb's letter recites the
connection of Barrett, Tyner's nephew,
Â¦ with the â¢; revocation Â¦ of fraud orders
and declares that , the record war
rants the statement that "your (Ty
ner's) removal was imperatively de
manded in ..the interest of honest and
efficient government." The letter con
tinues:' . - % - m v. â¢-. â¢
, There are certain" matters which could not
come i before the Jury which nevertheless . it
was* and is necessary for the President to
consider - when you â¢ request him to take' any
action looking Â¦: to the rehabilitation - of your
character. One of these is the burglary ' com
mitted by Mrs. Barrett, 'Mr. .Barrett's mother,'
and by Mns^.'Tyner af your direction. Mrs.
Ty ner came to the Postoffice .Department, - en
tered : your private room In the office and then
admitted Mrs.*- Barrett and a ' safe ' expert | and
the.. three then , rifled the safe. . Â¦ TheH>epart
.merit of Justice has never , been able to know
exactly "what documents were' at that time
abstracted from Â¦ the safe.' Â¦ Â« The . President ' has
the right to assume that they, would not have
been abstracted in â¢ this manner had ' they , not
been of : a :â¢, character - rachva*;. would gravely
incriminate you. and Mr. Barrett. As regards
this and all of the other actions the President
was at' fine time inclined to excuse' you on
the ground of. your -failing- powers, but as
you common cause -with Mr. Barrett
mit- was difficult . to see how ' this excuse . could
be put v *orward.-- Moreover. ; oertain other ae
tlons of yours were ' brought to the President' s
attention which seemed to show such gross
lack of : the sense of official propriety on your
part as not to warrant film In making; a pre
sumption â¢ In your favor. â¢:â¢ For - Instance, on
March 29. 1902. you;, writing on the paper' of

SIXTH DISTRICT,
SECOND DISTRICT.
Intelligence from the Sixth Congres
sional District is gratifying 'to the Re
publican State Central Committee. J.
C. Needham,* nominee of the party for
a fourth term in Congress, is conduct
ins: a winning campaign. He is greeted
by vast throngs of people, who cheer
him for the good work he has done in
the halls of the national legislature.
The opponents of Needham are resort
ing to the despicable course of circulat
ing unsigned dodgers in which the rec
ord in Congress 'of the able representa
tive is misquoted.
Henry W. Lynch, the Republican
candidate for the Legislature, Thirty
fiist .Senatorial District, is making a
pallant right for election, and impartial
reports from the counties of Monterey,
San Henito and San Luis Obispo sig
nify that he will carry the district.
Lynch has a host of warm personal
friends, and they are enthulastic in his
suppsrt. knowing that his election
would reflect honor on the counties
named.
The State Central Committee is ad
vised that Duncan E. McKinlay will
â¢win out handsomely in the Second. To
night at Willows the able and eloquent
champion will address the voters of
Glenn County. Reports come from the
upper Sacramento to the effect that
Hell is explaining and explaining. Tlfe
committee had a 'stenographer take
down his speech at Colusa and these
utterances of the Congressman will be
read at the Veterans' Home:
'â¢Let us get rid of the Philippine Isl
and*. They are a burden to the Amer
ican people. It requires great sums of
the people's money to protect them and
to maintain our civil and military
governments there."
There is an active "patriotic sentiment
up in Napa County in favor of keeping
the flag where the valor of American
volunteers placed it and perhaps there
i3 a strong feeling the other way up in
the Democratic stronghold of Colusa.
A Democratic nominee for /Congress
surely finds the situation quite embar
rassing, especially when a stenogra
pher is present.
Jud C. Brusle is scheduled to' preach
the Republican gospel in Colusa. He
will tell the people the truth regarding
appropriations for the Sacramento
River. The State committee is ready
to submit j the record. What Bell
claimed in his Colusa speech was
taken down word for word.
Duncan E. McKinlay" will speak at
Sterling the evening of November 2.

anda. Judge Parker said:
No more, satisfactory evidence of the wlde

the force of the statement of this co fnâ¢Â°^
accepted fact could be parried. The outcome
was an interview by Senator Knox. Care was
taken to preface the interview with the state
ment that It met the approval of the Presi
dent. It may be treated, therefore as an
administrative statement l Though there are
many of them these days two or three of
them I shall make reference to to-day.^
In passing It should be said that *Â«*lÂ°r
Knox on this occasionâ *s on othersâ referred
to the fact that I am of the OPM"*-"*
have said Â»o-that existing law affords an
adequate remedy against Illegal combination..
He says the law is insufficient and argues
that therefore. I am not in favor of break
ing up illegal combinations. .

THE GREAT QUESTION.
Now this long statement of Senator Knox
had nothing whatever to do with the question
uppermost in the public mind.
Shall the creations of Government, many or
which pursue illegal methods, control our
elections? Control them by moneys belonging
to their atockholdersâ moneys not Â«â¢ e Â° ln
the open and charged upon the hjoki "
moneys paid for*polltlcal purposes, but hidden
away by false bookkeeping?
Senator Knox has been at some pains
hitherto to prove that with all his learning
he does not know all about the common law.
It hardly seems possible, however, that he does
not know the rule that allegation* of the com
plaint not denied by the answer are thereby
admitted. He does not denyâ nor could be
that these contributions were made. If be

HIS POSITION
ttons, Is evidenced In the part by Ota great
activity of their leading: officers la favor of
the election of. my opponent. That activity
may perhaps account in no small measure for
the ability of both the Populist and Socialist
parties to prosecute expensive campaignsâ
campagins that appear to be proeeouted laxgelj
In aid of the -Republican party. The adminis
tration also puts out a cablegram from Gov
ernor .Wright of the Philippine Commission In
reply to some quotations made by me la a
speech delivered on the 15th day of October.
The words, quoted were the careful utterances
of - a man who has spent four months la the
Philippines studying the conditions there. . He
Is vouched for by Charles , Francis Adams..
Carl Schurz. Edwin' Burrltt Smith. Herbert
Welch and Moore Field Story In these words:
TRIBUTE TO WRIGHT.
Be has had exceptional opportunities for
learning the truth. For his entire honesty,
his skill as a trained Investigator, his Judg
ment In weighing evidence and bis reliability
as a witness, we. vouch.
The evidence upon which his conclusions
were based will be found, I am Informed, la
the Evening Post of to-day and probably in
other papers.
The article Is too long to be quoted from la
this brief address, but I ask with, and through
you, the American people, to examine Governor
Wright's cablegram In connection with that
report and then answer these questions :
"Do you believe the man thus vouched for
by six of the best citizens In this country?
Which la likely to bÂ« prejudiced, th* man hav
ing no motive but to learn the truth, or the
Governor who may be In some measure re
eponaible for the unfortunate conditions?
"Is the Governor's report of such a char
acter as to justify an expenditure of the Gov
ernment of several hundred dollar* to cable
a part of my speech to Manila and to receive
his reply by cable? It was not Government
business. It was political business. The. cable
gram to Governor Wright and hi* reply were
intended to aid the Republican campaign The
message to him began:
"The Democratic candidate for President
on the 15th of the present month In a public
address' said:" ...... - ....
If a few hundred dollars may be taken out
from tho public funds to thus assist the* pros
ecution of a political campaign, why may not
the money from the treasury be employed for
any purpose that will help the campaign? How
do we know but it is? This is one of the evi
dences of the growth of Imperialism..
ThÂ« head of the Government "can do no
wrong." An assault upon bis policy is an as
sault npon the people, and hence the people's
money can be legitimately used for his vindi
cation.
TAYLOR'S CRITICISM.
Judge Parker read from a newspaper
clipping an interview with Acting Sec
retary of the Treasury Horace A. Tay
lor, In which that official criticized
Judge Parker's speech charging official
extravagances. The speaker com
mented:
Now you will observe that he nowhere chal
lenges the figures given by me. They cannot
bo Quoted. They show that after taking . the
$50.u<)0,<>00 paid for the Panama canal and
rights this Government spent jltJo.ouo.iiw
more last year than it did sever years ago
under a Democratic administration. Â¦
' Nor does Mr. Taylor deny that thtÂ» expenses
excelled the r-Joelsts last year by orer $4O.
000.000. Nor does he deny that for the first
sixty days of this year the expanses exceeded
the receipts by t24.000.00O. In this connection
I call your attention to the fact that the ex
penditures so far this year are greater than
they were a year ago for the same period.
Since June 30 there has been spent 319S.681,
077. During a like period last year there was
Spent f 179. 168,097. We have an increase,
therefore, this year of over $19,000,000 la less
than a third of a year. And our expenses last
year were the greatest In our history. Ona
other fact should be noted. The deficit for the
present year. October 25, Is over S31.000.00U.
as against $1,141,204 for identically the same
period last year.
Judge Parker read orders issued by
department officials in Washington to
prove his assertion, denied by Taylor,
that were administrative tenders for
bidding Government officials from mak
ing public any statements of estimates
upon which future appropriations are
based. -
TAKES UP TARIFF.
The speaker then took up the tariff,
dwelling: upon the burdens of the farm
ers.
Judge Parker told of the combina
tions of the manufacturers, whose ob
jest was "to make the farmer, laborer
and business man continue to pay the
high prices which the tariff duties made
possible in this country without com
petition." He continued:
These combinations are trying* to give suc
cess to the Republican party because that
party and Its President have notified the
country that they stand pat. aa they call it.
on the tariff, which means that tbpy will not
interfere with it. Now the building up of
these combination*, usually called trusts, was
promoted by excessive tariff duties, but, it had
been extended far beyond the plans of ' the
originators. That the operation of most of
them hare proven harmful to the general pub
lic ;ccd cannot be qnestloned.
> Judge Parker described the oppres
sion of the stock raiser.' the retailer and
the consumer by the beef trust and con
tinued :
I select the meat trust, not because It ex
acts greater tribute than do ether trusts, but
aa an Illustration with which those of yon
who are farmers are perfectly familiar. There
are a great many others operating â¢ on similar
principles and their effect . has - been to in
crease the coÂ«t of Ilvinpr tn every direction
and also to deprive those who engage tn busi
ness of that equal opportunity which was- once
the glory and pride of. this country; The
small dealer and the small manufacturer are
belnu driven out of business. In a short time
only those . with large capital or those in
alliance with the combinations can success
fully engage in business or manufacturing.
If you are satisfied with the present con
ditions you should vote the Republican ticket,
for that party favors the stand-pat policy.
But If you are opposed to that policy, if you
believe In equal opportunity for all and special
privilege for none, you should both vote and
work for the election of the Democratic ticket.

Russian Government Believes Port

ST. PETERSBURG, OcL 29, 2:35
a rn. â Alarmist reports from foreign
sources of the alleged situation of the
Port Arthur garrison and of a renewal
of the Japanese attack ori~that strong
hold have created considerable popu
lar anxiety over the fate of the fort
ress, which, It must be confessed, had
almost been overlooked by the public
the last few days owing to the absorb
ing interest taken in the Xorth Sea
complications.
The Government simply saj*s it is
without direct advices, though it real
izes that the situation in the fortress
must be growing daily more difficult.
However, it maintains the firm belief
that the garrison will be able to hold
out.
The statement that General Stoessel
Is scorning all mention of surrender Is
described to be exactly what might be
expected. He is described as a man
who will fight as long as there Is a
finger In Port Arthur to pull a trigger.

ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 28; mid
nightâThere was a feeling of profound
relief to-night inVhigh Government
spheres and .diplomatic circles,, where
the knowledge existed that the grave
crisis in the relations between Russia
and Great Britain over the North Sea
incident^ had happily been averted by
a decision to submit the issue to a
commission to be created under the ar
ticles of The Hague convention.
This outcome will insure a definite
establishment of the facts and place
the responsibility and is attributed in
diplomatic circles mainly to the direct
interposition of Emperor Nicholas and
King Edward. The British, Govern
ment, In face of an excited public opin
ion, - which was demanding the " most
extreme measures, ~\ proposed the sub
mission of the issue to a commission
under The Hague convention, while the
Russian Government was preparing a
similar proposal to Great Britain. Neu
tral powers, notably France and, it is
believed, the United States, were using
all their influence to avert a world
catastrophe.
Definite assurance of a settlement
came this afternoon, when the -Czar, at
an audience with Foreign Minister
Lamsdorff, announced his complete and
hearty approval of the plan for - ah in

orders had already been sent to Vigo
to detain- the ships which \ participated

j Journalistic Views on Settlement Are
j Not at All Unanimous.
LONDON, Oct. 28. â The Daily Ex
press asserts that Admiral Sir Cyp
rien Bridge will be one of the Brit
ish representatives on-the commission
to inquire into the North Sea affair
which Premire Balfour has announced
and which, the Express adds, will sit
at Vigo under neutral chairmanship.
The Russian ships will anchor off
Vigo and Admiral Beresford has been
ordered to station the channel squad
ron there during the sittings of the
commission. The opinions of the
press on the settlement, as stated b'y
Balfour. are by no means unanimous.
The opposition journals welcome it as
a great victory for the principles of
conciliation and arbitration and all
express the belief that .the danger of
war has been avoided; but regarding
the manner of arriving at an agree
ment ideas greatly differ.
The pally Mall hails it in the big
gest type as "Russia's" Surrender.'
The more thoughtful papers and those
devoted to the Government interests
are much less pleased. The Standard
declares that Balfour's statement will
be received by the majority of Eng
lishmen with a sense of profound dis
appointment
"Russia," the Standard says, "has
given way a little, but we have given
way more."
Other Conservative papers similarly
complain that Great Britain is now de
barred from all action, apparently
without any guarantees as to what
portion of the second Pacific fleet will
be allowed to continue its journey and
with only Russia's promise of protec
tion against such incidents as the
North Sea affair.
Much criticism is bestowed upon
what is regarded as the unnecessary
eulogies the Premier paid to Emperor
Nicholas and his Government, and the
fact that Balfour ridiculed and de
claimed against the Russian admiral,
whosÂ» conduct he has consented to
refer to an international tribunal.
The Dally Telegraph dwells with
gratitude on the judicious and honor
able part which It believes M. Delcasse,
the French Foreign Minister, and Em
bassador Cambon played in "this most
welcome settlement."

man named P. A. Collins, whose home

at an early hour this morning and it
is generally believed that he commit

girl's cape wet with acid, and her
handkerchief was soaking with it.
Hildagard 'says she saw Rose go after
the bottles and hbld^ Them under her
jacket while standing : at the doorstep.
It "is ''-supposed that at this time she
poured the poison into the milk and
cream and accidentally spilled acid
on the cape," which she was wearing.
She 'probably used the handkerchief in

Last Saturday the house was robtted,
a cape, a silk dress and a bicycle being
stolen. Mrs. Jackson's jewelry was
also missing, but Rose produced this,
giving the explanation that she had
hidden it for safekeeping. Suspicions
were entertained against the girl, but
nothing was said to her of them. De
tective Fitzgerald was .called, and,
after investigation, he bluntly told her
to bring back the stolen articles.
Monday afternoon she took Hilda
gard with her to Ingleside and they re
turned with the dress and cape. On
Sunday Rose had taken a car ride and
had seen a woman, she said, wearing
the stolen clothes and traveling in the
direction of Ingleside. This gave her
a clew, and in searching among some
trees she and Hildagard came across
the bundle containing the cape and
the gown. It iÂ» believed that Rose had
hidden them there herself.
-But the girl was so helpful about the
house that Mrs. Jackson did not wish
to dispense with her services. The only
comment made about . the robbery was
that It was expected the bicycle would
be brought back in a few days, but
Rose had nothing to say.

employed to assist in the housework
about four weeks ago. She was un
usually capable, and Mrs. H. Jackson
was much pleased with her.
Two stalwart policemen came quick

pathetic ear was then given to the de

that followed was accounted the rough
greeting.
"I love those two little girls and I
would never think of such a thing as
giving them poison. Mrs. Jackson also
says that I stole her pongee cape and
her silk dress. It is true that I re
turned them after having seen a
strange woman wearing the clothes. I
found them near Ingleside. But it is a
base untruth that I stole them."
i Then the four adult sisters of Rose
Holls worth arrived at the prison and
hysterically advanced on the girl.
"Why did you do it? Why did you do
it?" they cried in unison and arms
were pressed about her angrily, the
meeting developing into a pulling
match that hurt instead of bestowing
the affection the child was""expecting.
"Stop! Stop!" she cried out several
times in protest against the rough
treatment of the sisters.

tion of'Kekeoitai. A division command
ed by Prince Tumanoff forced the en
emy from the village of Hailaosa, on
the right bank of the Hun River, op
posite the* village of Kekeoital. To as
sume a battle formation a detachment
of about 1500 infantry With four guns
and two squadrons, under Lieutenant
Yagodin, supported on the left flank 7 by
another squadron of cavalry, attacked
the enemy's Infantry, who fled to the
village of Hailaosa. We" lost two sol
diers killed and three wounded.
"Oh October 26 a reconnaissance was
made on. our right flank by several de
tachments of sharpshooters. After ait
hour and a half's preparation by fire
from mortars and quick-firing guns the
detachment advanced at 11 p. m. to
ward the villages of Tchailampu and
Bezymianny." The latter was taken by
a'ssault by sharpshooters, the enemy's
force retiring. Two of our officers were
wounded. .
SHANGHAI, Oct. 28.-A private let
ter from Port Arthur, dated October 21,
received here to-day, says:
"General Stoessel wired the -Russian
Emperor and court recently, 'I now bid
you alfgood-by forever. Port Arthur
is my grave," .
"General Stoessel has instilled the
garrison of the beleaguered fortress
with the spirit that to court a glorious
death is preferable to capitulation.
"The Japanese shells are inflicting
ffreat damage to the Russian fleet in
the harbor and to the fortifications^
The arsenal with its contents of am
munition and small arms has been de
stroyed and preparations are being
made for the last deadly struggle at
close quarters. The water supply hav
ing been cut off, wells lire being sunk.
Provisions are scarce. Only tinned
meats being left, the soldiers hold gala
feast on horses killed by shells.
"Certain troops included in the gar
rison have to be closely watched, at
present for fear of desertion or treach
ery. J^C':
"The field and naval hospitals are
crowded and hygienic conditions are
becoming desperate". The bombardment
at times is so incessant that it is im
possible to bury the dead at any depth.
Over one-half of the original garrison
is dead, wounded or sick.
"The high angle at which their ar
tillery fire Is directed by the Japanese
has practically destroyed the new. town.
When the fleet attempted to break
through the blockade some time ago
the garrison was to have made a des
perate sortie and inflict as much dam
age as possible, and, j if necessary,
capitulate. The failure of the fleet to
escape frustrated the plan.
"The besiegers are pressing closer
daily, and It is hard to say how long
we can hold out.. "When the end comes
there will be a desperate fight and a
surprise." Thousands of the enemy will
perish, as everything is mined."
This letter was intrusted to a native
boatman, who ran the blockade and
mailed the same at Chefu. The re
cipient is a prominent continental busi
ness man of this city, with a branch
house at Port Arthur.

BIDS FAREWELL
TO THE CZAR
In vievr . of Balfour*a . scathing de
nunciation of Admiral Rojestvensky, It
I* interesting to note In the, Russian
\ierv he could be in no- way held re
sponsible, though he has generally as
eumed the responsibility. The British
public throughout . the week" has been
crying for RojestvenskyV head, Â¦â but
Russia has firmly pointed out, and Ix>rd
Lansdowne - has . acquiesced, that he Is
"I know, however â I could not help
knowing," said the Embassadorâ "that
there was a British fleet at -Gibraltar.
If our fleet had left Vigo it probably
â¢would have been war, but now all there
Is well. There was only one danger,
namely, the excitement of public opin
ion. To be precise, during the negotia
tions there were never demands upon
cither side but- might have been given
to the public earlier, but it was thought
better to leave everything to Mr. Bal
four to-night." ,.
On thÂ« authority of Count Bencken
dorff It can be said that never at any
time did Foreign Minister Lansdowne
express the belief that a pacific settle
ment was not attainable or endeavor
to secure a settlement by veiled men
ace.
"If," said Balfour, "war could be
averted without dishonor, the settle
ment would reflect nothing but credit
upon the ruler of that great empire
with which we have been so nearly
coming into collision, but with whom
It is my earnest hope and sincere belief
our good relations will remain undis
turbed. I congratulate this country
and Russia, Europe and -the world upon
Â¦what I believe vrlll be the result of
the last few days' negotiations."
A vote of approval of Balfour's con
duct of the negotiations was enthu-
Eiastically passed. â¢
Embassador Benckendorff, who has
been working night and day, to-night
expressed the greatest pleasure over
the result, which he regarded as hon
orable to both nations. Until Premier
Balfour spoke, the Embassador said,
he was bound to silence and hence
much misinformation had pervaded the
British press, which had reiterated the
etatement that Ruesia s had given no
reply to the British note.
The world had its eyes centered upon
one groat, warlike tragedy in the Far
East. It would have been appalling,
but it was not at one moment impos
sible for that great worlds tragedy to
be doubled and what should have been
th** grea.t<?st calamity that could be
fall mankind, namely, a struggle be
tween two first-class powers. Speak
ing for the CVovernrrrent, Mr. Balfour
declared he could say It had done all
it could consistently with honor to
avert that calamity. To say the inci
dent was and over would be
too mtch, but they surely would not
think him oversanguine in hoping the
spirit of reason and Justice which had
brought Great Britain through the
most difficult parts of controversy
without the calamity of war would still
preside over the council of the nations
and the greatest of all calamities, that
of war between two European nations,
â¢would be averted.
HOPES FOR PEACE.
Mr. Balfour thought it must be ad
mitted that the Russian Government
had Khown an enlightened desire that
the truth and justice should prevail.
Only a few hours ago he should him
self have., taken a very gloomy view of
the possibility of a satisfactory' and
peaceful solution. He thought the Czar
had shown himself an enlightened
Judge cf what was right in the mat-
Ver as between nation and nation. The
Lritish Government did not ask of
others anything It would not gladly
have granted if it had been in a similar
jnsition. The Government had no de-
Eire to take advantage of Russia's dif
ficulties to enforce its demands.
Bujtpose etmÂ»e dark night a liner or trans
port fell In with the second Pacific fleet t.t
Gibraltar, where they had Intended to divide,
end approached within the maeic distance?
Xccordiri to the admiral's theory, he would
be justified in sinking it. The position Is one
itr.;>osMbIe for neutrals to tolerate. A. fleet
enimated by this policy would" be a fleet
which would have to be eliminated out 'of ex
istence if civilized commerce was to pursue its
Â¦nay unimi>aired. I am glad to think that in
ihis view the Russian Government agrees, and
has niven orders which will prevent a recur
rence of the tragedy that has filled our hearts
Â¦with sorrow and indignation.
IMPOSSIBLE POSITION'
PjÂ»mÂ«nber. Â«h* wheel! at diplomacy move
Â«!or.!y. asd perhaps the wheel* of Russian di
plomacy especially slowly, but It should be
honim In niird that thÂ« tragedy was not
known until Monday and tbe Uov-mment at
eace expressed its norrcw anil prcrri*ed rep-'
eratior. and at thÂ» tery oeginmng intimated
that any wrongdoer cu<ht to receive |>unUh
ment. One difficulty w?ui thai the fl^et
committed the outrage was en its way to the
illimitable Ka*t. That :i if Acuity has bÂ«*n rot
Beat; but there ts rjiolher d faculty, namtly,
that the Ru&slan adn-.iraJ lias a tlx-ory cf the
rtstt* and duties of a belligerent fleet as
against neutrals which would really make the
fciÂ£h seaÂ£ a place of public danger.
It Is Impossible to tlouat which iÂ« tliÂ« cor
*Â»:-.t etcrj'. I ehouU not have apfÂ»roa<;lieJ It
Lut for the fact that the. admiral's sf>ry !â¢
real'* ar. attack uson cur rational honor an.1
Urdies that we -ire not doing ouÂ»- duty as
neutrals. In an Island kingdom like Â«;reat
Britain the nationality of every craft Is
known. It la inconceivable that we couM be
fcarborSnjr Japanese steamers and warships
w:th.Oiit Russia and. Indeed, the whole clvil
lred world knotrlne it. After a most em
phatio protfltt acainrt such an allegation the
tri'th will be manifest and clear as noonday
*hen thm Inquiry lc held, which in most
stateemanlifce manner haa been welcomed by
tbÂ» Czar. l*ut In bare Justice to the Crar
Â«ji4 thÂ« nufSJas Government I -will say they
lJ*\Â«*r at any tf'r.e unSerestitcaled the gravity
of the crisis.
In the etory of our flEbinnen there was
touch tragedy, but no romance: In the rtory
of the Russian admiral there Is no traeady.
but I am driven ti the belief that there is
Xnurb romance.
SOUTHAMPTON. Oct J8.â Premier
Balfour addressed an immense meeting
In Artillery HaU to-night. His appear
ance on the platform at 8:05 o'clock
the signal for great cheering,
was again and again renewed.

ROJESTVENSKY'S REPORT.
"There never was," to quote Count
Benckendorff, "any question of apology
and compensation. These were freely
conceded early in the week. The only
approach to a hitch occurred in con
nection with the question of guarantee
of punishment. When those differences
appeared acute the whole situation was
changed by the appearance of Rojest
vensky*s report. That was obviously
made in good faith. It is possible our
j admiral's subordinates made the mis-
I take; neither he nor they are infallible.
That they made a mistake In hitting
trawlers is, obvious; that they were
mistaken in believing they saw torpedo
boats remains to be proved. But If
they are not infallible, how much less
bo are the fishermen?"
The greatest relief was . exhibited in
all diplomatic circles when the news of
the settlement arrived. As has been
stated in dispatches, the best Informed^
opinion never inclined to* the belief thar
war would ensue, in spite of the
enormous naval preparations and the
bellicose tendency of the press. "
SAVANNAH. Ga.. Oct. 28.â So far aa '
the taking of evidence is concerned,
[ the defense of Captain O. Ml Carter In
t the suits instituted against him by the
j Government was completed to-day
i when Colonel J. B. Quinn of the Gov
' ernment engineering department was
; examined by United States Commis
sioner Hewlett.
Colonel Quinn was examined as to his
I opinion of the cost of the work done on
the Savannah harbor under Captain
Carter. He said he thought the cost to
, the Government was normal. When
asked what condition the walls and
, jetties constructed by Captain Carter
i were In. he replied that they were in
| perfect shape and were wearing well.
' Mr. Stone, Captain Carter's counsel
j In the hearing, says the evidence ad
duced will tend to Carter's vindication.
j He asserts that the contentions of the
Government's attorneys that they
, traced every dollar of Carter's money
: is a bit of evidence which in Itself is
\ more valuable to prove the innocence
of Carter than to prove his guilt.
J.It will be impossible to secure the
names of the dead and injured to-night.
Nearly all : the" J miners employed are
Slavs. The f mine is a new one, opened
only a year ago and extended two
thousand feet into the hill. The ex
plosion is supposed to have been caused
by dust. Only one body has been re
covered, that of T. Duran, a driver,
who was just entering the tunnel when
the explosion occurred. He was torn
and burned almost beyond recognition.
All mines within a radius of two miles
have been shut down and the miners '
are on the way to assist in rescuing
the bodies of the victims. . j
FAREWELLi TO AliEXIEFF.
The shaft in .which the accident oc
curred works eighty men and it is be
lieved that at least sixty men were in
the mine; at the time. News of the
explosion "brought assistance from the
adjacent camps and to-night hundreds
of men are trying to get into the mine.
Deadly fumes "â¢ overcome the rescuers
frequently, but' their places are im
mediately taken by others to risk their
lives. It is not thought possible that
any one in, the. mine can escape death
if they are not' all' dead already.
Immediately after the explosion, which was
for all- the. world like a volcanic eruption,
there was --the wildest excitement. Men,
women and children rushed to the mouth of
the tunnel and women whose husbands were
in the mine had to be brought away by miners
to keep them from beinjc killed by deadly
fumea from the mouth of the tunnel.
I was standing not more than 300 yards
.irom the mouth' of the tunnel when the ex
plosion occurred. The explosion was preceded
by a low." rumbling sound resembling an
earthquake, which made the earth tremble and
startled" the whole camp. , Â¦
I . looked toward the mine and out of the
mouth of the tunnel and two air shafts came
a great volume of smoke and dust which con
tinued for nearly a minute. Out of the two
air shafts, each of .which Is seven feet in
diameter, timbers that were fully from two to
three feet in diameter were shot into the air
and broken Into splinters. Bocks were thrown
over the camp (or a distance of a quarter of
a mile. In fact it rained rock, broKen timbers
and all kinds ot. debris for- fully a minute, and
many people were Injured by being struck
with these missiles. _ ..
TRINIDAD, Colo., Oct. 28.â The most
terrific explosion in;the history of coal
mining in Colorado occurred at. mine
No. 3 of the Rocky Mountain Fuel and
Iron Company at Teroio, forty miles
west of Trinidad, at. 1:30 o'clock 'this
afternoon, and the s number of dead is
variously placed at between thirty and
sixty men. . The number reported as
having gone into the mine this morn
ing .was seventeen miners and four
company men. This afternoon many
more miners are known to have, gone
into the mine and the exact' number
of dead. may never be, known, as the
mine is burning and in all* likelihood
the bodies will be cremated., , A .large
number of mine officials j left here as
soon as word of the, accident was re
ceived. Company doctors were, picked
up all along the line as well as all
other available? physicians. : United
States Government Stock Inspector
Foreman was at Teroio when the'ex
plosion occurred. He returned to-night
and gives the following account of: the
affair: vt "
All efforts of the physicians and
nurses to get him to submit to modern
treatment have, proved futile. He be
lieves if his wounds heal he will die.

RICH STRIKE IS REPORTED

PASSES INTO EASTERN HANDS
Mrs. Hirschfeld scoffs at the police
theory that any one of her guests took
the diamonds. The box in which the
stolen gems were returned gives no
clew to the thief. Though evidently a
novice in crime, [ the robber was cun
ning enough to refrain from using his
or her handwriting to address the
package.
While Mrs. Hirschfeld is satisfied
with the return of her: property and is
not anxious to press the case, the police
are still attempting to run the robber
down. They claim that an arrest may
be made which will cause a sensation.
Detectives DInan and Wren, who were
detailed on the case, suspected that
some one who was familiar with the
household affairs of the Hirschfelds was
the thief.
The robbery occurred under peculiar
circumstances. The Jewels were stolen
from their hiding place under a mat
tress in a bedroom of the Hirschfeld
residence a week ago Thursday, while
Mrs. Hirschfeld was giving a birthday
reception.
The diamonds stolen from the resi
dence of Mrs. Emil Hirschfeld, at 1373
Masonic avenue, were returned yester
day to the owner by mall. This fact and
other corcumstances connected with the
robbery point to the work of an ama
teur thief, who was probably a woman.
The precious stones, valued at $2500,
were in a small box, such as is used to
hold a manicure set. When the letter
carrier delivered the box at Mrs.
Hirschf eld's door it was wrapped in
plain manila paper. There was no
handwriting on the package. It was ad
dressed by means of clippings of .a
newspaper account of the robbery,
reading:. "Mrs. Emil Hirschfeld, 1373
Hafecnic avenue. The San Francisco â "
The package arrived â¢ after Emil
Hirschfeld left his home yesterday
morning to consult with Captain Bur
nett. While he was discussing the af
fair with the captain Mrs. Hirschfeld
arrived and joyfully announced that the
missing jewels had been returned.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 28. â A Coroner's
jury to-day decided that the death of
Mrs. Mary E. Riddle, who died a
couple of days ago, was due to septic
poisoning through neglect of medical
aid.' Dr. Howard B. Gates, who had
been called 'in at the last moment, re
fused to sign a death certificate.
Mrs.' Riddle had been 111 for many
years and had tried many physicians.
William Farwell of the Home ot Truth
had been called into the case about
ten days before her death and had
treated her. J. W. Riddle testified
that his wife had received the most
relief from the Home of Truth treat
ment, at one time recovering her
strength after being in an apparently
dying condition.
Dr. H. B. Gates, who made the au
topsy, said he had been summoned
to attend Mrs. Riddle and found .her
beyond relief. , .William Farwell. when

WOODLAND. Oct. 28.â Peter Veil
strup, keeper of ,the wampum "of the
lcrcal tribe of Order of Red Men, to-day
confessed to' his fellow members that
he has been systematically appropriat
ing the f unds, of the tribe to his* own
use. He" begged .the members to deal
with him according to the ; law, but to
save his bondsmeni "
Veilstrup is a 'Â¦''- charter .member of
Shawnee r Tribe of Woodland' and has
held .the- office of, keeper of the wam
pum, which corresponds to treasurer in
other orders, for > several years. His
first theft, he said, was five years ago,'
when he helped himself to $50. ' The
treasury of the tribe is now depleted
and Veilstrup. with sobs, admitted that
he is responsible for it. . It is estimated
that his thefts have exceeded $1000.
Veilstrup is now in the County Hos
pital, whither he went a few days ago.
It develops that his ailment is caused
by constant' worry over his dishonest
administration of his office. A com
mittee of his 'fellow Red Men waited
upon him yesterday to attend to some
financial matters. It was then that^he
admitted that the treasury. was empty
and told of his crime. . The District At
torney has been apprised of the facts,
but -is waiting for some one to swear
out a complaint for Veilstrup's arrest.
The Red Men have not yet acted.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 28.â Judge Rhodes
to-day handed down an opinion in
which he overruled the demurrers of
the, Bay; Cities Water Company to the
complaint In , the suit brought by
Charles. Hill to. restrain the company
from diverting the waters of Coyote
Creek at a point where they sink into
underground strata, forming, so tbe
plaintiff alleges, an artificial supply
from Coyote station to Alviso.
Judge Rhodes enters fully . into the
law governing the use of subsurface
waters and the right to restrain by in
junction any Interference with its use
by landowners beneath whose soil they
flow, and he deals minutely with the
physical features of this valley, show
ing the formation of soil and strata,
the sources and trend of the subsurface
waters and their necessity to the fruit
growers. He sustains the plaintiffs
contention as to the law, throwing upon
the defendant the task of proving that
the physical facts in this " particular
case are not such as would come under
the law as Interpreted by the court.
- The fruit growers in a large section
of the vallev are convinced that upon
the outcome of the suits against the
company depends the future success or
failure of their crops, and this decision
is hailed by them as a distinct victory
at the initial stage of the proceedings.

TACOMA, Oct. 23.â In Jumping from

on the tender, seeing the engineer and
fireman had gone, went -into t the cab,
put on all the sand he could and kept
the brakes on until the train came to a
stop after a run of about one mile. He
was uninjured, and had Fireman Kist
ner not Jumped his life would have been
spared.
"For God's sake, jump," was the ex
clamation heard from the engineer, ac
cording to the statement made by
French. The engineer and fireman
dropped off, and seeing the cab vacant
French jumped to the engineer's post
arid saved the train. Frank Lainrey.
another brakeman, remained on the
water car during the frightful ride.
Conductor Cooper and the brakeman
went back' in â¢ search of the engineer
and the fireman.' Davis was found safe,
having alighted all right, but the body
of Kistner was found by the side of the

to be Stanford footballists, were cleared

Judge Cabaniss showed that , Kelly ac

whereupon he "tackled" his assailant,
while his companion* took care in simi
lar manner of the officer who dashed to

tion, witnesses ' testified. . when their op

that Kelly was Justified in; protecting
himself from being unjustly clubbed.
Seaman Barngrover was saved from
unseemly ; slumber by the . summoning
of another witness.
"Oh, I don't know,'* he yawned in re
sponse to the court's query as to how
many shots were fired. "There was a
scrap, I guess," he continued, behind a
tarry hand, "and I guess some shooting
was done. Two kid soldiers were there,
and (yawn) one fired a pistol. A bullet
or two (yawn) hit m* in the clothes,
and (yawn) 1 didn't pay much atten

Then it was that Miss Faix com
menced the oration that figuratively
prostrated the prosecution, the bench
and the attorneys' table and finally
compelled her dismissal. For seven
and one-quarter minutes by Clerk
Barney Conlan's watch she talked
without cessation, ignoring alike, the
attempted interruption of opposing
counsel. and the would-be restraining
gestures of the Judge. What she
said was not intelligible to any of her
hearers, until she , abruptly elevated
her voice from an even monotone to
a C sharp declaration that she was riot
a "Dutch pig" and would not allow
any living person to address her by
such an appellation. When nature
eventually asserted itself and forced
her. to a prolonged breathing intake
the Judge took advantage of the op
portunity to continue the hearing one
calendar month and inform the de
fendant that she was at liberty to go
forth on her own recognizance. Then,
before she could resume her harangue
the bailiff cleared the witness stand
and called the . next case. >
"And it is my sincere wish," said
his Honor, ; as \ Miss \ Faix swept ma
jestically through the congregated and
somewhat disappointed opposition,
"that I may nev^r.see any of you peo
ple againâ or at least until human In
genuity .invents , and ...an', indulgent
Board of Supervisors equips this
court with a device for the silencing
of witnesses who . are afflicted with

perienced." * ,V;V A
Miss Annie Falx, a "buxom- brunette
.of, unmistakable Teutonic nativity,
talked herself Into the court of Po
lice Judge CabanisR and then delib
erately talked her way out again. She
was formally accused of having dis
.turbed.the peace of Mrs. A. Dodge of
1549 Twenty-second street by saying
things. It was not the quality of the
language complained of-^although
that was harassing enough â that " ex
asperated Mrs. Dodge*.* She could make
allowance ] for educational Imperfec
tions, and had "always done so. But
the .quantity of words exploded by
Miss Faix, combined with the futility
of attempting to either check or es
cape the torrential flow,, was . more
than human patience could passively
endure. Much as she' disliked drag
ging herself or : any one else into pub
licity via the. Police Court route, Mrs.
Dodge could devise no other means of
obtaining permanent relief' from un
merited persecution by the, defend
ant's tongue: She would ask for no
other penalty than that of restraint.
No, she was not the only person who
had suffered from . Miss Faix's pen
chant for speaking. Right there in
court were about thirty other folk
who would corroborate every word
she had' said. Among, those present"
were H. B. Dodge, Miss Maxwell, F.
Comstock, W. L. Funk, another Mrs.
Dodgeâ but why enumerate the list?
They were there and ready to testify.
. Judge Conlan continued till Novem
ber 4 the case of Thomas Thornton,
alias George "Wilson, charged with hav
ing' stolen a diamond pin from Amon
G. Carter, of 107 New Montgomery
street. There are two similar accusa
tions against the same defendant, and
they will be taken up after the Carter
complaint has been disposed of. â¢
. Eleven matrons from Bartel street,
in the Latin quarter, were ready to
testify for or against SIgnora Sunta
ZuchclH, who accused Signora Ales
sandrino Graziani of having assaulted
her with lists and sticks and stones for
no provocative cause whatsoever. Seven
of the ladies had dark-eyed babes in
arms, and the infants Insisted on re^
ceiving maternal attention to the ex
clusion of everything else. As Judge
Cabaniss could not, even if he would,
punish them for contempt of court,
he continued the case and suggested
that when the witnesses return they
neglect to bring their tyrannical in-
John Murray was whipping: a re-,
luctant horse ~ attached to a wagon
load of wood when a policeman arrest
ed him on the Wisconsin-street hill,
and before Judge Mogan he pleaded
that he was forced to apply the lash
to keop the animal from, being dragged
backward down the declivity â¢ by the
vehicle. This explanation, coupled with
his confession that he was an ama
teur teamster, obtained his dismissal.
James McCauley calmly ignored the
admonitory clanging of the gripman'a
bell, the shouting of the excited con
ductor and the yelling of the impatient
passengers as he drove his horse . and
wagon along the Larkin-street rail
road. Patrolman Cottle, who happened
to be among the passengers, arrested
the obdurate teamster after the latter
had : defiantly declared ' that he would
not "turn out for any d â d railroad
company." Before Judge Cabaniss Mr.
McCauley denied that he had uttered
any" profanity and pleaded that consid
eration for the feelings .of his horse â
a rather sensitive animal â was the
cause of his delay in clearing the track.
For neglecting to consider the feelings
of the passengers, who. were in>a hurry
to arrive somewhere, he was fined $5.
C. L.. Borreben was flourishing a re
volver, pf antique pattern and terroriz
ing the crew of a Hayes-street car
when his arrest occurred. As the
weapon was unloaded and as the de
fendant pleaded that It must have been
placed in his pocket by some practical
joker Judge Mogan dismissed the case.
, Judge Fritz sent two. men "separately
accused of felony to answer in the Su
perior Courjt, with the bail of each fix
ed at $2000. John McCormick was
charged with having stolen some small
change from the pocket of a man who
was asleep in a water-front saloon,
and George W. Tyrrell's alleged of
fense consisted of passing a forged
check.
Richard Lasco of 264 Michigan street
told- Mrs. John Ebert.of 352 Michigan
street that while he' would not direct
ly accuse her husband of chicken steal
ing he* was inclined to believe that if
the hen missing from his coop had
strayed into the Ebert;yard it would
not have been ; "shooed" out' again by
either.Mr.qr Mrs. Ebert". 4 Very wroth
waxed ' Mr. Ebert when his wife in
formed him of .'what Mr. Lasco had
said, and; he at once visited that gen
tleman '[ and vigorously , resented the
imputation cast upon his character, but
did- "not', commit batiery â¢ or even
threaten to do so, MrT Lasco's testi
mony to the contrary notwithstanding.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed the case on
thecground that the taxpayers of San
Francisco could not a/Cord to have $*
worth of his time consumed in adjudi
cating a dispute over, a stx-bit chicken.

Egyptian tyranny, but not understand
ing what' liberty * meant, -they pleaded
to 'let 'well enough alone, saying, that
it ; were . better to be < a slave in Egyp.t
than starve -â¢ in ' : the .wilderness. This

POPULAR YOUNG WOMAN' WHO
LED THE GERMAN AT THE
ENTRE NOUS COTILLON.-
It is thought that the old gentleman
must have taken the poison some time
during the early morning hours. To
his note he added a postscript that re
quested his wife to see a Mr. Ed
wards. "He will aid you," he said.
Mr. Edwards has left the city tempo
rarily. He is a broker at 303 Califor
nia street and had had business deal
ings with deceased. The unfortunate
suicide was 68 years of age.
"My poor unfortunate wife: Put up
with the Inevitable. You have been
strong and tried in misfortune. Bet
ter without me than with me. I am
almost crazy. God watcii over you
all." : Â¦::"Â¦%?.}
Before death the suicide wrote a
letter In German to his wife, which
translated reads:
Mr. Lichtenberg had been in busi
ness twenty years in this city. He en
gaged in a general shipping and com
mission trade and was agent for sev
eral commercial houses in Hanover,
Germany, his birthplace. At one
time he \ca* considered a Â¦wealthy
man, but speculation decreased his
capital and in late years he has had
a hard time making both ends meet.
However, his two sons are alive and
they claim the financial situation with
the family was not so that
the old gentleman should have taken
it so seriously.
Edward Lichtenberg, the eldest son,
was much grieved over his father's
death. He said that his father did not
come home last night and this greatly
â¢worried the family. The Lichten
bergs reside at 2224 California street.
Depressed by a long series of busi
ness reverses that had slowly drained
him of his wealth. Rudolph Lichten
berg, a merchant and broker doing
business at 303 California street, took
his own life some time yesterday
morning. Death is supposed to have
been caused by cyanide poisoning.
The body was found by some boys
who were playing in Golden Gate
Park. It was in the brush opposite
the half-mile post of the speedway.
Xo bottle was found near the spot,
although a careful search was made
by the Coroner's deputies, who were
summoned to take charge of the re
mains.

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 28.â The principal
business before the Trans-Mississippi
Congress to-day, was a discussion of
resolutions. Thirty recommendations
embracing many subjects were pre
sented. ' .
Portland, Or., was selected as the
next place of meeting of the congress.
The report of the committee on reso

says:
.The Tombstone consolidated # mines at
Tombstone, Arizona, are pumping 3,
000,000 gallons, of water a day. Sinking
continues.' In three shafts the mines
are' operating 100 feet below the former
water level. ' ,
â¢ At Cripple Creek all the water-flooded mines
have been so far drained as to Justify deepen
lrÂ» ' the shafts and the . driving of new levels.
Bodies of , payable material have been ' opened
and .partly, developed In the last six months.
Before the strike of 1003 the Cripple Creek ton
nage ran from: 35. 000 to 60.000 tons per month.
Now.lt reaches over C0.00O, with all the older
mines In producing condition and new ones
brorzht In. .'
The : Mining , World claims that the
Cripple \Creek- district in. Colorado is
employing more men and raising more
ore than at any previous time. The
ore output of September was about $2,
000,000." Leasers are opening new ground
arfd operating old mines and a very
large production is predicted* rhe paper
continues :V v'^ ;
-The cyanide era for Cripple Creek appears
to have come. ; The 'mills erected and under
construction will have a capacity for treating
2000: tons or more of ore per. day, and several
hundred. tons more mill capacity Is being con
sidered and may- be put under construction at
any time. , There , appears to be cyanidlng. ore
enough to^run these mills 'for years. It opens
possibilities ' for- production little realized
heretofore. It need not surprise any one It
the\cyan!dlnff plants of the. district within ':a
year or two would be treating , a tonnage con
siderably, larger than the present total tonnage
of- the; camp. Â¦ The production of. high-grade
ore does not diminish, but rather appears to
Increase. -The camp is a marvel and a sur
prise.- .â¢ . .
'.The Mining and Scientific Press re
ports concerning the work of draining
the Cripple Creek mines as follows: .
| The opening of the New York under

The meeting was the outcome of â¢ a â¢ long
continued factional fight between the McKane-
Kernick division on the one side and the Tay
lor-McClelland party on the other. For several
months it' has been a foregone conclusion that
sooner or- later- the differences arising ovs; the
management of the Jumbo, one of the greatest
gold mines in the world, would result in -a
parliamentary contest. . . : .
Peculation ia rife as to the results of .the
meetinr. . The prevailing opinion Is that sev
eral suits may be Hied. As yet no legal com
plications have, been engendered. Â¦ McKane, it
is said, has made threats to secure redress in
case he . was deposed Â¦ from the presidency of
the company. He â¢* in the East at present.
His return to Tonopah will be looked forward
ti with much interest by the stockholders of
the Jumbo Mining Company.

McKane, president, and George Ker

Company at Goldfield have been super

TROUBLE AT GOLDFIELD.
A visit was made to the new district yester
day. Little or no development, work had been
done. Bryan,~ Doi sey and Phillips,' the dis
coverers, - wÂ«re Â¦ busily ens ased in breaking uv
and sorting the rich cropplngs and racking the
best' o? 'it: this is 'expected 'to* go at' least $2
a ;>ound. The large dyke, in which is the
led_o, stands out boldly and extends for fuiÂ»y
400O feet. It runs in a ' northeaBterly anil
southwesterly direction. - August Seller owns
the- Hermlne, an extension 'of the Jump "Up
Joe. and his ; end line is within 150 feet of
the discovery. Krebs, Edm'ston and Murphey
of Bridreport aliÂ«o have a valuable extension.
Claims have been â¢ staked for < two miles in
every direction from" the new ' strike. Wood
and water are plentiful an"d everything; " Is
favorable for a new mining camp.. Everybody
is busily engaged in dorng the ten feet' of work
reculrt-d by,the law of the district.
It is reported that one company, the
Standard of Bodle, pajd $5000 for the
privilege of working two men on one
property, for -seven days. The. owners
are sacking. rock of which every piece
shows free gold. Among the properties
that are working are the Jump Up Joe,
True Friend group, the Hermene, the
Bat and the^Myrtle andJulla mines..*
The' Bodle Miner-Index, also says of
the-Masonic region:
. ; Miners in Mono County are actively
engaged in developing the new mining
district at -Masonic^ Mountain and- it
will not.be the fault of the Chronicle-
Union if the, region fails to becornje
well known. The journal reports that
the excitement increases, reports of
new.: finds reach Bridgeport every day
and that men are 'coming and going
to and from -the district . at all times.
The surrounding country is. being lo
cated for miles in. every direction, the
lecations extending into A
townsite will be- â¢ surveyed soon j and
building has begun. The main street
of the new town has-been selected. l

.A Case *of Dyspepsia*
Dyspepsia is caused by acotc inflammattop^f
the nerves of the stomach. _^ _, '^^\
It is by nervous energy that the muscles Of
the. stomach contract and expand, and the df.
gestive fluids are secreted. The mtrscular walls
of the stomach must be kept,in vigorous action
until the' process of digestion is made complete.
The nerve fibres, like other tissues of the
body, may become .inflamed and by
neglect or, other causes ; then they must be
nourished and their strength restored. It is
when the nerve fibres are overstrained by
worry of mind, overtaxing or neglect that they
become exhausted and weak. _:â .
: Dyspepsia : is but one instance^where . the
vital nerve force is necessary: _ ' '
' " : Discontent^ ill-temper ? low spirits, despond-
ency, dizziness, sick headache, heartburn, pal-
pitation of the heart, distension of- the stomach,
are some of the many forms^that dyspepsia
takes.- \_ * ;â¢ \- J '-''' "~j_"~ Â¦
.The true~" cure- must be the "restoration to
strength of the nerves which govern the digestive
organs. " """ "* . ._ -^ .
MISS FARRELL'S-'CASETAN' EXAMPLE
OF' THOUSANDS.
"I have been greatly benefited by the uiÂ»
of Paine's Celery Compound. Until I tried
it I was a great sufferer from dyspepsia and
constipation. I spent considerable money,
trying various preparations without sue-'
cess, until I tried the Compound/ Before I
completed the first bottle I noticed a change.
.for the better, but I continued until I had,
taken -six bottles in all, which effected an;-
entire cure. I - feel | better to-day than I
have at any period of my life.' It afford*
me great pleasure to Indorse Paine's Celery .
Compound.- Lydla J. Farrell, 129 DeKalb
Avenue, Brooklyn, N. Y, August 12, 1904.
Paine's Celery Compound is curing thou-.
sands of dyspeptics every day,* in just this way.'
By feeding and- restoring, the nerves to their
full strength. It never.' fails to cure.
Sick : headache, palpitation, dizziness,^ 1 ' and
heartburn are usually relieved by a single dose
of Paine's Celery Compound. . ;
' Remember this,-â Paine's Celery ; Compound is
the prescription of one of the most famous physi-
cians this country has ever known, and all repu-
table Druggists sell and recommend it.

Put the , spirit of chivalry ... first. I have
listened. in your football games for a cheer for
the defeated team, but generally it has been
a case of "thumbs down." I ask you, as
president" of a great athletic club, to take. up
football seriously and make of football a game
worthy . of your great university, a game gov
erned | by the high . Meals and the - noble laws
which governed the tourneys of knights of old.
Rev; Bradford Leavitt, pastor of the
First Unitarian Church of San Fran
cisco, also addressed the university," his
subject being, "What All the World's
&-Seeklng." He urged the cultivation
cf body, mind and. spirit, as aids to
securing happiness. Physical hap
piness, he said, is dependent on exer
cise and right living. Mental happiness
Is 'dependent on use of the mind to
form" Independent conclusions. .; Spirit
ual happiness depends on reconciliation
to God, or harmony with the. power
that rules the universe.
Why have you not won success on the water?
Why have you made, your greatest suc

given more time â too much timeâ to the least
desirable college sport. Football Is a grand
game, but "not as you play it, since In the
form you play It It is not a chivalrous sport.
Modern -- football, as distinguished from * the
old, orlelnal same is merely a head-on colli

OAKLAND, Oct. 28.â There is trouble
over a sewer in the fashionable part
uf the city and George H. Wheaton and
M. W. Kales, both, prominent in social
and business circles, have gone to law
about the pipe leading, out of ; their
back yards.
Their homes adjoin in the Lakeside
district, being situated at the corner
uf Lake and Jackson etreets. The sewer
over which the trouble has arisen has
been used by a number of the residents
of that part of the city for j the last
quarter of a century. Kales has threat
ened to dig it up. -
As far back as 1876, Wheaton states
in his petition, he and several of his
neighbors clubbed together and built a
private- sewer. Henry H. More, 'who
then owned the property which Kales
has since purchased, gave a perpetual
right to those interested in the matter
to maintain euch a sewer and run it
under the back* cf his premises. In 18S7
Kales bought the property â¢ with
knowledge of the sewer and the ar-
rangement and for some time used It
himself. Then trouble arose and the
sewer has been the cause of a rupture
and a . cutting off pt diplomatic re
lations.
Kales objects to: the sewer. It is
further. alleged he has' refused to allow
his neighbors to have the pipe repaired
where it runs through his premises.
They are in daily danger of being
flooded out of their homes and he has
now threatened to. dig up the objec
tionable pipe and cast It out into the
street. In this extremity the courts
have been appealed ..to' and Wheaton
has asked for an Injunction to restrain
Kales from carrying out his expressed
purpose.
â¢The sewer has been the bone of con
tention between the men for some time
in different ways has come up be
fore the City Council and ' the street
committee, but now that it has been
taken into the courts it is expected
that, like the famous Jones County calf
case, it will afford material for suits
for years to come.
Wiese has been superintendent- of
the municipal electric, plant for more
than ten years. Frequent rows with
Trustee Bowers, who is' chairman of
the light plant committee, are the di
rect cause of his enforced resignation.
J. B. Kahn of San Francisco has made
application for the position. .
ALAMEDA, Oct. 28.â After confer
ring with City Trustees J., F. Forderer,
C. J. Hammond and B. E. Combs to
day, Superintendent G. A. Wiese' of
the municipal electric light and power
department agreed to tender his resig
nation, to take effect the first of De
cember. The demand- of City Trustee
W. M. I Bowers for Wiese's removal
will be complied with and that official
will continue to remain a member of.
the municipal board instead . of retir
ing, as he declared he would, if his
recommendation for the superintend
ent's removal were not supported.
"When Forderer, Hammond and
Combs had persuaded Wiese that his
resignation was imperative he consent
ed to leave the employ of the city at
the end of next month, and a letter ex
plaining the agreejnent was drafted
and forwarded to Bowers.

â¢ BÂ«ar this In mind. . Since the beginning the
nations - owning - the ' shipping have done - the
business of the world. Statistics prove that a
prosperous - shipping ' community . means pros
perity to every occupation. Do you, as a citi
zen, a voter; a farmer or a laboring man, want
to . see your shipping diverted to Seattle and
the. trade accruing from a large merchant ma
rine leave your State simply for the want of a
vote from you to upbuild It?
The Congressional Commission pagstded over
by_ United - States Senator Gaillnger, which ! re
cently heard -testimony. In San Francisco for
the purpose of devising means for the encour
agement and betterment of 'American shipping,
wasstrongly in favor as si rrieans to those ends
of 'the passage of this amendment. ' .: â¢Â» â¢
Besides paying Us share of State and county
taxes, shipping: paid to the Harbor Commission
era of San. Francisco for the year ending June
SO. * 1JKH, dues to the amount of
$1,008,281 69. Shipping 1b alio to pay
the $2,000,000 it Is proposed the Commissioners
should borrow to make improvements necessary
to the harbor of San Francisco. In practically
every great foreign port the coat of sivh Im
provements Is borne by tiational and local tax
ation. Besides this, the charges against ship
ping In tho port of San Francisco are notori
ously excessive; dock charges are the highest
or any port In the world.
The voters of the State of Washington will
vote next month upon an amendment to their
constitution exempting shipping from taxation.
We are advised the amendment will be carried
In Washington; California shipping will then
seek Seattle as a port of .registry with the re
sult that California will not collect taxes upon
the shipping which is now. registered here. The
steamers of the Pacific Mail are registered in
New Tork because New %York exempts ship
ping from taxation;. the steamers of the Pacific
Mall do not pay taxes in California. The busi
ness and policy of the Pacific Mail are directed
from New York. It builds -its ships' in the
Hast; the Union Iron Works here in San Fran
cisco can build them as cheaply and as well.
Shipping registered In Seattle will be controlled
from* Seattle,, with the result that little by lit
tle the \. business of building ships, outfitting
them, etc., will slip away from California.
: Many owners of vessels , in California have
no other property than their vessels. Owners
wlsh^to have repairs done under their super
vision and to purchase their supplies them
selves.,-To. the loss of ' the . shipping add the
loss to the owners of drydocks, ship chandlers,
laborers and '. others. 'Ship captains and their
families live In the same ports as the owners.
They., also .will move away. .,../.,â¢:.,.. Â¦, ...
In support; of the proposed constitu
tional amendment to exempt shipping
in, this State from taxation it was said
by leading advocates of the measure in
this city .'. yesterday that England,
France, Germany, the States of ,New
York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Il
linois,; Wisconsin and all the' large and
prosperous seaboard States of the
Union by law make such exemption as
is asked for in California. >In addition
to exemption , from taxation France
gives large bounties to" Its; shipping in
the, shape"*' of construction bounties,
outfitting bounties,* mileage bounties,
etc. England and Germany pay large
subsidies..*'
California taxes its shipping,, so it is
set forth in a circular* that has been
prepared for the information of the
voters, who will decide the fate of the
proposed amendment to the constitu
tion of the State, and therein it is as
serted that the State does not con
tribute one cent to aid shipping from
either the State or of the county treas
uries. The circular is about to be
mailed to voters. In part it is as fol
lows: . %
A- charge .of , conspiracy was lodged
yesterday against the Retail Fruit
Dealers ' of San . Francisco' by Adolph
Levy and ': Jacob Levy, who sue for
damages in the sum of $26,100 for an
alleged attempt by the organization to
destroy Athe plaintiffs' business as
wholesale dealers in fruit, berries and
produce. -Twenty-three members and
numerous "Does" are named aa de
fendants. .. '
. The, Levy's', declare that the associa
tion .was organized for the mutual pro
tection of its members, and it Includes
practically ! all of -the retail dealers in
thatline in the city. The defendants,
it is said, for the purpose of controlling
the retail. trade and securing the hotel
and restaurant trade and | preventing
competition therein, have conspired to
injure the plaintiffs' business. They
have notified all 'the customers who
have been .dealing with the â¢ plaintiffs
to discontinue | their trade, and . havti
notified the otlffer wholesalers not ! to
sell such customers any produce under
threat of boycott. Because of this in
timidation, it is alleged, several cus
tomers have ceased, to deal with the
Levys, and they, have a large quantity
of | fruit "and berries on. hand which
have become "worthless. In this they
are damaged "In the sum of $100, , and
the business t has suffered $1000 dam
age, ; to which $25,000 is added.
Members of the association seen yes
terday declare that the Levys cannot
prove their allegations and that there
is no boycott nor any fine imposed upon
the members who deal with the con
cern. In support of their, position the
retailers charge that the Levy firm has
been selling fruit and produce . to the
restaurants, and other customers as
cheaply and cheaper .than to the re-,
.tailers. . As a matter of.self-protection, ?
they say, this must be combated.
It was 'intimated by one of the re
tailers interviewed that - the suit is
backed by "other wholesalers, who are
said to have had wind of the intention
of : the retailers to establish a co-oper
ative "wholesale establishment, where
all can buy on favorable terms.
The doughty captain's manner rather
than his authority and his language
rather than his logic won the chief
wharfinger's admiration. He consid
ered that a bluff like that deserved the
whole pot, so he laid his hand down
and left the Marion in the berth. So
the naval reserve battleship proudly
flies her flag over her guns and Foley
is an ensign in the State militia and a
captain in the United States navyâ
and his rights there is none to dispute.
By this time the Marion had settled
back in her old home and the chief
wharfinger threatened to order out the
State tug Governor Markham to tow
the ship from the dock. Then Ensign
Foley figuratively wrote U. S. N. after
his name and played his big trump.
He informed the State official that the
Marion was the property of the United
States Government and he as her com
mander was an officer (a the United
States navy. If any person not prop
erly authorized by the Secretary of the
Navy attempted to interfere with the
sloop of war Marion he would, by vir
tue of his rank, declare martial law
on Folsom-street wharf No. 2 and pre
vent such attempt at all hazards. Then
Captain Foley ordered the cook, who
was acting as chief of staff, to signal
the flagship Pensacola for permission
to begin firing.
For several years the naval militia
vessel has been moored at one wharf
and another along the water front.
Often the docks are crowded and the
chief wharfinger has been obliged to
move the Marion to make room for
â¢ome cargo ship. Captain Foley al
ways filed a vigorous objection each
time the State's navy was dragged out
of her berth, but the needs of com
merce came first.
When the Marion returned from
Mare Island reoently she hauled into
her old mooring place at Folsom No. 2,
and the -wharfinger ordered her out into
the stream. Captain Foley in full uni
form stood on the quarterdeck of the
handsome, freshly painted, spick and
span sloop of war and wanted to know
who was standing on that dock order
ing that ship around the country- He
was told that the person was the
wharfinger. Then in picturesque lan
guage he asked what a wharfinger was.
When informed he averred that the
cemmanding officer of the Marion out
ranked a wharfinger. All this time the
vessel was moving slowly but surely
into her old berth. Finally Foley re
fused to confer with a subordinate of
ficial and the chief wharfinger was
called, who curtly announced that the
Marion could not remain there and
those orders came from the State Board
of. Harbor Commissioners. The cap
tain went higher than that and said
that he ordered the vessel there and
his authority came from the Governor
of the State-
Ensign John J. Foley is the com
manding officer of the sloop of war
Marion, the naval militia vessel. The
captain, as all officers in the navy hav
ing: a command are called, is a
thorough seaman, having absorbed his
knowledge of a ship forward of the
mainmast and. not in a shore academy.
Added to this qualification he possesses
the diplomacy of the bluff old days of
long ajro. Lord Nelson looking through
the glass with his blind eye that he
might not see the unwelcome orders
of the admiral is Ensign John J.
Foley's example, and he sees no signals
but those he himself hoists aboard the
Marion.

WITH the issue of the Sunday Call of October 30 will be for
mally instituted an interesting featureâ a short story con
test in which a cash prize of $50 .will be awarded each week
to the best Western story submitted by a Western writer. This
contest is instituted for the purpose of encouraging Western writers
by offering for their work a consideration equal to that paid by the
best magazines for stories of similar length, and for the purpose of
bringing young and unknown writers who are doing. strong work
before the notice of the ; reading public. Names will count for
nothing; the inexperienced writer will receive the same considera
tion as the experienced pen. What is wanted are stories that reflect
the peculiar life of California and the West; stories which will be
lecognized abroad as having the distinctive air of the West.
In line with its . established policy of giving the best and
brightest ideas to its readers that money can procure, the Sunday
Call, realizing the value attached to a comic supplement by the chil
dren, will to-morrow begin the publication of a handsome, high
class four-page comic section in colors, in addition to the regular
magazine section.
"The Grafters," Francis Lynde's novel of politics and love, runs
through its fourth and last installment to-morrow. On November
6 will be published complete in one installment, Stephen Conrad's
delightful little sketch of rural life, "The Secoqd Mrs. Jim;"- in
which the second Mrs. Jim demonstrates to the satisfaction of every
one that the trying position of stepmother may possess possibilities
for love and contentment on all sides not popularly ascribed to that
greatly maligned relationship.

The French and Scotch flannels,
lightweight woolens, heavy mercerized
cottons and linens are used extensively
in fashioning the modish waists for
general use. The flannel waists are
trimmed with fancy yokes and cuffs of
taffeta, with bands of Russian 'cross
stitch or Persian embroidery and with
the fancy silk braids. Buttons play no
small part in trimming these garments.
The mercerized cottons may be had in
colors as "well as In the white. When
the material is figured or striped no
additional trimming is desirable. The
coarsely woven white cottonsâ oxfords,
some call themâ may be crossstltched
most effectively. The embroidered
linen waist retains its popularity, for
fine work cannot be imitated with any
degree of success. -
Peau de cygne, ' messaline and soft
taffeta are the silks most frequently
employed in fashioning the separate silk
bodice. These waists "are usually very
elaborate, both in style and in mode
of trinyning.. Hand workâ both em
broidery and laceâ are used extensively
and effectively. Lace forms ve'uy hand
some decoration for. these dainty waists
and J lace collars, lace boleros â¢ and lace
flouncings are much in demand. 1 , Chen

At one of the recent .weddings the
bride carried a prayer book, marked to
open, at the marriage service and from
which she, was to read Â¦.the responses
and follow the service. .The practical
joker was present, of course; for there
was never a wedding at which the
practical joker was not. Just before
the ceremony he slipped the bride's
prayer book into his ; pocket and left
another in its place which he had bor
rowed . fur the occasion. When, the
bride opened it at the' altar she was a
bit surprised and for a moment was
lost in wonder as to what had hap
pened. Then she "caught on," bit her
lips to keep back a smile and bent her
head over the book 'with no evidence
of anything wrong, v
[The practical joker had substituted a
prayer book printed in uerman and the
bride could' read only English. Never
theless, she had, studied the ceremony
carefully and made>the; responses '.at
the proper time/and in the words set
down in the ritual. - ,
To prepare for a rainy day â that
question, although nothing out of the
ordinaryâ is one which many women
ponder over and actually worry, about
more than, what to wear to the opera,
ball or theater. It is, to be sure, a vital
part of women's wardrobe, many ills
being, caused indirectly by carelessness
of dress on the wet and damp days.
The advent of the cravenette is a bless
ing, and although they are not as warm
as thÂ£y should be there are many ways
of overcoming this. Vests of all de
scriptions are on sale, and they are all
becoming to a certain extent.
One great fault of these rain coats Is
that a great majority are altogether too
long, and they become wet and remain
damp while one is wearing them. The
proper length Is just at the Â¦ hem of a
short skirt. One may do very well with
out one*of these coats. There are many
new ideas for rainy weather, and one
is the cravenette suit, which is more
becoming to a majority of women than
the loose affair. They are made with
the tight jacket and short skirt and the
rain has no effect" whatsoever upon
them. The style for sandals, which are
used In place of the high rubber, has
become so popular that -it is a wonder
more women are not ill. They are ab
solutely worthless on a stormy : day and
no protection. Only the storm rubbers
should be worn, and if sandals, are
worn at all it . should , only be in the
summertime. ; V;'^

SOME GOOD RECIPES. |
COPYRIGHT. 1901. BT SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE 8AN FRANCISCO CALL WITH THE NEW YORK EVENING MAIL. {
There is a lack of co-operation in facilitating commerce be
tween the Federal service here and ship owners. Notably is this
the case in the dispatch of mails. Ships are detained beyond sailing
hours by this failure to consult the need of promptness in getting
out of port. In New York a mail clerk is detailed for service on
the dock to receive mail, in order that the sacks may be closed in
time. This enables banks and commission men and exporters to
get their letters and drafts that follow bills of lading on the same
ship that carries the merchandise without delaying it beyond the
sailing hour. "*"
There are many other respects in which the touch of the Fed
eral authority with shipping interests â¢ may be improved, but the
State should not wait for the correction of these mere matters of
administration. It should invite American ships to make this their
home port by relieving them of the heavy State and local taxes by
which they are now punished for flying the American flag. If this
is not done the ships that now make this their home port will be
fewer in number, for they cannot pay their taxes and compete with
foreign ships that have no tax at all. Â»
We ask the attention of the merchants of this city and the
business men of this State to this condition. The prosperous and
successful maritime States do not impose these burdens. Can our
sea-going trade be expected to prosper if it be compelled to bear
them?
THE eyes of the commercial world are turned upon the Pacific
and trade is estimating its future possibilities. No seaport
on either, shore of that ocean has greater interest in the ex-'
pected expansion of its commerce than San Francisco. Â¦ We listen to
enthusiastic speeches on this subject made in our commercial bodies,
and by public men and on public occasions, but enthusiastic expec
tation will not retain for San Francisco the lead 'that she has, nor
maintain it against rivals in the future. â¢â¢;-;.; , . -I'-Yi
This city needs not only ships for deep water trade, but she
needs freer opportunity as a ship owning port, to the end that she
may get full credit for her position as "a maritime city. The laws
of the State are unfriendly to this ambition of its chief city. The
exaction of State and municipal taxes from ships owned and reg
istered here is a relic of primitive times that should be abolished.
The equities of taxation require that benefits should go with bur
dens. This is impossible in the case of ships that are in port only
to discharge and take cargo. They arc not like buildings which
get the constant benefit of police and fire protection, for they are
on deep water nine-tenths of the time, where such protection is im
possible.
The subject of tax reform is coming to the front in California,
and through the efforts of the State Grange is being made an issue
with which politicians and the Legislature must reckon. When it is
ready for consideration in the next Legislature it will be in order
to propose the relief of our deep water shipping from the unneces
sary and unrequited exactions imposed by local taxation.
Ships have to pay for wharf and dock privileges. These rents
have built the -seawall and will build the needed extension of it upon
which the people are to vote at the coming election. Of this no
one complains, but when, in addition, ships that make this their
home port are compelled to pay municipal taxes for sewers and other
municipal purposes of which in the nature of things they make no
use, the exaction is in restraint of trade and an unwise burden upon
commerce. If the tables were turned and the buildings and realty
and personalty of the city were taxed to build the seawall, and ships
were given the use of berths and docks and wharves, rent free,
there would go up a protest from the city taxpayers that would
make a roar in the Legislature. Yet such a system of taxation would
be no more unjust than that to which ships are subjected, for muni
cipal needs of which they can make no use.
Other maritime States are far in advance of this in the mat
ter of taxation, for they exempt ships, while we tax them. - The
result is that but few of the ships that carry our trade make this their
home port. Again, the ships that are, owned here and make this
their home port are American ships under our flag. They have to
compete with foreign ships which pay no State nor municipal tax
here at all. The American ships have also to pay port wages to
their crews, while foreign ships do not pay the wages of this port.
They ship cheaper crews elsewhere, from captain to cabin boy. At
their home port they pay none of the local taxes that American ships
pay here. In these facts may be found some of the reasons for the
decline of American shipping. The local taxes imposed 'upon it
are a heavy fine and penalty for flying the American flag. While
the State is blameworthy in this matter of taxation, it is also true
that Federal burdens are imposed upon American shipping in San
Francisco that are not imposed in New York and other ports on
the Atlantic seaboard. >
MAKE THIS A FREER PORT.

Supreme Court Declares That Two
Sentences Cannot Be Construed
as One Term.
The Supreme Court has brought
sadness to the hearts of the State's
convicts by declaring that two or more
sentences cannot be construed as one
term. This ruling will take away
long-term credits from more than 100
inmates of Sa.n,Quentin and Folsom.
Jamep B. Clifton, one of Warden
Yell's charges, brought the matter to
the attention of the court on a peti
tion for a writ of habeas corpus. He
was sentenced to serve flve j-ears each
on two - convictions of burglary. The
law gives felons fifteen months in
credits on a five-year term and forty
two months in credits on a ten-year
term. If Clifton's two sentences were
held to be one term he would serve a
year less than if he was serving two
five-year terms.
The decision was rendered by Jus
tice Lorigan. Chief Justice Beatty
and Justices McFarland, Shaw, Angel
lotti. Van Dyke and Henshaw directly
concurred- " .. . -
Suit for Permanent Injunction Against
Unions Brought by Proprietor

Boycott tactics resented by the pro

cause of a suit for injunction begun
yesterday- by S. Constantini against
Cooks' Union, Local No. 44, and Walt

spective officers.
The complainant alleges that on Oc
tober 18 he was waited upon by walk
ing delegates of the unions, who in
formed him that if he did not dis
charge the non-union men in. his em
ploy "he would be sorry "for It." He
refused to be dictated to by the labor

they combined and conspired .to coerce
and injure ' him in his 'business. He
complains that pickets are patrolling

the union men, say falsely that Con

With Cruelty â Separations Grant* -
cd by Court,
Lucy Camille Baker, who tried on
Thursday to end her life with an over
dose of morphine, was yesterday sued
for divorce by her husband, Frederick
J. Baker, who charges her with cru
elty. They were married In Oakland
in October, 1902. A year later, he
sj,ys?, she misbehaved and came home
drunk onÂ»> night and struck him in
tr>e face. Since then she has, he says,
been in the habit of staying out at
night and associating with persons, of
bad repute.
A suit. for divorce was brought by
Samuel L. Westcott against Ella' J.
Westcott, whom he married in Nova
Scotia in. 1876, and who deserted him
seven years ago. Their eldest chlid
is 27 years old. â¢
Divorces" were granted by Judge
Hebbard to Josephine Furst from
Adolphus W. Furst for inflde.lity by
Judge Sloss to Amelia. Santa Cruz
from Joaquin Santa Cruz, desertion*
by Judge Graham to Julia B. Spies
from John J. Spies, neglect; by Judge
Troutt to Exquia F. de la Pena from
Stephen R. de la Pena, neglect-
Judge Graham ordered. Thomas
Collins to pay $30 a month and $50
counsel fees to his wife, whom he de
serted shortly, after their marriage
last June. Collins is an employe at
the Mint, earning $4 a day.

CHINESE CHARGES.â Carrie G. Davis of
the Woman's Home Mission yesterday . applied
to the Superior Court for letters of guardian
ship over Sam How Dong and Sam Ah Moy,
Chinese children, aged 12 and S yean respect
ively. Their father lives at Bakersfleld and
the - whereabouts of 7 the - mother Â¦ Is Â¦ unknown.
It Is said that the children desire to attend
the mission school.-. Â¦
â¢But; for the heroic efforts of two po
licemen - and the â¢ members of Truck
Company, No. 5 Launcelot Jackson, an
8-year-bld boy, living at 16 Byington
avenue, would probably have lost his
life yesterday - afternoon by being
buried alive in a sand lot at the corner
of : Ellis and Fillmore streets. â With
three youthful companions, Alvin Lang
of ; 1506 Ellis street,' Sydney Carr of 23
Byington avenue and, Chester Chan, a
Chinese boy living in j the Â¦ same " neigh
borhood, Jackson had been engaged in
digging . a well in I the- lot for . several
days. ; When a depth of j four feet had
been reached the youngsters conceived
the ' idea Â¦ of rigging ; up a derrick with
which. to raise a bucket.
j|| The" boys were proceeding with their
work yesterday in a methodical man
ner, each taking his turn at . the bot
tom . the excavation and filling the
bucket' with sand.; They ... had finally
reached a depth of. about nine feef at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon, when Jack
son, mugh against his will,- went to the
bottom to do his shift. Suddenly one
side of the well caved in and youiM:
Jackson ' was buried \ up to his ; neck It
sand. His three companions; althouiji
greatly frightened, immediately went Â«.o
his rescue, but realizing that i . they
could render little . assistance, as the
sand was dry and kept -piling in upon
Jackson as fast as they; could : remove
it, they hurried off for help and soon re
turned with Patrolmen Gleeson and
O'Shaughnessy. 7
The policemen labored diligently for
several . minutes and then summoned
Truck 5, the members of which turned
to the. work of rescue with; a will and
after a hard struggle managed to extri
cate young Jackson from; his perilous
position. They hurried him . to the
Emergency Hospital, where an exam
ination showed that the boy was not
injured. While .the. firemen were en
deavoring ; to rescue Jackson a large
crowd gathered ( about the scene and
cheered the truckmen in their difficult
task" and greeted ' the rescuers with a
mighty uproar when success rewarded
their efforts.

Ye who know Gertrude Atherton's
books and know her not, list ye!
Fascinating, blond, blue-wyed, blue
eowned. with a soft sweep of
whit* throat and shoulders, natural,
interested, quick of grasp, devoid of
pose, warm Â«nd womanly is Gertrude
Atherton as we met last night, some
400 of us Sequoians. hand to hand in
the ivory and gt>ld ballroom at the St.
Francis.
At the fall of twilight the dinner
uas on. the dinner given to the fam
ous Californlan by the directors of the
club.
Seated with a personal fitness
wrought out by President Charles S.
Aiken, the following guests dined
with our fair compatriot:
Mr. rjjd Mrs. Asnton Stevens.. Mr. and Mrs.

Â¥- Hi--. Â¥/â¢ and Mr " Fr Â»nk D*erfng and Charles
k. Held.
Xow. that dinner was a joy, for
know ye all that there wasn't a
speech, nay. nor a toastf save those
that sprang to the lips of neighbors.
And they, so 'tis said, were worth the
hearing. Most Sequoia toasts are.
Among; those few who sent regrets
were Bailey Millard, George Hamlin
Fitch and Lorenzo Sosso. After a din
ner whose digestion was not arrested
by terrorizing thought of "being call
ed upon," a reception was held, with
the brilliant novelist the lodestar. The
following ladies received the guests,
all of whom met the honored guest,
and for each she had a word of greet
ing: Mrs. Reginald Knight Smith,
Mrs. Alice Prescott, Miss Millicent
CosgTave, Miss Ethel Moore and Mrs.
E. S. Simpson.
At no function of the year were so
rrany interesting people gathered, and
let it be cried out from the housetops
that there were more charming men
there last nightâ men who do thingsâ
than at any social function In a coon's
age.
Now, that's society! Women, and
pretty women, are always with us, but
many men who are clever and interest-
Ing and worth while usually fight shy
of social affairs. But they were there
in bunches last night As to the wom
en, they were fair to look upon and
gowned in fetching fashion. There was
Mrs. Elizabeth Gerberding in a clinging
black velvet gown, showing a throat
encircled with pearls and a red rose
wreath in her hair; Mrs. B. F. Xorris
in a stunning black gown. Miss Elsie
Sperry in a picturesque frock with a !
Gainsborough hat, pretty Marie Wells
in a flame-colored gown and hat. Miss
Frances Jolliffe in a diaphanous white
frock. Miss Ednah Robinson Id a splen
did lace robe, with autumn leaves in
her hair; Mrs. Frank Deering in a gray
gown and chinchilla hat and muff. But
why go on, for the list grows apace?
Among those who gathered to do
honor to Mrs. Atherton were:
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Foster Dutton, Mr. and
Mrs. Graven Dutton. Judcre and Mrs. Ralph
K. Harrison. Mrs. T. M. Onnent, Miss Anna
Strunsky. Dr. Ftrunaky. Dr. Milicent Cossrave.

Miss Eva Withrow, John M. Gamble, Mr. and

affairs of the oarsmen and with adopt
ing tricky methods to maintain them
selves In power.
Meetings have been held by the row
ing men at which the conduct. of the
board of managers of the Pacific Asso
ciation has been condemned, arid the
oarsmen have discussed the question
of retiring from the association' and
forming an organization of rowing
clubs only.
. W. B. Hinchman, the president of

many years secretary of the Alameda
Boat Club, â¢ has withdrawn from the

that several yachtsmen will seek quar

the current runs through, the new Bel

short period of slack water is left for
the boats to pass in at the entrance.

AT THE LAST
JINKS OF '04
This week one or two significant
changes, which will probably be per
manent, have taken place. R. A.
Thompson, who has been playing
tackle, was put back into his old posi
tion of Tight guard a few days ago. He
was an efficient tackle, but it is thought
he will be more valuable in his former
place, where his weight and experience
will be of assistance toan inexperienced
center such as the cardinal will have.
Shields is playing "steadily at his old
position of left tackle. C. E. Hyde, who
was out of the game -for two week*
with a bad knee, is playing again. He
is making the strongest race for the
contested center rush position.
The coaches have devoted consider
able time this week to trying out all
available punting material. Dole, Sprott
and Trowbridge have made the best
showing in this feature. The former
two show about equal ability, and It is
yet doubtful which one will be depend
ed upon for kicking in the big game.
Should both of them receive Injuries
sufficient to put them out of the con
test Trowbridge will be a strong man
to fall back upon.
Scrimmage work between the two
squads opened early. in the week, with
general lack of spirit and dash, but im
proved steadily during the last few
days. As a rule the second eleven has
made a better showing than its more
experienced opponent. .The varsity has
scored each afternoon, but only after a
hard struggle. Thursday's practice
showed a marked Improvement in the
first team's interference, which had
been poorly organized up to that time.
This improvement is attributed to the
night signal practice in the gymnasium,
a feature of training - introduced by
Coach Lanagan Wednesday. A half
hour after dinner will be devoted to
this Indoor work every day henceforth.
This system was employed last year
with great" success.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 28.â
With the Intercollegiate championship
game only two weeks off, the Stanford
gridiron squad is scarcely as efficient as
should be expected so late in the sea
son. Most of the rudimentary points
of the game the men have mastered
well, but in speed at advancing the ball
and cleverness at defense the varsity
team has not responded to its coaching
as readily as it should.
It is a part of Coach Lanagan's pol
icy to not actually organize his varsity
eleven until a few days before the final
game. As a consequence the players
are still being shifted back and forth
between first and second squads, and
the so-called varsity team is seldom the
same as on the previous day. Judgment
of the team's strength Is thus rendered
uncertain.
At ends, Henry, Howard. Elliott,
Oliver and Caminetti will all get a
chance. Howard played tackle on last
year's varsity and Oliver is a second
eleven man.
Heine Heitmuller and Jim Force at
tackles are both sure of their positions,
as there is no one who can compete
Â¦silth them. They have improved all
season.
The fight for quarter is still more in
teresting. Belknap, the famous little
quarter, who played on the Dartmouth
te&m that defeated Harward 9-0 in
1900 and again in 1901. is on the field
and Kittrelle and Booth both have to
hustle. Bclknap's interference is su
perb and his generalship seldom faul
ty. 'Whitman, a sophomore, is making
these men fight hard also. His work
in the game with Oregon raised him a
notch ii. the fight.
Captain Stroud will hold down the
center position with Stern. Gray and
Haffey as guards. Stern is the heav
iest man on the line and has great en
durance. It is probable that Gray and
Haffey will divide up one guard posi
tion.
Back of the line are twelve men, none
of â¢whom can be sure of a place and all
of whom are likely to play. At full.
Lasater and Boynton have distanced
all competitors. Both men are fierce on
bucks. Lasater has a fine hurdling
habit which makes great gains, but
which lays him out quickly. Boynton
5s as fierce in his center drives and
keeps his feet better than his competi
tor. Both men have been good for five,
ten and even fifteen yards through any
team against which the blue and gold
has lined up this year.
. At halfback California has six re
liable men who can be counted on.. Of
these Sperry. the big freshman, is the
most reliable. He is the heaviest of
the six and has more endurance. Kern
Is fast on end runs, as is Graves, but
both men will not last Ions. White
and Mead are both good players. Mead
is especially strong in backing up the
line and running interference, and
White's long suit is * uckin;, through
tackle or center. Olie Snedigar is on
the field again and in condition and it
eeems there is nothing the big half
can't do. His last two nights' practice
on the squad has proved how irresist
ible his bucks and end runs are. There
is little doubt that all six of these men
will play seme time at half in the big
game.
Dr. Frank Simpson, who played
tackle on the *96 and '97 varsity and
â¢who coached the plucky little team
that defeated Stanford 2-0 in 1901, is
helping Hopper on the field. He is
giving his attention to the tackle po
eition. With Greisburg working at
center and guards, Kerfoot taking
care of the quarter position and Mini
and Hopper at work on the ends and
backs, the blue and gold has the larg
est board of coaches it has had in the
history of football.
This -e the reason so large a number
of good individual players has been
developed at Berkeley this year and
:*itb such efficient team wprk.
BERKELEY. Oct. 28. â From pres
ent indications it Eeems the team that
-will represent the blue and gold
against the cardinal on November 12
will consist of twenty-two or three
men instead of eleven.' Coach Hop
per has developed that number of
men and it is certain he will spare no
men in the fray, as he has plenty and
to spare. Berkeley's tactics in the
big game this year will be to play
hard and fast and use all their men
if necessary.

game resulted in an easy victory, for
Mission: The score was IS to 0. La.Â«t
week the same teams -played a no
score game. The teams were more
evenly matched than the score would
Indicate. Mission, besides outplaying
Lcwell. had al! the luck; Lowell
fumbled constantly and Mission nearly
always got the ball.
'Captain Cerf of Lowell was the only
man on his team who did much. He
was given the ball on almost every
play and at first gained his yards. He
soon got tired and with him used up
it was easy for Mission. Terrlll was
the- star of - the Mission team and
gained most of thsir ground. La Coste
also did good work and kicked all
three goals. Mission "scored once in

The Supervisors' joint Committee on
Police and Judiciary concluded Its in
quiry yesterday into charges made by
Dominick Shannon ag&tnst the conduct
of coursing at Ingleside Coursing Park.
David Dillon, former director of the
coursing, association, said the dogs
could be tampered with and the man
agement not know ft. Dillon said he
had left the association because of
Shannon's way of running things to
suit himself when he was manager.
Jerry O'Shea. who was questioning
Dillon, stated he wanted to go into the
affairs of the park running back ten
years in order to show that "Shannon
was not the angel he represented him
self to" be."
Thomas Foley said he had never seen
anything wrong at the park. 1 ..
J. A. Welch, a former field steward,
said whenever there was the least sus
picion of dogs being drugged bets- were
declared off- and the- offenders were
summarily dealt .with, two of them
having been ruled '.off for life. In re-'
sponse to Shannon's question, Welch
said he had heard Chief Field Steward
Julian once say he had found, "dope"
pills in O'Shea's kennels. Welch . also
said he had seen dogs staggering about
the field, but did not know from" what
cause. " ; " Â¦* â¢'"' '
Thomas' Murphy said he had a sus
picion dogs were "doped/'but had never
seen it done." He had often found fault
with the ruling of the Judges. He had
never seen women in | the'betting* ring.
Murphy admitted he had told Shannon
it was a shame the. way the dogs were
run and that . his - Â¦Â¦ was _â¢Â¦ being
taken away from him. Murphy said he
had seen ; dogs die, but not : In a ' short
course, and that many peopled had be
seeched, Shannon" to .put a- stop to," the
"doping" of ' dogs. Shannon said, that
there" wasVmqre "doping** in J the/ last
year than ever before. / '
"I would'. like' .to haverMr. Shannon
put on the stand," said O'Shea, Vhe",be^
ing the . father of. coursing.' "V
. "I. couldn't : afford *tq father . your
coursing," said Shannon. ...
â¢ Responding to - O'Shea's '; questions,
Shannon said: ' ". .. ' " >- .

as Shannon had alleged, ,Â¦ and these two
had died from broken necks. O'Shea
tried to prove. that two of Shannon's
dogs had died,- but Shannon said they
died after he had sold them to others.
The committee Questioned J. M.
Leary, manager of. the Vienna Model
bakery, as to Samuel Raguet's charge
that he had been dismissed from his
place as a ...waiter in the. restaurant be
cause he had . testified against the
coursing park. Leary said Raguet was
discharged because the other, waiters
talked with" him on the subject and
on that account , were inattentive to
their duties.. No .influence had been
brought by the coursing people. to com
pel Raguet's dismissal, Leary said.
; At ". this point Shannon and O'Shea
submitted their cases. Shannon said
he "had proven that things were being
dishonestly conducted at the park.
O'Shea said Shannon had not proved
his charges and' was, actuated by per
sonal SPite. Thejcommlttee took , the
matter under advisement.
Petitions signed , by a large number of
property owners ,and residents in the
vicinity of the coursing park" were filed
asking that the park be closed on the.
ground that it was a menace and a
nuisance. . ;

CHICAGO. Oct. 23.â A fair sized
crowd was attracted to-day to Worth
track. The feature event, the fifth
race, a seven-furlong purse affair, was
taken by Floral King, second choice
at 6 to 5, which" beat~the favorite. Big
Ben, rather easily. . There were but
four starters and Big Ben was held at
1 to 10 in the betting. The field ran
well bunched all the way until the final
quarter, where Floral King drew away
and won by^half a length.
JAMAICA, Oct.' 28.â Irish Witch,
winner of the second race! did not rank
as a" stake mare during 'the summer
season, j but to-day she defeated three
that did. St. Valentine, Damon and
Ocea'n Tide, .'all. three of which, at the
height of the season, were competing
for prizes -many times-more -valuable
than the byernfghtlevents- which their
owners areglad to run them in.
Damon. made the running, but failed_
to stay the mile ajid the issue was be
tweenvlrish- -Witch- and St. -Valentine.
The 'latter, made his reappearance after
several weeks. ' Irish Witch is owned
by Joseph E. Seagram, owner of Scotch
Plume 'and Cloten, ; both "of whom have
won'at long odds at this meeting.
The only stake on to-day's . card was
the Sayville, at selling allowances.
There was much interest felt in the
perf omiance of Canteen, . as her late
defeat was so complete that few felt
it was her' real form. Apparently It
was, for she ran 'much the same sort
of a race to-day. She was fourth in a
five-horse race. ]The 60 to 1 shot. Pal
ette, made the running for several fur
longs, when Champlain, which was sec
ond, took the lead and won cleverly,
although Garnish, which was third,
was closing fast. Canteen was fourth.

Lynch beat out a bunt. It was a full

Joe Gans* friends are betting on him;
wjsiclx "is taken as -an indication tha{
the lightwelghi champion Is sure of ; hi* '
ability to mate' the "required Weight
tvfcSn he meets Brttt on Monday, night:
The pressure, of : the , G&ns " mbiey - last
ripht snde'hliaan'ito 10 -choice in
the Â¦ betting. The -price will be well
spttled to-nigbC as [there is a lot of
money to be bet on each man.'
The Question which is being eagerly
debated is: "Will i * make the
weight and fce etrong?* ' Â¦ 'Â¦ j . .!
M onager Willie Brttt . said last night ;
â¢ If I am not satisfied on Sunday that
G.ics can make the weight I will'In
Â£ st ; on hit present forfeit of $2500 being
increased to $5000 "or $7500. If he ap
pears at tie .LngEjde on Monday night
ovei -eight it will depend on our judg
ment whether we will flght him or not:
Tfce statement that Jimmy would fight
him if he weighed 140 pounds was un
s. thoriied by us. We want to fight
Gans. but this is a business proposi
ticm and we '.rill insist on our rigffts."
Gans is still striving hard to make
the required weight. He has practically
cut out all gymnasium work and spends
most cf his time hitting the high places
of Marin. Many spectators visited the
camp yesterday with the expectation ml
seeing him box. but aU'were sorely dis
appointed. Battling Neison and Otto
Kropf of Milwaukee were among ,the
number. Nelson thinks Britt will win
inside of fifteen rounds.
Joe returned from a ten-mile run at 4
o'clock, perspiring freely but breathing
eably and showing no signs of fatigue.
He repaired to his room and was given
a brisk nibdown. He looks as if every
ounce of superfluous flesh had been
worked off, t>ut still does not look
drawn. As Herford was rubbing down
his protege the champion said, "Oh,
hurry bc. Al; don't you smell the
chicken?" Al replied. "You're, not hun
gry, are you. Joe?" and the dusky boy
replied, "Ain't hungry! Well, you Just
run these reads a few miles and see."
After the rubdown Herford an
nounced that Joe weighed 136 pounds.
Although the battle is but three days
off the weight problem does not seem
to bother Gans. his trainer or his man
ager. The Â«ise ones are wondering how
the dusky champion is going to make
it, but the colored boy smiles and says,
'"Witch ine."
Jjt. T. A. Rottanri and Dr. Max
Magnus visited Jimxay Britt's training ;
quarters at Croll's Gardens in Alameda
yesterday and made a careful and com
plete medical examination of the little :
fighter. They found him in perfect con
dition. Dr. Rottanzi was enthusiastic
in his admiration of the Britt physique.
Tlie physicians watched Jimmy go
through his stunts in the gymnasium
and pronounced him a speed marveL
Referee Eddie Graney also called en
Eritt and had a thorough understand
ing with him regarding the manner in
m'hich the boxers are to conduct them
stlvea during the battle. Britt agreed
to break clean and protect himself In
the clinches. Joe Gans has. agreed to
do likewise so there is little possibility
of a misunderstanding on this score
when the fighters clash. .
Arsocg the other guests at the Britt
camp yesterday were James Coffroth,
Teddy Murphy, manager of Battling
Nelson, William Broderick, Harry Lord,
a BakersSeld sporting man who is go
ing to wager a sum on Jimmy's
chances, Man&ger and Brother Willie
Eritt and Colonel Martin Brady. The
latter escorted a delegation of ladies,
Tho displayed as much interest " in
Jimmy as if he were a lone man at a
summer resort. Britt went through an
hour's work in the gymnasium for the
estertainment of the ladles and the
largre crowd of other admirers of the
white champion. Wlien he finished his
pjfternoon exercising he weighed 134
Speaking of hi* brother's "condition.
Manager Billy Britt said: "Jimmy has
never been in better fettle in his. life.
There Is not that attenuated appear*
ance about him that was noticeable
when he was in training for some of ,
bis former fights. He is bubbling over ;
with energy and is as frisky as a
panther. He has met with no accident
nor injury in his training and is as fit
as science and systematic . care can
make him. We are not taking any
stock tn the reports that Gans is ex
leriencing difficulty In making 123
pounds. They are given out for the
purpose of influencing betting and
should be assimilated with plenty of
sa!t- M

BRIEF CITY NEWS.
The decision of the Supreme Court
prevents the placing of the charter
amendments on the ballot at the elec
tion of November 8 next, because two
years have not elapsed since the last
submission of amendments on Decem
ber 4, 1902. Rohcovleri is desirous of
haying the proposals voted on so they
may, if adopted, be ratified by the
Legislature. Even if immediate action
were taken by the Supervisors the
amendments could not be so ratified
until. the latter part of January owing
to the time required for publication and
other proceedings.
"I herewith , transmit to you a copy
of the text of the decision of the Su
preme Court in the case of the charter
amendments and respectfully request
that you refer the same to the Joint
committee on school amendments in
order that the Board of Supervisors
may take action at next Monday's ses
sion, looking toward an early.submis
sion of the proposed school amend
ments to the suffrages of the electors
of this city and county."
Alfred Roncovieri, president of tho
Board of Education,- yesterday sent a
communication to the Board of Super
visors asking: that immediate action be
taken on the petitions signed by more
than 30,000 voters r that the proposed
charter amendmenta affecting the pub
lic school department be submitted at
an early date. The communication
says:
Roncovieri Wants School Board Char
ter Amendments Submitted.
ASKS SUPERVISORS TO ACT,
The appointment of George Tuthlll as
starting judge by the California Jockey
Club was unquestionably an excellent
move. George is a thorough horseman
and will be able to observe many little
things which escape the starter.
Thomas H. Williams, president of the
California' Jockey Club, who has been
absent on a business trip East for some
weeks, is e'xpected home tq-morow.
Fred Leppert,- for several years with
Bookmaker Fred Cook, is due here to
morrow, along V'ith other Chicago pen
cllers.
Illilouon, the. useful plater purchased
by J. J. Ferguson from Billy Randall
at the "close" of the Portland meeting,
will not race the cqmlng ' season for
most excusable reasons. The gelding
was one of a batch of horses that ar
rived by steamer from Seattle yester
day morning, and proved a poor sailor.
He was taken to an Oakland livery
stable in a precarious condition, dying
a few hours later.
Good racing weather in the Eastern
country, with many tracks still open
for business, has contributed to making
turfmen late in heading toward the
coast this season. The "standing room
only" sign! has not been exhibited at
Oakland as yet, but there are more
than 300 horses on the ground and the
unoccupied stalls have all been spoken
for. A couple of carloads are due to
arrive this morning from Kansas 'City.
It does not pay always to make light
of an injury, even though it may ap
pear trivial at the time. One week ago
to-day Superintendent "Bill" Fieldwick
of the track across the bay had a gash
cut in one of his legs by^ an unruly
horse, and tried some surgical treat
ment on the wound. Bill hobbled
around for a day or two, but is- now In
the hospital threatened with blood-poi
soning, and may be compelled; to stay
on the shelf for a month or more.
"Bill" Fieldwlck, Superintendent of
Oakland Track Suffering From
, Ugly Gash on Leg.
MANX STABIiES ARE DUE
TO ARRIVE HERE SOON
Mr. Ldvemash's address was warmly
applauded by all. for his words had
awakened gentle recollections and had
stimulated hope.
In the spirit of such hallowed association-".
my friends, I greet you. and thank you fcr
the Invitation you have extended me and fcr
the pleasure I experience in meeting you to
night. Â¦ o .
I feel here to-night as I fancy I should feel
If I had passed out of .the noise and heat and
commotion of a great city's streets and into
the bleared vale which moved the Irish poet- to
ene of his sweetest songs â that happy vale
where the bright waters meet; that sweet re
treat where smiling nature has shed o'er tlw
scene her purest of crystal and brightest of
green. Invoking thy name, delightful gem of
Wlcklow â though far away, yet to our affec
tions near â Sweet Vale of Avoca. let our hearts
to-night, like thy waters, be mingled tn pejtce!
And whether my Invocation awakens fond
recollections of the, scene itself, or but the as
sociations which the charm of Irish melody
has clustered around the name, and whether
heard by Irishmen or by their descendants
who have not seen the land of their fathers, it
will not fall. Irrland'9 children love her with
a h)ly passion. They love her for her
great sorrows; they love her for her noble for
titude, her steadfast faith and deathless hope.
But. permeatirg and exalting all is their love
for Ireland's beauty. And by song and legend
and story Ireland's sons and daughters have
captivated the fancy of their children born in
other lands.
A political campaign 13 a liberal education
lor a candidate. la the weeks preceding an
election there Is revealed to him more of thÂ»
Innermost life of his fellow citizens, of their
true attitude toward government, of conditions
of race and circumstances of environment (at
other times unnoted) which move them In thetr
allegiance to principles and parties than could
be gathered from the experience of an equal
number of years of active business or profes
sional occupation. In the heat of partisan con
tention, the spite and malice often engendered
by keen rivalry, the ardor of friendship, the
selfish-jess cf place hunting:. . the disinterested
devotion of many to policies that make for the
general good, the sordid fear of others lest a
situation which makes for the aggrandizement
of themselves at the cost of the common good
may aufTer change to thetr advantage, and in
countless other aspects presented only In the
melee of political agitation men throw off the
masks they wear in seasons of complacence
and reserve.
Congressmen Edward "J. Livernash
and William J. Wynn spoke last even-
Ing at a meeting in their honor in
Knights of the Red Branch Hall un
der the auspices of Division No. 5.
Ancient Order of Hibernians. Mr.
Livernash delivered the principal
speech of the evening, saying in part:

Cabmen all along the street stood by
their vehicles, looking . longingly at
tnany_ of those who on former occa
sions were good fares, but who now
cared only to be whirled about on the
new road. There was a decided falling
oft also in the restaurants among
after-theater diners.
NEW YORK, Oct. 28.â None of the
surface car lines showed an appre
ciable diminution In traffic as a result
of the competition with the subway,
which opened for public service at. 7
o'clock last evening.
At the intersection in Herald Square
of the Broadway, Sixth-avenue and
Thirty- fourth street lines (the busiest
place in New York, there seemed to
be no decrease in patronage, so far as
the conductors and transfermen could
Judge. This" was true also at Forty
second street and Broadway.
-On the "L" lines, however, traffic was
noticeably lighter. The theater-going
crowd from Brooklyn that nightly jams
the Park-place station of the Sixth
avenue line was not so large, and there
were few strap hangers In the trains
bound uptown. Hundreds of Brook
lyn theater-goers who travel In the up
town on the "L," took the subway route
home.
Mrs. Postley said that Miss Dolbeer
seemed to be In good health when shÂ«
saw her in New York and that Miss
Dolbeer said she had so arranged her
business affairs that she could remain
away for two years if she enjoyed the
trip.
She declared that with the excep
tion of the time Miss Dolbeer was in
Europe she had been her intimate
friend and companion and that Miss
Dolbeer had never shown any signs of
being insane or irrational.
NEW YORK, Oct. 23.â Mrs. Sterling
Postley, for years the schoolmate and
Intimate friend of Bertha M. Dolbeer,
the younif California woman who com
mitted suicide at the Waldorf-Astoria
last January, was the only witness at
the hearing: to-day on the will of Miss
Dolbeer. Mrs. Postley Is a resident of

NEW YORK. Oct. 28.â With the fears of a
rupture between liu*sia and Great Britain re
lieved, stocks scored a sharp recovery to-day.
Tfaere wss an astertioa of the recovered bull
control cl the market and excursions, were
made into the Ust to develop new points of
strength. These efforts met with success. The
striklni feature of the market, however, m-as
list decline in Interest at the higher levels
and the lapse into actual dullness at times.
The market was the smallest of the week. The
ocnÂ«*<jueacc was a supposition that belated
fhcrts are largely responsible for the ruÂ»h to
buy at the opening and the epurt in prices
fct that time. The inference is drawn that
yesterday's "bux?" has had the effect of in
clining largÂ« ep*fulatix-e forces to refrain from
turtber heavy ctwratlons for a time. In the
Â«arij- deallnec L'nion Pacific maintained well
its recent prominence in the market, the tm
peijins lactor being the definite decision on
the rart of the Oregon Short Line directors to
avail themeclve* of the privilege under the
tocrtgsge to retire the participating bond*
at VTZ'f. In unite of all official disclaimers
tb* .â¢;.. j:k;.\ v element *eee in this a certain
Indication that the Northern Securities settle
rr.ent Is being worked out to extend the com
mnnity of interest In the transcontinental
neld. - Official disclaimers of the reported ab
*cirrtion for control by L'nion Pacific or Chi
c*;.r, Greet Western stock were treated with
tfte same *keptk-iÂ«u. The renewed rtrength of
Unlie-a States Steel preferred wbjs as effective
as Â£.n>-thiaÂ» in <hÂ«? day's market In rÂ»Â»torlflg
speculative cocfiJeno*. as the heaviaess of the
Â«ee! eecuritles may tx? eaid almort to beye
f>fcar<?d Â» ith th# wÂ«r scarÂ« as a nuin of the
week's break in the market. The rise In
Amalgamated Â» .'1 ; ;*r and in Eucar was asso
ciated with the favorable trade reports from
the Industries Â»ith which thoÂ«> companies are
concerned. The Canadian Pacific group was
notably buoyant, but no sews was disclosed to
account for It.
The situation in the money market was a
contrifcutiDE cause to the facility with which ;
stocks recovered. The considerable receipts on '
b&ia&ce from the interior on the regular ex
port movement was gratifying to the specula
tive element. Chicago advices pointed to this
an a lull In the interior demand rather than
an end of the mox'ement. The loss by the sub
treaeury operation* and Thursday's geld ex
port wts thus reduced to small proportions.
The decrease in the foreign tension afforded
ecm# relief here to the exchange market and
no further engagements were made of gold for
expprt to-morrow, as had been ' anticipated.
Money on call was offered down during the
day from 2V4 p*r cent to below 2 per cent.
The occasional fluctuations ot the market
rmvc way to a recovery of final dealings, and
the closing was firm and generally at the best
jirioes.
Bonos were f.rm. Total sales, par value,
$6,205,000.
United States bondf were unchanged on call.

Fainily Retail Market.
as usual on ..Friday,. but. there was a good In
quiry* for Grapes in crates and Apples for ex
port to Honolulu on the steamer Alameda, cut
to-day.--- Apples were in liberal, supply "and
easy.^partlcularlf for common , offerings, which
were steadily accumulating. Some extra fancy
Spltzenbergs from Humboldt were firmly held
at prices ranging from $1 50 to $1 73 per box,
but met. with very slow gale at those figures.
A steamer arrived late In the day from Hum
boldt. with 2400 boxes of assorted stock." and
several cars of Oregon fruit were reported
close at .hand. The ft market- was overloaded
with " poor Quinces. : which bad a â¢ depressing
effect on the sale of good fruit. Figs, arrived
freely and. sold. at a wide range as . to quality
and size of box. .' Otherwise there was nothing
new to report in tree fruits. Grapes .In small

. In this Instance the Supervisors have
already, fixed the 'number and salary,
having included in the last budget an
item of &000 for five extra deputies in
the Recorder's office. The budget was
signed Â¦ by the Mayor. .
Judge Sloss took the case under sub
mission and his ruling will involve the
manner of appointment of deputies in
all of the county offices.
to audit his September salary warrant
as deputy in the County Recorder's of
fice. Bellemans and four other depu
ties were employed by the Recorder
without having first been recommended
through the Board of Supervisors by
the Mayor in accordance with section
35, article 16, of the charter. Mr. Roche
represented the applicant and "W. H.
Cobb appeared for the Auditor.
On the admitted statement of facts
it was shown that the Auditor had
complied with the provision of the
charter by applying to the Mayor for
the appointment of the^ deputies and
the Mayor had made the required In
vestigation as to their necessity, but
had refused to recommend their ap
pointment. Roche contended that the
charter provision was void because it
empowered a municipal officer to have
authority in the county government.
He also maintained that if this conclu
sion was gocd, section 5 of the same
article would be void, as It provides
that county officers shall make no ap
pointments except as provided In the
charter. With these two provisions
knocked out dependence, would be
placed in the county government's law
and the county officers could appoint
their own deputies after the Super
visors have fixed their number and
compensation.
The constitutionality of two provi
sions of the charter was attacked yes
terday In Judge Sloss* court and if the
points made by Attorney Theo J.
Roche are held to be good, the power of
tfc* Mayor to recommend appointments
for county offices will be abrogated.
. The hearing was upon the application
of Paul Bellemans for a writ of habeas

the bronze statue representing Victory

NOW DISPUTED
Great hardships in the interest of the
public health are often : inflicted . by; the
medical department ,of - the 1 United
States Immigration Bureau upon aliens
seeking to settle r in " Calif ornlaV "The
bureau yesterday prevented the reunion
of a man with his wife and; caused the
separation of a mother from ; her; son.
T. Harada, a Japanese engaged in the
sale of Oriental "curios in -Los Angeles,
came' to this city to. meet, his wife and
six-year-old son wtio ; 'Â¦" arrived' 1 on the
steamship Doric last Monday. He was
doing a good business and intended liv
ing in California with his family for
the remainder of his days. - But / the
quarantine officials discovered that the
woman .) was suffering, from trachoma,
a contagious disease of the eyes, and
therefore she/ was denied a landing.
The husband' was permitted to take
the boy home with him and the mother
will be sent back to Japan until her
eye disease shall be ) cured, when , she
will be ajlowed to enter this. country.
United States Inspector D. J. Griffiths
and Japanese . Interpreter H: A. S.
Persch filed their report on the matter
yesterday. : ' ,
other Interesting arrivals was
Miss Okamura, a handsome Japanese
lass of . 17 years. She told Inspector
Griffiths that she came to marry^S#lJiro
Shibuyo, editor and manager of - the
Rafu Shinfo, or the Los Angeles Dally
News. Mr. Shibuyo was ' sent for and
denied that he was to be married to
the young lady. He said that she was
a student, belonging to a good family
and ? connected ! with ? his own -socially
and that : she came to this country to
finish - her * studies. \ She'; came In his
care, he added, 1 but he; had :no intention
of marrying her. " As '. the editpr^enjoys
a" good v reputation he was -allowed to
take his 'repudiated' fiancee _to; Los An
geles. " v r
. E. C. Harrison, appointed to appraise
the Inheritance. tax, defended. the cita
tion and yielded to Sutro's contention
for the regular five days' notice.
Judge Coffey stated pointedly :that
Douglas was a "customer of the bank,
and he was succeeded by, the Douglas
estate, iwhlch Is now in this probate
court, and therefore the court' had : the
privileges of the customer. The mat
ter was as . important, he said, to ' thÂ«Â»
State of California as it was to the
bank, which is a creature of the State.
The $30,000 was due to the State and
would have to be paid or some onV
would suffer. The! Judge intimated
that the' County Treasurer had not
been in a hurry to take the matter up
until the court suggested ! that . : \ the
sum might come out of the Treasurer's
bond. And, too, Judge Coffey. criticized
the fact that neither the State nor the
Treasurer was represented at yester
.day's proceedings, leaving the court in
the nature of a prosecutor. - >
Douglas' estatci consisting of securi
ties, was on deposit at the Wells : Fargo
Bank at the time of his death, and Mr.
King was one of the appraisers ' ap
pointed by the court to fix its value.
He did not act," but the other apprais
ers reported the property to be worth
more than $614,000. This inventory was
withdrawn and Mr. King was named
as one of the reappraisers, , but report
ed, with the others, that no estate had
been submitted to them for appraise
ment. Then it was discovered that the
heirs had caused the .removal" of the
estate to Nevada, ostensibly V for the
purpose' of evading the payment of
$30,000 inheritance tax to the State. of
California. - . .
Mr. Sutro suggested , that the proper
â¢proceeding would be to send a personal
representative of the State to Nevada
to recover ' the property, or at | least to
cite the persons there interested to
state its value instead of calling upon
the bank for the information.
An interesting half-hour yesterday
afternoon in Judge Coffey's court was
devoted to the return on the citation
for the appearance of President Homer
S. King and Cashier Frederick L. Lip
man of the Wells-Fargo Bank to ex
plain why they refused to give infor
mation regarding the value of the es
tate of J. M. Douglas. : Mr. King was
not in court, but Mr. Lipraan was pres
ent with his attorney, Alfred Sutro,
who opposed the proceedings and suc
ceeded in staying the examination on
the ground that the required five days'
notice had not been given in the cita
tion. Then another citation' was is
sued, returnable next Friday.
Mr. Sutro said that" the matter was
an important one for the bank, which
did not want to divulge the business
uf its depositors; but he said that if the
officials were properly brought into
court they tfould willingly give the de
sired information.

adopted.' :\ . - x - Â¦
There were present President Spreck
els and Commissioners ' Cummlrigs and
Sullivan. The : discussion ] on automo
biles was brought about mainly by: the
case* of Cuyler Lee, who has j>t late
given .: considerable /; annoyance to the
commission through his apparent utter
disregard of certain rules of the ; board.
Lee was before the board for a renewal
of his license. -He ; said he lost i his - li
cense and insisted' that he had ' ad
dressed several letters to the secretary
of the board. asking for a. renewal, but
had failed to : receive a response.
Notwithstanding that he ' had no li
cense, Lee admitted yesterday \ that he
had â¢ been ; riding through g Golden
Gate Park for several months until last
Sunday, when he was placed under ar
rest. It is . not j th& first \ ttnie^ Lee has
been, in trouble;'over his infraction* of
the. park rules, and the Commissioners
were r disposed to withhold his license on
this ground. They, however, I finally
took his case under advisement, but
not. until President Spreckels had given
utterance * to .'some, severe criticism
about the; way many of the San Fran
cisco au tomobllista are openly violating
the rules adopted for the protection of
life, in^the" park. Although "addressing
Lee it was apparent that the president
Intended that, his remarks should be
broad- in their application and act as a
warning to . others who have !been' ig
noring the commission in its plan , to
safeguard the public at large against
accidents In Golden Gate Park Com
missioners Cummings and Sullivan ex
pressed themselves as in accord with
President Spreckels. ,
During the discussion President
Spreckels stated that he had been in
formed by reliable persons that a num
ber? of proprietors of automobiles had
been accumulating park permits" and
giving them." to unlicensed patrons
whenever * the . latter rented . a machine
with a . view of taking a ' ride through
the. park. The. Commissioners decided
that hereafter, applicants for "licenses
will have to ; furnish 'the. secretary ; of
the board .with their photograph, which
will " be attached to" the back of their
permits', as? a * means \ of identification.*
The secretary was instructed to request
the police' to stop. all automobilists en
terlngtthe, park during the next-, thirty
days I and compel V them^. to show 'their
licenses. It, was 'also decreed by the
board that hereafter all applicants for
permits mtist call on the secretary of
the commission for, them.
The Park Commissioners held a meet
ing yesterday afternoon in the offices
of A. B. Spreckels and devoted consid
erable time to a general discussion' of
new rules for. the governing of auto
mobilists within the confines of the
pleasure resort. Â¦
