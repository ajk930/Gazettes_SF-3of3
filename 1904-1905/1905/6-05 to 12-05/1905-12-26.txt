LONDON, Dec. 25.- â The correspondent of the Daily Telegraph at St/ Petersburg telegraphs : Â«'At
an;; early hour this morning the casualties at Moscow were estimated at .5000 killed arid 14,000
wounded, with the fighting still proceeding. The inhabitants of Moscow have been forbidden to
leave their dwellings after 7 o'clock in the evening. It is impossible to move about the cityiin
consequence of the frequency of stray bullets. Many innocent persons have been killed." ''
Revolutionists A-reJ JesperateljT'
Defending Their Barricades.
LONDON. Dec. 26.â The St. Petersburg
Correspondent of the Daily Telegraph
telegraphed the following: yesterday:
â¢'Your Moscow correspondent's ' tele
grams have not been accepted, because
ell private messages were refused this
fcfternoon. It is learned, however, that
Cannon firing is now proceeding in vari
ous parts of the city where, to-night, very
t;^ar the railroad stations, the barricades
\u25bareeled by the' revolutionaries" are being
temperately defended.
"The Kursk Railroad terminus at Mos
cow is being pillagf-d and many cars laden
fsvith provisions are being looted. "
"The Emperor is engaged daily in re
viewing at Tsarkoe-Sslo the regiments of
the Si. Petersburg eistrlct. The srpirit of
the troops is decidedly loyal.
"From fragmentary accounts received
from Moscow I gather that the civil war
has brought no decisive action, but only a
thickening of the blood cloud, an intensi
fying of the horrors and an Increase of
the prevailing bitterness.
ItlMI COURAGE OF REBELS.
"The driving force behind both troops
tnd rebels is no longer that of enthusi
asm or any, human impulse. It is the
force of superhuman hate, and hence the
deefls reported are not the acts of patri
ot**, soldiers or otherwise, but the enor
' taities of madmen. vjjjjjE^E
"It is Impossible to understand how any
emotion, even in the extreme of despair
Â©r hate, can impart such foolhardy cour- '
fege as some of the rebels display. For
â¢â¢very barricade destroyed on Sunday,
two or three appeared in other places.
Orders were given by the revolutionists
Ito shoot only when there was good hope
t>f bringing a man down, but otherwise
to tire out the troops until they lose pa-
tience.
â¢ "In the meantime, In their houses the
Ibulk of the population cowers in the In
most recesses of kitchens and cellars
tetrleken with fear and trembling at ermry
boom of cannon or the explosion of a
bomb.
"The most surprising thing of all is the
loyalty of the troops, which nobody here
expected.
*Â»LA?fS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS.
"Talking with an Intelligent group of
â¬5t. Petersburg revolutionists, I was In
formed that while they believed the strike
*ould be victorious they fully realized
they were staking everything upon the
iFsue and that failure would set back
their cause for several years. They said
they were devoting their efforts to shak
. ing the foundations of "Russian flnance,
in full confidence that once the existing
regime were overthrown, they cculd as
quickly build another and that foreign
nations .would be as ready to advance
money to a democratic republic . as - to
the autocracy. They emphatically denied
that they were Inciting the peasantry to
commit agrarian outrages, declaring that
these outrages were the work of the So
cialists, but they did not deny their ad
vocacy of the distribution of the crown
lands "among the peasants.
"In conclusion they declared that,. In
the event of the. failure of their cause,
they would have recourse to terrorism,
choosing their victims from all classes
of society."

ST.- PETERSBURG. Dec. 25â Direct
telegraphic communication with Mob
cow was severed last night, but the
Government succeeded in restorihg
communication by a roilndabout route
this morning. All reports agree that
the fighting yesterday, which contin
ued until midnight, assumed the nat
ure of a butchery by the machine guns
of the artillery, grape and canister be
ing employed mercilessly against the
ill-armed insurgents.
At Rocius- tales are told of the Cos

times charging, with lances. The in
surgents displayed "great stubbornness
In holding barricades, even advancing
In a mass 'to the slaughter, "
Where bombs were thrown from

and battered the houses to pieces. \u25a0
The plan of the Insurgents,- it Is
said, is to hold the outskirts and'grad- |

an army of 30,000 is concentrated at
Orechoffsueff, northeast of Moscow,

j Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK., Dec. 25iâ As the result of
an investigation which has been j quietly
conducted for several weeks past" the Dis
trict-Attorney's offlce.has come into pos
session of valuable evidence bearing upon
the records of certain high. insurance. of-
ficials whose names have been much be
fore the public _of late. Several of these
officials are likely in the near future to
face charges of petty larceny for having
systematically charged the policy-holders
of their respective companies certain re
curring bills for coal. rugs, bathroom sup
plies and .house; furnishings, "which went
to make up' a substantial grand total of
home comforts in their own domestic es
tablishments.
Named Jn connection with these latest
astonishing developments In the insurance
scandal are John A. McCall, Richard; A.
McCurdy.'L' James Hazen Hyde and sev
eral others, who have ttgured in charges
of high flnance chicanery in the last few

It. lsTnow : known that for ten years at
least it has been: the practice of officers,
and In some cases; of directors, of -the big
insurance companies to order grest quant

and department' stores and have the bills
sent tothe auditors of the companies. In
many ; cases the; goods- were delivered-; to
the offices '. of the â¢ companies and then
sent?to private; homes. Specific cases in
which such ] purchases were made have
been " discovered . by detectives.

is being hampered by the fact that. a rug

January 1. By this action the unions have
officially repudiated the strike of the
structural Ironworkers.
In many of the trades the prevailing
wage will continue for the coming year.
The wages of the house carpenters, how
ever, will be increased 30 cents a day, and
the cabinetmakers will receive an in
crease of 22 cents a day, beginning next
July.
The trade agreements now date from
January 1 instead of May, as hertofore.
This step was taken'because the employ
ers do not want strikes on their hands
on May 1, when the busy building season
begins.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 25.â The Press
to-morrow will say:
"President John Mitchell of the United
Mine Workers' Union has communicated
with the presidents of the anthracite coal
producing companies in regard to the de
mand the miners will make for continu
ance of work in the hard coal fields.
"It Is "understood the letter is in regard
to holding a conference between the com
mittee representing United Mine
Workers and the operators. What the
operators will has not definitely been
decided upon.
"Besides asking for an eight-hour day,
there are also to be presented other de
mands. The most Important, and one that
if adopted will mean the complete recog
nition of the union, is the request that
an entire new conciliation j board be
formedâ one that will always be in ses
sion and will go from place to place to
settle disputes. The request will meet
with considerable opposition from the
presidents.
"The proposed new board is to be com
posed of three members representing the
miners and the same number represent
ing the operators, and a seventh member
to be chosen by the other six."

STATEMENT BY WEIGHT
G o vernor General Has Noth
ing Definite to Say as to
Report of His Resignation
MEMPHIS, Term.. Dec. 25.â Governor
General of the Philippines Luke E". Wright
arrived in Memphis from Washington
this morning. Asked as to the report of
his resignation of \ the Governorship,
Wright would say nothing definite.
"I have heard of this matter ;only since
my return to America, and I am thinking
more of my play now than of my work
six months hence," he -asserted.
Regarding the government of the isl
ands and their future Wright said:
"All the recent bids for the railroad
work have been rejected. We will try
for new estimates, and you may state
that if the next batch are also turned
down one or more important lines will be
built by the Government. It is, indeed,
desirable to develop all the sections where
the proposed roads are to run, but it is
better to allow our friends, whom we are
making into good citizens of the United
States, to wait a little for the prosperity
that will come with such facilities than
to submit to such bids or to give radical
concessions ' to Americans from home.
"But these roads will be built. With
commerce such as should exist between
sister states and territories unrestricted
by any duties, the islanders will by in
creased intercourse have taken a long
step toward self-government. Many
American public men are disposed to view
the ultimate political condition too
gloomily. It will take lime, but it will
come eventually, and free trade, will go
a long way toward making self-govern
ment a possibility. "

FRIEND OF KING
EDWARD HERE
Lord Grimthorpe of London arrived at
the St. Francis late last evening. He
comes to the coast on a pleasure trip.
His lordship Is a great friend of King
Edward, and has been for a long time,
their intimacy, having commenced many
years ago. -
The present Lord , Grimthorpe came
into his title on the death of his uncle,
Lord Grimthorpe (Edmund Beckett), who
was known as " England's "clocklsh"
peer. . He made the construction of time
pieces a fad, and probably In his day
knew more about them than any other
man in Great Britain. On his death his
title fell to \ his heir, Ernest William
Beckett, who is now here.
Lord Grimthorpe looks to be about 40
years of age, although be j has been in
Parliament for twenty years. He* looks
the polished English gentleman to the
letter. . "
In speaking of his visit here he said:
I have been making a pleasure tour of the
United States and have come out to the coast
because I like It. I have: been twice In San
Francisco before, and on those visits ,1 saw_
the country Immediately tributary to it. This
time I am gat ng to .spend a month In your
State, during which period I < intend to- visit
all the principal polnts.of interest from here
to San Diego. I like your city- and* I like
your people. I like the general atmosphere
of the place. That Is the reason" I have come
here for the third time. ;
I think this Is one- of the greatest places In
the United States, and : I think ; from what I
have seen of your .city and Its surroundings,
and what I know of your State, that Califor
nia is one of the greatest. If not the greatest,
State- in the Union. -- I have always liked
America and the Americans. \ I showed that
when I married an S American ' wife, wr She died
Rome years ago.
\u25a0 The \u25a0\u25a0: West Is \u25a0 very different Â» from the East.

BOSTON, Dec. 25.â According to An
dreas Stockberger, an immigrant who
arrived here on the steamship Car

German and comes from a German set
tlement at Gildendorff, near Odessa. In.
an interview to-day he said:
. In Odessa I saw the troops march down the
main street with loaded guns. Before j them
was a hpwllns mob. armed) with all sorts of
\u25a0weapons, and "Whenever a chance ap^eared'H
would pounce upon the soldiers and tear them
to pieces. On housetops and In windows stood
men, women and even children, and as the
soldiers marched by bombs were - hurled at
them, killing scores and wounding- hundreds
at a time. ;\u25a0 ... - \u25a0 ;\u25a0â¢\u25a0
The soldiera would then charge upon their
attackers, piercing them with bayonets â¢ and
shooting them with ball cartridges. Wherever
the soldiers . went they were attacked. The
mob, made up entirely of Jews, were almost
beside themselves with excitement, and their
only purpose was to kill the soldiers.

Fellows' Hall.
It wm at the Christmas dinner of the
Salvation Array yesterday afternoon.
Little "Willie Weoone had just reached
the climax of his dreams. Two weeks be
fore he had received a ticket. The ticket
paid ((Willie had had It spelled out for
him by his big sister Mag, who works in
a. canning factory):
"This will admit bearer to the Salvation
Army Christmas dinner at the Odd Fel
lows* building on Christmas day."
For fourteen days he had coddled that
piece of cardboard, with its mysterious
black "open sesame" characters, as a
mother does her baby. By day he carried
it in his inside breast pocket, right over
the spot that goes thump-thump, thump
tliump all the time. Whenever he thought
of the card the thing that goes thump
thump went thump-thumpety-thump
thump very fast and hard, as if it were
running away. By night the card was
under his pillow, and his dreams were
perfumed with vapors of gravy and
fteaming meats, and he saw mastodon
birds, golden-brown, lying on their backs
with great pitchforks driven into -their
breasts.
Then came Christmas at last. Very
early, almost before it was light, little
Willie Wecone had sneaked out of the
house (he lived up on Telegraph Hill)
end had come downtown, his card safe
over his thump-thump. He came to Mar
ket street, walked up the big thorough
fare to Seventh, then turned to the left
and peered into Stevenson street. But the
narrow way was deserted. And the back
<!or of Odd Fellows' Hall was locked.
It was very cold and the sky was very
gray. There were holes in Willies shoes
and his toes were ticklish with the cold.
Bo he took a turn about the streets. But
when he returned Stevenson street was
Etil! deserted and the door of the hall
was still locked. Through the transom,
'though, there came a fragrant steam that
reminded Willie of the dreams of the last
two weeks. It was too cold to stand still,
though, so Willie went ' off on another
etroll. This time on Howard street he
met some boys who were playing 'Muck
on-the-r'ock," and he joined them. Thus it
was that when he again returned to Ste
venson street it was past 10 o'clock, and
Willie saw what he had feared to see.
The door of the hall was open now and
a big fat "copper" was standing in front
of it. And beneath the bitter sky. along
the cold brick wall, a line of men
stretched almost to Market street. They
were not happy looking men. Their
clothes had holes, their shoes had holes.
Their beards were long and matted and
the cheeks beneath almost met inside
their mouths, as if they were drawing
In their breathe.
WILLIE GETS IX LIKE.
Willie took his place in the line behind
c man whose chocs were tied up witb
twine and who did not seem strong-, for
ie ]Â«?*: .f*l aJLthe time against the brick
valL There he waited long. /
Finally a man with a red jersey on had
come to the door, the policeman had made
a signal and suddenly the line had moved
forward. Willie came to the red-jerseyed
man and reluctantly gave him the card,
now, it must be said, rather smutted with
finger iuarks. And then he was in.
It was beautiful inside. First of all a
fragrant, warm, gravy-pmelliug wind had
\u25a0truck him softly In the face. And then
It wasn't cold in here. And from the ceil
ing of the big hall there streamed red
vhite-and-blue cloths just like flags. And
there were five long tables, all white, full
of knives and forks and plates and
glasses, and with oranges all along their
miduies. And all over the hall there were
pretty lassies dressed In red waists. And
at the end of the hall there were a lot of
nit-bt scrumptious-looking, splendiferous
fellows, all dressed in red and with big
bra^s horns In their hands. As Willie
*at down in the place pointed out to him
by one of the red-walsted lassies, those
beautiful men all stood up, put their
horns to their mouths and began to play.
And the little girl that sat next to himâ
a very little girl with golden hair, but
with thin cheeks that were blue, and big.
dark circles? under her eyesâ jumped up
on her chair and began to clap her hands
in time with the music.
Then had come the fulfillment of the
dreams. -Before Willie, whose chin just
sbout reached the table, had been laid a

things. There was roast beef and tur
key and turnips and mashed potatoes
and dressing and plenty of gravy. And
by the left side of the plate was bread
and butter. And in front of the plate was
a dish of oranges. And at the right side
of the plate was a big square of mince
pie and a big cup chuck-full of steaming
coffee.
And \Vl"i^ had eaten and eaten and
eaten. Once the l'ttle maid to his left, in
her frenzied applause of the music,
knocked lii* fork out of his hand. Ho
ricked It up and ate ani'ate. Another

All this time he had been paying some
attention to his neighbors. H<? did not
approve of them. The little golden-haired
girl to his left .lust nibbled like a little
mouse, so busy was she standing up to
clap her hands at the music. And the 1
girl to his right, a big girl, almost four
teen, also did not eat much. She was too
busy helping her four little brothers to
eat herself. But what he disapproved
most of all was this: That all were drink
ing their coffee while they ate their meat.
Willie had another plan. A wise head
was on that little Willie Weeone. Up
where he lives, a piece of mince pie and
a cup of coffee make a meal, not a part
of a meal, not a dessert, but a whole
meal. Willie was going to have two
meals. He was saving the pie and the
FINISHES FIRST COURSE.
So at last he had come to the climax
of his reveries. He ehoved back his plate,
so clean now that the dishwashers, whose
clatte/ing toil he could hear in the depths
of the hall, would have really very little
to do. Then, very, flrmly, be before
him his cup of coffee, still intact, and. his
mince pie.. Taking his spoon, he dug deep
into a dish seemingly full of sugar in the
center of the table. ' Two heaping spoon
fuls he emptied Into his cup, then, after
a moment's hesitation, a third. Then,
raising himself in his chair, he approached
his lips to the rim of the nectar.
Suddenly. . above the din of tinkling
knives and busy forks, there arose in the
hall a long-piercing yell. Knives and forks
stopped in midair. Jaws hung agape,
paralyzed. Consternation fell, upon the
happy scene like a black pall.
The long shriek was followed by a chok
ing, spluttering sound, then regulated
itself into a woeful sobbing. At first every
one was nonplused. Willie Weeone, it has
been said, was small, and it took a long
time to find that he was the cause of the
commotion. ' '\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0
"What is the matter?" asked a red
waisted lassie, pushing up to him.,
"My co-o-o-offee. I put, I put, I put."
boo-hooed Willie, but he could go no fur
ther.
"What is the matter?" cried the horror
stricken chef, rushing up from the depths
of the kitchen.
"I put, I put, I put." sobbed Willie,
: but he could go no further.
"Qoodness, do tell us what ails you,"
implored Colonel French, he who had or
ganized the whole dinner.
"I put salt, salt, salt in my co-o-o-ffee:"
at. length came from Willie in a burst of
explanation and -misery.
The -dish in which he had delved deep
was full, not of sugar, but of salt.
Thus it is that the happiest day will
sometimes end in tragedy. But this trag
edy proved to be a melodrama after all.
It ended happily. For from all parts of
the hall, at the "explanatory howl, lassies
came rushing with fresh cups of coffee
(unsaited), and Willie Weeone. the upper
button of his trousers carefully loosened,
finished his second meal. .

Th* flrure of Christ is the most consDlcu

glory divine, lighted from his own personality.
The fact of Christ is ever cumulative, increas

There are two absolute essentials on which
the whole superstructure of Christianity as
a. supernatural revelation of religion rests.
The one is celebrated at Christmas; the other
at Easter.
Whatever may be postulated and oredicated
of Christianity in its origin and in its out
come grows out of the Incarnation of Christ
and i# Iby resurrection. These are
the supporting, pillars of the. arch of \u25a0 revealed
truth, and Jesus Is the keystone srivlng it
unity, symmetry and . strength. Take these
Dlllars away and you lift out the keyetone

HIGH MASS CELEBRATED.
.Mhh.v People Attend the Cerrmonle* at
. St. . ICBKtius Church.
Impressive Christmas services were
held in St. Ignatius Church all the
forenoon yesterday. Beginning early
in the morning, masses were said until
11 o'clock, when a solemn high mass
was sung by "Father Allen, celebrant;
Father Sardl, deacon; Father Francis,
sub-deacon; . Mr. Laherty, master- of
ceremonies, and about forty acolytes.
The sermon was delivered by the Rev.
Joseph W. Riordan. ./
A special musical programme under
the , direction of Dr. .Morris * O'Connell
was given by the male choir at the
first mass, solemn, high mass and at
solemn vespers and 'benediction. in the
evening. To all , these, the mu
sic, as well as the impressive services,
attracted many non-Catholics and the
church was crowded- to the doors.
Father Riordan, taking as his sub
ject, "His Name Shall be Called the
Prince of Peace,*' preached a beautiful
sermon on ' the birth of Christ. He
said in part:
_But some one may object to .calling him
Prince of Peace, who from his very birth
oroved a. disturbing e-omcit to all' the woriJ
and urovÂ«Â« co now. For no sooner was he
born than Herod was troubled and all Jeru
salem with him. A title is given the child
which alarms the state and the peaceful hills
of Bethlehem are red with Innocent blood.
Ah. brethren, the angels at his birth have
srlven the salutation "Glory to God in the
hlehest and, on earth to men of good will,
peace." Here is the limitation to men of good
will. "Peace I leave with you." was his last
testament to his apostles. "My peace. l give
to you; not as the. world giveth do I give
you," for hig mission had been as. Zachery
In prophetic spirit had foretold: "To enlighten
them that, sit in darkness and in the shadow
of death; to direct our feet into the way ot
peace."
Which nf you knt-elinc there is more like
Christ in poverty?' . What a lesson he has
luuehi to console the poor and teach the rich
the nothinciiirps of \u25a0 earth? Sweet â¢is : poverty
when borne with" Christ; easy Is poverty in
the hopes of a better life: humble and kind
are riches that worship the poverty of the
babe of Bethlehem. \u25a0

precious Christmas, gift of our heaven
ly father. In the course of his remarks
he showed in, an: eloquent; manner, not

gift according to the plainly declared
intention of the giver, but also the per
sons for whom it was Intended, namely
for all men- on earth. : .
Splendid music was rendered not only
by the entire congregation : joining in

At 11. o'clock yesterday morning a

there was a full quota from the neigh

all -ages and paid respectful attention
to the words of* the Blsliop.' Bishop
Nicholssaid that thetlittle ones should
bear in mind that the day is a feast
day of Christ and not the feast day of
Santa Claus and that ;lt was from
Christ that all good came and to whom
thanks must be given for all blessings.
On Christmas eve* the choir of the
mission held its yearly festival, singing
Christmas carols, and the' result was
far in- excess of the expectations. .The

Thousands of People . Attend the Ser
vice* at St. Mary's.
From early dawn to late at * night
thousands of people thronged to St.
Mary's Cathedral to worship at the
crib of - the , infant Christ. There was
a great contrast between the new-born
child, ln the lowly manger of Bethlehem
and the -magnificent little image lying
in a, jeweled receptacle with myriads
of candles surrounding it. Yet the
solemnity of the scene was so iraprea-'
sive as to the mind back to the
city : of Bethlehem and one thought
only of the infant in the dimly lighted
stable -where ; kings came to worship
and hosts of . angels kept watch.
At 5 o'clock the Cathedral bells be
gan calling the faithful, to church and
mass was celebrated at half hour In
tervals from that time , up to 11, when
solemn high mass was sung by the
Right. Reverend Bishop Montgomery,
assisted by Very Reverend Father Pren

and Fathers Sullivan and O'Ryan, act

Father O'Ryan preached a beautiful
sermon on the birth of Christ and told
of the disappointment when he estab
lished his kingdom, which was not the
kingdom :of Rome. Not in Rome, not
even in Jerusalem,' was he born, but in
a .stable he held court; his clothes,
swaddling clothes; his cradle a manger.)
and . his retinue the ox and the ass.

The music, directed by Louis H.
Eaton, the organist and choirmaster,
was never more exquisitely rendered at
this church, and the sermon by the
Rev. J Frederick W. Clampett. D. D., the
rector, was impressive in the extreme.
Dr. Clampett in part spoke as fol
lows:'
' The atory of Bethlehem has been before the
world for â¢ 2000 years, and yet It is as fresh
and beautiful to-day as it was in its first ut
terance. .
The reason for this can easily be explained.
No event has ever taken place ' that met the
needs 'of - suffering, . toiling, humanity- as the
birth into this world of him whom we worship
as''- the. t locos â the word; Immanuel â "God
with us." .-. Indeed, It 'may be called a etory
intensely- human. - .
\u25a0 In the days gone by the church guarded with
jealousy the divine Idea centered in this event,
so that the nativity of Christ was not a fes
tival- of popular character. â¢ A great mystery
was. cast 'about his divinity. The life was
viewed as one far removed from man. so that
he was ' worshiped as from a distance.
-But. a {remarkable change has taken place.
The most- scholarly and prominent of the bi
ographies of Christ give due and true place to
his human character. The festival has received

hand there may be discovered undoubted erl

Briefly, let me put before you those most
prominent phase* of - the story of Bethlehem
â¢which give to it this unique place. First, it
was absolutely supernatural. In a sense that
admits of.no disputation, the divine linking of
heaven, and of earth then took place, if ever
such a Unking were possible. It was the mes
sage of ar. angel that announced the coming
birth. It was the chorus of the heavenly host
that proclaimed to the astonished shepherds thÂ»
fact accomplished, it was the guiding of a
star that brought into the infant presence the
wise men from the. East. ...
All the incidents that surround the story
prove that In s o far from being an evolution
of natural condition, it was the work and the
message from heaven to earth, from God to
man.
ST. PAUL'S CHURCH FILLED.
Rev. Mr.' Rellly Delivers a Most Im
pressive Sermon.' f
There was a great congregation of
worshipers of St. Paul's Episcopal
Church, California street, near Fillmore,
yesterday morning, which beheld "r" r on en
tering the edifice a wealth of wonderful
decorations appropriate to the season.
The choir rendered the Christmas
hymns and carols with grand \u25a0 effect
and the pastor, the Rev. "William Max
well Rellly, delivered a sermon which
was listened to with the most intense
interest. ;
In part the Rev. Mr. Rellly' said:
We have, as it were, comÂ« to Bethlehem to
day to see the things which the Lord has
brought. to pass. We have listened again to
thÂ« wondrous story, we have suns agala th#
old Christmas carols, and now let us ask what
Is their effect uocn our hearts, what influ
ences will they exert henceforth on our lives.
It matters very little how the heavenly mas
sage comes to us. whether through the lips of
an angel or through the lips of those whom
the Lord has commissioned to tell evermore the
story of his redeeming: love â the effect in all
human probability will always be the same.
Some, like the people of Bethlehem, will simply
wonder. Others, like Mary, will keep th*
words and ponder them in their hearts. Other*
helped, cheered and comforted, will return to
life's duties to fulfill them with e!aJ hearts.
All that beard the tidings wondered. It was
the most wonderfut tidings the world bad ever
heard. It announced the coming of Him
through whom all the families of the earth
were to be blessed. It announced the comlnx
of Him to Trhom the mystic name, the Mighty
God the Everlasting Father, the Prince of
Peace had been given. It declared that Go<l
Almighty â God who ia over all. blessed for
evermore. God who ia the source of all life,
condescended to come among us. clad 'In th^
garments of our humanity: that he had become
Immanuel â God with vs â for evermore.
The Incarnation of the Son of God is the
great fact which we commemorate to-day. Ton
can no more take away this fact from Chris
tianity than you can take thought from living
speech, than you can separate soul and body
and have a living man still. Christianity is
belief in the word made flesh.
Is It ' any wonder that the birth of Je3uÂ»
Christ became thÂ« turning point In history? All
that preceded his coming led up to It. All
that since has followed points back to it. Th^
Incarnation is the fact upon which we should
fix our faith to-day. It Is the fact which
exalts our humanity. Jesus Christ came to
seek and to save us. The nature which hÂ»
took unto himself he carried to the cross
through the sates of death up to the very
throne of Cod.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 26. 190o!
TELL LOVE IN ALASKA AND WED
QUIETLY IN SAN FRANCISCO.
Luther Brown of Los Angeles and Miss
Alice Clark of Nevada Are United.
A romance that had its beginning in
Alaska two years ago' culminated In a
quiet wedding at the Palace Hotel yes
terday afternoon, when Miss Alice Clark
became the wife of Luther G. Brown, one
of the best known of the younger mem-,
bers of the bar in Los Angeles. The
bride, who is an exceptionally attractive
briinette, is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
11. H. Clark of Nevada, her father being
a widely known mining man, whose in
terests in Tonopah and Bullfrog have
netted him a large fortune. Mrs. Brown
is a California girl and a graduate of
Mills Seminary. Although she has spent
a great deal of her life in Nevada, she
has made many visits to San Francisco j
and enjoys a large acquaintance here,
where the news of her marriage will be
received as a pleasant surprise by the
majority of her young friends.
Luther Brown is as well known in San
Francisco as in his adopted town, for he
has taken an active part in politics, most
notably as secretary of the Congressional
committee that managed the campaign
of Congressman McLachlan. Although
the law is his profeseipai Bxown is also
interested in several mining ventures and
it was this fact that was materially re
sponsible for yesterday's marriage. '".
Two years ago Brown and Clark, the
latter accompanied by his wife and
daughter, went to Alaska, and while Mrs.
Clark and her pretty daughter remained
in Nome, th*Â» young lawyer and Clark
proceeded north to the region of
the Arctic circle on an exploration tour.
It was in Nome that Brown and Miss
Clark first met. An attachment developed
between the young couple and It soon
became known to Brown's newly made
acquaintances in the north that ha was
wooing the fair maiden.. His persistency
eventually won for him a promise of
marriage and returning to Los Angeles
Brown impatiently bided his time until he
could claim Miss Clark as his bride.
It had been originally arranged that the
wedding should be celebrated in an elab
orate manner in the home that the Clarks
are building across the bay, but delaylng
ing contractors upset ' the carefully laid
plans of the couple, and the scene of the
nuptial ceremony was changed to the
Palace Hotel, where the Clarks have been
living* during their stay in San Francisco.
Judge Frank J. Kerringan officiated at
the wedding, which was attended only by
the Immediate relatives of the bride, and
a few hours after he had pronounced the
couple husband and wife Mr. and Mrs.
Brown were speeding eastward' on their
honeymoon trip, which will include a visit
to Washington, where the happy husband
has a business engagement. Returning to
California several weeks hence, Mr. and
Mrs. Brown will make thelr.home in Los
Angeles.

Placed on Calendar and Fam
ily at Once. Causes
Trouble.
Special Dispatch to The CaU.
â¢PITTSBURG, Dec. 25.â "Beauty and the
Beast," an art calendars printed in Eliza
beth, N. J., is commanding cabinet photo
graph prices and more, notwithstanding
the fact that it bears the advertisement
of a firm of butchers. It may Involve the
publisher In \u25a0.; a.; damage j suit, because
"Beauty" is recognized as Mrs. Florence
Evelyn Nesbit Thaw, the former model
and show girl, now the wife of Harry
Kendall Thaw, the Pittsburg millionaire.
The calendar chows a beautiful girl re
clining on the skin of a polar bear. The
head of the "beast" remains attached to
the pelt and the cheek of the beautiful
woman Is pressed agalns^ the jaw of the
brute. There seems to have been no at
tempt on the, part of the butchers to make
capital of the Thaw- social sensation, for
they confessed that they were at loss
to know why the calendar became so pop
ular the first day that they could not
hand them out fast enough.
It was all explained "when an agent of
the Thaw family called at the shop and
demanded the entire edition. , At first the
butchers refused and were inclined to be
defiant. But when the 'agent threatened
their arrest and offered to pay a good
price for all that were left, the butchers
surrendered what remained. Then the
agent went, out to buy up. the copies that
had been given away. People are holding
on to them and few who possess the pic
ture will admit it.

Meager Details of Accident to Un

NORFOLK, Va., Dec. 25.â With all
her headgear torn .; away and her top
sails set, an unknown three-masted
schooner has sunk in twelve fathoms of
water six and a' half miles northeast
of Winter Quarter lightship, and di
rectly in the path. of coastwise naviga
tion. The information is contained in
a report made here by Captain Charles
James of the "Merchants' and, Miners'
steamship Juanita, \u25a0 which passed the
wreck yesterday.'.
According to Captain, _ James, the
schooner evidently was the victim of a
collision. Only her topmasts above the
crosstrees are out of water and the ap
pearance of j her topsails indicates that
the disaster, occurred - not long before
the Juanita passed.; No sign of wreck
age was sfeen, however, nor was there
anything ''above to reveal the ..identity
of the schooner. The fate of her crew
is not known.

FIRE THREATENS
THE TENEMENTS
Big Factory Destroyed in
New York and Panic Ensues
Among Near-by Residents
CROWDS FILL STREETS
Two JUjgn Fight in High Win
dow While Throng Below
Watches Strange Struggle
NEW YORK, Dec. 25.â Hundreds of ten
ement babies and their toy-laden Christ
mas trees were carried into the street
before daylight to-day during a fire which
threatened to obliterate several blocks of
the city in the vicinity of Fifty-eighth
Btreet and Eleventh avenue. A six-story
factory building at 534 and 538 West Fifty
eighth street was completely destroyed,
with a loss of $100,000.
With tenement houses on three sides
and with the gas tanks of the Consoli
dated- Gas Company within reach of
showjers of* sparks, the water pressure
partly failed when the fire was hottest.
Fire engines were hastily coupled togeth
er, pumping "In pairs, and this device, to
gether with the bold work of the firemen,
who advanced almost into the zone of
the flames in' order to play on the fire
with the weak streams, finally saved the
hundreds of surrounding homes.
The flre was first discovered when
flames burst from the third-story window
and belched completely across Fifty
eighth street with a roar like a discharg
ing cannon. When the fire department
arrived and tried to put up its compressed
air extension ladders to the sixth floor
the ladders refused to extend. This de
layed the firemen several minutes. i
Half an hour after the fire started, al
though it was still long before daylight,
the rooms of Roosevelt Hospital, some
distance away, were lighted as If by day
light. There was great alarm among
both patients and their attendants.
Such crowds rushed out of the tenement
houses near the, flre that the police from
several stations were called out to handle
them. At'the height of the flre thousands
of spectators momentarily forgot the
burning building in watching a struggle
In the upper window of a tenement-house
in Fifty-eighth street. A man started to
climb over the window sill to drop to the
street In his night clothes. Another man
rushed out to save him. The two fought
in the window above the sidewalk, while
the crowd below cleared a semicircle. A
blanket picked up at hazard from bed
ding which other tenants were trying to
save was stretched directly under the
window. It was not needed, however, for
the; half-crazed man was drawn back
through the window by main strength.
The sun had risen before the last of the
Christmas trees was carried back into the
tenement houses and the danger was en
tirely over. One fireman was injured by
falling glass.

Francisco.
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
VICTOR, Colo.. Dec. 25.â James Old
field, charged with burglary and a sus
pect In connection with the murder of
Frank Scott at Colorado Springs, has
confessed several "burglaries, but denies
all knowledge of the Colorado Springs

Oldfield says his correct name Is James

burglaries were numerous in Denver he
was one of the men who worked with a
gang of thieves' and showed them how to

statement from Judge Andrew Hamilton,
which McCall was sent to Parts to pro

proposition with regard to the $233,000 of
funds paid to Hamilton, which, it will bo

Female Servant.
NEW YORK. Dec. 25.â Jacob H.
Schiff. banker, gave his cook. Lena, a
$5000 check for a Christmas present to
day.
Every one in the Schiff family has
the highest regard for Lena. There Is
not a dyspeptic atom In the dinners she
prepares. Indeed, it is said that the
only reason Schiff wanted to fight Cor
nelius X. Bliss at that famous meeting
of the Equitable directors was that
SchifT was late for a dinner Lena had
cooked.
Mrs. Schiff gave Lena a cluster-dia
mÂ°ull r l ns - Mrs - Fellx Wernburg.
Schiff s daughter, presented the cook
with a gold watch and a neck chain
and Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer Schiff sent
Lena a handsome check.

German, but found it more profitable
to cook in German fashion. Twenty
five years ago to-day she fell off a
Â« iTi^T 8 tr t ee ; so to "Peak, into the
Schiff household. Now she is inde
pendent financially. She cooks for
love of 'the Schiffs and of her art.

Soap Bubble Fountain
Don't miss seeing this splendid mechanical novelty
â A fountain 25 feet high, topped by a figure of a
Fairy. The bubbles flow from the top of the
fountain and are caught on their downward way by
two large porcelain bowls, finally falling in snowy
white masses around a large octagon base. Numer-
ous colored electric lights "ingeniously placed in the
fountain shine through the millions of bubbles, pro-
ducing an effect indescribably beautiful.
Fairy is an oval cake of pure, white, floating
SOAP; and the remarkable results obtained by its
use in the fountain demonstrate its superior quality.

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
INSULTER OF WOMEN GIVEN
SEVERE PUNISHMENT.
Accosts a Berkeley
";Ath!ete's Wife
to His Woe.
BERKELEY . Dec. 25.â Enraged by a
Vicious and most insulting attack upon
hls wife, Walter Christie, trainer in
the athletic department of the Uni
versity of California, this morning
avenged the offense by beating M. C.
Bailey until the latter was scarcely
able to stand. Bailey's insulrs were
offered to Mrs. Christie on the uni
ver.sity campus as she passed under
the oaks close to the Dana-street en
trance. Christie secured such repara
tion as the memory of a sound beat-
Ing given to the offender inspires, and
eecured it within 200 feet of the spot
in the campus where Bailey stood
when Mrs. Christie was obliged to en
dure his advances.
Officer Killian, an assistant to
Gr<3und Superintendent Hugill, re-
X-orted the affair to Marshal Vollmer
et noon, and search for Bailey was at
ance begun. The campus was scoured
and the surrounding territory of hill
Â£nd town examined, but no trace of the
who had been so summarily
punished by Trainer Christie could be
found.
Mrs. Christie was almost prostrated
by the shock and excitement incidental
to her encounter with Bailey. She re
pulsed him when he approached her
on the campus, and fled as fast as her
feCt could take her to the Christie
home on Durant avenue. The husky
university trainer listened with flam-
Ing cheeks to the wife's story, and
then, without a word, hurried forth.
He did not go to the police with a
complaint, but went at once to the
campus. His wife had given him a
good description of the fellow, saying
that he was a man of about 50, with
dark gray mustache, wearing black
"clethes, short of etature and with a
.countenance best described by the sin
gle word 'evil."
Christie hunted his man for thirty
minutes before he encountered him.
Wben the prey was discovered Chris
tie recognized him as Bailey, a citizen
\u25a0who had been arrested by the police
last summer for insulting women.
TJ Ithout much preliminary conversa
tion, the big trainer waded Into Bailey,
informing him between punches that
the campus was an awfully poor place
In which to Insult and attack defense
less women and that the climate here
3s particularly unhealthful for men ad
dicted to that sort of thing. Bailey
was pummeled and pounded and rolled
In the dirt, until Trainer Christie be-
Jieved the proper amount of punish
ment had been administered. Then,
with a parting kick Bailey was pushed
Into Strawberry Creek, from which he
emerged, wet to the skin.
Report of the affair was later made
1o Ground Superintendent Hugill, and
SCOTT'S EMUL.SIOX.
BOTH FOOD
AND MEDICINE.
We like best to call Scott's
Emulsion a food-medicine. It
is a term that aptly describes
the character and action of
our Emulsion. More than a
[medicineâ more than a food,
yet combining the vital prin-
ciples of both. It is for this
reason that Scott's Emulsion
[has a distinct and special
value in all wasting diseases.
There is nothing better to
remedy the troubles of im-
perfect growth and delicate
health in children. The action
of Scott's Emulsion is just as
effective in treating weak-
ness and wasting in adults.

his force, with several men from Mar
shal Vollmer's office, hunted for Bailey,
without success.
Bailey's name appears on the police
records, with the information that he
was booked by former Deputy L. J.
Moran on August 19. His residence
was not given at that time, and he
was released a few hours after he was
arrested, upon his own recognizance
apparently, promising to cease insult
ing women.

PUTER REMAINS
OUT OF SIGHT
Officials Api>arently De
ceived by Declaration Wife,
of Man Made to Them
IS ACCUSED OF FRAUD
Wisconsin Officers Would
Like Much to Get Glimpse
of Land Case Witness
BERKELEY, Dec. 25.â Such hope as
was Inspired in the breasts of the Police
Department and the Federal officers of
San Francisco by Mrs. S. A. -D. Puter's
statement last week that Mr. Puter,
earnestly desired by the authorities in
connection with the Oregon land fraud
cases, would arrive from the north last
Saturday night has died.
Mr. Puter was to come In on the steam
er Pomona from Eureka. His wife said
he was "up in Mendocino County on busi
ness." He would "surely be back on the
Pomona by Saturday . night." He certain
ly did not arrive, and the secret service
men are at sea.
The hunt for Puter, alleged to be a land
swindler on a bier, s*cale, i 3 now on in
earnest. It is feared that he was warned
in sufficient time to. permit him. to leave
the country. The net will be drawn about
him if any trace of "his whereabouts is
found, and when he is caught the officials
believe they will have landed a very large
flsh from the troubled waters of the Ore
gon land fraud pond.
Puter was scheduled to come forward
in January as a witness in the land fraud
case against Binger Hermann. He was
released months ago upon his promise to
appear, with Horace McKinley, in -the
capacity of a witness. Now it has devel
oped that he has operated, apparently
since his release, as a swindler, procuring
a large sum of money from Hiram God
dard of La Crosse, Wis., selling Goddard
title to timber land in Oregon which he
never owned. The title was fraudulent.
The Wisconsin officials telegraphed to
the authorities here three weeks ago to
arrest Puter, and since that time diligent
6earch for him has been made. . Mrs.
Puter said her husband would appear as
soon as his business in the East and
Mendocino County was finished.

OAKLAND, Dec. 25.â Committees ap
pointed by the Merchants' Exchange
and the Oakland Real Estate Associa
tion have named Wilbur Walker of
the exchange and Hugh M. Cameron of
the Real Estate Association to oppose
the adoption of the proposed license
ordinance. The representatives of the
two bodies will appear before the City
Council to-morrow evening. The Oak
land Board of Trade will be requested

purpose.
CHARGED WITH INSANITY.
OAKLAND, Dec 25. â Because he
created a disturbance at the Raymond
Hotel, 568 Twelfth street, of which he
is the proprietor, aged Peter Knutson,
whose actions for some time have given
his relatives cause to think him insane,
was arrested last -night and charged at
the City Prison with disturbance of the
peace. It is probable that his daughter,
Miss Anna Knutson, will swear to a
complaint charging her father with in
sanity.

United States District At
torney Will Proceed With
Criminal Prosecution of
Defaulting M. Lulu Bowen
WORKING UP PLEA
BASED OX TEAKS
Effort Will Be Made to
Spare Thieving Woman : if
Robbing Man Who Ruined
Her Can Be Apprehended
OAKLAND, Dec. 25.â With dispatch
and decision the Federal officers have
cleared away all of the preliminaries and
prepared themselves for the prosecution
of Miss M. Lulu Bowen, self-confessed
embezzler of more than $7000 of United
States postoffice funds while she was
clerk at Postoffice Substation No. 1 in
this city.
How strongly that prosecution will be
presented is a question not fully .deter
mined^ It rests largely upon develop
ments during the coming two or three
days. While the authorities safeguard
ing the Government's interests are not
going on record as to their intention,
there is current in official circles what
appears to be a well-grounded theory
that Miss Bowen is not considered by the
postofflce authorities the real criminal.
Though she has confessed to the theft,
the idea gains. ground that the prosecu
tion should be \u25a0 more strongly 'pressed
against Louis W. Baker, the man in the
case, according to Miss Bowen's own
piteous story.
Baker's continued absence and silence
in the face of the flaring publicity which
has been given to the remarkable defal
cation tends . yet more strongly to con
vince the officials that the missing printer
had guilty knowledge of the source
whence came the thousands of dollars
Miss Bowen says she gave her erstwhile
employer and friend for the mere asking.
That Baker has toyed with the confi
dence of a weak woman is the confirmed
belief of those who have been investi
gating the circumstances.
FRIENDSHIP STROXG.
For years the pair have known each
other. Since childhood their acquain
tance has run, so Miss. Bowen explained
to her patroness, and benefactress, .Mrs.
Matilda Brown. It has leaked, as such
things do leak, that Baker had .been a
constant visitor at the station, so con
stant that gossip's nimble tongue had
long been busy.
Mrs. Brown heard of these frequent
calls. She taxed Miss Bowen long ago.
Otfiers, not entirely disinterested, had
mentioned the friendship Baker mani
fested toward the .young woman. It
did not seem quite right in the eyes
of the curious, for Baker was married.
But Mirs Bowen's explanations were
satisfactory to Mrs. Brown. The elder
woman was told that her protege was
an old childhood friend of Baker who
had given Miss Bowen employment as
a bookkeeper to help her make her
living. The only objection was Miss
Bowen's handling the books at the
postofflce. This she forbade. This
bookkeeping was the excuse at least
for Baker's, constant attentions.
Whether the work was of such a na
ture as to require such.unremittlng.at
tention is problematical. In the busi
ness district Baker was not considered
as Al. His establishment was not so
extensive as to require a large staff
of employes. In fact Mrs. Baker has
herself admitted that her husband was
not heavily engaged. It is likely Miss
Bowen was aware of Baker's condition.
She has Insisted from the start that the
money she turned over to him was
given with the distinct understanding
that it should be used in the business.
SAYS BAKER BORROWED.
She asserted to-day to Postal Inspector
,R. W. Maddern and Assistant District
Attorney Everett Brown that Baker had
merely borrowed the money to meet tem
porary financial exigencies. . Miss Bowen
said the coin went to pay off his em
ployes and meet other obligations. And
her persistent . reiteration compelled the
belief that in this she was sincere, even
if the; future shall discover how she may
have : been duped. 1 :-';
It is the firm belief to-night of the post
office authorities that . Miss Bowen has
been left: in the lurch by Baker, that
even : though : he might not . have contem
plated : flight when he departed . last Sat
urdey, he is now a fugitive, with the
hue; and cry of' the United States' Gov
ernment after him. "At the Baker home,
997 Tenth street, ; to-night : all was inky
blackness and silence pervaded the place.
Not a 'word, had: been received by Mrs.
Baker from her husband, and this Christ
mas day 'was one -of unutterable sadness
to a trusting woman.
- The Bakers have been married about
ten years. The wife came from the East.
She was in litigation several . years ago
with an uncle named, Merrill, whom she
charged "with defrauding her of $7000 or
$8000. She lost.the suit. A suggestive re
mark: reported to have been. made Satur
day by Baker to his foreman gives color
to the theory that he contemplated* flight
at that; time. It is said he declared "if
anything -should happen before I. return
keep the office running for my wife."

THIEVES TAKE
MISER'S HOARD
Spree of Stingy Seattle
Man Costs Him Large Part
of the Savings of Years
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Dec. 25.â For years Michael
Murphy, who has lived In a miserable
shack on the sand spit, has been known
as a miser who had much wealth. But
not until last night was the amount of
his worldly possessions known. Murphy
started to spend Christmas on the night
of the 23d by going on a spree. He
picked up a few companions in some of
the less desirable saloons and took them
home with him. Yesterday afternoon
when he awoke, as is his custom he
went to his" treasure box to look over the
wealth he had . accumulated by depriving
himself of many of the necessaries of life.
When he examined his strong box he
found the following missing: A certifi
cate of deposit for $1500 on the Canadian
Bank of Commerce, one for $300 on the
Scandinavian Bank and one for $75 on the
Seattle National Bank, Great Northern
pay checks calling for $130 and $12 In cash.
PIONEER OF NEBRASKA
KILLED BY GRIZZLIES
Simon B. Clark of Omaha Loses Him
Life In Battle With
Bears.
OMAHA, Dec. 25. â Simon B. Clark of
Omaha, one of the best known pio
neers of Nebraska, was recently killed
In a battle, with grizzly bears In the
Big Horn country. The news was con
tained in a letter from a ranchman
named Adams, who said Clark's horse
came to his ranch on December 21.
Recognizing the animal. Adams fol
lowed the trail back five miles Into the
mountains, where he found the badly
mangled body of Clark at the mouth
of a cave and beside It two dead griz
zlies.
. Clark, who was generally known as
"Blondy," was an old soldier and was
well known as a plainsman and hunter."
He has held numerous public offices in
Omaha.
makes Its demand to-morrow for the
missing funds. In what shape and
upon whom that demand will be made
has not been determined ~
Mrs. Brown holds herself morally re
sponsible for the \ defalcation of Miss
Bowen because Miss Bowen was her
own" selection. Postmaster Dargie will
open sub-station No. 1 to-morrow
morning. But the office will not be In
charge or Mrs. Brown. \ The successor
to Miss Bowen will be Miss Jessie E.
Logan, who for several years has been
clerk at the, Alden sub-station. This
means that Mrs. Brown will be relieved
of the unhappy post which she held so
long for the sake of the young woman
who betrayed her trust.
CASE TO BE PUSHED.
Maddern to-morrow will place the
case of Miss Bowen before the United
States District Attorney, who will take
such further action as shall be con
sidered due the matter. The arrest of
Baker will be demanded. Settlement
of the shortage will .take place to-mor
row, f As to : her attitude toward the
case Mrs. 'Brown said to-night:
"I feel sorry for Miss Bowen. She
has .done Uwo men's work there for
weeks .past and got : nothing extra for
it. During the holidays there has been
a very large amount of business and
she attended to it all alone. For my
self : I cannot say how It will termi
nate. If the Government decides that
I ; am responsible for the loss I shall
make It good; but at the present I do
not know-how things will shape them
selves. To-morrow we can tell better
what can be done. If Baker used the
money to pay. off . a mortgage It may
be: there, in the business and I "may be
able to \u25a0 recover \u25a0 some of > It. ; I have al
ways-believed .that I; was responsible

BALLOT TO BE TAKEN
Only Ten Out of Twenty-
Three Now Doing Bpsk
ness Can Eetain Permits
. BERKELEY, Dec. 28.â A session 0*
the Town Trustees that will aeal thÂ«
fate of the saloon-keepers of Berkeley
la to be held to-morrow nlffht. at which,
time the Trustees will put thirteen
saloon men out of business. The num
ber of drinking places has been re
duced by ordinance from twenty-three
to ten, and to-morrow' the fortunate
ten are to be cho9en by the Trustees.
The measure reducing the saloons la
perhaps the most radical action ever
taken by the governing officials of
Berkeley, so far as the liquor Interests
are concerned. It Is .expected to re
sult In the wiping: out of all saloons la
South Berkeley, where two now exist.
and to reduce the number of liquor
shops In West Berkeley to half the
present number. For weeks the liquor
men have exerted every Influence which
could possibly be brought to bear on
the powers that be, each man trying to
save his own business from destruction.
Some of the saloon men that are affect
ed have conducted Institutions In West
Berkeley for so many years that their
places are almost historic. Dennis
Landregan la one pioneer and Fred W.
Munday is another. A score more, with
these two men, -will watch the ballot-
Ing to-morrow night, as men watch the
movement that spells life or death for
them.
Originally, it was planned by tha
Trustees to have each Trustee say what
men should Lave saloon licenses in the
Trustee's ward. This would have placed
almost all the responsibility on two
or three Trustees, and the plan was
abandoned.
The modus operand! to-morrow will
require each Trustee to name ten liquor
men whom the Trustees think are de
serving of licenses. The candidates
having the most votes will get the
coveted permission to do business. Each
man thus favored will hereafter pÂ«/
$600 a year tax instead of $300, 3

THE TRADE YEAR CLOSING ACTIVELY.
jT IS now the holiday season when trade ought by all precedent
I to be dull, whether it is or not. But it declines to get dull.
* Every week sees the same great volume of general business,
with the railroads taxed. to their utmost capacity to handle allthe
goods tendered them for transportation and showing< earnings of
o to 7 per cent over the corresponding period last year. Unless
the usual winter lull makes its appearance very soon there will be
none this year, for in a few weeks the spring demand for merchan
dise will set in.
The retail holiday business bf the country is reported away
above any previous year, as the people seem to be remarkably flush
of cash and willing to spend it liberally. The weather has been. too
warm for the usual movement in winter goods, such as heavy
clothing and footwear, but the same warm weather has been favor
able for continued building operations, which are reported on a very
large scale. These in turn have caused a large demand for lumber
and metallic building material, so it is an ill wind that blows no
good.
The bank clearings affirm this remarkable business activity and
last week made another of their recent sensational exhibits, 'the
clearings running up to an aggregate of $3,480,000,000, with St.
Joseph the only city of the first fifty on the list to show a loss from
last year, while some of the gains among the most important cities
were large, such as 44.7 per cent at New. York, 28.9 at San Francisco,
274 at Chicago, 22 at Boston, 47.9 at Seattle, and so on. The exhibit
of these weekly clearings of late has been wonderful.
The showing of the staples is also excellent and above the
average at this time of the year. The daily records of the grain,
provision and textile exchanges of New York, Chicago and other
large centers exhibit, day after day, active markets for all lines of
factory, farm and orchard products, with prices high and firm.
New York reports more disposition among buyers of dry goods to
take hold of the market, with sellers confident of the future. Sugar,
dafry products, canned and dried fruit, hides and leather, iron and
steel and most of the minor metals, cured meats and other prepared
foods are all strong, with the markets in excellent condition for
aeHers. The cotton market has continued active, with frequent
wide floctuations due to the uncertainty in regard to the size of the
crop engendered by the different estimates of the Southern ginners'
associations and the Government bureaus. The Southern cotton
planters have united in bodies here and there to maintain prices of
the raw goods and have been successful, so that, as one report from
New York puts it, cotton is still king. The failures for the week,
m spite of the collapse of the three Walsh banks at Chicago, which
was not due to unfavorable business conditions, but the operations
of the principal stockholder, were only 226, against 251 last year.<|;
The leading feature of the week, aside from the Chicago bank
failures, was the continued active, speculation in Wall street stocks,
the wave. of investment for temporary and permanent profits being,
termed "irresistible." In vain the banks are protesting against this
wild plunging in the stock market, which is not only maintaining the
already high prices for railroad and industrial stocks, but carrying
many of them to still higher ievels, while a seat has just been sold
on the Stock Exchange for $92,000, \Vhich beats the record. The
public will listen to no advice from "the banks or any other source.
The daily sales on the exchange continue to. range from 1,000,000
to 1.800.000 shares daily, and even the drastic restraint of -very -high
money rates interposed by the banks to check the enthusiastic buy
ing has failed of its purpose. The banks and other powerful financial
interests, however, are making the best of the opportunity presented
by the public purchasing. Stocks, according to the best posted
Wall street authorities, are steadily passing from strong injto ; weak
hands. In other words, the large holders of securities, finding their
efforts to check the tide of speculation futile, are quietly unloading
their great holdings at the high quotations and making rich profits
thereby, and very. soon it will be seen that the public are carrying
most of the stocks and that the vast controlling interests are out
of the game with millions of profits in their pockets and the stocks
very neatly unloaded upon the public. The latter will have no
ground for complaint, for they have been fully admonished to let
the market alone at the ruling high prices. It is a case of a runaway
horse which refuses. to be stopped. .
Conditions on" this coast remain the same. General trade is
still active, with high prices for almost all coast products main
tamed. Building operations in all of the three 55tates. continue .very
active. More rain and warmer weather are needed to insure large
crops and give us green feed, which is very backward this year on
account /of the prolonged dry and cold weather. This, however, is
the only adverse condition on the coast at present, and we are going
out of 1005 and into 1906 with colors flying and everybody cheerful
and confident of another good year.
CANADA'S NEW TARIFF.
THE plan of a "maximum and minimum" tariff law- is- said to
be sure of adoption in some form by the Canadian Parliament.
The High Commission which has been at work on the
Dominion tariff has had quite a problem before it to. find a wav
to give more protection to dissatisfied Canadian manufacturers and
at the same time continue to favor Great Britain at the expense of
the United States and Germany. Their solution is to-be a sort
of threefold tariff law which is to be submitted , to Parliament.
The highest charge will be against those countries which' are hard
on Canadian goods, and these are especially the United States and
Germany. There will be a lower charge for those countries which
give no serious reason for retaliation. The third, and lowest, will be
the British preferential.
If the proposed law goes into effect it will have considerable
influence, on American exporting interests. Canada has already
had some experience in these wars of commercial retaliation, for
Germany has struck back at her vigorously. A study of the sub
ject made by Burton L. Read, in Moody's Magazine, shows the
very complicated position in which Canada is placed by virtue of
her family relationship with Great Britain. The preferential she
allows to the mother country really amounts to a gift. Canada at
one time gave to Germany the same tariff terms as to; Great; Britain.
When Canada terminated that treaty Germany retaliated- with an
exclusion of Canada from: the most favored nation clause, and
Canada fought, back with a surtax on German goods of 33 1-3 per
""teat. Germany then put the same tax on Canadian exports.
It is a curious fact that Canada's action in favoring Great Bri
tain's goods more than American has not injured us to the extent
which might have been expected. There are so many natural
advantages possessed by this country that the Canadians continue
to trade with us and our trade there has increased much more
rapidly than *he British. In the period from 1897 to 1905 our
trade grew. from $58,500,000 to $163,000,000, while the British rose
in the same period only from $32,900,000^0 $60,000,000. This is
liinly due to geographical, unity,' close communication, prompt de
cry and the enterprise of American merchants'/
While we can probably afford to safely count on these natural
wers enabling: us to control a large share of Canadian trade; it
mid be w^Jl to remember that Canada is said to be willing to
encourage friendly trade relations with this country and that con
servative opinion there opposes any action so "; radical as would
jeopard the prospect of mutually beneficial tariff schedules. If our
trade* is now' large fit may grow still larger by being friendly and
avoiding any of those retaliatory laws such as put a surtax of 33 1-3
per cent on the mutual trade between Germany and the Dominion.
This Government doesn't need so many men who are willing; to die for
has it does, of those who are willing to live for if.â Dallas News.

Protest of
a Husband
Angela Morgan
A HUSBAND protests that I am" not
fair to the men in laying chiefly
upon them the blame for lack of
romance in married life.
.1 "The fault in a great many instances
is the woman's," he maintains. "It
happens only too often that -by nag
ging and pouting and complaining,
wives are themselves responsible for
the destruction of happiness in mar
riage.
, "Women lay to: much stress on llttlo
things. They are too Imaginative and
auspicious. They are always , referring
to the happiness of courtship and blam
ing their husbands if they don't pay
them the same attentions.
"A woman is selfish and egotistical
to expect that her . husband has , time
for such foolishness. The chief busi
ness of a married man is to provide
for his wlfe.and'if he is kind and con
siderate in the bargain she ought ".to
be satisfied "without foolish sentiment.
You have told the men their duty and
mado plain their mistakes. Now, tell
the wives where they fail."
The writer is evidently one of the
"sensible" kind that fall to take any
but the practical view of life and love.
He does not see that by his own
-words he has condemned himself ; that
when he dismisses as "foolish" the
tender joys and delights of courtship
he confesses himself unaualifled to
make a. just estimate of the situation.
My dear sir. unless a woman la ex
ceptionally unreasonable, selfish and
childish, she does-not complain of neg
lect without cause. The trouble with
so many of your sex Is. that you do
not ; get the woman's . point of view.
You attempt to solve herproblem by
your own rules.
A, wife is neither selfish nor egotisti
cal'when she resents: a husband's in
difference to the finer obligations and
courtesies of marriage. That she
should Insist upon his observing them
is by no means an evidence of a too
exacting disposition.
No woman with any , ideality . is sat
isfied to be loved with a love that rec
ognizes only, the practical, the material
side of life.
A wife ;iays stress upon the 'little
things" because they, are an Indica
tion of the quality of her husband's
love. If *it remains * deep, . springing,

THE HIRED GIRL LEFT.
THE first we had was Mary Ann, a
literary lass.
Who used to read "The Maiden's
Doom: or,. How She Went to Grass."
And other chastely luring books the while
the beefsteak burned.
Till Lillian said somewhere she'd heard
that c'en a worm had turned;
And so she spoke to Mary Ann, with Â»en
tle words and low.
And said we'd like our beefsteak cooked
r soma two hours less or so-
Then the hired girl left!
Just two days later Norah cams, *nd with
her came a cop,
As well as Michael. Peter, Paulâ l guess
I'll have to stop,
Because I never learned the names of
half of those who wooed.
But they werÂ© fond of Norah, *nd were
also fond of food.

hoped, perhaps.

SWEET DREA3I OF MARRIAGE.
I heard you remark, Horatio, that the
married life which you are about to essay
will be one long, sw^et dream. Probably
you are right, my boy. and I sincerely
trust that you are, but then, again, the
dream might turn out to be a long, dis
mal nightmare, for it Is very difficult to
order one's dreams In advance, you know.
Look at the divorce courts; there are
trotted out and exhibited the dreams that
got bogged and lapsed into nightmares,
you know.
Ah, but it cannot be so with you, you
say, for the girl whom you are about to
marry is a perfect angel. I believe you,
for there is a time in almost every wo
man's life when she is an angel â to one
man. She remains so for a few days,
more or less, and then, out of the frills
and furbelows that adorn her, creeps
some of that Innate cussedness which Is
a part of the human inheritance of us al!,
andâ well, she makes the queerest angel,
I suppose, that ever got outside of Para
dise.
So It will be with your angel, in some
degree. Some morning, fine or otherwise,
after you are married, she will get out
of the wrong side of the bed, and you will
be shocked and pained to hear the ex
pressions of 'her opinion of things. Then,
If you have happened to get out of the
wrong side of the bÂ«d. too, . the signal
service bureau ' probably will report.
"About this time look but for storms and
squally weather"; and, whether It does or
not, you may pretty safely bet a week's
salary that they will come. There may be
exceptions to this rule, but I do not recol
lect to have observed any.
Then, again, think of an angel living
with you or me! I don't know how it
would be with you, but I would be will
ing to speculate four bits that I would get
hold of her halo and either lose or irre
trievably tarnish it within a week. No,
I desire no angel to live with me, nor
should you. I think too much of angels.
Still, if you treat the dear girl all right,
I fancy that she will treat you the same;
and I don't know that any of us have any
right to ask any more than that. Let us
all do that, and even the most pessimistic
astrologlst will find no divorce In our hor
oscope.

IS NOT MAETERLINCK'S.
Belgian Dramatist
Loses in the Ren
dering.
Honors Are Won by
John Glendenning
as Guido.
â¢ The Grand Opera-house twice full, yes
terday afternoon and evening, saw the
first Maeterlinck play, as Miss Nance
O'NÂ«H and her " company see it. the
"Monna Vanna." They were Christmas
<3ay audiences, well dined, well lined,
Christmas busy and careless of their en
tertainment. Maeterlinck has few high
notes for the actors, but these, when
.reached, elicited only a sleepy applause
last Bight. Ncr were the players them
selves In best trim. Miss O'Neil herself
toeing evidently somewhat tired by her
liercic tasks of the last two days. Neither
1 play, players nor audience can thereforo
be Justly Judged by last night's perform
ance.
It Bettled, however, the question as to
whether the policeman should be called
In. London, that stanas for "La Tosca,"
\u2666ensored "Monna Vanna" out of town.
Tft*- famous "cloak scene," where Mcnna
Vacna goes to Prlnzlvalle's tent Godiva
clad but for her cloak, was short on
chock hereâ shorter than it should have
been.
.â¢ For this is hardly the "Monna Vanna"
ef which one had dreamed. Grateful, in
dubitably, one should be to Miss O'Neil
ifor her admirable enterprise in producing
the play. Grateful, too, one should be
for what was done* with It. But, what
ever else the production proved, it proved
that Maeterlinck is as difficult to play as
"taost of Ibsen Is easy, that beyond brain
and body the actor must bring his soul
â¢to It, and that he must first possess that
kind of soul. And the indications last
jÃlght were all that Miss O'Neil herself
| -was out of her metier. Superb in picture
and in pose, the "feel" of the thing, the
particular poetry and passion were be
yond, above, afar from her. Guldo, most
unfortunately for the balance of the play,
\u25a0was by much the best-acted role, John
"Glendenning, the actor, granted. It Is
the easiest role. Its viewpoint the famil
iar, the conventional one, Mr. Glehden
' ring's work was still most admirable.
â¢ And because Guido so typifies the con
ventions, and because for them last night
he so magnetized sympathy, and because
Marco, type of the psychic freedom,
played like an auctioneer, things went
mightily awry.
TheÂ»-e '.s no hope for this Marco. Mario ;
Marjeroni does him. He comes at first,
you remember, with word of Prinzlvalle's
proposal^ that Prinzivalle will, if Guido's
\u25a0wife be sent to his tent without other i
irarb than her cloak, send corn, wine, oil, i
arms to the starving Plsans. Mr. Mar-
Jercnl presented Prinzivalle's proposition
es if it -were an over-due laundry bill and
throughout failed to give the slightest !
hint of the dignity, the majestic mystic I

wisdom of the old man. Naturally Miss
O'Ncil's scenes with him suffered. - So
she also suffered in her scenes with
Prinzlvalle to some degree.
It is easy for the actor to get lost
in a Prinzivalle. What he is, hi? valor,
his beauty, his magnificently brutal and
imaginative proposition to the Pisan
Governor, form a large part of the con
versation in the first act. It would
need a kind of Adonis, Dante and an
Alexander combined to nil the bill. Mr.
Andrew Robson Is none of these. One
could survive the first few moments
of Almost inevitable disappointment.
One did. But barring a p'asslng illusion
In the scene with Trivulzio â a magnifi
cent bit carrying largely by its own
weight, and the rest by the excellent
Trivulzio â Mr. Robson contributed only
a walking gentleman to the picture.
But perhaps he. too. was tired.
But to Monna Vanna. One groat
weakness the play has, as absolutely
dependent upon the actress for its dis
guise as it is necesary to the plot â
Monna Vanna's swift change of heart
in the barbarian's tent. The first
act finds Vanna, swept into an ecstacy
of pity for the starving Plsans, telling
Guldo of her determination to go to
Prinzivalle's tent. Like the martyrs
at the stake the exaltation of sacrifice
has numbed the sense of pain. Guido's
miserable suspicions, his insults, fall
alike unheeded upon her ear. She
listens like a pitying angel. Her mood
is still much the same when she
reaches the tent. But once In the tent,
the consciousness of the delicately bred
and beloved woman of her terrible sit
uation should surely make itself felt.
Miss O'Xeil hardly suggests this. Soon
enough .lUaeterlinck demands that Vanna
shall show interesujn the noble barbarian
â he has admirably, by contrast, prepared
for its naturalness by Guido's degrading
suspicions of her motives. But it is
with an almost immediate coquetry that
Miss O'Neil (Vanna) treats this Prinzi
valle. There is no painting of the conflict
of emotion, no depicting of the gradual
change from the woman delivered unto a
barbaric lust and the woman who hears,
strangely, from this man who has loved
her all his life the truth and poetry sung
by her own soul. The scene lacks lift,
climax, variety, and above all, subtlety.
Better Is the last act. In which Varma
takes Prinzivalle to Pisa, there to tell
her incredulous husband of his nobility.
But it is by no means, as last night en
acted, one of Miss O'Neil's fortunate
roles â only as to picture. "Royal" is the
only word that expresses that side of the
O'Xeil "Monna Vanna."
The staging and costumes of the piece
compel high praise, and no one interested
In the drama can afford to miss the
play, which will probably be much better
played by to-night.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Colombia.
William H. Crane was back in town
last night with a new play, "The Am
erican Liord," at the Columbia Theater.
The play is a success and the comedian
is still more of a success. Ho was
simply delicious in the part of the
American self-made man . and town
builder, who, having an English title,
goes to the tight little island to demol
ish it and rebuild it American fashion.
He has a daughter, too, who, played by
Miss Rosalind Coghlan, also is delicious
â a dainty dark-haired American who
pirouettes on her heel and captures a
young English lord. And he has a son
who, although not delicious, falls in
love and elopes with an, English girl
that is delicious â a blonde rose of Al
bion, who shows white teeth as she
enunciates, and rolls her r's at the end
of her tongue. She is played by Miss
Xellie Malcolm. And he has a negro
servant, played" capitally by Harry
Blakemore. Also he falls in love' with
a widow, a widow full of wit and fun.
and with a beautiful Irish accent, who
Is most charmingly represented by Miss
Hilda Spong. The whole company, In
fact, is good, but Crane, of course, has
them all beaten a block.
The play is a light comedy, almost a
farce, and ripples with laughter from
first line to last drop of curtain. The
climax of the third act is especially
good. The fourth and last act comes
near to being an anti-climax, from
some sentimental, would-be serious
clap-trap in its beginning, but picks up
at the end and finishes with an up
roarious scene between Crane and his
Widow. â¢ ;\u25a0Â£\u25a0â¢-\u25a0Â»;
Alcazar.
A little girl not yet in her teens drew
a house crowded to the walls last
night and electrified the oldest play
goers with the ease and excellence of
her acting through four acts and a
double partj at that. Little Ollie Cooper
is the bright particular star who shone
last night alternately in rags and silks
as Tom Canty, the thief's son, and
Prince Edward of England, in Mark
Twain's charming story "The. Prince
end the Pauper." Those who have reaa
the book or who have seen the play
know that there is not a dull moment
In either. As performed by the Alcazar
company it Is better than the book, for
the characters are there In flesh and
blood. Of course the prince and the
pauper being the star part, there is
not much left for the company to do
but to speak their lines and behave
themselves, but such parts as allowed
of acting at all were well done. Notably
Mr. Waldron's Miles Hendon. Edith
Evelyn's "Mrs., Canty" and John B.
Maher's "Mad Anthony," the latter an
artistic portrayal. George Osbourne,
the old favorite, had. little to do but
he made up so skillfully that his best
friends wouldn't know him.
Alhambra.
"Bob" Fitrsimmons, the hero of a
hundred battles In the ring, was the
big attraction at the Alhambra Theater
yesterday, when he played the leading
role in the drama "A Fight For Love."
Fitzsiramons has played this role so
jnany times that he is quite at ease on
the stage, and he was given the
heartiest applause by the throngs that
filled the theater. Sam Berger, the local
favorite in fistic circles, also appeared
in the play ana shared the honors with
Fltzsimmons. At the close of the play
the two men gave a three-round exhibi
tion of boxing that was spirited and
exciting. "Bob" was compelled to make
a speech at the end of the third act.
Henry Shumer, James Corrigan, George
P. Webster. Edna Ellsmere. Lillian El
liott and Clair Sinclair were in the cast
of "A Fight For Love" and gave their
usual finished performance. Edna Ells
mere returned to the Alhambra after
a short vacation and received a hearty
welcome. The production of "A Fight
For Love" was realistic and showed
great care on the part of the manage
ment. "".The .heavyweight champion,
Jack O'Brien, attended the performance
and gave the pjayers hearty encores.
California.
The Broadway Gaiety Girls, sparkling
as the lightest cfiampagne. opened at
the California Theater last night for
two hours of the merriest kind of
rollicksome fun. v Shapely bodies and
charming voices fascinated the audi
ence from the time the curtain raised
until the last song was completed. En
thusiastic applause greeted every act
The girls, and a few men, although the
men played a very minor part, acted
James Edwin Curtln's new show, "Glit
tering Sylvia,", or "The Bottom of tho
Sea." Frantic applause g-reeted every
turn. The bill continues all week.

EGGS NEARLY
CAUSE MURDER
Difference in Price on Bills
of Fare for Barnyard
Product Makes Trouble
BIG WEAPON IS DRAWN
Lack of Lucre in Pocket
of Hungry Carpenter Ends
in His Going to Prison
John Wilson, an aged carpenter who re
cently arrived in this city out of work,
had an altercation with a restaurateur on
Hayes street last night. \
Three eggs, the price .' of . which has
scared skyward of late, were the Innocent
cause of all the* trouble,, and Wilson
pines in a cell at the City Prison on a
charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
Wilson, Christmas dinner visions flitting
through his mind,, wandered .; about the
city scanning posted bills of fare to find
some edible article which would fit. his
sole wealth, 20 cents. In the course of
his travels the carpenter paused in his
hungry flight.- His eye- caught a bill of
fare posted on the window of the chop
house of one George Spero at 8 Hayes
street. Perusing the contents of the
score card, Wilson observed, "Eggs 20
cents, with coffee." "Eureka," quoth the
carpenter, "atMast I eat." L " ' ',
Wilson sauntered Into Spero's establish
ment and flopped into a wooden chair
with the air. of one possessed of the
"filthy." Adam and Eve in midoceanf
sunnyside' up. Throw Cain in," bawled
the waiter. ."Shipwreck the bunch," cor
rected the dishslinger, as Wilson
changed his desire from three fried soft
to three scrambled.
The precious barnyard product was
hurled at the customer. "Draw one
black." added the knight of the apron.
Wilson ate his Christmas fill, and his
gaze fixed on the table bill of fare saw
that three eggs, â¢ inside, cost 25 cents.
Not in the least ' nonplused, Wilson
strode to the counter and planked down
his 20.
Slavonian vernacular in strengthened
terms made the air buzz in the little chop
house. Spero seized a bottle and would
have brained his customer had not Wil
son drawn a revolver.
Policeman Robl arrested the unfortu
nate carpenter and booked him at the
City Hall station for assault with a dead
ly weapon.
ESIEIIGKtfCY SURGEONS ARE
VERY BUSY WITH MANY CASES
Christina* Festivities Result In Acci
dent* to Men With
"Packages."
The staff at- the Central Emergency
Hospital was kept busy Christmas eve
and yesterday. In all seventy-five
cases were treated between 5 o'clock Sun
day night and 11 o'clock last night.
Fully fifty more cases received atten
tion at the branch emergency hospi
tals in the space of thirty hours.
Nine-tenths of the cases treated were
primarily due to too much Christmas
"cheer."
Package after package wandered
Into the hospital. Some came on foot,
some in patrol wagons, and others rode
in the ambulance. Almost every one
had a package of yuletide cheer in his
possession. - - ' , \u25a0
No one on duty in the hospital got
any sleep Christmas eve and morning.
Bandages and other surgical parapher
nalia were used in profusion, and many
a drunk was sent on his way rejoicing.

A WOBI.U WONDER THAT
ECXIPJSES OUR NIAGARA
The Victoria Cataract on Zarabrst
River la like No Other Falls
on Earth.
The Zambesi Valley for a hundred
miles or more in every direction from the
eatfaraet, Is a rough and broken plateau,
covered with low bruÂ«h and stunted
trees, with here and there an outcrop
of somber basaltic rock, all thoroughly
uninteresting. The herbage is but faintly
green, and the tropical sky only faintly
blue. It is a hazy, half tone landscape,
wanting in clear-cut lines in every direc
tion, and lacking above everything else
that element we unconsciously seek in
a nature pictureâ life. The absence of
this produces in the mind a feeling of
' loneliness and otten of fear. Across this
solemn scene appears a river thai In flood
time ii perhaps half a mile wide. If a
d<-a! man were following down one of its
banks he v ould notice little but the quiet
water and the odd looking column of
smoke ahead. As this column was ap
proached he would expect to see the river
bank bending and the water flowing away
â¢to one side of thÂ«r conflagration, and
might glance to the right and left to note
the diieoiion taken. But the panorama
changes as he gazes. The river is no
mure. And there, where it should be.
Is only the brown plain, as lonely, brush
J covered cn^ monotonous as ever. One
must po twenty miles further before the
vanished water and the surface of the
la ml :i2a in fymmingle. before It will be
.possible to walk along the bank In com
pany with the river. So sudden and
siartling iÂ« the transformation.
Meanwhile the pillar of smoke has re
solved itself into a dense rrlst forced up
ward in terrin'c puffs from a yawning
Bash stretched dirdectly across the bed
of th*Â» river. This fearful abyss is every
Focond swallowing thousands of tons of
j?rcen-and-white water and belching up
blasts of mist that rise hundreds of feet
into the air and hurry away with the
winds as if rcjo!c:ng at their escape from
tho inforno below. And somewhere, near
ly four hundred feet below, the entrapped
rivr !s lighting its way between sheer
wnHs of black rock toward a narrow
â¢cleft. Jn the eastern wall, whence it es
capes, foaming and boiling, through the
zigzags and curves of a <3eep gorge lead
ing oft" to the eastward. One goes to an
edsc of this delivery chasm and looks
down upon the tossing waters, ever
pres-sÂ«d from behind by other floods
snuggling out of the narrow black gate
way, and perhaps the most prominent
mental sensation is that of thankfulness
ihat even in such a grim and ghastly
way nature has provided a means by
WrhJcb the fearful slit of a throat above
that has swallowed the stream can dis
frorsr- H again without causing an over
whelming catastrophe.
The Victoria cataract should be visited
*al icaM twice before one is competent to
pass an opinion upon it. When the river
Is in fiood (July) the scene Is simply ter
rible. One scop nothing but an enormous
sheet of water disappearing into the
bowels of the earth, with a noise as of
mountains falling upon one another,
while from the awful gash comes back
in li.-cc gusts and swirls the foaming
Vrenth of the tortured element below.
But in December, when the water is low,
the ciipe of the cataract shows as a long,
creamy Jilm of lovely laic; the rising mist
flows softly ?way through the little rain
forest below the caverns lip; the gigan
tic vault itself becomes 3 wonderful spec
tacle, a droair. of neutral tints, a cave
of bcauiy. Tnr down in its dark depths
the waters, sliding along the rocky walls,
and bonding gracefully around the cor
ners toward the narrow outlet, pass gayly
and laughingly to freedom. For a time
the demon of U â¢>, cataract is sleeping.â

Appendlr?:!* and Grape*.
At tills season millions of Americans
eat gr:iT>".<, seeds and pulp together,
with little thought of appendicitis or
any other danger. Thousands use them
with care to reject the seeds for fear
they may make trouble for the curious
and apparently useless, vermiform ap
pendix. An unknown but surely large
; number deny themselves the whole
some and pleasant fruit of the^- vine
because they have a more or less defi
nite Idea that risk to life and bodily
vigor lies in its juicy globes
Meanwhile hundreds of millions of
the people of s Europe and Asia
the Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese,
Greeks, French, Germans, Austrians,
llnngarians, Turks and Persiansâ eat
If rapes to an extent uncommon -In
America. If they suffer as often from
appendicitis as the most careful people
of this country there are- no % records
which indicate such conditions. The
wclgrht of evidence. clearly acquits the

Lifter Ventura Ar
rives From the
Antipodes.
Samoan Volcano Is
Still Spouting
, Lava.
Flow From Crater
Covers Several
Miles.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's liner
Ventura arrived yesterday from the An
tipodes. She made port just In time "to
pass quarantine, and the Federal doctors
gave her quick dispatch, for they, as well
as the passengers, had Christmas dinners
awaiting: them ashore. The Ventura
brought 158 passengers and Â£232 tons of
cargo. She was 6 days 22 hours and 6
minutes coming from Honolulu.
According to the passengers who ar
rived on the Ventura, the volcano on the
island of Savaii, in the Samoan group, is
still in vigorous activity. The glare from
the crater at night is visible at sea many
miles away and the lava has covered an
area of thirty square miles. This molten
flow has filled eleven miles of a deep val
ley and Is heading for the seashore. Na
tives whose homes are near the beach are
preparing to abandon their huts and co
coanut groves at short notice.
Among the passengers from Australia
was Jessie MacLachlan, the Scottish
singer, who, with her company, has been
touring the colonies. The Westminster
Abbey Glee and Choir Company of Lon
don was also on board the liner and on
Christmas eve contributed generously of
their talent to a concert held In the liner's
saloon. The concert was followed by a
Christmas tree. Surgeon G. W. Clark of
ficiated as Santa Claus.
A. J. Campbell, Treasurer of the Terri
tory of Hawaii, came -on the liner from
Honolulu with ?750,000 of Territorial
bonds. The sale of these bonds was con
summated in New York by Secretary At
kinson and Treasurer Campbell is going
to close the deal by delivering them.
The .Ventura brought from Honolulu
the body of Passed Assistant Surgeon
Lewis of the United States cruiser Chi
cago, who died at Honolulu of apoplexy.
While the Ventura was at Sydney five
large North German Lloyd steamers were
there, loading wool and grain for Europe.
Two days after leaving Auckland, on
December 9, the Ventura met her sister
ship, the Sierra, and the vessels passed
so close to each other that faces could be
plainly distinguished. Fine weather was
encountered all the way across the Pa
cific.
The passengers included the following:

Driven Front Palo Alto.
Nicola Tione is an Indian and he "'Â»nts to
go back to Alaska, or to some country whrre
there is no Christmas. Nicola was brought
from Ugashak a few months ago by Captain
Williams of the bark Coalinga. who, when not
plowing the seas, devotes his attention to till
ing" the soil oÂ£ his ranch at Palo Alto. The
skipper gave Nicola a job on the farm and
Nicola found happiness in the dally toll, for,
unliko most Indians and many whites. Nicola
loved work for Its own sake. This Is a busy,
season on the Palo Alto ranch and ordera were
ls&ued the other day that all hands would have
to work on Christmas day. Indignation meer
ings were held. A petition of pretest was
drawn up. Every farr.l hand signed lt but
Nicola. He refused po'.nt blank to have any
thing to do with it tnd declared that If he was
atked to work on Christmas day he would do so.
This was more than the farm hands could
stand. Taking tbelr cue from the students of
Stanford University they declared a boycott
against Nicola. Later they decided that this
was not sufficiently vigorous. , They would
rough-house him, and they did.
When Nicola reached Henry Peterson's boat
house yesterday he vowed he had | run all the
way from Palo Alto, and that the. whole popu
lace of that suburb was a: his heels. He will
not tviurn, he says, and will leave this land
of Christmas, boycotts and rough-house at the
first opportunity.
Wanted Old Glory I>ovrered.
Peter Llndquist. Helge Hammerstett and
Charles Lewin are sailors and exiles from Scan,
dinavia. They realized yesterday, when around
ihtm on every hand they witnessed a happy
people celebrating Chrlstman, that they were a
long way from home. They paid a man In a
white apron, to fill long, thick glasses, which
they emptied as they discussed the superiority
of the Norseman's land over this country to
which they had been lured by cruel fate. In
the chape of more wages In a week than they
cculd earn In the old country In a month or
two. They decided to Â«=:)cnri the rest of the
day at the Scandinavian Sailors' Home at the
corner of Drumm and Commercial streets, di
rectly oppoilte the Harbo,- Police Station. They
wanted to be where the soft melody \u25a0. of their
native tongue would fall on Uuir ears and
bring comfort to their homesick hearts. Above
the door of the Home Waved the flags of Nor
way and Sweden. From a pole on the roof
fluttered Old Glory. They gazed at the flags
of their home-land and were Just beginning to
cheer when Llndqulsi righted the stars and
Ftrtpes flying high above the allert flags. With
a whocp, oi rage thÂ» trio marched Into the
clflce of the Horn* and demanded that the
Scandinavian flags be hoisted above the Ameri
can flaÂ«r. The fair haired clerk laughed and
playfully told them to go and "yump In the
bay."
â¢ They Â»hmanderi the addresses of .the Consuls
of Norway and Sweden.
Once more th^ blonde-locked cl<>rk laughed.
Then began a rough house which threatened
to break up the Scandinavian Sailors' Home
Christmas t-ckbrallon.
Policeman Henneberry arrived when the ex
citement* was at its height; and after a sharp
tu??le chained the three homesick Scandinavians
together and herded them to the Harbor Police
Station, where they were locked up on a charge
of disturbing the peace.
The f?tan< and stripes never stopped waving.

Fuller and â¢ Warner both played [ the balls
hard and ' > were"" anything but" steady.
Murphy also' put considerable; speed into
his strokes. .
Errors were rather numerous, but were
morc'of ten made by the losers.
An impromplv handicap singles tourna^

AVhat Eloquence Costs.
A Belgian statistician has amused
himself , by calculating the cost to his
country of parliamentary oratory, and
that of 'noise, and even of: silence in
parliament; for/according to him; each
second of a sitting costs the same
amount, arid silence is paid for, during
the sittings, as dearly as speeoh. He
calculates that each hour of the sit
tings of the Belgian chamber costs
$1457, each minute $24.28, and each
second something more than 40 cents.'
- Starting from this basis he calculates
that the words of the president at the
opening of each sitting, "Gentlemen,
the sitting has commenced," cost about
$1. .' A laugh, .for which, when uttered
in his presence, he could find no reason,
wns. timed by him to cost J1.25.
"Marks of approval on many benches"
cost as much as $10 or $16; a suitable
"prolonged' movement" cannot be pro
duced at less than $20 or $25. "Ironical
cheers at the left" are exceedingly
costly, while "loud approval at the
right" runs to a price beyond all rea
son. ,
He- notes that a few days ago the
applause from the government benches
at the end of a speech of the railway
minister cost exactly $13.09, and that a
sitting of three hours, which was oc
cupied by three indifferent speakers,
cost close on to $5000. Patti could be
heard in Brussels for such a sum. he
declares; or grand opera, claque and
all, be had for less!â Chicago Tribune.
OrlÃln of Liveries.
The wearing of liveries dates back
to the days of gentle: service, when it
was the custom for Kings to deliver
splendid habits to the members of their
households. In days of chivalry^ a
Duke's son would -wear the livery of
his Prince, an esquire. that of a knight;
and it was' not until modern times that
the word took on its present use.
Liveries were gradually suppressed
at the close of the middle ages, partly
on account, of the cost of providing
them in Increasing quantities, and
partly because the growing. households
of liveried retainers became a menace
to the King's peace. â Exchange.

A RECORD RUN
Tortes of Sherman Indians
Carries Bali 107 Yards for
a Remarkable Touchdown
TWO PLAYERS INJURED
â -.-^-..^
St. Vincent's Eleven Badly
Routed in Final Content
of Southern California
. LiOS ANGELES, Dec. 23.â Two serious
casualties, Â«omc spectacular playing, in
. eluding a run cf 107 yards, said to be the
ltngest in ihc- history of football, were
the features of the last gridiron game of
the season in Southern California to-day
between the Sherman Indians and SIT
>meer.fs College, which was won by the
former by the score of 30 to 0.
li. Wllhoot cf St. Vincent's sustained
a broken collarbone and L. Lrtigo of the
Indians had two ribs Emashed. The In
. dians outplayed the local men from the
start, although the score at the end of
the first half was closeâ Â« to 0. After the
second half opened the Indians playÂ«-d
â¢ Tvith great speed and determination, an'l
1 their superior weight counted for much
against ih.eir opponents.
On the kickorr at the beginning cf the
second half Andreas for St Vincent's
kicked to the Indians' three-yard line.
â¢â¢Juries received the ball and started for
tho return run. In the face of aggressive
: Â«?nd â¢ repeated tacUlcs. but supported by
the must sploncid sort of interference, he
carried the bail across the field and got
completely through the St. Vincent line.
Tf.en. with a clear field, he made a final
'*i,urt for a touchdown, with the whole
fit Id ;n pursuit. He gained it easily, and
tapped his remarkable performance by
: kicking a -perfect goal. The St. Vincents
*<?re disheartened after this play and the
Jrsiians scored three more touchdowns
Â»:th ease. Xeafus, the star of the In
csan team, was not on the* field to-day.

GAME LITTLE "ST. LOUIS HORSE WHO EASILY OUTRAN- PROPER AND DR. LEOGO IX THE MAIN EVENT YESTERDAY
AT THE INGLESIDE TRACK, AND A SECTION OF THE GAY CR<SWD IN THE GRANDSTAND JUST BEFORE VIC
TQR CAME UNDER WIRE.- ,
Great Holiday Throng Bets Recklessly
on the Events at Ingleside.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
\u25a0 , ~ \u25a0 \u25a0 . ' - - \u25a0 " "
Lubin, a 10 to 1 shot, with Treubel in
the saddle.' defeated Proper for the
Christmas handicap at Ingleside track
yesterday with such ridiculous ease that
it looked as if the giant horse from the
Jennings stable might have. been trudg
ing along in the Erie-cahal boat service.
The result was bitterly disappointing td
the big holiday throng, and an immense
crowd ,lt assuredly was. Aa a' general
rule, the, visionary newspaper man. has no
compunctions in stating .that twenty
thousand saw Luke McGlook smash glass
balls with wooden boxing gloves when
two thousand would, answer as well. But
at a conservative estimate 8000 persons,
San Francisco reckoning, viewed the out
sider's unexpected victory.
As on all of his previous unsuccessful
essays, the palm was handed to Proper
before he had won It. Allotted 134
pounds, the big fellow ran coupled in the
betting with Nigrette, and the pair closed
at 13 to 20. Lubln had 107 pounds to nego
tiate and/hl3 price went from 6 to 10. Dr.
Leggo remained a 6 to 1 chance* it being
the \u25a0 craclc three-year-olds first appear
ance this season, and besides 118 pounds
looked ample to shoulder. Callaghan,, the
added starter, piloted by Radtke, came in
for steady backing at 13 to 5.
With only /=a .trifling delay, Jake Hol
man the 'sextet away to a good
start. Proper, showed : first, but Callaghan
almost Immediately assumed the leading
position. For nearly' a' mile the Nealon
speed consumer showed ; heels to the
bunchi and then they closed on him.
PROPER PASSED BY XiVBIN.
For an instant Proper, led as the field
made* the v bftnd for the wire, -and the
hopes of 'the favorite's backers rose^ high,
only- to drop just' as "quickly. Treubel

: Him When He Took Oath
' Yesterday web a comparatively un
ej-entful day in thÂ« life of George D.
Collins, who was recently on trial for
alleged perjury, and about whose guilt
the jury disagreed. The late defendant
spent the sweater pa rt of the day en
joying hiÂ» rest. He put In an hour,
however. In preparing affidavits for
the Judge,. In which axe embodied re
quests for citations for various per
tins connected with his recent prose
cVitidn, and he demands their punlsh
xnent for contempt of court. These
affidavits will be heard before Judge
Lawlor to-day.
Collins declares that the failure of
\u25a0U;e recent prosecution to Â«stablleh his
grullt will result In trouble for his al
leged persecutors and that some of
them may exchange places with him
In regard to being out on balL He
sayÂ£ he will endeavor to have one of
his recent Jurors that stood for ac
culttal swear out a for the
arrest of District Attorney Bylngton
on a charge of criminal libel and that
fee personally will ask for Byington's
punishment for contempt.
Collins' resentment goes still fur
ther and his wrath now falls upon Â«x
j Juryman Moritz Cohn, for whose pun
ishment for contempt Collins will ask.
Ochn declared at the time he was
qualifying to serve for a Juror that
he had formed no opinion regarding
the case ajid could give an impartial
hearing. Collins says that D. J. Smith
ci 1946 Jackson street Is ready to
â¢wear that Oohn told him before the
was chosen that he. Cohn, ln
.aended to get on the Collins jury in
iorÂ£er to convict the defendant. In-
Qulry for Smith reveals that there Is
sjo house at the number mentioned.
â¢ Yesterday afternoon District Attor
.'ney Bylngton and Hiram Johnson, who
â¢was associate counsel for the prosecu
tion during the trial, held a long and
s*oret talk in the District Attorney's
ofllfcs at the Hall of Justice and at
Its" conclusion said that nothing of im
portance was discussed. The District
..Attorney is awaiting Collins' first move
in th*e matter of the contempt proceed
ings and says he is ready to meet the

GAS IS CHEATED
OF TWO VICTIMS
Young Girls Are Rescued
by Small Boy When Near to
Death From Asphyxiation
Two pretty girls, Yette Labling and An
nie Lande, of 639 Minna street, were as
phyxiated by gas yesterday morning.
But for the timely discovery of- their
plight by Miss Labling's little twelve
year-old brother, Alfred, the two girls
might not have spent Christmas day in
San Francisco. Both young women are
now confined to their beds, in a serious
condition as a result of the inhalation of
the poisonous fumes of carbon . monoxide."
The girls were. treated by Dr. Joseph Ar
denyl of 1020 Mission street The physi
cian says that while his patients , will be
confined to their beds for several days he
believes they will recover.
Miss Labling, who is a clerk in the New
York Cloak House, lives with her parents
at 639 Minna street. With her rooms Miss
Lande, a cashier In the employ of Rosen
thal's shoe store. Last night Miss Lab
ling went,to bed about 10 o'clock. She left
the gas burning for her roommate, Miss
Lande, who was spending the evening
out. When Miss Lande came home at
midnight she -undressed and, as she
thought, turned; off the gas. -The gas
cock works loosely. In turning out the
gas Miss Lande turned the cock so that
the light went out, then, partly on again.
The latter act was unconscious and due
to the disabled condition of the fixture.
Through the . nine hours following the
young women slept unconscious of the
leaking fluid. The carbon monoxide flow
ed slowly, else ; death' might have over
taken the sleepers before Christmas
morning dawned.
About 9 a,- m. . Albert Labling passed
down the hall In front^ of his sister's
room. He heard a noise, as though some
one , had fallen. .On going : to* the door of
his sister's room to ascertain the cause
of the noise, he smelled the gas. ' Opening
the door, he saw his sister, lying upon the
floor of her room, where she had fallen
In an attempt to leave her bed, on awak
ening. Calling wildly for help, young
Cabling dragged the two ! girls into
the hall. Dr. Ardenyiwas called' in : and
for two hours worked herolcally. ; over ; the
prostrate forms of the gas; victims.'
When seen last night at their home the
glrls^were '\u25a0 sick \ from . ' the effects, - ; but
thanked God that they were spared to see
the light of Christmas ! day. \u25a0/
Miss Labling said: ''When I: awoke; I
had been dreaming of death. "I felt weak
and faint and my Vision was distorted.
Not knowing; why, I rose "from /my .bed
and fell in a > heap on. the floor./; The feel
ing of asphyxiation ; Is not a \u25a0 bad \u25a0 one. '-. I
felt languid and weak.y^Of course "I; .was
ignorant "of : the, cause *of my.,
feeling until ;\u25a0 I (recovered: consciousness."
v Had not'Mlss Labling fallen, so that her
brother heard the noise, < both \u25a0 young wo-
men might have been dead ere their pre
dicament was discovered. Miss Labling
is 20 years of age and Miss Lande 19.

everything to live for.
The shooting took place about noon
yesterday. The rest of the family
were up ,at luncheon and Bullotti
placed the pistol in his mouth down in
the barroom. He' had. ;been drinking
heavily for several days and yester
day he was in a stolid state of Intoxi
cation. Â£
\u25a0f Bullotti had a wife ana; two little
children. One of them, the boy,jAn
