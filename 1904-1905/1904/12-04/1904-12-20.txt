OF OREGONIANS
MITCHELL AND HERMANN MUST- ACT
AS PROSECUTION DIRECTS.
Both Men in Serious Plight
UNITED STATES SENATOR AND CONGRESSMAN* FROM OREGON WHO ARE
SPEEDING WESTWARD TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST CHARGES
INVOLVING THEM IN ALLEGED CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD THE GOV
ERNMENT OUT OF LAND.
Ej*cial Dlrratch to Tbe CalL
PORTLAND. Ore.. Dec 19.âAccord
ing to information received in Portland
to-night Secretary Hitchcock has
stated that United States Senator
Mitchell and Representative Binger
Hermann have no idea of the serious
ness of the land fraud charges hang
ing over their heads. Both men are
rowing speeding toward Portland from
Washington as ' fa^t as a train can
carry them. Representative Binger
Hermann had declined to come to Port
land, but the report sent by his friends
here, apparently, that it was reported
that a confession had been made
v.hich deeply involved him. caused him
to drop public business at the Capitol
and accompany Senator Mitchell to
Portland.
It is more than probable that Francis
J. Heney, now Deputy United States
District Attorney, will not allow either
Benator Matchell or Representative
Hermann to appear before the Grand
Jury and declare their innocence, as
they have 6tated in Washington they
will do. They must wait their turn
and will 'not have a chance to talk to
the Grand Jury until the Government
prosecutors consider it proper for them
to do so.
Subpenas* were Issued for both .the
Benator and Representative, but they
refused to come. When they heard,
however, that the charges were being
made directly against them they start
ed almost immediately.
Because of his apparent connection
with the appalling Norman Williams
murders it is believed that C. E. Loo
mls, formerly a special Government
land agent, will be brought into the
land fraud case.
Norman Williams murdered Alma
Nesbitt and her aged mother in Was
co County in 1900, hiding their bodies
under a chicken-house. He Is now
under sentence of death. Loomis was
sent to investigate the claims held by
Williams and for possession of which
Williams had apparently murdered
the two women. Loomis became cog
nizant of the murders, It is believed,
and advised Williams to leave the
country. Williams h<:ld $5000 worth
of stock in a ditch company at the
time and this stock was afterward
found to have passed to Loomis.
Loomis is known to have been Bin
ger Hermann's confidential man while
Hermann was Commissioner of the
General Land Office. If it la proved
before the Grand Jury that Loomis
â was certainly aware of the facts in
the sensational Williams murder trial
be will be turned over' to the' Wasco
County authorities and tried for an
accessory after the fact.

TACOMA. Wash., Dec. 19. â After
fifteen years' search James B. McDon
ald of Cincinnati has found In the
forest at Twisp, Okanogan County,
many miles from railroads, his nine
teen-year-old ' daughter, Llllie, who
was kidnaped by two rough looking
men June 10, 1889, while playing near
her home one mile from'Plainfleld, N.
J. The kidnaping of Lillie broke up
McDonald's hftme and a year later
Mrs. McDonald died in Orange, N. J.,
from a broken heart. McDonald
moved to Dayton, Ohio, and later to
Cincinnati. He has spent a fortune in
his efforts to recover the child.
The girl was found last week as the
adopted daughter of Mrs. Mary L. Mc-
Cabe, formerly a nurse' at Bellefon
taine, Ohio. There 'Mrs. McCabe found
the child nine years ago. A merchant
of Bellefontaine in moderate circum
stances confessed to Mrs. McCabe
Cabe Just before dying with typhoid
that he and another man had kidnaped
the child six years previously. Re
forming, he had accumulated some
money and started a store. : He had
always treated the girl , well.
Mrs. McCabe 1 adopted the child, tell
ing many friends the story of her ab
duction. . This resulted In an inkling
of the truth reaching McDonald. Only
three months ago he secured his first
definite clew, and it brought him to
this State, and resulted in his finding
his daughter. Until last week neither
Mrs. McCabe or Lillie even knew, the
name of her parents.
Mrs. McCabe will give up her home*

and occupied the fort with a heavy
force. The following report of the cap
ture was telegraphed from General
Nogi's headquarters to-day:
"At 2:15 o'clock on the afternoon of

SLAVS CAUGHT NAPPING.
LONDON, Dec. 20.â According to spe
cial correspondents with the Japanese
army the capture of the Keekwan fort
was a complete surprise to. the Russian
garrison, there having been no prepara
tory bombardment. Japanese sappers
drove shafts forty feet under the par
apet of the fort, from the' escarpment
and moat. In these two tons of dyna
mite were exploded simultaneously,
completely wrecking the interior of the
fort while siege and shrapnel guns
shelled Russian troops in the vicinity.
This occurred at 2 o'clock In the
afternoon. A detachment of Japanese
infantry made a headlong but pre
mature rush and sixty of them became
buried under a mass of debris, greatly
delaying the attack. Despite this mis
chance another volunteer force dashed
forward and captured the parapet.
In the meantime the Russians had
been strongly reinforced and a fierce
hand-to-hand struggle with- bayonets
and grenades was continued until near
midnight, when the, few iiussian sur

Sermon;

ists Say His Views Are
Not Original.
Two Fresbyterian Pastors Bitterly
. Criticiza Patriarch's Rejection
of Biblical L:w.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 19.â Has Rev. Dr.
Lyman Abbott . broken away from the
Christian theology?, is .the question
clergymen of every denomination were
asking to-day. In making his views
known to Harvard students yesterday
Dr. Abbott confessed that he expected
to be branded a heretic.
"I wonder if you students in Har
vard will understand me when I say
that I no longer believe in a great first
cause?" said Dr. Abbott. "My God is
a great and ever-present force, which
Isi manifest in all the activities of man
and all the workings of nature. I be
lieve in a God who is in and through
and of everything: not an absentee
God, whom we have to reach through
a bible or priest or some other outside
aid, but a God who is closer to us than
hands or feet." . V -.,
Rev. Dr. Minot J. Savage said to
day: / "We Unitarians have been
preaching Just this sort of thing year
in and year, out, yet when some one else
comes along and saya it the public ac
claims it v something. 'new. â  That< ser
mon might have b|ej i preached by any
Vnlt*ri**v*mlnisi a, v*Â£f . the land, s ' r :. , s**s a?
Rev. Robert Coltyer alÂ»o .expressed
pleasure that. Dr. Abbott had put him-
BelX on record 1 in such a pronounced
manner. â 'â â  "^ â 
"It is an Interpretation of the heart
and head," he asserted. "The outlook
is growing brighter and brighter for
the great, good, grand fatherhood of
God." , - .
UNIVERSAL.ISTS PLEASED.
Universalists are as ready as Uni
tarians, to whom they are so closely
related, to rejoice over the broad-reve
lations expressed by Dr. Abbott.
Rev. Dr. Parkhurst was unwilling to
commit himself . to an opinion before
reading Dr. Abbott's sermon in full,
further than to say that if Dr. Abbott
had been quoted correctly he had .blun
dered in placing evolution before crea
tion, as there must be something from
which to unfold to make evolution pos
sible.
When Dr. Abbott was pastor of
.Plymouth Congregational Church in
Brooklyn several years ago, he made
a considerable stir in theological circles
by his remarks from 1 the pulpit of that
church on the. Bible story of Jonah and
the whale.
The' Congregational denomination has
slight Jurisdiction over its clergymen
and Dr. Abbott cannot be tried for
heresy In any such official manner as
would be possible in the Presbyterian,
Episcopalian or Methodist church. A
minister's own' congregation could dis
pense with his services as pastor and
ministers of other Congregational
churches could meet and agree to re
fuse him the use of their pulpits or the
privileges of 'fellowship, but that Is as
far as the punishment could go. >
DENOUNCED IN PITTSBURG.
A special from Pittsburg says that
Dr. Abbott's sermon yesterday has
caused great indignation among Pitts
burg clergymen. Rev. Dr. J. T. Me-
Crory, pastor of the Third United Pres r
byterian Church of Pittsburg and prob
ably the leading divine of that creed
to-day, said: . â¢ .
"Abbott Is an Infidel. He does not
believe in Christianity. He simply ut
ters his- true thoughts." \
"If I were to form a composite pic
ture of the devil as an agel of â¢ light
and of darkness, I could easily imagine
Lyman Abbott and Bishop Potter in
the : composite," â¢ said Rev. Dr. Wilbur
F. Crafts of Washington, D. C. who is
In Pittsburg In the interest of the Pres
byterian Reform Bureau. "While both
men are clean and probably sincere,
their Ideas work more harm to the
moral world than those of any two
men living. .1 have always found that
when a. man becomes loose on theology
he becomes loose . on ethics. Lyman
Abbott, besides; .his attacks on the
Bible, favors wine drinking and open
saloons on , Sunday."

handed down its findings in" the matter of the investigation of charges of
corruption in Chinatown. Though Commissioner Howell, in specific terms, and
Hutton, Drinkhouse and Reagan, by omission of specific statement, agreed that it

Friends of

BostoDian Aids in Forming
and Then Deserts the
- Copper Pool.
Fails to 'Respond- -Wheit -Assessment
r ~' â 'â  Is Levied for Protection
of Stock
Epecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 19.â Thomas W.
Lawson's reference to the transactions
of the pool- in Amalgamated Copper
and his statement that James R.
Keene had "washed" Copper Trust
stock In the operation of the pool,
brought out to-day in Wall street an
interesting tale of Lawson's connection
with the pool. According to this story,
which is vouched for by several mem
bers of the pool, Lawson appears in a
new role.
The pool was one of the strongest
ever formed in Wall street and was got
up for the purpose of protecting Amal
gamated Copper stock, shortly after
the formation of the company in 1899.
Lawson. was a participant.
It appears that $15,000,000 of the $75,
000,000 capital which the company had
then was allotted to the public. A few
months after the company was formed
the greater part of this stock was
thrown on the market. The Insiders
then formed a pool to support the
stock. The funds put up by the pool
members at first were insufficient to
care for the stock thrown on the mar
ket and a call was sent out to the par
ticipants for further cash. Every one
responded except Lawson.
Flower & Co.. were in Amalgamated
Copper stock at that time and were
popularly supposed to be the managers
of the pool, with James R. Keene act
ing as market operator. Flower &
Co. sent out calls to Lawson, but he
failed to respond. .
Enraged by Lawson's fulmi nations,
H. H. Rogers has started an elaborate
campaign â¢ against Lawson. He has
tried ' to stop the circulation of the
January number of Everybody's Mag
azine,' which will be placed on sale
to-morrow, and which contains an in
stallment of Lawson's "Frenzied Fi
nance'" that is particularly severe on
Rogers. His lawyers have sent, formal
notice to the American News Company^,
which acts as distributing agent for
Everybody's Magazine, notifying the
managers that they will expose them
selves to. danger, of criminal prosecu
tion if they - place the magazine on
sale. Prosecuting Attorney Jerome, on
an affidavit of Henry Wack, probably
will take steps to indict Lawson for
circulating libelous statements.
Wack did not appear to-day at
Jerome's ofllce, but sent his counsel,
Charles M. Seattle. The District At
torney created some surprise by say
ing 'that he had seen another lawyer
representing "larger and greater in
terests than those represented by Mr.
Beattie."

PRICE FIVE CENTS
Three sergeants of police and five
patrolmen must face trial before the
Police Commission to-morrow evening
as a result of the Investigation into the
charge that corruption has long stalked
through Chinatown. Thomas P. Ellis,
William F. Brophy and Philip E.
Fraher are the accu3ed wearers of the
chevrons and Henry Heinz. William
Doran, Henry T. McGrath, Charles E.
Munn and R. R. O'Brien the men of
the ranks that have been placed on
the defensive.
These men," with the exception of
Ellis, are charged with plain neglect
of duty. Ellis, on top of this charge.
is accused of willful violation of duty,
the result of Commissioner Hutton's
charge that through the manipulation
of some mysterious "high sign" by that
officer every Chinese in the city was
made aware' one night that Hutton
was abroad and that it was time to
take to cover.
The filing of these charges was the
result of the finding of the Police Com
mission in what it terms "the matter
of the Investigation of matters in
Chinatown." Though all the Commis
sioners participated in the findings, it
was Hutton who filed the charges and
on whom the burden of proof rests.
It was Hutton's original plan to
charge every policeman serving In
Chinatown since raising of the injunc
tion itrS^irtratttef-nttttTieglect of duty,
but this act would have placed even
Patrolman Mlnlhan, Hutton's aid on
the night of his memorable raid, on
the defensive. After thinking the mat
ter over Hutton decided, to let the
weight of the investigation fall on Ser
geant Ellis and his squad of police and
Sergeants Brophy and Fraher, whose
only connection with Chinatown is that
it Is included in their district north of
Market street. Ellis and his squad
were on duty in Chinatown the night
Hutton Invaded 820 and 820*4 Washing
ton street and they must explain first.
Later, Hutton says, he may call upon
the others to save their stars If they
can.
FUZE THREE REPORTS.
The Commissioners illed three re
ports. The firstâ a majority report,
bearing the signatures of Commis
sioners Hutton, Reagan and Drink
house â exonerates Mayor Schmitz and
Attorney A. liuef from any participa
tion in any corruption that may exist
in the Mongolian quarter, but is not
so kind .with the police. These Com
missioners find that though hampered
by the courts and the difficulty of
gaining entrance to the gaming places
the police have never, except in rare
instances* used proper efforts to in
sure their suppression. These Com
missioners also find that the evidence
produced In the investigation shows
that funds are raised by the gamblers
and believe that some portion of these
funds is used for corrupt purposes,
"but the final, resting place of the
money is not at this time susceptible
of legal proof." â¢ â¢/
Commissioner Howell, though shar
ing these views In the main, holds that
though he believes gambling could be
permanently suppressed In Chinatown,
he seriously questions the advisability
of stripping the beats of the city in
order to throw a great force Into
Chinatown to effect this purpose, there
by increasing the danger of other
crimes, probably of more serious im
port to the whole community than the
gambling in Chinatown.
While the Commissioners that signed
the majority report exonerate Mayor
Schmitz and Attorney A. Ruef, they
make no specific mention of Chief of
Police Wittman or other members of
the department, leaving the report
open to any construction the reader
may see fit to place %n it In this re
gard, but Commlsstone? Howell cor
rects this Innuendo In the following
language:
"I desire to say in conclusion that In
asmuch as a great deal has been said
tending to Implicate many officials and
others In the corruption believed to ex
ist that-no evidence of any kind or na
ture whatsoever has been Introduced
before this commission tending in any
I manner to dtrectly implicate any of
ficial of this city and county or of the
i Police Department, or any citizen of
j this city. In any participation in the
corruption fund."
EXONERATE CO3IMISSIOXERS.
The third report is signed by Com
missioners Hutton and Howell, and in
positive terms they find that no evi
dence was produced tending In any
way to Implicate either Commissioner
Drinkhouse or Commissioner Reagan In
the Chinatown scandal.
The majority report, signed by Hut
ton, Drinkhouse and Reagan, la "as fol

- TOKIO, Dec. % 19â Although accus
tomed to hearing of acts of bravery
on the part of their soldiers and sail
ors, ihe people of Japan have been
thrilled by the details of the series
uf desperate torpedo attacks asainst
the Russian battleship Sevastopol and
other craft driven outside the harbor
of Poit Arthur by the fire of the Jap

the attacks were planned, but he suc

elu-ll from the Sevastopol struck him
in the abdomen, cutting his body in
two. Commander Yezoe's remains
verf- brought back to the fleet. They
probably will be brought to Japan for
public interment.
Lieutenant Xakahara went to the
resÂ«ue of a disabled torpedo boat,
vhi-.ii had been under the command of
Lieutenant Xakahori, who, with five
ethers, was killed, and submitted to a
deadly lir^. Nakahara"s boat was hit
repeatedly, but he succeeded in rescu
lns a majority of the crew of Xaka
hori s boat.
More of Admiral Togo's men volun
teered for participation in the attacks
than could be assigned.
Jt it probable that Admiral Togo will
soon return to Japan, leaving a junior
admiral to conduct the final operations
and to continue the blockade. It Is ex
pected that Togo will be summoned
by the Kmperor to Tokio, where he will
be given splendid public receptions.
TOGO'S MEX EXULTANT.
Admiral Togo's campaign of ten
months is considered equal to a.ny in
tho history of naval warfare. He has
laÂ»v>red constantly under the necessity
of preserving the vessels of his fleet
fur service against the Russion Second
Pacific Squadron. The admiral and his
men have withstood storm, stress and
exposure excellently. The men are in
good health and exultant.
Telesraphins under date of December
18. Vice Admiral Togo says:
"There, is no room left to doubt that
th- cnemvs shiys in the harbor of
Port Arthur axe totally unfit for ser
vice. I have reason to believe that
the battleship Sevastopol has been dis
eb>d by our torpedo attacks, but no
definite data on which to pass fraal
judgment has yet been obtained and
investigations arc being' conducted in
all available Quarters. It is certain
that Bt '.east six Russian torpedo boat
destroyers remain intact in the har
bor."

Feared That Agitation Will
Cause the; Government to
Adopt Repressive Measures
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 19.â The
Emperor's fete ddy passed without any
untoward demonstrations in St. Peters
burg 1 , but was marked by' a continua
tion of the Moscow disorders, though
they were not as serious as on Sunday.
The feature ( of the Moscow demon
stration was the distribution of a vio
lent proclamation of the Social Demo
cratic Labor party describing the whole
country as being in a state of mourn
ing and tears fÂ»r the sacrifice of life in
the Far East for the aggrandizement
of the Romanoffs, picturing the Gov
ernment as driving people to star
vation, and calling' upon workingmen
to enter ceaselessly upon .a war for
overthrowing the tyrants'. Other dem
onstrations are reported from various
localities.
In consequence of the agitation the
advisers of Emperor Nicholas have
dissuaded him from his contemplated
trip to the south of Russia to bid fare
well to troops being dispatched to the
Far East.
As an indication of the temerity of
some of the extreme Liberals in the
campaign now waging, 108 of the lead
ing writers for Russian Fatherland,
Our Life and other Liberal papers of
St. Petersburg have openly drawn up
an indictment against the action of the
police at the demonstration in the Nev
sky Prospect on December 11.
Conservatives are afraid that the
ill-advised course of the extremists
will drive the Government to adopt re
pressive measures just when a distinct
victory over the reactionaries had been
â¢won and a liberal regime has been in
augurated. The renewed activity in
revolutionary circles already has
caused many arrests.
ROSTOFFONDON, Dec. 19.â Local
representatives of all the various ranks
of life, including workingmen and
many ladies, have held a big banquet
here at which speeches were made in
favor of imperial reform, liberty of

conclusion of the banquet resolutions
similar to those passed by the Zem

were adopted. There were no disorders

Case and Hutton Accuses Eight of Force
Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
missioners, independent of that which
was introduced bearing solely upon the
written report of Commissioner Hutton,
are that for many| years last past there
has been conducted' in the eight blocks
bounded by. Sacramento street on the
south, Paoific street. ,on th6 , north,
Stockton street on the west and Dupont
street on the east, over one hundred
places where gambling, to wit, fantan
and lottery drawings, has been contin
ually taking* place/' )\
"The existence and operations of
these places have been in violation of
the statutes of the State and some of
the ordinances of the city and (county,
and has led to numerous scandals, mur
ders and charges of corruption against
the police and other city officials.
"These places were operated with
none but police interference up to Jan
uary 28, 1904, when Wee Ong Tong,
claiming to be a corporation, com
menced an action in the Superior
Court to restrain the police from mak
ing any effortsin the direction of the
suppression of^Chinese gambling in the
above .mentioned locality.
"His Honor Judge Carroll Cook, by
injunction, restrained the police on
that day from ' further interference.
The injunction was continued' in force
from time to time by his Honor Judge
Murasky, and on the 27th day of Sep
tember, 1904, the action was dismissed
without prejudice, it developing at
that time that. Wee Ong Tong was not
a corporation and had no standing in
court.
JONG INCORPORATES.
"'Between the time of the commence
ment of that action and its dismissal
the Wee Ong Tong did incorporate, aud
on the 28th of September, 1904, it com
menced another action, and his Honor
Judge Cook issued another restraining
order. An answer was filed, the case
Set for trial, and it resulted in Judg
ment being rendered for the defend
ants, and on November 7. 1904, the in
junction was finally dissolved.
'. "The Police Department was thus
powerless to act between the 28th day
of January, 1904, and the 7th day Â«of
November, 1904.
"The evidence produced before us
shows that these concerns run with a
very large profit, and that a weekly
contribution is made to two different
funds by each of the said gambling
establishments, $5 per fan tan table
per week being paid to a concern
known as the 'See Yilps.' which we are
informed is used for the "defense of
any one charged with murder arising
out of the highbinders' war, or any
thing incidental to gambling. Another
$5 is, paid to some other fund, which
we believe to be what is commonly
known as the 'gamblers' association
fund.' The lotteries paying other
sums, the whole - aggregates a large
sum Her month. ,.-,.Â» , â  â â â¢â 
"We- are inclined 4p .think rthat the
final 'resting-place of the money is not
at this time susceptible of legal procf;
but is sealed in the minds of those ;wÂ£ho
handle it, and they will commit per
jury about its disposition .out of per
sonal interest and fear of death at the
hands of their associates, but we be
lieve some part of it is used for cor
rupt purposes.
"In April, 1903, information connect
ed with gambling was given, and we
are informed that it resulted in the
murder of a party connected with the
information by reason of rewards of
fered and we suppose paid therefor by
the eight men who control the gam
bling associations, each of whom was
charged with and one has already
been convicted of murder. The cases
of the others are still pending. One
other was put on trial, which was
stopped in its midst by the charge of
one of the jurymen that he had been
given $150 to bring in a verdict for the
defendant.
COURTS ARE. BLAMED.
"Sporadic attempts have been made
to stop the continuance of the above
gambling. We find that it has been
and can be stopped by the police when
not interfered with, by the courts with
out at all impairing police efficiency or
the detection or prevention of crime in
other parts of the city.
"That it has existed at all is a mat
ter, pf public shame and a blot on the
good . name of the city. It seams in
tolerable . tq .us that, at this stage of
civilization, where law is supposed to
prevail, the condition of affairs in
Chinatown for years past has existed.
"The evidence before us absolutely
fails . to substantiate in any degree
that either his Honor Mayor E. E.
Schmitz or Mr. A. -Ruef received any
part of the fund above mentioned' or
acquiesced in any way . at all in the
gambling in Chinatown, or that they
were, In any way connected with the
failure to suppress it.
:"We find that the reports of the ser
geants who ha^e been detailed- in
Chinatown for the last two years show
a surprising uniformity in the number
and character of arrests and the
amount of fines collected, and that
â while 95 per cent of the gambling is
carried on in â  CJhinatown by Chinese
and 5 per cent by Caucasians, still not
95 per cent of the arrests were China
men. On thÂ£' contrary, quite a^dlspro

.SQUAD IS SUFFICIENT.
"We believe that the squad kept

If it were not so sufficient it would
need but the temporary presence of a

if it required many more men it will
not do for a police department to say
that crime by the wholesale should be

cause a policeman while there sup

isolated violation of law elsewhere
where crime is but of infrequent oc

. '.'It is the plain duty of a police de
partment to prevent known violations
â of the law? A bare fear that a crime,
may be committed in one place cannot
excuse a failure to suppress known
crime by the wholesale in another.
"We are of the opinion that never,
except in ramote instances, have proper
efforts been used by the Police Depart
ment in the suppression of gambling
in Chfnatown when they have been
free to act without interference by the
courts."
HOWELL'S FINDINGS.
Commissioner Howell's report differs
from that of his associates only in the
conclusion, which is as follows:
"I believe that gambling can be ef
fectively ; and permanently suppressed
in Chinatown, but I also Relieve that a
large force of nien continually on duty
would be absolutely necessary to ac
complish this purpose. Whether or not
the Police Department of this city is in
a position to spare a sufficient number
of men to effectively accomplish this
result I am not prepared to say. be
lieving the matter Is one which rests
entirely within the judgment of the
Chief of Police. There are other viola
tions of the law continually pccurrlng
in this, city which require the constant
attention of the department. There are
large and populous districts that are
almost entirely without police protec
tion, and I certainly question the pro
priety or advisability of stripping many
of the beats In this city and increasing
the danger of other crimes, probably
of more stfrhfaa . import to the whole
community than the gambling In Chi
natown, t
"I find that the Police 'Department is
seriously hampered in all of its efforts
to suppress the practice of gambling in
Chinatown by the difficulties encoun
tered in entering the places" where fan
tan is played and in securing legal evi
dence sufficient to obtain a conviction.
"While, the investigation held by this
commission dealt, â with the administra
tion of the Pplice Department in China
town solely,* I_ desire {o say. In conclu
sion, that, v inasmuch as a great .deal
has been said tending to .implicate
many officials and others in the corrup
tion believed to exist, no . . evidence
of any 'kind or nature-, whatsoever
has been introduced before this ; com
mission tending in any manner to di
rectly implicate any officials of this
city and county, or of the Police De
partment, or any citizen of this city
in any participation in the corruption
fund." "\ > ' . . - ...
NO COLLUSION SHOWN.
The report signed by Commissioners
Howell and Hutton exonerating Com
misioners Drinkhouse and Reagan is as
follows:
"Wfe find that no evidence was pro
duced before us tending in any .way to
show that .either Police Commissioner
John A. Dririkhouse or Police Commis
sioner .Thomas Reagan ever received
any part of the Chinatown gambling
corruption fund, nor were they at any
time In collusion with any of said gam
bling-houses or those who directly or
indirectly operated the affairs of the
same. The above Commissioners, be
ing interested, do not sign this finding."
The i reports of the Commissioners
were shown to Chief of Police Wittman
last evening. He said he could only say
that Commissioner Howell's report re
garding the "number of men It would
take to effectively suppress gambling
in Chinatown agreed with his views.
"I have long sought 200 additional
policemen." said" the Chief, "but have
been unable to. eet them. Many dis
tricts are now, pleading for more pro
tection, but I am unable to give it to
them. I have always held that the
safety of the taxpayers of this v cityâ
of its. white citizensâ is of more im

PLATT STARTS
DEPEW'S FIGHT
Calls a Meeting to Urge the
Be-election of the Junior
Senator From New York
NEW YORK. Dec. 19. âSenator
Thomas C. Platt has called a confer
ence of Republicans to meet in . the
Fifth-avenue Hotel on Wednesday
morning at 11 o'clock to takii' Trie'asures
for the re-election of Senator Depew.
More than fifty invitations have been
issued to leaders and legislators. ,,..,,
Platt says that this confer
ence is called largely for the purpose
of neutralizing the effect of the recent
conference at which Governor Odell and
many other prominent Republicans
were present and which showed itself
strongly in favor of Frank 8. Black's
candidacy.
When asked to-night whether he had
invited Governor Odell to consult with
him. Senator Platt replied: "Of course
I have not done so. The Governor is
backing the other man."
Senator Platt said that he had vis
ited Wall street to-day and consulted
with a very large number of prominent
Republicans, all of whom, he said, ha
had found to be enthusiastically in
favor of the re-election of Senator De
pew. Regarding the conference, Sena
tor Platt said it will be attended by-
Republicans who are Interested in the
election of a United States Senator
men from different parts of the State.
"I shall not turn anybody away," he
added. "I want to find out where we
stand and I purpose getting to the bot
tom of the matter?
"Governor Odell was mistaken,** Sen
ator Platt said, "if he believed that
Black would have a majority in the
Legislature." .^â â â â ;'X - <
Ex-Governor Black came to the city
from Troy to-night. When asked if the

BERLIN. Dec. 19.â Berlin has pro- ]
<:jÂ«.-ed in Madame Wilhelmlna Hartert
i. woman financier whose operations,
while not on so vast a scale, are as dar
ing and spectacular as those of Mrs.
Cassie Chadwick of Cleveland, Ohio.
The woman's methods have been
brought to public notice in a sensation
al trial, in which, although she was
acquitted on a technicality, the meth
ods by which she amassed a fortune
by victimizing members of the highest
society of the city have been revealed.
The expose came as the ..result of the
suicide af Baron Nettelbladt, a young
nobleman, who found himself entangled
in her net and preferred death to the
course she insisted that he pursue. This
v as that the Bason "should^ marry an
lisiress indicated by Madame Hartert
and settle his debts out of his wife's
dowry. At her trial it was proved that
Madame Hartert, who kept .up a su
perb establishment in Berlin, had made
half a million dollars by getting young
aristocrats into her clutches and then
nrrangjng marriages for them and tak
ing a "rake-off."
HER LOWLY ORIGIN'.
Considering her low birth, lack of
education and refinement, the rapidity
v.jth which Madame Hartert forced her
v.xy into Berlin society and secured an i
influential social position is amazing. She !
is the daughter of a street scavenger,
v. ho plied his occupation in the German
capital for thirty years, while her
mother began her career as maid of all
work in a common lodging-house and
<-rded it as a laundress. Madame Hart
ert gained her education partly in the
public state schools, where attendance
1? compulsory up to the age of 14 years,
and partly in the vice-laden streets of
Berlin. Following hpr mother's foot
steps, she began as a domestic servant,
but drifted Into other employment.
The future Madame Hartert gradu
ally became familiar with the manners
and customs of men and v.omen about
town. At th* age of 25 years she mar*
r!ed a waiter named Hartert and ac
rompanif-tl him to London and Paris,
whither the ups and downs of his trade
led him. In this way the scavenger's
daughter pained a practical knowledge
Of languages and a wider acquaintance
with the manners and customs of other
countries. Hartert, the waiter, was a
drunken vagabond and went through a
long period of unemployment In Lon
don, at the conclusion of which he blew
his brains out in a fit of depression.
Left alone, penniless and with formid
able debts to pay, Madame Hartert fled
to Berlin, where 6he nought employ
ment of various kind?, without success.
AUDACITY HER PORTE.
Disappointed in her efforts, she con
ceived the Idea of exploiting the weak
nesses of high society, with which she
had become acquainted before and after
licr marriage. By pure audacity she
succeeded in taking a large house in a
fashionable street in the most,'Aristo
cratic quarter In Berlin, though she
had not a single cent In her pocket to
pay the rent. She contrived to persuade
the owner of the house that she was a
wealthy woman In momentary financial
difficulty, and having secured the house
was equally successful In inducing
tradesmen to furnish it and fit It up
in a sumptuously luxurious manner on
credit-
Having progressed thus far, it was
comparatively easy to obtain dresses
and the best of everything on the
same system. Finally, by pledging the
contents of her house, which, of
course, were not hers to pledge, Mad
ame Hartert borrowed J5000 from a
professional money lender to use as
working capital In her projected oc
cupation. Her next move was to se
cure admittance Into good circles of
society. She rented a pew at a fash
ionable church and was unfailing in
her attendance on Sunday roomings
and evenings. She subscribed to char
ities and took an active part In.ba
zaars arranged for benevolent pur
poses. Soon people began to take an
Interest In the widow, whose dress was
Immaculate and who seemed to have
command of - unlimited .'supplies of
money. ... ; .
Madame Hartert was playing ; [ a \

dangerous game. The $5000 which
she had borrowed was largely ex
hausted at a very early state of her
career. She paid $500 toward her
house rent, $1<H)O to her dressmakers
and $1500 on aVcount to her furnish
ers, leaving only $2000 to launch her
self into society.
Her efforts were successful in that
direction, however, and in a remark
ably short period of time Madame
Hartert's house became the resort of
numerous men and women belonging
to the upper classes of society. There
were plenty of penniless young men
of noble birth who offered themselves
as candidates for the hand of the sup
posedly wealthy widow. It was
among this class of visitors that Mad
ame Hartert secured her # victims. Pos
ing as a good friend, who was in
clined to help them out of their fin
ancial embarrassments, Madame
Hartert offered to procure loans for
them from professional money lend
ers, offering herself to be their se
curity.
PREYING OX POVERTY.
A typical case of this kind was ex
posed in the course of the recent trial.
One of Madame Hartert's visitors was
Baron Maltzahn. a lieutenant in the
German army, who soon confided to
her that he -was threatened by ruin
because he could not pay debts
amounting to $15,000.. Madame Hart
ert said to Baron Maltzahn:
"I cannot lend you this amount my
self, but ray credit will enable me to
borrow it from a money lender for
you. Your credit is so. bad that you
canrrot possibly borrow' the money
yourself. I will give the money lend
er a promissory not'e and you can
give one to me for the same amount.
I feel quite safe in doing you this fa
vor, because I know that you as an
officer will certainly _â¢ pay , your, debts
to a lady."
Madame Hartert then borrowed
$15,0tib from a money lender, giving
him a promissory note for $17,500 in
return. Two days later she Informed
Baron Maltzahrr that she- had', been
able to get. the \ required sum of $15,
000, but that she had been compelled
to give the money lender a', promis
sory note for $25,000 payable In three
months. Baron Maltzahn, who was a
careless young fellow, -accordingly
gave Madame Hartert . a promissory
note for $25,000 and the two became
better friends than ever. As the time
approached for the repayment of the
sum to Madame Hartert Baron Malt
zahn, whose expectations in other di
rections were disappointing, began to
grow extremely uneasy and Madame
Hartert carefully , fostered his distress
by telling him that she could not pos
sibly repay the money lender and that
all her furniture would be seized un-

less he fulfilled his obligations at the
appointed time.
One day when Baron Maltzahn was
confessing the impossibility of finding
the money Madame Hartert remarked
to him: , .
. "Your only chance is marriage with
a wealthy woman. If you are willing
to extricate yourself from all your dif
ficulties and to save me from ruin in
this way I will arrange through some
matrimonial agency to have you intro
duced to houses where there are heir
esses eligible for marriage."
Baron Maltzahn accepted the pro
posal and Madame Hartert persuaded
another friend of hers, named Count
Koenigsdorf, to introduce him to' the
house of a wealthy Jew named Rosen
feld. Madame Hartert told Baron
Maltzahn and persuaded him to believe
that the matrimonial agent, who ac
tually did not exist, had compelled "her
to give him a written promise to pay
him $25,000 on the day on which
Earon Maltzahn married the heiress,
Miss Rosenfeld. Baron Maltzahn ac
cordingly gave Madame Hartert a
writUn promise to pay her $25,000 for
the imaginary matrimonial agent on
the day on which he married Miss
Rosenfeld.
In due course Baron Maltzahn pro-

Rosenfeld and the wedding took place
after a brief engagement. Miss Rosen
feld received a dowry of $300,000, half
of which, according to the terms of
the marriage contract, was immediate

dame Hartert for the phantom matri
monial agent and another $25,000 for

Hartert was only obligad to pay $17,

secured a clear profit of $32,500 on
this acute double transaction.
In the course of a decade Madame
Hartert amassed a fortune of $500,000

deals!' 'Her methods \vere , finally ex

a long letter, explaining that he pre

Hartert's house suddenly became de

the matter up and brought an action
against her on various charges of fraud
and usury. The prosecution broke
down on technical legal points and
Madame Hartert was acquitted. Her

BULLET WOUND
IN GIRL'S HEAD
Identity of Young Woman
Murdered on Mountain in
. Colorado Still a .Mystery
CORONER HOLDS INQUEST
Detectives Hope to Be Able
to Grain Clew From the
Dental Work in Her Mouth
COLORADO SPRINGS, Dec. 19.â
That the y<5ung woman who was found
dead on Cutler Mountain on Saturday
was murdered was proved by the post
mortem examination to-day. The re
moval of her matted hair and scalp
revealed a wound in the head and re
sulted in the discovery of the bullet.
There is as yet absolutely no clew
to the identity of the "girl, the author
ities here being wholly at a loss to
establish anything in this connection.
Many inquiries have been received
from large cities in the East in regard
to the girl, but nothing beyond that
revealedLyesterdax, has been discovered,
the corpse showing nothing in the na
ture of birth marks nor scars.
The bullet entered the left side of
the head and penetrated the skull about
two inches, behind and one and a half
inches above the ear. The bullet,
which was of 38 caliber, lay between
the skull and the scalp, the latter not
being perforated. The bullet was much
flattened by its two contacts with the
skull. â  â¢ â *. â 
The authorities place no faith in the
possibility that there is anything in
the nature of a clew in any of the
cards and papers found about the
scene of the crime. Thousands of tour
ists annually attach their cards, letter
heads and other papers bearing their
names to trees and rocks in the can
yons and on the mountain tops in the
vicinity of this city and these are
blown about the hillsides promiscu
ously. The dental work in the mouth
of the murdered girl will afford sure
identification if Its description is seen
by the dentist who did the work. The
work was worth at least $150.
Dr. Hanf ord, who performed the post
mortem examination, stated that the
girl's condition at the time of her death
was normal and that it was simply a
case of wanting to get rid of some
body.
At the Coroner's inquest held to-day
several witnesses were examined, in
cluding the men who found the body,
the Sheriff and a dentist, who made
an examination of the teeth of the dead
girl. The jury returned the following
verdict:
"The unknown woman came to her
death on a date unknown to this jury
and the cause of the death was a gun
shot wound, below the back of the. left
ear, ranging upward, the bullet being
n. 38-callber and fired by some person
to the jury unknown-"

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 19.â The holiday
edition of the High School Bell, the
publication of the student body, will
not be circulated unless It Is reprinted
is the edict issued by Principal R. D.
Hunt and the faculty of the school.
This is all because of two "joshes" the
editorial staff of the Bell allowed In
the columns. â¢ The sixty-page edition
was all printed and bound and ready
to be sent when the order came from
the faculty. Alexander Franklin, the
editor, and Earl Menker, the business
manager, were summoned by Principal
Hunt and informed that the Bell as
printed could not be circulated and If
it was they would be expelled. Here
Is one of the Jokes:
Yes. Grace M , your fancy stockings aw
certainly very attractive.
The young lady belongs to the bas
ketball team of the school and the
"josh" grows out of a game that the
team recently played.
The other one objected to is as fol
lows:
First youngr lady â Did you ever notice
Thereon Sherburne's gold teeth?
Second young lady â No; he hasn't any.
First young lady â Yes. he has.
Second young lady â I have never noticed It.
First young lady â Perhaps you were never
as close to his mouth as I have been.
Principal" Hunt declares that the
staff of the Bell has always been
obliged to submit the proofs of the
matter used in the publication to a
faculty committee to censor, but this
time did not do so. As soon as he saw
a copy of the Bell he sent for the editor
and business manager and told them
that the two "joshes" were vulgar and
must not be used. The boys explained
that In the rush It was impossible to
submit everything to the faculty and
get the paper- out on time.
The editor and manager hav^ re
signed their offices. At a meeting of
the class on Friday the seniors ac
cepted the resignations and decided to
stand by their associates. The action
of the principal Is denounced as arbi
trary and a number of cartoons show
ing . him in the role of the oppressor
with his foot on the editor of the Bell
are being circulated among the stu
dents.
It is believed that the parents of
scholars in the senior class will try to
settle the matter. The high school
strike in this city six years ago played
havoc with the standing of the school
and drove away many students from
abroad who went to school here.
. Late this afternoon it was reported
that the high school faculty had taken
the edition of the Bell from the Eaton
job office, where tjiey were printed. It
Is said they will blot out the objec
tionable "Joshes" and then mail the
edition.

This great piano sale on "TVebers,"

but a few days, as nearly all are gons;
and the great difference between the
retail price of such a piano, and the
factory cost figures we shall make to-
day, and to-morrow (to close out tha
few beauties we yet have of this cele-
! brated make) are so widely different,
j that It would be almost impossible to
: believe It. unless you are Interested
I enough in a piano- to step In immediate-
I ly while they can be had, and see for
I yourself.
I Any buyer of a Weber, Wheelock, or
! Stuyvesant piano at this sale, can use
I it for five years, and then get more
j money for it, if he by some misfortune
! had to sell, than he would now have to
j pay us for it, and we'll make it $10 or
j $15 a month.
You can hardly afford to let this op-
portunity pass, and then have to pay as
j much money for some cheap piano as
i we would charge you to-day for a
! "Weber," or pay $208 more money for
! a piano of the same higrh grade when
this sale is over, and Webers are gone.
Some of our finest and most costly
j pianos are yet left, but the best is the
[ cheapest, and at our prices to close out
the "Weber line," anybody can afford
to buy the best who can> stand $10 to
$15 a month â and that's easy.

THE INSTALLATION
OCCIDENTAL LODGE BANQUETS
High Tribute Paid to
Masons fry John
rtcNauafit.
The annual banquet of Occidental
Lodge No. 22, Free and Accepted Ma
sons, took place at the Hotel Bucking
ham last night at 10 o'clock. The in

big bunches of crimson holly berries.
Worshipful Master 'Byron G. Mantle,

of the evening in his opening remarks.
He said the banquet was only intend
ed for the promotion of good fellow-,
ship and for a sort of heart to heart
talk. He added further that no such
thing, as aristocracy existed in Ma
sonry. Every Mason was upon the
same footing, whether he be the poor
man or the millionaire.
. John McNaught was the speaker of
the evening. As he arose he was hailed
with enthusiastic cheering. He chose
for his subject, "What I Don't Know
About Masonry." â  The speaker evi
dently did, however, know a great deal
about Masonry. His remarks, while
humorous, were most pertinent to Â»the
occasion.
Masonry, he said, represented broth
erly love and fidelity. A grand element
cf faith was one of the great charac
teristics of this magnificent order. It
was known throughout the wide world.
So long as Masonry* existed Justice
would never be without a champion,
charity would never be without a gen
erous hand and the cause of human
brotherhood would never lack a friend.
These remarks brought out tremen
dous applause and every man in the
big company rose to hia feet, cheering
the speaker and his eloquent remarks.
Speeches were also made by E. C.
Landis, the retiring master, and James
A. Snook, the past master. There were
songa by Professor Wanrell and L. A.

DISTINGUISHED
JURIST IS HERE
Sir Charles H. Tupper of
1 Canada Making His First
Visit to San Francisco
FOK MES. DUXSMUIR
Kepresents Widow in Fierce
Contest Over the Will of
Her Late Son, Alexander
Sir Charles Hllbert Tupper, former
Minister of Justice and Attorney-Gen
eral of Canada, who is regarded as one
of the brightest legal lights in the Ca
nadian Dominion, arrived In this city
yesterday from Victoria and i3 regis
tered at the Palace Hotel. This is his
first visit to San Francisco and is made
in the interest of Mrs. Jean, Dunsmuir,
widow of the former Premier of Brit
ish Columbia, who has joined with
Mrs. Edna Wallace Hopper in contest
ing the will of the late Alexander Duns
muir with a view of depriving James
Dunsmuir, a brother of the deceased,
of letters of administration on the lat
tfcr's estate.
The question as to whether the willl
of Alexander Dunsmuir, executed in
this city, was properly made under the
laws of California, was raised in the
Supreme Court of British Columbia
recently, while the case was on appeal,
and an order directing the British
Consul of this city to take testimony
on this point was made. The main j
point at issue is that the witnesses to j
the will did not know the contents of
the document when they signed It,
notwithstanding the fact that the Cali
fornia law specifically provides that
the witnesses must be advised by the j
testator that the document is his last j
will. In the hearing of the contest at j
Victoria the witnesses testified that j
they did not know the nature of the j
document- It now remains to be seen ,
whether they will appear before the â¢
British Consul and change this testi
mony.
Sir Charles said yesterday that he
expects to meet the British Consul and
Judge Coyne of New York, who repre
sent Mrs. Hopper, to-day and arrange
for the taking of depositions at the
consulate. The hearing will begin this
week. . *
The presence in San Francisco of the
distinguished jurist from the north* is
expected to be marked with several
dinners in his honor, given by members
of the local bar, who have followed
their British colleague In his rapid
rise to prominence in the Dominion of
Canada. Sir Charles, although a
young man, has been prominently be
fore the people of Canada for a num
ber of years. His public life 'began
in Nova Scotia, of which he is a native
and which he represented in the Cans
d?an House of Commons for several
years. Later his services as Minister of
Justice and Attorney-General earned
for him knighthood. In 1902 he re
tired from politics and announced his
intention of never again taking a
prdminent part in them. He has since
moved to the Pacific Coast and i3
practicing law at Victoria.

denied that she was dismayed because

to Europe, after having been told by,

TRAGEDY IN THE CAB. j
Early In her story Miss Patterson !
told of her original meeting with j
Young, of their life together and of
their contemplated European trip. She 1
told of her talk with Young the night !
before . his proposed departure for :
Southampton; of her being awakened
by a telephonic message from him to j
go to the uler to see him off; of the \
ride down town; of the moments in a j
salon, and of the ride in the cab before j
the shooting. She was asked to de- j
scribe what occurred after leaving the
saloon while driving down West Broad- !
way. !
"We talked about his going away, j
and he kept questioning me about my j
coming to meet him," she said. "I
did not saj' anything and finally he i
said: 'But I don't feel positive .that j
you are going to come over. I believe
that you are fooling. Are you?' Then
he said, 'Are you going?' I said,
'Well, Caesar, there's no use saying 1
will, because I've made up my mind j
not to, but you go ( over there and get j
things quieted down until the folks
have forgotten about things.. I will
meet you at the Saratoga meeting.'
"He looked at me awhile and said/Do
you mean that?' and then he grabbed
me by the hand nearest to him and
pulled me over toward him. He hurt
me so that I tried to pull away, but I
could not get away from him. I put
my other, hand up and he grabbed me.
Somehow or other I got away from
him. I told him that he hurt me.
"He said, 'If you don't come- over
there, and I have to wait until the
Saratoga meeting. I may nearer see you
again. My horses have gone back oh,
me. I've lost all that. money. Now I'm

MRS. CHADWICK
NOT IN COURT
: Â» i
Effort, However, Will Be
3[ade.to Have Her Appear
at the Proceedings To-Day
FOUR WITNESSES HEAED
Lawyers Attempt to Learn
Something of Her Jewelry
and Her Missing* Trunk
CLEVELAND, Dec. 19.â Four wit
nesses were heard to-day in the bank
ruptcy proceedings against Mrs. Cassle
Chadwick, after â¢ffhlch the hearing was
continued until .to-morrow, when Re
ceiver Nathan Loeser hopes to have
the woman present.
Mrs. Chadwlck's appearance will de
rend on a report to Referee in Bank
ruptcy Remington as to her physical
condition, her counsel stating in court
that she was ill and it being agreed
that several physicians should make an
examination to-morrow morning.
But little Information was secured
to-day as to Mrs. Chadwlck's jewelry
or of a missing trunk and valise the
receiver desires to find. The examina
tion to-day of two of the witnesses,
Emil Hoover, Mrs. Chadwick's son, and
Freda Swanstrom, her maid, centered
about these articles. From several ad
missions made Receiver Looser, how
ever, will continue his inquiry with the
hope of locating the property.
At the afternoon session of the court
Benjamin G. Malzimer, manager of a
Cleveland fur company, told of furs
and rugs valued at $2000 which were
held for Mrs. Chadwick. The proprie
tor of the same concern denied, in an
swer to a question, that Mrs. Chadwick
had purchased a $1600 fur-lined coat.
Young fell over on my lap, got half
way up, fell again and I thought he
was having a spasm. He kept twitch
ing and twitching. I called to him
and tried to make him answer, but he
â¢would not. I believe I put my hand
up and told the cabman to drive to
the druggist. I don't know whether
I did or not. That was my idea and it
seemedâ oh! ages before I could get
any one to pay any attention to me
and help me. A policeman got into
the cab and I felt so relieved. I knew
he would take care of Mr. Young. I
seemed to be dazed in my memory
after that."
" 'Xan,' look at me; did you shoot
Caesar Young?" asked Levy
"Mr. Levy, I did not have any pistol
to shoot Mr. Young with and If I
hadâ" and the voice of the witness
broke.
Assistant District Attorney Rand ob
jected to further answer and was sus
tained.
"Did you or did you not shoot Caesar
Young, Nan?"
"I did not. I would give my own
life to bring him back if it were in
my power," she answered.
FIRST MET IN CALIFORNIA.
Describing her relations with Young
the prisoner said that she first met him
in California in 1902, while on her way I
from San Francisco to Los Angeles, j
She frequently visited the racetrack j
with him. In March of this year she
came back East and lived with her sis
ter, Mrs. Smith. After that she went j
to her parents* home in Washington j
and later went back to Los Angeles I
when Young telegraphed for her to!
meet him there. Again she left for the j
EaEt when Young went back to San j
Francisco. She and Young arranged j
to meet at Chicago and did so. When
they were separated they corresponded, J
: exchanging letters and telegrams al- j
most daily. Then she came to New
York on May 2 and the next day Young :
: called* on her at her hotel: They had J
no .quarrel.
She said the first proposition made to
{ her that she should leave Young was
' made by Young's brother-in-law, Mc
j Kean, who said- that Mrs. Young want
| ed Miss Patterson to go away- The
< conversation with McKean took place
! in a restaurant. Young was present
| and they talked over the subject for
j three-quarters of an hour.
AT THE RACES WITH YOUNG.
J Later in the same evening the three
! went to Harlem. There It was decided
I that Miss Patterson should go to Eu- j
' rope, and McKean promised to get the j
i steamship ticket for her. After that
I she remained several days at, a hotel I
! and Young called on her until he went
; down to Sheepshead Bay to live. Then
she did not see him for nine days. On
! June 3 Young called her by telephone ,
i and asked her to go torthe races. She i
! went with her brother-in-law, J. Mor
j gan Smith, reaching the Gravesend
i track at 2 o'clock. There they met
j Young, and she put some bets on the j
; first race with money Young gave her. j
j Smith was acting as commissioner for
I Young that afternoon. j
j Miss Patterson said she remained j
! at the track until after the sixth race, i
! She placed a bet on Cricket in" the final j
race, at Young's suggestion, and won.
Smith cashed the bet for her. 'They
returned to the city by train.
This testimony was important, be
cause it was alleged by the prosecution
! that it was about the hour at which
j the sixth race was won that' the re
volver with â  which Young was shot
was sold by Pawnbroker Stern. The
prosecution sought to show that the re
volver was purchased by J. Morgan
Smith. .
ALLEGED ' EYEWITNESS.
The first alleged eyewitness of the
cab tragedy called by the defense was
Milton W: Hazelton, an Inventor, of
Oneonta, tf. Y. Hazelton said he was
visiting in New York early in June and
was on West Broadway on the morning
of June 4. He was walking slowly
along when he saw a hansom cab ap
proaching. There were two persons in
1 the cab, one a woman, whom he identi
fied as the defendant, and the other
'a man. As the cab neared him he saw
the flash of a revolver.
"Did the man" have - the revolver in
his hand at the time of the report. and
the flash?" asked Levy.
! "He did," replied the witness. "He
had both his hands raised above his
left shoulder. As the shot rang out
the man's head fell into the woman's
lap -- and v she placed her hands on top
i of his head."
j Hazelton said there was a man with
him who also saw , the shootinc. It

The cry for economy and retrench

COUPLERS MUST
BE AUTOMATIC
Decision of Supreme Court
Favors the Employes of
Railways of the Country
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19. â In a de
cision handed down by Chief Justice
Fuller in 'the case of Johnson vs. the
Southern Pacific Railway Company,
the Supreme Court of the United
States to-day practically held that all
cars, including locomotives, should be
equipped with uniform automatic
couplers. The court also held that
dining cars cannot be exempt from
the requirements of the safety appli
ance law when in use, even though
empty.
The decision is considered by the
Interstate Commerce Commission and
the Department of Justice to be a de
cided step forward in the protection
of railroad employes. Secretary Moss
ley of the commission summarizes the
points decided as follows:
First â That couplers on railroad cars must
be *)f such a character that they will couple
automatically and fn save employes from
going between cars, though absolute unifor
mity Is not required.
Second â A car. though empty and on a side
track, may be engaged in Interstate commerce.
Third â Th^t for the purpose of the safety
appliance law locomotives are cars and that
they are required to be equipped with auto
matic couplers.
â¢ The accident out of which the suit
grew occurred at Promontory, Utah,
in 1900, when Johnson, who was the
head brakeman on a through passen
ger train between San Francisco and
Ogden, was directed to couple the lo
comotive to a dining car which was
standing on a sidetrack at that point.
The engine and car were equipped re
spectively with the Jenney coupler
and the Miller hook, but they did not
work together and Johnson was com
pelled to go between the cars, with
the result that his hand was so badly
mashed' that amputation became nec
essary. He brought suit for damages,
but both the Circuit Court for the
District of Utah and the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Cir
cuit decided against him. To-day's
opinion reverses both these judg
ments and orders a new trial.
BOUNDARY NOT AFFECTED.

WASHINGTON, Dec. IS. â The Su
preme Court of the United States to
day decided the boundary case be
tween the States of Missouri and Ne
braska in favor of the State of Ne
braska. The case involved the ques
tion as to whether a change, in the
course of the Missouri River, which
has the effect* of changing land from
the west side of the river, tÂ«. the, east
of the river, takes jurisdiction, from
Nebraska and invests it with Mis

SCHOLARSHIP
IS CRITICIZED
Stanford Professor Ques
tions the Value of Rhodes'
Gift to American Students
Special Disratch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 19.
Professor Samuel S. Seward, a mem
ber of the English department of*
Stanford University, in an open letter
to the Daily Palo Alto to-day, ques
tions the value of the Rhodes scholar
ship to the American student. As
Professor Seward has been a student
at Oxford himself much weight is at
tached to his criticism and the fact
that there is to be a Stanford appoint
ment to the scholarship in January
makes his letter at this time one of
vital interest.
Professor Seward questions the
value of three years" study in an Eng
lish university under the conditions
Imposed by Cecil Rhodes. The work
in this time i3 elective only to a very
limited extent, and the student b ra
quired to take over work that he hua
done thoroughly in America.
"When he gets through." asks Pro
fessor Seward, "is he better able, hav
ing spent the three most vigorous
years of hia life studying according to
the methods of a different people, to
cope with the problems of life in
America ?"

BLOODSTAINED RIG
AROUSES SUSPICIONS
Man Who Hires It Gives False Name
Detectives Searching for a Mysterious Stranger Who Is
Supposed to Be Murderer of Policeman 'Brown.
OAKLAND. Dec 19.â Chief of Police
tiodgkins has taken up the trail of a
mysterious stranger, a blood-stained
buggy and the conflicting stories of two
Berkeley boys that frame into a pos
sible clew to the murder of Policeman
Georjre W. Brown.
The buggy waa rented yesterday
morning at 9 o'clock from H. M.
Waterbury. proprietor of the Berkeley
livery' stable, at _ 2061 Center '"-street,
Berkeley. The man who rented the
vehicle answered the general descrip
tion of the footpad who has been oper
ating in Oakland, supposed to be
Brown's Elayer. This man wore dark
clothes and a black soft hat, was
smooth shaven and of medium height
and build. He was nervous and mani
fested a desire to get away as quickly
as possible. More than that, subse
quent revelations proved that he had
*iven a false name and had deceived
JVaierbury as to his errand.
Nine hours later the buggy, with the
body, wheels and frame covered with
blood, was driven into the stable by
two boys, who told such conflicting
tales about the finding of the vehicle
that the police Of both cities are mak
ing every effort to trace the man who
% ot the rig Sunday morning.
This stranger gave Waterbury the
name of Dr. Cole, saying he had offices
In the postoffice block, Berkeley. There
Is no Dr. Cole at that address. The
pseudo physician urged Waterbury to
hurry with the rig â that he was on an
emergency case. The stranger drove
away at a rapid gait.
SUSPICIONS GROW.
Shortly after "Dr. Cole" departed
Waterbury's suspicions were aroused.
He had read about the shooting of
Brown, and the thought struck him that
all -was not right with his customer.
Waterbury recalled the striking simi
larity in the appearance of his cus
tomer and the general description given
Â«if the Oakland footpad. The livery
man decided he should have held the
stranger instead of allowing him to go
with the team.
Later developments only aroused
Waterbury to keener suspicions. His
buggy was taken to the stable at 6
o'clock by Louis Flschel, son of a
MAD ACT STILL
IN LITIGATION
Attorneys Will Try Again to
Fix Blame of Melrose Ex

Still in the belief that there is merit
in their claim for damages against the
Western Fuse and Explosive Com
pany, on account of the Injury done
by the explosion of the Melrose mag
azine in IS 98. the trial of a third suit
against the company was begun this
morning by Attorneys Reed & Nus
bauxner. M. C Chapman and Stanley
Moore, notwithstanding that twice the
Supreme Court has declared the com
pany not responsible for the act of the
Chinese, Ah Ung Chung, who, in order
to . escape arrest, blew himself and
seven deputy sheriffs into eternity.
In the present case the complaint
has been so amended as to charge
the company with negligence in erect-
Ing a magazine in a residential portion
of the city without earthen bulkheads
about It to direct an explosion sky
ward. Instead of allowing it to scat
ter. Notice was given that testimony
would be Introduced to show .that no
damage, except a possible shattering
of glass, would have resulted to the
houses in the vicinity, had earthworks
twenty feet high been built about the
magazine. There are forty-six claim
ants awaiting the outcome of this trial
with claims aggregating $75,000

tc&tt Si. Bowne, Peari St, New York-
Berkeley butcher, and a companion
named Neid.. One boy first told about
finding the buggy on the San Leandro
road. They changed their story after
some questioning and asserted that
Xeid had found the rig near Butcher
town, the horse having been running
away. There was no one in the ve
hicle when Xeid picked it up. He met
Fischel and the boys, by dint of ques
tioning, learned that the team belonged
to Waterbury, to", whom they return
ed-it. â¢'Â»
Waterbury noticed that the team was
bespattered with (blood. He notified
Chief of Police Hodgkins of his suspi
cions and City Marshal Kerns of Berke
ley. The evidence, whatever it might
lead to, was not obliterated.
TRACE THE TEAM.
In tracing the whereabouts of the
team the police learned that it had
been seen standing yesterday afternoon
in front of J. Camelong's saloon, San
Pablo avenue and Sixty-sixth street.
Camelong remembered that three men
had driven up to his place in a buggy
that answered the description of Wat
erbury's and had taken a drink. Soon
afterward the team disappeared and
the men left. He could not say wheth
er either of his customers answered the
description of the alleged "Dr. Cole."
The police are not satisfied with the
story told by the boys. They are mak
ing investigations on a theory that
either Xeid or Fischel was given the
buggy by the man who hired it at some
place that they have not divulged.
Effort is being directed to the arrest
of every known footpad who might
have been operating In Oakland.
"Babe," otherwise Anthony, Curtin
was arrested in San Francisco on sus
picion. Detective Holland went to San
Francisco' to-day to make investigation
as to Curtin's movements. It is thought
he^ was in Oakland Saturday night.
WILL, VIEW SUSPECT.
The pclice will send Hersey and
others that were held up last week in
Oakland to see Curtin to-morrow in
San Francisco to ascertain whether he
can be identified as the footpad.
Detectives and policemen have gone
over the ground of the shooting, tra
versed the neighborhood, run down
scores of rumors, interviewed many

sible phase of the case that might have
suggested any motive for the killing
other, than that pf a' criminal firing to
escape arrest. Not a witness to the
shooting has been found who can say
more than that the flashes were seen.
Not a semblance of verity has been
given to the theory of revenge. Every
aspect centers around the original
theory that Brown had seen a man
acting suspiciously; had dismounted
from his horse to Investigate and was
shot while approaching the suspected
person.'- "V ,i â¢:â  * .. "f
, Expert .tests were made to-day at
police headquarters with the bullet
that was found by Detectives Quigley
and Kyte at a spot on Broadway op
posite the place where Brown was shot.
The purpose of the tests and examina
tion was to get an idea if possible as to
the kind of weapon from which the
missile was fired.
Coroner Mehrmann will hold an In
quest Wednesday ' evening at 7 o'clock
in the case of Brown.
Brown was born In San Francisco
and was 35 years old. He was a mem
ber of the Native Sons of thÂ» Golden
West and : of the Oakland Carmen's
Benevolent Association. Under the po
lice pension law, his wife"" will receive
a monthly pension of thirty-three and
one-third dollars during life unless she
should marry again.
"Babe" Curtin still denies that he
was in Oakland on Saturday night, and
could not therefore have shot and killed
Patrolman George \V. Brown. He says
that Detective Taylor could not have
seen him on a. ferry-boat going to Oak
land about 5 o'clock on Saturday after
noon, as he was at home at the time.
Curtin's mother called upon Captain
Burnett yesterday morning and made
a statement that "Babe" was at home
on Saturday evening from about 5
o'clock till 9 o'clock. He was out once
or twice to the butcher's and grocer's
between these hours, but not for more
than a few minutes at a time. Detec
tive Taylor saw the butcher, and he
said that Curtin was at his place on
Saturday night about 8 o'clock. The
grocer \ was not sure whether It was
Saturday night or some other night
that Curtin called at his store for a
Jugful of steam beer. He never paid
much attention to Curtin.

Mrs. R. Ghristopherson, the . victim
of the beating by her husband and son,

became enraged at^ome remark made
by her and that both set upon her,
beating her with a horsewhip until she
sank exhausted under the punishment.

ABANDONS OLD
ELECTIVE PLAN
Municipal League Compelled
to Go on Primary Ticket
Like All Other Parties
NEW MANAGEES CHOSEN
Wholesale Approval Is Given
to the Acts of the Pres
ent City Administration
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
- 1016 Broadway, Dec. 19.
The Municipal League, which has
been a distinct political party In. all
city elections for more than a dozen
years, prepared to-night for the cam
paign of next spring. It was decided
to go on the primary ticket In the way
required by law. This is a distinct
change from the methods of the league.
Up to the present time the league has
never held a primary, but has always
selected Its delegates through what is
known as a board of managers. This
board announced the delegates to the
convention of the league and a oon
vention was then held and a ticket an
nounced to the people. This was done
in order to prevent any of the older
parties from competing with the mem
bers of the league and taking posses
sion of the league's convention by
throwing primary tickets into the field
at the last moment and wresting con
trol from the leaguers. This year the
primary law will compel the league to
announce Its ticket and hold its pri
mary In the regular way and under the
compulsion of the new law this will be
done. The board of managers will an
nounce its list of delegates and will
ask the leaguers to go to the polls and
vote.
President Carey Howard of the
league made a report upon what has
bten accomplished and the league ex
pressed Its approval of the work done.
A motion was carried that' the hearty
indorsement of the league be extended
to the present municipal administration
and particularly to those members who
were elected by the league.
A board of managers was elected as
follows: C. A. Chichester, C. H. Daly,
H. N. Dalton, J. D-Frencn, J. E. Far
num, J. D. Galloway, G. W. Hunt, Irv
ing C. Lewis, Fred Kahn, W. G. Man

STRENUOUS RUNS
FOR WATERBURY
Man With Bride, but No
House Furniture, Begins
Search for His Effects
BERKELEY HONEYMOON
Daughters of Newly Mar
ried Man Play Hide and
Seek With Their Parent
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Dec. 19.
George A. Waterbury. finding him
self in the plight of a man who has
a bride but no place to keep her, and
with no furniture with which to set
up a home, to-day applied to Justice
Edgar for a search warrant, with
which he hoped to find hla daughters
and recover household goods to be
used in preparing a home for his new
wife. The furniture in question had
been used by Waterbury and his
daughters at their home on Prince
street, but was moved from the house
by the daughters, with* the neighbors'
help, a few days ago, after Waterbury
informed the girls that he intended to
bring a new wife to take charge of
thf) household.
The Waterbury girls resented'the
proposal, and barred their father from
the house. He went to San Francisco
vowing vengeance, and returned to
swear out a warrant for the arrest of
Percy Betts and S. J. Hankins, friends
of the young women, who have assisted
them to retain possesion of the house,
and whom Waterbury charged .with
battery.
Waterbury married Mrs. Mary
Crump, according to his programme,
last week, but when he came back to
Berkeley with her it was to find his
furniture all gone, and his daughters
in hiding. The house whfch Mrs. Wa
terbury No. 2 was to- rule over was dis
mantled. The prospect was dreary-
Mr. Waterbury raged, and declared
to-day when Justice Edgar refused to
issue a search warrant for the stuff
that he would bring a .civil suit in
Oakland to-morrow to recover the fur
niture..
Waterbury procured subpenaa to
day for his daughters, Charlotte and
May, who are cited to appear in Jus
tice Edgajr's court to-morrow morning
end testify in his battery case against
Percy Betts. .

MAY SAFELY VENTURE
TO ANY ALTITUDE
The difficulties of respiration at high
altitudes have attended many moun
tain, climbers and explorers and the
theory advanced in explanation has
been that this trouble was caused by
the reduced tension of the oxygen In
the atmosohere.
Professor Mosso, an Italian scientist,
has recently disproved this theory by
showing that if the pressure of the
mixture of oxygen and nitrogen mak
ing up ordinary air be reduced to one
third of an atmosphere, and then the
proportion of oxygen be increased so
that its partial pressure Is thÂ© same
as normal, the mixture Is breathed
with inconvenience, accompanied by an
abnormal. respiration and pulse.
By taking supplies of pure oxygen
and mixtures of gases to the summit
of Monte Rosa and analyzing the blood
it was shown, however, that a diminu
tion In the amount of carbon dioxide
in the air, due to the low pressure,
was doubtless responsible for much of
the trouble in respiration. Proof of
this was afforded by breathing a mix
ture of 80 per cent of oxygen and 20
per cent of carbon dioxide on top of
Monte Rosa, with a feeling of pleas
ure and ease, while the effect of the
same mixture near the sea level in
Turin was to produce 1 " giddiness and
vomiting.
If this discovery is substantiated by
further experiments it seems that by
the' carrying of cylinders containing
this mixture of gases the highest
mountain peaks can be scaled, while
the mere provision of oxygen is of
doubtful utility.â Chicago Chronlcla.
Russian Customs Fines.
United States Consul General Watts
at St. Petersburg calls attention to thÂ«

Supervisors Order Condem
nation Proceedings for
Large Area on Twin Peaks
TO OPEN TWO STREETS
Deed Accepted to Property
for Extension of Shrader
and Cole From Parnassus
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution directing the City
Attorney to begin condemnation of
forty-seven acres of land on Twin
Peaks for a reservoir site for the pro
posed high pressure water supply sys
tem for better fire protection. The res
olution recites that the Golden Gate
Park Land Company has offered to sell
the site to the city for J2000 an acre,
and it is advisable that a judicial deter
mination be had of the value of the
land under the law of eminent domain.
Chief of Police Wittman explained to
the Finance Committee that two bills
for harness had been Incurred without
requisition being first filed for the same
previous to the committee's order that
requisitions must be filed before the
purchase of any goods. "Wittman agreed
to comply with the order.
Chief Engineer Sullivan Informed the
committee that he had never recom
mended the erection of a chemical en
gine-house on Twentieth street, near
Connecticut, as asserted in a communi
cation from the Fire Commission. Sul
livan said that the existing companies
could protect the territory in the
Potrero as soon as the Santa Fe road's
bridge on Eighteenth street was com
pleted. This would be in about sixty
days. The committee decided to defer
action until ocular demonstration was
made that the engines were equal to
the task of easily reaching the dis
tricts to be protected.
Action on the bill of A. Carlisle for
$400 for printing the "Guide to Voters"
for the Department of Elections was
deferred one week, the Finance Com
mittee expressing the opinion that the
charge is exorbitant and the printing
of the pamphlet was unnecessary.
City Treasurer McDougald filed with
the committee a letter agreeing to
waive the statute of limitations in the
matter of his claim for 56000 in fees on
collateral Inheritance taxes collected by
him. The Superior Court has decided
against the claim of ex-Treasurer
Brooks for similar fees, and the City
Attorney was requested to ascertain if
Brooks intends to appeal the case. Mc-
Dougald was asked by the committee
to consult with his attorney as to the
advisability of accepting the Superior
Court decision, especially in view of the
fact that the Supreme Court has de
cided in the case of a San Diego Treas
urer that he is not entitled to the fees.
The committee postponed action for
three weeks on the resolution to memo
rialize the Legislature to pass a law
permitting banks to act as depositories
for moneys collected by the city for

An ordinance was passed to print ac
cepting a deed from Emily F. Pope to

THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, TUESDAY. DECEMBER 20, 1901.
WILL HASTEN
STREET REPAIR
Alleged Threat of Member
of Yorke Company Blocks
Payment of September Bill
TO PAVE PHELAN BLOCK
Finance Committee Hits on a
Plan to Improve Bad Con
dition of Thoroughfare
The Finance Committee of the
Board .of Supervisors held a confer
ence late yesterday afternoon with the
Board of _ Public Works for the pur
pose of taking steps to hasten the
work of repairing bituminous pave
ments. The Supervisors at their meet
ing had deferred action on the final
passage of the ordinance authorizing
the payment of the September de
mands of the F. M. Yorke Company
for street repairs.
An erroneous report had been cir
culated that the company had filed a
notice with the Board of Works that
it would refuse to continue the work
of repairs because an inspector was
not measuring the surface covered
with bitumen according to its lik
ing. Commissioner Schmitz said no
such notice had been filed, and the
Commissioners of Works had no
knowledge that the repairs, had
been stopped. The September bill was
passed to print under an agreement
that the Yofke Company would re
sume the repairs. The threat that the
work would be stopped was unoffi
cially made by a member of the con
tracting company.
Commissioners Schmitz and Mae
stretti urged that an understanding
be had as to the computations and al
lowances for depth in resurfacing
pavements.
"If Inspector Boone has allowed the
company more than he should, he is
not doing his duty and should be dis
charged/' said Maestretti.
"We wan ( t to have the streets put in
good condition, for they are in a
deplorable state," said Schmitz, "and
we think something*dennite should be
done."
It was agreed to have another con
ference, at which F. M. Yorke and
Boone will take part and some defin
ite arrangement be made to hasten
the reoairs.
TO REPAIR PAVEMENT.
The committee also agreed to hold
a conference with Auditor Baehr for
the purpose of using some $2000 out
of the;$40,000 appropriation for street
repairs to put the pavement in front
of the Phelan building in good condi-
tion.
"It seems to me," said Schmitz,
"that Mr. Phelan, at whose instance
the pavement was put down as an ex
periment, and who is receiving reve
nue from the rental of a restaurant
under the sidewalk, in space properly
belonging to the city, should pay for
the â¢ repairs."
| It was explained that the block had
been accepted by the city, and the
contractor had kept it in repair for
five Â«Syears. It was decided that, in
case the demands on the repair fund
exceeded the appropriation, the $2000
would be taken out of the urgent ne
cessity fund.
'. The petition of the Excelsior Home
stead Association for the establish
ment of a flrehouse at Ocean and San
Jose avenues was referred to the Fin
ance Committee to be taken up when
the next budget is being framed. Chief
Sullivan strongly recommended the
project and the committee agreed
with him.
The petition of B. T. McBain for
the return of $32,907 71 paid as col
lateral inheritance tax on. the estate
of Henry Pierce, deceased, on the
ground that it was illegally collected
was denied. Similar petitions of Phil
ip I. Fisher for the return of $40,
135 43 and of Charles R. Aljkn for
$3189 13 in the estates of Levi Strauss
and Edgar Allen were also denied.
A demand for $6270 was ordered
drawn in favor of Victor Albauze and
others, who obtained judgments
against the city in suits for condem
nation of lands for St. Mary's square.
WrLIi NOT CLOSE STREET.
The petition that Beach street,
westerly from Laguna, be closed was
denied In view of the City Attorney's
opinion that the charter makes pro
vision for the closing of streets less
than forty feet in width only, and
Beach street is sixty-eight feet wide.
The roadways of Pierce street, be
tween Vallejo and Green; Laguna
street, between Washington and Jack
son; Clayton street, between Freder
ick, Carl and Parnassus avenue; Scott
street, between Fulton and McAllister;
Central avenue, between Golden Gate
avenue and Turk street and between
Grove and Fulton, were fully ac
cepted.
School Director Boyle agreed to
urge the Board of Education to pay
one bill of $570 for portable school
houses to M. Anderson, who com
plained .that his bills aggregating
$1354 were overdue. The Finance
Committee promised to pay. the other
bills after further inquiry.,
The board defeated a resolution re
pealing a permit granted to C. C. Gro
ther to maintain a boiler for a .laun
dry at the corner of York and Twen
ty-sixth streets. Protests against the
permit were filed by more than 100
property owners and residents in the
vicinity, some of whom appeared in
person and addressed the board..Dan
iel A. Leary said the waste matter and
water from the laundry would' flow
into the unhealthful swamp at the
end of York street, making the nui
sance much worse. . Grother admitted
that he was forced to leave his old
place at Twenty-fifth and Bryant
streets because of the nuisance caused
by smoke from his laundry.
Thetboard adjourned to meet next
Tuesday, as Monday Is a holiday.
SUFFERS INDIGNITIES.â For alleged Itt
dirnitles suffered on a broad gauge boat and
on the train between Oakland pier and. West
Oakland, C. II. Ross yesterday sued the South
ern Pacific Company for ?400<> damages. He
alleges that' on November 28 he was a pas
eenger on the ferry. As the boat neared the
mole he was twice struck from behind with
missiles. ; He made a complaint to the servants
on the boat, he says, and they knecked hln.
down and handcuffed him, in which condition
he was carried to West Oakland and given his
release
OIL DRIPPINGS
UNDER THE BAN
Ordinance Is Passed Requir
ing Devices -to Be Put on
. Automobiles to Stop Leaks
MUST KEEP CARS CLEAN
Measure Compelling Them to
Be .Washed and Fumigated
Adopted by Supervisors
The ordinance requiring suitable
devices to be attached to automobiles
for the purpose of preventing oil drip
pings being deposited on the public
streets was passed to print by the
Board of Supervisors yesterday. Su
pervisor Lunstedt contended that the
noise made by automobiles while
standing still in the public streets,
owing to the machinery being allowed
to run, was a greater nuisance than
dripping oil and suggested that an
other ordinance prohibiting the noise
bo passed. He promised to submit
such a measure.
It was resolved* that- the city and
county disclaim all interest in the land
in 50 vara block No. 115, which is now
in litigation in the courts.
Street and sewer work was ordered
on Parnassus avenue between Clayton
and Cole; Sixteenth avenue from H to
I streets and Twenty-first avenue be
tween Lake and California streets.
An ordinance was passed to print*
requiring street cars to be washed at
least once a week and to be disin
fected whenever the Board of Health
notifies the companies to that effect.
The ordinance requiring gongs to
be rung on street cars when crossing
streets was amended so that the gongs
need only be sounded when the car
starts to cross, in order to prevent con
tinuous ringing.
The ordinance prohibiting the
conveyance of bread, cakes or pastry
through the public streets in open bas
kets or exposed containers was passed
to print.
Th*e amended ordinance prohibiting
the* keeping of swine within the boun
daries of the city and county, except
that part known as Butchertown, was
referred to the Health Committee.
Grades were ordered changed on
Vicksburg and Jersey streets.
The following ordinances were final
ly passed:
Granting permission to O. McHugh to lay a
temporary track on H street, between Four
teenth and Sixteenth avenues, for grading pur
poses only.
Prohibiting persons from driving over hose
belonging to the Fire Department.
Ftfctns grades on points on Carmelite, Pierce
and Portola streets.
Accepting the roadways of blocks on Cle
ment I I-von and Church str*ftÂ».
Amending the ordinance retiring the con
sent of property owners to permits for livery
stables so that any existing building used as a
stable may be rebuilt on Us present site with
out such consent.
Charles Welch objected to the pas
sage of the last bill saying it would
enable the Saiy Francisco Laundry to
move its stable next^to residence, flats
belonging to him on Eddy street. A
reprepresentative of the laundry said it
was intended to erect a modern, brick
structure on the site and the vote on
the ordinance was unanimous.
The Hayes Valley Club obtained a
permit to hold an amateur boxing ex
hibition on January 13.
SUPREME COURT WILL
NOT RELEASE LETCHER
State's Highest Tribunal Says Prisoner
Has Recourse to Proceedings
Before Federal Judges.
The Supreme Court has refused as
sistance to George E. Letcher of San
Jose, the slot machine man, who is
making a fight against being extra
dited to Ohio, where he is under in
dictment for defrauding insurance
companies. The court, in response to
the prisoner's petition "for a writ of
habeas corpus, says:
Indictment charge3 a public offense within
the statute of the State of Ohio. The regulari
ty nf the proceedings had before the Governor
of the State of Ohio, culminating in his requi
sition fcr extradition, are rot reviewable by
us in this proceeding. Upon the proposition as
to whether or not the petitioner Is a fugitive
from Justice within the meaning of the consti
tution of the United States, that question
seems to be absolutely decided against peti
tioner's contention by the Supreme Court of the
United States in Roberts vs. Reilly, 116 U. S.,
80 and the decision of that court upon this
constitutional question is absolutely binding
upon th'B tribunal. Whether or not the facts
in the case of petitioner are such as to call for
a modification of the views expressed in Rob
erts vs. Reilly is a question which can only be
decided by the Federal courts, whose writs
and processes are open to petitioner.
Superior Judge Cook remanded
Letcher on another writ yesterday. T.
W. G. Lyons of 11B Henry street, a
friend of the prisoner's wife, asked for
a warrant yesterday for the arrest of
Garret Fox, an officer from Ohio, who
is here to take Letcher back for trial.

CONVICTED OF MURDER
IN THE SECOND DEGREE
Jury at the Second Trial of Harry
RadcllfTe Renders Verdict Which
Looks Like Compromise.
The jury in the case of Harry Rad
cllffe, charged with the murder of An
drew Riley, a hofi carrier, âat Ninth
and Sheridan streets, on the morning
of June 26, after being out for about
three hours yesterday afternoon
brought in a verdict of murder in the
second degree. It was reported that
the jury on the first ballot stood ten
for murder in the first degree and two
for acquittal. The verdict was appar
ently a compromise. At the previous
trial the jury stood nine for acquittal
and three for conviction.
When the case opened yesterday
morning District Attorney Byington
made the closing argument. He de
livered one of the most powerful and
scathing arraignments against the de
fendant ever heard in the court. He
urged the 'theory that Radcllffe held
up Riley, intending to rob him, and
during the struggle deliberately shot
Riley. He believed thai the story
told by the young wife that Riley
made an insulting proposal to her was
invented for the purpose of shielding
her husband.
There was no scene In court when
the verdict was -rendered, although
the defendant's wife*, mother and some
other women relatives were present.
The defendant will be sentenced on
December 31.
NEW ALASKAN RAILWAY
WILL BE CONSTRUCTED
Chicago Capitalists Are Preparing to
Build Line Up the Copper
River.
Among the latest arrivals at the Pal
ace Hotel is John T. Evans, a well
known young attorney of Chicago. He
is on his way to Seattle to attend. an
annual meeting of the Hubbard-Elliott
Copper Company, which controls large
interests in Alaska and is backed main
ly by Chicago capitalists. The com
pany owns forty-two copper claims on
Elliott Creek, ninety miles northeast of
Valdez. Three railroads from Valdez to
the Hubbard-Elliott claims. by way of
the Copper River have been proposed,
but ud to the present time none of the
promised enterprises has taken shape.
Attorney Evans, who is treasurer of
the Hubbard'Elliott Company, said
yesterday that the franchises for two
of these roads would expire this year,
and it is the intention of his company,
assisted by the Havemeyers, who own
valuable properties near the company's
claims, -to construct the railroad imme
diately in the event of the promoters
of the other lines failing to get to work
before the end of this year. One of his
purposes in attending the meeting In
Seattle is to lay "before the directors
the plans for the new road.

SEQUOIA CLUB
TO ENTERTAIN
CELEBRITIES
To-night at the St. Francis the Se
quoia Club will entertain in its own
informal and therefore delightful
fashion two distinguished visitors to
San Francisco, Miss Hallie Ermlnie
Rives and Howard Malcolm Tichnor.
These Tuesday evening at homes of
the club have become charming in
stitutions, following somewhat the
lines of the Twentieth Century Club
of New York, thus putting to rout tho
suspicion that men of the West are
not social creatures; likewise that
men and women are not mutually
clubable.
Thus are these Tuesday nights good
fun. But whether the club will prove
as strong an attraction for the men
to-night as the little affair out at
Woodward's remains to be seen. The
club or the fight? That will be the
question. , The women members of the
club are marveling at the poor judg
ment of the gladiators in choosing
Tuesday night for their little affair.
The cards announce the reception at
8, the unusually early hour being
necessitated by a business meeting to
follow. At this meeting the. future
policy of the club will be discussed.
With both a reception and a busi
ness meeting on the cards the fore
gathering of the club promises to be
unusually interesting. And all male
members not present will be accredit
ed with being at the fight.
Tennis Club Directors 3Ieet-
The regular monthly meeting of the
directors of the California Tennis Club
held last night was the most satisfac
tory one held in many months. A
new set of by-laws, drawn up by the
committee, met with- the approval of
the directors. Several changes were
made, but they were slight. They will
be voted, upon by the club members
during the next two weeks and it is
safe to say will be approved by them.
The rule productive of the most dis
cussion was that in regard to the ploy
ing of school boys on Saturday after
noon. They will not be allowe-1 to
occupy the. courts after 3 o'clock to
the exclusion of the other members.
Much credit is due the by-laws com
mittee, composed of Dr. H. P. Hill,
Lloyd Baldwin and G. H. Busch.
Many improvements on the clubhouse
and grounds were recommended an!
will be made at once by the grounds
committee. The directors present
were W. S. MacGavin, F. S. Mitchell,
Dr. W. R. Lovegrove, Dr. H. P. Hill,
C. G. Kuehn and Grant Smith. Ab
sent, Dr. Noble.

POSTOFFICE CLERKS
FORM AS ASSOCIATION
Will Co-operate With National Asso
ciation and Work for Betterment
of Existing Conditions.
Sunday afternoon representathres
from the following postomces met in
San Francisco and formed a State as
sociation of postoffice clerks: San
Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Sac
ramento, Pasadena, Santa Cruz, San
ta Barbara, Berkeley, Stockton, Ba
kersfleld and Riverside.
The object of the association is to
co-operate with the National Associa
tion of Postoffice Clerks through the
Postmaster General in obtaining need
ed legislation for the betterment ol
the service. The United National As
sociation of Postoffice Clerks now ha*
pending before Congress two bills rec
ommended favorably by the PostofUeo
Department, namely the classification
bin and the eight-hour bill. As it i3
now, the postofflce clerks have to
work as many hours a day as the
work necessitates, In some offices as
high as twelve and fourteen hours a
day, and their Increase In salary is
dependent entirely upon the appropri
ation made by Congress. The post
office clerks, through the recommen
dation of the department, are at
tempting to remedy this by having a
classification bill passed, allowing
each clerk an Increase of $100 a year
until he obtains $1200 a year, and
also to have the department run on an
eight-hour basis.
The meeting was a very successful
one. The executive committee was
empowered to call a State convention
at some future date.
The visiting delegates were the
guests of the San Francisco branch at
dinner. â¢ â¢
The following officers were elected:
President, James E. Power, San Fran
cisco; first vice president, F. J. Meyer,
Los Angeles; second vice president.

rVBLICATION OITICE THTRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN -FRANCISCO
TUESDAY DECEMBER 20.' 1904
A NEW DEPARTURE.
IT is apparent thai there is a new tone and purpose in politics in
thi* country. The much derided civil service laws have begun
to affect public opinion and the old idea of the victors taking the
spoils lias less strength. The utterances and acts of President Roosc
veit have given impetus to the new idea. The victorious party at an
election begins to understand that its duty is to give a proper 'ad
ministration, rather than to seize every official position in sight for
the benefit <Â»f the "workers/" Roosevelt has in this matter been the
lep.st partisan of our Presidents, and his practice, as set forth in his
letter to Representative Gardner of Massachusetts, has set the pace
for others.
Under the old system, which seems happily to be passing away,
the most helpless classes have been the greatest sufferers. No other
country makes as ample provision as ours for the defective and indi
gent class, and in none is more attention given to the reform of the
falicr. and rescue of the unfortunate. This habit has given rise to
an immense number of public institutions, most of them under State
law. and many in municipal control. These institutions for the in
sane, the mute, the blind, the aged and the indigent, the incorrigible
and the criminal require a large officiary and many salaried posi
tions, if ihe interests of their inmates are taken into account, they
require, also, the service of specialists in a great many professional
lines.
There has gone up in the past a sustained complaint by organi
zations, interested in charities and correction, in penology and in
k-nacy. that there is a lack of such specialists as are needed in these
institutions,; the reason being that every change in political admin
istration means a change, in institutional staffs. Specialists not being
assured of permanency going hand in hand with efficiency of service
have been disinclined to take service in places that had no security of
tenure, and where service, no matter how skillful and useful, was
no protection against removal for no other reason than that the
place was wanted for some partisan favorite, as a reward for personal
service rendered to a politician who had the power to pay for it out of
the public pocket by giving a place in the public service. The in
stances are legion in which the appointees so rewarded had no train
ing, fitness nor adaptability for the places they drew .as prizes in
the political lottery. In this system have originated the painful scan
dals which are the odium of administration in this country. We
have had them in California and they have offended the moral sense
of the people in nearly every State in the Union.
If these changes occurred only when the partisan administration
changed, they would not be as frequent or as bad. But they habit
tially occur when the same party remains in power, and chooses new
men in the State administration, with friends who have aided their
political ambition and hunger for pay. Parties ultimately feel the
bad effect of this, for it is the fruitful cause of internal feuds and
factions that disturb legitimate partisanship and impair the useful
ness of a party organization.
Worse than all this, however, is the injury to the intended bene
ficiaries of public benevolence. Taxpayers found institutions through
their representatives to supply the needs of humanity. Not to do so
would subject civilization and Christianity to reproach. But the
benevolent purpose is constantly nullified by treating the patronage
of such institutions as part of the spoils of personal or party victory.
In no part of the field of public activity has reform been as
needed, and nowhere is its appearance more welcome, nor more
promising of results gratifying to the humane instincts of the people.
One of the States that has suffered most acutely from the spoils sys
tem applied to State institutions is Indiana. Time and again the in
stitutions of that State have been brought to high efficiency by faith
ful administration, only to lose it, decline and become the instru
ments of distress rather than relief to their inmates, by vicious, par
tisan use of their patronage. All over the country the people who
have right ideas on this subject will take heart and hope, upon seeing
the light of better things appear in Indiana. A new Governor takes
office there. The State institutions were preparing for their usual
shakeup, and around them stood rings of politicians ready to break
in when they got the word from the new Governor. They have got
the word, but it is not what they expected.
Governor Hanly has published a statement in the Indianapolis
News, an independent paper which supported him, which deserves
to rank with the highest influences for reform. The Governor says :
"Xo person holding a position in any of the State institutions whose
services have been and are efficient and satisfactory will be removed
during my administration. I sought to make my position clear con
cerning this matter before the election, and the policy then outlined
â will not be departed from. I have little patience with the sugges
tion that faithful and efficient officials in the penal, correctional, char
itable or educational institutions of the State shall be removed to
make places for others. This will not be done in any case, however
great my personal obligations may be to the applicant, nor how
ever dear he may be to me."
That declaration should be printed in illuminated letters and
hung on the walls of every executive office in the country. It should
come, finally, to be demanded by every convention nominating a can
didate for Governpr, that he appear before it and take a pledge to
carry out that policy. Then, indeed, our politics would enter upon a
Golden Age.
The News, commenting, says: "Mr. Hanly is entitled to all the
more credit for his attitude in view of the fact that no man in any
of the offices is under the protection of a civil service law. The Gov
ernor'could make a clean sweep if he wanted to. But he has the
sense and the character to understand that the business of the
State cannot be carried on along such lines. He realizes that he was
elected not the Governor of the Republican party, but of the State
of Indiana, that he is the servant of all the taxpayers, that it is tfieir
money and interests he must safeguard and that they have a right
to insist upon efficient service. Further than this Mr. Hanly makes
it clear that he does not believe that the offices which belong to the
people ought to be used to pay personal or political debts, or to dis
charge the obligations of friendship. We have not in many a day
seen a more clear and honest statement of the great principle of
civil service reform." <â ; -
Now let us hear from the other Governors-elect. Will they fol
low the old plan or the new? If they choose the old they will feel the
hand of a rebuking public opinion, for we have entered a new and
needed epoch.
A STUDY IN IMPOSTURE.
WITHOUT any -desire or intention to unduly comment upon
a case which is sub judice, the revelations made as to" the
financial operations of Mrs. Chadwick suggest an inquiry'
into the causes whicji conduce to such criminal successes causes
which seem to lie somewhat beyond the normal experiences of the
law. Madame Humbert was, perhaps, typical of the order of ad
venturesses of which America may possibly furnish the latest illus
tration.
These artistic and astute individuals seek. their prey not among
the ordinarily credulous and inexperienced, but among the classes
that should be peculiarly fortified both by instinct and by education
against fraud. They spread their nets, not for the weak-minded nor
for those unversed in the financial duplicities of the day, but rather
for those whose position is supposed to be a guarantee of the hard
headed common sense essential to business life. And they do not
spread those nets in vain. They seem to find no, difficulty in per-'
suading the greats financier to advance colossal sums upon the se
curity of an empty safe, or in coaxing the banker to accept a signa
ture that his own clerk would scornfully reject.
By what strange and .-'subtle means do they rob their victims
of their prudence and reduce them to the commercial ineptitude of
the village school girl? They are not usually endoVvcd by nature

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL," TUESDAY, DECEMBER 20/ â  1004.
MISS WARING'S
ESCORT
BY OTHO B SENG A.
SIX shabbily-dressed men lounged
in front of the fashionable
hotel. Five, evidently com
rades, conferred together in
low tones, then one ap
proached the, sixth man, say
ing guardedly: "Are you one of us?"
The man smiled half satirically.
"naw; I'm de real ting, see?"
His questioner turned away in dis
gust.
The man laughed softly, the low,
enjoyable laugh of one who appre
ciates. . .
A tall young woman, whose attire
â¢evidenced wealth and refinement, en
tered the hotel vestibule.
One of the five groaned softly.
"Who is she, Dyke?" eagerly ques
tioned another.
"Miss Kate Waring of Denver.
"Worth half a million -and eccentric.
Visiting Cousin Dorothy. And me in
this beastly tramp's rig!"
He plucked viciously at the ravel
ings on the cuff of the shabby coat
and gave an irritated kick at the curb
ing with his run-down, unpolished
shoes.
. Miss Waring's stately entrance into
the great dining-room was arrested
by the head waiter.
"This way, madam," courteously;
"I will conduct you to the ladies' din
ing-room."
Miss Waring glanced about her.
"It is not necessary," calmly, "I will
remain here."
, "Pardon me, madam, but ladies
without escorts are served in the room
at the right. I will conduct madam â "
Miss Waring's calm glance surveyed
ths small, crowded room at the right
and then returned to the great cool,
room in which she stood, with palms
and ferns in profusions. She noted
the many vacant tables and the num
ber of ladies present.
"I do not wish to go in there. I
prefer to have dinner served here,"
making the statement tranquilly, with
the air of one accustomed to have def
erence accorded her slightest wish.
"The rule Is imperative, madam,"
â with courteous firmness, "ladies with
out escort â "
"Reserve that table by the window
with the ferns beside It, the third on
the left," and the graceful figure turn
ed to the outer door.
There was no hesitancy in Miss
â Waring's voice or manner as she ad
dressed the group of shabby men.
"Will one of you gentlemen do me
a favor?" clearly and unsmilingly.
Six shabby head-coverings were off
In an instant, and six more or less
manly forms bent low before her.
"Thank you all," gravely, "I want
one of you to act as my. escort and
my guest, so that I may be accorded
the privilege" â the scarlet lips curled
a trifle â " of having my dinner where
I have chosen to have it I will ask
you, please," turning abruptly to the
one who had designated himself as
"de real ting."
"Oh, but â " began one of the un
chosen eagerly.
Miss Waring's face and gesture for
bade further \vords.
"I thank you all for your courtesy.
If this gentleman accepts â "
"It is a privilege, madam," bowing
gravely.
" 'De real ting,' is he?" cried Dyke
vengefully, when they were out of
hearing! "Did you observe his speech
and that bow? He's one of the fel
lows set to watch us!"
"Xonesense, Dyke, there isn't a man
in the class as old as he. He's seen
actual tramping, I'll stake a thousand
on It. Why didn't you tell Miss War-
Ing who you are?"
"Aren't we under oath not to dis
close our identity?" demanded Dyke
hotly. "Besides, look at me!"
"1 ordered a table reserved," said
Miss Waring to "de real ting."
, "I see it â third on the left."
He led the way with easy grace, a
light of amusement gleaming In his
dark eyes at the evident consternation
of the waiter who hesitated slightly
before seating the serene young lady
and her strange escort.
Miss Waring ordered the dinner with
precision and discrimination.
"I hope," she remarked pleasantly,
when the waiter had gone, "I hope
you approve my order."
Â» There was not the slightest embar
rassment in her manner or condescen
sion in her speech â the man was her
guest.
"The order Is perfect, madam, and,
permit me to eay, admirably given."
Miss Waring smiled.
"Are all of Boston's" â she paused
for an instant In search of a word
that might not embarrass her guest â
"submerged, such Chesterfields as the
six to whom I spoke?"
"The others are Harvard students."
"Harvard students!" in momentary
bewilderment. "Oh, I know; they are
doJnsr penance."
"That is the meaning, madam,
though not the term they use."
"Are vou?" lightly yet with an anx
ious tone In the low tvolce.
"I am a genuine hobo."
She passed her card case to him.
"You should know who is your
hostess," graciously, "and I will ask
the name of my guest."
He took out two carfls, writing on
the back of one and returning it to
her with the case.
She glanced at the writing:
JOHN LESTER, HOBO.
NO ADDRESS.
BORN IN BOSTON.
"Thank you, Mr. Lester. I hope you
with a superfluity of those physical charms to which men in all
ages have notoriously succumbed, nor does it seem that they fasci
nate their 'victims by any brilliant conversational or social powers.
They simply tell their transparently impossible story, formulate
their impudent demands, and reap the golden harvest which is in
stantly spread at their feet. By what means they do it must be left
to the student of human nature who is accustomed to wander into
the domain erf tie wonderful, and to explore the darker recesses of
the human mind. ,' But are there any more of these strange and
wonderful women? If so, where are they, and what are they doing?
There has existed, and still exists to some extent, a false sentiment that
labor is .degrading or belittling. The contrary is true. An ideal condition of
society can come only when every member of it recognizes that he is bound
to exercise whatever skill or .strength or Acuity he possesses to its full capa
city, not selfishly or for the sake of gain merely, but for his own happiness
and development and for the, benefit of all. And there should be no restric
tion on any one, either legal or social or through association, In regard to his
labor or Its fruits. If by patient application or natural endowment a man
possesses more skill than his fellow or if he chooses to be more industrious
he is entitled to the" full benefit of it.â Cincinnati Enquirer.

"I am, Miss Waring. I can > do full
justice to the dinner you have ordered.
You might remind me ifâ if I forget
anything. It's â¢ a long time since I
have dined with ladies."
The tone was" serious, but there was
a dancing light in the fine eyes that
Miss Waring caught, and she smiled
sympathetically.
There was but little conversation.
"It's a Privilege, Madam."
Miss Warring was graciously courte
ous as became a hostess, but even a
dull man in Lester's place would* not
have presumed upon the situation. â¢ '
"I thank you for your escort, Mr.
Lester," said the girl, dismlsslngly, as
they passed out.
"I am your debtor. Miss Waring,"
earnestly, "if I were not a hobo I
would ask when and where I might
pay my dinner call."
â¢ A sudden impulse prompted her re
ply.
"To-morrow evening; my present
address is on the card you have."
In all her twenty-flve years Kate
Waring had never before been so cu
rious or so anticipative. She smiled
approval ,at the card he sent up â
a slir> of paper with "John Lester"
boldly written.
She was stm smiling when she en
tered the drawing room, but the smile
vanished as she noted the fashion
able clothes he wore.
He was quick to see the change.
"You are sorry I came? It was
taking an advantage â " 4
"Pardon me, I am somewhat dis
appointed. It waa a pleasure to find
something genuine^-I do not like im
itations, not even an imitation hobo."
"It is now that I am the imitation.
Miss Waring; the clothes are hired
for the occasion." â¢ â â â 
She held out her hand cordially.
"Consider yourself welcomed, Mr.
Lester, and allow me to say that the
clothes are very becoming."
He flushed boyishly.
"It's five years since I've worn a
rig like this. I hardly knew how to
put it on."
Miss Waring led the conversation
to toDics of interest to a man of edu
cation and refinementâ books, music,
the drama, finding! her companion
conversant with the best.
"Will you tell me something of
yourself?" she asked presently, "why
you are a/â a wanderer, and how you
liveâ even a traveler must eat, I sup
pose."
He hesitated but an Instant.
"I have tramDed for five years. I
work awhile in a place till the devil
drives me on againâ the devil of . my
conscience. I suppose It will yet
drive me back to" â his face grew
grave and his voice harsh, but he kept
stoically on â "to Denver, where I am
wanted for the murder of Manuel
Laredo, a Mexican, who I killed on
Starbrlght ranch."
She rose excitedly.
"I bought Starbrlght ranch last
year. Manuel Laredo is among the
workmen there!"
He sprang to his feet, his face
aglow, his, eyes filled with sudden Joy.
"He did not die, and I am not â "
Then his face paled again.
"I forgot,'' hoarsely, "there may be
a dozen Manuel Laredo's; those Mexi
can names â "
"It is the same man," she Inter
rupted positively. "I have heard the
story, and seen the scar of the bul
let on his cheek."
She talked on, waiting â¢ for him to
regain control of himself.
"We should be friends, Mr. Lester.
Royal Thornton is my stepbrother.
I have often heard him speak of the
trip abroad that you two | made to
gether vears ago. I know now why
your name seemed so familiar. Will
you go back to Colorado?"
He took her outstretched hand in
both his own. %
"As your escort, Miss Waring?"
She smiled assent, flushing beauti
fully.

Half of Lovers' anfl Married
Folks' Woes Caused by
Intimate Friends.
By D # orothy penimore
5O sweetheart, fiancee and wife
one bit of advice have I to offer
that sounds as cynical as. I be
lieve it to be sensible â keep your
"intimate friend" outside the
paling of your happiness.
For fully one-half of the foolishness
In a love affair, is the intimate friend
responsible. For more than one-half of
the misery which comes from a broken
engagement the intimate friend is to
blame. And In many a divorce it was
the intimate friend, man or woman,
who â wittingly or unwittingly â played
the serpent in the little private para
dise of domestic happiness.
To an unmarried woman in love, or
to a wife, an intimate friend is the
dearest and most dangerous enemy,
both of herself and of her lover or hus
band. She is a conspicuous Invitation
written out on one's horizon to talk
over things that are more sacred In
the heart than on the lips. Rarely is
she wise enough, even if she is gener
ous enough, to tip the balance of confi
dence on the right side of the scale.
A lady said to me the other day:
"I never 'run in' at a neighbor's
house to spend an afternoon. I know
that I shall want to run in again the
next morning to take back all I said
the day before. The unwise things you
say and don't take back get such a
deadly grip on you. Your Indiscretions
of speech are almost certain to become
sooner or later Indiscretions of conduct
I defy Satan to try any tricks on my
Idle hands. I have them In subjection.
But I must admit that he has my busy
tongue at his mercy."
She is right about it; the confidential
mood is the highroad to mischief. When
in your personal affairs you have com
mitted yourself to any course by an
ill-considered opinion you have deliber
ately tied a handkerchief over your
eyes: you can't help falling over the
things that get in your way.
Consistency, however trivial it may
appear to the philosophic mind, is the
skeleton in the closet of the ordinary
mortal. What we have said and done
is the implacable god in. the car which
rides down our sincerity. The past as
we have lived It out in word and deed
Is the heathen idol before which one's
unregenerate soul bows down in slavish
worship.
The intimate friend deserves to be
blackballed from Cupid's club for an
other offense. â¢
By her receptivity and sympathy
she breaks down one's self-reliance.
One learns to depend upon her judg
ment, to see with her eyes, to think
with her mind. She is likely to run
one's courtship, and more than likely
to run It into the ground.
Oh, lovers all, be self-reliant In your
love. By any other course you cheapen
yourself, and also the one to whom
you give your devotion.
Our unexpressed thoughts live as
flowers do, without any further pur
pose than just being flowers.' And as
we sit quietly in the sweet solitude of
our little gardens there are melodious
voices all about us which lift our souls'
and bear them upward on winged fan
cies fair. {'â  :â - \, â¢'â 
We are too hospitable when -we
open the garden gate and let outsiders
in.
For these same reasons married life
has no room in it for intimate'friend
ships. Married happiness must be a
walled-In Eden.
It is no wonder that many. a hus
band regards with jealous dislike his
wife's intimate friend. He knows that
there are confided to this woman, who
Is a stranger to himself, many inci
dents which are sure to appear to her,
and to the people to whom she in her
turn relates them in a careless mo
ment, as weather-cocks on the top of
his domestic edifice.
The world does love a lover; but It
loves him as a robin loves an apple,
for the savor which it means to apply
to its own palate. ,
If lowers are wise, therefore, they
play a two-fold role upon the stage of
human experience. Between them
selves they study out what love is in
Its rurlty and in its stroÂ«,* simplicity.
And the secrets of their spiritual re
search they keep inviolate os a con
sequence of nature. But before thÂ°
eye? of the wide public let th*m play
another drama, the preity passing
show of love's fair affectations. s

THE SMART SET
BY SALLY SHARP.
Miss Gertrude Dutton and Joslah
Howell will be married In Trinity
Church on January 11. The ceremony,
taking place at 8:30 o'clock, will be fol
lowed by a reception at the home of
the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liam J. Dutton, on Pacific avenue. At
tending the bride will be Miss Mollie
Dutton, maid of honor; Miss Edna
Middleton, Miss Maylita Pease. Miss
Pearl Landers and Miss Belle Harmes,
bridesmaids. The groom will be at
tended by Thomas Barbour, with Ed
ward Greenway. Harry Dutton, En
rique Grau and Lindsay Scrutton as
ushers.
A luncheon was given yesterday to
Miss Marie Voorhies by Mrs. A. S.
Baldwin. Miss Voorhies will be mar
ried on December 31, at 4 o'clock, to
Captain H. P. Young, who is on his
way to San Francisco now and will ar
rive this week. The wedding will be a
large one, several hundred invitations
having been issued. Receiving the
guests will be Mrs. H. E. Huntington,
Mrs. Emory Winshlp, Mrs. Malcolm
Henry, Mrs. Inez Shorb White, Mrs.
Reginald Knight Smith, Mrs. Frank
Sullivan, Mrs. William F. Herrin, Miss
Phelan and Mrs. Alexander Oarceau.
Mrs. Joseph Anderson Chanslor and
Mrs. Frederick Wilson Klmball enter
tain to-day at an elaborate tea In the
handsome home of Mrs. Chanslor,
Washington and Jones streets. This Is
one of the occasions when the hostesses
have been obligedâ and their courage is
commendable â to ask for replies to
their offering of hospitality. Deplorable
as it may seem to establish such a pre
cedent, the deterioration of manners in
society must not be condoned, hence
the heroic question, "Are you coming?"
The fast-approaching date for the de
parture of Miss Pearl Sabin and Miss
Irene Sabin is bringing to them many
hospitalities given by their friends,
who would see much of them while
here. Mrs. Redmond Payne will enter
tain In honor of Miss Irene Sabin in the
near future, and several other events of
indefinite date are on the tapis.
Miss Jessie Wopple of Los Angeles,
who has been visiting in San Fran

THIEF RIFLES
TICKET CASE
Somewhere in this city a squad of
burglars Is preparing to enjoy Christ
mas on money stolen from the Cen
tral Theater. Some time before the
break of dawn Sunday, the ticket case
fit the Central had yielded the contents
of the advance matinee sale drawer,
$!26 in all, to the chief villain in a
r^al-life drama.
Bulging in the recesses of the cash
receptacle were dimes and quarters to
a total of $218. but the burglar did
not take it all.
Sunday forenoon one of the clerks
at the theater rang up Manager Davis
end asked him if he had taken the
money out of the drawer. Mr. Davis
informed the clerk that he had not
end was told that some one had come
in the night and relieved him of the
trouble.
Detectives found that entrance had
been pained over the steel gate that
stretches across the foyer near the
Ftreet. The height of this gate and
the fact that the district is well lighted
demonstrated that several men must
have "turned the trick." After see
ing that no policeman was near the
man that was to rifle the ticket case
was boosted over the gate and then
the rest was easy.
A sliding door leading into the box

crawled through a small wicket in an
Iron screen that was supposed to bar
the way to the ticket case and with
hammer and chisel broke the lock and
took the coin. Then he replaced the*
lock and fled.
The janitor and watchman left the
thtrater at 4 o'clock Sunday morning
nnd between that hour and daylight
the crime was probably committed.
"The burglary was committed by
pome one well acquainted with our
habits." said Mr. Davis. "He knew

to be found. As a rule we put the
receipts in the safe each night, but

Special Dispatch to The CatL
JACKSONVILLE, Or., Decl 19.âBe
cause they only received a nickel each
as a reward for finding a tin can con
taining $7000 ten years ago O. and C.
P. Danielson have begun suit for a
more generous share of the prize. In
March, 1SS4, the young men, at that
time eleven and nine years of a,ge re
spectively, while engaged, at the re
quest of Dee Roberts, in cleaning out
an old henhouse, uncovered a tin can,
worn with age and -covered with rust,
containing- small cloth sacks filled with
sold coins to the amount of $7000.
The boys immediately reported the
find to their employer, who, after he
had counted it, went to the boys and
told them he had buried it In the hen
house a short time before for safe
keeping and that he intended to un
cover it and buy something with it
shortly. He gave each of the boys 5
cents and told them to, say nothing
cf the occurrence and promised that
the Lord would bless them.
As the boys grew older they became
convinced, that the money did not be
long to Dee Roberts and that by right
it should be theirs. In March, 1902,
they brought suit against the defend
ant to recover possession of the gold
and $5000 interest on the same.
The case was tried in Jackson Coun
ty in 1&02 and resulted in a verdict for
the defendant. It was appealed to the
Supreme Court, which reversed the de
cision. It was tried here again and the
jury, after being out fifteen hours, dis
agreed, nine standing for the plaintiffs
and three for the defendant.

SAILOR GARB BRINGS
WOE TO BEGGAR
Face and Hands Belie His
Tale of Nation's Neglect
Runs Against Policeman in Disguise
BY JAMES O. CRAWFORD.
When he begged, borrowed or stole the
garb of a man-o'-war Jackie John J.
Kane, professional vagabond, Imagined
that by 'donning it, assuming 1 a rolling
gait and larding his language . with
idioms of the sea he would be enabled
to Impose upon the philanthropy that
is akin to patriotism. It was his belief
that especially at this Christmas time,
when the spirit of giving is rampant,
no deaf ear would be turned to the ap
peal of a naval hero who had run afoul
of hard luck, for such was the role he
cut out | for himself, and to make as
sured success doubly sure he decided to
rehearse the part on the Barbary Coast
â try it on the dog, as it wereâ before
venturing it on the more promising
sections of the city. While he did not
expect to glean much cash from the
habitues of the coast, by whom it is
considered more blessed to take than
to give, he felt compensated for that
anticipation by the knowledge that if
; their sharpened faculties failed to de
: tect his imposture he could safely ven
ture it on the less sophisticated deni
zens of the respectable residence dis
tricts. So he felt that the time Invest
ed in the experiment was not wastedâ
nor would it have been, perhaps, if he
j had devoted more care to physical de
tail in his makeup. His hands and face
belled his apparel and the narrative
i prefacing his petition for alms. * . .
Swaggering down lower Pacific street
as 4t the sidewalk were heaving like
the deck of a vessel breasting a billowy
sea, Mr. Kane spat tobacco juice co
piously, hitched his trousers frequently
and hailed likely-looking passers-by.
"Belay there, mate," was his form of
greeting. "Lay to an' listen to de story
of a galyant 'Merican seaman In dis
tress. I fit an' bled for Ole Glory wld
Dooey at Manillar, I did. an' it's an
orficer on de bridge of a battleship I'd
be t'day if an ongrateful country 'ud do
| its dooty as well as I done mine."
', If the person thus accosted evinced
i interest sufficient to invite further
| communication Mr. Kane unfolded a
' tale of unrewarded heroism, that sel-
Idom failed to bring the desired mone-
tary contribution.
Several wideawake coastersâ men
who prided themselves on their ability
to unmask pretense â had thus been
taken in and done for when Mr. Kane
m^t his Waterloo in the shape of a
Vlain-clothes patrolman. Himself dis
guised, the mendicant neglected to con
sider that other persons might be simi-
! lorly attired to deceive, and when he
i hooked his right index finger in a gap
ing buttonhole of the coat worn by a
burly man In artisan's costume he had
no misgiving, but unloaded his intro
ductory speech with unrestrained free
dom and glibness. "I still love de ole
flag," he appended to his stereotyped
plaint of a nation's ingratitude, "an 1
am more sorrier for de'land of me birth
dan I'm angry at her." So passively
was his appeal listened to that he felt
a coin subscription was as good as Be
cured, which feeling of confidence made
his nerves jangle all the more fiercely
when the. stranger abruptly grasped his
shoulder, shook him vigorously and ex
claimed:
"W'y, ye bloated bum, what are ye
tryin' to work off on me, eh? You a
sailor, with a mug sweating whisky,
an' hands like a milliner's? W'y, ye
copper-plated vag, ye never did a day's
work in yer life, ashore or afloat!
What Jackie did ye rob of them rags,
eh? Come on, ye soak!"
As the burly man shook the chatter
ing Mr. Kane with one hand he dis
played a silver-plated star with the^
other, and without further ado hauled'
the bogus mariner to prison. There
it was ascertained from an investiga
tion of the records that under various
aliases â Smith, apparently, preferred
the prisoner had several previous
convictions for vagrancy and begging.
Police Judge Mogan will sentence him
to-day.

John Maguire, accused of failing to
provide for his four minor children,
inadvertently confessed ownership of
$20, which had been taken from him
when he was searched at the Central
station, and Judge Fritz sent for the
money and handed it to the defend
ant's N slster. who had been preserving:
the little ones from starvation.
"This is the children's season," said
his Honor, "and It's you, Mr. Maguire,
instead of me that should be playing
Santa Claus for your offspring."
Mr. Maguire obtained relase on pro
bation by promising to shun his pa
ternal responsibilities no more.
James McLaughlin, charged with
expectorating in a public place, said
he was rather 1 deaf when Judge Ca
baniss requested him to plead.
"I'm hard o' hearin'S" he shouted.
In a tone that was audible on Kearny
street.
"Sorry to hear you can't hear," re
sponded the Judge; "but what Is your
answer to this complaint?"
"Ye betcher life it's a bad com
plaint!" yelled the defendant, with
hands behind ears. "I've had it twen
ty year, an' it's gettjn 1 worse right
along." . t
The remainder of the court's com
munications to Mr. McLaughlin were
written arid handed to him by the
clerk.
Possession of one striped bass of
weight less than three pounds cost
Ah Bing, a flsh dealer in Chinatown,
the sum of 8150, exclusive of attor
ney's fees. Judge Conlan imposed the
fine.
James Reece was stealing a potted
palm from the porch of Thomas Ash
worth's residence, 900 McAllister
street, at 4 o'clock yesterday, when
Patrolman Graham nabbed him. An
other policeman testified that the de
fendant lived at Fifth and Shipley
streets. No defense was offered, and
Reese will be sentenced to-day for
petty larceny. Once upon a time he
was a member of the Chicago police
force, and report has it that he did
valiant service during the famous
Haymarket riot.
Britton street, Visitation Valley, is
again convulsed by the CotelH-Gambozi
vendetta. The release on probation of
SJgnora Cotelli, clearly convicted of
having disturbed the peace of Signora
Gambozi, was accompanied by an ad
monition from Judge Conlan so im
pressive that all present thought It
would have the desired deterrent effect,
and the Italian interpreter, through
whom it was filtered, informed the
court that not in all his official career
had he seen the subject of a judicial
warning more thoroughly intimated.
Indeed he offered to wager four of his
favorite cigars to one of the brand pre
ferred by Clerk "Jack" Rice that never
again would the door of that tribunal
be darkened by the entrance of Sig
nora Cotelli as a defendant. Mr.- Rice
rejected the proposal on the ground
that it did not mean odds. If he had
accepted it he would have won, for
Signora Cotelli, after a three weeks'
absence, reappeared yesterday in her
former role and was accused -of the
same offense by the same complainant.

Accompanying- Signora Cotelli was

Nina had* reopened the inter-family
emeute by addressing uncomplimen
tary allusions to Signora Gambozi
every time that matron ventured
abroad, and complaint of the girl's
conduct to her mother seemingly pro
voked the latter to disregard of the
Judge's caution, for her oral retorts
were hardly less frightful than the

WATKINS GOES
TO HIS TRIAL
Another Diamond Invest
ment Man to Face Jury for
Mailing Letters to Dupes
HE ACCUSES OFFICIALS
Says That Employes of Los
Angeles Postoffice Were
Also Implicated in Scheme
O. J. Watkins. reputed by Postofflo*
Inspector O'Connell to be one of the
smoothest operators of get-rlch-qulck
schemes in the State, was brought
from San Jose yesterday ,by Deputy
United States Marshal Dingley on. an
indictment presented by the . Federal
Grand Jury at Los Angeles, where he
will be taken for trial. The indict
ment charges Watkins with having on
February 4, 1903, devised a scheme to
defraud Walter W. Fisher, P. W. Ross,
Wallace I. Brooks and George Wich
huscn on a weekly installment plan,
the victims being promised a diamond
valued at $100 or that sum in cash.' It
is further alleged that in pursuance of
such scheme, Watkins deposited in the
postofTlce at Los Angeles a letter ad
dressed to P. W. Ross. Tke concern
,was called The International Credit
Company of Los Angeles.
Watkins said after his arrest that
Frank C. Mulkey, secretary of the
Civil Service Board in the Los Ange
les postoffice, was head "of the con
cern, while he himself was general
manager.
He said also that Ross was paymas
ter in the postofflce there, and that
last April Ross walked into Watkina'
office and demanded of the stenogra
phers that they should cash his con
tract under penalty of having the con
cern's 'mail stopped.
"I own a 240-acre ranch in Los An
geles," added the prisoner, "and they
thought it would be a good thing to
arrest me about the Christmas holi
days, so that they could shake me
down. Since my arrest they have
telegraphed me that they would settle
the case on payment of $70."
Inspector O'Connell said that Wat
kins was the head of the Maturity In
vestment Company of this city, and
thRt the postal authorities drove him
out of town by issuing a fraud order
and stopping his mail. Watkins then
removed to San Jose j and started the
San Jose Investment Company on the
same lines as the others.
Watkins waived examination before
United States Commissioner Heacock
yesterday and was ordered removed
to Los Angeles. His bail was fixed at
$2000, but the prisoner was unable to
furnish bonds.

nora Gambozi's welfare alone were
menaced, the complaint might not
have been filed; but for reasons which
were obvious her protection from un
pleasantness was imperatively de
manded.
The Judge expressed desire to have
Signora Gambozi tell her story in
ccurt to-day, and there is probability
that his desire will be gratified.

Arthur Graham of Oakland, charged
with violating the anti-expectoration
ordinance, told Judge Fritz that he
was aware of the illegality of deposit
ing salivary offerings upon the side
walks of the city across the bay, but
had no idea that so metropolitan a
restriction existed in San Francisco.
Despite the jar to his Honor's local
patriotism, he visited no severer pun
ishment that a reprimand upon the
audacious Oaklander. â  ,

Judge Cabaniss called Mme. Vera
Franz to the witness stand and asked
whether she tlesired him to punish or
release Robert O'Smith. accused of
blackening her eye when she sought
to prevent his removal from her
maison on Post street of a trunk.
"It has been proved," his Honor
suggested, "that while he was bruising
your eye your finger-nails were plow-
Ing deep furrows in his cheeks."
"I care not for zat," the lady ex
claimed. "He* bust my eye fust, an*
I vant heem to have ze hard sen'
taince."
So he was fined $10. Mme. Franz
subsequently explained to an audience
In the corridor that her implacable
prosecution of Mr. O'Smith was pro
voked less by the eye-blackening than
by his statement in court that she
annoyed him by bestowing tender at
tentions which he could not return.
"Lof heem? Ze ver-ay idea! Ha,
ha!" she shrilled.

FROWN ON GAME
"ALUMNI" PLANS
University Authorities Is
sue Ukase Disapproving
Contest With Southerners
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, Dec. 13.
The university authorities to-day put
their official foot down on the scheme
of university football men to get up a
game with the Sherman Institute In
dians at Los Angeles on New Year's
.day. Orders were issued directing that
no student of the university take any
part in the proposed contest, which,
according to the university officials^ is
being prepared by persons who are
usir.g the university's name without
warrant.
Professor George C. Edwards, chair
man of the faculty committee on ath
letics, to-day issued the following state
ment, which had been previously ap
proved by President Wheeler:
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKE
LEY. December 1ft, 190*. â It !â¢ reported that
an anrrecatlon of person*, students and others
under the cam* of â¢'University cf California |
Alumni Team," Is proposing to take part In a
football contest with the â¢'fc'herman Indian â¢
Teaia" at Los Angeles about the beginning of I
the new year. Attention 1b called to the fact â 
that the u*Â« of the name cf the university, cr '
that of the alumr.l. Is being made â¢without any j
authority whatever. Furthermore, it is very
untfeeiratile. for many reasons, that under
irraduates shouid lend themselves to any euch
scheme.
Therefore, Uie faculty committee on athletics
hereby orders that no student of this univer
sity taks part in the proposed contest.
tSignetf) GEORGE C. EDWARDS. " â¢
Chairman Committee -on Athletics.
The following men are understood
to have been interested in arranging, for
the game at Los Angeles with the In
dians: Overall, Smith,
"Mln" Greisberg and Hudson, alumni;
Heitmuller, Howard. Snedigar and
Haffey. varsity men of this year's team.
Two months ago the managers of the
Indian team corresponded with Man
ager Decoto of the varsity team asking
for a game on Christmas day. The re
quest was granted, but later It was
found that the varsity men were in
poor condition and that a representa
tive team could not be sent south. The
executive committee of the Associated
Students then decided to call the affair
off, offering .to send a second eleven,
however. The last proposal apparently
did not satisfy the Southern California
men. and it was supposed at the uni
versity that the entire affair was off
until the news was heard a , few days
;jgo that "alumni" were getting togeth
er a "university" team to play the In
dians. â¢ â¢ ....â â  \ â -....
WEIIE CRCTI* TO CHILDREN'.â Jamee De-
Unry and bis wife. I -aura. Delaney. of 1140 A
Howard street, were arrented last night by W.
H. Toun* and 1!. J. White of the California
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren. The Delanrys are accused or maltreat
ice their three minor. children. Both man and
woman have been drunk for day*. Mrs. Dela
r,Â«y aerved several months in the County Jail
u. year tro tor the same offense for which eba
and her husband were arrested yesterday.- ThÂ«
children were cent to thÂ» new Detention Home
vt the Juvenile Court.
When Jimmy BrJtt and Battling^Nel-
Bon step into the ring at Me
chanics' Pavilion to-night the fol
lowers of the fistic game will undoubt
edly have the pleasure of witnessing
one of the greatest fights in which lit
tle men have ever participated. There
is every indication that the battle will
be strenuously fought, for both men
are trained to the moment and accus
tomed to battle from the clang of the
gong.*
The result bf the conflict will mean
fame and fortune .for the winner, and
a place among the second-raters for
I the man who gets second money.
Should the Californian climb out of
the ring with a decision or a knockout
over the champion of Hedgewich, he
will undoubtedly be heralded and rec
ognized as the greatest man of his
weight in the world.
On the other hand, if Nelson happens
to stop the sturdy plumber boy with
those ever effective lunges which have
gained for him such a name, the sport
ing world will experience the pleasure
of greeting a new champion â one who
had risen out of obscurity to the top
notch of the ladder of fame within the
short space of -little more than a single
year. -^
The betting of course favors the Cal
ifornian. Last night his friends and
admirers were willing to wager 10 to
7 that he would leave the ring to-night
a victor over the great Dane. There
was plenty of Nelson money in sight
at these odds, and from present indica- '
tions the men will enter, the ring with
Britt selling at .10 to 7 or perhaps 10
to 6%, or maybe 10 to- 6.
V -"' INTEREST IX FIGHT.
The fight was the main topic of con
versation all along . the line yesterday.
Every one seemed to be interested" in
the outcome, and there were many sup
porters of both boxers in evidence
every place where sporting men are
wont to congregate. Some are of the
opinion that Britt can outbox the Dane
and land his terrible punches to the
body at the same time, while others
| think that Nelson is capable of taking
all the beating the Californian is able
to, administer and - still be strong
j enough to make a hurricane finish.
t' * It looks as if Britt is figuring on
fighting a cautious battle. He does not
express an opinion either way, .but
| everything goes to show that he will
I stand off and fight the Dane from a
I distance and take a chance of landing
; a telling wallop every time a likely op
j portunity presents itself. This is the
way in which' he has fought^'
j other ' alleged "touch 'proposition's" in
j the past and it is not unlikely that he
j will adopt the same. tactics this time,
j Both men were below the required
j weight yesterday afternoon and there
is no doubt that they will weigh in
safely under 132. pounds when 6
o'clock rolls around to-night The
work of both men practically came to
an end yesterday afternoon and they
will Just take enough exercise to-day
to keep them down to weight.'
Britt took, a long spin on the road
and after a brisk rundown announced
that he was through with hard toll.
He stepped on the scales after finish
ing up and weighed about 131%
pounds. He seemed satisfied with the
result and said ' he would take a row

said Jimmy. "Just say for me that I
am in better shape for this fight than
I have ever been in my life before and.
if I do not win I will have no fault
to find. I am of the opinion that I can
beat Nelson, but that remains to be
seen. I promise to do. my best and
may the best man win."
Al. Herford, manager of Joe Gans,

colored lightweight. 1 Herford has
much .to say In regard to GansMack

yesterday morning and spent the. day
writing letters and doing little odds and
ends â¢ around the camp. A walk to
Larkspur Canyon was the only exer
cise indulged in. In the afternoon he
mounted the scales and tipped the
beam at 130%.
NELSON CAMP CONFIDENT.
A report has been' circulated in the
East that Battling broke his arm while
training, but such a report is without
foundation. Battling's training mates
have various opinions regarding the
result of the battle. Eddie Santry
says ten rounds. "Rawhide". Kelly
says Battling will finish, Britt before
ten rounds.
Marvin Hart says: "I don't know
how many founds it will go, but Bat
tling wil certainly cop the coin."
To-day Nelson will leave Larkspur
at. 2:03 p. m. and. come to San Francis
co and wait for the time to weigh in.
He said last night: .
"I couldn't be in better condition for
this fight if I was made to order. I've
had an easy time making the weight
and feel as strong as a bull. I've
waited nearly two years for a crack at
Britt, and expect to bring home the
money In about the sixteenth or twen
tieth round. I don't . see where Jimmy
has it on me any. If I lose, I will have
no excuses to offer."
Manager Murphy . says: "I have
watched Battling closely 'during this
spell of training and know he could
not be. in better shape. I think he will
get Britt'in about fourteen or eighteen
rounds." V
Nothing takes the conceit out of some
men like being compelled â  to serve on
a jury.
HANDICAP WILL BE

A handicap at six and a half furlongs

Misty 's ; Pride Downs Andrew B. Cook
in a Very Fast Run Race.
BY FRED E. SIUIiHOIiliAND.
: The two great mares. Dainty and
Honiton, met on equal terms In the
last race of the day at Oakland yes
terday, over seven and a half furlongs.
Dainty not only defeated the. daughter
of the dead s Ormonde with apparent
ease, but at the same time, in covering
the distance in 1:32 fiat, she established
a new American record, supplanting
the 1:32 1-5 of Rag Tag, made at Wash
ington Park, Chicago, on July 1, 1903.
Although there were half a dozen
starters, it looked strictly a two-horse
race, and the others received little con
sideration from* the* big crowd. Honi
ton had already been a winner on three
separate occasions, while the race
marked the first appearance this sea
son of Dainty. This fact caused
"Packey" Kyan's entry to enjoy the
call for a time in the betting. But
Walter Jennings gave put * that his
mare was right on edge and the latter
eventually closed favorite, after 7 to 5
at one stage being obtainable. Jakie
Jone3 had the leg up on Honiton and
started off with the lead. Davis kept
the favorite well up and before the
stretch bend was reached collared and
passed Honiton. From that time on
there was nothing to*it, Dainty win
ning as she pleased by a length at the
wire. Toledo ran a good third.
Favorites did not fare very well, for
Misty's Pride was the only other public
choice besides Dainty to take a purse.
Of the different winners, Bard Burns,
at 15 and 20, was the star long shot.
Bearskin is experiencing a difficult
time in leaving the maiden class. The
Rainbow colt was installed favorite for
the introductory six and a half furlong
scramble and brought from next to last
position by Michaels, lost by a neck
to the â < to 1 chance, Lily Golding.
After cutting out all the early pace.
Tar Baby, a 20 to 1 shot, ran a good
third.
Two steaming hot ones were cut loose
In the Futurity c6urse run, for two
year-olds, which followed, In Bologna
and Fleetwood. The latter*s price fell
under a steady play from threes to 9
to 5 favoritism, and the best Larsen
could do was to drop the colt in fourth.
Bologna, ridden by Sherwood, had
speed to burn, and backed down from
JAMES LOWERS LEVY'S ,
COLORS AT HANDBALL-
Cracks of Two Classes Play Some In
teresting Games In Olympic
Club Courts.
George James had an easy time de
feating Louis Levy In the soft ball
handball tournament at the Olympic
Club last evening. James played In
rare form, placing the ball wherever
he pleased and driving it with terrific
speed. Levy did his best, but was un
able to keep up the fast pace set by
his opponent. A return match is
looked for in the tournament. "Scores:
21 â 11, 21 â 12.
Fred Sherry went down to defeat at
the hands of. Robert B. Bain in the
second class. This game was the fast
est one of the night, and was full of
long rallies and back-court work.

BEFORE TERRIBLE, WOODS
Bobby Johnson Makes Jockey Quit
With a Stiff Punch to
the Body.
STOCKTON, Dec. 19. â Bert Weller
of Nevada laid down before Billy
Woods, the crack Los Angeles welter
weight. In the first round of what waa
to have been a twenty-round fight to
night at Masonic Temple. The men
had not been In the ring a minute
when it became apparent to the crowd
that Weller was outclassed. The spec
tators yelled for "a run for their
money," and Woods tried to give it to
them, but Weller did not have It in
him, and took advantage of the first
opportunity to drop to the floor. He
went down from a light left-hand jab
and refused to get up.
By far the best fight of the night
was that between Bobby Johnson, the
San Francisco feather-weight, and
Jockey Bennett. Bennett received a
stiff left in the stomach in the four
teenth round and sank to his knees.
"He could not get up again. He claimed
a foul, but Referee Eckhardt prompt
ly disallowed it and awarded the fight
to Johnson.

Toyo Risen Kaishds New Boats to Go Twenty-One Knots
Liners Will All

i
The Toyo Kisen Kaisha, whose steam- t
phips, the Hongkong, Am*rk-a and Nip- J
jxjn Mam, were taken from the peace- !
I ul- paths of commerce for use with the!
Japanese navy, will soon be in the field '
again with three new, fast ocean liners. \
"When the Minnesota called at Coronel '
among the visitors on board the big ;
<Jreat Northern boat was W. H. Avery,;
fhe general agent here for the Japanese j
line. Avery has been doing some ex- â 
tensive traveMng during the last few I
months. He has been in New York, !
Kngland, Scotland and was in Chile on
lÂ«usiness for his company when the ,
Minnesota left. From Avery was :
'learned Fomething of the company's j
plans. *
Within two months work will begin ,
â Â«.*i three 12.000-ton steamships. The ma- â¢
"*vrial for the liners has been bought
In Scotland. The vessels will be built;
ii Negtsaki. It was the original inten- j
iion to build the liners with a speed of .
nineteen knots. The Japanese Govern- |
.j:!ent. however, wants the Toyo Kiseri
Kaisha to build faster boats â at least â 
iwenty-oue knutters. As this addition- j
Si two knots will involve considerable j
QEtra expense the steamship company \
Yias asked for a greater subsidy than it :
â¢was originally agreed to give them. |
This is now under consideration at To- !
. kÂ«u. and as soon as it is sctled the keels i
of the liners will be taid.
'It has nut been announced whether or j
?ioc the new boats will lake the place of ;
the three boats called in by the Japa- â¢
ncse Government in the m joint trans-:
1'atilic schedule. They may run inde
pendently of the boats of the Pacific
â¢iiail and Occidental and Oriental
steamship companies, or they may .
irake a different run. Instead of run- '

HER THIRD SUIT
IS FOR SUPPORT
Edith Dunpliy Now Demands
Allowance From Clubman,
as Separate Maintenance
I5E.H1ND CLOSED D00ES
Trial of Kowalsky Case Is
Begun Before Judge Sloss.
Butcher's Wife Divorced
A third falllng-out between Edith M.
Dunphy and James M. Dunphy, club- i
man and ranch owner, is apparent from j
the complaint filed yesterday-- by Mrs. i
Dunphy demanding $250 a month from
her husband as separate maintenance j
and for $1500 attorney's fees. . . . " j
The Dunphys were married on "" Janu- |
ary 3 of- last year, it being her third j
matrimonial venture. Last spring she |
sued him for divorce on the ground of
cruelty, and her. accusations were sen- |
sational. They ! made ud and she did I
not press the case; but' toward the end \
of the summer she filed a supplemental \
complaint, repeating the former charges
and adding new.'instances of. alleged:
brutal treatment. She also intimated j
the expected arrival of a Dunphy heir. !
In yesterday's action the grounds of j
the other complaints are gone over, and
in addition she says. that on October 19 1
last, art Carlin, Nsy., in the presence of i
others, he made vile charges against her, j
and on November -3, at the Hotel Bal- !
tlmore, in this city, he threatened to j
kick her and declared that he was not j
the father of their unborn child.' The j
wife says Dunphy is worth $200,000. Her
attorneys are Sullivan & Sullivan.
The divorce case of Ettie Kowalsky
against Joseph Kowalsky was called
for trial in Judge Sloss' court yesterday
morning, and after the reading of the
pleadings a continuance was taken. ,J.
C. Campbell, attorney, for Ettie Kowal
sky, the plaintiff, moved -that the hear
ing be had behind closed doors. The
defendant is represented by his brother,
Colonel H. I. Kowalsky, and Attorney
Crowley.
The Kowalskys were married on
February 22, .1893, and lived, for
j awhile at the Baldwin, then moved to"
j 1316 Fulton street. Kowalsky was a
; shoe dealer but now deals in stocks.
I His wife charged him with cruelty and
j penuriousness. - After allegations re
' garding his physical "condition, -she
j t-Tiarged that he .allowed her as little
i as ?2 a week,;and When she asked for
| more, cursed and reviled her and made
I her account for the expenditure of that
j paltry sum. She said that he frequent
j ly ordered her to leave, the house, and
on May 20 of last year she left him.
She said that her husband was worth
$100,000 and had an income of $650 a
month of which she wanted $250 a
month for alimony.
In his answer and cross-complaint
Kowalsky denied the charges of cruel
ty and penuriousness. He said that his
wife told him that she would rather
kill herself than become a mother.
He denied that he was worth more
than $38,600 and that his income was
more than $260 a month.
An interlocutory decree of divorce
was granted by Judge Hunt to Mary
E. Seyner. from Joseph Seyner, a butch
cr, on the ground, of extreme cruelty.
They were married in 188S and she
testified that he made her spend her
days in the shop, keeping books, and
was brutal to her. often threatening
to kill her and himself. Seyner is
worthabout $14,000. and the property
interests 'of the pair were settled out
ot court. Divorces were granted by
Judge Kerrigan to Emile Frankard
from Maria Frankard for infidelity; by
Judge Hunt to Mary E. Beach from
Edward T. Beach, neglect; by Judge
Hebbard to Minnie A. Ayer from Ed
ward A. Ayer, neglect.
Suits for divorce were filed by Jos
oph Mclaughlin against Annie J. Me-
Latughlin, intemperance and cruelty;
Daisy Smith against Wilfred Smith,
rtglect and desertion.
CHARGES PARA WITH FORGERY.â Miss
May Mathena. alla9 Gladys Freeman, obtained
a warrant yesterday for the arrest of Louis
Para for forgery. About two months ago
Para had Miss Mathena arrested on, a charge
of felony eirtbezzlement. He alleged that he
rave her a pair of diamond earrings valued at
$200 on a signed agreement that she would
upturn the articles on demand. The case was
dismissed by Judge Cabaniss as It was, proved
liy Theodore Kytka, the handwriting expert,
that Miss Mathena's signature had been forged.

MEN WHO WANT
TO BE SPEAKER
Assemblyman A. M.^Drew of
Fresno May Enter the Con
test for the Coveted Post
PKESCOtr IN THE LEAD
Senators Wolfe and Leavitt
Compete for the Honor
of Presiding in the Senate
There la an undercurrent of gossip in j
places where the politicians assemble |
that Governor Pardee has signified in 'â 
some way that General Frank C. Pres- j
cott of San Bernardino is the most ac- ;
ceptable of the candidates for Speaker j
of the Assembly. As affairs now stand j
Prescott seems to have an advantage j
over his rivals, but there is talk that j
the campaign- for the election of. United j
States Senator may become so interest- â¢
ing before the Legislature convenes '
that the programme for the Speaker- ,
ship will be revised. i
Assemblyman A. M. Drew of Fresno :
was at the Union League Club yester- j
day and met a number of Republican '
leaders. He is mentioned as a probable !
candidate for Speaker, and many of i
the statesmen insist that of all the can- !
didates spoken of he is surely the most j
capable. ' j
The story that the Governor has ex- i
pressed a preference for Speaker Is
taken with some grains of allowance. ;
It is well understood that the chief ;
executive officer of the State desires i
the election of a Speaker, with, suffi- j
cient tact and firmness to prevent the |
Assembly from running wild on appro
priations of money.
Efforts to get the "organization" in-!
terested in the contest for the position!
of President pro tem. of the Senate
have so far proved unavailing. It is .
the idea of some statesmen that the .
organization consists of the chairman I
of the Republican State Committee and j
the leading contributors to the cam- !
paign fund of the party. Others hold '
that the law department of the South
ern Pacific is an element of the or- j
ganization. Whatever it is, it has not {
yet' taken sides with either Senator
Wolfe or Senator Leavitt in their con
test for the prestige of presiding in the
Senate during the absence of Lieuten
ant Governor Anderson. !
Senator I Wolfe In presenting the
claims of San Francisco for recogni
tion points to the magnificent majority
which this citv gave to the Republican
party In the recent election.
Senator Leavitt, hailing from Ala
meda. claims that his county, which
regularly rolls up handsome Republican
majorities in wet seasons and dry sea
sons, should be no longer overlooked in
the award of patronage. There is a
vigorous shout that Alameda Is entitled
to recognition.
LJEUTEXANT RICHARDS* CASE
IS STIJLIi HANGING FIRE
Army Board Convenes, but Is Ad
journed on Account of Retire
ment of Colonel Glrard.
The case of Lieutenant G. S. Rich
ards Jr. is once again before the pub
lic eye. The retiring board appointed
to look into the question of his san
ity convened yesterday In the offices
of the judge advocate in the Phelan
building.
Richards was in court, accompan
ied by his attorney, Ralph L*. Hath
orn. Colonel Charles Morris is pres
ident of the board, and Captain John
J. Bradley is recorder for the court.
Nothing was done in the case for the
reason that Captain Bradley requested
that Colonel A. C. Girard retire from
the board, because Coionel Girard
had been a member of the
original court-martial that tried
Lieutenant Richards. Captain Brad
ley's position was sustained and Col
onel Girard retired from the court.
Nothing further can be done in this
seemingly tndless case until the au
thorities in Washington advise whit
medical officer shall take the place of
Colonel Girard.
General MacArthur will make his
tour of inspection of the posts in the
Northwest early in- January. Gen
eral Francis Moore has not yet def
initely decided when he will go to in
spect the district of Honolulu, but it
will probably be about the middle of
January.

SCHOOLS USED
BY THE CHURCH
Classes in Keligion Held
in Utah After Regular
Work for the Day Is Over
APOSTLE TAKES STAXD
He Says It Will Require a
Eevelation "to Put a Stop
to Polygamy of Mormoni
WASHINGTON, Dec 19.â The Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
to-day, in the Smoot inevstlgatlon. de
veloped, by the statements of A. C.
Nelson, Superintendent of Pubiio In
struction of Utah, some facts concern
ins the use of school buildings for thÂ«
teaching of the Mormon religion.
Apostle John Henry Smith was on iha
stand for two hours. Other witnesses
were Isaac Birdsall, a Mormon, who
said that his daughter was excom
municated because she would not obey
a decision of a bishop's court which
had deprived her of a piece of property
to which she had the lawful title, and
William Balder 3 ton. editor of the 'Boise
(Idaho) Statesman, who testified in re
gard to the political affairs in his State.
Chairman Burrows drew from
Apostle Smith some statistics relating
to the church, but no register of the
total membership. In regard to colon
ization. Apostle Smith said there is a
largo settlement in Mexico and that
one-third of the population of Idaho
and one-fourth of the population of
Wyoming are Mormons. Other States
and Territories having -large settle
ments are Nevada, California, Arizona,
Colorado and New York, while Iowa
has a large settlement of the reorgan
ized Church of Latter Day Saints,
which drew away from the other
church because it did not believe In
polygamy.
REVELATION" NECESSARY.
Apostle Smith said that the suspen
sion of the practice of polygamy was
the result of a revelation and that It
would take another revelation to put
It in force.
"Then the president of the church
might put polygamy In practice by re
ceiving a revelation?"
"Not unless the people should receive
it. Nothing is forced on the Mormon
people," he replied.
At the afternoon session Isaac B!rd
sall. formerly' a Mormon, said he sev
ered his connection with the Mormon
church at the time his daughter was
offered rebaptlsm if she would convey
her property to one Leavitt, but could
not give the date.
William Budge of Paris, Idaho, was
recalled by counsel for Smoot. He
said that as a bishop of the Mormon
church he has not entertained a case
involving the title of land for the rea
son that presidents of the church have
given instructions that bishops and
presidents of stakes could not hear
such cases.
MEMBERS FROM EUROPE.
Apostle Smith was recalled and ques
tioned by Chairman Burrows concern
ing the immigration from foreign coun
tries. He had testified that from one
third to one-half of the converts to tho
church came from Europe. The emi
grants, he said, are usually placed in
charge of an experienced man and
brought over on steamships with which
the foreign missionaries do business.
There are about four sailings a year,
he said.
To Tayler he said he was present at
the meeting at which Penrose was
elected an apostle. The fact that Mr.
Penrose was a polygamlst was not
mentioned or thought of. and he added:
"That question does not enter Into the
election. It is settled in our country
that the people must obey the laws of
the land."
"Do you?" said Tayler.
"Well, I try."
"But you have not succeeded very
well?" asked Chairman Burrows.
'Well, not so far."
Apostle Smith was then discharged
and William Baldorston. editor of the
Boise (Idaho) Statesman and formerly
connected with the Salt I.ako 'Times,
testified in regard to political condi
tions In Utah aboi:t the time of the is
suance of the Woodruff manifesto and
in Idaho after 1S91.
It was brought out by Taylpr that
the Attorney General of Idaho Is re
puted to have taken a plural wife with
in the last two or three years.
RELIGION' IN" SCHOOLS.
A. C. Nelson of Salt Lake. State Su
perintendent of Public Instruction and
a Mormon, was sworn. He Is now mak
ing an investigation of the extent in
which classes in religifjn are main
tained in the schools. Answers have
been received, he said, from all the
County Superintendents except three.
Classes are held In about 300 buildings.
These classes are assembled after the
adjournment of the regular school day,
which varies from 2:30 to 5 o'clock In
the afternoon.
Nelson read a letter which he had
sent to all school superintendents call-
Ing attention to a statute prohibiting
sectarian teachings In the public
schools. So far as he had information.
Nelson- said, the school teachers usual
ly taught the classes in religion.
On cross-examination Nelson was
asked if Senator Smoot had been ad
vised of matters relating to religion
classes.
"Well." answered the witness. "J/re
member meeting Senator Smoot and
telling him I v;as about to begin my in
vestigation, and that I believed the use
of the school buildings for religious
purposes was contrary to. law, and ha
said, 'Good, I am glad to hear it.' "
"Is that intended to be Senator
Smoot's answer on the witness stand?**
asked Tayler.
"It is well enough In an Investigation
in which he la the subject to have Sen
ator Smoot's name mentioned at least
once a week." responded Worthingtonl

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. 19.â The wheat .market
showed greatest strength eoon after the op?n
ine. On a good demand from commission
houses and local shorts, sentiment at the
start was bullish. Initial â  quotations on May
were up iÂ£c to %c at $1 10% to $1 11. The
main cause of the urgent demand was a sharp
fallinjr oft in receipts In the Northwest, An
other factor that entered into the situation,
however, was a decrease in the> amount on
passage, together with a decrease In world's
shipments. A noticeable feature of the statis
tics, of thÂ» world's movement was the HmnTl
nessof shipments from Russia. Advices from
Mlnneai>olls told of a good demand for cash
wheat. With ofterlnjrs light prices advanced
still further until May Bold up to $1 11^. For
a time the marlÂ»-t held firm. Late In the day
aentimÂ«nt became somewhat easier on profit
takin* and the market reacted. May closed
at $1 11.
The corn market was fairly firm. Majr
closed 14c higher at 45V4c.
A steady tone prevailed In the oat market.
May closed i*c higher at 81!4c.
Provisions were firm throughout the entire
session. At the close pork was up 10c, lard
and ribs were each 5c higher.

Poultry and Game.
Poultry opened the week with trade active
and the market in good shape for sellers. A
car of Western' stock was marketed early in
the forenoon and cleaned up readily, and three
additiooal cars that arrived liter met with a
good demand. There was practically no mar
ket for domestic stock, offerings being light
and the demand likewise. Game was In ample
supply and aside from a decline In small
.Ducks there were no changes In prices. Dressed
Turkeys were quiet at the old quotations. About i

and posted dealers hinted at possible unset

are not objecting to the advance. Cheese con

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The cold weather exerted a depressing In
fluence over the fruit market, trade In all
varieties, particularly Citrus kinds, being of
a hand-to-mouth character. There was not
enough business to warrant any change In
prices of . Navel Orange*. h|x. cars of which
were received. Dealers continued to report a
steady market for Apples, particularly good
medium stock. Stocks were Increased by five
carloads of fancy fruit from the north. Offer
ings' of Berries consisted wholly of the large
varieties, which sold slowly at a wide range.
Six chests came In. but there were about 20

Dr. J. Endicott Gardiner, acting In

a returning Chinese laborer named
Yee Mee. Yee arrived with four
women, one of whom. Lam Lin Yuk.
he claimed as his wife. He represent

merchants living here. He and hl3
alleged wife were allowed to land, but
the three women were detained for in
vestigation.
It was found afterward that Yee
Mee had .married a Chinese woman
named Kum Yow about three yeara
ago in this city and that Lam Lin Yuk
was not his lawful wife. It was as
certained also that Yee attempted to
marry another girl in Miss Lake'*
mission afterward, but that Miss Lake
refused her assent, finding that Yee
was a bad character. Then he l?ft
Tor. China and brought back the four

PADEREWSKI'S WORK
SHOWS INEQUALITIES
PIANIST NOT IN BEST . MOOD
Audience Is 'Enthusiastic One
Paderewskl was not in mood last
night at his Eecond recital of the sea
son. Perhaps the pianist was) cold.
There were a good many others of us
cold at the Alhambra last nightr, for it
v.-as "real New York" weather. Be
the reason what it may, it remains
that Paderewski was by no means up
to his Saturday form. Very reprehen
elble. no doubt, but until a pianist be
comes a pianola â which his chief charm
Is that he ien't-^-such contretemps may
be looked for. There were exquisite,
â¢.toning moments, of course, but as a
whole Mr. Paderewski has played much
better.
Curiously, this did not become ap
parent at the beginning of the pro
gramme. The Beethoven D minor
eonata, op. 31, that came second, was
delightfully played. The utmost no
bility of tone and^poise distinguished
the adagio, and the allegro was given
In most picturesque and impassioned
manner. A charming playfulness,
again, pervaded the rendering of the
aJlegretto. And what could be more
beautiful than the statement of the
opening theme in the Bach-Liszt A
Rilnor fugue that began the pro
gramme? Here was an exqulsiteness
cf musical diction â so to speak â a just
ness of accent, a beauty of tone, a
rhythmical Tightness that gave loveli
est value to the lovely phrase. It was
like a bit of "Phedre" done by Bern-

CURED BY CUTICURA

Writes Mother.
â¢â¢ I heretritb write oot in full the be-
finning and end of that terrible disease,
eczema which caused my babe untold
suffering and myself many sleepless
nights.
â¢ My babe waa born seemingly a fair,
healthy child, bat when she was three
weeks old a swelling appeared on the
berk o: her head, and In coarse of time
broke. It did not heal but grew worse,
and the sore spread from the sire of a
dime to that of a dollar I used all
kinds of remedies that I coald tiink of,
bui nothing seemed to help; in fact, it
grew worse. Her hair fell oct where
the sore was, and I feared It would never
grow again It continued until my aged
father came on a visit, and when he
saw the baby be told me to get Catl-
cura Soap and Ointment right away;
" To please him I did bo, and to my
surprise by their use the sore began to
heal over, the hair grew over it, and
to-day she has a nice bead of hair, her
skin it. as fair as a lily, and she has no
*car left to recall that awful sore, and
It 4Â« over eight months and no sign of
its returning."

"Cnre permanent." So writes Mrs.
Byer. Feb. 25, 1903, six years later:
â¢â¢ Your letter of the 19th inst. received,
askiog in regard to the cure of my baby
some six years ago. Well, the disease
has never returned to her head which it
that time was a solid sore on top and
down the back. Once or twice since

the wrist, but It finally disappeared
after proper treatment with Cutlcura."

hardt. And the whole Bach was
played In admirably luminous fashion,
â¢with tremendous power going to the
climaxes.
It was when the pianist came to
Schubert, in the little B 'flat impromp
tu, that the atmosphere sagged. I
have heard many people play it bet
ter. Even the tone was much want
ing and the whole reading was lack
ing in the vital sympathy with this
composer that so usually character
izes Paderewski. The Schubert-Liszt
"Hark, Hark the Lark" followed, and
perhaps the pianist felt about it as
some of us did, that the number is
slightly tiresome. He played It a little
that way. And then followed a mag
nificent "Erl King." This ended the
first group, which closed amid large
plaudits. To these was given as en
core one of the Mendelssohn songs
without words.
1 The G minor nocturne (op. 27) began
I the Chopin group. Here became more
evident the pianist's unlucky mood. It
v.as not like Chopin, not like Paderew
ski. He achieved a brilliant moment
j then in the G flat major study (op. 25),
that was effusively redemanded, again
â  played and again given noisy thanks
! for. In the mazurka, B flat minor,
â  that came next, one got Chopin, got
I Paderewski. It was most subtly poetic
in reading, divinely fine in rendering
and full of the distinction and elegance
that are the Polish pianist's in such
potent measure. Then there was a
waltz, with the "Berceuse," deliclously
played, as encore, the polonaise in A
flat (od. -53), brilliant but not evenly
great, and the A flat major waltz as en
core again, not wholly satisfying.
The melodie, op. 16, that represented
the pianist as composer, is a charming
little work. It was much appreciated.
Lizst again closed the programme and
it is worth while to hear Lizst with
Paderewski making over the rhapso
dies into poetry. The first rhapsody
was wildly encored and a second given,
and yet a third encore demanded and
given. The audience of last nightâ
with less reason than Saturday's to
applaud â certainly made up for the
coldness of that of the first recitar. It
was very large, almost filling the
theater and throughout noisily appre
ciative.
The third and last recital will be
given to-morrow evening.
And now, any one desirous of having
the Paderewski autograph may have it.
Paderewski says so. The price is $1,
with a measure or two of music 52. Go-
Ing, gping, gone! The proceeds go to
the Chopin memorial fund, for a monu
ment to be erected to the Polish com
poser at Warsaw, his birthplace. Any
time to-day. I believe, the bargain sale
of autographs Is on.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Alcazar.
"Peaceful Valley" certainly de
served a larger audience than wit
nessed its first presentation at the Al
cazar last night. The production of
the old-fashioned comedy maie fam
ous by Sol Smith Russell was credit
able in every respect and the company
for the most part was equal to the
artistic requirements "of the piece.
John Craig received an ovation on his
rt appearance after his indisposition
and again demonstrated Jiis ab'lity in
the part of Hosea Howe. He played
in a manner both natural and charm
ing and his comedy work was delight
ful. His make-up was tnis to the
part, although his creased trousers
and fancy hose In the second act are
hardly the fashion affected by a coun
try bumpkin. Miss Laura Adams
rrade a lovable old lady as Hosea's
rrolber, and her abiding faith in her
son v;as admirably shown. John B.
ifaher played Jotham Ford with his
accustomed Intelligence and hi3 paint
brush goatee and "Reuben"' dialect
created considerable amusement. Luke
Conness was happily cast as Jaok
Fnrquhar, and Harry Hilliard was 1m*

HOLDS M0NNIER
MAY BRING SUIT
Paper Admitted by Graham
Sets Up Legal Adoption
of the Winemakers Son
ISSUES ABE CHANGED
Contestant Admits Father's
Sanity-Defense Claims Un
due Influence Not Proved
With the exception of two short hear
ings of witnesses on behalf of George
Monnier, who is contesting the will oÂ£
his father, the late wine manufacturer,
the entire day in Judge Graham's court
was given over to the discussion by
counsel of technical points of law.
For two days the attorneys have
been fighting over the admission of the
adoption record of George Mopnier Jr.
At the beginning of yesterday's session
Judge Graham admitted the adoption
evidence on the ground that none of
the Monniers could question its legal
ity. If question was to be raised it
should be done by the unknown father,
whose absence is acknowledged In the
instrument.
Immediately upon the admission of
the adoption record Attorney Collins
moved that the testimony of the "trial
relating to the illegitimacy of George
Monnier be stricken from the record.
This was opposed by Sullivan and
Roche .in arguments which lasted the
greater part of the day.
The attorneys for the contestants
then agreed to the striking out of two
issues of the suit brought by the con
testant. These issues were the question
as to the due execution of the will and
the doubt as to the sanity of George
Monnier, deceased. Collins on his side,
however, added two more issues for the
decision of the court. He moved to
strike out of the record of the proceed
ings all testimony relating to the re
marks of the elder Monnier as to what
provision he intended making for his
son. He also moved to nonsuit the en
tire case on the ground no undue Influ
ence had been proved by the contest
ant. The collection of Issues will be ar
gued this morning at 10 o'clock and the
court will its decision.
Theodore Lutge, a former friend of
the elder Monnier, testified as to cer
tain admissions Monnier had made to
him regarding the illegitimacy of the
boy. His remarks were in line with the
testimony already given.
N. H. Lange, a local real estate man,
gave particulars as to the size, location
and value of the realty that comprises
the estate. He estimated that Its value
is $134,000, Excluding the handsome res
idence on Folsom street, between Nine
teenth and Twentieth.
H. Gilmour distinguished himself in the
role of the villain, Ben Murrell, who i
runs away with Bludso's wife and or- j
ganizes #i lynching party to string up
the hero. Eleanor Gordon was the bad
wife, and she succeeded in making the
character as vicious as the author
meant it to be. j Bludso falls in love '
with Kate Taggart, who is represented J
by Adele Block, but when the erring I
wife returns unrepentant and defiant j
the love idyll is interrupted. However, J
after the country becomes flooded and j
the steamer Prairie Belle, with Bludso i
as engineer, races down the Mississippi
the tangle becomes untangled, love tri
umphs and villainy meets poetic jus
tice.
Central.
Edna Ellsmere plays the leading role
in the "Two Little Waifs" at the Cen
tral this week In a charming manner.
She has a dual role, necessitating many
quick changes. Miss Ellsmere gives
one of the best performances ever seen
at the house. Herschel Mayall as the
father fills a short but exacting part.
Henry Shumer plays a good vllltdn.
The hits of the piece were Tempest J.nd
Sunshine, the two youngsters sent from
the Criterion Theater to play the waifs.
Both little tots show signs of careful
training, and this added to their ex
ceptional ability made one of the best
performances ever given by child
actresses in the West. Sunshine speaks
her lines with a great, clearness, and
Tempest, the older sister, acts with rare
Intelligence. Pryse Mackaye gave a
good performance, and Danny Halifax,
cast as the tough boy, and Myrtle
Vane, in the opposite part, gave clever
conceptions. The scenery Is far above
the average and shows many of the
sights familiar to the East.

DOLBEER CASE
BEING ARGUED
Johnson's Collar Wilts and
Voice Gives Out in Open
ing Address to the Jury
DWELLS MUCH ON FLAWS
Armand's Belated Deposition
Is Admitted and Lawyer
Declares It Is Perjury
The thunders of oratory now roll
over the heads of the jury in the Dol
beer will contest. The beginning was
made yesterday afternoon by Hiram
Johnson for the contestant, .and he
talked till his collar wilted to a rag
and his voice was all but out of serv
ice from his impassioned pleading.' He
will resume this morning, and after
he has concluded Garret W. McEner
ney will unlimber hiirt3elf In behalf
of proponents. Each side was allot
ted five hours for the argument. John
son will close late to-morrow after
noon, but the case may not go to the
Jury till the following morning, be
cause the instructions of the court
will remain to be given.
Judge Coffey's courtroom was
crowded to its utmost. The women
were on hand in large numbers. The
great contest over the â  estate of
$1,000,000 or more had reached the
point of hottest conflict, and the
throng was well rewarded by the spec
tacle, the satire and the humor.
JOIIXSOX ROASTS "SOCIETTY."
Johnson had much to say of "so
ciety." He went far into generalities
to show that the land fares ill where
wealth accumulates and men decay.
He held, up the proponents and their
witnesses to the jurors as members
of such society." ; ->
Stress was laid on the fact that
Miss Warren had not taken the stand,
for only she, Johnson declared, could
tell Intelligently of the mental condi
tion of Miss Dolbeer.
The argument, so far as it pro
ceeded yesterday, was devoted to tes
timony adduced by thÂ£ proponents.
The attorney, was frank in saying that
his case was strongest in the testi
mony given by witnesses for the pro
ponents and in the "negative testi
mony," that .which they did not pro
duce. In* behalf of the will there had
been four sins of omission in the trial
of the case, he said. William G. Mu
gan. Miss Dolbeer's business manager,
was not asked his opinion as to her
mental condition. George D. Gray,
the other executor, was not called on
to give his opinion. Mrs. Douglas
Sloane Watson was not summoned to
testify,, and lastly Miss Warren re
mained silent. These were the per
sons above all who could tell of the
real Bertha Dolbeer. Their failure to
enlighten the jury, he argued, weak
ened the cause' of the proponents.
"THE BEACON MGHTS.
The two beacon lights for the con
testant, as Johnson described them,
were the insanity of Miss Dolbeer's
mother and the suicide of the testa
trix herself. With these* points in
view, the glimpse into the life of tl^
young woman, he contended, would
clearly demonstrate that she was of
unsound mind when she executed her
will on April 23" of the present year.
According to the attorney there could
be no question that Miss Dolbeer flung
herself from the window into the air
shaft of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in
New York, and that she was Insane
at the time. Whatever doubt had
been entertained on this point, he
said, was dispelled by the deposition
of Alfred Armand, who declares that
he saw her gather up her skirts and
jump.
On the" opening of court in the
morning this belated deposition was
produced by the contestant, it having
Just arrived from New York. Its ad
mission was objected to on the ground
that the other side did not receive suf
ficient notice. During the preliminary
hearing on. this point Attorney E. S.
Pillsbury took the stand and inciden
tally declared that he believed Ar
mand's testimony was perjured, and
that It was procured by Charles J.
Stillwell, formerly a detective of this
city, but now in New York. Pillsbury
got as far as describing Stillwell as a
"scoundrel," when Judge Coffey
stopped further expression of opinion.
The deposition was admitted.
CLERGYMEN AND LAYMEN
GREET BISHOP HAMILTON
Prominent Divine Is Enthusiastically
Welcomed by Large Gathering at
Simpson Memorial Church. -
Bishop Hamilton received an en
thusiastic welcome at the Simpson
Memorial Church last night. The

of the congregation and clergymen
from other churches, all eager to see
and hear the distinguished divine.
After several eloquent speeches 'had
been heard C. B. Perkins yielded to
the unanimous demand and intro
duced Bishop Hamilton. The Bishop
said in part: .
Mr. Chairman, Editors and Brothers: I
am more than glad to be here. A man once
said. "There Is one place where I will not
be; made welcome â that la- at home." That
man has no sympathy from me. He Is like

yesterday afternoon from a bufiding at

slightly injured. The man's escape
from Instant death was remarkable.
- Moracci was standing on the win

balance and fell headlong to the stone
pavement below. During his down
ward flight, the window cleaner turned
a series of sommersaults and landed
on his hands and head. His left wrist
snapped like a breaking stick and a
severe gash was cut in his scalp.

picked up by pedestrians, who were
horrified at the sight of the accident.
Expecting to find the man dead they
rang for. the hospital ambulance.

James McConncll Attaches Strins to
Shotgun's Trigger in Vain En- r
:-T dcavor to End Life. â¢
James McConnell, 19 years old, liv
ing at 2910 Seventeenth street, shot
the left side of his face off last night
in a vain endeavor to end his exist
ence. The injured boy used a shotgun,
firing it with a string attached to the
trigger.
About 9 o'clock McConnell came
home and went to his room. He
loaded a shotgun, and after tying a
string to the trigger sat down on a
chair and pulled the string. His aim
was bad and to. this fact he owes the
life he evidently did not prize.
iThe sound of the shot brought the
young man's father to the room. An
ambulance was hurriedly " summoned
and McConnell taken to the City and

serious, are not necessarily fatal. The
