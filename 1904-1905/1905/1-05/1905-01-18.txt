House Committee Considers Bill for
Inquiry Into Charges Made
in Late Contest
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.âThe House
"Committee on Elections of President,
Vice President and Representatives in
Congress gave a hearing to-day on bills
introduced by Representative Bourke
â¢ Cockran of New York. One provides
for publicity of contributions to cam
paign funds in Presidential elections
and the other for the appointmerit of a
.special commission to inquire into and
ascertain the amounts of money ex
pended by both political parties in all
Presidential elections from 1892 to 1904.
In advocating the publicity measure,
Cockran said there was the spectacle in
the last campaign of both candidates
engaged in recrimination on this sub
ject.- He contended that it should be
known who contributed and how much
was contributed, saying that publicity
would leave no ground for, wrongful
charges. It has been charged, he said,
that the large majority given the suc
cessful candidate was due to the use of
monpy, but he said he did not believe
that to be true. He said that when it
could not be understood why some one
has been appointed Embassador or
..given a high position, he was subjected
to the charge that he "came up hand
somely." The Embassador to Rome,
for instance, was to be given a wider
â¢diplomatic field, and he had heard it
stated, although he did not believe It
to be true, that it was because he had
made a large contribution.

sion Whs not for the purpose of ex
posure, but to secure facts which would
be of value in framing remedial legis
lation. Cockran said the country had
heard of stupendous funds in 1896 and
1892. It was rumored, he added, that
$50,000,000 or $60,000,000 was used in one
'canvass, and it was well known that
the expense of printing and supplying
speakers was enormous.
Cockran did not object to contribu
tions.. He said he did not care if Rocke
feirer put up $2,000,000 or Morgan
$1,000,000, but he did want the fact
known, and objected to contributions
secretly made.
. Cockran advanced the argument that
' a great share of the expense of con
ventions should be thrown on the Gov
ernment.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 17.âWhile
clinging for life to a manzanita bush
on the verge of a 500 foot precipice to
which he had fallen, and kicking des
perately for a hold in the crumbling
rock, Daniel E. Gump discovered a
ledge of copper ore which experts pro
nounce a bonanza.
Gump, who lives in Lordsburg, had
conducted a hunting party to Browns
Flats in the mountains, twenty miles
north of here.
Alone he essayed a short cut on the
return trip to show his companions it
could be done.
Instead of emerging on the trail, and
meeting the party where he had ex
pected, Gump suddenly found himself
on a perilously steep mountain,side. A
bowlder turned under him and he slid
and rolled down thirty yards, landing
cut and bruised in the brush on the
edge of an abyss. He was within an
inch of death. His shouts attracted
the other hunters after a long time,
and it took them nearly a day to res
cue him from the fearful dilemma.
When finally taken down with ropes
Gump had samples of ore which local
assayers find runs $50 per ton copper,
JlO gold and $3 silver. The ledge from
which he took it at the risk of his life
â¢measured several yards on the surface,
and capitalists have taken hold to push
extensive development. The strike is in
the forest reserve at the head of Live
Oak Canyon, where scores of prospec
tors have labored.
NEW ENGINE
MAY CHANGE
RAILROADING
Successful Trial ol
Monkey Motion
Pattern.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OGDEN, Utah, Jan. 17.âA new type
of engine, known as the "monkey mo
tion" pattern, which, it is claimed, will
revolutiot.-ze steam locomotion on rail
roads, was successfully operated on
the Southern Pacific tracks to-day,
when a train of 1500 tons was run from
Ogden to Wadsworth, Nev., hauled by
one of the new engines.
The new type of engine was designed
by Edgar M. Luckett of the Southern
Pacific. Many advantages oyer the
standard type are claimed for the
"monkey motion." All the driving
mechanism is located on the sides of
the engine, making it easy of access.
The steam exhausts very rapidly and
there is no back pressure. â¢
It is estimated that the new engine
will save from 26 to 40 per cent in coal
consumption, being able to run fifty
four miles with one ton of coal, as
against twenty-five to twenty-eight
miles under the present system. The
standard engines now in use can be
changed to the "monkey motion" with
but very little cost.
Landslide in Norway Hits
Lake, Causing Wave Which
Drowns Fifty-Nine Persons
CHRISTIANIA, Norway, Jan. 17.â
Fifty-nine persons perished as the re
sult of an avalanche of rock at Naes
dal, north of Bergen, on Sunday.
A mass of rock was accidentally pre
cipitated into Loenvand Lake from the
neighboring hills, causing an immense
wave twenty feet high, which swept
the neighboring shores! Houses, peo
ple and cattle were swept away by the
rush of water, and it is known that
fifty-nine persons perished. Thus far
only four bodies have been recovered.
A great storm to-day stopped the re

Governor Sparks of Nevada
and Associates to Build
an Oasis in Death Valley
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 17.âOn his re
cent visit to this section Governor
John Sparks of Nevada arranged for
the purchase of one hundred opossums.
The animals are to be captured by H.
L. Price and Captain John Tinier, and
are to be shipped by express to Reno,
Net. Governor Sparks said that he
had also arranged for the purchase and
shipment to the same place of 100 Mis
souri opossums.
TheBe animals are to be placed in a
1000-acre park, which Governor Sparks
and a number of wealthy associates are
establishing in Death Valley. This
park is situated seventy-five miles
south of Ooldfleld. Governor Sparks
says that it is to be made one of the
most beautiful spots In the West. The
water from the springs is to be used
for irrigating the shrubbery and trees,
and the little oasis Is to be made a
thing of joy and beauty for those who
travel across the desert. Steps have
been taken, he said, to erect a hand- i
some clubhouse.
To Governor Sparks has been dele- |
gated the task of stocking the park,
with animals. He will place In it a
large number of antelope, deer, wild
turkeys, squirrels, opossums, raccoons I
and other animals. Various kinds of 1
fruit trees will also be planted around I
the springs.

tary von Rlchthofen has again con- â¢
veyed to the American Chamber of
Commerce intimation of the Govern
ment's unwillingness to recognize a
foreign institution in Berlin under
that name.
Secretary yon Richthofen says that
the Government has no objection
whatever to an association of Ameri

the objects for which the present
American Chamber of Commerce was
organized, but that chambers of com
merce in Germany are Government
institutions, chartered by the state,
and have certain defined Government
privileges, which cannot be conferred
upon a foreign institution under Ger
man jurisdiction.

LONDON, Jan. 17.â "t only remem
ber kissing my husband and feeling I
was getting colder and colder. Every
thing is blank to my memory until
I knew I was being carried down
stairs. Then I fainted again."
Thus spoke Mrs. Holden, a young
woman of Sapton, a village in the
county of Lancashire, to The Call cor
respondent to-day in explanation of the
extraordinary circumstances under
which she was brought back to life
while being measured for her coffin by
an undertaker. She looked very pale
and feeble, but spoke cheerfully.
"I have been subject to fainting,"
she added, "ever since I was born, and
this is the third time they have put
me by as dead. When I was fifteen
years old I was laid out for three
days."
The undertaker, through whose in
strumentality Mrs. Holden was re
stored to life, was accompanied by an
assistant when he called to measure
the body. It was a creepy story the
undertaker told of how he saw the
body laid out, rigid in the freezing at
mosphere of a disused upstairs room
and covered only by a sheet. He was
leaning over the pallid form to take
the measurements for the- coffin when
he was startled at observing a twitch- '
ing of the eyelids.
With an exclamation of surprise he
placed his hand over the woman's
heart, but all was still, not the slight
est pulsation being discernible. The
next instant the twitching was re
peated in an even more pronounced
fashion. The undertaker applied fric
tion to the inanimate body. Slowly
and with trembling uncertainty an
arm was raised, the glassy eyes quiv
ered in ghostly fashion, and a hand,
still deathly cold, clutched at his own.
The grief-stricken husband was
called, restoratives were administered
and the woman was carried down
stairs. Mrs. Holdon went into repeat
ed swoons, but they gradually lessened
in duration, and to-day she was able to
converse.

The theatrical trust had, this, supposed

will serve notice that, after she is through with Russia, she will drive
France out of Indo-Chlna in retaliation for her assistance to the Russians.
That Is the interpretation which will be put upon the note by this Gov

WOMAN SPY
IN SERVICE
OF RUSSIA
Czar's Minions Will
Be Stationed in
Los Angeles.
â¦â
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 17.âExamina
tion of a pretentious dwelling under
construction at the intersection of Jef
ferson street and Western avenue, in
the southwest section of this city, has
brought to light a Russian war plan
which is connected with the Czar's
Government by "underground wires"
running directly to Moscow.
The plan Is none less than the estab
lishment in Los Angeles of a Russian
spy station, to be in charge of Madame
Joroumsky, an employe of the Russian
Government, who for the last year has
been In the service of the Csar on the
Pacific Coast, spending her time alter
nately in San Francisco and Los An
geles. The woman Is now en route to
Russiaâpresumably to report in person
at Moscow. In her absence her hus
band is quietly directing the buHding
of the headquarters and its equipment.
The building is a ten-room structure.
The site is, isolated, shut In by a grove
of tall eucalyptus trees. An immense
cellar has been excavated, and a high
stockade fence is included in the plans.
Only Russian workmen recently
brought from the interior of that coun
try and unable to speak a word of
English, are employed. Of these there
are a score. Investigation shows that
the house is to be fitted up with a com
plete telegraphic system; the great cel
lar is designed for privacy in meetings.
The activity of the Japanese popula
tion of the Pacific Coast with relation
to matters affecting the present war is
said to be the incentive for the building
of this headquarters. Local Japanese
are aware of the plans of the Czar and
are watching the progress of thfTbuild
ing on Jefferson street.

Hay's Note Given
to Russian Em
bassador.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 17.âSecretary
Hay's reply to the Russian note al
leging violations of China's neutrality
was handed to Count Cassini, the Rus
sian Embassador, to-day. At the same
time copies of the note were dispatched
to all European powers which ap
proved of the agreement for the limi
tation of the zone of hostilities.
Wfiile the communication is couched
in the most polite language of diplo
macy, there is no mistaking it's mean
ing. It expresses confidence in the be
lief that the Chinese Government has
committed no breach of neutrality, but,
on the other hand, has exerted Itself
to maintain a strictly proper attitude,
and urges the Csar to adhere to the
agreement by which tne war zone was
limited.
Hay also addressed a note to China,
through the American legation in Pe
king, which has a double purpose. It
formally admonishes the Chinese Gov
ernment to maintain an attitude which
can give neither belligerent just ground
for complaint and follows this per
functory advice with an inquiry as to
the truth of the Russian charges that
China's neutrality has been violated.
This inquiry is made to give the Gov
ernment in Peking an opportunity to
reply to the Russian note. The Chinese
Government is afraid to answer direct
ly the Russian charges with a note to
St. Petersburg, but it is anxious to
strike at the Czar over Hay's should
ers, and Hay is quite willing that it
should.
Hay already knows that the Chinese
reply will be a vigorous denial of all
of the Russian charges. It will con
tend that in every possible way China
has preserved her own neutrality, but
will give dates and details of viola
tions of China's neutrality by Russia.
It will point out the dangers to the
peace of Europe which will result
from continued invasion of Chinese
territory by Russian troops.
Touching the charge that many Chi
nese are serving in the Japanese army
for pay, the Chinese Government, af
ter auestioning the truth of the alle
gation and pointing to the failure of
the Russians to find Chinese among
the Japanese killed In battle, will
raise the point that even If Chinese
did serve as Japanese soldiers, such
fact does not of itself constitute a vio
lation of international law respecting
neutrality. A neutral nation may
properly be required to prevent the
organization within its territory of hos
tile expeditions directed against a bel
ligerent, but It cannot prevent Its citi
zens individually casting their lot with
either one of the combatants.
The other charge in the Russian com
plaint, namely, the employment of
Japanese officers to drill Chinese troops
in modern tactics, will. It is believed,
be declared to be within the rights of
any power, and not a violation of the
rules of neutrality.
Hay will make China's reply public
and in this. way China will get her
side of the case before the world. It
will be Intimated that China's reply
is fully believed by this Government.
Russia to-day, through Count Cas
sini, expressed her thanks to the
American Government for Its prompt
action in calling China's attention to
the charges that her neutrality was be
ing violated.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 17. â The
Government of the United States has
not lodged a protest with Russia
against General Mlstchenko's opera
tions west of the Llao River, as cur
rently reported. The Foreign Office
points out that the sphere of hostili
ties, as specifically defined by Russia
at the opening of the war, extended
from the line of the Mongolian frontier
to the point where It intersected the
Liu River, a tributary of tbe Liao
River, along the Liao River and along
the Liu River to the point where it
crossed the Yinkow-Shanhalkwan rail
road, thence along the railroad to the
Liao River, thence to the left bank and
to the mouth only of the latter. A
small section of the right bank is be
yond the sphere, and there is no ques
tion of General Mistchenko having en
tered neutral territory.

Japanese Give Out Data Showing
. ': Conditions in Port Arthur.
â¢
.Tenacity of Defense Revealed
Â» .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
: PORT ARTHUR, Jan. 17.âOfficial
figures given out by the Japanese do
not bear out the statements cabled fb
â¢British newspapers by correspondents
. who are seeking to discredit General
.'Stoessel. It Is definitely announced j
that the entire Russian force in and
around Port Arthur was originally i
35,000 men. There were actually sur
rendered 9000 soldiers and sailors, of 1
whom a large proportion were unfit for
service. To the remainder fell the task
of garrisoning more than forty forts, |
large and small, against the attacks
of an army of 100,000 men. In the hos
pitals of Port Arthur the Japanese
found 16,000 sick or wounded men. j
During the siege 58 per cent of the |
officers were killed, and c.-ut of the en- |
tire number of officers only 28 went
through the siege unscathed.
The most surprising information
given out by the Japanese is that at the
battle of Nanshan Hill, the first great ,
combat on Liaotung Peninsula, the j
Russians numbered only 4000 men, i
and of these 2000 were killed or wound
.cd before the Japanese won the posi- I
tion. The Japanese losses in the bat
tic of Nanshan Hill were estimated at i
5000 men, and it was reported at the !
time that the Russian force numbered j
25,000. From the figures now given out
an idea of the unpreparedness <rf the
Russians at the outbreak of the war
may be gained.
The fortress here could have held out
for some time longer but for the fire
of the Japanese eleven-Inch howitzers,
which destroyed the food depots, the
workshops and the ammunition stores
and made the repair of the defensive
works impossible.
The latest news received by the gar
rison from General Kuropatkln was in
the middle of October, when he said
he had done his best to break through
the Japanese lines for the purpose of
â succoring Pert Arthur, but that he
had not been successful.
It is difficult to understand how the
Russian infantry remained in the
. trenches behind the Chinese wall, in
which great breaches were made. The
traverses and bombproofs of the bat
tery positions on Eboshiyama. in the
rear of East Rihlung Mountain fort,
fort "H," and the new Banjusan and
Wantai Hill positions in the rear of
. the Pahlung Mountain forts presented
an awful scene. Not a single gun
escaped being damaged by the Japan
â¢ ese bombardments. In the crest of the
ridge great holes were torn and the
gun emplacements were converted into
heaps of debris. Dozens of guns were
smashed and hurled from their car
riages down the obverse side of the
hill by the shell fire. Between Wantai
Hill and "H" fort a battery of ten-Inch
howitzers had been emplaced, and ev
ery one of these guns was damaged,
while some of them were totally de
stroyed.
One gun was evidently being loaded.
A shell was in the carrier ready to be
put to the breach when a Japanese
500-pound shell severed the carrier
chain and exploded. The entire gun
squad was killed by the explosion
and the gun was torn from its position,
while all around were the mangled re
mains of the gunners.
The effect of this last bombardment
of the siege must have utterly de
moralized the garrison, for the damage
done proves to have been much great
er than any one on the Japanese side
imagined at the time. The garrison
made its last attempt at resistance on
Christmas day against the Japanese
infantry, which by a spirited rush
. captured Wantai Hill. At 2 o'clock on
"the following morning the Russians ex
ploded mines under the battery posi
tions on the crest of the big East
Keekwan fort. These positions, which
were well constructed of concrete, are
now an awful wreck, strewn with
broken guns and debris of all kinds.
Not a vestige of the former works is
left, and the entire crest of the hill, one
of the most powerful battery positions
of the fortress, is a complete wreck.
STOESSEL LEAVES JAPAN.
Paroled Russian Officers Begin Their
Homeward Journey.
NAGASAKI, Jan. 17.âThe French
steamship Australien sailed to-night
with General and Madame Stoessel
and 565 Russians from Port Arthur,
including Admirals Gregorivitch and
Lcchinsky and Generals Gorbatowsky
Bnd Reiss and 245 other officers, some
of whom were accompanied by their
wives.
The Australien was not permitted
to leave port before darkness set in,
as a precaution against the Russians
obtaining knowledge of the defenses.
She was piloted out by Japanese naval
officers.
LONDON. Jan. 17.âThe correspond
ent of the express at Nagasaki had an
interesting interview with General
Stoessel, ln the course of which the
general said:
The capitulation occurring on New Tear's
day was merely a coincidence. The loss of
20.'!-Meter Hill and the subsequent capture of
forts, combined with the deadly marksmanship
with the terrible 11 -Inch shells, the depressing
efff-ct of the death of General Kondratenko and
the fearful increase of scurvy really fixed the
time of capitulation. It is quite untrue that
I dissented from the unanimous decision of the
ffnai. council of war.
As. regards parole, I dlsUnctly discouraged
any concerted action. Every officer decided
. for himself. Generally, commanding officers

houses, each two stories high. The
warehouses are 108x45 feet. John
O'Dale, vice president of the Weston
Bank, has built a tobacco warehouse.
The MeAdow brothers of latan have
built another warehouse. Doran raised
a good deal of tobacco last summer in
spite of unfavorable weather, and ri
cently sold his entire crop at 8 cents a
pound in the warehouse. Tobacco raised
near latan and Weston is said to be of
unusual quality. Next year many more
farmers will add- it to their crop.â

FIRM DENIAL
BY MITCHELL
On Floor of the Senate He
Answers Charges Brought
Against Him in Oregon
SCORES HIS ACCUSEBS
Makes Deep Impression on
Colleagues as He States
That He Is Without Guilt
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10.âThe unus
ual spectacle of a United States Senator
explaining on the floor of the chamber
charges made against himself by a
court of law in his own State was wit
nessed in the Senate to-day when
Mitchell of Oregon spoke of the* in
dictment recently returned against
him by an Oregon Grand Jury. The
Senator had not previously appeared
in, the Senate since the indictment was
returned and he was received by his
fellow Senators with many evidences
of good will. Jle was much affected,
his emotion at times being such that
he read his statement with great diffi
culty. In part, it was as follows:
I assert in the most positive and unqualified
manner that each and every one of these
charges, lit so far as they relate to or in
volve me, are absolutely, unqualifiedly and
atrociously false, and I here and now Indig
nantly and defiantly denounce authors
and each and every one of them, and brand
them publicly as malicious and atrocious liars.
. But I desire to be more specific, and there*
fore I further deny, in terms the most abso
lute and unqualified of which I am capable of
using, that I ever, either In the month of Jan
uary, 1902, In the State of Oregon or at any
other time or place, unlawfully or feloniously,
or otherwise, conspired with Blnger Herr
mann, then Commissioner of the Land Office,
and S. A. D. Puter. Horace H. O. McKinley,
D. W . Tarpley, Emma L. Watson, Salmon B.
Ormsby. Clark E. Loomis and William H. Da
vis, or with either or any of them, or with any
other person or persons, to defraud the United
States out of any part of its public lands lo
cated either in township 11 south, range 7
east, in the Bute of Oregon, or any other
public lands either in the State of Oregon or
elsewhere. Â«
1 /- rt i ier deny ln the mo>t absolute and un
qualified terms that 8. A. D. Puter did, either
in the city of Washington in March, 1902, or
at any other time or place, offer me, or pay
or Slve meânor did I on March 9. 1902, ln
Washington, D. C, or at any other time or
place, accept or receive from said 8. A. D.
Puter the sum of $2000 or any other amount
whatever as an Inducement to use my influ
ence with Blnger Herrmann, then Commis
sioner of the General Land Office.
Senator Mitchell then told in detail
how he had assisted Puter and Mrs.
Watson in Washington to secure the
early consideration of claims in
which they were interested. He con
tinued: j
r 1^.5*< ? l . not l he s "* h tÂ«et idea In doing what
7w w . . there Was anything wrong about
the entries or any of them. I did understand
that some one had made some objecjr.ns to
some of the entries at one time, months be
fore, but the same had been thoroughly ex
am ned and reported on favorably by the
register and receiver at Oregon City and by
two special agents in the field.
For what I did before the Land Office in
connection with these twelve entries, as I
heretofore stated, I was not offered, neither
* receive at any time, either two thous
and dollars, or any other amount of money,
or any other thing of value, from 8. A. 6.
Puter or any other person.
I further state that not unUl more than
two years after the consideration of these
cases In the Land Office, as above mentioned,
had I any knowledge or information to the
effect that there was any claim upon the part
of any agent of the Government or any one
Hse tbat any of these twelve homesteads ha"d
been acquired wrongfully and fraudulently.
Then the Senator attacked Francis
J. Heney, the United States Attorney
In the prosecution of the land fraud
casef, accusing him of unprofessional
conduct in the jury-room and assert
ing that subsequent to the convictions
in the land fraud cases early in De
cember and before sentence had been
imposed, Heney, "engaged with
United States District Attorney John
H. Hall in representing the Govern
ment in prosecution of said case, en
tered into an agreement with the said
S. A. D. Puter, Emma L. Watson and
others included in said conspiracy, by
which they were offered clemency or
leniency of some kind or character,
provided they would, by their evi
dence, involve myself, Mr. Hermann
and others in these frauds."
The Senator referred to his long ca
reer in the Senate and said that not
until this time had any charge ever
been made against his integrity, either
as a man, member of the bar or mem
ber of the Senate. It may be thought,
he said, by some that he had violated
precedent in coming to the Senate at
this time, but he declared. "I am an
innocent man and I have at this stage
of the proceedings the same right as
any other Senator to come here in de
fense of my character."
He trusted and believed, he said,
the time would come when he could
with propriety demand of the Senate
a thorough investigation of every one
of the charges against him. The Sen
ator said in conclusion:
I have been declared by unproven charges
to oÂ« unworthy to remain longer as your
associate, and being conscious of the absolute
reotitude of my actions and of my Innocence
of all wrong. I have deemed It not only my
right, but my duty to myself and to the
members of this Senate, that I should come
here and, thus publicly deny all charges which
I know to be absolutely false, and also to ex
plain publicly the acts upon my part which I
admit and which are now invoked by the
prosecuting officer of the Government and by a
portion of the public press as badges "of
crime.

IMPEACHING WITNESSES.
Utah Citizens Accuse Smoot's Oppo
nents of Prevarication.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.âAttorneys
for Senator Smoot to-day put on the
stand witnesses to discredit the /testi
mony of the three witnesses for the
protestants who gave what they al
leged to be the oaths taken by Mor
mons who go through the temples and
take the endowment ceremony of the
Mormon church.
P. S. Fernstrom of Salt Lake, who
has been a Mormon for more than
thirty years, swore that August Lund
strom, a witness for the protestants,
â who gave what he alleged to be the
Endowment House ceremony, could
not be believed under oath. He said
Lundstrom turned against the church
because he was asked to pay money
he borrowed from his Bishop.
C. P. Anderson, an assistant editor
of a Swedish paper at Salt Lake, cor
roborated Fernstrom's testimony.
H. J. Hayward of Salt Lake, a con
tractor and builder, also testified that
Lundstrom could not be believed un
der oath.
Jens Christian Neilsen, a Danish
Mormon, testified that he was the hus
band of Mrs. Annie Elliott, who was
a witness for the protestants concern
ing the Endowment House ceremony.
She had testified that Nielsen died six
years ago.
William Langton of Salt Lake, a
Mormon, testified that J. H. Wallis
Sr., another witness who revealed
what he said was the Endowment
House ceremony, bore a bad general
reputation and could not be believed.
Witness admitted he had been a po
lygamist

FIND BODIES OF VICTIMS
AFTER LAPSE OF A WEEK
Two Elderly Women Accidentally Asphyxiated
For nearly a week two aged women
lay dead from gas asphyxiation in a
little cottage at 30 Lynch street. One
was Mrs. Mary Conway, mother or.
Frederick B. Conway, formerly clerk
in Judge Mogan's court, but now a
fugitive from justice. The other was
Mrs. J. D. McMurray, mother of
Policeman H. McMurray. The bodies
were discovered yesterday.
From ail indications death was ac
cidental. Mrs. McMurray visited Mrs.
Conway, who owns the house, intend
ing to stay during the absence of the
latter, who was to leave soon on a trip
to Arizona.
The two old ladies were seen by
some neighbors as they entered the
house on Wednesday night. Mrs. Con
way retired to her own room in front,
and her companion occupied a room in
the rear of the cottage. In extinguish
ing the gas the visitor evidently did
not thrn the cock far enough. The
gas fixtures were new and worked
rather stiffly.
Mrs. McMurray fell asleep, and the
room filled with gas. The poisonous
fumes rapidly permeated the entire
hcuse. Mrs. Conway was awakened
and evidently thought that the leak
was from the gas fixture in her own
room. She attempted to close the
stop cock but instead turned it on.
Then she staggered through the oth
er rooms, fumbling in the dark with
the gas jets in each. She realized that
one of the stop cocks was open and
was filling the place with gas. But be
wildered and unable to see she could
not discover which one.
OVERCOME BY THE FUMES.
As she reached about in the dark
the poisonous fumes gradually dead
ened her senses. She made one effort
to retrace her steps to her own room
where she must have heard the omin
ous hiss of escaping gas. Just as she
reached the door of her room she fell
and after a futile effort to rise lay still.
Every door and window in the house
was locked. The gas filled every nook
and corner of the rooms. The gasps of
the two old women grew fainter and
fainter, and soon the stillness of death
reigned in the little cottage.
Neighbors soon began to miss the fa
miliar figure of Mrs. Conway, but it
was whispered around that she had
left for Arizona to visit her sick daugh
ter. Mrs. McMurray was taking care
of the home, it was reported. But peo
ple notice that mail left at
the doorway of 30 Lynch street was not
being taken in. People In the neigh
borhood thought that there was some
thing wrong in the little cottage.
Mrs. J. Johnson, who lives in the
house adjoining, notified Mrs. Dwelle
a sister of Mrs. Conway, of the pecu
liar circumstances. George Dwelle, a
nephew of the old lady, immediately
went to the house. He knocked at the
door, but received no response.
He climbed to a window, and, peer
ing into his aunt's room, saw her lying
in the doorway. Dwelle notified the
North End Police Station, and Police
man O'Sulllvan hurried to the place.
He broke open a rear jdoor, but was
driven back by the rush* of gas. Five
jets were turned on.
MAKE GHASTLY DISCOVERY.
It was some time before the pair
could enter. They found Mrs. McMur
ray lying on a bed in the rear room,
and Mrs. Conway stretched across the
threshold of her room. Both had been
dead for nearly a week. The bodies
were removed to the Morgue.
Policeman McMurray was sent for
and identified one of the bodies as that
of his mother. Mrs, J. D. McMurray
was 67 years old. She had been living
at 227 Flood avenue.
Mrs. Conway was 68 years old. Her
son, Frederick H. Conway, jumped a
$500 bail bond several years ago, and
has not been heard from since. He was
implicated with Daniel Sullivan in the
forging of bail receipts. Sullivan is
now doing time at San Quentin.
Conway deserted his bondsmen just

WILL PROCEED
WITH CONTEST
Testimony to Be Taken at
Once .in Peabody Case in
Legislature of Colorado
DENVER, Jan. 17.âAt a joint ses
sion of the two houses of the Gen
eral Assembly this afternoon to take
action on the contest filed by James
H. Peabody for the office of Gov
ernor, the request of the attorneys for
Governor Adams for an extension un
til 2:30 o'clock on Saturday afternoon
of the time in which to submit an
answer made in the contest papers
was granted by a vote of 61 to 34.
By the same vote the Legislature
decided to proceed at once with the
taking of testimony in the contest.
On motion of Senator Parks a com
mittee of five was appointed by Lieu
tenant Governor McDonald, who pre
sided over the joint session, to draft
a set of rules and regulations which
shall govern the order of the contest.
The committee is composed of three
Republicans and two Democrats.
Attorney VValdron, appearing for
Governor Peabody, said he wished to
be understood as not opposing any
reasonable request by Governor
Adams. He argued, however, that the
pircumstances required no written
pleadings, and he was clearly of the
opinion that any extension of time
gained would result in delay and
prove fatal to the cause for which
the joint session had been called.
Both Governor Adams and his at
torneys protested vigorously against
immediate action by the Legislature,
asserting that the proceedings would
necessitate his presence and that of
his counsel and probably preclude a
proper and thorough investigation of
the charges filed against him and a
satisfactory answer thereto.

SWAYNE'S FATE IN DOUBT.
House Will Vote To-Day on Question
of Impeachment.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.âWith an
agreement to vote on the Swayne Im
peachment articles to-morrow at 3:3-0
o'clock, the debate to-day was carried
on at high pressure for more than five
hours. Grosvenor furnished the text
for a very vigorpus speech by Bourke
Cockran by the reading of a letter
from Judge Pardee of New Orleans,
declaring that politics was at the bot
tom of the impeachment proceedings.
The fact of a Judge transmitting such
a letter, Cockran declared dramatic
ally, was "a monstrous spectacle."
Grosvenor asserted that there was
no ground presented for impeachment
in the report of the committee. The
other defenders of the Florida Judge
during the day were Lacey of lowa,
Nevin of Ohio, Moon of Pennsylvania
and Crumpacker of Indiana.
Lamar of Florida closed the debate
for the day, reviewing the sentiment
of his State and the record of Judge
Swayne. He declared there was am
ple ground for impeachment.

FRIENDS OF UNIVERSITY
FARM BILL WIN VICTORY
Commlt/ee Reports Against Buifding
4 / . , â  *
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 17.âThe fight
against Lukens' bill to appropriate
$250,000 for the construction of an agri
cultural building for the College of
Agriculture at Berkeley began this
. afternoon in the Senate Committee on
Agriculture and Dairying and it looks
. now as though the measure would be
.defeated. The committee, which is
composed of Lynch, Rush, Muenter,
Greenweli, Rambo, McKee and Diggs,
stands in favor of Diggs' bill, appro
priating $250,000 for the purchase of
an agricultural farm of not less than
320 acres and is advancing on the
theory that it would be strange reason
ing that would put the college build
ing one place and have the farm in
another.
After considerable discussion the
. committee agreed to report favorably
â¢ on the Diggs bill and ask that it pass,
leaving the question of the building for
further consideration. It is the sense
of tbe committee that the entire col
lege of agriculture, building and all,
should be transferred to the site of the
ffrm it recommends should be pur
chased. It points to the fact that oth
er branches of the university are do
ing splendid work far removed from
Berkeley and holds that none requires
such removal from metropolitan sur
roundings more than the college of
agriculture. A warm debate on the
floor is anticipated when the recom
mendations of the committee are read
to Ihe Senate in general session.
Southern California has a scheme
afoot to get the $50,000 it wants for an
experimental station by cutting In on
the proposed-appropriation for an agri
cultural <"ollege or standing out against
that appropriation unless it is allowed
the sum it desires.

some officials posted in such nuftters is
that with necessary appropriations,
outside of regular expenses, it will
reach $1.60 or $1,065. There are extra
ordinary conditions that must be met
this year, it is claimed by some of the
legislators, that will preclude a very
low rate. While it is agreed that the
Governor will do his best to keep down
the rate, that his administration may
be known as one of wisdom and econ
omy, it is said that he must face the
issue and that when the needs of the
State become generally known there
will be none to complain against the
raise.
It Is pointed out that the preliminary
work of reclaiming the inundated lands
of the Sacramento and San Joaquin ba
sins will cost much money before
means can be devised to make the re
claimed lands pay for their own sal
vation; that San Quentin prison must
be practically rebuilt; that Folsom
prison must be walled; that at least
two of the State Normal Schools must
be rebuilt; that additions must be
made to the hospitals for the insane,
all of them being overcrowded; that
the Capitol building must be repaired
at much expense and that much public
work must be cared for by increased
appropriation.
The preliminary step in the proposed
reorganization of the State's taxation
system was taken up to-night at a
conference of the Legislative Commit
tee of the Senate and Assembly with
Governor Pardee. There was a full
attendance of the committees and af
ter a lengthy discussion it was decided
to appoint a subcommittee of seven,
including the chairman of the Revenue
and Taxation Committee?. whose duty
it shall be to draw up a proposed con
stitutional amendment embodying th_
proposed chanpes.
Governor Pardee, who made the prin
cipal addreps of thÂ° evening, urged Â«
complete revision of the tax law and
suggested the rubstitution of a partial
indirect tax whvh would permit the
cutting down of the State property tax
one half.
AGREES WITH BELSHAW.
Drainage Committee Favors Bill Con
cerning State Land Titles.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.âThe Sen
ate Committee on Drainage. Swamp
and Overflowed lands held a session
this afternoon. It agreed to report fa
vorably on Belshaw's bill for the ralief
of purchases of State lands by legal
izing applications heretofore made for
the purchase of such lands under the
erroneous belief that they were
swamp lands, when in fact they were
salt marsh and tide lands and vice
versa. Emmons, while joining in the
recommendation that the bill pass, re
served the right to protest against the
measure on the floor should It be
shown later that the bill would vali
date any titles that had been fraudu
lently procured.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1905.
PRIZE FIGHT BILL CAUSES A
LIVELY DISCUSSION.
Strict Investigation
of Fistic Game
Is Desired.
Special Dlsr.atch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 17.âAnother
assault on the treasury by would-be
junketers was met with a hall of
oratory and successfully repulsed ln
the Senate this morning. This second
effort was attempted after much more
careful preparation than marked the
one that met disaster yesterday, but
it fell the heavier because the more
heavily backed.
Considerable surprise was created
when, shortly after the Senate con
vened, Bauer of San Francisco intro
duced a resolution providing for a
junket of investigation to the south
ern institutions, the committee to be
composed of Coggins, McKee, Muen
ter, Haskins, Bunkers, French, Nelson,
Markey, Bauer, Welch, Irish, Selvage,
Wright and Sanford and an assistant
sergeant at arms, all of them northern
men. The word went around that this
committee was the result of a com
promise with the southerners by
which a committee composed of Ward,
Broughton, Carter, Pendleton, Em
mons, Lynch, Greenwell, Leeke, An
derson and Diggs, all southern men,
were to be given a trip to investigate
the northern institutions. It was a
good plan, it was thought, and would
insure the support of the north for
the scheme of the south and the sup
port of the south for the scheme of
the north. But the promoters of the
resolutions forgot that under the rules
it takes a two-thirds vote to authorize
a junketing tour and after securing
the promise of a majority to support
the measures they rested. This was
fatal to their cause.
MEASVRE IS OPPOSED.
The conclusion of the reading of
Bauer's resolution found Belshaw,
Shortridge, Leavitt, Selvage and An
derson, the two last named being
among those listed for the junket,
seeking recognition from the-President
to oppose the measure. They were each
given an opportunity in turn to voice
their views and all agreed that the
time has not yet arrived when junket
ing would be advisable and even when
it is advisable they agreed that the
committee as provided for was entire
ly too large and would practically strip
the Senate.
French sought to stop the debate by
moving the previous question, but he
was unsuccessful and the opponents of
Bauer's junketing question drove home
their points. It was then put to a
vote and secured the support of twen
ty-two. with thirteen against. Tfie
proponents of the measure looked over
joyed when the President pronounced
the resolution adopted, but their joy
was short lived. Simpson rose to a
point of order, however, and pointed
to the rule that called for a two-thirds
vote. President Anderson glanced at
the rule, said the point was well taken
and declared the resolution defeated.
JUNKETERS DEFEATED.
Bauer and his followers looked dum
founded and their confusion had not
left them when the resolution calling
for the committee to visit the north
ern institutions was put to a vote, with
the result that some of them voted
against the measure, defeating it by
even a greater number than that
against Bauer's resolution. Senator
Lynch, who voted against the last res
olution, when he intended to vote for
it, asked for a, reconsideration, but his
motion was quickly frowned down, and
the junketers were finally defeated.
Just what further action they will take
to carry through their plans Is a mat
ter of speculation.
A resolution calling for the appoint
ment of a special committee by the
chair to investigate conditions pre
vailing in Napa Hospital for the In
sane was next presented by Senator
Emmons and sent to committee. The
resolution follows:
Whereas, Recent occurrence* in the Napa In
sane Asylum have shown that a serious defect
exists In the manner of selecting custodians
of the insane; and whereas, the investigation
now going on In the courts will only serve to
determine the guilt or Innocence of the par
ties accused, and will not throw any light-upon
the manner of the selection of the guards thai
resulted In the accusation of the two now un
der investigation. Therefore be It
Resolved, That the Senate of the State of
California do investigate the said occurrence
by means of a special committee to be ap
pointed by the president of the Senate, and j
that s-aid Investigating committee be directed
to reaert to this Senate some plan that will
prevent the st-lectlon of such guards In the
luture to care for our Insane and helpless
wards.
It was again time for Bauer to seek
further favor at the hands of the Sen
ate, but he was again destined to dis
appointment. The papers, he said, had
been making considerable comment re
garding Senate bill 24, that has as its
object the doom of prize fighting in
California, and he wished to Investi
gate the claims of the newspapers,
which he said could be done by the
' adoption of the following resolution:

SENATE BILL NO. 24.
Before the resolution was taken up
for consideration the Senate asked for
the reading of the bill, which is as fol
lows: '
Section 412âA person who within this State
J engages In, instigates, aids and encourages or
1 does any act to further a contention, or light
' without weapons, between two or more persons

livers such a challenge or acceptance, or trains
or assists any person in training or preparing
for such a contention, exhibition or light, la
guilty of a misdemeanor; provided, however,
that sparring exhibitions with gloves of not
less than eight ounces each in weight may be
held by the Amateur Athletic Union of the
United States or any domestic Incorporated
amateur athletic association, under the sanc
tion and according to the rules of the Amateur
Athletic Union, when such exhibitions are be

continue for more than fifteen minutes and are
for medals or prises other man money, which
are permitted by the rules of the Amateur
Athletic Union.
Section 2âThis act shall take effect from
and after its passage.
As soon as Bauer's object became
manifest the fate of his resolution was
Claim Is Made That
Extra Session Is
Needed.
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.âTalk of an
extra session of the Legislature to!
pass the code revision bills is being 1
indulged in by some of the statesmen
here. The claim is made that there will
not be time at the present session to
attend to these bills. Already the State 1
has expended between $200,000 and $300,- j
000 in trying to have them adopted. The j
Supreme Court held that the action of j
the Legislature of four years ago m ,
adopting them as a whole was illegal, |
and that action was nullified. Two'
years ago their adoption singly was'
prevented by the Judiciary Committee, '
of which Grove L. Johnson was chair- j
man, and a constitutional amendment j
adopted at that session giving the i
Legislature power to adopt them as a
whole was defeated by the people.
There is nothing for the present Leg
islature to do if it wishes the tangle
cleared up, the dead matter eliminated
and the live bills got together in handy
form but to deal with each of them .
that has been changed even by the in- j
sertion of a comma, separately, and .
pass it in the same way an original bill !
is passed. There are about 250 of the
bills in which some slight changes,
some very trifling, have been made by
Code Commissioner Davis, who is at
work daily on the revision. Half of
them will be introduced in the Senate
and half in the House. About forty
of them have been introduced to date.
Opponents of an extra session claim
that all the bills can be disposed of at
three evening sessions.

FIGHT OVER JUDGES.
North and South Ready to Lock Horns
on Measures.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.âThe Los
Angeles bill by which three new
Superior Court Judges are to be added
to the bench of that county will not
have the easy sailing in the Assembly
that it had in the Senate. The San
Ftancisco delegation thinks that in
view of the fact that San Francisco
pays one-quarter of the taxes of the
entire State, its bill to increase the
salaries of the Superior Judges of San
Francisco County should become a
law and It will ask the Los Angeles
delegation to stand for that law in re
turn for aid for its measure.
If the Los Angeles bench is increased
to nine members, that county will re
ceive $27,000 a year for its judges,
while San Francisco will, under the
present law, get but $36,000. the State
paying half the salaries of Superior
Judges. The San Francisco delegation
dres not think the proportion will be
fair.

CONFIRMS APPOINTMENTS.
Republican Caucus Approves Selec
tions Made by Governor.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.âAfter all
the storm and argument,- the Repub
lican caucus met* this afternoon and
quietly confirmed the appointments
made by Governor Pardee during the
last two years. The action of the cau
cus at tne opening of the session in
grandiloquently declaring that here
after the Governor must submit his
list of appointments early that each
name might be thoroughly scrutin
ized foreboded trouble, but It has al!
passed over without a second ripple.
When informed of the action of the
caucus Governor Pardee smiled and
said:
"1 never had any objection to the
action of the caucus; in fact. It grat
ified me because if i have appointed
or ever appoint a man that is not fit
ted for office I want to know it, and
soon. However, I generally know the
men I appoint pretty well before I
name them for office."

sealed. Lukens, Ralston, Belshaw,
Pendleton and Wolfe immediately op
posed it on the ground that it would
only serve to fill the Senate chamber,
at public expense, with pugs of all
grades and trainers of all kinds that
would rnly be too willing to testify to
the gentle nature of pugilism. Wolfe
suggested that the Committee on Pub
lic Morals be authorized to go to San
Francisco to investigate on their own
account the questions relating to the
morality of the sport. Bauer saw that
he was again hopelessly outnumbered,
so he moved for the indefinite post
ponement of the resolution, and there
was no objection. A warm tight on
this bill is expected when it comes up
for final reading.
Several impotiant bills affecting th2
University of California were intro
auced to-day by Senator Lukens of
Alameda. One provides for the appro
priation of $250,000 for the construction
of an agricultural building at Berke
ley, the second for the appropriation cf
$a0.5 for the construction of a forestry
station at Santa Monica and others for
appropriations of $10,000 for a light and
power plant at the Lick Observatory,
$12,Ouo to carry on farmers' institutes
and other sums for the carrying on of
vitlcultural and other experiments.
The bills were referred to the Finance
Committee.
Among the bills introduced were the
following:
By Lukensâ Stipulating what personal prop
er, y may be mortgaged.
By LukensâAppropriating $10,000 for re
search In viticulture by the State University.
By LynchâAppropriating $1500 for the im

istrators and executors chargeable to a certain
extent against the trust estate.
By RuehâAppropriating $12,000 to be used

Needs of the State's
Prisons Subject
of Report.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.-r-In the
Assembly this morning the report of
the special hold-over Committee on
Prisons and Reforms, that consisted
of Prescott, McKenney and Dunbar,
the latter not now a member of the
Assembly, was taken up as the spe
cial order. In presenting a resolution
to adopt the report of the committee
McKenney said:
"This report was drawn up after a
visit by the committee to all the pris
ons, and we are indebted to every
country on the globe for information.
Secretary of State Hay of our own
country was especially obliging. We
have collected reports and other litera
ture on penal institutions and penal
work from all over the world. Some
of the signatures alone are valuable.
The material Itself is extremely so,
and it will make a nice collection for
the library." I
Four pages brought down several
big baskets of the reports and other
documents gathered by the committee
and they were passed over the desk to
Clerk Lloyd. On motion of Goodrich
they were ordered sent to the State
Printer, and the Librarian was in
structed to have them bound and add
ed to the department of criminology.
"The report filed by the hold-over
committee," said Speaker Prescott,
taking the iloor, "urges some radical
reforms and some complete changes
in our prison methods. It Is not the
Intention to commit this body in any
way as to the final disposition of
these bills through the adoption of
the report. It Is desired that the
committee adopt the resolution as an
indorsement of the work of the com
mittee up to this time, leaving the
bills to be discussed on their merits
and acted on as the Assembly deems
expedient. I wish to emphasize the
fact that we have presented here in
the documentary evidence we have
gathered suggestions from nearly
ever- State in the Union and nearly
every civilized country. Though we
have in California some of th% finest
penologists in the world, our prisons,
it is too bad to confess, are, because
of imperfect machinery, a disgrace to
the State."
REPORT IS ADOPTED.
The report was adopted and Mc-
Kenney introduced a resolution
granting permission to the present
Committee on Prisons and Reforms,
consisting of McKenney, Lynch, Olm
sted, Amerlge, Ells. Bliss. Boyle,
Becket and Wickersham, to visit the
State prisons and the reform schools
at Whittier and lone.
"Does the committee intend to pay
its own expenses?" asked Houser.
"It certainly does not," said Mc-
Kenney. ,
"That is a matter to be attended to
afterward," said Bliss.
Houser moved that the matter be
referred to the Committee on Contin
gent Expenses, but there was no sec
ond and the resolution was imme
diately adopted. It is the first resolu
tion of a junketing nature to be intro
duced In the lower house this session.
The imDetus given to prison reform
legislation by the report of the hold
over committee is not to be allowed to
weaken. While the House committee
on this branch of legislation was in
session yesterday, Governor Pardee
sent a message asking that a Joint
meeting of the Prison and Reform com
mittees of both houses, the State Board
of Charities arid Corrections, the
Board of Prison Directors and himself
be called. McKenney, Wickersham and
Olmsted were appointed a committee to
call on the Governor and arrange for
such a gathering.
A large public meeting to discuss the
recommendations made by the hold
over committee'and to go Into prison
and reformatory matters generally for
the benefit of the legislators will be
held in the Assembly chamber some
evening soon. The hold-over commit
tee has sent out invitations to various
State officials and many other prom
inent people throughout California to
attend. The date has not been fixed,
but the meeting will be held early in
the session.
s SEVERAL XEW ATTACHES.
Several more Assembly attaches are
provided for in a resolution adopted
this morning. Anthony of San Fran
cisco gave notice that he would move
to reconsider at the next session of the
House, as he was afraid the agreed
limit of patronage was being over
stepped. Espey said the resolution had
been introduced to provide for some
persons who had come here prepared
to work and had been promised places.
He said it would be the last of the sort.
A bill was Introduced by Busick
abolishing the office of State Highway
Commissioner and providing that his
duties be performed by the Commis
sioner of Works.
Perkins presented a measure for the
protection of livestock men. It pro
vides that the word "gross" be stricken
from the law providing that railroads
and other common carriers shall be re
sponsible for damage to livestock being
transported by them in case of. "gross
carelessness."
Other bills were Introduced as fol
lows: i
By StrohlâRelating to a closed reason
for fish.
By ClevelandâAppropriating $25.0C0 to be
uted by the State Board of "Trade in adver
tising California products.
By McGowanâEnabling County Recorders to

WILL MEASURE
MOUNT WHITNEY
Survey to Secure Accurate
Figures on Highest and
Lowest Points in Country
A NOVEL UNDERTAKING
From the Peak Party Will
Go to Death Valley, Where
Is the Greatest Depression
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.â R. A.
Farmer, of the United States Geolog
ical Survey, left this city last evening
upon mission that may establish, in ac
cordance with scientific requirements,
the exact height of Mount Whitney
and also the lowest point in the United
States. From a geographical stand
point, the proposed investigation is
important for the additional reason
that Mount Whitney is considered the
highest peak within the boundaries of
the country.
According to mercurial tests, which
arc deemed by Government employes
unsatisfactory and liable to error,
Mcunt Whitney is anywhere from
1.".,503 to 15,530 feet in height. Farmer,
who is to take charge of a corps of
Government employes at Mojave and
who will direct the running of a line
of level to Owens Lake, across the
Mojave desert, hopes to use the ac
quired information as a basis for a
calculation mathematically and scien
tifically correct.
The same investigation will show
the greatest natural depression in the
earth's crust. The surface of Death
Valley, popularly supposed to be the
lowest in the country, has been esti
mate* at from one to five hundred feet
below the level of the sea.
It is proposed by another survey to
run a precise level from Merced into
the Yosemite Valley via Merced Falls
and Coultervllle, branching off at
Kingsley Postpfflce. and following the
path proposed by the Yosemite Val
ley commission as a practical railroad
route into the valley.
RAILROAD IS BUSY.
Lobbyists Working for Bill Once Ve
toed by Governor.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.âJere Burke
and Walter Parker, political agents of
the Southern Pacific, are again busy in
Sacramento. Their time was well oc
cupied to-day ln the Senate and As
sembly lobbying on behalf of a bill pre
sented by Senator Pendleton, which the
existing railroads of California are anx
ious to have passed, the same measure
having been killed by the Governor's
veto two years ago. The bill aims to
amend section 1240 of tne Code of Civil
Procedure, the amendment being in
cluded in the following paragraph:
' All railroad crosslnge, when physically prac
ticable, shall be made either under or over
the existing railroad which it Is dtstred to
oro!"*, and If crossing In any case shall be
physically Impracticable, then the pronosM
level or grade crossing shall be protected by
the installation and maintenance of an auto
matic switch and signal service, with derailing
switches, to be Installed and thereafter to be
maintained at the expense of the owners of the
railroad desiring to make such crossing.
Jibw here is the point of the bill, as
mapped out by members of the Senate
that purpose vigorously opposing It:
The existing railroads of California
have a pretty thorougn understanding
among themselves as to policies of com
petition and rates, but no one can tell
.iust what the next road to get a foot
hold may do. So it Is just as well that
the future hold visions of the tremen
dous expense for the corporations yet
to come. And again the Southern Pa
cific and other roads were here first
and hence desire that they should not
be compelled to share the expense of
overhead and underground crossings in
the event such provision is made in any
future franchises to be granted.
It is pointed out that the proponents
of the measure can hardly ask for its
passage on the ground of safety, for it
malfi no provision for the correction
of the present flat crossings that check
the State from end to end.

doctor made a second examination and
again he whistled, this time much
longer and louder than when he dis

The second search revealed a pebble
three-eighths of an inch long and one
eighth of an Inch wide. According to
Bucher's best recollections the pebble
had been in his ear about twelve years.
The grain of wheat, the doctor says,
must have been in the ear about a

3NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
COLD OF SHENG FOR STUDENTS
Powerful Chinese Prince
Establishes Scholarship
Professor Fryer Believes Others Will Follow
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Jan. 17.
His Excellency Sheng, mightiest of
all the great men in China, has been
induced by Professor John Fryer, of
the department of Oriental languages
at the State University, to provide five
scholarships for Chinese students now
at" "the university.
The first installment of the funds has
been received by Professor Fryer, and
four of the five fortunate Chinese
students have been selected as bene
ficiaries of their distinguished country
man's liberality. The students chosen
are later to be supplied with employ
ment by Sheng, in China, and already
can dream dreams and see visions of
political place and preferment at the
hands of the powerful Sheng.
This is the first instance on record,
according to Professor Fryer, who is
an authority on Oriental affairs and
thoroughly versed in all the history of
the Orient's relations with the West,
that scholarships have been given by
a Chinese official to the students of
any American or European university.
. The act of the Chinese official is the
result of an interview had with Pro
fessor Fryer last June when he called
upon Sheng at the latter's home in
Shanghai. These students are here on
their own resources and have difficul
ty in paying their own way.
Sheng is head of the railway and
telegraph administrations in China as
as well as in control of nearly all the
other important organizations for the
introduction of western learning and
methods into China. He is at the head
of the liberal party, his position being
greater and his power more extensive
than any other man in the kingdom,
RUSSIA'S SOIL
LOSING VALUE
Professor Hilgard Is to
Make Study of the Fa
mous "Black Earth" Lands
Â«
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Jan. 17.
Professor E. W. Hilgard, dean of the
college of agriculture of the University
of California, and the college have been
signally honored by the imperial Rus
sian Government by being requested to
give study to the causes of decay in
the soil of the famous "black earth"
region in European Russia, accounted
as one of the greatest wheat producing
districts in the world.
Professor Hilgard has received sam
ples of the earth with a request to con
duct a thorough scientific investigation
and to furnish a report for the guid
ance of the Czar's representatives in
their effort to revive the soil that is
rapidly becoming non-productive. Ana
lytical experiments and study will be
commenced at once by Dr. Lough
ridge, chief expert on soils in the col
lege, under Professor Hilgard's direc
tion, and report will be furnished to the
Russian Government at an early date.
The district, comprising 300,000 square
miles, washed by the rivers Don,
Dnieper and Dniester, is wearing out.
There is a gradual decay that the au
thorities fear will, unless checked, end
disastrously. Conditions have caused
an exodus of farmers and unless rem
edies are applied the Government sees
only depopulation of a once prosperous
and important farming community. It
is to learn what can be done to save
the district that appeal has been made
to the Berkeley scientists, whose world
wide fame has won them this important

according to Professor Fryer.
Sheng listened to Professor Fryer
and agreed to give five scholarships of
500 taels, amounting to about 5350
each, to five students, to be selected
by Professor Fryer. Soon <after this
promise was made Sheng was taken
seriously ill and nothing further could
be done until his recovery a few weeks
ago. Professor Fryer said to-day:
I have chosen Pu Tens Ching, Xl Kin Sun,
Wong Pin and Chu Pao Fong as four of th<
boys to receive Sheng's scholarships. Th<
fifth one will be selected soon. Two of th<
students are freshmen and two are sophomores
They are worthy of assistance, as are all oi
the score of Chinese students at our university
They will be used by Sheng ln some of hli
great enterprises In China after their gradua
tion.
This act of Sheng* s Is merely the thin end
of the wedge, which I hope later "will pen
etrate Into the Chinese life and lead to othei
gifts by Chinese for similar purposes and tc
the Introduction of Calffornla trained men Intc
the Chinese empire. Sheng's act is signlflcani
because of his own commanding position and
the recognition it gives the University of Call
fornla. It foretells, I think, the great pan
this university Is destined to take in the up
lifting of that oldest and largest empire lr
the world.
Sheng I regard as the greatest man lr
China, without question. He Is greater that
was L.l Hung Chang, and is really a wonder
ful man. His title Is that of "protector v
the Prince," and in a large photograph 1
have he stands at the right hand of th<
Prince, who Is seated la the midst of a grout
of noted Chinese.
Sheng's power Is remarkable and his abllltj
marvelous. His ideas are modern and libera
and he is a force that tends to the building ur.
of the Chinese empire and its regeneration.
I tblnk be is about 50 years old. He object!
to having his photograph taken or shown and
I think there are none of him extant, excepl
this group picture I have. He regards the
giving of* these five scholarships as an ex
periment. If the men he thus benefits ar<
found capable and valuable doubtless th<
benefaction will be increased and also be ar
example to Sheng's compatriots, who are ol
his party.

USES HIS FIST
AT WRONG TIME
Angry Intruder Attempts to
Thrash *His Brother-in-
Law in a Lawyer's Office
ATTORNEY TAKES HAND
Scatters Belligerent Rela
tives of Client Who Seeks
Protection From His Wife
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 17.
In an attempt to force Max Gold
man, his brother-in-law, to make terms
in a pending divorce suit, Harry
Barasch, flanked by his mother, Mrs.
Minnie Barasch, and his sister, Mrs.
Pauline J. Goldman, attacked Goldman
ln the offices of his attorney, D. F,
McWade, in the Blake & Moffltt
building, this afternoon, attempted to
strike McWade, and was only pre
vented from continuing by
McWade's action in forcibly ejecting
the husky intruder from his offices.
The trouble, which was caused by
Barasch's untoward conduct, was the
sequel to a long standing contest that
has been waged in the courts of two
counties between Goldman and his
wife. Some time ago Goldman, a tailor,
employed by A. S. Cohn & Co., 1071
Broadway, was sued at Martinez by
Mrs. Goldman for a divorce on the
ground of cruelty. Attorney M.
Ralph Jones took charge of her case.
Goldman resisted the charges and filed
through Attorney McWade a cross
complaint against his wife. After a
preliminary contest, McWade had the
suit transferred to Alameda County,
where it awaits further action.
Matters did not move to the satis
faction of Mrs. Goldman and her rela
tives. To-day the wife with her moth
er and her brother appeared at Gold
man's place of employment. They
flaunted legal documents at him and
demanded he should sign them. The
tailor, who is no match physically for
his brother-in-law, scented trouble. He
refused to deal with his callers and
referred them to Attorney McWade.
The trio descended upon the lawyer, to
whom also repaired Goldman.
After* considerable wrangling Mc-
Wade informed the three that he
should continue to do business with
their attorney. Then, left alone for a
moment, with Goldman he advised his
client to pay no attention to demands
for alimony, settlement or anything
else connected with the case unless he
should first consult his attorney. In
the midst of the talk Barasch and
Mrs. Goldman returned. Words passed
among the husband, his wife and her
brother when suddenly Barasch opened
battle by smashing at Goldman. Mc-
Wade intervened and was rewarded
with a drive from Barasch's fist which
missed connections.
To end the scene' McWade, assert
ing his right to peace in his own of
fice, displayed sufficient force to scat
ter his objectionable callers, who
rushed out of the apartments vowing
vengeance.
The Barasches made for the Polic
Court, but were not granted warrants
They declared they had been driven

MOTHER TELLS
OF FATAL CALL
Describes Incidents Leading
to the Murder of Daughter
by Lemuel D. Campbell
BEARS HIM NO ILL WILL
Testifies to Admitting Her
Son-in-Law Into the House
and of Hearing Interview
Oakand Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 17.
Hannah Cutler, the aged mother of
Laura J. W. Campbell, who was shot
jto death by her husband, Lemuel D.
Campbell, at the paternal home at 1362
! Eleventh street, in November last, was
1 the first witness called by the prosecu-
I tion this afternoon. In a dramatic
I part of her testimony under cross-ex
! amination she swore with uplifted hand
j that she had no hard feeling against
, her former son-in-law and exclaimed,
I"I would not hurt him if I could."
Mrs. Cutler is bent with years and
wrinkled, but her mind is bright, and
she remembers clearly the incidents re
lating to the fatal call. She testified
that she let Campbell into the house,
and to his salutation, "Good evening,
mother," she answered "Good evening,
| Lem; come in." She saw her daughter
accompany him to the door and heard
her say, "Now, be a good boy and go
away and come some other time."
Then she heard the shot and her
daughter's scream.
Campbell, she says, had been at their
house about an hour and a half. He
was ugly from drinking and wanted
his wife to come back to him. They
talked together for a long time.
It was not until after noon that the
jury was completed. The jurors are:
Jacob B. Tallmah. Frederick G. Welp,
William Langstaff, Henry Menges, E.
L. Sargent, Theodore Swift, John Bar
net, David McCarrom. Benjamin
Wright, John Soule, J. R. Taylor and
William Carrish.
FRESHMEN HAVE
HONOR SOCIETY
OF THEIR OWN
BERKELEY. Jan. IT.âA new honor society
ha* been organized at the university, the fresh
man class having decided to emulate the upper
classmen, who long ago organized such so
cieties as the Golden Bar and Winged Helmet.
The new honor society was founded by fresh
men who are especially Interested ln Inor
ganic chemistry. A constitution has been
drawn up and officers have been elected as
follows: President, A. C. Meyer; vice presl
dent, A. C. North; secretary and treasurer,
E. O. Slater. Dr. Morgan and Professoi
Booth have been elected honorary members.
Professor Booth's aid having been extended In
the formation of the society. The organization
will be known as the "Inorganic Chemistry
Society." High scholarship in chemistry will
be the requisite fo membership.
The university has received a collection of
800 art pieces brought from the republic of
Colombia as the gift of Cornelius Rumsey
of Riverside. The collection has been In
stalled In the anthropological museum In the
Affiliated â¢ Colleges in San Francisco.
The number of "cinches" this year Is forty
less than last, only 204 students having been
"cinched" by Recorder Sutton, as against 244
last term. Several prominent men are said to
have fallen by the wayside In their examina
tions, among these, according to report, being
Claude Kern, last year on the varsity football
team, and R. Bliss, custodian of the Stanford
ax, and a prominent baseball player.
The registration figures thus far made up by
Recorder Sutton Indicate an Increase ln regis
tration over last term. There were nearly one
hundred more students enrolled on the first
day than at the same time in 1004. the total
being 2020 as against 1033 last year.
The try-outs for the Carnot debating team
were held to-night in Stiles Hall. Thirteen
men entered. The results will be announced
to-morrow. The Carnot debate will be held
with Stanford late in the spring. Seven of
the ten medals that have been awarded ln
these contests have come to California. Stan
ford this year has a slight advantage, as
Sheriffs, who was on last year's team at Stan
ford, Is there now. None of the thirteen men
who were tried out to-night have ever taken
part in an intercollegiate contest. The list
Includes E. C. Nathan, E. C. Baker, G. C.
Rmgolsky, G. B. Glllson. W. J. Musgrove. W.
E. Moroney, H. L. Hagan, W. 8. Robinson,
C It Smith, J. S. Joford, E. M. Pelxotto. N.
A. Eisner, M. E. Harrison. The last named
Is the only freshman among the contestants.
Professors Gayley, Flaherty, Richardson,
Overstreet. Mitchell and Yon Neumayer acted
as judges to choose three men for the team
and one for alternate.
The work'of reconstructing the south drive
on the campus has been In progress during the
Christmas vacation and Is now well under
way. It is to cost 110,000. The road extends
from the Dana street entrance ln front of
Stiles Hall to the chemistry building. The
roadbed Is to be macadamized. The gutters
adjoining are of stone and cement. The curb
Is of 6-lnch concrete and continuous with the
gutter. A cement sidewalk five feet broad
Is to be built next to the curb on the south
side of the road. This form of road will be
a model for all to be constructed
In the future on the campus.
JACOB RIIS LEAVES TOWN
FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Well Known Philanthropist Thanks
the People Who Made His Stay
Here Pleasant.
Jacob Rils, the well known lecturer
and philanthropist, left yesterday for
Southern, California. Before leaving
he gave out the following letter of ap
preciation:
To the Editor of The Callâl cannot leave
San Francisco without saying a word of
thanks, along with a hearty goodby, to its
people who hive welcomed me as. It seems to
rte, stranger was never welcomed before. To
the California Club, to the men and women of
the Commonwealth Club, and to the scores
Whose kindly courtesy will live long ln my
memory and makes it just a bit hard to go
away, my heartfelt thanks. No one knows
better than I how small Is the deserving that
has met with such a welcome, but on behalf
of the men and women m the East who are
lighting for better things for their poorer
brethren and whom in some measure here I
represent. I accept it all gladly and gratefully
as a token that we are brothers, one ln aim
and purpose and ln honest effort, and as an
earnest of the better day that is coming to
our cities and to our land as surely as we
keep up the fight and never let go. I have
seen enough here to know that the same shad
ows, the same jjroblems are dogging your steps
that have overtaken us In our swift growth
into metropolitan greatness, and I have found,
too, the same unconquerable forces for good
that are winning our fight and will win yours,
that in the end must eternally prevail as sure
as good is stronger than evil ln God's world.
All good luck to you and godspeed.
Gratefully yours,

READY TO TEST
STATE'S WHEAT
Professor Shaw Will Soon Begin
Important Experiments.
Machinery for Work Arrives From the East
BERKELEY, Jan. 17.âProfessor
G. W. Shaw of the agricultural de
partment of the State University re
turned to-day from Portland, Or., to
begin the task of analyzing wheat
grown ln California, to the end that
the amount of gluten it contains may ,
be shown and thereby the product of
the State be put in a class which as
yet it has not reached.
The machinery for ihese important
analyses has just arrived from, the
East, with the exception of a few
pieces of apparatus that are to come
from San Francisco. Professor Shaw
to-day attended to the task of put
ting this machinery in place, with the
assistance of skilled mechanics.
Bags of wheat now litter the floor
of the room occupied by Professor
Shaw, each labeled to show in which
part of California the grain was
grown. While in Oregon Professor
Shaw tested the wheat of that State,
making thorough examination of all
Its properties. The results will be me
bodied in bulletins to be issued later.
The wheat of the north, 'however, is
not superior to the California product,
according to Shaw.
The agricultural department of the
university has this work of experi
menting and analysis of wheat ln
charge, . with Professor Wickson su
perintending the investigation, Pro
fessor Shaw performing the practical
work of analysis. Thousands of dol
lars have been raised by the State
Board of Trade and other commercial
bodies to prosecute the work and the j
State Legislature is to be asked to ap- I
propriate $10,000 to carry it forward.
Professor Shaw to-day gave out the
following:
The more gluten there is ln wheat the
more valuable It is as a food. California
wheat Is said to be deficient in that property.
W> will analyze specimens from each part of
MORE BOUNTY FRAUDS
UNEARTHED IN UTAH
Scalps Sold Twice Through the Con
nivance of the County Officers
In the State.
OGDEN, Utah, Jan. 17. âFollowing
the revelations ln Salt Lake County
of scalp bounty frauds aggregating
nearly $17,000 came the announce
ment to-day that Weber County has
been defrauded of $14,000 within a
few months. The arrest of William
R. Swan, deputy county clerk, and
Arthur H. Conslik, son of a former
Chief of Police, was effected to-day.
They are charged with perjury and
conspiracy and obtaining money by
false pretenses.
As in Salt Lake, duplicate bounty
was collected by plugging the holes
punched in the scalps by the County
Clerk first paying the bounty.

the State and see which locality has the best
grain in the matter of gluten. The experiment
is expected to prove of great value to tne
wheat growing Industry and the State at large.
The process of determining how much gluten
there Is In wheat Is not very complicated. I
shall first apply what is called the gluten
ttst. I shall separate the gluten from the â 
starch ln the wheat and then analyse the
.gluten itself. To get the gluten separate the .
dough made from the wheat will be held j
under a stream of water until all the starch
grains have become separated from the "&â¢ u *
mass of gluten and are washed away. WM ,
the wash water no longer contains any sedi
ment of starch I shall know the gluten Is
not alloyed. The wet gluten will be weighed
and a second weighing will be done when it
has dridd so that comparisons may be made.
Thus we 'will find the power of the gluten to
hold water, an important point. .Then I shall
stretch the gluten Into threads, to determine
its strength and tenacity. The longer and
finer the threads the better the gluten. Gluten
is the quality ln wheat that makes possible
the expansion of the loaf when the dough is
put into the over. The raising power of the
loaf Is dependent on the expansion of the
gluten.
The gluten will then be put into a standard
cylinder, which has a tight-fitting piston rod,
and will be compressed under even pressure.
Then the gluten, with all the water squeezed
from it, will go into an electric oven and we .
will note the expansion that results as Indl- I
eating the quality. First-class gluten should |
contain 65 per cent of glladln and 35 per cent (
of glutenln. the former indicating its ex- 1
panaive power and the latter Its cohesive
qualities.
The color test, so called, Is used on sam
ples of flour In this way: Different grades of
flour are spread on plate glass and smoothed
with -a steel spatula. Colored glass slabs are
used of varying color from light to gray to
brown. The flours are matched with glasses
and the color of the glass Is recorded which
corresponds with the color of the flour.
An interesting feature of the ex
periments Just begun by Professor
Shaw, following the analyses he will
make, is the cross-polinating of
wheats that are found to be superior
in glutenous qualities. The wheats
found to be strongest and finest will
be crossed to produce such effects as
plant and animal breeders accomplish
in their crossing of breeds.
PRESENCE OF JAPANESE
A BAR TO INSURANCE
Companies Think Growing Hostility
to Brown Labor Entails Too
Great a Risk.
SEATTLE, January 17.âWithin the
past few days several local fire insur
ance agents have received instructions
not to write policies upon sawmills or
shingle mills with which Japanese
are in any way identified, either , as
employes ln any capacity or as
owners. Â«
Underwriters dd not precisely agree
as to the reason. It is agreed, how
ever, that the most important factor
is a growipg hostility to Japanese
labor on the part of white laborers,
which is thought to be liable to result
at any time in 1 physical violence, with
consequent danger to property
through open trouble or incendiarism.

FOR MISSING DAUGHTER
They Do Not Share Mother's Fears
Mrs. Benjamin Borren of 211 Web
. 'ster street reported to the police yes
terday that her daughter, Eva Vand
ruff, 17 years of age, had mysteriously
disappeared, not having been seen since
: .she left home Sunday evening at 6:30
â¢ â 'clock. The girl went away in the
company of Mrs. Isla Murat. Edwin
Miller and Arthur Curran and no trace
has yet been found of any of them.
The mother was heartbroken and in
gr-f>at mental anguish, caused by the
fear that her daughter had met with
foul play. She said that Mrs. Murat,
whose husband is a photographer at j
Â£299 Mission street, and who is only 16
â¢years of age, came to her home on New I
Year's day, asking if she might stay j
there, inasmuch as her husband had I
dFiven her from home. She exhibited j
a note purporting to have been written 1
by her husband and demanding that j
leave him. It transpires that the j
Jl; was written by Mrs. Murat her- j
-elf and was used as a ruse to work j
an the sympathy of Mrs. Borren.
Mrs. Murat invited the two young j
men. who are each about 23 years old, j
.to call at the house and she introduced ,
them to pretty Eva Vandruff. One j
evening last week Miller took the girl ]
to his home at 4024 Eighteenth street |
.and introduced her to his mother. Eva
was engaged to a young man named
William Freshman, but Mrs. Miller
says that the girl appeared to be very
fond of her son and he of her.
â Last Sunday afternoon Miller and
-.Curran called on the younfe women and
remained till 6:30 o'clock. At that time
Eva- told her mother that the four of
'them were going out to dinner and |
that she would be back by 9 o'clock, j
â  Sh" left without any preparation for a
stay of several days and the mother is
convinced that ill fate has befallen the
child.
The police believe, however, that all
<>f the quartet will make their appear
â  ance. Miller and Curran were seen on
.Market street yesterday. Curran has ;
no occupation and his widowed mother, !
\vho resides in the city, is said to be in I
almost indigent circumstances. Miller
has been employed in a jewelry agency
conducted by his mother on Post street, j
PITTING IT STRONG.
But Doesn't It Look Reasonable?
This may read as though we were
putting it a little strong, because it is
â¢ generally thought by the majority of
people that Dyspepsia in its chronic
form is incurably or practically so.
But we have long since shown that
Dyspepsia is curable, nor is it such
a. difficult matter as at first appears.
The trouble with Dyspeptics is that
they are constantly dieting, starving
themselves or going to the opposite
extreme or else deluging the already i
overburdened stomach with "bitters," J
"after dinner pills," etc., which in- I
variably increase the difficulty, even j
if in some cases they do give a slight
temporary relief. Such treatment of
the stomach simply makes matters
worse. What the stomach wants is a
rest. Now how can the 'stomach be-'
come rested, recuperated and at the I
same time the body nourished and !
sustained ?
This is a great secret and this is
also the secret of the uniform success
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. This is |
a comparatively new remedy, but its j
success and popularity leave no doubt I
as to Its merit.
The Tablets will digest the food
anyway, regardless of condition of I
stomach. The sufferer from Dyspep- ]
sia. according to directions, is to eat
â an abundance of good, wholesome I
food and use the tablets before and |
after each meal, and the result will j
be that the food wHI be digested, no
matter how bad your Dyspepsia may
be, because, as before stated, the tab
lets will digest the food, even if the
stomach is wholly inactive. To illus
trate our meaning plainly, if you take
1800 grains of meat, eggs or ordinary
food and place it in a temperature of
98 degrees and put with it one of Stu- t
art's Dyspepsia Tablets it will digest
the meat or eggs almost as perfectly
as .If the meat was inclosed within the
stomach.
The stomach may be ever so weak,
yet these tablets will perform the
work of digestion and the body and
brain will be properly nourished and
at the same time a radical, lasting
cure of Dyspepsia will be made be
y- the much abused stomach will
be given, to some extent, a much
needed rest. Your druggist will tell
you that of all the many remedies ad
vertised to cure Dyspepsia none of
ihem has given so complete and gen
eral satisfaction as Stuart's Dyspep
sia Tablets, and not least in import
ance in these hard times is the fact
that they are also the cheapest and
rive the meat food for the least
none/,

Agrees to Reimburse Oberlin
students Who Suffered
Through Chadwick Affair
Â«
OBERLIN, Ohio, Jan. 17.âGratifying
j news was received by the students of
Oberlin College to-day, when President
King announced in chapel that all
moneys which had been lost by stu
dents through the failure of the Citi
zens' National Bank, which closed its
doors at the time of the alleged Chad
: wick forgeries, would be paid on pre
i sentation of passbooks.
President King announced, further,
that Andrew Carnegie was the man
who teas doing this. Carnegie, Presi
dent King stated, while innocently fig
uring in the bank failure, and in no
wise responsible, did not wish to see
deserving students and others suffer.
Besides reimbursing the depositors,
Carnegie reimburses the Young Men's
Christian Association to the extent of
some $3000, which had been laid aside
for a new building, and which was lost
in the same failure.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1905.
TURNS AGAINST
THE EPPINGERS
Warehouse Superintendent
Demings Says Firm Mixed
All Its Grades of Wheat
EVIDENCE IS IMPORTANT
May Mean Pro Rata Appor
tionment of the Entire
Sum of Money at Stake
After several days of investigation i
j as to the handling of grain in the ware- |
â â  house of Eppinger & Co., at Crockett, ;
James Demings, the superintendent,
i too% the stand yesterday and testified
j that it would be almost an impossibil
! lty to separate the pile of grain,
i amounting to* 3500 tons, at present in
J the warehouse, into lots giving each of
j the creditors his full share. The banks
jof this city and throughout the State
\ hold warehouse receipts for lots of
i grain, but the testimony of Demings
| conclusively proved hat the
! paid no attention to the numbers on
; each lot, but mingled them and pre-
I sented the result as the numbers asKed
â i * or *
', Demings testified that when a ship
i came for grain he would telephone to j
j the Eppinger office in San Francisco,
j and received orders to deliver the
; wheat lying nearest to the berth of the
j vessel, irrespective of the lot number.
[In many cases this was done, and
; when, for instance, lot No. 720 was
! called for a portion of lot No. 706 would
jbe given, and the numbers would be
j changed, so as to give the impression
i that the right grain was being given
j out. This practice went on for some ,
| time until, in the witness' opinion, it |
j was impossible to Identify the sepa- j
; rate lots.
A memorandum book used by Dem-
I ings was the cause of much argument ;
! between Frank H. Powers and W. H. j
j Chickerlng as to its admission. The '
] book contained what purported to be j
a segregated list of each lot of grain, \
I and therefore supposed to be of use in j
i identification. It was shown, however, I
| that the book was compiled from the
| missing books of the firm, and it could
â¢ not be admitted. It was also brought
I out that a great deal of the wheat was
I mixed with barley, and that the iden- i
j tification of individual lots was impos- ;
: sible.
Jacob Eppinger was called to the
stand during the morning session, but
under instructions of his counsel, j
James H. Budd, he refused to answer
any question on the ground that it )
might tend to incriminate him.
GRAND JURY IS ACTIVE.
Again Indicts the Eppingers and Ac
â¢ cuscs Election Commissioners.
The Grand Jury returned a new ac
cusation against the members of the
Board of Election Commissioners yes
terday, praying that they be removed
from office. The charge is similar to
that filed by the former inquisitorial
body, only correcting the technical de
fect that caused Judge Lawlor to dis
miss the original accusation.
Messrs. Robert W. Roberts, James
A. Devoto, E. C. Leffingwell, Thomas
Maguire and A. W. Voorsanger. who
constitute the board, will be served
with notice to-day and given ten days
in which to answer. There was no es
caping of prosecution, for some time
ago the Merchants' Association an
nounced that it would prefer charges
against the Commissioners if the ma
chinery of the law usually set in
operation in such cases did not move.
The allegations of misfeasance are
not new, being those set forth in the
Lilienfeld jury's accusation and in
the charges under which the Mayor
is at present investigating the conduct
of the board. It Is charged that of
ficers for the Seventy-third and Eigh
tieth precincts were appointed for the
primary election held last AuguÃt who
were neither on the assessment roll
nor residents of those Drecincts, and
that three of them were at the time
holding salaried positions under the
municipal government. It was in
these two precincts that the frauds
were committed.
The Grand Jury also presented ad
ditional indictments yesterday against
Jacob Eppinger, Hermann Eppinger,
Josua Eppinger and James Demings
in connection with the grain frauds.
The accused were indicted several
days ago, but yesterday' s charges
were on new counts. The Grand Jury
is bent on having successful prosecu
tions made in the gigantic swindle by
means of bogus warehouse certificates.
Bernard Ettlinger, who was a member
of the firm of Eppinger & Co., is
said to have furnished the jurors with
much new incriminating evidence.
Demings was superintendent of the
warehouses at Crockett that were de
void of wheat, though banks were
lending the firm hundreds of thou
sands of dollars on certificates repre
sented to be issued there.
James Demings was arrested yester
day afternoon and released on $15,000
bonds furnished by his father and
Captain Erickson. Jacob and Her
mann Eppinger were arrested last night
and each released on $15,000 bonds fur
nished by a surety company.
At a late hour last night Josua
Eppinger had not been found.
WILL VISIT ALL THEATERS.
Works Commissioners Declare That
No Favoritism Will Be Shown.
The Grand Jury committee, accom
panied by City Architect Shea and
Chief Engineer Shaughnessy, will In
spect all the theaters to-day. The
Board of Works has declared that no
discrimination will be shown and that
any theater which does not comply
with the regulations will be closed.
Upon application of Attorney Henry
C. McPike for the Baldwin Theater,
and Julius Kahn for the Unique The
ater, Judge Seawell yesterday granted
a temporary order restraining Chief
Wittman and the Board of Public
Works from closing those places of
amusement under directions of the
Grand Jury. An order .to show cause
why the injunction should not be
made permanent was made returnable
next Friday morning. The Baldwin
management recites that the place has
just been remodeled to lit require
ments of the Board of Works and
that the closing would entail great
less. _

SUES FOR DAMAGES.âWoIf Baron, dealer
in ladles' cloaks, yesterday filed a suit for
$80,000 damages for injured business reputa
tion against H. L. Smith. Baron says he sold
a part of his stock on Market street to Smith,
giving htm permission to occupy the store for
a month to dispose of it. Ho removed the re
mainder of the stock to Geary street, but says
Smith maliciously advertised that he bad all
of the Baron goods, with a result of ruining
Baron's business.
ALCAZAR SHOW
VERY POPULAR
"The Girl and the Judge"
Gives Miss Woodson's
Powers Pleasing Scope
"LUCIA" AT THE TIVOLI
Tetrazzini's Great Soprano
Voice Proves .Worthy of
Donizetti's Haunting Music
Â«
The Alcazar saw l&3t night a tidy
: little persona! success for Elizabeth
! Woodson and a new Fitch play of
more than common charm in "The Girl
and the Judge." Miss Woodson, the
; â¢ Girl," substituted in the part for Miss
Lillian Lawrence, who was 111. On
Monday night Miss Woodson read the
lines: last night she gave a perform
ance of the part excellent in the cir
cumstances, and with hardly any as
sistance from the prompter. It is this
kind of thii>Â£ that proves Che actress*
mettle, and Miss Woodson showed her
self both accomplished and unusually
adaptable. The part, an Annie Russell
one, was one well fitted to Miss Wood
-1 son's personality, and she invested it
1 with an appealing girlish charm that
reminded strongly at times of Annie
Russell herself.
The story of "The Girl and the
Judge" is based upon a somewhat
deeper note of tragedy than Fitch
usually cares to touch. The mother of
"the girl" is a kleptomaniac, and the
little family, father, mother and daugh
, ter. have been driven from place to
place through the mother's unfortu
! nate tendency. The first act finds them
jin Judge Chartris' office, where the
[ father and mother have come to obtain
! a divorce. The father acknowledges
; his own drunkenness as a good and
sufficient reason, and the daughter is
i told to choose between her parents,
j She clings to the mother because of
j her weakness. But Judge Chartrisâa
â¢ quite Arcadian sort of personâfalls in
love with the daughter. His mother,
an amiable and impetuous dame, also
falls in love with her. In quite Area
; dian fashion she calls upon the stran-
J gers the following dayâand Mrs. Stan
i ton, overcome by her old mania, steals
| a breastpin from the lady. The follow
ing scene, a bedroqrn scene, at mid
night, played by the mother and
| daughter, the mother confessing her
! crime, is quite powerful. It lacked
) something of emotional stamina ln the
I acting, which in the eire umstances can
j readily be forgiven.
How everything comes out right in
the end, and its pleasant way there.
I may be seen at the Alcazar. One meets
!in the play amusing and well-drawn
J types, the character of a landlady,
, who has seen better days, and in con
i sequence considers herself privileged
I to impose worse ones upon the board
j ers, being among the best. A Jewish
! pawnbroking lady and her wise son
I also add to the joys of living.
The performance is an uncommonly
j good one taken throughout. John
: Craig is the Judge, and convincing in
I the forethought, incisive, manly fash
j ion that is familiar with him. Miss
j Adele Belgarde has a very grate
! ful part as the Judge's mother, and is
humorous, womanly and mannerly In
; the part. Miss Christie McLean as
i the girl's mother has also manner, and
! is quite clever in her portrayal of the
i ingrained weakness of the character.
Another capital performance is that
of Laura Adams as the landlady. It
could hardly be bettered. Julia Branc
againâit is distinctly place aux dames
in "The Girl and the Judge"âfurnishes
a very fpnny character bit as the
pawnbroker. Calvin Dlx as her son
is also comically realistic. Then Luke
Connesa as the Stanton papa is ac
ceptable, and John B. Maher brings a
red wig and a couple of excellently
spoken lines to the cast. "The Girl
and the Judge" has "made good."
To-night Miss Lawrence will assume
the girl's part. The matinee of
1 "Ghosts." however, in which Miss Law
rence was to apDear to-morrow after
; noon as Mrs. Alving. with Harry Mes
i tayer in his well-known assumption of
i the Oswald part, has been postponed
until next Wednesday afternoon.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Â«
The Tivoli.
The audience that packed the Tiv
oli to its utmost limits went wild with
j enthusiasm* after the mad scene in
{ "Lucia" last evening and all on ac-
I count of the very remarkable vocal
; work of Signorina Tetrazzini. The dra-
I matic part of the scene did not count
i materially. In fart, it hardly figured
las an appreciable fact. But the sing
ing of Tetrazzini brought forth such
a demonstration of approval as will
be memorable in the annals of the
Tlvoli whenever they shall be writ
ten. It began with "bravos," deep
ened into American cheers and was
prolonged until the artist had been
before the curtain half a score of
times. The din sounded from the or
chestra chairs to the top gallery,
j which was densely packed with an
i audience of Italian temperament. No
I greater compliment has ever been
j paid to a singer in San Francisco.
Never was a demonstration more de
served. All this was in despite of the
fact tha/t Tetrazzin? had a cold. Her
art and purity of tone carried the day
completely, notwithstanding this
I drawback. It was a Tetrazzini night,
emphatically.
Slgnor Colli was the Edgardo. In
the last scene he secured "bravos"
and was at his best. La Puma was
the Enrico, De Marco the Arthur.
Oddly enough the sextet was given
only once and then wlth # flve instead
of six principal singers. The opera
was conducted Golischiani.
The chorus work was good. A fea
ture of the performance was the fine
harp playing of Signora Carusl.

Titles of Naval Staff Officers.
Civil Engineer Peter C. Asserson, U-.
S. N., was retired from active service
with the rank of rear admiral and the
corresponding pay, but when he used
the title of "rear admiral" upon his
visiting card a line officer of similar
grade protested to the Navy Depart
ment that Mr. Asserson, being a staff
officer, was unauthorized to use a title
that "belonged only to officers of the
navy empowered to actually command
ships and squadrons." The Secretary
of the Navy, by directing Mr. Asserson
not to use the title of rear admiral,
either in official or personal corre
spondence, practically supports the
contention of the line officer.
It is said that an effort is to be made
ln the next Congress to correct this an
omaly by authorizing the staff officer
to assume the corresponding line title.
Could not the' problem be solved by
some appropriate affix to the more fa
miliar and more generally honored title
âas engineer rear admiral, surgeon
rear admiral, pay rear admiral? There
is already a precedept for such action
in the case of the army, where we now
have surgeon general, paymaster gen
eral and quartermaster general. Some
such law authorizing the use on all oc
casions of a distinctive and sufficiently
honorable title would remove much
friction.â Engineering News.
Curse of the Permanent Job.
It is interestingâand possibly im
portantâto note that the chief cause
of matrimonial failures is the chief
cause of failure in other directions.
It is what may be called the curse of
the "permanent job." Give a man what
is, or seems to him to be, a permanent
Job, and he begins to go to seed. Am
bition dies, industry withers, skill dries

The tribunal which is dealing with

sinking of English fishing craft in the
North Sea has Just opened at the
French capital. Paris is resuming its
old glory as the world's polttical cen
ter. It was at Paris that the repre
sentatives of the United States and
Spain met to settle the issues growing
out of the war of 1898. It seemed Just
as appropriate a place for the United
States and Spain to meet in that Junc

Russia, Prussia, Austria. Turkey and
the rest of the European powers to deal
with the issues growipg out of the
Crimean war. It was at a congress at
Paris in 1783 that England recognised
United States independence. Twenty
years earlier a treaty of Paris brought
the seven years' war to an end. Be

(Gallop.
AW 31 EYEH IN FRONT
; Albemarle Causes Troublefor
'â¢ Stable by Poor Showing*.
Gateway Beats Judge,
â¢ Â«
In the hands of Hall & Marshall The
â¢ Reprobate is a vastly improved three
year-old, or else a most shrewdly man
aged one. Only last Saturday The
Reprobate won when played for a kill
ing, and some of the starters behind
him were visibly shy of speed, ln the
third event at Oakland yesterday The
. Reprobate was quietly tipped as a ripe,
; mellow one, and, piloted by Kunz,
- tame home on the bit, seven lengths
ahead of Lady Kent. In the ring the
winner's odds were hammered down
from fours to two, and in some books
â¢â¢ 8 to 5. Albemarle, considered the le
'gitlmate favorite, with McÃride in the
saddle, stumbled slightly at the start,
after which he ran a dull race. Meada,
a 25 to 1 chance, easily disposed of
'â¢ Mimo for the show.
FIVE FAVORITES SCORE.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
track was heavy, five favorites were
. returned first. A large crowd viewed
the racing.
Little Barrett, on Macene, a 12 to 1
â¢hot, from the Ezell stable, captured
the first event, a five and a half fur
long run. Barrett picked the inside po
. sltion in the stretch, Macene winning
ridden out from Pearl Waters, a 16 to 1
. shot. W. Davis managed to get cut off
on a couple of occasions with Mabel
Bates, the favorite, or the filly would
â  have won. As it was, she ran third,
beaten a head for the place.
After running third on three occa
sions, Abe Meyer, from Harry Stover's
barn, finally annexed a purse. The
.â Tyrant youngster had a pronounced
call in the betting on the two-year-old
â¢ scramble, and won off by himself.
Chief Wittman caught the tiring I'm
Joe, securing place honors by half a
â¢ length.
McÃride landed Dungannon, the fa
te-rite, first for the mile and fifty yards
: selling fixture, disposing of War Times
. tn. a nose finish. Anderson made all
â  the running with the latter and only
for McÃride picking the better going,
(he 6 to 1 chance would have scored.
W. -Daly on Barney Dreyfus was a
close third.
DR. SIIORB A WINNER.
.McÃride also had the mount on Dr.
Â£horb, a mild favorite for the mile
and a sixteenth event. Gin Spray
h eked best as the race was run, but
McÃride outgeneraled Chandler,
reaching home a length to the good.
J'akie Jones again finished third with
Theodora L. Mr. Dingle ran a fair
race after getting off poorly.
W, Davis broke it up badly on
Judge, equal favorite in the last race
at a mile with Gateway, or the black
horse would, have won. Davis' mount
"met with some interference at the
start, then he rushed him up on the
rail in the deep going and later, got
sharply cut off on the far turn by Rec
tor . and Arcade, the leaders. Once
â¢ again- about a furlong from the stand
judgp was cut off. At the wire Boyd
â¢ astride Gateway defeated him by
â¢something Qver a length. On the back
â stretch, the winner was pinched out
â¢of Jiis position. Boyd waited until
headed for the wire before making his
move. Arcade took the show.
TRACK NOTES.
McÃride piloted two winners, Dun
gannon and Dr. Shorb.
â¢ . L. -Struber, an Erie, Pa., millionaire
and a great admirer of the turf, was a
o'sitor at Oakland yesterday. Mr,
Struber Is interested financially in
many business ventures with E. E.
.Bmathers, the latter famous as the
:owner of many equine stars, McChes
-nÂ£y among others having carried his

BY LICK AT BASKET BALL
Large Crowd Witnesses the Game in
Gymnasium of the Young Men's
Hebrew Association.
The Lick team defeated the Corin
thians at basket ball last night in the
gymnasium of the Young Men's He
brew Association, 1970 Page street. A
large number of enthusiasts were
present and cheered for their favor
ite team. The flnal score was 11 to 5.
The Lick boys won by having more
experience and displaying superior
knowledge of the game. Several
times during the play the members of
the Corinthians fouled, thereby giv
ing their opponents a chance to score
try goals. Doane of the Licks played
well. He scored three try goals and
one field goal for his team. Bromley,
his team mate, succeeded in placing
the ball in the basket twice from dif
ferent positions.

game was done by Kamp of the Corin
thians. He scored field goals from a
long distance and won applause from
the spectators. A delegation of root
ers from the Lick School occupied one
side of the gymnasium and created
considerable noise with their school
yell.
The teams lined up as follows:
LickâDe Wolf, Bromley, Rodgers,
Stone, Strauss and Bowie. Corin
thians â Kamp, Welfleld, Lipman,
Spiro, Josef. Schoor and Jacobs,

FOR HIS FALL
Elmer Smith, Who Stole to
Buy Finery for the Ogden
Girls, Faces Prison Term
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS. Jan. 17.âElmer Smith's
invalid wife, who returned home only
a few weeks ago from the hospital,
suffered a relapse to-day upon learn
ing from the newspapers of her hus
band's thefts from the postofflce and
his attentions to Rita and Pauline Og
den of San Francisco. Her physician
to-night reported her condition as crit
ical.
Smith's bonds were fixed to-day at
$2600, which, he says, his family will
provide. The bond on the charge of
defrauding the Government is fixed at
$1000; the one for conspiracy is $1600.
His trial on the charge of defrauding
the Government is set for the May
term of the United States District
Court. His preliminary hearing on the
charge of conspiracy will take place on
Friday before a United States commis
sioner.
The Ogden girls, who have been re
leased, to-day left their flat by order
of the police. A sign "For rent" now
appears on the front door.
Smith does not appear to realize the
seriouÃ nature of his offense, and faces
the future as untroubled as a man go
ing to success. Instead of a probable
term in prison.
"It all began with the races," Smith
said to-day. "Last summer I went to
the race tracks, and the first thing I
did was to make a couple of hundred.
It came so easy I tried it again. I was
lucky for a while. I made a killing
of $1600 one day, and that night went
out to spend it. That was when I met
Rita. I lost as much as $1000 at a
clip. To make good again and get
another roll, I stole $1000 from the ex
press company. I had given Rita a
good deal of money, and when the ex
press shortage turned up she gave me
back $800, and I got $200 out of the
postofflce money orders and made It
good.
"I want to say right here that the
Ogden girls did not know how I was
getting the money. I told them I was
a plunger on the races and made my
money that way and had a good bank
account
"At first I believed I could make it
all back in a bunch and get out-even.
Then I met Rita, and didn't care, so
long as I could be with her."

Man Who Lost Fortune in
Wall Street Attempts to
Jump Off Brooklyn Bridge
NEW YORK, Jan. to
have lost his fortune of 180,000 as a
result of Thomas W. Lawson's attacks
upon Wall street Interests, Frank D.
Austin, 40 years old, twice to-day at
tempted to throw himÃelf from the
Brooklyn bridge. He was prevented
by Captain Devanny of the bridge
police, who grappled with him, and.
after a long struggle in which he was
helped by two detectives, placed him
under arrest.
Captain Devanny was warned that
the man was to make an attempt upon
his life by a pawnbroker whose place
of business is near the New York end
of the bridge. He told the captain that
the man had Just left his shop after
pawning some Jewelry, with the re
mark: "I guess the only thing left
for me is to Jump off the bridge."
With the two detectives the captain
found the man and rode closely behind
as he rode out on a trolley car on the
way across the bridge. The car had
Just passed the New York tower when
Austin sprang into the roadway that
separated him from the bridge railing.
The officers sprang after him and he
was subdued after a hard struggle.
He was put on another car, and sat
so quietly that the officers believed he
would make no more trouble. Sudden
ly, however, he Jumped from his seat
and was half way across the roadway
before the officers overtook him. Then
followed a most violent struggle, ln
which the three policemen were hardly
a match for him. Several women ln
the car were on the verge of panic
when Austin finally was subdued and
led back to the car.
"I wanted to end It all." he told his
captors on his way to the police sta
tion. "I have lost $80,000 in Wall
street, all on account of that frenzied
finance writer, Thomas W. Lawson."

COLLEGE OARSMEN TRAINING.
Bright Prospects for a Whining Crew
at Stanford University.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 17.
The boating season opened at Stan
ford this afternoon in the gymnasium,
where the candidates for the crew
were worked for an hour on the row
ing machines. Practice of this kind
will be gone through dally until Lagu
nltas Lake fills with water and regular
work In the barges can begin. A
dainty four-oared shell has been pur
chased in the East and the Stanford
crew will row this year's intercollegiate
boat race in the regulation weight boat
instead of the heavy barge used last
season. The Stanford crew was handi
capped hitherto because there was no
straightaway course on Lagunltas
Lake. When the race was run on the
rough water of the bay at Berkeley
the cardinal crew was so unused to
the course that it was never a con
tender for first place.
This year the Stanford crew will
have the advantage of practice on San
Francisco Bay. The City Council of
Redwood City has granted to Stanford
the privilege of erecting a temporary
boathouse on the city pier, which is ad
jacent to a course of deep water.
Of last year's varsity crew W. H.
Dole (captain), H. G. Butterneld. N. C.
Bryan and R. H. Gaither are back in
college and are again eligible. There
are also a large number of new men
who have had training and who will
try for positions in the shell. Profes
sor W. F. Durand, who was vitally in
terested in boating while at Cornell
University, will coach the men this sea
son.
BERKELEY, Jan. 17.âThe Univer
sity of California Boating Association
has been notified to remove its club
house on the Session basin, East Oak
land, by the new owners, the Oakland
Harbor Development Company, which
has purchased the lands from James
de Fremery. The association must sur
render possession within sixty days.
This order, also affects other boating
clubs on the basin. The property is to
be reclaimed for manufacturing pur
poses.

ANDREW CLUNIE QUESTIONS
EXECUTOR E. A. BRIDGFORD
Statute Quoted as Excuse for Employ
ing Additional Attorneys in
Estate Proceedings.
E. A. Bridgford, one of the execu
tors of the estate of the late Thomas
J. Clunle, who, with Burrell G. White,
has been accused by Andrew J. Clu
nle with the misad ministration
and misapplication of funds, was
subjected to a two hours' examin
ation in Judge Coffey's court yester
day in a further hearing of Clunie's
objections to their account.
Judge Bridgford said that he had
been a Superior Judge at Woodlands
for fourteen years and for seven years
had practiced law in this city. He had
been Thomas J. Clunie's law partner,
but the partnership had been severed
before the latter's death.
Questioned upon his allowance of
$10,000 attorneys' fees to Hudson
Grant and Walter Robinson, Bridg
ford said that he relied on the provi
sions of the statute permitting execu
tors to pay reasonable attorneys' fees
as his authority for making the pay
ment. He considered the services ren
dered worth the amount paid and said
that the necessity for further legal
service was occasioned by Clunie's
question of the validity of the trust
clause of the will and by Mrs. Clu
nie's contest On the point of another
of Clunie's objections he said that
Mrs. Clunle had been paid $104,000
cash and the remainder to make
$160,000 ln securities, and that Clunie
had advanced cash to guarantee the
securities. This was the reason it was
entered as a cash payment. The hear
ing will be resumed this morning.
YOUNG MONNIER'S HABITS
SUBJECT OF ARGUMENTS
Attorney Roche Concludes and Collins
Begins Presentation of the Case
to Jury.
Theodore J. Roche of counsel for
George Monnler Jr. concluded his
presentation of the case to the Jury
in Judge Graham's court yesterday,
and in the afternoon George D. Col
lins spoke for two hours in behalf of
the widow, Anna Monnier, who Is de
fending the winemaker's will. Collins
will resume this morning.
Young Monnier's habits and tenden
cies threaded both arguments. Roche
contended that the boy was not re
sponsible for his gambling and drink
ing proclivities, having been taught a
taste for liquor by his quondam
parents when lie was four years of
age, and having been Initiated by
them into the mysteries of poker when
yet a boy. Roche declared that Col
lins, as attorney, knew that Monnier's
will, when it was drawn, absolutely
precluded the boy from ever sharing
in the estate. He dwelt, too, upon the
elder Monnier's uncertainty before
making the will, as Indicated in the tes
timony of the friends whom he had
consulted.
Collins declared that young Monnier
was, a degenerate, and if the Jury
brcke the will it would give him a
fortune to spend and send him on his
downward course to ruin. The attor
ney had much to say about alleged
false theories advanced by the other
side, and said that the case was so
made because the fortune "looked
good" to the attorneys. He said the
charge of unsoundness of mind had
fallen and that of the widow's undue
Influence had not been proved.
Accuse Peterson of Murder.
The Coroner's inquest on the body
of William Nyberg, who was shot twice
and almost Instantly killed by William
Peterson, at 231 Third street Monday
resulted in the accusing of Peterson of
mu /der Peterson is a lo n&shoreman
and all the waterfront is being watch
ed by the police to prevent his leav
ing the city. Detectives Cody and
Fitzgerald are searching for the mur
derer He is about 27 years old,
five feet six Inches in height and haa

HAYES OFFERS NO EVIDENCE
IN SUIT OF CHARLES MAIN
Case of 'Aged litigants Is Submitted
on Plaintiff's Showing and Briefs
WiU Be Filed.
The trial of the suit of Charles
Main against Thomas R. Hayes, his
friend and confidential employe for*
fifty years, came to an unexpected and
unusual termination in Judge Sea
well's court yesterday morning. The
testimony of the aged plaintiff oc
cupied only a few moments, he tell
ing of the latitude he had allowed
Hayes ln the drawing of checks, mak
ing Investments and attending to
other business affairs. The defense de
cided to offer no evidence, but Instead
of moving for a nonsuit, which, if
granted, would not have barred Main
from beginning another action, the at
torneys for Hayes submitted their
case on the plaintiffs evidence. Five
days were given in which to prepare
briefs.
Main knew nothing of the issuance
of the stock as bonus for the Stan
dard Portland Cement shares bought
by Hayes for him except by hearsay.
The evidence of W. G. Henshaw. who
sold the bonds, and who Is now in En.
rope, was not produced, and the de
fense thinks that the proof has not
been made that Hayes received the
$45,000 worth of stock for his em
ployer.

' The Oceanic Steamship Company's

'r'iyed .early yesterday morning from
â¢â¢ :Honolu!u. She brought a large cargo

4000 bunches of bananas, 121 cases of
â¢:.Tpinea})ples, honey, ginger, coffee and
rice.
The- first three days out of Honolulu
â  -the Alameda was chased along by
."westerly gales. The wind blew with
terrific' velocity, but as the storm and
â¢the Alameda were traveling in the
''.same direction and as the Alameda is
*i famous seaboat, the anger of the ele
ments caused little discomfort to those
on board the liner and enabled her en

â¢reputation for faithful adherence to

â¢" The. fierce but friendly zephyrs
.which escorted the Alameda for a
thousand miles and made traveling
. easy for her were anything but friend
.ly to the Pacific Mail Company's liner
China, bound the other way. The
Ifn'ers met about 1 a. m. on Saturday.
The China was struggling along at
iquarter speed and shipping big seas
a.t frequent intervals. The China then
'Was six hours late. News of her ar

.was received yesterday by the Mer

â¢ The Alameda was five days and
twenty-three hours coming from Hono

FATHER GREY'S MENTAL
AND PHYSICAL CONDITION
Rev. Patrick Powers Relates Inci
dents Tending to Prove Old Man's
Susceptibility to Influence.
The mental and physical condition
of Father P. J. Grey during the pe
riod of his relations with Dr. Thomas
R. Brennan was inquired into at yes
terday's hearing of the venerable
priest's suit against his erstwhile com
panion and medical adviser for the
recovery of 237,000. The witness was
Father Patrick Powers, who has been
associated with Father Grey in busi
ness and private affairs. The purpose
of his examination by Attorney M. C,
Haseett, in the plaintiff's behalf, was
to show that Father Grey, by reason,
of his age and infirmities, was sus
ceptible to the influences which it is
charged Brennan exercised to induce
the priest to withdraw his money
from the Hibernia Bank. Father
Powers knew of their associations
from the time Brennan took Father
Gray to Paso Robles In 1899 and
throughout their residence in this and
Alameda counties.
Father Powers testified that in some
of the matters in which he was inter
ested with Father Gray the latter had
forgotten the details. On St. Patrick's
day, 1903, Father Powers found
Father Grey unconscious and sup
posed he would die. He was Indig
nant to learn that the priest had not
been spiritually cared for and pro
cured this attention. Father Grey,
however, recovered, and Father Pow
ers advised him to consult another
physician than Brennan, and the ad
vice was taken. Other instances along
this line were related, and the exami
nation of Father Powers will be re
sumed this morning.

GRANDMOTHER PETITIONS
FOR CUSTODY OF CHILDREN
Mrs. Ella Chamberlain Makes Claim
in the Matter of Butler
Smith Estate.
Some changes were made and some i
new points added yesterday in the
three-cornered fight over the guard- I
ianship of the prospectively wealthy ;
children of the late Butler Smith. The !
hearing was begun before Judge Ker
rigan. The petition of Mrs. M. Find
lay, nurse of the two-year-old Ran
dolph Smith, was withdrawn ln view
of the stronger claims of relatives and
in place thereof the petition of Mrs.
Ella Chamberlain, grandmother of the
infants, was offered.
The widow had the first inning.
She said his estate is worth about
$45,000 and that of his former wife
about $100,000. The daughter, Gene
vieve, and the boy, Randolph, are in
her custody. Two witnesses testified
to her fitness to care for the children.
The little girl, who has just passed
her thirteenth year, took the stand
and in bright but quaint manner told
the Judge that she wanted "her
mama," the stepmother, to be her
guardian.
Butler Smith's will, made before his
third marriage, was produced at the
request of Mrs. Chamberlain's attor
ney. He had left $5000 to the grand
mother and gave her the custsdy of
the persons of the children, placing
the guardianship of their estate with
his son, Hal V. Smith of Chicago. This
son is one of the four children of
Smith's first wife. After a quarrel
with Mrs. Chamberlain Smith wrote
a codicil cutting out her bequest and
giving Hal Smith the guardianship of
the children.
The hearing will be resumed, this j
morning.

Commissioner Heacock William
Brooks testified that the company 1
owned several small strips of land in
the Chinese Cemetesy in San Mateo
County. He said that the Crystal
Springs pipe line passed through the
cemetery and the company bought the
land for the purpose of preventing the
burial of any Chinese bodies suf- ,
flciently near to the pipe to cause {
pollution of the water.
Assistant City and County Attorney
John C. Partridge asked whether any
Chinese body was burled near enough
to the pipe to pollute the water, and
the witness replied in the negative. '

Many Important Questions
to Come Up Are Expected
to Be Well Discussed
â¢
Much praise is being extended to j
Rear Admiral B. A. McCalla by the
delegates of the Bricklayers' and Ma
son's convention for the hospitable
manner in which he received them
! when they visited Mare Island Mon
\ day. They were shown the interesting
sights about the island. Much inter
est was manifested in the Russian
j transport Lena and several torpedo
1 boats. The submarine boat Pike was
; cruising about with the crew on top
j and was the center of attraction. On
I leaving the island % Secretary William
j Dobson, in behalf of the delegates,
j made a short speech, in which he said
; the members greatly appreciated the
j kindness shown them by so distin
guished a man. As the steamer was
, leaving the delegates were saluted
; from the island. At yesterday's scs
i sion of the convention the secretary
' was instructed to thank Rear Admiral
j McCalla in a suitable way for the
courtesies shown to them.
j Saturday evening the delegates were
guests at a ball given by the Oakland
union. Each delegate was presented
with a handsome souvenir.
The general routine work consumed
the time yesterday. Invitations from
Delegate Edward Gerity of Los An
geles and Delegate William Thayer of
Los Angeles were extended to the
delegates to stop off on their way go
ing home and be the guests of the
J unions of each of these cities.
Delegates from Minneapolis are
! working to have the convention select
that city for the next meeting place.
Resolutions congratulating Governor
| Alva Adams of Colorado on his elec
tion were adopted. They will be sent to
the Governor. It is expected that reports
will be heard from some committees at
to-day'a session, and a lively time Is

THE CONVICTION OF WYMAN.
THE courageous fight made by Mr. Fairfax WheeJan and the
Merchants' Association against the ballot-box stutters has not
ended with the conviction of Wyman. There are others who
will in due time be attended to. These crimes were committed at the
primary election last August. It is conceded by all students of our
polity that the primary election, the beginning of the operations by
which the people declare their will, is of more importance than the
general or municipal election which follows the primary. It is
through the primary that nominations for office are made, and when
criminal manipulators of that first process combine they can, by
corrupting the ballot*box, nominate apparently rival tickets which
offer to decent citizens no choice at all. Whichever ticket prevails
under such circumstances the grafters and corruptionists, united by
articles of criminal partnership, have their way âdespoil the public
treasury and the private citizen âand there is no redress.
Because of the importance of the primary and -its direct rela
tion to good government all citizens are regularly exhorted to vote
thereat âto vote rightâto see that no one votes on another's name
and that the exact ballots cast are tallied and counted. The press
has heretofore done its duty, for the most part, in this exhortation,
but, sad to say, with little effect. The stuffers of the primary, em
boldened by the lack of watchfulness and able often to drive the
occasional decent citizen away from the polls by threat and insult,
have had their way, and it has been a foul way. Under these cir
cumstances there has developed a system of official winking at this
form of fraud. This was to have been expected. When it is possible
to corrupt the primary the official authority that generates in a cor
rupt ballot rises no higher than its source. It is created in the
crimes at which it winks and the criminals feel an immunity that
nerves them to further excesses.
At the August primary Mr. Fairfax Wheelan and a few other
citizens of courage and determination concluded that their duty at
the primary was more than perfunctory. They took it seriously and
seriously entered upon its discharge. They found this far from a
pleasant personal experience, for they were treated as interlopers
who interfered with what seemed to have become more than a pre
scriptive right to stuff ballot-boxes and falsify returns. In the face
Of much personal inconvenience and some personal danger Mr.
Wheelan stood his ground and secured the testimony which has
started one stuffer toward the penitentiary and has set other crimi
nals shaking in their shoes. The work of prosecution has only be
gun and it will be followed up with energy, discretion and all the
resources of the Merchants' Association.
But the work should not stop there. If the decency of the city,
represented by the Merchants' Association, can convict ballot-box
stuffers and protect the purity of the primary, it has upon it the duty
to go further and create a public administration no part of which, not
even the least, will be found winking at crime and encouraging crim
inals. This is the further and greater work that lies ahead. When
every public expression of official authority is in the spirit that has
been shown In the prosecution of the ballot frauds there will be no
such frauds to prosecute, for even criminals will not take risks ex
cept in the hope of gain, and from such an administration as may be
they cannot hope for any advantage.
The whole incident, from the day that Mr. Wheelan stood his
ground against difficulty to the verdict of the jury, is an enfranchise
ment of the decent, self-respecting citizens of San Francisco. It is
the first time in years that they have been made conscious of their
~ power. In this awakening their duty is revealed. It is that of constant
watchfulnessâthat eternal vigilance which is the price of good gov
ernment. It illuminates the pathway to this achievement, for there
is only one. If two be taken the result will not be reached. The
people who now, irrespective of their partisan affiliation, feel the
common inspiration of what has been accomplished must carry that
common inspiration forward in a common purpose in the .future. If
they go up one path together at its farther end lies good govern
ment. But if they divide and follow two paths they will exhaust them
selves uselessly. In that case the common inspiration will evaporate
and the last state of the city will be worse than the first.
Under the existing charter of this city there is less need for mere
partisan division than ever and greater need for a combination of the
virtue and civic pride .of all the people. Some of the depths which
reckless administration may sound are known by experience, and
this knowledge is a bugle call to such watchfulness as has been
shown in prosecuting the ballot-box stuffers. It also calls to a
further and higher duty, in which men must forget their general
political differences and divisions and stand together in a common
purpose, the highest that can inspire a good citizen to do his duty.
The Merchants' Association at its last annual banquet expressed
its high purpose in utterances that have drawn the attention of the
whole country. They raised great expectations far abroad. Let
these be realized, and let us have no lame and impotent conclusion of
purposes so worthy and so worthily expressed.
THE LIVE STOCK ASSOCIATION.
THE meeting of the National Live Stock Association in Denver
resulted in the disruption of that organization. The cattlemen
withdrew and have formed a separate cattlemen's association.
This is probably a wise movement. The issue in the association for
years has been the treatment of the grazing lands on the public do
main. The cattlemen have wished those ranges put under a leasehold
control, so that all land that is fit for grazing only can have its forage
protected, and not destroyed as it is by its use in common. But the
cattlemen have lacked coherence and unity of effort. They have
given a feeble support in Congress to the leasing policy, and the
sheepmen have given it a vigorous and intelligent opposition. The
result has been that the sheepmen have forced the cattlemen off the
range over a considerable part of the public domain. The cattle
men have made up for their lack of vigor before Congress by un
lawful reprisals on the range. They have tried to hold it against
the sheepmen with Winchesters and poison. In this range war there
has been considerable loss of life and a great loss of property, for
sheep have been killed and cattle have been starved by thousands.
If the cattlemen will now go by themselves, form their own asso
ciation and, refraining from violence, will plan a wise campaign be
fore â¢ Congress, the country will be'brought to see the wisdom of
preserving the grazing lands which can never be used for anything
else. When this campaign is wisely entered upon, it is within the
possibilities that a large percentage of the sheepmen will join in it
and we may have once more peace, prosperity and preservation on
the range.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1905.
GREER, DISCIPLINARIAN
ROXANA'S 'dog was an ill-condi
tioned brute. He was a surly
buU pup that had never met his
master, and delighted ln making
it most uncomfortable for those who
sought Roxana's company. He was
not often docile, even with her, but she
was so proud of his blue ribbon and
ugliness that she endeavored to hide
his delinquencies. Nevertheless, there
were times when she would not have
gone near him for the world.
One day he snarled at her before
Goddard Greer, and that was the be
ginning- of trouble. Greer was a col
lege-bred athlete, who feared nothing
on earth, except, perhaps, Roxana. En
raged, he seized thejuckless prize-win
ner by the collar and bore him to the
i hallway, where he administered a
j strong argument, after which he turned
the amazed animal loose down the
! back stairs. Goddard returned to the
parlor arranging his cuffs, but other
wise as usual. He stopped short as he
faced Roxana, who looked like an out
raged empress.
"A truly fine performance," she de
clared scathingly. "There is your ring!
I never wish to see you again!"
"What's upâl don't understand "
"If you think you can abuse my dog,
or any animal, and keep my regard
you are greatly in error. It is fortu-
I nate I discovered your true character
j before it was too late."
An amused twinkle lighted. Greer's
eyes. "Do you think if I let a dog snarl
j and snap at you, I'd be better fitted to
I take care of you? The beast has been
j hunting trouble. Come, don't let us
: quarrel "
"I shall never quarrel with you
j again," asserted Roxana sternly, as
I though depriving him of some pleasant
! pastime. "Can't you accept a hlntithat
! I wish to be alone?"
Greer stood his ground. He tried to
I laugh, but not very successfully.
"Come, Roxie, forgive me; you
i know the old proverb, 'A dog. a woman
! and a walunt tree. The more they be
beaten the better they be.' "
Roxana's eyes blazed, as though she
already felt the suggested chastise
! ment. "Oh, is that your theory? Well, I
j decline to be the woman!" And she
i left him to meditate on the ingratitude
!of womankind. They had quarreled
i before, but never with what appeared
jto be such finality. When Greer called
! again, Roxana was not at home. He
wrote, and his letter was returned un
opened. About a week later, Roxana,
having passed a day shopping and din
ing with her friend. Mrs. Vining, de
cided not to await Mr. Vining's delayed
return, though he had promised to es
cort her home.
"I'll jump on a car. I am not
afraid," she declared.
"But, dear, it's nearly ten. Phil
can't be long now," urged her hostess,
but Roxana was obdurate.
"Xo. I shall be all right."
I There seemed to be a delay on the
i line, for she had stood at the corner
i some minutes. Then a man joined
I her. Without looking, she knew it
i was Goddard Greer. She was in-
I censed. Had he followed her? Would
'he have the presumption to ride on
j the same car? As the headlight shot
| into sight, she decided to wait for an
i other car. rather than risk his unwel
i come proximity. Greer glanced in
: quiringly at her, but seeing that she
' made no move he likewise retained his
position on the curbing. 'Roxana tap
! ped her foot impatiently. It was ab
; surb! Why had he not taken his car?

hailed the motorman, mounted the
step and took her seat. From beneath
her lowered lids she saw Greer stand
ing sentinel on the platform. The car
was empty, with the exception of a
negro, and Roxana had traveled sev
eral blocks before the conductor came
to collect her fare.
She opened her purse and looked

j hurriedly from one compartment to
i another. It was empty! Evidently
she had spent every penny during the
1 shopping expedition. But there re
! mained her wrist bag, into which she
I frequently dropped small change. The
conductor went forward to speak to
the motorman. Roxana pursued the
search. In vain she emptied out her
belongings from the satchel. She found
no coin. Then she unfastened her
coat. Surely in the change pocket she
would fine a nickel. But the pocket
was as bare as Mother Hubbard's cup
board. The conductor returned. Rox
ana was frightened. It was late and
she ha,d quite a trip before her.
"I seem to have no change," she
commenced nervously.
"Allow me," Greer handed the fare
to the official, who looked question
ingly at Roxana.
"No! I'll get off! Please stop!"
DEAR YOUTH, a comrade wild as sweet thou art;
Thou lurest me to moods of glad excess.
When joys on joys so closely round me press
They almost crush my lightly beating heart.
Inspired by thee, my eager fancies start
To quickened life, and tempt me to digress
The old familiar paths, to seek the stress
Of ways untried, or else to freely dart
A course as careless as a wanton wind.
I love these moods that through my pulses fly,
I love their madness; on that day I find
Their dear delights have passed away, shall I
Lamentâor closer clasp what stays behind?
The joy that lives In thee can never die.

MONOCLES FOR WOMEN
THE LATEST FAD.
No loncer is the lorgnette the badge
of the New York grande dame. The
newest fad in this direction is the
monocle for women, says the World of
that city. Of course, the woman of
fashion could not risk her "make-up"
by sticking the glass in her eye. In
stead, she has the lens set in gold and
holds it to her eye. Mrs. Oliver H. P.
Belmont invariably uses a monocle at
the opef*a, and hers Is set in a gold
filigree frame. Poising the single glass,
she surveys the other women in the
parterre. Mrs. J. Fred, Tarns, famed
as the mother of the beautiful Violet
Cruger, also uses the monocle on all
occasions. The glass dangles from a
chain, set with pearls. Few of the
younger women have taken up the
monocle, because it implies impaired
eyesight. There is Mrs. Astor, for in
stance, who never uses any optical aid
in public except her opera glasses.
A TALE OF A TUB.
The two pretty American girls had
met two delightful Englishmen on
the way across and had given a cor
dial invitation, warmly seconded by
their mother, to Sir Charles and his
friend to visit them at their country
home. *
One day a message came saying the
two men would arrive that afternoon.
The family was thrown into a fever
of excitement, and many plans of en
tertainment for their guests were sug
gested and abandoned. It was finally
decided that as Englishmen are no
toriously fond of a "tub," and their
guest* were coming directly from the
train, they should first be invited to
take a bath. After that the hostess
would rely upon the inspiration of the
moment.
The young men arrived promptly
and after some demurring were hur
ried off to the bathroom. In about an
hour they emerged and went immedi
ately to their hostess, saying, "We are
sorry to leave so soon, but we only
came to make a call, and our train
leaves ln fifteen minutes." âMary C.
Frankfurter in January Lippincott's.
The Universal Trolley.
The bridging of gaps in the network
of trolley lines between New York and
Boston has gone on more rapidly than
was anticipated and now the last open
ing, that between New Haven and Wal
lingford, has been closed. As yet the
service is disconnected and except for
the leisurely inclined tourist too slow
for practical use, but there is no reason
why a through service could not be
maintained that would offer as many
inducements to travelers as the steam
road service. The Philadelphia-New
York network was completed last sum
mer. Slowly but surely the entire At
lantic seaboard is being bound together
by the universal trolley.
she decided promptly. Not for
worlds would she accept assistance
from Greer. She had dismissed him;
he had no right to intrude in any
way!
Heroically Roxana left the car, and
walked north. She had never been
alone on the street so late, and, re
membering the distance, the darkness
and the loneliness of the blocks, she
was really alarmed. She did not fear
the pedestrians she met as much as
those who overtook her. She dread
ed the sound of footsteps behind, con
juring up all sorts of horrors. As
shp hurried up the deserted thorough
fare, it seemed to her that some one
followed. If she hastened, the pur
suing footsteps quickened. When she
slackened speed, the other did the
same. It frightened her, and she be
came breathless. With the passing
minutes her terror gained. She be
gan to run. Then the dread became a
certainty. The other one would soon
overtake her. What if that negro had
seen her gold purse?
AC'S' the a*e ue she say, ar* alley.
She had neard thai thieves often
evaded arrest by disappearing in the
darkness of such places. If she cut
through might not she, too, escape?
Desperate, half hysterical, Roxana
made a sudden rush across the road,
a trolley grazed her shoulder, the
motorman cursed as he reversed the
lever. Terrified, she had all but
reached the desired shelter, when a
strong hand gasped her suddenly by
either arm. She tried* to scream, but no
sound came. Lifting her eyes her
glance met Greer's, looking sternly
at her.
"I guess that will do for one night,
he remarked coldly. "Come over to
the drug store, while I phone for a
cab."
Completely unnerved Roxana fol
lowed. The reaction had been sudden.
She tried to remember what they had
quarreled about, but couid only feel
relief in his presence. Greer ordered
the cab. then went outside to wait.
"Come," he commanded tersely on
its arrival.
Gratefully Roxana obeyed, then as
he was about to close the door, she
found her voice. "Don't leave me."
"I've no intention of doing so." And
he mounted by the -river. When they
reached her home, Roxana's eyes
were suspiciously red.
"Well." said Greer. The bull pup
sniffed respectfully at his boots. Greer
stooped and patted him on the head.
"The dog forgives meâ"
"Then its mistress can do no less,"
she admitted.
"'A dog, a woman and a walnut
tree â' " began Greer teasingly.
"Hush, hush!" whispered Roxana,
with her hand on his lips. "You know
I never really believed â"
"Of course not," he agreed prompt
ly. Then as his arms tightened about
her, "But, oh, Roxle. don't let us
play that game again."

TO YOUTH.
LEAP YEAR PROPOSAL
ON A TREE.
John Crouse. 5310 Heiskill street,
Germantown, is the recipient of a
strange leap year proposal, which ar
rived from Maine tied tightly to the
trunk of a huge Christmas tree, and if
the young woman in the land of
Christmas trees be in earnest the
strange communication will probably
culminate in a marriage, says a Phil
adelphia dispatch to the Chicago In
ter Ocean.
Crouse purchased the tree several
days ago, and, upon trimming the
branches, discovered a neatly folded
note tied fast to the trunk.
The envelope was addressed: "To
whoever may get this tree, with
wishes for a merry Christmas." The
letter was written In a flowing hand,
as follows:
"I am a young lady, 20 years old,
and am desirous of becoming the wife
of a good, loving man, who will pro
vide a home in some large city. I
cut this tree down myself, and with
every stroke of the ax I wished that
the tree might make a merry Christ
mas and bring a good husband to
me."
The name was signed and a post
office address of a small village in Pe
nobscot County was given. Crouse
immediately answered the note, ask
ing for further details of the young
womatffl matrimonial views and is
eagerly awaiting developments.
Editor The Call: It may be re
peated as a basis for a thought or
two upon the cause of earthquakes
that the foundations of the earth, con
sisting of the solid strata upon which
the surface rests, have evidently not
yet become permanently fixed. If
some of the temblors which have oc
curred recently at ' San Francisco
were caused by heavy blastings, and
others also recent seismic shakes,
why may not some of the quakes be
attributed to a settling and displace
ment of the underlying rock founda
tions by reason of the stupendous
weight of the millions of tons of ma
sonry piled up on the surface in the
massive buildings constructed of late
years on the northern portion of the
San Francisco peninsula? We may not
know what gravitation is. but weight
is clearly one of the causes of that

Ragan Proposes Law Prohib
iting- Purchase of Carbolic
Acid, Without Prescription
*
Health Officer D. F. Ragan yester
day decided to recommend to the
Board of Health that the Board of
Supervisors be petitioned to enact an
ordinance prohibiting the sale of car
bolic acid by druggists without a pres
cription. Dr. Ragan is desirous of re
ducing the fearful mortality from car
bolic acid taken with suicidal intent.
Dr. Ragan has ascertained that last
year there were forty-four cases of
carbolic acid poisoning treated at the
Central Emergency Hospital. Of these
sixteen died. Ragan has also discov
ered that many cases of carbolic acid
prisoning are not taken to the Emer
gency Hospital. Dr. Ragan is of the
opinion that a law requiring a physi
cian's prescription will lessen to a
great extent the mortality.
Another matter unon which Ragan
will file a report is the quality of the
gas furnished in this city. He asserts
that more, deaths result from asphyxia
tion in this city in proportion to the
population than any other city in the
wcrld and ascribes the cause to the
poisonous quality of the carbon monox
ide in the gas. In this category acci
dental deaths are also included.
Chemical tests will at once be made
to show the poisonous character of the
gas and publicity will be given to the
results of the analysis so the people
will be warnecKof the danger existing
therein.
DUNSMUIR CASE BEFORE
COMMISSIONER BENNETT
Friends of Legatee Visit Court, but
Testimony FnzzlesrThem and They
Depart Unenlightened.
The struggle for the Dunsmuir mil
lions is still occupying the attention of
Commissioner Bennett at the British
Consulate. Attorney J. J. Dwyer was
the only witness again at both sessions
yesterday.
He went on in the same line of tes- !
timony as on the two preceding days.
Yesterday was his third day as a wit- ;
ness.
Attorney S. Wheeler continued the
examination. -All his interrogations
were based on lines to prove what the
law Is in California in reference to the ,
execution of wills and the conclusive- \
ness of probate decrees.
Expert Dwyer has so far cited over
50 cases relating to probate procedure,
and he is not through yet. It had
been expected that Attorney Wheeler
would finish his examination of the
witness yesterday, but at 4:45 p. m. he '
was still going on with his questions,
so Consul Bennett adjourned the court
until this morning at 10:30. Immedi- '
ately following the direct examination !
to-day the attorneys for the plaintiff
will take up the cross examination.
Edna Wallace Hopper was not pres- j
ent at either of the sessions yester- i
day.
Late yesterday afternoon three men j
presented themselves at the Consulate
and said they had been friends of 1
James Dunsmuir and they wanted to
"hear the case." They were admitted, i
The small room was already filled with
those immediately Interested in the i
case, so the three visitors held up the !
side walls for a while. The method I
of procedure was evidently not what
they had expected. After listening to I
the citations of Expert Dwyer for a
ffcW minutes they turned to each other
and asked, "What's It all about any- j
way ?" As no light was thrown on the j
subject, they slowly filed out of court ,
and are probably still wondering.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1905.
GLAD TIDINGS
FAIL TO COME
Arthur Piper Waits Vainly
in the County Jail for
Order Setting Him Free
JUDGES DENY PETITION
Supreme Court Thinks That
Shipping Man Should Be
Confined Until He Pays
Arthur Leroy Piper must remain in
jail until lie decides to pay his wife
$150 on back alimony. The Supreme
Court has canvassed the circumstances
in the case and yesterday Piper's pe
tition for release on habeas corpus was
returned with "Writ denied" written
across the back of the document. The
attorneys for the prisoner were so con
fident they would secure their client's
release that they affixed an order for
the writ to issue leaving vacant the
places for the date and the signatures
of the Justices. The court's action in
dicates that the petition did not state
facts sufficient to warrant an investi
gation of the case.
While divorce proceedings were pend
ing Piper was directed to pay for his
wife's maintenance. Last June he was
shy $625 on his payments, but up to
January 6 he succeeded in getting con
tinuances. Then Judge Sloss ordered
him to separate himself from $150 or
go to Jail. Piper pleaded poverty, lack
of employment and general financial
debility, but to no avail, for Judge Sloss
issued an order for his commitment.
Deputy Sheriff McManus took Piper
into custody at the latter's home at
2921 Jackson street and removed him
to the County Jail.
The prisoner was not greatly affect
ed at the time as he thought his at
torneys could quickly make him free
again. Other Superior Judges were
asked to release Piper and then the
matter was taken to the Supreme
Court. Saturday afternoon the prison
er's lawyers attempted to persuade the
Justices to take action, but none of
them would consider the writ. Much
to the disappointment of Piper he was
forced to remain in Jail over Sunday.
As the case now stands, he must tar
ry behind the bars until he Is ready to
settle.
Petitions in Insolvency.
Martin H. Stephens, a carpenter re
siding in San Jose, filed a petition in
insolvency yesterday in the United
States District Court. Joined with

ities are $409 and they have no as
sets. The petition was rejected be
cause It was not drawn up in proper
form. E. W. Allen, retail grocer of
San Jose, filed a petition also. He
owes $12,427 and has $2050 assets.
His principal creditors are the Bank
of Campbell, $2600; M. F. Allen of

4 +
Daniel Donahoe, one of the most
popular citizens of Marysville, died
in that city yesterday after a short
illness. Marysville is in mourning
over the loss, for "Dan," as he was
generally called, has done much for
the city.
He was foremost in advocating im
provements, and his purse was always
open to the needy. In all public
affairs his opinion carried weight, and
his advice was sought on all matters
of public importance. He served as
Sheriff of Yuba County from 1896 to
1898.
Mr. Donahoe was born in Montreal,
Canada, on June 6, 1842. As a youth
he came to California and made his
home In Marysville, where he en
tered the employ of Hon. P. C, Slat
tery- In 1881 he founded the resort
known as the "Mint." The place is
known to thousands. Mr. Donahoe
leaves a widow and six children. The
deceased was the brother of Mrs.
Kate Hughes of Montreal.

in Sight of Her Husband. Who
Has Just Said Goodby.
Just after her husband had placed
her In a seat on a Kearny street car
at Market street yesterday afternoon,
Mrs. W. W. Savercool sank back sud
denly and died. Her husband was look
ing at her in bidding goodby as she
swooned apparently, and was quickly
at her side again. He gathered her
in his arms but she gasped in death
without a word to him. The body was
carried to a drug store, and a doctor
said either apoplexy or heart disease
was the cause. Mrs. Savercool was
50 years of age.
She and her husband had come re
cently to San Francisco to live, after
having lived in Plumas County many
years, where Savercool was engaged in
mining.
MRS. SELBY'S
FINAL DECREE
Wife of Minister Who Shot
at Judge Hebbard Comes
in Person to Ask Entry
DEPLOKES THE DEED
Says Husband Called Upon
Her on Day of Shooting
and Was Denied Admission
Theresa B. Selby yesterday severed
the last legal tie binding her to Isaac
Selby, the Australian minister, who is
now on trial for his attempt upon the
life of Superior Judge Hebbard. She
appeared personally in court and re
quested the entry of the final decree
of divorce in accordance with the in
terlocutory decree granted by Judge
Hebbard on January 15 last year. It
was the grievance Selby nursed over
this decree which Caused him to shoot
at the Judge. Mrs. Selby said to
Clerk J. J. Groom that she deplored
the trouble which had come to the
Judge through her case, and she also
said that on the morning of the shoot
ing Selby had come to her door and
knocked, but she refused to admit
him. She expressed the belief that
he might have killed her then.
Upon the evidence of Annie B. Hig
glns, corroborated in a circumstantial
way by bell and elevator boys em
ployed at the Hotel Inverness, Judge
Hebbard yesterday granted her a di
vorce from Dr. Theodore Shelton Hig
gins, dentist and former proprietor of
the hotel. Mrs. Higgins said that she
had gone to the country on a vacation
and, returning unexpectedly, found
articles of feminine apparel in her
husband's rooms, which did not be
long to her wardrobe. Mrs. Higgins
said that during her husband's attend
ance at the dental college she worked
ln a store in order to support him.
Judge Seawell granted a divorce to
Delia Stobener from John W. Stoben
er, superintendent of Cne Home of
Peace Cemetery, on a cross-complaint
charging crueky. Stobener first sued
and accused his wife of abusing him
self and the patrons of the burial
place. She denied the allegations and
said that he had mistreated her in
many Ways, including beatings, and at
last had deserted her. On the latter
pleading the divorce, was granted.
In the suit of Dr. G. K. Hubbell
against Harriet Hubbell for divorce,
the wife yesterday filed a sensational
answer. She denies his charges of
cruelty and says she never maintained
an espionage over his affairs. In her
own defense she says he was very at
tentive to Miss May F. Hallett, and
she believes that he promised to mar
ry her. The wife says that she assist
ed him in his practice and attended
to his correspondence. In the course
of this duty she opened several let
ters which she quotes in her answer.
One of them, signed "Nell," is full of
endearing terms and calls the doctor
"a fascinating, charming, bewitching
darling."
Dr. William M. McLaren, whose
wife, May E. â McLaren, accused him
of neglect and cruelties, including his
compelling her to walk eighty-six
blocks to. her home, yesterday filed
specific denials to alt of her accusa
tions.
Judge Kerrigan granted a divorce
to Eunice P. Cushman from Charles
Cushman for cruelty, with $30 a
month alimony and $1000 of com
munity property; to Margaret R. Gan
non from Joseph J. Gannon, cruelty;
Judge Hebbard to Kittle M. Clancy
from Robert K. Clancy, neglect;
Judge Murasky to James P. Daly from
Mary Ellen Daly, cruelty.

Selby Wants No Counsel.
Isaac Selby, who fired a shot at j
Judge Jr. C. a. Hebbard in his court- j
room on November 28, appeared in
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday for ' j
arraignment on a charge of assault

he had an attorney, and Selby replied
that he would plead his own cause. !
The court appointed Attorney W. Q. j
Deal to look after Selby's interest and
the defendant was arraigned. He will
be asked to plead on Friday.

PACKERS VOTE
TO SELL BONDS
'Authorize an Issue That
Amounts to $2,000,000
to 3leet New Conditions
ALSO INCREASE STOCK
â  S s
Add $2,500,000 to Total
Capitalization, Raising the
Figures to $7,500,000
The stockholders of the Alaska Pack
ers' Association voted yesterday to in
crease the capital stock of the corpo
ration from $5,000,000 to $7,500,000. An
issue of bonds amounting to $2,000,000
I was also authorized. At the close of
; the meeting it was announced that the
' bonds had all been sold and that more
i than $1,000,000 of the new stock had
I been subscribed for.
Henry F. Fortmann was elected
i president; D. Drysdale and A. B. Brad
j ford, vice presidents; C. W. Dorr, sec
retary and general counsel, and Isaao
I Llebes, treasurer. ' The following wars
[ elected directors: Henry F. Fortmann,
IW. B. Bradford, D. Drysdale, Isaao
Llebes. Francis Cutting, F. B. Ander
son, William H. Crocker, F. L. Lip
man. William L. Gerstle, Louis Sloss,
M. H. Hecht. An annual report was
filed by Secretary Dorr, in which ths)
general situation was described as fol
lows:
Ths year 1904 will long be remembered aa
the most trying and unremuneratlve season is
the history of the association. It opened with
large unsold stocks of canned salmon ln pack
ers' hands, of which the association held at
least Its full share. This came about as ths
culmination of a number of unfortunate cir
cumstances resulting ln thoroughly demoralis
ed and ur.responstve markets throughout ths
world. Among the chief causes which con
tributed to this unhappy situation may he
mentioned an unnatural and purely speculative
promoters' boom ln the salmon business; aa
enormous overproduction of canned salmon dur
ing the three precedlrg years, especially ln 1901,
when the coast output was abnormally In
creased from 3,000,000 cases to 5.000,000; and
the attitude of certain salmon packers whs
were either going through bankruptcy or foe
other causes became persistent price cutters.
By reason of an unprecedented ice Jam la
the Bering Sea the 1904 pack was made mors
costly than that of any previous year. Ths
burden of carrying previous packs into tha
year IPO4 end consequent reduction of values
has been enormous, but by no means disas
trous to the association. But for the fact that
very large sums had recently been expended
for betterments and improvements to the plants
and fleet, even this burden would have rested
lightly, but, coming as tt did at a most In
opportune time. It has produced serious hard
ships to those charged with the preservation
of the property of the association and ths
management of Its affairs.
It is, however, exceedingly gratifying to note
at this Juncture that the clouds seem to be
! rapidly breaking and ln due course of time
I the association may be expected to regain its
j old-time vigor and strength and resume Its
| commercial dignity and Importance as one of
the foremost industrial corporations of ths
j Pacific Coast.
Subsequent to the proceedings Presl
-1 dent Fortmann said that the bond ls
| sue, which will extend over a period of
j fifteen years, will furnish money to
j carry on the business that has been
] built up. Formerly the salmon was
â¢ sold as soon as it was packed to
some large dealer, who resold it to the
trade. The trade conditions have
changed. Jobbers at New Orleans or
other points do not desire to buy from
New York, but to deal with the pack
ers. Stocks have to be carried.
A large fleet of vessels has been cre
ated that has cost as much as one
! third of the old capitalization. The
; company decided that it was wiser to
i provide the proper amount of money to
| meet the new conditions and accord
\ ingly bonds were voted by the stock
holders. During the past year the gross
profit was $109,198. The reserve funds
j amount to $2,104,103. The association
I now owns eighty-one vessels. During
! the past year ten consecutive divl
! dends of $1 a share were paid, and two
monthly dividends of 75 cents a share,
aggregating $552,000.
Pilots' Demurrer Sustained.
Judge Graham yesterday sustained
the demurrer of F. W. Jordan and
twenty other bay pilots ln the case of
Catherine Brady, who sued for $50,009
damages for the death of her husband.
Thomas H. Brady, second engineer of
the steamer Rio de Janeiro, who was
drowned when the ship sunk off Fort
Point, February 22, 1901. The point
made in the demurrer was that a pilot
is a public officer, and that an asso
ciation of pilots could not perform tha
functions of the public officer. There
fore the defendants could not be held
liable for the faults of one of their
number.
HOLDS OUT ON POLICY.âBeIie Baahslde*
Bnquist yesterday sued the Mutual Reserve
Life Insurance Company for $1101 90 balance
alleged to be due on a $8000 policy taken out
by Frank J. Bachelder, deceased. She says
that when the company settled. It falsely rep
resented that It bad a Hen for ths amount
named on the policy and deducted It from ths
payment.

. New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 17.âThere were features
â .'.of strength in to-day's stock market, but they
â  â¢were varied by soft spots here and there. On
: the whole the market showed the effect of the
.large distribution of speculative holdings which
was effected on the opening bulge ot the week
â  yesterday. There was, decided shrinkage In
.the** volume of dealings along with the hesi
tating: and Irregular tone which was developed.
The seeming culmination of the rise in Union
Pacific wars a sentimental effect on the whole
list,, which showed clearly the want of the
stimulating Influence Which the strength of
"jhe" Stock has exercised for several days i :ist.
The serving of formal notice of the Intention
â¢of the'contesting interests to apply lor a writ
mY certiorari to review the opinion in favor of
i the. Northern Securities Company was under
.-. -stood to have the power of a stay on any
distribution of the cssbts of that company,
â  pending the final decision of the United States
;'. f'u'prenje Court. This served as a discourage
ment to the rum its, which have been lndus-
Yuiously' circulated. that a compromise, a
pVsmpt distribution of Northern Securities as
.si ts and the comprehensive readjustment of
railroad relation.-! on the whole trsns-contlnen
'tal field, would be announced at an early date.
.-Union Pacific rose steady over last night's level
. several times, but It was constantly affected
'â¢â¢by tfie feeling of the demand ln the efforts to
- u'alize. The weakness of Amalgamated Copper
i#lstr had a sentimental influence, the more so
- : a.; the price of the metal was further ad
vanced and reports continued persistent of an
-. intended Increase in the dividend rate. Div
idend Increases and prospects played a con
siderable part In .the day's market. The plac
' ing oi Chicago, St. Paul, Minnesota and
Umaba' oa a seven per cent dividend basis
â¢'iivused a rapid rise ot 19 points in that stock
. -Slid "removed the hopes of Increased dtsburse

*5i i;inir were manifestly affected by such
iUadlng was easily the center of In
st in the market and there was no specific
:..nÂ»wi to account for Its fresh advance. The
: j-ge amounts of this stock which have been
â  thkeh out of the market to envct the distribu
tion of its control among other railroads bss
'.'â¢ t the fUmiing supply so small thai it rV
?! -nds readily to operations designed to move
Uk? pclce. -For this reason It has become a
favorite with operators who desire to make an
" upon "speculativesentiment*. It proved
no meafcs +qual. however, to Union Pacific
. ai'an instrument for that purpose. The out
', side market held its recent large share of at
â¢ t.-ttfion'tordav. although activity shifted from
Northern Securities into International Mercan
tile Marine, which, together with Northern
'. â¢.Securities, was one of the late creations ln
'â¢â¢ the period of wholesale output of new securl
â¢ ties,- which ' was too late to get through its
preliminary stage in the outside market and
make'its entry on the Stock Exchange itself.
. A-violent break in the new United States Shlp-
Kuildtug stocks also brought into renewed notl^;
â an eld episode In the outside market. Nothing
: developed to explain either movement. Prices
â un the. Stock Exchange faded away ln the
latter part of the day and the closing was
wrak and generally slightly below last night s

Chicago Grain and Produce.
CHICAGO, Jan. 17.âThe wheat market had
a weak undertone throughout the entire ses
sion. Initial quotations on May were off %c
to %o%c at $1 15 to $1 15%0l 154. Scattered
selling by commission houses and pit traders
was the Immediate cause of the opening de
cline. "The chief factor responsible for the sell
ing pressure was a break of almost a penny
ln the price of wheat at Liverpool. The weak
ness of the English market was In turn said
to be due to cheaper Argentine offerings, In
dicating an increase In shipments from that
country. After the first rush of selling had
subsided the market here became somewhat
firmer. The faot that Northwest receipts etlll
continued to arrive ln decreased quantities had
a tendency to check the general desire to sell.
Total primary receipts also were much smaller
than for the corresponding day a year ago,
| and this had a slightly bullish effect. Follow
ing fair trading by the leader of the bulls,
pit traders made moderate purchases, result
ing ln May advancing to $1 154Â©i 16%. Weak
ness of cash wheat at all the principal cen
ters, however, had a depressing influence on
speculative trading, and the market soon
sagged off again. The close was easy, with
May at $1 15%.
The corn market was rather essy esrly in
the session, but buying by shorts resulted In
a firmer undertone during the latter part of
the session. May opened a shade to 4c lower
at 44% c to 44%Â©44% c, sold up to 46c. and
closed at 44%@44%c.
A decrease of half a million bushels In local
stocks for the week had a strengthening ef
fect on the oats market. May opened un
changed to 4c lower at 30%Â©31 c, sold un to
814 c and closed at 3140314 c.
Provisions were dull and a shade easier At
the close May pork was off 24c Lard and

â¢ STOCK MARKET.
A Heavy and Interesting Day on the
Bond Exchange.
Yesterday was a heavy and Interesting day
en the Stock and Bond Exchange, sales being
large and varied and fluctuations numerous.
The sugars continued to attract the most at
tention and were still higher, though ln the
alternoon some wavering appeared, giving
several a reacting aspect. Tbe high prices of
the day were: Hawaiian Commercial $83,
Puauhau $25 12H. Hutchinson $18 25, Honokaa
$22. Onomea $35 and Makawell $37. The close
In these stocks was easy.
After the sugar group Alaska Packers was
the next interesting stock, being Very sensitive
owing to the afternoon meeting of the stock
holders called to ratify the proposed plan of
reorganization already published. The stock
acid off to $86 50, a further decline of $2 75.
Another Interesting security was the 6 per cent
bonds of the North Shore Railroad, which
defaulted on their interest along last October.
They began to rise last week, selling up to
par, and yesterday rose to $101, falling back
somewhat, however, at the close. The total
sales of bondi were $87,000. There was con
siderable doing In Gas and Electric at a slight
advance to $50 62H.
The brokers say that the current activity in
local stocks and bonds Is more or less due to
the desire of banks, large corporations and
individual capitalists to Invest their surplus
funds In view of the forthcoming tax assess
ment day in March. Of course dividends also
cut a large figure in this buying demand, as
in the case of the sugar stocks. Again, a
good many stocks have been rather low and
shreyd operators have lately started In to buy
from an investment or speculative point of
view. All these are factors in ths current
activity In local securities.
There was no particular change ln the min
ing â locks, trading being very fair and to

MARRY PAULINE
Mrs. Hulse's Breach of Prom
ise Suit Is Defeated in
Judge Kerrigan's Court
WOMAN POPS QUESTION
Ligda Testifies That He Was
Often Asked to Wed by
One of Prior Experience
"Woman proposes and man exposes,"
is a revision of the old axiom justified
by the proceedings and developments
of a breach of promise suit tried and
decided yesterday afternoon in Judge
Kerrigan's court. Pauline Hulse, a
Russian, twice married and once di
vorced, demanded $50,000 from Paul
Ligda, son of a former Greek Consul,
and a student at the University of
California, with literary aspirations,
because he had promised to marry her,
but had failed to take her to the altar.
Judge Kerrigan believed the young
man's sworn statement that he had
never asked the plaintiff to be his wife,
but had said "Nay, nay, Pauline" to
her repeated proposals, and judgment
for the defendant was entered accord-
lngly.
Mrs. Hulse told her story on the
stand. Llgda, she said, had been at
tentive when she was yet the wife of
Charles Hulse, a lodging-house keeper,
and promised to wed her when she was
divorced. After the separation, she
said, she went to Russia and Ligda
followed her with letters. She told of
meetings after her return from the
Cxar's domain, and in particular told
of a conversation on Kearny street,
wherein she asked Paul when he was
going to marry her, and he replied:
"Thursday or Friday, and then you will
be my wife."
This part of her evidence was corrob
orated by Mrs. May Jacobsen, who said
she was close behind the pair and
heard the question and answer. Her
seven-year-old daughter was along,
and she was called as a witness, the
defense waiving her taking the oath
and all questions as to her competency
to testify. Although it happened near
ly two years ago, the little girl told the
same story her mother told.
Then Ligda took the stand. His pro
nunciation is not of the plainest, but he
denied that he had ever requested Mrs.
Hulse to marry him, either before or
after her divorce; denied that he wrote
to her in Russia or elsewhere, and de
nied the stories of the meetings after
her return. Then came the man's ex
pose. "She was quite stuck on me,
and used to run after me all the time.
She forced herself on me, and I had to
read her Russian papers which were
sent to her. She always hinted that
she would make me a fine wife; that
she had been twice married and had
lots of experience in that way. I had
no position, and was a student at the
university, so I could not marry- She
came out several times and asked me
to marry her."
Lilgda's attorney, James H. Moyer,
attempted to question Ms client upon
Mrs. Hulse's moral reputation, but
Judge Kerrigan ruled him out. They
offered in evidence the decree wherein
Hulse was granted a divorce on the
ground of his wife's Intemperance.
The case was submitted without ar
gument, and Judge Kerrigan withheld
his decision until the parties had left
the courtroom.
Says He Was Beaten and Robbed.
James Riley, a miner from Mendo
cino County, complained to Police
men Duffy and Collins on Grant ave
nue, near Sutter street, early yester
day morning that he had been beaten
by two men and robbed.of $95. He
pointed out Joseph McElligott and
Robert Murray as the men who had
robbed him. They were arrested and
locked up in "the tanks" at the City
Prison pending developments. Riley
was under the influence of liquor and
was booked for being drunk. He has
a pair of black eyes. He was re
leased yesterday.

President Newhall of Cham
ber of Commerce Makes
a Series of Comparisons
POET GAINS IN TBADE
Large Figures Are Needed
to Indicate the Import
ance of City as Center
At the annual meeting of the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday reports
were submitted by President Newhall,
Secretary Scott and William M. Bun
ker, the Washington. D. C, represent
ative of the chamber. Incidental to
President Newhall's report ) he re
viewed the commercial conditions of
San Francisco. He said in part:
During the> year 1004 the total export trade,
by sea, from San Francisco ln value amounted
to more than $55,000,000, and the products oÂ£
California were more largely represented than
in any previous year. Notwithstanding the
heavy decrease In wheat export, owing to light
crops, this was an Increase ln our export busi
ness. The development of trade with the
Orient has passed all expectations and the
character of the business Indicates that it is
of a permanent nature.
The gain ln the Oriental trade over the year
1903 was $7,625,849. Exclusive of this there
were exports to Asia to other than the so
called Oriental countries amounting to nearly
$4,000,000. The year records, in addition to
this, for the first time four single out-going
cargoes of merchandise, namely, the Algoa,
October 29, whose cargo was valued at $1,
--470,000; Manchuria, on November 19, $1,768,
--000; Aztec, on November 25. $1,033,000, and
the Mongolia, on December 28, $1,645,000, and
this did not include the treasure, but simply
the merchandise.
The total import trade by sea during the
year 1904 was more than $43,000,000. Com
paring this with our previous year It shows
a nin of over $6,000,000.
The prosperity of San Francisco is shown by
the steady, substantial growth of the banks.
The commercial banks, with resources in ex
cess of $126,000,090 and deposits of over $70,
--000,000, amount to thirty-three. Eleven sav
ings banks, whose resources aggregate more
than $175,000,000 and their enormous deposits
of some $160,000,000, point to the general pros
perity of the city.
Say the city's population is 460,000. This
shows an average per capita of over $355 on
savings deposit account, a very 'â¢algh average.
The national banks, seven in number, have
resources of over $60,000,000 and deposits of
more than $25,000,000. The fifty-one banks
ln all ln the city count their deposits at over
$250,000,000.
The bank clearings of 1904 ln San Francisco
aggregated $1,534,631,137, being an Increase
over 1903 of $14,430,435. This increase aver
ages more than $1,200,000 a month. The bulk
of this business was gained during the last
half of the present year. San Francisco's
clearings are larger than the combined total
of all the clearing-house cities west of the
Rocky Mountains and more than five times
as great as the total of all the Puget Sound
cities combined.
The reports showed that a large
amount of work was done last year
by the chamber and that many top
ics were considered and action taken
thereon.
At the close of the annual meeting
the newly elected board of trustees
met for the purpose of organizing, Mr.
Newhall being in the chair. E. Scott
was re-elected secretary, D*easurer
and librarian. The standing commit
tees for the year were annbunced. It
was the sense of the board that a
communication be sent to William M.
Bunker in Washington requesting him
to confer with the California delega
tion to secure the use of a revenue
cutter for service among the codflsh
ing fleet in Bering Sea.
Fireman's Fund Elects Directors.
The annual meeting of the Fire
man's Fund Insurance Company was
held yesterday. The old board of di
rectors was re-elected. The directors

was made, which showed that on Jan
uary 1, 1905, the assets of the com
pany amounted to $6,526,439 and
there was a net surplus of $2,233,911.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. JANUARY 18, 1905.
ABLE SEAMAN NOT DISCREET
ENOUGH FOR SKIPPER.
MATE OF ANNIE SMALE COL
LIDES WITH THE VES
SEL'S COFFEE POT.
Captains Arm Swings True
While harboring more than an averÂ»
age allotment of the tender regard for
femininity that is such a beautiful
trait of sea-going character, Mate Al
fred Howard of the trim schooner An
nie Smale believed there should be a
denned limit to woman's prerogatives
and privileges on shipboard. Hoping
that his attitude would not be looked
upon as unchivalrous he desired to
opine that St. Paul's idea anent the
silencing of the gentler sex In churches
might profitably be applied on vessels.
Idealization of woman was all right
in the abstract, but it should not be
allowed to interfere with the mainten
ance of discipline on any craft. In
deed if petticoats were allowed aboard
at allâand, to be candid, he believed
they should notâany effort on their
part to participate in the working of
the ship should be severely reproved.
He had hinted as much to Captain Ed
ward Wirschuliet on more than one
occasion when the better half of that
mariner evinced disposition to usurp
command of the Annie Smale, and if
the skipper had then harkened to him
the incident of the coffee pot might
never have happened.
Very little of Mate Howard's head
was visible as he thus prefaced his
actual complaint in the court of Po
lice Judge Fritz. Bandages covered all
except one eye, a portion of one cheek
and his mouth. The remainder of his
countenance had been parboiled by cot
fee and was quickly anointed with lini
ment. He was seated at breakfast last
Sunday morning with Captain and
Mrs. Wirschuliet in the Annie Smale's
cabin, he testified, and he aod the
skipper were discussing the advisabil
ity of showing the schooner's respect
for the Sabbath 'by hoisting a flag at
her forepeak. It was a subject which
Mrs. Wirschuliet had no right to dis
cuss, as her prescribed duties were
confined to bossing the cook and cabin
boy and keeping her husband's ward
robe in repair. Regardless of that fact
she "butted ln," scouting the mate's
suggestion as to how and where the
flag should be displayed and offering
a most absurd suggestion of her own.
"With due respect to you, missis,"
said the mate, "you will oblige me by
keeping your jaw to yourself. The
skipper and I can settle this question
without any aid from you. So stow
your bloomin' gaff and attend to your
own business."
Then, the mate averred, Mrs. Wir
schuliet sprang to her feet and angrily
slapped his face. He gently pushed
her backward, he further averred,
when her husband picked up the large
pot of boiling coffee and smashed it
upon his head, the effect being a most
severe scalding, to say nothing of the
deep abrasion made by the blow.
Both the captain and his wife, a
tall and angular lady, swore that the
mate struck instead of shoved the lat
ter and that his language to her, prior
to the provocation of the face-slapping,
was too lurid for transcription. The
Judge took the case under advisement
and will have a decision ready ere the
Annie Smale is again prepared to de
part from her moorings at Third and
Berry streets.
Howard Caradoc Rees, the New
York clubman who threatened the
life of R. M. Gignoux at the Hotel
Princeton, resolutely declined to be
escorted to a sanitarium at Belmont,
and will be detained at the Receiving
Hospital until the Lunacy Commission
determine whether he is a fit subject
for the State Insane Asylum.
It was E. D. Roberts, a San Ber
nardino banker and distant relative of
Rees, who proposed the removal to a
sanitarium and announced willingness
to defray all the incidental expense.
When his offer was declined he with
drew from the case, as did Attorney
Oscar Cooper, who had been retained
to protect the defendant's interests.
The warrant alleging Insanity was
sworn to by Gignoux, who fears for his
life at the hands of the clearly de
mented prisoner.
"If any one attempts to remove me
to a sanitarium," Rees informed Rob
erts, "there will be a flght. I must
have liberty or nothing."
But Judge Mogan* believes it would
be unsafe to give the man liberty while
his reasoning is awry.
â¢ â¢ â¢
i Mrs. Agnes Tesner, grand secretary
and treasurer of the Ladies' Auxiliary
of the Switchmen's Union of North
America, has recovered possession of
the official seal of the order, which
was unlawfully carried away by Mrs.
Annie Miller, ex-grand mistress of the
auxiliary, from the headquarters, 1419
Valencia street. Judge Cabaniss heard
the complaint of Mrs. Tesner, also Mrs.
Miller's plea that she took the seal be
cause the order had bestowed its pat
ronage upon the family of a man who
committed some offense when he was
a boy, but has since led an industrious
and honest life. Mrs. F. Stoddard, an
other officer of the auxiliary, warmly
espoused the cause of Mrs. Tesner and
said some awfully sharp things to Mrs.
Miller.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"We've settled these matters," â¢ com
placently said the attorney for the de
fense when the case of Dorothy Mc-
Cabe, charged with having obtained
goods by false pretense from the Em
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
â¢ porium and the City of Paris, was
called in Judge Mogan's court.
"Oh, have you?" His Honor pleas
antly responded.
"Yes," was the equally pleasantly
spoken rejoinder. "The cases are all
settled, andâ"
"Well, we'll hear them any way,"
said the Judge, still smiling most af
fably. "Very thoughtful of you folk
to settle them, but I guess we'll give
them an inning here next Tuesday.
That's what we're here for, you know,
to hear cases."
The court continued smiling, but the
defense didn't.

For the sixth time within two years
Mrs. Michael Shea had her husband
arrested for disturbing the peace and
for the sixth time she declined to pros
ecute him.
* "I'm tired of this policy of yours,
Mrs. Shea," said Judge Fritz, "and the
next time Mr. Shea appears before me
on your complaint I'll send him to
jail whether you testify against him or
not. This court cannot afford to di
vert its time from serving as a collec
tion agency to act as an instrument
of intimidation for the convenience of
wives who desire to scare revolution
ary spouses. The next time you and
Mr. Shea agree to disagree you should
make the disagreement permanent."
"Come on, Mike," said Mrs. Shea,
and Mr. Shea docilely went, i

It was in the guise of a miner from
Tonopah that Policeman McManus in
veigled the Misses Louise Fitzgerald
and Florence Collins into the indiscre
tion of serving him with intoxicating
liquor and permitting him to pay for
it in their apartments on Ellis street.
He looked and acted like the tradi
tional man from the mines, whose sole
aim in life is to separate himself from
his money as expeditiously as possible,
and the ladles were never so astound
ed in all their born days as when he
disclosed his real character and mis
sion. they advanced the
technical plea that inasmuch as each
of them bought drinks after he had
treated them to beer, the gathering
was a social party and its participants
were therefore legally immune from
arrest for violation of the liquor laws.
Judge Mogan gave himself one week
to consult authorities relative to the
efficacy of the plea.
In different guise, that of a sailor,
also yearning to impoverish himself,
the same crafty McManus induced the
Misses Agnes Rockwell and Alma
Scott to temporarily transform their
apartments on O'Farrell street into a
barroom. So nautical were his make
up and his manner that neither Miss
Rockwell nor Miss Scott hesitated to
obey when he demanded to be served
with "a little drink." Miss Rockwell
told the desk sergeant that she al
most had a cat fit when their visitor
stood revealed ln his true colors, and
Miss Scott informed the same author
ity that anyone could have knocked
her down with a straw when McMan
us flashed his star. They will tell
Judge Mogan more about it to-mor
row.
So varied and ingenious and decep
tive are the disguises in which Mc-
Manus prowls the tenderloin in quest
of "blind pigs" that the Illegal traf
fic is greatly Impeded by the fear of
its conductors that they may be taken
in and done for by him. Indeed, some
of the more cautious lawbreakers in
sist on being presented with a certif
icate of identity ere they consent to
sell "a little drink" to any one. In
the language of an admiring brother
policeman, "McManus has 'em buffa
loed."
* c c
Nobody volunteered enlightenment
as to how or why Charles Hoffman,
hackdrlver, obtained his sobriquet of
"Nellie the Pups," nor did Judge Ca
baniss press for information on that
point. Sufficed It for him that Mr.
Hoffman complained that he was bat
tered by W. H. Van Horn, also a hack
driver, in the Club Stables, on Taylor
street. Mr. Van Horn averred that hts
nose was Jumped upon by Mr. Hoff
man ere he committed the alleged bat
tery, and the hearing was then con
tinued for one month.
c c â¢
"Theo Russell, a woman," is the
way it is written on Judge Mogan's
calendar, because Bailiffs Hickey and
Mahoney scoured the corridors of the
Hall of Justice in vain effort to find
Theo Russell, a man. The charge was
vagrancy and the defendant was at
large on ball.
"We can't find him," said Bailiff
Hickey breathlessly to the bench, and
the Judge was about to order the bail
forfeited when a flashily attired young
woman arose from among the spec
tators and proclaimed herself Theo
Russell. So taken aback was the court
that it continued the case till next
week in order to give itself time to
recover from the shock.
Patrick Daly, night watchman at
the Hibernia Brewery, 1241 Howard
street reported to the police yester
day that six men attempted to break
into the brewery about 8 o'clock on
Sunday morning. He saw them from
a fire escape, where he happened to
be at the time. He was unable to give
a description of the men except that
each was over six feet tall. >

THE MAYOR'S CHOICES
Several Candidates in Line
for Three Secretaryships
and Other Minor Positions
Mayor Schmitz did not put in an ap
pearance yesterday at his office, con
sequently the official announcement of
the appointments to the vacancies on
the Health and Park boards were de
layed, although the selection of Dr.
Sidney Worth and William H. Met
son, respectively, to the boards named
has been decided upon. Dr. Worth's
appointment was foreshadowed in last
Sunday's Call, while the fact that Met
son would be named on the Park Com
| mission has been frequently mentioned
ln these columns.
Dr. Worth owes his appointment to
Dr. James W. Ward, president of the
Health Board, to whom the selection
was left by the Mayor. Worth is a
graduate of the class of 1874 of the
Homeopathic Medical College of New
York and is a distinguished exponent
of the school, of which Dr. Ward is
also a prominent member.
Metson was really the only candidate
ever seriously considered for Park
Commissioner. Opposition to his ap
pointment came from certain quarters,
which, however, gradually simmered
down to a half hearted support, and
gave the Mayor the opportunity to de
cide in his favor. Metsorf's appoint
ment is considered as a rebuke to the
Phelan administration, as Metson was
the only Psrk Commissioner not re
appointed when the charter went into
effect in 1900. v
There have been no new develop
ments in the proposed "shift" of cer
tain city officials whereby Supervisor
Finn is to be transferred to the Fire
Commission in order that the Mayor
may name some man who can effective
ly champion his cause in the Board of
Supervisors against the McNab fac
tion. It is said that Fire Commissioner
Boyne will receive a more comfortable
billet to make way for Finn.
The appointments to the Police, Park
and Works boards and the storekeeper
ship of the Board of Education have
not been settled. James de Succa, who
has beesr mentioned for the storekeep
ership, may be made secretary of the
i [Board of Works, while Herbert
Schmltx, ithis said, will become for the
. second time secretary of the Park
j Commission. For the other places Bar
i ney Flood, John Fitzgerald and George
i Berger are being considered.
WORKS BOARD MAY CANCEL
STREET REPAIR CONTRACT
Commissioner Aigeltinger to Present
Resolution So Work May Be
Done by the City.
Commissioner of Works Aigeltinger
decided yesterday to prepare a reso
lution for presentation to the Board
of Works at its meeting to-day declar
ing the contract of the F. M. Torke
Company for repairing bituminous
streets canceled in the event that the
company refuses to continue the work.
Algeltinger stated that he. would at
once enter into arrangements where
by the Board of Works itself will un
dertake the task of repairing the
numerous chuckholes in the streets by
day labor.
The company has promised to file
an answer to-day as to whether It will
agree to resume the repairs. In al!
likelihood the answer will be in the
negative, as the members of the com
pany have expressed themselves to
that effect.
ONE PARENT COMPLAlNS.âSuperintend
ent Langdon stated yesterday that one parent
had complained of the transfer of the primary
classes of the James Lick School to the Noe
Valley School, because it necessitated her child
walking a few blocks more. Other complaints
are expected, but Langdon says the complaint
la without merit as the two schools are only
four blocks and a half apart.

DISCOVERS MAN
UNDER HIS BED
H. Bobinson, Musician From
Portland, Has Peculiar Ex
perience on His Arrival
H. Robinson, a musician from Port
land, obtained a warrant from Police
Judge Mogan yesterday for the arrest
of "John Doe" Kline on a charge of
burglary. Robinson says he arrived in
the city on January 7. His wife pre
ceded him.
Late in the afternoon Robinson went
to the ferry to get his grips, and
dropped into a saloon to have a drink.
While chatting with the bartender
Kline came in and joined in the con
versation. Robinson remarked that
his grips were heavy, and Kline offered
to help him carry them. They got the
grips and took them to the United
States Hotel on Eddy street. Robinson
says he could not get rid of Kline for
some hours, but finally he gave him
the slip in-a saloon.
About an hour later Robinson went,
to his room and discovered Kline un :
der the bed. He ordered him out of
the room. Next morning, while Rob
inson was dressing, he discovered that
his watch and chain and $250 in coin
had been stolen from his pockets. He
came to the conclusion that Kline
had returned when he was asleep,
crawled through the transom and
stole his property.
Robinson says he did not report the
burglary earlier because he was ad
vised to consult an attorney with the
object of recovering his loss from the
proprietor of the hotel owing to the
defective transom, which" had no glass
in it.
MURDERER OF RANCHER IS
BROUGHT FROM HOLLISTER
Richard Maligna, Who Shot and
Killed Charles Zanders, to Be
Tried at Merced.
Richard Maughs. who shot and
killed Charles Zanders, a young
rancher in Merced County on Sun
day, was brought from Holister to the
Cltv Prison here yesterday morning by
Under Sheriff W. O. Moore. In the
afternoon Moore left with his prisoner
for Merced.
According to Moore the murder was
a cold-blooded one. Maughs was cook
at the ranch and had also to look af
ter the fences. On Sunday Zanders
checked him for allowing some cattle
to stray through a broken fence and
Maughs shot him dead while they
were within a few feet of each other.
Edward Cole, Zanders' partner, and a
ranch hand were close by at the time.
Maughs armed himself with a shot
gun and revolver and left the ranch.
Cole rode into Hollister and notified
Sheriff Croxon of San Benito County,
who wired to Moore. Moore and an
armed posse started out to search for
the murderer and learned that he had
returned and surrendered himself to
Hugh French, owner of an adjoining
ranch, who took him to Hollister.
â¢ Maughs told Moore that it was his
original intention to put up a fight
and if he saw ,that. his capture was
Inevitable he was to commit suicide.
He was brought round this way be
cause Moore said It was an easier
Journey than driving seventy-five
miles by road from Hollister.
