BY THE GRAND JURY ON CHARGE
OF SUBORNATION OF PERJURY
THE Grand Jury yes
terday morning
brought in an indict
ment against Frank A.
Maestretti, president of the
Board of Public Works,
charging him with subor
nation of perjury. The in
dictment was the result of
testimony given by Charles
E. Merrill. C. M. Silber
stein and W. H. Podd to
the effect that Maestretti
approached them and asked
them to testify that Charles
\\ yman, the convicted
stuffer, did not vote more

When the announcement was made
yeatPrday morning that Frank A.
Maestrctti. president of the Board of
Public Works, had been indicted by
the Grand Jury on a charge of subor
nation of perjury it created a sensation
in political circles. The jury brought
in the indictment shortly after 11
o'clock in Judge Lawlor's court. Six
hours later Maestretti surrendered
himself to a Deputy Sheriff and was
immediately released on $3000 bonds,
furnished by the Aetna â¢ Indemnity

it did.

SALT LAKE. Utah, March 22 â
Leaving 362 living descendants to
mo-urn her passing. Mrs. Sarah Ann
Woolf of Hyde Park, Utah, is dead at
the age of i*l years. She left 10 chil
dren, 81 grandchildren, 189' great

Absalom Woolf, is past 73 years of age.
Mrs. Woolf. whose maiden name was
Devoe. was born in Wcstchester Coun
ty. New York, in 1814. She married

band, joined the Mormon Church. They
traveled with the Mormons through
Ohio, Illinois and Missouri and made
the overland journey to Utah with the
first Mormon pic-neers in 1847. Their
early life in Utah was characterized by
the adventures that came to other pio
neers â drought, famine, Indian raids,
etc â and they were several times com
pelled to change their residence.
Mrs. Woolf. with an infant a year old
to care for, drove a team from the Mis

many years after reaching Utah assist
ed her husband in building log cabins,
digging water ditches, sowing crops
and performing other manual labor.
Her husband died many years ago and
since that time Mrs. Woolf had lived
at the homes of her sons, six of whom
survive her.
Mrs. Woolf enjoyed unusually good
health throughout her long life and re

OMAHA, March 22.â Suits to compel
several large business houses in Omaha
to fulfill boodle contracts with the
county are to be instituted at once at
the instance of the Municipal League.
As a result firms which are under con
tract to supply groceries, drugs and
other supplies for the courthouse, poor
farm and County Hospital are in a fair
way to lose thousands of dollars.
It was shown in a recent investiga
tion that since the contracts are
awarded to the lowest average bidder,
the favored bidders have in many in
stances offered articles for which it is>
certain there will be little or no call
at merely nominal prices, while ar
ticles largely in demand are offered at
two to three times the regular retail
price. In the contract for drugs, for
instance, Clark's rye is contracted for
at $3 per gallon, while Duffy's malt
whisky, which wholesales at $9 per
dozen quarts, is offered the county at
1 tent a quart. It is proposed in this
instance that the county be compelled
to purchase Duffy's malt at the nom
inal price offered in the contract.
Similar comparisons are made in
other line 3. It is shown that the
county has paid 50 cents for candles
which sell at 9 cents a pound whole
sale: $6 50 per 1000 for printed note
heads 111 large or small quantities; 50
cents a dozen for common penholders
which sell at 1 cent each. In gco
cery contract cream of wheat, which
costs 12>4 cents, is offered at 3 cent* a
package.
In every case where low prices were
fixed for certain articles and high
prices for similar articles (the con
tractors evidently having assurance
that the latter would be ordered by
the county officials) the county will be
compelled if possible by the Munici
pal League to purchase the low-priced
article exclusively.

Special Dispatch to Tht Call.
PHILADELPHIA. March 2tâPhila
delphia is the center of the greatest
gang of get-rich-quick swindlers that
ever operated in the United States.
This fact has been fully established
by a protracted investigation conduct
ed by the Philadelphia North American
in an effort to close up the Storey
Cotton Company, which proposed pay
ments of imvM>ssiMe profits. The
Storey Cotton Company went t â¢ > :u: v
v.all last Thursday with assets of ?.V},
000 and liabilities totaling into the lil
lions. It was followed on Tuesday by
the Provident Investment Bureau, an
allied concern, whlrh. turned up atsetis
of <>nly $3000 and- liabilities fouling up
nearly $1,000,000. I
The history of these frands goes
back to ihe tiir...- of., frank Â« '. Marrin.
a prosperous' young Brooklyn^ la v s yer.
He was accused of being an emoteskr
for about, $70.000, . money entrusted to
him for investment by one of his cli
ents. Mrs. Caroline Barry, a widow.
Marrin fled to Europe. He was Indict
ed in Brooklyn for forgery and eriib *-
zlement and the indictments are still
pending.
After a short while spent in Europe.
Marrin went to Central America and
from there to Chicago, where he ap
peared in 1896: He was broke and re
duced to the p' jilt of sellinc? shoestrings
on the street. He subsequently se
cured employment with a press-clip
ping bureau at $7 a week, and while
to employed fell in \vivh a man who
was known as W. R. Bennett. In Chi
cago Marrin use<l the alias Frank M.
Stone. He and Lsenr>.t?tt organized the
Chicago Bank Depositors' and Invest
ors' Protective Association with offices
in the Rialto building* Chicago, and
professed to be able to give inside in
formation to subscribers about the
many get-rich-quick concerns that
were operating in that city at the time.
I'LEE TO SAX IRAXCISCO.
This concern quickly gave way to the
Investors' Protective Association, which
was a blind used by Marrin and Ben
nett, while these two men, the former
under the second alias of Edward
Dunne, promoted the Securities Sav
ings Society, which ran a blind pool
on horse races. The schemes were kr>pt
afloat until February. 1000. when Mar
rin. under thr> alias of Edward Dunne,
took his stenographer, Mrs. Sophiii
Beck, and fled to San Francisco. Ben
nett grabbed $300,000 of the loot and
got away.
Marrin and the Beck woman were
chased by the Chicago police from that
city to San Francisco and thence to
New Orleans, where they were both
arrested on Ksbruary 17, 1900. Marrin
had $75,000 cash with him when ar
rested, and although indicted and de
spite the fact that witnesses were
taken from Chicago he managed to
escape extradition. The effort cost him
$10,000.
He then came to Philadelphia, hav
ing established his family here pre
vious to his flight from Chicago. He
bought a handsome house on South
Forty-fourth street and appeared here
as "Judge" Franklin Stone, lawyer and
turfman, from Kentucky. Almost im
mediately he opened offices for a fake
importing firm known as Storey & Co.,
in which the partners were alleged to
be Franklin E. Storey and Francis
Stone.. This firm was a blind for Mar
rin, who at the same time was t>ro
rnoting the firm of Arthur S. Foster &
Co., cotton specialists.
AID FROM WASHINGTON.
Marrin went to Europe almost im
mediately after launching Storey & Co.
and the Foster fraud, being represented
In the latter concern by an Englishman
known as Arthur S. Foster-Francis.
In business this man passed as Foster;
socially and at his hotel he was known
a? Francis. Once each week Francis
called at Marrln's home on South
Forty-fourth street and secured from
Mrs. Marrin a check to defray the cur
rent expenses of floating the Foster
outfit.
This latter concern was put out of
business on September 19. 1900. by a
fraud order issued ostensibly on the
ground of fraud, but in reality because
the man Francis, who was identified by
postal inspectors and showed a crooked
record in New Orleans, appeared as
the nominal head and manager. Fol
lowing the collapse of the Foster fraud,
Marrin produced an Englishman who
passed as F. Ewart Storey and who
paid the remaining debts of the Foster

were being wound up Marrin went to
Washington and from the Machen-

Charles A. Smurthwaite, who is In pro

apostasy in criticising the acts of Pres-1
ident Joseph Smith, as charged by his
teacher. H. H. Goddard, to-day filed
charges with the bishop of bia ward in
Ogden against Goddard. charging the
latter with living with two wives and
having children by them, contrary to
the revelation known as the "mani
festo," and contrary to the laws of the
State.
This in the first time a direct charge
of violation of the ecclesiastical and
State laws In the matter of polygamy
has ever been preferred by a member
of the church, and the incident is re
garded as significant, as the case, if
brought to trial in the bishops" court,
will force the church to declare its po

cohabitation.

subjf-rt and having been asked by him
to go to the front and try to save
Wyman. Podd was the first to offer
his testimony, he having already re
lated to the (jraud Jury several days
ago all he knew about the case. His
lestfrnony yesterday was supplemental.
Silberptetn was^an election judge in
the thirty-ninth district at the time the
ill" g^tl voting happened. He gave the
Grand Jury no information till it had
pecured the story from Podd. When
Silversteln heard of this he forsook his
reticence and told all he knew. With
Merrill's tale to back up the other two
statements the jury felt safe in taking
action.
Fairfax Wheelan apain repeated his
oft -told story of how the stuffing was
carried on in the primaries. B. EL
Mann, whose name was illegally voted
by Wynian, was also present and re
told to the jurors what he knew about
the case.
Foreman Andrews asked to be cx
euSed from voting when the jui*y had
assembled and was re*dy to proceed.
He told Judge Lawlor he might be
I btased and prejudiced and did not want
t" take any chances of having the in
dictment attacked on these grounds. .
Judge Lawlor excused Andrews and
Jurors Bowes and Sppck made similar
requests, which were heeded.
Judge Lawlor appointed James B.

It was expected that Maestretti

he did not put in an appearance during

he asked "They tell me you want me
here."
Yes, I've got a warrant that I want
to serve on you," said the Deputy
Sheriff, as he approached Maestretti.
The latter smiled again and went intq
the chambers with his lawyer, where
the bond was arranged aijd he was
quickly dismissed.
" It is all a conspiracy," said Maes
tretti. "These men who testified against
me are a lot of weak-minded individ

men who would overthrow me. It came

to prevent removal to Washington.
Judge Ray delayed the case for more
than a year and it was only after the
strongest pressure was brought by of
ficials of the Department of Justice
that he finally rendered a decision.
Week before last a petition was
drawn up at the, department here for
an immediate decision of the case, re
citing the facts of the delay and the
evident attempt to prevent justice tak
insr its course. This was sent to Dis
trict Attorney Curtis at Binghamton
for him to sign and present, to Judge
Ray. He deferred action and entered
into correspondence with the depart
ment. Then two telegrams were sent
to him from Washington, ordering him
to sign at once. < This he did. The pe
tition went to Judge Ray on Saturday,
March 11, and on Monday, March 13.
Judge Ray rendered his decision.
So determined "was the Department of
Justice that this case should not be
longer delayed- that preparations had
been made for a writ of mandamus to
bring the proceedings up to the Su
preme Court of the United States for
the purpose of having that tribunal
demand a decision one way or the
other.

DRAMATIC
SCENE II
COURTROOM

. Spare Son,
Continued From Pag* 1, Column 7.
tense silence reigned in the courtroom.
It was only broken now and then by a
suppressed so-b from a woman.
MARKS HIS BEST EFFORT.
In an even, modulated voice, the
father poured out his appeal. He had
addressed many assemblages, he had
tried to convince parties and factions;
but never before had he put every
effort of his intellect into an address,
never had he desired so earnestly in
his heart and soul to convince an audi
tnce so much as he did those twelve
men yesterday.
He was pleading for the life of his
Itsi born, pleading to prevent his
i'aithfjl \vif<- from being mado a broken
hearted woman, pleading to save his
othor children from the shadow of
disgrace. It was the oratorical master
piece of his life.
What t<. him was the ability to
sway multitudes' if it could not save
the life of his son? What were the
triumphs of the past if he could not,
when his whole heart and soul were
in the effort, touch the hearts of those
twelve jurors?
Senator Goucher felt all these things
as he made his pathetic appeal. He
tried to feel the confidence that helped
him when he swung the mutable many,
tut it was evident that he could not.
He pulled himself together and made
his appeal. Irresolution is not in the
Coucher make-UD.
"Surely, not even the most ambitious
District Attorney could wish to earn
Ma laurels at the expense of my boy's
life. Surely, not one citizen of this
great-hearted State but would greet
you with outstretched hands were you
t<> bring in a verdict that would send
this hoy back to his mother's out
stretched arms.
"To be merciful is bettor than to be
just. If my boy fell into bad company,
if he formed acquaintances that made
of him a tool â blame the Creator, who
makes youths unwise and knaves to
bear the semblance of men."
The father's voice sank lower and
lower, the mother sobbed, the accused
criminal bowed his head. Leaning to
ward the jury. Senator Goucher con
cluded:
"Now, gentlemen, I am finished. The
case is in your hands. You have the
louver to deal with my boy when I do
not. After I quit talking there will
be no words said in his behalf. I must
remain mute during the remainder of
this trial."
IS SHAKEN BY EMOTION.
For an instant the father stood si
lent before the jury. His lips moved
and his body shook as if he were re
straining with an effort, a desire to
bur^tj.iutq a Jast passiohatÂ© appeal for
mercy, but, he turned slowly and
walked to where his son sat.
The father patted the accused mur
derer upon the back, and Alan Goucher
placed his arm for a moment around
the father's neck. The last words that
could be spoken in "Kid" Goucher's
behalf had been uttered by the father.
All through the proceedings the sis
ter of the murdered man sat heavily
veiled in a corner of the courtroom.
She neither spoke nor moved.
With relentless, stern and persistent
effort, District Attorney Byington pro
ceeded to tear aside every bit of sen
timent that the faithful father had
built around "Kid" Goucher, the ac
cuesed murderer.
"I say," thundered the District At
torney, "that that man Goucher is as
cold blooded and desperate a criminal
as ever walked the streets of San
Francisco."
Instantly Attorney Reese Clark, one
of the lawyers for the defense, ut
tered a shrill protest, but he was si
lenced by the court. At frequent inter
vals the quavering voice of the lawyer
from the foothills Interrupted the Dis
trict Attorney.
Heedless of interruption, oblivious to
everything but the stern duty before
him, Byington continued: "This case
is being watched by two classes of peo
ple â the criminal element that hangs
even around the Hall of Justice."
Senator Goucher interrupted with a
strenuous objection.
"Yes," continued Byington, "you have
what the criminals call the yegg men,
who look upon this man as a hero, and
on the other hand there is every man
who does not sympathize with crim
inals and murderers.
"The men who were associated with
this prisoner in crime are waiting to
receive him with open arms if justice
is not done. Ac certain as he goes free
he goes back to a life of crime. There
is not one redeeming feature in his
character.
DENOUNCES "RID" OOCCHER.
'This is the man who, when that
brave policeman lay dying on the side
walk, fired into his prostrate body.
Why, he is a fiend Irom hell.
"If it were not for this man, Officer
Eugene C, Robinson would be alive to
day. But Goucher, with revolver in
hand and murder in his heart, said 'I'm
not going to run.' That man fired the
.38-caiiber bullet Into the writhing
body.
"If he were loose and met you on the
highway, 'Up with your hands, gentle
men, on peril of yotir-Mves!' x There is
only one crime worse than Goucher's,
that is to turn him loose to resume his
career of crime.
"The counsel for the defense have
sneered at Policeman Taylor. Police
man Taylor is too brave a man to tell
a lie. I take off my hat to Taylor. To
his honor, be it said, he never halted
on that night. He went straight after
three armed men, and never halted.
Give Detectives Dinan and Wren the
credit for running down six of the most
desperate criminals that ever infested
this city. Thank God we have officers
brave enough to do their duty.
"A braver man than Policeman Rob
inson never lived. Am In the case of
heroes of history, the best that can be
said of a man can be said of him: 'He
died in the performance of his duty.' "
Attorney Clark again interrupted.
"Oh let us have a little common
sense," suggested Byington. The court
silenced the lawyer from the foothills.
"Gentlemen," continued the District
Attorney, "to bring In a verdict of
manslaughter would be as outrageous
as to acquit this man. This Is murder,
and murder In the first degree. It
would be a great mistake if you should
abate one iota from your convictions,
you owe it to the State and to your
selves to convict this man."
As the defense Insisted that the in
structions of Judge Cook to the Jury
be rriade in writing, the District Attor
ney asked for a recess. He will con
clude to-morrow, and the case will go
to the Jury before noon.
All the while Bylnston was relent
FULL REVIEW OF STANFORD CASE
PREPARED FOR RELATIVES
Task Is Assigned to
Detectives and
Lawyers.
Investigations Are Under
Suspension for
Cause.
Mountford Wilson is awaiting the full
report of Captain Callundan of the
Morse agency as to the death of Mrs.
Stanford at Honolulu. Meantime ttm
work of the detectives in unraveling
the Poland water mystery was tem
porarily interrupted yesterday. Cap
tain Callundan is to write a full re
view of the evidence gathered in the
island metropolis for perusal by the
Stanford representatives, and the task
requires some time.
At the office of the Police Depart
ment it was said that the detectives
were inactive during the day so far
as the Stanford case was concerned.
'Yes, we have about come to the
conclusion that Mrs. Stanford died
from natural causes," said Captain
Burnett. The report made to him by
Detective Reynolds is the basis for this
conclusion, and it means the discredit
ing of the" Honolulu authorities, who
continue to assert that Mrs. Stanford
was poisoned.
The Honolulu case disposed of, it re
mains for the detectives to solve the
Poland water-poisoning in this city on
January 14. Burnett sought to make
it appear yesterday that he left it to
the Morse agency to work out the mys
tery. He explained that it began its
investigations in January, having a
start of several weeks before the Po
lice Department was apprised of the
case, and has therefore been enabled
to cover the field much more thor
oughly.
It is known, however, that the de
tectives think they have the Poland
water case well in hand and feel they
have the evidence in shape to Justify
making formal charges at any time.
Mountford Wilson holds the reins,
however, and what course will be pur
sued must be decided by the attorney
for the Stanford representatives.
Two persons are under suspicion and
one or the other, it is expected, will be
charged with the poisoning within a
short time.
The news published exclusively in
The Call shortly after the death of
Mrs. Stanford that Miss Berner had
pointed the finger of suspicion at Ah
Wing, the Chinese cook, who also
served as a factotum in the Stanford
household, is verified by the statement
that Miss Berner made to the detec
tives. While she refuses to say that
she regards him as a suspect, her
statement as to probabilities placed
the Chinese strongly in the light of
suspicion and caused the detectives to
maintain watch over him.
THE BERNER STATEMENT.
The following is the part of Miss
Berner'a statement In point:
I had no conversation veith Wing, the Chi
nese housekeeper, as to who might possibly
have done this thing. He never accused me
of doing it. On the day before we left San
Francisco on the Korea I asked Wing to come
ti my ooui. I did so because Mrs. Stan'ord
told me to. On the previous afternoon Mrs.
Stanford had an engagement to meet Mr.
Lathrop and Mr. Sloos on business and told me
to go on before her to the house. About dusk.
Mrs. Stanford arrived. I said to her, "Oh,
why did y<_u come so late? I was Just coming
down." She said, "I have been walking for
some time. I did not come straight to the
hotel. I won't take off my things, but we will
KO back to the hotel." When we left the
house Mri. Stanford said to me, "I was very
much frightened by Wing when I came in. He
j met me in the lower hall and he wa^ very
j much excited. 1 never saw him in such a
state. He thinks you are not his friend. I
don't like it. Bfr.tha, and you had better sea
Wing and find out what it means."
So the next day 1 called Wing Into my
room. I said to him, "Wing, you frightened
Mrs. Stanford last night. You were very
much excited and talked very loud. What
do you mean?" Â«Wing replied. "Well, Bertha,
you are very cross about coffee." I told him
1 understood all about it; that he must think
no more of the matter. Wing replied, "You
and I friends long 1 time. You no friend now."
I said to him. "I don't know why you say
so. 1 am your frir-nd now, Just as much aÂ»
I ever was, and whatever you do don't go
about frightening Mrs. Stanford." Wing did
not at that time say. "Bertha, I think you
did this." He did not say, "Bertha, I didn't
see you do it. but I think you did. and you
know If you did or not." No conversation of
that kind occurred. Mrs. Stanford never told
me that Wins had openly accused me to
her. 1 know that if Wing had ever made an
accusation Mrs. Stanford would have told
me. Mrs. Stanford never told me that she
thought Wing had done the thing. â¢ She never
mad* the Statement that Richmond had done
it. ShÂ»; never said to me, "Bertha, do you
think Richmond did it?"
I went over the whole list of servants with
Mrs. Stanford, beginning with the cook. I said
to her, "Now, Mrs. Stanford there is so and
so in thp houae. There Is the cook. I don't
know whether he is of amiable character or
objectionable I don't know his helper. I
don't know thÂ» new butler. I don't know tha
butler's helper. I know very little about the
Chinese boy who works upstairs. I do know
Wing. I have known him fÂ»r many years. In
my mind he could not do so terrible a thing.
I do know Richmond and I don't think her
capable of such an act, nor could I believe
It of Nora." In this way I went through
the whole list.
ONLY ONE HAVING MOTIVE.
At the time of the death of Henry Uathrop
Wing told Mrs. Stanford that he had .promised
him $1000 No Information to this effect had
been given to Mrs. Stanford by Mr. Lathrop.
but she promised Wing ho should have the
money and Â«al<i to him further. "Wing, if
you will remain with me while I live, you
will have some more." Wing was then getting
ready to go to China and wu very eager to
get his $1000 before leaving. He received It
all right and Mrs. Stanford again urged him to
be rurÂ» and coma back to her and promise to
remain with her while she lived. She â¢aid
to him. "If you do you will not be the poorer
for it." I relate this only in the search for
the motive, not because I wtah to Imply any
connection with Wing and the poison affair
from anything I saw in the man's action. That
I do not wieh to imply. I cannot from my
knowledge of the servants of f the house, and
from what I know what any of them might
do. I cannot in my mind implicate any one.
I cannot cay that prior to leaving San Fran
cisco I felt that if anybody In the house did
the poisoning it vu likely "Wing I cannot
say that I ever at any time had m suspicion
that Wing did It. I don't think that I ever
made such a statement. I could find a motive
only In Wing of all the eenrants, but from
my knowledge of the boy and his actlonÂ» I do
not think that he did it. All I mean is that
from thinking over the matter thÂ» only on*
in the house that could have a possible motive
for. poisoning Mrs. Stanford la Win*. That
possible motive, of course, would be a financial
one. No one else in the house I know of
would have been benefited by Mm. Stanford's
death. I have carefully considered everything.
I hayÂ» no opinion of who did the poisoning.
Everything points to the supposition that It
must have been done by some one In the house,
but I have really no opinion as to who It
was. I repeat that If anybody In the house
among the help who had a motive It was Wing.
lessly proving how strong thfe net was
woven about "Kid" Goucher, the father
stood with a ghastly smile on his face.
"I have to hold together," he explain
ed. "If my wife saw me downcast she
would collapse."
"Kid" Goucher's shifty eyes watched
the District Attorney furtively while
he spoke. The prisoner smiled fre
quently, apparently to reassure Jiis
mother.
The District Attorney will begin his
final argument at 10 a, m. to-day.

Where Body Lies.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
22.â The gloom that has pervaded the
campus since the death of Mrs. Stan
ford has become deeper since the ar
rival of the body yesterday from the
funeral train at Menlo Park. Little
knots of mourning students are stand
ing around the deserted quadrangle or
sitting in the Memorial Church listen
ing to the hymns that Organist Blodg
ett plays every afternoon. There are
no recitations going on and all college
work is at a standstill.
The body of Mrs. Stanford Is not
lying In state at her residence on the
Palo Alto estate. There is a guard
around the house and only the rela
tives and the old servants are allowed
to enter. The closed coffin lies in the
drawing-room of the mansion covered
with beautiful flowers. Miss Nora Hop
kins, the housekeeper, has entire
charge of the residence.
The employes of the estate have
raised a large sum with which to show
their respect for the memory of their
mistress. They will have made a large
floral piece to be placed just outside
the Memorial Church. Probably no
class feels the loss of Mrs. Stanford as
keenly as do these employes of the
stock farm. They were hired by Sen
ator Stanford and have always felt
that they were the real protectors of
the mistress. Mrs. Stanford dearly
loved these men because they repre
sented the things jthat most interested
her husband. They will all attend the
funeral services in a body.
On Friday, the day of the funeral,
the Sheriff of Santa Clara County will
appoint a large force of deputies to
patrol the university grounds. While
the seating accommodations are very
limited, yet the faculty in charge ex
pect that there will be an enormous
crowd of outsiders and they are mak
ing these preparations so that there
will be perfect order. It Is probable
that on the day of the funeral no car
riages will be allowed on the univer
sity grounds. With the exception of
the relatives and the ministers who
speak, the long funeral procession from
the Memorial Church to the mausoleum
will be made on foot.

BEEF TRUST
JURY DRAWN
CHICAGO, March 22.â The special
grand jury to investigate the so-called
"beef trust" was completed to-day.
Three vacancies left in the panel yes
terday were filled and the huge mass
of testimony available was immedi
ately attacked.
District Judge J. Otis Humphrey
charged the jury to "present no one
from envy, hatred or malice, nor to
leave any one unrepresented by reason
of fear, favor, affection, reward or hope
of reward."
The charge to the jurors was de
livered in an lmpressite manner and
was listened to with deep interest.
Judge Humphrey said:
This body sfndJi oetwÂ«Â«n the upright and
honest cltisen and the malicious accuser. You

Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
CHICAGO, March 22â A sensational
i sequel to the Harper wheat corner ot
! 1887 is promised when the bankruptcy
â  proceedings of E. L- Harper are aired
In court in Bristol, Virginia. Kvidence
is now being gathered in Chic ago to
i show the operations of several West
>em financiers connected wtth tne
1 Standard Oil Company, and ru>\v these
; operations led to the greatest wheat
panic in the history of the country.
â  The developments will show, it is said,
: that the greater part of the $10,000,000
1 lost on the Chicago Board of Tra4Â«
; during that memorable occasion went
1 into the pockets of this coterie. It it
j alleged that these Standard Oil men
j were ostensibly backers of Harper,
j then a Cincinnati banker, but that they
i sold him out.
Judgments against Harper are held
In Chicago to the extent of several
million dollars. Twenty-three firms
failed on the Board of Trade on June
14, 1887, and at least fifty other firms
lost all they had. Thousands of fami
lies were ruined by the wheat corner
engineered by Harper.
E. L. Harper is now attempting to
have himself declared a bankruÂ»t. Al
though he is vice president and man
ager of the Union Iron and Steel Com
pany of New York, a concern with a
capital of W. 000,000, Harper is said to
own only one share of stock.

POPE PIUS X
PLANS REFORMS
tpecia! DiepMch to ThÂ« Call.
ROME, March 22. â Pope Pius X has
prepared a pamphlet which will bÂ«
published anonymously by the Vatican
I-ress. It records the acts of his pon
tificate and announces contemplated re
forms, especially regarding the clergy
and the ecclesiastical fees, which have
diminished.
The Vatican has been informed that
Monsignur Pallullon, Bishop of Samo
gizia, Russia, has left Samogizia for
Rome, with the permission of the Rus
sian Government, to report to the Pope
the result of the meetings between
Russian and Polish bishops to express
their desire to St. Petersburg for meas
ures insuring liberty of religion. The
Vatican is not certain of the real In
tentions of Russia, fearing that her pol
icy may be to merely keep the Polish
Catholics quiet for the moment.
The Vatican has received the resig
nation of Cardinal Netto as Patriarch
of Lisbon, which is quite unusual con
sidering the many prelates who, al
though older, occupy even more re
sponsible positions. The pretext for
the Cardinal's resignation is his health.
NEW YORK TELEPHONE
RATES TO BE REDUCED
Toils to Be Lowered in the Metropo-
lis From Ten to Twenty
Per Cent.
NEW YORK. March 22. â Official
announcement of a reduction of tele
phone tolls in Manhattan, to take ef
fect on May 1, has been made by
JLTnion N. Bethell, first vice president
and general manager of the New York
Telephone Company. All direct line
business subscribers of the company
will be charged the new schedule of
rates, regardless of the rates named in
the contract now existing between the
subscribers and the company.
What reduction will be made In the
tolls between the various boroughs of
Greater New York is as yet unknown,
but the schedules made public so far
fhow that rates for direct line business
will be lowered on the basis of 20 per
cent to small subscribers and about 10
per cent to larger subscribers. In
other words, a customer who now pays
$75 a year for 600 outgoing messages
will obtain the same service for $60.
The subscriber who pays $228 now for
4500 calls will pay $204, a reduction
of about 10 per cent.
WOMAN IN HER COFFIN

TELL CITY. Ind., March 22. â Mrs.
Susan Sulzer, who apparently dropped
dead ten days ago as she was entering
her home In Cannellton and whose
body was placed in the cemetery vault
two days later, is believed by many
persons to be alive. Her relatives are
convinced that life is not extinct and
a specialist from Cincinnati has been
summoned and an investigation will be
made.
During the time that the body has
been In the vault it has been watched
closely and several times apparent
signs of life have been detected. Since
her supposed death the wound on her
head caused by the fall has continued
to bleed at Intervals and her face re
mains flushed. A few days ago a local
physician punctured one of her fingers
and brought blood.

SWOOPING
DOWN UPON
DOMINGO
Belgium the First Nation
to Take Advantage of Sen
ate's Refusal to Carry
Out the President's Plans
THREATENS SEIZURE
OF AN ISLAND PORT
To Add to the Troubles
of Morales Revolutionists
May Attempt to Wrest
the Government From Him
SAN DOMINGO. March 22.â The
news of the postponement by the Unit
ed States Senate of action on the treaty
with Santo Domingo makes the situa
tion here acute, and an internal upris
ing seems to be Imminent, based on the
cry that President Morales has been
discredited in the United States. Pres
ident Morales says that he is prepared
to put down any revolution, but that a
mor^ serious problem in his mind is
foreign complications growing out of
Belgium's demand, presented on March
21.
feelgium wants the customs receipts
of a port of Santo Domingo to the ex
tent of $25,883 a month, according to a
former agreement on which no pay
ment has been made for three years.
This first demand is construed as a
direct result of the failure of the treaty
between the United States and Santo
Domingo. President Morales expects
similar demands by other powers,
which he will be helpless to resist. He
cays he wants to pay all the republic's
debts, but sees the ruin of the country
with every port In the hands of a dif
ferent foreign power and no revenue
for the Government. While he sees no
light ahead, he has blind faith that
"right will triumph."
In the course of an interview Morales
said to-day:
It is entirely pofeible that the United
States may have to etnd an ultimatum here,
on account of the Dominican CJovernment be
ing unable, though not unwilling, to meet its
obligations. It Is utterly Impossible for the
Government to pay the sums due foreign gov
ernments unless the United States can pro
cure from foreign powers a postponement of
their demands. Otherwise those demands will
be pressed. I have no physical or moral force
to resist them. With the custom-houses In
the control of the I'nlted States the resources
of the Islands will develop speedily and al!
demands will be paid, with the result tbat
the country w!l! be educated to peace and
permanent prosperity.
With two Dominican ports in the
hands of the United States and the
failure of the treaty, Dominicans be
lieve that a grab game by foreign pow
ers will begin at once. An Italian
cruisar was here a few days ago, but
withdrew to Kingston.
The American gunboat Castine is
here with 150 men: the cruiser Chatta
nooga is at Samana Bay; the Detroit
is at Puerta Plata, and the Dixie is at
Mc.-nte Cristi. Rear Admiral Sigsbee
hag gone to Guantanamo for consulta
tion with Hear Admiral Barker.
With the seizure of Dominican ports
by foreign powers, it is argued here,
the Monroe doctrine will be nullified as
regards this republic. With the United
States in possession of two ports it
would not be logical to oppose the seiz
ure of other ports by foreign powers.
At the same time the only hope of
President Mc-rales is that in some way
the United States can secure a post
ponement of.seizure by European pow
ers. No steps to this end have been
initiated here.
President Morales has about 1200
men under arms ready to crush the
first uprising, but should the custom
houses be seized he speedily would be
without funds with which to pay his
army, which would immediately desert.

on Behalf of the United

Believes There Is Nothing

the English Bondholders
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN. March 22.â The note pre
sented by Minister Bowen to the Vene
zuelan Government has not given sat
isfaction here. It is regarded as an at
tempt to go behind the agreement of
England and Germany with Venezuela.
WASHINGTON, March 22.â The
State Department has heard nothing
from Minister Bowen to indicate that
the Venezuelan Government has made
answer to his last proposition to arbi
trate the American claims, and it Is
supposed that the answer, when it does
come, will be to the effect that the
Venezuelan Government insists on
awaiting the final account of Its courts
upon the pending asphalt case. It will
then remain for the State Department
to determine how long it Is prepared to
await this judicial action.
The difficulty is that the Venezuelan
Government has refused the applica
tion of the asphalt company, supported
by Minister Bowen, to revert to the
status existing before the appointment
of a receiver in the asphalt case and al
low the company to repossess Itself of
its property. As it is, the receiver is
taking out large quantities of asphalt
from Bermudez Lake, the proceeds of
which are going into the Venezuelan
treasury, to the great financial loss of
the company, which is making daily
representations on the subject to the
State Department.
The President is concluding arrange
ments for his Southeastern trip, on
which he expects to start on Monday,
April 3, and no apprehension exists that
the trip will be either abandoned or
postponed on account of the Venezue
lan imbroglio. The President expects
in his absence fivm Washington to
keep in close touch with the situation
as it may develop and will be in a posi
tion canstantly to issue such instruc
tions from his train as may be neces
sary.
SITUATION DISCUSSED.
Senator Cullcm, chairman of the For
eign Relations Committee, and Senator
i Lodge, a member uf that committee,
I discussed the Venezuelan , situation
with the President to-day. It is the
â¢ belief here in well-informed quarters
that although the Italian warship Cala
bria is making a cruise around the
' world and stopped Incidentally in Dom
i inican waters, the situation in Vene
â¢ zuela will cause the RoVne Govern
ment to detain the ship in, Caribbean
waters for the present.
While the turn of events has dimin
ished at once the strain u:Â»on the re
lations between France and Venezuela,
it is pointed out here that by reason
of the exclusion of the French claims
from the Velutini arrangement, to be
concluded to-morrow between the Ger
man and British bondholders on the
one side, and Venezuela on the other,
the French Government probably still
will retain a lively interest in that
projected settlement.
Notwithstanding the statement from
London that the bondholders contend
that this settlement, is entirely in ac
cord with the Washington protocol of
1903, the officials here fail to find in
that protocol any warrant for this
agreement, which they regard as likely
to seriously affect the claims of all na
tions other than Great Britain and
Germany against Venezuela, and some
of the foreign representatives here
have cabled this view of the matter
to their Governments.
SURPRISE IX LONDON.
LONDON, March 22.â At the office
! of the counsel of foreign bondholders
,it was stated to-day that an agree
! ment between the Venezuelan Govern
ment and the British and German
bondholders adjusting and consolidat
ing the exterior debtâ s2B,6oo,oo0 â will
be signed to-morrow, the details hav
ing been concluded to the satisfaction
of both parties. It was added that the
guarantees comprise considerably more
than 50 per cent of the customs duties
lof all ports except La Guayra and
: Puerto Cabello. but the officials de
: clined to give the exact figures.
Surprise was expressed at the dis
patches from Washington intimating
that the American Minister at Caracas
i was seeking to prevent the ratification
of the agreement, which the foreign
bondholders contend is entirely in ac-
I cord with the Washington protocol.
I The British and German Foreign Of-
I flees have been consulted and agree
I that the bonds are entirely within
; their rights and the provisions of the
! protocol.
The foreign bondholders have been
| working for a guaranteed payment
1 since the promulgation of the protocol,
first on a scheme which provides for a
1 settlement of the Venezuelan indebted
j ness to all countries, but this plan was.
abandoned by the withdrawal of
France last October. Thereafter the
British and German bondholders united
and secured President Castro's agree
ment to allocate a portion of the reve
nue*! of La Guayra and Puerto Ca
bello, to which Minister Bowen ob
jected. Since this frustration in Jan
uary the bondholders have been at
work on the present agreement, which
provides for the issue of new three
per cent bonds to cover the debt
of the Anglo-German bondholders,
amounting, including arrears, to about
$22,500,000.
CABLE CASE DROPPED.
PARIS, March 22.â The Matin says
Emltassador Jusserand will confer with
President Roosevelt relative to Ven
zuela, and adds: "An ultimatum has
not been sent. President Castro hav
ing taken the case of the French Cable
Company to the courts, France Intends
to leave It there until a decision is
given, when she will be prepared to
adopt all the measures necessary to
secure respect for the rights of French
cltleenÃ."
The French Cable Company has re
ceived a further dispatch from Brun,
its representative at Caracas, confirm
ing the postponement of the decision
of tht court relative to the 1 company's
concefeslon. He says the postpone
ment was sine die. The company's
officials here say the postponement re
sulted from the representations of the
French Minister. It is understood that
QUARREL ENDS
IN A SUICIDE
Antonin Preust, Last Minis
ter of Fine Arts in France,
Falls Out With Actress
TAKES HIS OWN LIFE
Tragedy Results From Differ
ences With Rosita Mauri,
the Celebrated Dancer
PARIS, March 22.â Antonin Preust.
Minister of Fine Arts In the Gambetta
Cabinet, died to-day as the result of
two bullet wounds in the head, self*
inflicted. He had long been a victim
of melancholia, which is believed to
have been intensified recently by dif
ferences with Rosita Mauri, the cele
brated dancer of the Opera, with whom
he was closely associated. She dined
at his apartments on Monday evening,
the tragedy following shortly after her
departure.
Antonin Preust, who was born in
1837, entered journalism in hia youth,
traveled extensively and was the au
thor of a number of works on the fine
arts and travel. He was correspond
ent of the Temps in the Franco-Prus
sian War. After the capitulation of
Sedan he became secretary of Gatn
betti, the cause of whose death has
been shrouded in mystery, but who,
according to one report, died in a man
ner somewhat similar to Preust.
In 1867 Preust was elected to the
Chamber of Deputies and devoted his
attention almost exclusively to foreign
affairs and the fine arts. In 1881 he en
tered the Cabinet presided over by
Gambetta as Minister of Fine Arts,
and retired with the Ministry In 1882,
after which the Ministry of Fine Arts
was suppressed.
In December. 1892, Preust was among
the many deputies compromised In the
great Panama canal scandal, and was
one of the five prosecuted by the Gov
ernment, which caused Preust to re
sign the position of French Commis
sioner General to the Chicago World's
Fair. He was tried before the Assize
Court on the Panama charges and was
acquitted.
Rosita Mauri was at one time the
leading dancer of the Paris Opera and
was at the head of her profession In
the world. When she retired from the
stage in 1898 no dancer was so well
known.

NO ALARM OVER
KAISER'S VISIT
PARIS, March 22.â Emperor Wil
liam's proposed vrsit to Morocco at the
moment when France Is establishing
her paramount Influence there attracts
marked attention and comment. Con
cerning the visit itself, reports to the
effect that France had taken umbrage
.are distinctly denied, as tt is pointed
out that there is nothing incorrect In
such a visit, which is altogether nat
ural during a cruise in the Mediter
ranean.
However, the authorities recognize
that the visit is being used in un
friendly quarters as a pretext to stir
up animosity and excite the Moors to
believe that they should resist the ac
ceptance of the French plan for ad
ministering the country. The officials
here say they do not regard the. Ger
mans as being parties to this ma
neuver, which is attributed mainly to
the Morocco correspondent of a leading
London newspaper. - wing to the
Anglo-French agreement, the authori
ties here expected that British official
and press opinion would assist In the
execution of the French policy. This
policy has now reached a crisis, as the
French mission at Fez is awaiting the
Sultan's final answer. Therefore, the
British press representations that Em
peror William's visit may interrupt the
French policy are strongly disapproved.
Relative to the assertions that Ger
many seeks equality of trade rights in
Morocco, it is said that the Anglo-
French agreement distinctly provides

THi; VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
_____
Few IVople Know How Useful It la
111 Preserving Health and Beauty. â¢
Jvtarly everybody knows that . char-
coal is the *afeet and most' efficient
' disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value "when taken into
th. human system for the samel cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the mom
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
g:a*ep and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
. them out of the system.
. Charcoal sweetens the breath after
. crooking, drinking or after eating
onions and ether odorous vegetables. â 
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic, r
. . It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect In the stomach, and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists . sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the â  finest powdered !
Willow charcoal and other, harmless!
antiseptics in '.tablet form or rather in
the, form of ? large, pleasant -tasting!
lozengers, the charcoal being mixed
with honey. ;^gMME|SS^B^P
The daily use of these lozenge* will
soon tell in a much improved condition
of the' general health, * better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the* beauty . of .it is, that no pos-
sible harm can result from their, con-
tinued use, but on the contrary, great
benefit.
A Buffalo physician In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering, from gas in stomach
Â«nd bowels, and to clear the complex-
: lon and purify the breath, mouth- and
throat; I also believe the liver is great- j
â  ly benefited by the daily use of them; '
they cost but twenty-five cents a box ,
â¢ at , drug stores. and although in some
sense a patent preparation, yet t; I be- j
lieve I get more and .better charcoal in '
\ Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in any
Â»* of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

WANTS TO GO
TO AN ASYLUM
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ENTERPRISE, Or., March 22.âLa
fayette Wright of this town wants to
go to the insane asylum. He has been
to the penitentiary twice for burglary
and doesn't care to go again. He dis
likes the penitentiary because there he
was made to work. He would rather
be adjudged Insane and confined in
the asylum than work in his home
town. He is lazy by nature. For the
past two weeks Wright had been acting:
strangely.
"1 am crazy and want them to send
me to the asylum, but the people here
do not seem to be paying much atten
tion to my case," said he yesterday.
He threatens to do something desper
ate if not sent to the asylum very soon.
His mother says he has not eaten a
mouthful for almost a week, and can't
be prevailed upon to touch food of any
kind. But the authorities do not fear
Lafayette will starve to death. Instead
they consider that he will soon con
clude to work and eat again. Mean
while he is telling every third man
that he is insane.

SCORES ON THE ROAD
Stamiiede Is the Greatest
Known in Alaska Since
the Pedro Creek Discovery
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Wash.. March 22.âFair
banks and Chena have lost their entire
floating population in a stampede to
the Little Delta district, located nearly
100 miles above Fairbanks in Tanana
Valley. New strikes there are making
a better showing than at any creek in
the Fairbanks district. At Tenderfoot
Creek coarse gold running eleven cents
to the pan has been found at a depth
of three feet; at Little Delta it aver
ages ten cents and along Gerstle River
eight cents. Three rival town sites
have been staked, Roosevelt City hav
ing a population already of three hun
dred. Tenderfoot will be another town.
Monday and Tuesday fifty outfits left
Fairbanks for the new diggings, some
of them taking machinery. Not since
the discovery of gold on Pedro Creek
two years ago has there been so much
excitement in Alaska. An unknown
man perished in a storm in Delta dis
trict two weeks ago. Leaving his com
panions he went ahead to find a suit
able place to camp. Soon afterward
Attorney Hill of Nome became ex
hausted and was carried back to a
roadhouse. Next day it stormed so
fiercely that no one could venture from
shelter. In this storm the man un
doubtedly Iperished.

BURGLARS KILL
BUSINESS MAN
SAN BERNARDINO, Mai^h 22.â JW
Shumate, a dry goods merchant, was
shot and killed in his store at Colton
by burglars some time during the early
hour* this morning, his body -
found at 6:30 o clock by a boy who had
entered the store to make a purchase.
Under Shumate's body lay his double
barreled shotgun, with one barrel dis
charged, and a 38-ealiber revolver, with
flyÂ« chambers empty. Shumate had
been sleeping in the store, which had
recently been burglarised, and the in
dications are that he was aroused from
sleep by the burglars as they were
plundering the place. HÂ» had arisen
and discharged his shotgun, when one
of the robbers replied at short range
with a revolver. The bullet entered the
left side of Shumate's head and un
doubtedly caused instant death.
Shumate was last seen alive at 11:30
o'clock last night, when he returned m
thÂ» store from a lodge meeting.
The Coroner's Jury' at Colton to-night
returned a verdict that Shumate cam*
to his death at the hands of persons un
known. One thousand dollars reward
was offered to-night by the citizens of
Colton for the capture and conviction
of the murderer. A half-breed Indian
was arrested to-day as a suspect. Hia
shoes bore fresh blood stains, which h<Â»
explained by saying that he accident
ally cut his hand. A small wound
bears him out. A few days ago Shu
mate told his wife of a man whom he
suspected of trying to rob his store.
She told the officers to-day and they
searched the man's room, but nothing
was found to incriminate him.

OVERTURES FOR PEACE
TO TOKIO GOVERNMENT
France to Act as Intermediary
in Negotiations to End
Far Eastern War.
Russia Will Refuse to Accept Humiliating Terms
ST. PETERSBURG, March 22.â The
party within the Government which is
urging thÂ« EmpÂ«ror to Indicate to
Japan Russia's willingness to end the
Â»ar if a reasonable basis can be
reached, as related in these dispatches
arch 20, has been greatly encour
a?e4 the last few days and an actual
pacific proposal must be just ahead.
The subject has occupied much of the
attention of the conferences at Tsar
ekoe Selo. Certain Grand Dukes, cup-
Bd by General Eakharoff, the Min
ister of War; Admiral Avellan, the
head of thÂ« Admiralty, and what is
krxiwn as trite war party, are still bit
t*rly opposed to the Idea of peace un
c>r present circumstances, but with
the exception of the Ministers of War
and Marine, the Emperor's Ministers,
backed by Witte, solidly favor this
course, and the convincing arguments
they offer are telling.
French influences In the same direc
tion are now being supported by Ger
man opinion. The rumor noted by the
Press laet week that Emperor William
hafi tendered his g-oofi office* now
teems to be confirmed. The Press is
in a position to assert, however, that
if Emperor Nicholas decides to ap
proach Japan it will be through France
and that negotiations â¢will be con
ducted either between Delcasse, the
French Foreign Minister, and Dr.
Montono, the Japanese Minister in
Parte, or Harmand, the French Min
ister to Japan, and Count Katsura, the
Japanese Premier In Tokio.
CZAR MUST MOVE FIRST.
The Russian Government now feels
certain that Japan will not make the
first move nor disclose her position un
til overtures are made authoritatively
B Emperor's name, on the ground
that he alone is capable of binding
Russia. It is quite possible that Ja
attitude In this regard has been
through unofficial attempt* to
ascertain terms. Japan, It will be re-
took the same position
Herr Detrlng, the German Com
ner of Customs at Tientsin, with
out plenary powers, sought to obtain
Japans terms for ending the Chino-
Japanese war. declining to treat until
:ng Chang, accompanied by Gen
eral John W. Foster, went to Tokio
ed with full powers. Further
in view of the possibility that
of agreement might result,
even should the Emperor now approach
Japan with peace proposals, it is re
garded ac entirely likely that hostil-
Trould continue, again following
ihÂ° proceeding of the Chlno-Japanese
war, until negotiations ended.
The Chino-Japanese negotiations
-â¢egun in December afld peace was
-i6e6 in th^ following April. Mean
while the Japanese made a winter cam
paign In Manchuria.
WELL NOT PAY INDEMNITY.
In the conferences concerning the
question whether Russia should now
Indicate her willingness for peace, all
c firstly, that preparations to con
the war shall not be relaxed and,
Ily, to reject humiliating terms.
There probably would be two points
rich Russia would be found lm
bte, namely, cession of territory
and indemnity, to neither of which, it
;s said, would Emperor Nicholas ever
agree.
It Is pointed out, however, that If
Japan seriously desires enduring peace
â¢prai questions, Russia might
idy to offer liberal compensatory
derations. For instance, In lieu of
â  indemnity she might turn over
to Japan the proceeds of the sale of all
the rights and property of the Port
Arthur and Dalny and the Chinese
Eastern Railways and liberally pay for
tne maintenance of Russian prisoners
in Japan and, while refusing to cede
Bagbalien, she might grant rights to
the -fisheries there or even relinquish
a! I the valuable seal fisheries on the
Commander Islands. It Is possible
â¢hat satisfactory arrangements
rr'.pht be made regarding Russian na
rength In Eastern waters for a
I of years.
NEW WARSHIP FOR JAPAN.
Launching of the Kashima at New-
<â â !!< nil T.i ii r
NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, England,
March 22.â The new Japanese battleship
Kashima was launched to-day at the
Els wick shipbuilding yard here in the
re of Baron Hayashi, the Japa
nese Minister to Great Britain.
The Kashima and her sister shifr, the
Katori, being built for Japan at Bar
row-on-Furnese, are of 16,400 tons and
are to have a speed of nineteen knots.
Their main batteries will consist of four
twelve-inch guns, four ten-inch guns

belts will be nine inches thick and they
have superstructures of four-inch
armor, insuring that no part of the
upper worke will be unprotected.

Minister Hayaahi, who reeponded,
said the Japanese success on the sea
was largely due to the fact that more
than a dozen of their great warships
â¢were built in England. He was sorry
the Kashima could not participate in
the war. but the war must end some
time, and thereafter the power of the
vtgsel would be used to maintain peace
in the Far East.
PROVISIONS ARE CHEAP.
Meat Is Now Selling at Ten Cento Per
Pound at Vladivostok.
PORTLAND, Or.. March 22. â Ac
cording to advices brought by the
Portland and Asiatic liner Arabia
from Yokohama, which arrived to
day. It is believed in Yokohama that
Japan will soon attempt to capture
Vladivostok. There are at present
about forty blockade runners in Jap
anese ports of different nationalities,
which have been captured attempting
to enter Russian ports. The crews of
the captured vessels are treated well
by the Japanese and as rapidly as pos
sible sent to their various home ports.
According to blockade runners cap
tured on the return trip from Vladi
vostok, the harbor there Is filled with
vessels loaded with provisions and
coal. The provisions are said to be
cheap, meat being sold for 20 kopeken
(10 cents) per pound. The same im
pression exists in Vladivostok as in
Yokohama, that the Japanese intend
to attack the place In the Immediate
future.
Although there is little credence
placed by the Japanese generally in
the existence of the second and third
Russian Pacific squadron, a fleet of
warships has been sent to intercept
them.
The Arabia found considerable dis
satisfaction among the Japanese over
the strictness of the censorship of
news coming out of Manchuria. The
Japanese complain that they are not
allowed to communicate with their
relatives at the front and are unable
even to ascertain whether they are
living or dead.
HILLOCKS OF CORPSES.
Horrible Slaughter Attends the Cap-

LONDON, March 23. â The corre
spondent at Tokio of the Dally Tele
graph says:
"An officer who has returned from
Mojl describes the terrible fighting
which occurred at the various gates
before the capture of Mukden. He
says that never in the history of war
fare were such formidable field de
fenses faced by Infantry attacks as
the works protecting Mukden.
"The ground became covered with
hillocks of corpses. Three separate
forces attacked the western, southern
and eastern gates. The struggle was
not decided for many hours. Line af
ter line of Japanese infantry went
down. Finally, at 11 o'clock at nicht,
the Russians broke and fled In the
direction of the northern gate. They
suffered enormous losses outside, how
ever, being caught on all sides like
rats in a trap. Altogether 26,000 pris
oners were captured at the southern
and 6000 at the wester ngate."

SLAV ARMY
SEEMS OUT
OF DANGER
Tired Japanese Are
Not Pressing the
Pursuit.
Kuropatkin Returns
to Lead His Old
Command.
GUNSHU PASS. March 22.â The Jap
anese appear to have given the Rus
sians a temporary respite from pursuit,
probably for the purpose of reforming
their forces, as they did after the pur
suit of the Russians north from LÂ»iao
yang. The Russian line runs south
east by northwest, with the right much
nearer the railroad than the left, while
the Japanese position fc/llows a line
intersecting Kaiyuan.
The impression here is that the Jap
anese eastern army Is marching on
Kirin, while the western army is con
tinuing northward between the Mon
golian border and the railway, with the
main line from Harbin westward its
objective; but a period of inactivity is
the likeliest outcome after the great
exertions of the Japanese on the Shak
he. at Mukden and at Tie Pass.
Rumors of a probability that Grand
Duke Nicholas Nicolaievltch will as
sume command of the armies, lately
current at Mukden, have been revived
here during the past few days, and are
continuing in spite of the nomination
of Linevitch.
Little or nothing is known here of the
happenings in the outside world, since
the army is now cut off from all com
munication by way of China, but all
are intensely interested in the renewed
rumors of peace discussions.
RETIRX OF KUROPATKIN.
GUNSHU PASS, Tuesday. March 21.
The correspondent of the Associated
Iress after the removal of the Russian
headquarters from Tie Pass, remained
with the rear guard, being some days
without telegraphic facilities.
Extensive preparations to carry out
the plan of retreat were made by Gen
erals Kuropatkin, Linevitch, Bllderlmg
and Kaulbars and were successfully
carried out.
On March 19, Kuropatkin, considering
that the army was safe, departed for
Harbin, but having subsequently been
directed to remain as commander of the
First army, he returned here to-day,
receiving a great ovation at the. rail
road station and acknowledging the
cheers with a short speech, in which he
expressed the hope that the army
would soon be able to retrieve its re
verses.
It is too early to determine the ef
fect of the change in the supreme com
mand, but private soldiers have con
fidence in , the venerable Linevitch,
whose task is monumental. The re
organization effected at Tie Pass after
the retreat from Mukden incontestably
marked the end of the second stage of
the war.
Gunshu Pass, which has a large rail
road station and Red Cross settlement
with all army facilities, is now an enor
mous camp, 'overflowing the native
hamlet In all directions. Troops are
arriving daily. The advance divisions
are continuing their march northward,
while some fresh troops from Euro
pean-Russia are coming south to re
lieve the wornout rear guard. The
booming of guns on the right flank
was heard all morning.
PURSUIT LACKS STRENGTH.
GUNSHU PASS, Manchuria, Mon
day, March 20.â The Russian rear
guard is now at Sipinghai, seventy
miles north of Tie Pass. The Jap
anese are slowly pursuing, but are not
energetically pressing the rear. Ap
parently Field Marshal Oyama is
holding his main army at Tie Pass.
When the Russians evacuated Tie
Pass on March 15 one span of the five
span bridge over the Tehal River,
which flows into the Llao River Just
north of the town, was destroyed by
dynamite immediately after thÂ« last
train had been dispatched northward,
and as the army moved northward the
bridges of the railroad were disabled
and everything in the shape of stores,
etc., which could not be taken was
burned.
Some desultory artillery fire was
heard on the extreme right as the re
treat progressed, but the Japanese ap
peared to be indecisive. Their pursuit
lacked strength In spite of four days'
rest at Tie Pass, which gave the Rus
sians a chance to reform after the
hardships they had suffered and they
took up the march In orderly fashion,
pressing forward, however, at such a
pace that many horses and cattle in
the transport-train were exhausted and
left dying by the roadside. Like an
endless serpent the army trailed over
the vast rolling country, moving along
during the day over a half-dozen me
andering roads parallel with the rail
road. At night the neighboring hill
sides were lighted by dead grass ig
nited by the camp fires.
Thirty miles was covered the first
day, Kaiyuan being left behind on
March 16. The rear guard evacuated
Changtufu on March 19.
Dispatch riders report that General
Madridoff, in command of an Irregular
force in the mountains far eastward,
found himself cut off before he got
news of the great battle of Mukden,
and was compelled to retire northeast,
probably making his way toward
Kirin.
ARMY BELIEVED TO BE SAFE.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 22.â The
retreat of the Russian army, from the
latest reports, evidently is being con
durted in a splendid fashion. Tn four
days actual marching after leaving Tie
Pass the rear guard has fallen back
seventy miles and the heads of the col
umns are already entering Gunshu
Pass, forty miles farther north, keep
ing up with the Japanese column
marching north over the Grand Trade
route. With the bridges and railroad
destroyed behind the Russians, the
Japanese are unable to press the rear,
and, according to information received
from the front, it is believed that the
bulk of Field Marshal Oyama's army
is still at Tie Pass, the flanking column
beins; comparatively weak. This news
may. however, prove incorrect.
For two days there has been some

ST. PETERSBURG, March 23. â In
connection with the peasant revolt
there have been 500 arrests in the
Dvinsk district, where, besides sack
ing and burning property and com
pelling the owners to seek refuge in
the towns, the rioters are killing cat
tle and felling trees.
In the Kieff district it is reported
that forged documents have reached
the local authorities, ordering the sale
of state lands to peasants at absurdly
low prices. These documents are be
lieved to have been circulated by rev

advance to Kirin would be equivalent
to the Isolation of Vladivostok.
RUSSIA'S NAVAL PROGRAMME.
American Sliipbuilders Will Hare
Large Share of Contracts.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 23.â The
prospects of American shipbuilders
having a large share In the rebuilding
and enlargement of the Russian navy
are growing brighter. An extensive
naval programme, which in a few years
will restore Russia to an equality to
the first-class sea powers, has been
practically completed, but has not yet
received the final assent of Emperor
Nicholas.
The policy of the Admiralty will be
to use the rebuilding of the navy for
the development of the shipbuilding in
dustry at home. In order to render
the country Independent of foreign con
struction In future. At the same time
it is reilazed that, on account of the
extent of the programme, it will be im
possible to construct all the ships in
Russia without entailing too much de
lay.
All the foreign shipbuilding interests
are enlisted in the rivalry. The Ad
miralty is inclined to show especial
consideration to the claims of Russia's
French allies, but American proposi
tions also are regarded with favor,
and when the orders are distributed,
America, next to France, is likely to
get the largest share, since there is
reason to believe that American enter
prise may also undertake the construc
tion of a great shipbuilding plant at
some port of the Baltic or on the Gulf
of Finland.
On account of anti-British sentiment
the propositions of British shipbuilders
are receiving scant consideration.
POEM ON RUSSIAN CRISIS.
George Meredith's Appeal to the Spirit
of the Fatherland.
LONDON, March 23. â George Mere
dith contributes to the Times a poem
entitled "The Crisis," and beginning:
Spirit of Russia, now has come
ThÂ» day when thou canst not bÂ« dumb.
In which, after eloquently painting
the perils surrounding the empire, the
poet thus addresses the spirit of Rus
sia:
Those who bind
Thy limbs and lroncap thy mind
Take the* for quaking flesh, mladoubt
That thcu art of the rabble rout
Which cries and flees with whimpering lip
From reckless sun and brutal whip.
But he who has at heart the deeds
Of thy heroic ofTsprinjj reads
In them a soul not eiven to shrink
From peril on the abyss' brink.
The poem concludes:
Give to thy sons a breathing breast.
Ami Him resembllne. in His sight.
Say to thy land. "L*t there be light."

MORGAN A DUPE
MILWAUKEE. Wis., March 22.â
What is pronounced by a New York
connoisseur to be a genuine Gainsbor
ough picture is in possession of a Mil
waukeean. If it Is an original, the
picture for which J. Pierpont Morgan
paid a fancy price must be an imita
tion. t
The old canvas has an interesting
history. It is a portrait of King Louis
XIV of France. Evidently it was
painted at about the same period as
rHe famous picture bought by Morgan.
The artist's name was worn away. The
canvas was bought by a Milwaukeean
thirty-three year? ago for a small price
from an old French immigrant. Ac
cording to the story of the Frenchman
the picture was cut from Us frame
during the French revolution and
passed from hand to hand through the
Canadian provinces until It rfached

GREENE-GAYNOR
CASE DELAYED
MONTREAL, March 22.â The appli
cation for a writ of prohibition on the
ground that Extradition Commissioner
La Fontaine was not qualified to hear
the Gaynor-Greena case was dismissed
by Justice Davidson to-day and the
case will now be tried on ifs merits by
Judge La Fontaine. Gaynor and
Greene are wanted by the United
States Government for alleged frauds
in connection with the Improvement of
the Savannah harbor.
The attorneys for Gaynor and Greene
have appealed from Judge Davidson's
decision. This will postpone the extra
dition trial for a long time, as It will
have to come before the full bench of
the Appeal Court of the King's Bench.
Another protest on entirely new
grounds also has been entered against
Judge La Fontaine acting In the case.

HARGIS PLANS
FIVE MURDERS
LEXINGTON, Ky., March 22.â Dr.
Cox, James Cockrill, Mark Cockrill.
Attorney Vaughn and Marcum were to
have been shot by Anderson White in
the courthouse during the trial of
Thomas Cockrill for the murder of Ben
jamin Hargis, in obedience to orders
given by James Hargis, according to a
sensational story told to-day by White
in th" hearing of the motion for ball
for the Hargises and Callahan.
Anderson White is the brother of
Thomas White, who is under life sen
tence for the murder of J. B. Marcum.
White said that prior to the killing of
Cocknll James Hargis took him to the
Hargis store, gave him a pistol and
told him he wanted him to return to
the courthouse, where the trial of
Thomas Cockrill was In progress, and
be ready to do as Judge Hargis told
him. He declared that Hargis wanted
him to shoot five men, White being
ordered to shoot in the event that any
trouble occurred.
"Kill all of these or any damned one
of them," is what White said Hargis
told him to do. He said he declined to
do this and ret ---ned the pistol.
HUNGARY STILL
LACKS CABINET
BUDAPEST, Hungary, March 22.â
Julius Andrassy, the former Premier,
has failed to solve the ministerial
problem. He had an audience with the
Emperor to-day at which he relin
quished the task of attempting to form
a new Cabinet.
At a meeting to-day of the opposition
group, a resolution was adopted to the
effect that It was impossible to form a
Cabinet from the ranks of the com
bined opposition, or even support such
a Cabinet if formed, because of. the at
titude of the crown, which would only
approve a ministry from whose pro
gramme the questions of Hun
garian colors and Hungarian words
of command in the army were
eliminated. The resolution also af
firmed that the demand of the crown
for the conclusion of a financial agree
ment with the Austrian Government
and an unconditional ratification of the
commercial treaty with Germany could
not be accepted as it would prevent
the realization of the economic inde
pendence of the Hungarian Govern
ment. The meeting, therefore, declared
that the coalition of the opposition
groups could not support any Cabinet
constituted on such a Jtesis and was
resolved to maintain unaltered the sol
idarity of the coalition during the pres
ent serious crisis.
A vote of thanks was given Julius
Andraspy for his efforts In behalf of the
groups.
Sues Pacific Union Club.
The Johnson Service Company filed
suit yesterday against the Pacific
Union Club for a judgment declaring
a lien against the club's property for
$1260. the price of a ventilating srys
tem installed In its new building at
Post and Stockton streets. In addi
tion to judgment for this amount the
plaintiff asks for $2 50 for recording
fees and $300 attorneys' fees. In an
other suit the Johnson Service Com
pany asks for $2234 for plumbing
work done.

COMMONS HITS
AT PROTECTION
LONDON, Marrh 22.- As a result
of the Cabinet's decision yesterday to
use no pressure upon its followers in
regard to resolutions introduced by
the opposition to commit the Gov
ernment on the fiscal uuestion, a reso
lution introduced at to-night's seÂ»Â»
sion of the House of Commons by
John Stirling Ainsworth (Free Trade
Liberal) was carried by a vote of 254
to 2. The resolution declares that "in,
the opinion of the House the imposi
tion of a general duty on all manu
factured goods imported from abroad,
not exceeding 10 per cent on an aver
age and varying according to the
amount of labor on these goods,
would be injurious to the commercial
interests of the United Kinf/dom."
While the action of the Cabinet yes
terday left no opening for a critical
party division, the decision of the
Government to evade an issue on the
fiscal question for the remainder of
the session and the fact that this was
the first go-as-you-please vote brought
out a large attendance and good s^l
leries.
A strong Liberal whip summoned
the members of the opposition, and
the Nationalists turned out tn full
force.
Premier Balfour spoke briefly, ex-
plaining that he did not consider the
resolution as anything more than an
abortive effort on the part of the op
position to embarrass the Government
over nn issue which was not before
Parliament. He recommended his fol
lowers not only to follow the policy
he had adopted by not debating th*Â»
resolution, but also to follow his ex
ample by not going into the division
lobby.
Lord Hugh Cecil said he believed
that after to-night the country would
not take the tariff reformers seriously.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
SHERIFFS OF TWO COUNTIES
SEARCHING FOR ROBBERS
Bending Efforts to
Locate Buggy of
Highwaymen.
Hints of a Hold-Up
Given by Convict
in Richmond.
OAKLAND. March 22 âSheriff Veale
of rontra Costa <v.unty ha? settled
doÂ»n to a hard dig for the hrace of
highwaymen wh<> hHci up John E- Daly
and Frank K. Roche at Stege crossing
Mo>-^ay morning and stole $10,000 in
transit from the Central Bank to the
Bank of Richmond to meet the Pacific
Coast Oil Company's payrolL Sheriff
Baroett of Alameda County Is equally
busy In the work. The Oakland police
are lending a hand and the Central
Bark officials are likewise in the line
of pursuit with Pinkerton detectives.
Many theories that have been ad
vanced concerning the robbery have
been worked out and disposed of.
Clews have been run down and leads
have vanished under close investiga
tion. . The most satisfactory informa
tion that has reached the authorities
since they began work on the robbery
Is that contained in the narrative of
Miss Mai I*'!1 *'! Perry, who from her home
at Assemblyman Harry Ells' residence
at Stege saw the operations of the rob
bers as she gazed through a pair of
field glasses. Her statement furnishes
important corroborative evidence as to
the crime, and best of all. Miss Perry,
in the event the highwaymen are cap
tured, will be able to testify as to their
Identity, so closely did she note their
movements.
GLASSES ARK TESTED.
Tests were made to-day at the Ells
residence of the glasses Miss Perry
used. The examination was most sat
isfactory, fully bearing out th<? young
woman's story as to the <iÂ« j riiiiieness
of her view of the men. The lenses
brought objects at the scene of '.he rob-
bery so near that there was no trou
ble in making out with, distinctness
everything la the sweep of the glasses.
Mips Pen . repeated her story to-day
and explained in more detail how she
became the witness in so remarkable
a way to the robbery.
Her reluctance to make it public was
understood and appreciated 'oy Sheriff
VeaJe. who said he had made sufficient
investigation to confirm thoroughly his
belief la its truth. The Sheriff added:
"After I- had been sent for by As
semblyman Ells on this matter, 1 made
a careful investigation of the surround
ings to satisfy myself that Miss Perry
could have seen everything at the
crossing, as she explained. * 1 tried the
field glasses and saw for myself that
without any difficulty Miss Perry could
have made the observations she says
she did make.
"It was a bit unfortunate that there
were no men folks at the Ells place at
the time to advise with Miss Perry and
her mother as to what they should do.
If the women had appreciated at the
instant what was occurring the chances
are they would have given an alarm
that would have led to the robbers'
capture.
VEALS VISITS SAN FRA.NCISCO.
'Miss Perry's recital so fully bears
out both Daly and Roche that I have
eliminated completely any doubt that
might have arisen at the outset of this
caae as to the entire truth of their
statements. So far as Daly and Roche
are concerned I have at no time made
a statement or a comment that could
be construed as affecting their status
in the case. But in a robbery of this
character it is merely a matter of
clean-cut police work to give attention
to every possibility until one has been
aatisfied either of its truth or its
falsity."
In connection with the Richmond
end of the robbery comes a story that
two months ago C. Henry told H.
Fitraimmons in a saloon at that town
that a big haul of Oakland money
was shortly to be made by "two guys."
Henry *aa sentenced last Friday in
San Francisco to fourteen years' im
prisonment at Folsom penitentiary.
The authorities are investigating the
story to ascertain whether Henry will
connect any two men with the possi
bility of b^ing implicated in the rob
bery.
Fitwimmons. who is a saloon
keeper at Richmond, denies that Hen
ry ever spoke to him concerning plans
of robbery. He knows Henry, who
had worked at the oii plant. Henry
is in jail in San Francisco.
Story after story of possible identi
ties of the robbers has bepn passed to
Barnot. to th<- bank people, to the po
lice, to Daly, in fact to every one who
has gained public attention as directly
engaged on the cast. Humors of men
having told of big hauls shortly to be
made are current gossip in police cir
< lee. Km with the most painstaking
I every one of the stories is run
down. Much of the work of the au- j
thorities has been directed to the hunt !
for the missing buggy, the one which '
was seen by Daly on Railroad avenue,
and was traced as far as the county
line on the trip toward Berkeley by
the fleeine robbers. Every effort to
date has failed t<> uncover the mvste
riouf bugpy. That to a great extent
Sheriff Veale admits, holds the key to
the case. The buggy was probably
driven as far as the corner of Hopkins
Ftreet and San Pablo avenue, if not aa
far as Hopkins Junction with Sacra
mentn>t far from where Dalv's
buggy was recovered. P. G. Anderson
b West Berkeley expressman, found to
day a black slouch hat lying on the
roadside on Sacramento street, some
distance north of the place where the
Daly rig was standing. The hat was
â wide-brimmed, high crowned and in
â¢-*] appearance answers the de
scription of the hat which was worn
by the Ftout robber who attended to
"Roche. This hat was shown to Dalv
ana 1 to Roche. Both agreed that it
fitted the description of the hiehwpv
mans hat. They were not willlnr to
make a positive identification, but were
satisfied with its appearance.
HAT IS .KTRITTMZFD.
The hat wa* size 7%. with a United
Halt. iation label in the inside
It wtif. devoid of special marks of iden
tification. In general It was such a
hat ao 1s worn by sw.< kmen and min
ing men in the West. The style is
â¢al of the cattle and mining Voun-
The surmise if that the robber dur
ing his fast drive lost the hat by hav
inp it blown off his head. In his
hurry to get away he did not attempt
Â»<-. recover the hat.

took charge of this bit of evidence to
use for what it might be worth.
Sheriff Veale has offered a reward
of 1250 for the arrest and conviction
of the robbers and the recovery of the
money. The Central Bank officials
have not taken action as yet concern
ing a reward. Neither the Bank of
Richmond nor the Pacific Coast Oil
Company will offer rewards.
W. G. Palmanteer, vice president of
the Central Bank, said to-night: "I am
satisfied that the officers are working
much in the dark at this time. Al
though I believe the men will eventu
ally be arrested, I do not think their
capture will be made on any clews so
far developed. The bank directors will
offer a reward in due time."
COURT SAYS MRS. HARRIETS
STATEMENTS ARE UNTRUE
Judge Ellsworth Grants Husband a
Divorce and Gives Custody of
Daughter to Him.
OAKI^AXD, March 22. â An inter
locutory decree of divorce on the
ground of desertion was granted
Alexander Barrie of Berkeley from
Eliza A. Barrpj this afternoon, and
the troubles of this couple, which
have been aired in the courts in one
form or another for two years, have
gone beyond the public ear. One ef
fect of the reiteration of charges of
immorality in her household made by
Mrs. Barrie has been the utter alien
ation from her of her daughter, Ade
laide, who stated to Judge Ellsworth
in chambers that she wanted nothing
more to do with her mother, as she
feels she has been disgraced by the
charges made by her.
In summing up the evidence In the
caae prior to rendering his decision.
Judge Ellsworth said the charges
made by Mrs. Barrie are not support
ed by the evidence and are without
foundation.
Barrie was given the custody of the
daughter, who Is within a few months
of her majority. The wife was giv
en $50 a month alimony and the
household effects were divided be
tween them.
DO NOT BELIEVE HIS
CONFESSION OF MURDER
Officials Say Bail Bodin Could Not
Have Thrown Body Into River
Without it.M Being Found.
OAKLAND, March 22. â A dispatch
from Bangor, Me., to-day throws dis
credit on the story told by Earl Bodin,
who a few days ago confessed to
having committed murder. Bodin
made the confession to Evangelist
McComb and then to the police.
The dispatch says that the story of
Bodin is "absolutely not credited by
Maine officials. Sheriff Martin Law
less of Aroostook County says to-day
that he does not believe that such a
crime was ever committed in the
county. He said that a body thrown
into the Aroostook River would cer
tainly have been found.
Judge Nicholas Fessenden of Fort
Fairfleld. who has lived there many
years, says that no such occurrence
could have happened there. Investi
gation in Aroostook has failed to re
veal anything to support the alleged
confession.

SOCIETY GIRL
DECIDES UPON
STAGE CAREER
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND. March 22.â Two Oakland girls
will divide public attention to-morrow night.
While Caro Koma. who has already won dis
tii.ctlon In the musical -world. Is bidding fare
v.-ell in San Francisco to California audiences.
Pearl King, who has eschewed society for the
stage, will make her debut at the Macdonough
as a professional. Miss King is the daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. King and their
mansion In East Oakland has been the scene
ol many brilliant functions, notably the com
ing-out ball of the young lady who makes
her. first professional appearance to-morrow
night. The Kings have always been most
Hospitable entertainers and the fine character
and unaffected sincerity of their eldest daugh
ter has endeared her to a host of friends, who
are planning to give her a rousing reception.
Hortense NellÃon with whom Miss King
wil! appear In "Cleopatra," is also a Cali
fornia Klrl. I believe. At any rate she is a
sister of Alice Nellson, the famous little opera
Btnger. and in her own line v talented, they
say.
Numbers of theater parties are being formed
to witness Miss King's debut, the largest be
ing the eighty participants In the recent pro
duction of "Pinafore."
The wonderrul success of the opera, which
was given by amateur talent, was mainly due
to the efforts of Miss Ktng, who. as stage
director, positively slaved for 'weeks betore.
The excellence oÂ£ the performance was not
only a proof o( the ability of those in thÂ«
cast, but a tribute of their high esteem for
their stage director, for all had determined
to do their beat "for Miss King's sake."
Across the bay Caro Roma's farewell con
cert will probably bring together an equally
enthusiastic crowd, for thp well-known singer
has many admirers, and besides assisting her
will be some of the most noted artists in
San Francisco.
ThÂ« ladies of the Oakland Club and their
friends enoyed an unusually pleasant aftÂ«r
noon of music to-day, the event belns a
flower song recital by pupils of Mrs. Jessie
Dean Moore of San Francisco. Mrs. Moore
Is quite well known here. Several years ago
she was leader of a little musical club that
met at the home of the Dunns and of which
Dr. J. ,P. H. Dunn's sisters were moving
spirits.
Two young Oakland girls participated in
the programme. Miss Grace Porter and Miss
Alta Countryman, and their teacher may well
be proud of them both. Miss Porter has been
studying only a year, but has a remarkably
sweet voice that is unusually promising
The entire programme was am follows:
Part song, "Sweet Daisy" (Curshman); duet.
"Lily of the Valley" (Plnsutl), Mra J. B
Tallman and Mrs. O. B. Culver; solo (a)
"Dandelion" (Chadwiok), (b) "Violets" (Wood
man). Miss Edna Riehl of San Francisco- solo
"The Flower Song" (Bevignanl) Mies Gract
Pc-rtÂ«r of Oakland; song cycle. "Rose Songs"
(Jessie L. Gaynor), Miss Ruby A. Moore of
San Francisco; "Rongs From an Old Garden "

low daisy, the blue bell) (Edward MacDowell)
Miss Alta Countryman of Oakland; barytone
solo. "The Red Red Rose" (Hastings). Dele
van Bowley of San Francisco; part song, "The
Alpine Rose" (Gerrlt Smith).
Mrs. E. F. Cole was chairman of the after
noon and was assisted by Mrs. W. W. Stande
ford. Mrs. W, M. Kleeman, Mrs. Oscar Lun
nlng, Mrs. W. U Palmer Mrs. H. B Mehr

At an informal tea given by Mrs. Zeno
Mauvals recently the engagement of Edythe
Tumor Chlsholm and Frederick LeÂ« Wolfe
was announced. The bride-to-be, who Is an
unusually attractive young woman Is the
dnughtÂ»r of Mrs. Helen Tumor and 'a slstei
of Mrs. Paul Carroll of this city. Mrs. Tum
or and Mrs. Mauvais are old schoolmates
end lifelong friends and she has always re
garded Mrs. Chisholm in the light of a near
relative, so to her was given the pleasure
of being the first to announce the happy
tidings. Mr. Wolfe Is a successful business
man of San Francisco and a Bank Commis
sioner.
Preparations for the wedding are progressing

L'l4B Center street, March 22.
The case of Louis E. Bulkeley." has
been ended, and the judgment Against
him is -.expulsion""; from the University
of California. The Academic Council
held : its examination into his case this
morning and at the' conclusion", the fol
lowing findings were made: â¢'
To the faculty of the College of Social Sci
ences: The academic council 'reports to the
faculty of the College of social' Sciences that
Louis B. Uulkeley has personally appeared be
fore the committee .on student affairs, all
members of the committee being present.' After
hearing the committee's â  report it |Is unani
rt.ously mmended by the academic -council
that Louis E. Hulkeley be expelled from the
University of California, the expulsion to tak<i
effect Immediately; . â¢-' ' . â  .
At 11 o'clock this morning the time
expired during which Bulkeley was to
be permitted to appear before thf uni
versity authorities and show cause
why he should not be "expelled for
discreditable conduit. "
Bulkeley, it was thought by many,
would never appear before the col
legiate master?, but would resign and
withdraw quietiy from thr sphere of
university activities where he was
formerly so prominent. He chose, how
ever, to make a stand before the uni
versity professors and to plead In his
own behalf. He declared that he was
not guilty of the offense credited to
him by Corinne Barry, whom he was
forced to wed a fortnight agn.
Bulkeley left town this morning after
declaring to his former college inti
mates that he had been "gmssly
wronged."
In a bulletin issued by the university
authorities to-day it was stated that
"Ted" Rust, formerly one of Bulkeley's
assistants in the spectacular post of
yell leader, will succeed Bulkeley and
make his first appearance as the yell
leader of the university at the meeting
on Friday morning.
MAY DISCOVER
ANOTHER WORLD
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, March 22.
A problem that long has vexed as
tronomers may be settled during the
next eclipse of the sun on August SO.
1905, according to the declaration of
Director Campbell of the Lick Ob
servatory, made to university students
in his lecture to-day before Professor
Leuschner's class. The question
which it is hoped will be answered- as
a result of the sun's eclipse is whether
the planet Mercury is the nearest of
the sun's neighbors, or whether there
exists one or more smaller planets re
volving within the Mercurial orbit.
Director Campbell says that the ap
proaching eclipse will offar the best
opportunity to be had for at least a
generation for studying this and
other important astronomical prob
lems.
Director Campbell explains that the
orbit of Mercury has been found sub
ject to disturbances which are ac
counted for on the supposition that
there are one or more intra-Mercurlal
planets. The astronomer says:
Such Dlanets, if they do exist, would only
be visible In a darkened sky supplied by a to
tal eclÂ»pÂ»e of the sun. The recent application
of photographic methods to astronomy has
greatly Increased the efficiency of 'hose who
search the heavens in this manner. A photo
graph ot the portion of the sky where the
eclipce will take place ls> to be secured sev
eral months in advance. This photograph will
then be compared, section by section, with a
elimlar photograph taken at the Instant of
the eclipse. New bodies that appear on th*
second plate, if not due to defects of the plate
Itself, mv.st reDreaeat intra-Mercurlal bedies.
The use of duplicate plates should be a safe
guard against defects.
The most successful attempt to obtain pho
tographs of this sort was made by Professor
Perrlne In 191)1. The sky was cloudy then
and he could cover only two-thirds of the,
necessary area, and hence he tailed to prove
that an Inter-Mercurial b< dy exlatÃ. The search
at the coming eclipse will be continued under
favorable conditions. Recent Improvements in
astronomical photography will enable observ
ers to detect any body thirty miles cr more
in diameter. Stations for the study of thÂ«s
eclipse are to be arranged In Labrador, Spain
and Tunis.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. March 22.
Ignited States Senator George C
Perkins arrived from Washington
this evening. California was as beau
tiful to him as ever, and never so
welcome. On the summit of the Sier
ras this morning he said there was
ten feet of snow and as the train came
down the mountains they ran from
snowbound mountain tops into val
leys of flowers.
In speaking of California's interests
nt the nation's capital he said in re
gard to the regulation of interstate
commerce that when the Interstate
Commerce Commission is reorganized
President Roosevelt has promised him
California shall be represented. "This
State," he said, "is the terminal of the
grp.it roads and there never has been

pouri River. We ar^ so vitally interest
â¢Â»<! in this matter that I have urged it
upon the President and when the
body is again reorganized we will get
a man there to represent us."
Senator Perkins' remarks went nat
urally to what had been donÂ» by Con
gress for the State he represents, and
in this connection he made an ex
haustive showing of the financial help
this coast has received during the
last session.
His showing is in part as follows:

project No. & This assure* a channel 25 feet
deep and 000 feeet wide from the bay to
Fallon street.
Congress has also, for the improvement or
thÂ« Sacramento and Feather rivers, authorised
the expenditure of the balance of the fund
remaining to the credit of the Sacramento
and Feather River projects for the mainte
nance of navigation. Including snagging, and.
If necessary, the purchase or construction of
another snagboat.
The Secretary of War is alÂ»o authorised to

SCULPTURE AT BOHEMIAN CLUB
Young At t ken Shows Power and Originality
PHOTOGRAPH OF THE BUST OF "UNCLE" GEORGE BROMLEY, WITH "UNCUT 1 GEORGE ALONGSIDE IN THE FI KSH
ILLUSTRATING THE MARVELOUS LIKENESS OF THE PORTRAIT TO THE WF.LL-BELOVED CLUBMAN THE CLEVER
YOUNG SCULPTOR APPEARS ON THE RIGHT IN HIS STUDIO IN FULL DREf-S. X
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
Over at the Bohemian Clvb â the good
godparent of Western art â Robert I.
Aitken ("Bobby" cm occasions of lesser
dignity) is showing to his townsfolk
the product of his brain, his heart and
his sensitive, nimble fingers.
Yesterday afternoon the elevator â
which moves with well-bred delibera
tion â bore loads of femininity and as
many men to the jinks room above,
there to look upon the work of this
lad-of-a-few-years-since.
And. fellow citizens, yesterday mark
ed the first dignified exhibition of
sculpture in this Western burgâ where
sculpture was the thing, not a back
ground to the thing, and where every
piece was allotted its full valuation.
And for this let us sing hosannahs: â
for San Francisco has to-day awakened
to the fact that sculpture is art and
that Robert Aitken's â much of it â is
high art.
Around the room, forming a fetching
background for the fluted white col
umns bearing their burden of art, is a
dado of fir and pine, pungent with the
odors of the forest, while overhead is a
latticed canopy of green â a fit setting
for some of the most virile work that
has yet come out of the West.
"Virile?" Yes â and masterful, ex
pressive of the highest nights of the
human soul â and the deepest deeps;
sacrificing at times the cold facts of
anatomy for continuity's sake â for the
sake of dramatics; but of his own
work, the work that germinated under
that shock of black hair, is this true.
And because of it this is the work by
which the young sculptor should be
measured, rather than that which he
does, as it were, "according to plans
and specifications." And yet this, too,
holde its own high merit, as Is evident
in the McKinley monument model, the
Hall McAllister and others, but they
lack the dominant element in the lad's
characteristic work â that of intensity
of emotion.
And it is through this all-powerful
medium, good friends, that this young
Bohemian will some day make the
world know his name â and it will!
Among the notable groups that show
his splendid emotional power are "The
Flame," "The Family," "The Release
of Soul," "The End of the Journey,"
"Mutual Sorrow," "Self-Conquered,"
"The Clutch of Destiny," "The Curse
of Beauty" and "The First Sorrow."
And of these strong things, some of
the noblest are of his earliest work,
notably the two last. And while lack
ing somewhat the finesse of his later
work by bearing unnecessary detail,
the same ideals of po3e and continuity
of line are there almost without varia
tion.
"Bless Uncle George Bromley's
heart!" say the ladies that stand be
fore his portrait of clay. Bless him,
indeed, for the Joy he radiates even
from his bust of clay! â so near to the
real Uncle George as to be almost un
canny, as witneaseth in the photo
graph.
For this exhibit of what a young
Californian can do we are duly grate
ful to the Blinking Owl.
And to the clever young artist we
drink to his future â for the world
shall know him as a man who FEELS
and who knows how to express it
through his medium of clay. And on
that score he must win, since it is the
oNy gateway to fame, even as It is
with the poet and the painter.
Thp exhibition will be open to those
who hold cards next Saturday after
noon and on the Saturday succeeding.
MAID AND MATRON ATTEND
THE "QUIET DAY" SERVICES
Rev. J. Wilmer Gresham of San Jose
Conduct* Solemn Devotions at
St. Luke's.
"Quiet day" was observed yester
day morning and afternoon at St
Luke's Church, Van Ness avenue, with
solemnity and deep devotion by maid
and matron. T*he service was con
ducted by the Rev. J. Wilmer Gresh
am, rector of Trinity Church.San Jose.
Bishop Nichols celebrated the holy
eucharist and gave the Woman's Aux
iliary, under whose auspices the ser
vices were held, solemn admonition
as to their duty of prayer and ser
vice. The Rev. Burr M. Weeden, rec
tor of St. Luke's, also took part In the
devotional exercises. The tonics treat
ed by Mr. Gresham were: "Following
the Master," "The Outer Life and
Some of Its RelationshiDS," "The In
ner Life and Its Completeness," "Per
ils and Safeguards of the Inner Life"
and 'The Relation of the Means to
the End In the Pursuit of Divine
Ideals."
It was in the final address that Mr.
Gresham felt impelled to remark that
when some ministers see empty pews,
in the goodness of their purpose to fill
their churches they resort to sensa
tion, to advertiFing and to current
topics and make music attractive in
stead of the gospel.
The treatment of the subjects was
masterly and brilliantly and lucidly
explanatory.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1905.
NO JAPANESE
NEED APPLY
In refusing the application of a Jap
anese for a license to conduct a res
taurant with privilege to sell liquor
with meals. President Poheim an
nounced his intention last night at the
meeting of the Police Commission to
refuse all applications of Japanese
hereafter. He said that he had read
many protests in the papers lately re
garding the number of Japanese re
ceiving licenses, and that tou many of
them were in the business to the ex
clusion of the whites.
Commissioner Reagan suggested that
a report from acting Chief Splllane be
awaited before definite action be taken.
All Japanese applications, therefore,
were postponed one week to await the
acting Chief's report. Reagan agreed
with Poheim that the Japs were too
numerous, at least in some parts of the
city, and favored some action. Drink
house remained silent.
In a report of two closely typewrit
ten pages, involving much detail, Cap
tain Thomas S. Duke indignantly re
futes Judge Fritz's charge that the
police are lax in suppressing pool sell-
Ing or inefficient in that work. He
says that the work of the police is nul
lified by the action of Police Court
Judges in discharging almost every
man brought before them by police
men. Fritz has the record for dis
charges, the report says. Out of forty
two pool-selling cases in his court
there has been but one sentence, it
says.
Duke says that out of 229 cases of
pool buying and selling, there have
been only two convictions; 157 have
been dismissed and seventy are still
pending. All kinds of devices and dis
guises have been used by patrolmen,
but the pool sellers are familiar with
the faces of their patrons and arrests
are difficult to make. The report was
ordered filed and a copy sent to Judge
Fritz.
The sentences of Police Sergeant El
lis and his Chinatown squad were post
poned until Friday night, at which
time the trial of the suspended Chief
of Police, George W. Wittman, will be
ri^umed.
The board first took up the theater
situation and upon the resolution of
Commissioner Reagan agreed to post
pone the matter to next Monday night,
in order to give the Police Board an
opportunity to prepare reports relative
to the existing conditions of the the
aters.
Thirteen Chinatown guides appeared
before the Commissioners for a renewal
of their licenses, which were granted.
In renewing the same, Commissioner
Reagan said that at some time in the
near future the board would take up
an investigation of the Chinatown
guide system and effect reorganization.
URGES EXPORTERS TO MAKE
MORE DIRECT CONNECTIONS
Pacific Commercial Museum Reports
Interesting FactÂ« Concerning the
Dried Fruit Trade.
Secretary Evans of the Pacific Com
mercial Museum has issued a circular
in which he calls attention to the ad
visability of establishing more direct
communication connections with Brit
ish and European colonial, possessions
on the part of California exporters of
canned and dried fruits. This in
cludes prupes and evaporated fruits.
In part the circular is as follows:
It appears from the reports to hand that thÂ«
reason, why a larger direct business Is not
done Up* chiefly In the fact that importers In
the colonies re accustomed to purchase' their
supplies through their London. * Liverpool or
Hamburg 1 connection*, , and that ] apparently no
effort has been trade â  to create â¢ and router a
direct trade with such Importers. sÂ» It is pointed
out thru the F.ddltioral landed ' cost on the
above lines when re-exported frcm continental
or English markets often t limit* the sale 1 of
sucn goods and, in many absolutely- pre
cludes the possibility , of < their r becoming a
staple line for merchants to carry. ;â -.â : â â â¢>;,
There are many Instances at hand showing
the large Import* of canned ' and dried fruits
and canned vegetables into , countries where
while supposedly exported from Great Britain
and the Continent,' the articles were In reality
largely composed ;of â â  California * and other
American ; irooda of the same class. â¢:,-,.< .Â»--. â¢ â â  .--:.
? Another ; Important 'consideration In dealing
direct with merchants : in the colonies is that
the roods, while not being cold â  In ' such * large
' lots, would not be : subjected *to the ' rigid cus
toms of Euror>Â«en . inspection " prior >to accept
ance, which, 'â  in many cases, leads to condem
nation and creed sale. i. -v , - .- ;
It iÂ«r nuscested that Callfornlan exporters
should atiurae a more aggressive attitude in
reaching out for the direct trade In colonial
possessions, insuring not only better prices
but a more general use of the goods, and that
the opportunity should be seized upon now and
rot left until a firmer hold on such trade is
secured by the British and Continental hand
ler* of such lines.

DEATH CALLS
MILLIONAIRE
James K. Prior, who was widely
known in this city and State, died yes
terday at his home on San Jose ave
nue. He lived six years beyond the
allotted three score and ten and of
these years fifty- two were passed in
San Francisco. He came here from
England in 1853. The first view of
the city and surroundings impressed
him with the belief that here a great
metropolis would be builded. Viewing
the situation from the eminence about
where Mason street intersects Cali- |
fornia, he reasoned that land in the
valley to the south would some day
become very valuable. Prior was a
man of tireless energy, firm In purpose,
temperate, economical and aggressive.
Obstacles In the path of success which
would have daunted and depressed
other men did not turn him aside. In
time he established himself in the
plumbing business. He studied every
opportunity for real estate investment
and became possessed of property on
Market, Mason and Eddy streets, now
in the very heart of San Francisco. He
owned $he land at the southwest cor
ner of Mason and Eddy streets long
before the Waterloo Panorama build
ing was constructed. He also acquired
the land on the northwest corner of
the same streets and bought land
fronting on Market street. He im
proved his holdings and derived a very ,
large income from rents, in Napa,
Santa Clara, San Mateo and San Luis
Obispo counties he acquired large
tracts of Improved and uncultivated
land. A few years ago he was chosen
as a director of the Miller & Lux Com
pany.
Mr. Prior had quite an experience
in the establishment and maintenance
of a lighting plant in San Jose, but
the investment was not highly re
munerative. A valuable ranch, ad
joining the Veterans' Home reserva
tion near Yountville, Napa County, be
longs to the Prior estate.
It is common gossip in business
circles that the wealth of the estate
exceeds $3,000,000.
The late Alvinza Hayward and J. K.
Prior often Interchanged views con
cerning men who were active in the
pursuit of wealth after they had at
tained the age of 70 years. Each
laughingly admitted to the other that
it was the height of folly for a man of
that age to keep on working for more
after he had acquired a million dol- I
lars, but tl\e introspection only re
freshed the spirit of acquisition.
Mr. Prior was in fairly good health
until about eighteen months ago,
when he began to show signs of physi
cal decline. He was a hard worker
from early youth and denied himself
many of the ordinary diversions and
pleasures that render life agreeable.
When Frank S. Kelly, one of his ten
ants, spoke of going to Europe for a
vacation, Prior remarked: "Go and
get something out of life. I never
took but one vacation and that was a
trip to the Cliff House."
In point of business ability Prior
had few equals. His Judgment touch
ing the advisability of investment was
highly regarded. In all affairs he had
the sagacity to keep his own counsel.
He took no one into his confidence
until he was ready to speak.

TRIES TO CASH
A BOGUS CHECK
Police Looking for Young
Stranger Who Attempts to
Negotiate Some Bad Paper
HAILS FROM THE SOUTH
Suddenly Departs From Lo
cal Bank While the Cashier
Is Comparing Signatures
A debonair young man, dressed with
good taste and seemingly well in- |
formed on stock matters, who gives
the name of S. P. Babcock, is being
sought by the local police. Yesterday
he called at the office of E. F. Hutton
& Co., bankers and brokers, In the
Hayward building, and, introducing
himself to Manager R. E. Mulcahy, I
presented a letter of recommendation j
from a well-known Los Angeles firm â¢
of brokers. He explained that he had
come from the south with idea of buy
ing industrials and wanted Hutton &
Co. to act as his agents. It was sug
gested by Manager Mulcahy that it
would be necessary for him to estab
lish his credit by making a deposit
with the firm before he could open an
account.
Babcock promptly exhibited a cer- j
tiflcate of deposit for $5500 in the Citi
zens' National Bank of Los Angeles
and remarked that he would leave it
with Hutton & Co. The certificate
bore the date of March 20 and the sig
nature of A. J. Waters, cashier of the
well-known Los Angeles banking in
stitution. The young man said he
wanted to make several deals, but was
anxious that the fact that he was buy
ing stocks should be kept a secret.
VISITS ANOTHER BANK.
Then he suggested that Hutton &
Co. accept his certificate of deposit,
and, this apparently being agreeable
to Manager Mulcahy, the visitor pro
ceeded with the conversation on other
lines of business, but finally remarked
that he was in need of funds that
afternoon and asked if the manager
could accommodate him with an ad
vance.
Babcock's proposition was that he
deposit $5000 and draw against the re
maining $500 with .a certified check
for that amount on the same bank in
Los Angeles, which he took from his
pocket. Not particularly satisfied with
the character of his visitor. Manager
Mulcahy remarked that he would first
step over to the American National
Bank and ask the cashier to identify
the signature of the Los Angeles cash
ier inscribed on the back of the check,
but Defore Mulcahy could carry out
his intentions Babcock suddenly re
gained his check, and, rising, said he
would go to the bank himself.
MAKES HASTY DEPARTURE.
A few minutes later Babcock ap
peared before Cashier O'Brien's coun
ter in the American National Bank,
and, throwing his check on the coun
ter, said he had been sent there by
Mulcahy. O'Brien, having" no particu
lar reason to suspect the young 1 man, *
took his check and started to the rear
of the bank to compare thÂ« signature
of the certification with that of Cash
ier Waters in Los Angeles. When he I
returned, however, Babcock had left |
the bank and then it dawned on
O'Brien that possibly his visitor was a i
fraud. Immediately communicating
with the Los Angeles bank. O'Brien re- j
ceived a response that no certificate j
of deposit for any amount had been
issued in the name of Babcock, nor
had a check for $500 been certified to
by the bank.
The local bank people notified the
police, who promptly started on a hunt
for the owner of the check. The
Pinkerton agency, representing the
American Bankers' Association, was
also notified and if the young man is
found it is very likely that he will be
prosecuted on a charge of forgery.
Babcock is described as about 30 years
of age, 5 feet 7 inches in height, of
light complexion, smooth shaven and
a good talker.
CLAIM OF ASA R. WELLS'
"CARETAKER" IS REJECTED
Executors Refuse to Allow Her Ap
plication for $1380 Against
Decedent's Estate.
Henry Root, executor, and Miss
Susie H. Wells, executrix of the will of
the late Asa R. Wells, have rejected a
claim for $1380 filed against the estate
by Florence C. Murdock, "caretaker."
The executor and executrix 'of de
cedent's will have also filed more
documents in the contest between Miss
Wells and her stepmother, Reba E.
Wells. They deny Mrs. Wells' claim
that the real estate belonging to de
cedent's estate, located at Eddy and
Taylor streets and on Fourth street,
near Mission, worth $30,000, is com
munity property. It is separate prop
erty, they allege, and ask the court to
grant their petition to have it sold to
meet debts aggregating $20,008 65.
They also object to Mrs. Wells' pe
tition to have the property at Eddy
and Taylor streets set aside as a home
stead. They declare the property Is in
the mercantile section, and that fur
thermore on December 29, 1903, Wells
deeded to Mrs. Wells the family home
at 1404 Jackson street, where Mrs. |
Wells now resides.
Objection is also made to Mrs. Wells' I
petition to have the personalty sold
to meet the debts against the estate, j
It is set forth that this personalty con- ;
sists of 530 shares of stock in the I
Wells-Russell Company, contingently !
valued at $19,000; household furniture
worth $937 50, and other property
valued at $1987 67. The stock, it is
alleged, has no actual value because
it is represented by a wharf franchise
at Point Arena, which expires this
year. An effort will be made to renew
the franchise and the value of the
stock depends upon the success of the
effort.
Child Knocked Down by Street Oar. \

PRIEST FLAYS
BLASPHEMERS
Father Harvey Declares Only
Hell's Warning Fires Can
Keep 3len From Profanity
OATH LEAVES ITS MARK
DiTine Says That False Use
of God's Holy Name Is a
Treachery to the Past
"The name of Jesus, at which the
very devils in hell bow In awe. Is an
expletive In the mouths of those who
would cover their lack of brains and
poverty of speech by the blasphemous
repetition of their Savior's name."
Thus spoke the Rev. Father Francis M.
Harvey In a sermon on "The Second
Commandment" at St. Mary's Cathe
dral last night.
Father Harvey said in part:
If God had not hedged his sacred namt about
with laws entailing dread punishment man
kind would be in far greater danger of viola
ting the first and greatest commandment: for
so free and so flippant are we with this dread
gift of speech that only warning fires of hell
can keep Ua all from a light or profans us*
of this name.
Take away the love of God from a man's
heart and his faith sfcon follows. QÂ«t tnto the
habit of using God's sacred name lightly and
soon God himself will be thought of disre
spectfully. Infidelity will spring up rankly
lrom a soil fed with profanity.
A profane us* of the divtna name reacts
with fatal power upon the soul. We cannot
take, the name of God In vain habitually with
out corrupting and polluting our very con
ception of the divine being
Profanity stultifies and degrades all that !â 
high and noble In man; vulgarize* him and
eventually shuts him out from lofty thoughts
and aspirations.
The profanation that strikes every truly
Christian heart with the greatest horror la
that of the holy name of nur Savior Though
in it*elf the blasphemy be no greater than that
offered the Eternat Father In words that dis
honor thÂ« first person of the blessed Trinity.
yet It strikes the ear and the heart wtth a
special malevolence. It partakes of thÂ« na
ture of thoa* Insults cf the rabble that gath
ered about th* cross and vomited It* Vila, abuse
at the i!efenÂ»eless figure dying before them.
The name of Jesus, to which the very devlla
In hell bow in awe. Is made an expletive In the
mouths of thoa* who would cover their lack
of brains anÂ«i poverty of speech by the blaa
phMnous repetition of their Savior's name.
We have but to think of the manntr in
which our Savior spoke of his Heavenly Father
to see how fatal is th# effect of profanity on
Justice, on law and on sanctity He has
taught us that the Eternal Father Is the
source of %il authority, consequently dlsra
spÂ«ct to him is a movement toward anarchy.
Every false and Ignoble use of this name is
treachery to the past, to the noble deeds of
the past and to the saints and heroes of the
paart. It is a dishonor done to our fathers,
a* well as to the God of our father*, and It
react 3ln fatal Injury on the soul.
The profane word, the oath, the blasphemy,
have left wide the marks of destruction on
human society, destroying characters, defiling
minds, driving away domestic and social peace,
converting blessings Into curses, ruining souls,
working havoc in the temple of Christ, tnto
which w* all have been built.
Aa we contemplate the scene of destruction
and misery wrought by the abuse of the glo
rious gift of speech, by the sneer at holy
things, the veiled doubt at the thing* of faith,
the desecration of the sacred name the open
blasphemy, the bitter curse which takes the
name of the most high God and hurls It as so
much filth at a fellow-creature â when we sea
all this, do we not realize the truth of the
description in St. James. "The tongue Is a fire,
a world of Iniquity; so is the tongue among
our members that It deflleth the whole body
and setteth on flre the course of nature and
it la set on flre of hell?"
God grant that all here can gaae upon this
dark seen- with feelings only of horror and
condemnation.

THURSDAY MARCH 28. 1905
THE VENEZUELA CASE,
THE Senate by rejecting the Santo Domingo treaty has opened
Pandora's box. and the troubles are flying in the air. The Mon
roe doctrine is about to be put to its final test and trial. If it be
f that Castro has made the treaty that is reported with England
â 9d Germany, it amounts to a defensive and offensive alliance with
those monarchies, to endure for fifty years. It was probably his
knowledge that his agent would conclude such an arrangement that
was behind his threat to send an army to invade this country at
New Orleans and make a conquest of the Mississippi Valley. As
that. American* will only regret if he fail to make his threat good.
Hi? declaration of war would give us the opportunity not only to
make short work of his tatterdemalion troops, but to teach him a
lesson thai would be admonitory to the other Latin-American coun
tries that follow his braggart and bandit example.
If he have made the reported treaty, we have also something to
my to Great Britain and Germany, and in saying it will be joined
by France and Italy. The claims covered by this new treaty were ad
judicated at The Hague by our intervention and arrangement. The
'hod and measure of their payment were written in the decree of
tort ("astro, after agreeing to abide by The Hague decision,
N only failed to do so. but has given fresh offense by confis
cating the property of the American asphalt company, of the
reodl cable company, and the mines of the Italian company at
â <anta. If his arrangement with Germany and Great Britain hold.
rT t can be no financial indemnity for these robberies, and he will
iloiltHlti go on and Â«=teal everything in the country that belongs to
tttooals of other countries.
Senate ha* done its best to tie the hands of the President
endanger the Monroe doctrine, the country will be curious to
what that body will do about it. If the new treaty be as it is
â¢ =ented. it is a clear infraction of Monroeism. Tts excuse will
he Senate refused to let the T'nited States administer the rev
- nf those bandit governments, thus leaving no alternative to the
f all European claims except the administration of the revenues
by Europe. As Americans despoiled of their property, chiseled and
cheated in contracts with the Governments, have claims for indem
-ijrainst Guatemala, Nicaragua, Santo Domingo and Hayti, it wiU
ten that the action of the Senate leaves them without recourse or
hope of recoupment. Europe will assume the functions in Latin-
America that belong to us, and we can stand off and see our tradi
tion*: violated, our policy flouted and our interests destroyed.
It is very characteristic that along with the news of Castro's
treaty, by which $26,000,000 will be paid to Germans and English
men, it is announced that he is paid $2,600,000 for making the deal!
That it to c ay. he takes that amount out of the taxpayers of his own
try for betraying them into the hands of Germany and Great
Britain, and knocking out the Monroe doctrine under which we pro
rn> territory from forcible seizure by Great Britain. It is
n to every American claimant against any Latin- American
uountiy, and to all of our international lawyers, that a settlement of
any 1 -'ways possible .by bribing the robber who happens to
control the Government. No doubt other countries have observed
â me thing, and Germany and Great Britain, by the simple ex
pedient of increasing their claims by the sum of $2,600,000. have
â nade a treaty settlement under which they assume a function of
sovereignty in the western hemisphere, in violation of the Monroe
ne. The United States Senate was shocked by the proposition
that we assume that sovereign function by agreement with Santo Do
mingo. What will Mr. (jorman and the Democratic Senators say
hat it is assumed by two European powers by agreement with
ro ?
If President Roosevelt had been heeded, this Castro treaty
would have been impossible, the strength of the Monroe doctrine
: have been unimpaired and our hegemony of the hemisphere
would have been undisputed. Now we abdicate. We are not even
permitted to share leadership with Germany and Great Britain. Gua
fctnala and other so-called republics can follow Castro's lead, make
similar treaties, and not only cheat American claimants, but inflict
upon us a great international humiliation. If we are to save a single
â¢ our prestige in the Monroe hemisphere, it must be done by a
It which will compel Germany and Great Britain to recede
from thi- offensive treaty.
The Senate has enlarged the theater of trouble and put .burdens
upon the country instead of taking them off. We may be able, with
the assistance of France and Italy, to weather the storm by diplo
. We may be able to send the whole matter to The Hague
again, but if we do, we will be practically submitting the Monroe
doctrine to international arbitration. If the judgment go against
us, then what? Heretofore we have considered that doctrine as our
individual affair. If the Senate have lost control of it, what justifica
tion can Mr. Gorman plead to the country?
THE STATE CHARITIES.
r T*HE latest report from the State Board of Charities contains
some interesting information, and several valuable suggestions.
*â¢ It deals not only with those charities which are directly under
the control of the State government, but, using the word State in the
lar^e sense of the whole people, it treats of our State charities ; it is
1 consideration of city and county and private aids to the needy, and
â¢o Â«tudies our whole system of relief to the unfortunate and the
defective.
When considered thus as a system, it is gratifying there is not
much complaint to be made of our doing in the way of chanty. We
have started right and are doing well. The main point of the urging
is that we do more of this well-doing. Most of the information in the
paper shows how imperative is the call to expend more along lines
of work demonstrated by trial to be true charity.
One of the few qjjtjcisms of our present system is in regard to
the relief that it classed as "The Outdoor Poor." This relief is I
disbursed by the county Boards of Supervisors. The law creating !
the State Board of Charities and Corrections has been amended so
as to forbid that board inquiring into such expenditures. Attention
is called to the work done by the State Board of Charities in Indiana i
in the investigation of this outdoor relief. They found that much of
the funds for it went in payment of political debts and for votes. In
one city they found that for every eighteen inhabitants one had re
ceived a part of this relief, and that in one township the proportion
was as high as one to eight inhabitants. The inquiry showed that by
this system there was "no uniformity, little or no investigation, and
little attention to common business principles." So there was an
official extravagance in which the unfortunate and the impostor
shared alike. The experience of Indiana teaches us that the power
of publicity and the force of systematizing and supervising might
prevent either corruption and mistake from creeping in ro cause big
waste in our public charities.
Another recommendation which may be drawn from the infor
atiori of the report is that we should have an institution for epilep
%. There is also special need for much more room for the feeble
lded, not only as a charity to them, but because they arc, when
large, a great injury to the community. On that subject which
uld specially interest Californians, namely, that we have an ex
iinarily large percentage of insane in comparison with all the
other States, the blame is placed upon the larger use of alcoholic
beverages. As for those public charges who have gone hopelessly
broke, the study shows that much the larger proportion of this evil
is explained by the presence of old miners, people who have become
wrecked while chasing the elusive pot of gold. A good example of
this is that Nevada County shows twice as many paupers as Xapa,
lithough the mining county has but a slightly larger population.
A Kansas legislator didn't want to stop work to listen to nn address
â¦y Mr. Bryan. Kight years ago such a man would have met an umpire's
lit* at the hands of an angry Kansas mob. â I>enver Republican.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. MARCH 23. 1905.
THE SHADOWS OF
LITTLE DOUBTS
T. B. EATON
"That is wlmt I did for my
profession." he said tersely.
SLOWLY the canoe crept out past
the point and. emerging from
the heavy shadows that lay, near
the shore, drifted lazily on the
wide, shimmering bosom of the
lake. The big. imperfect disk of the
moon, nearing its full, hung Just
above the ragged line of hills to the
east, and the canoe lay in a broad,
scintillating path of silver that led
across the lake to the black belt of
pines on the eastern shore.
On the other side the hotel was
ablaz? with lights and the bi-weekly
hop was in full swing. Faint, dis
jointed bits of music floated across
the water to the two voyagers. Â
It was evident that / the moonlight
paddle was an impromptu affair, for
the man . was in faultless evening
< lothes and the girl wore a gown of
dazzling white.
. The man. propped comfortably in
the cushions in the bow, smoked
thoughtfully, and silently regarded
the girl as she deftly wielded the pad
dle, or. laying it across the gunwales,
allowed the canoe to drift aimlessly
along the moon-path.
"When they reached the middle of
the lake the man sat suddenly up
right and tossed his cigarette into the
water. Â«
. "Do you know why I wanted this
paddle?:^^te^aikear*lej!rititgr^ toward
the girl. \ : ' ,'â¢ â ;
"I believÂ« your motto is. 'Any tor
ture preferable to a dance,' " she
laughed. Â â â  \ : â ---â -â â : v
He shook his head. â  " /
"You wanted to smoke, then,".; she
suggested. '. ;. .; ; ; ','.'...
â¢'Wrong againâquite wrong." said
he. "My plans have been somewhat
uppet and I shall have to go back to
morrow." â  . ".
Be paused and looked at her smil
ingly. " â¢ - . â  \
"In light of that disaster." he went
on,' "I am going to ask you also to
change your . plans a bit and instead
of waiting the whole month for. my
answer, I shall ask for it to-night â
now." j . \ V â â */Â£â ?Â£
The girl . took up - the paddle and
with a few deft strokes sent the canoe
shooting ahead. Her eyes were-intent
on the water, but he noticed the deep
color come slowly into her cheeks and

"And it is â " he asked with eager

"It is â no," she returned quietly.
The man said nothing, but he put

set in determined fashion.
"Do I presume too much." he said

The girls head drooped and she
was silent. One little hand nervously
clasped and unclasped about the han

"Is it because I'm not overburden

"You know it's not that," she re

"Is it, then, because you don't- â

SOCIAL OSTRACISM IN
THE GERMAN
REALM
In England a man may be a "free
trader" or a "protectionist," a "little
Englander" or a dreamer of imperial
istic dreams without affecting his social
status one way or another. In France
the whole business of politics is rather
outside the highest social life and so-
ciety concerns Itself little with the
Fhades of a man's political opinion.
But in Germany all that is different,
says Scribner's. It is distinctly un
fashionable, in view of the best society,
to hold opinions antagonistic to the
Government, and the weight of that
fact is tremendous in the shaping of
men's opinions. The young man of
good family who finds that with the
adoption of radical political ideas he
meets with distinct coolness in the
homes of his friends, that his name is
dropped from dinner lists and his so
cial acquaintances regard him with dis
favor needs a great deal of courage to
pursue that line of thought. The pow-
er of social opinion, as represented in
aristocratic society, is perhaps no
where more potent in political matters
than in Berlin.
FRENCH AID TO RUSSIA
France was an active partner in the
most infamous performance of Russia,
the highway robbery of Japan in 1895.
says the Minneapolis Tribune. She has
been a silent partner In every form of
infamy, foreign or domestic, by fur
nishing her with money to suppress
nationalities, harry the Jows, slaughter
unresisting Chinese, fill Manrhurla with
troops and Siberia with patriots, starve
a patient peasantry and murder lib
erty-loving students. France bears half
the blame of everything Russia does,
because her money furnished the
means, down to the last bloody mas
sacre of unarmed petitioners In St.
Petersburg. This is a curious office
for a free people of light and leading,
and we suspect that the French people
are pretty sick of it.

"Is that all ?" he asked at length.

"Is it quite adequate?" he asked

She was silent.

Slowly her eyes were lifted to his.
"You say that my profession is my

"Why?" she questioned faintly.
"Because," said he. "for the sake of I

"That Is what I did for my profes- ;

A strain of music drifted out to

"Well, let's go back and have one
more waltz, at least," he said.
But the girl laid her arms on the
I paddle and buried her face in them.
He watched her In uneasy helpless
ness.
"Amy, Amy," he pleaded, "don't do
that. Believe me, I didn't mean to
hurt you."
She lifted her face, flushed and tear
stained.
"You haven't hurt tne." she said
brokenly. "It's simply that I'm glad â

bowed himself off the stage, but
wouldn't give an encore. Afterward I
asked him why he made us work so
hard for an encore. "I want you to

With the Wieniawski "Airs Russes"
the recital came to an end, but for the
rather treacly "Romance Sans Paroles"
of Tschaikow6ky that I don't think we
deserved, Mr. Kreisler. Three more

MRS. OELRICHS
AWAITS A BID
Whether the Fairmont structure on
California-street hill is to be a mag
nificent modern hotel or an elaborately
arranged apartment house, rests en
tirely now upon whatever results are
obtained by Thomas fttaCÂ«C from nego
tiations with whomsoever comes for
ward to lease the handsome monument
to the thrift of the late Senator James
Fair. It was announced yesterday that
Thomas Mage*? has been formally des
ignated by Mrs. Herman Oelrichs as
her sole representative in the leasing of
the Nob Hill building, and that the
question as to whether it -will be fin
ished as a hotel or an apartment house
will be left exclusively to his personal
judgment.
Mrs. Oelrichs departed from New
York for Eurc-pe last Monday, and be
fore sailing she made arrangements
with . Magee for the completion and
leasing of the Fairmont. â . Until re
cently Magee, while enjoying close
business arrangements with Mrs. Oel
richs. was in reality the representative
of the Sharon Estate Company in its
dealings with the Fairmont's owner
for a long lease of the structure as a
hotel. The Sharon Estate Company,
being recognized as a desirable tenant
for. the building, v.as practically given
an option 7? the property, but could
not come to satisfactory arrangements
with Mrs. Oelrichs. When this option
expired recently Magee received an of
fer from Mrs. Oelrichs to act as her
personal agent in the matter, and they
arrived at terms by wire last week.
About six months ago, as was then an
nounced in The Call. Mrs. Oelrichs de
cided that her interests would be better
served if the. Fairmont was finished
as an apartment house instead of a
hotel.
APARTMENT HOUSE PREFERRED
6he said that the only thing that
would change her in these views, which
were shared by Thomas Magee and
other friends and advisers, would be a
satisfactory arrangement with the
Sharon Estate Company. This having
failed she is still determined to have
an apartment house. Discussing the
matter last night at the Palace Hotel,
Magee said:
"1 have been empowered by Mrs. Oel
richs to use my own discretion in the
matter, and if I can obtain a good offer
for a lease of the building for a hotel I
will accept it. But I much prefer to
lease it as an apartment house, and If
some one cornea forward with a satis
factory offer I will use every possible
influence I have with Mrs. Oelrichs in
convincing her that the apartment
house project has more promising re
sults as an Investment than a hotel.
The fact that the dealings between the
Sharon Estate Company and Mrs. Oel
richs have ceased does not mean that
the Sharon people are prevented from
getting the hotel if they want it. They
are aÂ« free to bid as any other people."
KLRKPATRICK'S EYE OPEN.
j Colonel J. C. Kirkpatrlck, manager
' of the Palace Hotel, when asked last
evening whether his company had
given up the idea of leasing the Fair

Yesterday the fact became known

capitalists to secure the Fairmont.
Associated with Bowers in the under
[ taking Is Commander Phelps of the
! battleship Ohio, who has held several
conferences with the Portland man at
the St. Francis during the week. When
seen yesterday at the Occidental Hotel,
where he makes his headquarters when
ashore, Commander Phelps reluctantly
admitted that a deal was on hand, but
declined to make known any of its de-
I tails. Thomas Magee also admitted
that Bowers and his associates are ne
gotiating for a fifteen years' lease, but
he. likewise, declined to discuss the af
' fair further.

JUSTICE SHOWN
IN BAD LIGHT
ALBANY, X. V., March B.â Former
Postmaster A. R. Moore of Fredonia
resumed the stand to-day upon the re
sumption, of the Assembly judiciary
committee's inquiry into the charges
against Supreme Court Justice Warren
B. Hooker. He testified that prior to
January 17, 1899, four clerks were em
ployed at the Fredonia postoflice and
that the work was being satisfactorily
ci<me and that the appointment of five
additional clerks, alleged to have been
made at the beheet of Justice Hooker,
v as not asked for by him.
Ora Caldwell. one of the five clerks
appointed to the Fredcnia postoffice in
January, 1899, at the alleged request of
Justice Hooker, testified that he did
not go to work in the poetoffice until
July 1 following. He identified twu
checks, one for $124 65 and the other
for $150 given him by the postmaster
and admitted that he had never per
formed an hour's service up to the time
he received the checks. He was work
ing at a locomotive works in Dunkirk
at the time, he said. Caldwellfurther
testified that he had never / gTven any
of the money received from' the post
master to any one else and that the
first he had known of his appointment
was when he was handed the check
for $124 65.
Maurice Hooker, nephew of the
Judge, testified that he went to Fre
donia in January, 1902, remaining there
until April, 1904, securing an appoint
ment in the postoffice and attending
the normal school. He said he never
performed any service in the postoffice,
that he received his first pay in Feb
ruary, and each month afterward,
amounting to a salary of $400 a year.
He said that instead of doing the work
in the postoffice himself he arranged
with the postmaster to have it done,
the expense coming out of his salary.
Miss Katherine Clark testified that
she did not think that Judge Hooker
had done anything for her. A letter
dated April 28, 1900, addressed to Bea
vfi-s. from Judge Hooker, read, in part:
"The arrangement concerning Miss
(lark is all right and she will be dp
lighted at what is being done for her."
After this had been quoted to her,
she replied that she did not know Jus
tice Hooker had been securing in
creases In her salary.
SOCIETY WOMEN HUG AND
KISS A CHILD VIOLINIST
NEW YORK, March 22. â With eyes
closed and body swaying to delicious
music, 10-year-old Maurice Warner
laid his head close to his violin this
afternoon and smilingly forgot the
world. It was a big and brilliant
world, in gorgeous raiment, that sur
rounded him in the hotel at. Regis
ballroom. It was at the colonial tea
given by the Eclectic Club to raise
money for the boy's musical educa
tion. The son of a crippled iron
worker, he has become the protege of
the fashionable women of the Eclec
tic.
After his number the boy received
hugs and kisses that would have
turned an older head. More than 600
persons were present, and the benefit
netted more than $1500 for the boy.

SCHOOL HOUSES
TO BE ERECTED
Supervisors Take Initial
Steps for Construction of
the Washington Grammar
TO PROSECUTE WORK
Move Made for Completion
of All Public Buildings
Out of Proceeds of Bonds
The Supervisors' joint committee on
Finance and Utilities began proceed
ings yesterday for the erection of pub
lic buildings under the bond issue by
adopting a resolution directing the
Board of Public Works to submit plans
and specifications for the new Wash
ington Grammar School building. The
plans had already been prepared un
der the special levy for schools, which,
however, was declared invalid by the
Supreme Court. The plans will be at
once available, ?o that the construc
tion of thÂ«? building may be pushed to
an early completion.
It was agreed that L. S. Stone, who
prepared the plans, will he appointed
as supervising architect for the con
struction of the building, he to receive
a fee to be fixed later. The building
of several other schools which have
been prepared will also be ordered in
the near future.
Supervisors d'Ancona and Braunhart
were appointed a committee to draft
an ordinance for the construction of all
public buildings for which plans have
not been prepared as yet. Tha com
petitive system for the adoptionpof the
plans will be provided for in the or
dinance on the lines recommended by
San Francisco Chapter. American In
stitute of Architects. A jury of award
will be appointed and the architect
whose plans ar* selected will he the su
pervising architect of the building. It
is expected that the local architects
will oppose the proposition to allow
competition to come from the East, it
being desired to confine the competi
tion to California only.
The committee agreed that the con
struction of the buildings will be un
der the direct supervision of the Board
of Works. All plans for school build
ings will be submitted to the Board of
Education for acceptance before the
Board of Supervisors will authorize
the work and set aside the necessary
funds from the bond proceeds for the
purpose.
As preliminary to the building of the
new City and County Hospital, thÂ«
Board nf Works was requested to pre
pare plans and estimates of cost for
the grading of the site.
The committee decided to ask the
Board of Health for plans of the new
hospital buildings: the Police Commis
sioiiprs and Sheriff for plans of the
County Jail and additions to the Hall
of Justice, and the Board of Educa
tion for pian? of all the school huild
ins.- to be liuilt out of bond moneys.
The Commissionprs of Works and
the members of the Board of Educa
tion who werp present agreed with
thf committee that there will be no de
lay in the prosecution of the work on
the construction of all the contem
plated public buildings.

SAYS SCHOOLS
WILL BENEFIT
Roncovieri Pleased Over New
Law Fixing Minimum Al
lowance for San Francisco
GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL
Supervisors Now Compelled
to Appropriate at Least
$7 for Each Child in City
President Roncovieri of the Board oÂ£
Education received information yester
day that the Governor had signed the !
bill which provides that the Board of
Supervisors of every county must an- j
nually levy a county school tax, the j
maximum rate of which must not ex- :
ceed 50 cents on each $100 of taxable
property, nor the minimum rate be less j
than $7 per census child.
Hereto-fore San Francisco has been j
the only county exempted from the ,
provisions of sections 1817 and 1818 of
the Political Code, which fixed the min
imum sum to be allowed for the sup
port of the schools. The bill which is
nmv the law is amendatory of the two
sections quoted and wilt compel the
Supervisors to appropriate at least $7
on each census child. As there arÂ«
about 100,000 of such children it means
that not less than $700,000 must be con
tributed by the city of San Francisco
for the support of its own schools. The
amendment was passed on the petition
of the California Htate Teachers' Asso
ciation which met last year in San
Jose. It was designed to fix the mini
mum allowance at $8. but the $.7 rate
was adopted as a compromise.
President Rono^vieri says that the ;
amendment will prevent a hostile
Board of Supervisors from ap- ,
propriating an insufficient amount for
school purposes. In 1903 the Board of
Supervisors allowed but $4 49 for each
cens-.is child. Last year but $3 20 was
allowed, and Roncovieri feared that
this year the sum would be less if the
amendment had not passed. The rest
of the revenue for schools, amounting
to nearly $1,000,000, came from the
State.
The new State apportionment law !
will give San Francisco but $700,000
yearly in the future and Rencovieri ,
says that the $7 rate will realize about j
$700,000 additional. Even these two t
amounts combined, Rononvieri says, j
are Inadequate for the schools, but the 1
Supervisors have the power to levy a
tax not to exceed 50 cents on every $100
for school purposes, which would fix
the maximum amount that may be ap
propriated by San Francisco at $2,500,
000.
Thomas E.. Atkinson, Assemblyman
of the Thirty-ninth District, will be ap- '
pointed Chief Census Marshal by the
Board of Education at its meeting to- j
day. Atkinson held the position last
year and made a splendid showing in ,
his returns.

JABEZ WHITE EN ROUTE
TO PACIFIC COAST.
English Fighter Will Have Four Weeks Training
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, March 22.â Charley
Mitchell, manager of Jabez White, the
English lightweight champion boxer,
announced this afternoon that the
match had been arranged by telegraph
between his protege and Jimmy Britt.
White and Mitchell left for the West
at 8 o'clock to-night. While White's
bout with Britt is assured, no date has
been selected. It is expected Britt and
White will meet some time between
April 24 and 29. Mitchell said White
would require only three weeks solid
training. Presuming that the trip will
consume one week, as Mitchell will
stop over in Buffalo for a day, White
will have more than a month to get
into trim if the pair meet on April 24.
Mite hell's visit to Buffalo is due to
the fact that he wants to see his son,
Charles Alexander Mitchell, who is be
ing educated at one of the colleges in
that city. Young Mitchell will accom
pany his father to San Francisco and
will assist in getting White into shape.
He i? a clever fellow with the gloves,
strong and vigorous. Mitchell thinks
he is just the sort of a boy to work out
White.
Within the next two weeks another
English fighter will arrive in this
country prepared to fight any young
ster at his weight on this side of the
Atlantic. This fighter is little Owen
Moran, the bantamweight scrapper of
Birmingham. He defeated Jim Bow
ker. who bested Frankie Neil in a fif
teen round bout some few months
since. Tom O'Rourke has asked
Mitchell to cable for Moran to come to
this country as soon as possible.
O'Rourke will be Moran's manager
while he is in ' U! Â«: country. He will
match him against Frankie Neil.
Before leaving for the West Mitchell
announced that no one would be al
lowed to see White at his training. All
his work will be done behind* closed
doors. Whether this means that White
is known to be physically unfit for a
meeting with such a rushing fighter as
Britt or whether he does not want to
show his style is open to conjecture.
The announcement Is not expected to
help the fight to any extent.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, MARCH 23, 1905.
KNGLISH BOXER WHO IS COMING
TO THIS CITY TO FIGHT
BRITT.
BIG FIGHTERS
ARE CONFIDENT
The fact that Jack Johnson is about
to engage in the most important ring
battle of his career has by no means
put a damper on his spirits. The big
colored fellow is simply overflowing
with good nature and smiling all the
time. He entertains no thought of de
feat and only speaks of the approach
ing mill when an outsider brings up
the subject.
Johnson intends betting hie all on
his ability to beat the Kentucky fight
er. He has already arranged to go on
the stage after the fight, under the
direction of Henri Stewart, an Eastern
theatrical man, who is of the opinion
that the black fighter will be a great
drawing card if successful in the Hart
affair.
Before starting his afternoon's gym
nasium work at Joe Mlllett's, near
Colma, yesterday, Johnson ran a 100
yard dash with one of his trainers
and showed remarkable speed for a
heavy man. He might have been a
ten-second man had he devoted him
self to sprinting instead of to pugilism.
Only a few rounds of boxing were
indulged in, the big fellow not wishing
to take any unnecessary chances of in
juring his hands. Sparring will not be
entirely eliminated, however, until after
Sunday. Johnson weighs 193 pounds
and claims to be In finer fix than he
has been for the past two years.
Like Johnson, Marvin Hart is plug
ging away at his work out at the Ocean
Beach and the monotony of his daily
grinds has yet to affect his spirits.
Most fighters, especially heavy men,
usually become cranky just before a
contest and a: â ? attacked with occa
sional fits of the sulks. Hart, how
ever, Is an exception to the rule and
doesjhot show anything but a smiling
countenance.
The Toby Irwin-Fred Landers pre
liminary was a fortunate engagement
by Manager Greggains, and the bout
is attracting considerable attention.
They are to box ten rounds at 133
pounds, the weighing in time having
been set for 5 o'clock. It is a winner
take-all proposition.
To-day is the time set for the selec
tion of a referee. Both sides would
like to Â«cc Greggains take the respon
sible position, but he is shy for the
reason that it does not look well for
the manager of a club to expose him
self to criticism as judge of the hap
penings in the ring. In case the box
ers do not agree on a referee the ar
ticles provide that the club is to make
the selection.

VAN DER NALLLKN TEAM
FAILS TO HIT EFFECTIVELY
Uck Nine Easily Defeats Boys From
the Engineering School In a
Pitchers' Battle.
Inability to connect safety with
"Brick" White's delivery was the cause
of defeat of the Van der Naillen base
ball team by the boys from the Lick
School yesterday at the Golden Gate
Park grounds. Not until the seventh
Inning, which was the last, was a hit'
chalked against the crack pitcher of
the Lick team and this one saved the
boys "from the engineering school from
being whitewashed. The final score
was sto 1. The fielders on both teams
had little chance to show their work,
as hits were scarce. Both pitchers did
exceptional work. White forced more
than twelve batsmen of the Van der
Naillens to fan the atmosphere.
Lick got in the running in the open
ing period, scoring two runs on a
brace of hits and two errors. The
score remained unchanged until the
sixth round, when Lick added another
one. In the final spasm both teams
scored. Lick put two over the pan on
a base on balls and errors. After
Treuler had reached second on an
error and a steal, Wayland came
through with the only hit and saved
his team from a shut-out. This waa
the last practice game between these
teams until the regular series begins.
The following is the line-up:
Lick team â Hall, catcher; Hotchklsa, short
stop; Barrleau, first base; White, pltchor;
D-sarin. third base; Acto 1, left field; Boyd,
rieht Held; Gleak. n, center field, and Nash,
second base.
Van der Naillens â Amstutz, left field; Crig
ler, second bane; Perry, shortstop; Gayner,
first base; Mlncher, third base; Cady, centei
field; Treuler, pitcher; Wayland, catcher;
Reher, right field. Umpire â Snell.
Rowing Races Postponed.
. BERKELEY, March 22. â The inter
class rowing races, which were to

was filed in the Recorder's office.

A be Meyer Disposes
of Daruma by a
Short Head.
David Boland Runs
Circles Around
His Field
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Dr. Leggo resumed practice again
yesterday at Oakland track. The crack
3-year-old from the McCafferty stable
met Judge, Nigrette and three others
of different pedigrees and uncertain
ages in the $1000 handicap at one and
one-sixteenth miles, and slipped them
one. Perforce of circumstances the
Doctor made presents of weight to each
of the other starters, but it mattered
not to the medicinally inclined equine.
They all looked like sixes and sevens
to him. The only one to prove at all
obdurate, inasmuch that he required
subduing, was Judge, and he yielded
to treatment without the use of an
anesthetic. The bookmakers thought
well of tbe McCafferty entry with his
105 pounds, making him an 8 to 5 fa
vorite.
JUDGE SWERVES AT START.
But for swerving out at the start.
Judge might have collected the large
end of the Â£>urse. Even after this
costly bit of tomfoolery the black horse
went to the front, hewing out a merry
old clip, trailed by Nigrette and the
favorite. On the stretch turn Too
man, on Dr. Leggo, moved into second
position and started after the leader.
Handridden only, he collared Judge at
the paddock, winning with nothing es
pecial up his sleeve by a head in
1:47%. Nigrette, carrying 109 pounds,
ran a close third.
Favorites scored a standoff by cap
turing three of the events on the card.
The track was in fairly good condition,
and the attendance large.
Hulford, an acrobat of renown, cap
tured the introductory six furlong sell
ing number. The odds against the
brother to Gaviota were forced down
from 4 to 1 to 11 to 6 favoritism and
with Bell up he spreadeagled his field.
In a drive, Laura F. M. snatched the
place from Riesca by less than a
length. Berendos, which opened favor
ite, ran a tame race.
ABE MEYER IS IMPROVED.
Harry Stover's youngster Abe Meyer
showed vast improvement over his
previous essay in the two-year-old
scramble at five furlongs. Daruma on
recent performances looked a certainty,
if such a thing exists in racing, and
she received heavy support at even
money. Birkenruth got the favorite
away in front and the filly looked all
over a winner during the easy stages
of the running. Hoffman on Abe Meyer
made no mistakes this trip and, grad
ually wearing down the leader, earned
a neck, decision. Busy Bee finished a
close third. The winner closed at odds
of 4 to 1.
If J. V. Kirby ran his race in the
mile and a furlong selling affair, then
he is a bad horse. The Strobel entry
went to the post an even money chance,
and the best Otis could do was to drop
in fourth position. Dandie Belle, an
extensively touted one, made all the
running, only to be picked up the last
sixteenth and beaten a head by Hom
age, an 11 to 1 shot. "Big Bill" Knapp
rode an excellent race on the winner.
BEST MAN FINISHES SECOND.
Dr. Rowell's Best Man drove all of
the short-end players into insolvency.
The big lumbering gelding was played
down from 9 to 20 favoritism to take
the seven-furlong selling run, and ran
second. After receding in the betting
from Vh. to 9 to 1, Tom Ryan's Flaunt
had assumed charge of affairs before
the stretch was reached, and won clev
erly by two lengths. Trapsetter finish
ed third, six lengths behind the favor
ite.
Elaborate preparations had been
made for the safe arrival at the wire of
David Boland in the closing six-furlong
sprint, and the gelding made good. He
ruled favorite and led from start to fin
ish. Eckersall. astride which Wright
gave a rare exhibition of patience and
waiting powers, downed My Order for
the place.
TRACK NOTES.
Twenty books cut in yesterday.
Leslie Coggin is now thej owner of
Esherin, having purchased the mare
from P. Ryan.
W. B. Sink Jr. recently sold the
two-year-old filly Nettie Hicks by
Rubicon-Loulou R to Fred Levers.
Jakie Jones, who piloted Busy Bee,
was fined $50 for rough riding, just
after leaving the barrier.
Some days ago the judges at Oak
land told Alarie to accept no more
mounts. The action was taken after
the improved showing made by I'm
Joe. When Hulford came out yester
day and spreadeagled his field the of
ficials added the rider's name to the
suspended list.

Fifty Per Cent, Finally
Reaches Her Destination
The schooner W. H. Dimond, which

cheer those In distress over the sup
posed loss of the schooner Pearl.** The
Dimond left here to gather codfish from
the northern fishing stations, and was

Barkentlne Puako Safe.
ThÂ« reported loss of the barkentin* Puako,
owned by Hind, Rolph & Co. of this city, was
a tr!2e premature, for while the message tell
ing cf the- vessel's destruction off Cape Flat
tery in a November laet storm was being
tapped c\-er the wires the cable was bearing
news of her safe arrival at Port Natal, her
destination. Th* Puako. Captain George Selee,
left Bellingham November 6 for Natal. A few
days efter she sailed a terrific storm swept
the waters in the vicinity of Cape Flattery.
Wreckage â was found later on the shores of
Vancouver Island. The Puako made a long
package end we* not reported at all after lev
ing Puget Sound. Wcrd was received yester
day, however, that ehÂ« had arrived at Natal
with all ou board well. Captain Selee, was c
compnled by his wife and daughter. The
Puako wa# on the overdue list and quoted for
reinsurance at .'hi per cerrt.

MRS. NORRIXGTOX IS
AGAIN DEPORTED
Authorities nt Victoria Refuse to Per
ink Her to Land There and She
Cannot Remain Here.
Mrs. Margaret Norrington, who was
deported to Victoria on the City of
Puebla March 11, was denied a land
ing at that port and arrived here yes
terday on the same steamer. Com
missioner North has refused to permit
her to land pending the action of a
special board of inquiry, which will
meet to-day.
Mrs. Norrington is an English wom
an, 76 years old. She arrived here on
the steamer Senator from Victoria on
March 3, having been deported by the
colonial authorities. She told the im
migration officials here that she ar
rived in this city from Dunedin, New
Zealand, last February on the ship
May Queen to join her sister in Oak
land. She learned that her sister had
gone to Victoria. Then she went to
Victoria and was informed that her
sister had gone to the Klondike. Be
ing without money, the Victoria au
thorities gave her lodgings in the city
jail and deported her to this city the
next day. Being penniless and having
no relatives here, she was refused a
landing and was deported again to
Victoria. The British authorities sent
her back and as she will not be admit
ted here the steamship company will
protest against taking her back and
forth.

mittee visittd St. Louis it did not call
upon him or aryr exposition officials.
The commission's charges against the
exposition management in connection
with the sale of exhibit sÂ»ward ribbons,
he says, are libelous. President Fran
cis adds:
Award ribbons are sold by concessionary
â Oteljr no exposition official having any in
terest therein. Their sale was permitted by
the exposition for the accommodation of ex
hibitors, but was restricted to those receiving
awards, and other purchase* of such ribbons
are frauds, to which both concessionaire and
purchaser are parties, and both will be. proo
ecuied in every instance.
All charges that awards of this exposition
are a subject of commercial barter are wholly
fals" and their authors willful falsifiers, and
I those who repeat them belong to the earn"
csÂ»sÂ«. Award diplomas and medals will be
delivered to successful exhibitors without
charge and as soon as possible. Of course the
awanl ribbon concessionaire lias nothing what
ever to do with conferring awards.
AFTER FOUR YEARS SHE
LEARNS OF FATHER'S I>EATH
Mrs. Frank M. Switzer Causes Sus
pension of Execntor of De
cedent's Will.
H. W. Mathews has been suspended
aa executor of the will of the late
Newell W. Crocker, who died here
four years ago. The suspension is the
result of a communication received by
Attorney William J. Herrin from Bar
rister William F. O'Connor of Hali
fax, Nova Scotia, representative of
Mrs. Frank, M. Switzer. decedent's
only daughter. In his communication
Barrister O'Connor sets forth that his
client has just learned of her father's
death. The fact that she was kept so
long in ignorance she ascribes a "a
woman in the case." "First of all,"
Bays O'Connor in his communication,
"Crocker was a divorced husband and
the one at fault. We surmise that the
Mrs. Hattie T. Lewis mentioned in the
will is "the woman in the case.' "
In the will Crocker left $500 to his
daughter and the residue of his small
estate to Mrs. Lewis. Mathews was
named as executor of the will, but af
ter qualifying as such he did not car
ry on the settlement of the estate with
due diligence, with the result that
Mrs. Switzer's rights were neglected.
"It appearing from the papers in
the case," said Judge Coftey in his or
der suspending Mathews, "that the
executor has wrongfully neglected the
estate, he is hereby suspended and or
dered to appear to show cause why
his letters should not be revoked."

CITY T O HAVE
NEW HOSPITAL
Halmemann Medical College
Lets Contracts for the
Erection of Big Building
San Francisco will soon have an
other modern hospital. The Hahne
mann Medical College has let a con
tract for the construction of a three
story brick building to be erected at
the northeast corner of California and
Maple streets. The new hospital will
cover an area of 122 by 128 feet and
will be built on new and up-to-date
lines at a cost of $120,000. The plans
of the architects, Henry H. Meyers and
Clarence R. Ward, have been approved
and work on the new/ building will be
gin shortly. The architecture is de
scribed as follows:
The style of architecture will be an adapta
tion of the New England colonial and the ma
terials used will be red brick, trimmed wtth
stone.
Among the special features of this new hos
pital will be inclined planes throughout the
building, instead of stairways. These will
facilitate the removal of patients. The chil
dren's ward will be in the dome of the struc
ture, and special chute fire escapes will be
placed in various parts of the building.
The operating pavilions will be the finest in
the West. Every sanitary device known to
modern surgery will be placed in these rooms,
thus insuring per.ect results. Large solariums
will be placed on the top floor, ao that the
phtients may get the benefit of the sun's rays
to cure them of their ailments. The floors will
be deadened, so that the patients will not be
disturbed by noises. The entire building will
be thoroughly ventilated and heated by forced
draught The latest scientific ideas will be
used to insure perfect and complete plumbing.
All fixtures are to be of non-absorbent ma
terial.
The new hospital will be maintained on
broad professional and social lines. It will
possess no sectarian ideas, be governed by no
faction, possess the greatest liberality of
thought and service, open to any physician of
any school and will bid welcome to all forms
of non-contagious diseases and surgical cases.
The building fund committee is composed
of the following gentlemen: W. W. Van Ars
dale. chairman: Harland Law, M. D.. F. G.
Sanborn. E. R. Lillenthal, Marshall Hale, W.
P. Fuller, W. Letts Oliver, William Bcericlce,

FRANCIS B. LOOMIS IS
HERE FROM WASHINGTON
First Assistant Secretary of State
Comes West on a Pleasure
Trip.
Francis B. Loomis, First Assistant
Secretary of State, arrived here at a
late hour last night from Washington
and is registered at the St. Francis Ho
tel. He has been coming westward by
easy stages, and reached Merced last
Saturday. From there he went to his
ranch in Mariposa County. It is ex
pected that the distinguished visitor
will be the recipient of many courtesies
during his short stay in San Francisco,
for he ranks among the most promi
nent of the American diplomats-'of the
day.
Secretary Loomis was formerly Min
ister to Portugal, and later served this
Government in a similar capacity in
Venezuela, where he came frequently
in contact with President Castro. He
is a man thoroughly conversant with
Venezuelan affairs, although not dis
posed to discuss them in public, owing
to his position in Washington.

REFUSE TO DIVULGE
SOURCE OF INFORMATION
Colorado Newspaper Men Are Ques
ttooed Concerning Bribery
Charges.
DENVER, March 22.â Managing edi
tors and reporters of newspapers in
which stories hinting at bribery of
members of the present Legislature
have appeared from time to time were
examined by the legislative bribery in
vestigating committee to-day. The
former said that they had no personal
knowledge of the truth of the details
of articles written by their assembly
reporters, but they believe their stories
to be accurate.
The reporters themselves said that
it was a matter of general knowledge
that a large lobby was maintained at
the State house during the gubernator
ial contest, and while they, had the best
authority for the printed statements
that money was spent as bribes, they
declined to state the sources of their
information, because they were pledged
not to do so.

WOULD EMPIRE
NOT HIS DREAM
German Emperor Says He
Took Vow Not to Strike
for Mastery of Nations
BREMEN March 22. â At a banquet
in the town hall to-night, given In
honor of unveiling of a monument of
Emperor Frederick, Burgomaster
Pauli made a speech in which he re
ferred to the first German fleet hav
ing been sold under the auctioneer's
hammer, and said that the model of
the admiral's ship was in the Bremen
town hall.
Emperor William replied, saying
that when he was a youth he stood by
that model and felt deeply enraged at
the disgrace done the German flag.
That, perhaps, showed him how to
comprehend the tasks of the German
empire. He had sworn an oath of
fidelity to the flag and that when he
became the head of the Government
he would "do everything possible to
let bayonets and cannon rest, but to
keep the bayonets sharp and the can
non ready, so that envy and greed
from without would not disturb us In
tending our garden or in building our
beautiful house. I vowed," the Em
peror continued, "never to strike for
world mastery. The world empire
that I then dreamed of was to create
for the German empire on all sides
the most absolute confidence as a
quiet, honest and peaceable neighbor.
I have vowed that If ever the time
comes when history shall speak of a
German world power or of a Hohen
zollern world power this should not
be based upon conquest, but come
about through a mutual striving of
nations, after common purposes."
The Emperor continued: "After
much has been done internally in a
military way, the next thing must be
the arming of ourselves at sea. Every
German battleship is a new guarantee
for the peace of the world and less
ready will our foes be to attack us
and the more valuable will we become
as an ally."
CHURCH CIRCLES AGITATED.
Debating Proposed Rejection of Rock-
efeller's Gift.
BOSTON, March 22.â Church circles
are much agitated over the petition of
New England Congregational minis
ters against acceptance of John D.
Rockefeller's gift of $100,000 by the
American Board of Foreign Missions.
Most of the clergymen of Boston
praise the ministers who have asked
the American board to decline th-Â± gift
and very few who favor its acceptance
can be found among the laymen.
The prudential committee of the
American board, which has power to
accept or refuse the gift, is said to be
in favor of taking it. It does not argue
that the contention of the petitioners
that the money is "tainted" and was
questionably obtained is wrong, but it
points out that the Baptist Board of
Missions acceDted $260,000 from Rocke
feller about four years ago without a
question, and Oberlin College In 1900
accepted a gift of $100,000 from the
same source without raising any ques
tion as to its moral right to do so.
In the event of adverse action by the
prudential committee, the signers of
the memorial may appeal to the Amer
ican Board, which will hold its annual
meeting in Seattle, Wash., in Septem
ber. This board is made up of clergy
men and laymen from the different
States. Among the laymen are many
men prominent in the business and of
ficial affairs of the country.
Denies Rumors of Hold-Up.
Charles Henry, now in the Broad
way jail, denies the rumor that he
had told Henry Fitzaimmons of Point
Richmond last summer that he had
heard two men planning the hold-up
of Daly and Roche near Steare.

STOCKSâ The heavy decline is absolutely
tonexpfelnable except for two features â one the
Veaeiuelan difficulty, which , has not assumed
try proportion to cause anxiety, and the other.
the carrying of heavy lines of speculative to
â¢ues by certain large operators here that have
b'-*r. pyramided. In the day's decline one
thing was a â that every- professional
trader in the street was a bear, hence it is
quite puzzling to know who bought the large
blocks cf important railway securities.
COTTON â Sentiment Â»'as' mixed, but "there
was general celling by spot Interests who were
buyers yesterday and on good weather In the
South the market became, easier. There were
ijm good buying orders on a .scale down, but
not sufficient to hold thÂ« market. The im
pression prevails that the May option is in the
hards of spot Interests and that unles* there
ie some cotton headed this way the shorts will
tine; themselves in trouble over their commit
ments above mentioned. On any further de
cline we would prefer buying.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 22.â The growing in
6iCerence ot the demand for stocks bad a
ctliling effect on speculative sentiment and
the level of {trices was let down considerably
further to-day in spite of the constant irregu
larity ot the market. The fluctuations were
largely due to the activity of the board-room
tracers of the larger class, ' whose position
was occ&sionaily shifted In the progress of
maneuvers designed probably to evade an uu
6efcii%.ble following. Thle shifting process in
; .volvÂ«d the buying of stocks now ana then,
knit there was no evidence of positive strength
lin the market at any time. The growing
conviction that no aggressive upward move
ment, is. to be looked for in the immediate
future prompted considerable throwing over of
securities by holders not prepared to retain
their contracts through an Indefinite decline.
The t.t-iiient over Venezuelan relations
continued to be. the subject of discussion, and
â¢v -h.'.e no oucd was perceived for immediate
&i&rm it was felt that the - progress of the
.: a.C&irs concerning various powers in interest
offered a deiic&xe situation, with I room for
troublesome developments. The action taken I
jesterday by the directors of the Corn Products I
Cfcmpany In.' reducing tbe dividend on the pre- j
erred Block bad a decidedly . unfavorable in- i
Cuence. especially coupled as it was with the !
pecsimistic remarks of Che president of the !
company on conditions 'In . that trade. The
â¢hutting down of sugar refineries was cited
as a parallel to Ehx>w that trade might not '
be undeviatingly prosperous in all lines. The
persistent heaviness, 01. the United States Steel
EtcckÂ£ in spite of ail the glowing reports of .
the - :. -niouÂ» demand 1 for its products had a
dibcour&ging fleet on the advocates . of higher
prices. The merely nominal improvement in
dicated in the New York Central net earnings
for the March quarter although compared with
a period .ast year of extraordinary obstacles
to transportation, was not relished. More
attention was paid than recently to the ap
parent officially inspired disclaimers of some
of the lately prevalent rumors of Intended
tf'x-idend increases, and stocks which have

reported -once more to have been negotiated
In France and the imminence of another Jap
anese issue was also taker, a' count of for the
requirement on the money markets, especially
In view of the reported participation by Amer
ican bankers. In the case of the last Japanese
loan these subscriptions involved shipments
of goia to Japan. The first transfers of cur
e reccy through the sub-treasury to New Or

Hay and Feedstuffs.
There is nothing new* in Feedstuffs. The
circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"Receipts of Hay for the week have amount
ed to 2220 tons, considerably lesÂ« than we have
been receiving of late, but still this quantity
is heavy for the winter season, and under
present conditions more than the market can
well stand. Recently there has been no outlet
for the large amount of Hay coming to mar
ket except local consumption, and In conKe
quenee buyers are well Bupplied, and stocks
on storage here in town are sufficient to fill
all ordinary demands for some little time.
"The abundant rains and general high tem
peratures which have prevailed throughout the
country have done much toward advancing the
new crop and have made grass plentiful, so
that many of the stock and dairy men feed
no Hay at all. As Â» result, alfalfa and stock
Hay are especially plentiful and sell only at
very low figures. This is also true of any
thing that is off grade or damaged.
"Crops in general are maturing very rap
idly and will have to be cut early in the
season. A continuance of the heavy rain*
would cause much damage to the new crop
and would be a great hindrance to properly
curing new Hay."

GkÂ»w*B Seat Back to Jail
STRETIES EXONERATED
Judge Lav. lor Takes Action
in View of Error Admit
â¢: tedly Made by Judge Cook
Joreph f?mith. he aged contractor
who shot and. killed Joseph 'E. Mc-
Gowan in a brickyard on Mission street
on th* morning; of November 26, was
ordered Into custody by Judge I.awlor
ycFt^rdsy Smith had been released on
120.000 bonds by order of Judge Cook,
who at the time said he had perused
the evidence and did not believe the
defendant could be convicted of a cap
ita! offense . -"I â¢ - .'*;>
J'uigf: Lav. loi. in rendering his de
on the motion of the District At
torney to or4er Smith into custody,
said that Judge Cook had informed him
that he had ir.flde the order fixing bail
without having ihÂ« authority to do so.
The application for the writ of habeas
corpue had been made to him and he
had made it returnable to himself in
stead of to the Superior Court, which
af an error.
"It is not neiessary for me to ex
an opinion as to Judge Cook's
conclusion, " continued Judge Lawlor.
The information against the defend
ant has been filed in my court, and it
is for m*Â» to take action. The contention
of the defendant that the action of
Judge Â«'<Kk in allowing the defendant
cut or. bail stops me from interfering
is not sound In this Instance. After

CHINESE EDITOR TRIES
WIT AND IS TROUNCED
He Comments on Display of Feminine Feet

Joss House Opening.
Two Indignant Male Relatives of Twitted Fair
Ones Invade Sanctum and Chastise
Humorist.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Ong Tick "Won, editor of a Chinese
daily newspaper, committed the indis
cretion of attemrning; to be funny in
print, and while some of his compa
triots were laughing over the intended
persiflage, two others, Yung Ting Ye
and Sue Qua. invaded his sanctum and
smote him full sore. They we defend
ants before Police Judge Mogan on
the charge of battery, and as each of
them promptly obtained release by de
positing $20 bail, the unhappy Ong
Yick Won, evidently fearing a renewal
of their onslaught, has retained the
valiant Ah Wing, conqueror of many
Caucasian prizefighters, to protect his
person.
The subjects of Ong Tick Won's
flight at facetiae were several moon
eyed maidens who participated in the
ceremonies incidental to the dedication
of a new josshouse last Sunday. In
the preliminary pageant they rode
horseback and wore flowing veils that
completely concealed their faces from
the heathen stare, but their feet were
exposed to public view and it was by
humorously alluding to their feet that
Ong Tick Won put his own foot into it.
"These foolish maidens.' is alleged
to Lh a literal translation of Ong Yick
Won's comment, "wou'd surely have
hidden their feet and shown their faces
if they had but realized that their feet
were large."
To call a Chinese female a "big
foot woman" is equivalent to quae
tioning her chastity, and as the maid
ens twitted by Ong Yick Won were
highly respectable their masculine cou
sins waxed very wrath over the twit.
Hints of their anger reached Ong
Yick Won ere they appeared at the
door of his office and sought admit
tance, and he had locked himself in.
By strategy, however, Yung Ting Ye
and Sue Qua. merchants both, ran the
blockade and pounced upon Ong Yick
Won as he sat at his desk endeavor
ing to frame a retraction that might
satisfy the offended ones without sac
rificing his own dignity. The two in
vaders used only the weapons with
which nature had equipped them, and
they punched Ong Yiek Won's nose
and eyes and smashed his spectacles
ere they considered the honor of their
respective houses sufficiently upheld.
After he had procured the arrest of
his assailants Ong Yick Won sent for
Ah Wing and engaged him to serve as
bodyguard until \ Chinatown's select
circles have recovered their equanim
ity. Meantime there is eager awaiting
of to-day's issue of Ong Yick Won's
Journal, with even money offered that
It will not contain one hieroglyphic of
reference to the shaming of his face.
Yung Ting Ye and Sue Qua are con
fidently expected to forfeit their bail.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed the mur
der charge against Marcus Smith (col
ored), who fatally stabbed George Ste
wart, champion Afro-American cake
walker of the Pacific Coast, on the
night of March 4 in a Pacific-street
dance hall. The testimony showed that
Smith stabbed in self-defense. He was
manager of the place and was at
tacked by Stewart because he demand
ed that the latter pay him 20 cents for
two dances in which he had revolved
with Mfss Tillie Jeffers. Not until he
had been twice knocked down did
Smith begin hiÃ knife^work.
Adolf Stein and John Lupasco were
returning from a mask ball and M.
Terrogioro and T. T. Thornhill were
homeward bound from an amateur
prizefight when the quartet clashed on
Kearny street, directly opposite the
Hall of justice, at a very early hour of
yesterday. Mr. Stein was attired in a
yachting costume of snowy duek â at
the ball he had masqueraded as Sir
Thomas Lipton â and it wr.s jeering al
lusions to his appearance from Messrs.
Terrogioro and Thornhill that started
the fracas. Patrolman Reed informed
Judge Fritz that when he (Reed)
emerged from the hall his attention
was attracted by c white object flash
ing among several dark bodies and in
vestigation disclosed to him Mr. Stein
and his companions commingled in
combat with the other two defendants.
He split them out and then herded
them into the prison, and when the
Judge had heard the particulars he
discharged all four, apparently consid
ering their twelve hours' Incarceration
sufficient punishment for their offense.
Frank Kelly, charged with having
stolen a valuable ring from Mrs. Lot
tie Gauthier of 1456 Eighth avenue,
was committed for burglary by Judge
Mogan. A second charge of the same
caliber will be heard to-morrow.

given eighty days by Judge Conlan.

He was booked as Milton Rice, but

"Something about a woman having
deserted you, wasn't it?" his Honor
asked.
"That's what. She was as fair as
she was false."
"Oh, yes; now I remember. She left
you to visit her parents in the country
ere she became your wife, and she
neglected to returnâ something of that

"You have it right. And ever since

Mrs. Augusta Steudeman of 1223
Jones street was the victim of the little
brown convert's lapse from grace. He
was employed by her as a domestic,
and soon proved himself such a model
servant that without misgiving she
could leave him sole custodian of her
domicile. Among her treasured pos
sessions was $125 worth of material for
a silk dress, which she left in an open
drawer when she went abroad, so firm
was her confidence in Ono's integrity.
One day, however, when 3he went to
inspect the goods she found the drawer
as bare as Mother Hubbard's cupboard,
but not for a moment did she suspect
Ono of having depleted It. The de
tectives she employed were less trust
ful of Ono's profession of faith. When
they put him on the Inquisitorial grill
he squirmed until he was fairly cor
nered, and then he dropped on his
knees, opened his lachrymal glands
and made a complete confession. He
had stolen the silk and trimmings and
pawned them for a moiety of their
value with a Chinese money-lender.
The goods were recovered and restored
to their owner and Ono was booked for
grand larceny. Mrs. Steudeman did not
desire to prosecute Ono, because he
had been such a good Christian boy,
nor did Miss Louise E. Brown, who
lived in the house and heard his con
fession, seem eager to have him jailed.
The Judge, however, said the defend
ant's professed Christianity made his
ingratitude to Mrs. Steudeman all the
more reprehensible, and the sentence
imposed was aix months' imprisonment.
Ono's tear ducts fairly gushed as he
was led away.
Frank Brown and a blonde lady
friend of his were "joshed" by some

lost his temper and smashed a large

main hallway ceiling. Patrolman
Dowie, who made the arrest, said the
demolition was complete and pitiful,
and Judge Mogan continued the case
for one week in order to ascertain
whether Mr. Brown was really defend
ing his blonde lady friend from un
warranted insult when he accidentally
shattered the chandelier.
For stealing jewelry from the Cosmo

CHAMBER CALLS
GREAT MEETING
Hundreds of Merchants and
Shippers Are Asked to
Discuss Panama Matter
WILL IXFOKM BKISTOW
Federal Commissioner Will
See Representatives of
All Commercial Bodies
Fully fifteen hundred invitations
have been sent out by the commercial
organisations of this city to their
members to attend the meeting in the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce
this afternoon, where the Panama
Railroad and the Panama steamship
line and the questions relating to the
use to which the Federal Government
may put these lines will be discussed
before Commissioner J. L. Bristow.
The expectation is entertained that the
meeting will be the largest yet held in
the new building of the Merchants'
Exchange and that it will exceed in
interest any that has taken place in
this city in many years.
RATE SITUATION.
There are contending interests
among the parties most directly con
cerned. By means of an existing con
tract the transcontinental lines have
been able to control the rate situation
very completely for years, in fact
ever since the Panama road
and the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company resumed amicable
relations. Ten years ago these com
panies were at swords' points and the
merchants of San Francisco were oper
ating a line of steamships that they
subsidized in their own behalf and
connecting with the Panama road.
When the war was over the Panama
road and the Pacific Mail came to
gether again. The transcontinental
roads and their steamship connections,
which are acting together, do not wish
to have the Panama road thrown open
to the free use of the public without
discrimination. The Government now
owns the road and the Panama steam
ship line and has given notice of the
discontinuance of the existing contract
with the Pacific Mall. The Govern
ment must decide what to do with the
road very soon.
To what extent the commercial com
munity of San Francisco is united in
the hope that the Government may
operate the Panama road and steam
ship line for public use at equal rates
to all comers and that it may refrain
from entering into another exclusive
contract with any transportation inter
est may possibly be determined at
the meeting to-day. A strong party is
supposed to exist in favor of having
the Government take action as indi
cated in the foregoing.
MAY ASK QUESTIONS.
The meeting is not likely to go
through in accordance with any pre
arranged programme, if any such has
been prepared. Consequently it is
probable that in the discussion Com
missioner Bristow will learn much that
he desires to know at tirst hand from
the San Francisco people. Mr. Bris
tow may ask questions to develop all
the facts during the proceedings.
Yesterday Secretary Cadwalader of
the Chamber of Commerce sent out
hundreds of invitations to all the
members of the chamber and also re
quested the secretaries of the following
organizations to give notice to the
memberships of the bodies they repre
sent that the meeting will take place:
Shipowners' Association, Hardware
and Metal Association, Jobbers' and
Manufacturers' Association, San Fran
cisco Board of Trade, California State
Board of Trade, California Promotion
Committee, California Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association, Mer
chants' Exchange, Merchants' Asso
ciation and also the transportation
lines, prominent exports* and im
porters and leading capitalists and
leading real estate brokers and owners.
The meeting will be open to all.
Commissioner Bristow reiterated yes
terday that he hoped to get all the
information at San Francisco that he
can. The commercial bodies are doing
their best to assist him. Trustees
Dutton, Wheeler and Jennings of the
chamber made the final arrangements
yesterday as a committee.
FREIGHT WILL NOW GO
THROUGH TO TONOPAH
Southern Pacific Finally Relieves
Traffic Congestion on Lines to
.Mining Camps.
It has been announced by the
freight department of the Southern
Pacific Company that beginning to
morrow the Carson and Colorado
road will resume the receiving of all
kinds of freight for Tonopah, ex
cepting hay and lumber. This an
nouncement will be glad tidings to the
miners of the Nevada mining district.
It follows a trjff made by General
Manager Calvin and General Freight
Agent Luce to Nevada last week for
the purpose of clearing the blockade
that had existed there for a number of
months.
Manager Calvin was got slow in
appreciating the fact that immediate
action was necessary to provide the
mining district with facilities for get
ting machinery and food into that
section of the Sagebrush State, and in
twenty-four hours he had found a
â¢way of relieving the congestion that
had been retarding the progress of
mining development for several
months. The congestion became so
serious in December that the South
ern Pacific Company was compelled to
issue a notice to all its agents to re
fuse receiving freight for Tonopah,
and since then the company has been
busy hauling into thÂ« camp machin
ery and other freight that had been
accumulating along its lines between
Sacramento and Wadsworth. It is es
timated that nearly a million dol
lars' worth of freight is awaiting
shipment into Tonopah and Gold
fields.

WANTS TO CROSS KIVER
Application to Bridge the
Sacramento Referred to
the U. 8. Engineer's Office
Word has been received from Wash
ington, D. C, that the petition of the
Oakland and Marysville Railroad, re
cently incorporated, to build a bridge
from the Contra Costa to the Solano
County shores, across the Sacramento
River at Chipp Island, has been re
ferred by the War Department to the
United States Engineer s Office. The
communicating of the dispatch to the
Santa Fe oflice yesterday drew from
Assistant Traffic Manager Bissell the
admission that the Oakland and
Marysville Railroad is to be under the
management of the Santa Fe.
There were many rumors at the time
of incorporation of the Marysville road,
but nothing definite has been previous
ly divulged. The officials of the road
are also officials of the Santa Fe.
Captain Payson. assistant to the presi
dent of the Santa Fe. Is president of
the new road; Attorney Pillsbury. sec- '
retary, and Assistant Traffic Manager
Bissell and Chief Clerks Allberger and
Morton, directors.
Regarding the proposed bridge. Mr. '
Bissell said that the bridging of the
Sacramento at Chipp Island present
ed many advantages over the plan to
bridge at Carquinez. He maintained
that the point selected being above
Suisun Bay, there is less tidewater,
less interference with river traffic and
less liability of silt deposits. Another
advantage in the construction is that
the foundation will be of piers, not
piling, with steel superstructure and
capacious draw.
The Contra Costa end will be in the
vicinity of Black Diamond, the bridge
crossing the Sacramento to Chipp
Island and two other channels and Van
Sickle Island to the Solano County
shore, south of Bird's landing. From
there a road will be laid to Sacra
mento, but it will in no wise interfere
with the traffic over the Santa Fe's
main line.
Another proposition has been dis
cussed by the officials and will no doubt
be put into effect. That is the novelty
of allowing other roads the permission
to enter Oakland by way of the new
bridge. Providing a suitable under
standing is reached, no road will be
restricted from the use of the bridge,
and it is believed that the Western
Pacific is ready to take advantage of
the offer.

The Citizens' Alliance filed a suit
yesterday in the Justices' Court to re

The complaint avers that one of the
hacks belonging to the concern was
broken by rioters and the Board of
Supervisors has refused to pay the
claim. The complaint continues:
"The charter makes it the duty of
the Mayor, Chief of Police and Police
Commissioners to properly police the
city and protect property from mobs
and riots. Personal appeals were made
to the officials designated and they re
fused to prevent unprotected citizens
from being assatilted and beaten by

and Stablemen's Union, wb,o were on

COMPANY WILL
FINISH BRIDGE
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday listened to a large delega
tion of property owners and residents
of the Potrero, who petitioned that
the Santa Fe Railway Company com
plete the Nineteenth and Twentieth
street bridges on its right of way.
The property owners also protested
against the proposed removal of the
Nineteenth-street bridge, petitions
having been circulated to that effect.
Engineer W. P. Nicholson of the com
pany stated that the Nineteenth-street
bridge ftad been completed and used,
but it was necessary to take down one
of the end spans, owing to the disin
tegration of the earth on lowa street,
which was now being paved to pre
vent the water from draining through.
Nicholson said the company was not
responsible for the petitions to re
move the bridge and would resume
operations thereon when the sur
rounding land is fully protected. Nich
olson promised that the bridge would
be completed within six months. The
protestants claimed that lowa street
could not be fortified unless a retain
ing wall is built, as the land had been
undermined by blasting. After fur
ther discussion the promise made by
Nicholson was accepted as satisfactory.
Nicholson said that the Twentieth
street bridge must be completed be
fore 1907 under a $20,000 bond.
Several property owners appeared
before the ' committee to protest
against the granting of a spur track
permit to Rosenberg Bros. & Co. on
Japan street between Townsend and
Brannan. Attorney William Hum
phries, representing Mary J. Lennon,
who owns a bonded warehouse at the
corner of Japan and Townsend streets,
said that the spur track would inter
fere with the trucking of goods into
the warehouse by way of Japan street
and it was impossible to use the
Townsend-street side because It was
obstructed by cars standing on the
main tracks of the Southern Pacific
Company. It was stated that the spur
track would make it dangerous for
children in the vicinity. Mr. Rosen
berg said the track would only cross
Japan street into his warehouse and
not run along its entire length. The
committee took the matter under ad
visement and will notify all interested
parties when action on the permit
will be taken.
The recommendation of the Board
of Works that an available balance of
$15,000 be expended in grading and
macadamizing the northerly half of
H street from Twentieth to Twenty
eighth avenue and from Forty-fifth
avenue to the Great Highway was de
nied. The committee contended that
a sewer should be built under the
bond issue before any other improve
ment was carried out.
The committee recommended an
appropriation of $450 for a culvert to
drain a pool at Army and Kentucky
streets.
