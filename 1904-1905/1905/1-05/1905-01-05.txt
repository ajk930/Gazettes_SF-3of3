SWINDLE 'ON CITY
PORTLAND, Jan. 4.âGeorge H.
IWilllams, former Chief Justice of Ore
gon Territory, former United States
Senator from the State of Oregon,
Attorney General in President Grant's
second Cabinet, Mayor of Portland and
a man with the snow of eighty-three
winters upon his head, was indicted
by the Grand Jury of Multnomah
County to-day on the charge of mal
feasance in office. The indictment al
leges that on July 13. 1904, while
Judge Williams was Mayor of Port
land and acting in that capacity he re
fused to enforce the statures regulat
ing gambling. The law, which was
passed at the last session of the Legis
lature, gives the Mayor power to close
dif-orderly houses within four miles of
thi city and it is alleged that he failed
to avail himself'of That power.
An indictment against Chief of Po
lice Hunt is almost identical with that
returned against Mayor Williams,
charging" that he knowingly permitted
a gambling game to be conducted at
the Portland Club. Peter Grant and
Nathan Solomon are the proprietors
of the club. Solomon recently was
convicted of conducting a gambling
plsfre.
Indictments were also returned !
against TV. C. Elliott, recently deposed â 
as City Engineer; against his inspec
tors, J. M. Caywood and Henry Chand-
Xâ. and against E- W. and R- M.
Riner. contractors.
The indictments against Elliott, Cay- '
wood. Chandler and the Riners charge
obtaining money from the city by false
pretense* and are the result of the in
vestigation of the alleged Lanner
Creek sewer frauds. The indictment
recites that the contract was awarded
to the Riners by the executive board;
that the work was not done in accord
ance with the contract; that Caywood j
certified that it had been properly
done; that the report was approved by j
Elliott as City Engineer, and the work I
was accepted by the Executive Board, j
Other indictments returned by the j
(i r tnd Jury were against J. X. Flesh
man and M. G. Nease. managers of the
Warwick Club, a poolroom, for main
taining a nuisance.
General Williams gave tne following
statement concerning the indictment
against him:
'The indictment charges me with no
criminal offense. It simply accuses me
of not having instructed the Chief of
Police to do what was plainly his duty,
liy duties in regard to the suppression
cf gambling were clearly set forth by
the Supreme Coyrt of this State last
Winter when it was undertaken to com- j
pel rr.f to tiose the ga-nbling resorts in j
this city by means of a mandamus.
"In that decision the court held that
the eloping of gambling was plainly a
â¢ duty <>f the Chief of Pohce, to ba done
viihout instructions from me.
"Further than this I don't think that
any explanation is necessary."
STATE TO HAVE
TWO GOVERNORS
Democrats Decide to Have
Alva Adams Take Oath
of Office in Colorado
DENVER. Jan. 4.âNo action was
taken by the Legislature to-day looking
toward a settlement of the Gubernato
rial contest, and It is not likely that
anything in this direction will be un
dertaken at the first session to-mor
row.
When the Senate meets to-morrow an
attempt will be made to oust two Sen
ators. It requires a two-thirds vote to
deprive a member of his seat, and the
Republicans have but nineteen Sena
tors against f.fteen Democrats. The
plan most in favor to-night is to re
consider the vote by which they were
seated two years ago.
The Supreme Court this morning di
rected that an inquiry be made into
the conduct of the last election in this
city, and ordered that it assume the
scope asked by the Republicans. This
means that the Investigation shall not
only take in the ballot-boxes, but the
poll-books, registration slips and all
other matters pertaining to the elec
tion.
The application of Alva Adams for
a modification of the order, limiting: it
to the ballot-boxes only, was denied.
The order was. however, modified in
the matter of expense.
The Democrats have decided that on
January 10. the date prescribed by the
statutes, they will have Alva Adams
sworn in as Governor of the State.
The oath will be administered by Jus
tice Steele of the Supreme Court. The
hour and plate of the ceremony have
not been definitely settled. As Pea
body does not intend to surrender of
fice the State will have two Governors
tintil the case is finally decided.
There has so far been not the slight
est evidence of any disturbance, nor
has there been in any direction any
Indication of a breach of the Deace be
cause of the political situation.

Oxygen Used Suc

Physician.
Si>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 4.âChicago physi
cians soon will be called upon to hear
a technical paper on the use of oxygen
in pneumonia, prepared by Dr. H. J.
Burwash. So successful has been the
system of treatment adopted by Dr.
Burwash that he contemplates giving
to the profession all of the data that
has been gathered in a strenuous sea
son of practice
"Only recently I arrived at the bed
side of a patient who was blue and ap
parently nearly dead from pneumonia,"
said Dr. Burwash to-day. "The usual
plan of administering oxygen failed of
results. I sent gas into the body by
way of the bowels, and in three min
utes the skin glowed a healthy pink.
The organs Beemed to take up their
normal functions, the pulse"* became
steady and the lung cells began to per
form their ddties. The absorption, as
it were, of the oxygen by the viscera
was instantaneous.
"If I had not had such good results
from this way of administering oxygen
ir. severe cases of pneumonia I would
not be so positive in favoring it. But
if the pulmonary passages are clogged
and the patient gets little, If any, of
the oxygen into the lungs by the ordi
nary method of administering oxygen,
why not diffuse gas through the tissues
by the injection method? I have de
layed presenting this matter to the at
tention of my colleagues because of
professional activity."

PLANS WILL
BE CHANGED
Mrs Oelrichs Has Decided
That an Apartment House
on California Street Hill
Will Be Better Investment
TAKES ADVICE OF
THOMAS MAGEE JB.
Immediate Remodeling of
Hand r \e Structure Has
Been by Owner
Through Her Agent Here
Members of San Francisco's 400 who
have been looking pleasantly forward
to the functions that would have at
tended the opening, a year hence, of
the Fairmont Hotel, will never have
their happy expectations realized. Mrs.
Hermann Oelrichs has changed her
plans and abandoned the project for a
magnificent hostelry. In Its stead she
will open a swell apartment house on
the Nob Hill propertyâan establish
ment that will compare with anything
of its character in the world.
This anouncement was made at the
Palace Hotel last evening by Mrs.
Oelrichs* local representative, Thomas
Magee Jr., who has Just returned from
the East, where he conferred with
Mrs. Oelrichs concerning her interests
here and advised her to abandon her
plans for the Fairmont Hotel. Thomas
Magee's advice to his client was con
curred in by the architects of the
Fairmont and her brother-in-law and
sister, Mr. and Mrs. Vanderbilt, and
finally resulted in her complying with
their suggestion. Accordingly the
architect, who had been hurriedly sum
moned to New York, was instructed to
return immediately to San Francisco
for the purpose of altering the interior
platas of the structure.
In persuading Mrs. Oelrichs to accept
his views in the matter, Thomas Magee
Jr. clearly presented to her many facts
that go to show that a hotel on the
hill, isolated from the center of the
city as it would be and with the ex
pense that would be Incurred In fur
nishing it elaborately, together with the
possibilities of it falling into the hands
of T>oor managers, might prove to be
a disastrous financial investment.
Having "made this convincing argument
Thomas Magee Jr. was then called
upon to suggest a substitute for the
hotel and he promptly laid before his
client his ideas of an elegant apart-

CHICAGO, 5 an. 4.âMies Murial
Byram, 24 years old, of 2909 Michigan
avenue, a young woman well known
In society, was killed to-day by the ac
cidental discharge of a cartridge in a

Miss Byram was an heiress and one

most magnificent views in America and
charmingly located in one of the most
fashionable sections of San Francisco.
In two days' time Mrs. Oelrichs had
erased from her mind the thoughts of
her handsome hostelry and was eagerly
discussing with her adviser plans for
the apartment house. In confirming
the story of the proposed abandon
ment of the hotel project, Thomas
Magee Jr. said last night:
Mrs. Oelrichs haa acted most wisely and
probably saved many thousands of dollars.
Hhe now ahal#s with us tRe opinion that the
apartment house project ia more advisable than
that of a hotel, the success of which alwava
hinges upon so many things. Little change
will be necessary in the plans of the struc
ture to convert it into an apartment house,
for it waa originally planned so that It might
be remodeled. Tbe principal changes will be
made on the lower floors, where much space
has been allotted by the architects for hotel
lobbies, sitting and smoking rooms.
From now 'on work on the building; will be
hurried along as fast aa tha material can be
furnished, and the magnificent structure will
probably.be completed many months before the
time it was contemplated that a hotel couia
be made ready for occupancy.

Special Disratch to TtaÂ« CalL
GREAT FALLS, Mont.. Jan. 4.â W.
G. Conrad, one of the best known of
Montana millionaires, â¢is involved in
charges of land frauds in the Informa
tion imparted to Secretary of the In
terior Hitchcock, according to mes
sages received from Washington to
day. Startling allegations of fraud.
It is said, have been made to the effect
that immense tracts of tlm'oer and ag
ricultural land in Cascade and Mis
soula counties have been taken up and
patents secured througn- fraudulent
means. Perjured evidence, it is al
leged, was the principal method em
ployed. Patents, it is charged, were
secured to large tracts of desert land
northwest of Great Falls, title to which
has been transferred to W. G- Conrad.
An immense territory is included in
the transfer to Conrad, the lands be
ing embraced in a district Irrigated by
the Conrad irrigating duch. one of the
Largest individual irrigating projects
in the State.
According to information presented
to. the Interior Department about a
score of Indians took up timber claims
in Missoula County, which in turn were
turned over to prominent Missoula cit
izens, about twelve of the latter being
included in the charge of fraud.
Charges of wholesale frauds near
Libby, Flathead County-, ere made, it
bling alleged that the land companies
have swindled the Government out of
gigantic tracts. "Dummy" men and
women. It Is said, have played a large
part in tbe frauds practiced, wealthy
men of the State having obtained pos
session, of large tracts of mining lands
carrying*eopper. silver and gold ores.
Inspectors will be sent to Montana
at efnee to conduct a rigorous investiga
tion, which promises to be fruitful of
disclosures which, it is claimed, will
rival any hitherto made concerning
land frauds in the Northwest.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 4.âln connec
tion with the land fraud developments,
interest attaches to the Investigation c-f
alleged fraudulent desert land entries
in Montana on which special agents
have been engaged. Senator Gibson of
that State many months ago sent two
letters to the Commissioner of the Gen
eral Office, forwarding com
plaints of citizens that there were
frauds in this class of entries. Desert
land entries since then have been
rigidly investigated. The complaints
were that the lands entered were not
taken in good faith, were not being
irrigated and were not entered for cul
tivation purposes, as required by law.
It was stated at the General L<and
Office to-day that the complaints were
more general than specific, but that
cases c-f this sort have been under in
vestigation in Montana and elsewhere
for some months.

CLEVELAND. Ohio, Jan. 4.âLouis
Grossman, attorney for Receiver Na
than Loesser. to-day opened and made
a cursory examination of the contents
of the satchel belonging: to Mrs. Cas
sie L. Chadwick. which has been the
subject of much speculation. The
trunk belonging - to Mrs. Chadwick
will be opened to-morrow. According
to Grossman, the satchel, contained a
large number of documents and pa-'
pers of various kinds. Some jewelry
also- was found.
Mrs. Chadwick said to-day that a
formal statement relative to her af
fairs in financial transactions is in the
possession of a "private party" in
New York City and that it could not
be given to the public until Mrs. Chad
wick gave her consent. The instant
effect of her statement now held by
the "party" in New York, Mra Chad
wick said, would be to clear her of
all suspicion of alleged wrongdoing
and would show that she and her hus
band had been the victims of circum
stances and not of any crime of their
own commission.

gale early yesterday afternoon for her
official endurance trial of twenty-four
hours.
A k-owling nor'easter prevailed when
the Chattanooga went to sea and soon
a storm of sleet and snow oft
the coast. The storm lasted all night.
At the life saving station on the south
shore the velocity of wind was regis
tered at fifty miles an hour.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.âNot in several
years has New York been visited by a
storm of such proportions as that
which commenced yesterday and con
tinued until early to-day. Nine inches
of snow fell, paralysing traffic, and the
marked drop in the temperature
brought suffering to the city's poor.
The blizzard caused seven deaths in
New York and vicinity, while many
persons, overcome' by the cold, dropped
to the streets, some of them receiving
fractured bones.
Five of the men who met death from
the storm died from exposure; another
slipped on the icy platform of an ele
vated station, fell in front of an ap
proaching train and was ground to
pieces, while the seventh, L. W. Eller,
a conductor on the Pennsylvania Rail
road, blinded by the driven snow, step
ped in front or â¢ limited train at South

It is estimated that the storm will
cost the New York City Railway Com

The effects of the blizzard were felt
at most points along the New England

CHANGES URGED
FOR PRISONS
More Cells, a Reformatory
For First Offenders and
Wall at Folsom Suggested
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 4.âThe report
of the State Board of Charities and
Corrections made public to-day again
calls attention to the overcrowded con
ditions of the prisons at San Quentln
and Folsom. The report in this con
nection quotes as follows from a report
made twenty-four years ago:
Tills doubling up or congregating ot pris
oners we regard as one of the great evils of
our system. It renders classification simply
Impossible. It necessarily brings the younger
and lest, criminal classes in dally contact and
association with the vilest and meat degraded
elements of criminal life, thereby destroying
more effectually any good qualities l that may
remain, without in the slightest degree re
deeming the utterly vicious. This sort of as
sociation is doubtless the causj of hundreds
of returns to prison, and of course the com
mission of hundreds of crimes.
It is stated that this assertion is ap
plicable at the present date. It is the
opinion of the board that California
should have a reformatory for first of
fenders modeled after the best institu
tions of that kind in other States.
The report recommends that addi
tional cells be built at once and favors
some form of severe punishment for
troublesome prisoners, such as the
straitjacket. It adds:
It is our beat Judgment that a law should be
passed by the next legislature providing that
no prisoner shall be confined in the straitjacket
in any Â«*Â»e for a longer period than four hours
consecuUvely without an opportunity to rest
for a length of two hours. So that there may
be no danger of injury from over-severity of
the punishment the prison physician should be
required by rule of the prison directors to ex
amine the prisoner before the application of
the straitjacket (as Is now done) and to see
the Ja<eket applied each time It is pat on and
to certify over his signature In the punishment
book that the placing was properly done so aa
not to cause injury.
Attention is called to the need of a
wail at Folsom.

Invade Chamber to Pro

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 4.âWalter Par
ker of Los Angeles. Herrln's accredited
agent, who is aiding Jere Burke, Johnny
Lynch and Johnny McKenzie in pro
moting the interests of Frank H. Flint
for United States Senator, invaded the
Senate chamber this morning and fur
nished the principal topic of conversa
tion. There was little to be done at
the morning session of the upper house
so Parker was. not annoyed in his but
tonholing occupation by arguments
over bills or other questions, and en
joyed a free field.
To the right and to the left and be
tween Senators he seated himself and
bent the weight of his Influence wher
ever he could get an ear. An inter
ested group of Senators stood by the
President's desk watching Parker as
he did politics.
"Pretty raw, isn't it?" said one of the
group. "The last time we had a sena
torial fight here this kind of work was
done midst the luxury of a private car
side-tracked down in the repair yards.
They feel a little bolder this time, how
ever, and it wouldn't surprise me much
to see one of the third house take the
President's seal before the game is
over and direct affairs from that point
of vantage. However, it may be that
Parker is just rounding up things In
a hurry, because I hear the third house
expects an order any minute that it is
j best that it adjourn sine die and light
out for San Francisco."
CODES FOR THE MEMBERS.
When the Senate convened this
morning resolutions were introduced
providing for the supplying of the
members with codes, stamps, station

tee appointed to pass on the resolution
presented by Woodward, providing that
all bills presented amendatory of other
acts shall have the new portion under

recommended that the resolution be

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 4.âThe devel
opment of strength in the camp of
Postmaster Arthur Flsk causes no end
â of comment at the headquarters of the
other aspirants for the honor which
"the Legislature is about to confer. At
â¢ "the outset little attention was paid to
â¢ the introduction of Fisk's candidacy.
â¢ tho popular impression being that it
signified simply that the desire of a
few members to rind a roosting-olace
â¢ for several ballots.
' Now it is suspected that the clever
. .h-and of the senior Senator, George
' C. Perkins, is deftly eliminating from
the general bunch a block of votes
that may be thrown to either Bard or
.-.Flint in the event of any formidable
4evelopment of strength in favor of
Knigh.'s candidacy. Some of the
.v isest onlookers are coming to the be
lie t that the Southern Pacific is mold
ing thr sold brick for Flint and fitting
! the toga for Knight. It is asserted
that George Hatton, who, at the open
. in>j of the campaign, undertook the
â¢labor of guiding Oxnard's political
bark through the shoals of opposition,
is now full Hedged manager of Ar
thur Fisk's campaign.
. Hatton, on behalf of Flsk. is quietly
rounding up the legislators that are
known as Perkins sympathizersâmen
th,:; have supported Perkins in the
pact, that are now enjoying his favors
and hope in the future to aid him in
attaining his ambitions, and to bask
in the future in the sunshine of his
generosity.
These friends of Senator Perkins per
ceive the danger that lurks ahead for
their favorite statesman, should a man
from the north place the toga in his
trunk and whisk away for Washing
ton.
Th. j y want a southern man. and if
', they tir.d a legislator that will promise
no sunport to either Bard or Flint they
are not loth to discuss the merits of
EE. E. Huntington, to recite the ser
vices ni D. S. Grant or to casually re
fer to the availability of Henry T.
(rttgp. Any man from the south seems
. tt) suit when they are talking to a. man
that waves his arms at mention of
Flint or Bard. They want a man from
the south, that Perkins will have no
question of â¢ political equilibrium to
face four years hence.
They want things wide open in the
north four years from now, and, in
conclusion, it may be said that Metcalf
would like tt see things wide open in
tile north when that time comes and
that even our good Governor would
shudder we're he to contemplate the po
litical doors of the north closed by the
clamoring south.
The open door in the north is what
is wanted and every energy is being
bent to see that that of the south ia
closed with a bang when the name of

ject to the measure because they have
arrived with their pockets bulging with
bills already prepared for presentation,
and they complain that if the resolu
tion is adopted they must do their work
all over again. However, the advan
tages to be gained by the Senate as
a whole, if the resolution is carried,
probably will result in the overruling
of the objections that have been raised
and the adoption of the resolution.
When the Senate reconvened at 'S
o'clock this afternoon Woodward's res
olution came up in a new form con
tained in a resolution presented by Lu
kens, the object being to force a vote.
The effort failed, however, and the res
olution will not go to a vote until to
morrow, at which time sample bills, to
be prepared by State Printer Shannon,
will be on hand for inspection. This
question disposed of, the report of the
Committee on Mileage was presented
and adopted, the sums allowed the Sen
ators ranging from 20 cents up to
$116 40, the latter sum being drawn by
Ward of Chula Vista. .Resolutions pro

ATTACHES ARE'NAMED.
A resolution providing- for the pur
chase of ten desks for the use of
stenographers met with objection from
Kelshaw, who wanted to know what
had become of the desks purchased two
years ago. An investigation failed to
trace the old desks, however, and Bel
shaw's effort at economy was defeated.
Then the amusing incident of the ses
sion occurred. The attaches that had
just been appointed were ordered to
assemble at the desk to take the oath.
The alacrity with which this order was
cbtyed was'surprising to behold. The
attaches swarmed down the aisle in
droves. The aisles filled, the attaches
overflowed between the desks, disar
ranging the carefully smoothed coif
fures of the Senators and treading on
their toes.
"I move," said Belshaw, jumping to
his feet, "that the Senate adjourn to
the hall to give the attaches room to
get into the Senate chamoer."
Shouts and laughter greeted this mo
tion, but before it could be taken up
seriously the oath had been adminis
tered to the small army of employes
and they filed out. A motion to ad
journ till to-morrow morning at 11
o'clock was then put and carried.

JURISTS REST
UNDER CHARGES
Impeachment Proceedings to
Be Brought Against Two
Judges of Superior Court
SEKIOUS ALLEGATIONS
Torrance of San Diego and
Smith of Santa Cruz Will
Be Summoned by Senate
a
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 4.âSuperior
Court Judges Lucas Flattery Smith
of Santa Cruz County and E. S. Tor
rance of San Diego must defend them
selves inÂ« impeachment proceedings be
fore the Senate. That impeachment
proceedings would be brought against
Judge Torrance has been the general
impression for some months, but the
fact that Judge Smith occupied an
equally unenviable position came as a
surprise to-day when Attorney J. H.
Leonard arrived from Santa Crur and
placed specific charges against the
Jurist in the hands of Assemblyman
George C. Cleveland of Watsonville for
presentation.
Under the law impeachment proceed
ings must originate in the House, but
the trial of the accused will be held in
the Senate. In his specifications
against Judge Smith Attorney Leonard
makes charges substantially as fol
lows: That Judge Smith has been
guilty of great partiality and favorit
ism to one Charles M. Cassin, an at
torney of his court, the partiality be
ins manifested to such a degree that
it has created a general impression
that to succeed In litigation before
Judse Smith it is necessary to employ
Attorney Cassin; that Judge Smith
told Peter P. Hartman, a litigant, that
he should have employed Cassin and
was very unfortunate in having re
tained other counsel, for he (Judge
Smith) would be more than human if
he did not let his personal prejudice
guide his decisions; that on one occa
sion Judge Smith permitted Cassin to
assault a litigant, one Thomas Dakan,
in open court without reprimand, but
punished Dakan for defending himself.
FAVORED A PRISONER.
It is further charged that Judge
Smith interested himself on behalf of
one Nathan Smith who had been con
victed of an assault with a deadly
weapon, caused Smith's attorney,
George B. Fletcher, to procure a peti
tion of good character for him. and
then, under authority of this petition,
prepared after Smith had been convict
ed, sentenced him to the lightest pun
ishment permitted by the* law: that
Judge Smith advised Attorney Leon
ard during the trial of the case of Nich
olas Sambuck against the Southern Pa
cific to permit the railroad physicians
to examine Sambuck, who had been in
jured and was suing for damages, and
to have Sambuck bend and squeal
when the doctors touched him: that
during the trial of the case of Dolores
Ramirez against the Big Creek Pow
er Company Attorney Leonard was
informed by one Harry W. Rich that
J. V. Gregory, one of the Jurors in the
case, had expressed his intention toÂ»ao
proach the defendant corporation for
payment for his verdict; that such in
formation was placed before Judge
Smith, but he refused to consider it.
informed the Juror that he did not be
lieve the statement, called Rich before
him and treated him in a tyrannical
manner, subsequently filing an instru
ment in which he stated that the iuror
was not guilty of any corruption, and
this, after having stated to one J. M.
J. Majors that Gregory should be pros
ecuted tor his conduct. In this litiga
tion the corporation was represented
by Attorney Cassin.
Continuing, the complaint says that
after one Louis Buelna had been con
victed *of a statutory crime in Judge
Smith's court the Judge went to the
prisoner's mother, Frances Buelna, and
told her to inform the boy that if he
would not seek a new trial he would
sentence the lad very lightly, this
action, it is alleged, being taken to put
the boy in a position where he could
not perfect hiÃ appeal; that Judge
Smith, for the purpose of preventing a
proper investigation into his own
conduct, appointed a friend of the Big
Creek Power Company as foreman of
the Grand Jury.
GUILTY OF OPPRESSION.
Another charge is that Judge Smith
has been guilty of oppression and
i tyranny In his office, incorrectly and
oppressively, and without just cause
imprisoning one P. E. Zabala and one
J. J. Wyatt upon feigned, fictitious and
false charges of contempt of court;
that Judge Smith through Ignorance,
incompetency and corruption has
wrongfully decided a great percentage
of the cases in his court as evidenced
by the fact that about 50 per cent of
the civil cases and 75 per cent of the
criminal cases tried before him have
been reversed by the Supreme Court at
great expense to the litigants and to
the people of the State of California;
and in conclusion that Judge Smith,
arbi'-arily and of his own motion and
without notice, struck from the files of
his court the complaint in the case of
Helen Younger against Charles Moore,
Judge Smith being a party litigant to
the action.
WILL PRESS THE CHARGES.
Attorney Leonard was accompanied
here to press the charges by Mr. Rich,
his principal witness in the alleged de
velopments of corruption in the Big
Creek Power Company case. The speci
fied charges were placed in the hands i
of Assemblyman Cleveland and he will!
present them for the action of the
Legislature early next week.
No specified charges have as yet been
filed against Judge Torrance, but it
Mas stated by a member of the Los
Angeles delegation this evening that
they would be prepared probably next
week.
"I have been asked to present the
matter," he said, "but as I am in the
Senate I cannot do this. The im
peachment proceedings must originate
in the House. The charges against
Judge Torrance are serious and pri-Â«
marily involve Improper conduct in the
Gay divorce proceedings in which it
was charged that during the hearing
of the case by Judge Torrance he went
tq the Gay home and questioned var
ious witnesses and looked over the
premises to the prejudice of one of the
parties and this without the knowledge
of the attorneys of the parties thus
prejudiced. Other charges seriously re
flecting updn Judge Torrance will be
included in the specifications and it
was only to-day that I was informed
that several prominent attorneys of
Los Ang&ies are preparing the case
against him. which will undoubtedly
lead to a sensational trial before the
fcenate." Â»
NORTHERN LEGISLATORS
MAY DECIDE TO CAUCUS
Senatorial Fight an Open One
Los Angeles Sends a Large Delega
tion to Help Flint's Boom.
Special Dispatch to â¢he Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 4.âThe aban
donment of the efTorts of the Flint
men to secure a caucus is significant.
Goodrich's soundings of the house hav
ing met with such a rebuff, especially
on the part of San Francisco members,
it is not likely that it will be renewed.
The strong objection of the San Fran
cisco legislators to a caucus is full of
significance for the men of the south,
and does not give them the most cheer
ful feellngÃ. It has been tacitly de
cided that there will be no caucus. The
members of the two houses will be free
on the opening of the balloting to vote
their own personal preferences and
pledges.
The failure to get a caucus shows
that Flint has not the strength he has
been claiming and makes the fight "A
free for all affair," the friends of the
other candidates say.
George A. McGowan, the young
leader and chairman of the San Fran
cisco Assembly delegation, hints at a
northern caucus in case the south fails
to center on a man.
"If the south can center its undivided
support on some one who is satisfac
tory to us," he said, "we will support
him with at least sixteen and maybe
eighteen votes. I will not say whether
any of the southern men already in'
the fight would be satisfactory to us.
If an agreement Is not reached by the
southerners, H*- north may hold a
caucus and its choice will be either
Knight or Fisk. If there is a northern
caucus there will be enough votes pres
ent to assure the election of the man
decided on."
As is believed by some of the legis
lators from above Tehachapi that
KNOX AGAIN TO HEAD
FEDERATION OF LABOR
Spirited Contest Develops for' Posi
tion of Secretary-Treasurer of
State Body.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 4.âAt the after
noon session of the State Federation of
Labor a dis -. ion took r-ace as to
whether the constitution should be so
amended as to Increase the vice presi
dents from seven to nine. The original
number of vice presidents was five,
but at yesterday's session the number
was increased to seven by a constitu
tional amendment. The proposition
was lost by an overwhelming vote.
The erection will be held to-morrow
morning. Harry A. Knox of San Fran
cisco was renominated for the presi
dency of the organization with no op
position. Opposition to Secretary-
Treasurer George B. Benham of San
Francisco developed when Frank J.
Bonnington. also of San Francisco, was
placed in nomination. The contest for
this office Is regarded as close.
Another spirited contest Is that for
the office of State organizer, now filled
by F. C. Wheeler of Los Angeles, who
is a candidate for re-election. Many of
the delegates are supporting George K.
Smith of Oakland.
The nominations for vice presidents
were as follows: First vice president,
Thomas Gallagher of Oakland, with no
opponent; second vice president, Thom
as F. Lonergan of San Francisco and
N. Blum of San Francisco; third vice
president. D. D- Sullivan of Sacra
mento and W. D. McWayne of San
Francisco; fourth vice president, J. R.
Hillis of San Jose and J. P. B. Jones of
San Francisco; fifth vice president, C.
W. Hohnquist of San D:ego, with no
opponent; sixth vice president, J. C.
Templeton of Fresno, A. C. Conors of
Santa Rosa, Edward Galiimore of Val
lejo; seventh vice president, John
Guinne of San Francisco and Edward
Clyde of Eureka.
At to-day's session consideration was
given to a proposed constitutional
amendment providing that no person
shall hold office in the federation who
holds a paid political position, elective
or appointive. The amendment was
lost.
To-night the delegates were given a
grand ball at Turner Hall by the Sac
ramento committee of arrangements
and to-morrow afternoon they will be
shown all the points of interest in the
city.

Flint's headquarters to-night was
filled with Lot Angeles business men
who came to aid his candidacy ana
more are expected on various trains.
1 he purpose is to show that the candi
date is not lacking in the support of
his home people. Among those gath
ered at his rooms to-night were L. V.
Youngworth, County Surveyor of Los
Angeles; Oscar Lawlor, attorney; John
Mott, attorney; J. Washburn, bank
president; John Burr, ex-Sheriff; Wil
lis Booth, factory manager; William
Ball; Leon I*. Moss, attorney; Charles
B. Mahone, Dr. Balch and C. L. Par
ker.
Among those expected to arrive are
Isidore B. Dockweiler, Democratic pol
itician; W. C. Patterson, bank presi
dent, and John Slauson, banker and
attorney. The efforts of these gentle
men are to show that Flint has the
support of the commercial interests of
his section, and their enthusiasm
gives life to the headquarters. They
are not going to hold a parade, but
they'll, poee as long as their man has
a chance. They claim 'for him that he
j could depopulate the city of Los An
geles by sending down a telegram that
he needed the support of the people.
One of the stories the anti-Bard men
from the south are circulating about
Senator Bard is that he is 63 years of
age and in broken health.
The Bard men reply: "The Senator
is two years younger than Senator
Perkins and an upright life and the
salubrious air of Ventura have given
him a physique and an excellent qual
ity of health that many a younger man
may envy."
Arthur Flsk suddenly changed his
mind and did not return to San Fran
cisco to-day as he had intended. His
remaining here caused some more spec
ulation.. He says he will not go to
the bay city until Friday night and
that he will be back Monday. He claims
to be gaining votes.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in' Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
â¢ few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans
ing puroose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
â¢Is In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
axe composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal, and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The dally use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of It is, that no poeaible
harm can result from their continued
use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stom
ach and bowels, and to clear the com
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat; I also believe the liver is
sreatly benefited by the daily use of
them: they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
.â¢get more and better charcoal In Stuart's
< harcoal Lozenges than In any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

Lawson in an answer filed to-day in
the Supreme Judicial Court in the suit
brought by Paul Fuller of New York
to recover on an alleged contract to
purchase stock of the Kern Incan

SPECIAL BOARD
OVER TRUSTS
Senator Heyburn Introduces
a Bill Providing for a
National Body of Control
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.âA national
board to exercise supervision and con
trol over corporations is provided for
in a bill Introduced in the Senate to
day by Senator Heyburn. It Is pro
posed that Congress create a new de
partment of the Government to exist
in connection with the Department of
Commerce and Labor, to be known as
"The National Board of Corporations."
This board shall consist of five persons,
four to be nominated by the President,
for terms of four years each at salaries
of $5000 annually, and the fifth mem
ber shall be the Secretary of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor.
Authority far greater than that en
joyed by the department now intrust
ed with the regulation of trusts and mo
nopolies will be given to the National
Board of Corporations, if Senator Hey
burn's bill becomes a law. The bill pro
vides that the board shall have the
power to compel the production of all
books or documents, or the attendance
of witnesses necessary to the investiga
tion of any question affecting the right
of a corporation to engage in business.
Under the provisions of the bill no
corporation would be permitted to en- :
gage in business in any State other
than that In which it is Incorporated !
unless sufficient proof is first â¢submitted j
to the national board that such cor
poration is Incorporated for a legiti
mate purpose; that it Is solvent; that |
it is not a party to any agreement to
operate in restraint of trade or com
merce or which results in giving to it
or any person or corporation engaged
in like trade an unfair advantage over
others; that it is not a party to any
pooling plan which when carried into
effect would create a monopoly of the
trade or business In which such cor- j
poration or corporations are engaged;
that no voting pool exists by which the
full and free right to vote the stock
of the corporation by the actual owners j
of such stock is abridged or prevented, !
and that no part of the capital stock
of such corporation shall be controlled, i
owned or voted by any other corpora- I
tion.

SUBSIDIES
IN AID OF
SHIPPING
Commission Reports a Bill
of Wide Range Intended
to Build Up the Merchant
Marine of the Country
TONNAGE AND MAIL
SUBVENTIONS URGED
Measure Also Provides for
a Tax on Foreign Vessels
Entering Our Ports and
a Naval Volunteer Service
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.âSubventions
of $5 per gross ton annually; subsidies
for the carrying of mails from-Atlan
tic coast and Gulf of Mexico ports to
South and Central America and Cuba,
and from Pacific Coast ports to Japan,
China, the Philippines, Mexico, Cen
tral America and the Isthmus of Pan
ama; a tonnage tax on foreign vessels
entering United States ports; the crea
tion of a naval volunteer service, and
the encouragement of apprentices on
ships in foreign trade are provided for
in a bill agreed upon by the joint mer
chant and marine commission, which
submitted its report to Congress to
day.
The bill agreed upon is divided into
eleven sections. The first makes pro
vision for creating a force of naval vol
unteers capable of rendering service in
time of war. It provides that the Sec
retary of the Navy and the Secretary
;of Commerce and Labor should cause
to be made an enrollment of officers
and men, now and hereafter employed
;in the merchant marine and deep sea
fisheries of the United States, who shall
receive an annual retainer at the end
of each year.
TONNAGE SUBVENTION.
The second section provides for a
subsidy after July 1, 1906, of (a) the
sum of $5 per gross registered ton for
each vessel which has been engaged in
the foreign trade by sea or the deep
sea fisheries for a period of twelve
months, including time necessarily
consumed In maikng annual or extraor
dinary repairs; (b )the sum of $4 per
gross registered ton for each vessel
which has been engaged in the foreign
trade by sea or the deep sea fisheries
for a period of nine months or over,
but less than twelve months, including
time necessarily consumed in making
extraordinary repairs; <c) the sum of
52 BO per gross registered ton for each
vessel which has been engaged in the
. foreign trade by sea or the deep sea
fisheries for a period If six months or
over, but less than nine months, includ
ing time necessarily consumed in mak
ing extraordinary repairs.
Provision is made in the third sec
tion that vessels receiving the sub
vention may be taken by the United
States, at a fair compensation, for
national defense or any public purpose.
It provides also that when the Post
master General requires the vessels
shall carry mails free of charge; that
one-sixth of the crews shall be citi
zens of the United States; and that
when possible repairs be made in the
United States.
The fourth section provides "that the
contracts provided for in section three
shall be for a period of one year, and
shall be renewed from time to time,
but np vessel shall receive a subvention
under the provisions of this act for a
longer period than ten years."
Sections five and six authorize and
direct the Postmaster General to enter
into contracts, for not less than five
nor more than ten years, for the carry
ing of mails In steamships built and
registered in the United States, be
tween ports of the United States and
foreign ports.
AS TO MAIL CONTRACTS.
Rates affecting the Pacific Coast are
as follows: Pacific Coast ports, via
Hawaii, to Japan, China and the Phil
ippines, sixteen knots speed, monthly
service, $300,000; fortnightly, $600,000;
Pacific Coast port to Japan, China and
the Philippines, thirteen knots speed,
monthly service. $210,000; fortnightly,
$420,000; Pacific Coast port to Mexico,
Central America and the Isthmus of
Panama, twelve knots speed, fort
nightly service, $120,000.
The same requirement, as to the en
rollment of naval volunteers, is made of
steamships obtaining such mail con
tracts as Is exacted of vessels obtaining
subvention.
The tonnage tax on foreign vessels
entered in United States ports is pro
vided for in section eight, as follows:
That a duty of 8 cents per net ton, not to
exceed In the aggregate 80 cents per net ton
In any one year Is hereby Imposed at each en
try by sea on all vessels which shall be entered
In any port of the United States from any for
eign port or place In North America, Central
America, the West India Islands, the Bahama
Islands, the Bermuda Islands, the coast of
South America bordering on the Caribbean Sea.
or Newfoundland; and a duty ot 16 cents per
net ton, not to exceed in the aggregate $1 60
per net ton In any one year, Is hereby Imposed
at each entry by sea on all vessels which shall
be entered In any port of the United States
from any other foreign port or place, not, how
sver, to Inciuds the vessels In distress or not
engaged In trade.
APPRENTICE BENEFITS.
Section 9 relates to apprentices and
provides the following:
That on proof to the satisfaction of the Com
missioner of Navigation that a vessel of the
United States has on any foreign voyage car
ried a boy or boys, a citizen or citizens of the
United States, under 21 years of age. suitably
trained during that voyage In seamanship or
engineering. In the proportion of one for such
vessel, and in addition cms for each thousand
tons of her net registered tonnage, there shall
be paid to the owner or owners of the vessel,
out of any money in the Treasury not other
wise appropriated, an allowance equivalent to
80 per centum of the tonnage duties paid In
respect of the entry In the United States of
that vessel from that voyage. Such payment
shall not be made after July-1, 1907, except in
respect of any boy who Is enrolled In the naral
volunteers, or Is an apprentice indentured in
accordance with law. â¢
Section 10 repeals all conflicting acts
and section 11 fixes July 1, 1905, as the
time the proposed legislation shall
take effect.
GREAT SAVING POSSIBLE
An adequate American ocean fleet,
the commission says, would mean the
saving to this country of $100,000,000
a year, which now goes to build up the
commercial power and naval strength
of Europe and Asia.
It is strongly emphasized by the
commission that the naval subventions
offered In the proposed bill are not
bounties outright or mere commercial
subsidies, but are distinctly based on
important public services to be given
by the ships and ship-owners that re
ceive them.
In the proposed bill not one dollar
is added to thÂ© expenditures for any
one of the five established contract
ocean mail lines. The present ocean
mall act is not amended except as to
certain specific new routes to be estab
lished and the new requirement as to
| naval volunteers.

BEEF COMBINE
Argues Before the Supreme
Court of Nation That It Is

OPPRESSIVE CONTROL
Attorney General Declares
That a Clear Case of Con
spiracy Has Been Shown
WASHINGTON; Jan. 4.âThe brief
of the Government in the case of
Swift & Co. vs. the United States,
known as the beef trust case, pre
pared by Attorney General Moody,
was presented to the Supreme Court
of the United States to-day. The
brief is devoted principally to an ar
gument to show that the packers are
engaged in a conspiracy to monopo
lize interstate commerce in fresh
meats. The Attorney General says:
It may be remarked that Judges hare dif
fered ac to the validity ot aggregations of
capital effected by some forme of organic
union between several smaller and competing
corporations," and economists are far from
agreed that such aggregations, within limita
tions, are hurtful. So, too. associations of
manufacturers to regulate competition within
a restricted area have not always been con
demned by courts and have sometimes been
approved by publicists. But has a responsible
voice yet been heard to Justify, legally or eco
nomically, a conspiracy or agreement between
nearly all the producers of a commodity neces
sary to life by which the confederates acquire
absolute control and dominion over the pro
duction, sals and distribution of that com
modity throughout the entire territory of a
nation, with the power at will to raise prices
to the consumer of the finished product and
lower prices to the producer of the raw ma
terial? Yet such is the case now at the bar
of this court.
That there is a conspiracy to control the
market of the nation for fresh meats that It
does control it. and that its control Is merci
less and oppressive, are facts known of all
men. The broad question here is, does the
Government's petition with its statements of
fact, standing unchallenged, discover that con
spiracy to the court? We submit that it does
and that the decree of the civil court should
In all things be affirmed.

ROMANTIC COURTSHIP
ENDS IN A DIVORCE
Mrs. Gertrude McCanley, a Former

CHICAGO, Jan. 4.âMarried after a
romantic courtship in a cottage at At
lantic City, at the height of the sum
mer season five years ago, Mrs. Ger
trude McCauley, a former society girl
of Denver and Colorado Springs, was
to-day granted a divorce from Thomas
B. McCauley by Judge Honore. Mc-
Cauley, who is said to be in Texas,
made no defense to the charge of cru
elty, upon which the suit was based.
Charles H. White of Colorado Springs,
father of the complainant, testified in
her behalf.
It was related in court that Mc-
Cauley is the son of a woman who at
tained much notoriety in Chicago four
years ago, being sued by Jewelers and
merchants for bills aggregating $30,

that thia Government Is directly and
powerfully contributing to the decline
of American merchant shipping on the
Pacific Ocean. Issue is taken with the
War Department on the question as to
whether a saving to the Government
has resulted from the operation In
time of peace of lines of foreign-built
craft. In this connection the report
J says:
To ail th* members of the commission who
visited th* Pacific Coast this procedure of the
War Department appeared to be absolutely in
defensible. It Is true that In his recent an
nual report the quartermaster general of the
army figures out a profit of $398,238 for the
transport service as compared with the rates
which commercial steamers would have
charged, but this profit, as a matter of fact.
Is altogether due to a radical difference in
bookkeeping methods between commercial
steamship companies and the quartermaster's
department.
Discontinuance of the transport ser
vice, as a measure of economy and a
sure and acceptable encouragement to
American trade and navigation on the
Pacific Ocean, is urged by the com
mission.

THIS SESSION
â  Opposition Prepared to Keep
Measure From Reaching a
Vote l>y Filibustering
>
Special DUpatch to Tha Call.
CALL. BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
' WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.âlt la safe to
I say that the statehood bill, given the
; right of way in the Senate to-day, will
I not pass at this session. The Demo-
I crats are united against it and show
an intention to filibuster. Senator Tel
! ler in an interview to-night said flatly
I that the bill would not be allowed to
come to a vote. Senator Foraker, who
: introduced an amendment, which re
quires a majority vote of both Arizona
; and New Mexico to r. ake the law op
! erative, also stated in an interview
! that the bill wonld never pass in its
present shape. Teller's opposition to
| the bill would probably be withdrawn
;if Foraker's amendment prevails. Sen
j ator Bard will make a speech against
the bill to-morrow.
Upon reconvening to-dayÂ«after the
; holiday recess the Senate plunged di
! rectly into the consideration of the
! statehood bill. The reading of the bill
| being concluded, Bate moved to re-
I commit that measure because the tes-
I timony taken before the Committee on
I Territories had not been reported, ren-
I dering it difficult to make a minority
j report. He pleaded against undue
i haste in the matter and argued against
the consolidation of the four Territo
ries into two States.
Referring to the proposed union of
Arizona and New Mexico, he eaid they
would make a State of greater area
than is comprised in all the New Eng
i land States, with New York, New Jer-
I sey and Pennsylvania added. The only
| reason for the consolidation was found,
|he said, in the desire to prevent an In
crease of United States Senators.
Bate's motion was voted down, 15 to
j 31, Heyburn voting with the Democrats
for recommittal.
Nelson supported the bill as reported
|by the committee. Referring especially
I to the Territories of Oklahoma and In
dian Territory, he said they were so
constituted as to be the complement
each of the other. Nelson had not con
cluded, when on motion of Cullom
the Senate at 4:16 p. m. adjourned out
of respect to the memory of Represen
tative Mahoney of Illinois.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
INCUBATOR BABY FEELS
BETTER FOR TREATMENT
â¦
Doctor Cfaii Pleased With Progress Little One Is Ming
STRANGE EXPERIMENT SAVES THE LIFE OF CHILD
OAKLAND, Jan. 4.âTo Doctor W.
A. Clark, superintendent of the Ala
meda County Infirmary, belongs the
distinction of having been the first
physician who has ever used a chicken
incubator for the purpose of maturing
en infant. Thus far his experiment
has proved successful. The infant Is
now in its second week of incubator
life and is apparently thriving.
The baby is the child of Elsie
Wells of 5023 Morton street, Alameda,
and was born on Friday, December 23,
and was so feeble at birth that Doctor
Clark feared the little one would not
live.
Then Doctor Clark commenced to
put hia wits to work. He thought of
the chicken incubator that had long
been used at the infirmary chicken
yard and he forthwith ordered it
brought to the ward.
Tucked cozily away in tiny blankets
with the regulated heat from the in
cubator lamp warming it to its little
bones, the baby commenced to im
prove. It opened its bright little eyes
and smiled and cooed approvingly.
Days passed and life grew stronger in
the baby. Its food was digested well
Und it seemed to enjoy the narrow con
. fines of its queer living place.' Doctor
Clark was pleased and he knew his
experiment was a success.
"When the baby was born," said the
doctor, "it was so feeble that I saw
at once that artificial means must be
used to preserve its life. I was deplor
ing the fact that we did not have a
regular infant incubator at hand, when
the thought came to me that perhaps
one of the ordinary kind might an
swer. I knew that the life of the
child could not be saved except by the
use of an incubator, and rather than
have the baby die for lack of a trial, I
decided to make the experiment.
"The infant at the time of its birth
weighed about two pounds. Now it
weighs three, and appears to be doing
fairly well. Of course there are many
chances against saving the child, but
at least my experiment has demon
strated that an ordinary Incubator
may be used in an extreme case."
HEALTH BOARD TO PROHIBIT
BARBERS' POWDER PUFFS
New Ordinance Is Intended to Prevent
Spread of Disease Through Care
lessness in Shaving Shops.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 4. âPowder puffs,
spenges and stick alum will not be
permitted to be used in local barber
shops if a new ordinance prepared by
the Board of Health for the regulation
of tonsorial establishments is passed
by the City Trustees. Under the same
measure no barber will be allowed to
prescribe for or treat any skin disease
unless he is a regularly licensed physi
cian. Every wielder of the razor and
scissors will also be required to wash
his handÃ with hot water and soap
after each shave and hair clip and
Sterilise his instruments.
Details of the proposed ordinance
vere discussed by the City Board of
Health last night and it was the gen
eral sentiment that the rules govern
ing local barber shops should be more
stringent. With a few exceptions the
projected enactment will contain the
stipulations to be found in the ton
sorial sanitary code in effect in the
city of New York.

Judgment Is Given Against
the Dunsmuir Estate for
$13,000 and Costs of Suit
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 4.
The estate of the late Josephine
Dunsmuir must settle with E. Hold
away & Co. of St. Louis for $13,000
worth of books she bought shortly be
fore her death. Judge Ellsworth ren
dered a decision for this amount
against Charles H. Lovell as executor
of the estate. The claim was not al
lowed by Lovell on the ground that
the charge was excessive and that Mrs.
Dunsmuir was not in a good state of
health at the time she made the con
tract.
Holdaway refused to take back the
books because many of them had been
stamped with Mrs. Dunsmuir's mono
gram. They were rare works of lim
ited editions now out of print. He
brought suit for $15,169, but according
to the contract a part of this is not
yet due and the judgment given him
was only for the amount of $13,000,
with the costs of the action. The ac
ceptance of the books at Souther farm,
near San Leandro, the Dunsmuir home,
the Judge held made the delivery com
plete.

Chief J. M. Langley of Victoria, have
captured Lewis P. Ohlinger, president,
and J. R. Zimmerman, managing direc
tor of the Wooster National Bank of
Wooster, Maine County, Ohio, charged
with the embezzlement of the funds,
amounting to $260,000. The men have

waiving extradition.
Both prisoners came here from Seat

SHOPKEEPER TAKES AIM
Lies in Wait for Intruder
and Fires as Prowler Is
Getting Through Window
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 4.
Leading from the store of E. G. Gar
guila, 906 East Twenty-fifth street, De
tectives Holland and Shorey found a
trail of blood this morning, mute evi
dence, they take it, of the successful
aim Garguila took last night at a bur
glar, whom he heard prowling about
the place. The shopkeeper had been on
guard, because his place was entered
last Saturday night, when $23 and a
blanket were stolen. â¢
It was 2:30 o'clock this morning that
Garguila heard a front window slowly
raise. With pistol in hand he waited
until he could barely outline a man's
form at the opening. Then he fired
three times at the half-raised window.
Two bullets crashed through a pane of
glass and a third sank into the win
dow sill.
Garguila heard a rustling and sound
as of a man running. He did not pur
sue what he believes was the burglar.
At that time Garguila did not realize
he might have wounded the intruder.
The detectives traced the blood to the
street. They believe the burglar was
shot and got away on a bicycle.
HUBBY THINKS HIS
WIFE KISSED COUSIN
Husband Also Accuses Hep of Squan
dering Money for Bible and
Knickknacks.
OAKLAND, Jan. 4.âCharge and
counter-charge was made by John and
Mary Russell of West Berkeley to-day
in the trial of their divorce suit be
fore Judge Ellsworth. She accuses
him of cruelty and he charges her
with having squandered his money
and behaved in an indiscreet way with
other men. Russell said she had spent
$G for a Bible and $13 for things to
hang on the wall. He also said that
he had seen his wife kiss one Flory
McCarthy, a counsin of his, who
boarded at the Russell home.
Both Mrs. Russell and McCarthy de
nied the charge and , maintained that
nothing but the most proper relations
had existed between them. After con
sidering the matter Judge Ellsworth
intimated that the wife was entitled
to the divorce, but postponed his de
cision until the pair talked over the
disposition to be made of the three
children.
While it is some weeks since Ross
Van Horn was granted a divorce from
Marion Van Hortr and the custody ot
their son, Willis, he has been unable
to get the child from its mother and
this afternoon sued out a writ of
habeas corpus directing Mrs, Van
Horn to produce the boy before Judge
Greene to-morrow morning at 10
o'clock. The writ was served by the
Sheriff's deputy at her Vome in Berke
ley this evening.
Blanche Fulton was granted a di
vorce from Joseph Fulton, whom she
accused of having deserted her imme
diately after their wedding. She was
also allowed to resume her maiden
name of Blanche L. Phelps.
Annie B. Huber was granted a di
vorce from Charles O. Huber on the
ground of desertion. She was also
awarded $50 a month alimony and
given the custody of their 16-year-old
daughter, Lucille.
Suit for divorce on the ground of
cruelty has been begun by Margaret
P. Sinkwitz against William Sinkwitt.
Nellie Olson has begun a suit for di
vorce against Edward C. Olson on the

TO MAKE TEST CASE OF

Berkeley Trustees Suggest Means by
Which Dr. Woolsey May

Dr. F. H. Woolsey for vaccinating
school children in accordance with or
ders of the Board of Education is to
be made the subject of a suit to test
the right of the Trustees to engage
such services and to pay for them at
the rate charged by Dr. Woolsey. The
doctor's bill amounts to $426. Pay
ment of the claims was refused by the
Auditor, who declared he could find no
warrant for authorizing payment for
such services.
At a meeting of the board last night
It was suggested that Dr. Woolsey
bring suit and make a test case and
this probably will be done. In the

which the board desired to give chil
dren to whom it is under obligation
to provide street railway transporta
tion, in part, as follows:
"We have no tickets of any descrip
tion. Our own office force and direc
tors pay cash fares like any other pas
sengers and we cannot consistently Is
sue or receive tickets of any description
in payment of fare. If pupils cannot
be trusted with their car fare it would

Â«
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Jan. 4.
This was the carpenters' busy day in
Oakland. From one end of Broadway
and Washington street to the other the
merchants hastened to comply with
Maydr Olney's sign-removal order.
There were some who procrastinated.
These will be attended to by the street
department to-morrow, which will be
gin to remove all standing obstructions
and cart them off to the corporation
yard to De chopped up for kindling
wood in the City Prison.
Street Inspector W. W. Blair notified
merchants generally that 'o-day was
the last day of grace. His reception
was in the main satisfactory, showing
a desire among, the business men to get
behind the Mayor in tho move to im
prove the appearance of the principal
retail shop thoroughfares. In a few
cases merchants were rebellious and
defied the city authorities to remove
their signs. Such as were stubborn will
be visited to-morrow by city employes,
who will be equipped with tools for
immediate action.
City officials have tried to impress
merchants that the maintenance of
signs on the streets has been permitted
by sufferance, not by right; that no
one has power to grant as a privilege
the use of streets and sidewalks for
such purposes. It is upon this condi
tion that the summary removal of the
obstructions has been ordered by the
Mayor. He says his only purpose is to
tone up the city's externals.

KILLED BY SHOT
FULL IN FACE
Accidental Discharge of Gun
Ends Life of Mrs. Mul
queeney Near Livermore
TBIGGEB CAUGHT IN BED
Careless Shepherd Leaves the
Weapon Where It Is Easily
Fired When Picked Up
LIVERMORE. Jan. 4.âMrs. Mary
Mulquepney, the largest woman ranch
operator In Alameda County, was shot
in the face and killed by the acciden
tal discharge of a shotgun at her
home near Midway this morning.
Death was immediate, as a large part
of her face was torn away.
Mrs. Mary Mulqueeney owned and
operated a ranch of 9000 acres between
Llvermore and Midway. This property
is fine hill and grazing land and fell
to her twelve years ago when her hus
band died. She was a woman of force
and character and took hold of the
ranch and operated it herself with
great profit. A band of sheep was graz
ing but a short distance from the home
in charge of Mat Burrlll. and it was
the custom of the shepherd to patrol
the band during the night with a shot
gun to protect the young lambs from
the coyotes. If coyotes were heard he
fired his gun to frighten them, even if
he could not see the animals.
Toward morning Burrill went to the
bunkhouse on the ranch and took a
short sleep. InÃtead of putting the gun
in the corner he placed it beside his
bunk, and when he got up this morn
ing he left it there.
Mrs. Mulqueeney went to the bunk
house at about noon time to put it in
order. She started to pick up the gun,
drawing it toward her; the trigger
caught in something that lay near the
bunk, and the full charge took effect in
Bhe leaves three sons, Frank Mul
queeney, who owns the Club stables in
Oakland, and M. C. and W. C. Mul
queeney, who have been with her on
the ranch. The body was brought to
Llvermore to-night by Dr. Warner and
Deputy Coroner Conrad.

cause of the Timekeeper
â¦
MECHANISM IS SILENT
Men Were Well Paid and
Employers Da Not Know
What They Were Doing
The Introduction of an employes'
time clock at the Sanitary Reduction
Works at the foot of Klichth street was
the cause of eighty men quitting their
work yesterday. The men sternly re
fuse to ring up their time. They also
made demands which the employers
refuse to accede to. The places were
filled yesterday with new men and the
company says it will have no trouble
in having the work done.
A letter was sent to the board pf
directors of the sanitary company
Monday, giving two reasons why they
left work: "FirstâWe do not wish to
work under the time clock. Secondâ
We wish to be paid time and a half
for working Sundays and overtime at
night."
Andrea Sbarboro, in speaking of the
walkout, said: "This is the most un
reasonable strike ever declared in San
Francisco. We employ about eighty
men. Their work requires no skill
whatever. The lowest wages paid Is
$55 a month; most of them receive $80
and some of them get as high as $100
a month. They have been working
without any check on time, as they
pleased and when they pleased. The
board of directors ordered an em
ployes' time clock and It was sent over
to the works. The superintendent in
formed us that the men refused to
work under the time clock.
"In regard to paying their demand
for overtime, the board would have
considered it, as it was reasonable, al
though the men were making good
money, but the board absolutely re
fused to do away with the time clock.
"The Sanitary Reduction Works,
which is an absolute necessity to the
city, cost the stockholders $250,009. The
stockholders have not received one
cent in dividends, nor have the officers,
hence the board did not feel justified in
continuing to pay high wages for
work when it did not even know what
the men were doing."
MUSIC LOSES
NOTED FIGURE
IN AMERICA
CHICAGO, Jan. 4.â-Theodore Thomas,
the noted orchestra leader, died of
pneumonia at his residence here early
to-day. He was 70 years old.
Theodore Thomas was the son of an
expert violinist. He was born at
Eseus, Hanover, Germany. In 1845 his
parents brought him to the United
State, settling in New York City.
The real beginning of Thomas' mu
sical career was through a series of
chamber concerts in New York during
the years intervening between 1856 ana
1872. In 18Â«4 Thomas' first symphony
concerts were given in New York, and
these were continued until he left that
city in 1878 to take charge of the Col
lege of Music at Cincinnati.
He remained in Ohio for two years,
returning then to New York. He was
elected conductor of the New York
Philharmonic Society in 1879. and this
position he held until he left New York
in 1891-
In 1883 Thomas and his orchestra
made a tour from New York to San
Francisco, appearing at all of the
principal cities en route. Upon a return
to New York Thomas conceived the
idea of a permanent orchestra in that
city, but after seven years of endeavor
he came to the conclusion that Chioasro
would be a better place for his future
work. He came here In 1891 and formed
the Chicago Orchestra Association.
On December 15 last Orchestral Hall,
the permanent home of the Chicago
Orchestra, built at a cost of more than
$800,000, was formally dedicated.

BERKELEY. Jan. 4.âBy the burn
ing of their home at Allston way, near
the Santa Fe Railroad track, laat
night Charles Atwood and his wife and
six children were left destitute. The
entire family were in attendance at an
Oakland theater while their home
burned to the ground. When Atwood
returned and found a heap of smolder

and was restrained with difficulty front
doing violence to himself.
The house was built by him out of
his savings as a section foreman for
the Santa Fe Company and had been
occupied about a year. Neither build
ing nor furniture was insured. The
blaze is believed to have started from
a lamp left burning in the house.

HEADQUARTERS OF THIRD JAP
ANESE ARMY, AT PORT ARTHUR,
Jan 4.âThe formal entry of the Jap
anese into Port Arthur on January 8
will be an Imposing spectacle. The
Japanese officers will be given a ban
quet in the city on January 10.
The reason for the surrender of the
fortress is evident from a visit to
Wantai Hill. The entire strength of
the position lay In the main line of the
outer defenses. The possession of Wan
tai gave the besiegers the key to the
forts east of the city. The hills in the
rear were not fortified and afforded a
full cover for the assaulting forces.
TOKIO, Jan. 4.âThe following report
was received from General Nogi at 3
o'clock this afternoon.
"Order is maintained at Port Arthur
by the officers. The people are quiet.
Our minute investigation was not fin
ished until Tuesday night. The total
number of inhabitants is about 35.000,
of whom 25,000 are soldiers or sailors.
The total number of sick or wounded
is 20,000. Common provisions and
bread are plentiful, but there is a
scarcity of meat and vegetables. There
are no medical supplies at Port Arthur.
The Japanese are strenuously succor
ing the people. The capitulation com
mittees are pushing their respective
works."
The Jiji. in discussing the capture of
Port Arthur, reviews the price paid in
lives, and says:
"We ought to keep Port Arthur in
our hands so long as our empire ex
ists. Port Arthur is the key to peace in
the Par East and it is our duty to keep
the key in our hands."
The Emperor of Russia has cabled to
General Stoessel. saying that the giv
ing of their parole or the alternative
of imprisonment is optional with the
officers.
Street sales of the Russ have been
suspended by official order owing to
the tone of its editorial articles since
the fall of Port Arthur. The Narsh
radny has received "first warning."
OYAMA RENEWS ACTTVITY.
Fierce Night Attack Upon Kuropat
kin's Right Flank.
MUKDEN, Jan. 4.âOn Monday and
â¢ yesterday a general attack was ex
. pected. On Saturday the Japanese
showed indications of beginning seri
ous: operations. During the previous
n:ght they located a battery on the
Shakhe River bridge, from which they
- enfiladed the trenches, being
supported by a heavy cannoade along
the whole center. The Japanese used
khimose shells.
At midnight on Saturday, under
cover of impenetrable darkness, the
â¢Japanese attacked the right Russian
flank energetically, directing their
movement principally against a strong
redoubt, but they were repulsed.
Simultaneously an attack was launched
against the Russian trenches farther
east, but before daylight it was aban
doned.
British Steamship Condemned.
NAGASAKI, Jan. s.âThe British
steamship Nlgretia has been con
demned as a prize.
Japanese Party Annihilated.
TAYASTON, Manchuria, Sunday,
Jan. I.âLast night volun
teers, under command of Lieutenant
Georgivisky, destroyed a large native
house overlooking both the Russian
and the Japanese lines, from which
the Japanese signaled to the advanced
posts. It was a quiet piece of work.
The party surrounded the house with
out firing a shot. A hand to hand
fight with the Japanese ensued and all
of the Japanese were killed within
three minutes. The Japanese trenches
opened on the volunteers, but they re
tired safely.

WILL PRESERVE NEUTRALITY.
Dutch Naval Militia May Safeguard
Eastern Islands.
THE HAGUE, Jan. 4.âPremier
Kuyper has abandoned his projected
stay in the south of France for the
benefit of his health, as he considers
the question of maintenance of strict
Dutch neutrality in the East Indies
demands his personal attention. In
the event of it becoming necessary the
Marine Ministry is prepared to call
out the naval militia for the purpose
of safeguarding the neutrality of the
Dutch Eastern islands.
It is understood that the Japanese
cruisers reported in those seas are of
small fighting value and that they
were merely sent to watch possible
movements of the Russian second Pa
cific squadron there.

Brown Prisoners in
Port Arthur Are
Released.
LONDON, Jan. s.âThe Daily Mall's
j correspondent with General Nogi's
army before Port Arthur, in a dispatch
published this morning, says that the
Russian torpedo-boat destroyers were
purposely permitted to escape from
Port Arthur, under the eyes of the
j Japanese fleet, as a tribute to the brav
ery of the Russian garrison.
The correspondent adds that 200 Jap
anese prisoners were discovered at Port
Arthur, many of them having partici
pated in the desperate efforts to block
the channel and who hitherto were sup
posed to be dead.
The Daily Telegraph's Port Arthur
correspondent telegraphs a picturesque
account of the scene at the time of the
negotiations for the capitulation of Port
Arthur. He says:
It was a magnificently sunny day, with a
wonderful stillness reigning over the belliger
ent lines. A strange concourse was gathered
in the vicinity of the cottage where two white
Hags showed that the parlementalres were de
liberating and comprised wondering Chinese
peasants, children and smiling Japanese "Tom
mies," alt srroupÂ«d around nine dismounted
Cossack escorts who carried' on a gesticulatory
"conversation" with the Japanese escort.
I Thrive the parlementalres sepaiated and went
to their respective tents before the first docu
ment was comrletid anO. at 4 o'clock, dis
patched to Gen-ral Stoessel at Port Arthur.
An hour later the second document wss com
pleted and handed to another Cossack, who,
accompanied by Japanese cavalrymen. dasi**Â»i
toward Port Arthur. l>ater, when dusk set in.
General Stcessel signed the documents and the
telephone informed the investing troops of the
j glad tidings. Immediately "banzals" were
i shouted and Bensal lights and flares flashed
from ridge to ridge until midnight, when all
again became strangely quiet.
STOESSEL'S PATHETIC PLEA.
Asks the Czar to Re Merciful to His
Heroic Garrison.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 4.âGeneral
Stoessel's last dispatch, dated January
1. prior to the surrender of Port Ar
thur, details the Japanese attack of De
cember 31 and concludes as follows:
We shall be obliged to capitulate, but
everything is in the hands of God. We have
suffered tearful losses.
Great Sovereign, pardon us! We have done
everything humanly possible. Judge us, but be
merciful. Nearly eleven months of uninter
rupted struggle have exhausted us. Only one
quarter of the garrison is alive, and of this
number the majority are sick, and, being
obliged to act on the defensive without even
short intervals of repose, are v.-orn to shadows.
Reports from Chefu state that Gen
eral Stoessel Is broken-hearted and be
lieves himself disgraced in the eyes of
the world. Civilians who have arrived
at Chefu from Port Arthur say the old
warrior has not the slightest concep
tion of the real view of his stubborn
defense held throughout Christendom.
He realizes simply that he was com
pelled to capitulate and that the de
fense of Port Arthur was a failure.
Were it not for his wound, which kept
him confined to his bed, it is probable
the general would have sought death
on the firing line to be spared the re
sponsibility for giving the order of
capitulation.
A further batch of dispatches from
General Stoessel, given out to-day, do
not add much to what is already
known. He reports the killing of Gen
eral Kondratenko and eight other offi
cers and the wounding of seven officers
on December 15 by an 11-inch shell,
which exploded In the casemate of fort
No. 3. He says he lost 200 men on De
cember 12 and December 19.
A dispatch of December 11 from Gen
eral Stoessel settles the question as to
who sank the Russian warships, saying
that all those in the inner harbor were
sunk by 11-lnch Japanese shells, with
the exception of the Sevastopol, which
was towed to the outer harbor and for
four nights repulsed Japanese torpedo
boats. Stoessel says:
To-day Â«ix to ten battalions of reinforce
ments reached the Japanese. All the retrench
ments in front of the fortress are firmly held,
in expectation of an attack. The Japanese are
bombarding: the hospitals with 11-lnch shells.
Hospital No. 6 has been demolished and hos
pitals Noa. 9 and 10 'are damaged. Two sur
geons and a Sister of Mercy have been wound
ed, while several of our wounded men were
again hit.
Dr. Balascheff is working untiringly, but it
Is difficult to attend 10.000 wounded, especi
ally In face of frequent bombardments and the
frost. We have very few officers; 200 fell in
October and November. I am replacing them
with non-commissioned officers, who are doing
heroic service. I could not get on without
them.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 5. 1905.
Baltic Fleet Not to
Proceed to the
Far East
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 5 (5:30 a.
i m.) âThe scenes at the Admiralty
and War Office yesterday were a repe
; tition of those of Tuesday, crowds of
j weeping women and children vainly
i asking for lists of the survivors of the
I Port Arthur garrison, which could not
be given.
J While the Russian military law is im
perative in the requirement that the
I commander of a fortress who surren
â¢ ders shall be tried by court-martial, the
. Emperor undoubtedly will order that'
! this formality be dispensed with in the I
j case of General Stoessel.
It seems now to be definitely under
stood that Vice-Admiral Rojestvensky's
squadron will not attempt at present j
to reach Vladivostok. The decision has '
j been reached that he will await the j
third Pacific squadron, on which work j
is proceeding night and day and several ;
ships of which are expected to be ready j
for service by the end of January. It j
is by no means certain that Rojestven- !
i sky will return with his ships to Euro- I
pean waters. He may await the third !
! squadron off the coast of Madagascar
and seize and make his base one of the
uninhabited coral islands of Polynesia.
In view of the report that the Japan
ese intend to invest Vladivostok, Gen
eral Batiavoff, who has been inter
viewed, has expressed the opinion that
If Vladivostok should be blockaded
i Rojestvensky would be compelled to re
t turn.
Many interesting incidents in connec
tion with Port Arthur, hitherto care
fully concealed, are now commented
upon. When the protected cruiser
Boyarln was lost by going on the rocks
her captain, Sarytchoff, was subjected â¢
to considerable criticism. He appealed â 
personally to Emperor Nicholas for I
mercy, saying that if forgiven he,
would offer his life for his country.
Thereafter Captain Sarytchoff volun
teered on every occasion for dangerous
duty. He commanded the gunboat I
Gileak at Kinchow, and later a shore j
battery at Tiger's Tall, Afterward the '
captain engaged in several sorties, but
seemed to bear a charmed life and re
ceived not so much as a scratch.
Emperor Nicholas is expected to re
turn to-morrow to St. Petersburg,
when a council of war will be held.
PIRATES MENACE KAMCHATKA.
Americans in League With Japanese
Seal Poachers.
KABARAVSK, Russia, Jan. 4.â
Silnitzky, the Russian official who or
ganized the defense of Kamchatka,
and owing to an inexplicable blunder
was arrested by order of the late Min
ister of the Interior yon Plehwe, has
just arrived here after a six months'
Journey through Yakutsk. He says
Japanese and American pirates laid
covetous eyes on Kamchatka at the
very beginning of the war, but that the
population, though a mere handfull,
beat off all attacks, burned many Jap
anese schooners, annihilated a landing
party and captured the Mikado's emis
sary.
A Russian named Baron Bruggers,
who is a director of the sealing indus
try, arrived at Kamchatka aboard an
American steamship and spread pessi
mistic tales of Russian reverses. The
inhabitants, greatly Incensed, refused
to believe his reports and resolved to
defend their territory if hostile war
ships appeared and if It became neces
sary emulate Duokhivsky's example
and burn the city of Petropavlovsk,
retire to an island and wage a guerilla
warfare.
Grebnitzky, the official In charge of
the Commander Islands, arrived about
that time and insisted that the volun
teer companies be disbanded, and ow
ing to an explicable blunder Silnitzky
and his assistants were compelled to
hand over the management of Kam
chatka to Grebnitzky.
Silnitzky says the work of the Amer
ican steamship Mineola was extremely
suspicious. He hints that light is be
ginning to be thrown upon a con
spiracy against Russian Bealing inter
ests in Kamchatka.

RUSSIA MAKES PROTEST.
Denounces the Shelling of Port
Arthur's Hospitals.
PARIS, Jan. 4.âThe Russian Em
bassy has transmitted to Foreign Min
ister Delcasse a protest against Japan's
alleged violation of The Hague stipu
lations relative to the immunity of
hospitals from attack. The protest is

struck during the Japanese bombard
ment, wounding some of the inmates.
Delcasse will forward the protest to
Japan.
LITTLE BOOTY FOR VICTORS.
Coal and Rice Are All That Remain in
Port Arthur.
CHEFU, Jan. 4. âIt is said that the
booty which fell into the hands of the
Japanese at Port Arthur amounted
only to 80,000 tons of coal and two
months' rations of rice.

Mountain Lion Chases a Miner.
REDDING, Jan. 4.âA cougar or

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 4.âOwners of

tbat he advocated the suppression of
the paper in his message to the Legis

ROBERTS IS ANXIOUS.
Robert W. Roberts, president of the
Board of Election Commissioners, in
an interview last night stated:
The time has come when either the Inno
cence or guilt of the Election Commissioners
must bo definitely settled. Ws have been as
sailed by a designing press that has stopped
at nothing to heap discredit upon the efforts
of the commission to give the community a
pure ballot and clean administration of its
election affairs. A cowed and partisan Grand
Jury has (prostituted its power to inaugurate
a legal proceeding that has failed and no stone
has b?*n left unturned to Injure the present
city administration by besmirching the Elec
tion Commissioners and piling false charges
up against them.
We have waited patiently and In rain for
some sort of a public trial that would settle
the matter one wag or the other. This has
been denied us to date, for the Grand Jury
would not hear our side of the story and the
press is devoted to but one phase of the situ
ation. We have, therefore, demanded a public
Investigation and are prepared to stand by the
results. We have nothing to conceal or to be
ashamed of. I
Following is a copy of the request
for trial as made by the members of
the commission:
To the Honorable Eugene E, Schmlts, Mayor
of the City and County of San FranciscoâWe.
the undersigned, members of the Board of
Election Commissioners of the City and County
of San Francisco, hereby represent to your
Honor that certain charges have been made
against us and each of us, accusing us of
willful and corrupt misconduct In our*said
office, as said Election Commissioners, and we
and each of us hereby represent that you, as
said Mayor of tbe city and county, by virtue
of the powers imposed upon you by the charter
of said city and county to investigate the
conduct of all officials of said city and county,
do fully investigate any and all charges of will
ful and corrupt misconduct against the mem
bers of said Board of Election Commissioners.

PLAN TO FIGHT
TOBACCO TRUST
Independent Manufacturers
and Dealers Organize to
Wage the Trade Campaign
The tobacco trust finds guns of war
leveled at it in San Francisco. There
is no capitulation to it in its move to
take the city for wholesale and retail
trade in tobacco. The independent
manufacturers, wholesalers and store
keepers are preparing to resist to the
starvation point, they say, the cam
paign to make them yield.
They met last night, about 250 In
number, all enthusiastic for the fray.
They revived the Cigar and Tobacco
Merchants' Association, effected a new
organization and made plans to fight
the trust.
J. S. Parry announced that he had
taken st ;>s to deal the "vulture" a
smashing blow. He will have a bill in
troduced in the Legislature prohibiting
the giving away of coupons or certltb
cates with tobaccos, cigars and cigar
ettes.
The independents are to retard the
sale of the American Tobacco Com
pany's goods by appeal to their cus
tomers. The millions of the trust are a
drop in the bucket, say the independ
ents, if the independents will now
stand together.
The following were the officers elect
ed to lead in the great war of smoke:
President, J. S. Parry; first vice rre.Â«ident,
E5. W. Brigge; second vice president, William
Harrison; third vice president. M. Coblentz;
secretary, I.eon S. Mayer; treasurer. Slg. Ca
hen; directors (retailers) âHenry Harris. H.
Wolf, Dan P. Carter, Ben Adler. Max Cahen;
cigar manufacturersâD. Frenckel and S.
Hoffman; tobacco manufacturersâJ. R.
Blanchard and T. J. Linehan; leaf tobacco
dealer, Albert Kohlberg; cigarette manufac
turer. H. Bonis; city salesmenâEd Allenberg
and K. Bailie; wholesalersâMilton S. Esberg
and H. Bier.
In his speech accepting the presi
dency Parry declared that he would
serve only on the assurance that he
had the unswerving support of "the
cigar dealers who own their own stores
and their own souls." He said:
We are going to have a long, hard and seri
ous fight and must have determined support.
With tha strong backing of our association, I
am willing to take oft my coat, go to the bat
and give the best that's In me for the fight.
Never mind about a speech from meâit is
action that we want.
Remarks were made by several Oak
land dealers, who are threatened by
the American Tobacco Company, and
a desire to co-operate with the San
Francisco organization in hearty fash
ion was expressed- All those called on
were hopeful that the trust could be
successfully combated.
Donations from leading Independent
firms to the cause were reported to the
amount of $550.
E. W. Brlggs urged the independent
dealers to stand together. He had
words of condemnation for those who
had "sold out to the trust." He spoke
in praise of M. A. Gunst & Co. and of
C. V. Poar for "standing between tho
If every American article were as Rood as Sorosis shoes.
Uncle Sam would supply the whole world with its merchandise.
It is well known that the American manufacturer sells his
product abroad at a lower price than he charges at home.
Cheap cost of production in Europe forces him to cut the
price.
But Sorosis shoes sell at a premium in Europe. Their
merit commands it.
Neither low-priced nor high-priced shoes can compete with
the lasting beauty and comfort of Sorosis. It stands alone as
the acme of good shoemaking.
In England Sorosis shoes cost $4.00 a pair; in Germany
and Canada $4.50; in France and Russia $5.00.

LOOKS FORWARD
TO A BIG YEAR
Banker Hutton of New York
Is Firm in Belief That
1905 Will Be Prosperous
â¢ No one takes a more hopeful view of
the commercial conditions of this coun
try for the coming year than Edward
F. Hutton, a well-known New York
banker, who is among the latest ar
rivals at the St. Francis. Banker Hut
ton is making a short visit to San
Francisco on private business. In dis
cussing the commercial affairs of-the
country last evening he said:
During the last thirty days activity on the
New. York Stock Exchange has been pro
nounced and the transactions have been the
greatest since the bull market of 1901. It
was but a natural result, after a continued
advance in the price of securities for six
months with very lew reactions, ana those or
small moment, that a time would arrive when
adverse news would bring aboqt a material re
action. In fact, speculation had begun to as
sume such proportions at the opening of De
cember that many of the leading financial In
stitutions in New York were hoisting danger
signals. Banks were scrutinizing collateral
more carefully and there was a general feel
ing that a reaction must come before the flm
of the new year. It came, however, most un
expectedly, as Is usually the case, shortly
after the Issuance of the President's message,
and on Wednesday and Thursday, December (1
and 7. liquidation was severe and at times
panicky. The same large interests that
brought about the reaction appeared as buyers
of stocks on Thursday, and they have been ac
cumulating them on all weak days since then.
The technical position of the market is now
a strong one and I look for a resumption cf
the uoward trend of securities without any
great reaction for some time. It has been
frequently observed that "as .gees iron and
steel, so goes the country." The production
and consumption of pig Iron is rapidly in
creasing. The large steel companies are re
fusing orders for delivery beyond June next
and prices are being raised on all finished
products. It Is the general opinion that the
exports of merchandise from the United States
for 1904 will exceed 5000.000.000. which breaks
the high record of 1901 over $60,000,000.
In considering railroad earnings It Is well to
keep in mind that during the last six months
the railroad companies of this country bay*
expended hundreds of millions of dollars for
betterments. The effect of these expenditures
will ultimately become apparent In the reduced
operating expenses, and it is also reasonable to
expect that before long these extraordinary ex
penditures will cease. Then the true earning
power cf the big railroads will be shown and
result in the payments of dividends where
none are now being paid and increased divi
dends on many roads now on the market list.
With enormous corn and cotton crops and
high prices for wheat, an increased production
of gold and enlarged exports of our manufac
tured roods I look forward to the year 190R
with a strong belief In an improvement in all
lines of business, and. as a natural result, a
general advance in prices of securities ana
better conditions for the people in - all sec
tions of ths country-
trust and the Independent dealers. Let
us not be frightened like sheep, but
let us give battle and this wolf of a
trust will turn out to be an ass in
wolf's skin."
Other speakers were Herman Gud
stadt, M., Cerf. Charles Mattheas and
President Parry.

Travers took her out in the lead and
as the track was still somewhat heavy
the riders invariably picked a course
fully fifteen feet from the rail. Under
those adverse conditions she lost by
less than a length in 1:44%, within half
a second of the coast record.
SCHOOLMATE WELL HANDLED.
The winner. Schoolmate, perfectly
ridden by \Y. Davis, was never worse
thai) third and had the first choice at
his mercy when the stretch was
reached. Ara ran an indifferent third.
Magrane showed a twinkle of early
speed. Leila and Stilicho made no
showing whatever. As good as 10 to 1
could be had about the winner.
Favorite players again spent an un
easy session, for the ' baby" racer Sir
Wilfred, a 7 to 10 chance alone won
brackets. Handy Bill, Budd Wade,
Redan and Ishtar, In addition to
Schoolmate, dropped in at lengthy quo
tations.
Handy Bill made a show of Dei
farina, the 13 to 20 favorite for the
opening seven furlong selling number.
There was a genteel play on Bill at
4 and 5 to 1. and with Willie Daly up
he led from start to finish. The favor
ite disposed of Baker by three lengths
for the place. The other starters were
outclassed-
At his second essay D. Cameron's Sir
Wilfred made good. The son of Ossary
and Plumeria went to the post a 7 to
10 choice and spreadeagled his field.
Soledad, the Napa Stock Farm entry,
piloted by Bullman, held the balance
of the field safe, leading out Abe Meyer
half a length for place honors. Dora
Gentry beat the barrier, leading for
about a sixteenth of a mile.
BUDD WADE WINS BY A NOSE.
Both of the choices, Lady Kent and
The Lieutenant, finished behind Budd
Wade in the mile selling affair. The
stable connections were sweet on Budd
yesterday and turned loose their money
with lavish hand in the ring. He had
O. Chandler In the saddle, and, after
looking an easy winner a furlong from
home, only downed Lady Kent, the
pacemaker, the shortest kind of a head.
Ihe Lieutenant finished a distant
third. Molto, a backed outsider, dis
played some early speed, but can't beat
this kind.
Bullman handed the Futurity course
sprint, fifth to be decided, with Redan,
an 8 to 1 outsider in the betting. He
got the sprinter away sailing and,
never in difficulties, breezed in ahead
of Joe Frey and Royal W T hlte, two
other neglected ones. Peter J, the fa
vorite, couldn't run fast enough to
raise a scrape. Berendos did not get
away from the barrier.
Rector, favorite, and Padua, second
choice, finished last and next to that
obhorred position, respectively, in the
abhorred position, respectively, in the
Bride, astride Ishtar, a 15 to 1 shot, led
almost from the start, winning cleverly
by a length from Judge and Little
Wally. Travers, on Rector, got away
poorly and could not break through
the blockade. Jones made a fine mess
Of it with Padua. 4

MOTIVE POWER
TO BE CHANGED
Works Board Grants Permit
for Conversion of the Cali
fornia Street Beach Line
I he Board of Works yesterday grant
ed a permit to the United Railroads to
change the present steam railroad from
California street and Ceneral avenue
to the Cliff House into an overhead
electric system over the same route.
Mrs. Emma L. Merritt, executrix of
the Sutro estate, withdrew her previous
protest against the granting of the
permit. Mrs. Merritt objected to a
double track on the Sutro property,
but City Engineer Woodward reported
that so far as the franchise for that
portion of the road is concerned it ap
pears to be optional with the owners
whether it is to have a single or double
track. The franchise for the road be
tween Parker and First avenues ex
pires in 1929 and the right to use elec
tricity thereon will be secured from the
Supervisors. The franchise between
First avenue and the beach will ex
pire in 1911. It Is understood that work
on the reconstruction of the road will
begin at once, all the material being
on hand.
The Supervisors' Street Committee
later recommended a resolution grant
ing the United Railroads permission to
use electricity on that portion of the
road on California street between Par
ker and First avenues- The committee
also favored the use of Iron poles on
the system.
The board ordered grades to be
changed on Fulton street from Twenty
fifth avenue to Thirty-seventh avenue.
Provision in the budget was made for
the expenditure of $15,000 for the im
provement of Fulton street from Twen
ty-fifth avenue to the Great Highway.
The appropriation is not sufficient to
carry out the entire improvement and
the matter of making grade changes
will be taken up separately.
The petitions of Albert Meyer to mac
adamize I street, between Twentieth
and Twenty-first avenues, and of A. B.
Clute to bituminize Sixth avenue, be
tween Clement and California streets,
were denied.
The board appointed John Casey
foreman in Chinatown, vice John But
ler transferred.
The petition of residents that the
premises at 2964 Twenty-second street
be condemned as a menace to life was
referred to the Health Board.
The City Architect's plans for a two
story frame engine-house on Twenty
sixth avenue, near Point Lobos avenue,
| were referred to the Fire Department.
i After the meeting P. M. Gopcevic, a
member of the F. M. Yorke Company,
which has the contract for repairing
bituminous pavements, held a consul
tation with President Schmitz. The
latter urged Gopcevic to resume the
work of repairing the streets as the
Supervisors' Finance Committee had
requested him to do. Gopcevic de
murred, saying that his bills had not
been paid for August and September on
the pretext that the measurements of
the area covered had not been correctly
made.
Gopcevic, after consulting with F. M.
Yorke, flatly refused to go on with the
work- He claims that the Finance
Committee has acted in bad faith by
holding up the bills for work already
done; also that the company's contract
for paving H street was abrogated be
cause the Supervisors had not recom
mended the Improvement, although the
contract for improving Nineteenth ave
nue, which was also not recommended,
had been settled.
The Board of Works will report the
matter to the Supervisors' Finance
Committee and it is likeiy that steps
will be taken to forfeit the contract
and do the work either by inviting new
bids or by day labor by the city itself.
TURCHETTI CHARGED WITH MURDER.
In the Inquest on the body of William Mc-
Allister yesterday a Coroner's Jury returned
a verdict charging Alvlso Turchetti with mur
der. Turchetti shot and killed McAllister on
Pacific street on Christmas night.
AMATEUR CLUBS
ARE UNDER FIRE
The Athletic Officials Are
Finally Moving Against
Small Fight Promoters
3JORE WEIGHT FOR GANS
Baltimore Vaudeville Artist
and Gardner Will Not
Meet at Lightweight Limit
If the Supervisors are sincere in
their stand that they will suppress the
so-called amateur boxing clubs if evi
dence is forthcoming to show they are
sailing under false colors there may
ba no more such exhibitions.
At the annual meeting of the Pacific
Athletic Association the governing
body of amateur sport on this coast,
President William Greer Harrison of
the Olympic Club made a strong ad
dress dealing chiefly with this evil.
He said he, individually, would render
all the assistance in his power to
stamp It out and would guarantee the
aid of the Olympic Club.
The matter was brought forcibly
home to the Olympic Club last Friday
night when Sam Berger, one of its
members, took part in one of these af
fairs. The directors have sufficient
evidence before them to warrant drop
ping Berger from the membership
roll. When he was elected a regular
member it was with the understanding
that he would hand the secretary his
written resignation. This was to be
used at the option of the directors.
Jimmy Britt presented the same
form of resignation when he was
elected. In his case he is an avowed
professional, while Berger is charged
with sailing under false colors. The
directors will act on Berger's case to
morrow night.
The fight promoting clubs have been
making big money out of the young
boys who make up the major portion
of their cards. The receipts at three
of these affairs recently were respec
tively $2900, $3200 and $3600. The
boys are paid a mere pittance, while
the managers pocket big profits.
Although It was given out on Tues
day that Gans and Jimmy Gardner
were to meet here at 133 pounds at
6 o'clock, these figures were amended
yesterday to read 136 at 6 o'clock.
It is known Gans would have difficulty
In touching the lightweight limit.
Gardner is said to be no better off, as
h.. la a big, rangy young fellow, who
is growing rapidly.
After Gans' poor showing with Britt
the promoters are taking a chance on
tho attitude the public will assume
when he .appears again. There will
surely be little betting until Herford
declares with which man he wants to
win. Possibly they should be coupled
in the betting. His friends openly
boasted after the Britt fight that it
was originally Intended that Jimmy
should win, but the Baltimore manipu
lator thought there would be more
money in the betting to have Gans win
and Gans did win.
After the "fight" Gans told one man
he could have beaten Britt in one
round, while to another he confided he
could have beaten him with one hand
tied behind him. Even a nearsighted
man can see Gardner's finish if the
Baltimore flreater Is sent in to fight
and not to tfake. The public which
patronizes these exhibitions will have
to take its chances as to what it will
see.
LEARN SCHOOLS' NEEDS
FOR SANITARY REPAIRS
Supervisor d'Ancona and Director

ings to Take Notes.
School Director Roncovieri and Su
pervisor d'Ancona yesterday visited

TRACKS OFFER
CORRIGAN AID
Officials Join the Racing
Magnate iv His Fight
With Western Jockey Club
NEWPORT TURNED DOWN
Famous Outlaw Course Will
Not Be Included in the
New Circuit Now Forming
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 4.âEdward Corrigan
and his forces met in Mr. Corrigan's
room at the Annex to-day and dis
cussed their plans of warfare in the
coming battle with the Western Jockey
Club. During the day they were vis
ited by a representative of the famous
Newport, Ky., track, and were in re
ceipt of a telegram from P. J. Car
mody of St. Louis, stating the St. Louis
courts had set aside the recent sale of
Union track and offering his support in
case he and his associates regained con
trol of the course.
The significance attached to this de
sire on the part of outside racing asso
ciations to assist Corrigan, Devereaux,
Winn, Respess and others in the fight
tends to show that sympathy may plsy
a part in the coming clash of the West
ern Jockey Club tracks and the new
circuit that will undeniably be formed
to oppose them.
During the conference, which lasted
all day and well into the evening, Mr.
Nolan of Cincinnati made his appear
ance in the interest of the famous out
law Newport track, last conducted by
John J. Ryan of "get-rich-qulck" no
toriety.
Mr. Nolan addressed Mr. Corrigan in
person and immediately began to in
quire as to the prospects of the New
port track being taken into the new cir
sult among others. Corrigan told No
lan he wanted nothing to do with New
port at any stage of the game, and
those present voiced his sentiments.
Nolan persisted, but his attempt for
recognition was futile and he went
away discouraged.
Corrigan and the men who are fight
ing for the rights with him refrained
from divulging their immediate plans.
"PITTSBURG PHIL" IS ILL.
Famous Plunger in Serious Condition
in a North Carolina Sanitarium.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.âGeorge E.
Smith, "Pittsburg Phil," it was report
ed along Broadway this afternoon, is
seriously ill in Asheville, N. C, where
he has been for sSncie time in a sani
tarium. Mr. Smith has been in ill
health for several years. Last sea
son he was reported dying in the Adi
rondacks. He was somewhat con
spicuous around Eastern race courses
for a portion of the season, although
his operations in the ring were by no
means so extensive as formerly.
During the holidays he sent many
Christmas presents to old friends In
Pittsburg, where he first began his
remarkably successful career as a
backer of race horses. It is said
"Phil" still continues to take an inter

Schooner Ida flcKay Dismasted as She Reaches Port
The schooner O. M. Kellogg, which
arrived yesterday morning from Rara
tonga* was run into Tuesday niglit
while lying at anchor off the heads
by the schooner Ida McKay, bound in
from Eureka. The Kellogg escaped
'Without injury, but the Ida McKay
â¢looked very much the worse for wear
when she came into port. Her rigging
â¢oft the starboard side was carried away,
her- mizzen mast was lying on deck in a
tangle of wire rope and the shifting
rÂ»f her deckload gave her a heavy list.
Bhe strained her timbers against the
Btout sides of the Kellogg and had
t,wo feet of water In her hold when
she anchored. Nobody was injured on
either vessel.
The O. M. Kellogg. Captain Iversen,
is from Raratonga. a small Island of
the Cook group. The harbor at Rara
tonga was just wide enough to admit
the Kellogg, with about two feet to
spare on either side. The Island itself
â¢is only six miles long by four miles
wide, but is exceedingly fruitful. Cap
tain Iversen says the place is the near
esl to Paradise he ever expects to find
on this earth. The fifty whites and
400 natives that make up Raratonga's
population are all most hospitably in
clined and when Captain Iversen was
r.nt being entertained ashore as many
of the inhabitants as could crowd on
beard were dancing on the Kellogg's
deck.
"It is Paradise unspoiled," said Cap
tain Iversen yesterday, "and long may
it be kept from the kind of civiliza
tion that has spoiled many of the
South Sea islands. The people are
kind and intelligent, healthy, easy-go
ing and prosperous. They have a reli
gious service once every two months
and the merchant is a "bigger citizen
than the missionary. I'm a pretty
ancient mariner, but of all the places I
*>ver visited Rrtrntonga holds first
rlace. If I'd discovered it earlier I'd
have been one of its leading citizens
now."
Raratonga ships about 150 tons a
month of tropical products, mostly to
Australia. The Kellogg brought 392
ttins of copra and 46.000 cocoanuts.
Raratonga is about "00 miles from
Tahiti and the have much in
common. Tahiti having the advantage
o? regular communication with the
outside world.
Tug Sea Rover Returns.
The tug Sea Rover, which went north to
assist the disabled steamer Lakme to port, re
turned yesterday, having failed to find the
broken down coaster. The Lakme, in tow of
tne North Fork, was driven by the eoutherly
.'itorm far to the north of Humboldt. This.
.r""cbably I? the reason the Rover's mission
waÂ« a failure. WhÂ»n last seen the North

Stockholders of a Brewing
Company Have a Quarrel
Over Division of Profit
OLD REVOLVER DRAWN
August Meyer Swears Out a
Warrant for the Arrest
of Partner and Employer
If the saloon men who purchase
i foamy steam and lager from the Col
j umbia Brewing Company discover
blood stains all over their beer kegs
I they need not be astonished, for there
are activities not induced by hops in
| the joy factory at 326 Clementina street.
> Tuesday evening the hard feelings of
. the two owners of the establishment
i found vent in a vociferous quarrel, and
' before the dispute was ended President
and General Manager H. D. Ulrichs
flourished a revolver in the face of
: August Meyer, a stockholder and
! driver.
| Yesterday Meyer swore out a war
'â  rant for Ulricas' arrest, charging that
j the books of the concern were kept
! from him and that he had been
| assa ted. - ach says the other is try
' ing to get control of the entire estab
; lishment and both punctuate their as
! sertions with remarkably forceful
; German-Engiish epithets,
i The Ulrichs family controls one-half
jof the capital stock. The Meyer family
controls the other half. The president
of the concern, however, controls all
the directors. When a stockholders'
meeting is called, Meyer is present with
half but less than a majority of the
stock. Ulrichs fails to vote and the
directors remain unchanged. This
might suit Meyer were it not for the
fact that the directors handle the
money.
Ulrichs says, "* gave him half of the
profits."
Meyer says. "He takes half the
profits, I get half and his son gets
another half."
This form of division is under the
scrutiny of the courts as a result of
ihe filing of five different civil suits.
Meyer says he simply wanted to get a
view of the books Tuesday evening.
Ulrichs says his fellow-etockholder
wished to destroy the corporation's rec
ords. At any rate, Ulrichs drew a
weapon that must have been used by
the Chinese when they first invented
gunpowder 500 years before the Chris
tian era and Meyer dropped the books.
After further fracturing the already
battered atmosphere. Meyer went home.
Ulrichs was released on $40 cash bail.
A young Ulrichs is secretary and
wagon driver for the concern. The case
will be discussed in the Police Court to
morrow.
INQUIRES INTO
EPPINGER CASE
The Grand Jury yesterday turned its
attention to the alleged swindle that
Eppinger & Company perpetrated on
the banks by means of forged ware
house certificates. A number of wit
nesses were examined, but no definite
conclusion was reached in the effort to
bring about more effective prosecution.
Jacob Eppinger, one member of the
grain firm, was tried some months ago,
but the jury disagreed. His brother
Herman has also been charged, and
the trial is set for the near future.
Colonel J. C. Beck, who was for
merly manager \of the International
Banking Company, the principal suf
ferer from the looting of the ware
houses, was called to testify yester
day. President Bowles of the .Ameri
can Natio:.al Bank was also a witness.
The others called were C. F. Herlitz
and Robert Williams. The latter came
from Crockett. Contra Costa County,
where Eppinger & Company had a
big warehouse. He was a grain in
spector at the time the frauds were
committed.
The Jurors also investigated the case
of B. C. Parks, who was tried in Judge
Lawlor's court on a charge of em
bezzlement, escaping conviction by a
disagreement of the jury. It is alleged
that while serving as manager of a
men s furnishing store on Sixth street,
owned by Mrs. Mary Selowsky, he mis
appropriated funds to the amount of
$9000. Parks disappeared from the city
after his trial, but he has returned and
It is desired ro have him indicted. No
indictment was returned yesterday, but
it probably will be to-morrow night, to
which time the Grand Jury adjourned.
The Police Committee, which has
been investigating corruption in China
town, reported progress. Not much has
been accomplished for several days.

building by the Humboldt Savings
Bank at 18 Geary street may be tem
porarily delayed by legal proceedings.
It was proposed to begin work imme
diately, but one of the tenants of the
structure now on the premises refuses
to move and a suit for eviction will be
commenced by the bank to-day.
The building now on the premises is
a three-story structure and the base
ment is occupied by a saloon known as
"Faust Hall.'* This saloon was leased
one year ago from the bank by the
San Francisco Breweries (Ltd.) and it
is over the terms of the lease that the
dispute has arisen. The lease calls for
three years and the brewery people re
fuse to move until that time has ex
pired. The banking people admit that
the lease was written for three years,
but they also aver that a specification
was made that the tenants could be
evicted at the end of one year should
they desire to improve the property.
Soon after the lease was made the
bank made preparation for the erection
of a twelve-story office building and
notified the tenants that they would
have to move by the first of the year.
This request met with no objection
except from the brewing company and
the building, with the exception of the
basement, was unoccupied and ready
for destruction before December L
The bank, which had been doing busi
ness on the first floor for the past thir
ty-five years, moved to 626 Market
street and the other tenants scattered
elsewhere. But the holders of the
lease for "Faust Hall" remain obdu
rate and the legal contest will begin
with the suit to evict them, which will
be brought this morning.
Attorney William Barnes for Bauer
RUBBER STOCK
SALE OPPOSED
Application of West Coasi
Company's Assignee Is De
feated by Chief Creditor
FREDRICKS IS OBJECTOR
Former President Says That
He Has No Confidence in
the Man Now in Control
The application of Don A. Sutherland,
assignee of the West Coast Rubber
Company, for permission to sell the
$40,000 stock of the concern in parcels
at private sale did not meet with Judge
Troutt'B approbation yesterday and,
though stating that he would not make
a final decision until the opposing sides
had been given a chance to reach an
agreement, the court said that the ap
plication was altogether too broad.
Attorney T. C. Van Ness, represent
ing George Fredrlcks. former presi
dent of the company and its heaviest
creditor, opposed the application and
demanded that no sale should be made
until Fredrlcks had been notified and
given a chance to object. He said that
Fredricks had no confidence in the as
signee nor in the persons who procured
his appointment, chiefly Bennett, Good
all & Co. He even declared that Suth
erland was incompetent to handle the
stock satisfactorily, and intimated that
through the medium of a third party a
sale of the goods might be effected at a
price below its real value, to the-detri
ment of Fredricks, who, besides having
the largest claim, was also in the posi
tion of a deficiency debtor.
Attorney Kellogg, representing the
assignee, took exceptions to Mr. Van
Ness' statements and declared that the
assignee was under heavy bonds and
was entitled to some confidence. He
declared further that Fredricks was not
entitled to as much consideration as
the other creditors because he had
started a suit against the company
which had precipitated the insolvency
proceedings.
Judge Troutt was of the opinion that
there should be some check put upon
the assignee in the disposition of the
stock, and that the objecting creditor
was entitled to protection. He advised
the attorneys for each side to get to
gether and agre: upon an order of sale
to be submitted to him later.
Tivoli Seat Sales Begin.
The sale of reserved seats for the
first week of the Tivoli season of
grand opera will open at the box office
of the theater at 9 o'clock this morn
ing. The prices will range from $2 to
50 cents. The entire company is now
en route from the City of Mexico and
will reach San Francisco in time to
hold a series of rehearsals on the
stage of the Tivoli before the opening
night, which is definitely set for
Wednesday evening, January 11. The
opening opera will be Verdi's "Rigo
letto," which will serve to introduce
Mme. Tettrazzini. It will be followed
by either "Zaza" or "La Tosca," in
which Mme. Berlindi will make her
debut. "The Barber of Seville" and
"Andre Chenier" will complete the
cycle of the first week's perform
ances. The season promises to be a
notable one in San Francisco's grand
opera annals. The Tivoli's great stage
is being put into condition to receive
the invading forces of grand opera
and the very atmosphere of the the
ater is surcharged with music.

& Sachau, proprietors of Faust Hall,
says that in his opinion the intention
of the Savings Bank people is to "re
model," not to destroy and rebuild.
The leejpe reads that the bank must
"build. Messrs. Bauer & Sachau say
that they have never been properly no
tified, and that they have sixty days'
grace, therefore, under the law. The
complications are of a somewhat un
usual nature and the case Is a novel
one.
ROE ESTATE âThe second account of the
administrators of the estate of George H. Roe,
filed yesterday shows receipts for the year
amounting to $67,319 75. of which 125,000 was
derived from the sale of shares in the Elec
trical Engineering Company. The expendi
tures aggregated $26.329.

MRS. MONNIER
MAKES DENIAL
Says That Answers She Gave
in Annulment Suit Were
Unintentionally Wrong
GALLAND ON THE STAND
Swears Addition of Name to
Adoption Paper Was Owing
to Lack of Verification
Sullivan and Roche, the attorneys for
George Monnier, who is suing hia
mother for a share in the estate of his
father, the deceased wine merchant,
had their first opportunity to cross-ex
amine Mrs. Monnier Sr. yesterday, and
during the morning session in Judge
Graham's court elicited several denials
from her as to testimony given at tha
time of young Monnier's annulment
suit.
The break In Mrs. Monnier's testi
mony waa caused by the placing of
Jesse Galland, a deputy sheriff, on the
stand. Galland was studying law at
the time of George Monnier's adoption
and drew up the adoption papers.
Efforts were made by Sullivan and
Roche to cast suspicion on the regu
larity of the signing of the document,
but Galland was able to show that he
withheld the mother's signature from
the paper until he could verify the
spelling of the name. His cross-exam
ination will be continued this morning.
Mrs. Monnier spent a greater part of
the morning, under George D. Collins*
questions, denying the statements mad*
by the witnesses for the contestant as
to her use of vulgar language and ncr
treatment of George, his wife and
children. She said that she had shown
no partiality to either of George's
children, treated them both alike, and
often bought them clothing.
On the completion of Collins' examin
ation, Sullivan took the witness in
hand and attempted to shake her tes
timony as to the questions she an
swered In the suit brought by George
Monnier Jr. for the annulment of his
marriage with Violet. At that time she
alleged that George always had
stomach trouble and that she had
never seen him drunk.
During the present trial she testified
to the contrary and yesterday told
Sullivan that George had stomach
trouble only at intervals and that
when she said she had never seen him
drunk she meant at night time. She
said that she had often seen him in
toxicated during the day. The case will
be continued this morning at 10 o'clock.

THE AFFAIRS OF STATE.
GOVERNOR PARDEE'S excellent message is a business doc- j
ument of great interest to all citizens. It is a disclosure of the |
rapid growth of California and the corresponding expansion
of its public business. The enlightened policy compelled by Governor j
Pardee two years ago has put the State's finances again in good
shape and has overcome the mistaken policy of making the tax levy
less than the appropriations.
To correct this error of the Legislature which preceded the
last has required a large levy and an increase in taxation, but this <
came at a time when the general prosperity of the people bore the |
exaction without appreciable injury. During the last two years the j
State has expended in betterments to the public property the large
sum of $793,943 46. As these betterments were mostly enlargements :
of facilities to accommodate the increasing number of objects of the
State's care, they show a notable increase in our population, out of I
which issue the "classes that must have care or restraint, as well as
that more significant and valuable class that must be provided with
the means of education.
The large amount of tax collections for State revenue, now by |
law compelled to be kept in the State vaults, is a perceptible with- j
drawal of money from circulation and affects business unfavorably
by causing a stringency in the money market. The Governor wisely 1
and forcibly recommends that this policy of hoarding be abandoned
and that the State funds be returned at once to circulation by de- 1
positing them in banks at interest and on proper security. He says
that the amounts now hoarded uselessly to the State and injuriously
to business run from $2,000,000 to $7,000,000, and have averaged for
the last five years $4,000,000. This average at 2 per cent interest j
would return to the State the large sum of $80,000 annual interest, j
That sum would support one of the State institutions, or it might |
be added as an annual accretion to the endowment of our very needy j
State University. The Governor admits that an amendment to the
constitution is necessary to effect this most necessary reform, but
he makes it plain and convincing that whatever measure is necessary
should be taken, and at once, by this Legislature.
Due to the efforts of The Call the last Legislature changed the j
methods of investment of the school funds of the State. The ex- ;
pensive intermediation of brokers was abolished and the Board of
Examiners were empowered to bid directly for bonds, without show
ing a certified check. The message says the effect is noticeable in a 1
closer and better investment of the school fund and an increase in
the rate of interest. The Governor strongly supports the State
militia and deprecates the policy of certain citizens and organizations
that oppose it and seek to put industrial disabilities upon members
of the National Guard.
The message strongly supports our common school system and i
points to the gratifying fact that about one-half of the State revenue
goes to its support. This is something that should appeal to the
pride of all Californians. Education is a restraint upon crime and
misfortune, and the more general it becomes the less will be the cost
of the punitive and eleemosynary institutions. Money spent in the
schools is the wisest of public economy, and the whole State will j
appreciate and remember the Governor's good words for this great- j
est of American institutions.
The State will be glad to see that a considerable portion of the :
message is occupied by a most clear and convincing statement of the
need of tax reform. This is in line with Governor Pardee's inaugural |
and with the policy advocated by the State Grange and supported j
by The Call. The message proposes separation of the assessment
and taxation for support of the State government from the system j
of local revenue entirely. The history of taxation in this State ; s
traced through the old constitution and court decisions, and through
the debates in the convention of 1879. The Governor quotes the
late Samuel M. Wilson, a delegate to the convention that made the
present fundamental law. Opposing the rigidity of the present con
stitutional requirement. Mr. Wilson said: "My individual opinion
is that the constitution should only prescribe that all real estate and
all tangible property should be taxed, and that such taxation shall
be according to value, and that the Legislature shall have, tjeyond
that, the power and discretion of imposing any other tax it may
see fit except a capitation tax. Then the Legislature, in its discre- .
tion, could exact a stamp tax. a tax upon incomes, or a tax upon
anything else, according to the necessities of the State at the time.
That would bÂ£ justice to all and would be more elasticâin a betteÂ«"
condition and more in accordance with the general principles in all
the States of the Union. Jt is not necessary to equal and uniform
taxation that it should be universal."'
The Governor regrets that this wise advice was not taken by 'â¢
the convention, and expresses the general belief now existing, that
the time has come to follow it. and by a more elastic system permit
the State to derive its revenues by indirect taxation, selecting there
for those objects that are not subject to local levy. The makers of the
present constitution sought especially to increase the taxation of
personal prpperty. and therefore indulged in specific definitions of
personal property. B, ut the message says that the results have .
proved disappointing. The last year under the old constitution, the !
personal property taxed was 20 per cent of the whole. It has now
permanently declined to 15 per cent of the whole assessed valuation
of the State.
The elusive capacity of that form of property has enabled !
evasion of the purpose of the constitution. There must beWeform,
and now. By turning over to the State for 'its sole taxation the
forms in which personal property is corporately manifest, and sup- j
porting the State government whoJly by taxation of franchises, li- |
censes and other privileged uses of personal property, each county
and municipality will control its own levy, and not be subject to the
equalization of its assessment to meet the necessities of the State.
The Governor has made the subject and the necessity so clear that
the Legislature cannot well avoid taking action now.
The message is throughout a most satisfactory statement of the
condition of the public interests of the State, and puts the Legisla- j
ture under trustworthy guidance and advice.
THE CALL has nothing to add to its insistence that the United
States Senator should be accorded to Southern California. Every
reason derived from natural politics supports this view of the
matter, and no one has antagonized its propriety. The material
welfare and political peace of the State will be advanced by that
policy. It is right and it is expedient. To insist upon it detracts \
nothing from the candidates of the north. Their aspiration is hon- j
orable and their patriotism will ease the waiting period that must i
needs pass before its; realization. The Republican party is so strong j
in the Legislature and the State that it can afford to do right and be j
just. No party weak or strong can afford to do otherwise, but the j
party is subject to a peculiar call to duty, which we are persuaded it
will heed.
The geographical allotment of the office of Senator is not all
that it should do. California has submerged all past records under
its enormous majority for President Roosevelt. It did this not as f
the expression of a passing fancy, and not altogether as an assertion i
of party strength, and in it there is no idle meaning. California in-!
dorsed the President because the perJple believe in him and desire
the support of his policies. They did this in the full knowledge of
what he stands for, open-eyed to his great purpose to use his four
years of authority in the solution of those problems of commerce and
transportation from which others have flinched. His message cleared
the air and invited the co-operation of the people in effecting re
forms of which all will be the beneficiaries. We say all advisedly
and meaningly, for those who have made these reforms necessary
will benefit from them as much as the people in whose behalf they
are to be made.
This State is peculiarly interested in the issues made by } the
THE SENATORSHIP.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, JANUARY 5. 1905.
IN THE MAID OF
HONOR'S CARRIAGE
THE young man entered the car
riage, banged the door shut and
settled himself comfortably with
a sigh of relief. Opposite him
| sat a pensive young woman ln a be
! wildering gown of fluffy white. The
i young man removed his high hat and
mopped his perspiring brow. He ad
justed his tie and brushed the dust
; from his coat sleeve. The carriage
i rattled briskly over the pavements;
1 outside the early afternoon sunshine
| flooded the streets with a mellow glow.
; "Well," said the . young man,
i straightening himself and smiling at
; the girl, "another good man gone
! wrong. Every time I assist at the
j weddings of these reckless youths I
I feel somehow like an executioner."
| "We're getting to be arch-conspira
| tors in the wedding line, aren't we?"
I the girl laughed. "It seems of late
j that we are thrown together at every
1 one.
"Let's see," he mused, "this is the
third so far this month. We're ac
cumulating a great weight of responsi
i bility."
| "All my friends seem to be going in
j for matrimony," she said.
"Mine, too," he returned cheerfully.
I "Hymen is an indiscriminate old
burglar. He gobbles 'em right and
j left. And when a man's married he's
!as good as lost to his friendsâat first,"
he added.
"But they all come back to the
| club and âand the old life, don't
| tbey?" she said testily.
"Most of them," he admitted.
I "That's the man of it," she said.
"Marriage is a lottery," he said,
lacking momentarily a more original
I " 'Pleasant the snaffles of courtship,
improving the manners and car
riage.' " she quoted.
\ " 'But the colt who is wise will re
frain from the terrible thornbit of
marriage,' " he finished.
"There seems to be a great many
colts lacking wisdom," she remarked.
"And lots more willing to lack that
I commodity." he laughed.
"Doesn't a wedding ever impress
you as rather pathetic?" she asked.
"Always," he replied. "Often heart
rending."
"Well, mine shan't be," she said,
j "It shall be very, very cheerful."
"That's the kind I should prefer for
' myself," he acquiesced.
THE DIVINE PASSION
MAY BURN OR BLESS
BY DOROTHY FENIMORE,
| HAVE been asked by a reader if I
I think that love causes mortals
I more pain than joy, and if it is
â  an unsatisfied longing, like the
dream of happiness.
Love, answer I, is like a light in the
darkness. It burns or it blesses.
The moths who rush into the candle
light find it a scorching flame. To the
shipwrecked man at sea a beacon
means salvation. To the student a light
at night is opportunity, and to the
world at large it is suggestive of home
and fireside happiness.
So, too, with love. Headlong folly in
love results in disaster. Yet love is
hope to the discouraged, faith to the
skeptical, and to the lonely heart it is
the golden key to home.
There are two ways of judging love
âby what men say of it. and by what
you yourself find to be true. Both
these ways are full of prejudice. Take
the latter, for instance. If you have
played the moth you know love as a
flame. If love came to you in the hour
of your despair, you reverence it as a
messenger from heaven. If it has
opened up for you a new world of
poetry and beautiful reality, you will
care for tt as thoughtfully as the wise
virgins of the scriptures tended their
precious lamps. If love meant for you
a sweet companionship, for which, in
the solitude of your secret life you
had eagerly sighed, then you are sure
President. During all of his term as the successor of President Mc-
Kinley he has made plain his purpose in seeking election to a full
term. He is not a ntan of concealments, and does nothing hidden.
This State approves of his purpose to destroy the artificial inequali
ties which are the outgrowth of our enormous progress in production,
commerce and transportation. Reasonable men who are a part of
this artificial incubus upon the individual see the necessity for its
abolition, and will hail it as relief from a burden. In this situation
California should follow her impressive indorsement of the President
by strengthening his hands in the Senate.
We make no insinuation and raise no outcry against any cor
poration, nor against the interests of any capital. We bring no
charge against any influence that may seem apparent in the Sena
torial contest at Sacramento. We are willing to accept all indica
tions that corporations, looking across the conservative prospect pre
sented by the President's views, to that chaos which lies beyond, are
willing to enter into that co-operation to which he invites them. But
we wish to very soberly remind the members of the Legislature that
their public and party duty requires of them the election of a Senator
who will support the President. What they do will go to judgment
upon that proposition. A house cannot stand divided against itself.
The people put the Republican party in power in this State that it
might make good as the powerful supporter of popular rights. If
the Legislature seem to fail to make good in the election of a Senator
no seer is required to foretell the result.
The geographical requirements of the situation, and the strength
ening of the President are consistent with each other. They can
be accomplished at one stroke, and when accomplished the Legisla
tive hand will have written "perpetuity" over the career of the party
as far as it can be inscribed upon anything human.
To do otherwise will be to reach a lame and pitiful conclusion.
To indorse the President at the polls and repudiate him in the Leg
islature will require no explanation. It will be self-explanatory. This
issue is alive in every Republican Legislature that has to elect a
Senator. So far there is in none of them a sign that the party will
throw itself out of line with the President. The party everywhere
seems to be girding itself to make the contest to which he has called
it. Scarcely a note of dissent is heard from the party press. All these
things have keyed up the expectation of the country. Let not Cali
fornia be the first to disappoint it. ,
BY CHARLES GRAVES.
"The service should be short." she
said.
"Just long enough to be legal," he
agreed cheerfully.
"And it would be a very quiet af

"Second the motion," said he.
She looked up quickly, then turned
her eyes and watched the hurrying

"Youâyou haven't railed at

she mused. "The church is too big
and gloomy and solemn. Surely at

simple orchids."
"It's amazing how you voice my
sentiments." said he.
The carriage swung around a cor
ner and entered a more quiet street.
The young man flicked an imaginary
bit of dust from his coal.
"That would be a wedding." he said.
"You'd have an orchestra behind some
to cherish it as tenderly aa did King
Arthur's knight. Geraint. the beloved
lady of his heart, ever seeking
"To compass her with sweet obser
vances.
To dress her beautifully, and keep her
true."
As I look upon it. youth, with its
leaping impulses, its moods of gayety
as light as thistledown, cannot know
the wholeâor even a half âof the
truth about love. A wise and clear
sighted old age is better qualified.
Every day, like bees, we mortals
bring our drops -it honey to the gold
en treasure house of nature's life.
Like them again, we cannot in a sea
son's toil gather more.ieach one of us,
than a siriÃlp teaspoonful. And what
we bring is fragrant of our daily pas
turage. Some of it is sweet with clo
ver and some of it is delicately sharp
with thyme. Part is pale hued like
the flowers from which it was gath
ered and part of it is yellow with the
pollen of the goldenrod.
Let us look at love in yet another
way. It enriches all which it touches
with its Midas fingers. In youth we
are eager to follow love into its cave
of enchantments for the same reason
that in childhood we would like to go
on and on to the spot where the rain
bow touches the earth. It is treasure
we are after, it is all the wonderful
wealth of illusion. When we get older
palms on the broad stairs, wouldn't
you ?"
I'Yes, a string orchestra," she re
plied.
"Of course, of courseâa string or
chestra," said he.
"And a Jolly, informal wedding
breakfast, and punch," she went on.
"That's the idea!" he said approv
ingly.
And every one who wept should be
fined five dollars," she said.
"Make it ten," he suggested. "Or
thirty days in the House of Correc
tion. The crime would warrant It"
She laughed gayly.
"It wouldn't be a somber affair, I'll
warrant you," she asserted.
"I'll bet it wouldn't," he said en
thusiastically.
He mopped his brow nervously and
looked covertly at the girl opposite
him. Her eyes were still turned from
him.
"I'd like to try a wedding of that
sort," he said.
"There wouldn't be any ushers," she
remarked pointedly.
"Certainly riot." he said. "I fully
realize that. I'd like to try it asâas
bridegroom."
"Why don't you?" she asked faintly.
"Well, I would if I were sure of the
girl," he said. "You see " He
paused.
"I'm afraid I don't see," she said
laughingly.
"You sec, there's only one girl I
want, and I don't dare ask her," he
said plaintively.
"Indeed!"' she said coldly.
"There's only one girl I want," he
repeated desperately, "and she's the
one who has heard me rail at wed
dings from time immemorial. I'm
afraid she would'nt believe I was
serious."
The girl's face grew very red.
"You âyou haven't railed at this
imaginary one," she said without turn
ing her eyes.
In an instant he was on the seat be
side her.
"Then she will marry me?" he asked
softly.
The girl pressed her hot face against
the window of the carriage.
"You said you thought marriage
was aâa lottery." she faltered.
"Well," he said stoutly. "who
wouldn't risk a lottery chance if he
knew he would draw the capital
prize?"

Spencer C. Buckbee said William
T. Coleman deserved well of the
btate when it was deciding whom to
honor. Coleman twice headed the
Vigilance Committee. He was a man
â¢ut broad views and great enterprise.
His courage was conspicuous and his
services were of inestimable value at
a time when resolute leadership was
indispensable. He represented a cer
tain era. Californians were particu
larly interested in perpetuating the
memories of deeds of men who have
lived in the State since the American
occupation. For this reason Mr.
Buckbee said that the selection should
include oniy men who have partici
pated in California affairs since the
date of that occupation. Mr. Buck
bee's second choice was the Rev.
Thomas Starr King.
.. . Oscar F. Sites, manager of the
Palace Hardware Company, strongly
.favored giving a statue to Padre Ju
nipero Serra, whom he estimated to
have been a very great man and po
tential in the history of California.
â¢Mr. Sites also said William T. Cole
man was deserving of fame.
W. H. Mills said that Collis P. Hun
tington did more for California in a
material, way than any other man, and
he therefore favored Huntington.
Professor Joseph Le Conte, Mr. Mills
said, was better known to the world
.at large, by reason of his scientific
achievements, than any other Califor
nian. It was due to Huntington that
the first transcontinental railway was
'constructed. He raised the money.
It followed as a consequence that the
United States should in time become
a larsre factor in the commerce of
the Orient. Huntington's great ser
vice to California was that he merged
the State with the other parts of the
country. Before the railway was
built California was principally a
mining State. Wheat was exported,
but other products were grown prin
ipally to supply the mines. The rail
way alone opened up a way to reach
markets. Huntington and Le Conte
were Mr. Mills' selections.
â¢Vttorney William Thomas named
Padre Junipero Serra and the Rev.
Thomas Starr King, and said that
were both representative of im
portant periods and connected with
important happenings in the history
of California. He favored them as
subjects for statues.

THE POST DISCOVERY.
A HÂ« \olatipn in Human Food.
Prey . p tn the discovery of the Post j
process cf ( hanging the starchy part of
Wheat arid Barley into a form of su- j
â  gar, many people suffered from what is i
known as starch indigestion.
That \\a.< shown by gas and all sotSs j
of stomach and bowel trouble (some
times ending in appendicitis) brought]
on by the undigested starch in wheal,
oats, white bread, cake, puddings, etc.
Nature ultimately punishes any one
vho continually takes some medic me
or drug to smooth ..ver or nulllfv bad
conditions of the body. The only safe
way to cure such is to correct or re- j
move the cause. Therefore it was plain
to Mr. Post, in working out his dis- !
covery, that people who show some ;
weakness in digesting the starchy part I
of food (which is mu> h the largest
part of all we eat) must be helped
by having the starch digested or trans
. formed before being eaten. And of
course the safest and truest way to do j
' this would be to imitate nature and
avoid all chemicals or outside and un
'.natural things. The body digests the
starchy food by the following process:
First it is mixed with the moisture or
'juices of the mouth and stomach, then
warmth or mild heat from the body
grows or deveiops disease from the
grain. Time is also an important tie

COURT DECIDES
AGAINST SCOTT
The final chapter of the once noted
Sheehan-Scott case closed yesterday,
when the Supreme Court decided that
the plaintiff, Edward L Sheehan, was
entitled to the office of Tax Collector
of this city and county. But as the
term of office has expired more than
three years ago, Sheehan will receive
no other satisfaction than that of se
curing a Judgment over Scott.
J. H. Scott was elected Tax Collec
tor on November 7, 1599. Sheehan held
the office and claimed Scott had no
right to it. Sheehan made an attempt
to keep Scott from entering upon his
duties. He tried every means and all
but resorted to violence, in the mean
time bringing suit in the Superior
Court.
Sheehan alleged that Scott was not
entitled to the office on the ground
that he had not been a resident of the
city and county for a period of five
years as provided in the charter. Scott
fought the case bitterly and many
months after the suit was brought
judgment was rendered in favor of
Sheehan by Superior Judge Seawell.
In the meantime. Scott managed to
hold the office, although Sheehan did
everything possible to oust him. When
Judge Seawell decided in Sheehan's
favor, Scott appealed the case to the
Supreme Court. By this time the
office had nearly expired, but through
influence and technicalities Scott still
retained his position.
Now the Supreme Court comes forth
and sustains the verdict handed down
by Judge Seawell. In the meantime
two other Tax Collectors have held
office since and both Sheehan and
Scott are practically dead politi
cally. Scott was elected to the office,
served out his term and drew down
his salary regularly. Sheehan con
tested the case, got a verdict in two
courts, but never drew a cent of salary
nor had the pleasure of ousting his
opponent.
Inasmuch as the Supreme Court haa
decided that a man who does the work
gets the salary. Sheehan is not entitled
to anything under the law. Still, two
; courts have ruled that the office is
, rightfully his, but now that other
i parties are in control and other elec
tions have been held, Sheehan must
be satisfied with the honor of securing
| two Judicial victories.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, * JANUARY 5, 1905.
LOWE'S MEMORY
IS DEFECTIVE
Witness in Dunsmuir Case
Cannot Remember WTien
Questioned by Judge Coyne
FILE NOTICE OF MOTION
Mrs. Hopper's Attorneys, in
Formal Document, Bring
Case to Superior Court
"I don't remember" waa the answer
given to nearly every question of im
portance put to J. A. 8. Lowe by Judge
j Coyne during the taking of testimony
;in the Dunsmuir case yesterday morn
ing. On some points the witness
j would answer positively "Yes" or
! "No," but on the majority of questions
! put to him his mind was a blank.
James Peter Taylor, also a witness
to the will, was before the commission
; yesterday. His testimony was greatly
!at variance with that given by Lowe
lon Tuesday. A mild sensation was
sprung when Sir Charles H. Tupper pro
j duced before the commission a floor
plan diagram of the Agnew residence
| ln Oakland, where the will was signed.
Lowe was the first witness called
i yesterday. Judge Coyne took him in
; hand and put up a vigorous cross-ex
! amlnation. Lowe was non-committal.
:He took refuge in the statement "I
, don't remember" to nearly every ques
i tion asked him. The question of com
; pensatlon for his services was brought
|up for bis trip from England here. He
, said he had not been promised any
: specific sum, but he thought $20 a day
would be what his services were worth,
and he thought c.:iÂ»* representatives of
James Dunsmuir would pay him this
amount.
LOWE'S MEMORY.
Judge Coyne asked Lowe concerning
a certain letter that he (Lowe) had
! shown to Mr. Avery on the Sausaiito
j boat last Saturday morning. Lowe
could not remember anything about the
letter. After a terrific hammering from
Judge Coyne, Lowe was compelled to
admit that he had the letter referred
to, but could not remember anything
more about it. He further admitted
that the letter was from his wife, but
he positively declined to give its con
tents. He also said that he could not
remember having discussed the ques
tion of seeing an attorney to coach him
in the case. Finally Judge Coyne, in a
j fit of desperation, said: "Is there any
; thing you do remember?" "Yes,"
j Lowe replied, "I remember that I had
breakfast this morning." "Now Vr.
'. Lowe," said Judge Coyne, "do you re
i member going to the office of Mr.
: Thorne this morning at 10 o'clock?"
"Yes," said Lowe.
"What happened there?" queried
Judge Coyne.
L "I don't remember," replied Lowe.
"Do you pretend to tell me, sitting
here under oath before this commis
sion, that you do not know what hap
pened in Mr. Thome's office this morn
ing only about twenty minutes ago?"
"I don't remember," was Lowe's re
ply.
! "And I suppose that this testimony
you are giving now is as true as all the
rest of the testimony you have given
before this commission?" asked Judge
Coyne. "Yes," replied Lowe. This
wound up the morning session.
James Peter Taylor, a prominent coal
merchant, testified to the same effect
as he did during the trial of the case In
Victoria, B. C.
Kis statements regarding the doings
and movements of James and Alexan
der Dunsmuir, Lowe and himself, on
the night of the signing of Alexander's
< will, were entirely different from the
, statements made by Lowe on Tues
day.
POINTS TO DIAGRAM.
Ti ylor pointed out with accuracy on
the diagram the position in the parlor
of the Agnew home where the docu
! ment was signed. He declined posi-
I lively and emphatically to make a
I mark on the diagram but he put his
j finger on the spot in question. In the
testimony of Lowe on Tuesday, from a
drawing made by himself, he indicated
an exact opposite position in the room.
Albert James Bain, the architect who
drew up the floor plan of the Agnew
home, testified to his visit to that place,
and went minutely into a description
of the premises.
The further hearing of testimony will
take place Saturday morning at 10:30.
Edna Wallace Hopper's attorneys,
Campbell, Metson & Campbell, yester
day formally liled the notice, which
they had served on <he attorneys for
James Dunsmuir of their intention to
move on January 6 for a revocation of
the judgment of May 9, 1900, admitting
the will of Alexander Dunsmuir to pro
bate and appointing James Dunsmuir
as executor. The motion is to be based
upon the grounds that the court did not
have jurisdiction of the suhject-matter
of the estate nor of the persons inter
ested. The affidavits of Sir Charles
Hibbert Tupper and Edward P. Coyne,
regarding the proceedings in British
Columbia, are attached to the notice.
The O'Connor-Moffatt Sale.
The big alteration sale inaugurated hy
i O'Connor, Moffatt & Co. incident to the
' enlargement of their store is proving an
immense success. This is the first sale
. of a special nature held by the firm stnee
its great fire sale in 1883. The premises
have been so crowded with bargain seek
ers since last Thursday that the services
of police officers have been called into
requisition to regulate the movements of
the crowds. Officers Douglass and Ma
loney have been specially detailed for
this work and their good nature and
efficiency have called for general com
mendation. Notwithstanding the diffi
culty in getting to the sales counters,
the great reductions made and the high
class of goods offered have proven a suf
ficient attraction to keep buyers on hand.

A beginning was made in Judge Sea- ;
well's court yesterday in the trial of
the case of Charles Main against
Thomas R. Hayes, personally and aa
executor of the will of his son, C. E.
Hayes, to recover 600 shares of stock in
the Standard Portland Cement Com
pany. The plaintiff, a member of the
firm of Main & Winchester, is 87 years
old. THe defendant went into the
firm's employ fifty-one years ago. For
the last ten or twelve years of his
service he was Main's confidential
agent, privileged to make investments
for him without question.
According to the complaint, in Sep
tember, 1902, Hayes bought fifteen of
the cement company's bonda during
Main's absence in the East and upon
Main's return, at his request, bought
five more. In January of this year,
Main says, he discovered that Hayes
and his son had received and withheld
600 shares of the company's stock
which were given as a bonus with the
bonds. The stock is declared to be
worth $45.0f10.
Hayes was on the stand and remem
bered tbe transaction and admitted
that the stock was issued ln his name
or that of his son. but he did not reach
an explanation as to his claim of
ownership, which was set forth ln his
answer to the complaint. He was with
drawn as a witness in order that the
prosecution might lay a foundation for
questions along that line by proving
the issuance of the stock by the evi
dence of the secretary of the com
pany. Then the case was continued
until next Monday morning.
One of the contentions in the answer
of Hayes is that $5000 worth of the
bonds were purchased for Main's
granddaughter, with her money. Main
in his deposition denies this strenu-
OUSIy and says that she has not a far
thing's interest in the security, al
though he might have intended to give
her the bonds later. A letter to him
from Hayes showed that there was an
entry in a certain book stating that the
bonds belonged to Mrs. Crawford's ac
count. In regard to this, Mr. Main
makes an interesting explanation. He
says Hayes kept his books and handled
his private affairs without question.
Main had implicit confidence in
Hayes and relied upon his judgment.
A great many years ago. when Main s
granddaughters were little children, he
started a separate account for them
and from time to time added to it in
the way of money and securities. In
the case of Mrs. Crawford, he says, her
account had reached $50,000 when she
married and with this she bought a lot
and built a home in Washington, D. C.
The aged plaintiff says that when he
found that stock had been given as a
bonus with the bonds he wrote to
Hayes about it and the latter denied
that it had been so issued; this, says
Main, was a source of great surprise to
him. The defense maintains that when
the stock was issued it was not worth
more than $6000 and is now valued at
only half of what the plaintiff alleges it
to be.

MINERS RESCUE
ENTOMBED MAN
Strikes Old Fill With His
Pick and the Falling Dirt
Shuts Him in Small Niche
IMPRISONED FOR HOURS
Sufficient Air Enters Cave
to Sustain Life Until His
Companions Dig Him Out
REDDING, Jan. 4.âGeorge Garwood,
Justice of the Peace of French Gulch,
was burled alive for nine hours to
day. Garwood and two partners have
a lease on the Pick-up mine in the
French Gulch district. The Judge was
at work to-day running an upraise to
connect one tunnel with another, when
suddenly his pick struck an old fill and
the fine dirt poured down on him, luck
ily leaving him in a niche in the wall.
In a twinkling he was shut ln with
barely room enough to turn around.
When his partners learned of the acci
dent they rushed to the Washington
mine near by, where they got the en
tire force of twenty miners to help
them dig Garwood out. It took the
miners nine hours, working in five
minute shifts, to rescue the imprisoned
man. They found him all right, as
sufficient air reached him through the j
old fill to keep him alive, and the cave- j
in had not injured him.

CONDEMNED
MAN MAKES
CONFESSION
Lain OWil. Alias LUpton,
Who Is to Be Hanged Next
Friday, Assumes All Blame
for the Mathews Bobbery
TRIES TO ASSIST
TWO OTHEB FELONS
Says That Mike and Docia
Nolan, Who Are Undergo
ing Long Sentences for the
Crime, Are Both Innocent
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 4.âLarry O'Nell,
alias George Lupton, alias Henry Mil
ton, who is to be hanged Friday at
San Quentin, has made a confession,
ln which he tries to exonerate Mike
Nolan and Docia Nolan from any con
nection with the robbery of Mrs.
Mathews on March 4, 1903. in her home
in San Francisco, for which crime both
the Nolans are undergoing long terms
of imprisonment.- O'Nell handed to
Warden Tompkins to-day a closely
written document of three pages which
ho calls his "confession." It begins:
"1,. Henry Milton, being of sound mind
and knowing that I am auout to die,
do exonerate Mike and Docia Nolan
from any connection with the robbery
oÂ£ Mrs. Mathews." He then sets forth
that his first acquaintance with Mike
and Docia Nolan was after his incar
ceration in the County Jail for the
murder of James Gillice. He knew
neither of the Nolans before that. *He
says he entered the house of Mrs.
Mathews with two confederates, whose
names he does not give, because he
does not want to involve them. It was
O'Neil, according to tne confession,
that entered the house and locked the
door and not Nolan. O'Neil says noth
ing as to who gave Mrs. Mathetvs the
terrible beating or who made the de
mand upon her for her valuables. His
next statement is that he was the last
one to leave the house and jump over
the back fence. The rest of the state
ment is rather disconnected and bears
reference to certain features of the
crime without telling the story of the
crime in its natural order. Herbert
Popplewell, the messenger boy, he as
serts was correct in his statement that
he saw Nolan and spoke to him at the
corner of Haight and Fillmore streets,
but how Milton knows this he does not
state. He denounces Ruby Grill's story
of the conspiracy between Docia and
Mike Nolan as perjury and insists that
Mrs. Mathews was mistaken in her tes
timony that Nolan was in her house
and struck her. When No;an was on
his way to receive his sentence from
Judge Cook Milton says ne was then
ready md willing to confess, but his
cellmates told him if he did he would
surely be hanged so he kept silent.
Milton's offense, for which he has
been condemned to death, was the mur- \
der of James Gillice, an aged saloon- <
keeper, April 15. 1903. Gillice had closed
his saloon and was walking along
Ninth street, near Market, when Mil
ton held him up Gillice resisted the
attempt to rob him and Milton shot
him in the groin. Milton did not
escape, horVever, for Gililce held him
until the police arrived. Gillice died
the following day.
Captain of Detectives Burnett places
no confidence in the story told by
O'Neil for the reason that Nolan
pleaded guilty to the robbery of Mrs.
Matthews. Captain Burnett thinks the
confession is only a ruse to help Nolan
now that O'Neil knows there is no sal
vation for himself.

The Lumber Market.
. Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says of lum
'â¢'.ber:
"The year just closed has been a memor
able one for both redwood and the product
.â¢ of Oregon and Washington mills. While the
'.manufacturers of redwood have succeeded in
-matatainlng prices and making money, the
â .mills of the Northwest have not done as well.
They have had several depressing Influences.
First, there was an overproduction, the for
' elgn or offshore demand tailing to almost
."nothing; and second, the freight rate to the
Missouri River was almost prohibitive.
â¢At the close of 19C3 the prioe of Oregon
â¢ lumber was $10 20; It closed 1904 at $7 30
â¢ for rough, which was really below the cost
of manufacture. Many of the larger mills
â¢ wisely closed down, preferring to wait until
'a' demand springs up. which it is piedlcted
will come early In the season, aa It Is hoped
that, the large stocks in Australia and the
island,, of the Pacific will be worked off and
. orders- again flood the market.
â¢ "California has had a prosperous year and
. alf oVOf the State fair prieea for lumber
';have prevailed. At Los Angeles there has
'been a rather slow year. Large quantities
â¢of lumber have beon disposed of, but there j
has been a cut In prices that has naturally
resulted In a loss to the handlers of both
' nine and redwood.
"Th* mountain mills have done well and
on the whole have had a prosperous year.
..V great showing will be made .in mountain
pine In .1905. and if thcrailroada deal.Justly
'with- the millmen the East will receive
..a.'Rood supply, not only of redwood, but sugar
'{15.i yellow pine. Shingles have done well.
The new year opens well for all concerned and
. j>roiÂ»perts are very bright. ThÂ« lumbermen ot
nhe eras' have every reason to expect great
thine? of 1906."

' â¢ Now York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.âThere was a decided
" abatement of speculative Interest in stocks,
â  and a resulting heavy Irregular tone ln the
â¢day's dealings. To some extent this was un
doubtedly due to the fear that the advances
â¢ of yesterday were too fast a pace for the health
of. the market. There was a perceptible sen
sitiveness also to the constant fluctuations in
Amalgamated Copper, which continues to bo
.regarded as & danger point by a large element
among the operators since their experience a
few weeks ago. The threatening utterances
â¢from the same source as at the time of the
previous break in the stock keepe alive this
..spirit of apprehension. The stimulating ef
. feet of the Northern Securities decision had
lost some of Its force to-day, and Northern
' Securities on the curb and all the stocks re
lated to it on the exchange were reactionary.
It Is taken for granted that plans are far ad
vanced toward an agreement. But there is a
remaining force in the consideration that the
. terms fixed for the redistribution of the prop
erties In the merger will end the control se
cured by the Union Pacific of the old North
ern Pacific, thus in a measure relegating con
. dfti >ns to the same state as that existing be
fore the colossal contest between the mag
. nates of the railroad world In 1901. There
was an Inclination to depend more upon the
expected January Investment demand for secur-.
itles. Thia proved to be of moderate propor
tions and was met by offerings on the part -
of the dealers, who had taken stocks ln an
ticipation of this demand. There were sus
taining points in the market, however, which
held prices against any severe reaction. New
" York Central was notably strong and reports
persisted of a large Interest concerned In this
property by Union Pacific and Standard Oil
interests, which would tend to harmonise its
operation with other railroad properties. The
. "marked buying for London account was felt
as. yesterday. The offering of the Irish land I
purchase loan absorbed a large Interest in that
market, and preparatione for the Russian loan
â¢ o,i the Continent formed another deterrent in
;â  ftuence. The money market here continued
extremely easy, but the rate of the goH outgo i
â  was of some sentimental influence on the stock !
market. In addition to the week's export* to
Fiance and South America it waa intimated !
that gold was likely to be shipped from San ,
Francisco to Japan on account of deposits â 
at the New York Sub-Treasury. The only oc
. casion that can call for shipments to Japan
st this time would be on account of New York
subscriptions on the Japanese loan. It is in
â  terestlng to recall that at the time of the last
â  Russian loan It was alleged that its flotation
â¢ was facilitated by reason of disbursements In
, the world's markets of drafts on deposits in 1
â¢European banks of the proceeds of the former
â¢ Japanese loan. The calling borne by Japan
- ot Its foreign deposits would promise a con
trary effect. *
- v R alltoad net earnings reported for Novem
ber showed good increases, an important In
nance being Union Pacific. The reactionary
tendency in the market, however, prevailed,
find the close was weak.
so NÂ°nds were easy. Total sales, par ralue,
Pnited States bonds were unchanged on call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Jan. 4.âlnfluenced by higher ca
bles and an Improvement in cash demand for
both wheat and flour, the wheat market opened
firm. May was up %c to %o%c at $114% to
$1 14%0>114%. Commit on houses were fair
buyers. Many of yesterday's sellers reinstated
their ltnea during the first few minutes of trad
ing. At the time offerings were comparatively
light, and among the reasons for the tenjaclty
of tbe longs was the bullish crop report. Aa
the day advanced pit traders sold more freely,
but the market eased off considerably, May de
clining to $118%. During the last part of tbe
session, however, sentiment again became bull
ish. Southwestern reports denote practical ex
haustion of winter wheat. Kansas City and St-
Louis to-day only receiving 91.000 bushels.
Total primary- receipts are little more than one
half what they were a year ago. The princi
pal factor, however in the late situation was a
decrease of 2,561,000 bushels in the world's
available stocks. The market closed at prac
tically the highest point of the day. Final
quotations on May were at 91 14%Â©1 14%.
Liberal receipts and a large increase in the
world's visible supply made sentiment ln the
corn pit bearish. May opened unchanged to %c
lower at 44%044%c, sold off to 44% c and
closed at the opening price.
Weakness of corn was the governing factor
of the oate market. May opened a shade to
%o%c lower at 8l'Â«'5:n l l c and rallied within
the opening range, the close being at 31 %c.
â Provisions were weak throughout the entire
sesskin. At the close all May products were
off 17>4c.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT âThe foreign markets showed no
particular change. Chicago was %c higher on
the day. The car shortage is now passing
away, as shown by the following dispatch
from Chicago:
"Practically all the Eastern roads were in
the grain trade yesterday, offering cars for
immediate loading. One shipping house re
ported to have been offered 200 cars and sim
ilar tenders were made to many. The Eastern
roads are beginning to get back the first rush
of cars sent forward early In December. From
a condition amounting practically to a block
ade appearance in the December rush to the
railroads we now see a period of dullness
ahead."
In this market futures were higher, with the
May shorts anxious to cover, but sellers scarce.
The cash grain was steady and unchanged.

Hay and FeedstutTs.
Rolled Barley is slightly higher with the
raw grain. Bran is In light supply and very
firm. The situation in Hay Is thus expressed
ln the circular of Somers & Co.:
"For the past two weeks receipts of Hay
have been very light, but 1950 tons arriving
last week and 1970 tons the week before. This
somewhat meager supply, however, has
sufficient to meet all demands, for throughout
the holidays trade has been quiet and there
has been but little of interest to report.
"During the last fortnight two vessels have
cleared for Oriental ports, taking perhaps twr
thousand tons of Hay. But stocks on storage
ln San Francisco have been heavy and these
shipments have had little effect other than to
reduce them, the shippers not having to go on
the market to secure the Hay. The United
States Government has just been in the market
for 1000 tons for prompt shipment, but even
this we think, will have little or no effect
on market conditions especially since the
entire State has had a good rain, giving us
some assurance of good crops next season.
"The United States Weather Bureau re
ports plowing and seeding still tn progress
and good prospects for a large acreage of Hay
and grain. Green feed Is still abundant and
with a continuance of favorable conditions we
cannot expect to see much of a change In
market conditions."

continued to drag at irregular prices. Re

tiful, and prices were without quotable change.
Onions were quiet and weak at the previously
quoted rates.
Receipts of southern vegetables were light

matoes were still plentiful and slow of sale,

young chickens leading In point of demand.
A car of Western wss marketed, making the
fourth for the week and another car was
hourly expected. Eight cases of dressed Tur
keys came In and met with quick sale at
good prices. Aside from a slight decline in

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The situation ln Butter remains about as re
ported early In the week. It Is weak and
dull, with stocks plentiful and buyers indiffer
ent and the market against the seller. Some
houses are disposed to reduce their creameries
lc to work off their stocks, while others con
tinue to quote the old figures. There Is no
snap whatever to the market. The medium
goods are lower. Cheese is easy and quiet.
Eggs are weak and declining, though the
downward tendency is gradual. Some houses
still quote 40c but they are ln the minority
and are getting fewer every day. Any posted
buyer can now buy fine ranch Eggs at 350
37 %c, and it takes a special Egg to bring over
39c. Stocks are not especially heavy, but. are
Increasing, and it is this that is depressing
the market.
Receipts were 21.400 lbs Butter, 662 cases
Eggs and 7800 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Trade in Oranges continued quiet yesterday
and jobbers manifested but little Interest In
the auction sale. Eight cars of Navels,
chiefly choice and fancy fruit, were offered
and less than one car was purchased by out
siders, the balance being bought ln by the
auction company. Following were the prices
obtained: Extra fancy Navels $1 5502; or
dinary fancy, $1 5001 75; choice. $1 2001 50;
standards, $1 08Â© 1 15. The other Citrus fruits
were quiet and featureless. The situation in
Apples was unchanged, the market being firm
and active. A carload fruit came in
from the Hood River district of Southern Ore
gon. Some fancy yellow Newtown Pippins
sold at $1 5001 75. but for the general market
$1 25 was still regarded as an extreme figure.

lectins twelve. It was also decided to ,
call -00 citizens to serve on the petit ;
juries.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 5, 1905.
ATHLETIC MANIA
ROUTS PEACE.
Invades an Apartment House
and Tranquillity Flees.
First-Floor Matron Hales Scion of
Second Floor Into Court. -
A more tranquil apartment-house
than 3637 Nineteenth street was not
in San Francisco when a scion of the
family of Newberger, occupying the
second story, became possessed of a
mania for indulgence in indoor ath
letics.' From that moment comfort
fled the home of the Gfrerers, on th*
first floor. If a quartz mill or a boil
er factory had been in operation over*
; head the Gfrerers' peace could not
j have been more routed.
Such was the complaint of Mrs,
! Lizzie Gfrerer, who appeared before
! Police Judge Fritz as prosecutrix ol
I 18-year-old Will Newberger. and'ehe
had about half a dozen feminine heads
of other families resident at 3637
Nineteenth street to testify that she
did not exaggerate her grievance. She
made young Will the defendant be
cause she had reason to believe that
he was the chief offender. It was his
dally and nightly wont, she averred,
to acquire wind and muscle by means
|of punching the air bag, skipping the
j rope, tossing the medicine ball, clout
ing the sand sack, wrestling and box
ing with shadowy or real adversaries
and performing various and sundry
other violent physical exercises that
vibrated the floor and made her dread
that any moment the ceiling might de
scend and crush her, to say nothing of
| the aural annoyance caused by the
trampling and shuffling of the youth'j
, feet. It was not until she had ex
| hausted remonstrance that the law's
I aid was solicited by her. No, she was
I not opposed to the pursuit of physical
; culture, either as a hygienic measure
{or as a means of pastime, but she be
' lieved there was reason in all things
I and that the student, of athletics
[ should be compelled to consider the
convenience of other folk as well as
i his own enjoyment. It was Master
l Newberger's right to promote h's
I health and upbuild his physique, but
i rot at the expense of his neighbors'
| nerves. Why didn't he establish his
gymnasium where it would not be a
' constant source of irritation to every
j other person in the same building?
| Then the Newbergers informed the
i court that in 3637 Nineteenth street
there were more harassing things than
! Will's athletic performancesâMrs.
i Gfrerer's tongue, for exampleâwhich
I they had witnesses to prove. But none
,of the waiting and willing witnesses
for either side was called. After sur
; veylng the two groups of ladies ihe
court inquired if the landlord of 3637
were present and when that gentle
-1 man strode to the bench and bowed
j his Honor said:
"I'll have to ( pass the task pf set
j tling this contention up to you. As
the owner of the house you know
which of the partiesâthe Newbergers
or the Gfrerersâyou prefer as ten
ants, and I would suggest that you rii
your premises of the least desirable
of the two families as speedily as pos
sible. For It is apparent to me that
the breach between them is un
bridgeable and that no house can
harbor both of them and quietude."
The landlord's acquiescent nods in
dicated that he shared the Judge's
opinion.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Joseph Smith, charged with the mur
der of Joseph McGowan, told his ver
sion of the tragedy to Judge Mogan.
He disclaimed recollection of the actual
killing, but remembered that McGowan
and he had wordy altercation ere the
latter entered the yard in which the
shooting occurred.
"Why don't you remember the shoot
ing?" the Judge Inquired.
"Did you never see a man knocked
out?" was the answer, delivered with
show of* temper. "I had been drink
ing and was dazed. No, I don't re
member how many drinks I took that
dayâdon't know whether I took ten or
a hundred."
Several times the attorney for the
defense, ex-Judge D. J. Murphy, ob
jected to the prosecution's line of
questioning in the course of cross
examination, and on each occasion the
defendant angrily declared that he
wanted to answer. Finally the Judge
told him that his manner was "very
offensive" and did not tend to help his
case.
"Well, I don't like to have these attor
neys interrupting and stopping me
when I want to speak," waa the surly
response.
The cross-examination will be re
sumed this morning.

as co-defendant with George Kennedy,
a waiter at the same playhouse, on the
charge of having drugged and robbed
W. A. Williams, an Arizonan, of $1400
last Sunday night. Mr. Williams, a
little man with an ascetic face, had a
beclouded recollection of what hap
pened after he had absorbed a few
beverages ordered by the fair Lillian
at his. expense. He would not swear
that either she or the waiter took his
money. All he was positive of was
that it was missing when he awoke in
a Fourth street lodging-house, whither
he was transferred from the theater
in a cab ordered by Kennedy. The

James Kelly, born of full-blooded
Ethiopian parents in Limerick, Ire

fore Judge Mogan on the same old
charge of vagrancy and was given
three months' imprisonment after he
had despairingly daunted a ferry ticket
as documentary proof of his intent to
immediately leave for Oakland if tho
court would restore him to freedom.
Bailiff Hlckey, who also first saw light
on the banks of the Shannon, chuckled
with malignant glee as he shoved the
despondent man of color back into the
cage.
The arresting policeman testified that
he scooped In Mr. Kelly from the post
office, where he was extending compli
ments of the holiday season and en
deavoring to obtain a gratuity of one
dime from each person who was so
indiscreet as to hearken to him. In his

KOWALSKY FAST
WITH HIS FISTS
Attorney Participates in
Lively Encounter With Ar
thur Meadows in Court
LANDS BLOW ON FACE
Belligerents Apologize and
Justice of Peace Lawson
Reads Them Harsh Lecture !
Colonel Henry L Kowalsky and
| Arthur Meadows figured in a lively en- ]
counter yesterday in the courtroom of
Justice of the Peace Lawson, in which
Meadows came out second best. The j
Incident occurred just before the trial I
of the suit of J*. A. Miller, as Meadows' j
assignee, to recover $299 99 from Ko
walsky, alleged to be due from certain j
patent letter street signs. The court
room was full of spectators waiting for j
Judge Lawson to appear.
Kowalsky and Meadows were seated
near each other and began to discuss
the case. Kowahjky said something
which angered Meadows, who there
upon reviled Kowalsky and at
the same time rushed threateningly
toward him. The latter, despite his
300 pounds avoirdupois, was too quick,
however. Rising quickly, he gave
Meadows a blow between the eyes
straight from the shoulder. Blood
streamed from Meadows' face and a
lively scrimmage ensued, in which sev- I
eral bystanders took part. Women J
screamed and Judge Lawson rushed
In from his chambers, when the dis- '
turbance ended as if by magic. Law- I
son immediately ordered the belliger- j
ents in the custody of a Sheriff's dep- j
uty. Meadows apologized to the ladies |
present for his language and Kowalsky
seid it was the first time during twen- I
ty-four years' practice that he had fig
tired in such an experience, which
was all the more to be regretted as
he is about to depart for Europe for
an indefinite visit. He said the provo
cation was great, but asked that Judge i
Lawson mete out whatever punish- ,
ment he deemed just. Lawson read 1
the offenders a severe lecture and
afterward dismissed Miller's suit with- i
out prejudice.

Miss Pauline Jackson wanted to know
if a lady had not as much right to wel
come the New Year on Broadway street
as on Market street, and when Judge
Mogan answered the query by sentenc
ing her to three months' imprisonment. \
she turned to another lady awaiting |
trial on a different charge and ex- j
claimed, "AVell, my Gawd! Ain't that
enough to kill ye?"
But it wasn't simply for greeting;
1905 that Miss Jackson was sentenced ;
so heavily. Her method of greeting I
and her character had much to do with
the fixing of the penalty. She dashed
a handful of confetti against the august
countenance of Patrolman Daggett and
also smote his left cheek with a pig
bladder, dried and inflated and attach
ed to the end of a cane. Several prior
convictions for disorderly conduct did ,
the rest for Miss Jackson.

PROVES KEELEY
WAS IN HOUSE
Police Serjeant Sylvester
j Gives Valuable Evidence
i in the Metcalfe Inquest
. i
Important testimony was given yes
terday by Police Sergeant Daniel Syl- |
vester at the inquest on the body of
Edward Bruce Metcalfe, who was shot
and killed 1 at 18 Seventh street on the
morning of December 29, presumably
ty Edward Pierce Keeley, the para
mour of the dead man's wife. Mrs.
Annie Metcalfe, the widow, had Just
testified denying that she had told the
police that Keeley did the shooting.
She said that she supposed it might
have been Keeley.
Sergeant Sylvester said that he
found Metcalfe dead on the floor of
room 8 and Mrs. Metcalfe sitting on the
edge of the bed in room 6. She was
attired only in her undershirt- The'
lower part of her body was covered
with a bedspread, and on the spread
was the bloody imprint of a bare foot.
The witness said that he talked with
the woman in that room for an hour
and a half or two hours and that she
told him that Keeley had shot her hvfc
band. She had first inquired whether
her husband was dead and when told
that he was she declared that she
would not tell the witness anything.
When he asked her where the revolver
was Mrs. Metcalfe replied that he
should catch Keeley and probably he
would find where the weapon was.
The witness then testified that he
went to 603 Eddy street, where Keeley
and Mrs. Metcalfe had roomed. There
he was informed by two persons whose
names he declined to divulge that
shortly after the shooting Keeley had
come to his room and told them that
he had killed Metcalfe. They said also
that Keeley changed his clothing for
a blouse and overalls and left the
he use.
The witness added tnat he had
learned that the revolver had been
given to Keeley by a man who was'l
afraid that his wife would commit sui
cide and who therefore did not like to
have the weapon lying around.
Mr. and Mrs. Charles T. Byrne, who
occupied a room directly opposite that
in which Metcalfe had been killed, tes
tified that they heard the sound of
angry voices, a scuffle, the report of a
pistol and footsteps of some one run
ning down the hall. Mrs. Byrne found
Mrs. Metcalfe sitting on the bed near
her husband's body. When she asked
Mrs. Metcalfe what" was the matter
she received a profane reply. Then*
Mrs- Metcalfe wrapped a sheet about
her and went into the hall.
The inquest will be resumed this
morning.
