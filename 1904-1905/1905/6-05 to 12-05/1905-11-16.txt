Whereas, Reports of terrible outrages perpetrated upon the poor
and defenseless people of the Jewish faith in Russia have been re
ceived daily within the last ten days, and
Whereas, These outrages are still continuing and there is no
probability that they will be abated unless the civilized world takes
action to prevent the same, and ,
Whereas, These outrages of a brutal mob constitute an insult to
modem civilization, which affects the progress of the wprld at large, and
Whereas, The families of a great number of citizens of the United
States have been cast into mourning through the loss of their persecuted
relatives in Russia, be it
Resolved, That the residents of, San Francisco in mass J meeting
assembled, horrified by the outrages committed ; upon peaceful citizens,!
defenseless women^and .children,. express their,deepest sympathy^ with
the persecuted and distressed Jews in Russia.
Whereas, There is unmistakable evidence that these 'outbreaks
have occured and are still occurring with the encouragement and the
connivance of the bureaucracy of the Russian Government, therefore
be it further
Resolved, To request President Roosevelt in the name of the
people of the United States and in the name of humanity to call upon
the civilized governments to join with this Government in a demand
upon Russia for immediate measures enforcing law and order.

Representative Jewish citizens of San Francisco crowded Lyric Hall to the
doors last night in a mass meeting called, under the auspices of the. Jewish Free
Loan Society. They were gathered there to publicly express their feelings of
sorrow at. the terrible atrocities daily perpetrated upon their race -during the
present riots in Russia. They were there to &ive up to the cause of freedom a
part of their wealth and to send it across the ocean to their .' poverty-stricken
countrymen. " They were gathered there to denounce .the, action .. of , the Russian
Government In permitting such a bloody state of ' Internal" massacre to go on
without an effort being made to stop'lt by these in power." They were there to
ask the nations of the world to say to Russia: "Stop! You. have gone too far."
As a result of this great meeting of representative Jews a set of resolutions
was passed. These resolutions not only condemn the present lethargic policy of
Russia in quelling the' riots, but they ask President Roosevelt. to personally, bring
the terrible condition of the Russian Jews to the attention of the nations of the
world and to take some action to stay, the fearful hand of the unchecked mobs
who burn and slay and rape. A collection amounting to several hundred dollars
was prompted by tue Intense earnestness of those who were gathered: there'and
promises of future contributions were everywhere made. The resolutions will be
sent to the President. The money, with the- collections . that : have already been .
subscribed, will go to help the unfortunates of Russia. \u0084 -

Intense' feeling iwas the strength of this gathering. ' These; Jewish citizens
who met last night ehouted in no weak tones their approval of the words of the
speakers who urged the nations of the world to \u25a0 take 'ud the cause , of the suffer
ers in Russia. They contributed generously from ,\u25a0 their purses. Many said that
should ; it become necessary, they would carry a gun and go to the rescue of
their countrymen. They were confident, however, that the time for freedom was
at hand and that it would be gained through the interference of the great na
tions of the world. "The throne of the' Czar Is.no longer tottering; it has al
ready fallen. The reign of bureaucracy is at an end. The chosen-people will.be
freed." This was. the cry. of the speakers and it met with -the enthusiastic ap
proval of thÂ«, Jews assembled. , \u0084 -"
The mass meeting was presided .over by Jerome H. Kann.
"This meeting- has been called by the Hebrew Free> Loan Society," he said In hi*
op*nins remarks, "to rive -the Jewish citizens of this city", an opportunity.- to father:
and nod out what best they can do toward the relief of " our' unfortunate:' brothÂ«rs -in-
Russia. The exigencies of the occasion , did not allow any,, rreat. preparation. We â¢ arÂ»
gathered to show our brotherly feellnrs. We did not come here to protest alone, 1 but wÂ«'
are gathered to ; try, to r devise means; of/ Preventing further atrocities -on i \u25a0 the .'Jews', of
Russia. We are not here to shed tears â we are her*, to help!-^There lsnot cne- of us. who
would not clve hip life* blood in" fichtlnc \u25a0 for. cur " brothers rather \ than , see them mur-_

Roosevelt to take such steps a* he can to istop these outbreaks." . \u25a0

Congressman Julius. Kahn eloquently portrayed the horrors that ; are
belns: enacted daily In Russia. ,"The civilized world -stands appalled at the
terrible deeds which have ; been committed by the. fanatic mob* in; the "city
of Odessa." Continuing:, he said:

who profess the Jewish religion In Russia.. It .does not^seein- possible that : the .-twen

ST. PETERSBURG, J\'ov. 16. â¢. m.
A fierce northeast blizzard which blew
down on St. Petersburg to-night prevent
ed Jjloodshfcd Jn the Russian capita!. The
bitter cold, "by forcing: the strikers to re
xr.ain indoors, did aaore-.to preser^-e order
than a!i the Cossack cavalry patrolllns
the- -streets. He3\T.- military reserves are
stationed in all the industrial districts,
but; up to naidnight there was no rioting.
There. wt-ie rumors of collisions In differ
ent parts of the city, but on Investigation
Lhey turned out to be -false.
The Social Democrats had an impressive
response on the part of all organizations
of workmen to their summons for- a gen
eral political strike to 'demonstrate their
solidarity wjth the struggle of their Pol
ish fomrades for autonomy and to protest
against the execution of the mutinous
sailors at Kroastadt. The men walked
out of all the big mills and factories
and the employes of the Baltic and War
saw railroads, the printers and other
c!arsÂ»es of laborers struck/ but the shops
in the center of the city-wer^ not closed.
Troopa took charge of the electric light
Et&tlons, which .were operated by sailors,
so 'that the city was not In darkness to
night.
DISSENSION AMONG LEADERS.
No dispatches have arrlvrd from the In
terior/ However, to show that the work
men In other cities have responded to the
demand for co-operation, ar.d' dissension
has broken out among the leader?,' pome
vf whom believe the strike" to be hasty
and ill-ad\*iscd, and who say that if it
does not succeed the result will be loss
of prestige. At. meetings- to-night this
faction urged the loaders to announce to
morrow that the strike was intended 'only
as a demonstration, but the radicals,
v hose aim is to k*>ep up the revolutionary
agitation at all hazards, refused to listen
to -such counsels. They insisted that it
was vitally necessary for the success of
th.t-.ir propaganda' among the army and
the navy that: they should gp^ credit for
taking the lives of the mutineers, and that
If thÂ«>y could force the Government to re
c*<ie from its position regarding Poland
they would have it j by " the throat.
At strike headquarters to-night reports
were being received and the leaders re
fused to admit that the question of aban
doning the strike had yet been raised. . .
The situation hsfs caused a renewal
of the panicky feeling- among the In
habitants, whose nerves were already
shattered by the events, of the last
fortnight, and hundreds of persons who
hid just returned are again leaving
for Finland. The foreign residents are
becoming more and more alarmed and
many of them are hastily preparing to
go abroad for the winter.
In case the Finnish Socialists should
join their Russian comrades and tie up
the Finnish railroad, the only egress
wouid be by water and the freezing
of the Gulf of Finland a fortnight
hence would close the last exit. The
foreign embassies share the public
alarm, and the British embassy is ad
vising the Immediate removal of wo
men and children. .
POWERS XOT TO INTERFERE.
All sorts of wild rumors about in
ttaference by the foreign powers are
In circulation and the Bourse Gazette
prints a report that all the great pow
ers have Joined in a notiQcaUon to
liussia that they intend to interfere
and prevent anarchy. This is as false
as the story circulated that Mr. Eddy,
the American Charge dAffaires, has
â¢telegraphed for a warship. The Amer
ican embassy has not asked for a war
ship and has not been advised by the
State Department that one Is coming.
Count de Wltte and his Cabinet were
in session throughout the afternoon
and evening discussing, the situation
end a number of prominent Liberals
xrere called in for consultation. Grand
Duke Nicholas was present part of the
time. The possibility that the Gov
ernment might be compelled, if the
situation grew worse, to declare mar
t!al law in St. Petersburg, was con
sidered, but ag far as has been learned
no deflnite decision in this matter was
reached.
ICMPEIUTK COUNCIL REJECTED.
\u25a0 While the league of Leagues is disposed
to back up the strike, the workmen are
undoubtedly alienating much public sym
pathy by their recklessness. Many Lib
erate ooenly declare that thÂ« strike in a
tactical blunder wlilch may prove disas
trous, but their temperate counsel is re
jected.
Jn Government circles It U recognized
that tlw situation In Poland requires a
skinful hand at the heim. Governor Gen
eral Scalon probably will be replaced by
a, man oT Count de Witte's choice. The
name of General Mensky is mentioned In
this connection, but It is doubtful if he
v-111 accept the office under present con
ditions. - - " .
. In response to Inquiries Count de Witte
1? said to have reiterated his assurances
that the Jewish question will be referred

DEMUEKERt OVERRULED
Ka nsan Leaviiig ;No Stone
Unturned in His Endeavor
to Escape a Convictipri
ST. LOUIS, Nov.. 16.â United States
Circuit Judge t Vandevanter to-day
overruled the demurrer filed yester
day* to the 'indictment of United
States Senator Burton-of Kansas. 1
'. The trial of Senator- Burton on the
charge of having used his influence be
fore the Postoffice Department'in'/be
half of ; the": Rial to Grain and Securities
Company .of St. Louis to prevent: the
issuance of a fraud, order against the
company, ,1s set; for next Monday.
R The* demurrer.:,, overruled by Judge
Vandevanter.'.was based " on ..two counts
fn r the^ indictment and set forth the
contention that the charge that Senator
Burton .'had received compensation for
services : from -a concern against which
charges > were 7 pending ."was 'â¢' vague . ;in
that it-, did: hot 'specify, the exact na
ture of 'the proceedings said : . to be
pending. "The second, objection raised
in the \u25a0 demurrer was j that It was ;, not
specifically stated in the indictment
that .Senator Burton. knew of the. pro
ceedings-against", the-company by the
Postofllce Department when, -it was al
leged,'he-received compensation.
As tor the first objection in the de
murrer' Judge Vandevanter said: \u0084 :,
It seems to me that the fact ' charged , was
that a proceeding : was ' pending. I*hi3 iamÂ«
point was : raised on - the pre vlou* Indictment
*ndÂ»lnce then I have made a very, doss study
of this feature of the case, and. It seems to me
that ( the proceeding ! 1Â« ' sufficiently . described
In the Indictment.-. It Is Immaterial how-, that
proceeding came to be pending. It Is material
only that - a proceeding was J pending. : I
: As / to " the second objection, Judge
Vandevante/said: â¢> i
I am strongly persuaded that onÂ« could not
receive conipengatlon under these circumstances
without' knowing- '* that \u25a0proe'eedlnss were under
way or were v about to be begun. ..As to thÂ«
indictment In this case, I am of the opinion
that the District Attorney could not -well have
prepared an indictment more. in accord With the
requirements: of -.the statute.
Attorneys ' representing-'. Senator. Bur
ton; this afternoon filed; a plea in bar
to prosecution under this indictment.
This plea is based on /the verdict in
the .trial of Senator .Burton almost two
years ago, which, found him grullty on
certain charges in the Indictment and
not guilty on; other charges. He was
found not guilty of having- received
compensation from an officer of the Rialto
Company. Thfc; plea ins bar sets' forth
that, having previously '\u25a0 been acquitted
on Â«this specific charge, he^ cannot ; a
second time be placed in jeopardy for
the same offense. Arguments "will be
heard -before Judge Vandavanter ;to
raorrow morning.' i,;;-;- \u0084 r : >

JUGGLED WITH TRUTH.
E. H. Harriiiian. testifying yesterday before the Xew York legislative committee
investigating insurance scandals, flatly denied a number of sensational statements
made by James H. Hyde. The latter was recalled to > 'the stiuid and reiterated his
charges against liarriman. /
Question of Verac
ity Between Two
Witnesses.
Odell to Be Sworn
in the Insurance
Investigation.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.â E.;H. Harriman,
chairman of the board of directors of the
Union Pacific Railroad, former member of
the board of directors of the Equitable
Life Assurance Society, and connected
with many railroads and financial insti
tutions, the former friend of James Ha
*en Hyde, against whom the latter
charged acts of an unfriendly nature in
his testimony yesterday, was one of the
chief witnesses before the Armstrong
committee on insurance Investigation to
day.
Harriman was called immediately after
recess, and his testimony was a series of
denials. of the charges made by Hyde.
Harriman said that Hyde came to him
about a. month before . the Odell settle
ment was made and asked him to use his
Influence to induce Governor Odell to set
tle his suit against the Mercantile Trust
Company. Hyde told him that the Odell
euit was dangerous to the Mercantile
Trust Company, In that it might Induce
other suits to-be brought by other persons
\u25a0who had subscribed- to the bonds of the
United States Shipbuilding Company.
Harriman said he arranged an inter
view between Governor Odell and
Hyde, which was held in Harriman's
office. Governor Odell seemed to be
Irritated after the interview.
71 A II KIM AX AS GO-BET\VEE.\.
Some days later Hyde and Colby visited
Harriman and Harrlman promised to see
Governor Odell and "try to get him to do
something about settling the suit." An
other interview between Governor Odell
and Hyde took place: It may have been
at Harritr.an's house. Afterward Hyde
told Harriman that he was willing to pay
JTO.OOO and asked Mm to. try to get the
Governor to accept that amount. Gov
err>cr Oden told Harriman that If he
(Karriman) advised it, he (Odell) would
settle for that amount.
"I saw Mr. Hyde after that interview,"
eaid Harriman, "and said to him that if
I were in hJs place and were negotiating
to settle with Governor Odell I would not
stard on *7SJJOO on a settlement of that
kind. I would make it satisfactory. I
understood that Mr. Hyde saw him and
payment w.-is made, of which I had no
further knowledge."
In reply to inquiries by Hughes, Harri
man said Odell did not tell him that a
bill had betn introduced in the Legisla
ture to repeal the charter of the Mercan
tile Trust-Company; ana that' his first In
timation of this came from his counsel
to-<iay.
"Did you say anything to Hyde In any
of these interviews as to the desirability
of settling the suit because of the power
that might be exercised against the com
pany at Albany?" asked Hughes.
"No, sir."
"Did you make any mention to Mr.
Hyde of any attempts that had been
or might be made to repeal the charter
of the Mercantile Trust Company?"
"No, sir.*'
HYIJI2 WANTS AMBASSADORSHIP.
Harriznan said that he made no refer
ence to the advantage of a settlement In
order to avoid an attack upon the com
pany, and vhat Governor Odell did not re
quest him to use his influence to obtain
a settlement of the claim. Governor
Odell, Harrlman said, had no Interview
with him to bring about a settlement, but
the request came exclusively from Hyde.
A portion of Hyde's testimony. In which
he said Harrlman had suggested to him
that an effort might be made to repeal
the charter of the Mercantile Trust Com
pany, was then read to Harrlman, who
eaid that. he did not make such a sugges
tion to Hyde.

There is another kind of steam than

This, other kind of steam is human

Some people call this human "steam"

I RAILROAD MAX WHO. TESTIFYING AT THE INSURANCE INQUIRY. DIRECTLY V
CONTRADICTED STATEMENTS MADE CXDER OATH .BY THE FORMER
VICE PRESIDENT OF. THE EQUITY BLE SOCIETY. .1 . \u0084 \u0084
Harriman /also denied having said to
Hyde, as Hyde had testified, that there
was a possibility of powerful interests at
Albany doing harm to the Mercantile
Trust Company because, of the shipbuild-
ing loss. He also denied having said any
thing to Hyde about the repeal of the
charter of the Mercantile Trust Com
pany, and declared that he did not know
of any rumor that a bill was Introduced
to . repeal that charter.
About a year ago," Harrlman said, Hyde
came to him and asked him to use his
influence to have him appointed as Em
bassador to France, and that he (Harri
man) promised when he saw the Presi
dent to speak to him about it. Harriman
said that he did so, but did not recom
mend Hyde's appointment.
MENTIONED IT TO ROOSEVELT.
Harriman said he did not know whether
Governor Odell did anything about the
appointment. There was no connection,
Harriman said, between Governor ' Odell' s
claim and nls own action on the Embas
sadorship.
Harriman said he mentioned the sub
ject of the Odell suit to President Roose
velt, but did not remember "whether the
President was consulted about It.
Harriman said that early in the Equit
able troubles he had defended Hyde from
the attacks upon him, but had advised
him to favor the adoption of the Frick
report, and had told him that if he would
he (Harriman) would stand by Hyde
through thick and thin. He also advised
Hyde, he said, to state that the methods
he had pursued were in use when he .went
intb'the society, "and \ that he . was young
and inexperienced; that he was sorry and;
hoped to retrieve, himself if he were,
given an opportunity/ Hyde, the witness
said, objected to doing that.
Harrlman said he might have told Hyde
that It would be a good thing to have
such a committee appointed as the one
headed by Frick. He declared that he
had had never said that the report of the
Frick committee would be favorable to
Hyde and that he was not concerned in
any offer to buy the Hyde stock, and had
told Hyde , and Frick that Hyde ought
not to sell it.
OFFERED TO HELP HYDE.
!â¢ On the day. before the report of the
â¢ Frick committee \ was presented, Harri-
I man said, he _ told Hyde that he did not
j think anybody but the Equitable Society
I or Hyde . should own : the Hyde shares *of
t Equitable stock, and that if Hyde had
any fears on that subject! he (Harriman)
would subscribe $500,000 to a fund to help
him hold It, that if he thought it- de
sirable to turn It over to the Equitable
I without any pay for it. Harriman thought
(others could be Induced to do the same
j thing.
i Harriman did not recall that Hyde
J made " any .answer to that suggestion^
{ Harrlman did . not : repeat this talk to the
j Frick committee, and he said; he; did not
j think that committee had any. specific ln-
I formation about the relations / of ; j the
' Equitable to the Union Pacific "preferred I
1 stock syndicate other . than ; the charges J
j made to the committee by "James >W.'|
, Alexander. The, committee did \u25a0 not. ask
him about the facts. In ', the findings of I
the Frick committee, Harrlman 'said, he]
understood that Hyde's membership iin
â¢the syndicate : was' criticized on", the ; score .
that he had committed the Equitable Sd-^j.
cle*y to transactions -without the knowl- j
edge of the executive committee. !
"Do you, knoWi whether or not Governor;
Odell wrote a letter"wither/to.the-Presi
dent or to the Secretary of State, advocat- j

should be written by Governor Odell If
the suit were settled.
Harriman said he had told Hyde, when
he asked him to become a director of the
Equitable, that he (Harriman) ; did not
think the method of the management of
the society was the right. one, and that
Hyde had said _ that .he intended' to
change it. â¢ â¢ â¢ . *
Harriman suggested that James J. Hill
be made a director of the society.
, Describing his duties as a director, Har
rlman >aid he attended the quarterly
meetings and heard the statements of
the officers, in which they extolled the
conduct'of the officers and congratulated
them on the â¢ prosperity of the society.
He had nothing directly to do with the
management of the Equitable. He never
looked Into the expenses of .""the society
until he became a member of the Frick
committee.,' ...-.,;.
Harriman said he did notvhave any in
terview with either S Hyde ; or Governor
Odell about the settlement of the Odell
claim prior to the adjournment ; of the
Legislature in 1904.' Asked what^ he said
to President Roosevelt about the French
Embassadorship, Harriman said: ..^
"I. simply .told him that I had been re
quested lo suggest to him the ' appoint
ment of . Mr. Hyde, . and that- Mr. ;r Hyde
was located \in Paris, and, as ': I \ under
stood, had a good position there;, and " I
had done what I had- been requested to
do." ; " ; ; - ' ; ;;. ;:
H YDE HOLDS .TO HIS VERSION.
.Hyde was asraln recalled after Harri
man and denied that he .'suggested, the
settlement of the Odell : suit | as : testified

MOKE MEN NEEDED
FOE COAST DEFENSE
Eecommendations Made by
General Mills, Chief'
of Artillery.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15â General Sam
uel M. Mills, chief of artillery, says that
for manning the coast defenses of the
United States â¢ a force consisting of 1744
officers and 41,833 enlisted men is needed,
while the corps \u25a0 has at : present j only 525
officers and 13.744 men. He estimates that
the cost of the installation of fire control
equipment â¢ for .coast' artillery \u25a0 will be
$7,000,000. Following the advice contained
In, a letter of President Roosevelt to the
Secretary of. War "dated March 13. 1905,
In | which the President designated nine
specific* subjects j relative to the jengaglng
and training: of the artillery arm of the
service, the . annual report of General
Mills makes the following nine recom
mendations: . * â¢" i-
The separation of the coast and field artil
lery;- provision for . submarine mine . defense;
an Increase for coast artillery for Bun defence;
the organization >of the coast artillery; ade
quate pay, for technically skilled enlisted men
of the coast artillery; an Increase of the field
artillery: the proper organization of the field
artillery; examination for promotion :of artil
lery officers of all craties : increased plans for
target practice by both , branches of the artil
lery. v v. â¢ _
General Mills says that of the 126 com
panies of coast artillery. < 47 , are without
captains and 41 without the prescribed
two '\u25a0: lieutenants. ; These officers are ab
sent on . various duties. He " says that it
Is important that the coast artillery com
panies should be commanded by captains.

Nevada Board of Pardons Re
fuses to Interfere in Be
half of Four Murderers
Epeclal P.tpatch to Tha Call.
RENO*. Nev.. Nov. 15.â After being in
session all day the Board of Pardons to
night refused to Interfere in behalf o*
Sevener, Gorman, Robert and Williams,
who are sentenced to be hanged Friday
afternoon at the State Prison ' at Carson
for the murder of Jack Welch three
years ago. - Great pressure was brought
to bear on the beard to recommend a
commutation of the sentence to life im
prisonment. The attorneys who prose
cuted the case, several of the Jurymen
who convicted the prisoners, ministers
of the : Gospel, and prominent attorneys
and business men made pleas in behalf
of the condemned, but to no avail.
. The board then announced its decision
not to interfere. The vote of the board
stood three to two. There is still a pos
sibility that the Governor may grant
the men a stay of execution, but the pos
sibility is very remote.
The two sisters of Gorman arrived in
Carson from San Francisco several days
ago and made a pathetic appeal to the
board for 'the life of their brother. They
arrived in Reno to-night from. Carson
heartbroken and despondent, but ' still
firm in the belief of their brother's In
nocence.

My Dear Dr. Roberts: I have your letter of

call of your dtlf-gaticn upon me and our talk
upon the j-iroiostU meeting of the interchurch
conference of federation. I have the very high
est eyaijjathy with the movement; for in
stance. I feel that Indirectly, in addition to
the good it will do here, tt is iwerfectly possi
ble that the movement may have a very con
siderable effect in the Christianizing- of Japan,
which I feel to be retcjirea by the divisions
among ourselves and by the failure to recog
nize t!'e fact that tne Christian church in
Japan must of course assume essentially a
Japanese national form.
So you see I hare a very -real interest In
vrhat you are doinz and or.ly wish it were in
my power tÂ» ancnS the Â«iecting, as you re
quest, but 1 regret to Â«ay thai it is out of the
question for tne to do so. lam genuinely sorry
to have to write ycu thus.

WASHINGTON. , Nov. \u25a0 15.â That - there vis
to be a serious attempt to reorganize the
Republican party in New York City and
take its control from ex-Governor Odell
was disclosed here to-day when Senator
Thomas C. ,P!att. OdeWs opponent 1 for
the leadership of the party in the State,
and William Barnes Jr. of Albany; chair

Republicans .are as badly . frightened up
the State as they are in .New York; City,
and are now, convinced that if Ire volution
ary methods in organization and in legis
lation be not. adopted the, State govern
ment will -be as surely Democratic after
the next election as Pennsylvania alter
the. election of ,last week.': . , .
â¢Prominent Republicans from; all dis
tricts of the State have been bombarding
President Roosevelt _ with; requests that
he do something to aid in the reorganiza
tion of the party. They have been telling
him that only a complete change in man
agement and aspirations can place the
party in a position where \ it , can have
even a fighting chance of being success
ful at the polls. : They "assure him the
party must be cut from its graft associa
tion entirely and there must be a new
deal all around, or every branch of the
State government will pass into the hands
of the Democratic party. , " V
President Roosevelt is convinced that
there must be. a reorganization of the
New York county committee,. but he is
somewhat puzzled as to what use he shall
make of the only material available for
a flKht against Chairman Odell. He has,
of course, the actlvo co-operation "of Sen
ator Platti and so far as Senator Piatt
can aid the ' President 'he is willinc to
do so. but in a fsght-fera new deal all
around Senator PlattV power to contrib-'

street stores, beaten, kicked and bruised

from wrongdoing, driven from her home,
half-clad, by her valiant spouse, brand

day.
Drags<Â»d from the wife's lips were the
trartling charges against the man whom

criminals.
Despite her long story of atmse an<l ne

Mrs. Helms not only with greatest re
luctance, but against her own attorneys

his wife's testimony that he had been
connected with any scheme of robbery,
such as she indicated. He declared that
the only basis for her charges was the
fact that his name had been Â» unfairly
linked with those of men who had lost
their Mars. He Insisted that no investi
gation wag ever conducted by his depart
ment superiors, and that no charges had
Â«"ver been lodged against him with the
Police Commissioners.
The P '.Ice Commissioners took cogni
zance of the case last night, however,

Chief Dinan to prefer charges against the
policeman, based on the accusations
made by the wife.
TBIXS STOBY OF CRUELTY.
Mrs. Helms, as the prhscipal witness
In the trial of her i=uit yesterday, re
cited a Jong story of abuse and cruelty
\u25a0which led up to the query from Attorney
Connolly, her counsel:
"You stated that when you resided on
Gucrrrro street your husband beat and
kicked you?" â¢ '
"Yes, he bruised me and : gave me. a
beating twice." '.".V
"On different days?"
"How did it happen the first day?"
"He "was going to do something wrong 1
and I begged him not to do those things, |
tnd bf abused me."
"What were those bad things?" In
quired the attorney.
"I, don't want to tell," declared Mrs.
Helms. "I might get my husband into
trouble with other people." . â¢ '-: ;r-.-.,
Attorney Connolly, respecting his
client's desire*, did not press the inquiry
further, but Attorney Breen for Helms
interposed:
"We would like to have that question
enswertd," he said. â¢
"I don't want to get that man out of
his; Job." Insisted Mrs. Helms.
"I wanted him to do right." she con-;
tinu'ed. "And if I have to tell these
things I 'shall: have to bring other wit-:
nc-ssÂ«s to prove them I would rather
keep this <>'!t." S . .
â¢â¢tvcii," Connolly continued, not pleased
wittj the situation, "you might state gen- j
c rally what caused the trouble."
WAS TO COMMIT THEFT.
"It was because "he was going to
steal." the harassed woman, blurted
out.
"Going to steal?" interjected Judge
Graham. "Going to steal what?"
"He a-nd other police officers were go
ing to steal from a store down on Mar
ket street." declared Mrs. Helms. "
"And he told me." she added with
much display of fee-ling, "ths.t if I ever
told these things that he had done since
he was en the police force he ..would
lull .me; and I don't .want himy to
kill me." \u25a0 ':â¢_/'\u25a0\u25a0,'- %â¢ '

LIBRARIES MAY COMBINE.
Trustees to Discuss Merging
MEMBERS OF THE MECHANICS' INSTITUTE -AND OF THE MERCANTILE LI
BRARY. WHO HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN URGING AND PERFECTING THE
PLANS FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE TWO LIBRARIES.
The members of the Mercantile Li
brary will gather in the meeting-room
to-r.ight at 223 Satter street to consider
the proposition of merging the library
v.ith that of the Mechanics' Institute.
For some time the proposition has been
agitated, n.nd the almost general senti
ment of the members favors aiTiliation
with the Mechanics' Institute Library.
The idea of merging ha.6 been well re
ceived by the trustees of the Mechanics'
Institute, and inducements are being
held out for affiliation. It Is planned
that the combined libraries be known
as thÂ« Mecha nlcs'-Mercantlle Library.
For some years the Mercantile Li
brary has been unfortunate in the con
duct of its affairs, and each year has
been losing considerable jnoney. After
the building on Van Ness avenue was
vacated and sold the amount in the
hands of the directors was in the neigh
borhood of $40,000. For the last four
years, however, the library has been
running behind, owing to the lack of
xnembership, and it is estimated that
the '.ops each year has been somewhere
near $5000.
The Question that has of late been
agitated by the trustees is whether thÂ«j
library shall continue to do business
and keep running: until the funds arc
exhausted or whether It shall combine
â¢with another library. In the considera
tion of this Question the trustees came
In contact with representatives of the
Public library and of the Mechanics'
Library, who made offers of consolida
tion.
The offer made by the Public Library
was, in substance, that the Public Li
brary would take over the books of the
present Mercantile Library and th<a
sum of money on hand for a Mercantile
branch of the Free Public Library, to
be established near Golden Gate Park.
By the adoption of this plan, however,
the collection of the Mercantile Library
vouJd no lonper remain Intact; the
Important books would go to fill va
cancies on the shelves of the main li
brary, while only a part of the collec
tion, together with new books, would
make up the Mercantile brancYi.
SUBSTANTIAL OFFER.
The offer of the Mechanics' Library
trustees was however, a more sub
stantial one. The board offered to take
over the collection of the Mercantile
Library, keeping- It intact, and. In ad
dition, givlnjr the Mercantile Library a
part of the title of the affiliated li
braries.
Moreover, br the affiliation, the Me
chanics* Library, coming Into posses
sion of the sum already on hand in| the
Mercantile treasury, offers to give the
COO members of the Mercantile Library
the standing of life members in the
Mechanics' Mercantile Library, the, reg
ular fee being $CO. This would give' the
present members of the Mercantile Li
brary a much greater advantage than

they would .possess if the Public Li
brary takes over the Mercantile, for the
members will have no more privileges
in the Public Library Uhan will any
other borrower. from that library.
In the Public Library the Mercantile
collection would be swallowed up and
lost, but in joining with the Mechanics' the
valuable collection of technical works
would remain Intact and very little dupli
cation would result, as the Mechanics'
and Mercantile libraries have developed
along different lines.
The Mechanics'. Institute, with Its
$1,500,000 worth of property, is well able
to care for and enlarge the collection and
Is ready to merge. At one .time it was
planned by the trustees of the Mercantile
Library to secure an endowment by pop
ular subscription in, the hope that $250,000
would be raised so that the interest would
run the library. The subscription plan
was recognized as a hazardous undertak
ing. Another plan was the securing of
more members, but that was also found
impossible, and unless a move Is made
toward affiliation, ; the library will run
only as long as the fund on hand holds
out.
URGE CO.VSOLIDATIOX.
Some time ago a representative of the
Mechanics' Library was employed by the
Mercantile Library to look over the field
and suggest .the proper course for con
solidation. This representative, after be
ing placed in a lucrative position, found
that his chances of retaining the position
would be lost if the consolidation took
place, and has opposed the affiliation of
the libraries. In doing so he has influ
enced members of the Mercantile Library
and the Mechanics'. Library against the
merging, and it is to dissipate this preju
dice and yj discuss ' the benefits of the
change that the meeting to-night will be
held.
The prominent members of the Mercan
tile Library are In_favo"r of the corisoli :
datlon with the Mechanics' Institute Li
brary. The trustees of the Mechanics'
Institute are unanimous on the question
and the opposition of a few members is
based on the mistaken idea that the indi
viduality of the Mechinlcs'; Institute will
be lost. The Mechanics' Institute is a
corporation formed to conduct , libraries,
lecture courses and even schools, so long
as those ventures ; are profitable. The
joining of the Mechanics'" Library, with
the Mercantile would In- no way affect
the status or existence of the Institute.
Prominent among the officials in favor*
of the consolidation are C. K. Bonestel
and Colonel D. E. Miles of the Mercan
tile Library, President R. J. Taussig sof
the Mechanics' Library, and Livingston
Jenks, chairman of its consolidation, com
mittee. The last; two named ; have been
particularly active in agitating consolida
tion. Both are members l of " the two li
braries and are of * the firm opinion that
consolidation with the Mechanics' Library
is the best course to pursue. "V

last,., and the.;parlshloners_have delayed
starting the work of rebuilding pending
the decision of .the Pope. .
| Now. the modest little edifice will be re
placed by, a splendid cathedral, which the
Catholics of Nevada said they desired to
build to house their bishop. If one was
given them..: _
The process of the selection of a bishop
for the new diocese of Nevada will take
at least a. year, and the recommendations
will .emanate, "from Sacramento. \u25a0 The
names jof three candidates will be sent
from here to- Rome, and from them the
Pope_will_make his selection. He will
communicate" his" choice to" the Apostolic
Delegate at Washington, who will in turn
notify the new bishop of his appointment.
The State of Nevada, with the exception
of a smallpart in the Bait, Lake diocese,
has always been included In the Sacra
mento diocese, and the separation . of
Nevada into | an independent diocese, of
the. Catholic church, with a. bishop. of Its
own. marks an important development In
the affairs of the Catholic church in the
West. \u25a0 ' â¢ .

Volume of Heated Atmosphere.
Attorney Krouse was before Justice
McFarland of -the Supreme Court yes
terday with a full line of argument In
explanation of. his claim that he should
not. be compelled to : satisfy -Judge Gra
ham's judgment for contempt. The de
fendant's remarks. were soporific to the
last ; : degree and were emphasized by
endless repetition. * .
Krouse blushingly. confessed' that he
was not accustomed to handle so
weighty legal matters and asked for a
postponement, until "his counsel"
could be present. It - developed that
"his counsel" was Attorney Newburgh.
Justice McFarland declined to order a
postponement and after hearing both
sides declared -that he would render
a decision in a day .or .two. â¢ ... t
The. defendant was directed' to pay
$100 or spend five days in the County
Jail for using contemptuous language
in Judge Graham's court.' He spent
one night in~ custody- and has , been
fighting, ever since to escape the rest
of his punishment.

returned and loaded a car with what he
was careful . to make certain was rai
sins. This car was shipped, and two

THE LAW IN CHICAGO.
A PETITION has been sent to the Mayor of Chicago, asking
him to enforce the law which orders saloons to be closed on
Sunday. There are wide differences of opinion regarding
what are called "Sunday laws." One day's rest in- seven was* -the
rule of races and of nations at the dawn of history, and no doubt
it was in force in the long, far and dim ages beyond: The day of
rest naturally became the day of religious ceremony and observance.
As such the' Assyrians kept it. The Egyptians took it 'from the As
syrians, and it "became the common inheritance of all the . races
which peopled the territory of the first empires. Christianity took
it from the Jews and clothed it with more religious authority.
It is recognized by philosophers as among th^e physical neces
sities of man that he rest from his labors one day in the week. But
there is a lasting discussion as to how far law shall go in dictating
the method of keeping the day of rest. The day itself varies with
different forms of the religious idea. The Mohammedan keeps Friday,
the Jews and some sects of Christians observe Saturday, and others
set aside Sunday as the day. In this country it is regarded as an
invasion of personal liberty to make one man keep another man's
day after he has observed his own. In Tennessee members of the
Christian sect known as "Seventh Day Adventists," a most reputable
class of citizens, are imprisoned for working on Sunday, after having
kept Saturday as their own day of rest and religious observance.
The law of this State exposed them to the same risk, but our Sunday
laws were referred to the people in the election of 1882 and were
repealed.
The effect upon the morals of the State has not been observed
as harmful, but there are certain lines of business, under control
of the police powers of a State, that are regarded as harmful, though
licensed. The liquor saloon, being one of them, is marked out for
special restriction by law. The law says that the saloons of Chicago
shall be closed on Sunday. It is not worth while to discuss the wis-
dom or benefit of this law. It is sufficient that it is the law, and all
public officers who take oath to faithfully enforce the law are
obligated to enforce this Sunday closing statute. Mayor Dunne
took that oath, but Chicago is a wide open town on Sunday. When
he received the petition asking him to keep his oath and close the
saloons on Sunday he made this reply: "In the last campaign Mr.
Harlan and I stated our position on the question. We were both in
favor of the saloons being open on Sunday. He got 137,000 votes
and I received 162,000. Stewart, the Prohibition candidate, was in
favor of closing the bars on Sunday. He got 3000, votes. .That
ought to give a pretty good idea of public sentiment on the ques
tion/ . -
The Chicago saloons will stay open on Sunday, and the law will
be disregarded. But Mayor Dunne was not elected because he prom
ised to disregard his oath and disobey the law. His election was
due to other issues. He and Harlan were both demagogues, who
thought that votes might be gained by making a vicious and im
moral promise to nullify the law. It happened that the saloons
controlled votes and so this demoralizing pledge was made to them
to gain the votes they influenced. But if another and more harmful
class controlled as many votes, the same pledge would have been
made to it.
If the law closing the saloons on Sunday is a bad law repeal
it, but while it is. the law it should be enforced. If it be bad its
rigid enforcement will the' quickest insure its repeal. The violation
of law in this country is too much winked at and let pass as of no
consequence. If the' law protect the humblest or most unpopular
man he should have its benefit. We permit Chinese and Japanese to
be despoiled and chased out of localities where the supreme law of
the land says they may be, and yet we are fired with indignation
when the Chinese in China retaliate on Americans or other for
eigners.
Chicago is the second city in the Union. The country is judged
by what is done in its great cities. Anarchy opposes all law, disobeys
ail law, and would overthrow all law. Mayor Dunne refuses to
enforce one law, though sworn to do it. He is to that extent an
anarchist. When one law is flouted, all laws are weakened. The
American way is to repeal a law, as we repealed the Sunday law in
California, when it is obnoxious to public sentiment. The right of
repeal is deposited exclusively with the legislative representatives of
the people. It is not by direct vote, nor by rndirect vote cast for a
candidate who promises to ignore the law, as Dunne and Harlan did.
Let Chicago right herself by repealing the law. If the representa
tives of the people want instruction, let the question be referred to
popular vote at a special election, uncomplicated with any other
issue, and then repeal or affirm the law, in a proper and legal manner.
Any other course is anarchy. \u25a0__/,
THE RIGHT TO ASPIRE.
A SPEAKER, addressing a meeting of clergymen in this city
recently, said: "I consider that the mechanic should have
the right to aspire to being a public servant as well as the
men in the professions."
"Should have" is used as if the mechanic or workingman had
not that right now. It is a common right. One of our California
Representatives in Congress was a painter. His right to aspirp and
his quality and fitness seated him among the national lawmakers.
Senator Perkins was a sailor. His right to aspire made; him State
Legislator, Governor and United States Senator. President Johnson
was a tailor and could neither read nor write until after he was 21.
\u25a0Stephen A. Douglas was a cabinetmaker. Senator McDonald of
Indiana was a harnessmaker. Senator Dodge of lowa was a lead
miner. Senator Sawyer of Wisconsin Was a lumberjack. Broderick
of California was a stonecutter. General, Governor and Senator Pal
mer of Illinois was a cooper. So the cases run into numbers of men
who aspired while mechanics and^wbrkingmen, and when they
reached public service they left a permanent impression upon the
history of the country^ -
But when they aspired they* began to qualify themselves for
that toward which they aspired. That is the secret. It is the rule
in this country that the aspiring man who while working with his
hands trains his head has the sympathy and the support of the
American people. It is quite another thing to aspire without qualifi
cation and fitness. " Such an aspirant, when his ambitions fail; usu
ally accuses his fellow citizens of rejecting him because he is a work
ingman, and this accusation is false. Free institutions can exist
only when every man with the legal qualifications may aspire to
enter the public service. Free institutions will perish when class
solidarity indorses aspiration without fitness or qualification.
An unworthy discontent is promoted by^making it appear that the
right of aspiration is denied to any in this country. It is far better
to teach, preach and exhort that ambition shall equip and fitQtself
for the higher duty that attracts it. .

rectors and pronounced all right. Mr. McCall felt sure that he would be

widely in their views as to the tax values
of certain of his property, notably. his art
treasures, upon which he has lavished
a fortune. At one time there occurred a
spirited clash over these articles, but the
appraisers, moved by.. Mr. Field's great
public benefactions and generally cheer
ful disposition to bear his part of the
public burdens, yielded to , his j contention
that his art treasures, while costing :i
large sum, in reality possessed little as

IX-NOCENT. LITTLE BOY'S DIABY.

fond mqther said she ; feared be would
die young and go to heaven, becausÂ© he
was so preternaturally good; but his
father and the neighbors all kept silence
when the fond mother said It)
August cteenthâ Ma cal.ed me this morn

with cramivs in my stomach.
B :XJâ Cramps much worse. Ma said shÂ«

"Oh. rats!" Fathers never have enoUgh
confidence in their sons.
8:35 â Ma -crying. Fa say*," "Oh. well!
Let him stay home from school then!".- If
it wasn't for mothers boys ; would have
no true friend.
B:sSâ Cramps some better, but still too
serious to' permit going to school. ' "
. s:llâ Cramps have disappeared. " Just
happened to think that swimming's good
now. Pa's gone to the office, and I'll
wait till ma's looking the other way.""

him that he saw me in swimming to-day.
I told him the man was mistaken. Pa
didn't believe me. Fathers never have

After Listening to
a Debate.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
'â¢Resolved. That the iafluence. of- a,.
woman's club upon her home Is bene- \u25a0
tcial."
To every sood cJuli'woma.n this is of
course an obvious thing, and every club
womanâ who is assumed to be intelligent,
fca.vins had brains enough to become
oneâ hutes to handle the obvious.
But there are some women outside cf
clubs, and men of the Cleveland-Clam
pett type who stand in need of light.
So the Forum Club set out yesterday
to thrash out the matter in a six-hun
dred debateâ Mrs. J. Homer Fritch, leader
lor the affirmatives, assisted by Mrs. L.
B. Ellen and Mrs. A. Sinclair. -lined up
against Mrs. F. H. Abbott, leader for the
negative, supported by Mrs. Tirey L. Ford
end Miss Blanche Tisdale.
The debate took place behind closed
ioors in the "coznfy" clubrooms on Sut
ter street. Mrs. Frances M. Wright
At 2:30 the debate was called.
Seven true and tried Forum women had
gathered to hear what argument the op
position could possibly dig up to sup
port its side. And these clubwomen know
argument, too, when they hear it. Asser
tion might have deluded their grandmoth
ers, but never a twentieth century club
"woman. wlib wants to be shown.
It was passed up to the club to decide
by ballot xrhich side presented the best
argumentâ prejudice, friendship and pre
conceived opinions to be barred.
From the first the affirmative had the
best cf itâ abetted by encouraging nods
ax.d becks and wreathed smiles "from, the
bleachere."
As for the negative, they put up a
plucky f.ght, Mrs. Tirey L. Ford almost
scoring a touchdown. Good team work,
however, defeated her brilliant play*,
erd the decision was given to the al-
Cnnatives. the score standing 63 to 13.
A pity 'tis that Dr. Clampettâ who has
always been considered rather a good fel
low among' clubwomen, and who now
think him only misguided or bilious â did
Cot hear the arguments.
Herewith ere a few: "Clubs are pow
erful aids to women's healthâ the cor
nerstone of a liaypy home. Physicians
arÂ« recommendlne the activities and rec
reations of clubs, as an antidote for
â¢nerves' and it works admirably. That
monotony, the poison that elowly slay?
- coaiesUc happiness. Is broken by the in
terests cf clubdom was made plain; that
prejudice, narrowness of vision, intol
ertLcce and Ignorance are combated in
tliÂ« clubs and to a great degree over
come, thereby making: women better
ootliers and more companionable wives"
âthis only a fraction of the mass of
compelling facts.
Poor Dr. Clampett!â not to hare heard
this debate.

Proceedings In eminent domain before
Superior Judge Seawell for the purpose
cf condemning a right of way through
the city for the Ocean i Shore | Railway
Company have been brought to a con
clusion and judgment against the com
pany, issued upon its own initiative, has
been entered for a total of about $SOO,
000 -and in favor of some hundred and
fifty defendants, joined in forty-three
separate actions.
Tho conclusiqn of this litigation has
affirmed title in the new railway company,
whose route promises to be the most
picturesque in California, to a strip of
land extending from Kentucky and Army
streets in a general south westerly direc
tion to the ocean shore and thence fol
lowing the meanderings of the beach
south to the pretty city of Santa Cruz on
the shores of Monterey bay.
The completion of the scenic route is
thus assured. Not only will property in
that portion of the city through which
the tracks of the company run increase
in value, but the realty market in gen
eral will be stimulated, for the people
that have disposed of their holdings to
the company must now find homes else
where. ,\u25a0 This means the immediate in
vestment of at least a larger portion of
the 5500.000 that will come from) the cof
fers of the company in payment for Its
right of way.

suits that have now been disposed of

POLACCO WINS
NEW HONORS
AT THE TIVOLI
i Bravo, bravisslmo, Polacco!
Bravo! bravissimo, Orchestra!
I^ast night the conductor, magnificently
crowned his season with one of the best
symphony concert's ever given here at ariy
time by any one. and to an audience large
and brilliantly responsive. The occasion
was the farewell night of the grand op
era season, and a testimonial benefit to
the adored conductor. With the Tivoli
Fifty an . additional . eighteen musicians
were in evidence, and the "Erotca,"
Weber's "Invitation a la Valse," Salnt-
Saens' "Le Rouet d'Omphale," and the
Wasner "Prelude and Death of Isolde"
and "Tannhauscr" overture.;
Detailed mention of the concert I shall
have b3 defer- until 1 Sunday; but this to
say that leader and men ; covered them
selves with glory. Tho difference between
the man who leads and the man who
merely beats time Polacco never more
brilliantly exemplified. And the wealth
and worth of the local material was never
more triumphantly in evidence. .Almost
pathetic was the joy of the men In their,
work, and Polacco was in electrical mood.
Possibly the best thins sriven was the
"Prelude and Death of Isolde"â one un
derstood, hearing it, why Wagner loved
Wagner a l'ltalien. ,But the Beethoven
was splendidly played, full of the classic
feeling, dignified. . reposeful and withal
surging with temperament. .Weinsart
ner's "Invitation to the Waltz" proved
a delightful arrangement, delightfully
played, and "Le Rouet d'Omphale" was
a little marvel' of finesse and delicacy,
the strings, miraculous. The . "Tannhau
ser" overture closed the programme with
a shout , of triumph V that the audience
echoed and rpochoed, and echoed again.
Wreaths', loving-cups, various silver
gauds were showered upon the conductor,
who could Imrdly get away from the
plaudits. At least there Is no doubt as
to . the estimation in which Polacco jj is
held, nor the. strength ; of the local hope
of his return.

book is : a revelation
to students of comic
operas. In that It
has . rare consis
tency and a very
evident plot; then
too, the lyrics have
weight and are not
tho usually Sense
less jingles most au
thors throw Into
their books, sup
posedly by the w,ay
of good measure.
The choosing of
Korea as the locale
of the atory per
mitted Mr. - Savage
and scenic * artists
to evolve some very original and striking
stage pictures - so ! far as costumes and
stage epuipment were concerned. It has
been said that "The Sho Gun" is one of
the most beautifully mounted productions
ever sent out with the Henry W. Savage
trade mark upon It- In the cast Mr.
Savage will present John E. Henshaw,

May Ten Broeck, T. C. Leary, Genevieve

and an exceedingly welt trained and
handsome chorus.

"The complimentary tickets are limited
to 490, but each fighter is to get one
'â¢stage box." Eddie Graney has been
agreed upon for referee. He will .receive
a fee not to exceed $500, which will be
paid out of the gross receipts.
Fitesimmons has not selected his train
ing quarters yet. He fancies either San
Fotf ael or Alatneda. He requires a warm
er climate than that of this city.
Billy Roche, who went on the road with,
a bÂ« of the Brltt-NelÃon pictures, has re
turned. He cleared $27,000 in a few weeks
around Cincinnati. They wore a success
everywhere except in New York. Willie
Britt had them there and had to match
his skill as a promoter against that of the
giants of the theatrical trust. "Willus"
lost. Manager Coffroth has opened an
office on Broadway from which point of
Vantage he is directing the movements of
the man with the fight films. A number
of new fighters are to be seen at his Col
xna Club. The following dispatch was re
ceived last night:
NEW YORK, Nov. IS.â Willie Lewis has
been engaged by Jimmy Coffroth to go to
'the coast and fight before his club. Cof
froth signed L#wls to meet the winner of
the twenty-round bout between Jimmy
Gardner and "Twin". Sullivan, which is
to be fought before the Hayes Valley Ath
letic Club of San Francisco on the 24th
lnst.
Coffroth is anxious to. have Lewis fight
on the coast, as he thinks he is a better
fighter than most people give him credit
for being.
I Coffroth will also send out Abe Attell,
â¢Russell, Young and others new to ring

Every parttrf the body is dependent on the blood for nourishment and
Strength, and when from any cause this vital stream of life becomes impov-
erished or run-down, it invites disease to enter. No one can beTwell when the
blood is impure; they lack the energy that is natural jrith health, the com-
plexion becomes pale and sallow, the vital energies are at a low ;,ebb, and they
suffer from a general broken-down condition of Health. The system is weak-
; â¬ned and tinable to resist the diseases and disorders that are constantly assail-
ing it. The Liver and Kidneys, failing to' receive the'properstimulatiori arid
nourishment from the blood, grow inactive arid dull; and the waste* matters

are left in the system to pioduce Rheumatism^: Catarrh; ' ; Sores and Ulcers,
Skin Diseases or some other blood disorder. When the blood is in this weak-;

The Seals got thelfs at Recreation
Park yesterday because the Giants
were there with a better brand of
baseball. No one flg-ured the bunch
from Portland would cut In with many
victories judging from past perform
ances. The wise ones are now willing
to hand It to the HcCreedie layout for
being: able to perform sometimes. They
played uphill ball yesterday, but. it
never bothered them when they got
the biff start.
"Bumpus" Jones was pounded some
by the Harris combination, but the
way Atr. Schlafley and the others guth'
ered the hot ones pulled the south
winger out of many a bad looking
hole. McLean could whip 'em around
the bagrs for a falr-ye-well, while poor
old Parke "Wilson never seemed able
to head off any one no matter how
slow he moved.
The Seals looked like three-time
winners when they waded in, and
quickly took possession of '.the lead,
with four runs in the second and third
spasms. Gochnauer started the good
work by getting a pass and Wilson
made the ancient fans' thoughts wan
der back to the old days when he
ripped off a double, scoring Johnny.
Henley advanced Parke on an out. and
Jones got bad again, passing Waldron.
Wally quickly stole, and they all reg
istered on Kid Mohler's two-sacker up
against the center field fence.
That lead of three looked good, bu^t
when It was increased to four In the
next period every one was willing to
concede victory to the Seals without
figuring the Giants at all. Portland
slipped the big sensation in during the
fifth. Jones was safe on Gochnauer's
boot and Atz came through with a
single. '. Van Buren moved both along
on his .bunt, -after which^ McHale' re
sponded with a drive to left that went
for two bags. He took third â¢on the
throw and after Schlafley had worked
for a base on balls they : pulled off a
double steal.' Big McLean unloaded a
Texas leaguer to left field, letting both
men tear in.
After that the"Giants could do any
thing with the ball. They kept grab
bing all kinds of hard chances and
the Seals could not get men on the
packs. Wilson was given two -lives on
the- bases in the third on close deci
sions and this alone saved San Fran
cisco from a worse "humiliation. ,- The
score: " .

â¢If there had been an automobile to carry-
San '- Nicolas the black horse , would I pos
sibly have been beaten in! the' slooo Kings
ton handicap yesterday at Oakland. .
-The distance was a mile and fifty, yards
and the handicapper had asked ".Packy"
Ryan's black gentleman to shoulder 116
pounds, imposing lesser weights -on
Bragg, Watercure, Rightful and Lubin..
San | Nicolas suited the * market hunters
all right, for they eagerly snapped up.all
the 9 to 10 in ' sight. / The long range
players landed on Rightful, from Captain
Rice's stable. / â¢
Watercure looked as much at home/fas
an Easterner does shelling shrimps, but
he had a following anyway. Willie Da
vis got the favorite away jumping at the
start and nothing ever got within tele
phone call' of the. black. But tor getting
his dates mixed eighty yards or so from
the wire, Goodchild would have been Bec
ond with Rightful. As it was, Rice
crawled up on the inside, dropping Lubin,
a 60 to 1 shot, down second by a . neck.
SCRHEIBER'S COLORS IN FRONT.
\u25a0 The weather was warm enough > for
summer clothing, and a large crowd
crossed the bay. Favorites behaved fair
ly; well, capturing three of the offerings!!
Barney Schreiber drew down his first
> purse ; at the 1 meeting, with Buchanan,*
winner of and; favorite for the Intro
ductory . mile selling event.* It was a
mixed piokle affair, and Schade got the
black gelding away In front.* At the
close he was hard pressed; by ; Davis
on Dlxelle, but succeeded in winning
by nearly ailength. Maid of -Fermoy
was ; undoubtedly best, ; for, after; leav
ing the gate, lnjoneof the rear^ posi
tions, the filly finished a close third. .â¢
; Sir Edward arid f I'm * Joe ; met again
In the: two-year-old > scramble over
five furlongs," . and j the first-named colt
turned ' the tables Ton the ' little : fellow.
Sir. Edward opened up favorite, but at
bugle call-Joe had a slight; call in -.the
'betting. The (pair shook "the , rest of
the field tffthe start/ Kriapp, astride
I'm Joe, cut of^ Tommy /Clark a fur

stretch a .'couple of lengths to the
good. Handridlng nlsT f mount; hard,
Clark gradually wore r down Joe's
advantage, earning. , a nose . decision.
Loague took the show : with Equorum
Rex. .
CRUZADOS A STRONG CHOICE.
None but the high flyers could place a
wager on Cruzados, the crack Baldwin
sprinter being held " at ; the '\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0 prohibitive
price of 1 to 6 for the* five and a half fur

WHALING CRUISE
Bark Andrew Hicks Conies
From Okhotsk Sea With
Kich Cargo of Oil and Bone
ENCOUNTERS HURRICANE
Brings Word of Mutinies on
the John and Winthrop
and the Schooner Gotama
The whaling bark Andrew Hicks,
Captain Thomas Scullan, arrived yes
terday, forty-three days from the
Okhotsk Bea_ She had been hunting
iv hales Bine* December, 1904, and
t rcugb-t back as a result. of nearly a
: ear's work 1000 pounds of bone and
barrel* of oil. Eight sperm whales
n&d two bowheads fell to hdr harpoons.
There will be profit for owners and
raptÂ«tn. but only U apiece for the men
who did the hard work and the dirty work
and who, between spell* of toll, slept
la a forecastle that a seX-respecting
xJ-.ickeu or. & well-reared dog would
ioreake as uninhabitable.
The Andrew Hicks encountered two
heavy etorms. On September 2Â«, while
anchored in Shauter Bay, - a heavy
rorthwester swept down on the little
ba:k. One anchor chain parted, the
other was let go in a Uurry and for
\u25a0several hours the vessel was driven at
The will of the storm. A regular hur
ricane was encountered October 27 and
rs In latitude 43 north, longitude 155
Â«'Â«t Two boats were smashed, sails
-vvcre carried away and other damage
Imiicted. During one spell of live hours
the vessel lay on her beam tJide,
On the day the first storm was en
countered the Andrew Hicks epoke the
schooner Gotama, with four whales, and
the bark John and Winthrop, with
three whales.
The men ot the John and Winthrop
liad mutinied on account, say those ou
the Andrew Hicks, of the poor food
Â«erved and the cruel treatment accorded
them by Captain \V. T. Shorey and his
officers. There was trouble also on the
tiotama and two men, J. Curley and H.
Jensen, had been put in irons for five
days.
At the RuESi&n settlement of Dc-obere
the Andrew Hicks was boarded by a
man named Cassius, who had deserted,
lie said, from the John and Wlnthrop
a year ago. He had been living with
the natives, who treated him unkindly.
He w*Â» sick and wanted Captain Scul
lan to take him back to San Francisco.
Scullan refused on the ground that be
might get into trouble with the Cus
tom-house if he brought home a man
whose name did not appear on the
â¢hip's articles. He advised Cassius to
fro back tc the John and Winthrop.
Cassius said that life with the natives
was bad enough, but paradise com
pared with the John and Winthrop's
forecastle and he would stay at Deo
bere. TUe captain of the Gotama also,
it is said, refused Cassius a passage
home.
The men on the Andrew Hicks, al
though all induced to go whaling by
the usual misrepresentations, speak
wet] of the way Captain Scullan and
l.:s officers treated them. The food was
unfit for human consumption, they say,
and the forecastle an e%-il smelling nest,
tiut the skipper, they say. did what
he could to lighten for them the burden
at their lot.
"I shipped for what I was told would
be a three months' trading cruise in the
South Seas," said one of the green
hands. "I was told I could make 5400
without any difficulty and probably
twice as much. I signed a receipt for
an . advance of $35. The man who
shipped me drew the money and bought
for me about $\u2666 worth of shoddy
clothes."
"'Where's the rest ( of the advance? 1 I
asked.
"Oh, that's all rigrht. What you don't
spend now will be saved."
"It was saved all right. But not by
or for me."
Nearly every green hand that returns
from a whaling voyage has a similar
tale to tell. The few clothes bought
out of this advance and $1 which they
receive at the' end of tfle cruise and a
long ride is all that ninety-nine out of a
hundred green hands ever can hope to
epet out of a whaling cruise.
Eut when the fleet goes to 6ea again
each vessel will carry a full crew.
The Andrew Hicks brings word of
the almost tragic ending of a quarrel
between two members of the Gotama's
crew. A whale had been sighted and
a boat was launched from the schooner.
The officer in charge of tli# boat and
the boat header were intoxicated and
before they had pulled many lengths
from the Gotama tbe drunken men be
came involved in a quarrel. ' Blows
\u25a0were struck. Each man looked around
for a weapon and both at the same in
stant caw the gun used for shooting
bombs into whales. It was a dead heat
to the gun. Then a wrrstling match.
One of the contestants reached tbe
trigger, fired the gun and the bomb
carried away thejjow of the boat. Two
other boats wore launched and the men
in tho bowk'Ps /-raft were all picked up.
This is *afd to Â»Â»<* only one of toe in
cidents which enlivened the Gotama's
cruise. â -

Eeeent Move Attracts the
Attention of Wholesale
Houses on This Coast
Commercial, organizations in this
city have be^n requested by the Pacific
Coast ' Hardware and Metal Association
to oppose' an orders recently issued toy.
the FoiTrthi N Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral that may make it easier for mall
order " house* to lisa the mails for tbe
transaction; of mercantile business to
the' detriment, of the wholesalers and
jobbers and. also of many retailers.
The -order referred to abolished the
names from the rural, delivery boxes
.and substituted numbers therefor, so
that every rural delivery box will soon
have a number unless the order is
modified.'
The advantage that can be gained
by -the mail order houses by the pro
posed new.arrangement Is explained to
consist }n' the. case and tittle cost with
which ! the rural population may be
reached. Mail ,of*de.r houses have pro
vided lar^e nTaijinp 4 ist3 heretofore, at
considÂ«rableÂ«xpeniÂ»Â£J to Insure the re
ceipt of packages *6f advertising: cir
culars and. other matter to enable them
to get into touch withthe rural popu
lation. When every box is numbered
It -will only be necessary to have a
knowledge of the number of boxes In
any district as a preliminary for send
ing broadcast th? advertising matter
railing 'attention to mail order house 3.
When the facts became known to the
Pacific Coast Hardware and Metal As
sociation letters were written to other
commercial organization* requesting 1
them to take "action. The mail order
matter would therefore seem as likely
to be again discussed at some length
on this coast. \u25a0 -'

J. S. Eacho & Co. of New Tork itr:
â¢ The unscttlement in the local franchise
croup, coupled with call money the highest
â¢ i rice ] 903, brought about genuine liquidation
Â«.nd lower prices. The closely held specialties,
Anitrlcan Smelting and Refining Issues and
Heading common were marked exceptions to
troneral weakness, and the action of these two
â¢ locks Illustrates dearly the character of the
*avanee In the high-price-d Issues. Stocks cf
thiÂ» character are etui largely in the hands;
of Insiders, and the public up to the present 1
time has shown little or no disposition to taUe
I \u25a0 I of them. Banking Interests did not look
*vith favor en the frequent spectacular ad
vances, and, as we pointed out recently, on
unfavorable developments, it !Â« the general liet,
rot the s;<-cia'.ties, that suffer.
"YVr.st interest the public has In the market
â¢ â¢-^nis to be confined to low-priced coppers,
railroad arid industrial issues. For thÂ« better i
known of these securities there has for some i
time hack be<n a genuine public demand, but t
\u25a0*hothÂ»r tl:is In time will broaden to thÂ« high- !
jj:lc*<d stocks Is a question which Insiders are \u25a0
â¢ r.xiously v.etK-hing. The trouble seema to be
that the dividend payers generally are thought j
too blst for the average man to consider pur- :
<haÂ«<*. Business and Industrial conditions;
*onsldere<3. ttocks are not dear and the under- j
lying factors in the Fhuation would geem to \
Justify hish^r price* In time. The banking ;
position is sound Â».::(! as jet there has been no
Â«n ersjw?culatlon. Hence the course of the mar
ket will ;>: c:: i latTeiy on fresh public Interest. !
Money in all probability will remain flrm dur
tnp tb* balance of the year. and. lt would not
Ik- Burpriyirp If higher call moneys rates 6houiJ
trfvaii in the first week of December. An
other factor to be considered iÂ« thÂ» railroad
rate Initiation to come before Conirresa.
â¢"The c!tuÂ»t!on. Eummed up briefly, la that

r"or the immediate future railroad rate legis
lation rr.ay exercise an important Influence,
while opposed to these adverse Influences Is
the eo!ld wall of prosperity which Is aasured
for fully a y?ar to come.
"While there will perhar* be break* In
prices from time to time on account cf the
prevailing- hiph rates for money, we feel that
the market will so higher In the lonr run."

NEW' YORK, Nov. 15. â Stocks made further
recover}' to-day unCer the Influence of return
of confidence In the money outlook. There
\u25a0was continued stringency in the money market,
but it was less severe than on yesterday, as
yesterday's was less severe than on Monday,
While rates were not so high ax yesterday ex
the maximum they were well above the nor
mal. But it was obvious that at the pre
vailing ratfs sufficient funds were to be had
to mwt the demand. There was no further
evidence of forced liquidation in consequence
of lack of funds. Active discussion etill cen
tered on the money situation and its prin
cipal phase to-day was as to the means which
had !\u25a0,â¢<\u25a0:: used to ease the situation. It is
x.ot commonly believed that anything like suf
ficient liquidation of stocks or reduction 01
loans has . been effected to accomplish the
easit-r conditions in the money market. It
is known that very heavy resort has b?eÂ«.
jDoade to other money tenters to take over
ir-<- credits which were being forced to wt
t>ment by the money stringency here and the
kttraction nt the hijrh interest rates made this
feasible by bringing in large offerings of
foreign money to the New York market. The
operation in the pursuit of the game end
has been a large transfer of speculative hold
ings from New York to foreign markets. This
was accomplished by sa is of stocks here anil
repurchases of the same issues in foreign
markets." A parallel operation was the pay
ing off of loans in New York by which thÂ«
Ftocks were held and the borrowing for a
tirailar purpose in the foreign money market.
The London demand for stocks here is be.
lieved to be the result of this process and
rhowf the offsetting effect of the operation in
one martcct against the other. The high
money rates also has attracted funds from out
of town i>oints both in Canada and in thÂ«
West. There is outfpoken discussion arduna
the Stock Exr-fcange of a supposition that thfc
banks have, determined themselves authorised
to make further encroachments on their re
etrves in spite of the deficit â¢ below legal re
quirements shown Saturday in the bank state
merit. Some of the speculative comment oa
the situation affords to the published utter
ances of the Secretary of the Treasury an In
ferential sanction 'to thlÂ« action in ca*e of
Its being: necessary to avoid financial trouble.
It is pointed out that the issuance of a Call
upon r. sÂ«i iir.nl banks to report their condition
an of November 9 .relieves them from the ne
cessity of' keeping up reserves for the pur.
pose of window dressing a* Is admittedly
customary In anticipation of the* Comptroller's
call. A similar call was.cent out to-day by
ihe banking department at Albany for a state
ment or the condition of the State banks end
trurt companies, also as of November 9. The
came condition therefore applies' to the trust
companies in this matter as to the banks.
With the relaxation In the money, rate to
lay sterling exchange became strong again
laid turned decisively away from the gold
*Â«Â»n>ort point. " A scrutiny of price changes
irade during the flay discloses bow large a
part was played In It by specialties ag dis
tinguished from the general standard market
leaders. Large covering of shorts was un->
loubtedlv an important factor and In stocks
under pool control the movement against the
.horts was especially aggressive. The strength
!n other individual Ftocks was attributed td
special causes, although they were not always
tnown. Hocking Valley had an extraordinary
\u25a0novement on supposition of the coming re
crement or the preferred etock. Buying ot
.he KanEas and Texas 6tocks was alleged to
je la the Burlington interest. Advances in
Southern stocks may hare been In connection
*-lth.thÂ« more liberal estimates of the cotton
rop. Standard Oil dividend was ' a help to
he market. Th* profit-taking In the late
Jealins* made only a slight Imoreeslon oa
he closing. whSch was generally strong.
Bonds were firm. Total sales, par ..value,

yesterday became disheartened ; and threw over
the balance " of their large lines, while some
of them actually took -the 1 short Bide, arter

try tributary ' to San Francisco, we find . 157.CC0
tons available for \u25a0 this market; on the first
of November last there were but .142.C00. The
dally consumption in San T Francisco is .esti
mated at 500 tons; this would make the total
season's supply only 180.000 tons, so that, with
five months already , lapsed it, would seem. that
we \u25a0 have much more s than enough to * carry us
through. : I>ast year we had sufficient .quantity
for all. purposes and had to ship Southern Cali
fornia at least 15, 0â¬0 tons. ; while the Russian
and American Governments must have; taken
close on to 10,000 tons more. This year there
is undoubtedly more Hay being fed throughout
the Interior of the State, but Southern Cali
fornia has taken but little and none is being
shipped to the Orient At the present writing
It -, would -seem, therefore, : that with an open
winter the market will be J badly depressed In
the spring."

YOUTHFUL, PRISONERS ARE
ADMITTED TO PROBATION
Judges Show Clemency In Case of Wil
liam Gordon and George "\V. Van
Leuck.
Two \u25a0 prisoners who pleaded guilty,
the one to a charge of grand larceny
and the other to. two charges of bur
glary, were /allowed to go on probation
yesterday.' William Gordon was
vouched for to Judge Dunne by Captain
C. E. A, Creighton of the army, who
said he had known the youth and his
parents in the East for many years.
The young man had fallen into temp
tation, here, but Captain Creighton
promised that if given a chance Gor
don would behave himself. The Judge
suspended sentence and appointed
Captain Creighton probationary officer.
Gordon on the. night of September 3
stole a purse from Joseph Dominguez
in a dance hall on Pacific street.
George W. Van Leuck is only 16
years of age. While employed as a
bellboy at 418 Sutter street he en
tered the rooms of- Herbert L. Landls
and Joseph C. Brockover and stole
; some jewelry. He pleaded guilty to
. two charges of burglary before Judge
Cook. The Judge suspended sentence
and allowed him to go on probation for
two years and instructed him to report
once each week to Charles Montgom
ery, probationary officer.
Mrs. Browning said that "books fare
men of higher stature." If, now and
then, you like to buy a few "men of
higher stature" at bargain' prices,
watch the store advertisements.

oath that she never' i - obbed nobody."," This
kickin' gent ought to be ashamed Â£ : of
hisself. If,he lost his money Ella didn't
get it."
There was bitter reproach in the glance
that Miss Wood, unveiled and dark -vis
aged, shot at the "kickin' gent" while
her honesty was thus being extolled,, but'
it merely served. to accentuate the grim
ness, of the smile with ; which -he had
hearkened to Miss Brown's testimony. '?
Grand larceny was the charge against
Miss Wood, and the complainant, regis
tered as John H. Shelton, mining man,
residing at the Hotel Sutherland, swore
that she pilfered from him a sum of $150
in gold coin while ho was ciceroning her
and Miss Brown through the redlight dis
trict one recent evening. It was on Mar
ket street that he met the ladies that
same evening and without awaiting for
mal introduction requested the pleasure
of their company. They rebuked his
boldness- by asking him what he meant
by it, and when he explained that he was
a lonesome stranger in the city thelr/re
sentment gave way to pity and they ac
cepted his guardianship on the proposed
tour.
* "But you mus'n't take us anywhere
that ain't entirely proper," they chor
used, warningly, "for \u25a0 we're rest'rant
waitresses with reppytatlons to perserve."
He escorted them to the first block of
O'Farrell street and there proved his
solicitude for the preservation of _ their
fair fame by showing them the interiors
of various free music halls. His discrim
inative bestowal of attention made it ap
parent that Miss Brown was de trop, but
she bravely ignored his neglect and un
complainingly partook of his liquefied
hospitality, because she did not desire to
spoil the. splendid time which her ' chum
was having. Finally, when the round of
sightseeing was completed, the ladies
clared that they must go home, as their
vocation necessitated ' early rising, and
Mr. Shelton gallantly escorted them to
their Joint abode on Ellis street. ? There
he left them, after having bidden Miss
Wood an exceptionally, tender au revoir,
and half-an-hour later they were awak
ened from slumber by a policeman, who,
acting under Mr. Shelton's instruction,
arrested Miss Wood and 'booked her. for
grand larceny. . <
"I had a hundred and fifty in loose twen
ties in one of my hip pockets," Mr.'Shel
ton averred, "and while . I ' was blddirig
this brunette i goodnight " she must have
dipped and, got. 'em." â¢.
But no golden coins were found either
on the person : of . Miss Wood or,- in her
apartment, and when she .told Police
Judge Mogan that; she could crowd his
courtroom with â¢ reputable persons . able
and willing to vouch for her lifelong hon
esty he gave her until this morning ' to

Bitter Defense to His
â¢Action for a Divorce
DEMANDS BIG SUM
FOR HEE MAINTENANCE
Asserts That Husband's Crur
ejty Drove Her to 'Take
S Her Little â¢ Daughter 'and
Flee to Her Mother's Home
Asserting that she. is guiltless of.wrong
doing and that" her husband's - charges
against her honor are unequivocally false,-
Mrs. Emma Pauson joined issue yesterday
afternoon in j the action for. divorce Insti
tuted against her by Samuel B. yPausun,
president of one of, San; Francisco's larg-'
est 'clothing firms. It. was no act of hers,
she says, : that 'disrupted; her home, but,
she asserts. It ,was ; the causeless cruelty
of Samuel 8. . Pauson himself that drove
her to abandon him and seek. comfort and
sympathy in' the New -York home of her
mother, .where ahe now resides.
. Mrs. Pauson's"*: spirited answer to her
husband's accusations Is made in an ap
plication'filed by her demanding that the
court? award her $500 a month alimony
pending the final adjudication of the . ac
tion for divorce instituted against her.
that he ' compensate her attorneys and
provide her ''with means with which to
take depositions and secure the presence
of witnesses who, she asserts, will prove
her "; innocent of the accusations laid
against her.
A BAYS SUB NEEDS FUNDS.
Continuing in gentler strain Mrs. Pau
son asks that in addition to an order: for ;
$500 a month alimony the court direct her
husband to pay her , forthwith \u25a0\u25a0' $2500 for
her immediate needs'. ". "I am without
funds," she says, "with which to main
tain myself and my little daughter Ar
line. who is with me, and furthermore,
another little one will soon be , born to
me." - â¢ For medical attendance and the
care she says she requires in 1 anticipation
of the visit ; of the stork ; the additional
sum of $2500 she asks, she asserts, is none
too much, and as she is- in immediate
need of financial assistance he asks that
it be awarded her with as little delay as
the machinery of the law will permit.
She says: ; <
Mr. Pauson. plaintiff In this action, la~j.
wealthy man, being worth more than $250,000.
Ho enjoys an annual income of $50,000, being? a
heavy stockholder In the Techau Tavern, the
Central Ught and Power Company. Pauson &
Co. 1 which Is Incorporated with a capital stock
of' $1 000,000- and nets an annual ? profit of
$70 000. a Large part of which goes to the plain
tiff in this action, and .Is also heavily Inter
ested in the San Francisco Pipe and Oil Com
pany;, and other corporations from .which he
enjoys an Income. 'â¢. "' '_â¢-â¢
While this defendant resided with Mr. Pau
son their ; yearly household , expenses wera
about $12.000,. the servants, clothing and table
requiring this annual expenditure. \u25a0 In view of
this fact this defendant should be allowed the
sum demanded; whtch Is $6000 a year, or one
halt of .the annual expenses of the former
household. .Furthermore, It is the Intention of
this defendant Â»to return to San Francisco from
New York and contest the action for divorce,
knowing that the charges are false, and for
traveling expenses money will be needed.
SCANDAL WILSi DEVELOP.
The affidavit was prepared in New York
City and presented In <â the litigation by
John J. Barrett, who will represent Mrs.
Pauson at 1 the trial of -. the suit." So it Is
that the wife of Samuel Bl Pauson meets
the allegations he believed would obtain
f or, him ; a ; divorce without contest.
Named as corespondents In his action for
divorce are the young, eons of several of
San Francisco's .most prominent Jewish
families. While their names have_ not yet
been ' made public, the court having or
dered the papers withheld -from, the pub-,

asserted that It was not Mrs. Sharp's In

asked leave through his attorneys, Ma
guire, Lindsay and-Wykoff, to amend his
complaint.> . v :

ing the contestant had taken the. case
upon a, contingent fee of 50 per cent of
what they; could get, out of It, and that
such a Bchemehad been held by the Su
preme Court to be against public policy.
