REGARDS AMERICA AS AIXY.-
The Times' Tokio correspondent says
that in recent speeches by publicists
the claim was made that Japan was
fightinjr for Anglo-Saxon ideals in
Asia instead of military despotism, and
that several Tokio Journals rejoice that
"America is now in the same camp
with Japan."'
The Russian corres. ndent of the
Times hears that a special council pre
sided over by the Czar arrived, at the
conclusion that war should *-e avoided.
The inference, they say. is that the
speech of Premier Balfour at Man
chester on Jan nary li. in which he
said '"no one can contemplate hostili
ties between two rrect - :zed con -
tries without fselings 0/ misgivings
and of depression." declaring that
Great Britain would tarry out to the
fullest extent all her treaty c**Iigattons,
greatly influence*! this decision.
It Is reported that, as a result of this
conclusion. Russia intends to open
ports in Manchuria, withdraw her pre
tensions with regard to' KorÂ« -. and.
possibly, even not retain Pert Arthur
as a. military stronghold.
The correspondent cf the Times at
Mosctv comments' on the severity of
"Of course, any attempt of Russia to
increase very largely her naval forces
in the East by moving her Black Sea cr
Baltic fieet3 would make war a question
of only a few hours."
This statement seems to be bcrne out
by dispatches from Tokio yesterday
that Japan had received Russia's com
munication saying that Russia would
respect the right3 and privileges al
ready acquired by the powers in Man
churia, under the existing treaties with
China, except in the case off the estab
lishment of foreign settlements, which
show3 that negotiations are continuing
on the -question of Manchuria. '
At the Japanese legation to-nJg&t it
was said that no fresh news had been
received and that the situation re
mained unchanged.
In what it claims as an authoritative
statement the Daily Graphic thi3 morn
ing announces that the peace negotia
tions have arrived at a stage leaving
two points upon which neither Russia |
nor Japan 13 inclined to yield and as to I
which no means of a compromise have
yet been found. Both of these points
concern Manchuria, and their accept
ance would not In the slightest modify
the legal status quo or change the ad
ministrative situation in Manchuria:
but Jar>an insists "that they be em
bodied in a treaty between Japan and
Russia." while Russia, as a matter cf
amour propre. refuses to accept such
dictation at the hands of Japan. Much.
however, is still hoped from the Czar's
influence. The statement adds:
"China's firm stand since the reoccu- j
pation of Moukden has complicated the
Russian arangements in Manchuria for
defense and doubled the difficulties of
guarding the long line of communica
tion between the boundaries and the
coast line. The council of war is sit
ting daily. The port of Newchwang

The most itartling developments
have come to light in the Investiga
tion by the police of the murder of : J*j
seph Blaise, for which crime Leon
Soever, brother-in-law of the dead
man, is under arrest.
Not only do the police claim that
Soeder's hand was the one that ended
the life of Blaise a week ago Sunday
night at the foot of Russian Hill, but
that he was one of a gang of conspira
tors who plotted to end a human life
in order to swindle insurance conxpa.
i nies.
It Is known that the police are shad
j owing certain persons in this city, and
two and possibly three more arrests
may be made at any time in connec
tion -with the murder of Blaise.
The theory of the police, based upon
information no-w in their possession,
is that the plot to find a victim in Eu
rope and bring him to this country to
be heavily insured and then murdered
was hatched five months ago.
One of the conspirators is supposed
I to be a saloon-keeper in this city, who
I has made a fortune .in the lowest
! walks of life. A second conspirator is
supposed to have left the city In the
last few days and his Identity is care
fully guarded by the police. The third
i conspirator is known to be a wealthy
i man, but absolutely unscrupulous in
i his greed for money.
The police believe that Soeder, who
is charged with the murder of Blaise,
j was induced to join the conspirators
on account of his record as an ex-con
vict and his implication in undiscov
ered crimes."
FURNISHED FUNDS FOR SOEDER.
: *-Â¦- Sceder_wax faj .iheJta&Jfcct 'Jap&tljig
of his connection with rich families in
! Germany and the police theory Is that
j the conspirators hoped when he joined
j them that he would be able to secure
, a victim whose standing would secure
Â¦ a very large insurance from the* com-
I panies.
It is said that the conspirators fur
nished Soeder with the funds to go to
Germany and bring hia victim to
America.
The police have been busily engaged
in tracing money remittances sent
from this city to Soeder in New York
City and so Europe.
Time is all that the police ask for
the full clearing up of" the case, and
this undoubtedly will be granted by
the courts. Detective Tom Gibson
said last night in an interview:
_ 'This man Seeder is undoubtedly the
murderer of Joseph Blaise. It took
five months to hatch the plot and I
have had only six days to prove his
guilt. It is a far-reaching case, and
to establish the guilt requires the gath
ering of the tangled ends, which will
require some time. "We have proof
enough to hold him at present, but we
must have delay."
"Is your demand for delay based on
the fact that you believe you can im
plicate others in the crime?" he was
asked.
, "I can't answer any questions in that
regard," he replied.
"Do you think the conspiracy to
murder this man Blaise extends to
Germany?" he was asked.
"There is another question I can't
answer." he replied. "Only give us
time enough and we will make this
the most interesting murder trial that
has ever occurred in San Francisco.'*
Evidence is now in the possession of
The, police tfceory is that when the
fellow* conspirators-,- of Soeder found
that the vietlni of the plo* was a sim
ple young iGeraaa hotel keeper and a
cook and that no large sums of insur
ance could, be secured on his life, they
demanded of Soeder -t_at he kill Blaise
kf::*s&fz:: to- ** reiailmr* * /'Jfeeni * far* 1 , the Â¦
money adxaneÂ«d to SoMer to gÂ»-. to
Germany. Failing In this, Soeder was
threatened with exposure to the police
for many crimes in. which he was im
plicated, including the suspicious death
of his wife in Petaluma.
Money was refused to Soeder by his
fellow conspirators. He was in des
perate straits and on the second week
cf his axrival*did not have enough to
pay his room rent of $3 5d. according to
the statement of J. Nibtaus, of whom
he rented a room, at 827 Jackson
street.
Soeder's statement that Blaise had
money in his possession and that he
was murdered by Â». robber has been
proved to be false. The police have a
cablegram in their possession stating
that Blais did not take any money
with him from his home.
. The police think that Soeder painted
a roseate story to Blaise of ir^e golden
prospects in America and offered to
pay all expenses and that the unfortu
nate man accepted the terms and came
to America only to meet an awful end
by the knife of his relative.
SUPPOSED BROTHER. . .
The police also think that It was the*
intention of the conspirators that See
der should kill Blaise in New York
City or on the overland train, provided
Blaise's life could be heavily insured
in the metropolis.
Finding it was impossible to secure
insurance in New York. Soeder brought
his victim across the continent to thi3
city.
Detective Gibson is satisfied that Soe
der. while cunning, is also a bungler
in crime and that the full fiendishness
of the foul slaughter of Blaise will
be shown in all its awful details.
Gibson spent many hours yesterday
DEMANDED VICTIM'S DEATH.
The detectives have learned that pre
vious to Soeder leaving for Germany he
was r.lmost penniless. He traded on
his reputation as a cook to seccre free
meals at 2 cheap restaurant on the
Barbary Coast.
Suddenly Soeder announced his inten
tion, to take a trip abroad. He" j.aid his
debts and departed" in good style.
Seeder's return with" his brothjr-in-^aw,
Blaise, gave deep affront to the conspir
ators, . who expected to find that the
pros; ective victim of murder would be
a m--i of good social and commercial
standing.
On arriving in New York Soeder ap
plied for a policy of $10j5CO on the life of
Blaise. In San Francisco he again ap
plied'for another policy of the same
amount. He then .secured two policies
for-COOO eacby theÂ£large sum of $10,000
being denied. by the insurance com
pany. ..*-Â¦ >.- -"'
the police tending to show that before
Soeder and his victim, Blaise, sailed
from Europe an application was made
to a life insurance company in Bremen
for a large* policy on Blaise, but that It
was refused by the company when it
was learned that Blaise was but a
humble hotel keeper in a little village.
Cablegrams are now in the oosses
sicn of Chief of Police WLtmaÂ» on
these lines, but time tvEII be required
for the evidence to- be legally taken in
Germany and forwarded to this coun
try.
Soeder also made another proposition
to Cannon, who is an ex-convict and
has done three years in the State's
prison for forgery, but the police re
fuse to divulge the nature of this pro
posal. From the evidence that a plot,
to murder for gain, was worked out
during the last five months by Soeder
and accomplices, it i3 believed that
Soeder made a proposition, to Can
non to join the conspirators and take
a portion of the results In insurance
money which they expected to get
on the lite of Blaise. The fact that
Soeder wanted to take into his con
fidence a man who has a term
in the penitentiary shows that he had
work to do that only a man with a
criminal record would do. The police,
as usual, refuse to give out Just what
took place when they interviewed Can
non, but the facts above mentioned
are known to be true.
The fact that Soeder promised to give
Cannon $10 a day for an Indefinite
length of time and a lump, sum of $200,
in the light of the fact that it is posi
tively known that Soeder had no mon
ey and was almost without a cent at
the time of Blaise's death. show3 that
he expected to receive a sum of money
in a short time.
_ That Soeder was ready to go
to any extreme to carry out hl3-> de
signs is shown, by the testimony given
to . the police by Frank Cannon. Can
non, told â¢-Â¦ Detective Thomas Gibson
that Soeder. had frequently, visited him
at Â¦ theiOJlK. " salc^jjyon JParifie^,_strg$t,
an"dT same time ago' made-* htm a propo
sition to follow illsa Catharine Flat
ley and find out with whom she was
associating.
Soeder also asked Cannon to burn
down the residence at 200 Marshall
street, -where Miss Flatley resided with
her parents. Cannon further says that
Soeder offered him $10 a day for the
time he wa3 to spend In following Miss
Flatley and agreed to gix* him $300
when, he had set fire to and destroyed
her home.
OFFERED CAXXOX" 3IOXEY.
Soeder acted in a very cunning man
ner. He evaded the questions of Blaise
and sousht to gain information from
his visitor, even trying to speak to him
in German, which was not allowed by
Detective Gibson. Sc#<2er shelved no
emotion at meeting the man who may
be the brother cf the victim he is ac
cused of slaughtering like a sheep. All
he would say to Andrew Blaise was
that he was not guilty of the crime of
which he is accused.
The two men talked for more than an
hour, Andrew Blaise trying to find out
the names of the family into which
Soeder had married. Andrew Blaise
came originally from Welisottheim,
Germany, which is six miles from
Pfalsbourg, where Joseph Blaise re
sided.
Andrew Blaise left his home in Ger
many twenty years ago and has not
corresponded with his relatives for ten
years. Soeder denied at first that Jo
seph Blaise had any brothers, but
finally admitted that he did have one.

Evidence secured by the police tends to show that Leon Soeder was but one of a band
of conspirators in this city who sougfit to swindle insurance companies by foul murder of a
victim whose life had been heavily insured. *
The police are said to know of three men who were implicated in the plot that led to
the slaughter of Joseph Blaise on the night of Sunday, January 10, at the foot of Russian
HOI, and further arrests are expected at any time.
The men who are suspected of being accomplices of Soeder are known to the police.
They are thought to have supplied funds to him, and testimony is being sought to prove that
they forwarded money to Soeder in New York and Europe.

SAN JOSE. Jan. 17.â Rain began
falliner in. this city shortly before 9
o'clock this morning and during most
of the day, the fall being .67 of an Inch,
making 3.19 inches .for the season.
To-night it cleared and is quite cold
with the mountains surrounding, the
valley covered ;with snow. The wind
la still in the south with every indi
cation of more rain:
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 17.âRain,-ac
companied by the heaviest wind storm
in years, broke over this city at an
early hour this morning. The down
pour was the heaviest of the season,
and made miniature rivers of the gut
ters and lakes of the streets. .The
rain will prove ' greatly beneficial to
crops. It has been falling, almost all
day. and the precipitation has amount
ed to probably two. inches.. The sea
son's rainfall Is greatly In excess, of
that of the. previous-year at ' this date,
and should no \ more rain descend.
Sonoma County, is assured good crops.
s^:y jose is moistened.
In an interview to-night Weather
Observer J.' H. Scarr said the rainfall
in Sacramento to-day registered .22,
while the fall on Friday night was
.04. The total rainfall for the season,
to date has been 5.2, while* the nor
mal is 9.69, and the rainfall of last
season to an equal date was 6.71. â¢
"While the rainfall this year has
been considerably less than the nor
mal," said Observer Scarr, '.'neverthe
less it has been peculiarly favorable to
the farmers and orehardists. The rain,
has been so moderate as to allow the
farmers to go out into the fields and
do their plowing and seeding, whereas,
in other years, where the precipitation
has been much heavier, the ground
was in such a wet condition that the
farmers could not go out into the
ilelds with their plows. I do not think
the farming lands and orchards in the
great Sacramento Valley could be in
better condition than at present.
Plowing and seeding have been going
on continuously since the rains began
and the early sown grain is looking
splendid. The outlook among the
orehardists is also very bright. I have
received no reports to-day, this being
Sunday, from the other valley points,
but I am certain that this rainfall has
been general throughout the Sacra
mento Valley. The 'temperature to
night has dropped to .44 . degrees,
which indicates snow , in the moun
tains. The prospects are that there
will be still more rain in the valley
to-night or to-morrow, as the storm
conditions still prevail."'
to date is considerably below the aver
age, it has been s"o evenly distributed
as to enable the farmers to carry on
their operations- to the best advantage,
and from., every quarter of the great
valley come reports of rejoicing. The
miners had begun to fear there would
be a scarcity of snow on the moun
tains and consequent curtailment of
the water supply In the streams and
sluices next summer, but the latest re
ports from the mountains show that
snow I- falling and that the miners
are as well satisfied with th6 prospect
as the farmers In the valley. *
At this time last year there had been
over two .inches of rain, but the amount
later was slight and the year was as
good as some that the county has ex
perienced. To-night reports from all
over the county say that heavy rains
are falling and in the mountains there
is a fierce snowstorm. Seldom has
there. been greater rejoicing than there
Is to-night.
SATISFACTION IX SAX JOAQUIX.
STOCKTON,* Jan. 17:â Rain set in
here to-day Shortly before noon and
by nightfall something over half an
inch had 1 fallen. The fall is general
throughout San Joaquin County. Mois
ture was badly needed and the farm
ers had begun to fear a dry winter
Rain was needed not only in the high
lands, but on the reclaimed islands
also. The prospects are good for a
continuation of the rain to-night. The
storm is greatly appreciated by the
farmers and it .will do" much to stimu
late business activity in this vicinity
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.â The\trite
saying that ".the farmers '. are jubilant
never was more applicable than at pres
ent with respect . to the entire Sacra
mento Valley. Although the rainfall
Reports from Soledad and King City
and points lower down the Salinas Val
ley tell of a steady downpour, all day.
In the hill and grazing parts of the
county devoted to sheep and cattle
raising the present storm will be'.most
beneficial, as the early feed is about
exhausted and many of the cattle and
sheep men had commenced to move
their stock. If the present storm be
followed by moderate weather It can
not fail to relieve the situation in
Monterey County. The long continued
dry spell has wrought a general depres
sion in business which will be greatly
releived by the present generous rain.
The hills surrounding the Salinas Val
ley are capped with enow and It Is in
variably an Indication of more rain.
The present storm has greatly relieved
the situation in this county and with
moderate rains during the season
Monterey County will have fair crops.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 17.â The long
drought which has prevailed In Kern
County as well as in other parts of
the State throughout the entire sea
son was broken to-night bv a steady
downpour of rain starting about 5
o'clock and continuing for several hours,
with every prospect that it' will last
til! early morning. The morning was
very clear and at 11 o'clock the sun was
hot as a July day. About 2 o'clock it
clouded up and a nasty sandstorm set
in. Then it turned cold and the rain
started to come down hard. Up to this
evening only .24 of an inch had fallen
at Bakersfield during the season and
still less in other parts of the county.
The outlook was gloomy in the extreme,
the grass being altogether insufficient
to sustain cattle in the foothills and
valleys and but little better in the
mountains. No deaths have been re
ported from starvation, but the stock
has been kept up with clfflculty. The
usual shipments into the county from
New Mexico. Arizona, Western Texas
and Mexico hrve been greatly curtailed
so far this season.
SALIXAS VALLEY DAMP.
The present rain is general, and re
ports from all parts of the Salinas Val
ley tell of a steady fall. Up to the
present storm the total rainfall for the
season in the 'county had been but a
little over one inch. On the hills the
feed had ceased growing and plowing,
which c6mmenced some two months
ago in the valley, had stopped com
pletely owing to the dryness of the
ground. .While very late, the present
storm will do an immense amount of
good. Grain has not been sown to any
extent in any part of the county, and
a couple of Inches now. will result in
an immense acreage.
The present shower has been copious
enough to guarantee plenty of feed in
the immediate future. Grain land that
was planted months ago and had
given no promise of producing a crop
will, according to the farmers, show
the immediate effect of the storm.
There has been a heavy snowfall in
the mountains, assuring plenty of
water for irrigating ditches for several
months. If the present storm continues
for another twenty-four hours, as ap
pearances indicate it will, with the cer
tainty of late spring showers, Fresno
County is guaranteed another. yfar of
prosperity such as has just passed.
SALINAS, Jan. 17.â The rainfall of
the past ten hours has been worth hun
dreds of thousands of dollars to Mon
terey County. After a heavy south
wind, beginning about midnight, a
heavy rain started in this morning and
has continued the greater part of the
day. A brisk southerly wind is blowing
to-night, and with a low barometer in-*
dications point to a generous downpour
all night.
FRESNO, Jan. 17.â The long-looked
for rain has come at last, and since
noon Fresno has had a downpour of
over an inch. It is by odds the biggest
shower of the season, and has come
Just In time to save the crops and to
change to smiles the gloom on the faces
of the farmers and the cattlemen. Nev
er in many seasons had rain been so
badly needed in this section of the
State. Cattlemen and sheepmen have
been in despair, and the prices on cat
tle in the past week have been as low
as $6 per head and sheep as low as 50
cents per head because of the prospect
of drought. There was no feed any
where in the mountains.
nlghtis rain will be bf"great benefit to
stockmen in particular; Had the drought
continued through January hundreds
of cattle would have died, as feed was
getting very scarce. Agriculturists of
all classes have been waiting anxiously
fora break in the drought, bean farmers
especially being sufferers. If the rain
fall proves to be of" gtrodly quantities
incalculable benefit will be the result.
TULARE, Jan. 17.â There were heavy
showers all through the afternoon and
evening. The total rainfall for the
storm to the present time is .30 of an
inch and it is still raining. This means
much to the entire community, as feed
was becoming scarce and the wheat
was sufferins.
SANTA ANA, Jan. 17.â A gentle rain
with Intermittent' heavy showers com
menced falling here at 8 o'clock to
night. Previous rainfall for the season
was only .26 of an inch, so that this
is the first precipitation of importance
since last May. The rain will be wel
comed by all classes of farmers who
have deferred plowing and seeding for
weeks in anticipation of it. Lack of rain
has been especially severe on stockmen
and grain farmers. Horticulturists have
resorted to winter irrigation, extensively
in lieu of rain. .'.': Â¦â¢â¢'Â¦
GREAT HEJOICIXG IX FRESXO.
VENTURA. Jan. 17.â Rain com
menced fallfnsr this afternoon about 4
o'clock and the indications are for a
continuance of the .downpour during
the night The wind is southeast,
which if a very favorable indication.
There has been no rain since May after
last year. At this date last year the
preripi' -tion was nine inches. To-
nowxroun at vextura.
SANTA BARBARA. Jan. 17.â At 3
o'clock this afternoon rain began pour
ing here. After three hours of precipi
tation the streets of the city were
flooded. Early this morning a strong
wind tÂ»Â«t in from the southeast and
to-night the wind continues from the
pame direction, indicating a contin
uance of the storm. Reports Received
from outside stations of the. county re
port the storm quite general. There is
great rejoicing In the livestock districts,
as feed had grown so scarce that cat
tle were dying in large numbers. Stock
men were preparing to ship cattle to
Nevada, where feed Is more plentiful.
CAYL'COS, Jan. 17.â Sixty-hundredths
of an inch of rain has fallen here to
day and it. is still raining. The rain
breaks an unorecedented drought. This
town is the center of the great dairy in
terests of San Luis Obispo County,
which have suffered enormously
through a lack of feed and loss of
stock. The season is now half gone.
Stock is in r.oor condition. The quar
antine against the removal of stock on
account of the Texas tick has been
raised for twenty-five days for inspect
ed Ptoek. The time expires January 30,
but few are prepared to remove cattle.
Fortunately the rain has rendered this
unnecessary. Plowing and seeding have
been greatly delayed owing to the late
ness of the dairy season. Much grain
v.* ill now be sowed.
SAN LUIS OPISPO, Jan. 17.^Rain
commenced falling at noon to-day and
.75 of an inch fell during the afternoon.
The wind is south, with every indica
tion that the drought, which has lasted
Fince the summer, is broken. Previous
to the present rain .82 of an inch had
fallen for the season, in such widely
separated showers that little good re
sulted.
At 12 o'clock to-night the sky is per
fectly clear and the storm appears to
have spent itself.
SAN DIEGO. Jan. 17.â To-night the
sky was heavily clouded and at 10
o'clock slight rain began falling. It
Feems likely to develop into a heavy
downpour before morning. Rain is bad
ly needed in this county.
MOISTURE AT SAX LUIS.
,if the showers continue for a few
days and thoroughly soak the cracked
and parched earth the benefit to every
kind of business, agricultural and com
mercial alike, will be beyond calcula
tion.
The only rain that has fallen in
Los Angeles since last spring, almost
seven months ago, occurred on Sep
tember '21. when the precipitation
amounted to .43 of an inch. It came
too early to do any good and did ac
tual hurt to grapes, beans and other
fall gathered crojis.
Notwithstanding the long spell of
warm, dry weather there has been no
Hctua.1 suffering among and very little
loss of livestock in this immediate vi
cinity. Reports from other counties,
however, had begun to tell of a scar
city of feed and water and consequent
suffering of livestock and serious
losses to follow if rain did not come
to bring relief.
Farmers began to despair of crop
prospects. AH along the coast vegeta
tion had dried up except where there
>\ere facilities for irrigating. Very little
Brain has been sown owing to the con
dition of the earth. Some ranchers did
"dry plowing" and thus took chances
on the coming of rain to give life to the
grain in the ground. Citrus fruits have
not Euffered as much as other interests.
Oranges, however, are smaller than
usual owing to lack of moisture. To
night's rain will greatly benefit them.
VALUE OF THi: KAIX.
Beginning at Santa Barbara at 3
o'clock this afternoon, and traveling
rapidly alone: the coast line, the first
of the rainfall reached Los Angeles at
7 o'clock. For two days clouds have
drifted across the sky from west to
east, occasionally varying their course
from northwest to southwest. The
sun this morning was obscured by
lowering clouds, which a southeasterly
wind sent seaward. -At 2 p. m. the
sky cleared and it looked as if the
storm clouds, l'ke so many had done
before, had withheld their moisture
and passed away.
About 5 o'clock, however .the - low
lying gray clouds drifted landward
again. Weather sharps who have
passed through memorable Southern
California droughts cast weather eyes
skyward and ventured the statement
lh;tt the "rain surely is coming to
night." It did come to-night and* the
people of this part of the State were
so happy to see it that thousands who
were caiyrht out of doors gave no heed
to the \setting they got.
LOS AXGELES, Jan. 17.â Rainâ
the first in 117'daysâ is falling- over
Southern California- to-night. The
parched earth is drinking up in co
rious draughts the long expected and
anxiously awaited moisture that will
revivify the fast dying vegetation and
remove grave apprehension of a disas
trous drought.

Francis A. White, Wealthy Banker and
Speculator, Succumbs in This City.
Francis A. White of Everett, Wash.,
died in this city yesterday. Deceased
was born in Unadilla, Otsego County,
X. Y., July 19. 1S23. He was one of
the pioneers of Nebraska and the Cen
tral West, being one of the proprietors
and owners of the first stage line to
run between Omaha and Denver. Mr.
White was largely interested in rail
road construction and banking in the
Middle West. Later he removed . to
New York, becoming interested in the
New York, Rutland and Montreal
Railroad and the Toledo and Colum
bus Southern Railroad. He was one
of a party of passengers on the first
train to run from New York to Al
bany.
In 1876 he was one of the promoters
of the New York Consolidated Mining
Stock Exchange and was a successful
operator in Wall street. He was a
man of wide railroad experience and
knew intimately many great magnates,
among them J. J. Hill, upon whose ad
vice Mr. White went to Everett in
1891. He did not engage actively in
business, save for a brief management
of a bank he started in 1893. He was
instrumental in taking much capital
to Everett for investment and was well
posted on current affairs.
Deceased came to California on De
cember 12 in search of health and ex
pected to remain here until next June.
His only child, Creda E. White of
Fruitvale, Cal., was at his bedside
when he passed away.
Mr. White was a very wealthy man.

opened the door and found Horn dead
in bed. with the gas turned fully on.
The keyhole of the door had been
stuffed with paper. Horn had evident

removed to the Morgue.
As the man was unknown to Eberle
the police were notiflfd, and Detective
O'Dea was detailed on the case. The
only thing in the man's pockets was a
key marked Wilson House. O'Dea went
to the Wilson House, at 775 Mission

occupied the room to which the key be
longed for five or six weeks, leaving
on December 25. The only thing known
about Horn there was that he was in
the habit of hanging around a social

During 1903, thirty-five vessels were launched for the
British navy, with a collective displacement tonnage of
148,764 tons, 300,100 horsepower and representing a
cost when completed of $61,160 000. During 1902 only
fifteen vessels were launched, of 92.054 tons, 185,000
horsepower and finished cost of $34,059,000. For 1901
the total was 32 ships of 209,100 tons and aggregate
value of about $80,000,000. Private yards launched 31
vessels of 120,456 tons and 277,300 horsepower, repre
senting a value of $47,240,000 in 1903, leaving 4 ships
of 27.290 tons, 22,800 horsepower and completed value of
$13,920,000 to the dockyards.
Six cannon have mysteriously disappeared from the
grounds of the Rotunda on Woolwich Common and a
vigorous search of the police and military authorities has
failed to locate the stolen ordnance. The cannon were
of rare historical interest, the oldest being a faucon of
1661. of 2. 75-inch caliber, the others of-rvarylng dates, up
to 1776. It is surmised that the guns were stolen during
two successive nights; the theft was ridiculously easy, ad
hundreds of guns are left lying about the grounds far
from the patrol of the pickets. .and the i guns selected
were lightand could easily be carried by two men. They
were probably stolen orj-accounj. of -the bronze metal.
The German navy, estimates>ror 1904 vprovide'for an
increase of the personnel as follows: One vice admiral, 1
rear admiral, 3 captains, 14 commanders, 21 lieutenant
commanders, 15 lieutenants, 26 junior lieutenants and
59 midshipmen. The ensign list is reduced by 65, and the
increase of staff officers is 17 engineers and" 11 surgeons.
Warrant officers are increased by 117, petty officers 44
and men 1600. The German method of creating a navy
is intelligent and systematic. The programme of 1898
is followed out, ships are built within th6 designated
time and while the ships are under construction provision
is made for their officers and crew. Advances are made
with the requirements of a modern navy in the education
and status of the personnel, but no sudden, radical and
doubtful experiments are made. Individual desires of
officers at the expense and detriment of others are not
recognized; they are all â officers and men â constituent
parts of a great unit, the fighting navy, of Germany. A
great responsibility rests with our .Congress for having
neglected in the past to provide the requisite personnel
without which the ships are of no value. Its inaction in
this regard gives strength to the growing belief that the
building of ships without providing a personnel to officer
and man them has been rather for the purpose of keep
ing shipyards, and armor factories busy than creating a
national navy.-
There was a good production at the
Grand Opera-house yesterday after
noon and evening. "One- Night In June"
proved highly satisfactory to the audi
ence and encores were frequent. A
goodly crowd is assured for the bal
ance of the week.
â¢Much comedy intermingles itself with
the plot of the play and several new
features are introduced. All of the
songsters were worth the listening and
the actins was first class.
The play is well written and well act
ed. The characters are not overdone
except in the third act, and even tht
one lurid, impossible scene that is por
trayed is well acted. Guy Durrell in
the leading role played that part In un
usually good form, but the real star of
the cast is little Gussie Shires. Her act
ing was marvelous for a child of her
age. and it was she who won the
plaudits of the audience during every
act of the play.
The remainder of the company was in
keeping with the leading characters.
Mary K. Tajior in the role > of the
wronged wife acted her difficult part
with intense feeling. Robert Curtis and
Claire Grenville, the plotters, made a
strong pair of villains and caused the
gallery gods to emit showers of hisses
while they planned and executed their
treacherous work. Tony Asher as the
French butler and Dessie Ryan, who
plays the part of the cook, did the
comedy work in a clever manner. The
choir boy rendered one song during the
wedding scene that immediately took
with the audience.
Melodrama was inaugurated at the
California Theater last night, when
'"The Fatal Wedding" made its entry.
For a show of its kind and one with
such a suggestive title "The Fatal Wed
ding" was indeed a surprise, for instead
of being full of leaps for life and duels
to the death it contained numerous
touching and pathetic scenes, such as
bring tears to the eyes of the tender
hearted and lea vs. their effect even on
the blase. .**"Â¦'*.,
Stanley and Wilson do so well with
their musical comedy sketch, "Before
the Ball,' that the masculine half of
the team is compelled to speak his
thanks. Miss Wilson sings "Anona"
with a swing and vocal strength that
even Mabel McKinley did not equal,
although the favorite niece of the late
President may have displayed more
artistry in her execution.
White and Simmons present another
antiquated negro absurdity that keeps
the house in a roar. Howard Thurs
ton's stagey legerdemain does not seem
to lose favor with repetition. Wallno
and Marinette continue to illustrate
the poetry of motion, and Juggler Asra
and the biograph round out the attrac
tive bill. ; ,
The proclaimed headliners are a
group of acrobats programmed as the
Stein Eretto family, and their specialty
is hand-jumping. .They do things of
that kind so much better than any pre
ceding performers of their class as to
make their work almost original and
entirely interesting. The "kid" of the
family, a 5-year-old, is the cleverest lit

Irving Jones, a colored gentleman
who writes his own songs, unrolls a
budget of his latest melodies and keeps
his hearers in excellent humor. His
singing of "St. Patrick's Day is a Bad
Day for Coons" would provoke guffaws
from a misanthrope.
Kelly and Violette are not given
headline prominence on the new Or
pheum bill, but they were received In a
way yesterday afternoon that clearly
proved them first in the favoritism of
the audience. The fact y that they are
San Francisco products may have had
something to do with the heartiness of
the greeting and the loudness of the re
call that rewarded their every song, but
with local predilection removed they
would have "made good" just the same.

and, strange to relate, she seems to bo

appeals to the ear, so the combination
is harmonious. Y?,~.
"The Fatal Wedding" Scores a
Hit-"0nc Night in June"
Wins Approval at the Grand
The Secretary of the Navy Indorses Senator Frye's bill
which favors the employment of American vessels for
public purposes. Under the present law of 1846, trans
portation of naval supplies must be furnished by contract
by the lowest bidder, and as a consequence this business
has practically fallen entirely into the hands of foreign
ship owners. During the past fiscal year 3930 tons of
stores were shipped to foreign ports for use of United
States naval- vessels, of which 2179 tons were carried by
English bottoms. 1301 tons by Germans, 373 tons in
American vessels and 77 tons in French bottoms. Of
54.373 tons of coal shipped to Cavite and Yokohama,
49,373 tons were carried by English vessels and 5000 tons
by vessels under the German flag. There are seventeen
American steamers of 145.512 tons on the Pacific Coast,
all of which are suitable for transportation purposes and
to which preference should be given even if the cost
is slightly increased.
Three officers of the United States navy â Lieutenant
Commander W. S. Sims, Surgeon H. G. Beyer and Civil
Engineer R. E. Peary â have returned from England,
where they were sent to inspect the system of shore bar
racks in the Royal navy. They found the disciplinary
methods much less severe in the British than in the
American navy, and Rear Admiral H. C. Taylor, chief of
the Bureau of Navigation, realizes that our methods are
conducive to dissatisfaction among and desertion by
enlisted men. In the British navy, if a man returns to
his station fn a quiet manner, but half seas over, he is
taken care of by an orderly and put in his bunk. If he
turns out in the morning able to perform his duty he
receives no punishment whatever. If he returns to his
station after hours and is still orderly his only punish
ment is that of being obliged to sleep on a bench at the
gatehouse. British officers make due allowance for the
frailty of intoxication, being convinced that it cannot
be stopped. In the American navy the regulations of
1900 limits the punishment for drunkenness to confine
ment for six months, but as a rule it consists of confine
ment for a short time, reduction in class and deprivation
of liberty. In the Royal navy overstaying of liberty is
no longer punished by restriction of liberty, and forfeit
ure of pay is now the penalty. In our navy the offender
may be punished by confinement for six months and dis
honorable discharge. Rear Admiral Taylor is studying
the problem and will no doubt recommend the abolition
of restricted liberty, which drives more men out of the
navy than all other causes objectionable to the enlisted
personnel.
Of ten candidates examined for appointment as as
sistant civil service engineers iri^the United States navy,
only two were found professionally and physically qual
ified. Of twenty-five applicants for commissions as
second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, nine were found
physically disqualified.
The Commonwealth of Australia agreed on August 28
last year to contribute $968,050 to the British navy
toward maintaining the auxiliary squadron in Federal
waters, and the Treasurer of the six Australian States
has forwarded the first annual payment, toward which
New South Wales contributed $438,425, Victoria $212,000.
Queensland $90,490, South Australia 5114,460, Western
Australia 567,320 and Tasmania $55,255.
The ajrnored cruiser Suffolk. 9S00 tons, 22,000 horse
power and calculated speed of 23 knots, was launched
January 14, 1903, and made her speed trials last month
with marked success. The eight hours' full^power de
veloped 22.645 horsepower and 24.7 knots with 139.3 rev
olutions and a conl co:isumption of 2.2 pounds per unit
of horsepower. The speed wat taken by log and is
therefore not to be considered as\iccurate as a measured
mile distance, but the Suffolk is unquestionably the fastest
of the ten ships of that class built and tried since 1902.
The recent speed and power trials of the British arm
ored cruiser Cumberland, of 9800 tons, furnishes some
interesting data showing the increase of power and con
sequent additional coal consumption required to raise
the speed. The ships under one-fifth power developed
4 913 horsepower, giving a speed of 15,241 knots on a coal
consumption* of 110 tons for 24 hours. With eight
elevenths power the horsepower was 1C452, speed 22, 13S
knots and coal to ihe amount of 350 tons .per 24 hours
was consumed. ThÂ«Â» eight- hours' full power trial, gave
22,769 horsepower. 23.7 knots' speed and the coal con
sumption rose to 490 tons per 24 noun?. It Will be noted
that in order to increase the speed by a little over 50
per cer.t required a coal consumption of over 400 per cent
greater. As the Syren a.-d Shipping states it, "'it is the
last, and not the first, knot which costs, and it is small
wonder that the speed problems which the Cunard Com
pany have to face in their projected high-speed leviathans
are causing much study and very considerable anxiety.
The British Admiralty has revised the regulations for
the retirement of officers, by an order issued December 13
last vear, but which is retroactive and went into effect
from* July 1, 1903. Admirals of the fleets must retire on
attaining the age of 70; admirals^ and vice admirals at
â¬5; rear admirals at 60; captains at 55; commanders at
50 and lieutenants at 45 years of age. Continuous shore
service is limited to five years, except in the departments
of the admiralty, where seven years are allowed. Com
pulsory retirement is required from admirals and vice
admirals who have not hoisted their flags for five years
and rear admirals must retire after a lapse of three and
one-half years' inactivity. Captains, commanders and
lieutenants to retire after the three years' period since
last at sea has elapsed. A gradual increase of flag rank
officers is provided for to be completed by 1907, when
there will be 3 admirals of the fleet, 12 admirals, 22 vice

DEATH'S HAND
IS LAID UPON
CHARLES DOE
J. S. Doe died many years ago. and
the firm was then reorganized under
the name of C. F. Doe & Co. C. F. Doe
was made president and his brother,
Bartlett Doe, retained an interest.
Frank P. Doe, a nephew, was also
taken into the firm with his two uncles.
The company did a thriving business
in its lir.e and was one of the leading
lumber dealing and door and sash man
ufacturing concerns in the State.
Charles F. Doe was also interested in
ether pursuits, and at the time of his
death was president of the California
Door Company. He also had extensive
lumber and land interests all over the
State and owned valuable property in
this city. He was a part owner of the
Et. Nicholas Hotel property, at the
junction of Hayes and Liarket streets.
C. F. Doe never married. He always
led a Quiet life and did not mingle with
the social set orÂ« take active part in
politics or fraternal affairs. He was
known as a man of shrewd business in
telligence and frugal habits.
The deceased is survived by several
nieces and nephews, who are scattered
all over the United States. His fortune
is estimated to be worth between 52,-
O00.OQ0 and $3,000,000, which in all proba
bility will go to his nieces and nephews.
His nephew, Frank P. Doe, was averse
to discussing the financial affairs of his
late uncle, but it is understood that the
dead man left a will and that all his
holdings and securities axe amply pro
tected against any possible lawsuits

ments have as yet. been made for the
funeral. The Coroner's office was noti

never interfered with the performance
of his duties in his office for the last
twelve years. He had arisen a few
minutes before his lifeless body was
discovered and taken his morning bath,

tered his room preparatory to dressing
himself, and evidently expired without

Suits to Measure for $ 10
Visit our tailoring department and look over our swell ;
patterns. Either pick out a piece of goods costing the same
price as you generally pay or select a material at about one-
third lower in price.
"If you get a suit at the same price you have always
paid you will get garments that will outwear any other suit
you ever had at the price. If you select a suit costing one- I
third less than you customarily pay you will find that it will
wear as well as your other suits, for which you paid higher
prices. j
I We make suits to order for as low as it is safe for cus-
tomers to buy, up to as much as most men care to pay. i
We make an all-wool suit to order for $10.00 and guar- '

Raabe was arrested last Wednesday
night in a saloon at Sixteenth and
Canp streets by Detectives Fitzgerald
and Graham and Policeman M.
Oooney. He is a son of Fred Raabe,
the -well-known politician, who at. the
present, time holds a political position
in Sacramento. The police say that
the boy has never been in serious
trouble before. His two companions
are known and their arrest is only a
question o? time.
Cerf was on his way home about 9
o'clock and at Post and Franklin
streets three youths surrounded him
and ordered him to throw up his hands.
One had a revolver. This one Cerf
identified as Raabe. Cerf was told to
hand out his money and he gave up
60 cents. One of the young footpads
threw back Cerf's coat and relieved
him of his watch arid chain and a $5
gold piece. Just then a man came
along and Cerf was told not to make
an outcry or his head would be blown
off. After the man had passed them
Cerf was allowed to go.
About an hour after the Cerf hold
up Frank Heissner, who was on his
way to call upon his mother-in-law at
375 Fell street, was held up by three
youths at Octavia and Fell streets.-
They at first asked him for a match,
and then told him they were not after
match, but money. They took $3 in
silver from him, and one, who held a
revolver, threatened to blow his head
off if he did not keep quiet. As they
were leaving him the one with the re
volver struck him on the head with
the butt end of the weapon, knocking
him down. He had a look at Raabe in
the prison yesterday, but although he
said Raabe answered the description of
the one with the revolver he would, not
positively identify him.
Fred Raabe, 19 years of age, was
positively identified at the City Prison
yesterday afternoon by Eugene C.
Cerf of 1155 Octavla street as one of
three' youths â¢ who' held' him up and
robbed him at 'Post and Franklin
streets on Sunday night, January 10.
Cerf promptly picked Raabe out from
four other boys about his own age.
Raabe's mouth twitched and he nearly
collapsed. He was booked on a charge
of robbery.
The Rev. Mr. Pearse will speak at
Grace M. E. Church to-night on "Some
Old Folks at Home."
Werj I to EUffer as some I have seen I would
myself have a tense of wrath, of indignation;
I would grow bitter against the world. That
volcano will burpt unless the churches change
the conditions. Socialism, as it is mostly un

ism means what is thine Is mine, but Social
ism too pa># what is mine is thine. Ah, that
is the socialism we want In the world â un

that Ehall transform the social conditions in
which men ehall live.
I would thct the millionaire*, the rich roen
of our church, would endow their daughters
with enouch money to carry on the work of
the Sisters of the People. In that respect we
m'frht well follow the example of our friends
of the Roman Catholic church. I do not mean
the practice of celibacy, but that the young
daughters of the wealthy might give up their
time to the philanthropic work, the assistance
and attendance on the poor and the elek.
I should say. were I the working: man, if
you want me in church, why not want me as

"The churches as a rule cannot do as
much as probably we expect they

"Year by year, boys and girls are
growing up, magnificent specimens of
intellectual and physical development.
Our girls, good, pure, trustful, truthful
and beautiful. But how much better
would be that development if as much
were given to the spiritual side as to
the physical and the intellectual. Give
the spiritual side its just place. We
can respect. all forms of. religion.. Man
should worship God as he pleases. It
makes no difference what is that belief.
"Man is composed of three distinct ele

That which has be_en given to us should

us be clean muscled and strong of

But we are not fully formed unless in
our hearts there is a love and respect
for our religion, no matter what it Is.
"You must have remarked in this city
a lack of reverence for God. It is here,
it is elsewhere, and it is the crying dis
ease of society. We build buildings to
last forever. We pay much attention
to our temporal concerns. We are filled
with pride over our prosperity and the
success of our people. But morality
or religion, call it what you will, must
be at the foundation.
"The cause of this disease is an apost
acy from God. It is impossible to build
up character without God. You cannot,
positively and absolutely, cannot do it.
The experience of . centuries tells U3
that. The greatest crime of the present
day is the putting away of God.

Is the boy and the girl to be taught
that love for religion that makes for

law rules there shall be no religion

"A man's life in society is not lived
to himself or for himself. Whether he
wills it or not, he must be a factor for
good or for evil. You cannot be in
different. There must be an active co
operation, else you are an element of
positive evil. If you are interested in
unlifting all that is in your power, then
you are a positive good.
"In Oakland we have much to be
thankful for. Our city is blessed by
nature as few cities are. The adminis
tration of our laws is good. Our offi
cials who guide the city and direct -it
are honest and efficient. But we, as
citizens, are not an exception to the
one great fault of the day, our failure
to give to the religious, the spiritual
side, a proper: prominence.
"The subject of good citizenship is
one of the greatest in the world. It is
an encyclopedia, for it takes in so
much. A good citizen js the one who
loves his country and is obedient to the
law. There is a two-fold obligation in
this â one each on the part of the city
and of the citizen. The citizen must
give obedience and respect to the law
and the city must give care and pro
tection to the citizen. When this two
fold obligation is observed things go
along well. Then the balance is struck
as between them.
Thus did the Rev. Thomas Mc-
Sweeney, pastor of St. Francis de Sales
Church, declare during an address on
"Good Citizenship," delivered this aft
ernoon at the men's meeting of the
Young . Men's Christian Association.
The eloquent priest was given closest
attention, and his story, virile words
for the unbuilding of the moral side
of mankind, were heard by an audi
ence which made much approving re
sponse.
D. Edward Collins, president of the
Young Men's Christian Association, in
troduced Father McSweeney, who ex
pressed his strong approval of the asso
ciation's work, with large meed of
praise for the men who were carrying

OAKLAND. Jan. 17.â "The lack of
reverence for God, the lack of faith, the
absence of religion in the hearts of
menâ that is the crying disease of so
ciety at the present time, here in Oak

The cause of this disease is apostacy
from God. It is the greatest crime of

The action of the Rev. Mr. Work
was not unexpected, as the illness of
his young son was known to be a bar
*o continue residence in California. He
took his son to Southern California
three weeks ago and at that time it
was rumored that he would resign.
Since then the condition of the child
has become so alarming that the fam
ily physician ordered him taken to Col
orado Springs and this hastened the
father's resignation. Fortunately for
the Rev. Mr. Work he has received and
accepted a call to the First Presbyte
rian Church of Colorado Springs," 30
that the family may take up its resi
dence, there and be equipped for caring
for the child invalid. ' -

Although more than 200 houses were
built in Fruitvale during the year 1903,
the demand is still far in excess of the
supply and many people who wish to
locate in that section are compelled to
go elsewhere because it is impossible
to secure homes. The Syndicate In
vestment Company has built a large
number of houses and cottages and has
disposed of them as fast as they were
finished. The Sather tract, which was
placed on the market Ly the company,
is practically sold out. and as soon as
the rainy season is over more than
thirty cottages and hou-es will be
erected by the owners of the lets.
Real estate dealers throughout the
entire county report a larger number
of inquiries for all kinds of property
than ever before at this time of the
year, and they are confident that fully
as much if not more bur ness will be
done in 1904 than was done during 1903.
Another Important transat.on in the
same section of the city was the sale
of the Jucson Davis property on the
corner of Twenty-second street and
Broadway. The price paid was $9000.

Chris Bader, a San Francisco cabinet
maker, who lives on Washington street
in Fruitvale, was beaten by a footpad
to-night when within a few blocks of
his home because the footpad thought
that Bader was gojng to draw a re
volver. Then Bader was beaten a sec
ond time because the footpad found
that he had little money with him.
The assault took place in a very dark
portion of Fruitvale, just outside of the
city limits of Oakland on East Four
teenth street, near Twenty-seventh
avenue. Bader was on his way home
vhen a masked man stepped from be
hind a tree and ordered him to throw
up his hands. Bader had his hands m
his overcoat pockets at the time and
did not withdraw them quickly enough
to suit the highwayman, who thought
that he was going to draw a revolver.
He forestalled any act of that kind by
hitting Bader on the head with a club
and knocking him down. Then he went
through Eader's pockets and when he
found but little money he vented his
anger upon the unfortunate victim by
beating him ftill more with the club.
Bader is badly cut on the head. The
highwayman has escaped. There is no
police system in the portion of Fruit
vale where the crime occurred, it being
outside of the city limits of Oakland.

W. V. Stafford, who for ten years
has been the chairman of the general
grievance committee of division 264 of
the Order of Railway Conductors, was
to-night presented with a handsome \
silver table service by members of the
Order in recognition of the years of
hard work he has done for the order.
The presentation was a complete sur
price to Stafford. A committee from
the local division, headed by L. L.
Stevens, called upon Mr. Stafford at
his home, 914 Market street, to-night,
and Mr. Stevens presented the service
with a very neat littl speech, in which
he thanked Mr. Stafford for his earnest
and successful work for the order.
There were addresses by others, in
cluding Joe Moffitt and Charles H.
Schu.
Mr. Stafford, in his capacity as chair
man of the general grievance commit
tee, has had to handle all of the nego
tiations between the order and the
officials of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and the long term of peace be
tween the railroad managers and the
conductors has been largely due to his
careful management and diplomacy.
The tact and ability of Mr. Stafford
has been recognized by the members
of the order, and they took this meth
od of making known their regard for
both the man and his work.
The service is very handsome, and
comprises everything in the shape of
tableware that can be made out of
silver.

The police would be glad to know
the whereabouts of Edgar Brown, erst
while Justice of -the Peace for Salmon
Falls Township, El . Dorado County,
more recently a resident of Berkeley
and still later, , to all .appearances, a
dealer in groceries at 1731. Market
street, San Francisco.
If the former Justice be located he
might explain why a browm leather
valise packed with his belongings and
one .black soft hat of stylish make
were mysteriously left 'in the rear of
1355 Webster street.
The valise was found by a gardener,
where it lay in a back yard, as if hast
ily thrown there. Detective Shorey re
covered the hat in an adjoining yard
several days ago, but no attention was
given the find. until to-day's package
was brought to light.
None of the residents in the neigh
borhood know Justice Brown, nor can
they throw any light upon the valise or
the hat. In the receptacle are a lot of
papers.. letters and the like, with ssev
eral articles of clothing. The contents
were neatly packed, as if the owner
were on a journey with them.
Examination of the documents dis
closed Justice Brown's name on a cer
tificate of election dated November 6,
1894. Other papers indicated that he
had resided in Folsom, had been fore
man of a vineyard in that locality and
had been in the grocery business in^
San Francisco. Detective Shorey has
no theories concerning the mystery, so
he has carefully laid aside, the hat and
valise, hoping that the apparent owner
will appear, claim his property and
make explanations.

Mrs. Little is the mother of Miss
Carolyn Little, who has just returned
from Europe, and who promises to suc
ceed her mother as one of California's
leading sopranos.
For the Christmas services at the
First Presbyterian Church, Oakland, a
splendid programme of music had been
prepared, including a soprano solo.
"Rejoice Greatly." from Handel's "Mes
siah." Christmas,- eve the leading so
prano. Mrs. Carrie Brown Dexter, con
tracted a severe cold, which effectually
prevented her from doing any solo
work. In despair she called on Mrs.
Little, to whom the intricacies of the
well-known hymn were once child's
play, and the now white-haired singer
consented to appear before her loved
public once more. That Christmas day
will long be remembered by those who
attended the morning services at the
First Presbyterian Church.
A little nervous, perhaps, at her own
daring, the sweet voice wavered a lit
tle at first and time's scars were per
ceptible on a few lower notes. But as
she warmed to her work and the .old
surroundings became familiar once
more, the singer forgot her- sixty-one
years and. gave the difficult passages
of the famous song with such unex
pected art and strength and feeling
that the congregation almost' broke
into applause.
With two living examples of such
wonderful voice ,, .preservation right
here, it is not' surprising that some
people expected more from the once
Incomparable queen -f song, Adelina
Patti! :w^..:--'vl- . â¢ '-' - -. '. . N - -â¢ ;
Mrs. Little was a society leader here,
as well as the most prominent singer
of her day. and her fine old home out
on T oadvvay has been the rendezvous
ol many well-known people of the so
cial, musical and literary world.
While the masses are still marveling
over ' the wonderful preservation of
Patti's voice, it is appropriate that at
tention should be called to two Califor
nia women whose beautiful t.nes have
withstood the blighting hand of Time â
Mrs. Blake-AIverson and Mrs. William
C. Little, both now resident of Oak
land. Both of these well-known musi
cians have recently been heard once
more in public and their praises have
since been resounding on ail sides.
Mrs. Blake-AIverson was at one time
California's foremost- contralto and
many, many times has her voice been
raised, freely and generously, in behalf
of charity. Her husband being a prom
inent Mason, she was an active partic
ipant in all the public exercises of that
order. So, when Lyon Corps. G. A. R.
of Oakland celebrated its twenty-fifth
anniversary a few weeks ago the ven
erable lady was asked to sing for the
sake of "auld lang syne." Bowed as
she is â¢ by the weight of 6S years and
crippled as the result of an accident,
little was expected cf her. but the invi
tation was extended as a mark of cour
tesy and deep respect. When the still
full, sweet voice swept out over the
crowd, however, in the trying strains
of "The Star Spangled Banner," old
soldiers forget their years and their
veins tingled once more with the fire
and patriotism of youth. Age had ma
tured the voice they heard, but Time's
chill hand had passed lightlr over the
warm, rich tones that still thrilled
with the power to stir human hearts.
The high notes lacked n !iing, either
of strength or sweetness. The buoy
ancy and power of Mrs. Alverson's
.voice is all the more remarkable when
one considers that she has been teach
ing for the last forty years.
Mrs. Little is proud of the fact that,
like Patti. sixty-one years have passed
her gently by and that she is still able
to give pleasure with the voice that
was once a pure delight. She came to
California in 1&>9 and almost immedi
ately took her place with t prominent
singers of the coast. Lhe as at differ
ent times leading soprano of Calvary,
the Unitarian and other large churches
fn San Francisco. For years she was
closely identified with the old Presby
terian church on Harrison street . i Oak
land, and she started the fund for the
organ which now graces the new edifice
on the corner of Fourteenth and
Franklin streets.

From Del Norte to the bending bay
of San Diego and from the Sierras to
the sea the all-absorbing topic in club
dom is "The Federation." Now, this
particular federation is of quite as
much im;K>nance to the women folk as
the St. Louis convention is to their
husbands; and all because at this gath
ering will be chosen the delegates from
California to rtroceed to the great bien
nial convention to be held at the expo
sition at St. Louis. Now, there's a con
vention worth attending, for betwixt
tirr.es the fair grounds may be visited
and delightful tete-a-tetes be held with
the cleverest clubwomen in the country
âfor the Woman's Building is always
â¢the rcecca cf all good clubwomen.
At the exposition at Buffalo the
Woman's Building as an exhibition hall
Â¦was omitted in the architectural plan,
but a woman's clubhouse was fitted up
in the best part of the grounds, remote
from the hubbub of the midwayâ which
was the rnadrib cf the fairâ but near
enough to It to be convenient for little
sallies thither and back. And so will
the plans bÂ» at St. Louis.
Now, at Sacramento there's going to
be some nigh bidding: for the honors of
delegates. Speculation is rife here, in
Oakland and in Los Angeles as to the
prospective candidates. From San
Francisco many lists are being pre
pared and. as the racing men say, it's
Â«=ven money who will win the honors.
Leading the various premature ballots
in this city are Mrs. George Law Smith,
Mrs. Arthur W. Cornwall. Mrs. L. L.
Dunbar. Mrs. George Haight. Mrs. John
F. Swift. Mrs. Henry Payot, Mrs. J.
"\V. Orr, Mrs. C. Mason Kinne and Mrs.
Ella. Sexton. Besides there are a few
ethers who, though what might be
termed dark horses, seem to stand a
very fair chance when the balloting is
on. It is. however, rather generally
conceded that either Mrs. George Law
Smith or Mrs. Arthur W. Cornwall will
be among those who represent this
city â perhaps both of them.
As to whom the presidency Â«f the
California Federation will go, that
cems to be in the hands of the present
*f5cient officer. Mrs. L. F. Darling.
Should she decline the honor, however,
it is thought that Mrs. J. E. Cowles
from the south would be an acceptable
candidate, as her efficiency and per
s" nal charm won the admiration of
hosts cf women who attended the bien
r.:al convention at Los Angeles.
â¢Australian ballot system?" Well.
even if that system isn't in vogue
there'll be a slim chance for "stuffing:"
or otherwise thwarting the will of the
women in that convention. They will
keep a commendable supervision, rest
assured, on that "bulwark cf American
literty," the ballot boxâ a habit that
might with Â¦ compunction be recom
mended to the men folk in weightier
.matters. However, these domestic poli
tics make capital training for women
in the duties of the ballot that are
comingâ the coming may be slow, but
all- social and domestic problems are
slow of solution, and the ballot will
come naturally to her who waits, if she
dcesn't have the execrable taste to die
prematurely.
Firemen Imperiled In Chicago Fire.
CHICAGO,- Jan. 17. â Fire in the
Chicago Consolidated Milling and
Malting Company's plant , to-day
caused a loss of 975,000. Eight fire
men lost their/wray In the smoke. Two
of them were : rendered unconscious
and the rest had nearly succumbed
when other firemen cut a hole through
the roof and rescued them.
A gigantic effort is about to be made
by the State Committee of Women on
the Vallejo Naval Clubhouse for the
purpose of carrying to completion their
most excellent plans. The clubhouse
is a thing of reality, the roof is on it.
What a splendid thing it is that club
tea is such harmless stuff: It's good,
and It doesn't leave a headache in the

Vocal music. Miss Alma Hansen, Miss
A. MacDonald. Miss lone Pennlngton.
Miss Alice Bush. The singers were
accompanied by Miss Ethelwynne Mar

in that capacity at many of its affairs.
After an instrumental solo by Miss

The Laurel Hill Club meets on Jan
uary 20 at the Sorosis Club rooms, when
the following programme will be pre
sented:
The third large club that moves along
the 5ame political (as opposed to cul
tural) lir.es is the Political Study Club,
of which Mrs. A. M. Calkins, a prom
inent society woman, is president.
Distinctly it is now good form in
Gotham to be a supporter of suffrage
and a political student.
In New York women's political clubs
thrive wonderfully, where they discuss
everything from the science of politics
â as practiced in Gotham â to the great
questions of political and social econ
omy. And the members of these clubs
are drawn from the ultra-smart set,
for note Mrs. Robert Abbe of 13 West
Fiftieth street entertaining the City
History Club at her fashionable home,
where civic questions were handled
bravely, y*Â»s. and cleverly.
Then there is the Women's Republi
can Club that met last week in Del
monico's for its annual election, where
scores of private carriages were drawn
up awaiting the fair politicians-in
theory- Allan Robinson, well known
as an authority on the great political
subjects of the day. addressed the la
dies upon '"Restriction of Immigra
tion."
As to the statue of Junipero Serra. it
is an interesting fact that last year a
joint committee of the Califi.raia Pro
rnction Committee and of the Califor
nia Landmarks League had that very
matter under discussion (in conjunction
with the placing of bronze tablets on
historic buildings in San Francisco).
.And strong influence - as brought to
bear to obtain some surrl" f un> s from
the Board of Supervisors to assist in
the work, but the funds were found un
available, and the league was forced to
drop the matter temporarily.
So it is with deep rejoicinp that the
project has taken on new life.
Is tliere any community in the coun
try â save our own â that would iiave
; permitted a spot of sacred memory like
our century-old Mission to be neglected
! and unkempt as v.e have done? To be
sure within the last half-year the in
terior has been partly restored â the al
tar marveiously well done. But what
of the churchyard that lies ir. its shad
ow? Is it not sad in its Â«"^plorab!e de
cay? Could not the Outdoor Art
League secure permisr n to restore to
a semblance of decency this aged God's
acre? There are many who wou.d help.
Ladies, if you are short on suggestions,
here's one.
This, the first public recognition of
this pioneer of pioneers, emanates
from James D. Phelan, who has offered
to erect a statue in a suitable spot, and
that it will be artistically worthy is
well assured, since Mr. Phelan is him
self an authority in matters relating to
art.
Mrs. Lovell White. Mrs. E. Glaser
and Mrs. Luther Wagoner â¢have laid
the plans of â¢ their body before the
Board of Public Works, and it is to be
hoped that results will com of their
presentation.
The Outdoor Art League :â¢ actively
canvassing the matter of improving
the landscape in the vicinity of the
Mission Doloresâ a splendid project and
worthy of results. Trees are to be
planted along Dolores street, from
Fifteenth and Seventeenth, and along
Sixteenth street from Dolores to
Chur-Ii. There is also a plan afoot to
lay out a Eir-al! parkâ parklet. perhaps,
would be a better wordâ in the middle
of Dolares street, and in one of these
is to be placed the proposed statue of
Junipero Serra, the great Father of
the West.
Of the many cultural clubs In this
city, the Mills Club is one of the clev
erest. Its programme, always full of
merit, was especially rood on Tuesday
last, when the following entertainment
was offered: '
Piano recital. Miss Amy Seller, as
sisted by Mrs. James F. McGauley,

James F. McGauley; etudes sympho
niques. op. 13 (Schumann): polonaise.
A flat. cp. 53 (Chopin): (a) Dance of

The California Historic Landmarks
League will mÂ°et at Hopkins Institute
of Art on Wednesday evening, to
which all that are interested in the
restoration of the Missions â and San
Antonio in particularâ are invited.
Reports will be made on the work
already accomplished in the beautiful
old sanctuary.
The Rev. Father CrVarley will give
an address on "The Boys' Farm at
Rutherford." which enterprise prom
ises to help mightily in solving some
knotty economic questions.
Miss Mary Patton, lately returned
from the Continent, "will talk upon
"Hospitals in Europe."
Mrs. Mary Hart, the founder of the
"Northern Lights Club" (I'm giving
the translated name out of compassion
for the compositor), will tell how she
succeeded in coming away from Nome
Â¦with so many gold nuggets; -besides,
she has many things to say that are
not commercialâ and she knows how
to say them.
And there will be â owing to a request
from the landmarks committee of the
federation â a little talk about the Ca
huenga treaty, whose anniversary is
near at hand. Modesty â ahem! â pre
vents me from stating what a "nice"
talk that will be! It will at least have
the merit of brevity.* And I am glad
I can report to myself. All duties car
ry their compensations.
The California Club will offer a va
ried programme to-morrow. The day
is under the direction of the social sci
ence section, Mrs. Jacob Brandt chair
man.
It seems to have given the Board of
Education something of a shock to
discover the * condition of parental
misrule in trie Latin quarter. That
scores of little tykes of school age are
peddling limes and matches and little
girls doing household drudgery has
been known to interested observers for
some time. Judge Murasky and Miss
Stebbins, if consulted, could throw
much light upon (he subject; -very few
of the little sinners who come before
them can read or write, which accom
plishments are looked upon by the lit
tle foreigners as vague luxuries, fit
only for "rich" boys.
By the way, where will the children
rounded up by Truant Officer Floyd be
placed? The schools in the Italian
quarter are already overflowing-. The
demand for portable schoolhouses is
infinitely more urgent in this foreign
quarter than in the districts where
children have the advantages of home
training and discipline. This is the
urgent appeal of the civic section of
the California Club, and it is earnestly
to be hoped that the Board of Educa
tion will waste no time instituting an
"official" investigation. A day or two
climbing around the cul-de-sacs that
thread the Hill will convince the most
obtuse observer of two things â the ne
cessity of enforcing the compulsory
education law there and the urgent
necessity for more school accommoda
tions in this new Italy.
The Pioneer Daughters meet to-day
in the parlors. Pioneer building, where
they will entertain their friends in
their usually interesting manner. Miss
Lucy Adams will preside.
Herewith ia a story of the work of
good womenâ those who guide the des
tinies of the Children's Hospital and
Training School for Nurses. The
amount of work done by the board of
managers and the other officers is
phenomenal, not the least of which is
â¢"making both ends meet." The fol
lowing managers were elected to serve
for the coming year:
Mrs. W. B. Harrington, Mrs. William
Hardy. Mrs. John F. Merrill, Mrs. L.
L. Dunbar, Mrs. J. H. Dickinson, Mrs.

W. J. Dutton, Leon Sloss, James D.
Phelan and Rolla V. Watt.
Fifty thousand dollars was the .total
cost of building and equipping the
structure, and of this sum but $10,000
has been subscribed. Now comes a sug
gestionâand a capital one â from the
"Jackies". themselves, that they give an
entertainment to help raise funds. Now
that would be a real novelty? and let
us wish the plucky naval lads success.
Take a ticket? Why, of course, for
Uncle Samuel's fighting lads. Who
wouldn't? Mrs. McCalla, Mrs. Freder
ick Sanborn, Afrs. Merrill and* many
other good women are lying â¢ awake
nights devising schmes to make dol
lars â and the law discountenances
counterfeiting. So we club women
must help them.
and the appreciative "jackies" may go
through it at will and see what these
good women are trying to do for their
comfort and moral welfare.

Dave, the Fire Dog.
In a Western Addition engine house
there is a doc' named Dave who pos
sesses rare intelligence. Dave knows
the taps on the fire gong as well as
the men attached to the company. As
soon as the first tap is sounded on the
alarm gong he will listen until the sec
ond round comes in. If the box is one
to which the engines respond he will
jump about while the horses are' being
hitched, whining a cry of delight at the
expected joy of a run. Should the box
be fc-r.an outside section he will throw
himself on the mat and blink into a
slumber w-ith an v air. of: "Oh, pshaw-;
nothing in it for me."
Dave, was raised in the engine house
from puppyhood. So well trained is he
and possessed of such a natural gift of
intelligence that during the night time
when' the watchman Is on duty he will
make a round of the house every hour.

THE State of New York, in obedience to an impera
tive public necessity, a few years ago embarked
upon the conservation of remaining forests.
Farmers complained of increasing aridity of the soil and
decline in its fertility. Streams once of full and constant
flow, and furnishing valuable water-power.Nvere dry half
the year. The headwaters of the Mohawk, the Hudson,
the. Susquehanna and the" -Delaware, once fed by tim
bered watersheds, were stripped, and the "initial flow of
the streams growing less. .'.-
Under these circumstances the preservation of . existing
forests and the replanting "of denuded lands became a
pressing necessity. A forestry school was started in
Cornell University, with Dr. Fernow at its head, and the
State made the necessary appropriations for its support
and equipped it for caring for the timber. Subsequently;
for reason that has not been plain, the pretext being
economy, the appropriation ;ceased. During last year
vast fires raged in, the A'dirondacks, where the State,
ovvns nearly 2,000,000 acres of;, forest. Hastily impro
vised means of fighting these fires were made use of.
Men were hired at $2 a day, under unskillful and insuffi
cient oversight to fight fire, and wercidetected in spread-

The announcement has been made that the year re

It is such institutions as the Young Men's Christian As

appalling temptations that inadequate laws and lax ad

Ito's Escape.
Marquis Ito, on whom so much de
pends in the Far East, had a narrow
escape of his life In the adventurous
days of his youth. He and his friend
Inouye incurred obloquy by their ad
vocacy of the Europeanizing of Japan,
and their political opponents resolved
upon their assassination. Ito was
tracked to the house of a lady to whom
he was attached, but the lady hid him
so securely that he could not be found,
saying that he had left her :ome hours
before, and that she would be glad if
the strangers would .^.*ve her also.
They departed, and Ito managed to get
on boar-', a vesse> bound for England,
concealed in a bale of silk. He re
mained in that bale for thirty-six hours
without either food or drink. Then he
introduced himself to the skipper and
proposed to work hla passage to Liver

"There is no statute," said Judge
Pennie, "by which an honest man
should be prevented from recovering:
his just debts. Judgment is rendered

the principal and compound interest
was entered amounted to $1600. It was

taking an appeal. '. '
There is on record in the old judg
ment books of the Justice of the Peace
now stored away in the basement of
the City Hall a case in which Judge
James C. Pennie decided years ago.
Judge Pennie occupied the bench for
over thirty years, â¢ and although he
knew veiy little law he administered
the law of justice in such a way as to
hold on to his place against all odds.
The case alluded to is briefly this:
Sam C. Harding, then a collector o'f
bad debts, one day met a man whom
he had known for years. The man
borrowed $20 of Harding^ giving his
note for the same at 6 per cent inter
est.' The note was merely a joke at
the time, but years passed on and the
borrower made a big strike in the Ne
vada mines and years after he visited*
the city with his pockets bulging out
with gold coin. In a saloon on Mont
gomery street the new Croesus met
Harding. A rough bantering was In
dulged in, in which Harding took of
fense at some remark of his friend. He
then upbraided his friend's ingratitude
in not paying his debt. The man swore
he would never pay the $20. Harding
sued him and when the case came to
trial before Judge Pennie the statute
of limitation was Invoked.
Justice Never Outlaws.
When morning comes if inquiries are
made the reply should not be, "A
wretched night, I scarcely slept at all,"
but "1 slept very well part of the
night," ignoring all the wakeful hours
and making no allusion whatever to
them. Not once through the day
should there be the expression of a
doubt whether sleep will come or not,
but the mind should be made to feel
that sleep is' certain to come. The
thought should be constantly kept in
mind that sweet sleep is waiting with
the darkness. This is the one cure for
insomnia, and it has nothing against it,
not even improbability. It was the
method discovered by the writer after
months of testing fruitlessly the va
rious cures usually advised.
It takes time and a strong will to put
a decided suggestion to rout when one
is first beginning, to practice this meth
od, how long depending naturally
enough upon the control one has over
one's mind. Possibly this may be called
self-hypnotism, but it has the merit of
strengthening the mind at the same
time that it heals the trouble.
Nothing but good can follow the ac
quisition of the power of . driving out
harmful thoughts by better ones, what
ever form the undesirable thoughts
take. It may take a month to make this
remedy effective, or it may take *' a
longer time, but when tne ability to do
this is once one's own it is always dX
hand.
One may work this cure if one will
under the most adverse circumstances,
but it is well to have one's , surround
ings for one's aid rather* than to have
to struggle against them, as Jt is some
thing of an effort at best. There
should be close attention to the details
of ventilation, and to the comfort of
the room, and the atmosphere should
be that of which the would-be sleeper
Is unconscious, for the body should be
at ease. A warm room is; more Â¦condu
cive than a cold 'one to slumber. .
When one \va"kes in the ' night the
proper thing to do is to keep the mind
oalm and to think "how pleasant it is
that I can go to sleep again." After a
month's wakefulness it is probable that
this thought will not at once produce
the desired plumber. It may not to
night nor to-morrow night, but it will
in the end. 'f? '
To replace a rooted suggestion with
another is not easy, but it must be done
if one is to return to refreshing slum
ber without seeking new scenes which
of themselves will usually change the
suggestion. That is" one reason why
the country helps one to sleep. Imme
diately one says, "How delightfully
quiet it is here. I know I shall sleep
to-night," and that thought drives out
the other which has been keeping re
pose away. Â¦Â¦t'is*
Only the victim of insomnia knows
how it takes the nerve and life out of
those who suffer from it. It is said
that ten daj's without sleep is the long
est time that any person was ever able
to go before insanity or death followed,
and if there were no slumber whatever
one would become mentally unbalanced
in less time.
Any one who has known the horrors
of a mind that cannot rest will find it
easy to credit that statement. The true
terrors of insomnia are known only to
the individual who has lain night after
night with body heavy with sleep and
mind working every instant.
One victim of this trouble said: "It
is a queer experience I have just been
through. I heard Ida come into the
room, knew all you said, heard her go
out; indeed, I knew all that was going
on, and yet I awoke by hearing myself
snore." That sort of sleep is genuine
insomnia, and it is a much worse con
dition than the usual sleeplessness, be
cause, though the body Is getting a
measure of rest, the mind, which needs
it more, Is more alert than before one
sought sleep. It is a most painful state.
The first step toward a cure is to
change the suggestion in the subjective
mind, and this is no small task. When
one has had ljight after night of wake
fulness it is one of the hardest mental
tasks possible to approach one's "couch
as one who lies down to pleasant
dreams." Naturally, the objective mind
will be saying, "Of course you won't
sleep any more than you have for a
month. You'd much better take a sul
fonal powder," and the subjective
mind absorbs this suggestion. Such a
one should never be strengthened by
being put into words, but, or. the con
trary, should be driven out whenever
it returns.

Insomnia.
HOLLOWING the recommendations of President
Roosevelt in hi? annual message, a bill has been
introduced by Mr. t Gardner of Massachusetts pro
viding for the appointment of a commission to report
to Congress at its next session what legislation is desir
able for the development of the American merchant
marine and American commerce. The commission is to
be composed of the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmas
ter General, the Secretary of the Department of Com
merce and Labor, the chairman of the Committee on
Commerce of the Senate, the chairman of the Committee
on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House, three
Senators to be designated by the President of the Senate
and three Representatives to be designated by the
Speakerâ at least two of these Senators and two of the
Representatives to be Democrats.
Until-this .commission reports it is hardly likely that
any effective step will be taken to provide for our mer
chant marine the governmental protection it requires to
maintain itself in competition with the subsidized mer
chant fleets of other countries, and it is therefore to be
hoped the commission will be promptly created and set
to work. Our foreign commerce is expanding enor
mously, while we have no adequate fleet to carry it.
The consequence is that we have to pay to foreign'ship
owners a heavy annual tribute in the way of freight
rates that ought to be kept at home for the promotion
of our shipyards and our merchant service.
In a recent address Mr. Austin, Chief. of the Bureau of
Statistics of the Department of Commerce and Labor,
presented a striking showing of the rapid growth of our
export and import trade as compared with that of Gr.eat
Britain, France and Germany. In the course of his re
marks he said:
"These three countries, combined with the United
States, supply one-half the total international commerce
of the world, and it is therefore unnecessary to con
sider the other countries, in * an attempt to determine
what our commercial growth has been as compared
with the other great nations of the world. Taking still
the year 1870 as a starting point, and comparing condi
tions in the four countries in 1876* with the latest avail
able data, it may be said that the exports of France have
increased $277,000,000, those of the United Kingdom
$443,000,000, those -of Germany $607,000,000, and those
of the United States $1,028,000,000; the increase of the
United States being equal to that of Germany and the
United Kingdom combined, and nearly equal to. all of the
three countries under consideration. Comparing the
growth by percentage of increase, it may be said that
the United Kingdom shows a gain of 45 per cent,
France 50" per cent, . Germany no per cent " and the
â¢United States 260 per cent. In 1870 the United States
stood at the bottom of the list, her exports being less
than those of any of the three nations named; in 1903
she stands at the head of the list, her exports being
greate'r than those of any other of the countries under
consideration. These figures, it is proper to say, relate
to exports of domestic merchandise* only, and do not in
clude the re-exportation of foreign or colonial merchan
dise, which forms' a considerable share of the total ex
ports of the European countries* in question, especially
the United Kingdom."
Such is the nature of our commerce across the seas.
We are the richest of nations, the most enterprising
arid the most progressive, and yet we have hardly a
visible showing among the merchant fleets of the world.
Since it seems that a commission is deemed necessary
to'make these, and similar facts, known to Congress be
fore legislation can be obtained, it behooves us to get
the commission promptly. The Gardner bill should
have the cordial support of all friends of our merchant
service and should be enacted without delay.

"Since the recent abnormal cold there
are not wanting people who believe
that the theory lately advanced by

the northern hemisphere is entering

evidences than the late unlamented

body knows that the past summer was
phenomenally cool here, but Boston
takes pride in having summers cool
enough to advertise any health resort.
"News comes, however, from distant
Alaska that the output of gold for the
year has been only $8,921,157 this year,
as against $8,345,800 in 1892. This deci
ded falling off ia laid to the extremely
short summer on the Summer Penin

The previous Zeigrler expedition had the
same trouble and the failure of Com
mander Baldwin is in part attributed
to this evidence of cold beyond the nor
mal.
"Of course, the scientists may be
wrong in their apprehensions, and the
forecasted glacial period may not be
really approaching, but surely the
common signs all point in that direc
tion. When learned men and goose-bone
prophets agree it Is no wonder that

"The corn is received, weighed and
shelled, and every bushel is registered
automatically. Then the grain is sifted,
run through a blower, which removes
the dirt and dust. The clean corn then
is taken to the steeping-room, where
there is a series of large vats or tanks
made of cypress wood. These vats are
partially filled with hot water and about
1000 bushels of corn are fed into each
tub. The corn is kept in the steeping
vats for three or four days. The treat
ment gradually softens the flinty
grains and partial fermentation takes
place. The scum which rises to tne
top is skimmed off, and finally the hot
water is drawn off, and the softened
parboiled corn dropped on to a con
veyor, which carries it to the millroom,
where large burr wheels grind it. Cold
water, is fed into the mills with the
corn, and the mixture, which looks like
thin gruel, runs through pipes into a
stone cistern, ,where it is constantly
agitated with more cold water.
. "From the cistern the mixture is
pumped on to a series of sieves called
ehakers. The sieves are made of silk
bolting cloth, and the frames are con
etantly shaken by machinery. The
sieves are on a slant, and the contin
uous trembling Â¦ releases the starch
granules from the refuse, which slides
off the ends of the screens in bins and
later is sold for cattle feed. The starch
granules, with the water, fall through
the meshes of the bolting cloth upon a
cement floor, run into a gutter and then
into a cistern. From this cistern It is
pumped to the first settling tub, where
It is allowed to rest over night. The
sour water on top is "drawn off and
fresh water, made alkaline by a weak
solution of caustic soda, is run in and
thoroughly mixed with the starch.
"The weak alkali dissolves the gluten
which sticks to the . starch granules,
making the starch comparatively pure.
The starch is allowed to settle again,
and then is taken to the runhouse, in
which are a number of shallow troughs
about three feet wide and twenty feet
ltng, made of slate. The slate bottom
is perfectly smooth, and the troughs
slant on a grade of about one inch in
eighty feet. The sides of the trough
are made of stone or cement. "The
etarch and water mixture slowly en
ters the head of the trough, or 'ways, 1
as they are' calleH, and almost imper
ceptibly moves toward -the lower end.
"The etarch granules, being heavier
"The wall paper also had been 'sired*
-.vith the â¢white stuff, and I suppose the
covers of every book we had in the
house were pasted with starch.
"Millions of bushels of corn are used
every year in the manufacture of this
essential product, and considerable
â¢wheat is consumed also in making what
i3 known as 'wheat starch.* 'Potato'
flour is potato Etarch. and in the good
old days our grandmothers used to got
their starch by grating potatoes, mixing
the mash with water, and then, after
allowing the mixture to settle, secured
Ftarch by frequent decanting and wash
ings.
"In principle that is the way starch
is made from corn to-day, although
much expensive machinery Â»s employ
ed and everv menas possible used to
get t&e largest yield in its purest and
most attractive form. If you split a
grain of corn flatwise you will see the
starch its natural condition, but en
veloped in substances which later be
come the refuse of the starch factory
mixed with gluten. This gluten must
be washed out and the refuse stun* re
moved in order to get the pure starcn,
and the process in general runs about
as follows :
"The wall caper was kept on the
plaster because of starch in the paste,
every picture in a frame was pasted
with starch, and I knew that the
Brussels carpet under the table, at one
part of its making, had been fairly
soaked in starch so as to make it stiff
and firm. The cotton fibers of the stuff
of which mv wife's shirt waist was
made had been 'sized* in starch during
the process of making the cloth, and
the cotton thread used in sewing it had
been treated with starch the same way.
(Copyright, 1904, br Joeeph B. Bowlet.)
Said the wholesale grocer as he
picked up a flngerful of the article in
question.
"Have yon ever considered the part
which starch. Just plain, ordinary
starch, plays in your everyday affairs?
Don't you know that it would be prac
tically impossible to live in these times
â¢without starch; that If starch were
suddenly removed from the earth thou
sands and ten thousands of working
people would be without employment,
and that what vou call the industrial
Â¦world would eet a shock which would
be felt in every part of it?
"I went through a starch factory not
long ago, and since then I have had
more respect for the article which we
cell by the carloads. The other even
ing at dinner I looked around the table
and room and mentally catalogued the
â¢etarch' effects. My shirt bosom was
uncomfortably stiff because of the
stuff, and the dab of powder on my
wife's nose I knew had more or less
perfumed starch in it. The biscuits
brought in by the maid were light and
flaky because of the baking powder
used in their making, and the basis of
a baking: powder is starch.. Starch gave
the elegant finish to the napkins and
tablecloth, and the pudding which
came along later was largely built up
on corn starch.

Provisions, too, are not in satisfactory condition. The
great Western packing concerns at Chicago and else
where several weeks ago loaded themselves up with a
large yne of pork and beef products and then unloaded
them upon the scattered outside trade, which now holds
the great portion of the stock, with the market depressed
and slowly, declining to a lower plane of values all
around. Stocks of everything in this branch of industry
are reported large and steadily accumulating, which does
not give much promise for the immediate future. Hides,
however, are more active and have lately developed more
tone, with some advances, notably in foreign descrip
tions.
The statistical condition of the markets is irregular.
The country's bank clearings showed a los,s of 18.8 per
cent last week, with about half of the largest cities on the
losing side of the â¢ exhibit. The aggregate clearings,
however, kept up to a good volume, being about $2,265;
000,000. The loss at New York was 27.8 per cent. The
failures for the week were 324, against 267 for the corre
sponding week last year." The range, for the general run
of staples was the'highest for a year and 37 points above
the low level of 1896, though 7 per cent below the high
est point of 1000. The exports of wheat and flour from
the country were 2,771,000 bushels, against 4,878,000- last
year. The distribution of â¢general merchandise is in
creasing, the best reports coming in from the West and
South. . '
In California the weather is the governing Jactor at
the moment. While the central and northern parts of the
State have received sufficient moisture for the present,
the south and southern end of the San Joaquin Valley
are suffering from drought. The Weather Bureau re
ports pasturage almost gone and some sheep and cattle
dying on the ranges. Corn is being fed to stock in these
sections, but this is expensive. According to the
Weather Bureau the current year is the dryest known
since 1863-64, when no rain fell at Los Angeles during
the whole winter. But they depend largely upon spring
rains in the lower part, of the State.
Otherwise the condition of business in California is
satisfactory. Money continues plentiful, the local and
export business of this port continues good, there is no
pessimism expressed in any quarter, and with the usual
spring rains fair crops arc practically assured. Prices for
almost everything in the farming line are above the aver
age of the past few years and in some' lines away above
it. This is especially noticeable in hops and hay, which
are bringing fine jarices, while 'no line reports any de
pression, except possibly raisins, which are dull, with a
large line of last year's crop still on hand. Taking the
State as a whole, therefore, the outlook is fair.
THERE was an 'encouraging feature to trade last
week v It was the early opening of the spring busi
ness. It seldom opens so promptly after the holi
days and is often.delayed as late as the 1st of February.
But last week's reports all indicated resumption of
business after the holiday lull, with indications of a- good
demand for general merchandise during the rest of. the
winter. In this respect, if in no other,, the new.- year is
opening better than the old year closed! Â¦â¢, *
' There is still another improvement in the comparison.
The feeling of pessimism and dread so general an'djcon
spicuous during the last half of 1903 seemsto- have dis
appeared altogether and is replaced by : one of buoyancy
and confidence. This is particularly noticeable amonij
the New York bankers, who are pleased with- the unex
pected abundance of money and the cheerful trade re
ports, coming in from all over the country. Private re
ports received in this city last, week from the best posted
operators in Wall street said that the stock market" was
in splendid condition, and were it not for the Eastern
war clouds would doubtless be active and at higher quo
tations than those now prevailing. But the Eastern
complications are delaying the reaction which everybody
thinks is coming by leading the general public to "hold
aloof, expecting that a formal declaration of war will
cause a transitory decline in, stocks, thus presenting them
an opportunity to step in and buy for the rise which
would probably follow the first decline. As long as' the
war situation .hangs as a menace over the market the
much desired and expected reaction cannot very, well
take place. ; ! .;Â¦ Â¦"'
The industrial situation is. showing some improvement
and the favorable statements from the different lines
outnumber the unfavorable ones. The iron and steel
trade is showing more life and "a gradual resuscitation
from the depression of the past six; months. : The read
justment of wage schedules to a lower plane went into
effect January 1 with practically no friction whatever,
and the output of the crude material seems to be increas
ing again. The decline in this branch of the industry
was very severe, the production falling off from the high
water mark of 20,000,000 tons to 12,000,000 tons, the nor
mal quantity being about 17,000,000 tons. Many plants
have resumed operations and a better demand for^ struc
tural material is reported, while the decline in quota
tions seems checked for the moment at least.
The textiles, however, are not making as good a show
ing as iron and steel at the moment. Lower prices are
quoted for new lines of woolens, which is an undisguised
disappointment to the trade. The cotton industry is still
seriously hampered by the unsettled prices for the raw
material, fluctuations being sharp and frequent and every
day or so severe. This of course renders manufacturers
very cautious in buying and also tends to keep the whole
sale merchants out of the market except to fill immediate
wants, such as keeping up assortments, etc.
ing' instead of putting it out," in order to continue in em
ployment. "~
At the end, of the'season expert and disinterested men,
familiar with the burned region, were employed to re
port the loss caused by the year's fires. They have just
reported that the loss is $813,664, a sum, that I would
have kept the forestry school going for several genera
tions, and would have supplied therefrom expert fores
ters to guard again st fire, who would not have spread
it for the sake of employment.
New York is now -figuring up her. gains by deserting
the school of forestry, and the people are again demand
ing protection of the fertility of their soil and 'the flow
of. their streams by proper official action.
But when will California get awake to the importance,
of. her* own forests? . At present they are deserted by the

have been the sentiment of our people. VVe need-for
estry schools in our universities, to supply trained men.
We need a Forestry Commission composed of such
men. We need every care and protection that can be
given to our forests. Will we get it?
Policeman Shannon, a brawny blue
coat on the Oakland force, hasn't re
covered from the shock yet. It was
all because he tried to hold up a be
lated pedestrian, who proved to be a
deaf mute and couldn't respond to the
demands of the insistent patrolman
who had stopped the silent wayfarer
during an early morning watch.
Shannon saw the object of his watch
ful vigil for night prowlers walking
rapidly along the street. The police
rules require that belated citizens
shall be v stopped and unless satisfac
tory reply be given the accosted per
son must be sent to police headquar
ters for investigation. The rule main
tains for the proper lookout at night
for suspicious characters. So Shan
non hailed his . man. No response.
Again did the patrolman give hail.
Again was there no sign. Quickening
his gait he speeded after the disap
pearing figure. Another call and only
an echo of the bluecoat's cry respond
ed. The silent figure still swung on
its way, heedless of al! effort to attract
him.
"I wonder if the man's a. rogue or
crazy," thought Shannon hustling
along and getting close enough to
catch a good grip on the unresponsive
pedestrian's shoulder.
With a grunt of surprise the held-up
citizen stopped and tried to escape
from the heavy clutch. This only
aroused Shannon's suspicions.
"Oh, no, my boy. I have you now,
and you'll tell who you are before you
get away," declared Shannon.
Not a murmur from the now thor
oughly excited man.
"Who are you?" demanded the pa
trolman.
Not a word.
For ten minutes Shannon struggled.
The mute made signs and almost frac
tured his fingers trying to enlighten
the patrolman. . At last he managed to
get a bit cf paper and a pencil. In the
flicker of the street light he wrote:
"I'm dumb."
"I'm r** ejaculated Shannon, as
he dropped his hold and went about
face to the other end, of his beat.
The Mute.
"After ten or fifteen hours the boxes
are turned upside down, the blocks of
starch fall out to be sliced Into smaller
blocks, which go Into ovens, where the
moisture is evaporated. The crust
which forms over the blocks is scraped
off with knives, leaving hard blocks of
starch. The starch is again subjected
to a drying heat, and finally is ready
to be packed. The fine starch of the
best grade is pulverized and becomes
'corn starch' for cooking purposes,
and the other"~grades are packed sep
arately into boxes ready for shipment.
So you see, after all, It is a simple
matter to make starchâ all you need
is a good deal of money to start with.
The consumption increases yearly, so
you need not fear being without a mar
ket."
than the water and dissolved gluten,
gradually get to. the bottom and stick
to the slate, and at night, when the
flow is over/ the troughs are covered
with wet starch, snow white, from four
inches thick at the head, graduating to
a mere film at the foot. The next
morning the starch, is shoveled on to
wide belts, which convey it to cement
cisterns, where it is agitated again
with cold water and then pumped into
settling tanks. This process is repeated
several times, and then the mixture
goes into the separating tubs, where
the several grades of starch arrange
themselves in layers, the poorest and
lightest being at the top. Each grade
is drawn off and the starch goes into
boxes, which arÂ« lined with loose pieces
of unbleached muslin. The meshes of
the fabric are too small to allow the
starch to escape, so that only the water
is drained off. . '

Glass to Cover the Wine Tanks.
SANTA ROSA. Jan. 17.â The Italian
Swiss Agricultural Colony, of which
P. C. Rossi and Andrea Sbarboro of
San Francisco are president and secre
tary respectively, are carrying out some
important improvements at their mam
moth winery and cellars at Astl. Thess
consist of encaslnsr some of their. wine
tanks in glass with an outer surface
of cement. This is the most sanitary
measure known of keeping wine and
may be adapted for all the wineries of
the Italian- Swiss colony.
Imperial Intends to Incorporate.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 17.â E. F. Howe,
editor of the Imperial Press on the
desert side of the county, brings word
that Imperial Is about to start the ma
chinery of the law so that the town
may incorporate as a city of the sixth
class. The first steps will have to be
taken by the Board of Supervisors.
There will be about 70,000 acres of land
under cultivation this- year and there
will be big grain shipments to come
cut. The work of grading foF the Im

ALAMEDA COUNTY RECEIVES
LARGEST APPROPRIATION
SAN MATEO'S GROWTH.
The San Mateo Times says that
"while San Ma'teo County is one of the
smallest counties in the State it is
one of the most prosperous. The
population has increased more in the
last three years than in any decade
previously, and is conservatively es
timated at 15,000 as against 12,094 in,
1900. While this -increase has been,
in a measure, distributed throughout
the county, it has been largest at^San
Mateo and on the northern bay bor
der. The proportionate increase in
wealth is even greater. The assessed
valuation for 1903 is In round numbers
$19,000,000, an increase of more than
$2,000,000 in one year.
"A consolidated statement from all
the builders shows that about $410,
000 has been invested in new build
ings during the year in San Mateo
city and immediate environs. The ad
vantages of this county as a suburban
residential section have become so ob
vious that hundreds are moving. here
from the more congested cities about
the bay. Many whose business is in
San Francisco prefer a short ride by
railway to boat travel across the bay.
"Projected improvements for next
year indicate that the growth will be
much greater than this. Among the
enterprises about to be closed is one
for a large tourist hotel, plans for
which have been drawn. Opportu
nities for sudden fortune or the rapid
accumulation of great wealth are rare
in San Mateo County, but there are
scores of industries whereby men of
average ability and small means may
earn a competency. The county sup
ports but twenty-seven indigents.
"Its location and transportation
facilities, however, pre-eminently
adapt this county to -the needs of a
suburban population, and in time the
entire country adjacent to the railway
lines will be filled with the overflow
from San Francisco." J.
PAYS UP ITS DEBT.
The Â¦ Tulare Register reports that
the Tule River Irrigation District id
now practically free from debt. All
the bonds, with the exception of
about $2000. have been surrendered.
The canceled bonds will be destroyed
at Woodville.. ,
"The Woodville people were highly
elated when they learned that $96,600
of the bonds had [ been canceled and
made harmless," says the Register.
"It was a very hard struggle with
nearly all of them to raise the neces
sary amount to pay their share of the
big tax, but they met the issue brave
ly and they conqured. Land titles
have been made transferable and
homeseekers canJbe guaranteed free
dom from bonded indebtedness. The
Tule River district country ought, and
doubtless will, from now on progress
steadily with other parts of the coun
ty and valley. A boom need not b*
looked for, but confidence has been
restored and there will be a growth."
took the contract for cleaning the
streets of the. entire city for one year.
As the appropriation- by the city was
not sufficient to perform- the work un
der the new system, which was pro
posed, the association .called upon ilÂ«
members and the public for subscrip
tions to pay the additional cost for a
six months' experiment. Nearly $30,000
was secured and the streets were for
the first time cleaned and the business
district was kept clean. The experi
ment was so successful that the city
willingly accepted the association's
specifications when the next contract
was let and provided sufficient funds
Â¦for continuing the system.
PRACTICAL MEASURES.
Street sprinkling was next taken up
by the association. Formerly the only
sprinkling done was performed by a
few private contractors, who undertook
to sprinkle certain blocks or portions
of blocks in front of the stores of
those merchants who would pay for the
service. This, of course, was very un
satisfactory. No uniform sprinkling
was done. In some cases, If a mer
chant subscribed and his neighbors on
each side did not, only the street in
front of him was sprinkled and he re
ceived the dust from both sides.
The association undertook to have
the streets of Uie business district uni
formly sprinkled at the expense of the
city. In order to determine the best
method of sprinkling the various pave
ments, the association, at its own ex
pense, hired sprinkling carts and
sprinkled a number- of streets for a
month. The results were embodied in
a set of specifications for street sprink
ling which were accepted by the Board
of Public Works and the work has been
carried on by the city ever since.
In order to hasten, the removal of
cobble pavements on' many business
streets which were Injured by such
rough pavements, the association in
duced the property owners to subscribe
one-half the cost of the work of re
paving a number of such blocks, on
condition that the city would pay the
Â«ther half df the cost. Portions of
Kearny, from Market to California;
Geary, from Market to Powell; Stock
ton, from Market to Sutter; Post, from
Market ; to Stockton; Fourth, from
Market to Mission, and various other
blocks were, in this way, repaved'Avith
modern pavements a long time before
the work would otherwise have been
done. â¢ .
LIGHTING,. THE STREETS.
In order to demonstrate the advan
tages of lighting the retail business
streets by electricity instead of the
ordinary gas lamps, the association un
dertook to light for six months a num
ber of these streets by suspending an
electric arc light over the center of
each crossing and in the biddle of each
block. - ' *
The. expense of the experiment v was
about â¢ $15,000. which was paid for by
a popular subscription by merchants
and property owners along the streets
so lighted, The association then pre
sented to the Supervisors a complete
plan for lighting in this manner all of
the business sections of the city and
the results of the experimental light
ing* having been so successful, the Su
pervisors : adopted the association's
plan. , .:
CHEAP PARK BUSES.
;. While -doing the street cleaning, the
association .became convinced that the
street sweeping, which formerly had
been dumped on low lying - grounds,
would be a valuable fertilizing material
for Golden Gate Park. Plans were'ac
cordingly made for a system of bunkers
in . which the sweepings could be de
posited by the teams hauling them from
the : streets, -and arrangements made
to have ..them hauled to Golden Gate
Park in electric cars, the! Park Com
missioners paying the transportation.
The bunkers were constructed at Elev
enth ; and Bryant streets by the Icity
and over i 3000 . cubic l yards of " valuable
fertilizing material are now sent to the
park each -month instead of being
wasted on ,the; public dumps, as' was
formerly the, case.
: While, 'the superintendent of the as
sociatlori was investigating for the as-
sociatiou municipal improvements in
the principal Eastern cities, ;his atten
tion was attracted by the cheap public
conveyances in use at Niagara Falls
and Belle Isle Park, Detroit. Upon his
return, he recommended the establish
ment of a similar system at Golden
Gate Park. In conjunction with the
Park Commission, a route, covering
about four miles and embracing the
principal features of the park, was laid
out and arrangements were made with
a local carriage company to run one
or more large wagonettes regnlarly
over this route for a fare of only 10
cents for each passenger. Stop-over
tickets were issued which permitted
passengers to stop at various points of
interest and finish the trip in any sub
sequent wagonette, without extra
charge.
The cheap bus system has been a great
benefit. Besides being used by many
tourists, it has enabled hundreds of
poor people, particularly women and
children, to enjoy the park in a way
that %vould otherwise be denied them.
It had .been frequently noticed that
when large parades were held here the
police force, unaided, were not able to
restrain the crowds suffici'ntly to pre
vent the parade from being obstructed.
The Merchants' Association undertook
to solve this problem, believing that if
some means could be found by which
the streets could be kept entirely clear
during parades an extra inducement
would be offered for holding â¢ inven
tions in San Francisco.
A scheme was accordingly devised of
sinking in the pavement along the curb
conical iron sockets, with caps flush
with the street surface, into which
wooden, posts could be Inserted and
wire ropes stretched when parades
were to be held.
For the purpose of furnishing an ob
ject lesson of the benefits of this
scheme, the association, at Its own ex
pense, equipped both sides of Market
street from the ferries to Van Ness av
enue with these metal sockets and the
necessary wooden posts. The cost was
about $1100, and the appliances were
presented to the city. The plan was
found to .work so well that the city sub.
sequently equipped, in a similar man
ner, the regular, line of parades on
Montgomery street, Kearny street and
Van Ness avenue.
TAKING DOWN WIRES.
The association, in conjunction. with
the chief of* the Department of Elec
tricity and the various electrical com
panies,^prepared an ordinance requir
ing the removal of all poles and over
head wires, except trolley poles and
wires, from the business districts of
the city within a fixed period of time.
An agreement was also secured from
all companies having overhead wires,
that they would comply with the terms
of the ordinance without opposition,
and the wires are now underground in
half of the district prescribed.
Another important improvement ef
fected by the association was the pas
sage of an ordinance requiring that
grooved girder rails should be used in
the construction or reconstruction of
all street railway tracks after January
1, 1903. These rails have recently been
laid on Third street. .
To prevent the streets from being
disfigured with unsightly advertising
signs, projecting over sidewalks and at
the same time to: give merchants tho
legal right to use such signs as were
necessary . in, their business, the asso
ciation prepared and securer the pas
sage of .an ordinance prescribing ex
actly what classes of signs could be
used and under what conditions. All
merchants now â¢ have _ equal privileges
and % the ordinance has given general
satisfaction, besides greatly improving
the appearance of the streets.
AN ISLE OF -.SAFETY.
For the purpose of providing for the
safety and , convenience of pedestrians
boarding street cara on Market street
in front of L.otta*s ; Fountain, the as
sociation- constructed at this point an
isle of safety, consisting of a long, nar
row cement platform,, with ornamental
stone buffers and seats at each end,
where, people could wait in safety until
their" cars* arrived. ' The station * cost
$561. 'The expense was borne by the
To-day there are 1305 public spirit
ed business firms enrolled as members
of the Merchants' Association, all
united in an earnest endeavor to im
prove San Francisco. The success of
an organization is determined by
what it accomplishes. Not only must
it do things, but some of them at
least must be of a physical character,
visible, and a direct benefit to its
members or the community, or the
interest of its membership will wane
and the usefulness of the organization
be lessened and eventually ended.
Various authorities on municipal
affairs throughout the United States
have fre4uently quoted the Merchants'
Association of San Francisco as one
of the most successful organizations
of its kind. The long life and steady
growth of the association would
seem to bear out these statements..
TEX ACTIVE YEARS.
On AdH1 15 of the present year the
Merchants' Association will be ten
years old. It was organized in 1894
with 47 members. The first year the
membership increased to 214, the sec
ond year to 406, the third year to 817,
the fourth to 953, the fifth to 1061,
the sixth to 1191. the seventh to 1289.
Such steady increase in membership
for a period of ten years could be se
cured in only two ways. The associa
tion must have had the confidence of
the community in regard to its pur
poses and management aÂ«d it must
have succeeded in doing something.
The various boards of directors have
all felt that for the Merchants' Asso
ciation to fill the position in the com
munity which it should, it was not
sufficient simply to pass resolutions
calling attention to things which
should be done, but the association
must take hold and itself make im
provements.
Recognizing the fact that San Fran
cisco is at a distance from other large
cities and therefore not in close touch
with them in their prog
ress, -the association in 1898 sent its
superintendent on an extended trip
through Eastern cities to investigate
their municipal improvements- for the
purpose of seeing what other i cities
were doing in that direction and what
hints San Francisco could take from
their experience. His trip covered a
number of weeks, during which time
the principal Eastern cities were visit
ed, their municipal officials inter
viewed, and their methods studied.
Valuable experience and a great
amount of data were thus secured
which has resulted in a number of
improvements being effected in- 'this
city in its street cleaning, sprinkling,
lighting, paving, etc.
INVESTIGATES AXD ACTS..
The association almost invariably re
frains from recommending to the city
officials any particular Improvement
unless it Is satisfied from its own in
vestigations that it is practicable and
can at the same time point out how
it can* be done and if necessary fur
nish plans for doing it. The conse
quence has been that when the asso
ciation does recommend something the
officials feel assured that the matter Is
not of a trivial nature, that it has been
well considered by the directors and
that it is practical. It remains for the
officials to decide upon the policy of
acting and whether there are funds
available at that ime for carrying out
the improvement
If, as sometimes happens, funds are
not available, or an object lesson is
needed to convince the city of the ben
efit of the proposed improvement, the
association itself undertakes to perform
the work.
Thus, previous to 1894, the streets of
San Francisco were in a deplorable
condition as regards cleaning, sprink
ling and paving. The association Im
mediately after its organization took
up the question of strep* cleaning. A'
thorough Investigation convinced the
directors that; the streets never, could
be properly cleaned under the existing
system and that an entire change ; wa3
necessary. ' -
. To demonstrate the correctness of its
position and to show that . the streets
could be well cleaned the association

association, and the station was pre
.sented to the "city.
The convenience of the station wa3
immediately apparent and probably no
one thing accomplished by the associa
tion benefits so many people every day
in the^year as this. The object lesson
accomplished the "purpose intended and
the city is preparing to construct a
similar station at the intersection of
Market and Powell streets, while the
property owners in the vicinity of Mar
ket and Fourth streets are about to
build one at that point.
Probably the greatest and most nec
essary improvement made by the Mer
chants' Association was the construc
tion of the free public convenience sta
tion at Union Square. The need for
public lavatories in San * Francisco
has been lÂ«cig felt. The association for
years urged that they be constructed.
"While the need for such conveniences
was acknowle'dged, no definite action
by the city authorities was secured.
; The association finally determined that
it would itself construct one as an ob
ject t lesson. Accordingly a modern
double underground public convenience
station for both men and women was
constructed by the association at an
expense of $5200, beneath the sidewalk
adjacent to Union Square on Stockton
street and was formally presented to
the city several months ago.
The Park Commissioners agreed to
provide attendants and to properly
care fo: the station. The need for such
a convenience was aemonstrated at
once. The average attendance in both
departments is about 1500 per day. The
stations are equipped in the most san
itary manner and are furnished with
electric lights and ventilating fans.
Soap, towels, etc., are furnished free.
The above shows some of the prin
cipal physical or visible improvements
which the Merchants' Association has
actually constructed. Many other less
visible improvements have been also
secured. Many minor matters come up
and are disposed of almost as a matter
of routine and are never noticed by
the public at large or by the members
of the association, unless they happen
to be directly affected. All taken to
gether, however, assist in Improving
the city and its government and there
by the comfort and happiness of its
..people, and .thus justify the continued
existence of the association.

The San Jose News say$:
The Pajaro Board of Trade has declined to
exhibit "at St. Louis in a district composed of
the counties of Santa Cruz Monterey and
San Luis Obispo The Pajaro board will ex
hibit its products in thi- California State
buiidin; and as a part of the exhibits of this
t-'tate. It is underrtood that the counties of
Bar. Luis Obispo and Monterey will form a
district of their own, and commence forward

pared, or in course of preparation, some 400
exhibits.
The Santa Rosa Democrat says that
the Sonoma County oBard of Trade in
tends to enlarge its sphere of useful
ness during the present year, advertis
ing all sections of Sonoma. The Dem
ocrat reports that during the past year
Secretary Luce answered 15,000 letters
from persons asking information con
cerning Sonoma County. Mr. Luce sent
out 8000 copies of the Sonoma County
Board of Trade Journal and other lit
erature. He also contributed fifteen
articles embodying statistics regarding
the products of "the county. These arti
cles were furnished to the United States
Department of Agriculture at Washing
ton, the State Department and to dif
ferent publications."
Men and Women Give
Time and Labor for
Public Good.
The development of this State must
largely depend upon combined effort.
This fact is clearly seen and the result
is the formation of many improvement
clubs, boards of trade, chambers of
commerce and kindred organizations
for the purpose of taking the steps
best calculated to effect an advance. It
is observable, and this should be un
derstood fully by the strangers who are
looking Into matters connected with
California, that the cities and the in
terior towns are alike eagerly striving
to improve their conditions.
Much space is given this morning to
an admirable review by L. M. King,
secretary and superintendent for the
Merchants' Association of San Fran
cisco, of the physical betterments that
the association has been instrumental
in instituting in San Francesco. The
association has also had a strong effect
on legislation and excellent measures
are justly credited to it.
Considerable space is also devoted
to-day to some account of the doings
of organizations in the Interior that are
devoting their efforts to - upbuilding
their respective sections. The people of
the State will see in these organiza
tions and In their acts signs of ccrnlng
great gcod to the commonwealth.
During the last week an organization
has been formed in San Francisco to
be known as- "The Association for the
Improvement and Adornment of San
Francisco." This association has a
wide programme, included in which is
much that is utilitarian as well as or
namental. An executive committee
has been appointed, which consists of
ex-Mayor Phelan, "W. A. Irwin, "William
Greer Harrison, Allan Pollok. 5\ W.
Dohrmann and Herbert E. Law.
Another indication of enterprise that
has come to the front in San Francisco
In the week just closed is r. proposi
tion that has been formally Indorsed
by the directors of the Merchants' As
sociation and California Promotion
Committee for holding a world's fair
in San Francisco in 1S13. This matter

W. A. Beard, secretary of the Sac
ramento Valley Derelopment Associa
tion, tells the Sacramento Bee that
â¢"Redding is enjoying an era of growth
such as comes to few cities of its size.
I was told that the population is now
less than 4000, but the new buildings
indicate a city of many thousand in
habitants. A $20,000 hotel is considered
a. prize by most towns of that size,
but liedding has one that cost $75,000.
This was lately completed, and is but
one of several fine buildings erected
there curing the past two years. Oth
ers are a $40,000 hi?h school building.
a $20,000 grammar school, a $2000 pri
mary school, a $10,000 library, business
T-.uildings that cost ?:S,000, J18.000 and
S12.0C0. besides several smaller blocks
and numerous residences costing from
iZOOQ down.
"The building era is accompanied by
<l campaign of civic improvements that
would do credit to a much larger city.
A rock-crusher has been purchased by
the city fathers and the streets are be
ir.g macadamized. The work is being
done scientifically, official grades being
fixed and the roadways thoroughly
prepared for the coating of rock. A
drain sewer is being built to carry off
surplus rain water, and still other im
provements are contemplated. All this
improvement betoken/; a high degree
of prosperity, and it is largely due to
the rapid development of the mining
and electrical pow*>r industries about
Redding and throughout the tributary
region.
The Woman's Improvement Club of
N'epa has filled vacancies in office by
electing Mrs, *F. L. Coombs and Miss
Mary Buck/py as vice presidents and

It was announced from Port au
Prince January 7 that the French Min
ister to Hayti had made an amicable
demand that the arrested French offi
cials of the National bank be provision
ally released, basing his request on
the eround of humanity and the un
healthy condition of the prisons.
CAPE HAYTIEN, Jan. 17.â Five per
sons connected with the conspiracy
headed by General Monplaisar to start
a . revolt against General Nord, and
condemned to death by a military tri
bunal, were executed" to-day in the
presence of a vast crowd. Several for
eigners who took part in the conspir
acy will probably be deported.
The Government finally refuses to set
at liberty the officials at the National
bank charged with participation in the
issuance of $200,000 in fraudulent se
curities early last year.
The first cabin passengers were: C.
Thompson. J. MacManus, M. M. Bazan,
M. SaRo Henderson, Mrs. Maria Hen
derson. Wilhelm Tornee, Mrs. "Wilhel
rriine Tornee, Miss Drega Tornee. Fran
cisco Aguire and Henrique Aguire.
Captain Carstons, her commander,
was on the ship Abydos at Valparaiso
when the ship Sakkarah ran ashore off
the coast of Chile. He immediately
sailed to the aid of the latter ship, and
at his peril succeeded in rescuing all
the passengers and $2,500,000 in treasure
from the wrecked ship. For these ser
vices he stated he should have received
a large amount of salvage, but he claims
that the insurance companies treated
him very badly and only gave him the
paltry sum of 5375. whereas he was
Justly entitled to many thousands of
dollars.
This is the first visit of the Mera to
this port, she having previously been
on the route between Hamburg and
Chilean ports.
Captain Carstons reports stopping at
about forty different ports en route,
but says the voyage was devoid of any
special event of interest. The vessel
brought twenty-four passengers in the
cabins and fifteen in the steerage, and
1600 tons of freight, consisting princi
pally of coffee and ores.
Among the passengers was Maximil
iano Morel Bazan. ex-Governor of Oval
le and Osorno, who comes as a scien
tific envoy of the Government of Chile,
to make industrial studies in the United
States. Japan and Europe. From this
port he will proceed to Japan by the
first steamship leaving nere.
The Mera was 129 days from Ham
burg, via Mazatlan, and came to an
chor off Folsom-street yesterday at 11
a. m., where she was obliged to remain
until this morning, while the dock is
being placed in readiness to receive
her.
Most of the fifteen are arrayed in
fanciful costumes, and several of the
men wear wonderful high top boots,
with gayly colored embroideries there
on. The women wear gay headdresses
of brilliant hues, studded with gold
coins. They brought with them a big
lot of hammered silverware articles,
some of modern make and some an
tique, and also a quantity of curios."
Whether the strange appearing arri
vals should be allowed to land is a
question that is now agitating the of
ficers of the immigration bureau. If,
as they claim, they are coppersmiths,
they will be allowed to land; but on
the oilier hand if they are wandering
gypsies they will be deported and the
steamship company will.be called upon
to take them back to the port from
which they came.
In the steerage of the steamship
Mera, which arrived yesterday from
Honolulu, via southern ports, were fif
teen passengers from Callao, who look
like a wandering band of gypsies, al
though they claim to be coppersmiths
by trade, and say they want to go into
that business in this country. The lead
er of the band is G. Juan. They range
in age from 46 down to 6. There are
six men and four women, and the rest
are children.

SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 17.â Frank
Dally, a young man of Summit, Utah,
is dead as the result of a practical joke
which some boisterous neighbors per
petrated. Dally had been married tht
evening before. With his young wife
and a friend he started from home to
drive to Enoch on the morning follow
ing the wedding ceremony. It had been
planned by friends to give the couple
a surprise party at their home in Eu
reka, and when it became known that
Dally and his bride were going to
Enoch some young men determined
that they would have some fun with
them. Accordingly all donned sheets
and caps made of white paper and lay
in wait for the couple on the road.
"When the buggy came along the
horses shied and attempted to run
away. Mrs. Dally says that her hus
band turned pale for a moment, then
flushed and turned his attention to the
horses, succeeding in bringing them to
a halt. He drove on a hundred yards
further, then suddenly threw his arms
above his head and dropped limply
across the dashboard. His bride at
tempted to revive him, but he was
dead.
In the meantime the jokers had re
turned to town and were unaware of
the tragic result of their funmakins.
Dally was 25 years old. Mrs. Dally Is
suffering from severe nervous prostra

Special Dispatch to The Call
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Jan. 17.âEigh
teen delegates to the convention of the
League of Commission Merchants were
thrown to-day into the icy waters of
Echo River, which winds a tort'uous
course through Mammoth Cave, and
were saved only by the coolness* of the
guide, John Nelson, and the heroic
work of Charles A. Muhlbronner of
Pittsburg, Pa.
The roof, of the cave over Echo River
is arched and the space in the center,
owing to the unaccountable rise in the
river, was only two and a half feet
above the water. In order to insure
the passage of the boat the men and
women were forced to stoop. At
one place the boat swerved to one side,
raking the heads of those occupants
seated next to the bank. These leaned
farther forward, which lowered one
end of the boat and the water began
to flow in rapidly.
The guide saw the danger and called
to Muhlbronner to jump and take the
chain. This he did. landing on a steep
bank, which offered only, a slight foot
hold. Lying face downward he held
to the chain and pulled the boat to
ward the bank. The boat sank in
eight feet of water. Farther back,
where there was no landing, the water
is eighteen feet deep.
By the light of a single lantern the
party escaped by climbing over Muhl
bronner's prostrate form, and, after
waiting several hours for a boat, were
brought in safety to daylight.

When Jack Cordell and Charlie
Seiger meet next Thursday night at
the Reliance^CIub, Oakland; admirers
of boxing should witness an exciting
bout. Both men have trained hard
and are reported in fine condition.
Cordell is the cleverer of the pair, but
the "Iron Man" has a terrific ' punch
and if he ever gets close enough ; to
land, the fight will stop right there.
Cordell's friends expect he will, be
able to keep Seiger at a distance and,
while they do not claim their favorite
will score a knockout, they think the
decision "will surely, go to Cordell on
points.' The men twill box fifteen
rounds, and will weigh 133 pounds ' at
6:o*c.lock. . â¢ ' "".
The main preliminary, will be a' ten
round argument between Joe; Rellly
and Danny Sullivan, " who will .meet at

be a four-round go between Henry

PERSONAL.
- INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Jan. 17.â The
United Mine Workers of America will
convene in this city to-morrow and the
convention promises to be more Inter
esting than ordinary. Within the last
two months there has apparently .been
a preconcerted move on the part of
several of the operators to cut- wages
at the rate of 10 cents a ton and a con
flict between operators and minprs
seems probable. There will be about
1000 delegates from all parts of the
country. The convention will remain in
session -for ten days and then the min
ers will enter into Joint convention with
the operators of the central competitive
field. There will be about 300 of these
operators present, ' representing West
ern Pennsylvania, Ohio', Indiana and
Illinois. This Joint" conference Is -for
the purpose of arranging a .wage scale
for the miners of the central competi
tive field.
- There are in the United States 450,000
miners, of whom 325,000 belong to the
organization. Of these there are now
14.000 on strike. Ten thousand of these
are in the West, 3000 in the Meycrsdale
district and 1000 in West Virginia.
In three 'States efforts have been
made. this year to reduce the wages of
the miners. . . The ' national officers of
the rnine workers decline to anticipate
in any way the probable action of the
convention. It. Is understood that
there is no opposition to the re-election
of. John Mitchell as president and the
other officers.

Much Important Business Will

"I can understand," he says,- "how
many people, in their anxiety for' a
canal might condone ' such a course
and' excuse the spoliation (of Colom
bia)- on the ground that it was de
manded by the progress and civiliza
tion of the world! This is precisely
the same argument with which kings
and conquerors have always justified
their wars of plunder and aggression.
I have heard it asserted that the. peo
ple of this country desire a canal and
are not particular about the methods
by which they secure it. I cannot be
lieve that this istrus of the American
people. The. Panama route is- not the
only one, nor is it the best. one.
"Let us denounce the President's.de
fiance of the law. Let us accuse ' him
for his violation of the law of nations.
I jvould retire from public life before
I Avould dishonor my State and party
by assuming tfiat they entertain other
and different sentiments."
HOUSTON, Tex., Jan. 18.â In a
signed statement given to the Post to
night Senator Bailey says that he will
"retire from public life before dishon
oring my State and party" by voting
for the ratification of the Panama
treaty.
In his statement Senator Bailey as
serts that the President's influence
was used; to , insure favorable action
toward the Panama route, as opposed
to the Nicaraguan route; that when
the Colombian Senate refused to rat
ify the treaty submitted by the United
States it was the President's duty j to
take the alternative; "but in absolute
and reckless disregard ot the impera
tive command of the law which he
himself had approved, \ the President
refused to. negotiate with Nicaragua
and Costa RicalV". 'â¢"... v
TACOMA, Wash.. Jan. 17.â The cigar
ette habit gave Miss Cassie Huntley a
thrilling experience, a severe shaking
up and several broken bones, accord
ing to the story which she told in the
Federal Court in prosecution of her
damage suit against the Canadian Pa
cifia Railroad for being hurled from a
swiftly moving train at night while a
passenger on a sleeping car bound for
Puget Sound. \}}\
Miss Huntley is suing for #7500 dam
ages,'which she claims to be due her
for carelessness on the part of the
company in not taking the proper safe
guards to prevent passengers from fall
ing off the vestibule. She testified that
she took passage on one of the com
pany's trains ten months ago from a
point in Alberta. She engaged a berth
In a tourist oar. but during the i-ight
went to the vestibule to smoke a cigar
ette. She was enjoying the aroma of
the k weed when the train suddenly
swung around a curve and she was
precipitated, from the vestibule to the
ground.
Miss Huntley arose to find herself
alone and in scant clothing several

Texas Senator Says He Would

After vainly trying to find an el do
rado of gold on the bleak shores of
Patagonia, two venturesome youths, C.
Thompson and J. McManus, gave up
the chase and landed in San Francisco
yesterday. The original party consisted
of ten members, which started out from
Halifax on March 17, 1903, on the little
schooner Hattie L. M., eighty-seven
tons burden, bound for the expected
land of gold on South America's shores,
under the guidance of Captain McLeod,
the commander of the vessel, who was
supposed to know the exact spot where
the^ treasure was to be found. During
the passage the little craft encountered
a terrible gale, which washed overboard
Ashley Cooper, who was drowned.
On arrival at Terre del Fuego the
vessel was rur# ashore and beached at
False Cove, the spot where the party
expected to pick up untold wealth. The
gold was not there.
The country was bleak and drear
and all kinds of hardships were en
countered. Finally Thompson and Mc-
Manus decided to strike out for them
selves, and heavily armed they started
down the coast. They encountered In
dians who were more or less of a sav
age type, but who for the most part
were friendly. Finally they decided to
go to Punta Arenas, and to do this
they were compelled to go in a tiny ca
noe in the open ocean for nearly 150
miles to the objective point. For nearly
a month when they were with the In
dians they lived entirely on shrimps
and clams. On November 9 the steam
er Mera hove in sight .and they took
passage on her for this port. McManus
has kept a complete diary of all the
events of the trip and has a collection
of something over 400 photographs
taken sinde he left Halifax. Notwith
standing the hardships they have en
countered the young men are in the
best of health, but have decided to
abandon any further search for riches
in that portion of the country.

ENTRIES FOR TO.-DAY.
The rain played havoc yesterday with
the plans of the association footballers.
Of the three matches for the cham
pionship of the California League none
was played. Seme of the Thistles and
Oakland Hornets were at the Presidio
Athletic ground in the morning, but
the water stood in pools on the sur
face and the match was called off.
The ground at Idora Park, Oakland,
where the Independents of Sa"n Fran
cisco we're scheduled to meet the Albion
Rovers in the afternoon, was in an
even worse condition and no match was
played.
The dryest of the three grounds was
that at Alameda, but the teams of
the Pickwicks and Occidentals were not
present in full strength and a practice
game was played Instead of the league
ntatch. The Pickwicks were aided by
Knight of the Seamen's Institute team,
as gatekeeper, artd by Gillchrest of the
Albion Rovers as outside right. The
Occidental team included Harwood of
the Vampire eleven, who acted "as goal
keeper most of the time, and T. S.
Lydon of the Thistles. G. S. K. Mc-
Callum of the Vampires acted as ref
eree. The game was productive of
some interesting play, the Pickwicks
scoring 3 goals to 0. A few spectators
watched the game from the side lines.
The teams lined up in the following po
8iticr>.s:
Pickwicks. Positions. Occidentals.
Knight Goalkeeper Harwood

There will be a. four-round contest
between George Peterson and Joe
Thomas for the welter-weight cham
pionship of the coast. Peterson holds
the title, having beaten Ted Wolfe
twice, "Rough House" McDonald,
Billy Stewart and Al Young of the
Hawthorne Athletic Club. Peterson
has trained hard for 'this contest, as
he knows Thomas is a dangerous man.
Eddie Graney will referee all the
contests.
George Murray and Bob' Lundy,
who will wear the winsed "O" to
morrow night, are the best boys in
their class. Murray meets Billy
Stewart of the United States navy and
Lundy goes against Jack Burge, the
best amateur lightweight in this city.
, Gloves will fly to-morrow night at
Mechanics* Pavilion. The cleverest
amateur boxers on the coast will com
pete in a tournament under the aus

taken a section in order to accommo
date the members of the Olympic
Club who are desirous of seeing their
champions compete against other
good men.
t>am Bergrer, who is known to his
intimates as the "Percentage Kid," is
in perfect fettle and should give
George Sullivan a hard battle. Sulli
van has been training at Joe Millet's
place near Colma and is also in fine
shape. This contest will settle the
amateur heaVy-weight championship
of the coast and the victor has a rosy
chance of representing California at
the St. Louis Exposition. Berger will
be seconded by his friend, Jimmy
Britt, "Spider" Kelly and Dewitt Van
Vourt. Van Court looks upon Berger
as the coming champion of the world.
He developed Britt and other good
men and. knows what he is talking
about. Berger owes his knowledge of
the boxing same to Van Court, who
has devoted considerable time per
fecting Sam in the game of lead and
counter.

der, without allowing any of them to
score a point against her. In the eemi
ftnal the campaigner was slipped with
Boots, which had been outfooting some
hard ones. The talent made Boots a
slight favorite, but O'Shea's dog man
aged to land the course by a score of
4 to 3.
Rasged Actor was oÂ« the card to
meet Golden Rule in the deciding course
and the wise ones figured the younger
courser an easy victor over his veteran
opponent. Two to one were the pre

The half mile may so to California.
Stanford has lost Thompson and
Smith, who figured so heavily in the
scoring last year, and unless some
crack man is developed that event,
will be lost to it. Edwards is Califor
nia's only veteran. Clifford having
graduated. Wilcox. an Oakland High;
School graduate, who did the distance
In 2:05. has come to the university.
The hardest fight will develop in the'
sprints. Cadogan is bacx In college,,
but whether he will train is something;
he himself has not determined upon. .
Abadie will take care of the 50 and'
100 yard dashes. Hughes, an Oak
land High School graduate; Davis and
Zacharias of Modesto, who all made
reputations during their "prep"
school day?, will be in these short
distance events. Stanford will have
Dunn, who won the 440-yard dash last
year; Grossman, a veteran at thÂ»
same distance, and Turpin. a good 220
and 100 vard man.
Both universities are weak in the
hurdles this year. Kuhn will not
compete and Weller. even if he goes
back to his studies, will not be able
to enter on account of his injured leg.
Against* whoever Stanford sends In
for this event California ' will have
Meany and Chaplin. There are no
freshmen in. the incoming class with
records in th'e hurdles.
The pole vault is conceded to Stan
ford. Beach. Dole and Henley all
jumped higher with the aid of the
pole than the California men did last
year and they have returned to col
lege. Opposing them will be Captain
Cooley, Wilcox and Symmes. who will
have to do a lot of practicing before
they will be able to overcome the rec
ords of the Stanford men. For the
jumps there will be Chaplain, Neigh
bor. Hickey and Cooley for California
and Henley and Beach for Stanford.
Stanford will not have Crawford,
who won first In the weights last
year, to help out the scores. Califor
nia will have Bush. Snedlgar. Forse
and Sperry. the last named a Modesto
boy, who comes to the university with,
a reputation for the hurdles and
weights.
BASEBALL MEN* AT 'WORK.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan.17.
â The first regular baseball practice of
the season was held on the varsity
diamond some days since and 4hÂ«
outlook, considering the large number
of men who turned out for the initial
warming-up, i3 encouraging. More
than thirty men, many of them fresh-Â« !
men, appeared in uniform.
Of the eleven men that played dur-Â«
ing last year's intercollegiate series*
five will be missing this year. Brown.
McGilvray, Lowenthal and Copp have
graduated or left college, whila
Parker, the varsity twirler. through
taking postgraduate work, is ineligible
on account of "having. participated in
intercollegiate contests for four years-
Crawford, star shortstop on the 1903
varsity nine, who was counted on to
strengthen the team materially this
year, has just been compelled to quit
college on account of the illness of
his father and will not return- Hi3
place will probably be filled by "Bob"
.Williams, '06, who played the position
in Crawford's absence last year.
The loss of McGilvray behind â¢â¢ tha
bat will also cripple the Stanford
nine. As an all-round player the big
catcher was one of the best in the
team, his strongest point being hi3
throwing to the bases. Captain Ball
may go in from third to resume his
old position as catcher, "which he
played in 1903. "Stump" Scott, cap
tain of the freshmen football team
and a catcher with, several years' ex
perience on the J'ultnomah nine, has
come out as a condidate for the var
sity team.
Tritch, ? 04. who pitched onÂ£ game
against California . last year, has re
turned to college and Is the leading
aspirant for pitchers' -honors. Among
others who have also a good chance
, to work into the box are Roosevelt, '04.
and Sales, '06. The loss of Parker,
the veteran twirler, will have to be
met by these men.
There are at present seven men Irl
college eligible to . lay against Berke
ley, who have played on former var
sity teams. They are Ball. -Tritch.
Trowbridge, Knight. Blake, Williams
and Wirt. Among the second team
players who have appeared on the
field are Sales. Col>â t. Weinmann.
Moore. Hudson. Howard, . Deby. and
Swinerton. MM
BERKELEY, Jan. 17.- â From pres

April. Stanford seemed to have the
best of It after the victory' of last year,
but lately California's chances have
become a little sunnier. Stanford re
tains more of her veterans, but Cali
fornia has captured the best of the
"prep" school's crop of athletes to
help offset the odds.
This is about the first year in thÂ»
history of Intercollegiate field con
tests where the talent seems equally
divided. In all other years the pre
dictions that California would win
were based on evidence that turned
out to be reliable, except, however,
last year. Even then it was conceded
that California would have won. but
for Cadogan's mishap. This year it
is different and no man can tell how
it will come out until the smoke of
battle has cleared away.
California retains Tibbetts. its best
man. for the distance events. He had
an easy time last year and may be de
pended, upon to win. Beside him,
there will be Lundy, Hackley. and
Newhall, all good runners. To com
pete against them Stanford will have
Captain Holman, Stiles and Waring

Fair Tralee , and Tralee Boy, two
greyhounds from the kennel of the
veteran coursing man, .T. J. Cronin,
carried off the honors yesterday at
Union Coursing Park. In the deciding
course of the 72-dog open stake Fair
Tralee beat his kennelmate by a score
of 4 points to 3. -" .
Tralee Boy was installed a 1 to 3
choice in the betting and barely led to
the hare by half a length in a run half
way across the field. Fair Tralee drove
in and secured the turn and then won
by the narrow margin of 1 point.
The winner is considered one of -the
fastest young greyhounds in Califor
nia, but he has been unlucky. He was
favorite for last year's Futurity, but
was injured just before the stake was
run. He beat in turn yesterday Lord
Granard. Pocatelli, Irvington Tralee,
Sea Lion, Barge, and, finally, Tralee
Boy.
Both Pocatelli and Palo Alto fell by
the wayside in the second round, the
former being beaten by the ultimate
winner and the latter by Gambit.
The most decided upset of the day
was the defeat of Renegade Apache 'by
Imperious. The former was made a
1 to 6 choice and was beaten by a score
of 9 points to 7. The results of the
day's running in detail, with Judge P.

Senator Platt, who returned from
Aiken, S. C, to-day, saj r 3 the New
York delegates will be instructed for
Mr. Roosevelt. Senator Quay, when
asked about the report, said he had
heard nothing about it.
At the same time well known Penn
sylvanians who'are in the confidence of"
the leaders say it is a fact that the-
Keystone State machine is not irrevoc
ably committed to Roosevelt, and that
if it should become clear in June that
the President ; was not available the
delegates would be free to choose some
other candidate. This is taken to mean
that the delegates will be free to follow
their inclinations. If Pennsylvania
should fail to Instruct it would be
taken as evidence that the persons
who have been struggling with Quay
to prevent him espousing the cause of
the President had made considerable
headway. '^. ', Â¦
The President's opponents declare
that if New York also should fall to in
struct it would be the end of the Roose

Mayor George .B. McCjellan for the
Presidential nomination at St. Louis.

The young woman in the case . Is
Miss Fannie Flynn. For several
years Hanson and the girl were close
friends. At one time it was generally
believed that they were engaged. This
was subsequently denied by both. At
last Hanson began to show attentions
to another girl of Manti. He ceased'
to call at the home of his former
friend and was . seen frequently in
company with his new love, to whom,
he declared, he was devotedly at
tached.
Miss Flynn did not take kindly to
the change. She was heard to re
mark that she "would get even." She
did in a. way that all but wrecked the
life of the object of, her vengeance.
Last summer the populace of Manti
was astounded by the arrest of young
Hanson on a" felony charge. His ar
rest was caused by Miss Flynn. It
was claimed by the prosecution that
at the time of the commission of the
alleged crime Miss Flynn was under
age.
Hanson was convicted and sen
tenced to one year' in the penitentiary.
A short time ago the young woman,
who had in the meantime married,
repented and told the father of the
young man her story. She acknowl
edged that jealousy had caused her to
resort to the methods she used to sep
arate him from his new sweetheart.
Steps were at once taken to pro
cure the release of young Hanson.
The case was brought to the attention
of the Board of Pardons, with the re
sult that the young man was promptly
released and restored to citizenship.

Minister Powell, finding that the Gov
ernment was unable to protect the tug
Anna, which is owned by Americans,
while entering San Isidro, requested the
commander of the United States gun
boat Newport to guard her. The revo
lutionists threatened to capture the
Anna and a strong guard left the New
port to protect her and other vessels
obliged to pass the waters in
that section of the country. A large
force of revolutionists is stationed at
San Isidro and Commander Motz goes
there prepared for all emergencies.
Minister Powell, learning of the inci
dent, promptly went to the palace and
demanded that the letters taken from
the agent be delivered to him. This
President Morales refused to do, but
Minister Powell persisted in his de
mand, saying that the Government had
no right to take such action and that
the President must hand the letters to
him. which President Morales reluct
antly did. Minister Powell also told
President Morales that the agent was
entitled to his protection, as he repre
sented an American company, and that
he < Minister Powell) would not consent
to this arbitrary act on the part of the
Government. Furthermore, the agent
could not be expelled, as wa3 threat
ened. Finally the case was satisfac
torily settled.

An incident which came near having
serious results but for the coolness and
prompt intervention of United States
Minister Ptrwell took place here on the

agent refused to comply his arrest was
ordered. In order to avoid being ar
rested the agent went aboard the New
York carrying the letters with him.
He then sent for Consul Maxwell, who
accompanied him to the palace, where
President Morales renewed his demands
and compelled the agent to give up
several letters.
