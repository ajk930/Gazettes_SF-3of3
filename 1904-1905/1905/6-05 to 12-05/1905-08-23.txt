The more the officers have investigated
the Archer case, the more firm have they
become in their belief that the missing
man has not taken his life, but has found
congenial company and has quietly slip
ped out of town on a southbound train.
Archer is fifty-five years' of age, short
in ftature, weighs 215 pounds, is" of light
complexion, has a smooth-shaven face
and when last seen wore a black suit -of
clothes and a Panama hat.
Immediately afterward Archer returned
to the hotel bar, where he addressed a
note to his wife, in which he said he
was gomg to commit suicide, and, dis
patching the message to Mrs. Archer's
rooms, I he , left the hotel. At first- Mrs.
Archer and her son were disposed to re
gard the threats in the note in the light
of a- joke, but when Archer failed to .re
turn to the hotel at a late hour,, the
mother and son became alarmed and
notified the detectives.
Returning to the hotel a trifle under
the influence of liquor. Archer was asked
by his son to. go to their apartments,
where the latter upbraided his father for
his conduct.
That Archer's inclination to enjoy him
self about town with.o ld and newly^made
friends was not pleasing to his wife is
freely admitted by Mrs. Archer and her
son. In fact it is said. that an, attempt
to* induce ' Archer tÂ« abandon convivial
friends *, and. pay i more^attetftion to 1 : his)
fam!!y-3urlng .ttielr -;' sojourn ;at thd'St
Francis .led . to \u2666 a quarrel and his leave- \u25a0
takingâ possibly his : suicide. -\u0084",". '\u25a0\u25a0-'-\u25a0',/
According to I the story told by ,young
Archer to the police and the detectives
of Morse's Agency, -who have been en
gaged in trying to find. some trace'dr the
missing man, Archer Sr., spent the better
part of Saturday about town with sev-'
eral friends, including a" member of the
police department he. had* known for
many, years. '\u25a0..
The members of the family and friends
of James Archer, until recently a guest
at the St. Francis Hotel, believe that he
has committci suicide. The local de
tectives, who have; been asked â¢ to solve
whatever mystery surrounds Archer's
strange disappearance, do not take kind
ly to the theory of suicide, but believe
that Archer has fl^d the city., after a
quarrel with his wife. The missing man
was formerly engaged in the railroad
business in Arizona and recently came
to San Francisco with his wife and son
and took apartments at the St. Francis
Hotel.
During all their married life Longmore
and his wife have never quarreled, and
when either was away from home they
never let a day pass without a letter. On
this fact mostly Mrs. Longmore bases
her idea of foul play. '.
Before leaving home and in the presence
of his wife he wrote in a small book,
which he carried in his vest pocket: "In
case of sickness or accident please notify
my wife, Mrs. T. V. Longmore, Santa
Cruz, Cal."
Longmore had expected to sell his home
In Santa Cruz, and when he left". he gave
his wife a power of attorney with the re
mark that if the people were not satisfied
with the power of attorney to telegraph
to him and he -would return and sign the
deed. A telegram was sent to him on
August 11 and returned to Mrs. Longmore
with word that he had left the city. She
then called up the New Western Hotel on
the telephone, but with the same result,
and on Thursday she made up her mind
to come to the city.
Accompanied by her three little chil
drenâMarguerite, aged eight years; Carl,
aged six, and Victor, who is only twenty
months oldâ she reached this city and was
told that her husband had paid his bill
and had left.- She then called upon sev
eral friends, none of whom had seen her
husband later than Thursday night, Au
gust 10. Charles Launner of Holbrook,
Merrill & Stetson was the last man who
saw him. He left him on Market street
Thursday night about 10 o'clock.
Longmore is 28 years of age, five feet
nine inches in height, of light complex
ion and smooth shaven. The thumb on
his right hand has been amputated at the
first joint. When last seen he ' wore a
gray mixed sack coat and striped trous
ers.
Mrs. T. V. Longmore came up from
Santa Cruz Monday in search of her hus
band, who has been missing since "August
10, and yesterday she reported to the po
lice that she suspected he had been the
victim of foul play.
Longmore and his wife owned a restau
rant in Santa Cruz, and a short while
ago he received a good offer and sold
out. He was not a man to remain idle,
so he and his wife decided to come to
San Francisco to find a location. At the
last minute, however, Mrs. Longmore
decided she could not take her children
from school, so he came without her. He
arrived here the afternoon of the 9th and
registered at the New Western Hotel on
Kearny street. The next day he wrote
to his wife thta he was not feeling well,
and if she did not hear from ' him the
r.ext day she would know that he was on
his way home. He alto telephoned to his
niece here. Miss H^ughes, but as *ho â¢ had
company she Aid-not 'see -him; -\u25a0--*_"
JThe. robber paused only long enough to
snatch a . purse from Mrs. Mize's- hand
and then fled into an alley.
Running to the -entrance of the Del
Prado, Mrs. Wilson called out to the
group on the. veranda that her compan
ion had' been killed and; then collapsed.
The police .were informed at once . and
it was not until after their arrival that
the body of Mrs. Mize. was removed. .
Mrs. Wilson did not recover . conscious-,
ness for some time after her removal
to her room, and was. so hysterical that
the police could obtain from her, no good
description of the man who- committed
the murder. \u25a0 . .... .'â¢\u25a0
Aug. 22.â When attempting
to proteit \u25a0 herself against ; the attack of
an armel robber, Mrs.. S. *E. 'Mize, a
wealthy New York woman, was shot and
killed to-night by the footpad; who fled
with her curse. Mrs. E. F.; Wilson* of
Las Cruces, N. M., who was j with ; Mrs.
Mize when the. robber accosted her, fled
to the Del Prado Hotel,. a short distance
away, where both women had been liv
ing, and gave the alarm.
Guests of the hotel, on the
broad verandas and in open windows, al
ready had heard the -shot and the
screams of the women and within 'a few
minutes scores of men; were searching the
neighborhood for the murderer. * Up to a
late hour he had not been apprehended.-
Mrs. Mize and Mrs. Wilson -had. left the
hotel fora stroll and were near the corner
of Fifty-eighth â¢ street and Washington
avenue . when . a- young;* man ; stepped ', in

While no action was. taken before ad
journment this evening, it is believed
the board will sustain Assessor Ward's
figures. San Francisco will be heard
to-morrow. ,
Supervisor Lowe claimed that from
189S t0.190.5. as shown by the assess
ment' returns, improvements In Ala
meda County, have increased $12,000,000
and improvements in San Francisco $4,
000,000. while the improvements ? in Los
Angeles County have , Increased $33,
000.000. He said that in 1904 L 93 An
geles Issued $12,000,000 in building per
mits and San Francisco $15,000,000.
Dodge objected to the comparisons
made with San Francisco, declaring
that Lowe's figures took In the twenty
two Incorporated cities and towns in
cluded in Los Angeles' County, while
the San Francisco figures stood for
that city alone.. Supervisor Lowe said
Assessor Ward had made an * assess
ment which was higher than conditions
justified. Dodge said the Los Ansreles
Assessor had failed to assess local ser
vice corporations, which in San Fran
cisco x he (Dodge) had assessed $20,000.
000. Dodge said he had not brought
evidence against LO3 Angeles, but was
prepared to combat any unjust com
parisons. ,
Dodge said when he" heard Los An
geles representatives were In San Fran
cisco securing, data on assessments he
went to Los Angeles for a similar pur
pose. He had applied various- tests and
discovered, that In Los Angeles property
was assessed only at 35 per cent of its
selling value, while in San Francisco
the assessment is 65 per cent.' On Mar
ket street, San Francisco, the assess
ment of the Blythe block is $5230 a
front foot, as against $1400 a foot on
Spring street. Los Angeles.

Dr.- Washington Dodge. Assessor of San
Francisco, was present and engaged in
a lively discussion relative totfte com
parative assessment of San Francisco
and Los Angeles.
Dodge had come to Sacramento to be
present .at "the hearing to-morrow
asked for by the real estate' board of
San .Francisco , for' the^purpose of de
fending the valuations he had placed
on property in the metropolis " against
criticism. by the real estate men.- ,
*.." Chairman Lonrden of the Board of

DENVER, Colo.. Aug. 22.â Judge

to-day removed Henry M. Beatty as
assignee of the Western State Bank,
and named the Continental Trust Com
pany to act instead. The trust com
pany immediately filed bonds in . the
gum of J1.395.000.
The reason given by Judge "Williams
for his action is that Beatty Is; a de

the bank officers and that, as cashier,
Beatty paid to the local aerie of
Eagles- money which it had on deposit
after the bank had closed its doors,
thereby d.oing an injustice to other de

made for the small speck in the distance.
When It was reached, the , crew found
two uncon6cious forms lying -in the boat.
When Miss Stewart and her fiance were
taken on the launch, both were breath
ing and were soon resuscitated. Up to
a late hour to-night neither had revived

CHICAGO, Aug.- 22.â The missing couple,
Miss Zelda Stewart and. her fiance, John
Chartres, both - alive, were found togeth
er in an open boat, forty miles out in
Lake Michigan late this afternoon. Both
were almost famished. They had been
without food or water to drink, except
what they had scooped up in their hands
from the lake, for fory hours. . ;
The couple left in a rowboat from the
foot of Montrose boulevard at 10- o'clock
on Sunday night for a boat ride on the
lake. When information of their discov
ery was first received, It was 'reported
that both were dead. Later information
came to Ethelbert Stewart, the father
of the girl, that both were alive and had
reached the eight-mile landing oft the
mounth of Chicago harbor.
Some of the country towns are seek
ing to avoid a clash with the State
lioard of Health in the matter of quar
antine in a way calculated to do injury
to New Orleans. Lake Charles is an
instance. The fever scare there is so
great that the people refuse to receive
any freight whatever from here.
Mayor Dehrmun's office is over
whelmed with letters, many from
cranks, but others from well-meaning
persons who offer specifics against yel
low fever. The Mayor's reply to these
communications is that the fever is
being fought here on the principle that
It can alone be transmitted by means
of the mosGulto.
In s;>ite of all the agitation there has
been on the subject some cisterns still
remain unscreened and the police have
received orders to s^are no one who
shows an indisposition to obey the law.'
Failure to screen caused Hart Newman,
lormer president of the New Orleans
liaseball Club, and a son of Isidor
Newmiiii. the millionaire banker, to
spend a brief time in Jail to-day. New
man is at the head of the company that
owns Athletic Park. Some one discov
ered that th*-re were three unscreened
cisterns on the grounds and made an
affidavit against him. He was arrested
Mild locked up. He was released by In
spector Whitaker. Newman was indig
nant at liis arrost. He said he made
large contributions to the fever fund
and had paid to screen a large number
of cisterns that he did not own in his
yard and had simply forgotten the cis
terns at the park.
The deaths again to-day were prin
cipally of persons bearing foreign
names. An exemption was. Arthur Hill,
an employe of one of the large dry
good houses. Hill came here last No
vember from New York with his wife
and uu children.

were not seriously menaced.. At ojfl?,
time the only water . to be. had w#S
ocean brine, which had been boiled and
condensed. One swallow a day ' 'to
each person was all this process, fur
nished.
On August 8 the disabled vessel
sighted the Adirondack and sigrfaled
"All we'l on board." On August 10
the last tank of water was opened and
was found to be- tainted with the juice
of the bananas. Sonic dolphins were
caught two days later, and on August
13 the famine was further relieved by
the steamship Montevideo, whic>i sup
plied provisions.
For nearly a week, between August
10 and August 17, the engine's shaft
was useless, and not only was the
Athos forced to drift about while, re
pairs were under way. but for two
days of this period high seas broke
over the helpless steamship.
Finally, on August 18, the coupling
flange broke, and the Athos abandoned,
all attempts. to reach New York und-jr
her own steam, after twenty days* of
continuous accidents. It was de-'l.lt'd
to accept the offer of a tow. This did
not come for two days, during which, a
second food famine was averted by the
steamship Vera, which came alongside'
the Athos and supplied eatables and
drinkables. Worse even than the dan'
gers of the sea and famine, the passen
gers say, was the odor of the decayed
banana cargo.
NEW YORK. Aug. 22. â The steamship
Athos, seventeen days late, with eight
passengers and a cargo of" ' 'decayed
bananas, and the bones of naif Â»m ten
sharics on board to indicate the perils
of her voyage, arrived off Scotland
lightship last night.
On July 3 the Donald Steamship CJin
peny's steamship Athos left Port An
tonio, Jamaica, for Xew York, a 'six
Cays' voyage. Three hours cut of port
an eccentric rod on the engine broke,
and from that hour until last Sunday,
pioceeding sometimes only an hour a
Cay under, her own steam, the At!ioa
drifted at the mercy of the storms, in
coiiytaat danger of famine, once wlrh
put drmking water, and receiving .sjp
.plleis from' time to time from passing
vessels, until August 20, when th.c dis
abled steamship gave up and signaled
the steamer Altai for a tow. The Al
tai brought the Athos to New Yor'c.
From July 30 to August 7 one ' to
two breaks daily In the engine were re
corded. On August 7 the catching of
sharks i-.= recorded. The Chinese on
board attempted to eat the sharks, but
the meat made them 111 and the fish
were thrown into the sea.
In connection with the appointment the
name of Francis ,B. Loomis, Assistant
Secretary of State, has been mentioned,
but it can be said definitely that Loomis
will not be appointed. His resignation
as Assistant Secretary of State may be
expected at any time. It Is certain that
he is to retire from the State Department,
but whether he will receive an appoint
ment' In \u25a0 the diDlomatic -service, as has
been suggested, is problematical.
OYSTER BAY. Aug. 22.â Edwin Â»H.
Conger of lowa has resigned:^ his post . as
Embassador to Mexico,'" to take effect on
October IS next, and President ; Roosevelt
has accepted the- resignation. "" Conger's
retirement from the diplomatic j service

he might be sent to Peking as a special
commissioner of the President to adjust,
if possible, the differences -which ; have
arisen between 'this country: and- Chirra
over the boycott of American goods by
some Chinese commercial "guilds,*: but' as
no official statement is obtainable here

CHRISTIANIA, Aug. 22.â The Storthing
to-day adopted, by a vote of 104. t0 11. tha
proposals of the Government for the for^
mal opening of negotiations with ; Sweden
for the dissolution of the union. "'- >
The passage iof the resolution was not
pocured- without*. obstinate resistance on
ths part of "the Radical and Social fac-|
tions, whose programme is to prevent ne
gotiations - with Sweden. The crushing
majority for the. Government, however,
shows that the Storthing and the people
are anxious ; for an amicable settlement.
The Government is Urcnly opposed to any
change in the j proposals, evidently wish
ing, to meet the, Riksdag half-way.-' ; 3
I The committee on negotiations probably
will be appointed at once,- and will con
sist of Foreign : Minister Loveland, C. 1 C.
Berner,. President of the Storthing, and
former Minister, of {the Interior Vogt.
It is; believed in: authoritative circles
that Sweden . is Â» now inclined to concede
the candidacy of Prince Befnadotte.
STOCKHOLM, Aug. 22.â The members
of the Cabinet are not willing to express
an opinion until- the' full report of the ac
tion of the Swedish . Storthing Is received.
A prominent member, however, said to
day: ." '
It appears that the Storthing's, decision em
braces the approval 'of the -primary principles
on which the Riksdag founded Its action.' We
understand-that* the' Storthing's decision coin
cides with the view held .by the Riksdag that
negotlaitons on the- principal conditions shall
precede the Riksdag's consent to a dissolution
of I the union. - The broad" lines of settlement
once . reached, however, there la every reason
to -hop 'for a" satisfactory, solution.'

There: was .an apparently wide differ

down to-day on the foreign immigration

however, being brought back to her anchorage,

later. \u25a0 . â¢* _.-â¢*--â¢
A Fhelter was built on the shore and mem
bers of the expedition* were kept busy during
the winter preparing for the spring sledge Jour
ney and in scientific work, which was retarded
by severe storms.
The first sledge party left March 7, 1904, but
was compelled to return, owing, to injuries re
ceived by several -of - the men after - reaching
Cape Flfngeley." A second ' attempt wm made
on March 25. The. sledges were again smashed
when a short distance from land. * Leaving a
small ' party at the base, I returned to Cape
Flora, the trip occupying sixteen days.
Relief failing to arrive. ln\ September,. 1904.
I. accompanied by William J. Peters of the
United States Geological Survey and a email
sledge party,' started back to the base, which
was reached November 22, 1901, after a most
eventful and dangerous trip, rough ice having
to be crossed; in dense darkness and the men
and "dogs fairing into holes and crevices and
running against walls of ice. .Crossing Hooker
Island two of the men fell- Into a crevice for
a distance of sixty-five feet and were, wedged
between walls of -Ice. Their rescue was at
tended with the greatest dlfflcutly. one being
so severely injured that he had to be lashed
to the sledge.
With the exception of a Norwegian fireman,'
who had died, .we found all the party atths
base in good health, ana preparations were
again begun for another sledge trip to the
northward.
The weather delayed the party until March
IC, 1905.- On this day the party left the ba.Â«e,
which was named Cape Anruzzl, - for the Ice
pac,k to the north. Crossing a glacier east uf
Cape Wrath, we forced a way to the northward,
but our progress was slow, the ice being rough
and the men having to first cut a â¢ way and
then to assist the teams over the rough road.
High temperatures and foga also helped to de
lay our progress. For two days and three
nights we were in a temperature of. 34 de
gress above zero, when it should have been be
low zero, and the Ice was constantly cracking
under the tents. Under these conditions and
with the pressing need for the sending of sup
plies to the party at Cape Flora, together with
my poverty In dogs, I decided to return.
The conaitlons on the southward trip were
worse than on the northward one.' but a for
tunate drop in the' temperature enabled us to
cross a network of open lanes and we reached
Cape ' Abruzzl April ; 1. Mr.' Porter, third in
command of. tho expedition, -was sent south ta
explore the. archipelago, while the rest of the
party worked at the moving of stores tenth of
Cape Zlegler, making provision -In cas*Â«~we
should be compelled to epÂ«nd a third winter In
the Arctic. In the meantime the. scientific
work continued without interruption.
.On July 30 news came of the arrival or thÂ«
relief expedition, and -we made a trip of more
than twenty miles on rotten Ice to Join the
Terra Nova. , !â¢ .^;;

MANILA.' Aug. 22.â What appears to
be a well-authenticated instance of the
cure of leprosy has occurred here. A
few weeks ago a patient, who had .been
afflicted with leprosy and who had been
under treatment for that disease, died
of liver complaint. After the patient's
death every part of the body was sub
jected to a searching microscopical ex
amination by bacteriologists, but not the
slightest trace of leprosy could be
found. . .:. j

who treated the patient for leprosy. He

The correspondent asserts that both

says, will pay Japan a sum in the guise
of expenses for the maintenance of

be divided, Russia retaining the north

Japan will abandon her claims as to the
interned warships and the limitation
of Russia's naval force in the Pacific.

real hope for peace and that the Jap
anese are ready to arrange a settle-_
ment in a way that will save Russian
dignity and honor. Apparently, says
the correspondent, the basis of this set
tlement-is the retention by Russia, of
a portion of the Island of Saghallen,
in consideration of a payment of money
in lieu of indemnity.

Witte and Barop Rosen is believed to
have been â¢ the result of his interview
yesterday at Oyster Bay with Baron Ka
neko. who had acted as the President's
medium of communication with the Tokio
Government.. i .-" \ ." *._ â¢ \ .....

Coast-points and Vladivostok; ;
WILL IT HATCH?
It was the President's message to Mr.
CÂ« Wltte which caused the sensation of
" the day. Early In the morning had come
the official announcement that the meet
ing of the conference which was to have
t>een held to-day had been postponed un
til to-morrow. The public reason assigned
Vras that the protocols for submission at
â¢'the Bitting had not been completed. But
a few hours later the true reason leaked
9&t. J. L. McGrew, one of the stenogra
phers attached to the executive office at
O>*6ter Bay, had arrived with a commu
nication from the President 'for the Rus
eion plenipotentiaries. Mr. de Wltte and
Baron Rosen had left the hotel, ostensi
bly for a ride in an automobile to Tork
Beach, but ipstead had quietly slipped
over to the conference building at . the
navy yard to receive the message -from
Assistant Secretary Peirce. .
For three hours Mr. de Wltte and Baron
RoFcn remained at the conference build
ing with Mr. Pelrce. Then Mr. McGrew
hastened Â«. back to Oyster Bay.
â¢ Mr. Roosevelt's message :to Mr. de
Tersely stated, it consists in an agree
ment by Russia to repurchase possession
Of either all or one-half of the island
of Baghalien, now in the military occu
pation of Japan, for a sum the . amount
of which, if the two countries cannot
agree, ehall be decided by some method
of arbitration hereafter to be determined.
Th<Â» purchase money, together with the
Bum Japan would obtain from the ces-
Blon of the Chinese Eastern Railroad and
the maintenance of the Russian prisoners
In Japan, would, it is estimated, about
Â«qual the amount claimed by Japan as
her bill for the cost of the war.
Practically, therefore the solution of
fered by the President involves recession
by Janan upon article 5 (the cession of
Baghalien) and recession by Russia upon
article 9 (Indemnity). It seems practi
cally certain, though this cannot be
affirmed positively, that the President
to-day was able to give Mr. de Wltte
substantial assurance that Japan would
be willing to accept such a compromise.
This Is apparently supported by the au
thoritative Japanese statement made to
night in reply to a question as to whether
Japan had not decided to make substan
tial concessions:
"It all depends upon Russia."
SEM3S EXVOY TO DE WITTE.
President Roosevelt's suggestion for
breaking the existing deadlock in the
peace negotiations and rescuing the con
ference from failure "was designed to per
mit the satisfaction of the Japanese de
mands for reimbursement for the cost of
the war and at the same time enable
Russia to face the world with, the
declarations that she had not ceded a
foot of territory or paid a kopeck of
\u25a0war tribute to the victor.
No confirmation of the report that Rus
sia's reply is negative can be obtained,
and it must be accepted with all reserve.
The lights in the rooms of M. de Witte
end Baron Rosen were burning long after
midnight.

NEW YORK,, Aug. 22.-For several

an elephant hunt. . *
Breaking their chains, . in rear of Louis

trotted to| the tall grass , and timber,
which overgrow several plats of ground,
the owners of , which . have not had the
land! cleared In years.
â¢.Trumpeting;; wildly as they ran, the
elephants frightened several automobile
parties, and sent not a few horses off
the road before they reached barren
land. It was .dark before Ruhe rounded
up several .trainers and provided them
with mounts. These men were accom
panied .by^ a force on foot, numbering
hundreds. At the head of the pursuing
party, was. a armed with a pike.
His attendants' had everything, from a
crowbar to a howitzer.
The;, elephants were feeding quietly
when .the grove was surrounded. One
small boy ventured to penetrate the
jungle and report. He did this by climb
ing a tree.
;.- A council of war had j decided it was
best to rush/ the thicket! .when the ele
phants, â¢ scenting the. presence of; their
keepers, dashed in a. body from their
cover. All foot records on Long Island
were. broken. Old men who have hobbled

was Brigadier General Charles "Wright
Miner, U. S. A., retired, who is named as
co-respondent and who is accused by Ma
jor Taggart of having maliciously im
prisoned him at Fort Leavenworth.
General Miner was accompanied. by hla
i wife. He was not called to the stand un
til late this' afternoon. ' He was asked
about the famous dinner. party, at . which
thÂ« alleged impropriety l between himself
and Mrs;- Taggart took place. General
Miner said he sat at the head of the
table, which â¢ was â¢ fifty-four inches wide,
and that It would have been Impossible
for him .to take improper liberties with
Mrs. Taggart. He said he had called to
see Mrs. Taggart on one occasion only,
and that was to deliver a message from
his (General Miner's) wife. - Thla took
twenty minutes, "he sald.-He denied that
he had ever gone out: the. back door of
the Taggart home or any other back door
except his own. He denied having gone
to see Mrs. Taggart when her' husband
had been detailed- on flood duty in' May,
1903, In Kansas City.
General .Miner denied in toto. upon
questioning by ; Smyser, any Indiscretions
whatever with Mrs. Taggart. as charged
in the amended petition of Captain Tag

scene at Fort Eeavenworth, when he had
Captain Taggart 1 ; before him on the day
after the trouble : occurred between : Cap
tain and Mrs.; Taggart. Captain Poore
had officially reported the affair to him,
he said. When he asked Taggart about
It, the captain said he. must have been
crazy, and spoke of Mrs. Taggart being
"as white as, the driven snow," and called
upon God as his witness that he had
never struck his. wife before. â¢ .
General j Miner J said ' he did not prefer
charges against Taggart'. at the court
martial. He went to the Taggaxts" home,
and Mrs. Taggart pleaded with' him,"" for
the sake of the children, not to prefer
charges.
. Upon cross-examination General Miner
said he, did not [consider himself, a mem
, ber of Governor" Herrick's : staffs He said
he considered : Captain .Taggart a good
officer. Mrs. , Tagffart , had , asked him to
order the captain .not to . communicate
with her. 'for" three months, but""- he con

did not do-so.V-V-^7v"jM,.'c V'-.-l *â¢ . ".'.
General Miner was j shown a â¢ letter he

Taggart and had*, failed- to., mention the
good things Taggart had done. He said

It is a serious thing to neglect â¢
your heart. - .' \" "
The moment yoti detect any
weakness or irregularity, such
as. short- breath after exercise,
palpitation/ fluttering, weak or
hungry spells, . pain in breast,
side or shoulder, or uneasiness â¢
when lying on leff side, you
should take Dr. Miles' , Heart ,
Cure; it rarely ever fails to
relieve all these symptoms.
If . not promptly restoredi
chronic heart disease soon .de-
velops, and then it only remains
for some sudden strain to com-
. . pletely exhaust the . heart.
Thousands of hopeless cases
have been cured, and if you do 'â¢â¢;
not try it, it will be the great-
est mistake of your life.
'"When I began taktej T)il Miles* ~
Remedies I was in a very bad condi-
tion. I had stomach trouble, with
severe distress after eattnr. My heart .
hurt me, and I had shortness of
breath, palpitation. My pulsa was
Irregular, and my feet, ankles and
hands' were swollen. Every month
at regular, periods I had severe pain. .
I wrote Dr. Miles' Medical Co.. and
they advised me to take Dr. Miles'.
Restorative Nervine and Heart Curs.'
I soon noticed an Improvement, and I
continued the i medicine until X . was
completely cured. I feel like a dlf- â¢,
ferent person. In fact I have not felt
so well for 20 years."

They .'_ stated that the bills had Keen

OAKLAND,- Aug." 22.â The Grand Jury

BERKELEY. Aug. 22.â One of the
most cherished traditions at the Univer
sity of California was given a body blow
to-day by President Wheeler. Professor
Cory and Captain Nance, when a delega
tion of prominent seniors and juniors
was called into President Wheeler's office
and there informed that there must be
no hazing of freshmen during the mili
tary drill to-morrow morning.
Captain Nance, who went through riots,
insubordination and turmoil generally
last year, until one prominent senior was
suspended and a score were put on pro
bation, proposes to preserve perfect dis
cipline from the start, and President
Wheeler, in the opinion of the students
who talked with him to-day, is deter
mined to back the captain up.
Each year hitherto the occasion of the
first military drill by freshmen has been
improved by seniors and juniors to thor
oughly hare and "rough house" the un
fortunate "freshies." While the freshmen
stood in line, most of them awkward and
ill at ease, bands â¢of â¢ predatory seniors
would sweep down upon them, with arms
locked and line compact, carrying with
them a bunch of freshmen, and an occa
sional sophomore. Discipline was never
preserved, the officers agreeing that on
this particular day the freshmen might
as well get their "medicine."
Now It will be different. Captain Nance
demands perfect order to-morrow. The
delegation which was called before Presi
dent Wheeler promised to do the best
that could be done to preserve order, and
the men were warned that failure to do
bo would be charged up to them as repre
sentative leaders of their classes.
The students who conferred with Presi
dent Wheeler include the following men:
Coogan. Drescher, Andrews, Kennedy,
Cooper. Dickie, Elliott. Bohnett, Encell,
Rust, de LeeÂ», Eherman, Rankin,
Fletcher. Stern, Davis, Gabbert, Wayne,
Vollmer and Gordon.

She is herself an excellent musician.
OAKLAND. Auk. 22.â The homo of Miss
Margie Webber was the Ecene of a pleasant
gathering of musical people last evening, and
for several reason? was unusually lnterestingl
In the first place, Â±"rofessor C. F. Stalner of
San Francisco read, for the first time, the li
bretto of an opera he has written. Then that
wonderful child pianiEt, little 9-year-old Phlll
da Ashley, was beard in several difficult and
well rendered seections, and, last but by no
means least, the young hostess sang â sang
right into the hearts of every one there. Mise
Webber is the young eoprano in whom Etelka
Gerster is manifesting great interest and on
the 31st she leaves Oakland to Join the great
artiste in New York. Madame Gerster and
Geoxg Henschel of London will have charge of
the vocal department of the new school of
muEical art In .New York, of; which._F/anfc
Damrosch 'is director, anc Mies Webber wifl
remain there -as a student until Gerster re
turns to Europe next March, when she will also
go to Berlin to begin, under the diva's direc
tion, an operatic career. ' \u25a0â¢ â¢ â
Last night, one of the numbers that Miss
Webber Bang "was the aria from "The Mar
riage of Figaro," cf which Sembrich, in the
A v trust Etude, says: "I see when I speak of
difficulties, a passage cantilena â adagio, soste
nutoâone note succeeding another, to be sung
perfectly even. No agility, no pyrotechnics.
Nothing but the breath in control, the power
to sustain. She who can do that is an artist!"
Seven years ago Madame Gerster gave Ml sis
Webber permission to sing this aria of Su
zanne's in public! Miss Webber certainly has
wonderful breath control, tnat leaves her free
to do as she wills with the exquisite lyric
notes that are her heritage and that fall de
llclously on- the ear like rounded . pearls of har
mony. Since Miss Webber's return from Ber
lin fix years ago she has worked alone, and
what she has accomplished shows what the
American girl can do when talent goes hand
in hand with intelligence and perseverance.
At a concert given recently by Miss Webber
he: 1 first number^was Eva del'Acqua's superb
"Vlllanelle" and. In strong contrast, her clos
ing song was 'â¢Still As the Night." showing a
versatility and dramatic force that surprised
even her warmest admirers.
Among others who contributed to last night's
programme were Mrs. Blanche Ashley^
of San Francisco, Mr. Richards of London
and Mr*. Jessie Brock Morgan, who sang two
duets wifti Miss Webberâ â¢ "I Waited On the
Lord." by Mendelssohn, ana a selection from
\u25a0â¢Figaro."

The officers of the- Lumber Dealers-Ass

refuse to say what' action will be taken
if their offer "to compromise is refused.
George H:- Payne of the Lumber Deal

Th'er's .has been no change in our position.
We Infov -cii the tallymen- when they demanded

members of these unions are not anxious

HALFMOON BAY, Aug. 22.-The in
credulous bnes N ,who doubted, because they
saw no active; building operations in this ' *,
city, that the Ocean Shore Railroad waa
to "be any different from its predecessors,
but was' to remain simply a promise with.
out fulfillment;:. have, been reassured by
the "positive assertion of Alfred D. Bowen^
president of the' road, that
work will ' commence . In Halfmoon Ba7
late in the 'fall or early In the winter.
In explanation- of this apparent delay
the â¢ president â¢ says rit- i 3 the purpose ci
the company" to finish grading'the largest
part of â¢ the. road before- commencing ta
lay -ties 'and rails. It Is expected that
the . grading - will be . over with at thÂ»
stipulated time.; It. was at first intended
to use electric locomotives on tho road,
but It has been deemed advisable by thÂ«
experts to substitute the side, trolley ay**
tern. During the day passenger train*
will be operated exclusively and at night
electric freight trains will convey tisa '
produce of the district to the markets of
San Francisco.
In connection with to-morrow's confer
ence will be considered the question of
purchase, with or without condemnation
suit, of the portion of partly water-cov
ered land east of Fallon str<#t along the
Twelfth gtreet darn as far as Kendall's
boathous*. owned by the Edson Adams
estate. This tract covers six acres, and
according to the engineer's survey of 1900
is outside of the -original Lake Merritt
lines, although it is partly submerged at
*high tide.
There is also in hand a proposal to open
Thirteenth street on a curve east from
Fallon street to Twelfth street, making
an easy connection between the drive
across Twelfth street and Thirteenth
street as opened now to Fallon. As ex
pressed by the Mayor, the chief purpose
of the conference is to press forward the
preliminaries toward the inauguration of
work on the general improvements that
are contemplated, to make tne Lake Mer
ritt water park and the adjacent lands
one of the show places of the city.
Mayor Mott said to-day he favored an
amicable adjustment of private interests
where they did not materially encroach
on the original lines of the lake. This
refers particularly to lands along the
northwest shore, which passed years ago
from the original claimants to third par
ties and where â¢ very extensive improve
ments exiFt. But the settlement of the
city's claim to title in filled lands at the
northeastern arm of the lake will be
giv^n special consideration, as a consid
erable tract of reclaimed property is in
volved. There are also some pieces along
Lake Shore avenue to which' attention
will be given.
The purpose of the conference is to out
line a plan for the Immediate prosecution
of the improvements* It is expected that
the various collateral questions touching
the lines of the lake, the interests of pri
vate ownership along the lake shore, the
general scope of the projict and the set
tling of minor disputes will all be handled
and put in shape for definite action at
once.
OAKLAND. Aug. 22.â Mayor Mott has
called a joint meeting of the Board of
Public Works, the City Council and the
citizens' advisory committee for to-mor
row afternoon at 4 o'clock to confer on
the projected improvement of Lake Mer
ritt and the parking of the lands south
of Twelfth street dam.
Then she ordered him to jail, declaring
that he had offended before and must
expect to take the consequences of his
wrongdoing. The culprit pleaded in vain
and was sent off to jait.
Mrs. Seig has not sworn to r a com
plaint against her brother and he is
therefore being held in detention until
a decision is reached. Fromme Is silent
concerning his .troubles.
The noise from breaking glass aroused
Mrs. Seig last night and she sent a
hurry-up call for the police. Patrolman

of .the. house two broken panes of window
glass were found* and inside was evidence
of the burglar's visit. The rooms had

BERKELEY, Aug." 22;â A woman foot
pad is the lat,est novelty , that the police
of Berkeley â have to, deal, with' For three j
days the deputies ; linder Marshal Voll
mer have been searching' for Clara Stikes,
a colored woman, â¢whd held' up Thomas
Drtscoll at Addlson'and' Fourth streets,
invest Berkeley, last Sunday night and
secured from . him J220. . ; â¢
The woman is said to have held a re- i
volver to the head of Driscoll and forced
him to give up all the coin^in his posses
sion. He reported the matter to 'the po
lice, but the news of the affair was not
made public until, to-day. Driscoll resides
at the Franklin Hotel in West Berkeley.
Another report has been made to the
police of the woman footpad's operations, j
this, time by John Downey, who Is \ a
guest at the Acheson Hotel in Berkeley.-
Downey reported having been robbed by !
the Stikes woman of $15. . '
; Each of the woman's victims was able
to give an excellent, description of the j
"highway woman," and the police soon
learned her identity. A clew was found j
which led the officers to the home of a
colored family named Clark at 2112 Fifth
street, in West Berkeley.^ They went to
this place and inquired for the Stikes
woman. The Clark's threw-the officers off
the scent for a few moments and man
aged at the same time to convey warning
to Clara Stikes, who was in the house at
the time. The footpad "lady" ' escaped
through a rear door, and has since been
in hiding. Descriptions of her have been
sent out- by the police to the officers of
neighboring cities, and it is confidently
expected that she . will soon be in the
toils. v .". ' ."- : \u25a0

Greany came here from Honolulu
about a year ago arid' alleges in- the
complaint that he was induced to in
vest $2000 In the company's stock by
Rauhut on the representations that
Rauhut h&d invested $20,000 cash and
K. H. Vesper $5000 cash in the com
pany, which was its working capital;
that there was a surplus of $2000 over
the Indebtedness; that the merchandise
liabilities were not in excess of $5000
and were fully balanced by accounts
receivable and that the stock in hand
was worth over $30,000.
Greany alleges that all of these rep
resentations were false, which .he
learned after he had been appointed
bookkeeper for the company. He says
he has repeatedly made a demand upon
Rauhut for the return of the $2000, but
without success. He makes other
charges against Rauhut, which he says
he will be able to prove when the case
comes on for trial.

House, obtained a warrant from Police

suggested the [ result -that would :' ensue in
this country were the States deprived of
their Individual government 5 and .the af
fairs of the North;. South, East and West,

"Let your Federal government deprive

â¢ Discussing /,the ;' long .and 'J persistent
struggle of the Irish people for. home rule
Mr. , Redmond . \u25a0 â¢ Â» yesterday ,- expressed g'a
hopeful view ' of the situation, and { added
, that the . demands of the Irish'; to-day are
exactly j the same as in , the time of Glad
stone , and Parnell. " -\u25a0: ;, v ; ; - ,
'"We \u25a0â¢\u25a0 demand * the \u25a0 . of _the

â¢'Some years ago it seemed that all \ but
the Irish . were disposed to regard our /de
mands in the light of unreasonable prop
ositions, and \ many;' l dare say, thought

that the / great - masses of \u25a0'- Scotland and
Wales, and even the . people of .England,
consider our cause :! just and : even â¢ neces
sary, for the welfare of the entire; British
empire, and particularly, desirable* from
the Scotch and Welsh' point of view,*; in
that home rule for Ireland -means relief
for the British Parliament, f which.' will
then be able to devote j more I needed at

GREAT DISCOVERY
Core Found for Bright's Diseaseâ ln- â¢
vestigation Made by Member of
Chattanooga News Staff.
Cbattanooga (Term.) "Dally News," Aug. 10.
A representative of the "News" has
just returned after a very successful
vl*lt to California.
Concerning the printed reports that
the long-sought cure for Brfght's Dis-
ease has been discovered in San Fran-
cisco he took special pains to. find out
the truth of the matter. He saw sev- ,
era! personally who had recovered and'
so much documentary evidence that he
comes back fully convinced that the
disease is not only curable, but that a
large majority of all cases recover. If
he hadn't seen the parties themselves
the stories they told him would" have,
sounded like a yellow back novel, they ;
seemed so impossible.
One lady, the wife of a San Francisco
editor, not only told, him of ; her hus-
band's remarkable recovery after phy-
sicians had given him up, but she reeled
off as of no moment the names of sev-
eral others they told of it who had. re-
covered. One case was particularly in-
teresting. It was a case, of Bright's
Disease in which the young man was so
impressed that nothing could be done
that. he. had to be tricked into taking
the new specific. Each time a dose was
administered a tablespoonful of his old
medicine was secretly disposed of, thus
lowering the bottle that stood onrthe
table at the head of the bed and allaying
suspicions. To complicate matters, as |
the y^ung man recovered the physician
became elated, thinking, that he;. had
discovered a cure for Bright's Disease.
It was not until the patient was so well
along toward recovery that there : was
no uncertainty about It that the whole
plot was disclosed. - dOftiBfIPNBBSMMPtf
Dr. Ziele, one- of San Francisco's
pioneers, also confirmed his . o,wn recov- ,
cry and made the astonishing statement
that he had given it; to between 'forty,
and fifty and only knew of a- few, fall t,

"Dave Barry need not worry about
me not doing iiB pounds," said Tommy
Burns yesterday at tils training quar
ters at Han Rafael. "I will be at
weight all right, no matter what they
say about me having lots of trouble
in doing: it. T*>ll Barry not to worry
about my weight."
Tommy had just finished an eijrht
mile Kpin on the road and the per
spiration was running down his sun
burned fare as he spoke. ...The -cold
look Burns gives . his listeners in-- a
sort of sidewise fashion ehows.heis In
earnest. He srioke of the fine. weather
he had to work in, of Barry's " great
grameness and how hard he could hit
with his right hand.
Barry still continues his training at
Alameda. and yesterday his work
brought him to within three and a half
pounds of the required weight. - Some
evening next week the two mid
dle weights will meet to agree upon a
referee. .

DETROIT MEN-OBJECT
AND FORFEIT GAME
Bat, Manager Nolan, Brother Charlie,
Jimmie Gardner and his brother George,
Joe Angeli, Kentfield Scott and others
warmed the road between here, and San
Anselmo to-day at a good jog. Thepace
was too stiff for Nolan and Charlie Nel
son and a few others and they gradually
dropped away in the, rear.
. The weather was a trifle cool, but ; Nel
son came in with .'. beads of perspiration
exuding from' every pore. Martin Murphy,
the well-known fighter of 1 years f gone -by
and trainer, took charge of Nelson ; and
gave him, a good rub down: and bath.
After luncheon he perused the papers
and wrote a couple of notes. ; He: spent
forty- five minutes in . the ] gymnasium .in
the afternoon, : opening every window ; in
order to have plenty .of - air passing
through the room; He punched. the sand
bag. had the punching bag beatings a,
lively tattoo on ' the platform^, gave a the
wrist "machine several turns and skipped
rope.i doing some fancy, work. The'spec
tators enjoyed the three :. three-minute
rounds which took â¢< place between . Bat
and Joe An cell. The . bout "concluded
Bat's gymnasium for the day. -r This even
ing,' in company, with Nolan and a friend,'
he had ' his half -hour : row over 1 the . two
mile course of :\u25a0 the' Escalle' Yacht Club. ;'i"
Nelson, retires' at 9 and peacefully,
slumbers until ' 7, . when he arrives and
breakfasts at 7 :30. -â¢VraSM
LARKSPUR, Aug. 22.-â Battling Nel
son looked well this evening after his
hard day's work. The only matter which
seemed to disturb him. was the non
appearance of his bag-punching bull ter-i
rler "Mike." -The mascot was lost on
the county road between here and San
Anselmo yesterday. "Mike" occupies the
closest spot to Bat's heart and no money
could persuade Bat to part with him. He
has frequently had admirers of the won
derful canine mascot ask him to place
a price on him, but he would always
reply: "lie is not for sale." !
Not hearing any news of "Mike" from
the lately enrolled army, of dog catchers
in Ross Valley, he finished his gymnas
ium work an hour earlier to-day in order
to search the valley on horseback before
dark. He galloped rapidly \a way until
he reached the spot where' he thinks
Mike was lost. He went over the terri
tory closely, making : numerous Inquiries;
but without success. It is probable some
covetous admirer of the canine has cap
tured the dog and will try. to get out of
thecounty with him.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 22.â
James Lanagan, head coach.of the Stan
ford football squad, received a tele
gram from W. H. Dole to-day to the
effect that the renowned player would
not return to college to enter the ranks
of the cardinal eleven. Lanagan, how
ever, had the consolation of welcom
ing A. J. Chalmers, who was not ex
pected to be back. The loss of the vet
eran punter and star halfback has been
the source of much anxiety, but the
fact that the man who made ill the
touchdowns in the pame with Califor
nia last season has returned has caused
a counter current of feeling.
Dole was looked upon as the veteran
of last year, who would take the bur
den of the punting upon his shoulders,
as well as help advance the ball, Â£s
has heretofore been the case whenever
he has been in the game. The crack
athlete has engaged in business.
Alexander J. Chalmers will be one of
the three players which remain of the
eleven that engaged the, California,
squad upon the gridiron last November.
Chalmers proved one of the speediest
halfbacks the cardinal has ever known.
Wilfred 11. Dole Will Not Return to
the Ranks of the Cardinal
This Term.

With a party of friends Jimmy attend
ed the performance at the Alcazar last
njght. He left immediately afterward for
Sheehan's Tavern. SMUaM
This afternoon Jimmy will box withAl
Kaufman, Manager William F. Britt and
Frank Rafael, who Is to be with y : , the
camp from now on.
In the afternoon Britt. spent an hour
and a quarter at continuous work In the
gymnasium. He boxed five four-minute
rounds with Tiv Kreling. In this they
mixfed^ boxing and wrestling. The wrist
machine, punching bag and skipping the
rope completed his , gymnasium - work,
after which he took a plunge . in . the
ocean- , \_ . \u25a0\u0084_:;-. -r \u25a0'\u25a0 â¢ . â¢
"Jack Root, who has just returned from
the coast, tells of an interesting, talk he
had with both Nolan and Nelson. Man
ager and boy are both anxious to secure
Root to prepare Nelson for the battle.
Nolan figured that the finished boxer that
Root is might help him some in 'cleverihg
up* the Illinolsan. '.:....'
"'You don't want to get clever,' coun
seled Root. 'Keep on fighting the way
you have been. It is a difficult matter to
make a man clever after going as far as
you have. Don't change your style. Billy
Meyer did this once, ana with poor re
sults. I'll come on and second and ad
vise you in your fight with Britt, but
don't think that it would be a good thing
for you to change, or even try to change,
your style of boxing.' "j"" :
Britt will sacrifice some of his speed to
develop the stamina required to carry
him a long journey at Colma, but this
loss will hardly be apparent during the
tight.
Yesterday was an active day at the
Britt camp. The Calif ornian put in a
strenuous morning and afternoon and
the grind will continue until a few days
before the contest. Jimmy with Tiv
Kreling spent the morning on the road
going through' the park and around
Strawberry Hill: On his return to the
camp a plunge in the ocean freshened
him and also sharpened his appetite. It
is not necessary for Britt to stint him
self when It comes to eating as he has
no worry about the weight question.
The charge which has been exacted
during the last few days to see Jimmy
training has proved effective. The reg
ulars and hangers on who usually lounge
about training quarters were conspicu
ous by their absence.
â¢ No fee was charged yesterday as the
crowd that went to see the lightweight
go through his training maneuvers could
be comfortably handled. Britt's train
ers are determined that nothing shall
hinder their charge while training. They
claim when the gymnasium Is crowded
the atmosphere is Impureâ a condition
they want to prevent. . \u25a0
When Nelson's advisers had In view the
match with Britt It was their Intention
to change the Dane's style of fighting
and to develop cleverness In him to off
set that quality in Britt. According to
Lou Houseman, the clever sporting edi
tor cf the Chicago Inter Ocean, Jack Root
counseled against this, so the Hegewisch
man is going along at Larkspur,develop
ing stamina and hitting power, upon
which qualities he will depend to bring
him \ictory. Houseman says in his col
umn:
Experts -who; have' seph'iboth Gardner
and Ryan flght' and who, have also' seen

IN BENNINGTON CASE
That was the Chico'e bad luck. Fortune
smiled on her later, for yesterday at 10:30
a. m., about four miles southeast of Point
lieyes, she picked up the steam schooner New
ark, wallowing helplessly In the trough of
the sea with her machinery disabled. The
Chlco towed the Newark Into port. The New
ark left here on Monday for Stewarts Point.
Loading lumber at on open roadstead is an
undertaking fraught with danger, and few
cargoes are taken on board ship at such places
without more or less of perilous excitement.
The average coasting* . fsailormaa " is closeâ
mouthed. Sometimes from natural reticence,
more often from inability to epeak plainly tht
language supposed to go with the American
flag. Whatever the cause, the knowledge of
lew of these mishaps ever reaches the outside
world. The eteam schooner Chico, however,
which arrived yesterday from Union Landing,
was an exception. On August 21, while finish
ing taking on her deckload. a big sea, which
was almost a small tidal wave, struck the
Chico. turned her on beam ends and rolled
overboard about 5000 feet of lumber. The
\u2666 chooner'a crew narrowly escaped being swept
into the sea with the deckload 'and eeveru!
of the Bailors received painful bruises In their
struggle to reach something by which to
har^ on.

haggard and hungry looking, , was
taken suddenly ill in Reno yesterday'
morning and was taken to the County
Hospital. An hour later he died. It
wits thought his home was . at Sacra

schoolmate of the dead man recognized
him.' Until a few years ago ; he owned
a ' prosperous J newspaper- at-,;. Eugene,

dered his money, and -finally left" his

to have the body shipped to that city

evening, and by 6:30 a, nÂ». Monday the Mon
terey had pumped out the water ballast from
her oil tanks, filled them â¢with the liquid fuel
and was ready for sea. At 2:15 p. m. on Mon

wen miles southwest of the lightship, heading
:or Tacoma at a .ten-knot gait.
The Dauntless hold* the record on this coast
for ocean towing. Whether it be Just between
here and Monterey, or between Monterey and
Honolulu or Alaska, she always makes good
time, through fair weather or foul, and ln
\-ariably reaches her destination with her tow
in rood condition. She te on the move almost
continuously, and, being an oil burner, re

REDDING, Aug. 22.-^An unexpected
strike was made last night at the fam
ous Afterthought mine, twenty-seven
miles east of Redding. It has been
claimed that the . ore bodies in . the
Afterthought district do not go down
ward. The ore body found last night
was \u25a0 encountered at the lowest work
ing level, 250 feet deeper than any
hitherto found. The find demonstrates
that the ore goes very deep in the
Shasta County copper belt. The dis
covery, caused considerable excitement
among mining men/ The Great Westi

EI^JtEKA. Aug. 22.â Mayor Torrey
to-day placed a ban on wide-open gam
bling: in the city of Eureka. In a pub
lished notice he gives warning that no
illegal games will bo permitted. This
action on : the part of the executive Is
due to an ' effort that has been made
during the last few weeks to return
to the old days when every game was
permitted to run full blast. At a re
cent election the saloon and gambling
interests boasted that with the election
of the present Mayor, whom they sup
ported to a man, the town would again
run ' wide . open. Many. ; games were
running up to last night, showing that
the gamblers believed they would be
accorded protection, but the order has
closed everything to-day.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's liner
Ventura, which arriv*d Monday evening from
Australia, was released from Quarantine early
yesterday morning and about 4:30 a. m.
docked at Pacific-street wharf. EHuing the
s-iay in Quarantine all on board were vaccin
ated, frorr. the little brown passenger in the
Asiatic ste*rape to Captais Kay ward In the
l-ijr room under tlve brldee.
T*he case of smallpox responsible for the de
tention in quarantine was in mild form. Tne
patient, a steerage steward, was left In quar
antine at Honolulu, where the liner was luml
j-ai'-d by the Marine Hospital authorities. In
addition. Surgeon Clarke of the liner had taken
ail n*edful precautions, co the likelihood of any
;urther danger on the Ventura was very
slight. Federal doctors, however, take no
<~hanres, so the liner was fumigated strain.
Before she was released sixty-five people
who were thought to have been directly ex
posÂ«>d to the Infection were taken ashore and
will be detained In quarantine for a few days.
Those ejected for detention were twenty-one
men from the steward" Â» department, ten from
the engirwÂ»room, twenty-nine steerage passen-
and five second sabia passengers. Of the
second cabin passengers held, three were Mor
â¢nons, who refused to submit to vaccination.
The thirty-four Japanese from Honolulu were
allowed to land.

/"CORRUPTION in the United States army is distinctly on the
I. increase. As for its intensity, that can be .realized from the
transcendent ugliness of the.Taggart affair; -and: as" for quan
tity,, that; is indicated by the dismissal of more officers for corrup
tion this year, although it is only about half through, than there were
in the whole of 1904. The evidence is quite string that if all the
officers implicated in the scandal \yhich is at present shocking the
country get dismissals as the result of court-martials which ought
to follow the sworn statements of this trial, the already long list of
offenders would be much increased. , ; -" '''\u25a0'\u25a0 k '
Ten officers have been dismissed this year for financial irregu
larities. There would have been more had not some resignations
saved additions to the list. This for, one half-year is an astonishing
amount of'dishonesty. It could easily be estimated by intuition and
without recourse, to statistics that among the things done that are
"unbecoming an officer and a gentleman" thieving must be not so
frequent an offense against morality as some other corruptions. These
may.be . not so easily found out nor so often exposed as the stealing,
but the thefts are probably good suggestive indicators of the amount
of the other. .
The sworn statements of the latest scandal tend to create a pub
lic impression that misconduct of army officers is 'spreading. The
investigation of one offender leads to the disclosure that there is ; a
nest of, them. The statistics of dismissals tend to corroborate that
impression. There is said 1 to be a : report that the War Department
has semi-official ly indicated that it will take no action as to the pro
ceedings of the Wooster trial unless compelled to do so by other
officers pref erring; charges . against those . who \u25a0 are under suspicion
because of evidence given in the Taggart' investigation. ' If ; th'is;turri
out to be true it will add another reason, for the rgrowthiof, the: im-;

THE MAN'S .TWO WISHES.
nnHE universities are -open for the autumnal semester, and the
students fill the campus. No doubt there is a. constantly gjo\v
1 ing disposition on the part of parents to give their children a uni
versity education, and there is also a constantly growing solicitude
on the part of the. judicious, as to the effect of university life; upon
the young. It is believed that personal independence among stu
dents is on the wane. In matters of dress, expenditure and manners
there is a growing tendency to compel .conformity to an artificial
standard. A college boy must keep up with the procession, and doing
this frequently compels' undue attention to that which is not a- useful
part of education. : ; .
It is doubtful whether Thoreau would find himself at home; in
a modern university, so far is individuality, stricken out: in compul
sory conformity to a standard that has in turn to be outgrown and,
abandoned" when the actualities- of life are upon the graduate..' lt
may be said truthfully that at a modern college there is compelled
too much attention and waste of time upon non-essentials. < Institu
tions run mad upon athletics, class antagonisms, the, idleness arid
horse play of fraternity houses, and the unchecked indulgence, in
habits that interfere with that. training of mind- and judgment which
is the high purpose of education. It may not be denied that from
this maze of mistakes some strong men issue,, but they would be
strong anyway, because it is in their quality. They set : for them
selves ideals so firmly fixed that frivolous contacts cannot dislodge
them. The sufferers are the majority, who need inspiration to ideals
that are high and master motives that make' for good character. .
If the college atmosphere be promotive of self-indulgence; prod
igal waste of time, the sacrifice of study to pleasure, it has a lethal
effect upon characters and consciences and physical constitutions
that are yet undeveloped^ and education is thrown 1 away, the years
of acquisition are wasted, and the hopes of parents eclipse in a great
bitterness and regret. There is not a college in the country that will
not better perform its mission by stricter attention to discipline., Too
much student license is tolerated. Disorders are condoned in stu
dents that would be prevented and punished in non-students. The
schools are intended to train men for the duties of life and for or
derly citizenship. Such training is not found in compelling the exe
cution of idiotic stunts on the campus, ducking in ponds, destroying
hats, garments and other property, and in guying the faculty. & It
should be understood that the young who are sent to college, freed
from home discipline and restraint, require that these should have
a substitute. liSp ,V~ Â£H>iv'
Young men are prone to begin where their grandfathers leave off.
In the taking on of habits of self-indulgence they forget that their
grandfathers were, by the hardy circumstances of their, lives, com
pelled to refrain from, gratification of the appetites until they had
reached the age of judgment, with their physical constitutions ma
tured. Habits of self-control safeguarded them from abuse and by
moderation they lived long and. usefully. It is the testimony; of
physicians and of the physical examiners of applicants for admission
to West Point and Annapolis, and of young men who want to en
list in the army and navy, that there is a startling percentage of
them found unfit because of overindulgence in narcotics and stimu
lants. Unfortunately the physical degeneration and weakness of will
of these are to be transmitted to the breaking down of future genera
tions.
At the opening of the Berkeley University President Wheeler
talked plainly to the freshmen, and they will do well if they heed the
admonition. The president* said : "A* man can ; go to hell , from the*
university as well as from any other place, and here he mu.-tv.ork
out his own salvation. It will help you if you establish habits M of
steady work, plain living and devotion to the' best "and not : the most
unimportant things of college life. Do not lead an aimless and lazy
life here. In spite of temptations to dawdling have a fixed routine
and follow it." \u0084 ;, . - -
Luxury and laziness are the prime curses of the" race. -, They
mean physical weakness and brief and useless lives. Education
means energy and alertness, human sympathy with the; pinch* in the,
fortunes of others, a stern will that takes success calmly and failure
with phijpsophy edged by v the determination to try again. It means
industry, thrift, temperance and . self-control. When college life
fails to strengthen these qualities in men it has done har.m and not
good, and they have already gone to. that hell which is a condition
of life and not a remote state after life has perished- in its own lack
of high purpose. If all the tens of thousands who yearly seek higher
education in American colleges get the right education the life and
merit of the country, are valuably recruited from those institutions.
But if they learn self-indulgence, extravagance and false ideals, their
experience is a distinct injury to the national life.

by the â¢ newspapersâ -that he ;. is. not- as'
black as. he is painted, but; oh the' cdh-^
trary, is " about , the whitest *\u25a0 and,, purest
politician that ever/bathed in the pool of
politics. "He remarks that he | was - never!
connected with, any 'scheme .of . graft or;
enriched by a dollar dishonestly acquired.'.
He says that he, does^not want>the ! dele-,

that they sign up for an' informal caucus :
to consider subjects^ pertaining, to the or

his waning : political j prospects, but \u25a0he
will never be in position to deliver the
promised goods.
-When the time arrives for a caucus of
the majority of delegates to the Republi

given by the organization representing
the majority. There are indications that
the regular Republican Anti-Ruef caucus
will be attended by nearly 300 of the

Indications. that the Joint nominee of the

Senator Lukens, acting for the ."solid
two," and Attorney Walter Brann, rep
resenting the "solid five," ." waived their
rights to make . a, concluding argument
yesterday morning. Both sides are thus
resting on the strength of the evidence
introduced by > the eighty graduate stu
dents and the professional men who testi
fied in regard to illegal licenses. - Either
side' is "equally certain, that no incrim
inating evidence has been found against
it, and each is content to rest the case
with the commission without argument.
The final recommendations will be made
to'the Governor in secret and will -not be
known until the final action Is taken -by
the chief executive. In the meantime the
fate of the State \ Board of Dental Ex

The commission appointed by Lieuten
ant' Governor Anderson to investigate the
li regularities alleged to exist within the
State Board of Dental Examiners met in
executive session yesterday morning. It
could not make its report to the Gov
ernor,-because the mass of evidence was
not yet transcribed. The work of type
writing the testimony; taken , during the
hearing will; not be completed for several
weeks, and the recommendations will not
go to the Governor.' until about Septem

PERSONAL.
"San Francisco people werf W attend
ance at the exposition In large numbers,
and lam Impressedâ as all others have
beenâ by my first visit to this city*"
"It seemed when the Portland people
made an effort to obtain a Government
exhibit at the Lewis and Clark Centen
nial Exposition that Congress was tired
out by granting appropriations, yet by a
strong api>eal and with the help of the
other coast States the money was grant
ed, and as magnificent an exhibit as
the Government produced Is located in
Portland now. It has more than repaid
the outlay of -expense. I understand the
people of San Francisco want to have It
transferred here for the Mechanics' Fair
and that they will petition the President
to aid in this desire. I will help, and will
use all my influence for the project. As
the only member of the board chosen to
take charge of the exhibit on the coast
at present, I have a deep interest in the
undertaking.
This is his flrst trip to the coast, and he
was very much pleased with California
ai;d the Portland Exposition. He de
.scribeG the latter as the very best means
cf advertising the Far West by bringing
a desirable classâ though not all wealthy
âto view* the resources of coast States,
and he said that from- information he
received in Portland nearly 9 per cent of
the fair visitors made their way to San
Francisco. He praised the railroads for
the admirable manner in which they
handled the passenger traffic, and being
president at the Harrimanr dinner at the
exposition was able to get an idea of the
amount of permanent residents attracted
to the West by the prevailing low rates.
In speaking of his visit. to the coast in
connection with the fair Mr. -Fox said:
Mr. Fox's diplomatic" career began with
hÂ«s ' appointment under President Grant
to the consular Service, and since then
he has risen through ' exceptional ability
to the position he now occupies. His lin
guistic knowledge nts him for the di
rectorship of the Bureau of Republics, or
ganized Is ISS3, of which he was formerly
chief clerk. â¢ â¢ \u25a0
Wii!ia:ns C. Fyx. director of Interna-I
tior.al Bureau of American Republics and
member of the board In charge of the
United States Government exhibit at the
Lewis and Clark Exposition, arrived in
San Fjranciseo yesterday. At the solici
tation of those interested he will attempt
to eel the Government exhibits for the 1
proposed Mechanics' Fair." While Jn Cali
fornia Mr. Fox will inquire into the re
lations between the coast States and the.
fckiuth American countries so. far as hls
tirae will permit, and the information will'
be used by the bureau.- â¢ 'V ; ;

The Bank of California' has con
tracted to buy and the firm of H. M.
N'ewhall & Co., as the White Investment
..Company, has agreed to sell at a specified
price the L fronting on California, San
some and Halleck streets, that partly
surround^ the present site of the
Bank of California. .The bank seeks
the land for the site of a great build-
Ing to be. erected if the deal, that now
would seem to be sure to be perfected,
goes through. The amount; of money
Involved in the. deal is very large, but
those principally concerned declined
yesterday to say what the price for the
property actually is. .
George A. Newhall admitted that the
transaction is in progress and may be
accomplished soon. A. rumor that the
Newhalls will take .in the London and
San Francisco Bank property, at Cali
fornia and Leidesdorff streets as a re
sult of the deal on foot was, mentioned
to Mr. .Newhall, but he- declined to
either' assert or deny, the truth of the
story. There is probably a basis for it.
Negotiations regarding both the site
and the : building to be erected haye 1
covered quite a period. At one time it
was, rumored that the Bank of Califor
nia and the Newhalls might construct a
building together, but this proposition
was not finally favorably entertained
by the Bank of California. ' The New
| halls own forty-five feet on California
: strtet by forty-four on Sansome and 132
feet on Halleck. The bank cannot ex
pand without purchasing the Newhall
land, at least not on the northwest cor
ner of California and Sansome streets.
This fact is realized fully by all real
estate men who have been watching
developments.
Frontage on California street was
purchased by the Newhalls in January,
1904, and twenty feet of this land was
transferred to the Bank of California
in March, 1904. The talk of erecting a
great bank building on the corner has
been current since that time. If the
present deal goes through the Bank of
California will have 132:6 feet on Cali
fornia 6treet, 124 feet on Sansome and
132:6 feet on Halleck, sufficient land
for a handsome and costly modern
structure on one of the best corners in
San Francisco.

With both hands lifted high in air,
Johnnie Kappiano rushed into the Mls
eloa police station last night and en
deavored to make himself understood by
Captain Anderson by wild gesticulations.
The captain advised him to become com
posed and relate the cause of his anxiety
as best he could. After Fappiano had
wiped big drops of perspiration from his
brow, be proceeded to tell the captain
that he had been "flm-flammed". by the
substitution of silver for gold money by
his landlady
Fappiano said he had been working in
the cuiclcsilver mines in .Santa Clara
County and had In his possession 535, gold
coin, when he reached San Francisco, one
?20, one 510 and one J5 piece. The amount
he was sure of because he had not stop
ped on his way to the city until he ar
rived at his lodging-house on the -San
Bruno road, where he had . dinner- and
immediately afterward 4 tendered, his land
lady $15 for two weeks' board and lodging
obtained before he secured work in the
quicksilver mines.
The woman picked up' the money /and
started to put- it away, when," to her sur
prise, she beheld what she took to be a
flfty-cent piece and a silver quarter, mak
ing seventy-five cents instead of $15. She
drew the attention of Fappiano to what
seemed a mere mistake of coin. He , ac
cepted the mistake theory, and, to make
good his error, dug- down once more and
pulled out of the recesses of his Jeans a
big $20 piece and passed it to her. She
once more scanned the coin and found,
as she believed, a big silver dollar. This
time she became indignant and charged
Fappiano with deceit. He in turn ac
cused herÂ«of doing: the "flim-flam" act
in changing the good gold money into
silver. Neither side would yield and as
a last resort the excited Fappiano rushed
off to the police station.
Captain Anderson detailed Detective
Graham on the case. The detective se
cured the aid of an interpreter, and, after
various questions, it was found that Fap
piano had placed the gold coin In the
garments he had worn while at work in
ihe quicksilver mines and that the quick
silver had become attached to "the sur
face of the gold and made It look like
silver. As soon as the coins had been
held over the flame of a gas jet, . the
quicksilver disappeared, revealing the
true value of the coin.
The solution of the mystery satisfied
both parties and in the peace conference
that followed Fappiano and his landlady,
with Invited friends, uncorked some bot
*.les of grape Juice. Henceforth when
Fappiano gets gold money he will see
that it does not lose Its good red color by
keeping company with debasing quick
silver.

Mrs. EmiliafCayalli Decamps

Their, Grandmother's; Care
Mrs. Emilia 'Cavalli,* nineteen .years old,
the pretty wife of L.' J. Cavalll. a stat
uary maker at 1571 Market street, has
disappeared and is suspected by her hus
band of having eloped with Charles Case?
who for two months had roomed at the
home of , Mrs. Cavalll's ' parents, Mr.; and
Mrs.. Peter Mesquita, at Hay wards,
where the missing girl wife was also
temporarily stopping. Besides apparently
abandoning huskand and parents, Mrs.
Cavalli has left behind ' her two mites
of babies, '.\u25a0 twins, only two months old.
Town Marshal Ramage of Haywards and
the Oakland and San Francisco police are
trying to find a trace of the missing
young woman.
Mrs. Cavalll left her parents' home last
Saturday evening at 6:SO j o'clock.* declar
ing she would not return until her hus
band had | means with which to provide
her with a home of her own. She had
a few words with her mother before she
left. Before their little' tiff could be set
tled, the young wife departed, apparently
In anger, although subsequent develop
ments have almost convinced the dis
tressed relatives, that 'the girl's bluster
was only a subterfuge to hide her real
purpose, namely, to run away with Case.
Case is a lather, twenty-one years old,
tall and not unattractive in masculine
charm. He had roomed with the Mes
quitas for two months and had become
very well acquainted with the young
wife, .whose husband was absent^ most
of I the time in | San . Francisco, where he
was trying to establish his business on
a profitable basis, one that would soon
warrant him in taking his little family
across , the bay to settle in a home jof
their own. . - \u25a0.. ..'Â»..
Case made an \ excellent- Impression -at
the Hay wards home, , and was about *to
take . employment at his trade with the
girl's father, who Is a plasterer. Ar
rangements had been made for him to go
to work on Monday morning. He was
not connected .with the disappearance of
the , young mother until yesterday. Then
his failure to appear for work Monday,
his continued absence, an j unexplained
trip to Oakland Sunday and some suspi
cious actions recalled at this time as In
dicating very confidential relations be
tween Mrs. Cavalll and. Case; all this
crowded upon the grieving family with
double force. They unwillingly declared
their belief to the police that Case had
stolen tTTe missing - girl's- affections and
had Induced her to fly with him, leaving
two tiny* yhelpleas mites of wailing , babes
to be succored as best the grandmother
could care for them.*
The i Cavallis were married in Boston,
Mass., not- two years ago. Cavalli came
to California with ; \u25a0 his . wife | ' several
months ago. She went to live with -her
parents until her babies were born and
her husband should have' settled perma
nently in business. .
