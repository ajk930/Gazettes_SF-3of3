MRS. MOODY IS CONTRADICTED
Proponents have thus far met the contentions of contestant as follows: Douglas Sloane Watson and Arthur B.
Watson, who witnessed the execution of the will* testified that Miss Dolbeer was sane at ihe time. Arthur
Sutton saw Miss Dolbeer immediately after she signed the will and she appeared .then. to be in good spirits,
conversing happily and being in normal frame of mind. Mrs. Sands W. Forman, who was an intimate friend,
did not notice ''anything strange or unusual in her manner or appearance during the last year of her life."
Mrs. Forman, who received a call from INfliss Dolbeer the day after the making of the Will, also contradicted the
testimony of Mrs. J. L. Moody that the testatrix acted that day as if mentally deranged.

Mrs. Forman's testimony was strong
to- the effect that there was absolutely
no ground for the allegation that the

Being led to believe Harmony was in
reality High Tide, which won blue rib
bons for Bates, VanJerbilt changed
the horse's name to High Tide, by
which he was entered at the Garden
show.
While there was no doubt of Van
derbilt's entire good faith in the mat
ter, Morgan is determined to' have the
horse back. His daughter's interest in
the animal is the main reason for his
insistence.
Morgan early last summer had King,
with several other animals (among
which was the r'eal High Tide, which
he had bought from the late C. F.
Bates) sent to the stock farm of W. H.
Catlin at Port Chester. Until a short
time ago he supposed the horse was
still there, but when his coachman
sent word to have King returned to
New York another horse was sent in
his stead, resembling the prize winner
in a general way, but far inferior to
him.
Then began an investigation, which
developed the fact that King, under
the name of Harmony, was exhibited
at the Newport Horse Show, where he
captured the blue ribbon with ease.
Vanderbilt promptly bought Harmony
and his mate, Portia, for $6500, the lat
ter horse representing a value of about
J1500. > T

determination to recover the horse at
any cost, but the difficulty may be ad-
Justed without recourse to courts;
Recognition of the horse exhibited
under the name of High Tide at the
Horse Show in New York last week by
Vanderbilt as King, a horse bought
by Morgan two years ago from Joseph
Kaiser, a dealer, served to deepen the
mystery which had already begun to
encircle the animal.

rr.ocracy, to reorganize the party on a
radical basis Is responsible for the early
resurrection. The defeated leaders of
the Parker campaign have begun a
movement to retain control of the par
ty and maintain the integrity of the
organization in this State. If it can be
done in New York State it can be done
In all other States of the East. By this
means It is hoped to perpetuate ftie di
rection of party affairs In the hands of
the present leaders and prevent the
Bryan forces assuming control.
The first step in this direction was
the dinner at the Manhattan Club, at
which Judge Parker presided, last
night. Among those present were Wil
liam F. Sheehan, chairman of the Na
tional Executive Committee; Delancy
Nicoll, vice chairman, and Cord Meyer,
chairman of the State committee..
Neither' August Bclmont nor Senator
McCarren was present.
When cigars came on the guests set
tled into conversation, that developed
into a regular political conference. The
lessens of the campaign were pointed
out, the danger of Bryanite supremacy
wag discussed and the proper steps to
preserve the integrity of the party as
at present organized were canvassed. It
was the opinion that the party must
maintain an organization the year
around, and that until this were done
it would always be a hopeless fight to
attempt to build up an effective or
ganization when the campaigns came
on.
It was the general opinion that steps
Ehould be taken to raise funds for the
Ftrengthening and maintaining of the
State organization. Governor Odell's
success in uniting the Republican or
ganizations in this city with the State
machine commends itself to the Demo
crats, and in spite of the unpopularity
of Tammany up the State there are
many Democrats who believe that no
effective work can be done In the State
until a. union of the ur>-State Democ
racy with Tammany Hall Is brought
about. These men would even go to the
length of supporting Charles F. Mur
phy for State leader if they thought
that thereby money could be provided
tor placing the up-State organization
upon a. solid basis.
It Is alleged by detectives that a plot

to-day was for Joseph E. Valentine,
president of the Iron Molders* Union of

at different foundries and on the streets
of these cities. On October 7 Samuel

NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â The national
trustees of the McKinley Memorial As
sociation, who have in their charge the
erection of the McKinley monument in
Canton, Ohio, met here to-day and
viewed the design presented by the of
ficial architect, H. Van Buren Mc-
Gonigle. At the close of the meeting
it was stated that the sum needed had
not been raised and that changes which
may be necessary will be made for fin
ancial rather than artistic reasons.
The drawings are said to sho^jv a
massive- structure unlike either the
Grant monument In New York or the
Garfleld monument In Cleveland. The
site for the monument on'the top of a
hill renders a beautiful approach pos
sible and the opportunities offered gave
the architect an" idea which it Is said
would require more money than the
trustees have in hand. They have now
about $550,000 and need about $50,000
more to carry out the plans as they
wish. The .trustees, after a long'dis
cussion, during which they endeavored
to plan changes in the design to enable
their means to cover the expenses and
not result â¢ in the added expenditures
that marked the building of the Grant
monument, appointed a committee to
confer with the architect regarding the
changes whicji they will report to the

ST. LOUIS. Nov. 22. â Nearly a car
load of oranges and fresh vegetables
of nearly every variety. Including: corn
and tomatoes, arrived here to-day for
"Sacramento Valley orange day,"
which is set for to-morrow. The car
also contained chrysanthemums, Cali
fornia hollv and branches of olive
trees bearing gretn and ripe frui* and
other decorative material. A curious
throng came and went all day at the
Sacramento Valley exhibit in the Pal
ace of Agriculture, where employes
were busy arranging the decorations
for the orange distribution. It has
been well advertised and will attract
a tremendous crowd of World's Fair
visitors.
Special Day Set Aside for the Free
Distribution of California
Fruit.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY WILL
GIVE O RANGES AT FAIR-
The defense will fight the case from
several standpoints, but will- rely
chiefly upon 'the statute of limitations
for relief in the court-, claiming 4hat
the conspiracy must be shown- to ex
ist beyond a reasonable doubt. v. -
Another thing of note was the
statement made. by the defense" that if,
as was charged in the indictment, fic
titious names had been ,used and false
affidavits made these conditions would
make, any title granted by the Gov
ernment 'void and of no effect and If
this was so, no harm had been done,
the Government had not been de
frauded and consequently there had
been no conspiracy in fact, and
though acts morally wrong might
have been done, no crime had been
committed, punishable by the court. \
At the conclusion of the opening ar
gument Charles B. Moores, former
Register of the Land Office at Oregon
City, was called to the witness stand
and identified sixteen affidavits filed
in his office during the year 1900. The
balance of the day was consumed in
an argument regarding the admissi
bility of these documents. The court
finally ruled that they could be ad
mitted.
"The prosecution will show that of
these parties Mrs. Emma L. Watson,
under the name of Emma L. Porttr,
appeared at the Oregon City Land Of
fice and made a filing on a tract of
land, representing that she had lived
there, and that she brought evidence
of parties, partly fictitious, and after
making proof was given . a patent by
the Government, and that this title
was then conveyed to Mrs. Emma L.
Watson. We will show that ; Frank
Wolgamot did the same thing and
transferred his title to Mrs. Watson.
Harry Barr did likewise. So far as we
can discover, out of sixteen cases the
persons making affidavits were ficti
tious or knew nothing of the facts of
the case.
"We will show that some of these
names were forged and signed by Ma
rie Ware and Horace G. McKinley.
These are not Items of Immediate mo
ment or punishable in this trial, but are
evidences of conspiracy.
"We will show that the acts of Tar
pley and McKinley in taking testimony
and of Putcr and Mrs. Watson in
working to secure patents all tended
to show conspiracy. We will show
that each assisted In furthering the
plan until conspiracy was consum
mated.". â¢ - -â¢
Hall, for the prosecution, stated that
he. would show that a conspiracy to
defraud the Government out of public
lands existed between the defendants;
that it is not- necessary to prove that
they knew each other or that they all
entered the conspiracy at the same
time; that it suffices to show that they
were all working toward a purpose. Re
garding the specific charge against
each of the defendants Hall said:

Sped*] Dispatch to The Call
PLATTE , CENTER, Neb., Nov. 23.
William Holden, a farm employe, dur
ing the noon hour to-day -entered the
Platte Valley Bank, demanded the
bank's cash, and, on the refusal of
Cashier Barney Schroeder to surren
der it, shot the latter in the breast,
inflicting a serious but not fatal
wound. He made his escape in a bug
gy without obtaining any money.
Sheriff Carrig and a posse captured
the robber nine miles west of Platte
Center. He was taken back and pos
itively Identified by Schroeder. even
though he had changed his clothing
and removed a glass eye that he was
wearing when he did the shooting.
.Frederick D. Michaels, .who was
driving the handsom cab in which
Young was shot, said the first ha
knew of any trouble in the cab was
when he heard the sound of a pistol
shot and his startled horse sprang'for
ward. A moment later Miss Patterson
opened the trap and told me to drive
to a drug store. He followed her instruc
tions without making any inyestigation
and did not look Inside the cab when
the drug clerk refused to treat the
wounded man and ordered him taken
to a hospital with all speed.
Michaels said he picked .up Young
and Miss Patterson at the circle at
Fifty-ninth street and Broadway on
the morning of June 4. and Young or
dered him to drive to a hat, store.
Young came out of the store wearing
a new hat and they continued on down
town and stopped at a saloon /on the
corner, of B'.eecker street and' West
Broadway.. The man and woman went
into the place and remained there for
several minutes. When they came out
they got into the cab and ' he : , drove
down town, along West Broadway.
Neither of them showed any i signs of
liquor. ; ;â¢
The man told him to drive rapidly, as
he had to be at the pier at the foot of
Fulton street at 9 o'clock. It was then
between 8:30 and 8:40 o'clock. c They
had just passed Canal street when ha
heard the pistol shot. T
On cross-examination, Michaels said
that when Miss Patterson raised the
trap 'and 'told him .to drive to' the drug
store she "spoke : scared-like." .
In outlining his case yesterday 'As
sistant District " Attorney ' Rand* in-
CAB DRIVER'S STORY.
Captain Sweeney, who was in
charge of the station-house at the
time, identified the revolver, which, he
said, was found in Young's pocket and
which he subsequently turned over to
Assistant District Attorney Garvin
with the three loaded cartridges and
the exploded shells. Miss Patterson, he
said, told- him/the story of the ride
downtown and declared that she had
not seen the shooting. She denied
that she had any words with Young
and said that she had picked up the
revolver, which had fallen from
Young's hand when he fired the fatal
shot, and placed it in his pocket.
Several police officers were called to
the stand in quick succession and ex
amined /briefly regarding happenings
in the police station when Miss Pat
terson was brought there under ar
rest. : <'S-~S
The human skeletons which fre
quently have been mentioned in con
nection with the case made their first
appearance In the courtroom when
Coroner's Physician Philip O'Hanlan
was called to the stand. Dr. O'Han
lan testified that he had performed
the autopsy on Young's body and said
that death was caused by hemorrhage
of the left lung, resulting from a shot
wound. The bullet had entered the
left shoulder and passed downward
toward the center of the body, lodg
ing in the muscles of the back; "A
probe was inserted in the skeleton to
show the course taken by the bullet
and both the skeleton and a bullet,
which the witness identified as the one
taken from Young's body, were
marked as exhibits.
SKELETONS AND A BULLET.
Levy had one of the jurors hold a
watch while the witness estimated one
minute of time, marking the begin
ning and ending by clapping his hands.
The juror's watch showed that only
six seconds elapsed between the two
claps..
Stemm said there were several men
around the cab as it stood near the
drug 1 store, but he "could not recall
seeing a red-haired young man re
ferred to by Levy. Ha first told of his
connection with the tragedy the fol
lowing Saturday. He had heard that
the police were looking for him as a
witness and voluntarily surrendered
himself.
In reply to questions by Levy the
witness said that about eight or nine
minutes elapsed from the time he
heard the shot until the cab reached
the drug store. Traffic both ways
prevented the cab getting there
sooner.
"The driver seemed to be all tangled
up." said Stemm, "and I rode on the
step of the'cab to the hospital. When
we reached the hospital I helped a po
liceman carry the man in and then
helped the woman to alight. She was
frightened and pale and looked as if
she wanted to cry but could not."
The introduction of these exhibits
caused a sensation in the courtroom,
and for a time Miss Patterson seemed
on the verge of collapse. The court
room was crowded when the trial was
resumed and the corridors of the build
ing were thronged. â¢.Â¦Â»'*
William Stemm Jr., the young man
who directed Michaels, the cab driver,
to the hospital, was the star witness of
the day. He was standing on the cor
ner of West Broadway and York street
and heard the revolver shot just after
the cab had passed him. He was start
led and looked up the street quickly,
trying to locate the spot from which
the shot, was fixed. There was no one
on the opposite side of. the street, and^
he concluded that the shot must have
been fired in the cab. which was about
twelve feet away and moving rather
slowly. As the cab swung around to
the drug store he followed and saw the
driver talking with the druggist. In
the cab he saw a man and a woman,
the man lying in the woman's lap.
WOMAN WAS FRIGHTENED.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â Several un
usual features were presented in the
Supreme Court to-day ift the trial of
"Nan" Patterson for the alleged mur
der pi Caesar Young. During the day
a skeleton and two pieces of skin from
Young's second finger were produced in
court by the prosecution. The skeleton
was shown in order that the course of
the bullet that killed Young might be
traced. The State, it is understood, ex
pects to use the pieces of skin In refut
ing the suicide, theory.
formed the jury that the prosecution,
after months of endeavor, had been
unsuccessful in locating J. Morgan
Smith, who. it is claimed, purchased
the revolver with which Young was
killed. He hoped, however, that Smith
would be brought forward by. the de
fense at the proper time. Later in
the day Miss Patterson's counsel,
Levy, said the defense had no inten
tiop of producing Smithy
"If the iirosecutlon wants Smith
as a witness they have got to find
him. We are having our own troubles
with the defense and are not going out
of our way to help the people supply
the rents In their fabric of ; evidenceV'
Levy said that he did not know
where Smith and his wife were, nor
would he take any pains to discover
their .whereabouts.
.Following the announcement it was
said that the District Attorney's of
fice would renew its search for the
missing witness with the hope of lo
cating him and compelling him to ap
pear in court before it is too late.
Only the announcement that the de
fendant herself would go on the stand
and tell of her acquaintance , with
Young could have created more public
interest than the report that the dead
bookmaker's widow might appear in
the case. Since her husband died Mrs.
Young has remained in seclusion, ex
cept when she called at the District
Attorney's office and testified before
the Grand Jury. During the trial
6he had not appeared in the court
room, but it is said she has followed
all the proceedings from an adjoining
room.
Next came William Carson, hair and
beard white with age and eyesight so
defective that he had to be led to the
witness chair.
"I know John Dolbeer for fifty odd
years," he said. "He was an engineer
at a lumber mill in Humboldt County
when I first met him. I was in busi
ness there. In April, 1863, we became
partners, and that relation continued
for forty years."
The DolbeeT-Carson Lumber Com
pany is still In existence.
The witness said that John Dolbeer
was a man of cood average judgment,
was honorable and had no bad habits.
Carson lived in Eureka and looked
after the business at that end, while
Dolbeer resided in San Francisco and
had charge of the business here.
"I Mrs. Dolbeer about a year
before and about six months after
the birth of Bertha," said the witness,
"and the mother appeared always to
bf in good health."
Six months after the death of John
Dolbeer the witness found Miss Dol
beer cheerful. She consulted him fre
quently iÂ»i business, and her mind was
clear at aM timesT -
"I saw her eleven months before
she departed for Europe, and there was
nothing strange or unusual about her
whatever," declared Carson.
A number of business letters from.
Miss Dolbeer to the witness, in which
she wrote of their Joint business af
fairs, were introduced to show the
sane and thoughtful consideration she
gave to her affairs.
On cross-examination Carson was
asked if he knew of Mrs. Dolbeer's de
partures from home in 1875 and 1875
and taking up apartments in the Oc
cidental Hotel, but all he could say
was that he "understood there was
trouble in the family." -
"Did you know of any of John Dol
beer's vagaries of mind, particularly
that of a belief that the slaughtering
bf all Protestants was imminent?"
asked Johnson.
"I did not."
The trial Mill be resumed. this morn
ing. . SSIKS3P1
Albert Sutton, who answered that his
vocation was that of an architect, testi
fied that on April 23 he met Miss Dol
beer Just as she came from the office of
the Watsons, immediately after signing
the will. He conversed with her for five
minutes and she appeared cheerful and
spoke in a merry vein of the trip she
was then about to take to EuroDe.
Lucille B. Forman testified that she
had known Miss Dolbeer many years
and saw her the last time on Sunday,
April 24, in the present year, the dajf
after the will was made and a few days
before she. started for Europe.
Miss Dolbeer came to the home of the
witness, accompanied by Miss Mary
Jolliffe, and was in usual good spirits.
She said she expected to enjoy herself
very much in London and Paris, for so
many of her friends were there.
This testimony of Mrs. Forman is
contradictory of the statement of Mrs.
J. 'L.\ Moody that on the stone Sunday
afternoon, when Miss Dolbe>?r called on
her, the testatrix exhibited iigns of in
sanity, having what Mrs. 1-Iondy de
scribed as a "paroxysm of terror." Miss
Dolbeer left Mrs. Moody's home to call
on Mrs. Forman.
Mrs. Forman also disputed the state
ments of Mrs. Moody that during the
last year of her life a great change
came over Miss Dolbeer, indicating
melancholia. The witness told of nu
merous social affairs and automobile
parties into which the- testatrix entered
with great zest. Nothing whatever In
the manner or conduct of Miss Dolbeer
could be interpreted by Mrs. Forman
as evidence of melancholia. The young
woman was phlegmatic in tempera
ment, but no change came over her
showing that her mind was falling.
Â»
Johnson essayed ayain to break the
force of the testimony of witness that
Miss Dolbeer was of sound mind when
she made her will, but success was
very small. Ground covered the day
before was gone over again, but noth
ing new or important developed.
Arthur B. "Watson, brother of Doug
las S.' "Watson, and with him a witness
to the will of Bertha M. Dolbeer, was
next called. He told of the arrival of
Miss Dolbeer at the Watson offices on
April 23, 1904, to have him and his
brother attesjt her execution of the
testament now being: contested.
She produced eight pages of closely
written matter, which she said was
her will, and in the presence of the
witness and his brother she date^l and
signed the instrument
In the conversation that followed
Miss Dolbeer spoke happily of the trip
she was about to take to Europe and
was in the best of spirits, said "Watson.
"What was her mental condition
when she executed the will?"
"She was absolutely sane."
"Do you think she was capable of
making a testament?"
"I think she was."
The witness said his acquaintance
with Miss Dolbeer was not very inti
mate. At Del Monte he saw her play
ing golf and taking part in the tour
nament in which she came within one
stroke of winning the trophy. She
had also driven her automobile a
great deal and proved herself an ex
pert chauffeur.
On cross-examination -the witness
was questioned searchingly as to the
persons with whom he had talked
concerning the case, but there were
no surprising revelations. Hiram
Johnson contented himself in regard
td the statement of Watson that Miss
Dolbeer was "absolutely sane" with
the answer of witness that he knew
nothing whatever of insanity as an
expert.

During the trouble following the
Boxer rising Miss Corelle was a
nurse, and her heroic devotion to duty
gained for her the Stanislaus medal.
While attending the wounded in the
present war she was wounded in the
arm; but she did not permit this to
interfere with her work of mercy, and
for the renewed evidence of heroic de
votion she was decorated with the
medal of St. George.
A young Russian officer fell in love
with this nurse, who is a remarkably
handsome woman, only 21 years old,
and his affection was reciprocated. Re
cently this officer was, reported as
among the missing, and it was believed
that he had been left wounded on the
field or that he had been taken pris
oner by the Japanese.
In order to find her lover Miss Corelle
strolled from the Russian camp ten
days ago and very cheerfully allowed
herself to be captured by the Chinese
bandits. The next step in her schema
was to become a Japanese prisoner,
or, at least, to reach the Japanese
lines. The bandits allowed her to
communicate with the French Consul
;it Newchwang, following which a de
tail of Japanese soldiers reached the
camp of the bandits and Miss Corelle
was taken to Newchwang. Here she
endeavored to becure permission to go
to Japan in search of her lover, but
the Japanese gave her twenty-four
hours to leave the town, suspecting
that she was a Russian spy.
The French Consul at Chefu is now
trying to obtain permission for Miss
Corelle to go to Japan for the purpose
of nursing the Russian wounded there.
CHEFU. Nov. 22.â A romantic story
develops around Miss Corelle, the Red
Cross nurse at Mukden, who reached
Chefu last night. As stated in these
dispatches yesterday Miss Corelle was
captured by Chinese bandits, who sur
rendered her to the Japanese at
Newchwang. According to a reliable
authority, the capture of the young
woman by the bandits was part of her
own scheme to lind her lover.

SACRAMENTO, Nov. 22. â In an of
ficial report filed to-day Dr. N. K- Fos
ter, secretary of the State Board of
Health, says: "Typhoid fever has in
creased to a considerable extent and
is quite prevalent throughout the
State. In locations in which it exists
the water supply should be examined,
for it is in the water the disease is
generally found to originate." He rec
ommends that all water should be
boiled before using until the purity
of the supply is established.
Dr. Foster says the laws governing
the State Board of Health were passed
In the early '70's and are not adapted
to present needs. At the present time
the Board of Health has no authority
to enforce the reporting of vital sta
tistics and as everything Is optional
the results are of little use.
"To modernize our laws," says Dr.
Foster, "and to make possible the
good work which the State Board of
Health can do we have drawn acts
which will be presented to the coming
Legislature."
BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 22.â The final
meeting of the oil companies that are
to make up the Producers' Independent
Agency is to be held in this city to
morrow at the new office building, the
Oil Exchange. When Chairman M. V.
McQuigg calls the meeting to order to
morrow the agreements which have
been drawn up for the signatures of
the producers will be signed by those
who have decided to cast their fortunes
with the agency. The agreement was
drawn at the meetings held In San
Francisco and in this city under the
direction of Attorneys Franklin K.
Lane and George Lane.
The idea of entering into a contract
with the several companies forming
the organization has been carefully
avoided for the reason that such
tracts cannot be enforced. But accord
in 0 - to the plan evolved each company
leases his property and his oil to the
central organization, which constitutes
the sales agency. This sales agency
immediately gives back to each com
pany the same rights and privileges
that It has at the present time to oper
ate its property and produce its oil.
By this plan all of the oil produced
by. each member of the organization
will be compelled to pass through the
agency and will be sold at such prices
only as are fixed by the board of direc-
Up to this time no salaries have been
paid to any officer of the independent,
but naturally there will be expenses in
operating Its extensive business. Pro
vision is made for meeting these ex
penses by a clause providing for a tax
of two cents on each barrel of
the product handled, the tax to go into
a sinking fund. After the expenses are
met from this sinking fund any bal
ance remaining on hand will be dis
posed of annually as a dividend, paid
to the several members of the organiza
tion pro rata, according to the amount
of oil that the association has ihandled
for each producer. /Â¦^J"
The independents to-day received cir
cular letters from San Francisco in
timating that an amount in â¢ excess of
twenty-five cents can be secured for
their oil in the not distant future, and
requesting the companies to withhold
their signatures at the meeting to be
held to-morrow. It Isnot expected that
this eleventh hour communication will
have any weight with the producers,
who have been offered 12% cents for
oil and now see before them a certainty
of 25 cents, with a future prospect for
the industry that looked so unpromis
ing a few months since.

The officers of two counties were

Kenneth Scott, a neighbor, found a
similar note from his daughter
Blanche, aged 13. It was then long
after dark and the parents could not
learn In what direction the children
had gone. They had supplied them
selves with money, taking upward of

ZANDAGAW, Manchuria, by courier
to Mukden, Nov. 22. â The Japanese
lost 500 men in the attacks of Novem
ber IT and 18 and evidently are dis
heartened. When they renewed the at
tack on November 19 they sent out
several battalions from Double-humped
Hill, but their movements lacked de
cision. The Russians opened fire from
Poutiloff (Lone Tree) Hill and neigh
boring eminences. Shells burst in the
midst of the Japanese columns and
quickly checked them. The Japanese
also tried a turning operation at Chan-
Ilndza, but there also they were dis
persed.
There was a slight encounter Novem

short distance into the Japanese
lines, but without much result.
During the last two days the Chinese
have been moving in large numbers
from the east northward, taking their
wives, children and household goods.
They evidence more confidence In the
Russians than in the Japanese. The
Chinese complain that the whole coun

BERLIN, Nov. 23.â The Mukden cor
respondent of the Lokal Anzelger sends
the following:
"Reports of the death of General Ku
roki persist, in spite of denials, and are
revived by Chinese coming from the
Japanese camps.
"First Lieutenant Shupkoff, who has
Just arrived from Port Arthur, reports
that the Russians have laid out three
lines of defenses which the Japanese
must capture before they can reach the
city, after which the Russians can re
tire to the coast forts, which are the
strongest of all. The garrison, which
comprises more than 14,000 men, is in
good spirits. Lieutenant Shupkoff be
lieves that the fortress can hold out
until at least the end of January."
"The Russian forces are gradually
being depleted, but the hope that the
Baltic fleet will come to the aid of the
garrison may render resistance pos
sible until spring."
"It is not probable that the capture
of any one of the main defenses would
result In. the fall of the town, as it
would be at once rendered untenable
by the neighboring Russian forts.
"In the attack at the beginning of
this month the Japanese discovered a
deep moat, partiallv around the Rus
sian lines. This stopped their advance.
They are now attempting to fill it in by
sapping. A continuous and effective
bombardment is destroying much of
the town, but it is doubtful if it has
impaired its ability to withstand at
tack.
DALNY, Nov. 22.â The Chicago Daily
News correspondent to-day cabled the
following:
"There is every indication that Port
Arthur cannot be captured by assault,
but will fall only when the Russian
forces are so depleted by lack of food
and so reduced in number that they
will be unable to man the line of forts.
During the long siege, after large
losses, said to aggregate 40,000, the Jap
anese have not taken a single main
fort. Of these main defenses seventeen
remain intact. The Japanese are in
the same oosltion as when their at
tack was repulsed two months ago.
"However, they have now driven
their trenches to within short dis
tances of the forts and their infantry
lines are about 200 yards distant from
the Russians.

Thousands of Women Have Kidney
Trouble and Never Suspect It
Almost every one, from personal experience, knows that the effects of any kind of severe physical
strain are felt, first of all, in the small of the backâ in other words in those Vital Organs, the Kidneys.
This is as true in the case of the very powerful as it is with one of less strength, and it is especially
true whenever the kidneys are weak or out of order.
The Great Kidney Remedy, Swamp Root, strengthens the kidneys and through them helps all the
other organs. , \
WOMEN suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease is not always correctly understood; in many
cases when doctoring they are led to believe that womb trouble or female weakness of some sort is responsible
for their ills, when in fact disordere'd kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles.

Disposal of Realty Objected to In In

The petition of Esther Fleisher for
permission to sell the realty belonging
to the Wolf Fleisher estate met with
the promised opposition of Attorney
Arthur Barendt, representing the Aus
trian claimant, in Judge Kerrigan's
court yesterday morning. Further ac
tion went over to next Tuesday. Mr.
Barendt said that the administratrix
already has about $60,000 In personal
property belonging to the estate,,
which is $9000 in excess of the present
indebtedness and probable expense of
administration. Therefore, said he. it j
was not necessary to sell the valuable j
realty. Besides, in the interests of the
woman who claims to be the rightful I
widow, it wo-uld be best not to have j
the property, converted into cash, in 1
which shape it might be more easily }
disposed of before the contest is set-!
tied. Judge Maguire. representing j
Mrs. Fleisher, said that the sale of a j
part of the property was necessary to
meet the expenses of the estate. They
desired to sell all but three parcels.

All that Jerome would say about the
confession is that Â¦ Jacobs confessed

Forty-fourth street, that he did go as
far as the inner vestibule and that he
remained there .for, some,. : time in or

NEW YORK, Nov. 22. â Joseph Ja
cobs, a detective, who obtained evi
dence against Richard Canfield, was
arrested to-day by order of District
Attorney Jerome on a charge of per
jury. He was held in $2000 bail and
committed to the Tombs in default.
The arrest was based on, a confession
he made to Philip J. Britt and General
Benjamin F. Tracey, who were counsel
for Canfield. and his alleged manager,
David Buckiin. Jerome says Jacobs
asked them that, as the price of his
confession, he be supplied with suffi
cient funds by Canfleld to take him
out of .the jurisdiction of the courts.
After being arrigned he made a fuller
confession to Jerome. It Is said . by
Jeromp that Jacobs would never have
been a- witness against Buckiin, and
the indictment against Canfleld has al
ready been quashed.
: The arrangements for the arrest of
Jacobs was made by Britt and General
Tracey, in consultation with Jerome.
Both Britt and'General Tracey refused
, to discuss the confession of Jacobs,
declaring that they, had^ pledged their
word to Jerome that th'ey. would dis
close none of the circumstances.
'If this suit were brought," said
Judge. Wood, "by Turner, who was the
maker of the note, the court would
probably not grant any relief."
The testimony submitted to Judge
Wood showed that on November. 22,
1900, Charles H. Turner, then president
of the St. Louis and Suburban Com
pany, borrowed from the German Sav
ings Institution the sum of $75,000, for
which he executed two notes. Nicho
laus, as one of the Suburban Company
directors, authorized the loan, indors
ing the notes on which the money was
secured.
The monev thus obtained \ was de
posited in a box in the safety vault
of the Lincoln Trust Company, to be
used in bribing members of the House
of Delegates to procure the passage of
an ordinance for the laenefit of the Su
burban Street Railway Company. One
key to the box was held by Philip Stock,
as legislative, or financial agent of the
Suburban Company, and the other by
John K. Murrell. business agent of the
House of Delegates combine. These
facts from time to time came out in. the
testimony of former President Turner
and other witnesses in the trials of
various members of the House of Dele
gates convicted of bribery, and : in : the
confessions of members of the House
combine who turned State's evidence.
Judge Wood in his decision said â¢â
v "The fund in controversy does not
come within the law of escheats, and
could not be appropriated by the State
under the statute relating to escheats,
nor can it be confiscated by the State."
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 22.â Judge Wood of
the Circuit Court, in the case of Henry
Nlcolaus, a director' of the Suburban
Railway Company, against Charles H.
Turner, formerly president of the Su

Savings Institution, Ellis Wainwright
and others, decided to-day that the
plaintiff was entitled to recover $75,000,
the boodle fund placed on deposit with
the Lincoln Trust Company by the
Suburban Railway Company, to bribe
members of the House of delegates,
for the reason that "Mr. Nicolaus was
ignorant of the purposes for which the
money was to be applied."

The twenty-five members of the
First Regiment Band, National Guard,
marched into court and then marched
out again with their little grievance
against Colonel Thomas F. O'Neil.
Judge Murasky in a brief but pointed
opinion disposed of the case of Pay
son et al. against the colonel by de
"clding that they had not taken the
proper course â that is, carried their
troubles to the commanding officer â
and until they did the' courts ,woiild
not interfere. He sustained the de
murrer to the complaint and dis
charged the restraining order. issued in
September to prevent the colonel from
discharging the bandmen "for the
good of the service." In asking for
the injunction the men also demanded
$12,000 damages for. loss of prospec
tive pay and injured reputations.
The difficulties begun before the
regiment went to Camp Atascadero.
Colonel O'Neil let Chief Musician
George Hollister out "for good of the
service." Hollister demanded his
music sheets and other property and
sued the colonel for $50 in the Jus
tices' Court for property retained. He
lost. Then the other bandmen, fearing
a like discharge and maintaining that
they could not be let out "dishonor
ably" without court-martial, brought
the Injunction suit. Colonel O'Neil
said yesterday that there was nothing
in the '"book" relating to discharge
"for good of the service," but it had
been practiced for fifteen years and
custom makes law. He would not say
what he would do, as a new colonel
was to be elected last night, but inti
mated that there might be something
in the wind before his successor quali
fl eg â about three weeks hence.
, The annual election of officers for
i the First Regiment of Infantry, Na
tional Guard of California, was held
at the armory, Page and Gough
streets, last night and resulted in the
election of. Major George Filmer to
the rank of colonel, Major Thomas J.
McCreagh as lieutenant colonel, Cap
tain Frank Eggert as major. The vote
for second major was a tie between
Captain George T. Ballinger and Cap
; tain Walter S. Kelly. After the elec
; tion the newly elected officers ad
! journed to a nearby cafe and partook
I of a banquet. -
So much contradictory evidence was |
introduced in the case of Spider Kelly. ;
accused of having assaulted Count j
Neils Bonde of the Royal Life Guards, :
StÂ»ckholm, Sweden, that the commls- j
sioners decided to take a week to think
the matter over. The Count took the j
stand and told how Kelly had struck j
him with a cane while he and his friends j
were innocently watching a fight j
between two women. He was corrobo
rated by his friend Charles Holling
worth. Kelly denied having struck any
one with his cane, but said they had !
insulted a woman and he had given
one of them a shove and urged them
to move on. Benjamin Ferguson, a
bartender, stood by the Spider.
Charles Dahl sold short drinks in a j
restaurant on the Ocean Boulevard
and was given two weeks In which to j
dispose of his license. :
The licenses of Charles A. Engelman I
of 205 Fourth street and John A. Carl- I
son of 204 Fifth street were revoked j
as their places were run in a disorderly j
manner. 1
By a unanimous vote of the Police
Commissioners the license of S. Con
stantinl, proprietor of the Tortoni
restaurant. Ill O'Farrell street. wÂ»s
revokejii last night. The action was
taken on a complaint made by M. P.
Scott, business agent of the Cooks'
and Waiters' Union, who alleged that
the restaurant was not being conduct
ed in a moral manner. As witnesses
he called two waiters, each bearing
the name of Peterson, who told of a
night of revelry in the old resort.
Thgy took a room and one of the Pe
tersons represented to the waiter that
the other Peterson was a "good thing
just down from the north." On this
tip the waiter very obligingly sent
out for two ladies to join the Peter
sons at dinner. Chief Wlttman testi
fied that he had warned Constantlni
against permitting his waiters to send
out for women. Attorney Bush Fen
nell represented the innkeeper and
sought to show that the Tortoni was a
respectable family resort where hus
bands took their wives to enjoy French
dinners. In the face of the evidence
his plea was of no avail and Constan
tini was ordered to close at once.

to whom it was sold. A vigorous and

the name of the owner of the weapon.
The cartridges found in the weapon

"center fire." Those alleged to have

Eaid to be "rim fire."

fcpainst the holding of his client on the
.charge of murder. He contended that

Adolph Wober is beginning to show
the <?ffÂ«vts of the strain he has been
tinder for the last fortnight. lie looks
th<n and careworn and complains that
he is not feelinsr well. To a Call corre
spondent to-day he stated that his in -

he had been eating too much and suf
fered for the want of exercise. A set
of boxlnjf gloves was brought to the
jail to-day. Every morning hereafter,
while his confinement lasts, they will
be donned by Weber and Jailer Fulton.
Coroner Shepard is of the opinion
that Weber, after committing the ter
rible crime, ivent to the barn and hid
the weapon, choosing the hiding place
with the idea of returning for the
weapon ; when . opportunity offered.
This theory of the Coroner, it is be
];<ved, is borne out by the fact that
voung Weber before Tiis arrest was
et-en in the neighborhood of the barn
by emissaries of the Coroner and the
Sheriff, whose duty it was to keep an
eyÂ« on the only surviving member of
the Weber family. It 13 said that
Weber while on his way to the barn
became cognizant of the fact that he
was being shadowed and when within
3 00 yards of th<? structure turned and
retraced his steps. -
AUBURN, Nov. 11. â The pistol
from which sped the bullets that
brought death to the members of the
Weber famUy has been found. It was
located to-day in the basement of a
barn on the Weber property. The
weapon, which is blood encrusted, and
to which adheres a tuft of hair, sup
posedly that of little Earl Weber, was
ft und on a sill about nine feet from
the entrance to the barn. It is a cheap
weapon of the Iver-Johnson make ana
32-caliber. The five chambers of the
pistol were empty.
Young Weber was in court when the
nrws of the discovery of the weapon
was made known. Every eye was
upon him when the announcement was
made. Its affect upon him was start
ling. He turned deathly pale, squirm
ed about in his seat and nervously
firgerod the pencil with which he was
taking notes of the evidence being of
fered. With what appeared to be a
violent effort he controlled himself,
and, after a few furtive glances about
the courtroom, resumed his self-im
posed task of taking notes.

Nearly two hundred tenants of the
Hayward building-, at the northeast
corner of California and Montgomery
streets, have risen in stern protest
against the proposed action of their
new landlady, Mrs. Sarah Kohl. Since
she purchased the property she be
lieves the fact should be emphasized
and Intends to tack her own name
above the door. Accordingly* her
agents have sent forth the word that
the name "Hayward building" dies
with the old year and the "Kohl
building" goes upon the books. Upon
receipt of this information yesterday
an indignation meeting was held, and
in less than an hour every tenant had
signed a letter of objection.
The tenants sav that their principal
objection to such an action would be
the loss of their identity in location.
They say also that gTeat loss would
be entailed by the altering of sta
tionery and such matter which has
been prepared for the present build
ing. One insurance company alone
has ordered calendars, blotters and
stationery to the value of $3000 indi
cating- that their location is In the
Hayward building, and all this would
be a Loss.
For Business Reasons They Object to
Proposed Rechrlstenins of the
Place.

And go out they did and got his horses all
out. so that none of them was burned, al
though he suffered otherwise a total loss.
Soar I caH that a practical application ot
Mr. Warner's teachings. Here In Washington
we have a right to be proud of a citizen like
Mr. Downey, and if only we can develop
enough such citizens we shall turn out jost
the kind of community that does not n#ed to
but will always be glad to study "The Simple
Life." the author of which I ncrw introduce
to you.
"Now you women stay here aad pray, and
3-ou men go straight out and help cur bene
factor, Mr. Downey."
But, unfortunately, we know- that the towar
of Siloam often falls upon tbe Just and the
unjust alike and ilr. Downey's livery stable
caught are and burned down. It was said that
that morning the Baptist church was in ses
sion next door to him and the clergyman
stocced and said :
with; the trustees cf h!fc church and said that
they very much appreciated Mr. Downey's
courtesy and were sorry they had bothered
him as they had, because, on looking Into tha
alalrs of the church, they found that as they
were already in debt they did not feel war
ranted ia incurring any further obligations
and so they had to withdraw their request.
They thanked him for his kindly purpose and
said good-by.
But Mr. Downey found he could not get to
sleep that night until finally he made up his
mind that as they could not buy it hÂ» would
give It to them anyway, which he did.
As aa example of what can be done and
Â¦could be done by the individual, I shall men
tion something that recently occurred In this
city cf Washington â a thing that doubtless
many ef yoa kacw about, but which was un
known to me until recently. A few weeks agr>.
when I was wa iking back from church oce
Sunday, I noticed a great fire and found that
it was Downey's Uvery stable â you reccllect It
three or fair weeks ago. Through & train
of clrcasistances that I will not mention
nsy attention was particularly called to thÂ«
case Â«"<< I locked into is. I had long known
of the very admirable wcrk dene with singu
lar modesty and self-effacement by Mr. Dow
ney ia trying to give homes to and to be
himself a friend ol those In a sense friendless
in thiJ community, and I by accident found
cut wfcst happened In connection with this par
ticular incident.
It appears that last spring Mr. Downey start
ed to build a new stable. His stable Is next
doer to a colored Baptl* church. Mr.' Downey
Is a waits nsan and a Catholic, and these
neighbors of his are colored and Baptists, and
their kinship was simply the kinship- of that
broad humanity that should undÂ»Ue all our
feeling* toward one another. Mr. Dowa-y
started to build tis stable, and. naturally
er.<n:gh. wanted to Have ft as. big a stable as
pcft>ible and build It right np to the limits of
his land. That brcujht the wall close up
agalrst the back of the colored church, cut
ting out the light and air.
The preacber called npoa him aad totd him
that they would Lika to purchase a strip six
feet broad of the sroand cf Mr. Downey upon
which he was intending to build, as it would
be a great inconvenience to them to lose the
light and air; that they were aware It was
ackin? a good deal of him to cramp the bui'd
!nÂ« cut of which he Intended to make hi* Uv
irg.. bat they hoped he would do It because
of their need. After a gocd deal of thought
Mr. Duwney came to tbe conclusion that he
ought t-: grant the request, aad so he notified
thrm that he wcnld change his plans, make
a somewhat smaller building and sell them the
Â¦tx feet cf Land In the strip- adjoining their
catirea.
After a Itttla while tbe preacfasr came around
LIVERYMAN'S KINDLY ACT.
I intend to Illustrate by a coupie of exam
ples what I- mean by a man acting Individ
ually and what I mean by a man acting in as
sociations with hiÂ« fellows. I hesitated
whether I wecid tise, as I shall cae, the nanw-s
of the people whom I meant, bai I came to the
conclusion that I weald, because the worth of
an example consists very largely in an under
standing that the example is a real one.
I have been Interested for a number cf years
ta the working of the Civic Oab In New York,
which has been started ami superintended by
Ncrton Goddard. It Is a club on the east side
of New York City, the range cf whose mem
bership Includes a big district extending from
I>exlng-cn avenue to the East River. Mr. God
dart realised that ruch work can be done to
tbe beat advantage only upon condition of there
being hearty sympathy ameng these doing It.
There are a great many people so made ta
this world (I think tnest of us come under
the category) that they would resect beln*
paircnlzed about as much as being wronged.
Great good can never bÂ« dene If it is attempt
ed in a patronizing spirit. Mr. Goidard real
ized that the work cocld be done e!t*ctlve!y
only ca condition of getting into close and
hearty touch with the people through whom,
and with whea he was to work. In ronse
c.uenc* this Civil Club was formed, and It has
gradually extended its operations until now
the entire club membership cf three cr four
thctieaad men practically forms a ccrcsjittiÂ»e
cf bettenrent la social and civic life; a com
mittee spread throughout that district, each
member keeping a sharp lookout over the for
tune* cf all his Immediate neighbors There
fore any caÂ«e cf destitution. o( great suffer
ing, la the district, csines to the attention of
scmÂ« member ef the club, who then report*
it at bÂ«s.<iÂ«TuartersL so that steps can be taken"
to alleviate the misery; Â«n<i I have reason to
believe that there has been la consequence â¢
TÂ»ry general uplifting, a general increase of
happiness throughout the district.
If we had a sufficient nua:b*r of clubs cf
this kiad throughout cur great cities, while we
would not by Â¦ any means have solved all the
terriile problems that presa upon us fcr solu
tion la connection with municipal mlsgovern
oÂ«nt and the overcrowding, misery, vice, dis
ease and poverty of great ciri"S. yet we would
have taken a long stride forward In the right
direction toward their solution. So much for
the example that I use to illustrate what I

BROTHERHOOD OF 3IAX.
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.â President

ed a lecture on "The Simple Life." In
presenting the author to the audience
the President said in' part:

that it is not usually the ryct principle of the

brought out the great fuolirnental truth that

, LONDON, Nov. - 22.â There could "not
be a more significant lesson for play
makers than the success of "The
Walla of Jericho," by Alfred Sutro.
presented by Arthur Bourchier and
Violet Vanbrugh this week. The work
stands at the opposite pole from Pine
ro's play at Wyndham's Theater, al
most next door. It ia. often clumsy and
uncertain in construction, much of the
"smart dialogue" Is machine made, the
situations are conventional and almost
as far away from Pinero as a play
wright could get without cutting him
self off from all hope of production in
a fashionable theater.
And yet this work by .a comparative
ly unskilled dramatist- lives, and as
suredW will go on living for many a
night after "A Wife Without a Smile."
the latest work of the deftest English
playwright, has been withdrawn. And
it is all because Sutro" had something
to say that was worth saying. It wasn't j
anything new, but it was sincere and
forceful and straightforward and dra
matic. It appealed to the moral sense
of the audience, and. moreover, the
message was delivered through a good, I
old-fashioned, honest hero, whom one |
could respect. There is life yet it seems j
In the old-style stage hero.
HERO IX REBELLION'.
Arthur Bourchier takes the part of i
Jack Frobisher, a solid, strong-hearted j
Australian millionaire of humble orf- 1
gin. who has made his "pUe," come to :
London, married the frivolous daugh- ,
ter of a vicious old Marquis and become j
quite tame. He pays his wife's gam- i
bling debts without demur, and even
tries to tolerate an admirer with whom
she flirts perilously, until the young
man actually insults her. Then there
is the usual sort of scene, and Jack
Frobisher becomes a Joshua and blows *
his trumpet at the walls of Jericho â the
London smart set.
"I am sick of your friends," he shout3
to his wife. "I am sick of these, sexless
women, gambling, betting, chattering
scandal, flirting with one another's hus-
I bands and grudging the very time
spent in bringing children into the
world. To hell with the whole lot of
them!"
He will go back to Australia, where
men and women are real and decent
and earnest, and his wife and their
little boy shall go with him. Mrs.
Frobisher says she* will do no such
thing, and her husband prepares-- co
"go without her, taking- the boy. Of
course at the last moment It appears
that Mrs. Frobisher has a heart. She
hadn't indicated any affection for the
tame husband, but this new side of
him appeals to her, and the final cur
tain leaves them bound for Australia
together.
There was little individuality in the
characters as Indicated by the author,
but as interpreted by Bourchier and
Violet Vanbrugh the parts of Mr. and
Mrs. Frobisher at least were realities,
contributing largely to the success of
the play.
SHAWS XEAV OFFERING.
No one who saw "Candida." "Arms
and the Man" or "The Devirs Dis
' ciple" will need to be told that Ber
nard Shaw's new play, which has Just
been produced at the Court, is the ex
act antithesis of Sutro's. No one ever
yet accused Shaw of beins con
ventional, and "John Bull's Other Isl
and." in which great interest 13 being
taken here, is in his most fantastic
vein. One rather doubts If it will be
given in the United States. It depends
for its effectiveness too much on local
and topical allusions, and there ts
even less story than is usual in Shaw's
plays. Still, If the dramatist's trans-
Atlantic admirers succeed In getting
1 an American production of his newest
; piece of trifling their efforts will not
i go uncompensated. for -"John Bull*3
Other Island" is full of bits such as
probably no one but Bernard Shaw
could have written.
There is an especially pretty episode
In which an ex-priest has an animated
dialogue with a grasshopper, and "a
capital piece of polished buffoonery In
; which a pig is given a ride in a motor
car. Brilliant sallies are many.
"Never mind my heart," says Larry
Doyle. "An Irishman's heart Is noth
ing but his Imagination." And a cer
'â¢ tain candidate's snobbish spouse, who
objects to shaking hand3 with "com
mon people." Is told that "for an M.
P.'s wife, no one is common whose
name is on the polling list."
There is an exchange of repartee,
too, between a cockney valet and an
embittered Irish farmer, in which the
valet tells the farmer that, there are
worse evictions in London than ever
' there were is Roscullen.
"But thank goodnes3," he adds,
"Englishmen are free!"

except In one place, where he per
mits himself to be more serious than
perhaps he ever has been before. This
is when one of the Irish characters
named Keegan. an idealist, is asked to
describe the heaven of his dreams. He
replies:
"In my dreams it Is a country
where the state ia the church and the
church the people, three in one and
one in three; it is a commonwealth in
which work is play and play is life.
three in one and one in three; it Is a
temple in which the priest is the wor
shiper and the worshiper the wor
shiped, three in one and one in three;
the Godhead in which all the life Is
human and all humanity divine, three
in one and one in three."
That passage must have tome
straight from the author's heart and
the way In which It is delivered has
made a strong impression on all who
have seen the play.

*I am in favor.** said Secretary Shaw,
~cf sending for prominent agitators for
tariff revision and asking each what
schedules he vroold modify. My own
impression is that when all of them
had been heard from not mere than
tw enty articles would be touched. But
this question is coming vi-p and it Is
proper that we should have the fullest
discussion. The recent election was
'a stand pat' victory and if the tariff
is to be amended it will b* amended in
accordance with the view* of the
'stand ratters."
â¢The friends of the tariff wCl be con
sulted and it will be made clear that
the administration has not been driven
Into this position by the men who ad

Secretary Shaw expressed himself in
favor cf a radical modification of the
tariff act only so far as it related to

Forty-eight members of the senior i
clars at the State University breathed
earier to-day when they received let- ,
tors fmm Recorder Sutton. informing
.them th?.t .instead of expulsion from
the military class they â¢ are to be
"placed on probation," as a result of
thrlr conduct in connection with the
campus riot which followed Captain
Xance's order requiring them to march
in soldierly fashion into ills classroom. ;
Captain Nance reported yesterday to ;
President Wheeler cm the cases of the:
forty-elsht men in question and the
president ' promptly directed that no
tices be sent the mÂ«n, informing them
that they are on probation, and will
be expelled In the event of future dis
obedif nee. 'Â¦â¢' ~
Fifteen men are still on the anxious
peat and Captain Nance has as yet made
no report regarding them. Each of
the fifteen imagines that he is likely
to be recommended for dismissal. W.
T. Hale, editor of the Daily Callfor
nian. is one of the fifteen. The names 'Â¦
of the "forty-eisht" and of the 'â¢fif
teen" as well, are withheld by the uni
versity authorities.
Recorder Sutton's letter to each man
of the â¢forty-eight" reads as follows:
jji- df>ar Â»:r â The prfsldtnt directs me to
DOtUy -vou that en account o* delinquency in
covrfÂ» *"A ir. military science and tactics, you
art htreby placed on probation until further
notics. According to Joint regulations 7*J of
th.- acaurn:ic faculties, "probation Indicateg
that thv EiJd^nt Is in danger of expulsion from
the university." . â ,_

"lrougbt against- >' ( ' u b >' the professor of mili
tary science and tactics has been accepted as
satisfactory-' Your explanation as to part ta)
is not satisfactory.
I am 4i*eetfed further to Inform you that the
pimieliratnt decided upen In your case, is the
mildest possible under the circumstances; It Is
nctb*Heve<l to-be an adequate punishment for
the offense ccnimilted, but It may prove suffl
o'.cr.t to bring about h state of proper military
discipline In the clats In question.
President Wheeler directed to-day <
that the following statement be issued
in explanation of the report received
by him from Captain Nance yester
day.'. The statement is as follows:
Captain Nance yesterday filed with the preÂ«
lder.t hiÂ» rÂ«porÂ» concerning; the students accused
of delinquency In military 2A. Sixty-three -stu
dents had been given an opportunity to stata :
their civse In full. Only one of them. had offered
explanations -which were entirely satisfactory.
Forty-elKht offered explanations which were ,
satisfactory as far as their participation in the
disorder was concerned, but unsatisfactory as
far as explanation of their failure to proceed j
promptly to the class was concerned. These ;
were, therefore, placed on probation. , "This
punishment, or censure," the captain says. In
his report to the president, "Is the mildest pos
slb!?. It 1* recommended In the belief that It
irill prove suinclent to bring about a slat- of
j.rcr*r military discipline In this class (which
is the t r.d to be attained) and not In the be
lief that it is. generally speaklnfr, an adequate
puniÂ«hment for the offtnse committed."
Fifteen cases ara held for further investiga
tion. Report and recommendations In thalr
cases will be submitted to the president a*
soon as practicable. Among these are Included
a number who have not as yet given a satis
factory explanation on the score of participa
tion In the disorder. '^

sanely jealous of her, and when she was
writing a letter home to her mother he
accused her of writing to a man. On

ALAMEDA, . Nov. 22.â When the
Board of Firemen and Engineers of the

night the affairs of an oi ganlzation
that has served the city well for nearly ;
thirty years were practically wound up. '
Beginning next month the apparatus
; that has heretofore been operated by |
volunteers wlli,. be. In c-narge of men
who will be paid for the work. There
will le four men for each hose wagon
instead of fifteen, and twenty as at
present.
It was decided at the meeting last
night to use the $100 in the/treasury
of the volunteer department to pur
chase a patent air masK ror fire fight

With the disbandment of the volun
teer department the three remaining
hose companies will cease to exist.
These organizations are Thompson

I have b*Â«n shamefully treated, and I believe
justice should be mttod out to those responsi
ble. I am now preparing: my evidence against

complete 1 shall mibmit it to Marshal Kerns of
Bei ke!ey and ask him to act. We are tracing
thÂ«? crlsln of th-? telephone menages I received
on the night when I was uup- I, and when that
oriein Is known our evidence will be complete.
1 understand that th* youth whom I believe
conducted this wretched practical joke Is a
senior in the university, and that he recently
brapgrd of his jck? to a party en the campus.
That e.vldencf. too, I hope to get, and I am
now working on it. I ar.i not revengeful, but
I belUve it is my duty to see that an outrage

the offender!! are punished or suitable repara
tion is made. ,
The address given to Dr. Moore was
in a fashionable residence section of
Berkeley, but it was rather indefinite,
as she was told to call at the "second
door from the' corner" on a certain
street for a "Mr. Martin." Dr. Moore,
hcwever. donned her wraps and went
out into the , night on her errand of
mercy, but upon reaching the house
described found it In total darkness.
She rang the bell, aroused the family
and said: "I understand you require
my services for the lady of the house."
"We certainly ! do not," replied the
astonished man at the door. "There
must be a mistake somewhere."
Dr.. Moore, believing that It was her
duty to sacrifice natural inclinations
and feelings, went to the next house,
thinking she might have made an
error, and there repeated her inquiry.
She was informed that a physician's
services of the sort which Dr. Moore
proffered were not needed. Again did
the doctor make inquiry at still an
other house with similar result and
after. that gave up the quest and re
turned to her rooms in disgust.
In a few minutes she was called -up
again by telephone arid told that she
must' hasten to the home of the,
speaker who had originally summoned
hef , as the patient was likely to . die
unless medical assistance was Instantly
forthcoming. More definite directions
v.ere obtained by Dr. Moore this time
and she sallied forth again, only to re
peat the humiliating experiences she
had undergone before-
Returning again to her home the
telephone bell once more rang and then
she was informed that the wife of the
man who/ Had spoke had been taken
care of by amateurs and that "rolling
pins" had been used in. lieu of a sur
geon's instruments. The Bpeaker ap
parently was sincere.
She learned a few days later that
she had been made the victim of a
practical joke and was informed that
two university students were 'the of r
fenders. She called them to her office
and asked them to pay the customary
fe<* In such cases or suffer prosecution.
They denied responsibility for the af
fair, but Dr. Moore was convinced of
trfeir guilt and is now planning to
prosecute them. She said to-day:
Detectives are at work for the tele
phone company in an attempt to trace
the perpetrators of an extraordinary
practical joke upon Mrs. E. D. Moore,
a prominent woman physician of
Berkeley, who recently was made the
Victim of what she believed was the
attempt at humor of some university
student and now seeks to punish those
who made her suffer.
Dr. Moore lives at 2034 Shattuck
avenue. A few nights ago the tele
phone bell in her home rang and she
was then informed over the wire that
her professional services were required
instantly by the wife of the man who
stood at the other end of the line.
"Come at once, doctor!" said the
speaker, apparently very much ex
cited.

Having settled the question as to the
Wililamses. the detectives ceased oper
ations on the case, saying they would
leave the haunted house to take care
of Itself. ThSy believe the noises will
stop, now that the aged couple have
been found alive.
A month ago John "Williams and his
spouse suddenly dropped out of sight
after occupying for some time the
dwelling at 652 Jackson street. The
couple's absence was noticed a week
or so ago, when the neighbors were
much disturbed about what seemed to
be supernatural visitations at the va
cant house. Moanings/and groanings
kept the folks thereabouts awake of
nights and gave rise to no end of spec
ulation. Daring ones explored the place.
Not a trace of its former occupants
could be found. Moreover a pile of
newly turned earth in the back yard
caused great consternation. Had the
two old people been foully murdered?
Had their slain corpses been thrown
ruthlessly into a grave hastily dug In
the yard *.o conceal evidence of a hor
rible crime?
These questions appealed so vividly
to the startled neighbors, already In a
tumult of excitement, that one of them,
Mrs. Carl Knauth, residing near by, de
cided to call In the police. Chief Hodg
kins was enlisted and Detectives Quigr
ley and Shorey were detailed to uncover
the mystery. They went to work. The
first day they dug over the back yard,
but found no murdered bodies. But this
did not account for the disappearance
of the 'Winiamses. So a week passed In
running down clews until success at
last rewarded the two trailers. Out at
the County Infirmary they located Mrs.
Williams. She gave the pair informa
tion that her absent spouse was alive
and well, working In a Mendocino
County logging camp. This was veri
fied this afternoon.
The mysterious disappearance of a
husband and "his wife, the finding of a
mound of fresh earth; strange, weird
noises at midnight; lights flashing In
ghostly fashionâ these and more dis
turbing signs gave rise to a tale of
murder, secret burial and haunted
premises that the police had been
working on for a week, only to bring: it
to a prosaic ending to-day.

The State of California is entitled to
$31,746 30 from William J. and Rob
ert L. Douglas of Nevada, heirs of the
late J. M. Douglas, according to the
report of Edward C. Harrison, who
was appointed as appraiser of the col
lateral inheritance tax due from the
estate. . Mr. Harrison recited all of the
legal proceedings gone through since
October 6 to determine the value of
the estate, which was removed from
this city to Nevada by the heirs. After
overcoming the difficulties he dis
covered that Douglas left property in
this State valued at $642,207 20, and
with allowance for expense of admin
istration and other things, the dis
tributive portion subject to the tax
would be $634,926 17, which was left
share and share alike to the two heirs.
The largest item of value was that of
12,200 Spring Valley shares, appraised
at $488,000.
The objections of the heirs to the
taxation in this State were attached
to the report. They contended that
Douglas had for twenty years been a
resident of Virginia City, New, and
was here on a visit when he was taken
ill and died. Tfye property consisted
of stocks and bonds on deposit in bank
and they aver that in law it was owned
at his place of residence in Nevada
and therefore could not be taxed here.
They* hold also that as there has been
no decree, of distribution it could not
be determined what amount was due.

CHICAGO, Nov. 22.â No clews devel
oped to-day in the case of the murder
of Chauffeur Bate, who was killed
three days ago. The officers are stlH
seeking diligently for Dove, the man
who hired the automobile, but appar
ently have not succeeded in gaining
any knowledge of his whereabouts. The
case has settled down to a man hunt,
with few facts upon which the search
can be directed.
John Henness, the young man who,
last night and this morning, was
thought to have valuable information
regarding the murder, has 'announced
that he knows nothing of it. He was
credited with statements to the effect
that he had seen the murder; that he
had seen the flash of the revolver and
heard the shots that took the life of
Bate, but later he declared he had seen
none of these things. To-night, how
ever, he said he saw an automobile pass
along the road and that it contained
three people. After it had passed him
by about a quarter of a mile he heard
two shots, but paid no attention to
them until the next morning when he
heard of the murder. This story. Hen
ness says, is the truth. He declared
that the reason why he denied his first
story was that he was walking with a
young woman whose parents had ob
jected to his being with her and he did
not wish to create any trouble for her.

NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â Suit has been
brought by Paul Fuller of this city
against Thomas W. Lawson of Boston
for $350,000. Fuller, who is an attor
ney, said that he himself was the
plaintiff in the suit, but as to the na
ture of the proceedings, or the cause,
he declined to have anything to say.
It was reported that Lawson's recent
writings had caused the bringing of
the suit, but this was denied by Fuller.
The latter is a member of the law firm
of Coudert Brothers. Lorenzo Semple
of the law firm said that the suit was
over a private transaction between
Lawson and Fuller, and had nothing
to do with the Boston man's writings.
BOSTON, Nov. 22.â Thomas W. Law
son issued to-night a signed statement,
which, however, beyond the inference
contained in the opening sentence,
throws little light upon the origin or
nature of the suit or suits brought
against him. Lawson refers to pres
sure being brought at Washington in
an effort to exclude from the mails his
writings on finance. He expresses the
opinion that such a proceeding would
not be permitted by the postal authori
ties. Says he:
DENVER. Nov. 22.â A special officer
of the Supreme Court started out to
day with ten additional warrants for
persons charged with violating the or
der of the court, appointing special
watchers on election day and according
them the same privileges guaranteed
to regular watchers under the election
laws. Six arrests of local Democratic
leaders were made, their names being
William H. Green of the city detective
force; James Mullins, a clerk in the
Treasurer's office; James Harris, a Dis
trict Court bailiff: Patrick Reid, a
county constable; William Bergman
and Mart Devapey. They were all re
leased on bonds of $1000.
The local political contest reached the
Federal Court late this afternoon when
Otto J. Weimer and L, Abramowsky,
Republicans, swore to complaints
charging Democratic workers and elec
tion officials with ejecting them from
polling booths,. thereby preventing them
from voting. Eight arrests resulted, all
being released later In bonds of $2000
each. The men arrested are Mike Ma
honey, Alderman;- Frank Kratke, ser
geant of police; Charles Kovsky, police
man; Edward O'Maila, Joseph Ray,
William Schradsky. Max Schorowsky
and Max Sissek.
The charge in the warrants Is based
on section 550S of the United States
statutes, which guarantees the right to
vote for Presidential Electors and Rep
resentatives to Congress.

It wes disclosed that she once com
piled an impromptu dismissal of the
Visitacion Valley Public School by her
invasion thereof in quest of vengeance
for the deserved punishment of the
very boy whose fistic encounter with
the Gamboggi boy led to her Amazon
ian attack upon Mrs. Gamboggi. So
the Jud^e dismissed the charge against
Mrs. Gamboggi. pronounced Mrs. Go
tella guilty of peace disturbance and
promised to sentence her to-day.
Visitacicn Valley was numerously
represented In Judge Conlan's court,
i\ here Mrs. Maria Gotella and Mrs. Jes
sie Gamboggi accused each other of
disturbing the r>eace. Each of the la
dies was accompanied by a crowd of
matrons ready and willing to testify in
her behalf, but the Judge mercilessly
disappointed most of the ladies by hear
ing only what the two principals and
their respective blood relatives had to
say.
There was no dispute as to the origin
of the conflict, both sides conceding
that it was a fight between the Gotella
boy and the Gamboggi boy. but of the
subsequent proceedings there was no
statement that went unprotested. Mrs.
Gamboggi and her witnesses swore
positively that she did nothing, either
by word or deed, to warrant the attack
made upon her by Mrs. Gotella, who
knocked her down and kicked her
while prcstra'te. Mrs. Gotella and her
contingent averred, on the other hand,
that no living saint could have avoid
ed retaliating with violence for the
tongue-lashing administered by Mrs.
Gamboggi to the entire Gotella family.
Moreover. Mrs. Gotella did not knock
Mrs. Gamboggi down, nor did she in
dulge in kicking. Her assault upon
Mrs. Gamboggi was strictly confined to
hair-pulling. Nor did Mrs. Gamboggi
supinely submit to having her coiffure
disarranged. In the clinch she did
some severe sh<">rt-arm-work.
So radical, indeed, was the conflict
of testimony that the court was obliged
to resort to record-raking, and that's
â¢where Mrs. Gotella came out second

Gamboggi withstood the fierce rays of
the police searchlight without wilting
in the least, the same Investigatory
process ruthlessly shattered Mrs. Go-
Police Judge Mogan has taken the
written complaint and the demurrer
under consideration.
"May it please the court," he said,
"the verbiage of this document makes
it Incompetent. It charges the defend
ant with 'willfully and unlawfully tor
menting a certain animal, to wit, a
horse, overloading said horse and abus
ing the same.' These allegations are at
variance with the testimony of the
complaining witness, Humane Officer
Hooper, who has just swore that the
horse was not carrying a load, but was
attached to a wagon laden with trunks.
Therefore, your Honor, my client is not
guilty of "overloading said horse' un
less he gave the animal too much food,
which, I will confess, the great kind
ness cf his nature might have led him
to do. Again, the prosecuting witness
testified that the defendant swore at
the horse, said swearingr being speci
fied in this complaint as 'abusing the
same.' Now, as my client cannot
English and the horse driven by him
v as an American horse, could oaths ut
tered in a language unintelligible to
their object be reasonably â I will not
say legally â designated 'abusing the
same'? If the horse did not understand
what the man saM to him. how could
the horse have been abused by what
the man said? We will concede that
the defendant swore at the horse, but
we object to having said swearing
termed 'abusing the same.' I move for
dismissal on the ground of the general
ambiguity of the formal charge."
After carefully scanning the formal
complaint In which B. Oshi, a Japanese
teamster, was accused of cruelty to
animals, the attorney for the defense
entered an oral demurrer.
J. P. Mitchell, who on September 21)
held up two messengers of the Central
Grain and Stock Exchange and ob
tained a dress suit case containing
57000. was held to answer In the Supe
rior Court, with bail fixed at $10,000. by
Judge Conlan. Three thousand dollara
of the stolen money was recovered.
Francis P. Tully of Alameda reluct
antly confessed that he had been ar
rested for drunkenness in this city three
distinct times, and Judge Conlan sen
tenced him to remain here thirty days.
"It will be a good thing for you,"
said his Honor to, Mr. Tully, "for ac
cording to your own confession you
cannot visit . this city and stay sober.
My object in sending you to jail for a
month is to break you Into a habit of
sojourning: here and retaining your
senses."
Mr. Tully did not seem to relish the
extraordinary Judicial Interest mani
fested In effecting his reformation.
Elgin Trumbo, a young fellow who
came from Colusa. engaged an apart
ment at an Ellis street hotel and was
arrested for firing a pistol shot at a
bellboy who peeped at him through
the door transom, was dismissed with
a reprimand by Judge Conlan. The boy
said he did not know the bellboy was
at the transom when the pistol acci
dentally exploded while he was loading
it, and the Judge said the boy had no
right to have a loaded pistol In his pos
session.
Nicolas Sternoff, a butcher, pleaded
that he was seeking the Russian church
last Sunday when he met several little
girls on Stockton street and playfully
said to one chubby miss, "Hello, fatty."
So incensed was the young lady by the
appellation that she went home and in
formed her mamma that she had been
insulted, and mamma thereupon sum
moned a policeman and gave Mr. Stem
off into custody on the charge of dis
turbing the peace. Judge Mogan will
hear the other side of the case to-mor
row.
Peter Hawkins must answer in the
Superior Court the charge of assaulting
to murder Jacob Hacconi of 264 Clara
street by striking his head with an iron
bar. Judge Conlan fixed the defend
ant's bond at $2000.

John D. Christina, a boy accused of
breaking into the premises of Mr. Cen
ter, at Sixteenth and Folsom streets,
and stealing therefrom some pipes, will
be tried before Judge Mogan next Mon
day.
Michael Wheelihan was relieved by
Judge Conlan of the murder charge
that has bsen hanging over him
since August 20, when he was arrest
ed for killing Charles Lewis. The tes
timony showed that Lewis followed
and annoyed Wheelihan until the lat
ter pushed him away, when he fell,
his head striking. a curbstone with
such force as to fracture the skull.
The Coroner's jury exonerated Wheeli
han.
Juanita Besang, who almost sev
ered or.e of Munuela Pinto's fingers
by biting it. forfeited her bail and
departed for Porto Rico. At least
that is what was reported yesterday to
Judge Mogan. on whose calendar
Juanita was charged with battery.
The fight between the women was an
incident of the race war that has been
intermittently filtering into the Police
Court ever since the Porto Ricans in
vaded Pinckney alley with the al
leged deliberate intent to oust tha
Mexicans therefrom. Several other
batterj* cases evolved by the same fray
are on hearing.
George and Anastatia Ayer were in
toxicated when they, roamed the
streets all night, the woman carrying
their four-months-old babe, and in
the morning when they dropped into
the dwelling of her sister the little
one was dead., The father and mother
wore arrested and charged with cruel
ty to a minor child, and Judge Con-
Ian pronounced them guilty and de
ferred sentence till to-day.
Special Policeman Downey, who ar
rested a deaf mute in Chinatown and
charged him with disturbing the
peace, opined that the defendant was
cursing with his hands. 50 rapidly did
his fingers wiggle and so turbulent
was his general demeanor. As silent
profanity could not be proved a law
fracture, however, Judge Mogan dis
missed the case.
Mr. Schmoll and Miss Sinckey agreed
to unlock the trunk which was their
bone of contention and take therefrom
their personal belongings, the lady
to retain the receptacle. Mr. Schmoll
and Miss Sinckey were sweethearts
when they went together to New York,
where the gentleman abandoned the
lady, carrying away her trunk and
leaving her. as she aptly described her
predicament to Judge Fritz, "in an aw
ful pickle." It was Judge Fritz who
suggested that the contents of the
trunk be divided.

I bear thee on my eyes."
Similar ideas have always grouped
themselves about the shrine of love.
It was. among . the fragrant cedar
groves of Idallum that the laughter
loving Aphrodite liked to dwell, and
there the Graces three anointed her
with oil ambrosial. And between the
pillars of her SIdonian house of gold,
girls and boys, rose-crowned, sacri
ficed with smoke and incense, with
sighs and song, to win the fickle fa
vor of the queen of love.
And Grecian Helen's bower was
sweet with blossoms, with fragrant
leaves and crushed asphodel.
Everywhere in literature we find
this association of perfume with the
affections. It was a scientist, how
ever, who declared that it Is the fra
grance of woodland and garden that
makes the birds sing. It was a man
poet who wrote, in terms of sensuous
perception* the most exquisite descrip
tion that has ever been written of a
young girl's innocence; says Runeberg
of his village â¢ girl, "Her thoughts
were less words than a perfume."
But women, more often and more
beautifully than men, have spoken of
the haunting associations of sweet
odors. Writes one. the Amherst
poetess:
"Sleeping or sleepless â all the night
One dream bewitched of odors
sweet.
One dream of lilies clad in light â
Compels my spirit to their feet!
Of tall white lilies â faint and frail.
Whose breath beguiles to an abyss
Of midnight heaven, to inhale
Once more the jÂ» moon's delaying
kiss.
"I know not if their perfumes deep
Glad any. other garden dim.
But down a lover's path of sleep
They ever wake and watch for him!
Oh, tall white lilies clad in light!
Ghosts of remembered paradise,
: ETURNING violets! How strong
T^\ the perfumes bring
Iky/ The throb of passions past re-
I \ call! :^;'v^ : ;
\ The ashes of immortal spring
V Will smolder on within thy
fragile urn
Though love's blue flame in darkness
fall â
The signal torches cease to burn.
From the close and subtle relation
shop which exists between memory
and perfume it would seem as if Mo
hammed were Justified in calling
odors one of the two chief Joys of life,
and in ascribing to them a mystlo lan
guage of their own. A fragrance waft
ed from, a rose, the pungent scent of
summer balm, the honeyed breath of
clover bloom, may waken in the heart
a sleeping grief of long ago, or, by the
thought it brings of happier days,
may soothe a present sorrow,
t Memory's association with perfume
is one of the most fragrant mysteries,
of love's psychology. This so-called
"decadent sense of modern man" is
still, in youth's season of the affecs*
tlons, the most acute of all the senses.
To these Influences girls are espe
cially sensitive. Their, well-known
fondness for perfuming hair, breath,
garments and other belongings some
times amounts to a mania. Naturally
this peculiar susceptibility increases
under the excitement of emotion. And
so it comes about that often, in later
life, through the wonder and mys
tery of memory, certain perfumes will
carry them back to this love and blos
som season of youth.
Perfume has a sentimental influence
upon the masculine mind also. How
many a lover has felt his mood change
from gayety to tenderness under the
spell of the violets that his sweetheart
wore I How many a one has treasured
his lady's dainty glove more 'fondly
because Its fragrance reminded him of
the flower-like quality of its owner's
personality! The faint, sweet smell
of the jasmine flower clings with sen
suous charm about Owen Meredith/s
famous love poem, "Aux Italiens."

From beneath her long lashes she

A dramatic incident to mark the close
of the campaign and the election was
the declaration of President Roosevelt
that under no circumstances will he be
a candidate for or accept another nom
ination. The declaration of the Presi
dent is characteristic in that it is so
emphatic that no loophole is left for
evasion and interpretation. He means
exactly what he says, and he will do
exactly what he says. There will be no
question about this in the minds of the
American people, who know the Presi
dent now and who honor him on ac
count of the full, knowledge that they
have of him.â SeatUeiPost-Intelliffencer.
And now that this quadrennial party
dispute Is ended It Is believed that we
of the South who differed in political
belief with Mr. Roosevelt will accept
the situation with equanimity (and we
know how to do this, having had much
practice) and turn again to our daily
vocations, calm in the satisfaction that
the country is safely and sanely doing
business at the same old stand, and
that theres worry enough to go around
twice without our losing any sleep as
to the ultimate fate of the nation. â Gal

to radicalism and revolution. â Chicago
Chronicle. .
The defeat seems to be even more
emphatic than was anticipated. It
is not the purpose here to discuss the
whys and wherefores, but to merely
note the fact that for the tenth time
out of twelve the Democratic party has
met defeat. Defeat this time, however,
is without dishonor or discredit. As
to the future, it Is too early to discuss

THE PRESS OF THE NATION.
REPORTS from St. Petersburg aver that those high in the
councils of the Czar look with marked disfavor upon the re
sults of the election in the United States. The nervous diplo
mats of Russia take the overwhelming indorsement of President
Roosevelt to mean the policy this country has pursued in reference
to trade rights in Manchuria will be continued with unabating insist
ence instead of relaxed under a hoped-for Democratic regime. The
jealousy of the Muscovite is fanned anew by this expression of our
determination to continue claim to what is our share of tHe Oriental
trade.
It is not to be denied that Russia had reasonable hopes that the
accession to power of the Democrats would mean a retrenchment
on the part of this country. Considering the fact that the propa
ganda of the party in opposition included a loosening of our hold
on the Philippines and a consequent withdrawal from the theater
of trade activities in the Far East, Russia may well have had hopes
that an open or a closed door in China would have no effect upon the
policy of the United States under Democratic administration. But it
is not to be. The same administration that sent Consuls to Mukden,
Newchwang and Antung without asking leave of the Russian Gov
ernment will keep those officials there and see to it that the mar
kets of Manchuria remain open to American merchants.
In Russia's manifest disappointment lies a significant comment
upon the real essence of the Democratic platform's programme of
disavowal. Confidently expecting that a triumph of that party would
mean the withdrawal of the United States to a back seat in world
affairs, Russia was evidently preparing to reassert her bluff about
Manchuria whenever the settlement of the present difficulty over
there gave her opportunity. She indulged in an anticipatory wiping

"Is the apple crop good this year?"
she asked suddenly. "Have you
ground a lot of cider?"
For answer he dived into one of the
pockets of his shaggy gray coat and
fetched up a shining red apple.
"Thanks; it's a beauty," exclaimed
she, feeling of its smoothness.
"Came off your tree, Rose."
"My tree?"
"Yes; the immense one in the cor
ner â don't you remember? I've called
it your tree ever simie â since one day
when you were very little and you
wanted some blossoms."
"I suppose you got them for me,
if I wanted them?" said the girl soft
ly. How good he had always been to
her! He was Just like that shaggy
coat of his â big and rough and whole

Last night she had dreamed that
her head lay on that same shaggy
coat, that his strong arms were about

so well) he talked about the home
village, about the queer, poky little
streets and the dull village gossip.
How thin and white she had grown!
As she pushed aside the cheap Bagdad
portieres she seemed to be all gleaming

Bhe had sunshine in her hair and a
smile in her eyes. He had waited for
her to attain to womanhood, dreaming
dreams the villagers had never guessed.
And thenâ because she had talent for
art, forsooth, and her aunts had said
it must be cultivated, even though it
meant a third mortgage on their little
farm â she had passed out of his life.
Lately, however, John Lowell, had
caught a rumor that things were not
going well with her In the mad, com
petitive life of New York, and so he
was here!
And to-morrow would be Thanks

aunt's humble little farmhouse there
had ever been the entrancing odor of
pumpkin and mince pies, of stewed
cranberries, of browning turkey, of
plum pudding, of good things innumer

the colored girl, entered.

Down In the narrow, gaudy room a

lady compressed her lips as
though she had said a thing which it
hurt her to utter.
"I understand, indeed," the girl re
plied passively, pushing back her
heavy, gleaming hair with a little
gesture of weariness.
"Of course, to-morrow beln*
Thanksgivin' day, you needn't dis
turb yourself, but make yourself com
fortable till Friday." . She, looked at
the blank door which closed quietly
behind the girl. Then her eyes re
turned to the columns of her account
book. They were opened at a page
headed, "Miss Rose Darcey" â a page
where the debits considerably over
balanced the credits.
"I've too good a heart to be a suc
cessful business woman," murmured
the landlady, closing the book.
Jwilight was fast coming on. Up
stairs, in the fourth floor back there
was a flre In the grate â bright yellow
and scarlet flames, burning In a cease
less endeavor to destroy an asbestos
log. Rose Darcey slipped down on the
floor, and with her arms folded about
her knees, watched the flre, thinking
how typical it was of the life she had
been leading for the past year. Why,
everything â even her hearth flre â was
artificial.!
She fell to dreaming. It was jselr
dom she had time to dream, for she
was always busy trying to make both
ends meet. But now, since they sim
ply would not meet, she might as well
dream for a tiny space. How tired she
was of it allâ of the struggles, the
petty ambitions, the give-and-take
friendships, the endless cold shoulders,
the eternal worry.

SOME very earnest religious bodies have energetically renewed
the agitation for the introduction of the Bible into the public
schools, while others are insisting- that the Government of the
United States shall force the circulation of the Bible in the Turkish
empire. Is it not possible that these good people misconceive the
purpose of the public schools and the functions of this Government?
The public school is an entirely secular institution. It is sup
ported by taxation of all the people, regardless of their religious
views, the theory of the public school as an American institution
is that the welfareof the secular state depends upon the intelligence
of the people. Therefore the state takes charge of their education
and provides the means of imparting it, for the purely secular
purpose of perpetuating a government that requires general intelli
gence for its own preservation. Is it not true, then, that the state
under our system has nothing to do with the spiritual affairs of the
people, which belong to a kingdom that is not of this world?
If the Bible be used as literature in the schools, it must be sub
ject to the same explanation and interpretation as other literature,
and the state will find itself involved in supplying an official exegesis
of the various proof texts of the scriptures, the varied interpretation
of which has caused the division of Christendom into many sects. It
may well be insisted that such exegesis is not a proper function of
government, yet it would be unavoidable if these zealous people
have their wav. ""
The schools are intended to be secular, to impart secular
knowledge and ethics only, in order to fit people for the secular du
ties required of them by the state. On the other hand, deep religious
purpose and spiritual energy may and do exist, entirely independent
of education and intelligence, and they also exist under the most in
tcllirf-nt and enlightened conditions. Religion then may be without
intelligence, but without intelligence a free, secular state cannot be.
If this view be correct, the state" must confine itself to the imparting
of secular education. If it go beyond that, what shall it do?
The constitution of the United States forbids a religious test or
the recognition of any religious establishment, and it is best to
abide by the broad idea which inspired that constitutional require
ment. If the schools cease to be secular by introducing the Bible,
the spirit of the constitution requires that the Bibles of all the dif
ferent religions that are here shall be used. If only one be intro
duced it will amount to recognition of one religious establishment
to the exclusion of others. These will plead their constitutional right
and there is no doubt that the courts will enforce it.^
Then we must have the rival claims of authority of the King
James and Douay translations of the Bible of Christendom fought
o.ut in the public schools, and against them both will be the whole
field of sacred writings used by the many other forms of religion
which have perfect equality of right under our Government. We
have as citizens of the United States believers in the Koran, in the
philosophy of Confucius, in the Buddhistic scriptures, in the Old
Testament. Under the constitution they are all equal.
Again, if our Government be secular at home what authority
has it to enforce abroad the introduction of any scriptures? Russia
and the Turkish empire have a union of church and state. Here we
have a complete separation of church and state. If those empire^
choose to restrict or forbid the circulation of any scriptures, what
right have we to demand the raising of that embargo? These
schemes are a species of atavism. They are a recurrence of a former
type. They are retrogression to the medieval idea. In the opinion
o'f many faithful believers in Christianity they are injurious to
religion by lifting from the personal conscience that individual re
sponsibility in affairs spiritual which cannot safely be replaced by
anything the state can do.
It is believed that religion stands the test of intelligence and
of ignorance. Its need is felt by both, as a personal need. On the
other hand, the state is neither religious nor irreligious. It is in
capable of any sentiment; it is void of feeling; it is instituted to
attend to the general welfare of the people in secular matters. Their
religious belief and instruction are entirely outside its functions.
Nor is the state a missionary organization, and therefore it has
nothing whatever to do with the religion of other peoples, or the
scriptures which they believe or reject.

Assistant Secretary of the Navy
Charles H. Darling, whose presence on
the Pacific Coast is for the purpose of
Inspecting the Bremerton and Mare Isl
and navy yards, arrived from Mare
Island last night with his wife. Mr.
Darling expects to remain in San Fran
cisco several days, during which he will
be entertained by local bodies and be
afforded an opportunity to Inspect tha
coast defenses and the local shipbuild
ing; yards with a view of seeing for
himself Just how well this port is pre
pared to care for the naval fleets In
time of war. He keeps in olose touch
with the needs of the- Pacific Coast,
and ha stated last night that the de
partment at Washington la very kindly
disposed toward this part of tha coun
try.
"A more valuable man could not have
been selected for the Cabinet," said hÂ«,
"than Paul Morton, who, as Secretary
of the Navy and with his vast amount
of knowledge of affairs on tha Paciflo
Coast and with his forceful. nature, la
bound to keenly appreciate every need
of the navy here and gain for the coast
much more than might be obtained un
der other circumstances."
Continuing Secretary Darling said
that It has become a fixed policy of the
Navy Department to build up big navy
yards on this coast, and that he looked
forward to an expenditure of many
millions In this direction . during the
next few years. The plans folÂ»lmprove
ments call for an expenditure of over
5139,000,000, but only a portion of . this
can be obtained from one Congress, and
it will take a number of years to com
plete all the work now under consid
eration by the department.
Last evening the Secretary was en
tertained at Berkeley by Iota Chapter
of the Zeta Psl fraternity at a banquet
given In the chapter house. Secretary
Darling Is at the head of the Zeta Psi
fraternity In the United States. He will
be entertained at Stanford University
co-day by the chapter there, and to
night he will be a guest at a banquet
at the University Club of this city,
which will be given by the chapter and
the alumni of the University of Cali
fornia. During his stay here he will
be also entertained by the Chamber of
Commerce and be given a luncheon by
the Union League Club. While In this
city the Secretary and his wife will oc

The Sequoia scintillated "scrump
tiously" last night â even rs did the
stars without. Tl.ere was a snap, a
nervous expectancy in the air, just as
though "something was about to hap
pen"âand it didâ to the supreme Joy
of the uncommunicative. And the sur
prise locked deep in the vest pockets
of the directors â of such as have them
â was that the famous young author
of "The Helmet of Navarre," now
Mrs. Bash, and her gallant soldier hus
band were to be guests of honor. *'Twas
Indeed to be a reception, but an Inspi
rational affair of a day's planningâ
and therein lay its joy.
To be sure, there were men who
came In dinner coats and women who
came in street frocks, and these were
visibly and audibly shocked on behold
ing the rest of the assemblage In bril
liant plumage, likewise the honored
guest. But the embarrassment was
but a fragmentary affair as measured
by the o'erflowing bon homme, the
blessedest thing that son of man is
heir to.
Mrs. Bash received the platitudes of
the populace with a charming show
of appreciation, looking very pretty
and very young and very happy In a
diaphanous white frock, bearing. In her
arms a bunch of red roseB. Captain
Bash heroically received at her side,
but these military men are trained to
worse things.
At 11:30 the guests â about forty of
them â adjourned to the cafe; where a
merry little supper was spread and
some rather clever toasts were ven
tilated. Original? Why need they be,
when every guest holds a copy of
Prosit?
those gathered in the red
room were Captain and " Mrs. Bash,
Miss Mary Bell, Miss Ednah Robinson,
Charles Sedgwick Alken, Colonel and
Mrs. Coolidge, Mrs. Elizabeth Gerberd
lng. Miss Grace Llewellyn Jones, Mr.
and Mrs. William H. Mills, Dr. Arnold

That little supper was something of
an Innovation. So, too, was the sur
prise in the matter of the 'lions"; like
wise in the diversity of attire â which
was distinctly something of a comedy,
as a result of said surprise.

j training. Her voice Is of excellent qual
i ity. sweet, warm and full; weak, how
' ever, in its lower notes and not of great
| range. It is placed a little too far back,
i Borne throatiness resulting, but, on the
; whole, is distinctly pleasing. The same
J may be said of her singing. Miss
Kisielnicka is entirely sincere and no
tably earnest in her work, has repose,
poise and ease. Character and variety
are lacking, however, and in such arias
as the Salnt-Saens "Samson and Deli
! lah" the dramatic quality was notably
| among those missing. Perhaos the
' singer was at her best in the charming
j little "Das Blumenhaus," by E. Hll
; dach. and the Schubert "Who Is Syl
i via?" both of which were effectively
j turned. Miss von Kislelnicka's pro
gramme contained also the following
; numbers, in which she was well accom
! panled by Mrs. Alice Bacon Washing
â¢ ton: "Das Veilchen" (Mozart). "Lotus
! blume" (Schumann), "Feldeinsamkelt"
j (Brahms). "Caro mio ben" (Glordanl).
j "Die Stelle am Fliederbaum" (Drae
| seke), "Abendstern" ("Wagner), "Helm
; wen" (Hugo Wolf). "Elegie" (Masse
! net) and "Viatique" (Chamlnade). In re
' sponse to a hearty encore to the "Satn
! son and Delilah" aria Miss von Klslel
| nicka gave "Still as the Night."
Assisting her were Miss Hulda An
j derson. pianist, who gave a pretty and
j graceful, withal somewhat butterfly ren
| derlng of the Scarlatti "Caprtccio" and
} "Pastorale," and a Leschltlzky "Ma-
I rourka," and as encore an effective llt
! tie left-hand study, and Hother Wls
! mer. violinist. In a thoughtful reading
i of the allegro from Spohr*s G minor
concerto and the Sinding suite (op. 10).

Seattle Plays Remarkable Game at
Bat and in the Field.
ANGLES ARE BADLY BEATEN*.
Lowell Boxer Says 31c Can Do 133
rounds as Required by Britt.
It now appears that matchmaker
Jim Coffroth of the Yosemite . Club
has succeeded in landing Jimmy Britt
and Billy Gardner for the December
date of . the club. Coffroth received
word from Gardner last night that lie
would do 133 pounds at 6 o'clock for
Britt and now all that is needed is
Britt's consent to the match.
Britt will probably do business with
the Lowell lad, now that the latter
has decided to make such a ! low
weight. Coffroth was not successful
in his quest for Britt last night and
therefore was unable to straighten out
the match. Coffroth and Britt will
probably have a conference to-day
and the match is likely to be made
without further ceremony. If details
are arranged Gardner will come im
mediately to this city and prepare for
the battle.
Coffroth also had a heart to heart
talk with Teddy Murphy, manager of
Battling Nelson. Murphy agrees to
meet Britt at 132 pounds at 6 o'clock
If he Is successful in getting rid of
Corbett. If the Gardner match falls
through there is still a possibility of
securing either Corbett or Nelson to
meet the native son.
GARDNER WILL MAKE WEIGHT.
Battling Nelson is anxiously await
ing the tap of the gong for his coming
battle with Young Corbett. He has
been in active training for two weeks
and is in excellent condition. This does
not keei) him from hard work. He
realizes that the battle is the one of his
career and he intends to work hard up
to the day of the fight. He was on the
roads of Marin for sixteen miles yes
terday and returned looking as fresh as
a daisy. In the afternoon he spent more
than an hour in the gymnasium punch-
The little boxer and his trainer, Har
ry, Tuthill, state positively that the
weight will be all right and that Cor
bett willbe ready to stow the Battler
away when he gets started. Corbett,
ha3 all his old-time strength and hit
ting power if he can reduce naturally
and not have to resort to the baths the
day of the fight.
Young Corbett Is still plugging dili
gently along at his training quarters at
the ocean beach in an effort to take oft"
the few extra pounds of weight with
which he is burdened. It was given out
at his camp yesterday that the former
champion weighed about 135. pounds.
He still has six days to take off five
pounds, so that he will have to get rid
of a little less than a pound each day
if he will accept that as his allotted
task.. He is devoting himself to road
work almost entirely. Yesterday he
went out on the highway and ran and
walked till the perspiration fairly
poured off him. After a brisk rubdown
and. a rest he entered the gymnasium
for a little work. He took on Billy Otts
and the pair went several hurricane
rounds. He then toyed with the weight
and wrist machines till he satisfied
himself that a day's work had been
done.
ing the bag, wrestling, throwing the
medicine ball and pulling the weights.
He concluded his work for the day by
boxing a couple of rounds each with
Frank Rafael and Stockings Kelly, an
amateur Chicago welter-weight. Eddie
Santry, who is billed to fight Jack Cor
dell, is working with Nelson and seems
in fine condition.

Visions of the fluttering pennant as
it waves in the breeze began to grow
dim in the eyes of Peter Lohman yes
terday afternoon at Oakland, when
Charles Irwin spiked the rubber in
the. sixth inning. Nor were Peter's
spirits cheered in the least during the
rounds that followed, for that run
which the Seals' leader scored was a
precious one and the lone point for
the day. The game was called at the
middle of the eighth on account of
darkness.
Joe Corbett was the cause of the
downfall of the Commuters and his
masterly box work may prove their
undoing in the run for the flag. Cor
bett was at his best yesterday if ever
he was in his life. Every Commuter,
with the exception of the sprightly
Mr. Francks, was at his mercy
i throughout the struggle. Errors gave
the Commuters a couple of chances,
but the hit was lacking.
Schmidt displayed a little bad Judg
ment in the sixth, when the fatal run
scored. Irwin opened up the round
with a two-bagger against the center
field fence, and Van Buren laid down
a bunt. Schmidt had oceans of time
to catch Irwin at third, but he over
looked his chance and threw the ball
to first. Then Waldron popped out a
fly to Kruger, which the latter drop
ped and the game was won.
Schlafley's interference cost the
Commuters a run in the fourth.
Francks had singled and had been
forced at second by Dunleavy, who
stole second. Schlafley was up and he
sent a slow one to Van Buren. Van
ran for the bag with the ball and
Schlafley gave him the shoulder and
then grabbed him. In the meantime
Dunleavy scored from second, but the
umpire made him go back.
â¢ In the fifth the Commuters had a
full house and only one man gone, but
still they could not coax a run
through. Kruger was safe on Goch
nauer's fumble and Devereaux hit a
slow one to first. Van" Buren threw :
the ball away over Corbett's head and
Corbett walked Stark. Schmidt bunt
ed out to Van and Ganley struck out,
so the royal chance was tossed away.
There was ginger and excitement
galore in the battle, with every fielder
playing his best and pulling off bril
liant plays. Corbett worked slowly
and thus delayed the game so long
that it was impossible to play the nine
innings. The score:
San Francisco â i Oakland

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
Hildebrand was first with Smithy
Kane, finished unplaced on Revolt,
second astride Hindoo Princess and
landed in the show on El Piloto.
"Chub" Russell and Willie Holmes;
two California jockeys who have been
riding. on the tracks of Austria and
France for three or four seasons, were
at the track yesterday. Both will be
seen In the saddle shortly/r" ! '<;:
Advices received from Latonia state
that the stables of "Kansas" Price and
Henry Bundy left that point for Oak
land last Sunday. Price will bring
reven and Bundy the useful perform
ers. The Goldflnder. Beautiful and
Eest and Best Man.
Ripper, winner of the fourth race,
was bid up from $400 '-> $300 by Jack
Brannon. . B. Flaherty retained his
gelding with the customary $5.
From all accounts riding talent is
somewhat scarce at Los Angeles. SCIll
this is to be expected from the in
creased number of winter meetings.
Tony Barrett departed for Los An
geles last night. He likes the game at
Oakland~and will return shortly.
Cerro Santa was always supposed to
be a front runner, but Knapp brought
the Eprinter from the rear.
R Sullivan, the Bianchi & McGov
ern stable rider, piloted two winners.
L. D. Hall, who trains Smithy Kane,
was out here last season as the trainer
of Don Domo. Burnie Bunton and Bay
"Wonder.
Johnny Schorr paid but $75 for
Golden Buck.
Hildebrand left for Los Angeles last
evening, as he is carded to appear at
the southern meeting to-morrow, the
opening day. Hildy would much prefer
to ride at Oakland, but Joe Yeager, to
â¢whom he is under contract for the win
ter, will do most of his racing in the
southland.
' TRACK NOTES.
If Romaine, favorite for the second
seven-furlonp run, had not been "Haw
kins' hoss" he would not have gath
ered anything. Helgesen was slow in
Retting away from the post, and
trampled around the field. In the
t-tretch the first choice wore down the
lead of fc-ol Liechtenstein by degrees,
v inning, ridden out, by a length. Hil
debrand was third with El Piloto.
Because W. Davis had the mount on
Orafter in the final mile and seventy
yard recital the smart set imagined
it saw something. So when some
Oraftor money came to the surface the
i ilds against Mike Daly's Elliott
lengthened out from 3 to 5 to 3 to 2.
Little Ilsyes. astride Tannhauser, was
indulged v.jth the lead to the bend for
the wire; then Dominick moved for
the front with Elliott and it was no
race at all, for he disposed of Tele
phone at leisure. The show went to
Grafter."
Hildebrand rode Hindoo Princess in
the mile selling affair, and this fact
more than anything else caused the
mare to be installed favorite. Hilde
brand kept her out in front as long as
hÂ«- could, when Ripper ran over the
faint-hearted daughter of Amigo in
the run home, scoring with little or no
effort. Silurian at last stirred up
some speed, nosing out Estado for the
Ehow. Sixteen to five was the closing
quotation about the winner.
HIPPER AX EASY WINNER.
A big field of fifteen started in the
two-year-old event, with Smithy Kane
the medium of a well-directed plunge.
Hildebrand had the mount and from
4 the odds gradually fell to 9 to 6.
â¢"Hildy" got Smith away sailing and it
was Just a promenade for the Texas
bred youngster. Phalanx ran with
marked gameness, easily getting the
place from Golden Buck. Squire John
ron, away poorly, ran fourth.
From the way the money passed into
the books in coarse chuncks on Bob
Smith's filly Ponapa to win the five
and a half furlong sprint, third on the
menu, it looked as if the harvest days
had come again. Kansas City "dope"
and a well circulated tip sent her price
down from fours to 8 to 5 and even
lower. At one stage of it she was
third.- but failed to stand the rub.
finishing back in the ruck. After H.
L. Frank had forced the pacemaker.
Redan, to strike his colors, he was in
turn challenged and led over the line
a neck by the 7 to 1 shot. Cerro San
ta, piloted by "Big Bill* Knapp.
Sullivan succeeded in getting away
from the barrier well with Flaneur,
taking the lead on the back stretch.
The favorite made a strong bid for it
in the stretch and Flaneur only won
by a head. W. Davis landed the 20 to
1 shot Penzance third.
The onward tread of favorites in the
betting: at Oakland track is as diffi
cult to check as was the march of
Coxey's army on "Washington. Had It
not been for the downfall of Melster
slnger, Ponapa and Hindoo Princess,
the three choices to hit the toboggan
yesterday, several layers would have
been compelled to purchase hand or
gans and try their hand at grinding out
money at a new vocation.
Flaneur started the ball in motion
and the cakewalk performed by
Stnithy Kane, with 'Gen? Hildebrand
on his back, made no hit with the
pencilers. Of couse. Ripper and Cerro
Santa afforded a breathing spell, but
their victories were followed by the
\\:ns of Romaine and Elliott, two more
Fhort-prieed ones. Just now the talent
is investing heavily in birds and pints,
but it is a long lane that has no turn.
After disa-ppoiuting on a couple of
occasions Blanch! & McGovern's
brown gelding. Flaneur, finally came
through in the seven-furlong selling
number, which opened the day's sport.
He opened favorite over Meistersinger.
but such a bunch of coin was -unloaded
on the Henshall entry that the latter
enjoyed a slight call in the ring.

wrote to the hotel at Eureka asking
if Spencer was there. He received a
telegram that no one of that name had

The West Coast Rubber Company haa
gone to the wall, and in its voluntary
petition in bankruptcy, filed yesterday
in the Superior Court, It is stated that
the failure is due to the bad. arid un
skillful management of its former pres
lderit.George Fredricks. Judge Kerrigan
granted the petition and ordered the
creditors to appear in Judge Troutt'a de
partment on December 1 to prove their
debts and choose an assignee.
The petition is signed by President
J. H. Bennett in accordance with the
action of the board of directors taken
on November 16.
According to Benbow he will make
another flight to-morrow, as the dam
age in the gasoline tank can be re
paired in a few minutes.
The airship was navigated by the in
ventor, who said after the flight that
he considered it very succegful in the
light of the accident that occurred to
his machinery. A leak in the gasoline
tank allowed all the fluid "to escape and
rendered his motor useless shortly after
he had started the flight. Benbow also
was handicapped by having too much
gas in his balloon, and it was necessary
for him Jo allow some of the hydrogen
to escape during the flight. For that
reason he did not start the motor until
he had drifted with the wind for nearly
a mile.
During the brief time that the motor
was working the airship made headway
against the wind and answered its rud
der perfectly. Shortly after Benbow
started his motor he found that the
gasoline had become exhausted, and
allowed the Meteor to drift with" the
wind until he found a landing place.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 22.â After remaining
in the air forty-five minutes, only for
a brief period of which it was propelled
by its own power, the Montana Meteor,
the airship deslgmed and constructed by
Thomas Benbow of Columbus, Mont.,
was brought safely to the gTOund in an
open field, three miles southeast of the
aerodrome.

The whaling schooner Charles Han- '
ton. Captain McKenna, arrived yester
day, twenty-four days from Unalaska,
with 2200 pounds of bone stowed in her
hold. The Hanson got only one whale.
Hhe narrowly escaped destruction in the
ice off Point Barrow. She was caught
in the ice pack September 3 and was
squeezed until every limber creaked.
The pressure did not cease until all
hands had come to the conclusion that
in the fate of Humpty Dumpty and
that of the Charles Hanson the only
difference would be in the means by
which the end was rehched. The
schooner managed to break out, how
ever, before her hull collapsed alto
gether. Her stem was carried away,
her planking damaged and when she
got free from the ice it was found that
she was leaJting badly. The dent was
temporarily patched and repairs were
effected later at Dutoh Harbor.
She encountered heavy weather or.
the homeward run, and November 8 off
Cape Flattery her jib boom was carried
away during a stiff southeaster.
Joseph Xewmpyer. who left here on
the codf.shing schooner Stanley, came
heme on the Charles Hanson. New
meyer and a shipmate left the Stanley
in "a fishing dory. A s-torm came up.
and when the weather quieted the
schooner was not in Fight. The two
cedfishers spent four days in the dory- '
They were without food or water, and
the inclement weather thtn prevailing
added to their sufferings. They man
aged to reach Dutch Harbor, where

"SAMPLES ONLY" â The following are but
I j I' a few. sample cases out of the MULTITUDE
successfully treated last week:
""CRIPPLE LEAPS"â Inflammatory rheuma-
tism stiffened my spine and limbs, could
barely CREEP along; last Tuesday Rexradlo
straightened me out and limbered me up;
raised limbs naturally, RAN and LEAPED.
Many similar cases.
"LIFE SAVED" â "At the 'crisis' of danger-
ous disease he saved my life."
"DEATH AVERTED" â "Rexradio speedily,
thoroughly cured me of dreadful malady,
which slowly but surely leads to certain
. death."
"SCIATICA'S DEMON FANGS exquisitely
tortured me; Rexradio's power speedily slew
this GILA MONSTER and I entered a
PAINLESS PARADISE."
"IT STAYS" â "Rexradlo cured my GASTRI-
TIS in July; I stay cured."
"THE FIERY of Typhoid Fever
was consuming me; Rexradlo quickly quench-
ed It and delivered me."
"COULDN'T STOOP through Lumbago; quick-
ly, painlessly stooped and touched floor with
hands last week." (Numerous others.)
"NO RETURN TICKET" â "My cancer left
many weeks ago and having no return ticket
it remains away." Â¦
"PILLORIED FOR YEARS" by deforming
"articular" rheumatism. Joints solid and
"Immovable," helpless, entirely waited on
by others, lifted from and into bed, racked
with severest pains all over, groaning with
agony if even lightly touched, lying In bed
like a statue of marble, Mrs. Knowles, 379
-Bartlett, by Rexradio's ONE treatment was
Instantly able to freely, naturally, move
each loosened Joint, rose unaided from bed,
and seated herself in a chair; first time In
years; her excruciating pains ceased and be-
ing at her request vigorously slapped 6he
declared the blows produced no pain; her
cheery welcome awaits "visitors"; she will
grasp and shake your hand with the hands
eo long solid and unable to close. SEE
HER.
"FIRMLY LOCKED JOINTS," due to AN-
CHYLOSIS, in several cases recently have
been UNLOCKED and set at liberty by the
MASTER KEY of Rexradlo'a "humanized
Radium." (Proofs.)
DISLOCATED VERTEBRA."â One of the
spine bones thrown out of place, protruded
outwardly, producing PARALYSIS; Rex-
radio's wonderful power replaced It, also re-
moved the paralysis so I could run and
LEAP; see me." A precisely similar case
had a like benefit a week since.
"IN ITS TOILS"â Acutely painful RHEUM-
ATI.SM had me In its tolls; couldn't stoop,
raise feet, scarcely walk; Rexradlo touched
ine twice and. stooping, I touched the floor
with my hands, ra'sed feet high. RAN and
LEAPED freely, painlessly; pains all gone
and smart slapping did not hurt, where the
loast touch had produced agony before."
"MUSIC IN HIS HEAD"â Totally deaf,~pa"-
tlcnt complained of hissing, crackling, roar-
ing and MUSICAL sounds In his head; after
' (onÂ») treatment he heard a WHISPER and
said "All those noises have ceased and even
my MUSICAL BOX has RUN DOWN." 1
''FAR REACHING" treatment â Numerous pa- i
tlents have been successfully treated for I
various diseases, hundreds of miles away
. without seeing Rexradlo.
"SEVERALTpHYSIciANS" testify they SAW
Rexradlo treat alleged "incurable" diseases
with amazing success. (Names at offices.)
"LIKE MAGIC" â I saw the large CANCER
before R.'s (single) treatment: after, it was
. lost "to sight and touch. It was like magic.
"DANGER POIN?"' â Rexradio's (one) treat- I
ment at once removed my bedridden friend's
. agonies when her acute disease had reached
the "alarmlnc" danger point; next day she
rose WELL. '
"PERMANENT RESULTS"â One treatment
may and often does secure surprising re-'
suits, the possible permanence of which de-
pends en a limited number of further daily 1
treatments.
"PUBLICITY" Is objected to by the above pa-
tlents. hence their "names" are not heie
published, but persons similarly afflicted will
. find them at the offices.
'â¢$1000 FORFEIT" if cases above reported are
not absolutely "genuine."

"dlum healer. Office hours 2 to 7. Free lec-
ture and "public" healing TO-DAY. 2 and 8

Though Mr. McKinlay has given the
reclamation question much study, he
has gone to work on the problem with
renewed energy and is busy compiling
statistics and gathering facts for pres
entation to the Rivers and Harbors
Committee when he appears before It.
Congressmen-elect Kahn and Hayes
will also be active in this preliminary
work with the result that when tha
question reaches the stage where a bill
must be drafted for presentation to tha
Senate and the House there will be no
delay through lack of thorough under
standing of the problem to be solved.
And the question of the reclamation
of these lands will also be taken up
at the coming session of the State
Legislature, though in all probability
the Federal Government will do the
major portion of this work- California
must also aid. especially in the matter
â¢f appropriation. The plans of the
board of engineers employed to solve
the reclamation problem will be In the
hands of the Reclamation Association
by the time the Legislature meets, and
it is the desire of the association to
secure at this session an appropriation
of sufficient funds to at least start the
gigantic work of confining the flood
waters of the Sacramento and the San
Joaquin.
t Another consultation of Congressmen
and Congressmen-elect has been held
regarding what action shall be taken
to obtain an appropriation by the Gov
ernment to carry out the plans de
vised by the Board of Engineers for tha
reclamation of the inundated lands ot
the Sacramento and San Joaauin ba
sins. As a result the entire Congres
sional delegation has decided to take
up the Important work at the coming
session of Congress and not wait, as
was originally proposed, until the Con
gressmen-elect take office in March
next.
However, arrangements will be mada
whereby the Congressmen-elect will
take an active hand In the work to be
done in the December session. Con
gressman James McLachlan of the
Seventh District has requested Con
gressman-elect Duncan E. McKinlay of
the Second District to attend the De
cember session of CongVess and appear
before the House Committee on Rivera
and Harbors and present his views on
the reclamation problem.

and prices declined sharply. In the afternoon
fancy stock was belnjr offered freely at 23Â©24c
rer pound, but moved rather slowly, as buyer*
were still holding off in expectation of further
declines. The three cars of Oregon stock that
were received on Monday and were held at
27c per pound were thrown on the market and
were being pressed for sale at 23-g25c. Re
tailers were complaining of the light consump
tive demand, which they claim was due
largely to the fact that high prices had been
generally predicted and caused a great many
people to decide to go without Turkey for
Thanksgiving day. Live Poultry was gener
ally quiet, with prices largely nominal.

1 There was enormous absorption both Â¦ of
1 United States Steel preferred and of the sink
i inz fund bonds and the operations were at
j tribu-.ed in large degree to the operations of a
I lool. Colorado Fuel was <he only one of the
I independent steel stocks to show marked sym
j pathy. The movement In Brooklyn Transit
I and Manhattan was paralleled by that i.i In
teiborcugh Transit on the curb. On the other
I hand, the persistent heaviness of the Pacifies
{ on the Stock. Exchange Â¦ had its counterpart in
) the declirrc of Northern Securities on the curb.
J The motive seemed to be a disappointment
] over the further postponement in the Northern
I Securities case, bu,t these scattering points of
I weakness were envclcred in the later decline
I which overcame thÂ» whole market and wiped oat
j the gains in the few strong points. The spe
cial cause of the flurry in the /motjey
j was said to be the placing of over" $10,000,000
j r 'f Pennsylvania Car Trust bonds. But many
j larzer transactions than that have been con
, ducted in the money market i in. the last few
we<-lts without disturbance. It was perceived
this morning that scree of the largest â¢ recent.
j lenders of money were not In the market, and
i those who delayed filling their requirements
! ur.til late bid up the rate to the 4 per cent
I level. But there were no further engagements
I of gold for export, although the foreign ex
| rhang-e market continued firm. Last- prices
' were enly slightly above the lowest and th*
i cicsinc tone was weak, at losses generally of
I between 1 and 2 points.

SUMMARY OF' T1IE MARKETS.

the suspicion that the market was being sup
ported for the purpose of realizing. The exist
ence cf this suspicion made the market, vul
nerable ind when the rate for call loans flur
ried to 4 per cent in the afternoon stocks came
out freely from all Quarters of the room and
prices broke rather precipitately. Some of the
features of strength had nominal explanations
fcr their advance, but the subsequent market
caused the impression that the advance had
been manipulated for purposes of sustaining
the market.

fleet in port has a registered tonnage of _i.

WHEATâ The foreign markets were quiet
and not materially changed. Chicago was tfc,c
higher on the day. Tha Chicago letter of E.
F. Hutton & Co. said: .
"Our market opened strong and sharply
higher under the influence of higher cables,
reflecting uneasiness on the other aide, pre
sumably over the Argentine harvest situation.
This coupled with the extremely short inter
est in the market carried over night, caused
a wild opening, after which the market did
but very little. The action of the market to
day shows how acutely the Argentine situation
can affect our market. Any serious damage
to that crop would cause a change In the en
.tire world's markets and give ours a bullish
impetus. Cash markets continue to report a
slow and disappointing demand and our ex
ports for Flour are absolutely nothing. V>*
continue to feel that the market is a profes
sional scalping affair and will be Influenced
largely aside from foreign news, by the po
sition- of the pit traders. Sentiment to-night
is very much mixed."
This "market- was quiet at thÂ« decile* of
Monday, with futures, however, firmer. There
is no new feature to report. Offerings arÂ«
sufficient for the demand.

There is no further decline in Cheese, but

demand to absorb.
strength abroad was said to be a result of j
active buying- caused by reports from ArgÂ«n- I
tina claiming that heavy rains had Â¦ delayed |
harvesting In that country. . From' the start j
shorts were eager ! bidders for wheat, but of
ferings at first were limited. A little later
there was some selling as a result of liberal
receipt3 in the Northwest. There was also con
siderable profit taking, which finally resulted
hi a sJfght reaction. At $1 08% for December,
however, shorts again became active- buyers
and prices started on another upward move
ment. Throughout the remainder of the day
the tendency was toward a higher level. A
number of reports, were received from the
Southwest stating that rain is - greatly
needed and that much damage is 1 being done
by drought. Another bullish consideration wa3
a decrease in primary receipts. Strength of
cash wheat at Kansas City was also a factor.

IXJtTRED IX COLLISION.â Georgs Blaad>
ard and H. J. Kelly, two contractor*, werat
struck by a Sacramento street car at 'ths
corner of Spruce street last night while driving
Jn a buggy. Both escaped with a few slight
wounds of the head and scalp.
Judge Sloss devoted the entire day
yesterday to a partial hearing of the
suit of John E. Quinn, in role of tax
payer, for an Injunction to prevent
Auditor Baehr from auditing and
Treasurer MacDougald from paying
the salaries of the employes of the
Board of Health who were appointed
on January 9 last. For the plaintiff
â¢Vttorneys Charles "W. Slack, Franklin
K. Lane and J. A. Wright appeared.
Abe Ruef represented the Health
Board and Assistant City Attorney
Partridge looked after the case of the
defendants. On the date mentioned
the Board of Health abolished the of
fice of secretary and those of sanitary
inspectors, and the incumbents went
out with the offices. The office of
Deputy Health Officer was created, .to
which L.ouls Levy was appointed, and
the, positions of Inspecting physicians
were filled with four doctors.
The plaintiff contends that the board
did not act In good faith, but conspired
to do thr several employes out of their
Jobs, and that the new employes are
not regularly appointed. The position
of the defense is that the board, in the
interest of economy, desired to com
bine the duties of several attaches un
der one office, hence the changes. Mr.
Ruef cited back to the Phelan admin
istration in 1500 to show that even then
the Civil Service Commission had call
ed the Mayor's attention to the fact
that tfie Health Office was employing
superfluous and expensive attaches,
and that the change, when instituted,
effected a saving of $10,000 to the city.
l,ouis Levy was on the stand all
morning and explained his own duties
and those of the other . employes. He
said he had not drawn his pay. but
had met expenses by borrowing money
which he meant to return. Mr. Ruef
jokingly asked that this go Into the
record, and it developed that Levy had
been borrowing from him.
Secretary Edward F. AJoran of the
Civil Service Commission testified as
to the actions of the commission In
approving and disapproving Health
Board appointments and as to the sug
gestion in 1900 that the staff employed
was too large.
The hearing will be resumed on next
Tuesday.
Coroner Leland held an inquest yes
terday upon the body of Patrick Mlne
han, who died November 8 of injuries
received by being struck by an elec
tric car at the crossing of Fourth and
Freelon streets. The jury returned a
verdict to the effect that death was ac
cidental and that the Jury was unable
to fix the responsibility.

But though we feel very Intensely upon this
subject, we still bear no ill will to an or

conception for any one to believe that. It is
a misstatement for any one -to express it. We
have nothing but the kindliest feelings for thÂ«
Western Federation of Miners. We have tried

has a right to expect, that the international

of the American Federation of Labor.
We try to impress upon any unafflllated In

dominate it. We have no deÂ«ire to Interfere
with its Internal affairs. Our main object Is
to try to federate the united workmen for the
promotion and advancement, particularly the
protection of their Interests, and to spread the
feeling of fraternity and the spirit of solidar
ity â where one man sees his own best interests
best served by trying to serve his fellow
men.

A daily journal of the proceedings of
the convention of the American Feder
ation of Labor is published and circu
lated in the convention hall. In this
are resolutions that were reported to
committees, the resolutions now num
bering something like 200. They are in
small type, and so.it is possible to get
a number of resolutions on one page.
The Socialists have been prolific in res
olutions and they are sown broadcast
through the pages of the convention's
Journal, and- look where one will ; at
least one resolutionâ as prolific in trou
ble as dragon's teeth to those opposed
to Socialismâ is found t on each and
every page. - --
Two such were the first to be consid
ered yesterday, both of which were in
troduced by Victor L.. Berger.
DISCUSS THE MILITIA.
The first of these resolutions recom
mended that .worklngmen shall not join
the militia, Berger said that "as long
as the capitalist can hire, one part of
the working people to shoot down an
other part they are safe In the posses
sion of this country.". Berger said that
he preferred the system of Switzerland,
"where there is no militia, except that
every able-bodied man In Switzerland
belongs to the fighting force and has a
gun to keep at home." He said:
In America things are different Most of.
the men In America do not know how to use
weapons, and the militia are not afraid of the
men shooting back. In Switzerland the work
ing, people were in a position to shoot back.
In Switzerland they settled the strike by buy-
Ing up the railroads and granting the .. de
mands of organized labor. -
Now, I ddn't say .that the Bwlsa system Is
exactly the proper system, but I say that if
the Socialists would get control of the State
of Wisconsin, then instead of having four
regiments of militia made up of dudes and
bank clerks, and some organized workers,
some trade* union men who think that they- are
better than the other* because they earn
fifty cents more a day â instead of being made
up of people - of that kind, people who are
not of our class and people who can be hired, j
we would have four hundred regiments ln
etcad of lour In Wisconsin, and probably 1000
regiments In the State of New York, prob
ably 8C0 regiments in the State of Pennsyl
vania, and 320 In the State of Massachusetts.
In such a case I would be in favor of the
militia. In other words, if the ; militia were
what the United States constitution Intended
it to be. -then I would , be In favor of the
militia.
Delegate Zaring said:
I think that organized labor In America
ought to take some stand that our members
should not belong to the militia. I contend
that the very existence of the militia makes
the militia neceseary. and that if there was no
such thing as the militia then the large em
ploying classes, who are so ready to. oppress
the working men, would be more ready to
grant fair conditions to â¢ the working men.
And I think there ought to be some resolution
drawn up which would indicate the disapproval
of this convention to members of organized
labor belonging to the militia.
Delegate Brown,- one of the Social
istic delegates, said:
When a man In this convention has received
a brand from the bayonet of the United
States soldier he does not feel friendly to the
militia. I believe that If most' of us had
been through a similar experience that we
would also be In favor of the adostlon of a
resolution. When you recall . the fact of the
State - militia of Colorado being used as. a
positive weapon in the hands of the Citizens'
Alliance against organized labor, I think it is
about time tbat we put ourselves on record
as being opposed to such a use of the Judicial
power*. ' ..
Delegate, Guerin said: that members
of the federation " should ' bo \ urged to
Join the State. Militia -. . ;.

purpose is to diminish the business

Treasurer Lennon of the federation
said in part:
CITES CONSTITUTION.
Tou are cited to the fact that the constitu
tion of the United States contains a clause
as to the right of the citizens to bear arms,
which shall not be abridged. Does this con
vention desire to go on record as being op
posed to that fundamental declaration of the
constitution, which we recognize as being an
absolute necessity for the maintenance of a
free government on the face of the earth?
It is true that the use of the militia is abused.
Why were not the resolutions drawn along
those lines, .where perhaps all might coincide?
Go broadcast about this country as you will
and what do you find? We find the young
men of all our crafts. In a small number at
least, in the militia. Why are they there?
Because of their social environments; because
of the fact again that the physical training
that 1* acquired In the, militia Is In a sense
beneficial. , The use of the militia as It is
used is the thing to complain of, not' the
fact that there Is a militia, not the fact
that the Government of the United States and
of the various States has organized a militia
for the preservation of peace.
.T)o we desire to take a stand that law and
orc*er are not to be maintained In our respect
ive States? I do not propose to take any such
Btand. I have been in the trades union move
ment in Colorado in hotter times than have
recently existed in that State and I never
cam e in contact with the militia, although
they were called out and were stationed along
the Rio Grande ' Railroad from one end of It
to the other.
We conducted a strike there as well as It
could be conducted under the then existing cir
cumstances and yet without contact with the
militia. I realize full well how often and
how grievously the militia has been misused,
but I am not prepared to vote against the
declaration in the constitution of the United
States in favor of abridging 'the right of the
citizens to bear arms and have arms in their
homes if they so desire.
FOSTER USES SARCASM.
Frank K. Foster, secretary of the
resolutions committee, contributed to
the discussion. His remarks were in
part as follows:
But I want to say to my good Â¦Â¦ friend, the
delegate from I the Tailors' Union, that I am
surprised at his optimistic frame of mind In
thinking that a little matter like the consti
tution of the United. States would stand be
tween the vagaries of *ome of our friends and
dlscusÂ«lon in this body. The constitution of
the United States. â¢ viewed â¢ under -certain col
ored lights, -Is merely a capitalistic institution,
and as such should be treated to the same
course of medicine that the trades union move
â¢rr.ent would be treated to^-lt should be punc
tured, lacerated, stabbed 'and otherwise mal
treated.. ? ' ;
But the constitution of the United States Is
still here. Perhaps if we should pass a num
ber of resolutions it would' continue to exist
for a few years to come. The peculiar feature
in all of these discussions which are lugged by
. the heels into this arena Is that the. universal
course of the lozic Is to reason from the ex
ception and not from the rule; to,. condemn be
cause of the occasional abuse the entire insti
tution, I do not know of any Institution here
or elsewhere In tbe world that Is not suscep
tible of abuse.
Governors become tyrannical. Because there
is a Governor Peabody, will you say that there
shall be no chief executive of a ' common
wealth? Precisely the same logic holds good
in that aspect as to the Institution of the mi
litia. It seems to me that from the mere out
side effect of this resolution we cannot afford
to place ourselves In a position where the
members of antagonistic organizations can
point the finger at this convention and say,
"We told you so. These men acknowledge no
law but the law of their own unbridled de
sire. They want to do away with our militia
so that they can conduct themselves as they
please.'* â¢ \
. But the real reason above alt that this reso
lution should not pass Ms this: thajt no trades
union, this body or any other, has a right to
interfere in the private Judgment of a man as
to his relations with the. State. My own In
ternational union has gone on record as op
posed to the proposition' contained in the res
olution. 'I have no love or admiration. for the
military army, and never, have affiliated with
the militia, but I believe that every member
of my organization, or of your organization. If
he wants to bo j affiliated, has the absolute
right to enroll himself in the militia.
SOCIALISTS ARE BEATEN.
The report of the* committee was
adopted and the resolution was turned
down \after a deal more of talk. A
similar fate befell the second of Ber
ger's Socialistic resolutions to be taken
up, the second one , providing for a ;
pension for aged working people.
To the support of this resolution the
Socialists rallied in force, and speeches
in- Its favor, were made by Barnes of
New York ajid Ramsey, who is a law-'
yer. It was opposed by Vice President
Duncan, Delegate Devine Â¦â¢ Jid Secre- \
-tary Foster.
The secretary again grew sarcastic
and recalling the use of the name of
President Eliot of Harvard on ihe pre
ceding day, said : . Â¦
I want to call the attention of a warlike
delegate from -the city of brotherly love that
on the 7th day of February of this year thÂ«
president of Harvard University, speaking in
Faneuil Hall, advanced as one of the lemediea
for the ills afflicting the wage earning class
the granting of an old age pension to working
people. I have seen many < wondrous things ! In
the brief space of existence 1 have been privi
leged to enjoy, but' I nover. conceived that the
hour would arrive when the delegate from thÂ«
'Cls-armakers'' Union and President Eliot would
be one mind with a single thought, two hearts

As Is well known by most of the delegates
to the American Federation of Labor my or
ganization, the Western Federation of Miners,
ie not affiliated with the American Federation
cf Labor. I want to fay to you that as a.
member of the executive board of the Western
Federation for the laEt two years It ha* been
cne of my pleasures to further as far as pos
Â«ible an affiliation with this body. This fact
Is known by delegates in this convention. I
believe that there is room in this great coun
try Â£or only one great federation of labor. Be.
llevlng that, it then follows that it is my
duty, and the duty, I believe, of every other
member of whatsoever organization hÂ« may be
long to, to use h!Â« efforts In that direction.
I believe that under the present systematized
procedure of organized- capital It Is neceseary,
that the time has arrived In this country when
It is absolutely necessary for all organizations
or all union men to be under but one head,
to etand solidly together and to proceed as one
body. Therefore, as I eay, I have used my ln
f.neuce as a member of the executive board of
the Western Federation of Miner* In that di
rection. I hope that the time Is not far dte
tant when the union men of this great country
will all be under the same tent, so to speak
Now, brothers. I do not wish to take up any
tnore of your time; I do not think It wise
Tou have your business to attend to. I am
thankful, as I said, for tbe opportunity to ad-
Crees you. for the courteay of thÂ« floor and
I hop* that the deliberation* of this convention
will be *uch that will bring about changes
the necessary beneficial changes to all organ

I do not believe it wise or necessary to take
up your time with an extended statement or
detail of the conditions In Colorado, as they
have been !n the last year and a half, as I
know that this convention has much buelnei-6
to atu-nd to and does not care to be bothered
â¢R-Hh that sort of thing, and most of you are
somewhat, if not well posted, upon the condi
tions that have prevailed.
I wi:i say only that at this time In Colorado
the ccir.ple-xion cf thing* ha* changed *ome
m hat. As a result of organization and effort
our esteemed Governor Peabody ha* been rel
egated to the rear. We hope that the Incoming'
Incumbent, who hac twice been Governor of
Colorado, -will give ve a fair and just admin
istration. That Is all that organized labor
asks for. In Colorado as els#where. I am In
your city to explain thoroughly and In detail
the condition: that havÂ« applied in Colorado
and that led up to the struggle In Colorado.
But unfortunately I shall be unable to do
that while the delegates to this convention are
In the city, not being able to procure a suit
able build '.nr at an earlier date. I have had
to trake the date of that lecture the 4th of
December.
If there had been any idea that
Copley would speak violently or with
any degree of fierceness about the re
cent happenings in Colorado such was
speedily dissipated. The text of his
speech is as follows:
Brother President and Delegate* of the
American Federation of Labor: It gives me
the deepest pleasure at this time to appear
btfore thl* body. I see among the delegate*
Ja this convention those with whom I have been
In convention* In pre\-iouÂ» year*, when affll
iated with the American Federation of Labor.
It rives me pleasure a.t thie time to renew
those associations. Briefly I wish to say that
I am gratified to be extended the courtesy of
the floor of this convention for Just a moment,
to thank the officers and member* of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor and thÂ« affiliated
unions for the support, financial and moral,
that hue been extended to the Western Federa
tion of Miners eo nobly during their struggle
In Colorado.
A soecial order was made for the
forenoon to welcome Copley. The
proceedings in that regard were brief
but weighty with significance of what
might be Implied. The convention
had been going some little time when
Copley was greeted. In the interim
the delegates had listened to remarks,
largely by socialistic delegates, re
garding the attitude of federated labor
to the militia of the several States.
An exchange of doubtful courtesies
between those who oppose socialism
and those who favor socialism had
taken place. Then Copley was es
corted to' the platform by one of the
vice presidents of the convention and
Â¦was introduced by President Gompers.
He at once began his address.
WHAT COPLEY SAID.
The American Federation of Labor
and the Western Federation of Miners
yesterday made advances, in public,
toward co-operation. On the side of
the Western Federation of Miners was
E. C. Copley of the miners' executive
board. On the other hand was Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, backed by the
applause of something like 400 dele
pates assembled in convention in
Lyric Hall.
*An apology was made yesterday aft
ernoon by Delegate Berger to John
Mitchell In the convention on account
of the now famous leaflet that figured
in the debate on Monday. The apology
was acepted by Mitchell.
We recommend that all agreements and de
cisions heretofore made by or at the Instance of
the American Federation of Labor between the
brewery workmen, engineers. -firemen and
teamÂ»ters be and are hereby substituted b> a
working agreement upon the following basis.
1 AH brewery employes now members or
the' United Brewery Workmen's Union may re
main such provided that such mÂ«mbÂ«rÂ» of said
United Brewery "Workmen's Union as */Â«?Â»*[
employed as engineer*, firemen or teamsters
may withdraw from that organisation an d J o In
their respective unions rÂ«prerentlng these craft*
without prejudice or discrimination on the part
of their former associates.
â¢> Hereafter the United Brewery Workmen'*
Union shall not admit to membership any en
gineer, fireman or tearoÂ»ter, but shall refer all
applicants, members of these trades, to the re
spective organizations of these trades now af
filiated with the American Federation of Labor
where such organizations exist.
3 All engineers firemen and teamsters em
ployed in braweries shall conform to the law*
and rules and regulations made by that organ
ization of which the majority of the members
of the respective crafts employed In each brew
ery are members. â¢ , .
4 Whenever a majority. Of men employed
a* engineers, firemen or teamsters in any brew
ery are members of the respective union* of
these crafts the organization or organizations
representing such majority shall appoint a
committee to act conjointly with the United
Brewery Workmen's Union In any negotiations
which may arise with the employers, provided
thai the United Brewery Workmen shall have
equal- representation with all other organiza
tions In Joint conference.
5 Failure to comply with the provisions of
this agreement within a period of six month*
after the date of adjournment of this conven
tion shall work a revocation of the charter of
the organization or organlzatins so failing.
All the afternoon, with the exception
of a little time devoted to deciding that
the. convention shall not sit to-day on
account of an excursion of the dele
gates to Vallejo and to also omit all
sessions on Thanksgiving day, was
given to listening to and discussing the
report of the grievance committee.
This committee considers the disa
greements that arise among the unions.
A long and hot debate took place over
the report of the committee on the dif
ficulty between the Brotherhood of
Boilermakers and Iron Ship Builders
and the Bridge and Structural Iron
Workers, but in the end the report was
adopted. A proposition by Delegate
Gilthorpe of the Boilermakers and Iron
Ship Builders to commit to a commit
tee of three was defeated. So also was
the attempt to censure the executive
council in this matter.
During a discussion on another report
Delegate Schwartz asserted that the
woodworkers had tried to take 47,000
men from the mill carpenters. The dis
putes were many, but the reports of the
grievance committee were generally ap
proved. '
Friday morning the consideration of
a report by the grievance committee,
suggesting a plan by which the differ
ences between the brewery workers, en
gineers, firemen and teamsters can be
adjusted, will come before the conven
tion as a special order. The essential
parts of this report, one of the most
important that was submitted, are as
follows: â¢ .
are not asklnp. for paternal charity. If there
la a surplus that belongs to the wage earner
we want it as a return for our daily labor, and
we will take care of the distribution. The way
to Bain that is not by the supplication of the
political supomiticn, but by the building up of
your treasuries and the organizations of your
trades, so that you will not be dependent 'upon
charity in ycur old age.

'Y'HE American Federation of Labor yesterday welcomed E. C. Cop
* lejf of the ex r cutive hoard of the Western Federation of Miners at
Lyric Hall, and advances iv ere made toward union of the two bodies.
Two measures were proposed by the Socialistic delegates in the Ameri- -
can Federation Convention, one forbidding worhingmen to join the
State militia, the other providing for an old-age pension. Sarcasm
was one of the weapons used to rout the Socialists in both instances.
