Testimony as to whether Taggart's ar
rest and confinement were unusual was
ruled out temporarily, though the plain
tiff argued that upon this arrest was
based the cruelty count of the captain's
charges against his wife, it being alleged
that It was unusual, contrary to regu
lations and the result of conspiracy.
" "The custom of becoming intoxicated
is looked down upon, both socially and
officially, in the army," the deponent
said. "It Is one of the strangest things
In the world to put an officer In confine
ment. I never saw it done but once In
my life, when a man was suffering from
delirium tremens. I saw Captain Tag
gart before he wag put Into the hospital
and he was utterly sober. I also knew
It was recorded in the hospital that he
was there for alcoholism. I knew that
It was untrue and that he was put there
to cover u^ the real facts."
In reply to a Question whether, if con-
Eplred against, Taggart could not have
obtained redress through courtmartlal,
the deponent said .the theory of army
discipline was that the presumption was
always in favor of the commanding offi
cer and that to obtain redress Taggart
would have h*"Â»to overcome that pre
sumption.

PORTSMOUTH, N. H., Aug. 7.â Sergius

a special car attached to the Bar. Harbor

crowd of several. hundred persons assem

On crotfs-examination the surgeon had
'\u25a0 testified that he attended. Mrs. Taggart
at Colonel Miner's request, going first to
j the latter's headquarters. There Miner
> told him that Taggart had assaulted his
wife and that she was reported to be in
fear of her life. Miner had called It a
; "very disagreeable occurrence" and ask
ed for the surgeon's advice. Captain
Taggart seemed much distressed and
there was a deal of talk about the af
fair. .Finally Taggart had said he could
perhaps persuade Mrs.". Taggart to with
draw her complaint and asked for per
mission to go to see her. That was re
fused and Tagsart suggested that Col
onel Miner go. Miner refused to go
alone and Colonel Hoff. therefore accom
panied him. â¢ . \
"Her face bore evidence of having b&yi
bruised in some, way," the deponent
went on. "Such a condition might have
resulted from an assault such as the. one

Cole said that Taggart was always very
fond of his children and he never knew
of -'Taggart being Intoxicated. .
The deposition .of Captain Wendell

Morgan at the conclusion of the confer
ence went Immediately to the Corsair,
which sailed about 4 o'clock. .
âQ-YSTER- BAY-, I* 1.,- Aug. 7.â J. Pier
pont .Morgan, of. N_ew. York had a confer
ence; , to-day :wlth I President Roosevelt
lasting an- hour anQ a half. The Presi
dent . himself . is . authority for the state
ment _thait it related practically entirely
to the c a ge oi; the Hankow Railroad, in
China, a controlling interest in which is
owned by J. P. Morgan & Co. Incident
ally, and as relating in a measure to the
railroad^Jnterests' held by Americans in
China, the- pending peace negotiations
formed a .topic of conversation by the
President and Mr! Morgan.
' Morgan came to Oyster Bay unher
alded. While his visit was by appoint
ment, nothing concerning it was permit
ted to leak through official 1 sources until
after ha had gone.;.
Shortly after noon Morgan's big steam
yacht Corsair anchored In the lower bayv
about three-quarters? of a mile from the
Corinthian. Yacht Club, on Center Island.
When observed from the shore she was
flying the absent flag, indicating ordin
arily that her owner was not aboard.
Nevertheless he was there, and in a few
minutes entered ja. steam launch and was
taken ashore: One of the President's car
riages was in waiting 'for him. ' He re
mained for luncheon with the President
and Mrs. Roosevelt and for a time after
ward. r ;'" ...
DID JTOT MEET SHAW.
ThQ suggestion was made that Mor
gan's visit and that of Secretary Shaw a
little earlier might be more than a coin
cidence, but it can be said authoritatively
that they had no relation with each oth
er." Secretary Shaw and M6rgan did not
meet \u25a0 and the purposes of ; their visits
were ; entirely different. ' '
The President and Morgan discussed
fully the Hankow Railroad concession.
This was not the first time the subject
had been considered by the .President.
Several months ago -the . question was
taken up by the President and his Cabi
net and; considered thoroughly. An effort
is. being'; made by the Chinese Govern
ment to purchase, the concession from
the, American-China Development 'Com
pany/ which, owns the concession. .The
railroad/is now. ,. Jn ."operation between
Hankow^ and. Canton, Va distance of. about
thirty niUes pnjy, ... bu^J the,.. company Â»'
which is absolutely "controlled by Ameri-"
.can. capitalists, owns. concessions and,. has.
made surveys for several hundred miles
of railroad nriesi:' \u25a0 ~ ; v;-"" ' ' " 7/
A proposition has' been made by the
Chinese Government \u25a0 to the American-
China Development Company to purchase
the Hankow Railroad and the extension
concessions. It- is understood that the
price offered is about $7,000,000. Some of
the American holders of the stock are
inclined to accept the proposal, but the
European holders, who have a minority
of the stock, insist, as they claim, in the
interest of various foreign countries, that
the road and its concessions be not sold,
but that they remain in control of the
Americans.
AN EXORMOUS ADVANTAGE.
â¢In behalf of. the latter it Is argued that
a railroad in the heart of China, operated
by responsible and aggressive. American^
business men in. connection with the
American steamship lines would be of
enormous : \u25a0 advantage, not only, to the
American producers of all kinds, but to
those of the civilized world generally, it
is said that King Leopold of Belgium,
who owns some of the stock, takes this
view of the situation and is vigorously
opposed to yielding to the proposition of
the Chinese Government. A meeting of
the board o.f directors of the American-
China Development Company is "\u25a0 to Ibe
held in'' Jersey City on the 29th, and it is
expected that at that time a determina
tion will be reached as to the acceptance
of China's offer. ; . .â¢
No "details of the conclusion reached at
the conference between' the President and
Mr. Morgan are obtainable. No informa
tion was obtainable, either- as to -whether
they considered the peace negotiations In
relation to the flotation of a Russian loan
in this country in case the envoys should
reach an agreement which would render

BOARD OF ELECTION COMMISSIONERS.
By JAMES A. DEVOTO. President.
When told of the decision of the
Election Commissioners in regard to
the patients registered at the Alms
house, Foreman Andrews of the Grand
Jury said:
FOREMAN ANDREWS SMILES.
Inmates and employes who have
registered from this precinct but who
have left there within the last thirty
days will not be entitled to vote should
they return there to-day and try to cast
their ballots. If these men" are not
registered in any other precinct it looks
very much as though they will lose
their votes for keeps, as the Election
Commissioners cay they will stand by
may lose: their votes.
themselves a responsibility that belongs
to the Election Board.
A set of resolutions was unanimously
adopted flaying the Grand Jury for its
action in the alleged interference with
the affairs of the commissioners. All
Grand Jury spotters and alleged political
workers are warned not to Intimidate
any voters within 100 feet of the polls at
the primaries to-day. ... '
This warning may mean trouble, for
the Grand Jury has a large force of men
under its command at the present time
who are supposed to look out for things
to-day. These man are called "watch
ers" and are supplied with badges de
noting their office.
When the question of the voters at
the Almshouse was . raised a
lengthy discussion was the re
sult. It was. ln this precinct that . all
the trouble occurred at the last pri
mary election and the Grand Jury has
paid special attention to registration
there since that time. The Election
Board decided that all voters who have
been inmates of the place for the last
thirty days are entitled to voto to-day.

The Labor League is as determined to
day as it was at the beginning of the
contest that the false position Schmitz
maintains in posing as a friend of the
unions shall be exposed and he be made
to see that they understand his dirty
politics.
"They tried to throw me out, but
couldn't. They circulated infamous lies
concerning my actions in this campaign,
but I .am back here doing my best to
down Ruefâ and I will." Thus said Tim
R. Sullivan last night, speaking of the
Ruef-McCarthy efforts to injure him with
the union men.
Tim R. Sullivan, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee of the United Labor
League, last night- presented each of the
district captains orders for the purpose
of carrying on a systematic fight against
the Ruef organization at the polls to
day. The offices at 3 Eddy street were
crowded with honest voters anxious to do
their duty in suppressing the evils here
tofore attending municipal elections.
Instructions were given to voters in
precincts in every one of the Assembly
districts to be present at the scenes of
balloting so as to prevent the frauds.
Men "of honesty and influence will turn
out, making it a certainty that the Ruef
crowd will be watched carefully.
Many union men about the headquar
ters were heard to denounce the actions
of P. H. McCarthy in wielding his influ
ence for Schmitz during this campaign,
when he was so violently opposed to him
last time.
Beware of "United Republican League"
and "Republican Primary League" tick
ets. These organizations went out of ex
istence years ago. The grafters have res
urrected the name to interpose an ele
ment of confusion in the contest. " Every
little trick and dodge that can be worked
to deceive the honest voter will be work
ed to-day by the cunning grafters.
Citizens are advised to pay no attention
to blustering attaches of the Schmitz ad
ministration who may attempt to "shoo"
honest citizens away from the voting
booths and incidentally frighten a timid
citizen. It can be safely asserted that
the Republicans who have enlisted in the
battle to wrest San Francisco from bood
lors and grafters will not be chased away
from the voting booths.
The proper thing for the honest citizen
to do Is to examine the list of delegates
before leaving his home, and when he
makes sure that he has the anti-Ruef
ticket then go to the voting booth and
vote it. : 5 "" :
The league has covered every detail of
initial and progressive work. The ballot
for good government has been placed ln
the hand of every registered voter. It
now remains for the citizens themselves
to do their duty and vote the antl-Ruef
ticket. If the taxpayers and other good
citizens on whom the Republican League
relies for support prove apathetic and
irresolute the grafters will win the bat
tle. The citizen who argues to himself,
"I will not take the trouble to vote, be
cause my vote will not be needed any
way," is half a grafter and a common
skulker. The vote of every good man
is needed because the grafters are well
organized, num/rous and desperate. That
some of the ringleaders of graft will go
to the penitentiary can hardly be doubt
ed, as they have planned to commit'
crimes against the election law.
Despite all the clamor and threats of
the Schmltz-Ruef Board of Election Com
missioners, watchers under the authority
of the Grand Jury will watch the stuff
ers and lodge information- that will cause
the arrest and lead to the con
viction of offenders. The Grand
Jury Is acting on the advice
of the District Attorney, who holds that
any citizen has the right to be vigilant
in the cause of the law's observance. If
the subservient police attempt to molest
citizens ln their rights under the law
there will be a day of reckoning for the
police.
Voters in every district should 6can
their tickets closely. Tickets of the San
Francisco Republican League are plainly
lettered "Anti-Ruef." The grafters may
resort to the dodge of stuffing In a few
Ruefters under the guise of Republican
League tickets.
BewareÂ»of so-called "Regular Republi
can tickets." They are regular in one re
spect only, and that is i.icy are Ruef
tickets. Ruef's money paid for the print
ing of such tickets. The only Republican
ticket that has the declared recognition
of the governing body of the Republican
party, the County Committee, is the
ticket of the San Francisco Republican
League. It is Anti-Ruef in name and in
fact-
The executive committee of the league,
consisting of George D. Clark, president;
Daniel A. Ryan, secretary; Fairfax H.
Wheelan, David Rich, John D. Daly,
John Lackmann, E. J. Bowes and Rich
ard J. Welch, met last night and gave
final instructions to district workers and
challengers. Since the organization of
the committee, immediately after the
open meeting of 300 leading Republican
citizens ln Pioneer Hall, the campaign
for a clean city, clean politics and a clean
administration has been conducted in a
manly, liberal fashion. The work for the
betterment of the city has been open and
aboveboard.- Representatives of every
district in the city have had a fair hear
ing. Men were urged to put aside per
sonal prejudices and factional strife in
order to unite all the forces of good citi
zenship in the common cause of rescuing
the city from the rule of grafters.
Looters and job holders attached to the
Ruef-Schmitz administration, observing
that the league movement was growing
formidable, set up the cry of "Citizens'
Alliance" to influence the wage-earners of
the city against the new organization,
but the workingmen were not as easily
duped as the boss of the grafters expect
ed. The fact was published that not a
single member of the executive commit
tee belonged to the Citizens' Alliance.
The additional fact was also given to the
public that 169 of the league's proposed
delegates to the Republican convention
were active and loyal trades union men.
In the hearts of the workingmen of the
town there is no feeling of enmity to
ward the San Francisco Republican
League, and to-day thousands, of wage
earners of Republican faith will rejoice
in the success of the league tickets and
the downfall of the grafters.
Citizens marching under the banner of
the San Francisco Republican League
will go to the polls to-day inspired by the
prospects of victory. To the headquar
ters of the league the report comes from
every Assembly district of the city that
men who have hitherto neglected to vote
at primary elections will do their duty
this day.

Leaders and followers of the San Francisco Republican League are -convinced
that a record-breaking primary election vote will be polled to-day." Enthusi
astic forecasters predict that the vote will approximate 50,000. It is , the
deliberate judgment of political experts that nearly if not quite 40,000 ballots
will be deposited. The forces of the League are absolutely confident of |
success. The feeling that victory is in sight prevails along the entire line of
battle. That the Ruef forces are weakening is evidenced by the fact that
Jesse Marks yesterday offered to bet $1000 with Henry Ach on the proposi
tion that the San Francisco Republican League would win a majority of the
delegates to the convention and the latter declined to accept the wager.
The significant assurance comes that hundreds of labor union men who have
been importuned to go outside of their own party and vote for Ruef delegates
to the Republican convention have flatly refused to take the boss programme.
The regular Republican ticket is that of the San Francisco Republican League.

The romantic comic opera "Rob Roy"
continues to attract large and appreci
ative audiences to the^ TJvoll Opera
house. ' . â¢
Powerful again Is Mr. Glickman's scene'
where Shylock Is told of Antonio's fail
ures, and the whole conception is distin
guished by restraint and a notable real
ism. But it has not the "pull" of hia
Lear. It has not that which draws all
eyes to. the figure wherever It is, and
whatever it is. doing. It will to : night
without doubt have more of the quality,
and to-morrow night more, and at. any
rate no Shakespeare lover can afford to
miss the performance.
Miss Clara Raffaele Is the Portia, with
out any particular reason to be. Miss
Eva Katz lilted cleverly enough from
Fliegende Blaetter fun to a fair Nerissa.
But there was a Jessica, the best I have
seen, a sly, deceitful, piquant minx, and
pretty as they make them, in Miss Minnie
Berlin. Bernhard Schoengold looked more
like Cupid than ever as Bassanio and
acted pleasantly. Mr. Goldberg was the
Antonioâ and you forgave Shylock.
The play goes every night this week.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Shakespeare pureâ more or less â the
Yiddish players gave at the Grand Opera
house last night. "The Merchant of
Venice" was the play, Ellis T. Glickman
the merchant. The house was small with
the exception of Nat Goodwin, who
loomed large in a- box and followed the
text with devoted attention.
On the whole the play adheres pretty
closely to the original. It is translated
into lairly good Geiman and is without
musical interruptionsâ as Kolb and Dill
like it. A scene in which Shylock tells
Jessica that her mother was murdered
by the Christians, and in saving her (Jes
sica's) life, was the most interesting va
riant. Palpably, and as my charming
interpretor explained to me, the scene is
a concession to the strong family love
that exists among the Jews, and further
explains Shylock'B hatred of the Chrifc
tians.
Shylock In the scene asks Jessica if she
:s weeping for the sorrows of the He
brews; Jessica says, "No, eh'e has too
many troubles of her own to worry about.
The Jews have been suffering for 1000
years, she says, and through their 6lns,
so why ehould she worry?"
Ophelia in a hoopskirt is taken gravely
by the Japanese â Otto Kawakami plays
the Hamlet to her In an English admiral's
uniformâ so why should we stumble over
a Portia in spectacles? Hiss Clara Raf
faele plays her that way. Slightly dis
tracting also Is the "Carmen" bridge,
duly labeled "Seville," that bulks behind
Shylock's house. And the "Intermezzo"
from "Cavalleria" that the masquers sing
in the act. And the shirt-sleeved stage
hands that wander in comfortably to do
things.
The Elizabethan folk forgot that a
spade was a spade when it was labeled
"this is a broom," and there were mo
ments, many moments last night, when
the rather crude stage enginery was
forgotten. They were mostly Mr. Gllck
man's moments, and what were not be
longed to the Jessica. And Mr. Glickman
was not at his best. Nine performances
a week and the management of them,
with the five or six new plays weekly
that the Glickman company has given,
does not leave much to play a big Shy
lock on. It was the vitality, the magnet-
Ism, that was lacking, the vitality that
made Mr. Glickman's Lear such a com
pelling figure In spite of its incongruous
surroundings. His ShylocS Is eminently
dignified and has a supple Italian Quality
in places that Is very cleverly character
istic. Nor did his trial scene lack for
power, and his poses here, magnificently
picturesque, were alone worth going to
see. So, too,, were his entrance In this
scene, assured of his "rights yet fearful
of the Christian dogs, and his exit here.
Less broken Is his than Irvlng"s Shylock
here, because. In the Jewish edition,
Shylock Is not asked to become a Chris-

THREE MEN KILLED
BY AN EXPLOSION
These words explained the rulddal ac
tion of Mrs. Augusta Hartke:, who was
taken to the Central Emergency. Hospital
last night with a deep gash in her throat.
The woman is probably demented.
According to Mrs. Hartke's story, her
husband is a Janitor and elevator operator
at .1111 Washington street. Oakland. Mrs.
Hartke : conducts a lodging-house at 1509
Folsom Btreet. Repeatedly, she avers, her
husband has pleaded with her to go to
the . "goose walks" and live with him.
The woman refused, seeking death as
.more consoling than life in the little burg
across the water.
About 6:30 p. m. roomers In Mrs. Hart
ke's house on Folsom street heard mani
acal words from Mrs. Nartke.
. ; "Death, . death, sweet death, Is better
: than Oakland for me," ehe cried- Assist
ance was summoned and Mrs. Hartke was
found lying In a pool of blood.
At the Central Emergency Hospital Dr.
Reuben C. Hill found Mrs. Hartke to be
not seriously Injured; His opinion Is that
the woman was "demented.
"I couldn't stand the life In Oakland, so
I cut my throat. My husband told me if

Cure Forjhe Blues
ORE MEDICINE THAT HAS KEYER FAILED
Health Fully Restored and the Joy ef
Ufe Regained
When a cheerful, brave, light-hearted
woman is suddenly plunged into that
perfection of misery, the BLDES, it is
ft sad picture. It is usually this way :
She has been feeling' ''out of sorts"
for some time; head has ached and
back also ; has slept poorly, been quite
nervous, and nearly fainted once or
twice; head dizzy, and heart-beats very
fast ; then that bearing-down feeling,
and during her menstrual period she Is
exceedingly despondent. Nothing
pleases her. Her doctor sayi : "Cheer
up : you have dyspepsia ; yon will be
all right soon."
But she doesn't get " all right," and
hope vanishes; then come the brood-
ing, morbid, melancholy, everlasting
BLDES.
Don't wait until your sufferings have
driven you to despair, with your nerves
all shattered and your courage gone,
but take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound. See what it did for
Mrs. Rosa Adams, of 819 12th street,
Louisville, Ky., niece of the late Gen-
eral Roger Hanson, C.S. A. She writes:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â
\u2666* I cannot tell yon with pen and ink what
Lydia E. Pinkbanrs Vegetable Compound
hat done for me. I suffered with ft male
troubles, extreme lassitude, * the blues,'
nervousness and that aU-jjone feeling. I was
advised to try Lydia E. Pinkham's V egetable
Compound, and it not only cured my female
derangement, but it has restored me to perfect
health and strength. The buoyancy of ray
younger days has returned, and I do not suf-
fer any longer with despondency, as I did be-
fore. I consider Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound a boon to sick and suffering
women."
If you have some derangement of
the female organism write Mrs.
Pinkham, Lyna, Mass., for advice.

VICTORIA, B. C. Aug. 7.â George D.
Collins, the San Francisco lawyer, whose
extradition is asked by the ' State of Cal
ifornia for perjury, stands to-night close
to the point where he will be placed in
the hands of the United States authori
ties. Judge Lampman to-day decided
against him on the final points which he
has raised, refusing to dismiss him.
Judge Lampman, after declaring that
he would not discharge the prisoner,
asked Collins if he wished to call wit
neTses in his defense. H. D. Helmcken,
counsel for Collins, then rose and asked
that an opportunity be given for consul
tation with his client as to the advisa
bility of calling witnesses. Judge Lamp
man gave him until 10:30 o'clock to-mor
row morning to decide.
When the hearing opene"d Collirm ar
gued that it had to be actually proved
that the oath was administered and that
the accused had delivered the affidavit
purporting it to be true for the purpose
of misleading. The making of a false af
fidavit, was not sufficient to prove per
jury, he said. Collins said that Henry's
evidence was to the effect that he knew
nothing about the aflldavit after, it was
sworn to. It was not proved that the
affidavit left the office of the accused
with the latter's consent. It ( was ob
tained, according to Collins, from a clerk
In the office.
As Collins has no witnesses here it Is
thought he will be committed for extra
dition by Judge Lampman to-morrow
morning. He may then appeal to a Su
preme Court Judge for habeas corpus
proceedings.
Alford said the Pullman Company never
gave any figures, but he considered the
assessment too low, and moved that it be
fixed at $600,000, but received no second.
President Brown announced that the
San Francisco real estate dealers desired
to be heard with reference to the assess
ment of that city. He added that the
Los Angeles representatives were to ap
pear on August 22, and he understood
they intended to ask that the San Fran
cisco assessment be raised. A Los Ange
les man, Brown continued, claimed . his
city was assessed at 50 per cent of its full
value, while San Francisco was assessed
at-25-per cent of its valuation. He pre
dicted there would be- a warm session
if the two delegations came together In
the board room. August 23 was fixed as
the day jto Invite the Assessor of San
Francisco to be heard, with the under
standing that his county was not form
ally cited to appear.
The California Motor was reassessed at
$60,000. the Carson and Colorado at $200,
000. the California and Northwestern at
$2,000,000 and the North Shore at $500,000.
There is no material change in any of
these assessments from last year.
The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
system was then taken up. and Beamer
moved that the assessment be placedjat
$12,000,000. It was seconded by Mattison.
Alford tried, without success, to raise it
to $17,158,000, then $14,703,000, but the orig
inal motion prevailed.
The Pacific Coast Company's road was
assessed at $250,000; the Pajaro Valley at
$150,000; the Nevada County narrow
gauge at $112,500: Nevada, California and
Oregon at $225,000: Sierra Varley Railroad
at ?43,776: Alameda and San Joaquin at
$150,000. The Sierra Railway of California
was assessed at $417,670; the Gualala Mill
road at $40,000; Lake Tahoe road at $50,
000; the Boca and Loyalton at $300,000;
San Pedro. Los Angeles and Salt Lake
Railway at $920,140 and the Pullman Com
pany at $500,000.
Mattison moved to assess the Southern
Pacific system at $35,891,400. It was sec
onded by Colgan. Alford moved to
amend by making it $50,799,000 and then
$52,113,000, and later $42,428,000, each time
receiving no second to his motion. The
original motion prevailed. This is a slight
increase over last year's assessment. The,
South Pacific Coast Railroad was as
sessed at $1,009,G50, the same as last year,
by the unanimous vote of the board.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 7.â The State
Board of Equalization followed last
year's figures closely to-day in fixing the
assessments of the property of the vari
ous railroads in California. "William H.
Alford made several attempts to raise
the figures, but without success. Beamer
moved that the assessment of the Central
Pacific system be fixed at 515,000,000, the
same as last year. Mattison seconded
the motion and Alford moved to amend
by raising the figure to *23,2Â«,000. He re
ceived no second and then named $19,923,
433. This also met no second, and the
original figure of $15,000,000 was carried
by the votes of all the members save Al
ford.

SEATTLE, Aug. 7. â A special letter
to the Seattle Times from Fairbanks,
Alaska, under date of July 6. says that
a flood raging In Chena for several
days had rendered homeless from 700
to 1000 people. The flood was caused
by a wind and rain storm that had re
cently swept the Tenana Valley. Keyes"
sawmill had been swept away and car
ried down the stream, being: lodged In
front of Xoyes* mill. A large lofr boom
broke from its moorings at the Tenana
Development Company's mill and was
carried down stream entailing a loss
of several thousand dollars. Cellars
were flooded - and in a few instances
stock drowned. " - .'.'."

Mary T. Wilson, principal of the -new
school, was formerly a teacher "in -the
Lincoln School. She dared to express her
opinion regarding the vaccination matter,
and when the School Directors . .elected
teachers this year Mrs.' Wflson's name
was not on the list of those chosen. It
was 6aid that the fact of her., being a
married woman had inspired the Board of
Education to drop her, but the Anti-Vac
cination League people believe that she
was dismissed for her devotion to their
principles.
The league has engaged Mrs. .Wilson to
direct the new school, and will soon pro
vide her with assistants. At a meeting
of the league to-morrow ntght this matter
will be discussed, and at a meeting of
the directors of the school on Wednesday
the question of providing Tiigh-school'in
struction will be considered.
The funds for the maintenance of the
school have been subscribed by members
of the league. More than $100 a month is
pledged to support the undertaking. The
children of very poor- people will be edu
cated without cost to the parents. Golden
Sheaf Hall is donated by J. G. Wright.
Mrs. WUson said to-day: "The class of
children in our school is of a high order
of intelligence, such as might be expected
from parents' who dare to protest and
take action in defense of their, principles.
The notion that the league members are
â¢cranks' Is a silly idea, and a glance at
the children we have enrolled would setf
tie any such notion. I have had a dozen
years of . experience as a teacher, and can
Judge pretty well. of the caliber pf chil
dren as a result of that experience. .1 do
not hesitate to say that "our children here
are far more intelligent in appearance,
judging by their work thus far, than any
seventy-five children .. that might be se
lecied at ;â¢ random :from -.. the .public
schools." - ''yy % ""' -
DrrS. H.'Frazler, president of the Anti-
Compulsory Vaccination League, and
Mrs; Mary V. Holloway, secretary ofthe
league, * visited the school to-day and ex
pressed themselves ac highly pleased with
the work done.thus far and the prospect
for the future. .. - \u25a0. -\u0084 \u0084
Seventy-five pupils answered t the roll
call as Mrs. Wilson read their names
from the list on her desk. . Before the' end
of the week the antl-vacclnatlon .'folk ex
pect that the J attendance j will . be j about
100. There are a number of. children now
in the public schools without certificates
who have*yet to pass the-.ten-day limit
set by the Board of Education. These
children, It is supposed, will, - later find
their ' way ! into ; the' antl-vaccinatidri
school.
BERKELEY*; Aug. TVâ "'.The' sghpoT will'
come to order." said -Mrs. . Mary T. Wil

faced the pupils who represent the pro

vaccination of children/and with those
words the machinery of a. unique project
was put into motion. . . .. , . .s,. .
In Golden Sheaf Hall, on Addison
street, the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination
League has planted its banners, and there
it bids defiance to the school 'and. State
authorities who insist that children at
tending the public schools shall all show
certificates indicating that they have been
vaccinated. In this hall the league has
established a private school, where no
such certificates are required ot children.
The school is intended to stand as a mon
ument of protest against the law that
is obnoxious to the league. Its first ses

SAN RAFAEL* Aujr. 7.â The controver
sy which has existed for a year and a
half between the Marin County- â¢ Water
Company and the Board ot Supervisors
of Martn County over the condemnation
of a few miles of the Bolinas road for
reservoir purposes was practically ami
cably settled at the meeting of the Board
| of Supervisors this afternoon.
. President A. "W. Foster of the water
company, accompanied by Jesse W. Ul
ienthal, his attorney, appeared before the
board In regard to the condemnation of
the road for reservoir purposes. Foster
asked the board to abandon about SOOO
feet of road on the Lagunitas highway ao
the company could build a dam at th*
Junction of Williams and Phoenix
gulches, which Is about two miles from
Ross Station. He urged the board to
build a i road higher up, according to a
"provision In the old right of way dw^L
He also made a proposition in regard to
the road in controversy, saying that If
the county would abandon the portion
needed for the reservoir and dam tha
company would build the new road at lta
own expense, the route to be selected by
three disinterested parties. \u25a0
The board, recognizing: the necessity of
a greater water supply, agreed to con
struct the new road in Phoenix Gulch
and agreed to stand the expense of secur
ing the right of way, the water company
to build the new road. The company will
file a petition to-morrow, and the Super
visors will appoint two disinterested
road viewers and the company one. If

To-day at noon Schneider was again
taken over to the Blaker house to show
Sheriff Barnet where Blaker's blood
stained trousers had been hidden. They
were found tucked away behind the roof
of a closet in the rafters. In regard to
them, Schneider said: "Blaker showed me
his corduroy pants and said, 'I have these
pants here with blood on them; what had
1 better do with them? Maybe I had bet
ter burn them.' He had been trying to
wash them, and I said, 'They are co wet
they will not burn; you had better throw
them up in the attic' I gave him a. boost
up to. a place where he could get on top
cf a closet and he stuck them where I
showed them to you."
The informations charging all three of
the boys with murder were made out by
District Attorney Allen to-day and were
then taken over to Justice of the Peace
\V. R. Geary, in East Oakland, where
Constable Carroll swore to them. The
exact date for the arraignment of the
boys has not been decided upon.
I ran away before they completed the job
and when I cot uj> the next nioming I went
over to Bluker's house early and whistled for
him. tp I wanted to find out what he had
done. He came out when he heard me whiÂ»
tie, aa we we-e going to San Francisco to
epend tht day, and he asked me why I ran
away. I said that I did not want to have
anything to do with it. and he then i gave me
*:Â»> and told me he had ?20 for himself.
WÂ« went under the house and he pointed
out the brick to me and said, "The money is
buried right under there and I will divide it
â¢with you Bnd Pembroke Monday morning."
We were arrested that r.ight, bo he never got
a chance to divide It. I don't know whether
Pembroke got any cf the money or not.
BLOODSTAINED TROUSERS.
In telling cf his meeting with Blaker
the morning 1 after the robbery, Schneider
said:
He' waÂ» directed : to diff ttae money up,
end he quickly pulled the brick away
and, scratching down in the soft earth
with his lingers, produced a paper par
cel. . After unrolling considerable paper
the officers came to a handkerchief in
which there was $123 in gold, one $20
greenback and one $1 greenback. Schnei
der statfed that Blaker had given him $20
the next morning when they went to San
Francisco and had $20 himself, and says
that he does not know where the rest of
it went to- If there was any more taken
from Cook. ;"â¢â¢
IV was after midnight last night that
Schneider, In talking with Chief Jailer
Peter White, finally admitted to him that
he knew where' the money was hidden
and told him that if he would take him
oui to Â£ Kruityale lie' would show him
where 'ii was concealed. White got into
communication with Sheriff Barnet- and
at 1 o'clock this .morcing Barnet, accom
panied l>y Constable Tom Carroll, drove
Sclmeider out to Fruitvale. - The officers
\u25a0were directed to go to the Blaker homr
at 1221 Fruitvale avenue. With the- aid of
a lantern they went down into the bas^,
mer.t and were led up under the front
part of the house, near the stfcps, where
Schneider pointed to a brick, the surface
of wljich wae-fiucsh witji the ground,' -and
said: "It is hidden under that."'
DIGS I I* THE MONEY.
This evidence. Sheriff Barnet says,
makes his case complete against the
three youths who- to-day were formally
charged before Justice of â¢ the Peace
Geary with ihc murder of Cook, the com
plaints being sworn to by Constable Tom
Carroll.
There is little now toabe added to the
etory of the crime as toid in the confes
sions of Schneider and Pembroke. Schnei
der's <?ap. found at the scene of the rob
bery; the bludg-eons, which Pembroke
confesses to hav<? made; the money lound
burled undor Blaker's home; the pockets
of the trousers he wore that night being
etained with blood, all point an accusing
linger at each one of the three boys ana
make such a complete chain of evidence
against them that, without the confes
sions, the facts now in the possession of
the Sheriff would leave little doubt as to
tht guilt of all of them.
OAKLAND, Aug. 7.â The place where
was hidden part of the money taken by
George Blaker, Percy Pembroke and John
Schneider from Thomas W. Cook. whose
death ensued from wounds inflicted by
the robbers, was disclosed by John
Schneider to Sheriff Barnei to-day. This
part of the plunder was buried, under
linker's home. There was $146 there, and
Schneider Fays that the rest of the plun
der was spent. He also showed the Sher
iff where Blakt-r had hidden his bloody
trousers, from which he had endeavored
to wash the blood stains, but the pockets
of which are still red with the blood that
covered the money as Blaker stowed it
away.

The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution providing that the
sum of 53300 b<S set aside out of the
appropriation of $350,000 in the budget
of the fiscal year 1905-1906 for the con
struction of the' Geary-street railroad
for the purpose of enabling the City
Engineer to prepare and transmit to
the Board of Supervisors plans and
specifications In detail of said road as
ordered by resolution No. 6159 of said
board, approved July 24, 1905. The
money is to be expended under' the
joint direction of the- Committees on
Public Utilities and Finance of the
Board of Supervisors and of the City
Engineer.
The board adopted resolutions con
gratulating 1 the municipal government
of Los Angeles on its acquisition of
water rights entitling it to bring 390,
000.000 gallons of water daily from the
Sierra Nevada Mountains,, the' United
States Government having; relinquished
its contemplated plan of utilizing such
waters J for the Owens River, reclama
tion project. J The resolution continues:
In granting the franchise the same should be
conditioned upon the construction of suitable
steel or masonry bridges ror the tracks over
the streets at the crossings- .where the differ
ence between the elevation of the streets and
the rails is sufficient to^ permit the use of
bridges. Where the roadway of a street is al
ready â¢ improved it should ' be reconstructed to
the new grade by the 'comimny whenever the
bridges are constructed. Tnere should also, he
a provision about the. railway crossing of the
proposed boulevard to be constructed east of
Lake M*rced.
The board requested the Board of
Works to negotiate with the United
Railroads . for at least two sprinkling
cars in order to utilize the 1,000,000
gallons of salt water daily offered by
the Merchants" Ice Company. Super
visor Eggers urged that steps be taken
to make the offer available. / Commis
sioner A*igeltinger stated that negotia
tions are under way to have Mission
street, sprinkled.
The following ordinances were finally
passed:
Providing for full ' acceptance of blocks on
Lake. Virksburg, California and Pierce streets
and Second avenue. ' '
Accepting a deed- from Jacob Heytnan Com
pany to lands for the opening of Boutelle

A study has been made to eliminate as many
grade crossings as possible aÂ»d to determine
the most feasible grades for the various streets
and avenues â¢ that are crossed by the proposed
track location. .It is proposed to change the
proposed track elevation ano- modify the align
ment to as to minimize the necessary changes
in the official grades, and this modification is
acceptable to the Ocean Snore Company.
The railway tracks will run through private
property eoutji ' of .Army street Instead of on
Army street; through private property between
Marer.ro street ani Barnevaid avenue, instead
of on Maengo tttreet and through private prop
erty between Huron and Wyoming avenues,
crossing Wyoming avenue at Sherman avenue
instead of on Wyoming avenue for two blockr.
The railway from Illinois street to the coun
ty lin* will cross flfty-t-ix streets, 'avenues and
alleys. Of these the railway will run length
wise on tour streets, three streets' will cross
over the railway on bridges, seventeen streets
will pass under the track with no less than
fourteen feet of clear head room, and thirty
two will cross the railway at grade. Of these
grade crossings nine are in me proposed eec
tion that is to be used for yard \u25a0 purposes and
the balance in no case will poobably ever be
used as thoroughfares. .... To oring the, roadbed
of. the park branch line within the maximum
grade of 10 per cent will require a change of
grade on C street between Fifteenth and Six
teenth'avenues. Twentieth and. Twenty-first
avenues and Forty-first anc Forty-secona ave
nues.
City Engineer Woodward yesterday
filed with the Board of Supervisors his
report on the petition of the Ocean
Shore Railroad Company for a fran
chise to operate a railroad on certain
streets in this, city, together with the
necessary grade changes necessitated
thereby. The general route of the pro
posed road is to extend from Illinois
street, near Army street, southerly to
a point on the southern county bound
ary near the Pacific Ocean; and also ex
tending â¢ from Eleventh avenue and C
street westerly and southerly to con

Word was received from headquarters Mon
day by the local agent at this point to the
effect that the work of laying the bread-gauge
rails from Sodaville into TonaDah would be
commenced within the next ten days. \u25a0It ifl
estimated that it will require about thirty-six
hours to complete the task, as all that remains
to be done, now that the railroad has been
graded into Tonopah^ is the placing of but a
j-ineie line of rail from Sodavllle to that point.
The Southern Pacific Company Is hastening
work on the Hazen cut-off near Churchill, the
intention being to save nearly an hour in the
running time of trains into the camp thereby.
As soon as the rails are laid the present ter
minus at Sodaville will be moved to New
Boston, a a neither Sodaville nor Hawthorne
will be tapped by the new route. Immediately '.
thereafter a through train, to be known as the
South Nevada flier, will be put on between

to increase the mine output at Copperop

for running the three furnaces the pro
duction of copper will be large.
The Grass Valley Union reports that
there is considerable activity among tho
mines about Forest City. Men are at
work at the Mabel Mertz mine extend
ing a tunnel to tap a gravel channel. A
tunnel in the South Fork mine has come
close to the gravel, it Is supposed. Work
has been going on steadily at the Wiscon

The Golden King gravel mine will be re
opened by a ir>mpany of Grass Valley
owners. The tunnel is to be extended
toward the gravel as fast as possible.
The Columbia Mining Company expects
to reach gravel before winter.

Concerning recent mining development
in Amador Coutny the Amador Ledger
reports in part as follows:
â¢ It is reported that good ore has been struck
in the Lincoln ground, now operated by the
Wildman-llahcney company in running the
drift at the depth of 2010 feet toward the Ma
honey work*. This will impart new life to
Sutter Creek. The company has been handl
capr>ed by the Indebtedness incurred for back
wages, but has struggled along: In the face of
all difficulties. The discovery of a good ore
body in an unexpected quarter will enable the
company to tide over the financial troubles
and ulaee the property on a gocd working
basis.
One of the largest mining deals that has
taken place in Shasta County recently is
reported by the Copper Outlook. The
Summit mines have been sold by George
Graves and others to a New York syndi
cate for a large sum, the amount not be

put a large force of men on development
work at once, according to current re

Much work is in progress at the mines
in Sierra City. The Downleville Messen
ger reports that after the tramway of
the Mountain Mine, was destroyed
by fire, shall be replaced large improve-
John D. McGillvray mattes some in
teresting statements concerning dredg
ing In the -Vtiin country. A few years
ago the Atlin country was the cause of
a stampede of miners from Canada, prin
cipally from British Columbia, and also
from the northern part of the United
Stales, but results were not satisfactory,
the main reason being that the Canadian
laws and regulations were objectionable.
Atlin was not a "poor man's camp," but
of those who went in there were a num
ber who saw big opportunities for dredg
ing, such as is done at Oroville, or
hydraulicking cr hydraulic elevating or
steam shoveling.
The&e men contented themselves with
acquiring large acres of gravel, coral-ng
water rights and waiting to find capital.
It was evident to them that there was
no use to attempt to do anything with
little money.
Mr. McGlllivray has visited the country.
He says that there are mere acres of
gravel of high value than there are at
Oroville. Fclsom and the other dredging
districts of California.
After a year or two of waiting and
promoting, some Philadelphia people came
alorg and tcok up a few hundred acres
to dredge. They put up an electric plant,
built a dredge of the modern type and
lound that it paid. They rcalfzed one
dollar per cubic yard at a cost of twenty
cents per cubic yard. As a result the
entire Atlin country, or at least 25,000
acres of gravel, is new to be exploited.
It is understood by Alaskans that the
values are h!gher than those of Oroville
or Folsom, or, in fact, almost of any
part of the dredging districts in the
United States. Yet the cost of working is
higher on account of the shortness of
the season and hardness of the ground.
Values have been proved, says Mr. Mc
<Jiliivray, that average one dollar a cubic
yard for 7000 acres, and most of the en
gineers who have investigated claim an
average of more than fifty cents a cubic
yard for a depth of thirty feet over an
area of 25,000 acres. If these estimates
are correct this means that Atlin ought
to yield mere than the Oroville and Fol
som districts combined. All the machin
ery work, engineering and exporting on
the :nain properties have been performed
by Californians, although much of the
capital Ims been furnished by moneyed
men of Philadelphia and other Eastern
cities.

TO ADDRESS A LETTERâ Constant
Reader, City. The proper way to address
a letter for delivery In a city is to place
on the envelope the name of the party,
that of the city, that of the State and
the street and number, then the letter,
cannot go astray. Some too tired tq
write use the word "city" or "local."
but it might happen that a person hav
ing a letter intended for delivery In San
Francisco and addressed either ."city" or
"local" might be 1- Oakland, and If he
should drop the letter la a box in that
city, the letter would not be delivered to
the party for whom intended!

way to keep the pores of the skin open
and In good working order is to take dally

excessive and continuous transpiration
the party affected should consult \u25a0> repu

The new postoffice and court building is one of the finest Fed
eral buildings in the country. Its general exterior plan follows
closely the new Congressional Library building in Washington,
which is admitted to be one of the great buildings of the world.
The new postoffice, in its interior finish and exterior nobility of
architecture, is an ornament to San Francisco and an honor to the
Federal Government. While there has been some impatience at
the time taken for its completion, it is to be occupied ahead of the
new postoffice in Chicago, which was started first.
The proposition of the Merchants' Exchange and other rep
resentative bodies to formally celebrate the opening and occupancy
of the structure should be carried out. Other cities make much of
such occasions. The cornerstone of the Chicago Postoffice was
laid by the President of the United States, and that city had much
ceremony and much advertising out of it. The only ceremony in
laying the cornerstone of our postoffice was when the stonemason
spat tobacco on the mortar and lowered the stone to its seat. Now.
that the building is finished and all of its architectural beauties are
exhibited, San Francisco can afford a holiday to celebrate an event
important in our local .history.
SAN FRANCISCO'S new postoffice and court building, on the
corner of Mission and Seventh streets, is nearly ready for oc
cupancy.. As soon as it has housed the Federal courts the
Appraisers' building will be fitted to temporarily shelter the Cus
tom-house, and then the old postoffice will be torn down and a new
Custom-house covering the entire frontage on Battery street will
be erected.

No one wants to invest in its policies, and if this condition con
tinue it will have to face liquidation, convert its assets, distribute
them to its policy holders, and go out of business. It is to-prevent
this that the immense effort is being made to restore "it to public
confidence. It is felt that this process will be much accelerated
by forcing restoration to its treasury of the vast amounts that it is
alleged were diverted. If this is done the Equitable may resume
its place as a strong financial concern.
In the loss of confidence it does not suffer alone.," for in its
lapse all the heavy insurance companies share. The effect upon
insurance is more marked than that produced by the failure of the
Charter Oak, which, though a sad crash, was limited in its injury
to the company concerned. The Charter Oak policy holders re
newed their insurance fearlessly in other companies. Now there
is a disposition to fight shy of all.
Insurance companies must find remunerative employment for
their capital. Only in this way can they pay their policies. The
trouble with the Equitable seems to have been that it employed too
much of its capital in paying princely salaries to persons who held
sinecures and performed no service, and that its managers were in
the habit of loaning its money to other corporations, which; they
controlled, for speculative purposes. .; If .this differ any.- from*' the
president of a bank loaning its deposits to himself, the difference
must be shown to his Honor the Judge who will try the case.
The marvelous financial strength of the Equitable is shown
by the fact that, notwithstanding all the waste and diversion of its
funds, it is still probably the strongest insurance corporation in
the world. But it must make good before it can do any more busi
ness. Reports from all over the country show that the disclosures
made concerning its profligate management have practically cut ofi
new business.
IX the suit against the managers of the Equitable, the State of
New York aims her gun at big game. Belmont, Depew, D. O.
Mills, E. H. Harriman and J. J. Hill are n.o common defendants.
They, are able to give the Empire State a stiff fight and the Equita
ble policy holders have the comfort of knowing that if they are
beaten they~ v are amply able to respond to a judgment and can
hardly beat a decree on the execution. None of them can escape
by way of the poor debtor's oath, and there is not -room enough
in the country to hide their, assets.
"Brethren and slaters,'* said" the good
man from his pulpit the next Sunday,
"I have received a summons to another
parish. I have struggled and wrestled
in prayer, and It has been made clear
to me that it is the Lord who Is calling
me. I shall leave this little flock with
tears and regrets, but I cannot refuse
to heed His call."
Moral â Before you shy the rock
which I notice you have in your hand,
would it not be well to sit down and
have a little talk with yourself? Wnat
would you have done If you had been
in the clergyman's place? "Wouldn't
you have hung out a mighty alert ear
to catch the first intimation that the
Lord wanted you to accept that call?
And would not your otnen ear have
been somewhat afflicted with deafness?
Pastors are a good deal like the rest of
us, anyway. And how do you know
that the Lord did not really call the
good man? Anybody ought to sea that
He might have done so.
"Dear Brother "We are authorized
to inform you that the brethren and
sisters were pleased and benefited by
the highly spiritual sermon recently
preached by you before them, and are
unanimous in extending you a call to
act as their pastor. If you accept this
urgent call, the salary .will be $5000
per annum. While this would be double
the amount you are now receiving, wo
do not urge this fact as an argument
in favor of your acceptance, feeling
that you will do as the Lord may di
rect.

'""THE result of to-day's primary will settle the immediate fate and future of San
1 Francisco. If all of the citizens who desire that fate to be happy and that future
clean go to the polls and vote the Republican League ticket and then see that
others do the same, putting* in one day on guard, there can be no doubt of the result.
The enemies of good government, the friends and beneficiaries of graft and corrup
tion, have attempted to distract the situation and divert attention from themselves by
the pretense that the Eepublican League is merely, the hand of the Citizens' Alliance.
This pretense has been obviously overworked.
Taking it for what it-says and does, the Citizens' Alliance is not.in politics and
is not a political organization. It has no hope and can have none of controlling the
politics of San Francisco, and therefore* is without motive for doing politics at.all. It
lias no relation, by joint membership or otherwise, to the Eepublican League, for the
very sufficient reason that the Alliance is composed of men of all parties, while the
League is composed of Republicans onljv . '.
lire League, representing the majority party of this city, seeks to hold that ma
jority to one purpose, the conquering of good government for the city, believing that
to be the highest duty of a party that has in its membership a' majority of the voting
population, 'i
The city administration has spoken through its mouthpiece in the meeting of
Saturday night. The expression was of the "address-to-men-only" sort. It reminds one
of an incident in General Grant's tent, when an officer, bginning to tell an off-color
story, said/I believe there are no ladies present," and Grant said, "No, but I hope there
are gentlemen present." The story was not told. The, administration story was told
on Saturday night, for no one expressed the hope that there were gentlemen present.
When it was told, though it took two hours of words, it was all expressed in Tweed's
famous remark when his robbery was exposed, "What are you going to do about it'?"
The people of San Francisco know what they ought to do about it. They know
that they ought to go to the primary polls to-day and vot^ the League ticket and see
that others go and vote it. They know that ought to guard the ballot-box
against the uncon victed members of the gang of scoundrels who made the last pri
mary an exultant carnival of fraud, If. this duty is well done there will be a Repub
lican city convention, elected as a deliberative body, riot programmed in the interest
of individual ambitions, but inspired by a purpose that considers only the decencies of
government and the welfare of the city.
No one is in any doubt about the allies of the present administration. They are
found in the worst wing of the Democracy, and their mouthpiece is the Examiner.
His fellow-citizens and fellow- workingmen had suggested City Treasurer McDoaigald
as a man worthy to be considered as a nominee for Mayor. The Examiner, by attack
ing him, induced a letter from him in denial arid immediately used it to impeach his
spelling. The Examiner should be the last paper to insist that a prime qualification
for Mayor of San Francisco is that a man shall spell like a professor.
If spelling had been the test of qualification the late. Senator Hearst, father of
tile owner of the Examiner, would never have been United States Senator from Cali
fornia. JuVlged by that qualification, John MeDougald is as qualified for Mayor or for
Senator as he was. The incident is merely one of the straws showing the direction in
which the Examiner's political wind is blowing. If laboringmenwillconsider.it for
a moment, it means that they are outlawed for political preferment by the Examiner
unless their educational qualifications come up to the standard by which that paper
judges 3lr. MeDougald, and this is an exposure of the hollow pretense of Mr. William
Randolph HearstlS' great love for the laborer. We, say this without supporting Mr.
MeDougald or any one else for the nomination.'
The Call instigated the movement to regenerate the .government of San. Fran
cisco, and in urging that movement to success we promote a principle and not a per
sonality. It is for the Eepublican convention elected by the efforts of the Republican
League to say upon whom shall fall its choice for Mayor. That such selection will be
that of a citizen fit in all ways to represent this great city, and honestly manage its
affairs, we have no doubt. Nor do we 1 doubt that he will be supported in November by
a large majority of our voters. This is the first time for years that the people, the
majority, the taxpayers, have had a fair chance to control the nomination of a city ad
ministration.
The opportunity comes tli rough the energetic and self-sacrificing work of the Re
publican League. It is the first time that such an organization has entered the field
to secure a fair deal for everybody. Every member of the League has given" his best
work and thought to this gigantic effort. Its operations have been open and above
board. Its purpose was publicly declared and it has worked mightily to succeed. Its
efforts deserve the support not only qfi Ãepublicans, but of every citizen who aspires to
live in a morally clean city. If its ticket carries to-day it will present a city ticket
which all such citizens will be glad to support next November, and the history of an
administration so chosen will vindicate the authors of this movement and justify the
loyalty of all who support it.
Go to the polls to-day early. Vote the Republican League ticket and then put in
the day working for it.
In these respects Japan has imitated our example, has followed
in our footsteps, and has deserved our sentiments of friendship.
But there is no alliance with Japan and can be none on the part
of our Government. Xor will there be any with Russia or any
nation in Europe. The talk about an English alliance is empty.
It can go no further than a sympathetic community of feeling be
tween the people of the two countries. That is as far as any al
liance can go. It is sympathetic and not political.
THE appearance of the Russian peace envoys in this country
is made the occasion for the publishing in the St. Petersburg
Xovoe Vremya of an old argument, first put forward in 1859,
for an alliance between Russia and the United States. The paper
Â« which reproduces it now is the organ of the autocracy, so that the
publication is no doubt under imperial sanction.
It is no expression of unfriendliness to Russia to say that such
alliance is outside the policy of the United States. We made but
one experiment of that kind and that was enough. In 1778, before
our independence was achieved, we entered mto the French treaty
'of alliance. It was an alliance offensive and defensive, which be
came so offensive, in another sense, that we abrogated it in 1792,
after our independence and after we entered upon our constitu
tional existence. An alliance inevitably involves us in the interna
tional affairs of our ally, and involves our ally in our affairs of the
same nature.
Since the French treaty we have avoided alliances. Our policy
has been equality of relation to all nations. We cannot in safety
tie ourselves to one only, or to a group of nations. There is such
a thing as a moral alliance, a combination in one peaceful and pro
gressive purpose, in the interest of mankind. This is the recogni
tion by nations of the higher purposes of human government and
of the duty of promoting them. In this way we serve as an example
and recognize this principle in Russia, Great Britain, Japan and
every nation that makes it a guide of national action.
In the United States public sentiment is powerful. \u25a0 While the
Government, for proper reasons, remains neutral as between other
nations in controversy, public sentiment selects as "the favorite that
one whose policy nearest conforms to American ideals. This is the
reason why Japan has enjoyed the favor of American sentiment.
The institutions of Japan are popular. Government is parliamen
tary. The people vote. Education is free and general. In religion
there is freedom of conscience.

MISSOULA, Mont., Aug. 7.â Strike con
ditions on the Rocky Mountain division
are serious. It is true some trains are
running into division headquarters, but
others are from four to six hours late.
Wires, commercial and others, have been
broken during the last few days and Mis
soula has been practically isolated. Rush
business has been subjected by the West
ern Union, but flags have been working
on the railroad. Perishable freight has
been and is being refused by the North
ern Pacific. Yesterday the trainmen held
a meeting and decided they would accept
no more orders by telephone, as they feel
danger confronts them.
Superintendent Gibson says he has re
ceived no such communication from
trainmen, and his to Manager
Horn at St. Paul says everything Is mov
ing here. Fruit shipments are not being
accepted, and trains on the Bitter Root
and Coeur d'Alene branches are working
carefully. Division headquarters claim
that the strike is won, but Chairman
Kelly for the operators asks for a show
down on schedule of time demonstrated.
BILLINGS. Mont., Aug. 7.â The car
clerks working for the Northern Pacific
here quit to-day because Agent Hoyt
would not reinstate Samuel Foster, the
call boy. who was discharged for creating
a disturbance around the dispatchers' of
fice. The clerks claim their action has
nothing to do with the operators' strike.
General Superintendent Slade of the
Great Northern was equally emphatic in
declaring that there was no necessity for
arbitration. So far as could be noted lo
cally conditions on both of the roads
showed material improvement to-day.
Transcontinental passenger trains were
running nearer to schedule time than
they have done for several days, and
-both roads are receiving perishable
freight, although commission men say
they are shipping it only subject to delay.
President Perham said that he still be
lieves that Mr. Hill will take steps to
end the struggle as soon as he reaches
St. Paul. ' , ,
General Manager Horn of the Northern
Paclnc had heard nothing of such a prop
osition ar<l dtc-lared that there was no
occasion for arbitration.
"So far a/the Northern Pacific is con
cerned," said he. "there is nothing to ar
bitrate. Conditions are improving c-acn
day ami en some divisions are already
normal."
"The telegraphers," said Perham, "rfre
willing to submit their grievance to any
unbiased body of men, and would wel
come a propr sition to arbitrate coming
from this source."
BUTTE, Mont., Aug. 7.â Mystery sur
rounds the death of Joseph Whltford, a
special watchman employed by the North
ern Pacific during the recent strike, whose
mangled body was found on a streetcar
track beneath a viaduct two miles east
of hero this morning. Indications are
that ; Whltford mÂ«t with foul play. From
the appearance of the body it was avi
dent* that .Whitford. had been murdered
and his l.cdy placed upon the car track
to cover up the crime.
At many of the stations in Montana
where non-union .operators are employed
the company has placed armed guards to
protect the telegraphers from violence nt
the hands cf strikers. Three wrecks have
occurred on the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific near here during the
past two days. The railway officials
claim the accidents were due to spread
ing rails and broken flanges, but the
strikers asaert that the wrecks resulted
from poor telegraphic communications.
The strikers gained a distinct advantage
to-day when the railway conductors re
fused to accept any more train orders
given over the telephone.
ST. PAUL, Aug. 7.â Persistent rumors
were current to-day that a move had
been inaugurated" by the Northwestern
Farmers' Exchange and merchants' as
sociations along the line of the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific to secure
arbitration of the telegraphers' strike. So
far as could be ascertained no official,ac
tion in this direction has yet been taken.
â¢President Perham of the telegraphers
stated to the Associated Press that the
matter had not come before him officially,
alhough he had reports that such a move
ment was on foot.

Grovrr Cleveland Announces Pro
gramme of Meeting: to Be Held
A'ext September.
In the designing of the newly auth
orized ships, to be called the South
Carolina and Michigan, there has de
veloped the old difference of opinion
between the construction bureau and
the officers whose duty it will be to
fight the ships, when they are commis
sioned. .Half a dozen plans of battery
arrangement have been evolved. It Is
desired that the new battleships should
have a broadside fire of six or eight
guns. One arrangement provides for
four turrets, each enclosing two 12
inch gains. As a sort of compromise
some officers have suggested the adop
tion for these battleships of eleven-
Inch guns. This calibre is not now in
use In the United States Navy and the
objection Is made that to begin its
manufacture would be further to com
plicate the ordnance situation. It is
deemed now not Improbable that Sec
retary Bonaparte will be asked to re
quest Congress at the next session to
authorize. an increase of displacement
of the Michigan and South Carolina.
Upon consideration of this question
it quickly developed that a sixteen
thousand ton battleship could not carry
ten 12-Inch gun?. A~ burden of arma
ment consisting of a dozen guns of this
calibre is deemed out of the question
if as much space is given to engine in
stallation as is required by the best
opinion of the Bureau of Steam Engi
neering, and to the various auxili
aries now necessary In a modern man
of-war.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Aug. 7. â Although Con
gress authorized last March the con
struction of two battleships of 16,000
tons displacement, the Board on Con
struction of the Navy Department has
not yet been able to agree upon the
general characteristics of these ships.
The point at isstffe is the battery. Naval
strategists have been generally con
verted to the belief that the most ef
ficient gun fire is that obtainable from
a battleship armed with ten or twelve
inch guns, without any guns of inter
mediate calibre and having for a sec
ondary battery no guns larger than
five-inch, these to be used against tor
pedo craft.

Countess Lonyay was very unwise a
year ago when she suddenly, took her

with "Why did you lie to me?", and

When she married Count Lonyay it
wa3 clearly understood that the Em
peror would stop the big allowance
which she received as widowed Crown
Princess, and which amounted to nearly
one million crowns, this sum including
100,000 "crowns from her father. The
Emperor promised to give her 250,000
crowns every year, and she accepted,
thinking she could easily retrench, be
ing very much enamoured and possibly
dreaming of love in a., cottage/: She
never once thought that- as the widow
of the Crown Prince she lived entirely
at the Emperor's expense, whether In
the imperial palace In Vienna or at
Budapest, or at Castle Laxenburg or
MJramar, near Trieste. As many ser-:
vants, horses and carriages stood at her
disposition as she cared to appropriate
to her use. Her railway fares in the
country were paid by the Emperor and
a great many of the bills ? he* ran up
she sent to the Emperor's comptroller
for payment. '
Of course this made her allowance
much bigger than it really was. Very
soon after her marriage she found she
could not make both ends meet. She
had furious quarrels with her husband
before she, understood that the sums
lost at the gambling table must be paid
and her usual way out of all difficulties
was to send her young daughter to the
Emperor to beg for moneyl' But three
years ago Princess Elizabeth married
Prince Windisch-Graetz, a handsome
officer j In . the guards, with whom she
fell in love at a court ball and who did
not want to marry her, because he was
engaged to a Countess. Princess Eliza
beth's marriage. is not a very happy one
and the young wife often appeals to
the Emperor when her husband J falls
to comeup to her ideal. Since she is a
wife herself she \ has lost all patience
with her mother, who she thinks mar
ried when she was too old, and she no
longer pleads with the Emperor In her
behalf. , ;
her only ornament, this necklace ot
pearls.
The other Jewels consist of a set of
rubies, diadem, collar and brooch,
valued at $30,000, a large brooch of
pearls and diamonds at $20,000, an
other, all of diamonds, forming a lov
er's knot, at $12,000. a bracelet of dia
monds formed around one large . black
and one white pearl valued at $3000,
an emerald brooch at $SOOO and an
amethyst set, diadem, collar and
brooch, valued at $5000.
More interest, however, is centered in
her bridal veil, which is of great beauty
and worth at the lowest estimate $6000.
It is the finest work of the lace indus
try in Brussels and was a wedding gift
to the Crown Princess from the ladles
in Brussels. The veil is as long as the
full court train of the bridal robe with
which it was worn and took fifty lace
workers six months to complete. The
design was garlands of roses and lilies
of the valley, within which the arms of
Austria and Belgium were entwined.
With the veil came also a rich lace
flounce for the robe, but this the Coun
tess gave to her daughter, the Arch
duchess Elizabeth, when she was mar
ried to Prince Otto Windisch-Graetz.
Countess Lonyay must have known
that there was scarcely any act of hers
which would turn public opinion so
much against her as this demonstrative
rupture with her past life, and that the
aged Emperor, who Is exceedingly
sensitive on all points connected with
the memory of his unfortunate son,
would bitterly resent such a course and
find it hard to forgive her. This action
of hers proves that she has given up
all hope of getting any more money
from him, and that she is at her wits'
end to provide the funds for the keep
ing of her expensive husband, and also
to provide what she considers her own
necessities. Â«

LATOXIA SELECTIONS.
Coming Contest of Troops
.at the Presidio Will
Be Interesting. ,
The fact that the Supervisors will not
meet again until the second week in Sep
tember makes it doubtful if there will be
a boding permit Issued for that month. It
will be too late to wait until that date, so
the only chance for the promoters will
be to secure sufficient names to a petition
granting a permit.
The Western Athletic Club has had one
vote pledged to -.lt since the first of the
year. Its backers seem unable to add to
this small number, hence It is possible if
Morris Levy gets busy that he can land
the permit for next month for the Hayes
Valley Club.
Manager Jim Coffroth's offer of a $20,000
purse and a guarantee of $10,000 for the
picture privilege for a fifty-round fight
between Britt and Nelson will remain
open until Friday. If he secures the
match he will promote it on September 9
in the open air at Union Coursing Park,
just over the county line. Nelson has ac
cepted and it now remains for Britt to
say the word.
Jimmy Gardner and Buddy Ryan are to
meet this afternoon to sign for a match
at Colma. This seems . a peculiar move
on their part, as-Alex Greggains has of
fered them a match in this city, where
they would draw probably twice as much
as at Colma. Tbe Gardner-Turner fight
drew $5400, which is a record for Colma,
but a small gate here.
Grc-ggains is finding it difficult to get a
desirable match for this month.. He has
offered Jimroie Walsh of Boston a
match with Harry Tenny, but has had no
response. Walsh has lost but one fight in
five years. Greggains may have to fall
back on a programme of three fights be
tween George Peterson and Joe Thomas,
Herrera and Fred Landers and Dave
Barry and Hugo Kelly or Tommy* Burns:

The Balaklala mine's representative is
Grant Snyder, through whom the sale of
the property was recently effected, and
the fact that Snyder and Bernard Golin
sky are also here and staying at the Pal
ace* gives support to the story In circula
tion concerning the negotiations for the
townslte. The Balaklala mine Is situated
about eight miles from the town of Ken
nett, which is just north of the townsito
owned by Bernard Golinsky. It Ur gen
erally -supposed that the Mackay"-McCar
nlck syndicate is''trylngr to buy the town
site with a view "of erecting a 700-ton ca
pacity smelter upon it, and availing Itself
of Squaw. Creek, that runs through the
GollnsXy/ property. Young McCornick
and Engineer Brevort have had several
conferences with Bernard Golinsky and
his. brother, J. Gollnaky, during the past
few days regarding the deal. ' \u0084 , . \u0084

ported to be in connection with a deal,
now under way, for the purchase of the
Golirisky townsite/ln Shasta County, by
the owners of the Balakala Mining Com

BERKELEY, Aug. 7.â Two Dart
mouth men, skilled in the arts of foot
ball which have enabled Dartmouth to
lower the colors of such a great uni
versity as Harvard during the past two
years, are to coach the University of
California eleven this season. An
nouncement was made to-day that Dr.
J- F. Griffin, a Dartmouth man, is com
ing west to assist Coach Kuibbs in his
work on this coast. The two men left
Boston last Saturday and will arrive
here on Thursday.
Kzra Decoto, graduate manager of
athletics at the University of California,
will meet the two coaches and with
Trainer Walter Christie will introduce
them to the California players who are
to be under their direction for the re
main der of this year.
In securing: these Dartmouth cracks,
the University of California officials be
lieve they have the key that will open
the closed door maintained T>y Stan
ford on the gridiron for some time.
They reason thus: "Stanford ha.s been
taught by Lanagan and Reid the meth
ods of Harvard players. Dartmouth
has met Harvard and laid low the col
ors of the crimson aggregation from
Cambridge. If California is taught the
Dartmouth style of play, then Stan
ford's Harvardized system is likely to
be bumped."
Coach Knibbs. for California, was
captain of Dartmouth last year
w&en Dartmouth tied Harvard with a
nothing-nothing score, and defeated
every other team encountered: In that
yar Griffin assisted Folsom in coach
ing Dartmouth.
In JSO3 Griffin assisted Folsom in
coaching Dartmouth when Harvard
was beaten 11-0. and Brown was de
feated 62 to 0. Griffin also helped
coach in ISO 2, with McCormack. Grif
fin played on the Dartmouth team from
'3? to '01, filling the places of left half
and right tackle. \u25a0 He is a Boston man,
who is studying medicine at ths "Hub,"
End to will be known at the University
of California as Dr. â or "Doc" â Griffin.

PURE BLOOD
INSURES A CLEAR SKIN
' When Eczema, Acne, Tetter, Pimples,
or other skin diseases make their appear-
ance it is a sure sign that the blood is
filled with humors and burning acids.
These being forced through the pores
\u25a0end glands barn and blister the skin, pro-
ducing the eruptions which ar*Â» usually
- accompanied with intense itching, and
are disfiguring and humiliating.
Years affo my blood, was bad, as ovi-
- deuced by skin eruptions en. different
parts cf the body, and other symptoms,
co I concluded to try S. S. S., knowing it
to be highly spoken, of. After using a
number of bottlesâ do not remember now
just how much â my blood was thor-
wr ouirhly purified and enriched and I was
j relievedTof all eruptions and manifesta-
tions of impure blood. I be,] ieve.S. S. 8.
to be &n excellent blood medicine, and
any one in need cl such a medicine
\u25a0would do well to use it. They will find
it a perfect cure as it proved to bein my
c*Â»e. MBS. C. E. SHOEMAKER.
*â¢ : ; Alliance, 0., 616 E. Patterson St.
While external treatment relieves tem-
porarily it does not reach the real cause
of the disease, because it does not go into
'the blood. S. S. S., a perfect blood pu-
rifier, neutralizes thtse acids and humors,
and by strengthening and toning up the
Liver, Kidneys and Bowels, the natural
. channels of bodily waste, disposes of
them instead of
PURELY VEGETABLE, the greatest of
rM all tonics for
. building up the entire system, increasing
â¢' the appetite and helping the digestion.
S. S. S. cures all skin diseases promptly
and permanently, leaving the *kin soft
and smooth. Only by keeping the blood
w pure can we hope to have a clear skin.

While no important business in futures is re

of business could be done for early Octobei
shipment. So far as can be learned, however.
shippers en the coast are not willing to book
orders on k-ss than a 3^o f. o. b. basis on 60s

90k ar.d i^jc on SOs. Some have fixed their

Peaches retains the firm tone referred to in
previous reports as the dominating feature of
the market for that variety of fruit, but co far
as reported there is no very important busi
ness being done, buyers not being ready ap
parently to meet the higher views of sellers.
It Is reported that a considerable business in
Apricots for export has been done recently, but
at present the market is quiet, holders show
ing no disposition to make concessions to buy
t-rs. while the latter continue to hold nii foi |
.more favorable terms. California Raisins arÂ« ;

. Â«-a:ate<J that the receipts cf Mild Coffees during

the saesoa for trade activity sets in
"It is still a problem, what the 1905-6 Rio

circles the figure cf 11,000,000 bags Is the

New York Stock List.

Steel second ss. The movement of prices in

United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.
NEW YORK. Aug. 7. â An imposing Bhow of
strength resulted from to-day's trading m
stocks. A study of the list In detail reveal*
that the market was somewhat narrow and
restricted, in spite ot the general appearanc*
of strength. The inertia of a large proportion
of the standard railroad stocks was a striklTiÃ
feature of the market, which is only dull, how
ever, by considering what was \u25a0 not done in
trading a* well aÂ£ achieved. The closing of
the London Stock Exchange for a holiday, and
tha continued vacation absence of a large ele
ment of the Stock Exchange membership here,
are factors In the comparative dullness of the
market. But these qualifying considerations
do not obscure the fact that some very strik
ing advances were accomplished during the
day. The buying which caused these was con
centrated upon the specialties to a conspicuous
extent in the ssa c way that , the market of
last week was affected. The motives for the
demand were, however, to a large extent in
the general conditions. The news of the day
was pretty favorable in Its general tone, and
covered crop conditions and prospects, railroad
â¢arcings and traffic, demand tor anthradite,
large orders for all classes of steel products
and sustained ease In the money market. Re
ports were specific of the very large order*
being placed for iron ami steel products, eomr
of the mills refusing, as it was said, to con
sider new business except for Fhipment late m
the year, or next year, as they are already
overcrowded with v.tirk. The iron and steel
industrials gave evidence of organize support,
and moved as though a speculative party had
embarked in a campaign for higher prices.
The United States Steel stocks did not meet
the widest movements, but .had an important
sentimental influence on the general list. Rail
road traffic officials were quite unanimous In
reporting a volume of traffic which was fast
absorbing the gTeatly expanded equipment fa
cilities which have been added by all the great
railroad systems in the last few months. Grain
has commenced to move freely, except for
some backwardness In the corn movement, and
orders for all grades of merchandise are re<
ported to be on a large scale, based on the
growing confidence In the crop out-turns. The
grangers were relatively backward, owing to
the comparatively small movement of" the
grain and the critical period yet to be passed
for Its maturity. The action of the market
was due in no small part, however, to the ma
turing of the conviction that the country's
grain crops are practically assured and that
they will prove large. Thp Southern rallroaat
enjoyed another advance in concert, without
regard to the poorer outlook for cotton. Satur
day's unfavorable bank statement was the
subject of some discussion, but the sustained

SEVERAL OLD LAWSUITS
Short of stature, rotund of form and
heavily bearded, George Shoemaker em

averred, he visited : several . workshops in

Ah Him, the aged Chinaman who imag
ines he owns the Hall of Justice and
Portsmouth square, received his semi
annual six months' sentence, 'Judge Con
lan pronouncing it. Ah Him was released
from a half-year's term . of imprisonment
last Friday, and on Saturday he was ar
rested for vociferously complaining of
the way in which his fancied property
had teen cared for during his Incarcera
tion. '
So unmistakably drunk was Joseph
Wood when he declared himself guilty of
burglary that Judge Fritz declined to ac
cept the plea and sent him away to un
dergo a sobering process in the cells.
Mr. Wood was arrested on complaint of
John Iffi-nna, a bartender at "Dickey's,"
ne>? the park, who testified that at an
nearly hour last Sunday morning the de
fendant entered the saloon and rifled the
cash register, getting away with $43. Pa
trolmen Kessing^and O'Shea found Mr.
Wood asleep In an abandoned street car,
and so drunk was he that the effects of
the liquor had not left him when' he was
arraigned about thirty liours afterward.
"I'm an attorney 'and -I know some
law," he said to Judge Fritz. ." :â¢
"If you epeak the truth you're an ex
ceptional pleader In this court," dryly re
sponded his Honor, glancing at the attor
neys' table. : - "\,
But !t developed that Mr. Wood was not
of the legal profession, his vocation being
that of "touter" for a wayside inn.
John A.Â« Logan Bell, who shot and
killed his stepfather, Joseph Bartlett,
last Sunday morning at 422% Fulton
street, was arraigned b6f ore Judge
Conlan and had his examination con
tinued for a week. The defendant's
drunkenness had entirely disappeared
when he faced the court, and his facial
expression indicated full appreciation
of the seriousness of his position.
But the rush had' not, decreased nor
had the impatience of the waiting pa
trons abated, so the 'master barber re
pressed his inclination to dismiss Mr.
Fine right there and then, said repres
sion being bolstered by a hope that
the act of shaving might have a sober
ing influence upon the operator. And
two more bleeding and blaspheming
victims were released from Mr. Fine's
clutches ere he was notified that his
services were no longer desired, as it
was a barber, not a butcher, that his
employer had intended to hire. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.-.
Then the trouble waxed warm. Mr.
Fine resented the imputation cast upon
his professional worth by smiting its
author, for which he was arrested and
booked for peace disturbance. Police
Judge Conlan pronounced him guilty
and reserved sentence.
Mr. Fine's summons to the chair soon
discovered that' he was in unsteady
hands, for the lather scraped. from his
face was of sanguinary hue and several
smarting cuts informed him . that he
was being carved. He prudently said
nothing until he was released, and then
he inspected the . reflection of his
wounds In mirror,.- swore volubly
and with emphasis, paid for the surgi
cal operation and j informed the pro
prietor that never again would he
darken the door of such a slaughter
house. Whereupon the proprietor
glanced sharply at Mr. Fine and saw
unmistakable symptoms of intoxica-,
tion.
William -E. Spann of "Paducah, Ky.,
has filed a sensational complaint in the
Superior Court in which he sues for a
divorce from his young and beautiful
wife, Laura.' The complaint states .that
Laura Petter \u25a0 is * the { girl-wife's real
name and 1 that the -name of- Spann is
an alias and not legally that of the
defendant.
Soann ' alleges that on the 15th of
November, 1904, he was forcibly con
tracted |to Laura Petter under the
loaded revolvers of the girl's father and
brother at Paducah, Ky. He . fails,
however, to 'mention^Jn his complaint
why 'such a display of force was used
to bring about his marriage.
Miss Tetter and the plaintiff appear
ed before a Justice of the Peace in the
Kentucky city and were duly married
according to the form prescribed by the
statutes. Spann alleges, however, that
the Justice was in the conspiracy and
prays that the marriage be dissolved.

It was on Fifth avenue, .. South ' \u25a0\u25a0â San

Mr. Shoemaker's plea seemed I plausible
enough until Judge Conlan began- to. in
terrogate him as to the whereabouts " of
the alleged wagon, when the ."entire de
fensive structure crumbled like a. house
of cards in -collapse. It was- ascertained
that the defendant did not own a wagon
and did not have charge .of' a 'wagon for

guilty of petty larceny and to-morrow he

With neatness and dispatch Mr. Fine
ecraped the stubble from two chins
and then asked his employer for a loan
of 80 cents wherewith ' to purchase
food, as he had neglected to partake
of supper at his boarding-house. The
money was handed to him, accompanied
with a request that he devote no more
time to eating than was essential to
full gastronomic repletion, as all the
chairs were occupied and several gen
tlemen anxiously awaited summons to
fill a vacancy.
Half an hour later Mr. Fine returned
and resumed his labor, and an hour
and a half still later he requested an
other loan of f 1 60 with which to pur-
Chase some household necessaries be
fore the stores closed. Again he was
given the desired amount, again he was
urged to expedite his shopping and
again he reappeared at the expiration
of half an hour and cheerily shouted,
"Next!"

was sober as the proverbial judge, and
as the usual Saturday evening rush
was in full blast, and he submitted
certificates of Journeymanship and

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
It may go hard with a man. supposed
to be a detective, who went around to
students and represented that'he was em
ployed by the commission to gather evi
dence. Many 'students have sworn to the
tact that this man, who gave his name
as Tucker, approached them as though
he represented Governor Pardee and the
commission. He is said to have asked
cue student whether he thought the
"crooked five" or the "crooked two" were
guilty.
Dr. A- B. Cosad of Oakland testified
that Dr. Brasch had told him that he had
been saving up to get a license, and that
afterward a cousin of Dr. Brasch, one
Shingles, had told him that he knew one
man who had bought a license from the
Loard.
Dr. J. A. Brooks said he had overheard
the conversation between Dr. Dunn and
hiV assistant. Dr. Papandre, and that
they were merely talking over general
questions. He said that the former testi
mony of Drs. Minor and O'Connell was
"most odious and disgusting." He also
volunteered the Information that he
thought that the whole investigation was
"itn unnecessary waste of time."
Lawyers, witnesses and commission
made merry many times during yester
day's session. Caustic wit passed to and
fro. Several young graduates took the
opportunity of expressing their rage at
the holding back of the list of those who
bad passed the State examinations. The
session will resume at 9 o'clock this
morning.
Another dentist** supply man was dis
covered yesterday as one who had exclu-
Bive information. He is alleged to have
told two students that he would go to
Palo Alto and find out whether they had
passed. This was aimed at Dr. Mayhew.
Very little Important testimony wao
brought out yesterday by the Governor*"
commission which is investigating the el
ieged irregularities in the actions ot the
State Dental Board. All of the young
graduates have now given their testi
mony and have been dismissed. The sup
posed giving out of the questions before
the anatomy examination by a member
of the board Is yet to be conclusively
proved.
It is evident that Dr. Dunn talked -to
his assistant, Dr. Papandre, twice in the
hallway of the examination building be
fore the test was given, but it is far from
determined that he gave out any llle-
Sitiniate Information. No proof whatso
ever has been offered to show that these
questions were'^glven out In advance by
Dr. Mayhew, unless, ot course, he gave
them to Dr. Howard for the use of his
cuiz class. But there has been nothing
to denote this state of affairs.
The commission is highly interested in
Dr. Coke, a member of a Market street
dental firm. This man has been the
friend of thÂ« students of both colleges,
end hÂ» has told most of them whether
they have passed the State examinations.
He first aeked them their number, told
them to call a few days later and then
Informed them as to their chances of ob
taining the coveted license from the
board. The commission is anxious to
know whether this man has a direct leak
from some member of the board and
thus gains his information or whether he
is merely a shrewd guesser and hood
winks the students. If he has his infor
mation direct from the board the com
mission wants to know it. It is probable
that Dr. Coke will be subpenaed to tes
tify.
After six' years of disagreement be
tween the raisin growers and raisin
packers of California, a step was taken
yesterday that bids fair to increase the

house and .water. They send thousands of
dollars - home every month -for the war.

and satisfied . and their children. In the public

With the exception of the overseers no white
people work on the "plantations.
White wage earners. In and about Honolulu
are being supplanted by the Japanese, who do

"Hawaii. Its Natural, Secular and Re

Dr. F. D. Bovard took the attitude that
higher criticism has spent its forceâ that
the poition of \u25a0 scholars' of "the present
day was at least suspended judgment. He
declared' that the integrity of the history
of the ' Jews remained intact and that no
theory of the higher critic had attempted
to explain the history of the Jews in an
essentially different manner from that
set forth in the Scriptures.
'Dr.Bovard held 'that the'preclse tem
perament'of the Jewish people to-day
corresponded with that -described- in' the
Scriptures, and that' the validity of the
history'of; the Jews" was unshaken by at
tacks of the higher critics. '_".. ..
At the close of the address there was
a general and eager desire to respond.
JEWISH HISTORY INTACT.
' The prophets are an aggregation of frag
ments, : with the exception of Daniel and
Ezekiel. Probably j none of the Psalms was
written by David. Solomon knew nothing of
Proverbs orEcclesiastes.
It is not placing â¢it too strong to say that
higher criticism- has revolutionized theology,
doctrines and creeds during the last twenty
five years and that thg next twenty-five
years will show a greater revolution. Its con
structive work has Just. begun,
j It is very probable that many of our beliefs
concerning the '.Bible 'will be entirely .done
away with during the next generation.
\u25a0 ' I - do . not . believe that â¢ higher criticism ha?
in any way disturbed the fundamentals of
doctrine. Some readjustment will be necos T
sary and then the Christian church will be In
a far better position to teach and preach the
gospel. We should welcome everything that
tends to give. us th* true.wprd of God. /
The books of. the Bible are biographical and
historical rather than theological. Many tra
ditions and fetters have been destroyed that
never had a basis in the Bible.
The Pentateuch does not claim In Itself to
be- the work of Moses, and the books of the
Bible i were . not In their present form until
after, the exile. â¢ -â¢â¢.-. \u25a0_; â¢ â¢â¢- \u25a0 â¢
BIBLE HISTORICAL.
.The higher critic holds that some of the
books of .the Bible are of a composite nature;
that dates of composition cannot be .settled
with present data; that all parts of the Bible
are not infallible; that conditions and methods
of Inspiration enter Into thÂ« problem; that
there Is no internal . evidence that- all â¢ the
Bibl* is inspired or that the writera believe
that they were Inspired. .-" . â¢
Inspiration doe? not. preserve, the writer from
mistakes in history.' grammar , and â¢ science, or
in any way interfere with his' personal 'char
acteristics. '.*' -' > ; - . . : ...... \u25a0 . ...
The destructive and atheistic higher critic
has done some harm, but the conscientious
and reverent Jilgher criticâ and this is the only
kind we have to. do with â is constructive, seek
ing: ever after the original word of God.
The evangelist attacks leave .the Impression
that- all critics are destructive.
Hie entire history of .the church has 6hown
that" the Bible critic or Echolar haa had mpre
to do with the revivals and progressive move
ments of â¢ tho church than the evangelist. All
great revivals of, religion hinge upon the work
of j the scholar who has investigated and
brought forth the great truths of the Bible.
The attacks of the evangelist upon the critic
and his work are uncalled for and unwise.
\u25a0Much excitement was occasioned at the
Methodist ministers', meeting . yesterday
morning at the Central Methodist Epis
copal Church, on Mission street, over an
address by the Rev. E. D. Kaley on "The
Critic and the Evangelist."-
The attendance was large. Mr. Raley,
who is deemed one of the most promising
of the young ministers of his denomina
tion and is pastor of Richmond Metho
dist Church, said: ' . \u25a0 ,
The critic and' the evangelist are not ene
mies, but co-laborers. The evangelist has as
sumed an oppostlon to the critic; he has been
attacking his best friend.

Copious Tears Over Body
of Her Murdered Husband
BEGS FOE FORGIVENESS
Nicholas Prater, Rancher's
Employer, Declares That. a
Better Man Never Lived
"Speak to me, Will; flay that you, for
give me, Will," cobbed Mrs. Lucy F.-Ste
phenson as she flung herself across the
body of her murdered husband in an un
dertaker's parlor on ...Van Ness avenue
yesterday. For the firs^time since her
husband fell dead at her feet In a room
at 1015^ Larkin street on Saturday morn
ing she gave way to a flood of tears as
she saw his dead body yesterday.
. She kissed his forehead and . patted his
cold cheeks with her hands as she. wailed
her cry for forgiveness. Sergeant'Tobin,
prison-keeper, who had accompanied her,
left her alone in her j grief. He had to
support her as they left the parlors. She
had/been taken to view the [ body, : as it
was to; be shipped to Reno last night.. \u25a0'.-.\u25a0
Prior to this scene the woman had to
undergo another ordeal. Nicholas Prater,
vk'ho owns the ranch where the murdered
man worked in Washoe, Nev., called at
the City Prison yesterday to-sec her. : She
embraced .him and they had an hour's
private conversation in the prison-keep
er's room. Prater later said that he had
ch'Jded . her. for saying that her husband
had treated, her cruelly.' and she had de^
nled to him that she had said bo. ',7: '
"Stephenson worked on my ranch for
eight or. nine years," said Prater, "and a
better man never- lived. He was always
kind' and * considerate to * his wife and
family, and I wae surprised when I read
in the papers that she had charged him
with' treating her cruelly. It is a lle> v I
advanced him the $500 to enable him to
send -his wife to this city for the opera
tion performed .upon her, as they did not
have a cent of their own. If it had. not
been- for .my 'money I guesa poor ; Ste
phenson would have been alive to-day. I
don't : know much about Bowen. He came
around there last December. I intend to
stay here.to see that justice is done to
Stephenson's murderer. I am taking care
of the four young children, but God only
knows what will become of them."
Mrs. Stephenson was booked at the City
Prison yesterday afternoon as a witness
and her bail was fixed at $500 cash. In a
few. minutes the money was put up by
Attorney Walter Gallagher and she was
released.
Yesterday morning ChilHon Bowen was
instructed and arraigned in Police Judge
Fritz's court on a charge of murder and
the case was continued till Friday. At
torney Gallagher charged in open court
that "funny" things were going on in the
City Prison and that efforts had been
made to take the case out of his hands.
The prison officials give the charge an
emphatic , denial. DetecfTves Matheson
and '.Mulcahy found among Bowen's ef
fects yesterday a dirk, showing that he
had amply prepared himself I for contin
gencies.'-.-'_'"* : '
