ALAMEDA COMES TO PORT FROM FAR HONOLULU WITH REMAINS OF MRS. STANFORD
Detectives Will Soon Be Able to Clear Away the Thick Veil of Mystery
Solution of Poland Water
Mystery Is Near.
TWO ARE UNDER SUSPICION
Motive for Crime Is Still
a Puzzling Factor. .
EVIDENCE IS ACCUMULATING
It was announced at police headquarters last evening that
within the next forty-eight hours the mystery surrounding the
presence of strychnine poison in the bottle of Poland water, with
which Mrs. Stanford quenched her thirst on the evening of Jan
uary 14 at her California-street home, will have been completely
solved, and that p ,.*ssibly one of two persons toward whom the
strongest suspicion is directed will be arrested.
As to whether the poison was placed in the bottle before the
water was drunk by Mrs. Stanford, for the purpose of ending the
generous woman's life, or surreptitiously injected into the bottle
after she had drunk from it. with malicious intent toward Miss
Berner, are questions that Captain of Detectives Burnett last
â¢ refused to answer.
The discover}' of a bottle of strychnine poison in the Stan
home, as originally published in The Call and later confirmed
aptain Burnett, figures in the latest developments in the case.
I was said last night that the detectives have not yet been
able to fully determine how this bottle came into the house or by
whom it was purchased. It is these important details that are
being sifted by the police with a view to making disclosures
that have long been impatiently awaited by the public.
Yesterday afternoon Captain [ Jules
Callundan of Morse's agency and De
tective Harry Reynolds of the regular
force, on returning from Palo Alto,
whither they went as escort to Miss
BÂ«rrn*r, were closeted- wiffi ; Acting
Chief of Police Spillane and Captain
Burnett for an hour and a half. Dur
ing the conference the first mentioned
two made a verbal report of the result
of their investigations in Honolulu. It
was a synopsis of a written report that
will be prepared to-day and submitted
to Attorney Mountford "Wilson". In
this report the detectives will furnish
Attorney "Wilson and Captain Burnett
with an interesting account of Mrs.
Stanford's death, which is greatly at
variance with the evidence adduced at
the inquest in Honolulu, although it is
founded on the testimony of the very
same witnesses at that formal hear
â¦ ing.
In the report the detectives make
Dr. Humphris contradicts himself on
points so material in the determining
I of the cause of Mrs. Stanford's death
that it is hard for the detectives to ar
rive at the conclusion that a murder
â was committed. Briefly their find
ings, which are concurred in by Presi
dent Jordan, who was present at the
examination of witnesses after the in
quest, are to the effect that an over
loaded stomach; a weak heart, excited
by overindulgence in exercise attend
ing the aged woman's outing on the
day of her death, and the use of cas
cara with strychnine, improperly pre
pared, combined to bring about her
d^ath. In his original testimony be
fore the Coroners jury Dr. Humphris
described Mrs. Stanford's symptoms at
the period of death as positive indica
tions of strychnine poisoning. He told
of her terrible convulsions and the
rigidity following her death.
DIED LX CHAIR.
When the detectives arrived in Hon
o.ulu and proceeded with a second in
. nation, a careful questioning of
the doctor developed the fact that in-
Ftead of dying in her bed, as he had
.ously asserted. Mrs. Stanford had
actually died in a chair. Considerable
importance is attached to this proved
fact, for it strongly tends to dispel the
theory that she died, from strychnine
poisoning, for had such been the case,
the convulsions that invariably attend
the dying moments of a victim of
hnine poisoning are sc severe that
it would be impossible to ren hold a
nt on a chair. >

doctors ability to clearly diagnose a
case of strychnine poisoning.
It is shown by the evidence gath
ered by Cailundan and Reynolds and
attentively listened to by Dr. Jordan,
JJiaJL3lrs. Stanford's death was attend
ee! by only the ordinary rigidity of a
death from natural causes, and that
immediately after she had passed
away she was removed from the chair
to her bed, where little difficulty was
experienced in straightening out her
lifeless form, a task that could not
have been accomplished had strychnine
poisoning alone caused her death.
Â«'aptain Burnett was furnished
another strong point against the
Coroner's verdict of strychnine poison
ing in these two facts: First, that the
bottle of bicarbonate of soda, from
which Mrs. Stanford took a potion,
contained in all 662 grains of soda,
which, when analyzed was found to
contain only 48 hundredths of a grain
of strychnine, which, proportionately,
was only 1 -1326 th of the total contents
of the bottle.
Second, the cascara capsules, of
which Mrs. Stanford took one. contained
one-thirteenth of a grain of strychnine,
which the chemists declare combined
with the strychnine in the soda, might
have produced death in a person of
Mrs. Stanford's age and at a time when
her system was upset by over-eating
and unusual exercise, such as she in
dulged in on the day of her death.
OTHER STRONG FACTS.
In further rebuttal of the original
testimony given by Dr. Humphris, Cal
lundan and Reynolds gave Captain
Burnett absolute proof of the fact that
Mrs. .Stanford could not have possibiv
fallen to the floor alter taking her
medicine, even if it did not contain poi
son, and regain her fee^t without as
sistance. To substantiate this asser
tion the detectives produced state
ments of Mrs. Stanford's physicians,
and of Miss Berner and Miss Hunt,
to the effect that for more than a
year Mrs. Stanford had suffered from
stiffness of the knees, and had found
it beyond her physical ability to rise
froni the floor alone.
Although the physicians who con
ducted the autopsy made the state
ment that Mrs. Stanford's organs were
in a remarkably healthy condition for
a woman of her age, the detectives
gleaned from Inquiry among several
prominent surgeons who examined the
heart that the latter discovered that it
was anything bu^ healthy. It was
found to contain portions of fat that
had not been examined by the autopsy
surgeons, and bore other noticeable in
dications of disease. Another surpris
ing discovery made by the detectives,
and one that should have entered into
the considerations of the autopsy sur
geons, was the amount of food con
sumed by Mrs. Stanford at the picnic.
On that occasion she ate four Swiss
cheese sandwiches, two â  tongue sand
wiches, two lettuce sandwiches, two or
three large pieces of ginger bread, of
which she was very fond; two cups
of cold coffee, which she had prepared
herself before she left the Moano Hotel;
also some fruit, and twelve or fourteen
pieces of French candy, which she
later complained made her slightly
sick at her stomach. It destroyed her
appetite for the evening meal.
STOMACH HURTS HEART.
The crowding of her stomach, after
considerable walking, naturally weak
ened her heart and might easily have
hastened the end of a woman of Mrs.
Stanford's advanced age, so experts
contend. These facts, revealed by the
persistent inquiry of Captain Callun
dan, readily appealed to Resident Jor
dan and were responsible for his con
clusions that Mrs. Stanford was not
poisoned. He has so advised Attorney
Mountford Wilson in a report prepared
during the return voyage to this city.
The document was handed to the at
torney yesterday afternoon by Dr. Jor
dan and was later brought to this city.
Although Attorney Wilson refused
to make the report public last night.

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22. 1905.
JORDAN REASSERTS HIS OPINION THAT
DEATH RESULTED FROM NATURAL CAUSES
Makes Severe Comment on
Those in Honolulu Con
ducting Investigation.
"Mr. Hopkins and I stand by the
statement we gave out just before we
left Honolulu," asserted President
David Starr Jordan when approached
by representatives of the press immedi
ately after the Alameda had been tied
at the Oceanic dock.
The president was emphatic in reiter
ating his opinion there was no question
that Mrs. Stanford died from natural
causes.
"Yes, I have just seen the statement
issued by Chemist Shorey and the doc
tors wherein they seek to refute our
version as to the cause of death and
set forth an argument in favor of the
poisoning theory," the president an
swered. "But," he continued, "I don't
care how many doctors or chemists in
Honolulu make statements, or how
many statements they issue. We can't
help what public opinion may be. You
may say that we are absolutely con
vinced that strychnine did not bring
about the death of Mrs. Stanford and
that we know whereof we speak when
we declare that her death was due to
natural causes."
"Are Detectives Callundan and Rey
nolds likewise convinced beyond all
question that Mrs. Stanford was not
poisoned in Honolulu?"
"Yes. they agree with us. We con
sulted with them, of course, before we
issued that statement in Honolulu. We
would not have given It out unless De
tectives Reynolds and Callundan
agreed with us."
QUESTION TOO POINTED.
"How do you account for the presence
of the half grain of strychnine found in
the bicarbonate of soda of which Mrs.
Stanford partook before she retired?"
"That is a leading question," came
the answer archly, and President Jor
dan turned half around, indicating that
he was averse to saying anything fur
ther on this point.
The courteous president then turned
to his interviewers again with an ex
planation that he was not at liberty to
enter into any detailed discussion of the
case. He said he had made a full re
port in writing for the use of Attorney
Mountford Wilson, and the attorney
must be looked to for further infor
mation, was added.
"We appreciate your position in this
matter, but the world is left in doubt
by the two diametrically opposite state
ments, that of yourself and Mr. Hop
kins declaring death resulted from
natural causes and the statement in
reply by Chemist Shorey and the Hono
lulu doctors reasserting that strychnine
poisoning was the cause of death. The
public is somewhat in the dark as to
which statement it shall accept. Are
we to understand that you discredit
the chemist, the doctors and the Hono
lulu officials?"
Then President Jordan made a re
mark of startling import. His man
ner was of as much significance as his
words.
"I know all about them and their
work," said President Jordan.
It may be inferred safely within the
bounds of careful interpretation that
President Jordan meant to convey the
conviction in his mind that not all the
doctors and chemists and officials con
nected with the investigation in Hono
lulu are at least trustworthy.
â¢'Do you mean to say that there was
a conspiracy or an effort on the part
of any one to make it appear that Mrs.
Stanford was poisoned, when as a mat
ter of fact they knew there was no
evidence to support Ruch a theory?"
Dr. Jordan made, no reply. The in
terviewer persisted:
"Are we to believe that some one
mixed the strychnine crystals in the
bicarbonate of soda after Mrs. Stan
ford took the dose from the bottle in
order to make it appear that she had
been poisoned?"
But the president was through with
interviewing along this line and he

OPINION DIVIDED AMONG PEOPLE
OF HONOLULU REGARDING DEATH
Officials and Doctors Support the Verdict, but
Public Criticizes Freely.
HONOLULU, March 15. â Opinions
differ widely here as to the death of
Mrs. Stanford. If Honolulu were to
decide by vote how Mrs. Stanford met
death so suddenly the overwhelming
majority would probably be in favor
of the theory of natural causes. Her
advanced age and the attack of indi
gestion are taken much into account.
But the autopsy surgeons and the
attending physicians are solidly op
posed to this theory, for it fails utter
ly to account for the presence of
strychnine, no matter in how small a
quantity, in the bottle of bicarbonate
of soda. High Sheriff Henry and Dep
uty Uawlins are tirm adherents of the
murder theory, as formally prormil
jritttu by the Coroner's jury in the
case.

work as the investigation of a mys

force.
There is reason to believe that De
tectives Iteynolds and Callundan were
surprised at the neglect of some line*
of investigation by the local police
and the final reports of the dete.
will, it is reported, cast considerable
discredit on the work the Honolulu

MISS |',KKM PARTOOK OF SODA
"Is it i rue that Miss, Berner partook
of the bicarbonate of soda the same
evening Iklrs. Stanford did, as you set
forth in the â  cablegram you ordered
â withheld just before your departure
from Honolulu?"
"Yes. Miss Berner did take a dose
of bicarbonate from that very same
bottle. She took half the quantity Mrs.
Stanford ~dia\ ' Miss" Berner "felt no ill
effects whatever, she says. She de
tected no bitter taste and there could
have been no poison in the soda then.'
. The president said Miss Berner look
her dose of bicarbonate a short time
before Mrs. Stanford measured out half
a tablespoonful. It appeared to be
clear to Jordan's mind that the fact
that there was no strychnine In the
.bicarbonate the secretary drank was
proof conclusive that the soda was free
of crystals when Mrs. Stanford took
her potion shortly prior to death.
- NO LIGHT ON OTHER CASE.
. If you have reached the conclusion
that there was no poisoning at Hono
lulu, what is your opinion as to the
attempted poisoning in San Francisco
on January 14?" â 
"When I left San Francisco for Hon
olulu I had my mind made up from
the information given out by the Ha
waiian officials as conveyed in the
press cablegrams that the same per
son or persons who had tried to poison
her at the Noli Hill mansion were re
sponsible for her death in Honolulu.
But you "can read between the lines
of the statement Mr. Hopkins and I
issued that we wanted to make it clear
that there was no connection between
the San Francisco case and the death
pf Mrs. Stanford. In other words, the
result of our investigations in Hono
lulu did not throw any light on the
mystery in this city one way or the
other. As to ' how Mr*. Stanford was
poisoned in San Francisco when she
drank tin Poland water in which
Bsiycbnlne was found I have no theory
whatever "

KNOWN WHEREOF HE SPEAKS.

President Jordan, made a fuller expla
nation of why his lips must remain
sealed in connection with the case. He
reiterated that it was his r.'ai â â¢â  i"

â who lias charge of all the investiga

duty was ended. Urn he was not at

the man to decide what was proper to
divulge and what to withhold. The
lent again declared that the state
ment h*- and Mr Honkins made just
before leaving Honolulu was prepared
with the utmost care by them, only
after most thoughtful deliberation,
weighing of evidence and consultation
In every detail with Detectives Callun

"The public may rest assured that we
knew what wo were talking about in
that statement," was the parting as
surance President Jordan gave, and it
vas plain that he had full confidence
in the conclusion that- Mrs. Stanford
died from natural causes and could say
come ugly things about those who par
ticipated in the investigation conduct
ed by the Honolulu authorities, were
he free to do so. ; -Â . _
Timothy Hopkins refused absolutely
to be interviewed. He referred thÂ«?
newspaper men to Dr. Jordan, whom
he designated as the spokesman.
Both the president and ' the trustee
of the university appeared in the best
of health, and said that other than the
sadness of their mission there had been
no untoward feature of the voyage to
the islands and return. They found
pome gratification in the fact that Mrs.
Sanford's life had not been taken by a
foul murderer's hand. Both Jordan

Through the courtesy of Collector
Stratton of this port the Government
bay steamer Golden Gate was placed
at the disposal of the Stanford repre

out to the Alameda to go aboard as
soon as the steamship passed quaran

them Charles Lathrop. his wife and
his daughter, Jennie Lathrop. did not
take advantage of the offer, however,
but awaited the Alameda at the pier.

The hearse la which Mrs. Stanford's

Alameda arrived and it had to be sum

was accordingly a painty I delay of
half an hour after all preparations had
been made for taking the casket
ashore from the hold of the steamship.
Uncertainty as to the hour of the ves
sel's arrival was responsible for the
miscarriage of the undertaker's plans.
After the arrival of the hearse there
was a ouestion whether it was long
enough to contain the large coffin. The
undertaker first took a measure of the
hearse and then of the coffin, but for
tunately there was just room enough
and the fears of another unfortunate
delay were not realized. The coffin
fitted so closely into the hearse that

The trip across from Honolulu was
very pleasant, and both Miss Berner
and Miss Hunt were not troubled to
any extent with seasickness. They
came to nearly all their meals and
spent a great deal of time on deck.
They were naturally more or less cast
down by the terrible; experience they
had been through, but both appeared
exceedingly brave and tried to be as
cheerful as they could under the cir
cumstances. They did not attempt to
keep especially aloof from the passen
gers on board and conversed pleasantly
with any who addressed them. They,
however, when they were on deck,
spent practically all their, time in com
pany with David Starr Jordan and
Timothy Hopkins. They were both
dressed very plainly in black during the
voyage,. Miss Berner being in partial
mourning with short black veil. Miss
Hunt wore a simple garb of black,
with black hat, but no- mourning veil.
They both looked very pale, tired and
thoroughly worn out when they landed
at the dock. During the voyage the
union jack on the vessel floated at
half mast.
The remains of Mrs. Stanford reposed
in a specially constructed compartment
in the forward hold. It was about ten
feet square and seven feet deep. It
was hung in heavy black and draped
about the sides with deep purple silk.
On one side was a small cluster of
electric lights and an electric fan was
at one end. Resting on a dais at one
side was the coffin, strapped to the
side of the vessel. The remains were
encased in a metalic octagonal coffin,
the top of which was covered by a mass
of 10-vely floral offerings, sent by the of
ficials of Honolulu. The coffin was in
turn enclosed in a heavy walnut case,
c-ver which was thrown a pall of black.
A guard was in attendance day and
night, while a special guard paid
hourly visits to see that everything was
in order. During the voyage up David
Starr Jordan paid one visit to the rest
ing place of Mrs. Stanford, and
Timothy Hopkins paid one. Burrounding
the cc-mn were magnificent flowers, sent
by friends in Honolulu. One floral piece
was six feet high and represented an
urn. It was wrought in the choicest
flowers of the southern clime.
CONDUCT OF CORONER'S
/ JURY IS CRITICIZED
Continued From Page I, Column 6.
Henry has worked alone with Raw
lins.
'Jhe composition of the Coroner's jury j
is also a subject of criticism. Its six j
members included the manager, part- !
ncr, proprietor, two employes and a I
guest of the Moana Hotel, where the ;
| tragedy occurred. They are men of |
I high standing, but it is said that prac-
I tically all of them should have been
\\ itnesaes in the case, instead of jur- ;
i ors.
INQI'KST CRITICIZED.
The conduct of the inquest is also
strongly criticized. There was no close
e>amination of witnesses. Deputy
Sheriff Rawlins and those whom he j
called appeared more as if they were i
rehearsing well-learned parts than as I
if making important investigations.
The witnesses seemed to be kept with- |
in the bounds of a preconceived the
ory of the case and when the evidence j
was in both the Sheriff and deputy |
remained in consultation with the jur- j
or?. A â¢ verdict was written out dui>
ing this consultation. Most spectators
j and press representatives retired while
! this was being done.
Returning in a few minutes they
found the Sheriff and deputy Just with- j
drawing from the Juryroom. The door !
was closed and in two minutes the six !
men signed the verdict and returned j
it. declaring that murder had beer. :
done. The verdio-r thus arrived at Is
-regarded with little respect in Hono
lulu. , ' j
On the part of the police- there is a
disposition to regard Detectives Hey-
I nolds and Callundan in the light of
special counsel. The idea is that they
came here for the purpose of trying jto
- prove -a -natural death; for the sake" of '
the good name of the deceased, and j
that therefore they may be expected '
to criticize the Honolulu police work I
and the jury's verdict. - ' 'â 
JORDAN'S WISH.
Dr. Jordan ha% from the first openly I
stated his hope and wish that the in- '
vestigation might result in proving .
death resulted from natural cause's! i
j and at the conclusion of his visit here,
j h& freely expressed the opinion that j
such was the fact.
From the first the Honolulu police
pursued a policy of most extraordinary i
and Inexplicable secrecy and mystifi- j
j cation of every one concerned. No ex
j planation of it has been made except f
I Sheriff Henry's statement as regard* '
i the scientific men, that he didn't want f
them to be embarrassed at the inquest [
by having expressed their opinions.
The fact is that nearly all of them '
did so in a private way. The Sheriff
made numerous conflicting statements
which served to utterly mislead the
public and gave rise to endless ru- â¢
mors.
There are many who think that the
cause of Mrs. Stanford's death will
never be known. It has apparently i
passed into the field of medical con- |
troversy and unless some striking reve- j
lations are brought forth from sources I
now unknown there can be no intelli
gent conclusions drawn from the dif-
I fering opinions of the doctors.

were visible on the steamer, the
Oceanic line pennant at the maintop
and the Union Jack at half mast.
ALAMEDA ANCHORS.
A? the Alameda reached a point op
posite Meiggs wharf she cast anchor
and the Government quarantine boat
General .Steinberg, closely followed
by the Government tug Hartley with
the newspaper men on. board, put
off for the liner. As the Hartley
drew near the faces of many of the
passengers became discernable, among
them Detectives Callundan and Rey
nolds, Dr. Jordan and Timothy J.
Hopkins. Neither MLss Berner nor
Mna Hunt approached the rajl while
the vessel was at anchor.
While the Hartley was maneuvering
for a berth alongside, the Golden Gate
drew up on the starboard side of the
Alameda and the members of th.?
party, together with Detectives Tom
Gibson, Xed Gibson and Jerry Â©man,
went aboard after the Tapid inspection
by the quarantine officers.
Among those who climbed the lad
der from th,e Golden Gate to the Ala
meda were Mountford S. Wilson.
George Crothers and other Stanford
representatives. At the same time all
the press representatives were receiv
ed on board the Golden Gate, but per
mission to board the Alameda was re
fused, although the quarantine flag
had been lowered.
Soon thereafter the Golden Gate
proceeded down the bay to the Pa
cific-street wharf, where the Alameda
docks, and as it drew near the wharf
the true significance of the last home
coming of Mrs. Stanford became ap
parent. Ships and buildings all had
flags at half-mast and at the end of
the long wharf stood groups of rela
tive* and friends of the home-comers.
Interspersed among them were squads
of police with stars draped with
crape. â¢,__
The police arrangements - were as
elaborate as any seen here for many
years. Squads' of- mtn averaging.
twenty-five to -the, s>quad front aJI the
stations in the city, under command
ot their captains and lieutenants,
gave the one bright flash to the other
wise somber setting of the funeral
cortege. The police at the en
trance of the pier were under com
mand of Captain Thomas S. Duke,
while Captain Gleeson had charge of
the pier itself. Acting Chief Spillane
in citizen's dress kept a watchful eye
on all the details.
LATHKOP OX THE PIER.
Carriages hearing Charles L.athrop,
his wife and daughter and many mem
bers of the family stood under the long
shed. Relatives of Miss Hunt and other
passengers on the steamer were the
only ones allowed on the wharf. At
the entrance were drawn up two coiy
dons of police, while detached squads
under the command of sergeants kept
the crowds back.
The crowds were forced back to the
sidewalk on the south side of East
street and filled the wide thoroughfare
i on each side of the lane formed by the
i men in blue. At all times, despite the
j constant pressure of people and jam
I of trucks, were the spectators orderly
and the police had little difficulty in
keeping them in check. Thousands
j took advantage of the Jackson-street
I pier and It was packed with a mass
I of curious humanity that waited pa
tiently the arrival of the Alameda.
| Many had found places of vantage
early in the morning and the varie
gated colors of the women's garb
added to the picturesque scene on the
â  water froijt.
Their period of waiting came to an
end at 11 o'clock, when the nose of the
Alameda appeared around the end of
the Broadway wharf, and soon she was
moored alongside the Pacific-street
pier. The same faces were at the rail.
I neither Miss Berner nor Miss Hunt
â¢ appearing.
Immediately the gangways were
hoisted and the police superintended
the boarding of the boat. At first only
the relatives of Mrs. Stanford, Miss
Berner and Miss Hunt and press rep
resentatives were allowed to board, but
'later, after the main salon had been
carefully guarded fÂ»om trespassers, the
police allowed all visitors in the shed
to go aboard the steamer.
In the main salon, under the watch
ful eyes of detectives and those in
terested in the Stanford estate, sat
Miss Berner, heavily veiled and in deep
mourning, and Miss Hunt, whose' face
was framed in black. On one side of
Miss Hunt was her mother, and on
the other Mrs. Irvine, a friend from
San Mateo.
BODY BROUGHT ASHORE.
Down in the forward hold beneath
the forward hatch lay the body of Mrs.
Stanford, reposing in the tnetal and
mahogany coffin in the purple and
black-draped compartment built espe
cially for its accommodation. On all
sides were stands of flowers, and the
floor was strewn with rice chaff. Half
an hour after the Alameda docked the
forward starboard freight port was
thrown open and the coffin was carried
by six stalwart sailors from the ship
to, its resting place In the hearse. Al
most at the moment that the body
reached land the whistles of near-by
factories shrilly sounded the noon
hour and the gilt hands of the ferry
clock pointed to 12.
After the body was placed in the
hearse the twelve carriages that ac
companied it to the Third and Towns
end streets depot drew up at the main
gangway and began to receive their
occupants. In the first carriage sat
Charles Lathrop, his wife and his
daughter, Jennie Lathrop, and Judge
S. F. Lelb. In the second, Miss Berner,
Detectives Callundan and Reynolds and
Mountford S. Wilson. In the third,
Miss Hunt, her .mother and Miss Irvine.
In the remaining carriages came Pro

it was learned that its contents are
simply a reiteration of the statement
made by Dr^ Jordan and concurred in
by Timothy Hopkins and given to the
press on the eve of their departure
from Honolulu, except that their for
merly expressed views are elaborated
upon so far as details of the investiga
tion pursued by the San Francisco de
tectives are concerned.
Though the murder theory is not
popular with the San Franciscans who
went to Honolulu, Attorney Wilson
said last night that this fact does not
mean that the vigilance of the detec
tives will be relaxed in the least. "All
we want," satd he, "is the truth, and
if a crime has been committed it is
our intention to use every possible
means to punish the criminal. It is
true that we should prefer lo learn
that no murder had been committed,
but. if it -was murder, we want the
world to know it, and will never rest
until the guilt is properly placed."
The mystery attending the sending of
the dispatch from Honolulu by High
Sheriff Henry to Acting Chief of Police
Spillane, which the island official later
repudiated, was cleared yesterday. It
appears that High Sheriff Henry was
Informed by the chemist who analyzed
the bicarbonate of soda found in Mrs.
Stanford's rooms at the Moana Hotel
that the bottle contained forty-three
grama or 663 grains of soda, in which
strychnine was found.
The .Sheriff, however, misinterpret
ed the information as meaning that in
a bottle of forty-three drams there
had been discovered 663 grains of
strychnine, and so advised the local
officials. Later, when he discovered
his mistake his humiliation prompted
him to deny the authorship of the ca
blegram. Captain Callundan said
yesterday that he had found High
Sheriff Henry a very obliging and
willing assistant, who, however, had
lacked the necessary assistance in
sifting the mystery' of the Stanford
case.
With a view to making a further
and more careful investigation of the
probable causes of Mrs. Stanford's
death, the detectives brought with
them from Honolulu portions of the
woman's organs, among them the
brain, heart and contents of the
stomadh, together with the remainder
of the bottle of bicarbonate of soda
and the cascara capsules found in her
room on the night she died. These
members of the university faculty and
student body.
After all had entered the carriages
the funeral cortege began its journey
to the depot. Slowly the hearse and
carriages passed out between two files
of police, who stood with bared heads,
while the crowd thronging the street
and sidewalks looked silently on. At
itR head rode an escort comprising
mounted Policemen Merchant, Greg
gains. Daly. Haley, Harrington, Guest,
Norton and Pidgeon, and a foot escort
consisting of Policemen Cavanaugh,
Maloney, Driscoll and Tillman, headed
by Corporal Birdsall and Sergeant
Gorman.
START FOR DEPOT.
In order to avoid notoriety and curi
osity the corteg# proceeded by an in
direct route to the railroad station.
Passing along East street it turned in
to Howard and thence into Second
street, Leaving Second street the fun
eral train passed through South Park
and thence along Third street to the
depot.
Before the depot another cordon of
police with a provost guard of mounted
men all under the command of Lieu
tenant Miqhael Cpnboy, were drawn up
to receive the funeral procession. One
by one the carriages drove up and their
occupants entered the station between
lines of police. The carriage contain
ing Miss Hunt, her mother and Miss
Irvine drove up to the entrance and
then drove rapidly away with its occu
pants to a place of seclusion.
While the mourners were alighting at
the station entrance the hearse drove
to the train sheds at Fourth street,
where another guard of police was sta
tioned, and the casket was placed on
the funeral car without any special
ceremony. At five minutes to 1 the
special train of three cars, with the
funeral coach in the middle, started on
its journey to Palo Alto, carrying Mrs.
Stanford for the last time from the
city that has so long witnessed her
generous acts and noble career. In
Palo Alto she will rest in the Stanford
Mausoleum beside the husband whose
wealth led to the founding of the great
university and the dearly beloved son
whose name it bears and who was its
inspiration.

POLICE GET BEVERLY LETTER.
Miss Berner Fulfills Promise Made to
Detectives.
One of the important motives of the
police in making the flying visit to
Palo Alto after the arrival of the Stan
ford remains was to obtain possession
of an alleged threatening letter ad
dressed to Miss Bertha Berner by the
former butler. Albert Beverly. This
was secured and is in the hands of
Captain Callundan, who declined to
discuss its contents.
Some surprise was expressed that th<=
local detectives should find it necessary
to accompany the body to Palo Alto,
especially in view of their statements
that they would return the same even
ing. The theory was advanced that they
were keeping Miss Berner under sur
veillance, but this they denied. The
bringing of the letter with them when
they returned in the afternoon Is a suf
ficient reason for their taking the trip
to Palo Alto.
Scarcely had the train stopped be
fore Detectives Gibson and Callundan
were out of the cars and Into a car
riage headed for the Stanford estate.
There Miss Berner had told them they
would find the Beverly letter, and upon
the arrival of the hearse and Miss Ber
ner in the carriage the search for the
letter began. In a few minutes Miss

Miss Hunt was seated at a table in

MRS. STANFORD'S BODY
LIES AT COUNTRY ESTATE
Will Be Removed to Memorial Church Friday
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
21. â It was nearly 2 o'clock this aft
ernoon when the private funeral train
bearing the body of Mrs. Stanford ar
rived at Menlo Park. The coffin was
immediately placed in the awaiting
hearse. Then the little procession of
friends moved slowly out on the coun
ty road to the home on the Palo Alto
estate. There the body was taken from
the hearse and laid in the main room
of the Stanford mansion. The rela
tives, friends and student representa
tives who had accompanied the re
mains from San Francisco passed in
single file through the room and looked
for a moment at the closed coffin. Then
they passed out of the house and drove
away, leaving the body of Mrs. Stan
ford in charge of Charles G. Lathrop,
brother of the dead woman.
Miss Bertha Berner did not follow
the funeral procession to the Stan
ford mansion, but, accompanied by
Mountford Wilson, she was driven di
rect to her home in the foothills back
of the university. In her lap she car
ried a basket of fresh tropical fruit,
brought all the way from Honolulu.
Mr. Wilson helped Miss Berner from
the carriage and then hurried to catch
the return train for San Francisco.
There was no demonstration at the
station when the funeral train pulled
into the Menlo Park depot. The crowds
were at Palo Alto, where, since 10
o'clock in the morning, they had been
patiently waiting for the arrival of the
body. Foreseeing this, arrangements
had been made to have the body taken
from the cars at Menlo Park, and
when at last the train stopped at Palo
Alto the tired throng gazed disap
pointed at the empty coaches.
EMPLOYES GATHER.
At the Menlo Park station there
were gathered about fifty persons.
Many of these were the old employes
of the stock farm, who had been told
where the body would be removed. As
the coffin was lifted from the door of
the car the company stood with bowed
heads, their hats clutched in their
hands, many of them with tears run
ning down their wrinkled cheeks. Some
difficulty was experienced in raising
the coffin into the hearse, and when
these hardy employes saw the trouble
they stepped forward with one accord
and helped carry the bier, each man
anxious to do some little service for
his dead mistress.
The servant who took the death of
Mrs. Stanford most to heart was
Charley Wooster, the aged coachman.
For forty years he has been in the
Stanford service, coming out from New
York with them in the early days.
He sat on the box of the same car
riage in which he had driven his mis
tress to the station on the fatal day
that she sailed for Hawaii. The old
driver was weeping when the train
came In, and although he tried his best
to hide his emotion, when the coffin
was lifted into the hearse his large
frame shook with sobbing. He would
not drive the hearse, but he followed
close behind with the carriage of Mr.
and Mrs. Lathrop.
Detective Gibson was the first man
to alight from the funeral train at
Menlo Park. He was on the steps be
fore the cars stopped, and he hurried
forward to the baggage car, where
the coffin had been placed. Close be
hind him was Detective Collundan.
These two stood beside the coffin as
it was taken from the train. Presi
dent David Starr Jordan and Timothy
Hopkins came next, both looking tired
and worn. Then followed; the funeral
escort, composed of representatives
from the faculty, alumni and students
of the university.
MISS BERNER ARRIVES.
A flutter of excitement passed
through the small crowd at the depot

blage of students at the train. It had
been intended to have the entire body
of 1500 students meet the Alameda at
the dock and not as an escort to the
lemains of their beloved benefactor.
They were to have been brought down
to Palo Alto on a special train, and
then to have followed the body to the
home on the estate. The relatives of
ifrs. Stanford, however, expressed the
Irish that the arrival of the body
should be marked with great simplic
ity, and tho plan of the students was
quickly changed. Four undergradu
ates, one member from each class,
acted as the student escort of the body.
The body of Mrs. Stanford will lie
in state in her Palo Alto residence un

of that day the bier will be taken to

SECRETARY GIVES
NO NEW LIGHT.
Has Nothing to Add to
Her Testimony.
Declares That She Has Told Everything
The meeting between Miss Berne*r
and her brother in the dining-hall of
the Alameda was pathetic. Miss Ber
ner, who is a delicate, refined little
woman, and had borne the frightful
strain of the last three weeks with re
markable composure, at the sight of
her brother was hardly able to restrain
herself. For three weeks, since the
death of her patron and friend, she has
been alone in a foreign land among
strangers and without one friend to
whom she could turn for comfort and
relief. The death of the one she has
been in constant company with for
over twenty years was in itself a ter
rible blow to her, even if that death
were caused by natural causes. When,
however, the causes were found by the
Coroner's jury to have been from pois
oning and that suspicion naturally
must fall on those in and about Mrs.
Stanford's household, her anguish was
extreme. All this agony and suspense
she suffered among strangers, and it
was only natural that she should give
way when she was once again repos
ing in the strong arms of her brother
Robert. Sister and brother retired to
a quiet part of the dining-hall, but It
was several minutes before they spoke.
Miss Berner's first Inquiries were for
her aged mother, after which she
lapsed into silence and quietly waited
for the time to come when Mrs. Stan
ford's body should be removed from
the vessel and she should take the
train bound for her home at Palo Alto.
Miss Berner, like the others interest
ed in the case from Honolulu, was
close-mouthed. She had nothing to
say upon the subject. Timothy Hop
kins, however, immaculate in tall silk
hat and long black coat, said he would
speak for Miss Berner. He announced
this fact as he came up on deck from
the hold, where he had been superin
tending the arrangements to have the
remains of Mrs. Stanford taken on
shore. He said it was hot in the hold
and climbing the stairs had put him
out of breath. In relation to Miss
Berner he said: "You can say this
from me for Miss Berner if you like.
She has told everything she knew about
the incidents appertaining to the death
of Mrs. Stanford. She told all this to
the Coroner's Jury in Honolulu. She
has nothing to hide and she has hid
nothing. Her statement to you now
is the same as she made before the
Jury, and the public has been apprised
of this through the press. She went
into the matter there fully and com
pletely. She answered every question
put to her and she threw every pos
sible light upon the subject. We have
told her not to talk, but there is noth
ing more for her to talk about. If she
should ever be called upon to say any
thing more here in this case she can
only repeat what she has already
given out."
TESTIMONIAL FROM MILLS.
Young Women Students and Faculty
Feel Keenly the Loss.
At a meeting of the faculty and stu
dents of Mills College the following
resolutions were adopted:
Whereas. In thÂ» providence of God. Mrs.
Jane L.. Stanford has been suddenly removed
by death from the scene of her beneficent la
bors; and whereas. It Is our desire to express
suitably our appreciation of her sterling worth
and our admiration for the great she has
accomplished: therefore be it
Resolved. That we record our profound re
gret that her life has been "cut short In the
midst of her abundant labors for the upbuild
ing of a great university, which, however,
established upon a sure foundation, will ever
be a monument and an honor to herself, to her
husband and to their beloved son.
Resolved, That we honor her memory and
rejoice In the fact that her noble traits of
character will never be forgotten in the State
to which she has given so much, both In ex
ample and In material advancement.
Resolved. That we tender to the. faculty and
students of the Leland Stanford Jr. University
our heartfelt sympathy and express to them
our earnest hope that the aims of the founders
of that noble Institution may be fully realized.

RAILROADS WILL
CARRY FREIGHT
RENO, March 21.â The embargo
placed upon all freight excepting the
necessities of life by the Southern Pa
cific Company some time ago will be
raised to-morrow morning. This im
portant news was announced to-day.
It is the result of an official visit to the
southern country by General Manager
Calvin. He returned from there yes
terday and to-day the announcement
came. Thousands of tons of freight,
consisting of mining machinery and In
some instances entire hotels, are now
sidetracked along the line waiting for
the embargo to be lifted.
While it was in force the express
company reaped a harvest, carload
after carload of material having been
shipped in at full express rates. The
new order, it is thought, will stimulate
the boom now on in that country.
HOBOES MAKE TROUBLE
IN THE TOWN OF KENNET
Lightning Injures Electric Light Plant
and Tramps Take Advantage of
Ensuing Darkness.
REDDING, March 21. â The citi
zens of the smelter town of Kennet
were greatly excited last night. Light
ning put the lights out and the town
was in total darkness. The trouble
was added to by a band of hoboes
that threatened to make a disturb
ance. It is thought the hoboes cut
the wires in order to commit crime
under the cover of darkness. The
tramps were driven from town this
morning.

KUROPATKIN TO LEAD
ONE OF THE ARMIES
TAKES POST UNDER LINEVITCH
Veteran Exhibits
Greatness in
Defeat
ST. PETERS March 22. 2:20
a. m.â The Russian army in Manchuria
is still to have the services of General
Kuropatkin. who is considered by
many, in spite of his series of re
verses, to be its best general and fore
most strategist- Sinking all feeling of
yeiÃonal bitterness because of his su
perc-ession and all the old time enmity
Detvveen himself and General Linevitch
in a imtnotie desire to be of â¢ vice
to thÂ«- tatherland. the former com
aiander-in-chief volunteered to remain
1, any capacity with the army which
he had so long commanded. The tender
has been accepted by Emperor
Nicholas and gratetuily received by the
new leader of the Grand Army.
Th* change exactly reverses the <>ld
rder of aftaire. when Kumpatkin was
:ht supreme leader and Linevitch di
<=-cted the First Army
Authoritative news of the remarkable
step was known in Manchuria much
âº ariier than in St. Petersburg. General
Kuropatkin, having paused on his
homeward journey at Harbin, started
southward on the afternoon of March
20 amid a most remarkable farewell
from residents of Harbin and soldiers
who we on the way to nil out the
ranks of the depleted army- The send
off wu a mere foretaste of what
awaits General Kuropatkin at the
front; and his self -sacrificing determi-
XL&tion and the equally patriotic course
of General Linevitch in accepting the
services tendered are bound to do won
ders for the retospiration of the Em
peror's legions and give promise of
union and harmony at the council table
which the army has hitherto lacked.
The retreat is apparently progressing
uneventfully. No dispatches vf mo
ment were received yesterday.
Little weight is placed here on the
deduction drawn at certain European
capitals from the dispatch announc
ing hat cannonading had been heard
south of Tie Pass and that General Ren
nenkampff's corps, endeaving to rejoin
'the main army, had been intercepted
south of Tie Pass. As stated yesterday
morning, the dispatch in question un
doubtedly was erroneous, and it may
be pointed out that several corre
spondents at the front have mentioned
the orderly retreat of General Line
vitch's army and asserted that it ef
fected a concent ratian at Tie Pass with
scarcely a straggler missing, but made
BO mention of the absence of so' well
known a fighter as Rennenkampff. In
addition. Correspondent Toiuzakoff,
Â«ho was with Rennenkampff's com
mand during the battle, has arrived
at genera! headquarters. slightly
wounded.
Preparations are now making for the
mobilization of a rumber of detach
ments, not however, on a general scale,
the' preliminary orders affecting but
twenty-two districts la the Govern
ments of Odessa, Warsaw and Moscow.
Th- Grenadiers have not received or
tiers t<.Â» proceed to Manchuria, but many
oflicen of that organization, drafted to
'â t'mmard units now bound for the
front. Wi Moscow yesterday.

NEW YORK. March 21. â Progress

when the bonds were offered at 88.
While the New York bankers inter

lII â¢SSJANS TO JIARE A STAND.
\\ ill Attempt to Hold the Railroad
Below Kirin.
TOKIO, March 21. â The fact that
no reports of the retreat of the Rus
sian armies or of the Japanese pursuit
were received to-day is strengthening
the belief that it iB the Russian plan
to hold the line from Changkoun to
Kirln.
The Japanese continue to closely
follow Linevitch's rearguard. The
damaged bridges, however, impede the
progress of the pursuers, and the re
pairing of these bridges may create
sufficient delay to permit the Russians
to reconcentrate, reinforce and par
tially reorganize, and enable them to
construct works along the Changkoun-
Kirin line.
It is reported that a portion of the
Vladivostok garrison has been with
drawn and hurried to Harbin, but con
firmation of this report cannot be ob
tained.

LONDON. March 21. â Russian offi
cial circles in London, although with
out official confirmation, are inclined
to credit a Harbin story published in
Paris connecting the firing reported
to have been heard yesterday morning
about seven miles* south of Tie Pass
with General RennenkampfTs divi
sion. A dispatch from Harbin points
out that the only explanation of a
cannonade in that locality is that Ren
nenkampff has at length arrived at
Tie Pass, where the Russian armies
were ordered to rendezvous in case of
retreat, but only to find the place
occupied by the Japanese. Conse
quently it is feared that Ren
nenkampff Is surrounded.

ST. PETERSBURG. March 21. â
General LJnevftch's headquarters have
been pstablished for the present at
Chenchiawatzu, situated at the cross
ing of the Sungari River, whence he is
directing the retreat of three armies
and disposing of the fresh troops of
the Fourth Corps, just arrived from
European Russia. The protection of
the Sungari bridge is vital to the sal
vation of the army, as the river is not
fordable below Kirin and once the
line of the river is passed and the
bridge blown up the Japanese pursuit
will be effectively checked. At the
same time the Second Army is falling
back on the line of the railroad, while
the First and Third and transports are
retreating along the Mandarin road to
Kirin. destroying bridges and roads and
denuding the country behind them and
making it impossible for the Japanese
to live in the immediate wake of the
retreat without their own commis
pnri;itÃ.
The Japanese are advancing on the
Grand Trade route, twenty miles west
of the railroad. Apparently there is a
question as to which army will out
march the other, although the general
staff seriously doubts the ability of
Field Marshal Oyama's fatigued sol
diers to continue the pursuit indefi
nitely.

TWO NATIONS
MAY END FEUD
Germany Striving* to Bring;
About a Reconciliation
With French Republic
LONDON. March 21.â The Daily
Chronicle this morning claims to have
the authority of the German Embassy
at London for stating that Germany is
anxious for a reconciliation with
France, and that Emperor William is
desirous of getting on terms of closest
friendship with the French Govern
ment.
According to a high official of the
embassy, whom the Daily Chronicle
interviewed, the present moment IKI
considered most opportune to arrive at
such an understanding, the Russo-
Japanese war having entirely chanped
the political situation. Germany, this
official said, had reason to consider the
Franco-Russian alliance as directed
against herself and in that case the
motive of German overtures to France
might have been misjudged. . Now,
however, it will be impossible for Rus
sia to engage in war with Germany for
years to come, even if she wished,
and. therefore, if the question of re
venge is buried there is nothing to
prevent Germany and France shaking
hands and inaugurating an era of
peace and good will.
Prince Henry's visit to France to see
the James Gordon Bennett automobile
cup race will be the first official visit
of t> Prussian Prince since the war,
and the relations of the two countries
never have been better. Germany has
no territorial designs on Morocco ul
no desire to embarrass French political
ambitions, her only wish beinj; to open

France Inclined to Allow
America to Handle Case
While Holland Prepares
to tise Coercive Measures
WILLEMSTAD. Island of Curacoa,
March 21.â The Venezuelan Govern
ment, it is announced from Caracas,
has received a note from the American
Minister, Bowen, requesting an answer
as to whether Venezuela will arbitrate
the questions pending and saying that,
in case of a, refusal, the United States
will feel free to take the step which
may be necessary to secure justice.
The Charge d'Affaires of The Nether
lands has advised the Venezuelan
Government that Holland will use co
ercive measures in view of the fact
that she has been unable to secure the
release from imprisonment in Vene
zuela of five Dutch sailors who have
been illegally kept in prison for seven
months.
WASHINGTON, March 21.â 1n call
ing upon President Castro for an an
swer to his propostion to submit to ar
bitration the issues between the United
States and Castro, Minister Bowen is
acting in accordance with specific in
structions from the State Department
which have recently been placed in his
hands. Bowen made a proposition of
this kind to the Venezuelan Foreign
Office several months ago, and there
was an exchange of notes on the sub
ject, but its further consideration was
cut off by the abrupt departure from
the capital of President Castro at a
moment when his own decision was re
quired. The Venezuelan Government
at that stage had made a counter
proposition to Bowen. This was con
strued here as an attempt to bring into
play the old Calvo doctrine, which the
United States has resolutely and re
peatedly refused to accept in its nego
tiations with the Southern republics.
Besides the New York and Bermu
dez asphalt case there are three other
matters which are suggested as prop
|er subjects for arbitration, namely,
i the Critchfleld claim (also based on
an asphalt concession): the claim of
the Orinoco Steam Navigation Com
pany, based on a violated franchise,
and the claim of the newspaper cor
respondent Jaurett for damages aris
ing from his summary expulsion from
Venezuela.
If President Castro rejects this last
! offer of Bowen to arbitrate these cases
; it is expected that he will promptly
report that fact to th.c Sta,te Depart
ment and it will be determined what
course to pursue. The Minister's pre
sentment of this matter, therefore, is
not an, actual ultimatum, for the way
is" still open for further negotiations
jf the department decides that the
time has not yet arrived to withdraw
its Minister and adopt some coercive
measures. There is great reluctance
on the part of officials to adopt the
latter course, but the situation is be
lieved to be such that some action
must be taken very soon.
PARIS, March 21. â The Foreign :
Office says the French Minister at j
Caracas has not presented an ultima
tum to Venezuela and no French war- I
ships have been sent to Venezuela. '
The officials here are surprised and
displeased at the reports, which they
construe as tending to force the hand
of France into a more aggressive and
belligerent policy than anything
France contemplates. Intimations are
that the United States occupies the
f best position to send warships, owing
| to the length of time the American
â¢ controversy with Venezuela has been
pending, whereas the French contro- j
versy is of comparative recent ori- ;
gin and has not yet been decided by '

TARRTTOWN, N. V.. March 21 â
The millions ef John D. Rockefeller and
his brother. William Rockefeller, failed
to count to-day in an effort to carry
the village election of North Tarrytown
for the people's ticket, headed by War
ren J. Stoddard, former trustee, for
president. The anti-Rockefeller ticket,
known as, the Citizens' ticket, headed
by John Wirth, a young butcher, won
by a plurality of 148.
This result is unprecedented in the
history of North Tarrytown, where the
Rockefellers own property worth $2,
000,000. In years gone by the Rocke
feller candidates had things their own
way. This year the tables were turned
and the Rockefellers failed to corral
votes for the good of the People's party
cause.
All along Wirth was confident of suc
cess, and his friends made large wagers
that he would win.
Despite a heavy downpour of rain,
the election fight in North Tarrytown
brought out the largest vote in the
history of the village. In all 933 votes
were cast. Wirth received 515, while
his opponent got 367.
It was openly charged that represen
tatives of the oil king had colonized ne
groes and Italians. About 300 Italians
and negroes voted from the Rockefeller
domain. Many of the Italians are em
ployed on Rockefeller's place in build
ing roads, beautifying his park and
constructing a new reservoir.
The Italians and negroes were
brought to the polls at North Tarry
town in all kinds of traps. Some of the
Italians rode in stages, while others
enjoyed their first ride in automobiles.
Cigars and light refreshments also
were supplied them.

tude to the strong old man who gave
him his start in life, he believes that
Stebbins was insane for some time be
fore his death and It was with tears
in his eyes that he gave to the lawyers
the answers that were read in court
this morning.
On a cold March day a few years
before the Civil War a little fellow,
ragged and torn, applied to Charles M.
Stebbins, president of the Western
Missouri Telegraph Company, for a job.
He got it. The boy was Robert dowry.
His advance was rapid. He held a re
sponsible telegraphic position during
the war. Step by step he climbed to
his present position and he owes hiÂ«
success to Charles M. Stebbtns. the
man who fell from prominence and dis
tinction and became a suspicious and
licentious old man.
Colonel Clowry told of the early bus
iness life of Stebbins; of bis great
sagacity and ability to m*ke money:
of how he invested in many stranÂ«Â»
ventures, always profitably. Then hÂ«
told of his sudden start Â«n the road
to decline. From a neatly-dressed
business man Stebbins became a tramp
in appearance and his friends left him
in disgust.
dowry's story was one of thÂ« most
pathetic that has come out durtn* the
hearing.
ACCUSES READER
OF FALSIFYING
Dominican Representative
in New York Places Pro
moter in a Bad Light
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March 21 âOfficial con
firmation is lacking now of the story of
Mr. and Mrs. Reader to the effect that
a gunboat and the big stick" kept
them from syndicating the island <>f
Santo Domingo. Senor Emiiio C. Jou
bert, the highest representative o_ the
Dominican republic here, says that
President Morales refused to even see
A. B. Reader when he sent in his name
and a photograph of Mrs. Reader and
craved an audience. Mrs. Reader,
when she heard what the Senor Â»aiÂ«l,
replied:
"Of course, he knows nothing about
it, for Mr. Joubert was not there at all.
I am quite sure he was not."
Senor Joubert. even at the risk of
contradicting a woman, insists that he
was present when Reader attempted a
conference.
WASHINGTON, March 21.â The pro
jected reorganization of the force of
American customs collectors in Santo
Domingo, based upon the expectation
that the Senate would approve the
pending treaty before adjournment, has
been indefinitely postponed and it is
impossible that any changes will bÂ«
made in the near future beyond tha
relief of Commander Leiper, who is
now acting collector at Monte Crlsti.
Commander Leioer Is called upon to
go north to put his ship out of com
mission at the Boston navy yard. ThÂ«
collection at Monte Crlsti and Puerto
Plata therefore will be under Abbot's
direction for the present.
Some apprehension is felt here as to
the probable action of those European
powers that have claims affalnat Santo
Domingo and it would not surprise the
officials here if some attempt wers*
made to obtain Joint action by these
powers to seize the customs revenue*
at some Dominican port.

CHEERING NEWS

Ex-Congressman Bell Says
Work on New (oilier Will
Be Commenced at Once
VALLEJO, March 21.âEx-Congress
man Theodore Bell, who is visiting
Vallejo as the guest of F. R. Devlin,
held an informal reception at the Elks'
Club last evening. He received a cor
dial welcome from Vallejoites and was
thanked for his efforts on behalf of
Mare Island in the last Congress.
Bell does not think the work on the
new collier will be delayed by the fail
ure of the conference committee to al
low an additional $200,000 to defray the
cost of certain changes in the plans of
the vessel. He says that the Chief of
the Bureau of Construction and Re
pair, Constructor Capps, informed him
just before he left Washington that
work on the collier would be com
menced at once.
Bell has resumed the practice of law
and will defend Cooper, the mess at
tendant on the cruiser Boston, who is
charged with the murder of a ship
mate.

GETS HIS DOES
IN YOLO COUNTY
W. B. Kennedy, Alias "Yel
low."' Sent to Folsom for
P> Years for Burglary
CONFESSES HIS CRIME
Felon Accused of Killing
Officer Bobinson in This
City Heavily Punished
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, March 21.â W. B. Ken- ;
nedy, alias "Yellow," who after a sen- .
sational light in the courts of San
Francisco escaped punishment for his
share In the murder of Policeman Rob
inson, did not fare so well In the courts
of Yolo County. He was, to-day sen
tenced to serve forty-five years in Fol-
Bom for robbing a number of stores in
the town of Dunnigan in this county
last January. He left the courtroom
smiling, for he had, in view of the
fact that he had pleaded guilty and
admitted a prior conviction in lowa,
expected the limit of the law, a life
sentence.
Kennedy's three companions in the
Dunnigan crime all pleaded guilty and
received heavy sentences. When his
case was called to-day Kennedy re
fused to avail himself of the usual
privileges allowed defendants. He
would not take the stand in his own
behalf or allow his attorney to offer
any evidence in the case, evidently
feeling certain that an effort to contra
dict the testimony of the prosecution
would serve him but little. In fact, it
was at his suggestion that the case
was submitted to the jury without ar
gument. The jury took but one ballot,
returning a verdict of burglary in the
first degree after only a few minutes'
deliberation.
When the verJict was announced
Kennedy waived time and asked for
sentence immediately. He got It â for
ty-five years in Folsom. The case is
one of the shortest criminal cases on
record. It occupied but half a day.
Kennedy's share of the Dunnigan
booty amounted to $19 50 and a dozen
pocket knives. The knives, which were j
buried near Woodland by "Yellow," .
were found by a lineman in the em
ploy of the telephone company.
TO PLEAD FOR HIS SON.
Father of Alan Goucher Will Make
l^ist Appeal to Jury.
Two lawyers pleaded to save the
neck of Alan (alias "Kid") Goucher in
Judge Cook's court yesterday. One,
T. Crowley, took the testimony of the
prosecution as given by each witness
and did his best to tear the fabric to
pieces. The other, Reese Clark, after
verbose denunciations , of everybody
connected with the prosecution, plead
ed in a lachrymose fashion for mercy,
referring frequently to the scriptures.
At the conclusion he painted a tear
ful picture of Mrs. Goucher witnessing
the hanging of her wayward son. "Re
member," he said, "every punishment
you put on this boy will be a scar on
his mother's soul."
Clark began at 2 and talked without
a break until nearly 5. Several times
he announced that he was about to
conclude, but often when he verged on
the edge of a peroration, causing the
jury's spirits to rise, he seemed tv
change his mind and broke into fresh
denunciation.
"Senator" Goucher, father of the
defendant, will make the final plea for
his son's life this morning. Then Dis
trict Attorney Byington. will close for
the prosecution. The ease will prob
ably go to the jury this evening.

Special Dispatch to The Ca!l.
SACRAMENTO, March 21.âTwenty
four young and pretty members of
Califla Parlor, Native Daughters of
the Golden West, dressed themselves in
male attire last night and gave a min
strel performance to an audience com
posed exclusively of women, of whom
nearly 400 were present. No men or
representatives of the press were per
mitted to enter the hall and every ef
fort at privacy was made, but the lo
cal hits and specialties of the winsome
young performers were so clever that
the details of the performance became
th* subject of general discussion to
day.
The Native Daughters took the
names of well-known Native Sons, and
the jokes each was made to suffer
were comical in the extreme. The
young women, who comprise many of
the prettiest girls in Sacramento, were
attired in men's full evening dress,
tuxedo coats, expansive shirt fronts,
trousers and all. Four particularly
dainty maidens, so arrayed, acted as
ushers, but the hall was not large
enough to accommodate the women
who flocked thither.
The most dignified citizens of the
town were made the target of jibes so
caustic that many of them never would
have been uttered in a mixed audience,
but the members of Califla Parlor
deemed themselves safe in a house
made up entirely of their own sex.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. March 21.â Buying a light
bicycle at Fairbanks for JSO J. H. Scott,
a San Francisco traveling man, rode
the wheel two hundred miles toward
Valdcs in four and a half days. He
would have wheeled clear to Valdes
had not a snow storm covered the trail
with soft snow, making further use of
the wheel impossible. He used a sleigh
for the rest of the distance.
Scott spent seventeen days in Fair
banks and hurried out with important
news for the wholesale hardware firm
ho represents. He left this morning
for San Francisco. He found the trail
lined with travelers for Fairbanks,
passing seventy-six in one section of
twenty-six miles. Most of thetravelers
were green and they sought detailed
information regarding the trail and dis
tances. They were taking in outfits
comprising liquors, cigars, flour, horse
feed, groceries, condensed milk and
delicacies.
An unusually early spring is making
the trail soft and causing travelers to
relay their outfits on going over the
divides. Thieves are plentiful along
the trail, with the result that a large
part of the outfit is being stolen
nightly.
DEATH RECALLS
TRAGIC AFFAIR
Victim of Rival's Shot Dies
After Nearly Two Years of
the Most Awful Agony
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 21.â The death of
Thomas Thurnbow to-day at Garfleld
closes another chapter in one of the
tragedies for which Whitman County
is famous.
One Sunday morning in August, 1903,
G. E. Brown shot Thurnbow on the
streets of Garfleld. The bullet struck
Ms spine and caused paralysis. From
that day until his death Thurnbow suf
fered untold agonies. For months he
was a living skeleton, the dried flesh
dropping from his bones. Thurnbow
and Brown were rival real estate deal
ers.
There was much talk of lynching
Brown when the shooting occurred.
Had Thurnbow died within a year after
the shooting Brown would have been
tried for murder. He was tried for
attempt to murder, found guilty and
sentenced to five years in the penlten*
tiary. Thurnbow's funeral will be one
of the largest ever held in Eastern
Washington.

METEOR STOPS
OFFICER'S WALK
Falls Within Three Feet
of a Special Policeman
on Way to Station House
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, March 21.â While hot
from Its swift flight fhrough the at
mosphere a meteorite fell literally at
the feet of Special Officer Chlldress at
the corner of First and Oak streets as
he was on his way to the police sta
tion at 5:30 this morning.
As the messenger from the heavens
struck the street, not over three feet
from the policeman, it was broken into
many pieces. A fragment somewhat
larger than the others fell into a pool,
where it spluttered for some time.
Enough pieces of the meteorite were
gathered to show that it weighed about
a pound when it reached the earth.
This afternoon a fragment weighing
seven and a half pennyweights was
taken to a well-known assayer and
subjected to various tests. Analysis
showed the meteorite to be crystallized
white quartz. Part of the surface is
"feathered" by intense heat. This
"feathering" perforates the quartz so
finely as to make it resemble pumice
stone.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
ROBBERY DRAMA FALLS UNDER CLASSES

Miss Mabel Perry Accidentally
Witnesses the Hold-Up of
Daly and Roche.
Tells Hep Strange Tale to Sheriff
I'AKLANP, March . 21. â Complete
verification of the statements made by
John E. Daly and Frank K. Roche
concerning the $10,000 robbery near
Siege yesterday, when they were re
lieved by highwaymen of money in
transit from the Central Bank to the
Bank of Richmond, was obtained to

The residence commands an unob

bery. It is south and a bit west of
the cut at the Southern Pacific cross
ing where Daly and Roche were held
up. .From the upper windows of the
hirth side of the Ells' home one can
look straightaway across the open
fields to the cut. From this point of
vantage Miss Perry saw the hold-up, a
witness all the more valuable because
she was in no wise acquainted with
the persons involved, and until after
news of the robbery had been taken to
her was not absolutely positive as to
what was going on', although she sus
pected crime of some sort. â¢ -'â¢ â¢â¢

Miss Perry went to the upstairs
windows yesterday morning, intending
to use the glasses to see whether the
track gangs were working on the
road. As she peered through the j
lenses her eyes caught .i horse and
buggy tied to a fence at the west side
of the railroad crossing^ embankment-
Then she noticed the movement of
two men. She saw the fence where
a board had been removed so that
Daly and â¢ Roche could climb through
into the incloseure where they were
bound, gagged and blindfolded. Miss
Perry watched the movements of. the
highwaymen. She saw one of them
drop down the embankment and dis
appear in the direction' of the wil
lows, where Daly saw a hor?e and
buggy tied. Her glasses brought the
second robber into view as he climbed
into Daly's buggy and drove off
through the railroad cut and on rap
idly down Potrero avenue toward
San Pablo road. She saw the second
buggy emerge from Railroad avenue
and move along behind tire first one,
the Btouter of the two robbers driv
ing the second ri&. . .-*â¦:;â Â».
Unable at the time to fathom the*
mysterious movements, Miss Perry
was further engaged by noticing the
actions of Daly and Roche as they
â¢were freed from their bonds after the |
robbers^ departed. These actlpns Miss
Perry "saw and described later identi
cally a* the two robbed men told
them. The young woman.- watched
Roche as he dragged himself to his
feet and went to Daly's rescue. She
saw Roche when he stood and looked
about furtively. over the embankment,
just before she noticed him untying
Daly. She 'saw both men climb oul
into the road and hasten across Po
trero avenue, losing them as they ap
parently neared the cypress hedge at
WV H. Johnson's home on the ave
nue.
Though at the time Miss Perry knew
nothing about the identity of the vic
tims, she gave such minute descrip
tions of Daly and Roche's appearance
that there was no mistaking them nor
confusing them with the two highway
men.
''* TEL.L.S TALE TO MOTHER.

and the two men were beyond her vis

been a witness to a crime. To her
mother she immediately reported what
I she had viewed. The two women were
at a loss how to act. They waited un
til an employe at the cap works
reached the house about noon and to
him Miss Perry said she believed there
had been some sort of a robbery at the
Southern Pacific crossing. The caller
confirmed her suspicions by telling the
girl of the hold-up.
Superintendent Ells had gone to Mar
tinez on the 10:20 morning train from
Stege. His absence left the women in
doubt an to further procedure. They
did not want to make undue notoriety
arts Miss Perry's astonishing experi
ence. But last night as soon as As
semblyman Ells returned home he ad
vised immediate communication with
the authorities. Deputy Sheriff Bou
quet was notified and in turn Sheriff
Yeale was apprised. To-day the Sher
iff went to the Ells place and from
Misp Perry's lips heard the remarkable
narrative. As she detailed the circum
stances, her minute descriptions tally
ing as closely as her report of the
scene before her eyes, Sheriff Veale
was astounded- J
Miss Perry was reluctant to talk
ab;iut the experience. She said her only
purpose in revealing it was to help the
authorities and to verify what she
knew from her own eyes to be the ab
solute truth of Daly and Roche's state
ments. In recounting the oircum-
Staacea to-day at the Ells home, Miss
Perry paid:
The first objects that attracted my
attention were the horse and buggy
that stood tied to the fence in the road
across the railroad tracks. I thought
that was a queer place to leave a rig.
Then 1 noticed a tall man with a rifle
moving about as if he were directing
the other three men. The tall man
seemed to be wearing some kind of a
n,a.Â«k over his face. I saw the tall man
and a stout man go into the open space
ami walk rapidly behind two other
m^n. one of whom wore a light brown
coat (Daly). Then the tall man ap
parently directed the use of ropes or
something of that sort with the man
I .since know to be Daly. The man I
have learned to be Roche was not in
Fisrht. He had been tied and was ly
ing out of view In the grass.
' I saw the tall masked man carrying
a rifle ot a long stick drop down the
railroad embankment opposite the tele
graph pole, where Daly and Roche
were bound. The tall robber walked
along the railroad track. It seemed to
me then as if something wrong was
intended on the tracks. The thought
of train wreckers, strikers or something
of thru sort flashed through my mind.
Mr. Ells had left to go on the train,
which departed from Stege while I was
looking at the men in the field. The
man on the track disappeared from
my view.
I'RGKS HORSE TO SPKED.
"Then the second robber, the stout
man. walked out from the embankment
and hurried over to the buggy (Daly's,
that contained the coin). He untied the
jumped in and turned around
so quickly that the rig nearly upcet.
1 saw it half lip over. As soon as he
had the horse headed toward San Pablo
road he drove hard. The man was
sitting forward on the seat and acted
as if he were urging the horse as hard
as he could. The second buggy ap
peared in view very soon from out of
Railroad avenue. The man in this
buggy I recognized as the one who had
â ori down the railroad embankment
and had disappeared up the track.
With what I had seen then and
what followed I imagined it was a
horse-stealing affair.
Shortly after the two buggies dis
appeared, keeping my glasses on the
spot. I saw the man Roche wriggling
about in a half-raised 'posture. Pretty
quickly he rose to his feet and I noticed
he was working his hands back and
forth. He seemed to be loosening
ropes. This man looked around and
then went over to his companion, who
was Daly, because he wore a light
brown overcoat. The first man I could
easily make out unfastening ropes or
something of that sort. The two imen
walked out of the enclosure quickly and
then started to run. I next saw them
running down Potrero avenue, and
there lost sight of them.
"I wanted to call my mother, but I
was so Interested in the sight that I
did not stop to get her upstairs
"I was puzzled and perplexed over
what I had seen, not knowing what to
do. I was sure some crime had been
committed. If Mr. Ells had been at
home he could have helped me out.
When he did return mv mother
and myself let him decide what should
be done- As soon as the authorities
were informed I felt relieved. It was
almost ghostly, this experience, and I
must confess it upset me quite a hit."
Assemblyman Ells, and Mrs. Perry
supplemented the young woman's story
with confirmatory details.
SEARCH FOR HIDDEN GOL-D.
The effect of Miss Perry's addition
to the evidence is to settle definitely
the fact that there were two rigs con
cerned. That the robbers drove away
singly and took the San Pablo road
back as far as Hopkins street, West
Berkeley, hat? been established fey other
witnesses who saw the* men driving
through the road bound toward Berke
ley. The finding of Daly's buggy and
the $1000 in it at Addison and Sacra -
, mento streets is further proof. Having
â¢ reached that point. Sheriff Veale, with
! the police of Berkeley and Oakland,
i and Sheriff Frank Barnet's men, have
â¢ been scouring the country to-day in
| search of the second buggy. Miss
i Perry describes it as a sort of cheap
i appearing vehicle, drawn by a light
j colored horse. Others style it a sort of
business buggy, without a top, with
! yellow wheels and black striped light
i body. The horse's color has been
described as ranging from sorrel to
I roan.
Through Berkeley, all over the Con
tra Costa hills, into every corner of
the country round about the scene of
Urn robbery, the searching parties of
- ffloen have gone to-day. Sheriff
Wale started early this morning with
Roche for a guide, and covered every
; foot of the ground Just as Roche and
: Daly covered it yesterday up to the
! lla<-e of the robbery. After twenty -

Identify and find the robbers. What
we shall accomplish in that direction I
am not prepared to say. I am hopeful
that some of the many leads upon
which we are working will pan out.
We think we have a fair identification

are. In the course of a few days I
hope developments will justify the lines
upon which we are working."

FACULTY MEN
HEAR BULKELEY
Former Yell Leader of Uni
versity Appears Before
Professors of the College
DECISION IS RESERVED
Academic Council Ready to
Receive Report Which Is
to Settle Man's Fate
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, March 21.
Lewis E. Bulkeley, the former yell
leader of the university, who escaped
prosecution on a criminal charge by
wedding Corinne Barry a fortnight ago,
appeared before the students' affairs
committee of the faculty yesterday, he
being now under suspension, with the
possibility of expulsion from the uni
versity as his fate at the hands of the
college authorities.
Professor Cory, chairman of the fac
ulty committee which listened to Bulk
eley's story, declined to say what
transpired at the secret session, where
Bulkeley sat as a witness and the fac
ulty members as inquisitors,
"You will have to see Mr. Bulkeley
for an account of the proceedings,"
said Professor Cory after the session
was at an end.
Being asked what would be the
course pursued by the committee so
far as its routine method of procedure
was concerned, Professor Cory said
that the faculty committee would
make its report of what Bulkeley had
said, and recommend to the academio
council, which meets to-morrow after
noon, what action it thinks should be
taken in the matter.
Bulkeley is in town, after absenting
himself for days, following the cere
mony which made him and Corinne
Barry husband and wife. He retains his
apartments at the Brasfleld Inn, but
declines to discuss his case in any
way.
Bulkeley's wife is at a sanitarium
with her mother, where she went a
week ago, after her marriage. The
Barry home on Shattuck avenue is de
serted. The exact whereabouts of the
mother and her daughter has not been
divulged by the family.
WOMAN'S ERRATIC ANSWER
SHAKES FAITH OF COUNSEL
Attorney Johnson Tries to Retire
From Mrs. Barrio's Case, but
Court Dissuades Him.
OAKLAND, March 21. â The erratic
testimony of Mrs. Eliza A. Barrie, who
is engaged in fighting a divorce suit
brought against her by Alexander A.
Barrie of Berkeley, nearly lost her
counsel, H. Digby Johnson, this after
noon. She surprised him by her re
ply to a question and he at once ten
dered his resignation to the court and
said that he wanted nothing more to
do with the case. Judge Ellsworth,
however, talked him out of retiring.
Attorney Johnson has been making a
hard flght for his client, under the
impression that she was an abused
woman. In a former trial of the case
Judge Ogden stated that It was his be
lief that she was not in her right mind
and this afternoon in answer to a
question as to her reason for not
wishing to have her niece and nephew
live with her she said it was because
she believed they would poison her.
There was nothing: to warrant this.
Johnson was astonished, and, inter
rupting his client, who went on to
make a rambling statement, said:
"Tour Honor, I withdraw from the
case. I wish to have nothing more
to do with it."

San Pablo evenue, was arrested to-day
on a charge of battery preferred by
pretty Miss Rita Bevert, who lives at
943 Pine street. The young woman
says that on last Saturday night while
on her way from San Francisco she
met Jackson, who was accompanied by
Miss Maud Randlett. Jackson's com
panion is alleged to have made several
Insulting remarks and when Miss
Bevert retaliated in kind Jackson
slapped her face.
Miss Bevert says that in the strug
gle she lost her purse and watch and
she accuses the young man of having
taken these articles. Jacksol vigor
ously denies having slapped the young
woman and says he knows nothing
about her valuables. Soon after his
arrest he was released on bail.

Little credence is given by the local

told by Earl Roy Bodine, who yester
day surrendered to the Oakland police
and confessed that eight years ago
he had killed a man in Fort Fairfleld,
Me., and thrown the body into the

Aroostook County of any such crime
as that described by Bodine. and that
no one can be found who ever heard
of the disappearance of any one an
swering the description of the alleged
victim.
Investigation by the police has re
sulted in bringing to light several
facts about Bodine, who seems to be
afflicted with a form of religious mania.
A year ago he was numbered among
the converts of a Peniel mission in San
Francisco, and three months ago he
was once more converted in this city,
being baptized by a German minister
at Piedmont Baths.
Chief of Police Hodgklns said to
night that he had not yet heard from
the Fort Fairfleld authorities, but
would hold Bodine until he received
a reply to his communication.
FAIRFIELD, Me., March 21.â Little
information was obtainable to-day re
garding an alleged crime >in the vi
cinity of Port Fairfleld eight years
ago, which Earl Bodine is said to have
confessed to the Oakland city police
after asserting that he had been con
verted by evangelists. Local and
county officials failed to recall such
case and discredit the "confession."
There was, however, an Impression
that the body of a young man was
recovered from the Aroostook River
about |hat time.

This bit of Information was onÂ« of the
"Glimpses of Llvins Writers." that was given
in rhyme by Mrs. Elizabeth Dow Yorker to
day at the Ebell reception. She took a peck
at every writer of recent distinction, from
Jack London down to Ebell's own modest

enjoyed by the throng of women that filled
the clubrooms to the doore.
Though St. Patrick's day 1b now well back

of honoring the holy man. who was Wuch a

the mass of decorative gre^n, the Stars and

KEEP THE COIN
AT UNIVERSITY
Opposition Thus Replies
to Plan Which Provides
Help for the Japanese
FOOTBALL 31 AN TO AID
Captain Force on One Side
of Fight, With Editor
Loeb at Opposite End
Berkeley Office San Francisco Cair,
2148 Center Street. March 21.
The proposed contribution of $2500
by the University of California for the
building of dormitories which Chris
tian Japanese students may usÂ« in
schools at Kioto, Japan, haa become a
bone ot contention at the university
which threatens to take on the impor
tance of an international complication
before it is settled.
The Y. M. C. A. leaders at the uni
versity are back of the project, it hav
ing been fathered by them. Against the
scheme to get the big contribution
from the university folk are a number
of prominent college leaders, who won a
notable addition to their ranks to-day
in J. P. Loeb, editor of the Daily Call
fornian. Loeb is a power, and his edi
torial columns to-day bristle with ar
guments calculated to throw water on
the plan to build dormitories for the
Japanese In Japan.
On the other side, however, looms up
large the gigantic figure of James A.
Force, captain of the varsity football
team, who has given his official sanc
tion to the Y. M. C. A. project.
LOEB'S VIEWS.
Loeb declares that it ought to be
stated at once whether it is proposed
to make the $2500 contribution an offi
cial donation or whether it is to be a
private benefaction. Loeb couches his
argument Hi the following words:
The status of the movement is not clear. If
it is an unofficial and private enterprise, not
undertaken in the name of the university, the
question Is one of private opinion, not a mat
ter of a public nature which is to be taken up
by the students as members of the university.
Against the Japanese hostel fund, as a private
charity, organized by individual students ana
supported by private contributions, we have
nothing to say. But if the plan Is to have the
students of the University of California mako
a gift to the University of Kioto, the only
proper way to work is through the executive
committee. Theoretically, perhaps, it is more
beautiful to give freely to the distant Oriental
than to ourselves, or to people of our own
State or niUton. This is a matter of private
conviction, not to be affected by argument or
petitions. But th* student body must put a
practical limit to its altruism, and should not
officially countenance any effort which will take
a large sum of money out of Its reach and
make even more difficult the task of raising
funds for the improvement of California or the
life of her students.
Captain Force's views on the subject
are as follows:
I am In sympathy with California's Japan
ese enterprise. The movement undertaken by
our undergraduates, alumni and professors is
one of the hugest altruistic undertakings ever
presented to the student body. Every student
subscribing to thts fund will certainly be do-
Ing a worthy act toward his university.
A. A. Bullock, a strong supporter of
the dormitory idea, has put himself on
record with the following explanation:
We do not consider that this is a charity
any more than the Cecil Rhodes scholarships
are. Neither can It be classed aa missionary
In the narrow sense, because Its avowed pur
pose is not to Christianize but primarily to
rut before that great student body the one
thing they need â a pure, moral home.

CANAL CRITIC
Writes to the President in
Regard to the Charges
Made by Dr. C. A. L. Reed
K> REARRANGE BOARD
Secretary Notifies the Chief
Kxecutive of a New Plan
for Isthmian Commission
WASHINGTON. March 21.âSecre
tary Taft to-day made public a letter
which he has written to the President,
concerning complaints made by Dr. C
... L. R*ed regarding the work of the
Ifthmtan Canal Commission. In the
Oi ursr- of his l<ntor Secretary Taft said:
1 herewith transmit the answer of the com
mission to the charges contained in the report
of Dr. C. A. L. Reed to me as to th sanitary
provisions made by the Isthmian CanaJ Com
mission on the Isthmus. I think that a reading
of the two documents will show what, indeed,
was apparent on the face of Dr. Reed's state
dent â that his charges against the comraifsion
were biased and controversial, and not writ
ten In the judicial spirit that inspires confi
dence In their justice and accuracy.
Dr. Reed visited the Istnmus at my request
to act ac an assessor of Una upon a commis
sion provided by the treaty between Panama
and the United States, but as be was the head
of the American Medical Association. it seemed
to me an opportunity on his return to secure
information from one skilled In his profession
as to the existing conditions upon the Isthmus.
In response to my queries lie was bo emphatic
and so detailed in his charges that I asked
him to make his statement in writing, which
he ilid upon the same nay l>y the tif< of a
stenographtr. Ii Is probable that had he taken
more time he would have tÂ«en more measured
in his criticism, lers extreme in his statements
â md less fliri ant in his references to the action
rf the commission. The report of Dr. Reed
was published without my knowledge or con
cent.
CAIM OF TIIK DELAYS.
The reply of the commission seems to show
that a large [.art of the plans and the action
cf ll:c commission, which Dr. Reed criticizes,
was fully concurred in and agreed to by Colo
nel Gorgas and the other medical officers in
:he employ of the commission. It Is doubtless
true that ( '..lone 1 Gorgas and his staff believed
that It would be wiser to give them an entirely
free hand in the matter t>t ordering construc
tion supplies and the employment of subordi
nates. It io quite probable that had the ap
proval of the commission in the matter of or
dering construction supplies been dispensed
with there would have been fewer delays and
less complaint en this account, but In the ex
penditure, of such larse sums as were neces
sary for the organization or the sanitary sys
tem and the purchase of supplies, i; may well
be doubted whether the commission would have
been discharging its duty in withholding such
Bopervlaory control.
It is doubtless true that there have been
undue- delays in the furnishing cf what was
needed for sanitary purposes on the Isthmus,
but I venture to think that It is due rather to
the inherent clumsiness of the commission as
*n executive body than the willful or non
suer.tion of any member of that body. There
raust be me restraint for purposes of econ
omy upon expenditures by an executive who
baa in mind the total expenditures and obli
gations being incurred. .
The remedy for the delays which may have
occurred here, it seems to me, are to be found
in a rearrangement of the commission with a
new distribution of powers and the conferring
ci the executive on one, or at the most not
more than three membeis or the commission,
with a general supervisory and confirmatory
pewer in the commission as a body.
With your permission I will submit in a day
â  : the better carrying on of the

RAILROAD, WHO IS FAVORED Hi' PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT FOR THE >
HEAD OF THE PROPOSED NEW PANAMA CANAL BOARD.
WASHINGTON. March 21.âQues
tions relating to the isthmian canal
end the reorganization of the Canal
Commission occupied much of the at
tention of the Cabinet at to-day's
meeting. No definite announcement
was made at the conclusion of the
meeting regarding the canal questions
beyond that a statement on the de
cision? reached will be made prior to
the President's departure on his South
western trip. It is stated that the
name of Horace G. Burt, former presi
dent of the Union Pacific Railroad, is
under consideration for the position of
executive head of the commission, but
it has not been decided yet whether he
will accept the place.
His appointment would interfere In
no respect with the retention at the
head of the engineering work of the
present chief engineer. Wallace, who,
assisted by probably two other engi
neers, will have control of the practi
cal engineering of the canal construc
tion, it iÂ« the desire of the President
and of Secretary Taft to make Burt
the business head of the canal organi
sation and build up around him such
an organization as he would require to
accomplish the great work he would
undertake as the head of the commis
sion. His salary, it is intimated, will
not exceed 525,000 a year.
Some details of the reorganization of
the commission remain yet to be
worked out. It has not been determined
definitely whether the President has
authority to reduce the number of the
Commissioners, but if it should be de
rided that he has, the number will be
reduced. It is said to be not unlikely
that William Barclay Parsons and
William H. Burr, two of the engineers
n'>w members of the commission, will
be retained as assistants to Engineer
Wallace. In ether respects the com
mission's personnel will be changed en
tirely.

Chicago Company's Position Substan-

Being Damaged.
CHICAGO. March 21.â Careful analy
sis to-day of the ordinance depriving
the City Railway Company of any
franchise rights to the streets of Chi
cago appears to show that the com
pany's position, Instead of being dam
aged, is substantially improved. The
ordinance contains a clause that the
executive officers of the municipality
are to take no steps to interfere with
the operation of the company's street
car system pending demonstration of
the respective rights of the company
and city in the courts.
The case, it is said, will go to the
Supreme Court of the United States.
A final decision in the litigation is not
expected within two years. Mean
while, the company has a virtual fran
chise through the very measure that
ostensibly is a forfeiture.

open meeting in the rooms of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce to
morrow afternoon before Commissioner
J. L. Bristow, who has come to the
Pacific Coast to get all the Information

BALFOUR ANNOUNCES
CHANGE OF ATTITUDE
Hereafter Resolutions Made
to Commit Government
Upon the Fiscal Ques
tion Will Not Be Opposed
LONDON, March 21.â The Cabinet
meeting to-day discussed the fiscal
situation in the House of Commons and
decided that in future the Government
will not use pressure upon its follow
ers in regard to the opposition resolu
tions framed to commit the Govern
ment on the fiscal question. As a re
sult, the resolution announced for the
night of March 22, expressing the op
position of the House to a tax on im
ported manufactured articles, probably
will be carried by a comfortable ma
joiity, but the opposition will be unab.e
to reap more than an indirect political
benefit.
The decision of the Cabinet was
backed by Joseph Chamberlain's fol
lowers to-night, when at a meeting of
seventy-eight Unionist tariff reform
ers it was decided not to participate in
the debates or divisions on the resolu
tion, the vote on which, howover, will
be interesting because it will be a "go
as you please."
The Government having decided that
the fiscal question is not a critical
party issue, whips will not be sent out.
A majority for the resolution will not
be considered a defeat for the Govern
ment, whose supporters express them
selves as having rejected, on March 8,
the resolution declaring that, in the
opinion of the House, permanent unity
of the British empire could not be
obtained through a system of prefer
ential duties based on protective taxa
tion of food.
This move on the part of Premier
Balfour is the political sensation of the
hour and is being hailed with great
joy by free traders, who claim that it
is a definite desertion of Chamberlain
by his former Cabinet associates.
BRITAIN NEEDS
GREATER NAVY
Viscount Goschen Says the
Two-Power Standard Is
No Longer Applicable
LONDON, March 21 â In the House
of Lords this evening the nevy ex
penditure was lengthily discussed on
the call of the Liberal leader, Earl
Spencer, for papers regarding the
naval programme. He said he did not
desire to condemn the Government, but
he wanted an explanation of the plans
involving the withdrawal of such a
large number of vessels from the list
of vessels which could be commissioned
for active service and the reasons for
the increased expenditure since 1894
1905.
Viscount Goschen justified the vast
increase in the last fifteen years. He
said the two-power standard was no
longer applicable. One thing had been
strongly brought out by the Russo-
Japanese warâ namely, the difficulties
which might arise with neutrals, and
the necessity of maintaining an atti
tude of dignity and power thereto.
Viscount Goschen said he did not
think there was any harm in discussing
these questions- Chancellor yon Bulow
was very candid occasionally in re
gard to European politics. Continuing,
Viscount Goschen said when any pow
er with twelve battleships was ready
within 100 miles of the English coast,
that was the power which must be
considered side by side with prepara
tions to meet any two powers with
whom Great Britain might have to
deal.
Referring to the loss of Russian war
ships. Viscount Goschen said it was
simply a question of Russia giving
orders to great establishments outside
of Russia for a renewal of her navy.
He did not think the fact that Russia
had lost five battleships was a circum
stance sufficient to justify the arrest
of Great Britain's ship building pro
gramme.
The First Lord of the Admiralty, the
Earl of Selborne, said the Increased ex
penditure was due to the fact that the
whole naval aspect of the world, East
and West, had changed. Within the
past thirteen years new navies had
sprung up. Russia had recently suf
fered great losses, but the fleet of
Japan had come into existence;
America and Germany had evolved
navies of equal strength and efficiency,
while the great French navy had main
tained Its efficiency. Great Britain was
not forcing the pace In ship building,
but was merely taking into account
what other nations were doing and a
two and possibly three power standard
must be maintained.
Lord Selborne, in concluding, pointed
out that in the West Indies the whole
naval strategical situation had under
gone a complete revolution since the
Carnarvon Commission sat. owing to
the birth of the American navy.
At Lord Selborne's request Lord
Spencer withdrew his motion for pa
pers.

Was Owner of Revolver

Claims to Have Proof That
the Bookmaker Was Armed
While at Sheepshead Bay
Special D!M>atch to The CaJL
NEW YORK, March 21.â "Nan" Pat- I
terson, who has been in the Tombs i
since last June, charged with the mur- !
der of "Caesar" Young, the California j
bookmaker, declared to-day that if she ;
were ever put on trial again she would \
surely be acquitted. She said this !
after a conference with her lawyer, i
Daniel O'Reil!;-, who had told her of
new evidence discovered, which, in his
opinion, tended to show that Young
committed suicide. According to
O'Reilly the defense will be able to
prove these facts, not brought out at
the first trial: â¢
Firstâ That "Caesar" Young was the
owner of a 32-caliber revolver.
Secondâ That he had such a revolver
in his possession on June 3 while at
the Sheepshead Bay racetrack. The al
leged murder occurred on June 4.
Thirdâ That "Caesar" Young, on the
afternoon of June 3 took a pistol away
from his wife.
Fourthâ That Mrs. Young owned a
32-caliber revolver. - i
Fifthâ That in "Caesar" Youngs
trunk, sent to England on the morn
ing of the shooting and afterward re
turned to this country, were found a
large number of 32-callber revolver
cartridges.
Besides this, O'Reilly says that new
witnesses have been found who will
swear that J. Morgan Smith, "Nan"
Patterson and her sister left the
Sheepshead Bay racetrack on the very
last train and after Young's racing
partner had left the track.
"If "Nan* Patterson is ever placed
on trial again â and I have very serious
doubts that she will be," said O'Reilly,
"we shall be able to prove, even to
the satisfaction of Rand, the Assistant
District Attorney, that Young commit
ted suicide. 'Nan' never had this pistol
in her possession. It was Young's re
volver and he had It not only that
morning when he went to meet her,
but also the day before."
At the District Attorney's office to
day it was not denied that Mrs. Young
owned a 32-caliber revolver.

Congregat ional Ministers
Oppose Acceptance of Biff
Gift From Rockefeller
BOSTON, March f âCongregational
ministers representing Boston and
various sections of New England have
forwarded to the American Board of
Commissioners for Foreign Missions
a protest against the acceptance by
the board of a gift of $100,000 from
John D. Rockefeller. The petition,
which was prepared by- a committee
chosen at a meeting of the clergymen,
protests against the acceptance of the
gift on the ground that the Standard
Oil Company, of which Rockefeller is
the head, "stands before the public
under repeated and recent formidable
indictments in specific terms for
methods which are morally iniquitous
and socially destructive." and that "the
acceptance of such a gift involves the
constituents of the board in a relation
implying honor toward the donor and
subjects the board to the charge of
ignoring the moral issues involved."
In conclusion, the protest says:
We, the undersigned, therefore protest
against the action by which our church may
even seem to be compromised and we plead
with the officers of the board to decline the
gift or to return It If It has been accepted.
Among the signers are Daniel Evans,

the Postofflce Department which is to
the effect that during the present ad

In effect, this policy, which emanated

PARIS, March 21.â The Chamber of
Deputies to-day Jsegan the debate on
the Government's bill providing for tha
separation of church and State. A
large crowd was present and Intense
Interest was shown in the proceedings.
The debate began with the motion of
Georges Berry (Conservative) deferring
the subject until after the general elec
tions of 1906. and the motion of the
Abbe Gayraud (Catholic Republican) to
refer the question to a parliamentary
question commission.
Berry's motion was defeated by 343
to 40 votes and by a vote of 388 to IS2
the chamber decided not to accept Abbe
Gayraud's motion.
Abbe Gayraud contended that the
suppression of the budget of public
worship amounted to robbery. It was.
h^> said, a breach of the 1739 engage
ment. The courts could compel Cath
olics to submit to the law. but they
would never recognize its Justice. If

THE PRESIDENT AND THE RAILWAYS.
CO.\ ! adjourned without action upon the enlargement of
powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission over the
- charged by transportation companies. This throws the
Into the next Congress, which is fresher from the people and
ed a: the same polls as the President. This fact should be
â¢rood for a bond of sympathy between it and the executive. If such
â¢ dst and shall lead to a conservative treatment in line
with \hv President's reasonable recommendations, all parties to the
iK.-.efited and none will be harmed.
The .'Dponemc Â«,f the President are mistaken in treating his
a revolutionary novelty. Instead of being that, the right
â¢n of transportation rates is well settled in an un
licial decision*. Hardly any iudicable question has
r outm in as great a variety of shapes as this. For
it was held that railway corporations were subject only to
was written in their franchises. Chancellor Wahvorth held
â he Legislatures may from time to time regulate the use of

iawf â  they have deprived themselves of thai power
iiv .-1 legislative contract with the owners of the road." Then arose
the question "f the existence of a legislative finality and of the
â¢ Legislai bind all of its successors by a legis
<-â¢ contra
That question was decided against such right. Justice Swayne
held â¢ such cases "The rule of construction is that it shall

able <ioubi is to be resolved adversely. Nothing is to be taken as
â¢ ied bat what is riven in unmistakable terms, or by an itnpli
ialh dear. Silence is negation and doubt is fatal to the
This doctrine is vital to the public welfare. It is axiomatic
iii the jurisprudence of this court.'" So the rule stated by < ireenleaf
came bo be settled that "Any act of the Legislature disabling itself
Mkn the future exercise of powers intrusted to it for the public good
is void, being in effect â  covenant to desert its paramount duty to
'he people."
In wmt cases that have been adjudicated the franchise did not
give the railroad the right to make any charge at all. As
h cases the courts properly held the right to make a charge
lied, a*- an essential feature of the enterprise, but at the
-ame time the right oi the State to control the rate of charge was
Franchisee containing the covenant that the railway
-hall have the riglu "to transport all articles usually carried on rail
ami to charge and receive therefor such tolls and freights as
â¢Â»hall be for the interest of the corporation." were construed by the
mesa that rates and tolls must be reasonable, or the public
power to make them so would be invoked. In the case of Wells,
& Co. vs. the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, the
railroad took refuge behind its franchise, which gave it the power to
collect such 'tolls or freights as the corporation itself may prescribe."
Heady held this to mean only the grant of a right to make
â¢liable charges and take reasonable tolls.
all question* arising in the franchise itself have been settled
ir favor of the permanence and continuance and inalienability of the
â  jgbt of public regulation of rates. Equally clear is the adjudication
subject of rebates. In the Camden and Amboy case the Su
preme Court of the United States said. "The rate must be a stipu
lated, reasonable and uniform toll." and that if the road does not so
maintain it- charges, then it ceases to be a highway, and the legis
lative acts giving it its very existence are unconstitutional and void.
When tolls and rates are affected by a rebate they are not reasonable
and uniform, and the offender incurs serious penalties, beyond those
nxed in the anti-trust and interstate commerce laws. The return of
franchises to the State for violation of their written or implied con
ns \< clearly a legal method.
In the evolution of the subject the courts have not been un
fill of the right of railroad property to the protection of the law.
i hc\ have decided that rate-making is a judicial and not a legislative
â¢ r executive function, and that n<> matter whether rates are made
by public authority or by the corporations, they are subject to due
' law. which is the judicial process only.
In the foregoing it is made plain that the policy of the President
it conservative in respect both to the rights of property and the in
â r'-eMs of the public. It should also be plain to all interests con
d that if the question is not settled by the next Congress, it is
sure to go before the people in the next Congressional election, when
here will be furnished scope for all sorts of radical propositions.
which will cloud the issue and identify it more or less with all sorts
oi Socialistic proposition*.
These considerations should impress upon Congress the extreme
-bility of leaving no provocation for socialism to feed upon.
There is nothing so intricate in the matter as to be the despair of
statesmanship. The railroad people will doubtless see their interest
;n; n co-operation with the President, rather than in stubbornly oppos
'he only solution possible.
JOHN HAY'S ILLNESS.
THE whole country hears with profound sorrow of the precarious
condition of the health of Secretary Hay. He has had a longer
and more varied experience in public life and contact with the
affairs of hi? country than any other man now in official position. As
a younp man he went to Washington as the private secretary of
President Lincoln, and was in intimate touch with all of the tragic
; dents of the Civil War. Later he was Minister to Great Britain
1 then became Secretary of State. In that position all of his ex
->nce. his just and well balanced mind, his stalwart Americanism
?.nd biÂ« love of truth and justice have made him the greatest, fairest
tnd best diplomat the world ever saw.
He was the President's private secretary when Lincoln was as
<-Â«inated. and he was Secretary of State when McKinley was assas
sinated, an experience that no other statesman has had, and, consid
ng his kindly heart and sympathetic nature, one that might well
c a harmful impress upon his physique.
Tfr haÂ« tavght the world a new diplomacy, and has taken out
that nvofessi ->n its craft and cunning, and has substituted therefor
nor and truthfulness and justice. So widely has this impression
gone that other nations are compelled to recognize it, so that it can
be no longer said that an Embassador is a man sent abroad to lie

THK SAX FRAN CISCO' CVLL. WEDNESDAY. MARCH 2J, 1905.
THE PLIGHT OF CAPTAIN
MARSHALL.
MARTHA M'CULLOCH-WILLIAMS
IF An iK- Maria Jones had been born
a beauty, or even moderately pretty,
this story would not have to be
written. With a snub nose, hair,
eyes and complexion of the same
piece, and no figure to speak of, even
â  robust vanity cannot deceive. Anne
Maria's vanit} was not robust. How
should it be w hen she had a beautiful
sister, upon whom the family hopes
and the family expenditures equahy
centered? But Anne Maria had under
standing. Since she could not be or
namental she resolved to be useful.
Moreover, she had a palate rare in
womankind, and a deft way in the
kitchen that was worth a lot of looks.
You begin to perceive the relation
of things. If she had been a beauty
she wouldn't have been a cook. And
then Captain Josephus Marshall â but
stories snould be told as they happen.
Captain Josephus was a bachelor, rich
and cranky, who had two cares in
lift â keeping his indigestion and his
freedom. To say that he was nice
over his eating is putting it quite too
mildly. It was the same regarding his
single- estate. He thought every girl
who was even civil to him had visions
of dower or alimony floating through
her head. And he was firmly resolved
never to marry; also quite as firmly
resolved that his nephew, Alonzo,
should not live a bachelor, nor marry
any wife save one of the Captain's
<hooslng.
Judge Jones, Anne Maria's father,
had been at college with the Captain.
Naturally when a business deal
brought the Captain to the Judge's
town he was made very welcome in
the Jones home. Naturally, also,
Alonzo. who came along, went down
before Louella. the beauty. Then the
Captain called him names, and sent
him packing, saying gruffly: "If you
want my money to go to charity just
many anything named Jones."
When Louella heard that she tossed
her head and went on a long visit to
her city aunt. Anne Maria stayed at
home, keeping very much out of the
Captain's way, but getting up such
dishes for him as he had not tasted
since his mother died. Good feeding
is held to breed good temper, but the
Captain must have been born to set
rule and proverbs at defiance. The
fatter he got the crankier he sho-wed
himself to be. Indeed, Judge Jones
gave Anne Maria a caution at the end
of the third fortnight, saying: "If you
feed up that old wretch much more
there'll be no doing business with him.
As matters stand, this whole thing
hinges on his consent â and yesterday
he let us know in full board that unless
he has his own way in everything, from
the weight of the rails to the names
of the stations, the railroad will never
be built. The final meeting when all
must be decided comes off two, days
hence. If only you could make the
<'aptain ill â too ill to be in his seat â
but really I don't believe it is possible.
He has the stomach of an ostrich, al
though he talks dyspepsia half the
GETTING RICH SLOWLY.
Ordinarily a great fortune is built
up like a stone wall â a stone at a
time, says the Troy Pres.Â«. The young
man who declines to lay the first
ptone, because it com^s po far short of
a wall, â will never makf progress in
financial masonry. An immense pro
portion of the people of this country
live up to their incomes, laying aside
nothing for the traditional rainy day.
Because they cannot save $1000 in a
bunch they save nothing. The great
est financial kings of the world have
not been above taking care of the pen
nies even. The great financial Institu
tions look after even the fractions of
pennies.
Beware of the married man who ad
â¢ vises a bachelor to get married. He
l may be trying to get even.

FASHION'S MIRROR
A modish long coat costume for street and zvalking. It is

"Dried peaoh pies!" the cap
tnin mumbled.
time."
Anne Maria sighed, then smiled, but
said nothing. She studied half the
night, and next morning said privately
to the Judge: "Don't come home to
lunch, fatherâ l shall send something
to the office. And be sure you keep the
Captain to eat with you." Then she
disappeared in the direction of the
kitchen, smiling oddly, and also sighing
the least bit in the world.
"What have we here? As I live,
fried pies! Jerusalem, how my mouth
waters! I can eat an acre of 'em any
day!" the Captain cried, as toward
one o'clock that day Judge Jones threw
back the damask cover of the laden
tray that had Just been set on top of
his big desk. "And I'm hungry as a
wolf! This is luck!" the Captain went
on, seizing ane of the rich brown greasy
half-moons and popping the end of it
into his mouth. It came away with a
clean semi-circular cut something less
than four inches across. "Dried peach
pies!" the Captain mumbled ecstatic
ally, chewing hard. "Sun-dried peaches,
ton. Where, where did you find 'em,
Jones? Never tasted anything so good
in all my life."
"You must ask the women," the
Judge said, chuckling behind his hand
BOBBIE ON EDITORS.
Thfre arp 3 kinds of editors:
1. boss editors.
2. other editors.
3. spoarting editors.
I would like to be the spoarting editor
beekause he gits into all the fights and
hall galms free and the other editors
pay when they go but doan't go thay
aint got time. The boss editor is the
best job for munny. *"
editors is pretty hard to lick they
doant git licked much. Once my Pa
tried to lick a editor but got licked
hicself and came home with a eye all
black and Ma said It serves yu rite
trying to take away the freedom of
the Press âMilwaukee Pentinel.
Some political candidates lost out be
cause Ihpy arÂ° unknown and some bf
cause they are too well known.
â he began to see the method of Anne
Maria's madness. Hospitably he press
ed other things on the Captain, but
without avail- The first pie disap
peared in exactly a minuteâ the second
required a minute and a half. Then
the Judge lost count, though his inter
est was still keen. He smiled affably
when the Captain said, in a conscience
stricken voice:
"God bless me! Jones, I've eaten
every piel Such a pile of them, too!
But you'll forgive me â I don't get 'em
only once in a blue moon. Besides,
after the tuck-out I shan't want any
thing for at least two days."
"You're more than welcome," the
Judge said, hospitably, lighting a cigar
The Captain waved aside a proffered
pipe. "Wouldn't spoil the after-taste <>f
my pies for a fortune," he said. "I'm
going right now to sleep away the
afternoonâ indeed. I feel like sleeping
till to-morrow morning."
Man proposes â sometimes. The Cap
tin slept for three hours, to awake in
agony. Not for naught had he coddled
and cosseted a stomach of these years.
It resented angrily the burden he had
put upon it- Fried pastry had been
nothing to a boy's digestion, but to
eat it with a boy's appetite in late mid
dle age made it quite another thing-
The peaches had been as sweet and
spiced as the pastry was greasy. To
gether they key>t the poor Captain ill
all night long. In the morning he was
weak and wan â so weak the bare
thought of food revolted him. He got
up and staggered about the room, but
found it idle to think of going out.
Then came the Judge to whisk him
away to his house, in spite of the Cap
tain's weak and wavering protests.
"Leave you here! Not much. Ho
tels are dreary places for sick men,"
the Judge said heartily â meaning
quite half he said. And the Captain
found himself established in state in
the Jones' spare room, with Anne Ma
ria flitting noiselessly in and out to
fetch him gruel, or clam broth, or
some other thing he needed but did
not crave.
Thus skillfully encouraged, indiges
tion kept him prisoner three full days.
When he at last got out, it was to find
the railway pact made beyond over
setting. That, however, did not trou
ble him so much as a nearer personal
concern. Alonzo must be told â but
how? There lay the rub. Alonzo
was still sulking afar off â at least the
Captain believed so. Desperately he
decided on heroic measures. After
the decision he took Anne Maria for a
quiet drive â Anne Maria in her best
frock and her most demure smile.
When they came back the Captain
sent Alonzo a dispatch:
"Come home; I have married a
Jones. Help me break it to the old
folks."
The answer was delayed, and the
Captain was fuming when it came. As
he tore it open Anne Maria read over
his shoulder: "Congratulations! So
have I. We will break it to the old
folks together."^ â (Copyright. 1905,

MYSTERY OF HEALTH.
Whenever any one ia released from
a jail or penitentiary after a long sen
tence, we read that while he was in
poor or downright bad health when
he entered he comes out as hearty as
a brick. Yet almost without exception
jails and penitentiaries are unsanitary,
sunless places, with no facilities for
precautions usually taken by those
who wish to get or keep healthy. The
mystery lies in two words â regularity
and diet. The first is perhaps the
more important. Clock-like regu
larity; everything done on the second
and on the same second every day; a
recognition qf the fact that the body ]
is a machine. Then, as a supplement
to this, a simple diet â plain, not too
variedâ enough to eat, but not too |
much. â Saturday Evening Post.

"You mean it kindly, miss," rejoined
the elderly passenger, sitting down

LULU'S SONG
Tells Her She Is ''Squawkin'"
and Leads Her to Jail.
HER VOICE RISES AHEAD OF LARK'S
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"If this gentleman," said Miss Lulu
Newetream, alluding to Patrolman Joy,
"knew the first thing about vooel mu
eic I m pure he would not have sub
jected me to this humiliation."
Her tones were dulcet and her de
meanor modestly firm as she stood be
fore Police Judge Mogan and tapped
a patent-leather toecap with the point
of a white satin parasol. She was
pawned in baby-blue broadcloth, tight
fitting and her red straw hat with
brim looped a la the masculine head
gear of the revolutionary period, blend
ed charmingly with a natural blonde
coiffure. So striking was the ensemble
that the court attaches, a crowded
"pea" and a thronged auditorium had
eyes for nothing else.
The policeman acknowledged that he
was not adept in music appreciation,
and Miss Newstream shot an I-told
you-so glance at the bench. But he
did know enough about concordance of
sound, the officer hastened to aver, to
satisfy him that the defendant was not
manufacturing it when he overhauled
her at 3 o'clock a. in. on lower Pacific
street and told her that if she did not
cease disturbing the peace he would be
compelled by a conscientious fealty to
duty to run her in. She did not cease,
probably because she was intoxicated,
and he did run her in.
"What you actually paid to me."
Miss Newstream remarked, smiling re
provingly at her accuser, "was both
rude and offensive, and with the
Judge's milâ lnn I would like to
quote your exact words."
"If thf-y arc fit for publication," said
his Honor, "let's hear them."

If you don't let up on that squawkin'

the word 'sQuawkin'.' for it struck me
at the time as being both unusual and
expressive. Moreover, it angered meâ
I won't deny that â for my voice had
never before been disparaged, and I'm
sure the air I was humming could not
be justly pronounced discordant by
any one who knows the least thing
about music. So if I did snenk sharp
ly to him it could not be helped."

Dunne for placing a wager in a pool

quiry by the court developed the in
formation that the establishment In

"It seems to me," said his Honor,
"that too much alacrity is sho-wn in
arresting visitors to pool places and
too much neeloct displayed In arresting
those who conduct men places. T wish,
Mr. I'unne. you would tell your cap

journey by a former pupil of hers em
ployed in an educational capacity near
Los Angeles, and after living there
awhile her hostess married and went
away on a bridal tour. Then the de
fendant came to San Francisco and en
gaged an apartment in a fashionable
boarding-house on Eddy street, and
while awaiting a remittance from home
with which to pay her rent she was
dunned and nagged by the landlady
until in a state of semi-insanity she
went to the Emporium and was de
tected in the act of pilfering a case erf
cheap jewelry. Her intention, she says,
was to pawn the stuff, pay the land
lady and make restitution to the Em
porium as soon as her delayed remit
tance arrived.
Since her arrest, about a week ago,
the expected money came, and she Is
at liberty under $200 cash bail. Her
attorney says he cabled to her sisters
and discovered that all her statements
to him anent herself were perfectly
true.
John J. Jones, colored, averred he
had just arrived from Los Angeles and
was seeking a desirable lodging place
when an inquisitive patrolman foiled
his quest by arresting him at 2 o'clock
Sunday morning in the vicinity of Jack
son and Fillmore streets. In his pos
session at the time were a number of
tools used by stonemasons and carpen
ters, and they, he explained, were im
plements of his craft, which was that
of general housebuilder. There was
nothing about either his appearance or
his manner to qualify him for residence
ii. such a dignified neighborhood as
Pacific Heights, for his raiment was
tattered and his lack of conversational
grpee most conspicuous. The police
man suspected he had stolen the tools,
and subsequent investigation confirmed
that suspicion, for they had been taken
from a structure at Webster and Pa
cific streets, to whicl* admittance had
been gained by means of excavating
with a shovel under one of the founda
tion wall*. In presence of Judge Mo
gan the defendant stoutly denied he
had wielded the sh<>-\el.
"De fack am, Jedge, " he said, with
great earnestness. "Ah kimmed from

William A. Schmidt, a Tenth-street
grocer charged with having sold a bot
tle of whisky to an 8-year-old boy,
smiled broadly and remained dumb
when Judge Fritz asked him if he were
guilty, and a prolonged grin was hi 3
only answer to a query as to vrtaether
he was represented by counsel. Then
his face was given a rest by an at
torney standing up and announcing
himself for the defense. Case continued

Bray, a boy with a very bad record,
were arrested one jiight last week on
Stevenson street. Approving smiles
from the cage rewarded Master Quinn's

the dcleentes t>> the Grand Lodge would
be the guests of the association at a
banquet.
The reports >>f the grand officers
were presented in printed form. That
of the grand dictator was read and,
with the others, was referred to the
committee on distribution.
IX GOOI> CONDITION.
From the reports it appears that the
order in this State is in a satisfactory
conditon at his time; that during the
past two years there were less suspen
sions than during the preceding term;
that there were 122 deaths and that
the sum of $221,000 had been paid to
the beneficiaries of deceased members.
There are now forty-one lodges located
in various parts of the State. During
the term five were consolidated and
one went out of existence.
A number of resolutions were pre
sented, and the purpose of these is to
inquire into the feasibility of making
certain provisions for the payment of
assessments by members who during
membership shall have paid into the
order 7 5 per cent of the amount of
th" certificate; to recommend the es
tablishment of a standard of assess
ments; to fix a salary for the grand
di< Uit< r: to provide that a certain
}â¢! rtien of the Grand Lodge per cap
it.-, tax be set aside for organizntion
work; to have the official organ or
some similar periodical placed in the
hnndf- of every member, so that ea.h
may be apprised of the work and con
ditloti of the order. atÂ»<i that juvenile
1 i IkÂ»h of the order be established in
r-.-dei to educate those between the
ngfs r. 15 and 18 in the principles of
the ordf>r. All carried except the two
relating to salary and organization
work.
An. effort , was , ; made to make
the election of grand officers the spe-.
oial order for 10:30 o'clock. on Wed
nesday morning, but this was lost af
ter a long discussion, and the : hour
â¢rail fixed for 2 o'clock in the after
noon, r "â '.'â  J 'â '.â¢
BANQUET IN EVENING.
At the. afternoon session four mem
bers of the order were created* past
dictators for : services rendered to
their respective lodges, for many
years, and it was decided to request
the supreme lodge to confer the honor
ol' past grand dictator on R. A. A. Sum
mers of Liberty Lodge for his work
in behalf of the order during the past
fifteen years. .
The Grand Lodge contributed $20
to each of the two lodge members in
distress, and the grand dictator Â«rasj
authorized to send an appeal circular
to the subordinate lodges for further
assistance.
A communication from the supreme
dictator, J. C. Sheppard, offering to
do what he can for the membership
In this Stnte. was read, and it was
decided to invite him to visit this
Stnt<* in the near future to study the
conditions of the order.
The per capita tax was fixed at S2,
the same as at the previous session.
In the evening candidates were in
itiated before the grand body, and
later on all went to the banquet,
where, after the good things had
been partaken of, E. F. Joy acted as
toastmaster and the following pro
gramme was carried out: "Welcome,"

CITY TO BEAR
ITS JUST SHARE
Supervisors to Be Asked to
Provide for Schools Inde
pendently of State Aid
AVANTS MORE PUPILS
Board of Education Directs
Teachers to Encourage an
Average Daily Attendance
The Board of Education decided yes
terday to follow a new method in Its
request for the next fiscal year's ap
propriation from the Bc-ard of Super
visors. Heretofore it has^ been the
practice to include in the estimate a
request for an amount from the city
authorities which included the sum
contributed to the support of the San
Francisco schools by the State. In
this way the impression went forth that
the Supervisors appropriated the total
amount, whereas the sum contributed
by the city was but a small fraction of
the entire amount allowed. Last year
of the J1, 361, 000 set aside for school
purposes but $320,000 was appropriated
by the city, the remainder coming from
the State.
President Roncovieri, of the Board of
Education, has figured that under the
new apportionment law this city will
receive a sum estimated at $700,000. As
the city has nothing whatever to do
with this appropriation the Board of
Education will petition the Supervisors
for the balance only of the total sum
needed for the schools. The State
money can be used to pay teachers'
salaries solely, therefore the city must
provide about $300,000 additional for the
purpose, which will require about $1,
000,000. The estimate is now being pre
pared, and the Supervisors will be
asked to provide about $750,000 crut of
the city's funds to be joined to the
$700,000 allowed by the State.
A circular issued yesterday by Ron
covieri to principals calls attention to
the new law basing the State appor
tionment upon the average daily at
tendance, which will materially affect
the amounts to be received by this city
from the State. Principals are urgently
requested to enroll every pupil who
applies for admission, and if necessary
to resort to strenuous measures to pro
vide the necessary accommodaticms.
The ciicular says:
\V.- look to the teachers to exert their ut
most endeavors to Increase the average daily
attendance. A comparative review of the sta
tistlrs affecting attendance is not at all favor
able to Sar. Francisco. But 'M per cent of the
children of ochool age attend the public- schools,
whereas as high ap 65 per cent 1? attained in
some counties. Turn no prospective pupil away,
and whenever the overflow attendance Justifies
it the hoard will erect a portable school to pro
\ i<Jp the requisite accommodation?, or bxvi
temporary quarters until permanent ones ar
provided.
The circular informs principals that

ho. Several other industries were con

; The relation of the nerves and gen- ;

that nine- tenths of j the nervous pros- j

arise from some derangement of the

Fits of depression or restlessness and

that one minute she laughs, the next

nervous dyspepsia. . A tendency to cry

to nervous prostration.

Mrs. M B. Shot well, of 103 Flatbush '

"I cannot express the wonderful relief I ;
have experienced by taking Lydia E. Pink- [

a long time with nervous prostration, back-

not sleep and would walk the floor almost

"I had three doctors and got no better, and
life was a burden. I was advised to try
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable- Compound,
and it has worked wonders for me.
" I am a well woman, my nervousness is all

younger."
Will not the volumes of letters from
women made strong by Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound convince
all women of its virtues ? Surely you
cannot wish to remain sick and weak
and discouraged, exhausted each day,
when you can be as easily cured as
other women.

Coincident with the arrival of 3a
bez White, the English boxer, in New
York. Battling XeSson makes jjood a
threat he uttered some days since and
makes sensational charges against
Jimmy Britt. Manager Nolan, acting"
for Nelson, makes the specific charge
that Willie Britt, who represents his
brother, went to him in February and
said: "You know. Billy, this match
will have to be fixed up for us before
ue sign any articles. Jimmy can't
afford to take any chances. Nelson
will have to agree to quit or else
there will be no l'.sht as far as the
Jijrilts .-.re concerned.**-:
Xolan asserts that he was ap-
IJi-oaehed several times with the same
proposition and that when it was
lound neither he nor I.'elson would
entertain the proposition the match
with Jabez White wts made. Up to
the la.st moment Nei;Â«on had no idea
White was coming to this country- He
thought Manager Jim (troth was
using the name of the Engiieji boxer
to bring him to terms.
On the surface it seems that if Nel
son had not learned that Britt was to
receive a bonus of. 10 per cent of the
gross receipts he would have fulfilled
his part of the contract he entered Into
with the Yosemite Club. This was
signed some days before the Nelson-
Oorbett fight. In it the fighters' share
of the purse was fixed at 55 per cent of
the gross receipts.
lIKITTs EXTER A DKM \l..
Both Willie and Jimmy Britt enter
an emphatic denial of Nelson's charges
and place upon his shoulders the blame
for the calling off of the proposed
Britt-Nelson fight. They claim he
wanted the lion's share of the receipts.
Willie Britt further adds that Jimmy
will never enter into negotiations for a
match with Nelson while Nolan is as
sociated with him in any capacity.
Nolan and Nelson went to Larkspur
before the storm j broke yesterday.
When Jimmy Britt heard of the
charges made against him he was in a
fine rage and started on a still hunt
for Nolan. Had they met neither
referee nor timekeeper would have
been necessary, judging from the
warmth of Britt's feelings. Not lo
cating Nolan, Britt went to the Olym
pic Club and worked off the surplus
â team, spending two busy hours in
the gymnasium and the handball
court.
"Thi? is a lie made out of whole
â¢ :tt when discussing the
charge? My brother would not dare
approach me with a proposition such
â  >lan chums ira* made to him.
- glibly of cowardice and
of broken contracts. He is the coward
;<nd l jne who has broken the
â CL I;i our last fight his seconds
had. a hard time keying him in the
The next tim^ we meet I will
knock his bead off. A man can quit
without going through the ropes, but
1 will make him jump out of the ring."
NOI.W l< CMCTWITTED.
"We signed articles with the Yosem
ite Club and I have been willing to
abide by them and fight Nelson in
April. He seems to want to back out.
Nelson is angry at me because I would
not fight before a small club he ran in
Butte. I cannot see where Nelson has
any claims on me. The only man he
has beaten since I defeated him was
Ceroett. I could have picked up some
easy money fighting Corbett, but I
told him to show he could still make
a good showing. This gave Nelson a
chance to pick up some easy money.
At that his manager was outwitted, as
Corbelt received more money for los-
Ing than Nelson did for winning.
Nolan is a cheap sport, and I do not
want to engage in a mud-slinging
match with him. His word does not
go for much with the representative
sporting men."
WiJlie Britt, whom Nolan says ap
proached him. is emphatic In his de
nial of the charge. "After our visit to
Rutte I was unfriendly with Nolan be
cause he said Jimmy was afraid to
fight Herrera. We did not speak for a
long time. He finally made overtures
to me end we have been on speaking
terms for some time. I made several
trips with Manager Jim Coffroth of
the Yosemite Club to Larkspur and
finally signed articles for a fight be
tween Nelson and Britt. These were
the only negotiations I ever had with
Nolan. I think Nelson was injured in
Ms fight with Corbett and was afraid
to meet Jimmy this month. Jimmy
went into training in good faith for
the match.
"Jimmy can beat Nelson seven days
in the week. Nolan is a disgruntled,
tinhorn sport and is angry because he
( Mild not get what he wanted from the
dak."

WIIITK STARTS WEST AT ONCE.
Tom ORourke. Phil Duyer. Charley
D.vis and Others With Him.
NEW YORK. March 21. â It is a
singular fact that neither* Jabez White
nor his manager, Charley Mitchell,
were at all certain about any of
White's measurements until Tom
( ''K'>urkÂ« stood him up before a mir
ror in the Delavan Hotel bar to-night
and marked off his height and reach
and then took the other measurements
with a tape line. Both of the English
man expressed surprise that the news
papers on thi= side of the Atlantic
were so eager to accurately compare
the rival fighters. "There is one thing
1 <lo know," said Jabez White, "I
weighed 142 pounds when I left Eng
lar.,) and lost six pounds on the voy
age."
White has not the appearance of a
prizefighter. He is of mild counten
ance and modest and gentlemanly in
behavior. White and Mitchell will
leave for San Francisco to-morrow.
Tom O'Rourke, the well-known
pugilistic expert and fight promoter,
will accompany them. So will Phil
Dwyer, the turfman, and Charley
Davis, partner of John Daly, and other
well-known sports, all of whom will
put their money on the Englishman,
who has fought forty ring battles and
has not yet been defeated. White is
feeling better since his rough voyage.
Hf- is taking good care of himself and
will commence actual tr.-tining as soon
as he reaches the coast. He will prob
ably train at Alameda.
"ROUGH HOUSE"
EARNS TITLE
He Lands Three Haymakers
on 3leLaughlin and the
Referee Stops Slaughter,
Did "Rough House" McDonald have
a lead sinker or a water front restau
rant pinker in his glove? That's what
the sports who saw the Hawthorne
Athletic Club's fights at the pavilion
last night want to know.
In the fourth round with Jack Mc-
Laughlin, also called the English
rharaplon, "Rough House" swung a
haymaker onto the expansive mush of
the English champ. It sounded like
a pile driver on the home trip. A sec
ond and third haymaker made Mc
laughlin look like a severe case of
yellow Jaundice.
"Stop it." said Referee Ed Smith.
"This is no slaughter; this is human
warfare." Willing hands gently lifted
the English champion and bore him to
the boneyard-
The card was as good as ever set
the pavilionites screeching. Johnny
Crowe got the decision over Young
Dempsey in a fast and furious go.
Crowe put one on Dempsey's bugle in
the third that made him cautious and
thÂ« rest was Johnny's, though the
other youngster was game to the end.
Harry Tenny proved once more that
he is a little better than Johnny Mur
ray. In the fourth he turned a volley
of jolts on Murray that staggered him.
The latter"s second heard the under
taker's footsteps approaching and
threw up th> sponge, though Murray
wanted to stay for the funeral.
"Smiling Jim" Kane lost to Jack
Ennis after a plucky and keen fight.
Walter Stanton, who is also known as
"Maud," got the decision over Ed
Knock. John Rodney outboxed Jim
Gallagher and Ed Johnson put rt over
Kid Soto by a shade.

COLLEGE CREWS
WILL COMPETE
Coach Garnett Will Try
Two Radically Different
Systems at Berkeley
BERKELEY, March 21.â Coach E. M.
Garnett, in charge of rowing matters
at the University of California, an
nounced to-day the names of the men
chosen to row in the interclass rowing
races on Thursday- These races will
take place on the Oakland estuary.
The freshmen and sophomores will
row, and the juniors and seniors will
contest. The winner in each event will
compete in the final race.
The names of the men who will take
part are as follows:
Senior erew â E. A. Bannister, captain and
stroke; D. M. Evans, No. 3; G. J. Anloff,
No. 2; E. V. Dodge, No. 1; J. P. Loeb, cox

Junior erew â IV. A. Schmidt, captain and

Newcomb. coxswain.
Sophomore erew â I* Evajii, stroke; G. C.

Freshmen erew â , stroke; W. K.
TuJler, No. 3; H. J. Schaufele, captain and
No. 2; M. H. Wilbert. No. 1; E. J. Loeb,
coxswain.
Coach Garnett posted the following
bulletin this morning, addressed to the
boating men of the university and all
who are interested in college sport:
The interclass boat races to be rowed next
Thursday on the upper end of the estuary
should attract a large and enthusiastic crowd
to the scene of the contest. They should do
so for many valid reasons.
The genuine college spirit which is essential
to the healthful growth of the university is
still a weakly infant In the far West. It
requires all the nourishment that can be
properly administered. And it is Just such a
SUN ROSE, A 100 TO 1 OUTSIDER,
HOME AHEAD OF GLOOMY GUS
Clockers and Rail
birds Back the
Long Shot
Misty's Pride Beats
Andrew B. Cook
This Time.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The season for long shots is ap
proaching and Sun Rose, the first one
to be caught in full bloom, was plucked
yesterday at Oakland. The filly formed
one of a dozen starters in a five-fur
long dash for three-year-olds and in
the opening betting she was quoted
a 100 to 1 chance by several of the
books. When the clockers and rail
birds had finished their circuit of the
ring, 25 to 1 prevailed. Little Graham
got the hot thing away first and the
iiliy lasted long enough to beat the
favorite. Gloomy Gus, nearly a length.
Velna ran an indifferent third.
Five out of six choices came home
in front, and the books received a thor
ough drenching. The track was heavy
and slow.
YOLO GIRL NEARLY LANDS.
Yolo Girl, a 100 to 1 shot, made mat
ters interesting for Iron Watson, fa
vorite for the two-year-old scramble.
She led for most of the distance. Jones,
astride the first choice, had to do some
lively kicking and hustling to beat the
outsider a head. Avonella ran third.
Two dangerous 'ones, E. M. Brattain
and Adirondack, were scratched from
the six-furlong number, with the
weights raised ten pounds above the
scale. This left Tarn O'Shanter, the
mount of Ike Tullett, the pick of the
talent. Ike rode a well judged race,
landing the favorite a clever winner
over the 20 to 1 shot, Toto Gratiot. Ed
inborough led for more than five fur
longs, when he began to slow down,
finishing third.
If handicaps are to become a farce
the best thing the association across
the bay can do is to eliminate them
from the programme for the balance
of the season. It cannot be possible
that Frank Otis imagined he put forth
his best efforts on Andrew B. Cook in
the fourth event, decided over the Fu
turity course.
RACE IS A TRAVESTY.
The race was a travesty. The price
about Misty's Pride fell from 2% to 1
down to 17 to 10. Jakie Jones was
permitted to cut but his own style of
pace with the mare and she won all
the way. Otis, astride Andrew B.
Cook, appeared in no hurry to run her
down, and flnishedsecond. dgarlighter
ran a good third. Salable ran out in
the stretch. Letola, which opened fa
vorite, stumbled as the barrier was
raised, throwing Knapp and complet
ing the distance riderless.
Both Montana Peeress and Dora I
were scratched from the mile selling
affair. If War Times had been Bel
dame no more money could have been
bet on her. She finished first. Profit
able ran second, well rated; Lady
Fashion third and Lady Kent secured
fourth money.
Billy Cahill's Andrew Mack proved
too much for Soufriere in the final
mile and fifty-yard selling event. The
Cahill entry was playad down to 4 to 5
favoritism, and, passing the mare on
the far turn, beat her handily at the
wire. Ethel Abbott led Hugh Mc-
Gowan out for the show.
TRACK NOTES.
It is to be hoped the season for lead
ing them in will not be inaugurated
too early this year.
Floyd Fountain and Jakin Jones
divided the saddle honors, each pilot
ing two winners.
W. L. Stanfield was wrathy over the
ride given Andrew B. Cook, and not
without reason. It was the most
stupid exhibition Frank Otis has fur
nished at the meeting.
Supervision fell with McÃride in the
opening race opposite the paddock en
trance, the prostrate rider just miss
ing being struck by Novi. His arm
was slightly bruised by coming in con
tact with the fence, and Wiley was
substituted on Cigarlighter.
It only goes to show what class will
do. On St. Patrick's day Profitable
won a mile race easily in 1:45%. Still
War Times defeated him without a
struggle yesterday in 1:44, over a fair
track.
Wiley drove Lady Fashion in the
fifth race as if afraid the mare would
get out of the 2:27 class.
Sun Rose recently outworked Emma
Reubold, so it was reported. That
made her look a cherry ripe 100 to 1
shot
The association across the bay will
hang up $1500 for a three-mile race
to be run on April 8. Veterano, Hora
tius, Grafter, Flying Torpedo and
Orchan will be among the starters.
Soufriere went back the betting
fast when that final rush was made on
Andrew Mack. Thirteen to five could
be had.
Solomon Bonner still remains in
dark seclusion.
Lick to Play Van der Naillens.
The Lick School baseball team will
play a practice game with the scien
tific ball tossers from the Van der
Naillen Engineering College this after
noon at Golden Gate Park. This will
be one of the last games the High
School boys will indulge in before the
league schedule commences. Captain
White believes he has a strong nine-
The team which is practically select
ed to Play In the league this season
consists of White (captain), pitcher;
Hall, catcher; Hotchiss, shortstop:
Heitmuller, first base; Acton, second
base; Dearin, third base; Barieu, left
field; Miller, center field; Glackin, right
field; Boyd, substitute catcher. The
game will be called at 3 o'clock.
stimulus as these class races should afford to
the 'generous rivalry" among the classes that
leads to the formation of enduring friendships
and to the best of college sentiments and tra
ditions that are among the university's most
cryfns needs.
Furthermore, the races this year will pro
vide the first opportunity in the history of
boating in California for a study of the best
styles of scientific collegiate rowing. I have
taught two radically different systems to the
four crews that will compete in the races.
This is to add a little more" zest in the sport
and also to furnish an approximate test of
excellence.
The juniors and sophomores will row a slight
modification of the English stroke as prac
ticed at Oxford. The seniors and freshmen
will disport themselves in a semi-professional
style of watermanship similar to the stroke
that enabled Harvard to beat Yale more than
an eighth of a mile in '85 at New London
and to the style that won Syracuse the race
at Poughkeepsle last year.
Though none of the crews has attained per
fection, each has become as skillful as could
be expected In the light of Its opportunities.
If they do their utmost to retain to the
bitter end their form aÂ»d style as taught the
races should be close and interesting.

WAVES SWEEP
MEN TO DEATH
Carry Fourth Officer and
Carpenter Overboard From
the Steamship Sarmatian
HALIFAX, N. 8., March 21.â With
the news that her fourth officer and
her carpenter were swept overboard
during a tempest during its passage,
the Allan line steamship Sarmatian
arrived here to-day, eighteen days out
from Glasgow. The Sarmatian is
bound for Boston.
NEW YORK, March 21.â The Ham
burg-American line steamship Patricia,
from Hamburg, came in to-day four
days late, after an extremely stormy
voyage. Her 2800 passengers were con
fined to their quarters during almost
the entire voyage; but beyond the dis
comforts incident to the weather, they
were well upon arrival.
Captain Magin says the waves were>
so high that from ' the bridge, which
is fifty-five feet from the water line,
he was unable to see over the top of
the high-rolling seas.
Ladies at Tennis Play.
The ladies' handicap doubles tourna
ment scheduled for last Saturday was
played down to the semi-finals yester
day on the park courts. The handicap
ping was good and the matches were
all close and exciting. Joseph Daily,
the crack professional, has been coach
ing the young ladies and there is a
marked improvement in their play.
Only three matches were played, the
last of which was not completed. The
best match was that between Miss
Lulu Wegener and Mrs. C. Watson
Lowe (15 1-6) and Miss S. Van Vliet
and Miss D. Weed (scratch). All four
players were at their best and the
match was thoroughly enjoyed by the
spectators. The handicap team won
the first set, but lost the next two.
The other preliminary round match
was also a closely contested one. Miss
V. Beyfuss and Miss E. Hess (4-6) won
the first set from Miss V. Crocker and
Miss I. Mearns (owe 1-6), but the lat
ter outplayed them in the second and
third sets. The score in favor of Miss
Crocker and Miss Mearns waa 1-6, 6-4,
6-3.
One of the semi-final matches was
started, but darkness put a stop to
play when two sets had been com
pleted. The contestants were Miss
Wegener and Mrs. Watson (owe 15 1-6)
and Miss G. Myer and Miss A. Vodden
(owe 1-6). The former won the first
set, 6-3, and the latter took the second
by a score of 6-2.

CLOSE GUARD
ON WITNESSES
Federal Officers Attempt to
Maintain Strict Secrecy
in Beet' Trust Inquiry
CHICAGO, March 21.â Fifteen secret
service men have been brought to Chi
cago to guard the witnesses who will
appear to testify before the special
Grand Jury, which to-morrow will
begin the investigation of the transac
tions of the so-called beef trust. So
great is the desire of the Federal offi
cers to maintain a strict secrecy in
the investigation that every witness
who testifies before the inquisitorial
body will be closely guarded by one of
the secret service men. to prevent his
being approached by newspaper men
or agents of the packers.
C. B. Morrison, who to-day was ap
pointed District Attorney to succeed
S. H. Bethea, recently appointed Dis
trict Judge, declared to-night that any
person detected speaking to or inquir
ing the name of any of the witnesses
would be liable for contempt of court.
Twenty men have qualified as grand
jurors, and the Federal officials hope
to be able to complete the list of jurors
to-morrow.

Barkentine Fullerton Has a Very Close Cal
The barkentlne Fullerton narrowly
escaped disaster Monday night in the
breaking waves of the Potato Patch.
She was coming in from sea by ay
cf the North Channel, in tow of the
steamer Argyll, which had brought her
from Kahului The two-line parted
close to the steamer's stern. Without
sail and with 140 feet of 16-inch rope
hanging over her bow, the Fullerton
was unable to help herself and drifted
on the Potato Patch, which was
breaking fiercely. Sea after sea board
ed the barkentine and for a time it
seemed as if the bombardment would
be too much for her. An effort was
made to haul in the tow-lire, but it
proved a work beyond the strength of
the Fullerton's crew. Meanwhile the
heavy rope had settled to the bottom,
Bscurely anchoring the oil carrier in
the very thick of the breaking seas.
Prompt action was necessary to save
the vessel. Sail was made, and as soon
as the canvas was set, the towline
was cut adrift and with her own
wings the Fuilerton worked out her
salvation.
The Arryll picked her up later and
â sela came safely into port.

LEAPS INTO SEA
FROM A LINER
Andrew Griscom, a Wealthy
College Student, Jumps to
Death in the Atlantic
WOMAN IN THE CASE
Boy Was Believed to Ha*e
Followed Governess Across
Ocean From Philadelphia
NEW YORK. March 21.â Andrew M.
Griscom of Philadelphia, who disap
peared from Philadelphia several weeks
ago, and was supposed to be In Europe,
committed suicide on March 19 by
jumping overboard from the steamship
Minnetonka.
Griscom sailed on the Minnetonka
from London for this city. When he
jumped overboard the steamship was
stopped, and a boat was lowered, but
he could not be found. It is supposed
that he was temporarily unbalanced
mentally. Griscom was a member of
a well-known Philadelphia family.
When Grlscora disappeared from
Philadelphia it was reported that he
had eloped with a young woman and
that both of them had gone to Europe.
Griscom's mother, however, denied it.
News of the suicide was made public
when the Minnetonka reached this port
to-day.
PHILADELPHIA, March 21.âAn
drew M. Griscom was the son of W W.
Griscom, a millionaire resident of Bryn
Mawr, a suburb. Young Griscom, who
was a student at the University of
Pennsylvania, left his boarding-house
during the first week in February and
was not heard from until February 9,
when he visited the (^New York office
of the Reading Hardware Company, of
which his father is one of the owners.
The boy made a request for money and
his father, upon being communicated
with, ordered that his son be supplied
with funds. Nothing further was
heard of the boy until February 20,
when it was learned that he had sailed
for Europe.
Later, it was learned that Elsie Han
som, who had been a governess In the
Griscom family, had preceded young
Griscom, and there were rumors of a
contemplated elopement, but this was
subsequently denied. When Griscom's
father learned that his son was in
Europe, he sent a friend to bring the
boy home and it is supposed that he
was accompanying this man on the
Minnetonka.

t'hurrh streets. Monday night, voicerl
their (Mqpteasnrc over the recent action
of the Board of Education in Its reclas
siflcation of the James Lick and
Valley schools. The action of i!i->
board in making classifications con
trary to the wishes of parents ant
pupils was condemned freely by UsOT â¢
in attendance.
At a former meeting of the im
provement club Superintendent Lang
don coincided with the parents in their
protests against the injustice of th->
classification of the schools, as it
seemingly worked a hardship on the
smaller children, who are compelle.l
to walk several blocks to attend on
of the two schools, while under the
.â¢oiiciitions formerly existing the lit
tle ones could attend the school near
est their homes.
At the former meeting a committee
war appointed to wait on the B
of Education and represent to it the
injustice of enforcing the rule. It
was then thought that with the back
ing of the Superintendent and the ur
gent r-quest of the majority of Us*
its. the board would yield anil
restore the former conditions until
such time as other school buii
coold be provided, but to all this a
deaf ear was turned.
This subject, together with that of
a distribution of street lights. was
the topic most discussed at thÂ» meet
ing. It VJtM said by the committee
appointed for the purpose of In
gating the distribution of lights that
In â  great majority of the inha;
streets there are no lights. whi>
others there are apparently morÂ»
are necessary. No great fault
(ovnid with the liberal use of lights if
streets not favored could get cv
few.
ORVTACI.KS \\\Y. IN" WAY
OF ( AI.IFOKMA OIL TR.%DE
- Secretary Evans of the Pacific Com
mercial Museum finds that there are
difficulties in the way of moving Cal
ifornia petroleum to the Philippines
for the use of the Philippine Govern
ment. Recently Mr. Evana urged
upon the Government at Washington
that California have a chance to bid
for supplying ' petroleum. Favorable
action was taken in response. It now
appears that there is no way to move
any considerable quantity of petrole
um from California.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany reports that its passenger vessels
are going full and cannot take on a
large amount of oil from California.
The company has no freight boats.
The transports cannot carry oil large
ly, their .space being required for
army suplles. â¢ Mr. Evans hopes that
some other way will be found to give
California a chance at the oil trade in
the Philippines that is now in other
hands. Oil barges such as are oper
ated along the coast might solve the
problem. . |'.

SANTA MARIA. March 21. â Crop
conditions are excellent In this sec

many acres of onions. With re

tirely destroying the onion beds. This
is about the only loss to crops by the
storm. It is more than balanced by
the universal good caused by the rain.

The New York wires of K. F. liutton &
Cc. yesterday said :
STOCKSâ The market is closing lower and
â¢â¢"*:. At the opining special stocks showed
quite a little strength, but all through thÂ«?
*t-t.*.on tbe market seemed under pressure,
with the old-time favorite* particularly Union
Pacific, weak. The cloetne to-night shows a
6>eidedly weak tone and dearly suggests that
tlie buying power for the moment at least ha*
beer, exhausted.
COTTONâ The cotton market reacted to-day,
principally on the forts of the' largest buy- ;
crt and manipulators of yesterday's advance i
â¢roeaioring to realize or reduce their holdings.
Spot markets are dull and generally un
changed. WÂ« see little in the general situa
tion to bull the market on at present and we
*v not expect anything better than a com
jwatively narrow traUers' market for small, ;
quick turcÂ« until the acreage question has been
definitely sett yd.
COFFEEâ European cables were again dls
arvointir^: this morning, with some selling
from that quarter, and our market opened
6 '"to 10 lower. Trade has been very limited. ;
It looks as though the Wall street contingent
ire retting out of pome of their May and re
p:acing with later positions. Bull enthusiasm
is laekir.ic in outside epecutators.
COPPKR â Boston, March 21. â Th* copper
market ot-ened strong, with little . activity. .
Tc^ward the close New York stocks weakened
badly and the close here was also weak In
â ympathjr. The floating supply of Allouez-at
preser.t seems to be very small, about the
oc!y stock offered being by traders who bought
et lower srlces.
Tho Weatlier and Crop*.
Th* Â«<< ' A G. McA.i.. Â»ection
director of the climate and crop FervidÂ© of the
Weather Bureau, la &a follows:
:;.Al. SVMMART
The weather during the week was generally
wirm and cioudy. with strong southerly winds
and frequr-nt heavy rain* In all parts of the
State. T)ie soil In some sections is so thor
oughly saturated that much of tbe recent rain
ha? run to waste. Considerable damage was
done clonK the coast. eepeciaJly at seaside re
sort* in Southern California, by the high winds
and strong surf, and railroad traffic was com
pletely blockaded in the south by washouts
an<i landslides.
Crops weie generally benefited by thÂ« rain,
although some slight damage was done to
standing t re. in and cut alfalfa in some sec
tiecs Grain .continues In rood condition and
ft making Â«ucceJlenl growth with prospects of
heavy crope in all parts of the State. Farm
â work has been suspended owing to the con
tinuous rame and wet toil." Green /eed is un
usually abundant. and growing rapidly.
"i^orrespondentF in several sections report that
the high winds during the last two weeks have
caused vfry little damage to deciduous fruits.
In th* SaoramentÂ© Valley it ik reported that
apricots, almonds end peaches are co far ad
vanced as to be comparatively [ safe, from in
jury by frost, but grapes are now at a stage
â¢.'â¢ be seriously damaged should severe frosts
occur. | All * deciduous . fruits j are . in splendid
condition and give Indications â cord-break
ing crops. Citrus fruits are in bloom and thÂ«
orchards are in first-class condition.
SACKAMEN'TO V ALLEY. â Tht continuous
light rains during the week caused a. xtispÂ«n-
Eion of all farm work., but no serious damage
r<;eulted from either rain or high southerly
winds. Heavy rain fell In portions of the
northern section' on the lÂ»th N Slightly cooler
weather prevailed at the close of the week.
Grain continue* in good condition and the out
look for large crops was never "bettor. Alfalfa
if making rapid growth and heavy, crops are
txpected. Green - feed is unusually plentiful
and stock are In good condition. Almonds.
apricots and peaches are well set and are prob
eb,ly past danger Irani frost, but grapes are co
far advanced that severe frosts would causa
great damage. Prospects are. good for heavy
yiei<3s cf almonds and all deciduous â¢ fruits.
Citrus fruits are in blossom. . â  -
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â Warm
weather with frequent heavy rains and strong
â¢outhf-rly winds, prevailed nearly an the week
The soil i* thoroughly saturated and farm
wcrk hue been suspended. No material dam
age was donÂ« to crops by the rain or bigh
winds, but roads Â»Ed bridges were washed out.
Grain made good growth and .looks .well;, the
prospect for a heavy crop was never better.
Barley la reported remarkably heavy in Ven
tura County. Alfalfa continues In good con
dition and will yield a large crop. Green feed ,
Is plentiful Deciduous fruits arÂ« full of bloom
and advancing rapidly, with prospects of
heavy crops.
â¢ fcAN JOAQTO* VALLEY.â CIoudy weather.
with heavy rains, prevailed during th* week -in
the valley aM heavy Â«now fell in the moun
tains V rains have been th* heaviest of the
â¢ea*on. Irripstion ditches are running full and
farm and orchard work Is surpended owing .to
the. wet ground. In com* localities In the
extreme northern portion of thÂ» valley sum
trier-fallowed grain and alfalfa are lodged, but
In general rre'r. and grass are making rapid
growth and are In excellent condition. Fruit
trees and vines are thrifty but It Is thought
that the high wind of the 12th caused damage
to the deciduous fruits in some sections. Stock
are in pxtjcllent condition and healthy.
* SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-â weather
continued warm and cloudy during the . week,
with frequent hesvy rains In all sections. Some
â¢light damage was done to growing grain and
cut alfalfa, but in other respects the rain was
Beneficial to farmers and orchard'.sts Rail

New .York Stock Market.
NKW YORK. March. â The narrowing
limit* -of the speculation . was a fact clearly
defined by the Cay's events in the stock market
asid it is generally, believed that the money.
oitlock is the factor making for trlctilon.
Hot only was tbe volume of dealings largely
curtailed, but the . movement of prices was
elufrgish and uncertain. The hope that yester
day's late rally marked a resumption of- the
uj)v.crd movement did not . last â¢ longer - than
the flrst hour to-Hay.'. Profit taking was freely
in evidence and there was no substantial de
mind u> follow the ellgbt opMilng advance in
price*: There was a resumption â¢of strength
et Â«om> jjoints during tbe rest of the day, but
til rras in 'the lra>s Important grade of stocks
'that Tei!Â«l to impress sentiment in the same
Aetrrto as eln-.ltar movements of stock of the
Â«firÂ»t class. Neither Wle the " evidence cf
rtrenMh wo!J maintained, the ' whole . market
rhotvinff the Â«lTect cf tbÂ«; dlmlÃishlnp demand.
Industrials ni<ti >peclalties rr.ad* tjp the largest
rart or *hf Aay's .shoeing cf streacth. ' The
r:: iron morser report was revived in
full rit"r '.'.rd it!t railroad equipment stocks
tvÂ»iÂ» stllJ tvfponeive to the brilliant business
rrf.s;*ct!' in that dcpfirtment of Industry. The
tsnveryinc growth and c.iramlon rcrÂ»orted from
â¢n lines of trafic and indaetry had a natural
i influence upon the securities representing dif-
f erent industries covered by these reports. In
addition there were many rumors that dividend
resumptions and .increases were â¢ in â  definite
proepect. which eventuated in the Ten
nessee Coal dividend. ThÂ« Corn Prod
ucts -stocks were in contrast to the- rule
and differed from expressed doubts of th*
maintenance of the dividend,", Justified as ; the ;
market closed by the announcement of r a re
duction, i Sugar reflected the shutting < down,
of its principal refinery. In the Chicago Union
Traction stocks the obvious trouble was the >
action agsiiwt Its franchises by the Chicago
city government. In the railroad department,
while the Interest was small and the move
ments mostly abortive, the reports upon which
they were based pointed to projects of grand
iose proportions. Thus It was paid that Penn
sylvania was taking over Atchison with the
purpose of guaranteeing a 5 per cent dividend
on that stock. There were vague Intimations
of an immediate dividend to be forthcoming
on Southern Pacific. The Chesapeake and
Ohio movement also was connected with divi
dend rumor*. These rumors proved to be not
very Impressive la the face of the modest di
mension* of the resulting movements in stocks
affected. The easier tone of the call money
market was attributed to the passing of the
effects of the Government's withdrawals of
deposits from the banks last week. It was
said also that some large holders of securities
were transferring their stocks on a large scale
to London with a view to taking advantage of
the lower money rates over there, to hold their
securities in that market. The effect would
be to relieve the local money market of that
much demand and It is thought to confusa
somewhat the estimates of. .the demand for
our securities for foreign account. Tim*
money was appreciably firmer and Interest
rates tn that department were lifted a frac
, tion. Sterling exchange, in response, continued
. weak. The belief was strengthened that
money rates will shortly harden and specula
, tive ardor was cooled accordingly. Something
was made of professed fears of foreign compli
| cations growing out of .Venezuelan affairs, but
the growing weakness of the market was gen
erally attributed to disappointment ' over the
scanty demand for stocks. The cloving was
weak and at the lowest of the day. â  â

are rapidly maturing. The steamer Alameda

HOPE TO REACH
UNDERSTANDING
Powder Trust Suit Against
Chemical Company, May Be
Settled Out of Court
PEACE NOW IN SIGHT
Compromise Suggested That
Will Give DuPonts Two
Directors on the. Board
Counsel for both sides in the case of
E. I. DuPoni de N>mours Powder
Company ye. Peyton Chemical Com
pany are s;:;d practically to have
reached an urderstanding with relation
to some of thf r.volved in the
litigation.
According to statements made by the
representatives of the DuPonts the
counsel for the Peyton Chemical
Company have agreed that the trans
fer books of that company would be
opened so that the DuPontf- could
qualify their candidates for directors,
and with that understanding Judge
States Circuit Judge Morrow has con
tinued the case for one week. It was
elated around the courtroom that if
the Peyton Chemical Company would
agree to give the DuPonts two out of
five â  directors there would be no fur
ther effort made to have" an election
held by the court. In the meanwhile

holder must have 100 shares in his own
name in order to be eligible as a direc

of the Peyton Chemical Company, they
being stockholders for less than 100
shares on the books of the company.

FARNUM IS SOMETHING OF
COLLEGE COWBOY.
Acting Breathes More
of Campus Than
of Camp.
Pleases His Hearers,
Nevertheless, as
Virginian.
If there is any one that has not read
"The Virginian," he may as well * :ke
in the play before the book. It is well
worth taking in to those that have and
to those that have not, but those that
have not will perhaps get more joy of
Mr. "W'ister's book-drama at the Co
lumbia this week.
One has a r*aJly fatal faculty of
making one's own pictures of book
people. 1 never found a Princess
Goldenlocks picture with hair long
enough and gr>ld enough to suit me
when she was my favorite heroine. I
never lound a Juliet on the stage half
so lovely a? I had dreamed her. Mr.
Wteter says they opened "The Virgin
ian" and Dustin Farnum stepped out
from its leaves his ideal incarnated â
but not for my ken. Still, Mr. Wister
should know. If any one should, Mr.
Wister should krfow his Wyoming, and
n' be Htya Dustin Farnum, who plays
the Virginian's" part, is his ideal of
.'.boy hero, it must be so.
1 fancy most of us out in this wilder
West have made unto ourselves an
other 'Virginian, suppler, leaner,
s-terner, less the captivating boy Mr.
Fainum makes him, more the tenser
fibred mv that for the sake of the
rough justice of the country dooms his
friend to be hung.
Something of the bigness, loneliness,
nobility of the character is wanting,
something lacking:, too. of the fascinat
ing aplomb of th<i Virginian, but in all
it? lighter graces, and as a lover, Mr.
Farnum excels. Not that- it is a con
ception in the least degree namby
pamby; it has a virility all its own:
but it is a virility perhaps rather of
the campus than of the camp, in spite
of leather leggins, sombrero and ban*
danna to the contrary. But such a
handsomeness! as the girl next me
said, and 1 agreed. And such a smile!
And such a voice! Mr. Farnum is
probably twice better to look at than
the original Virginian, and if you have
coincided with Mi. Wister in ideal you
will like him immensely.
The rest of the cowboys are a good
cowboy gang, some of the smaller parts
beng capitally acted. The best, of
Â« curse, is Trampas, done in supple,
e!ectric fashion by Frank Campeau. It
is onf of the Â«ieverest character por
trait? of this season, full of nulse and
power. Guy Bates Post, again as
Steve, could not be bettered. It is a
portrait that gets to the bone under
the leggins. and near to the tears
"here the cattle-stealer goes to his
death. Nebrasky. Spanish Ed and
Honey Wiggin are all cleverly played,
and Uncle Hughie, Judge Henry and
Dow one is glad to meet.
The woman in the case. Miss Ifoltte
Wood. well. Helen Holmes is not the
Mollie of the book. One moment onl>
of genuine sympathy Miss Holme*
showed, but that such a true and pow
erful one that one waits hopefully for
more from her. It is when Mollie
pleads with the Virginian for Tram
pa's life, and Miss Holmes here de
veloped a considerable and genuine
emotional thrill. For the rest she was
somewhat thin and amateurish.
The play itself is a clear, compact
and genuinely dramatic presentation of
trip story, retaining the action of the
chief incidents and by deft narration
very effectively working in much of
those impossible to dramatize. A very
good audience manifested large plea
sure in the production, and its suc
cess is certainly assured.

SUPERVISORS MAY GRANT
A SECOND FRANCHISE!
( ity Attorney Holds Charter Does Not
Deny Santa Fe Company An
other Privilege.
City Attorney Long yesterday ad
vised the Board of Supervisors that
subdivision 28 of section 1 of chap
ter 2 of article 2 of the charter does
not deny the power to grant an addi
tional franchise to the Atchison, To- i
peka and Santa Fe Railroad Com
pany.
The Santa Fe Company was granted
a franchise two years ago to enter the |
city and operate a steam road on cer
tain streets along the Potrero. A sec
ond petition was filed for a franchise j
to construct a series of spur tracks to
connect with its main line and the in- I
dustrial center in the Potrero. Pro- I
testing property owners raised the j
point that the first franchise was a I
bar to the grant of a second. Long,
in his opinion, says:
While the section of the charter quoted Is
undoubtedly to be construed as a grant to
and not a limitation of power of the board,
it benrs evidence of a legislative Intent to
prescribe a rule- to govern the entry of such,
railroads into the city and county of San
Frainisco. and docs not purport to affect the
control of s-ueh railroads after they have so
enured. Th* proposed ordinance will have to
do with the enjoyment of certain rights of the'
lailroad company named therein after It has
entered and established its road. It is my
orinion that the section of the charter re
dition.

MAYOR TO NAME
COMMISSIONER
His Honor Will Soon Appoint
His Brother Herbert as a
Member of Police Board
WITTMAN IS DOOMED
Opinion General That Chief
and Sergeant Ellis Will Be
Eemoved From Positions
In all likelihood Mayor Schmitz will
on Saturday night announce the ap
pointment of his brother, Herbert
Schmitz, to be Police Commissioner.
His Honor stated yesterday that the
complexion of things might change in
the meantime, but those who profess
to be on the "inside" assert that there
will be no change and that the ap
pointment of Herbert Schmitz is a
foregone conclusion.
It is said that the Mayor is waiting
until the Wittman case has been dis
posed of before naming his brother.
It is the general opinion that Wittman
is doomed to be dismissed from his
position as Chief when the Police
Commission meets next Friday night.
Neither the Mayor nor the Police
Commissioners have given any inkling
as to the identity of Wittman's prob
able successor. Gossir> has mentioned
the names of Police Captains Duke,
Gleason and Martin and Detective
Jerry Dinan, but it is being rumored
that the new Chief of Police will be
some one not at present in the depart
ment. Commissioner of Public "Works
Maestretti denies that he has his eyes
on the job and says he has enough
trouble in b,ls present position without
looking for more as Chief of Police.
In fact just who the man will be has
not been settled.
It is the general opinion that Ser
geant Ellis will also be dismissed by
the Police Commissioners because of
his connection with the Chinatown
scandal. The Chinatown squad impli
cated in the matter will probably not
fare so badly, as the Police Commis
sion will content Itself with imposing
a heavy fine on the patrolmen for the
part they took in the affair.
VETERAN LAID TO REST
BY HIS ARMY COMRADES
Impressive and Beautiful Services at
Funeral of the Late Colonel
George H. Wallis.
A large number of Grand Army
comrades, companions of the Loyal
Legion and other leading citizens at
tended the funeral of the late Colonel
George H. Wallis yesterday afternoon
at the hall of George H. Thomas Post,
G. A. R., on Golden Gate avenue. The
beautiful and impressive Grand Army
service was conducted by Charles W.
Gordon, commander, and John H.
Roberts, adjutant of the post. Appro
priate words were spoken by Rev. Dr.
Clampett of Trinity Church. The pall
bearers were Colonel Jesse B. Fuller,
Colonel William R. Smedberg, Hor
ace Wilson, George L. Harris, George
H. Buckingham. W. A. Grubb. R. J.
Taussig and O. yon Geldern. The in
terment was in the post plat, national
cemetery. Presidio.
The career of Colonel Wallis in
military and civil life was useful and
honorable. He responded in 1861 to
the first call oÂ£ President Lincoln for
men to preserve the Union, enlisting
in April as a private in the Forty
second New York Infantry. Subse
quently he was promoted to first lieu
tenant! Third United States Infantry,
and served with that regiment until
1867.
As a citizen of San Francisco he
was an active man of affairs. For
many years he was associated with
the late A. S. Hallidie in the wire
works. He was also actively identified
with the Mechanics' Institute as a
trustee and gave that institution the
benefit of his excellent judgment. In
the walks of life where he was best
known he was regarded as a high
minded, man of sterlins character.
Mrs. Snediker Loses Mine.
The Supreme Court decided yester
day that Emma S. Snediker could not
recover an interest in the Eagle Bird
mine. David Ayres and his partners
performed a considerable amount of
work on the property and as payment
for their services could not be secured
otherwise a court judgment for the
sum total of the bills was granted on
application. The mine was sold to
settle the account and the creditors
bid it in. The plaintiff alleged that
the whole legal proceeding was fraud
ulent, but the Supreme Court finds
that the defendants acted in accord
ance with the law.

Ellis Nelson, Charged With
Complicity in Murdering
3Fan and Wife. Captured
FOUND OX PEXSACOLA
Sheriff of Lone Star State
Takes Prisoner Back to
Undergo Trial for Crime
Ellis Nelson, a member of the hospi
tal corps of the navy and attached to
the training ship Peilsacola, was ar
rested yesterday morning by Sheriff J.
F. Stanley of Trinity County, Tex., and
Detectives Conlon and McGowan of this
city on a charge of murder. He was
brought to the City Prison and yester
day afternoon Sheriff Stanley left with
him for Texas. The crime is alleged
'to have been committed in Weld'on
County, Texas.
Sheriff Stanley says that a feud had
existed between a family named Alex
ander on one side and the Nelson and
the Crowson families on the other. The
families lived near Groveton, Weldon
County. On a Monday morning in
August, 1901, four Nelson brothers, in
cluding Ellis, and two of the Crowsons
armed themselves and rode to the farm
of Bob Alexander. They called Alex
ander out and when he appeared he
was shot dead, four bullets being found
later in his body. His wife, hearing the
shots, ran outside and as she bent over
the body of her husband a volley was
fired at her and she fell dead over the
lifeless body of her husband. Three
bullets had taken effect.
The daughter of the Alexanders came
outside and three shots were fired at
her. She ran round the corner of the
huuse and succeeded in making her
escape. Three of the Nelsons were ar
rested and the two Crowsons, but Ellis
disappeared. It was only about six
weeks ago that the discovery was made
that he had enlisted in the hospital
corps at Houston, Tex., in his own
name and he was traced to the Pensa
cola.
Esau Nelson was tried and convicted,
but was granted a new trial and "as his
mind seemed to have been affected the
District Attorney withdrew the charge
against him. Another brother was
tried, convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment. The others are still
awaiting trial. They have demanded a
change of venue from Weldon County
â¦o Trinity County. The father of the
Nelson bc-ys is a physician.
DOCTORS AND CHEMIST
ARE AT LOGGERHEADS
Bothc Sajs He Found Strychnine.
While Millar and Stephen Say
That It Was Opium.
Between City Chemist Bothe and
Drs. Millar and Stephen of the Central
Emergency Hospital exists a wide di
vergence of opinion as to the kind of
poison that ended the life 'of an un
identified man found unconscious on
the street on March 8, and who died
in the Central Emergency Hospital a
few hours later. At the inquest yes
terday Dr. Bothe testified that he had
found crystals of strychnine in th<Â»
stomach of the dead man. Drs. Mil
lar and Stephen, who treated the de
ceased at the hospital, swore that the
man had none of the symptoms of
strychnine poisoning, but that on the
contrary he had all the symptoms of
an overdose of opium. They said fur
ther that there was the most marked ;
difference between the symptoms '
caused by the two drugs.
On cross-examination Dr. Bothe ad- I
mitted that he had not applied any
chemical tests to the crystals found in
the stomach. He had examined them
through a microscope and found
them morphologically to be strych
nine.
The jury returned a verdict that
death had "been caused by strych
nine" and added, "but we doubt as to
whether it w;is caused by strychnine
or opium poisoning."

GEORGE JAMES
TALKS OF BIRDS
TO CLUB WOMEN
The California Club had a red-letter
day yesterday, when George Wharton j
James, the widely-known lecturer and |
writer of things Western, talked to the i
ladies about "Birds."
Now there's nothing ordinary about
Ptf r. Jamesâ therefore â  was there noth- j
ing ordinary about his talk.
Wisely refraining from going over l
the ground vof bird legislationâ which j
had been gleaned beforeâ he discussed
birds from the physical, economic, so- [
cial, artistic and spiritual viewpoints,
and in the easy fascinating manner of
a confirmed optimist.
" \nd of this charge Mr. James was ;
found to be guilty, for he pleaded hard f
for the joy of lifeâ the ecstacy to be ;
found :in the things that are ours by j
gift of nature, the birds and the flow
ers, quoting from . Ina Coolbrith,
Joaquin Miller and other famous op
timists and deliberate promoters of
joy. pwÃPÃ"W*'
Of Miller he had this to sayâ right i
out in meetinâ "A friend : calling upon I
the poet, looked about for the books I
the poet read. Not observing many, i
he remarked: 'Mr. Miller, I don't see |
many books about. ', Don't you read?" "
'-'Books, 1 '; quoth the poet, "to hâ l with '
books. " When : - I , want books I write .
them.'IJiSSBS
It should be remarked, ,in justice to
Mr. James, that he very properly ele
vated 1 his ; fingers to quote the above
remark. 'â â¢â -, ,
A :â 'â  magnetic , v speaker - Mr. James
proved :to be,' blending the esthetic
sanely with the practical, and it has
be.en i many a day since ] the club en
joyed so delightful an hour. 'li
The day was in charge of the depart
ment of : education, - Madame Tojetti
chairman, to whom, and to Miss Alice
Parks, , were the honors due * for having i
engaged so â  busy . a man to talk.
As a recompense he had an interest
ed "â  audience ; and |an enthusiastic : lot of
listeners *in : the tearoom \ laterâ and a
cup *of pink I tea. ~
It wouldn't be surprising if the ladies
elected Mr. James a club member,
willy-nilly.
