he promised to dump this amount of

he was carrying such blocks of
ctocks. As the notices uere published.
however, no subjunctive conditions
were made concerning his threat to on
load these specialties. Consequently
the trading element was impatient to
know whether the financier proposed to
make good his threat. Members of the
Stock Exchange received during the
morning- a correct copy of his "latest"
when it was seen that the notice was
steply a press agent's hodge podge of
words.
From the manner in which the stock
market acted in the three stocks
named. It appears that Lawson did sell
a few thousand shares of the stocks.
Then he called' la hia stenographer and
dictated the following advertisement:
"After carefcHy going over mj ac-
counts I find that those statements
which were published in the early part
of the week to the effect that I was
loaded to the gunwales with Amalga
mated Copper, Sugar and Pacific and
would be obliged to throw them over
board or be ruined, were erroneous. I
therefore withdraw my request for as
sistance and assure mjt old Wall
street associates that I find myself to
day, as during every other day in the
last thirty-five years, ready to render
them any favors they may require."

"WILKESBARRE, Pa., Nov. 23.â
Five masked robbers broke into the
house of aged Mrs. Rose Farley at
Luzerne this morning and in an effort
to find money tortured her and her
granddaughter. Annie. The men
forced an entrance about 3 o'clock,
smashing In the door, using a rail
road tie as a battering ram. Mrs. Far
ley and her granddaughter were in
bed together. Three of the men thrust
revolvers in their faces and threatened
to kill them if they made a noise.
Mrs. Farley was then asked where
she. had her money hidden. She told
them $20 was all she had. They found
it and $1 50 in small change, but they
thought the old woman had more and
held matches to her bare feet until the
grandchild, in an effort , to save her
grandmother Â¦ from further torture, de
clared she knew where the money was
hidden.
She hoped to lead the robbers into
the yard, escape from them and arouse
the neighbors. But they kept so close
about her she could not get away. The
girl told them to dig at a. certain spot
and they dug for some time. Then they
decided that . she was deceiving them.
She was taken back to the house,
bound hand - and foot, kicked and
braised and thrown into a corner.
The robbers in a last effort to induce
Mrs. Farley to tell them about the hid
den money started to fire the house.
They ignited the lace curtains, but
pulled them down before the flames
spread. They ransackea the house
thoroughly, but found nothing more,
and then departed.

Â¦ThÂ« American Federation of Labor
decided yesterday that It Is inexpedient
to attempt at this time to bring the
labor organizations cf the city and
county cf San Francisco together in
one organization. A commute reported
against the plan and indicated therein
that it had experienced a rather lively
time while listening to the members of
the organizations who had attended the
deliberations of the committee as wit
nesses. There 13 no donbt that thi3 i3
the truth. The convention adopted the
committee's report, and so disposed of
the proposition for the present year.
Much to the astonishment cf many,
there ,was no debate on the report. Not
one man in the convention cared to say
a word or did say a word about the
merits of the case.
Officials of local labor organizations
who have been conspicuously extending
the glad hand to delegates dorlnj- the
last few days of the convention were In
evidence in Lyric Hall when the report
was submitted late yesterday after
noon. They watched and listened, but
affected no surprise at what took place.

Lieutenant Granville A. Fortescue
fought an impromptu one-round go
with a hackman while he was In this
city on his return from the Orient a
month ago. The President's nephew
would have won first money in the en
counter had not Policeman Handley
Interfered and arrested him. Six
hours in the City Prison took most of
the valor out of the pugnacious lieu
tenant.
The entanglement occurred In front of
the Techau Tavern. Fortescue was
celebrating his return in the tavern,
but he became so noisy that he had to
be requested to leave. Outside he quar
reled with S. G. Lowenberg, a hackman,
and handed him several stiff punches
before the policeman could interfere.
All the details of the battle are not
available, but it is known that the next
round was fast, the President carefully
watching his adversary. Finally the
President "got to him." He sent a
couple of hot blows to the lieutenant's
head and cut loose with another one.
It was all over for the ' lieutenant.
Whether he was entirely knocked out
and unconscious cannot be learned, but
it Is a fact that the mill ended with a
good hard blow the President landed
on Fortescue's jaw. Lieutenant Fortes
cue showed marks of punishment next
day, but they were slight, not painful
nor serious.

again turned to thoughts of boxing. It
is more vigorous than anything else,
and he rejoices in a stiff three rounds
â¢with five-ounce gloves.
Lieutenant Fortescue was a corporal

man cf high spirits and good physique,
about the President's height and reach,
but considerably lighter and quicker on

from a trip to the Far East. He
coached the President so thoroughly on
Japan that Prince Fushimi, the adopt

and gratified at the President's knowl

When the President and Lieutenant
Fcrtescue squared off the younger man
rtarted to cut out a hot pace. His leads
were swiJt and straight and sometimes
effective, but the President, doggedly
standing his ground against the lieu
tenant's rushes, sent in heavy counters.

ROOSEVELT AN EXPERT
WITH THE GLOVES
INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 25.â After
traversing Pennsylvania, West Virgin
ia, Ohio and Indiana, President Roose
velt is speeding across Illinois toward
St. Louis, where for two days he and
his party will be the guests of the of
ficers of the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position. During the ride from Wash
ington to Indianapolis the President
was received everywhere with enthu
siasm. Since daylight to-day every sta
tion, through which the special passed
was. thronged with people anxious to
catch a glimpse of the President. Stops
were made only at given stations and
at some of them hundreds had gath
ered to greet the President and show
their kindly feeling for him.
Both to the members of his party on
this train and to the people President
Roosevelt expressed the sincere pleas
ure he feels in thus coming: into close
touch with those whom he likes to re
gard as his friends.
ADDRESS AT PITTSBURG.
The President thoroughly enjoyed the
rest he had to-day, which was spent
chiefly In reading and in chatting with
Mrs. Roosevelt. At nearly every sta
tion where the train slowed up the
President appeared on the rear plat
form of his car and bowed acknowl
edgment to the cheerings of the peo
ple. At Plttsburg, where the train
stopped for a few minutes, the station
was thronged, but only a fraction of
the crowd was permitted on the plat
form near the train. To them the
President expressed his pleasure at the
opportunity afforded him to see them
and added, "You may depend on it, I
will do all that in me lies to show you
that you made no mistake on Novem
ber 8."
T.Tiile the train ran through Pitts
burg President Roosevelt remained on
the rear platform of his car, bowing
and waving his hat to the people. The
windows of factories and shops along
the line were filled with faces of work
men, who cheered and waved hats.
At Steubenville, Ohio, the station plat
form was banked with men, women
and children, most of whom -waved
A'merican flags.
PRESENTED WITH A COON.
A live coon was presented to the
President at Dennlson, where the spe
cial stopped for a few minutes. After
the President had greeted the people, a
man swung the coon over the railing
of the car platform and shouted:
"Take him; he will bring you good
luck."
When the President laughed and
shook his head deprecatlngly, the man
again shouted: "You must take him.
I am a life-long Democrat and I wish
you good luck."
Attached to the chain around the an
imal's neck was a card bearing this
Inscription:
"Compliments of Tuscarawas Coun
ty, Ohio. Plurallty^for Roosevelt 2224.
Presented by P. O. Strope, Dennison,
Ohio." ..::;-
The coon will be taken to Washing
ton and placed in the national zoologi
cal park.
When the train pulled into the sta
tion at Columbus, the President's car
was surrounded by an immense crowd.
The President was cheered heartily as
he stepped on the platform. He said:
"I want to say what a pleasure it is
to me to be traveling through your
great State and perhaps you will par
don me for saying it, but I enjoyed
even more what you did November 8."
PLEASED WITH INDIANA.
Governor Herrick and", Mayor Jeffries
entered the car and formally extended
to the President the greetings of the
people of the State. A woman in the
crowd handed a member of the party
a bunch of American beauty roses for
Mrs. Roosevelt.

"WASHINGTON. Nov. 25.â Not for all
the peers in England will this Govern
ment surrender the name of American.
Sir Edward Clarke at the Thanksgiv
ing dinner c* the American Society in
London decided Joseph H. Choate's
title "American" Embassador. He de
clared It was aa assumption cf domi
nation ci the entire Western Hemis- '
phere fcr tie United States to call it
eelf America, when in fact it possesses
less territory in North America than
does England. As a more appropriate
rame he suggested â¢â¢Usonia."
Officials here snap their fingers at Sir
Edward Clarke's suggestion. They will
have none of it. It is not the first
time that British distaste for the use
cf the name America by this Govern
ment has been heard. When Secretary
Hay, several months ago, instructed all
rr.errbers cf the diplomatic service to
term themselves "The American En
hz.ssz.ior" or "The American Minister"
Instead of "United States Embassa
dor," etc., much comment was occa
sioned thereby.
Bat the right of the use of the name
is undeniable according to officials
here. It is pointed out that the name
adopted by the colonies In their con
stitution was the "United States of
America." Canada is known as the Do
minion of Canada. The full name of
Mexico is the United States of Mexico;
of Colombia, the United States of Co
lombia; of Venezuela, the United
States of Venezuela. These countries
call themselves respectfully Mexico.
Colombia and Venezuela. The respec
tive adjectives are Mexican, Colombian
and Venezuelan.
The name of this country Is only
contained in the word "America," and
the exercise cf its use is considered
unassailable and in no need of defense,
no matter what criticism is uttered.
â¢Â¦Usona" is made up of the first letter
of the words in the phrase
"United States of North Ameri
ca." The name of this country is not
the United States of North America. It
is the United States of America. Be
sides "Usona" is considered a catch

peach his honesty, Integrity, virtue and
reputation. The objectionable story is
to the effect that Dodge while a mem

assess its property. It further â¢ states
that when Gavin McNab retired frortj
the club, one year ago, Dodge placed an
assessment of $500 on the club's be

eral hours. The forenoon session was
extended to get in all the talk, but
that expedient proved to be fruitless.
Accusations and denials followed
one another closely and hostilities
were clearly denned. When the con
vention resumed work yesterday
morning there was before it a long
report, previously published in full in
this paper, but here given in epitome
that the full transaction of yesterday
may be entirely comprehended.
The report embraced recommenda
tions to the effect that all brewery
employes, now members of the United
Brewery Workmen's Union, may re
main such, provided that such mem
bcrt; of the union .as are now employed
as engineers, firemen or teamsters
may withdraw and join their respec
tive unions without prejudice or dis
crimination on the part of their for
mer associates; that all engineers,
ntemen and teamsters employed in
breweries shall conform to the laws
xrade by the organization of which
the majority of the members of the re
Â¦pectlve crafts employed in the brew
ery are members; the United Brewery
Workmen's Union shall not hereafter
admit to membership any engineer,
fiieman or teamster, but shall refer all
ajplicanis who are members of these
trades to the respective organizations
o: these trades now affiliated with the
American Federation of Labor, where
such organizations exist; that failure
to comply with these and other pro
visions shall work a revocation of
charter in six months.
After a long, bitter fight the con
vention adopted this report just as it
Â¦was submitted. An attempt was made
to strike out that part of the recom
mendations in the committee report
prohibiting the admission of engineers,
firemen and teamsters to the Brewery
"Workmen's Union, but the convention
voted the motion down strongly.
ADDS TO TIIK FIRE.
In fact more anger was stirred in
the minds of the brewery workmen
by the adoption of the following that
was submitted by James A. Lavery.
formerly president of the Working
men's Federation of the State of New
York, one of the bright speakers of
the convention:
add to provision 6 Â«of the committee'* report)
that the executive council is hereby Instructed
to execute this mandate:
That the fnltM Brewery Workmen be com.
ptlled to withdraw those engineer* and tire
irten who have taken the r'Â»<"** of the striking
engineer* and fireirwn in the cities of St. Louis- ,

that the L'nited Brewery Workers be requested
to trithdriw all injunction #ults now pendlnr
and to di*sclve such Injunction* a* have been
secured apainM. the affiliated union* of the
American Federation of Labor.
Before the matter was finally settled
Mshon. of the street carmen, intro
duced the following which was lost on
vote:
Be It resolved. That the incoming executive
council U hereby ir.Mrm.ted to carry out the

After exchanging a few pleasantries
with the people and bidding them good
night, the President retired to his
stateroom amid tremendous cheering.
The crowd remained at the station and
cheered the train until it had disap
peared.

"Not a thing," answered the Presi

Leaning over the rail, the President
asked, "What's the matter with Mis

Deafening cheers greeted the ques

The special train arrived at the sta

Roosevelt stood on the platform of the

applause had subsided the President
expressed his pleasure at being able to

"I have always thought a great deal

President Samuel Gompers, accom
panied by Max Morris. W. D. Mahon,
II. W. Sherman, Henry Ketter, J. C.
Shannessy, David Kreyling and other
Eastern luminaries of the convention,
paid a visit to the San Francisco La
bor Council last night. In a fifteen
minute speech he covered the aims
and objects of the labor movement.
After disposing of this theme he
branched out on the San Francisco
labor organizations and regetted that
the labor bodies in this city are not
as united as they should be.
He dwelt on the existence of the
Labor Council as being the principal
center body representing all that is
good and great in the labor move
ment. This body, or one similar to it,
should in his opinion, have affiliated
with it all other labor organizations
in the city. The division whtfh. now
exists between the Labor Council the
Building Trades Council and the City
Front Federation is a source of great
grief to him and to all lovers of har
mony in the ranks of unionized labor.
He saw no hope of a reconciliation be
tween these contending elements, all
weakened because they are not in
unity. He paid a high compliment to
the hospitality of the people of Cali
fornia.
He Expresses Regret That Organiza
tions in San Francisco Are Not
United.
GOMPERS VISITS LABOR COUNCIL
NEW YORK, Nov. 25.â J. Morgan
Smith, the brother-in-law of "Nan"
Patterson and the man who is said to
have" purchased the revolver with which
Caesar Young, the bookmaker, was
killed, was arrested to-day shortly be
ford noon in West Nyack, N.,Y., by De
tective Sergeant Judge of the central
office staff. Smith is now locked up in
a cell in police headquarters.
Smith is the witness for whom the
District Attorney and the police have
been hunting ever since the criminal
authorities decided to prosecute "Nan",
Patterson on the charge of having mur
dered Young while riding downtown
with him In a cab on they morning of
June 4 last.
Smith disappeared at the time the
Coroner's inquest into the death of the
bookmaker was. going on. He was re
garded by the prosecution as its most
important witness, and extraordinary
efforts .were made to find him. No trace
of the man was found until three days
ago, when a clew was discovered by
the central office men who were en
gaged In the search.
In the opinion of the lawyers defend
ing "Nan" Patterson the District Attor
ney will be unable tg prove a case suf
ficiently strong against their client to
warrant Judge Davis in submitting the
matter to the jury's consideration.
They have hopes that it will be un
necessary for any defense to be offered.
This opinion, however, is not held by
other members of the criminal bar who
have followed closely the testimony
that has been given thus far.
One of her lawyers said to-day that
if any testimony Is to be submitted by
the defense "Nan" Patterson would be
placed on the stand to tell ; her own
story of exactly what took place be
tween herself and Caesar Young while
they were occupants of the hansom In
which Young was shot. He said fur
ther that testimony would be given
which would show that It was not the
Patterson girl's brother-in-law, J. Mor
gan Smith, .who purchased the revolver
at . Hy man 'Stern's pawnshop in Sixth
avenue the day before the shooting.
Rand does not believe_that "Nan"
Patterson will be permitted to take the
witness stand to undergo a cross-exam
ination that would be merciless! When
the trial is resumed Rand will offer tes
timony to establish the motive that he
holds caused the shooting.
"Nan" Patterson had an uneventful
day In the Tombs to-day. Her father
and her lawyer were her only visitors.
She daily receives letters. Two in her
mail yesterday bcrre offers of farmers
to marry her. - .
A new and important witness, whose
identity thus far has been carefully
concealed, will be brought forward by
the prosecution, according to a story
which gained circulation to-day. Be
yond the statement that the witness
is a woman, that she is young and
that she was well acquainted with both
Young and the woman now on trial, the
report was Indefinite. Of the nature of
the disclosure which the witness is ex
pected to make nothing could be
learned. That the testimony is con
dered of great importance by the pros
ecution, however, seems apparent.
According to the report the woman is
consta-ntly under the guard of detec
tives. The calling of this mysterious
woman to the witness chair is said to
be only one of the many startling fea
tures â¢ of Assistant District Attorney
Rand's case.
Almost of the same importance to
the strength of his chain of evidence
are several documents he has obtained
possession of since Miss Patterson has
been a prisoner in the Tombs. It has
been claimed since the arrest of the
young woman that the prosecutor had
secured possession of letters which, it
is alleged, show that the defendant
made threat against the life of Young,
but the documents, which it is said
will be produced as a complete sur
prise, are of a different character. -

Is ,Brother-in-Law of the
Actress and Is Accused
of Purchasing Pistol With
Which Young Was Killed
LOCATED IN WEST
NYACK, -NEW YORK
Mr. Wignall, who for the past seven
years has been a member of the board
of education in Swansea, said that he
was astonished to find the public
schools , here far behind those of
Wales. Pupils are herded in bare
walled classrooms and the impression
given is that the schools are being
starved for want of money.
Mr. Abraham's address was more
along labor lines. He said that, the
condition of the workingmen in Wales,
thanks to organization, is such that
were he a miner seeking employment
he would not come to the United
States. It is true, he says, that the
workingmen here receive more in
actual cash, but the purchasing power
is not so great. He also expressed
himself as opposed to the teaching of
religion in the day schools. He deem
ed the church and Sunday school the
proper place for the teaching of re
ligion, and said a labor leader who
was not connected with a Sunday
school w r as not worth his salt.
Abraham, M. P., familiarly known as
"Mabon," and James Wignall, the two
fraternal delegates from Wales to the
Federation of Labor Convention, by
the Cymrodorion Society in Academy
of Sciences Hall last night. The hall
was filled and an excellent programme,
much of it in the Welsh tongue, was
rendered. Reese P. Daniels, president
of the club, acted as chairman and
among the speakers were Rev. Samuel
Slocombe, Rev. John Rhys Evans and
Rev. David J. Evans. A piano solo
was rendered by Miss Annie Jones,
and vocal solos were given by David
Manlloyd and Gomer Richards. The
speakers of the evening, of course,
were the two guests of honor.
RECEPTIOXTO DELEGATES.
Delegate Mahon objected to the plan
an giving the central labor unions too
much power In their Jurisdictions. Del
egates Driscoll and Wilson argued in
favor of the amendment. The recom
mendation of the law committee was
finally concurred in by a majority vote.
This concluded the report of the law
committee, which was accepted as a
whole and the committee was then dis
charged. Following the report of the
committee an adjournment was had
until 9 o'clock this morning.
Matters -relating to tne longshoremen
will be made a special order this morn-
Ing. This afternoon the annual elec
tion of officers of the American Fed
eration will take place. The conven
tion will close to-day. . â¢ .
' A resolution directing that all affili
ated national and international unions
compel their local unions to join the
central -labor, bodies and State federa
tions In the vjclnity In which they ex
ist was amended by the laws com
mittee.-,The amendment provided that
the' union might have representatives
in the central labor toodles and State
federations, but that those organiza
tions would not be allowed to send spe
cial delegates to the conventions of the
Federation of Labor as representing the
several unions.
Delegate Brown of Seattle deplored
the fact that the Socialists were re
ferred to by President Gompers during
th" afternoon session as opponents.
Brown was interrupted frequently In
his preliminary remarks by loud talking
and "joshing" despite the efforts of
Gcmpers to maintain quiet. Brown
finally appealed- to -the delegates - to
maintain quiet and give him a fair
hearing.
Delegate Ramsey argued in favor of
supporting the, recommendation of the
law committee, that the legislative
committees should not be abolished,
and said that tie hoped the time would
come when every State capital and
every city Vould have representative
labor men watching .the legislative pro
ceedings. The report or t&e committee
was sustained. " ' ..
A resolution directing that- no dele
gate holding a political 'position shall
be seated on the floor of the convention
was not ratified by the law committee
and the resolution was rejected ; by the
convention.
At the evening meeting the law com
mittee continued Its report on a resolu
tion to abolish the legislative commit
tees.
"The inconsistency of union labor's
opponents," said Gompers, "both in
and out of the federation, is shown
by the fact that in one breath they
ask the abolition of the legislative
committee and then ask Congress to
pension aged laboring men.
"I deny that the labor movement is
against political action, but it is
against transforming itself into a po
litical machine."
AX EVENING SESSION.
Delegate Barnes objected to having
his remarks called a sneering tirade,
to which Gompers replied that the ac
tions of many delegates are different
when they are out of the convention
than when they are in.
â¢"The reports of the hearings before
Congress are published and I chal
lenge any man to produce any remark
or action that was not a bold assertion
of labor's rights or was cringing or a
demeaning of the character of dig
nity."
Delegate Iglesias of Porto Rico ad
dressed the convention on the sub
ject of conditions in Porto Rico. He
asserted that the people are worse off
than they were before the American
occupation of the country: that wages
are lower and that starvation is con
tinually destroying the people.
Yesterday afternoon the Socialists
took another chance in the conven
tion. Barnes, in a Socialistic speech,
spoke of lobbies and urged that the
labor men rely on economic organlza-.
tion.
Treasurer Lennon took the chair
while President Gompers made reply.
He spoke of the effect that the legis
lative committee had in preventing in
iquitous legislation. He added that
sneering tirades against legislative
committees and officers of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor should
cease.
PORTO RICAX SPEAKS.
Delegates Archie Grant, Buchanan,
Kemper, Ward, Greenlaw. Lewis,
Warner. Sharnp. Henry Ketter. Dris
coll. Porter, Jacoby and others took
part in the proceedings, on one side
or the other.
Lavary, speaking on the other side
of the house and regarding injunc
tions and the general attitude of -the
brewery workmen said in part:
It !s not a question of sympathy, and cer
tainly ought not to be one of expediency, but
to my mind it is a question of oppression o:i
the part of thÂ» brewery workers. The creatura
la not sreater than ltc creator, nor ore the
brewery workers paramount to the American
Federation of Labor. We have always been
opposed to the principle of injunction. The
subordinate body should always recognize the
bodâ to this case In Us opposition to In
junction. If the brewery workers approve of
the continuance of the injunction it is an
attempt to assert the impotency of the fed.
eration. It attempts to attribute uselessncss
to it; it proclaim* defiance to Its principles
and almost invites rebellion within its ranks
if it does not welcome disorder and secession.
We cannot be so glaringly Inconsistent as
to approve of their injunction tactics and
thereby destroy all discipline in the American
Icbor movement. The outride world is watch
ing with great interest the decision of this
ouesttor. and the approval of the injunction
would mean the beginning of the end of the
greatest organization In the industrial world's
history. Disapproval of their injunction tac
tic* simply means respect for law and dis
cipline.
right to put. somebody Into our organization
that Â»"â¢ don't deFire. for we would get an ele
ment into cur organization that xve coul'l not
perhaps trust nnd we want all to work in
hermony in our organization. But, instpad of
bringing harmony, such action as that con
templated by the American Federation of
L,\bor at the present time would disharmoniie
everything in the brewery workers' organiza
tion and also in the teamsters, engineers and
firemen. This Is what 1 want to say In sup
port 01 the amendment to this recoinmeniift
ti< n. I hope that eavh and every delegate
se<-s the risht and justice In the claim that
the Ameilcan federation thou'.d not have the
power to go Into the autonomy of any or
ganization, which is guaranteed to It by the
cherter and the constitution. I don't think
there is any organization that v.ould stanJ

Every day I am in receipt of dozens
of letters from people from out of
town who have heard of my famous
cure for the drink habit and who
write to know if I cannot send it by

I answer No.
The reason is simple. Excessive
drinking affects no two men alike;
neither are two men ever in exactly
the same- physical condition. Then,
again, complications arise from drink-
ing. Every case needs and must have
individual treatment â no two cases
are alike.
Every man who comes to any of my

of the highest skilled^ physician and
my cure is administered to suit such

all standard, remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many U2eful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annuallyMo the well informed purchasers of the choi cest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in cases of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habits, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs, and they are gla4 to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction. y â¢ Â¦
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be found, hers and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations, in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have the nameâ " Syrup of Fig3"â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious" fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate as to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and deception in one case he will do bo with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians* prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company-
California Fig Syrup Co.â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class of
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

Though the condition of Albert de
Rome, student of Mark Hopkins Insti
tute of Art. is reported serious, it is
held by students that the "ordeals"
were rrJId. The instrument used is said
to be a weak magnetic battery â so
weak that the full strength of the cur
rent can scarcely be felt.
Young De Rome's story that he
tegrged to be released is firmly denied
by the students.
De Rome went to the studio of Dougr- ,
las Fras*Â»r, â¬11 Clay street, to be ini
tiated into the life class. It is said that
he seemed to enter into the spirit of
the occasion. Besides De Rome there
was another candidate for initiation,
Eugene E. Sr.eed. He was put through
the same ordeals as De Rome, but "was
rot injured in any way. The initiation
committee consisted of George Hol
combe. Henry BarndoIIar, Douglas
Fraser, Armin C. Kansen. Jackson
Hatch. J. Sherwood and H. Foss.
In the old studio once tenanted by
some of the most famous artists of
other days the boys amused themselves
at the f-xpense of the neophytes. Sneed
and De Rome were stripped to their
undergarments. One at a time they
were bound to an "electric chair." which
has been described as '"the same as is
used at Sing- Sing." A current so slight
that it could be hardly felt was turned
on. This is an old initiation custom of
the Hcpkir.s students and is called "the
muscle dance."
When De Rome was subjected to it.
say the students, he did not complain,
but when his bonds were cut he was
unable to rise without help.

When seen at his residence, 1076
Fifty-ninth street, Oakland, Louis de
Rome, the uncle of Albert de Rome,
said:
The facts ?jxÂ»aJc for themselves. The boy
is almost paralyzed from the waist down and
is now under the care of a dortor. He tells
me his injury was caused by repeated ihocks
of electricity while hÂ» was bein? "initiated"
by some of the students at the institute. Of
count I do not b'arr.e the directors of the
whool for the trouble, but I do believe that
things of this kind should be stopped. The
boy will be under the doctor's caj-e for some
time and will be under heavy expense, and If
I find that his injury was caused by this so

Yesterday he went to District "Attor
ney Byington to ask advice with the
view of prosecuting the hazers. By
ineton said that if young De Rome's
injury was permanent the offenders
could be charged with mayhem; if not
the offense was battery. Louis de
Rome says that he will prosecute the
hazing party.
â¢"I've had lumbago for four years,"
replied De Rome. "I guess I have an
other attack. I get one now and then.
It will go away soon. "
""Why didn't you tell us?" was asked.
"Vfe would have let you off from the
muscle dance if you had."
"You might have thought I was try
ing to get out of it," De Rome replied.
Though De Rome walked with some
difficulty, he was able to leave the
studio, declining assistance that was
eagerly proffered. He attended school
the next day, but later his condition
became worse asd lit -3 physician. Dr.
Charles Clark, advised him to go to

in making a general advance had
pushed back the Japanese left a dis
tance of three miles are wholly un

The situation remains entirely un

that both armies have doubtless
strengthened their defenses and accu

The Russians continue their recon

but there has been no general engage
ment or change In the Japanese in
trenched positions.
The Japanese continue to ignore the

of the central army, and In many places
the whole line of trenches are so close
that the Japanese can draw fire at any

ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 26. 3:30 a.

for a desperate assault on Port Ar

Baltic squadron is quite generally cred

has been expected to- transpire a3 soon

and a party of British financiers, who
in one way or another represent mil
lions of English capital that is invested
in commercial enterprises in this coun

are Sir Ernest Cased!, a member c-f
the Privy Council of England, who is
accredited with being one of the closest
advisers of King Edward in matters of
finar.ee; Robert Fleming:, through
whom much British capital has been
invested in American railways; Valen

U. S. A., retired, of New York, who is
an intimate friend of Banker Schiff.
Leaving here to-morrow the party
expects to stop over at the Hotel del
Monte for a few hours before embark
ing on their trip down the coast to
Santa Barbara.
The Schiff party was met at Ogderi
by Acting General Manager Bancroft
and Chief Engineer Hood of the South

running time of the special train so
that the distinguished travelers could
cross the Lucln cut off and view from
the* rear end of their train Engineer
Hood's wonderful achievements in

various work /recently completed for
the purpose of straightening out the
line was pointed out.
Arriving ,here the party lunched
at the Paciflo-Union Club and then
went to the Claus Spreckels building,
from the top of which the Britishers
were afforded a blrdseye view of San
Francisco. From there they returned
to the St. Francis Hotel long enough
to permit Banker Sehlff to receive and
answer a number of telegrams and then
they were driven throusn Golden Gate

Boy Accidentally Killed.
CHICO, Nov. 25.â Willie Bayon, â¢ son
of a well-known resident of Biggs, was
accidentally killed while out hunting
.with two young companions yesterday.
He was climbing a. fence when -the
hammer of his gun caught on a board
end a charge of goose shot | was sent
through his body/causing instant death.
"I object, to this letter being intro
duced as evidence," began Judge Pi
per. "It shows business relations
about which I know nothing and
whicft have nothing to do with this
case."
"I want to show what these rela
tions were," suggested Heney.
"By those letters?"
"Yes, and by the testimony of this
witness."
Judge Bellinger then adjourned the
court in order to give Judge Piper a
chance to outline his objections. To
morrow he will present his point and
take the ruling of the court. In the
meantime Hobson is waiting on the
witness stand to tell what he knows
about the relations of McKinley and
Puter.
"The purpose of this letter, if it
please the court," said Attorney
Heney, "will be to show the relations
existing between Puter and McKinley
in a social and a business way. The
prosecution Is now starting on a new
line of evidence tending to connect
these defendants with the case. I
have told the Witness to be present
In the morning and would suggest
that the court adjourn until that
time."
In the meantime the defense was
clustered about the letter.
PORTLAND, Nov. 25.â Another sup
port in the superstructure of the Gov
ernment's evidence in the trial of the
land fraud cases was supplied to-day
in the testimony of Robert G. Pierce,
one of the surveying party which ac T
companied A. W. Barber . on his tour
of examination of the claims. His tes
timony was an exhaustive account in
detail of the trips made by the party
during the six days Â¦ they "Scrambled
through the virgin forests of Township
11 south. Range 7 east, in search of
homestead improvements, which cer
tain documents on file in the land office
make it appear were made. The testi
mony of Pierce was corroborative of
that of Barber, given yesterday, but it
was stronger , in the respect that the
witness to-day testified that for ten
years he had resided on a homestead
of his own. in this exclusive territory,
and during that time saw hot one sight
which led him to believe that any such
personages as those whose names now
figure in court ever lived on the claims
to which they are accredited by pat
ents issued by the Gerferal Land Office.
The line of has changed.
The old story of geography, that has
taken all of the week in the telling, has
given way to the story of the business
and other relations 'of the defendants,
and some startling tales are looked for
at the session of to-morrow. The past
life of the defendants, where they have
been and how and what they have done
and what relation each bears to the
others in business and private life will
be the burden of the testimony brought
out for the knowledge of the court and
jury.
Edwin Hobson of Eugerrte, the last
witness of the day, testified as to his
knowledge of the relations existing
between Marie^Ware, Horace McKin
ley and Clyde Lloyd. Witness had
never met S. A. D. Puter, but volun
teered the ioformation that he had
received a letter from him in con
nection with the case of McKinley and
Lloyd. A storm of objections follow
ed this statement. Witness produced
the letter and more objections were
offered.

The deep gravel mines of Calaveras County
are ancient river beds," which can be traced
for miles through this and adjoining ooun
tias. Their course is not Influenced In the
least ' by the mountains and valleys at the
present day. The rivers had defined channels
In the bedrock. The whole country was then
overflowed with lava, covering up the streams.
The depth at which these channels are found
varies with the locality. The gravel in the
channel is from a few feet thick to several
hundred. All, * or nearly all of this, carries
gold. The richest Is mostly found on the bed
rock, though deposits of rich gravel have been
found just under the lava capping. The gravel
consists principally of decomposed serpentine,
schist, granite, quartzite, slate and quartz.
This decomposition, especially of the serpen
tine, has formed a clayey cement, binding thÂ»
pebblet and bowlders of quartz bo hard that
milling Is neceesary to release the values. The
usual practice in milling in this neighborhood
la to dump the mass as It comes from the
mine onto an Inclined grizzly. The fine sep
arates and sroes directly to the storage bin.
The lumps fall onto a horizontal grizily. ThÂ«
largest of the quartz bowlders are sorted out
by hand and thrown over the dump. The
clayey chunks are broken up with hammers till
all will pass through the grlzry into the bin.
Twenty stamps of the Ballol mill,
near Sutter Creek, will be moved to the
Lampheer mine, at Spring Gulch, near
Mokelumne Hill, Calaveras County, to
be operated. , V T :

Now under way is the work of putting In
a pipe line from the storage plant to the
Salt Lake wells, a. franchise for which was
granted to the latter company some time ago.
This line will be used by the Associated to
bring oil to the city. A large force of men
is now at work.
The statement published in the Times a few
days since that it is not the intention of the
Associated to bring more Bakersfleld oil hÂ»rÂ«
at the present time was confirmed recently
by an oil man In touch with officials of the
company, who pointed out that with. the pros
pecta of oil Koine up at Kern River It Is not
likely that it can be shipped here at a reason
able price unless the combine is either able to
produce It from its property or make Im
mediate low contracts with independents. It
is not believed that it can at present get
sufficient from its own properties to supply
any very lane contracts here, together with
those which It already has with the Southern
Pacific and In Ban Francisco. If this is the
case H Is thought to be very likely that the
combine will be seeking to acquire other prop
erties in the fields south of the Tehachapi
and that it will also do business as a pur
chaser of oil from independents here as lt\does
at Kern River, McKittrick and Coalinga,
where t it is already the main factor in the
fuel oil business. At McKittrick It has un
disputed sway; at Kern River It has 60 per
cent of the production and handles large
amounts of Independent oil, and at Coallngn
it has acquired the Southern Pacific pipe lines
and is branching out most extensively. Sev
eral well-informed oil men have expressed the
opinion that within a comparatively short time
the Associated will be occupying as Important
a position in the southern fields and market
as It already does in the north. ,

. In entering into the local oil Industry, the
Associated Company has not only obtained
ccntrol of the Salt LÂ»ake Company's' wells, but
has also acquired the entire plant of the Oil
Storage and Transportation Company, through
which it will handle the sale and distribution
in Los Angeles. The plant Is at Alhafnbra
and Bloom streets, where there Is tankage to
the amount of 1<H),QOO barrels, and at which
point the oil storage company has engaged in
the business of purchasing and storing oil
from the local fields and supplying it to the
consumers. This business will now be taken
over by the Associated people represented in
this city by C. A. Canfleld, a director of the
combine.
The Associated. Oil -Company has
moved largely on the Los, Angeles mar
ket, and the Los Angeles Times says:
Concerning recent peculiarities of
gold-dredging in Butte County the Oro
ville Register says:
When the dredger field was opened near
this town It was confidently asserted that the
tract where dredgers could work to advantage
was limited. There was only a certain dis
trict where the big boats would work the nand
and gravel. This was changed gTÂ«atly when
some new tracts were tested.' The El Oro
showed that land on the bluff could be worked,
and then a new aspect was put on the face
of dredger mining. Recently a good deal of
land south of town has been put under bonda,
and If the ' sale of- the same goes on, there
will be dredgers built to work the landa on the
Morrissey tract, on' the BÂ«vinÂ« tract and on
the land of Henry Downing, together with sev
eral other- pieces.
Eome of the land in so high that it will be
neceasary to work the tracts in sections. One
dredger will be on the ground floor, as It were,
another In the second story and a third on the
roof garden. It would be a curious sight to
9ee three dredgers, one at the base and an
other half way up, while the third was on
top of a hill, and all working, digging for gold.
At this rate all the bald hills south of Oro
ville and almost down to Palermo are liable
to become dredging ground.
DREDGERS CLIMB HILLS.
A great boom in the gravel mining
region in the northwestern part of Am
ador County. is predicted. The Amador
Dispatch says that on the flat lands and
in many of the valleys of the lower
foothills there are enormous deposits of
gold-bearing graveUfrom ten to thirty
feet in depth;. In; the northern part of
the county the old river channel and
gravel beds" begin about six mlleB below
Plymouth and run ten miles west to
the Cosumnes River, three miles south
of Michigan Bar. The Dispatch says:
The gravel deposits of thlÂ» old channel vary
in places from a half to tnreÂ«-quartorÂ» of a
mile In widthâ in some place* they axe even
a mile wide, and on the north side of these
gravel hllla runs Arkansas creek, famous for
the richnees of its diggings In the early fifties
â $50 and $76 a day to the man to the rocker
being nothing uncommon. Immense tracts of
this land, owing to its flat nature, although
rich In gold in the flat places, were unfit for
hydraullcJking as the tailings could not ba
got away and the ranch owners would not
permit drifting, as they claimed the dumps
and tailings spoiled the agricultural value of
their â¢ land. To-day these lands and - many
others are being eagerly sought after for
dredging purposes. In many places the gravel
on these lands is eaid to be fifty to sixty fÂ«et
in depth/ - Â¦ ' .
Below Forest Home and opposite the school
house parties have recently sunk a shaft i In
the flat 'to a depth of forty-five feet, with a
handsome prospect In free goia, but they nave
not yet touched bedrock. The great gravel
hills and flats around Michigan Bar. on the
north 'side of Arkansas creek, from which
nearly $5,000,000 waf> taken In early days, are
also attracting considerable attention. ,
Below Carbondale and around lone thou
sands of acres of gravel have been bonded.
The great gravel beds around lone are coming
in ror their full Rhare of attention and before
long it will be a hard matter to find any good
gravel deposits of any extent that are not tied
up in eome way under either a bond or con
tract. It is safe to say, that at a rough esti
mate there are over 10,000 acres of gravel land
in the northwestern part of Amador County,
but whether or not all is fit for dredging the
Dispatch Is not prepared to say, although well
informed persona claim that a very large por
tion of these lands will pay to dredge.
E. H. Oliphant of the ynlted Btates
Geological Survey makes a general re
view of the petroleum industry of the
United States that gives the credit of
the great record-breaking production
of last year to the output of California,
which is now greater than that of any
other State, and in a lesser degree to
the increased production in Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana and
to the large production, of Texas.
The annual convention of the Califor
nia Miners' Association will open at the
Hotel St. Francis in this city on Decem
ber & and .will continue in session, with
various sightseeing trips included, until
December 8, inclusive of the last named
date. The general idea of the proceed
ings has previously been" outlined in
The Call. Papers on subjects of im
portance and interest to the miners will
be read. by persons who are recognized
as experts in their several lines. The
collection of essays will be an epitome
of modern mining methods as they. are
practiced in the pioneer gold-mining
State of California.
According to the Cripple Creek Times
the output of the Cripple Creek district
In October exceeded the total product
of September. The value of the ore
shipped was $2,043,900 for 61,850 tons.
The small cyanide plants treated a total
of 10,600 tons of ore containing values of
$49,900. '

Advised That Commis
sion Is. Again in Session
Congressional action having for Its
purpose the securing of an appropria
tion frum the. Government for the re
clamation of the inundated lands of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin basins
need not be long deferred. The exec
utive committee of the River Improve
ment and Drainage Association of Cal
ifornia has been. advised that the com
mission of engineers having this prob
lem in hand has reassembled at Sioux
City, Iowa, and. that its report may
be expected in December.
In connection with this work it has
been deemed advisable to secure the
best legal advice obtainable to look into
the present laws of- California and to
see what can be legally done In car
rying out the plans of tne engineers.
After careful consideration and inves
tigation and at the suggestion of the
executive committee of the River Im
provement and Drainage Association of
California the commissioner of publio
works appointed as legal advisers three
well known attorneys: Sheldon G. Kel
logg of San Francisco, A. L. Shlnn of
Sacramento and F. D. Nlcol of Stock
ton.
These attorneys are peculiarly fitted
for the work expected or them and
have already had a preliminary meet
ing with the executive committee. A
legal report will be had from the at
torneys in ample time, so that such
measures as are necessary may be pre
sented to the next Legislature. The
executive committee is gratified to find
that the interest in the movement of the
River . Improvement and Drainage As
sociation of California is maintained
and that the people generally are thor
oughly aroused to the necessity of
bringing about relief. California .will
be greatly benefited when the lands
tributary to the San Joaquin and Sac
ramento rivers are reclaimed.
The committee has also Deen in con
sultation with Mr. F. H. Newell, chief
engineer of the United States Geological
Survey and Mr. J. B. LJppincott, super
vising engineer of. the same service,
and the co-operation of this department
of the Federal Government Is assured.
When the president of the association
was in Washington he had an interview
with Secretary of War Taft, who ex
pressed himself as greatly interested
in the movement and gave assurance
of the hearty co-operation of. his de
partment.
The California delegation at Wash
ington is solid for river ; improvement
and drainage and with this united har
monious effort the success of the pres
ent movement undertaken by the River
Improvement and Drainage Associa

CALLS FOR CONVENTION.
California Water and Forest Associa
tion AMU Meet in December.
The annual convention of the Califor
nia Water and Forest Association has
been called to meet in this citv on
Friday, December 2. The convention
will assemble at 10:30 a. m. in the rooms
of the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce.
Reports of work done under the legis
lation secured by the association from
the last Legislature will .be presentedt
and plans for further work will be dis
cussed.
The approaching session of the Leg
islature makes the convention of high
importance to the irrigation and for
estry interests of the State, as it will
determine upon the legislation to be
pressed at Sacramento. A bill has been
prepared and will be submitted .to the
convention dealing with the problems
of preventing . forest fires, the extin
guishing of fires and the care of for
ested lands. The enormous losses each
year to the State and to owners of tim
ber land through conflagrations make
this bill one of great and immediate
importance. In its present form it pro
vides for a chief forester and assist
ants, and fire wardens in the various
districts.
The officers of the association are de
sirous that every county, city and dis
trict interested in the problems of for
est preservation as well as irrigation
send delegates to the convention in
structed to the wishes of the people in
regard to legislation.
Delegates are entitled to one and one
third fare for the round trip. They can
secure this by paying fare to San Fran
cisco, taking a receipt from the ticket
agent and having it indorsed by an of
ficer of the association identifying them
as delegates to the convention. â¢ This
will^ entitle them to returrK at one-third
fare*.
SUPREME COURT GIVES '
DECISION TO RAILROAD
The Supreme Court has decided that
S.- W.* Elliott, gets nothing but ex
perience, martyrdom or other abstract
attribute in compensation for having
been ejected from a Southern Pacific
train. The plaintiff was awarded
$700 as balm for his wounded feelings
by a Superior Court Judgment, but
that decision is reversed by the high
er tribunal.
Elliott bought a ticket from Pleas
anton to San Francisco and return
July 1894. The ticket was void
after July 6 of that year. The plain
tiff attempted to return ' within the
time limit, but was unable to do so
on account of the famous "A. R. U.
strike." When Elliott did catch a
train to Pleasanton on August 13,
1904, the conductor took up the ticket
in question and threw j out the pas
senger at San Leandro. The . plaintiff
suffering from "serious physical and
mental injury" sought first aid from
his lawyer and commenced suit for
damages.

When the Iris was on the sandbar
the passengers and crew jumped out

They suffered considerably from cold

at about $20,000.

near the mouth of this harbor under
peculiar circumstances. She was out

was fighting a Ftrong rising tide. Op
posite Prospect Point the tide was run
ning very swiftly through the narrows
and forced the Iris over to the oppo

sandbar with a list to starboard. Water
broke over her and she began to
fill. A freak of the tide floated her off
the sandbar, but she soon sank in
twenty fathoms of water.

COLFAX, Nov. 25.â Quite a little

Purser Walton of the Sierra reports
that on the morning of November 11 the
wind backed to the south and increased
to a heavy galeÂ» with a terrific high sea
running during the day. The wind grad
ually veered to the westward, blowing
very hard in squalls, the ship laboring
heavily and taking tremendous seas
over the bow. At 12 o'clock noon shÂ«
shipped a terrific sea forward, which
washed the cargo booms out of their
lashings and also started the hatch
battens on No. 1 hatch. It washed one
of the plugs out of the ventilator pipe
on the port side forward, broke the
flagpole off at the stem of the ship and
did other minor damage.
The gale continued to blow, with high
seas, until November 13. when it mod
erated. On November 14 and 13 there
was a very heavy sea from the north
west, with very little wind, the sea run
ning so high that it was almost break-
Ing on the crest, causing the ship to
roll heavily. From November 15 to port,
there was fine weather, with a light
breeze.
HONOLULU, Nov. 19.â The Oceanic

Lewis, does not think, the .Japanese
will ever take Port Arthur,' although
the Japanese themselves.; he â¢ says/; are
just ' as . sure â¢ : of . doing it as .< If ., the
Lewis does not believe that Japan
will be able to stand the financial
strain of a much longer continued war,
and he expresses the conviction that
ultimate Russian success is a'certainty.
As an evidence of Japanese confi
dence in the success of the Mikado's
arms Lewis spoke of .the calm assur
ance with which the little brown war
riors had programmed the campaign.
To such an extent has this been carried
out that as soon as the Japanese had
control of the railroad from Dalny, to
Port Adams they printed ' a : stock of
tickets covering the . system as 'far. as
Mukden.
RUSSIA WILI; SUCCEED.
Lewis was with the Japanese forces,
and it was as a result of his pluck and
enterprise that the New York Herald
and the San Francisco Call were able
to give to the world the first news of
the battle of Liaoyang. Lewis says that
the Japanese people are 'getting very
weary of the expense of the war. In
the first enthusiasm at the outbreak of
the war, he says, everybody wanted to
turn over all his money to the Govern
ment and to bind himself to pay more
as he earned it. It is different now.
The first popular loan, which was float
ed at a few per cent below par, was
nearly all subscribed by the populace.
The money kings of the land were sane
and safe in their patriotism, and when
the people rushed in to buy they stood
aside and reserved their coin for' the
second loan, when the bonds could be
secured at a much lower figure. '
Few of the original subscribers to the
first loan, 6ays Lewis, are now holding
the bonds. After making one or two
payments they turned over the obliga
tion to some more patriotic neighbor.
Many of the bonds have been, trans
ferred several times, and in many cases
the holder has been obliged to pay his
little brown brother to take the bonds
off his hands. The banks and big cor
porations took most of the second loan,
and the bonds of a third loan, Lewis
Qeclares, are moving very slowly.
WITH JAPANESE FORCES.
According to W. H. Lewis, a New
York Herald-San Francisco Call war
correspondent, who returned from the
Orient yesterday on the iiner Korea,
the Japanese have included the gentle
art of counterfeiting in their plans for
the confounding cf the Russian hosts.
The Trans-Siberian Railroad has all it
can do to carry troops and supplies of
food and ammunition without hauling
the trains of treasure necessary to fin
ance the big campaign if all disburse
ments were made in coin. Paper money,
therefore, is the only medium of ex
change circulating among the Czar's
tioops, and all purchases in Manchuria
are paid for in the ruble bills issued by
the Russian Government. Chinese and
others who have had dealings with
the Russians have grown to prefer this
convenient form of money to hard cash.
In order to discredit the Russian paper
money the Japanese have flooded the
country in which the Russians are op
erating with base imitations of these
royal promises to pay. The counterfeits
are so cleverly made that even the
Russian army paymasters have accept
ed some of them. The Japanese leaven
is working, and the Chinese merchants
are beginning to look askance at all
paper money.
Family Refuses to Discuss the Cxsc,

ST. LOUIS. Nov. 25. â Stephen Put
ney Jr., the son of a wealthy Rich
mond (Va.) shoe manufacturer, re
turned to-day to the Hamilton Hotel,
where his brother, Langhorne Putney,
is stopping, in company with a friend
of the family, who had been sent to
Kansas City to get him. His family
refuse to discuss his return, saying
that his explanation of his absence is
satisfactory and that they desire no
more publicity of the af'air.
Young Putney, when he so suddenly
disappeared, had with him jewels val
ued at more than $1000. and less than
$100 in money.
It was learned to-day that Putney
enlisted at the United States recruit
ing station in thiÂ«s city last Monday,
giving his age as 21 years. He was as
signed to the artillery service and re
quested that he be stationed at St.
Louis. He left for Jefferson Barracks,
near St. Louis, on Tuesday. R. N.
Williams and R. T. Hancock, a cousin
and friend of Putney's, who were in
Kansas City conducting the search for
him, started for St. Louis late to-day,
upon receipt of a telegram announcing
that he had returned there.

AUBURN, Nov. 25. â Adolph Weber
refused dinner again to-day. It is now
believed that if he was placed in sol
itary confinement and denied callers
for a few days his defiant manner
would soon change. He certainly
shows some signs of the mental strain
he is under. There is no truth in the
report that he has mr.de any sort of
an admission that would count against
him. There have been rumors of a
confession, but there has been none.
Weber still sticks to the same story
that he told Sheriff Keena and Cor
oner Sbepard tha morning after the
murder and later at the Coroner's in
quest. Weber's story of the route he
took on the night of the tragedy has
been contradicted by Misr, May Clark,
and his statement that he carried his
litUe brother out of the burning fire
has been shown to be untrue by
George Ruth, Clarence Geear. A. S.
Fleming. James Kenison and Guy L#u
kens. The rest of his story has not
been contradicted.
To-day has boen a very quiet day
!n the Weber case. There have been
no startling developments. Sheriff
Keena has not yet returned from San
Francisco, where he went in search
of the person who sold the fatal pistol.
The blood-stained waistcoat is still
missing and Vice President Lubeck's
offer of $1000 reward has not brought
him the stolen bank money.
Ben P. Tabor, one of Weber's coun
sel, is in San Francisco, and it is un
derstood he has secured the service of
Hiram W. Johnson for the defense.
Attorney Samuel J. Pullen has with
drawn from the defense of Weber. He '
will, however, look after the Weber i
estate for John Adams, guardian of
the accused youth. The contest for
control of the estate comes up next
Monday, when Adams will seek let- ,
ters of administration, opposing Pub- j
lie Administrator Shepard. who was
appointed special administrator by j
the court. >

"Say," he cried, "you nave get me
wrong. I never shot that man. I never
carried a gun in my life."
Felton was later arraigned in the Po
lice, Court and held without bail for
examination next Sunday. Should
Roche die before Sunday the prisoner
will be taken immediately before a
magistrate and remar.cec to the Coro
ner.
The police believe that the trouble
between Roche and Felton, which cul
minated in the shooting, arose over
a woman, who had transferred her af
fections from Roche to Felton.
The officers tried to put Felton
through a third degree inquisition. Sud
denly in the midst of it Felton broke
his silence:
To-day Roche, after the physicians
had told him that he had practically
no chance for recovery, consented to
have Felton brought before him and
said that he would idenriry him as the
man who fired the shot. When the
prisoner was brought to the wounded
man's bedside Riche said:
"Yes," Frank shot me, but he was
justified. I would have done the same
to him."
Roche later told the Coroner he had
told Felton that he was going: to shoot
him and walked away to get a gun.
He returned In a few minutes and as
he approached Felton he put his hand
to his hip pocket to draw the weapon
he says he had secured. At this move
ment, Roche told the coroner, Felton
drew his revolver and flred two shots
at him.
NEW YORK, Nov. 25.â Guy Roche,
the gambler, who was shot last evening
on Broadway near Thirty-fifth street
while the sidewalks were crowded with
persons leaving the theaters after the
matinees, is still alive. It was said at
the New York hospital that he might
live some time, but that there is small
chance of his recovery.
The arrest of Stewart A. Feltc-n,
known also by several other names,
charged with the shooting, was one of
the quickest cases of the kind ever
managed by the police. In one pocket
of Felton's clothes was a roll of 52900
in bills of large denomination. The
prisoner showed absolutely no concern
over- his arrest. Police Captain Cot
trell declared Felton to- be one of the
worst men he ever had to deal with in
the precinct, and that Roche was equal
ly bad.
Twice within the last three months
Felton has been a prisoner, each time
for assaulting a woman, once with a
cane. While the police thought this
woman might have been the cause of
the shooting, they say there was an old
feud between the gamblers and that
Felton had been pursued several times
to various cities by Roche, who had
threatened his life, and that Felton
finally had him arrested. Later the
men became reconciled and were walk
ing along Broadway w:tTi a .third man,
who escaped in a cab, when the shoot
ing 1 took place. Â¦

The Weber Piano costs a lot of j
money, but it's worth a lot of money.
There are piaros scrld every day on 'Â¦

BERKELEY, Nov. 25. â Plans for
the big seaside biological laboratory,
which the citizens of San Diego are
to erect at La Jolla, have been com
pleted by John Galen Howard, super
vising architect of the university, and
by him forwarded for approval to the
Southern California Association that
has undertaken the work. Actual
building will be commenced as soon
as the plans are approved.
The building is to cost about $30,
000 if brick and cement covering is
used, this being the architect's choice
of materials. Care has been taken In
drawing the plans to make the struc
ture complete and suitable for the
long series of tasks ahead of those
who intend to use the building in re
search work. *
. On* the basement floor are storage,
pickle and boat rooms. The storage
rooms will probably be used', as a

will be exhibited.
Individual research laboratories will
be on the second floor, with separate
rooms for each student. If necessary
two persons can be put in each of the
fifteen rooms.

Before a fashionable gallery the
Whites defeated the Reds in the first
of a series of polo games yesterday at
the Burlingame Country Club's
grounds. The field was in fine condi
tion and a more perfect day could not
be had for such sport. The score was
6 to 4. The game was one of the fast
est played on this field. It consisted
of six ten-minute periods and from
beginning to end was full of dash and
brilliant plays. The players opened
the game up with unusual vim. Both
sides worked hard for a goal in the
opening period, but the end came
without a score being tallied.
The second period had hardly begun
when the Reds, through a series of
clever strokes, scored a goal. This
had the effect of making the Whites
play harder and before the period
ended Cyril Tobin, with the assistance
of his team mates, scored two goals.
Charley Dunphy did some especially
fine work in riding off Tobin, a de
partment of the game in which he has
no superiors.
The Whites increased their lead in
the succeeding rounds until the sixth,
when the Reds were within a point
of tying the score. They appeared
the stronger, but the Whites pulled
themselves together in the last five
minutes of play and worked the ball
up the field, when Dunphy drove a
placed ball through the goal for the
final tally. *
Thomas A. Driscoll of the Whites
played a brilliant game, his ability in
taking the ball and nursing it down
the field being a clever exhibition. He
succeeded in scoring two goals for his
side. Following was the makeup of
the teams:
Whites â J. Lawson, C. Dunphy, C.
Tobin, T. A. Driscoll.
Reds â L. McCreery, R. M. Tobin,

NEW SOCIAL FAD
By Zoe Green Radcliffe.
A second effort to enlist the aid of
the courts to help him force the Board
of Education of this city to allow his
children to attend the public schools
of the city without heing vaccinated
was made to-day by C E. Kinard and
failed, Superior Judge Melvin sustain
ing a demurrer to the complaint with
out leave to amend. Kinard has gone
to the front on behalf of a number of
the citizens who are jiot in favor of
vaccination in an endeavor to break
down the rule regarding the compul
sory vaccination of children.
In his second complaint he asserted
that his children were being discrim
inated against and that other children
were admitted who had never been
vaccinated: also that the virus was
more dangerous than the disease. As
to the first allegation, it was held that
because the Board of Education failed
to do ita duty in one instance he could
not use it as a plea for further negli
gence. As to the second objection.
Judge Melvfn held that the quality of
the virus was not the question before
the court and he had nothing to do
\rith it

possible to encourage them to take a
greater interest in questions involving
ethical problems.

Mrs. Taussig was 42 years old and re
sided with her family at 2584 Vallejo
street. She laves two children,- Eric and
Laurence Taussig. She was the daugh
ter of Mrs. Sophie Henicke. ; .
Mrs. Rudolph J. Taussig, wife of the
well-known wholesale liquor merchant,
was stricken with exhaustion while
playing tennis in the Golden Gate Park
courts yesterday afternoon, and died a
few hours later at the Park Emergency
Hospital. Every possible medical means
was resorted to to save the woman's
life, but the efforts of the physicians
were In vain. The doctors pronounced
her case heart failure.
Captain Usher, speaking for the bu
reau of navigation of the navy, said
that the Navy Department was not
disposed to suggest any plan which
looked to the encouragement of the
merchant marine through subsidies for
speed, mileage or mail-carrying ves
sels, but was disposed to favor naval
premiums on ships to be built and
which fulfilled certain naval require
ments. P" .-;â¢;
Eugene Chamberlain, commissioner
of navigation. Treasury Department,
submitted a series of tables bearing
on tho commerce of the world. From
these he showed that the exports of
the United States largely exceeded the
imports, and said that imposition
of discriminating duties would be like
ly to result disastrously to the trade
of this country through retaliatory ac
tion by the countries affected.
Replying to Senator Gallinger,
Chamberlain said he favored the
granting of subsidies as a means/' of
national, defense.
j The commission went into executive
session. .No further witnesses will be
heard.
Hear Admiral Harrington favored
the building of steel ships, and said
that the laws of the United States
should be changed so as to permit the
merchants of this country to run
American ships as cheaply as foreign
owners can run them.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 55.â The Mer
chant Marine Commission resumed its
session to-day. Senator Gallinger, the
chairman, announced that the hear
ings were about concluded, but that
the commission had thought it proper
at this time to invite naval and Post
office Department officials to be pres
ent to-day, the former to submit their
opinion of the desirability of a mer
chant marine as auxiliary to the navy
and the latter to speak for the benefits
to accrue to the postal service as a
result of an improved merchant ma
rine. Secretary Metcalf of the Depart
ment of Commerce and Labor also was
invited to attend the hearing.
Secretary Morton's view of the rela
tion of the Government to the mer
chant marine in the foreign trade was
that it was simply a question of com
petition. He said that in order to build
up a large shipping interest in this
country it will be necessary to meet
the competition of other nations. It
will further be necessary,, he declared,
to in some way recognize the mail con
tracts v the subsidies, the' bonuses- and
the premiums of Germany, England
and other coxintries. The American
owner of sea"- going craft and the
American sailor, he said, must be given
equality In all respects if they are not
to be handicapped by foreign compe
tition. It was his idea that all ships
built in this country should be con
structed in accordance with plans ap
proved by the Navy Department, so
that in case of war the department
could make good and efficient use of
them. He added that he was not sure
but that the seamen also should have
naval training.
Rear Admiral Luce read a letter re
tontly submitted to him by Secretary
Morton to be laid before the commis
sion, in which he referred to the mu
tual independence of the merchant ma
rine and the navy. He asserted that
the money paid to foreign carriers of
products of this country went to enrich
countries with which the United States
might some day be at war, thereby in
directly aiding the navies of those
countries and their naval reserves at
the expense of our own. He favored
subsidies as a means of building up the
merchant marine.

The beautiful surroundings of the
University of California are to be ad
ded to by the planting of forests of
redwood, firs, madrones and oak3 on
the hills back of the group of State
University buildings. Arthur L. Bol
ton, superintendent of the university
grounds has | evolved the scheme,
which already is being carried out,
and which eventually will change the
entire character of the landscape east
of the college campus.
John Galen Howard, architect of
the university, has directed the plant
ing of hundreds of trees on the hills,
and all the work will be in conformity
with his suggestions.
The first work done was the plant
ing of hundreds of trees in the pro
tected hollows and sunny slopes of the
hills beyond the Greek Theater and
behind the present line of the
eucalyptus trees.
It is intended that the young trees
which have been set out shall grow
Into a forest, with natural exposures,
just as grow the redwoods that cover
many of the hills and mountains of
the coast ranges.
The seedlings and cuttings used in
this scheme of beautification of the
site of the "Greater University," now
considered by many the grandest in
the world, are the gift of Regent A.
"\\\ Foster and the Northwestern Lum
ber Company. They were brought
from the forests of Mendocino County
by Superintendent Bolton and F. Hein,
nursery foreman at the university,
who spent several weeks in the red
woods gathering them.
At President Wheeler's suggestion a
grove of redwoods and flrs has also
been planted at the south, or Bancroft
street, end of the new football field on
the Hillegass tract.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Nov. 25.,.
Jorgensen has started a small busi
ness and it is his intention to remain
in this city, as he still hopes that his
wife will change her mind and set him
free.
Stung by the disgrace which he has
heaped upon her, his wife has refused
to apply for a decree of divorce, and
so, although he has kept his promise to
return. Jorgensen cannot marry the
woman for whom he left his wife.
When Jorgensen came to the United
States a year and a half ago he left
his wife in Denmark, but brought with
him his two children, who when he was
taken back were returned to their
mother, who still lives in the old coun
try. Jorgensen expected that when he
was convicted of his crime his wife
would secure a divorce, and when he
was delivered to the Danish Consul to
be sent back he promised to return at
the end of his imprisonment and marry
Miss Muller. with whom he was Hying
at the time of his arrest.
Faithful to the woman for whom he
became a criminal and true to a prom
ise made before he was taken to Den
mark to face the punishment' for his
crime, Julius Jorgensen, who was ar
rested while living on Isabella street, in
this city, a year ago for embezzlement
committed in his own country, has re
turned to Oakland after serving a year
in prison in Denmark. Miss Johanna
Muller, with whom Jorgensen eloped,
is now living in Alameda, and it was
to be near her that be returned here
as soon as his term expired.

OAKLAND, Nov. 25.â With a bullet
wound through his head, the body of a
white man who had been dead for a
long time was found this afternoon
hidden in the brush on the steep hill
side of Blair Park, ; 150 feet from, the
county road leading into Hays Can
yon. Children: picnicking at the park
made the find. They summoned Charles
Kruse, a Hays Canyon . nurseryman,
who notified the Coroner.
diet of the Coroner's jury to-night was
to the effect that death was caused by a
gunshot wound self-in
flicted. '
There did not seem to be any sug
gestion of murder, according to the
Coroner. The body was so badly decom
posed that identification would be al
most impossible. It appeared to be
that of a Caucasian, about 40 years
old, with sandy mustache and reddish
hair. The garments were a black di
agonal coat and vest, dark woolen
trousers, light overshirt and two red
flannel undershirts, almost new, work
ingman's shoes and a four-in-hand tie.
In the pockets were a pocket knife.
55 cents and some medicine tablets.
Owing to the condition or the body, the
Coroner was compelled to order Imme
diate interment.
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 BroaGway, Nov. 25.
That portion of their November sal
aries which was earned by former Ser
geant at Police Charles E. Clark and
Patrolmen C. W. Ha-xnerton, J. F.
Stahl and Lee E. Andrews before their
dismissal on charges of thievery, has
been held up by the Board of Police
aud Fire Commissioners. If the dis
graced patrolmen desire to collect the
$26 apiecv ;hey will be obliged to man
damus the board. The ccmmlssioners
this afternoon, after much debate,
unanimously adopted a resolution post
poning action indefinitely on these four
Â¦alary demands.
Commissioner F. C. Turner opened
with an objection, sayir.g:
I do not want to go on record as voting
to pay FilÂ»riÂ«5 af rnpn who have been dls
loyÂ«! lo their trust and have placed this board
in an unfortunate Â«r.d unhappy poeition. I
regret we did not think to fine theee men
the amount of the'r claims when we dismissed
them froTn t^<Â» force
The following dialogue then followed:
Mayor O!nÂ«>â I egr?e with Commissioner
Turner, b-Jt I cermet tet how we can reject
the dfir.ands. They are legal claims upon
the cit;\
President McKiroyâ In the absence of a crim
inal prosecution these men would have a legal
claim.
Comtnifffon^r Turner â Let them Â«ue the city.
1 do not believe in wreaking vengeance, but
thie Is a matter that appeals very stronsly
tÂ»> me. 1 should li'xc to .hold up this money
until the toods that -were stolen have been
retoraf-d to the merchant.*. It iÂ« a matter
tit ecnUment with me. While there may be
a lesral bar to rejecting the demands, the men.
<m mere! grounds, did not earn the money.
They were stealing <1ur-.ns this time.
President McEIroy. moved to withhold
approval of the warrants until the
goods had been returned, but after dis
cussion withdrew the motion. Turner
offered a resolution 10 reject the de
mands, but this was lost by the nega
tive votes of McEIroy and Mayor Ol
ney, both of whom explained that it
was not within the legal province of
thÂ« board to thus act. "*
"The city could not successfully de
fend a suit." said President McEIroy,
"and there would be costs to pay in ad
dition to the judgment."
'"I think the extra cost would be a
goad investment," urged Turner. "I
am in favor of making it as unpleasant
as possible for the men."
Mayor Olney and McEIroy both de
clared their full agreement on this
point with Turner. A motion to allow
the claims on the ground c-f the city's
liability was made by Mayor Olney,
but Turner voted "no" and President
McEIroy met the tie by declining to
vote. He solved the situation by offer
ing the resolution to lay over indefi
nitely.
'This means that these men must
mandamus the board if they want their
mc/ney." said President McEIroy after
the resolution was adopted.
"I would like to see some one man
damus the 'police to swear to com
plaints against the four," was Turner's
closing remark.
The names of Patrolmen Henderson,
Cex, Scanlan, Bock and Curtiss were
discussed as candidates to be sergeant.
The board, in the absence of Chief of
Police Hodgkins, postponed action. The
charges against Policeman Sill will be
taken up at a special meeting next
week.

Judge SIoss, in a written opinion,
yesterday declared that the Howard
Company had violated its contract
with the Kern River Oil Company by
not paying for oil at the times speci
fied and the oil company
was justified in repudiating the agree
ment. The contract was made in Jan
uary, 1902. whereby the Kern Com
pany was to deliver as much oil a3
needed at a fixed price, not exceeding
10,000 barrels a month. The oil was
to be paid for or! the 15th of each
month. The last delivery was- on De
cember 31, 1902, and It was not paid
for until March, 1903. In January,
1903. the Howard Company said it
could sell 50.000 to 75.000 barrels at
the rate of 10,000 barrels a month and
it called for the delivery of that
amount under the contract. The Kern
Company repudiated the contract and
the Howard Company sued,' with the
result noted. â¢ - :

NEW YORK, Nov. 25.â Dun's Week
ly Review of Trade ' to-morrow will
say: Retail and jobbing trade was re
tarded this week by unseasonably mild
weather and the interruption of an
other holiday, but as manufacturers
extend operations confidence is
strengthened by the receipt of larger
contracts for future delivery and many
inquiries that have promised to mature
in something more tangible. Postpon
ed orders of all kinds are being placed,
reports from every prominent indus
try are that idle mills are reopening
and the number of operatives gradual
ly increasing. Cotton spinning makes
the slowest progress, but the statistical
positions steadily improve as stocks of
Ercods diminish and the raw material
draws nearer the point at which the
mills can operate profitably.
Othor textile ' lines, footwear and
practically all branches of the iron and
steel industries are gaining strength.
Activity is noted in the movement of
freight, while railroad returns furnish
ed thus far show a gain of 6 per cent
over last year's gross earnings.
Foreign trade at this port for the
last week exceeds that of a year ago
by $2,432,364 in value of merchandise
exports and $l,f33,309 in imports.
Prices of wool are fully maintained
at recent advances. Eastern markets
ruling quiet because of timid offer
ings rather than any slackening of de
mand. Woolen mills are actively en
gaged, the only cause of complaint be
ing the price of raw material.
Failures this week number 205 in
the United States, against 25S last year,
and in Canada "9, compared with 14
a. year ago.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
Cold weather is needed to move retail
slocks of winter clothing, dry. goods
and shoes, reorders for which from job
bers are not brisk. On the other hand,
the trade in holiday goods has begun
well. Hftinufacturing industries are
active in most lines the country over.
Winter employment in the iron and
allied trades is assured and labor is
better employed than a year ago at
this date. Holding by farmers is cred
ited with affecting collections at sev
eral Southern points, but, as a whole,
payments are better than a year ago.
All the metals are strong, and cop
per, lead and tin show slight advances
on the week.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending November 24 num
ber 193, against 190 last week, 167 last
year and 1S2 in jIÂ»02. In Canada failures
for the week numbered 31, as against
64 last week and 13 in this week a
year ago.
Wheat (including flour) exports for
the week ending November 24, aggre
gate 1,332,36â¬ bushels, against 1,289,642
last week and 2.S51.767 last year. From
July 1 to date the exports aggregate
2fc,010.447 bushels, against 68,282,7&5 last
year.

The Pacific Mail Company's big liner
Kcrea. Captain Seabury in command,
arrived yesterday from the Orient. She
brought 527 passengers and 6334 tons of
cargo. For the first time in her career
l*ie Korea on the voyage just ended
found the ocean lough enough to shake
her big frame and give those aboard
;. taste of the tumbling with which ,
travelers on smaller vessels are fa- j
mfllar. AH the way from Yokohama to
Honolulu high peas contested the liner's '
way and fierce winds swept her broad
decks. Sh3 had to lie for ten hours
off Nagasaki waiting: for a pilot. She
arrived off the Japanese port after
dark, and as the harbor entrance is
elaborately mined for protection against
Russian visitors Captain Seabury could
not afford to take chances of losing his
ship. The Korea made a good run from
Honolulu, reaching; this port a few
hours before she was expected, and
3fter j>asÂ£:ng quarantine she was
l-rought alongside the Mail dock as
only â¢'BSli" Seabury can perform that
operation.
The Korea's passengers were divided
as fellows: Ninety-nine in the cabin,
seventy-four in the steerage and 354 in
the Asiatic steerage. Among the cabin
passengers were glove-trotters from
many lands, government officials and
business men. Two prisoners under sen
tence from the United StatPS consular
cuurt at Yokohama to terms at San
Quentin were brought here on the Ko
rea. Albert Marshall, who three years
ago, when he was steward on the
steamship Peru, tried to kill Captain
Pillebury, the commander of that ves
sel, returned on the Korea after having
served two years in a Hongkong pris
on. Marshall, who declined to discuss
his case, was sentenced to four years in
jail, but is said to have been pardoned
after serving half his sentence.

Another feature of interest will be "Jottings of Old Lim Jucklin,"
by Opie Read, in which the backwoods philosopher delivers himself
of considerable dry and pungent wit on "First Love." Charles
Dryden continues the adventures of his precocious youth, in "On
and Off the Bread Wagon," taking in a Polish wedding; Madge
Moore has a page on "The Practical Girl as a Money Saver"; Robert
W. Ritchie reviews current literature; Kate Thyson Marr contri
butes "The Ways of a Man With a Maid," and besides the usual
puzzle page there arc storiettes by Martha McCulloch Williams,
Lillian G. Paschal and Richard Shelton.
ii i-x OUBLE HARNESS," Anthony Hope's novel of London
I 1 society, runs through its second installment in The Sun-
* â day Call Magazine to-morrow. The story deals with
the experiences of a woman who, intensely idealistic and ex
pecting her ideals to be realized in her husband, Grantley Imason,
gradually comes to believe that she has made a mistake and that
her husband is too unimaginative and self-satisfied to understand
her. After their child comes the breach between them widens.
Only the plimpses she has of the quarrelings and bickerings between
married friends and acquaintances prevent her from an open rupture.
Then enters into her life Walter Blake, who, to her ardent nature,
seems to promise all that her husband has failed to realize. On
the very threshold of committing an irretrievable step she is recalled
to herself, in a sqene in which she, her husband and Walter Blake
figure, after the husband has overtaken them in their flight. This
scene, at a lonely wayside inn, is one of the most powerful por
trayals of character play upon character that Mr. Hope has ever
penned.
Another fiction feature of lively interest is "The Clutch of
Talons," the second $50 prize story in The Sunday Call's weekly
contest. Mr. M. R. Daniels, a senior at the University of Cali
fornia, is the author and the story is unusually strong and well sus
tained for a young writer. To-morrow will appear also the second
in the series of free piano lessons instituted last Sunday. These
chart lessons on chords are the invention of W. Scott Grove, a New
York music teacher of a lifelong experience. They have proven
universally popular in the East and have been generally recom
mended as a practical and simple short cut to skill upon the piano
forte.

two seats from the end, staring at an
open letter with eyes widened in des
pair, horror and desperation.
Thi3 train made few stops, but at
the first station, in obedience to a sig
nal from the bell cord, it slowed doyn
sufficiently for the conductor and
brakeman to thrust the man ffom the
second step of the Pullman; then it
shot ahead at full speed to make up
the few seconds lost. The tramp re
mained standing where he had drop
ped, his face now keen and alert, and
his right arm upraised. As it swept by
the train brushed his clothing and the
wind of it stirred his rough, unkept
hair and beard. Three cars passed,
then came the observation car. Sud
denly his hand closed like a vise upon
the rear railing, his body swung out
and writhed for a few moments In mid
air, then his feet caught and he drew
himself in by sheer rorce of muscle
and nerve to the same crouching po
sition he had occupied on the Pullman,
forward.
Inside the car the other man wai
now tearing the letter into the most
minute fragments, as if striving to
annihilate Its contents. When the
pieces were too small for further re
duction they swept through the open
window and were scattered thinly over
half a mile of the roadbed. The man
rose and glanced about the car. It was
almost empty and the other passen
gers were buried in papers or books.
Ho turned back quickly, opened the
door and with a light spring threw
himself from the train, but not to the
ground! Just as he sprang the tramp
flung himself out suddenly, with noth
ing but his left hand grasping the rail.
As the two bodies came together the
tramp's right arm closed like a steel
band around the other, while the
weight of it bore them down, down
until their legs almost swept the mock
ing rails of the roadbed!
Not many men â not one In a thou
handâcould have sustained such a
weight in such a position, swinging
from side to side under the motion
of a train going at fifty miles an hour;
but gradually, little by little, the left
arm. contracted and drew them up, up
and In, until finally, with a last des
perate effort they were both crouching
upon the rear platform, white, gasping,
too exhausted to stand or speak.
The well dressed man recovered first.
The horror was still In"- his eyes, but
with it was something more. Perhaps
that instant In midair, with death In
front, had made him see more clear
ly; perhaps his miraculous rescue had
made possible the greater rescue from
himself. As he rose staggeringly, the
tramp's arm went out In feeble pro-
Beautiful hands! O beautiful hands!
Could reach out of the alien lands
Where you are lingering, and give me

Only a touch â were it ever bo light â
My heart were soothed, and my weary

Would lull Itself into rest again;
For there is no solace the world corn

\l\/ ited drew out from Jackson-
V V ville, north bound, there were
two young men on board un
der widely different circumstances, j
One was crouching upon the sec- j
ond step of a Pullman, forward,
with his eyes fixed grimly upon
the door through which the con
ductor would pass on his round of tick- j
et collecting. The other was In the
observation car at the rear of the train.
"I say you are not," she interrupt
ed, emphatically. "Maybe It was un
businesslike and maybe you are legal
ly responsibleâ I do not know about
that. But I do know you are no more
guilty than I am in the way the paper
puts It. Of course, you will let every
cent of your property go toward pay
ing these poor people, and if it isn't
enough we will pay the rest, off Just
as fast as we can earn It."
"Helen! Helen!" he remonstrated
sharply, "you must not talk like that
You do not understand. We cannot
be married now. Why, dear, I may be
arrested."
"All the more need you will have
for my help then," she replied quick
ly. "If I am to be a helpmeet there
will never be more occasion for it than
now. We will be married Just as goon
as we reach Washington, Just as we
planned, and then we will work to
gether to live this thing down. Why,
Robert!" !
For the young man's head had sud
denly dropped to the back of the seat,
and his shoulders were heaving con
vulsively. She sank to the seat be
side him, slipped one of her hands into
his, stroking it softly until he should
regain control of himself.
And miles behind them on the track
sat a tramp waiting for the next
freight. (Copyright, 1904, by Frank
H. Sweet)
"But don't you see it's Just the same,
Helen?" he said gently. "The money
was Intrusted to me and I am the sole
one responsible. If I neglected the
trust and allowed my partner an op
portunity to do tha rest I am really
the one to blame."
"Robert, what does tMs awful thing
about you mean?" she .exclaimed. "I
suppose you have seen the paper?"
He was holding to the back of the
seat for support, his face drawn and
haggard.
"No, you needn't show it to me.
Helen," he answered. "I have not
seen the paper, but I know what It
contains. It is true. I only discov
ered it myself a ehort time ago. I
was given my mall as we left the
hotel and slipped It into my pocket.
I did not read It until I left you and
your mother and came back to the
observation car Just now. It was all
In a letter from my partner."
The girl loolced at him, her lips
trembling; but she smiled. "I know
it is not true, Robert," she declared
positively; "not a word of it. I have
known you ever since we went to
school together, and you are utterly
Incapable of a thing like that. You
have not read the paper, so you do
not understand. Why, Robert"â her
voice quivered with Indignation â "the
paper says you stole half a million
dollars, and from poor people â most
ly people whose means of support It
was. It's absurd. You have been with
us the last three montns and this has
all happened within that time."
Five minutes later thet young man
was back in the car, two seats from
the end, still dazed and white. Sud
denly the door at the forward end
opened and a girl entered, holding a
paper in her hand. She came straight
to him.

"No need of that now, my friend,"
the still white lips whispered- "I am

never attempt anything like that
again."
The train beeran to slacken and at
that moment the door opened and the
conductor came out. They were pass
ing over a shiort piece of road where
repairs were being ma<le, and slow
speed was necessary. The conductor
nodded to hia passenger, but seemed
surprised at his disheveled appearance.
Then his gaze fefll upon the tramp and
his face darkened.
"You here!" he exclaimed; "and after
being put off onae, too.' And from the

There was a sudiden jerk, which in
timated that the train was about to
increase Its speed. The conductor
caught the tramp by the shoulder, and
with a quick twist sent him from the
train. The passenger uttered ttn angry
cry of remonstrance and tried to stay
the act, but too late. As the train
gathered headway they saw the tramp
go plunging and staggering down a
steep embankment, at the bottom of
which he righted himself and waved
his hand cheerfully at the receding
train.
BY FRflNK H. SWEET.
AT the mianlcsgjving dinner of the American colony in London
Sir Edward Clark took occasion to object to the people of
the United States adopting'for themselves the name "Ameri
can*" and calling their country "America."' The subject has been
discussed before.
Many years a^o, at a Fourth of July celebration by Americans
and foreign guests in Geneva, an eminent Frenchman made the
same criticism, and proceeded to an elaborate analysis of the origin
and construction of national names. He proceeded frorn this
analysis to derive for a citizen of this republic the name "United
Statesman." When this is examined, it is seen to lack entirely the
quality r,f distinctness and exclusive application. We have in this
hemisphere the united states of Mexico and the united states of
Brazil. On the isthmus, since Bolivar's day, there has been cher
ished a dream of the united states of Central America. So, seen
from the outside the bare term united states would require explana
tion.
The Frenchman found his analogy in the name of France and
French. Both terms are understood and are limited. Our name,
the United States of America, is older than the constitution. In the
articles of confederation adopted in 1777, confederating the original
thirteen separate colonies, article I said: "The style of this Con
federacy shall be the United States of America/' This was followed
in the preamble to the constitution of 1789, in which the convention
wrote that we "do ordain and establish this constitution for the
United States of America."
It will be observed that the article "the" serves other than its
merely grammatical purpose. It mearfe that there may be other
united states, but this is "the" united states. At the time it was
adopted this was the only United States of America. It is, there
fore, the senior and its juniors have only copied its style. We have,
it will be seen, the prior right to call ourselves Americans. When
we adopted the name all the rest of the hemisphere was in a colonial
condition. The Canadas were English, the rest of the hemisphere
was mainly divided between Spain and Portugal and the people
were Spaniards and Portuguese. We were the only Americans,
adopting the name of the continent as our name. When the revolu
tion began we called ourselves "Continentals," because we wished
to be differentiated from the peoples who owed a foreign allegiance
beyond the continent. The transition to "American" was perfectly
natural and in accordance with the principle governing selection of
style and title. So we were the first Americans and have become
the greatest, and will remain to the end the greatest Americans,
measured by our personal characteristics and our national power.
Our style and title are well understood by the whole world.
Sir Edward Clark's criticism was called out by an evolution of our
style, required by brevity and dictated by the rule of exact descrip
tion and designation. In view of the existence of other united
states, junior to us, in this hemisphere, our Government has dropped
"United States" as the designation of our foreign embassies, and
our diplomatic representative is now called briefly and descriptively,
"the American Embassador." The title is simple and dignified, and
belongs to us by prescriptive right.
Other nations adopt their names and bear them for reasons
sufficient unto themselves. For a long time after the fall of Calais
broke poor Mary's heart the English sovereigns styled themselves
"King of Great Britain, France and Ireland." In our first treaty
with Sweden the sovereign called himself "the King of Sweden, of
the Goths and Vandals." So also we have had treaties with "His
most Catholic Majesty" and "His most Christian Majesty." These
sovereigns chose the name that seemed best to express their power
or their pretensions. The people of this country are also sovereign,
and have the same right to choose the national name by which
they will be known. Our fathers called themselves Americans and
this America, and the union they formed became logically the United
States of America. These styles will endure. Sir Edward Clark
proposed to rcchristen us "Unona." But Mr. Choate, American Em
bassador, simply and with dignity dismissed the subject by saying
that "we are quite satisfied with our name."

are leaving town to-day to attend the
closing festivity of the week.
Joseph R. Knowland of Alameda
leaves to-day for Washington, where
he will soon enter upon hi3 Congres
sional duties. En route he will visit his
sister, Mrs. Saidee Knowland Coe of
Chicago, one of the cleverest pianists
and interpreters of Wagner in Amer
ica- Mrs. Knowland will not accom
pany her husband, but may follow later
to enjoy the social life of the capital
when in the height of Its glory.
There will be a radiant gathering of
the debutantes, notably Miss Mai3ie
Langhorne, Mis3 Anita Harvey and
Miss Alyce Sullivan, and a splendid
coterie of debutantes of older growth.
The patronesses are lira. Alfred Hun
ter Voorhies, Mrs. Malcolm Henry, Mrs.
Thomas Porter Bishop, Miss Maria
Voorhies, Mrs. James Potter Langhorne.
Mrs. Eleanor Martin, Mrs. Bowman H.
McCaila, Mrs. William A. McKittrick,
Mrs. William F. Herrin, Mrs. Francis J.
Sullivan and Mrs. John D. Spreckela.
And, by the way. the fiat haa gone
forth that there shall be a dearth of
dinners before the dance, for the ob
vious and sane reason that a two
hours' session at table doesn't conduce
to a crisp, chic air.
Then down with, the dinners that pre
cede formal dances. They muss one
shockingly, and smudge one's noaka-up
so. HencÂ« the dictum. .And. besides,
it wearies the maidens fair till they look
like faded chrysanthemums. So, there!
But the Assembly on Monday promises
to be a vision fair and a living joyâ for
at least three happy, fleeting hours.
Since the decadence of the Foftnight
lies the Assemblies and the Greenway
dances are the only terpslchorean
"stunts" vouchsafed the smart set, and
herefor the Monday night ball is .fair
ly a-glltter with the gladness of gowns
and things. Fresh gowns? "Why. Ioad3
of them, for here at the very birth of
the season the debutante â blesa herâ
and her sisters aad her aunts are bud
ding forth in the crtsr>ness of new let
tuce. And what's fresher?
Monday begins the first of the famou3
Assembly dances at the Palace, &a of
yore.
In the afternoon there will be further
social intercourse and at 3 o'clock Ben
Greet will make an address.
The meetings of this body of women
are almost foremost in the city resnrd

POPULAR AUSTRALIAN SINGER

Attorneys Dibble and Vogelsang in
dicated plainly thaf they did not be
lieve the testimony of Low Doon and
announced that they would bring evi
dence in rebuttal, Including statements
he is said to have made to other
Chinese, and the custom-house records.
Lum Quoia, the alleged local widow
and responsible for Cunningham's ap
pointment, was also on the stand. She
told the story of her wooing and mar
riage in a moat direct fashion. Sum
marized as interpreted, she said:
"Chew Bing Quoia told my father he
wanted to marry me. My father told
him that he would speak to me about
it. Then Chew Bing Quoia said to
me, I have asked your father if I can
marry you? will you marry me."
"And what did you say?" queried
Attorney Hill.
Smilingly the "widow" replied: "I
said I like you if you like me. And
we were married. I was taken to his
house in a hack." She has lived there
ever since, as the attorneys for the pe
titioner admitted, to shorten the
examination. . . - , . â¢. .
It is apparent that somebody is
stretching the truth in the Chew Blng
Quoia case and the decision upon the
petition for the removal of J. J. Cun
ningham as administrator of the dead
Chinaman's estate Will depend upon
which Oriental witness is be
lieved. Several reputed sons and
nephews of the departed labor con
tractor testified recently that he had
married a woman named Low Shee in
China. Some of them described the
wedding ceremony, which they said
they had attended, in minute detail.
The marriage document was produced
in evidence and high Chinese dignita
ries were called to tell of the laws that
bind in the Flowery Kingdom.
Yesterday in Judge Coffey's court
the Cunningham side gave a blow to
all of this evidence. It placed one
Low Doon on the stand. He said he
was the brother of Low Shee and he
indentifled her photograph, which had
been put in evidence b,y the other side.
He declared that when he left China
she was living with her mother and
ten years later was still in the family
abode. She had never been married,
he said. Doon has been working in
the Alaska canneries for twenty-one
years and for five years he worked
for Chew Bing Quoia. He says that
Quoia lived with Ng Shee, one of his
"wives" in Portland, but that N'g
Shee had no children then. This is
another contradiction because the pe
titioner for Cunningham's removal is
Chew Lum, who claims to be the son
of Ng Shee and Chew Bing Quoia and
who supports the contention of Low
Shee in China. Doon said he did not
know Chew Lum.
After the matter had been generally
discussed it was unanimously decided
to call a mass-meeting at Temple
Emanu-El on Monday evening, Decem
ber 5. Governor Pardee will be request
ed to preside. Those who will be in
vited to speak are Judge Morrow, Pres
ident Wheeler, President Jordan, Arch

An Old Couple's Troubles.
There is an old ccraple of Hillsdale,
Kansas, the husband 71 and the wife
67, who made a discovery le.te In life
that would have saved lots of their
troubles, something they learned about
Ciet
Th* old gentleman says: "One day
the doctor told me my wife's trouble
was not heart disease but her stomach,
but she thought he was mistaken. As
I had read several statements In the
papers about Postum Food Coffe* my
rsind was soon made up, and it was
in the fall of 1901 that I got a pack-
age of Postum, asking my wife to try
it.
"She said she did not believe it would 1
help her. and so it was laid aside and !
ehe suffered ail the winter, drinking I
coffee all the time until about the first
of May, when she was In terrible dis-
tress.
"One night about our bed time she
eaid she must have the doctor, but be-
fore you go fix a little Postum and I
â¢fta try it-
"So I prepared half a pint of Postum |
according to directions, and as soon as '
ehe had drank it she felt warm and
nourished all over and in a little while
her pain was jrone, it was like magic. ;
For a fevr meals she used a little cof-
fee and th<?n a wrangling began In her
stomach each time, so finally she gave
up coffee altogether and used Postum
only. Better and better she got and
prew stronger and finally all the old
disease left.
"Since that time we have used noth-
ing but Postum, nor have we had any
occasion to call for the doctor since,
and I now advocate Postum to every-
one I meet." Name given by Postum
Company. Battle Creek, Mich.
Bo many people say, "Coffee don't
hurt." and then tell you they "know
a man 70 years old who has drank it
all hla life." That doesn't prove that
you can drink it. "One man's meat Is
another's poison." If coffee agrees and
the Crtnker keeps wolL stick to it, but
I^f any kind of ails or disease show,
better heed the warning and quit cof-

The race with all its faults has been
one. of the most exciting In the history
of baseball in any league. During the
first half, Oakland, Tacoma, Los An
geles and Seattle were all bunched at
the top of the' ladder and only a few
points separated the four of them.
The Tigers . then showed their true
colors, while the , Commuters slumped
and displayed the yellow streak. The
Angels never fought hard enough to
figure, while Seattle lost ; through
overconfidence and hard, luck at "the
last moment
San Francisco, as usual, proved a
tramp team â a' team that did not
even get the sympathy of the home
crowds. Away from home, the Seals
could not - win a Â¦ sÂ«ries. When the
fans did get warmed up and expected
something, the Harris aggregation al
ways fell 'down.' At that, ' they have
played great: ball "during :-. the 'last
month and are about certain ' of -i beat-
From a financial standpoint, the de
cisive victory of the Tigers in the
second half is a disastrous thing. Just
Imagine the crowds that Oakland and
Tacoma would draw in this city In a
pest-season contest The manage
ment loses thousands of dollars and
the public misses the chance of seeing
a royal contest between two evenly
matched ball teams. But the for
tunes of the national. sport have been
shared by the Tigers alone, and they
managed to triumph while their op
ponents were found wanting. !;}-Â¦'-
The victory of the Tacoma aggre-,
gation is an Illustration of what a
well organized ball team can do. It
also demonstrates what a heady leader
like Charles Graham is capable of ac
complishing with a team that was far
from being a stellar aggregation on
paper. The Tigers were trained to be
gome and to fight They lived, up to
this tutoring in all but two series with
Oakland. After showing the yellow
streak for a while, they rallied once
again and came back fighting till
they jumped Into the lead once more
and galloped in lengths ahead of the
field.
1004 is about to pass into history and
the pennant is ready to be delivered to
Mike Fisher, king of the Tigers and
the gamest manager of the lot. A
week ago any one would bet that Ta
coma would not annex the flag with
out at least going through the for
mality of indulging in a post-season
series of games with either Los An
geles or Oakland. But the Tigers
showed they are there at the critical
moment, while the Angels and Com
muters fell down when the final test
was at hand.
The men who have blinds on the
marsh near San Mateo and who are
putting out bait are getting excellent
shooting. Blue bills were unusually
numerous last week and big strings
were secured.
Conditions generally seem unfavor
able for quail shooting, but small re
turns being reported. Fred King,
who is an expert 00 these birds, killed
but three in a day's shoot recently.
Twelve of the Empire Gun Club
men were on their extensive Monterey
preserve last Sunday. Birds were
plentiful and a good shoot was en
joyed. A larger attendance is expect
ed to-morrow, as a number of mem
bers will be accompanied by guests.

Tcm Casey stumbled upon a bevy
of quail near Novato two weeks ago
which he estimates numbered <!00
birds. He secured seventeen and
counted on a limit bag a week later.
This time he saw few birds and killed
but six. Many empty she'ls told the
tale of the extermination of th-> beau

portions of the mar3he.s are fairiy
overrun with men in quest of a few
birds. These men are continually
moving from place to place and scare
all the birds away. More considera
tion for others would probably mean
better results for themselves.
The recent bright moonlight has not
been favorable for good shooting. The
birds come in during the night to feed
and are away again before daylight
A late fog hung over Collinsville
last Sunday and the birds did not

A handicap tournament over eighteen
holes, medal play, was held on the 1
links of the San Francisco Golf Club
on Thanksgiving day. The prize offered
for the best gross score was won by
Dr. J. R. Clark with 83. The course,
in spite of ths rough treatment it re
ceived from. the soldiers, is in fair con
dition. The eight players who made
the best scores, after deduction of the
handicaps, qualified for the handicap
competition over eighteen holes, match
play. Those who" qualified and their net
scores were: Dr. J. R. Clark. G. E.
Starr, Rolla'V. Watt and R. I. Bentley,
82 each; Worthington Ames, 83; L. F.
Monteagle, 84, and R. G. Hanford, 85.

standstill in Oakland during the present
year, bids fair to revive with the open
ing of the Claremont Country Club,
which will take place on Saturday, De
cember 3. During the day there will be
a golf tournament, competitions in
lawn tennis and Scotch bowling and a
trap-shooting contest. In the afternoon
there will be music and refreshments in
the clubhouse.
The road leading to the club grounds
will be completed during the coming
week. Visitors . from San Francisco
should travel by the Key Route, taking
the Piedmont line and getting off the
cars at the last station. Cars will con
vey them thence to the club.
The first nine holes of the new course
are ready for play, and work is being
done on the second nine. The course
for the first nine holes requires straight
and accurate driving, for a ball which
falls outside of it will be as good as
lost. The remaining nine holes are laid
out on open land, affording unlimited
scope. George Smith, the resident pro
fessional of the old Oakland Golf Club,
says the new course when the eighteen
holes are completed will be superior to
any. links in California.
Excellent judgment was used by
the tournament committee of the Cal
ifornia Club in allotting the handicaps
on Thursday. In events of this kind
as a rule only the best players sur
vive the first day's play. Of the nine
men left four are on the "owe -15"
mark, one scratch, one "15," two
"15 3-6" and one "30 3-6."
The only match left in the second
round is that between Harry Rolfe
and Sherwood Adams. They will
meet on even terms and it is a toss-up
between them. Rolfe is a steady
player, but Adams . is â¢ probably a
higher class man, somewhat out of
practice. The winner will be called
upon to "owe 15" and give "30 3-6" to
M. Little. These are tremendous odds,
but it is. thought either one can dis
pose of the limit, man.
A good match will result when
George Janes and Melville Long come
together. Janes defeated Herbert
Long on Thursday and it is safe to say
the younger Long will do his best to
lower Janes' colors. Janes will allow.
Long owe odds of 15. Long is consid
ered by many to be almost as clever
as his opponent and with his handicap
his chances look good. ' v : ; f - ' ,:'' ."-i
, The last match in the third round
will.be between Will Collier and
George Cutler. ; The handicapper
probably underrated Cutler. * and he
will make trouble for his opponents.
The match between Long and Janes
was a hard fought affair and i shows
how. evenly matched are these clever
young players. As a rule Long beats
Janes in. practice, but the latter plays
a steadier tournament game.
The mixed doubles event proved un
usually interesting and was produc
tive of some good tennis, Miss An
nabel Vodden and Charles Foley
(owe 3-6) will play Miss Ethel Rat
cliffe and Charles Dunlap (owe
15 3-6) in the semi-finals. It Is ex
pected Miss Ratcliffe and Dunlap will
win this match, although their op
ponents are two clever young play
ers.
In the second round one match re
mains to be played. Major Van Vleit
and his daughter. Miss- Sarita, play
ing from scratch, will be opposed to
R. C. Noble and Miss Mary Ratcliffe,
who are "15 3-6" behind scratch.
George Baker and Miss Vera Crocker
(owe 3-6) will play the winner of
this match in the semi-finals. All
matches, including finals, will consist
of two sets out of three.
events were started on Thursday and

There will be but one day's coursing
at Ingleslde Park this week. The first
round of a reserve stake will be com:

Lucy Clair, will be decided. After' this
the champion stake will be run. The
likely winners:

A reserve stake of sixty-four entries
will make ud the card for 'Union
Coursing Park to-morrow. The grey
hounds are unusually well matched.
The likely winners:
After the s accused person -has had
an impartial trial it will be much
more difficult for him to be reinstated
than under the present conditions. The
new system has many advantages and
will undoubtedly be adopted.
The new idea is for the park man
agement to suspend any owner or
greyhound and to refer the case to
the coursing committee which will
consider Jt at its next meeting. After
hearing the testimony it can inflict
the punishment. This will relieve the
park management of much responsi
bility and also of the charge of preju
dice.
The California Coursing Committee,
the governing body of the sport of the
leash on this coast, has made a rec
ommendation to the managers of the
various coursing parks under its Juris
diction, which, If accepted, will change
the system of punishing , offenders
against the laws of coursing.
Under the present conditions the
park officials fix the penalty for any
violations of the rules. The person
thus punished then has the right of
appeal to the California Coursing
Committee.

FIVE HORSES FALL.
The sporting fraternity appears fully
convinced that ToUng Corbett is cap
able of making Battling Nelson stop
when they clash next Tuesday night at
Woodward's Pavilion. So confident are
the men who like to place a little bet
on pugilistic affairs, despite the Gans
vaudeville show, that they were willing
to lay 6 to 10 yesterday on the lad from
Denver. There was a lot of Corbett
money offered.
The betting practically opened yes
terday. A few small wagers have been
made from time to time during the last
week or so, but the general wagering
was inaugurated yesterday. With the
price 6 to 10 so early in the game, it
figures to drop at least a point ere the
hour of battle is at hand, and the wise
ones think 1 to 2 will eventually rule.
Battling Nelson descended from his
lofty perch last night and agreed to
meet Jimmy Britt for a percentage of
the gate money should he be successful
in stowing Corbett away. For some
time the Chicago mixer has been-pos
sessed of the idea that he is a prima
donna, and therefore demanded a guar
antee befitting that station. Now he
is willing to do battle with Britt for 60
per cent of the receipts.
Nelson agrees to meet Britt at 132
pounds at 6 o'clock on the evening of
their light. This goes, of course, if he
beats Corbett. He did not like the
weight at first, but was finally induced
to be a good fellow and sign by Match
maker Jim Coffroth of the Yosemite
Club. Nelson says he will be fit and
ready to give Britt an argument if Cor
bett does not interfere.
Corbett Is apparently all right now.
The good work in which he has in
dulged during the last few wekea has
begun to tell and the former champ is
beginning to look like the real kid once
more. He whiled away a few. Idle mo
ments yesterday by putting Frank
George out and sending Teddy Wolff a
to the carpet for a while.
After his usual promenade on the
highway the little man strutted Into the
gym looking: for some one to take a
punch at. George was handy and little
Willie went at him. The former began
td mix it ere the go was any too old.
and he got one of those Jolty ones that
kept him on the mat for a few mo
ments. Ted "Wolff e came up for 'his.
and he got It without waiting long. Thla
seemed to make the rest of the talent
shy and also served to make the Denver
kid feel good. He weighed 133 pounds
last night.
The sale of seats for the encounter
opened yesterday at Harry Corbett's. A
good house Is expected, as the public
If worked up to the fact that both box
ers are out to win. As they can each
hand out Quite an assortment of wal
lops there is every reason to expect a
spirited mix-up when they meet.
Now Mr. Coffroth is sure of a fight
no matter who wins the Corbett-Nelson
mix-up.. He also proposes to keep Jim
my Gardner^n reserve in case anything
goes wrong. Gardner is still quartered
In Denver waiting for Coffroth to give
him the offer to come out here. Coffroth
says he will beckon to the Lowell fist
artist In a hurry if the result of the
Corbett-Xelson mill does not meet with
the approval of the public.

against the score board. The Seals had
a good comeback -in their half of "-ithe

double to right, and finished as Hilde

The Seals forged ahead in .the next
period arid got twoâ just enough to win.
Meany started the racket with a single
over first. After Irwin and Waldron
went down Anderson got a wallop in
the slats. He promptly stole and ar
rived with Meany when Gochnauer lift
ed a dinky fly over Streib's head, just
far enough to be out of Julie's reach.
It was good for two bags, but Goch
nauer died- there, for there was no one
good enough to bring him home.
Buchanan's single and Dunleavy's
second two-base "swipe netted the Com
muters one more during the fifth spasm.
Dunleavy opened up the seventh with
a single and started to steal. He was
nearly to second when Schlafiey popped
up a short fly to Anderson. Dun was
doubled up and a good chance was thus
spoiled. The score:

t ;*_ When one pall team starts to ride
fast ,."on .the -toboggan and another! in
augurates a winning spirit there Js no
telling what will come off. Just now
Sari Francisco and Oakland are playing
that little" game, and yesterday f the
Seals had the extreme pleasure of lord
ing it over those_j3ossible champs at
Recreation Park "for the ,Â¦ fifth time
without a break. Scoreâ San Francisco
3, Oakland 2.
Oakland played good baseball, but
not good enough to beat the Seals. The
game was a brisk one arid looked as
though it might be broken up at any
old moment. Mr. Gochnauer, the gen
tleman who has found hitting the ball
a tedious .task during the last few
months, was once more the sticking kid,
bringing in the two. that beat the Com
muters, i
of clean batting enlivened .the
game in nearly ever inning. The Seals
played faultless ball in the field, and
were on the I alert when they reached
the sacks. Dunleavy pounded out four
bitsâ ttvo doubles and two singlesâ out
of four trips to the plate. All the runs
were annexed : after two had ' been
chased to the bench.
Just a vestige of his former great self,
Vesuvian, from the Jennings stable,
took the six and a half furlong handi
cap yesterday at Oakland. He came
out of the race in a rickety condition,
and It may be some time before he
will face the barrier again. The half
brother to Geyser carried 111 pounds
And had a decided call in the betting
over the other six starters. W. Davis
pot him away a length in advance of
his field, but appeared content to wait. |
He permitted Venator and Albula to
make the running. Entering the stretch
Venator had enough ana after consid
erable urging the favorite passed and
defeated Albula by half a length. Roy
al Rogue and Kenilworth were never
factors.
Davia also rode two other winners
tnd now gives promise of making good
with a vengeance. He Is a quite un
assuming little fellow, displays rare
coolness In a race and is bound to
become popular with turf goers.
FIVE CHOICES ARE BEATEX.
Even though the racing was inter
esting things seemed quiet after the
big throng of the day before. Five
choices took the count and the book
makers must have swept up a little
flUft.
W". Davis began operations by plac
ing Dr. Sherman over the plate winner
cf the introductory sprint, for which
a f.eld of twelve went to the poet. The
Doctor closed second choice in the bet
ting and won easily from Troy, the
mount of Knapp. Tullctt finished third
on the outsider. Skip Me.
'Smiling Mickey" MeLaughlln astride
the 2 to 1 favorite, XuJian, managed to
get lost in the discard.
George Crosswaite appears to have
lost all form in the saddle, for he made
a sorry botch of piloting Bose Eley, the
11 to 10 choice for the two-year-old
â¢.vent. The Wernberg youngster had
shown well in morning trials, but in
the race didn't strike a gait fast enough
to beat a fat man. Helgesen had the
mount on James Nealon's Callaghan,
the second choice, which he landed a
clover first, after an early drive. Platt,
a 20 to 1 shot from the Stevens -stable,
came through at *th'e*~cl6se\*7do'wnlns
Cardinal Sartu a head for the place.
Bose Eley was never in better than
sixth position.
AUNT POLLY FAILS BACKERS.
Judging from her showing in the six
fuilonp selling affair Aunt Polly must
have dissipated on Thanksgiving day,
for she gave her backers an awful
shock. Chaperoned by McLaughlin and
a 4 to 5- choice, the mare couldn't shake
up speed enough to perspire. As it was
two 13 to 1 shots, Berendos and Doub
let, fought it out at the finish. Helge
pÂ«n handled the former and outfinishins
young Lloyd Fountain, earned the ver
dict by a neck. Joe Frey cracked no
ice, losing the show to old Mocorito
by, a wide margin.
Term Ryan took his first purse of the
meeting with Flaunt, the aged Forest
er gelding, disposing of a big field in
the mile and fifty yard seiling: fixture.
TV. Davis had the leg up on Major Ten
ny, which was played Â«own to 3 to 2
favoritism. When the Major took the
lead from Play Ball in the stretch it I
looked all over but getting in line.
Flaunt, however, responded to Ander- !
eon's request and coming like a streak
the last fifty yards nipped the favorite
a neck on the wire. Play Ball was a
pood third. ,
Heather Honey annexed the last
puree, starting: at odd? of 11 to 2. Davis
rame from behind with the little mare
and in an Â«xcit!ng drive with Tele
phone and Romaine the favorite re
ceived a neck decision over the for
mer. Romaine was unquestionably
pounds the best, but Sullivan's sleepy
tactics accomplished his downfall.
TRACK NOTES.
Davis did not carry off all the honors,
for HelgÂ»:sen had a good day himself,
piloting two winners and once being
â¢econd.
The Oakland game must have made
'Quite a hit with Tony Barrett, the

Dried Fruits in New York.
Late rntll advices from New Tork say:
Â¦Kr*e arrival* of the principal California pro
ducts are supplying most wants of current
consumption and there ie consequently no
preterit important demand for gpot goods. At
the same time then? Is no accumulation of
stock of any importance in sellers' hand*, and
consequently no pressure to sell Is being <x
erted. Prunes on the Fpot are receiving more
attention thsn other commodities, but the de
mand ik for email lots and for either the large
or the small Â«lze*. The epot stock of the lat
trr. that it. Â«O-Â»Os and Â»0-10<>ii. is practically
exhausted and the offerings of tfaeee sizes from
the coast are small, the supply there having
been closely absorbed by export demands, ac
cording to recent advices. So far as can be
leamrd. not much business has yet resulted
fiom the export inquiry for spot 40s and 50s.
In addition to the jobbing business on do
tTursrtie account some brokers report a good
dÂ«-mand for carload" lots of the sizes most In
favor on a 2tr2',-Â£.e f. o. b. basils for 40s and
X l -tC I. o. b. for other sizes. Not much inter
est is manifested in er>ot seÂ«ded Raisins at
present, as Jobbers are Wing supplied on con
tr&cu out of etock now arriving. Future re
Â«juirc:n*T.ts seem to be receiving no attention.
Arrivals cf London Layers, while not large,
appear to be sufficient to satisfy present

prompt or future delivery. Imported Malagas

that country Was quoted as saying: TVhile
the acreage Is large, the stand Is poor. Im- ,
mediate market will hinge on this factor,
namely, Argentine weather, continuation of
disturbing reports from that country will ex
cite Liverpool and be reflected in higher mar
kets In this country. This is the third day of
advancing market and the short interest has
been pretty well eliminated. We continue to
feel the statistical position In this country
must improve sharply, or we must have a
continuation of disturbing reports from Ar

Another car of Cranberries came in yester
day, and, ' as there were large lines on the
market already, the feeling was weak. Trade
In other fresh fruits was of a light holiday
character and all descriptions were more or
less weak. Receipts included four cars of
Apples and several cars of Oranges. Oranges
moved slowly and the quotations for Navels
had a wider range. The top quotation was
an extreme for the fanciest offerings of well
colored stock and was obtained only for email
parcels, the top for the general run of offer
ings being $2. 25. Apples continued easy at the
old quotations. Grapes arrived freely and met
with a sluggish demand at lower prices, a.
good portion of the receipts being of poor qual
ity. Figs were generally poor and hard to
sell at any price. Berries were In fair request
and attractive lots found prompt sale at steady
rates. ... >-..â¢

Eggs have again declined. The Thanksgiv
ing demand for ranch' was disappointing, as
the public took the cheaper Eastern and cold
storage goods In preference, and - as stocks
continue to increase the market has had to
give way. A number of Â¦ houses offered their
very largest and best ranch at 37%@3Sc yes
terday.
Receipts were 57,200 lbs Butter. 823 cases
Eggs and 32,500 lbs Cheese.

standards and lOQl'lc for seconds.
The condition of the Butter market is best
shown by the continual drive- of . sales of the
large retail stores at prices ranging from 29c
to 32c per square. They are working off large
quantities of tho very finest creameries at
these low prices, as they are very particular
to offer none but the very best brands. The
general range of quotations remains as be
fore, though some houses continue to report a
rather better demand for the best creameries.
Stocks are still large, but are not as excessive
as they have . been for the past month.
There is nothing new In Cheese.

Trade in Poultry was quiet, as Is always the
case immediately after . Thanksgiving, when
tho public demand Is very light. Steady prices
ruled, however, for good Hens and Roosters
and large Fryers, offerings being light. Small
Broilers were- not wanted and sold at a lower
range. Carried-over lots of dressed Turkeys
were cleaned up at prices ranging from 12 %c
to 15c per pound and some poor lots sold down
to lCc. Moat of this carrled-over stock was
bought on speculation- by retailers and placed
In cold storage. Nine cases of fresh stoc!:
came in and sold at the appearing quotations.
Live -.Turkeys sold slowly at sharply reduced
prices. A car of Western Poultry falls due

CHICAGO, Nov. 25. â Bullish 'sentiment pre
vailed In the wheat- pit throughout to-day's
entire Â¦ session. At the start the December
delivery was up %@1*c to %@;fcc at $1 09%
to $1 09?j. May was up ?6@Â«ic to lc at $1 10%
to >110%. The initial advance was due mainly
to a sharp rltsa in wheat prices at Liverpool,
quotations there being up finally Id. The
strength of the English market was said to
be the result of bullish . advices from Argen
tina. Reports from that .country Indicated
that excessive rains had caused delay In har
vest operations, entailing considerable damage
to the crop. 1 Another bullish factor was a dis
patch from Odessa claiming an appreciable
decrease In arrivals and shipments of wheat
there. Domestic conditions also favored thÂ«
bulls. Drouth in the Southwest remained un
broken. Demand for cash wheat was again of
influential character, flour mills at Minneap
olis being good buyers of the higher grades.'
On profit taking the market early lost a por
tion of the opening advance, December easing
off to $1 091k. May declined to $1 00%@l 10.
On -the reaction shorts became active buyers,
causing a quick rally. During the remainder
of the day an excellent demand was In evi
dence, offerings being readily taken. A report
by a St. Louis crop journal telling of -damage
by drouth nn<l Hessian flies was a bullish fac
tor late. The high point of the day was
reached at $1 lO'/i for December. Meantime
May advanced to $1 11. The market closed
strong, with December up T&S'lc at ?1 09%
and May l%c higher at $1 10%.
Higher cables and the strength of wheat
cau.eed a strong corn market. . December
closed %c higher at 49%c.
Outs were firm. December closed %@ Vic
higher at 31%" c.
In spite of tremendous receipts of hogs the
provision market was strong under the. de
mand from a big packing-house. At the close

On reaching home he was taken by
George Fraser to . the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where they found Dr.
C. B. Pinkham on watch. Dr. Pink
ham did not inquire what was the mat
ter with the patient and did not ask
Fraser for his name.
After a cursory examination Pink
ham turned the patient over to Steward
de Vere. who soon sent the patient
home. In the morning Wackford was
found unconscious and was taken again
to the hospital, where he died as soon
as he had been laid. on the operating
table.
Dr. Bacigalupi testified that the blow
or the fall had ruptured the left menln
geal artery , at the base of the brain
and that it was douotrul whether
Wackford's life could have been saved,
even' under "proper treatment.
Mrs. Donahue made a -statement to
the police to the effect that Wackford
had insulted her ; by mistaking . her for
a ; street walker. Donahue said, also
that: when his '.wife informed ' him of
what had happened he. struck Wack
ford and then walked away, not stop
ping to see . whether his victim had
fallen or rot. .
-The evidence tended to show that
Donahue, Frank Rice, Thomas Ham
ersligh, Mrs. Donahue and Mrs. Ham
ersligh were "mixed up" in a street
fight In front of the Donahue residence,
933 Mission street, last Sunday night,
and that Donahue, wno was drunk,
smote several bystanders. Just pre
viously to this free for all affair he
was seen to knock down Wackford
twice. Wackford was an engineer 57
years old. He was a total abstainer
and a religious man, and was on his
way home from church, going toward
his room at 926 Mission street. Before
he became unconscious he told George
Fraser that as he was passing the
Donahue residence he accidentally
trod upon the train of a lady's
dress, apologized, and was knocked
down by a man whom he did
not know. The blow so confused
him that he did not know how to get
home and wandered about an hour and
a half until a lady passer-by directed
him to the house In which he had a
room.
. Involuntary manslaughter was the
verdict given yesterday by a Coroner's
Jury after the inquest on the body of
Thomas Wackford, who died at the
Central Emergency Hospital last Mon
day morning from the indirect effects
of a blow delivered by a drunken team
ster named Frank Donahue. The hos
pital authorities were censured for neg
ligence and indifference in the treat
ment of the case, that portion of the
verdict reading as follows:
. We wish to severely censure the hospital
Attendants for their gross carelessness and
lax methods In treating patients in general
and in this Dartlcular case In allowing the
patient to so away without proper examina
tion.

With Poison.
Because her son swore at her, Mrs.
-Martha .McKenna of 546 Grovo street
attempted to end her life last night
by drinking two ounces of carbolic
acid. Had she not mixed the liquid
with claret, thus obtaining a chemi
cal antidote through the alcohol in
the liquor, her life would have been
ended.
Mrs. McKenna's son, who aha
claims was responsible for her rash
act, came home to supper and round
ly cursed his parent because the meal
Â¦was not ready. When the son's back
was turned his mother poured the
contents of a bottle of the acid in a
glass of claret. The son saw her ac
tions, but too late to prevent her from
drinking the dose.
The woman was rushed to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital, where Dr,
Hill succeeded In reviving her.

and ran away with it. His exit was

bors, who shrieked -an alarm,, and the
ensuing chase .was concluded by the
fugitive's capture In | Columbia square.;
Then it was found that his plunder was
not a turkey, but a complete ham.
Judge Conlan apparently considered
the quality of the loot or no conse

to six months' imprisonment.

and Miss Alexander called Signer Cas

Michael Foley, teamster, was whip
ping his horse unnecessarily on Post
street, between Jones and Taylor, when
Mrs. L. J. Wheelock of 247 O'Farrell
street begged him to desist. Mr. Foley
requested her to attend to her own
business, and In resentment of her in
terference lashed the beast more vig
orously than before.
"If you don't stop I'll get you arrest
ed," said Mrs. Wheelock.
"Where'll you get your cop?" inquired
Mr. Foley. still plying his whip.
Mrs. Wheelock answered the query
by walking around a corner and tele
phoning her, complaint to the nearest
police station. Then she returned to
Mr. Foley and entertained him by de
nouncing his conduct until a patrolman,
sent in response to her summons,
caught him fairly in the act of exhibit
ing his defiance by punishing the un
fortunate animal with augmented se
verity.
Judge Conlan complimented Mrs.
Wheelock and ordered Mr. Foley to re
appear this morning for sentence.
"Stop nothin'," repeated the defend
ant in a louder key. "If you're deaf I'll
sing it to you," and she restored her
attention to sister Anna's testimony
and resumed her running comment on
it, while Hickey stood as one petrified
and all the court wondered. Bailiff Ma
honey was first to emerge from the
spell. He grasped Miss Kelly's should
er with no gentle hand and in stern
whisper commanded her to abstain
from talking until she was summoned
to the witness stand, but she shook oft
his clutch and turning upon him ex
claimed: "Well, I declare what are you
buttin' in for I'd like to know; haven't
I just said 'Stop nothin',' and you can
bet your life I mean it. Nice thing I'm
sure if a lady can't speak without lies
being told about her but I'm going to
have my Eay ifâ"
It was at that juncture the abrupt
passing of sentence transformed Miss
Kelly's volubility into the laugh, pro
longed and derisive.
"Stop nothin'," retorted Miss Kelly,
saucily tossing her head until the bead
bangles on her hat rattled like a casta
net solo. ;
"What's that?" gasped the bailiff,
with portentous frown.
MIss Teresa Kelly's declination to be
silenced by reproving glances from Po
lice Judge Mogan created no sensation
in court, but when she openly defied
the previously unquestioned authority
of Bailiff Hickey the other attaches of
the tribunal gasped and were spell
bound. From the moment she 'was
placed before the bench to answer a
charge of disturbing the peace until she
was sentenced to three months' impris
onment Miss Kelly's tongue never
ceased to wag, and even then she only
stopped talking to utter a loud and de
risive laugh that was sustained until
she disappeared jailward.
It was the peace of her sister, Mrs.
Anna Gaynor of 508 Minna street, that
Miss Kelly disturbed. After smashing
several treasured household gods be
longing to sister Anna she had threat
ened to burn down that lady's home,
and was proceeding to put the threat
into execution when her arrest vras ef
fected as a preventive measure. While
the. complaining witness was narrating
her grievance the defendant rapidly in
terjected contradictions until Bailiff
Hickey turned upon her a baleful eye
and ejaculated in peremptory tone,
"Stop that!"

Abe Raymond (colored) warned Pa
