But Mariposa seemed encouragingly
composed. She again felt the curious
sense of ease, of being at home ; with
him, that this unknown man had given
hÂ«r before. She had that inspiring sen
sation that she was approved; that this
old-time friend . of her father's had a
singular unspoken sympathy' with her.
"As if he might . have been "ah old

first meeting, "of some kind of relation

reached its .climax when a carriage ap

had struck, and Mariposa, with a last
kiss to her mother,, ran down the steps
toward the door Into the corridor.
"She's some singing lady," answered
that youth drawlingly, tilting his chair
still farther back, "what's come to see
Mr. Shackleton" about sin ping at the

The, young man, withont further

The Trumpet office, as all old San
Franciscans know, stood on Third
street, and T.as, in its day, considered
a fine building. Jake- Shackleton had
not been its owner six months yet, and
all his reforms were not inaugurated.
From the yawning arch of its doorway
liights of stairs led up and upward,
from stories where the presses rattled
all night, to the editorial story where
the sentiments of The Trumpet staff
were confided to paper. This latter and
most important department was four
flights up the dark stairway, which was
lit at Its turnings with* large kerosene
lamps, backed by tin reflectors. There
was little of the luxury of the modern
newspaper office about the barren, bus
iness-like building, echoing like an
empty shell to the shouts of men and
the pounding of machinery.
At the ton of the fourth flight the
ladles paused. The landing broadened
out into a sort of ante-room, bare and
windowles8, two dejected-looking gas
jets dispensing a tarnished yellow light
into the surrounding gloom. A boy,
with a sleek, oiled head, sat at a table
reading that morning's issue of The
Trumpet.. He put It down as Mrs. Wil
lers rose before his vision. and nodded
familiarly to her. She gave, him- a
quick word of greeting and swept Mari
posa forward through a doorway, down
a long passage, from which doors
opened Into tiny rooms with desks and
dropllghts. The girl now and then had
glimpses ' of men seated < at ' the desks,
the radiance of the droplightB hard on
their faces that had been lifted expec
tantly as their ears caught the Interest
ing rustle of skirts In the corridor.
Suddenly, at the end of the passage, .
Mrs. Willers struck with her- knuckles
on a closed portal. The next moment
Mariposa, with the light of a large win
dow shining full on her face; was shak
ing hands with Shackleton. Then, in
response to his motioning hands, she
took the chair, beside the desk, where
she sat, "facing the" white glare of. the
window, conscious of his keen eyes
critically regarding her. Mrs. Willers
took a "chair in the background. Fora
moment she had fears that the nerv-
CHAPTER V.
TRIAL FLIGHTS
"The music of the moon
Sleeps in the plain eggs of the nightin
gale." â Tennyson.
A. week had not passed since the
night at the opera when Mariposa re
ceived a hasty letter from Mrs. Willers.
It was only a few lines scrawled on a
piece of the yellow paper affected by
the staff of The Trumpet, and advising
the recipient of the fact that Mr.
Shackleton requested her presence at
his office at three the following after
noon, yet a suggestion of triumph
breathed from Its every word. Mrs.
Willers was clearly elated at the mo
ment of its production. She hinted in a
closing sentence, that Mariposa's star
was rising rapidly. She, herself, would
conduct the girl to the presence of the
great man, and suggested that Mari
posa meet her in her rooms a half
hour before the time set for the inter
view.
Mariposa was glad to do this, and in
the few moments' walk across town
toward Third street, to hear what Mrs.
Willers thought was the object of the
Interview.-. The girl's cheeks were dyed
with excited color as they drew near
The Trumpet office. Mrs. Willers was
certain it was ta do with her singing.
Shackleton had almost told her as
much. He had been immensely im
pressed by 'her voice, and now, with
the Lepine Opera Company In the city,
Mrs. Will?is fancied he was going to
have Lc:>ir.e, who was a well-known
impresario in a small but respectable
way. pass judgment on it. Mariposa's
foot lagged when she heard this. It
was such a portentous step from th*
seclusion of a rose-draped cottage in
Santa Barbara, even t* this talk of
singing before a real impresario. She
looked down the vista of-^hird street
where the facade of The Trumpet office
loomed large from humbler neighbors,
and Mrs. Wlllers saw hesitation and
fright in her eyes. Like a sensible
guardian she slipped her hand through
the young girl's arm and walked brisk
ly forward, talking of the rare chances
life offers to a handicapped humanity.
As the curtain fell for the third time,
she turned to Essex, paie and large
eyed, and said breathlessly:
"I could sing as well as that woman
if I had more lessons; I know I could!
I know it!"
found a somewhat mean amusement in
teasing the girl; "you might Just "as
well have been called Eschscholtzla
Poppy."
The spirited reply which was on Mar
iposa's lips was stopped by the rising of
the curtain. Â¦ The crowded, rustling
house settled itself into silence, the
orchestra's subdued notes relied out
v.ith the voices swelling above them
into the listening auditorium. Â¦ '
The rest of the evening was an en
chanted dream to her. She had never
seen an opera, and for the first time re
alized what it might mean to possess a
voice. She heard the house thunder its
applause to Leonora, and thought of
herself as singing: thus, standing alone
on that dim stage, looking out over the
sea of faces, all listening, all staring,
ail spellbound, hanging on the notes
that fe!l, sweet and rich, thrilling and
passionate, from her lips. Could there
be such a life for hsr? Did they tell the
truth when they spoke eo admiringly
of her vcice? Could she ever sing like
this? A surge of exultant conviction
rose in her, and sent Its whisper of hope
aud ambition to her throbbing brain.
As the opera progressed she grew
pale ar.cl motionless. The wild thought
was s-ining possession of her. that she,
Marlpcsa Mcreau, with her four pupils
and sixteen dollars a month, could sing
as well us this woman of European re
nown, for whom Eesex, the critical,
the vastly experienced, had words of
praise. Once or twice it seemed to her
as if the notes were swelling in her own
throat, were pressing to Durst out and
soar up. higher, fuller, richer than the
weman's on the stage. Oh. the rapture
of being able to pour out one's voice,
to give wild, melodious expression to
love or despair, while a thousand peo
ple hung this way on one's lips!
"We will mount to the stage this way,
Mademoiselle." said Lepine, and he in
dicated a small flight of steps that rose
from the corner of the orchestra to
the lip of the stage above.
He ascended first, she close at his
heels, and In a moment found herself
on the dark, deserted stage. It seemed
enormous to her, stretching back into
unseen regions where the half-deflned
shapes of trees and castles, walls and
benches were huddled In dim confu
sion. Down the aisles between side
scenes she,causht glimpses of vistas lit
by wavering gleams of light People
moved here and there, across these
vistas, their footsteps sounding singu
larly distinct. As she stood uneasily.
looking to the right and left, a sudden
sound of hammering arose from some
where behind, loud and vibrant. Le
pine, who was about to descend thÂ»
stairs, turned and shouted a furious
sentence in Italian down the opening.
Mariposa drew back from him. won
dering if she were to sing there and
then. Lepine was behind her. and be
hind him she saw, with a sense of
nostalgic loneliness, that the Italian
conductor was- shepherding Mrs. Will
ers and Shackleton into two seats on
the aisle. They looked small and far
away.
She handed him the two songs she
had brought, "Knowest Thou the
Land." from "Mlxnon." and "Farewell.
Lc-chaber." In the short period of her
tuition her teacher had told her that
*he had sung "Lochaber" admirably.
The man opened them, glanced at the
names, and placing the "Mignon" aria
on the rack, ran his hands lightly and
carelessly over the keys In the opening
bars of the accompaniment.
"Whenever the lady is ready," hÂ«
said, with an air of patience, as though
he had endured this form of persecu
tion until all spirit of revolt was
crushed. '*'â¢/.Â¦
One was a short and stout French
man, with a turned-over collar, upon
which a double chin rested. He had a
bald forehead and eyes that gleamed
sharply from behind a pince-nez. At
sight of the trio, he gave an exclama
tion and came forward.
"Our young lady?" he said to Mari
posa. giving her a quick look of scru
tiny that seemed to take her in from
foot to forehead. Then he greeted
Shackleton with slightly exaggerated
foreign effusion. He spoke English
perfectly, but with the inevitable ac
cent. This was Lepine. the impresario,
and tho other man, an Italian who
spoke little English, T.as presented as
Slgnor Tojettl, conductor.
They moved forward talking, and
then, pushing the door open, Lepine
motioned Mariposa to enter. She did
so and for a moment stood amazed,
staring Into a vast, shadowy space,
where, in what seemed a vague, unde
fined distance, a tiny spot or two of
light cut in the darkness. The air was
chili and smelt of a t table. From
somewhere she heard the sound of
voices rising and falling, and then
again the notes of a piano, now near
and unobscured, carelessly touched and
resembling, in the echoing hollow spa
ciousness of the great building, the
thin, tinkling sounds emitted by smit
ten glass.
Lepine brushed past her and led the
way down the aisle? As she followed
him her eyes became accustomed to
the dimness, and she began to make
out the arch of the stage with black
ness beyond. Into which cut the circles
of light of a few gas-jets. The lines of
seats - stretched before her spectral in
linen covers. Now and then a figure
crossed the stage, and as they drew
nearer, she saw on one side of It a man
sitting on a high stool reading a pap<?r
book by the light of a shaded lamp.
The notes of the piano sounded sharper
and closer, and by their proximity
more than by her sight, she located it
in a dark corner of the orchestra. As
voices came from this corner, then sud
denly a man's smothered laugh.
"Mr. Martinez," said Lepine, direct
ing his voice toward the darkness,
whence the laugh had arisen, "the lady
is here to sing, if you are ready."
Instantly a faintly luminous spark.
Mariposa had noticed, bloomed into the
full-blown radiance of a gas-jet turned
full cock under a sheltering shade. It
projected, what seemed in the dim
ness, a torrent of light on the key
board of the piano. Illuminating a pair
of masculine hands that had been mov
ing over the keys in the darkness". Be
hind them the girl . saw a shadowy
shape, and then a spectacled face under
a mane of drooping black hair was ad
vanced into the light.
"Has the lady her music?" said the
face, in English, but with another va
riety of accent.
They alighted, and as they turned in
to the flagged entrance that led to the
foyer, Shackleton came forward to
meet them. He looked older in the
crude afternoon light, his face showing
the lines that his fiercely lived life had
plowed in It. But he smiled reaÂ«suÂ»
lngly at Marlposa and pressed her
hand.
'â¢Everything's all ready." he said:
"Leplne's put back a rehearsal for us.
bo we .mustn't keep him waiting. And
are you all ready to surprise us?" he
aaked, as they walked together toward
where the three steps led to the foyer.
"I'm ready to do my best," she an
swered; "a person can't do more than
that."
The answer pleased him, as every
thing she said did. He saw she was
nervous, but that she was going to
conquer herself.
"L*>ts of grit." he said to himself as
he gave ear to a remark of Mrs. Wll
lers*. "She won't quit at the first ob
stacle."
They passed through the opening In
the brass ral! that led to the foyer.
This space, the gathering place of the
radiant beings of Marlposa's first night
at the opera, was now a dimly lit and
deserted hall, Its flagged flooring look-
Ing dirty In the raw light. From some
where, in what seemed a far, dreamy
distance, the sound of a piano came, as
if muffled by numerous doors. As they
crossed the foyer toward the entrance
Into the auditorium, the door swung
open and two men appeared.
Darin* the drive Mrs. Wlllers talked
on outside matters. She was business
like and quiet to-day. Even her clothes
seemed to partake of her practical
mood and were Inconspicuous and sub
dued. As the carriage turned down
Mission street she herself began to ex
perience qualms. What If they had all
been mistaken and the girl's voice was
nothing out of the ordinary? What a
cruel disappointment, and with that
sick, helpless mother! What she said
was: '
"Now, here we are! Remember that
you've got the finest voice Leplne's ever
likely to hear, and you're going to sing
your best."

Shackleton when, two hours later, he
alighted from .the. carriage at the step3.
of his country .house.. He went upstairs
to his own rooms with a buoyant. tread.
In his library, with the windows thrown

' For the second time that afternoon
Mrs. Willers was conscious that words

her employer. Now he said, with, more
than an edge of sharpness to his words:

queer French expression of quizzical
amusement.

"Signor Tojetti," said Shackleton,
"seems to think that two years of study
â¢w ould be ample to fit you for the oper

"Come down, quick! They think it's
fine. Oh, dearie," stretching up a help-

over the line of the footlights, "you did

turned toward her and gave a slight
emile.
Mariposa walked toward the box,
feeling suddenly shy. As she drew
nearer she saw the woman's face more
distinctly. It was a dark French face,
Tvith a brunette skin warming to brick
dust red on the cheeks, set in a frame
of wiry black hair, and with a big
mouth that, laughing, showed strong
wtiite teeth, well separated. As Mari
posa saw it fairly in the light of an ad
jacent lamp she recognized it as that of
the Leonora of "II Trovatore." It was
the prima donna.
She started forward with flushing
cheek and held out a hesitating hand.
The fat. ungloved palms of the singer
closed on it with Gallic effusion. Mari
posa was aware of something delight
fully wholesome and kind in the broad,
ruddy visage, with its big, smiling
mouth and firm teeth like the halves
of cleanly broken hazelnuts. The sing
er, leaning over the rail, poured a
rumbling volume of French into the
girl's blushing, upturned face. Mari
posa understood it and was trying to
answer in her halting schoolgirl
phrases, when the voice of Mrs. Willers.
st the bottom of the steps, summoned
her.
exultation. She had never realized
what it was to sing before people who
knew and who listened in this way in
a place that was large enough.
When the last notes died away, the
tinkling of the piano sounding like the
frail specters of music after the tones
of the rich, vibrant voice, there was a
sudden noise of clapping hands. It
came from the box on the right, where
the woman in the ulster was leaning
over the rail, clapping, with her bare
hands held far out.
"Bra vat" she cried in a loud, full
voice. "Brava ! La belle voix! Et quei
volume! Brava!"
She bounced round on her chair to
look at the man beside her, and, lean
ing forward, clapped again, crying her
gay "brava."
The second song, "Loehabe'r." had
been chosen by Mariposa's teacher to
show off her lower register â those curi
ous, disturbing notes that were so deep
and full of vague melancholy. She had
gained such control as she had over her
voice and sang with an almost joyous
Mariposa raised her chest with a deep
inspiration. A sudden excited expecta
tion seized her at the thought of let
ting her voice swell out into the hushed
void before her. The listening people
sÂ»*med so small and insignificant in it.
they suddenly lost their terror. She be
gan to sing.
It seemed to her that her first notes
were hardly audible. They seemed as
ineffectual as the piano. Then her
confidence grew, and delight with it.
She never before had felt as if she had
enough room. He/ voice rolled itself
out like a breaking wave, lapping the
walls of the building.
The first verse came to an end. The
accompaniment ceased. Lepine moved
in his distant seat.
"Continue. Mademoiselle." he said
sharply; "the second verse, if you
please. Again. Mr. Martinez."
Mariposa saw the woman in the box
look at the man beside her, raise her
eyebrows, and nod.
She began the second verse and sang
it through. As Its last notes died out
there was silence for a moment. In the
silence the Italian conductor rose and
came forward to where Lepine sat.
Mariposa, standing on the stage, saw
them conferring for a space. The Ital
ian talked in a low voice, with much
gesticulation. Shaekletcm and Mrs.
Willers were motionless and dumb.
The woman in the box began fo whis
per with the man.
"And now the second piece, if Made
moiselle has no objection." came the
voice of the impresario across the par
quet: "One cannot judge well from one
sime."
The first bars of the accompaniment
sounded thinly. Mariposa stepped for
ward. She could see in the shadowy
emptiness of the auditorium Lepine's
bald head where he sat alone, half way
up the house, and the two pale faces of
Rhackleton and Mrs. Willers. The
Italian conductor had left them and
was sitting by himself at one side of
the parquet. In the stillness, the notes
cf the piano v.ere curiously tinkling
and feeble.
"Quite ready." replied Mariposa.
hearing her voice like a tremulous
thread of sound in the stillness.
"Now. Mademoiselle." he said, speak
ing from the orchestra, "if you are
ready, come forward a little, nearer the
footlights there."
Mariposa moved forward. Her heart
was beating in her throat, and she felt
a sick terror at the thought of what her
voice would be like in that huge void
space. She was aware that the man
who had been reading the paper book
had closed it and was leaning his el
bow on the lamp stand, watching her.
She was also aware that a woman and
a man had suddenly appeared In the
lower procsnium box close beside her.
She ?aw the woman dimly, a fat, short
figure :n a light-colored ulster. Whis
pering to the man, she drew one of the
"Ineri -covered chairs close to the rail
its and seated herself.
"Is the lady ready?" said the pianist,
from his dark corner.
The hammering instantly ceased, ind a.
man In white overalls came and stared
at the stage. The impresario, charily
âbeing short and fatâ descended the
stairs. Â¦ .'.
"Why didn't you send Mrs. Brown for
me? I was in my room passing the time
till you woke up."
"I was thinking and I wanted to fin
ish. I have been thinking a long time,
days and weeks."
Mariposa thought her mind was wan
dering, and sitting down on a chair by
the bedside, took her hand and pressed
it gently without speaking. Her
mother lay in the same attitude, her
profile toward her. her eyes looking va
cantly at the screen. Suddenly she
said:
"You know my old desk, the little
rosewood one Dan gave me? Take my
keys and open It, and in the bottom
you'll see two envelopes, with no writ
ing. One looks dirty and old. Bring
them to me here."
Mariposa rose wondering, and looking
anxiously at her mother. The elder
woman Â«aw the look, and said weakly
and almost peevishly: - j
"Go; be quick. I am not strong
enough to talk long. The keys are in
the workbox." ''-*â¢;
The girl obeyed as quickly as possi
ble. The desk was a small one resting
on the center table. It had been a
present of her father's to her mother,
and she remembered lt-from her earli
est childhood in a prominent position
in'her mother's room. She opened It,
and in a few moments, under old let
ters, memorand" ad souvenirs, found
the two envelopes. Carrying them to
the bed she gave them to her mother.
Lucy took, them with. an unsteady
hand, and for a moment lay staring at
her daughter and not moving. Then
she said:
"Put the pillows under my head. It's
easier to breathe when I'm higher,"
and as Mariposa arranged them, she
added, in a lower voice: "And .tell Mrs.
Brown to so; I want to be alono with
you."
Mariposa looked out beyond the
screen, and seeing thÂ» nurse still read-
The girl rose from the bed trying to
compose her face. In the light of the
open door the woman saw its distress
and lo-oked at her pityingly.
"Don't tire her," she said, "but I ad
vise you to say all you have to say. She
may not be this way again."
Maripcsa crossed tne room to the bed.
Her mother was lying on her side,
pinched, pale and with darkly circled
eyes.
"Have you just waked up, darling?"
said the girl, tenderly.
â¢Xo," she answered, with a curious
lack of response in manner and tone;
"I have been awake some time. I was
thinking."
A Japanese screen was half-way
about the bed. shutting it from the
drafts of the door, anil in its shelter
Lucy lay sleeping her light breathless
sleep. In this shaded light, in the re
laxed attitude of*nnconsciousness, she
presented the appearance of a young
girl hardly older than her daughter.
Yet the hand pf death was plainly on
her. as even Mariposa could now see.
Without sound th? girl passed from
the room to her own beyond. Her grief
had seized her, and the truth, fought
against with- the desperate inexperi
ence of youth, forced itself on her. Sha
threw herself on her bed and lay there
battling with the sickness of despair
that such knowledge brings. Twilight
faded and darkness came. In answer
to the servant's tap on the door, and
announcement of dinner, she called
back that she desired none-. The room
was as dark about her as her own
thoughts. From the door that led into
the sick chamber, only partly closed, a
shaft of light cut the blackness, and on
this light she fastened her eyes,
swollen with tears, feeling herself stu
pefied with sorrow.
As she lay thus on the bed, she heard
the creakins of the wicker-chair as the
nurse arose, then came the clink of the
spoon and the glass, and the woman's
low voice, and then her mother's
stronger and clearer than It had been
for some days. There was an Inter
change of remarks between nurse and
patient, the sound of careful steps, and
the crack of light suddenly expanded
as the door was opened. Against this
background, clear and smoothly yellow
as gold leaf, the nurse's figure waa re
vealed In sharp silhouette.
"Are you there, iliss Moreau?" she
said, in a low voice. Maripoaa started
with a hurried reply.
"Weil, your mother wants to see you
and you'd better come. Her mind
seems much clearer and it may not be
so 'again."
ter, Mrs. Willers had gone to the office
of The Trumpet, frowning in her sym
pathetic pain. It was Saturday, and
Shackleton had already left for Menlo
Park when she reached the office. But
she determined to see him early on
Monday and. tell him of the straits of
his old friend's widow and child. Mrs.
Wfllers knew the signs of the scarcity
of money, and knew also the over
whelming expenses of sickness. What
she did not know was that on Friday
morning Mariposa had wept over her
check book, and then gone out and sold
the diamond brooch.
The long Sunday â the interminable
day of strained anxiety â passed,
shrouded in rain. When her mother
fell into the â¢ light sleep that now
marked her condition, Mariposa me
chanically went to the window of the
bedroom and looked out. It was one
of those blinding rains that usher in
the San Francisco winter, the water
falling in straight lances that show
against the light like thin tubes of
glass, anil strike the pavement with a
vicious impact which splinters them in
to spray. It drummed on the tin roof
above the bedroom with an incessant
hollow suund, and ran in a torn ribbon
of water frcm the gutter on the eaves.
The prospects that th? window com
manded seemed in dreariness to match
the girl's thoughts. That part of Pine
street was still in the unfinished condi
tion describe d by the v,ord3 "far out."
Vacant lots yawned between the
houses: the badly puved roadbed waa
an csparss of deeply ratted mud, with
yellow >jyrÂ»ds of rain at the sewer
mouths. The broken wooden sidewalk
gleamed with moisture and was evenly
striped with lines cf vivid ?reen where
the srass sprouted between the boards.
Now and then a wayfarer hurried by.
crouched under the dome Â«>f an um
brella spouting water from every rib.
The gray twilight settled early, and
llariposa, dropping the curtain, turned
to the room behind her. The light of a
small fire ar.d a shaded lamp sen* u
softened glow over the apartment,
which, despite its poverty, bespoke the
taste of gentlewomen in the simple
prettiness of its furnishings. The
purse, a middle-aged woman of a kind
ly and capable aspect, sat by the fire in
a wicker rocking-chair, reading a pn
per. Bestde her, on a table, stood the
sickroom paraphernalia of glasses and
bottles. The regular cr^ak of the rL-e!:
ing chair, and an occasional snap from
the fire, were the only sounds that
punctuated* the steady drumming of the
rain on the tin roof.
An atmosphere of illness settled
down like a fog on .the . little cottage.
A nurse appeared; the doctors seemed
to be in the house many times a day.
Mrs. Willers, as, soon as she .hearth
came up, no longer overdressed and
foolish, ; but - grave and helpful. After
a : half hour spent at Lucy's bedside,
wherein- the sick woman had spoken
little, and then only about aer daugh-
But Lucy knew that she was dying.
Her feeble body had received Its coup
de grace on the day that Mrs. Willers
brought the news of Shaekleton's wish
to- see his child. Since then she had
spent long hours in thought. . When her
mind was clear enough she had pon
dered on the situation, trying to see
what was best to do for Mariposa's
welfare. The problem that . faced her
terrified her. The dying woman was
having the last struggle with herself.
One week after the recital at the
opera-house she had grown so much
worse that Mariposa had called In the
doctor they had had in attendance, .off
and on. since their j arrival. He was
grave and there, was a consultation.
When she saw their faces the cold
dread that had been slowly growing In
the girl's heart seemed suddenly to ex
pand and chill her -whole being. Mrs.
Moreau was undoubtedly very ill,
though there was still hope. Yet their
looks were sober and pitying as they
listened to the daughter's reiterated as
severations .that her.mother had often
been v.tnse and made a successful rally.

From the day when Mrs. Willers had
appeared with the news of Shackle
ton's interest in her daughter, Lucy's
health had steadily waned. The pro
cess of decay was so quiet, albeit so
sure and swift, that Mariposa, accus
tomed to the uj)s and downs of her
mother's invalid condition, was un
aware that the elder woman's sands
were almost run. The pale intensity,
the coldness of the hand gripped round
hers, that had greeted her account of
the recital at the opera-house, seemed
to the girl only the reflection of her own '
eager exultation. She was blind, not
only from ignorance, but from the
egotistic preoccupations of her youth.
It seemed impossible to think of her
mother's failing in her loving response,
now that the sun was rising on their
dark horizon.
Presently the sound of a piano floated
out from the music room. The man
stopped his pacing, listened for an in
stant, and then passed round to the
side of the house. The French windows
of the music room v.ere opened, throw
ing elongated squares of light over tha
balcony and the grass beyond. He
paused â¢ in the darkness and looked
through c-ne of them. There, like a
painting framed by the window casing,
was Pussy Thurston seated at the pi
ano singing, whiJe Maud sat near by
listening.) One of Miss Thurston's
most admired social graces was the gift
of song. She had a small agreeable
voice, and had been well taught; but
the Sight, frail tones sounded thin in
the wide silence cf the night. It was
the_feebly pretty- performance of the
"accomplished young lady."
Shackleton listened with a slight
smile that increased as the song drew
to a close. As it ceased he moved
away, the red light of his cigar coming
and going In the darkness.
"Singing!" he said to himself, "they
call that singing! Wait till they hear
my daughter!"
The night was warm and odorous
with the scent of hidden blossoms.
Now and then his foot crunched the
gravel' of a path, as his walk took him
back and forth over the lone stretch of
lawn broken by flower beds and narrow
walks. The srreat bulk of the house,
its black mass illumined by congeries
of lit windows, showed an inky, irreg
ular outltne against the star-strewn
sky.
"Well, you and I. Pussy." said Shack
leton, "seem to be the only two who've
got any enthusiasm. You'll have to
try and put seme into Maud, and if the
worst comes to the worst we can kid
nap the old lady."
He was in an unusually good temper,
and the dinner was animated and
merry. Only Maud, after the Eu/opean
suggestion, grew more stolidly quiet
than ever. But shp cheered herself by
the thought that the. spring was six
months off yet, and who could tell what
might happen in six months?
After dinner the ladies repaired to the
music room, and Shackleton, following
a custom of his. passed through one
of the long windows into the garden,
there to pace up and down while he
smoked his cigar.
Maud did not like the thought of
going at all. In this little party of
four, two were moved in their actions
by secret predilections of which the
others were ignorant. Maud thought
of leaving her love affair at the critical
point it had reached, and, with a aguish
at her heart, looked heavily indifferent.
"I don't know." she said, crumbling
her bread, "I don't think it's such fun
in Europe. You just travel round in
little stuffy trains, and have to live in
hotels without baths." -
Mrs. Shackleton looked surprised and
no.t greatly elated. On their last trip
to Europe, two years before, her hus
band haf been so bored by the joys of
foreign travel that she had made up
her mind she would never ask him to
go again. Now she said:
"But you don't want to go to Europe.
You said last time you hated it."
"Did I? Yes. I guess I did. Well, I'm
prepared to like it this time. We could
take a spin over. in the spring tor Lon
don and Paris. We'd make quite a
stay in Paris, and you women could
buy clothes. You'd come, too, Pussy,
wouldn't you?" he said, turning to the
girl.
Her color rose now and her eyes
sparkled. She had never been even to
New*York.
"Wouldn't I?" she said. "That does
make me smile."
"I thought so," he answered good hu
mgredly â "and Maud, you'd like it, of
course?"
She was so used to such remarks that
her rose-leaf color did not vary the
fraction of a shade. Maud, to whom
no one ever paid compliments, looked
at her with wistful admiration.
"Is that all?" she said with an air of
disappointment. "I- hoped it was some
thing that would make us all smile."
"Well, I have an idea that may make
you all smile" â he turned to his wife â
"how would you like to go to Europe
next spring, Bessie?"
The man vouchsafed no answer, to
this remark for a moment; then he
said: i . ;
"The mother's health is very, delicate?
"Tojetti also thinks that the appear
ance of Mademoiselle is much in her
favor. She has an admirable stage
presence" â he, looked at Mariposa as if
she were 'a piece of furniture he was
appraising. "Her height alone is of in
estimable value. She would have at
least five feet eight or nine inches!"
At this moment the lady in the box.
who had risen to her feet, and was
leaning against the railing, called sud- -
denly:
"Lepine,' vraiment une belle voix, et
aussi une belle fille! Vous avez fait une
trouvaille." â¢ . Â¦
Lepine wheeled round to his star, who
in the shadowy light stood, a pale-col
ored, burly figure, buttoning her ulster
over her redundant chest.
"A moment," he said, apologetically
to the others, and. running to the box,
stood with his head back, talking to
her. while the prima donna leaned over
and a rapid interchange of French sen
tences passed between them.
Slgnor Tojetti turned to Mariposa,
and. with solemn effort, produced an
English phrase: .
"Eet ees time to went." Then he
waved his hand toward the stage. The
sound of feet echoed therefrom, and as
Mariposa looked, an irruption of vague,
spectral shapes rose from tome unseen
cavernous entrance and peopled the or
chestra.
"It's the rehearsal," she said. "We
must be going."
They moved forward toward the en
trance, the auditorium behind them be
ginning to resound with the noise of
the Incoming performers. A scraping
of strings came from the darkened or
chestra, and mingled with the tenta
tive chords struck from the piano. At
the door Lepine joined them, falling in
to step beside Shackleton and convers-
ing with him in low tones. Signor To
jetti escorted them to the brass rail and
there withdrew with low bows. The
ladies made out that the rehearsal de
manded his presence.
Once again in the gray light of the
afternoon they stood for a moment at
the curb waiting for the carriage.
Lepine offered his farewells to Mari
posa and his wishes to see her again.
"In Par!?," he said, giving his little
quizzical smile â "that is the place in
which I should like to see* Made
moiselle." * " ' 1
"We'll talk about that again," said
Shackleton; "I'm going to see Mr Le
pine before he goes and have another
talk about you. You see, you're be
coming a very important young lady."
The carriage rolled up and Mariposa
was assisted In, several street boys
watching her with wide-eyed interest
as evidently a personage of distinction.
Her face at the window smiled a ra
diant farewell at the group on the side
walk; then she sank back breathless
What an afternoon! Would the carriage
ever get her home, that she might poif
it all out to her mother! What a thrill
ing, wonderful, unheard-of afternoon!;
CHAPTER VI.
THE VISION AND THE DREAM.
'â¢For a dream cometh through the multitude
of business." â Eccleslaates.
As the carriage turned the corner into
Third street, Shackleton and Mrs.
Willers, bidding their adieux to Lepine,
started toward The Trumpet office. The
building was not ten minutes' walk
away, and both the proprietor and the
woman reporter had work there that
called them.
In their different ways each was ex-.
ceedingly elated. The man, with his
hard, bearded face, the upper half
shaded by the brini of his soft felt hat.
gave no evidence in appearance or
manner of the exultation that pos
sessed him. But. the woman, with her
more febrile and less self-contained na
ture, showed her excited gratification
in her reddened cheeks and the spark
ling animation of her tired eyes. Her
state of joyous triumph was witnessed
even in her walk, in the way she
swished her skirts over the pavements,
in the something youthful and buoyant
that had crept into the tones of her
voice.
"Well," she said, "that was an experi
ence worth having! I never heard her
sing so before. She Just outdid hsr
self."
"She certainly seemed to me to- sing
well. I was doubtful at the beginning,
not knowing any more about singing
than I "do about Sanskrit, as to whether
she really had as fine a voice as we
thought. But there don't seem to me
to be any doubt about it now."
"Lepine is quite certain, is he?"
queried Mrs. Willers, who had tried to
listen to the conversation between her
chief and the impresario on the way
out, but had been foiled by Maripvsa's
excited chatter.
"He says that she has an unusually
fine voice, which, with proper tra'ning,
would, as far as they can say no\v, be
perfectly suitable for grand- opera. It's
what they call a dramatic mezao-so
prano, with something particularly
good about the lower notes. Lepine is
to see jrne again before he goes."
"Did he suggest what she ought to
do?"
"Yes; he spoke of Paris as the best
place to send her. He knows some fa
mous teacher there that he says is the
proper person for her to study with.
H<; seemed to think that two years of
study would be sufficient for her. She'd
re ready to make her appearance in
grand cpera after that time." Â¦
"Good heavens!" breathed Mrs. Will
ers in a transport of pious triumph,
'Â¦Just think of it! And now up in that
cottage on Pine street getting 50 cents
a lesson, and with only four pupils."
"In two years," eaid Shackleton. who
was speaking more to himself than to
her, "the'll be 27 years oldâ -just in her
r.rime." . .
â¢She'll be 26." corrected Mrs Willers:
"she's only 24 now."
He raised his brows with a little air
of an, used apology. â¢
"Twenty- four, is it?" he said. "WH1.
that's all the better. Twenty-six is one
year better than twenty-seven."
"It'll be like the 'Innocents Abroad'
to see her and her mother in , Paris,"
said Mrs. Willers. "They're Just two.
of the most unsophisticated females,
that ever stra yed out of the golden
age." â¢ ") ;

good master It should be a truly de
lightful one."
The Italian, to whom these sentences
were only half Intelligible, now broke
In with a quick series of sonorous
phrases, directed to Lepine,' .but now
and then turned upon Shackleton.
Mariposa's eyes went from one to the
other in an effort to understand. â¢ The
impresario, listening with frowning in
tentness. responded with a nod and a
word of brusk acquiescence. Turning
to Shackleton, he said:
She's quite an invalid, you say?"
"Quite. But she's one of the sweetest,
most uncomplaining women you ever
laid eyes on. You'd "understand . the
daughter better if you knew, the moth
er. She's so gentle and girlish. And

"Is Mrs. Moreau's state of health too

Shackleton, interrupting suddenly and

that his tone indicated annoyance. "Why

take care of them both, chaperone the
daughter and look after the mother."
There was a silence. Airs. Willers be
gan to. understand why. Mr. Shackleton
had walked down toVThe Trumpet office
with her. : The walk was over, for they
were at the office door, and the conver
sation .had- reached the point he had

they parted.

Mrs.VWillers replied: / ,
"I think that would be a very good
idea, Mr. Shackleton. That is, if you
can find the right woman." ' .
"Oh, I've got her now," he answered,
giving; her a quick, "side-long . glance.
"I;thlnk it would be a good arrange

The door leading into the press rooms ;
opened , off the .-landing they: had
reached, and he turned into this .with a
pale green crape dress, with green

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL).
3(Continued Next Sunday.)
She had turned from this and was
standing by the fire when Essex en
tered. He had seen her once since her
mother's death, but she had then been
so preoccupied with grief that, with a
selfish man's hatred of all unpleasant
things, he had left her as soon as pos-~
sible. To-night he saw that she was re
covering, that, physically at least, she
was herself again. But he was struck,
almost as soon as his eye fell on her,
by a change In her. Some influence had
been at work to effect a subtile and cu
rious development in her. The simpli
city, the something childish and win
ning that had always seemed so Incon
sistent with her stately appearance,
was gone. Mariposa was coming to
herself. His heart quickened its beats
as he- realized she wa$ handsomer,
richer by some inward growth, more a
woman than she had been a month ago/
He took a seat at the other side of
the fire, and the tentative conversa
tion of commonplaces occupied them
for a few moments. The silence that
had held her In a spell of dread dejec
tion on his former visit was broken.
She seemed more than usually talka
tive. In fact, Mariposa was beginning
to feel the reaction from the life of
grief and seclusion of the last month.
She was violently ashamed of the sense
of elation that had surged up in her at
the sound of Essex's voice. She strug
gled to hide it, but it lit a light in her
eyes, called a color to her cheeks that
she could not conceal. The presence of
her lover affected herewith a sort of
embarrassed exultation that she , had
never experienced before. To hide It
she talked rapidly, looking into the fire,
to which she still held out her hands.
Essex, from the other side of the
hearth, watched her. He saw his ar
rival had made her nervous, and it only
augmented the sentiment that had been
growing in him for months. :'; ; j
She began to tell him of her move.
"I'm going to-morrow, in the after
noon. It's a queer place, an old house
on Hyde street, with a big pepper
tree, the biggest in ; the city, they say,
growing in the front garden. It was
once quite a fine house, long ago in the
early days, and was built by these peo
ple, the Garcias, when they still had
money. Then they lost it all, and now
the old ' lady and her son's wife take
"a few people, as the house is too big for
them and they are so poor. Young
Mrs. Garcia is a widow. Her husband
was killed in the mines by a blast."
To her intense surprise, Mariposa lis
tened to her with a flushed and frown
ing face of indignation.
"I won't go," she said, with sudden
violence.
"But, my dear!" expostulated Mrs.
Willers, "your whole future depends on
it. With such an influence to back you
as that, your fortune's made. And lis
ten to me, honey, for I knowâ It's not
an easy job for a woman to get on
who's alone and as good looking as you
are."
*'\ won't go," repeated Mariposa, an
gry and obstinate.
"But why not, for goodness' sake?"
in blank amaze. "What's come over
yc-u? Is it your mourning? You know
your mother's the last person v/ho'd
want you to sit indoors, moping like a
snail in a shell, when your future was
waiting for you outside the door."
Her promise rose up before Mari
posa's mental vision and checked the
angry reiteration that was on her lips.
She turned away, suddenly, tremulous
and pale.
"Don't talk about it any more." she
answered, "but I can't, go now. Per
haps later on, but not now â I can't go
now."
Mrs. Willers shrugged her shoulders,
and was wisely silent. Mariposa's grief
was making her unreasonable, that was
'all. To Shackleton she merely said that
the girt was too ill and overwrought to
see any one just yet. As soon as she
was/herself again Mrs. Willers would
bring her to The Trumpet office for the
interview that was to be the opening of
the new era. .
\ CHAPTER IX.
: HOW COULD HE?
Man Is the hunter; woman is his same.
The sletk and shining creatures of the chase.
We hunt them -for the beauty of their ekins;
They lovÂ« us for it, and we ride them down.
â Tennyson.
The month of Mariposa's tenantry of
the cottage was up. It was the last
evening" there, and she sat crouched
over a handful of fire that burned in
the front parlor grate. The room was
half empty, all the superfluous furni
ture having been taken that morning
by a Jewish , second-hand dealer. In
one'eorner stood huddled such relics as
she had chosen to keep, and which
would be borne away on the morrow to
the Garcias' boarding-house. The mar
quetry sideboard was gone. It had
been sold to a Sutter-street dealer for
$25., The red lacquer cabinet, though
no longer hers, still remained. It, too,
would be carried away to-morrow
morning by its new owners. She looked
at it with melancholy glances as fhe
fire light found and lost its golden tra
ceries and sent sudden quivering
gleams along its scarlet doors. The
fire was less a luxury than an economy,
to burn the last pieces of coal in the
.bin.
. Bending over the dancing flames,
Mariposa held her hands open to the
blaze, absently looking at their backs.'
They were fine, capable hands, large
and while, with strong wrists and a
forearm so round that its swell began
half-way between elbow and wrist
bone. Pleased by the warmth that
soothed the chill always induced by a
sojourn in the front parlor, she pulled
up her sleeves and watched the gleam
of the fire turn the white skin red. She
was sitting thus, when a ring at the bell
made her start and hurriedly push her
sleeves down. Her visitors 'were so few
that she was almost certain of the
identity of this one. For all the griefs
of'the'last month she was yet a wo
man. She sprang to her feet, and as
/the steps of the servant sounded in the
hall, ran to the large mirror in the cor
ner a^d patted and pulled her hair to
the style she thought most becoming.
niless orphan
Mariposa did not think she would
mind. In the chaotic dimness of the
dismantled front parlor she looked like
a listless goddess who would not mind
anything. :â¢-Â¦-.
Mrs. Willers' thought her state of
dreary apathy curious and spoke of it
to Shackleton, whom she now recog
nized as the girl's acknowledged guard
ian. He had listened to her account of
Mariposa's broken condition with ex
pressionless attention.
"Isn't it natural, all things consid
ered, that a girl should be broken
hearted over the death of a 'devoted
â¢mother? And,. as I understand it, Miss
Moreau is absolutely alone. She has
no relatives anywhere. It's a pretty
bleak outlook."
"That's true. I never saw a girl left
so without connections. But she wor
ries me. She's so silent, and dull, and
unlike herself. Of course. It's been a
terrible blow. I'd have thought she'd
been more prepared."
He shrugged his shoulders, stroking
his short beard with his 'lean, heavily
veined hand. . It amused him to see'the
way Mrs. Willers was quietly pushing
him into the position - of the girl's
sponsor. And at the same time it
heightened his opinion of her as a wo
man of capacity and heart. She would
be an ideal chaperone and companion
for his unprotected daughter. '
"When she feels better," he said, , "I
wish you'd bring her down here again.
Don't bother her until she feels equal
to it. , But I want to talk to. her about
Lepine's ideas for her. I saw . him
again and he gave me* a lot of informa
tion about; Paris "and teachers and all

definite arrangements I'll have to see

Mrs. Willers went back triumphantly
to Mariposa to report this conversation.
It really seemed to clinch matters. The

fortune for Mariposa Moreau, the pen-
The days that followed her mother's
funeral passed to Mariposa like a serieÂ»
of gray dreams, . dreadful, with an un*
familiar sense of wretchedness. The
preoccupation of her mother's illness
was gone. There were idle hours, when
she sat in her rooms and tried to real
ize the full meaning of Lucy's last
words. She .would sit motionless, star
ing before her, her heart feeling shriv
eled In her breast. Her life'^seemed
broken to pieces. She shrank from the
future, with the impossibilities she had
pledged herself to. And the strength
and inspiration of the beautiful past
were gone. AH the memories of that
happy childhood and young maiden
hood were blasted. It was natural that
the shock and the subsequent brooding
should make her view of the subject
morbid. The father that she . had
grown up to regard .with reverential
tenderness had not been hers. The
mother s who had been a cherished idol
had hidden a dark secret. And she,
herself, was an outsider from the home
she had so deeply lovedâ child of> a
brutal and tyrannical father â originally
adopted and cared for out of pity.
It was a crucial period in her life.
Old ideals were gone, and new ones not
yet formed. There seemed only ruins
about her, and 'amid these she sought
for something to cling to, and believe
in. With' secret passion she nursed the
thoughtifiÂ£'.Eesex^-all shp.had left that

Fortunately for her; the business calls*
of the life of " a" woman 'left penniless
shook her froni her state of brooding
idleness. The' cottage was kers for a
month longer, and despite the impover
ished condition of the widow, there was
a fair amount of furniture still left in
It that was sufficiently valuable to be a
bait to the larger dealers. Mariposa
found her days varied by contentions
with men, who came to stare at the
great red lacquer cabinet and investi
gate the interior condition of the mar
quetry sideboard. When the month
was up, she was to move to >a small
boarding-house, kept by Spaniards
called Garcia, that Mrs. Willers, In her
varying course, included among her
habitats. The Garcias would not object
to her piano and practicing, and it was
amasingly cheap. Mrs. Willers herself
had lived there in one of her periods of
eclipse, and knew- them to be respecta
ble denizens of, a somewhat battered
Bohemia. /
. ."But you're going to be a. Bohemian
yourself, being a musical genius," she
said cheerfully. "So you won't mind
that."
All morning he sat in the library,
with frowning brows, thinking. At
noon he took the train for the city and,
so<;n after its arrival, dispatched to
Mariposa the $500. He had no doubt of
her accepting it, as It never crossed his
mind that Lucy, at the last moment,
might have told.
"Poor Lucy!" said Bessie, in- a low
voice. "But they say sheAvas very*
happy with Moreau. You can do some
thing for yourâ for the girl now."
"Yes," he said; "I'll think it over. I
won't be down to breakfast. Send up
some coffee." ,
He went upstairs and locked himself
in his library. He could not understand
why the news had arcected him so
deeply. It seemed to make him feel
sick. He did not tell Bessie that he had
gone upstairs because he felt too ill
and shaken to see any one.
mentarily stung by a scornful. word.
Bessie passed him and went but on
the balcc-ny. Her husband was still
sitting on the steps, the paper in his
hand.
," "What is it. Jake?" she said. "Win
says you're cross. Something gone
wrong?" . ' i
"Lucy's dead," he answered, rising to
his feet ana handing her the paper.
She paled a little as she read the no
tice. Then, raising her eyes, they met
his. In th"ls look was their knowledge
of the secret that both had struggled to
keep, and that now, at last, was theirs.
For the second fime In a half year*,
death had stepped in and claimed one
of the four whose lives had touched so
briefly and so momentously twenty-five
years before.
He dropped the paper on his knee and
sat staring . out into the garden. The
news was more of a shock than he could
have imagined it would be. Was It the
lately roused pride In his child that had
reawakened some old tenderness for the
mother? Or was it that the thought of
Lucy, dead, called' back memories of
that shameful past?
He sat, staring, till a step on the bel
cony roused him, and turning, he saw
his son. Win, though only 23, was of
the order of beings who do not look well
in the morning. He was slightly built
and thin and had a rasped, pink ap
pearance, as though he felt cold.
Stories were abroad that Win was dis
sipated, stories, by the way, that were
largely/ manufactured by himself. He
was at that age when a reputation for
deviltry has its attractions. -.In fact, he
was amiable, gentle and . far too lack
ing in spirit to be the desperate rake
he liked to represent himself. He had a
wholesome fear of his father, whose im
patience against him was not concealed
by surface politeness as in Maud's case.
Standing with his hands in his
trousers pockets, his chest hollowed,
his red-rimmed eyqs half shut behind
the pince-nez he always wore, and his
slight mustache not sufficient to hide
a smile, thef foolishness of which rose
from embarrassment, he was not a son
to fill a father's heart with pride.
"Howdy, Governor," he said, , trying
to be easy; then, seeing the paper in his
father's hand, folded back at, the death
notices, "anybody, new born,' dead, or
married this morning?".
His voice rasped unbearably on his
father's mood. : The man gave
him a look over his shoulder, with a
face that made the boy quail. ' .
â¢ "Get away," he said, savagely; "get
in the house and leave me alone."
Win turned and entered the house.
The foolish 'smile was still on his lips.
Pride kept it there, but at heart he was
bitterly wounded.
At the foot of the stairs he met his
mother.
"You'd better not go out there," he
said, with a movement of his head in
the direction of his father; "it's as
much as your life's worth. The old
man'll bite your^ nose off If you do."
"Is your father cross?" asked Bessie.
"Cross? He oughtn't to be let loose
when he's like that."
"Something In the paper must have
upset him," said Bessie. "He was all
right this morning before he came
â¢down. Something on the stock mar
ket's bothered him." '
"Maybe so," said his son, with a cer
tain feeling. "But that's no reason why
he should speak to me like a dog. , He
goes too far when, he speaks" to me that
way. There isn't a servant in the house
would stand it."
He balanced back and forth on his
toes and heels, looking down, his face
flushed. It would have been hard to
say â such was the characterless insig
nificance of his appearanceâwhether he
was really hurt, as a. man would be in
this heart and his pride, or only mo-
threw it through the window, into the
mud of the street. She felt that her
horor of Shackleton augmented with '
every passing moment, gripped her
deeper with every memory of her
mother's words, and every moment's
perusal of the calm, dead face in its
surrounding flowers. " . - -
But her promise had been given. She
picked up .the money and put it away.
Her promise had been given. Already
she was beginning dimly to realize that
it would bind and cramp" her' for the
rest of her life. She was too benumbed
now fully to grasp its meaning, but she
felt feebly that she would be its slave
as long as he or she lived. But she had
given it.
The money lay untouched throughout
the next feu- days, Lucy's simple fu
neral ceremonies being paid for with
the proceeds of the sale of the diamond
brooch, which Moreau had given her in
the early days of theirjiappiness.
CHAPTER VIIL
IIS riPrDtl.
Flower o' the peach.
Death for us all, and hU own life for each.
â -Browning.
Jake Shackleton did not come up
from San Mateo on Monday, as Mrs.
Willers expected, and the first intima
tion he had of Lucy's death was the
short notice in the paper.
He had come down the stairs early on
Tuesday morning into the wide hall,
v.ith its doors thrown open to the fra
grant air. With the paper in his hand,
he stood in the balcony looking about
and inhaling the freshness of the morn
ing. The rain had washed the country
clean of every fleck of dust, burnished
every leaf, and had called Into being
blossoms that had been awaiting its
â¢summons.
From beneath the shade made by the
long, gnarled limbs of the live oaks, the
perfume Of the violets rose delicately,
their crowding clusters of leaves, a
clear green against the case of the
hoary trunks. The air that drifted
in from the idle, yellow fields beyond
was Impregnated with the breath of,
the tar weed â one of the most pungent
and impassioned odors nature has man
ufactured in her vast laboratory, char
acteristic scent to rise from the dry, yet
fecund grass lands of California. In
the perfect, crystalline stillness these
mingled perfumes rose like incense to
the new day.
Shackleton looked about him, the
paper in his" hand. He had little love
for nature, but the tranquil-scented
freshness of the hour wrung its tribute
of admiration from him. What an
irony that the one child he had, worth
having gained all this for, should be
denied it. Mariposa, thus framed,
would have added the last touch to the
triumphs of his life.
With an explanation of impatience he
sat down on the top step, and opening;
the paper, ran his glance down its col
umns. He had been looking over it for
several minutes before the death notice
of Lucy struck his eye.,~It~took : awayl
.his bfeath. He read it again, a.t first
not crediting it. He. was entirely un
prepared, having merely thought of
Lucy as "delicate." Now she was dead.'
"I've thought," his deep voice went
on, "that you cared for me â a little.
I've watched, I've desponded. But
latelyâ lately â " he leaned toward her
and lowered his voice â "I've hoped."
She still made no answer. It seemed
to her none was necessary or possible. ,
"Do you care?" he said, softly. I
She breathed a "yes" that only the
ear of love could have heard.
"Mariposa, dearest, do you mean it?"
He leaned over her and laid his han'd on
hers v His voice was husky and his
hand trembling. To the extent that
was in him he loved this woman.
"Do you love me?" he. whispered.
The "yes" was even fainter this time.
He raised the hand he held to his
breast and tried to draw her into his
arms.
She resisted, and turned on him a
pale face, where emotions, never stirred
before, were quivering. She was moved
to the bottom of her soul. Something
in her face made him shrink a little.
With her hand against his breast she
gave him the beautiful look of a wo
man's first sense of her surrender. He
stifled the sudden twinge of his con
science and again tried to draw her
close to him. But she held him off with
the hand on his breast and said â aa
thousands of girls say every year:
"Do you really love me?'*
"More than the whole world," he an
swered glibly, but with the roughened
voice of real feeling.
"Why?" she said with a tremulous
smile, "why should you?"
"Because you are you."
"But I'm just a small Insignificant
person here, without any relations, and
poor, so poor."
"Those things don't matter when a
man loves a woman. It's you I want,
not anything you might have or might
be."
"But you're so clever and have lived
everywhere and seen everything, and
I'm so-^so countrified and stupid."
"You're Mariposa. That's enough for
me."
"All I can bring you for my portion
Is my heart."
"And that's all I want."
"You love me enough to marry me?"
His eyes that had been looking ar
dently into her face, shifted.
"I love you enough to be a fool about
you. Does that please you?"
Her murmured answer was lost In the
first kiss of love that had ever been
pressed on her lips. She drew back
from it, pale and thrilled, not abashed,
but looking at her lover with eyes be
fore which his drooped. It was a sa
cred moment to her.
"How wonderful," she* whispered,
"that you should care for me."
"It would be more wonderful If I
hadn't." â
"And that you came now, when
everything was so dark and lonely.
You don't know how horribly lonely I
felt this evening, thinking of leaving
here to-morrow and going among
strangers." . !
That quivering pause which falls be
twejen a man and woman when the
words that will link or sever them for
life are to be spoken, held the room.
Mariposa felt the terrified desire to ar
rest-the coming words that is the
maiden's last instinctive stand for her
liberty. But her brain was confused,
and her heart beat like a hammer.
"With me," Essex repeated, as the
pause grew unbearable. "Is there no
happiness for you in that thought?"
She made no answer, and suddenly he
moved his chair close to her side. She
felt his eyes fastened on her and kept
hers on the fire. Her other offers of
marriage had not been accomplished
with this stifling sense of discomfort.
"It's â It'sâ rather a dilapidated sort
of . place," she continued after a mo
ment's pause, "but perhaps I'll get used
to it."
There was distinct pleading for con
firmation in this. Her voice was slight
ly husky. Essex, however, with that
perversity which marked all his treat
ment of her, said:
"Do you think you will? It's difficult
for a woman to accommodate herself to
such changed conditions â I mean a wo
man of refinement, like you. "
She continued feebly to make her
stand.
"But my conditions have changed so
much in the last two or three years. 1
ought to be used to it; it's not as if it
was the first time. Before my father
got sick we were so comfortable. We
were rich and had quantities of beau
tiful things like that cabinet. And as
they have gone, one by one, so we have
come down bit by bit, till I am left like
this."
She made a gesture to include the
empty room and turned back to the fire.
"But you won't stay like this," he
said, throwing a glance over the bare
walls.
"Don't you think so?" she said, look
ing into the fire with dejected eyes.
"You're kind to try to cheer me up."
"You can be happy, protected and
cared for. with your life full of sun
shine and joyâ"
He stopped. Every step he took was
of moment, and he was not the type of
man to forgive himself a mistake.
Mariposa was looking at him, frowning
slightly.
"How do you mean?" she said.
"With my voice?"
"No," he answered, in a tone that
suddenly thrilled with meaning, "with
me."
"It sounds picturesque. Do they
speak English?"
"The senora. that's the old lady,
doesn't. ' She has lived here since before
the Gringo came, but she can't speak
any English at all. The daughter-in
law is an American, a Southerner. She
looked very untidy the day I went
there. I'm afraid I'll be homesick.
You'll come to see me sometimes, won't
you?"
There was no coquetry in the remark.
Her dread of loneliness was all that
spoke.
Ess.t-x met her eyes, dark and wist
ful, and nodded without speaking.
She looked back at the fire and again
spread her hands to it, palms out.
With a spring Mariposa snatched the
drooping body in her arms and cried
into the face, settling into cold rigidity:
"Yes â yes â I promise! All â anything.
Oh, mother, darling, look at me. I
promise."
She gently shook the limp form,* but
it was nerveless, only the head oscil
lated slightly from side to side.
"Mother, look at me," she cried fran
tically. "Look at me, not past me."
Come back to me. Speak to me, I
promise everything."
But there was no response. Lucy
lay, limp and white-lipped, her head
lolling back from the support of her
daughter's arm. Her strength was ez
hausted to the last drop. She was un
conscious.
The wild figure of Mariposa at the
kitchen door summoned Mrs. Brown.
Lucy was not dead, but dying. A few
moments later Mariposa found herself
rushing hatless through the rain for the
doctor, and then again, in what seemed
a few more minutes, standing soaked
and breathless, by her mother's side.
She sat there throughout the night,
holding the limp hand and watching
for a glimmer of consciousness in the
half-shut eyes.
It never came. There was no rally
from the collapse which followed the
mother's confession. She had lived till
this was done. Then, having accom
plished the great action of her life, she
had loosed her hold and let go. Once,
Mrs. Brown being absent, Mariposa had
leaned down on the pillow and pas
sionately reiterated the assurance that
she would give the promise Lucy hed
asked. There was a slight quiver of
animation in the dying woman's face
and she opened her eyes as if startled,
but made no other sign of having heard
or understood. But Mariposa knew
that she had promised.
On the evening of the day after her
confession Lucy died, slipping away
quietly as if in sleep. The death of the
simple and unknown lady made no rip
ple on the surface of the city's life.
Mrs. Willers and a neighbor or two
were Mariposa's sole visitors, and the
only flowers contributed to Lucy's
coffin were those sent by the news
paper woman and Barry Essex. The
afternoon . of the day on which her
mother's death was announced, Mari
posa received a package from Jake
Shackleton. With it came a short note
of condolence, and the offer, kindly
and simply worded, of the small sum
of money contained in the package,
which, it was hoped, Miss Moreau, for
the sake of the writer's early acquaint
ance with her parents and Interest in
herself, would accept. The packet con
tained 1500 in coin.
Mariposa's face flamed. The money
fell through her fingers and rolled
about on the floor. She would have
liked to take it, piece by piece, and
Her voice suddenly hesitated and
broke. A gray pallor ran over her face
and a look of terror transfixed her eyes.
She straightened her arms out toward
her daughter.
"Promise," she gasped, "promise."
"Don't blame him, dear; the past is
over. Forgive him. Forgive me. If I
sinned there were excuses for me. ' I
had suffered too much. I loved too
well."
"Oh, mother, don't ask me. What
have you just told me? That he sold
you to a stranger for a pair of horses,
left you to die in a cabin in the moun
tains! That's not my father. My father
was Dan Moreau. I can do nothing
but hate that other man now."
"Oh, that beautiful winter! There is
a God, to be so good to women who
have suffered as I had."
Mariposa sat dumbly regarding her.
It was like a frightful nightmare.
Everything was strange, the sickroom,
the bed with the screen around it, her
mother's face with its hollow eyes and
pinched nose. Only the two old dirty
papers on the white counterpane
seemed to say that this was real.
Lucy's eyes, which had been looking
back into that glorified past of love and
youth, returned to her daughter's face.
"But Jake is your father," she said.
"That's what I had to tell you. He'll
be good to you. That was why he
wanted to find you and help you."
"Yes," said llariposa, dully, "I un
derstand that now; that was why ht
wanted to help me."
"He'll be good to you," went on the
low, weak voice, interrupted by quick
breaths. "I know Jake. He'll be
proud of you. You're handsome and
talented, not weak and poor spirited,
as I was. You're his only legitimate
child; the others are not; they were
born in California, They're Bessie's
children, and I was his only real wife.
You'll let him take care of you? Oh,
Mariposa, my darling, I've told you all
this that you might understand and let
him take care of you."
She made a last call on her strength
and leaned forward. Her dying bo&y
was revivified; all her mother's agony
of love appeared on her face. In de
termining to destroy the illusions of
her child to secure her future, she had
made the one heroic^ effort of her life.
It was done, and for a last moment of
relief and triumph she was thrijlingly.
alive.
Maripsoa, in a spasm of despair,
threw herself forward on the bed.
"Oh, why did you tell me? Why did
you tell me?" she cried. "Why didn't
you let me think it was the way it used
to be? Why did you tell me?"
Lucy laid her hand on the bowed
head.
"Because I wanted you to understand
and let him be your- father."
"My father! That man! Oh, no, no!"
"You must promise me. Oh, my be
loved child, I couldn't leave you alone.
It seemed as if God had said to me,
'Die* In peace. â¢ Her father will care for
her.' I couldn't go and leave you this
way, without a friend. Now I can rest
in peace. Promise to let him take care
of you. promise."
She stopped, a look of ineffable sweet
ness passed over her face, and she said
in a low* voice, as if speaking to her
self:
In all winter, and we lived as man and
wife. In the spring we rode into Hang
town and were married."

kitchen and set her dinner. The wo
man rose with alacrity, and asking
Mariposa to call her If the invalid
showed signs erf fatigue, or any change,
Jeft the room.
The girl turned back to the bedside
and took the chair. Lucy had taken
from the dirty envelope a worn and
faded paper, which she slowly unfolded.
As she did so, she looked at her daugh
ter with sunken eyes and said:
â¢â¢These are my marriage certificates."
Mariposa, again thinking that her
mind Â¦ was wandering, tried to smile,
and answered gently:
â¢Tour marriage certificate, dear. You
were only married once."
"I was married twice." said Lucy,
and handed the girl the two papers.
Still supposing her mother slightly
delirious, the daughter took the papers
and looked at them. The one her eye
first fell on was that of the original
marriage. She read the names with
out at first realizing whose they were.
Then the significance of the "Lucy Fra
â¢?er' came upon her. Her glance leaped
to the second paper, and at the first
sweep of her eyes over It she saw it
was the marriage certificate of her
father and mother, Daniel Moreau and
Lucy Fraser, dated at Placerville twen
ty-five years before. She turned back
to the other paper, now more than be
wildered. She held it near her face, as
though it were difficult to read, and in
the dead silence of the room it began
to rustle with the trembling of her
hand. A fear of something hideous and
overwhelming seized her. With pale
lips she read the names, and the date,
antedating by five years the other cer
tificate.
"Mother!" she cried, in a wild voice
of Inquiry, dropping the paper on the
bed.
Lucy, raised on her pillows, was look
ing at her with a haggard intentness.
All the vitality left in her expiring body
seemed concentrated in her eyes.
"I was married twice," she said slow
l.v-
"But how? When? What does it
mean? "Mother, what does it mean?"
"I was married twice," she repeated.
"In St. Louis to Jake Shackleton, and
in Placerville, five years after, to Dan
Moreau. And I was never divorced
from Jake. It was not according to the
law. I was never Dan's lawful wife."
The girl sat staring, the meaning of
the words slowly penetrating her brain.
She was too stunned to speak. Her
face was as white as her mother's. For
a tragic moment these two white faces
looked at each other. The mother's,
with death waiting to claim her, was
void of all stress or emotion. The
daughter's waking to life was rigid
with horrified amaze.
Propped by her pillows, Lucy spoke
again; her sentences were short and
with pauses between:
"Jake Shackleton married me in St.
Louis when I was 15. He was soon
tired of me. We went to Salt Lake
City. He became a Mormon there, and
took a second wife. She was a waitress
in a hotel. She's his wife now. He
brought us both to California twenty
five years ago. On the way across, on
the plains of Utah, you were born. He
is your father, Mariposa."
She made an effort and sat up. Her
breathing was becoming difficult, but
her purpose gave her strength. This
was the information fhat for weeks she
.had been nerving herself to impart.
! "He is your father," she repeated.
"That's what I wanted to tell you."
Mariposa made no answer, and again
she repeated:
"He is your father. Do you under
stand? Answer me."
"Yesâ I don't know. Oh, mother, it's
so strange and horrible. And you sit
ting there and looking at me like that,
and telling it to me! Oh. mother! "
She put her hands over her face f .r
an instant, and then dropping them,
leaned over on the bed and grasped her
mother's wrists.
"You're wandering in your mind. It's
just some hideous dream you've had in
your fever. Dearest, tell me it's not
true. It can't be true. Why, think of
you and me and father always together
and with no dreadful secret behind us
like that. Ohâ it can't be true!"
Lucy looked at the papers lying
brown and torn on the white quilt.
Mariposa's eyes followed the same di
rection, and with a groan her head
sank on her arms extended along the
bed. Her mother's hand, cold and
light, was laid on one of hers, but the
dying woman's face was held in Its
quiet, unstirred apathy, as she spoke
again:
"Jake was hard to me on the trip.
He was a hard man and he never loved
me. After Bessie came he got to dis
like me. I was always a drag, he said.
I couldn't seem to get well after you
were born. Coming over the Sierras we
stopped at a cabin- Dan was there
with another man, a miner, called
Fletcher. That was the first time I
ever saw Dan."
Mariposa lifted her head and her eyes
fastened on her mother's face. The in
difference that had held it seemed
breaking. A faint smile was on her
lips, a light of reminiscence lit its gray
pallor.
"He was always good to anything
that was sick or weak. He was sorry
for me. He tried to make Jake stop
longer, so I could get rested. But Jake
wouldn't. He said I had to go on. I
couldn't, but knew I must, If he said
it. We were going to start when Jake
said he'd exchange me for the pair of
horses the two miners had in the shed.
So he left me and took the horses."
"Exchanged you for the horses? Left
you there sick and alone?"
"Yes, Jake and Bessie went on with
the horses. I stayed. I was too sick
to care."
She made a slight pause, either from
weakness, or in an effort to arrange
the next part of her story.
"I lived there with them for a month.
I was sick and they took care of me.
Then one day - Fletcher stole all the
money and the only horse and never
came back- We were alone there then,
Dan and L I got better. I came to love

Whether the people would give as

WHAT THE LOCAL RED CROSS IS DOING
of strange, pathetic echoes. In the
summer of 1865 she went to Ander
sonville under instructions from â¢ the
Secretary of War for the purposa of
identifying the Â£ead and laying out
the first national cemetery. Four years
of incessant work followed, devoted ex
clusively to searching for missing men
who had been killed, and of whom no
trace could be found upon the Govern
ment records, and the result of her in
vestigation was that eighty thousand
missing men were added to the rec
ords.
A total collapse at tha end of this
arduous work necessitated a rest and
change of scene, and she was ordered
to Europe, where she came in contact
with the Red 'Cross and its work for
the first time. And here the history of
the Red Cross in relation to this coun
try may be said to commence. The
fame of her war record and the stu
pendous work she had just completed
were fresh in the minds of European
philanthropists when she arrived in
Geneva, where the Red Cross . Society
had originated ' some years before.
She was waited upon by, the Presi
dent 'of the little republic and the
members of the International commit
tee for the . relief of the wounded in
close a hint of aught that might
frighten or chill the blood. Her po
sition in this matter Miss Barton ex
plained.
"To relate a painful Incident, or to
depict a scene of horror, whether that
horror be physical or moral, always
seemed revolting to me. Besides, it is
useless. It only arouses the latent
morbidity of the public and does little
toward arousing sympathy and help."
Miss Barton would talk freely, how
ever, about the Red Cross and, its
work, and in her clear, steady, rich
voice and with. a soft light shining in
her fine old eyes â eyes that are large
and clear and hazel in color â she
touched briefly upon the events of her
early life until she became associated
with the movement.
She told of the childhood spent in
her native New England, of starting
out to teach school at the age of 13,
and of her entry into Washington
some years later to nil the first Gov
ernmental department position ever
given to a woman by the United
States. One memorable morning word
came to her as she was working in
her department that the Sixth Massa
chusetts regiment had been attacked
in the streets of Baltimore on its way
to the front. She instantly dropped
her -work and stepped boldly out into
the' stream that was to bear her into
the vortex of the Civil War.
The career of Clara Barton during
this period forms a brilliant page of
the history of American womanhood.
At any Grand Army post in the coun
try one may gather moving lines of it,
told by veterans In strange voices, full
in the cause which has made her name
and fame world wfde. On the wall are
the photographs of great historic scenes
in which she has played her gentle
part of ministering angel to the suf
fering and afflictedâ line drawings and
old-fashioned engravings showing her
on the battlefields of Antietam, Peters
burg, the Wilderness and others of the
terrible scenes of carnage through
which she passed in her four years'
continuous service during the Civil
War.
There are reminiscent pictures of the
Franco-German war of a few years
laterâ Hagenau, Metz, Strasburg and
the fall of the Commune, when she led
the first hospital relief into the van
quished city of Paris. There are scenes
of the Johnstown disaster, of the Michi
gan forest firep, of yellow fever epi
demics, the South Sea Islands hurri
cane, the Armenian massacres and of
the recent Spanish-American War.
There are the inscribed photos of
kings and queens and royal princes and
princesses of a half dozen different na
tions, to whose subjects Miss Barton
has some time or other rendered ser
vice.
Of herself it is almost impossible to
induce Miss Barton to talk, save in
the most impersonal way and upon
the most trifling incidents in her ca
reer. Of her actual experiences, in the
field it is proverbial that no man or
woman has ever heard her relate a
single concrete incident of all the
numberless frightful and highly sen
sational episodes to which she has
been an eyewitness: nor can the most
persistent friend persuade her to dis-
war. They wished to learn why the
United States had declined to sign the
treaty of Geneva, which provided that
all wounded and sick soldiers and all
surgeons and nurses attending them,
. all hospitals and supplies for their con
sumption, should be held neutral and
Â¦ sacred by both armies. 1
r - . â¢
This treaty, upon which the Red
Cross Society was founded, had twice
been formally presented to the Gov
ernment at Washington, in 1864 and in
186S, and had been rejected In both in
stances, and no satisfactory or ade
quate reason had been given by the
nation for the course pursued.
Miss Barton immediately set about
to study the Red Cross Idea in all its
details, with a view to urging our
Government to action immediately
upon her return. While she was en
gaged in her labors France declared
war against Prussia. This was in 1S70,
and within three days Miss Barton,
still broken in' health, had stepped Into
the ranks of the Red Cross and was
en route to the scene of war to take
up the .same work she had performed
in the Civil War.
In all the great battles of this .bloody
war sht took a leading part in caring
for the sick and wounded. She worked
in Paris through the winter of the siege
and through all the horrors ofc the com
mune, and at the close of the war, after
King William of Germany had been
proclaimed Emperor in the palace at
Versailles, she organized a complete
system of relief camps throughout the
distressed cities of France.
Her reputation had now become world
wide, and when she returned in 1873
she not only brought back an Intimate
knowledge of the Red Cross, but she
hadteen decorated with the Iron Cross
of Prussia, bestowed by Emperor 'Wil
liam and Express Augusta, and the
Gold Cross of Remembrance from the
Grand Duke and Duchess of Baden.
Her European work she had passed
over to the central committee of Ge
neva and to the rulers of European na
tions in order to devote herself to the
organization of a similar society in this
country. After > five years* work she
succeeded in getting Congress and the
United States executive forces to listen
to her appeal and permit this country
to become signatory to the treaty of
Geneva.

should have taken a humane and
Christian land so long to make up its
mind upon a subject so universally -ap-

The particular house in which Miss
Barton lives and works flies the well
known rted Cross flag, and it was here
I ?ou::d her one day last week sittting
at a desk piled hicb with correspond
ence. I arrived Just in time to see two
young women retire with so/newhat
disappointed faces. When the door had
closed behind them Miss Barton
spoke.
"Poor sirls! They wanted me to take
them to Japan with me as Red Cross
nurses." There was a tone of dry good
humor in the rich, deep voice, and a
suggestion of suppressed merriment
played about the fine, tender, sympa
thetic mouth, which, next to her eyes,
it Miss Barton's most characteristic
feature. It is a large, mobile mouth,
and its lips are transversed with deli
cate little wrinkles which Impress one
with the delightful sense of owing their
origin not to Miss Barton's seventy-five
busy. care-la<!en years, but to an old
fashioned sense of decorum which for
bids her giving full expression to a
keen sense of the humorous and ridic
ulous.
In each one of those thousand little
vrinkles one seems to read the con
sciousness, the eyewitness of a funny
incident happening in the midst of grim
tragedy and under circumstances where
it would have been little short of sac
rilege to laugh, even to smile. Miss
Barton pointed to the piled up letters
on her desk, and the tremulous smile
Â¦was row no longer repressed.
"Poor girls! Every one of them wants
to go with me to Japan. They seem
to think I am recruiting an army of
nurses, ar.d they take it as a matter
of course that I shall invade Japan.
It has been the same in every war.
The Red Cross appears to these foolish
young women as offering an excellent
opportunity to get away from home
and go- in quest of strange adventures.
As a matter of fact, I doubt very much
whether Japan will have any need of
the Red Cross during the present war.
They have one of the finest Red Cross
societies in the world, and there are
no women in the world better fitted
as nurses than the Japanese women.
They have a natural tenderness, a gen
tleness, a skill in such matters which
perhaps exceed those of most other
nations.
"The only contingency in which it
would be possible that the Red Cross
would go to Japan would be in case
she Japanese resources would not prove
sufficient in numbers. In such event,
of course, the Red Cross of America,
will offer immediate assistance/just as
tbn :*..d Cross societies of the other na
tions will all come to lend a helping
hand." *
The room where we were sitting was
rrivate office and fitting-room com
bined. Clara Barton's innermost shrine
and sanctum, and within Its four walls
were the trophies and memoirs of more
than forty-three years of active service
pealing to the heart and conscience of
mankind." said Miss Barton. "It seems
to.be the fate of every humanitarian
movement to meet at first an incom
prehensible opposition. In this respect
the Red Cross Inovement shared scarce
ly- less indifference and contempt than
had the abolitionist movement some
years before.
"To-day wherever in the world there
is need of aid |n time of war the Red
Cross Society of America is ready at a
few hours' notice to dispatch supplies
and nurses to aid its sister societies
wherever they may be laboring, wheth
er in Japanese or Russian territory,
and no matter where we may be needed
we are sure of safe and speedy escort
through the enemies' lines.
"The Red Cross kneva no friend, no
foe. It docs not recognize the word
enemy, and, thanks to the treaty of
Geneva as well as to the popular senti
ment of all the nations, it is regarded
as a strictly neutral body, with full
power to go whither it sees fit.
"As things look, it seems as if Russia
is to have a lens and bloody war with
Japan, anil it is difficult for the aver
age newspaper reader to realize how
vastly the hospital field service has
been improved since the days, for in
stance, of our Civil War. To-day no
'Jap,' no Cossack will lie uncared for
on the battlefield nor unfed in the hos
pital camp. It is hard for any one to
realize the strides in the humane con
duct of war since the days of the Pe
ninsula in McClcllan's campaign, of
Pittsburg Landing, Cedar Mountain,
Second Bull Run. Antictam and ter
rible old Fredericksburg, with its acres
of snow covered fields and its fourth
day flag of truce; of its dead and starv
ing wounded frozen to the ground and
our commissions and their supplies in
Washington, with no effective organ
ization to go beyond; of the Petersburg
mine, with its 4000 dead and wounded
and no flag of truce, the wounded
broiling in a July sun, and then dying
and rotting where .they fell.
"I remember our prisons â Libby, An
dersonville and others, all crowded with
starving men, whom all the powers
and pities of the world could not reach,
even with a bit of bread. The Red
Cross exists to-day, not because there
has ever been conscious lack of indi
vidual kindness in times of war and
distress, but because there has been
and always is a lack of system govern
ing individual charity. Without sys
tem individual efforts in anything
count for very little."
As Miss Barton talks one become3
impressed with the consciousness that
she is a veritable stickler for system
and order, even into the minute details
of everyday life and conduct. There
is pleasing precision about her trim,
spare little figure and neatness shim
mers from the very texture of her
black satin gown. She was dressed for
an afternoon call which was to be
made later In the day, which fact ac
counted for the satin gown and the
splendid amethyst brooch worn at the
throat, a gift from her long time Inti
mate friend, the Grand Duchess of
Baden.
On the table, scattered among the
photographs of princes and prin
cesses, were a few books â old-fash
ioned poets and two modern novels.
"Are you a great reader. Miss Bar
ton?" I asked, expecting the usual
conventional appreciations and one or
two overpowering enthusiasms.
"Xo," replied the lady, decidedly.
"I am not a great reader. 1 don't
read much of anything."
"You are too busy now, of course,
but you have read much in the past?"
and the question was sincere, for in
desultory conversation Miss Barton
seems to be tinctured with the litera
tures of all the lands. The insistence
upon the subject did not meet with a
cordial reception, however, and she
shook her head impatiently.
"No, I do not read much now, and
I never have read a great deal â that
is, judged by the way the people of to
day devour books. Reading in my
young days was a sort of recreation,
although it could be hardly called a
fashionable recreation. There weren't
so many books to read, and there was
not nearly so much time to read them.
Perhaps I might have read more had
I not been so busy all my lite I must
confess, though, that books are not
much to my taste, not much more
than theology is."
Again Miss Barton's delicate little
wrinkles began to show signs of sup
pressed merriment.
"You are not a church woman, then,
although you did come from New Ens
land?"
' "No, I am simply a well disposed
pagan."
"You will probably be a Japanese
sympathizer, then?"
Miss Barton shot a humorous flash
across the table toward a particular
picture, which showed her standing
side by side with a fierce admiral in
full dress uniform.
"Oh, no," said she. "I love the Rus
sians, and I could not take sides against
them, even If the Red Cross were not
an avowedly neutral body. The Rus
sians I have found to be the tenderest
hearted people in the world, especially
the Russian soldiers, and I have met
a great many of them. Why, the last
time I was in St. Petersburg I stood
up and had my picture taken along
side of Admiral Kosmokofl.'and there
it is."
Reposing: in no greater security than
that offered by a bureau drawer Miss
Barton has a collection of jewels that
would make a society queen envious,
each and every one of them a token
from the royalty of the Old World.
There are splendid bracelets, and
pearl and topaz brooches from Prus
sian princesses, innumerable gems from
the Duchess of Baden, a solid gold
liqueur service, richly inlaid with rare
enamel, from the Tsar himself; silver
and gold medals innumerable; old and
rare jewels from the old Emperor
William's Queen, and countless honor
ary decorations, the most important of
which are the Iron Cross of Prussia
and the Order of the Red Cross from

In "A Lamb to the Â¦ Slaughter" Lee
Welling Squier has also broken away
from well-beaten paths of fiction and
laid his scene, in Japan, Korea and
China. He does not, however, deal With
Oriental characters, but, like Kipling,
he writes of Caucasians in Oriental sur
roundings. His characters are the mis
sionaries and his problems ; the grave
ones "which confront a beautiful.con
secration and zealous effort to supplant
the oldest extant civilization and j re
ligion by the newest." . r
The author has succeeded in writing
an" Interesting story, that ably , deplctB
all the phases of European life in the
Far East. Throughout Incidents of
th*> book the shows that his knowledge
of life and especially of missionary life
in' the oldest stronghold of Buddha is
deriveii. at first hand. Though, he does
not acknowledge that to his eyes many
of the efforts of these worthy people are
vain, Scfuier succeeds in giving, to. the
Christian world a convincing conception

creed . . _ . . :

THERE could be found no better in
dication of the widespread interest"
attached to affairs as they now are
in the Far East than the haste which
all of the publishers have exerted in
bringing out any book bearing upon
Japan, China, Korea or Asiatic Russia.
Besides reprinted works and newly
written books of travel and of affairs
in the Orient enterprising publishers
have seized the auspicious moment to
launch also new works of fiction whose
scenes present the alluring paddy*flelds
and ragged mountains of the much dis
traught Korea or Manchuria. Within
the last few weeks "The Queen of Quel
parte," a novel of Korea by Arthur
Butler Hulbert, and "A Lamb to the
Slaughter," likewise a tale of Korea
and China, by Lee Welling Squier, have
come from the presses. Both of the
books will be bought if only for their
pertinency.
But "The Queen of Quelparte" has
more claims on the attention of the
reading world than that of mere time
liness. It is a book of thrilling adven
ture and breathless interest' far , and
away above the ordinary standard of
such novels of action. With the scene
laid in Korea, the Eastern unknown
land with all of its Oriental mysticism
and wealth of barbaric, tradition, the
author has been able to drop over his
whole story the charmed mantle of
mystery â the. mystery of the unknown.
Not only that, but he has so skillfully
reproduced the clash between the thor
oughly intrenched conservatism and
reticence of the Oriental mind and the
grasping, -belligerent Intrusion of the
Western idea, exemplified" in the on
ward march of. the Russian, that his
story is a perfect miniature. of the strife
which has been waged and is now wag
ing for the mastery over the oldest
nations in the world. ~

Ainslee's for March opens with a.
novelette which takes the shape of
autographlcal notes by a society girl
which tells of her experiences from the \
time she was 15 years of age to the
time of her engagement. It is original
and dramatic and, what is more Im
portant, interesting. It Is called "Miss

his characteristic tales called "Five

Mammon, like so many of his success

seem that his last book, "Denis Dent,"
wag written hurriedly in answer. to the
persistent call of his publisher. It is
a distinct falling off. from the genius
which' Mr. Hornung' has manifested in
his previous- stories.
The scene of the early part of the

I This ,'j plot could v scarcefy be called
anything, but hackneyed. The big,
strong hero who is willing to move the
world for his lady love 'has figured In
fiction almost since men, marked their
thoughts upon walrus tusks and so
does not gain any distinction by new
handling from the -peri of Mr. Harming.
The one thing that does mark the story
"as original is the very vivid and Bret-

will attach to the artiqle entitled "Will
Roosevelt Share the Fate of Arthur?"
by Charles M. Harvey, in which the
remarkable, similarities and contrasts
between the campaigns of 1884 and 1904
are pointed out very forcefully. "The
Labor Truce in New York," by William
English Walling, makes â¢ known the
true inwardness of the labor situation
there and the basis of agreement and
present harmony. Politics under the
'control of the machine receive drastic
exposition from Francis W. Parker of
the Illinois Senate, who distinguishes
between "The Machine or A Ma
chine." W. T. Stead scores British
army officials for unnecessarily provok

further to its well-established
reputation as a torch bearer m

nation's dark places greatly to the in

dark page in Kentucky's history.
There is a mine of fiction from which
there is to be extracted riches for all.
Anthony Hope, in his strongest roman

This expression of idealistic monothe

The story of the struggle between his
instinctive loyalty to the creed of his
fathers and the callings of Heine and
the gnostics is a moving one.
This story of the struggles of his
soul Is only subsidiary, however, to
Brudno's tale of his life battle. Born
in a little village of Lithuania, the hero
of the story sees his father falsely im
prisoned and done to death and his
mother removed from him by fatal Ill
ness while he is yet scarcely more than
an infant. Thrown out upon the world,
the hapless little wretch is forced to eat
the meager loaf of charity while lie is
subjected to the brutality of Jewish
taskmasters at the Talmud-Torah, or
village private school. Brow-beaten by
his master and bullied by his com
rades, the starved drudge has to worry
along with the Talmud until a fire
sweeps away the homes of his benefac
tors and he is thrown upon the barren
mercies of the forest. A Russian Judge
befriends him for a time, and he lives
a little dream of happiness until the in
fant love between the stripling boy and
Katia. the Judge's daughter, brings to
the fort the father's race prejudice,
and again the wanderer is out in the
world.

"Dave*! -'Dave!" she cried. "I will not

"I suppose not. But tell m e about

"I did have some," he replied. "Mis

men, but they went down to El Dorado
to work at wages for a grubstake."
Mrs. Sayther cast a look of specula

course, there are plenty of Indians
about?"
"Every mother's son of them down to
Dawson long ago. Not a native in the
whole cbuntry, barring- Winapie here,
and she's a Koyokuk lassâ comes from
a thousand miles or so down the river."
Mrs. Sayther felt suddenly faint, and
though the smile of interest in no wise
waned, the . face of the man seemed to
draw away to a telescopic distance and
the tiered logs of the cabin , to whirl
drunkenly about. .

lay down to wait in comfort.

on. "In the, last letter, which you did

"But it is not." She was at his side
again, her hand touching lightly, ca
ressingly, the sunburned back of his.
"No. no," he protested. "It is not
right."
"Come, Dave, you must see. She is
not your kind. There is no race affin
ity. She is an aborigine, sprung from
the soil, yet close to the soil, and Im
possible to lift from the soil. Born
savage, savage she will die. But weâ
you and Iâ the dominant, evolved race â

you cannot deny. You cannot escape

stronger than the will. The. race is
mightier than you. Come. Dave, let us
go. We are young yet, and life is good.
Come."
Winapie, passing out of the cabin to
feed the dogs, caught his attention and
caused him to shake his head and
weakly to reiterate. But the woman's
hand slipped about his neck, and her
cheek pressed to his. His bleak life
rose up and smote himâ the vain strug
gle with pitiless forces; the dreary
years of frost and famine; the harsh
and jarring contact with elemental life;,
the aching void which mere animal ex
istence could not fill. â¢
"Come. Dave, come. I have, for both.
The way is soft." She looked 'about her
t at the bare furnishings of the cabin.
"I have for both. The world is at our
feet, and all joy is ours. Come! come!"
She was in his arms, trembling, and
he held her tightly. He rose to , his
feet. * * * But the snarling of hun
gry dogs and the shrill cries of Winapie
bringing about peace between the com
batants came muffled to his ear through
the heavy logs. And another scene
flashed before him. A struggle in the
forestâ a bald-face grizzly, broken-leg
ged, : terrible; the snarling of the dogs
and the shrill cries of Winapie as she
urged them to. the attack; himself in
the midst of the crush, breathless,
panting, striving to hold off red death;
broken- backed, ehtrall-ripped . dogs
h' ./ling in impotent anguish and dese
crating the snow; the virgin white run

beast; â¢ the bear, ferocious, irresistible,
crunching, crunching down to the core
of his life, and Winapie at the last, in
the thick of the frightful muddle, hair
"I am not a girl, Dave, with a girl's
illusions," she said, softly, though not
daring to ccme back to him. "It is as

to start out against a background of
utter black, and the flame, flaring sud
denly up, lighted her bronze beauty to
royal gold.
"You see, it is impossible," he groan
ed, thrusting the fair-haired woman
gently from him. "It Is impossible."
he repeated. "It is impossible."
Coolly she thrust out a brown fore
finger and pressed the soft cheek of
Karen Sayther. And to the eternal
credit of the woman, she never flinched.
Pierre hesitated and half stepped for
ward; but she motioned him away
though her heart welled to- him with
secret gratitude. "It's all right, Pierre,"
she said. "Please go away."
He stepped back respectfully out of
earshot, where he stood grumbling to
himself and measuring the distance in
springs.
"Urn white, um softy, like baby."
Winapie touched the other cheek and
withdrew her hand. "Bimeby mosquito

Plenty mosquito; plenty spot. I think
better you go now before mosquito

stream, "you go St. Michael's; that
way," pointing up, "you go> Dyea. Bet

And that which Mrs. Sayther then
did caused Pierre to marvel greatly.
For she threw her arms around the
Indian girl, kissed her and burst into
tears.
"Be good to him," she cried. "Be
good to him." Â¦''.
Then she slipped half down the face
of the bank, called back, "Good-by,"
and dropped* into the boat amidships.
Pierre followed- her and cast off. He
shoved the steering oar into place and
gave the signal. Le Goire lifted an old
French chanson; the men, like a row
of ghosts in the dim starlight, bent
their backs to the tow line; the steering
oar cut the black current sharply, and
the boat swept out into the night.

extraordinary command as though it
were the most usual thing in the world.
Â» "Which way? Dawson?" :
"No," she answered, lightly enough.
"Upâ outâ Dyea."
Mrs. Sayther waited till the luggage
was made shipshape and her nest pre
pared.
"We line up to de head of de island."
Pierre explained to her while running
out the long tow rope. "Den we tak to
das back channel where de water not

A scuffling and pattering of feet in the
last year's dry grass caught his quick
ear, and he turned his head. The In
dian girl, circled by a bristling ring of
wolf dogs, was coming toward them.
Mrs. Sayther noted that -the girl's face,
which had been apathetic throughout
the scene in the cabin, had now quick
ened into blazing and wrathful life.
"What you do my man?" she de
manded abruptly of Mrs. Sayther.
"Him lay on bunk, and him look bad
all the time. I say 'What the matter.
Dave? You sick? But him no say
nothing. After that him say, 'Good
girl, Winapie, go way. I be all right
bimeby.' What you do my man, eh?
I think you bad woman."
Mrs. Sayther looked curiously at ths
barbarian woman who shared the life
of this man while she departed alone
in the darkness of night. â¢'
"I think you bad woman." Winapie
repeated in the slow, methodical way of
one who gropes for strange words in an
alien tongue. "I think better you go
away, no come no more. I Indian girl.
You 'Merican woman. Y,ou good to see.
You find plenty men. Your eyes blue
like the sky. Your skin so white, so

"Then come a little bit further into

he said, genially, ignoring or missing
the feminine suggestion of appeal in
her voice.^ "And you must be tired, too.
Which way are you traveling? Up?

it gently to the shore. Another instant

the man followed -her and together,
with a swift rush, they drew up the
canoe. The dogs were in a whining
mass about them, and as the girl stop
ped among them caressingly the man's
gaze fell upon Mis. Sayther, who had
risen. He looked, brushed his eyes un
consciously as though his sight were
deceiving him* and looked again.
"Karen," he said simply, coming for
ward and extending his hand, "I

y\ IT RS. SAYTHER'S career in
I V/l Dawson had been meteoric.
\^ < j to say the least. She was the
JL widow of a -well-known min
ing engineer, and why she, of all
women, should have come into the
country was the great interrogation.
But they were a practical breed, the
men cf the Northland, with a whole
some disregard for theories and a firm
grip on facts. And to rot a few of
them Karen Sayther was a most essen
tial fact. That she did not regard the
matter in this light la evidenced by the
neatness and celerity with which re
fusal and proposal tallied off during
her four weeks' ftay. And v.ith her
vanished the fact, and only the inter
rogation remained.
To the Ec-lution Chance vouchsafed
one clew. Her last victim. Jack
Couehran, having fruitlessly laid at her
feet both his heart and a 500-foot creek
claim on Bonanza, celebrated the mis
fortune by walking all of a night with
the gods. In the midwatch of this
night he happened to rub shoulders
with Pierre Fountains, none other than
head man of Karen Sayther's voy
ageurs. This rubbing of shoulders led
to recognition and drinks, and ultimate
ly involved both men in a common
muddle of inebriety.

APROPOS OF JONATHAN EDWARDS
.(Copyright, 1903, by Albert Sonnictsen.)
There came a lull.vA.sain the decks
were clear. v
"Come boys," shouted the second
mate, "get for'd and turn in."
The watgh just relieved moved with
difficulty down to leeward and pre
pared to skurry for'd to the forecastle,
there to snatch the few hours' rest.
But before they could gain the shel
ter of the for'd deckhouse the vessel
reared on its stern. They could not
climb that slanting deck. From for'd
came that awful, grpwing row again.
The green wall swept on, shot up
alongside, ready to topple. An impul
sive cry burst from the lips of all.
their danger forgotten In the sight be
fore them. ' Almost over their heads
rcse that gla^y, foam-streaktfd green
mountain, and on its very top lifted
the naked form of a man. his arms
outstretched, mouth agape, eyes star
ing, legs outspread, like some spirit
of the storm, wrapped in a smother of
froth and spray. They caught Just
that one glimpseâ then came the crash
â again the decks were flooded.
Fortunately all had gained some
hold, and when the waters subsided
none was missing. In the pumphole,
by - the " mainmast, they found the
naked, unconscious, but _atill living
body of their lost shipmate, washed
aboard by the reflux. The sea had given
up its prey.
"Swim, Sam, swim!" they yelled.
"Keep' it U3, Sam! Hang on, Sam!"'
They howled and gesticulated, and once
more the skipper tried to heave the log
line. They might. as well have spared
their efforts, as he'heard nothing from
them. Still, they^ saw him plainly.now,
saw his white face, his clenched jaws,
his " powerful ] arms beating the waves.
By. this time he had freed himself of
all his clothes. But except that he kept
himself up he was helpless; like a block
of wood he was whirled about and
tossed up and .. downâ ground by- the
waves as though they were indeed
chewing well before swallowing:.
Then.he suddenly disappeared. For
five minutes the men stood, still
clutching the rail. Instinctively they
bowed their, heads, as men do in the
presence of " death.
Again came one of those booming
rollers. They saw the drowning man
mount its 3lope until he was strug
gling in the hollow curve under the
combing - top. On it came, he in it.
With a heave the big ship shot up

by. breathless, watching him fight his
last fight and then be swallowed. , Â¦",'.' â¢
The ship was drifting, Tand; having
so much surface exposed' to the. wind
she naturally sagged to leeward faster
than the man. leaving him to'wind
ward. The ship was being blown away
from him. They tried to heave him a
lifebelt," .but the ? wind blew ifbaJck
against, the rail... <-?.-.. ; . " â¢-. â¢>â¢-'.
' Still I Sam fought ; manfully. - With
beating hearts they saw him rid .him
self of his gum boots; and even his
oilskin trousers â he ripped them. off
with-his sheathknife. Impulsively -.they
cheered/. Ha was dying' game.-'
;But- the' odds were against ,him.
Farther and farther they drifted away
from, him," catching only an occasional
glimpse of his naked shoulders as he
mounted Â¦ the seas "and toppled over
in gullen silence, climb 4 into* their oil
skins, while the seas bans the weather

heavy guns. : ;.-.;. Â¦.'Â¦;. Â¦.Â¦?Â¦Â¦Â¦;Â¦:Â¦Â¦-. I : : ..^ Â¦;^'-iiz- Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦'.
' "Eight bells! â relieve the watch!" "
Aye, eight bells; but the watch has yet
to. wait awhile, .for no mortal man
could wade those flooded, decks from
for'd to aft. Sea after sea, green and
white, pour over the bulwarks like the
breaking of a big dam. : $
Finally comes another lull. The ship
pauses as though to" rest, while the
tons of water on deck shot -out
through hawsepipe and scupper. Once
more the deck is visible, covered only
by the foam-rimmed sheets of rippling
water. The lee door of the forecastle
flies open, and one by one the men
shoot out, like bees from a hive, and
scurry aft, fairly throwing themselves
"up^the poop ladder.
\ All hands are aft â all but one. Old
Sam Harland, able seaman. -lingers to
fill his pipe,, as he invariably does, in
. fair . weather or foul. Creeping . Sam
they call" him. At last he crawls out,
shuts the forecastle door and starts
â¢aft. v
. Suddenly all hands shout and ges
ticulate to. him. He sees, but .the
shouts are lost in the roar of the gale.
Slowly he waddles aft, unconscious of
his danger. Were he to look behind him
he would see coming up on the weather
bow a distant but fast approaching
wall of greenish gray, its white top
apparently licking the low hanging
clouds.
He does see at last, but too late.
The ship gives a quick lurch,' a heave,
attempts to rise to the oncoming bil
lows, but fails. High-up, level with
the foreyÂ»rd, towers the white crest.
For one breathless moment to those
aft it seems to hesitate, lifts, leans for
ward, then falls, crashing down on the
whole for'd part of the ship. From
the rail top to rail top the main deck
fills in an instant,- each mast the cen
ter of a whirlpool of yeasty foam.
Then, as the ridge of the wave passes
under the ship, she lurches, rolls over
to windward into the hollow beyond,
dumping her deckload of seething wa
ter over her weather bulwarks Into
the sea.
If you were to put a dry pea into
an empty saucepan and then souse a
bucket of water- over \i you would
understand what happened to Sam
Harland, able seaman. His shipmates
saw him struggling in the foam, saw
him slowly sucked toward the bul
warks, then shot across their top into
the reflux of the sea outside.
' - What they felt is not part of the
-story; such accidents occur often, and
seamen are not prone to describe their
'emotions. "Han â¢ overboard. Sam
Harland, able seaman, lost at sea, Oc-
.tober 5." Such notes are common in.
logbooks. There were few of Sam's.
'shipmates who had not seen this trag- ,
i edy, enacted before. It was what f olr ,
lowed that was unusual. ':Â¦
Â¦ T "-Suddenly the mate'gave a yell, audi
ble even above the roar of the" tem
.pesL.
';â¢ .".There he is, boys; away to wind

Â¦"Â¦I They crowded "together to- the.
weather rail. | Sure enough, there he
"was,-' a black speck far out in the white'
' froth, his â¢ face ' ; turned* toward j them.
Then he rose on the crest of a wave,
â¢and -sank^outiof , their sight into the.
Â¦hollow beyond.'only to reappear again,
mounting another oncoming- billow.
'.'Already he had thrown oft his sou'
wester -" and oilskin coat ?â¢ and was
'Hopelessly beyond all hu-"
'man-aid j he-struggled" still, -while~ ; his
shipmates could only. stand helplessly
THE poets Â¦will" tell you that the
6ea never gives up its prey, but
if you were to repeat-that to the
eailormen about the docks of
Honolulu they would tell you "The
poets be blowed!" or something that
would mean the same. They would re
fer you to old Sam Harland, the night
watchman of the railway dock, who
:amÂ« there five years ago on the Henry
B. Howard. You would then demand
more detail, and in a humorous way
they would tell you how the waves once
took old Sam for their own and tried
hard to swallow him, but he proved too
bitter a pill. . even for the hoary old
ita, so it spewed him up again in dis
rust.
"Ye see," they say, '"Sam is a power
ful chap on the booze, an' his old car
cass is so-Â«oaked with rum that he
couldn't be digested. The sea took bim
and chewed and chewed for quite a
while, but he was Just a bit too tough."
I have heard Sam tell his story, but,
being a rank egotist, he tries to make
you believe that his swimming save!
him. which isn't entirely true. .His
' shipmates on the Howard told quite a
different story, and, according to gen
eral opinion, theirs was the ' tru;
version. '. .Â¦
The big four-masted bark Henry B.
Howard left New York in May with
general cargo for San Francisco.' Thid
brought her around the Horn in Au
gust and up to the North Pacific in
October, a bad time of year, just when
the equinoctial storms are brewing.
The Howard was just about five hun- ,
dred miles southeast of Hawaii when
one of these bitter gales struck her
and broucbt her hove to under lower
topsails.
The ordinary landsman doesn't quite
realize what a storm In those regions,
at that time of year, means. Sailing
is impossibleâ the ship that simply
holds her own against those giant mld
*ea billows is doing well. She is
stripped of all but three or four heavy
Uorm sails, enough to give her the
.-iecessary steerageway to keep her nosa
Dcinted toward the oncoming seas, so
:hat they shall not strike broadside on.
/ Thus had the Howard been hove
:o for three days, meeting each foam
tapped billow with an upward toss of
ler bows, sometimes shoving her nose
leep into the green seas,' sending pon
ierous cascades thundering down
'rom her forecastle head, flooding the
rain deck to the cabin aft..' Some
imes the forecastle, an iron' house on
leek, would be entirely submerged,
md then the men of the watch below,
Â»vho lay in upper bunks, could behold
lie sea through the plate. glass port
joles, as you see in an aquarium, cast
ng. a sickly green light over their
laggard faces and giving them a
leath-like pallor. With a gurgling
â¢oar -the water would drop and spread
if t, and good, wholesome light of day
tome in again.
Alt on the poop were gathered the
ifficer and the men/ of the watch on
leek, a dozen oilskinhed | figures
tlutching the lifelines rigged from ralP
Â» rail. Thus they stood, four hours
it a time, drenched, gazing stolidly at'
Jie whirl of spray and â¢ scud about
hem, with nothing to do, ' : only -to:

ashed to his post; his duty it "was 'to"

juch is the sailor's school of physical'
endurance.
One bell struckâ on the poop. Even

beauty. t
Thus to California really belongs al
most all the honor that has been show
ered upon both of these remarkable lit
tle girls.
And, strange as" it may seem, both
children are of almost equal size, with
hair that nearly matches in brilliant
golden tints shot through with brown,
and with large dark eyes, full of that
sweet angelic quality that is not lost
even befc-re the harsh eye of the cam
era. And in the face. too. when in re
pose, there Is that same serious,
thoughtful expression. Each wears her
hair parted in the center and falling
in soft ringlets about her ears and
throat, and with both children it has
the same natural waviness that be
tokens a gentle, lovable disposition.
And yet in real life each child bears
very little resemblance to the other.
fc-r all that they are so alike in so
many ways. *-'â¢-.:
But even though they are the only
two children on the Pacific Coast that
won prizes,* the honor Is nevertheless
great, when it is considered that they
were placed in keen competition with
over 1S.0OO other little American chil
dren from all parts of the continent.
It suggests a very interesting point
of comparison, therefore, where these
two fortunate little girls are so much
alike to decide which Is the more beau
tiful. As was said before four pho
tographs of wrtnsome Mistress Moist,
including a large one in the center of
the page, mueh on the same size as
this of Mistress Fischer, were published
last Snnday. Just look up that paper
and compare. them with these and see
which you think should be awarded the
Infantile "Judgment of Paris." But
â¢whether you feel equal to the taak.or
not, you win find both of them per
fectly adorable children.
LAST Sunday there appeared on
this page several photographs vt
little Margaret Caroline Moist of
Oakland, the on!y baby in Cali-

coincidence
About a year and a half ago a very

Ruchings of all kinds are,, in again

This tiny little white box plaited

spring and summer gowns. This style
will hold its, own all the season and it
is a style .that Is becoming to every
hend and arm.- â¢
While mentioning the new features
of the season,. the round neck and the
full sleeve roust not b? forgotten. A
great many necks are cut without the
collar and the neck is finished with
niching.; This is all very nice for the
woman with a pretty throat, but a
little trying fcr the woman with a thin
neck. ,
The full wide sleeve, falling away
from the arm, is also a little hard
upon the woman without an attract
ive hand and wrist. But the new
sle?ves have so many inner ruchings
and r.re so splendidly full and so at
tractively finished that they divert the
eye. They cover the arm pretty well
and form a sort of dressing of their
own. so the thin armed woman can
take comfort.
The banding of the hair with gar
lands needs a chapter all to itself.
The hair, which "is twisted In a long,
low figure eight, is twined with sprays
of flowers, which are pinned into it
with invisible pins. One long spray
can be wound in and out through the
hair or a. little wreath can be laid on
top of "the coiffure. Never were gar
lands more fashionable for hair dress
ing that at just the present time.
Garlands of silk flowers and of met
allic ones and garlands of natural
blossoms will be worn for evening and
for ceremonious dinners, and in ar
ranging these the woman who wants
to introduce novelty must trim her
skirt "with a garland laid In slanting
fashion across the front breadth. She
must also trim her bodice and she
must twine a garland In her back
hair. '
The waist, which was cut on the
shirt-waist order, bloused and belted
under a girdle, had a vest of colored
beads. These were very fine and very
glossy looking, almost like Jewels. The
effect was opalescent and alluring, and
certainly very deceptive from a stand
point of cost, for no nice trimming
could have beendess expensive. Bead
ing Â¦ a pattern In little colored beads
upon a cloth skirt is nice work for the
artistic dressmaker.
There has probably never been a
spring in which so many novelties
were introduced. One of the quaintest
yet most effective is the fancy for bead
ing the front breadth of the dress skirt
in fancy designs. A gown of biscuit
coloied cloth has a queer-shaped figure
beaded upon it "just below the belt
and extending south," as the seam
stress expressed it. The pattern was
a big beaded point.
The gown, which was. a very nicely
tailored or.o â a little too fine for pedes
trian wear and intended really for call
lnsr, was banded and piped with tur
quoise blue.
a. new gown made for every occasion,
was ' in champagcs-colored veiHng:.
The front of the skirt was perfectly
plain, displaying a very long, wide
front breadth. Upon the hips at the
skirt was laid in little groups of gath
ers which extended all across the back.
This gave the figure a long, graceful
set of lines. Around the bottom" of
the skirt there were two flounces, each
one with a shirred heading. The shir
ring consisted of several rows' with
fat puffs in between and cordings laid
in the puffs.
A Spring of Novelties.
IT was at a ball in St. Petersburg
that an American belle revived an
o'<?-ncw fashfon.
Her crown, which was a spark
ling tulle, with threads of silver
woven hi it. was trimmed with silver
garlands. One great garland, all made
of si!vcr roses and silvered rose leaves,
was fastened at the side of the skirt
jind trouffht across the front breadth.
It v.as a yard long, not counting the
Ions and 'trailing stem which wound

sngly upon her head. The toquÂ» was*
irirr.rr.ed with that trimming which
never goes out of style. namsly, u long.
glossy ostrich plume. Her jewelry
was dull silver set with red stones.
While speaking of spring fashions
one must mention the material called
crushed velvet, which, while by no
means a spring material, will never
theless be much worn. Crushed velvet
comes in very light weights and makes
a very lovely spring: gown. It can be
found in all shades and. If well made,
it looks very much like a very nice
quality of baby lamb.
If you are the owner of an old vel
vet gown, or of a waist which you
â¢wish to "crush," take it and wet it
thoroughly on the right side. Now
twist it violently in the hands, wring
ing it well. Let it lie over night all
twisted and the next day you will have
crushed velvet. This is the best way
for an amateur to make it.
The Flounced Skirts.
In the spring novelties there must
be mentioned the flounced skirts, which
are trimmed with from one to three
Â¦wide flounces around the foot. The bot
tom one lies upon the floor; the second
one comes half way up to the knees,
and if there is a third flounce It is as
high as the knees. Over this faJIs the
skirt proper, looking like a semi-skirt
or oversklrt.
A great change is taking place Jn
dress skirts, and it takes an artistic
dressmaker to cut and hang them. As
one woman expressed it: "My skirts
are very wide on the floor and very
small at the hips. Yet I can scarcely
tell what makes them so." As a mat
ter of fact, the skirts are cut wide all
the way from the belt to the floor, but
they are tucked and shirred around the
hips to make them set close.
Meny of the new skirts are made in
â¢ many gores and are laid in Inverted
plaits all around the belt. This gives
the skirt a full look without adding to
the 6ize of the hips. Again, a skirt is
R-athered or is laid in accordion plaited
folds around the belt, while the foot Is
Immensely full.
Though skirts are very full, there are
no short women, for every effort Is
being made to preserve the height
Slenderness and tallness are the two
qualities most earnestly desired by wo
men, and all the lines of the skirt are
drawn with a special eye to height and
elenderness.
Thus if you will study the new gowns
you will observe that the skirts, though
full, are by no means dumpy In ap
pearance, and yon will also soe that
the lines are long and flowing, rather
than of tht cutoff order.

Suits of velvet are stitched with cat

of embroidery is particularly easy to
do and it offers a nice field for the

suit from a very plain one into some
thing that ia highly favored by fash-

very hard to find. Instead of the plain
severity of the tailored dress one 3ecs

acterizes the whole.

Velvet for Summertime.
The very round, very full skirts must
be cut long; they must be cut slightly
trained in the back and a little longer
than the ground on the -front and the
sides. The full skirt must also be ar
ranged as to its folds, so that there is
a sweeping appearance with the lin^a
all extending down from the belt, white
around the foot there Is a full flounce
to set off and finish the skirt.
Velvet, that queen of the winter. -
now rules the fashions in their spring
time. A thin velvet suit can be rec
ommended as a general utility gown,
for it makes a handsome carriage or
promenade dress: it is very fine for
a visiting gown; it ia Quite ceremoni
ous enough for receptions. And. for
a gown to have in the wardrobe, it
can be highly recommended to every
woman who desires to be sure of one
nice dress all the season. Moreover,
there is this about velvet that it never
goes out of style and the velvet gown
of this year can be made over into a
velvet shirt waist and separate skirt
next year, while In the seasons that
follow it can be converted Into an
Eton or a bolero or into trimmings
galore.
Velveteen has come into high vogue
lately. No one supposed that It would
ever be so popular for the making of
nice gowns. It was once worn sur
reptitiously as an Imitation velvet, but
it now comes out frankly as velveteen.
It is fine and soft, comes in many
shades and Is quite desirable for gen
eral occasions. In moleskin color,
trimmed with taffeta, it is charming
for spring wear.
The new hats are remarkable for their
becoming features. They are not too
severe; they do not set too far back on
the head; they are not too flat and they
are not too tilted. Taking one feature
with another, the hat of spring will be
the most becoming hat that has been
seen for many a year.

THE FABLE OF SWEET BEDELIA
must be just so. When you. come
home to your dinner you may be more
than reasonably certain that it will
not only be well cooked, but on time
and served on a spotless cloth and in
a dainty fashion. But like all other
good things she has her faults. Ten
to one she will insist upon your wiping
your feet on the door mat. before you
enter her spick and spaÂ§ hall and she
would not enjoy in the -least. Having
her exquisitely clean curtains perme
ated with cigar smoke, but if you want
to smoke a pipe in the front yard,
doubtless you â¢ will always find it
clean and religiously hanging on the
rack in its own allotted place. ,
The lady fair that brushes the lint
from your lapel softly, slowly and ten
derly with -the last three fingers of
her hand ts tne sentimental one, you
may be sure. . She would' delight In
walking a couple of blocks every even
ing to meet you and then keep you
waiting half an ho\ir for the potatoes
to cook. She Is made up of moods and
whims and as long as you remember
to j kiss her before leaving the house
she will be cheerful and happy and
you need never worry but â¢ that you
will be master or your own domain,
even if you feel -inclined to put your 1
head on the best white silk cushion
and your feet on the white Swiss bed
flounce.
With her as. a wife you will live
eternally in an atmosphere of romance
and billing and cooing, but the house
keeping will have to run itself. When
you have left her to her own devices
she is much more apt to plafnt ferns
and roses in the front yard than she
is to mend your unattractive but nec
essary wearing apparel, and when the
flowers quite satisfy her she takes the
latest novel, hunts a comfy corner and
wanders farther into the land of senti
ment and love making. Don't blame
her, for the girl that uses the second
and third finger unconsciously could
never be expected or, what Is more,
trained to be practical. It simply isn't
In her.
The listless hand is not to be toler
ated for . a single instant, for a hand
that droops wearily from the wrist as
though It didn't have the strength to
hold itself up denotes a weakness of
character and a stupidity of mind that
are Impossible to forget#or to easily
forgive. Look out for her. As a rule
she Is lazy, and she don't care who
knows it She thinks she Is- a wonder
and as a consequence doesn't try/ to
be anything worth cultivating, so she
only, succeeds in being a tiresome bore
that makes the very best hand of a
typical sour old maid.
Of characteristic hands there is just
one more kindâ the masterful one.
Instead_of brushing the dust away ten
derly or carefully, she opens her palm
and brushes it off in a calm, broad
fashion and 'as, though she were doing
her duty. Make up your' mind right
then and there that she is the athletic
girl who can sit a mean horse as tran
quilly as she can dance in a ballroom.
She Is one of the. advanced woman's
club's sort of a lassie and revels in
nothing quite as much as bossing her
fellows about and making it known
and felt that she has the biggest finger
in the pie. At home she may attempt
to read the riot act if you arrive an
hour late for dinner, or, worse still,
fail to come at all: but, generally
speaking, if you can convey to her
intelligent shrewd mind that you are
her lord and master and Intend to be
such. to. the end. of the chapter she
will, generally cool down and make a
better, truer woman by being in touch
Â¦with the men and women who are in
terested In the doings of the world.
How many girls do you know that
have a little habit of pigeon-holing a
man and talking to him an instant in
this charming confidential fashion?
Such a girl is a wise one, for she makes
If you would test some girl that you
find is stealing your heart, study her
hands and if you remember the little
snuggly way that it rested in your own
more than the color of her eyes or
hair you may know that she will guide
you gently and patiently through life
and you had better go no further in
your search. Of all hands, the hand
of hands, that attracts and holds at
tention Is the one that laughs and sobs,
that flutters and flirts and that ex
presses emotions of all kinds, for she
13 the girl that will never grow tire
some or be a hopeless bore, even after
she has turned the comfortable age at
forty, for variety Is the spice of
her life and she will make it her busi
ness to see that your home Is so at
tractive that your friends will flock to
your fireside and will rise up and call
you both blessed.
Have you noticed the girl who throws
her hands out wildly or who grabs at
anything or everybody within reach
when she Is frightened. She'll lead you
a merry, merry life, for she Is as full
of moods and tantrums as an egg is of
meat. Instead of making marriage her
forte in life she ought to take up the
stage as a profession, for the dramatic
hand never fails to have long, slender
fingers and a sinewy back.
A woman's face may be perfectly Ir
resistible, but her hands. If they are at
all expressive, are perfectly fascinating.
No matter how soft and white, how
loaded down with rare and beautiful
jewels, the fat hand repels rather than
attracts. It Is too complacent, too self
satisfied, and at a glance one may read
ily know that its possessor hasn't the
least particle of fluffy, rollicking sense.
And another hand that falls to at
tract attention is the one that suggests
the thumb too plainly. Without know
ing exactly why you may like a girl,
yet there is a weird something about,
her that will not out. Look at her
thumbs carefully and If they are too
prominent and are used too express
ively make it your business to spend
your evenings elsewhere, for the thumb
expresses that which Is lowest and the
Coarsest,, and it was meant distinctly
for use and not for beauty.
you fsel as tnougn you were the only
person on earth that she would dream
of being so familiar with. Give her a
bow of ribbon or a sprig of green and

jauntily, with her hand upturned from
the wrist and the object held by the tip
of her ngers, will she turn and twist it
until she is quite satisfied, and in this
selfsame, alluring manner will she coax
the money from your pocket until she
has plenty for her purpose. She hasn't
studied the arts of the world for
naught.
ONCE upon a time there lived in
the town of Splurgeville an aw
fully nice girl. Her name was
TBedelia.
Bedelia was old enough to have her
own say about it and was laying for a
chance to prove it to some man .who
was sober and industrious. * Mother
urged her to make a few concessions
just for the sake of gaining time.
Whenever one of the young : gentle
men dropped in of an evening, mother
would get into her Â¦ flowered wrapper,
touch up her complexion and prance in
to the parlor to extend the 'glad hand
and be real pleasant. No matter which
one it happened to be, mother would do
her best to have him feel that when the
proper time came he, of all the men in
the world, could bank on her approval.
After putting it -up 'to. him so strong
that it really wasn't worth while leav
ing anything to his imagination, moth
er would beg to be excused while she
ran for the 'lemonade and' layer cake.
When the refreshments were "over it
would be time for the caller to be~ going.
Bedelia would see him to the door and
say, 4 "Now do . come back real - soon.
We'll surely.- have better, luck* next

for about six consecutive seasons. ."
In the* course of time mother became

Then there is the girl who brushes
specks from your coat Make a scien
tific study- of that hand, for it will tell
you a variety of stories. If she picks
up the bit of thread very carefully
and between the thumb and fore
finger, it Is an assured sign that she
is not only a practical woman, but
that she possesses executive ability
as well. Her very care tells you, or
It should, that she would not run any
chances and that one doing is quite
sufficient If you. are a crank on or
der, marry her, for she is just the sort
of woman to run about from room to
room after you picking: up your be
longings that have been scattered in
your progress. There won't be any
more socks with the heels and toes
out or any more trousers that look as
though they _ had never seen the in
side of a tailor shop, for she is
methodical by nature and ' will take
delight in seeing that the. wheels of
her house are always well oiled.
Generally she is an abject slave ! to
this selfsame house and everything
artificial in the bargain. And the se
cret is very, very simple. There are
opportunities galore for you to pass
her a glass of water or to attract her
attention just as she is reaching for it.
Unconsciously and .without thinking of
herself in the least, she will take the
glass and then is your coveted oppor
tunity. If she holds it with her thumb
and first finger and bends her second
and little finger in an affected manner,
don't trust her, for she is artificial be
yond a doubt Then look to the drink
ing part. If she drops her eyes and
contemplates the bottom of the glass,
you may be certain that she is modest,
retiring and thoroughly lovable, but
if she gazes wistfully or laughing over
the top of the crystal, she is a natural
born flirt and is intent on landing you
as high and dry as she can without
making it too apparent.
The girl who wears a chain about
her neck and then puts in her days
fingering and counting each bead and
sliding them back and forth is restless
and has a boundless supply of energy
which is worked off in this fashion/ Sho
must be up and doing and if she la
forced to lead a humdrum sort of ex
istence for a couple of hours she frets
and fusses and works herself and
everybody else that chances to come
near her into a nervous state that is
anything but pleasant. Beware of her,
for she wouldn't wear well at all after
the excitement of the honeymoon was
over. Each day" she must go just so
much whether she is accomplishing
anything or 'not/and she is exactly the
girl that insists on dragging a man out
to a reception when he has come home
tired and his home seems about the
best and most inviting place on earth
to him.
*~7\ BIT or advice to you, Mr. Man.
f I Instead of looking Ions and
{^ I earnestly at a girl's piquant,
JL laughing face, look at her
hands and see if they tell you any
thing that is well worth kno'wing. For,
even if you don't know it, you can tell
for a certainty whether she will make
a good wife or not by the Way she
brushes an imaginary speck from your
coat or arranges a flower in your but
tonhole. - % You needn't sniff the air and
look wise, for you really cannot afford
to let such a golden opportunity pass.
Watch the way fhe passes you your
teacup, and you can tell, if you are any
judge of human nature, whether she
will hurl that self-same cup at you the
morning after your first night out, or
whether she will devote herself to bath
ing and fussing over your splitting
head, and have the common sense to
delay her lecture until the world is
looking just a trifle more cheerful and
your stomach is a bit more settled and
consequently up to a serious talk.
There are an infinite number of sug
gestive things that you can discover
about miladl fair If you will study her
hand scientifically; but, remember, first
of all. that It Is not quite the easiest
subject on earth to master. For in
stance, note the way she gives you the
tip of her dainty fingers in shaking
hands, and you may Judge of the
warmth and depth of her love and the
sincerity of heT heart.- True, it is a
bit awkward to note your best girl's
fingers when they are encased in your
own. and you cannot very well mi
nutely "investigate, even if the idea
suddenly occurred to you, the lines in
her hand when you are squeezing it
and murmuring sweet nothings.
But there will come an hour when
you can't manage to -say a new or
clever thing to save your life, and then
Is the time to sit up and take notice, as
It were.
YÂ» r eII-bred people can control the
muscles of their faces to an astonish-
Ins: degree, but no woman, from Ma

cook, can control the twitching hands
that are always such a give-away. It
isn't such a difficult art to smile when
you feel like crying, to purr when you
fec-l like kicking the house into splint
ers, but if you can hold the telltale
hands and fingers passive and quiet

To run an ordinary foot race Is easy
enough, but toÂ»run at full speed for
several hundred yards holding in one
hand a spoon on which rests an egg
and to reach the goal without dropping
the egg Is a feat which must be prac
ticed carefully a long time before it
can be performed successfully and as a
result there are not many who can be
sure of accomplishing It whenever they
try. Great, therefore, was the surprise
when an Italian officer mounted on
horseback performed this difficult feat.
Moreover, he selected a course in which
there are two or three high fences, and
these he cleared at full gallop without

Some of the most remarkable Egyp
tian jewelry ever discovered has re
cently been unearthed. The date as
signed is as remote as 5000 B. C, but
the workmanship in gold and jewels is
marvelous. In exploring the tomb of
King Zer it was found that the tomb
had been entered for robbery at some
remote period and that the plunderers
had broken off the arm of the mummy
queen and hidden it in a crevice in the
wall â perhaps on being discovered or
alarmed â and had never returned to re
move It.
On taking off the wrappings Professor
Petrie found four magnificent brace
lets of gold, with amethyst* turquoise
and lapislazuli in varied and elegant
adjustments. The gold work was pecu
liarly fine and delicate, though the
metal was soft and pure, apparently
with no hardening alloy. The stones
were beautiful and very strikingly and
peculiarly arranged.

presence of warmer and therefore light

ONE sees occasionally in. the
daily press an account of the
blowing out of the fuse on an
electric car. Now the greatest
dan.r~T to the passengers in such a c*aee
lie? in the possibility of some unex
pected happening < ausing a panic. It h
therefore most desirable that everyone
ehoui<J know what may be expected tc
happen on a car, and that the happen
ing is not necessarily an indication of
danger.
If a steam engine is overloaded, it
will stop and refuse to work, although
the full pressure of steam may Im
pinge upon the piston, and not cause
any danger. On the other hand, a ma
tor, when overloaded, tries Its best to
do the work thrown upon it. If it can
not run at full speed It will run at
Â¦whatever speed it can. As the speed
decreases', the current through the
motor increases, and the motor adjusts
itself to that speed at which the turn
ing effort is sufficient to cause rota
tion and do the work.
The current which will flow through
a motor when It is standing still is in
fcimost all cases far in excess of that
Â¦wheh the motor is designed to carry;
and. indeed, in a well-designsd motor
& current dangerous for the mator will
be leached before the motor hn3 been
stalled. The effect of this heavy cur
rcrt on the motor, if allowed to con
tinue, is to heat the windings to a dan
gerous degree and destroy the insula
tion, possibly setting it on fire; and it
is to prevent this occurrence, whether
due to careless handling of the car or
to unexpected causes, that the fuses
ere used. A fuse is simply a short
piece of wire of such size that it will be
melted by a current which. If allowed
to flow through the motor for any time,
will damage it. When a fuse blows,
then, it simply means that one of the
safety devices on the car has operated
to prevent damage to the motor. The
melting of the fuse opens the circuit
end cuts off the current from the mo
tor. To protectthe car the fuse is in
clcsed in a fireproof box.
There is another device for accom
plishing this purpose, Â¦which Is known
as the circuit-breaker. This is a
switch controlled by an electromagnet,
which opens whenever the current
reaches a certain dangerous value. This
mechanism ia now generally installed
upon â¢ electric cars in addition to the
fuse. It is often placed on the roof of
the platform over the motorman's
hf&i, where it is easily reached, and it
is set to operate at a higher current
value than the fuse, because the cir
cuit-breaker acts almost lnstantane
ously.while it takes a little time for the
fuse to be melted. Now, a motor can
stand for a second or two a current
which would destroy it if applied for a
longer period. The circuit-breaker,
then, takes care of heavy overloads,
and the fuse protects the motor against
those smaller currents which are dan
gerous if applied for a considerable
time.
When a fuse blows there is generally
a volatilization of the metal of the fuse
and a slight explosion. These explo
sions usually cause a report and some
smoke. When the circuit-breaker is
opened' it draws an electric arc in
breaking the circuit, and as in this arc
a considerable amount of energy is dis
sipated in heating the air, there may be
here also something of an explosion;
but in neither case is there any danger
to the passengers when the apparatus
is properly Installed. The fuse and the
circuit-breaker are safety devices, the
operation of which indicates, not that
there is danger to those on the car, but
that danger to the motors has been
averted. â Electrical Review.
Odd Accident
A source of constant annoyance and
injury to storekeepers, especially retail
ers, in extremely cold weather is the
gathering of frost on their display win
dows. Various devices have been tri ed
to remedy it, such as the application of
glycerin and other chemicals, but
these are generally of little avail.
In Northern ' Russia, where aero
weather is not an uncommon experi
ence, the owners of display windows
employ as an effective protection
against frost a . three-inch space be
tween two panes of glass. The outer
sash is rendered as nearly tight as pos
sible by calking and pasting strips over
the crevices. A second saeh Is then
fitted and inserted about three inches
within the first. This double sash ia
said to keep out moisture, and If the
glass is kept 'clean and dry is said to be
effective. At any rate, this plan Is
worth trying in these days, when win
dow dressing has become so Important

the demand for burglar proof safes.
Any burglar who touches a safe nowa

of a safe deposit vault is likely to set
off an electric alarm system that will

have not had a bank burglary of any

"In constructing fireproof safes for
offices in the skyscraper buildings we
have to look out for danger from falls
as well as destruction from fire. That
is where the modern safe has stood
the supreme test in the Baltimore fire.
One of our safes, weighing 6000 pounds,
fell nine stories and is barely dented.
Not long ago one of the modern safes
fell 12 stories down the elevator shaft
of a New .York skyscraper. It cost
$1200 to repair the elevator shaft and
only $28 to repair the safe. Some of

cannot fall apart. It has eight flanges,
compared with" four in the old 'safes.
The bolt-work and lock are away back
of the fire-proof filling, and not on the
edge of the door, as formerly. The fire
proof filling in the flanges or steps is
of asbestos, marble dust and chemi
cals. Each manufacturer uses his own
composition of chemicals, and keeps it
a secret. . The chemicals generate
steam during a fire, which not only
assists in preserving the contents of a
safe, but reduces the chances of metal
expansion. .

are more expensive than they were.

double breasted blouses ' and knicker r
bockers of that - color." ' The footguards
The Cossacks are armed with rifles
without bayonets, with swords without
guards, and the men in the front ranks
In each company also carry ' lances.
They take preat care of their horses,
and are esteemed as among the most
daring:, tireless and relentless soldiers
in the world.
The horses and uniforms of the-Cos
sacks are furnished by the various Cos
sack tribal communities, and in camp
the curious tribal signs hang over the
entrances to the quarters of each regi
ment. In active service the Cossacks
are the eyes and ears of the Russian
army. They are the scouts, the path
finders, the courier, and orderlies when
desperate and dangerous work is to be
done. They are much more independ
ent than the common soldier of the
army, and are also treated with much
more consideration by the military au-'
thorlties.
Russian empire alone has 30,000,000
horses, or nearly half of the grand total.
In the regular army of the Czar there
are no less than half a million horses,
and this number in time of war might
be easily doubled.
How valuable this vast cavalry force
may be in the Far East may be ques
tioned, for allowing to each horse a
daily ration of twenty-five pounds of
fodder and taking it for granted that
Manchuria and the adjacent provinces
raise little that might be used for horse
food, it is bard to see how any large
number of horses can be permanently
maintained at the far end of a single
track railroad more than 5000 miles
long.
In the Russian cavalry, of course, the
most picturesque, corps is that of the
Cossacks. The Cossacks are really pro
fessional soldiers. They almost live on
horseback, and are the only horsemen
in the world who equal the rough riders
of the' Far Western States in. feats of
horsemanship. ' They come from about
the Black Sea, and out of a total popu
lation of 3,000,000 furnish 150,000 men
for the imperial army.
Lying at League .Island Navy Yard,
Philadelphia, are the last^ of the old
monitors, such as the Lehigh, Mon.tauk,
Jason, Cancnicus and Nahant, which
have been condemned and . will prob
ably follow the same course as the
preceding ones, which were demolished
and sold for old scrap iron. These old
Â«ivil war monitors also acted as coast
defenders during the Spanish-Ameri
can war,' but were never in a position to
do active" service during that war. The
story of the meeting of the Monitor and
the Merrlmac is well known. One week
after the \ battle of those two vessels,
March 16, 1862, an order was given by
. the Navy Department - to [ Ericsson 1 to
build with" all possible speed six vessels

Three of these vessels were built at the
Continental Iron Works, where the or
iginal Monitor was constructed, â¢ while
the others were built elsewhere. -

ings and facings on their green coats.
Some of the lancers wear blue, and the
Czar's hussars are brilliant in scarlet.
The Cossacks wear mostly dark blue
or green. But the general effect, the
prevailing tone, Is dark green, except
in the hot months, when white *ls the
leading note.
As to equipment, a Russian infantry
man carries thirty rounds of ammuni
tion in his belt, thirty more rounds In a
bandolier hung over his left shoulder
underneath his great coat which is car
ried there done up in a roll, and a final
reserve supply of ammunition, consist
ing of thirty rounds, carried in a pouch
which hangs (rom a strap running over
the left shoulder and attached to the
belt. From the right shcoilder Is sus
pended his waterproof kit bag, and on
top of the kit bag is an aluminum
water bottle holding a pint and a half.
To the great coat is strapped a pair
of boots and an aluminum mess dish.
Besides this every six men carry among
them the materials, for a tent which
will properly shelter them, so that it
may easily be seen that the Russian
soldier Is considerable of a weight car
rier.
The medical and surgical depart
ments of. the Russian army are finely
developed. There are -six large and
more than 300 smaller hospitals regular
ly connected with the army, besides a
much . larger number 'â¢ of smaller laza
rettos. There are more than 3000 sur
geons in the army on a peace footing,
and most of them are men of advanced
training and high standing in their
profession.

whole male population of the empire,
with the exception of certain outlying
districts, is made liable to military ser

To the ordinary man on the street
the Stock Exchange is the home of
mystery. Stock brokers are looked upon
; with more or less awe. They are sup
posed to be capable of anything, and
There is a saying In London to the ef
fect that "there's no telling what (or
who) a broker won't do."
Should a stranger inadvertently wan
der into the London Stock Exchange â
passing: unobserved the barriers guard
ed by watchmen called "waiters" â the
.mystic words "Fourteen new
fives" is called out by some one, and
immediately the sedate London Stock
Exchanpe is converted into a rough
housp. The Innocent stranger finds

to that paragon of dijni
tied perfection, the London policeman,
avgjieth nothing. Xn policeman would
dare to enter the Stock Exchange to
interfere in a matter of this kind. One
policeman did invade the exchange
once â on the occasion of the arrest of
Captain Webb, a member of the Ex
char.fre â but he was so severely handled
that it has been a salutary warning to
all the other bluecoatB to let the bro
ker? manage their own affairs.
This practice of entertaining strang
ersâor rathtr entertaining themselves
at the expense of strangersâ Is called
"bonneting." and corresponds in a
measure to the treatment meted out
to a new member of the New York
Stock Exchange at his first appearance
on the floor. London "bonneting" Is
intended to be more or less serious, and
to act as a warning to persons of In
quiring turn of mind not to indulge
their curiosity inordinately.
The London Stock Exchange is fre
quently confused with the august build
ing known as the Royal Exchange. As
a matter of fact, the latter building
is now wholly occupied by Lloyds Ship
ping House, and other insurance com
panies; while the Stock Exchange prop
er is in a far more modest habitation
In a court off Thogmorton street, the
'famous banking thoroughfare.
jj The London Stock Exchange came
Into existence about 1801, when a num
ber of brokers "got together" in order
to separate themselves from the dis
honorable bunko steerers who in those
days worked "on the curb."
The first London Stock Exchange be
gan in Jonathan's Coffee House, and
the rules and regulations made there
more than 100 years ago are in_full
force to this day, with, perhaps, slight
modification in order to adapt them
selves to the needs of modernity.
There are to-day about 3000 members
of the London Stock Exchange. Re
markable to say, none of these men is
well known in public. While, In New
York and other cities the Stock Ex
changes boast such financial lights as
Henry Clews, Russell Sage, the Goulds
and Rockefellers, in England corre
sponding men, such as the Rothschilds,
are not Stock Exchange members.
There are no very prominent London
financiers who are members of the Ex
change properâ that is, no men of great
social or political notoriety. If one
were to compile a list of the leading
members of the London Stock Ex-
tered against him, or a summons, or ; Â¦
bill of sale has been registered in hiJ
name, he is forever disqualified from
operating as a member of the London
Stock Exchange. There are two agen
cies In Londonâ Messrs. Stubbs and
Perry, who keep the closest accounts of
financial transactions, and who have
the records of all debt transactions.
These agencies keep the Stock, Ex
change posted on all persons in debt in
chance, probably out of the 3000 names
not five would ever have been h'eard of,
not only in America, but in London
itself. \ '
. The -two best known men on the Lon
don Stock Exchange are Edward
Clarke, the .trustee and manager of
the Exchange, and Edward Satterth
waite, the secretary. These two men
have practical charge of the London
Stock Exchange, and in their hands, it
might be said, rests the fate of ever/
member. It is they who decide to
"hammer" defaulting members, or
those who, when pay day comes, are
unable to meet their obligations. -
Every member of the London Stock
Exchange has to be of gilt-edge finan
cial standing. For instance, before a
member can be elected, he must submit
his entire financial record to a select
committee. He must, of course, n*ver
have been bankrupt. But this - is not
all. If he has ever had a judgment en-
Should a would-be member pass sat
isfactorily all , inquisitions, he is re
quired to pay down $2500; to find three
sureties, taken from existing members
of the Stock Exchange, in the -sum of
$7500, and to pay annually $150. Seats
on the London Stock Exchange are not
sold as s in New York, Chicago and else
where at high figures; but the scrutiny
through which every applying member
has, to x pass is certainly more exacting
than paying down cash any large sum
of. money.
When. an applicant has passed the
most rigid examination by the select
committee, he is referred to a govern
ing committee, a body of thirty 'men,
before whom he undergoes further ex
amination as to the exact nature of
the business he wishes to transact on
'Change.
London who nave come under the at
tention of the courts.
This Is the most terrible fate that can
befall a member of the Stock Exchange.
From' that moment he ceases to belong
to the institution and neither he nor his
clerk can j again enter its precincts.
Large sums have been wagered by
Stock Exchange men as to the manner
in which a "hammered" member will
commit suicide.
Members, however, are very rarely
hammered. If a broker or jobber is in
difficulties the others usually come to
his rescue, unless very gross negligence,
not to say dishonesty, is proved.
The gentleman who has to report to
the committee which decides whether a
If a member of the Stock Exchange
fails to meet his liabilities on settling
day, which is every alternate Monday,
he is 'â¢hammered." The secretary, Mr.
Edward Satterthwaite, calls out his
name, and then gives his desk three
sharp blows with his ivory hammer.
The exchange is opened by one of the
janitors of the building sounding an
old-fashioned policeman's rattle. At
S:53 p. m. the same rattle is sounded,
announcing that the closing hour â I
p. m. â is approaching.
Business after this time is resumed
in the street just outside the exchange,
even the oldest members becoming for
the nonce "curb stone" men. This is
due to the fact that It Is only after 3
p. m. that American markets become
lively, as New York cannot get Into
cable touch with London till about 2:52.
London time, which is five hours later
than New York.
It is in the afternoons also that large
business is done with Berlin, Amster
dam, Paris and other European places.
"With its antiquated customs and cu
rious way of transacting business, the
London Stock Exchange is to-day one
ef the most unique institutions in Eng
land. It Is well worth a visit by any
"outsider," but this Is only to be done
with the consent of five members of the
exchange, and is by no means an easy
matter to negotiate.
To the mere stranger, unknown to
any one on 'change, a view of the Lon
don Stc-ck Exchange is a sheer Impossi
bility.
Members of the Londt-n Stock Ex
change can be distinguished from their
clerks at a glance.
They always wear glossy top hats
and long frock coate, except in very hot
weather, when by a special resolution
of the committee, they are allowed to
wear straw hats.
Their clerks, never wear hats, how
ever, either in the building or in Throg
mortc-n street, when they are on their
employers* business.
The time for opening the London
Stock Exchange is 10 a. m., but mem
bers do not. as a rule, assemble tefore
11, unless there is very pressing busi
ness on hand or great excitement in
the market.
The Stock Exchange wall: has since
been copied by butchers, policemen,
laundry girls, waitresses and Parisian
actresses.
The spirit of sport seems to have Its
habitat In the Stock Exchange. Fo.
every horse race of Importance tho
members hold a sweepstake. They
never let an oecasiim of public rejoic
ing go. past without making themselves
look ridiculous by acting like madmen.
During the South African war when
ever the news arrived of a British vic
tory, the members of the Stock Ex
change paraded the streets waving
Union Jack pocket handkerchiefs and
cheering madly. The day the news of
the relief of Jlafeklng was received
they attended business armed with
flags and penny trumpets, and "spent

Then he rose and went to the fence and
looked over at Miss Lavinia.
"Such devotion deserves a reward."
he said bitterly, as he watched her
work.
Miss Lavinia looked up at him from
under her sunbonnet.
"What do you mean, captain?" she
asked, as she pulled up a half dozen
tender young onions and dropped them
in her basket.
"Brother Werner is a lucky man,"
observed the captain, his accusing eyes
on Miss Lavinia. -4
The little woman blushed, then she
smoothed down her apron and looked
self-conscious. The tug at the cap
tain's heart was painful. What would
he do if he lost herâ his little neighbor
with the keen blue eyes?
"Captain." said Miss Lavinia, "I wish
you would step over to my porch for
a minute and have a little talk. Would
you mind?"
Would he mind! It was the joy of
his life to sit on that vine covered porch
and be talked to by Miss Lavinia, for
the captain was a rather silent man.
â¢while his neighbor was a woman of
many words.
"I want your advice," said Miss La
vinia when the captain was safe In the
big chair with the rbse flowered cush
ions; "I don't know what to do."
The captain's heart dropped like lead.
He fixed his eyes on the bit of blue
sea visible, from the porch as if he
would draw strength from It. If Miss
Lavinia wanted advice about the dea
con he felt that the case was serious. .J
for Miss Lavinia always gave rather
than asked advice.

Miss Lavinia went on hurriedly
"It doesn't sound just right to say It

"And the trouble Is." said Miss La
vinia ''that by all s lg ns and feelings-
I don t want to marry him."
v"What!" The captain brought his
eyes back from the ships and a wave
of rapture rippled.over his face.
"No, captain," repeated Miss La. I
vinia. "By all signs and feelings I
don't want to marry Brother Werner â¢â¢
The captain drew his chair closer
"And you want my advice?"
"Yes. How shall I keep him from
asking me? I like Brother Werner
and for his wife's sake I don't St*
hurt him. But I don't want him to ask
easier." said the captain.
How?
"Marry me." said the captain and
hitched his chair a little nearer
Miss Lavinia's face grew pink like
a girl's, and for a moment she looked
very young. Then she laughed a UtUe

After a blissful moment the- captain
murmured. "You'i, have to plant some
flowers in your garden now â¢â¢
."Why?"
"Because flowers are the language of^
love," said the cantain. t*n4erlÂ». Â¦
The captain pondered on these things
one Saturday afternoon as he watched
Miss Lavinia In* her garden culling let
tuce and radishes and big red raspber
ries for the next day's feast. The cap
tain knew just how that table would
look. Now and then, on high days and
holidays, he, too, had reasted -at his
neighbor's- table. The lettuce -would
surround a.- dainty salad; made from
chickens ot Miss Lavinia's own" raising.
The radishes would 'be - cut- like red
roses and would garnish the cold meat^
there would be crisp rusks, . and cream

Miss Lavinia was a devout church
member, and when Deacon Werner lost
his'wife it, was not long before people
began to couple the names of Brother
Werner and Sister Lavinia. For. did
not Brother Werner spend every Sun
day evening at Sister Lavinia's, and did
not Sister Lavinia set forth on the
weekly supper table all the dainties of
her skilled cooking?
The captain's suit had not progressed,
however, for after all their years of
acquaintance he discovered no more
tenderness in Miss Lavinia's glance
than In the beginning, and he hesitated
to declare himselfâ yet there had grown
up between them a friendship that per
mitted him to offer her the fruits of
his fishing expeditions, while in pre
serving and pickling time. Miss Lavinia
always filled certain Jars and glasses to
be set forth on the little table next door.
So things went on smoothy u^itil one
day the captain discovered that he had
a rival. y \

next door and kept
a very shipshape little yard, "but give
me something substantial. You can't

Now and then, when the captain
handed Miss Lavinia a bunch of sweet
peas or a cluster of roses over the
fence, he tried fo argue the question. .
"There's poetry In flowers. Miss La
vinia, and the language of love."
"Huh!" sniff e"d the little woman,
"who cares about the language of love
at my age?" And the captain would
go away very sad.
For years the captain had cared for
Miss Lavinia in a sort of nautical fash
ion. She was what he called a trim
little craft, and in spite of her sharp
tongue, he lived near enough to see the
tender acts that made her the blessed
lady of the community. There was not
a beggar, nor a stray dog nor a tor
mented cat that would not find help or
shelter at the little white cottage on
top of the hill. All the women of the
village came to Miss Lavinia with their
woes, and the men came, too, to get
sharp bits of advice, and now and then
a little loan of money without interest.
So, for fifteen years the captain and
Miss Lavinia. had lived in adjoining
cottages; he a widower longing for a.

ican soil.
Artists and artisans from all corners
of the globe have applied their skill and
genius in the construction of these
magnificent homes which have been
erected for the comfort of visitors from
afar.
On a level site at the east front of the
Administration building is the City of
Nations. Great Britain occupies a site
fronting 500 feet on Skinker road with
her building, a reproduction of the
famous orangery on the splendid
grounds of Kensington Palace, London.
This structure, the birthplace and home
of the late Queen Victoria, was built
in 1704 under the direct orders of Queen
Anne. It is one of the purest specimens
of Queen Anne architecture. The build
ing is surrounded by a quaint old Eng
lish garden, a cony of the horticultural
architecture of 200 years ago. The
whole tract is bordered with hedges of
yew, and these, with all the trees and
shrubs planted here, were brought from
Kensington gardens wrapped in straw.
Mexico's national pavilion is next to
the British building facing on Skinker
road. It was the first foreign Govern
ment building erected t.-n the World's
Fair grounds. Architecturally, it is a
reproduction of the patios or open
courts which form a feature of Mex
ican dwelling houses. The court is
roofed over, showing, however, an ar
caded cloister such as usually sur
rcrunds a patio. The structure is two
stories in height. The windows of the
upper story are photographic views,
showing cathedrals, monuments, pal
aces, parks and beautiful bits of seen-'
ery in Mexico. A gigantic picture of
President Diaz la stained glass holds
a place on the lower floor. This is
lighted by electricity at night. Sur
rounding the building is an exhibit of
the flora of Mexico, including banana
trees, agaves, cacti and palms. .*. large
force of men scoured the mountains of
Mexico to obtain plants for this gar
den.
Across Forsythe avenue and fating
on Skinker road France Is represented
by a replica of that harmonious and
delicate bit of architecture, the historic
Grand Trianon at Versailles. Sur
rounding the building, on the fifteen
acre rerervatlon. Is an elaborate speci

A broad driveway leads up a gentle
Â«Iope to the court of the Trianon. It
is flanked on either side by raised ter
races of sward, crowned by parallel
rows of parked Caroline poplars. Stat
uary intersperses the arc2de of trees.
To the south and west of the Trianon
is a garden of exotic beauty which fol
lows the vagaries of nature. Here are
tiny lakes and secluded nooks to de
light the romantic nature of the Paris
ian. The court of the building, formed
by the central structure and the L
ehaped wings, is traversed by walks
of pink gravel which are cooled by
a splashing fountain.
Slam's building, a reproduction of the
Ben Chama Temple, is next to Mexico
jn the west.
Next door is Nicaragua's low-roofed
pavilion surrounded by a garden of
plants Indigenous to that country.
Brazil occupies a site on the corner
of International and Forsythe avenues
with a pretentious structure. It Is
crowned by an Immense steel dome,
rising 122 feet above the ground, and is
flanked on the east and west by flower
gardens.
Belgium IÂ« represented on a site In
front of the Administration building by
a handsome and highly decorated
structure, a reproduction of the Ant

While the stranger was delivering
the bull-con to the rustics. Hesekiah
came back to the store on a dead run.
He called, hi* new acquaintance into a

hundred dollars i hÂ» Â« full payment for
exclusive ri^ht to sell, the patent chum
In ;the , whole of Seasongood County.
The '.cno-ras. were to be furnished to
Hezekiah at the factory price of S3 25

up> his mind to bamboozle the very
daylights out of; every city upstart that
came his way. Just on general: princi

One ni-rht while Hejzekiah was lean-
Ing against the'eounter and exuding a
steady stream oÂ£ '"wisdom, a

Hezekiah, as he walked over to thÂ«
man from way down Cast. They step
ped to the front of the store an* after
a t lengthy whispered conversa.tion.
Hezekiah dashed, out of the door and
made a bee-line for his home. The
newcomer -bought clears for the

ing appearance of Hedgeville and the
excellence of Â¦ the .sttrroundlns crops.
He said th.it he : had never met' more

would also warn his hearers

The wigwam, with Its 10,000 cheering
auditors, its fluttering banners and its
platform on which were seated as dele
gates hundreds of the brightest in
tellects in America, presented a picture
which will never fade from the eyes of
those who were privileged to behold it.
As a local reporter of the Milwaukee
Free Democrat I was accorded a place
at a long table In the center of the plat
form only a few feet from where the
wmte-naired abolition leader, Joshua
R. Giddtngs of Ohio, sat by the side of
his colleague, the trumpet-voiced David
K. Carter.
The Seward forc;3 were represented
by the suave and masterful William M.
Evarts of New York, who in turn was
counseled by that veteran of caucus
and convention â Thurlow Weed, the
head of the Albany regency. Pennsyl
vania presented an apparent candidate
in the Derson of Simon Cameron, but
his delegates never seriously expected
his nomination, and his I crilowers were
marshaled and kept together really for
the purpose of obtaining promises, the
fulfillment of which would inure to the
advantage of the clan.
Before the Chicago Convention of I860
assembled slavery had been routed in
its efforts to capture Kansas and Ne
braska. Nevertheless the "peculiar in-
stitution" refused to accept dsfeat. Its
avowed motto was "rule or ruin." an-J
it girded Its loins anew for the contest
of 1860. The result of thai conteat was
no longer doubtful. The Democratic
party was rent in twain, the great
North had broken its shackles' and thu
very air was electric with the presage
of the coming triumph of freedom.
â¢Yet to achieve triumph the member?
of the Chicago Convention felt that
there ] was j needed not merely a leadar
but a leader of leaders. A man for the
times was demanded, and the god o!
the eternities presented him in the per
son of Abraham Lincoln. Â¦ -"*~
He was the child off poverty and toil.
Not the hopeless poverty and cringing
toll of thos.e who labor amid the dia
cf European marts, but the manly sub-
mission to privation and unmastere J
toil of the Western pioneer, whoso ey3
of fate beholds the star off hope shining
above the clouds, and who in his
dreams of the future drapes himself
with the Senator's tc;a or the Judge's
gown. He was self-made and self-re
liant, but never selC-s^king or self
sufficient. He was honest, not with
that nurtured integrity which too often
proves an exotic that dies with the
first blast of adversity, but he was
honest by instinct and because it never
occurred to him to be othsr than honest.
He was in spirit and in' fact one of

He never lost sight of this purpose.
He was conservative when the prema
ture adoption of radical measures
might have alienated ths wavering and
weakened the Union cause. He- was
radical when the power of time and
circumstance crumbled the barri2r3 off
prejudice which for years had obstruct
ed the path to justice. His individual
ism was never absorbed or subverted
even by the genius and power of the
great men who counseled him. With
out being egotistic, or dogmatic, or
stubborn, he was firm. He "toot: each
man's counsel," but "preserved his own
judgment." Without previous training
in tha conduct of public affairs, he was
called upon to grasp the reins of gov
ernment when the chariot of state was
refekingr amid the convulsions of war.
But he kept a steady hand, and neither,
the terrified counsels of overcautious
conservatism nor the demands of un
thinking and improvident zeal could
drive him from the path along which
he believed the safety cf the nation
demanded that he should guide his
countrymen. It was his privilege- to
select the best policy for the time, and
his gift of discrimination was little
short of marvelous. He stands > ap

There are many words of Lincoln so
fitly and grandly said that they will
burn in the sky of history like fixed
stars when the masterpieces of great
orators shall have vanished with their
train of rhetorical splendors into
space. There are ideas of his which
victorious armies placed upon their
eagles and carried to a grander frui
tion than ever a prophet foretold or
poet dreamed. Never was ruler or rep
resentative truer to a trust than . he.
His reigning animating purpose was to
preserve the geographical integrity and
political unity of the Vnited States of
America, and to this was added a3 an
outgrowth of the war a determination
to extend the blessings of freedom to
every human being dwelling beneath
the shelter of its flag.
The bronzes of conquest were once
stricken from the column Vendome in
Paris because they perpetuated the
memory of triumphs won through the
blood and the tears of the people, to
glut the vanity cf an Emperor who des
olated the world that he might Illumine
a throne. But Chicago's commemora
tive colunins and arches are her iron
laced highways, her marts of trade, her
palaces of Industry, her mOes of beau
tlful bosses. The record of her victo
ries is greater than that of the Greek
who boasted that he never caused an
Athenian to put en mourning, for she
can say that her growth was so direct

master minds that the anthem of her
march to greatness has ever been the
cheery music of contented and well-

The great wigwam in Chicago near

the appointments and conveniences
now possessed br almost every public
hell. Electric lights were then un
kcoxn. The telephone girl, with gum
in her mouth and a suitor at her side,
did not respond to the calls of Impa

words "Mine busy." The motorman had

entail negro equality and miscegena

Just let her alone."
The argument against secession he
stated in a sentence: "Caa aliens make
treaties easier than friends can make

liberty than his appeal to Congress in
behalf of the passage of the thirteenth
amendment? "In giving freedom to the
slave," said he, "we assure freedom to

well known in London society and had
established a home in one of the most

found impossible to come to a fair and
satisfactory division of the wonderful
treasures stored in her house, 14

everything be realized and the pro

The Pope's sisters are Ideal house
keepers, and the little apartment Is
kept like a bandbox. It can scarcely be
said that the management of the
household is confided to any one of the
three, for Â«*acn takes a pride In it, each
orders as she likes, and. if the truth
must be told, they cause the little
maid-of-all-work to lead rather a life
of it. She Is a Roman, and although
ftrong and willing Is not accustomed
to the niceties of a house, and her mis-*
tresses are apt to find corners neglected
and dust in odd places.
The feelings of this small maid must
be :nixed and amusing. Being a devout
Catholic, the serving the sisters of the
Holy Fater is more than her ambition
ever dreamed of. while their particular
v.-ays are. to say the least, trying. So
while one moment she mentally kisses
their hands, the next she anathema
tizes them. Her conversation to her
intimates is something on the follow
ing lines: "Oh. the dear things! To
think that I live with the sisters of
his Holiness. They are saints!" And
five minutes later it is: "Oh, Madonna
mia! how noiose (what a nuisance)
they are. It is Maria here, and Maria
there, and Maria y/m dirty girl, and
Maria you careless thing, until I near
ly burst." After this outbreak comes
remorse, and it Is: "May the saints

ROME. March 12.â "vThen the peasant
Fisters of Pius X came to Rome they
began, as had been their custom in
Venice, by receiving every one who was
"kind" enough to call, until their mod
est apartment was besieged at all hours
and was more a public reception-room
than anything else. They found them
selves being Interviewed on all sides,
their most innocent sayings miscon
strued and words put in their mouths
which they had never dreamed of say
ing. Sometimes they were drawn out
to say things which were certainly pri
vate matters and which they in the in
cocence of their hearts imagined would
go no further. They were veritable
Iambs- in- the clutches of the wolves.
This went on for weeks, until they were
acutely uncomfortable, and until one
day Pius X questioned them about
some thiners which they were reported
to have said. Then the whole story
came out, and from that moment by
order of the Pod** himself absolutely no
one is allowed to enter their quarters
â¢without direct permission from the
Vatican or the family of the Pontiff
outside Rcme.
The thr^e ladies live in a bright, pret
ty apartment of seven or eight rooms
at 323 Corso Vittori* Emmanuele, near
the St. . Angelo bridge, five minutes'
Â¦walk from the Vatican. They are
lodged on the ground floor and have
plenty of that oun and air which their
souls love. The rooms are simply fur
nished with old-fashioned lace curtains
and plenty of cretonne, with chairs not
very remarkable for their comfort. The
tenants are not accustomed to lounging
and cushions. Â¦

Before they came to Rome some
amusement was occasioned by. the
speculations as to what they would do
when they, took their places among the
haughty Roman aristocracy. Certain
houses in the Eternal City which have
remained faithful to the Holy % See con
sider the Pontiff not only their spiritual
head, but their earthly "sovereign also,
so that his relations must be treated
as royalty. Scoffers employed their
time in drawing imaginary pictures of
the sisters' embarrassment; at dining,
for instance, with Princess Massimo
In appearance the good ladies are
comely, inclining to stoutness becomes
their years, but with nothing of the
handsome looks of their brother. There
is nothing to distinguish them from
hundreds of other women of their class,
but stilfthey have shown a good eense
and sturdy pride which many might
envy. For instance, they have never
worn hats.- and when the -nuns with
whom they stayed .when they^rst came
to Rome, presented them with modest
headgear, they, promptly refused, re
plying proudly' that they had, always
worn black lace and would continue to
do so. BSE
The Pontiff in the. beginning desired
thorn to live in the paldzzetto (little
palace) in the Vatican gardens, used
by Leo XIII as his summer quarters,
and which was almost rebuilt by him,
but for once in their lives they opposed
the will of their brother and flatly re
fused to "do anything of the kind. "We
might much better go into a convent,"
they said, "and you know none of us
ever felt that she had the vocation.
We . would die shut away from the
world like that, so quiet and melan
choly, with nothing to, look at but a
garden." Pius X promptly gave, way
and let them choose their own habita
tion, which is on one of the busiest
streets of- Rome. ''Â¦ \av ;
Father must do what- is right. They
cannot fail."
These simple and good folk at first
tried very hard, as we would Â¦say, to
"act the lady," but days of sitting with
hands folded^ as reading has no charms
for them, soon palled, and it- was not
long before one after the other took
up simple duties in a surreptitious way,
until in the end they kept the maid
only because Pius X insists that it
shall be so.
DO THKIK OWN MARKETING. .
Italians do their, marketing: every
morning, intrusting it to the cook, but
the sisters Sarto delight in doing it
personally, and drive very good .bar
gains with the tradespeople, who are
deference itself. Each has. her favorite
ilishes, so they take turns in satisfy
ing their tastes, each acting cook on
her own day, the others meanwhile ap
plying themselves to housework, with
the diversion of scalding the maid. This
â¢fills in the morning. The afternoons
are devoted to driving or walking,
sometimes in the. Vatican gardens, but
more often about the crowded streets,
as, having few friends, they are pleased
and interested in the movement and
variety of a large city.

London for some time, has now depart

schemes for starting a weekly news

beautified by the best that could be
done in the way of three-color printing.
Staying in great state at the Carlton

etc., and numbering in his suite a spe

the dyspeptic, this semi-invalid invited
first one and then another possible
managing editor to whom over coffee
and cigars he unfolded his Initial idea.
In several instances the possible editor
went away elated at the good thing al
most within his grasp and spent th<Â»
following few days thinking hard, ob

making up lists of prominent and suit
able contributors, -getting in touch
again with the distributing trade, etc.,

promised call. Occasionally this came
promptly, the would-be editor accept

represented by the recently discov
ered Toccata in D minor, Gluck by
the Air de Ballet according to Salnt-
Saens, and Wagner by the "Walkuren

It's a good programme, but I think
would have been bettered by the sub
stitution of a Beethoven sonata for
the one by Chopin. Nobly broad as
Bauer's sympathies are, the pianist is

ternoon the third of the novelty con

quartet for piano and strings by Rich
ard Strauss, in which as usual Mrs.
Oscar Mansfeldt will assist the Kopta
people. It is the first time the work
has been given here and there is much
curiosity among chamber music lovers
to hear it. '
Interesting also will be the Dvorak
American String Quartet, introduced
here by Mr. Minetti, .but since not
played. The lighter quartet numbers
include an Adagio by Rubinstein -and
a Bazzini Gavotte. Mr. Kopta will be
the soloist of the afternoon and will
play the ;*.'Perpetuo Mobile," by Riesâ
Mr. Kopta's playing of this fiendish
concoction is famous!â and a Romanze
by Svendsen. The programme does not
give the name of the violinist's ac

that he or she slips a stitch or two

I believe that San Francisco Is to
have the first of the numerous "Parsi
fals" that have impended since Herr

reuth. i This is not certain, as there
are already two or three at production
point and several on the way. The
most important undoubtedly is the
Savage edition, that will of course
have the full musical score.
The Alcaear is, however, first in the
field, with a dramatic version by Fitz
gerald Murphy, to be given to-morrow
evening for the first time. I know yet
nothing of the production but this
fact, that J. C. Williamson, the Aus
tralian Frohman. has purchased the
Australian rights of the Alcazar edi
tion. Again, the production is on a
scale that will be historical in Alcazar
annals. Everything: possible has been
done by the management to ensure the
play's success. The orchestra has
been doubled, a choir engaged, a well
known boy soprano annexed, and cos
tumes on a really splendid scale have
been obtained. Manuel Klein's musical
adaptation will be used.
The Alcazar cast of the drama is as
follows: Mr. Durkin as Parsifal, Miss
Block as Kundry, Kllngson the Magi
clan by Mr. Hllllard, Amfortes by Luke
Conners, Gurnemauz by Mr. Osborne,
and Titurel by Mr. Maher. The drama
will be staged with unusual elaborate

has been considerably enlarged for the
occasion.

as with.De Pachmann and Chopin, a

But when Chopin is most Chopin, as
when he is heaping shadowy pearls,
moonlit orchids, upon the sad and pas

his secret is not wholly Mr. Bauer's.

composers. . â¢
I never hope, to hear better Beetho
ven than Mr. Bauer's. There may be,
but I've never heard it, and cannot
conceive of it. His readings have the
stamp of absolute understanding, a
complete intellectual and emotional
sympathy. It is characteristic of a
Bauer auditor to forget the Bauer
technique. There were never fingers
that less obscured the player's soul
and brain than Mr. Bauer's.
It Is a technique that has become
automatic, a technique that has
never been an end, but always a
means. Mechanically It is distin
guished as before noted by a pecu
liarly beautiful cantilena, in which
the pianist's deft pedaling plays a
large part. Mr. Bauer's staccato is
also of the juicy sort and his tone in
the heaviest passages without a hint
of the hammer. As to mere speed, he
can do anything, and he thunders like
Thor, of whispers like Frela with equal
beauty. All through it is eminently
evident that Bauer has listened to
every note he ever made. There has
been no dull Iteration of passages with
cut thought, the pitfall of pianists.
Primarily he has thought of the tone,
the phrase, and the rest has taken
care of itself.

the little musical folk and others, has
been set for 2:30 o'clock at Lyric Hall

Monday, morning.
J. C. Williamson, the theatrical mag
nate of Australia, before sailing for
home last week, purchased from Fred
eric Belasco the sole Australian rights
to Fitzgerald Murphy's dramatization
of Wagner's music play, "Parsifal," to
be presented at the Alcazar March 14.
Mr. Williamson attended an orches
tral rehearsal at the Alcazar of the
Wagner music as condensed and ar
ranged by Manuel Klein of the New,
York Lyceum. He expressed himself
as much Impressed by the orchestra
tion, as well as the acting possibilities
of the legends of the Holy Grail.
Mr. Williamson will produce ,^arsl
fal" at Her Majesty's Theater, Mel
bourne; Her Majesty's, Sydney, and in
the long- chain of -other colonial houses
which are under his control. William
son is one of the most astute and suc
cessful of managers. He is taking
home with him the cream of London,
Paris and New York successes, and his
acceptance of "Parsifal" may be re
garded as a gratifying Indorsement of
Mr. Belasco's Judgment in selecting the
Wagnerian work for dramatic repre
sentation.
One of the tasks set for himself by
Kirke La Shelle, manager of half a
dozen successful companies, is to drop
in on one of them about once a week,
or oftener, and note how the perform
ance is given. ' He never tells any one
when he will be there. He Is not always
in the lower part of the house/either.
For instance, a few nights ago he was
discovered in the gallery of the Man
hattan, looking at "The Virginian." To
the ordinary auditor, the performance
seemed a model of smoothness and
artistic perfection. But hardly had an
officious usher passed the word around
that "the chief" was in the house before
Mr. La Shelle was on the stage, direct
ing that a rehearsal should be held the
next morning, at which half a dozen
points which he had jotted down on a
leaf of a notebook were to be gone over
until slight imperfections, he had de
tected were eliminated. It is this con
stant vigilance which keeps all Mr. La
Shelle" s presentations up to the mark,
no matter how long they may run.
"A Girl From Dixie," which scored a
pronounced success during Its New
York engagement, is to be presented in
this city at an early date. This latest
musical comedy by Harry B. Smith, the
author of "Robin Hood," "The Fortune
Teller" and other musical productions,
is said to be one of the best of the
Smith efforts. '

little likelihood of the contralto being

(Gertrude Foster), well known In the
East as a lecturer and pianist, will
give a series of four "talks" on the
music dramas of Richard Wagner,
with illustrations at the piano from the
original scores, at Lyric Hall.
Mrs. Brown has been successful as a
concert pianist, both in this country
and in Europe, but for the last few
years has devoted her time to the mu
sical lecture field, appearing before the
leading colleges, conservatories, clubs,
.etc., with such subjects as the "So

similar topics. This season Mrs. Brown
is devoting herself entirely to the
Wagner music dramas, and. her sub
jects in this city will be as follows:

Mrs. Fiske's engagement at the
Grand Opera-house, which has-been
awaited as one of the most, important
events of the dramatic season* will
begin on Monday of next week, when
San Francisco will see for the first
time Paul Heyse's powerful biblical
drama. "Mary of Magdala." This re
markable play is probably . the most
widely discussed and highly praised of
recent .stage, offerings, and is said to
have won for Mrs. Flske the greatest
triumph of her brilliant career. Last
season Mrs. Fiske presented "Mary of
Magdala" for twelve weeks at her
New York theater, the Manhattan,
and this season it had a supplementary
engagement there. It has been pre
sented with . equal success in Boston,
Chicago and In all the principal cities
of the East. The English adaptation is
the work of William Winter, the dis
tinguished cr itic and essayist, and is
of the high literary quality to be ex
pected from so eminent a, man of let
ters. ; The dramatic opportunities af
forded bv the story of the Magdalen's
regeneration under the Influence of
Christianity have been fully realized,

SAMUEL COLLINS, THE COMEDIAN-, TELLS OF FUNNY MEN'S TROUBLES.
I need not inform you, less stupid than
I. is the four-handed kind. "And were
you really the originator? But, Mr.
Collins, the best 'monk' I ever saw was
a woman'sâ Elfle Fay's."
I'm sure I don't know, only that it
was not by way of Darwin, how we
got to the comedian's family history
here. He told me that his father had
intended him for a rabbi. A double
somersault under the rabbi's reverend
nose changed his plans. The rabbi
recommended the stage, and the Collins
papa consented. There is also a brother
in the businessâ the short end of the
Collins and Hart team. Then the come
dian casually mentioned that they were
not the only celebrities In the family,
Samuel Gompers, the labor union head,
being his cousin.
"Sam's a great fellow, you know," his
cousin said. "You know, he didn't get
as much school education as I did. But
he'd get a book when we were playing,
and you couldn't get it off him. We're
pretty good friends, you knowâ the two
Sams. I'm kinder proud of him, and
he's proud of me. He's the eldest son,
and so am I, too, and whenever he's in
the town where I am he comes right
away to the theater to see me. No, I
don't know anything about his work.
Anybody that knows we're cousins asks
me about that. But I don't know any
more about unionism than that match
box," and the comedian pointed gayly
to the sacrilegious matches that stood
where Harned pearls and Held dia
monds were wont to shine.
"Mister Collins!"
Then I had a little heart-to-Â»heart
talk with Donald Brine, that more than
ever convinced me that he was growing
as young as Lillian Russell and quite
decided me that he was "lovely." He
told me a good story of his earlier salad
days, when playing with George Hi
Powers, of going to the theater and
hanging up his one uniform and mus
tache in the star's dressing-room. Pow
ers' subsequent remarks were not
the point, but the dainty little inferno
the company succeeded in creating for
the aspiring actor for the succeeding
season.
"And that's funny, too," Mr. Collins
added, as he returned.
"'Monk,' 'Monk,' Girard," I hastily
speculated. "Oh, yes, of course, I for
gotâit was great." Mr. Collins' "monk."
"Yes, and then the courts decided
that Moulan could act only for Savage.
Moulan had taken Dan McAvoy's place.
Meantime â a funny thing, too, they had
tried four or five other people In my
part without success. Then Mr.
Fisher phoned to Mr. Savage. Savage
had to use Moulan, you seeâ that he
could use a manâ that was meâ that
Savage had on his hands and to let
me go. So we all went back to base
again. How did you like the monk last
night? I done it long before Eddie
Girard done it!"
"Did you do a monk, Mr. Collins? I
missed it, then, for I went Just after
the champagne dance."
He looked at me curiously, I thought,
then said: "But that was beforeâ"
"I came In a moment or two lateâ-"
He looked pained then and said:
â¢This was at the beginning of the sec
ond act â "
We watched then the lightning archi
tecture of the stage, the building of
the second act, while the comedian
made his change. He answered me
afterward about Bernard as though we
had never been Interrupted.
"Yes, Bernard came before me. He's
great. It's a personality you know.
But I get as many laughs"â the busi
nees-Iike statement got another. "I
was a little afraid of the part, 'you
know. I knew I couldn't do it a bit
like Bernard and I told Mr. Fisher that
he'd have to let me have my own way.
They did and I made good. But I was
let out, business secrets why, after five
weeks. I went to take Frank Moulan'u
then with Savage."
"Moulan had slipped his contract I
remember â "
"Oh, Just tell me how you say 'Mar
tell,' I tried 'em with 'Hennessey three
star,' last night and It didn't go."
The artist supplied the missing pro
nunciation and the comedian disap
peared. But 'Martell, three star,' went
a3 flatly as Hennessy. Our morals will
scon be beyond suspicion.
on: "I must tell you what Alan Dale
said about me, when I first started off.
I was at Hurtig & Seamon's. It was
sure a. pretty bad bill. There was
and before me; she was a
clever little girl, but he can't drive
a truck. Well, Dale went right
through and roasted till he came to
me. Then he said 'Collins* act was
funny in spots, and black and blue in
other spots.' That was all. Ha ha!
But I wasn't black and blue."
"You have been in vaudeville most
ly?"
"Sure. But I've done everything;
I've done a Dutchman, a Hebrew,
Irish, dago. Then I was with the
'Black Crook' as Greppo for eight and
'a half months in New York, and of
course with the Dalys."
"Have you," I asked solemnly, "any
Shakespearean aspirations?"
"Me!" Collins shrieked, and I
feared for his ears as his mouth
spread gorgeously. He got up then,
hand on heart, and said: "My dear,
you flatten me! No, I have never
thought of doing Shakespeare; I don't
think I could. I don't know whether
I can act or not" â it was as much to
himself as to me that he addressed
the speculation. "Still, one must be
able to act a little to do what I do?
And â well. I can do a pretty good
French character, and a dago, too. I
don't know. One does one thing, an
other another. Schnapps is his, beer
is mine. But I love Shakespeare. I
saw Nat Goodwin in â in â vot iss?"
" "Midsummer Nij-ht's Dream?' "
"Sure; I was crazy in â¢ love with
thatâ"
Collins!" â came through the
door.
"Good-by; but won't you come on?"
the comedian invited, jamming on his
wig, and rushing on the stage.
"We followed him, to his scene with
Donald Brine, ar.d watched the little
comedian harvesting his laughs.
He returned to pdt on the professor's
disguise, feaying: "They don't liven up
on .this first scene, you know. But now,
there was places where they laughed
more to-night than they did last night.
Did you notice that new one? Just
came to me. 'Installation,' Brine says.
I say 'smallation.' Oh yes! tall, thin
gentleman, I know him well.' It's little
things like that, you know."
"Then you dp gag."
"Yes. mem, I believe you," Collins
replied. He said then, with those child
like eyes of his asking approval: "It's
according as things strike me locally.
Now last night, you'd notice I said
'North Shore railroad' for a bad one.
In New York we say the B. and O.
It lost me a laugh,' and every laugh Is
like a little piece of gold to me. I'm
going to try the Union Pacific on 'em
to-night."
That lost him another.
Then from under the corsair
mustache he had donned came the
eager inquiry: "Now, sure, you can
tell me. How did that Joke go about
the 'Japs doing a Russian business?' "
I'm afraid I said "bully!" It was the
one bright spot to me.
"What do you think?" the comedian
said again: "I got so excited at Salt
Lake City that I said 'the Russians
were doing a Jappish business!" Of
course the people didn't know what I
was talking about. But the company
did. I haven't heard the last of it yet."
"Don't the authors mind your gag
ging?"
"They may," he paid. "Some
shouldn't. The stage managers do, too,
sometimes. What do you think? We
had a stage manager â "
"Not really," I irreverently inter
rupted, for there's a good deal about
"The Silver Slipper" that suggests the
absence of that functionary.
"Oh, we have a new one now," Col
lins remarked. Then, pulling the ends
of his mustache wrathfully, he went
on: "The other fellow objected to the
gags. And what do you think he did?
He wrote 'stick to the libretto' on my
mirror, with grease-paint â my own
grease-paint. He hadn't nerve enough
to come and tell me. And I ask you
where is the libretto? Fancy a score
without a single song for the chief
comedian! 'Never had to work* is mine,
and Mr. Brine fixed up the muBic and
dance to it. Libretto!"
"Sam Bernard had the part before
you*â"
"Mister Collinsâ"
"A few," Collins owned. His mouth
â¢widened a foot or two as he went
Last week Harold Bauer and the in
finities of Beethoven; this week the
rasurne humors of Sam Collins â it's a
bis world! And it does not stretch
much farther than frc-rn Bauer to Col
lins. ' Â¦
Hiberr.ianly, it was not their period
nor the obvious and even planetary
contrast that posed the two together
for me, but their similarity of differ
ence. They are linked by a perfection
of disparity, a polar disagreement, as
black and white. It lies in their con
sciousness of hors- they do things. Half
knowledge is common with the art folk
here, a little more, a little less. Sam
Collins, delightfully, no more knows
why he is funny than Bauer could ig
r.ore the littlest milligram of his power.
His fun-making is pure instinct as
Bauer's art is most subtly conscio-us.
His effects are simplest accident, as
the pianist's are most profoundly cal
culated. He thinks with his heels, with
his electric toes, his Comus mouth, as
evidently as Bauer is thinking aloud
through his fingers. They are both
modest â ar.d arrived there by different
hemispheres. They are both conscience
possessed, though Bauer's linen wilts
through a "Walkurenritt" and Collins"
collar succumbs to a "Xever Had to
"Work." But to the week's pedalist.
Sam â everybody calls him "Sam" â
was at home to us in his dressing-room
at the Columbia last Tuesday evening.
1 had set time and place before I had
"said things" about "The Silver Slip
per." I'd just as soon, you know, not
brush skirts with a hard working little
sister that I have advised does not
know her business according to my
lights, and you couldn't miss 'em in
""The Silver Sllrper." However, the
dfed was done, and 8 o'clock found us
at the door of the "Margaret Anglin,"
the star dressing-room.
A knock brought ths terra-cotta nose
of Hensch and a plea for time to the
inch slit of the opened door. A moment
more and we were admitted. Mr. Coi
iir.s had all of Hensch on except the*
Fliegende Blatter locks. In fact our
moment's wait was not for him. A
glance round the room betrayed the
culprit. Check trews, loud vest?,
riratical locks and sombreros, and oh,
me. oh, my, the gallant frogged coat of
Donald Brine, hung where the sacred
silks and !aces of feminine stardom are
wont to 'rustle. I had that morning
accused Mr. Erineâ led thereto by the
Elim and cherubic outlines, the rather
charming backwardness of "The Silver
Slipper's" barytone â of youth. I had
further advised a kindly captivity until
grown. That I had also prophesied a
welcome for him at maturity I now
hoped would save me from the sword
that goes with his handsome uniform â
that, however, I dimly suspected was
chocolate! But Mr. Brine disappeared
.is we seated ourselves. Collins said:
"He's a lovely chap. The dressing
room is big and I enjoy having him
with me for company." *
"Will you tell me," I whispered, "Just
how old Mr. Brine is? He looks about
twenty to me â a young twenty."
"He's ," Collins replied, giving
figures that at least entitle him to some
years of respect from me.' I forgot
them, however, when the dimpled chin
and round, young eyes of Brine reap
peared. He is Incorrigibly young! II*
told me, we Ehook hands later â but
that can wait.
Mr. Collins began things by telling
me that he would like to have come out
it 1 "San Toy," as Li, a part that he
had played with the Daly company
for two years.
"You wouldn't believe how nervous
I was last night," he added. "I've
been wanting to come to San Francisco
for the last twenty years. And of
course I wanted to do well."
"We did have the Daly company here
last season," I informed, "with John
Slavin. You know him?"
"Roomed with hhn a long time back,"
the comedian said.
"I wonder if that Teas In the days
?.hen there were two collars among
three of you?"
"That It was," Collins laughed.
"There were six of us in one suite of
rooms and the first one up was the
best dressed!"
"I almost decided that you were
cockney bred last night, Mr. Collins.
To-night. I don't know â "
"You're next- Yes, mem," Collins
nodded. "And that's a funny thing, too.
I came here from London when I was
three months old. I've been back since
with the 'Casino Girl,' though, and
rubbed up on the accent. I went
there with Lederer â and that's a fun
ny thing, too. He wanted a knock
about comedian. I was one. He
didn't want to pay any price. I wasn't
it- But he took me. And at the end
of the run he presented me with a
gold watch on the stage, said I was
the hardest working comedian before
the public. Funny thing, too."
Mr. Collins slapped his knees and
looked up ingenuously. He has a pair
of eyes as attractive as any I have
seen in a human head. They're brown,
clear and deep and look at you with
the kind, uncritical gaze of a dog.
There's a Â¦wonderful wide mouth un
der them, sparse black hair over. The
Hensch nose hid the Collins feature,
but nothing could hide the prevailing
kindness of the face, not even the
wondrous thing in make-ups before
me. But his bedecked and bestrlped
figure. It would have taken an even
wiser person than his interviewer to
recognize the acrobat in the short,
rather etocky gentleman fronting me.
I had been discreetly wondering since
his performance Just how much of
Mr. Collins was not black and blue.
I said: "I agree with Mr. Lederer,
I never saw any one work harder
than you. But â doesn't it hurt?"
"Hurt? Why no! Bless your in
nocence!" Collins assured me. "Those
falls. I love to do 'em. And I don't
do half as many as I could!" â there
was humble pride here. "Of course
one shouldn't butt in with a fall only
when the situation calls for ft. But
I'd just as soon fall all night. I'll tell
you something though â and it's funny,
too: I do hurt myself falling for a
bad audience. You haven't the same

Â¦ Makaroff's ideas run counter to those
generally accepted by naval experts
and strategists. One of his pet aver
sions is armor. The admiral Is ever
outspoken in his criticism of the heavy
battleship, which, he has always con
tended, placed too many eggs in a sin
gle basket, and shows his partiality
for a. fleet composed, of a large hum-,
ber of swift, unarmored cruisers, armed
with heavy ,guns and attended by a/i
unlimited number of torpedo-boats. The
protected cruiser Novik, tj\ which he
transferred his flag. in. the attempt to
rescue the torpedo-boat destroyer, is
practically .without armor protection.
Admiral. Makaroff's predilection for
swift ships has earned. him the sobri
quet of the "Cossack of the. Sea.", He
is not likely to give the enemy much
rest while any of his cruisers or tor
pedo-boats remain afloat.

which is said to show some startling
Â«Iisfrep?.ncics in the funds of the

Whether the Warden has been short
in his accounts hap not ytt been given j

of the prison to which the V.'ardrn has> â¢

At the time of the appointment of

c-rnor Pardee objected strongly to tht,

San Quentin prison seems to be par
ticularly unfortunate with its War
dens. But a short time ago, during
the reifrn of Martin Aguirre. former

dal was revealed that startled the peo
. pie of ths State and ultimately resulted
in the dethroning of Aguirre. The
prisoners were compelled to make sam
ples of their handicraft- in the forma
of carved furniture, etc, for gra
tuitous distribution among the friends
.of Gage. A guirre's dealings were ex
posed, and the people of the State had
opportunity to learn where the moneys
appropriated to run the prison were
used to purchase supplies needed in
the manufacture of articles of house
hold furniture â¢which later adorned the Â¦

GOVERNOR YIELDS.
Th.e fight for Warden at the time
that Afruirre was ousted was between
Detective Thomas Gibson and the Oak
land politician. Tompkins was the
choice of the majority of the board,
and was championed by such men as
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf and
Frank Leach, Superintendent of the
San Francisco Mint. So much pressure
was brought to bear on Pardee by the
friends of Tompkins that he withdrew
â¢with reluctance his objections to
TompUIns, and the latter succeeded
Martin Aguirre, the disgraced co
' worker of Governor Gage. ' â¢
Major John W. Tompkins took office
on September 1 of last year. He was,
prior to his appointment as Warden
The proposed attack of the mob on
the Jail appears to have been known
to a â¢ number of citizens, but it was
understood that the intent was to treat
the criminal tir a coat of tar and feath
ers only, and there was general sur
prise this morning when it was ascer
tained that death had followed the ac
tion of the mob. The affair has caused
great excitement, both in the town and
the mines surrounding, and the action
of the Coroner's jury and other offi
cials is awaited with the greatest in
terest.
The dead negro was a stranger in
Mc-jave, having drifted here on a
freight train in the last two days. He
was a big. burly man. between 23 and
20 years of age, and nothing is known
of his antecedents.
Several shots were fired while the
lynching was in progress, but It is not
thought that these were intended far
the negro, but were rather the result
of bravado on the part of some of the
members of the mob. When it was
discovered that the negro was dead the
mob dispersed and so far there is no
definite information as tc* its personnel.
The officers have made no arrests and
all are now awaiting the result of the
Coroner's inquest, which Is now
being held. Coroner Mullins having
arrived here on information sent him
at Bakersfleld. things have quieted
down.
Evidently it was the intention of
the leaders of the mob to go no further
than to apply a coat of tar and feath
ers, and to that end there had been
provided a big pot of hot tar and a
number of feather pillows. This form
of punishment was meted out to the
negro; who continued to resist the ef
forts of his captors. â¢ His resistance
evidently angered some of those in the
mob, with the result that in the mid3t
of the scuffle the negro was either shot
in the head or struck with some heavy
instrument.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MOJAVE, March 12.â Last night
at about 11 o'clock an unknown negro
was taken from the local Jail, and,
after beingr tarred and feathered, was
either shot tp death or killed by being
struck on the head with a heavy piece
of iron.
' The negro was arrested yesterday
afternoon for a serious crime and was

The San Francisco Call. The question was brought before the
State Board of Examiners at a recent
meeting, and to-day at the special ses
sion of the Prison Directors E. S. Mel
lick, secretary of the examiners, noti
fied the board that an appropriation of
$70,000 would be authorized to keep tHe
mill going until the bags could be sold.
The law requires that no bags shall
be sold outside of the State. Manv of
fers have been made by outsiders to
purchase bags, but to no avail. To-day,
however, owing to the present emer
gency. Warden Tompkins was author
ized to dispose of 50,000 bags at 5^
cents each. This number will be shipped
to Honolulu.
SAX RAFAEL. March 12.â The State
Board of Prison Directors met in ex
ecutive session to-day to consider the
depleted condition of the prison fund.
According to the report of the prison
officials the San Quentin Jute mill Is
short over $05,000. This deficit is the
result of .the large output of grain bags,
the poor crops and the consequent non
delivery of grain bags. The output of
the Jute mill is over 18,000 bags per day
Over 6,000,000 bags were made last year!
Of this number not half were taken
from the warehouse, although ordered
and 10 per cent deposit was paid there
on. There were 1.329.620 bags ordered,
and there is yet $59,222 25 due the State
for them. At the present time there
are 3,903,500 bags on hand and no money
to run the mill.

mura, Minister of Foreign Affairs.
who has been handling the Russian-
PATRIOTISM OF JAPANESE.
"If the American people will only
look back into our history a few years
they will readily find the origin of
many influences. The educational de
partment of Japan was established by
an American. Dr. Murray; the Post
office Department was organized by
an American named Bryant; an
American established our -telegraph
service and an American named Craw
ford was the adviser of our Govern
ment in reorganizing the province-of
Hokkaido, which lies adjacent to the
Siberian boundary. In fact, in every
department of our Government there
are Americans. Large numbers' of
them are in our schools and colleges.
We, have sent many young men and
women â mere boys and girls, In fact â
to this country, where they have been
educated in your principal Institu
tions of learning, and returned to
Japan to accept responsible positions
in the Government offices.
"And why.- 1 will ask-vyou again,
should not this feeling exist? With
out Perry. Japan would not have re
ceived the blessedness of Western
civilization. With that aid we have
been able to follow you' in advancing
our nation to a position among the
powers. America is an example that
is ever before the Japanese eye. All
Ministers coming to this country have
received their instructions regarding
the relations between the .United
States and Japan, which, duriner ..the
last fifty years, have changed only _for
the better. The fruit of our civiliza
tion was reached with the influence of
America. Our power. with other na
tions is a gift from America and with
that power we are now fighting
Russia.
GIFT FROM UNCLE SAM.
"When one carefully glances at the
map of the Far East, surveys the vast
possessions of Russia and then directs
his attention to those apparently in
significant islands off the Asiatic coast,
he naturally wonders at the temerity
of the Japanese empire and probably
seriously weighs Â«the responsibilities
that she has assumed, without credit
ing her with the strengthening influ
ences that are the foundation of her
present stand against the Czar and his
mighty domain. These influences are
nothing more than the beneficial re
sults of her progress under the West
ern civilization imparted to her with
the advent of Commodore Perry.
"I have been deeply Impressed by
the turn of American opinion regard-
Ing Japan sincS'the 'present war began.
Prior to the outbreak of hostilities we
heard much In our country about the
ill-feeling entertained In yoirt- Western
country against, our people In conse
quence of Japanese immigration. On
my previous trips to the United States
I .found this feeling very strong and
frequently our Minister In Washintgon
has reported to the Foreign Office' that
the Japanese immigration In the 'West
was becoming almost too large for one
man to contend with. Suddenly Japan
severed her relations with Russia and
war was declared and then came the
news that the Americans were deeply
in sympathy with us. The very peo
ple who were decrying us a few
months ago have now shown us their
sincere friendship. And why? Be
cause they have readily realized that
we are practically the 'under dog' in
.what promises to be a terrible strug
gle. This trait Is one of the sweetest
In American manhood and one that
the Japanese fully appreciate. Â¦
To Western civilization, Inculcated
into the minds 'of the Japanese since
the memorable landing of. Commodore
Perry on the shores of the empire,
Baron Kaneka, now at the Palace
Hotel, attributes the remarkable ad
vancement of his nation as a power in
the Far East.
"To your Perry," said the distin
guished Japanese diplomat yesterday,
"wo owe a debt of gratitude that can
never be repaid unless by acts that will
show to the world, and particularly the
United States, that we, the Japanese
people as a whole, have fully merited
all the benefits that Commodore Perry's
expedition to the Orient gave us, and
that we have not only appreciated
them, -but -have materially profited by
them. It Is Just fifty years ago that he
touched at Japan, and in those fifty
years our nation has undergone a most
wonderful transformation. It was he
that . sowed the first seed of Western
civilization In our land, and from that
seed has developed, with the aid of con
stant energy and ambition, a nation
which is to-day doing what England,
France, Turkey and other great pow
ers long hesitated overâ making a de
fiant stand against, the Russian empire.
These facts I mention" simply In clear
ing away any doubt as to whether Ja
pan In Its hour "of trouble fully merits
the sympathy of all civilized nations,
and none more so than the United
States. We are not fighting simply for
the cake of war, but for the protection
of bur country's integrity and the
homes of our people â in other words,
fighting Is our last recourse. It is the
culmination of failures to obtain satis
factory settlements by peaceful means
of existing differences, dating back to
last year, when Russia made and later
violated her- promise to withdraw frdm
Manchuria and hurriedly strengthened
her position In the territory which she
had unwarrantably Invaded.
AMERICAN FEELING CHANGES.
"We do not know just how the
war will end, but so long as it lasts
the world will find Japan striving
within the bounds of international law
and humanity. The world, by the
way, has not yet stopped to consider
what the outcome of this war may
mean. We believe that we, are fight-
Ing for the peace of Asia, and, conse-
GOVEKNED BY HUMANITY.
"If we should fail in this war I am
afraid the faith of our people In Amer
ica would cease. We are a unit In the
opinion that, we are right In this strug
gle. From the highest in the land, the
Emperor, to the lowliest of his subjects,
the poor coolie, from the aged to the
child, there is but one trend of feeling,
and that is that right is "on our side,
that" we must fight on and on until jus
tice is done us. We are fighting for
principle and are governing ourselves
by international law. We have resorted
to no barbarian methods of warfare,
and none will be permitted. There have
been from time to time stories pub
lished of alleged barbarities practiced
by our military forces, but none of
them have ever been confirmed, and I
am satisfied that they are untrue. Rus
sia's methods of warfare, notwithstand
ing her boasted claims, were exempli
fied several days ago, when, after a
Japanese major and a squad of soldiers
had fallen into the hands of her troops,
they were marched through the streets
of Mukden for the edification of a lot
of Russians and Chinese and deeply
humiliated. Where was the humanity
that Russia had been boasting of? Was
that Christianity? Was it a principle ot
the Greek orthodox church, or was it a
relic of barbarism? Now contrast the
treatment accorded the Russian sailors
by the Japanese when the former were
rescued from the sinking ships after
the bombardment off Chemulpo. Our
navy men, after enforcing the custom
aryoathifrom the prisoners: that they
would not return to the fighting lines
for service, escorted them to the near
est shore, where they were released
without molestation. - J
Japanese questions In such a delicate
manner, Is a graduate of Harvard
College, and Minister Kurino at St.
Petersburg also is a graduate of the
same institution. Going a little far
ther down the llr\e of notable charac
ters on our side of the war, we dis
cover another graduate of one of your
foremost colleges In the person of the
commander of the Japanese fleet oft
Port Arthur, under whose direction
the first gun of the hostilities was
flr6d.\ Men with the learning of those
that I have Just mentioned are not
likely to make many mistakes in the
management of the war.
. ' "In every way Japan has followed
American Ideas and methods and we
are as near the type of American as
could be expected of an Oriental race.
To be sure, our color is yellow and
our stature unlike that of the Ameri
cans, but our minds and hearts are
Just the same. While studying in
your colleges the men who are now
handling many of the Important' de
tails of this war read of Bunker Hill
and they have seen Valiey Forge,
whore the Immortal Washington and
his soldiers, poorly clad and fed In
midwinter, defended their homes with
their bayonets. The same feeling
that buoyed the hopes of those gallant
soldiers exists" with, the Japanese to
day.
WHAT FAILURE MEANS.
"A strange feature of this war Is
the peaceful conditions existing in the '
cities and towns of Japan. While |
great armies are mobilizing at various i
joints and our navies are keeping our j
ports busy, the Japanese merchant and j
the artisan are performing their daily j
duties in their customary manner, as j
If the country were at peace with the j
whole world. Our Government has
not permitted its war preparations to
Interfere in any way with Its commer
cial industries, and while the* entire ;
country's future is at stake the chil- ,
dren are pursuing their studies in the I
schools as usual and the colleges are j
preparing young men for positions of {
responsibility. While our forces are â¢
battling with our great enemy on one j
side of the Pacific Ocean our commis
sioners are quietly engaged on this side
preparing for the St. Louis Exposition,
the biggest showing Japan has ever
made to the outside world of its com
mercial enterprises."
Baron Kaneka leaves for the East
to-day. He goes first to Chicago,
where he will be joined by the Jap
anese commissioner to the St. Louis
Exposition, with whom he will have ft
long conference, arid he will then pro
ceed on to New York.
PEACE IN THF. E3IPIRE.
quently. the peace of the world. It Is
a test of civilization. In so far
as Â£ we are concerned, -. for If
we should fall ' our people,
as I have already said, may lose faith
In Western civilization, and neces
earlly, in America. A defeat may also
change the views of other less civilized
peoples of the Orient, who would ac
cept our downfall as evidence of the
failure of the very methods which we
have been following for fifty years and
would refuse to encourage the further
progress of civilization in their own
countries.
"The hue and cry that has bften
raised In several a uarters concerning
the so-called 'yellow peril' seems to
me as ridiculous as a statement I read
in one of your papers the other day,
and which, I believe, was accredited
to one of your statesmen, to the ef
fect that Japan eventually meant to
gobble up Korea, and then take the
Philippines. You may rest assured
that if Japan defeats Itussfcx she will
make no attempt to acquire any ad
ditional Islands, for she has all she
can do to control those she now pos
sesses and she never has given a
thought to the possibility of some day
owning the Philippines. As for any
'yellow peril" â that is. a combination
with China, with the ultimate view of
extending her power across the Pa
cific â I will eay that we, as a nation,
are rapidly progressing toward Chris
tianity and any alliance with China of
the character that has been suggested
would never meet with the a'pproval of
the Japanese people.

Ideals in Its Strides Toward Civilization.

WASHINGTON, March 12.âInstruc
tions have- been sent from the Navy
Department to Rear Admiral Evans,
commanding the Asiatic fleet, to use
his discretion as to longer keeping the
United States gunboat Helena at New
chwang. It is understood the river is
now open and that the Helena will
be able - to gain the open sea, should
her commander so desire. The reported
intention of the Russians to sink a
junk at Newchwang in such a manner
as would not only prevent the entrance
of the Japanese,, but the egress of the
neutral men of war now there, gave
this Government an idea of the com
plications that might easily arise if the
Helena stayed.
Now that the river Is open the Amer
ican warships may - be able to go up
to Newchwang at any time, unless the
channel is blocked. At any rate, while
a state of war exists in Manchuria
American citizens will be expected to
move with more caution than during
the times of peace. This Government
is forced to recognize the fact that com
merce is practically at â¢ a standstill
there.

the -Japanese the day â¢ after the* first

the -letter says:
.'The Russian officers shared the

ST. PETERSBURG, March 12. â
General Kuropatkin, accompanied by
his entire staff, left here at 6 o'clock
this evening on a special train for the
Far East, where he will take com
mand of the Manchurian army.
The departure of the general was
marked by demonstrations of patriot
ism and personal regard such as sel
dom have been witnessed in the Rus
sian capital. Thousands of persons
who lined the Nevsky Prospect and
the approaches to the Nicholas rail
road station vied with the highest per
sonages in the empire, including the
principal military authorities, mem
bers of the Imperial Council, foreign
military attaches, membefs of the
French embassy and persons promi
nent in society, who had assembled in
side the station, in giving: vent to ex
pressions of conlidence In the new
commander who is to lead the Em
peror's army to victory.
Just a3 the general arrived at the
station Grand Duke Nicolai evitch and
the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-
Strelitz drove up and alighted.
Modestly the general drove to the*
statfon in an open carriage. He was
dressed in the fatigue uniform of his
rank. The short, imposing figure of
Russia's greatest general was in
stantly recognized by the populace and
his passage down the broad boulevard
was followed by a storm of cheers,
which grew Ioftder as the crowd grew
denser near tl. station.
HATS THROWN- ALOFT.
Here the enthusiasm broke* out in
mighty shouts, and, in spite of the
cold, the air was filled with hats
thrown aloft by the frenzied people.
The imperial waiting-rooms inside
the station were crowded with celebri
ties and the staircase leading from the
courtyard was lined by a seething mass
of picturesque uniforms of Cossack
officers, bestarred generals r and dis
tinguished naval men.
As Kuropatkin reached the head of
the stairs General. Eggresstoff, white
haired and trembling .with emotion,
began to speak. Inside and out there
was an Instant hush. ; ,v : '
"I have come to bid you godspeed,"
said General Eggresstoff. "We all
wish you a safe journey and with
God's blessing we shall come here to
greet your victorious return. Take
this small image of -Alexis, your pa
tron saint, and wear it around your
neck, and may the Almighty hold you
in. his keeping." '
General Kuropatkin knelt rever
ently and accepted the talisman. Then
he spoke in response. His few heart
felt words of thanks were uttered in
so low a tone that they were hardly
heard ten feet away. Thunderous
cheers burst forth when the two war
riors clasped each other in a.str6ng
embrace.
General Kuropatkin then stepped
forward. His strong personality was
strikingly illustrated in the way he
moved 1 through the rooms. The Czar's
aids de camp, in their handsome uni
forms, helped to clear a space in front
of the little man, whose grizzled beard
and piercing eyes suggested a re
semblance to Grant.
KINDLY GREETING FOR ALL.
The general was entirely self-pos
sessed amid â¢ the surrounding _ excite
ment and he* walked 1 easily and un
affectedly, greeting all present, em
bracing and kissing old comrades and
shaking hands with officers. He 'Â¦ did
not forget the naval ' and military
attaches, and had a kind word for
every member of v the group/repre
senting almost all ) the great armies
and navies of the world. '.French,
German, British, Italian and Austrian
attaches were atttired in a picturesque
tack the following: day smashed the
windows in the exposed parts of the
city and occasioned much alarm. The
majority of the inhabitants passed the
ensuing night in the open air.
Prices arose feverishly, bread be
came unattainable and cabmen de
manded $3 for a 15-cent ride.
Ruble notes, which hitherto have
been worth 10 per cent more than
Mexican dollars, were, at the time the
letter was sent, at par with them.

CHEFU. March 12.â The British

attack made by the Japanese, has just

ing a rainstorm. The shore batteries
did not return the tire, but the armor
ed cruiser Novik steamed outside the
harbor, firing at the enemy. The Novik
finally retired, slightly damaged. The
numerous shells which exploded in the
harbor and town did no injury! except
wrecking a house and killing a few
Chinese servants. After an hour and
# half of bombardment the Japanese
fleet withdrew. â¢
Slight Damage to the Xovlk.
Earlier In the day a deputation of
the handicraft guilds presented to
General Kuropatkin a gold and dia
mond mounted sword.
Several ladies who. were present
could not refrain from kissing the
hero of the" hour, an attention which
he gallantly reciprocated.
The general's wife, with his sons,
will accompany him as far as Moscow.
The Korean Minister to Russia, who
was present, was just as enthusiastic
as any Russian and seemed to regard
General Kuropatkin as the.savior~of
his country. ?Â¦ -He pushed and struggled
hard to get near enough to shake the
general's hand and wish him every

With Enthusiasm. â¢
Feb. 14 â China orders regular troops to. guard the frontier. Japanese cruisers capture six Norwegian colliers en route to
Russian ports.
Feb. 16 â Japanese torpedo-boats attempt to enter the harbor at Port Arthur, but are driven back. One is disabled and
afterward found abandoned on the shore.
Feb. 18 â Russian soldiers cross the Yalu and seize Wiju; on the Korean side.
Feb. 24â An attempt by the Japanese to "bottle up" the Russian fleet at Port Arthur by. sinking merchantmen in the
channel fails, four stone-laden vessels being sunk by the Russian ships before reaching the harbor entrance. Japan establishes a
protectorate over ivorea. .
Feb. 25 â Port Arthur bombarded by the Japanese fleet. Only minor damage is done on either side. ...
Feb. 26â Port Arthur bombarded for forty minutes. Some damage is done to the forts.
March 6â A Japanese division appears off Vladivostok and bombards the town, the shore batteries making no reply.
March 7 â Dalny and Port Arthur are shelled, the Japanese inflicting considerable damage upon the latter place.
March 10 â One Japanese and one Russian torpedo-boat are sunk in a battle off the entrance to Port Arthur harbor.
Afterward there is a brief bombardment of the city and the forts by the Japanese fleet.
Russia's losses to date â Cruiser Variag and gunboat Koreitz, sunk at Chemulpo: torpedo-boat Yenesei, accidentally sunk at
Port Arthur; cruiser Boyarin, accidentally sunk at Port Arthur; battleships Retvizan and Cesarevitch and cruiser Pallada, dis
abled at Port Arthur (since repaired) ; one torpedo-boat sunk and another damaged and run ashore at Port Arthur, the latter be
ing afterward floated. Known casualties â Killed, 413 men (including the crews of the Yenesei and the Boyarin); wounded, 263;
captured and paroled, 422. â¢ \
Japan's losses to date â So successful has been the operation of the Japanese censorship that these cannot be accurately given.
It is known that since the fighting at Port Arthur began three Japanese warships have been towed to Sasebo for repairs. Reports
have come from many sources that a disabled Japanese cruiser and a transport have been seen stranded on the west coast of Ko
rea. A Japanese torpedo-boat is ashore near Port Arthur. In the latest Port Arthur battle a Japanese torpedo-boat was sunk. A
Japanese official report admitted the loss of 4 killed and 54 wounded in the first attack upon Port Arthur,, but no further figures
have been given out, although a week ago a hospital ship landed 71 wounded men at Nagasaki.
The fighting on land thus far, eliminating the mass of unconfirmed. reports of engagements, has been confined to affairs of
outposts and scouting parties, and the losses have been inconsequential.
Feb. ii â Japan formally declares war. President Roosevelt issues a neutrality proclamation. The Russian torpedo-boat
Yenesei is sunk in the harbor of Port Arthur by accidental contact with a .mine. Russia's Vladivostok squadron appears in Jap

HALIFAX. N. S., March 12.â A

number of warships, it Is believed,
would fail to force an entrance. Dur

PLANS CREATION
OF A NAVY FOR
THE DOMINION
It is understood that another official
dispatch, covering Thursday's fight at
Port Arthur, has been received and
probably will be given out to-night. It
is rumored that the Russians suffered
greater material losses than reported,
but there is no confirmation of the ru
mors, official or otherwise.
speed, but the Vnushitelnl was cut oft
by a vision of the enemy's cruisers and
returned to Pigeon Bay, where she. was
followed by the Japanese, fired upon
and considerably damaged. The com
pressed air reservoir of her torpedo
magazine was pierced."
TIENTSIN, March 12.â The first credi
ble reports of the effect of the bom
bardment of Port Arthur from mid
night on Wednesday to past noon on
rhursday last which have been received
here arrived to-day. Eye-witnesses say
that the Japanese fire, which was in?
different in previous attacks, showed
marvelous accuracy. The fire came from
the direction of Pigeon Bay, where the
Russians report having sighted double
the previous number of Japanese ves
sels, and It is supposed that transports
3f various kinds accompany the fleet,
it is reported that the Retylzan, which
it is understood was then inside the en
trance of the harbor, was struck sev
aral times and that there were fatali
ties among the crew. It is also said
that the Golden Hill forts were" badly
damaged and that there were many
casualties among the remaining non
combatants in the new town, which
suffered most. One building in the rear
of the "War Bureau was destroyed, arid
elsewhere a shell annihilated 'an ''entire
family/ ,
The Russians are suppressing the cir
culation of foreign newspapers, and any
person suspected of being a correspond
ent is* ordered out-of their lines..Resi
dents of Port Arthur assert that the
defenders of that place possess the de
lusion that British officers command
the Japanese shins. A leading 'police
officer who had been prominent in ex
pelling suspects killed himself, it is're
ported, on account of his failure to ap
prehend newspaper correspondents.
BROWN GUNNERS

OF PORT ARTHUR
The engagement referred to in" the
foregoing dispatch is possibly the
same one reported from Tokio under
date of March 10, which, however,
made 'no mention of casualties.
SEOUL, Friday. March 11. â The
United States steamship Cincinnati
will leave' Chemulpo to-morrow for
Chenamphb to bring away the women
and children from the American com
pany's mine at Unsan. The families
of American missionaries south of the
Yalu are not considered to be in any
danger, but every precaution is being
taken for their safety.,
A messenger from the mines at Un
san, who left Chenampbo. on-Wednes
day last, says that everything is quiet
in ' . that 'yicl.nlty. Only a few recon
nolterine Dartiss of : Cossacks" were
seen north of that point, and there
probably were only a few hundrÂ»ls of
Russians, in all south of \.the Jalu.
There is little prospect for any seri
ous conflict in this quarter within the
ne,xt, six ; Â¦ <Â¦ . .
Thus far there has been, no trouble
at the mines and there is little like
lihood they will be/ Interfered with,
both sides having given every assur
ance In that respect. The only pos
sible danger i3 from straggling parties
of pillagers, but from these , the "min
ers are able to protect themselves,
having, on. bland three .Colt guns and
an ample supply of rifles.
An engagement . took place on the
Sth lnsti between Russian and Japan
ese cavalry, scouts near Kasangr, fifty
seven miles north of Plngyang. One
Japanese â¢ trooper was killed during
the fight. The Russians eventually
retired.
AMERICAN MINE

The report that Russia is sending
submarine boats overland to the Far
East Is much commented upon, observ
ers facetiously recalling the Russian
Emperor's proposal at The Hague peace
conference that the 'use of submarine
boats ought, to be condemned as being
uncivilized.
Count Okuma Shigenobu, former
Prime Minister," is heading a movement
for the publication in connection with
the St. Louis Exposition of a historical
work entitled "Anglo-American Influ
ence In Japan." The object is to com
memorate the fiftieth anniversary of
the negotiation of the first Japanese
treaty with the United States. There
will be about 100 distinguished con
tributors, including Prince Keiki, the
last of the shoguns; Marquis Ito and
Field Marshal Yamagata. Colonel O. E.
Woods; military attache of t,he United
States embassy, has planned to make
the work complete historically from the
time of the restoration. . â¢
| TOKIO. March 12.â Sir Claude Mac
! donald, the British Minister to Japan,
I through Admiral Bridge to-day ten
' dered the Navy Department the use of
.the naval hospital'at Yokohama' for the
treatment of sick and wounded sailors.
Vice Admiral Yamamoto, Minister of
the Navy, gratefully accepted the of
fer on behalf of Japan.
j Practically complete figures,, with
Formosa and some districts of Japan
J missing:, show that the first issue of
j 100,000,000 ysnof exchequer war bonds
t hns been subscribed four and a half
times. The subscriptions recorded by
the Bank of Japan amount to 450.000,000
| yen. This proves the correctness of the
i preliminary estimate that the Govern
! ment would be able to raise 500,000,000
! yen for war purposes from domestic
' sources.
j The Cabinet and eWer statesmen con
1 ferred for four hours to-day, They dls
! cufsod the financial situation and the
war tax measures to be submitted to
the special session of the Diet, and de
cided to raise $23,000,000 by, postponing
i Government undertakings and $35,000,
000 by a war tax. . / - , . . ,
Until recently It was thought tmprac
i ticable properly to consider and pass
rnonopoly measures at a short special
session, and it seemed to . have been
t agreed that they should be left for ac
tion by the regular session. Russia's
i extensive military programme, how
ever, makes an extension of Japan's
financial programme inoperative, so the
monopoly measures possibly- may be
submitted to the special session of the
Diet.
The condition of the wounded Rus
sians treated at the Japanese Red
Cross hospital who do not show any
unusual symptoms is thought here to
prove that there is untruth in the
Russian allegation In regard to the pe
culiarly poisonous nature of the gase
ous exhalations from the Japanese
shells and torpedoes.
The statement in the Russian report
that the Japanese used lyddite in the
bombardment of Vladivostok is be
lieved to have been made with the ob
ject of conveying the impression that
Great Britain supplied this explosive.

Dyspepsia T7U1 St Driven OS tie EartS-
The great and effective work of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is no lons-;r
confined to America. They are being
used now all over the world, for their
fame has spread throughout foreisn
countries and they cure dyspepsia in
all lands and all climates just as well
asythe'y do at home. In fatt, sur-
1*. ndlnga and conditions never inter-
fere with the successful work of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, not even
the conditions of the stomach itself.
They go ahead in their own natural
way regardless of the stomach and
digest the food that the bad stomach
cannot digest and permit that organ
to do just as it pleases, rest up. takÂ«
a vacation, get well or what not. Â¦ The
stomach, however, always makes it a
point to get well whe^n it has nothing
else to do. That's v.hat stomachs al-
ways have done and will continue to
do when they have the opportunity.
A prominent Detroit physician says:
"I prescribe Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
for all cases bf stomach trouble. I
have tried many prescriptions, lndud-
\ ing a number of my own, but find
! nothing that gives such universal re-
; lie* as this remedy. They are natural,
harmless and thoroughly effective la
their work, and while I have a natural
antipathy to patent medicines. I do
not hesitate to prescribe and recom-
mend Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets on all
occasions."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at -50 cents a. box.
They are to well known and their
popularity Is so great that a druggist
would as soon think of being out of
alcohol or quinine. The above testi-
monial of the physician Is no excep-
tion. In fact physicians are prescrib-
ing them all over the land and If your
own doctor is real honest with you ha
win tell you frankly that there Is noth-
ing on earth so good for dyspepsia as
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.

SACRAMENTO, March 12.â The an

as Postmaster of this city occasioned
little surprise. It was known that Sen

upon him as the successor of J. O.
Coleman.
Richardson, though only 35 years of
age, has beon identified with Republi
can politics in this county first as secre

the same committee. No appointment
could have been made which would ba
more satisfactory to the commercial in

Co. and has a wide acquaintance in
mercantile circles, not only in Sacra

the State. He has done splendid work
for the Republican party througn sev
eral exciting campaigns and enjoys the
reputation of being a thoroughly clean
politician. He is a native of Sacra

Gardener v.as formerly a deputy

in the rame capacity in the State of
Washington, being one of the posse
ihat k:!ied Outlaw Tracy. Gardener is
supposed to have fired the shot that
â¢vvound'-d the outlaw, which caused
the latter to commit suicide.
Spalding went up to bring Gardener
down. Gardener refused to descend and
grappled with Scalding. The insane
man tried to throw*" the attendant from
the room. When Spalding saw he could
not handle the man and v.as about to
fall he struck Gardener a blow over the
eye. rendering him unconscious. Ropes
and l'ulleys were secured and Gardener
was lowered through a trapdoor in the
roof to the floor below.

though the men would roll to the
ground, five stories below. In order to
save himself from frightful death
Spalding was obliged to knock Gar
dener unconscious.
As the attendants came from dinner
Gardener was seen standing upon the
roof of the asylum, evidently in the act
of decsending the lire escape. In some
way the patient had escaped from his
room and gained the roof.

' SAN JOSE, March 12.â H. D. Matth
ews, the newly appointed City Treas
urer, took the oath of office to-day
and will open the treasury for busi
ness next Monday morning. . The sure
ty companies that were on the bond
of McGeoghegan, the United States
Fidelity and Guaranty Company and
the American Bonding Company,
have gone on Matthews' bon8 for
$100,000. A thorough examination of
the books in the Treasurer's office
will be. commenced on Monday and
inside of a week it is said that the
total amount of the deficit, will be
known.
William Taaffe, the deputy, denies
that he had anything to do with the
shortage and his friends have retained
Attorney D. M. Delmaa to' look after
his interests. , \ '
Rumors that a warrant would be
issued for the arrest of McGoeghegan
have been current on the streets all
day, but up to this evening no action
had been taken. A private detective
is still shadowing the ex-Treasurer
night and day. The frfends of Mc-
Geoghegan are exhausting every
source to get the money to make good
the shortage. They feel confident that
they can raise the amount.
Every effort is now being made to
find where the money was spent. Mc-
Geoghegan owes a great many bills
around town and it always has been
difficult for his creditors to get any
money out of him. The police de
partment is now running down all sto
ries that come to them of McGeoghe
gan's expenditure of money. Hangers
on about the city treasury are also
being looked up and their conduct in
vestigated.
The District Attorney's office has
the matter in hand now and if there
is any prosecution it will ba through
that office.
The representatives of the two surety
companies on McGeoghegan's bond
have eerved notice on District Attorney
CamplKJll that he niust prosecute Mc-
Geoghegarr and all others found guilty
of misappropriating city fund3. The
companies declare they will not be sat
isfied with McGeoghegan's friends re
imbursing them. They state that they
are ready to pay the city the amount
of the shortage in the Treasurer's of
fice as soon as the amount is definitely
determined*. - Â¦..--.Â¦,
The city is in darkness to-nisrht be
cause electric poles are gone on the
east side. Two more breaks occurred
on that side * to-da>;, but the back
water is so high there that it gave lit
tle relief to the river. Many families
from the east side have moved to Co
lusa. Those who remain are Hying in
the second stories of houses. Stock
is being fed on the levees.
The small break that occurred on
the Colusa side near Princeton yes
terday has kept washing out until
now it is nearly 200 feet wide and is
becoming larger. The water from
this break is doing considerable dam
age to farms near the break. The wa
ter is moving south toward reclama
tion district 108 in the southern end
of the county, which contains about
35.000 acres planted to grain. The
district is surrounded by high levees
a.nd it is thought that these will hold
the water out.
COLUSA. March 12. â The Sacra
mento River reached 28 feet I'M
inches at 4 o'clock this morning and
has since receded to 27 feet 11 inches.
It is falling slowly. The water on the
east side stands nearly on a level with
the water in the river. >

Captain W. S. Overton of the Pre
sidio swore to a warrant before Po
lice Judge Fritz yesterday for the ar
rest .; of ''John Doe" and -"Richard
Roe," deputy poundkeepers, on a
charge of cr-_Mty to animals. He said
that he and his wife were driving in
a bugjry'on Van Ness avenue Fri
day afternoon and his St. Bernard dog
was following the buggy. The â¢â o
deputy "poundkeepers tried to throw
a net over the dog and he jumped out
of the bug?y and' remonstrated with
them, informing them that he-had a
license for the dotr." but they kept
throwing the | net at the ; animal, in
juring it to such an extent that it
was unable to walk yesterday.

NEW ORLEANS, March IL â General
?Jeorge Baldy, a former Union soldier,
v. ho was prominent as a Republican in
Louisiana political life during the war,
was sentenced Friday to fix months in
the penitentiary. General Baldy was
the attorney of John Spraule, a Confed

the settlement of a small estate, and ;
Tias charged with the embezzlement of ,
the proceeds. Spraule came from Call- I

HONOLULU. March 5.â The financial
condition of the Territory is such that-
Governor Carter will probably call an
extra session of the Legislature- It
has been thought that Governor Car
ter might continue- to administer the
Government on the basis of former
appropriations, the Illegality of the
county act leaving most of the depart
ments without appropriation. A test
case is now before the Supreme Court
to decide the power of the Governor
in the matter. Even if his power is up
held he can have no authority to reduce
salary expenses, which must be pruned
all along the line. The trouble has
b*en growing ever since annexation,
when two million dollars of customs
revenue went to the federal treasury in
stead of to the Territory. Expenses,
however' have been maintained upon
the former basis. Bankers have re
fused absolutely to discount treasury
warrants either for salaries or for sup
plies, and the indications are that dur
ing three or four months of tlfts year
ail Government clerks will have to wait
for their monthly remuneration. The
extra session, if called, will probably
meet during the first week In April.
Owing to the hard times the Territory
can make no exhibit at' the World's*
Fair at St. Louis.
H\WUI EMBARRASSED
BY LOW FINANCES
ill common with the business of all oth
ers, suffered by reason of the falling off
in orders. So soon as it became evident
to the directors that there was likely to
be a large diminution in the net profits
to be realized by way of dividends from
subsidiary companies it was deemed
wise and prudent to reduce the divi
dends on the common stock of this
corporation, and later for the same rea
son to suspend payment of dividends
cn this stock. In the determination of
these questions the directors gave care
ful consideration to all the facts and
circumstances bearing upon the sub
ject and due regard to the relative
rights and claims of all who are in
terested in the continuous and perma
nent success of the corporation and
the advancement of its business.
"On December 31. 1&03. the tonnage
of unfilled orders on the books was
3,215.173 tons of all kinds of manufac
tured products, in comparison with the
tonnage of 5,347.213 at corresponding
dates in the previous year."
"During the year general trade con
ditions materially changed and the
business of the subsidiary companies,
in the way of general comment
Chairman 1Z. EL Gary and President W.
E. Corey say:
â¢â¢.Since January, 1904, and up to the
date of the writing cf this report, there
have been received from J. P. Morgan
& Co. $3.*s22,900 additional on account
of the aggregate of $20,000,000 cash re
ceivable as above, and there have been
issued additional bonds of a par value
of :5 907,500. making at this date (March
1, 1S04) a total is-sue of bonds for the
aggregate principal sum of $138,000,000.
Thus the corporation has received from
J. P. Morgan & Co. for the syndicate
$11,000*000 cash and has deli%-ered SS.OOO,
000 in bonds, leaving $5,000,000 cash to
he received and $12,000,000 bonds to be
delivered."
Payments for account of common
dividends in 1&03 were $12,707,562,
compared -with $20,332,690 in 1902.
It is declared that the physical con
dition of the property has not only
been fully maintained, but greatly im
proved and strengthened by these ex
tensive outlays.
Regarding the preferred stock con
version plan, the report said:
'"Up to December Cl, 1003. there has
been issued and outstanding United
States Steel Corporation ten sixty-year
5 per cent sinking fund gold bonds,
dated April 1, 1JÂ«O3, for the aggregate
principal sum of $152,1*02,500. These
bonds were issued in payment of
1,500,000 shares of preferred stock at
par, as well as in consideration of
$7,177,100 cash received from J. P.
Morgan & Co. for a syndicate, being
part of 570,000,000 cash receivable un
der the contract of April 1, 1902. ap
proved by the stockholders in special
meeting and thereafter sustained by
tne courts.
Dividends on the preferred stock in
1903 amounted to $30,404,173, as
against $25,720,117 in 1902.
Undivided profits for 1303 were $12,
204.916. as against $34,263,656 in
1902.

COUNT LEO TOLSTOY'
PLEASED WITH BRYAN
Tayler said they had a great deal of
evidence to offer that plural marriages
had taken place since the manifesto.
There being no other witnesses, to ex
amine the committee adjourned, sub
ject to the call of the chairman.
Vancott mentioned the fact that
former Senator Rawlins - stood out
against the church in regard to Its
principles and worked against it. Judge I
Hiles corrected the statement by say
ing "certain principles." and then said
that with the qualification he had made
he regarded Rawlins as a Mormon.
Vancott attempted to take Judge
Hiles to task for his statement that
Rawlirs was a Mormon, and asked if,
as a matter of fact, his entire testi
mony was not just as reliable as his
statement in regard to Rawlins. The
witness stood his ground in regard to
Rawlins, and said that he knew what i
he was talking about, and that with the
qualifications he hadÂ» made Rawlin3
was a Mormon. He added with em
phasis that there, were no qualifications
in regard to the remainder of his tes- \
timony.
The witness said his basis for be
lieving that polygamy was more fla
grant since Utah wa3 admitted as a
State war. that more polygamous chil
dren were being born and that poly
gamists drove through the streets more
openly than before. Senator Hopkins
asked a number of questions to find
out if Judge Hiles knew whether there
had been any polygamous marriages
since the manifesto, and he said he did
not. Witness said he believed that such
marriages- had taken place. One case
he had in mind was that of a personal
friend, and he thought the plural wife
had been taken since the manifesto on
account of the youth of the woman.
Vancott asked the witness how
he accounted, in view of the testi
mony he had given, for the Mormons
sending non-Mormons to the Senate.
"How about Joseph L. Rawlins?"
be asked. "He was not a Mormon."
"Joseph L. Rawlins? Oh, yes, he
is a. Mormon."
"What â Rawlins a Mormon?"
"He was born into the church, of
Mormon parentage." . q '
"But, surely, you do not mean to say
that because a man. is born of Mormon
parentage he is always a Mormon?" -
"Pretty close to it."
In answer to other questions Judge
Hiles said he believed Smoot al
ways had taken an active part in pol
itics and had been allied with the Re
publicans, but that he never had
heard of Smoot having made an ad
dress in any campaign.
SMOOT ALWAYS SILENT.
"Yes, Governor Wells was men
tioned and Governor Thomas and
some others."
"Were there any other Republicans
mentioned for the Senatorship before
the selection of Smoot as an apostle?"
"Will you tell us why you say he
could not have been elected when his
candidacy was first announced â was
it because he had no standing in the
party?" asked Sentor Hopkins.
"He had no standing that would
entitle him to such a promotion, and
he was not seriously^ thought of," an
swered the witness.
"When it was announced first that
he was a candidate he was not an
apostle," remarked Vancott.
"Oh, well, his candidacy was not
taken seriously then, but when his
candidacy was announced after it was
known that he was to be an "apostle
it w/is certain that he would be
elected."
In the cross - examination Van
cott brought out a great deal of tes
timony regarding church influence
for the election of Reed Smoot for the
Senate and Judge Hiles stated pos
itively Smoot could not have been
elected to the United States Senate if
his candidacy had not been approved
by the Mormon church.
"Do you mean that if Mr. Smoot
had been a lay member of the church
that he would not have-been elected,
or that if he had been an. apostle and
had not tl.e indorsement of his quo
rum he could not have been elected?"
"Mr. Smoot could not have been
elected without having been an apos
tle and without the consent of the
church."
manifesto cf 1S90 he added many in
teresting details. He said there was
a disposition not to prosecute cases
when the law generally was observed,
but that after the manifesto it was
seen that the Mormons' had returned
to their old practice. He said this was
evident from the new "crops of chil
dren" from polygamous families which
continued to spring up.
The witness covered much of the
ground gone over in the testimony of
Critchlow, but in regard to the cessa
tion of prosecutions until after the
"Those people," said the witness,
"said they must obey the law of God
rather than the law of man. They
seemed to think it an act of apostasy
to go counter to the church rules, even
in obeying the laws of the land. The
cases were pressed hard, and then the
people began to obey the law, for they
were poor and could not pay the fines,
and consequently it became generally
reported that the practice of polyga
mous cohabitation was breaking up."
"CROPS OF CHILDREN."
Judge Ogdpn Hiles ef.Salt Lake, As
sistant United States Attorney in Utah
from lSSi> to 1889, in prefacing his testi
mony, said he had drawn more in
dictments and prosecuted more cases
of unlawful cohabitation under the Ed
munds-Tucker act than any other offi
cial in Utah. For the first two years
the people, he said, refused to obey the
law, despite the fact that opportunity
was given offenders to escape punish
ment if they promised not to violate
the laws in regard to cohabitation.
The witness was asked concerning a
statement in former testimony that a
Mormon committee dictated legisla
tion in the first session of the Legis
lature. He named as this committee
C. AV. Penrose, W. W. Rite, James
Sharp, William H. Kinsr, F. S. Rich
ards and James M. Tanner. Richards
was in attendance at the hearing: as
adviser for Mormon witnesses.
Van Cott asked the witness what in
formation he had as to the existence
of such a committee, and said he knew
from admissions made by George Q.
Cannon and Heber J. Grant and cer
tain members of the Legislature in in
terviews published, in April, 1SD6. He
also said he had received a letter from
Joseph Munscn, a member from Cache
Valley, giving Information as to oc
currences between Munson and Bishop
Stevens, in which Stevens said it had
been decided by the church authori
ties that inasmuch as the Legislature
was inexperienced it was best to have
a committee of the priesthood to pass
on legislation as to whether it was
proper.
WASHINGTON, March 12. â That
Reed Smoot could not have been
elected to the United States Senate
without having first been chosen as
an apostle of the Mormon church and
that after he was so chosen he would
have been defeated was asserted by
Judge Offden Hiles, Assistant United
States Attorney from 1886 to 1890 and
later a Judge of the District Court of
Utah, who was a witness to-day in
the Smoot case before the Committee
on Privileges and Elections.
An interesting feature of Judge
Hiles' testimony was. his declaration
that Former United States Senator
Rawlins was still a Mormon, even
though he stood out against the
church in the matter of interference
in politics.' Attorney Vancott took the
witness to task for the statement and
the colloquy enlivened the close of
the day's hearing.
Chairman Burrows adjourned the
session to-day subject to call. It is
expected thex-e will be a number of
witnesses here within a week or ten
days. Among those wanted are
Apostles Merrill and Teasdale and
John Henry Smith, whose alleged
plural marriages already been
recounted by witnesses.
Instances were asked for to-day in
which the church interfered in busi
ness matters in the last five years and
Critchlow mentioned the location
of a union station in Salt Lake, the
incident at Brigham City, in which the
church is said to have opposed a cer
tain amusement hall, a case before
the high council of the church, in
which the parties were Jensen vs.
Dietrich Land and Livestock Com
pany, and certain water litigation be
tween Salt Lake and the "West Jordan
canal. Critchlow's information on
the subject was indefinite and he said
he could give no competent testimony
on the subject.

cidentally asaulted Andrew Jackson,
Judge Conlan discharged about a
dozen men who had been arrested for
playing poker at the Seattle Club, in
the Baldwin annex. The place was
raided Friday evening by order of Po
lice Captain Duke, and in dismissing
the cases Judge Conlan expressed re
gret that the arrests had been made.
The police, he said, had no more right
to invade the Seattle Club, which Is a
i duly organized social association, than
they have to raid the Pacific-Union or
the Bohemian.

fore Cabaniss yesterday on a charge
of battery and the complainant was
the wife, who alleged that he had
shoved her head through a pane of
glass and knocked out several of her
teeth last Friday at the residence of
her mother, 252 Natoma street. The
case was continued until Mr. Norton
can consturct some kind of a de
fense.
According to the story told by the
officer, George was the ringleader of
a gang of boys who "guyed" a lady
vocalist while she was waf bling a
ballad about home and mother, and
when expostulated with, George be
came "sassy." Then the policeman
boxed his ears and ejected him, but
George remained in front of the the
ater and created such an uproar that
his arrest was considered. essential to
the peace of the neighborhood.
As an officer had cuffed George's
head, which he had no legal right to
do, the Judge discharged the defend
ant with a reprimand.
It was in a Broadway home of
vaudeville â¢ that George Roderegers
committed the offense for which he
was arrested and tried before Caban
iss. The complainant was a special
policeman employed to preserve prop
er decorum in the temple of amuse
ment and the charge was disturbance
of the peace.
In the court of Judge Fritz there
was on exhibition yesterday the gam
ing device by means of which Stan- i
islaus Buchek of 1010 Montgomery
street alleged he had been swindled
out of $260 by Jacob Schubener, Ed
ward Downey, Edward Gregg and
Thomas Henry on February 29' at
Bush and Dupont streets. It was a
simple-looking arrangement, consist
ing of three stuffed dolls suspended
above a wooden incline, thickly and
irregularly studded with iron spikes
and divided Into compartments at the
bottom. The game was to fling a rub
ber ball at one of the dolls, and the
compartment into which the ball
dropped after its devious windings
among the spikes called for a certain
prize.
Mr. Buchek simply wanted a box of
cigars when he began shying 'at the
dolls â 25 cents per shy â but for some
reason he failed to land a ball in the
compartment he aimed for. He was
becoming discouraged when one of
the defendants picked up a. ball and
either by phenomenal skill or extra
ordinary luck won a fat money prize
by his first shot. Thus he was tempt
ed to remain with the game and in
crease his wagers, Mr. Buchek ex
plained, until he had droopped $280,
and would have stayed longer with it
if the defendants had not suddenly
disappeared. His testimony was ad
duced through the medium of an in
terpreter and he was on the stand
about three hours. Then a continu

William Bell, the painter who threat
ened to cut the throat of former Park
Commissioner . M. Jasper McDonald,
was placed under $1000 bonds to keep
the peace by Judge Cabaniss.' The
charge of threatening to kill failed of
proof, whereas the accusation of dis
turbing the peace would probably have
resulted in conviction.
Joseph Hill, James Murray and
Thomas Brown, shabby genteel young
fellows, were before" Cabaniss on the
charge of having broken the seal of the
refrigerator car in the Southern Pa
cific yards in which they were found
concealed by Special Policeman O'Con
nor. Attorney â¢ Frank Kelley appeared
in behalf of the railroad company, and
the vigor with which he prosecuted the
case provoked mild remonstrance from
the bench.
It was shown that the three lads
had boarded the car at Monterey, had
remained in it until it arrived at Fourth
and Townsend streets, and were almost
frozen when the policeman found them.
The charge that they broke the seal
was not proved, and then Mr. Kelley
insisted that they be held for vagrancy,
but this the Judge declined to do after
he had ascertained from the defendants
that they came from the East and wer*
seeking employment. So they were dis
charged.
Peter Bargone, a teamster, had a
quarrel with a fellow workman one day
last January at North Beach, and In
the course of the dispute Peter hurled
a heavy rock at his opponent. The mis
sile flew wide of its intended mark and
caromed from the skull of an onlooker
named Reuben Curtis, inflicting a
wound so severe as to keep Reuben
confined in a hospital for a month.
When Peter was arrested and taken
before Judge Mogan he expressed deep
contrition and promised to defray all
the pecuniary expense that his faulty
marksmanship had created for Reuben,
and with that understanding he was
discharged from custody. But he failed
to keep his word, and yesterday he was
again before Judge Mogan to show
cause. He pleaded inability to pay as
per promise, but extended renewed as-'
surance that he is now able and willing
to do so. The case was continued till
to-morrow to give him ah opportunity
to make good his assertion.

DENTISTS NOT CALLED

Three American Practitioners Raise
; . an Issue Which Is Decided in
Courts i'. *& â .';
BERLIN, March .l^.-^The 9 highest
court of appeal in the German empire
has been busy with the case of three
American dentists, resident in Dresden,
who were indicted for using the title
"Dr Dent. Surg" or "Dr. Chir. Dent."
after their names on their door plates.
The German dentists in Dresden con
tended that the appearance of the title
"Dr." conveyed a false impression. â¢
Dr. Hendrick and his two American
colleagues proved that they got their
degree from a school of American
dental surgery. But the court held that
the Americans are not entitled to the
use of the title "doctor*'; that their use
of it would be deceptive, and that if
they persist in using it they must be
punished.

about $20,000. The plaintiff alleges that
at the timp Mrs. Piercy made the deed
-she was over SO years of age and feeble
in min<i and body and incompetent to
transact any business. She declares
that Edward Piercy obtained the deed
to the lan<i by means of threats, per

the deed be canceled and the property
â¢declared part of the estate and dis
tributed to the heirs, of whom the

SAX MATEO BANKS
TO BE REORGANIZED
Capital Stock Is Increased suul a Sav
ings Department Will Be
Added.
SAN MATEO, March 12.â At a meet
ing of the directors of the San Mateo
Bany Thursday it was decided to re- j
organize that institution, increase the i
capital stock and add a savings depart- |
ment. The death of Senator J. D. |
Byrnes and Phil M. Roedel left the !
positions of president and cashier va- '.
cant and these were -filled by the elec- j
tion of J. J. Fagan as president and
cashier. Mr. Fagan is vice, president
of the American National Bank of San j
Francisco, but will take an active part ;
in the management of the San Mateo
Bank. He and John H. Coleman of ;
this city were elected directors, leaving I
one vacancy on the board yet to be j
filled. The capital stock will be not j
less than $100,000 and possibly more, j
and a new brick building will be erect- j
ed to house the institution. ;
The Commercial and Savings Bank of
San Mateo is also being organized
with a capital of $100,000. A. P. Gian
nini, Andrea Sbarboro, D. W. Don
nelly, L. C. McAfee, Baldwin & Howell,
F. Levy and other prominent business
men are the projectors of this institu
tion and it seems likely that San
Mateo will have two strong, heavily
capitalized banks, where only one
comparatively small one now exists.
The new institution has opened its sub
scription books and $30,000 was sub
scribed on the first day. They, too, will
erect a brick building, and it may be
decided to make a national bank of it.

PORT TOWNSEND, March 12.â A
report from Fort Casey, received here
by wireless telegraph, states that a
small steamer was sighted this after
noon aground near Partridge Point,
Whidby Island. The steamer was
whistling: and flying distress signals.
At 3:30 p. m. the steamer was seen
from Fort Casey apparently one mile
from shore. Five minutes later she
was not in sight and had probably
sunk. The tug Sea Lion was dispatched
from Port Townsend at 4:45 o'clock arid
reached the scene of the supposed dis
aster before dark, but was unable to
find any wreckage. While so far as
known no local steamers are missing it
Is possible the Ill-fated craft is the
steamer Hope, which left here to-day
for Bellingham, Wash.
Tug Sent to the Scene of the
Disaster Is Unable to Find
Any Trace of the Craft
LATER IT DISAPPEARS
WASHINGTON, March 12.â Jacob
Fisher, the i present Postmaster at
Hastings, Neb., resumed his statement
to-day before the special Senate com
mittee appointed to* Investigate the
charges against Senator Dietrich. Sen
ator Speoner attended the meeting to
day, but Senator Cockrell was absent.
Fisher said that at the time he was
appointed Postmaster his relations
with Hahn had been rather unfriendly;
that previous to that time Hahn made
dally visits to his (Fisher's) place of
business, but that these visits stopped
when he received the news of his ap
pointment. He did not recall any visit
by 'Hahn on April 23, and he was sure
that under the circumstances he would
not have asked Hahn what he thought
erf his (Fisher's) appointment as Post
master as his (Hahn's) successor, as
Hahn had testified.
"That statement I absolutely deny,"
said the witness.
Fisher also said that he had not asked
Hahn what the office paid, and flatly
contradicted Hahn's statement that he
had asked Hahn to consult a lawyer
for him to ascertain whether he would
have to pay a note he might give to
Dietrich to secure the appointment.
"I never asked Hahn," he said, "and
no note was given."
Edwin E. Francis, deputy Postmaster
at Hastings under Fisher, was the next
witness. Replying to questions by
Platt. he said that he had agreed to
pay half the rental of a back room
of the Dietrich building and had done
so for five months, the total being $41.
The arrangement was that he would
have half of any proceeds derived from
the room. They had made an effort to
rent the room to the Western Union
Telegraph Company, but had failed.
He said these arrangements, on ac
count of the room, had nothing to do
with his salary. He contradicted the
statement of Hahn that he had as
sented to a statement that he (Francis)
had had to pay $100 to Dietrich or that
he had told Hahn that Fisher had paid
$200 to Dietrich.
IXTI3IIDATES WITNESS.
Francis testified that he. had had a
conversation with District Attorney
Summers relative to testifying before
the Grand Jury in the case of Diet
rich. ' Batty then asked for the par
ticulars of that conversation, but be
fore he could reply Senator Hoar in
terposed an inquiry as to the purpose
of the examination.
"We want," Batty replied, "to show
the pressure that the District Attorney
puts upon witnesses in these j cases;
that he told the witness that if he did
not testify he was himself liable to
prosecution and Imprisonment."
Senator Hoar suggested that such a
line of inquiry would broaden the in
quiry to an undesirable extent, and
after conversation with Senator Diet
rich the attorney temporarily with
drew the question.
Hardy Gregory, a postofflce inspec
tor, testified ! to .conversations he; said
he had had last December with Fisher
and Francis relative to moneys paid
to Dietrich on account of the back
room partitioned off from the post
office.. ..... ,.,, Â¦..
Fisher's statement, he said, was that
the original lease was to j be knocked
in the head Â¦ because of the reduction
of the rent from $1800 to $1500; that
Dietrich said he (Fisher) and the citi
zens of the place should take the fix
tures of the Grand Army of the Re
public post off his hands, but that
Fisher had said he would not ask the
people but would do so himself. After
this Dietrich had told Fisher that
when he went to Washington he would
recommend Fisher's appointment as
postmaster, although it was under
stood the appointment was in no way
dependent upon the payment for the
furniture.
TEIXS ABOUT RENTAL.
Gregory also said that Fisher and
Francis told him about the rental of
the back room, but their statements
as related by Gregory did not differ
materially from their statements to
the committtee. He said that Fran
cis had told him that. Fisher, in re
turning the rent money for the room,
had said that Dietrich had refunded
the money, saying that there had been
some comment about the transaction
and he did not. want to continue the
arrangement. These ' conversations,
Gregory said, had occurred at Omaha
at the time the Grand Jury investiga
tion into the Dietrich cafe was in
progress.
Senator Dietrich elicited statements
from the witness that a voucher which
he carried to Hastings was for pay
ment of certain fixtures and also for
the* payment of the transfer of the
Postofflce. The bids for the removal
came â¢ through the former postmaster,
Hahn.%
DEAL IX FURNITURE.
Dletrich endeavored to bring out
from the witness that if there was
any extortionate price attached Â¦ to
the removal of . the office, it was
regular, having had the sanction of
the Postofflce Department. Senator
Beveridge suggested that this was
wholly/ a .matter with the Postofflce
Department and ruled that the mat
ter was not germane.
William M. Dutton of Hastings re
lated how the arrangement with the
G. A. R. post had been made, by which
it was agreed that Dietrich should pay
the post* $500 for the fixtures. The
contract was entered Into before
Dietrich's election as Senator.
Dietrich had told him that he intend
ed to recommend Fisher as Postmaster,
it being generally understood that his
recommendation would be accepted.
The witness closed the deal between
Dietrich and â¢ the G. A. R. post regard
ing the fixtures and furniture for $500.
He then told of a conversation had with
Senator Dietrich regarding the renting
of his building for postofflce purposes,
the Senator insisting that he could not
get rent enough for his Â¦ building from
the Government. The Senator at that
time told Dutton that he thought Fish
er should take the fixtures off his
hands, but denied that he was commis
sioned to make any propsition to Fisher
and . said -. there , was no, money consid
eration mentioned for the^ fixtures.
"Dietrich told me. he would recom-
mend Fisher for 'Postmaster a week
after his election," -said Dutton.
Charles Emory Smith, the Postmas
ter General, while in Hastings in the
autumn of 1900 had recommended that
the, postoffice be changed and better
quarters secured.
John Slaker, cashier of the German
National Bank of Hastings and a
brother-in-law of Senator Dietrich, tes
tified regarding the transfer of the fix
tures and about the property being in
the name of Miss Dietrich. He said
Senator Dietrich was a man of consid
erable property and good standing ln
the community. On examination by
Senator Dietrich, the witness' said he
was to collect $1300 from the Govern
ment for the postofflce and $300 a year
from Jacob Fisher.
The committee adjourned until Mon
day.

PEEMANENCE OF CUEE.
The Chief Merit.
Many so called pile remedies will
afford the user slight, tempor-
ary relief,, and the majority 'of
sufferers do not expect more
than this. Women especially,, af-
ter having tried every preparation
recommended for the cure of Piles,
have come to the conclusion that there
Is no cure except by an operation. This
is rightfully viewed with dread, be-
cause of the shock to the delicate ner-
vous system of women, and many, of
those afflicted have resigned them-
selves to the situation with never a
thought that there fs any help in sight
for them.
We invite the attention of all such
to the experience of the lady whose ad-
dress Is given below:
"I feel it my duty to recommend the
Pyramid Pile Cure, for, after, suffering
ten years with a most distressing form
of Piles, 7 an\ entirely cured; thanks
to this remedy. Anyone doubting, this
can write to Margaret Brady. 156 "Whit-
man street, Cleveland, Ohio. 1 '
Ten months .later she writes: "I am
glad to say that I am still perfectly
free from Piles, and have not had. the
slightest trouble since I first used your
remedy. I am well known in Cleveland,
and have cu artised Pyrair.li Pile Cure
extensively here. I take pleasure In
doing so, as it saved me from an opera-
tion which I always dreaded, and you
are assured the remedy can have no
firmer advocate than I."
Tr-"nip;. A ' like this should convince
the most skeptical that Pyramid Pile
Cure not only cures, but cures to stay
cured. It is In â¢ the form of a sup-
pc=ltcry ; can be applied ln the privacy
of the home, directly to the parts af-
fected, and does its work quickly and
painlessly.

sufferers to buy a package , now and
Â£:.-e it a trial to-night. Accept no sub-
stitutes.

Special Dispatch to The Call
WASHINGTON. March 12. â There
was an echo of the Indianola (Miss.J
j Postoffice case in the Senate to-day
when Senator McLaurin rose to a
question of personal privilege to ex
plalu a newspaper report to the ef
fect that the authorities of thaf place
arrested peddlers of pictures of Pres
ident Roosevelt and Booker T. Wash
ington, who may chance to go there.
McLaurin said I that arrests of picture
venders had been made both at In
dianola and a' neighboring town, but
that the arrests were due to the fact
', that their wares were of an improper
character and not because they were
selling pictures of the President and
Booker T. Washington. .
The Senate considered but did not
dispose of the fortifications bill. A
number of bills were passed. One of
them has as its purpose the preven
tion of the desecration of the Ameri
can flag by its use for advertising pur
poses.
The Senate in executive session rati
fied the treaty between the United
States and Ethiopia, which was ne
gotiated by King Menelik (King of
Kthiopia), and Robert Skinner, Con
sul General and plenipotentiary. The
treaty was to last ten years and pro
vides for trading posts and telegraphs
and othef means of transportation in
Menelik's provinces. The main ob
jects to be accomplished by the treaty
were set* forth in an extended report
made bv Consul Skinner.
CHICAGO, March 12.â A rifle and
pistol duel through the barred door
of the structure that was the Delaware

called "Delaware house," has been bar
ricaded in the place since yesterday,

acres of surrounding land. Deputy
Sheriff Long attempted to enter the
house. Bennett greeted the officer with
two rifle shots. The deputy, revolver
in hand, answered with . two shots
through the door.
A plan was formed to set Bennett's
"castle" on fire and smoke him crut.
Word was sent to the Fire Depart
ment to be near at hand, so the- blare
might be soon suppressed. ; Before put
ting the plan into execution Deputy
Long battered down the door with an
ax. Entering, the deputy found Ben
nett sitting in the corner with three
guns. Bennett explained, that he con
cluded tcr offer no further resistance,
"seeing as the deputy was alone."

The Boston papers say that one of
the infirmities of age from which Ed
ward Atkinson, the anti-imperialist
and economist, inventor of the Alad
din oven, suffers is such unsteadiness
that he no longer uses a pen, but em
ploys a rubber stamp in signing his
name. This is done even on checks
of small or large amount. As such a
signature is not legal. Mr. Atkinson
renders it so by attesting it according
to the Bertillon system. He Inks the
ball of his thumb on a pad and leaves
the imprint on the check, as much a3
to say "Edward Atkinson,* his thumb."

THE Republican convention of Kansas not only in
dorsed President Roosevelt, but proceeded to ap
ply his sayings, his declarations of duty and his in
terpretation of citizenship Unpractical politics as. a sub
stitute for the sort of "practical politics". which is 'found
too often in the "ascendant. The application was made
in the opening speech by the chairman of the body, and
from that time 1 on became the motive of Jhe convention.
While -indorsement of the President is gratifying, a
far more enduring thing is the indorsement of his decla
rations, which will live after the voice. that uttered them
is silent. No President has furnished livelier encourage
ment to good citizenship and right conduct than he. It
may be granted that at.no time in our history has the
need of r such encouragement been greater. The minor
ity part}', having lost its. hold upon public confidence,
said its adieus to principle and picked up' expediency and
opportunism, there is a decline of the right public spirit
in many whom it still influences. The situation naturally
breeds moral carelessness in* the majority party, Vnakes
it more lax and less mindful of its greater duty. Both
parties, therefore, require a stern admonition, and the
whole people a a bugle-call to their civic duty.

POPULAR VOTE â A Reader, City.
In the United States there la, properly
speaking, no such thing as a popular
vote for President and Vice President
of the . country. The people vote for
electors and those chosen in each State
meet therein and vote for the candi

dent. A candidate may receive the
majority of the popular vote yet not
receive the electoral vote necessary to
choice, as was the case in the election
of 1876, when Tilden received of the
popular vote 4,284,885 and Hayes but

ATOKIO dispatch of Friday, the nth, announced
that Oscar King Davis, the special correspondent
of The Call from the seat of war in the East, was
one of the five American newspaper representatives who
had been given the- privilege of attending the. first Jap
anese invading column in .Korea. Of the seventy odd
correspondents from American and foreign papers who
have been waiting at the capital jfor' permission to at
tach themselves to the general corps of the invading
army but fifteen were selected to be the first in the field
of active campaigning; of the five representatives of the
American "press among this number Mr. Davis is the
only correspondent of a .paper west of Chicago.
This signal indication of the enterprise and influence
of The Call's special representative at the front confirms
the record Mr. Davis has already made as one of the
tried members of his profession. Besides that the news
of his selection to be with the first army of invasion
comes as, a guarantee that while the pother ninety and
nine war correspondents are cooling their heels at
Tokio, The Call's special writer will be sending The
Call the news from the 'battle : line on the Yalu. This
will be no more than a continuation of the success which
this paper .has had with war news since ; it printed ex
clusively the. news of the attack which opened the con
flict in the East. Â¦. v^' ."'â¢,'

Substitute for Engines.
The recent completion of a powerful
pumping plant and a system of inde
pendent hlzh pressure fire mains In
the city of Philadelphia to take the
place of horse or motor-driven steam
fire engines is noteworthy as indicating
the tendency toward centralization In
modern mechanical engineering prac
tice. While it may be too much to say
that it marks the beginning of the
disappearance of the fire engine in
large cities, nevertheless, it seems quite
clear that such, a plant can furnish
more effective protection to a given
area and that, aside from its initial
cost, it is less expensive to maintain.
The advantage to the citizens Is shown
by thft fact that for the district In
Philadelphia protected . by the new
plant insurance rates have been de
creased 15 cents per 5100 and with the
increased efficiency of the system a
further decrease of 10 cents is prom
ised.
In outHr.e the new pumping system
may he described briefly as follows:
It consists of a number of powerful
pumps driven by gas engines and lo
cated in a single building 72 by 140
feet and using an independent and
never-failing supply of water derived
from the Delaware River. This is dis
tributed under high pressure through
a network of specially constructed
mains, aggregating â¢ nine miles in
length, over the selected territory,
which includes 425 acres. The hose is
attached directly to hydrants of a spe
cial pattern and It is possible to send
four streams to the top of the highest
skyscraper in Philadelphia. The plant
is said to take the place of more than
forty fire engines and the pressure fur
nished and consequent efficiency is far
beyond that of ordinary fire engines.â

The Inevitable.
During the trial of a suit to enforce
the payment of alimony recently. In
Judge Troutt's court, a witness in the
case gave the most damaging evidence
against the defendant in the suit, once
the husband of a very prepossessing
blonde. With very great frankness he
told how the defendant had mistreated
his "wife in almost every Imaginable
way, arid haw on one occasion he (the
witness) had interfered to save the
poor woman from a beating.
"Oh, you acted the part of a peace
maker, did you?" said the defendant's
attorney when the voluble witness was
turned over to him for crosa-examlna
tion. "You rushed to the rescue of a
fair damsel In distress."
"I did," said the witness, proudly,
"and I succeeded in saving her."
"Well, well,", sarcastically returned
the lawyer, "then you did not meet the
fate commonly accredited to the peace
maker?"
"Not just then," said the witness. "I
did later. I married the fair damsel
after she got her divorce."
Pointing to the piano that was
standing in the locomotive roundhouse
of the Missouri Pacific Railroad near
Kansas City, an English visitor re
marked: "Ah, I see your road sup
plies you with musical entertainment."
"Guess not." replied the foreman.
"That piano Is for testing the engines.**
The Englishman thought it a joke,
but when a uniformed pianist struck a
note which harmonized with the noicQ
of vibration in each part of the loco
motive as it was tested, he understood
that there could be no flaws or cracks
In the engine. He was Informed that
if the noise of the locomotive made a
discord with the musical note the loco
motive would be thus proved defective.
The method has been discovered to be
more accurate than the old way of
hammering each part.â The World's

TreadwelFs Wisdom.
Several attorneys were talking, the
other day, about amusing , incidents
that happened in the criminal courts,
and one of them remarked that ex-
Judge Treadwell could be credited with
causing as many as any practitioner.
He told of one occasion when Tread
well represented a defendant in Judge
Lawlor's court who was charged" with
burglary. Treadwell was examining
the talesmen, and when it came to the
turn of one who was looked upon as a
professional juror â in other words, one
who was anxious to serve more for the
reason that he got $2 per day than
anything else â Treadwell, in his quiet
way, asked: "Do you know the mean
ing of a reasonable doubt?"
"I do," replied the talesman.
"Would you give the defendant the
benefit of a reasonable doubt?" was
the next question, and the talesman
promptly replied, "I would."
""Well now," said Treadwell, "do you
know the difference between a reason
able doubt and 52 a day?"
This unexpected sally caused a titter
throughout the courtroom and rendered
tho talesman speechless. The Judge
came to his rescue by telling him he
need not answer the question.

COOLIE LABOR IN AFRICA.
THE recent authorization of Chinese labor in the
Rand mines of South Africa, forced through" Par
liament by the powerful and wealthy clique of
Transvaal mine-owners, has called forth a storm of pro
test from almost every part of the British Empire, which
has a deeper significance, perhaps, than any other issue
ever taken by the colonies with the Home Government.
Not only do the colonials feel that the, step has ruined
the prospects of a strong crown colony in the Trans
vaal and stultified any growing loyalty which might have
been finding place in the hearts of the recently con
quered Boers, but the cry is general that the admission
of Chinese into the labor field of South Africa is a blow
at the well being of the whole empire.
"The vote is a calamity to the empire," comments the
London Daily News the morning after the passage of
the bill through Parliament. "It exposes South Africa
to the most appalling dangers and complicates the prob
lem of that country by a new and perplexing race diffi
culty. It plants an apple of division between the north
ern and southern colonies. It will probably prevent fed
eration and may lead to war or separation in the future."
Though this last prophecy of the News may be con
sidered to be inspired more by partisan rancor than calm
judgment, it is doubtless true that the introduction of
Chinese labor into the Rand will serve to stir up more
labor difficulties^ and result in greater political troubles
than the mine-owners and their party have been able to
foresee. The anti-Chinese feeling which disturbed poli
tics in California during the '70's and after will be du
plicated in the Transvaal with the added thorn of an un
certain Boer sentiment.
Since the close of hostilities down in South Africa
everything has not gone as smoothly for the sturdy Afri
kanders as their conquerors would have desired. The
readjustment of a free state into the status of a crown
colony has been attendee} with not a few worrying com-,
plications which. have not had the tendency to make the
Boers wildly enthusiastic for the British system. When
now they see the labor market cheapened and the possi
bilities of a further depreciation of this very element
which has. made for the building up of their state, the
old" spirit of independence in them is not likely to give
way to British influence any, the easier.
Another and perhaps a more grave outcome of the
Chinese labor legalization is hinted at by many of the
Australian papers â colonial distrust of the Home Govern
ment and a tendency to more liberal asseveration of inde
pendence. When New Zealand's Premier sent a circular
appeal to all of the colonies to unite in opposition to the
Chinese labor propaganda before the matter came" to a
vote in Parliament, he called for the assertion of a spirit
of union among all of the self-governing dependencies
in matters concerning the empire at large; especially
did he urge a system of brotherly co-operation in behalf
of the crown colonies. By the passage of this measure
in behalf of the rich mine-owners of the Rand the Im
perial Parliament has asserted, against the face of all
colonial opposition, its right to deal as it sees fit with its
own, willy-nilly, and thereby it has put upon the colonial
federation idea a most emphatic seal of disapproval. This
may not pass unchallenged.
'Army Transports.
BT EDWARD SI. UET7TS.
tOptain Twentieth Infantry, O. 8. A.J
(Cvpyr.tln. 1001, by Joseph B. Bow'.cs.)
For the service of transporting troops
and the supplies to maintain them be
tween San Francisco and Manila the
War Department maintains a fleet of
eight transports, of which tbe Lopan
is a good example. The maintenance of !
such a fleet has been attacked by rep
resentatives of shipping interests to
which the business would fa!l if the
transports were abolished, but a careful
Investigation has clearly shown that
the transport service not only moves
troops and supplies at much less cost
than if sent by merchant marine, but
the officers and men are Infinitely bet
ter provided for.
Brigadier Charles, Humphrey, quar
termaster general of the army, in his
last annual report presents comprehen
sive statistics comparing: the cost of the
transport service during the year with
what the cost would have been had the
service been performed by private car
rying companies, and showing that the
annual saving amounted to 52.24S.439. It
is not unusual for a transport on a sin
gle round trip to thus effect a saving of
$180,000. They are the best transports
in the world and a gratifying contrast
to the improvised ones that proved so
costly during the war with Spain.
All of the transports now sent across
the Pacific are twin screw ships, all
single screw ships being sent via the
Suez canal to New York. The reason
for this is that the course followed by
transports is one not usually used by
trans-Pacific vessels. A serious acci
dent to the engine, the breaking of a
shaft or other such serious misadven
ture would leave a single screw vessel
with its human load helpless in a situ
ation where no aid would reach them.
The transport referred t3 above is a
steel vessel 450 feet long, or, to express
it in other terms, a block and a half in
length. She draws twenty-six feet of
water, and a crew of 1SB men is neces
sary to run her and look after her va
rious departments. Forty-six steam en
gines form her equipment, divided as
follows: Two main engines that propel
her through the water at a speed of
from twelve to sixteen knots an hour,
twenty-five steam pumps to keep her
bilge clear and furnish water pressure
on board, six hoists, two capstan en
gines, three dynamos, five ventilating
engines and two to furnish power for
the ice machines. To provide steam for
and operate these various engines a
force; of sixty-two men is required.
*Â»Ixty-eig:bt tons of coal are fed into
her furnaces daily, and twelve gallons
Â«->f oil are necessary each day to lubri
cate her bearings.
This chip, like her sisters, has been
fitted up with great care and skill to
meet the many demands made upon
a troopship. Cabins for officers and
other cabin passengers are provided
and resemble those on a second class
liner. They are small, but fairly com
fortable, substantial, but not elegant,
and they provide accommodations for
a maximum of 143 passengers.
It is in the provisions made for the
enlisted soldiers that these ships espe
cially excel these of other nations. The
lower decks, divided into water-tight
compartments, are devoted to their use.
Kach compartment is fitted up with
iron, canvas bottomed bunks arranged
in three tiers, and with passageways
between. Admiral ventilating arrange
ments keep the air cool and fresh. Six
teen hundred soldiers can be cared for,
.though the number actually on board
is not often so large. Kear the sleep
ing quarters are washrooms and'lava
tories and bathrooms with running wa
ter.
A hospital with all of the latest im
provements is provided for the sick,
with a surgeon and proper attendants
to look after them. An isolation hos
pital for contagious and infectious dis
eases is also provided. A competent
embalmer is always carried on board
and the bodies of soldiers dying en
route are placed in metallic caskets,
twenty-five of which are kept on hand,
and taken to the United States.
On the mess deck Is the messroom,
where the soldiers are provided with
three hot meals each day. Their fare
is plain but abundant, wholesome and
well cooked in large steam galleys pro
vided for that purpose.
The proper feeding of the large num
ber at people of different classes on
board a transport is one of the mat
ters requiring the most careful atten
tion of skilled officers and stewards.
For this purpose all persons are placed
in various classes and assigned to ap
propriate "messes," of which there are
five.
Tu? saloon mess is for all officers,
their families and other cabin passen
gers. A charge of $1 a day is made
to all members of thl: mess, and the
regulations provide that the purchase
of supplies shall be so regulated that
such charge shall meet their cost. The
ship's officers' mess provides for tha
officers of the ship. The food for this
mess is cooked in the same galleys
and served in the same room as for
the saloon mess, but without charge
to its members. The petty officers'
mess and the crew mess are served
both fro:n the sanvj galleys, but In
different dinlrijr-rotrmsr. The troop mess
provides for all of the soldiers except
o-rtcifr. of the senior non-commissioned
officers, . v, ha are served in the â¢ petty
officers' mess.
To furnish food for so many hungry
lines of the human form. And Indian
women, whether of high or low class,
have jewels everywhere; have sleeping
gems and day gems, as we have day
and night shirts.â Everybody's Mag
azine. -
The emergency drills that are now agitating Uncle
Sam's soldiers day and night at the Presidio recommend
themselves as excellent to everybody except those that
are called to duty by sudden alarms. It is always well
to know that our defenders are ready for any call. at any
time. It encourages us and maintains 'martial blood at
the necessary temperature.
a PHILOSOPHER, sitting in the gallery of the
/\ House of Representatives at Washington, during
**. the sessions of the last three days, could have
made good use of a megaphone by aiming it at the floor
below and calling upon the members to keep cool. . The
torrid conditions that appeared were due to a report made
under authority of the Fourth Assistant Postriiaster
General, Mr. Bristow, in which free use was made of the
names of Senators and Representatives of both parties,
connecting them with the names of Machen, Beavers and
other grafters and budders in the Postoffice Department.
Be it known that every postmaster, and the commun
ity iu which he sells stamps and money orders and han
dles mail, wish to raise the grade of the/office. It means
for the incumbent more salary and enables ,the citizen to
.say to the visitor, "Yes, sir, no town in the % State more
prosperous. Our postoffice gained one grade in the last
year, sir." The influence used to increase the grade and
allowance of a postoffice is naturally the member of Con
gress for the district. The postmaster gets the people to
write to him, and he goes to the department in Wash:
ington with these letters, and usually gets what he prays
for, whether it be advance in the grade of the office, more
clerks or more clerk hire. If the Congressman do not
go on this errand when the people ask him, it goes hard
with him at the next election. It is regarded as business
in the interest of his constituents, and if he be inatten
tive to it woe be unto him.
â¢ The report attributed to General Bristow is a catalogue
of the instances in which members of Congress have
done these things, and Avhen the granting of the prayer
lay with Machen or Beavers that fact is stated in the re
port. When this was made public the face of luna be
came gory. In the" House members of both parties
broke out in oratory more or less impassioned. The
men whose names were not in the report sympathized
with those who were in it, and these uttered themselves
in the language of indignation, anger and defiance. When
a highly excited member uttered some especially scorn
ful and denunciatory sentiment both sides applauded.
The gale gathered strength as it blew, and when one
gentleman, who felt more aggrieved than the others, de
nounced Bristow as a liar and a scoundrel the applause
rocked the marble effigies in Statuary Hall.
The whole demonstration is as regrettable as its cause.
It is probable that General Bristow never saw the re
port. The secret service agents of the Government are
responsible for v this and a great many other offenses,
which should secure the vigorous overhauling of that
bureau. They are supposed to be detectives, and being
backed by the Federal Government they have the power,
and have used it, to destroy the reputation of honorable
men and to send the innocent to prison and disgrace.
When their services are invoked Cabinet officers are
powerless. The Bristow report bears the marks of their
work. It is characteristic of them to assume that every
man who came in contact with Machen and Beavers, dur
ing their sixteen years' service in the department, was
doing something wrong and must be exposed. In that
spirit, inquiry has been made by them into the advances
in grade and clerk hire and/other matters to which mem
bers of Congress, attend for their constituents, and the
whole has been published on Bristow's authority, to cast
discredit upon 191 members of the House and Senate
who have done no wrong, but on the contrary have done
exactly right in behalf of the communities they represent.
The report covers another class of cases, in which
members of the House and the Senate have owned
buildings that were rented to the Government for postal
purposes. These rent contracts- run ten, years. When
the report appeared these cases were at once assumed to
be on all fours with that of the Brooklyn Congressman
who was interested in a supply contract, and the mem
bers involved were, supposed to be under the shadow of
an indictment. But upon examination it was found that
such rent 'contracts had been made before the owners of
the property became members of Congress, and that
upon abandonment of the contracts being notified to the
department the Attorney General had decided that elec
tion to Congress subsequently to the making of such
a contract did not nullify it, and that the Government in
sisted upon compliance! This is good law and as good
sense. If a contracting party be competent .when the
contract is made, subsequent incompetency would affect
only a new contract and would not nullify the old one.
While we admit that the insinuations of the report
were infuriating and that rage was natural, yet it was
quite unparliamentary, and the dignity of the House?
would have been sustained and the judgment of the
country convinced by calm statements, in judicial tone,
putting the facts, without any dressing of epithet and in
vective. There had been no impropriety of conduct on
the part of any of the 191 members found in the drag net
of the dummy . Vidocqs of the . secret service, and that
could have* been made plain ..without impropriety of
speech.
Sam Wouldn't Get Up.
Sam Pruitt made his debut in the
1 boxing game several years ago. He
was a big colored fellow of the heavy
1 weight division and many shrewd
judges of boxing pronounced Sttttt a
second Peter Jackson and placed him
as a likely candidate for the heavy
weight championship. Sam made his
first* appearance as an amateur and
won several bouts, which boomed hia
stock. Then he became a professional.
One night at the San Francisco Club
he, was boxing a big fellow of the op
posite color. During the first two
rounds Sam showed to advantage by
pegging and jabbing his opponent
without a return. During a mix-up In
the third round the white man caught
Sam with a sweeping swing and sent
him to the floor. Referee Greggain*
stood over the fallen boxer and com
menced counting off the seconds. When
he reached eight Greggains said, "Sam,
I have counted eight, you had better
get up." *n:
"Mr. GreggainB," replied Sam, "you
can count a thousand and I ain't never
going to get up. You get that white
man there out of the ring if you want
me to get up."
mouths for such a long voyage de
mands the laying in of immense quan
tities of stores, perishable and other
wise. Certain of these, as for instance,
frozen bee? and mutton, can be replen
ished at Manila, but. in the case of
many arilcien. the return voyage must
also be provided for.
Fifty thousand pound* of fresh beef,
2000 pounds of fresh pork, a ton of
veel and mutton, and 2500 pounds of
miscellaneous fresh fish are among
the food items loaded at San Fran
cisco. Twenty thousand pounds of
!neÂ»Â» pork will be baked with 5000
pounds of beans for consumption be
fore th"Â» return voyage Is completed.
ThrÂ«Â»6 thousand pounds of bacon, 2000
pound* o* corned beef and 2500
pound? of rice are among the smaller
Items of ataplia. 'Forty-flve thousand
pounds of potatoes and 10,000 pounds
of onions form the fresh vegetable
part of the soldier's rations. Three
quarters of a ton of tea is carried on
board and the coffee weighs more than
three tona. Seventy-five thousand
pounds of sugar, 1S00 sacks of flour,
7000 pounds or cabbage and 3800 cans
of tomatoes complete the list of ar
ticles from which the food of the
larger moesee Is prepared.
For the saloon and ship's officers'
messes some finer stores are laid in.
Of these the following may be men
tioned; Eijrhtcsn hundred dozen eggs,
-OCQ pounds cf butter, 1500 pounds
of sausage, 2800 pound3 of poultry,
COO rounds of game, 200 boxes of ap
ples, two barrels of cranberries, S00
cans of cp.ch kind of fruit and vege
table, 2000 pounds each of carrots
and turnips, 1000 pounds of sweet po
tatoes, 500 pound3 of pumpkins and
COO bunches of celery- One hundred
gallons of fresh milk and thirty gal
lons of cream, carried frozen in ten
gallon cans, is used between San Fran
cisco and Manila.
To care for this large amount of
perishable stores four large cold
storage rooms are kept in constant
operation. The meats of all kinds and
fish are kept solidly frozen. The po
tatoes and onions are kept at a tem
perature of 4 8 degrees, other fresh
vegetables at 36 degrees, and fruit at
40 degrees. Once a day the cold
storage rooms are opened and a d*ay's
supply, as called for by the stewards*
requisitions, is taken out. Though each
transport has an ice machine, 2500
tons of ice are loaded before sailing,
and ice is manufactured only when
that supply is exhausted.
The voyage to Manila is a long one,
lasting from twenty-five to thirty days,
and it would prove more tedious than
it does if employment of some kind
were not provided for the soldiers. As
far as possible the same routine is
followed on board ship as in garrison.
The usual roll-calls, beginning with
reveille, are held, twice each day the
men are put through gymnastic exer
cises on deck and athletic sports are
encouraged; The regular sessions of
the "post school" for young officers
are held morning and afternoon. Each
afternoon, when the weather is fine,
the band plays a concert programme,
and every morning a thorough in
spection of the troops, the sleeping
quarters and messes is made by the
commanding officer and the quarter
master of the ship.
The most interesting ceremony of the
day occurs at sunset. The troops -are
drawn up in line more or less steady,
depending upon the roughness of the
seaâ the band plays the "Star-Spangled
Banner," and, while all officers and
men not in ranks stand uncovered and
facing aft toward the flagstaff, a detail
from the guard slowly lowers the flag
and stows it away until it shall again
be given to the breeze at the dawn of
a new day.
Life on board ship for the cabin pas
sengers is largely one of indolence.
Days are spent lounging on deck read
ing or conversing, and they slip gently
by with nothing to mark one from its
predecessor or successor, the daily bul
letin showing each successive day the
ship about three hundred miles farther
along on the voyage until finally. she
drops, anchor in Manila Bay, and the
troops are taken ashore to begin a new
life under a tropic sun and surrounded
by new conditions.
and such economic questions as "irrigation, forestry, the
trusts and labor, he has furnished a complete and co
pious literature, every line of which bears scanning and
every principle stated goes to judgment fearlessly.
The example set by Kansas Republicans can be safely
followed by all the States, and even .more use may be
made of the sayings of the President. When this is done
men will'realize-in what a high sense he has been Presi
dent of the whole people! , To test this let his utterances
be read to any intelligent American, disconnected from
his name, and they will be indorsed as great and clear
statements of our proper national policy and conduct.
In these utterances the President has made himself the
platform, and it will be found very difficult to misrep
resent them to the people.

SUIT INVOLVING LARGE
SU3I FILED BY EXECUTOR
A suit- Involving $300,000 in coin of
Chile, due on a promissory note, was
filed yesterday by Guillermo Mack,
executor of the estate of the late Wil
liam Mack. The defendant in the
action is Enrique Mack. The note was
made in Paris In October. 1S9&, and
became due January 1, 1902.
It recites that for value received
William Mack advanced to Enrique
Mack the sum of 2300,000 in the coin
of Chile and that the latter promised
to pay the sum on January 1, 1902,
with interest at the rate of 6 per cent.
The value of the note in United States
coin is Jill, 037.
The note appears to be an inter
national affair! It was made in
France and made payable in Chilean
money In the Argentine Republic.
Mack died at Monte Carlo- and the
suit for the recovery of the money is
filed in California.
The speaker will dwell particularly
on the moral and religious aspect of
citizenship. In every large city in the
United States the Young Men's Chris
tian Association is making a specialty
of Sunday afternoon meetings of this
character and great succesa has at

furnish a Sunday afternoon diversion
that is both instructive and helpful.
Another of the meetings for men,
which have become one of the most
popular features of the Y6ung Men's
Christian Association, will be held this
afternoon at 3 o'clock in the audi
torium of the institution. Commander
C. B. T. Moore of the United \ States
navy will speak on "The Making of a
Citizen." It is unusual for a man of
his class and rank to address a. meet
ing of this character and a large at
tendance is assured.
The guard has had the .Krag-Jorgen
sens for several months, but as yet not
an organization has had practice with
the new arm, therefore they have only
a theoretical knowledge of what it is
capable of accomplishing. In view of
this Captains Petty and Grattan of the
First Artillery and Captains Hunt and
Vanderbilt of the Fifth Infantry are
considering a proposition of selecting
five crack shots from each of a num
ber of companies, providing them with
1000 rounds of ammunition and having
them practice at the range of Com
pany D, near San Rafael, for the pur
pose of ascertaining what can be done
with the new arm.
In connection with the new rifles It is
somewhat singular that the men have
not yet been provided with cartridge
belts, and as the old ones have been
surrendered they have no place in
Â¦which to carry ammunition except it be
the pockets of their clothes.
During the current week 1500 of the
uniforms and caps ordered some time
since will be ready for delivery.
The guard of this State finds Itself
hampered in the matter of target
practice. When it was provided with
the Springfield rifles a certain amount
was* appropriated for ammunition for
annual target practice, and it Is claimed
this amount was insufficient to supply
the necessary rounds for each man.
Now the men have been provided with
Krag-Jorcensens, and it has been as
certained that the ammunition specially
prepared for target practice costs $33
per 1000 rounds â nearly double the
amount that it cost for a like amount
for the Springfields. It is probable that
the wise heads of the guard will meet
to devise ways and means to meet the
raise.
A.M3IUXITION" EXPENSIVE.
The men of the several commands
were drilled in close and extended or
ders and examined as to their knowl
edge of the duties of the soldier, par
ticularly as to sentry and guard mount.
In addition to the ordinary line of
inquiry Major Wilhelm, who is an in
spector of rille practice on the staff of
the commander in chief, has wherever
he has been on this tour made inquiry
from each organization about target
practice and localities for target
ranges. San Francisco has no place
suitable for a range, a fact which has
been discovered also by the inspector
of small arms practice for the United
States army, as appears from the fact
that the major general of the Depart
ment of California has ordered Major
Van Vliet, Tenth Infantry, and Cap
tain Frank L. Wina, Twelfth Infantry,
to proceed to San Jose, Coyote, Sar
gents and other points to locate a suit
able place for a range. Difficulty is
experienced in many parts of the State
because of the rapid settlement of the
country and the absence of desirable
sites for ranges wlthi? reasonable dis
tance. Major Wilhelm has made a re
quest for information as to available
sites.

T. T. Burnett and W. F. Dasha
pleaded not guilty to the indictment,
charging them with substituting Chi
nese freemen for prisoners being de
ported. T. J. Dempsey, indicted with
them, was not present, owing to sick
ness, and he was allowed until next
Saturday to plead. Lee Lim, a co
defendant, interposed a demurrer, con
tending that the indictment was fatal-
John Da\-is filed a libel against
Jonas Schoenfeld, as owner of the
American bark Louisiana. He alleges
that on November 22, 1903, while 200
miles this side "of Honolulu his left
shoulder -was fractured by being
caught in the bight of the boom sheet
and that the master Instead of turning
back to Honolulu for surgical treat
ment took him to* San Francisco, the
delay costing Davis the use of his arm.
He wants 510,000 damages.
When Thomas F. Reynolds, the dis
graced postofflce clerk from Redding,
stood up In the United States District
Court yesterday for sentence his coun
sel, Charles A." Garter, made a plea
for clemency on the grounds of the
prisoner's^ youth, the fact that it was
the first offense and that the accused
had hitherto borne a good reputation.
Reynolds had pleaded guilty to an in
dictment charging him with having
opened letters in the Redding post
office and extracted money from them.
Judge de Haven remarked that were
it not for the youth of the prisoner he
would send him to the penitentiary.
He imposed a sentence of two years'
imprisonment in the Alameda County
Jail, with such herd labor as may be

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beantjr.
â¢ Nearly everybody knows that char- j
coal Is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize Its value whÂ«n taken into
the human system for tho same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; It Is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines aad carries
tnem out of. the systsa:.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
pniukir.g, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Im-
proves the complexion; it whitens the
teeth and further acts as .a natural
and eminently i^fe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
AH druggists sell charcoal in" one
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most for the
money* is in Stuart's Absorbent Loz-
enges: thcyare composed of the finest
powdered willow charcoal and other
harmless" antiseptics In tablet form or
rather in the form of large, pleasant
tasting lozenges, the charcoal being
mixed with honey. t -
. The daily use of these lozenges will
soon, tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but. on the contrary,
great' benefit.
A Buffalo physician In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal. says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Absorbent Lozenge3 to
all .patients suffering from gas in
stomach and bowels and to clear the
complexion'; and purify the breath,
mouth and throat; , I also believe the
liver is greatly benefited, ty the daily
use of them; they cost but 25 cents a
box at drug, stores, and although in
some sense a patent preparation, yet
I believe I Ket more and better, char-
coal in Stuart's -Absorbent Lozenges
than. in any of the ordinary* charcoal

The landscape by Corot which is reproduced in the next Sunday Call art supplement is
typical of a large part of the productions of the genius of the prolific poet-painter. It is one of
the best known of this famous painter's canvases, the original bringing $25,000 at public sale in
r 1881. It possesses the poetic inspiration, the refined and delicate color and the concise expression
of the essential elements of the beauty of landscape which distinguished him as the greatest land-
*' scape painter the world has yet known.
It is no wonder that the art of "orot was great. He possessed so kind and lovable a nature
thet he endeared himself to every one who knew him. "Papa Corot" was the sobriquet which men
of his own prorcssion bestowed upon him. While he was not a man of much educataion, he pos-
sessed a great fund of that native intelligence which we call common sense, and considerable busi-
, ness ability. >
His untiring industry resulted in the production of a quantity of work which is most extra-
ordinary considering his uniform success in attaining his high aim. The fleeting and uncertain
effects of light and air were seized by him and reproduced in a most limited range of values and
the narrowest possible gamut of color. With delicate grays, greens, pale violet, -yellow and salmon
tints he produced harmonies into which he threw a vibrant force by a touch of vcrmillion and a
few positive notes of brown and black.
Jean Baptiste Camile Corot was born in Paris in 1796. He received his early education in
Rouen, and became apprenticed : to a doth merchant in Paris when quite young. When a6 years
of age he began bis art studies in the studio of Michallon, and the next year entered the- studio
Of Victor Bertin> In 1827 he first exhibited in the Salon. Recognition came slowly, but by the time
he reached the age of 70 he had amassed a considerable lortune. He received a second-class medal
in 1833 and a first in 1848. In 1874 a special gold medal was struck and presented to him by his
fellow artists as a token of their esteem. He was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor in
1846, and promoted to the grade of officer in 1867. He died February 22, 1875.

Frank Eurke, who was convicted

cas sentenced yesterday to serve one

itentiary. He was arrested on De
cember 6 while trying to break open
the door of David Baker's saloon, 602
Sixth street.
Although Judge Murasky decided that
the warrants are illegal, Jean Pon. who
applied for the writ of review, did not
obtain the relief he sought for because
he*was not one of the parties interested.
For this reason Judge Murasky sus
tained the demurrer of the City Attor
ney to the petition for the writ, though
giving an opinion sustaining the con
tention of Pon's ottorney.
Judge Murasky's opinion on the le
gality of "John and Jane Doe" war
rants resultant from a suit for a writ of
review of the action of the Police Court
In issuing these warrants for the arrest
of women occupying quarters In a ques
tionable resort on Dupont street was
filed yesterday. He decides that the
warrants are Illegal In that they are a
violation of the constitutional provision
Inserted in every bill of rights, which Is
recognized as one of the strongest pro
tests against the ancient system of giv
ing great power to Irresponsible parties.
He compares them to the famous let
tres de cachet, the use of which was
one of the causes that led to the French
Revolution. Judge Murasky's opinion is
as follows:
This is an action for a -writ oÂ£ review or
certiorari to review anrt annul the Issuance of
certain warrants which do not name or de
scribe the persons to be arrested.
That .such warrants are invalid admits of
no question. Like the lettres de cachet of
unsavory fame, they might be used to fit any
person at the caprice of the officer charged
with their execution. The fact that such an
abuse of them is Improbable Is no justification
for their Issuance. The complainant who
swore to the complaints upon which the war
rants were based must have alleged the com
mission of an offense by some one and that
person should be able to describe if not to
name. The matter Is placed beyond dispute,
however, by the provisions of the constitu
tion upon the subject, a provision Inserted In
every bill of rights and always regarded as
one of the strongest protests agralnst the an
cient system of irresponsible power evidenced
by roving commissioners and lettres de cachet.
Section 19 â The richt of the people to be
secure In their persons. ' houses, papers and
effects asalnst unreasonable seizures and
searchers, shall not be violated, and no war
rant shall issue, but on probable cause, sup
ported bv oath or affirmation particularly de
scribing the place to be searched and persons
and things to be seized.
This writ must fail, however, for. the reason
that petitioner is not a party beneficially in
terested, as It Is provided In the Code he must
be to entitle him to certiorari. Upon tEls
ground the demurrer to the petition is sus
tained.

Mrs. Boyd evidently knew of the ex
istence of Boyd's first wife, for she re
lates that she and her. husband were
visited by Mrs. Hollowbush in 1897. # She
does not state the object of the visit,
but avers that before Mrs. Hollowbush
left the home of her former husband
she was richer by $3500. She" obtained
the money from the capitalist upon the
condition that she>admlt that she was
not hjs wife; that she was the wife
of Hollowbush, and that the divorce
obtained by Boyd in 1857 was a legal
and valid decree of court.
Alexander Boyd, who was a member
of the pioneer real estate firm of Boyd
& Davis, died about three years ago,
leaving an estate worth, It Is estimated,
$6,000,000. Prior to his death he deeded
most of his wealth to Jean McGregor
Boyd, his wife, and in his will left the
remainder to her and their two sons.
Jean McGregor Boyd, the California
widow, in her answer laid bare what
she claims to be a deliberate plot on
the part of a woman .with absolutely
no rights to 'enrich herself at Ihe ex
pense of the Boyd estate. In her an
swer she charges that- Mrs. ' Hollow
bush once thought so little -of her
chance to establish her claim to the
name of Boyd that for the small sum
of $3500 she surrendered her claim and
signed a document tannouncing that
6he was not the wife of the' capitalist
and for the sum named declared that
she waived all her claims.- â¢.
In regard to the early romance of
her husband, Mrs. Boyd says that prior
to the arrival of Boyd in this State
he married the woman who is now
known as Mrs. Hollowbush. They came
to California in the early fifties and
in 1857, after several years of unhappy
life, Boyd, who was then engaged In
accumulating the millions that are now
the cause of the strife between the two
women, commenced an action for di
vorce. In Sacramento, on November
16, 1857, says Mrs. Boyd, the bonds
uniting them were severed. In sup
port of her denial of the charge that
the decree was illegally and fraudu
lently obtained, Mrs. Boyd further
avers that her husband's first wife. Just
sixteen days after she became free, be
came the wife of one Mr. Hollowbush.
It was in January, 1862, five years after
the divorce, says Mrs. Boyd, that she
became the wife of Boyd. She bore
him two children, who are still alive.
WAIVTED ALL RIGHTS.
Mrs. Hollowbush claimed that in the.
early fifties she had married Boyd, and,
though admitting that he had secured
a divorce from her at Sacramento in
November, 1857,' claimed still to be his
wife on the ground that the legal sep
aration had been obtained by Boyd by
fraudulent means and that therefore
he had no right to give his, name to
another. She said nothing, however,
in her sensational petition of her own
legal right to the name of Hollowbush,
though admitting that she had. like
Boyd, contracted a second marriage.
The millions of the late Alexander
Boyd promise to furnish ground for one
of the most sensational legal battles
ever fought In the local courts. It
will be a contest between two elderly
women, Jean McGregor Boyd of this
city, who for more than forty years
was known and recognized as the wife
of the capitalist, and Margaret Hollow
bush of Pennsylvania, who claims that
she- la the widow of the deceased mil
lionaire.
Judging by the answer filed yester
day by Mrs. Boyd to the petition of
Mrs. Hollowbush for distribution to her
of half, or a widow's share, of the mil
lions left by Boyd, the contest will be
waged along lines that will show that
the Eastern claimant during Boyd's
lifetime visited him and for a small
sum â $3500 â admitted that her' rights in
the estate of the millionaire were un
certain, and signed an agreement waiv
ing any claims she might have against
his estate.
The appearance of Mrs. Hollowbush
in the Boyd litigation last year cre
ated a surprise, for It laid bare a fam
ily skeleton that had been concealed
almost half a century. As the widow
of Alexander Boyd she asked that a
widow's share of the estate of Boyd
be distributed to her, thus declaring
that Jean McGregor, who for *f orty
years in this city was known and rec
ognized as the capitalist's wife, was not
entitled to his name. . .

The secretary read a letter from
Senator Perkins announcing that he
and Senator Bard had presented a
wreath of flowers for the
funeral of Senator Hanna in the name
of the Republican State Central Com
mittee. A vote of thanks to the Sen
ators was adopted.
,The greatest enthusiasm of the
meeting was provoked by the resolu
tion indorsing President Roosevelt
offered bv Senator John F. Davis. ThÂ«
cheers that broke out when the Pres
ident's name was first mentioned were
Resolved, That we extend our aympainica to
his stricken family and that an
crj>y of these resolutions be forwarded tci
them.
Resolved, That we deplore the deatb of the
Tfon. Marcus A. Hanna. United States Senator
imm Ohio and chairman of the Nitional lie
publican Committee. His consummate abilities
as a leader of men marks his death u a gnat
loss to the Republican party. Hi-* broaJ sym
iu*thi<Â»s of heart and mtml extending to ai:
dulses of his countrymen make us realize that
the tuition has lost a statesman wlunt Â»a>Â«
counsel was always sought In its affairs.
The following resolutions in mem
ory of the late Senator Hanna were
moved by Secretary Snook and adopt
ed in -the same manner:
martyred President. Indeed, any effort ade
quately to portray his life and character, or
to express the esteem and veneration ia which
he was held by tha American people, would
be entirely futile. But this body, as the prÂ«s
ent representatives of the Republican party
in this State, is certainly Justified In fiTln*
some expression, however feeble, to tha feeling
oC Irreparable loss which we have sustained
In his untimely taking off.
Without further remarks, therefore, Mr.
Chairman. I 'desire to offer this resolution aad
to move. Its adoption by a rising and silent
vote.
. The memorial was adopted by a
unanimous standing vote.' It Is aa
follows:
Whereas, An all wise Providence, to whosa>
Inscrutable decrees we bow in grief-stricken
humility, has permitted the removal from this
life of our beloved President. William Mc-
Kinley: now. therefore, be it
Resolved. That In his life and character wÂ»
recognize all that is moat noble and worthy of
emulation as Â» brave defender of his country*
flag on the Nation's battlefields, as a wise
counsellor in tha halls of legislation, as a con
servative official in the highest position in tha
people':* silt. a3 a brilliant leader of the party
whose principles he loved and ao ably advo
eatml. ar.d as a private citizen whose char
acter was above reproach or criticism; that
in his untimely death our country, our people
and our uarty have suffered an overwhelming
loss.- anil that our grief is only mitigated by
our supreme confidence in the country he loved
and served so well, and by the hope that his
eternal reward will be commensurate with his
Kentleness of spirit, his nobility of character
and .the -unselfishness of purpose which ever
characterized and dominated his earthly life.
It would not be appropriate that we should
at this time, attempt any extended eulogy
unon^ the .character..; ajad 'aervicfia al our
Mr. Chairman: Since ttie last meeting 'of
this organization' an unspeakable calamity has
befallen . our country, and our people in the
removal from this life, by the , dastardly hand
of a assassin, of the chief executive
of the nation, the great and sweet-souled-Will
iam . McKinley. ' .
All the sections having been passed
seriatim, C. M. Belshaw moved that
the call, as amended; be adopted as a
whole. This was carried. Senator R.
N. Bulfca of Los Angeles thenVnoved
a -memorial upon the death of
ident McKinley, saying in support of
his motion: . .'Â¦ â¢
was raised for its adoption. The sen
timent of the committee was well ex
pressed by Senator - Davis, who said :
, "It would be most revolutionary for
us to arrogate to ourselves the power
proposed, by the amendment. The
Republican party does not want any
manor set of men to dictate its rep
resentation. Primary elections are
not mandatory in all the counties. In
the smaller counties the draft rightly
leaves the manner of selecting dele
gates to the county committees. ' This
is- simply horse sense. If the' public
pressure is worth considering the
county committees will consider it,
for their members well know that if
they ; do not they will . lose their
heads."
After the defeat of Prior's amend
ment the sections of the draft were
passed without further objection until
the : apportionment of delegates was
reached* Hocking of Stanislaus asksd
why the former rule allowing each
county a delegate at large had been
departed from and argued that the
Interior of the- State was thus de
prived of part of Us rightful strength
in . the 'convention. â¢ Chairman Hayes
ruied that the primary election law
required the delegates to be elected
by- the - several . Assembly, districts,
rather than by the countiesfas such.
: Judge H. C. Dibble was the next to
propose a- change in the draft. He
moved to strike out from the twelfth
section the words "and file the nec
essary petition â in ""accordance with
law," which, .he .declared, made the
section an attempt on the part of the
State Central Committee to dictate to
the Congressional district committees
that they /must- order; primary elec
tions. Judge Dibble's amendment
was also lost after several members of
the executive committee had pointed
out that the section as drafted was in
line with the* primary election law
j and did not invade ' the legitimate
; functions of the Congressional dis
trict committees. The vote against
the "amendment was almost unani
mous? '

Republicans will open the political
campaign in California on Monday,
May 16. The executive committee of
the State League, of Republican Clubs
yesterday decided that club . represen
tatives should assemble at Sacramento
in biennial convention on that day.
Two days later . the Republican State
Convention called , to elect four dele
gates at large to the Republican Na
tional Convention will assemble in Sac
ramento.
There was a general meeting of the
State, Committee at Golden Gate Hall
in this city yesterday afternoon. The
event that evoked the greatest enthu
siasm of the occasion was the\ unani
mous adoption of a resolution declar
ing the committee's unfaltering loyalty
and devotion to President Theodore
Roosevelt and recommending that the
coming State convention pledge-its del-,
egation to the national convention to"
use all honorable endeavor to secure
his nomination. . The resolution was
introduced by John F. Davis of 'Ama
dor. -
The initial proceedings brought out
a large representation of the commit
tee membership. 'The only amendment
to the call ' for a State convention as
framed by the executive committee at
the Union League Club Friday even
ing, and published In The Call yester
day, -was the designation of Sacra
mento as the place ,of meeting. - Seer
tions of the call relative to the recog
nition of the primary election law;were
fully discussed by party leaders and
the judgment of the executive body was
sustained. With reference .to the se
lection of. delegates .to represent the
several Congressional districts . in ' the,
national convention the letter and spirit
of the call of the Republican National
Committee -were respected. ) Congres
sional committees will have a free hand
to act in their own capacity. â¢ /..; :
â¢ The amendment provoked a short,
sharp ;debate, in. the. course of which
the' executive; 'committee's draft 'was
supported by Senator John ;F. Davis
of Amador, Judge J. W. McKinley of
Los Angeles, Charles H. Spear of Ala
meda and T.'C." Hocking of Stanislaus.'
The only speaker in r: favor " of " "the
amendment was A. Â»B." . Truman of the
Thirty-eighth Assembly^ District, and
when the vote was taken not a voice
When. the. fourth paragraph of the
draft was reached an amendment was
offered by John L. Prior of the Thirty
fifth District, San Francisco. This sec
tion, as drawn, provided that; In coun
ties, where the Code sections calling for
primary elections are jj not ; obligatory
and mandatory , the delegates to . the
State convention may be appointed or
elected in such manner, as shall be de
termined by , the respective ; county
committees. Prior, moved that this be
amended so as, to -give the power of
appointing the convention; delegates
from each 'Assembly district" to the
represents tive- from that" district . in
the State' Central Committee.
CHOICE OF DELEGATES.
After the reading: of the call of the
National 1 Republican Committee the
acting chairman introduced the real
business of the meeting by saying:
"At a session of your, executive com
mittee held last evening the form of
a call for the meeting of the State con
vention was agreed upon. It will be
read by the secretary section by sec
tion, and unless objections are made
to any section when read that section
will be held to be approved.'*
The draft of the call, which was print
ed in yesterday's newspapers, was then
read, and after some discussion was
adopted with * a single ' amendment.
This was the insertion of- the name of
Sacramento in the blank left for the
place of meeting, which was adopted
on motion of ex-Senator' E: C. Voor
heis of Amador County, "seconded by
Harbor * Commissioner.; Charles H.
Spear. '
the unavoidable, absence of Chairman
William M. Cutter. Mr._ Hayes brief
ly stated the object of the meeting
to be the formulation and adoption of
a call ! for the Republican j State Con
vention/ and directed the calling of the
roll by Secretary Charles E. Snook of
Oakland. The roll showed seventy
members of the State Central Commit
tee and nearly every one of the mem
bers of the executive, committee to be
present in person or by proxy.-
Shortly after the meeting opened
Abraham Ruef entered and presented
the proxy of Supervisor L. A. Rea.
A ripple of laughter, swept over 'the
committee on Ruef's appearance, but
nonobjection to his presence was made
and he took no part in the proceed
ings beyond voting^ on all the ques
tions" submitted.

THOSE PRESEXT.
Among those present at the banquet
were:
Samuel Shortrldge spoke at length on
the progress of the party from its Ins
tancyâhow It had battled against the
political elements and .won otit at
every turn. He concluded his address
by saying that as long as the party is
in such good hands and so well man
aged, there is no fear but that the peo
ple will stand by it in its hour of need.
Walter Brunt sang an original song
on the political prospects of .the day. It
ran to the tune of "A Hot Time" and
provoked applause and laughter. The
meeting came to a close with the sing
ing of "Auld LangSyne" by the quartet
and three rousing cheers for the party.
General Woodruff entertained the
gathering with some original witti
cisms and was frequently Interrupted
with cheers. He told of the progress of
the flag in the Orient and wound up by
paying a glowing tribute to the Repub
lican party and the Union League
Club.
The Democratic party has given the country
free trade and free ullver. They would ruin
this vast and beautiful land with their empty
principles. We have come to the rescue with
sound money and a protective tariff; and what
is the result? We have built up a trade that
etands unequaled in the world to-day. Our
treasury is the richest in the universe; our
people are happy and - contented, and. as long
as we will give them protection and sound
money they will not forsake us.
The magnanimous McKinley brought this
condition of affairs about and' the . incom
parable Roosevelt carrier it on. The Repub
lican party Is allied with Providence, while
the Democrats are allied with, every power
but Providence.
Attorney General Webb followed Sel
vage with a. speech that showed his
confidence in the party. He said in
part:
The outlook U brighter now for the Re
publican i,arty than it has ever been be
fore. We have made the country in the last
four years. We have built It up and given
the people prosperity. We have protected the
farmer, the manufacturer and every good citi
zen in every walk of life. And now, after
all that we have done for the people, do you
think they will go back on us next November?
Never. Rest assured that they will stand by
us In th* coming campaign and fight for us
till victory ts assured.
We have bec-n recognized the world over by
the crowned heads of empires and kingdoms
and by magnates and kings of finance in
every section of the globe. We have become
a bower which the world looks upon and re
spects. Klnrs and Emperors wait till they
have beard from John Hay at Washington
before they attempt to take any Important ac
tion. Our strength Is recognized. V.'e are
feared and respected and our power will in
crease as the years and the days roll by.
PROSPERITY FOLLOWS.
We must stand for the Republican party and
its principles. If any of us has a slight differ
ence or a misunderstanding with his fellow
Republican* he must forget It. We will have
to fizht man to man and arm to arm and
when the time comes we will be numbered
among the banner States and rive to our
standard bearer a majority of 50,000 votes
and then the world may look upon us as Re
publicans who can and will fight for their
party and their principles to the last.
We want good p and abie men to lead the
party to victory â men who are not afraid to
set into the thick of the fight and fight to
the bitter end. We have them in this town,
In this Slate: In fact, we have them In every
tewn end in every State. I know that they
will get. in and work as they have never
worked in their lives to achieve a victory that
will be a record ' breaker, one that will "put
the Democrats down and out and leave them
in a predicament that they will not recover
from in the. next decade.
But to do this we roust all stand together.
San Francisco la no longer an outpost, but
the grand gateway Into and out of which the
greatest ships on earth sail and she Is only
keeping pace with the Republican party.
Senator Thomas H. Selvage of
Humboldt provoked round after round
of hearty applause ere his aggressive
speech was half completed. The Sen
ator sounded the battle cry to his fel
low clubmen and cautioned them
against allowing their wily foes, the
Democrats, to steal a march on them
at an opportune moment. In the
course of his remarks Selvage said:
Bear in mind, fellow clubmen and fellow
Republicans, that the Democrats are not
asleep and that they are only looking for a
chance, an opportunity, to steal a march on
you and bulldoze the people with some of their
empty eayings and more o f their empty teach
ings and doctrines. We will have to stand
prepared for them and meet them In the field
of battle, prepared to administer a -crushing
defeat â one that they will remember and one
that will be a credit to the State and to the
Republican party.
Bryan has been their leader for the last
eight years. Now he Is dead and gone and
we will not be troubled with him any more.
But then we Â»il! havp to be on the alert, for
there will be other leaders only too ready to
take the place of their crestfallen chieftain
and endeavor to lead their disorganized party
to some kind of a victory. They will leave
nothing undone, they will overlook so trick,
and therefore I caution you. gentlemen, to be

trees, tourists and Republican majorities grow.
I law the wonderful, fertile fields which had
been changed from arid sands to fruitful
farms, and the population of which had grown
bo marvelously under the Republican regime.
And It Is growing still, and the greatest pros
perity is showing upon our land. We have the
banner, and I hope- to keep it there, but I
imagine we will hare a harder fight during
this election than at the laÂ«t one. The ques
tion of the party is not of the past, but of
the present and tho future. Let the Demo
crats prate of Jefferson and Cleveland. We
don't want to talk of the pastâ we want to
be oj> to date.
, We have MacArthur, Chaffee and Taft. all
grand men. who have made the name of this
country respected at home and abroad. We
have a fixed cistern of principles. We are not
seeking and groping around In the dark. We
know what our platform is. What Is the plat
form of the Democrats? Who cares about It
anyway?
Judge McKinley of Los Angeles spoke
of the Republican party. His remarks
were frequently Interrupted with laugh
ter and applause. He said in part:
The Union League Club Is the outcome of
political circumstances. It had its birth
practically durir.j the James G. Blalne cam
paign. A lot of young men, at that time the
flower of the Republican party, started in to
do what they could in their own way at their
own expense to help alone the cause. They
called themselves the Dirigo Club and went
into active campaign work. They were of
sreat assistance at that time and traveled
from one end of the State to the other.
The second year of its formation an invita
tion was extended to the plder members of
the Republican party to join it and the re
sult was the founding of the Union League
Club. It is the first social Republican club of
this city. It first started In rooms on Oary
street, then moved to its present quarters here
In the Palace and soon Tee are to move into
the magnificent elubrooms now occupied by tho
Pacific-Union Club.
We have entertained three Presidents â Har
rison, McKinley and Roosevelt.
At present we have 652 members. I am
for putting up financial bars, as I think unless
we do the club will grrow too fast. This Is a
Republican social club to maintain the prin
ciples of the national party.
Let all work In peace and harmony for the
success and development of the Union League
Club.
M. H. de Young was called on to say
something about the Union League
Club. He said in part:
HISTORY OF THE CLUB.
We must all etand together, and we will
have such a victory that we will feel proud
we are not only Republicans but Caltforniana.
The quartet then sang a humorous
selection, "Oh, Lucky Jim."
The Republicans know thÂ«r duty to the Re
publican party and they intend to do it. We
owe a duty to the party and a duty to our
selves. The leader is already selected and in
his selection the issue is already before us.
President Roosevelt stands for everything that
Is foremost in the Republican party. His ad
ministration has been progressive and at the
same time eafe. Although an Easterner by
birth, lie is filled with the spirit of the West.
He represents the Republican principles of the
Republicans of this State. With such a
leader and with such -issues to back him, can
there be a better man to further the Interests
of this State? Do away with petty jealousies
and stand loyally for the success of the Re
publican party. We will get Democratic sup
port with Theodore Roosevelt at the head of
our ticket.
J. O. Hayes of San Jose spoke on
"The Obligations of California to the
Republican Party." He said in part:
will make the campaign as brilliant and
strong as was the campaign of the Immortal
McKinley.
After considerable discussion wheth
er there 'should be only short
speeches at the convention or quite a
number of brief talks and a limited
number of set speeches, a motfon was
madÂ« to refer the subject to a com
mittee on programme. On motion of
H. C. Dibble, seconded by A. B. Lem
mon, the president of the league was
authorised to name a committee of
five on platform and a committee of
three on programme. The president
of the league Is required to serve on
each committee.
It Is expected that the citizens of
Sacramento will provide a hall for the
convention and make the customary
arrangements for "the entertainment of
delegates. There are indications that
a large number of visitors will be In
Sacramento throughout the week be
ginning May 16.
The president asked for an expres
sion of opinion regarding the time and
place of holding the next convention.
The fact was cited that the State con
vention of the Republican party would
be held in Sacramento on "Wednesday.
May IS, and it was suggested that the
league convention should meet at 2
p. m. on Monday. May 16. and adjourn
on Tuesday nisht. May IT. The sug
gestion was put in the form of a reso
lution and adopted on motion of O. A.
Hale.
It was decided that each Republican
club of the State should be entitled to
one delegate for twenty-five en
rolled members, and that club presi
dents and secretaries be ex-offlclo del
egates. The representation is the same
as that adopted two years ago, when
the call for the San Jose convention
was issued.
The executive committee of the Call*
fornia League of Republican Clubs
held a meeting yesterday afternoon at
the Union League Club and resolved
that the next biennial convention of
the State league should be held in
Sacramento on Slay 16 and 17. The
session of the executive committee was
attended by Lieutenant Governor Al
den Anderson, president of the organ
ization; Felton Taylor, secretary. Jos
eph Spear, Charles M. Belshaw, Harold
T. Power, Thomas H. Selvage, O. A.
Hale, S. C. Smith. Henry C. Dibble
and A E. Lemmon,
The opening of the Republican cam
paign was celebrated by the members
of the Union League Club and their
friends at a banquet in the Palace Ho
tel last night. Covers were laid for
more than 200, and enthusiasm pre
vailed from the moment Colonel Pippy
.read President Roosevelt's message of
regret at being unable to be present
until the last speaker concluded his ad
'dress and the long drawn notes of the
.orchestra signified that the feasting
and toasting' had ended.
Â¦ It was a notable gathering and the
feeling of the Republican politicians of
the State toward the administration
was clearly shown. Veterans such as
Jacob II. Xeff rubbed elbows with the
younger men who are about to throw
all their virile energy into the coming
â¢ * ampaign and the name of Roosevelt
always elicited spontaneous outbursts
of applause.
â¢ 'olonel George H. Pippy was a clever
t<'ustmaster and a better selection of
.-peakers could hardly have been made.
Whilf in the main the responses were
j-^rinus 1 , dealing with questions of grave
import to the nation, there was a su/fl
< )<nt sprinkling of wit and humor to
keep all in happy mood. The actions
<f President Roosevelt and his
straightforward policy in matters of
state were commented upon favorably
and tender references were made to
the party leaders who have passed
from this earth since the last campaign
âPresident William McKinley and Sen
ator Marcus A. Hanna. At the close
rousing cheers were given for the Pres
ident, the party and its workers, and
the gathering broke up, each man de
termined to do his best to make the
coming campaign the most vigorous
in the history of the country.
HOXOR TO ROOSEVELT.
"When the time for speechmaking ar
rived Colonel Pippy read the following
telegram from President Roosevelt:
"Many thanks for the telegram. I re
member well my last meeting with you.
Sorry I cannot be with you. My regards
to alL"
This was received with great enthu
siasm and ringing cheers for the chief
executive. Colonel Pippy followed by
reading a telegram from William M.
Cutter, chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee of California.
It ran as follows: "I regret exceedingly
that circumstances beyond my control
prevent xny presence at the club ban
quet to-night, but consider me with
you In spirit and as heartily Joining in
the toasts to our beloved President,
Theodore Roosevelt, and to the grand
party which he will lead to certain vic
tory in the coming campaign." Colonel
Pippy then announced that the speak
ers would each be allowed ten minutes,
as the list of talkers was a long one.
He referred to the Union League Club
as being Bolld for the Republican ticket
from top to bottom, and said California
was cure to keep her place in the right
lines. He then proposed 'the toast
"Theodore Roosevelt, th* "President of
the United States," and called upon
Governor Pardee to respond. The Gov- ;
ernor received an ovation as he arose.
He said in part:
I feÂ«l k i eatly honored at being naked to
r r l 'Â¦: to this toast, but I fear I am In no
way equal to the task of dolnr honor to the
createst man In the world to-day. (Great
. heertne.) MTÂ»n j I learned that President
Hf-OBevelt was coming to visit this ftÂ«tfÂ« I
felt some trepidation in meeting him, but dur
frs the time he was Â»n California I was with
him tea or twelx-e dayi and I had every op
portunity to know him well. At flirt I ad
mired hiia Â£s the worthy chief executive of

us all ri*e to do honor to his name: to the
most di*ttnr--2ished fcnan of our day and to the

When the cheering had subsided tha
Union League Club quartet sang "The
"Star-Spangled Banner."
WORK THE WATCHWORD.
The subject of "ThÂ» National Cam
paign" was handled by Judge W. C.
Van Fleet. He said in part:
I win rive you a brirf outline of some buc-

Resolved, In accord with the sentiment of the Republican State Committee of his native. State of New York, this committee hereby declares its unfaltering loyalty
and devotion to President Theodore Roosevelt As the organization representing his party in this State, we are grateful for his devotion to Republican principles; we take
pride in his exalted ideals of citizenship; we acclaim the high statesmanship of his administration; we admire the career of a leader whom cunning cannot defeat, flattery
cannot cajole and power cannot coerce. No scheming of craft anywhere shall defeat our hope that he will be renominated and that he will be triumphantly elected President
of this Nation. We recommend that the coming State Convention pledge its delegation to the National Convention to use all honorable endeavor to secure his nomination.

After a spell of splendid work with

day for Los Angeles, where he will
dispatch the fields for the next four
weeks. Dick Dwy.er will resume >work

Sidney Bender will ship Lord Mel

to Bennings the cc/ming week.
George Mountain, who has made an
enviable record in the saddle at Los
Angeles, will give the racegoers here
an opportunity to judge of his ability
at Oakland to-morrow.
C. Smith and "Big Bill" Knapp each
put two winners over the plate.
Billy Magrane now makes the en
gagements for Jc-ckey Bullman. The
latter has settled down to business and
will be a big factor in the saddle from
now on.
Garnet Ferguson- has disposed of Sir
Appleby to E. Tierney. The colt's wind
is touched and Garnet grew weary of
tinkering with him.
Charley McCafferty claimed The Ha
waiian out of the second race for $725.
Jc-hn <Â«x>dg;e, trainer of the colt, in
turn claimed Fair Lady Anna on Mc-
Cafferty for the same amount.
H. D. Beams, the colored owner,
leaves for Detroit to-morrow, " where
he is to appear at the trial of Farley
who "runs" the" mare Aimless as
Sarah Black last summer. Beams is
the principal witness for the Western
Jockey Club.
Admitting that Pinkerton was for
a time pocketed, Bullman, in order to
set a good position, rode Arisbe
through the deepest going on the far
turn for fully 100 yards. This cer
tainly about equalizes things.
Many looking: from an angle sup

the bend for home was reached The
Mist had had enough and "Amy J had
opened up a lead of over two lengths
over Arisbe and to all appearances
was simply galloping.
ARISBE IN THE LEAD.
Pinkerton, the flower of the Schreiber
stable, was shipped up here from Los
Angeles expressly to capture the race,
but the colt was suffering from a cold,
discharging mucous from his nose, and
this fact caused a slump in his mar
ket price until 8 was offered. Peggy
O'Neil, Meada'and Salable looked
slightly outclassed.
No great line could be drawn on the
qualifications of Amy J, she having
won but one race. That one public ap
pearance seemed to convince all that
she was a stake filly, though, and when
3 to 2 .was chalked about her yester
day the* crowd snapped at it like a
trout in fly time. Of the other seven
starters The Mist opened with second
call at 3, but receded to 5. and from
the latter figure the odds against Arisbe
were forced down to 4.
It was the first two-year-old stake
of the season and attracted ' a large
half-holiday, crowd, the presence of
Pinkerton. the L,os Angeles crack, im
parting a refreshing flavor and in
fusing something of the old-time feel
ing of sentiment into the, race.
The relative qualities of the three
young misses, Amy J, Arisbe and The
Mist, had been, much discussed and
especial interest was centered in their
meeting. It was a crucial test, for
the condition of the track and the dis
tance, five furlongs, made it a, moral
certainty that only the fittest would
survive. Then again the intrinsic val
uation of the stake was not to be
sneezed at, for of the gross valuation,
$3140, the winner annexed J24S0.
AMY J ISJ FAVORITE.
At the heels of Arisbe followed
Barney Schreiber's great black colt,
Pinkerton, with Jimmy Boland in the
saddle, and Bose Eley, one of the Blas
ingame^entries and a shifty youngster
himself^ beat the favorite out for show
honors.
The winner raced through the heavy
and cuppy going with a dogged deter
mination worthy of her stout lineage
and was faultlessly piloted by John
Bullman, probably the premier rider
of two-year-olds in this country.

second choice, and Brown Study. The
former won by a slight margin. Peggy

JohnyMcGurk was made favorite at

respectively, and Mistletide 100.

trailed Nitrate to the stretch and then
forged ahead, leading by two lengths
when straightened out for the finish.
She looked to be a winner, but Booker
brought Lacy Crawford up with a rush
and nipped her by half a length.
Barney Schreiber's horses came near

followed by Ostrich, and It was a two

up a gap which Ostrich only succeeded
in closing as they rounded the stretch

a drive all through the stretch and at

Atkins had a world of speed and wor

the rubber. But he was shy on com
mand and could not locate the plate at
the critical moment. Besides, he hurt
his finger in the first inning and this
interfered with his pitching. This aft

With two men on the bags and the
score 3 to 2 in favor of the college men,
Walter Nagle tore off a two-bagger to
the right, field fence that brought both
men in. Then followed a bombardment
that was awful. Every man on the Pre
sidio team got jerry to the kind that
Parker was passing out, and hit after
hit skimmed through the infield and
away out to the outfield. In all nine
men made the circuit of the bags and
eight of them hit safely.
Parker then Quit the box and went
out to center field. Atkins came, from
behind the bat and went into the box,
Elston going to the big mitt and. Marty
Murphy to Eecond base. The change
was all right for a while, but in the
eighth round the soldiers attacked the
offerings of Atkins, and aided by four
baseÂ»-xÂ»n balls and a bunch of errors by
Keifer scored seven more.
The college tossers were all in after
the fourth inning and never had an
other chance. Nagle was steady
throughout, and his support grew bet
ter as the game incVeased with age,
Elston was the star on the alumnr
team. He soaked out two safe hits and
played a great second base, besides per
forming well behind the bat.
The ball tossers in blue who represent
the Presidio turned another trick yes
terday afternoon on their own grounds.
The Stanford-Berkeley alumni were the
victims for the second time within a
few weeks, and the score was 18 to 3 â
the biggest that has yet been piled up
by "Wagner's aggregation.
As usual, the place was well filled
with officers, soldiers and fair repre
sentatives of the Presidio, who did
nothing but yell for the men in blue.
For four innings it was a beautiful
game. Then the soldiers began to take
long and fast rides on the offerings of
Paul Parker, the former Stanford star,
and. then it was curtains.

The. reply concludes as follows:
With all France's prosperity lamen
tations are being raised over the decay
of the home-made lace industry, which,
says a correspondent, if matters go on
as they are going now, will be a lost
art in France. It is pointed out that
half a century ago there were still over
50.000 dentellleres in the department of
Calvados alone, who earned their 40
cents a day. In Auvergne there wore
more than 100,000, while Lorraine reck
oned 'half that number. Now there are
not 2000 of such lacemakers in the
whole of Normandy, and Auvergne and
Lorraine can only show 10,000. It
is to the imitatipn trade, with
its machinery, that the mischief is to
be attributed. Out of fifty Parisian
establishments which once gave em
ployment to the women of a single
rural district, only three have survived.
It seems strange, in an age so luxurious
as this, that the passion for real lace,
of all things, should â¢ be numbered
among the has beens. Promoters of a
movement to restore the industry, with
the aid of the Minister of Commerce,
are appealing to fashion to help them
out. But they have powerful rivals in
the manufacturers.â Boston Herald.

Japan pleads that the charge against
her seizure of Russian merchantmen
before the declaration of war cannot
stand after the establishment of the
prize . court. Their seizure after the
declaration of war, being piracy, is not
defensible by. the establishment of, the
prize court, which cannot exist befc^
Japan's denial of malicious Interfer
ence with the transmission of Russian
telegrams over the Danish cable can
nut be sustained.". A telegram to Baron
de Rosen, then Russian Minister ta
Japan, at Tokio, sent from St. Peters
burg on February 4, was not delivered
until the morning of February 8. That
delay did not occur on the Siberian
line, as shown by the fact that a reply
to a telegram from Viceroy Alexleff
sent at the same time was received the
same day. Therefore it Is conclusive
that De Rosen's telegram was held by
the Japanese and not delivered for two
days.
Communication with Pavloff, then
Russian Minister to Korea, by the Ko
rean telegraph ceased in the middle
of January. As the Koreans were en
joying friendly relations with Russia,
there is good ground for believing that
the interruption was due to the Jap
anese. Thereafter Pavloflf used a mall
steamship or a special warship to com
municate with Port Arthur. The Min
ister of Russia in Korea on February S
therefore knew nothing of the diplo
matic rupture. \ .
ST. PETERSBURG. March 12, 2:50
p. m. â The following reply, inspired by
the Foreign Office to Japan's rejoinder
to the Russian protest against the vio
lation of â¢ Korean neutrality, may be
accepted as official:
Japan's argument that she was justi
fied in landing troops in Korea, before
the declaration of .war, because she had
Korea's permission, and also that these
troops -Arrived in Korea after "the ex
istence of a" state of war," is -without
value, as Korea in January promul
gated her neutrality to- the powers,
which received it warmly, Great Brit
ain even officially conveying expres
sions of gratitude to the Korean Gov
ernment. Therefore no state of war
gave the Japanese the right to violate
her neutrality by sending troops into
the territory. Even the consent of Ko
rea, though extorted by the Japanese,
is without force, from the fact that
the dispatch of troops was not only
before the war, but before the breaking
off of diplomatic relations, as clearly
established and Indeed acknowledged
by the Japanese themselves.
Japan's contention, in defense of. the
attack on the Russian ships, at , Che
mulpo, that the port was not neutral
is false again, because Korea had pro
claimed her neutrality.
The new town sustained the greates.

The pame was played in the mud,
the recent rains having left the links
in anything but good condition. The
greens were sodden and the drives
carried with them all the mud which
could be pasted on the sticks, making
it necessary for those who followed
the players in the finals to keep at a
good distance to prevent being be
spattered.
The game was featureless except for
itÂ« length. Swift led from the start
and the players were so far apart that
interest was divided among the spec
tators, of whom there was a large
crowd. Fairbanks made a spurt,
however, toward the last and- closed
the game with a narrow score. He
was favorite among those who wit
nessed the game, which experts stated
was hardly a fair trial, considering
the- condition qf the ground.
LOS ANGELES, March 12.â In one of
the longest drawn out games ever
played even by amateurs, the Pacific

the Santa Barbara Country Club. He

. Following are the day's results, with
Judge Thomas Tlerney's official scores:
H was a great day for the talent at
Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday.
Hardly a short end raised a flag, and
the pikers had nothing but hard luck
etories to tell.
While the class was hardly up to the
standard, still the greyhounds were so
evenly matched lhat they furnished
lively sport for the spectators. To pick
the winners would be hard work, and
th<Â» wise ones are guessing as to the
ultimate results.
Corbett was bubbling over with good
nature and was particularly pleased
when he sneaked in some unexpected
upper'cuts which sent back the head
of his sparring partner with a snap.
Corbett gave out his weight as being
136 pounds. The fat is commencing to
melt off and the muscles are showing
under his smooth white skin. As usual,
his gymnasium was thronged with
visitors.
Britt's programme yesterday con
sisted of a trot on the road in the morn
ing and two hours of fast exercise in
the gymnasium in the afternoon with
the bag, the skipping rope and In wres
tling with Rafael. When it was all
over Jimmy was in a healthy glow, and
after being rubbed down and cooled off
he withstood a battery of cameras for
ten minutes. To-day a large delega
tion of Britfs friends from the Olym
pic Club will make the pilgrimage
across the bay to feast their eyes on
Jimmy in action.
Corbett seemed to be. of the same
mind as Britt yesterday, as he did an
immense amount of wrestling with
Billy Otts. It was rough work, and
there were several butting matches in
which the heads of the athletes came
together hard. Otts came in head
down to save himself and on one oc
casion hurt Corbett, the knees of the
little champion shaking. under the im
pact.
That -Jimmy Brltt expects Young
Corbett to rough it in the clinches in
their coming contest within the roped
arena Is evident from the time the
Callfornian devotes to pulling and
pushing his trainers about in his pre
paratory work at Croll's Gardens in
Alameda. During the last week Britt
has done little sparring, but he has
hauled and hugged Spider Kelly and
Frank Rafael until they, imagined they
were in the. tentacles of an octopus. ,
Britt has observed his next oppo
nent in several fights and figures that
the tactics used by the Denver boxer
when fastened to his man are wearing
and Jimmy promises to checkmate such
usage If Young Corbett essays to try
it on him.

AT THE CITY'S CHURCHES
The talent secured for the evening
performance at the Mechanics' Pavilion
is of the highest order, and therefore
The coming celebration of St. Pat
rick's day in this city promises to be
one of the" most interesting and enter
taining that has ever taken place here
in 'honor of Erin's patron saint. The
programme that has been arranged by
the executive committee is .a varied
one, and while not long fits the occa
sion admirably. * .
There will be a wide departure from
religious services this year. The com
mittee decided to hold a celebration of
mirth and merriment, and allow the
Irish people to observe the religious
part of the occasion aa they saw fit.
Nor v.ill there be any official oration at
the exercises. Michael Casey, chairman
of the evening, will say a few words,
and that will be all.
Bert Murphy, a singer of national
reputation, will render some old Irish
melodies during the evening entertain
ment at the Pavilion. Mr. Murphy ar
rived in this city from the East a short
time ago and since has been prominent
ly identified with, all the well-known
Irish societies and clubs.
the programme should prove to be ar
tistic as well as interesting. .It contains
six numbers, and all those who are to
appear are well known In this city and
elsewhere as entertainers of ability.
One of the features of the programme
to be srlven at the Presidio grounds in
the afternoon is the fancy Irish dances
by the well-known Instructor, John J.
O'Connor. -O'Connor is a member of the
Ancient Order of Hibernians, Knlghta
of the Red Branch, Gaelic Dancing
School and a prominent athlete. He
will. entertain the audience with some
novel Irish ster>s and will appear in
costume.
TWO PROMINENT ENTERTAINERS WHO WILO APPEAR AT ST.
PATRICK'S DA,Y EXERCISES. WHICH WILL BE HELD ON THE
AFTERNOON AND EVENING OF MARCH 17.
John J. O'Connor and Bert Murphy, Entertainers
of Renown, Will Lend Their Services for the
Occasionâ Religious Exercises Are Abandoned

Thc Blind Man's Whistle.
In Japan the blind carry a peculiar
kind of whistle, which they blow v as
they pass through the streets, and
people who hear it separate and leave
the pathway clear for them. There
are a great many blind persons in
Japan, and if they were to employ. the
makeshift of a child or dog :to lead
them there, would be numerous com
plications in the narrow streets. When
heard in. the dead:of night the "blind
whistle" has an especially pathetic
and mournful sound. â Golden Penny.

These earless and tailless cold stor
age rats are perfectly at home in a
temperature below the zero mark. They
thrive on wintry atmospheres, and very
probably if they were driven out into
the vrarmth of a heated room they
would suffer a great deal and perhaps
many would perish,
j "This, I think," gays a writer in the
Atlanta | Constitution, commenting on
the phenomenon, "is ore c-f the most
striking examples of how the animal
kingdom in the. wise economy of nature
can adapt it3elf to the most severe sur
roundings."âNew York Commercial.
When cold storage was first intro
duced into this country the chilly stor
age rooms were absolutely free from
rats and mi^e. The temperature was
kept considerably below the freezing
point and in the cold surroundings
rats and mice were unable to live. y
In time, however, the rich stores
packed away there proved too tempt
ing for thieving rodents and they be
gan to make inroads into the cold
storage rooms, at first paying a hur
ried call and as soon as they haC taken
a few nibbles rushing with a shiver
out into warmer places.
Gradually, however, these visits were
lengthened and became more frequent,
not without considerable mortality
among the rats, but In the end there
grew inter being what is known as the
"cold-storage rat." This animal has
neither tail nor ears, both having been
frozen for his ancestors, resulting in
their total loss to the families of the
first intrepid pirates of cold storage.

"The work was evidently much read
in England, as it went through two
editions in the course of six years â Â¦
the second edition appearing in 15S6
â so that, having regard to its char
acter and popularity, there Is nothing
surprising in the assumption that
Shakespeare in some way becams ac
quainted with its contents."
Certainly he would have found in it
a "picture of Italian manners, cere
monies, customs, occupations, foibles,
dress and thought of the day" â a
storehouse of information for a play
laid in Italy. Sir Edward Sullivan
givea quite a long series of parallel
isms between Shakespeare's writings
and Pettie'a translation of the "Civile
Conversation." The play of "Hamlet"
alone supplies eight cases of remark
able "similarity of thought and mod*
of expression." and, as Sir Edward
remarks, "We are aware with wh:it
freedom 'Shakespeare utilized the cur
rent literary material 'of his d \ " â
London Chron'.cle.
Sir Edward Sullivan. Bart. write3
in the February Nineteenth Century
of a "forgotten volume in Shake
speare's library" â that is to say, of a
book which Shakespeare seems to
have known and used largely in his
writing, however little the fact has
been noted. It Is one of extreme rar
ity and the opening part of its till-*
runs as follows:
"The Civile Conversation of M.
Steeuen Guazzo, written first in Ital
ian and nowe translated out of French
by George-Pettie, divided into foure
bookes."

BERKELEY, March 12. â Miss
Blanche Bertheaud crushed her left
hand in a frightful manner this morn
ing while chopping kindling wood at
her home, 1731 Milvia street. In at
tempting to split a stick of wood she
struck the hand that held it with an
ax. The ax was dull and instead of
making a clear cut crushed four of the
metacarpal bones.
So heavy was the impact that the
splinters of the bones were forced
through the flesh. The sight of the
wound and the pain caused .Miss Ber
theaud to cry out and by the time the
members of the family had responded
she was lying in a swoon on the floor.
Dr. J. T. Farrar was hurriedly called
and he mended the bones as well as
their sniintered condition would per
mit. Miss Bertheaud is a student at

WASHINGTON. March 12. â The
House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce to-day began a
series of hearings to determine' the
character of legislation for the gov
ernment of the canal zone on the
isthmus of Panama.
Rear Admiral Walker said he be
lieved that work on the canal couM
be begun in two or three months.
The liquor question was injected
into the discussion by a remark of the
admiral that the principal revenues
would come from licenses to eating
houses and saloons.
Speaking of the class of labor that
it would be necessary to employ la the
construction of the canal, Admiral
Walker said that the blacks from Ja
maica were the best fitted class ob
tainable in the vicinity of the canal
zone. But there were not enough of
those laborers, and coolie labor from
China and Japan would have to bo
brought over for this work. He esti
mated that the maximum number of
laborers nesried would bÂ» somÂ» 35,
000. Other persons who would come
with these laborers would increase
the population of the zone to some
â¬5.000.

BERKELEY. March 12.â The Berke
ley High School nine defeated the
Boone's Academy team at baseball this
afternoon at Freeman's Park, the score
being 12 to 11. In the last half of the
ninth inning, when 'the score stood 11
to 10 in favor of Boone's, Sollnsky of
Berkeley batted out a two-bagger and
brought in Shaffer. The umpire of
bases called Shaffer safe, but the um
pire at the plate declared that he had
been put out by Ihe catcher, and a dis
pute arose. In the meantime Solinsky
"sneaked" in. making the score 12 to
11. Boone's men are dissatisfied with
the result and will protest the game.
Preparatory School Nines Dispute.
TWO SOPHOMORE GIRLS
WHO ASSISTED IN ENTER
TAINING SENIOR SISTERS.
The men were wise enough to stay
away, all except the janitor, and what
few dogs showed up were sent howl
ing. So that after all the entertain
ment, whatever turn it happened ' to
take, went on without disturbance or
guffaws from the rude fellows. \
It was really one of the prettiest af
fairs of the year. From a certain
"Fophie," who slyly passed the news
along afterward, it was discovered
that "Miss Head's kindergarten" was
â¢in session some part of the afternoon.
Miss Phoebe Binney- and Miss Sue
Ross were the teachers and all the
other "sophie" girls primary students.
The class sang all the "ring" songs
in its repertoire and between times the
aforesaid "stunts" were done by the
Misses Ann Thatcher, Hazel Hobson,
Franklyn Jones, Grace Stokes, Sophie
Trcadwell, Bertlne Wollenberg, Edith
Busser and Ina Titus.
"After the class had. been dismissed
the "sophles" refreshed the seniors
with a dainty luncheon and after that
they danced* The hall was decorated
with red, the class color, and carica
tures of a lot of well-known student
people decorated the walls.
The affair was in charge of the fol
lowing committees:
Entertainment â The Misses Bertlne Wollen
berg, Isabel JJcJteynolds, Ann Thatcher, Grace
Stokes Gertrude Frledlander, Sophie Tread
well.
Refreshment â The Misses Phcebe Binney.
Ruth Wllklns. Hope, Wricht, Mayer ani

Uecoration* â The Mlrsen Marian Morrow,

BERKELEY, March 12. â "For dogs
and boys there won't be room."
That was the "beware" sign that
kept the men away from Hearst Hall
thi_ afternoon while the sophomore
girls were entertaining the senior girls
of the university. And that suggests
another question: Why did the girls
mix the dogs and the boys up in the
same sentence? And why did the girls
want to warn these two noble animals
away? Was it because they consid
ered the "stunts" too awfully awful
for the sight of man and even brute?
Any way, the "sophie" girls set out
the "scarecrow" in verse and between
the lines he who runs may read. For
instance, one of them says, "We're to
have an exhibition to beat those of all
tradition." That indicates that there
was need for the warning legend. But
here is the way the whole thing reads
on the invitations that were sent out:
We're to have an exhibition
To beat t!ioÂ«e ot all tradition.
Our teacher says '<>< can come,
And that "00 will f relic seme.
So Just be dressed and wait till two.

OF TOUTUIUNG HOUSE
OAKLAND, March 12. â T. C. Lane,
the Southern Pacific brakeman that
created a disturbance in the offices
of Division Superintendent Palmer at
the Oakland mole last week and
threatened A. W. Baker, assistant su
perintendent, with a pistol, is again
in the toils of the law and is schem
ing how to get out. He was let go
last week on condition that he would
get out of town. He went to Stockton,
but returned to Oakland a few days
ago and was rearrested.
He was taken before Justice of the
Peace Quinn this morning and pleaded
that he had been drinking heavily,
but that if given another chance he
would not trouble the Southern Pa
cific officials any more. His bond was
fixed at $5000 and his case put over
until next Wednesday. In the mean
time it is believed that arrangements
can be made for his release.
Lane had his hand crushed while
switching some cars last summer and
the arm had to be amputated. H>e has
been drinking a great deal since, but
when able to go to work was given a
position at Tracy as switchman. At
the end of the month he was given
considerable less pay tha he thought
was due him and coming to Oakland
went down to the mole and raised a
disturbance.
The officials believe that he means
to do them harm and as he has put
himself in their power they are not
gofng to be satisfied with anything
less than , an agreement on his part
to leave the county or stand trial for
his offense.

LA.\E AGAIN' SEEKS
TO LEAVE THE CITY
Shortly after the marriage of .Ger
trude Goewey to John W. Havens she
made a will in which she left her
share of the Goewey Estate Company
of San Francisco, valued at about $30,
000, to her four brothers, James M.,
Charles H.. Frank B. and Herbert S.
Goewey, it being property inherited
from their parents. This will was not
superseded until Mr3. Havens was on
her deathbed.
The birth of a son was the cause of
the mother's death. Shortly before
she died she said she wished to make
another will and left everything she
had to the boy. This will was filed
by Havens and shortly afterward the
former will was Hied by the. Goewey
brothers. They allege that their sister
was incompetent when she made the
last will and was unduly influenced
when she made it.
There is to be a contest over thÂ«
estate of the late Gertrude Goewey
Havens and in an ansjver filed to-day
by John W. Havens to the protest of
the Goewey brothers against the pro
bating of the last will of their sister
he flatly denies their allegations and
will make a fight for the property left
his infant son by its deceased mother.
It is stated that there Is little likeli
hood of a compromise being effected.

Havens Answers the Goewey
Brothei-s' Protest Against
Probating Sisters Will
Dr. Power, tho resident physician
at the hospital, say3 that Mrs. Stark
is suffering from exophthalmic goitre
and. in his opinion, was insane when
brought to tho institution. He de
clared positively that Mrs. Stark had
never been, moved from the ward from
her entry into the hospital ur^til she
was taken home.
Mrs. Stark made the following state
ment last night:
'"Last Tuesday night, when J was suf
fering excruciating pain, and possibly
made considerable noise, Dr. Jaynes
told me that unless I shut up he would
tie my hands and feet and lock me in
the cellar. The agony I was in was so
great that 1 could not keep quiet and
the nÂ«=xt day he carried out his threat
and I was taken to- the cellar below and
rr.y hunds and feet were both tied.
"On Wednesday my mother and broth
er came to the hospital for me and took
me home. They at first discredited my
story when I told them jbf the outrage
ous treatment I had received at the
hands of the hospital physician and his
assistants, and it was some time be
fore I ct-uld make them believe that
what I told them was true."
Detective Bailey was detailed on the
case. He found the reman in a very
weak and apparently dying condition
and sent for Assistant District Attor
ney Ward at 1 o'clock this morning to
take her dying statement.
A tale of purported cruelty almost
unbelievable is now under investiga
tion by the police upon the com
plaint of Mrs. Ray Stark of 2005 Mis
sion street. Mrs. Stark alleges that
while an inmate of the California
General Hospital on Douglass street
Dr. Jayncs had tied her hand and foot
and placed in the basement over
night because she soreamed with pain.
Mrs. Stark say? she entered the hos
pital on Tuesday and gave birth to
a child that night. On the following
evening she claims- that she wa*
bound and placed in the basement, be
ing left there until the following
morning. M. S. Nathan, a brother,
came to see her on Thursday after
noon ar.d h:>.d her taken home.
With tho acquisition of great wealth
their troubles began. They quarreled
while on a triu to Europe, but returned
together; Shortly afterward, however,
Mrs. Lindblom began an action for di
vorce. She alleged that Lindblom had
developed an unusual fondness for the
society of other women, and made her
travel second class in order to save
money on their trip abroad.
Before the case came to trial a com
promise was effected and Mrs. Lind
blom received 5180,000. It was during
these negotiations. Aldrich claims, that
he earned his fee.
A few years ago Lindblom was a
journeyman tailor In this city. He con
tracted the geld fever and went tu
Alaska, where he struck it rich. Ac
cording to his wire he I3 woith $3,300,000.
For his services in bringing about the
settlement of the difficulties between
Erik O. Lindblom. the Klondike mil
lionaire, and his wife, Mary A. Lind
blom, Attorney Hugh A!dr|ch demands
$5000. In a suit for this amount begun
to-day he says that he was promised
$7500. He has been paid J250J on . ac
count and is now suing for the balance
due.

ALAMEDA, March 12.â Fire broke
out this morning in an oil-burning loco
motive standing In the roundhouse at
the east end, and before the flames
were got under control and alarm was
turned in and the entire department
responded. The Cordes Hose Company
laid a line from High street and En
cinal avenue to the blazing: engine and
was ready to play a stream on the biy
machine when the employes In the
rountlhouse conquered the flames.
It was through a defect in the oil
burning apparatus that the locomotive
tcok f.re. An undiscovered leak had
permitted the inflammable fluid to
spread over the machinery beneath the
firebox. When the jets in the furnace
were lighted an explosion followed,
flames broke forth from under the loco
moiive and in an instant enveloped the
cab, causing the stoker to jump for
his life. The woodwork of the cab was
ruined and the oil-burners demolished.
The damaged engine was the ,flrst on
the south side local line to have an oil
burning furnace installed.
what difficulty and danger there is
among a lot of horses during a blaze.
The superintendents of stables could
have a fire drill occasionally with the
animals to accustom them to walk
down the chutes. One stable in Ala
meda has already arranged to put in
me escapes for horses."
"The late fire on Fifteenth street, in
which forty-nine horses were incin
erated, was a pitiful illustration of
what is liable to occur in any of the
larpre stables where the animals are
stalled on the second floor or higher.
In that fire the horses had no chance
for their lives. There was no passage
way leading from the upper floor out
of the stable. Our plan is to require
liverymen to have at least two chutes
leading directly to the ground from
ihe upper floors of barns where horses
are kept. Then there will be a chance
of getting the animals out of the stable
should a fire occur.
"These exits will be as useful to fire
me nas to horses, as we all know
Fire escapes and fire drills for horses
lodged in stables one or more stories
above the ground are advocated by
the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, and the organiza
tion will immediately inaugurate a
campaign to induce governing bodies
of the municipalities on this siOe of
the bay to enact ordinances requiring
liverymen to provide safety exits for
equines in cases of emergency. The
project of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals originated
with one of the members after the re
cent fire in the City stables in -which
forty-nine horses were burned to
death.
President Bey. E. E. Baker. Dr. Tom
Carpenter, Secretary Fred Johns and
Mrs. William Keith of the society are
planning a mearare to be submitted
to the City Council. It is intended to
submit like measures to the boards of
City Trustees in Alameda and Berke

ulation Dr. Carpenter said:

a slight advance. Some dealers were still ask

no sales Â«tre rirmrtcd at that figure. There
was an active market lor sÂ«eil Potatoes antf
all kinds were hlehcr. Early Rose belnr the.

change In Onions.
Receipts of Asparagus were 050 boxes, the
largest t:ius far for the season, and prices uf
all smiles were shaded, but the market cleaned
up well under a steady demand both for local
use and shipping- The Rhubnrb Association
fchlpp^ii In about 100 boxes of Rhubarb, which
was firmly held in the morning at 7(gSc per
pound, but jirices weakened later on upon the
receipt of several consignments from outside
growers, which were offered freely at the ln

CHICAGO. March 12. â The unrcrponsive
character of the Liverpool cables had a de
pressing effect upon the wheat market during
the first hour. The EmrllEh markets failed, to
reflect the strfnsrth shown in Chicago, and as
a result opening quotations here were easier.
May being Vic to 4c lower at 954c to Â»5?ic;
July M-asi'jC to %c lower at 90c to 90Â»&c. An
other factor of almost equal Importance was
the probability of relief from drouth in Kan
sas and Oklahoma. The weather bureau pre
dicted rain or mow throughout the West and
Southwest. Under these influences there was
quite jreneral selling early in the day. May
declined to !'5c. while July was carried down
to JWfciC. Seme information received from the
Northwest at this juncture made trade! s for
get about the rain and caused enough buy
ing to advance above yesterday's closint: fig
ures. Large sales of flour â 50.000 barrels â were
reported frorr. Minneapolis and 100,<XH> bushels
of wheat wers reported taken at "Duluth. A
sharp rally in com proved a bull factor in
wheat, starting shorts to cover. A dispatch from
Odessa claimed considerable anxiety Is be
ing felt m regard to thÂ« condition of the grow
ing crop. The market held strong during the
last half hour, the close bMng at the top,
with May 904c. Final figures on July were
at Ul?sÂ®914c.
In corn May opened a shade higher to 4 ( @% c
lower at Sll-'ic to 5;JV s c. After sellins be
tween 52 s 4c and 54>4c. thn close was at 544c-
July ranced between OO^e anil 51%c, and
closed with a cain of ?Â«c at 51 vie.
In oats the strength In wheat and corn
was a bull factor. May o:Â»ened unchanged
to hie lower at 41c to 414<-\ After ranging
between 40 T ic and 41',Â«c. the close wa3 at
41%c. July clcsfd Vic higher at 3'J^c, after
selling between ZWiQSd'Ac.
Provisions made modest reins on a light
trade. Tbere was a firm opening in sym
pathy with a better tone In hors. but the
market soon eased a trifle on Helling by pit
traders. A rally occurred later, duÂ« to the
strength in corn. There was a good demand
for May i>ork and that commodity closed 274
@:tOc iiigher at $14 25. May lard was up 74c
at $7 .17 4 and ribs 10c at *? :55.

Large lines of r.ll trades of Navel Oranges
were offering freely at easy prices, but tradfe
was still ot small volume, as local dealers
were not operating beyond immediate wants
and there was very little shipping demand. The
scarcity ot refrigerator cars has checked the
movement from the southern growing districts
to the East, and as a result receipts in this
market have been steadily Increasing for some
days. Tm or twelve cars are expected for
to-morrow's auction, and even if the weather
should become warmer and the market more
active it is not likely that prices will show
any Â¦ improvement. The market > was .bare of
Mexican Limes, but a steamer arrived late in

Termsâ One-flfth cash, balance in 1, 2, 3
and 4 years.
An exceptionally handsome Western Addi-
tion block has just been cut up into 45 extra
large lots, most of which are 33:4x120. ThÂ«Â«
block is near the corner of First ave. and
California st., and can easily be reached by
the Eddy-st. and Sacrhmento-st. cars. Get
off at First ave. The conditions surrounding
tho sale of this property are different from
the usual manner of selling property of this
character.
Mr. J. C. Jordan, the owner, has Imposed
the following conditions, which are to be rig-
idly enforced: '
No building will be allowed on the block
which will ce*t less than $3000.
No building shall lie erected for objection-
able purpose*. Including stores, livery stables,
coalyarUs, schools, churches, etc.
No three-story flats will be allowed.
If you want to secure a nice residence site
or make a good investment the above common-
sense restrictions will Insure not only the ad-
vance in value of lots In this block, but will
also protect any one who builds. Thousands
of people in the past few years have built
desirable homes and have been damaged or
ruined for the lack of just such protections.
In nil other large cities In the United States
the best property is sold under similar condi-
tions, which are of benefit to all.
Special attention Is called to the large lots.
It Is cheaper to build on a large lot than on a
small one, as tt does away with the unsightly
and unsatlsfnctory light wells and shortens the
building, besides giving a more artistic appear-
ance on the outside. The Interior arrangement
is much better and you secure an abundance
of H:ht and sun.
The large lots and the restrictions under
which the land is sold will Insure good neigh-
bors and an advance In the value of your
property. These, however, are not the only
facts which will advance the property. The
block Is exceptionally well located, is level
and all the streets are graded, sewered and
macadamized and are all SO feet wide. The"
property Is right on the line of the city's
prowth and the prices asked, $50 to $55 a
tront foot, are extremely low, as property
within a block or two Is Felling for from two
to three times the price asked for this.
An unusually splendid car service Is already
at hand, including the Eddy-et. electric, the
Sacramentc-st. cable, the Sutter and Clement-
st. line and the Geary and Callfornla-st. lines.
The last two are soon to be changed Into
electric systems.
These are only a few of the points to which
we wish to call your attention. We urgently
request you to make an Immediate inspection
of this property, and believe that If you do
you v/Ill agree with us that the property pre-
sents an unusual and unequaled opportunity
for either a homeseekÂ»r (including 2 flats) as
well as an excellent investment. If you will
look' ahead for a year or two and take Into
; consideration the rapid growth of the city
! in this direction you will undoubtedly become
! a riurchaser.

Never In the growth of the city have lots
been sold Â«o fast as tn this section during the
last two or three weeks. We have sold over
200 lots, representing In value about $225.-
000. Hundreds of new buildings will be
erected on tho lots already sold in the next
year. Insuring a certain increase in the
value of the property.
Go out and see the land at once. You
will be struck by the great activity In
building, etc. We will have three agents
on the grounds to-day (Sunday) to distribute ;
circulars, etc. There are only about 50 lots
! left, and at the rate they are now going
there will be none left In a very short time.
If the Bay District Land Company offers
any more holdlnrs they will be at consid-
erably higher prices. We urge you to buy
now. Considering that the property Is ail
level and near the Golden Gate Park, and
that all the streets are graded, sewered and
macadamized, ?40 to ?5O a front foot Is no
figure for the land. It will be a pleasant
i outinc for you to see the property, and If
you become a purchaser you will make
monpy. There will undoubtedly beta JaigÂ«
crowd on the crounds tn-day.

A Fortune In Stamps.
A remarkable exhibition of British
and colonial stamps has recently been
held at the Albemarle Gallery, Lon
don, where Mr. Field, the well-known
dealer, shows for inspection, not for
sale, 15,000 stamps,, whose value
amounts to more than Â£30,000.
A blue triangular Cape of Good
Hope stamp, which occupies a place
of honor, is worth Â£200, and has
gained several medals for being a
perfect specimen. Only three other
specimens exist. V^'I/J.
Early last year Mr. Field was called
upon by a man with some stamps who
offered to sell the lot for Â£16, includ
ing a triangular Cape, which was
covered with gum and had been
thumbed and carelessly treated.
In such a condition it was impos
sible to say whether it had passed
through the post or not If it had
passed through the post its value" was
only Â£8. Mr. Field, however, discov
ered, after the stamp had j been prop
erly cleaned, that it was free from the
postmark and worth full value.
Eighteen twopenny- blue English
stamps, ' which are also exhibited,
were, forty years ago/ placed in an
envelope by an old lady, and discov
ered only a year, agb.v Their face
value is 3c, but their worth now is

Chatsworth's Hollow Books.
There are at Chatsworth two li

West library. The doors are decorat

are furnished with imaginary titles
reminiscent of the . bygone love of
punning. Here are some of the titles
Tom Hood invented for the" sham
bookcases: "Wren's Voyage to 'the
Canaries," "Egg, by Shelley," "Horn
Took on Catching Cows," "Esterhazy
on Spring Fogs," "Macadam's
Rhodes," "Inigo Jones on Secret En
trances," "Minto's Coins," "Beveridge
on the Beer Act." Those who know
the treasures contained in the Chats
worth libraries, even while they smile
at such fooling, cannot but marvel at
the Incongruity of it. â London Dally

Praised the Kaiser.
A good story is being told at tha
court at Berlin respectinff the Kaiser's
well known tendency to take an Inter
est even In the smallest detail.
The other day he was walking in
the neighborhood of the new palaco
when he stopped to watch a number
of workmen busy repairing the facade
of the bulldlngr. His Majesty drew
near and immediately became an ob
ject of much interest to the men. es
pecially to one of them, who was ex
periencing great difficulty in fixing the
particular part of the facade allotted
to him.
The Kaiser suggested to the man a
.way. out of his difficulty, and to hia
advice the man replied in a friendly
tone. "Thanks, your Majesty. That's
not half a bad idea." The Kai3er
laughed and resumed his interrupted
walk. â London Dally Mail.
Two Kinds of Writers.
Two types of the writing man have
always been spoken of with scornâ the
man who "farms out" a literary job
to a. "ghost," publishing the result
over his own name, and the man who
Is willing to play the "ghost" But
apparently one has only to acquire the
right point of view In order to see
good in everything in this world.
Some one signing himself "Proxy" has
recently contributed to the Author a
curious defense of. "ghosting." He
puts the whole question on a practical
basis. A popular author, he argues,
must either content himself with a
comparatively small amount of work,
turning profitable offers away, or, hav
ing agreed to do more than he is able
properly to do, he must "scamp"
things. Therefore he is Justified in
falling back upon a "ghost." Pro
ceeding from this beautiful assump
tion, "Proxy" relates some of his own
experiences. "For the first long story
I 'ghosted,' " he says, "I received
Â£2 15s a thousand words all the way
through, one-third of the total amount
being paid to me before I had written
a line; one-third when I had com
pleted about one-half of the story;
one-half on the day I delivered the
SIS. complete." Are we touched by
these figures? Perhaps not, but let
"Proxy" continue his tale. "Now sup
posing." he says, "that I had written
that story on the chance of it being
accepted by some newspaper or syndi
cate, what would have happened ? In
the first place I should have worked
hard for four whole months without
receiving a single shilling," and so on
and so on, his plaint leading up to a
burst of enthusiasm over "the well
known writer who farms out his
work," that hero striking. him "as a
sort of heaven-sent being, and not, as
some appear to consider him, a species
of impostor." â New York Tribune.
HOW .MARGARET SULLIVAN
WON OVER THE PREMIER
Gave Him Some American Ideas on
News Reporting and Created
a Precedent.
Perhaps the most splendid triumph of
the late Margaret F.. Sullivan, a De
troit girl who became a famous Chi
cago journalist, was won when she
went to Paris in 1889 as correspondent
of the Associated Press at the Exposi
tion Universelle. Up to that time no
woman had ever been accorded official
recognition as a Journalist by the au
thorities of the French Government.
She arrived in Paris a month before the
opening and laid her credentials before
Prime Minister Tirard.
He received her cordially, but as to
admitting her to the opening ceremony
Mme. Sullivan, est une dame"
âit was impossibleâ "Mrs. Sullivan is a
lady." Mrs. Sullivan modestly assent
ed, adding archly, "and is confident of
finding the first Minister of France a
gentleman."
M. Tirard pointed out that there were
but 1500 seats under the dome of the
Fine Arts building, where the ceremo
nies were to be held, and that there al
ready were 3000 applicants.
"Will it not be enough to report the
ceremony a day later?" he asked.
"M. Minister," was the instant reply,
"there is no 'day later' in American
journalism."
Finally the question was placed be
fore President Carnot, Mrs. Sullivan
appearing to argue the matter. The
President was in a quandary.
"The French republic," he said, "has
never given official recognition to a
lady."
"Your Excellency," replied Mrs. Sul
livan, "it is time the French republic
created a precedent." j
The remark seemed to impress the
President, and the order went forth
that Mrs. Sullivan was to be admitted
to the ceremonials, and thenceforward
afforded every courtesy. Her first dis
patch of 5000 words, analyzing the ex
hibition as a. whole and describing the
opening ceremonial, was duly written
and hailed as one of the ablest and
most comprehensive coming from the
pen of any correspondent.
Mrs. Sullivan remained throughout
the exposition, and, in addition to her
reports, wrote voluminously on Euro
pean subjects in general. Six articles
in particular, which appeared in the
New York Sun on the Irish landlord
system, were models of style and re
markable for their comprehensive grasp
of the subject.â Baltimore Sun.
Thirteen hundred and seventy-one
years ago, although millions of the
world's inhabitants had become Chris
tians, the expression Anno Domini was
as yet unheard of. It was not until the
date we now should term 532 A. D. that
a monk named Dionysius Exiguus, a
Scythian by birth, suggested that all
Christians should adopt the epoch of
the birth of Christ as a starting point
for counting time.
At that time the precise date of the
birth of Christ had actually been for
gotten. Dionysius made researches and
eventually decided that it occurred on
the 25th of December In the seven hun
dred and fifty-third year from the foun
dation of Rome, and to this date the
Christian world has ever since adhered,
though it is now well known to be In
correct.
THE YEAR A. 17. C. 2656.
At first it was suggested that the
Christian year should commence from
that dayâ December 25. But this was
found inconvenient, aijd eventually the
ordinary Roman usage of commencing
the year on January 1 was adopted, so
that our calendar dates from New Year
day of the seven hundred and fifty
fourth year from the founding of
Rome. If, therefore, we still dated our
letters acco'rding to the usage at that
time prevalent we should write, not A.
D. 1904, but A. U. C. 2657 (A. U. C.
stands for the Latin words "Ab Urbe
Condita." meaning "from the founding
of the city").
Astronomers and chronologists do not
find the epoch of our existing era suit
able for technical purposes, the birth
of Christ being, comparatively speak
ing, too recent an event. They have,
therefore, adopted the so-called Julian
period. This period contains 79S0 years,
and Is reckoned as having begun on
January 1, 4713 years before our era
commences.
The Julian Deriod of 79S0 years was
not chosen arbitrarily, but is formed
by multiplying together the lunar cycle
of nineteen yearsâ the moon's changes
occur at about the same time after each
nineteen years â the solar cycle of twen
ty-eight years, and the Roman cycle of
fifteen years. The nearest date at
which all these cycles began together
was B. C. 4713. The present year is,
therefore, 6616* of the Julian epoch.
THREE SACRED RECKONINGS.
Many have suggested that the date
should be counted from the year of the
foundation of the world â or, rather,
from the time of Adam. Unfortunate
ly hardly any two authorities agree.
No fewer than 120 different epochs of
creation have been enumerated, which
range from 6934 B. C. to 3616 B. C. The
usual date taken is 4000 B. C, making
the present year Annus Mundi 5304.
Even the three sacred reckonings are
very different. The following table
makes clear the differences between the
Jewish, Samaritan and Septuagint reck
onings:
Jew- Samarl- Septua-
Period â ish. tan. gint.
Adam to Noah 1656 1307 2242
Noah to Abraham... 292 942 W2
Abraham to Christ.. 2O44 2M4 2<H4
Creation to Christ .. .3992 4293 B228
Present date 5896 6198 "132
None of these dates corresponds with
that at present used by the Jewish na
tion. The Jewish year 5664 began on
October 2, 1903. Accordlr_ to this
creation was 3760 B. C. Curiously
enough, the Freemasons use similar
chronology, but : put the creation 4000
B. C. Up to the fifteenth century of
our era the Jews used the Macedonian
era, which dates from 311 B. C. Somes
of the Arabians still do so.
The tieater part of the Eastern
world Is, however, Mohammedan, and
their era is that of the Hegira. This
began A. D. 622. In th..t year Mo
hammed fled from Mecca to Tathreb,
afterward called Medina, and there
was received as a prophet and a prince.
The era of the Hegira dates from July
16, 622, but, owing to differences be
t een Mohammedan and Christian
reckoning, the Mohammedan year 1321
commences on April 10 of the present
year. The Mohammedan year being
strictly a lunar one, their calendar has
to be adjusted from time io time. They,
therefore, use cycles of thirty years, of
which nineteen have 354 days end the
other eleven 355 days each.
The Hindu chronology, as well as
that of all the other Buddhists in the
Eastern world, is fixed, like that, of the
Mohammedans, from the date -? their
great founder Buddha. 'This era com

therefore, 2447 with i the Buddhist
world.
WHAT EXCAVATION PROVED.
The oldest epochs of accurate
chronology are those of the Chinese
and the Babylonians. Thi3 is because
these two nations were the first to at
tain any accurate knowledge of astron
omy. Fairly accurate chronology in
Babylonia begins with the reign of
Sargon I, King of Agade, 3800 B. C.
About 554 B. C. there was dug up at
Sippara the foundation stones of a
temple to the sun god. The finder of
the stone was Nabonldas, King of
Babylon, and he has put it on record
that Naram Sin reigned 3200 years
before his time.
In 1862 Sir Henry Rawlinson dug
up the famous Assyrian Eponyn
Canon, which fixes definitely chrono
logy of Assyria from 1330 B. C. to 620
B- C. Russia is the only European
country besides Turkey whose calendar
differs from ours. But the difference
Is not a matter of years â only of days.
It 'exists because Russia uses the old
style instead of the new. The old
style calendar is that inaugurated by
Julius Caesar In B. C. 47. By it the
year was taken as being 3 6 3*4 days.
In order to work in the odd quarter,
every fourth year was made a leap
year. But the solar year being eleven
minutes twelve seconds less than 365U
days, the Julian calendar gradually
became inaccurate. An easy sum will
show that by A. D. 1582 the difference
amounted to ten days.
In that year Aloysius LlIIus, an Ital-
No European monarch stands more
on his dignity than does his Majesty
King George of Tonga. Surrounded by
all the formal etiquette and ceremonial
of a royal court, with military and of
ficial uniforms and a superabundance
of gold lace and nodding plumes, ho
naturally considers himself a personage
of some importance and as such en
titled to deference on the part of the
representatives of other powers, a fact
unintentionally overlooked by Captain
Choates and the officers of H. M. S.
Sparrow during some festivities at Nu
kualofa, the Tongan capital and prin
cipal seaport. The Tongan people are
exceedingly hospitable, as is the Ton
gan monarch, and when Hamilton
Hume, the British Consul, gave a se
ries of. evening dances and entertain
ments in celebration of the vessel's ar
rival the Invitations were eagerly ac
cepted by those to whom they were
addressed, and followed by numerous
presents and invitations to both the
officers and crew of the Sparrow, who
for several days had a somewhat lively
time of it. Of course, the compliment
had to be returned, and accordingly
the captain and officers of the Spar
row arranged for a dance on board
their vessel, which was brought along
side the landing wharf for that pur
pose. The deck was tastefully decor
ated with bunting and foliage and bril
liantly lighted by means of a dynamo.
The guests were punctual to time, but
Just as the dancing was about to begia
something went wrong with the dy
namo and the place became plunged
in darkness. There was plenty of oil
light in the fore part of the vessel, but
it was cut off by the decorations and
the screens put up for coaling on the
following day.
There was great consternation among
the guests, which was relieved by
Thomas Roberts, Assistant Collector of
Customs under the Tongan Govern
ment, and who was one of the guests,
suggesting that the light from the
lighthouse protecting the approach to
the wharf should be obtained for a
short time.
Captain Coates, it is asserted,
thought this a good idea and as the
Tongan official, who had charge of tho
key. could not be found one of the
staples in the door was drawn, tha
door opened and the hanging kerosene
lantern taken out for a short time to
replace the light that failed. The dy
namo was speedily put in working or
der and when this was accomplished
the lantern was taken back to the
lighthouse, the remainder of the even
ing passing off in a most pleasant
manner. The Tongan authorities did
not appear to have taken any notice
of the incident, but their silence was
merely the calm before the storm, for
a week later the unlucky Assistant
Collector of Customs received an of
ficial letter to the effect that his ser
vices under the Tongan Government
were no longer required and instruct
ing him to deliver up his keys to hia
successor. This was an unexpected
bolt from the blue. Captain Coatea
and his officers expressed great Indig
nation at the arbitrary action of the
Tongan Government and forwarded to
the King a letter, in which the cap
tain, after stating the facts of the case,
manfulry took all the responsibility on
his own shoulders and asked that tho
matter, might be reconsidered. Tho
King lost no time in replying, but tho
tone ' of his letter was anything but
favorable. He Justified the action of
his Government and stated that ha
gathered from the contents of the cap
tain's letter that it was Mr. Roberts
who had removed the lantern from
the lighthouse, which was an illegal
act. Captain Coates, in reply, said
that he regarded the King's attitudo
as unsatisfactory and thus the matter
ends for the present.
Accounts of the affair have been
forwarded by Captain Coates to his
senior officer, the captain of H. M. 3.
Pylades, to his Excellency the High
Commissioner at Fiji, and Hamilton
Hume, O. M. C. the British Consul in
Tonga. Mr. Macauley, harbor-rbaster
and receiving officer at the port, has
succeeded Mr. Roberts, his own placo
being taken by Mr. Denny, formerly
purser on board one of the large Aus
tralasian interstate vessels. According
to several leading Tongana, the whole
trouble might have been avoided had
an apology for removing the light
been forwarded to the authorities on
the morning following the dance. It
was neglect in this respect which
moved the ire of the Tongan King,
who regarded the action of Captain
Coatea as insulting, but at the same
time did not care to become involved
in a dispute with him. The Tongans
furthermore assert that in dismissing
Mr. Roberta the King's officers merely
did what those of any European power
would have done in similar circum
stances and that the British Govern
ment has no right to Interfere in tha
matter. â London Globe.
So far as can be recollected there
have been only three entertainments
given at the White House of an en
tirely Juvenile mark. These were the
fancy dress ball for children during
the administration of John Tyler, the
party given by the grandchildren of
President Johnson on Tuesday, the
28th day of December, that being the
sixtieth anniversary of the birth of
Mr. Johnson, and the recent chil
dren's festival given by President
Roosevelt. This is, of course, fresh in
every one's memory, the other two
being far away in niches of the past.
On a day of last week
ative of the Star was talking with that
venerable attache of the White House
staff. Doorkeeper Pendel, who has
been' on duty at the inner portals al
most "from that time when the mem
ory of man runnetty not to the con
trary," about the Johnson grandchil
dren's festival. | "There were not* so
many children present at that soiree,"
said the old official, "as at the recent
entertainment given by Mr. Roose
velt, but I think the crowd of boys and
girls numbered at least 400, and they
had the finest fun ever had before in
all their lives. "Of course, they have
all grown up to be men and women
now, for that delightful event hap
pened thirty-five years ago. The re
membrance of it I will venture to say
lingers in the mind of every child who
was present and who Is still on earth.
Alas!" he said, "several of them have
in the long lapse of time since then
passed into another world, and nearly
all of the elder folk who were present
are dead."
Mr. Pendel's two children, Frank and
Ida, were among the guests at this, fes
tival, and the Star reporter was shown
the souvenirs they, in common with all
the children, were given before the par
ty ended. They were beautiful little
designs imported from France, and
each contained a bonbon of some de
scription. One of them was a miniature
sailor's hat of the style worn by young
ladies in that period, while the other
was /a pretty rosette. They had been
carefully inclosed in a box and were in
a remarkable condition of preservation.
Danced In East Room.
The carpet in i the great East room
had been covered with some sort of
linen crash for the children to dance
on, and this they did to their hearts'
content. The dancing arrangements
were under the management of Pro
fessors Marinl and Bates, who prepared
the following programme: Promenade,
quadrille, polka, lancers and gallop.
Then followed an intermission, after
which the young . masters and -misses,
refreshed and reinvigorated by the de
lights of the repast that characterized
the intermission, happily and hastily
lined up to again trip the "light fan
tastic toe" as directed In the "second
part of the dancing card. This began
with a waltz and was followed in the
order named by the basket, esmerald,
varsovienne, lancers, polka-redowa and
galop.
"The promenade," said Mr. Pendel,
"was really a beautiful scene, and the
quadrille which followed it was abso
lutely grand. All the children present
joined in it, and the elder folks, a great
many of whom were present, looked on
with rapture at the eyolutions of the
little ones." - â¢
The Grand Collation.
There was a. grand collation served
in the State dining-room, which was
prepared by the old-time confectioner,
Joseph H. Shaffleld. and this, said Mr.
Pendel, attracted 1 much more attention
from the grown folks than it did from
the little ones, whose heads and hearts
were turned with dancing and merry
making generally. "There were a num
ber of newspaper men present," con
tinued j the old gentleman, "and they
were taken in charge by those two
magnificent men, the late Colonel Wil
liam G. Moore and the late W. W.
Worden, both of the President's staff
of secretaries. They took the reporters
down In the basement somewhere. - I
don't know how they treated them
when they got them off by ' them
selves." he continued, "but they kept
them dewn below for a long time."
At this long-gone-by festival, which
was called "Andy Johnson's" party,
because it was given by his grandchil
dren in honor of his birthday, one fea
ture attracted much attention. That
was the appearance of Mrs. Johnson,
the wife of the President, who was an
invalid, and this was her third appear
ance at a public reception during the
entire term of her husband's rather
stormy administration of the Presi
dent's office. The affair was also dig
nified by the presence of many foreign
ministers, the members of the Cabinet.
Senators and members of Congress and
numerous private . citizens.-AVashing
ton Star.
"Did you ever know what became of
Minister Chang, who represented China
here during Cleveland's administra
tion?" asked a well-known resident of
a Star reporter the other day. "No?
Well, his career was a very unusual
one. You remember, doubtless, that he
resided in Stewart Castle, fronting on
Dupont Circle, and his prodigal hospi
tality broke the record. He save en
tertainments on the most lavish scale,
and invited hundreds of people, some of
whom fairly wallowed in champagne.
Tried to Modernize China.
"Chang was a very able man, and
made many friends In this and other
countries to which he was accredited.
He had very_ progressive ideas about
the future China, and when he was re
called he carried with him a firm de
termination to put -them in force. He
became one of the intimate advisers of
the Emperor, and was one of that little
band of Chinese statesmen who en
deavored to modernize China in the
nineties, and who were making very
good progress until the Empress Dow
ager assumed control and took all
authority from the Emperor and made
only a dummy of him. In order to do
that she had to get rid of these liberals,
who had held such influence over him.
This she did by condemning all of them
to death. Chang was among the num
ber condemned to be beheaded. Before
the sentence was executed an effort was
made to save him and it was success
ful.
"It came about in this way:
"Mr. John W. Foster, who knows
China and the Chinese better than any
other man in this country, and who was
a personal friend of Chang, decided to
save his life, If possible. He called on
Secretary Hay and placed the facts in
the case before him, and asked him to
use his good offices in Chang's behalf
and to ask the British Government to
Join in the good work. Mr. Hay readily
agreed to do so, and both the American
and British representatives at Peking
were at once directed to ask a com
mutation of sentence as a favor to their
governments.
Ufe Saved Once.
"Their efforts were successful and
Chang's life was saved, but he was
banished for life. He wouldn't have
asked anything better than to live in
one of the western countries that he ad
mired so much, but that, of course, was
not allowed. He was sent two or three
thousand miles into the province of
Mongolia, and he was sentenced to
hard labor for life. He had to make the
trip In a crude Oriental cart, and it
took him a long time to reach his des
tination. He was always fond of good
living, and succeeded in gaining'per
mission to take his cook, a good one,
with him.
"The present Chinese Embassador
was at that time Chang's secretary, and
he vyas allowed, to accompany his mas
ter part of the way. The Governor of
Mongolia, whose duty it was to see
jthat Chang'a sentence was carried out,
had at one time a protege of
Chang, fortunately, and he saw to it
that Chang was not compelled to labor.
That much of his severe sentence was
not carried out. But there he was in
that distant province cut off from rela
tives and friends, living the life of an
outcast.
Final Execution.
"Then came the uprising of the Box
ers, and the conservative element
gained absolute control at Peking.
Chang's enemies used their influence
with the Empress Dowager to secure
the execution of Chang's original sen
tence. A secret messenger was dis
patched to Mongolia, and on his ar
rival Chang was promptly beheaded.
It was very unfortunate for China, for
Chang's advice would have been inval
uable in the unsettled affairs at Peking
which 7 followed.
"Now, here's the sequel to the story:
Not a great while ago Mr. Poster re
ceived a pitiful letter from a young
son of Chang, telling him that hl3
father's property had been confiscated
and the family name had, been de
graded. He begged Mr. Foster to use
his influence to have his father's good
name restored, so that his descendants
would not be disgraced forever. Mr.
Foster was touched by the appeal. He
promptly called upon Secretary Hay,
told him the story and asked his as
sistance. It was promptly given, and
his efforts proved successful. Chang's
good name was restored, and I think
some," if not all, of his estate was re
turned to his family. Curious country,
that China, isn't it?" â Washington

Moldy Flour Makes Poor Bread.
The crew of the Norwegian bark Theodor
have made complaint to Norwegian Consul
Henry Lund of the duality of the flour served
durin" the voyage just ended. The Consul
found that the ship's flour had- turned moldy
two wecUs before Che vessel arrived here and
that the bread made from , this tainted flour
was probably not up to the standard demand
ed by the human rialate. He exonerated the
captain of responsibility, however, accepting
the excuse that the Theodor's voyage . was*
much longer than the owners had any reason
to expect or make provision for, â¢ and that
there was an ample supply of other whole
some food, on board.

Discovered Source of Life.
"I have discovered the source of
life!"
The new professor, who had only
been drawing a salary for three days
in the great university, flourished in
hl3 hand a quart bottle of protoplasm
as he spoke, standing upon the thres
hold oi the president's office.
That gentleman frowned.
"If that's the best you can do." he
observed, "I'm afraid you'll lose your
job."
_ "But, my dear sir." remonstrated the
new professor, "is It nothing: to discov
er the source of life?"
And the president smiled sarcastical
ly as he replied:
"Absolutely nothing, .sir. in these
days. Why, only this week the source
oÂ£ life has been dinscovered four times
without attracting absolutely any at
tention at all from the papers. â¢ Young
man, unless you can discover some
thing new and startling enough to ad
vertise this college in %he proper man
ner. I warn you that your . days are
numbered." â Life.

elmultancously and heeled over to the breeze
In unison and yesterday afternoon two specks
seen en the horizon by Merchants' Exchange

TO SAIL.
Crew of Counterfeit Sailors.
As a result of the scarcity of sailors at this
port some of the crews being ehipped on deep
water vessels are of questionable quality.
When he can the Ehipping master secures
"Bailors" to suppiy the demand, but when the
supply of seamen fails the resourceful broker
chins anything human that resembles an able
bodied man. Th*Â«e Inexperienced substitutes
or counterfeit sailors are known In sailor
dcallng circles as "stiffs." The British ship
Iredale. in the stream and ready for sea, re
cently shipped a crew of ten. An attempt to
bend sail revealed the fact that of the ten
men shipped as sailors there was hardly one
Sat would or could go aloft. They were all
â¢ttlffs." Captain Prarce refuses to go to
sea with an Imitation crew and the vessel's
sailing has been postponed until the shipping
master agree* to take back his useVess wares
and replace them with seamen.
Importance of Foreign Languages.
Sir Howard Vincent, from the appro
priate atmosphere of Cannes, discusses
in the London Times the relative im
portance of foreign languages. To Ger
man he gives a very low place, indeed:
"French, it seems to me, comes easily
first. It is the international language,
the language always employed in any
mixed gathering of civilized peoples,
the language of diplomacy, of light lit
erature.
"After that, for the English commer
cial student, Spanish takes a leading
place with its millions of speakers in
the Peninsula and in South America.
Next I should place Arabic, as the
foundation of all communication in
Turkey, Egypt, Northern Africa, Ara
bia and Persia, ivith their vast marts
of the present and future. Russian has
brought me personally more interest,
and, indeed, profit, than any other
study with its 120,000,000 of speakers,
with whom every year we must be
more and more in contact. Chinese is
a fortune in itself, but its acquisition is
beyond the power of most people. A
knowledge of Italian is a keen delight,
and it is also useful. Modern Greek
and Dutch are also valuable, and in
proportion as they are little known by
foreigners. :â¢'
"But where, then, does German, in
my humble opinion, come in? By rea
son of the extraordinary linguistic
power of the Germans, far from the
top of the list for_an English commer
cial student not" contemplating resi
dence in Germany.
"German opens to the student the
deepest of literatures. But outside the
German empire and Austria, knowl
edge of German is not of much use, and
within those frontiers nearly all im
portant business people can speak and
correspond In English."

Description of the New Issue â Direc-
tibns Given to Bureau of Engrav
ing and Printing.
An order has been sent to the Bu
reau of Engraving and Printing from
the office of the Third Assistant -Post
master General for the first issue of
the new Louisiana Purchase Exposi*
tion postage stamps, which are to be
placed on sale throughout the country
May 1. These stamps are printed with
pink ink in denominations of 1 cent. 2
cent, 3 cent, 5 cent and 10 cent, and
each bears a different engraving. In
the order given the stamps bear por
traits of Robert R. Livingston, Tliomas
Jefferson, James Monroe, William Mc-
Klnley and a 'map of the United States
showing the territory acquired by the
Louisiana purchase. There have been
ordered 90,000,000 of the 1-cent stamps,
225,000,000 of the 2-cent 7,500,000 of the
3-cent, 9,500,000 of the 5-cent and 6,500,
00) of .the 10-cent. As soon as the Bu
reau of Engraving and Printing can
print them they ,will be forwarded to
the different distributing centers of the
postal service, and from there sent to
al! of the offices of the country as they
are called for by the Postmasters. The
sale of these stamps will continue while
the exposition at Ct. Louis is open.
Livingston's portrait was placed on
the 1-cent stamp because he was the
United States Mh-ster to* France at
the time of the transfer of the property
and conducted the negotiations.
Thomas Jefferson was the President of
the United States at the time, and
James Monroe was special Embassador
to France, empowered to conclude the
purchase. â¢
McKinley'a face appears on the 5
cent stamp because he was President
at the time the legislation was enacted
that connected the Government with
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and
signed the act in his official capacity,
and the significance of the map show
ing the territory la self-evident.
It is not generally known that a spe
cial issue of postage stamps is a fine
investment for the Government, though
there is no activity displayed to se
cure the issue. The profit comes from
the fact that philatelists buy as many
of the new issue as they can carry and
hold them for the certain rise that is
sure to come when the issue is ex
hausted. These stamps are therefore
not used, and the Government having
sold them at their face value profits
accordingly, the only cost being tha
value of the paper, the glue, the print
ing and the ink, a mere nominal cost
when compared with the sum for which
they are sold. Many thousands of dol
lars were made by the Government
during the run of the Pan-American
stamps, and there is no reason to sup
pose that a similar condition will not
occur when the St. Louis Exposition
stamps are put on sale.â Washington

NEW SOURCE FOUND
FOR IXDIARUBBEIt
Produced From Koot of Plant Found
in French Conso Coun
try.
A French botanist, in the course of
his explorations a few weeks ago in
the sandy plains of the French Congo,
discovered a plant the bark of which
contained a large quantity of fibrous
rubber. At the time scarcely any at
tention was paid to the discovery, but
owing to the scarcity of rubber and
its high commercial value, which is
in reality so- prohibitive as to prevent
a very wide employment of the sub
stance, attempts are being made in
England to turn the new discovery to
commercial use. The plant also thrives
profusely in Northern Nigeria, and it
is these forests which are to be ex
ploited. A sample of the plant has
been analyzed by the botanical authori
ties of Kew Gardens, London, and these
investigations show that the rubber ex
ists in the roots in sufficiently large
quantities to warrant development.
The name of the plant is Londolphia
thrallonii. It is to be found in many
places on the west coast of Africa.
One firm which is already engaged in
the manufacture of this rubber Is plac
ing it upc-n the market at 75 cents a
pound, and it Is in every respect equal
to the ordinary rubber.
Indiarubber has become such an in
dispensable material in the arts and
sciences that users will be glad to learn
that a fresh source of supply is said to
have been found in the white man
grove trw, which grows plentifully in
the swampy lands along the coast of
Central Queensland. The sap is ob
tained by making incisions in the bark
of the tree and allowing it to run into
tins. Some samples of the rubber thus
obtained are said to have brought $1
a pound in England. An idea of the
importance of the rubber trade may
be formed from the statement that the
United States and England alone ab
sorb over 50,000,000 pounds annually. â

Authorship in America.
We should like to call the attention of
home market clubs and Infant industry
nurseries to the condition of the au
thouship business in the United States.
During 15)02 the total production of this
hustling world was 200,000 volumes.
The output seems small enough'In com
parison with the world's annual stock
of other commodities, but so long as it
is large enough to keep our evenings
and holidays busy we have no general
right to complain. The trouble comes
when we- analyze the figures. During
1902 the United States published but
7833 columns, barely worsting England,
which follows us with a total of 7700,
and losing to Germany's 26,900 to the
tune of 1 to 3. What becomes of our
ladies' literary leagues and home cult
ure clubs in the face of hard figures?
Where is Kentucky now, and where is
Indiana? Shall three Americans go
down before one German? Shall each
million Germans have 354 books each
year while a Americans are
content with eighty-one? j
Reverse the shield. Last year Ger
many published 8049 newspapers and
periodicals. The United States 21,000.

The passengers that arrived here yes
terday from Panama and way ports on
the steamship San Juan, Captain Al
fred Urry in command, report the Cen
tral American republics chafing under
the tedium of a protracted peace. There
is no definite sign of revolution any
where, but in every republic between
Panama and Guatemala ia some indica
tion of unrest. Incendiary literature is
being distributed broadcast' and every
thing points to a speedy return of the
revolutionary excitement which is the
prominent feature of life in Latin
America. ,
Among the San Juan's passengers
was Brigadier Gejieral William H.
Forwood, U. S. aT, retired. General
Forwood came from New York and is
traveling for pleasure. He says the
health of the United States marines
stationed on the isthmus is splendid.
Their camps have been pitched on ele
vations and the amount of sickness is
no greater than would be found among
a similar number of men in barracks
in any part of the United States. Pan
ama, however, in the opinion of the
general, is a most unhealthy port. He
says that the native soldiers obtained
their drinking water from a hole in the
ground dug in the center of a horse
corral.
The San Juan brought 1100 tons of
cargo and treasure valued at $79,890.
Her passengers included the following

say that you would die for me. Do
you love me as well as you did then?"
"I guess so." said the husband.
"You would still die for me?"
"Well, if it were necessary, I sup

"How glad 1 am to hear you say so."
"Why?"
"Because I am going to, put you to

UNITED STATES REVENUE CUTTER DANIEL MANNING. WHICH
ARRIVED YESTERDAY FROM SEATTLE, :CD IN SPITE OF THE
SOUTHEASTER CAME DOWN IN FOUR AND A HALF DAYS.
Special Dispatch 'to The Call,
LOS ANGELES, March 12.â Before
the- eyes of hundreds of pleasure seek
ers on the pier at Ocean Park. South
Santa Monica, this afternoon Mrs. M>.
Daley of Denver threw hersejf into the
ocean, intending to commit suicide. She
was rescued by the- heroic action of two
men who swam through the breakers
and caught her by the hair.
The woman is said to be a member of
a wealthy Denver family. She came
here for her health two months ago and
took a cottaje at Ocean Park. The
change of climate did not benefit her
and of late she had been growing mel
ancholy'. This 'afternoon she went to
the extreme end of the pleasure wharf
and after kneeling in prayer sprang
over the railing into the ocean.
Scores of persons on the pier and
beach saw her jump and they gave the
alarm. Among them were Charles Tur
ner and Tom Brown. Both sprang into
the surf and swam to the rescue. The
skirts of the woman, spreading out,
held her up, and when the rescuers
reached her they found^her floating on
the surface of the water, but uncon
scious. Together they , brought her to
the shore, where efforts were made to
restore animation. The limp body was
rolled over a barrel and other methods
were resorted to. To-night, as a result
of cold and shock, pneumonia devel
oped and the condition of the woman
is critical.
NEW. YORK, March 12.â The Finan
cier says: "The striking feature of
the official statement of the-assodated
banks last week was the decrease In
all the principal items and the very
slight change in ths surplus reserve.
Contrary to expectation, the loans
were decreased by $2,519,100. Falling off
in loans was attributable to the light
demands fur stock exchange purposes
owing to the small volume of specu
lative operations. The cash decreased
by ?S37,5Q0, which sum very closely
corresponded with the amount of $753,
500 loss which was estimated from the
traceable movements of money during
the week. Deposits decreased $3,324.
900, or only $32,000 less than the sum
of the reductions in loans and of the
loss of cash. The statement therefore
showed a remarkably good balance.
The item of Government deposits was
increased $397,800 during the week,
probably representing accumulations
through transfers to this city from in
terior depositories. The increase in
such I deposits since February C has
been $2,641,700. Circulation was reduc
ed last week by $1,206,900, making
$6,962,800 since January 2. The cash
reserve of the banks will probably be
augmented this week by the transfer
hither of $.1,000,000, the proceeds of the
6,000,000 yen which is expected to ar
rive in San Francisco during the week.
Comparisons of changes in loans show
that four of the larger banks decreased
this item by $H, 400,000.
CHICAGO. March 12. â Hanging for
all was the verdict of the jury re
turned to-day in the case against the
so-called car-barn bandits, Harvey
Vandine, Peter Niedermeier and Gus
tav Marx.
The trio attained notoriety by a
desperate all-day battle that started
in a dug-out near Liverpool, Ind.,
where they had taken refuge after a
series of remarkable crimes, includ
ing the murder of two employes of the
Chicago City Railway Company at one
of the company's barns in this city,
the motive in each instance being rob
bery.
Emil Roeski, who was with the
bandits in the dug-out^and who par
ticipated in many of their crimes, is
to be tried separately, not having been
Implicated directly in the particular
murder for which his associates were
first arraigned.
The verdict of the Jury was delayed
from yesterday afternoon until to-day
on account of a temporary diversion
of opinion to make the punishment
alike for all. A confession on the part
of Marx led to the discovery of the
hiding place of the other bandits. Marx
entered a plea of guilty and begged
for mercy, while the other bandits at
tempted to brazen-out a plea of inno
cence. Hereditary epilepsy was" plead
ed in the case of Vandine.
The bandits heard their doom stol
idly. The mother of Vandine was in
the courtroom. Niedermeier's mother
was also present. Neither woman
made any outcry. The mother of Marx
did not appear. She was said to be
at home in a state bordering on col
lapse. . t

ANOTHER DOUBTFUL TAU3
Â¦ ABOUT WASHINGTON
That His Mother Refused to Let Her
Horses Be Impressed by Conti
nentals.
Much of George Washington's firm
strength of character was due to his
splendid ancestry, as the following an
ecdote will testify.
While reconnoitering in Westmore
land County, Va., one of General
Washington's officers chanced upon a
fine team of hones driven before a
plow by a burly slave. Finer animals
he had never seen. When his eyes had
feasted on their beauty -he cried to the
driver:
"Hello, good fellow! I must have
those horses. . They are just such ani
mals as 1 have been looking for."
The black man grinned, rolled up the
whites" of his eye* put the lash to the
horses* flanks and turned up another
furrow in the rich soil. The officer
waited until he had finished the row;
then, throwing back his cavalier cloak,
the ensign of rank dazzled the slave's
eyes. %0'
"Better see missis! Better see mis
sis!" he cried, waving his hand to the
south, where above the cedar growth
rose the towers of a flrfe old Virginia
mansion. The officer turned â¢ up the
carriage road and soon was rapping the
great brass knocker of the front door.
Quick the door swung upon its ponder
ous hinges and a grave, majestic look
ing woman confronted the visitor with
an air of inquiry.
"Madame," said the officer, doffing
his cap and overcome by her dignity,
"I have come to claim your horses in
the name of the Government."
"My horses?" said she. bending upon
him a pair of eyes born to command.
"Sir, you cannot have them. My crops
are f out and I need my horses in the
field."
"I am sorry," said the officer, "but I
must have them, madame. Such are
the orders of my chief."
"Your chief? Who is your chief,
pray?" she demanded with restrained
warmth.
"The commander of the American
army. General George Washington."
replied the other, squaring his shoul
ders and swelling with pride. A smile
of triumph softened the sternness of
the woman's handsome features. "Tell
George Washington," said she, "that
his mother says he cannot have her
horses."
With an humble apology, the officer
turned away, convinced that he had
found the source of his chiefs decision
and self-command.
And did Washington order his officer
to return and make his mother give up
her horses? No; he listened to the re
port in silence; then, with one of his
rare smiles, he bowed his head.â St.
Nicholas.

A suggestion made by Dr. Regens

chased me.t with unanimous approval.
The use of this machine would save
hundreds of dollars to citizens, and if
a, small fee were charged it could be
made self-supporting. To illustrate the
value of the appliance a case was cited
of recent occurrence where, new bed
dingr and blankets were burned by or
der of the Health Board. The goods de
stroyed were worth considerable money
and the owner could ill afford the loss.
The destruction of these goods would
have been unnecessary could they have

It was reported that the rat vlrua re-
with wooden floors, as these form a
favorite breeding place for rats and the
rats carry infectious diseases from one
place to another. As a preventive meas
ure these wooden floorings are being
torn out and the buildings made "rat
proof" by the laying of concrete floors.
It was suggested that as a further
measure for the. protection of the city
an ordinance be passed making it
mandatory upon all persons erecting
new houses to lay concrete floors in
their cellars and construct the walls of
cellars ejther of artificial stone or brick.
In this way It is hoped the rats will be
gradually exterminated. While it is Im
possible to compel all property owners
to lay concrete floors In the cellars of
buildings already in existence, careful
inspection will be made, and whenever
it is deemed advisrble the owner will
be notified to do away with his old
wooden flooring .and replace it with
concrete.
The introduction of sanitary plumbing
in Chinatown seems in some sections to
be an almost hopeless task. While the
owners of the buildings have cheerfully
complied with the regulations, their oc
cupants refuse to use the. improved
methods, persistently throwing refuse
at their doorways instead of in the re
ceptacles provided.
