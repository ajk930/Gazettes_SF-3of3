' ; the-" office and fell Ito 'the ground as Mlsa
Dudley.' was passing. .; Jj
Perceiving at a glance what was ; the
animal's" trouble, the " nurse ran Into a
store.; sought Richard Tarr,the owner of
the concern, and asked him to get for her
some "ammonia,' whisky and ice. Throw
ing'; aside her hat and rolling .; up the
sleeves of her" shirtwaist,' Miss Dudley
kheele'a'ori tnepavement beside" the pros
trate beast and carefully applied . lee to
its \u25a0 head, X meanwhile pouring ;> whisky
down its ' throat. : Slowly > the - horse re
gained consciousness amid the applause
of the spectators, who cheered lustily | for
Miss \ Dudley.' 'A" veterinary ; surgeon who
had: been" called, arriving later, said that
the â¢ nurse had \u25a0 done^ precisely the , right
thing for the horse's good. When asked
whether; she . had ever attended a * horse
before^ \ the nurse "smilingly replied: "Ob.
no; but , I * have ; attended many persona *
who .weire overcome by the heat, and.
really,' human beings and animals, I be

: M ensure \u25a0\u25a0 100,000 Miles in Diameter. ,
CAMBRIDGE. Mass.. July 18.â In Har
vard Observatory to-day It was said that
the sun spots now'excitlng great : interest
are . of ".unusual dimensions. When , they
first appeared on ' Friday . they were not
very i tangible, but they can .be plainly
seen : through smoked glass or even with
the naked eye when the, sun Is low."
Although Harvard observers here do
not pay much attention to this particular
phenomenon. ' they took photographs this
, '^Whether, the . hot weather la caused or
affected by sun spats," said Andrew P.
Gerlsh of l the observatory staffs *>re do
not? pretend to say. 'The sun spots on the
sun at 3 present are among . the largest
which 'have appeared In recent years, al
though ! they * probably^ cannot compare
'with ' those which appeared In ' 1392. , ' They
are, close together, somewhat above tha
and on < the right hand aide. They
are estimated to be 100,000 miles In diame
ter, twelve 'â¢ times jas \ great as " the earth.
These spots are supposed to be collection j
of I condensed gas containing solid matter,
but * scientists - are not : agreed and some
astronomers think the spots ; are depres
sions In the surface of. the sun for bodies
moving from the;earthto the sun."

President Believes Peace Negptiai:i*Gns Are
Progressing Satisfactorily. â¢
OYSTER BAY. K. V.. July 18.â No ad
. vices, either from this country or
abroad, have reached President Roose
velt which would warrant, even by in
direction, a pessimistic view of the re
eult of the 'forthcoming peace confer
ence- between the plenipotentiaries of
Russia and Japan. On the contrary, it
can be said that such advices as the
President has received indicate that a
sincere effort on the part of both bel
ligerents would be made to reconcile
their differences and negotiate a treaty
of peace that would be permanent.
The terms that Japan will propose
â¢ have not been made known, even to Mr.
Roosevelt, and they probably will not
be until the conference assembles as a
peace commission. That the terms will
not be drastic is believed generally in
administration circles.
It Is known that the President has
Intimated to the Japanese Government
his belief that an agreement with Rus-
Fia can be reached without serious dif
ficulty, provided Japan's terms are not
harsh, or of a kind serving to humiliate
her adversary.
The President has Indicated definitely
that his -work as an Intermediary be
tween Russia and Japan practically la
concluded. He is* gratified that he has
been able to bring the two belligerent
nations together- to -discuss and-con
sider their differences, with a view to
the negotiation of a treaty of peace.
I That he will have an active hand In the
. conference is regarded as Quite un
likely..

Baron Ha j n^'it Fears the Conference
Mny I'rov* .Ftttlle.
LONDON. July 18.â Baron Hayaehl. th<s
Japanese Minister here, said to-day that
Russia had appointed good men as peace
plenipotentiaries. Nei'ertheless. even M.
de Witte and. Baron Rosen " had not In
spired Japan with confidence in a favor
able outcome of the* negotiations. ,
"W* do not know,'* the Minister added;
"what powers have been delegated to them
and after the'evente of the past etehteen
months Japan puts faith only In accom-
pllshed^facts. -The term* will be commu
nicated only at the conference. "*.. en we
will discover what powers -the Russian
plenpipotentiaries possess.",
It was suggested to Hayashi that the
general opinion prevailed that the Japan
ese terms would be moderate. . ''
"I cannot see where people get * such
an idea," replied the Minister. "The pub
lic must take the Japanese for angels." '
Minister Hayashi intimated that Japan
was ready to continue the war unless
she obtained suitable 'terms. He called
attention to the fact that practically the
entire cum realized by the last two loans
waa unexpended and said the capture of
the island of SaghaHen waa not precipi
tated by the approach of the conference,
but was a natural sequence of the Japan
ese campaign, 'the. plans for.w.hlch had
not been altered since Russia acceded to
a conference. "An earlier attack on the
island was not undertaken, . principally
because of the nevere winter and because
the cummer season was. more preferable
for campaigning and for the establish
ment of a new government in the island.

OYSTER BAY. July 18:â President Roose
velt, has .disappeared into, the wilds.- , Not
since his .Colorado, bear hunt has -he been
so thoroughly lost from the world. He is
sleeping ' somewhere along the .wooded
jjhores of Long Island, on a blanket under
the stars,- while 'Archie dreams "of bears
and* Indians.'.. : - " ;* :~: ~ / - :
It'is the annual. 'camping' expedition' of
the Roosevelt children/ \u25a0 -'.-:, Each : summer
Mr. \u25a0: Roosevelt gives his children* a" taste
of life close to Mother Nature, teaching
themhow to pitch tents, cook meals and
look after- themselves, like 'pioneers in a
forest^" The . camp Js 'usually
pitched near -Lloyds "Neck, on : the S(Juhd:
Thl3-year the; destination -the expedi
tion" has been kept a' close , secret." T
At 3 r :o'clock this afternoon "the flotilla
set sail-^r, rather, oars. Four rowboats^
filled with 'expectant boys,' tents and ] all
sorts of things to eat, set out from/Oyster
Bay, in command of the President. The
boats were j manned by '^Theodore > Jr.;
Archie and Kermit: Roosevelt," \u25a0 "Jack,"
Philip and' George, sons of W. Emlen
Roosevelt, and' two : sons of Mrs. "J. West'
Roosevelt.- â¢' .' '" \u25a0 r '
Every ; bit- of work ' on the- expedition
will be&oiie bythe boys, from the.steer
ing "of the boats "to the washing^ of the
dishes. After landing oh the unknown
shore the tents/ were pitched and supper
probably* was cooked over campflres. The
President himself â¢ acts' as" supervising
chef.
After supper comes an hour -of story
telling, when -Mr.- Roosevelt, spins .yarna
about bears and mountain lions until- the
shadows- seem to -hide wild /beasts and
other terrors of the night. .^
All hands will sleeponrtbe ground. In
true- hunter fashion, .and Â«ome -of-, the
youngsters will. try in vain to sleep with
one eye open, like .the' traditional scout.
After a-'good .breakfast camp- will -be
broken and the boys ; willpuU for. home. ,
Poor little Quentiiv Roosevelt- will meet

At; this, -juncture, .the, parents of tne
young people -held a consultation, and it
was agreed ithat; the ,twb / should marry.
To this: arrangement: ( yqu;Â«si Wolfe -9b
jected arid 'soon ? afterward ;left; Ieft San Jose.
Meanwhile t the : girl's condition - became
such that' Dr. = Nlms was consulted .and
he was requested by the father to save
the \u25a0 girl's - reputation. . He, so - the father
alleges, at first refused, but upon -T the
pleadings of the girl relented and agreed
to j take care : of her and : have her ( sent (
to San Francisco for treatment. . */â¢
- After a: consultation ,of the. families
an arrangement was" made whereby Mrs.
Wolfe was -to pay J5O toward the care
of the, girt-in San Francisco. It was also;
arranged' that: she should be sent toa
v.'bman on Market street, but the woman I
refused to receive, her unless Mrs. Cun
\u25a0ninsham came .with. her. The mother j
refused to consent to this arrangement*
and then Dr. Nims* agreed to take charge |
of; the case. * \u25a0
TAKES GIRL AWAY.
The/ father, consenting to any ar
rangement to save the family., honor,
gave his daughter, into the hands of Dr.
Nims without Question- and - under the
supposition that she would be taken to
a sanitarium in this ': city. . He told the
doctor that no expense Should be spared
and that she should have the best of
care. And so he parted . with the girl,
who was at that time in' a serious con
dition, without" ascertaining. where she
was going. According; to the father,
who still shields ..Dr.~N4ms, it was the
doctor who suggested the sanitarium In
order .to -avoid notoriety and, spoke of
the seriousness. of the girl's condition.
: At this .juncture of the Inquisition
In the Coroner's office, several pointed
questions relative to the father^ part
In the tragedy were asked by Deputy
McCormick and Cunningham grew
more indignant over them than over a
description of his daughter's , brutal
treatment. "- On one occasion it looked
as if the enraged father would strike
the deputy. From the time Dr. Nlms
name was mentioned, the father's an
swers became evasive and he showed a
great desire to talk of his Implicit
trust in the physician. v \u25a0
SQUALID QUARTERS.
The offices of Dr. Thomas, from
which the body of Miss Cunningham
was taken, consist of .two rooms, -. di
vided by a folding door. The y front
room, occupied by the doctor. ; faces
McAllister street and the furniture Is
threadbare and the : surroundings
dingy. The inner room where Miss
Cunningham died, is half filled by the
bed. Is in serai-darkness' and wholly
unventllated. The entire place is
squalid and filthy. Although Dr. Thom
as has been practicing as a physician
and- is registered at the City Hall, he
was unable to give the ' name of the
college at -which he was; a- student and
evaded the question by saying that he
is ah eclectic doctor.
At the time of Miss Cunningham's
death, Thomas had- as an assistant a
middle-aged woman who acted- as a
nurse to Miss Cunningham. V Her claim
to proficiency as a nurse I was I based
upon "her caring; for an old lady for
three â¢ years prior to being with Dr,
Thomas. She admitted that she did not
know how. to take-a-patient'S'tempera
ture and; this incompetency,, was suffi
cient.to help T .b.rln.sr r oiv,the girl'Â» death.
,At;the .time, the; Deputy Coroner,, ar-,
rived at .the doctor's offices, there ,yras
some difficulty, in finding 1 the girl's, ef
fects, but they were .finally located,
and removed.' Yesterday afternoon the

Phillip of Saxe-Coburg.and

GOTHA. Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and
Gotha. July IS.â Prince Phillip of Saxe-
Coburg and Gotha to-day filed at the
Provincial Court a petition for a divorce
from his wife, the Princess Louise of
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.
Prinress Louise is tne oldest daughter
of the IClngr of the Belgians. In-1597 she
oloped with Count yon Matassoch-Kelge
vitch. a lieutenant of Austrian cavalry.
H<?r subsequent confinement in a sani
tarium and escape from her attendants
caused sensations. A medical commission
in Paris recently declared the Princess to
be sane and two days later it was an
nounced that Prince Phillip had decided
to bepin proceedings for a divorce which,
should he win. would relieve him of pay
ins the Princess an allowance of $15,000
yearly upon which she had been living
in Paris. On the other hand, it was
pointed out that winning the suit also
might be disadvantageous to the Prince,
a? the Princess might put in a counter
ciaim on account of her confinement in a
panitarlum.

Fighting With Insane Offi

TEIES TO MURDEE
CAPTAIN DAHLLOF
Though Manacled, Madman
Holds Crew at JBay. With an
Ax, Then Jumps Over board,
but Is Rescued by Sailors
The codflshlngr schooner Czarina, . which
arrived yesterday from Pirate Cove,
brought from the North a thrilling story
of a battle with a mutinous mate. Re
volvers, handcuffs, straltjackets and
knives figure in the yarn/ The desperate
mate attempted the murder of the captain,
then tried to commit suicide, and; his he
roic rescue followed. Manacled, -the .vil
lain, armed with an ax, held the crew
at bay, but finally he was overcome. On
shore he was arrested, but there "was a
dramatic turning of the tables, for the
villain. went free, and instead- the men
he had attacked were heavily mulcted by
a Judge who hunts diligently for fine
money.
The Czarina left here April 1 in com
mand of Captain Dahllof for, Pirate Cove
to bring home a cargo of codfish. Captain
Small, superintendent of the Union Fish
Company, was a passenger, and there
were several women on board, relatives
of company officials. For mateÂ»Captain
Dahllof had his dear friend, Johnson,
whose first name nobody on board seems
to remember.
Johnson weighs 225 pounds, and the
Czarina^ was barely outside the Heads
when he..J)egan to exhibit dangerous ten
dencies.. First one and then another of
the crew was threatened with irons, and
when one youthful seaman did not steer
to suit Johnson's ideas, the mate, when
the man was relieved from the wheel,
showed him a sharp knife and remarked
that unless the sailor had a care the
mate would be compelled to slice away
his liver, heart and a few other Internal
organs that are necessary to the comfort
even of poor steersmen.
MATE GROWS UGLY.
. As the voyage progressed - Johnson's
ugly moods became more frequent. He
abused the sallorsÂ«and openly defied the
paptaln. He was always careful, how
ever,'to be good when any of the women
passengers were on deck, and later this
gallantry, or.whatever.it was, stood him
in good stead.
The climax was reached just before the
Czarina arrived at Dory Harbor, where
she called for salt in which to pack her
cargo of codfish. One afternoon Johnson
flung open the door of Captain Dabllof's
cabin, walked in, slammed the door,
locked It and put <a revolver to the skip
per's head. Just what happened in the
cabin the captain will not tell, but ac
cording to the tale told on board John
son handed the captain' another revolver
and told him to defend himself.
There was a terrific struggle, and In
a. few minutes Captain Bahllof rushed
on deck crying tor help. -Johnson fol
lowed. -
"Put ,the nate in irons, men," the
skipper ordereu", "and look out for
yourselves; ho has two guns."
Only too delighted to have authority
from headquarters to give Johnson a
rouKh time, half a dozen snen soon
had the struggling executive officer in
their grrasp, and within a few mlnute.s
he was tightly Ironed."
"1 will submit," remarked the matÂ«
from the stanchion to which he was
lashed, "but I would liko to go to my
own room."
Captain Duhllo* told him that he had
no objections providlQ he made no noise
and discontinued the use of foul lan
guage. ; Johnson promised, and was led
by tiie manacled wrists to his room and
there locked in. His hands were ironed
together in front, and in v few minutes
there can:e from the room a series of
crashes which mounded as if the jfkint
there confined was tearing? the ship to
pieces. . , - 1"
HOLDS CHEW AT BAY. .
"Get him out. of there." ordered the
captain
"He Has a chest against the door,"
reported a seaman. '
"Smash in the door," the captain
commanded.
"Better not," came from the impris
oned mate. "I have au :\x â hear it?"
And crash went some more of the own
er's property. "See it?', and out through
the bulkhead came a coiner of the
sharp steel head. yTho first man that
tries to enter this room dies. Go away.
Leave" me alone. If you value your lives
leave me."
â¢Somebody suggested the window. .As
aj3nilor's hand opened thu large, square
portholf down came the ax,' ; and ' the
sailor withdrew his hand with one fin
ger split from knuckle to nail and
blood spurting '.ike the spout from " a
miniature whale. . \u25a0'\u25a0â¢\u25a0 â¢'." . - .' â¢ ,-wv'
Sailorsare nothing if not resource
ful.
"Get a capstan bar, and we'll make
jelly of ,ht:n and his ax." suggested
somebody. And within a few minutes
the window had been Dattered in'.ViCori
nered. in the sni ; \l! room, ;witbin easy
reach of the bar., the matt- stood 'at
bay. He realized that he .'was over
whelmed, and n-hen homebody said, "Bo
a yentleman, Vonson, and yump out
here."* Johnson "yumped.*'
He was put in a; : stniltjacket and
stowed away in the forecastle. In an
hour, or two he appeared \ on deck wi tli
the rihhoned remains ' of | his.; restrainer
dandling over Lis arms. ; He was seized
and ironed a^ain. This time the hands
were fastened behind the back.

SHOCK TO THE CTVENTOR. i
j Professor Montgomery, the inventor of
[ the aeroplane, was dazed by ike accident.
! He was near the ex>ot where Maloney felL
! Friends took him in charge and led him
!to the college hospitaL Crying and
! moatilng. Professor Montgomery sail
! after the accident: "My God, it is aw
j fuL The rope caught and the wing
â¢I crumpled and he felL TVhat will bis
'mother say?*' ;: ip/t*"*
Asked what will be the f nture cf - the
aeroplane tbrs afternoon, the professor
said: ""I -cannot sayâ l cannot say. It
may never go up again."
; The aeroplane was Santa Clara Xo. L
with which Maloney 'had made the sac
cessful Sight at Santa Clara College on
S April Zi before members : of the press
I from all over the. State. On May 21 he
gave aa exhibition of the aeroplane, but
when up about 150 feet a guy rope be
came entangled. Maloney .landed suc
cessfully, and it was thea believed to
have been demonstrated that under any
: circumstance the aeroplane would right
itself In falling. That same afternoon he
gave another Sight, but the rope became
entangled and Maloney was carried some
miles south of tbe city and landed when
the balloon came down. At Oakland on
June U, in arranging for a flight, the hot
air balloon exploded. An attempt was
made to give an exhibition here on July
*, but it was found impossible to fill the
balloon with gas to make the ascension.
Last Saturday an exhibition of the aero
plane was to have been given at Agri
cultural â¢ Park, but a roj>e again became
entangled and Maloney could not cut the
aeroplane loose, and came down with tbe
balloon." v , .
VEaDICT AT THE JAQUEST.
Maloney had been In the employ of
Professor Montgomery ever since the in
vention of 1 tbe aeroplane, making the
first trial tests. He took as much in
terest in it as the inventor. Last even
teg he toM some of the cadets,' "Wait
till to-morrow and I will show you a
sensational Sight. The others .have been
spoiled by accident, bat to-zaprrow It
will be all right and then we will take
tbe machine to Sacramento."
Maloney was raised in 3an Francisco.
His mother, sister and a brother reside
at yjT Church street. He was regarded
hÂ» one of the most skilled and daring of
aeronauts and had made many ascensions
before his engagement with - Prof eesor
Montgomery.
Lawrence de Falco, who filled : the
balloon, to-night eaid that he shouted to
Maloney that tbe rope had caught,- but
the aeronaut paid, no attention, if he
beard him.
"Even if he did see" it," said De Falco,
"he would not have cared, because he
would have taken all kinds of chances
rather than fall to-day." -'
This evening Coroner Kell held an in
quest on Maloney*s remains, when , the
following verdict was rendered:
"That Daniel J. Maloney, a native of
California, 23 or 27 years of age, came
to his death at Santa Clara College,' July
IS. 19Q6, from injuries received in falling
to tbe earth with an aeroplane while at
tempting to make an ascension, and we,
tbe Jury, exonerate Professor J. J. Mont
gomery from all blame."
Maloney's body is lying at undertaking
parlors in Santa Clara. The time for the
funeral has not yet been set.

DIPOETAXT RULING
OX 3IIXIXG CLAIMS
Discover}' of 3lineral Xeces
sary to Validity in Alaska,
Says Judge.
TACOMA, July lg. â An important de
cision affecting the mining interests of
Alaska has been rendered by Judge
Wickersbam at Fairbanks. Miners
there believe it will do more toward
the development of the resources of
that country than anything else which
has occurred within recent years. The
judgment will result In developing the
country by compelling men who lay
claim to mineral ground to dig Into it
In order to make good their rights.
The posting of a notice of location Is
no longer sufficient. Judge Wicker
cham defines the rights of the miner
erd locator in unmistakable terms, as
follows:
. Discovery of mineral Is necessary to the
validity of a placer mining claim. If staking
and recording shall follow after the datÂ« of
the discovery tfcey relate back to tha discov
ery, and. In caee no Intervening rights have
attached. r*riect the claim as of that date.
Bst It is not Bo with the discovery If acts
of staking and recording arÂ« performed first.
ma in this case, and discovery last, the va
lidity and life of the claim begin only with
the discovery. The greatest evtl In the ad-
XEisistraUon of mining law in Alaska is the
habit of tie ebiftiess In staking and record
ing claims, generally by power of attorney.
vhereby on* person out of ten acquires a claim
to a large area of supposed mineral landj
and excludes the Trilling miner from working
it a=d developing the resources of the Ter
ritory. Since the threat of lawsuit lurks be
fclr.d each of these pretending locations, the
prospector generally passes it by. and thus
the speculative locator control* the property.

LOS ANGELAS. July IS.â Reports have
been received here from attorneys \u25a0who

men will not be prosecuted and will short
ly be released from custody. Both men

weeks, being. unable Â£o furnish the heavy

It is stated that an agreement has been
reached between the former officers of
the* bank and the depositors, by the terms
of which the latter will recevle a large
proportion of their deposits. The details
of the settlement has not been made
public.
At tbe time of the failure of the bank
the total deposits were given as $78,
â¬â¬2 T2, while the cash balance on hand was
only SSI 05. It Is Intimated ' that influ
ential frienfls of the two men have come
to their rescue and furnished funds that
will esable them to make at least a par
tial restitution.

DARK PICTURE
OF CALIFORNIA
Dr. Lindley of the Wliittier
School Scores 3lethods of
Caring for \- Dependents
PRESENTS STATISTICS
He Addresses the : National
Convention Holding Its
Session in Exposition City
PORTLAND, Or.. July IS. â At the
general session to-day of the confer
ence on Charities and Corrections.
"Defectives" and "Children" were the
principal topics discussed. ISach paper
or report was discussed fiom every
standpoint by the dele-grates.
Dr. Walter Undtay, 'superintendent of
the Whittier Reform School in Califor
nia, painted, a dark picture of the con
dition of attains in that State. He stated
that California maintained 7&QI depend
ent children !a*>t year. at. a cos=t of near
ly 1500.000. He assorted that the uues
tion was a grave. one, an.l that thu au
thorities of the State were far from a
solution of the problem.
The topic "Defectives" was intro
duced by Dr. K. A. Tomlinson of St.
Peter, Minu.. chairman of the commit
tee on defectives. Ke discussed at
length the importance of investigating:
the physical conditions o! defectives as
a basis for their rational care and treat
ment. Dr. Tomlinson said In part:
In the organization of our institution (or the
care of detectives It -Is of primary Importance
that due provision should be made for the
thorough investigation ol physical conditions
associated with mental delect and the peda
gogic aspect of the work should be supple
mentary rather than dominant, as it Is now.
That these same methods should apply to
the work in our hospitals tor the' lnsane ought
to be obvious. And yet, in all of the litera
ture of philanthropic effort for the betterment
cf the care of the insane, the question has
practically always been considered from the
etandpolnt of the chronic, quiet and well be
haved dement.
Much has been Eald In the direction of pro
viding room and agreeable surrounding's for
the chronic, quiet and well behaved . patient,
but practically nothing is said about, or
thought of, the proper provision for the dis
turbed patient, e-lther acute or chronic The
difficulties that have arisen and still persist
ar* due to the retention of the asylum regime
and the effort to make it applicable to the
performance of hospital work.
It would seem that what is needed Is a more
active interest on tie part of those engaged
In philanthropic effort toward the education
of public opinion to the appreciation of th*
Importance of the provUlon of room and facil
ities in our institutions for the care of tne
defective, for the Investigation of the physical
conditions associated with mental defects, and
the development of methods for the care of the
feeble-minded and the Insane that shall have
for their object the provision of a sound body
as the basis for the cultivation of Imperfectly
developed or the restoration of lost mental ca
pacity. â¢._.;â¢
COXDITIOA" S. IX CAI .IFORXI A.
The discussion on this topic was led by
C C. Krauskop of Maywood. 111.
Dr. Hastings Hart of Chicago, super
intendent of the Illinois Children's Home
and Aid Society, read a paper on "The
Juvenile Reformatory of the Twentieth
Century."
"A Plea for \u25a0 Esthetic Surroundings"
was the subject of the address of George.
Vaux Jr.. director of the Philadelphia
House of Refuge.
At the sectional meeting, which had
under consideration the subject of de
fectives. Dr. Richard Dewey of Wauwa
tosa, ."Vyis., delivered an address on "Aft
ercare "of the Convalescent Insane."
- "Child Saving Agencies -of the Pacific
States" was the subject of an address In
troduced by W. T. Gardner, superintend
ent of the Boys* and Girls' Aid Society
of Oregon. \u25a0
Dr. Walter Llndley of Los Angeles.
CaL, president of the Whlttler State Re
form School of California, followed with
a paper on "The Evils of
Childhood-" -Dr. LJndley stated that the
best the State can do to help the children
Is to foster the home and the home spirit.
There should be organized assistance pro
vided for Indigent widows left with chil
dren, by cash ftllowance If .necessary, so
that they could keep their children at
home while small and helpless. x
He spoke of the wholesale bath, the
wholesale meal, the wholesale prayer, the
wholesale even-song and the wholesale
love of the institution. The public Insti
tution a necessity to be utilized as little
as possible. .
KXOR3IOITS SUM SPKXT.
Dr. Lindley showed how California
and New York were far behind many
other States in their effort to place
children In homes. In Michigan, with
a population of 2,500.000, there were 200
children In institutions and 1486 "In
family homes under State supervision,
while In California, with a population
of 1,600,000 at the same date, there
were 922 orphans, 3559 half orphans,
412 abandoned children and 201 found
lings, a total of 5394 in the California
orphans* homes at an annual cost of
$349,397 90. In addition to these there
were under the supervision of the
State through the boards of Supervis
ors 154 orphans, 2169 half-orphans and
84 abandoned children, for the care of
which the State paid, for the year end
ing June 30. 1904, $105,475 04. This
makes the number of dependent child
ren cared for by the State of California
for the last ! fiscal â¢- year 7801, at a cost
to -the State of $454,872 94. In order
to prevent any correction of thislam
entable condition, Lindley said v the
Legislature creating the California
State Board of Charities- carefully pro
vided that they should have nothing to
do with the orphanages. In conclusion
the speaker said:
Yet I must not leave you to-night with a
dark Impression of California. God forbid!
Tfcisfls only a temporary blot on -the escutch
eon put there by man's miefuided hand.
The work of this section concluded
with tbe address of Migar T.LDavies,
chief State" Factory Inspector of Chi
cago. Davies' subject was "Necessity
for Further Preventive and . Protective
Child Labor Laws." ,

LIGHT THROWN

Mrs. Hueter Confesses to an
Intimacj 7 Between Hersell
and Hi Young Physician
INQUIRY TO PROCEED
Her Husband Known -to Have
Been Aware of Her Actions
on the Day of the; Shooting
Special Dis patch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 18.â Mrs. ; Kate Hueter,'
who is being held pending an.lnvestiga
tion Into the death of her husband, Gus
tav Hueter, has confessed to Sheriff Ross
that for ; the past six' mbritns she ' was
unfaithful. She names a young physician
as the person with whom she; consorted:
This is : now believed Vto i have I been V the
cause | of the Quarrel between -the-couple
which had cuch a tragic ; ending.'^To
morrow , morning the Grand ; ; Jury t will
begin an Investigation ( of the crime, :;and
It is believed that some_ startlllng ~dls
closures will i be made.'
Hueter was aware j of 'the { unfaithful
ness of his wife j; ; and he and j his .son,
Albert. Hueter, were preparing '-to "set a
trap to catch the woman and her lover.
Albert Hueter. first discovered the unv
faithfulness of his stepmother last Wed
nesday. â¢ . Hueter : ; was .away from : *ncime
and was not expected back until Thurs-;
day. Th son had occasion ~to visit \u25a0 his
father's house, which is only a quarter of
a mile distant from his own place.'-' Un-^.
known to his stetpmother he entered the
house and discovered j the woman alone
with her. physician. The son quietly with-,
drew and called in the Japanese servant.
Together a they gained [ the knowledge /to
prove : the' KUilt of Mrs. Hueter.
The son was loath to tell his father of
the matter, but on Friday morning as
Gustav Hueter was hitching up to drive
to San Jose, the son told his father the |
story- The old man was slow to believe '>
ft, but the evidence was positive.. The
father and son planned to; set a trap to.
catch the": woman/ \u25a0 ' .. .. * .=. \\
Hueter, agreed to say , nothing -about
the affair, but to go about his .-business
as usual. Hueter was snot and killed
that very night .after a" stormy scene
with -his wife. -
"\u25a0When we were first marned I thought
much of Mr. Hueter," the woman said to
Sheriff Ross. "Later, however, I tired
of him aud about six months ago I went
to San Francisco with my physician. We
remained there for a couple of days.:
Once since then we went to the city.
On that occasion I remained longer than
I intended and Mr. Hueter came up for
me. 'He bad no suspicion of the relations
existing between me and my physician.
Wednesday night was the first time that
the doctor came to our house. We
thought no one' suspected us. but either
the kid (referring to the son) or the
Jap must have known of our intimacy."
Hueter probably was enraged over this
matter and when he returned home from
San Jose Friday night he probably took
his wife to task. This, however, Mrs.
Hueter denies . and sticks to her first
story about the row. She still claims
she shot in self-defense.

GAYLEY'S PLANS FOR AIDING SCHOLARS
IN RESEARCHES TAKE SHAPE.
Eminent Berkeley Educator Leaves for Belgium to Attend
Congress Called as the Result of His Efforts.
BERKELEY, July 18.â Having accept
ed an invitation from the Belgian Gov
ernment to take part as an American del
egate in an important international con
gress at L.kÂ£e, Professor Charles MHI3
Gayley, head of the English department
In tha University of California, left
Berkeley to-day from Europe. He will
be absent for two months. Professor
<Jaylcy has been delegated by the Unit
ed States Government, with two other
scholars of this eountrjv to represent
America at this international congress,
the object of which is the reproduction
of old manuscripts, coins and seals.
The holding of this congress represents
the consummation of a plan which has
been a favorite project of Professor Gay
ley for a number of years. The Califor
fornia scholar is responsible for the agi
tation of the matter which has now re
sulted in the call for the congress. It
has been Professor Gayley's â¢ hope
to make more accessible to scholars
all historical and literary treasures
of the world. To examine these
at present involves a great expense in
time and money of a Journey to the li
brary or museum whore the particular
treasure is housed. What is proposed is
to found an institution through the
endeavors of which fac-similes of manu
scripts, rare books, public records, and
texts may be made and distributed to
libraries throughout the world.
PnOFESSOH'S 31ISSIOX.
The university authorities Issued to-day
an explanatory statement regarding
Professor Gayley's mission, which in part
is as follows:
Tnt Belgian Government, through the De
lÂ«rtmeM. ol State of the United States, tx
iendf-d invitations to be present at this Con
gress 40 frott-sEor Charles Mills Gayley of thu

Mr. iMinam wjlll be unable to attend. P. Lice
l'hllili-'e, chief of the division of maps and
chart* In the Library of Congress, will go tn
Mr. Putnam's stead, and the two other dele
gates will be Professor Gayley and Dr. Bill-
the calling of this international congress of
scholars by the Belgian Government in
connection with the Universal and In
ternational Exposition to be held at Liege
ihi* summer has bt-en preceded by a \u25a0world
wide aeiiation. Within the last year there
have been published in the New York Evening
Post Cozens of letters from librarians and
scholars in all part* of this country and. in
deed, in Europe, discussing the advisability of
ca international movement for the preservation
cT bibliographical treasures. These letters were
all written by way or comment upon a plan
proposed by Professor Gayley in the issue of
the New York Evening Post for November 19.
IWA. The Belgian Government has taken thÂ«
Initiative in this most important matter in
caJilng the present congress, which will be at
tended by scholars of high repute from ail over
the world. J. de Trooz. Minister of the Inte
rior and of Public Instruction In Belgium, has
expressed in a letter to the members of the
Belgian Commission of Organization, the pur
poses of the movement as follows: . â¢
FOR HISTORIC STUDY.
"For propagation of historic study, paleo
graphic, arcfaaeoloÂ«ic and artistic, by the
handling of coins, medals and seals, as well
as additional and Indispensable study of book*
and treat if>eÂ« of professor*
"Not every one can have access to collec
tions of these documents, and though the loan
of them is to-day more easily gained than for
merly, from libraries and often from private
sources, these means, Hben^ as they may be.
must from necessity be restricted- There al
ways will be & large number of preclouÃ docu
ments which cannot under any pretext leave
the depositories where they are kept with leai
ols care.
"Happily the ceaseless proEress of modern
enterprise will admit supplying the originals
up to a certain point.
"The recent accident to the National Li
brary of Turin call* the attention of the schol
arly world to the urgent necessity imposed
upon all Government* of taking prompt meas
ure* for the preservation of their collections
Irom to dire a misfortune. On all sides they
are considering the reproducing of valuable
documents bo that In case of accident all
should not be lost.
"To this end It would be desirable to bring
about an International agreement, or at least
take the advice of competent men, and of all
interested In the preservation of literary and
artistic documents of the past." . '
The congress, which will be held on Au
gust 21-23, Is to be under the patronage
of Messrs. Jules de Trooze, Minister of
the Interior and of Public Instruction,
and Gustavo Francotte, Minister of Com
merce and Labor of Belgium. The Bel

scribed $900, which is one-half the cost
of the bridge. The Supervisors of San
Mateo County will now be asked to con
tribute the other half of the cost of the
construction of the bridge.

acres -has already been subdivided and
re-sold In residence sites. In opening
this part of San Mateo County and plac

PLEADS FOR EQUAL
TREATMENT TO ALL
Congressman :Townsend Says
\u25a0 f Only One Way to Settle
Eate Problem. - :
TOLEDO. Ohio, July 13.â "The welfare
of the railroads and. the welfare of . the
people of this country . depend on an early
and fair and Just ! settlement of the. rate
problem.There may rbe a compromise,
but there cannot be a compromise of
principle. The law calls for a fair and a
Just rate to all, and that is the only set
tlement, on which the people will make
an ; agreement." So spoke Congressman
Charles E. .Townsend of Michigan to the
members of the National Hay. Association.
In convention in -this city to-day. He
continued:
Her* is a case that came- before ru i las.
year It is possible to ship 100 pounda i of cot
ton goods from Chicago to Boston for *1 -Z A
shipment of the same from Chicago to salt
Lake City costs *2 50. A ehlppÂ«r would be
saving money by sending his goods from Boston
to San Francisco and then to Salt Lake City.
: There are two parties ' to the freight rate
contract, the railroads, and the people. T^e
trouble in the past has been that Judges neia
the individual and corporation as equai. Thia
Is wrong. In my opinion. The railroads have
been given power to condemn property for t&elr
right of way. to' force you to sell out; they
have even been . given land They have the
better of. the individual in almdst every way.

HUSBAND UNABLE TO AID
Two Men Who Had Called
Her Wife Fail to Meet the
Claims of Undertakers
The remains of Mrs. Frances J. Bur
ton, who was divorced shortly before her
death from one Dr. J. J. Leek, but was
said to have married J. Burton, a race
track man, will be saved from a grave in
the Potter's field by the sale of a scant
1200 worth of jewelry which she had
pa-wned at a local store. Since her death
on Friday the body has lain in the par
lors of the United Undertakers, 566 Mis
sion street, and neither Burton nor Dr.
Leek have offered to pay the burial ex
penses
The woman was reputed wealthy, but
when she died, besides the jewels In
pawn, she left but a few tawdry plated
chains and paste stones. Dr. Leek
claims that she owned $3000 worth of dia
monds and that she was seen wearing
them during: the last month, but none
were found among her effects when the
Public Administrator searched the rooms
Bhe occupied at SSI O'Farrell street. Bur
ton claims to be without funds and, while
Leek lived with the woman for years,
he says that so long as he is divorced
from her. the law car.not compel him to
pay burial fees. Sentiment does not seem
to enter into his consideration of the
matter.
To-day the body will be Interred in a
grave which is not furnished by the city,
but which will be paid for with the
money that the dead woman's rings
bring.
Mrs. Burton was doing business as a
"ladles* specialist" and called herself
Mrs. Dr. Davies. She and Leek operatec
in one office as Dr. and Mrs. Davies,
while Just across the hall Leek
advertised and did business as an
"electric sign" dentist. Leek admitted
yesterday that they were engaged in
business and used the two names for
business reasons. He said that the for
mer Mrs. Leek masqueraded under sev
eral aliases, both here and in the
the East, and that she was "croked." He
claims to have gotten a divorce from her
and married another woman, but permit
ted her to call at his office afterward be
cause they were still friends.

dressed the quarterly meeting of the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday, giv
ing: an account of the labors of his

the first half of 1902 the local real es
tate sales aggregated 23.376,343; in the
first half of ISOS he showed they
reached 129.4C8.253, and among the con
tributing causes of the great increase
in the real estate transactions he said

The exports and imports of 1902 (in
cluding treasure) amounted to $109,
223.713. while in 1904 they reached
$160,275,338. and thus far the record
for 1905 makes a still better propor

For the eleven months ending May,
1905. there was a gain of $15,544,369 in
exports and $8,402,362 in Imports over
the same period in 1903-4.
Bunker said the Chamber of Com
merce had worked for the State at
larg-e and for the Pacific Coast as well
as for San Francisco.

Last Sunday afternoon while Abe
Ruef was taking dinner at his home he
\u25a0was startled by the cry of fire coming
from a woman who ran out from a
house on Francisco street, in the rear
of his residence on Lombard street.
Ruef rushed to the scene of the fire,
which was in the basement of the house,
and succeeded In extinguishing the
flames before the arrival of the engines.
He, however, ruined a fine pair of
trousers, which he had added to his
wardrobe only the day before.

AROUSES WRATH
OF THE MAYOR
League's Band Wagon Makes
Great Commotion at Euef
Headquarters, City Hall
LAST CALL TO REGISTER
Enrollment for the Primary
Election Will Close To-
Night at Hour of Twelve
There was a little- clash yesterday be
tween State Senator George B. Keane,
the Mayor's secretary, and Perry New
berry, chief of the Registration Bureau. of
the San Francisco Republican League.
The executive committee of. the: league
having resolved that special effort should
be made to bring about a large registration
of citizens for the primary election on
August 8, authorized ;Mr. Newberry to
engage a band, transparencies and wagon
to parade the streets. -.On the'transpar
ency was the sign: "All the grafters will
vote. What will you do?" .The wording
did not please the Mayor, hence he in
structed Mr. Keane to ring up the Re
publican League and say that If the
wagon was not called In at once and the
offensive transparency destroyed the
driver would be arrested.
The parley between the Mayor's secre
tary and the representative of the league
was conducted dyer the telephone. \u25a0; Mr.
Keane insisted that the permit, for. the
wagon was obtained under false pre
tenses, as the band leader who procured
it represented that ' the purpose was ,to
advertise a political meeting, whereas, In
fact, the wagon was being used to cast
odium on the Schmitz administration. Mr.
Newberry contended that the administra
tion was not mentioned; that there was
nothing on the transparency designating
the Mayor as a grafter. The citizens were
simply advised that all the grafters
would vote., Mr. Newberry asked Mr.
Keane if the Mayor regarded that in
scription as a personal Insult. The secre
tary's reply was not directly responsive,
yet he insisted that the wagon should be
called in, threatening immediate- arrest of
the driver 'if the parade was not- called
off.
BAXD STILL PLAYS.
Newberry told the secretary to go ahead
with the arrest. At last accounts the
wagon was moving and the band was
playing. The wheels of the wagon will
move to-day and the union musicians
aboard of the vehicle will play patriotic
airs. All the people of the town who
want to see the sign may see it. It reads:
"All the grafters will vote. What will
you do?"
Registration will, close to-night at 11
o'clock. Every citizen who is unregistered
should have his name properly enrolled
on the register. The grafters in the main
are registered, and those of the graft
persuasion who are not will i endeavor to
get in votes by fraud. . The Republican
League urges upon citizens to observe
the important duty of registration. The
grafters will make a desperate effort to
retain their hold on municipal affairs,
therefore it is essential that good citizens
should register and vote in order to over
come the forces of graft and boodle.
The executive committee of the Repub
lican League met last night at the head
quarters at 636 Market street and con
ferred with the chairmen of the respect
ive Assembly district committees. The
purpose of the conference was -to request
the nomination ,of delegates in time to
have the names printed on -the official
tally sheet. The executive committee
hopes that all the tickets \u25a0 will be ready
for filing by next Tuesday. Some of the
district leaders fancied it would be ad
visable to hold off until the opposition
disclosed its hand.
The belief is growing stronger that the
league tickets' will' win 'out in nearly all
of the districts. The opposition Is not
formidable . in more than four or five
places. In the Twenty-eighth, Thirty
ninth, Forty-second and Forty -fifth dis
tricts followers of Ruef are 1 organized.
They express confidence in their ability
to win In the Forty-fifth District.
There is a rumor to the effect that H.
J. Pcrazzl, Ruef's county commltteeman
in the Forty-first, is talking of putting up
a delegate ticket in opposition to . the
league club of that district. Colonel J. C.
Currier is the chairman of the league
club in the Forty-first District. The only
danger in the Forty-first lies in over
confidence. ' The members of the league
may be so sure of victory that th.ey will
not regard it necessary to vote.
ACH AIOIXG RUEF.
In the Fortieth . Assembly District,
Henry Ach Is . endeavoring to organize"
opposition to the Republican League.
Sharp practice was resorted to in order
to get up a meeting. In the County Com
mittee Ach proposed that the. district
county commltteemen should take charge
of the campaign in their respective dis
tricts, but his proposition was' rejected
by a vote of 64 to 17. Nevertheless he
used ths name of the County Committee
to assist in organizing opposition to the
league. An attempt j was also ! made -to
mislead the citizens *of the district by
the use of the following paragraph in the
call for an opposition meeting: "The.
United Republican League Club, we are,
assured, will affiliate . with the club to
be organized." The United League went
out of business two years ago and it la
obvious that the term "league" was em
ployed to create the Impression that the
San Francisco Republican League, which
has a strong following in the- district,
was favorable " to j the | meeting.. \u25a0 â¢ The op
position ' club was organized, at; Franklin
Hall last nisrht. John Henderson was
elected president of â¢ the club; -W. L.
Asher, vice president; Emll C. Kahn, sec
retary, and A. A. Powers, treasurer.
A committee on nomination of delegates
to be voted on at primaries was > then
elected. It is composed of M. L. Asher,
A. A. Powers, Gus Hartman, George
Mere- and, M. D. Cohn. > Short speeches
were made by Henry Ach, John Hender
son, M. L. Asher, - Assemblyman Hart^
man and A. A. Powers. .The: meeting waa
enlivened by music and recitations by J.

Southern Cotton Growers
WASHINGTON, July 18.-The resigna
tion of John Hyde, statistician and
Chief of the Bureau of Statistics of the
Department of Agrricultufe, was hand
ed to Secretary Wilson torday and prompt
ly accepted. Wlllett'N. Hays, the assis
tant Secretary, of ; Agriculture, has been
placed in oharsre of the. bureau temporar
ily. Secretary WHsoii'and other/ officials
of the ' department . eald | that}' Hyde' had
not been Implicated; in any manner in
the Irregularities that . resulted In jhe
dismissal of Edwin S. Holmes, the asso
ciate statistician, whom - secret | service
operatives charged with being guilty of
having given to brokers advance figures
on cotton crops statistics. :>
In his letter j to. the "Secretary, Hyde
takes notice of, the fact that he will
be criticized, for resigning under, fire and
In defense says there j has never - been a
time when he was not. under fire. He de
clares that an organization (meaning the
cotton growers), Is bent' upon getting
him out of . the Government service, and
that his health will not permit him to
continue so unequal a struggle. . ;/
There Is considerable speculation as to
the probable successor* of Hyde. One
name suggested Is that of B. W. Snow of
Chicago, statistician for well-known
farm Journals and once an assistant stat
istician under J. B, Dodge, chief* of the
bureau, about twelve years ago. Dodge,
was In charge at the time the pres
ent system of gathering \u25a0 crop statistics
was devised. J J Henry ' Hester, secretary
of the New Orleans Cotton Exchange.
In a conversation with Secretay Wilson,
contended that the salary paid by the
department was ' Inadequate to get the
right kind of men for - the place.
Hyde, at his house, to-night, said that
he felt be had cast an Immense bur
den from Wb shoulders. He had fully in
tended to resign some time during the
coming autumn, he said, and therefore he
had only advanced his resignation by a
few weeks. , Hyde, said that* even now
that he was out' of -office, ; net. would,
if called upon, -be only too happy., to con
tribute In any way -his aid In the Inves
tigation. . : -.. ,
TO PROMOTE COTTON GROWING.
British Association Start* Movement to
Interest the Colonies.
WASHINGTON. July 18â An apparently
well organized movement started by | the
cotton manufacturers of Great Britain to
encourage the growth of cotton In the
British possessions and countries other
than the United States Is reported, to the
Department of Commerce and Labor by
Consul Halstead at Birmingham,- Eng
land. This movement Is being directed by
the British/Cotton; Growing Association
and. was started to liberate the British
cotton trade from he danger, of American
speculators. The demand for cotton stead
ily increases, but, so far,' the Consul says,
there has been no j corresponding' develop
ment of the sources of supply. The huge
crop produced in the United States has
relieved the' situation," but American
planters, the report points out, desire to
maintain prices by reducing the produc
tion. .. .:--\u25a0- t,\ -.\u25a0\u25a0.:\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0:./\u25a0.:\u25a0-.>-. \u25a0â¢\u25a0i\ '\u25a0. . \u25a0

REGISTER TO-DAY.
THE primary election will be held on the Bth of August. The
registration of voters closes to-nighi Unless a citizen is reg
stered to-day he cannot vote at the primary and has by his
indifference to his duty contributed to the continuance of graft and
bad government. , - y-v ;
If passing incidents do not admonish the people of their duty
they are deaf to admonition. The use of public authority as a per
sonal perquisite is regarded as a proper method of administration
in this city. Thus we have seen the President of the Board of
Works using his official power against a personal enemy, and de
claring that he "would be a fool" not to use it in that way. Now, we
see the same Board of Works trying to defeat a street cleaning
contract made by the Supervisors, in order to . give \u25a0 the job to a
favorite of the board at an increased cost to the taxpayersof more
than $20,000.
â¢'The Board of Works has used all the arts of chicane and.ras
calry in this attempt. It has grossly misrepresented the equipment
of the new contractor and his capacity to do the work, and its
agents have placed every possible obstruction in his way. His con
tract being for the removal of street sweepings after the employes
of the Board of Works have swept them into piles or put them in
the rubbish cans, he had hardly begun the work before the board
attacked him.
The Supervisors sought to have the city kept clean at the least
cost consistent with the efficiency of the work. The Board of
Works sought to make the process as costly as possible, the only
consideration with it being that the contract should go to its favor
ite, and the money of the taxpayers be spent for the benefit of the.
all grasping graft. To this end the Board of Works put every ob
stacle in the new contractor's way and at the end of his first week
reported that six hundred loads of sweepings remained, piled, and
not hauled. A committee of the Supervisors accompanied by ex
perts immediately made a survey of the city, and found that in
stead of six hundred, only thirty "loads remained unhauled, and that
this was due to the annoyance and obstacles imposed by the Board
of Works, and not to lack of equipment or incapacity of the con-
Now the inference is obvious, that the streets can be cleaned
for more than $20,000 less than the Board of Works wishes to spend
for that purpose. It is not a large sum in a budget of many mil
lions, but the official greed and dishonesty that will take $20,000
out of the people for nothing will take the whole budget if it have
the power and opportunity. Is there any moral or indeed legal dif
ference between Smith, the City Treasurer, taking $65,000 out of
the Treasury, giving the taxpayers no return, and the Board of
Works taking $20,000 out and giving no return? The $65,000 grab
is called stealing because it was direct, and the thief is now serving
time for it. Is the offense made any better by the indirection,
through the form of a contract which exacts $20,000 more than the
servfce is worth?
The Supervisors desire to save that sum. The Board of Works
wants to waste it. When. an item like that comes to the surface, how
much is there of the same kind that does not see the light? This is,
one of a myriad of symptoms of the low morality of the city gov
ernment. What greater misfortune can occur than the indorsement
of such conditions through the neglect of citizens to register and
VOte? '::-â¢\u25a0
The syndicate writers who work on a political job for hire and
work backward upon city public opinion through the columns of
the suburban press are in full cry at the heels of every man who
desires better conditions in San Francisco. These writers see only
the loftiest virtues in stuffing ballot boxes to keep the gang in
power. They express frankly the opinion that a majority of {he
people like the graft and waste, vice and indecency which are the
existing conditions, and will say so at the polls. <We deny that this
is so. .The people who like theft and waste of the money of the
taxpayers, effected by corrupting the Hot. box and cheating the
jail, are limited to the minority which in some way benefits from
these public offenses. %he citizens who do not want these things,
who favor good and decent government, are in the majority, and
can be beaten only by dividing their strength. Let them all register
to-day and begin at the primary the habit of standing together, and
they put the grafting minority under foot. , ; ';?
The need of the greatest vigilance is shown by the fact that the
Republican League has sent out 81,000 letters to voters on the
present register, and of these 7500 have been returned indorsed
"Not living there." Every legal voter must register and then see
that the register is purged of fraud. . ,
STREET RAILWAY FARES.
x^N OMPARISONS made with street railway systems in foreign
I countries in order to enable us to form a right judgment* of
our own, should be more complete than they usually are, if
we are to come to correct conclusions. The public is apt to be mis
led-into thinking that three-cent fares of European cities show that
we are at a great disadvantage because we pay five cents.. The con
clusion is superficial. Chicago is finding that out. She brought an
expert in railway management from Glasgow to give her his per
sonal teaching after he had carefully looked over the American sit
uation and compared it with the Scottish. He found the problem
so complicated that he could not compare directly any two terms of
it;vTwo whole fields of widely differing facts had to be- looked
over comprehensively to arrive at a sane decision. What was good
for Glasgow would be folly for Chicago. - O.* [ r J/.
; The general conclusions of the Glasgow expert serve as an il
lustration for guidance in considering the one item of relative price
of street car travel. Because British cities only pay two and three
cent fares, while we are paying five, we must not jump to the con
clusion that they are getting more for their money than we are.
Nor should we inconsiderately believe that the cheap policy in this
matter is the best policy. In progressive America we can willingly
afford. to pay more if we get adequate returns for the outlay. We
Â«re getting it, and that not merely in. the immediate personal service,
but in the larger way of civic. betterment and advancement of civili
sation. - Â«- â¢ * . . .
By our system of transfers we go five times as far for five cents
as. the Britisheri goes for three. Our suburban extensions and oiir
railway consolidations make this desirable and possible. Thus cheap
rapid transit works well in two ways. It draws people closer to
gether for business and industrial developments, and it enables them
to spread farther apart for health, pleasure, esthetic considerations
and spacious and commodious home building. Let this good work
go on, and let us for the present be willing to pay our five cents' for
it. At least this until it can be clearly proved that the expense is
not inordinate to the return in personal service and in the broad
betterments that sociologists so much desire involving the problem
of swjft, close communication, without ugly and unsanitary over
crowding. . :\u25a0,\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0 .i â¢:. -

ABOUT THIS TIME PREPARE FOR PICNICS
DR. BRAWN ON EDUCATION
DR. ERASMUS BRAWN, the presi
dent of Hale University and one
of the most distinguished edu
cators on this side of the -Atlantic,
sailed for Europe yesterday on the Blue
,Star liner Dyspeptic. He is off on his
regular, annual' vacation, and will go
direct from' England to Rotterdam,
where he will begin an automobile trip
through the famous German bierstube
country. Mrs. Brawn and the children
remain at home, and will spend "the
summer in the family camp on' Lake
Hoppywottomy in central Maine..
Though ostensibly this trip of "Dr.
Brawn's is a vacation, he has' a) vast
amount of work to do, as he is to'con
duct some important researches In
steinological lines, and he' may be de
tained until late in- the fall, though he
will make every effort to return in time
for .the Hale-Pinchton game in ..No
vember. \u25a0 \u25a0 ./ \u25a0 ,y * \u25a0 \u25a0
The famous editor was found on the
Blue. Star pier just before the vessel
sailed, and as he stood among his \u25a0 pilo
of luggage, directing the disposition of
it, he puffed at a cigarette and talked
interestingly of educational matters.
There is no cant about Dr. Brawn.". He
is always clear, concise and straight
forward, -and when he laughed when
his attention was directed to a .para
graph in the morning" paper announ
cing a new outbreak among the "West
ern educators, who aver that ' college
students should study, his hearers felt
that it came â¢ direct from bis heart.
SO LITTI.B TIME FOR STUDY.
"I have already replied to these ante
diluvians," the famous educator said
smilingly as he' seated himself upon 'a
case of guns. "You remember, to sum
up my argument, I stated that the col
lege student simply did. not have time
to study, when the football man hsfs
to begin training in August and. ,the
oarsman and the baseball player on
Christmas. -These sports fill the 'year
to repletion, and we cannot expect the
young. men" to settle down' to books. I
believe I .made that" statement last
November, when -the-, controversy be
gan, and. I wish to point out now that
the reports from the various colleges
over the country of > the year's work
support my contention. For example,
I Interview you for a moment.' *' Who
pitched on { the'; Halo -nine in the three
games with Pinch ton 7' _ . ;
' "O'Rafterty," replied the puzzled .â¢ re
porter. ; "Everybody, knows that." ',
"Exactly!" cried the doctor with ex-:
ultation. "Now, who .graduated from
Hale with the highest" honors " ' 'this
year?"'- ' V . ;; w '*â¢ â \ ;,"" -Â£
"Give It up/ said the reporter. "It
has never been printed." 7^
The famous educator slapped I his sides
with delight "I could not tell you my
self," lie said. "I. should have to Inquire
of the university secretary. \u25a0 I thinks he
records such things.'; As a matter of fact,
it is of no interest to anybody. ;â¢, O'Raf
ferty, by the way, has an excellent- posi
tion for .the summer as. a . gripman" on a
Boston trolley car, and promises to \u25a0 re
turn to us in the . fall harder than ever,
to play / half \u25a0\u0084 back on ;. our ; eleven... \,We
have great hppes of the young man." *
. Dr.: Brawnf tossed aside . his cigarette
and lighted a: handsome briar. ; pipe, a
parting gift, 'he j explained, ' from some of
his friends in the Hale faculty. \u25a0 j

fall will be larger by 500 than-'ever before,
and J. venture to; predict that at Pinchton
a corresponding loss will be shown. Let
me call attention to- the advance of edu
cation all ' over, the {country. Progreis is
no longer confined to the large universi
ties, .but the .smaller colleges are playing
better in every department. It used- to
be that Hale and Pinchton could hardly
get practice out of the average college
eleven, but last fall both of them had
several narrow squeaks and might
easily have gone down: to ignominious
defeat! before : the hosts of little fresh
water institutions^ iHow 'do â¢ I account
for .-It? ;*o the sporting pages of

affairs has been aroused in the iron foun

and : many 'of our most famous : students
coming from those muscle-making schools.
Hale' and Pinchton' and Hervard^eannot
give " places ; to them all, j and : many of
them of necessity .must 'oursue their, ed
ucation in the second rate colleges." '
"V\ r ouldit not be agreat thing for edu-.

fully for some moments.'

TRUTHFUL.GIBSON SENDS
HURRY-UP CALL
Detective Wires That Wit
nesses Against Collins Must
â¢ Start for North at Once
PROCEEDINGS ON TO-DAY
B.vington Anxiously Awaits
News of Defense on Which
Fugitive Stakes Liberty
Word was received by District Attorney
Bylngton last night that the actual wit
npsses of the alleged perjury of George
D. Collins must be started north on the
first train, if the State of California
hoped to bring ba/:k the accused bigam
ist into its jurisdiction. A continuance of
the long delay In sending them would
probably result in a victory for Collins,
it was made evident by. the dispatch.
The telegram was signed by Detective
Thomas Gibson, who Is on the coll of
British Columbia with the extradition
papers requesting the delivery of the per
son of the fugitive to him. and he stated
lv his message that the witnesses must
be sent at once and with them the orig
inal copy of the answer filed by Collins,
the document on which the charge of
perjury is based. The telegram Is as fol
lows:
VCTORIA. B. a, JbJf 18. 1805.
3. V. rMr.&n. Chief of Police. Emu Frmncleoo:
Notify Bylngton and Lawlor that they will
have to send thÂ« notary, A. J. Henry, and
Thomas E. Curran: aiso originals of complaint,
*r.swÂ»r and Collins' affidavit. They should
leavÂ» lntne&tately *n4 you should wire rae iva
tar4Lately that they hare left, so we can get
an adjournment pending their arrival.
GIDSOX FEARS DEFEAT.
From this message it eeems that Gib
eon fears that unless he receives word
that the witnesses are actually on the
road to Canada, the /court thÂ«re win not
?rant the continuance and Collins will be
set free. The preliminary hearing will
take place to-morrow morning and the
.detective wants to ask for an adjourn
ment until next Monday, when all the
witnesses can be ore Sent.
It is unlikely, however, that be will be
able to tell the Northern Judge that these
witnesses have started, for they will not
leave San Francisco until to-night, at the
earliest. District Attorney Bylngton
feels confident that with the proofs that
Gibson has at his command the Cana
dian court will grant the request for
the delay. It is an odd change of cir
cumstances that now presents itself. In
San Francisco It was Collins who was al.l
the time asking for a continuance and
who delayed the trial, but In Canada the
State Is me prpcrastlnator.
KEWMAX READY TO GO.
Mr. Bylngton will send R. V. Whiting,
an assistant in the District Attorney's
< ffiee and an expert on the law of per
jury, to represent California in the pre
liminary hearing In Victoria. Two wit
nesses who will make the trip are Justice
pf the Peace A. J. Henry and Attorney
Thomas E. Curran, the former to -swear
to the answer of Collins and the latter
a.i actual witness of the marriage with
Charlotta Eugenia Newman Collins. It
Ip likely that William E. Newman, brother
of this first wife, will go along to testify
to the marriage of Collins and his sister.
Mr. Bytngton told the fireman to hold
himself In readiness to depart at a mo
ment's notice; and yesterday afternoon
!:e was closeted with him for fifteen min
utes.
No charge of embezzlement has been
made against Collins by the Grand Jury
for the alleged taking of money from one
of his clients, Mrs. Anna J. Ward of Ala
meda. Collins undoubtedly took the
money, but no fiemanfl has ever been
made upon him for it, and even Mrs.
Ward herself is not certain that he "will
not eend her the test of the cash as soon
he is through with his own trouble. It
Is unlikely that she will press the charge,
although ehe will talk the matter over
with Byington to-day at the tetter's re
quest.

A Poor Cook makes

DEMAND that it be bbiled full 15 minutes AFTER ACTUAL
BOILING BEGINS (not only 15 minutes after the pot is put on
the Â«tove). A curious- chemical change takes place between 12 and
15 minutes a.fter Postum begins to boil. This change releases the food
elements and produces a crisp, snappy coffee taste so fetching that the
makers have been. many times accused of mixing coffee in. But that is
false. The full analysis of Postum made by the best American* authorities
shows that it is made only of the selected parts of cereal grains treated by
complex methods in the factory.

your Postum made right, and that is easy. Full and simple directions

Remember also that when you leave off coffee you stop the drugging
of stomach and nerve centers -and give Nature :"a' chance to heal your ails.
In this work Postum is a most^-powerful aid, for you not only have your .
hot morning beverage, but take a liquid food' containing the very ele :
ments Nature must have from .which- to rebuild. the gray matter in nerve
centers and brains that have been "broken down by coffee.

Small matter whar form of stomach, heart,; kidney or nervous disease
you may have, for the probabilities are that your troubles '.have originated

MOTIONS FOR GRAVEL
Big Deal t in Feather and
Bear River Claims Is
Near to Consummation
Mining men \ about the Palace Hotel
were busily discussing yesterday a j re
port to the effect that the deal pending
f or> several .; months' between/the j London
Venture Corporation and '- the owners of
several valuable dredger properties on
the* Feather River for tne sale of the
latter had finally been effected in Lon
don: â¢*A private dispatch from the"~East,
received by,* a well-known mining man,
who is staying at the Palace;. stated that
the London Venture" : Corporation -had
agreed to take over the s properties and
that its representatives ' would, soon"" be
here to arra rige a , formal transfer.
The properties involved are the Boston
and California and the Boston - and Oro
ville companies, the Oroville Gold Dredg
ing and Exploration Company and : the
Bear River Company. . The latter is sit
uated on the Bear River. The price
agreed upon is said to be $3,000,000. Among
the owners of these" properties rare-Mil
lionaires Evans and Clark of Boston and
William P. Hammon and" A, F. Jones of
Oroville, the - estate of the late Colonel
J. E. Doollttle, Fred W. Bradley, W. SH.
Crocker, the Guggenhelms, John Hays
Hammond and several others, who are
prominently identified with the dredging
enterprises along the rlversf in Northern
California. â¢ .
Several months ago ; representatives of
a "number of big mining concerns of the
East and London came to" this city for
the purpose of effecting a consolidation
of the larger properties along the Feather
River, with \ a^vlew of bonding and sell
ing them. Among the intended purchas
ers were . the London Venture Corpora
tion; which: was represented ' here by
Ernest A. Wiltsee. and the United States
Smelting and Refining Company. It was
finally determined that the consolidation
of all the big properties Into one concern
would be too big a deal to turn so the
attention of. the Eastern representatives
was directed to a consolidation of only
a few of the mining companies. ,-'.'\u25a0
Eventually, the London Venture Cor
poration secured an option on the com
panies named above and Us representa
tives returned to London' to carry .out
the plans for the big/deal. John Hays
Hammond recommended the purchase of
the properties and William P. Hammon
of Oroville examined and reported upon
them. There are eight dredgers already
at work on these properties and orders
for six more have already been placed.
According to the report received yester
day from the East the stock of the com
pany, which has been incorporated in
London to take over the properties, has
already been fully subscribed.

other nations of the earth, and
"Whereas, A policy of protection, de
signed to protect domestic production

HIGHEST PRAISE
-- . \u25a0. .. .-\u25a0 . 'â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0
Ti voli y Again Takes Laurels
From tlie Bostbnians in
; the Production of Opera
RIVALS "BOBIN HOOD"
Cast Is VeryjStrohg/ Includ
ing Arthur Cunningham,
Miss Condon and Others
If Mr. Oscar Well .were In town I would
ask him to say "bully", for me^lt is his
word, but the only one that, fits "Rob
Roy." As last year the , Hyoll stole lau
rels from the Bostonians In their "Robin
Hood ,", they challenge them this - with
' "Rob Roy." It is * not easy to imagine
a better than the "stunning performance
that the Tlvoli presented last night.".' Nor
are cojpÂ»lc operas; better, than^'Rob Roy",
growing on every/bush, : , Most nearly the'
rival. of the famou^'RobiniHopd'.* Is this
among the De.Kbven '.operas. Musically
it would make I seventeen'; of "The - Red
Feather,"' and Mr.-Smith Is simply star
ful in ; the libretto. : . .
The age -of. the opera is not given, but
the Inherent, evidence 'is. to.its- precedence
of "Robin Hood." Sparkling,' good Scots
in colorâ not by any , means/ all wheezed
through the bagpipesâ and admirably well
made, it has yet not quite the lyric sure
ty,. the cleaji t concise v melodic ~ cut and
build of "RoiJin Hood." 4 But it U even
more ambitious in the ensembles, even
grand-opera tically important,* and, withal,
with a quick . and poignant melodic flow,
throughout. ,1 misdoot me .' much, . as
Teddy Webb would say, but that the tar
tan of "Rob \u25a0 Roy" "would - prove a dan
gerous rival to the Lincoln . green were
both equally well known. Once before
only the opera has been given here,- eev-.
eral years ago by- the BostonianÃ.i. ... Â£Â£?*
The Tivoli "produces," not \u25a0â¢:. merely'
"presents" the opera. ; The cast Is an all
star one, beginning with Max Freeman,
whose adroit hand is felt in every corner
of the production. , Kate- 1 Condon .reap
pears as Flora Macdonala; Anna Llchtef
comes back as Janet and Arthur Cun
ningham re|urns ,as . Roy Roy. Then
there is a flttle matter of Barron Ber
thald, who sang, the role of Prince
Charlie 350 times in New York, and the
"debuting" of Frank R. Hayes, who
springs at once from the glories of , "The
King of the Opium Ring" to comic "opera.
One cannot listen to Mr. Hayes and
doubt the genuineness of the debut. He
will never die singing. But this does
not at all matter. His ',legs are his
fortuneâ and there's, money tn them. If
I mistake not there Is an Eddia Foy and
an Alf Whelan combination in Mr. Hayes
and he is coming. :';-- â¢.- \u25a0.-\u25a0-= ;\u25a0â¢â¢".â¢
Which is not to forget Teddy Webb.
The more Mr. Webb has to do the more
he does. As the Mayor, of Perth, in a
turn-coat part that may have been
filched from "The Black Hussar," and
with a reversible dialect that keeps him
at his busiest, Teddy does his best work
since the singing master In | "The Sere
nade." i One of the hits of- the piece is
his horhpipeing, and throughout he is
capital. He has most- of the .line fat;
his "Let every one sit on .the"Jthistle >>;â; â
in scorn of the Scotâ not being the worat.>
JCilts are worn of course. i :-:\u25a0.;
Miss Condon , comes back with an evi
dent year- of growth' behind her. ; She is
freer* in' expression, surer of herself, and
vocally richer.' Her Flora Macdonald is
a handsome picture, , acted â¢ with stately
grace, anu Miss i Condon has some, charm-,
ing songs... ; Miss Llchter's light but
pretty voice, /did 'good "service ;; In
the rolÂ« of Janet, '. and she . is j merry^! and
attractive in the- pjfrt. .2 Grace \ Palotta's
English Captain is also brightly handled.
Rob Roy is handsomely undertaken by
Arthur Cunningham, both from'.tne yocal
and acting, side. He sings no .better than
when he went away, but Mr.'^Cunning
ham sings always well,' 'and he wears the
kilts; bravely. Barron Berthald is the
Prince Charlie and gallantly equal to the
role. He has not so much to do as one
would like. Schuster and Fogarty fill in
excellently and~ the . chorus In kilts and
phiiabegs is taking as ever. ; >.
It isa "production," and every-minute
of It .worth while.

BÂ£eclal Dispatch to The CaJL
PORTLAND. July 18.â That the striped
suited jnen from Tigertown were shut
out to-day wes due to the exceptionally
brilliant pitching of Essick, who at all
times In the game had the visitors under
full control and was given fine support
by his mates. Portland earned one of
Its runs, but the other two were gifts
through the Tigers' errors.
"Slats" Davis gave an exhibition of
discipline on the field when he chased
Mike Fisher and Charley Graham off the
field for butting in and questioning one
of his decisions. In addition both men
were assessed a five spot, much to the
delight of the Portland fans.
The only earned run of the game came
ta the first round, when Jakey Atz fell
on Thomas for a single and ran all the
way home on Houeehoider's three-cushion
drive. After that Thomas pitched shut
out ball, but mispiays gave the Giants
two more runs. Score:

. The welter-weight championship of the
world will be decided to-night at Colma,
when George Peterson, champion of Cali
fornia! and England,' will clash with
Buddy Ryan, . holder of tha'American
title. The flght Is scheduled to go twen
ty-flve rounds, and. so far tha Chicago
boxer, rules a favorlta.at odds of 10 to 7
over the Calif ornlan.
Much interest has been manifested In
the conflict and from the number of tick
ets sold, It is certain a big house will
make the trip Into San Mateo County to
see the mix-up. Cars will run at short
Intervals from Fifth and Market streets,
and after the tight will be waiting to
whirl the sports back to this city In good
season.
The fight promises to be onÂ© of the true
rough-house variety while It lasts, as
both men are used to wading In and mix
ing things when the gong sounds. Peter
son has several inches to his advantage
in reach and height, but to offset this his
opponent is a champion who has weath
ered the storm of many a hard battle
with the best men in the business.
Should Peterson win he will be one of
the most talked-of scrappers In America
to-morrow. A few months ago he was
practically unknown. He gained a little
prestige by hammering Frank May field
around the ring in a preliminary fight a
few months ago, but did not Jump Into
prominence till he made a chopping block
out of Jack Clancy, the British cham
pion.
Ryan has never appeared before a local
crowd, though many of the sports have
been yearning to see him put up his mitts
against some of the Natives. For this
reason It Is expected that a representa
tive assemblage will be at the ] ringside
when the time arrives for the mill to
start* If Ryan is beaten he will not nave
much of a chance to shine here again,
but should he win there will be many
matches In store 'for him In the near fu
ture.
Beth boxers finished up their training
work yesterday and are now waiting. for
the bell to sound. The rivals are In fine
shape and fit to go the full limit, though
it is almost a certainty the bout will end
by the knockout route long before the
time limit is up. The men will weigh
in at Harry -Corbett's at 145 pounds at 6
o'clock this evening.
Billy Roche, the official referee of the
Golden State Athletic Cluo, will be. the
third man in the ring. Joe Thomas and
George Brown are carded to go In the,
preliminary, and a fast mill Is expected,
as both boys are fighters who fight. It
will be Thomas' webut as a professional.
UHIXT'S TEAM VICTORIOUS.
Orphenm Stars Are Dovrned on Golden
Gate Park Diamond.
Jimmy Brit t's baseball team took a
fall out of the Orpheum bunch yester
day afternoon at Golden Gate Park by
a score of 21 to 13. The game was not
quite up to the standard of what Is
generally seen In the National League,
but there was many a hot grounder
stopped and many a howl at the de
cisions of Nat Goodwin and "Pop"
Rice. X
James Edward graced the right gar
den, while brother Willie, Tlv Krelllng,
Sam Berger,- Frank Rafael and other
leading lights were scattered promis
cuously around the diamond. The Or
pheum stars were outclassed when the
Brlttites commenced to get into the go
ing and the result never was in doubt
for a moment.
' Nat Goodwin showed he is â¢ a great
umpire, but Rice had his troubles when
he rendered a close decision against
the Britts. The entire team waded into
"Pop" and after downing him, gave
him one minute to reverse his ruling.
He was glad of such an easy chance to
escape the vengeance of the pugs and
promised never to get rash again.
The training work of Brltt and Sul
livan is about ended. The rival light
weights will do a bit of light work to
day and then they are due to throw
aside their training clothes and wait
for the all important -moment., when
they face each other In '"Woodward's
Pavilion on Friday night. Both are fit
and ready to go the route.
There has been little or no betting
on the outcome - of . the \u25a0 battle so far,
though It -is .expected ithe, bettors Twill
begin to get busy to-morrow. '. All the
wise ones admit Britt will be a 10 to
7 or .6 choice over the "Washington lad.
The local sports do not like to take
any chances on Sullivan, as they have
never seen him in action. His work at
the training quarters, however, has
convinced many of "the wise ones that
he is there and capable. of putting up a
fast --fight. V - - x
The sale % of seats "opened up yester
day at Harry Corbett's and from pres
ent .indications a big house will turn
cut on' Friday night. Parson Davtes
writes r from New: York that Sullivan
has an awful . good chance to win, as
he is a dangerous puncher and a boy
who can take a great amount of pun
ishment. :,;"

NEW HAVEN. Conn., Jul7 18.âA
hearing was held in the ProbatÂ© Court
to-day on the acceptance of the account
of William J. Bryan as exceutor of the
estate of the late Philo S. Bennett. M.
H. Wickwire, counsel for Mrs. Delia
Bigelow and George W. Cable, legatees,
filed a statement of his formal objec
tions to certain items in the account.
These items Include the transfer tax
of $5500 and charges made by attor
neys. It was claimed that had Bryan
settled the estate promptly without re
sorting to litigation the taxation would
not have been so large. On the other
hand, Bryan's counsel declared that thÂ©
estate was liable to a 10 per cent pen
alty, but he got that remitted, so that
the estate may consider itself that
much in.
Judge Cleveland reserved his deci

Before Albany Legislature

Former Congressman Ex
plains His Connection With
Postoftiee Appointments
ALBANY, N. V., July 18â Former Con
gressman "Warren B. Hooker was a vol
untary witness to-flay at his trial before
the joint Legislature on charges grow
ing out of the postal Investigation.; Jus
tice Hooicer, whose career In Congress
ceased in 1898, said that it was the cus
tom in many districts for retiring Con
gressmen to have postofflce patronage.
He - spoke feelingly of the vast ! number
of reauests;that come. to a Congressman.
Many of his -constituents, said he, regard
him as an errand boy between them and
the departments. In the charges against
Justice Hooker, It is alleged that Frank
P. Ballof Dunkirk was given a position
in theFredonla postofflce at the Bollclta
tion:of Hooker. That Ball never per
formed any service \ and that his salary
was applied to liquidating notes given by
Bail and Indorsed by Justice Hooker's
wife. The witness asserted that neither
he nor his â¢ wife loaned a dollar directly
to Ball. Mrs. Hooker went onhis. notes
only 89 an accommodation lndorser.
fact that Ball was not doing any
work in the Fredonla postofflce, the wit
ness averred, was never Â¥ brought to his
notice, nor did he ever h^ve any conver
sation with- Ball or arrangement by
which Ball was to do no work and was
to apply the salary toward the payment
of the notes.
Of his neohew, Maurice Hooker, ho
said he never Knew that young Hooker,
who had a position as laborer In the Fre
donta postofflce, was not actually doing
the work. â¢ " ~
"I.' never, paid a dollar." said the wit
ness/ "of - the money which Postmaster
Taylor of Fredonla restored to 'the Gov
ernment for Ball's and Hooker's sal
aries."

OP A HEAVY DEFICIT
Report of International Mer
cantile Marine Company
Shows Unprofitable Year.
NEW YORK, July . 18.â A deficit of
$1,142,0-38 for the year ended December 31
last, as compared with a surplus- of $1.
797,797 for the preceding year. Is shown
In the statement given, out by the.lnter
national Mercantile Marine Company in
Hoboken to-day. President. Bruce Ismay
ascribes the poor showing made by the
company largely to the continued. depres
sion in freight rates on the North Atlan-.
tic during the latter part of 1904.Z: While
passenger traffic has been large, the com-,
pany's ships carrying to and from all
European and. American ports 2&51 per
cent of the whole earnings were seriously
affected by the all-around cut* in passen
ger rates. \ ' '
: President Ismay makes this Indirect
reference to the decline In the company's
securities: . -V. : * .
"Inasmuch as the securities of your
company are so largely held abroad as
well . A3 In America the International
character which it consequently bears
should be an important factor, in bring
ing about a better Understanding among
the great' steamship companies^ engaged
in the North Atlantic trade." , ' ,
He concludes with the statement that
the outlook for the year 1905 is more
favorable.

GENERAL SUMMARY.
Oar weather prevailed throughout the State
dur.r.g thÂ« week, with frequent light foe* in
the coast districts and a light local shower in
the vicinity of Ban Diego. The axtreme heat
cf the preceding week was followed by much
lower temperature in ill sections, continuing
tip to the preÂ«Â»nt. (Note â The maximum tem
peratur* at Baa Dlero last weÂ«k was incor
rectly reported aa 88 degrees! instead of 74 de
grees.)
Gr&la harvesting and thrashing and hay bal
ing ai* progressing rapidly. Grain U far be
low early estimates In the Sacramento and
Ban Joaqula valleys, but therÂ».ls & fair crc-p
In C-.e co&et filaÂ»trlct.Â» and an exoellent crop in
(southern California. Hay has yielded the best
crop for several years. Sugar t*ets are yield-
Ing well and axe of excellent quality. Hops
end beana are in go*d condition and making
rapid growth. The heat of last week caused
but tricing- damage to beans and sugar beets.
1 Com, potatoes aad vegetables arÂ» doing well.
Feed is still plefitlful and stock are In good
condition.
Grapes aafl fieclfluous fruits were cor.Bld
Â«rab!y Injured by the heat of the preceding
week, but the cool weather following has had
a very beneficial effect and the loss will not
be as great as anticipated. Fruit harvesting
is progressing and heavy shipments are being
ly-.ajie Grapes are rapidly maturing and rive
W -'ailcitless of * large yield. Citrus fruits.
Â» nuts aad olives axe la excellent condition in
moet sections.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY. â Clear weather
and much lower temperature followed the hot
\u25a0wave of the preceding week, and conditions
\u25a0were generally favorable for all crops. Har
vesting, thrashing and hay baling continue.
Grain la moÂ«t sections Is a much llrhter crop
x.haa expected, and la some places the yield is
vk> light to pay for hai-verting. Grasshoppers
and rust caused immeasÂ© daaaage to grain in
rr.ar.y sections. The hay crop Is heavy aad of
excellent quality. Hops at "Wheatland are
rr.akir.g satisfactory progress and give Indica
tions of a good crop. The recent hot weather
caused a rapid ripening of deciduous fruits
ar.d also considerable damage to prunes, plums
end grapes. The cool weather of the past
â¢neck has been very beneficial, however, and
the loss will probably be lees than anticipated.
There is a large crop of plums and the. quality
Is gtDod. Peaches are light la some sections.
Almonds will yield nearly an average crop.
Citrus fruits are In good condition.
' COAST AND BAT 6ECTTON3.â CooI, clear
weather ft et ailed Curing the week and It was
very beneficial to all crops. The extreme heat
' of the preceding week caused <k>nsl<3erable in-
Jury to deciduous fruits, grapes aad berries,
tut the Ices will not bÂ« as heavy as antici
pated, owing to the more favorable conditions
following Forest and field fires caused rreat
<3arr.aj?e in AlameÂ«a, Sonoma and Santa C3ara
counties. Grain harvesting and thrashing are
j-.rorrrsslT-ig and a fair crop is being gathered.
ThÂ» Kffslan fly and grasshoppers caused much
* <amapp to rrain and the crop will be lighter
than expected. Hay baling continues: the crop
Ss heavy and the quality excellent. Hops are
rrakir.g-" rapid growth. Feed Is still plentiful
\u25a0ad rattle we doing well. Fruit picking, dry-
Ing ard shipping are in progress. Grapes and
elmor.i!* jrtve premise Â»Â»f large crops. Walnuts

' a felr erer>. Cloverfiale oranges are in excel-
Ifr.t eociJ'.tion.
PAN JOAQUTN VALLEY". â Clear weather
rivalled during the past week, the first of
â¢whlrh vu very \u25a0warm and the latter moder
ately cool. Grain harvest is making rapid
r^gre**: the yield Is llrht. but the quality is 1
fair. Peaches are being shipped in large quan

that the trivial Cuctuatlcns In price were

Trading was very active during the session.
Miss Giles 1 report, given: out before the open-,
Ing. showed the condition of the. crop as 76.7
for the month of July, .compared with 77 in
the last report, whereas' the condition wa3
expected to show 73 or 74. The Galveston
News' report on Texas' condition and acreage
was considered very bullish. The weekly
weather and crop report, although showing
some improvement In the central and Western
belt, is more mixed than expected, 'as Is indi
cated by the summary, ana the outlook con
tinues poor for want of cultivation. Grassy
fields are generally reported, and rains con
tinue. The report is construed as lees favor
able than expected. Reports of abandoned
fields continue. Damage Iby boll weevil in

Deciduous nnd Citrus Fruits.
The. general 'tone of ; the fruit market was
one or easiness, with handlers trying to urge
business by cutting prlcea of the -leading de
ciduous j descriptions. â¢ The market was badly
congested with small ' packages of Plums,
Prunes,. Peaches and Apricots, and. although
trade in those descriptions. was stimulated con
siderably by the reduced prices, the market
was far from being * cleaned up at the close.
Top quality lots of Bartlett Pears and â¢ Gra
vensteln Apples were firmly. . held "at "full
figures and were ' quite - steady, but | the lower
grades of Apples' and No. 3 Pears were ex
tremely dull and weak.. Figs were still la
limited supply and "continued to command good
prices. The canners were purchasing rather
freely of loose fruit, paying $10@15 per ton
for Apricots *$15 for Plums and $15Â®20 for
Yellow Freestone Peaches. Melons and
Grapes ruled weak, with .trade of a light char
acter. In the Berry line Loganberries and
Huckleberries were steady under light arrival*,
while all other kinds were in free supply and
easy. In the Citrus market Oranges and
Grape Fruit were firm, with stocks extremely
light., while Lemons continued to decline under
heavy arrivals and. a rather sluggish demand.

Illusion Fades Away When Waiter Seeks
To Collect for Refreshments Ordered,
George Trcde blew Into a Pacific street
dance hall with a brannlgan that would
crack a brick. That is to say, Mr. Trede
entered a Terpslchorean resort on the
thoroughfare named Pacific and. at the
time was "splflcated," which Is a polite
way of getting around the positive asser-
tion that he was intoxicated, inebriated,
or. in plain English, full of booze. Any
how he had a skate en, not an ordinary
ev^ry day skate that anybody can plcK
up on the road between the ofllce and
home, but a systematic, fully paid up
skate. He' wa3 justifiably proud -of that
s=kate. He planned it himself, sitting by
the ' smoky' fire of the sheep camps. He
promised himself a skate after the shear
ing and he certainly had it when he
hit that Pacific street shanty.
"Cut that waltz out," ordered the leader
of the orchestra. "Here come.? the real
thing. â¢ Play 'Hail to the Chiefâ strong
on the trombones."
George spotted the baby with the pink
klmonaâ ln other words, Cupid brought
a haymaker right on George's pericardia!
region when he threw his lamps on the
kid In rink.
-Were his, affections reciprocated? Well,
I wonder! She saw him first and her
orbs burned with a yearning that would
melt a collar in Iceland.
He (lopped down at the table with the
pink kid. It was curtains. Love at first
sight.
"Play, 'Believe Me if All Those Endear
ing Young Charms,*, " suggested the pro
prietor. "This certainly Is a live one."
"Did I hear you chirp, kldlets?" in
quired Mr. Trede playfully. '
"Beg â¢ pawdon," ' said the' pink vision,
perplexedly. â¢\u25a0:â¢ â¢ â¢" _.s \u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0;â¢\u25a0â¢'' â¢ - â¢\u25a0 .
'p, "What did you say?" asked Mr. Trede,
throwing plates full of mush into his
glances. ;
"I said beer," rerlied the lady, coming
back to earth with a thump that rattled
tho glasses. \
The waiter made Mercury look like a
boncyard ecuine with the gout. He
didn't run.- He just broke- a record for
fo'Ttcen feet.
George and It In pink absorbed. The
beer disappeared like a. bucket of water
In a sand dune, when Plnkness got Into
the' going.
. . "Kick -.in ; with ..a. dollar,".- said -the
waltec 7vi \u25a0 - '\u25a0 '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0":.. '"'y-- \u25a0â¢:â¢ ;--';:
"What!" Fhouted 'Trede. "A dollar.
Say. I was taken for John D. Rockefeller
once before and got sixty days for pass
'.nz tainted money. Cut it out, will you?
It's rough work.' Cross my heart and
hope to die if you find any Standard Oil
about me." '-:>>.'â¢' : ''-*-U-7. *
"Now don't holler, kid," pleaded the
vision in pink. "Kick In with the priest"
"I'm a eit'zen, ain't I?" thundered Mr.
Trede. "I'm- American cit'zen,' I am.
Ain't eit'zen got any rights?"
"Don't holler, kid," pleaded. her queen
lets In pink. - "Whatever you do, don't
holler." \u25a0 \u25a0'
But Mr. Trede was in excellent voice.'
He. read the Declaration \u25a0of Independ
ence, skipped to Patrick Henry's ad
dress on the Delaware, rung in a little
of Napoleon at the Pyramids, tore off
some of Washington crossing the Alps
and was just getting, lnto Daniel Web
ster on the Philippine question when
the crash came. All this time the lady
In pink was Interposing" the . plea,
"Don't holler.' kid."
Her last words as Mr. j Trede was
wafted through the fog:, propelled â¢by
v.'ell directed sole-leather, werei. "Don't
holler, kid." 1 .
As George sat suddenly and uncere
moniously upon the cold hard bitumen.
It In pink still wailed softly, "Don't
holler, kid. Whatsoever you* do, don't
holler." '
But Mr. Trede heeded not the siren's
command to be a clam. He did "holler."
He "hollered" so loud that the Coast
squad and the Chinatown squad flanked
Pacific street to suppress the riots.
"What's the charge?'' asked Judge
Conlan, when George was dragged be
fore him. â¢" . â¢;.*.' '\u25a0.\u25a0'.'_: .^ .\u25a0 i

The telephone In 'Chief â¢ Dlnan's .office
jangled noisily. Filled with" expectations
of v another Mafia murder, the Chief
seized the- receiver and 'shouted ."Hello!"
"Hello!" replied a rather mushy voice.
"Is thish Chief; Dinan?"
"Yes," gasped the Chief hurriedly.
"What is it? Murder or robbery?" â¢
"It's only (hie) me,' Chief. â¢ Got another
