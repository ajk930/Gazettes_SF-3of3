Almost the entire time at the Botkin
trial yesterday was taken up by Dis
trict- Attorney Byington's closing ar
gument for the prosecution and Judge
Carroll Cook's charge to the Jury. At
4:30 p. m. the case went to the Jury. Dis
trict Attorney *Byington. in his argu
ment, which he began as soon as court
opened, said In part: *v â¢
"I agree with Mr. Knight: we want
you gentlemen ~to try this case ac
cording to the law of the . State
and the evidence, of the witnesses. It
is not a question of Mr. Knight's per
sonality in this case. Even if George
A. Knight comes before you and says
he wants to meet" Dick Brown in the
hereafter and tell him he defended his
daughter, that has nothing to do with
case."
Mr. Byington/ next took up the at
tack of counsel for the .defense upon
the late Chief" of Police Lees and said:
Mr. Byington. next went on to review

VERACITY OF. WITNESSES.
The District Attorney next .took up
that, portion, of the closing argument
of the defense about the sleuths of the
Police Department- sending innocent
people to San Quentin. "That is ab
surd, and you kriow that it could not
be done without the help of .the Dis

He then went on to. tell the jury that
every one who ate the candy â¢Â¦ that

who.did, not showed ,no symptoms of
poisoning. . . "It has been * said by Mr.
McGowan,- that. -there '.was-' no autopsy

"That is, trueif the body is not em

Byington Charges Jury to Bring in a Verdict of Guilty
and Mete Out Extreme Penalty of Death.
WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN DECLARED GUILTY OF MURDER IN THE FIRST' DEGREE FOR HAVING CAUSED THE DEATH
OF MRS. JOHN P. DUNNING BY SENDING HER A BOX OF POISONED CANDY. MAN WHO SECURED HER CONVIC
TION AND SCENES IN COURTROOM. T - > , . Â¦ ,- .
KNIGHT SAYS THE VERDICT IS UNJUST
/ALWAYS accept Jhe verdict of ay jury. Of course zve shall appeal to the Supreme Court
for a nezu trial. I do not believe that the Supreme Court .will ever sustain such a verdict. No
one should -ever be convicted of murder on ; such^rjidence as ivasinp'oducedby]thc: prosecution
in this case. Look at their evidenceâ it's an' injustice. I have no doubt that Mrs. Botkin will
be granted a neiti trial. â -Statement by George A. Knight, Attornc\ for Mrs. Botkin.
The testimony if VDr. Stone and
Druggists Gray and Grey 'was com
mented upon, i also the statement mado
by the 'defendant Â¦ to Mrs. Ruoff that
something told her the relationship be
tween, her,. Mrs. Botkin, and "Jack"
Dunning; would be closer than ever.
Byington contended that there was
murder' in her heart at that time. ':-?<'.
: "I: believe her testimony that when
in>;Healdsburg at- the midnight" hour
the .-walls'; seemed to be closing. in upon
her and some one seemed . clutching . at
her throat.",, he said. â "She" has experi
enced that; feeling : many times since.
Mr. "1 Knight has said that Â¦ womanhood
shrinks from this' woman at* the tbar.
Thank . God that, the instincts ; of true
motherhood and womanhood and Â¦, de
cency, shrink ; from this , woman."
The District Attorney -brought out
The speaker here took up the attack
of the defense^ on the expert testimony.
He referred to" the Fair will contest and
the Craven will, and how Knight lauded
Kytka at that time. ,
The next point touched upon was Mrs.
BotkhVs statement to Mrs. Ruoff that
three anonymous letters had been sent
toÂ» Dover, Del., before that fact was
known to any one in this city. He said
that Miss Livernash was told the same
and read from Mrs. Botkin!^ testimony
to bear out his contention. "She told
Mrs. Ruoff that the letters were in a
scrawly hand," said Byington. "Mrs.
Botkin sticks out of every sentence in
the letters. She said in her cross-exam
ination that she saw two of the letters
in the newspapers. Those letters were
never published until after her arrest.
She knew it because she wrote them.
"Airs. Botkin has told you, that she
went down one flight of stairs .in, the
hotel on ; Sunday morning and tele
phoned to Dr. Terrill. The physician
says .he was at. an operation and did
not receive any 'phone message from
Mrs. Botkin until Sunday. July 31. be
tween the hours of 2 and 3 p. m. Why
would she want to He? It is an evi
dence of her guilt. She lied about the
anonymous letters and the fact that
Dr. Terrill visited her Sunday."
During this portion of Mr. Byington's
argument Mrs. Botkin showed that she
was uncomfortable.
Byington next reviewed the testimony
relative to the purchase of the candy,
and said it was not necessary to prove
positively that the purchaser was Mrs.
Botkin. "In size and appearance the
witnesses say the woman who made the
purchase resembled the . â¢ accused
woman, and there are not many persons
whose appearance, size and movements
of the body resemble Mrs. Botkin."
He pointed out the testimony of Mrs.
Price and Mrs. Smith relative to see
ing Mrs. Botkin with a package in her
hand on the Sunday she is alleged to
have purchased the chocolates. He'satf:
"She stayed in her room that night and
the next night. She was concocting this
diabolical scheme to kill Mrs. J. P. Dun
ning. At the midnight hour she was
manipulating the chocolates. She left
the Hotel Victoria on August 4, the day
the candy was mailed. She wanted to
set 'away from the ; scene of her crime
and put the package in the mail on her
way to St. Helena."'
31 URDER IX HER HEART.
the defense has shifted from one theory
to another,"
Byington next dwelt upon the symp
toms 1 of arsenical -poisoning, saying:
"The motive in this case points to one
person alone, and that is the defendant.
Knight has said that lump arsenic can
not be bought. It was in the candy,
and some one put it there."
PURCHASE OF CANDY.
Byington went over the testimony of
a number of witnesses, and then in
troduced the supposed sensation of the
prosecution. An array of awe-inspir
ing microscopes had lined the table of
the District Attorney all day, and he
offered to show the jury by. them that
the inks on the wrapper of the box of
candy and on the anonymous letters
were the same. McGowan objected,
and after some discussion Judge Cook
sustained the obiection. and the micro
scopes were taken away. Much time
was devoted to the exemplars of hand
writing In evidence.
The District Attorney closed -with a
strong appeal to the jury to return ~a
verdict of guilty. Judge Cook then read
a lengthy charge. In his instructions
he said the relationship between Mrs.
Botkfn and Dunning should not bÂ«
taken into consideration. He also.in
formed the Jury that the motive need
not be positively established.
. At -4:30 p. m. the Jury, retired, and
as no verdict had Â¦ been reached in an
hour the members were sent to supper.
At iloon a recess was taken until 2
o'clock and during the afternoon ses
sion Byington again took up the. cud
gels in behalf of the late I. W. Lees.
He said: "It belittles any attorney to
stand by the grave of the dead and
throw mud. It does not take a valiant
man to kick a dead lion, and that ia
what Lees was. Knight did not dare
to say anything about him at the for
mer trial."
MICROSCOPES RULED OUT.
"John P. Dunning might have satis
fied Mr. Knight and Mr. McGowan if
he had been false to the memory of hi3
wife and had said, *I will never go
back to California. I know she pois
oned my wife, but I will stay away
from California; I will not assist the
officers by, announcing the truth from
the witness stand.' He said. 'I will
make some atonement. It will not be
a pleasant task to face Mr. Knight
again, to be subjected to his Jeers an<i
jibes.' I honor him for doing what he
could."
"She did not want to go to the Phil
ippines, but to Cuba, so as to be near
Dunning," said the District Attorney.
"Something has been said about J. P.
Dunning. I am not here to palliate
what he has done. Mrs. Botkin has
said she dragged him from the gutter.
She did it by taking him to the race
track and back to her room, where she
filled him with whisky so that her son
had to put him to bed. ...
what he deemed a most important bit
of testimony. He called attention to
the fact that in the letter to Governor
Budd, Mrs. Botkin asked for a position
as nurse~ In the Philippines, whereas
Dewey had not yet entered Manila Bay
and there was no thought of sending
troops to the islands until some time
afterward.
"The defense may appeal the case to
the Supreme Court, but I am positive
the appeal will be fruitless. We have
proved beyond the shadow of a doubt
that she is the murderess of Mrs. John
P^ Dunning, and she will have to suffer
for her crime. The evidence we intro
duced wasstrong at every point and the
chain of circumstances so well connect
ed that the attorneys "for the defense
could not break it, try as they would.
The verdict is a just one and a triumph
for the people."
"I am well satisfied with the verdict
of the jury," said District Attorney
Byington, "and while I worked hard for
and expected a verdict of hanging, still,
under the existing circumstances, I am
of the opinion that ample justice has
been. done. It was a long, and tedious
ordeal and a great strain on the prose
cution, yet we proved our case clearly
and beyond a doubt, and I am confi
dent that Mrs. Cordelia Botkin will
spend the remainder of her life in prison
for the heinous crime of which she
stands- convicted.
At the end of her second trial Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin finds r-erself con
demned once more to imprisonment for
life for murdering Mrs. John P. Dun
ning in IS3S.
At 11:15 o'clock last night the jury
filed into court and announced its ver
dict to be guilty of murder in the first
degree, with imprisonment for life as
.the penelty. The defendant has thus
been condemned by twenty-four citi
zcr.5= of San Francisco within six years.
The stoical woman heard the verdict
without visible emotion, except quick
ened breathing, then lapsed into the
mood that has been hers for six years.
The crowd in the courtroom listened
with breathless interest. If any ex-
PÂ» cted a dramatic finale or the prostra
tk-a of the prisoner they were disap
pointed. Many eyes were upon the con
dtmned. but they beheld a picture of
silence, not a scene of noisy emotion.
In anticipation of the prisoner's col
lapse and of a demonstration by the
audience. Judge Code instructed the
sheriff and tiis deputies to take special
pains to preserve^ order. He admon
ished the crowd that any demonstra
li<. n would be regarded as contempt of
court.
Jiints and tendencies during the ar
pument of defendant's attorneys fore
shadowed a breakdown, but the ex
pected did not happen, and the morbid
ly furious women, who forsook their
l espective households during the prog
ress of the trial, probably \vent away
disappointed.
In the throng attendant upon the last
trfnes of the trial was John P. Dnn
ri'ng. He sought an inconspicuous
j'laee. but he was there to be in at the
finish, as it were, of his wife's murder
er and the woman who ome loved him.
Punning did not make his appearance
until the afternoon session and during
the latter portion of District Attor
ney Byington's masterly address. He
wore a sack suit of light brown and
was an interested spectator. He often
jrlancd in the direction of the orison
er. but owing 1 to the fact that her
back was turned she was oblivious of
hip presence.
DELAWARE WITNESSES NEAR.
All of the Delaware witnesses were
in or near the courtroom at the ren
dering at the verdict. They made no
comment* but appeared satisfied that
Justice had been done.
â¢The jury retired at exactly half past
4 o'clock and it was an anxious hour
that Mrs. Botkin spent until the an
nouncement was made that the
jurors would be taken to supper and
an adjournment taken until 8 o'clock.
She sat at the table by the fide of her
Fister and was intensely interested in
Â« copy cf the New Testament. Page
after page of the Holy Writ she pe
rused until she was taken upstairs to
the City Prison to remain there dur
ing the absence of the jury.
At S o'clock the jury returned and
again began their deliberations. The
crowd in the courtroom had not per
ceptibly thinned out and new recruits
came in droves.
At a quarter past 9 Judge Cook was
informed that the jury desired some
further instructions and accordingly
the twelve men filed into the box. In
reply to a question of the court whether
a verdict had been reached Foreman
Hyman stated that they had not
reached one. He informed the court
that Boms of the jurors wanted the
testimony of Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Price
and Dr. Terrill and some of the ex
hibits in the cse. Judse Cook in
formed the jury that it was against
the statutes to take any transcript of
testimony into the room with them,
but if there was no objection it would
:;ot be improper to read it to them.
As both the prosecution and the de
fense were willing. Judge Cook called
for ih<Â» transcripts.
Foreman Hyman informed the court
th*>t the only portions of the testimony
of Mrs. Price and Mrs. Smith desired
wore those relative to Dr. Tcrrill and
July Cl. 1S?S. . Judge Cook granted the
rruuest. and read the sections desired
and also portions of the â¢ testimony
"riven by the physician. The note in
â¢hi> candy bon. "Love to yourself and
baJiy." and the acknowledged exem
plar ot Mm. B 'tkin's handwriting, tak
en from the Ruoff Jotter, "My love,
would that 1 could be with yvu," were
also asked for. and the jury retired
ncain to endeavor to arrive at a* ver
dict. '
JURORS TAKE TIME.
An hour dragged by and still no
agreement. Every one was becoming
cnxious. but Mrs. Butkin gave no sign
of nervous strain. At half past ten
Judge Cook requested the jurors to
advise him whether they desired to be
locked un for the night. The request
came hack that the jury be permitted
to deliberate until 11 o'clock. This an
' nouncement warranted hope of an
agreement. At last the bell in thÂ«Â»
tower tolled eleven times almost
mournfully,- .but still no word
from the Jury-room. Judge Cook had
After the jurors had been discharged
by Judge Cook they immediately re
turned to the- Palace Hotel to collect
their belongings, and socrn afterward
left for their homes. Most of the men
were reluctant to discuss the case and
few of them had anything to say con
cerning their deliberations. It appears
that during the six hours of delibera
tion twelve ballots were taken. The
first ballot resulted in a disagreement,
five men voting fc-r acquittal and seven
voting guilty. This ballot was taken
for the purpose of determining the
guilt or innocence of the accused and
with- no view as to the penalty.
Balloting continued and "many dis-;
cussions ensued. One of the jurors in
particular stood. firm in his belief that
Mrs. Botkin. should be given her lib
erty, and it was due to him that the
jury remained out as long as it did.
On " the eleventh ballot a unanimous
vote of guilty was returned. Then the
penalty was fixed. All of the men stood
firm for the minimum punishment,
there being- no - one. to \ speak in favor
"of the death penalty.
Juror Jacob. GoetJcn_was J . Questioned
regarding' the attempt to bribe" him,
but refused to make any statement.
He was met at the hotel by. two mem
bers of his family, and hurried away,

The impaneling of a jury for the sec
ond trial began In February and the
hearing of the case commenced ' on
March 14. From its beginning to its
finish the case was fraught with excit
ing incidents, the most sensational of
which was the declaration of Juror
Go<?tjen*that he had been approached
with an offer of money for a verdict in
the interest of the defendant. Since then
the last Jury has been kept constantly
together, , sleeping -.at night in apart
ments at the Palace Hotel, under the
watchful eye of a Deputy Sheriff.
Tk? two trials of Mrs. Botkin, in both
of which the verdicts were the same,
have cost the city of San Francisco
nearly $S0,O00, and have demanded in
one way or another the attention of the
judicial departments for five and a naif
years. Mrs. Dunning died in Delaware
on August_12, 1898, the day following
the death of her sister, Mrs..Deane.
who had also partaken of the poisoned
candy mailed to them by Mrs. Botkin.
Their deaths led to an investigation,
which was extended to this city and re
sulted In the indictment and arrest of
Mrs. Botkin early in November of the
same year. Her trial began before
Judge Cook, December 8, 1898. and a
verdict of murder in the Tlrst degree was
rendered by the' Jury on December 30.
Immediately afterward her attorneys
took an appeal to the State Supreme
Court and were granted a new trial on
the ground that the lower court had
erred in its instructions to. the jury on
the question of circumstantial evidence.
An appeal was also taken to the United
States Supreme Court on questions of
this Stale's jurisdiction in the case, but
the court ruled adversely to the appel

about made up his mind to place the
Jury iÂ»the custody of the Sheriff until
this morning, when suddenly the elec
tric call at the end of the courtroom
began to ring.
A verdict had been reached and the
jury filed slowly into the jury box.
Judge Cook made his announcement
about order and the clerk called the
roll.
The silence was intense and after
what seemed an interminably long
time Judge Cook said: "Gentlemen of
the jury, have you agreed upon a ver
dict?" "We have, your Honor," said
Foreman Hyman. at the same time
handing the fateful slip of paper to the
court
"The clerk will read the verdict,"
said Judge Cook, and then in a de
liberate tone the officer of the court
read: "We. the jury, find the defend
ant. Cordelia Boikin. guilty of murder
in the first degree and fix and assess
her "punishment therefor at imprison
ment in the Stats prison 'for life."
QUIET AT THE CLOSE.
During this dramatic scene Mrs.
Botkin was a study. Her head rested
on .her hands and she gazed straight
ahead, without so much as a notice
able tremor. ' - -
Judge Cook thanked the jury, and
fixed April 16 as the day of sentence.
After adjournment there was the first
scene of excitement. A babel of voices
made it almost impossible to hear. Dis
trict Attorney Byington and Judge
Ferral were the recipients of congratu
lations frcm their legal friends, and
George A. Muight and Senator Mc-
Gowan addressed words of cheer to
their client.
Not a tear fell from her eves and
there was no appearance of dejection
In her manner. So vigorous had been
District Attorney Byington's plea for
the death sentence that the prisoner
apparently felt relieved to know that
she still had life before her.
After the courtroom was cleared.
Mrs. Botkin was taken by the deputy
sheriffs to a surrey which was waiting
at the front of the Hall of Justice. A
struggling, neck-craning mob of cu
rious people crowded around the car
riage to get a glimpse of the murderess.
Her sister stooped to kiss the pris
oner, and the sister's slight frame was
racked with sobs. Mrs. Botkin, cast
ing a disdainful glance at the crowd,
with a sneer on her face, said to her
sister, "Don't you worry, don't you shed
a tear," and with another scornfu 1 .
glance at the motley assemblage told
the deputy Sheriff that she was ready
to go back to jail.

The troubles of the members of Lo
cal Xo. 19 of the Brotherhood of
Painters, Decorators and Paperhang
ers of America, which recently cul
minated in a row aiid the organiza
tion by the malcontents of a new
union, are to be aired in the courts.
Yesterday H. F. Sheehan, for himself
and on behalf of 950 other members
of the trade, filed two actions, one for
an injunction and $10,000 damages gsnd
the other for the recovery of the
property of the old union, against C.
E. Kurfsell, E. O. Brundage, H. L. An
drews and W. Hopps and 300 other
painters, members of the new union.
The injunction is to restrain the de
fendants from using the number 19 as
a designation for their organization,
the plaintiffs alleging that they have
the sole right to the number. . The
claim for damages Is based on the al
legation that by the use of the num
ber by the defendants the old organ
ization has been hurt In that a num
ber of artisans have Joined the new
body believing it to be the bona tide
union.
The property in question is very
valuable, according to the complaint.
It consists of the books of the old
union. $6000 in cash. 466 shares of
stock in the Organized Labor Publish
ing Company. 400 shares of stock in

At a meeting of the District Council

the following resolutions * were
adopted:
Whereas, As there has been for three months
disruption and ptrife within the ranks of
Painters' Union Local So. 19; and
Whereas. At the very besrinnlng of said
trouble it was charged by what 4s now known
an the *RurseIl-Brundajre faction that all said
trouble and disruption were caused at and
through the Instigation of P. H. McCarthy;
and
Â¦ Whereas, The eaid P. H. McCarthy caused
his minion* to iÂ»end distorted accounts of said
troubles and causes that led up to the same
to the general officers of our brotherhood: and
"Whereas. Our general officers did render . a
decision in favor of the McCarthy faction of
Local Union No. 19 wholly on these distorted
statements of McCarthy's minions and that,
too. without having ever heard .one word from
the true and majority side of the union; and
â¢ Whereas. The said P. H. McCarthy did.
while In Lafayette. Ind., assure the 'general
officers, of our brotherhood' that' he would
"make the climate of California unsuitable"
for those of our brotherhood who had refused
to abide by the unfair decision rendered on
wholly ex parte information as soon as they,
our general officers, g-ave him word to do so;
and
.Whereas. When finally, at our urgent re
quest, an official of our general executive
board did come out here to hold a fair (*)
and Impartial (?) InveKtlgatlon of the said
trouble that said general officer,* J. C. Skemp,
did place himself In direct communication with
P. II. McCarthy and his minions, absolutely
ignoring the majority side of the dispute- and
Whereas, The decision of J. C. Bkemp is
entirely at variance with the evidence sub
mitted, wholly arbitrary and unfair, and In
no wise founded on the principles of equity
and justice; and . "
. â¢ Whereaa, When the general â¢eeretary-treas
urer. M. P. Carrtck. and Third General Vice
President J. C. Skemp attended the meeting of
Local Union "So. 19 held at B'nai B'rith Hall
last Monday evening. April 4.' a proposition wa*
submitted that in itar.lf proves that the union
Â¦was desirous of ending the . controversy, even
'though they had to yield a great deal to do
to; and
Wherea*. The e.-.id proposition seemed at the
meeting to meet the approval or Messrs. Car
rick and Skemp, but immediately after the
jneetlns they were Joined by P. IV McCarthy.

Rival Factions of Painters'

Possession of Property
Franz, Handel, more Schumann and
the big aria from "Samson et'Dalila"
of Saint-Saens were among the new de
lights introduced to us by Schumann-
Heink last night. at her second concert.
Further acquaintance only reveals
deeper treasures in this glorious sing
er's gift. She is big as Bauer is bigâ
as I thought and some one else said.
Her art is as nobly sufficient, tonic,
refreshing. One . can . sit back and
simply enjoy without reserve anything
the woman does, thanking the gods for
whatever critical faculty one possesses
in that it conduces only to further en
joyment. The vocal dimensions are
enormous, yet suffice only to voice the
greatness of heart and soul of the
singer. She has in truth a Titanic note,
as greatly sweet as it Is full, as finely
fine in its pianissimo as it is sweet.
In Handel's "Lascia" Schumann-
Heink found the noblest legato, great
full-breathed phrase, masterly in
its poise. The "Samson et Dallla"
aria â oh, so well accompanied by Miss
Hartman! â was given with utmost
dramatic magnificence. The singer's
notable capacity, for picture making
was notably exhibited in .the Schu
mann "Der Arme Peter" and the little
Schubert "Wohin." The latter was re
peated to a thunderous encore. Its rep
etition evoked another. Then Madame
came out to open her humorous mouth
into its biggest smile. The smile
evoked another. But we charitably let
her go then. As on Tuesday, the Hugo
Wolf "Heimweh," that was wisely re
peatedâlet ub have it again oh Satur-'
day, Madame â was encored lustily. It
is all sorts delicious. "The Lord Is
Near," with its fine religious fervor
highly attained by the singer, was
again given, and the altogether delight
ful '"Fruhlingslied" (Becker) was an
other. Saturday afternoon all of us as
is us goes again. â¢ '
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Margaret Giblin Attacked
by Man Admitted to Flat
Where She Is Employed
Margaret Giblin, a domestic, em
ployed by Mra. Agnes J. Connolly, a
teacher in the public schools, living
at 1319 Leavenworth street, was as
saulted by an unknown youns man on
Wednesday morning in the hallway of
her employer's first-floor flat.' . The
police believe the deed was prompted
by enmity for Mrs. Connolly and that
Miss Giblin's assailant mistook" her for
her mistress.
Mrs. Connolly owns the Rats at
1315-1319 Leavenworth street and re
cently had trouble with one of her
tenants, Mrs. Alice Andrews, who oc
cupied the flat No. 1315. Mrs. An
drews changed her abode several
weeks ago, and, according to Captain
Martin of the detective - force, sho
vowed at that time to be revenged on
Mrs. Connolly. The police are 'inves
tigating the possibility of any connec
tion existing between this alleged
threat and the attack on Mrs. Con
nolly's maid.
On Wednesday morning at 9 o'clock.
Miss Glblin was summoned to the door
by the ringing of the bell. A stranger
said he had seen a notice on the door
of No. 1315 announcing that the flat
was to 'let and directing inquirers to
No. 1319 for the key. The girl went
back Into the flat after admitting the
stranger tothe entry, where' he closed
the front door and sat down;'- When
she returned with the key in her hand
he sprang up and grasped. her by the
throat, saying, "I , don't want the key,
but I am going : to kill you." â¢
With one hand over Miss -GIblln's
mouth to prevent her from crying out
and the other clasped' tightly about
her throat, the thug tried to throw her
to the - floor, but the yowng woman
wrested herself from his gTip and fled
screaming Into: the rear rooms. Her
assailant escaped into the street and
has not been.seen'Binc-". Miss Giblin's
throat and lips were cut by. the man's
nails and the light waist she wore was
torn off her shoulders. The case was
reported, at police headquarters by
Mrs. Connolly' and - Detective Bailey
was detailed on it, but no arrest has
been made. . .
Miss Qiblln describes her assailant
as being about 2 5 -.years old, tall, fair,
smooth-faced, good looking, of slight
build and wearing a black sack suit
and derby hat-
Mrs. Andrews was not to be found
last evening :at the. St. Louis apart
ments, where she now resides, but her
sister said 'that both the ladies had
been absent' from the city for three
weeks.. returning only yesterday morn
ings "The. idea that my sister could
have had any connection with this af
fair Is absurd," she.added- i,

Famous Filipino Warriors Volunteer
to Aid Memory of Departed
Chaplain of the Army.
Tents will be folded at the camp of
the Filipino Scouts next Tuesday.
Their departure was set for an earlier
date, but strenuous efforts on the part
of ihe McKinnon memorial committee
have availed to keep them here, long
enough to participate in the military
and athletic carnival to be held at Me
chanics* Pavilion next Monday for the
benefit of the fund. It is seldom that
the United States military authorities
change any plans, but in this case an
exception has been made. The Fili
pinos will be permitted to remain long
enough to participate in the entertain
ment.
Throughout the entire army the
name of the kindly soldier priest is
still held in reverence and affection.
The little brown men themselves are
delighted to hear that they will be able
to remain here to participate , In the
beneftt. They have been rehearsing
daily to make this exhibition, which
Â¦will be their only public appearance
here, an emphatic success.
When a Filipino once takes anything
to heart it requires a long time to
make him forget it and the Scouts
having once been told that they would
be able to help raise funds for the Mc-
Kinnon monument would be broken
Jiearted if the opportunity should be
taken from them. They look forward
with delight to seeing the beautiful
bronze memorial which they will have
helped to erect when they return from
the St. Louis Exposition. .
Resides the drill of the Scouts, there
will be the best that the Olympic Club
has in the way of athletics. As soon
as the Filipinos leave the floor boxers
and wrestlers will appear everywhere
at the same time, so that the specta
tors will be almost dazzled with feats
of brawn and skill. Every dollar col
lected will be devoted to the founding
of a memorial to Father McKlnnon,
the departed chaplain of the First Cal
ifornia Regiment. Tickets to- the ben
efit can be had at Sherman & Clay's
music store and at the First Regiment
Armory.

OPPOSES THE REPEAL f:
OF DESERT LAND LAWS
Delegate Wilson of Arizona Says Pros

WASHINGTON, April 7.â Delegate
Wilson of Arizona^ was heard to-day
by the House Committee on Irrigation
of Arid Lands in opposition to the re
peal of desert land laws. Wilson
pointed'out the interest of the rail
roads in the repeal of desert land laws
to be this: : That it will be impossible
for home seekers to take up lands un
der: the homestead act requiring five,
years' ijesidence, because the lands
cannot be made fertile until water has
been secured, taking three or four
years; ,that, under the desert land- laws
settlers can- buy; these'- lands from the
Government, 'make "their improve
ments and get,; the lands in producing
condition, before moving on to the
lands. By repealing the desert land
laws this procedure would be stopped
and prgspective settlers : would be
compelled to buy their lands of the
railroads.

HAWLEY TELLS
OF THE POOL
. WASHINGTON, April 7.â The Sen
ate to-day listened .to eulogies of the
late Senator Hanna. The galleries were
well tilled and the. speakers were given
close attention! Those who spoke were
Foraker, Scott, Cockrell, Platt of Con
necticut, . Cullom. Blackburn, Elklns.
Fairbanks, Daniel, Perkins, Depew,
Beverldge, Dolllver, Kearns and Dick.
Senator Foraker said that Senator
Hanna's relation to President McKIn
ley had naturally rendered him "domi
nant in Ohio politics." These matters
of the past, said the Senator, were
brought up only for the purpose of
illustrating the point of view from
which he had studied 'the man. He
said:
"In the grave with him He -buried
all differences, all hostilities, all preju
dices and all unkindness of feeling of
every sort that ever at any time may
have been entertained."
He did not believe that if living
Hanna would want other than a frank
discussion of his qualities. Continuing,
Foraker said:
"To those who knew him only as I
knew him for the first four years of
our acquaintance he was an unusually
lovable man. He was bright, cheery,
generous, kind, strong and ever ready
to practice self-denial, especially when
it involved the nreferment of a friend.
These qualities were so pronounced and
bo manifest that none other could well
be seen by those who looked through
only the partial eyes of friendship."
Touching upon Hanna's political ca
reer. Fairbanks referred to the - men
tion of Hanna's name in connection
with the approachig Presidential con
test, saying that the suggestion needed
only the encouragement of his assist
ance to make It a formidable reality,
but that -Hanna was satisfied , with his
seat in the Senate.
In telling of the attacks made on
Hanna, particularly during the sec
ond McKinley campaign, when he
formed the subject for cartoons in
many newspapers, Scott related the
following Incident:
"I shall never forget one morning
when he handed me a New York paper
containing a cartoon of himself, pic
tured as a huge monster clad in a suit
covered over with dollar marks, smok
ing an immense cigar and trampling
under foot women and children until
? heir eyes protruded from the sockets
and their skeleton forms writhed in
agony. After I looked at it a moment
he said to me: 'That hurts, when I
have tried . all my life to put myself
in the other fellow's place; when I
have tried to help those in need and
to lighten the burdens of those less
fortunate than myself, to be pictured
as I am here; to be held up to the gaze
of the 'world as a murderer 'of- women
and children. I tell you it hurts." and,
looking up into the frank, manly face,
1 saw â¢ th? tears courslng^down" his
cheeks, and he turned and silently
walked away." \
Perkins ' related a conversation he
bad with Hanna concerning the Salva
tion Army on Ihe occasion of the din
ner given by the Ohio Senator to Gen
eral Booth.
"I asked him," said Perkins, '"if he
believed in the principles of the Sal
vation Army, and he replied: 'I be
lieve in tho practical effect of the
work in which the Salvation Army is
engaged. It is redeeming thousands
WASHINGTON. April 7.â John W.
Kalua, United States Judge of the Sec
ond Circuit Court at Honolulu, was re
moved from office to-day by President
Roosevelt.
Recently an intimation was conveyed
to Judge Kalua that on the expiration
of his term on June 6 next he would not
be reappointed. A few days after the
Judge practically suspended the work
of his court by adjourning all pending
criminal cases until June 6. This action
elicited a vigorous protest from the
people of Honolulu. The protest, in for
mal shape, reached Attorney General
Knox yesterday. He took up the sub
ject with the President and it was de
cided to remove Judge Kalua at once
from office and to appoint a successor
who would conduct the business of the
court.
The President to-day signed the N order
for Judge Kalua's removal. His suc
cessor has not been agreed upon yet,
but an appointment probably will be
sent to the Senate in a few days.
HONOLULU, April 7.â A. X. Kepoi
kai. Treasurer of the Territory of Ha
waii, resigned his office to-day. Ke
poikai has announced himself as a can
didate for the Circuit Judgeship, made
vacant by the removal of John W.
Kalua.
1 MAYWOOD, /111., April 7.âSixty
three Indians in a special car en route

during- a. f og. . ' Three of the Indians

The trains which collided' were the
Oregon Express and the fast mail ; on
the Chicago^ and NoVthwestern Rail
way. The express train was run into
by the mail train. Both trains were
eastbound/ Â« Â¦â¢_ '
The . coach containing the Indians
was a light day car. It was complete
ly wrecked. < The rear end of the coach
ahead was'also damaged.
After the collision the passengers in
the, other coaches of the two trains
hurried to the rescue and after a hard
struggle pulled the injured from . be
neath the wreckage. Chief White
Horse, in charge of the Indians on the
train, was fatally injured. The bodies
of the Indians who had been . killed
outright were laid pn the prairie beside
the track. Chief White Horse being
carried with them. He said he knew
that death was near a"nd requested
that he be placed near his dead com
panions. The chief was â¢ propped up
and sat stoically while physicians
worked over his wounds^ He smoked a
pipe quietly and showed no signs of
the pain he must have been , suffering.
One by one the other, injured Indians
were slowly taken from the splintered
car and placed upon "he ground near
their dying chief and their; dead com
rades.' The physicians hurried from
one to another, of the injured, adminis
tering to the wants of all, while ar
rangements were being made to take
them to the nearest hospital.
A moment after the ciash there was
not a sound from the ill-fated coach.
When " one ;â¢ by one those surviving tha
crash regained, in part their senses
they began to shout for aid. A terri
fying series of wild yell*= from the In
dians were heard by the Â¦ passengers
jumping from the cars ahead. All the
men passengers and many of the wo
men on board the two trains hastened
to the aid of the injured Indians. The
fact that- one sido of the rear car fell
out with the impact undoubtedly saved
the lives of many Indians who were
thrown out on, the nrairie. â¢
The Indians were from the reserva
tion near Rushville, Neb., and their
journey 'eastward was primarily for
show purposes at New York.
It was a pitiable sight to see the In
dians lying on the ground, clad, in
their native costumes, with their red
blankets dyed -deeper by the blood of
their friends. The men were of splen
did physique and the . exhibition of
calm nerve on the part of Horse
was la good example for the other
members of the Indian party.
After-' the bodies of the dead had
been removed from the wreckage and
placed in a row on the. prairie beside
the tracks an incident probably un
paralleled In railroad accidents took
place. t The uninjured; among the In
dians gathered about and, led by Chief
Irontail, solemnly chanted the Indian
"death song."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, April 7. â One death
resulted from an attack of a shark
upon a United States " navy boat in
Guantanamo harbor, Cuba, on March
19, and Boatswain Paul Hennig and his
wife narrowly escaped drowning*'? ; : A
peculiar story is contained . in the, re
port of the court; of inquest just re
ceived at the Navy Department.
Boatswain Hennig, ...J stationed v at
Guantanamo, went into' the -harborÂ«.in
a small boat about 10 o'clock at night
with the intention of putting his wife
aboard a Santiago steamer, which
passed about 11 o'clock.,. Edwin Robin
son, a negro seaman and -another, sea
man named Longwell were at the oars.
The boat paused 'in ,the middle. of the
channel and its occupants watched for
the steamer lights. There ; was a rush
of water beneath . the gunwales, a
heavy blow was struck the ( boat, a'rip
ping sound was heard "and the boat
began to fill with water through a hole
twelve inches long arid , three ; inches
wide. Robinson tried' to .stop the leak
with his reefer but failed. All but
Robinson jumped overboard. Hennig
and wife clung to the boat until res
cued *by the cruiser- Columbia's launch,
but Sailor Longwell ;' was [ drowned.
Robinson remained . seated in the boat
until rescued. Surgeon C. DeW.
Brownell of the Amphitrite examined,
under a microscope a bit of enamel
found stuck in the .wood of Â£lie boat
and pronounced ,it - a . bit of a shark's
tooth.
The court of Inquiry, which consisted
of Lieutenant W. A. Moffltt of the Am
phitrite, Lieutenant W. R. Cushman
and Ensign E. S. Jackson, declared the
accident was unavoidable and that the
injury was inflicted by- a shark. They
also found Robinson guilty of coward
ice. He has left the service. Â¦ .

BARCELONA Spain, April 7.â King
Alfonso, accompanied by Premier Mau
ra and War Minister Linares, started
this morning on a round of visits to
factories, where he conversed with. the
working people, praised their labor and
declared that one of his greatest de
sires was to adequately protect the
workmen. He also visited the work
men's quarters, many of which were
.decorated. Everywhere the King was
accorded a most cordial welcome.
The Italie. the organ of the Foreign
Office, congratulates King Alfonso on
his escape.
MADRID, April 7.â Private accounts
received from Barcelona regarding the
explosion- which took place as King
Alfonso was leaving the exhibition
there yesterday continue to vary in
detail. The official report of the affair
bae been issued here:
"At 9:30 o'clock yesterday evening a
petard exploded *in the portico of the
house at 19 Rambla Delcentro. There
was a loud explosion, which caused
material damage. In the ensuing panic
two persons were slightly injured.
"King Alfonso passed the spot within
a few minutes after the occurrence and
was warmly cheered by the crowd,
which had become tranquil. ;â¢
. "The originator of the outrage has
not been discovered. One man was ar
rested, but has since been released."
ROME, April 7.â The Patria says:
"An enormous crowd "waited for King
Alfonso outside the exhibition building,
where there was no military cordon,
and the crowd was thus enabled to
approach the royal carriages, although
surrounded by a number of detectives.
When the King appeared, followed by
Premier Maura, there was a great out
burst of applause, to which he respond
ed with smiles and by saluting in mili
tary fashion. While the King was
stepping Into his carriage a sharp ex
plosion was heard, followed by cries of
pain. His Majesty turned around, with
out showing any emotion, and Pre
mier Maura urged him" to proceed^
"The crowd abandoned the royal car
riages and surrounded the place where
the two persons wounded by the ex
plosion were lying. The bomb had been
thrown without well calculating the
distance and it exploded, wounding two
sightseers who were applauding the
King. The Kjng remained on the spot
until the two wounded persons had
been removed to a hospital, and then
he received an enthusiastic ovation.
"One man was arrested. His name
was kept secret, but it is doubtful if
in the confusion the police seized the
real culprit, as especially no one pres
ent .was able to tell exactly from
where the bomb was thrown."
When this suspicious circumstance
was reported the detectives examined
the cabin and found that the bandits
must have stayed there for five days
before the night they donned masks
and went to Copley, five miles north,
to hold up the Oregon express. They
must have returned to 'the cabin after
having Engineer Joe Sink haul them
to Keswick station from the scene of
their crime, then endeavored unsuc
cessfully to dispose of all evidence and
left for parts Unknown.
In the water at the bottom of a fifty
foot shaft the_ detectives found the
clothes the menÂ« wore while holding up
the train and in the cabin they. found
a strap from which a piece was cut
to form a shoulder strap for the bag
in which the dynamite was carried.
A San Francisco paper of five succes
sive issues previous to the date of the
hold-up established in the detectives'
minds the length of time the men were
at the Nigger Hill mine.
The lineman who put the detectives
on the right scent gave a good descrip
tion of the man who opened the cabin
door for him. The o.uce.rs are satis

lived near Whiskytown and who, with
two bachelor neighbors, was suspected
of havine held up the ,Weaverville
stage In June. 1903, as the three quietly
left the Whiskytown region a short
time previous to the Copley hold-up
and have not since returned.
REDDING, April 7.â Wells-FargO
and Southern Pacific detectives work
ing here on the Copley train robbery
case have found where the three ban
dits stayed for five days previous to
committing the crime and have prac
tically established the identity of the
highwaymen. They have no idea, how
ever, of the men's present whereabouts.
While planning the hold-up the men
who later killed Messenger O'Neil were
rendezvoused in a deserted mining cab
in at the Nigger Hill mine, a mile west
of the town of Keswick. This cabin %
belongs to R. O. Dunn, who has been
the agent for Wells-Fargo in *edding
ever since the express company estab
lished an office here.
The detectives learned of the rendez
vous from a lineman who sought ad
mission to a supposedly unoccupied
cabin a couple of days previous to the
robbery. He found three men in the
little shack. One of them opened the
door ever so slightly, gave an evasive
answer to a question and then closed
the door.
i louse is being: brought face to face
with a proposition to repudiate sil
ver. A record vote is unavoidable,
and the situation brought abtfut. with
its bearing on the coming Presiden
tial campaign, is the most interesting
from a political standpoint now in
Congress.
The Finance Committee of the Sen
ate has reported favorably a bill to
remove the limit on the pur
chase of silver bullion for subsidiary
coin and has rwommended that it be
Inserted in the sundry civil appropria
tion bill. This will be done by the
Appropriation Committee, and, ac
cording to present plans, .the Senate
will pass it. The Senate has never
been averse to passing silver legisla
tion, so long as the House was largely
â¢ Republican and stood ready to act as
a check.
The effect of the Senate amendment
would be to leave the law of 1873
practically in operation, thus permit
ting the Secretary of the Treasury to
purchase silver for subsidiary coinage
to any extent he might see fit. When
this Senate amendment goes to Che
House in conference rejiort on the
sundry civil bill Representative Hem
enway will move to accept the
amendment, provided it is changed
so that standard silver dollars now
stored in the treasury, to the amount
of $500,000,000, can be recoined to
provide for subsidiary coin as de
manded.
This would have the effect of still
limiting the purchase of silver bul
lion and would again bring the Dem
ocratic mjnority face to face with the
silver issue.
John Sharp Williams, the minority
leader, has told the Republican lead
ers that he could not agree to support
the Hemenway amendment. In other
words, the Democrats of the House
propose to stand for the Senate
amendment removing the limit on the
purchase of silver bullion.
The amendment which Hemenway
will propose is similar in effect to the
proposition contained in the Hill cur
rency bill reported by the House
Committee on Banking and Currency
to-day, calling for the recoinage of
standard silver dollars into subsidiary
coin. This section of the bill was re
ported by a majority of but two In
committee, .the Democrats oppos
ing tt.

the limit on subsidiary coinage, per

the second leads through a hilly defile,
turning first northward and then west

range to Liaoyang.
"The Russian commander can hard

Yalu or in front of the defile and hills,
but the Japanese commander couhi
wish for nothing better. He would,
probably, in that case, cross the Yalu

suming it to be strong enough, would
compel the Russians t~ retreat and
leave open the passage for the left

"The Japanese now appear to hold the

Russia recognizes that Japan now
has preponderating naval strength in
the Far East. Therefore it is essential
to reverse, the present - Japanese , pre
ponderance. This will be attempted
by two distinct moves: : :â¢ â
First, urgent efforts -will be made to
have a naval concentration at Port
Arthur, the Baltic, Red Sea and.Vlad
ivostok fleets joining Vice Admiral
Makaroff's command if possible, and
.thus giving the combined fleets pre
ponderance ovex Vice Admiral Togo's.
Second, it is foreseen that it .will be
difficult and probably impossible to
'effect this concentration, as Admiral
Togo may intercept the Baltic fleet be
fore Its arrival- at Port Arthur. In
that, event the Baltic fleet, which is
comparatively small, will attempt the
perilous task of engaging . the large
Japanese fleet in the hope of disabling
soirfe of the Japanese ships and thus
reducing the Japanese effectiveness.
According to the Russian calculations
the Baltic fleet may suffer annihilation
in such an uneaual combat, but it will
have served a valuable end "if It is
able to cripple a sufficient number of
Japanese ships . to reduce Admiral
Togo's naval strength below that of
Admiral Makaroff.
The foregoing information is not part
of current speculative report, but comes
from creditable official sources, as be

authorities in Washington will receive
similar information shortly.

Genera] Mobilization of the
Perennial Disturbances Are Without
Political Significance.
SEOUL. Korea, April 7. â Chi Min
Heui, a former Minister to the United
States, has been appointed Minister
to Japan In place of Hyun Tons Un,
who was appointed on April 1, but
who refused to accept the post.
Hayashl, the Japanese Minister to
Korea, claims, that the murder of
three Japanese merchants in the prov
ince of Chengcheng was due to inter
nal disorders. It is also reported that
the Tong-Hak risings in co-operation
with disbanded Korean soldiers in the
vicinity of Pingyang are nothing. but
the usual perennial disturbances and
have no significance politically.
Toward midnight the streets pre
sented weird nnd picturesque scenes.
From all the churches issued streams
of people, each person bearing a lighted
candle. The boulevards and even the
narrow alleys seemed filled with hurry
ing, ghostly figures, each one trying
hard with cloak or hood or hands to
screen the tiny flame of the wax taper
from the wind.
The Dowager Empress, who never
before has failed to be present at the
festivities attending the birthday of her
father. King Christian of Denmark, will
not be at Copenhagen to-morrow, it
being the unwritten law of Russia that
no member of the imperial family shall
leave the empire in time of .war.
â¢ v
ACTIVITY OF THE TOXG-HAKS.
while the'gospels were being read with
in. .During to-night's service. In every
sacred edifice each member of the con
gregation held a lighted taper, which
was subsequently taken home and
placed before an ikon of the devotee's
patron saint. . . .
The Emperor and the imperial famllr
attended a similar service in the church
of the Winter Palace. later taking the.
sacrament with the Dowager Empress
at the Anitchkoff Palace.
The Emperor stood throughout the
long rite at thc Winter Palace.
The great bells of hundreds of cathe
drals and churches In St. Petersburg
tolled solemnly, at intervals to-night
With the exception of the soldiers and
sailors in the Far East every Orthodox
Russian to-day began a three days'
fast. As a military measure, to guard
against possible surprises by the enemy
while the Emperor's legions are debil
itated by abstinence from food, special
dispensations have been granted to the
men, relieving them of their religious
duties of fasting and confessing.
In all the churches of the empire to
day solemn scenesâ the last supper, the
washing of feet, the betrayal, the Judg
ment and the sentenceâ were impres
sively re-enacted.
In the Russian capital the greatest
interest centered in the ceremony in
St. Isaac's Cathedral, where the rites
and ceremonials were conducted on a'
scale of great magnificence, the Met
ropolitan of St. Petersburg, who wore
upon his head a miter ablaze with dia
monds, impersonating the Savior and
the chief Bishops of the province rep
resenting ' the disciples. From early
morning the vast' cathedral was
thronged with the devout and unnum
bered thousands surrounding the build
ing were unable to gain admission.
Among the congregation were many
women dressed in spotless white, who
had come to take the communion. Most
of those outside the cathedral remained
there j.11 day at their devotions, sway
ing and crossing- themselves, and at
interval?, as the service proceeded,
prostrating their bodies and touching
the floor with their foreheads. All the
foreign diplomats, including - United
States Embassador McCcrmick, were
present.
EMPEROR ATTENDS RITES.
General rain throughout Russia
marked the Inauguration of the Easter
hclidaysi an augury, according to the
popular legend, of bountiful crops.
Business and all Government work
were suspended as customary. The an
nunciation of the Virgin was signal
ized by various traditional observances
â birds were set free, bonfires were
built, holy bread was placed in the bins
for, luck and the village girls unplaited
their hair.
Vice Admiral Stark has received the
Order of St. Vladimir, and Rear Ad
miral Prince Ukhtomsky has been
decorated with the Order of St. Stan
islaus in recognition of their able de
fense on the occasion of the Japanese
torpedo-tboat attack on Port Arthur on
February 5. The Order of St. Vladimir
has been bestowed upon Captain Reit
.".enstein for his able handling of the
Vladivostok squadron.
A special dispatch from Port Arthur
describes how the cruisers Bayan and
Novik. during the attack on Port Ar
thur on March 27, covered the torpedo
boat destroyer Silni, which was
aground, from the enemy's fire, hauling
her off the shoal and bringing her back
to port. It further describes how, sub
sequently, the whole Russian fleet
sailed out of the harbor and formed in
line of battle, ready to accept a com
bat, which the Japanese declined.
Three of the Japanese fire ships sunk
In attempts to block the harbor have
been raised and towed into the harbor
at Port Arthur, where they are being
armed with rapid-fire guns for service
against the enemy.
The Novokral of Port Arthur, in its
issue of March 13, received here to-day,
reviews the utterances of some Amer
ican papers to show that American
aims are altogether selfish, being mo
nopolized by the open-door policy with
out mentioning the yellow peril, which
monopolizes the attention of the Rus
sians in the Far East.
THREE DAYS' FAST BEGINS.
A correspondent of the Vostchny
Vostnik Btates that many of those
slightly wounded in the first Ixom
bardment of Port Arthur have died as
a result of # the poisonous gases em
anating fro'm the Japanese shells. He
notes that many of the enemy's pro
jectiles fall In or near the hospital,
and adds that it has been determined
to evacuate the City Hospital at-Dalny
if that place is bombarded, because of
an unwillingness to trust to the hu
manity of the Japanese.
DECORATION' FOR STARK.
A correspondent of the Novostl,
writing frcm Liaoyang on March 13,
says that that small town has been
transformed into a military city as a
result of the arrival of many troops.
Living has become extremely expen
sive, due to the inability of merchants
to obtain private freight. No goods
are allowed to be shipped to Liaoyang
from Port Arthur. A table of prices
shows that the necessaries of life had
risen to two and three times the nor
mal prices. American beer was quoted
at 50 cents a bottle, whereas before
the war it brought only 10 cents. No
relief from the high prices can be had.
as the military requires the use of
practically all the space in the railroad
cars.
The Admiralty has received informa
tion that a Japanese squadron has
been cruising oft Port Arthur since
yesterday.
While the first line of defense against
the Japanese advance from Korea is
a strong: position, selected by General
Kuropatkin, near Fensvrang Cheng, it
Is believed the Russians Intend to hold
out as long as possible at Antung,
which commands the Peking road. The
place has many natural advantages for
defense. General Kurolci's army, ac
cording to* Russian advices. Is strung
out along^ the road between Anju and
Wiju. its advance being severely im
peded by bad reads, which make it dlf
l'.eult to push forward the supplies,
which are delivered by coolies, requir
ing eight days, a march from Chongju
to the Yalu. For seventy miles the
river is &00 fathoms wide and at Yong
ainpho it is Ice-laden and barred by
Islands, whence the Russian sharp
shooters can harass the Japanese ad
vance.
ENTRENCHED XKAR HAIGHENG.
The Russians have entrenched them
selves heavily near Haicheng to block
the progress of the Japanese, in case
they succeed In landing at the head of
the LJaotung Qulf.
ST. PETERSBURG. April 7.â General
Kuropatkln, who -arrJved at New
chwang on Wednesday and inspected
4000 troops there, greeting them In the
name of the Emperor, also inspected the
defensive works of the town and held
a conference with the commanders. It
is reported here that he found the
tioops In good health and spirits.
The Russian volunteer fleet steam
ship Kasan, damaged during the first
bombardment of Port Arthur, has been
converted into a hospital ship.
The peasant industries exhibit, for
merly intended for St. Louis, was being
sold at auction to-day for the benefit
of the Red Cross Society. It Includes
wood, leather and metal work, lace and
embroidery artistically executed in
characteristic Russian style, and moun
tains of ingenious toys, all selling for
a song.

In substance these 'resolutions de
mand that there shall be a : periodical
inspection : of the . boarding-houses of
Berkeley, and in this undertaking the
co-operation of the town of Berkeley
will be sought, j In addition the resolu
tions say that it is # desirable that data
be collected from the students them
selves in regard to their own health
and the nature of the houses that they
inhabit. . :
The resolutions are the outgrowth of
the effort of President Wheeler to se
cure a better state of,- health for the
university population. The first step in
this direction was taken several months
ago, when he submitted a plan for, the
Improvement of the drainage system on
the university grounds. The resolutions
will betaken up by the Academic Coun
cil to-morrow. â¢ . > â¢ , -
The deans of the various colleges at
the university are the gentlemen op
posed to so many landladies. Perhaps
they have had some such experience as
students now suffer in their own : college
days. At any rate they passed a set
of resolutions to-day that will be sub
mitted to the Academic Council for
consideration. % . â¢
It is said that the Berkeley boarding
house does not even approach the ideal.
In some of them, tradition says, the
butter is not ahove reproach. In others
an indigestible species of pie is served.
Still others dole out coffee that is cof
fee in name only, quoth the student

tions of soup, that are so sparse as to
call for a tipping of the plate for every
spoonful. Â¦ â¢ X~x Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦ ~-
All this radicalism and upheaving of
traditions is due directly to a sudden
conclusion on the part of the univer
sity authorities to devote some atten
tion to the physical health of the uni
versity. They think that better food
may have some 'effect on the quality
and quantity of brains nourished!
The boarding-houses of Berkeley will
be subjected to the scrutiny. of the fac

Berkeley boarding-houses have long
been the butt of the wits of the univer
sity and the town, and abundant and
various are the puns that have been
cracked at the expense of the boarding
house landlady. But now the boarding
house is to be taken up seriously and
exploited in a way. that will be thor
oughly scientific.

"The predominating Ufe at the great
depths is the starfish and the sea
urchin. The sea urchin is most abun
dant in individuals and kinds. The offi
cers of the vessel say that many en
tirely new specimens were procured,
and " we took thousands that remain to
be classified. It will be some time be
fore we know of just what value the
expedition is to science, as it will re
quire considerable research." A

the expedition at all places, and science

William B. Ititter, professor of
zoology at the University of California,
returned yesterday from a voyage on
the steamer Albatross, having been en
gaged for the last month in collecting
specimens of sea life for scientific re
search. Professor Ititter was the leader
of the expedition, of which the other
members were Professor C. H. Gilbert
and F. A. Spaulding, of the zoological
department of Stanford University, and
L. H. Miller of the zoological depart
ment of the University of California.,
The expedition was arranged for by
the United States Bureau of Fisheries,
which placed the Albatross at the serv
ice of the scientists. The entire month
was spent in sounding and dredging the
ocean off San Dipgo, although most of
the work was carried on about Point
Lioma, Lrfi Jolla and Catalina Islands.
Some dredging was done about 240 miles
off Point Concepclon, this being the far
thest tho stamer sailed from laind. Here
the abysmal depths begin, the sound
ings ranging anywhere from 10,000 .to
14,000 feet.
"It was in these great depths that we
found the most Interesting specimens
of sea life," said Professor Ritter to
night. "There is an abundance of life
there and it is surprising the gorgeous
colors the inhabitants wear. One would
think that the colors would be somber,
but on the contrary they are both strik
ing and various. The range of color
is astonishing.

Joseph Olympia, the San Leandro
Constable who took it upon himself to
release Guy E. Covey because of a
defective warrant given him, is prob
ably safe from the proceedings begun
against him to oust him from office,
as Judge Hall, before whom the mat
ter came up to-day, intimated that he
was of the opinion that Olympia had
acted within his rights. The matter,
however, was continued until Saturday
to give the attorneys further time to
look up the law in. the case.
Covey is being pursued by a relent
less spouse, who has followed him for
months from one city tc- another. While
Mrs. Covey was : presiding over an in
teresting family event in Seattle Covey
instituted- divorce proceedings against
her here. Through the papers she lo
cated him in Alameda County and later
found him at work at San Leandro.
In order to secure him she swore to
a criminal charge for failure to sup
port his infant child and the warrant
was given to Olympia to serve.
The Constable arrested Covey, but
when it was pointed out to him that
Justice of the Peace Black of San Le
andro had no jurisdicticn over an al
leged crime committed in Seattle, and
that a. wife could in no case swear to
a complaint against her husband,
Olympia released Covey, who lost no
time in taking advantage of the situa
tion and disappearing. Mrs. Covey's
attorneys were very wroth thereat and
filed accusations against Olympia for
exceeding his authority, with the view
of taking his office away from him.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Cases of three; scavengers in Judge
Samuels' court were continued to-day
until April 11. at request of Attorney
James Creoley, representing the gar
bage collectors. The attorney said he
desired that one case be selected upon
which to carry a test to the Supreme
Court. The scavengers desired that
they should be unmolested while the
litigation is in progress. City author
ities declared that such a step would
defeat" the nbjocts of.^the ordinance,
namely, to give the city a. modern and
sanitary method of garbage disposal.
The people in the neighborhood of it are
the only ones whwÂ»*hould be listened to, and
aÂ« to them, they -should not complain until
they see from its actual operation that it is
injurious to them. If they are reasonable

Mayor Olney to-day supplemented his
explanations of yesterday with a for
mal statement concerning the existing
conditions. He said:
The lam- relating to the disposal of garbage
will bÂ« enforced. Gathering the earbago of
a city by private pcaveng-ern and dumping it
on vacant ground on the windward side of
the city *avorÂ« of barber! *m. It is only one
stop beyond not collecting It at all. The
public health require* that the disposal of
(rarlmpe rhould be' done, systematically and
scientifically. The courts have' hold that it
1* a Question of police power to preserve the
health of the pÂ«"ople, and from the very
nature cf the case the collection and disposal
of the garbage mut=t rest in the city author
ities. It is a natural monopoly like supplying
watf-r or ras, and courts will not interfere
with the regulation* established by tho city.'
I hear that, money Js being rained to fight
the garbage ordinance*. It is a foolish wa?te
of money. Supooee the courts should poir.i
out some technical objections to the present
ordinances, what then? The Council would
immediately psj<s other ordinances obvmtuiK
the obi^ct ions. Â¦
The garbage of the | rity will be , collected
under city lam - s and burned. There Is' no
other way unlen We prefer the barbarism of
an uncivilized people. ... ...
If. in actufj' ex^H'rtence. the crematory
proves to I* a nuisance In the neighborhood,
Orders to the police are to continue to
make arrests without cessation. The
scavengers have insisted to-day that
the crusade would not prevent them
from carrying on their usual work un
til, at least, the ordinance had been
tested In the courts and decision
should rest against them.
In compliance with Instructions from
the Board of Police and Fire Commis
sioners, the Chief of Police to-day re
sumed the arrest of scavengers who
are charged with collecting garbage in
violation of the garbage Incinerating
ordinance. More than thirty arrests
were made during the day. By request
of the scavengers' attorney, nominal
bail was fixed. In some cases the
same man was arrested twice, as he
resumed collections, as soon as he had
been released on bail in the first in
stance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, April 7.
. Fifth and last on the list of alleged
delinquents comes Policeman W. H.
Smith. Patrolman Smith was sus
pended from duty last night by the
Chief of Police, who says he saw the
policeman dangling his legs from the
counter of a Japanese shoe store near
Thirtieth street and San Pablo ave
nue, instead of tramping his beat. And
this Is the grist that will confront the
Police Commissioners at their meeting
to-morrow afternoon.
Police Matron Mrs. Reed Is charged
with unduly exposing 1 a woman pris
oner under search. Patrolman Cor
nelius Keef e is under fire for an al
leged unwarranted arrest, but not
much stock is taken in this charge.
Keefe patrols a very hard beat and
his superiors say it must be controlled
with a firm hand.
The list of alleged delinquents is
headed by Policeman John P. Scan-
Ian. That officer stands accused of
violating a rule of the department and
the law of the State by betting on a
prizefight. Also is Scanlan charged
with kicking John J. Mulvey. a crip
pled newsboy, with whom he had a
dispute over a bet on the Britt-Cor
bett fight.
Next comes Policeman A. J. Hall,
whose divers and contradictory stories
concerning his alleged encounter with
burglars in North Oakland several
weeks ago, coupled with his alleged
frequent reporting off duty, miles away
from his beat, has caused the Police
Commissioners to investigate. Hall's
conduct during the encounter with the
surprised burglars at Henry Herr's
residence in North Oakland has led
the police officials to the belief that
Hall, to put it mildly, lost his nerve
and did not act as a brave policeman
should have conducted himself in an
emergency.
There is a screw loose in the Oak
land Police Department. No less than
five patrolmen or other persons, sub
ject to the Police Commissioners' au
thority are under the cloud of charges
of various kinds. The t>ercentage is
out of proportion to the number of
patrolmen on the police force, sixty
flve all told..

Thpre will- be no appeal taken on
behaJf of Luigi Orio, the Italian con
victed of the murder of L. tirauiano,
nnd whrn the man comes up for sen
tence to-morrow nothing more will be
dune than to make a plea for the mercy
of ihe court. Attorney A. 1* Flick will
do this. The trial of the case was such
that it is announced there is no ground
for exceptions and the only hope is of
Orio's previous good character and'that
the circumstances of the crime may in
fluence the Judge in his behalf.
Orio and the murdered man were
blends, but quarreled over money mat
tors, and, meeting in thÂ»Â» dark the same
fvonlng of thole quarrel, Oratziano fell
the victim of Orio's wrath.. He was
Fli-it through the node and lingered for
week* before finally succumbing to his
wound. In defense OriiÂ» says that it
was dark and that when they recog
nized each other Gratrinn.o had threat
ened him. He also paid that the dead
man had saJd when they finished their
fight earlier in the day. that he would
kill him.* Orlo'p statement of the shoot
inp. however, was denied by the 12
year-old son of <Jratziano. who was
with his father nt the time he was
phot, and who testified that* Orio shot
Â«? soon as they were close enough to
re<-oÂ£nijt<Â» each ether.
Orio was found puilty after fifty
nouns of deliberation of murder in the
second degree. The maximum penalty
is life imprisonment,, while the mini
mum is ten years.

BERKELEY, April 7. â With -death
stalking about his lowly bedside and
lingering over his every breath.
George \V. Tuthill waited through the
early hours of this morning: for some
one to answer his signal for succor.
The signal was a red flag and he had
hung it out of his window so that hla
friends might see it. The minutes
and the hours passed, but no one
came, for It was early morningr and.
people were not up then. Still th<Â»
flag fluttered unseen and at last death,
impatient,. seized its prey.
The dead man's friends ,were -.Mr.

Benvenue avenue. He. had been sick
for a long time, with none but them,
to give him help. It had tfeen ar
ranged that when he wished to see*
them quickly he should hang a red
flag out of his window. When Mr.
Thompson saw the flag this mornln?..
her shed to his friend's relief, but tha
victim of disease was dead.

Miss Isabel Irving Will Open
the New Plavhouse on
The stage is said to be a model. It
is very spacious, and consists of a brick
building entirely separate from the the
ater. There are walls two feet thick
between the auditorium and the s-tage,
while the proscenium opening will be
protected by an asbestos curtain which
has been proven absolutely non-inflam
mable.
Every preventive appliance known to
fire departments has been supplied in
this house. In addition to the big stand
pipes connected with the city's fire
mains there are sets of automatic
sprinklers all over the stage, which
fuse at a very low degree of heat and
deluge all beneath with a shower of
water. One of these automatic sprink
lers fused only recently In a printing
establishment, when a barrel of ben
rlne exploded, and extinguished the
flames before the alarm could be turned
In. They ard regarded as the best ever
made. In addition to the sprinklers
there Is an automatic skylight over, the
greater part of the etage roof which
opens both automatically and from
many places on the stage as well.
The. new theater, which has been
built under the personal direction of
its manager. H. W. Bishop, who was
formerly manager of the Grand Opera
house and Is now the manager of Oak
land's fine new playhouse Ye Liberty,
will be absolutely Independent In pol
icy. Mr. Bishop has refused stead
fastly to ally himself with either of
the big theatrical syndicates; he will
book all his attractions himself, and
will make it a poJnt.ta.see that only
the very best enter this house. \
In addition to playing all of the at
tractions booked through the independ
ent movement In New York, Mr. Bishop
will have many others of the best com
panies In the country.. â¢
Following Miss Irving's- engagement
her manager. James K. Hackett, the
brilliant . young actor-manager, will
come to the house for a run of six'
weeks, making his first appearance in
this city in many years. Following
Mr. Hackett, James Neill will occupy
the house for the greater part of the
summer.
The gallery has two entrances. One
from the main stairway and another
from a sepur.-te entrance on Ninth
street. In addition to all these en
trances and exits, there are outside
stairways of ironwork, which run from
separate entrances on each floor separ
ately to the street. In other words
each floor has its own fire escape, di
rect to the street, without connection
with any other part of the house.
The builders insist that the- fire es
capes could never be called into use.
for the house could not be set aflre, let
alone catch fire in ordinary ways. The
walls of the building are of brick and
stone. The plaster and stucco work is
fastened to lathing made of fine steel
wire; there is no wood used anywhere.
The stair -ays are of iron, or at least
the framework is. while the steps are
made from the new patent fireproof
cement called "petro-pulp." ; -">>Â«
The floors of the house are all made
of cement foundations, covered with
"petro pulp." The seats are fastened
directly to this, so that no wood is used
even on the floors of the house. The
boxes and railings of the theater are
either of metal or stucco work.
NEW STAGE A MODEL ONE.
BUILDING IS FIIIEPROOF.
The entrance to the first balcony is
from a mezzanine foyer, opening: on
three short flights of stairs, which run
into the very center of the first bal
cony. In addition to these methods of
entrance, there are -stairways on either
side of the balcony, opening on the
main stairway of the theater.
The entire house is absolutely fire
proof and not a stick of wood has been
used in the construction of the build-
Ing. The seating arrangements arc
said to -be the best of any showhouse
In the country and, in fact, nothing has
been left undone to make the new
palace of amusement comfortable and
convenient in every respect.
The Majestic Theater will be for
mally opened on April IS, when Miss
Isabel Irving will present Winston
Churchill's masterpiece. "The Crisis."
Everything points to a big demonstra
tion on that night and society will turn
cut In force to witness the initial per
formance In San Francisco's new high
class playhouse.
The Majestic has been In course of
construction for the last two years and
is pronounced by experts one of the
finest playhouses in the land. Its main
entrance will be on Market street.
ISAHEI, IRVING. THE TALEKTED
ACTKESS WHO WILL. OPEN THE
MAJESTIC THEATER.
There is a great to-do and a hurryins
of the politicians in Alameda, Contra
Costa and Solano 'counties,; -and, all be
cause there has come from Washington
complete verification of Th^ Call's ex
clusive story that Congressman Victor.
H. Metcalf is to- succeed' Postmaster
General Payne In the Cabinet of Presi
dent Roosevelt. Aspirants to succeed
Metcalf in Congress are, already in the
field. v '--:*:Â£."&Â£
Certain it is that Postmaster General
Payne i? a very sick man and vjil re
tire from the Cabinet as soon as he can
do so. Certain it Is that Congressman
Victor H. Metcalf Is I considered In
Washington as available Cabinet : ma
terial, and he almost became Secretary
of the Interior about a year ago. Cer
tain it is that President Hooseylittfhaa
had a desire for :i Paci3c" Coast man
among his advisers, and. Congressman
Metcalf stands well with the President.
Now comes the statement from some ;.f
Mr. . Metcalf s close friends that the
Congressman from Oakland will suc
ceed Payne. .
Up to this time there has not been a
candidate to announce himself for Con
gress against Mr. Metcalf; but the '.au
thority of the before mentioned inside
story was accepted so generally to
day that various possibilities began to
look to their guns. The three Stats
Senators from Alameda â¢ County have
ambitions In that directionâ G. R. Lu
kens, J. R. Know-land and F. W. Leav-
Itt. They seem to think that the chances
of Metcalf's entering the Cabinet are
so good .that, they , are J out looking
around so that they may be ready to
meet the emergency. Then, Senator
Charles - M.'. Belehaw of Contra Costa
and Lieutenant Governor Alden Anaer
son both feel themselves qualified to
fill Metcalf's shoes, and they are try
ing to learn how they can secure the
nomination, with ALameda County an
overwhelming majority In' the Congres
sional convention. '. ' .- ,
It Is â¢ pointed out that such an
appointment .would be' an Ideal one
for Congressman Metcalf and for the
politicians of the State at large. It is
acknowledged that Congresman Met
calf has an ambition to enter the United
States 'Senate, the only point at issue
being whether he will be a candidate
next spring or four years from now,
when Senator Perkins' term expires.
Should he enter the Cabinet now he
would ha\ - e four years to serve. This
would make his candidacy just right at
the end of the present term of Senator
Perkins. It . would also clear the pres
ent Senatorial sky.
The insurance men present consti
tute the committee on fire and water
of the . Board of Fire Underwriters.
They are Charles D. Haven, who pre
sided; Rolla V. Watt, secretary of the
joint committee; Rudolph Herold Jr.
and Edward Brown.
Prominent insurance men of San [
! Francisco conferred yesterday after- ,
j noon with the Board of Fire Oommis- ,
I sioners and Assistant Chief Dougherty ;
j of the Fire Department. As a result it ;
] was decided to appoint a committee .
: to ascertain all the facts about the
] cost of a proposed salt water plant for
j the city, the committee to be empow- \
I ered to secure engineering skill from '
! the Board of Works. It was also de- '
I termined to bring before the Fire Com- j
; missioners at their next meeting a;
! plan for the extension of the fire Hm- ;
I its of the city by running a line 137Vi '
} feet north of the north side of Pine
I street and 137*4 feet west of Liarkin ,
' street: also to include in the fire Hm- j
: its the block bounded by Steuart, East!
j Folsom and Howard streets and the \
j block fronting on the east line of Pow- |
j ell, street, between Broadway and Pa- |
} cific street. Those present also put j
j themselves on record as favoring Chief '
! Sullivan's claim that no frame building-,
.'shall be erected in this city, either j
within or outside of the fire limits,
more than three stories in height. |
While the discussion over the salt |
water plant was going on nearly all !
those present took part. It was soon- 1
! apparent, as was acknowledged by the
speakers, that no one had yet secured (
j conclusive figures, either 'concerning
! the cost of construction of anypartic
j ular sort of i>lant or relating to the
j engineering features of the enterprise.
In view of this, it wa^s decided to fol
low Davy Crockett's motto and to first
be sure of being right before going
ahead. Commissioner Boyne promised
to interview the Board of Works at
once- about getting an engineer. The'
â¢next meeting of the Joint conference
between the insurance men and the
fire officials and department officials
will take place on the call of the chair.
Commissioner Boyne expressed the
opinion that the Olympic Salt Water
i Company could pump up enough water
j to reservoirs to be created on the
heights of Twin Peaks to serve" as a I
supply for the city in time of emer
gency. H. W. Westphal was present
| to tell about the capacity for pumping
salt water that Is possessed by the^
j Merchants' Ice and Cold Storage Com- i
! pany. All the members of the Board '
1 of Fire Commissioners were present j
and made suggestions. Assistant |
Chief Dougherty favored the plan pro- j
pogÂ£d by Fire Chief Sullivan* for a j
great salt water storage plant on Twin j
Peaks. !

One of the most interesting phases of
Russia's military activity in the pres
ent war with Japan Is the construction
of a railway across the frozen waters
of Lake Baikal for the purpose of
transporting troops, a railway upon
ice is not -a novelty in Russia. For
example, says the Pall Mall Gazette,
the return of winter and the freezing
of the Neva finds St. Petersburg pos
sessed of an ice railway, which fills the
place of , the suspended steamboat ser
vice, while the Volga at certain points
is crossed in similar fashion during the
winter months. An ice railway con
sists of somewhat lighter rails than
those used oh land and the rails are
pinned . to very long sleepers (twenty
feet being the length generally adopted)
in order that the weight may be dis
tributed over a wide surface. "A rough
estimate of the cost of laying this type
of railway. Is $176 per mile.
I However, the Neva, Volga and other
ice railways are only small "affairs in
regard to length, compared with that
which has just been opened for traffic
upon j the "unfathomable, waters" of
Lake Baikal. The latter starts from the
riverside station of Baranchikl, on the
Irkutsk shore, and terminates at the
Mlssovala station of the 'Trans-Baikal
section. . The steamer* route between
these points. , is forty miles long, but
the line makes a wide sweep in order
to avoid. the broken'surface of ice left
by the lea-breaking steamers and to al
low the line being used as an auxiliary
means of transit; when the steamers
begin running again; but. the Ice is still
of sufficient thickness to bear the rail
way. . -

To appreciate the force of sub
aqueous convulsions that produce tidal
waves it Is illuminating to remember
through what an enormous bulk of
water the energy is transmitted. The
Pacific Ocean covers 68,000,000 miles
and has a weight of water computed at I
948,000,000,000,000.000,000 tons; the I
Atlantic is spread over 30,000,000
miles and weighs 326,000,006,000,
000,000 tons. Atlantic waves of 600 feet
in length and between forty and fifty
feet in height have a velocity of fifty
to fifty-five feet per second. Who
. will be bold enough to figure out the
amount of energy exerted by an earth- j
quake which sends the whole abyss
of ocean into convulsions, drives the
storm waves high inland upon the '
West Indies and shifts the -balance of j
the remotest loch In Scotland? It
brings the problem nearer to mind,
perhaps, to reflect that a shock strong
enough to agitate all the seas and i
oceans would set in motion a body of
water which would cover the whole
globe to a depth of two milesâ were
it not for the houses in between.
Also, It helps to know that to the 323,
800,000 cubic miles of water comprised
in the whole ocean all the storms and
deluges of the worst years contribute \
but 6500 cubic miles. â St. James Ga

The United States sloop of war Cum
berland, carrying twenty-four guns
and 370 men, was the first vessel to
Join issue with the Confederate iron
clad Merrimac In Hampton Roads,
March 8, 1862. In the battle, one of the
most notable in naval history, the Mer
rimac rammed the Cumberland, and as
the latter drifted in sinking condition
fired broadside after broadside at
close range until the decks of the
Union vessel were like a slaughter
pen.
And yet the men fought on. When
the lower batteries were flooded the
gunners ran to the upper batteries and
kept up the fight. To the demand of
the Merrimac to surender v the officer
in ' command answered, "Never. I
will sink alongside." and with flag
flying and guns firing the Cumberland
went down.
There was controversy as to who
made- this answer, as to who fought
the Cumberland, and Commander Wil
liam P. Randall. U. S. N.. retired, who
was on the vessel at the time, wrote
out his recollection of occurrences, on
condition that the paper should not be
published until after his death. Com
mander Randall died recently, and his'
version of who fought the Cumberland
has just been published. Of .the fight
Commander Randall says:
"Lieutenant George Upham Morris
was in command, but all hands fought
her, every man on board of her. The
ship was sinking when the Merrimac
hailed us to surender, and Morris,
turning to me, said: 'She's a slaugh
ter penâ a slaughter penâ but I can't
haul down the colors.' My reply was:
'Let her go with her colors fly
' Ingâ she's sinking now.' Stepping to !
! the starboard gangway Morris an
swered the Merrlmac's hall In these
words: J No, damn you. I will never
surrender.' At this time the Cumber
land quarterdeck \vas r a fearful sight,
for It was red with 'blood, and the
â¢' dead outnumbered the living. All the

"Ninety-five per cent of all vocal
teachers are quacks," said an old
"musician. Few singers, would doubt the
assertion. Probably in no other kind of
work can a man who knows practic
ally nothing about a subject do so
quickly a lucrative amount of teach
ing. There are many common types:
the piano teacher who cannot get
enough pupils to make a living; the
broken down; old time singer, the der
elict of the concert halls who never
could sing himself, but who now
gives fifty or more lessons a week at
from three to five dollars each, and
many more. Their half hour lessons
may be said to consist one-third of
chat and gossip, one-third of scales
; and exercises, and one-third of the
singing of the pupil's favorite songs,
all interspersed with just enough
commendation and criticism to keep
the pupil's good opinion of both her
self and 1 her teacher. There are, teach
ers who make their pupils sing at a
brass-headed tack in the wall, and
there are others whose training: has
not only ruined voices but tempo
rarily harmed general health as well.
Over -against these Â¦ charlatans of the
profession there are conscientious men
and women, who can detect faults in
a voice and know how to correct them,
who are a constant inspiration to the
student's musicianship and who work
carefully and enthusiastically for each
individual pupil.
It Is not easy to tell the. good teach
er from the quack, and you will find
bitter early experiences in many a
successful singer's career. â Leslie's

THE coming celebration at Modesto, to commem
orate the destruction of the bonds that so long
. : were a burden of debt will have for one of its
leading features a great set of games by the San
Joaquin Valley . Academic League. 'There will be other
features of interest, day and night r reworks, military
maneuvers, barbecue, speeches and songs, the participa
tion of Governor Pardee, a banquet, etc.; but where 'the
shouts will be the loudest and where the excitement
will be the most keen and where the largest \following
will be is dependent upon the boys and their field day.
â¢ The Modesto Herald says that the' high schools of Fres
no, Sanger, Easton, Madera, Merced, Oakdale and Mo
desto will be represented" at the time 'of general rejoic
ing. The visiting delegations. from the high schools will
be attended by numbers of their elders â grown-up boys
and grown-up girlsâ their fathers and mothers, whose
pulses have : not grown too old to tingle when their
brave lads battle to victory or as valorously go down in
defeat when the glory of school and home are at stake.
The sagacious managers of the irrigation jubilee, at
Modesto have seen that the lads will draw a crowd, and
prizes have been offered, for which the 'several high
school teams will lustily compete. While the other
events at Modesto may receive more newspaper space in
the reports, business considerations commanding a
greater share of attention on an occasion that is dis
tinctively to celebrate a fiscal transaction, what is done
and what is said at the "field day" will be, longer re
membered by the boys who" see and participate than
will any other happening of the jubilee.
Room for the boy! It is well that his muscles should
be strengthened, that his pluck should be stimulated
and tried by competition, that he should learn to lose as
chivalrously as he wins. Room for the boy of the San
Joaquin Valley! An empire in extent is his heritage.' All
the energy that he now stores up, all the steadiness
that he now acquires in stress of emergency, will find
fitting use. Around him spread countless broad acres
that will be the home, some day, of millions. Its fruitful
soil and balmy atmosphere contain, hidden but not un
suspected, the basis of food supplies so varied that a
prince could ask for little that cannot in the great val
ley be' produced. The snowy mountain peaks that daily
present themselves majestically to his admiring gaze,
shimmering on his horizon, are rich with minerals so
vast in value that they are' literally said to have been
hardly scratched over. Their slopes are seamed with the
currents of mountain streams that give life to verdure,
in the summer months and contain power enough to
move all the wheels of industry for an empire.
Room for the San Joaquin Valley boy! Â¦ The eyes of
fond mothers and of fond fathers are on the young
Olympian.. The State of California looks to him to.be
upright, self-respecting, energetic, loyal, fun-loving, a
good American, a good Californian, a firm believer in
the great valley in which he thrives. When the bugles
blare and the drums beat 'and the people cheer for their
emancipation from bonded indebtedness, still the com
mon thought, deeply cherished, is for the future of the
boy. In sports, the day will be his. In significance, it
has, no less immediate kiterest to him, as it is the future
arbiter of the destinies of the valley. Next to the San
Joaquin Valley girl he is the best and most cherished
product of all.

conversation ceases and attorneys,
court officials and visitors rise while
the crier sjovyiy announces: 'The hon

sociate Justices of the Supreme Court
of the United States.' Robed in black
silk gowns, they walk with slow and
dignified steps toward the bench, and
as the Chief Justice appears at the en
trance at the rear they slowly proceed
to their seats. As they do the crier
cries: 'Oyez! oyez! oyez! All persons
having business before the honorable
the Chief Justice and the Associate
Justices of the Supreme Court of the
United States are admonished to draw
near and give their attention, for the
court is now sitting. God save the
Government of the United- States and
this honorable court.' It is an impos
ing and inspiring spectacle, the mere
witness of which Increases the red
corpuscles of one's patriotism. No man
entering that domelike courtroom may

The recent accident off Guantanamo
In which the battleships Missouri and
Illinois collided seriously damaging the
latter ship has been inquired Into by
a board of naval officers. The board
finds the accident due primarily to the
B'.eerlng gear of the Missouri breaking
down, and that the subsequent efforts
made by the commanding officers failed
to prevent the Missouri from ramming
the Illinois. Both captains are praised
and further proceedings are not recom
mended. Admiral Dewey and Secre
tary Moody approve of the board's
recommendations, but the President is
said to be desirous of convening a
court-martial in order to fix the re
sponsibility. The failure of the Mis
souri's steering gear Is the latest but
tot unusual occurrence of the kind.
The Illinois ran aground in the harbor
of Christianla, Norway. July 14, 1302,
because the steering gear broke down,
and similar defects have developed In
the Indiana and Massachusetts. All
these ships are fitted with a combined
steam and hand steering gear, but the
latter has either been found equally
useless or else proper expedition has
rot been exercised In utilizing the hand
steering gear when the steam gear be
came disabled.
The number of court-martials in the
British navy for 1901-02 was so small
as to make a very creditable showing.
The number tried was 321 out of a
total force of about 105,000, and of the
CIO offenses charged 500 were against
discipline. There were no cas*s of
murder, perjury or forgery, but there
were 101 cases of theft and embezzle
ment. One hundred and seventy-two
charges were made for striking or at
tempting to strike an officer, sixty-two
for behaving with contempt against an
officer and sixty-two for conduct pre
judicial to good order and naval dis
cipline. The corresponding figures for
court-martials and offenses in the
United States navy for 1901-02 have not
been published in detail, but the total
number of offenses was 660, with a
total force of less than 30.000. which in
creased to 1008 during 1902-03.
The work of raising the sunken sub- i

to place the boat in dock at Portsmouth
for $12,500. The first attempt failed, a
two and a half inch hawser snapping I
in the effort to cant the boat into an
upright position, and all depends upon
the state of the weather. In this con
nection it is curious to note that the j
wrecking company, with its usual fore
sight and enterprise, had put in at
Portsmouth a week before when it
heard of the maneuvers that were to
take place, so as to be ready if any
thing in their line turned up. As it
happened the cervices were wanted,
for the Admiralty has no salvage ap
pliances of its own, depending solely
upon private enterprises of that sort,
snd the contracts usually go to the
Swedish company or to a well-known
Italian wrecking concern. Another
curious coincidence is this, that the
diver who first went down to locate
the sunken submarine Is the same man
who two years ago went down twenty j

It is now announced that the experi
ments have been conducted largely
with the Idea of the early application
of the system to the railroad â¢onnect-
Ine Berlin with Hamburg, distant by
rail 176 miles from each other, and that
an early conversion of that line is by
no means Improbable. Somehow the
hundred - mile - an - hour train- looks
nearer than it did a few months ago,
and our spy-glass is still trained in
the direction of Germany. * .
We note with pleasure that our
space-devouring friends at Zossen have
not yet satiated their hunger for pace,
and touched the record the other day
for no less than 140 miles per hour,
says the Street Railway Journal. They
seem to be overcoming air pressure
rather eomfortabJy up to the present,
and wÂ« have heard nothing about the
motors failing or the pressure caving
in the front end of the car.
Perhaps the doubting gentlemen who
figured on the motors burning out from
overload at 80 to 100 miles per hour will
now be convinced that higher speeds
are 5>oth possible and practicable. One
hundred and forty miles per hour is a
decidedly hot pace, but it will more
than likely be beaten before we go to
press. It has taken a good many years
to evolve the two-minute trotting
horse, but this year we have him in
triplicate, and just so it has been with
electric railroading. Once the records
began to break they fairly flew up, aifd
left only small fragments.
One hundred and forty miles per hour,
even if not outdone by a considerable
margin, still means that the hundred
mile-an-hour train is much nearer to
reality than It has ever been before.
That speed is quite feasible whenever
it is demanded, and it is, moreover,
quite high enough to meet all require
ments of humanity for some little time
to come. Its real importance lies, as
we have often remarked, in its appli
cation to long lines on which the saving
of time would be material. Cutting
down the running time to Flatbush or
Hackensack may defer the dyspepsia
of the commuter for another season or
two, but it is not commercially import
ant. It is cutting the time on long runs
that counts â reducing the time to
Washington to less than three hours,
and converting the trip to Chicago into
a mere night's run.
Scientific Notes.
THE conviction of Senator Burton of Kansas of the
crime of bribe taking, and his fine and sentence
to imprisonment, carrying deprivation of civil
rights, is an event deplorable in its effects upon him per
sonally and also in its public aspect. He claimed to be
merely acting as attorney for a company that by reason
of the character of its business was liable to exclusion
from the use of the .mails. The allegation against hirii
is that he appeared before the postal authorities to pro
cure the vacation of the exclusion order. In so doing, he
violated the Jaw which' obligates him as a member ..of
Congress. The law under, which he was , convicted has
enly recently been called to public attention by the in
dictment, prosecution and acquittal of Senator Dietrich
of Nebraska. . . '."*..
Formerly such acts as those charged against these
Senators were not unlawful, and were freely indulged
in by members of Congress. When the operations of
the Government were in much less volume than "now,
and when Federal legislation touched an infinitely less
number of private interests, a of Congress had
his status as attorney or agent unchanged by his elec
tion. There is in existence a letter from Daniel Web
ster, in which the divine Daniel offered for a percentage
to get through Congress a large claim against the Gov
ernment, while he was a Senator of the United States.
Such practicesÂ»were common in his time, and did not in
any way impair the moral standing of a member of Con
gress who indulged in them. When States or individuals
had claims against the Federal Government, Representa
tives and Senators acted as agents and attorneys for the
claimants and used their influence and position to get
bills passed making appropriations to pay their
clients.
The first change from this system appeared in 1861.
The Federal. Government was not prepared to make all
the immediate expenditure or use of its credit to carry
on the Civil War. In this emergency Congress. passed an
act authorizing States to spend money in enlisting, arm
ing and equipping troops, and pledging the Federal
Government to repay such outlays, upon submission of
proof, thereof, the money to be paid, in the^ case of each
State, "to the Governor or his authorized agents." This
lifted from members of Congress the burden and took
from them the reward of pressing such claims, and by
Federal law established a State agency for that purpose.
Under that law, these claims, the largest ever pre
sented against the United Stages, have been proved up
by the, agents of States, who received such compensa
tion by way of percentage therefor as the States agreed
to give. The New England States have just .collected
interest on that class of claims, their agent being Mr.
Fessenden, who has just collected his percentage fee of
25 per cent, amounting to a large sum. We believe
every State has made such collections except California,
which is still out of pocket about $3,000,000, though the
State agents long ago made the necessary proofs ac
ceptable to the War Department.
Following the principle of this law of i86r, in 1864
Congress passed an act making it a ; crime for a member
of Congress to have any interest in any claim, contract
or matter to which the Federal Government is a partv in
interest, involving money. This is the statute under
which Senator Burton has been convicted. It was also
the cause of the investigation of Congressman Littauer,
because gloves manufactured in his factory were sold to
the Government, and of the conviction of the Demo
cratic Congressman, from Brooklyn, who was more di
rectly involved in Government contracts.
It was the basis of the report of the Ppstofnce Depart
ment showing the number of members of Congress who
were involved in contracts for the lease of their prop
erty to the Government for postoffice purposes. In all
of this class of cases it was shown that the leases were
made before the lessors were elected to Congress, and
the interesting question was raised, whether a lease,
profitable to the Government, could be voided by elec
tion of the lessor to the House or Senate. This question
has not gone to the courts for decision, but the Depart
ment .of Justice construed it favorably to the Govern
ment's interest as lessee.
The cases arising under this statute are used as a
text for preachment upon the decadence of public
morals. But is it so? Does it not rather prove that the
statute of 1864 evidences a higher sensibility and a stand
a'rd of morals superior to the conditions that preceded
it? What Webster and numbers of his contemporaries
did or offered to do, with no sense of its immorality,
now is cause for penal sentence and loss of civil rights.
They did not recognize such acts as mala in se, wrong
in themselves and immoral. The statute ranked them
with the rrAala prohibita, wrong because prohibited, and
the public conscience has now come to- recognize them
as morally wrong. This means a better condition than
that which existed "in the brave days of old."
contends that such a law \vouid inter
fere with the prompt delivery of sup
plies for vessels on foreign stations
and, furthermore, â¢ that it would add an
expense of about $800,000 a year to the
present cost of shipping coal under the
Navy Department. The board believes
a subsidy for development of
American shipping would serve better,
or J.hat payment of wages to a naval
reserve and naval militia serving on
American ships would largely defray
the expense of maintenance and would
not burden the army and navy with
the Increased cost of transportation pf
supplies.
He was listing heavily to port as he
wobbled up Third street on the night
of the Britt-Corbett fight." There was
nothing in his appearance to indicate
that he could purchase even standing
room at the rear entrance to Wood
ward's Pavilion, but he was full of
enthusiasmâ and other things. He
halted at the corner of Mission street,
then he landed against the counter of
a cigar store Just as if he had been
looking for such a place. While in
his restful position he made use of a
few question?:
"Fight over?"
"No," said the cigar man. "They're
just about going on."
"What time is it?"
"Nine-thirty."
"Well.. I will! Shay, first thing I
know zhish liquor business will keep
me from seein' that fight."
And then he staggered away toward
the yelling crowds that stood before
the bulletin boards. There he saw the
Nearly Missed It.
The worth of the speeches is the worth of the man him
self. What : - Lodge only implies in his estimate of the
character of the speeches of President Roosevelt should
be accentuated by. iteration and reiteration,. and that is
the utter fearlessness of their tenor.; Roosevelt has
never hesitated to speak' his mind on the subject' of any
national question even though he may be certain that
his hearers are not in 'sympathy with his views and that
their expression may be impolitic from a politician's
viewpoint.- Some have found fault with the Chief Exec
utive upon this point and called his outspoken vigor the
temerity of youth and the lack of diplomatic finesse,
even those fearful ones have begun to see that
Roosevelt's word and Roosevelt's deed are one; that
practice follows preachment with as "undiplomatic" a
vigor. â¢ . , .
This collection of Roosevelt's speeches and-state pa
pers has more significance than any biographical en
deavor or laudatory brochure. By it the American
voter may read and gather his own opinion of the fit
ness of the man now directing the state. These written
and spoken words of the President form an epitome of
the political history of the United States for the last
three years. Â»'</;:, Â¦ . ' /

8I the greatest floral fetes ever held here.
The raid made on the realm of Flora
j during the past week was evidenced
by the wealth of flowers presented in
! the procession., These trophies had been
i worked into magnificent decorations
| for floats, carriages and automobiles.
j and proudly the ladies exhibited their
! work to the admiring multitudes that
lined the streets of the city. That the
! Woman's Club knows how to conduct
a floral show without the aid of man
was demonstrated, and to-night all
the visitors are declaring the event
v.as a grand success. Xo nicer day
could have been selected for a floral
fete. Besides the parade and entertain
ment furnished this afternoon, the
orchards for miles and miles around
San Jose are in full bloom, and these
flowering fruits were a show in them
selves.
Not only did San Jose give its own
people and the visitors a floral fete,
but 't wa3 practically a parade of the
best society. The most popular
matrons and the prettiest buds were
in line. The sole direction of the af
fair was in the hands of the Woman's
Club, and a young worrfan. Miss Dora
Farnswnrth. acted as grand marshal.
So confident were the women of con
ducting the parade successfully that
they did not Â«i\en Invite a squad of po
lice to head the procession.
Business was almost suspended. It
is estimated that there were nearly
10.000 visitors in the city to-day. A
few hundred of these have been here
fer the past few days awaiting the fes
tival, and the balance came this morn
ing. The early trains fnÂ±m San Fran
cisco and Oakland and other bay
points brought large crowds, and from
all over Santa Clara County the people
turned out.
The Woman's Club entertained its
fruests at the handsome clubhouse of
the St, Claire Club, on Second and St.
James streets, opposite the St. James
Park. The club had turned Its home
over to the ladies, and the place had
been handsomely decorated. Here open
house was kept this afternoon and
.Â¦evening. Many prominent club women
cf San Francisco and other places
called.

Third Assistant Grand Chief Stevens
says in his petition that at the Norfolk,
Va., convention in 1902.it was decided
to hold the next biennial meeting at
Los Angeles. Preparations by the local
subdivisions in that-district were ac
cordingly commenced for the event and
are now well under way. -Some time
ago. however, the petition continues,
the central officers- of the brotherhood
sent out circulars to all the subdivi
sions in the United States, Canada and
Mexico, saying they had experienced
great difficulties in making plans for
the Los Angeles convention and that it
was /deemed advisable to change the
meeting place' to Cleveland, where bet
ter facilities could be secured.
Grand Secretary Ingraham of the
brotherhood said this? afternoon that
while there had been some talk of hold
ing the convention at ' some point in
the Middle "West as . a , result " of the
extreme cost of transportation' to Los
"Angeles,, the officers at no time had
definitely decided on such .a step. 'He
added that, as a ; matter of fact, the
delegates would get reduced rates on
account of the ; Methodist general con
ference to be held at Los Angeles, com
mencing -May 5, and that? as- a result
the brotherhood 'convention will doubt
less j be held in that ; city as originally
planned..

tlon in Cleveland or any other point
aside from Los Angeles. The latter
city was originally chosen as the place
for holding, this year's convention, but
owing to the high transportation rates
a movement was recently j started to
hold the convention, which meets May
11,. in this city. :-'\ '

Had to Throw Kennedy Out.
Judge Lawlor granted a writ of
habeas corpus yesterday morning for
the release of William B. Kennedy,
alias Richard Jackson, alias "Yellow,"
charged with the murder of Policeman
Eugene C. Robinson on January 21,
1902. The release was because no one

thrown into the waiting arms of Tay
lor, who took him to the prison and
again booked him for murder.

NEW YOflK, April 7.â In an excit
ing chase after a highwayman who
had snatched a young woman's pocket
book at Thirty-fourth street and Sec
ond avenue to-day, two men were
shot, one being probably fatally in
jured. The man, who gave his name
as John Kenny, grabbed the woman's
pocketbook ftnd knocked her down
when she struggled to retain it. He
then tried to escape on a moving car.
Joseph Corn, 26 years old, overtook
Kenny at the. corner of Third avenue
and Thirty-fourth street and clinchea
with him. In the struggle Kenny fired
two shots, one striking Corn in the
arm and the other in the abdomen.
Kenny then jumped up and ran.
E. B. Johnson Jr. of Woodside, L. I.,
next overtook .the fleeing man, and
jumped on his back, carrying him to
the ground, with Johnson on top.
Kenny still held the revolver in his
hand, and pressed its muzzle close
against Johnson's face and fired. The
bullet passed through Johnson's jaw.
Before Kenny could fire again a police
man grasped the revolver. By this
time several hundred persons had
gathered around the struggling men,
and cried loudly that he be lynched.
Other policemen appeared^ and Kenny,
who was bleeding from a blow on the
head, was hurriedly taken to the po
lice station. ?'\T-i' :

Mrs. Augusta Towle, 225 Mason
street, has been wooed by Cornellu3
J. Murphy, ex-Deputy County Clerk,
for some time, but recently he has
been too strenuous in his wooing and
was told to cease his visits. Mrs.
Towle secured a warrant from Police
Judge Conlan yesterday for his arrest
on a charge of battery. She alleges
that a few days ago he called while
drunk and knocked her down and on
Wednesday he again called and
amused himself by slashing the carpet
ln her hallway with a knife. She
wanted warrants for threats against
life, malicious mischief, disturbing the
peace and battery, but the clerk issued
only the one warrant.
Mnrpiiy Is a Strenuous Wooer.
Long, who is only 18 years of age,
disappeared after the stabbing and the
pojtce are searching for him. Stewart
is 29 years of age and unmarried.
Tlobert - Stewart was seriously
stabbed by Louis Long at the factory
of the Tubbs Cordage Company, Po
trero, yesterday morning. They had
beeif working on the same* machine for
some months and often had quarreled.
Yesterday morning a belt broke and
Stewart accused Long of causing the
break. Long denied it and called
Stewart vile names. Stewart struck
him and Long grabbed hold of a knife
with a four-inch blade and stabbed
Stewart twice with it.
Stewart was taken to the Potrero
Emergency Hospital, where Dr. W. E.
Buell found that the blade had en
tered the neck, going upward to the
base of the brain. There was another
wound about two inches from the
right side of the spinal column, the
blade severing a rib. The wounds
were stitched and dressed and Stewart
was able to go to his home at 11 36 A
Alabama street with his brother.

Rube Smith has been matched to
fight Kid Williams at Stockton on the
18th inst. Itufe Turner declined a
match with the Denver man.
If this fails Greggains will match
Canole and "Battling" Nelson. The
latter defeated Spider Welch recently.
Joe Walcott dropped into town last
night from Boston, thinking he was
matched to fight Billy Woods before
the Shasta Club this month. Woods
did , not come up to expectations at
Colma on Tuesday night and the
match was sidetracked. Walcott
seems to have had his trip for noth
ing, unless he can take on the Dixie
Kid at Colma or Oakland.
Frankie Neil has at last been of
fered a big match in this city. Alex
Greggafns wants him to meet Abe
Attell here next month. Attell wired
yesterday that he would fight at 118
pounds at 3 o'clock. Neil will decide
to-day.
The colored fighters are beginning
to have their innings. For this month
the new Shasta Athletic Club will
present the big colored heavy-^veights
In the persons of Jack Johnson and
Sam McVey. Johnson left Chicago
last evening for this city, while Mc-
Vey will remain a few days longer in
Oxnard, where he has been quietly
training in anticipation of a second
meeting with the colored heavy
weight champion. The last time the
two met was in Los Angeles in Octo
ber, when they drew the largest house
ever gathered to see a fight in the
City of Angels. On that occasion
Johnson won a decision from the Ox
nard fighter in twenty rounds. The
contest will take place in Mechanics'
Pavilion.
The San Francisco Athletic Club
was granted a permit for a profes
sional contest in May. Representa
tives of seven clubs agreed to donate
1250 to the mother of Frank McCon
nell, the boxer, who was injured- some
months since.
The issues between the Boxers'
Union and the fight promoters will be
discussed at a meeting to-morrow
night. Both sides are tirm and the
game may have to be discontinued for
a time.
The Supervisors' Police Committee
look no Tlotice of the unsavory con
dition of the sport at its meeting yes
terday. It granted the Lincoln Club
a permit for the 15th inst. and the
Hayes Valley Club one for the 22d
It was thought the expose of the
true inwardness of the so-called
"amateur" boxing made at the Bay
City Athletic Club show on Wednes
day night would open the eyes of the
Supervisors to the violations of the
city ordinance governing boxing.

of the older divisions. The dogs will

order:
Seattle Bats Gray, the Ix>s Angeles
IMtohcr, All Over the
J**ield.
LOS ANGELES. April 7. â A slower
and duller game than that between
Seattle and Los Angeles this afternoon
<ould hardly be imagined. Seattle
batted Gray all over the field, from the
start, but it can be said In Justice to
Oray that his support was poor. Most
Â«if the locals and some of the visitors
played without the usual snap and
energy that has marked their work in
previous games. Barber pitched a
*trtong game 'and kept the hits well
scattered. Flood's home run was
about the only feature of the cham
pions* playing. Score:

He had hardly accomplished this feat
when Buck Francks shot a smoky one
along the third base line. Peter and
the doctor came in quickly. Then Ham
tried to throw a snake shoot, and in
stead of hitting the catcher's mitt *he
hall went through to the backstop and
"Janley took advantage of the delay by
scooting in.
But Mr. B. IVvcroaux hooked a fast
â¢me at Francis, too hot to handle. Then
l*ncle Peter drove the leather out to
left p.nd Moskiman got a base on balls.
Mr. Ganley got in right with the Oak
land fans when he tore off a bingler to
loft that chased Devereaux in.
Dr. Moskiman kept throwing up un
derhanded ones till the last man was
out. That was all he had. but it was a
sood assortment. Five timesthe Port
landers connected with the shoots, but
never often enough to bring in runs.
Then the M. D. was steady-all the time
and only one man walked.
Poor Hani Iberg got his in the fifth
spasm. Up to that time he wasthrow
ing fast ones, and slow ones and they
vere all good. The Oaklanders could
not get jerry to the kind Ham had. So
when Clancy hit to left field in the fifth
rnd Streib immediately doubled him up
â¢lth a hot one to Beck, it looked good
for Portland fer a few more rounds
at least.
If Portland could only have made a
few runs yesterday it might have been
a long talc of how Dr. Moskiman was
walloped and walloped and then sent
back to the bench. But Portland would
rot do such a thing. In fact, the stars
Â«â¢Â£ the north acted like gentlemen and
refused to hit the ball outside the dia
mond. On several occasions they re
fused to hit it at all. Score: Oakland,
A: Portland. 0.

Joe Jones, the clever little New York
rider, piloted two winnes. Joe is alert
at the post and will soon be in tho
front"rank.
C. H. Pettingill. associate judge at
Oakland, and who fills a like position
on all of the New York tracks, jeavea
for the East this morning. The vet
eran racing official's presence is re
quired at Aqueduct track, which opens
on the loth inst., compelling him to
curtail his stay here.
George . Rose, who has been booking
at ; Los Angeles all winter, intends
dropping up this way and will prob
ably cut in at Oakland to-morrow.
Jack Atkin, a good winner at Los
Angeles with the chalk and chamois,
arrived here yesterday.
Jed Lewis, one of the stars at th<i
Southern California meeting, attired in
a long, light "Benny" that was the
envy of "Big Bill" Knapp, Sammy
Greenfield and Joe Jones, piloted
Handpress to Victory in the fifth. And,
by the way, there is a dispute over
the services of Lewis and the judges
at, Oakland will make all of his en
gagements until the matter is settled.
It is claimed that the contract held
on the boy's services by J. L. Ellerd
allows the latter to take, half of the
rider's earnings, which Is a breach of
the racing rules.
Romaine, winner of the second event,
was bid up from $400 to $1000 by Char
ley McCafferty. Murray & Co. retain
ed the gelding.
ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
Billy Magrane's Handpress, with Jed
Lewis in the saddle, was installed a 2Vi
to 1 favorite, for the seven-furlong
selling affair following. Later in the
betting Marelio, Possart and Montana
Peeress were all well supported and
the price about Handpress stretched to
5. The little horse had the requisite
supply of speed and, leading from start
to finish, ran in three lengths ahead of
Marelio. Montana Peeress lost the
show to Possart.
Kitty Kelly paraded in front of her
company all the way in the last, a mile
and seventy yard selling fixture, at
odds of 4 J ,Â£ to 1. Mocorito, the favorite,
trailed her throughout, losing out by a
length at the wire. Reed finished third
with IOU.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Last Monday Bonner rode Reeves in
a Futurity course run when the La
masney horse was one of the favorites,
and his lethargic exhibition was the
laughing stock of the track. In the
second event yesterday, a seven-fur
long selling number. Reeves, ridden by
Roach and 10 to 1 in the ring, ran. a
smashing race, being beaten but a neck
by Romaine after a hard drive. The
winner was played down from 6 to
4%. Aunt Polly, the favorite, with
Knapp in the saddle, led almost to the
stretch and then blew up. Flaneur
never got close to the firing line and
Sheehan's handling of David S bordered
on the sublime.
Riesca, now racing In the colors of
T. McLaughlin, captured the six-fur
long number following. Puss In Boots
had first call in the betting and led al
most to the stretch. Then Joe Jones,
astride Riesca, assumed the front posi
tion and, ridden out, the filly downed
Resigned more than two lengths.
Both Bright Moon and Harry Beck,
favorite arid second choice, respective
ly, for the mile and a sixteenth selling
run, were unable to get any portion of
the purse. Hellas, a 20 to 1 outsider,
made all the running, only to be led out
a neck by Blessed Damozel, an 8 to 1
chance, with Reed up. Gold Finder ran
third. Harry Beck was possibly short,
finishing fourth.
HAXDPRESS A WINNER.
. The programme at Oakland yesterday
was composed entirely erf selling events,
and favorites did not, shine to any
particular advantage, Rowena being
the lone winner. No big surprises were
sprung, however, for most of the dif
ferent successful horses were accorded
more or less support. The weather was
warm and there was a' large attend
ance.
Rowena, the Burns & Waterhouse
filly, again made a favorite for the
introductory sprint, showed to more
advantage than at her first essay. Rid
den by little Joe Jones, she quickly,
showed in the lead and was. not headed
anjj part of it. Jean Gravler, with
Haack in the saddle and 15 to 1, beat
the poorly ridden Solinus for place
honors. Powell, on the latter, got away
well, fell far back and then came with
an ill timed rush when too late. -

now: before Congress to acquire a

the present sense of the Turlock board
that until additional fact3are presented
it cannot assent to anything looking
to the passage of the. reservoir sites on
the Tuolumne River into the control of
any private or special interest and

When the case of the United States
vs. W. J. Dasha,' T.' J. Dempsey,
Thomas T. Burnett and Lee LIm .was
called for .trial yesterday in the United
Shates District Court Dasha and
Dempsey entered pleas of guilty and
were ordered to appear for sentence, on
Saturday morning. y â¢
The indictment .charges the defend
ants with having entered into a con
spiracy to' land Chinese illegally into
the. United States. The trial, of Lee
LIm was postponed until April 15 on
account of the absence-of- Samuel M.
Shortridge, counsel for the defendant.
This is the last of the celebrated
substitution cases, in. which four white
men have been disgraced and which
caused Deputy United States Marshal
William P. Gamble to commit suicide.
Dasha, Dempsey and Horn' Toon were
convicted, of conspiracy on the first In
dictment; Dasha and Dempsey pleaded
guilty to the second and third indict
ments and Wong Din was convicted on
the second indictment. .The prosecution
granted a separate trial to Burnett on
each of the three indictments, but a
nolle prosequi will be entered as to
him, for it is conceded that without his
testimony convictions might not have
been obtained. .
The maximum penalty on each charge
of conspiracy is two years imprison
ment in the State penitentiary and a
fine of $10,000. As there is some doubt
whether the indictments do not refer
toÂ» one and the same conspiracy, it is
unlikely that the full penalty will be
exacted. A sentence of six months im
prisonment, in the County Jail was all
that was imposed by Judge de Haven
upon Wong Din for substituting Ma

Commissioner of Works Woodward
and Assistant City Engineer Marser
held a conference yesterday regarding
the claims for damages filed by owners
of property in the vicinity of streets on
Parnassus Heights and other localities,
the grades of which have been ordered
to be changed by formal resolution.
The two officials named agreed that
{he existing ordinance, based on the
provisions of the charter requiring
damages to be assessed and paid by
those benefiting by the change before
the actual improvement is commenced,
should be repealed, or at least modi
fied, as it works a hardship.
As it is now the grade change is only
ordered on paper and yet damage
claims must be paid before the damage
has really been done.
Woodward stated that the ordinance
is absurd because, though the gra3e
changes are officially ordered, they
may not be carried out for five or ten
years and perhaps not at all He
instanced one case in point of a prop
erty owner who filed a damage claim
of $4000 on account^of certain grade
changes recommended by the Board of
Works and ordered by the Board of
Supervisors.
"This man. under the law, must be
paid the 54000." he said. "Now, should
it be determined to carry on the actual
change of grade at some future time,
together with the sewering and paving
of the street, this man could, according
to the law, refuse to pay for his share
of the work because the cost is In ex
cess of half the value of his property.
The need of amending the ordinance Â«s
apparent."

he indulges in a copious outpouring of

At the expiration of his twelve
months' Imprisonment in this city
Michael Johnson, who enslaved his
young wife, is likely to be escorted
to Oakland and tried on a felony charge
there. A transcript of the testimony
which secured his conviction before
Judge Mogan is now being made, and
it will be sent to the District Attorney
of Alameda County with certain state
ments marked for the guidance of that
official. Among other things of. which
he will be asked to take cognizance is
the wife's assertion that Johnson placed
her in an immoral house in Oakland
and was supported by her earnings
therein. The man dwelt on this 'side
of the bay, but as that particular act
of his generally infamous treatment of
his wife was committed in Oakland he
cannot be tried for it here.
Johnson is now under a six .months'
sentence for carrying concealed weap
ons, and Judge Mogan will probably
place him under a 55000 bond to keep
the peace. If he fails to find good and
sufficient sureties for that amount he
must spend an additional half wear in
jail.
William Moore, charged with as
saulting Mrs. Rose Coyne in her dwell
ing on Tehama street, was held by
Judge Mogan in 52000 bonds to answer
before the Superior Court.
For cpnducting a lottery place at 927

"Hush!" commanded the bailiff. "Let

It!" shouted the Judge. But the din
continued until the bench stuffed Its
ears with index fingers and yelled:
"Ten dollars apiece for contempt of
court, and I'll keep piling on 510 a sec
ond until this uproar subsides!"
The subsidence was Instantaneous
and complete. Without further pro
test the unhappy thirteen paid their $20
apiece in silence and crept away on

who fought with fists only,, and when
two policemen butted .into the conflict
the I atmosphere was animate with
hurtling glass receptacles of beer and
other beverages. Out of the confused
heap of combatants the officers man
aged to extract Edward Kenny, Cas
tigllo Gognozio and Louis Orlando, and
the trio were arraigned before Judge
Mogan for disturbing the peace. When
it was explained that the /battle was
started by Signor Orlando maliciously
throwing a bottle at one of his com
patriots and through faulty marks
manship maiming an American em
ploye of th*.. Union Iron Works., the
court dismissed Kenny and fined the
two children of Italia $5 apiece.
In a racial war at Fourth and,Keaf

: "You quelled the clamor by taking

Mr. Pettit reluctantly admitted that
such had been his practice. Then he
Vas remanded for further investiga
tion.
"The policeman says you were selling
some kind of a scissors sharpening de
vice," remarked the Judge.
"Ah! that's where the officer was
mistaken. I don't sell the sharpener,
but simply demonstrate its use with a
view to advertising it. It's a 'most re
markable Invention. You see, it
sharpens"â â
"Never . mind about that," was the
judicial interruption. "The officer
says you offered to sell and did sell the
sharpeners for 15 cents apiece. Is that
true?"
"William Pettit, a dapper little man,
with gray hair and mustache, declared
In presence of Judge Mogan that hi3
arrest at Market and Second streets
was an outrage because he was neither
hawking without a license nor ob
structing the thoroughfare:
"The officers have not eonvinced-me
that you Were guilty of playing craps,
but from w^hat they, have said about
your performance on the piano I think
they would have been justified in ar
resting you for disturbing the peace."
After hearing the policemen's testir
mony and patiently listening to a most
labored defense in behalf of each in
dividual defendant Judge Cabanis3
fined Green and Edward 55 apiece and
dismissed "Nervy Bill" and Pianist
Nunn. Then to the latter person he
said:
At the pianoforte presided a gentle
man named George Nunn, and out of
the instrument he thumped a series of
sounds which a mind attuned to music
might possibly interpret as "Bedelia"
In quickstep time and with weird varia
tions. From a rear apartment were oc
casionally wafted such exclamations
a? "Come, eleben!" "Li'l Joe!" "Oxford
ties fo' my baby!" "Cross de ribber fo'
mo* money!" and other phrases per
taining to the technique of craps, in
terspersed â¢ with sharp detonations
created by pressing thumb against mid
dle finger and then suddenly releasing
the pressure with sliding motion. It
needed only optical corroboratlon to
warrant the" disguised sleuths to act,
and that they obtained by suddenly
dashing into the back room. There
they saw James Green and Edward
Mouton "chucking the bones." Arrest
of. Green, Edward, "Nervy Bill" and
Virtuoso Nunn.
The officers told of how. they had re
ceived a tip that the seductive "come
seven" was a favorite pastime of
"Nervy Bill's" patrons, and of how they
acted in accordance with that informa
tion. Attiring themselves in plain
garments they sauntered Into, thf:
saloon with the air of men upon whose
hands time was hanging very heavily,
and one of them yawningly proposed
to the other that they indulge in a
game of freeze-out for drinks. Never
suspecting the identity of his visitors
"Nervy Bill" gave them a pack of cards
and a boxful of celluloid disks and
with customary politeness escorted
them to a baize-covered table. Then?
they sat, seemingly oblivious of their
environment, but really with ears and
eyes alive to everything that was done
or said around them.
"Nervy Bill's Exchange," at 212
Townsend street, is much frequented
by certain colored gentlemen employed
to the dining and sleeping car service
of the Southern Pacific Company while
they are off duty. ' They favor the
place with their presence because its
proprietor is an Afro-American of ex
cellent business and social standing
and because he personally sees .to it
that their visits are made as pleasant
as possible. For their entertainment
he maintains a piano with that peculiar
tinpanny tone which gives such charm
to the playing of ragtime, and he has
card tables with all the appurtenances
thereto essential to freeze-out or crib

PROF. LIVINGSTONES readings are like
a living page of Flammarlon's treatises that
is so electrifying the world to-day. HE IS
NO IMITATOR. His work Is upon original
lines; PURE THOUGHT. CLEAK â¢ VISION.
He TELLS YOU WHAT YOU DESIRK TO
KNOW, AND WORKS IN THE OPEN
LIGHT, AND IS AS CONSPICUOUS FOR
ITS -WONDERFUL- OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR ITS ORIGINAL EXPRESSION
AND VIVID TRUTHFULNESS.
.iA'test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. V LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test is
of little value when the mind is troubled â
you need more substantial aid and advice.
This is just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on him for a first-
class clairvoyant reading.. He asks yAu no
questions, but tells you what, you wish to
know. : :
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with tho facts in your case. Let- PROF. I
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
; troubling you, find the, cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

COMMERCIAL NEWS
The Lamorna's fate is no longer in
doubt. The British ship, which sailed
from Puget Sound March 1 for
Queenstown, was wrecked. Her shat
tered remains strew the waters of Bar
clay Sov/nd and the chaff from her
carj;o of. wheat is scattered along the
beach for miles. Incidentally, the lo
cal speculators, who refused to accept
the previously reported findings of
wreckage as evidence of the vessel's
being lost and backed their faith in
her safety with hard cash, lose more
than 520,000 by her destruction.
The confirmation of the Lamorna's
loss was taken to Victoria yesterday
by the officers of the steamer Tees.
They report Barclay Sound full of the
wreckage of the missing ship. They
identified portions of the deck boats,
the hardwood lumber of which the
deckhouses had been constructed,
about twenty hatches, spars and yards.
They also report that the chaff from
her wheat cargo had drifted ashore,
clearly establishing the fact that the
Lamorna had been utterly demolished.
The Lamorna was a vessel of 2159
tons register and wm commanded by
Captain Crichton. She left Tacoma
March ]. After her departure a ter
rific southeaster swept the coast. Some
days later it was reported that a. boat
marked "Lamorna" had washed
ashore on the Vancouver Island coast.
Other wreckage was found, among one
batch a package of letters belonging to
the Lamorna's mate. With the finding
of the first wreckage the underwriters
reinsured their risk and as each subse
quent find was reported the rate of re
insurance advanced until It reached
90 per cent.
The steam schooner AlHance picked
up one of the Lamorna's boats far to
the southward of where the wreckage
had been found and the rate dropped
to 75 per cent.
- In spite of al! the wreckage found
the high rate offered tempting odds to
the local speculators and nearly every
man that ever plays "overdues"
bought Lamorna "to arrive."
In all more than $20,000 of local
money was invested on the fate of the
wrecked vessel. It is thought that
she sustained serious damage in the
southeaster, but survived it and got
to the southward of where the Alliance
picked up her boat. .In clearing the
wreckage this boat was probably
thrown overboard. Captain Crichton
later, it is thought, decided to return
and was sailing back to Puget Sound
when disaster overtook his ship and
all on board. It was known that the
Lamorna steered badly, and, being
damaged in the southeaster, probably
became unmanageable in a subsequent
blow and was driven on the rocks of
the Vancouver' coast.
Â»
Russian . Barkentine Overdue.
The Russian barkcntlne Bering, which left
Yokohama sixty-nine days ago for this port,
has not yet Arrived, and fears are expressed
for her safety. It Is possible that she may
have fallen a prize to the Japanese navy. The
Bering is a steel vessel of 377 tons register and
thÂ« only vessel flying the Russian Jlajr that lÂ»
familiar at this port. She Is owned by the
Kamtchatka Commercial Industrial Company
of St. Petersburg. Roth, Blum & Co. are her
agents at this port.

Confirms Loss of Kaflua.
The steamer Tees, which arrived yesterday
at Victoria, brought confirmation of the loss
of the schooner Kailua and reports the ves
sel's deck ashore thirty miles from where her
bull Is stranded.

The physicians recently appointed by
the Board of Health to make daily In
spections of the general health of the
children and teachers In all the public
schools of the city met last night with
the members of the Board of Health
and the School Directors in the City
Hall. After outlining plans for the
medical examination of the children* in
the schools, it' was decided to ' drop
from the rolls all teachers suffering
from defective eyesight or hearing.
Dr. Ward, president of the Health
Board, said:
It is a pleasure for me to say that the pres
ent Board of Health does not represent a politi
cal body, and, while it is most grateful to
Mayor Schmitz for the - unstinted confidence
that he " has rested . with it, it is . bound
by no creed other than the upbuilding of a
stronger city and a better community through
the introduction of wholesome and modern san
itary ideas. We believe that you will under
take and perform your part in the creation of
a. better San Francisco through the various
means suggested for school inspection, which
ultimately will lead to a larger and healthier
community.
Duties of the inspector commence with the
time ot his daily visit to the school. Usually
ho Is expected to make h's morning visit be
tween 9 and 10. thus giving the teacher the
time to note those who appear to be 111 and
have them ready for the medical examiner
when he arrives. A partial or complete diag
nosis may be made of the various cases, but
unless/the disease is clearly of an infectious or
contagious character, it is usually advisable to
send the child home, with the advice to the
parent that it requires medical attention. In
case the disease is infectious or contagious tba
child should be sent home immediately.
In case of doubt (diphtheria) a culture
should be taken, and in addition to notifying
the parent the proper health officers should
also be advised promptly, either by postal, as
seems to be the method mostly In use, or bet
ter by telephone. Under such circumstances,
if several cases are found he should visit thÂ«
several classrooms in the school building, pay
ing special attention to the one from which tba
suspected case or cases originated, and exam
ine every pupil, making cultures from those
who present any evidence of sore throat.
Children with tuberculosis w^ll not be
permitted in any school in this city and
county. A special corps of specialists,
under the direction of Dr. Louis Dean,
will look after eyes, ears and noses of
the children. Where a child is sent
home, blanks, signed by the inspecting
physician, telling the cause or probable
cause of the sickness, will accompany
the little one. If a child is absent from
school the teacher will inquire the
cause of the sickness and report the
same to the inspecting physician. f
President Roncovieri of the Board of
Education was "present and informed
the members that the Board of
Education was thankful for the assist
ance to be rendered it and stated
it would assist the physicians in
every way. The work of inspection will
begin next Monday.
SALT LAKE. Utah, April 7.â The
action of the General Conference of
the Mormon church yesterday in de
claring all who may take plural wives
Â¦will be liable to excommunication and
will not be protected in any way has
given many prominent Mormons vis
ions of the penitentiary-
The action of President Joseph F.
Smith in forcing this action came as
an unpleasant surprise to those who
had recently entered into new plural
marriages, supposing the authorities
would wink at it, much less punish
such a step. President Smith declared
on the stand in Washington that he
still believed polygamy to be divine,
although he 'denied the practice was
continued. The polygamists felt mora
secure than ever. Now If President
Smith and the other church authori
ties stand by the -principles affirmed
yesterday they. must help to produce
evidence in polygamy cases and they
must punish ecclesiastically whera
there is proof of guilt.
It is regarded as highly doubtful
that the church will take the* initiative
in any such matters, but if seemingly
conclusive evidence of polygamy Is
produced before the Senate Committee
on Privileges and Elections, now hear
ing the Smoot case, showing that cer
tain persons have contracted plural
marriages since the- Woodruff mani
festo against It, the belief is the
church authorities can hare no other
recourse except to excommunicate the
culprit. According to the Mormon be
lief excommunication would cut off all
hope of going to heaven, but that does
not worry the polygamists so much as
the prospect of going to the peni
tentiaryl
There are some cases which thÂ»
Senate committee is already preparing
to investigate and the principals are
frightened. Subpenas have, been is
sued for Angus M. Cannon and for
Lillian Hamlin Cannon. Mrs. Cannon
is alleged to have been polygamously
married successively to three of Can
non's sons. David and Abraham H.
are dead, but the third, now living,
has departed suddenly for Canada.
Apostle John W. Taylor, M. F. Cow
ley and George Teaadale, all accused
of having taken plural wives since the
manifesto and all wanted by the Sen
ate committee, together with other
witnesses in the same case, are on
the underground. Elder S. S. New
ton, another polygamist, has also dis-r
appeared, so has J. M. Tanner, Sun
day-school leader. It is expected that
others, some of them of prominence,
will do likewise until the general in
terest dies away. : V:

NEW YORK, April 7. â There were signs of
Etalcnes* in the market's upward movement to
day and the action of prices became decidedly
irregular during the day. This might have
been even more marked had it not been for the
stror.g sustaining influence of the persistent up
ward movement of United States Steel pre
ferred and the enormous absorption of the sec
ond mortgage bonds, which made the backbone
of the whole market. The auxiliary ]K>lnts of
strength were few and were not among the
stocks of the first importance. The most Im
portant stocks were inclined to hang back and
showed the effects of realizing on their recent
advance. In Fj-lte of some items of news that
miprht have helped their advance. Among thone.
â¢UÂ« eood statement of February net earnings
by all the railroads in the so-called Harriman
group, including Union Pacific and Southern
Pacific. The weather map and the crop hews '
continued favorable to the Southwestern grain
carriers, but Missouri Pacific, Wabash pre
ferred. Rock Island and Atchleon preferred
were the only Mocks 10 ret-pond to an appre
ciable extent. The strength of the Steel se
curities was attributed to consideration of the
quarterly report. Amalgamated Copper shared
moderately in the strength of the metal stocks.
The takings of United .States " Steel second ;
mortgage bonds were Â» Urged to be of an invest- '
ment character, and improvement was reported
in the bond market generally and In demand
for t-ome hlsh era !Â¦â¢ investment railroad stocks
preferred stocks Included. The extreme ease of
money ik a natural incentive to this kind of
buying. Honey was loaned over the end of the
year to-day at as low a* 4 4 per cent per an
num, which makf-s the holding of many well
cecured railroad stocks and bonds attractive;
The outward movement of *old in thetie cir
cumstances causes little uneaoiness. Yester
day's arrival at pan Francisco of $3,500,000 In
Japanese gold indicate*, how the outward drain
is made up at other points. The heavy con
traction In loans by the banks of England and
France reported to-day indicates the reflux
tendency In those money markets, following the
quarterly settlements, and gives small promise
of any immediate demand for monej-. London
wÂ»s a buyer of Mocks here this morning and
helped the early advance.- Only in Ecattered
instances did the rise tn stocks reach as much
ns a point, snd the activity of the market was
much curtailed in the latter part of the day.

"The Rio and Fantoe crop on the trees now
ebout beln*r harvested |g estimated at 10 000
t<0O to lfi.ftoO.OOO bags. The 1904-5 receipt* of
mild Coffees, tn accordance with the best ob
tainable information, will be 3.500.000 to 4 -
(â¢rto.ooo ba*s. The coming crop of Victorias
and liahias In estimated at 500.000 bags.
Therefore, the estimates of the world's pro
duction for 1904-5 aggregate 14.000,000 to 15,
0O0.000 bags, which are to supply a pros
pective conaumptlon of about lfl.500.O0O baps.
We confess that crop estimates at this time of
the year are not a Â«afe guide, but we cannot
l(tnoÂ»Â« them at the present time entirely be
cause the indications are Â«trotur!y pointing- to
much smaller crops than w e have had in re
cert years."
"The receipts of milds In Europe and the
r I. nite<J s-:,t.v during the next three montlis
will probably amount to about 1.400.000 1-ats.
of which only about 850,000 bags will bÂ»
needed /or consumption; Â«o that the ftockH of
UMÂ«e in Euroj* and the United States will
rnt*t likely incrÂ»-as* about 450 000 bags dur
ing that period.
"The jrenrral statistical position of Coffee
will undoubtedly rhow a considerable Im
provement during; the next threÂ«> months and
we do -not htFitate to state that we believe
I that there will be a decrease i n I.e visible
supply of (he world of about 1 350 000 hzgr
during that period. We calculate the total
into-Blght movement of all Coffws during th*
next three months et about 2.400 000 bars
while the usual requirements of Europe and
thÂ«. t.'nited states during that period are about
3.750.000 bare Uhe rtellveri.* in Europ*- and the
Vnlted states during thÂ«*e three months laft
>ear were 3.5Â»no,WXI baps). Thin in itwlf Is
<>' first Importance, but when we consider that
the bulk of the consumption (about 75 prr
cÂ«ntÂ» la at Brazil Coffee, the condition presents
1'wlf to us that In a few months from now
*uch lira*:! Coffees as are renerally wanted
by the trade will be most difficult to obtain
"Buying of late hae Tx-en of good character,
and it appear* that declines cannot be brought
ebout any more with the ease which accom
panied such endeavors until a short lime ago
The confidence of those who are Interested on
the long wide of Coffee contract* Is based not
only on the prospective improvement in thtÂ»
statistical position within the next few month*
but on the belief In the continuation of such
improvement for a long time to come.
_ "Of course the stook* at Rio and Santos are
I to be considered in this connection. These
*toÂ«~ks amount to sriout 1.750,000 bags but
Judging by the way the Brazilian markets.' have
acted during the last two months, having be^n
continually '^c to 140 a pound above our
rarity, we must conclude that very little of
thÂ»> stoeV.s in Rio and Hantos <-an be obtained
by consuming markets unless buyers grant the
view<. or the holder*:
Â¦Tti<! vifibie supply in the fnited States
Â«J| Breril Coffee including afloats. is about
2.!>OO,CWX) bars. On the Kurface this hÂ»?ks m
if there was a big oversupply of stocks Jn this
country; l>ut when we examine the character
and grade of Mine, we find that outside of
th* holdings of the large roasting interests.
th- largest part consists of such grades and
â¢jualities whi-~h wne no other purpose than
for delivery Â«urÂ»inf=t Ooffee Exchanee" con
tracts. The BUpply of such grades as the
trade requires, that is. from 4s to Kt, has be
come redu'-ed to such an extent as to be In
sufficient f<Ji' U^ual requirements.
GENERAL STATISTICAL IX.1SITION
The circular of Henry Nordlinprr & Co.,
New York, says under date of April 1:
"Our market is slowly and gradually devel
Â» oping a healthier tone. The highly specula
tive eKmf.nt. which has been euch a disturb
ing factor in the recent past, has been entirely
*hminated. Nevertheless, confidence . has net
been quite fully restored a* yet. It has boon
kept in the background through manipulation
by old experienced hands who have bÂ«vn mak
ing supreme efforts to depress the market still
further; but these- efforts have not met with
success. The market is virtually unchanged
from a month ago. The steadier undertone has
brought about some improvement in the trade
demand. Price* are certainly inviting, and
when the pressure to keep the market down is
once removed, we expect to Â«eÂ« the legitimate
demand t>roadeninÂ«r because the trade inland
is very poorly eupplicd.
"We stated in our report of the lft ultimo
that the receipts at Rio and Pantos for the
remainder of the crop year will be al>out rÂ»o
per cent a> compared with last year. .The
March recclpu Indicate the correctness of our.
calculation, inasmuch as they were less than
400.000 baÂ«rs. against 801.000 baps last y<-ar.
â¢The average consumption of Brazil Coffee in
Europe and the I'nited States, at. thU period
of the year it about 950.0W bags per month.
Last month only about 4<Â«>.0CO bags Rio and
.Suntoe Coffee, and about :SO.OU<> bag* -Victoria
and Bahla cent into eight: therefore the visi
ble supply of Brazil Coffee must have -de
creased more than OOO.OoO bag* during that
month. We hRvc now before tm three months
in which the receipts at Rio and Santos will
kw- exceptionally i>m&ll, not more than about
300.000 t>ags average per month, a total of
J*f"O.GOO rp*rs. and of Victorias and BahUs
about lOo.OOO hags, total Brazilian receipts
l.(ioo, 000 bag#. Â«^;i;i,-! requirements for con
sumption of about 2.^00.000 bags of these kinds
during that period.

A N*w York banker eays:
The money market continues eaey because
"uf'.ness and speculative requirements are less
g*gÂ«8t than formerly. Neither the April set
"nienta eor the prospect of gold experts had
-:-> appreciable effect upon rates. Some com
n Â»-r:t was made upon loans passing the bil-
M mark for the first time and the prospect
t diminish*^ bank reÂ«*rveÂ«; but even theÂ»e
?'iorÂ» created no uneasiness In banking dr
-:Â«Â¦Â«. for the reason that the present high
..or* in loans Is largely due to the borrow
r.jes of iitrong corporations, who find It more
Â¦1\antagrous to raise necessary funds In th'.s
hfcbloa than to lsÂ«ue new uecurity Issue.* whon
u;u>f are low. London has been more friend
â¢ jo American atocks; but no Fpeclal foreign
'upport can be counted upon until It is known
p*Â«t thr war will bring forth. Russia has
b**n sounding Paris, end Jai>an London for
Â«ar loans and the terms do not peera to
have been' satisfactory. Very likely both
Â¦runtrles will have to meet bankers' views
Inter tÂ«n. for war loans are cow a practical
certainty."

Higher cables and favorable ' weather were
early factor* in the wheat market diametric-,
ally opposed to each other. As a result prices
held comparatively steady during the early
part of the session. Initial quotations on July*
were unchanged to }4c higher at 30%t?87c. For
on hour there was little change In quotations,
but suddenly sentiment became bearish, with
prices declining rapidly. Weakness. In coarse
grains Induced a whirlwind of 'liberal selling
by commission houses and pit traders. With
only a relatively small demand,. July sold off
to 80%c. Later- in the day a trader who was
a conspicuous figure In the corn pit became an
active purchaser of wheat, presumably with
the object of indirectly forcing up the price
of coarse grain in order, to creato a better mar
ket upon which to throw a lot of his long
corn. Tho Northwest was also a fair pur
chaser, led on by a suggestion oÂ£p a postpone
ment in seeding operations. â¢ Sensational rt

in weather conditions In that section, I
and much lower temperature supplanting all at

sequence wns a quick rally In prices. . ' Many I
of -thÂ«' early short seller* were forced to cover

"The formal resolution of the carmen,
relating to students 'breaking in,' asks
that the future employment of men in
excess of the legitimate requirements
of the servlce.be suspended during the
pendency of negotiations, and 'the pres
ident of the union was directed to re
quest the United Railroads to discon
tinue breaking in. men in excess of the
normal requirements of the service'
and 'in case of a refusal to notify the
company that members would refuse to
break In any more men.'^
, r "Neither this resolution nor any
thing ,likfÂ»; it was ever delivered to any
officer of the company, which was
flatly .told 'the resolution didn't mat
ter; that all students now breaking: in
must be withdrawn by noon". to-day.'
In ' other' words, at noon j that day they,
the Carmen's Union, would cease to
break; men in. : This unfriendlvÂ» ulti
matum was outside : of their instruc

union, so far as we know.; , All con

were simply tossed to one side. ,
"It "must- be distinctly borne In mind
that the increase given by, the arbiters

Chapman, "and, therefore, it was will

General Manager Chapman in an in

LOS ANGELES, April 7.â At the
scheduled minute the palatial train
bearing 110 members of the California
Promotion Committee on their tour of
inspection of the southern end of the
State, arrived here this morning. Such
a large number of prominent men of
the north have not been here in a body
since the famous Pardee special
brought the Republican host to this
city to deliver the championship banner
to this county by reason of the big vote
which was cast here for the Republican
ticket. That was a political mission
and this is an educational and social
one.
The men of the north will remain in
this end of the State until Saturday,
and if there is lacking anything which
would tend to make them feel welcome
it will not be the fault of the various
citie^ which they, will visit. Special
cars met the 'train and conveyed the
visitors to breakfast at the Westmin
ster and back to the train again. At
the hotel the travelers were welcomed
by a committee of local citizens ap
pointed to accompany them on the re-
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
i The happy effect of this concession
! was at once seen in the disappearance
j of strike talk wherever the men gath
ered to discuss the outlook. The news
spread with great rapidity, as it always
does in times of labor difficulties among
street railway employes, and the men
seemed tote in a much less belligerent
mood when questioned by passengers
on their cars. In almost every case the
grlpmen and conductors expressed the
hope that a strike may be avoided, al
though, with a few exceptions, they de
clared that the only way this could be
done was by further concessions from
the company. The conditions most
generally Insisted upon.were'the "flat"
rate of 27^ cents an hour, the employ
ment of only union men and the dis
continuance of the importation of East
ern "strike-breakers." Other matters
in great number are at issue between
the union and the company, but the
men in general are not concerning
themselves greatly about these. They
are, however, enthusiastic in their de
termination to stand by .their union
and its Official representatives..
At yesterday morning's meeting be
tween Chapman and the union officers,
it was agreed that the detailed discus
sion of the demands' of. the men should
begin forthwith. Accordingly at p.' m.
Cornelius and Bowling, with sev
eral other union representatives, went
down to the United Railroads offices in
the Kialto building, where they spent
the entire afternoon in conference with
STRIKE TALK SUBSIDES.
The tirst real step toward an amica
ble settlement was taken - *yeaterday
morning, when President Cornelius and
Secretary Bowling, representing the
Carmen's Union, were closeted for sev
eral hours with Manager Chapman in
the offices of the company. After this
meeting Cornelius said that the man
ager had made an important conces
sion that would remove, temporarily,
at least,. one of the worst grievances of
the union men. Pending the discussion
of the points at issue, no more new
men were - to be put on the cars to" be
"broken in." This statement was later
confirmed by the company's officials
and the number of "students" was not
increased on any of the lines.
There is a truce in the street railway
sltuatioh.\ In a conference between the
officials of the United Railroads and
the representatives of the Â¦ employes'
union yesterday the matters of differ
ence .were taken up for discussion. This
conference will be resumed this morn
ing and perhaps may last several days.
Both sides last evening professed to re
gard the situation as promising a satis
factory , adjustment of the difficulties
and the avoidance of a strike.

The police are making an investiga
tion Into the cause of Henry Gohring
er'e death, although the presumption
Is that It tvas from natural causes. He
lived at 549 Howard street and was
n. locksmith. Yesterday morning he
was found unconscious on the porch of
a lodging-house at 781 Broadway and
was seat In the patrol wagon to the j
Harbor Emergency Hospital, where he
died about 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon.
Detective Bailey ascertained that
Gohringer had a holiday on Wednes
day and he went to a wine shop at
604 Broadway, which he used to fre
quent while he lived at 791 Broadway,
and drank there all day and night.
Karly yesterday morning some of the
men who were arinkinp with him,
thinking: he still lived at 75! Broadway.
led him there and left hir- on the front
jiorch. He was so much under the
influence of liquor that he was unable
to talk to them.
It was at first thought that he might
have got a dose Â«if "knockout drops,"
but as he had only $2 with him when
he went to the wine shop and there
remained 53 cents in his pockets when
his clothing was searched at the hos
pital that theory was dispelled, as there
could he no motive. The body was re
moved to the Morgue, and Captain
Martin left instructions that the stom
jich be sent to the city chemist for
sr.alysis.
Gohringer was the complaining wit
r.Â«?ss against Joseph Davis, who was
sentenced by Judge Dunno last Satur
day to serve four years in San Qucn
tin on a charge of assault to rob. Goh
rinfrer was going home, drunk, on the
morning of October 4, and Davis and
tw<Â» others forÂ«-ed him into "a doorway
p.i Third and Mission streets and after
throw-re him down attempted to rob
him.
