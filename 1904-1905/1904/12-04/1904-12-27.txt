PORTLAND, Or.. Dec. 26.â Because
cf the number of fatal accidents to
trains bearing the unlucky number 13,
orders have been Issued on the moun
tain division of the Oregon Railroad
and Navigation Company which strike
that number from the train sheet. The
tragic death of Conductor Charles F.
Brown at Kamela In November was
the climax.
The last train order sighed by Con
ductor Brown on that fatal trip was
order No. 13, which he received at
Bingham Springs and which, in his
asual Jovial manner, he at first refused
to sign for, telling the dispatcher to
change the number. After a few
Joking words over the wires with the
dispatcher Conductor Brown took the
order and in delivering a copy of it
:o Engineer Peter Theisen said in fun:
. ."That's a bad one. Pete. Look at
the number and then look out."
It was the last order Brown re
ceived. It being a "meet order" on

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Dec.
26. ; â It is now considered certain that
the woman who ; was /-murdered on
Mount Cutler, near, this city, and whose
body was found on" December 17, was
Mrs. Bessie Bouton, daughter of, Mr.
and. Mrs. Charles R. Kempter of Syra
cuse, N. Y., and sister of Mrs. Charles
R. Nelson of Santa Barabara, Cal.,
whom she visited in August* Every
bit of description of Mrs. Bouton's ap
pearance received thus far corresponds
with, that of the dead woman. The
dental work was described by Mr. and
Mrs. Kempter as nearly as lay minds
could describe it. Mrs. Nelson is com
ing to Colorado Springs" and if she
identifies the teeth'' and the dental
work, all doubt wilf" have been re
moved. -â¢'-
Mrs. Bouton traveled for Dr. J. Park

Charles Zobrlst, a druggist, to whom
she tried to sell a bill of goods, re
members her, also that a stockily built
man was with her when she called
upon him on one occasion.
Mrs. Bouton wrote -to her parents
from this city and said she would be
at' home on Christmas. . She has not
been heard of since that time. â¢ It is
claimed she had made arrangements to
sue her husband for a divorce," her mar
ried life having been unhappy, and that
she had engaged a Denver attorney.
Her parents. do not implicate Bouton in
her death, but suspect a man named
Gambler, salesman for a barb wire
firm. He is more than six feet tall,
while the man described by Zobrist was
short. However, the latter recalls im
pressions only and his description is not
exact. â¢
Thus far a motive sufficient to ex
plain the crime is lacking. Mrs. Bou
ton wore jewels valued at more than
$1000, and carried several hundred dol
lars in cash, yet the officers do not be
lieve that a robber would have tried
to cremate the body, or have carried all
her clothing away. The crime suggests
degeneracy and flendishness.
SANTA BARBARA,, Dec. 26.â
When Mrs. Charles R. Nelson of. this
city read the description of the dental
work in the teeth of the Mount Cutler
victim, the nature of the gold fillings
and the bridging being quite out of the
ordinary, she. concluded at once that
the dead .woman was her sister, Mrs.
Bessie Bouton. Other circumstances
supported V this conclusion, she said,
Mrs. Bouton having left Santa Barbara
last August ; for Los . Angeles, going
thence to Denver. It is said she trav
eled in company -with a traveling sales
man, who is - said \ to . have given her
several thousand dollars' worth of dia
monds. Mrs. Bouton wore the. jewels
; conspicuously. while. in Santa Barbara,
and her sister believes the murder was
committed to get possession of .the
jewels. Mrs. Nelson declares she knows
nothing of . the whereabouts of Mrs.
Bouton's husband. . . ,

Special Dispatch to Ths Call
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 28.â Rev. Dr.
Ingraham N. W. Irvine, whose friends
have lodged a new presentment against
Episcopal Bishop Talbot of the Central
Pennsylvania Diocese, who unfrocked
the former rector, consented to-day to
tell of his old disappointments and new
hopes.
"I am only willing to speak in a gen
eral way of the features of the case,"
said Dr. Irvine, "as the new present
ment is entirely in charg j of my friends
and I will not interfere with their plan?
by talking about it. There are some
points at issue, however, upon which I
feel free to speak.
"In the first place I wish it could be
made plain that this presentment is
not an attack by me upon Bishop Tal
bot, but that it is a prosecution brought
by the church to inquire into actions
which bring'the church into discredit.
If I should- die to-night the present
ment would go on Just as well'with'riie
dead V as ''alive.' Bishop Talbot /and I
wereaJways good friends' until' trouble
arose -ElliStt â .;â  w.hllei I-Ve-as
-rectot.;jat;-Huntlngton." . â¢-: .-<
J'Did Bishop Tal'bbt visit Mrs.' Elliott
frequently?!' Dr. Irvine -was' asked.,- j
"He did, and they appeared to be
close friends," was the reply- "Why,
you know- purple is a' Bishop's color
and Mrs. Elliott used to wear purple
when the Bishop came to town."
HIS VIEW OF MRS. ELLIOTT.
"Is she a handsome woman?"
"No, not in my eyes. Beauty, how
ever, is a matter which apparently each
man sees with his own eyes and I sup
pose men will never ci*ase wondering
what some other man sees to admire in
some woman who may have been a
mutual friend."
"Is Mrs. Elliott a social leader of
Huntington?"
"No, I don't think she would' be called
that. She has many influential friends,
however, and has plenty of money, but
there are several women I should say
are more, widely known and popular
throughout the town.
"It is reported that the presentment
is based largely upon a. letter written
to Rev. Mr. Upjc-hn and that no word
of the latter has yet been made public.
"I believe that is correct. Several
bishops were referred to in that letter,
most of whom have repudiated the use
of their names as references against
me. ' - .'...-.
STUOXG LETTER TO BISHOP.
"When the wc/rding of that letter be
comes public the church will be sur
prised.' In it : I am: charged, with all
sorts of things and some of the refer
ences will .cause a sensation. Things
have s6 far been smothered. Bishop
Talbcit.at one time himself asked for
an; inquiry after the first committee, by
a close vote, had failed to present him,
but he afterward withdrew his request.
1'About^a year after I Had been de
posed. I -wrote to Bishop Talbot, ask
ing for reinstatement. Part of the let
ter read: 'You must certainly; remem
ber that I did my duty in reporting the
Elliott divorce matter to you. â¢> You cer
tainly excommunicated her, as the re
ceipts show. You- wanted me to com
promise the case with her afterward. I
could not do so. There was nothing for
me 'to do but stand my ground, under
fire -from her: Both Mrs. Elliott and
her husband had been divorced. Mr.
Elliott's 'crime was a very grievous
one. Alas, .how could either you or I
have compromised? Don't you remem
ber our signatures were given to a me

RUSSIAN CZAR SAD
TO BE INSANE.
BLOW ON HEAD WEAKENS RULER'S MIND
DAVID STARR JORDAN GIVES
OUT INFORMATION:
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 26.âDavid Starr Jordan, presi
dent of Stanford .University, who is in this city, says he has re
cently received reliable information from Russian sources to the
effect that Czar Nicholas is now thoroughly insane at times and
that permanent insanity is creeping upon him relentlessly. This
is the result of the blow upon the head received by the Emperor
Hvhile'in Japan on his tour of the world several years ago. The
blow came from a Japanese crank and was not considered serious
at the time. The people of the village where the assault was
committed have become so ashamed of the incident that they
have petitioned to have the town's name changed.
"I have learned from an authentic Russian source," said
Jordan, "that the Czar is yet suffering from the effects of the
blow he received years ago. No, I cannot tell you my inform
ant's name, for obvious reasons, but it is said to be well known
in St. Petersburg court circles that the Emperor is at times en
tirely bereft of his senses.
"Russia cannot be rated as a world power," continued
President Jordan. "It is in the hands of an hereditary associa
tion of -grand ducal grafters. It probably can never be success
fully invaded, but it is too disorganized to be powerful.
"Japan is making herself a world power, however. The
effect of this war upon the Japanese is hardly understood anyr
where. They are fighting in a manner that is full of medieval
patriotism. They forget the individual and look only toward the
; final result."

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 26.â After hav
ing made a successful flight yesterday
in , Baldwin's California "Arrow," the
airship which - was so successful at
St. Louis, A. R. Knabenshue made an
ascent to-day which almost cost him
his life and which for a time threatened
the loss of his airship. His life was
saved by a number -ol ranchers on
"Lucky" Baldwin's ranch, twenty miles
east of the city, just before the ship
was dashed violently against the moun
tains of the San Gabriel range.
A stiff gale of wind was blowing this
afternoon when Knabenshue started
his flight atthe Chutes. Soon after he
had reached an elevation of about 500
feet his motor went wrong and he jvaa
at the mercy of the gale. The wind
carried him northeast to the foothills
beyond the city and there he made a
landing. Fixing his motor he started
back, traveling at good speed in the
very teeth of the gale. His approach
was seen by hundreds of persons and
for a time it looked as if he would land
safely, i
While hovering over the starting
point preparing to descend, his motor
again failed and he was driven before
the wind and lost from view. For hours

it was not known what had become of
him. He was driven rapidly toward
the mountains. In the Monrovia dis
trict he opened his safety valve letting
gas out of the big cigar-shaped bag
until his machine was less than one
hundred feet above the earth. Some
thing then went wrong with a valve
and he was being carried rapidly
toward the mountains.
He had no anchor, so he let down all
the ropes he had. "While passing over
Baldwin's ranch he attracted the at

to them to grab the ropes. George
Cautz seized one of the ropes and held
on. He was dragged over several
barbed wire fences and his clothing
was torn from his body. Several of the
ranches seized other ropes and two of
them finally succeeded In taking a
hitch around a small tree. The rope
held and the airship was brought up
with such a jerk that it started the ma

SCENE FKOM "THE DARLING OF
THE CODS' AT THE GRAND
OPKRA-HOVSE.
hove been no "Darling of the Gods,"
that if as to its chief scene. There is
a minister of war who is a Scarpia.
There i5 a hero, a rebel against the
government, who is betrayed into his
hands. There is a heroine from whom
the Japanese Pcarpla demands honor
as the price of the hero's freedom.
And to force Yo San to comply the
minister has the hero tortured in an
adjoining chamberâ or rather cellar.
Had this ail come before "La Tosca" â
yes. But the situation becomes obvious
and unconvincing even in 'its most be
coming Japanese garb.
One wonders many other things, too.
The play is timed sÂ«.-me fifty or one
hundred years ago in "Old Japan." Yo
San, the heroine, the "darling of the
gods." â .vhose desire it is to marry for
love, is wl^ully charming, but not al
yays in accord with one's familiar
knowledge vt the Japanese eternal fem
inine. It is not in the Japan of Laf
cadio Hearn. for example â and he
knew his .oppon as well as most â that
the Japanese princess refuses in full
court the hand of a suitor proposed to
her by her father; that she owns her
love for a stranger; that she meets the
geisha on familiar terms. Much to a
spoiled .-hild, the "darling of the gods,"
may be allowed, but it do?s not strike
one that the privileges extended here
are in accord with Japanese character.
And here . comos In Miss Bates, the
Yo San. Perhaps the first thing that
ftriketf ore for whom Miss Bates' bril
liant Cigarette I* the latest impression
of the actress is her extraordinary
versatility. It is farthest of cries
from the vivid little vivandiere to the
Japanese prim ess, yet Miss Bates is
as finely convincing in one part as the
otherâ thi?. too, in face of the in
herent implaueibility of the Japanese
role. She gets deliriously the butterfly
spirit of the thing, the half-child, half
woman, that the playwright has
painted.
The performance is full of exquisite
humor, charming in its pathos, deli
cately reserved in its emotional phases
and most admirably Japanese on the
picturesque side. Every movement is
Japanese, every gesture. ' The 'facial
expression is a little marvel in itself,
and oven the delivery is most subtly
s'JKSestive of the Japanese feminine.
II is a delightful performance all
through and can only add to MiBs
BtUes' enviable reputation. -She was
called out after the second act,
cheered to the echo, patriotically be
flowercd, but succeeded only in saying
that she "wished Mr. Belasco were
here to thank you all â and there's
more to come!"
The support is good, even to the
last gorgeously gowned geisha. Albert
Bruning is the minister of war,
Zakkuri. and is good, if not at all
gi'eat. Eugene Ormonde is the rebel
hero. Prince Kara, and does more for
the part than it does for him. George
Wessells is a satisfying Prince of
.Tosan. and there are geishas, bowing
courtiers, acrobats and servants that
fill In the cast in excellent fashion.
The costuming throughout is magnifi
cent and the lighting worthy of Wiz

wholly Japanese, is something that
will delight everybody In some of its
phases?..

Musical comedy is less of an innova

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 27, 1904
WINS BET
AND DIES AT
SAME TIME
Srecia.1 Dispatch to The Call
CHICAGO, Dec. 26. â While Elmer
Hunt, 19 years old, balanced a bottle on
his head this morning, Willarn Dough
erty, who had been boasting of his
prowess as a marksman, attempted to
emulate William Tell by shooting the
bottle. At the second shot, Hunt fell
to the floor dead, with a bullet between
his eyes. ' : V- â  5
Hunt's death was the outcome of a
discussion which arose in a saloon at
Thirty-fifth street and Archer avenue
between Dougherty and several other'
men, as to which was the best marks
man. Dougherty oflered to wager that
he could shoot a bottle off the head of
any of the men. present without in
jury to the man.
Xone of them were .villing to assist
in a test of Dougherty's skill, until
Hunt, who is employed as a porter in
the saloon, finally accepted the wager,
and consented to hold the bottle on his
head.
the Eastern circuits would have made
its removal therefrom until this time
reflective of pecuniary insanity on his
part, and the plea might hold good if
there were no such things as Xo. 2
companies. San Francisco has had a
few of them this season, and apparent
ly was as well content to remunerate
their projectors as if it was paying fur
the original thing. Mr. Savage would
not relish being accused of financial
shortsightedness, so it is more chari
table to condole him with regrets than
to accuse him of anything.
But some of "The Sultan's" gems
have escaped piracy â enough of them
to make as much unfamiliar stuff as
can reasonably be looked for nowadays
in musical comedy. The music and the
situations suffered most from the buc
caneering, Mr. Ade's lines apparently
being considered unsafe to poach. They
were the first dramatic lines of the
quaint humorist, and they are more
truly characteristic of his literary
style than anything later written by
him for the stage. There is a ring of
his "Fables in Slang" in â¢'some of the
speechesâ as for instance the assertion
that "in the United States ladies smoke,
but women don't"; the allusion to the
Sultan's first wife as "the charter mem
ber of the harem." and the reminder
that while hugging in the waltz is
proper, as a stationary amusement it is
not just the thing. There are scores of
such sayings as those that could not
be stolen without certainty of detection
wherever their author's newspaper
work has been read.
Of the music, it is needful only tv
say that it is hardly distinguishable
from the music of a dozen productions
that came and went before the same
rattlety-bang ensembles and the same
unmemorable solos and part songs,
with no striking variations. But the
scenic investiture is lavish. ; Artistic
blending of bright colors on canvas and
in ecstumery keeps the eye pleased
while the singing is in progress, the
jokes cracking and the dancers nim
bling. The "show girls" are statuesque
ly limberâ if the paradox is permissible
âthe "broilers" chic and agile and the
masculine choristers well drilled, both
vocally and in calisthenics.
To say that the principals are well
balanced on a plane above the mediocre
and below the excellent Is about as
much as can honestly be said Mr.
Whir/en, in the titular role, is funny
because the author has allotted him
funny things to say and do. Mr. O'Don
nell feings basso quite acceptably, and
Mr. Lawrence has a tenor of good qual
ity which he uses with commendable
discretion. Miss Maudie Williams also
makes the most of her vocal equipment,
a soprano of limited compass, and Miss
Nellie Williams is physically and salta
torially the soubrette of convention
that no musical comedy could omit
without impairing its title.
It is a hard-working company, "and
there is not a dragging second in either
of the two acts. Recalls were numer
ous last night.
Alcazar.
j It was a happy inspiration of ' tht
j management of the Alcazar Theater to
: present for this holiday week the play
j "Old Heidelberg." which made such a
favorable impression here When pro
duced by Richard Mansfield and his
j company. There is somethingvin the
j play that appeal? to every gnan and
! woman, young or old. The young
prince, having been confined in a cas
tle till he is twenty years of age with
only a tutor to confide in. is sent to the
University of Heidelberg. He is to
j tally unversed in the ways of the
! world and when he sees Kathie, the
innkeeper's pretty niece, he falls in love
with her and his love is reciprocated.
j There is a rude awakening when he is
peremptorily recalled to Karlsburg to
assume the regency, owing to the se
rious illness of his uncle. A marriage
of convenience is arranged and love's
young dream becomes a memory.
There is life in the piece throughout
and the songs and choruses of the stu-
I dents with the glimpse of their rollick
| ing ways help materially in making it
j attractive. It is excellently staged and
I should have a successful run. John
I Craig as Karl Helnrich. the hereditary
prince, gave a finished interpretation of
the part. His scenes with Kathie,
which part was admirably portrayed
by Miss Lillian Lawrence, were pic
tured with faithfulness and realism.
Nothing could have excelled the expres
! pion of the shy, unsophisticated youth
j when he and Kathie have .their -.first
tete-a-tete in the garden of the inn
while the old tutor snores at an ad
joining table blissfully ignorant of his
pupil's rapid progress in lovemaking.
j Doctor Juttner, the old tutor, was
played by John B. Maher with charac
teristic sincerity and ability. Another
I bit of character work ably done was the
role of Kellerman, the old steward of
the students' corps, which was in the
capable hands' of Fred J, Butler. Luke
Conness was effective' as: Lutz r uhe
dignified valet, and Harry. Hilliard had
a congenial role as Graf von Asterberg.
Harry von, Meter was good as a Staats
Minister von Haugk. The other parts
were well sustained.

DUKE OP HAMILTON REGARDED
AS LUCKIEST BRITISH PEER
CHANGE BRINGS HIM TITLES
Weds in Accordance
With His Heart's
*-' IV. tCl Lv^C) â¢
LONDON', Dec. 26. â The Duke of
Hamilton, who recently obtained a
certificate exempting his little son and
heir from vaccination, is regarded as
the luckiest man in the British peer
age. At his birth it did not appear
that he stood the remotest chance of
succeeding to the most illustrious title
in Scotland. His father, grandfather
and. great-grandfather were all second
son; his great-great-grandfather, curi
ously named Anne, in. honor of his
godmother, Queen Anne, was a third
son, and his nearest ducal ancestor
was born as long ago as 1659, when
Cromwell was still alive.: "7:'"
In 1895, when only 33 years old, as
the- descendant of the fourth Duke, he
succeeded his exceedingly distant â con
nection, the twelfth Duke, and there
by became 'the premier" peer of Scot
land and acquired more titles than any
other British nobleman, with the ex
ception of the Duke of Wellington.
Before that he had been known only,
and that not widely, as a lieutenant in
the navy. He gave promise of de
veloping into a good sailor, for with
no other prospects that he could count
on, apparently, save his profession, he
took to it keenly. An accident, which
rendered him permanently lame, com
pelled his retirement from the service
to what promised to be life-long ob
scurity, for Fate had as yet given no
hint of the rich prize she had in store
for him. vY s v5'~
FAMILY FAMED IX HISTOKY
It is as the representative of the
Douglas family, so gloriously famed
in Scotch history, that the ducal Ham
iltcns owe their pre-eminence among
the Scotch nobility. One ancestor, Sir
James Douglas, was a companion in
arn* of Robert Bruce; the first Earl
of Douglas was distinguished at Poic
tiers and other battles; the second de
feated Hotspur and fell at Otterburn
in 1338; trie fourth was severely
v.ounded and taken prisoner at Homil
don. but at Shrewsbury a year later
ho knocked down the King of Eng
land. The first two Dukes of Hamil
ton maintained the fighting reputation
of the family, the first being taiien
prisoner at the battle of Preston in
1048 and the second being slain at
Worcester three years later. The
fourth Duke became one of the most
distinguished statesmen of his time
and perished in a duel with Lord Mo
hur. In 1712, it was suspected through
the treachery of one of the latter's
seconds.
Some of the later heads of the house
added nothing to its luster. The
eleventh Duke was one of the most
intimate friends of Napoleon III, artJ
plunged into ' the wildest,- dissipation
which Paris could afford in the days. of
the second empire. He met his death
eventually by falling down the stairs
of a fashionable restaurant after a
dinner which had left him very un
steady on his legs. His extravagance
greatly impoverished the family ex
chequer. The last Duke did not relish
the idea of the property passing to a
distant kinsman, and by his will did
his best to tie it up, leaving as much
as he was free to dispose of to his
only child, Lady Mary Douglas-Hamil
ton, who celebrated her twentieth
birthday the otheT day.

Central.
Realism reaches its highest develop
ment in "The Heart of Chicago," which
is on this week at the Central Theater.
There are two scenes in the play that
have never been surpassed, if, indeed,
they have been equaled, in the history
of the stage in this city. /
The play opens amid excitement.
Chicago is in flames. Great anxiety is"
depicted on every face and then comes
chaos as the people ' flee for safety.
Again the curtain lifts and the smold
ering ruins and tottering walls are
startlingly realistic. Lurid red, among
leaping flames, the mimic ruins of
granite structures tell the story of the
holocaustâ the greatest .in history. It
is a triumph in stage-craft.
And more realistic still is the scene
in which the hero of the play, engineer
of the express,. la saved from death by
the heroine. The scene portrays a rail
road track- running back in the per
spective seemingly for miles. At the
footlights is a drawbridge. 'The bridge
tender is killed, by villains who throw
the bridge open and turning on the
Vrong signal lights make their escape,
expecting the on-coming train to be

Hamilton Palace, the family seat in
Lanarkshire, is a magnificent building.
Its most striking features are the por
tico, with twelve pillars each composed
of a single block of marble; and the
black marble staircase, with its spa
cious steps and stately balustrade.
Like Stafford House it has a state en
trance which is never used except for
brides or royal guests. The state rooms
are somewhat bare as a result of th*
famous Hamilton sale of many years
ago; but the living rooms of the house
comprise some charming apartments.
Notable among them is a sitting room
that was used by Princess Mary of
Baden, wife of the eleventh Duke. It
contains, among other treasures, a
plain, small writing table with a silver
"N" on the top and a silver tablet with
an inscription stating that the table
formed part of Napoleon's furniture in
his bedroom at St. Helena.

Henry Shumer and Ernest Howell as

as follov.s:
"On December 19 the Japanese sig

PARTIAL
REFORMS
FAVORED
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 26.âEm
peror^Nicholas' long-expected reform
ukase was issued The docu
ment deals, under eight heads, with
practipally all the subjects brought to
the Emperor's attention by the memo
rial of the congress of Zemstvo presi
dents held here last month. While not
specifically pledging the Government to
carry out th^e various reforms in their
entirety, as demanded by the memorial,
the Czar promises that each shall be re
ferred to the Council of Ministers, with
orders to report promptly on the full
est measure of relief which can be ac
corded on the various subjects.
One question not touched by the
ukase is that of the constitutional as
sembly. Neither Is the Jewish religion
specifically mentioned, though freedom
for all creeds or sects, whether Chris
tian or otherwise, is among the sub
jects dealt with. .
The ukase promises an equal and full
enforcement of existing laws; assures
the Zemstvos of the N ruilest possible
measure of self-government and the en
forcement of the laws now existing in
their behalf; promulgates a scheme of
wcrkingmen's insurance; /extends the
liberty of the press and promises a full
legal trial for all persons accused.
The imperial decree.whlch is entitled
"a scheme for the improvement of the
administration of the state," is ad
dressed to the Senate: It first describes
the reforms already undertaken in be
half of the "peasants and continues:

the most Important pillar of the throne of the
autocratic empire. In order that its Inviolate
fulfillment for all alike shall be regarded as
the first duty by all the authorities and in all
Maces subject to us; that its non-fulfillment
shall Inevitably bring with . it legal responsi
bility for every, arbitrary act, and that per
sor.8 who have suffered wrong â¢ by such ' acts
shall be enabled to secure legal redress.
Second â That local ; and . municipal institu
tions should be given as wide seope as possi
ble In the administration of various matters
Rffectlnr local welfare and that they should
have . conferred upon them the necessary in
dependence, within legal limitations, and that
representatives of all sections of the popula
tion interested In local matters should be
called upon in equitable conditions to take
part In those institutions with a view to the
completest satisfaction 'possible of their needs
Besides the Government's and Zemstvo dis
trict Institutions hitherto â â  â 'â¢ existing, . there
should be also . established In ; connection ' wittt.
them public institutions for the administra
tion of local affairs in localities of smaller
extent. ?<SOniBtmSj
â¢ Third â That, in order to secure equality of
persons of all classes before the law. stepa

the measures Introduced by us for the protec
tion of workmen In factories, workshops and
commercial establishments, attention is to be
given to the j question of the introduction of

RELIGIOX AND THE PRESS.
â Fifth â That there should be a /revision of
the exceptional laws decreed at the time of an
unnaralleled outbreak of criminal activity i on
the ; Dart of > thrf" enemies of - public order and
the application of which. was attended with a
grave extension of . the discretionary power -of
the administrative authorities: and that at the
same time steps should be taken for-circum
scribing their aoDlieation ' within : the narrow
est-possible limits' and for assuring that lim
itation at the ; rights of ; private . persons in
volved in that apnlicat'on ; shall only , be per
mitted in cases. where the actual safety of the
state is threatened. , .-...-â¢ '
' Sixth â That , in . confirmation 'Â» of ' my unde
vlatlng heart's desire. ! as expressed in the im
perial manifesto of; March 8, 1003, 1 for, the pro-'
tectlon by the â¢ fundamental \ laws - of the ' em

SALVATION ARMY FEEDS MORE THAN
TWO THOUSAND GUESTS.
At ; noon yesterday the doors of the
Odd Fellows' Hall were thrown open to
waiting hundreds of the poor of San
Francisco by the local branch , of the
Salvation Army. From all parts of the.
oit> came the hungry ones, but prin
cipally from the vast district that lies
south of Market street
. Long before the hour arrived the line
of men, â¢ women and children grew so
Exeat that it required the presence of
two policemen to keep them in line and
prevent' crowding. "Worn out mothers,
holding tired and pale-looking children
in arms or ieading others by the hand,
men in all kinds of . torn and frayed
clothing, and many who were com
pelled to lean upon canes came halting
and limping to the feast.
.And the' unfortunate ones who'came
after 12 o'clock and had to wait tlieir
turn while . the,..others were eating be
came more and more hungry as â  they
saw . the Â» others- departing â¢ with glad
dened faces and the little ones noisily
leaving with pockets bulging with godci
things foraged from the 'tables.
â¢ Below in the kitchens and supply
rooms elaborate preparations had been
made i to . feed the multitude. A largu
force of cooks and waiters, made up of
Salvation Army lads and. lasses, hur-
rled back and forth all morning setting
tables, fixing decorations and preparing
the masses of food. One side of the
large dlning-hall was partitioned i Â«ff
and there stood many tables laden with
loaves of bread and stacks of pies.
One -table was plied high with* celery,
while boxes of apples, oranges, raisins
and nuts were lying around in pro
fusion. . In the kitchen rows of baking
turkeys, rounds at beef and cooking
vegetables sent lip an, aroma through
the outside gratings that whetted the
appetites of the men in line outside.
When the doors were opened, after
what seemed an lntermlnaDle wait, the
women and children were the first ad
mitted and the^rst served- As the six
long tables seating fifty people each
were filled the noise of thÂ» hurrying
waitresses and the clatter, of dishes
soon began. This -noise was drowned
by the music furnished by the army
band, which added its quota to the
hubbub in the, hall, j
The dinner was started with a short
prayer by> Colonel - French, who also
bade the guests welcome in a short
speech, In" which he invited them to
eat all they could and take their time
about it. There was small need of the
advice. Many of the women brought
bags into which they placed fruits and
other eatables, while all the children
left the hall with pockets bulging with
apples and oranges, nuts -and raisins.
From 12 o'clock noon to 4:30 the men
patiently waiting in line outside were
admitted to the hall in detachments of
three hundred and ranged in chairs
along the south side of the hall until
those already seated at the tables had
finished eating. At 4:30, when the last
guest had been served, the waitresses
and helpers, on whom had devolved the
hard work, gathered at the tables and
little was left when all had finished.
The dining hall was decorated in
greens and in the many wreaths of
holly that decorated the center row of
pillars was placed a picture of the late
Mrs. Booth Tucker. Streamers of red.
blue and yellow, the colors of the
Army, were hung from the central pil
lars to the walls. The tables were cov
ered with flowers and holly, and the
newspapers of the ! city gave" -rolls of
clean white paper, strips of which were
removed and fresh paper laid after
each tableful of guests had finished.
Altogether the officers figured that over
2200 guests had been served.
The officers in charge of the affair
were Colonel and Mrs. French, Brig
adier and Mrs. Wood, Major and'Mrs.
F*ynn. Major Fynn had active super
vision of all the preparations for the
dinner, likewise the purchase and~dis
tributlon of supplies. Altogether the
dinner was a splendid success and
many poor people had cause to be
thankful yesterday for the good work
of the army.

Moraga. in his younger days, owned
a large interest in the great Moraga
ranch, .which, however, has been dis
sipated. Moraga's ancestor,' Ignaclo,
was the first Spanish colonist in Cali

Dolores .mission .and was buried in the

THE WIFE'S VERSION.
Mrs. Moraga was a member of the
family which owned the famous Fish
rancho- Her black eyes snapped' to
day as she denied her husband's story.
She said:
Absurd! Preposterous! I, a.' woman of 45,
the mother of many children, married for 25
years, to be Infatuated or to care in any but a
simple friendly way for this student â this
mere boy? Why, Manuel Marker la only 19
years old. a quiet boy, a gentleman. Every
thing my husband has Â«ald about it is false.
. Last Saturday we asked Manuel in to help
us dress the Christmas tree. He is friendly
with all of us except my husband. When
Moraga came and found Manuel in the room
he ordered .him to go. The disturbance that
followed was' bo bad that Manuel â went for
Officer Thompson to have my husband ar
rested for battery. Then, for the sake of
peace, Manuel decided to sleep' elsewhere that
night. Moraga took his clothes and occupied
another apartment than mine, but hÂ« was not
locked out.
If Mr. Moraga Intimates that he will be so
generous as. to go and leave me In possession
of this house and furniture and permits you
to think he Is a wronged but generous man,
listen to this: Mr. Moraga has not a cent of
interest, in- the place. It is all mine; In my
name, bought with my money. My sister and
I sold our interest in the Fish ranch last De
cember and my share Is in this house. Moras*
ciintribotes nothing- but his name to this fam
ily.
It is a horrible thing that he should so act
as to mix the name of his wife, wh6 has been
with him* for 25 years, in such a story as he
tells. It Is a hideous wrong, too, that he does
Manuel Marker. It . cannot but affect his
university life- and it will all be eo deplor
able.
â¢ Mrs.* Moraga broke down and wept
after her^speech. V;
Marker,' the student, /denies that his
delations with. the Moraga. family have
been other than innocent and friendly-
He said to-day, that' MOraga's allega
tions were all false. ...
ON THE TRAIL
OF SMUGGLERS
Special Dispatch to The Call.

WASHINGTON, Dec. - 26.-rFrankÂ» . P.
Sargent; Commissioner of Immigration,
has begun the biggest hunt for Chinese
smugglers on record; Me * has" sent
many special "agents to the -Canadian
frontier to be ready for the attempts
â Â»-hich,it is reported; thedaring band is
about to make to smuggle Chinese in
large numbers into this country by way
of Liverpool,' "Hallf ail and: towns on the
border.
How* much the Chinese have paid to
be smuggled, no one of the Government
Secret Service knows. It Is supposed
to be several â¢ hundred dollars a head.
It Is announced there are many hun
dreds of Chinese to be brought over the
Canadian -border and there is a strong
suspicion that the same smugglers are
implicated in the attempts to. get the
Chinese into the United States by way
of Mexico; ~.\ â  ' > ;â 
" Commissioner "Sargent spent several
days in Canada making an investiga
tion Into the doings of the smugglers.
He had recently returned from a long
trip along the border of Mexico. While
in the South, he organized a corps of
roughriders to patrol the line 4Â» s the
sparsely setlled districts to head off the
Chinese coming this way. While In
Canada- he Increased the force of men
there. â â  The" Chinese will be arrested
as rapidly as they appear.- .The officers
hope they will at the same time be able
to capture the white smugglers.

him in his garret among some lumber
and . given ;to his' little son for a' play
thing, is In reality a rare old instru

operated by SomeYs. By the Italian it
was left on the' place, when he went
East.- â -. '> ,

and then its character was discovered
by. a university student -who chanced
to comÂ© that way. -.. â â â  â  t
The student was a stranger to* Som
ersand did not give his name. ;When

Oakland Office , San Francisco Call,
l$Ti ;. ' \ 1016 Broadway, Dec! 28/.'
, Town building has been ' going on \ in
Contra Costa* County/ In : a remarkabia i
manner' in thfe last few. years. Whera
there were . formerly great; stretches of
unoccupied fields and water front theijT
are now thriving towns with' manuf ab- ;
turing Industries, and it is. little wonder
that, this county, once comparatively"
obscure) has Jumped; to a rank* In manu- !
factured products that Is .second only;
to San Francisco." '
-It was not many yearn ago that Mar
tinea, the .county seat, and Antloch, the
great vriver shipping- point, -were tha
only Incorporated towns In â¢ the coun
.ty. "iNow^ there la a string Lot- towns
from, the Alameda County line to An
tioch, all possessing town govenments,
with others clamoring for the right to
conduct their own, municipal affairs.
Pinole, Hercules and Black Diamond
have all become incorporated towns.
Richmond and Concord are fighting for
the same -privilege. Pinole and Her
cules are powder centers, and they
have experienced a rapid growth, par
ticularly the former, which is now on
the main line of the Santa Fe system.
The wonderful growth of Richmond
from, unoccupied water front lands to
a city of 5000 population In less than
five years is pretty well known
throughout the State. 'Richmond Is
now pointed to as one of the liveliest
towns on the bay shore. ' : 5?!i
But. while this has . been going on
along the western shore- of the county
there â¢ has â  been another case of town
building that is just as remarkable.
A few years ago there was. a wharf
projecting, out* into the waters of the
San Joaquin River, with a tiny settle
ment at the shore end and a little rail
road that ran up to one of the coal
mines on the side of Mount Diablo. It
was known as New York Landing and
when the coal road was" running river
steamers used to stop at the wharf for
their. fuel. "When the mine closed down
New York Landing became little more
â¢ f than . a. , fishing r village. , ,-Suddenly the
village woke up. Several large .manu
facturing ? plants that; wanted deep
water located ' .there, the name was
changed from New York Landing; to
Black Diamond^ and- 'now- If Is* Tan ln^c.
corporated town with a population' that
Is estimated between 3500 and, 4000. â¢
j*ot. satisfied with this," another town
Is being planned and will be launched
'during "1905. It is to be cailed Morton
arid will be ' built between Black Dia
mond ' and Antloch. The Bulls Head
Oil Company, â¢ the Mountain Copper
Company from Keswick," Shasta Coun
ty, the Bowers Rubber Company and
the W. T. Garratt Foundry Company
will â¢ have plants at " this point and a
town will be \ forced" to settle around
them.
New factories are going up continu
ally,'and those already established are
Increasing their capacity. A* list'of the

OBJECTS- TO V DIVISION
County Now Gets^Collected
JFines in Cases Where the
Offenses Are Statutory
* v
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec 39.
Police Judge Mortimer Smith has
prepared a bill for Introduction at tha
forthcoming session of the State' Leg
islature which is designea to correct a
condition by which much of the police
work of Oakland inures to the financial
benefit alone of the treasury .of Ala
meda County. In short, ' Judge Smith
purposes to change the existing, law
by which all fines collected In the
Police Courts Imposed in cases. of con
viction of statutory offenses as well
as of municipal ordinances shall go> Into
the 'city treasury.
Under existing taw fines collected in
cases of convlcton for all offenses made
such by the State Penal Code are de
posited with the county treasury. Such
moneys are used solely by the county
government. The only benefit- the
municipality gets from' fines In th>
Police Courts is that which comes from
those levied in cases of violations of
municipal ordinances, such as bicycle
riding unlawfully and the like.
About .70 per cent of the money col
lected for fines in the Police" Courts
goes- into the county treasury jwder
the provisions of the law as It exists.
Fines Imposed in larceny, oatteryv lo* -
tery and such cases are all sub feet to
county control because tne crimes are
statutory. â¢ â - â¢ >- ' ?
face of this sltnatldn the en
tire expense of maintaining the > Police
Courts falls^ Upon, the Iclty,. The county
does not pay a cent toward the cost
excent :ln; the item of fees '. ofsftenog
rapherS}< i "who record the â¢ testimony
'at preliminary examination*. On
a general estimate Police Judge Smith
figures that of each $1000 collected in
fines the clerk is compelled to turn
over to the county from $650 to '1700,
leaving only $300 to $350 as the city's
share. The bill that has been drawn
will overcome 1 thld condition by giving
cities of Oakland's class the right to
hold all fines collected in the Police
Courts. Judge Smith, In explaining the
point to-day, said:
The burden of cost of maintain trig th<Â» polio*
courts falls entirely upon the city of Oakland.
Tha county gets the lion's shara of tha rerÂ»
mie from these courts and tha cit7 foots tha
bills. To my mind It is an anomalous condi
tion that should be corrected. Tha police* paid
by Oakland, raid a disorderly house or a> lot
tery den. Fines are Imposed In tha polios
courts and every dollar must eo to tha county
treasury. The county did not rpend a cent la
tha arrest or (he prosecution fa- such a casa.
Every dollar. of fines should go to. tha city and
I purpose to reframa the law to reaca tha
point.
As conditions exist tha city mast taka
charge of a convicted vagrant. Ha cannot ba
sent to the County Jail to server a- tana of Im
prisonment. Tet If a convicted vagrant shoold
ray a fine that Ona would go to tha oounty
treasury. . ' y.-y â â¢â¢ â¢..â¢.:'
The bill win be placed In the haoda

MSTHEWS' PICTURES OT HOPKINS
Decorations for Oakland Public Library
May Be Seen This Week, .
Arthur F. Mathexrs has placed on
exhibition at the Mark Hopkins In
stitute of Art tn-o completed raura'
decsrations and cartoons of eight oth
ers he is executing for the Oakland
public library. Through the courtesy
of the trustees of the Oakland library
Str. iJathews was permitted to exhibit
his work and during the remainder of
the week the decorations will be open
to public inspection without charge.
Mr. Malhews' conception of the pur
prse of the mural decorations for the
library is best set forth in bis own
language- He says:
- Th* frchpme cf decoration for the walls of thÂ»
reading room of the Oakland Library con
trrr.pJates the placing of twelve panel* varying
fcn *ize from ten feet in height by eight feet
*;r inches In width to eleven feet in height by
nine f~t in width. These will be s?en at an
pl^vstion of about seven feet from the floor,
8b-vc tte book i- tacks. In some Instances oc
cupying the âºrÂ»tÂ» between the windows, in
.ethers conforming to the architectural fea
ture* of UiC walls.
Th* room in its general arrangement re
â clven iuÂ»lf Into two apartment*. The deoora
tlot;* for each are treated In separate series,
or." having for Its themr "Nature." the other
"The Art*." The two completed panels ou
Â»*h!bition are prpliminar>-. and. In a way, ln
trrviuciory to there central Ide&s: th* first rep
rÂ»>s*-niinÂ«: "Sentiment." that spiritual origin
from whicZn the arts have In ail aÂ«es derlred
thÂ»>ir V>eing: and the second. "Achievement."
wherein tfce t^j fueling is materia-liiod. In
the foTnrr are gpÂ»n the sources of inspiration:
<*rti!e nature in its fat~st gruisc: the serene
fcf-autv. purity end nobility of woman: the
htily tn>T?erj- of motherhood: the filial love and
â > eneraf.on of the child in its daw-nlng life and
thr divine spirit which animates and rules all
cr^ate.1 thlnrs. In the second are the practical
rnarlfostatiors of theÂ«e Idealistic qualities as
shown in the art worker.
Tfce rcntlnTiaiion of the themes is presented
in the original Â«-*rt<v>ri< for thÂ« euccesslv* pÂ«n
+\? UndÂ»r thÂ» !i<ad of â¢â¢Nature" are: "The

bÂ«in; ck >ct unfinished.
Mr. Mathews has executed the paneia
in " subdued. harmoniously blended
tones. There is none of the poster
harshness that characterizes some of
this work, and, while this Jfe true, his
characters lose none of that strength
that makes such works ideally sym
bolical of the subject chosen.

Robert Johnston, a nine-year-old
boy residing: at 228 Fell street, added
a sensational chapter to his history
yesterday in falling from the third
story of a new building: at Franklin
street and Hickory avenue and es
caping with his life.
The boy, with other companions of
similar age, undertook to climb a per
pendicular ladder, as thoy had seen
workmen do while erecting the struc
ture. The going: up was successfully
accomplished, but Johnston's descent
was more rapid and sensational..
When found at the bottom the lad
had a broken thijjh bone and a deep
lacerated wound on his head. He told
Dr. C. E. Millar at the Emergency
Hospital, where he was taken to be
fixed up, that it was "awful funny
while he was coming: down."

A CIVIL WAR CAPTAIN'.

Talks to the I'ofnt.
"Until about two years ago I had
had piles for about thirty years, at
times bleeding and very nalnfuli I got
a fifty-cent box of Pyramid. Pile Cure
at the drug store, and used it and' was
entirely cured: got another box In case
I needed it. and as the piles did not
return In eix months I gave the remedy
to a friend of mine who wanted the
doctor to operate to cure him. My
friend . said he .would .use -the -'pyra-
mids.' but he knew they would do him
no good, but they cured him- of . piles
of twenty-five years 1 standing. I am free
froÂ«:i r)lleÂ£ to-day, and have been. since,
using Pyramid Pile Cure. I was. Cap-
tain in the Civil War." James Adams,
Soldiers' Home, Cal.
The majority of people labor under
i\ta impression that an operation is
necessary in severe cases of piles, or
hemorrhoidj-', and are very skeptical
regarding the remedial virtues of any
medicinal compound. . Testimony like
the above should certainly have a
tendency to dispel' this impression, al-
though It is odd that such a fallacy
should prevail, and still more odd that
so many people should think an oper-
ation effects a permanent cure, where-
as the contrary is more often the case.
We advise all sufferers from this
painful complaint to buy a fifty-cent
package of Pyramid Pile Cure at any
drug store and try It to-night.
Those interested cannot be too
strongly urged to write Pyramid Drug
Co., Marshall, Mich., for their little
book describing the causes and cure of
Piles, as it contains valuable Informa-
tion, and Is sent free for the asking. .

POOR CHILDREN
NOT FORGOTTEN
Santa Claus Is Generous
to San Francisco's Less
Fortunate â¢ Little Ones
Between five and six hundred poor
little children were made richly hap
py "last night when they were handed
Christmas gifts by the Volunteers of
America. The Juvcni!" festival. of sur
prises and thankfulness took place in
the basement $ of Pioneer Hall, which
was packed to the doors. Colonel and
Mrs. Duncan and others of the organi
zation assisted Santa Claus to deliver
to the eager little chaps and lassies
the toys which will be cherished by
them until another lik.? season returns.
There were go-carts for the scantily
clad boy, who perchanc* had never be
fore known such kindness; there were
books and firemen's big, red protecting
head gear and fire department trucks
and ever so many other articles which
will assure hours of innocent pleasure
for the recipients.
The girls were presented with great
dolls and medium dolls and small doi'.s
and toy furniture, which came pretty
nearly being the real thing: books
and blackboards and other articles
which would give the child receiving
them. an. Impetus to study.
When all the Christmas gifts had
been distributed there came the presen
tation of boxes of candies and great
luscious California oranges and the eye3
of the children fairly bulged with de
light as they carted all their presents
away from the building to their, in
very many cases, exceedingly humble
homes, â  .â¢
; Colonel Duncan and his wife planned
a musical programme as a preface to
the.presentation of gifts, and the good
behavior of the children while the en
tertainment was proceeding spoke
volumes for the little ones, some of
whom are being reared under sad con-
ditions
The Volunteers of America have I
brought joy to numerous souls this i
yuletidc. They have distributed 5000 j
meals, including baskets of foods; and
their proteges at the. Maud Booth Chil
dren's Home, 599 Buena Vista street,' j

A NEW KIND OF TRUST.
HP HE Smoot case has been directed to the development <?f the
1 moral question involved. Those conducting the side adverse to
the Senator have searched for testimony to prove that the prac
tice of polygamy continues, that plural marriages are se
cretly solemnized, and that the Mormon leaders arc deter
mined that the institution shall not die out, but that it shall be
among the teachings of the church, preserved as a divine revelation,
until thÂ« coming of better days, when its enjoyment can be without
fear ot punishment.
Collateral to this inquiry some success has attended the effort
:o disclose the secret3 of the Endowment House, the private cere
monies of the temple and the oaths which bind the brethren to
gether. In this field the revelations are somewhat startling. The
oaths are fearful in their nature, and invoke upon those who violate
them the severe phj'sical penalty of death by mutilation. In this
part of the investigation it is shown that superstition is used as a
powerful means of subjecting the human will to the control of be
liefs and practices which revolt human reas6n when it is free from a
degrading faith in the supernatural.
The oath of vengeance, which has a high place in these impre
cations, pledges every endowed Mormon to avenge upon this na
tion the martyrdom of the prophets, Joseph and Hyrum Smith. This
path has been called treasonable, but it is doubtful if "it come under
the- constitutional definition that treason shall consist in levying
war upon the United States or giving aid and comfort to its ene
â¢niies. This requires either an overt act, or, perhaps, the inciting of
â¢ others to an overt act. But, without discussing definitions, such an
oath is incompatible with American citizenship, and should work
the disfranchi?ement of all members of a body which makes it a
part of its secret ritual.
Visitors to Salt Lake City on public occasions will recall the per
fervid professions of loyalty indulged in by the Apostles in their
public addresses in the presence of Gentiles., Oratorical members of
the Smith family, the descendants of Joseph and Hyrum, are the
most prolific of this sort of protestation. They profess to be "the"
Americans, and their elaborate ascriptions to this nation and its in
stitutions prove now to come from lips that have taken a solemn
oath to avenge upon the republic by blood atonement the martyr
dom of the founders of their church polity.
All this has been discovered and suggested by the inquiry into
the continuance of polygamy. But that, while serious, is not the
most serious aspect of the case. We don't know that tjiis can be de
veloped in the present inquiry, though it has been touched upon. The
policy of the Mormon leaders is one conceived in the most subtle
and profound craft. The leadership of the church is a self-perpetuat
ing corporation. It has inherited and enlarged upon the vast plans
formed in the exalted business genius of Brigham Young, along
with his determination to isolate a Mormon State, that, no matter
what its public form, should be a hierarchy the most absolute since
.Israel.
The church is a business corporation for this purpose. Tithing
brings it an income estimated at $1,600,000 per annum. The church
owns street railroads, manufacturing establishments, mines, sugar
mills, stores and all of the active enterprises necessary to community
life. It controls all means of transportation that thread Zion except
the overland roads, and for the sake of peace with the hierarchy
President Smith is made a director in these. The policy of non
intercourse with Gentiles is manifested in a multitude of ways. To
he .a street-car operator, get employment as" a clerk, dig ore in the
church mines or reduce it in a church smelter, be a public school
teacher or get employment as a handicraftsman, it is necessary to
be a Mormon. And even r Mormon public school teacher, street-car
man,. miner, smelter, clerk and craftsman has to pay in tithes to the
church one-tenth of all earnings every year. If the employment of a
Gentile is permitted, no tithes are forthcoming. The public employes
are paid out of the taxes of Mormon and non-Mormon alike, and so
fvery non-Mormon is by compulsion a contributor to the church
tithes. The church is a member of the salt trust, it owns all of the
influential banks, and credit is given grudgingly to the Gentile, and
when extended is liable to be used to his financial undoing. â¢
In the Smoot investigation it is in proof that the church sends an
order to the public school teachers, prescribing the teaching of the
church doctrines during school hours every day, and that in hun
dreds of public schools, supported by the taxation of Mormons and
non-Mormons alike. Mormon religion is taught daily as a part of the
curriculum. Resort by Gentiles to the judicial courts in issues
affecting their property or other rights is becoming precarious, since
it is evident that his endowment oath of fidelity to the church and
the- brethren nullifies a juror's oath to do justice.
It will be seen that in this system of church control of the secular
property and business of the State is the power to expel by merely
negative resistance the whole Gentile element. Already it is com
plained that Gentiles find getting a living harder and harder, and an
exodus is apparent. When this deliberately planned process has
performed its glacier-like function Zion will be Mormon in its
society, business and government. The dream of Brigham Young
will be realized and the church will be independent. There will be
no conscience but the church conscience, no obligatory oath but that
of the Endowment House, and the freedom of different opinions, the
brightening friction of individual competition and the varieties of
personal opinion and action necessary for civil liberty and indispen
sable to a free state will be unknown. Then the practice of poly
gamy, being punishable only in the courts, will go unpunished by
polygamous juries. The body will be that of an American State, but
the soul will be a pitiless and tyrannical hierarchy.
In such a State will be bred the colonies to "reinforce those that
have already swarmed over Idaho, Wyoming and Arizona, and that
are appearing in Nevada and wherever the money of the United
States is building irrigation plants to make homes. By this radiat
ing process the intermounlain region will fall so far under Mormon
control as to be a cordon of buffer States between Zion and the re
public. To the thoughtful this far-reaching policy, now in opera
tion and moving as inexorably as the forces of nature, is the portcn
lous and appalling aspect in which Mormonism presents itself. With
millions in its hands, the endowment oaths in its heart and profes
sions of loyalty upon its lips, the church is moving forward to a
material conquest that will extirpate every Gentile in its path and
leave it the sole autocrat.
LONDpN'S LATEST FREAK
THE silly season still lingers in London. Recently there made
its first appearance over there a periodical bearing the name
The Brutihtanan," and self-heralded as the advocate of brute
force in the conduct of life's daily round. The editor of the freak
Magazine declares himself to be committed to the revival of floxxins
as puiyshment for petty crimesâ public flogging with no distinction
between sexes. Vigorous caning in the schools would, he believes
raise the moral tone of the British race. A general knock-down-ami
drag-out policy pursued by the guardians of the law would serve to
toughen. the stamina and stiffen the mental fiber of King Edward's
people. /
"The Brutilitarian" sees the light about a hundred years too
late. Had it appeared in those good old days of the Georges when
one was hanged, and possibly quartered, for stealing a loaf of bread
or whipped at the cart's tail with bell and candle for casting asper
sions upon the Government, it would have had tremendous* vogue.
Under what the strenuous London editor is pleased to deem the pres
ent painful conditions of neurotic and ultra-humanitarian society,
there seems to be nothing for it but that this gory sheet set up its
presses in King Leopold's domain of the Congo or establish a branch
in the hcad-huntingdistricts of Borneo.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, DECEMBER 27, .1904.
FOR THE SAKE OF TOM
A MOST wonderful and gorgeous
Christmas tree stood In the win
dow of the great store of Warden
& Joyce. All day a constantly
changing throng of small admir
ers exclaimed at Its magnificence and
registered extravagant wishes before
it..
Children richly clad and full of Joy
ous anticipations, children in comfort
less rags who knew Christmas only
by the sight of t the happiness of
others, stood side by side and gazed
with longing: eyes at the bewildering
array of costly gifts and brilliant dec
orations.
A small girl of 12 or 14, with face
unnaturally old and sharp, unsmiling
eyes, critically examined the tree in
silence. Up and down, from side to
side, her keen gaze wandered.
"I bet it's empty at the back," she
finally mutterad, half longingly, half
scornfully.
Poor child! Her brief experience
had already taught her the unreality
and falsity of many glittering things.
She stepped quickly into the vestibule
where she could see that part of the
tree away from the window. A sud
den joy flashed into her face.
"It's true â that tree is true," she
whispered eagerly; "the back is as
good as the lront."
She hesitated an instant and then
raised her clasped hands beseechingly.
"God," she cried, "send me a tree
for Tommy!"
Her intense longing made her voice
sharply Imperative, and the first word
struck harshly on the ear of a richly
dressed young lady who was passing
close to her.
"You mustn't swear, child!" she ex
claimed hurriedly".
"I wasn't swearing," the girl an
swered calmly, without resentment; "I
was praying for a tree for Tommy."
An elegant carriage waited at the
curb, and as the young lady stepped
to the sidewalk the footman threw open
the door. She stood for an instant, as
if thinking, and then, turning quickly,
she went back Into the vestibule where
the child was still standing.
"Will you come with me a minute?
Out of the crowd," she added hastily,
as the girl faced her with surprised
eyes and an unchild-like, repelling look
on her thin face.
"Wil you step into the carriage?
Please do. I want you to tell me some
thing, and it is so very cold â "
The girl seated herself on the luxu

about Tommy." She lingered loving
ly over the name. "Why did you pray

"Because he's sick. He's only twelve,

FIRST CAMPAIGN EMBLEM
So far as known 'the first campaign
emblem was a finger ring of copper.
It was ; worn by the adherents of John
Quincy Adams in 1825, when he" ran for
President, and was inscribed "John
Quincy Adams, 1825-" Tintypes and
medallions were .among the insignia
of the 1860. campaign.

would let me arrange a tree for your

The girl drew a long breath.
"It ain't charity?" she asked doubt
fully.
"Not to you nor to Tommy," an
swered Miss Stanhope joyously, "but
It will be to me."
"For Tommy's sake," murmured the
girl assentlngly.
"For Tom's sake." echoed Miss
Stanhope tenderly. .
The unbending footman was ' still
more disgusted when he was directed
to make another round of the stores,
and his bearing was absolutely frigid
when he was required to carry a most
unbecoming load of bundles up the
stairs to the little home on Burnham
street. That the indignity of a good
sized tree was laid upon him also re
quired the- concentration of all his
thoughts upon the generous wages
Miss Stanhope paid, to enable him to
endure the present situation.
"I keep house for father and Tom
my," whispered Maggie, leading the
way. "Tommy's in the kitchen. I
left him there in the big chair 'cause
it's warmer. We'll take all these
things in here"â opening the door of
a neat sitting-roomâ "and when we
get the tree fixed I'll push him in in

Surely, never before was a tree so
quickly made to blossom and bring
forth fruit, and it was a "true" tree,
with gifts on every side.
Maggie surveyed it with joyful
pride, her thin face losing its. care
worn loo"k, and becoming almost child
like with the flush of. happy excite
ment.
- "Miss Stanhope." she whispered
positively, "prayers are answered â I
know it now."
"Always In the way he, thinks
best," answered Miss Stanhope earn
estly, adding in her heart. "Lord, I
believeâ help thou mine unbelief!"
"I'll bring Tommy in now." Mag
gie said, and went softly out to the
kitchen.
She returned almost Immediately.
"His boss is here/' she exclaimed
excitedly, "he got back yesterday.
Ain't he awfully good to come so soon
to see Tommy? Tommy looks bet
ter already! The boss'll push him in."
They both turned toward the door
as it was opened and a big armchair
with the sick boy in it was pushed
carefully over the threshold.
Miss Stanhope gave one look at the
tall man behind the chair arid started
forward.
"This is Tommy's boss," began
Maggie, mindful of her duties as host
ess, but the greeting of her two guests
quite disconcerted her; for "Tommy's
boss' caught the aristocratic Miss
Stanhope in n close embrace, while
Miss Stanhope cried penitently, "Oh,
Tom. Tom, I have been so sorry, and
I have wanted you so!"

MARKTWAIN'S "BEQUEST"
Mark Twain contributes to the
Christmas number of Harper's Weekly
a short story written in the vein of his
old-time humor. The story is. called
"The $30,000 Bequest" and tells of the
dreams and airicastles of a young
couple who believe they are about to
come Into a fortune. The manner In
â which they assume control of their im
aginary inheritance ($30,000 at the
start) and by a series of splendid in
vestments , quickly develop it into an
amazingly large fortune, until the
bubble finally bursts just when they
are about to become rivals of the
world's greatest financiers, is told in
Mark Twain's best humorous style.
The story is illustrated with pictures
in color and tint by Peter Newell.

To-night the men and maids and the
stunning matrons of the Assembly will
fare forth in the full panoply of glee
and gladsome ttfgs. And a merry
Christmas dance will be on, fraught
with the spontaneity of yuletida fun.

early attendance. So have the belles,

At recent dances the feminine contin

since the Martin ball at the St. Frances

And blessings on the maids who will
arrive in time to save the patronesses
from suffering from ennui! It's so
stupid to bid welcome to a few strag

for the guests who arrive in good time.

POSTMASTERS
OVER-MARRIED
Six Cases of Polygamy in
Idaho Found Among* the
Officials of Government
Special Diexmtcb to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26. â In response
to a resolution introduced by Senator
Dubois of Idaho and passed by the
Senate, Postmaster General Wynne
has made an investigation of the post
masters of Idaho to learn if there are
any polygamists among them. He has
found a half dozen Federal postmas
ters in that State living with plu
ral wives. His report on the case was
completed to-day and turned over to
the President, who wished to examine
it before sending it to the Senate. Not
all of the Mormon postmasters are
polygamists.
Whether President Roosevelt in
tends to remove the polygamous post
masters has not been disclosed, but it
is believed some official action of this
character will be taken now that the
fact has been brought to his attention.
As for the violation of the law, thai is
a matter to be dealt with by the State
authorities. It is entirely -within the
power of the President, however, to
remove Government officials for such
cause.
Wynne's investigation showed that
some of the polygamous Mormons
holding office in Idaho took plural
wives before the Edmunds law was
passed and the Woodruff manifesto
prohibiting polygamy. How many of
them entered into plural marriages af
ter the Edmunds law was enacted has
not been ascertained, but if anything
Is done at all it is probable that all
will be treated alike.

Epecial Dispatch to The Call,
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON', Dec. .26. â Miss Mar
guerite Hdye Leiter, popularly known
as "Daisy," the youngest and only un
married daughter of the late Levi Z.
Leiter, was married to-day at noon
to Henry Mollneaux Page Howard,
nineteenth Earl of Suffolk and Berk
shire. Miss Leiter is the third daugh
ter'of the house to contract a marriage
with a noble family of England. Her
eldest sister, who was Miss Mary, mar
ried Lord Curzbn, Viceroy of India.
Her other sister, Miss Nancy, married
Major Colin Campbell, a cousin of the
Duke of Argyle, on November 29 last.
While to-day's wedding was ex
tremely quiet, it lacked none of the
glamour of music, lights and flowers.
The stately drawing-room, library and
dining-room of the Leiter mansion
were fragrant with delicate white blos
soms, which were banked against a
background of smilax and palms,
while the suggestion of the Christmas
season waa given by the holly and bril
liant poinsettia that adorned the din
ing-room. â  *
While the strains of a string or
chestra sounded sweetly through the
house, the silken rustle of the bridal
gown proclaimed the approach of the
bride. Long known as one of the
beauties of the capital, Miss Leiter
never looked lovelier^ than to-day in
her soft clinging gown of Hbertin
satin, veiled with exquisite point dc
Vcnise lace, over which fell her tulle
veil, held In place by a tiara of dia
monds. This tiara is one of the hand
somest jewels of a rare collection of
family heirlooms which the Earl pre
sented to his bride. A long rope of
pearls, the favorite Jewel of the bride
and which was the gift of her mother,
was worn around her throat. She car
ried a graceful loose cluster of white
orchids and roses.
Escorted by her brother, Joseph
Leiter. she approached the window re
cess where the Earl and his best man,
Lionel Guest, a son of Lord Winborn
of England, awaited her. The Rev.
Dr. Roland Cotton Smith, rector of
St. John's Church, which the family
attends, performed the ceremony ac
cording to the Episcopal ritual.
Mrs. Leiter. Mrs. Colin Campbell,
Lady Nina Howard, a sister of the
Earl, .who has been with him since
his arrival in this country, were the
only other persons to witness the cere
mony.
After the ceremony the party, re

wedding breakfast was served. The
Earl and Countess of Suffolk left
Washington late in the afternoon for
New York and will sail on Wednesday
for England, probably having for their
companions Major and Mrs. Campbell.
The Earl will take his bride to Charl

RUDE BOREAS SPOILS
PLANS FOR CHRISTMAS
STEAMSHIP ANUBIS ARRIVES
Passengers Celebrate Holiday at Sea
The Kosmos liner Anufcls, following
close on the heels of the Nekoi arrived
yesterday from Hamburg and South
and Central American ports. When^the
Anubis left Manzanillo Captain" Reim
ers expected to reach here in time to
spend at least the latter, half of Christ
mas day at this port. The north wind,
however, interfered with the carrying
out of the programme. The Anubis
was light and high enougn out'of the
water to give rude Boreas something
to blow at. As the wind stirred up the
sea the order to reduce. speed was given
as the effort to overcome with a flying
rush the opposition of the elements
proved disconcerting to the passengers.
Christmas was celebrated at sea and
after dinner officers and passengers
gathered around a broom, daubed with
green paint and decorated with electric
light globes and pretsels, and wished
each other the compliments of the sea
son. !
Henry C. Sergeant, one of the pas
sengers, was the victim of a painful
accident on Christmas . eve. Sergeant,
who la an elderly man, Is .very short
sighted. While ashore at Acapulco he
lost his eyeglasses, thus adding to his
handicap. Walking across the saloon
on Christmas eve Sergeant tripped
over a stool. The ship was rolling
heavily and the passenger was sent
with a crash, against a bulkhead, frac
turing a bone in his shoulder. .
, At San Benito a large man-eating
shark was captured by the crew of tho
Anubis and slain on deck for the en
terjtainment of the passengers.
The Anubis brought f 1876 tons of
cargo. This included thirteen bars of
copper bullion valued at about $60,000.
She brought a large shipment qf coffee,
alligator hides and ore. '/â 
Her passengers, included the follow^
ing:
Henry C. Sergeant, J. G. Harrell, George R.
Elsart, J. L. Milllgan. Miss Elizabeth Wlesen,
Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Lesher and daughter,
Mrs. E. Mordaunt, Miss B. M. Mordaunt,-Mel
rose Mordaunt.
Cliehalis Has Narrow- Escape,
The steam schooner Chehalis, -which arrived
yesterday from Grays. Harbor, had* a 'narrow
escape from destruction b! most at the end of
her voyage. She passed through, the, heads
safely, but barely was she inside when her
tail shaft broke, leaving the vessel helpless in
swift running waters. Fortunately , for vessel
and all on board Captain Johannson has a
level head and a brain that acts quickly. The
anchor was dropped and, again fortunately,
found a holding place on the bottom. Had the
*haft gone while the vessel was passing
through the heads, nothing could have | saved
her I and her danger would have been equally
great had the anchor failed t* hold. ThÂ«
Chehalis was towed to Mission street, where
she landed her passengers. She left yesterday
afternoon for the south In tow of the steam
schooner Northland. =-.."â¢; Â»
Rammed by Her Escort.
The barkentine Fullerton, which arrived yes
terday from the Columbia River in tow of the
steamer Whittler, was run Into by the Whit
tier on December 23 and damaged to the ex
tent of about $1000. The vessels were about
80 miles south of the Columbia River, bucking
a stlft southeaster. The hawser parted and
when she tried to put another line aboard the
Fullerton the Whittier*f sharp nose poked itself
deep into the barkentine' s side. The Puller
ton's guard planks were stova In and the
woodwork Jn her cabin was much damaged.
Water Front Xotes.
The tust Champerico, which left here for
Champerico with the lighter Quezaltenango in
tow, arrived on Christmas day at her des
tination.
Thirteen vessels of all sorts and sizes sailed
yesterday for coast porta. Among the depar
tuics were the steamers City of Pueblo and
Santa Ros&, both scheduled to leave on Christ
mas day, but held In port on account of the
holiday.
The brig Tanner Is once again tempting fate
on the open sea. She sailed yesterday for Port
Angeles. She came in here . leaking like a
sieve and afty, being repaired as .well as &
fifty-year-old wooden vessel can be has started
out to make a voyage that, at this time of
year, tries the timbers of the stoutest ves
sels.

GORKY DEFIES
HISSING CROWD
Hostile Reception Accorded
His Play in St. Petersburg
Fails to Wither Author
OSCAR WILDE REVIVAL
"Charley's Aunt" Has Over
Hundred and Twenty Thou
sand Productions to Credit
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 26.â Maxim Gorky has
found a way of dealing with a hostile
theater audience â  which ought to com
mend Itself to playwrights and actor
managers the world over. Heretofore
It has been etiquette for the dramatist,
whose . appearance after the final cur
tain has been greeted with "boos,"
hisses or cat-calls, to take it all in a
chastened spirit and to retire apologeti
cally; and with a crestfallen bow. But
Gorky has changed all that. For If the
telegraphic accounts are to be believed,
an audience which hissed the first per
formance of his ," new play "The " Rus
tics" in- St.' Petersburg, | the other night,
was ; treated In truly withering fashion
by the author.
'.'The. curtain was raised," says ; .t_e
cabled account, "and Gorky appeared
alone, his head thrown back, a look of
contempt on: his countenance! "his fists
clenched and his face livid, as If ' he
wished^ to fling in the face of the peo
ple" a deadly, insult." *
David Belasco fled precipitately be
fore the London booers of "Zaza," and
even William Gillette ventured only to
make a sardonic remark or two when
the Lyceum galleryltes f ell upon "Sher
lock Holmes," so | it ; will be impossible
to say what will be the effect when a
Jeering crowd; in this country beholds
its would-be victim with, say, his shirt
sleeves rolled up or his fists clenched
In the Gorky manner.
The .dinner given to* Edward Terry
the other night, on the eve of the veter
an actor's departure for his first visit
to: the United States; was a great suc
cess. -By far the most Interesting
feature <5f it v/as a letter f rorri A. W.
Pinero in which the author'of "Letty"
and* "The Second Mrs.' Tanqueray"
paid a high compliment to Terry and,
incidentally, a higher one to American
theater-goers. -
"I -trust," wrote Piriero, in apologiz
ing for not being present at the dinner,
"that Mr. Terry will have a prosperous
season in America. He will at least
find the | keenest and most intelligent
audience in the world." Of Terry him
self Mhe playwright went on, "he' is
an actor who has enabled me to de
part from my rule not to witness per
formances of my own plays, for on
those occasions when he has, appeared
in a piece of my writing l' have felt
sure that his skill, Inventiveness and
genuine humor would enable me to for
get the imperfections of my work, and
in this \ have never been disappointed."
Terry, of course," made* his greatest
success in Pinero's VSweet : Lavender,"
which : he has played over '4000 times. |
Since ,' the 'production of "The Walls
of "Jericho." which is so successful that
the American rights already have been
secured, there have been many at
tempts to make a stern moralist out of
its authorâ Alfred Sutro. But while
the role of social censor has been un
dertaken with considerable profit by
several folks of late, Sutro declines It
and prefers to be recognized as a dra
matist whose motto is "success." He
put it rather neatly In an interview
the other, day, when he said: "My busi- J
ness is merely to write plays that shall
interest people. But I don't mind ad- t
mltting that I naturally sympathize
with the side of the angels, while I
don't admit for a moment .â  that the
stage is a pulpit."
"But weren't you annoyed," was the
query,, "at the word 'conventional' as
applied by some of the critics to 'The
Walls of .Jericho' ?">
"By no means," answered Sutro.
"One or two critics, remembering my
association with Maeterlinck, deplored
that I wound up the play In the good
old fashioned way and that my gen
eral treatment was not - more original.
Well, let my answer be ', this bo&k,"
and he* produced a neat little volume
from a shelfâ "a play of mine, pub
lished five years ago/ called 'The Cavo
of Illusion.' It received high praise !
from the , press; it was judged to .be
original in treatment and powerful in
its ending, which of course was un
happy. Two hundred copies ; of the
book were sold in all ; not : a manager
has ever ,; asked me for it, and to-day
it is so entirely forgotten that 'The
â¢Walls of Jericho' was referred to by
nearly all as my first attempt at a
play other than a curtain-raiser."
"There seems likely, to be a -boom' in
Oscar? Wilde's plays in this country.

GARFIELD PLAN
NOT A NEW ONE
Mammoth Standard Oil
Trust Itself First to Ad
vocate Federal Control
JOKE ON , COMMISSIONER
His Report Recalls Sur
prising Statement by a
Big Corporation Official
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.â It turns out
that Commissioner James R. Garfleld's
plan for Federal control of great State
corporations" not only is not new, but
that the Idea is a mere repetition of
propositions first made by the Standard
Oil Company. This , interesting and
somewhat humorous development In the
agitation for the control of trusts has
attracted much attention and has
'Caused some statesmen to pause and
think.
Before the Industrial commission ap
pointed by President - McKinley, John
D. Archibald of the Standard Oil Com
pany, on September 8. 1899, made this
remarkable statement :
"" If you should ask me, gentlemen, what leg
islation can be Imposed to improve, present
conditions, I answer that the next treat â and
to - my mind inevitableâ step of progress in
our commercial development lies In the direc
tion of national or -Federal control of corpora
tions. If such corporations should be madÂ»
possible under such fair restriction and revis
ion as should be attached to them, any branch
of business could be freely entered upon by all
comers, and the talk of tha monopoly would
forever be done away with.
Archibald's remedy for the situation
which has since developed is almost
identical with the proposition made by
Commissioner Garfleld in his anunal
report. The official of the Standard
Oil Company, In advocating Federal
charters, did object to what he called
restrictive legislation. On this subject
he said to the Commlsioners:
The outcry, gentlemen, against corporation*
doea not come from the great, busy. Indus
trial classes, but from Impractical sentimen
talist*, yellow Journals and political dema
gogues â from the latter, perhaps, more than
any other. It Is a veritable attack upon thrift
and prosperity. TO listen to their voices to
tha extent of reposing restrictive legislation
would mean a frightful step backward In the
commercial development of our country.
likely to be done in London before
long. Moreover, Wilde's last book,
written !n Reading jail, is just about
to be published. It is said to be his
literary last will and testament and is
called "De Profundis."
"Charley's Aunt" has now a total
of 121,560 performances to its credit,
which, it is said, is a greater- number
than any other play ever has attained.
After fifteen years the acting rights,
which were acquired in the beginning
by W. H." Penley, have Just reverted
to the author, Brandon Thomas, who
has celebrated the occasion by reviv
ing the piece at the Comedy â where
"His Highness r My Husband" recently
gave up the ghost; In consequence of
Penley's illness the part of Lord Fan
court Babberly is being played at the
Comedy by Stanley. Cooke. who has
acted it in the provinces for several
years, while the author' himself plays
his old part of Colonel Sir Francis
Chesney.
Dr. Richard Strauss, who seems to
have conquered his critics and to be
considered now as the greatest of liv
ing composers, ia tremendously rushed
at present. Besides his duties as
chief conductor 1 of the Royal Opera in
Berlin he has conducted fifteen con
certs within the last three weeks. His
only appearance in London this year
was on December 19 with the Qtfeen's
Hall orchestra and in which his own
works were the principal feature.
Obviously "Everyman," the old
morality play, which has attracted so
much attention in London and the
; United States, was destined to be pro
duced as a cantata.. It was Introduced
to London in this form this week
with painstaking and often admirable
music : by Dr. Walford , Davies, and
with a success sufficient to. warn the
critics that the cantata will soon be
heard in the United States. .â .".

COURSE AND SPECTATORS CHEER AS THE RICH STAKE IS WON BY CLAUDE
CLAUDE IN FRONT FROM START TO FINISH
IN THE CHRISTMAS HANDICAP AT OAKLAND
Military Man Is a Good Second, While Leila Takes the Show Honors
Record-Breaking Throng Crosses the
Bayâ Four Favorites Beaten.
Turing up to his reputation as the
holiday king:, M. J. Daly's Claude, car
rying 127 pounds and ridden by Willie
Daly, captured the Christmas Handi
cap over on? and a quarter miles yes
terday at Oakland track.
Trie great son of LJscak is a sort of
matinee idol and the vast gathering
of sport lovere. the biggest of recent
years, for more than 12.000 people
\ iewed the contest, cheered wildly as
"i lie bay horse passed the judges an
easy winner over Military Man and
I^iJa. Elliott, the stable companion
â¢<kf Claude, with John Bullman up, ran
4'ourth. The stake was one of the rich
est of the season, as the winner re
ceived $34T0. the second $600 and the
third Sl'SO.
While beauty and fashion held full
â way in the grandstand and on the
clubhouse - lawn, only brawn and
muscle had a chance in the betting
ring. Spacious as the bookmakers'
realm at the track over the baj- is,
it Â»as inadequate to accommodate the
surging mass which filled it yesterday.
BETTING RIXG IS PACKED.
A week-kneed individual figured a
100 to I chance' to jget a full one at
the orices, and to mnke a circuit of
Ihe twenty-nine books was about as
soft a task as it is to drive a knitting
RMdte through a burglar-proof safe
with a sack of flour. Some of the
. la'y-rs" fattened up on the public's
offering*, while others quit with bank
rÂ«-11:> tTiat needed sterilizing, even
though four favorites were laid away.
'If Claude could have been counted
out the ring woold have won a for
tune. Juit "Mike" Daly's horse was un
beatable. Coupled with Elliott the
Daly pair, at one time 7 to 10, closed
Â«ith even money obtainable. As Bull
man rod" Elliott and Willie Daly
"iriaude, the iÂ»encilers calculated the
fctab'lc would try to win with the for
inrr. For this reason eyn money
o*>uld bÂ«> had aboul Claude for the
jÂ»lare and 1 to 2 that he wouldn't
show. Walter Jennings was repre
sented by Gold Money only and the
mare received considerable support at
K' and 1" lo 1. Military Man was sec
ond choice and of the other starte*:,
th'ere being nine in all. Bombardier
received the most attention.
CliUDE nOXEERS THE WAY.
â  Jake Holtman sent the bunch away
to a pup^rb etart within a minute af
ter 'Inlng up at the barrier. Before
reachtng the stand Willie Daly had
urKÂ«H Claud** to the front. Davis was ,
Feoond with Military Man, and there
is the race. Military Man could not ;
extend the leader and Claude simply ;
made his own pace and won like a
wild horp* in 2:08, a remarkably fine
performance over a track heavy and
inclined to be cuppy. Ten lengths be
hind. Military Man Leila finished third.
Both the favorite, Edgecliff, and the
Â«Â«*cond choice. Baker, were led over â¢
-tfco finishing line in the opening six
a Â»jÂ«i a half furlong sprint for two
yptr-olds by M. A. Powell, the third
choice. The winner had W. Davis in
the saddle and, in front from the start,
was never headed. Sam Greenfield
fmlshed second on Edgecliff, more
than a length ahead of Baker.
.Sir Proton made a ift-etty favorite
"n paper for the six-furlong run fol
lowing, but bis showing In the race
was .disgraceful. Travers, who rode
him v managed' to find all the poor
footing and finished unplaced. Davis,
astride the 5 to 1 chance. Educate,
timed his_ mare just right and. catch
fng Helgesen on Brennus all in, won
by nearly a length. Profitable ran
t-ljird. '
TOCOLAW'S POOR LUCK.
. "Big Bill" Knapp, on Tocolaw, fa
vorite for the purse event at six fur
longs, met with decidedly poor rac
ing luck throughout- Right after the
start he was caught in a jam and was
forced to pull up, after which in an
endeavor to save ground "Big Bill"
and his mount got in the deep going.
His chances were ruined early and he
finished fourth. The winner turned
up in Judge, one of the second
choices, with which Michaels reached
the wire first, a length ahead of Ma
rrane. Always prominent, Rowena
took the show at odds of 20 to 1.
Travers broke it up again in the
inile and a sixteenth selling fixture,
with Isabellita, another favorite. He
*ot away from the post badly and the
mare finished among the "also rans."
Anvil, an S to 1 chance, piloted by
Wright, which on last Saturday was
Wt at the post, went out in the lead
and won all the way. Dungannon, the
second choice, made a game bid for
it in the stretch, but could not quite
get up. losing by less than a length.
Wenrick. at odds of 16 to 1, ran into
the show. Grafter, a supposed good
thing, finished last.
With his known fancy for a heavy
track. Dr. Leggo looked to outclass
his company in the mile run for two
year-olds and at 7 to 10 the colt re
ceived stanch backing. He was rid
den by Bonner and. after a slight
shaking up, caught the pacemaker, A.
Muskoday, scoring with apparent
ease. Lloyd Fountain took show hon
ors with Hooligan.
TRACK NOTES.
The stewards will hold a meeting
this evening at the rooms of the
Jockey Club. 23 Kearny street. The
running of the horse W. R. Condon
will be investigated. Sonje queeirlook
ing rides of Jockey Helgesen will als.i

ball at Ninth and Bryant streets
grounds. The game was well played
on both sides and many fast and clever
move? were executed. Each team had
a delegation of rooters on hand to cheer
them on. The final score was 12 to 0.
The Columbia team appeared to have
the advantage in weight. It opened the
game with a dash, and before many
minutes had elapsed. Gorman succeeded
in putting the ball over the goal line
for the Columbias. Before the expira
tion of the first half Brannagel scored
another touchdown. Gorman suc
ceeded in kicking the goals*.
During the last half the Telegraph
Hill players took a brace. They kept
the ball constantly in their opponents'
territory and were several times %vith
in a few feet of scoring, but they could
not go through the defense line of their
opponents for a touchdown. The clever
work of Patsy Cornyn in affording his
team mates interference was a feature
of the game. Following is the line-up:

ETHYLENE CAPTURES
HOLLYWOOD HANDICAP
Brown Daughter of Freeman Is
an Outsider in the Betting.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 26.â A holiday
crowd of at leaat 9000 people went to
Ascot to-day and " the twenty u joks
had all they could do to handle the
volume of money. The card -was a
splendid one, the weather was clear
and the' track lightning: fast. One track
record was cut materially, Ethylene
clipping: off l\i seconds in the big race
of the day. Two favorites won and
the public lost a lot of money or. the
day. â 
The sport opened with the success of
Happy Chappy, a 10 to 1 shot, in the
first race, the favorite, Funnyside,
finishing: second and Rag Tag, heavily
played, third. The second .went to
Luckett, the favorite, in fast time, The
Major second and John P third.
The Hollywood handicap, at one and
a sixteen miles, with a gross value of
$1810, was third on the card and hj.d
seven starters. Fi^e scratches rather
upset the calculations of the form stu
dents. The public made Princess Tu
lane, Fossil, High Chancellor and Mil
ton Young almost equal favorite.
Blissful was an added starter and was
played to finish just inside the monev.
Ethylene could be had at 7 and 8 to 1.
Ethylene set the pace from the start,
with Fossil always a close second and
Milton Young, Blissful and Chancellor
a few lengths back. The first mile
was run In 1:39k, Ethylene maintaining
an even pace all the way â  and finishing
a length ahead of Fossil. Tulane came
fast In the stretch and finished third.
The time was 1:45%, a record for the
Ascot track-

on Sunday was finished and a number
of continuous tournament matches
were played. As was expected George
Janes and Melville Long carried off the

handily.

sets easily. Jones and Rolfe took a
brace in the third set and won it 6-4.

nell, the No. 1 man. Janes' rise in the
tennis world has been meteoric.
The semi-final match between Ray
Splivalo and Chester Smith and Paul
Jones and Harry Rolfe was exceeding
ly close. Smith and Splivalo won the
first set easily and looked like sure win
ners. As on the previous day Rolfe
and Jones put up a strong finish and
just nosed out their opponents.
The other semi-final match was won
in straight sets by Janes and Long.
Their opponents, Frank Mitchell and
Bradley Wallace, made a good showing
in the first set but stood no chance In
the second. Mitchell put up a good
game, but Janes and Long played
everything to Wallace, who was some
what outclassed.
In the continuous tournament W. B.
Collier, No. 3. beat Ray Cornell, No. 2,
in three straight sets. Collier played
a steady game and won on his oppo
nent's errors.
W. G. Knowlton established a record
for continuous tournament play. He
played four matches yesterday and won
them all. Twice he defended and twice
he advanced a number.
Al Kenyon went up* a number when
he beat Moulten Warner. The match
was close and went threesets. The

TITUS. THE CRACK SCULLER,
MAY MEET -ALEX PAPE HERE
The American Amateur Ex-Champion
Is Anxious for a Race on Lake .
'j!crritt Waters.
NEW YORK, Dec. 26. â Constance
S. Titus, ex-champion amateur scul
ler of America, stated positively to
day that he would go to the Pacific
Coast to race Pape and Glass. He
also stated that he had not abandoned
the idea of going to Australia.. He
said:
"I have made all arrangements for
a trip to Australia in February, but I
would go to the Pacific Coast to row
Al Pape on Lake Merritt, near San
Francisco.' and would stop on my way
at Portland, Or., to meet Ed Glass if
matches could be arranged. '
"These two men are- the fastest
scullers on the coast and I would like
to race either of them. Despite the
opinion of scullers on the coast that
no- Easterner can go out there and
defeat their champions, I feel confi
dent I would defeat at least one of
them."
The two-year-old race furnished tha
biggest surprise of the day, Bologna,
at 23 to 1, winning easily from Sand
stone, with Belle Kinney third. Blue
ccat, Tramotor and El Otros, the threa
heavily played horses, failed to get in

LOS ANGELES. Dec. 26.â The Sher

feating the Nevada University foot
ball team at Fiesta Park this afternoon
by the score of 23 to 5. The Nevadana
put up a fast, snappy game for about
fifteen minutes and then seemed to lose
their ginger. â  The Indians showed to
better advantage in almost every phase
of the game. .

HELD BY WOMAN
Mrs. T. Lundy, Wliile Board
ing Crowded Car, Catches
Man Acting Suspiciously
PRISONER -IS SEARCHED
Believed to Have Passed Her
Purse to Confederate Pos
ing as Special Detective
A daring: piece of pickpocket work
was accomplished yesterday afternoon
on a beach car about to leave the cor
ner of Fourth and Stevenson streets
and Henry E- Wisherd Is lodged at the
City Prison on a charge of grand lar
ceny. The complainant is Mrs. T.
Lundy of 947 Stanyan street, wife of
the jeweler, who has a store in the Call
building.
Mrs. Lundy, accompanied by her hus
band and her son, Arthur Dundy, was
boarding a beach car amid a Jostling
crowd that was attempting to get
seats. While on the rear platform of
the car Mrs. Lundy felt herself vio
lently thrust forward and at the same
time Arthur Lundy remonstrated with
Wisherd, but as the latter apologized
nothing more was thought of the oc
currence.
A minute later Mrs. Lundy dis
covered that her purse containing $30
â was gone and the peculiar actions of
Wisherd directed suspicion to him. Ac
cording to Arthur Lundy Wisherd had
gone to the front of the ear, then
jumped off and was standing on the
curb.
Mrs. Lundy ran toward Wisherd and
seizing him by the arm accused him of
stealing* her purse. He made no at
tempt to break away but appeared to
be hesitating about making any state
ment beyond the fact that she had
made a mistake. Suddenly, according
to Mrs. Lundy, Wishera exclaimed,
"Well, take me into the store here and
search me."
As the party entered the store a
short man dressed in a * long ulster
coat pushed through the crowd, threw
back his coat showing 1 a star and
claimed to be a special detective. He
made a hasty examination of the pris
oner and announced that there was no
purse on him and suggested that he be
released.
At this juncture Mr. Lundy returned'
with Policemen Driscoll and McQuaide,
who took Wisherd into custody- When
the policemen arrived the man claim
ing to be the special officer disappeared.
The Lundys believe that this man was
a confederate and obtained possession
of the purse.
Wisherd was a taken to the Fourth
and Clara streets station and when
searched no purse was found on him.
He said he was a bartender and lately
arrived from New York and that he
lived on Geary street.

E. F. Phelan, 921 Polk street,
found a lady's hand satchel yesterday
on Devisaderp street, near Fulton, and
took it to police headquarters. It con
tained about $1000 worth^of diamond
jewelry and S5 75 in cash. The name
and address, ''Mrs. O. F. Grundel, 1911
Eddy street," were engraved on the
satchel, and Property Clerk Dlnan
telephoned to Mrs. Grundel. Her hus
band hurried to headquarters and'was
overjoyed at recovering his wife's
property. When Phelan was asked
what reward would be adequate he re
plied that he did not want anything
personally, but if Grundel felt inclined
to give anything he could make a
donation to the Little Sisters of the
Poor. Grundel said he would do so.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 27, 1904.
LIVE LECTURE
TO BE GIVEN
Jacob Riis, the American j
Saronarola, to Talk ' for j
Benefit of Delinquent Tykes '
INTERESTS CLUBWOMEN !
Address Will Be Under the
Auspices of the Civic Sec
tion of California Club
By Laura Bride Powers.
As an element in the betterment of
civic conditions in San Francisco, the
California Club's a trump!
It works along educational, social
science and civic lines and these de
partments of activity are pigeon-holed
off into a half-hundred sections, run
ning from harmony to hospitals.
Now, the civic section of the club was
the fond progenitor of the juvenile
court, agitating its worth and assisting
vitally in the passage of 'laws making
it a possibility.
But the question of financing it was
left largely in the air â and purposely â
that there would be no valid reason for
the bill's defeat.
For two years the California Club,
with other humane individuals and or
gariizations. has been contributing a
tax for the salaries of the probationary
officers. That this great work, should
have to depend upon philanthropy is
lamentable, but- at this time such is
the case until the Board of Supervisors*
make a suitable provision for its main
tenance in May â which every right
thinking man and woman In all the city
should rise up and demand. Then will
the board gladly comply, since it is
made up of men who recognize the
value to the government of the intelli
gent guidance of delinquent children. ;
That funds shall be available for the
good work, the civic section of the
California Club has induced Jacob Riis,
the deliverer of children in New York
slums, to talk UDpn his chosen work.
The lecture will be given at the Al- '
hambra, Monday evening, January . 9,
and the distinguished visitor will tell
about "Tony," a real waif of the Got
ham streets, and will demonstrate his
talk with stereopticon views of Tony's
hard lot. !
This man Rils is a wonder! He has '
been a moral derrick for the poor in the
tenements of his city, demonstrating
how a stout heart and a strong mind,
bent on a human errand, can change
conditions that a century of false living
had wrought. i
The following terse recital of the so
cial revolution brought about by this
erstwhile reporter is an epitome of his
labors:
It was RHs â who forced the destruction of
rear tenements, and thus relieved the hideous
darkntss and density of life among the poor.
It was the reporter with his nagging: that
wiped out Mulberry Bend, the worst tenement
block in the city, and had the space turned
Into a park. Rlls spoke the word that Incited
Commissioner Roosevelt to abolish police sta
tion lodging-houses. Riis fought for and se
cured a truant school, where boys who play
hooky are disciplined â they used to be impris
oned with juvenile criminals. Rile did the work
that won email narks for bad spots In the
city: he labored years for enough schools;
he drove bakeshops with their fatal flreÂ« out
of tenement basements; he demanded llpht
for dark tenement hallways, got It, and thus
opened one hiding-place of vice, crime and
filth. He worked for the - abolition of child
labor, and, when a law was enacted, com
pelled Its enforcement. Playgrounds for
schools and the opening of schoolrooms to
boys" and girls' clubs were of his. work.. And
he raised the cry for flowers for the healthy
as well as The sick poor.
Now, such a man is worth seeing.
Likewise is he worth hearing, if for no
more than to demonstrate the power
for good that lies in one heart, one
head and one pair of hands. â¢ !
And don't forget, in hearing this
American Savonarola, that the proceeds
of the lecture planned by the Calif or- ,
nia Club's civic section will be devoted â 
to the very things that Jacob Riis has \
done elsewhere, and that must be done j
in San Francisco, unhampered by - a
paucity of pennies.
Remember the date, January 9, and
the place, the Alhambra Theater.
You're going?.

Presbyterian Ministers' Association,
made a revelation.
Mr. Laughlin until recently was a
missionary in China, where also, ia
Mrs. Herring, an ardent worker in the
missionary field. It transpired that
Elijah III has been a-casting pam
phlets aboard citing the case of his
miraculous cure of a child named Rey
in Sydney, Australia, Dowle giving the
case as the one where the first knowl
edge of his power as a healer was re
vealed to him by God.
"The story as told by Mrs. Herring,
a sister of Miss Rey," said Mr. Laugh
lm, "is that many years >ago Dowle in
his capacity as pastor visited the Rey
family, which was in sore distress
through; the illness of the child. The
girl had been unconscious for some
time.} Mrs. Herring admits that Alex-,
ander Dowie prayed at the bedside, but
she says that the burden of prayer was.
not that the child should recover, but
that divine consolation might be
granted the family "who would be be
reaved in the event Ct death. He had
no hope of the child's recovery, Mrs.
Herring says, as VasT evidenced by the
fact that when he left the sorrowing
household and was asked by neighbors
concerning the little one's condition
he replied that she was dying and^
even - by " that time had probably de
parted this "life.
"Mrs. Herring relates that after, his
leaving the house her mother placed
the girl in a hot bath and wrapped her,
up in blankets as a. last hope. ; This,
caused the patient to breathe easier
and she woke â¢' to. consciousness^.
Coupled with this there' had been a
change of physicians just' prior to
Dowie's visit, followed by a complete
change also in treatment.
"Mrs. Herring, said the family never
thought -of attributing the recovery to
a- 'miraculous healing' . in answer to*
prayer apart from the use of medical
treatment. â  Indeed, the family was
astonished to see*. that Dowie had at
tributed the recovery to the influence
of his prayer ', or 'divinely given
power.' "
â¢..The; Rev.-Mr. Fisk showed pictures
taken of Dowie and ... the ; tabernacle, i
The latter picture shows 5000 persons
attending service at .6 o'clock in the
morning. On January 9 '. Mr. Fisk will
read ia paper before, 1 the association
dealing with Zion City.

SORROW COMES
AFTER REVELRY
After the feasting and rejoicing the
Christmastide brought t death and
mourning into the home of Frank Mc-
Donough at 951 Harrison street yester
day morning. When the tapers on the
Christmas tree in the parlor ware re
lighted and preparations- begun for the
morning meal, the master of the house
was found cold In death. Then the
lights were extinguished, the wreaths
of holly berry taken out of the front
windows and crape was substituted as
mute' witness, that a skeleton Nemesis
hides behind the garlands of every
feast.
McDonough and his wife gave a par
ty on Sunday night to fourteen friends.
A young redwood tree was in the front
room 1 lighted with tapers of various
colors and scintillating with gilded bon
bons.: Around the tree were strewn
on the carpet gifts brought by the in
vited guests. The dining-room and
parlor were festooned with evergreens
and heavy with the fragrance of flow
ers. The long table, decorated with
smilax, holly, calla lilies and roses, was
laden with the' good things of the
feast. Wine cheered the guests, and
the night resounded with revelry.
Frank McDonough succumbed early
to the tempting conditions, and his.
wife placed him on a couch In the.
kitchen and made him comfortable for
the night. Shortly after/ midnight the
party retired. Mrs. McDonough sleep
ing in her own room with a lady friend
from Oakland. At five minutes past 7
o'clock yesterday morning Mrs. Mc-
Donough went into the kitchen .to
arouse her husband. She found th<*
room full of illuminating gas, and her
husband cold in death. The dead man's
elder brother, who slept upstairs, was
hurriedly aroused. The odor of the
gas was strong in his room also. Ho
was almost overcome by. ithe* poison,
and he was dressed in quick haste and
was rushed . outside into the cold air
and caused to walk about for half an
hour. A roomer named J. " Ty rell, ' who
lodged~"on the same floor as 'the elder
brother, was also found* almost uncon
scious from the gas that had come up
through the floor .' from the kitchen."
The same treatment \yas given him as
| had been given the other man and he
soon recovered. The elder McDonough
was ' so weak when he returned from
his - walk that he fainted.
The gas fixture In the kitchen has
two keys, one of which admits *as to
a small heating stove, the other to the
burner for light. Two burned matches
lying on the floor and* a half eaten pie
on the table showed how ths accident
had occurred. McDonough had arisen
during the night, turned the gas^key
of the stove and placed the match to
the light burner. Being unable to pro
duce a flame he struck another match,
turned the other key and lighted the
burner, forgetting to turn off the sup
ply to the stove. After eating the pie
he turned out the light and went
to sleep, the deadly fluid meanwhile
pouring out from the stove.
McDonough had been employed as
clerk in J. J. McCann/s grocery and bar
at "919 Harrison street. He was a na
tive of Ireland, 43 years old.
