field?" ,. Â£ Â¦ ....... - .
VWe are Tdoihg business there, and
you have "the Argus to thank for it.
Youâ or your, idea, I should say â has a
respectable following all over the
State now; 'as It didn't have until we
began to leg. for it."
I Again Kent . acquiesced, making no
mention of sundry journeys . he had
made for the sole purpose of enlisting
other editors, or of the open house
Miss Van "Brock -was keeping for out
of-town- newspaper men visiting the
capital.
"Moreover, we've served your turn
in the Transwestern affair," Hildreth
went on. "Public interest is on the qui
viva for new developments in that. By
the .way, has the capitol gang any no
tion of your part in all this upstlr
rlng?"
Kent" smiled . and handed the editor
an open letter. . It was from Receiver
Guilford. The post of general counsel
for the Transwestern was vacant, and
the'. letter was a formal tender of the
office to the ''Hon. David Kent."
,"H'm," said the editor. "I don't un
derstand that a little bit."
â¢ "if Â¦ they could get you to accept a
general agency . In Central Africa or
New Zealand, or some other antipodean
place where you'd be safely out of the
way, it. would be evident enough. But
here they, are proposing to take you
right into the heart of things."
Kent got a match out of the editor's
desk and relighted his cigar.
'.'You've got brain-fag to-night, Hil
dreth. It's a bribe, pure and simple.
They argue that it is merely a matter
of dollars and cents to me, as it would
be to one of. them; and they propose
.to retain me Just as they would any;
other attorney whose opposition they
might want to get rid of. Don't you
see?"
"Sure. I was thinking up the wrong
spout.' HaVe you replied to the ma
jor? 1 , 1 â¢ . Â¦ Â¦
. "Yes. I told him my. present en
gagements preclude the possibility of
considering his offer; much to my re
gret."
"Did you. say that? You're a cold
plucked One, Kent, and I'm coming -to
admire you." But now is the time for
you to begin to look out. They have
spotted you, and their attempt to buy
you has failed/ I don't know how
deeply you have gone into Bucks' tin
kering with the Universal people, but
if you are In the way of getting the
grip you spoke ofâ as this letter seems
to indicate â you want to be careful."
Kent promised and went his way.
One of his saving graces was the abil
ity to hold his tongue, even In a confi
dential talk with as good a friend as
Hlldfeth. As for example: he had let
the suggestion of watching the Sec
retary of, State's office come as a new
thing from the editor, whereas In fact
it was one of the earliest measures he
had taken. > <
And on that road he had traveled
far, thanks to a keen wit. to Portia
Van Brock's incessant promptings, and
to the help of the leaky clerk In Hen
dricks'; oflice: . so far. indeed. . that he
had found : the "stool pigeon" oil com

Kent could no longer say truthfully
that It was, and he did not lie about it.
"No, it's purely personal, I guess. I
need to get a grip j on Bucks and I
mean to do it." *
Hildreth laughed.
"And having got it, you'll telephone
me to let upâ as you did in the House

"No; you shall come in on the ground

The night editor sat back in his chair
and chewed his cigar reflectively. Sud
denly he asked: . â¢
"What's your â¢ object, Kent? It
isn't* purely ,prq bono publico, ; I take

open secret that the Universal . people
are trying to break through the fence
of the new law and establish .them
selves â¢ in the Belmount field without
losing their identity or any of their
monopplistic privileges. Â¦. And it is
equally a matter of course to some of
U3 that the Bucks ring will sell the
State out if the price Is right. But to
Implicate Bucks and the capitol gang
in printable shape is quite anotther
matter.'!"
"I'd like to give that mind â¢ a stunt
on the , Argus," said the editor. Â¦ "But
about the. Belmount. mix-up: you- will
give us a- stickful now and then as" we
go along, if you unearth anything that
the public would like to read?"
"Certainly; any and every thing that
won't tend to interfere with my little
Intermediate scheme. As I have inti
mated, I must bring Bucks to terms on
my own. account^ before I turn him
over to. you and the people of the State.
But I mean to.be in on that, too." V
Hildreth wagged his head dubiously.
"I may be overcautious, and I dftn't
want to seem to scare you out, Kent.
You j ought" to; know your man better
than I doâ better, than any of ,us; - but
if I had your job I believe I should
want to travel with a"bodyguard. I do,
for a fact." ...
David Kent's laugh came easily.
Fear, the fear of man; was not among
his weaknesses. : , .:
, "I am - taking, all the, chances," he
eaid; and- so the conference ended.
Two days later, the. "editorial" cam
paign .was . opened -by an editorial in
the Argus setting, forth' some hitherto
unpublished 'matter concerning. :the
manner in which the Trans western had
been placed in the' hands of a receiver.
In its next issue the paper named the
receivership after Its true . author,
showing by a list of the officials that

been made a hospital for Bucks politi
cians; and hinting pointedly, that it was
to be wrecked for the benefit of a stock--

pitched upon the efforts of the Univer

was promptly taken up by^other State

closely by- others , in the same, strain,

In- conclusion. > '.It is all inference and

"Kent, did you fuf-flgure all that out

"You know I haven't, It's a stark

"And the people of the State are en

the long tyranny of the oil monopoly
will be broken?" .
"That is the way most of the news
papers talk, and there seems to ba
some little ground for it, granting the
powers of the new law." -
She laid the tips of her fingers on
his arm and knotted the thread of sug
gestion in a single* sentence. i
"In the present state of affairsâ with

the public mind ready ttt take fire at

"By Jove!" Kent exclaimed, sitting
up as if the shapely hand had given
him a buffet. "It would ruin him polit

She laughed softly.

"Then I can go to his Excellency, and

Her words fired him curiously. He
recalled the little thrill of inspiration
which a somewhat similar appeal from
Elinor had once 'given him, and tried
to compare the two sensations. There
was no comparison. The one was a
call to a moral .victory; the other to
material success/ None the less, he
decided that the present was the more
potent spell, perhaps only because It
was the present.. .
"Try me." he said . impulsively.
"If I do f. . . David, no man can
serve thro masters â or two mistresses.
If I do, will you agree to put the senti

He took his head in his hands and
was a long minute making up his mind.
But the refusal was blunt enough
when It came. .^%&8&pRBpB8BB .
"No; at least not until they are mar

It would have ; taken a keener/ dis

\"Maybe ; I; can: or "rather, * maybe I

could help, with Portia's eyes demand
ing it
"It was that at first, I'll admit It
But latterlyâ" . â¢
"Latterly you have bsgun to think
larger things?" She 'looked away from
him, and her next word seemed to be
patr of an unspoken thought. "I have
been wondering If you are great
enough, David."
He shook his head despondently.
"Haven't I Just been, showing you
that I am nof?"
"You have been showing me that you
cannot always outplan the other per
son. That is a lack, but it Is not fatal.
Are you great enough to run fast and
far,, when It is a stralght-away race
depending only upon mere' man
strength and Indomitable determina
tion?"
he said he would take the matter un
der advisement: I knew that meant a*
consultation with Bucks. Then I put
the whip on; told him a few things I
know, and let -him Imagine a lot more;
but it was no good. He was as
smooth as oil, admitting nothing, deny
ing nothing. And what grinds me
worst Is that I let him put me in fault;
gave him a chance to show conclusive
ly how absurd it was for me to expect
him to take up a question of such mag
nitude on the spur of the moment."
"Of course," she said sympathetical
ly. "I knew they would find a way.
What are you doing?"
Kent laughed In spite of his sore
amour-propre.
"At this present moment I am doing
precisely what you said I should; un
loading my woes upon you."
"Oh. but I didn't say that. â¢ I said
you would come to me for help. Have
you?"
"I'd say yes, If I didn't know so well
just what I am up against."
Miss Van Brock laughed unfeelingly.
"Is it a man's weakness to fight bet
ter In the dark?"
"It is a man's common sense to know
when he is knocked out," he retorted.
She held him with her eyes while she
said:
"Tell me . what you want to accom
plish, David: at the end of the ends, I
mean. Is it only that you wish to
save Miss Brentwood's little marriage
portion?" *
"And you couldn't?" she said.
'â¢'Not in a thousand years. At . first
"X don't mind your saying 'I told you
so'." he fumed.' . "It's the fact that I
didn't have sense enough to see what
an easy, game I was dealing them. - ' It

At the moment of this sayingâ it was
between ten and eleven o'clock at night
David 'Kent's wrath-fire was far from
needing an additional stoking. Once
more Miss Van Brock had given proof
of her prophetic gift, and Kent had
been moodily filling details of th.e pic
ture drawn by her woman's intuition.
He had gone late to the house in Ala
meda square, knowing that Portia had
dinner guests. And it was Imperative
that he should have her to himself.
"You needn't tell me * anything but
the manner of its doing," she was say
ing- "I knew they, would find a way
to stop youâ Â©t make tone. And you
needn't be spiteful at me," she added,
when Kent gripped the arms of his
chair. Â¦ Â¦â¢*Â¦' ; --'-' tiggS
The onlooker leaned from his window
to see what became of the tangle of
horses and autocar precipitated by the
eudden stop of the tally-ho. -Mirage ef
fects are common on the*vrestern plains
and if Ormsby had not Deen familiar
with them he might have marveled at
the striking example afforded by the
backward look. In the rapidly increas
ing perspective the six horses of the
tally-ho were suddenly multiplied into
a. troop and where the station us?nt
had stood on the platform there seemed
to be a dozen gesticulating figures fad
ing into indistinctness as the fast train
swept on its way eastward.
The clubman saw no more of the
junketing party' that nigat. Once when
the train stopped to cut out the din
ing-car and he had stepped down for
a breath of fresh air on the station
platform, he ' noticed that the private
car was brilliantly lighted and that the
curtains and window shades were
closely drawn. Also he heard the pop
ping, of bottle corks and the clink of
glass, betokening that i the Governor's
party was still celebrating- its success
ful, race for the train.- Singularly
enough Ormsby's reflections concerned
themselves chiefly with the small dis
honesty. . .
"I suppose It all goes Into the receiv
er's.expense account and the railroad
pays for it/! he said to himself. "So
and so much for an inspection trip to
Megilp and return. I must tell -Kent
About it. It will, put another shovel
ful of coal into . bis furnace â not that
he is especially needing it."-
Ormsby had settled back into the
coiner of his section when he heard
the splitting explosions of the automo
bile and Â«the crash of hoofs and iron
tired wheels on the sharp gravel. He
looked out again and was in time to
see the finish of the race. Up the
road from the westward came the six
horse tally-ho, the horses galloping in
the traces and the automobile strain
ing in the lead at the end of an im
provised tow-line. In a' twinkling the
coach was abreast of the private car,
tha transfer of passengers was ef
fected, and Ormsby was near enough
at his onlooking window to remark
several things; that there was pell
mell haste and suppressed excitement;
that the Governor was the coolest man
in the group and that the receiver had
to be helped across from the coach
to the car. Then the train moved out,
gathering speed with each added wheel
turn. - Â¦ â¢
Ormsby put his head out of the win
dow and saw that the private car was
to be taken on; remarked also that the
thing was done with the utmost ceje
rity. Once out on the main line with
car Naught-seven co-upled in, the train
was backed swiftly down to the sta
tion and the small mystery of hurry
ings was sufficiently solved. The Go\"
ernor and his party were returning,
and they did not wish to miss connec
tions.
Curiosity is said to be peculiarly a
foible feminine. If is not. .as every
one knows. But of the major mascu
line allotment, Ormsby the masterful
had rathÂ«r less than his due share.
He saw the chauffeur turn his car in
the length of it and send it spinning
down the road and across the line into
the adjoining State; heard the mel
low whistle of the incoming train ana
saw the station man nervously setting
his stop signal; ail with no more than
a mild desire to- know the reason
for so much excitement and haste â a
desire which was content to wait on
the explanation .of events.
The exolanation. such as it was. did
not linger. The heavy train thundered
in from the west; stopped barely long
enough to allow the single passenger
i" swing up the steps of the Pullman;
and went on again to stop a second
time with a jerk when it had passed
the side-track switch. â¢â¢

THIS left the listener out of It
completely and Ormsby strolled
out to the platform, wondering
what had happened and where
It had happened. He glanced up at
the telephone wires; two of them ran
up ths graveled' driveway toward
Breeze land Inn: the poles of the other
two sentineled the road to the west
down which the tally-ho had driven in
the early morning.
In the reflective instant the tele
graph ODcrator dashed out of his bay
window retreat and ran ud the track
to the private car. In a few minutes
he was back again,, holding an excited
conference with, the chauffeur of the
inn automobile, who was waiting to
see if the flyer should bring him any
fares for the hotel.
"Lord Bacon said that, didn't he?â
about men marrying^ If he were alive
now he. wouldn't need to say it. Men
don't have to be discouraged."
"Don't they?" said Kent. 'â*/:>.
/"No, Indeed: the- are too utterly
selfish for any matrimonial use. as It is.
No, don't argue with me. please. I'm
fixed â irrevocably fixed." /.'
Elinor .overtook the runaway conver
sation and drove it back into the path
of her own choosing.
â¢/But 'I 'do think you owe It to your
self to be more careful in your publio
utterances." she insisted. "If these
men on the other side are only half as
unt>rlncipled as your accusations make
""What does a man â a real manâ care
for that?" This from the /depths of
the hammock.
"I, at least, can afford to be care
less." said Kent . "I am not running
for office, and I have nothing to lose,
politically or otherwise.**
"Can any man say that truthfully V
Elinor queried. " t
"I think I can. I have given no>
hostages to fortune."
Penelope lifted the challenge proxnpt-
"I am glad you won for the league,
of course; everybody must be glad of
that," she said. "But I hope the Argus
didn't report your speeches correctly.
If it did, you have made a host of bit
ter enemies."
On the porch of the Brentwood apart
ment house David Kent was answering
that question measurably well for him
self. With the striking of the City Hall
clock at nine Mrs. Brentwood had com
plained of the glare of. the electrio
crossing lamp and had gone in. leaving
the caller with Penelope In the ham
mock on one side of Â¦ him and Elinor
In a basket chair on the other.
Their talk had been of the lats muni
cipal struggle, and of Kent's part In
It; and. like Miss Van Brock, Penelope
was applausive. But Elinor's congrat
ulations were tempered with depreca
tion.
"I said I was willing to hÂ»Ip Kiat
If you bracket yourself with him. I am
more than willing. But I am rather
new at the game. You will have to tell
me the moves."
"We are only hi the opening/* she
said, continuing the figure. "You will
learn as you go along. : By and by you
will have to spend money; but Just
now the need Is for a cool head to
keep our young firebrand out of the
personalities. Where is he to-night?"
Ormsby's smile was a grin.
"I left him at 124 Tejon avÂ«nue half
an hour ago. Do you think he is likely
to get Into trouble there?"
"There was no confidence needed,**
she retorted. . "I have ' eyes; and, to
us3 one of your own pet phrases, I wu

you are willing to help us?"
Figuratively speaking. Portia stood
in the wings and applauded.. Also,
she saw that her protege had reached
the point where he needed grooming: for
whatever race lay before him. ; Hence,
her urgings, which made a triumvirate
out of the council of two, with Brookes
Onnsby as the third member.
"You understand, I'm not Interested
a little bit In the- merits of the case,"
said the newly elected chairman. In
his first official interview with : Miss
Van Brock. "So far as the Internal
politics of this particularly wild and
woolly State are concerned. I*m neither
in them nor of them. But I am willing
to do what I can for Kent."
- "Owing him a good turn?" said Per*
tla, with malice aforethought.
Ormsby*s laugh was an Englishman's
deep-chested haw-haw.
"So he has been making: yon his con
fidante in that, too, has her"
Into this struggle, as giving him the
chance to front the enemy in a fair
field. David Kent flung himself with
all the ardor of a born fighter. Mass
meetings were held, with Kent as
spokesman for the league, and the out
come was a decency triumph which
brought Kent's name into grateful
public prominence. Hildreth played an
able second, and by the time the ob
noxious ordinance had been safely
tabled, Kent had a semi- political fol
lowing which was all his own. .Men
who had hitherto known htm only as
a corporation lawyer began to proph
esy large things of the fiery young ad
vocate, whose arguments were as
sound and convincing as his Invective
was keen and merciless.
The Conspirator*.
It was chiefly due to Portia's urging*
that Kent took Ormsby into his confi
dence when the campaign was fairly
opened. She put it diplomatically on
the ground of charity to an exiled
millionaire, temporarily out of a job;
but her real reason went deeper. From
its Inception as a one-man fight against
political chicanery In high places; tha
criticism of the Bucks formula was be
ginning to shape itself in a readjust
ment of party lines in the field of State
politics; and Miss Van Brock, whose
designs upon Kent's future ran far in
advance of her admissions to him, was
anxiously casting about for a mana
gerial promoter.
A little practice-play in municipal
politics made the need apparent. It
came in the midst of. things, basing it
self upon the year-gone trlunrph of
agrarianism in the State. In the up
heaval, the capital city had partici
pated to the extent of electing a ma
jority of tiie Aldermen on the People's
party ticket; and before long It devel
oped that a majority of this alder
manic majority could be counted
among the spoilsmenâ was in fact a
creature of the larger ring.
Late in the summer an ordinance
was proposed by the terms of which a
single corporation was to be given a
franchise granting a complete monop
oly of the streets for gas and water
maind* and transit rights of way.
Thereupon a bitter struggle ensued.
Party lines were obliterated, and men
who shunned the primaries and other
wise shirked their political Â¦ duties
raised the cry of corruption, and a
Civic League was formed to fight the
ring.

employing it.
And for the abutments of the arch of

It is"* Question for the psychologists
to answer if there be or be not crises
In a man's life, when the event, weighty
or trivial, turns upon that thing which,
for the want of a better name, is called
a premonition.
Ir^V silence- that followed his dis
xnl>r vt the subject, Kent became
awa . ct a vague prompting which was
urging him to cut his visit short. , There
was no definite reason for his going.
He had finally brougrht himself -to -the
point or speaking openly to Elinor of
her engagement and they were, as he
fondly believed, safely beyond the dan
per point in that field. Moreover. Pe
celope was stirring In her hammock
Kent's gift of. reticence came to his
rescue in time to prevent the introduc
tion of another and rather uncertain
factor into his complicated problem. .
"I can explain it more intelligibly a
little later on; or If I don't, Ormsby
Â¦w-ill. In the meantime, you must. take
my word for it that w.e shall have our
railroad back in due season."
"I am willing to believe that you
have strong reasons , for taking: such
strong measures," she said. "May I
know them?"
It shocked her a little and she did not
promise to be a party to the subter
fuge. But neither did she say she
would not. â¢'
"By keeping ycur own counsel and
trusting me. Your mother supposes
this letter has gone: it has goneâ this
way." He tore the sealed envelope
across and across and dropped the
pieces into his pocket. "Xow we are
safe â &t least until the man at the
other end writes asain."
Miss P.renf.vood rose.
"It was on the hall table this aft
ernoon; 1*11 go and see." and in a mo
ment she returned with the letter in
her ha no.
Kent took It from her as if it had
been an edged weapon or a can of higS
explosives.
"Heavens! What a turn you gave
me!" he suld. sJttine: down again. "Can
I see your mother?"
**I think she has jrone to bed. "What
do you want to do?"
"I want to tell her that she mustn't
do any such suicidal thing as thts."
"You don't know my mother." was
the calm reply. "Mr. Ormsby said
everything he could think of."
"Then we must take matters into our
own hands. Will you help me?"
"How?" the asked.
"Has that letter been mailed? Be
cause, if it has, it must be stopped by
wire!"
"The encouragement comes too late
for us. We have parted with our
stock."
Kent turned cold and hot and cold
again while she was saying it. Then
the lawyer in him came uppermost.
"Is it gone beyond recall? How much
too late am. I?" he demanded.
"My mother wrote the letter to-day
fihe h.-iil an offer from some one in New
York."
Kent whs on his feet instantly.
"I merely wanted to say that we still
have a fighting chance. But ona of
the hard and fast conditions is that
every individual stockholder shall hang
on to his or her holdings like grim
death."
She caught her breath with a little
Casp.
"If you will light your pipe and go
on smuklng. It makes me nervous to
have people hang on the brinlt of
things." .
He lighted his pipe, wondering what
other thing he might do to allay her
nervousness. None the less he would
not go back from his purpose, which
was barrier building.
"I have thought, wholly without war
rant, perhaps, that your loss in this
railroad steal has had something to do
with the postponement of your happi
ccss â and Oz-msby's. Has it.?"
"And if it should have?"
"Thank you." he rejoined, and he
meant it. "What 1 was going to say
touches a matter which I .believe you
haven't confided to any one. May I
talk businc-ss for a few moments?"
"N T o, I think not. You are responsi
ble, in the broader sense at all events.
He did not come West for Penelope's
sake." Then he took the plunge:^,"May
I know when it is to be â or am I to
wait lor my bidding with the other and
more formally invited guests?"
She laughedâ a low little laugh that
lomthow grated on his nerves.
"You sha.ll know â when I know."
"Forgive me." he said quickly. "But
from something Ormsby saidâ"
"He should not have spoken of it; I
have given him no right," she said
coldly.
'"You make me twice sorry: Once if
I am a ireipatser, and again if I have
unwittingly broken a confidence. But
us a friendâ a very old friendâ I - ven
tured â "
She interrupted him again, but this
time her lausb did not hurt him
"Yes. Our friendship antedates Mr
Ormsby; it is old enough to excuse
anything you said â or were going to
cay."
The story as it appeared under the
scare headlines the next morning -was
crisply told- An oil company, had been
formed with. Senator Duvall at Its
head. After its incorporation it was
ascertained that it not only held r op
tions on all the most valuable wells
in the Belmount region, but that its
charter gave it immunity from the law
requiring all corporations to have their
organizations, officers, and operating
headquarters in the State. By the time
the new company was three, days old
It had quietly taken up its options and
was the single big flsh in the pool by
virtue of its having swallowed all the
little ones.
s On the seventh day the conflagration
broke out. The editor, of j the Belnidnt
Refiner was the first- to' smell smoke :
and raise the cry of "Fire!" 'but: by,
midnight the wires were humming with
the news and the enure State v was
ablaze. Â¦- - -. ', â¢ â¢ "//:Â¦â¢ >'
For six days .after.' the '.night of revel
ations Kent dived deep, personally and
by paid proxy, in a. sea of secrecy,'
which, but for the five pregnant min
utes in the doorway of the Governor's
office, might easily have proved fath
omless.

. In spite of his weariness, which was
real enough, Kent was up betimes the
next moraine. Ha had a wire &p-

them out to be, they would not stop
short of personal violence."
"I am not hunting clemency or per-
Eonal Immunity Just now," laughed
Kent. "On the contrary. I am only
anxious to make the score as heavy as
possible. And so far from keeping
prudently in the background, I'll con
fess that I went into this franchise
fight chiefly to let the capitol gang
know who I am and where I stand."
A sudden light came into Elinor's
fyes and burned there steadily. She
was of those who lay votive offerings
upon the shrine of manly courage.
"One part of me approves as much as
another part disapproves." she said
after a time. "I suppose it isn't possi
ble to avoid making political enemies;
but is It needful to turn them into per
sonal enemies?"
He looked at her curiously.
"I am afraid I don't know any mid
dle path, not being a politician," he ob
jected. "And. as for the enmity of th<:se
men, I shall count it an honor to win
it. If I du not win it I shall know I
am not succeeding."
Silence for another little space, which
Miss LJrentwood broke by saying:
"Don't you want to smoke? You
may."
Kent felt in his pocket.
She looked I'list him to the hammock.
"Penelope," she called softly; and when
there was do icsuouse she went to
â¢spread ihe lu^iUiock rus over her sis
ter.
"'You may smoke your pipe." she saM.

SConvlthitendlns his frank deSancs ol
Brookes Onasby and hla declaration of
Intention in the sentimental afL'air, he
had his ovn notions about the sanctity
of a betrothal. Mrs?. Brentwood had
vanished u:id Penelope vÂ» - as asleep in
the batxnmodd Could lie trust himself
to be deevntly loyal to Ormgby if he
should tta;-? Nice nutations of con
science hud not been troubling him
much of late, but this was a new
ground â or if not new, so old that it
had the effect of being new.* *
He let the question go unanswered â
and irtayed. But he was minded to fling
the blÂ£Â£cst barrier he could lay hands
on in the way of possible disloyalty by
saying sx>od things of Ormsby.
"I owe you much for my acquaint
ance u ith him." he said when the sub
ject was fairly introduced. "He has
been all ki::0s of a good friend to me,
and he i>ro:r,ises to be more."
"Isn't your debt to Penelope, rather
than to me?" the returned.
"Oh; how -clumsy!'! said Portia, in
flnesc6ni.;i'Did his, Excellency. Imagine
for a moment T that -any.; one .would; be
deceived by such : a primitive bit of dust
"I found it so, I assure you. So far
as any usable evidence was concerned

merely, my assertion against. their, de

they valued it;at-a' possible, but highly
improbable, j $3000.".
Kent nodded.
Â¦-, 'â¢ *'I had one that night; angel or de
mon, whichever you please. I was
fairly dragged into doing what I did.
When I reached the upper corridor the
door of the public anteroom was ajar
and I heard voices. The outer room
was not lighted, but the door between
it and the Governors private office
was open. I went in and stood 'In that
doorway for as much as five minutes,
I think, and none of the four men sit
ting around the Governor's writing ta
ble saw. me."
He had his small audience well In
hand by this time and Ormsby's ques
tion was almost mechanical.
. "Who were the four?"
"After , the newspaper rapid fire of
this morning you might guess them all.
They were his Excellency, Grafton
Hendricks, Rumford and Senator Du
vall. They were in the act of closing
the deal as I became an onlooker.
Rumf ord had withdrawn his. applica
tion for a charter and another /straw*
company had been formed with , Du
vall atlits head. ' -: I saw at once what
I fancy Duvall never suspected; that
he was goins to be made the scapegoat
for the ring. They all promised to
stand by him â and you see how that
promise has been kept."
"Good heavens!" ejaculated Lorinjr.
"What a despicable lot of scoundrels!
But the bribe, did you learn anything
about that?" n
\ "I saw it," said Kent impressively
"It was a slip of , paper, passed across
the table by Rumford . to Bucks, face
down. Bucks glanced at it before he
thrust It into his pocket and I had my
glimpse,, too. It was a draft on a Chi
cago bank, hut I could not , read the
figures and I doubt if either of the
other, conspirators knew the amount.
Then the Governor tossed a folded pa
per over. to. the oil man, saying, 'There
i3 ; your .- deed to the choicest piece " of
property in all Gaston, and you've got
it dirt cheap.' I came away at that"
; Elinor's sigh was almost a sob, but
Miss Van Brock's eyes were dancing.
: "Go on. go on," : she exclaimed. "That
Is only the beginning."
â¢ Kent's smile was of reminiscent wear
iness. MjSEsm
"Mercy me! You do need a guardian
angel worse than anyb/dy I know!"
Portia cut in. "Do go on." . *
â¢ "Never mind," laughed Ormsby.
"Miss Portia has a copyright on that.
But before you begin. I'd like to know
if the newspapers have it straight as
far as they have- gone Into it?"
;^."They. have- All but one small detail.
They Tare saying that Senator Duvall
has left the city and the -State.*'
"Hasn't he?" Loring asked.
"He ! hadn't : yesterday."
â¢ â "My-oh!" said Portia. "They will
mob him if he shows himself."
' Kent nodded assent.
"He knows it; he is hiding out. But
I found him."
Â¦ "Where?" from the three women in
chorus. :-''?Â¦â¢
"In his Â¦ own house out in Pentland
place. The family has been away since
April and the place has been shut up.
I took him the first meal he'd had in
thirty-six , hours."
' Portia clapped her hands. The but
ler, came in with the coffee and she
dismissed him and >' bade him shut the
doors.' .
:>'Now ' begin : at the very tip end of
the -beginning," she Â¦ commanded.
\v Kent had ' a sharp >â¢ little :. tussle with
his inborn reticence,^ thrust it to the
wall and told a plain tale.
."It begins in a piece of reckless folly.
? Shortly after I left Mrs. Brentwood's
last Thursday evening I had a curious
experience.;. The shortest way down
town is diagonally through the Capitol
grounds, but some undefinable impulse
led me to" go around ' on the Capitol
avenue side- As I was passing. tha
right wing: of the building I saw lights
i n the Governor's room and in a sud
den fit of desperation , resolved to go
up and have it out ; with Bucks. It
.was abnormally foolish, I'll confess: I
had nothing definite to go on; but I â
well. I was keyed up to just about tÂ»e
right pitch and I thought I might bluff
him." â¢ ' . â¢ ,
Kent looked up rather helplessly.
. "Really," Iâ I'm not sure that I know
anything worth repeating at your din
ner. table.'Nhe protested.
But Miss Van Brock made a mock of
his caution. .
'- "You; needn't be afraid.. I pledged
everybody to secrecy, before you came.
It is understood that' we: are in 'exec
utive session.' And If you don't know
much, you may tell us what you know
now, more than you knew before you
knew., so little as you know now."
: : VHold on," said ; Kent; â¢ "will you
please say that over again- and say It
â¢lowly?" !,'Â¦â¢
"You are not to be allowed to maroon
yourself with Miss Brentwood any
longer," she said dicta tor ially. "You
know more about the unpublished part
of this Belmount conspiracy than any
one else . , excepting - the conspirators
themselves, and you are to tell us all
about it." . : \' .
.'-'You ..are; going to print '. it?" â¢asked
the Building and Loan appraiser.
"I may want to. You may shape it
to that end." '
"I'll stand by my figure's," said Fra
zee. â¢ "It will give me my little chance
to get back at the ; Governor. I had it
assessed as unimproved suburban prop
erty at so much the lot, but he made a
kick to the board of equalization and
got it put in as unimproved farm land
at fifty -dollars ah acre." . Then, look
ing at his watch; "We'd better be get

Accommodation. Won't you stay over
and visit with us?"
; "I v can't, ; this : time, much obliged,"
said Kent; and they drove to the Build
ing; and Loan office, where the Joint let
ter of appraisal was written and signed.
Kent caught his train with something
to^spare, and was back at the capital
in"good time to keep a dinner engage
ment at Miss Van Brock's. He had un
derstood that Ormsby would f be tha
only other guest. But Portia had a lit
tle surprise in store' -for him.,
Loring had dropped . in, unan-'
nounced, from the East; and Por
tia, having first ascertained that Mrs-
Brentwood's asthma was prohibitive of
late dining out. had instructed Orms
by, to bring Elinor and Penelope.
Kent had been saving the results of
his deep sea divings in the oilfield in
vestigations to spread them out. before
Miss Van Brock and Ormsby "in com
mittee," but he put a padlock on his
lips when he saw the others.
Portia gave him Elinor, to- take out,
und he would have, rejoiced brazenly
If the table talk, from the bouillon to
the ices, had not been persistently gen
eral, turning most naturally upon the
Universal Oil Jompany*s successful
coup in the Belmount field: Kent kept
out of It as much as he could, striving
manfully to monopolize Elinor for his
own especial behoof, but finally Portia
laid her commands upon him.

Kent threw off his street coat and
went to eel **** dressing-gown from taÂ«
When he did realize it, he was of
two minds whether to go back or to let
the apology excuse another call the fol
lowing evening. Then the insistent
prompting seized him again; and when
next he came to a competent sense o-f
things present he was standing . oppo
site the capitol building, staring fixedly
up at a pair of lighted windows in the
second story.. - . - Â¦ . '
They were the windows of the Gov
ernor's room, and David Kent's brain
cleared suddenly. In the earliest be
ginnings of the determinate plan to
wrest the Transwestern out of the
grasp of the junta he had known that
it must come finally to some desperate
duel with the master-spirit of the ring
sters. Was Jasper Bucks behind those
lighted windows â alone?
Kent had not meant to make the
open attack until he should have a
weapon in his hands which would arm
him to win. But now as he stood look
ing 1 up at the beckoning windows a
mad desire to have it out once for all
with the robber in chief sent the blood
tingling to his finger tips. True, he
had nothing as yet in the oilfield con
spiracy that the newspapers or the
public would accept aa Â«vldencÂ« at
and the perilous < privacy was at an
end. Nevertheless, he rose and said
gocrd-night, and .was : half-way to the
next corner before he realized how in
excusably abrupt his leave-taking had
been. "
Â¦ They were within two squares of tha
Clarendon, and the cross-street was de
serted save for a drunken cowboy in
chaps and sombrero staggering aimless
ly around the corner.
. "That's â¢ curious," Loring remarked.
VDon't you know, I saw that sama fel
low, or his double, lurching across tha
avenue as we came out of <Alaxned&
square, and I wondered what he was
doing out in that region. 1 * . ?
"It was his double, I guess." said
Kent. "This one is many pegs too
drunk to cover the distance as fast as
we have been walking."
But - drunk or sober, the cowboy
turned s up again ' roost unexpectedly;
this time at the entrance. of the alley
half-way down the block. In passing
he stumbled heavily against Kent:
there was a thick-tongued oath, a'nd
Loring struck out smartly with his
walking-stick. By consequence the
man's pistol. went off harmlessly In the
air. The shot brought Â» policeman lum
bering heavily, from the street beyond,
and the-skirlinff of relief whistles
shrilled on the night. But the man
"That is so." said Ormsby. "And, as
chairman of the executive committee, I
shall have to take steps. We can't
afford to bury you Just yet, Kent."
* "I think you needn't select the pall
bearers yet a while," laughed tha un
daunted one; and then Hiss Van Brock
gave the signal and the "executive,
committee" adjourned to the drawing
room. Here the talk, already so deeply
channeled in the grove political, ran
easily to forecasting^ and predictions
for another electoral year; and when
Penelope began to yawn behind her fan.
Ormsby took pity on her and the party
broke up.
It was at the moment of leave-taking
that Elinor sought and found her
chance to extract a promise from David
Kent.
"I must have a word with you before
you do what you say you axe going to
do, she whispered hurriedly. "Will
â¢you come to see me?"
"Certainly, if you wish It. But yoa
mustn't let Loring's nervousness Infect
you. There is no danger."
"There is a danger," she Insisted, "a
much greater danger than the one Mr.
Loring fears. Come as soon as you
can, won't you?"
It was a new thing for her to plead
with him, and he promised in an access
of tumultuous hope reawakened by her
changed attitude. But afterward, when
he was walking downtown with Lor
ing, the episode troubled him a little;
would have troubled him more if hs
had not been so deeply interested In
Loring*s story of the campaign In tha
East.
Taking It all in all, the ex-manager's
report was encouraging.- The New
Englanders were by no means disposed
to lie down in the harness, and since
the Western Pacific proper was an in
terstate line, the advisory board had
taken its grievance to Washington.
Many of the small stockholders wera
standing firm, though there had been
panicky- defections in spite of all that
could bo : done. - Loring had no direct
evidence to sustain the stock deal the
ory; but it was morally certain that
the Plantagould brokers were picking
up Western Pacific by littles wherever
they could find It.
"I am inclined to believe we haven't
, much time to lose," was : Kent's com
ment. ' "Things will focus , here long
before Washington can get action. Tha
other lines are bringing a tremendous
pressure to bear on Guilford,', whose cut
rates are demoralizing business fright
fully. The fictitious boom in Trans
western traffic is about worked out;
and for political reasons Bucks can't
afford to have the road in the hands of
his henchmen when the collapse comes.
The major is bolstering things from
week . to week Â¦. now until . the Planta
gould people get what they are afterâ a
controlling majority of the stockâ and
then Judge MacFarlane will coma.
back."
"Thus far you have not considered
your personal safety â haven't had to.
perhaps. But you are coming to that
now. You are dealing with a desperate
man, David; ' with a gang of them, la
fact." in VrMf 'nnrtBrMr*fW h M
"Can't I?" said Kent. "Having tha
score written out and safely committed
to memory that will be quite tha
easiest number on the programme, I
assure you."
But Loring had something; to say
about the risk.
"You want to make me say somÂ«
melodramatic thing about having thÂ«
shackles forged and snapping them
upon the Gubernatorial wrists, don't
you? "It will be prosaic enough from
this on.- I fancy we shall have no dif
ficulty now in convincing his Excel
lency of the Justice of our proceedings
to quash* Judge MacFarlano and his re
ceiver."
"But how will you go about It?
Surely you cannot go personally and
threaten the Governor of the- State!"
this from Miss Brentwood.
Kent laughed.
"Alone?" said Elinor, with the cour
age-worshiping light in the blue-gray
eyes.
"Yes; it didn't seem worth while
to double the risk. I did it rather
clumsily, I suppose, and my greeting
was a shot fired at random in the dark
nessâthe Senator mistaking me for
a burglar, as he afterward explained.
There was no harm done, and the pistol
welcome effectually broke the ice in
what might otherwise have been a
rather difficult interview. We had it
out in an upper room, with the gas
turned low and the window curtains
drawn. To cut a long story short, I
finally succeeded in making him un
derstand what he was in for; that
his confederates had used him and
thrown him aside. Then I went and
brought him some supper."
Ormsby smote softly upon the edgÂ«
of the table with an extended fore
fin ser.
"Will he testify?" he asked.
Kent's rejoinder was definitive.
"He has put himself entirely in my
hands. He is a ruined man. politically
and socially, and he is desperate. While
I couldn't make him give me any of
the details in the Tranawestern affair,
he made a clean breatst of the oil-field
deal, and I have his statement locked
up with the other papers in the Secur
ity vaults." x
It was Penelope who gave David
Kent his due meed of praise.
"I am neither a triumphant politician
nor a successful detective, but I recog
nize both when they are pointed out to
me," she said. "Mr. Kent, will you
serve these gentlemen up hot for din
ner, or cold for luncheon?"
"Yes," Portia chimed in. "You havÂ«
outrun your pace-setters, and I'm
proud of you. Tell us what you mean
to do next."
"No; thus far the evidence is all cir
cumstantial. But I picked up the final
link In the chainâ the human linkâyes
terday. One of the detectives had been
dogging Duva.l. Two days ago the
Senator disappeared, unaccountably. I
put two end two together, and latÂ«
last evening .took the liberty of break-
Ing into his house."
Kent shook his head
"It was not so bad," said Kent. "If
it should ever be charged that ha took
money from Rumf ord. here is a plain
business .transaction to account for it.
The deed as recorded has nothing to
say of the enormous price paid. ThÂ«
phrasing is the common form used

establish conclusively wbat the 'other

"It seems to me that these documents

want to do," said Loring, polishing hiÂ»
eye-glasses after his ingrained habit.

if the occult prompting " which had
dragged him out of his chair on the

walked upon the strip of matting in

his approach noiseless. Also, if the

listening- Then he went boldly within, 1

when Kent had passed his cigar , case
and the Attorney General had apolo
g!zed for a weak digestive tract "On
wholly divergent lines and from wholly
different motives we are both working
toward tha same end, I believe, and It
has occurred to me that we might be
of some assistance to each other.'! .-
Kent's rejoinder was \ a mute signal
to the effect that he was attending.
"Some little time ago you came to me

"It Is; a matter of the greatest im

"I am sure you will not regret it If you
will give me a few momenta, Mr.

Kent decided quickly. Being fore
warned, there was nothing . to fear.
"We will go up to my rooms, if you
please," he said, leading the way to
the elevator; and no other word was
apoken until, they were behind closed

"Oh, don't! â you shouldn't say such
things to me," she broke out; and then
he knew he was gaining ground.
"Yes, I must. We have been stum
bling around In the dark all these
months, and I mean to be the lantern
bearer for once in a way. You know,
and I know, and Kent Is coming to
know. That man is going to be a
success, Elinor: he has it In him, and
he sha'n't lack the money-backing he
may need. When he arrives â "
She turned on him quickly, and the
blue-gray eyes were suspiciously
bright
"Please don't bury me alive," she
begged.
He saw what he had done; that the
nicely calculated purpose had carried
straight and true to its mark; and 'for
a moment the mixed motives, which
are at the bottom of most human
sayings and doings, surged in him like
tha sea at the vexed tide-line of an
Iron-bound coast But it was the bet
ter Brookes Ormsby that struggled up
out of the elemental conflict
"Don't mistake me," he said. "I am
neither better nor worse than other
men, I fancy. My motives, such as
they are. would probably turn out to
be purely selfish In the last analysis. I
am proceeding on the theory that con
straint breeds the desire for the thing
It forbids; therefore I remove it Also,
it Is a part of that theory that the
successful David Kent will not appeal
to you as the unspoiled country lawyer
did. No I'm not going to spoil him;
If I were, I shouldn't be telling you
about It But â may I be â¢ brutally
frank?â the David Kent who will
come successfully out. of this political
prize fight will not be the man you
have idealized."
There was a muttering of thunder
In the air, and the cool precursory
breeze of Â«. a shower was sweeping
through the tree tops.
"Shall, we go Into the house?" she
asked; and he took it as his dismissal.
"You may; I have kept you up long
enough." And then, taking her hand:
"Are we safely ashore, on the new
continent, Elinor? May I come and
go as heretofore?"
"You were always welcome, Brookes;
you will be "twice: welcome, now."
General. "And now we are beginning
to see our way a little clearer. It is
not too late for us to move in the quo
warranto proceedings. If you will call
at my office I shall be glad to reopen
the matter with you." ...'..
"And tlfe price?" said Kent, shortly.
"Oh, my dear sir! must. we put It
upon the ground of a quid pro quo ?
Rather let us say that we shall help
each other. You are in a position to
assist me very materially: 'I may be in
a position to; serve your turn. Come
to my office to-morrow morning pre
pared to do your duty aa an honest,
loyal citizen, and you will find mo
quite willing to meet you half-way."
Kent rose and opened his watch.
"Mr. Melgs, I have given . you your
opportunity, and you have seemed to
give me mine," he said coolly. "Will
you pardon me if I say that I can pad
dle my own canoeâ if I ask you to as
sure his Excellency that one more de
vice of his to escape punishment has
been tried and found wanting?"
. For. a flitting moment the castlron
smile faded from the impassive face
of the. Attorney General and an . un
relenting: devil came to peer out of the
colorless eyes. Then Melgs rose cat
like and laid his hand on the door
knob. .
;^"Do I understand that you refuse
to move in a matter, which should
be the first duty of a good citizen, Mr.
Kent?" he asked purrlngly.
:'.-; "I ,' certainly do refuse . to fall Into
such , a* clumsy trap * as you have been
trying to bait for me, Mr. Meigs," said
David Kent, dropping back into his
former curtness. !,,

â "Curious, Isn't It, how sufch thlnjrs

long suits. "How do you suppose they
ftet started?" . \ ,Â« ~ #
"I'm going to see Miss Brentwood to
night," he announced abruptly. "Have
you any objection?"
The millionaire gave him the shrewd
est of overlooks, ending with a deep
rumbling laugh.
"Kent, you are. the queerest lot I
have ever discovered, and that Is say-
Ing a good,; bit- Why, in the name of
all the proprieties, should I object?"
"Your right is unchallenged," Kent
admitted. . . .
"Is it? Better ask Miss Brentwood
about that. She might say It isn't."
"I don't understand," said Kent, dry
tongued.
"Don't you? Perhaps I'd better ex
plain. She might find It a little dif
ficult. You have been laboring under
the impression that we "are engaged,
haven't you?"
"Laboring under " theâ why. good

Ing present to fight for his own nanu,
Kent, as we have seen, had boldly
monopolized ' Miss Brentwood, arid
wouM have committed himself still
more pointedly had the occasion favor
ed, him. None the less, when Elinor
had begged him privately to see her
moving in the attack i on the Junta,* he
had almost resented the implied estab
lishing of confidential relations with
her lover's open rival."
For this cause he had . been post
poning the promised visit; and thereby
postponing the taking of the final' step
in the campaign of intimidation. The
unexplained telephone call decided him,
however. He would go and see Elinor
and have the ordeal over with.
But as a preliminary he dined that
evening with . Ormsby at the Camelot
Club and over the coffee had it out
with him. .
*JI , am glad to know how you feel
about It, Mrs. \ Brentwood ; nevertheless,
I shall ask you to give your consent
some day. God willing."
\He expected an outburst of some sort
and was -. telling ' himself that he had
fairly '. provoked It when she cut the
ground from, beneath his 'feet. '
"Don't you go off with any such fool
ish notion as that, David Kent," she
said, ' not l unsy mpathe tically. "She's* In
love with Brookes Ormsby, and' she
knows It now, if she didn't before."
And it was with this arrow rankling in
him ' that- Kent bowed himself out * and
went, to join the young women on the
porch.
CHAPTER XXH.
: ;'A Borrowed Conscience.
The Â¦ conversation Â¦ on the Brentwood
Kent rose.
"For several reasonsâ one Is that Eli
nor will never marry without my con
sent; another is that she can't afford
to marry a poor man."
"Why?" he asked in his turn.
'.'Because he is giving you another
chance? I don't mind telling you plain
ly . that it won't do : any good, " Mr.
Kent."
She was silent for a time, and when
she spoke again' Kent realized that he
was coming to . know an entirely un
suspected side of Elinor's mother.
"It makes it pretty hard for me,"
she said slowly. "This little drib of
railroad stock Is all that my girls have
left out of what their father willed
them.' I want to save it If I can."
"So do I." said David Kent, frankly;
"and for the eame reason.
Mrs. Brentwood confined herself to
a dry "Why?"
"Because I have loved your elder
daughter well and truly ever since that
summer at the foot of Old Croydon.
Mrs. Brentwood, and her happiness
and well-being concern me very
nearly."
"You are pretty, plain-spoken, Mr.
Kent.- I suppose you know Elinor Is
to be married to Brookes Ormsby?"
Mrs. Brentwood was quite herself
again.
Kent dexterously equivocated.
"I" know they have been engagad
for some time," he said; but the small
quibble availed him nothing.
"Which one of them was it told you
It was broken off?" she .inquired.
He smiled In spite of the Increasing
gravity of the situation. .
"You may be sura It was not Miss
Elinor."
'"Humph!" said Mrs. Brentwood.
"She didn't tell me. either. 'Twaa
Brookes Ormsby, and he said he want
ed to begin all over again, or some
thing of that sort. He is nothing but
a foolish boy, for all his hair is getting
thin."
"He Is a very honorable man," said
Kent.
"I shouldn't put it quite so strongly.
At the same time, I am not the person
to advise you."
The shrewd eyes looked up at him
quickly.
"Would you mind telUng me why,
Mr. Kent?"
"Not in the least. I am an inter
ested party. For weeks Mr. Loring
and I have been striving by all means
to prevent transfers of the stock from
the hands of the original holders. I
don't want to advise you to your hurt;
but to tell you to sell might be to undo
all that has been done."
"Then you are still hoping to get the
railroad out of Major Guilford'a
hands?" I
"Yes." .'
"And in that case the price of the
stock will go up again?"
"That Is Just the difficulty. It may
be a long time, recovering."
"Dctou think the sale of my three
thousand shares would make any dif
ference?" she asked. ,
"There is reason to fear that It
would make all the difference."
"I scarcely feel competent to ad
vise you In a matter which Is personal
rather than legal," he said at length.
"Have you talked it over with Mr.
Ormsby?"
Mrs. Brentwood's reply was openly
contemptuous.
"Br/>okes Orm3by doesn't know any
thing, about dollars. You have to ex
press It in millions before he can grasp
it. He says for me not to sell at .any
price." _â¢) .... ;
' Kent' shook his head. *-"*
Kent took time for reflection before
he answered. It was exceedingly dif
ficult to eliminate the personal factor
In the equation. If all went well, If by
due process of law the Transwestern
should be rescued out vi the hands of
the wreckers, the property would be a
long time recovering from the
wounds inflicted by the cut rates and
the Gullford bad management. In con
sequence, any advance In the market
value of the stock must be slow and
uncertain under the skillfullest hand
ling. But, while it. might be advisable
for Mrs. Brentwood to take what she
could get, the transfer of the three
thousand shares at the critical mo
ment might be the death blow to all
his hopes In the fight for retrieval.
Happily, he' hit upon the expedient
of shifting the responsibility for the
decision to other shoulders.
Mrs. Brentwood confessed that there
had been; that a firm of Boston brok
ers had also written her. Did Mr. Kent
know the meaning of all this anxiety
to buy In Western Pacific when the
stock was going dmvn day by day?
Kent smiled Inwardly at the good
lady's definition of "legal advice," but
he rose promptly to the occasion. If
he were in Mrs. Brentwood's place he
would not write again; nor would he
pay any attention whatever to any
similar proposals from any source. Had
there been any others?
"We were just wondering if you
would imagine the message which Eli
nor was going to send, and didn't, and
come out to see what was wanted,"
she said. "I am in need of a little
legal advice. "Will you give me a few
minutes In the library?"
Kent went with her obediently, but
not without wondering why she had
sent for him, of all the retalnable law
yers in the capital. And the wonder
became amazement when she opened
her confidence. She had received two
letters from a new YorK broker who
offered to buy her railroad stock at a
little more than the market price. To
the second letter she had replied, ask
ing a price ten points higher than the
market. At this" the broker had ap
parently dropped the attempted nego
tiation, since there had been no more
letters- .What- would Mr. Kent advise
her to do â write again?
It was still early in the evening
when Kent mounted the atepa of the
Brentwood apartment-house. Mother
and daughters were all on the porch,
but It was Mrs. Brentwood who wel
comed him.
A Woman Intervenes.

"By Jove!" said Lortng, breathing
hard; "he wasn't as drunk as he
seemed to bel" Â¦ <â¢ '*
Kent drew down his cuffs and shook
himself straight In his coat.
"No, he wasn't drunk at all. I miess
he was the man you saw when we came
out of the square." Then, as a police
man came up puffing, "Let me do the
talking; the whisky theory will be good
enough for the newspapers."
bHAPTER XIX.
Deep Sea Sounding*. .
"Oof! I feel as If I had been dipped
In a warm bath of conspiracy and hung
up to dry In the cold storage of nihil
ism. If you take me to any more meet-
Ings cf your committee of safety I
shall be like the man without music in
his soulâ 'fit for treasons, stratagems
and spoils."
Thus Penelope, after the breaking up
of the Van Brock dinner party. Elinor
had elected to walk the few blocks in
tervening between Alameda square and
Tejon avenue, and Ormsby had dis
missed his chauffeur with the motor
car.
"I told you beforehand it was srolng
to be a political confab." said the club
man in eelf-defense. "And you mustn't
treat it lightly, either. Ten prattling
words of what you have heard to-nleht
6et afloat on the gossip pool of this
town misrht make It pretty difficult for
our David."
"We are net very likely to babble,"
retorted Penelope. "We are not so
rich in intimates In this aboriginal des
ert." But Elinor spoke to the penal
clause la his warning.
"Then Mr. Kent's danger is more real
than he admitted ?" Ehe asked.
"It's real enough, I fancy: more real
for him than it might be for another
man in his place. He is a curious com
bination, is David: keen and sharp
witted and as cold as an icicle in the
planning put, but when It comes to
the infighting he hasn't sense enough
to pound sand, as his New Hampshire
neighbors would Bay."
"I like that side of him best," Penel
ope averred. "Deliver me from a man
of the cold and calculating sort who
Bits on his impulses, sleeps on his in
juries and takes money-revenge for an
insult. Mr. Lorir.g tells a story of a
transplanted Vermonter in South Am
erica. A hot-headed Peruvian called
him a liar and he said: 'Oh, pshaw!
you can't prove it.' " ,
"What a merciless generalizer you
are!" sa5d Ormsby, laughing. "The
man who marries you -ill have his
work cut cut for him If he proposes
to fill the requirements."
"Won't he?" said Penelope. "I can
fancy him sitting up nights to figure
It all out."
They had reached the Tejon avenue
apartmeni-house and to Elinor's
"Won't you come in?" Ormsby said:
"It's pretty late, but I'll smoke a cigar
on the porch if you'll let me."
Penelope took the hammock, but she
kept it only during the first inch c-f
Ormsby's cigar. After her sister had
gone in, Elinor went back to the lapsed
topic.
"I am rather concerned about Mr.
Kent. You described him exactly: and
â well, he is past the planning part and
into the fighting part. Do you think
he will take ordinary precautions?"
"I hope so, I'm sure," rejoined the
amateur chairman. "As his business
manager I am responsible for him,
after a fashion. I was glad to see Lor
ing to-nicht â glad he has come back.
Kent defers to him more than he does
to any one else, and Loring Is a solid,
sober-minded sort."
"Yes," she agreed; "I was glad, too."
After that the talk languished and
the siler.ee was broken only by the dis
tant droning 1 of an electric car, the fizz
and click of the arc light over the
roadway and the occasional dap of one
of the great beetles darting hither and
thither in the glare.
Ormsby was wondering if the lime
was come for the successful exploiting
of an idea which had been growing on
htm steadily for weeks, not to say
months.
It was becoming more and more evi
dent to him that he was not advancing
In the sentimental siege beyond the first
parallel ihrown up so skillfully on the
last night of the westward Journey.
It was not that Elinor was lacking in
loyalty or in acquiescence; she scrupu
lously gave him both as an accepted
suitor. But though he could not put
his finger upon the precise thing saldÂ«
. or done which marked the loosening
of his hold, he knew he was receding
rather than advancing.
Now to a man of expedients the In
terposition of an obstacle suggests only
ways and means fcr overcoming it.
Ormsby had certain clear-cut convic
tions touching the subjugation of
women, and as his stout heart gave
him resolution he lived up to them.
When he spoke again it was of '.he
matter which concerned him most
deeply; and his plea was a gentle rep
etition of many othrrs In the same
strain.
"Elinor. I have waited patiently for a
long time, and I'll go on doing It, if
that is what will come the nearest to
pleasing you. But It would be a pro
digious comfort If I might be counting
the days or the weeks. Are you still
finding it Impossible to set the limit r"
Ehe nedded slowly, and he took the
next step like a man feeling his way
In the dark.
"That Is as large an answer as you
have ever given me, I think. Is there
any Bpeakable reason?"
"You know the reason," she said,
looking away from him.
"I am not sure that I do. Is it be
cause the money-gods have been un
prcpltlous â because these robber bar
ons have looted your railroad?"
"No; that Is only part of Itâ the
smallest part"
"I hoped so: If you have too little. I
have a good bit too much. But that
corners' It In a way to make me sorry.
I am not keeping my promise to win
what you weren't able to give me at
first."
"Please doot put It that way. If
there be any fault It Is mine. You have
left nothing undone."
Tha man of expedients ran over his
cards reflectively and decided that tha
moment for playing his long suit was
fully eezne.
"Tour goodness of heart excuses me
where I am to blame." he Qualified.
"I am coming to believe that I hava
defeated my own cause.*'
"By being too rood to me?" she
suggested.
"No; by running where I should
h*ve been content to walk; by shack
ling you with a promise, and so In a
certain sense becoming your jaUer.
That la putting It rather clumsily, but
Isn't It true?"
"I had never thought of It in thxt
light," she said unresponslvely.
"You wouldn't, naturally. But the
fact remains. It has' wrenched your
point of view hopelessly aside, don't
you think? I have seen it and felt It
all along, but I haven't had the cour
age of my convictions."
"In what way?" she asked.
"In the only way the thing can be
rtood squarely upon Its feet. It's hard,
desperately hard; and hardest of all
for a man of my peculiar build. I am
no longer what you would call a young
man, Elinor, and I have never learned
to turn back and begin all over again
with any show of heartlneas. They
used to ray of me In the Yacht Club
that If I gained a half length in a
xace I'd hold It If It took the sticks out
of my boat."
"I know," she assented absently.
"Well, it'a the same way now. But
for your sakeâ or rather for the sake
of my loveâ I am going to turn back
for once- You are free again, Elinor.
AH I ask Ik that you will let me begin
where I left off somewhere on the road
between her* and Boiton last falL"
of the mid-heart of manliness.
- "I : wish you would tell me one
thing,' Ormsby. Am I responsible for
â for the present Btate of affairs?"
Ormsby stretched the truth a little;
partly for Elinor's sake: more, per
haps, for Kent's.
"You .have done nothing that an
honorable rivalâ and incidentally a
good friend of mine- â might not do.
Therefore you are not responsible."
"That is. putting it very diplomatic
ally," Kent mused. # "I am afraid it
does not exonerate me wholly." %
"Yes, it does. But It doesn't put
me out of the running, you under
stand. I'm forninsf you yet; rather
more stubbornly than before, I fancy."
Kent nodded.
."That, of course; I should think
less of you If you .were not. And you
shall have as fair a show as you are
giving me â which is saying a lot.
Shall we go and smoke?"
He was a small man physically, with
womanish hands and feet and a beard
less face of that prematurely aged cast
which is oftenest seen In dwarfs arid
precocious Infants; and his distinguish
ing characteristic, the one which stuck
longest in the mind of a chance ac
quaintance or a casual observer, was a
for Its fulfillment. On the Friday,-morn
ing there appeared In the Capital Tri
bune, the Midland City Chronicle, the
Range County Maverick and the Agri
cultural Rurallst able editorials exoner
ating the People's party, its policy and
the executive, and heaping mountains
of obloquy on the name of Duvall.
These editorials were bo similar In tone,
tenor and texture as pointedly to sug
gest a common modelâ a coincidence
which was not allowed to pass unre
marked by Hlldreth and other, molders
of public opinion on the opposite aide
of the political fence.
But Hlldreth did not pause at gener
alities. Two days after, the Universal's
triumph in the Belmount field the Ar
gus began to "hit it up" boldly toward
the capitol, and two. things came of It.
The first waaan attempt by some par
ty or parties unknown to buy up a con-,
trolling Interest in the Argus. The sec
ond was the waylaying of David Kent
In the lobby of the Clarendon Hotel by
no less a personage than the Hon. Mel
ton Meigs, Attorney General of the
State.
In his first conversation with Ormsby,
Kent had 'spoken of the three leading
spirits of the Junta as from personal
knowledge, but of , the three Bucks,
Hendrlcks and Meigs, the Attorney
General was the least known 'to him.
Prior to his nomination on the State
ticket Meigs had been best known as
the most astute criminal lawyer in the
State, his astuteness lying not so much
In his ability as a pleader as In a cer
tain oratorical gift by which he was
able to convince not only a Jury, but
the public, of the entire Innocence of
his client. ;- -;:
Kent made fitting answers to all
these queries, hung up the ear-piece
and went away moodily reflective; He
was due at a meeting of the executive
committee of the Civic League, . but
he let the public business wait while
he speculated upon the probable ob
ject of Elinor's telephoning him.
Now there is no field In which the
inconsistency of human nature Is so
persistent as In that which Is bounded
by the sentimentally narrowed horizon
of a man in love. With Ormsby at the
nodus of hi3 point of view, David Kent
made no secret of his open rivalry of
the millionaire, declaring his Intention
boldly and taking no shame therefor.
But when he faced about toward Elinor
he found himself growing hotly jealous
for her good faith; careful. and fearful
lest she should say or do something not
strictly in accordance with the letter
and spirit of her obligations as Orms
by'a fiancee.
For example; at the "conspiracy din
ner." as Loring dubbed it, Ormsby be-
It was In the afternoon of the same
day ; that Kent ; found ; a note - in his
key-box at the Clarendon, asking
him to, call up 124 Tejon avenue by
telephone. He did it at once, and
Penelope answered. The key-box
note had been placed ; at Elinor's re
quest, and she. Miss Penelope, could
not say. what ' was wanted; neither
could she say definitely when her sis
ter would : be in. Elinor had gone
out an hour earlier with Mr. Ormsby
and Miss r Van Brock in Mr. Ormsby's
motor-car. When was he, David
Kent, coming up? Did he know; they
were talking of spending the -re
mainder of the summer at Breezeland
Inn? And where was Mr. Loring all
this time?
"I shall name when the, time comes.
Are you ready to go over to: the Ar
gus office with me? I want to have a
three-cornered talk with HUdreth."
"In a minute. I will "Join you In
the lobby If you don't want to wait."

involves the ; reputation of men high
in authority; but; I shall be strong: to
do my Â¦worn*- duty" Mr. Kent; I; ask
you. to believe; that." " /;â¢;,â¢ ;
Kent nodded and .waved him on.
: "You will readily understand the deli
cacy of the task and how, in the nature
of -things,**'- 1 am handicapped _ and
hedged up on every side. Evidenceâ
of a kind to enable me to assail a popu
lar idolâ la exceedingly difficult to pro
cure."
"It is," said Kent, grimly.
"Exactly. But in revolving the mat
ter In my own mind I thought of you.
You are known at ; the capitol. Mr.
Kent, and I may say .throughout the
State, as Hhe uncompromising antago
nist of the State administration. I have
asked myself this: Is it possible that
Â« cool-headed, resolute attorney like
Mr. David Kent would move bo far and
bo determinedly in this matter of an
tagonism without substantially pavinsr
the ground under his feet with evidence
as he went along?" '..'-.. . â¢ ,
,Kent admitted that It was possible,
but highly improbable.
"So I decided,"; was the smile-tem
pered rejoinder. "In that case It only
remains for me to remind you of your
public duty, Mr. Kent; to ask you in
the name of justice and of the people
o? the State, to place your infornjntion
in the hands of the public prosecutor."
Kent's face betrayed nothing more
than his appreciation of the confidence
reposed in him by the man whose
high sense of official honor was mak
ing Jilm turn traitor to the party/lead
er who had dragged him through a
successful election.
"I have what evidence I need, Mr.
Melgs," he declared. "But if I make
no secret of this, neither do I conceal
the fact that the motive pro bono pub
llco has had little to do with its ac
cumulating. I want Justice first for
â¢what might be called a purely private
end, and I mean to have It."
. "Precisely." . smiled the Attorney
"I believe, as much as I believe any
thing In this world, that you were mis
taken In regard to your feelings for
the other man," he went on calmly.
"But I want to be sure of that for
"I should still insist on doing it. You
gave me what you could, but I want
more, and I am willing to do what is
necessary to win it."
Again she said: "You are too good
to me," and again he contradicted her.
"No, it Is hardly a question of good
ness; Indeed, I am not sure that it
escapes being selfish. But I am very
much In earnest and I am going to
prove It- Three years ago you met a
man whom you thought you could love
' â don't Interrupt me. please. He was
like some other men we know, he didn't
have the courage of his convictions,
lacking the few dollars which might
have made things more nearly equal.
May I go on?"
"I suppose you have earned the right
to say what you please," was the im
passive reply.
It was tlrt old struggle In which
they were so evenly matchedâ of the
woman to preserve her poise; of the
man to break It down. Another lover
might have given up In despair, but
Ormsby's strength lay in holding on in
the face of all discouragements.
"I don't deserve Itâ so much consider
ation I mean," she said; and he made
haste to spare her.
"Yes, you do; you deserve anything
the best man in the world can do for
you, and I'm a good bit short of that."
"But if I don't want you to go back?"
He had gained somethingâ much
more than he knew, and for a tremu
lous instant he was near to losing it
again by a passionate retraction of all
he had been saying. But the cool pur
pose came to his aid In' time.
She sat with clasped hands looking
steadily at the darkened windows of
the opposite house, and he let her take
her own time. When she spoke there
was a thrill In her voice that he had
never heard before.
"Have I dona anything to make yea
think I had thrown common honesty
and self -respect overboard?" he de
manded.
Her answer was another question.
sharp edged and well thrust home.
"Is It any worse to take a bribe thaa
It Is to givo one? You ha-re fust ad
mitted that you are going to buy the
Governor's neutrality, you know."
"I don't see It in that light at aEL"
"The other David Kent would have
seen It. He would have laid: Theaa
men are public criminals. If I can
not bring them to justice I can at least
expose them to the scorn of all rood
men. Therefore I hava no right te
bargain with them."
Kent was silent for a Ions time.
When he spoke It was to Bay:
"Why have you done this. EUnorT*
"Because I had to, David. Could X
do less?"
"I suppose not. It's In tha blood-
In your blood and mine. Other folk
call it the Puritan virus of orer
righteousness and scoff at It I don't
know, sometimes I think they have tha
best of the argument." .
"I can't believe you ara quite sincere
when you say that." she asserted.
"Yes. I am. One cannot compromise
with conscience: that says Itself. But
I have come to believe latterly that
one's conscience may be morbidly
acute, or even diseased. 111 admit I'va
been taking treatment."
"That sounds very dreadful," aha re
joined.
"It does, doesn't it? Yet It had to be
done. As I intimated a few minutes
ago, my life has hitherto been a sort
of unostentatious failure. I used to
think It was because I. was outclassed:
I know nbw It has been because J
wouldn't do as other men do. It has
been a rather heart-breaking process
âto rort out the scruples,' admitting
the Just and overriding the othersâ but
I have been given to see that it is the
price of success." "
"I want you to succeed." she said.
"Pardon me; I don't think you de,

He tried to emulate her coolness
and made a failure of it.
"David Kent, are there any circum

"You mean you are going te take

"That is what I mean."

"But I am not going to faiL"
"You are in duty bound to try tc

"You have had two whole days."
she rejoined. "Haven't you discovered
it?"
"I haven't found anything tÂ» fear
but failure," was his reply.
"I wish I knew how to make you
understand," she returned: anJ then:
"I could have made the other David
Ifent understand."
He smiled rather Joylessly.
"Somebody has said that for every
new point of view gained we have to
sacrifice all the treasures of the old. I
am sorry if I am disappointing you."
"I don't know that you are. And
yet, when you were sitting at Mlsa
Van Brock's table the other evening
telling us about your experlenca with
tha politicians I kept sayln? to my
self that I didn't know you â that I
had never known you."
"I wish I knew Just how to taka

"I am rot r that I like you better
for your having discovered yourself. I
liked the other David Kent."
"I don't know how you measure suc
cess; it Is a word of so many, many
meanings. But I think you are your
own severest critic."
"That may be, but the fact remains.
It Is only within the past few months
that I have begun to get a true ink
ling of things: to Y, â ' for * -ample,
that opportunities ar* - thing* to be
compelled â rot waited for."
She was looking away from him
again.
"Very little, indeed. ; But it ia only
your askings that have been lackingâ
not his good will."
"That was said like the David Kent
I nsed to know. Are you really quits
the same?"
"I hope not," he protested gravely.
"People used to eay of me that I ma
tured late and year by year as I look
back I can see that it was a true Bay
ing. I have done some desperately
boyish things since I was a man
grown; things that make me tingle
whe" I recall them."
"Like wasting a whole summer ex
ploring Mount Croydon with aâ a
somebody who did not mature late?"
"No, I wasn't counting that among
my lapses. An older man than I ever
hope to be might find excuses for the
Croydon summer. I meant In other
ways. For one thing, I have craved
success as I think few men have ever
craved it; and yet my plowlngs In that
field have been ill-timed and boyish to
a. degree."
She shook her head.
Later the ex-manager confessed to a
desire for musicâ Penelope's musicâ
and the twain went into the sitting
room and the piano, leaving Elinor

turned upon him and there were sharp

There was more of a like qualityâ a

.was no rock not to be moved by the

CHAPTER XXIV.
â¢ Into the Primitive.
Tested upon purely diplomatic prin
ciples; Miss Van Brock's temper was
little less than angelic, exhibiting itself
under provocation only in guarded pin
pricks of sarcasm, or in small sharp
clawed kitten-buff etings of. repartee.
But she was at no pains to conceal her
scornful . disappointment when David
Kent made known his doubts concern
in* his moral right to use the weapon
he had so skillfully forged.:
He delayed the Inevitable confession
to Portia until he had told Loring; and
In making it he did not tell Miss Van
Brock to whom he owed the sudden
change in the point of view. But Portia
would have greatly discredited her gift
of insight if she had not instantly re
duced the problem to its lowest terms.
. r "Ypu have been asking Miss Brent
wood to lend â¢ you her conscience, and Â¦
she has . done It,", was the form in
which she - stated the fact. And when
Kent did not >. deny it: "You' lack at
least Tone 'quality of greatness, David;
you sway too easily." /
. "No, I don't!" he protested. "I am as
obstinate as a mule. Ask Orxnsby . or
Loring.- But the logic of ; the thing is
blankly unanswerable. I can either get
down to the , dirty- level of these high
bindersâfight the 'deVil with a brand

"Or what?" 1 she asked. .
"What d ye calc'late the major will
do about It?" said Brodrlck. In the
roundhouse conclave held daily by the
trainmen who were hung up or oft
duty. "Will he listen to reason" and
give us a sure-enough railroad man or
two at the top?"
"Not in eln t'ousand year," quoth
"Dutch" Tiacher, Callahan's alternate
on the fast mall. "Haf you not de
Arkoos been reading? It is bolotics
from der beginning to der ent; mlt der

"Then I am tellln' you-all right now
there's goin' to be a heap o* trouble,"
drawled "Pike County" Grlggs, the
oldest engineer on the line. "The shop

" 'If,' " broke in Callahan, with fine
Â¦corn. ". 'Tls slaplng on yer injuries

"Then that Hetties it," Bald Grlggs,
gloomily. "When does it take hold?"
"The first day a v the month to come.
An' they're telling me it catches every

Grlggs got upon his fwt, yawning

An oil-begrimed

at the dope bucket
and flung his bunch
of waste therein.

First it was Hank Brodrick, who
misread his orders and. piled two
freights In a mountain of wreckage in
the deep cut between Long Pine and
Argenta. Next it was an overworked
night man who lost his head and
cranked a switch over in front of the
west-bound flyer, laying the .1020 on
her side in the ditch, with the postal
and the baggage car neatly telescoped
on top to hold her down.
Two days later it was Patsy Calla
han; and though he escaped with his
life and his Job it was a close call.
He was chasing a time freight with
the fast mail, and the freight was
taking the siding at Delhi to let
him pass. One of the red tail-lights
of the freight had gone out,
and Callahan mistook the other for the
target. lamp of the second switch. He
had time to yell at his fireman, to fling
himself upon the throttle-bar and to
set the airbrake before he began to
turn Irish handsprings down the em
bankment; but the wrecking crew
camped two whole days at Delhi gath
ering up the debris. '
It was well on in the summer, when
the two divisions, east and west, were
strewn with wreckage and the _ pit
tracks In the shops and? shop yard were
filled to overflowing with crippled en
gines, that the insurrectionaries began
to gather in their respective labor
groups to discuss the growing hazards
of railroading ' on the Transwestern.
The outcome was a protest from the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,
addressed to the receiver in the name
of the organization, setting forth in
plain terms the grievance of the
members, and charging it bluntly
to bad management. This was
followed immediately by similar
complaints from the trainmen, the
telegraphers, and the firemen; all
praying for relief from the Incubus
of Incompetent leadership. Not to be
behind these, came the Amalgamated
Machinists, demanding an increase of
pay for night work and overtime; and
last, but not least, an intimation went
forth from the Federative Council of
all these labor unions hinting at possi
ble political consequences and the
alienation of the labor vote If the
abuses were not corrected. â¢' ;-
But later, when the incompetence of
the new officials became the mocking
gibe of service, and the cut-rate
avalanche of traffic had doubled all
men's tasks, the flames arose higher^
and out of the smoke of them loomed
the shape of the dread demon of de
moralization.
The American railroad in its uncon
solidated stage is a modern feudalism.
Its suzerains are the president and
board of directors; its clan chiefs are
the men who have built It and fought
for Its footing in the sharply contested
field of competition. To these leaders
the rank and file is loyal, as loyalty
is accorded to the men who build and
do, rather than to their successors who
inherit and tear down. Add to this
the supplanting of competent executive
officers by a staff of political trencher
men, ignorant alike of the science of
railroading, and the equally important
sub-science of Industrial man-han
dling, and you have the kindling for
the fire of insurrection which had been
slowly; smoldering in the Transwest
ern service since the t3ay when Major
Guilford had Issued his general order
number one.
At first the flre had burned fitfully,
eating its way into the small econo
mies; as when the section hands pelt
stray dogs with new spikes from the
stock keg, and careless freight crews
seed down the right of way with cast
off links and pins; when engineers
pour oil where it should be dropped,
and firemen feed the stack instead of
the steam dome.
When the Receiver Guilfords. great
and small, set their official guillotines
at work lopping on* department heads,
they commonly ignore a consequence
overlooked by many; namely, the pos
sible effect of such wholesale. changes
in leadership upon the rank and file...

right. But I shall have to fight it out

buccaneers will triumph over the

people will suffer loss." Then, seeing
the quick-springing tears in her eyes;
"but you mustn't be sorry for having
done what you had to do; you have
nothing to reproach yourself for."
"Oh, but I have!" she said; and so
they parted.
' ."Come off!" warned M'Tosh; "he'll
hear you\" And ; when Loring came
back with .the cigars there was dry
humor in his eye. r ' â¢ -
"You mustn't let your loyalty to the
old guard get you into trouble with
the receiver," he cautioned; and they
both smiled.; v :; :
"The trouble hasn't waited for our
bringing,", said M'Tosh; "That is why
we are here.;; Durgan hasÂ« soured; on
his job, and I'm more '- than sick of
mine. It's hell, . Mr;-; Loring- I have
been at it twenty years, and I never
saw such crazy railroading in any one
of them."
"Bad management/ you mean?"
"Bad management at the top, and
rotten demoralization at the bottom as
a natural consequence. , We ; can't be
sure of getting a train out of the yards
without accident. Dixon is as careful
a man as ever stepped on an engine,
and he smashed a farmer's .wagon and
killed the farmer ;thi3 morning within
two train-lengths of "the shop junc
tion."
"Drunk?" inquired the ex-manager.
"Never a drop; Dlxon's ' a Prohibi
tionist, dyed in the wool. But just be
fore he took his train, Halkett had him
in the sweat-box, jacking him up for
not making his time. He came . out
red in the face, Jumped on his engine,
and yanked the Flyer down the yards
forty miles an hour.".
VAnd what is your trouble, Durgan?"
asked Loring.
: "Another side of the same thing.. I
wrote Major Guilford yesterday, tell
ing him that six pit gangs, all the
roundhouse 'emergencies' and two out
door repair squads couldn't begin - ; to
keep the cripples moving; and within a
week every one of the labor unions has
kicked through its grievance Â¦ commlt
tÂ§e.\ His reply is an" order announc
ing a blanket cut in wages, to go into
effect the -first of the. month. That
means a strike and a general tie-up."
Loring shook his head regretfully.
"It hurts me," he admitted.- "We had
the best-handled piece ; of railroad In
the West, and I give credit to the men
that did the handling. And, to, have* It
wrecked by a gang of incompetent sal
ary-grabbers â * N '
The two left-overs nodded.
"That's Just it, Mr. Loring," said
M'Tosh. "And we're here to" ask you
if it's worth while . for us to stick to
the wreck any longer. Are you folks
doing anything?"
"We have been trying all legal
means to break the grip of the com
binationâyes." " *Â¦ :
"And what are the prospects?'? It
was the master mechanic ' who wanted

"They are not very bright at pres
ent, I must confess. We have the entire
political, ring ; to fight, and the odds. are
overwhelming:."
"You say you've been trying 'legal
means,' ". M'Tosh put in. "Can't we
down them some other way? /I believe
you could safely count on 'the help of
every, man in the service, barring the
politicals." ;
Loring smiled.
"I don't say we should scruple to
use force if there were any , way to
apply: It. But the .way doesn't offer."
"I didn't know," said the trainmas
ter, rising â¢ to close the interview. "But
if the time ever comes, all you or Mr.
Kent will have - to do will be to pass
the word. Maybe you can think ; of
some way to use the strike. , It hasn't
been declared yet, but you can bet ' on
it to a -'dead moral certainty." V ,
It â¢ was late in the ! afternoon ,. of the
same day . that the Council"
sent;its committee, chairmaned .by. En- '
rgii*eer*ficottr to -Intervie w 1 the t ex- gen-t
erÂ£l,manager at his rooms in the Clar- 1
endon. ' Scott . acted as spokesman,
stating, the case with admirable' brev
ity^ and -conciseness, and asking the
same question, as that propounded by
the trainmaster, to wit: if ..there were
any ? prospect of a return of the . road
to its former management.
Loring .spoke more hopefully, to the
committee than he had to Durgan and
M'Tosh. There had been a little more
time for reflection, and . there* was | the
heartening which comes upon the heels
of unsolicited helptenderings, however
futile. He told the men that the stock
houlders were A moving , heaven and
earth in the 'effort â¢*. to recover their
property; that - until the road should
be actually sold under an order from
the court, there was always room for
hope. The committee might â rest as
sured that no stone would be left un
turned ; also that the good will of the
rank and file would not be forgotten in
the day of restitution, if that day
should ever dawn. > .
When Loring was through, Engineer
Scott did a thing no union man had
ever done before: he asked. an ex-gen
eral manager's advice touching the ad-,
visabllity of a strike.
"I can't say as to that," was the
prompt reply. "You know your own
business best-^what" it will cost, and
what it may accomplish. But I've
been on the other side often enough
to be able to tell you why most strikes
fail, if you care to know."..'
A broad grin ran the gamut of the
committee.
"Tell us what to do and we'll do It,
Mr. Lorinfj," said 'Scott,* brftffly.
"First, then, have a, definite object
and one that will stand the test of
public opinion; in this case we'll say It
is the maintenance of the present wage
scale and the removal of the incompe
tent officers and men. Secondly, make
your protest absolutely unanimous to
a man. Thirdly, don't give the major
time to fortify; " keep ; your; own coun
sels, and don'J send In your -ultimatum
until the finals moment. And, lastly,
shun violence as you would a tempta
tion of the devil."
"Ton's a man," said Angus Duncan,
the member from: the Amalgamated
Machinists, when ; the i committe was
filing out through the hotel corridor.
"Now you're shouting!": said En-
"Surely. My time is not very valua
ble, Just at present Come in, and I'll
see if Mr. Kent has left me any cigars."
"Humph!", said Durgan, when the
ex-manager had gone into Kent's room
to rummage for the. smoke offering.
"And they : give us the major in the
place of such a man as that!" with a
Jerk of his thumb toward the door of
the bedroom.
The wiper was killing time at a win
dow which comanded a view of the
upper yards, with the Union passenger
statioA at the end. of. the three-mile
vista. Being a late corner In the field,
the Transwestern had scanty track
rights in the upper yard; Its local
headquarters were In, the shops sub
urb, where the two' division main lines
proper began and -ended, diverging,
the one to the eastward and the other
to the west.
"Holy smut!"- said the wiper. "See
Dicky Dixon comln' out with the flyer!
How's that for ten miles an hour in
the city limits?" .
I It was a foot note commentary on
the way the service was ; going to
pieces. Halkett, the "political" gen
eral superintendent,- had called Dixon
on the carpet for not making, time with
his train. "If you're afraid to run, say
so, and we'll get a man ; that Isn't,"
Halkett had said; and here was Dixon
coming down a borrowed track in a
busy yard at .the ' speed .which presup-v
poses a ninety-pound rail and nothing
in the way. ., ? ;^

"The dum fool!", said Brodrick. 'Â¦"If
anything gets in front of himâ!,'';
There was" a suburb' street crossing
three hundred yards "town ward* from
the "yard limits" telegraph' office,
which stood in the angle formed j by
the diverging tracks of the two. divi
sions. Beyond the yard the street be
came a country road, well traveled as
the principal southern inlet to the
city. When Dixon was within Â£ two
train lengths of the crossing,' a (arm
v/agon appeared, driven i between the
cut freight trains on the sidings direct
ly in the path of the flyer. The men
at the round-house window heard the
crash of the splintering wagon- above
the roar of the train; and the wiper
on the window seat yelped like a
kicked dog and went sickly green un
der his mask of grime.
"There it is again," said Scott,- when
Dixon had brought his, train to a stand
two hundred yards beyond the "lim
its" office where he should have
stopped for orders. "We're all hoo
dooed, the last one of us. I'll get that
committee together this afternoon and
go and buzz Mr. Loring.":
Â» Now it fell out that these things hap
pened on a day when the tide of re
trieval was at its lowest ebb; the day,
namely, in which Kent had told Loring
that he was undecided as to his moral
right to use the evidence against Bucks
as a lever to pry the Transwestern
out of the grip of the junta. It befell,
also, that it was the day chosen by two
other men, not members of the labor
unions,, in which to call upon the ex
manager; and Loring found M'Tosh,
the trainmaster, and Durgan, the mas
ter mechanic, waiting for him In the
hotel corridor when he came In from
a late luncheon at the Camelot Club.
"Can you give us a few minutes, Mr.
Loring?" asked M'Tosh, when Loring
had shaken hands with them, not as
subordinates. . '.â¢ -.â¢Â¦;! Â¦'Â¦Â¦'*Â¦" .<\ ; -
"There's a notion for you, Scott," said
Broderick. Scott was the presiding of

Grlggs, adding: "I wonder if they

"Has â¢ anybody been to see *Â«n?"
asked Callahan.
Brodrick laughed.
"If you see it in the, papers, it's so,"
he quoted. "What the Argus doesn't

you've got it to do," was the low toned
threat.
"Don't you think It had better be?"
â¢"I had hoped you were in the mar
ket," he demurred. "It would be bet
ter, for all concerned if you had-'some
thing to sell, . with a price attached.
I know what you have been doing and
what you think you have got hold of.
It's a tissue of mistakes and false
hoods and backbiting from beginning

that package of stuff you've got
stowed away in the Security vaults.**
The Governor's chair was on one
side of the writing table and Kent's
was on the other. In plain sight be
tween the two men lay the packet
Bucks was willing to bargain for. It
was Inclosed In a. box envelope, bear-
Ing the imprint of the Security Bank.
Kent was looking steadily away from
the table when he said:
"What If I say it isn't for sale?"
"I told your Attorney General som^
time ago what r wanted and he did
not see fit to grant it." Kent respond
ed. "I,am not sure that I want any
thing nowâ anything you can have to
offer." This was not at all what ho
had intended to say, but the presence
of the adversary was breeding a stub
born antagonism that was more po
tent on the moral side than all the
prickings of conscience.
The yellow-lidded eyes of the Gov
ernor began to close down and the
look came into them which had been
there when he denied a pardon to a
widow pleading for the life of her
convicted son.
"I came up to see what you want â
what you will take to quit," he an
nounced, crossing his legs and lock
ing the huge ham-like hands over his
knee. "That Is putting: it rather ab
ruptly," but business is business, and
we can dispense with the prelimi
naries, I take it."
portions; a large man, a little breathed,
as it seemed, by the swift upward rush
of .the elevator. Kent admitted him
with a nod, and the Governor planted
himself heavily in a chair and begged
a light for his cigar. In the match
passing he gathered his spent breath
arid declared his errand.
"I think we have a little score to set
tle between ua as man to man, Kent,"
he began, when Kent had clipped the
end from his own cigar and lighted it
in stolid silence. â¢
"Possibly; that Is for you to say,"
was the unencouraging reply.
Bucks . rose deliberately, walked to
the bathroom door and looked beyond
it Into the bedroom.
"We are quite alone, if that is what
you want to make sure of." said Kent
in the same indifferent tone, and the
Governor came back and resumed his
chair.
"Xo," he said, shortly; but he Im
mediately cualified the denial. "You

seems very clear to me; but I want
it to seem clear to you. Doesn't your
conscience tell you that you ought
to turn back?" Â¦
'Didn't vou mean to convince me?"
"I don't know; nothing that I had
meant to do. It was a false start and
I am back under the wire again."
"But you must not turn back un
less you are fully convinced of the
wrong of going on ?" she protested.
You have reopened the door to doubt,
and if I admit the doubt A shall fall."
The sonata Penelope was playing
was approaching its finale, and Elinor
was suddenly shaken with a trembling
fit of fear â the fear of consequences
which micht involve this man's entire
future. She knew Kent was leaning
on her, and she saw herself as one who
has ruthlessly thrust an iron bar
amenj the wheels of a delicate me
chanism. Who was she to be his
conscience-keeperâ to stand in the
way and bid him go back? Were
her own motives always so ex
alted? Had she not once deliber
ately debated this same question
of expediency, to the utter abasement
of her own Ideals?
Penelope had left the piano, and Lor
ing was looking at his watch. Kent
saw them throuch the open window
and got upon his feet.
"Grar.tham is saying he had no idea
it was so late," he hazarded. "If I
thank you for what you have said I
am afraid it must be as the patient
thanks the surgeon for the knife
stroke which leaves him a cripple for
life."
It was the one word needed to break
her resolution.
"Oh, forget it; please forget it!" she
paid. "I had no right . . You are
doine a -man's wbrk in the world, and
it must be done In a man's way. If I
cannot help, you must not let me hin
der. If you let anything I have said
discourage you I shall never cease re
gretting it_"
His Emile was a mere indrawing of
the lips. Â«
"Having opened the door, you
would not try to shut it again, would
you? How like a man! But I am
afraid it can't be done. I had been
trying to keep away from that noint

I can't do It now; you have shown
me that I can't."
"But I don't want to be a stum
bling block," she insisted. "Won't you
believe that I wanted to help?"
"I believe that your motive was all
it should be; yes. But the result la
the same."
Loring and Penelope were coming
out. and the end of their privacy was
at hand.
"What will you do?" she asked.

NOTES
On Tilings Bookish
A book which must prove most btlp
ful to mothers and children who find
garden life fascinating Is Louise Klein
Miller's "Children's Gardens." In this
little manual, plentifully illustrated,
the author seeks to point out the best
way for young folks to plant and tend
a garden plat or vegetable . patch by
giving a comprehensive glossary of the
most effective wild and' cultivated
plants and shrubs, advising unon fer
tilizers and cultivation, and citing
cures for the eradication of Insect pests.
Co-operative . gardening as a part of
school work occupies a snare of tha
author's attention.- A simple classifi
cation of trees and flowering plants
makes a valuable Index.

New Books Received
ers have not yet begun to take ac
count of the books they hope to find in
the glorified stocking on that holiday,
the. publishers are beforehand with a
new and tempting list of reading mate
rial for. young minds to feast upon in
delighted anticipation. Already the re
viewer's table is* heaped high With
books of all sorts, that announce their
mission from emblazoned cover, and
highly dramatic Illustration. And to
drop down from the heights of fiction,
history and speculative science to the
flowery plane of children's literature is
for the reader of many books in the na
ture of a pleasing diversion.

the judgment of the little folks them
selves, Is Palmer Cox's new Brownie
book, "The Brownies In. the Philip
pines," which the Century Company
publishes. VOf course, every little tot Is

MISS MIRIAM MICHELSON has
distinctly "arrived," in the: p'iu>
; lance ' of the- book people.- -Of the
very, few new writers of the year whose
work has received the sanction of the
readers and, through that, the publish
ers' favor, this San Francisco woman
is one.. By the daring and the origin
ality "of her first novel, "In, the Bishop's
Carriage," which was published last
March and which commanded instant
success, r Miss Michelson found, herself
suddenly emancipated from the ano
nymity, of Journalism and endowed
with rthie ."distinction that hedges about
the- charmed circle of the writer folk.
Now comes her second book, "The
Madigans," franked with the potent
stamp of The Century Company, and
Miss Mlcheison is securely ensconced
in the writers' temple of fame. All
this within a year.
In her breezy book about the adven
tures of Nance Olden, Miss Michelson
reveals in every chapter the hall mark
of the .. clever Journalist. The news
paper worker's instinct for the salient
points of a "story" is manifested
throughout; the atmosphere of the
world of graft, sensed so intimately by
those whose business makes them. rub
elbows with every type of "les mlser
ables," is reproduced with photographic
clearness; all of the many little Jour
nalistio tricks for the pointing of em
phasis and the sudden rounding of a
climax are employed effectively. In her
first novel Miss : Michelson' is the skill
ful newspaper writer, , little '. else. "The
Madigans" discloses the writer; en
dowed with an appreciation for higher
literary values. Lacking ;riot a whit of
the' r .wif.and sharp observation of the
former, book, this second story, is more
firmly grounded In that which is indic
ative of serious literary workâ a strong
heart interest, the analysis ; of > char
acter and . the significance of some as
pects of life.

sweet little girl of sweet home sur
roundings whose life unfolded day by
day like a flower; she was the little
girl ' of a, modern social perfection or
circumstances if you will. The Madi

"Miriam, or the Sin of David," Is the
correct title of the new play by Mr

runs its course during the English
civil war.
Dr. a. Weir Mitchell has made
in his Look, ""The Youth of Washing-
Ion." Fiction, 1 call il. yet it is not
altogether liction: autobiography â not
that; nor yet is it history. Rather a
dramatization, if the term may be
used, of the boyhood and early youth
of the great commander, cast in the
phraseology of the hero himself.
Drawiug from fact and fancy alike. Dr.
Mitchell has brought to our eyes a liv
liig picture of Washington, made more
realistic by the employment of the per
fconal form in its telling.
Conceiving it to be the desire of the
aged general to set down for his own
edification the events of his early life
which had significant bearing upon the
course of later activities, the author
opens his narrative upon Washington
in the retirement of Mt. Vernon, feel
ing the relief that comes with the sur
cease f roni political vexations and cast
ing back over the record of his young
manhood to draw therefrom pleasant
6lore of reminiscence. "I shall do this
for myself alone," writes the auto
biographer of Dr. Mitchell's conjuring.
**I shall confine my attention to re
calling the events of my youth, and as
1 hate deception even where the imag
ination only is concerned, I shall try,
for my own satisfaction, to deal mere
ly with facts." 8RSS
That Weir Mitchell Is a close and
sympathetic Btudent of the life and
character of the great Virginian is
manifested by the characteristic air of
reserve that he brings to cover all of
the narrative put into the mouth of
that character. All the excessive
modesty and unselfishness of action
that is reflected throughout the pages
of Washington's bona-nde diary and
hi* voluminous correspondence is re
prodnced in this book with a fidelity
which adds to the charm of deception.
Carefully selected phrases, the cer
tainty in every fact's correctness ex
pressed, the restraint exercised in all
Judgments of other men's actions â all
these characteristics of the scrupulous
ly correct and unswervingly just Wash
ington Mitchell has caught and re
flected In this imaginative jmemoir.
The Illusion Is complete.
By the grave communlngs of an old
man with the memories of an honored
lifetime there are brought out delicate
shading* of characters such as cannot
be reproduced In the formal eulogies
â¢f historians. These we feel must be
very close to ; truth, very near ' what
Washington kept locxed up under
guard of his impenetrable reserve. For
example, as to this very character
istic aloofness Itself, Mitchell has his
Washington say:
"It has often happened to me to
learn that I am thought to be a cold
man, but this I believe to be untrue;
for though I am aa concerns social In
tercourse and freedom of speech a man
reserved by nature, I discover in my
â¢elf a treat freedom to express my
self affectionately on paperâ nor do I
conceive that I am unlike others in
feeling the loss of the many friends
â¢whom distance or death have separated
from me."
The real George Washington was
known to be a man possessed, seem
ingly, of but one great fault and that
an occasional ungovernable temper. Of
this the imagined autobiographer
raÂ«V*ff ready * admission:
"Dr. Franklin has wisely said that
no examples are bo useful to a man
as those which his own conduct af
fords and . that be was right in his
opinion I have reason to believe. This
I have observed to be true of anger,
to which I am. or was, subject. I flat
ter myself that I have now learned to
command my temper, although it - Is
â¢till on rare occasions likely to become
mutinous. I do not observe that mere
abuse * troubles me long, but In the
presence of cowardice or ingratitude
I am subject to fits of rage."
Thus are we able to glean from these
reconstructed pages of the life of
Washington Intimate glimpses of - the
treat soul of the man; glimpses which
Ktrike into us more tellingly than the
rounded phrase of a panegyrist or the
Bounding period of a historian. This
clothing of the spirit of Washington
with the tangible form- of his own
thoughts has about it something fas
cinating.
All of the time, too, we are in a puz
xle over the book. What is true? What
is fancy? Letters there are in the text
bearing the names of historical per
sonages and. of seeming verity; but
are they fiction ? Details, likewise, of
the campaign Â¦ at Fort Necessity- or of
the terrible defeat of Braddock, are
here to bring us ' pause; ' what axe their
sources in history or are they sprung
from Mitchell's fine Imagination? Â¦

YOUTH
of Washington
The second story is a plain tale of
e very-day life, written especially for
boys and girls who do not care par
ticularly for stories with a historical
or geographical background. Larry is
a youth who has been knocked around
from pillar to post for a number of
years. He knows nothing about him
self, where he came from, or where he
belongs. He is a bit rough in his ways,
but beneath his rude exterior is a heart
of gold. By the merest accident he
becomes a boatboy, and earns his liv
ing by catching fish. At the lake he
meets people who have â¢ had much to
do with, his past, and have likewise
much to do with his future: and the
unraveling of the curious mystery
which surrounds the lad's identity
makes reading that no young folks will
care to miss. A story of good moral
tone, and quite out of the ordinary. (SI).
Ip. "Stories of Brave Old Times"
Helen M. Cleveland has followed uo
initial successes In The Youth's Com
panion . by a series of tales concerned
with the romance of history in the
days of the American Revolution.
Though this has been done before, few
have brought to a work primarily for
juvenile reading the graphic power of
portrayal that Miss Cleveland exhibits.
Her book is good reading for those not
reckoned as children.
'The Young Vigilantes," by Samuel
Adams Drake, is a book that should
have 'especial appeal to San Francisco
boy. readers, for it narrates some of the
most exciting incidents in the history of
the city and State at large. The story
embraces the old-time voyage across
the isthmus, gold-dlggiEG scenes in
California and incidents in the early
days of our own city. Though not a
paragon of historical exactness. Colonel
Drake's book may be strongly com
mended.
Among Lee & Shepard's Juveniles for
girls particular mention may be made
of four. "The Taming of Betty." by
G. \V. Plcknell, relates the amusin?
incidents surrounding the breaking of
a typical tomboy into a perfect young
lady â very readable even for older Deo
pie. Annie M- Barnes writes "A Lass
of Dorchester," a colonial tale with a
thrilling climax. "An Honor Girl." by
Bertha G. Davidson, is, as tho title In
dicates, a school tale, somewhat out
of-;. the ordinary. "Randy's Good
Times," by Amy Brooks, continues the
fortunes of the heroine in the popular
Juvenile, "Randy's Summer.**
Lee & Shepard of Boston have
brought out a great number of books
which deserve special mention because
of their uniform high grade of excel
lence. Standard fiction for boys and
girls by writers of accented merit are
offered in attractive binding and with
adequate illustrations at the net price
of $1 25â very good bargains for buy
ers of Christmas books.
Edward Stratemeyer, a writer who
has come to take place with Kirk Mun
roe as the author of boys' books, pro
duces two this season: "On the Trail of
Pontiac," and "Larry the "Wanderer."
The first named volume tells of times
in our country immediately after the
war with France . for the possession
of Canada. In those days there was
much unrest and a keen spirit of rival
ry among the French, the English and
the Indians on the frontier.
The plot turns upon the establishing
of a trading post upon the Ohio River,
and many hunting scenes and visits
to Indian villages are depicted. The
historical setting of the tale la based
upon facts, and the Indians are shown
as they actually wereâ neither wholly
good nor wholly bad, and the same
may be said of the hunters, trappers
and traders. A fight with the Indians
and the French In a snowstorm is es
pecially realistic and the entire book
carries with It the atmosphere of colo
nial times.

Frances sang at all; I certainly never suspected" that under her worldly
cynicism dwelt a character which would prompt her to do such work' as
this.
Places were found for us on a platform where the piano stood and a
young lady stepped to the piano. ahead. of Frances 'and struck a few chords
of music, which were -greeted with frantic cheersâ they were the signal
that Frances would sing the song best liked by most of her hearers. I
watched the faces of the people as Frances/sweetly smiling, stepped to the
front of the platform. Pale from, under-nbu'rishment -and bad' air. lined
with early toil, they brightened and were transfigured as'- they eagerly,
breathlessly waited for the sound of her voice. There were women'thcre
of her own age, with faces and features as faultless, possibly, but in whose
eyes; animation had been smothered by hard, dull lives. These, especially,
looked at her with wondering .rapture in their awakened eyes. She 'first
sang a simple folk song of- Italv, and at"the first note the eyes of the elders

were soft and filled with a .great," understanding" pity " which- gave > tier 'an

there arose a general demand for another song~"The;Star^Span^Ied : Ban

:.-,: Uncle Silas,: hurry your trip here. I need your help. I am a fool, cer
tainly, but I do not believe that I am hopelessly one. I think I can be
cured, and I want your help, for I believe that when I am cured I can

"Yes, Uncle Silas, tnere is- a truth of which 1 am proud; I loved her
then, and knew that I loved her for the first time. But, oh; how repulsed I
felt! I, who but an hour before, with cock-sure conceit, had talked of the
absence of spirituality, of sweetness and light, maundering my feeble
words to a woman whose life, secret from her own world, was spiritual;
who was giving sweetness and light from her own rich store into the
starved lives of a people whose existence was unknown to me â to con
ceited me! \ My power of speech left me, and on our way home I did not
speak. Mrs. Lacquerre was silent as I, and I suspect that in spite of her
assumption of martyrdom at this phase of her daughter's life, she is, in
truth, mighty proud of it. â¢
As we reached their home Mrs.' Lacquerre asked me in. saying: "As
we cut short our dinner we must see if we can't find something to eat
here." , ?Â£;%
* As her mother went to' order for us Frances turned to me and said:
"I am only an occasional volunteer in that work. There are men: and
womenâ ladies and gentlemen, if you likeâ who devote their lives to it.
Do you think they find there a man, woman or child who will ever dine
where we dined to-night? Do you think that with, such workers for the
spiritual' uplifting of the poor all is materialism in this city of ours?"
"It is a strange city," I said.' "Life is strange; you are a Â¦ strange
womanâ I 'love you!" . "
When I began the speech I did not intend to finish as I did. nor did
I mean to say what I did that night. It was an impulsive utterance, but hay
ing said it I could not refrain from saying again and again, many times,
"I love you! Will you be my wife?" .
"Certainly not!" she replied, with much conviction. "You have done
nothing." â¢
"Oh!" ; I exclaimed, with sudden light, "is it that you want me to do?"
The world Is too much with us; late and soon.
Getting: and spending:, we lay waste our powers;'**'
Little we see In nature that Is ours.
We have riven our hearts away, a sordid boon! ,
Miss Lacquerre listened ,to me with what seemed impatient indulgence,
and then said: "To generalize from a single instance is said to be a woman's
fault. However, come with mamma and me to-night and see â what, you
will see."
Mrs. Lacquerre regarded her daughter with evidence of mild distress
and asked. "Must we go. dear?"
"I- have promised, mamma." Florence replied. "I do so little for
them it would be indecent to fail after my promise."
"Then we must cut out the ice. coffee, cheese and cognac from this din
ner," Mrs. Lacquerre replied with a sigh. "Come, Reuben; Frances and I
must change our gowns and then you may drive with us and see this aston
ishing gal of mine in a role new to you."
We left the dining-room, with its hundreds of guests bubbling on a
rising tide of conversation, with the animated scene at the height of the
evening's gayety and glamour, and were driven to Mrs. Lacquerre's r I
dence, where the ladies soon changed their dinner toilets into simple
gowns. Then we drove to a part of the city I had not before visited; into
streets densely crowded, yet strangely lacking in animation, as if the multi
tude were listless from fatigue or lack of interest in the further struggle for
life. We were in the section where population is more dense than any
where else on earth â the great tenement district of the very poor.
At a ground floor hall, a large room which might have been made by
throwing two or more stores into one, we stopped, and the carriage door was
instantly surrounded by a pack of faces, children's faces* and presently
there arose a cry, spoken in many strange dialects, "It is Miss Frances!
She is come! She will sing! She will not disappoint!" and, led and fol
lowed by the children, we made our way into the already overcrowded
hall. There we were met by some gentlemen and ladies, who warmly wcj
comed Frances and to whom I was introduced. They were members, of
a tenement mission society, whose work, in part, is to -entertain children
who otherwise would be subjected to the night temptations of the streets.
Not all of the audience were young; there were men and women, some
old, some rough and villainous looking. I must say, but all' equally in

of. real concern as to their comfort, but to the more exclusive, who look
upon that life as they do the theater, as a source of occasional entertain

that we must see the new elephants, and I made plans to do so. I will
not occupy your attention with observations on the contrasting' social at
mospheres we experienced at the two hotelsâ at one, an air almost as if
we were at a private home of pronounced richness and elegance; at the
other as if at some festival of the Tuileries â with no hint of a red-capped
figure to affright. These might be profitable speculations for a brighter
pen than mine, would be worthy a chapter by the philosopher-historian I
long to welcome. But it were futile for me more than thus to indicate
the surging tide of materialistic splendor \^hich has risen over New. York.
Ah, not all New York! That is the point. Another New York does ngt
so much as know of the existence of these palaces whose openings were
the notable events in the programmes of pleasure of those at our elbows
when we dined there! Â¦ " .
Miss Frances Lacquerre brought this to my mind and at the same time
revealed a phase of her life of which until then I- had no intimation.
As we sat at a table illumined with the soft rays of delicately shaded elec
tric lights, silently served with dainty viands* and exquisite wines, in a
hall rich with carvings, with marble and bronze, with satin and silk, listen

faces one looked in vain for trace of worldly care, I said, "The senses

An event of one recent week will give me a theme to illustrate my
meaning. Within that .eck two hotels were opened in this city, either of
which -would have made a nation-wide topic of wondering comment not
many years ago, yet here the event passed with but sonic casual press
notices, as a matter of but slight general interest. In one portion of New
York's manv sided social structure the event was of almost paramount
importance; on the other hand, a vastly greater bulk of the population
did not know that such an event had occurred, and if they had been in
formed would have had but slight, if any, interest in the matter..
One hotel, I am told, stands for the outlay of some eight millions.
It provides patrons with the luxuries the palaces of few princes offer and
which only American. money princes can afford to purchase. There no

is a fairy-like palace of pleasure, whose throngs of patrons would seem
to be creatures of a life aside from this workaday worfd, more like the
radiant presentments of the footlights than the realities of the world of
night and day. Other millionsâ many of them â have been poured into this

. Finally we came down to the beach

launched the boat the rest of us stood
; off - the drink-crazed - Britishers. V They
snarled and howled about us in a semi

Looking a little ahead, one sees hand
some fur collarettes, reaching almost to
the feet, built of ermine and trimmed
with the loveliest black fur flowers cut
bodily out of pieces of black fur. ;
To this list of fashions should surely
be added the newsleeves, which are so
bewildering and bo numerous. ; One of
the latest Is made of: piece lace, fitted
to the arm like the ; bark of the tree.
But'betv-^n the elbow and the shoul
der there are three wide Â¦ lace ruffles
and on each ruffle' there is a little ro
sette of black velveLv;
Around the 'brims of ..'fall he is are
thrown wreaths of autumn leaves.
These are In all the fall i colors, deep
green and deep red and -bronze.^ They
are made into garlands and are caught
at the back. with a great bow of velvet
ribbon with very wide Â¦.'< V ends. The

. One fall hat 2 was deprived of its sum

was- a 4 wreath ; of crimson, roses Bet
around the, crown. A bunch -of the
roses nestled underneath and set off
the hat. A chiffon veil, with a scal
loped border, was draped pretty well
back upon the hat so that the ' ends
trailed at. the back over the hair.
In the world of coming styles one no
tices more than anything else the even
ing gown, which is so charming that
one can see little else. Its colors, its
elaborate allover lace, its lace ruffles
and its great variety of lace trimmings,
these all go to make It so charming.
Some Ideal Gowns for Fall.
. There are gowns that have the lace
chemisette fastened in the back under
, its rosette of , blue tulle, all exquisitely
trimmed with the smallest steel beads.
These jetted or beaded rosettes for the
back of the neck are lovely, but care
must be taken that the beads are not
heavy enough to weigh it down, or the
rosette will sag instead of setting out
smartly. .
Rosettes and balls of chiffon make a
very pretty trimming. In the middle of
each there can be a little ornament or
the rosette can be round and designed
to stand out smartly at the back of the
collar. -These same globes - in smaller ;
size are pretty at one side of the yoke
and ] are frequently seen also In the
front of ; the girdle."
' The"; woman who knows how to pipe
Â¦ should ' use ; her; talent for the finishing
'of, bands of lace. She should run a lit
tle piping along both edges of the lace,
: and Â¦ ehe ' should also ; pips the sleevo
A pretty brown silk dress for early
fall has a deep flounce, upon which are
applied lace roses, cut out and appll
qued to the flounce. Heading this
flounce there Is a band of spangled Jet.
Another gown is built of black cloth
with a deep foot flounce, all laid in
side plaits. The only trimming con
sists of black braid two Inches wide,
put. on in swirls, three rows extending
all the way around the skirt. .
Puffings of silk ara greatly used. Rib
bon two Inches wide is shirred along
each edge and pulled tip to make a
very smart puff. Sometimes the shir
string Is run a quarter of an Inch from
the edge o! the ribbon, so that there Is
a little beading of silk.
â¢ One very smart Parisian gown is
trimmed above the hem with a band
of ribbon eight inches wide. It is
shirred in four places with a shirring
running the entire length. This creates
a 1 series of little silk puffs, which are
very smart Indeed. .
Looking ahead into fall one can fore
cast the styles with some accuracy, ex
cept in the matter of sleeves, and hero
one falls completely, for the new
sleeves are so varied that one can
scarcely predict what Is to come. Dame
Fashion says, "Walt a few day* and I
will show you the prettiest sleeve of
alL"
trimmings, the upper edges of thÂ«
tucks and all other trimmings applied
or Inset. There Is a perfect rare for
pipings and the narrow line of whitÂ© or
blue or black Is a feature of all the new
gowns.
French folds rank first as a trimming
and these folds vary In width from tiny
narrow folds to those that are wlda and
striking. , .
There Is a passion, also, for dangles
of all kinds, and these bans; suspended
from different points In the waist, but
particularly from the girdle, from the
rosettes, from the vests and from the
medallions. You can ret up. a wonder
fully pretty sown by employing these
dangles upon the front.
There is a new note sounded in tnÂ»
waistcoat line. The most brilliant
vests are .being made of flannels or
gorgeous hues. These will be *â¢*â¢l*T
ered and liberally embellished with
braided and cut-out designs. Some
thing really startling is promised m
fall gowns, along vest lines, fcr tne
vests of fall gowns. And she who la
going to build a fall dress should wait
and see what Is to come. Vests of
scarlet are braided in gold and deep
yellow vesta are covered with Jets.
In the trimming line there are
spangled passementeries, which ara
very good. One trimming is built upon
a basis of narrow scalloped lace. The
entire lace is liberally spangled with
jet until it forms almost one solid
trimming. This Is used In rows upon
the skirt.
~ And. speaking of cascades and crin
olines, one comes to the question of
lining the ekirt. Shall it be crinolines
or not ? Several of â¢ the . new skirts
show a very cliff lining, reminding one
suspiciously of the Â¦ crinoline. . Others
are rufflled Inside as well as outside
to make them set out.
But there Is still '.another petticoat
fad . and one that has grown steadily
In favor eince its introduction some
weeks ago. This fad Is for the wired
eklrt. A light wire is run In the hem
Nearly all the skirts are made short
If Intended Â«for street wear, though
here, again, one comes to the dissent
ing vote. There are women who will
not wear the walking skirt, and for
such women there is no skirt except
the one that is of round length sweep-
Ing: the floor in the back and more
than touching In the front. These
skirts , are undeniably elegant. And
as they must be lifted from the ground
there comes the petticoat question
again.
The new petticoats are very bouf
fant to make the skirts set out. In
deed, many of them are so full and
so abundantly ruffled as to look as
though they were crinolined. They
cet out In a veritable cascade of ruf
fles and lace flounces.
Skirts Both Long and Short.
So many gowns are trimmed with
velvet bands headed with a little gold
cording. And each hand Is treated a
little differently from the one above It.
The gold braid is put on straight; or
In swirls, or in scallops, or in a con
ventional Grecian key design. This
gives the gown a very handsome ap
pearance. '
So. if London and Paris are ahead in
some things, it can be truthfully stated
that there are many styles In which
America leads the world.
One of the best of the gowns of the
year is one that was made In a Fifth
avenue establishment for a woman who
goes out a great deal. It is a winter
calling dress, made in a shade of brows
known as walnut brown. The skirt
has a very deep hem and, above the
hem, there are 'four bands of velvet of
different widths. These are sewed *>n
along the upper edge only. The bands
vary from one to four inches. Another
gown had bands sf 1 wider. .The waist
of this gown was a marvelous blous j
falling in a great puff over a wide vel
vet girdle. The front was open to show
a vest all of canary thread lace.
The heavy canvas yoke is quite a
pretty feature of early fall. It is made
of cream colored canvas cut In little
scallops around the edge, for it is 1 an
overhanging yoke finished like a cape
collar. The little ecallups are bound
vith silk,- a::d each is worked with a
little flower. A big scallop of the can
vas htngs over eacjy~shoulde*r like an
epaulette. This style can be recom
mended to any one who is making over
an old dress or planning a new one.
Skirts both for day and for dinner
are trimmed very plainly. It. Is a sea
son of almost deadly simplicity, but
this simplicity costs heavily. It means
that materials must be very handsome,
and that they must be beautifully made
ar.d exquisitely fitted. And. also, that
they must be well carried, as the Eng
lish say. 'â¢>.
And speaking of the English It may
be remarked that Londoners are copy
ing American fashion in dress. There
ere many things that are distinctly
American, and these the Londoners
eagerly grasp. It is to America that
the 'English women go for their shirt
waist fashions, far their sailors and
ready-to-wear hats. And it is to this
country that they come for their neat
shoes, for their bouffant petticoat
styles, and for the very handsome nov
elty goods which the American looms
excel in making.
The Deep Canvas Yokes.
The sleeves, if you will believe it.
were of a different material. They were
made of brown liberty and they con
sisted of lengthwise puffings put to
gether \vii$. white silk cordings. ! It
looks as though the contrasting sleeve
would return.
One dress was in cloth
with tht: -oke laid in alternate shir
rings and bands of lace. .A little dark
brown silk was worked in the yoke in
the shape of pipings and narrow shir-
It is once more the fashionable thing
to stroll in Central Park and very prei
ty afternoon costumes are donned for
this purpose. They are by no means
tailor-made dresses, but smart day
gowns with plenty of lace trimmings,
yet showing signs of fall.
One must b->! distinct ajid individual
in one's fall gown. One cannot be com
monplace, f6r the fashions will not per
mit. Indeed, individuality is the strong
point of the season's dresses. 'Each one
eeens to be very different from the
others.
This serge gown was cunningly braid
ed. It was made in that ubiquitous
style of Eton and skirt with a Bhirt
waist of silk of a different shade and
material. The Eton was short, / box
plaited in the back and rounded in the
front. The sleeves were nothing more
than two big scallops of braided cloth
over silk undersleeves, finished with a
braided turnover cuff of silk at the
wrist.
Yet It was made of serge. Serge, that
old material, that common cloth, has
come In style again, and very nea^and
natty It looks. The finer qualities of
6erge rival much more expensive goods,
while the heavy, coarse qualities look
not unlike the imported winter cloths
that are so fabulously dear.

to his present sickness he forgot to

Of course there are other more bru
tal ways of scooping up matrimonial
misery, hut we coukl not indorse them.
A drunken man is too horrible, but the
husband who artistically festoons him
self with a low-cut-decollete-swallow
tailed-dress-sult-club-house jag can
make things equally lively 'and divert
ing, and can generate a tankful of mis
ery on surprisingly short order.
If the foregolnc recipes do not dish
up a copious, highly spiced Hung'ry
goulash cf misery, then some people
will' have to make the best of existing
conditions and try to reconcile them
selves to the old-fashioned matrimonial
state of things, and be happy though
married.
Another misery whooper-In is the
question of finances. A stingy man is
a perennial mlserv bloom. Tell a wife
that she would ruin a Carnegie, and
poke your nose into every detail of
housekeeping. It will prove an unfail
ing misery-breeder.
Criticize each other in the most vi
cious manner. A husband should
nsver fall to tell his wife that no mut
ter what* she puts on she'd Â¦ still look
like a fishwife on Saturday market
night, and praise in the most unstinted
terms everv other woman he knows,
adding that he wonders whv he did not
marry so and so. instead of tying him
self to a dilapidated-looking frump.
Snarl and sneer at each other like two
half-sick. Ill-natured terriers, and It
will surely send the misery up Hka
mercury in the S0'3.
If the husband does not or will not
work, he should hang around the house
.all day, finding fault with everything
and everybody. Incidentally cuffing the
kids. This is one of the prettiest mis
ery-etchings knownâ a real work of
art.
. If a wife has a past regardlnr which
she is particularly sensitive, the hus
band should never forget It himself,
nor allow her to do so.
Every time a . husband wants to go

When she had started out an hour

along the crisp, shelving sands, she
had been one of the most indifferent,
light-hearted of girls. She was dona

And in her heart she knew that she
must have been beginning to think too
much of the man whose attentions to
her had been so marked, or else this
discovery would not so affect her.
Sitting to rest and watch the white
crested waves ' come curling up to
break on the border of the lake like
threads of rarest lace, her attention
had been caught by a small, white,
whirling object that at first sight she
had taken for a bird. -It had whisked
lower and nearer. Then it floated so
close she could put out her hand and
grasp it, and she found It was a sheet
of note paper covered with . diminutive
chirography. It was written on the
stationery of the fashionable hotel
looming up on the dunes behind her.
At first she had been about to crumple
It up and cast it aside. But in the very,
act of doing so a name â her own name
â met her eye.

quite up to her white standard. Â¦â¢, But
she's not really In the social swim.
She's a native I take it. It's been hard
to pin her down ,to any confidence
about herself. She lives with a very
dragon of an aunt at a farmhouse on
the edge qf town. She wears her cot
ton dresses and shade hats in a way
that takes the shine out of the women
up at the hotel, but I've never seen her
sport any of the swell clothes they
wear to the hops here. Oh, confound
itl What's the use of my mooning
away to you at this rate? I've got to
go away and try to forget her before

Densmore caught her hand in his.

when it broke down on me this after
noon, but I'll take them all back," ha
said.-|S9BBnpHHMmnBHBa|

Â¦ "Peggy may be forgiven If she dreamed
of raanv things after. thatâ of an old
gray castle in the hills of Coburg: of
three letters and a royal title preceding
her own name; stationery bearing the
crest of ' the '". triple-headed eagle. In
fact, she did dream much of these ad
vantages at first, and ' the Interesting
German , of } that first Wednesday night
hop was suddenly vested, in her ; mind,
with much romance and much ellgibil-
Thenâ oh, heart of woman! â after the
first romance of the thing had, worn off,
and his Royal; Highness had begun to
repeat , his rather slender ' i store ', of
bright : remarks. . she .found herself
dreaming of Donald .Macomber, and
wondering .why he ' had not come back
to her as 'all '<Â¦ the others had. She re
membered that 'Macomber had always
been masterful ; and ' high-handed, even
as a sui tor, and that - it was because he
had been unwilling to.yield some trivial
point- that she - had I broken with ! him.
Peggy, ostensibly to relieve the va
cant feeling in her heart, began a
desperate flirtation. In" a week's time
Munsterberg was her slave. Where
Peggy went there; went he. He drove
w5th her; he sailed. with her on the
lake; he climbed:" the mountain with
her. As Peggy's satellite he seemed to
have found his > true vocation.
It is doubtful if Peggy entertained
a really serious thought of the Ger
man .until the day Jack Motley dis
coveredâby means of a crest on a
silver* brandy flaskâ that worthy's true
identity.
â¢"TNEGGY met him first at one of
%hj the . Wednesday night hops at
|^ the Waconessett inn. He was
X somewhat more than passably
good looking, fair haired, of a mili
tary build, and German. His name
was understood to be Munsterberg. He
danced a number of times with Peggy
and finally they began . to sit out
dances in a quiet corner of the veran
da, where, with their chairs close to
gether, he talked to her in English
with. the faintest of German accents,
and * she replied in American-made
German that set them both laugh
ing. â¢
The advent of the German was
timely for Peggy. She had Just fallen
out 'with Donald Macomber, had sent
him back the ring, and being in the
after-throes of a broken engagement,
the was sadly .in need of diversion.
The German seemed to give good
promise of this. He was well bred,
possessed of that urbane, finish that
much travel alone can give and, more
over, after that first dance with Peg
gy it was plain to be seen he was very
much] In love with her. '.'
The rescuers fished them outâ Prince
Ludwig Wilhelm of Coburg-Gotha first,,
for he was far spent. And while at
the inn they were rolling him : in hot
blankets and pouring brandy down his
throat, Peggy was laughing and cry
ing hysterically on the shoulder of
the other Princeâ although he was not
known to the world at large by Â¦ his
title. It 'is trueâ and making a _ most
absurd confession. When she had fin
ished. Donald's face was very grave.
"But If he had drowned, what then,
Peggy?" he quest^ned.
â¢'Coburg-Gotha could have got along
without a Prince better than I could
without you,"- she said.
Peggy deliberately put one little foot
on the spreader, and In a moment they
were in the water.
When she came to the surface shÂ«
was seized by a strong arm, and a big,
tender voice said evenly:
"Don't struggle, dearest; yon are safe
with me."
And Peggy closed her eyes and was
very happy.
Not so his Roval Highness of Co
burg-Gotha. He was floundering about
miserably, and shouting spasmodically
between. choking gurgles:
"Helpâ in God's^name, help! I do not
swim!"
She began to think seriously and to
compare his Royal Highness with Don
"ald. And when the comparison, point
by point, was ended, Peggy was a very
unhappy girl, to whom the castle la
Coburg was a nightmare.
And because of all these thins* thÂ»
throne of Coburg-Gotha barely escaped
losing its heir.
It happened one August evening. His
Royal Highness was paddling Peggy
slowly about the lake, singing, as hÂ«
paddled, little sentimental German
songs, and looking very contented.
Peggy gave the song no heed. She
was watching a solitary figure In an
approaching canoe. The figure bent ta
the paddle in an easy, familiar manner.
There could be no mistaking those
broad shoulders and that curly brown
hair. The two canoes drew nearer.
The man In the other canoe looked up.
Peggy 'smiled and bowed; Tha man
nodded coldly and began to paddle
faster.
Something seemed to dutch * her
throat. The Prince was Quits forgot
ten. She realized only that Donald
Macomber was paddling out of fiÂ«r
sight and out of her Ufa.
â¢'Donald!" she cried.
He paddled on with never a glanca la
her direction.
. "Donald!" she cried again, as ha still
gave no heed, she tremblingly stood up.
His Royal Highness gasped.
"Sit downâ sit down!" he urgsd.

1812, the Emperor arrived at the Nle
men, the "extreme frontier between
Russia and Prussia.' As he appeared
on the banks of the river at 2 o'clock In
the morning his horse suddenly stum
bled and threw him. .A voice crled>out:
"This is a bad augury. If this occurred
to a Roman general he would turn
back." It is not known whether It was
the Emperor himself or one of his suite
who Bpoke the words. "The next day,"
says an eyewitness, "scarcely had the
Emperor, crossed the river than a dull
noise agitated the air. The light after
ward became obscured, the wind rose
and the sinister rolling of thunder was
heard. The heavens , had a menacing
aspect, and the bare, shelterless . earth
presented an appearance that filled up
with sadness. Some of those who but a
short time before were inspired with
enthusiasm were now shaken with fear,
as if they regarded these circumstances
as of evil omen. They believed that
these fiery clouds which were gather-
Ing, over our heads were forbidding our
entrance Into Russia.". At. any rate,
those wise after the event declared that
they had portended -the burning of
Moscow, with its appalling ' conse
quences to the grand army. , Then, on
the morn of Waterloo, the : Emperor:
met with yet another ominous mishap.

thinks that it is probably an adapta

Africa, when, having stumbled, he,
with admirable presence of mind, ex
claimed. "Thus I take possession of
thee, O Africa." When William was
arming for the battle of Hastings his
squire, by accident, handed him the
back piece before the breast plate, an
evil omeji signifying flight; but the
Duke again turned the mishap to cheer
ful account. "Yes, the last shall be
first," he said; that is, the Duke shall
be King. .
Others, however, there have been
who have met the evil omen half way,
so to speak, by throwing up the
sponge as soon as it occurred. On the
morn of the sanguinary battle of
Shrewsbury, Hotspur called for his
favorite sword, arid on being told that
it had been left behind at the village
where he had spent, the previous
night, he turned pale and said: "Then
has my plow reached its last furrow."

should be regarded as a manifestation
of divine displeasure, and as such an
evil omen In regaftl to the fate of the
Russian arms in the Far East. In the
uncertain volcanic atmosphere which
envelops nations engaged in war, every
throb of the political ground is acutely
felt, every tremor in the air Is caught

MEDIUMS TO ORDER
tnem, and will at tne same time allow
the most beautiful thing she possesses
â h*r~ delicate hairâ to lie . uncovered
to catch every stray particle that may
choose to fall upon It, thereby clogging
its roots, filling Its pores and dulling
its color. Protect your hair well on all
occasions of this, kind and you will
not- need^so often to wash It;, for too
much washing, aa you know, ruins the
most beautiful things.
When you have finished the house
work and are ready to sit down at
your sewing or darning, or perhaps to
scan the magazine, you very naturally
do not want to waste the precious and
pleasant moments of the day strug-
the hair and note Its added pliancy
and grace.
After breakfast you will no doubt be
ready to dust or sweep or clean clos
ets or beat rugs or to do some of the
innumerable things about the house
which set the dirt a-flying. . Before you
begin this stop an Instant and care
fully pin a cap or even a plain hand
towel about your hair, covering it
thoroughly, bo that not a particle of
dust can settle on its coils. It is strange
how a woman will --palnf uly stretch a
sheet across her dressing table, . pin
covers about her pictures and throw
dust clothes over her bed "before be
ginning to sweep, in order ' to protect
ends that fly in stray wisps about
the cheek and throat. A wo
man's hair is like a plant's blos
som; without it she is gauntly unat
tractive. The moment a little bride
forgets to curl her hair and is satisfied
to twist it up in a hard knot at the
back or to wear it straggling . in her
eyes while she goes about getting the
breakfast she is teaching her husband
to forget to caress her and to be sat
isfied without kissing _ her good-by
when he starts out to business. It
takes just ten minutes longer to make
oneself pretty for breakfast, to fasten
a belt about one's waist, to pin the
shirt waist down snugly, to. put on a
fresh color and to arrange one's hair
as gracefully as one would for com
pany. Isn't it worth while to set the
alarm clock ten minutes earlier mere
ly for the self-confidence and pleasure
this gives if for nothing more? Then,
too, the hair may be cared for, just
like a growing- flower, all. day long,
without once stopping the housework.
The hair is just like a flower. It
should be given sun and air and water
like a plant or it will cease growing
as a plant does. It should be tended
about the roots, cared for and pruned
and watched like the most delicate
rose that ever bloomed. And like the
rose, the more care and attention it
receives the longer will It retain its
contour, color and luxuriance.
If the little housekeeper will rise Just
ten minutes earlier each morning and
fchake her tresses out to the winds,
she will feel the cool morning air on
her scalp like a refreshing draught of
water. Put your head out of the win
dow, if you can, and with the fingers
grcr.tly massage the scalp, beginning
at the forehead and working back
ward to the nape of the neck. This
will stimulate the blood through the
scalp, will stir up the dead cuticle and
will invigorate each hair with new life.
A very, very few minutes spent In this
way each morning will give to your
hair many more years of beauty and
color. When you have finished divide
the hair evenly with the comb into
four or five portions, and with a stiff
brush give each portion twenty or thir
ty good hard strokes. Then arrange
housekeeper. Somehow after her
wedding day, the girl who has elected
to bury herself in pots and kettles and
pans for the Eake of a poor young man
loses all identity with the dainty,
charming little creature who first
caught the eye and heart of that
young man. Actresses, in spite of
late hours, hard work, travel and
cosmetics, retain their bright eyes,
beautiful hair and good complex
ions often, until they are too old
to see to read their lines. Busi
ness women keep their trim figures
and healthy color through tedious days
of nerve racking responsibility. But
the woman who does her own house
work often loses her freshness in the
first year or two after her honeymoon.
Somehow she forgets* to curl her hair,
after she has washed and dressed the
baby. She has no time to make pret
ty frocks when she must make so many
beds, and pies and biscuits. Worst of
all, in her effort to keep the domestic
regime emooth, she lets her little fore
head become wrinkled and furrowed
in her anxiety to keep her husband's
pocketbook fat, she lets her hair get
thin, and In her desire to ksep the par
lor straight, she allows her lithe, young
flgnre to become crooked and slouchy.
Running a bouse and making a home
is woman's most difficult and most
beautiful work; but there is no excuse
for any woman to remember everybody
and everything else in the struggle
and to forget her own se!f. No man
will thank you for serving him a sweet
pudding with a bout face, for launder
ing him clean shirts ana socks and
Igolng about with a dirty smudge on
your nose, or for keeping a bright fire
on his hearth and a melancholy look
upon your face. He would be much
more grateful if things were the other
way about. Men talk a great deal
about the woman who is useful and
who loves them, but they, nine time3
out of ten, fall in love with and stay
In love with the woman who is beau
tiful and loves herself.
Among all the disfigurements which
a long apprenticeship at housework
Â¦eems to bring:, nothing is worse than
the gradual thinning of the hair abouf
the temples, the slow appearance of
gray at the edges of the once beautiful
brown locks, the acquisition of stringy
THERE Is no woman upon wnom
Time so delights to take his re
venge as he does upon the unof
fending and unsuspecting little
poo a gooa tax soap or a plain castlle
Boap â nothing else except warm water.
Do not make the bath too hot and do
not put ammonia In it. To attempt
to burn your hair out In this way Is a
fatal mlstaJr.o. Scrub thoroughly, rub
bing the scalp well and washing the
hair as you would a piece of cloth.
Above all, rinse the hair thoroughly in
warm water and be sure that every
particle of the soap 13 removed, so that
the pores are free to breathe. Dry
the hair in the air and the sun. Fan
it, if you like, and nib it with the
towel, but avoid the life-killing, hot air
from the radiator or the gas stove, ir
you do not want to rot and ruin the
best part of your locks.
Nearly half of your life is spent In
bed and thus nearly half of your life
your hair is in tight pig-tails and curl
papers. This la unfortunate for many
reasons. First of all. it keeps the
scalp from the air and Is not good for
the roots of the hair. Secondly, it
would drive the most devoted man to
the other woman or the uttermost
parts of the earth. Take quite as much
pains Jn arranging your hair for the
night as you would for a party. Do
not attempt. to- put 'it up-convention
ally, but dress It ' picturesquely. One
of the prettiest night arrangements Is
the Marguerite fashion of two plaits
down the back, loosely woven and
gracef uly â¢ parted. " ;
Above all, little Â¦ housekeeper, keep
up with the fashions. Do not sit at
home until you have forgotten what
"style* Is, except through what you sea
in the fashion magazines. Remember
that all day, on his way to business,
at lunch and even among the stenog
raphers In his office, your husband sees
women with fashionably arranged hair
and he is unconsciously comparing you
with them. It Is all very well to talk
of beauty, regardless of style, but
beauty Is never Independent of style.
Things are beautiful only because they
are considered so. It Is not necessary
for you to be outre and extreme la
dressing your hair, but to look young,
you must at least afpproximata
the latest style of hair dressing; to
wear pompadours when they ara fash
ionable, a part when It is In vogue, or
a bang when other women art wear
ing them. You can, however, always
modify the style to suit your own facÂ«
and If possible always pick out tho
most picturesque fashion. At present,
nearly every girl Is a picture, becaus*
the beautiful Madonna fashion of wav
ing the hair, parting it In ths mlddl*
and knotting it gracefully low at tho
back of the neck Is tha most pio
turesque style possible. It aaams to
accord with Gainsborough and shep
herdess hats, with roses tuckad In tao
curls, with quaint whits muslin
dresses, and with every other t&forlto
of the artists and the stage.
Usually the little housekeper Is too
poor or too frugal to patronize the
hairdresser, or to Indulge in a sham
poo at a dollar or half a dollar at one
of the big hairdressing establishments
in the department stores. And so. In
an In Irregular, off-hand sort of way
she "washes" her hair â¢ when it is
"dirty" or "sticky." For this "wash"
she uses any soap that may happen to
be about the house, rinses quickly and
dries her hair over the radiator. Such
treatment will kill the finest hair In a
few years. You should decide upon
a regular Interval for shampooing your
hair, and you should "shampoo" it. If
you have very dry hair, do not wash
it oftener than every three weeks, and
you might let it go for four weeks with
prudence. If your hair is oily you may
indulge in a shampoo every two weeks,
but not oftener. Some girls, during
the rage for fluffy hair, were In the
habit of washing their hair once a
week or oftener, a process which took
all the natural life and oil out of the
finest locks and left them dry, hard,
dead and ready to fall out at the first
sign of Ill-health. Use for your sham-
Cling: over your appearance. You
haven't time for everything, you argue,
and you must get the mending done or
you must read and improve your mind
a little, or you must nnlsh a niece of
fancy work. Well, do it; do any or all
of the things you want to do or ought
to do, but first choose a sunny corner,
by an open window, and, sitting there
with the sunlight filtering In on your
back, let down your locks to the winds.
Let them blow and play about your
shoulders. Give them chance at the
air and sunlight, just as you would
give your flowers â¢ that, chance to
breathe and to draw in life. The divine
Sarah, Bernhardt never confines her
locks when she is in private. All day
long when she Is at home they fly to
the sun and winds and are untouched
by a hairpin or ribbon. That is why,
even as a grandmother, she still has
golden tresses instead of iron gray
wisps of hair.
Nothing is so good for the scalp) and
the hair Itself as a daily sun and air
bath and nothing is so comforting or
less trouble.

TO DARKEN BLONDE EYE
BROWS (Helen).â Your eyebrows can
be greatly improved in a few months
by careful training. Daily brushing
from the inner corner toward the tem
ple will excite the hair follicles to more
healthy action and cause the growth to
assume a pretty curve. An application
of plain yellow vaseline will stimulate
the growth and darken the shade of
the hair In a few weeks. As a matter
of convenience two small brushes
should be used and kept expressly for
this purpose. ' One brush, should be
kept perfectly dry to complete the day
toilet and the other used for applying
the oil. Either the very small nail
brushes or small, tooth brushes, such
as are sold for the use of children, will
answer the purpose nicely. After the
nightly face bath dip a brush in vase
line and gently stroke the .eyebrows,
always outward, following their natu
ral outline. Careless use of. the brush
or the finger tips will dislodge many
hairs .which, might otherwise be pre
served;. Repeat; the application until
the skin will: absorb < no more.; occupy
ing ten o~r, fifteen minutes In the work.
With a soft cloth wipe away, any sur
plus'oV either side of the- brows. I
suggest this as a matter of neatness
as; well as^ to prevent an Irregular or
superfluous^ growth of hair on the face.
Be. sure, however, you leave the hair
of the: eyebrows quite oily. Once or
twice during the day you may also
apply a very, little vaseline to the
brows: ; If carefully done It "will not
give the . skin a gr'e.asy appearance and
will - materially hasten" the darkening
process.
ERUPTIONS OF THE SKIN (Mary).
When the skin is^ very oily and al
ways more or less disfigured by black
heads and pimples, it clearly indicates
an over-secretion of the sebaceous
glands and impaired circulation, which
must be relieved before a better condi
tion will prevail. Skin foods, under
these circumstr.-res, should be strictly
tabooed, except in a very small quan
tity and when absolutely necessary to
prevent the skin from actually becom
ing rough from exposure to the wind.
Additional oil for the skin is absolutely
useless, for it aggravates the condition
and thus creates more eruptions. ( Fre
quent bathing, to cleanse the congested
pores, Is of paramount importance and
when followed by massage to encour
age more perfect circulation a cure can
be begun speedily. Turkish wash cloths
and towels are too harsh to use when
the skin la sensitive from eruptions;
use Instead soft towels and cloths ot
damask. A bland pure soap, such as
castile. is most refreshing; a mild
astringent heating lotion and some re
fined toilet borax will also be required.
Before retiring make a lather of hot
water and soap and rub over the face
several times with the finger tips doing
the wc/rk thoroughly; this will assist In
setting the cfogged pores in action. To
a basin of hot water add a liberal pinch
of borax and wash the face to remove
the soap, rinse with clean warm water
and again In cold water fo close the
pores, dabbing the water on with a
clean soft cloth. To the cold water
used should be added ten drops of sim
ple tincture of benzoin. With thumb
and finger press out the worst black
heads and pustulated pimples, dab with
warm water, dry and baths the. spots
every night with the following healing
lotion: Take one dram of gum cam
phor, two ounces each c-f water and
best alcohol and two drama of milk of
sulphur: dissolve the gum camphor \\n
the alcohol, then add the other.Ingre
dients and shake well each time before
using. The materials â¢ for.'; this , lotion
may be obtained f run any . high-class
drug store.
TO BLEACH THE SKIN*(E. E. ,B.).
As the sensitive qualities of the skin
differ with each Individual, I cannot
state positively Just what degree of
strength of peroxide of hydrogen you
can safely use to bleach the skin of
your- face without injury. It is rather
risky at best, but if you insist on mak
ing a trial here is a safe method. Get
a pint of peroxide of hydrogen and
have a perfectly clean quart bottle In
readiness. Put one pint of clear cold
water In the bottle and one-fourth pint
c-f the hydrogen, shake and then bathe
the face with the solution twice each
day. Always be particular to precede
the application with a thorough face
bath, drying the face on a soft towel.
If no irritating effects are felt afi;er. a
week's use, gradually increase tha
strength of the solution until it is equal
parts of hydrogen and water. Continue
the treatment for a month and then
discontinue for the same period and re
peat If necessary. Always keep the so
lution In a cool da'rk closet, as it spoils
quickly if exposed to strong light. Be
very particular to keep the solution
away from the edge of the tyalr, eye
brqws and lashes, for It will bleach the
hair.

muddy, the clear shade of natural
pongee. Iron the silk while still damp,
but not wet, using as cool an iron as
will remove the wrinkles. Press on
the wring side and be sure to have the
ironing board heavily padded, as hard
wrinkles In the pad will cause ugly
shiny streaks on the goods. If such
streaks should appear by accident
sponge and reiron the spot.
enervating ana also apt to still fur
ther decrease her weight. The girl of
16 vear3 should not use a face cream,
only occasionally, unless the skin
seems very dry, and this la rarely tha
case unless an , anaemic condition
prevails. When the face or lips chap,
then, of course, one or two applica
tions of a slightly oily cream Is essen
tial to restore the natural softness of
the skin. A very little purs talcum
powder on the face after the bath is
not harmful, but it should never bÂ«
used unless the skin is perfectly clean
and should be washed off thoroughly
before retiring to prevent clogging tha
pores, which would result in pimples.
An excellent cream to soften and
whiten the skin is made thus: Take
three ounces of oil of sweet almonds,
one-half ounce each of white wax and
spermaceti and two ounces of rose
water. Cut the wax and spermaceti
in small pieces, put in an enameled
pan, set in a pan of hot water, and
when the Ingredients are melted beat
in the almond oil and lastly the rose
water. Beat continuously until tha
mass forms a smooth white cream.
As you hair is abundant and curly you
should have no difficulty, after a little
practice, in arranging it In a becom
ing manner, puffing it out about the
face without the aid of snarling or a
"rat," neither of which I can recom
mend- Snarling the hair Is very
harmful to its growth and condition;
the vigorous brushing and combing
incident to freeing it from the mass
of knots when dressing it breaks and
wears it off rapidly.

well and'good to give*. advice' as. to this,
that' a!M the other thing, but it is
frequently the part o,f. wisdom not to
accept this selfsame advice. No one
should help shape the destiny of others
âthough, there, are scores of people
who fairly revel when poking their
fingers into matrimonial pies.
Perhaps, after all. as there Is no
time set for the coming of this love,
which is supposed to be. the basis of
happiness and contentment, the time
to'marry'ls ."when a woman, young or
eld. meets the man she loves."
. And when one stops to , think of it,
that sounds â¢ surprisingly like an old
fashioned love match. Does It. not?
nles,, marriRge. Is somewhat of a re
sponsibility, that Is quite as well post
poned Just another, year arid then
another. Splnsterhood loses many, In
fact, all. of Its terrors, and after a girl
has reached the age of thirty or so, It
is pretty good . to look upon, and she
eits down In her own cozy room and
thanks her lucky stars that marriage
is on the wane, -^i s Â¦>/Â¦
Then is more than apt to come the
blase age, and it is not what one would
call Â¦ either satisfactory or comforting.
Nothing Is absolutely pleasing. Con
tented? Perhaps, after a fashion, but
not absolutely so. There mujst be din
ners, teas, theaters, flowers, anything
to keep things up and humming, yet if
any one called her restless and un
happy she f would snap her fingers and
strenuously deny the 'allegation.
V She has no home life, and either de
votes her time, energy and talent to
her wbrk, to some one's else business,
or to having a rattling good time, and
what \vould Interest a blase woman of
35 would shave shocked ner beyond ex
pression at 20. #
anouts. wnat does she knqw of health,
heredity or social influences? She haa
been too busy wrestling with studies,
too busy attending dancing classes and
too busy having an altogether delight
ful time to ponder over life and its
many responsibilities. Each day as it
passes is the one day for her, and the
disappointments that chance her way
are heart-rending.
Besides all this, her ladyship has in
all probability delved into the family
library or nine times out of ten Into
the public one, and her head is filled
with all sorts of romantic notions, that
are certainly very pretty but not very
practical. She imagines that the man
who cuts a dash Is the one to be proud
of, and in her unsophisticated way flut
ters and colors every time he chances
to even so much as glance in her dlrec^
tlon. In fact, so much of a hold does
he gain on her that she follows blindly
where he chooses to lead, without
thinking or realizing) any thing but that
He is calling.
In a measure it is both the foolish
and the wise age. Certainly it is the
happiest age of all, and the wise old
saying. "Where Ignorance is bliss it la
folly to be wise," is particularlj
apropos. Of course, barring the possi
bility of going too far. Everything and
everybody is good, and, in fact, the
world is a highly delightful place to
be in.
But here comes the trouble of sweet
sixteen. She is too wise and refuses to
profit by the experienceSjOf those who
have learned a bit of wisdom by hard
knocks. She may be told that the man
who pleases her at sixteen is not likely
to be the one she would choose a few
years later. But would she believe it?
Certainly not, for she realizes that
there is plenty of happiness in the
world, and she has not yet awakened
to the fact that there is likewise quite
as much misery.
Young people are bound to be more or
less Impressionable and romantic, and
no matter how , closely they are
guarded it is bound to out. Let them
alone and their severe case of "puppy"
love dies a. natural death, but defy
them arid away they go rushlnc head-
long Into matrimonial snags, from
which there is no remedy.
It is for the world, and all like tha
small boy. who was left in charge of
hlg baby sister. "No, no; you mustn't
do that," and straightway the brow
beaten one . determined to do or die,
and when physically I restrained sobbed
out In a fit of rage that "he was Just
t'rylnV to boss her." â¢ .
And so It is with this half-grown-up
woman. She is Just being "bossed,"
and she don't , take the trouble to rea
son with herself that perhaps she Is
being saved a life of drudgery arid dis
content," which would. have been avoided
if she had only waited a few years arid
better equipped herself .for the struggles
and responsibilities that marriage is
bound "to. bring..
The girl of the early days ; married
young, It is true, , but the conditions
were vastly different; arid femininity
has changed not a little. In the time of

And how. much we may, learn '[ from

good sense in the clever" saying, ' "Ex-
t Â£ T T was worse than a crime,' it was
j a blunder." . Thus a sagacious
J[ yet kindly old gentleman was
wont to speak concerning his
own and other people's "mistakes, and
thus at times we all feel when disgust
ed and mortified. because of our failure
to do the proper thing at the right mo
ment or because of some painful 'error
in judgment, . some unwise move, some
stupid action.' The ' consequences/ of
these mistakes are 'Â¦ likely j. to ' follow*
swiftly, and; usually; cause us uneasy
moments, } not to say sleepless nights.
Somehow we feel a little different about
them than we do regarding our, actual
transgressions.' The Â¦ latter "may ' be
charged up against/ some j seductive
temptation, or we may; get them!for
given. But when we â¢â¢ have t ' done not a

remains with us we shall refuse to be
downed , by any ; past blunder, how
ever stupid. We shall become more
vigilant and discipline ourselves more
severely. As we trace many of our
mistakes to want of prudence and
forethought, to carelessness and for
ge tfulness,'. to .indifference '.' to our, per

tactical , error, but not necessarily a
fatal one. Men have been known to
recover from worse blows than this, al
though not often. For the first ten
years of Clarence's life they took turns
sitting up with him to see that he
didn't forget to breathe at the proper
intervals. He was never allowed to go
outside the house without one or the
other of his parents acting as a convoy,
and even then they insisted on pro
tecting nim from evil influences with
long blonde curls and a Lord Faunt
leroy top hamper. A boy who would in
sist on being bad in spite of the pro
'tection thus afforded would be a start
ling proof of the existence of infant de
pravity.
His education was applied at an in
stitution for the suppression pf natural
Instincts kept by a man who
would . have. . been a missionary
if he hadn't feared that his
tender susceptibilities would be too
much shocked by the style of dress,
or undress, in vogue among. savage
tribes. He was so gentle and modest
that even the mention of the naked
truth in his presence was likely to
cause moral convulsions of an alarm
ins type. The second edition of the
Knowit family library was intrusted
to the fostering care of this elderly
female in ; disguise, who was expected
to manicure the boy's intellect and
promptly suppress any symptoms of
masculinity. It was expected that four
or five years of this sort of thing would,
put the youngster in a proper, frame of
mind: to enter active life -without se
riously deranging the /court calendars
or overcrowding the county Jail.
-How-well the - new system 'Â¦ worked
may be judged from â¢ the simple state
ment that : Clarence at ; . the^ age of 20
was all that his name . entitled him
to be. 'He wore high collars and spec
tacles and a white tie and never ran,
for,:fear that he would bag his trous
ers at "the Iknee. The only subject on
Â¦which he wasa> 1 e to converse was the
relative merits of square and round-cut
coats and his staple literature was the
'-'Hints for Girls", column 'in the Shady
Home Journal. At last accounts he was
selling ribbons ;; and teaching the In
fant class in " Sunday, school.

the amount of valuable knowledge that
he had concealed about his person
could have, been taken up in an ordi
nary teaspoon without crowding. His
ultimate ,'destlny. was clearly the post

saloon- and- the only consolation that
his parents could extract from his ex

blessed fact that there was only one

THE one great thing that every
man knows everything about,
until he tries it for himself, is
bringing up children. The vi
carious method of child training
Is one of the simplest things known to
man; women aren't so sure of them
selves. All that is r->cessary is to as
sume at the outset that your brother
or your cousin or your neighbor or
your friend in Chicago is doing every
thing with his unfortunate offspring
that he should, not do and that the
fate of the. poor child will be an early
grave or th.> penitentiary. If you do
this you can be sure that you have
observed the first and only . rule ; in
long range paidolbgy. After you have
acquired one or two little olive
branches of your own the subject will
assume ; certain ' complicated aspects
that had not -presented themselves to
you before.
That was the experience of Mr.
Knowit and his good wife, although
Mrs. Knowit should be relieved of any
direct responsibility, in the matter. Mr.
Knowit's first theory, before ,he v had
had an opportunity to put it hv prac
tice, was that tne average American
parent was too gentle with his children.
A little dash of the good old Spartan
was what the kids needed, according
to this expert, authority. He /would
have had all- children brought up ,ac-"
cording to a uniform system, fn which
mere mothers should play a small' part
When the first installment of his fam
ily appeared on the scene he announced
that the newcomer should "be brought
up according to - the Â¦ most approved
principles of the- strenuous . school.
There was to be no, coddling or other
wise unnecessarily gentle treatment,
but the boy was to be taught all the
things that any ; well regulated . black
smith or member of a life-saving corps c
should know. To'the end that his mus
cles should be - properly . strengthened
and his powers , of self-preservation
thoroughly, developed he was to .be al
lowed Â¦; to yell as ] much as ; his infantile
desires dictated,* at any hour, of the day
or night. The nightly "promenade and
the frequent \ application ' of Â¦, the sooth
ing paregoric i were - strictly, interdicted
and . every effort Â¦ was / to be . made Â¦ to
bring the youngster.' to an early Â¦ reali
zation of the fact that he was more or
less afloat on a wide, wide sea. .
As soon as his ' son :' had â¢ arrived at
years which permitted him to navigate
it - w^iild probably be too late to do
him .any good by that time.
It is useless to follow the whole
course of Mr. Knowit's convolutions in
the? training of his first born. Being
a man, he, of course, . never suspected
that there was anything wrong- with
hIs N system until it was too late to
change it, thereby giving a ; very , black
eye to his theory of education >by expe
rience. If he had been trying to manu
facture a first-class prize fighter or a
fit subject for the solitary cell his ex
periment would have been a gllt-
an easy, course without a pilot he
was turned into the street, to learn
wisdom and other things by . contact
with the actual affairs of life. Mrs.
Knowit attempted to make a protest
at this stage of the .game and pointed
out the amount of undesirable knowl
edge that the youngster would prob
ably acquire, but she might as; well
have whispered her "inmost ; thoughts
into the ear of an Iowa cyclone in the
busy season. Her husband was so
sure that he knew just what was right
and why. that he : kept right on as
That he was not the only individual
"cut out" Miss Marshall learned im
mediately upon the return of the pair.
Fluttering about the piazza she dis
cerned them at the end of the street,
the bookkeeper hanging on the words
of his companion as no . amount of
mere appreciation of wisdom ever made
man hang on the words of woman.
Ewing was greatly embarrassed, too,
Â¦w ben he saw Miss Marshall, although
she tried to seem uninterested alike in
his presence and in his attention to the
blue-frocked girl to whom he presented
her. SsH*
Nevertheless, while presenUngan im
perturbable front to that part of the
world at Red Bank, she suffered keenly
the next few days. Miss Carruth and
her widowed mother occupied a cot
tage near the river, and between walk
ing, ridlng*and booating she and her
new admirer were together almost con
stantly.
This was the state of affairs when
a fire at the Carruth cottage upset
lied Bank and permitted to the book
keeper a display of courage which
seemed to write "finis*' to his ' ro
mance. The blaze broke out at dead
of night and gained such headway in
the front part of the dwelling that
there appeared scant probability that
the two inmates could be rescued. Red
Bank's volunteer fire brigade propped
its ladders against the veranda ~ be
fore the bedroom windows, but very
wisely refused to mount them through
the blast furnace of the blazing
porch.- Ewing went up one of them
like a toy monkey on a slick and car
ried both women to places of safety."
Miss Marshall who thought it
risky to be among- the spectators at a
fire, did not witness this . deed, but
she heard of It and her heart swelled
with pride. She had known ; all along
that Ewing was capable of just such
heroisnu her previous re
serve, she hastened to congratulate
Mm. bringing up, speechless and tear-
"Who? Nellie Carruth?" inquired
the youth addressed. "Looks as if I
was cut out, doesn't it?"
Ewing liked Miss Marshall, too, in a
patronizing sort of fashion, his regard
having been deepened considerably by
the discovery that she was mistress of
"double entry" and not at all averse
to double labor. His affection never
melted into words, and it was suf
ficiently adjustable to permit of being
put quite out of the way when its
possessor met so fluffy and alluring a
person as Nellie Carruth.
"Frank Ewing's gone with your girl
again," Miss Marshall heard an idler
remark banteringly to another as she
climbed the steps of the Globe Hotel.
She stopped to fumble a handker
chief out of her bar.
The ordinary, sensible woman of 32.
which was the exact age of Miss Mar
shall, probably would not have sym
pathized with her much concerning
this requirement. Ewing was just 28
and his "gray matter" was not gray
because of maturity or overexertion.
He was exceedingly good looking, ex
ceedingly tall and broad and debonair,
and these virtues appealed at once to
little -Miss Marshall, whose eyes were
accustomed to grayness of mind and
of other things.

QALLIE MARSHALL went to
Red Bank for her vacation al
l^^most entirely because Frank
X^ Ewing was there. To her friends
in the ?tfices of the American Opera
Chair Company she said that she felt
the quiet of the place to be what she
most needed. In point of fact, how
ever, what she most needed 'was the
love of the young bookkeeper, who
had dropped his pen a week before
with the avowed intention of rusti
cating at Red Bank.

for a chewed 'railroad ticket is not a

At last, after what seemed to be
hours of waiting,* he caught sight of
a blue coat and brass buttons in the
far end of the car, and a moment later
he began to choke. The traveling man
across the aisle pounded him upon the
_back and presently his gasps^, subsided.
"What's the matter?" demanded the
conductor, coming up, whereon Dan let
out a wail that would have shamed the
whistle of the powerful engine.
"I swallowed most of. me ticket," he
sobbed, "an* now I gotter walk all the
way to Pittsburg."
Sundry bits of pasteboard on the
floor furnished corroborative evidence,
but- the conductor was adamant.
"The gateman told me you had a
ticket to Newark," he declared firmly.
"You get off there."
"He's a liar," protested Dan, "and
so're y6u."
(Copyright. 1004. .' by T. C. McClure.)

The drummer turned to Dan. "Your
fare. is paid," he said. "On the level,
where was your ticket for?"
"Newark," admitted Danny, "but dat
big stiff didn't know."
Jack Somers laughed lightly.
"Going to sit ud all night?" .asked
Somers, as he saw the Pullman con
ductor at the other end of the car.
"Naw," said Dan, contemptuously.
"Well," the other returned, "I guess
I can get a place in the sleeper, but
I'll come and take you in the diner
when it's time," and with that he fol
lowed the conductor down the aisle
and on to the car where a berth had
been found after the reservations had
been checked up.
He was as-g-ood as his word about
the dinner. The idea of a whole dollar
The conductor sized up the traveling
man and became diplomatic. "I can't
let him ride," he declared apologeti
cally. "He's got to have a ticket or
he can't stay on the train."
"Two to Pittsburg," said the drum
mer, producing his mileage book.
The conductor punched two slips and
passed on. If a passenger wanted to
be taken in it wafe none of his business,
especially when the passenger was al
most six feet.
The conductor made a grab at his col
lar, but the drummer interfered.
"Don't get gay with the kid," he
said. "You know very well yon are
not telling the truth when you say that
you . know where his ticket is for."
"No," smiled the magnate, guess
ing at \he meaning of "nig." "I tusx
wanted to say I have a place in my

the tale was done. "He can have her "
With a whoop Dan was down the
hall. Greyson called him back.
"Ain't going ter ,'nig/ are yer." de
manded Dan su3*plciously as b.Â»
came up. 1^039Hk|
With a slight draft on his imagina
tion, he told the old man of how Som
ers had helped him to Pittsburg and
how. when he was selling papers In
New York, he had seen Somers often,
and how the man had done none of
the things with which he had been
charged by other interested parties
There was the ring of truth in his
tones, and the old man relented - He
was accustomed to forming his own
judgment, and he would accept evei.
the statement of a ragged newsboy If
it seemed to him right.
"G'wan. yer old geezer," retorted
Dan; "did yer s'pose I'd break a fren*
like that? I wanter tell yej* you're
nutty about Mr. Somers; he's an all
righter. Didn't I .see a dame try ter
win him out In N'York, and didn't he

"Fer a friend of mine," completed
Dan. "Y'see, Paul Somers was on de

him. I hearn him tell *er you kicked
because he was no good. Say! Dat's
dead wrong."
"Do you mean to say that my
daughter was with young- Somers yes
terday?" demanded Greyson. forget
ting for the moment to whom he was
talking.
' "I was right behind 'em," declared
Dan:
Greyson produced a $10 bllL "Here's
something for your trouble," he said,
"if you see them together again let
me know and you may have another."
"Nixey," he said decidedly. "When I
want cash I earns it. I want your
daughter."
'â¢My daughter!" repeated the aston
ished Greyson. looking about to see
what help might be- at hand.
Henry Greyson was known every
where In Pittsburg. The Greyson
building was one of the most modern
structures, and Greyson's interests
were as varied as they were* enor
mous. It was an easy matter to find
his office, but a lot more difficult to
get at the man. Dan waited from
11 in the morning- to 3 in the after
noon and then, from a side door
around the corner of the hall from
the main office the spare, alert figure
of the millionaire stepped out. Dan
pounced upon him.
"Say, Mr. Greyson." he demanded,
plunging into the midst of the busi
ness. "I come to ask ye a favor."
Greyson's hand went to his trous

The girl was old Henry Greyson's
daughter â he found that out â and
Greyson objected to Somers because
he thought him fast â the old type of
drummer. It was evident that Somers
took the matter as much to heart as
did the girl and Dan was quite dis
gusted over the state of affairs.
It was evident that things were not
as they would have them, for the talk
that tloated back to Dan's keen ears
told him that her father objected ta
Somers, and that this was a clandes

"Don't butt in," was one of Dan's
rules and he was lost in the crowd at
the . trolley terminal before Somers
had had a chance to recognize hia

and the green grass was a most pleas
ant carpet, but the talk on the trolley
rang in Dan's ears.

Manifestly, Miss Marshall had been
unjust in considering her a mere doll.
One evening soon after, however,
when she was. sitting at her window
looking into the mist of her life, she
was given reason to resurrect her first

proposing marriage. The woman up

her throat and she could, not move

been taken from his face. The brand

furniture was even more expensive at

She was too intent on sport to hear
a little stifled laugh. Indeed she had

but the matter In hand. She had cast
a little way from where the trout
brokeâ for perhaps two minutes the
float lay aggravatingly Â« expressionless,
simply drifting a bit In the eddy of
the pool. Then it went under with a
rushâ to come up two yards away, and

swallowed the hook.
Alicia did not try to haul him in at

with a rush that must have bewildered

were chattering happily.

end everything, do you?"
The girl arose.
"I came up here to be alone," shÂ»
said. "It is evident I must seek soli

He jumped to his feet'
"I'll go," he said. "You may ' have
the cliff to yourself. But - before I
leave I want to ask you a favor. When

He stopped" and looked at her.'
"Oh,' well." he said contritely,"lt was
all my fault anyway. I have no right
-to ask favors. Good-by."
He moved down the windlnj path.
The blackberry vines caught/ at his
clothes, but he forgot to curse them.
Half-way down the path he heard' rapid
footsteps behind him. He.' turned and
beheld the girl hurrying after him. Her
face was crimson and her eyes refused
to meet his.
"What's up?" he asked her cheerfully.
"Oh." she said, "Iâ I tried to bury

"This particular, nook is of my dis

' "Possession * is nlno points â¢ of the

The girl's eyes looked . across the
valley to the ragged '. line of hills, over,
which fleecy bits of white clouds drift
ed lazily. Her, parasol was - tapping
nervously an exposed root of the flr.
"Do you mind telling me why you

asked. . â¢ : â¢
"For' the same reason a murderer Is

to her.suddenly and his face was grave.
"Why did you come?" he asked.
. "I wanted to beâ to be alone with my

"You're sure 'It's 'dead?" he asked.

The girl sighed. HBM
"It is dead f- stone dead." . she said
with a touch of sadness in her voice.
"I thought,", he i remarked, "that love

Only a blind track ran past the up

out, not even the most Inveterate fish
ermen who might be lured by this ex

made Alicia want to sing.,; She did not
do it, being firmly of opinion that fish
have ears and are. mighty, wary .'of hu
man sounds. And to-day she was.bent

Madame Blair had an eye to the main

had broken up the affair between Alicia

but then Alicia would have plenty for

Naturally she resented Redmond and
all his works. Quite- as naturally she
had inveigled the coy yet willing Susan
into this *ong visit, with a set purpose
of flinging the pair at each other's
heads, and If possible compassing an
engagement before a fortnicht passed.
The creek was less than half a mile
awayâ with Blair fields on either side
of It. Alicia knew every bend and rip

she knew them. She meant to^flsh first

"full membership." .. \ Â¦',%
It was on a" Saturday morning, a
month or more after- Columbia had
been received into full membership,
that the ' children were playing to
gether in the garden.
"I guess I'll go wadln* this after
noon," John Philip announced, "Aunt
Rachel would just worry if I told her,
and daddy won't be home for lunch,
bo I can't ask him." . â¢ â¢ -
"I'm 'fraid you'll be drown-ded,
dear," the little mother said anxious
ly (John Philip did not object to
"dearing" in private), "an' I don't be
lieve you'd better go." $&Â£Z$Â§f4
"Pooh!'', John Philip rejoined. "You
ain't my mother. I ain't had a mother
since I was born."
"No," she sighed, "If you had a real
ly, truly one, I guess | you'd have to
mlnti. Your, father might get you one."
John Philip grinned. ."He's too busy,"
he said, "but I know one I'd like to. get.
Last summer we was down ( at Cove
Inlet three weeksâ daddy an' meâ an'
there was a Jolly nice, girl there, an'
we liked her awful well â daddy an' me
â an' we took, her picture one day â
snap shotâ 1 mean daddyfdld. He's got
it yet;, 'come up to his Â» room, an' I'll
hunt for it."' .
The children flew into the house, and
up to Mr. Brown's* sitting-room. Be
hind, a tall vase John Philip found the
oDject "of his -search. . For a moment
Columbia- gazed . at it with wondering
eyes. "Why, it's" her!?', she shouted,
with more force than grammar. "It's
my Miss Curtis! She lives near thÂ«
home. 'Course she's awful -nice!" Bhe
gazed long and; lovingly at .the picture.
"Say," Bhe said at last, "a'pose we get
her for, your, mother?"
Thereupon followed a discussion of
ways and means, and it was not until
after luncheon that the committee of
two set forth in quest of a mother for
John Philip. It was a very startled and
amazed young lady who . listened to
their plea. ', It was Columbia who of
fered the most persuasive argument.
"He hasn't anybody.' hut his, Aunt
Rachel and his father," she said plead*
ingly, "an* he keeps your picture back
of a vase, an' "
"Who keeps my picture?" Miss Cur
tis interrupted, her sweet face flush
ing a rose red.
"Why, John Philip's father," Colum
bia explained. "I s'posa you didn't
know 'bout it, then?"
"No, I didn't know," she said. "I
didn't know!" she repeated to herself
again and again.
"Now vou know, an* won't you
come, please?" It was John Philip
who pleaded now. Miss Curtis stoop
ed and took his freckled little face be
tween her slender white hands. "I'll
think of It, dear," she promised, "but
it will be better not to mention your
â your proposal to your father."
John Philip did not agree with her,
and that very evening, he broke the
news to his unsuspecting father. Co
lumbia, with rare delicacy, had de
clined to be present.
"Daddy,'.* John Philip said bluntly,
"I asked "herâ Columbia an* me."
Philip Brown "looked up from his
paper. He was - a fine specimen of
"Don't you want her?" the little fel
low Bald, struggling manfully to keep
back the tears. "I said I was suro you
wanted her,; same as I*dld." '
"What did she say?" The question
came from between whits lips.
"She didn't ' know you had ' her plo
ture till Columbia told her. * She said
she'd think about It, but I'd better not
tell you I'd asked her toâ" Â¦
But John Philip was talking, to ths
empty air; his father was out of the
room before tho last sentence was
finished. Ha had seized his hat and
vanished.
"Gee!"- John Philip said to himself,
"we've done It now. I guessâColum
bia an' me!" ...
They had. Th* bride and rroom
said so on their wedding day. John

the knot was being tied, but, strange
to say, the bride-elect objected. - .

clean of heart, and still on "the- sunny
side" of forty.
"Asked whom?/* ha Bald, "Asked
what?"
"Miss Curtis, .you know. Iâ I asiad
her to be my mother."
Philip Brown sat up very straight.
and stared at his small son and heir.
exclaimed eagerly. "There's too many
of us now and â " '
"Well." Mrs. Noah Interrupted,
"you can stay to breakfast, and then
I'll go wkh you to the home." The
child had crept thus quickly into a
warm corner of the grim lady's heart.
She was eating her oatmeal when
John Philip's father came down to
breakfast, and â¢ asked so kindly,
rrWhose little girl is this?" that Co
lumbia's heart went out to him then
and there. ?Â¦
"I don't know." she said slmplv in*
reply to his question, "they, ain't found
out yet at the -home, but I know how
old I am; I'm going on seven; I'm lit
tle, but maybe I'd do for him," she
nodded cheerily at John Philip, "till
he gota really, truly one."
"A really, truly what?" Mr. Brown
asked smilingly.
"Why, a mother, of course. I
learned how to be one from Mis'
Jones â she has eight children â she
lives near the home. You 'just help
'em be good, an' they will, 'cause you
love 'em bo. It's awful nice to have
a mother," she said wistfully. "I
asked Tommy Jones if he didn't
think so. an' he said, 'Sure thing!' "
John Philip tried to scowl, but his
forehead refused to pucker, and when
his father said, "Shall we let her
adopt you," my son?" he laughed out
right. "We â we â might give her a
try," he stammered.

"Cohrmbi?. â Columbia .Farley. She
eays that's her name, ma'am, an' she's
from the Orphans' Homeâ a little
mite of a. thins, an* that funny!" Here
Susan retired ;isain behind her apron.
"What docs she want?" Mrs. Noah
asked grimly.
".Well, ma'am,"* Susan exploded,
"she wants to stay."
'"Stay?" her mistress repeated
blankly, while John ''Philip/ unre
proved, squirmed with delight. Hero
was something doing at last!
"Yes'm.'* Susan went on, "she's
hafl her eye on this house, she says.
for s. long time, but Jt wa'n't till this
morning that she decided she'd live
with you. .She's settin* on her satchel
out in the kitchen."
Mrs. Noah fairly snorted "with as
tonishment and indignation. "Much
obliged to her, I'm sure," she said
sarcastically, "and may I ask what de
cided her In our favor?"
"It was John Philip, ma'am," Susan
said, choking with laughter. "She â
the says she wants to be a mother to
him." â¢
John Philip's face matched his hair
in color now; even the freckles took
on a livelier red. "Consarn her," ha
taid under his breath.
"Any more?" his aunt asked, with
the air of one prepared for the worst.
"Yes'm; she asked what your name
was, an' when I said 'Mrs. Noah* she
was that surprised. She said she'd
heard about you an' Mr. Noah at Sun
day school, but she had no idee you
was livin' yet."..-.' \.
"Anything more? My oatmeal is
getting cold. Don't stand there gig
gling like an idot."
"She wondered how old you was,
ma'am, an' when I said I didn't know
ehe thought she could tell by lookin'
at your teeth, like the hired man at
the home done when he bought a'
horse."
A great wave of color rolled over
Mrs. Noah's face, and broke on the
beach of "spit curls" outlining her
high forehead. "Bring her in," she
cald, closing her thin lips tightly over
her "store" teeth.
Susan disappeared, and a moment
later ushered "Columbia Parley" Into
the august presence or her mistress.
Bhe was truly "a mite of a thing,"
with great, dark eyes, and a most en
gaging smile.
"How do you do, Mrs. Noah?" she
Â¦aid, holding out her hand In a quaint,
old-fashioned way. To John Philip's
surprise, his aunt took the little hand
In hers. <
"So you'd like to live here?" she said,
not unkindly.
"Yet, awful well! Don't you need
me?" she asked naively.
"I think not." Mrs. Noah said â very
gently for her â "and besides I couldn't
take you 'without the consent of the
matron at the home."

The King's friendship for LaSy Saville dates back many years prior
to her marriage to Baron Saville when she was plain Mrs. Helyar. She
is a' petite woman, with abundance of golden hair In which few sliver
threads have yet appeared, and, of course, witty and vivacious or she
would not have been so long numbered among the King's friends. She Is
not one 'of the great entertainers of London, but.the King is a frequent
guest at her "little dinners." Lady, Gerard, whose only son will become of
age this autumn, is another of. the King's old friends who has discovered
the secret of preserving her youthful good looks. She recently enter
tained the King at Eastwell Park and Mrs. George Keppel was one of
The King has numerous other friends, but those enumerated will suf
fice'to show that in his selection of them he exercises the widest range
of 'choice. ~ r
Another woman who also enjoys the distinction of being a great favorite
with both the King and Queen is Mrs. Willie James, whose husband Is of
American descent. She is a pretty little woman with frizzled hair and
wears glasses, but she is a brilliant talker, a clever amateur actress and an
enthusiastic yachtswoman, which makes her a welcome guest on board the
royal yacht That she plays a good hand at bridge goes without saying.
James himself, though chiefly known to fame as the husband of his accom
plished wife, is of versatile character, the possessor of great Inherited wealth
and a mighty hunter of big game.
That the King esteems old women as friends, as well as young ones,
is shown by the fact that among his guest3 for the Goodwood week this
year was Miss Jane Thornewill, "old Miss Jane" as she is generally re
ferred to in society. But Miss Thornewill is keen on bridge. That she
happens to be .a sister of Lady Burton of Bass has nothing to do with
the King's liking for her. Another elderly woman who Is on very friendly
terms with the King is the Duchess, of Devonshire. But the Duchess la
one of the grand ladies of England, and her husband one of the most
distinguished peers of -the realm. At Chatsworth House they are able to
entertain royalty right royally.
ANOTHER KOYAL FAVORITE.
Mrs. Cornwallls West, formerly Lady Randolph Churchill, and before
that Miss Jerome of New York, Is another Instance of the King's loyalty to
his old friends, though since she took unto herself a second husband so much
younger than herself she has not been so often seen at the country houses
which he visits. Lady Curzon for a time was not In the King's good books
because of the reports sent home from India that she gave herself more
airs than were justified even by her rank as the wife of the Viceroy, but
since her return she has been fully restored to the royal favor, as was evi
denced by the fact that the King stood sponsor at the christening of her
youngest baby.
Among English women who figure prominently as friends of the Kins
the most conspicuous and, for many reasons, the most Interesting, is Mrs.
George Keppel. With far more Justification' than in the case of Cavendlsh-
Bentinck might the phrase "nobody in particular" be applied to Mr. Keppel.
He has a business billet of some sort with Sir Thomas Llpton. who makes
things as easy as he can for him and always allows him a holiday when his
wife is helping to entertain the King. Mrs. Keppel Is generally considered
the prettiest of the King's women friends. She is certainly the poorest.
But she treats her povertyâ her comparative povertyâ as a Jest and has
often threatened to write a book entitled "How to Enjoy Life and Entertain
Royalty on Five Hundred Pounds a Year."
He cares nothing for women who cannot "frivol" a bit. Feminine blua
stockings he abhors. He may publicly applaud women with missions who
make a success of them, but in private they bore him. He seeks society
for pleasure, relaxation andâ bridge; not for serious discussion. Ho gets
enough of that when attending to his business as a King.
That among the King's friends there should be bo many American
women has given rise to no little bitterness and Jealousy In aristocratic
circles. But these daughters of the United States owe their distinction en
tirely to the fact that as a rule they are bright, tactful, attractive and
good talker and esteem .their birthright too highly to be flustered by the
attentions of royalty. They are too well known on the other side to need
more than a passing mention of some of them here.
Consuelo, Duchess of Manchester, the Dowager Duchess, has for many
years been regarded by the King as one of his stanchest friends, which
is proof that in such matters he Is not fickle- She is getting on in life, but
is still a brilliant woman and retains much of the youthful beauty which
as Miss Yznaga made her famous In America. Her name oftener than that
of many younger women appears among the list of guests at big house par
ties gathered to entertain the King. That other Consuelo, the Duchess of
Maryborough, has often played the hostess to the King, though she is gen
erally regarded as one of the Queen's special friends rather than his Ma
jesty's. The reigning Duchess of Manchester, formerly" Miss Helen Zim
merman of Cincinnati/though she cannot be classed among his close
friends Is distinctly "persona grata" with the King. She would have had
the honor of entertaining both the King and Queen at Kylempre Castle had
the place been ready for occupancy on the occasion of the royal visit to
Ireland.
DEMANDS FRIVOLITY.
This is the King's holiday season, when tie visits big country houses
and invites his friendsâ and more particularly his women friends â to
meet him and help him enjoy himself. Nominally, of course, it Is his
hosts who issue the invitations, but, as everybody knows, it is the King
himself who supplies the lists of the people whom he wishes to meet.
In many matters the King's actions are so circumscribed by cere
mony and the rigorous etiquette pertaining to a court that he has far less
freedom of choice than most of his subjects. But he can choose- his
friendsâ both male and femaleâ and especially with regard to the latter
he exhibits a far more catholic taste than is shown by many of the
heads of the nobility. Some of the feminine intimates are rich, others
are comparatively poor; some have titles, others have none; some are
married and some are single; some are young and some are old.; many
are strikingly handsome women, but not. a few never had any preten
sions to beauty.
' That latter statement may rather surprise some American readers who
Jn. former- days, qyhen the King was ths Pririce.of Wales, with a worse repu
tation for galiaritry than perhaps he deserved, heard his name so frequently
linked with those of reigning belles and professional beauties. But it should
be borne in mind that he Is now 63 and at that age, when the blood begins
to run cold, beauty 1 no longer constitutes an overpowering attraction. Nor
that he is indifferent to it by any means, and other things being equal he
still gives the preference to the pretty facea, but for many years it could
no longer be truthfully said of him that he bestowed his friendship only
on pretty women. The things that he does insist on are wit and vi
vacity.
Considering that he is a descendant of the great ducal family of
Portland, that he is a wealthy man and was for ten years a member of
Parliament, it is rather rough on Cavendish-Bentlnck to be described as
"nobody in particular," but it Is thÂ© fate of many Englishmen, who mar
ry American women to be known thereafter merely as the husbands of
their wives, particularly, as often happens, when those same wives are
singled out as the objects of royal attention.
Before her marriage in 1880 Mrs. Cavendish-Benflnck was Miss Vio
let Livingston, a daughter of Maturin Livingston of Staatsburgh, N. T.
"When she came to England she astonished people by the rapidity with
which she scored social successes and rose to the top of the swell set.
but she had three strong cards to. play â beauty, wit and money â and she
knew how to make each one of them count. Her town residence Is in
Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, near the Houses of Parliament, and when
she lay 111 there some years ago "Big Ben," the famous Parliamentary
clock, was muffled for fear that Its noise might disturb her. That was
pretty strong evidence both of her popularity and what in America
would be called her "pull."
LONDON. Oct. 22. â "King Edward's partiality for American women
was again shown recently . when, to the chagrin of many titled folk who
were eager to entertain him in grand style, he slipped off for a week
end holiday to Highcliffe Castle, near Christchurch. Hants, as the guest
of George Cavendlsh-Bentlnck. For, as one paper frankly stated, "Mr.
Cavendish-Bentlnck is nobody In particular, but his American wife is a
great favorite of his Majesty's and one of the brightest society women
of the day."
His iyiajesty Insists, However, on Wit
and Skill at Bridge Whist.

LON3X)N, Oct. 22. â The dog doctor
h&s "been for a number of years a fa
miliar figure in society- â in- fact, no
"doggy" family could get along with
out him. His place in the household
was almost on a par with that of the
family surgeon or physician and his
income was in many cases higher.
Following Queen Alexandra's exam
ple, however, many society "women
have discarded the bow-wow to make
room for pussy, TÂ»ith the result that
the "dog doctor" has, in many cases,
fallen on evil times. But he is a re
sourceful man- He has discovered
that cats suffer from many of the
complaints that were supposedly con
fined to dogs and he has actually
made "catty" women believe that if
their cats are not "vaccinated" they
are liable to catch some disease after
the nature of smallpox.
He has discovered an antitoxin that
will save the feline family from con
tracting the infection. The method
employed 4Â» to - inject the ' serum - be-~
r.eath the skin of pussy by means of
a. needle-pointed syringe.
During the last few days a "profes
sor" has been operating on the
"Queen's cats, but it was not before he
was able to show her Majesty that
cats of lower stations in life had ben
efited from the treatment that she
allowed her pets to be "punctured."

"To-day is a memorable one In tho
history of Arcata, for it is one from
which will spring the inspiration for
future improvements in forestry in
your midst. Arbor day has been cb
eerved in many places in our glorious
State through the efforts of the Na
tive Daughters and the Native Sons
of the Golden West. In many places
special trees have been planted in par
ticular places, such as parks and pub
lic roads, to inspire the 1 community
that something should be done to re
pair the waste that occurs in the for
ests in obeying the command of com
merce. Certainly, In this beautiful
county, where bo much of the forest
is utilized, there should be an organized
effort to Insure the planting of tree3
to replace those removed bo that the
ccunty may not be robbed of its great
industry and magnificent beauty.
"In many places the owners of vast
estates plant groves each year and
every few years after that have timber
that may be cut down to supply the
demand for firewood. By 'doing this
they not only do that which draws nec
essary moisture to the sun-parche-1
earth, but they obtain immense re
turns for the Investment. In Califor
nia we need a regular system of tree
planting in order to replace the for
ests that are laid low by the wood
man's ax and hold back the evil .of de
nuded hillsides, that nature may deck
them yearly with verdure and lloral
grandeur. While It is true that trees
absorb a great deal of moisture, it is
equally true that their spacious limbs
and foliage prevent the evaporation of
the waters and preserve them to us
for irrigation purposes- California and
Nevada are specially interested along
these lines and Congress has done
much for these two States in setting
aside large forest reserves in the high
Sierras. While all this has been done
we cannot forget the fact that tree
planting and the sowing of wild flower
seeds in California was initiated by
Junior Past Grand President Eliza D.
Keith and it is to her that we owe the
interest our order has taken in that
direction. All honor to those Native
Daughters who have beautified the
State in their particular sections by
tree planting and the development of
California's beautif'-' flowers.
"The tree we dedicate to-day is of
the variety known as pittosporum,"
6aid the grand president, and as she
took a Epade decorated with the colors
of the order and threw a shovelful of
earth over the roots of the tree she ad
ded: "I dedicate this tree in the name
of the Native Daughters of the Golden
West to the city of Arcata and name it
Winona for the parlor under whose
auspices it is planted. May its shade
protect young and old from the sever
ity of the rays of the sun, and as calm
and sunshine crosses it may it so grow
that those who Eeek rest beneath Its
umbrageous foliage shall enjoy sun
shine and shade. This spade I now turn
over to the keeping of the president of
the improvement club and may it
prove an inspiration to future tree
planting in Arcata and vicinity, and
may this tree, as it grows, ever remind
all who shall look upon it of the earn
est efforts of the Native Daughters of
the Golden West to preserve to future
generations the beautiful forests of our
native land."
On behalf of the city of Arcata the
president of the club accepted the tree
and save assurance that it shall ever
be guarded with Jealous care in remem
brance of Grand President Ella E.
Caminetti and of Winona Parlor, N. D.

that was as sincere as it was gener

exemplification of the work which for
precision and effectiveness in delivery
has never been surpassed In any sub
ordinate. "In fact," said one who wit
nessed the work, "I never before had
an idea that our ritual was so beauti
ful." After the work of the evening
each of the officers named had some

did all it could to make the visiting
officials appreciate the fact that they
were truly â¢welcome. "The loyalty of
the members and their kindness makes
one feel," said the grand president,
"that It is a pleasure to be at the head
of such a body of women." During

Mr. Aberley, who kept a saloon as well
as a theater, used partly to discharge
his obligations to his actors. After

dancing turns, Irishmen, 'Dutchmen,
Frenchmen, all sorts of characters,
ending up with the musical comedy
kind of thing in which he has found
so much distinctionâ for that is ex
actly what J^ames T. Powers has
found.
They wanted him here on the stage
and I went into the wing3 to watch
him. It is when Li comes into the
Emperor's palace with Yen How's mes
sage. The messenger finds himself in
hot water and tries to escape. And
oh, the deftness of it all, the clean,
sure, workmanlike touch of it. Not a
stroke too much in the picture, not a
blur or a blot in the line. And the
shading, as delicate and subtle as a
bit of CoQuelin comedy.
"I think I've found out just what
makes you, you," I said as the com
edian came oft.
"They all seem to speak of that," he
said, "well?"
"You take the funny thing serious
ly," I hazarded.
"Perhaps that's It," eaid Mr. Powers.
"Thank you. . I do. I really work
awfully hard. And as to taking it seri
ouslyâwell, take that last scene. LI is
frightened. But I could get bigger
laughs by making him in a bigger funk,
exaggerating, with horseplay. But
that Is not what I want. I try to act
the part as much as possible â "
"Ah, it's the difference between bur
lesque and comedy â "
"Precisely," he nodded. "And as I
said, I've really worked very hard with
the partâ with everything. Would you
think it took me just one week to find
out how to fix this queue for the Irish
policeman I do? Fact. You see"âillus
tratingâ"this way it slipped, that way

Powers turned swiftly aside, then look

Chinese queue, suit and all.
"It Isn't easy to be funny," he en-
"Mrs. Powers is also an actress?" I
asked, following her husband's admir
ing glance after her.
"Yes, indeed." Mr. Powers replied.
Â¦with no attempt to conceal his pride.
"Mrs. Powers has been with me in
many of my productions, but she has
-lately been quite 111."
Something else he said here, but I
was by then in the thick of the won
derful Li make-up. You will remem
ber it. The strongest opera glasses
had failed to betray its mysteries. I
knew well Mr. Powers' own round
Â«yed, flexible-lipped countenance.
How he had so slanted the Li eyes,
that dip cunningly into the nose and
lift slyly to the temples, I could only
guess. It was hardly easier to dis
cover close to. Even there they looked
as though the comedian had slit them
up with a knife.
"How did you do it" I asked, lean-
Ing forward to examine the picture.
"Mustn't look so close." the artist
advised. "I'm made up for that dis
tance," nodding at the mirror some
five feet away.
But I had time to take In the
weird, slick artistry of the thingâ
the clever white streak that cuts off
the upper corner of the eye, the ver
milion triangle that dips It into the
nose, the sharp, sure line that lifts
it into the temple, the eloquent
orientalism of the eyebrow, and even
cleverer, perhaps, the throwing up of
the cheekbone and the like by means
of light and shade used as the painter
uses them, the whole as good a bit
of walking ivory as ever called "las
bellies."
"You did not learn to do that in a
day.," I remarked.
"I did not," Mr. Powers acknowl
edged, rising to pull out the newspa
pers that stuffed his trousers. "These
are things I'm supposed to have
stolen." he laughed, "and will you per
mit me?"
His wig came off with thatâ I'm not
going to tell what was or was not un

me that he was "just frightened to

"heavy" named Brannigan that could
say "liar!" "louder than- even For

"liar!" to say he would insert it. For
tumbling a bucketful of wet paper
from the files on Mr. Brannigan's face
as he came up from a trap door, young

He made it straight with the injured

said. 'Yes, you cart/ he said. And I
knew he knew. Daly always knew."
"Daly always knew," was the key of
the little eulogy that followed. Four
years with him Mr. Powers had,
years of inspiration and encourage

erest of managers he enlarged upon,
his habit <of leaving the actor, as far as
possible, free to follow out his own
ideas. "But he was born for the thea

in the smell and hurry of it. I used to
try to get him out on fine days, but,, he
would take the limelight Instead of tha
sunlight every time."
"It strikes me that you, too, were
born for the theater, Mr. Powers."
"Never wanted to do anything else,"
the comedian confessed, "though I did
try-"
I wish I could set down the drollery
of his chuckle as he said it, the fun
lurking in the corners of his big, ex
pressive mouth. He put up a delight
fully silly finger to his chin to con
tinue: "You know mamma did not ob

she druv me to it. I suppose she
thought it would be cheaper. I used
to use up the furniture for props, and

A veritable forest of manzanlta had

in the corridors of the first and second

plight love's promise could be conjured

Both great floors were in floral at

But shall it be bridge or poker?
Whichever it be, how long and how
much should it be flayed? Should
it be an object of existence, or merely
an incident of it? â tea-time topics for
unbury people.
To be sure, all devotees of cards
are not their slaves. To such as are
the shackles are ! welded fast, but to
these to whom "playing cards" is play
ing, thfn the spotted bits of card
board fulfill a pleasant mission. Then
It's lun. and erood fun.
What of the physician who's called
up betimes for a case of nerves and
palpitating heart and a frightened
husband? Ah! madam?, ask your
physician what he think? of daily
sessions nt bridge, or poker, or 500 â
sessions that know no recess save that
Interjected by a rude dinner hour, or
by the persistency of the sun rising
upon an unfinished game.
Now here is a vital question, aug
mented by the matter of gaming for
money. Npw, it's true that cards
without an incentive, as represented
in prizes â cash or merchantables â is
stupid and dull. But what of the ten
sity caused by the striving? What of
the pain of losing money that could
111 afford to be lost? Household
money, for instance? What of the
cent per cent man â and there are
women usurers, too â who feast and
grow fat upon the card-playing
women who have the unutterable
taste to play away money they can't
afford â and lose it.
As yet bridge holds sway in San
Francisco â but surely when 'tis bruit
<*d abroad that bridge is provincial. Its
popularity must wane. San Francisco
cannot afford to do anything that
savors of provincialism â no new com
munityânor individualâ can. How
ever, while the investigation commit
tee is seeking evidence for the con
demnation of bridge, the old favorite
Â¦will be played just as of old.
But the day of poker, with its
"kitty," its 'three of a kind" and Its
accidents with aces. Is at hand.
But whether it be bridge or poker,
what proportion of time, essentially
daytime, should be given to either?
And thus Is poker regnant over
boudoir tables, likewise over the li
brary fetes, where the festive game
sters speed the fleeting hours with
royal flushes, calling bluffs and va
rious other intensities that cause cash
to change pockets â and friends to
change opinions.
Bridge, or shall it be poker? Now
poker is the proper caper over In
London, where bridge is thought to
be quite provincial. While at one
tfme enjoying princely favor, it has,
like manv another royal favorite, been
relegated to desuetude. And bridge is
forced to soliloquize, with dethroned
beauties and statesmen, "Alas! for
the evanescence of princely honors!"

"In closing we think it well to call
your attention to the peculiarly infor
mal nature of the award of the con
tract under which these bills are pre
sented. The contract was awarded to
F. M. Yorke & Company on July 14,
1904. Mr. Yorke testified that at that
time F. M. Yorke & Company was a
partnership, consisting of himself and
P. M. Gopcevich; that though no for
mal written articles of agreement had
been made between them they had an
oral understanding â¢ for a partnership.
The bills are presented by F. M. Yorke
& Company, a corporation, which the
records show "was organized only on
July 29, 1904, or some two weeks after
the award of the contract.' Mr. Yorke
testified that all the stock in this com
pany was hejd by Gopcevich and him
self and that after the award of the
contract they proceeded to purchase
their plant. The Informality of per
mitting a corporation to perform work
under a contract awarded to a partner
ship is clear. This does not, however,
call for anything more than criticism
and a suggestion to the Board of Public
Works that a like informality will not
be permitted In the future.
"For the reasons given we have con
cluded not to allow these bills of F. M.
"No ;â supervision is exercised either
over Boone's Inspection of the work or
over his computations thereof. He af
fixes' his O. K. to the- bills,', which he
makes' but' tfohVhia 'i/own'?' 'Unverified'
computations, and the other officials,
through whose, bands the bills pass,
affix their signatures thereto, relying
upon his signature. Comment upon
such a condition of affairs would be
idle. It is eloquent of inefficiency and
of opportunity for abuse and imposi
tion, without measure, upon the city.
"There is no law that permits a
practice of the kind and it is obvious
that an injustice has been done to the
city and to possible bidders, through
whose bids the city might profit, there
fore it is necessary for us to condemn
it out of hand as intolerable. If the
specifications of the contract da not
meet with precision the actual condi
tion of affairs, it is the duty, of. the
Board of Public. Works to reconstruct
those 'specifications so as to conform
with that condition. Obviously the city
is at the mercy of its officers and de
prived of the benefit of fearless com
petitlon'in bidding. .Injustice is dealt
out to It by the arbitrary exercise 'of
this discretion by the Inspector, acting
under instructions of higher officials,
that everything may work to. the profit
of the contractor. It is an absolutely
inconceivable and illogical rule even of
discretion that gives the contractor ad
ditional compensation for depth in ex
cess of the specifications and makes
no deduction from his charge iii favor
of the city for a surface of less depth
than that required by those specifica
tions. ? â¢

The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday filed its report with the
board. It says that it has decided,
after a long and detailed investigation,
not to approve the August bills of the
F. M. Yorke Company for repairs to
bituminous streets. The bills were for
an aggregate amount of $6264 20. The
report goes into the evidence adduced
at the investigation, which the
committee concludes that the maxi
mum output of the kettles used by the
company for the month of August was
only sufficient to cover 81,000 square
feet of bituminous pavement, which, at
four cents per* square foot, the con
tract price, would amount to $3240,
whereas the bills were for. almost
double that amount. The report also dis
cusses the inadequacy of the Bupervl
sion of the work and the instructions
given to Inspector Boone by Commis
sioners Schmitz and ' Maestretti to be
reasonable in \ his computations as to
surface covered where the depth of the
bitumen exceeded 2& inches. The re

of felony embezzleme'nt. He is 24
years of age. His father, James M.

ous good .character. The Judge said
the position of the defendant's father
was pitiful and If it were possible to
apply probationary methods in the
case he would do so. He thought the
action- of the Jury in bringing in a
verdict of jaruilty was entitled to the
highest commendation. The Jurors had
done their duty and he would not be
found wanting. He denounced the at
tempt of the defense at the trial to

CARE OF THE EYEBROWS.
NO more lucid interpretation of the present temper and imme
diate aims of the Democratic party has been given than thac
set forth by Edward M. SKepard in the current number of the
Atlantic Monthly. Here, summed up and clearly set forth, are enun
ciated the principles which are supposed to represent the platform
of Parker and Davis. After assuming the premises that the pres
ent Republican party is one in name only and expresses no continuity
of sentiment or action with the Republican spirit of the days of Lin
coln, the writer draws the conclusion that "the present political
campaign is a struggle between tendenciesâ between ideals, even
more than over specific measures' of governmental policy."
A* truer word has not been spoken; With one amendment Mr.
Shepard's dictum may be" accepted as oracle. The present com
paign represents the struggle between definite ideals" and purposes
on the part df the Republican party and the random groping after
ideals, the frantic search after definite purposes on the Democratic
side. The Democratic propaganda is a negative one. In the iter
ation and reiteration of protest lie no idealsJ The61atform cautiously
and in a spirit of compromise pieced together at St. Louis,- arid? made
to tremble under that unexpected blow from Parker's gold telegram
embodies not one ideal upon which positive issue may be made.

MILLINERY.
IN a recent number of the monthly consular reports to the De
partment of Labor and Commerce there is embodied a Russian
review of an article on "The Future and Power of the United
States" from the pen of M. Hanotaux, a prominent French economist
and member of the Academy. The spirit of the article is significant
in its bearing upon the tariff issues of the present campaign/for the
writer has sounded a. note of warning to all European manufacturing
powers who hope to compete with America under the protective
system. An "American peril," rather than the bugaboo of ; Asiatic
dominance, should keep Europeans, up o' nights, declarei^-the French
economist; protection and organization have made our. trade in
vincible. \ . t :
"On the battlefields of international trade," writes M. Hano
taux, "clever strategists have .organized a; trust vaster than any
heretofore conceived, which binds; the different States and the dif
ferent industries therein. I "refer 'to the great national trust; the tariff.
Thus at the beginning of the /twentieth century the United States
faces the world as a mos^ desirable market, on the: brie hand, and as
an awful menace '-.to; manufacturing nations on the other."
Continuing, the. writer '.shows how, within the- operation of the
protective system, the United, States has' been enabled to outbid the
coal market of free trade England in.her own ports, how American
wheat cut into the agricultural interests of France until a protective
system remedied the losses of the home grower, arid how- Germany
was compelled to fight against competition of American meats.: "
*- A stronger argument for the continued sway of protection could
not be found than that unconsciously set forth by this French writer.'
If the giant strides made byour trade Turider protection have caused
our competitors abroad to fear, for the future of their markets and to
sound the rallying cry of opposition need we makcachange?
WHERE DANGER LIES.
A pretty fashion which has been
started of late is that of wearing
cockades of colored velvet or ribbon,
one on" the left side of the corsage
rather high up, and the other on the
right side at the waist line. They are
large and are generally of a contrast
ing color to that of the gown with
which the.y are worn. Rosettes of
burnt orange velvet make an exceed
ingly pretty accompaniment to a smart
afternoon gown of brown pllsse. chiffon.

SENATOR CULBERSON of Texas is much excited by the
President's Panama policy. Speaking to a Parker meeting in
New York City, the Senator exploited his views and sought to
clinch them by reading a letter written by the President to Mr.
Shaw of the Review of Reviews, in which the President said that
he could not give countenance to the fomenting of secession in
Panama, declaring that: "Whatever other governments can do the
United States cannot go into securing by such underhand means
the canal cession." The President added that he personally would
be pleased if Panama were an independent state. Well, what good
American, at that time, would have felt differently about it? The
letter was confidential to Mr. Shaw, and at this late day the Presi
dent himself removes the seal of privacy from it, which enables
Senator Culberson to use it as a flail with which to pound threshed
straw.
Every reader of daily events on the isthmus knew that a
Panama revolution was certain after the Colombian rejection of the
Hay-Herran canal treaty. It came. It succeeded and we have
the canal cession. President Reyes of Colombia within the "last
month has admitted the right of Panama to resume her former in
dependence because of the injustice of her treatment by Colombia.
It was a Central American teapot tempest, of which President Roose
velt took entirely justifiable advantage to secure the canal that had
been the subject of dicker and bicker for a century and a half.
What would Senator Culberson have? Does he intend, if
Judge Parker is elected, to surrender the canal cession and hand
Panama back to Colombia? That is -the logical conclusion of all this
attack on the President. We will see whether New York sympa
thizes with such a plan. The canal brings the whole west coast of
Central and South America nearer to New York than the east coast
of South America. It gives thac city a new water line^access to the
trade of a great region. It does for that city in respect to the Cen
tral and South American trade what the Erie canal did for it in the
trade of our own continental center and west. The opposition is no
more sensible than was the virulent abuse of De Witt Clinton when
he projected and built the Eric canal.

ABOUT VEILS.
THE New York Times in a recent issue, in commenting on a
meeting Of citizens called for the purpose of inquiring into cer
tain acts of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, raises the question as to whether or not such private
societies are really necessary for the enforcement of the criminal
law, or whether that duty should be entirely in the hands of the
municipality.
In the October number of The Forum ? iChampe S. Andrews, an
eminent attorney of New York City, ably^fscils'sesIth'eTquery pro
pounded by the Times, and argues convincingly that private so
cieties for handling criminal and charitable matters have come to
occupy a most important position in municipalities and asserts that
the state invariably encourages and depends upon ; such bodies to
assist in a work which, strictly speaking, belongs to the govern
ment itself. â¢ $ ' . '/... '
He shows that in the city of New York there have been brought
into being, auxiliary to the regular representatives of the law, many
private societies engaged in assisting the state in performing functions
that the state itself would have to perform if the. societies did not
exist. They cover a wide field, such as employment bureaus, relief
societies, day nurseries and kindergartens, burial societies, asylums,
homes, cheap lodgings, reformatories for children, relief for the sick,
reclamation of discharged convicts, suppression of vice, '. and the
Legal Aid Society. The latter is somewhat novel in municipal affairs
and puts in motion the civil courts for the relief of the poor. It
has manifested the need for its existence by recovering to the poor
of New York over Â§1,000,000 since its incorporation in 1876.
Mr. Andrews- argues that the preservation of order, the protec
tion of property and the suppression of violence are, in practice, suf
ficient to keep any police force so busy, that the lesser criminals may
go practically undisturbed, and that it is not generally realized to
what extent the government is compelled to lean upon 'private so
cieties for the initiative in criminal and charitable matters, and that
without such bodies the burden put upon the general public, not only
in taxation but in many other ways, would be so heavy. as to be
almost unbearable. . .
A most modish trimming for taffeta
dresses is supplied â¢ by narrow velvet

PERHAPS one of the most useful of the international congresses
held at the St. Louis Exposition is that of the Military Sur
geons. It has brought to the front certain matters that sug
gest a function for army doctors that has been little considered. The
Agricultural Department has long had under investigation the sub
ject of food and diet. It has patiently collected the statistics of diet
in the several typical States of the Union~ and of the people en
gaged in the various occupations which make up the industrial and
business energies of the country. By this means we have knowledge
of the average diet of farmers, financiers, ' professional men and
workingmen. The summary shows that in each class greater health
and economy could be secured by a more scientific adjustment of the
diet and better methods of preparing food for consumption.
The world has been made familiar with dietetic reform and re
formers. Graham corrected indigestion by eating bread made from
unbolted flour, and so we had Graham bread added to our diet. But
Graham flour is no longer made. What is sold as such is merely a
mixture of fine flour and bran which the millers give us, and the
bread it makes has none of the virtues of that made from unbolted
flour. Graham's dietetic reform was derived from individual expe
rience and not from any scientific study of the subject, though his
conclusions were probably in line with science. The same has been
true of all 01 our dietetic reforms, until the subject was taken up,
systematically, by the Agricultural Department.
Its work thus far has produced little impression. Though it has
been scattered broadcast in bulletins, the people in sedentary occupa
tion go on injuring themselves by using a diet that is suitable for out
door and active workers, and these impair their health by consuming
the more costly food which is suitable for the sedentary. Now an
army surgeon, -Major Seaman, at the International Congress, brings
the subject sharply to the attention of the country. The army sur
geon has been looked upon as a professional person who cuts off legs
and arms that ought to be left on, and whose duties are confined to
the operating table of a field hospital. Major Seaman shows him in
a different light and gives the credit where it belongs, to the Japa
nese in the present war.
The Japanese Government took the results of scientific study and
practically applied them to the army ration. In that way a ration
was devised that sustains the health, strength and endurance of the
Japanese army. Operating in a country that has been time and
again swept by choleraic and other forms of intestinal disease, the
Japanese soldiers have been entirely free from those maladies and
have shown the most remarkable endurance and staying power ever
possessed by a great army.
Major Seaman very naturally resents the failure of this and the
Governments of the other Western nations to detail army surgeons
and commissaries to attend the Japanese armies and study this part
of their military policy. In all wars heretofore intestinal diseases
have slain more men than have fallen in battle or died from wounds.
The Japanese are saving themselves this vast loss of military strength
by attention to the army ration, and the Western nations cannot be
indifferent to this part of military science.
Aside from its importance as a military policy Japan is also
teaching the world a most impressive lesson in dietetics. The diet
that sustains a soldier in hard marches and the rigors of battle and
that keeps him in such health that he quickly recovers from wounds
that are uniformly fatal to soldiers who are unscientifically fed
should be studied by the whole world as a means of preserving the
public health and furnishing strength to those who are enduring the
labors of peace. If such a diet increase the laboring capacity and
industrial output of the world and prevent the loss of time and money
caused by frequent illness, it will be seen that the most important
economic results will be accomplished.
One of the most important advances made by our Spanish war
is the discovery of our army surgeons in. the demonstration of the
spread of febrile diseases by mosquitoes. If we add to this the
progress made in dieting by Japan the world will have received sub
stantial additions to health and longevity as the contribution of the
science of killing to the art preservative of life.
That little girl who was brought into
notoriety with a death charged to her
account is a terrible warning against
the so-called "freedom" of the Ameri
can girl that has been the talk ((and
not altogether favorable talk) of every
country, aays a writer In the Phila
delphia North American.
Out' with another girl of her own age.
at one of the amusement parks, with
no check on her pert forms of amus
ing herself, she swung on the power of
the trolley that was Just ready to start
and ran the car over the motorman

In the face of eye-witnesses, before
court, with j its lawyers and Judges,
and its hundreds of accusing eyes, be
fore the very consciousness of the
crowd that would break a woman or a
man down, to say nothing of a child,
she becomes defiant.
Women everywhere are wondering
at it. The very shock, itself, of being
present at so sudden a death, should
have shaken her composure. Her
father, realizing the enormity of the
deed and her apparent callousness,
broke completely down, and left the
courtroom sobbing, while his defiant
little child was led awayâ dry-eyed â
to await the decision of the court.
The whole story is terrible. But
what has made it possible? Isn't it
time something frightful like this very
accident should occur to make people
realize that the wonderful freedom our
girls have been reveling in is becoming
unlicensed? * %V>"
Webster, or some one of our glorious
patriots, says that "there can be no
true liberty where there is no obe
dience to just laws." Surely some
sort of discipline ought to-be main
tained over children!

ing one of the evils we women must
work to destroy.
Give a child a taste of the unnatural
life and her appetite becomes perverted.
Instead of romping and playing in an
innocent way, she requires something
to be going on every moment, until, at
the best, she becomes a hollow, Incap
able, hardened woman, and at the
worst-â! .
The eld idea of shielding a woman
from care and knowledge of the world
was perhaps too binding in its restric
tions, but it kept young girls safe â
kept them in a state of wholesome In
nocence and sweetness.
That life couldn't exist now. With
girls pushing to the front in every way
â in business, In sports, in the thou
sand and one ways that were debarred
in olden times, there must be more
freedom.
But surely it v need not extend to
children. Girls of 11 or 12 are no fit
judges of their own actions and need
a certain amount of restraint or dis
cipline. ' - â¢
Keep your' girls close to you â you
mothers who. hail their going out with
so much reliefâ keep your girls close,
and don't let them be added to the list
of terrible sacrifices to the spirit of
unlicensed freedom!

SHORT-TERM MARRIAGES ARE HER DISCUSSED BY MR. DOOLEY
WHO DOES NOT APPROVE OF THE MEREDITH IDEA
be mentioned â preparation. Here we
have something all Important. The
very first steps along the royal road
should be steps of preparation. ..Our
preparation for any given work nat
urally suggests to us the necessity for
some natural ability, the more the bet
ter. Success for the mentally Incompe
tent is out of the question, but with a
fair degree of natural mental ability
the work of gaining the acquired abil
ity should and must be diligently pur
sued. Some years ago the writer spoko
to a young man regarding his prepar
ing himself for a certain profession for
which he had considerable ability, and
for which he confessed he bad no tittle
liking, but he as frankly confessed two
things: it took too Ions to prepare
one's self for such a work, and, sec
ondly, one had to know so much that
he did not wish to undertake so diffi
cult a task. That same young man is
still sitting around the stores of that
little village waiting for success to
come to him In some easy way. The
golden crown of success awaits the
brow of him who is willing. to strive for
it. The royal road which leads ever la
that direction Is the road of wise selec
tion, honest desire, unflinching deter
mination, hard work and adequate
ability. He who will choose and faith
fully apply these principles will attain
unto the coveted prize of this Ufa â
success.
ping stone upon which we shall mount
nearer and nearer our goal â success.
It is an indication of royal blood to
behold the young man with head up,
eyes flashing,* shoulders thrown back
and, like the eagle, his gaze ever set on
the sun of success. The final analysis In
the majority of failures will reveal the
fact â lack of application, afraid of hard
workâ has been the cause. "Work or
starve" is nature's motto â "it is writ
ten on the stars and the like â starve
mentally, starve morally, starve phys
ically." There is no success In God'a
universe for the idler. Hard work Is
the price we pay, diligent application
is the price we pay. But he who will
thus apply himself will get full re
turns, measure for measure heaped up,
pressed down, 'running over. "There
is but one method of attaining excel
lence," said. Sydney Smith, "and that Is
hard labor." The mottoes of great men
reveal the secret of their success. Here
area few: "Voltaire's motto was "Tou
jours au Travail" (always at work).
Scott's was "Never be doing nothing."
Work! work! work! has been the motto
of hundreds of men who have left the
blessed heritage of success to all com
ing generations. Daniel Webster said,
"I have worked for more than twelve
hours a day for fifty years." Do not
be afraid of work, young man, if you
would obtain success.
I have reserved for the last thing to
The road to success Is full of diffi
culties. Many are the discourage
ments, much need will you have for
all your powers of determination. Our
faces must ever be set toward the
goal. . "Our greatest glory," said
Goldsmith, "Is not in never falling,
but in rising every time we fall." Hav
ing once put our hands to the plow
we ; shall not look back. : Every dif
ficult problem, every rough â¢ place,
every hard knot along this way should
be mastered and so thoroughly mas
tered that each would become a step-

package and place It in 'their hands
gladly enough would they receive it.
Remember, though, .my young friend,'
success comes not after that manner.
If that good thing 'you would obtain
there must be an honest desire. It is
an old but none the less true saying
where there Is a will there is a way.
An honest desire sees and seizes the
opportunity, where others less earnest
allow them to pass by all unnoticed.
"I can't; it is impossible," said a
foiled lieutenant to Alexander. "Be
gone," shouted the conquering Mace
donian. "There Is nothing Impossible
to him who will try."
As another requisite to genuine suc
cess I mention Invincible grit. Bonar
sings well and truly:
genuine success which we are seeking,
or is it a mere gauzy delusion with
which we. are willing to be wound
about and made to believe that we had
attained something real? If it is the
real you are looking for, I believe I
can help you; If It is the other, away,
away, I will have nothing to do with It.
There are some things, as essential
to genuine success as fresh air, pure
water, plenty of exercise and well
cooked food are to a healthy body.
They are what we are pleased to call
the milestones along the royal road
which leads to success. Our starting
point we will call the City of Selection.
In which particular field of this great
world's activities are we looking to for
success? Artemus Ward said:
"Every man has got a Forte. What
each man's particular Forte is he
wants to find out. The sooner the bet
ter. Foolish Is the man who starts on
a Journey not knowing whither, nor
caring where, the road may lead. What
ever you are by nature, keep to it;
never desert your line of talent. Be
what nature intended you for, and you
will succeed. Be anything else, and
you will be ten thousand times worse
than nothing." The theory that the
son be what the father has been, and
do what the father has done, has been
the means of scattering along the high
way the bleached carcasses of failure,
while if the child had been permitted

D It is possible for every young

yet, there is nothing so rare as
genuine success. * I desire to have
the ears of the boys and young

the young men of our city to-day have
the widest open door leading into the
great halls of success that are to be

who has it in him need not seek other
and greener fields from which to reap
his harvests of success. Right at your
very doors the fields are white already
unto the harvest.
Let us for a moment look at the
eubject, which indicates the lines
along which we wish to direct this
talk, "The Royal Road to Success."

leads to true success; Royal, because
the best blood, the purest and noblest

tion Â« by. saying: "In . the absence of

to our schools were they dropped with

> P. W. Kauffman, Superintendent of
Pomona Schools, contributes . his
ion by saying: \"My. observation in
Southern Â¦'California y foH fifteen 'years
leads me to believe that teachers' lnstl-
maintained since then by the teachers.
Such instruction is of vital worth.
Professor Brown offers as suggestions
for the general improvement of, insti
tutes that some of the lectures be
based cm carefully directed studies of
the teachers during the preceding year;
and, that a portion of the institute time
be given to discussion '. by. the teachers
of real oroblems In school work. He
emphasizes the urgent need of the-em
ployment of a deputy county superin
tendent in the larger counties to visit
the schools continually for the special
purpose of the Improvement of teaching
along the newer "or more difficult lines
of instruction. By such helps the coun
try teacher realizes some of the advan
tages which are constantly enjoyed) by
the' city teacher in- conferences w^ith
the supervisors .of special subjects.
Still further, Professor Brown deems
it possible that university extension
may be so directed as to co-operate
effectively with the institutes. He also
thinks that the experiment' should be
tried of securing in agricultural coun
ties such effective co-operation between
teachers* institutes and farmers' insti :
-tutes that the work of the schools and
the farmers should come into more in
timate ; relations: -;â¢â¢-.
C. N. Shane, Superintendent of Placer
County, reports his views on this ques-
sen ted to the teachers of various
grades^ new subjects or new Â¦ methods
of I presenting them â¢ might be given to
the' teachers of the county as a varia
tion from the present method and be
satisfactory, 'but I would not ' advocate
a vpermanlent' change from the present
plan."'"
,, â¢ Hugh J*. : Baldwin, Superintendent of
San* Diego County, states that, "The
economic and educational value of the
annual county institutes has been a
source of considerable discussion in the
county, institutes of the State and â¢Â¦ in
the annual gatherings of the' Calif ornia
Teachers' , Association. In each place
strong arguments are presented both
for. and against, usually ending the de
bated by referring the matter to a com
mittee that never reports.
"In analyzing the school system of
this State and { on tracing the sources
that >have evolved : our excellent edu
cational institutions, one can; readily
discover, the great mission that" the
county^ Institute has filled. It /has
assisted in developing many of the
strong - features ; of the system and a
professional spirit seldom met with
outside : of California. This evolution
hag;caused jus to outgrow Jt. The;gar
ment no longer fits. The; teachers ;as
a body are Â¦ hungry for /educational . food
arid the county, institute does r not r satls
factorilyj supply ' it. â¢ The personnel \ of
"County Boards of Education are rep
resentative bodies, already vested with
large discretionary powers, and should
be duly authorized to make such, ex
emptions. The summer normal at San
Jose has been a signal success and oth
ers should be established. In the. near
future let a permanent normal be or
ganized at Fresno, or some other point,
for the benefit t>f that great area now
destitute of normal facilities. The an
nual saving of the State's money -by
suspending the institutes held in the
San .Joaquin Valley, will 'alone 'provide
for a large part of its support. It. will
be said that this plan of exemption in
volves a radical change. ; Be ., it: Â«o.' I
hope that a better plan may be found."
Doubtless, for some time to come lome
of the counties, especially the mountain
counties, will need the peculiar advan
tages which Institutes bestow. ThlÂ«
fact, however, should not militate
against a change being made by those
counties which .demand it I propose
that the school law be so amended as
to allow the exercise of the principle
of local option. Let the amendment
provide that any county shall be ex
empted from holding Institutes when
Its Board of Education shall prescribe
attendance by all of the regular teach
ers of that county for four or six
weeks, once in two years, at a summer
normal . or university school. Said at

the teaching force of this State is too
weir prepared for the old regime con
templated by the law now on the'stat
ute ; books. The State teachers' associ
ations and the summer schools under
the management of the universities
furnish mental equipment for our
teachers far beyond the possibility of
the county institutes of the day." The
county Institutes have well filled the
pioneering in the evolution of ' the
school system of the State. Now we
want something greater and higher."
A correspondent who wishes his name
to be withheld Â¦ writes that he is : one
of those who believe that : teachers* in

benefit . to ; the school interests of Cali

The United States training ship
Buffalo, formerly the El Cid and lat
er the Brazilian dynamite cruiser
Xictheroy, is on her way to this port
from Honolulu. She has a large num
ber of trained landsmen which will
be transferred to the battleship Ohio,
completing that vessel's complement
of crew. It was the intention of the
Navy Department at one time to send
the Buffalo to the Atlantic for new
boilers, of which she is much in need,
but the orders for that long Journey
have been changed. The department
â¢was not sure tii vessel could make
that distance in her present condition,
so the boilers will be built at Mare
Island navy yard and the vessel kept
on this coast as a recruit schoolship
for the Pacific fleet. The boilers wiiS
cost more than % 120,000, all of the
â¢work being done by the Mare Island
mechanics and the material being sent
to this coast from the East.

every fruit grower in California is di

their labors. Failing in this, ruin

The British ship Andreta, another
overdue, arrived at Falmouth, Eng
land, from Sydney, Australia. She -wag
out 171 days â a trip that is usually
made in from 100 to 120 days. Her
rates of reinsurance arose from 10 to
LO per cent, eo sure were the specu
lators that she had foundered some
where on the ocean. Her appearance
yesterday at Falmouth, even after her
owners had lost all hopes of her safety,
was a surprise to them and a disap
pointments to others who played on
her possible destruction.
The Andreta sailed from Sydney
January 20 and ten days later encoun
tered a gale that almost finished her.
The vessel was thrown on her beam
ends and lay with the starboard rail
under water for twenty-four hours. To
right the ship the captain cut away
the fore topmast which falling over
board carried the main topmast with
it. In her half-wrecked condition the
vessel put back to Sydney. The fore
mast, which was found to have been
sprung in the storm, was taken out
and repaired. The Andreta sailed again
April 10 and going round the Horn
struck another spell of bad weather.
In her weakened state but little sail
could be carried. She finally worried
out of the belt of storms and under
thoit canvas literally crawled to her
home port.
The German ship Sirene is yet out
with an increased reinsurance of S5
per cent. She is 145 days from Liver
pool to Valparaiso.
Two of the lonff overdue ships have
arrived at their ports of destination
and thoÂ»e who played them not to ar
rive have lost. The Rosalia d'Ali,
Â¦which has been out for the unusually
long period of 157 days from New
Caledonia to Delaware Breakwater,
suddenly appeared in port. Calms,
head winds and other unfavorable
Tieather delayed her. The reinsurance
was 6 per cent.

A committee of fireman pensioners
called on Mayor Schmltz yesterday
and asked him to aid them in getting
their pensions for June, which have
not been paid owing to a deficit in the
fund. The Mayor called attention to
a letter from the Fire Commissioners
to the effect that the deficit is due to
the failure of the Board of Supervis

requiring the board named to make
a sufficient annual appropriation to
pay the pensions. The Mayor prom
ised to take the matter up with the
Finance Committee to the end that
means be provided to make up the
deficit.

demand for local real estate. The

business is excellent and that the out
look for the immediate future is
bright. A hopeful spirit pervades the
community. The growth of the city
and of the suburbs furnished new
proof of the popularity of the bay re
gion. San Francisco, because it is the
business center of the State and be
cause, not less, it is the center of
many attractions that no smaller com
munity can maintain, naturally leads
the way in advancement. ' Notwith

Eerkeley and of Oakland and the re
awakening of Alameda, this city still
finds itself without sufficient accom
modations for its steadily growing
population. Two hundred and twelve
buildings were contracted for with
builders last month, the improvements
representing in total $1,558,241. Sep
tember, 1903, only ninety-flve build

It also appears likely that the re
jr.arkably large increase last week was
due to the unrecorded movements of
money hitherto from the interior or the
absence of withdrawals of funds by in
stitutions in neighboring 'cities because
of the opportunities offered patrons of
these banks for in -the
booming stock market Deposits were
increased last week by $6,559,000, as the
result of ' which the required reserve
was augmented 11.625,750; deducting
this sum from the gain of $3,535,800
cash as above, left 51,836.050 as the in
crease In surplus reserves to $17,853,925,
against $17,944,450 ai year ago. Com
puted upon the basis of deposits less
those of $23,222,200 public funds, i the
surplus is $23.â¬S4.475. Loans were ex
panded .- $3,917,000, probably reflecting
borrowing incident to the stock specu
lation. The statement made a bad
proof, the sum of the increase in loans
and of the gain in cash being $833,800
greater than the increase in deposits. : "
NEW YORK, Oct. 22.â TheÂ» Financier
cays: The feature of the official state
ment of the New York Associated
Banks last week was the remarkable
discrepancy between the cash move
ment as reported in the statement and
that which was estimated upon the
basis of the traceable changes in this
Item during the week, the official re
turn showing a gain of $3,525,600 while
the estimates indicated a loss of $239,
209. Inasmuch as in the previous week
there was Quite as remarkable discrep
ancy between the officially reported
and the estimated movement of cash,
the former ehowing a gain of $311,400,
â¢while the latter recorded an increase of
$5,275,000â It seems probable . that the
discrepancy last week was due to the
adjustment of averages in the cash
Item, a large part of the gain in the
previous week, as shown by the esti
mates, being brought "over into last

"At this ,' point ' in " our history the
tariff question ceased temporarily to be
an 'issue in~ American" politics. ; It dis
appeared bo completely : that .when the
Republican 'party ,-was formed ho one
thought'- of reviving : it and there is
good; reason- for- believing that , it never
would have, been ' revived but ' for the
Civil War, which necessitated the rais-^
ing. of a . large revenue*, to ! meet the ex

ury. Certain classes availed ' themselves
of .this, opportunity to -seintroduce the

â¢ "'It must be .remembered that the
present duties", taken together, are far
in excess of what they were before the
war and they have been three' times
largely increased since the passage of
the Morrill tariff act of 1861. If j the
present rates of duty .were high enough
during and" since the war, when home
industry was burdened with heavy in

" cfVBD WAR REVENUES.
"The war of 1812 and the. embargo
acts which accompanied it stopped im
portation for the time being, having
the effect of 'a prohibitory tariffi - When
the war came to an end and the pro
tected classes were again subjected to
the competition which they had : before
successfully met, they demanded more
protection arid they got it. The; tariff
was advanced to 24 1-2 per cent aver
age and then by leaps and bounds until
1827. when it reached 43 per cent. The
latter has passed into history as, the
"History of Abominations." It was
followed by Clay's compromise tariff
of 1833, which reduced duties by a slid
ing scale, extending over a number of
years, to 20 per cent.
Mr. Clay was at that era. and, indeed,
during his whole public life, the: stand
ard bearer of the 'American systejn' of
tariff protection^ and I 'wish to recall
some words that he tlsed in a 7 debate
In the Senate in 1838, justifying his
course in advocating thfs tariff reduc
tion. He said: - - '
r 'No one, Mr. President, in the com
mencement of the protective policy,
ever supposed that it was to be per
petual. "We hoped and believed that
temporary protection extended to : our
infant manufactures would bring them
up and enable them to withstand com
petition with those of Europe. , If the
protective policy were entirely to cease
in 1842 it would have existed twenty
six years from 1816, or -eighteen from
1824, quite as long as at either of these
periods its friends 1 supposed might be
necessary.* v ,
"Mr. Clay here voiced. the prevailing
opinion of the country that the pro
tected trades were no longer in a state
of infancy. In fact, the infant indus
try argument was' then superseded by
the pauper labor argument. It was
now contended for the first time that
the tariff should bjÂ» used to compensate
the American producer for the higher
wages that he had to pay, as compared
with his foreign competitors. . As this
argument has at times done great ser
vice, although now quite threadbare, I
will dwell upon it a moment.
"Inasmuch as the law puts 'the tariff
benefits exclusively in the hands of the
capitalist and provides no means for
giving the wage-worker his share, the
system virtually says:
"' 'Let the ; Government take care; of
the rich and the rich will-take care of
the poor."
"It is a short step then to say: 'LÂ»et
dependent of. foreign nations for mili
tary and. other â¢supplies.',
Does anybody . say ; that have : not'
reached that | condition?" Does any
body contend "that the "United "States
is still dependent on ..foreign* nations
for military and other essential sup
plies?'- Have we not frequently, heard
the note -of alarm 'in Europe at the
American invasion of the^world's mar
kets by/our:. manufactured goods' and
especially those' of ; iron .and steel?
"In this rep<5rt Hamilton
a number of- manufacturing industries
as already established in 'Â¦'- the United
States' in his time. Among Hhese were
leather, -Iron and eke!,- copper- and
brass, tiles and pottery, wood," paper,
hats, carriages of all' kinds, and 'most
articles of personal clothing, and house
hold use. These, he says, 'have j grown
â¢up and flourished with.a rapidity. whiph
surprises, affording: an encouraging as
surance of success* â meaning success^ in
other branches^ of 'manufactures." "if
these branches had grown , up 'and
flourished with surprising rapidity 113
years affo, what just claim of'extrava
gant government bounties can they ad
vance now? * ; r - ... - .->â¢ "â¢
"Although Hamilton is - - usually
cited as the founder of 'the system, it
really began before ' him>- The first
tariff bill wis passed in' 1789. As or
iginaKy reported,' it was a tariff for
revenue only. Mr. Madison, who .re
ported Jt to the house, was > opposed to
protection on" principle, but "he yielded
in some particulars to the advocates of
that doctrine, so that his bilj became a
tariff for revenue! with some slight In
cidental protection; the average rate of
duty being eight and one-half per cent,
ad valorem* All of our tariff? until 1816
Â¦were of this sort and the \ argument
used to support the 'very^moderale pro
tective, features was substantially >the
same as that of Hamilton already
mentioned. * It was coupled also with
the argument, on which. Hamilton. had
laid great stress, that the competition
of domestic manufacturers-would.'-re
duce the" prices of goods, and % prevent
anything like monopoly. He did not
foresee the combinations of the present
day, organized to do away 'with com

THE VALUE OF CHARGOAL
Few People Know How Useful It Is in Pre-
stTYing Health and Beauty.
.Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal Is the safest. and roost efficient
disinfectant and purifier In nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; it Is not a
drug at all, but elraply absorbs the
gases and Impurities always present
In the Etomach and Intestines and car-
ries them out of the system. V
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
tjnoking, drinking or after eating:
cnions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and lm-"
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth* and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
! It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal ""in one
form or anotfier. but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money is
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal, and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
tbe form of large, pleasant tasting lor-
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
coon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use, but, on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas In stomach
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
Jon and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, ar.d although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal In Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

The rule of conduct In runaways, long

horsemen, is evidently one that railway
travelers would do well to bear in mind.
The â¢'.vay of safety in danger of any
kind Is to keep cool and do nothing un
til sure that what may be done will
not increase rather than " lessen the
danger. Hasty action Is not the same
es prompt action, and fear is the worst
possible gufde in danger. To cultivate
the power of repressing fear and thus
leave the judgment unclouded should
bÂ« the constant study of every one. Be
cause it strengthens that power and
helps to correct action Is the reason

ST. LOUIS, Oct. : 2 2.â Believing
himself about to die! William Morris,
alias Blair, the leader of the' three 1
suspects who killed Detectives .Shea
and Dwyer in yesterday's desperate
battle and who was himself wounded
in two vital organs, to-day confessed
to having been implicated in two; train
robberies, after his identification- by
railroad men as one of the four men
who robbed the Pullman passengers
on the Illinois Central "diamond spe
cial" between Harvey and Madison,
111., August 1.
The identification x was made by
Lawrence B. Combs, conductor of the
train which was robbed; W. E. Shep
herd, the baggage man, and William
H. Burch, flagman at Madison. As
soon as Combs saw Morris he said:
"The last time I saw you you had a
gun a foot and a half lonsr."
Morris smiled. "Yes, and I've got It
yet," he said. . (
"You were the big fellow in the
lead," said Combs.
;"Tes," said Morris. "I'm going to
die and I might as well tell the whole
thing. I held up a special World's
Fair train at Columbus Junction,
Iowa, the latter part of July. We got

coast of Mexico, like Mazatlan, Ensen
ada, Guaymas, San Bias and Acapulco.
But, better than all other 'reasons, we
believe In the republic of Mexico; we
rejoice in its achievements in self-gov
ernment, and our people Join the Mex
ican citizens annually on the loth of
September in celebrating Mexico's na
tional anniversary, and in paying a
tribute of respect to the memory of
Don Miguel Hidalgo y Castillo, who in
1810 struck the first blow for the lib
erty of Mexico against the oppression
of Spain.
The evening ended with an address
by Admiral B. H. McCalla, who re
sponded to "The Navy." and was
heartily applauded.
Colonel Joselyn responded to "The
Army" in place of Major General Mac-
Arthur. A fine reception was given
General Torres when he rose to re
spond to Colonel Joselyn. He re
ferred generally to the advancement
and development of the Mexican army
and its patterning on American prin
ciples. He ended with the. hope that
the armies of Mexico and the United
States might ever continue in the
friendly relations that exist at present.
At the conclusion of his speech three
hearty cheers were given General
Torres.
"The able statesmen of Mexico (and
among them are" our. honored guests)
have, with President ' Diaz, inculcated
a spirit of patriotism among the young
men of their republic, and the love of
country has become an inspiration to
those who will, in God's own time,
take the places of those who now con
trol the Government. This means the
prosperity and happiness of the people
and the perpetuity of the republic of
Mexico. In the development of your
varied and inexhaustible resources, in
the prosrress, advancement and attain
ment of your people, in all that exalts
a nation, the -United States extends
the right hand, of fellowship and be
stows upon your country our benedic
tion."

a woman has been told that to
save ber life it will be necessary for her
to undergo a dangerous surgical opera-
tion, especially â¢when two well-known
nospital doctors agree that an operation
la the only helpâ to be quickly, thorough-
ly and painlessly cured at a trifling ex-
pense, such a woman must surely be
grateful. Well, the Electro-Chemic
treatment has cured me after I had suf-
fered untold misery for seven years and
after two of the best family physicians
in San Francisco had told me that the
only thing that would save my life
would be a surgical operation. I am
happy and grateful to the Electro-
Chemic specialists for my cure, and I
want every suffering woman to know ot
this wonderful new treatment â so pain-
less â so pleasant â so quick in its effects
and bo cheap. My case was one of those
distressing ovarian troubles. Tumors had
all formed and the pains in the lower ab-
domen were awfuL The pains and weak-
ness in my back at times were almost
unbearable. I was dizzy. I could not
*at. I was sick at my stomach and at
times could not sleep. My picture at the
top of this article Is quite good. My
name Is Mrs. E. W. Suttle and I live at
2Co. 3 82 Perry street, San Francisco. Any
one interested In my wonderful cure is
at liberty to call on me for further par- '
ticulars.
If Electro-Chemistry had accomplished
nothing else but the cure of suffering
women, keeping them off of the operating
table, it would take a first place amongst
the greatest of modern discoveries as a
curative agent, but Electro-Chemistry is
the most successful treatment now in
use for the cure of Consumption. Ca-
tarrh, Asthma, Bronchitis. Rheumatism.
Neuralgia. Locomotor Ataxia, Falling
Bickness. Epilepsy, Dizziness, Headaches,
Spots before the Eyes. Piles. Fissure,
Fistula, Stricture. Prostatitis. Varico-
ccle. Nerve Exhaustion. Cancers, Tu-
mors, Old Sores and Abscesses. Weak
Heart. Palpitation. Shortness of Breath.
Insomnia, Blood Poison, Skin Diseases.
Eczema. Goitre. Swollen Joints. "Weak
Back. Kidney Diseases. Bladder Diseases,
Bright's Diseasa, Diabetes, etc.. etc.
The Electro-Chemic examination is the
most reliable examination that any suf-
ferer can have. Such an examination
will quickly show whether a case is cura-
ble or not, and this examination is now
absolutely free to any sufferer applying
at the Institute for it. The Electro-
Chemic Institute occupies nearly the
whole first floor of the large building at
118 Grant avenue, corner of Post street.
The oflice hours are from nine to five
and from seven to eight, daily, and from
ten to one on R.undayp. There are re-
tired and private apartments set aside
for the male and female patients. The
KlÂ«>ctro-Cliemic Institute is the only in-
stitution on the Pacific Coast doing this
work. The office is centrally located at
31S Grant avenue, and persons desiring
to consult the Electro-Chemic specialists
will do well to make no mistake regard-
ing the place.
Tnr fClertm-CheTnic home treatment is
very pupoossful and patients who are
Ekk and who live at a distance should
try to come for personal examination
when possible. When this can not t>e ,
done, a short description of principal
symptoms should be sent In and full in-
struction* regarding examination and a
home course of the treatment will be ',
promptly forwarded, free of charge.

John Fitzgerald Murphy, playwright,
told Judge Mogan that his assault upon
Landlord Reavis of the Hotel Meredith
was committed in self-defense,, as he
delivered the kick when he was pinned
to the bed by the assailed one and two
other men who had entered his apart
ments without invitation. Mrs.
Murphy, with whom the defendant was
quarreling, told the court that she did
not desire to testify, | and she was ex
cused. Mr. Reavis said he had retired
for the night when the woman's de
spairing shriek, 'Kill me quick and
have done with it," Impelled him to go
to her rescue. He did not Invade the
room, but was dragged into it, despite
his semi-dressed condition, by Murphy.
The two men who aided the landlord in
holding down the dramatist until the
police arrived also adduced some unin
teresting testimony. Murphy then
stated that he has left the Hotel Mere
dith and will remove his trunks next
Monday, and the case was continued
till Tuesday in. order to see if he keeps
his word. Mrs. Murphy displayed
much indignation while her husband
was testifying.
Koenlng lives at 59 Prospect avenue
with his second wife, and at No. 65 on
the same thoroughfare dwells the wom
an from whom he was divorced several
years ago. When the family was
divided Bertha accompanied her
mother, who was left in comparative
poverty. Several months ago the at
tention of Mrs. John Pettee, manager
of the Universal Service Society, was
called to the fact that the girl was not
being properly cared for and investiga
tion disclosed the fact that the sooner
she became the wife of one William
Hansen, an amateur lightweight pugi
list, the better chance would she have
of saving her honor. So the wedding
w6s effected by having Hansen arrest
ed for vagrancy and arraigned before
Judge Mogan, who gave him the alter
native Of marrying the girl or spending
six months in the County Jail. A few
days Inter the bridegroom disappeared,
and since then the young wife has been
working as a domestic. Now her ap
proaching maternity makes it impos
sible for her to toil. Mrs. Pettee was
again appealed' to, and she haled the
father into court to ascertain if the law
could not force him to do what paternal
feeling is naturally supposed to prompt.
The law was powerless in the matter,
because of the young woman's wife
hood. And the father openly exulted
in his immunity from compulsion to
perform a fatherly act His wife/too,
made no secret of her satisfaction over
the Judge's ruling.
Until her trying period is over the
young woman will be cared for by the
Universal Service Society.
Police Judge Cabaniss expressed re
gret that the law did not make it com
pulsory on John Koening.Vivory turner,
to contribute to the maintenance of his
16-year-old daughter, Bertha, until she
is able " to provide" for herself and the
babe that Is soon to demand her ma
ternal care. The father was seemingly
gratified to find that he could not be
legally forced to aid the child, and
angrily rejected the court's suggestion
that he donate $25 to her. She was a
married woman, he said, and It was not
his fault that her husband had deserted
her. Besides, she had been impudent
to him and her stepmother. Not one
cent would she ever receive from him.
Of course she was his flesh and blood,
and it was true that he owned prop
erty and could afford to give away
more than $25; but were those any
reasons why he should reward her dis
obedience with kindness? No, sir.

meant by such conduct he deflantly
answered that he would do the same
thing over, again if ho felt like doing
It.
"You must want to go to Jail,"

They are the natural antidote for |
liver and kidney troubles and cure con- i
stipation and purify the blood in. a way I
that often surprises patient and physi-
cian jallke.. â .
Dr. R. M. Wllkihs while experiment-
ing with sulphur remedies soon' found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from consti-
pation or malaria. < I Â¦ have been sur-
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium "Wafers. In'patients
suffering from brtls and pimples , and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re-
peatedly seen them dry up and disap-
pear, in four or five days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie-
tary article and sold by druggists, and
for that reason tabooed by many nhy-
siclans, yet I km>w\of nothing so safe
and reliable.fqr constipation, Hver and
kidney^ troubles^arid -especially iri all
forms of skin disease aa this remedy "
At any rate people who are tired ot
pills, â¢ cathartics and so-called blood
/^purifiers," will find in Stuart's Cal-
cium .Wafers , a' far. safer, , more - pala-
table and effective preparation.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and molas-
ses every spring and fall, but the cru-
dity and impurity of ordinary flowers of
sulphur were often worse than the dls- j
ease, and cannot compare with the I
modern concentrated preparations of }
sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium I
Wafers are undoubtedly the best and j
most widely used. : I
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health:
sulphur acts directly on the liver and
excretory organs, and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elimin-
ation of waste material.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a single grain
Is far more effective than a tablespoon-
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
in drug stores under the name of
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. They are
small chocolate coated pellets and con-
tain the active medicinal principle of
FUlphur in a highly concentrated, ef-
fective form.
The mention of sulphur will recall to J
many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us
our daily dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall. i
It was the universal spring and fall I
"blood purifier," tonic and . cure-all, '
and mind you, this old-fashioned rem-
edy was not without merit.
The Idea was good but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect. !

Tree's revival of "The Tempest" ought
to have a page to Itself in the perma
nent* annals of the stage of; our ; time.
The reason this Shakespeare fantasy
has been given so rarely in the pres
ent generation is doubtless that its hu
man and drama tic interest Is so thin,
and that the expenditure required for
enough scenic interest '.to supply the
deficiency has been appalling. -But
whether or not one considers Tree a
great 'all-round actor, no one' can deny,
his zeal, taste and lavishness as a % pro
ducer of plays. Thus it is thatt'The
Tempest" now fills the big stage, of
Hi* Majesty's Theater with scenes the

Gorgeous opal sunsets, groves of deli

shipwreck beyond precedent for 'the

with open hand by Air. Tree. to. this
collaboration of his with Shakespeare.
Probably no such adequate shipwreck
v-as ever put on' the stage before. The
ship, rolling and tossing madly in flt
fnl gleams of lightning, filled the
whole front of the stage, instead of be
ing represented at a distance that
would .permit details . to be slighted.
There ' was such a terrific roar .v of
storm that all; the- dialogue -was lost;
I but doubtless , Shakespeare, himself a
j keen manager, would have forgiven
'this loss for the sake of gain in scenic
effect. \> . ' * ;

. Tree "chose^ for himself the part "of
Caliban, and of a ' certainty/ out- t
monf tered dll other Calibans of stage
history. _- t His horrid, "-: hairy* ; sllmlness

dignity made such I sacrifice : for real
ism. When Trinculo, the : jester, com
plained of the stench of the .monster,
one could almost. fancy that the cause
of complaint was apparent to the au
dience, too.
The other notable feature of the per
formance was ; the , /appearance -: of
Tree's "attractive young daughter sViola
as Ariel. Nothing' was ' left .undone
for, her in the 'way of providing her
with' the center , of the stage, '-with
limelights and with elaborate settings,
and the? general verdict seems 'to be
that she acquitted' herself V; gracef iilly,

EIGHTY THOUSAND FALL.
German Officer Writes Satirical Novel
Which Hurts the Feelings of the s
Fusilier Guards.
BERLIN, Oct 22. â Count Wolfston
Baudissin, a kinsman of Rear Ad
miral von Baudissin, commander of
the imperial yacht Hohenzollern dur
ing the visit of Prince Henry of Prus
sia to the United States, is on trial in
the Criminal Court here for libeling
the officers' corps- of the Fusilier
Guard Regiment, "belonging to the
household troops, by satirizing them
in a novel entitled "First Class Men."
The prosecution is brought by the
state on, the ground of public welfare.
Von Baudissin, whose pen name is
Baron von Schlicht, is a retired army
lieutenant, a playwright and the au
thor of about twenty books on mili
tary subjects or romances of military
life.
Shakhe Station, five miles : north, the
report; that the ' Russians ; had :bom
barded the station applying to the
bridge, as the station is now beyond
the sphere of their operations. '
\ The : haavy ' concentration of .. both
Russians between, the Mandarin and
the railroad makes i certain Â¦ a , tremen
dous collision* at this, point.- A portion
of the Eighth Army Corps, which had
reached Harbin,' is; hurrying south
ward. V
While the Japanese evidently are
determined to pursue - the policy fol
lowed by them since the beginning of
the war of concealing ; the extent of
their losses the War Office believes*
that their casualties . must ' be at least
three-fourths as great as those of,' the
Russians- â probably ' in * the neighbor
hood of 30,000. / ~ ',;
, The weather has again become clear,
but.it is. very cold, and the soldiers
.are reported to be"* suffering. A cor
respondent wires that v two Japanese
were found Friday: night by a detach
ment of Cossacks. ", They, were uncon-.
scious and : half 'â¢ frozen and . conveyed
to the Russian camp, where they were
cared for. ,. V. ' . ,Â¦
came into the Russian lines and volun
tarily surrendered.
- Field Marshal . Oyama's ' counter of
fensive was checked with
the loss of men, guns and munitions.
General Kuropatkin's army extends
along a line" running over, twelve and
a half : miles 'south of Mukden and is
supported by strong fortifications on
the Hurf River. The present calm is
enforced by the exhaustion of the ar
mies on both sidea, which lost in
killed and' wounded 80,000 men during
the ten days', fighting. â¢Â¦ * .
j There is every indication that the
battle will be resumed soon and that
a decisive result ! will be achieved. â¢
SLAV LOSS PLACED AT 45,000.

Both armies : remain ; practically inac

the batteries 'occasionally' engage in a

ter. / Before the door of General Kuro
patkin's quarters are thirteen Japan
ese cannon, captured when the Rus
sian? took the wooded hill (Lone Tree
Hill) on October IS. 'â¢The battle is
now suspended, with a.chasm separat
ing the two armies. The situation
practically is the same as at the
opening of- Kuropatkin's defensive.
The Russians have been unable to se
cure decisive results, and the Jap
anese have been equally unable to do
so. It Is becoming very cold.
"The losses are enormous. There are
30,000 wounded. The roads 1 are terrible.
The Japanese almost stopped firing
during the last few days, leading to
the belief that their ammunition Is
running out. Numerous reports say
that the Japanese are seriously af
fected by the climate, and the indica
fions are that they are going to retire
toward their strong positions at Yen
tai. Everything shows that the bat
tle is only temporarily suspended "
MUKDEN, Oct. 22. â Reports from
the entire Russian front, beginning on
October 17, the day on which the main
fighting ceased, shows that the center
army, from the vicinity of Tashan,
and also the eastern army, 1 behind
Pienchiapu, continued cannonade dem
onstrations for three days. The Jap
anese on October 17 again' began shell
ing the headquarters of the western
army, as the staff was retiring. The
shells in the firing of October 17 fell on
both sides of the railway, destroying a
soup wagon and three horses. No
other damage was infi ifcted.
On October 18 both, armies were
inactive. On the 19 th there were
demonstrations in front of the east
ern army, where constant sniping
continued at short rifle range at Pien
chiapu, at the apex of a triangular po
sition, along the Tang and Shakhe riv
ers. ' Pienchiapu is an exposed town
on the south bank of the Tang River.
In the event of attack it would likely
be untenable, in which case both ar
mier would be left in positions in
strong^ passes on each side of tha .wa
t^i course, which from present Indica
tions is likely to divide the comba;
ants, throughout the winter.
The sparing fire of the Japanese
seems to indicate a shortage of am
munition. Both armies are directing
their main efforts to resupply and re
inforce.
The tenacity of the fighting is un
usual. The Russian troops persist in
their efforts to retrieve their losses in
artillery. It Is reported that an equiv
alent of half the guns lost by them
have been already taken from the
Japanese. The cavalry on both jiides
are reported to be conspicuous in
these exploits, although the Russian
cavalry has not yet realized the im
portance that was expected of it.
Although the Russian army has
again been defeated and is without
possession of any battlefield, yet it has
built mountain roads and transformed
a region for three days' marches by
the Â¦ construction of bridges, telegraph,
lines and defenses since it '.emerged
from the hills north, of the Hun River
on October 4, where it was driven
after the battle of Liaoyang. v
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 22.â -With
the "closing of the week the semi
panic produced by the heavy reverse
sustained by /General Kuropatkin's
army last week has in a great meas
ure disappeared and there is a mu6h
more Cheerful feeling pervading . the
War Office. The general disaster
which threatened to engulf the Man
churian army has been averted and
after ten days of almost continuous
fighting the battle is practically a
. General Kuropatkin has again dis
played consummate skill in prevent
ing Field_ Marshal Oyama reaping the
fruits*of victory. By' withdrawing his
shattered left wing, under "shelter of
the right center /he in the
gigantic task of taking 3000 wounded
off the field of battle, and, more than
this, according to all indications, he
reorganized and reformed 1 his. broken
legions and â¢ again confronts the - Jap
anese across the Shakhe River. '-I
A resumption of the conflict on. a
large scale is believed to be imminent
and St. Petersburg hopes that the
vanquished in last week's battle will
conquer in future fighting.
That General Kuropatkin, after los
ing close to 40,000 men, was able to
resume the offensive within a fort
night constitutes a feat in military
history. ,
RUSSIAN IiEFT ADVANCES. Y
There was an' impression early in
the week ?Â¦ that General Kuropatkin
was concentrating his forces on his
right and center to avoid being driven
off the line of the . railroad, which
might have embarrassed the.^retire
ment of his left, but now he. has had
ample^ time to withdraw and the sit
uation" shows more determination than
ever to secure strong advanced posi
tions across the Shakhe. jit is known
that the left has actually! pushed for
ward slightly and the idea that oper
ations contemplate only rear guard
actions seems negatived, j
Nevertheless, dispatches to the
press from Mukden to-day say that
Kuropatkjn has been fortifying posi
tions on the Hun 'River behind him,
which might indicate that he purposes
only to make an active offensive below
Mukden.. Another "advance by either
side would combine a movement by
flank, but no evidence of anything of
the sort^has yet' developed.
The general staff acts rather mys
teriously. Itsimply attributes the ces
sation of operation's to the natural
exhaustion/of both sides, but does not
offer a clew toiwhat it expects. It is
significant, however, with what satis
faction the news of the capture, of
Shakhe tdwn, at the intersection of
the Shakhe River and the Mandarin
road, was received here. -
VALUE OF SHAKHEPU.
The taking off of the town is con^
sidered, an strategical" gain,
placing General Kuropatkin 1 in com
plete mastery of both sides of the
Shakhe River between the railroad
and the Mukden-Bentsiaputze roads
and assuring his communications
against the*possibility of being cut-off
from the south. . The only poinO on
the left bank of the Shakhe River re
maining in the hands of 'the "Japanese
is Lamuntung, within rifle shot of the
railroad bridge. The bridge presum
ably has been qonfounded with . the

again assumed the aggressive.

Why is appendicitis so common to-
day?
Because we have got into the per-
nicious habit of eating too fast '

ten follows the eating of a very hasty,
or particularly large or indigestible
meal." "

custom you can Insure your safety by
taking Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.

which admits of no dispute, that if
you_jwill only keep your digestive ap-
paratus in good order you will never

as souvenirs.

tie, soothing effect it has on all in-
1'amed conditions of any part of the
Â¦digestive tract.

Better even than Miss Crawley'a
Viola. Is her Rosalind. Her rather
heavy Beatrice left one unprepared
for this Quick and fanciful picture of
Arden's heroine. /Playful yet true
womanly, witty, tender, saucy, capri
cious, boj'ish and yet princess-like is
Miss Crauiey here. As a picture and
as a voice she is of course satisfying,
and wears her doublet and hose most
gallantly. But she reads here with
peculiar and point, and
her face fits every mood of the part.

I found early explanation in the
performance of .something that had
long- puzzled me. Last year I saw
Ben Gre*Â»t at and after thÂ« Nance
O'Neil "As You Like It" at Sutro
Heights. Then I had thought Mr.
Greet a little hard in his Judgment
of the presentation. Yesterday proved
him lenient and gave one a new ideal
of the open air performance. It was,
in fact, hardly short of perfection.
The casting of the players was ad
mirable, the stage management ex
cellent, the detail of the production
delightfully correct. But most not
able was the quaint, delicious gayety
that pervaded the whole performance,
from "the sweet, willful mirth of Miss
Crawley's Rosalind to the dry wag
gishness of Mr. Greet's Touchstone.
Jjjay; began with act II,' and was
confined to the forest scenes. Imme
diately pne was at one with the play
ers. The banished duke asked:
"Now. my co-mates and brothers in
exile.
Hath not old custom made this life
more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not
these woods
More free from, peril than the envious
court?"
Â¦"-'Â¦* *.-,
And*-with him one felt it were easy
and sweet to find:
"tongues in trees, books in the run
ning brooks,
Sermons in stones and good in every
thing."
Very . cleverly the stage was ar
ranged. The trees backing it shaded
the audience from the sun, and every
word spoken could be heard : at every
point of the awditorium. The lenient
day permitted the removal or head
gear, and thus every one could also see
as well as hear. Mrs. Mills 1 "garland
of girls." that sat in lowly state on
cushions below and in front of the
stage, was a conspicuously pretty
feature of the scene. Two small Jap
anese maidens among them, possibly
comparing the players with their own
great Danjuro v touched a picturesque
a;miipiqtuÂ£nt noie. The Occidental au
dience was large, delighted and wholly
sympathetic.
Nay but pen and ink is poor stuff
to paint an "As You Like It" like
yesterday's! Shakespeare himself
must have Joyed in it â one hopes he
was there, Behind one of the waving
elma, or by the campanile that tow
ers over the lawn where Ben Greet
and his players walked aa Rosalind
and Orlando yesterday. Mozart only,
ln the morning: of his genius, could
have eungr the freshness, the fine sim
plicity, the delicate frolic humor of
the thing. It wae the very spring
tide of comedy, comedy in its clear
eyed, joyous-hearted youth, played
blithesomely by a company of gay
lads and lassies headed by that gal
lant stripling, Ben Greet!
Nor less cunningly and .enchanting
ly devised was the setting and pro
logue. Here, for sober fact, the "As
You Like It" was given yesterday af
ternoon at Mills College, on the lawn
afront of the principal building and
for the benefit and endowment of that
admirable Institution. There was a
stage erected at the foot of the lawn
in the midst of the elms and feathered
pine trees. Boughs, leaves and grass
hid the boards and with the framing
trees made an ideal pictured Arden,
Everything conspired to illusion. One
left the twentieth century at Twenty
third avenue station â the leisurely
cars that run therefrom to Mills Col
lege only foretasted the ancientry.
Spring was in the air. in* the sudden
green that ran into the uplands, in
the young blue of the sky. One stop

Quaintly, sweetly, as we wended our
way to the sylvan theater, chimed out
from the campanile "God Save Our
Gracious Queen." We were with the

He was bom in Vallejo and; up to a

Francisco, -lived- in- his ! native city.
He was extremely, popular, 'both; In

Ellis, the pioneer of Marysville's pi

birthday to-morrow. The event prom
ises to be an event In the town's his

a century in Marysville, has a host
of friends in this vicinity. , Ellis is the
head of the W. T. Ellis Company, the
foundation for which was laid by him
In this city in the early fifties, after
he had spent a number of years trying
to wrest a fortune from the mines. The
fact that Ellis is now rated as the
heaviest taxpayer in â¢ Yuba County is
the best evidence that he ' possessed
keen business acumen and that in for
saking the pick and shovel of the
prospector he but displayed that sa
gacity that during the strenuous days
that followed the launching of his
venture made his reputation as a busi
ness man, and added to the wealth
that Is now his.

The latest fad in operations has been
the appendicitis fad; before that the
ir.d for rectal opsrataions (piles, etc.)
held sway. Hundreds of patients were
frightened and hurried into hospitals,
operated upon and robbed of their last
dollar, when the trouble was a simple
ca.se of hemorrhoids or piles only,
easily cared at home with a simple
remedy costing but fifty cents a box.
"I procured one fifty cent box of
Pyramid Pile Cure of my druggist,
with the intention of buying a larger
box later, but was happily surprised
when I found that I was cured, and
still have six pyramids left out of the
Crst and only box. 1 have not had
the least sign of piles since I used this
one box, which has been about , two
months: previous to using Pyramid
Pile Cure I had the worst kind of
bleeding and protruding piles for over
thirty-one years, and no one knows,
except those who have had the piles,
the pain and misery I suffered.
"I am a poor man, but have often
said I would give a fortune, if I had
It, to bo cured of the piles, and now I
have been cured for fifty cents. I
should be very ungrateful if I did not
thank you and give you every priv-
ilege to use my name and this letter,
when I know there are 6O many "who
suffer as I did." J. A. Weismiller, 1100

WILLIAMS, Oct. 22.â The tour of
Duncan McKlnlay through the valley
counties of the Second Congressional
District ended temporarily here to
night, his Itinerary next week taking
him into the coast counties. He was
greeted at the Williams Opera-house
by a representative audience. G. A.
Ware was chairman of the meeting
and introduced Ernest Wriand, the
nominee for the Assembly, who spoke
briefly. McKlnlay spoke for more
than an hour on national issues and
incidentally of his own candidacy* It
was his first appearance before a
Williams- audience, and his hearers
were highly pleased with his elo
quence. His exposition of the polit
ical questions now before the people,
his clear-cut logic and forcible argu
ments made a deep impression upon
all. He received the closest attention,
and was frequently interrupted by ap
plause.
This afternoon McKinlay addressed
a large gathering at Arbuckle, nearly
all present being voters. He made an
excellent- impression and gained many
friends. * This section of the State is
strongly Democratic, but many mem
bers of that party have announced
their intention to vote for Roosevelt.
McKinlay will, hold the full Republi

itable showing at the election. :.

BELLINGHAM, Wash., Oct. 22.â
In the presence of representatives of
both the United States and Great Brit
ain granite monuments were yes
terday unveiled on the army sites on
Ban Juan Island, in Puget Sound,
v/here for many years garrisons were
maintained by each nation while the
territory was in dispute. The occasion
was the thirty-second anniversary of
the award made by Emperor William
of Germany, to whom the controversy
had been submitted for decision. The
exercises yesterday were held under
the auspices of the Washington State
University Historical Society. Delega
tions attended from Seattle, Belllng
ham and other points in the North
west. The United States monitor Wy
oming, commanded' by Captain Cott
man, fired the national salute of twen
ty-one guns at the unveiling of the
monuments.
At American Camp, on Griffin Bay.
where United States troops had estab
lished themselves in 1850 under Cap
tain Pickett, later famous as the leader
of Pickett's charge at Gettysburg, the
ceremonies took place early in the
day. They were presided over by
President Kane of the University of
Washington. In the afternoon the par
ticipants and their guests reached
English Camp, at the other side of the
Island, and dedicated the monument on
the side occupied by Captain George
Bazalxatt and the British troops In
I860. Judge H. B. Hanford of the Fed
eral court of the State of Washing

and delivered an address reviewing
RED . BLUFF, Oct. 22. â Antone
Smith, a prominent rancher from Bend
Colony, died under suspicious circum
stances at the Red Bluff Hotel last
night. Officials are inclined to believe
that his death was caused by. "knock
out drops." ;
Smith sold his ranch a few days ago
and came to Red Bluff. He registered
at the Imperial Hotel and then disap
peared. When he reappeared several
days later at the Red Bluff Hotel and
took a room he had the appearance of
a man who had been on a debauch.
Soon after going to his room he be
came unconscious and remained so for
three days, or until death came.,;- A
search of his pockets revealed the sum
of $40. Whether he had more when
he first came to town is not known.
An investigation will be made.

PEORIA, 111., Oct. 22. â Some un
known person may have inflicted the
Injuries upon Mrs. Nellie Thomasson.
from which she died, according to
friends of young Higgins, who is un
der arrest charged with the crime.
The evidence brought out at the
Coroner's inquest showed that the
woman walked to the train at the sta
tion in, this city with but slight as
sistance from one of the employes of
the road and that when she arrived at
Lacon she summoned a hack and
made her way to the home of her
mother, several blocks away without
assistance. She # did not summon a
physician until sixteen hours later, and
these facts tend to prove, it is asserted,
that Mrs. Thomasson was not fatally
hurt by young Higgins, but by some
one else after she left the depot where
she had encountered Higgins and his
sister. . -l"'"J r ; ;?

When it became known that the
Grand Jury had recommended that
Higgins be held for murder, there was
a remarkable demonstration on the.
part of his friends, who flocked to his
assistance.
Mrs. Higgina, wife of John G. Hlg
gin. gave out a statement to-day. She
said that the intimacy between her
husband and Mrs. Thomasson began
three years ago. The couple, she says,
made a trip to Chicago together and
later he devoted all his attention to
Mrs. Thomasson. His son, Daniel Hig
gins, remonstrated with him, but un
availingly.
In this, connection, but so far there has
been no positive evidence against him.
In Wisconsin the Presidential elec
tion is incidental to the State con
test. Roosevelt's chances of carrying
the State are believed to be good and
there is a probability that Governor
La Follette will be elected by a great
ly reduced plurality. There probably
will be a considerable loss in the Re
publican Congressional delegation.
Montana is doubtful and will con
tinue to be doubtful until the count
ing of the ballots. The Democratic
State ticket probably will be elected.
Colorado is likely to go Democratic
on the State ticket and is in doubt on
the national ticket. The chances
seem to favor Roosevelt.
Utah seems to be assured for Roose
velt. Idaho also seems likely to go
for the Republican national ticket.
Nevada is conceded to Parker by 1200
plurality.
WISCONSIN SEEMS SAFE.
Rhode Island is apparently safely
anchored in the Republican column.
The ODinlon is general that Roose
velt will get the election. On the
other hand, the belief is widespread
that Garvin. the Democratic candi
date for Governor, will be elected.
cratlc or make it safely Republican.
In West Virginia State issues are
still attracting attention and the Re
publican State ticket seems likely to
be defeated. At present the Repub
lican national ticket seems to have
the lead, but the Democrats are hope
ful.
Â¦ Among the letters read was one from
Mayor George H. Williams of Port
land, Or., who is the sole surviving
member of the American commission
which presented the United States'
side of the dispute. Other letters were
from Hamilton Fish of New York, son
of President Grant's Secretary of
State, who was also a member of the
commission, and from Hazard Stevens,
son of Isaac Stevens, pioneer Governor
of Washington Territory.
the history of the dispute, which near
ly provoked war. -General George B.
Dandy (retired), who was with Cap
tain PIckett, told the story of how the
killing of a British settler's pig by an
American settler on the island in the
fifties , ; led â¢ to international complica
tions, causing the' two garrisons to

"vbkfrig war." â "^
There is a dull campaign in Dela
ware and the State Is doubtful, with
the chances slightly favoring the Re
publicans. Money in this State can
change conditions and turn it Demo-
The Democrats also are in a fair
way to make Congressional gains, ow
ing to the lack of incentive to activity
because of the combination effected
In Delaware between the Addicks and
enti-Addicks Republicans.
Maryland is apparently going Dem
ocratic. There is a strong drift in
that State toward the Democracy be
cause of the race issue raised by the
President. "With the exception of this
issue conditions are similar to those
which prevailed in the State prior to
1Â£96.
In New Jersey the Democratic State
ticket is stronger than the national
ticket, and the contest Is largely on
State issues. If this were not a Presi
dential year the Democratic candidate
for Governor probably would be elect
ed. The Republicans give Roosevelt
S5.000 plurality and Stokes, for Gover
nor, over Black, from 13,000 to 15,000.
The Democrats claim the State for
both State and national tickets.
MARYLAND DEMOCRATIC.
Connecticut is inclined toward Roose
velt, as is admitted even by the sup
porters of Judge' Parker. The Bryan
element in that state will refuse to sup
port the Democratic ticket solidly and
the Bryan men are even now planning
to reorganize the party immediately
after the election.
XETW YORK. Oct. 22.â Reports to the
Herald from correspondents who have
been investigating the progress of the
Presidential canvass In the doubtful
States reveal an active lining up of
the opposing forces. The last two
weeks of the campaign will be crowded
with hard work and in come of the
States the result bids fair to be ex
tremely doubtful until election night.
In New York the battle is going on
with great vigor. The all-engrossing
topic is the State election. It , is ad
mitted still that Higgins will run far
behind the Republican national ticket.
He has, however, made some headway
and this seems to have been reflected
by the betting. Mr. Roosevelt is a
strong candidate and hope for the Re
publican State ticket rests entirely on
the expectation of the Odell organiza
tion that Roosevelt will have a plural
ity leading enough to "pull Higgins
through."
For Instance, it Is estimated that In
nineteen counties in Western New
York Mr. Roosevelt will have a plural
ity of 65.000â2251 less than McKlnley
had In 1900â and that Higgins will be
12,000 behind. Such a cut In the rest
of the State might throw the Republi
can candidate for Governor SO.000 or
100,000 votes behind in the State.
REPUBLICAN'S HAVE INDIANA.
The Republicans seem to have In
diana at present, but Democratic con
ditions have improved since Bryan took
the stump for Parker and Democrats
are making an effort to swing that
State in the last weeks of the cam
paign. Seventy-five per cent of the
Gold Democrats are supporting Parker.
The Bryan Democrats have been
solidified. Party conditions, therefore,
are normal, and the Republicans have
to fight hard to hold the State.

''Several years ago my husband be-
came affected by a most disagreeable
aiid painful diarrhea, lost his appetite
and grew shockingly thin and haggard.
I persuaded him finally to see a physi-
cian, but after taking a course of medi-
cine he was worse, than ever and this
discouraged him bo he tried a lot of
home-made remedies, but they gave
him only temporary relief.
"Finally I persuaded him to. try an-
other physicah, who treated him for
indigestion, which he said was the
cause of ail his trouble, but after sev-

said: 'You have let it run so long it

thought he would just give it a short
triaL' To our surprise ; he began to
improve at once. He. kept on each
day .'getting better and better until now
he can eat anything he likes and de-
clares he never felt so well in his life,
has absolutely no troubble with his
stomach or bowels and is fleshier than
he has been for years. Three cheers
for Grape Nuts." Name given by Pos-

BERKELEY. Oct. 22.â Fire was
discovered in the City Hall on Grove,
street at 1:40 o'clock this afternoon
and an hour later the structure had
burned to the ground. Only the brick
vault in the City Clerk's office re
iriained etandlng. In the vault were
all the records of the clerk's office.
Most of the other city officials were
given sufficient warning to permit the
removal of their office furniture and
records. The loss to the city will be
about $15,000. The amount of insur
ance cannot be determined at this
time.
Defective lighting wires in the attic
are believed to have caused the flre.
City Clerk Merrill discovered smoke is
suing from the roof and telephoned to
the Fire Department. The firemen's
work was rendered futile by an in
eufficiency of water. Four streams
Â«ere turned on the fire, each compara
tively feeble and ineffective. The
building was a frame structure and
burned like tinder. Ten minutes after
the flames were discovered the firemen
pave up hope of saving any part of it.
They cut oft* all but one stream, con
centrating this on the City Clerk's
vault, to make certain the saving of
the records there.
Street Superintendent Turner locked
all the records and papers in his office
in a large safe. The safe stood in a
corner of the room on the top floor
and remained there until all surround
ing portions of the floor had fallen.
When its supports were burned away
it. great crash announced to the throng
of spectators that the safe, weighing
4000 pounds, had dropped to the base
ment. It remained intact, despite the
Call.
Justice Edgar's court dockets were
all destroyed, with all his court papers
and furniture.
Auditor Hanscomb "Saved his papers,
as did also Surveyor Huggins, who
sustained a severe cut on -the scalp, a
chandelier falling on him while he was
removing his records. A crowd of
high school boys worked valiantly to
rescue furniture and papers from the
burning building. With their efforts
and those of the firemen and officials
nearly every book and paper of value
is believed to have been rescued from
the flames.
"I am not 8 Me to tell what Insur
ance, if any. there- was on the build
ing." said Clerk Merrill. "The Trus
tees had voted not to reinsure the
building, but whether the policies have
all lapsed remains to be. seen by con
sulting the records, which are in the
vault of my office. Besides the loss of
the building and its furniture, the city
will lose the money recently spent for
an elaborate electric switchboard and
corresponding system, costing $150')."
V A report that the Gamewell flre
alarm in the hall had started the blaze
was refuted by Superintendent Ryder
of the fire alarm system, who said
that BOO volts charging current was
turned off at 9 o'clock this morning as
usual. All the wire connections of the
fire alarm system ran into the hall
In fireproof cables. If the Gamewell
system had started the blaze, said
Superintendent Ryder, it could not
have turned in an alarm, as it did,
fifteen minutes after the fire started.
Fire Chief Kenney complained bitter
ly of the lack of water with which to
fight the flames. He reported that
Arthur Higgs of Hose Company No. 2.
and Archie Edgar, of Engine No. 2, had
been overcome by the smoke and were
obliged to be taken to their homes.
C. D. Maloney, superintendent of the
Contra Costa Water Company in
Berkeley, said that the use of four
streams by the firemen "nullified the
strength of the pressure," and that if
one stream only had been used the
pressure would have been ample to
force it to any part of the building.
The City Hall was moved from Sacra
mento and University avenues about
four years ago. It was valued at $15,
000. The Town Trustees had consider
ed including $75,000 for a new city hall
in the bond project recently abandoned,
but their final decision was against
erecting a new hall. The matter will
be given consideration again at the
Trustees' regular meeting next Mon
day night. Temporary quarters for the
city officials have been engaged in the
Shattuck block.

Oct. 22.â Arthur Dodd,
13 years of age, was accidentally Bhot
and killed . by his father, Vincent A.
Dodd, ."shortly before noon to-day
while the two were' hunting ducks in
a boat off the south end of- Caroline
street. With a heart rending cry,
"Oh, papa, ( you have- hurt me, you
have hurt me," the unfortunate child
clung to his distracted parent's neck
as his life blood gushed from a gaping
wound in his right side. He lived'but
a few -minutes after receiving the ter
rible injury and when the agonized
parent beached the hunting craft his
boy, rigid, in death, still hugged him
closely.
After tenderly carrying' his son's
body from the boat and laying it upon
the sand the father gave way to his
great grief. His cries attracted the
attention of several persons, who
went to his assistance and induced
him to go to his home / at 1031 Tay
lor avenue. Dr. W. Tappan Lum was
summoned to attend the lad, but a
glance revealed to' the physician that
the little fellow was beyond human
aid. Deputy Coroner James Fowler
was notified and the remains were
taken to the local branch morgue and
later removed to,the undertaking par
lors of Smiley & Gallagher, . from
where the funeral will be held Mon
day morning at 10 o'clock.
Between his paroxysms of grief Mr.
Dodd explained that he was in the
bow of the boat when the accident
occurred. He was in the act of turn
ing toward the stern of the craft to
shoot at a duck when his shotgun, a
12-bore automatic weapon, exploded
and the charge took effect in his son's
right Eide, tearing away the liver and
causing a hemorrhage that quickly
brought death.
Arthur Dodd was a native of this
city and an exceptionally bright lad
for his years. His father is the su
perintendent of the Yosemite laundry
in Oakland and is prominent In fra
ternal and athletic circles. The fate
of her youngest son has prostrated
Mrs. Dodd and her condition is seri
ous. . )'

Pining for freedom, Ranlma Ara
mancha Sengh, the alleged Hindoo
Prince incarcerated in the County
Jail," attempted suicide last night by
hanging himself to the bars of his
cell. But for an accident by which a
cellmate was awakened Sengh would
have been a corpse this morning. In
order to see how to tie the rope he
set fire to a piece of paper; then he
swung off, as he supposed, Into the
great beyond. The paper fell upon
the sleeper below, who awakened with
a shriek. thinking the jail was on fire.
Jailer Pete .White was attracted by
the noise and going to the cell no
ticed the form of Sengh hanging to
a rope made of strips of blanket A
noose was around Sengh's neck and
the other end of the rope was tied to a
crossbar near the ceiling. He was
cut down and resuscitated. He said
when revived that he was tired of
prison life, -v
Sengh claims to be the son of the
Maharajah of Lahore. He was sen
tenced to serve six months in the
County Jail for stealing $60 from a
serving man of "Chris" Buckley at
Ravenswpod, near Llvermore. ~
Albert Miller, a prisoner in the City
Prison, attempted suicide this after
noon by cutting the arteries in his
wrists with a razor. Before any one
saw what he was doing Miller secured
the razor allowed prisoners on Sat
urdays to shave with and cut both
his wrists and was bleeding profusely
when discovered a. few minutes later.

Armed with a big revolver and bar
ricaded in a saloon at 1701 "Willow
street, from which he had driven the
bartender and proprietor, George Pat
rick, a negro residing at "West Oak
land, maintained a reign of terror for
more than an hour early this morning
and was not subdued until he had
been disabled by a bullet in the arm
from the revolver of Policeman Con
Keefe. The policeman dfd not shoot
the negro until after he had fired two
sho'ts Into" the wall over the infuri
ated man's head fn an ineffectual at
tempt to frighten him into submission.
Keefe went to the saloon in answer
to a call from C. O'Levia, the propri
etor, who Bald that Patrick had driven
every one out of the place and was
wrecking the fixtures. The policeman
found the doors barricaded and was
forced to break a panel out of the
rear door in order to see where the
negro was. As soon as Keefe's face
appeared at the opening Patrick cov
ered him with his revolver and said.
"If you try to get In here I'll kill you."
Keefe reached for his own pistol and
as he did so Patrick snapped his gun
in the policeman's face, but the cart
ridge failed to explode. Keefe fired
two shots into the wall to frighten the
negro, and as the fellow continued to
try to fire his own weapon Keefe shot
him through the left arm above the
elbow. The door was then broken
down and after a hard struggle Keefe
succeeded in handcuffing the negro,
who was sent to the Receiving Hos
pital, where his wound was dressed,
and thence to the City Prison.

2148 Center Street, Oct. 22.
Coming to Berkeley to pay his' taxes
on Dwight way property, transferred
to him by his father many years ago,
James Irvine, a San Francisco capir
talist, made the astonishing discovery
that he had no property -In this city,
and that valuable land which he sup
posed he owned had been sold,
through the medium of a forged deed,
to Milton Shepardson of San Francis
co. The swindle was perpetrated a
year ago, and on the land which Ir
vine thought he owned Shepardson
has erected three fine houses.
Irvine was informed by the town
authorities that, despite'' his desire to
pay taxes in Berkeley, no land in the
university town. stood in his name.
Then Irvine, amazed and indignant,
walked to Dwight way. near Tele
graph avenue, and there rubbed his
eyes as he beheld the three new
houses that stood on - land . he had
owned for many years.
Inquiries made by him developed
that E. J. Stewart, a real estate dealer
of Oakland, sold the lots to Shepard
son a year ago for a stranger, rep
resenting himself to be James Irvine
of San Francisco. Stewart tells of
meeting the false Irvine, whom he
supposed to be the real owner of the
Berkeley land, and of selling the lots
to Shepardson for $4500, a price be
low their value, the land, being now
estimated as worth $10,000. The
stranger gave his address as Stonevllle,
Phillips County, Miss.. He received
$4500 of Shepardson's money, through
Stewart, and left the country. The
tleed to Shepardson was recorded on
November 2, 1903. Mr. Stewart said:
"In October,- 1903, a man claiming
to be James Irvine came to me, rep
resenting that he owned property in
Berkeley. He said he had purchased
it twenty-five years ago, was tired of
paying taxes, and wished to dispose
of it before he returned East. He de
scribed the property as a lot. on
Dwight way, 150 feet front by 300 feet
in depth, 150 feet east of Telegraph
avenue. He said that he would ac
cept $4500 cash for the property. I
secured a purchaser and paid a de
posit on the property. "Irvine* at once
made out a deed," which was placed
in the First National; Bank of this
city to be delivered upon payment of
the balance due.
"I ordered a search of the property
made and found that it was owned by
James Irvine and that the conditions
were all as he had stated regarding
the time of the previous transfer.
"I sold the property to Milton Shep
ardson, a San Francisco attorney, and
on account of my receiving no com
mission for the transaction it was
agreed that I should have an interest
in the profits of the property. Mr.
Shepardson has since built three
houses on the land, mortgaging the
three lots on which they stand to
raise the money for their construction.
"The real James Irvine has told me
that he does not wish the holders of
these mortgages to lose anything;
hence he will pay a reasonable amount
for the improvements in order to
clear the title to the property. Mr.
Irvine says that he does not hold
either Mr. Shepardson or myself re
sponsible for the swindle, as we were
both victims of a clever bunko man.
"The bogus Irvine was a man about
65 years old, rather short and heavy
set, with a heavy dark mustache. : He
was well dressed and had the appear
ance of a man of wealth and refine
ment."

A Judgment in favor of the Regents
of the State University and against W.
A. Knowles for $14,000 was handed
down to-day by Judge S. P. Hall. The
rcatter has been long in litigation and
is all the university can get out of a
claim of nearly $30,000. Little or
nothing could have been recovered had
not most of the 160 other defendants
allowed the suits against them to go
by default and failed to plead the
statute of limitation.
The suit was the outcome of the
purchase by Knowles of the Tompkins
tract from the Regents in 1830. There
were forty acres for which he was to
pay $50,000. He paid $10,000 down
and gave a mortgage for the balance.
Then* he began to divide and sell the
land. He was given releases of the
lots as they were paid for, but it was
afterward found that lots that had
not been paid for had been Interpolat
ed in the releases. He was tried for
forgery and acquitted. So much time
was wasted in bringing suit that many
were exempted from the Judgment.
Knowles thus saved some $10,000 and
enough others to make up a total of
about $14,000. or half the amount sued
for. 'ri Â¦ .

â¢ them call me a quack, because I pay for my advertising., But thev
all admit that electricity will increase strength. That is all I claim for it.- That's all you want, any way. Ifyou have enough strength you'll
never be weak, nor suffer a pain.
It used to be considered sensible to take drugs to "wake up" sluggish circulation, to weak nerves, to make the stomach' tate food
that it was too weak to "digest.'- and then another drug to drive this food through the intestines which were too weak to do their work. ". Men would
take drugs to make them sleep and an eye-opener in the' morning to make them feel as if they had rested â all dope.
It is well known now that ne ar iy every dru<* contains from one-half to nine-tenths alcohol, and the rest poison. I'm no advocate of the intem-
peratcuse of alcohol, but if you have to take it, why can't you take it without the poison? It is proven that in thirty minutes after a drug' is
taken the physical vitalitv is five per cent lower than before taking the drugâ that is. after the stimulation has passed off.
Taking stimulants is like borrowing money for half an hour at five per cent interestâ you borrow a dollar and pay back's dollar five in half
an hour. If that scheme kept up would break your bank account, it will just as surely break you down physically. Wouldn't it? Â»
Nature will stand a" good deal of punishment but she will not, stand it always. She gives you a.strong body to start with, and demands an
accounting. . â¢ v
' My method is to helo nature â to add artificial vitalitv to that you already have. Every one of us has a certain amount, according to our
strength, because vitalitv is strength.; When you lose some of-this vitality you are weak â a weak man. My appliance pours a fresh suoolv into
your body while you sleep. It generates electricity, and pumps that into your nerves. Professor Loeb says that it is the basis of vitality, and
my cures prove it.
Mr. Emile'Do're, Ivy. Modoc County, Cal., writes me: "I have had no indication of my old weakness since I havo worn your Belt, and the varlcocels'ts
yielding nicely. I am well pleased." 'â¢ v - . . â¢
Now, if you don't feel right, I can cure you with my Electric Belt. If you .are. full of rheumatic pains. I can knock them out, I can ooar
oil into your joints and limber them up. I ;have ; often "said that pain and. electricity can't live in the same house, and I prove it every day.
Mr.-L..J.Barnett of Tillamobk/ Or.; writes: "Your treatment certainly does what no other can, for it has cured me. I cannot praise the Belt too highly
and gladly recommend it it in any case of .vital weakness." *
If it were not for. the breiudice due to the; great number of fakes in the land I would not be able to handle the business that would come to
me. The "Free Belt'.' r fraud and' the '"Free Drug" scheme, which are not free at all," have made every one skeptical/but I know that I have a good
thing, and 111 hammer away until you; know it.
Â¦One thing every man ought to know is this:* Your bodv is a machine. It is rurj bythe steam in your blood and nerves. When you begin to
breakdown in; any \yay^ you ; are; out- of steam. That's just what I want to give ; au b:\ck. '
Mr. A. Hubbs of Calistbga, Cal.. says: 1 "My rheumatism has entirely disappeared, my digestion is perfect, I have gained eight pounds In weight and all
the symptoms of weakness are gone, which is^ remarkable, considering my age."
I have a cure in every town. Tell me where you-live and I will give you the name of a man I've cured.
Tell me your trouble and I will itell you honestly whether I can cure you or not. If I can't cure you I don't want your money. I have been
in this business 22 years! and I amthe biggest man in it to-dav bv long odds,, and I am growing vet. because I give every man all he pavs for.

Mrs. Magglio flew into a passion
and, deliberately heating a stove poker
to a white heat, caught her child and,
assisted by the other woman, tried
to Â£Â°rce the iron ii\to his mouth. The
boy fought frantically and in the
struggle some horrible burns were in
flicted, one on the inside of the mouth
being fully six Inches long and very
deep. His hands and face were also
badly burned.
The case has "aroused great indigna
tion here.
While seated at the table, the Mag
glio woman's son. Giccomo Magglio,
aged about 4 years, asked his mother
for another cur> of coffee and because
it was refused he called her a yile
name. Another woman, who lives
with the Magglio - family, exaggerated
the child's offense | and is said to have
remarked: "If a child of mine said
that to me I would burn his tongue
out." ',,"â¢'
SANTA BARBARA, Oct. 22. â One

yesterday when Mrs. Magglio, a Span

H. Rice's court on a battery charge,
preferred by the Chief of Police. She
pleaded guilty^ to having tortured her
infant son to 'discipline him for call

The denouement of a fascinating
love story was enacted yesterday Â¦ aft
ernoon at Trinfty Church with beauti-J
ful Laura Sanchez Scott and Frederick
Lewin playing the leading roles. The
wedding was a quiet affair, without the
trite embellishments of -attendants,
bridal robes, veils and customary ac
coutrements. In a . brown > traveling
gown, a broad plumed hat, with -an
armful of violets, the attractive south
ern maid plighted her troth.
The ceremony, performed by the
Rev. Mr. Rigby, was attended by a
coterie of close friends and by many
relatives, who offered their ibenisoris
and godspeeds^in the chapelâ a recep-'
tion that for spontaneity will 5 prove ; a
pretty memory. Among the guests
were:; 'Mrs. Monroe Salisbury, .! Mrs.'
Alexander D. , Keyes, Mrs. T. : Danf orth

There will be no noticeable color line
when Jimmy Britt and Joe Gans meet
on the last night of this month, if the
tanning progress that Britt has hit
upon In his training develops the hue he
expects it will. The elements that Britt
Is depending upon to make him look
like an Irish Ethiop are salt water and
salt breezes' applied to his physique In
unlimited quantities . while the subject
sits in a row boat attired In swimming
tights. .___
, Jimmy took Â¦ his first color treatment
yesterday morning . under the direction
of Professor Krellng when he pulled
ten . miles , in a skiff. He , set from hla
training quarters at Croll's Gardens
and . rowed for five , miles along the
south 'side of Alameda, returning over
the same ! route. When' Britt disem
barked'he was several shade's browner
than when he the voyage. He
believes it is only a matter of a few
more-- voyages when he can show an
epidermis that will match the Gans'
hue i and then there will be no color
line.
"I am taking the nature man's treat
ment," said Jimmy yesterday, "and I
am - inclined to : accept .the theory that
the .exposure of the body, to the winds
of heaven and the waves" of the bay Is
healthful and toughening. I do not
aspire to be tough In the generally ac
cepted meaning of the word, but I do

fied by the -Congressional Record,
show beyond all shadow of doubt that
the credit belongs to, the Republican
Congress as a- body 'and to Senator

failed Perkins "succeeded. The record
is there and cannot be obliterated.
Senator Perkins was willing that ' Beli

The election will, take place two
weeks from next Tuesday. K Present
indications are that California will
give 50,000 majority for Roosevelt and
Fairbanks and elect a solid Republi
can delegation to represent the "State
in Congress.
In* the First District the able and
popular J. N. Gillettwill surely.be re
-elected by an increased majority. He
is conducting a splendid campaign,
winning strength in every county of
Jhe vast district. Yesterday Judge
Melvin of Oakland left San Francisco
to Join Senator Thomas Selvage in a
speaking tour of Humboldt County.
The verdict will surely come from the
north that Melvin once heard must
be heard again.

make several speeches^ in the Second
District. All Sonoma- County and many
people from' adjoining , counties . will
be in Santa; Rosa Monday nlgh't, No

of the' second half and on the first' play
Weller came around left end for t thirty
yards. Dole, Chalmers and =Weller
made : from five to fifteen, yards at a
clip down the gridiron and the big full
back .plunged through; for." the. second
touchdown. '.SprottV kicked 'the goal

Near the.close.of the first half Stan
fordran the .ball from her forty-yard
line to ; Nevada's . thirty-yard . line and
then lost if on a fumble.'.. The Â¦ visitors
fuinbled in .turn shortly afterward and
the cardinal pushed through for steady,
gains until Chalmers was sent over the

kicked the goal. ..r'ii'.,.
SPROTT KICKS BOTH GOALS.
There is some question as to .whether
the football game between Stanford
University and- the University of Ne
vada Â¦ or the rooting of i some fair sym
pathizers of 'the sagebrushers.- in the
grandstand afforded the greater enter
tainment yesterday at Palo Alto. There
was plenty, of fun in both. The cardinal
had an " easy thing of it and when the
moon looked over the fence as the; last
half dre w ' to a close , the score was 17
to 0 inÂ»favor,of the home eleven.
Dole /and Sprott. were . back- in , the
game for Stanford. Both men, played
splendidly." The team work of the'ear-"
dinal showed great improvement/which
is J*a worthy, tribute to ' Reid's
excellent : *i coachlp g .'^ as ~Â£] transferred

rest was accomplished 'without diffi

fpr i the visitors' and " in ; this way" pre- Â¦

Dole was almost sure of- making a
good gain , every time he went at" the
line. .Weller' also did better than he
has done : before this- season. /. Stanford
worked that favorite outside-of-tackle
play for yards upon yards. â¢ The ; lads
from across the border "were able to
stop the other line plays. Both elevens
fumbled repeatedly, without any rea
sonable excuse. " >.â"â¢ Â»Â¦Â»
i Before leaving he visited the various
heads of departments and also the
railroad Â¦ mail ; clerks in the upper' part
of the building. No. . politics, was
mentioned in the. course of 7 the visit.
Yesterday; morning, at an early hour
Mr. Hayes -visited the - different car
houses of the United Railroads of San
POLITICS XOT MENTIONED.
Without formal notice of his inten
tion to meet the clerks of the Post
oflice departments of the city and the
mail carriers, Hayes visited their
headquarters at the ferry yesterday
and met the 600 men employed there.
It is the first time for at least many
years that an aspirant for Congres
sional honors has been able to meet
these employes of the Federal Govern
ment. He shook hands with all of
them anÂ«l was most cordially received.
Whatever the candidates of the Dem
ocratic party, have, promised; the mall
carriers and clerks In regard to an in
crease of wages or . a*-" betterment of
their condition, it is a. fact too well
known to admit of dispute' tha.t Dem
ocratic Congressmen, as, members of a
llcpublican House, will have little or
no power in the next Congress to ob
tain the passage of any measure pro
posed by them. .
It requires one in sympathy with
the administration to do this. Mr.
Hayes has forcibly expressed himself
unon the question of higher wages for
postal employes. He believes that
none of them should receive less than
$100 a month and has pledged himself
for vigorous action to secure this end.
The employes knew of this . on the
occasion of his visit and- also knew
the intense sympathy that he has with
all wageworkers.
VISITS POSTOFFICE.
Prom now on till the close of the,
campaign there district clubs will hold
a series of meetings, so that the work
so well begain will not lose Its inter
est through lack of Initiative on the
part of those whose interests are most
at stake. At the majority of these
meeting Mr. Hayes will be the prin
cipal speaker. His knowledge of tho
conditions that caused the panic of
the Cleveland administrations lends to
each, of his speeches added interest,
and he never fails to hold his audi
ences and win their ' approval. His
viewB on the Chinese question are also
of interest to every workman on the
coast, and, unalterably opposing Chi
r.ese and all Oriental labor as he is.
this fact will be taken Into considera
tion on election day by all those that
believe the work of America should be
done by Americans and at American
wages.
But while Mr. Hayes* opponents are
desperately searching for a vulnerable
poir.t by which his candidacy may be
weakened, he is going ahead with his
campaign. And his friends are as vig
orous in their efforts in' his behalf as
he is in his own. In every Assembly
district included in the Fifth Con
gressional District a Hayes club has
be^n formed. At the headquarters of
each of these clubs some one is in
charge throughout the day giving out
information and reciting facts that
are vote winners.
CAMPAIGN' PROGRESSES.
Last Sunday the Examiner opened
a broadside on Hayes. It was assert
ed that the Pastors' Union of San Jose
â¢was opposed to the election of the
Republican nominee. Several inter
views were given in which clergymen
were quoted as saying that they were
antagonistic to Hayes. The San Jose
Mercury comes forward with a page
containing positive statements from
the pasiors themselves that they are
favorable to Mr. Hayes* election. Un
der this heading the Mercury replies
to the Examiner's broadside:
"Pastors renudiate the Examiner
and . brand its alleged interviews as
false. Not a gambling game in a sa
loon of San Jose. Attack on city wan
tonly false. Attitude of citizens gross
ly misrepresented in Examiner ar
ticles. Pastors' Union not antagonis
tic to Mi*. Hayes. There is no law
and order league here. Xo gambling
games in San Jose saloons. Citizens
misquoted. Regret that political cap
ital was made out of what had, no
euch bearing. Rev. W. S. Kelly says
that the . Examiner reporter's chief
purpose in interviewing him seemed
to be to obtain some statement from
him against Mr. Hayes or the city ad
ministration."
E. A. Hayes of San Jose Is going to
win back to the Republican column
the Fifth Congressional District * of
California. His campaign Is progress
las: In a tray that has alarmed his
Democratic and Union Labor oppo
nents and thrown despair Into the
camp of his enemies. Representing
us he does the great principles of Re
publicanism, having learned of their
soundness through Â¦ personal experi
ence, which he makes known to every
audience he addresses, his position in/
the fight Is one that leaves no point of
attack for his adversaries save by un
fair means and falsehoods.
Ministers of San
Jose Disprove
Charges.
PASTORS FAVOR
HIS CANDIDACY

to Find Point

"Uneasy rests the head that wears
a crown." It's an old saying but it
still goes. Kings are scarce in . the
cosmopolitan seaport town of San
Francisco, but there is a real one In
the person of Mike Fisher and his
crown is nearly in. It has been tot
tering for many days past, but yester
day its career of usefulness was about
at an end, for Oakland shot in ahead
of the Timers once more at Recreation
Park. Score, 1 to 0.
Sensation after sensation was pulled
off In rapid succession till the fans
firmly believed a run was not to be
had even If the game went a hundred
innings." But a ball game is never
over till the last man Is benched.
Streib had fanned In the ninth and
Devereaux gloomily walked up to the
pan.
A pop fly left Red's club and soared
out to right field. "Eat that up,
Mike," quoth Mr. Doyle to Mr. Lynch.
Mr. Lynch had no appetite for such a
fly*and stood admiring it from a dis
tance. Mr. Doyle at last decided to
make a meal of It himself, but his
appetite failed at the last moment and
the ball slipped through his mitts.
A mighty roar went up when Stark
shot a fast one through to right field.
Again Mr. Doyle was attacked with
the jimmies and this time the ball did
serpentine stunts on the ground. Both
Devereaux and Stark kept tearing
along, the former pulling up at third
and the latter at second.
"Win your own game, Schmiddy,"
yelled the multitude as Pretzel strut
ted proudly to the pan. He posed pic
turesquely waiting for the first ball. On
it came a' trifle wide. It struck Ho
gan's mitt and bounded to one side.
Every fan in the lot rose to his feet to
urge Devereaux on. He came, sur
rounded by a cloud of dust, sliding in
safely under Keefe Just as the ball
reached the pitcher's mitt.
The story of the game was the
pitching of Schmidt and Keefe. Both
worked as they never worked before
and both received support that would
fill any slabman with a desire to win.
The Oaks erred but once behind the
game little German. The Tigers threw
their gallant college lad down in the
last inning after he had labored so
hard to bring victory home. The
score:

Columbus, Ohio, May 15, 1903.
Some four years ago I was suffering
from impure blood and a general run-
down condition of the system. I had no
appetite, was losing flesh, and had an all-
gone tired feeling that made me misera-
ble. I began the use of S . S. S., and
after taking seven or eight bottles my skin
Was cleared of all eruptions and took on a
ruddy, healthy glow that assured me that
my blood had been restored to its nor-
mal, healthy condition. My appetite was
restored, as I could eat anything put be-
fore me, and as I regained my appetite
I increased in weight, and that "tired feel-
ing" which worried me so much disap-
peared, and I was once again my old self.
I heartily recommend S. S. S. as the
best blood purifier and tonic made, and
strongly advise its use to all those in need
of such medicine. Victor Stubbins.
Cor. Barthman and Washington Aves.
Wheeling, W. V., May _3, xgot.
_ My system was run down and my joints
ached and pained me considerably. I had
used S. S. S. before and knew what it
was, so I purchased a bottle of it and have
taken several bottles and the aches and
pains are gone, my blood has been cl eas-
ed and my general health built up. I can
testify to it as a blood purifier and tonic.

with a somewhat easier feeling, December be
ing a shade higher to %@>Â£c Tower at $1 15Vi
to $1 15%. May was a shade higher to Y*ii
%c lower at $1 1401 14%. Not enough wheat
was offered to supply the demand and in eon
seauence prices made a rapid advance. De
cember rising to $1 ltJli. Meantime May 'sold
up to $1 15H- The continued bullishness of
the cash situation was the chief underlying
factor affecting early trading. On the ad
vance there was a heavy selling by a leader
of the bull crowd, conservative estimates plac
ing his total sales at nearly. 1,000.000 bushels,
most of which was May. Alarmed by the per
sistent selling, pit traders changed front and
sold freely. Prices declined as rapidly aa
they had previously risen. .Trading, however,
was quiet during the last half-hQur. 5 The
market closed practically at the lowest point
of the day. After selling at $1 15, December
closed at $1 15%, a net loss of %c. Â¦ Final
Quotations on May were $1 13%.
Firm cables and a good cash demand caused
some strength in corn. December closed- a
shade lower at 48%@48%c
Little interest was manifested in oats. De
cember closed at 28 %c.
The early provision market was strong on
buying. At the - close January pork was Â¦ un

JAMAICA. Oct. 22. â Three heavily
backed good things went through in
to-day's races in James R. Keene's
Augur, winner of the fourth race;
Thomas Stewart's Cannon Ball, win
ner of the fifth race, and Mrs. Charles
Cochran's Sonoma Belle, winner of
the sixth race. Judging by the fact
that all three closed at much smaller
odds than were exhibited at the open
ing of the betting and the further fact
that certain shrewd operators are
known to have won heavily on Augur
and Sonoma Belle, the day must be
put on record as a bad one for the
bookmakers.
