ST. LOL1S, July 6. â Unless the radicals make an extended fight against the majority reports of the committees on credentials and resolutions, thus causing a protracted session, it is probable that the Democratic convention will
proceed to the nomination of candidates to-morrow. The outlook late to-night is that Parker will win on . the first ballot. The rout of the opposition is complete. Even some of the delegations instructed
for other candidates are breaking away and scrambling aboard the Parker band-wagon. The California delegationâ representatives of Hearst's own State â will stand by its candidate only until his defeat is assured, when it
will swing to whomsoever it chooses, regardless of the wishes of the editor. This means that the delegation will switch its vote to Parker, probably at the end of the first rollcall. Stevenson of Illinois and Tag

VICTORY FOR PARKER
ON THE FIRST BALLOT
Senator J. W. Bailey of Texas and
Representative Champ Clark of Mis
souri to-night declined to accept the
permanent chairmanship of the Demo
crat! ve National Convention. When
the committee on permanent organiza

in nomination and the former was
elected by a vote of 18 to 16. The com
mittee then - - unanimously. . elected
The Bryan men are determined to
make minority reports from both com
mittees and discuss these on the floor
of the convention. There is no way to
prevent this last-ditch struggle, if they
continue to hold to their plans to-mor
row.
ST. LOUIS. July 6.â Judge Parker
â¢will be nominated for President to
morrow. If the session is not consumed
in the debate on credentials and plat
form. Time is the only intervening ele
ment. The Parker managers have the
votes and can nominate on the first
ballot They desire to make the nomi
nation to-morrow, so as to have a night
conference over second place on the
ticket They cannot make definite
plans, because they cannot control the
debate, if there should be minority re
ports on credentials and platform.
Charles Walsh of Iowa, secretary of
the National Committee, as permanent
secretary of the convention. All other
officers of the temporary organization
wtre made permanent and the commit
tee adjourned under the impression
that its labors were ended.
When Senator Bailey was informed
of his election he announced at once
that he could not accept as he desired
to be on the noor when the platform
was under discussion. He is expected
to combat any attempt from the Bryan
forces to inject into the platform
planks which do not meet the approval
of the committee.
Senator Bailey argued that the chair
manship should be given to Clark and
a committee called upon Clark at the
Southern Hotel and made the tender.
Clark answered that he was engaged to
put the name of Senator Cockrell In
nomination for the Presidency and
therefore would have to be on the floor
during the convention. He was. urged
tc reconsider and finally agreed to send
a telegram to Senator , Cockrell. If
Senator Cockrell makes no objection he
will accept; 'It* is believed that Cockrell

bring relief to the entire country in
the shape of Democratic administra
tion, which would be in great contrast
to the uncertainty of the present ad
ministration. His remarks were re
ceived w4th cheers.
The suggestion having been mads
that the committee should take a re
cess .until 7 o'clock, Bryan suggested
that If there were any members of thÂ«
committee who had drafted platforms
which they desired to present they
should submit copies to the members
of the full committee In order that they
might have time to consider them be
fore coming together again.
"If.", said Chairman Daniel, "the
gentleman from Nebraska has a plat
form I should be very glad Indeed to
have a" copy of it."
Bryan replied that he had none.
At this juncture a number of mem
bers said that they had formulated
various resolutions which they desired
to submit, among them being Williams

her declared destination.
Members of the Cabinet. Elder States

"At 4 o'clock on the morning of July
4 a few Russians approached near our
pickets posted one and one-half miles
northwest of Motien Pass. They were
followed immediately by one company
which attacked. Then from the north
ern heights the enemy, brought down
another company, thus surrounding us.
"The picket commander dispatched
his main force toward the southern
hills, retaining only a small force. Our
troops were fiercely engaged in a close
encounter with the enemy and forced
a passage through the Russian line,
while our outposts which had been the
first alarmed attacked the enemy's
Hank. A desperate fight ensued which
resulted in the enemy retiring, pursued
by our main outposts, to Chenchia
Paotze and Tawan.
"The enemy also attacked our out
posts west of Shiakaolln at about the

In the meantime the Japanese will

vels at the lack of decision on the
part of Generals Kuroki and Oku,
expressing the belief that this may
account for the farct that the forces

PORT ARTHUR, July 3. 9 p. m., via
Tientsin, July 6.â Four Japanese tor
pedo-bc-at destroyers which made a de
termined attempt to enter. Port Ar
thur were discovered by the shore bat
teries. One was sunk under Golden
Hill and-.-another under. Twenty-two
Battery. Another had Its funnel shot
away and the fourth retreated.
The spirits of the men composing the
garrison are excellent and food is
plentiful. . .. ..
On Saturday fifty Japanese spies
were captured at a place the name of
which is not given.
Trains are running in both directions
for a distance of sixteen miles from
Port Arthur. ' " â¢
It was announced from Tokio, July 3,
that a belated report . from Admiral'
Togo recorded a desperate and suc
cessful torpedo attack at the entrance
of Port Arthur during the night of
June 27, in which a Russian guardship
and a Russian torpedo-boat destroyer
were sunk.
The exact date of the attack is not
ascertained, but it is said to have oc
curred Saturday. No further details
are obtainable. Though it is believed
other destroyers participated in the at
tack, only four succeeded in getting in.
The method whereby this information
reached the authorities is not disclosed.
The reckless bravery of the Japan
ese in going to almost certain destruc
tion excites nothing but admiration
here. The channel at Port Arthur is
so strewn with wrecks that evidently
it was regarded as unnecessary to use
a boom. On account of the difficulty
of getting into the harbor the feat
is considered in naval circles to be fully
as daring as that of the Japanese at
Weihaiwei, where Japanese torpedo
boats, in a storm and covered with ice.
were Jumped over the booms protect
ing the harbor and desttoyed the Chi
nese warships. So far as known the
Japanese torpedo-boat destroyers did
not even succeed in launching tprpe
doc-s.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 6, 1:30 p. m.
A few nights ago Admiral Togo at
tempted to repeat the Japanese exploit
with torpedo-boats at Weihaiwei dur
ing the Chinese-Japanese war by send
ing torpedo-boat destroyers into the
harbor of Port Arthur for the purpose
of sinking ships at their anchorage,
but the attempt ended in disastrous
failure. Four torpedo-boat destroyers
succeeded in creeping into the harbor,
which was not protected by booms, but
only one escaped. Two were sunk by
the shore batteries and one was crip
pled.

These cases are not in line with that
of General Hawley, for he is to be suc

so, all save Senator Stewart, who is
likely to be succeeded by some other.
In this list are two others, Senators
Aldrich of Rhode Island and Hale ol
Maine, who have been in the Senate as
long as General Hawleyâ twenty-three
years â but not any who antedate him.
But there are others â one of whom has

Quay. Senator Dick, serving out the
term of the late Senator Hanna, ranks

The winning of New York will be left
to the Republican organization of that
State with Chairman and Governor
Odell at its head, as was done four
years ago. Strong effort will be made
in West Virginia and New Jersey to
meet and offset the attacks to be made
in those States by the Democrats. Be
cause of the Democratic tiopes that
have been raised In Wisconsin and Illi
nois by Republican dissension the na
tional committee will give special at
tention to those States. Fairbanks'
power and popularity will do much to
make Indiana certain, but still some
attention will be paid to that State.
The Mormon question being prosecuted
by a Republican Congress gives some
slight anxiety that might not other
wise be felt concerning Utah and Idaho
and will call for some missionary work
there. Labor troubles in Colorado will
also provoke a more than ordinarily^
warm contest in that State. The State
Legislature, as well as the national
ticket, is the concern of the contest in
Nebraska, for there- a United States
Senator is to be chosen to succeed Sen
ator Dietrich next winter, and it Is not
denied that the ambitions of Mr.
Bryan in that direction shall be ful
filled. This Is an outline of the direction
to be taken by the labors of Chairman
Cortelyou and the national committee,
but that the result in any of the West
ern States, especially, is a matter of
real anxiety to the campaign managers
Is not suggested.
Democrats, as evidenced in the ses
sions of the .legislative campaign com
mittee of which Representative Cow
herd is chairman and which has been
actively at work here for weeks, base
consideration. For the addressing of
envelopes, the mailing of tons of liter
ature, the keeping of accounts, the in
finite detail that attends the conduct
of a national campaign an army of
small salaried clerks is needful and the
number of volunteers would indicate
a patriotism most cheering. Thera will
be a few in a number ranging ud to
500 who will earn as much as $20 a
week, but these are the captains. The
rank and file will draw down about $10.
The enlistments will not be made for
some time, however.
Campaign material is in the mean
time being turned out in quantity.ln the

Secretary Cortelyou has established
his temporary headquarters as chair
man of the national committee at the
Arlington Hotel, which was the home
of the late Senator Hanna, his pre
decessor. Secretary Dover will remain
here continuously until about August
1, when the headquarters will be set
up in New York. In the meantime the
members of the executive committee,
not necessarily members of ihe national
committee and provided for by the
initial meeting in Chicago will be
named. The announcement will follow
a brief vacation, during which Mr.
Cortelyou will presumably be out of
dally touch with newspaper men.
The vacation is probably suggested
by the flood of applications for small
Jobs that long since set in and which
now threatens to crowd out tvery other
CORTELYOU'S QUARTERS.
The total number of the seats in the
big hall Is 10,804. Of these 2000 go to
the 2000 delegates and alternatesâ 2012
if Porto Rico and the Philippines are
allowed the six seats each they want.
There are 87 .boxes with 420 chairs,
tickets for which go to members of the
national committee and distinguished
Democrats. The national committee
will also distribute tickets to distin
guished guests for 604 chairs in the
arena. There are 2288 chairs in the
gallery. The Business Men's League
of St. Louis have 2000 tickets in recog
nition of their effort and money in
bringing the convention to the city.
The delegates have three seats for dis
tribution besides their own. On the
stage for still other guests are 434 seats.
Mr. Mann has on file 960 applications
for the 702 seats. Of these 584 are
from 348 daily newspapers, 330 from as
many weeklies, 40 from six press as
sociations and 6" from as many indi
viduals who sign themselves "special
correspondents." Among these last are
Joe Howard Jr. of New York, Frank
Carpenter of this city and Charles M.
Pepper of Chicago â three of the six who
are well known under that head. The
task of the committee will be to scale
down the applications. In some cases
this will be comparatively easy, as, for
instance, in that of one New York
newspaper that asked for sixteen seats.
The press seats are divided into two
sections, one for the active newspaper
men who will grind out their copy in
the face of the convention and as its
work proceeds, the other for those who
make notes or who write their impres
sions later. *
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, July 6.â Charles II.
Mann, who for twenty-five years has
had charge of the press gallery of the
House of Representatives, has been
employed since the adjournment of
Congress in receiving, answering and
tabulating the applications of news
papers and newspaper men for seats at
the Democratic National Convention
at St. Louis. Mr. Mann has performed
this work several times before and has
reduced it to a system. He keeps a
record of the applications^ and notes
the character, politics and circulation
of every paper, so that those who un
dertake to apportion the seats will
have all the information necessary to
guide them under their eye when he
turns over the books. To the press the
general committee has assigned 702
seats. The sub-committee of the
national committee having charge
of the distribution of these seats
is composed of Norman E. Mack
of New York, Daniel J. Campau of

VICTORY FOB PARKER,
there were cries of "This is a white
man's country." . So great did the
noise become that the sergeant at
arms went down into the hall and
ordered the aisles cleared. But the
police had difficulty in carrying out
these instructions. Mr.. Williams had
been speaking an hour and twenty
minutes.
"Now, a few words in conclusion."
%aid Mr. Williams, "and if you are as
pleased to hear that conclusion as I am
to conclude, this will' be the most de
lighted audience that ever existed."
Mr. WilliAms spoke but a few words
more and concluded his address greatly
exhausted. v The perspiration was
j streaming from his face, his collar was

j worn to a frazzle, and could not be

as he finished his speech. ;
As he finished after speaking for one
hour and forty minutes, the band
struck up a melody of patriotic airs
the stirring strains of "Dixie" calling
forth the wild cheers that never fall
to follow the song no matter where or
when rendered.
"The delegates are invited to visit
the exposition," said Mr. Williams
"and the clerk will read the invitation/'
BRYAN IS SILENT.
The last few words were lost in cries
of "Bryan, Bryan." that came swift
and thick from different parts of the
hall. Cheers mingled with the calls
and it was fully a minute before the
voice of the clerk was able to rise
above the tumult. Mr. Bryan remained
quietly In his seat during the demon
stration made by his friends and gave
no outward sign of his recognition of
the applause that had greeted his
name.
Delegate Powers of Michigan was
recognized by Chairman Williams to
return the thanks of the* convention to
the exposition for the courtesy shown
and made a brief speech of acknowl
edgment. The motion to accept the in
vitation when, Mr. Powers concluded
was'adopted unanimously.
,' Sergeants at arms delivered bundles
of exposition tickets to the chairmen of
the delegations. When the ticket pass-
ers had nearly finished their task the
chairman announced that the roll of
States would be called, each State as
its \ name was called to send up to the
chairman's desk the names of Its com
mltteemen elected in caucus.
While the roll call was in progress,
the spectators, concluding that the
spectacular scenes of the convention
were over for the day. streamed out
by thousands. The noise of their exit
and the talking throughout the hall
was so general that the clerks could
be heard with great difficulty. The
announcement of Mr. Bryan as a mem
ber of the resolutions committee from
Nebraska called forth a cheer.
David B. Hill's name as a member
from New York also brought applause,
After announcing time and places for
the various committee meetings, a mo
tion was made by Bourke Cockran that
the convention adjourn until 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning. The motion was
adopted and the convention adjourned
at 2:50 o'clock.
The way to Parker's nomination on
the first ballot has been cleared and
the plan made. While the Hearst men
are still claiming that they have
pledges from more than 400 delegates
not to vote or Parker, the managers of
Parker claim to have more than 700
votes pledged to his nomination on any
ballot desired. V
Somebody is mistaken In the count.
The burden of proof ia on the protest
ants. The States on which they have
relied are slipping away from them.
Maryland and Michigan deserted them.

ministration had snubbed the first,
tried to disgrace the second and in
sulted the third, and the convention
again broke out into shouts and ap
plause. By this time Mr. Williams'
voice was failing. It grew weaker and
he was heard with difficulty, even by
those near the platform. .
Mr. Williams' flow of oratory was
uninterrupted for some time. A re
sponse of applause followed his de
nunciation of the Republican claims
of prosperity because of the tariff.
NOISE REIGNS SUPREME.
Cries of "Louder" were again
heard in various parts of the hall.
"I wish I had the lungs to speak
louder, but I cannot," Mr. Williams
answered. : J. -'ir.1
"What did you say?" came a voice
from the gallery. '
. ; So rapidly did the noise increase
that Mr. Williams began to address
himself directly to the persons on the
platform. This brought forth from
the galleries loud cries ~of "Time", and
''Louder." .^

had left* turned to the audience arid

who died ninety-three years ago, left
a fortune which has acumulated to the
amount of Â£300,000. and that his share

The old shoemaker does not expect
to sit cross-legged and peg away much
longer. Major Sinclair was a member
of a well-known family at Wick. He
entered the army at an early age and
went to India. He was killed in a
small engagement and his estate waa
never claimed. An Edinburgh firm of
lawyers has made Investigations and
located the lawful heirs to the im

night, closely following Pennsylvania's
declaration for the New York jurist,

played by other delegations which had
been counted in the anti-Parker ranks
had a telling effect upon the opposition.
Though the opponents professed not to
be disheartened by stories of Parker
gains and continued to claim that more
than one-third of the delegates had
pledged themselves never to vote for

who are willing to listen to those who
were backing the field against the fa

he was interrupted time and again by
laughter. ?
Cheering was evoked by the speak
er's statement that Mr. Roosevelt had
found praise for only three Presidents,
"George Washington, Abraham Lincoln
and himself," and when he asked if the
"Hell-roaring Jake" Smith order was
a sample of the moral sentiment for
which the Republicans stood a lusty
cheer, broke forth. Â¦ . Â¦â¢
CONVERSATION HUMS.
A great part of Mr. Williams' speech
was delivered under great difficulties,
for the speaker and those of his hear
ers who were supposed to be most di
rectly interested in his remarks. The
aisles leading past the delegates were
packed by dense throngs, who kept
up a constant hum of conversation that
smothered Mr. Williams' voice. Po
licemen who were stationed in this
space around the platform to keep
others away did it by occupying the
space themselves to the exclusion of -all
others. Several' times the speaker
stopped and asked that the talking
cease, in order that he might make
himself better understood.
i Passing from the discussion of Mr.
j Root's speech, the speaker took up the
i Republican platform.
Mr. Williams drew a picture of the
country's condition at the' time of
President Cleveland's first inaugura
tion, declaring that much of the dis
tress that came in the early nineties
was due to Republican misrule that
had gone before, under Benjamin Har
rison. He said for three years all hope
| had well nigh vanished from the bus
iness world. He scored the attitude of
the Republican party on the financial
question, declaring that it had been
full of inconsistencies Â«and absurdities.
He mentioned the name of Mr. Bryan
in discussing the price of wheat dur
ing the. first Bryan-McKinley cam
paign. The utterances of the speaker
caused a little applause and some
cheers.' A second later he Mentioned
the name again and the. applause was
not repeated.
A mention of the name of Grover
Cleveland was cheered lustily, a mo
ment later the first scene of the ses
sion occurred. Mr. .Williams declaring
that it was brazen effrontery for the
Republican party to attempt to seize
the laurels of Grover Cleveland. ' A
great outburst of applause followed,
cheer after cheer was heard in the hall
and although the chairman used the
gavel vigorously the convention was
soon beyond his control.
/New Hampshire delegates climbed
upon their seats and yelled vigorously.
One Iowa man of the Hearst delegation
from that commonwealth stood up and
waved his hat frantically and a wild
chorus answered him.
CLEVELAND'S NAME CHEERED.
"Three cheers for Grover Cleveland,"
shouted an Alabama delegate, and they
came with genuine power and en
thusiasm. No cry came from Ne
braska, where Mr. Bryan and his
friends sat quietly without taking part
In the demonstration. Again and again
the cheers came in dense volume,
despite numerous cries of "Order, or
der," and the ponderous pounding of
the chairman's gavel.
Then Mr. Williams stood back and
watched the scene he had created. As
the cheers and cries fell there were
renewed cries and the demonstration
lasted eight minutes.

Angeles County Central Committee.
"Again we recalled to Mr. Tarpey
the fact that in his fight for control
of, the State Central Committee we
immediately heeded his appeal for
proxies and placed In his hands the
proxy of every Los Angeles man that
could not be present on the day the
issue was decided. We also recalled
to him the fact that, prior to the vote
on the instruction resolution In the
Santa Cruz convention, McNab called
upon us and his offers would have won
over any less loyal men. Mr. Garner,
who stands here, and the rest of the
southern delegates will bear me out."
Mr. Garner nodded in affirmation and
McCarthy continued:
Not a cent will they pay, they say.
Tarpey is angry, clear through. He
has said nothing yet, but all are stand
ing clear of the magazine of his wrath
In interested anticipation.
"Let me give you some history." said
J. Harvey McCarthy to-day. "It was
Tom McCaffery and I that met Tarpey
in Los. Angeles when he went to line
up the southern delegation In favor of
instmctions for Hearst. Without Mc-
Caffery, who is my best friend (I will
say nothing of my own achievements),
the pro-Hearst resolution in the Santa
Cruz convention would have, been de
feated. It was McCaffery alone that in
fluenced the San Diego delegation to
stand behind Tarpey in his battle.
''Not only did I have tfie support of
the entire southern delegation in my
ambition to secure appointment on
some 'honorable committee, but I
brought here with me a letter from

especial desire that my request be

The turning-down of the delegates
that came from south of Tehachapi in
their fight for representation on com
mittees, particularly J. Harvey Mc-
Carthy, has made and will make more
Democratic history in California. An
gered beyond reconciliation by what
they brand as Tarpey's ingratitude, the
south of Tehachapi delegates met to
day and repudiated the assessment res
olution, which required that each dele
gate contribute $75, and each alternate
$50 toward the expense fund.
Those that put themselves on record
were Martin C. Marsh, J. Harvey Mc-
Carthy, Joseph Simons and Martin

all the honors, let it pay for the inci

the chromos, for the draperies, the
bunting, the servants, and the service."
RISE OF THE TARPEY IRE.
The action of the California dele
gation in repudiating: Tarpey's de
mand is fraught with significance.
Tarpey makes the claim that from
first to last the Hearst and affiliated
forces can hold 400 votes away from
Parker. California must now be elim
inated from his calculations, for
should Hearst withdraw from the
fight, as it is believed he will after the
first ballot, the Californians may scat
ter where they will. Nothing remains
to hold them to the radicals. Tarpey
is taking on a worried, tired look in
consequence.

Tarpey stormed^ and argued. Some
yielded to hig desire, but when it came
to a vote Tarpey met defeat and the
rebelling wing of the delegation had
won its first victory. Tarpey has been
stripped of the power to tie them to

effort to delay the nomination of a

HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION, ST. LOUIS, July 6.â
Though Its little cry died the hour of
its birth, the California delegation'3
entry into the convention hall to-day
was triumphant. But its triumph was
not won on the floor of the Coliseum;
its significance was not political. It
was the tribute of the guests In the
balcony and the gallery to the Califor
nia wines and fruits they had tasted at
headquarters and their, expression of
belief in the tales of .the flowers and
sunshine of the farthest West.
But the wines cannot drown nor the
sunshine dissipate the woes of the del
egation. Prior to the march to the
convention hall this morning another
merry row forced wider the breach be
tween the warring delegates, ' and
Chairman Tarpey met his first decisive
defeat since the delegation left the
West. Tarpey demanded that the del
egation adopt the unit rule. In this
many of the delegates saw a scheme to
trade them like chattels after Hearst
has been eliminated from the fight.
Under instructions the delegation is a
unit for Hearst, but the tie binds them
no farther.
BY FREDERIC W. BISTIOP
Staff Correspondent of The Call.
ST. LOT'IS, July 6.â The Democratic
Nrticnal Convention convened here to
day in the Exposition building. This
mor.ster meeting place, within the walls
of which Democracy's standard bear
ers are to be named, was the Mecca
for all whose interest here centers in
the convention. The scenes of activity
have been transferred from the hotels
to this one common point. The corri
dors of the former, wherein for sev
eral days past all has been excitement,
vcre deserted soon after the morning
hours.
Long before the donrs were swung
open vast crowds thronged the streets
in the vicinity of the main entrance.
In the surging line were men and
women and visiting political organiza
tions eagerly seeking entrance. Those
vher have charge of the distribution
of the tickets for admission have been
deluged with requests for them, but. as
cards have been provided only To the
extent of the seating: capacity of the
haH, many persons were disappointed.
The preliminary skirmishes have
taken place and the big contest for the
Domination for President is now cm in
earnest. The decoration of the con
vention hall was "undertaken on a most
elaborate scale and the pleasing and
effective color scheme has been carried
out to the minutest details. The great
dome ceiling, which rises high above
the floor, is covered with a fabric of
solid yellow, with here and there
flounces of a fvhite material carrying
out the architectural design. Within
"each of the sections of the ceiling is
the star of one of the States and a
Ftnnd of ci.-lors, while the front of the
pallery spaces are festooned with white
cloth. The walls are adorned with the
rational emblem, forming a frame for
the colossal color picture overhead. The
Eplendor of the various colored gowns
worn by the large number of ladies
occupying seats in the" galleries gave
the finishing touch and completed a j
scene both spectacular and picturesque. ;
"With the exception of bouquets on the
tables of the chairmen, plants were
"rot in evidence. The hall is an im
mense amphitheater. The accommo- ,
datior.s for the general public, and es
pecially for the press, are much more j
complete than they w?re at the Chi- j
cago convention and the best for the j
latter that have ever been provided at j
a national convention, every facility 1
for the reporting of the proceedings j
end the prompt dispatch of news to !
the world at large being afforded.
SEATING ARRANGEMENTS.
The participants in the convention j
proceedings occupy positions on the \
main .floor, which forms an ellipse, the j
chairman's platform, with ample seat- i
ing capacity, rising at the center in the !
rear. The section allotted to the dele- ]
grates is directly in front of this plat
form. A large standard â a red, white i
and blue diskâ designates the location j
of the vari-jus delegations by States Â¦
and incidentally adds to the attractive- j
iiess of the spectacle. 'â¢
On either side of the delegates' posi- j
tion provision has been made for the j
alternates, the press peats being lo
cated on the immediate sides of the
chairman's platform.
Directly opposite the platform and in
the rear of the delegates is a stand,
where a band of thirty pieces played
throughout the convention, filling in
the gaps with stirring music.
The galleries encircle the ellipse, the
seats riFing in tiers. Seats on the plat
form and one section of the gallery
immediately in Its rear are reserved
for Governors, members of Congress.
Mayors of cities and others of distin
tinguishr-d prominence In the party. A
hospital has been provided in the ante
rooms and is fully equipped with all
rr.edical stores and surgical appliances
snd with a corps of doctors and trained
nursrs.
Naturally, the opening speech of John
Sharp Williams of Mississippi, leader
of the minority on the floor of the Na
tional House of Representatives and
chosen by the Democratic National
Committee for temporary chairman,
â¢was awaited with keen interest, as he
had been delegated to sound the key
note of the campaign and as it was
known that he would deal with ques
tions which will be of vital Impor
tance in the coming struggle for party
supremacy.
A stream of visitors and a drizzle of
delegates were passing into the hall an
hour before the time set for the open
ing of the convention. The anxious
ones hurried to plant themselves in
their seats before any other person
ehould pre-empt them.
Even before one-tenth of *<Â» dele
pates had arrived the hall had become
uncomfortably warm. The windows]
which are on only one side, open but
half way and are on the level of the
top row of seats in the gallery Â¦
NEW YORK IN FRONT ROW. I
In drawing for seats Pennsylvania i
and Michigan were the fortunate ones, I
securing the locations directly in j
front of the speaker's stand. Two- I
thirds of the way back to the rear
was Nebraska. New York was i n j
the front row. Just to the left of j
Michigan. Indiana was directly be
hind New York, while Massachusetts J
fared the worst of any of the "great ;
States, being in the last row. By the |
time the hall was one-third full the j
heat be~an to increase to a noticeable j
degree. The auditorium from the j
speaker's stand was one flutter as the '
palmk-af fans bobbed back and forth, j
The delegates lost but UtUe time In '
;. doffing their coats. With the excep
Â¦ tion of the temperature, which was a
'serious drawback to the illusion, the
! effect was not unlike. a slow snowfall
! gradually whitening, the surface of the
j ground.
The nr.Â°t . ripple of applause that
i went across the convention hall came
I from the galleries when the Texas del
egation marched in bearing the flag
of red, white and blue, with the single
star. A white silk banner bearing the
i inscription "Florida Democracy Safe
i and Sound" was borne into the hall
j shortly after Texas had arrived and
I was also greeted with applause. This
j was live minutes before 12, and up to
I that time not a hand clap had been
i offered to any man who had entered
! the hall. The platform .was crowded
with members of'the National Com
| mittee. But the crowd paid no atten
i tion to them. The Philippine delega
j tion came in with their banner, which
was uot floating free like those which"
had entered before it. It was an
j American fiv.g of silk wrapped closely
I around the staff and tied hard and fast.
(This was done, according to one of the
; Philippine delegation, "with deliberate
j intent," as if to show that the Dem
, ocratic convention did not recoznize
: the Philippines as a part of the nation.
Chairman Guffey ""of Pennsylvania
j strode in closely behind the Philip
i pine Slag and was heartily cheered.
Not a note of music was heard in
1 the hall during the long wait between
{ the opening of the doors and the fall
J of the gavel. The concert which
; usually enlivens the prelude was ab
! sent and it was just before noon that
a band marched into the gallery just
! opposite the platform. Its leader sev
| eral times flourished his baton to
! strike up a tune, but the energy of
: Chairman Jones in expediting the pro
i ceedings left no place for the band.
HARD TO GET ORDER.
Exactly at noon Chairman J. K.
J -Tries of the National Committee called
the Democratic convention to order.
] His appearance on the platform and
i the sound of his gavel brought forth' a
Â¦ cheer f roni the floor and gulleries.
Chairman Jones directed the ser
: geant at arms to procure order. He
! continued rapping: the table with his
i gavel, but It was some time before
' quiet reigned. California's appearance
; with a huge silken banner and silk
i American flag and a yell, "California,
! California:" "Hearst, Hearst, Hearst!"
1 caused cheering. Just as the Califor
; nia delegation reached its reservation
I after marching up and down the cen
i ter aisle William Jennings Bryan, who
j had come in unnoticed, arose in his
place and was given a cheer. ! Then
| an enterprising member of the Mon-
I tana delegation created a diversion by
! vigorously ringing a cowbell.
Again Chairman Jones demanded
; that the convention be in order and at
i once directed the secretary to read the
, call for the convention. Applause fol
! lowed the reading of the call. After
| quiet was restored Chairman Jones an
j nounced that the convention would be
j opend by prayer by Rev. John E. Can-
I non, pastor of the Grand-avenue Bap
! tist Church of St. Louis.
The prayer was as follows:
Almighty God. our Father which art In
h+avÂ«?n. in all cur ways we would acknowledge
tho<? in <jrd.Â»r that thou mayest direct our
paths. 'We bow oursel% - es In thy presence and

Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
During the invocation the convention
stood. Dr. Cannon's voice was entirely
Inadequate to reach even to the center
of the hall. The prayer occupied sev
eral minutes.
WILLIAMS TAKES CHAIK.
. Enthusiastic cheering greeted the
chairman's announcement that he was
directed by the National Committee to j
appoint John Sharp Williams tempo- !
rary chairman, C. A. Walsh temporary
secretary and John T. Martin tempo

r The chair appointed Colonel John M.

4THE SAN FRANCISGO CALL,. THURSDAY, JULY 7, 190*.
Continued on Pase 0, Column 1,
A greater- falsehood waa never uttered than
that wheat went . up "because McKinley was
elected." Things bad struck rockbottom and
Do not misunderstand me. A panic, of
course, la not succeeded all at once by the
golden hues of prosperity. Industrial depres
sion must follow it for a while, as depression
must precede it. So depression continued until
when? As I have said, when the. boll bursts
and t h? poison Is eliminated from the body
commercial the flesh begins to heal. It can
not begin to heal one minute earlier. The
process of recovery was aided ,by many, for
us, fortuitous circumstances. The first of these
was famine in India â no Indian wheat to com
pete ln the European markets with
our?. Simultaneously with an Immense
American crop of wheat and small
crops elsewhere, wheat rose from about 48
cents to about 70 rents In a few weeks during
the Bryan-McKtnley campaign, while Cleve
land was yet President. There is not a man
within the sound of my voice that does not
remember that. With 70-eent wheat farmers
could pay the retailers' debts due them; and
the retailers could buy more goods; the-re
tailers with empty shelves or shelves becom
ing empty by sales could order from the Job
bers: the Jobbers, who had been overstocked,
were enabled then to order from the factories.
When the factories got orders then they had
a reason for making goods and they proceeded
to make them, and then the wheels of indus
try went round. The farmer in the wheat
country with 70-cent wheat could pay the
"baker, the butcher and the candlestick-mak
er," ar.d then they ccuid pay others and they
in tvrn could buy mere goods. This endless
chain of human relationship In the world of
commerce is no mysterious thing to anybody
except the platform making politician.
But wheat going up had another effect.
When wheat went up during the campaign,
while Mlver bullion went down, there was
furnished a seeming object lesson of the In
accuracy of the contention of Mr. Bryan and
his followers, of whom I was one, that therÂ»
was necessarily a connection ln price between'
the two. Western and border State farmers
In the wheat belt, who had originally been
Republicans anyhow, and who had gone off
from the Republican party because* of their
belief in this very theory, began to leave tho
Bryan column and Join the McKinley column,
first by the doren. then by the score then
by the hundreds and then in shoals. Thus it
came about that Mr. McKinley was elected
because wheat went up and because the going
up of. wheat and the consequent Increased de
mand for ' . other ~- things, leading to â¢ higher
prices and a better volume of trade, promised
to their ntlnds prosperity without free silver.
GREAT INCREASE OF GOLD.
I waa not one of those who thought the
legislation adopted wise, but. wine or other
wise, the result Is an accomplished fact, plain,
palpable and obvious to ail men who have
common sense, and, like many another step
in history, it Is beyond recall. This accom
plished fact was the accomplished fact of a
gold basis then, not by the Republican party,
but by the dogged persistency and Indomitable
will of Grover Cleveland, aided, it Is true,. by
Republican legislators, who thought they saw
In it the final disruption of the Democratic
party. That was in the main their motive.
Ntfw they would "steal his thunder" and this
Republican platform boasts that It was the
Republican party which established the gold
basis. Moreover,' they would now eat their
words and their votes of 1803 and tell us
that th? panic was not brought about as they
then said, by "lack of confidence in our money
and too much silver," but, forsooth, by a
tariff act which was not passed until more
than a year after, to wit, in 180+, when the
panic â that is. the acute and fright stage cf
depression â was virtually over.
repeal of the purchasing clause of the Sher
man act.. This ncstrum was suggested by wise
men and it was administered to the patient.
It did no good, of course. The panic went on;
went on until when? Until the boll upon the
body commercial having burst, the i-oison of
speculation, boom 'values and credit operations
were released from the system. It went on
until agriculture, the basic Industry, revived.
In the midst of the panic all tho wise men,
and chief among them the Republican leaders,
told us It was the lack of confidence In the
money of the country that had brought on the
panic. Tho Democratic administration with a
sufficient number of votes of both parties in
the two houses beyond it took that view of
the situation and demanded and secured the
passage of the act repealing the purchasing
clause cf the Sherman act. thereby, for the
first time, practically establishing the gold
standard In tho United States. Without either
free or limited coinage of standard silver
money, tho cc.intry was. Immediately after

had begun to revive before McKinley was
â¢ elected, and the first Infallible test of that
fact was the rise ln the price of wheat, fol
lowed by the rise of other agricultural pro
ducts. Then came the immense Increase of j
gold that kept prices up here and elsewhere. I
Xot only Is the bonst that Mr. MoKinley's elec
tion was responsible for high prices not true,
but It ls a very dangerous falsehood. The
Populists" first told the people ln certain sec
tions of this country that prosperity waa chiefly
dependent on government. Some men nreacn
the doctrine with the hope that during periods
of prosperity the average man. will let even
the extravagant, dishonest and unjust govern
ment in which he is Interested continue unin
terrupted. This .is the enter, lf net the whole,
hope of the Republican party to-day. Let the
Republican party beware, and let all men who
lovo thotr country beware of carrying this
'doctrine of government-created prosperity any
farther. If th? idea is one firmly Imbedded
In the human mind there will be no saving
its teacher from the wrath to come â State
socialism.
I quote again from thÂ« platform:
"We refused to palter longer with the
miseries of Cuba and declared war agrftnst I
Spain." >
Bad history egaln! Democrats demanded i
the recognition of belligerent rights and Inde
pendence for Cuba Cay in and day out. The
Republican Speaker constantly refused thÂ»m
even so much as a parliamentary recognition.
Tho Republican President was thoroughly out
of sympathy with their wishes. Finally treach
ery and cruelty unprecedented led to the blow-
Ing up of the Maine and her crew. Public
opinion would no longer bn restrained â "Re
member the Maine," becamo the battle cry.
It was net "the miseries of Cuba" at all that
led the Republican party to fall into line with
public demand and fight Spain. Hearing the
echo of that cry "Remember the Maine," and
amid the universal excitement and anger, the
Republican Speaker and the President both
stood out of the way, as well they might, and
the former advised Intervention. It Is un
patriotic to pretend that even this, long de
layed as it wnsÂ», was in any proper sense a
Republican measure. Democrats voted for it
as fully as Republicans. They did this and
voted for the act of Intervention, not because
It was a Republican President or'a Republican
measure, but because the American Govern
ment was at least pursuing an American policy
â a policy which had always been Democratic.
Then the platform adds these words: "We
fought a quick, victorious war with Spain."
Bad history again!
Americans fought It. It would be invidious
to state the politics of heroes, but It seems to
me that I have heard it said that Dewey .was
a Democrat, that Pchley was a Democrat,
that Miles' was a Democrat, and it seems to
me, toa. that 1 have heard that a Republican
administration snubbed the first, tried to dis
grace the second and insulted the third. It
seems, too, that I have heard from men on
the fighting line that Joe ' WhÂ«eler was as
much In evidence as the President himself.
It eeems to me that I have heard that Hobson
was a Democrat. It seems to me. too, that
I have heard that young Bagley of. North Caro
lina, the first offering of the war upon the
altar of a- common country, was a Democrat.
I quote from the platform again: "We set
Cuba free."
Bad history once more. But for the Demo
i cratlo Senators and Representatives demanding
and voting for a proviso to the act of inter
vention, to the effect that the people of Cuba
"were and of right ought to be free and Inde
pendent" and pledging our faith that we would
wage no "war pf conquest or territorial ac
quisition, but would withdraw our troops after
pacification." the Republican administration
would doubtless be furnishing to the world to
day ln the case of Cuba a companion piece to
the picture which has been exhibited In the
Philippines.
' OX THE TRUST QUESTION'.
Let us ere what the Republicans have to
say for themselves In connection with the
great trust question. This Is the language of
the platform:
"Laws enacted by the Republican party and
which the Democratic party failed to enforce,
have been fearlessly enforced."
Here are three statements â First. That the
Republicans', instead of both parties, enacted
the laws, which ls not true; second, that the
Democratic party had done nothing; and, third
that the Republican party has enforced the
law. which Is only partially true.
Now. the fact Is that, although the Demo
crats only had a four-year opportunity, and
although the trust evil was neither very acute
nor very prevalent at that time, Attorney-
General Harmon, under the Cleveland adminls- '
tratlon. filed the suit for the Government '
agalst the Trans-MlB?ouri Freight Association,
took It up, revived it and won It. He then
instituted suit against the Joint Traffic Asso
ciation and also against the Addystone Pipe
Company. These two cases were decided Jor
the Government aftÂ«r Mr. Cleveland went out.
it ls true, but on the lines laid own by nls
Attorney -General. \
y.or iz it :rnÂ« In any proper sense that the
Republican party deserves much credit for en
forcing the anti-trust law. What has the Re
| publican party done ln th!s regard? One of
I the chairmen of the Republican convention
j (I, have forgotten whether It was the tempo
rary or permanent) says It has "enjoined the
beef trust."
We would not have known It if somebody
had not told us. The injunction does not eeem
to have had any practicnl effect upon the
â¢ beef trust or upon the price of beefsteak.
! I think It was the permanent chairman of
the Republican committee who said that the
Democrats killed trusts with wind, the Re
publicans with law.' Where are the corpses?
There ls but one that I know of, but it prop
erly belongs to Governor Van Sant. It is
the spoil* of his sword and his spear.
The boast that the administration has exe
cuted the anti-trust law Is, of course, ridicu
lous. The Attorney General, in response to a
resolution of my own. frankly confessed that
nothing had been done, and left the Inference
that nothing would be done toward the-crim
inal prosecution of .the men found guilty by
the Supreme Court In the Northern Securities
cas<! of having violated the law and incurred
its penalties. The entire Republican party

sentatives, with three exceptions. Voted against
a orovUo instructing the Secretary of thÂ» Navy
Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦:Â¦ â¢-- Â¦.- -.-Â¦. *. -Â¦;- .... -. - -
. I read from the platform again: "Tariff
rates should be radjusted only when conditions
have so changed that the public interests de
mands their alteration."..
, "Public interest" ln this connection, consid
ering the voice which" has uttered the words, ls
good. â¢ â¢ "Public Interest" from the men who
Vrote It and. the convention which adopted It.
really means '.'protected Interests." How can
public Interest "demand," the alteration? How
can it make the demand heard? There 1*
only one way that I know of to make a demand
cf this sort heard, and that Is to vote down
the men who say that all is "well enough"
and that' the gospel of humanity, as. far as
thÂ» tariff Is concerned, is all included in the
phrase "stand pot."/
Is it possible. 'that the American people can
be deceived by â¢ empty verbiage like that?
Does not everybody know that the Republican
party hns no idea of making any alterations
in the tariff, unless it can thereby purchase
the support of additional special interests, or
to tte those already bought by special Inter
ests by yet closer bonds?
Are there no "conditions" demanding any
changes ln any of the schedules of the present
tariff law. when dozens of highly protected
steel and Iron products, including rails, loco
motives, barbed wire and agricultural Imple
ments of American make are being sold daily
in competition with the so-called pauper labor
of the world in the* home of this run' paun^r
labor? Â¦ More than that, when they are being
carried right by the south door of Great
Britain -on through the straits of Gibraltar to
Great Britain's own colony of South Africa
â¢nd iol 1 there, \ and when, even more than
that, they aVc eold, after freight has been
paid and profit cbtained. at a less price than
the same things are sold to Americans in
American markets five miles from the factory?
Will any sane man say that "public Interest"
has not "demanded" some alterations ln the
tariff? The trouble is. and will be as long
as the Republicans are In power, that private
Interests won't allow~any.
The curious * thing about a man who ls ob
taining benefit*, by special legislation Is that
he insists upon playing two antagonistic roles.
One day he Is an Industrial baron, boasting
of . having . "conquered the markets of the
world" and of being able to keep them because
hie goods are better or cheaper. The next
day he Is "knocking at the doors of the com
mittee rooms of .the National Legislature, beg
ging a continuance cf protection against the
pauper labor of, the very market in which he
actually already veils his goods. What tort
of condition 1Â» it that will Justify public In
terest in demanding an alteration?
Suppose the following plank had been pre
sented to the Republican convention, does any
body- believe that It would have been adopted
namely: "Demanding a reduction of tariff
taxation' upcn. trust produced articles to the
point where foreign competition may enter the

REVISION OF THE TARIFF.
A more ridiculous piece of official Impotency
than ls the Interstate Commerce Commission
at present does not exist. It can declare a
Â«lven . rate of So cents, let us say. to h*Â»
unreasonable, but as it cannot prescribe what
would hs reasonable in its uteuri the railroad
can do' cne of two things: It can either take
an appeal, which suspends the decision of the
commlTftion while the appeal Is being long
draT^n out by the railroads Interested, or It
can change the rate to 49>4 cents, and when
that has bÂ»Â»pn declared unr^a-.-nnMc <"in
change it again to 40\J cents, and when that
has been declared- urrrasonable can change it to
4Q\(, cent* and so on ail Infiinltum. compelling
thÂ«! newly aggrieved citizen in each case to
bring suit, at the risk of being punished, in

"unfriendly conduct" and without the hope of
any suhslantl.il Immediate redress.
A bill to give the Interstate Commerce Com

not to ' fix a. schedule of rates for all the

where a rate has been declared unreasonable,
this rate to be maintained until eet sslde by
law. has been pending before the committee
on Interstate and foreign commerce in the
House of Representatives since this Congress

committee ag.iln and again demanded conaliÂ»Â»r

in answer to another resolution failed to show
thÂ«t anything substantial was being done

pretext that it would be "contrary to public

This same "trust buster," as my good friend,

are you going to do about It? What are you
going to do with the trust buster â "busted."
or removed, or .-. "promoted" out of the way?
Then there follows the beast of having "per
fected the interstate commerce law." The
absurdity of this statement ls demonstrated
by the actual condition of things. The Inter
state Commerce Commission has been knock
ing at thÂ« doors of Congress for years anking
for tr.ijrecred power, asking for this power
at least when a g;\en rate, after Investigation
and full iif-aring of both sides, has been de
cided by the commission to be unreasonable, to
declare what rate wculd be reasonable in its
stead, end to make this rate operative until
set aside by due process of law by appeal, re
view or otherwise.

The ex-Secretary then boasts that the Sec
retary of the Treasury can and does contract
and expand the country's currency at his
will, and illustrates this by the occurrences
which happened in ll>02. which he qnotcs. Re
member, he boasts that this is a fact. If bo.
what a magnificent one-man power it is. It
ls almost as great as that lately wielded by
the ex-Secretary himself, tihen he was ex
ofncio Emperor of the Philippine archipelago,
when, as he himself subsequently said ln a
public address, questions affecting the inter
ests and lives of millions of people had to be
decided by him upon not much more than a
moment's notice and entirely within his own
discretion. What do the men who believe
that the Government ought to go out of the
banking business and the men wbo believe
that the banks oufrht to ko out of the Gov
ernment business think of this remarkable. J
this boastful, assertion that one man ln the
I'r.ited States <an and does contract and ex

and bled of so many, at his sweet will? |
The temporary chairman told the country
that the act to expedite h^nrlngs of the trust

was "Republican lÂ»llslatlon." He. forgot to
say that every Democrat voted for It, and
that is my recollection.

rOLICY OF MeKIXLEY.
The ex- Secretary then tells us. In a burst
of eloquence, that "the fatal 14th of Septem
ber, 1901. marked no change of policy," that
when the kindly fraternal soul of McKinley
wended Its way from the earth he left bf-hlnd
him no break â his policy was continued |
in spirit by his successor. Who Is there In j
America of common aenÂ«e who does not know
better? The changed spirit of the policy of
the administration with regard to reciprocity
with foreign nations, with regard to local self
government in the South and ln twenty re
spects which It wtmld take too much time to
particularize will suggest themselves to your
mind at once.
Â¦ But to go en to the authoritative utterance
of the Republican platform In convention
assembled. The platform, like the temporary
chairmanship, deals definitely in the boast I
that the Republican party Is responsible for
everything good which has happened. It also
deals much ln ancient history. It did well to
go back fifty years ego. The present Republi
can par*y needs a running start of fully fifty
years to" enable the imagination of the people
to Jump ever Its present obstructlveness and
Its evasion of live issues which lie In the path
way. The platform, ln speaking of the access
of the Republican party to power after Mr.
Cleveland's second administration had expired,
uses this language:
"We then found the country, after four
years of Democratic rule. In evil plight, op
pressed with misfortunes and doubtful of the
future. Public credit had been lowered, rev
enues were declining, the debt was growing,
the administration's attitude toward Spain was
feeble and mortifying. Its standard of values
was threatened and uncertain. Labor was un
employed. Business was sunk In the depres
sion which succeeded the panic of 1803. Hope
was faint and confidence was gone." .
Suppose . I paraphrase that utterance by
saying that "when Mr. Cleveland succeeded
to the Presidency ln March. 1893, after four
years of Republican administration under Mr.
Harrison, the Democratic party found thÂ«
-country, after a long period of public misrule
and extravagance, ln : evil plight, oppressed
with misfortune and doubtful of the future.
Public credit had been lowered; the revenues
were declining."
The outgrowing administration was prepar
ing to Issue bonds. A Government deficit was
confessed. The panic which â¢ devastated the
world waÂ« relentlessly npprcaehlng our shores.
A long saturnalia of extravagance, public and
private, and of reckless' speculation had been
already followed by depression. Corn was
burned for fuel in Kansas and elsewhere ln
the West in 1890 and after. Cotton was at
or below the price of production. The acu.te
reaction which we call panic was Inevitably
approaching even before Mr. Cleveland was
elected.
"Business was sunk In the depression which
preceded the panic of ISO"?. Labor was unem
ployed or poorly remunerated ln factcry and
field, especially the latter." [
Indeed, business depression, especially In
agriculture, and the lack of adequate remune
ration for labor, taken together with the high
prices of manufactures under the McKinley
act. constituted the chief Industrial reason ln j
the public mind for turning Mr. Harrison nnd
the Republicans out and putting Mr. Cleveland
and the Democrats in. >.
To go on with the paraphrase, under Harri
son's administration for three vents "hope was
faint and confidence gone." The plight of the
people was so desperate that, like drowning
men, they were "catching at straws." Agra
rianlsm and socialism in the shape o* sub
treasury and other schemes were rife* from
1SW) and thence on.
"The two old parties," as they were called
were blamed for It all, but the one in power
was blamed moat, hence the outer power got in
Men advocating these nostrums in the state
of public deapertion then existing, counted
their audiences, throughout the suffering West
and depressed South, i no longer by numbers
but by the area. Who will deny the truth, the
historical truth, of a single Â¦ sentence of a
paraphrase? Why pretend to have . forgotten
all this? Why not be honest with the people
as men ought to be? . . r.--.'
It is true that after the election of Mr
Cleveland the chronic business depression con
tinued. It is true that it became acuteâ in
a wcrd reached the banks: and then the fright
or panic of 1893 came, which was not a local
or American condition, but one which had ex
isted from where Vienna nestles on the Danube
to where Buenos Ayres commands Us bay
one whose foundations had been laid long be
fore it reached us, almost the last among the
nations. '
Then, with the panic, upon us once more,
nostrums . of ' a~ national character were sug
gested to cuds an evil of world character. .One
of them, a* you will all remember, was the
uncertainty as to what competition from |
abroad they will be obliged to meet."
QUOTES ANOTHER SPEECH.
And I have heard that the President in his
political tour through the West In the spring
p. V.xx: made a speech In which he uaed this i
language : ;

fi S e p ' c !5 ! lrterest *o take ltÂ« lips from
the public breast for fear the public, finding

It Is not, therefore, to be wondered at that
the peroration of the "greatest of these" was
a sort of deification o f him wlio hsd rtubbrd
him grpatejt of these." It was almost as
natural as self appreciation. It was" only
aJter-egotism after all.

"The chief of these" l s Mr. Root. The
temporary chairman said, speaking of the
Republican party: "Through It more than
any other party, the moral sentiment o t the
American p*ople finds expression." God save

to flo with present Iniquities, anyhow? '
Mr. Root Â»aya: "Ofr-ndem have been re
lentlessly prosecuted and sternly punished "
Isn't this remarkable "thundering in the in
dex" for you. when compared with actual
Republican accomplishments, especially when
compared with the refusal of a Republican
House of Representatives to make culprits
face even to much as Congressional Investi
gation: when compared with the absolute and
constant refusal of the Republican Speaker
to recognize anybody for the purpose of mak
ing a motion even of that character? If
there ever was a determination fully enter
tained and finally carried out. It was the de
termination of the Republican administration
and the Republican legislative body to see
to It that nobody should Investigate the alleged
culprits In the Postoffice Department except
their colleague* In the executive branch of
the Government.
INCREASED CIRCULATION.
There follows something, however. wh!ch
will be taken weriously. The Secretary boasts
that the per capita of circulation of money
among the peonle ln the Unlfd States In
creased from $2.1 14 In March. 1807. to $.11 Cfl
In May last, and that the credit for that nnd
the consequent prosperity following It was
due to the Republican party. What a curious
boast this is for those lately denying so
strenuously that the quantity of money had
cnyihlng to do with the circulation of money
or the price of other things as measured ln
money, or with an ascending scale of pricea,
or with national prosperity. This was all de
nied but yesterday. Now It Is asserted that
the volume of metallic money has been Im
menBcly Increased; that It has brought pros
perity, and that it has all been due to Re
publican legislation.
Was Republican legislation operative In
South Africa and the Klondike, and did It
cause the discoveries of gold there? Did It
cause the new Inventions for the more profita
ble extraction of gold from gold ore? Did Re
publican legislation add $2,000,000,000 of i/old
to tie -world's f took of money metals !n tho
last eicht yearn? Was It Republican legisla
tion which made the Immense crops of cot
ton, Â¦wheat. â¢ corn. etc.. which ' enabled thÂ»
United States to draw more than their pro
rata share of the world's stock of money
metals, thereby Increasing their own stock of
gold by $700,000,000? .Wb-Â« partnership Is
this between God. human Industry and In
genuity and the Republican party, of which
the Renublican party claims to b- the self-as
sertive eenior member? What monumental ef
frontery is thin, which enables them to boast
of the benefits of the increased volume of
standard metallic money and consequent pros
perity by the operation of the "quantitative
theory of â¢ money. which theory they found
no language strong enough to deny and ridi
cule but yesterday?
Tbe temporary chairman next boasted that
the Republican party had by manipulation,
Â¦which he described, of the currency and. cer
tificate denomination made It so difficult to
get gold out of the Treasury, in exchange for
other forms of money, that practically it can
not be done at all to any largo extent and
hence that all danger of an endless chain,
thereby produced, baa ended. If so, U thla
ST. LOUIS. Ju!y â¬.â In his speech
to-day on assuming- his duty as tem
porary presiding cfiicer of the Demo
cratic national convention John Sharp
TViliiarr.s cf Mississippi, the gifted lead
er of the minority in the House of Rep
resentatives, sounded the keynote of
the campaigm for the party. His ut
terances give a comprehensive idea
of the policy of the "reorganized" De
mocracy, as shaped by the conserva
tives, who have returned to power for

form with the view of enabling thÂ« "Iowa
idea" men and the "Wisconsin idea" men to
go back home and say they have "gotten some
thing and thereby "save their faces," as the
Chinese say.
Who believes for a minute that the party
which has refused every tariff alteration thus
far proposed intends to recognize any sort of
"conditions" or any sort of "demands" or
any sort of "public interest" In connection,
with the question? Who does not know that
the only way public interest can, make any
demand for any alteration effective is by put
ting the Democratic party into power?

"Williams read an editorial from the
New York Times of June 29. entitled
"A Question of Facts," giving statis
tics to disprove the Republican plat
form's statement that "a Democratic
tariff has always been followed by bus
iness adversity, a Republican tariff by
business prosperity." Williams con
tinued:
nÂ«Â£ B TÂ£ r PV th " * uthor of th Â» *â¢Â»"Â»Â»Â»
torlan. This Is true, no matt-r which of th
tw o suspected parties be guilty cf it. the
President or Senator Lodge. The voice was
undoubtedly the voice of the Massachusetts
Jacob but the hand may have been the hand
of the Presidential Esau. But both knew thÂ»
facts. We are called upon In the Republican
platform "not to falter" in our allegiance to
protectionism when the only free trade coun
try ln the world is agitating a return to pro
tection. This has reference to Chamberlaini-ni
tn Great Britain. The author forgot to say
that what Is really belnsr agitated In Great
Britain Is retaliation against protectionist
countries by a proposed system of legislation
to contain as little protectionism aj is possi
ble. He also neglected to state that the move
ment has signally failed, and that U would
not have had a leg to stand on but for tha
enmity created in the minds of many British
subjects by our trade legislation. He a!so
neglected to say that the supreme evil of pro
tectionism is the excitation of this spirit of
enmity and commercial war.
Perhaps the richest piece of humor In th<Â»
Republican platform is where it is said: "We
have extended widely our foreign market."
and. ln another place. "We contjuererl rte-.Â»
markets and created a volume of exports which
far surpass Imagination." The "we" in each
sentence Is the cornerstone of the humor of It
They might just as well say that a man ha<i
a right to boast that he had increased the cur
rent of a river by putting a dam in it. be
cause the current had not stopped, but had
gone on over the dam â the man who would
attribute the current to the fact that the
dam was ln the Tlrer. or to the. fact that Jv*
j had placed any other obstruction there, would
not be a greater fool than he who would at
1 tribute an Increase of International or na
tional commerce to the operation of a policy
attempting vitally to obstruct it. Â¦ * â¢
A perfectly Ideal protective policy would
be one which did not admit a single possible
competing product of another country to tha
"protected" market. In so far as protection-
Ism falls short of that result, it Is a failure
from a protectionist standpoint. The non-aci
. mission of the products of other countries Into"
' your own markets and the refusal to purchase
â¢ from others certainly does not tend to make
them purchase from you. whatever else It does
As McKinley said: "We cannot always con
tinue to sell without buying."
Plainly our foreign commerce has grown, not
becauso of but in -spite of the obstructions
which have been placed in the current of trade.
How ridiculous the boast Is. too, in connee*
tlon with the flat-footed refusal of the Re
publican party In the Senate to approve th*
reciprocity treaties Instituted and completed
by Mr. McKinley and sent to that body by
him for approval, especially the highly benefi
cial reciprocity treaty with France, and in
the teeth of the refusal pf the Republican
administration to take any Initiatory step look
ing toward the reconvening of the joint high
comnalS31on for the purpose of establishing
reciprocal trade relations between our. neigh
bor Canada, and our children there and our
selves. Could complacent and recktess ef
frontery have gone further than it has gone
In making, this statement?
COMMERCIAL. RECIPROCITY.
There Is a succeeding statement, however
which will vtÂ« with it. It Is where the plat
form favors "commercial reciprocity whÂ«revsr
reciprocal arrangements can be affected with-
charge them higher prices than thosÂ» charged
foreigners for identical article*."
Suppcse that an actual condition of that sort
had been shown, as It has been, would anybodr
advocating an utterance of the sort I navÂ«
Indicated. with a view to meeting that condi
tion, have obtained any hearing from that
convention ?

ST. LOUIS, July 6. â Former Uuit

liam F. Sheehan to-day and assured
him that New Jersey would join' the

Senator Smith is auoted as having
said that he had received a telegram
from Cleveland declining positively to

Parker therefore was New Jersey's
choice. No positive confirmation,
however, was to be. had -of the re

PARLIAMENT REFUSES
TO LISTEN TO BALFOUR
LONDON, July 6.â In the House of
Commons to-night the Government
succeeded in carrying through the first
part of its closure programme oa
the licensing bill, but a hearing was de
nied to Premier Balfour, his frequent
attempts to speak being drowned by
loud cries of *gag." Finally Balfour,
hopelessly facing the tumult, Bat down.
This is said to be the first time in
a modern British Parliament when a
hearing was refused the Premier on the
floor of the House of Commons.
The full committee then entered
upon the consideration of the labor
question in connection with the follow
ing plank, presented by , ex-Governor
Thomas of Colorado:
Constitutional guarantees are violated when
ever the humblest citizen is denied the right
to labor, acquire and enjoy property or reside
where interest or Inclination may determine.
Any denfal thereof by individuals, organiza
tions or government should be summarily re
buked and punished.
Freedom of speech and of the press are
essential safeguards of civil liberty and the
Invasion of either cannot be too severely pun
ished
We denounce the Inflicting of punishments
without due process of law and deny the right
of any executive to disregard or suspend any
constitutional privileges or limitation. Obedi
ence to the laws and respect for their require
ments are alike the supreme duty of the citi
zen and the ruler.
The military must always remain subor
dinate to the civil power and be used only to
support and maintain law.
We unqualifiedly condemn its employment
for the summary baniehment of the citizen
without trial or for the control of elections.
ANGLING FOlt IiABOK VOTES.
Governor Thomas urged in strong
terms the adoption of the plank and,
in doing so, referred to the labor trou
bles In Ctf orado,: saying that the ac
ceptance of the proposition would do
much to render Colorado safely Demo
cratic. He Was replied to by McMahon
of Ohio, who said that, while -the
adoption of this plank might do much
to secure the labor vote, it probably
would have the effect of depriving the
party of having the support of the em
ployers. The labor question was then
temporarily laid aside.
Senator Tlllman pleaded for a strong
plank in support of the principle of
white supremacy in the South; He de
nounced the plank on this subject In
the platform submitted by Williams
and said:
"If we are to have a declaration at
all let us have one that means some
thing and not a weak-kneed, namby
pamby, flimsy thing like that in the so
called Williams platform."
The committee then entered upon a
series of hearings of outsiders, Includ
ing representatives of the Anti-Im
perialist League and the National
Woman Suffrage Association. The
Anti-Imperialists were represented by
Ira D. Howarth of the University of
Chicago. They asked for the Insertion
of the following plank:
Wo accept the great truths of the Declara
tion of Independence as principles of Justice,
limited to no time, place or race of men. To
hold a foreign people in subjugation is unjust,
undemocratic, un-American, subversive of our
national Ideals and a menace to our own
rights and Institutions. The retention of the
Philippines In. a relation of subjection to the
United States Is wrong In principle and an
unnecessary burden and peril. We should
treat the Filipinos as we treated the Cubans.
We, therefore, demand an immediate and
definite pledge of speedy Independence for these
Islands and insist that the United States Gov
ernment direct Its best efforts to the earliest
possible fulfillment of such pledge.
TRESEXTS SHIPPING, PLANK. .
The committee was asked to consider
the question of a shipping plank by
F. S. Pendleton of New York, who
spoke in behalf of a plank he presented,
which is as follows:
The Democratic partyâ the traditional friend
of American shipping â pledges Itself to the re
habilitation of the American merchant marine
through discriminating duties and tonnage
duties, the policy of the fathers and of the
great leaders of the Democratic party, under
which the flag of the United States filled the
ports and was a frequent sight on the sÂ«ias
of the world In all the years of Democratic
ascendency, while Its disappearance and the
deplorable decline of that once great and pow
erful Interest has been continuous under Re
publican legislation. Â¦

per cent of 'the same.-
ST. L.OUIS. July 6.â The Tammany
men are "sore" over the mistakes of
their leader, Murphy. They do not dis
guise their want of confidence in him.
Murphy has not surrendered, but he
stands practically alone in his organi
zation. His most distinguished, ad
viser, Bourke Cockran, has given up.
He sees no possible hope of defeating
Parker, but Murphy will not yield to
Hill. He cannot without taking second
place in New York politics.
Hill smiles his old sardonic smile as
he watches the Tammany men trying
to catch on to the Parker band wagon,
with Murphy standing alone and pro
testing that Parker cannot carry New
York. Hill and Sheehan are in control
of the convention. Murphy is not even
a factor. The Southern delegates will
do whatever Hill and Sheehan desire
regarding the ticket. They may not be
so pliant as to, the platform, but they
started out to nominate a New York
man and they will do it. They care lit
tle as to individuals. They want a
chance to carry New York.

That, with the view to the encouragement of
American shipping and the restoration of* the
American flag upon the high seas, we favor

paid, classified rebates of such duties shall be

Under the treaty with tho republic of
Panama, which was rendered possible only by
Democratic votes In tho Senate of the United
States âvotes very difficult for Democrats to
cast because of the manner In which the mush
room republic was ushered Into the world â
the Democracy, when intrusted with power,
will construct the Panama canal Â«peedily,
honestly and economically, thereby giving to
our people what Democrats have always con
tended for. a great interoceamc canal, furnish
ing shorter and cheaper lines of transportation
and better Rnd less trammeled trade relations
with the peoples of the world.
However shamefully the Panama republic
was born, however shameful our connection
witn It, iti was born and is now recognized by
us and by the other civilized nations of the
worid as an existing international entity, an
Independent Government on the surface of the
earth. In other words, it, too, is an accom
plished fact. With it, as the only power having
sovereignly and ownership, we were compelled
to negotiate a treaty for the acquisition of a
strip of land to be used for the construction
of the Panama canal, if we were to acquire it
at all. ! Entering into a treaty with the Gov
ernment of Panama In order to. acquire the
untold benefits of a trans-lethmlan canal no
more smirches ub with the shame of the man
ner of its setting up aa a mushroom republic
than entering into an extradition treaty with
Russia. Austria or Prussia would besmirch us
with the Bhame of the partition of Poland.
Above all and in conclusion, a good Demo
cratic administration will ponder and practice
the simple precepts > of JefferBon'e first in
augural address. It is the political .Sermon
on the Mount" for the Democracy.
Gentlemen, it Is - in the power of no man
cr party to assure success. It Is In the power
of the humblest to deserve It. God grant:that
we may have it. Let us, by the character of
our platform and the character of.our candi
date, deserve It. Let us erect a standard to
which all good men may repair. With that
injunction, gentlemen. I declare thiÂ» conven
tion ready for business.
The committee reconvened at 7 o'clock
and 'Senator Daniel announced the ap
pointment of a sub-committee to pre
pare a platform for submission to the
full committee as follows: Daniel, Vir
ginia; Hill, New York; Bryan, Nebras
ka;- Williams, Mississippi; Pattison,
Pennsylvania; Dubois, Idaho; Hamlin!
Massachusetts; Cable, Illinois; Poe,
Maryland; Shiveley, Indiana; Davis,
West Virginia. â¢
Senator Newlands made a plea for a
fuller representation of the irrigation
interests and by unanimous consent his
name was added to the sub-committee.
A number of suggestions from per
sons not connected with the committee
were received, among them being the
following from Senator Bacon of
Georgia:
SUB-COMMITTEE NAMED.
A general promise for the correction
of abuses is made, and under the head
of executive dictation Is this para
graph:
We call public attention to the repeated and
unpardonable dictation of President Roosevelt
to both branches, of Congress. We denounce
his flagrant encroachments upon the rightful
powers and independence and, while amazed
at the subserviency or a Republican Senate
and a Republican House of Representatives to
his orders and usurpation, we declare that his
autocratic invasion of their freedom deserves
and should receive the Indignant rebuke and
condemnation of the people.
We realize that, under the domination of
the corporate Interests and mighty and dan
gerous trusts and monopolies, which control the
policies and shape the .legislation of the Re
publican party, relief to the masses of the peo
ple from the glaring Inequality and gross in
justice of our existing tariff is absolutely hope
less, and that only under the relentless pres
sure of Democratic triumph can any Improve
ment whatever be obtained.
With a Democratic President and House cf
Representatives our party can and will takÂ«
the vigorous initiative toward the prompt, ef
fective and Just relief which the existing In
dustrial situation of the country Imperatively
demands. It Is pledged to this wise and be
neficent policy. It will revise the tariff in a
conservative spirit of fairness to all Interests.
Its anxious purpose will be to legislate with
such a due regard for the labor and capital in
volved in our industrial enterprises as to" pro
mote their healthy growth and "to carefully
guard against the infliction of injury upon In
dustries established by abrupt and radical
measures. But odious and powerful monopolies
may expect reduction of the excessive rates
under which they have been enabled to ex
tort oppressive tribute from the people. Ar.d
the illegal combinations of trusts which within
the last few years under the Republican tariff
have grown eo great and which In unlawful
restraint of legitimate trad<Â» have crushed hon
est competition must be stripped of the power
which they have so abused.
The financial plank la brief, being in
full as follows:
The Democratic party congratulates the
country upon the vindication of the Democratic
contention for an Increased volume of real or
metallic money In a manner acceptable by the
Democrats, by the addition to the world's
btock of money metals of $2,000,000,000 in
gold within eight years, from which these
Lnited States have been able to obtain $700 -
0<M),(rt)0. thereby doubling their stock of stand
ard mofley, raising their per capita from $23 to
f'.'tO and contributing to the aavent of indus
try, which could not otherwise have been at
tained. The fact that this result had been
reached by no action of the Government but
by the action of God. through his main instru
mentality of discovers-, invention and Industry,
does not lessen our gratification.
On the tariff and trusts this declara
tion is made:
UNIQUE FINANCIAL PLANK.
T\ e deplore and denounce the raising by the
Republicans of the race issue. We believe
that its wanton Introduction into this cam
paign cannot fall to obstruct and delay the
complete restoration of that harmony and good
will among the people bo essential to the peace,
happiness and prosperity of every section of thÂ«
Lnited States, and we demand that the regu
lation of the suffrage Bhall be left without
CongresElonal declaration to the several States,
subject only to the final Judgment of the Su
preme Court of the United States
Regarding the isthmian canal it says:
We favor the early completion of the isth
mian canal. Rut. while making this declara
tion and accepting from necessity the result
of the negotiations conducted by President
Roosevelt, we cannot too forcibly express our
deteftatin of the methods by which, in flagrant
disregard of law and treaty obligations, the
canal routo has been acquired, or too solemnly
record our hope that this precedent of diplo
macy may never be used against us to our
humiliation and injury.
A promise is made of a more econom
ical administration of the Government.
The race Question is touched upon as
follows:
The practical results of tho policy of imperi
alism Inaugurated by the Republicans and now
illustrated in the government of the Philip
pine Islands demonstrate the folly, danger and
injustice of tho conquest, subjugation and forci
ble control of alien races In remote Islands of
the eea. and. distinctly denouncing this policy
as without warrant in the letter or spirit of
the constitution and vicious in itself, we favor
the return at the earliest possible moment from
to radical and perilous a departure from the
traditions and long established practice of our
Government aijd the speedy substitution there
for of friendly relations with the Philippines
as' a free people, corresponding as early as Is
xeaeonably practical with our existing relation*
wth the people of Cuba.
The Norrls, or anti-Hearst, delegation
from the District of Columbia was
seated by a practically unanimous vote.
The committee was fully an hour
considering the evidence in the Illinois
contest and decided that all the Hop
kins delegates should retain their seats
save Duncan C. Best in the Twenty
first District. General Alfred Orndorf
was given the seat held by Best.
The Hearst delegates declare that
they will carry the Illinois contest to
the floor of the convention and fight to
the last.
Dr. Mary "Walker, attired in her
usual garb of Prince Albert coat and
trousers, was the first person to enter
the committee room and she remained
throughout the proceedings. Dr. Mary
claims a seat in the convention. She
says she was regularly elected a
woman delegate by the Democrats of
Oswego, N. T., and will wage a contest
to be seated.
At to-night's meeting James M. Head
of Tennessee and J. M. Corrigan of
Minnesota were nominated for perma
nent chairman. Head was Parker's
candidate and Hearst supported Corri
gan. On the vote the Parker men won
a decisive victory, Head being elected
by 32 to 12.
. By unanimous vote the committee de
cided to award the six seats and six
votes each to the delegation from the
Philippines and the Porto Rico delega
tion.

It will cpeak out unmistakably against th*
Republican policy of starving home develop

It will reduce the revenue of the general
Government to a sum adequate to the needs
of economical and constitutional administra
tion, plus a safe worklns margin for con
tincencles which cannot be foreseen.
The Democracy, In my opinion, believes that
the white man will have trouble enough to
maintain his full Integrity and the white man's
civilization in all parts of his own country,
and It 13 neither his duty ncr his right to eu
p?rimpcÂ«e bia civilization by force upon the
brown man In the brown man's country.
A Democratic President, such as he whom
Â¦Â»<â¢ shall nominate, will develop himself to the
faithful execution of the laws of the United
States aatbtyare written, without executive con
struction or usurpation, whether under the pre
text of necessity or under the pretext of supe
rior wludom, and will leave to thÂ» legislative
branch of the United States thp duty of mak
ing and unmaking and amending laws.
A Democratic administration once In power
will put an end, as far as it can be done and
a* quickly as possible, to all existing In
iquitous partrK-rEhip arrangements between tho
Federal Government and favored Special In
terests. â¢Â»
A Democratic administration will find In our
treatment of Cuba an example of American
courage. Justice and magnanimity, an example
to be Imitated as eoan as It can be wisely and
eafely done In the Philippines, ultimately leav
ing them, and giving them the promise now
thus to leave them, free, and Independent, to
work out their common destiny In accordance
wltii tlielr own race traits, tendencies and ca
pabilities.
Where thÂ»re is "brutal wrongdoing or knpo
tenry which rises In a genera! loosening of the
ties of civilized society," the American people
will rogret it and will extend every aid In the
way of enlightenment and example to the peo
ple thu* living In darkness, but they decline to
administer the affairs of such peoples, or rb
take upen the United States Treasury the bur
den of their internal reformation.
It will announce In an unmistakable way
that we have no duty of a sort to "Intervene"
In the national affairs of othÂ«r countries, be
cause they "do not conduct themselves well,"
or. because they "do not know how to aet with
decency In political and Industrial matter*/'
or because they "do net keep order," or be
cause they "do net pay their obligations. "
We v-ill announce unmistakably to the world
that we will not make of the army and navy
of the ITnit^d statÂ«s a constabulary for the col
lections of debts from the governments or peo
ples of South and Central America.
It will denounce the heedless and reckless
utterance of the candidate of the Republican
party for President In his letter to ex-Secretary
Root upon the eecond anniversary of Cuban In
dependence.
It will not f alter when It comes to declar
ing for a reduction of tariff taxation on trust
ptodured articles to the point where fore'gn
competition may entÂ»r the American market
when ccmbines ralÂ«?e the price to the Amer
ican consumer to the point of extortion nor
will It falter In declaring for reduction where
American concerns habitually charge Amer
ican consumers higher prices than those
charged forelg-ners for identical articles.
It will come out flatfooted fcr amicable
rnther tl-an retaliatory trade relations with
the other nations of the world and especially
for generous reciprocity with Canada.
But enough of the other party; tome things
about ourrelves. One thing the country can
rely upon: The Democracy will nominate for
President a man trained In the ways of the
constitution, who will not usurp legislative or
Judicial functions; who will not recklessly vio
late international usages, even with the weak
est ration, no matter how tempting the profits
to be reaped by it: who will not keep people

DEMOCRACY'S PKO3USE.
In tenpins with all this, consider the negro
Panto Bambino scene In the Republican Na
tional Convention, the wild adoration of "my
little Alabama rnon" â or was it Georgia coon?
Why was all this prearranged and by whom?
Why were the two little white girls placsd
on the same platform with the little- nÂ«-gro
boy to march around carrying flags? Who
prf tends that it was accidental? What was
the r-retendod lesson to be taught? What
is the subtle symbolical meaning of It all?
Is it a meaning which only white Republicans
dare to put Into words? Or is it a meaning
t.> l> Classed at and to be left to ' negro
orptors. speaking to negro audiences, to put
irto wurJs such as are adapted to negro races,
truits, U-ndencien and longings?
That is the ultimate significance of It all If
inder-d it be not merely "a voice In the xvllder
neFS." crying cut empty promises to the negro
voters in ihe doubtful States. I wish I 'could
believe it was only that. I would believe it,
but for the opinionated and euperstrenuous
character of "the man in the White House "
How small In comparison would be the' lrri^
mediate and ultimate significance cf a mere
partisan victory either way compared with
tlie necessary and natural results of this re
vi\ed notation.
This is but the entering wedge to a new pe
riod cf "Southern reconstruction." It Is the
beginning ever of the old scheme, revived for
peliticnl advantage, to retain as a Republican
a.Â«srt the oolld negro vote of Indiana. Illinois,
New Jsmsy and like conditioned States â Oil*
time without price In money paid â hy disutrb-
Ing ail over the Southland peace and order and
unsettl'ng business, and. a? a remote effect,
if successful, hybridizing the race there and
Africanizing Its civilization
Th*:r duplicity Is shown in this: They wish
to maintain the fifteenth amendment, which
forbid;- thÂ»> negro for racial reasons from be
ins disfranchised, and. acting on the pretense
that be is for racial reasons disfranchised, they
would have ihe negro not counted as a basis of
representation in the Southern States, where he
chiefly rfFlOes. It la not the white man, as a
white men, who is Injured by a recurrence of
the pendency of force till daysâ he can and
will always maintain himself in business, in
agriculture and in the manufactures. Com
nvri-'.ally and Industrially the white men of
thÂ» South will not be much more Injured by
this sort of agitation than Northern people
will be. The mercantile class would be the
first to Buffer, but as they owe debts -to the
North and buy from the North and as nearly
everything they jsell Is manufactured in the
North, they would not be alone In their suffer
ings.
Lot not the business Interest of the country
deceive itself; let those controlling It prepare.
If Roosevelt is elected on this platform, for
another period of uncertainty, unrest, business
disturbance and race war in the Southern
States, instead of that peace and prosperity
which both races now enjoy and which has
beÂ«-n rendered possible only by hemo rule and
by white supremacy.
Let the South not deceive Itself, either. If
the Republlran party was sincere In Its propo
sitien to reduce Southern representation on the
grounds cf dlsfranchiscment or pretended "un
constitutional limitation" Itself, It would ac
company the proposition with another â to wit:
the proposition to repeal the fifteenth amend
ment.
Disfranchise ment of a negro in Mississippi

been agreed upon. Hill and Sheehan
want a man from the Middle West,
where there is a possibility of getting
elcctofal votes. They do not desire
the nomination of ex-Senator George
Turner of Washington, because he
comes from the Pacific Coast. They
have no hope of eleqtora 1 votes from
that section. Turner has made head
way, but he has no definite promises.
To-night a boom was .sprung for
Aulai Stevenson of Illinois. Stevenson
was Vice President with Cleveland.
He was a candidate for Vice President
with Bryan. He has been affiliated
with both wings of the party and he
ccmes from the right section of coun
try. He may step into the shoes of
Marshall Field, who was most desired
for second place, but who would not
have it.
Hill and Sheehan have also talked of
Thomas Taggart of Indiana. Taggart
hoped to be made chairman of the
National Committee, but he will fall
in that Intention. The chairman will
be taken from the East! Taggart must
be placated and he may be offered sec
ond place on the .ticket.

We can assist you in many waysâ help you to
find a house, help you to make it comfortable and
homelike.
The new house always calls for something new
in the furniture lineâ a new carpet, or curtains, or
stove, or dining table. Means additional expense at
a time when the purse is taxed to the utmost.
Let us shoulder the worry. Your promise to
make a small weekly or monthly payment brings any-
thing in the house furnishing line to your door.
The Renting Department
Our renting department has passed the experimental
stage. We are finding homes for dozens of people every day.
It contains a memorandum of every desirable house, flat
or cottage that is to let in San Francisco.
Come and look over our lists.
This department is absolutely free and you need not feel
that it places you under any obligation whatever.
The Model Cottage
The cottage, containing four rooms, is built in the store.
It is furnished in an inexpensive way. $150 pays for the
furniture, but we give you a year's time in which to pav
the S150. 3
The way it is furnished may not meet with your ap-
proval^ we can furnish it in fifty different ways for the
same amount of money.
The cottage demonstrates that our furniture is low priced
and that we thoroughly understand our business â home

"Whenever we are not able to explain
complicated phenomena, we are at first
inclined to imagine that their cause
must be of similar complication to the
phenomenon itself. Thus the idea of
an invisible complicated egg-structure
was adopted in order 'to explain the
heredity of instincts and forms, and
thus the ideas of mysterious structures
of the gangleonlc cells are still held
by many in order to explain the me
chanism of reflex phenomena and In
stincts. All these attempts fail for the
reason that they tried to explain com
plicated phenomena without having
them analyzed Into their simpler con
stituents. As long as we consider In
stincts as units which cannot be de
composed, we must naturally imagine
the heredity of these instincts under
the mental picture of a mysterious
clockwork contained In the egg. But
as soon as we analyze them we are
confronted with very simple phe
nomena which make the Idea of a mys
terious invisible structure unneces
sary."
"Still another field of phenomena
makes it impossible to attempt to lead
back the heredity forms to mysterious
egg-structures of a highly complicated
nature. I mean the phenomena of
heteromorphosis*. By heteromorphosis
is meant the substitution of an
organ by another one which is dif
ferent morphologically and physiolo
gically. Tubularia, a hydroid. con
sists of a stem which carries on
one end a polyp or head and
on the other end a root or foot. If one
cuts oft the foot and surrounds the
wound with sea water from all sides a
new head is formed instead of a foot.
We thus have an animal which has a
head on each end of It3 body. But if
we bring the wound In contact with
a solid body, sur.h as the bottom of
the aquarium, a foot is formed. If
we cut a piece out of the stem, which is
only the size of the polyp, and sur
round it by water from all sides, a
head is formed at either end, but as
there is no material left between the
two heads, we thus obtain Janus heads,
without stem and foot.
The formation of a skeleton is noth
ing but the precipitation of crystals of
certain salts of calcium. The condi
tions for this are purely physical and
without doubt are determined through
metabolism and omotic processes.
Through their action such an increase
in the concentration of the intracellu
lar or pericellular liquids is produced
in certain places that these crystals
must be forced. Thus again, as in the
case of instinct, the analysis of the
phenomena renders the assumption of
mysteriously complicated structure in
the egg unnecessary.
ter into the Interior of the sphere. In
addition, capillary forces between the
cells probably play a role, too, in the
arrangement of the wall of the blaa
tula. Thus the cavity of the blastula
is formed. Therefore the egg does not
need any other qualities for the hered
ity of the blastula stage than certain
chemical substances and the osmotic
properties which are peculiar to almost
all living protoplasms, and which we
can imitate in the laboratory in artifi
cial .membranes.
"The formation of the gastrula from
the blastula presupposes that two dif
ferent substances are present in the
egg which form the ectoderm and the
entoderm. These may be . separated
from the beginning, and this would
harmonize with the assumption, al
ready made in regard to the instincts,
that the different poles of the animal
are already intimated in the unicellu
lar ess by a corresponding distribution
of the different substances, but it is
not even absolutely necessary that this
separation exists already in the origi
nal egg cell. It is quite possible that
migrations of the substances take place
in the blastula through osmosis, which
lead to a gathering of a specific ento
dermal substances at a certain place
in the biastula. Here the entoderm is
formed and invagination into the cav
ity of the blastula takes place.

By a decision handed down by Judge
Greene to-day people who did not have
the absolute decrees of divorce granted
them a year ago changed to interloc
utory decrees, but have treated these
decrees as final and married again, are
bigamists. He has stated that all ab
solute decrees granted by different
Judges throughout the State under the
apprehension that the present law was
unconstitutional are void and must
take the course prescribed by law. Un
congenial couples must first have an
interlocutory decree granted and then
wait a year and take out their final
decrees.
This decision was rendered to-day in
the case of Annie M. Smith, who was
granted an absolute decree of divorce
from John M. Sheppard a year ago and
allowed to resume her maiden name.
She did not have the absolute decree
set aside and an interlocutory decree
substituted, but after waiting the year
out, under advice of her attorney,
treated the divorce as final. A few
days ago she married Clarence Lang
tlon. By the decision handed down to
day she is still the legally wedded wife
of John Sheppard, from whom she be
lieved herself absolutely free.
Many other people in the State are
in the same condition.

The names of the committee which
issued the foregoing statement on be
half of the congregation were not
made public.
"Unfortunately Mrs. W. X. Bene
dict also left Oakland on June 20, but
at present there are absolutely no facts
to prove that their leaving on the same
day was anything more than a coin
cidence."
"Mr. Hoag for the past few weeks
has been in very poor health, which
may to a certain extent account for his
actions.
"Inasmuch as the affairs of our
church and our minister have been
discussed in the. press in the last few
days it stems proper to us to make
the following statement of facts:
"Mr. Hoag left Oakland for his va
cation on June 20 and on June 24
wrote a letter to George L. Voice ten
dering his resignation as pastor of our
church. For some reason, unknown to
us, this letter did not reach Mr. Voice
until July o.
TMrs. Hoag has also received a let
ter from Hoag, written on June 24, in
which he states that for reasons best
known to himself he will not return
to Oakland.
After the pastor's resignation had
been accepted this evening a commit
tee of three members of the congre
gatioif was appointed to draw up a
statement for the public. After some
discussion the committee issued the
following statement:
In his letter to Mr. Voice Hoag
makes no reference to Mrs. "W. X.
Benedict, whose husband accused the
missing minister of eloping with his
wife, but it is significant that both the
letter and resignation w'ere written be
fore any public accusation had been
made. Mr. Voice thinks that the delay
in receiving the letter was due to its
having been left with some one to be
mailed after Mr. Hoag had left San
Francisco, and this belief is strength
ened by the fact that the letter was
maiTed in Oakland.
"If you can, pray for me. I shall al
ways try to be a good man. I may
not live long, but while I do I shall
try to live right.
"If you still feel kindly toward me,
show it by being as kind as you can to
Mrs. Hoag and Allie. Charles W.
Hoag."
"I hereby present my resignation as
pastor of the church to take effect on
July 15, or at any time that you may
determine upon. Charles W. Hoag."
The pastor's resignation was re
ceived yesterday by Mr. Voice and was
enclosed in the following letter, which
was mailed in this city, and is dated
June 24, four days after the disappear
ance of the missing clergyman:
'"San Francisco, June 24. â My dear
brother (if I may still call you so): I
write to you because I think you un
derstand, at least in part.
"I am going away and in all prob
ability I shall never return. I know
this is a weak move, but it is the best
I can do.
The Rev. Charles Wayland Koag, the
missing pastor of the Plymouth Avenue
Congregational Church, has resigned
his pulpit, and the members of the con
gregation voted to-night to accept the
resignation, the same to take effect at

congregation by George L. Voice, sen
ior deacon of the church, by whom it
was received yesterday through the
mail, and it read as follows:

"Â¦What must be contained in the egg
in order to cause this succession of lar
val stages which finally lead to the
adult form of the sea-urchin? If -we
analyze the conditions which lead to
the . origin of these successive stages
we see that circumstances of no less
simplicity are sufficient as for the he
redity of Instincts. The blastula is de
termined through. two circumstances:
the fact that the spherical" egg Is sur
rounded by sea water, and that the os
motic and -metabolic qualities of the
protoplasm of the egg are of such a na
ture that liquid is pressed from the wa-
"It is well known that the egg of the
sea-urchin is at first a single spherical
cell, which, after fertilization, breaks
up into many correspondingly smaller
cells, from which aggregation of small
cells a v hollow sphere originates filled
with liquid, the so-called blastula. Â¦ The
wall of this hollow sphere is formed by
the small cells" of the egg. At this stage
of development the larvae are already
able to swim around.' A little later an
increased growth takes place in one
portion of this hollow sphere, and the
consequence is that this rapidly grow
ing part is pushed into the interior of
the hollow 'sphere. Thus the new em
bryonic phase is reached, the so-called
gastrula stage. Finally, in certain
phases of the gastrula crystals of cal
cium salts are formed and the skeieton
originates, with the formation of which
the embryo enters the so-called pluteus
stage.
SEA-URCHIN EXPERIMENT.
"The instinctive actions of animals
are hereditary and can only be trans
mitted through the sexual cells. The
problem of heredity from the physio
logical standpoint is in brief as follows:
How can an egg, a simple vesicle filled
with a viscous liquid which contains
seme solid constituents, be the . bearer
of such complicated mechanisms as the
hereditary instincts? Two views are
possible a priori: Either the simplicity
or homogeneity of the egg is only an
Illusion and in reality it contains an
invisible mysterious structure of a
similar degree of complexity to the
adult animal, or the complicated mech
anism of the instincts is the result of
very simple circumstances, which do
not require â¢any complicated structure
for their transmission through the egg.
All other possible suppositions are. only
compromises between these two pos
sibilities. Our present argument is in
favor of the latter solution, which, we
hope, will do away with some of the
mystic aspects of heredity and render
a number of very complicated, albeit
ingenious, theories redundant.
"As" to the mysterious egg structure
which this theory presupposes is ad
mittediy invisible it is impossible to
prove directly its non-existence. To the
second view' we are necessarily led
when we attempt to analyze the in
stincts Into their elements, which will
deprive them of much that seemed
very mysterious before.
"As far as the instincts are concerned
there is no reason to suppose that the
ess contains other mysterious compli
cated structures than such as might
possibly be expressed in the formulae
of the chemist. As soon as we decom
pose the complicated instincts into
their elements we understand that a
simple cell like the egg can be the
bearer of complicated instincts. The
conditions in the egg which are re
quired for this purpose are, first, polar
differences in the chemical constitution
in the egg substance; and second,
the presence of such substances
in the egg as determine heliotropic,
chemotropic, stereotropic and similar
phenomena of irritability.
"But the egg is the bearer of another
series of hereditary qualities, namely,
of the animal's bodily system. Again
we must raise the question how such a
simple thing as the egg can be the car
rier of circumstances which determine,
so complicated structures as are those
of most animals. Again we have, a
priori, the choice between two answers.
Either the simplicity of the egg struc
ture is only an illusion and we have in
reality an invisible structure of the
same degree of complexity in the egg
as that of the adult organism; or, sec
ondly, we do not require the mysteri
ous structures for the transmission of
such complicated mechanisms as seem
to be necessary for the formation of
organs, and comparatively simple con
ditions of the cellular substance in con
nection with external circumstances
are sufficient to explain the mystery.
Dr. Loeb's views were expressed in
a discourse under the subject "Theory
or Animal Instincts From the Point
of View of Heredity." He said in part:
INSTINCT HEREDITY.
Professor Jacques Loeb of the Uni
versity of California believes that after
all heredity in animals is transmitted
through a very simple mechanism, as
opposed to the theories of other scien
tists that the machinery is a most
complicated thing and difficult for men
to master. In the opiniQn of the great
biologist the simplicity of the process
is no mere illusion that is rendered
mysterious and enigmatic by an/in
visible movement beyond the power of
man to solve.
In a lecture before the students of
the summer school in the Philosophy
building this evening Dr. Loeb stripped
the veil of mysticism from the prob
lem that has been a source of long re
searching by himself and other biolo
gists. The eggs of animals that he has
investigated, he declares, do not con
tain any very mysterious complicated
structures. They are such that might
even be expressed in the formulae of
a chemist.

A meeting was held at the Fruitvale
school last night to consider the prop
osition which was addressed by Super
intendent of Schools T. O. Crawford.
Some of the trustees representing the
districts interested who were present
were W. S. Dunlevy, G. W. Hazelton,
R. H. Roane, Joseph Damm, George J.
Hans, Grubb and Taylor of Fruitvale
and Sawyer and O'Toole of Elmhurst.
In regard to the requirements Super
intendent Crawford told them that he
thought the establishment of such a
school would cost about $10,000 the first
year and half this sum the second.
This amount of money would pay the
rent of a building, pay three teachers'
salaries and equip a laboratory and
school rooms. He did not know but ft
might be done for $7500. Ninety-six
pupils were graduated from the gram
mar schools of these districts during
the past year and the necessity of such
a school he thought was very appar
ent. To. send a pupil to a high school
outside of the district costs the parents
$50 a year. By establishing one of
their own it would cost about $23 a
pupil.
The proposal to build a Union High
School by Bray, Elmhurst, Melrose,
Lockwood and Fulton school districts
is being actively agitated by the school
boards of these districts and it is be
lieved that by the time the Board of
Supervisors is ready to make the tax
levy these districts will have taken the
necessary steps to have their property
taxed for the establishment of a high
school of their own.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, July 6.
According to the report 665 pupils
failed of promotion during the last
twelve months and 10.561 were tardy.
The lar^e number of students who
came late is attributed by Mr. Moore
to the fact that the local schools open
at S:43 in the morning, while the usual
<'penir.g: time in other cities is S o'clock.
Jt is rrobable that there will be a
change made in this respect next term
and that 9 o'clock will be set for the
opening of the schools. Mr. Moore rec
ommends that domestic science be
taught the girls in the Alameda High
School, that the movement to establish
a public playground be encouraged and
that a kindergarten system be inaugu
rated in the local department.
Upon this point he rays:
"The large number of children who
are of school age but who are not at
tending school, as shown by the last
census reports, would argue the wis
dom of taking some steps for the en
forcement of the new compulsory edu
cation law. This can be done without
the adjunct of the parental school as
at first supposed. As soon as certain
statistics can be obtained from the
census roll sent to the County Super
intendent, I hope to place in each prin
cipal's hands a list of the pupils, names
and addresses who should be in school
but who are not. The cause of non-at
tendance in each case can then be as
certained and this will form a basis
upon which intelligent action may be
taken."
ALAMEDA, July 6.â In his report for
the last fiscal year now on file with
the Board of Education, Superinten
dent of Schools F. T. Moore gives the
exjvenscs of conducting the department
as JS5.211 80 as against $83,817 SO for the
preceding twelve months. He also as
serts in the document that there are
many children of census age who are
r.ot attending school and recommends
that the compulsory education law be
strictly enforced.

A statement of that kind desefves more than passing
attention. It shows that however proud we may be of.
our orchards we have no reason to be proud of our
methods of handling the crops. How completely the
French surpass us in that respect is shown by the Con
sul's statement. Writing from Bordeaux he says:
"In 1903, for instance, there. were almost no prunes
raised in this, regionâ probably not one-twentieth of the
normal crop. The deficit was supplied by the importa
tion of prunes grown in California and Oregon! This
fact I know from having been required to make in-
ALBION W. TOURGEE. American Consul at Bor
deaux, reports that French methods of packing
prunes are so much superior to those of our
packers. that the French can import California prunes,
repack them and send them back to this country, paying
duty as if they were French prunes, and sell them in
our markets, perhaps in California itself, at prices suffi
ciently high to yield a profit after defraying all the ex
penses entailed by the repacking and the double trans
portation across the ocean.
The coming bazaar In which so many
of them are interested will be under
the patronage of her Majesty and all

Considering the Countess' fascinating
personality and her husband's great

especially when the Prince of Wales
succeeds to the throne and the Princess
becomes England's Queen. Lady Dal

is the youngest daughter of Lord and
Lady Ancaster, and before her mar
riage was known as Lady Mary Wil
loughby. a name made historic by the
Jirst holder of the title, who was one
of the greatest soldiers of that war
rior King. Edward I. To good looks
Lady Dalhoutie unites a winning and
Fyrapathctic personality, and has lonÂ£
been active in many charitable works
vhich engage much of her mother's
attention. Lord Dalhousie owns about
128,000 acres in Scotland, a. couple of
castles, Erechin and Dalhousie, and an
other stately residence, Panmure
House, in Forfarshire. He is a youns
manâ not yet quite 2â¬ years oldâ but
has shown that he possesses the mar
tial spirit of his ancestors, having
served In the South African war as a

RED ANTSâ A. S.. City. There are
Insect powders that will destroy ants:
borax placed where they congregate
drives them away; they will run away
from green wormwood leaves placed
near their hiding places. An effective
way of killing them is to smear a plate
with clear lard and place It near where
they abound. They are very fond of
lard and wl!l go for It In the plate and
pay the penalty of their voracity by
being caught so they cannot escape.
When a plate is covered with ants hold
it over an open fire until the lard
captured ants fall into the flre; then
reset the plate. Another method la to
nil a sponge with fine sugar and, when
the cells are full, pour boiling water on
the sponge and scald the Insects to
death.

That, however, is not the proper way to measure the
cost of a Government. It is chosen because it makes
each individual listener feel that he is paying the whole
of it. All statisticians, economists and publicists esti
mate the cost of government by its cost per capita. The
cost of our Federal Government is just $7.97 per capita
per year. That is what each American pays for what he
gets from his country. It amounts to sixty-six and
seven-twelfths cents a month, sixteen cents a week, and
a fraction over two cents a day.
The sadly oppressed American citizen for two cents
a day gets the service of the whole Federal Government.
In cost there are only two Governments cheaper than
ours, India and China, and when compared with ours in
respect to what they do for the money they cost they
are. not in our class at all. The reader whose attention
is arrested by this article has at his service to-day the
whole army and navy, every Federal court, the Presi
dent and his Cabinet, every Foreign Minister and Con
sul, the Congress of the United States, and all and every
power of the Government, for only two cents. â¢'.;;
The picture is not fanciful; it is real. If an Ameri
can at home or abroad require the service of his Gov
ernment, for himself alone, one day, it costs him two
cents for the use of every branch of the Government and
every part of every branch that his need may require.
It is well .to keep this in mind when we are told .the
Government oppresses? us through its cost. Our Gov
ernment is equal to the best ever enjoyed by man, and
its economy is excelled only by China and India.
It is always -lamentable when the emergencies of a
party compel a resort to tactics that blackwash the
country. If all that is said about our Government and
its cost is true we are suffering greater oppression than
any other people and bear it with more ox-like patience
than any. Fortunately these misrepresentations of the
results of more than a century of free government 'are
not true, nor in the nature of things can they ever be
true.
The cost of the Federal Government has been dis
cussed since the constitution was adopted in conven
tion, and the specter of a central government, costing the
people dearly and rendering no equivalent service, was
invoked to prevent the formation of the Union in 1789.
But the effort failed then and though often repeated it
lias not succeeded in separating the trust and affection of
the people from the Federal Government, nor destroyed
their reliance upon it as the source of order and law and
protection for the institutions of liberty. The money of
the people paid in support of the Federal Government all
has to be appropriated by Congress, and in the aggrc
gate*appropriations we get the measure of the cost of all
that the Federal Government does.
The attack of Mr. Williams and the peculiar people
whom he leads is made upon what they call the "Billion
dollar Congresses" of the Republican party. Each
Congress has a life of two years and it must make the
necessary appropriations to carry on the Government
for two fiscal years. The reproachful term had its or
igin when the expenses of the Federal Government rose
to a billion dollars for two years or $500,000,000 per year.
Looked at in the lump.it seems an enormous sum. .Mr.
Williams is fond of figuring it down to so much per day,
per hour and per minute to make people groan and flinch
from their wrung withers. Â«
IN these days of political oratory and while the voice
of the spell binder is heard in the land and also the
tap-tap-tapping of the party platform-maker, busy at
his work, it is well to take a few fore and back sights.
The favorite themtf of the politician in campaigns is
the enormous cost of government. Mr. John. Sharp
Williams, the Democratic floor leader in the House, is
brightly gifted as a manipulator of figures to prove that
we are the most, tax-ridden people on the earth. His
voice is raised to denounce the extravagance of the Re
publican party and his picture of the woes of the people
is enough to make even a tax collector weep. His
method of promoting the interests of his party does not
promote the welfare of his country, nor does it do jus
tice to republican institutions. _ Surely if this, the
greatest of the republics, is a failure and visits upon its
citizens the several forms of oppression, repression anc*
depression charged against it by Mr. Williams, the hir
tory of the United States is a warning to the world to
avoid republican institutions, and a loud cry to adver
tise the fact that the Goddess of Liberty is a brazen
huzzy. >

The Board of Health has found it necessary to reduce
the number of patients in the City and County Hospi
tal and to weed out many that have usurped public ser

tent to prevent violence and murder in the place. Re

Lucid Explanations.
The opinion b.cks judicial tone and balance. It fails
to state what recourse the people of the mining district
had who were deprived of all their rights under the
constitution, not by the Governor, but by the secret
councils of the inner circle of the Miners' Federation.
They controlled the legal machinerj' of local govern
ment, and thereby held the constitution and the law. in
suspension.. Not only was their punishment impossible
by the local government, but their restraint was also im
pofMble. Every writ known to the judicial processes for
protecting life and property and restraining crime was a
vain thing.
When an attack was made upon a mining property
there and non-union miners and the owners were ex
pelled and the owners appealed to the Governor for
protection an officer of the law telegraphed him that his
action was unnecessary, for the mine was "in the peace
able possession of the Miners' Federation." A search
of the constitution and laws of Colorado fails to revea!
any process by which judicial protection could be ex
tended to the owners of that property, dispossessed, and
their workingmen evicted and deported under the eye of
the officers of the law, who were accessories to the crime
by making no effort to prevent it.
Turning his own phraseology against himself, the
Miners' Federation, having immunity to take possession
of the property of others and to deport a hundred work
ingmen, wound and maim them and forbid their return,
all the people in that district depended for their liberty
not upon the constitution, but upon the grace and favor
of the Miners' Federation. With no judicial remedy in
sight another organization, equally powerful and equally
criminal, might next proceed to take possession of the
ranches at Greeley, or on Clear Creek,' or at Rocky Ford,
and deport the ranchers, and having control of the local
government could do so with as much impunity as the
Miners' Federation enjoyed until the Governor took a
hand in the proceedings.
It is a rule of law and logic that a proposition cannot
be negatived except by j substitute proposition. This
rule is violated. by Justice Steele. He attacks the action
of the Governor and repudiates the majority opinion of
the court, of which he is a menjber, without saying what
should have been done by the Governor or the Govern
ment under the circumstances as they existed in the law
less counties of the State.
He also ignores another element in the situation. The
Governor took jurisdiction in the existence of certain
facts of public knowledge. He could not create those
facts. They were the work of criminals whom the
courts could not reach by reason of the failure of local
government. The Supreme Court surely could not
reach it, for it has only appellate jurisdiction. Justice
'Steele does not- say, but probably thinks, that the Gov
ernor should have waited until the local authorities
called on him to protect life and property and restore
constitutional rights within their jurisdiction. But the
Justice knows also that the local authorities were them
selves a part of the lawlessness, of the disorder and
crime, and that if the Governor had waited for them
every non-union man would be by this time murdered
or deported and every mine in the district would be "in
the peaceable possession of the strikers," to be worked
as they dictated or not at all.
The course of the Governor does not depend on the
single precedent of the military deportation of the
Nauvoo Mormons by Governor Ford. President Cleve
land, mindful of his oath that the laws of the United
States be impartiallj r enforced, sent the regulars to Chi
cago and used them in California to suppress in 1894 the
same conditions that have made riot in Colorado. Gov
ernor Altgeld protested in vain. The President restored
order. Governor Peabody took an oath to faithfully en
force the laws of Colorado. There is a maxim that is
the moral part, of every constitution and every statute:
''The public safety is the supreme law."
The Justice supposes a'case in which another Governor
may deport farmers willfully. The constitution pro
vides punishment for a Governor by impeachment if he
exercise power without reason. With the right of im
peachment to restrain him no Governor will intervene
except for the public safety. Justice Steele's opinion
would have been respectable, even if untenable, if he had
pointed out what the Governor should have done in
stead of decrying what he did.
JUSTICE STEELE of the Colorado Supreme Court
dissents from the rest of the court in its opinion
sustaining Governor Peabody in the measures ne
cessary to make life and property safe in' the mining dis
tricts of that State.
Justice Steele denies the deposit of authority in the
Governor to restore order by executive action. In his
opinion he says: '"If the present Executive is the sole
judge of the conditions which can call into action the
military power of the Government and can exercise all
means necessary to effectually abate the conditions, and
the judicial department cannot inquire into the legality
of his acts, the next Governor may, by his ukase, exer
cise the same arbitrary power. If the military may de
port the miners this year it can deport the farmers next
year, and we shall depend for our liberty not upon the
constitution, but upon the grace and favor of the.Gov
ernor and his militarv subordinates."

And thereby hangs a tale regarding
these Anglo-American hostesses and
thÂ« Queen. Hitherto It has been the
custom for American society women
In 'London to compete one with another
in works of charity. Mrs. Ronalds and
Mrs. Arthur Paget have, of course, for
years worked together, but as fresh
American women found their way into
English society each of the new arri
vals In her turn commenced a small
charitable campaign of her own. The
Duchess of Marlborough was especially
noticeable In this respect. She desired
to be a charitable institution in herself.
The Queen, when she was Princess of
Wales, anxious to do anything and
everything tcr open the purse strings
of charitably disposed persons, never
refused to lend her patronage to any
scheme promoted' or organized by re
sponsible women. Since she has be
come Queen she has not the time to
devote to individual effort and I un
derstand that her Majesty informed
Mrs. Ronalds, who passed the word
along, that she would be glad if the
American ladies would Join forces
wherever possible. The result is that
in most cases in future American
women will work collectively so far as
charitable undertakings are concerned.
spections of the condition of. such importations and
afterward to give testimony in litigation resulting from
controversies over the quality and salable character of
such prunes. Though the prune crop of this region was
so small as to be almost negligible, the quantity in the
markets of the world not being large enough, in fact, to
supply the home demand, the export of French prunes
was' not materially lessened: I have been unable to get
any information that any were shipped as 'California
prunes.' None passing through this- consulate was in
voiced as such."
Thus it appears that France holds foremost place in
the world's market for. prunes, not because she pro
duces more or better prunes than California, but .be
cause her packers and merchants know better how to
market them. As a matter of fact California deals with
her fruit in much the same way the South used to deal
with cotton; producing it in abundance but selling it
cheaply as raw material for others to make a profit from.
The South has learned, her lesson and. is now rapidly be
coming the manufacfurer of her cotton crop. California
should imitate her example. There is rto reason what
ever why prunes grown in Santa Clara County should be
shipped to Bordeaux to be packed in order to command
good prices in the markets of San Francisco.

8thi? following three questions to which
no immediate answer was required:
"Do not your books show that re
ceipts were issued for more wheat than
was ever received?"
"Do not your books show that re
ceipts were issued to Eppinger & Co.
for more wheat than was received?"
"Is it not a fact that there was writ
ten in 20,000.000 pounds of wheat and
12,000,000 pounds of barley more than
was received?"
The argument as to the custody of
the books which was to have been held

of them will not be enforced. The case
goes on at 10 o'clock this morning.

City Engineer Woodward yesterday
filed a report upon the street cleaning
in Los Angeles with the Board of
Works. The report states that one
half of the street sweeping in that city
is done by public contract, the con
tractors using the ordinary rotary
broom machines at night. Scrapers are
used in the busy retail district instead
of brooms, thereby preventing the
raising of dust. The cost of running
three rotary sweepers nightly for 300
nights would be 120,325, but a saving
of $2925 would be^ effected with three
Furnas suction street cleaners. Wood
ward recommends that the three ma
chines be purchased to replace three
rotary sweepers now in use.

The advance sale of seats for the
first week of Miss Barrymore's en
gagement begins to-day.
Miss Barrymore is considered to
day as one of the particularly bright
!ights of the stellar field and has a
very fashionable following. Her pro
duction of "Cousin -Kate" .was distinct
ly the most successful comedy offer
ing, of the past season in New YorK
and despite the lack of interest in
theatricals her performance .v;ts of
such a caliber as to make it necessary
to play four return engagements in
order to meet the demand. Miss Bar

entire New York cast, including among
others Bruce McRae, Grant Stewart,

alarm connects with the City Hall po
lice station, where some newly ap
pointed policemen were awaiting the
call of duty.
When the alarm came visions of
burglars making a raid on the mil
lions belonging to the municipality
stirred the force. Sergeant White was
in charge at the station, and, getting
the new recruits Into line, he sharply
gave the order, "To the Treasurer's
office, my men."
The squad raced in double-quick
time to its destination and as the po
licemen neared the treasury they
stepped very softly. They, closed in
on the vaults from all sides, but found
no burglars. Treasurer McDougald ex
plained the situation and the new re
cruits retired with glory from the
scene.
Some one accidentally stepped on
the burglar alarm in the vaults of the
city treasury yesterday afternoon and
brought a squad of twenty-five police
men to the city's strong box. The

rOPl'LAK ACTRESS APPEARING
AT COLUMBIA THEATER NEXT
MONDAY IN "COUSIN KATE."
Pie*rce secured a temporary injunc
tion against the union compelling it
to remove the pickets and desist from
the many acts complained of. It was
agreed In court by both sides that the
hearing of the application to make the
injunction permanent would be made
in the nature of a test case to decide
the right of unions to prosecute boy
cotts and maintain pickets.
It Is also denied that the pickets
called forth in loud and threatening
tones to the patrons or customers of
the stables.
It Is denied that the union placed
representatives or pickets in front of
his place of business, who have called
opprobrious names or have threatened
bodily harm to the non-union employes,
or that said agents have waylaid and
assaulted non-union men.
It is denied that the union harassed,
annoyed or threatened the worklngmen
employed by Pierce, or that it threat
ened him with boycott or that It would
inflict violence upon him, his property
or the men working for him.
The union denies that it conspired or
confederated to devise methods to Im
pede Pierce in the transaction of his
business or to interfere with his rigs,
or by threats and intimidation or as
sault to force his employes to quit their
work.
OFFERED XO THREATS.
The answer in the suit of R. G. Pierce
against the Stablemen's Union, which
was to have been filed in the Superior
Ccurt on Tuesday, made its appearance
yesterday and the case will probably
be heard to-day by Judge Hunt. The
attorneys for the union are Maguire,
Lindsay & Wyckoff and Houx & Bar
rett. Every allegation of the proprie
tor of the Nevada Stables is denied
specifically with certain reservations.
The union denies that, prior to the
strike which it ordered at the Nevada
Stables, it devised or us.ed means to
injure the business of the plaintiff, ex
cept that certain members of the union*
stated that they would not work for
the Nevada Stables and the union and
its members would request their
friends and sympathizers to withdraw
their patronage from the stable, until
the employes are granted the terms
and conditions of employment fixed by
the union.
It is denied that since the strike the
union has annoyed or harassed Pierce
in his business, save that since the
strike the members of the union have,
by respectful written and oral an
nouncements, sought to, advise the
friends of the union to refrain from
patronizing the stables until they
should ceasÂ©- hostility to the union and
to its principles and purposes.
DENIALS OF STARLEMEX.
Stephens says that the union has a
membership of more than 100 and its
jurisdiction extends throngh the coun
ties of San Francisco, San Mateo,
Marin and Alameda. Thomas Allen is
president and Edwin T. Kinucan sec
retary. Stephens became a member on
June 23, 1903, and has paid his dues
until July 1, 1904. He says that he
has been following his occupation as. a
marble finisher for years, but since
April 28, last, he has been harassed,
annoved and insulted and prevented
from obtaining any work.
He quotes a letter which he received
from the union on May 4, in which it
was stated that reports had been re
ceived from "brother members" at Col
ton saying that his actions had con
vinced them that he was a "trouble
maker," a "stool pigeon" and had been
instrumental in "knocking" certain
members of the union there. Stephens
says that the charges in the letter were
false, malicious and libelous and with
out any specific charges being served
up him he was tried and expelled
from the union. Since then he has
been prevented from obtaining work
at his trade ami employers have been
notified that they would be boycotted
If they hired him. '
Another man has decided to find out
through the courts if a labor union
has any right to prevent him from
earning a living. A suit was com
menced yesterday for $15,000 damages
by Edward Stephens against the Jour
neyman Marble Cutters and Finishers,
Local Union No. 23S, its officers and
members. W. A. S. Nicholson is at
torney for the plaintiff and Bush Fin
nell of the* Citizens' Alliance will as
sist in the prosecution of the suit.
Deputy United States Immigrant
Inspector D. J. Griffiths will leave for
Jackson, Amador County, to-day to
bring to this city Antonio Avenzino
for examination by a special board of
inquiry with a view to his deportation
to Italy. Avenzino is said to be an
anarchist, affiliated with certain well
known anarchists, mostly Italians, in
that county, and the United States
is not large enough to hold him. He
arrived as an immigrant at the port
of New York on the steamship,Wei
mar on April 25, 1903. A short time
ago he was arrested in Jackson on a
charge of mayhem, and when search
ed by the constable a bundle of anar
chistic circulars and text-books were
found upon his person.
The case was reported by Commis
sioner North to the Department of
Commerce and Labor and an inves
tigation was made of Avenzino's rec
ord in Italy. This resulted in the
discovery that he had been convicted
there of a felony of a non-political
nature. He comes, therefore, under
the ban of the law as an alien crimi
nal, not eligible for admission Into
the United States. Should the special
board of inquiry find the charge to
be true Avenzino will be sent back to
Italy, where he will be taken care of
by the authorities of that kingdom.
Strong testimony was brought out
by the prosecution in the Eppinger
case yesterday, both through the in
troduction of letters and from the lips
of witnesses. The letters showed that
lÂ«Â«ts of jrrain, mortgaged to local banks,
had been ordered shipped away. W.
W. Toprnns- bookkeeper for the firm
of Epplnger & Co.. admitted that he
had issued warehouse receipts for
grain which his books did not eho-\v
to be in the warehouse and also that he
had repeatedly back-dated receipts.
During his examination Tuesday, Top
/ir.g said that he had a very poor
memory and his answers yesterday
certainly bore out that assertion. Just
before the adjournment of court three
Questions were asked him which bear
strongly un the case, but the court
wijl nÂ«H rule until this morning as to
whether or not they are allowable.
BAD GRAIN SHIPPED.
< irp of the letters introduced in evi
d-'Hi-e tends to show that the books
kept at the Pacific Coast Warehouse
Company's buildings at Crockett did
rot contain a true record of the trans
itions there, but that a private mem
orandum was k<*pt. The letter is as
fallows:
"March 11. 1903.
" Pacific Coast Warehouse Company,
O-.u-keitâ Gentlemen: As we told you
by telephone^ Mr.Cook complains great
ly about 50 sacks of seed barley which
v as sent up adulterated with black
oats. We understand you have cleaned
uj> the balance of the barley since.
Please send us sample by your man
in the morning, or if you are coming
bring; down sample yourself.
"We not*Â» in your report of March
3: L.. B. Dlrey lot, 1203 sacks; C. S.
Moses lot, "089 sacks. Is this amount
Â¦of wheat on hand? Option lot 753.
You only have balance of 10 sacks, and
in option lot 759 balance of 62 sacks,
lias this been delivered cut. for the
parties who hold the receipt or have
you replaced the full file again? When
you come down fro-motrow bring your
private, book with you so you can an
swer these questions correctly. Re
spectfully, EPPINGER & CO."
An attempt was made by Attorney
Campbell for the prosecution to intro
duce in evidence the bankruptcy pro
ceedings before the District Court, by
which he seeks to show that the mem
bers of the firm knew that it was bank
rupt lnne before the collapse on June
6. 1903, and borrowed money knowing
it could not be repaid. The defense ob
jected tn this line of evidence and
Judge Lawlor took the matter under
advisement and will make a ruling to
day.
QUESTION' OF HEALTH.
Calvin Langton, who acted in the
dual capacity of grain inspector and
< -irifidential clerk in the local office of
The firm, v.as closely questioned by At
torney Ach regarding the physical con
dition of the defendant during the
months prior to the failure. "Jacob Ep
pinger." the witness said, "was ill for
several months and rarely visited the
<>f!ice." The letters were signed by
Langton. but he paid little attention to
their "contents. They were as a rule
dictated by one of the members of the
firm and carried to Langton. and he
tiened the firm name to them. Ach
pressed the inquiry regarding the
health of Jacob Kppinger closely, evi
dently trying to lay a foundation for
an argument to the effect that the de
fendant was mentally Incompetent
Â¦when the alleged frauds were commit
vd and cannot therefore be held cul
pable.
In response to a question from Attor
ney Campbell as to Eppinger's place in
\ho firm, the witness replied:
"He was the head of the firm and
transacted the business. He negotiated
the loans and signed the notes and ex
amined the warehouse receipts."
W. W. Toppingv formerly bookkeeper
' for the firm, was put on the stand, de>
spite his protest that he was "tired of
it," and asked if he had not made out
receipts for certain lots of grain which
were not in the warehouse. He replied
that he did.
"Were they not issued for wheat that j
was to come in?" was asked.
"I don't know," replied Topping.
"Why did you make out receipts for
grain you did not know was in the
warehouse?"
"I was told to do bo."
"I don't know."
WORTHLESS RECEIPTS.
"Did you not. at the direction of a
member of the flrmj Issue warehouse
receipts for grain when there was no
â¢grain reported in?"
"1 am not sure that it was by a mem- j
ber of the firm, but I did issue ware- \
house receipts for grain not reported i
in."
"Was it from any person connected j
with the firm?" \
"It was from some one from the back !
office."
The witness then explained that be- j
sides the members of the firm Josua i
Eppinger had access to the "back of
fice." Attorney Campbell then asked

who do not need the money have hung
out "rooms to let" signs In order that

Governor Pardee, with Governor
Odell, was entertained by the board of
lady managers of the exposition one
night this week. The New York execu
tive grew facetious at California's ex
pense by saying: "Why. we have one
county that churns more butter than
the whole State of California produces."
Governor Pardee turned the laughter
against him by saying that If 'Odell
tried to tell what New York didn't have
that California did he would keep the
floor all night.

Mr. Erwin has In view an elaborate

The many Californians who are com
ing now are finding no difficulty In se

and are surprised at the reasonableness
of restaurant fare. No exposition city
has ever been worse slandered than has
St. Louis. With a national political
convention ready to open and 50,000
teachers here to attend their annual
gathering, besides the great host of
general visitors, there are plenty of
good rooms at 51. Up to the present
time the weather has been pleasant.
Trunks are hauled to most, any part of
the city for from 50 to 75 cents.
These slanders are even circulated in
Chicago, where delegates to the Repub

a room, J10 apiece a day for a bed. Up
to this time good rooms In the best St.
Louis hotels have been obtainable, two
in a room with two beds, for 53 50 a

Of course, greater cupidity may de

prices comes it will not be before Sep

"WORLD'S FAIR, ST. LOUIS, July 6.â
The question of a successor to E. B.
Willis, who has resigned as secretary
of the California Louisiana Purchase
Exposition Commission, is being re
volved In the mind of Governor Par
dee. If the commission has its way.
Miss Pringle, its stenographer, will
perform the duties of secretary for the
remainder of the fair at some salary
far less than the $200 monthly provid
ed for by the statute creating the com
mission. She will, of course, be given
an assistant at a salary still smaller
than that allowed her.
There are probably some wide awake
Californians with Influence, however,
who would like to spend the next five
months at the fair and keep track of
State matters there for 5200 a month
and expenses and the Governor will
probably be prevailed upon . to name ]
a new secretary. There are several
Californians here who are already
reaching out for the position and news
has reached here that every other man
in Alameda County <vants the posi
tion. It is understood that Miss Pringle
is averse to taking the place for less
than the full $200 a month.

San Francisco, through her repre
sentatives, George P. Wilcomb and J.
W. Erwin, took an active part in the
opening of the Model City at the ex
position. Governor Pardee spoke for
San Francisco and the State of which
it is the metropolis at this event and
on behalf of the State and municipal
ity turned the building over to the ex
position. The Governor spoke just be
fore President Francis and said that
though it was a long distance between
St. Louis and San Francisco it was not
a long distance between the friendly
sentiments of their people. He spoke
of the greatness of San Francisco's
commerce and her tremendous pro
gress and said she and the iState of
California were loyal in every breath
to the nation and to the exposition
which represented It. His speech was
one of the best delivered by any
State executive 'and drew loud ap
plause.
RECEPTION IS HELD.
After the services of dedication,
which were held on the; steps of the
Guild Hall in the Model City, a very
succcessful reception was held at the
San Francisco building. Refreshments
were served and Messrs. Wilcomb and
Erwin enlisted the services of some
bright San Francisco ladies to assist
them in receiving the many' guests.
Mrs. Qeorge Marsh, Mrs. Martha

The victim of matrimony tore his
Hooliganesque beard and sighed. He
told a tale that would draw tears from
the eyes of a potato. Three years ago
he was a prosperous country editor,
who warbled merrily as he wielded his
pen. One day he came face to faces
with Minnie. Jennie, Nora, Katie, Nell
and Dora. It was love at first sight
with Harvey. The fickle damsels pre
tended that his wholesale affection was
returned. The trusting editor led them
to the altar and the seven were made
one. There was unlimited rice and old
ehoes and a honeymoon.
Then came trouble. Minnie began
to hold a more extended conversation
with the baker than was necessary to
buy the bread. The butcher used to
wink at Jennie. While talking to the
policeman Nora forgot the baby car
riage and let it roll down an embank
ment Into a wasp's nest. Katie did
not scorn the attentions of a dry goods
clerk; Nell thought the doctor was nice
and Dora thought the groceryman was
lovely.
In wrath the husband started to chas
tise his better sevenths. The ladies re
taliated with kitchen implements. Har
vey took second money and very little
at that.
He was thrown into jail for battery.
There his clothing disappeared and
when he was released he was clad in
a pair of trousers known as â¢"hiph
waters" and a Fauntleroy blouse. On
the way to the railroad station he
swapped clothes with a scarecrow.
Arriving in San Francisco, he wrote
a letter to Minnie, Jennie, Nora, Katie,
Nell and Dora. That letter caused his
arrest by Marshal Shine.
Harvey would like to regain posses-
"Excessive matrimony like excessive
drinking leads to evil." declares J. C.
Harvey, who is held in the City Prison
on a charge of shipping impolite but
expressive language through Uncle
Sam's mall.
"It's enough to shake any man's faith
in womankind," says Harvey, "when
he has six wives and they all prove
untrue. And when the whole bunch is
granted alimony there is nothing left
but the first freight train.
"How I trusted those women. There

and Dora. We were the happiest cou
ple â I mean seven â In Preston, Idaho,
where I was editor of the Cash Valley
News. Now my wives are whooping
up the town, on the proceeds of my
printing riant and I'm worse than
widowed."
The first request in the will Is that
the body of the deceased be cremated.
Then Mrs. Norris bequeaths to Edith
King Davis, her daughter, all of her
Jewelry, plate, linen, wearing apparel
and household effects. The personal
property thus disposed of all the re
mainder of the estate is given to the
Union Trust Company as trustee. The
trustee is to pav $3000 to Norris King
Davis, a grandson; $40 a month during
her lifetime to Ruth Harriette Wiggin,
a sister; $250 a month to Edith King
Davis, wife of Horace Davis, and 5500
a month to Edith Boswell King for the
maintenance of herself, her husband
and their children. If Frederick King
survives his wife he Is to receive $150
a month and the children $350.
All of the income from the estate not
disposed of under, the will is to be ac
cumulated in the hands of the trustees
and every five years, while the trust
lasts, four-fifths of it is to be paid to
Edith B. King. If any of Freder
ick's children desire a collegiate educa
tion the trustees are instructed to pay
for It, and they must pay certain taxes
enumerated.
The trust Is to hold until the death
of Frederick R. King and his wife
Edith Boswell King and then, share
and share alike/ what remains in the
estate is to be distributed among their
children. - Â¦ . .'Â¦Â¦ .'
A trust that will not cVd until Fred
erick Randolph King and his wife are
dead is created in the will of Julia N.
Norris, widow of "William Norris and
Thomas Starr King respectively. Edith
Boswell King, the daughter-in-law, is
named as executrix, without bonds, and
she is the chief beneficiary, but, outside
of the fixed allowances the estate will
be in full control of the Vnion Trust
Company until the time comes when it
shall be distributed among the children
of Frederick King. One of the princi
pal assets of the rich estate is the Stan-
King building on Geary street.
The will and Mrs. King's petition for
its admission to probate were filed yes
terday by Attorney M. B. Kellogg. It
Is stated that the heirs at law are the
daughter, Edith King Davis, wife of
Horace Davis, and Frederick R. King,
the son. Mrs. Norris died on June 30,
at the age of 76.

Regarding the recommendation of
the Health Board that the limit of
bacteria in each cubic centimeter be
fixed at 30,000, as Is the case In New
York, the committee decided to have
tests made from some of the best dair
ies. Allowance will be made for the
time of transportation and the stand
ard will then be based on the tests
thus made.
The rule requiring wash rooms to
have floors of wood was revised so
that the floors may be of wood, as
phalt or concrete, the health officials
agreeing to the change.
The committee decided to meet next
Saturday and consider the objections
trf the dairymen and to formulate the
rules which it desires to Incorporate In
the ordinance. Practically all the rules
have been agreed upon, the only ones
against which strong protests have
been filed being those relating to ven
tilation, which would require the en
tire reconstruction of the dairy build-
Ings.
The dairymen strongly objected to
the rule requiring milk utensils to be
washed In a strong solution of lye and
salsoda, claiming that it would Injure
the hands of the milkers and some of
the solution might find its way into the
milk. The rule was changed so that
the utensils may be washed in a solu
tion the strength of which is not speci
fied.
The dairymen and Health Board of
ficials were again In consultation yes
terday with the Supervisors' Healtn
Committee relative to the Incorpora
tion In an ordinance of proposed rules
and regulations for the conduct of
dairies.
There seemed to be a better spirit
of amity . between the dairymen and
health officials and rapid headway was
made in the matter of agreeing on the
regulations. No mention was made of
the previous threat of the dairymen
that the price of milk would be raised
if the regulations considered by them
as too drastic were put Into effect.
John D. Daly. M. Haley and J.
Brewer registered objections to some
more of the rules and in most instances
the Health Board agreed to a modifica
tion thereof. The rule prohibiting cows
to be fed with moldy hay or decom
posed vegetables was agreed upon with
the proviso that beet pulp may be used
as food.

JSVNSET &A7.AAÂ®.GOLDEN JUBILEE OF REPUBLICAN PARTY IS CELEBRATED WITH ENTHUSIASM
AT ALHAMBRA THEATER AND THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE INDORSED
THE Republican party was born on June 6, 1854, at the little city of Jackson, Mich. Its Golden Jubilee was celebrated yesterday in every part of the nation. The Republicans of
San Francisco, in a great mass meeting last night at the Alhambra Theater, honored the anniversary, pledging renewed devotion to Republican principles and loyal support to the
Republican candidates. Samuel A\. Shortridge, George A. Knight, John T. Dare, Henry C. Dibble, Julius Kahn, E.I.Wolfe and Cary Van Fleet were loudly cheered as they
painted the party's services to the country and predicted the triumphant election of Roosevelt and Fairbanks.

Judge Henry C. Dibble was intro

sembled to celebrate our golden jubi
lee and to indorse that grand states
man and brilliant soldier^ Theodore
Roosevelt.
"By the providence of God, Roosevelt
is the President of the United States
to-day and he will be continued by the
American people. The welfare of our
government demands that the safety of
our government must rest in the hands
of the Republican party. I think it
right to sketch the record of the Re
publican party for the last fifty years
and compare it with that of the Demo
cratic party now In session in Mis
souri and â¢ in that city la which the
VAX FLEET IS HUMOROUS.
Train of Thought Is Jocular and
Pleases Fancy of Auditors.
William Cary Van Fleet was the
next speaker. His line of talk was
largely in a jocular vein, which seem
ed to fully meet the train of thought
of his audience. He said in part:
"After this convention the Demo
cratic party will disappear forever
like foamy oceans of beer. Parker
represents the ideas of D. B. Hill. The
American nation *s the foremost In
the world to-day. As we stand now
we are emulated by the nations
abroad. The Japanese are shooting
American projectiles into the heart
of {he Russian bear. The Republicans
stand for the completion of the Pan
ama canal. No hopes are too high
for the Republican party. The Ameri
can Idea will be the uplifting idea of
this century. The Republican party
will continue to work out the splen
did destiny of this great republic."
The De Koven Glee Club followed
with some fine vocal selections.
SHORTRIDGE TALKS.
Speaker Tells of Good Performed by
the Republican Party.
Hon. Samuel M. Shortridge was in
troduced and said in part:
."I share in your impatience and join
in your desires to listen to that stal
wart Republican who has just return
ed from Chicafca with fresh laurels-
George A. Knight. Without arrogance
we can boast with the ancient Romans,
'To be an American, is better than to
be asking.' It was not always so v Once
we were poor and despised; to-day we
are rich and honored. Once we were
sneered at, but to-day all nations want
to waltz with Uncle Sam. To-day we
are materially majestic and territorial
ly we almost encompass the earth.
Once this starry banner was looked
down upon and had no standing on
earth. To-day it is recognized, as the
greatest emblem on earth. It now
floats proudly on distant shores and it
will stay where it is for the next four
years under the charge of that valiant
soldier and statesman, Theodore
Roosevelt.
"This nation is what it is to-day,
great and honored at home, loved and
feared abroad, by virtue of the pat
riotism and martyrdom of Republi
cans. It gathered to it the greatest
of men, that splendid being, that hope
ful, loving character, Abraham Lin
coln. From then until this hour the
party has furnished statesmenship to
make majestic the American people.
"I for one take unspeakable pride In
joining you In commemorating the
birth of the party and in ratifying the
nominations made at Chicago. The
great deeds of the party are associated
with the preservation of the Govern

tions recently made at the Republican
National Convention in Chicago. Our
friends the enemy, who are in session
to-day in St. Louis trying to' find a
safe and sane man to offer up as a sac
rifice upon the altar of the Republican
party, have said of the Republican Na
tional Convention that it was a cut
'and dried affair, without any interest
or enthusiasm; that it was a pro
gramme convention. My friends, it
was a programme convention, but it
was not a programme made by politi
cians or political bosses. It was not
a programme made by great corpora
tions or trust magnates. The people of
this land made the programme and the
convention obeyed the voice of the
people and renominated, as our candi
date for President, that scholar, states
man and author, that brave and gal
lant soldier, that loyal and patriotic
citizen, whose motto through life has
been that 'the voice of the people is
the voice of God,' that pure-minded,
honest, fearless and most perfect type
of American manhood, Theodore
Roosevelt of New York.
"But there is still another programme
that has been made by the American
people and that will be carried out as
sure as day follows night and night
follows day, and that is the election of
Roosevelt and Fairbanks td the high
offices of President and Vice President
respectively of the United States, in
November next by the largest popular
majority ever given to any candidates.
"But I am reminded of the fact that
my duty to-night is to preside and
not to talk and therefore I will con
clude with the hope that we may all
be inspired by what we shall hear
from the eloquent gentlemen who are
to address us and that we may go to
our honies determined to make a still
greater effort to perpetuate in power
that party which. hÂ»s done so much,
not alone for this nation but for all
humankind the world over."
The sweet, strains of "The Star-
Spangled Banner" floated through the
hair as the band at a sign from the
chairman begun the national anthem.
With one accord the audience arose
and joined their voices in singing' fhe
hymn that stirs every patriotic soul;

dents, the sole purpose of which has
been the betterment of the condition
of the American people, setting higher
the standard of civilization and opening
up to the American people new fields
of prosperity and effort. The Repub
lican party has been a party of action,
a party of deeds, not of words, a party
that has always built up and never
tern down, a party through whose ef
forts this nation has grown vigorous
and prospered until to-day it is the
greatest nation on the face of the
earth. It has won the confidence of
the people of this land, it has preserved
the integrity of this nation and won
the respect of all nations of the earth.
"It was the party of Abraham Lin
coln and it struck the shackles from
millions of slaves; It was the party of
Grant and it led the hosts of American
patriots to preserve this nation for the
destiny that Providence has in store
for it; It was the party of Blaine, that
stood for statesmanship of the highest
character and patriotism of the purest
type; it was the party of McKinley,
that stood for protection to American
industries and to American- labor, Mc-
Kinley, under whose leadership we be

striving for peace with honor, but pre
pared through our army and citizen
soldiers on land and our navy on the
sea to fight for what was deemed the
cause of right.
"History affords no parallel in any
age or country for the growth in na

for education in our common schools,
the high moral atmosphere pervading
all classes, the purity of the home life,
the possession of civil and religious

respected and ample employment' for
all who wanted work which have
marked the life of the American peo

SENATOR WOLFE'S ADDRESS.
Announces Object of Meeting and Ex
presses Patriotic Sentiments.
Patriotic citizens who failed to get
in the Alhambra Theater last night
certainly missed a treat in the way of
oratory and good music. Patriotism
predominated every moment of the
golden jubilee of the Republican
party. Every mention of the party's
standard bearers brought forth cheer
after cheer and each speech was ap
plauded to the echo.
"Old Glory" waved in every nook
and corner of the auditorium and at
each reference to its spangled folds
the audience voiced its appreciation
with cheers and prolonged applause.
Senator Edward I. Wolfe was in his
happiest mood and announced each
speaker in a catchy way. When he
called the meeting to order he stated
that he had been requested to act as
chairman owing to the absence of
General Stone, who was attending a
similar meeting in Los Angeles. Con
tinuing, he said:
"Ladies and Gentlemen and Fellow
Citizens: In the absence of General
Stone, the chairman of the Republi
can' State Central Committee, the
pleasant duty has been assigned to me
of presiding over this, the first Re
publican demonstration of this cam
paign. I bring to you. however, a
message from the chairman of the
State Central Committee and at his
request I deliver it to you. If you
love your party and desire to see it
triumphant at the coming election you
must register and you must see that
your friends and your neighbors and
your employes and your employers
register, for unless you do so you can
not vote at the coming election, and
the State of California and the city
of San Francisco in particular owes
so much to the Republican party that
it is only right and proper that on
next November it should roll ud for
our present standard bearer as hand
some a majority as it did four years
ago for our beloved, much lamented
and martyred President, William Mc-
Kinley.
OBJECTS OF MEETING.
"We have met here to-night, as they
are meeting all over this nation, for
a dual purpose: To commemorate the
fiftieth aninversary of the birth of the
Republican party and to ratify the
nominations recently made at the Re
publican National Convention at Chi
cago. We are celebrating to-night
what may be called the golden wed
ding of the American people to a great
political party; a union that has re
sulted in the greatest degree of pros
perity and national greatness and
brought complete happiness and con
tentment to millions of firesides In
this nation.

The name of Julius Kahn was greet
ed with cheers which were continued
some minutes after he walked to the
speaker's stand. He said:
"The Republican party stands for
progress. The best interests of the
commonwealth are vested In the Re
publican party.
â¢ "Champ Clark has stated that the
greatest calamity that has befallen the
American republic was the second elec
tion of Grover Cleveland. Yesterday at
the great convention in St. Louis, when
the name of Cleveland was mentioned
cheers rent the air for ten minutes. I
wonder how Bryan felt when he heard
this, surrounded by his Nebraska dele
gates?
"The Democrats don't care for a plat
form. What they want is a candidate

loaves and fishes. They have an or
ganized appetite. In their convention
they have attacked Mr. Root. They
seem to forget that during the regime
of the Republican party the public debt

fostered, the navy has been built up.

given to the Philippines, the Monroe

down to the present time, dwelling on
the civil" war and the stand taken by
the Democratic partv at that time.
"The Republican was the progressive
party during all those years while the
Democratic party was the t>arty of
obstruction. In all of the fifty years in
my observation it has kicked and
growled and opposed. It was for flat
moneyâ 16 to 1 and any old thing. ThÂ«
Republican party has stood for protec
tion and prosperity for the people.
When Cleveland was President you all
remember the soup houses. When tht
Spanish war threatened the Democratic
brethren stood as a unit and fought
for 'Old Glory' and the honor of the
nation. But when the war closed, they
vilified the administration. They even
adopted Aguinaldo as their hero. While
no doubt President McKinley suf
fered and worried over the criticism
heaped upon him, he stood firm, and
when he was taken from us Roosevelt
took up the work and stands firm to
day."
Portions of Roosevelt's speech at the
Philadelphia convention were quoted
and Dibble concluded:
"I believe this republic has been
bullded and set apart for the uplifting
of humanity. Where the Republican
party fifty years ago stood alone
against the slave power, so to-day it
stands alone for the upbuilding of hu
manity."

A vast audience, representing the
btst citizenship of San Francisco, as- |
: -rrabled early last evening at the Al
hambra Theater to commemorate the
fiftieth birthday of the Republican
party and to ratify the nominations of j
the Republican National Convention.
Bombs, skyrockets, marching clubs,
and the general paraphernalia of the
Â¦ Â¦rdinary political campaign were not
required to attract people to the Al
hambra. The announcements made in
the daily press of the city that a Joint
committee of the State League of Re
publican Clubs and the executive com- j
rnittee of the governing body of the j
5>arty had decided to ratify and cele- i
brate in San Francisco on Wednesday
evening, July 6, brought the people to
- â - _
gether. One bonfire blazed at the cor
ner of Eddy and Jones streets and a
band stationed there discoursed patri
otic music to indicate the $ace of
meeting. Before 8 o'clock the theater
was crowded on the main floor and in
the galleries to its utmost seating ca
pacity. Mechanics, professional men
and workers in every line of industry
joined in the demonstrations of ap
plause that hailed the mention of emi
nent leaders in the Republican party.
Between 8 and 9 o'clock hundreds seek
ing admission to the Alhambra were
turned away because the house was
packed to its limit.
PATRIOTIC SEXTIMEXTS.
Patriotism as exemplified in love J
of country, devotion to the flag and ;
assertion of American principles of j
progress was the dominating senti
ment of the occasion. When the band
gave the music of "The Star-tfpangled
Banner" the vast concourse of people
arose. The achievements of the army
and navy in the cause of human lib
erty and human progress were ac
claimed. In reviewing the great work
v.rought by the Republican party for
The country's good Fince the memor
able convention '"under the oaks" at
Jackson, Mich., on July 6. 1854, the
f=peakf-rs rendered eloquent tribute to
Abraham Lincoln, U. S. Grant, James
G. Blaine, William McKinley and
Theodore Roosevelt and the audience
responded with mighty demonstrations
of approval, renewed and prolonged.
In happy style the presiding officer
rpoke of the programme at the Chi
cago convention which was carried out
in the nomination of Theodore Roose
velt and impressed upon the audience
the significant fact that the pro
gramme was not made by Wall street,
the trusts, the corporations and the
political bosses, but was created by
the American people, arid the conven
tion in following it registered the will
of the people.
An incident of the meeting occurred
when George A. Knight took his seat
on the stage of the Alhambra. He
was recognized by the audience and
the applause was so pronounced and
prolonged that the orator was con
strained to arise and ackncivledge the
tribute to his voice and genius.
PEERLESS ORATOR.
Another remarkable demonstration
took place when the eloquent speaker
Samuel M. Shortridge was presented as
a Republican leader who had borne the
banner of his party in many political
campaigns and had received no other
reward than that which springs from
the consciousness that duty is per
formed. The people of San Fran
<Uco assembled in the , Alhambra
last evening gave the distinguished
arA polished orator such a recep
tion as they formerly gave to
the illustrious General W. H. L.
Barnes, whose many and noble efforts
in the service of his country and his
party received no other recognition
than that rendered by the homage of
his countrymen. Many in, the audi
ence last night recalled the fact that
Mr. Shortridge once aspired to repre-
Fent California in the Senate of the
United States, but the Legislature in
its wisdom or in its fancy gave
the Senatorial honors to a for
mer Governor of the State, George
C. Perkins of Alameda. It was viv
idly brought to the mind of many
last night that the peerless orator ac
cepted the reverse with serene and
patriotic complacency. He did not sulk
in his tent or seek solace in the camp
of his political adversaries. He went
forward to the duty of proclaiming the
virtues of Republican aspirants more
fortunate than himself until it was in
delibly inscribed on the records of the
campaign committee of the patty:
"Where Shortridge speaks, Republican
majorities grow."
Cordial greetings -were given to John
T. Dare. Julius Kahn. Henry C. Dibble
and Cary Van Fleet, and whenever the
name of Roosevelt was spoken the Re
publican hosts applauded in their
might.

A century Is but a moment of history: it

subject "The History of the Republican
Party in Michigan."
An interesting feature of the exer
cises was a body of "Fremont voters"
and men who cast their ballots for the
"Pathfinder," for whom a thousand
prominent scats had been reserved.
Grand Army uniforms, crutches and
Filvered locks were conspicuous among
them and the rapt attention of these
"charter" Republicans was notable.
When the morning exercises at the
grove were concluded the distinguished
guests were driven to the Hotel Ot
sego, where they were tendered a re
ception*. Then there was a hnlf-hour's
Interruption of the day's programme
for luncheon. In the afternoon the
programme at the, grove was resumed.
A tremendous audience was present
when Senator Burrows introduced Sec

of the afternoon. Secretary Hay said:
Thomas J. O'Brien of Grand Rapids,
the next speaker, .was introduced as
one of the participants in the original

Republican party, "under the oaks,"

It was not so easy fifty years ago to take
sides against the stave power as it may seem
to-day. Respect for the vested rights of the
Southern people was one of our moat sacred
traditions. It was founJed on the compromises
of the constitution, and upon a long line of
U-Kal and legislative precedents. The men of
the Revolution made no defense of slavery In
Itself; Washington. Adam*, Jefferson and
Franklin deplored its existence, but recosnlzed
the necessity of compromlf>e until the public
mind might rest In the hope of Its ultimata
extinction. Hut after they had panned away

very intrenched itself in every department of
our public lire. Its advocates dominated Con
gress and the State Legislatures: they even In
vaded the pulpit and grotesquely wrested a
few texts of Scripture to their \purpose. They
gave the tone to nociety; even the Southern
accent was imitated In our schools and col
leges. .*-..:.
If the slaveholders bad been content with
their unquestioned predominance, they might
for many years have controlled our polltlVl
and social wcrld. It was natural for the con
stivative people 'of the North to say: "We
deplore the existence of slavery, but we are
all to blame for it; we should not cast upon
our brethren in the South the burdens and
perils of Its abolition. \S'e must bear with the
unfortunate condition of things and take our
shtre of its Inconveniences." But the slave
holiiing party could not rest content. The an
cients raid that madness was the fate of those
Judged by the gods. Continual aggression is a
necessity of a false position. They felt In
stinctively that If their system were perma
nently to endure It must be extended, and to
at)sin this object they were ready to risk
everything. ThÂ»y rent In twain the compro
mises which had protected them so long. They
tcre down the bulwarks which had once re
stricted nnd defended them; and confiding In
their strength 'nnd our patience they boldly
announced and inaugurated the policy of the
Indefinite extension of their "peculiar Institu
tion."
MIGHTY CRY AGAINST SLAVERY.
Once embarked *apon this fatal enterprise
they left nothing undone which could contrib
ute to the catastrophe upon which they were
rushing. The Whig party had gone to ruin In
1852 on account of the impossibility of combhi-
Ing the scattered elements of opposition to the
party of pro-slavery aggression. but they
themselves furnished the weapon which was
to defertt them. In May. 1854, after several
months of passionate debate, to which the
country listened with feverish Interest, Con
gress passed the bill organizing the Territories
of Kansas and Nebraska.- omitting the restric
tions of the Missouri Compromise,-, which ex
cluded slavery from them. Thlsactlon at once
precipitated the floating anti-slavery sentiment
of the country-. A mighty cry of resolute In
d'jrnatlon arose from ' one end of the land to
the other. The hollow truce, founded upon the
legitimate compromises which had been ob

violated by the other, was at an end. lien

The Republican party had a noble origin.
It sprang directly from an aroused and In
dignant national , conscience. Questions of
finance, of political economy, of orderly ad
ministration, itftxsed out of sight for the mo
ment, to be taken up and dealt with later on.
But In 1S54 the question that brought the
thinking men together was whether there
should be a limit to the aggressions of slavery:

3 In the field of political discussion the most
dramatic Incident of the fight was the debate
between Lincoln and Douglas. Not many of
you saw that battle of the strong, where each
of the gladiators, htd an adversary worthy of
his steel, where the audiences were equally
divided, where tjie combatants . were fairly
matched In I debating skill and address, and
where the superiority of Lincoln was not so
much personal as It "wa* In the overwhelming

Inevitable. Douglas was re-elected to the Sen
ate but had gained also the resentful suspicion
of the South, which two years later disowned
him auJ defeated Ma lifelong ambition. Ua.
LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATE.
I have nti right to detain you at this hour in
recounting the history of those memorable days
Two incidents of the long battle will never be
forgotten. One was the physical and political
contest for the possession of Kansas, carried
on with desperate courage and recklessness of
consequences by the pro-slavery party on the one
Bide, and, on the other, by the New England
farmers whose weapons of aggression were
Bible texts and the words of Jefferson and
whose arms of defense were Sharpe'e 'rifles,
with words that ring even now when we read
them, like thÂ« clashing of swords, the Slave
State men claimed Kansas as their right and
the Free State men replied In the words of
the prophet before Herod. "It Is not lawful for
you to have her." And when the talking
sharpened to the physical clinch, the praying
men fought with the tame ferocity as the men
who cursed.
Only among the more obscure and ardent
members of the party was there any demand
for the abolition of slavery, but the whole
party stood like a rock for the principle that
the damnable Institution must be content with
what it had already got. and must not be al
lowed to pollute another Inch of free soil.
On thi* Impregnable, ground they made their
stand; and the mass convention which asFeni
blfd here In 1S5Â», while the vibrations, of tho
thunder of the guns and the nboutlngs of the
birthday of liberty yet lingered In the air, gave
a nucl'.-UB and a name to the new party, der
tlned to a great and beneficent career. Before
the month ended, the antl-siavery men of five
more great States adopted the nnme "Repub
lican." and under that banner Conjrrers was
carried and two years later a national party
assembled at I'ittsburK and nominated Fremont
and Dayton, who failed by a few votes of
sweeping the North.
Who of us that was living then will ever
forget the ardent enthusiasm of those days?
It was one of thoee, periods, rare In the life oj
any nation, when men forget themselves and.
in *rlte of habit, of Interest and of prejudice,
follow their consciences wherever \hey may
lead. In the clear; keen air that was abroad
the best men in the country drew des^per
breaths and rose to a moral height they had
not before attained. The movement was uni
versal. Sumner in the East, Seward in New
York; Chase In Ohio, Hates In Missouri, Blair
in Maryland, all sent forth their Identical ap
peal to the higher motive; and In Illinois
where the most popular man In the Statn
boldly and cynically announced. '-I don't caro
whether slavery Is voted up or voted 'down " a
voice, new to the nation, replied. "Thereare. some
of us who do care. If slavery is not wrong
nothing is wron?"â and Abraham Lincoln came
upon the field not to leave It until he was
triumphant In death.
Yet the most wondertul feature of that ex
traordinary campaign which then began, and
which never ceased until the land was purged
of Its deadly sin, was that even In the very
"tempest and whirlwind of their passion" the
great leaders of the Republican party kept
their agitation strictly within the limits of
the constitution and tho law. There was no
general demand for even an amendment to the
organic instrument. They pleaded for the re
peal of unjust statutes as inconsistent with
the constitution, but did not advocate their
violation.

\a t me hurriedly enumerate a few of th->
events in the long and fruitful career of the
Republican p.irty which *eem to us to entitle
It to the confidence of the country and the
flnnl approval of history. After the war was
ended and poace re-established with no dam
age to the structure of the Government, but
on thÂ« contrary, with added strength and' with
Increased guaranties of it* perpetuity it re
mained to h" shown whether the power and
Â»uceeÂ«a of the Republican party were to be
permanent, or' wh-Uher. born of a crisis It
was fitted to cope with the problems of dally
national life. It had destroyed slavery or
perhaps wo might better say. It had\ created
tnÂ» conditions by which slavery had committed
Filicide. In thÂ« absence of this great advprsary
could the party hoM together against the
thousand lesser evils that beset the public life
of modern peoples â the evils of Ignorance cor
ruption, avarice, and lavrlessiHss. the preju
dices of race and of class, the voices of dema
gogues, the cunning of dishonest craft, the
brutal tyranny of the boss, the venality of
the mean? I think It is not too much to nay
that tho last forty years have given an answer,
full of glory and honor, to that question.
REPUBLICAN* PARTY'S RECORD.
DAWN" OF PEACE.
"Abraham Lincoln, the honest man. Waged
war. Abollfht-d slavery. Twice elected Presi
dent without veiling tho fac* of liberty." This
was an achievement new to the world: that a
man and a party, armed with an authority so
unqupoticned -inrt so stupendous, in the very
current of a vast war, should have submitted
themselvw so rigidly to the lawâ and never
have dreamed there was anything meritorious
abrtut it. Then, If never before, we proved
we wore as fit to be free as the men who
achieved our freedem.
But we who have always tried to walk In
the marl he pointed out cannot be deprived of
the tender pride of calling ourselves his disci
ples, and of doing In his name the work allot
ted to us by Providence. And I hope I am vio
lating neither the confidence of a friend nor
the prcprleties of an occasion like this when I
refer to thÂ«? arient and able young statesman
who is now. and Is to be. our President to let
you know that In times of doubt and difficulty
thÂ« thought cftenest In his heart Is, "What, in
such a case, would Lincoln have done?"
As we are removed farther and farther from
the founders of our party and their mighty
work, their names and their fame rise every
year higher in the great perspective of his
tory. The clamor of hatred and calumny dies
awb>\ The efforts made to weaken the hands
of Lincoln and his associates are forgotten.
ThÂ» survivors of those who so bitterly at
tacked him and his cause, which was the
cauÂ»e of the country, are now themselves as
tonished when confronted with the words they
then uttered. But It was against a political
opposition not less formidable and efficient
than the armed force beyond the Potomac that
the Union men of that day. and their Presi
dent, had to struggle. It was not merely the
looses in battle, the waste of our wealth, the
precious blood of our young men. that filled
Lincoln's heart with anguish and made htm
old before his time, but it was the storm of
partisan hostility that raged against him. fill-
Ing the atr with slanders and thwarting his
most earnest and upselflsh efforts for the
country's sood. Hut In spite of it all he per
severed, never for a moment tempted by the
vast power he wielded to any action not Justi
fied by the moral and organic law. I have al

coin . became at once the foremost Republican
of the West and a little later the greatest
political figure of the century.
If there is one thing more than another In
which we Republicans are entitled to a legiti
mate pride it Is that Lincoln was our first
President; that we believed In him. loyally
supported him while he lived, and that we have
never lost the right to call ourselves his follow
era. There is not a principle avowed by the
Republican party to-day which is out of har
mony with his teachings or Inconsistent with
his character. "We do not object to our oppo
nents quoting him, praising him â even claim
ing him as their own. If It Is not sincere. It is
still a laudable tribute to acknowledged excel
lence. If it is genuine. It is still better, for
even a Nebraska Populist who reads his Lin
coln Is in the way of salvation. But only
those who belie\-e In human rights and are
willing to make sacrifices to defend them; who
believe in the nation and its beneficent power;
who believe In the American system of pro
tecticn championed by a long line of our great
est and best, running back from McKinley to
Washington, and, as Senator Dolliver so truth
fully said, "to the original sources of American
common sense;" only those Vho believe in
equal Justice to labor and capital; In honest
money and the right to earn it, have any title
to name themselves by the name of Lincoln or
to claim a moral kinship with that august and
venerated spirit.' I admit it would be little
less than sacrilego to try to trade upon that
benignant renown, whose light "folds In this
orb o" the earth."
The chief oration of the evening was
that delivered by Oscar Lawler of Los
Angeles, whose subject was "From
Lincoln to Roosevelt.','
At ter the programme had been com
pleted the distinguished visitors and
other prominent members of the party
held an impromptu reception and It
was midnight before the banqueters
left the pavilion
Senator Bard's snWect was "Repub
licans Looking Westward." He spoke
briefly but eloquently of the high place
the Western States have taken in the
list of Republican commonwealths and
how by reason of the growing impor
tance of the Pacific Coast the Eastern
leaders of the party would always look
to this part of the country to do its full
duty to the party and thereby to the
country.
"Why California Is Republican" was
the subject of an able speech by Con
gressman James McLachlan. He was
followed by Henry E. Oxnard, who
spoke on the subject, "The Republican
Platform tÂ»f 1904." His speech was ex
temporaneous and less than ten min
utes In length. Taking up the leading
planks in the Republican declaration
or principles Oxnard argued that they
were a safe gauge by which the coun
try could measure the purpose of the
party. He considered the platform a
model of Us kind, a declaration which
every Republican could stand upon and
fight for, and something which would
give to "the people at large renewed
confidence in the party, because they
would know that Republican pledges
are not made to be broken.
The presence of both Senator Thomas
R. Bard and Henry T. Oxnard at the
speakers' table added interest to the
occasion, for the names of both will be
presented at the next session of the
Legislature as candidates for the Sen
atorship. If any of the 3000 people
present expected either of them to re
fer even remotely to the contest now
on between them they were doomed to
disappointment. The banquet was not
marred by reference to personal aspi
rations, but in a dignified. manner both
gentlemen confined themselves to
praise of the party .and the achieve
ments of the Republican leaders rather
than referring to merely local matters.
Senator George C. Perkins' subject
was "Early Days of the Republican
Party In California," and his speech was
replete with reminiscences of the early
days in this State. He told of the little
handful of men who, when the party
came into being, started the movement
which made California a Republican
State. She has deviated at times from
tho straight course, but the speaker
asserted there was never a time when
California was not really a Republican
State and predicted that she would al
ways remain so.
He told, interestingly, of the early
struggles of the party, the trouble with
the copper-heads during the war and
spoke familiarly of men whose names
adorn the country's history.
SENATORS GIVE ADDRESSES.
Buchanan is probably the oldest Re
publican in Southern California. He
corrected the impression that he was
present at the birth of the party. He
stated that he was one of the men who
organized the party in the State of
Indiana, but . the Indiana convention
didn't meet until after the Republican
party had been organized elsewhere.
At the time the party was organized
in Indiana Buchanan was a member
of the Hoosier State Legislature, and
when the movement toward Republi
canism swept into the country in 1855
all prominent fusionists in Indiana were
called together in Indianapolis and
voted to affiliate themselves with the
new Republican party. Since that time
Buchanan has voted for eleven Repub
lican Presidential candidates and has
been a member of the party for .forty
eight years.
"Recollection of the Early Conven
tions" was the subject of an address
by J. A. Buchanan c* Pasadena, one
of the early leaders of the party In the
Middle West.
.had attended many political gatherings,
but none at which there was such a
showing for such an occasion. The
i State, he said, expects Los Angeles
County and Southem>yCallfornla to do
her duty and had no fears of what
the result would be. He considered a
sweeping victory for the Republican
ticket in this State next November at
a majority which would establish a
new record.
"Theodore Roosevelt, with a wis
dom and Judgment far beyond his
years, recognizing all the difficulties of
the situation, immediately upon tak
ing his oath of office made the one
declaration of all others calculated to
avoid Business complications, financial
anxiety and political uneasiness, and
that was that the plans and purposes
of President McKinley should be car
ried out to the end in the very spirit
as that in which they were conceived.
This declaration brought back con
fidence and allayed fear and placed
President Roosevelt at once in his
rightful possession, that of one of the
great Presidents of the republic, and
leader of the Republican party. As it
were, he had the interests of the na
tion steady with one hand, leaving the
other free to grapple with new prob
lems and responsibilities."
The speaker said It needed such a
strong, resolute business man as Pres
ident Roosevelt to bring to a conclusion
the legislation and negotiations over
the isthmian canal and to overcome the
Intrigues of adverse Interests, both in
the United States and in the State of
Colombia. McKinlay numbered amon,'
other recent achievements the laying
of the Pacific cable, by private enter
prise, it is true, but enterprise hastened
by Congressional bills contemplating
such a cable. Progress has been madu
I under Roosevelt toward the building of
a merchant marine. He characterized
as a signal triumph for American diplo
macy the note of Secretary Hay defin
ing the relationship of nations border-
Ing on the Pacific.
PARTY'S GREAT RECORD.
Continuing. McKinlay said: "Cuba
has been turned over to her own Gov
ernment and treaties of trade and al
liance have been made between that
new reoublfc and the United States
which will be advantageous to both
countries.
"Porto Rico has been firmly estab
lished on her new Governmental basis
and is rapidly becoming not only pros
perous, but affluent.
"The Philippine insurrection ha-s been

"ThÂ«Â» navy has been tremendously In
creased under President Roosevelt.
There have been completed in the last
four years five battleships, four cruis

SACRAMENTO. July Â«.â The Re
publicans of this city ratified the nom
ination of Roosevelt and Fairbanks
and celebrated the fiftieth anniversary
of the birth of the party to-night with
demonstration and meeting at Cap
itol Park, in which thousands Joined.
The orator for the occasion was Hon.
Duncan McKinlay of San Francisco,
whose tribute to the Republican lead
ers aroused great enthusiasm. Other
speakers were Superior Judge E. C.
Hart, Senator R. T. Devlin. Joseph
Steffens and A. L. Hart Jr.
Duncan McKinlay was escorted to
the Capitol from the Golden Eagle
Hotel by the various uniformed Re
publican clubs, headed by a band and
carrying torches. Scenes of enthusi
asm marked the route to the scene of
the open air meeting at the park,
where a vast crowd had assembled.
McKinlay dwelt at length upon the
last speech of the late President Wil
liam McKinley, delivered at Buffalo
shortly before his assassiation, and
spoke of it as matching Washington's
farewell address and Monroe's Im
mortal pronouncement of the inviola
bility of every foot of American soil
from foreign conquest. Referring to
the shock which the country experi
enced upon President McKlnley's
death, the speaker said:
D. E. 3IcKINlu\Y SPEAKS.
In a five-minute speech prior to the
introduction of the other speakers Gen
eral George H. Stone complimented the
Republicans of Los Angeles County
Upon their snlendid organization and
upon the fact that during the past two
years the Republican clubs have
maintained headquarters and have
worked steadily despite the fact that
there was no contest on. He said he
SPEECHES ARK ELOQUENT.
The pavilion had been transformed
into a place of beauty. Every square
foot of the woodwork was covered with
bunting, and hundreds of flags were
draped around large pictures of fa
mous Republicans. The theme of the
â¢ventng, the keynote of the celebration,
was contained in the legend, "From
LJncoln to Roosevelt." which appeared
in flaming letters abo\-e the speakers'
Ktar.d, and at either end of it were pic
tures of the two great Republicans.
That over the proscenium was supple
mented with an artistic valance bear-
Ing the legend, "Progress, Peace, Pros
perity." Pictures of all the Republican
Presidents appeared at either side of
the motto. Across the entire width
of the platform was the speak
er's table and behind It at right
angles were six tables at which
were seated members of the reception
committee. A score or more of long ta
bles accommodated the other banquet
ens. The guests of the Republican
League assembled at 7:20 o'clock and
shortly after 8 o'clock the signal was
given and they repaired to their places
on the main floor.
It was nearly 8:30 o'clock when Gen
r-ral Stone, chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee, was Intro
duced as toaetmaster. Then an
elaborate menu, one fit for a dinner
party in a fashionable club, was dis
coursed and for an hour the banquet
er* enjoyed the repast Then the
speeches began, and with them the
enthusiasm of the audience manifested
Itself. Each of the speakers was greeted
with cheers and accorded all the at
tention that any speaker could ask.
The mention of names dear to the
hearts of Republicans was greeted with
applause. Perhaps nothing new was
told by the speakers, but they told
what they had to say in an eloquent
manner and awakened a degree of en
thusiasm that gives promise of a more
phenomenal Republican majority In
Los Angeles County this year than that
given the party ticket two years ago.
It is the purpose of the party leader*
in thi3 county to extend their already
extensive organization, which has been
maintained for two years, and the sen
timent expressed by the visitors who
ncted the enthusiasm to-night was that
Los Angeles County will keep the Re
publican banner this year.
LINCOLN' TO ROOSEVELT.
In keeping with this sentiment sev
eral w'-ll' known Democrats participat
ed in to-night's celebration, not as
Democrats, but as American citizens
who could conscientiously applaud
the achievements of Loncoln, Grant,
â¢iarSeld. McKinley and Roosevelt. It
was a kappy occasion unmarred by
any untoward incident and those who
came from a distance expressed them
selves after it was over as being
amazed that such a function could
have been eo delightfully given with
out the slightest confusion other than
that which always accompanies the
meeting of so large a body of men.
Months ego Postmaster Motley H.
Flint conceived the idea of opening
the campaign in Southern California
with a banquet at which one thousand
covers were to be laid. The birthday of
the Republican party was chosen at
the date'and with a committee of his
own selection from the Republican
League Postmaster Flint went to work.
There was practically a unanimous re
sponse from the Republicans of this
city when he publicly announced the
project. Invitations were sent broad
cast over the State and numerous fa
vorable replies were received.
In this city there was such a demand
for tickets that the original issue of
1000 was quickly taken up and the num
ber had to be increased to 1500. This,
too, would have been increased hc^l it
not been that the number taxed the
capacity of the main floor of Hazard Pa
vilion, where the banquet was held. To
iiight when the doors were opened only
the holders of tickets were admitted
to the main floor, but the two lirrs

LOS ANGELES, July 6. â Nowhere
in the country, except, of course, at
JackÂ«on, Mich., was the fiftieth anni
versary of the organization of the Re
publican party celebrated in a more
elaborate manner than in Los Ange
les. There have b*Â»en many notable
political events in this city and in
this cad of the Ftate, but to-night's
celebration eclipsed anything of the
kind ever before attempted here.
For two days Los Angles has been
the Republican Mecca for California
members of the party and from all
over the State came men prominent
in every calling to participate in a
banquet, the equal of which as a po
litical feast has seldom been equaled
in this section of the country. Nor
did the event partake wholly of a po
litical color. In a broader sense it
was more patriotic than political; a
sounding of the praises of past and
present Republican leaders, not whol
ly because they were Republicans, but
more because they were statesmen and
patriots.

thal, the retiring County Treasurer,
and a long established shoe dealer of
Heppner, opened his store as usual
this morning. He returned home soon,
but went back to the store, this time
to get his revolver.
Reaching home, he went at once to
his room. Just as his wife entered he
had removed his coat, vest and shoes.
He held the pistol in his hand Mrs.
Lichtenthal became alarmed and tried
to wrest it from him. She was ordered
from the room, but just as she reached
the outside door her husband shot
himself and never recovered conscious
ness, dying at noon.
His defeat for his fourth successive
term as County Treasurer is supposed
to have caused Lichtenthal excessive
worry. He was about to turn over the
funds to his successor, but this will not
be done until an investigation is made.
Every indication is that his accounts
were perfectly straight.

CZAR DECIDES
ON PUNISHMENT
ROOSEVELT AS THE ISSUE.
We could desire no better fortune, in the
campaign upon which we are entering, than
that the other side should persist In their an
nounced intention to make the issue upon
President Roosevelt. What a godsend to our
orators'. It takes some study, some research,
to talk about the tariff, or the currency, or
'foreign policy. But to talk about Roosevelt!
it is as easy as to sing "the glory of the
Graeme." Of gentle birth and breeding, yet
a man of the people in the best sÂ«nse; with
the training of a scholar and the breezy acces
sibility of a ranchman;! a man of the library
and a man of the world; an athlete and a.
thinker; a soldier and a statesman; a reader,
a writer, and a mak*r of history; with the
sensibility of a poet and the steel nerve of a
rough rider; one who never did,, and never
could, turn his back on a friend or an enemy.
A man whose merits are bo great that he
could win on his merits alone; whose person
ality Is so engaging that you lose sight of his
merits. Make their fight on a man like that!
What Irreverent caricaturist was It that called
them the stupid party?
In our candidate for the VieÂ« Presidency we
have tone back to the old and commendable
custom of the republic and have nominated a
man in every way fit for the highest place In
the nation, who will bring to the Presidency of
the Senate an ability and experience rarely
equaled In itÂ» history.
I have detained you too long; yet as I close
I want to say a word to the young men whoso
political life is beginning. Any one entering
business would be triad of the chance to be
come one of an established firm with years
of success behind It. with a wide connection,
with unblemished character, with credit found
ed on a rock. How Infinitely brighter the fu
ture when the creeent Is so sure the past ao
glorious. Everything great done by this coun
try In the last fifty years has been done under
the auspices of the Republican party. la not
this consciousness a great asset to have in
your mind and memory T As a mere item of
personal comfort is It not worth having? Un
coln and Grant, Hayes and Garfield, Harrison
end McKinley â names secure In the heaven of
fame â they all are gone, leaving small estates
In worldly goods, but what vast possessions
in ' principles, memories, sacred associations!
It Is a etart In life to share that wealth. .Who
now boasts that he oppos-d Lincoln? who
brags of his voting against Grant? though
both acts may have been from the best of
motives.
THE PARTY THAT DOES THINGS.
In our form of government ther.e must be
two parties, and tradition, circumstances, tem
perament, will always create a sufficient oppo
sition. But what young man would not rather
belong to the party that does thlnrs. Instead
of one that opposes them; to the party that
looks up, rather than down; to the narty of
the dawn, rather than of the sunsÂ«t? For fifty
years the Republican party has believed In.
the country ar.d labored for it in hope and joy;
It has revenged the flag and followed it; has
carried it under strange vkles and planted it
on (ar-recedlng horizons. It has seen the na
tion grow greater every year and more re
spected; by Just dealing, by intelligent labor,
by a genius for enterprise, it has seen the
country extend its intercourse and its Influence
to regions unknown to our fathers. Tet it has
never abated one Jot or tittle- of the ancient
law lmDOsed on us by our God-fearlnjr ances
tors. JVe have fought a good fight, but also
we bsrve kept the faith. The constitution of
cur fathers has befn the' light to our feet; our
path Is. and will ever remain, that of ordered
progress, of liberty under the law. The coun
try has vastly Increased^ but the great-brained
statesmen who preceded us provided for infinite
growth. The discoveries of science have made
miraculous additions to our knowledge. But
we are not daunted by progress; we are not
afraid of the light. The fabric our fathers
builded on such sure foundations will stand
all shocks of fate or fortune. There will ai
ways be a proud pleasure In looking back on
the history they made; but. guided by their
example, the cominB generation has the right
to anticipate work not less Important, days
equally memorable to mankind. We who are
passing oft the stage bid you, as the children
of Israel encamping by the sea were bidden,
to to forward; we whose hands can ao longer
hold the flaming torch pass it on to you that
its clear light may show the truth to the ages
that are to come.
SENATOR FAIRBANKS SPEAKS.
Senator Fairbanks of Indiana was the
But there has bÂ«en more noise made over
his suddenness on the Isthmus of Panama than
elsewhere. It la difficult to treat this charge
â¢with seriousness. The President had made a
treaty with Colombia at her own, soliciation,
Â¦which was Infinitely to her advantage, to in
augurate an enterprise which was to be for
the benefit of the world. He waited with end
lass patience* while Bogota delayed and trifled
vrlth the matter, and finally rejected It, and
suggested new negotiations for a larger sum.
Panama, outraged by this climax of the wrongs
8ho had already suffered, declared and estab
lished her independence. The President, follow
ing an unbroken line of precedents, entered Into
relations with the new republic, and. â¢ obeying
his duty to protect the transit of the Isthmus
as all other Presidents had done before him,
gave orders that there should be no bloodshed
on the line of the railway. He said, like
Grant "Let us tiave peace," and we had It.
It will seem Incredible to posterity that any
American could have objected to this. He
acted wisely and benffloently, and all somÂ«
people can find to criticize In his action Is that
he wa* too brisk about It. If a thing is right
and proper to do. it docs not make It criminal
to do it promptly. J>o, gentlemen! That was
a time when the hour and the man arrived,
together. He struck while the iron was white
hot on the anvil of opportunity and forged as
perfect a bit of honest statecraft as this gen
eration has seen.
'MERGER SUITS.
And as to the merger suits, now that people
have come to their senses they see that his ac
tion in that case was as regular aa the equi
nox. He was Informed through legal channels
that a statute had been violated. He did not
make the statute, but be was bound by his
oath to execute it. He brought the proceed
ing which It was his duty to bring. The
courts, Irora the lowest to the highest, eus
talned his action. He did what It would have
lx>en a high mlsdemesnor not to have done.
The Iaw9 in this country are made to be
obeyed, whether it is safe or not. It Is al
ways unsafe to disobey them.
Such a man Is our President and our candi
date. He Is prompt and energetic, but he
takes Infinite tains to set at the facts before
he acts. In all the crises In which he, has been
accused of undue haste, his action has been the
result of long meditation and well-reasoned
conviction. If he thinks rapidly. . that 1Â« no
fault; he thinks thoroughly, and that la the
pÂ«sentlal. When he- made peace between the
miners and operators. It was no sudden caprice
but the fruit of serious reflection, and this
act of mingled philanthropy and common erase
was Junlfled by a great practical result. When
he proclaimed anew the Monroe doctrine in
the Venezuela case his action was followed by
the most exDliclt acceptance of that saving
policy which has ever come to us from over
seas. He acted vfry swiitly. It is true, in
Mississippi, when the best citizens of a town
threatened the life of a postmistress for no
fault but her- color. He simply Bold. "Very
well, gentlemen : you may get your letter,
somewhere pise for a while."

-In view of the approaching primary
election to be held on August 9 and the
Presidential election on November 8, It
was thought that the first day of the
precinct registration would bring out a
large number of citizens who had failed
to register, but returns received by the
Registrar of "Voters from 282 out of 320
precincts show that but 2878 voters
: availed themselves of the privilege. As
the registration averaged about ten
votes to a precinct the returns for yes
terday will exceed 3000 when all reports
have been received. The precinct regis
tration for the first day in 1902 was
6165. -
Two years ago 21,573 voters were reg- j
istered before the precinct registration !
and this year 39,166 had been entered
on the register up to Tuesday night. It j
Is anticipated by the Election Commls- j
slon that the registration this year will j
exceed 83,000, With yesterday's regis
tration about one-half of the voters of j
the city have complied with the law re
quiring them to register this year re- !
gardless of any previous registration. ;
Following Is the registration yesterday
by Assembly districts:
Twenty-eighth, 170; Twenty-ninth,
215; Thirtieth. 171; Thirty-first, 183;
Thirty-second, 244; Thirty-third, 164;

This is the last day of the precinct

to get their names on the\ voting lists
without the trouble of a trip to the

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION NEWS.
The contest for United States Senator
to succeed Thomas R. Bard is to be
enlivened by the Introduction of a nevÂ»
candidate in the person of George A.
Knight of San Francisco. It is com
mon gossip in political circles that
State Senators W. C. Ralston of Cala
veras and Frank W, Leavltt of Ala
rneda are r/tady to give Knight their
earnest support. It is expected that
Thomas H. Selvage of Humboldt, who
Is slated for another term in the upper
house of the State Legislature, will
Join the Knight forces.-
Reports are coming from the south to
the effect that Bard Is making con
siderable progress as a candidate for
re-election. . The belief is entertained
by several of the northern statesmen
that Oxnard cannot cope with Bard,
hence the agitation In favor of Knight.
When the suggestion of entering the
contest was presented to Knight he
remarked that he 'would not allow his
name to go before the Legislature if
his candidacy was not entirely accept
able to the senior United States Sen
ator, George C. Perkins. It was pos
itively stated yesterday by a State
Senator from the Interior that Perkins
would not interpose the slightest ob
stacle to Knight's candidacy.
"The Republican party Is the great
est union labor party that was ever
known to man. America wants and
welcomes all law-abiding citizens who
love and honor the Stars and Stripes
to take shelter beneath its glorious
folds. Let us labor to the end' that the
great Union, assisted by the Republican
party,*shall Increase and continue to
glorify the grandeur of Its ideas and
its purposes."
"The Democratic party Is like a
snake. It sheds its skin and keeps its
fangs. Bryan Is a snare drum. The
Republicans are united. They cannot
afford to take a backward step. "We
are now a nation of 80,000,000 people
and where on the face of this earth
are a people so well clothed, so well
fed and so free as we are?
. "When you come to the Socialist, all
I have to say about those who stand
on the streets and talk is they simply
give out wind puddings instead of
work.
Knight Speaks as Citizen of California
for Good of State.
George A. Knight, as he stepped up
to the rostrum, was received with a
thunderous ovation. He said in part:
" 'Mid pleasures and palaces though
we may roam.
Be it ever so humble, there is no place
like home.
"I speak to you not as a representa
tive of the Republican party, but as a
citizen of California; a citizen who
speaks in behalf of the best interests
and for the greatest welfare of this
State. This State has won high honors
abroad for its strong principles, and
we want to stand for those same high
principles now.
"I left honored when I was sent to
confer with the nation's leaders, and I
want tÂ« express my gratitude to the
press for the kindness and considera
tion it has ever shown to me. "^
"California has been well treated
abroad and she has always treated
those from abroad well when they have
come within the limits of her bound
aries. California is proud of her posi
tion in the Union and she has cause
to be. May that pride still keep her to
the front and may she still adhere to
those principles . of the Republican
party that have made' her what she is.
"At the great Republican convention
held in the Coliseum in Chicago di
rectly over the speaker's desk was a
great painting twelve feet high by ten
feet wide. It was a portrait of Senator
Mark Hanna. (Great applause.) All
factions of the Republican party ac
cepted it. You all know the great
spirit of unanimity that prevailed at
that convention when the representa
tives of this nation nominated Theodore
Roosevelt as the leader of the party
that shall still continue to protect the
interests of the country In the future
as it has done In the past.
"Rooevolt was nominated a year be
fore the convention met. Roosevelt is
no false quantity. He is a fearless,
bold, aggressive, strong, American. He
does not care a tinker's damn for a dem
agogue. He has always kept the
pledges framed for this country by the
late lamented McKinley.
"The spectacle at St. Louis, at the
present time is a lamentable one. J. S.
"Williams is fighting for a lost cause.
His great burst of spleen there was an
attempt to cut Root's speech Into rib
bons. Root Is only a soldier In the
ranks. 1 ' He is surely the victim of an
assault. Williams Is throwing spit
balls at the Republican party. His
views are the kind that murdered
Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln fell, but his
Ideas and principles only arose re
splendent with glory. The lame Ideas
are those that shot Garfield and mur
dered the great McKinleyâ McKlnley
from whose death came a study of life
and honor that ' will live triumphant
forever.

PREDOMINANT PACIFIC POWER,
I will r.pt at this moment speak of the lm
rortaat acculsitlone of territory wÂ« have, made,
which render us in inany ways the predoml
rant Dower In the Pacific. But out of the
territory we already poeeesÂ»ed, fourteen new
Utate* have entered the Union. The census
of lbSO gave us 23.000,000 of population â the
last cae. 76.000 000. The number of our farms
â the total of bur cultivated acreage â ha* ln
rreaa'd fourfold. Our corn crcD Is five times

The real and personal wealth of the country

â¢even thousand milllcr? to ninety-four thou

a mileage of 10.000 to one of 300.000. Our
imports and exports have gone up by leaps

ir.atd a premium in all markets â no other
country on earth can Fay us much. We paid
abroad the other day $5<>.000,000 of gold in a
Finsle transaction without producing a ripple
in exchange. The vast expenditure made i.<-e
eM>ary by our enormous increase in every ele
xner.t of national growth Is collected with the
utmost ease and exi>ended with perfect hon
*-siy. Our protective system, loyally and in
telligently carried out and improved tn the
last seven years, not only fills our Treasury
Â¦with the means of national expenditure, but
liiLS carried our industries and our commeroe
to a height of prosperity which la the wonder
and envy of our neighbors. Â»Bo are trying to

ing an Ssttre'.an canal, was a part of the same
general plan of opening a field of enterprise
In those distant rerlons where the Far West

met In the moet frank and friendly spirit

natter of the Alaskan boundary, which was

rreat Pacific possession.
PANA3IA CANAL TREATY.
And to clot* this record of success â mo- !
notonous because gained by appeals to reason '
rather than force, without parade or rr.elo- !
drama â came the treaty with Panama, by
t. hich we finally gained the pathway across
the isthmus by a perpetual grant. Insuring the
construction of an American canal under
American control, built primarily for Amer
ican needs, but open on equal terms to all ,
the p*op'-Â« of good will the world over.
All the foreign policy of McKlnley and
Koosevelt has been marked with the same
ttamp of honesty ana fair dealing, confessedly

Â¦with equity and consideration. They have
made more treaties than any two preceding
rreslflents; and the conclusion of the whole
matter U that we stand to-day In Independent
though amicable relations to all the rest of
the world â without an ally and without an
enemy.
If th* Government for the last seren years

resolved that they would wear home

Republican party. It showed them that

of the Issues at stake.

result.
REPUBLICS FAITHFUL- SERVANTS
The republic never Is In default of men to
â¢erre It worthily when the chief of the state
Is honest and able; when he has the eye and
tht will to choose the best men and will be
satisfied with no lees. So In Cuba, Porto
Rico and the Philippines we cot the best we
had. Wood. Allen and Hunt and Taft have
each In his place wrought a great work and
gained a righteous fame. Cuba and Porto
1 Rico are free and enjoying â the one under her
own banner, the other under the Stars and
Stripes â a degree of prosperity and happiness
never known before In all their troubled story.
As to the Philippines, the work done there
by Judge Taft and his associates will rank
among the highest achievements of colonial
administration recorded In history. Never
since their discovery has there been such
general peace and order; so thorough a pro
tection of the peaceable and restraint of evil
doers; so wide a diffusion of education; so
complete a guaranty to industry of the fruit
of Its labors. , -And when they see this energetic
and efficient 'government carried on, free from
tb* venality and bribery which formerly
seemed to them a necessity of existence, then.
Indeed, they are like them that dream. The
principal evil from which they still suffer
hs* its origin here. Some . well-meaning peo
ple â and others not so well meaning â are con
stantly persuading them that they are op
pressed and that they will be given their
liberty, as they choose to call It, as soon as
the Republican party is overthrown in this
country. These are the true enemies of the
Filipinos and not the men who are striving
with whole-hearted energy and with consum
mate success to ameliorate their condition and
to make them fit for self-government and all
its attendant advantages. The so-called anti
lmperlallsts confound in their daily speeches
and writings two absolutely unrelated Ideas â
the liberty, the civil rights, the self-govern
ment which we have given the Filipinos and
the Independence which the best of them do
not want and know they are unable to main
tain. To abandon them now, to cast them
adrift at the mercy of accident, would be an
act of cowardice and treachery which would
gala us the scorn and reproach of civilization.
PATRIOTIC DEMOCRATS.
Our opponents sometimes say we have no
right to claim the credit of the great deeds of
the last half century â that we could not have
accomplished them without the aid of Demo
crat*. Nothing truer was ever said; and it is
oa* of the chief glories of our annals and It
forms the eurest foundation of our hopes for
the future. The principles upon* which our
party Is built are eo sound, they have so Irre
sistible an attraction to patriotic and fair
minded men, thit whenever a time of crisis
comes when the national welfare is clearly at
stake, when vo'.ers must decide whether they
shall follow their prejudices or their con
scl?nces, we draw from other parties their best
men by thousand*.
Bright among the brightest cf those who
founded our party shine the names of Demo
crats; and when the war came on. the picked
men of that party rallied to the colors. Doug
las, shortly before he died, declared his unfal
tering support of Uncoln. The sun would go
down before I could rame the Democrats who
fought like heroes for the country. Grant,
Sherman, Sheridan, Dix. Sickles, Logan â In
dhort. an innumerable host. Democrats all,
rushed Into the field and thereafter fought and
worked with the Republicans while life lasJvd.
And that vast majority of Lincoln's in 1S64
would have been impossible had not myriads
of Democrats, casting their Hie-long associa
tions to thÂ» winds, listened to the Inward
monitor which paid. "Choose ye this day
when ye will serve." As it was then, so It
has been in after years. When the attempt
was made to repudiate, in whole or In part,
the national debt; or to abolish the 6ystem of
protection to American Industries, founded by
Washington and Hamilton and approved by
the experience of a hundred years; or to de
grade our currency at the demand of mere Ig
norance and greed â in all these cases we saw
the proof of the homely adage that you may
lead a horse to the water but may not make
him drink. In spite of organizations and plat
forms, in spite of the frantic adjurations cf
gifted orators, hosts of patriotic Democrats
walked quietly to the polls and voted as their
conscience* dictated, in the Interests of the
public welfare rather than of a party.
GOOD MEN IX ALL/ PARTIES.
Eren in so lofty and restricted an arena as
our Senate we have seen the ablest and most
adroit organizer of his. party fall in the most
energetic effort of his life to Induce his party
to reject a great national benefit because it
was offered by Republican hands. Half the
Democratic Senators said this was no question
for pettifogging politics and voted for an
American canal across the isthmus.
Vv'e are not claiming that we monopolize
the virtue or the patriotism of the country-
There are good men In all parties. I know
far better men than I am who are Democrats.
But we are surely allowed. In a love feaet
like this to talk of what has been done In the
family and at least to brag a little of the
Democrats who have helped us. "We get their
votes for one reason only â because we started
right and in the main have kept right. We
Invite accessions from the ranks of cur patri
otic opponents and we shall get them In the
future as we have In the past, whenever wÂ«
deserve them. We ehall get them this year,
because this year we do desrrve them. We
come before the country In a position which
cannot be successfully attacked In front, or
flank, or rear. What we have done, what we
are doing and what we Intend to doâ on all
three we confidently challenge the verdict of
the American people. The record of fifty
year* will show whether as a party we are fit
to govern; the etate of our domestic and for
eign affairs will show whether as a party we
have fallen off; add both together will show
whether we can be trusted for a while longer.
Our plattorm is before the country. Perhaps
it is lacking in novelty. There is certainly
nothing sensational about It. It is substan
tially the platform on which we won two great
victories in the name of McKlnley, and it la
etlll found and serviceable. Its principles
have been tested by eight years of splendid
succeFs and have received the approval of the
country- It i> in line with all our platforms
of the past, except where prophecy and promise
in those days have become history in these.
We ptar.d by the ancient ways which hava
proved cood. .
ILLOGICAL ADVERSARIES.
It would take a wizard to guess what a
dainty dish our adversaries will set before the
sovereign people to-morrow. Their State conven
tions ba\> given them a rich variety to choose
from. As to money, they range all the way
from Bedlam to Belmont; aÂ» to tariff, the one
wing in Maryland is almost cane, the other
wants raving free trade and dynamite for
the custom-houses. When they discuss our
island ooesessions, some want to scuttle away
and abandon them out of hand; other agree
with that sensible Southerner who said:
"What's the use of talking about expansion T
Great Scott', we've done expanded:" One thing
Is reasonably sure: They will get as near to
our platform as they possibly can, and they
will by Implication approve everything Mo-
Klnley and Roosevelt have done In the last
four years. They will favor sound finance and
a tariff which will not disturb business; rigid
honesty In administration and prompt punish
ment of the dishonest; the Monroe doctrine
and an Isthmian canal. To be logical they
ought to go on and nominate the Republican
candidates, who are pledged to all these laud
able policies.
But they will not be logical. They do not
care to oppose our policy; they merely deny
our sincerity In avowing It. They cannot
deny the soundness of our principles; they
pretend themselves to hold them. But the
function of an opposition Is to oppose, and
as they are otherwise destitute of wi lesue they
seek to make a few by attributing to us princi
ples we hava never dreamed of holding and
policies which are abhorrent to us. And dis
trusting the effect of these maneuvers In ad
vance, they announce their plan of campaign
to be not pro-anythlng, but anti-Roosevelt.
This is- a mere counsel of desperation, and
the Republicans will gladly accept the Issue.
Even on this "narrow Issue they will dodge
most of the details. Ask them. Has the Pres
ident beÂ«n a good citizen, a good soldier, a
I good man In all personal relations? Is he a
' man of intelligence, of education? Does he
know his country weil? Does he know the
world outside? Has be studied law, history
and politics? Has he had great chances
to learn and has he improved them? Is he
sound and strong In mind, body and soul? Is
he accessible and friendly to all sorts and
conditions of men? Has he the courage and the
candor and the God-given ability to speak to
the people and tell them what he thinks? To
all these questions they will answer, Tes.
Then what is your objection to him? They
will either stand speechless or they will answer
with the parrot cry which he have heard so
often: He Is unsafe!
THOSE WHO FEAR ROOSEVELT.
In a certain sense we shall have to admit
this to be true. To every grade of lawbreaker,
high or low; to a man who would rob a till
or a ballot box; to the sneak or the bully; to
the hypocrite and the humbug, Theodore Roose
velt is more than unsafe; he is positively dan
gerous.
But let us be serious with these good people.
What are the coefficients of safety In a chief
of state? He should have courage; the wisest
coward that ever lived Is not fit to rule. And
Intelligence; we want no blunder-headed hero
In the White House. And honesty: a clever
thief would do infinite mischief. These three
are the Indispensable*. With them a man is
all the more Â«afe If he has a sense of pro
portion, a sense of humor, a wide knowledge
of men and affairs; If he seeks good counsel;
and. finally. If he Is a patriot, If he loves
his country, believes In It. and seeks In all
things Its Interest and Its glory. Any man
may make mistakes; but such a man aa this
will mak* f e w. and no grave ohm. j

Craft -Which Will Represent America
in English Waters Set on Fire
by Explosion.
NE\v* YORK, July 6.â Presence of
mind and quick action to-day saved the
auto-boat Challenger, one of the two
which are to represent the Automobile
Club of America in the race for the
Harmsworth Cup in England on the
SOth inst.
She was set ablaze by a small explo
sion and subsequent ignition of gasoline
after a successful qualifying run in
Bowery Bay. C. R. Mabley, one of her
owners, and Clinton H. Crane, her de
signer and machinist, sprang overboard
and endeavored to upset the craft.
The ferry-boat Bronx, which had been
swung from her course, came up at full
speed and her crew extinguished the
fire,' which did only about $75 damage.
The Challenger had Just gone over
her course, but how fast she had done
this is kept a secret.

IN DANGER OF DESTRUCTION
As Justice of the Peace Van Xos
trand was going to his courtroom yes
terday he was witness to an alterca
tion between two Italians in the City
Hall corridors, and his prompt action
probably averted bloodshed. One of
the men punched the other in the
face and the* latter put his hand to
his hip pocket and was drawing a
weapon therefrom to use on his an
tagonist, when Van Nostrand cama
upon the scene.
He grabbed the arm of the man who
meant to do violence and sternly in
formed the two belligerents that he
would arrest them if they did not be
have themselves. The man who got
the first blow in said the other had
called him a vile name.
Van Nostrand ordered them to
move on. which they did, going in dif
ferent directions. The rumor soon
spread that a murderous assault had
been committed on Van Nostrand by
three men, and the Judge was kept
busy modestly explaining to inquiring
and anxious friends that he had mere

CY YOUXG IS EFFECTIVE
WITH MEX ON BASES
Will Clark and other heavy specu
lators unloaded on El Piloto at 6 to 5 to
beat FairLady Anna at seven-furlongs
some days since. O'Neil rode the latter
mare and in a driving finish she beat
El Piloto, Tullett. up, a long neck.
The green trotter Will Clark, a son of
Strathway, purchased In California at
a fancy figure by the young Montanan,
was a sick horse after reaching this
city. He had shown a trial in 2:14%
and will not be started until late in
the season, states Driver Ted Hayes.
From here the Clark stable will be
shipped to Moborly, Mo. '
Old MorVen, now thirteen years old,
is still racing, . and only last: week
earned brackets. In the days of the
Bay District,' Morven was famed as &.*
runaway, but a few trips over the
sticks settled him down.
Thompson's Fairy, a daughter of
Scarborough and Bessie Shannon,' has
left the maiden two-year-old class. ' She
is owned by J. M. Capps and was pilot
ed by Joe Kelly, the Piedmont stable
protege.
Slssenvine, ; once the property of
"White : Hat'* McCarty, appears Â» to do
Â¦ well in this climate; for the^ geld
ing galloped a mile in 1:42% the other
day.: It must be remembered the track
Jim Davis paid Denver a visit and it
was claimed for a time had an interest
in a book at Overland Park. When the
management served notice on the book
to cease laying prices, Jim announced
his intention of departing for St. Louis.
It was a spirited betting affair, each
bringing $100 in the auction pooling
done. The Admiral, driven by Ed Laf
ferty, took the first heati the filly being
unsteady. Sally settled down to busi
ness in the two heats following, and
possessing more sped than the colt dis
posed of him cleverly and set a new
Colorado race record for two-year-olds.
Stoney Clark of the old-time firm of
White and Clark, owners of Jim Mur
phy and other noted performers, is
booking for a local firm at Overland.
For a number of years Stoney has been
a resident of Montana and but recently
arrived here after a visit to Chicago.
Donald Mitchell, "the Klondiker,"
one of the players in the famous "stud"
game on Post street three years ago, is
also quartered in these diggings.
Mitchell booked one season at Oakland
and lost a good, fat bank roll. Consid
ered an excellent hand at a quiet game
of draw, he is doing well.
About the best piece of horseflesh
racing at the track is Welch Girl, a full
sister to the outlaw McNamara. The
mare is owned by Jim Hand, but races
in the colors of Fred Kraft. Possart
has been played to beat her on two oc
casions, but she downed the black
horse like breaking sticks.
O'Neil. a youngster in the employ of
George Burger, is one of the cleverest
pilots here. The Oakland officials re
fused to let him ride Cousin Carrie one
day last winter- because of supposed in
experience.
BOOKMAKER DAVIS IX- DEXVER.
RECORD FOR SALLIE LUNX.
J. de la Montanya is here from San
Francisco representing the harness
brigade. Unfortunately his crack mare
Tuna, winner of the Stanford and Oc
cident stakes at Sacramento last year,
is not entered in any of the events here.
In his string besides is Brilliant Girl,
said to be a top notch filly. Both are
in charge of Joe Cuicello.
One of the heaviest operators at the
track is the young Montana millionaire,
Will Clark. Some days since his Wig
gins filly, Sally Lunn, purchased in
New York last fall, met the California
bred colt Admiral Toga, a son of Iran
Alto entered in the name of Joe Cui
cello.
Toledo, which the Denver turfman Ed
Gaylord purchased from Burns & Water
house, was recently started in a five
furlong scramble against an ordinary
bunch of sprinters. It was the colt's
first appearance, as his knees had been
fired before he v.as shipped here fron:
California. Two or three of the books
chalked up 2 to 5,. but a bit of early
action being discernible, this price waB
quickly rubbed to 1 to 3 and 1 to 4.
Bob Austin, one of the partners of
Owner Gaylord, invested to the extent
of S.SOO, but in disgust the latter bet
nothing. The last part of the race To
ledo was cleverly outfooted and beaten
by Billy Mason, the Cheyenne cyclone,
an S to 1 shot. Then, of course, the
bookies wept. They overlooked a chance
to have swept up.
The crocodiles at the City Park are
shedding tears for them. Little can
be said in favor of the California ag
gregation, for they are as impecunious
as the Middle Western and "bush"
brigade. If a horse happens to be 1
to 2 in the betting it is almost impos
sible to bet a box of lozenges on him.
A first-class bookmaker, one who would
take the coin, would now be a bigger
winner than the whole bunch put to
gether.
-^.TOLEDO'S CIN'CII PRICE.
If the strangle hold had not been
barred by the management and a
"skindicate" allowed to operate, all
would no doubt be big winners to date.
As it is, two-thirds of the unhappy
pencilers are complaining of being los
ers, with no chance to get out.
DENVER. July 6.â If there are any
disengaged Chinese laundrymen in San
Francisco" send them over to Denver C.
O. D. to make book. Only remember they
must be non-union hands, for union
help is tabooed in this section of the
country for the time being.
There are. nine so-called layers of
odds doing business at Overland Park,
but the major oortion of them have
n,i5 # sed their vocation. They should in
corporate and purchase the peanut
privilege out at the' Chutes. True, most
of them are booking at a disadvantage,
for it is an open ring.

four dog stake this year. The list in
cludes Pocatelli. Palo Alto, Full Moon.
Hudson, nichard Anton. McVey,' Rec
tor, Tom King, Tralee Lass and other
stars.
Jockey John Bullman, the famous
rider, who was reported en route to
Europe some days since, dropped qui
etly into town yesterday and went
about among his friends. He looked in
the best possible health and indignant
ly denied the story which was circulat
ed in the East to the effect that he had
been drinking. His smart appearance
bore out his assertion.' He came West
with Hiram Pierce, the trainer.
"My domestic relations were not of
the happiest," said Bullman last night,
"and I determined to leave New York.
I gave the impression that I was going
to Europe and then started "West to
visit my mother in Alameda, It was
reported that I wanted to ride in Chi
cago and could not secure, a mount.
This is not true, as I was there only
long enough to have luncheon, and did
not meet any horsemen.
"I went to St. Louis, where I saw Co
lonial Girl win the World's Fair handi
cap. I was offered some mounts, but
refused them. I will start East by way
of Seattle on Saturday and may accept
some mounts in the Northwest while I
am there.
"I broke no contract when I came
West, as I was riding as a free lance.
I had a contract for several years with
August Belmdnt, but as he had only
a small stable this year I did not bind
myself to him. Instead I gave him
first call on my services.
"The yearling sales this season have
been failures, owing partly to the death
last year of William C. Whitney. The
latter was a liberal purchaser and kept
prices up to a high standard. One
could buy an entire carload of the first
consignment of yearlings that reached
the market this season for $100. They
were not fashionably bred, however.
Newton Bennington can get all the
horses he wants to run on shares this
year where in former years he had to
purchase anything he particularly
fancied, as the demand was great.
Other trainers are in the same posi
tion."
SEATTLE. July 6. â Seattle won from
Oakland this afternoon. It was an
expensive contest for' the visitors.
Pitcher Shields strained his arm in the
eighth inning, and retired in favor of
Jay Hughes. Ganley then drove a liner
at Hughes, who tried to avoid it, but
threw up his hands and the ball stuck.
The man was out. but Hughes' little
rlneror of liis rijiht hand was badly
smashed. He was able to linish the
game.
Umpire O'Connell decided it was
time lo stop the kicking which has
< haracterized the Seattle-Oakland se
ries. He served notice on both teams
i hat the next sound meant an out of
the frame. Lehman forgot all about the
order ar.d objected to a decision on a
ball. He was ordered out. Back talk
followed and Cooper cut in. The up
fchot of the matter was that both Loh
inan and Cooper had to leave the
grounds.
O'Connell informed the spectators
that both teams were taking advantage
Â«if the fact that they had no extra in
lielders. and thought they could talk
as much as they pleased.
Buchanan would have won his grame
if he had received good support. The
ecore dees not show the errors of judg
ment that favored Seattle. The score:

BRIGHTON BEACH 1 , July ' 6. â Fif
teen thousand race goers saw E. R.
Thomas' Suburban winner, Hermis,
carrying 133 pounds, defeat the no
less famous th. - 2e-year-old filly Bel
dame, 116 pounds, by a length to-day
in the Test handicap at a mile in 1:38,
which equaled the track record made
by James R. Keene's Voter, with 122
pounds up, on July 17, 1900. W. B^
Jennings' four-year-old mare Dainty.
103 pounds, was third, after at one
time in the "last furlong seeming like-
Jy to, be second.
Hermis, the pacemaker from the
first jump to the last, was fortunate
in getting clear of the other four
starters without losing any grpund,
while Beldame, his most daring com
petitor, did not have clear going. It
appeared that Dick Bernard, which
was second around the turn and for
nearly a half mile, had something to
do with keeping Beldame in a pocket.
The general opinion was that Bel
dame's performance was the grandest
shown by a filly In many years and
there was a general demand from all
classes that there should be a two
horse race between Hermis and Bel
dame before the question of suprem
acy of either could be settled.
According to the scale of weights,
Hermis was conceding only one pound
to the great daughter of Octagon.

consisted of $400 in $10 gold pieces and

Suters continued his chase. Out of
an alley, with Jenkins In the lead, he
ran and at the top of his voice shouted
to pedestrians to head oft the thief.
By the time California and Hyde streets
were reached quite a crowd, which in
cluded Policemen Behan and Merchant,
were\particlpatlng In the, run and Jen
kins was quickly handcuffed and asked
for an explanation. At the City Prison
Jenkins was charged with attempt to
commit grand larceny and Suters will
have to' stand trial on a charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon.
The struggle wagred fiercely until
Suters finally broke loose from the grip
of the would-be thief and looked about
for a weapon with which to protect
himself. A baseball bat stood In one
corner of the room and with this he
started an assault. Jenkins saw trouble
ahead and beat a retreat. The en
raged Suters gave chase, at the same
time drawing a clasp knife, and with
these two implements of war overtook
his man just as he was leaping through
a window in the rear of the premises?.
Jenkins took sash and everything with
him and as he was disappearing over
the sill Suters stuck the knife into his
back, inflicting a slight wound.
James Suters, a freight-handler,
played good Samaritan to Fred T. Jen
kins, who also handles trucks and mer
chandise, and came to grief last night.
He offered Jenkins the hospitality of
his home when the latter needed sleep
to counteract the effect of Intoxicating
liquors, and was rewarded for his open
heartedness by finding that an attempt
was being made to rob him. The melee
that followed savors of melodrama. A
baseball bat and knife were used, the
participants jumped through windows,
one in pursuit of the other, and tho
police ended a chase that stretched
over several blocks.
Suters and Jenkins spent the day In
each other's company and by nightfall
had Imbibed much liquor. Neither
was In a condition to attend a thea
ter, so Suters suggested that Jenkins
accompany him to his home and sleep
off the "jag." The pair boarded a
car and were soon at 1429 Clay street,
where Suters lives. Little time was
lost In preparing for the rest and after
removing hats, coats and shoes, both
men were soon stretched out on the
bed, side by side, and deep in slumber.
Later something awakened Suters.
He was conscious of the presence of
a hand in his trousers pocket. In which
$65 that had survived the spree had
been placed. As he started up to a
sitting position Jenkins seized him by
the throat and attempted to strangle
him.

Now, here's where the storm began
to lower. Mrs. E. M. North, a vigor
cjs writer and founder of the old club,
denounced the star chamber sessions
that eliminated the women mentioned
T.iihout trial, and then the fun was
en. Others followed Mrs. North â
v. ho is an,ardent lover of justice and
fair playâ and "the Writers' Club of
California" sprang from the parent
etodc Now, this news, while good
news, must not lend a false hope to
the husbands of the members of the
P. C. W. P. A., against whom 6uit for
$100,000 damages is pending. The in
stitution of the new club, with the
ir.Jured litterateurs as head and front
T.-iIl not Seal the wounds heretofore
inflicted, and the suit goes merrily
on â not only against the women, but
against their unoffending and wholly
Innocent husbands. Now, that's dis
tinctly a case of Ill-luck, but there are
those that say that a man must take
chances when he marries a writer.
But while it's true that women writers
ere not usually star performers as
cooks and laundresses, the men who
married them never expected to be
called upon to face a 5100,000 damage
suit as co-defendants in a lawsuit.
But with all great blessings there must
come some pain!
Behold the new club of women
writers'. The Pacific Coast "Women's
Press Association no longer holds a
monopoly of the inspired femininity of
the Western world, for lo! on the
Jiorlzon has a rival appeared, tiny as
a white sail far away in the offing;
but, gallantly steered by its captain.

credited by the older craft, the P. C.

ioubt clear to the luminous lights who
u!de the destinies of that cultured
raft â but not quite so clear to the

affairs In that State. Young Monteith
took up newspaper work in St. Louis
and afterward was admitted to the
bar there. In 1885 he came to Riverside,
Cal., where he filled the office of City
Attorney and Assistant District Attor
ney. Here he became an active legal
opponent of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and was noted in after years
as an anti-corporation lawyer. His po
litical course was always consistent
and even his opponents who thought
him to be In the wrong were forced to
respect him for his undoubted sincer
ity.
Monteith was a member of the Order
of Red Men, and the funeral will be
held under their management.
Death came yesterday to Geore^ "W.
Monteith at St. Joseph's Home and
Hospital from the shock of an opera
tion for appendicitis performed a week
ago. He was a well-known lawyer and
was prominently Idetlfled with the la
bor cause. He was 42 years old and
left a wife and two children.

IT'S FUNNY how so many men act.
They toil and labor and struggle.
AND NEVER for a moment think of
rest, or recreation, or pleasure.
AND HOW FOOLISH for those re-
siding in this vicinity, when right
at their door lies the playground,
quickly and cheaply reached.
IF YOU WILL NOT occasionally
give up the daily grind,
DO NOT make your wife and chil-
dren continually walk the treadmill.
AT LEAST give them a chance for
a little change of air that will bring
some color to their cheeks.
PERHAPS then you will lind time to
visit them over Sunday.
AND FORGET yourself as your
children poke grass down your
neck, and in your nose and eyes
and ears.
GET OUT once in a while and romp.
BREAK AWAY and give your fam-
ily a chance to get acquainted with
you,

Company of Chicago to manufacture a special lot of these useful household and sporting

Saturday of this week every one bringing a WANT ADVERTISEMENT for insertion in
next Sunday's CALL will receive one of these useful little premiums.
These scales sell regularly at 40c apiece and cannot be purchased for less than that
amount, so our patrons will readily realize that THE CALL is not only issuing the best pre-
miums ever offered by a newspaper, but is giving them a series of useful articles that can-
not be purchased locally for three and often four times the actual cost of thetr little WANT
ADVERTISEMENT. This concession alone should be a big inducement to insert your

He Is no imitator. His wcrk Is upon original
lines: Pure thought, clear vision. He tells
you what you desire to know and works in the
open light.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he is for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading; when
you call on Prof. Livingstone he will give you
a full life reading for $1; a test Is of little
value; when the mind Is troubled you need
more substantial aid and advice; this Is Just
what Prof. Livingstone gives ycu when you call
on him for a flrst-class clairvoyant reading.
- He asks you no questions, but tells you what
you wish to know.
Would It not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters
that are troubling you, and of the schemes of
your enemies, that you may meet with better
â¢uccess?
He does not mention all the Ills and misfor-
tunes you are heir to; you are acquainted with
the facts in your case; let Prof. Livingstone
analyze the matters that are troubling you.
find tha cause of the trouble and suggest the
remedy.
His only reason for giving your name In full

Is that he does this incidentally as a chain to

LONDON, July 6,â Tho Associated
Press learns from a high .British source
that exchanges of views " are j taking
place between America and Great Brit
ain with respect to Tibet. Being a de
pendency of China,* the fate of Tibet
is of considerable importance, espe
cially to America, not that Americans
have Interests in value ' in that coun
try, but because of Its acquisition by
any power -would mean a violation of
the principle of integrity of China,
which is the keynote of Secretary
Hay's Far Eastern policy to which
Great Britain has given adherence.
Mr. Hay therefore has watched with
the closest attention the British treat
ment of the Tibetan question, and, it
is believed, through . Embassador
Choate, has delicately presented the
possible bearing of the British military
procedure on Chinese integrity. It Is
understood that the British Govern
ment/ frankly disavowed any ulterior
purpose regarding Tibetan territory,
reiterating that it has no intention to
permanently occupy Tibet and that
Great Britain's motives are those al
ready proclaimed to the whole world.
In view of this declaration the .British
Government announced that Brigadier
General McDonald's expedition is ex
pected to retire as soon as the purpose
for which it was organized has been
achieved. - *4.;.

TACOMA. Wash., July 6.â A new
dredger of a peculiar style has been
constructed and shipped to Halnes,
Alaska, by the Bachman Dredging
Company of Pasadena. The dredger
Is to be used on Chilkat River, where
the Chilkat Indians have lived and
fished for generations. It is claimed
that it solves the problem of bringing
to the surface every particle of gran
ular material coming within reach of
its suction pipes. All pockets or cavi
ties holding precious metal will be
quickly emptied. Sand and gravel are
removed by buckets without any in-
Jury to the plungers. At any time a
hydraulio giant can be attached to the
discharge pipe for sluicing purposes.
With the power of such a machine
whole mountains can almost be torn
away, besides turning the bottoms of
rivers upside down. The owners of the
dredger are business men. Tests made
on the shore of the Sound were highly
successful. It is intended to duplicate
this dredger for use in California.
By Use of Improved Machinery River
Beds May Be Drained of All
Precious Metals.

VENTURA, July 6.â The steamer
Bonlta arrived here from San Fran
cisco and after discharging the mer
chandise consigned to this city the
captain allowed the crew to take in
the sights. The merry sailors cleared
out and soon were enraptured by
Ventura's alluring charms, natural
and artificial, particularly the am
ber liquid which drowns sorrow.
Affairs shaped a course down Main
street, two Â» points off the Ana
Cava Hotel, making port in one
of the saloons with a slight list to
starboard, where they spliced the main
brace repeatedly and lost their bear
ings.
Two lads started for the steamer
finally and reached the end of the dock.
In attempting to board the Bonlta one
of the party fell off the wharf. Five
tailors Jumped after him and all
braved the surf to save their comrade.
Fortunately several persons were fish
ing on the wharf and a serious calam
ity was averted. The sailors were pulled
out and are now on their "way to San
Francisco stowed in their bunks in the
Bonita's forecastle.
Fortunate Presence of Sober Fisher

An application was made by the
Richmond and East Shore Electric
Railroad, which is the corporate name
of the new system, to the Contra Costa
Board of Supervisors yesterday for two
franchises to the Alameda County line,
one running through Stege and the
other paralleling the line of the Santa
Fe into Oakland. At the Alameda
County line the Richmond system will
connect with the cars of the Oakland
Transit Company and give frequent
and rapid service into Oakland.
There are rumors that this system
will be extended Into other parts of
Contra Costa County.
j POINT RICHMOND. July 6.â Point
; Richmond now has a fully equipped
! electric street railroad service, which
! was put into operation to-day for the
J first time. It also 1 developed yesterday
that the new system will soon connect
I this city with Oakland, and it is pes
Â¦ sible that there will be a line run to
j the interior of this county.
! The first regular cars were run over
the tracks between the Standard Oil
Works and the business center of town
to-day. The cars are comfortable and
the service gives Point Richmond what
it has long needed, rapid and frequent
communication between the various
manufacturing centers In this rapidly
j growing neighborhood. At present the
i cars only run from the oil works to
! the center of* town, owing to a disa
{ greement between the electric company
j and the Santa Fe over the crossing.
I The track Is laid to the Southern Pa
cific station and as soon as the cross
| ing matter is settled cars will be run
I to that point.
Mr. and MrB. Ambrose Aldrlch and
Albert D. Aldrich will leave here for

ter, Mrs. William I^ollihan, and all pro
ceed to Clarksburg to hold their re
union with their mother, who iÂ» 88
years of age.
Their father died seven years ago.
The triplets were the youngest of eight
children, of which four were girls. The
other brother and three of the sisters
are dead. The oldest brother was killed
in the Civil War. Ambrose is a Grand
Army veteran. It has been forty years
since all the living members of the
family were together.
STOCKTON. July 6.â Two of the old
eat triplets In the world are residents
of this county. One is Ambrose T. Al
drlch, the other is Albert D. Aldrlch,

Mass.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
At dusk the battle was over and,
though fitful bursts of musketry were
still to be heard, the British held the
fort, which dominates the town and
the monastery beyond.
The plan of attack Included three
columns, which were to rush the vil
lages fringing the base of the rock. At
midnight last night British troops be
gan to move Into position. The left
and center columns were able to enter
the village by sunrise, but so heavily
was the fire directed on the right col
umn that it was Impossible to make
any headway for several hours. By 7
o'clock, however, the whole fringe of
villages was captured.
Lieutenant Gordon, who was leading
a party of Sikhs, was killed. The
house tops were full of Tibetans, who
pelted the right column with bullets
for hours. The British ten-pounders
m^de a breach In the wall between the
towers on the face of the cliff, the
wall falling down In great masses.
Shortly afterward an explosion oc
curred in the powder magazine of the
Tibetans, by which many must have
been killed. This, however, did not dis
may the Tibetans.^
When the reserve companies of Fusi
liers advanced and delivered their as
sault the Tibetans opened a heavy fire,
but only one man was lilt owing to
the open formation or the British
troops. By dusk the helmets of the
Fusiliers were to be seen on the highest
building of the fort. The men were
cheering.
LONDON. July 6.â The Gyangtse
Jonk, or fort, is built on a rock rising
Bheer 300 feet from the plain. The west
ern face is absolutely Impregnable. On
the southern side, opposite the British
camp, which is some 2400 yards dis
tant, the rock is somewhat broken. On
every level spot stands a ruined build-
Ing. The road to the top runs zigzag
up to the southern face of the fort.
Along the road the Tibetans had erect
ed three series of diagonal walls, five
feet high and loopholed every few feet.
Twenty-seven cannon were mounted
along this face. On the east and north
the rock slopes gradually to a mon
astery on another rock, opposite the
north . face of the fort.
Gyangtse town lies in a hollow under
the eastern face. The rock throughout
was thoroughly fortified and had guns
at every angle.
, At the bottom of the rock two con
siderable villages extend east and west
These villages recently were Veil forti
fied; the walls had been strengthened
anil cannon had been placed thereon.
There are twelve large buildings In the
space between the fort and a hill sur
rounded by a monastery. All these
were also fortified.
Prisoners reported â¢ some- time ago
that 3000 warriors occupied the forts
and" that there were- 2000 warriors in
the monastery.
GTANGTSE, Tibet, July 6.â The
pinnacle fort near here, held by 7000
Tibetans, was captured by a mere
handful of British and Indian soldiers
t'o-day. The excitement of the long
day culminated in the scaling of a
breach in the walla of the fort by
Lieutenant Grant, who was followed
by a mixed company of Gurkhas and
Fusiliers. They climbed the cleft In
the rock in the face of a hail of fire
and fusillade of stones which were
hurled on their heads by the frantio
Tibetans. A stone struck Lieutenant
Grant, sweeping him off his feet, but
he recovered himself and was the first
over the breach. 6

NEW YORK. July 6. â More than twice as
many ehares of stocks were dealt In at the
Stock Exchange to-day than was tbe case
yesterday, and yesterday's total was more than
twice aÂ» large as the already enlivened deal-
Ings of the preceding session on Friday. The
supposition that the general demand for se
curities has experienced a sufficient revival, as
indicated by this rate of growth, awakens
some skepticism over the character of the
movement of the market. There were other
feature* brought out in to-day's market which
strengthened the cplnion that the movement
iÂ« largely a professional one in Its present
stage. But the momentum imparted to the
price movement by yesterday's operations car
ried tbe level of values to a considerably
higher level to-day. Union Pacific retained
a position of Influential leadership In the mar
ket, but was not bo dominant as yesterday,
and was the subject of profit . taking along
with others conspicuous . In yesterday's
movement. The position of conspicuous lead
ership to-day was taken by Pennsylvania and
United States Steel preferred. The large buy-
Ing of these to-day came from the same quar
ters as that of Union Pacific and Hi. Paul
yesterday. The news to account for 'the ad
vance in thesÂ« two stocks was meager, but
the belief that prices of steel products would
be maintained by the pools and that the
preferred dividend on United States Steel would
bÂ« maintained were dwelt upon. The drift of
political discussion In stock exchange circles
made it evident that the belief is general
that the candidates and the issues between
the two great political parties are practically
decided upon and the supposition was not
lacking that the operations In the markets were
baaed en conditions thus Implied. Crop news
would hardly account for the advance In stocks,
as th* staple markets reflected a good deal of
apprehension over the crops and especially the
wheat market. A rlÂ«e of nearly 4 points ic
Northern Securities on the curb was a sym
pathrtic help to the general market-, but was
unexplained. An advance In the price, of cop
*<>r led to thÂ« riÂ»e in Amalgamated Copper.
An argument much heard for the. advance In
the ceneral list wa* the supposed existence
of a very large and long-standing short Inter
est la the market, which must be obliged lo
take etocks to covtx short contract* if the rise
Is extended to sufficient proportions. The mar
k l r /â¢â¢*Â«Â«Â«<J"r carried to the top level of
th* <lsy In the final hour after much realizing
had been disposed of and the dcslng was fair

Bran continues to corns in freely from the
north and the market is easy in consequence.
Receipts of Hay were lighter yesterday, but
there has been too much on the market lately
and the feeling is weak.
The circular of Somers & Co. says:
"Shipments of Hay have been running
fairly heavy during the past week the total
being 3100 tons, practically the same quan
tity received during the week preceding. To
sum up the situation we would report that In
San Francisco the market is weak but in
the country the feeling is rather strong. In
most districts the farmers are holding for high
prices, considerably above the San Francisco
market. The consumers feel indisposed to buy
at their figures and there Is nothing going on
here except a hand-to-mouth business Out
side districts will figure to quite an extent
with us this season, and it looks as though
shipments would run quite heavy from this
time on in spite of the determination on the
part of many farmers to hold their Hay until
they get a certain high figure.
"There has been some little rumor of late
that the Japanese are looking for Hay on the
coast. All reports tend to show that they favor
Timothy Hay. so tf an "order Is placed in this
cour.try In all probability It will go north. We
had hoped that this foreign trade would help
the San Francisco market materially, but at
the present writing the outlook Is rather dis
couraging.

CHICAGO. July 6.â Weather conditions In
j the southwest were the dominant influence in
j wheat to-day. All other factors were of com
j paratively minor consequence. Reports of
j heavy rains In Kansas. Missouri and Iowa
caused bullish sentiment at the start, and lnl
' tlal quotations on September were up %c to
I at 83HOS3V4c. There was an active de
; mand for Sectember from shorts, resulting
i In an advance of about %c during the first
I hour of trading. The July option also was in
I good demand. There was liberal liquidation
of September going on early In the day but
the market nevertheless continued to gain in
Â¦ strength. September sold up to 83V4c Predic
tions of .additional rain in the southwest had
much to do with the improved tone. Toward
noon the market began to feel the effects of
'the early liquidation. ' From S3Vjc September
declined. to 82!4Â§S3c. Trading during the re
j malnder of the day lacked the enthusiasm
manifested earlier in the session and a greater
Â¦ effort waÂ» required to start prices upward
Â¦ aynin. The market closed firm, however with
i September "He higher at R3%c. "\
I In corn the feelinr was strong. September
closed -vfi ] iC higher at 49%c.
' Oats were firm. September closed at 32%Â®
32Â«4c a gain of %SV4c.
Provisions were weak on a lack of support
from packers and on scattered selling by com
mission houses. At the close September pork
was down 22V4c; lard was off 7V4c. and ribs
wtro down 7}Â£c.

The New York circular of Henry Nordllnger
A Co. say*:
. "in cur market report of February I, this
>e*r. *e stated that the IMS-* Rio and San
toe crop would prove to be rather under than
over ttHSMMMO bag*. The official figures of
thÂ«- crop year }utt c!osc-d verify the correctness
of f>ur ralculaticn. ThÂ«r total Brazilian procuc
t;i<n iRios. Santos, Victorias, Bahlas and
Gearas) during the past year amounted to 11,
:: 000 bags, and the consumption in the
Â«cr:<i i,t these kinds was about 11.500,000 bags.
Bbovtag that consumption of Brazils hae gone
ahr-ad of the production for the first time
t:nct l v :1*-l&<.i0. altiioupfc in a comparatively
Fmat! way. On the other hand, the world"!
produ< iN-.n r>i all kinip of coffee during 1903-4
was about ltt.SOO.000 bag? and the world's con
sumption about ltf.WO.Ono bags.
""IVhi!* 1 we experienced a steady annual in
crease in the consumption of Brazils from ISO-)
10 19U&, we find that thÂ»re Â«u a falling off
this jvst cf about 4<AÂ«>'Â») bag* from the high
nitrk reached in 1902-3. This falling off is.
to toznf exTent. due to the larger consumption
of rr.'.'.i coffees, which were obtainable during
a fair ;art of the year at very near the price
of Brazile. but it 1? also due to the fact that
the consumption of Brazils during the last
four month* has brÂ«n less than the normal
consumption for these four months in previous
>>-iÂ»rs. We erpe-ct to seÂ«Â» a heavier consump
tion of Brazil coffee during 1904-5. and estl
r.-Â»*> tame at fully 12.OUO.000 bag?, because
the d-.s'tributlng trade In this country as well
a* in Europe is now bare of stock and Is
bound to come is u 1 larger buyer than
ji*. pig* ore.
"There has be*n quite a large decrease in
the visible supply cf the world during laft
month, and a slight decrease will probably
lake place during this monih. as against an
increaw <n the visible supply of 47U.UO0 bags
during July last year. Tbe visible supply of
the srcxM en August 1 should therefore be
smalVr than it iru on August 1 last year.
and lt.:t will be the beginning of a change
from what Â«rÂ« have experienced since July,
lituO, to the present day. I. e.. instead of hav
l&S each month a larper \-isible supply than
the same date pf year before, it will for the
flrÂ»t time Â»ho* up smaller, and it will con
tinue that way durinir the whole of the crop
year cf lSÂ»O4-5. We ihir.k there will not bt a
single month in which the visible supply Â¦"ill
oot ix? smaller than it *as the same month
a year before, and we expect that this de
.Â«xeasÂ«- will assume such proportions that by
the T.d of the crop year there will be fully
2.300. fÂ» 10 to 3.00f>.l<00 bags less ceff** existing
in xt.f- vnr'.i than there are now. This makes
it dear that the prospective position of coffee
v-arr*.r:s a considerable improvement in values.
Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that
Â¦Â»â¢ are et the very beÂ»rinning of the marketing
of a croj> which, should offer opportunities for
a stfund buying basis.
MILD COFFEES.
â¢Europe and the -United States received
during the crop year Just past about 5.350.0'JQ
I a^j- of rr.ild coffees, which is by far the
larpwt quantity that came Into tight in any
crop year f-ince statistics were kept. This
ooir.pares very unfa\ - crab!y with the receipts
of I:* 1 :-*. v.-h-n they were only 3.050,000 bairs.
"We '--'Â¦* several times referred to the ab
normally Urge receipt* cf mild coffees, and
have exr'-ained that they were not the product
of one year, but that the largest part of this
excess consisted of three to four years' accu
mulations en plantations, which could not be
forwarded c n account of revolutions raging
<5urirx that time in several Central and South
American countries. We have th*se extra
ordinarily large receipts now behrad us. The
receipts riurir^r the last month ehow a consld
Â»rjW(- ftniryr off and were smaller than for the
same mcr.th last year. We have to deal from
now en cr.ly with the extent cf the actual
er.r.ual crc;i, which it is reported will be
nr.a!kr in the aggregate than they were dur
ir.sr recent years. For this reason we calcu
late on a falling off in the receipts of mild
rr frees of 1 .""OX*** to 1.500. 000 bag's during
1!*>4-S as ronipai^. with 1HO3-4. It Is to be
remarked upon that the consumption of mild
. sfcout MO.fino bajr*. and th*> net result of the
receipts an-i deliveries durin* the past year
\r that ihere are now about 75O,CÂ«XÂ» bags more
mild coffee in ccnFumlr.g markets than a year
ago. This additional quantity, however, does
Dot ar-pear to bear heavily en the market.
"Receipts from now on until December-
January will be very small, arsd in the mean
time consumption Is going on the same as
ever, so that we will most likely see the sur
p!u* stock* Cisapr>ear before fresh supplies
of any txtent can come forward.
"Bogota* have found new channels cf con
â¢UJr.rUfm on account cf their cheapness and
tfceir merits. Demand for these continues to
be brisk. This '.Â« reflected in the price, which
has advanced during the last month about * 4 c |
a pound. Even at that advance they are to
dav the ch'epest mashed coffees Intrinsically
as well as in comparison with the prices ruling
lor the products of other countries."

Shipping Intelligence.
TO SAIL,
T. Crowley, the boatman at Vallejo
ctreet wharf, has at Antioch the speedy
gasoline launch which won the re
gatta there on the Fourth. It was,
however, under peculiar circumstances.
On the evening of the 3d it was dis
covered that the sparking rod of the
launch's engine had been stolen from
the machinery- The captain of the
boat notified Mr. Crowley in this
city of the theft and a new rod
was sent to Antioch on the morning of
the Fourth. It was fitted in place just
as the competing launches were tak
ing position on the starting line. The
launch, called the Guard, started last
in the race, but drew steadily ahead
and finished first in a four-mile dash.
A Trick That Failed.
The ship Mary L. Cushlng (on Puget Sound)
is chartered for lumber thence to Sydney at 33s
9d, with option of Melbourne or Adelaide at

STEAMER STANLEY DOLLAR.
WHICH ARRIVED AFTER DAN
GEROUS VOYAGE FROM CHINA.
Carefully picking her way through
the mine-fields sown by the Russians
in the straits of Korea, the Stanley
Dollar, which arrived yesterday from
Hakodate, steamed through the outer
circles of the storm that is now whirl
ing over the Orient. It was on her
passage from Weihaiwei, China, across
the body of water that washes Eastern
Japan that she took to slipping along
under s!ow-bell. â¢ There is no speeding
of a steamer now in the waters of war-
Ftriekc-n Korea, When the pilot sees
certain dark red, buoy-like objects
coated with rust and seaweed floating
quietly by he knows they are filled
ivith wreck and death. Over goes his
â¢uheel and the ship curves like a start
led thing away from the drifting peril.
The defenders of Port Arthur, in the
hope of catching an occasional Japan
ese, have spread destruction over the
neutral adjacent waters to be hit -or
missed by the peaceful merchant mari
ner as fortune handled his helm.
With the utmost care and with dou
ble lookouts the Stanley Dollfcr steamed
Fafely across the danger zone. Several
times the stray mines were discovered
and avoided in time to escape disas
ter. At the entrance to the harbor of
Hakodate the Japanese have prepared
for the reception of the Vladlvostock
fleet till a gull could hardly drop down
on the water without hitting an ex
plosive. A narrow and crooked chan
nel known only to an official pilot
leads in and not even a sampan dare
venture through alone. A lace-be
decked little captain of the port boarded
the Stanley Dollar and superintended
her passage among the mines. In the
harbor and on shore the restrictions of
the careful Japs became so irksome to
the officers of the steamer that they
remained aboard the vessel to escape
the constant official nuisance.
The sbiD has a cargo of 3000 tons of
rulphur and 170,000 feet of Japanese
oak, a soft wood used in certain art
work. She brought one passenger. J.
C. MaryotC an engineer of the Wei
haiwei Gold Mining Company, on his
Â¦way to bis old home In Nebraska. He
was with the American forces in Ma
nila and also in the dash to Peking dur
ing the Boxer war. The officers of the
Stanley Dollar are Captain John C.
Brace, First Officer H. J. Wright and
Second Officer H. B. Baker. She docked

Collins also got Judge Cook to prom
ise to hear his new accusation against
Hutton, which will be filed before the
Judge's return from his vacation. It
accuses Hutton of perverting and abus
ing the duties of his office in connec
tion with the Duren woman's arrest
and asks for his removal from office.
The original accusation was assigned by
Presiding Judge Graham . to Judge
Troutt's court at Hutton's request and
Collins withdrew it without prejudice.
Collins says he has evidence of the
fact that Hutton issued a written or
der to the police officers to arrest wom
en having their quarters at 1129 Du
pont street and instructing them to
write the name of the women so ar
rested on "Jane Doe" warrants to be
sworn to by a machinist named Gum
mow employed by Hutton as a special
defective. Collins claims that this is a
direct violation of the injunction. There
is another citation for contempt against
Hutton pending before Judge Cook,
which will also be heard on August S.
It is in connection with a raid made
by eight officers on the inmates at
1129 Dupont street a few days before
the Duren woman was arrested.
Judge Cook came from his ranch in
Sonoma County yesterday to hold court
for the purpose of disposing of some
pressing cases and Attorney George
D. Collins availed himself of the op
portunity to obtain an order citing Po
lice Commissioner H. W. Hutton, "spe
cial Chief of Police for 1129 Dupont
street," to appear before the Judge on
August 8 to show cause why he should
not ; be punished for contempt of court
for violating the injunction restrain
ing the police from interfering with
the business of Jean Pon, proprietor of
a restaurant at 1129 Dupont street.
The alleged violation was caused by
the arrest on June 7 of Mary Duren,
one of the inmates of the houses in the
rear of 1129 DuDont street, by Police
men Barry and Fennell on a charge of
vagrancy. The officers refused next
morning to swear to a complaint
against the woman, and she was dis
charged by Police Judge Cabaniss,
Judge Cook having gone on. his vaca
tion. . Collins tried hard to get Judge
Cabaniss to issue a warrant for Hut
ton's arrest for false imprisonment, but
t the Judge declined. However, he is
'sued warrants for the a.Test of the
two officers and the cases against them
are pending.
Other suits for divorce were filed by
Marion Louise Hart against Walter E.

Maude Shirley Gregg'a allegations of
cruelty against William C. Gregg in
clude the declaration that he beat her
into insensibility and ofttimes threat
ened to kill her. She asks for $60 a
month for the support of herself and
two children.
The injuries which William J. Fair
burn suffered at the hands of his wife
Ethel Dolly are almost as harrowing. If
his complaint can be believed. They
were married, he says, at San Jose In
1901, and for the past three years she
has been cruel to him. He declares
that she struck him on the head with
her fist, giving him a headache, threat
ened to knock his head off, bit him on
the shoulder, hit him on the nose,
drawing blood; chased him around a
hall where they were attending reli
gious services, to his intense mortifica
tion, and spat in his face. He says, too,
that she nags him at night and pre
vents him from sleeping.
John Flynn asks the court to an
nul his marriage with Nellie Flynn.
The ceremony was performed at Pasa
dena November 16, 1903, and they have
not lived together since.
Millie Park's charges against her
husband Thomas Edward, in her suit
for divorce, is that he would remain
away from home evenings to attend
prize fights, "upon which, he spent
much money." She says that while he
was able to support her h'e failed to do
so, and after sending her $5 while she
was visiting friends in the country he
would not answer her letters asking for
more money. Finally, she says, he sold
all of their household effects, including
the contents of her own trunk.
According to the stories told In two
suits for divorce filed yesterday, bellig
erent wives do not fight under the rules
laid down by the lamented Marquis of
Queensberry. Joseph F. Mayder. In al
leging that his wife Elsie was guilty of
extreme cruelty, names the dates upon
which she successively blackened bis
eye, boxed his ears, kicked him, called
him vile names and slammed the door
on his foot. They were married in
July, 1893. and the first act of cruelty
cited was committed upon August 5,
1902.

MANY FAMILY TROUBLES

Mrs. Margaret Galvin, who in the
last year has been arrested about a
score * of times for drunkenness, was
g George Curry, the gripman who shot
and killed his faithless wife in her
room on Turk street last Tuesday and
then surrendered himself to custody,
was arraigned and instructed before
Judge Mogan for murder and the ex
amination set for July 12. Curry ap
peared very dejected and his voice was
scarcely audible as he answered the
clerk's questions. He gave his age as
23 years.
Mrs. Maggie Kelly and Mrs. Mary
McGowan were the stellar performers
in Judge Fritz's court. They live next
door to each other on the first block
of Clara street and opposite to the
domiciles is a police station. But the
latter fact, according to Mrs. Kelly's
complaint, did not restrain Mrs. Mc-
Gowan from disturbing the peace. The
specific charge was that Mrs. McGfow
an . hurled . uncomplimentary allusions
and made threatening demonstrations
at Mrs. Kelly.
"I'll show you how it was, Judge,"
shouted Mrs. McGowan, leaping from
the prisoners' bench and swinging
bailiffs and other court attaches aside
until she had cleared a space sufficient
to give her ample room to illustrate
her plea. "I was attending to my own
business when this woman says, says
she, 'Bring out your bare-legged
Scotchman of a husband and I'll spoil
his face for him.' I says, says I, 'You
know he ain't at home or you'd never
say that.' She says, says she, 'Wouldn't
I? Well, you're at home and I'll spoil
your mug for you.' Then we both
went at it."
During the defendant's recital the
complainant sat as if transfixed with
horror at its inveracity and then she
took the floor and graphically describ
ed how she was doing or saying noth
ing at all when she was suddenly as
sailed, by Mrs. McGowan. â¢ To which
Mrs. McGowan kept up a steady
"Tschuck, tschuck, tschuck," with her
tongue, thereby expressing both in
credulity and derision.
Twice did the Judge break into the
proceedings and order a brief continu
ance to give the ladies opportunity to
kiss and make up, but each effort re
sulted in failure. They returned to the
charge more acrimonious than before
and finally they were ordered to go
home and return to-day.
"And if you do not arrive at some
sort of peace footing in the mean
time," quoth his -Honor, "I'll sentence
each of you to a month's compulsory
silence."
Special counsel was engaged and
the proverbial "cloud of witnesses"
summoned yesterday to support each
side of the case of Mrs. Julia Girod of
430 Eleventh avenue against Mrs.
Teresa Perrin, her next door neigh
bor. . The charge was battery and to
Police Judge Mogan was assigned the
delicate task of getting at the facts
and deciding in accordance with them.
Mrs. Girod testified that until last
January she and Mrs. Perrin had
nothing but kind words for each other
and the severance of their friendship
was entirely Mrs. Perin's fault. She
(the witness) was absolutely at' a loss
to account for the coldness with which
Mrs. Perrin repeatedly repulsed her
cordial advances, and finally she
ceased trying to renew the'r erstwhile
amicable relationship, pride restrain
ing her from subjecting herself to fur
ther snubs. So for several months
prior to June 24, the date of the al
leged battery, communication between
the Girod and Perrin households was
entirely suspended.
At the time of the assault, Mrs. Gi
rod stated, she was watering plants in
her garden, when", to hv amaze
ment, she saw Mrs. Perrin leap
over the five-foot fence that divided
the two rear yards and advance to
ward her with threatening mien. The
next thing she knew was that Mrs.
Perrin was belaboring her head with
a heavy stick and calling her some un
printable names. After she broke the
stick on Mrs. Girod's cranium, Mrs.
Perrin picked up' an ax and was about
to utilize it as a weapon when a young
child of Mrs. Girod wrested it from
her. Thus disarmed Mrs. Perrin com
pleted the battery with her fists,
swinging several hard right jolts into
Mrs. Girod's ribs.
Mrs. Perrin's version of the affair
was somewhat different fr.om that of
her accuser. The entente cordiale
was first broken, Mrs. Perrin stated,
by Mrs. Girod borrowing from her a
certain domestic utensil and then
slamming the door in her face when
she went to ask that it be returned.
After that she was told by several
persons of unblemished reputation for
truth and veracity that her character
had been covertly asailed by Mrs. Gi
rod, and when that lady was taxed
with it she fairly deluged Mrs. Per
rin with unladylike language.
It was true that Mrs. Perrin had
beaten Mrs. Girod with a stick until
it broke, but the weight and thickness
of the weapon was exaggerated by the
prosecution, as the Judge could see
for himself. (Shattered stisk pro
duced in evidence by prosecution.)
An attempt to renew the attack with
an ax was stoutly denied, as was the
administration of body blows with
fists. No, the children had nothing
to do with inspiring the assault. The
three little Perrins and the four juve
nile Girods always got along togeth
er as agreeably as "kids" could get
along with each other. The primal
cause of the trouble was the slamming
of the Girod door in the face of Mrs.
Perrin when she went to ask that the
property borrowed from her be sent
back.
Then came the witnesses. Robert
Grant, carpenter, saw Mrs. Perrin use
her fists, but not a stick, on Mrs. Gi
rod. Joseph T. Terry knew the par
ties, but did not see the assault and
Â¦would like to know what he had been
, subpenaed for, anyway. John Perry,
whiskered a la Svengali, saw Mrs. Gi
rod struck with the stick by Mrs. Per
rin. Harry Perrin, bricklayer, hus
band of defendant, was sure his wife
did no more, maybe not as much, as
any lady would have done under sim
ilar provocation and circumstances.
The case was continued till to-day.
"Dr." Samuel Waits, the colored all
round scientist and mystic, was given
sixty days' imprisonment by Judge
Mogan for obtaining money by false
pretenses from various feminine be
lievers in his professions of omni
science. It was the fifth time he had
been called up for sentence and on
four of the occasions he obtained a
postponement by means of some spe
cious plea. The longer he deferred
the inevitable the more serious did his
situation become, as new victims of
his chicanery were materializing every
day. His specialty was to inform the
credulous fair ones that by dreaming
he could foretell the winners of horse
races and thus induce them to intrust
him with small sums for investment
with* the bookmakers.
"For the land's sake, why can't you
go ahead and let â¢ us hear what he's
got to say?" inquired Grace Somerset,
accused of stealing $100 from John
Pero of 530 Third street, when Judge
Conlan continued the case till Satur
day. No explanation was vouchsafed
Mrs. Somerset and her indignation was
at boiling point as she returned to dur
ance. She is the wife of the once
notorious George Somerset, a Dupont
street saloon-keeper.
Robert Clemens was pointing a
pistol at J. H. Warren, armed with a
razor, when a policeman, arrested both
of them at 4 o'clock ' yesterday morn
ing in a saloon at Fifth and Mission
streets. Clemens informed Judge Mo
gan that he was en route from Scot
land Jo Seattle when he was attacked
by Warren, and that he drew the
pistol in self-defense. Sentence to-
Charles A. Lander, a former police
man, demanded a jury trial when he
was arraigned for beating his wife at
their home on Valencia street, and the
jury found him guilty of battery- Then
he was fined $300 by Judge Fritz.
Frank Hoff was the defendant and
J. M. Young the complainant in a bat
tery case before Judge Conlan, but
neither of them looked the part.
Hoff's head was completely swathed in
bandages, while Young was entirely
unscathed. The trouble occurred in a
canning factory at Seventh and Town
send streets, where Young was fore
man and Hoff an ordinary employe.
Hoff angered Young by addressing him
with undue familiarity, cheerfully say
ing, "Good morning, boss," and when
rebuked for his impudence he threw
an empty can at his superior. Hoff'a
bandages told the rest of the tale.
Case continued till to-day.
Xo sooner had Jeff Hamilton of Los
Angeles arrived at the ferry depot
than he began soliciting alms and sev
eral small silver donations had
dropped into his dirty palm when a
policeman nabbed him. Sentence to
day by Judge Mogan.
Frank Albs, a sturdy Teuton, car
ried his Fourth of July celebration
over to the afternoon of the 5th, when
he planted himself in the middle of
a Market-street car track and ignored
the implorations and threats of an
angry gripman until a policeman re
moved him. Judge Fritz fined him $5.
Moore testified that about two
months ago the dog disappeared from
his home and he notified the pound
master to look out for it and also ad
vertised its loss in the daily news
papers. Unlike the historic cat, how
ever, it never came back, and he had
about given it up as kidnaped and con
verted into sausage meat when it was
found in Mrs. Robinson's possession.
He showed tax receipts and identified
the collar worn by the dog as one
he had given to it as a birthday
present. By a strange coincidence he
named the animal "Jack," and the
same appellation was bestowed upon
it by Mrs. Robinson.
"It seems to me," said the court,
"that Mr. Moore owned the dog, and
it also appears to me that the conduct
of the pound officers in selling the dog
to Mrs. Robinson after they had been
told to look out for it by Mr. Moore
demands investigation. I'll continue
the case until next Saturday, when the
poundmaster should be here to offer
some kind of an explanation."
A pugdog is the bone of contention
between Mrs. Edith Robinson of 2 61 4 A
Twenty-fourth street and Harry Moore,
a saloon-keeper at Ellis and Powell
streets. Mrs. Robinson paid $3 for the
animal's release from the pound and
impending execution, and as she was
escorting it past Moore's wet goods
store last Tuesday the bartender,
Johnnie Day, whistled and shouted,
"Come here. Jack," whereupon the
dog ran up to him and waved saluta
tion with its gnarled tail. "Come back
here, Jack," commanded Mrs. Robin
son, but the bartender would not let
Jack obey. That's how the matter got
into Judge Conlan's court.
"William Parker, while under the in
fluence of opium, entered the bathroom
of a Bush-street hotel and was dis
robing himself preparatory to taking
a bath when his arrest occurred. Judge
Mogan gave him three months.
James Dowllng's aunt says he has
been drunk for two years and neglected
his wife, who lives in Chicago, and
Judge Mogan will sentence him to-day
for vagrancy. Despite his long spree
Dowlingr is a fine-looking fellow and
his relatives evidently want to have
him jailed for reformatory purposes
only.
Charles H. Scanlan was given fifty
days for borrowing from a Sausallto
school teacher a watch worth $50 and
pledging it for $20.
Judge Mogan held Robert I* Payn
ter, accused of passing a fictitious
check for $15 on a Pacific street saloon
keeper, to answer in the Supreme Court
with bail fixed at $2000.
sentenced ;to sixty days' Imprisonment
by Judge Fritz. She has a handsome
income from property left her by her
husband, keeps a house and servants
on Eddy street, but is a confirmed in
ebriate. When arrested Tuesday af
ternoon she was under bond on an
appeal from a sixty-day sentence given
her several weeks ago by Judge Fritz.
