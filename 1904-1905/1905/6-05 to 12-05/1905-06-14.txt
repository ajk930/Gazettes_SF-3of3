The Tangier . correspondent â¢ of - the
Times says that the Austrian Govern
ment has accepted the invitation of the
Sultan of Morocco to an international
conference > conditional on a similar ac
ceptance by other powers.
\v^.SHIN*GTON', June 13.â Having no
great interest in Morocco, the State De
partment is rot particularly anxious to
participate in an international conference
for the consideration of the Moroccan
Question. However, should all the pow
ers signatory to the Madrid convention
of ISSO join such a conference and an in
vitation be extended to the United States
to participate in its deliberations, this
Government might accept the invitation.
The position taken here, as stated in
the London dispatch, is* tnat the prefer
ence of the United States is not to take
part unless such action would be satis
factory to France. So far no intimation
that the United States will be asked to
join an international conference has been
received and the only information that
the State Department has on the subject
1b that contained in the newspapers.
This Government has no political and
only slight commercial interests in the
African country. In a measure it recog
nized French influence in Morocco when
it sought that Government's aid more
than a year ago in the rescue of lon Per
dicaris. an American - citizen there who
had been captured by bandits. \
BERLIN, June 13.â The German For
eign Office, taking cognizance of a Lon
don Times dispatch from Washington
eaying that the United States and Great
Britain had declined the Invitation of the
Sultan of Morocco to send delegates to a
conference on the subject of the pro
posed reforms for Morocco, informs the
press that these powers have not de
clined the invitation,, but .have only in
dicated that they would wait and see
what France would do.. Premier Rouvler
still holds the subject under considera
tion and the Foreign Office does not ven
ture to speculate on what France's deci
sion will be.
L/ONDOX, June 13.^<3reat Britain,- as
one of the powers signatory to the Mad
rid convention of ISSO, in answer to trre
request of the Sulton of Morocco to join
an international conference foh the con
ef-aoration of tneMoroccair^OTStion'.~!ias'*
announced that its preference is not to
take any part in the conference unless
s-uch .action would be satisfactory to
France.
The- United States has taken the same
ftand. the two .powers being In accord
with France that such a conference
\u25a0would net be the best avenue of promot
ing argent reforms in Morocco.
In a heated meeting Carlisle, Brackett
and Badger were accused of having ac
cepted salaries and not returned subscrip
tions to stockholders when the amount
subscribed was not sufficient -j begin busi
ness. Dissatisfied stockholders got con
trol of the meeting after a light of near
ly five hours by establishing a precedent
in net recognizing bonus stock proxies.
The Brackett combination threatens to
take the case into court, declaring action
on the. proxies illegal.
The- corporation was incorporated in
Kittery in 1902, with a capital stock of
$6,000,000, nothing paid in, and with the
object of buying up trust companies and
operating branch banks throughout the
country. The prospectus stated that
forty such banks were to be bought in as
many cities and the corporation was to
retain a majority of the stock in each. It
was further set forth tnat the inter
ests of these banks would be well repre
sented by such lawyers as John G. Carl
isle, J. Q. A. Brackett and Walter I.
Badger 'on the board of directors.
'At . the first meeting the entire control
of affairs, including the cash, was turned
over to Fdrmer Senator John M. Thurs
ton, Townsend Percy and J. H. Mooney
on a promise of bringing Western inter
ests into the company.*

NEW YORK, June liâ David J. Brew
er, Associate Justice of the United
States Supreme Court, yesterday aroused
great enthusiasm among- the Vass&r col
lege seniors by an address In which he
referred to woman suffrage and Intimated
that at some future time a woman
might occupy the Presidential chair.
"In this land," said the Justice, "we
have no privileged class that comes to
Its opportunities by inheritance. You
are a privileged class, for you have had
the privilege of a collegiate education.
Do not give yourselves entirely to '\u25a0- the
enjoyment of literature, leaving the re
public to take care of itself. . You owe
to your country the duty of serving- It
with all the advantages of your educa
tion, for who shall say that within the
next decade the suffrage, shall not be ex
tended to women as it has 'already been
in many of the States; who shall say
that before gray hair shall come to your
heads a woman like Queen Victoria shall
not sit In the White House tofglorify
this nation as Victoria glorified . Eng

Congressman Mondell was the last
speaker. He probably paid the most
remarkable compliment to California
that this much lauded State has yet re
ceived by saying that those who were
casting longing looks on California but
who never got here hoped that at least,
when they crossed the divide, they
would reach a hereafter that was as
pleasant in scenery and climate as the
Golden State,
"We desire to have you understand that
the State of California fully appreciates
the gr^at reclamation work that la being
laid out for this State. As members of
the Water and Forest Association, we re
joice that the objects which are near our
hearts have the hearty endorsement of
an awakened public opinion, and the sup
.port of the National Government."
Senator Newlanda of Nevada was called
upon by Judge North. The Senator spoke
of the importance of the visit of the
committee to this coast, where irrigation
promises future empire, and reached the
subject cf water rights, the litigation over
them and the obstruction they sometimes
caused in the matter of general recla
mation. It was only when the supply
was iusuflicient that the question of pri
ority came lip, he said. The sooner the
association settled all such matters so
the Government would rind no obstacles
in its way. the better. The purpose of
the association was not only to protect,
but to conserve the water? and forests.'
No doubt its members would before long
join heartily with President Roosevelt In
his efforts to reform the land laws. The
H.efiker said he believed it was abso
lutely necessary that all land laws In the
statute books that tended to the wasting
ol the public domain should oe revised.
â¢**W are even sacrificing and wasting
what we still have." said the speaker.
"Ther* Is a waste of forests and mines
and other natural wealth that belongs to
the people."
"It is about time." said Senator Ncw
landp, "that we were looking after the
vast natural, wealth that is left to us and
seeing that It Is conserve., and held for
the benefit of ourselves and the genera
tions yet to come."
"You are to view the Sacramento Val
ley, where is one of the greatest oppor
tunities upon this continent for the crc
tion of a great irrigation nyEtem. a sys
tem which we hope to see created by the
National Government, which alone is
to it.
"It is impossible to exaggerate the Im
portance of the policy of reclamation of
crid lands, by the saving and Impound
ing of the storm waters, to which Con
gress has committed Itself. From our
standpoint, your committees are the most
Important committees of Congress and
the matters engaging your attention are
those which promise the greatest benefit
to our people.

This decision was reacned after ex
mining two boys." Jacob Sarowitz, aged
11, and Harry Gordon, aged 10, the ; first
for playing truant, and tne secqnd on
the charge that he stole a gold ring from
his teacher. Miss Anna M. Weiss. Both
pleaded guilty.'
Their parents pleaded hard with the
Judge not to send the boys to an insti
tution. This decided Judge Olmsted-to
act under a new form of commitment, by
which children guilty of small crimes can
be put under the legal guardianship of
their teachers. This means corporal pun
ishment whenever the guardian feels like
wielding the rod or strap, for he has" the
same authority to punish under the law*
as the parents. /"'
This will put all children brought before
the children's court under the teacher's
rod, for Judge Olmsted Intends to' give
whipping a thorough trial under, the law.'
It ie expected that Sarowitz and Gordon,
the- first to come under the new decision,
will be thraehed to-morrow.

DEFE>SE OF WASHINGTON.
FORT HUNT. Va., , June 13.â The. first
gun In the defense of Washington was
fired by one pf the 8-inch batteries at
Fort Hunt at 9:11 o'clock to-night. The
target was one of the units of Admiral
Dlckins' squadron, which appeared to be
of the gunboat type. She had Just round
ed Marshalls Point, about three miles be
low the fort, proceeding slowly up the.
river. ' That she Was- an "enemy" was
indicated by the signal from one of the
sixty-inch searchlights of the fort. After
the initial fire the shooting became gen
: eral. -Not a reply came irom the war
ship, and when the required number of
shots from the fort had.. been ft reel to
constructively put the ship out of:action
the firing ceased. â¢
The. offending -craft passed calmly up

from the forts \u25a0 and - when she . reached

gathered, but not before -the rapid-fire

Breakfast at; the: Portland Hotel'
opened the day's adventures. After this
the members of the party went to the
exposition grounds. They were there
yesterday, ""but the day was fraught
with speeches and formality, that took
the gloss off of genuine pleasure, and:
so It was arranged : that to-day could
be-put in. reviewing the' splendid Call
fornia exhibit and seeing the show from
other points of the compass.
The walnut, elephant.- the prune bear
and other California industrial g conceits
came in for their share of commonwealth
pride, but most of all -v the visitors ad-j
mired the natural beauty of the grounds
and the sublime panorama of scenery,
everywhere in; evidence. \u0084 . \
From 12 1 until -2 > o'clock the j delega
tion enjoyed social? .pleasures: and
luncheon at the American Inn. .This
was all arranged so that the daycould
be devoted to seeing the sights of the
exposition without : losing, time -in go

tain tlie *; inner being; of 1% the visiting
sightseers. .All through the grounds
percolated "the yellow, badge '- of" the
Californian, and the patriotic poppy of

It was a love feast of the first order.
Oregon speakers disclaimed proprietor
ship of the exposition, saying that it
was- a coast and northwest affair; that
this had been demonstrated by the fine
displays sent and the great interest
taken in the affair by all the sister
States, not the least in any degree by
California. The visitors, responded in
like spirit and claimed partnership in
the big show. -\u25a0 .
The California delegation to the
Lewis and Clark Exposition, Portland
and Oregon had a good time to-day.
All restrictions were thrown to the

lONE, June 13.â What appears to be a
brutal murder was reported to-day from
Lancha Plana, ; a short distance from
here. Mrs. George Williams, an elderly
lady, who lived with her grandson, was
found "dead to-day by a small girl who
was hunting for some cows. Upon en
tering the house the girl found the old
lady dead with two or three fierce gashes
across .her throat. Apparently the body
had been lifeless- since Sunday.
The grandson's baseball suit. was found
near the body. He has not been seen for
sevaral days, and no trace has been
found of him. So far as known Mrs.
Williams was. not rich, and no motive is
known for the deed. ;

Oscar, in a long and vigorously worded
letter to the president of the Norwegian

The method used by Driscoll, according
to his own statements, was this: An em
ployer or an organization of employers
affected by a" strike, or likely to be,' would
call and ask him to use bis Influence to
bring about an adjustment of the diffi
culty. The fees, according to Driscoll,
paid the union men ranged from $100 to
thousands of dollars, the aggregate be
ing estimated by him at JSO.OQO. Driscoll
declares that he never received a dollar
df this money for his efforts In averting
trouble, except from the organization of
which 7 he acted as secretary.

Within the next twenty-four hours, it

transactions of labor unions In Chicago
for the past four years will be made pub
lic, and the information will implicate
many labor leaders, who. it is asserted;
have accepted bribes to call off strikes.
The man who is expected to give , this
information is John C. Driscoll. former
secretary of the Coal Owners' Union, who
has been intermediary between the em
ployers and the Teamsters' Union in this
city, for the past four years.
To-morrow morning. Driscoll says, he
will appear before the Grand Jury with
documentary evidence showing that sev
eral labor leaders have been receiving
large sums of money through Driscoll,
which, it is declared by the latter, the
employers were forced to pay to prevent
their employes being called out on strike.
To substantiate his statement. Driscoll
displayed to-night a bank check book, the
stubs on which, he said, corresponded to
the amounts of money paid to these labor
leaders. | This bank book will be offered
in his testimony to-morrow before the

for an opinion on them by noon on

REMOVAL OF COUXCIMIAN' CAVEX.
The removal of Select Councilman
Caven to-day caused a great sensation.
The affidavit charges that Caven, while
a member of Councils, committed "the of
fense of being interested directly and
indirectly in certain contracts for supplies
and material for the use of the city.
Those supplies consisted of sand and
gravel, which were furnished to Daniel
J. McNlchol & Co., contractors, to be used
In the new filtration beds.
The committee-room was crowded.
Select Councilman Thomas J. Ryan, the
only Democratic member of Select
Council, suggested that the bills be
sent to the City Solicitor for his opin
ion as to their legality. His â¢ sugges
tion was received with a storm of
hisses.. This made Ryan very angry
and he spoke bitterly of the (disturbers.
Four members' of the committee who
spoke against the repealers were called
"thieves" and "crooks*''and so disorder
ly did the proceedings become that a
squad of police was hurriedly sum
moned. Thereafter better order was
maintained.
Recently four street car companies,
subsidiary concerns of the" Philadelphia
Rapid Transit Company, which corpo
ration controls practically all the street
car lines in the city, caused** to be
passed by the City Councils ordinances
giving them the right to lay track on
110 miles of streets, 'without the city
receiving anything for the privilege.
Citizens protested against the ordi
nances and Mayor Weaver vetoed them.
On the. same day the gas lease was
passed by councils and the four bills
were passed over the Mayor's veto, but
no further action was taken because
of the gras lease fight. Two weeks lat
er, when councils adopted a resolution
withdrawing the gas lease bill, four
ordinances were introduced repealing
the street railway ordinances and to
day was set for a hearing on the meas
ures. ; js â¢ ' * "\u25a0\u25a0:\u25a0' ' ."
PHILADELPHIA. June 13.â Amid
cries of "Thieves!" and "Crooks!" and
under the protection of a squad of po
lice, the council committee on street
railways referred to the City Solicitor
for his opinion as to their legality
four bills repealing ordinances grant-
Ing: street car companies the right to
use 110 miles of street to lay tracks (
without the requiring of any compen-'
'sation for the franchises. The meet-
Ing 1 was in all respects as sensational
and as stormy as that held by the com
mittee on nnance some weeks ago,
when 'the gas lease was under consid
eration. The "repealers" were Intro
duced at the instance of Mayor Weaver,
and the action of the committee to-day
is the first setback the Mayor has re
ceived since the inauguration of tn'e
reform movement, which was begun
with the fight on the gas lease.
Another sensation in the political
situation to-day was the arrest at the
instance of the Mayor of Frank H.
Caven, Select Councilman from the
Thirty-fourth Ward, on the charge of
having violated his councilmanlc oath
by being Interested In city contracts.
He was held in $10,000 "bail for a further
hearing-. He denies the charge.
The fight over the street car fran
chises promises to be a warm one be
fore It Is finally ended. It is a con
test between the Mayor and . citizens
living: in the territory through which
the proposed new lines are to.be run,
on the one hand, and' the Philadelphia
Rapid Transit Company, backed by the
Republican organization, on the other.

years, signing his own name to Jarvls*
application for it. This he does not deny.
He will only say. generally, that he is
guilty of no crime.

ATHENS. JunÂ« 13.â Theodore Delyan
nls, the popular Premier of Greece, was
stabbed and mortally wounded by a
professional gambler named Gherak
aris at the main entrance of the Cham
ber of Deputies at 5 o'clock this after
noon. The Premier died within three
hours. The assassin, who was immedi
ately arrested, said he committed the
deed in revenge for the stringent meas
ures taken by Premier Delyannis
against the gambling-houses, all of
which were" recently closed.
The Premier arrived at the entrance
of the chamber in a carriage. Gherak
aris approached, saluted the Premier :
and opened tfcfe carriage door. The Pre
mier was in the act of thanking Gher
akaris for his (courtesy, when the gam
bler plunged a long dagger into Del
yannis* abdomen. Inflicting a frighjtful
wound.
The murderer was immediately over
powered by the attendants. Medical
assistance was summoned and the
wounded man was taken to a Red Cross
station, where an operation was per
formed in an effort to stop the inter
nal hemorrhage. This was unsuccess
ful, and Premier Delyannis died at 7:30
o'clock.
The news spread quickly and It
would be impossible to describe the
popular evidences of sorrow or the an
ger of the crowds, which attempted to
lynch the assassin. Lynching was pre
vented by the gendarmes, who rushed
their prisoner from the. building to
prison.
It is estimated that 20.000 persons
witnessed the removal of the body of
the Premier from the Red Cross sta
tion to his late residence. Members of
the Cabinet and of the Chamber of
Deputies were among the crowd, many
of them weeping.
The Cabinet met this evening at the
residence of the President of the cham
ber, and It was decided that ;the Pre
mier's body should lie in state in the
chamber before interment.
King George, who is at Taoi. an
nounced that he would at once return
to Athens.
Investigation by the police shows
that Giierakaris was recently liberated
from prison, having been sentenced to
el?htÂ«Â«n years for the murder of his
wife.
Gounarakis, Minister of Finance, has
b<*n appointed Premier provisionally.
The funeral of Delyannis. which will
be a national one, -will take place next

DR. PIERCES REMEDIES.
No joy or pleasure on this earth quite
equals that which comes into the home
when baby arrives. Who can describe
the happiness of man and woman, joined
in wedlock, as they look upon the fragile,
delicate mite that is blood of their blood
end flesh of their flesh ? And who can
depict the hopelessness and dejection
that hover about the home where the
wife is incapable of becoming a mother?
Barrenness proceeds from some derange-
ment of the distinctly feminine organs.
Many of the common ailments known as
"female troubles" cause it. Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription overcomes barren-
ness by stamping; out diseases of women,
and by healing and curing ulceration. It
tones np the system, stops drains, and
restores strength. During gestation it
modifies morning sickness, gives elastic-
ity to the overstrained parts concerned,
makes the hour of baby's coming short
and almost painirss, ana gives wonderful
recuperative power to the patient.. By
making the mother strong and cheerful,
it makes the little one healthy, vigorous
and good natured. Insist upon the med-
icine dealer giving you Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription when you ask for it.
Substitutes are often dangerous.

BERLIN, June 13.^The .Navy Depart
ment has ordered from the Germania
works six seagoing torpedo boats of a
different type from any previously con
structed or authorized. They are on the
Government .list as "G" 132 to *'G" 137.
The Cologne Gazette says they are to be
of large displacement, and in every way
stronger built and fitted with more nu
merous torpedo tubes than the torpedo
boats previously constructed. The vital
parts of the new boats will be protected
from the tire of the smaller guns of war
ships.
These boats, which are to be completed
inside of a year, are expected ito have a
speed equal to the boats of the present
type, owing to their powerful machinery.
At the same "time they will be strong
.enough to withstand the fire of an enemy's
quick-firing guns while approaching a
warship, and discharging torpedoes. One
of the six boats will be fitted with turbine
engines as an experiment.
Papers supposed to have semi-official
inspiration continue lo speak dubiously
of the results, but it is noticeable that
the cheap and popular papers like the
Cazette plainly advisu the people to rec
oncile themselves to defeat and peace.

the Japanese Government expressed a desire
therefor.
Japan's terms continue to be mauer for

ST. PETERSBURG, June 14.â Instead
of publishing the text of Its official reply
to the message from President Roosevelt
regarding the Initiation of peace nego
tiations with Japan, the Russian Govern
ment decided, with the purpose of taking
the public into Its confidence regarding
the prospects of peace, to issue a state
ment summarizing the status of nego

ot a communication In the Foreign Ofnce
Gazette to-day. This statement, which
pfc-ys i a graceful tribute to President
Roosevelt's action, expresses in a general
way Russia's willingness to negotiate,
without entering into particulars, which
cannot bÂ« considered to be definitely de

under the circumstances, has deemed It
best to leave to the Washington Gov

dicted in these dispatches, the " written
decision of the High Admiralty Court,

of conditional contraband in the case of
cotton and timber.
The decision avoids a direct enuncia
tion of the conditional contraband prin
ciple, but in ' justifying the confiscation
both of cotton and timber in the case of
the British steamship Calchas, it argues
at length that the circumstances created
a fair inference that the former was des
tined, for the use of the arsenal at Kobe"'
in the manufacture of explosives and that
the latter was : intended for "use in Jap

Peace Prospects.
TOKIO, June 14." â The Japanese Gov
ernment still maintains silence regard
ing peace negotiations. It is appar
ently awaiting action in and advices
from Washington and St. Petersburg.
The newspapers and the public continue
a spirited discussion of the situation,
devoting themselves largely to a>prob
able. armistice and the terms of peace.
The newspapers continue to> be
flatly opposed to an early armistice
which would deprive the array: and.
navy of ; the- '* advantages within
their grasp. It is generally believed
that Field Marshal Oyama's plans
are rapidly maturing and that . the
next great drive will sweep General
Linevitch back and carry the ' Japanese
army Into Russian territory. . .
The good faith and ultimate inten- 1
tions of Russia toward peace are openly
and generally questioned.,- The; Japa
nese Government, possibly, is assured
on this score, but its silence leaves the
public doubtful.* The Japanese public
would welcome peace,' but it-demands
terms consistent with victory and as
suring a permanent peace. -.
People Â«t Japan Sot Enthusiastic Over

Satisfaction here prevails at the pro
gress of the peace preliminaries, but
there is pessimism concerning the par
ties agreeing on final terms. Financial
circles are the exception to this feeling.
The Bourse is showing great buoyancy
and there was a general advance In
prices to-day, owing to the prevailing:
belief in the success of the American

a glowing tribute to President .Roosevelt,

Russia regards her consent to appoint
plenipotentiaries to discuss means of end
ir.fi the war as a tentative argument. Al
though iiJÂ«* word plenipotentiaries is 'used
in the Ru^fcian reply, it is understood
that their appointment 'does not commit
Russia to any plt-^ge to end the war.
Russia's object Sn appointing these fully
empowered envoys is to find out whether
Russia can obtain from Japan peace
terms which- It is possible for Emperor
Nicholas to accept. Japan is naturally
cautious, although she, too, has accepted
the President's offer of good will, and
agreed to appoint plenipotentiaries. The
negotiations have progressed far enough
for the belligerents to be discussing,
through the President as the channel of
communication, a suitable place. the
number of negotiators, and, what is more
important than either of these, a common
basis on which the plenipotentiaries may
meet.
A diplomat explained the situation to
night when he said certain optimists had
succeeded In gtttopg ahead of the actual
gisiiis quo of the negotiations.
"These optimists," he added, . "nat
urally become alarmed when they find
that the negotiations are not keeping
pace with their predictions and straight
way th*y announce a bitch in the nego
tiations."
Notwithstanding the lateness of the
hour of Embassador Jusserand's de
parture from the White House, infor
mation concerning his conference with
the President excited lively Interest, es
pecially among members of the diplo
matic corps. In an important quarter the
belief was expressed that no difficulties
bad arisen in the progress of the negotia
tions which would amount to a hitch, or
which could not be smoothed out with
tact and earnest persistence on the part
of the President.
Direct communication between St.
Petersburg and Tokio has not yet been
established. The White House is yet the
medium for all communications between
the two capitals. Important details re
main to be agreed upon before the plen
ipotentiaries of the belligerents can meet
to discuss the means of ending the war.
Progress is being made, but it may . be
several days, or even longer, before all
dei&ils for the meeting can be definitely*
fixed.
Jusserand, after the conference, said it
would be discourteous to the President
for him to discuss for publication the na
ture of the interview. Asked whether a
bitch had occurred in the peace negotia
tions, he replied frankly that he had
beard of none.
WASHINGTON. June IS.â Embassador
Jusserand returned to-night from West
Point, where he went to deliver an ad
dress. At his embassy he found a note
from President Roosevelt, requesting him
to calJ at the Whtte House. He reached
the President's home at 9:15 o'clock and
remained with the President until 11
o'clock.

TO BECOME A BRIDE
LOS \u25a0 ANGELES. June 13.â Two
weeks, ago a dapper youngr' manÂ»styl
ishly dressed- and seemingly \ supplied
with unlimited capital appeared in Los
Angeles.' Whence he came "his "asso
ciates know not. The stranger / gave
the name of Wilson P. Wilson, "car
ried what appeared to be good letters
of introduction, and soon proved ' him
self a -high .roller of greater magni
tude than any who have appeared here
in years. . He soon established a credit
and followed it by, setting a pace
which amazed even confirmed rounders.
He hired automobiles by the day and
took his friends *to roadhouses, where
he ordered the doors closed and the
entire-house turned over to his guests.
He paid the bills,' and-. it" was nothing
uncommon forx an' afternoon's fun. to
cost him several . hundred dollars.
Then his cash ran out, but his supply
of checks was unlimited, and he had
little trouble in cashing all the checks
he cared to write. . Four ..days j have
elapsed since he commenced cashing
checks, and to-day.' it was discovered
that not one of the checks is good.-
To-day a warrant' was Issued charg
ing Wilson with ujttering' bogus checks.
He was arrested at .10 o'clock to-night
at San Pedro on. -board a lumber
schooner which will leave to-morrow
morning 1 .for . Puget Sound. He ac
knowledged his guilt and told. the of

outside sentinel is conceded. Mrs. Emma
Lilley of Ivy Parlor seems the unanimous
choice for grand marshal.
The session this evening was also taken
up with the president's address. It is
eaid that she recommends that the order
take entire control of the Native Daugh
ters* Home at San Francisco. The ab
sorbing topic of the convention Is the
election of officers, which occurs Thurs
day. It is settled that Grand Vice Presi
dent Ariana W*. Stirling will be advanced
to grand president. Eva T. Bussenius ot
Los Angeles probably will defeat Emma
Gruber Foley of San Francisco for vice
president, as the southern delegation is
back of her. Indications point to the re
election of Grand Secretary Laura J.
Frakes. although Elizabeth F." Douglass
cl San Franciscoo is making a good fight
for the place. For grand treasurer Anna
F* Lacey of San Francisco and Miss
Mary A. Dempsey of Minerva Parlor No.
2 are candidates.

Rheumatism
Like Neuralgia, is now known
to be a nervous disease. The
kidneys become weak through
lack of nerve energy, and fail
to filter the uric acid from the
blood; this acid attacks and
burns the nerves and muscles,
and consumes the oil in the
joints, producing inflammation,
fever, swelling â pain. - :
To cure Rheumatism, then,
you must restore the kidney
nerves and muscles, and neu-
tralize the effect of the acid
upon the joints and 7 tissues
with Dr. Miles' Restorative
Nervine, a nerve medicine,
which has made many cures of
this painful disease. Nervine
strengthens the kidney nerves
and increases the circulation,
and relief is assured.
"before I took Dx\ Miles* Nervine,
I had been looking for a cure for
Rheumatism for. 25 years. -. The last
time I -was laid up lor several months,
could not get out of bed or set foot
on the floor. I tried , remedies to rub
In. to drink, doctors' prescriptions,
etc.. but none of them had any effect.
One day 111 1 read about Dr. Miles'
Nervine and got a \u25a0 bottle. After the
first dose I had a good nfffht's rest,
and after taking: half a. bottle : the
pains disappeared, and I went out and
\u25a0walked all around the town. In a week
I â¢ went to work, and was perfectly
cured, but continued to take - the-
medicine for a time, to make sure thai
pains would not come back." v
\u25a0; THOS. LONG.
313 N. Chatham St.. Racine, Wls.
Dr. Miles* -Nervine Is sold by your
druggist, who will guarantee that tho
first bottle will benefit. If it falls, he
will refund your money.

To "Whom It may Concern: After treat-

for the past six years I called on Dr.
\u25a0 Wong Htm. He made a simple examina-
tion by feeling the pulse and explained my
case fully. I asked him if he could cura
'it. Be said yes.' in from six to eight weeks.
which 1 can truthfully say he did. The
nhysiciaca here think him a wonder. Any
one writing me I will be only too glad and
thankful to answer. I can cheerfully , rec-
ommend him In the very worst cases of

So went the testimony to-day. To
pzove that Normand had been in mystic
hands, letters were read to his Honor, the
first of which was from "Candor to
Arya." It recited:
Mrs. Hall and her confrere in occultism
fell out. Normand says he decided to
Quit toying with the spirits. His first
move was to get back his property. Mrs.
Hall, he asserts, did not rely upon spirit
protectors in the contest that followed,
tshe called in strong, husky, material,
Constable Tom Carroll, the champion
hammer-thrower, and he cast Normand
into a cold cell.
Xormand Is a miner from South Africa
who says he met Mrs. Hall at a session
in San Francisco of the Everlasting Sun-
Ebine Club, an organization which, says
the Transvaal immigrant, dallies In the
occult ari_ The acquaintance there formed
Jed Normand to purchase a lot In Allen
dale, back of Oakland, where he settled
down In a tent, after building a house
for Mrs. Hall to receive the beno3ts of
her superior mystic knowledge. But t'-ie
affinities were not attuned properly.
Something went awry with the telepathic
connections. In short. Normand did not
prove to be a receptive subject.

OAKLAND. June .13.â With a baby as
the prize the real mothsr has gone into
a fight to recover her child from its
foster parents, who are loth to give the
little one up, as they have reared it from
a tiny baby until now it is a healthy boy
nearly four years of age.
According to the story told to Judge
Melvin this morning by Marie Nicholson,
she had left her child at a maternity.
Koine in San Francisco, and, unknown to
her. it had been given to R. Carrick and
wife of West Berkeley, and after three
years of search she only recently had
been able to find 1L Now she wants the
child, but the Carricks are not willins to
give it up."
The foster parents say that the baby
was obtained from a foundling home
when but a few weeks old, and that a
short time ago a woman came to their
home and said it was hers. They had
come to iove It as their own, and never,
having taken any legal steps toward its
adoption they last Saturday went through
this formality before Judge W. H. Waste.
Finding herself blocked and the Car
ricks determined to fight for the pos
session of the little one. the mother of
the child to-day had Attorney Jacob S.
Meyer sue out a writ of habeas corpus,
alleging that the Carricks are holding
the child without right, and they have
been ordered to produce it in court
Thursday, when Judge Melvin will en
deavor to decide which of the women
feas the legal right to It.

The entomologists of the university hope
to produce, a; variety that will be immune
from the attacks of the corn worm. They
have procured, a' plat of ground at Mil
pitas, and in this many varieties of corn
have been planted,, all of which will be
allowed^to'grow. to maturity. 'From these
varieties; a suitable corn for packing will
be chosen, one that has been proved to be
strong enough: to resist the pest. , v
It has been found that all the sprays
hitherto used to \u25a0 destroy the corn worm
haye completely ruined trie corn ltseu, so

As soon as the robber departed Mrs.
Hamilton gave way under the strain and
was obliged to .retire. She was in a
state of collapse heightened by her weak
ened condition, the result of recent ill
ness. Her fear of .vengeance .prevented
Mrs. Hamilton notifying , the police
at once. . She waited until her husband,
James Hamilton, arrived and then, told
the story. Hamilton informed the de
tectives.. The last, seen of the robber was
as he walked along Fourth street toward
Clay. Mrs.. Hamilton, described him
as tall, slender, dark, with long black
mustache, an Italian or Frenchman. He
wore a gray suit of clothes and ; a cow
boy hat. . . \u25a0 , , '. \u25a0 " .
John Wilson, a traveling jeweler, was
held up by a masked man late to-night at
Fifth and Madison .streets.' A gun was
placed, against' his head .and the robber
commanded him to .give up his money and
valuables. All, Wilson had in his posses
sion*" was 95 cents, "which he turned over
to the robber." â¢" - : " -v
Mrs. Hamilton was alone in the j house
when she was summoned to the front
door by the sharp ringing of the bell. As
she opened the door, a tall, slim man
asked her whether she had any furnished
rooms to let. Unsuspectingly, Mrs. Ham
ilton invited the caller into the reception
room, Intending to show the. apartments
to the inquirer. Xo sooner had she closetf
the door than the stranger whipped out
a pistol, and pointing it at the startled
woman's head, gruffly commanded: '
"Give me your sack.". .: '/\u25a0'
Mrs. Hamilton protested she had no
money, but the hold-up man persisted.
At the same time he grabbed at her
skirts, and felt the weight of coin that
was in her Docket. With an oath the
robber ripped at the dress and tore out
the pocket, appropriated the money ana
started off. Just as he left the robber
said:
\u25a0 "If you s-ay a word to any one about this
for four days I'll set your house afire."
During the encounter Mrs. Hamilton
tried to call her children, who were In the
rear of the house. But they did not hear
their mother, 'and she was prevented
from making any further outcry by com
mand of her assailant.
OAKLAND. June 13.â 1n the guise of a
lodger, an armed robber entered the St.
Ignace, 514 Fourth street, at 5 o'clock this
afternoon, held up Mrs: Sadie Hamilton,
the landlady, with a revolver and took
125 from her. As the daring thief de
parted he warned the frightened woman'
not to whisper, concerning the crime for
four . days under the penalty of having
her home. burned to the ground. :!\u25a0-\u25a0

"I don't know now; I couldn't find out

McLean Is a Nova Scotian. He is well
known all along the coast. For years it
has been said that' he has earned his
living by smuggling and poaching, but
the Federal authorities were never able
to get the evidence on him.
It is said that he was part owner of
the schooner Glen that left Port Town
send several months ago with - a cargo
of Chinese and .opium. She put in at a
Southern California port sans Chinese
and sans opium. .
De Smidt came here from Tahiti. He
said he was a planter. It was reported
to the Federal Grand Jury that he claim
ed that he had been roped into the deal,
but was going to stay in the game until
he got his money back. He has a wife at
Papeete, and is a man of education and
good addrps, . having been a successful
drummer in this city.. '
McLean and De Smldt were not on the

among shipping men that De Smldt's
chances of ever getting back alive from
the region where there is'"no law of God

NEW YORK, June 13.â Between 186S and
1904 . the annual death rate from heart
disease and Bright's disease In New York
Cky increased from 13.05 to 29.69 per 1000
population. In 1903, with the/ same ratio
to I'JM, there was an increase in~ deaths
from these diseases 0f"2.42in each 10,000.
While this was- considered an alarming
increase in the mortuary records, the
fact that 125 persons died last week from*
organic heart disease/ when the death
rate for the corresponding 'week ; In 1904
was only fifty-six,' has given: rise to the
belief among physicians that "New York
residents are living* too rapid lives. -
The strain of business and cares at
tendant on anxiety to gain wealth is
given as an explanation by physicians of
the conditions that exist. "Physicians
have established'- the .fact 'that 'the -nerve
forces which -'control both the stomach
and the heart are affected ; by '; the' hurry"
of men in the daiLy scramble to bolt their
food in to \ quickly* resume \u25a0- their

The Federal Grand Jury (ndlrted tiro
â¢hipping: afents, a nailniaker, an ad
venturer from Tahiti, and n nea rap
tain yesterday for oonsjjirarj to vio
late (be lavr coverin&r the taking of
\u25a0teals. The men Indicted are Robert J.
Tyson, a shlpplns: ascnt at 16 Califor
nia street; W. J. Woodnlde, skipping;
agent at 18 California streets W. J.
Wood, a sallmaker at 3C Steuurt street,
and S. E. R. de Smldt, who claimed to
be a planter from Tahiti, and Captaiu
Alexander McLean of the schooner Car
nendta, which be ha, used In ililt
Â»<rork at different times under the name
of the Acapulco nnd the Jennie Thebln.
McLean and De Smidt are now on the
Carmencita somewhere in the Bering
Eea. The vessel's register was taken
away last year and she Is now classed
as a pirate. The revenue cutter Bear
left Honolulu yesterday under orders to
captur* the outlaws. Tyson. Wood and
Woodslde were arrested yesterday, but
were afterward released, each furnish
ing bonds for $3000. Wo'odside declares
that he knows nothing about McLean or
the Carmencita. Ty6on admits that he
acted as agent for the schooner's own
ens, but asserts that he did not know for
what purpose she was being used. Wood
could not be found last night.
In the latest operations of McLean of
the Carmencita is a story as strange as
Kipling's "Rhyme of the Three Sealers."
No wonder, for McLean of the Carmen
cita is Rueben Payne in the "Rhyme of
the Three Sealers" incarnated. The Car
mencita was involved In a fight in the
fog as desperate and as bloody as the
<->ne described by Klpiing. The truth in
this case is stranger than fiction.
On May 3. 1904, the little schooner Car
mereita cleared from here under the
Moxican flas. She was bound for Vic
toria on a codfishing expedition, so it was
reported. But whispers got abroad that
ji vessel bound on. a peaceful fishing ex
pedition did not need as complete an
arsenal as the Carmencita carried. Be
sides, Captain McLean had not the most
eavory reputation in ports from here to
the zone of the Northern Lights. De
Smidt went along as ship's doctor,
though he knows nothing of medicine.
Due north the Carmencita headed and
she did not drop anchor at Victoria. Up
through the Bering Straits she railed to
the peal rookeries at Copper Island, Rus
sian territory.
A landing was made in a dense fog one
liiorning. McLean and his hunters were
liiisy knocking seals on the head when
ihe alarm reached the little colony of
Russians, who were put there by their
Government to protect seal fishing.
FIGHT BLINDLY IX FOG.
A sudden volley cranhed Into the
band of poachers out of the dense sray
toe. Walter York, one of the Carmen
oita'M crevr, fell with a bullet through
hi* breast, and a bullet shattered the
arm of John Frledlander, another of
the poachers.
Jlcl,rno'Â» freebooter* returned the
fire and m fierce battle In the mist en
nurd. Â»ltber side co'nld see the
-other* A sbout, a groan or a shot
brought n uplutterlnfi: volley. McLean
and biÂ« poachers were gradually driv
en to their boat and only a feÂ«r MkJns
were obtained.
This disaster did not discourage Mc-
Lean. A cargo of sealskins meant over a
quarter of a million dollars. A cargo of
Eealskins was what he started for and,
"By the gods, he was going to get them."
The order was "Up anchoj^' and the Car
menclta headed for the Pribyloff Islands,
an American rookery.
Here the poachers had better luck.
They got sealskins valued at many thou
sandsâJust how much the authorities are
not able to sayâ and put in at Victoria.
How the skins were disposed of is an
other storyâ one that the .federal officials
are not yet aole to tell. \
The doings of McLean in the regions
where Kipling cays "There is no law of
God or man" somehow got to the ears
of the Mexican Government, whose flag
the Carmencita flew. The nag was or
dered canceled and the register was tak
en away. W..J. Wood was the one who
surrendered the register.
McLean, by this proceeding, was made
â¢ plraÂ«e In the eyes of all Governments.
He applied in vain to the - Nicaraguan
Government for permission to use its
flag. Finally he decided, it seems, that
he needed no flag. -
During March of thi^ year the Carmen
dta, with the name changed to the Aca
pulco, put Into Drake's Bay. There*, she
was provisioned and obtained another
crew for "codflshlng" near Victoria, and
sailed away.
Now the Carmendta Is believed to be
somewhere in the Bering Sea with a crew
armed to the teeth and eager to do the
bidding of Captain McLean, the pirate.
From the tales that come from the land
of the Northern Lights, McLean does not
care whether he takes the skins from the
seals or from a warehouse. He Is as
reckless in regard to the lives of others
as he is cf his own.
WILL BUS DOWN PIRATE.
But the revenue cutter Bear is on the
way to scour the Bering Sea until tne pi
rate vessel is captured. For years McLean
has dodged revenue cutters and- S gxin
boats, but this time if seems certain that
the poacher will be caught. All his cun
ning will avail nothing this time. Posi
tive evidence against him is in the hands
cf the Federal authorities and the orders
are. It Is understood, to take McLean,
dead or alive. . â¢ " . ;
The evidence against McLy-an and his
accused co-consplrators was gathered by
Secret Service Agent Harry M. Mofflt.
Deepite the strenuous denials of .Wood,
Woodside and Tyson, Mofflt declares that
the evidence shows that the three helped
to outfit the Carmencita for her. illegal
cruise. {
J. F. bcott.' a Custom house broker, la
one of the principal witnesses for the
Government. He was at rirst thought to
be the owner of the; vessel, but it was
found that he was only acting -for the
real owners. :.
"Yes. I did have. something to do with
the Carmencita." he admitted yesterday
"I cannot say just what it was now be

A. BACHELOR
ADVICE TO UNENGAGED GIRLS
IT Is Impossible not to admire the enterprise, of the mod
ern young woman. No longer is she: satisfied .with, fol
lowing the example of her mother and grandmother, who
were quite content if they acquired a good knowledge of
housekeeping, sewing and knitting. Bhe has far greater
ambitions. There are "so many fields of employment open
to the weaker sex nowadays, in one of which,. at least, the
average girl feels that she must exercise her : particular
talents. ' .
With this end In view she studies and learns, and proba
bly makes considerable advancement In the realisation of
her ambitions. People commence to talk of- her as an ex
ceedingly clever girl capable of holding her own in .this
world of competition, and likely to make! a real success of
life, etc.," etc Her girl friends admire, envy, or, feel jeal
ous of her according to their natures, and try to copy her
example.
All this adulation is. of course, very nice, but It will
generally be noticed that the majority of young men are
not so appreciative of a girl's cleverness. They admire her
up to a certain point, but no further.' That Is to say, they
are willing to admit of her cleverness, but beyond that she
is uninteresting to them. Placed side by side i. with her less
clever sisters, the talented girl does not. ir^ their opinion,
by any means cast thd former's attractions into the shade
on account of her. exceptional Intellect. , >
In fact, there are few men who are. attracted for any
length of time tpward the clever girl. She may be pretty
and vivacious, but there is that about ; her which makes
men keep thei/ distance. For Instance, - men have that
authoritative and opinionated manner which the clever girl
is apt to adopt. .Men don't. In the least, \u25a0 mind a woman's
sweet, simple' conceit, say. with regard to her good looks,
but they do dislike the woman who is in love with her own
intellect and ability, and never fails to show It.
As a man once remarked In the writer's hearing, a
clever ;glrl generally makes the mistake of .airing her
brains too much, which causes a man to f eel sniall and. ig
norant at times. Of course, a man Is considered exceed
ingly foolish who deserts a good-looking, brilliant girl for
Â«,- simple-minded maiden whose.chlef delight may be em
broidery or stringing beads and experimenting with cook
ery. But he troubles little about such remarks, or he haÃ
probably got his heart's desire, I. c., a sweetheart who has
none of thOÃe brilliant talents which will not allow her to
appreciate and praise his own.
Mere feminine brains never really charmed the heart of
any man. Robert Browning fell in love with Elisabeth
Barrett because of her .big eyes, her clustering ringlets,
her little" hands and her great " capacity for admiring his
poetry. If she had never written a line herself he would
have loved her just the same. â¢ What a man likes. is femin
inity first and advanced intellect second. Sympathy counts
ten times more, heavily than book; learning. * '
Take the case of a certain prominent woman journalist,
for instance. I She is a brilliant | writer of articles and es
says, and is in receipt of a very comfortable income. When
I once> sighed enviously over her literary achievements she
shook her head rather doubtfully, drew her-leyes up In a
funny little -smile, half sardonic, half pathetic, and said:
"Do you-: know, my :dear,. I never, had^ a love -affair in
my life, and I ammore than 40 years of age." , \ "
' There was downright tragedy in that simple, smiling
confession, which any woman of imagination should appre?.
elate. To put it plainly, men do not like her vpry. well.'
while with her own sex she Is decidedly popular. WÂ« all
know that a woman's woman and a man's woman are two
totally different persons.' . ' r -\l.
The greatest objection men have to cleverjgirls is that
they do not consider they, would make good wives fijom a
domestic point -of view, in their opinions a girl, can not
combine domesticity with ambitious desires. iPeople'make
a mistake In saying that men are jealous of any clever
talents which a girl displays, and would not marry: her
because they were; not fond of mental. superiority in their
wives. -.'.*: '
A man is usually proud to acknowledge a clever. girl
as his friend and would, . in all probability, be only too
willing and anxious: to make her something more dear to
him if he did not possess that dread that when she became
his wife she would allow her ambitions to Interfere with
domestic duties. \u0084
Sometimes it happens that a girl's ambitions In no way
appeal to a man. He nnds'lt Impossible to interest him
self to any. extent In. her .work, arid recoKnises that without
mutual sympathy with one another's tastes 'marriage is apt
to become a failure. Of . course, cWVer girls do sometimes
meet arid marry men who are* in; sympathy with their tal
ents, and find true happiness." But it is not every man who
can talk enthusiastically of music andt art to the girl who
wishes to win professional honors. ; What: men really do
admire is the real, lovely, lovable, womanly woman. She
knows Â£he things which .man 'most appreciates and the
value of, domestlo knowledge 'through home experience. â

Good Temper and Politeness
- Â» CORRESPONDENT, writes to ask me. 'Is good ter
n per the essence of politeness?" Good temper as an
J- AÂ« evidence of a kindly nature unquestionably makes!lt
easier for its possessor to be polite, but there would proba
t-'v be more credit due the man who did not have a good
tamper, and still contrived to keep himself polite.
Good temper Is born in one as an individualâ or, at
least, the tendency Is. It is temperamental, just as a quick
temper ov quick sympathy or any number of things may
be. Capable of development, due to surroundings, influ
tnced by a thousand external and internal things, the fact
remains that it Is much" easier for. certain people to have
kindly feelings and do the' deeds moving â from them than
for others. .' --\u25a0
But politeness is a matter of education and environ- r
ment: Lady Mary Wortley Montague's statement that she
had been everywhere, and always found men and women,,
"in a summing up of the fact that, while some -nations ex
hibit much more politeness than others, there Is just about
the same average of humanity all over -the world. '; ,
In Italy. the f people are so uriiformly-well'mannered that
no single class can be said to be morelpolite than another.
It Is almost as true of France and Spain as" of Italy.
In Japan there is no, such thing as lack of manners ex
cept among those 'spoiled by contact with mannerless Amer
icans Â»arid Europeans. But to \ say that i among those na
tions i there is more good temper than in the United States,
except as' external expressions of feeling Influence, thought,
is to run counter to general experience. Surely 'there can
never be a better tempered gathering, than an American
crowd out for sightseeing or a holiday.
The good manners of the *were as remarkable
during the renaissance as they* are to-day. But one has
enly to; read- an open account of* life during that most in
teresting time, something like Benvenuto Cellini's autobiog
raphy, to \ learn that more : than one I fiendish temper, bad
enough to be diabolical, went. with a distinction of manner
and exhibitions of politeness such as the wdrld. has never
surpassed.': ; :, â¢-\u25a0 ~t- -\u25a0. , --\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0-\u25a0 : \u25a0 . "7" 7 -
Orientals generally. have a disregard of human life that
we cannot couple with, good temper at all; yet throughout
the east the best mannered of" Caucasians are quarreled
with in. secret for their lack of politeness. ;
-True 'politeness, that; moving ;from -kindliness, will be
found; most often sin those of . good temper; but the polite
ness which the world is accustomed \u25a0 to take at its face
value is rather.a question of. training and environment.

IF there be much prejudice against republics still existing among
monarchial governments in Europe it will have good opportunity
to declare itself in the replies given to the special envoys which
Norway has decided to send out asking the powers for recognition
of her diplomatic and consular service. If there be refusal to grant
the request the reasons stated for doing so would no doubt cleverly
conceal any dislike of encouraging the formation of new republics,
even though the prejudice against them might strongly influence
that negative decision. As Norway has declared an intention to
fight for independence if it be not yielded peacefully the existence
of any undercurrent of prejudice might cause war. The prompt
recognition of the new nation by foreign powers would probably
decide Sweden to use no warlike coercion a,nd not even to hold out
long against a peaceable separation.
It seems regrettable that Sweden's King should have, stood
out so stubbornly against the contention of the 'Norwegian
Storthing that the two countries might remain in union and yet be
separate in the systems of consular service under which as united
the smaller country had; suffered. The gain of strength in union
might thus -have been held, and the improved prosperity of Norway
under the system of a separate consular service might in the course
of years have added to the greatness of Sweden. It is to be noted
that the Riksakt, the Norwegian charter of 1814, establishing funda
mental laws at the time she voluntarily joined provides
that the union be indissoluble and irrevocable, .without prejudice
of separate government, constitution and code of laws' of either
Sweden or Norway. According to that Norway, seems strictly
within her rights in the demand the Storthing made for ther separate
consular laws, but she would not be within her rights in asking
for disunion from Sweden if Sweden would live up to the Riksakt's
provision for a difference in a law or code of laws. ,

In the June World's: Work there is .a
striking new portrait of Thomas A. Edi
son. In connection with it, In an article
on "The Modern Profession of Invent
ing," is told the following incident:
In the practice of his profession Mr.
Edison has to save time, Is a
pretty ' well developed suspicion among
his assistants that his deafness is largely
a ruse to avoid hearing things that he
does not care'to^pay attention to. When
Mr. Edison sat for the photograph at the
front of this magazine, in one of â¢ the
poses his eyes were dropped, looking at
his hands. It was a time exposure, and
the instant the' shutter "of the camera
closed with a click he looked up and ex
claimed, "Over exposed." His attorney
shouted to him:
. "Did you hear that click?"
!'Eh?"
"How did you know that he had fin
ished that exposure?"
"Oh, I had an intuition."
"INTUITION."
True, vegetarians may be. often are,
good men; but no one will contend that
they are Jolly. For steady companionship
the redoubtable feeders are to be pre
ferredâmen whom neither roast nor pud
ding can* intimidate. Who would ' not
choose to hold cheerful converse with the
matchless eupeptic, Sydney Smith; rather
than sit under the glooming of the sat
urnine Carlyle, whose digestion was
wrecked- by simple porridge? Never was
there a more efllcient stomach "than that
of the. merry parson, the habitual diner
out, whose buoyant spirits. and good hu
mor always charmed. . Hla ' brilliant wit
prevented his elevation to tf bishopric, but
It made him .^an ever- welcome v and domi
nant guest at thetcbles of the great.
Contrast with' this' bright spirit the scold-
Ing Carlyle, who disliked eating almost
as much as he disliked his friends. The
difference was chiefly -ue to their diverse
views of the matter of eating. Lord Hol
land went so far as to assert that "some
men are better and abler than others be
cause they eat more."
It- is fortunate for the race that,
whether they admit it or not, whether
they know It or not, most persons live
mainly to eat, and show little concern
about tht" nutritive -value of their food.
They eat what they like, as far as they
can afford It.â Atlantic." 'Â«.

pv RESIDENT ROOSEVELT chose the proper moment for
l \-r taking the initiative in the movement for peace between Rus
> sia and Japan. It was the moment when the ' moderation of
Tapan would stand in contrast to the great advantage of her military
position. As against Russia she is the mistress of the .Eastern
seas. v Her antagonist can send no more fleets to contest the situa
tion. In addition to this, the armies of Oyama no. doubt have the
entire force of Linevxtch enveloped, with Harbin and Vladivostok
at the mercy of Japan; â¢ v .]
Any western nation under such circumstances would harden its
terms of peace. Germany did it with France. But Japan, wins the
confidence of the world by a moderation as commendable as it is
unusual. She goes not a hair's breadth beyond her purpose at the
beginning of the war, which was to protect her national existence.
This she will do by safeguarding Manchuria, taking over the
railroad she has captured, retaking Saghalien Island, and exacting
:n cash only the cost of the war as an indemnity.
President Roosevelt looked far ahead in his overture. He put
a condition in it that is of vast importance to the future peace- of
the world, by insisting that the settlement must bt directly between
Tapan and Russia. This not only saves the pride of both
and perhaps paves the way for their future friendship, but it shuts
nut the pernicious intermeddling of the continental nations, which
look for themselves the fruits of Japan's victory over China. If
the President had left this point open, the European nations, which
dilly-dallied and left the initiative to him, would even by this time
be "to the fore with impertinent interference. But he absolutely
concluded that issue. His statement is in accord with public senti
ment in the United States. Our people want Japan to have the
fruits of her victory, and any move to prevent this, no matter by
what nations undertaken, will be understood as unfriendly to the
United States and therefore impossible of success. .
The combatants have fought each other unaided, except for the
stretching of neutrality by France in favor of her northern ally, and
the strong hand of the President has restricted the settlement to
-them alone. Japanese policy and diplomacy show with great and
attractive quality, by what appears to be the entire absence of a
spirit of dicker and bargain. That Government has not begun by
asking much more than it intends taking in oitier to drop in meeting
the views and objections of Russia. On the contrary, Japan asks
in the beginning just what she expects to get, and her diplomacy
has that quality of directness which the United States shows in all
of it^ international dealings.
The wisdom of this is apparent. The world contrasts Japan's
position of power in the field with her moderation in the terms of
settlement, and if Russia refuse and Japan have to strike the firtfel
blow, she and not her enemy will have all the advantage of
friendly public opinion throughout the world. If these moderate
terms are not accepted, and Harbin and Vladivostok fall, the nations
will be unable to criticize Japan for hardening her conditions, which
she will have the right to do.
The 'position of the United States in 'the Orient is immensely
strengthened by President Roosevelt's initiative and its success.
This country and Japan will be the ruling powers in the Pacific.
Between them there can be no misunderstanding. Japan's war in
demnity will unburden her credit and make her financial position
among the strongest. Devoting her energies to the pursuits of
peace, she will be to us and our commerce in the Pacific what the
British isles have been to us and our Atlantic trade, our best cus
tomer and most useful neighbor. As she is the ally of England, the
three nations will be drawn close together in the commerce and
politics of Eastern Asia, and there will arise a-new dreibundthat
will preserve the peace and promote the prosperity of the .Orient.
President Roosevelt has accomplished a present result dear to
the lovers of peace. He has compelled justice in a settlement, given
continental Europe notice of a non-interference policy, and has built
wisely for his own country and the world. .It is the opening chapter
in the new diplomacy, and it is a happy circumstance that the Presi
dent has identified the first entry of the United States upon that
large field with the interests of peace and the tranquillity of man
throughout the world. His countrymen and the people of the na
tions recognize and commend his service.

FRENCH SCHOOLS
There were recently vacancies for four
clerks In the office of the Prefect of tha
Seine, says F. A. Vanderllp In Scribner"s.
For these four > positions there were reg
istered 4338 applicants. Washington at Its
worst surely has nothing comparable ito
that. Every one of these; 4000 applicants,
however, could. have passed an examina
tion along. certain stereotyped lines which
would have 'delighted the hearts of our
civil service reformers.
The French system of education is in
tensely national. Its .plan is exactly- tha
opposite from our own school system.
With iia the local community controls
primary schools. In France the local com
munity has no voice in the matter. Tha
French system Is the most centralized,
the most strictly regulated, the most
autocratic and the farthest removed from
democratic ideas of any school system In
existence.
-The exact uniformity of the schools la
almost unbelievable. The Minister of In
struction, sitting in bis office in Paris,
can tell ai any moment Just what fabla
of La Fontaine each child of a certain
age | throughout the whole of France. Is
reciting.. Teachers are not allowed any

"GOODMAN."
There was a man In town tha other day
who formerly worked to Atchlson for
JlOO.a month, says the Atchison. Globe.
He now receives a salary of $10,000 a year,
and he doesn't work as hard as he did
when he lived In Atchlson.
\u0084 This man is. no great genius: he Is
simply a "good man," and C there ara>
thousands of suchrl' Being a "good man"
means that a man. ls, lndustrious, loyal,
intelligent and well-behaved. 'â¢\u25a0 It is easier
to be a "good * man" . than It is to be a
bad one. There is a scarcity of "good

Mrs. Smith maintains that the police
of the city are trying to hush up the af
fair. She says that just before her death
Mrs. Merrill became a Catholic, and that
on her deathbed she signed a written
confession and sent it to a Mrs. Coolidge,
mother of one of her vistima, who lived
in Boston. On receiving the letter Mrs.
Coolidge became a raving , maniac, and
for this reason the confession never was
placed in the hands of the police. . Mrs.
Smith also declares that there are others
besides herself who know of the story,
and that they. will corroborate her testi
mony aa soon as the investigation is
begun.
POLICE DISCREDIT TALC
The police of this city place little,cred
ence in the tale of Mrs. Smith in which
she tells' of the murders committed by
her alleged foster mother. Captain Bur
nett 6aid yesterday afternoon that he had
withdrawn Detective Ed* Gibson from
further investigation. From what he has
Been he seems to regard the story as the
mere babblings of a weak-minde4 woman
who has a grievance weighit^ *n her
brain. Chief Dinan has the same iheory
lo offer. "Even if It were true," he said,
"there is nothing to be done now. Ac
cording to the woman's own statement
all of the people who were concerned Jr<
the alleged murders are dead, and there
is no one for us to arrest now." Mrs.
Smith was at the Hall of Justice again
yesterday afternoon urging the authori
ties to make ' a complete investigation of
her weird story and not let the "public
think that she was a liar," as she ex
pressed it to Chief Dinan.
Captain George Green, who died
years ago in the tale of Mrs. Smith, Is
very much alive. He is a captain em
ployed with the Morse system. of patrol.
For a number of years he was an em
ploye of the city and later he was a
special officer in . the Emporium. He
has been with the , Morse agency for
the past twenty-two years.
"I was thunderstruck," he said yes
terday ; afternoon, "to j see â¢ that murder
ous story of ; Mrs. Smith. It must be
caused by an inordinate desire. for. re
venge on her: part or else she is a vic
tim of insanity. It is awful, though, to
so malign the dead when they have no
power to defend themselves.' Were she
a man I would commit assault, but
against such a woman a man is power
less to act. She may want money for
all I know, but she will never get any
from our "family.
CAPTAIN GREEN OFFERS PROOF.
"I knew Mrs. Smith, May. we used to
call her, when she first came into the
family of Mrs. Merrill, my mother-in
law.' She was never adopted, but was a
sort of servant in the house. Bhe did
a little work and received her board In
return.' But she was a bad little girl,*
fond of lying, and very light fingered.
Finally she' got so bad that Mrs., Mer r
rill had her sent to the Magdalen Asylum
for the correction of such children.
That was the last that I saw of her for
a long time. In the meantime I had
married one of the daughters of .Mrs.
Merrill and we were all living together
at the Poet-street residence, where. all
of the: murders are supposed to have
occurred. ; '
Yesterday the woman gave a new
motive for ber long silence and ber
sudden resolution to inform the police
of the terrible crimes. She now says
that one of her former husbands,
whose name she steadfastly refuses to
give, knew of the awful series of homi
cides, and that he came to her some
time ago and told her that if she did
not disclose her knowledge to the po
lice he would do it for her. She
asserts that she wants no money from
anybody, and that she only spoke to
relieve her mind of its horrible bur*
den.
The police are paying no serious at
tention to tbe sensational story 3lrs.
Ida May Smith told them on Monday
rejeardiner three alleged murders in v
bouse on Post street thirty-five ycurs
ago, and In tlic llnht of evidence ' that
developed, yesterday the g-rewsoine tale
In filled with improbabilities. Captain
Green, who Mrs. Smith aald wan
dead, la a live and hustlinj? de
tective, and be cornea forward with
proof that neema conclusive to show
that MrÂ». Smith hua invented . the
Â«tart llus account of j horrible murders.
Qrcen was married to MisÂ» Joule Mer
rill, daughter of tbe woman to whose
hands Mra. Smith lays the revolting
Crimea. The daughter waa a young
lady when Slra. Smith was living- In
the Merrill home and could, not . have
been the playmate of Mrs. Smith, us
Is . alleged, who Was then a child. Mrs.
Merrill waa of very small atature and
physically unable to do foul murder aa
is ascribed to her. The authorities
have therefore come to the . conclusion
that no welffht in to be attached to
Mrs. Smith'a story, and Captain dreen
unhenltatlna-lr declares that she la
either lnsaae or Is seeking to levy
blackmail.

The fiiSCcrenpe in the number of cars
formerly collected upon and the number
upon which licenses will be imposed, be
ginning with the quarter starting from
July 1 next, will net the city an additional
sum. of more than (1000 from that source
alone or In excess of $4000 yearly. In
figuring the number of cars those actu
ally used or capable of being used are
reckoned by the license deputy. Of course
those cars In such a condition that they
are not to be utilized are not levied upon.
Even at that It has been learned that the
company Is using now at least 250 cars
more than It has . been paying licenses
upon.
Scott has ascertained that the corpora
tion Is assessed for a much larger num
ber of cars than that upon which the
licenses are imposed. His deputy has
been counting the cars for two weeks,
and has found more than 800. His labors
In that regard will not be completed until
the end of this month, when it Is ex
pected that he will have succeeded in
crediting the company with the posses
sion of at least Â£50 of the 'cars.
Former Tax Collector Smith was lenient
toward the corporation in that con
nection, and licenses were collected by
him on but 550 cars. The license on each
car is $15 per year or $3 75 per quarter.
For the present quarter the sum of $2075
was collected from the corporation by
Smith personally a short time before he
absconded, and that amount figures in
the total sum appropriated by the ex-Tax
Collector.
Tax Collector Scott has detailed one of
his deputies to count the number of cara
owned and operated by the United Rail
roads.

\ Foreman Andrews of the '; Grand v Jury
says he \u25a0 has \ evidence 'of } attempts by', the
city administration to \ tamper with civil
service/. Documentary evidence Â£In . his
possession involves the Mayor's secretary,
George ;B. Keane. < who 1 it ; also*' a' State
Senator. Two letters .bearing - his sig
nature and addressed, to the Civile Service
Commissioners , constitute ; the "evidence. - .
i In these letters ; Keane recommends the
appointment of George - J. '{ Moore and
George .T. Will. This Foreman -Andrews
declares is in violation of all ' the '\u25a0 ethics
of civil . service. v - ' v ,
: "This sort of thing Is outrageous," the
foreman declared. - "It is a blow at ' the
principles of civil service. It will ' not be
tolerated." : : V J ..

demand | a full explanation of this " action
of ,"?â¢ Keane. -Andrews -; will :' ascertain
whether or not : appointments \ have ; been
made at any time to 'civil : service po
sitions -on such "recommendations."
.Another bit* of \u25a0 documentary ; evidence
against Keane was found among the ef
fects of Edward J. Smith, the absconding
Tax ; Collector. It is 'a ; demand on -A.
Koehler; a collection agents for payment
of his municipal, license. ;: On ; it : is written
in Keane's handwriting, "Koehler- is,

."When questioned : In 'regard to this
Keane â¢ declared that he had spoken for

In . hard luck. , ;_; _ '
"But," - explained . Foreman Andrews
yesterday, ; "on investisrÂ«.tlon" we -found
that" KoehleV i was ~a| remarkably >: lively

Immediately following the making

official declared three minutes still re
mained. The . referee decided in favor
of the red and white, and the game was
recommenced. The'Commercial,' ln over
eagerness, committed a breach in the
regulations. Miss Eva'jMoldrup upon
the free' throw thus given .;tledÂ« the
score. 'Following the last -throw both

day and had Fltz been given perfect

moved him along with a sacrifice.

LATONIA SELECTIONS.
Corbett made an excellent impression
here and appeared like a champion \ In
every. round. He hooked ;and . jabbed
Thompson at will and drove him to. the
ropes on numerous- occasions. His
blocking was good and: his: foot work
carried him out of all danger. Several
times he caught ; Thompson on the jaw
with right and left - swings and â¢ got
away without; a return.- Although not
in the best of condition he left the ring
as strong as when he entered it.:
- It was a good clean fight and Thomp
son surprised even his friends when he
knocked* Corbett down In- the second
round. The little Denverlte had rushed
Thompson and was caught ..with a
swing while off his balance." He was up
in a second,, however," and j fighting: like
a demon. ' Corbett carried "the fight , to
his opponent in every; round ". and , landed
some terrific swings that" would have
knocked out any ordinary man. Thomp
son, withstood them until the middle of
the tenth round. .: 'â¢

She was sixty-eight steaming days com

uneventful, fine weather being encoun

before entering the Straits of Magellan.-
The Hazel Dollar 1b of 2SM registered
tonnage. She is S7O feet long. 50 feet
beam and her hold is 26 feet deep. Her
cemmander. Captain Alexandar Gow, is
*ell known here. He superintended her
construction, brought her safely out from
the old world and will continue in charge
of her. - ' . - .
The bisr freichter Ha2el Dollar, built
on the Clyde for the Dollar Steamship
Company of this port, arrived yesterday
afternoon, and this morning will begin
discharging at Oakland long wharf the
6000 tons of Etecl rails t>he brought from
Rotterdam. Having been cradled in Brit
ish waters the Hazel Dollar, although
owned here, Is barred from the honor ot
flying the stars and stripes, and the
blood red ensign of merry England float
ing over her stern proclaims her a Brit
ish tramp
The steamer is well equipped to
make her wandering career yield golden
returns to her owners. She la a large
carrier, has a moderate appetite for coal
and on a reasonable supply of fuel can
jog along at a twelve-knot gait In what
ever of the world's waters the demands
of commerce may require her to go. The
6000 tons of steel rails now In her hold
-may be taken as a measure of what she
can do in the weight carrying line.
Though adapted for any kind of freight
excepting bulk fluids the Ha?el Dollar is
fitted specially for carrying lumber, of
which she can accommodate about 3,500,
009 feet. Ehe is equipped with the gear
for rapid handling of earco of any kind.
On account of her British origin, fhe is
barred from trading between United
States ports, but it tsÂ« expected that she
will carry from the northern forests to
Panama much of the lumber used-in the
construction of the Isthmian canal.
May Soon Be Chartered

Louis Ravlni. a brother of th* les
see, said that he was a "runner" <or
the hotel 'â¢ and that It -was always
crowded until the police raided it; then '
the business fell off to almost nothing.
Affidavits of the -police were read to.
the effect' that the place was fitted up
as a house of ill fame. An adjourn
ment until to-day was then taken.
A man about 4S- years old, of dartt
complexion, curly hair and a flowing
black mustache owns the premises at
620 Jackson" street, conducted "as a
resort *t or fallen, women, and which
the lessee, Sebastian Ravlnl. seeks to
keep golnsr despite the desire of thÂ«
Grand Jury to close It. This fact was
brought out yesterday during the hear
ing of Ravlnl's petition for a writ of
Injunction agralnst the police,* and It Is
as near the ownership of the place as
the District Attorney, who appears for
the defense, could set.
Rairlnl Csm GoÂ«i to Trial, but Dlstrlcf

R. E. Hutton & Co.. 490 California street,
Ean Francisco, members of the New York
Btoek Exchange, furnish the following official
Quotations of that Exchange:
London market availed itself of this oppor
tunity this morning to sell about 30,000 shares
of American stocks in New .York. The definite
abandonment of any speculative revival on ac
count of the peace negotiations immediately
followed. The professional el-ement I thereupon
proceeded to take steps to undo what they had
done yesterday and' on' Saturday. The bear
operators who had been driven to cover pro
ceeded to renew their short contracts and the
small professional commitments on the long
side were thrown | over again. Some of the
newer phases ot the Equitable Life affair were
not wholly relished in stock market circles,
notably the general arraignment, of conditions
in the life insurance contained in Former
President Cleveland's acceptance of the trus
teeehip. ThÂ» crop bulletin of the Weather
Bureau received an unfavorable interpretation
In the commodities, markets.',' The conditions
reported for corn and cotton were considered
unsatisfactory, while mucli was made of the
disappointing -yield reported from the Winter
wheat btlng harvested', and tbe' improved con
dition of Spring wheat was practically ignored.
The increase shown in the May exports of agri
cultural products of nearly $22,000,000 over
May of last year did not help the market.'-".
' The uninterrupted ease ruling In- the money
market took the subject practically out of
consideration. Another payment by the sub
treaeury of $500,000 on account 'of a telegraphic
transfer from San Francisco marked' the fur
ther return of funds recently transmitted to
that DOint on account of the American Smelt
ing Company's purchases. The stock market
showed no effective power toward recovery and
though the last prices were not in Â«J1 cases at
the lowest point, the close was easy. â¢ ...
Bonds were heavy. Total sales, par value,
$3,485,000. ' " >\u25a0\u25a0;,

and*the discomfort of Gunsmith Wollam
has^grown worse.;
A week ago Wollam appeared before
the health officer at the City Hall, with
his tale of woe. He t'olfl how strong, the
odor was and how Indifferent the Mon
golians were to the health of the Amer
ican residents. He was .assured > that
steps would b<?'taken immediately to rem
edy the situation. r . ; .". :- \u25a0'. " ? .-;=.-
Days passed,! however, and no repre
sentative of the city cleansers appeared.
Wollam grew angry and his health worse.
Meanwhile the roomers 'in^th'e.Tremont
were moving away tomore sanitary; quar
ters and the manager "found that even
his oldest lodgers would \not stand the,
fishdryer. Then Manager Wood called up
the Board of Health/by telephone and was
promised that" stringent , measures would
be taken to suppress the fishdryer. .Wood
also was doomed, to disappointment, for
.the foul conditions yet exist.

Trask boasts that he has often made
similar runs without capture, and says
he would have got away but for fear
some one would shoot him. He belongs in
Los Angeles. He will be charged with
robbery.
A youth about twenty-four years of age
pursued by Detective George McMahon,
Special Officer Cleary and a Chinese yell
ing at the top of his voice, rushed down
Washington street from Fish alley
shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon. In a twinkling 200 or 300 people
joined in the chase. The youth, followed
by his pursuers, turned into Dunbar alley
et the rear of the Hall of Justice, thence
into Merchant street.
George A. Crandall. driver of the patrol
wagon at the Central Police Station, at
this point joined in the chase and over
took the fugitive in an alley that runs
between Washington a"nd Jackson streets
below Montgomery- Crandall was
promptly joined by McMahon, who soon
had handcuffs on the youth, and took
him to the City . Prison, where he gave
the name of F\ink Trask.
Low Jung, wh"b has a nsh stand in Fish
alley, was counting his silver coin,
\u25a0which he was putting into a sack, when
Trask made a grab and got some of the
coin.

Ther* is no limitation upon the power of
your board to fix the minimum wage and
the maximum hours of service of laborers.
As to other employe*, not laborers, they ar4
entitled to the benefits of the holiday provis
ions without loss of salary and it is the duty
of the various departments to make provisiop
accordingly for the relief of all permanent
per diem employee, whether I their salaries are
n'xed by the charter or by the heads of ouch
departments.
Any or.? who occupies a position under the
Classified civil sen-ice is not a â¢â¢laborer" and
is not subject to the control, of the Board of
Supervisor!" as to compensation, the power
OÂ» that board to fix compensation of employes
being limited strictly to those known as
laborers. Furthermore the charter specifically
rrovides that the compensation of , employes
bhall be fixed by the various departments by
which they are employed when such com
pensation has not been axed by the charter
Itself.
As to such ncr diem employes the proposed
ordinance Is -unnecessary as the object therein
eoujiht is already obtained. But as to em
ployes not laborers whose services are tem
porary from day to day. the holiday provisions
of section 10 ot the Political Code do not
apply and your, board is without power to make
any such provisions, directly or indirectly, â¢in
their favor.
City Attorney Long yesterday advised
the Board of Supervisors In an opinion
that, a proposed ordinance designed to
give per diem or hourly employes of the
city the benefits of the Saturday . half
holiday law would be valid if qmended so
as to become applicable to laborers only.
