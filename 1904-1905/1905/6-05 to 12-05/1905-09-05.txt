Will J. French, president of the Labor

OonadaOaÃari Stafford, who spoke on
union labor insurance. In part he said:
U is tny purjv&e lo give you. briefly Â«c poÂ»
Â»:ble, the racts cenctrning the modern ten
ancy U organized labor to provide life in
surance und sic* and accident benefits tor -ta
members. Twenty years ago the payaaj ai
ir.y Urge manuracturing tstabiishment or
rai"lroa<; terminus inevitably produced one or
more subscrtvtlun ysts. started by the per
sonal friends o: thos^ in lmmt<iiate need.
Sometimes the plea was in behalf of the
*idow or orphans of a man who had betn sua
flenlr killed by car* or machinery; eometlmes
tor the entire famiiy on account of lingering
tic-knot* of the bread-w.nner.
Thtfee nevtr failtd. to mccl with a hearty
respont* and were frequently supplemented by
m. substantial contribution from the employer.
The ttcaay increaee in the demand made this
method unsatisfactory from evtry etandpolnt.
"Tie appeal to the worker* became monoto
nously regular "and insistent, while the aid 10
the needy nas necessarily In the Individual
case, but temporary and insufficient.
SUBSTITUTION APPROVED. y
The wore thoughtful members of the^ national
organization*- began to advocate the eubst.tu
tlon of a tystent of compulsory life Insurance
for the prevto'ou. temporary relief. This met
with the approTkt -of the membership gener
ally, and alro aaturaliy evol\-ed similar ar
rangements for elck, accident and funeral
btuefits: and there h*e been up to the pnsent
"a steady and consistent growth along these
lines, with n*ufts that are aetonl?h;ng in their
magnitude. No dpubt every member of a
labor union Is fully conversant with the pro
visions ior his own organlration. but few men,
however, are familiar with the conditions in
all organizations. ..â¢'.'? '
1 have ir. \u25a011 able to obtain the positive
figures showing the number who carry Insur
ance, etc.. and the amount carried from an
incomplete State union membership of SI.ISB
m<.mbers. No attempt has been made at this
time to estimate the total union membership
at the' State nor the complete life Insurance
npures. I merely give the results ' deduced
Ii om the data already at hand.
The following divisions are made along the
lines adopted by thÂ« offlclals of the Federal
Government In their census reports and may
n*it exactly accord with the divisions followed
by the uniont< themselves:

Andrew Furuseth was next Introduced,
President French* referring -ta him as one
of the stalwarLs of trade unionism in fair
weather and storm, and always alert." ln
part Mr. Furuseth said:
Any condition in society," no matter how pro
duced, which condition 'prevents a', healthy
family life, is destructive .- of humanity : and
Bhould be resisted. . " *
. The condition may -be inherent in the sys
tem, it may have been artificially created. by
legislation or by Judicial decisions. In either
cas* It is man's, sacred, duty to insist upon
such changes or remedies as shall put within
reach of the industrious father.: the power \u25a0 to
support a. family in health.'
The energies of existing society are â¢ devoted
to the production of wealth for â¢ sale. The
struggle between Individual firms, communities
and nations is to produce wealth so cheaply: as
to be able to undersell any other. , â¢ V â¢ . .
The fundamental principle of American law 1
is that there shall be no property rights '. in
man. A man's labor: power Is . part of him ;
It fluctuates with bis health; decreases when
be grows old, and ceases at his deaths It can- j
not -be divorced from man and therefore under

president as with , forceful ;\u25a0 words ,he de
scribed the: cause' of antagonism between
workers and' those who^ employ them.
President :. Wheeler declared , that the
present tendency, unquestionably Is to put
upon- fhe industrial ; walls the . glaring
placard. "No one admitted except on
business!". , According? to . the '^ speaker
"sheer, force'; of machinery^ threatens "to

WHEELER'S' ADDRESS.'
The substance of the difficulty in the present
Social situation is this: \u25a0 Our nation has grown
so big, the adminfetration'of '. wealth ', has be
come so rapidly ' concentrated ; and reduced to
*uch perfect mechanical operation, the various
Interests of the different employments and
classes of - our population have through \u25a0 the
â¢ modern \u25a0 ease of communication . been embodied
In organizations so manifold and so firm, that
sheer forcer of machinery, the battalion drill of
organization threatens to take the place of
Justice and reason, and arbitrary solutions the
place of sympathetic understanding* of thÂ»
other fellow's case. Must this machinery of
corporations and syndicates of banks and clear
ing-houses be allowed to banish flesh and blood
trom the world?; Must these barriers of organ
ization be suffered to check the transit. of hu
man charity, of human sympathy, and the
common- human s understanding? The present
tendency unquestionably- is to set upon the
walls the â¢ glaring placard: "No one admitted
except on business." - \u25a0 " , l a \v,'
J Behind -the r walls every \u25a0 one attends to hia
own - : interests , and r develops : his , own way- of
working..* From without comes no appreciative
attentions and \u25a0 no observation ' that can take
into account the real -motives and 'spirit of
what Is going ' on. It is a poor, way to test

AT FRUITVALE
OAKLAND, Sept. 4.â Unions affiliated
under the Central Labor Council of Ala
meda County celebrated Labor day with .
an outing: at Satro Park, Fruitvale. For
the entertainment of hundreds. of unlon
*lbts. their. frtend3, big and little folks,' thÂ«
various committees mode liberal provi
sion. The council's arrangements werÂ»
well" handled, and marked another suc
cessful observance of the day. ,
Games, dancing, a literary programme,
presentations and a general reunion wera
the events. Charles. W. Petry. financial -.
secretary of the council, was president
of the day. â¢ At the. literary exercises In
the pavilion held this afternoon President -
Petry welcomed the guests and. read a
letter from Jack London, absent from Ill
ness, who expressed sympathy with tho -
union labor movement. G. B. Benham of
the San Francisco Labor Council spoka
on ' phases of labor unionism. In tha
course of his address he said:
That which la for the success' of labor organ
izations Is for tha success of all labor, and as
labor succeeds so advance* all of mankind.
The people gauge the Intelligence of the worlt
lngman by hia ability to retain to himself tha
product of hia labor. Every step in the labor
union movement is directed to the' effort of
the laboring: man -to . deliver to himself his
rightful share of tha \u25a0 product of his labor, of
the wealth that his hands have created.
It is because labor organizations exist that
we are here to-day. It la because labor unions
exiet.that we. are able to say when we shall
commence work. and. to some extent, when
we shall, quit work. The stand that the labor
unions have taken la one that cannot only re
flect credit upon their members but upon the
country as .'a. whole. . â¢ \u25a0 .'â¢â¢\u25a0\u25a0 !
"CML Schmidt, first vice president of
the International Butcher Workmen, ar
gued for the labor union as a political
organization to win by political action,
rather, than by force measures of stiike.
boycott - and the like. He declared that
the,peace between Russia and Japan had
been prompted by commercialism, not
sentlmentalism. Schmidt maintained that
future wars would be governed by the
attitude of the worklngmen. In them, he
thought, the peace of the world was
bound up, because, he declared, those who
must do the fighting would decide
whether there should be war.

pavilion a series of games was conducted

In Spite of Wet However, 15,000 Work
ers March in New York City.
NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â Fifteen thousand
workers marched under streaming umbrel
las in New York's Labor day parade to
day. Although the rain poured with trop
Â«i~al profusion, only strict orders from the
(5;:lon leaders prevented an even larger
number of workers from walking through
the deep puddles which collected on the
asphalt of upper Fifth avenue. The mem
bers of the Waitresses' Union, who had
prepared .to march attired in white
dresses and shoes and carrying parasols,
were so determined to march in the pa
rade that It required a decree of the Cen
tral Federated Union declaring that ,It
was unbecoming for womea to tramp in
Eloppy streets to deter them. In the men's
unions not only did the workers march,
but many of them were followed by small
sons uniformed like their fathers.
An interesting part of the Labor day
observance was the laying of the corner
etone of the new Temple of Labor on
Eighty-fourth street, between -Second and
Third avenues. The new temple is . to be
an Imposing.' structure five stories in
height, aftd will cost 5120,000.

a. m. arfd were three and a half, hours
passing a given point Among the nota
bles near the head of the line was Cor
nelius P. Shea, leader of the recent big
strike of the teamsters in this city.
The parade was halted when it was
discovered that a teamsters' unicfn was
marching behind a non-union band.
Committees went into a conference on a
â¢treet corner. The trouble was adjusted
and the parade resumed.
The efforts of the . police to keep the
â¢treet clear for the parade resulted fn the
Â»i' idental shooting of Mrs. Anna Hopkins
iuJPfng an exchange of shots at Michigan
avenue and Madison [ street between the
police and a man who gave : his | name as
William Laska. When Laska was or
tered to get back into tne'erowd he drew
uniform, became involved in a quarrel
over a chew of tobacco and the men
fought a dual with canes, .which they
carried. Both broke their weapons to
pieces, and Lindsay finally fell to the
pavement from the punishment he had
received. At this juncture a third man
took a hand In the fight and rained
blows with his fist upon Godfrey's head.
The negro was finally knocked down,
and in falling struck his head against
the curb stone and was rendered in
sensible. He was taken to the hospi
tal, but the fracture of the skull was
not discovered, and the man died a
few hours later without regaining con
sciousness. The man who struck the

swung past the reviewing stand the-mem
bers of the council crowded ' the . boats |
and trains bound for Shell' Mound Park. J
There were few absentees in the line I
of march. Nearly every union was repre- j
sented to within a dozen or so of its full
strength. There was no display of gaudy
tinsel, there were little discrepancies in
the matter of uniform, but : the turnout
represented all of San Francisco's skilled
mechanics, and the sight was well worth
seeing.
Bands blared at the head of each union
and the throngs that lined the side
walks aided the noise with their cheers.
They were good-natured crowds, and ap
preciative. , .-
One of the floats that drew applause all
along the route was the one carried by
the Sign Painters' Union. It was a,yel

ties at Mare Island.
The float of the Lumber Clerks' Union
was, perhaps, the 'most distinctive and
unique in line. It was a stick of timber
seventy feet long and two reet thick. It
was carried on a truck. There was .al
most enough lumber In it to build \ a'
house. - ;â¢â¢\u25a0-\u25a0< -*yf '

float containing the tools of their trade.
The Electric Workers carried small in

On this day. set aside by Federal. and State

COMPARISON | OP ' CONDITIONS.
We need â¢ not go back [to ancient history. ! to
Egypt, Greece and Rome, in order to find a
fitting contrast to labor conditions of the pres
ent, neither is it necessary to picture the
gloom of medieval Europe ; . all ,we : need \u25a0\u25a0 is to
draw. back the curtain of yesterday! and s look
into the early history of our own country.
How would you; like a drudgery of. sixteen
ho^rs and a wage ' of ' about 50 cents \a j day?
That was the established rule in the New En*-"
land States a" hundred years ago. But-mechan
ics and laborers : came â¢ together and organized;
they > have continued to .organize, ever_ since,
and. their working hours.huve decreased .a nd
their wages . increased in ? proportion Sto their
organized- strength until to-day .we have over
a million building mechanics and , laborers in
the United States. '.working -eight hours; at a
minimum rate of ' wages ranging \u25a0 from $2 50
to $Â« a day..* i : " " .;. -. \
The shortening of the hours of labor is. in
itself !an -increase of pay,; with ' more time
for education. - and \u25a0 recreation. - The s shorter
work day . has been brought ' about solely as a
result of - the J work S carried \u25a0. on " by the â¢ trade
union, movement; â¢ it is humanity's- greatest
boon, . and If organized labor -had . accomplished
nothing else than | . the establishment* of 'the
eight-hour work I day it would be ample ' rea
son : for its * existence. - Labor la necessary ; -to

that. destroy* men and;wonten,' physically, in
tellectually and morally; adlsease thatâ like a
cancerâ sends a people ewlftly. to the national
graveyard..
LABOR DESERVES THANKS.
All humanity should this day, . with uncov
ered heads, give rejoicing thanks to organized
labor for the shorter work day, because it has
given us better men and women, more intelli
gent and patrotic citizens, and because it has
given . civilization a mlghtly. life upward and
onward.' - ' ... .. -.:\u25a0 <
The living wages enjoyed by laboring men
and working women* of to-day have -enabled
them to attain a hlghert standard of living, to
become property owners and freeholders, pos
sessed with a greater amount of independence
and manhood. But .'.. yesterday, the masses
dragged, along witl\. bended "backs looking into
the ground; to-day: they. walk with erect bodies
and uplifted heads looking into the heavens. ;j
- -The- word organize wrought "â¢ the "mir&cles. -
Wonderfully, great as these achievements of
organized , labor may be, they, are'- nevertheless

REVOLT OF THE JAPANESE
ARMY IS THREATENED.
Drunk With Victory, the Mikado's Warriors
May Declare for Continuance of War,
LONDON, Sept. 4.â Sinister reports are coming from the Asiatic main
land, relating to the situation in Japan. Whether the cables from the island
have been cut *or the Government has closed "avenues of Communication to
prevent the world, learning the real situation is not knowhi but for several
days no news has come from the empire. It is said the army in Manchuria
is clamoring for a continuance of the war. ;
NEW YORK. Sept. 4.â Sudden, clear
light was thrown to-day upon the present
extraordinary situation In Japan by a
New York war correspondent, who per
bonally knows the \iews of the foremost
men of that country and who started
from Japan before the peace envoys- met
in Portsmouth. This correspondent has a
special and minute knowledge of the con
oitlons In the Japanese army at present.
"The Mutsuhito dynasty is in peril," he
said. "When I left Japan the army and
the populace were passionately clamoring
for a great money indemnity as the first
element In the terms of peace. It is im
possible to express in words the intensity
of the feeling behind this demand. It was
hysterical. In the army peace without a
huge money indemnity was unthinkable.
*'l am speakinc moderately when
I may that a popular revolution, backed
by the armj. Is tbe most likely thins In
the *if nation. The Jiipnnri'r army Is
\u25a0npreine In tbe empire. Military power
Jin* reduced tbe civil government. It
ban crowded out everything- elae. . That
fact ia po plain that nobody In Japan
will deny It.
"From the highest official down to the
private the army believes that It, and it
alone, has lifted Japan to the position of
a nrst-class power, with a seat in the
council of nations. It Is drunk with
power and with dreams of future
glory, it looks upon civil pursuits with
suepicion and contempt.
"The military leaders know that Japan
can take care of her financial burdens
without the aid of money from Russia.
But with a billion or a billion and a half
of Russian money they dreamed of a
Japanese , navy . that would make their
country the' first sea power In the worldâ
the Great Britain of Asia.
â¢Xo man who bait not been in Japan
within the laist few weeks can realize
tbe Iniininence of a revolution. Xo man
who bas not been in tbe field with the
army can have any Idea of horr near It
Is to the verse of revolt. The anti
foretsrn feeling- in tbe army in very deep
ned very bitter. ATow that the Emperor
bas waived a money Indemnity from
RuMMia and surrendered other thing;*
tvhiflt tbe Koldiery believed to be aw
\u25a0ured by their continued victories, It
will nimply be said that the foreign
ministry, aided by President Roosevelt,
bas wold out the empire.
"Ine Samurai blcod of the army is on
firfl. Nothing: elso counts in Japan to-day.
If' the army revolts I believe that Gen
eral Kodama, Oyama's chief of staff anÂ«l
the dominant intellect of the intensely
disaffected military caste, will be the
leader. He undoubtedly will have the
pupport of generals like Hasagawa and
Oku and that of Gote. the shrewd and
powerful Governor of Formosa. Oyama,
Kuroki and Ncdzu would at first prob
ably support the Emperor, but most of
the officers in the field would stand by
Kodama.
"It would not Hurprltie me if they
Khould Ignore the treaty of peace, defy
tbe Emperor and so riuKi on with the
war. viitli tbe idea that they mv com
pel RuinKia <<< yield what they demand.
I have not the KllkbtcKt doubt that tbe
people and the preMn, wbleb Is generally
antl-monarcbical, rather than Rotl-dy
nawtic, would flercely indorse such a
course." ... .

SETTLEMENT SOCIETY
STIRRED BY SCAXDAL
Charity Workers Among the

ii- Involved, v
Special Din>atch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â A university set
tlement society, conceived in the spirit of
philanthropy and charity by the wealth
iest and most powerful influences in this
city, is in the throes, of scandal.
Information from sources unimpeach
able â some of it from the head of the
society." I ' Professor "J. H. Hamiltonâindi
cates that several of the workers do not
cease their 'labors among the rookeries
and slums of the great East Side with
the coming of the twilight hour. Into the
night, sometimes long into the morning,
men who have taught the young by day,
spend their nights in cafes and dives.
Assistant Head Kellogg, '. a Harvard,
graduate, and assistant to J. G. Phelps
Stokes,^, is away on an enforced vacation.
He has been threatened by" the frienus
of his woman assistant, Miss Edna Mc-
Caughey, who,' enraged at his slander of
her, stek to do him bodily injury.
â¢ Miss McCaughey ; has herself been dis
missed and her mother," who taught a
class of. boys in : the settlement house on
Eldrldge " street without pay, has been
sent away. W. Patten Bethune, another
volunteer worker, has received a curt let
ter, of dismissal. * He accused Kellogg of
certain j shortcomings, t unbecoming a set
tlement" worker and a man. Although
another cause was assigned, as the reason
for his discharge, there seems little doubt
that his. verbal arraignment* of Assist
ant Kellogg for his treatment : of Miss
McCaughey inspired it.
Some of the '\u25a0> doings in the settlement
house -in Eldrldge street are almost In
credible. Wine is said to have been drunk

ONE DOLLAR PER" YEAiMEMBERS OF HOUSE
OF LORDS JEALOUS
OF THE BLACK ROD
CFFICIAL WHO HAS AROUSED
THE JEALOCST OF THE HOCSE
OF" LORDS.
Special DlrcÂ«icli to Tie C&IL
LONDON*.- Sept. 4.â That noble body
of hereditary legislators, the House of
Ixrrds, has become jealous of its most
auffust functionary, the gentleman
usher of the Black Rod. Its select com
r::'tee has recommended the appoipt
rient of a special committee to inquire
Into his "power to appoint and control
the doorkt-epers and messengers of this
h^use," and further to inquire "whether
U is legally competent for this house
to transfer such appointment and con
trol to any other person."*
T! 1 - present Black Rod is Admiral Sir
Hairy Stephenson. a hale and hearty
tar of â¬3 years and on the retired list;
For the sake of the pay that goes
with the billet â $10,000 a year â he has
cj;: sauted to play the rele of an exalted
f.unkty in knee breeches, silk stock
ings, silver-buckled shoes and a spiked
wai. He was appointed to the job only
a "y.-ar ago. ou the death of Sir ilartin
Bi'iÂ»lu2ph. Apparently he has given of
fense by cxercu-ins the patronage of
his office to supply some old messmates
vritli Km?Â£ jobs.
In American political life there is no
*"<.ir.ch" comparable with that enjoyed
by Black Red. In addition to his sal
ary, which exceeds that of a Cabinet
Minister at Washington, he is given,
ront free, a Sne suite of apartments In
thÂ«e Hous* of Lords. As the appoint
n:"?nt belongs to the crown, he is not
liable to be ousted by changes of ad
ministration. It ccrries irith it high
Â»<x-ia! privileges. The glory of being
chief gentleman usher to the. sovereign
a.i:<i usher to the Order of the Garter
far outshines the honor of chief door
keeper to the House of Lords.
BLACK ROD'S DUTIES.
Black Rod is required to attend on
the House of Lords only on state occa
sior.s. and the rest of the time he can
LiÂ« ke' life Just as easy as he pleases. No
ftody can dock his pay. His functions
ir* entirely ceremonial and no clerical
\u25a0rork is attached to the job. The name
sestoxv-ed upon him is derived from his
ftaff of oScÂ« â a short, ebony wand sur
nounted by a silver crown.

in the Captain's Behalf
WIFE WAS XOT DISCREET
Frequently With Men Who
Had \u25a0 Aroused the Sus
picions of Her Husband
Special EHsj^tch to The Call
WOOSTER. - Ohio, Sept. 4.â Major
Charles T. Kewberry of the United States
army, now retired and a banker in Pitts
bury. Pa., occupied the stand in the Tag
eart divorce case most of to-day. He
was the chiei\inspector of poHce In Ma
nila under Captain Taggart and roomed
at the Tasgart hcuse. He told of having
met Captain T&sgrart w-ith hs wife when
she joined him In ilanila, describing- it as
"a very happy meeting." Telling of Tag
gart's treatment of his wife, he said he
had. never heard the captain swear at
her, and never saw nor heard the cap
tain slap her. He s*id that he had heard
the captain reprimand her when Captain
Mitchell called at the house and was the
worse for liquor, saying that he did not
want officers who got drunk downtown to
come to his house and "sleep off their
jags."
Major JCewberry gave a description of
the Filipino woman, Augnstina. She was
middle-aged, very homely, smoked cigars
and chewed tobacco and went barefooted.
He never saw Taggart drunk in Ilanila
nor heard or his having been drunk, and
he believed that l^.-'-art could not have
been intoxicate^ without his knowledge.
He never knew of the captain having
been Intimate wltl. * ugustlna, and de
clared this to har~> b*. n impossible. He
and Captain Bash frequently went driv
ing with ilrs. Targart. He said Mrs.
Ta?rjrart was genei.lly r'easant to her
husband.
"I never saw her drunk or smoking
cigarettes," the major said. "I never saw
improprieties or Improper conduct on her
part, but thought she was Indiscreet in
going riding with men i with whom her
husband had forbidden Tier to associate."
Frank Gardiner told of "Billy" Tag
gart having flashed a roll of money, say
ins: Â«
"As long as I stand in with Grace. I
don't have to work."
Karl Ludwig said that "Billy" Taggart
showed him. a telegram from Grace and
said:
"Grace loves me; I love her. and I don't
give a damn who knows It."
It was the impression of those in the
courtroom after to-day's proceedings that
Taggart had scored pretty heavily upon
Mrs. Taggart. It is. believed that the ar^
guments will be begun to-morrow after
noon. ;>- _v-
GEOCEBS OF SEATTLE
TO KEEP UP PEICES
Merchants Accept Advice Of
fered bs; Prominent Cali
fornia Dealer.
EpÂ«cUJ* Vtes^teh to The Call.
SEATTLE, Sept. 4. â The' Washington
State Grocers' Association/ will be
urged at the meeting next week to de
mand of the manufacturers that prices
be maintained on staples. This action
will be urged by Lieutenant Governor
C E. Coon; who Is president of the as
sociation, and .' emphasized ~ Jby other
members and some prominent outside
speakers." It- has been pointed out by
M. Newberry," a prominent California
grocer and "one of the best known -men
in the business, that the remedy lies
entirely In the hands- of the manufac
turers and 'big producers. - This view
has been adopted -by the leading mem
bers of the State association and action
will be taken at the Tacoma meeting
nc-xt week to bring the manufacturers
Into line. -. \u25a0
who chances to be strolling around
must pay him thlÂ« much homage. But
when- he reaches the entrance to the

procedure Insists on retaining the
forma and traditions of earlier, differ

,one of the many picturesque archaic
survivals for which British .taxpayers
pay a big price* without a murmur. It
Illustrates some of the singular .* aaom
allea of the British Legislature that
the House of Lords, : which in the. ex
â¢ixrlse of Its legal rights has frequent
ly wrecked measures framed In .re-r
sponse-to the mandate of the nation,
should express a doubt whether It Is
-legally competent" to veto the petty
appointments of Its own chief door
keeper.
It Is highly probable that the ad
miral will win out In his fight with
the Lords, for he Is a great' favorite
of the King's and Is now his principal
naval aide-de-camp. . He .is" better de^
serving of a sinecure than most of the
titled folk; who generally obtain them.
He has been twice wrecked." has served
through. two wars and goodness knows
j how many "affairs." With "'the ; naval

In dispatches, especially for chis gal

ADAMS TO MEES
GEORGE JANES
Tennis Tournament on the
San Rafael Courts .Nar
rows Down to Two Cracks
The second day's' play of the coast
championship tennis tournament was pro
ductive of two surprises. They were the
defeat of Harold Braly, the Southern Cal
ifornia expert.and Reuben Hunt, the Ala
meda crack, who has made quite a name
for himself Jn the Eastr- Young Clarence
Griffin disposed of Bialy : in straight sets,
while George Janes did the same/or
Hunt. Braly has won most of the tourna
ments' in the'south this year and was ex
pected to be, the contender. In the first
set he had several chances to win; but his
diminutive opponent nosed hinyou't^ The
San 'Francissp boy completely! outplayed
Braty" irtÂ«thl fsecond -set; 'which he won
handily. Bral>;"s_ game, was away below
par, while his opponent never played bet
ter in his life." . ,_:
The defeat' of Hunt wa3 less of a sur
prise, as the game he played on Saturday
did not look good enough to carry' him
far. As was expected, he showed consid
erable improvement , yesterday, . but Janes
played a remarkably good game and took
the., Alamedan's/ measure , quite easily.
Hunt's defeat | is', partly due to the fact
that all his_ playing of late has been done
on grass courts. .". . ' . ."
The singles tournament was completed
down to the finals, the successful players
being Fred Adams of the \u25a0 Golden Gate.
Tennis Club and George Janes of the Cal
ifornia Tennis piub.; They will meet for
the championship on Saturday. \u0084 V.
The scrnl-rtnal matches were by far the
best of the tournament. In one thexon
testants were Adams an>i Griffin, and in
the other Carl Gardner and Janes. Even
after he defeated Braly many thought
Griffin would;. prove 'easy ; for : Adams.
Griffin, with , his usual self-confidence,
went right after- Adams, and the State
champion had his hands full. Adams won
the first set comfortably, and probably
let down a trifle early, in the second set.
Griffin kept -right.'; at. hiÂ« task, and before
Adams realized.- what had happened his
ciubmate had beaten him 0-1. In this set
Adams* was completely outplayed, none of
the- games being close.' ; \u25a0â¢\u25a0. .
, In the. third set both players seemed to
realize that much was at stake, and they
went to it â¢ hammer, and tongs. Adams
won the first, third and .fourth games,
giving him a lead of 3-1. Griffin won two
out of the next three games. The. eighth
game was - a long , deuce one and finally,
went to Adams, giving him a lead of 5-3.
Griffin kept his nerve and took the next
game. The tenth game went ? to Adams,
giving him the set and match.
ThQ match between Gardner *nd Janes
was productive of the longest set Qf . the
tournament. It was the opening; set and
was won by Janes by a -score of 13-11.'
Gardner was constantly in the lead upto
7-7. . when Janes : assumed it and | never
was headed.. It was anybody's set to the
very end and , some . r great tennis . waa
crowded. into it. Gardner led at 3-1 in the
second' act, but* Janes . again outflnished
him, ' Uking the next : five games straight.
In the first set Gardner led at 3-0. : {W- ": ?

THREE STANFORD STUDENTS

sophomore from Pasadena, and WJ W.
Adams and A. T. Josrelyn, freshmen

students, were taken into custody to-day |
because of their alleged connection with j
the supposed crime,' the evidence of. which j
was found on Alviso Slough yesterday.
After a thorough sweating by Chief of
Police Hill ar.d Deputy Sheriff Martin. \
they were released ; as they could not be
directly, connected with the supposed
crime. â¢ ' '\u25a0\u25a0'.'"
Launches dragged the slough all day,
but no body was found. From the facts
gathered to date and the evidence of the
students, It' \s believed the' owrier of the'
cloth.es found near, the slough bank com
mitted , suicide. ' The police .working on f
the 'case are of the opinion that the j
students know more than they revealed â¢
during .their hurried examination to-day
and they % will be watched while another
clew is being followed to-night. Enclna
| Hall was; Searched this afternoon for a J
student answering the' description given]
Marshall; Hill by David Mills, the boy j
who discovered the clothes. : Young Mills
was present at the. examination :of ths
students by the police to-day. He could
not. positively identify the two freshmen j
but was almost certain Sophomore Rust
was one of the visitors to the boathouse.
The. students claim they took their lunch
to the place forj a day's pleasure . and
that the clothe 3 were there when they
arrived. They admit, however, that they
destroyed- the boat and gun club prop
erty^ saying It was done ,in a spirit of
I mischief. ..Their contradictory statements
about \some ;of the details of" the day
make the searchers believe they can tell
more when questioned to-morrow morn-,
ing. ; . ',
The three boys claim they were not the
en!y: student visitors to the boathouse
Sunday. They say a ' number of other
pereons came on wheels, but they could;!
not give a description of any one. Deputy
Sheriff Martin will finish - his running j
down of a clew, jj in which j the hopes .of |
clearing the mystery are placed, to-night

BITTER LEGAL
FIGHT ON TAPIS
Residents -.of Eedwood City
Who Want Marsh Lands
Reclaimed Meet Opposition
WATEEWATS IXTOLYED
Proposition to Form a Ke
claination District in San
Mateo County to Be Fought
Epecial Dlscatea to Tie CalL
REDWOOD CITY. Sept. 4.â One of the
most interesting and hotly contested
legal battles in the history of the
county Is soon to be fought out before
the Board of. Supervisors. The Inter
ests Involved on both sides ara large
and the array of legal talent employed
by. the contestants is big enough for
a celebrated case. The question at
Issue is whether a reclamation district
shall be formed out of the valuable
marsh land lying east of this city.
In this land are * several sloughs
which are navigable to the bay. Their
value to the county and to property
owners in the proposed district is. of
course, very gTeat and opposition -. to>
any scheme that will involve the cut
ting off or damming of these sloughs is
organized . and determined. The people
who favor the plan to create a reclama
tion district have employed Attorneys
Hill and James T. O'Keefe. while those
opposed* to the proposition have the
combined talents of ex-Governor James
H. Budd. Judge Fitzpatxick. George C
Ross and District Attorney Bullock.
The Spring Valley Water Company,
the Phelps estate, the County of San
Mateo, C. R. Spltvalo and others 'own
ing* property in the proposed reclama
tion district or having interests ad
jacent to It. â¢ have united behiitd this
formidable legal battery and intend to
fight bitterly against any concession
being granted by the Supervisors. A
map of the proposed district shows
clearly that the projectors Intend to cut
off and dam the sloughs In question.
The "War Department at "Washington
ha" already waived all objection to the
prospective development upoa the
representation, it is claimed, that the
property owners are agreed to let tha
scheme progress. The Board of Su
pervisors has already commanded con
tractors to suspend work until the dis
puted points have been argued and a
conclusion satisfactory to everybody la
reached. The matter will be taken up
in detail -by the Supervisors at .their
first meeting In October.
The question is attracting consider
able public attention as the reclama
tion of thousands of acres of marsh
lands In this county is already uader
way and any interference with the gen
eral scheme of such immeasurable Im
provement to the county is viewed "wim
suspicion. On the other hand, no one
interested In the welfare of the county
will permit any of its navigable
streams to' be destroyed.

The confession made by Boodler Harry Bunkers to District Attorney Seymour* the main facts of wMch have been
obtained by The Call, is a remarkable document. It contains many startling disclosures, aiid places in the hands
of the Sacramento officials evidence that will cause a sensation when'it is presented to court. '

SACRAMENTO, Sept- 4^-Rumor. are
in the* air that disclosures of a sensa
tional character will be made in court
during the progress of the Eacona
trial. Inside gossip is to the effect that
Walter Parker, Abe Roef and Jere
Hcrke will be jolted, If the District At
torney shall be permitted to introduce
the Hunker* confession in full.
This does not signify that either one of
the three statesmen was directly or indi
rectly connected with the bocdling trans-f
action which caused the expulsion from
the Legislature of French. Emmons,
I3u niters and Wright, but it is said they
were close un to Bunkers in other legis
lative matters, and that Ruef in particu
:ar was under political obligations to
bunkers.
The confession o* Bunkers Is said to be
a most remarkable document. He was
with District Axtoraey 'Ssymour and a
stenographer for six. hours and gave up
the history of his political career from
the time that he entered the contest for
the Senatorship .in San. Francisco until
the hour that he entered the jail in Sac
ramento. When Bunkers In his dense way
began to reason In his own mind that his
confederates in guilt were enjoying free
dom under bail, while he was languishing
in prison and begging for opportunity to
split wood for physical exercise and moral
relaxation, he grew resentful.
Early in bis struggle to escape the
tneshe* of the lavr he was told that he
would be released on bail as noon as
the public clamor subsided.
The story goes that the District Attor
ney gave Bunkers to understand that a
bond in the sum of $10,000 would be accept
ed to guarantee his presence in court at
a stated time, but the politicians who
were counted on to rush around and get
the bail preferred to let the disgraced
Senator languish in the dungeon and split
wood for exercise rather than expose
themselves to the ugly comment which
they feared would follow any personal
activity to secure his release.
it is asserted Ulat Bunkers, on more
than one occasion prior to the making
of the confession, spoke of the ingrati
tude of Abe Rnef.
It is surmised that the confession will
clear ,aÂ«ray many conflicting statements
touching the methods cf handling the
bribe money and will deal in minute de
taii with a scheme which was concocted
ar.d subsequently abandoned to introduce
Joseph Jordan as an arch boodler who
had accepted th<^ money without the
knowledge of the four Senators.
The scheme of restitution provided
that Jordan should plunk down the
money on the table of the Investigat
ing committee and take all the blame
on himself. The game was abandoned
when it was ascertained that Jordan
would not pose as the boss culprit for
less than fZS.OOO.
At a time when it was supposed that he
would "stand in" steps were taken to cor
ral-all the floating boodle, and the con-

Wriieht will fisrnre as the Senator
who Â«aÂ« utterly shaken and demoral
ized nhen the exposure came. He had,
according to the story, $780 in green
backs-at that time and turned over the
whole amount to Emmons, the latter
promising to hold it in a safe place
until the storm blew over..
The incident that Wright had more than
twice $350 in $50 bills created the impres
sion that he was paid for himself and
some one else. -The storm did not lull as
Emmons predicted, so he steered his
course for shelter, depositing the money
In Hanlon's saloon safe through the
agency of the negro, Lee. About this
time Jimmy Copeland was engaged as a
lawyer and, with the aid of Lee, got the
money out of Hanlon's safe. The bills
were then placed in Mrs. Emmons' pos
session, but a count of the currency dis
closed a shortage of $750. There was a
hustling around of the boodlers and their
advisers to make up the round sum of
lliOO. Gold coin was contributed and ex
changed for bills of $50 denomination.
After the whole amount for restitution
was procured it was learned that Jordan
would not immolate himself to save the
gang. The story goes that the money
was then placed in the possession of ex-
Senator E. C. Seymour for safe' keeping.
SEYMOUR XOT TALKATIVE.
Surrounds the Bunkers Case With an
Air of Mystery-
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 4. â Public at
tention has been diverted for the time I
from Ex-Senator Harry Bunkers and
his confession to speculation as to the
probable reasons for District Attorney
Arthur M. Seymour's dramatic atti
tude in the entire affair. More than
any other case with which Seymour has
had to deal, the few years he has been
In public office, this case of the bood
ling State Senators is of general State
interest, and it j has been felt that if
any negotiations are going on to save
Bankers from his deserved fate of five
years in the penitentiary, the entire
public should be told frankly and fully
of the terms thereof, and the motives
that caused them to be entered upon.
Instead of this, while reputable news
papers have been refused information
on this subject, pool room owners, rac
ing touts and gamblers appear to have
been informed of the facts and have
caused them to be bandied about the
entire State.
"Harry Bunkers has confessed." was
the story which men of this character
have repeatedly told in the tenderloins
of various cities, and yet to all newspa
per Inquiries District Attorney Seymour

maintained that he knew nothing about
it. It was one of these reports, wired
from San Francisco, that led to the
publication of the fact that such con
fession had been made to the District
Attorney. Notwithstanding his denials
it is everywhere believed that the Dis
trict Attorney did obtain such state
ments from Bunkers, and the latter's
own words â¢to reporters who have
called on him bear out the belief.
As for PJunkers. he has won for him
self little local sympathy by the con
fession he has made. His attitude 1
during his trial was so contemptuous
a.Â« to make Judge Hart's sentence of
five years seem extremely mild. Sena
tor, French seemed crushed by the ac
cusation which he had to face^ Sena
tor Bunkers seemed to glory under his
stigma. Since it is known that what
ever he may have said to the District
Attorney has been prompted solely by
selfish considerations â the hope of es
caping the penitentiary and the desire
to revenge himself upon men who have
deserted himâ the spectacle of his
waiting to be called as State's evidence
against his associates [is not one cal
culated to gain him sympathy. In any
event, the public is impatient to know
what District, Attorney Seymour is do
ing. If anything, to " rescue* Bunkers
from the penitentiary.
It would seem ? thatin any. movement
looking to the \u25a0 pardon of : Bunk
ers the Governor would '. be con
sulted, \u25a0 since he Y is ; the y final
authority in the premises, but the Gov
ernor said to-day he had been Informed
of no such movement. He added;. in
answer to a question that if any appli
cation should, be presented in behalf of
a prisoner who promised to perform
any meritorious service for the State
he would give it due consideration.

CHICAGO. Sept. 4.â Nearly 20,000 yeltow
fever refugees., it ; is 'estimated,- are "in
Chicago sighing for the coming of frost
in the South and ffor; the lifting of the
quarantine. The j estimate is; made â¢by
hotel men, who are caring' for about 2000
of the Southerners.^ The rest are living
with friends or ' at \u25a0 private boarding
houses. Ever since the rever outbreak
they have been present, but the extent
of the army of visitors was not recog
nized until to-day, when a . department
store manager was figuring on his busi
ness for the last three months and found
how far it had' been enhanced by the
presence of the refugees. \u25a0-
At the stores the" fever refugees have
been easy to identify, for many of them
tied northward .without even -a sufficient
supply of clothing. ' Scores of them have
purchased entire outfits of clothing.
Some of the refugees had exciting and
amusing experiences on their way to the
North. Fiom the time < they left their,
homes until they passed the quarantine
zone they were .virtually \u25a0 prisoners in* the
coaches.-: Miss . Erna : - Samilllon* 1 of ;Kriox

SUPERVISION OF INSURANCE.
rpHE plight of the E*]uitabie and the more or less well grounded
1 suspicion that other great life companies are in the same fix have
* called attention to the need of.sterir supervision of those cor
porations. Heretofore when a man has been, solicited to take a life
policy in any company, if wise he has examined the insurance laws
of the Slate 'where the company is incorporated. This was a proper
precaution, but the Equitable disclosures have obsoleted it. The
leakage and waste of the capital of that company, which belonged to
its policy holders, went gayly on regardless of the supervisory laws
of the State of New York." Its policy holders are in every State
in the Union. They number 6co ? oco. "It is impossible for alh or a
majority of them, or a respectable minority of them, to know how
the company is heir.^-managed, or whether the insurance laws of
Xew York are being complied with.
The National Bar Association,' after examining the problem with
great care, recommends that Federal jurisdiction be taken over such
insurance companies. Their business is interstate. It is impossible
for policy holders, as individuals, to bring the, officers to book for
tnn\ c sressions; and it is unlikely that State Insurance Commissioners
will be wholly dutifal in the presence of; vast local interests, such
as appear to have, been Peking the juice out of the Equitable. 'A
larger and firmer jurisdiction is needed and can be supplied only,
by the Federal Government. Its exercise is properly government.
The Government: acts directly upon natural/persons in tlie exercise
of its functions and it should act directly upon artificial persons, the
corporations, which by doing an interstate business are obviously
within its constitutional iurisdiction. v
Insurance is one of the largest of human interests. Fire and
marine insurance have become necessary to the safe transaction of
the world's business. Life insurance is the most important safeguard
of society. It is a protection against indigence, a promoter of inde
pendence. As a cause of thrift it is even more important than the
savings banks. Their deposits may be drawn and dissipated in a
moment of recklessness. But if a man begin paying on a life in
surance policy he is more likely to keep it up. by sacrifice if need
be. and certainly by curbing his appetites<and economizing his per
sonal expenditures. He mayb e reckless with cash in hand, but is
sobered and steadied when the payment of an annual premium is
necessary to save what he has paid and keep his policy valid. It is
probable that there is no other influence upon men that exceeds life
insurance in imparting habits of thrift and economy.
It is a moral force also. It diverts to a legitimate channel
money that would otherwise be spent in folly, or. dissipation, or lost
in speculation. It takes part of the sting out of "death and brings
peace in the last hour with the knowledge that those to be left art:
provided for. The physical examination necessary to secure a'pbl
icv is a promoter of good habits and of good health. The man who
intends to make such provision for his family will abate his habits,
control his passions and order his life physically more according to
the laws of hygiene, in order that he njay be physically qualified to
be a policy holder. In every respect he will seek to reduce the moral
hazard to the point of acceptance as a risk. Moralists, political
econdnists and publicists have recognized these values in life in
surance. This being true, anything that destroys confidence in it. is
a blow at public morals.and the public health. But the history of
the Equitable proves that men who manage the companies are not
always able to resist the temptations of recklessness and greed.
Luxury and speculation make inroads upon their consciences and
their prudence, to the vast injury of society. _ .'V.,. ;
What subject is of more importance to government than this?
What other line of business is. so impingedupon the- morals, habits,
health, happiness and fortunes of the people ?. : /There is none. ..Federal
oversight and supervision will put insurance on the plane of; safety
and honesty. It will supplement the weaker hand of the States,
and will give the policy holder a confidence that cannot'eome from
any other source. -
' Xo more sorcery is required in framing such a law than Was
needed in drafting the interstate commerce Taw. A Federal Bureau
of Insurance belongs naturally in the Department of Commerce and
Labor. There the machinery is all ready to be adapted to this new
use. A Comptroller of Insurance is as easily provided as the Comp
troller of the Currency, in the Treasury Department, who has juris
diction of the national banks. Examiners of insurance are as easy
to find as bank examiners, and will be as faithful in the discharge of
their duties.. If Federal jurisdiction is not the solution of the in
surance pr6blem, what is? The National Bar Association, composed
of the best lawyers of the. country, is not .likely, to start a vain and
unnecessary movement. It has taken the initiative, and put the issue
before the country. The people and the press should do the. rest.
The millions of policy holders in the country should move together
in pushing the matter into and through Congress.
UNIVERSITY FARMS.
T ABORATORY v^ork in connection with theoretical instruction
j is one of the main points insisted. on in the August circular
"\u25a0â ' which the College of Agriculture of the University of California
is sending out with its experiment station reports. The present cir
cular is an extract from a lecture delivered by -Professor L. H:
Bailey, of Cornell University, at the summer session in Berkeley.
He was talking about present problems in agriculture, and the
part of his lecture which the college wishes to specially call atten
tion to is that in which he explains the purposes of a university
farm.
The professor states that about one-half of the agricultural col
leges of the Union are separate from the universities. Without dis
paraging these colleges he wishes to encourage the adoption of the
policy that the university idea should be a unifying idea in the
community, and that therefore the agricultural college.. work, should
not be separated from the university. The '\u25a0 -two \most \u25a0important
ways in which the university in recent times is gaining^ an influ
encing connection with, public affairs are the university extension
and the experiment station. 'The ideal of modern education is that
it should bear close relation to real life work, and to this endlabor-i
atory study is more insisted upon. This experimental work should
not lose the advantage of the guidance, assistance and co-operation
of such, other methods of knowledge as only a- great
can afford. As the lecturer states it: "All' laboratories' are peda
vgogically valuable in proportion' as they are in vital connection with
theoretical instruction." '
The point made by the lecturer from Cornell shows us the ad
vantage we have by our system of experiment station work in con
nection with the State University. It is work ! of ; that 1 kind that a
aniversity farm is mainly useful for. Such a farm should be in
nature of laboratory work and experiment regardless of' whether
the accounts of the farm . show ' a"! direct; profit" or not. It cannot be
made a model farm, nor a typical farm of the State. '. Such farms
are for practical farmers; but the university farm and experiment
gtations are to seek new knowledge and disseminate it with design
of increasing the future profits.of the practical farmers; and there
fore cannot count the costs and estimate the profits as in an ordinary
business.

UNLUCKY FRIDAY.

"Once upon a time I was. in a;, rail

two I have -ever experienced, and I
have traveled over 750,000 miles on
trains and steamers, three tlme3 as far

of me was an elderly lady who was
suffering from rheumatism. It - .was
necessary to change cars. I helped her
off the car, carried her vall3e, and gave
her the support of my arm: Behind us
came a noble looking- English lady
with her husband by. her side. \u0084
"She was scolding him well for Btart

you, James,' she said, 'something would
happen if we should start on Friday.'
"Madam," said I, "do you know that

TALL CORN STORY.
Stories of big corn are going the rounds
in the papers, and the Chula (Mo.). News
adds the following little mite: About' a
month ago Lv Harris, who ha 3 eierhty
acres of corn two mllc3 north, of Chula,
concluded he would go through It onca
more â¢with a : cultivator. He drove into
the field one morning and started down
the row. He had some difficulty in get
ting his mules near the field, .but iinally
succeeded in getting theni through tho
gate. But he found it impossible to keep
his mules in the field. After repeated ef
forts he drove home and funhitched. The
corn was growing co fast that the pop
ping sounded like artillery, and his mules,
never . having: . been in battle, would not
stand for the awful din. The noise of
the growing corn drowned the words of
command. with. .which Mr. .'Harris was
wont' to control . the^ wild - impetuosity of
his' hybrid steeds in* time' of peace, and
he-- has been ; ; compelled for the month
past; 1 and even ; up ]to this cay, to drive
out of 'his way to keep from passing the
noisy eighty. Our friend informed us
that the conditions . axe getting better,
because of the fact that the popping and
snapping is where the new ears ' shoot
that is, pretty well up the stalk, and al
ready the corn is so high that you can
only hear 'muffled r^pprts." He says that
by next ' week the corn \u25a0will be so high
that you will not hear It a: all except the
echo from { the Medicine Hills- at night
time. And thus it is that Missouri keeps
lip her fine" reputation for tall, splendid
corn.' .' . ' r'f.v*. ' \ , .

Chase is nominally wanted to answer

supposed to be en route to Honolulu

Jxt Van Dran at Portland, when :
Van Dran was shot in his saloon
en May 1 by Joe Young, a rival
taloon rpan. Chase was an eyewitness
to the shooting. Young's trial was s^t
for -to-morrow ajid the testimony of
Chase is essential to the prosecution. It
It alleged that influence was brought
to bear upon Chase to get him outside
the jurisdiction of the court before
Young's trial commenced.
Another mysterious event occurred
recently which the Portland police
think Chase can solve. Van Dran's
Trif* died from prussic acid poison on
the night of August 12, administered by
some unknown person.
Chase consented to talk in the prison
yt-sterday afternoon. He said: "What
hurts nÂ»e is the charge of-felony embez
zlement. I understand Van Dran ac
cuses me of embezzling $200. That is
false. I have lived in Portland for
nearly twenty-three years and I defy
any one to say that I ever wronged him
of a cent. lam no embezzler, and it is
just a trumped up charge to get me
back. Why. for a month after Van
Dran was shot I had full charge of his
saloon and it raid better under my
management than ever before. Before
I left Portland Van Dran gave me 53,
and a few days before that he gave me
"I don't see why they are so anxious
to gret my testimony. There were four
others present in the saloon when the
6hooting took place and their testimony
would be as strong: as mine. The case
has been monkeyed with till I grot tired.
I had already given my testimony four
times. I suppose I made a mistake in
leaving, but it Is not true that any In
fluence was brought to bear upon me
to leave. I took the steamer Spokane
at Portland. It was advertised to sail
at 8 o'clock et night, but the hour was
postponed^ti ll 1 next morning, and my;

' CHIEF. TALKS OF CASE.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. 4.^ â Fremont
R. Chase is charged with embezzling
property and money aggregating $108
from Kd'speV, Van Drati, for whom he
tended bar, but the other reasons for
his arrest arc that he Is an Important
witness ag-ainst Joseph Young, the sa
loon-keeper, who shot and almost
killed -Van Dran, and that the authori
ties are satisfied that If Chase is not
guilty of Mrs. Van Dran's murder he
was at least an accomplice m the crime.
Kaspor Van Dran was shot by Joe
Young about 12:30 p. m., August 1. At
that time Chase was acting as night
bartender and continued as such while
Van Dran lay ill at the hospital.
Mrs. Minnie B. Van Dran, wife of
Kasper Van Dran, drank part of a
glass of ginger ale at her home, 33
North Seventeenth street, at 10 o'clock
on the night of August 12, and died in
a few minutes, after warning her sister
not to drink from the same bottle. An
analysis of the contents of tho bottle
showed that enough potassium cyanide
had been put in the beverage to kill a
score of people.
"There are several things connected
with the departure of Chase, and con
cerning : his recent' actions, that are
very peculiar," said Chief of Police
Gritzmacher. '"Of course we are not
prepared just now to say what if any,
part he had in the murder of Mrs. Van
Dran, but we Intend to use every means
within our power to ascertain before
before we finish with this case. Im
portant developments are looked for
when the trial of Joe Young for hia at
tempt upon the life of Kasper Van
Dran takes place. We have learned
that Chase . worked in a* drug: store in
the East, that he is familiar with' drugs
and that he has for some time been ex
perimenting' with drugs -in his living
apartments. .
THIXKS KBfXEY KNOWS.
"I cannot tell what connection, if
any, Kinney and the woman had with
the case." I am now inclined to believe
that Kinney, who is a warm friend of
Chase, knows much concerning the
crime. I am anxious to secure the re
turn of the entire quartet and this
will be done, if sufficient facts are as
certained by Detective Vaughn and his
assistant when they have had talks
with the prisoner.
"One of the most Important things
learned by Detective Vaughn is that
Chase, who recently took a vacation,
returned the afternoon ". preceding the
evening that Mrs. Van Dran drank thfl
poison. The supposition is that the cy
anide of potassium was iplaced in the
bottle of ginger ale. during the absence
of Van Dran. his wife and sister-in
law, Miss Monteith. -.And the thing
that makes It look bad for Chase and
Kinney is the fact that they went
aboard the Spokane and gave fictitious
nam.es. Chase called himself Ray Fre
mont and Kinney; signed as a brother.
This Is a procedure not usually fol
lowed "by innocent persons."

WANTS COIM IN HAND
BEFORE THE FIGHT.
Big Feliow Names His Own Figure and
Will Not Accept One Cent Less
Jimmy Britt Considering Demand While
Dane's Manager Insists on Siler.
Jim Jeffries dealt the principals of the
great fight at Colma a solar plexus blow
last night when he came out openly and
refused to accept a thousand dollars as
compensation for refereeing the fight, de
claring that if they wanted him yery
badly they would have to come through
with Just twice that amount. When Jeff
â¢ays a thing he always means it, so now.
If he does not get his price, the lighters
will have to agree upon another referee.
When Manager Jim Coff roth heard the
news last night he only smiled one of
those .knowing smiles of his, for he has
had dealings with the big fellow in days
gone by and knows what time it is. When
the news was broken to Jimmy Britt he
tossed both mitts up in the air and was
about to collapse. Brother Willis took his
cigar out of hie face ana winked. Then
Jimmy recovered and said he would con
alder the offer.
When eeen late last night, Billy
Nolan. Nelson's manager, said he con
sidered Jeffries out of the question now
and demanded that George Siler of Chi
cago be named to referee the fight.'
Nolan added that the referee was to be
on the ground five days before the bat
tle and as Jeff had not appeared he
would not be considered. The Britts
will surely balk at this and a hot ses
sion Is expected to-day.
Following 1s an interview with the big
fellow In Los Angeles last night:
"I shall not accept Promoter Coffroth's
offer. He can get me for $2000 and not
one penny less. If they want me that
much worth, I guess they can have me.
It is too much of a chance to get the
worst of it, and no cnance to make
good except on what you see in your
hand before the fight."
This seems rather decisive, especially
when It comes from a man like Jeff.
Why he did not come out and say these
things several days ago no one seems to
know, but he has had his say now. and
there is nothing left for the principals to
do but to go ahead and take him at his
figure, or else get together once again
ar.d name another man.
If this is done it will surely make the
fight look bad. Jeff has been chosen, and
in the eyes of the sporting public a paltry
thousand dollars should not stand in the
way of the principals in accepting him.
But they are all sure to make an awful
holler and try and stall as best they can,
for every thousand counts, even with a
boxer.
Manager Coffroth Is not worrying over
the affair, for it is not up to him to pay
the price. The fighters must compensate
the referee out of their share of the gate
receipts, and the manager has nothing to
cas' in the matter, so he has passed it up.
It is very likely that Willis Britt and
Billy Solan will come together In a ses
sion before the pun is many high
to-day. The battle is now but four days
off. and if they are going to have Jeff
referee it they will have to get busy and
decide In a hurry. If the big fellow gets
his price it will surely be tne highest fee
ever paid a referee In the history of the
ring. But Jeff is worth it, and besides he
does not need t&Q money. He can afford
to be Independent.
In the meantime. Manager Coffroth Is
going right ahead with the work on the
pavilion. Everything Is getting .along
nicely, and the place can be gotten ready
ie a day's notice If necessary. _' Work was
rushed along yesterday, and so far every
thing Is satisfactory.
The sale of seats goes merrily on, and
so far It Is the biggest advance ever
known here, though no one but the man
agement knows what the exact figures
ere. However, they must mount up to a
king's ransom, for the house Is about sold
out at the present time, only a few of the
higher-priced seats being on the list of
uncalled for.
Britt continues to rule a 10 to 7 choice
over the. Dane. There was little or no
betting yesterday, but It Is expected that
the; anxious ones will commence to come
through with their money to-day. .Harry
Corbett looks to see the bulk of the wag
ering come off to-morrow, and If things
keep on as they have been going for the
last few days the price will surely drop
till Britt enters the ring a 2 to 1 favorite
over the battling one from Chicago.

PURE BLOOD

ance it ja a sore sign that the blood is
filled with humors and burning acids.
These being forced through the pores
tad glands ourn and blister the ekin, pro-
ducing the eruptions which are usually
accompanied with intense itching, and
are disfiguring and humiliating.
Tears avo sny blood was bad. as evi-
denced by akin eruptions on different
parts of the body, and other symptoms,
so I concluded to try S. 8. S., knowinu it
to be highly spoken of. After using a
number of bottles â do not remember now
Just how muchâ my blood was thor-
oughly purified and enriched and I was
relieved of all eruptions and manifesta-
tions of impure blood. I believe S. S. 8.
to be an excellent blood medicine, and
any one in need ol such a medicine
would do well to use it. They will find
it a perfect cure as it-proved to be in my

THE SWIFT SPECIFIC CO.. AOanta. 6a.
JIM JEFFRIES' PRICE IS $2000
eng'ag-enient with Britt. It must be ad
mitted that Nelson is a much improved
man to what he was on the day he left
Larkspur- to pitch his tent near the
Colma battling ground.' His face has
lost the sunken appearance it had last
Wednesday, his eyes look clear and in
fact the Battling one looks as hard as
nails. Manager Xolan himself ac
knowledges that his man was not as flt
as he should have been ..when he came
over to this side, but ascribed his lack
of condition at that time to the enerv
ating: influence of the heat in Larkspur.
Xolan says the Dane has never gone
below . 135} i j?ounds since he has been
In training. Nelson himself stated that
he weighed \u25a0 13jiÂ£ nounds on Sunday,
so the taking the off the extra two and
a half pounds will be almost as easy as
rolling off a log. â¢
There was a fair sprinkling of the
fair sex when Nelson began his after
noon work in the open air. Nelson first
took on RoyStqne, more for the -warm
ing up process than, anything else. Af
ter two Tounds< of tame going, during
which Nelson drew the claret from
Stone's nose, the latter appeared highly
pleased when time was called. Then
Nelson took on Bob Lundie for two
rounds, which were somewhat of an im
provement over the first bout. The
real work began , when Nelson and Lan
ders mixed things up for three rattling
rounds, during which it was give and
take, the advantage being with neither
man. The tactics that prevailed when
Britt and Nelson clashed before, were
repeated. Landers holding on and Nel
son trying to reach with left or right to
Landers" wind. There was much but
ting and wrestling in the rounds, be
sides hitting in the getaway, where
Landers proved more proficient than
his opponent. When the bout was end
ed Tenders remarked that Britt would
not be likely, to hold' on for forty-five
rounds. After punching the bag and
playing a game of handball the Dane
got the usual rub down.
Eddie Graney was an interested ob
server of Nelson's work and at its con
clusion remarked that the Bane, was
just as awkward as ever.
BRITT GETTING TO WEIGHT.
From now on the objective point of
Jimmy Britt'e training will be to grad
ually drop . down ' to 133 pounds, the
weight at which he will meet Battling
Nelson at Colma next Saturday. â¢As the
local boy's weight is at present about
136, this will not be a severe task.
The gym connected with Sheehan's
Villa on the ocean beach was filled to
overflowing again yesterday, among the
more notable of those present being Abe
Ruef, Police Commissioner Poheim, Sena
tor Shortridge of San Jose, John L. Her
get (Young Mitchell) and Billy Jordan,
the veteran announcer. Owing to the cool
climatic conditions existing Jimmy and
his trainers scratched road work and surf
bathing: from the programme. . ,
Britt began with a long stretch of rope
skipping, finishing up with no apparent
effect on his breathing apparatus or sea
soned underpinning. Johnny Frayne of the
Olympic Club and Jimmy then went four
rounds with the gloves, which were re
plete with stiff punching and all-around
clever work. Danny Danziger, another
Olympian, followed in a three-round bout.
Danny was inclined to mix it freely, and

Again ; yesterday the Seals and the Si
washes shared victory and defeat, the
Seals coming through in the morning
game at Oakland and the Siwashes com
ing back in the afternoon struggle at the
Eighth street lot. Both games were char
acterized by the liberal wielding of the
clifb, co runs were always plentiful.
The Siwashes began to office up to the
benders cf Jimmy Whalen from the mo
ment the first ball -rras pitched. They
bingled in two runs in a trice, giving
them a nice little lead to start off with.
But when the. Seals came right back with
three In their half of the round it made
the ; fans hopeful, , for there seemed a
chance for the natives to sustain the
pace, which they did not do, however.
But the Siwashes were out for victory,
and they never overlooked any bets at
that. They made it a tie score by send
ing another one over in the second, and
jumped into the lead in the fourth by
swelling their total to five. After that
the game was in. "Whalen was chased to
the bench and Henley came forward to
subuue the Siwashes, but he did not have
a thing the northern tossers could not
wallop. ' ;', .
Bennett, the new Siwash second base
man, late of Louisville, made his bow
to the local fans in the morning game.
He was there with a two-bagger, besides
playing a nice game at the keystone sack.
In the afternoon Bennett bit off a double
and a single, stole a base and" ate up
everything that came near him. He is a
little fellow, bats left-handed and runs
like a deer. From first impressions Ben
nett looks like the goods.
Joe Nealon swung on a fast one in the
eighth inning, and away it went over the
center field fence. John Taylor of Boston
was in the house at the time, and this hit
probably made Joe look even better " to
the Hub City magnate.
There will be. no games to-day or to
morrow. On Thursday Oakland and Los
Angeles, , the two leaders, will open up
here. The score:

J. McTigue and Tom Cab :
ney Both- Take Tumbles,
but Neither Is Injured
"Dexter Wilkes furnished the princi
pal sensation, at" the races of the San
Francisco' Driving Club â¢at Ingleside
.track yesterday, and it was an after
noon rather full of excitement. The
spirited animal decided .'.-\u25a0 while the
horses were getting ready for â¢ the
start in the. second heat of the 2:45
.class race that it would rather be in the
paddock, and jumping the rail, started
on , a run for it. ; Efforts to' stop -the
animal frightened It worse and it ran
through the paddock entrance, leaving
the sulky hanging there, the gatekeep
er jumping out of the way just in time.
With what little harness it had on fly
ing about in the air, the horse flew into
the space occupied by the betting ring,
most of the crowd of men making, for
the stairways, It being thought that the
animal still drew, the sulky. 'It was
surrounded and captured. -;' .-, ...'\u25a0\u25a0'
\ When the excited horse first tried tÂ©
jump the fence, women in the i grand
stand screamed, thinking Charleyi.Fulk
erson, its driver, would be killed, Â» but
heescaped unhurt. He drove the horae
in the, heat.
In the first heat of the same race Joe
Me came past the judges' stand first, on
a dead 'run and driverless, Joseph' Mc-
Tlgue, its owner and driver, having
been thrown "from his sulky by the
horse running- into Dexter . Wilkes,
which suddenly, swerved on the turn.
McTlgue lomped back to the judges'
stand, having escaped practically unin
jured.' Joe Me took the next two hestts
of the race, though Ed Ray, who won
the first, ' gave j hlma close rub for the
third in an exciting finish. Best time,
2:31^.
After the first heat of the 2:25 race,
which was won\by Cadenza, E. Cerciat
driver, Tom Cabney, behind Lady Jef
fries, made an ; angry protest to the
judges, claiming that . Cerciat had
crossed him on the stretch. In the sec
ond heat of this race the mare went
down' in a collision with King Cadenza
in the first quarter. Cabney and the
animal Avere unhurt.. Cerciat com
plained to the Judges that Cabney had
deliberately run into" him, and Cabney
said that Cerciat had again attempted
to cross : him. The judges gave no de
cision in the matter and Cerciat angri
ly declared that he would resign from
the association. ,f
â¢ The owner of Kitty f) was fined $20
because the mare's rider delayed
start in the first heat of the free-for-all.
The first rafce, 2:35 class, was all be

the second.heat at 6 to 5, Alden selling
in the first heat at 3 to 5. r \u25a0
Cloenthus won the five-eighths run
ning at 3 to i 1 in .1:03^. The three
quarters running was won |by \ Sherry
at 6tol in 1:18. This horse had failed
to show In the "first running event. Its
owner bet $90 ,on Its chances in- the
first and kept off him in % : the second
sprint.
Kitty. D won- 1 the. free-for-all In

ry Hurst, at 5 to 1, gave her, a close
rub in the first heat. Grace McKenny

Mrs. Sands Blames Husband
WOMAN" WHO IS HEARTBROKEN BECAUSE HER HUSBAND HAS SPIRITED
HER BABES AWAY. SHE ASSERTS THAT HIS CHARGES THAT SHE HAD
ABA.VDOXED THEIR HOME AXD THE CHILDREN ARE UNTRUE.
Out In her bare home at 804 McAllister
Ftxeet a lone woman Is crying and pray
ing for the speedy return of her two ba
bies. Somewhere, either in a hiding-place
in San Francisco or on board an east
bound flyer, these two little tots are sob
bing their hearts out for soothing ca
resses from "mamma." Every now and
then the mother ceases her weeping and
prays fervently for strength to bear her
through her trouble, while 10 her friends
the pours forth a pitiful tale of cruel de
certion and deceit on the part of her
bttsb&sd.
This unhappy mother Is Mrs. Ina Sands.
*ife of the man who took the two babies
tt- police headquarters on Sunday after
noon and there said that hi.s helpmeet
had left him with the little ones on hi 3
hands He is E. S. Sands, and last night
he came to The Call offlce to state that
he was leaving for the Kast with the
children and to ask that his wife be
'"roasted", for her actions. He said that
he would gr> to his aged uncle and aunt,
Kear Admiral Sands and wife, who,, he
alleges, reside in Cincinnati, Ohio.
THe story of the -wife is far different
from that the husband has told. She
j-ays that she ts the person who has been
cruelly treateo and left to live as best
she could. "He left me on last Friday."
Fhe said yesterday, "after threatening to
kill me many times. On Sunday I re
ceived a telephone message from himâ
the rent was due that dayâ and he told
me to meet him at Hayes and Octavia
ttreetF and he would pay me the money.
I left the two children in the house and
went to see him. He was not there, nor
did he appear during the three hours that
I waited there for him.
"When I came back home the children
were gone, and my neighbor told me that
my husband had come and taken them
away. I ran? up the police and they
told me that he had come and gone, and
\ hat the babies were gone. I did not
know what to doâ l do not know now. I
do not know where he is. nor what he
has done with our little ones. I have
cried and prayed and asked help from
the police, but I have not neard from Mr.
Sands. He left me with 35 cents and the
rrnt to pay. I have been here since Sun- 1
<i*y. His story that I deserted the chll- I
rfrÂ«*n !* not true. He duped me, so that
he could get away with them." ,
Mre. Sands Â«&yn that gambling has been |
the ruin of her husband, and turned him |
from a pood man , into an evil demon.
"Our early married life was a iiappy '
one," ehe said, "and until he began to I
gamble we irot along well together. He '
made good wages and was saving his I
money. Then came the gambling and the '
staying away from home. ;
"He has cent me home to my mother
twice, and once I supported myself and
tne little ones for nearly a year. He was
arrested twiceâ once for larceny and once
tar torg^ryâuvit he was acquitted both
times. We have lived in â¢ many differ
ent places under many diff/rent names.
From races my husband drifted to cards.
We would stay in one town until people
lost confidence in him, and then move to
another. That is what caused all the
trouble between us."
The story of Mrs. Sands Is supported
hy her neighbor. Mrs. Hay. who Is help-
Ing Lhe young: woman In her trouble. Mrs.
Sar.ds says that Â«he will go to work here
In San Francisco. She does not think ;
that her husband had money enougrh to j
po East. In the meantime the heart- j
broken woman is looking anxiously for
the return of the' little ones.

LAY DOWN LIVES
TO SAVE OTHERS
Captain and Six of Sevona ? s
Crew Die Heroes' Deaths
in 1 a Lake Superior Storni
WOIIEX EEACH THE LAND
Sunivors Send TugXto the
Wreck, but No Ti-ace Is
Found of Gallant Seven
BAYFIEL.D, Wls., Sept. 4.â Eleven of
the crew of the steamer . Sevona were,
drowned when the steel steamship was
wrecked on Sand Island Reef in Lake
Superior late Friday night. Eleven others
were rescued, including the remainder
of the crew and four women.
The story of the Gisaster is as thriving
a tale of shipwreck on the . Great Lakes
as' has ever been told. Seven of, the dead
offered their lives as a sacrifice for : the
rest of the twenty-two on board the ill
fated ship. Of those'for whom they gave
their lives four are dead. The rest reach
ed shore after a night of buffeting by the
waves in an open boat. ~ -
Those who save their lives for their
shipmates were: Captain E. S. McDonald,
Northeast, Pennsylvania; First Mate
Lewis Darwin. Medina. Ohio; second
mate, name ur -own, shipped at Cleve
land on lasc trip; wheelman, name un
known, shipped at Cleveland on last trip;
two watchmen, names unknown, shipped
at' Cleveland on last trip; wheelman,
name unknown, has brother named
Denny at Buffalo drydock, shipped at
Cleveland.' / " "
Those who were probably drowned . In
the effort to reach shore were:
Fireman, ; name unknown, shipped at
Cleveland on August 23; â â ' Van Vleek,
oiler, Erie, Pa.; oiler, name unknown,
shipped at Cleveland on last trip; deck
hand, name unknown, from . North
east, Pa.
The Sevona, a big ten-hatch vessel, was
bound from \Allouez to Erie with ore.
Four women were on board, including
the wife of the cook, C. H. Clucky. The
others were aboard as guests of the
owners and were: Mrs. S. F. Spencer,
Miss Jones of Erie, and Mis. William
Phillips of Buffalo. - '
Friday the steamer ran into the teeth
of the northeaster and was wrecked on
Sand Island Reef while running for
shelter.
When the captain found that there was
no chance for all to try and reach shore,
he called for volunteers to stay on the
ship. More than half the crew volun
teered. Finally the captain, the two
mates and four others, sailors, who were
under no obligation to stand by a sink
ing ship, were selected to risk their lives
for the safety of the rest.
Engineer Phillippi was one of the vol
unteers, but Captain McDonald refused
to allow him to remain on board, order
ing him to take command of the ship's
bouts which were to take the women
ashore.
Saturday morning the storm-tossed
party was washed ashore at Little Sand
Bay. Here they found a homesteader,
who led them to a farm two miles in the
interior. The men were so exhausted
they could hardly walk.
Then, while the rest of the party was
cared for at the farm, the engineer and
one of the farmers set out with a team
for Bayneld, where the fishing tug Har
row or the Booth line started out for the
scene of the wreck with a party of fif
teen men, headed by Engineer Phillippi.
The trip took two hours in" the tetjth of
the northeaster. â¢ .
When the tug reached the scene of the
wieck only a few spars' and the after
one' hundred feet of the Sevona were left.
There was no trace of th< . captain nor of
the four in the small boat, and they are
unduubtedly lost. .
SHIPPING SUFFERS HEAVILY.
Many l.lrm and Much Property Lost In
Lake Superior Storm.
DULUTH, \u25a0 Sept. 4. â Eighteen or
twenty lives were lost und property
valued at half a million dollars sacri
ficed in the furious storm that swept
over Lake Superior Sunday and Sun
day night. The gale was the most de
structive to lake shipping that has been
experienced in many. years. Besides the
wreck of the steel steamer, ijevonu, the
schooner Pretoria, of B;iy City. Mich./
was sunk oft Outer Island and five of,
her crew drowned. She -was the larg
est Bailing 1 ship on fresh water, and
carried a crew of eight men. The
schooner Olive Jeanette." which carried
a crew of seven men, is . also thought
to have . gone* ' down. The Pretoria
broke loose from the steamer that was
towing her during the storm. The
Olive Jeanette. it is believed, went to
the bottom about ten miles from Por
tage entry. A mass of wreckage was
sighted by the steamer- Juanlta near
that point,' and although the identity
of the ship has not been completely es
tablished, there seems little doubt that
it was the Olive Jeanette. This schoo
ner was in tow of the steamer L. R.
Doty, when^the latter/ vessel- was lost
with her entire 1 crew on Lake Michi
gan a few years ago.
The storm at times reached the pro
portions of a hurricane and the
stanchest new steel vessels were
forced to run for shelter in more or
.less battered condition. ' The new steel
steamer Stackhouse arrived. at the Soo
on her first trip with her hatch ; covers
so badly sprung that water, poured con
tinuously into the hold. One of the
crew was washed overboard. The
whaleback steamer. Simuel . Mather,
also lost one of her : crew overboard.
The ttrrlftc battering the : steel steam-r
ers received in the storm, gives rise to
the gravest fears tor . the, safety, fof
many, wooden, ships, which . have ; not
yet reported, arid the record, of dearth
and destruction may ; reach . much'
greater proportions*- than .the present
estimates. The monetary loss of, the
Sevona Is placed at $170,000, while that
of the Pretoria is estimated at $150,000.
, FIVE OF CREW DHOWXED.
DULUTH; Minn., Sept. 4.â lt was defin
itely learned here to r nlgnt;. that the
sunken schooner near Outer Isiand; Is i; the
Pretoria.". Five of : her. crew of ten were
drowned; by the capsizing of the 'yawl in

TO BE PLAYED
popi;lar captain of the ekg
â¢ lish football team, which
WILL PLAY HERE. \u25a0 .
Special Dispatch to The Call:
LONDON, Sept. 4.â Sir Charles Sharpe
Kirkpatrick iwill act as captain of the
English football team which is going
to. play a series of interesting maitnfs
in Canada and the United States. He
is a big- fellow, with a genial smile and
puts a terrible amount of weight into
the ball every time his foot comes in
contact with it. He is a versatile player,
who earned high honors at the game,
and is good ai almost everything in the
way fo athletics. The ancestral prop
erty is situated in Dumfriesshire, Scot
land, but the old mansion of Closeburn,
built by the tirst Baronetâ the creation
dates J trom 165Sâ was burned through
the carelessness of drunken servants in
174S and never rebuilt. Sir Charles re
sides at Forest Hill, in London. Ke is
31 years old ajid represents the main
line of the family, to which the Em
press Eugenic belongs; Lady Kirkpat
rick, who will accompany her husband,
is well known in English society and
w.*i undoubtedly make many friends on
the trip.
The team has taken the appropriate
name' of the "Pilgrims," a name that
wias famous in the early days of associ
ation football in England thirty years
ngo, and the revival of the title has
given much pleasure to a large number
of enthusiasts in this "country. The
chief object of the visit is to popu
larize the English style of . game, in
which kicking is the chief feature, and
running with the ball; is entirely bar
red. Among the "Pilgrims" will be in
cluded some of the best, players in the
country. Fred.Milnes plays regularly
for the league team of Shelfieldâ a club
that has won the championship more
than onceâ and one : of the finest full
backs in the country. Milnes is in busi
ness with his father as an iron founder
at Owleston, near Sheffield. He is a
fair-haired young fellow of splendid
physique, and BOjfond is ho of the game
that he' has been known, to play six
strenuous matches in as 7 many days. }
-The star player of : the" team Is un
doubtedly Vivian J.- Woodward of/ the
Tottenham Hotspur > Club, London.
Woodward is by far and away the best
center forward in England at the pres
ent time; indeed, it is doubtful If there
has ever been a better. : Woodward is
a very graceful and. yet a very, tricky
player. HÂ« has had all the highest
honors bestowed upon him by hia coun
try. He has played njjalnst Scotland.
Ireland and Wales and has only once
been on the losing side. Woodward is a
Londoner, and by business he is an
architect.
J. D. Barnadale (Notts Forest) and R.
E. HounÂ«ne!d (Derby County) are also
players of the very first class. They rcg*
u'.arly appear In first league football
every week during the season, anil, bar
accidents, .-they are bound in the course
of time to get their international taps.
R. -H. HounsflUd Is one of the swiftest
forwa*ls playing in ths game In Eng
land, and his electric rushes are always
calculated' to rouse the enthusiasm ofthe
spectators.- He is quite a youth, and he!
Is said to have ; more, money than he
knows what to do with. . \u25a0\u25a0 .. . ,
' C. W. Storey comes of a family well
known in Liverpool commercial circles.
Besides being a "Pilgrim," he is a "Co

CHURCH BUILT
IN SINGLE DAY
Congregation Does the Work
ancT Prayer Service Is Held
-in the .Edifice at Night
EVERY SHINGLE PLACED
Women Encourage the Men
With Refreshments and
Carry Nails anil Hammers
KANSAS CITY, Sept. 4.â The"memberÂ»
of /the / Afniourdale Baptist Church built
a church to-day, and held prayer" service
in it this evening at 7 o'clock. The new
churchy is at Tenth street and Euclid ave
nue, in Kansas ; City, Kans. It was con
structed entirely by the members of the
church. Last week -the .materials were
hauled to the' ground, and early this
morning al! of the able-bodied male mem
bers -of the congregation . began work.
"Uncle" Steve Allen. 74 years old, was
placed at the head of the workers. When
"Uncle" Steve said "nail," everybody
nailed, and the little church' seemed to
rise out of the ground.
The church is 24 by 40 feet in dimensions
and will seat 200 persons. The . building
was shingled and ready for use at 6
o'clock this evening.
"This church -will .be known as -tHe
Split-Log Baptist Mission Chapel." said
Mr. Streeter as. he stopped for a fevs- mo
ments to rest. He had been sawing.
"Yes, indeed," he continued, "this is a
novel as well as an economical way . of
building a church. -This is the second
church, we have built this way." â¢
Then the pastor resumed sawing, signi
fying that the interview was at an end.
Three years ago to-day the same con
gregation built a similar church. When
the big flood came the little house of
worship was wrecked.
The women of the church gave dinner

NEW THEATRICAL
SEASON OPENS
Five New Plays by Favorite
Dramatists Are Presented
in the New York Theaters
A BRILLIANT BEGINNING
Maxine Elliott; Wins a Warm
Welcome for / Great
Match," by Clyde Fitch
NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â With five new
plays . written ,by : favorite dramatists or
HbrettlstsVand presented tÂ»-nlgrht to
the public for the first time by some of
America's leading: actors, and with the
addition of several other, notable at
tractions, which to-night made their
initialappearance in this city, the 1905
1906 theatrical season - had a brilliant
beginning-. "Three society comedies and
two musical comedies were the new of
ferings.. \u25a0-, ! \u25a0 -, ': .-\u25a0 ;',\^ ;-.:, \u25a0' ':':\u25a0_
Clyde; Fitch's new play, "^er Great
Match," with Maxine Elliott in .the
leading: role, j was given Ea ; warm wel
come at the,. Criterion ..Theater. The
plot, j which " was woven about the ob
stacles preventing a German â¢ .Crown
Prince from marrying: an American
girl." had its solution in the Prince's re
nunciation of his throne. Miss Elliott
is supported by a strong company. |
John Drew introduced an Augustus
Thomas comedy,' called "De Lanoby,". at
the Empire Theater. Supporting . him
was Margaret Dale. The scenes of "De
Lancey" were, laid .about New York,
giving Mr. Drew an. opportunity in. the
character of a society man in love 'with
a girl, 1 whose fiance, unknown to him
self loved another young woman. This
situation, De Lancey, as impersonated
by Drew, had to solve by simultaneous
ly winning his own wife while making
a match for another man.
Making her first metropolitan ap
pearance in the title role of "Miss Dolly
Dollars," at the Knickerbocker Theater,
Miss Lula Glaser to-night stepped from
the realm of romantic opera into Amer
ican musical comedy, the transition be
ing witnessed by an audience which
filled the playhouse. '
The production of Hall Cain e's play,
"The Prodigal Son," at the New Am
sterdam, was new to New York, al
though already seen in Washington. "It
was furthermore a distinct contrast
from the other opening, having its
Icelandic setting and scenery and an
undoing in which a man sacrificed his
happiness.
"The Prince Chap," a new comedy by
Edward Peple, was submitted .to a
first-night audience at the, Madison
Square Theater. An odd feature was
that three players were required to
impersonate the heroine during the
course of the play, showing her at the
respective ages of 5. 8 and 18.
In addition to the openings to-night
both Tuesday and Wednesday will con
tinue . the first-night . presentations,
Tuesday with George Bernhard Shaw's
new comedy, "Men and Superman,'.' and
Wednesday with Nat C. Goodwin in
"Beauty and the Barge," a comedy by
W. W. Jacobs and Louis N. 'Parker. "
LITTLE GIRL
FOULY SLAIN
Mutilated Body of Two- Year-
Old Is Found on Stairway
of New York Tenement
NEW YORK, Sept. 4.â A Self-confessed
accomplice In the murder of her 2-year
old daughter, whose mutilated body was
subsequently ( bathed and neatly clad in
its best clothes and then tossed into ' the
open doorway of a, West Side tenement
house,^ Agnes Hyland, aged 25 years, was
locked up to-night. '
Gustavo Denser, a plumber, .with whom
the woman lived as his housekeeper, is
also under arrest^ The mother, told the
police that Denser killed her i baby- girl
Gertrude because "it was in the way,"
and that she ..helped to dispose of . the
body. The Janitor: of the tenement this
morning stumbled' over the body, which,
wrapped in a newspaper, lay in a corner
of the" dark stairway. Physicians found
a mortal wound. on the temple, while the
face bore nine stab wounds, apparently
made by a penkni-e. .:
\u25a0 Later in the day the body was identi
fied by the jani tress of a tenement on
West Forty-fifth street, ; the home 'of the
Hyland woman. The arrest of the;moth
er and Denser "and the confession of the
former followed. .
According to \u25a0 the mother, the child,
who was an attractive,* robust youngster
with a pcof uslon of light curly j hair , and
blue * eyes, was beaten to death the pre-_
vious ;' night\ because Denser,' \ who i" has
three children of his own, objected to her
presence in the home. Later the mother
washed -the -baby to remove bloodstains,
and,: dressing it, .carried \u25a0it to. the . door
way where it .was found. "
Denser denied , the murder of the child,
to , the I support^ of which he said he had,
however,: objected." '.< He ; said that at - the
request %of the ,- mother, he had ; punished
Gertrude Sunday i night and afterward
left.' the; house.*;. When .he returned the
mother told \ him that the .child was "dead,
and he went with -her to dispose of the

LOOMIS LOSES
HIS POSITION
Robert Bacon oi New York
Appointed First Assist
ant Secretary of State
LEADER IN BUSINESS
New Official Until Recently
a Partner in J. P. Mor
gan's Banking House
OYSTER BAY, \u25a0 N. V., Sept. 4.âPresi
dent Roosevelt this afternoon announced
officially the appointment of Robert Ba
con of New York to be First , Assistant
Secretary of State, to succeed Francis B.
Lroomls. The announcement was accom
panied by a statement 'that Bacon would
not assume the duties of his office for
some time, perhaps until "about the mid
dle of October,' after Secretary Root had
become settled in the office of Secretary
of State. â¢ \u25a0\u25a0â¢"."\u25a0-;V-" ' ' ,
For years Robert Bacon - has been \u25a0 an
important figure in the business equation
of New York. Until within comparatively
recent months he was a junior partner in
the banking-house of J. P. Morgan &
Co. :At the settlement of the anthracite
coal , strike |by President Roosevelt, Ba
con represented Morgan jin two confer
ences in Washington which made for an
amicable adjustment of the trouble. Sub
sequently, when Bacon retired from the
firm of J. P. Morgan & Co., the President
determined to utilize his services if a
suitable place for him could be found.
â¢ Bacon was here to-day as, a guest of
President and Mrs. Roosevelt at lunch
eon. -
llt is expected that Loomia will relin
quish his office In a short ,time, and his
resignation will take effect 'at* the conclu
sion of a leave of absence which he pro
poses to take. No statement is made con
cerning his possible future in official life,
but, as heretofore noted in these dis
patches, .his appointment to an important
diplomatic post is problematical.

Th. schooner Torr.ado. formerly, the
Kacht Rover, whose arrival at La Pas af
ter a sir.art run from thie port was re
ported some days ago, was lyins oft the
Mexican pearJ port when the steamship
Curac;;^- left there. The Curacao arrlve^f

aStin<*. Frar.k Grc-en, a passenger on the
2%ivkca.o. was a member 6t the Tornado's
rt w and he brings v hoisse with nlm the
recollection cf a tiv.ly half-hour on the
Bchuontr's dtck between all hands and a
*&rk
L'ur.r.g a cnlni in the Gulf of California,
t big hocs.buited with porÂ« and attached
to a hta\ y wire, Tras throrvn over the

tnorstcrs migLt be in the vicinity to try
their Â£::<ngth. A shara. accepted the
:1m lens*. BvaSkmrics pork, hook and a
ttj^'.fitt cf wire wtis > asy. An attempt to
sough v? the hardware .served only to
2rlve ifce hook deeper into the shark's
interior anatctay anil with a long strong
pull the Torncdo's cr<.w landed the shark
on cÂ« ck, , The deck was small, and the
shark large, and for rifteen minutes the
s>h -was in undisputed command of the
Tornado, dcwral members of the crew
narrowly escaped injury before the man
z^Ur n-er.t to sleep, fanned into tmcori
scfousness by repeated applications of
a Â«.t.:-staa bar.
Green pave the dimensions of the shark; J
aut Capiain P.iulsen cf the Curacao saysr
r. thinks the figures will stand revision
inn that Green was thinking of the

special reference the- speeches,* of

the head of the Standard Oil Company
and declared them to be exaggerations
which only . served |to excite sympathy
for the person against whom they were
directed. Dr. Mac Arthur said: 1 "

Governor. was guilty of exaggeration which re
acted ; against himself : and in - favor of the
object of his : denunciation. 'The pendulum ! is

MAX DIES IN HOSPITAL
JohnvG. \Vilsoiis Spree and
His Life Suddenly Ended
by an Attack of Apoplexy
John G. Wile on died at the Central
Emergency Hospital about 6 o'clock yes
terday' morninc and his body was re
moved to the Morgue. There is a woman
In the .case, but Detectives Cottle and
Mitchell have been unable to discover her
Identity."
Wilson and ' the woman called at' the
Fulton, House, 6 Fulton street, on Sunday
afternoon about < o'clock and Wilson en
traged a' room from Mrs. A. Rhodes, the
landlady. \ The woman remained in the
hallway and Mrs. Rhodes did not see her.
About two hours later Dr. Marion
Thrasher, whose office is in the Muirhead
building, called at Wilson's room and
found him unconscious on the floor.
Dr. Thrasher" hurried- to the- Central
Emergency Hospital and told Dr. Glover
of Wilson's condition, and suggested 'that,
hÂ« be removed to the hospital. The am
bulance was sent te the Fulton House
and ' Wilson was taken to the hospital.
Both Dr. Thrasher and Dr. Glover diag
nosed the case as an attack- of apoplexy.
Wilson died shortly before 6 o'clock. His
body was identified at the Morgue by
Mrs. M. R. Kipp, 531 Castro street, his
eister-ln-law. Wilson was 62 years of age
ana was at times a stock' broker and a
bartender. He lived with his wife at 24
Sixth street. Mrs. Wilson was prostrated
when she heard of his death and was un
able to visit the Morgue.
Dr. Thrasher told Detectives .Cottle and
Mitchell that a 'woman called' at his.of
fice and asked him to attend a man who
had been taken suddenly ill In room 12 at
the Fulton House. She paid him; his fee
and said she did not desire to go back to
the room owing to her' family -connec
tions. â¢ He had not seen her before.
Mrs. Kipp roafle a statement.,at the
Morgue that although Wilson was always
kind and attentive to his wife he was of
a jolly disposition 'and .fond of 'the so
ciety of women. There was one married
woman with whom he had- been seen fre
quently for several years.' . "VJ-
A bottle of carbolic- acid was -found' In ;
the - room, which - gave . rise \u25a0to \u25a0. the suspi
cion that Wilson might have committed
Eujcide. but It was learned that it had
been left there by a former occupant of
the room. .': 1

drama indeed. "The Conflict" is the work'
of , Maurice V. = Samuels, "a local play
wright,' and ; was last night presented 'at;
the Majestic." '.The play was 'inspired by :
Balzac's I/Magic Skin," and is the tirst'ef
fort of <tne ! author. V 'â¢ ' '
: It was a herculean task the playwright
set himself." â¢'The Magic Skin" is hardly;
more 'ilramatizable than* the' Ten; Com-;
maridmentsâ and ' Schopenhauer onf, the
â¢Will j would ; come nearer than that. Even
Mr.V Samuels'* considerable , modifications
fof, the story , hardly help. Nor: the Intro-;
' ductlon of the very lively press agent for
California, John Bodie, whose plea : that
the .'Parisians shall ' not call" It , "Frisco"
really touchy the heart. This figure,:
curiously enough, is much the best in; the
piece, and suggests that possibly farce/
rather than fantasy,' is Mr. Samuels'
mcHler. ' , ':. -'.^^iJ.
As In the book the story goes thatf^fte
ruined; aristocrat. De Valentin, c6mes
across a made skin,% that- has the power
of granting his every wish but.one'for..
health, \u25a0on condition that he pays with
so much of his life for every wish grant-,
cd. The tend, of the ?first act finds him
wishing that the heartless woman he has
loved. shall love him in vain, and that. the
9Q-year-old party who gave him the skin;
shall > fall In love with a ballet dancer.
Mr. Nelll, who does Vthe De Valentin,
seems to ; consider him righteously pun
ished'for these very naughty wishes by -a
sort of â fit in three acts upon' which: the"
curtain goes down. â¢ v .â¢ :'â¢
The next act'opens with a scenefbe-,
tween Bodie and the bad man, who has
stolen a.mine from De, Valentin's papa.^

Central.
.- The performances yesterday of .the
border melodrama, "The : James '\u25a0
in Missouri." served; to .delight-two of ;
.the largest.audiences. ever; gathered: in
the Central Theateivr,Whlle the; play
is founded Ton: incidents .in the lives of
the noted; train-robbers,' the ;, author
has evolved a clever conception '.of
stage work." The > drania has a very
pretty love story;: running^ through, it
andis well supplied with comedy, lines, :
while the ."James ; Boys" Â» are as
men ;of many :good "qualities, '.who are;
; wronged by' their enemies.
Herschel.Mayall-as. ; Jesse: James and
True> Boardman 'as J Frank James were
heartily rewarded* by/ the audiences. for:,
their' spirited acting and"each-flme they
defeated .the plots*; of v' the ' " "Bently ,
gang,", the gallery, shouted .with glee.' ,
Henry Shu mer and George" P. â¢ Webster
were the leaders of the VBently gang.
and; they held up trains and ,blew open
express j cars with j the ,' utmost : coolness.
James Cofrigah kept .the fun alive as a
"darky, a friend of the: James boys,"
and | was ably aided |by Lillian | Elliott,
in the role of a good, natured woman,
who loves the "James :boys."
.Edna Ellsniere: again plays ; a ; wrong
ed heroine . and she : won "the sympathies
of the. women in the audience by a very,
clever impersonation. ~ George \O. Nlch
olls/ Clare Sinclare, Viol Lambert and
the balance of the company were all
good in, the role's assigned, to .them. -
, ! The | stage carpenters and electricians
play an important part: in the "James
Boys In Missouri." The \u25a0\u25a0Â» settings : \vere
massive and' quite- realistic and the
passing of a full-sized, train' and en-*
glne across the stage, : with its "hold- ,
up" and light between the train rob
bers and Strain crew and- the blowing,
up of the express cars, \ was presented
in. a vivid manner. The 'entire produc
tion was ; given with remarkable pre
cision 'and the drama is- likely to draw
crowded houses during the week.
Alhambra.
Yiddish players presented
for; thefirst time in San Francisco last
night atithe- Alhambra. Theater a bright,
merry comedy, "Chaim in America;", or
"The Burglar." There was a ; large
audience and.thejcomedy was received
with the heartiest' appreciation. '"'Chaim
in America" is a phase of ; New York
life showing in a ludicrous manner; the
trials of a new" arrival from Germany,
-whose; palpable ignorance -of the-con
ventionalities ;of his -ultra-modern sur
roundings is the c\iuse g for^ hilarious
merriment. t Ellis'F. Glickman was par
ticularly happy as Harry Harrison," a

trayed : by David \u25a0'. Schoenholtz. ; ; Miss
