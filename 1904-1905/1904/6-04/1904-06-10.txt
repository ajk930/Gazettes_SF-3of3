terday tried the suit of Charles B.
Whilden against the Columbian Bank
ing Company to recover $299 damages.
Whilden testified that his business
reputation had suffered in the amount
Fued for because the bank had re
fused payment on a check for $55 67
signed by Whilden as agent of the
Warner Company of Philadelphia.
The check was presented by the West
ern National Bank for payment, but
Â¦was refused on the ground that there
were no funds to Whilden's credit. As
a matter of fact he had money on de
posit. Cashier Hynes testified that the
error was due to a new bookkeeper,
who was not familiar with the ac
counts of depositors. The bank was
satisfied to pay Whilden for whatever
actual expense he had incurred, but
disclaimed responsibility for any dam
ages and Judge Daniells took that
I'hase of the case under advisement.

Port Arthur are capable of going to

kinson, a well-to-do merchant Â¦, of
Rochester, Wis., died on the SantajP'o
overland train at Vinita. Ariz., last
night under circumstances particularly
sad. His mother, whose home is at
Tropico, a suburb of Los Angeles, is
dying and telegrams had "been sent
to the members of the family East
calling them to her bedside. Wilkin
son became ill at Kansas City and. al
though attended by two physicians on
the train, he gradually became worse
until it was evident that he would
not recover. Yesterday morning J. J.
Wilkinson, brother of the dying man,
who was en route here from Marshall
town, Iowa, happened to pass through
the sleeper and caught a glimpse of
the sick man's face. He instantly rec
ognized him as his brother. He had
not known that his brother was on the
train, although he had traveled on it
from Kansas City. The dying man
recognized his brother, but soon re
lapsed into unconsciousness. from
which he was never aroused. .The body
was not taken off the train, but was
brought to this city, "the brother be
ing in such condition fronv-the shock
that he required the services of the
physicians. The dying mother has not
been told of the death of her son, be
cause it is feared the news would
hasten her death, which is a matter of
but a few days, at most.

Pfhe mystery of the note that was
it to Mrs. Madden, supposedly by
Â».:aptain Wild, is solved by the state
ment of Mrs. Madden. Mrs. Madden
says that the note was written by a
fi-iend of hers at Angel Island. It
merely conveyed the news of Captain
Wild's death, and in no way threw the
Flishtest Ilyht upon the cause or rea
sons of his death. This statement of :
Mrs. Madden's is also borne out by of- ;
> :T-ers conversant with the eubject.
The cause of the death of Captain
Frederick Wild is still as great a
mystery as ever. Army officials,
friends in social life and others in
whose circles he moved are at a loss to
understand what caused his sudden
taking off. Among the leading- army
< fficlals it is the impression that his
death was accidental and that it was
by the sudden explosion caused by the
dropping of bis pun. This theory Is also
hrJd by many of his friends at the Bo
hemian Club.
On the other side comes the story
cf his devotion to Mrs. Evelyn Pittman
and, if rumor be true, there was a lack
of reciprocation on her part-
Mrs. Pittman. when seen at her lux
urious apartments at 1004 McAllister
street last night, conversed very freely
"n the subject of Captain Wild's death.
She was beautifully gowned in a robe
of dark brown satin, decorated with
magnificent white lace. About her
Throat wag encircled magnlflcertt gems
ter that I cannot and will not discuss
under any consideration. Poor, dear
Fred is gone, arid to me his memory is
very sacred. I never knew any finer
gentleman, and I never expect to know
any one that had so fine a character as
he had. He was always polite and gal
lant. I am sure his death was entirely
an accident, because, so far as I know,
I can most positively assert there was
no reason for his takine his life."
"Now, Mrs. Pittman, is it not true
that Captain Wild became despondent
and reckless because you refused to
marry him?"
"I must decline to answer that
question."
"Do you decline to say that Captain
Wild was devoted to you and that he
wanted to marry, you?"
''Again I must say that I do not
want to discuss that question, and I
will not say either yes or no to your
interrogations on this subject. I can
only say we were always friends.
"Now. so far as concerning the fur
nishing of this flat is concerned, Fred
had nothing to do with it. I never ac
cepted a dollar from him in my life."
Army officials are at an utter loss to
understand the situation. They all as
sert, so far as they know, that his ac
counts with the different organizations
with which he was connected were ab
solutely otraight.
'*I had known Captain Wild for
more than two years. We had been
great friends, and I had the greatest
admiration in the world for him. He
v.as always a gentleman in the truest
sense of the word. We frequently went
out to dinner, and we always dined in
the best places in San Francisco. We
generally went to the Palace Grill.
You know, the captain was fond of
the best things In life, and we never
went to any place that was not first
class. Of course, we dined at other
restaurants occasionally â at the Poodle
Dog, Marchand's and Zlnkand's. Now.
when it comes to the 6tory that he had
anything to do In furnishing this flat,
that is a mistaken idea. I have money
of my own to keep this flat going.
"I cannot in any way understand
why Captain Wild took his life and L
shall always believe, as I do now, that
it was an accident. If he had any trou
bles of his own he never confided them
to me. Regarding the rumors that
Captain Wild wished to marry me I
positively must decline to say anything
at all upon this subject. This ia a mat-
of emeralds and pearls, and her fingers
glistened with rich Jeweled rings
studded with brilliant diamonds, jewels
and pearls of rare beauty.
As she leaned back in her luxurious
divan of soft silken pillows she dis
cussed the death of Captain Wild as
follows:

Delcasse said he received on Monday
a report from the French Embassador
at Constantinople giving the result of
the investigations of the French Con
sul sent into the Sassoun district. It
showed there had been a number of
bloody combats and .villages had been
captured by the troops and destroyed.
Eut it was impossible to estimate even
approximately the number of villages
destroyed or the number of people
killed. Some accounts said twenty
five villages and others claimed that
fifteen villages were destroyed.
There was no doubt the uprising re
sulted in the killing of many rebels and
also in the death of many peaceful
peasants. But the presence of the
French, Russian and British Consuls
vÂ»a3 beginning to restore confidence.
."I have informed the Porte," Del

LONDON. June 9.â During the dis
cussion of the Foreign Office estimates
in the House of Commons to-day Sir
Charles Dilke (Advanced . Radical)
raised the question of the administra
tion of the Congo State. He discussed
at length the report of Roger Case
ment, British Consul in the Congo
State, and advocated an appeal to the
United States to act with Great Brit
ain, pointing out that the United States
was responsible for the creation of tne
Congo Free State and saying he be
lieved that such co-operation wouM be
pregnant with great result.
The Under Secretary for Foreign Af
fairs, Earl Percy, said the British Gov
ernment thought the Congo Govern
ment would readily recognize the ne
cessity for a searching inquiry, but the
former had been disappointed.
Earl Percy, after reviewing the situ
ation in the Congo State, charged offi
cials with permitting "inhuman cruel
ties to be practiced in order that they
might profit by the collection of rub
ber."

WASHINGTON. June Â».â Reports to
the Marine Hospital service apparently
prove the theory that the destruction
of the mosquito means absence of yel
low fever. When yellow fever brake
out with great virulence at Laredo,
Texas, on the Mexican border, the pub
lic health and Marine Hospital service
at once began a vigorous war on ths
mosquito of the variety known as
Stegomyla fasciata. which transmits
disease. A recent report to the hospital
says: "The almost total absence of
mosquitoes in any portion of the city
is the subject of remark among citi
zens. Laredo never before saw ths
time when it was so clear of the string
ing, disease carrying pest as now. This
time last year mosquitoes swarmed all
over the city. It was absolutely neces
sary to sleep under a bar to obtain any
rest. Now the citizens say they do not
think of using a bar." ,^ ,,
This improved condition Is attributed
entirely to the work of the hospital
service, which has had men employed
for nearly a year In the work of de
stroying the mosquito pest.
At the request of some of the grand
jurors. Assistant District Attorney

NEW YORK, June 9.â Describing the
man who had purchased from him the
revolver with which 'Caesar" Young
was shot to death last Saturday morn
ing, H. Stern, a pawnbroker, gave a
complete description of J. , Morgan
Smith, who is married to a sister of
"Nan" Patterson.
Smith has disappeared and a warrant
of attachment was issued for him to
night by Judge Newburger.
Stern has done much to assist the po
lice in dispelling the mystery surround
ing the death of Young, and though he
has had no opportunity to confront J.
Morgan Smith, it is conceded that his
testimony is of a convincing nature.
His identification of the weapon with
which Young was shot is absolute. He
has seen a picture" of Young, and with
out hesitation he announced that it is
not a likeness of the man who bought
the revolver.
Stern made two attempts to identify
"Nan" Patterson as a woman who was
present when the purchase was made,
but he was unab.fe to do so. But when
he described thfe' man who made the
purchase It became apparent that he
was referring to J. Morgan Smith, or a
person greatly like him. "**
Thomas Meagher, a driver for Fran
cis H. Lieggett, wholesale grocer, is a
witness who has been kept in reserve
and in silence by District Attorney Je
rome. He will appear before the Grand
Jury to-morrow. He saw the cab in
which the tragedy occurred and all
that happened before the shooting. He
says "Nan" Patterson, sitting on the
left of Young, was turned Jialf around
in the cab. Her left arm -vas thrown
around Young's neck and she was
leaning forward as though about to
press her lips to his. /
This position would make it possi
ble for the woman to have brought a
revolver up with her right hand and
into a position so a3 tn deliver a bullet
which would cause just such a wound

CRUSHED TO DEATH
BY TRACTION ENGINE
TACOMA, June 9.â Rev. Peter Rowe,
Episcopal Bishop of Alaska, became
lost in March on an Alaska trail and
for three days was forced to live on
wild rabbits. The story of his experi
ence reached here to-day from Fair
bank, Alaska.
Bishop Rowe was en route from Ta
nana district to Valdes, along the sea
coast. He started out with Mail Car
rier Karsten and one companion. The
snow was deep, making the trip hard
on both dogs and drivers. They were
the first to go over the new, mall route
which runs down Golcona Valley to
Copper River. They got off the trail
one day and thereby missed Mall Car
rier Foyne,. inbound, whom they ex
pected to meet-'.vith provisions. When
they got hack on the trail Foyne had
passed. This necessitated three days'
diet .on such rabbits as they could kill.
At the end. of that, time they reached a
mining camp and obtained food. Car
rier Karsten says Bishop Rowe proved
himself a prince of travelers, never
once complaining. '

when they signified their intention of
moving away on the following day. v
Foley demanded the keys of the house.
The old couple declined to give these
up until new quarters could be secured.
This refusal led to a row between
Foley and Whelan. Wlfelike, Mrs.
Whelan went to the assistance of her
husband. Then Foley turned on her
and sank his teeth into her arm, lacer

CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. June 9.â The most in
teresting gossip in political circles to
day was a story that at the proper mo
ment William R. Hearst will swing his
delegates to Senator Gorman; that
Guffey will switch Pennsylvania; that
Tammany will start a revolt of cheer
ing for Gorman and that New Jersey
will fall into line with Maryland and
West Virginia. One of Senator Gor
man's close friends Is quoted as saying:
"I cannot verify the report, but it
does not seem improbable. The late
Senator Hearst was a devoted friend
and admirer of Senator Gorman and
the young man himself has frequently
sought the advice of Senator Gorman
in his political movements."
Hearst is building for the future. The
theory is that by allying himself with
Tammany against Judge Parker he is
not only seeking revenge, but is mak
ing friends with Tammany, with Gor
man and with Guffey for the future.
The combination, if effected, would
give Senator Gorman about 250 votes
on the first ballot, not to speak of pres
tige of the backing of such leaders as
Guffey, Murphy and Hearst.

STOCKTON, June 9.â Mayor \W,ill

the water front difficulties. For three
days he has been having conferences
with both sides, and this morning he
was sent a communication by the Mill

This is the final disposition of the
"liquor cases" of the United States

of French cordials and the cases grew
out of a dispute with the French Gov

The six delegates from Utah to the Na

leaning toward Parker as first choice.
Two â¢ delegates probably will support
Hearst.
For some time before the Democratic
State Convention, which met to-day, it
seemed almost certain that a bitter
factional fight would be waged over
the question of instructions or no in
structions to the national delegates
with reuard to the polygamy question.
One faction, led by Brigham H. Rob
erts, was outspoken in its demands
that thfr delegates should be explicitly
instructed to fight any anti-polygamy
plauk in the national platform. An
other faction strongly favored the
adoption. ota plank in the State'plat

junction is sued for an attempt will be
made to arrest Burns himself on the
criminal charge that he .incited riot. It
is not claimed that there is ground for
an accusation that- Burns ' personally
incited a riot, the implication being
that he should be held partly respon
sible for the recent troubles at Cripple
Creek, because he maintained the union
by giving employment to union miners.
Burns, it is further reported, will
also ask that the military be with
drawn from the vicinity of his property
in Victor and that he be allowed to
protect his men when they go back to
w^jrk.
James F. Burns, president of the
Portland Company, is in Denver and is
closeted with his attorneys, who, it is
said, are preparing papers which will
be filed in the United States Circuit
Court, asking for a restraining order to
prevent further interference upon the
part of the State military authorities
with the operation of the Portland
mine.
The Portland Gold Mining Company
being a foreign corporation, incorporat
ed under the la'ws of Iowa, it is claimed
by eminent lawyers that any act af
fecting it may be reviewed by the
United States courts.
DENVER, Colo., June 9.â The closing

for Alexander Pontan. recently a cook

derer of J. A. Valentine, a mining ex
pert, whose body was found In a cabin
near Callente.
A letter from E. B. Kersey, post
mistress at Plute, was received to-day
by H. Yarnell, a local mining man. In
this letter the writer states that Pon
tan and another man hired a livery
rig at Mojave last week and were seen
to stop at the Sixteen-mile House.
A year ago Alexander . Pontan and
Ike Bryson, son of Millionaire John
Bryson of Los Angeles, made a trip to
the same mining claim visited with
fatal results by Valentine. On that
trip, according to Bryson, Pontan
played the part of a maniac, compell
ing Bryson at the point of a revolver
to make a wild drive of several hours
through the rugged mountain region.
Fipally the horses ran away, the rig
was smashed and in the general mix
up Bryson escaped.

HEARST'S PACT
WITH GORMAN
1 VICTOR^ Colo., June 9. â The commis
sion appointed by General Bell to in
quire into ! the records of the miners
under arrest reported to him to-day a
list of ninety-seven union miners with
the recommendation that they be de
ported. General. Bell accepted the re
port .and announced/ that the men
would be sent out of Teller County as
soon as a special train could be ar
ranged for.
It was Intended early in the day to
begin the deportations at once, but the
raid on the Portland mine and smaller
affairs kept the military busy, and
General Bell at 7 o'clock this evening
said there would be no deportations
to-night. It is said, however, that they
will begin to-morrow and continue until
all of the men whom the mine owners
consider objectionable are out of the
district.
VICTOR, Colo.. June 9. â In a blood
less assault made by 150 militiamen and
deputies, led by Adjutant General
Sherman M. Bell, on the Portland mine
to-day, the mine wag indefinitely
closed, to be reopened later on terms
which will prevent any workmen ob
taining employment - without present
ing satisfactory working cards from
the Mine Owners' Association. :General
Bell says the mine was closed because
of "military necessity," &e the mÂ«jn
working in it were contributing to the
support of the strikers. Â¦'Â¦-
The general and his force marched
up to the mine, took possession, read
the proclamation concerning the pres
ent disposition of the mine and then
left with the employes of the company
in charge of the plant. Following the
closing of the Portland it was an
nounced that the mines will begin to
reopen to-morrow, the non-union mines
first and the others later, and that busi
ness is to be resumed in the district at
once. All miners who want work must
first secure a working card' from the
Mine Owners' Association.
It was arranged that twenty-four of
the Portland's employes should be left
in charge to guard the property and
keep necessary parts running, and
General Bell assured the superintend
ent that he would furnish all the
guards ncessary to help protect the
mine.

CUIPPLE CREEK, Colo.. June 9.â
"Death to * unionism in the Cripple
Creek District," is the new slogan of
the Citizens' Alliance, which has sent
a decree broadcast that every person
connected' with any union here must
either sever his or her connection with
such organization or leave the dis
trict. No person who works fpr a liv
ing will be exempt and the absolute
annihilation of unionism in this county
will be attempted.
Two committees, composed of mem
bers of the Citizens' AUiance, started
out with identical forms of agreement
to secure signatures. With two excep
tions all business houses visited signed
through authoritative representatives,
the agreement reads:
"We, the undersigned merchants of
the Cripple Creek District and em
ployers of help, hereby agree not to
employ help of any kind that is In
any way connected with the trades as
sembly or the American Federation of
Labor, or the Western Federation of
Miners, or kindred organizations."
Every clerk employed in stores on
Bennett avenue, the principal, street,
belongs to some union, but all will be
required to surrender their cards, ac
cording to agreement made by their
employers.
SECOND "BULLPEN" IN USE.

tive body.
The Committee of Safety has made a
demand upon District Attorney Trow
bridge that he remove his deputy, J. C.
Cole, and that S. D. Crump be appoint
ed to fill the vacancy. So far no reply
has been' received from Trowbridge.
S. D. Crump, whom the committee ask
ed to have appointed, is the attorney
for the Mine Owners' Association.

The Sultan's troops at Tangier have

TANGIER, Morocco. June 9.â The
American Consul has sent two unarmed

lated house and as the Count, her hus
band, is at Fez, the marines were sent
to her home as a precautionary meas
ure. These are the only American-ma
rines landed here.
The necessity for the better policing
of Tangier Is fully recognized here, and
officials say one result of the Incident
will be the permanent establishment
of a police administration under foreisn

released.
SACRAMENTO. June 9. â As the re
sult of a legal blunder, the campaign
for a $200,000 high school is off. For
several' years Sacramento has been
endeavoring to secure a modern high
school and about two months ago the
Board of Trustees resolved to call an
election for the issuance of $200,000
in bonds for the purpose. Corporation
Counsel Donnelly was directed to pre
sent the necessary formula and in ac
cordance therewith plans were
adopted, the election proclamation
published and the printing of a new
Great Register contracted for. In the
proclamation Donnelly, it appears,
provided for the repayment of the debt
at the rate of $4000 a year, which
would take fifty years to obliterate.
Under* the State law a, municipality
cannot incur a debt extending over a
period of more than forty years, and
when this fact was discovered to-day
the campaign for the new high school
suffered a collapse. Some of the City
Trustees express the hope , that tlfe
proceedings can be entered upon anew
and that the only , loss resultant from
the legal oversight will be about $1000,
representing the expense to date.

the discovery that he had been stealing
for years. His peculations will amount
tq several thousand dollars, but it is
doubtful If he can be prosecuted for
more than petty larceny, because he
was careful not to steal $50 worth of
goods at any one time.

Fleming is well known in this com
munity, where he has resided ever
*inee 1S7T. He was born in Spencer.
Worcester County. Mass.. in ISoS and
is a high scl*>ul graduate. He was
identified with the shoe trade in this
< ity for thirteen years and was chief
deputy under County Clerk Haley in
US3. He has since been in the insur
ance business and is now associated'
with J. W. Amiath as an expert ac
countant. Fleming is regarded by the
Health Board to be in every way qual
ified for the wardenship.
The board notified the Chief of Po
lice that he must take charge of the
juvenile offenders on and after the first
of July, thereby relieving the Central
Emergency Service of the expense in
i idt-nt thereto.
TIjp position of waiter at the hospital
held by Albert Roper was declared va
cant.
P. R. Hennessy was appointed ex-
I*-r:<?need clerk in the Health Office
from the civil service eligible list.
Health Officer Ragran reported that
be had detailed District Health Officers
Tillman and Adler to prosecute the
v.ork of dairy inspection and to edu
cate the dairymen in the requirements
of the board relative to producing a
cipan milk supply.
Ragan also reported that he had
filed ferrcal charges with the Civil
. < ' rvice Commission against Dairy In
spectors Smith and O'Connor, who
have been suspended for dereliction of
duty.
The Board of Health yesterday re
moved John N. Elbert, warden of the
City and County Hospital, and ap
pointed Martin W. Fleming to the po
sition. There was no discussion when
the two resolutions were adopted, it
being understood that Elbert was re
tired because he had proven a poor
disciplinarian and owing to frequent
clashes with his subordinates. Elbert
wsls asked to resign and at a secret
conference with the board Just pre
vious to the meeting refused to do so.
The board proceeded in a body to the
hospital to give its support to the new
warden, who was at once installed in
office.
TACOMA. June 9. â Yukon steamers
have been in greater danger of de
struction during the ice break-up this
spring than ever before. The steamer
Leah of the Northern Commercial
fleet sunk at Cliff Creek while sliding
off a huge cake of ice. The steamers
Louise and Susie succeeded in rais
ing her and she has. been taken to
Dawson for repairs.
The steamer .Robert Kerr was
caught by a Jam near Circle and saved
with much difficulty. The steamer
Lightning was caught in the ice in a
dangerous position near Washington
Creek last fall. By the impact of the
icÂ£ she was forced completely out of
the river and upon the bank. She
was safely launched in May and sub
sequently reached Dawson. A num
ber of steamers' above Dawson had
similar narrow escapes.
Several of Them Are Badly Damaged

SAN BERNARDINO, June 9.â
Differences existing between Principal
W. L.' Brown of the local High School
and Miss Vida Sherman, teacher of
I^atin, have been taken up by the
students. They have marked the
sidewalk in front of the school with
expressions denunciatory of Brown,
and the School Board is investigat
ing the matter. Two of the students
of the graduating class, Fred M.
Meyer and George Dicson, have con
fessed to having had a hand in the
matter. A number of expulsions are
looked for.

The attempt was jnade at Bloody
Run, where the track runs high above
the Rogue River. As the engine
rounded a curve Engineer Gray saw a
tie placed across the rails. He applied
the air brakes at once and the engine
slid forward. When the collision came
the tie was picked" up and carried eight
rail lengths forward. By this time the
passangers, alarmed at the sudden
jarring of the brakes and the crash
of broken glass from the rock hurled
into the car, were dropping from the
train. When it was ascertained that
only Gray's' clear headedness had
saved 'their lives, a purse was made
up and presented to- him.
Jt is believed both by the officers here
and by the passengers themselves that
a tramp ejected from a freight train
had taken this method of revenging
himself.* The company has offered a
reward of $250 for the arrest of the
miscreant.
The would-be wrecker was foiled by
the coolness of Engineer E. L. Gray
and the train reached- Portland in
safety this morning.
Mrs. Gavin McNab of San Francisco.
Mrs. Henshaw and Miss Stone of Oak
land arid-Jay W. Adams, coast passen
ger agent of the Nickel Plate Road,
were among the prominent Califor
nians on the train.
PORTLAND, June 9.â Just as the
northbound Southern Pacific passenger*
train No. 16 struck a "i placed on the
track three miles south of Grants Pass
last evening a Jagged stone was hurled
through a window- of a sleeping car.
It had evidently been thrown by a
miscreant who after deliberately at
tempting to wreck the train had wait
ed to see his fiendish work accom
plished. .

TUCSON. Ariz.. June 9.â The busi
ness set". ion on the American side of
the border of Nosales narrowly escaped
destruction to-night by a fire which
destroyed the United States Customs
house, the Southern Pacific depot the
Wells-Fargo and Western Union build
ings and fifteen loaded boxcars. The
Customs-house was the headquarters
for the district of Arizona and New
Mexico, and valuable Government ~
ords were stored in the building:.
No rain in seven months had ren
dered the structures combustible ' as
powder and the strong desert wind
threatened for a time to carry destruc
tion to the entire business section. No
gales is the point of entry for nearly
all Sonora, and immense amounts of
freight pass through" the depot and
Customs-house every day, so that
great inconvenience will be experienced
for a time.

DOAN'S KIDNEY PILLS.
"TiPOTATiON.
How Xt Wai Made sad Retained In Saa
Franclico.
A good reputation Is not easily earned
and it was only by hard, consistent
I work among our citizens that Doan's
Kidney Pills won their way to the prolid
distinction attained in this locality. The
public endorsement of scores of San
Francisco residents has rendered invalu-
able service to the community. Read
what this citizen says: _
K F. T. Collins, silk hatter, of 1010%
Hyde street, says: "It is a difficult mat-
ter to give greater praise to Doan's Kid-
ney Pills than their remarkable proper-
ties deserve. For several years ; I was
bothered more or less with kidney com-
plaint, particularly if I contracted a
cold, which was-tTure to seat itself in the
region of my back Just over the kidneys.
I fooled around for a long time trying
medicine of various kinds, none of which
even helped, and finally Mrs.- Collins,
who had. been reading considerable about
Doan's Kidney Pills, advised me to take
a course of the treatment. If the first
box had not brought results I can posi-
tively guarantee this, I never would
have bought a secondhand if the second
had not stopped the last attack, and
what Is better there has not been a
symptom of a recurrence for six months,
r could not-be induced under. any cir-
cumstances to - publicly recommend the
preparation.'.-- , -

1016 Broadway, June 9.
Oakland newsboys are showing that
they have the instincts of detectives.
Yesterday they gave Coroner H. B.
Mehrmann a tip that may prove valu
able in determining the cause of the
death of Samuel Rhodes, who was him
self an Oakland newsboy.
William Cody, a boilermaker's helper,
on strike from the Santa Fe shops at
Point Richmond, . was taken Into cus
tody to-night at the City Prison. This
was done at the request of Coroner
Mehrmann and Cody will be held
pending an Inquest in the case of Sam
uel Rhodes, a newsboy, whese body
was found on, the Southern Pacific
Company's tracks, at Cedar and Ninth
streets, last hight.
CODY'S QUEER ACTION*?.
Cody claims to have been in company
with RhodesYwhen the latter was
struck and killed by a Berkeley local
train after the pair had Jumped from a
freight train on which they had rid
den from Sacramento.
What ffave rise to suspicions In the
Coroner's mind was the fact that Cody
had not voluntarily come to him and
made explanations. Instead, according
to his own deposition taken to-night,
Cody left his companion for dead and
by a round-about route through the
railroad yards went to the home of his
father, John Cody, at 1475 Third street.
Young Cody said nothing to his father
about the affair, nor did he mention it
to any one until this afternoon, when
he casually said to a group of news
boys that he had seen Rhodes killed.
Later, upon their urgent demands, Co
dy went to the Morgue, but left a fic
titious address. The newsboys traced
him and this evening Coroner Mehr
mann took charge of the young man.
HIS EXPLANATION.
In explanation of his conduct, Cody
said':
"Rhodes and I met at Sacramento
and came down on the freight train.
After we jumped off it was ! hardly a
minute before the Berkeley train came
along and I tried to grab Sam, but it
was too late. When I saw him lying
dead on the tracks I was so frightened
that I ran away. I .didn't say anything
about it until I met the newsboys to
day. I was simply scared to death."
Examination of Rhodes' body showed
no external marks of violence except a
bruise on the temple. Coroner Mehr
mann postponed the inquest until Sat
urday night that an autopsy might be
held and time given for Investigation
by the police.
"I am not prepared to make any
charges," said the Coroner, "but I had
Cody locked up so as to be on the safe
side. His explanation is not entirely
satisfactory."

Many Umpires In Evidence.
It was announced yesterday that
Umpire Jack Huston would be re
leased on Sunday night. President
Bert received four telegrams re
garding the umpire situation. One
was from. Jim McDonald, announ
cing that his health was Improved
and that he would be ready to go
north. Another came from Tom
Browne, stating that he started from
Washington and would report at
Portland. The third was from Jack
McCarthy, announcing that he had
trouble with the Northwestern
League officials and would like a Job
here. The last happened to come
from President Lucas of the North
western League asking President Bert
to recommend him a good man. It
appears Huston will go to Lucas, and
therefore the only man out of a Job
is McCarthy, and he will probably
soon catch on.
Davis Estate Incorporates.
The Jacob Z. Davis Estate Company
yesterday filed articles of incorpora
tion, with a capital stock of $1,000.
000. The incorporators are Isabella
M. Curtis, Elizabeth M. Muir, William
G. Mugan, John M. Curtis and Joseph
C. Campbell. Isabella Curtis and Eliz
abeth Muir hold 4998 and 4999 shares
of stock respectively. They were
nieces of Davis' first -wife and his will,
in which they were named as the chief
beneficiaries, was found in the urn
holding the ashes of the first Mrs. Da
vis. A long contest of the will, in
which it was alleged the document
was a forgery, followed, the present
incorporators winning: the battle.
For several days Munro had been
looking for his former assistant, but in
vain. The story came of Herspring's
suicidal attempt and it was an easy
matter to trace him. Her?pring had
recovered this afternoon and was
transferred to the City Jail. He re-
Fides at 210 Second street.
Though he had hidden his identity
under a fal*e name, a published de
ei-ription of Herppring disclosed his real
etlf to J. A. Munro, an auctioneer of
this city and recently Hersprings em-
X'ioyer. Munro had sworn to a warrant
charging the man with the larceny of
n.oney while Her?pring was in his em
ploy. \
Wunro al6o claims that H'-rspring
b<irrow*rd money by fraudulently using
his name.
Joseph Herspring went to-day form
a hospital ward to a cell in the City
Prison, after hie life had been saved
through vigorous effort on the part of
the staff at the Receiving Hospital.
Ilemorseful and despondent, Herspring
tried yesterday afternoon to commit
tujridc by drinking electrical battery
fluid.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, June 9.
Attorney A. L. Frlck*. who defended
Blake, asked but three questions of
the defendant upon direct examination.
In reply to the first Blake said that he
had met Miss. Cronin on the night of
the attack and in response to the sec
ond denied that he had assaulted her.
As his third answer Blake denied that
he had on a light suit of clothes en
the night the battery was committed.
Upon cross-examination by Deputy
District Attorney Brown Blake dis
played an uncertainty of memory con
cerning dates and the suits of clothes
he had and wore at different times.
Other witnesses who gave testimony
were Detective George Brown, R. An
derson and the defendant's mother.
Composing the jury were D. Upton, Ira
Sanford, S. McHenry, B. T. Scott, D.
Graham, Alfred Clement, I. N. Chap
man, C. F. Banta, E. Loeee and C. C.
Volberg. There is still another charge
of battery against Blake, preferred by
Miss Annie Seebeck, who was beaten
In the same manner as Misa Cronin
and who identifies Blake as her assail
ant.
When she screamed for help D. E.
Peddler, Mho had been standing at the
corner of Park street and Santa Clara
avenue, went to her assistance and was
told by the young woman of the attack
that had been m&de upon her. While
Peddler was escorting Miss Cronin
along Santa Clara avenue toward her
home they met Blake coming directly
toward them. Peddler noticed that he
was panting and breathing heavily and
stopped him, asking the youth if he
was not the person who had assailed
the young woman. Blake denied that
he was and in response to questions
put him by Peddler Baid that he had
been feeding, a horse at High street;
that his name was Blake, and that he
lived on Walnut street. Miss Cronin
would not positively identify Blake
while Peddler held him, saying that she
dreaded the notoriety it would bring
her.
As soon as Peddler released the
youth he hurried away, and then it was
that MissX^ronln informed Peddled that
the person he released was the one who
attacked her. Peddler corroborated the
young woman's testimony, and Blake
himself testified that he had met them
both and identified them in court as
the same persons he had encountered
on the night Miss Blake was beaten.
THREE QUESTIONS ASKED".
SCREAMS. BKi^G HELP.
Miss Cronin was positive in her iden
tification of the defendant aa the man
who attacked and beat her. She re
lated how she had observed him stand
ing on the northeast corner of Santa
Clara avenue and Park street when she
alighted from an electric car and how
he had followed her north along Santa
Clara and grasped her by the throat
when she was near Pine street, pum
meled her about the head with his
clenched fists and kicked her brutally.
ALAMEDA, June 8.â Milton Blake,
accused by the police of being "Jack
the Swatter," who has terrorized wom
en and children here for the past five
months and against whom a charge of
battery had been preferred by Miss
Kate Cronln, one of his victims, was
tried- before a Jury In City Justice K.
B. Tappan's court this afternoon, but
no verdict was reached, the Jury stand
ing six for conviction and nve for ac
quittal after being o-ut three-quarterB
of an hour. Blake will be tried again
on the Cronin charge, as the police
feel certain that he is "Jack the
Swatter" and that they have a strong
case against him.
The scope of this work was then out
lined. One committee was sending cir
culars to people in the various walks
of life asking them to fill out blanks
stating what they regarded was the
lowest . estimate for the yearly ex
penses of- a married man, 35 years old,
with a wife and two children to sup
port, taking Into consideration what
was required of men in any profession
al walk of life.
An average of the returns already
received was as follows:
Rent, $326; light and fuel. $S9: table. $419;
additions to equipment. $W; service. $208;
clothing, man, $100;. Â¦ clothing, wife. $125;
laundry. $C4; literature. $23; books, $2&;
charity, $<": amusements, $18" carfare. $51;
summer outing, $81; doctor. $M>; Insurance,
5190; conventions, etc.. $49. Total. $2113.
This work, it was stated, was to be
continued throughout the year. The
aim of it is to demonstrate that the
remuneration of teachers is not suffi
cient to get the best, talent. Women
are filling the positions, because they
can live more cheaply and have fewer
persons dependent upon them. It was
maintained that the quality of the
work can only be raised by an in
crease in the salary. The figures now
being compiled, . the club believed,
would show conclusively that men with
the ability to make . teachers , could
make more money In other lines of
work and there was danger that the
rising generations were being left to
the care of mediocre talent.
The Teacht-rs" Club of Alameda
County addressed the Board of Educa
tion this evening upon the question
of higher wages. Though the rates
have- already been fixed by the board
for the ensuing year, the members of
the club Â«tate that the work now be
ing done by them is in view of future,
rather than Immediate benefits.
Principal I. D. .Martin' of the Grant
School was the main speaker. He di
rected the attention of the board to
the fact that the School Department
was being used by men an a stepping
stone to other professions, while no
other profession was being deserted for
that of teaching. His conclusions were
that the inducements offered men were
not sufficient to hold them and in this
connection he said:
To gather data upon which estimates may
be based, the Teachers" Club of Alameda
County has gone systematically to work and
divided this work among a number of com
mittees. We wish to compare the wages paid
to the schoolteacher* of this city with the
wages paid to men In other profession!!; taking
into consideration, ol course, the necessary
training and experience required of applicants
for positions in the clt/ schools.

a mining claim near Dawson with her
brother, Henry C. Quiner. â¢â¢
Brother and Bister had both gone
north in search of a fortune. To some
extent they had been successful. The
wife now claims that Hepworth wanted
only hfr money; that after their mar
riage ne drank and gambled, and that
she gave him about $5000 of what she
had saved to pay his debts. In Octo
ber, while living at Forty-mile he left

"San Francisco wins the next an

Association of Chiefs of Police over
Detroit and Toronto by a majority of
thirty votes, which was afterward
made unanimous." - .
Major Richard D. Sylvester of Wash
ington, D. C, was elected president of
the association. ' .
When Chief Wlttman left ten days
ago to attend the annual convention of
the Chiefs of Police of the United
States and Canada he intimated that
he would use his utmost endeavors to
get the convention to come to this city
next year. He was backed up by the
California Promotion Committee and
Mayor Schmitz sent a personal letter
to the convention extending a hearty
welcome to its members should they
decide to carry into effect the wishes
of the Chief.
That Wittman has been successful
was learned from a dispatch the chief
sent to Mayor Schmitz yesterday. The
message says:
Heads of Police Departments of 'the

places in the Bible. Every. sacrifice
was assumed to be vitally connected

first fruits, tithes (Lev. li, 12;
xxvil, 30). and gifts for maintaining
the priests and endowing the sanc

ACCORDING to press reports from London and
Paris the presence of Admiral Chadwick's fleet at
Tangier upon its mission of hope for Perdicaris,
the American citizen now being held for ransom by a*
Moorish long sword, has set the diplomatic hive of
Europe to humming. Spain is credited with a very un
easy apprehension concerning the ultimate purpose of
the American fleet and it is. said that she has even ex
changed notes with the powers anent the subject of her
disquieting fears. The belief that Uncle Sam wants a
port on the west coast of Morocco, seems to be the
nightmare that is disturbing the tranquil sleep of
fonso's kingdom; but with all diplomatic finesse his min
isters disclaim any distrust of "their great and good
friend â the United States.
How delicately adjusted are the scales of modern
diplomatic activity has never been so aptly demonstrated
as in the present instance.! A dirty Bedouin, who proba
bly rides a flea-bitten camel and daubs his hair with
goose grease . in true oriental luxuriance, pounces upon
a United . States citizen and with an English citizen as
his "other prize hurries off the twain into some desert
fastness, there calmly to swoke his narghile until some
body "comes through", with a good round ransom. Im
mediately the springs' of. action are set in play. An
American fleet moves,. ;a British', fleet moves, France

The Iceman's Dream.
Icebergs are the product of the
Greenland glaciers and are formed by
the thousand in the far northern
fiords, writes P. T. McGrath, in "The
Perils of the Icebergs," in June Me-
Clure's. As the glaciers sweep into the
sea they "calve," or throw off mighty
blocks, and these are what we know
as icebergs. Some are of stupendous
dimensions. Dr. Kane's Arctic expedi
tion saw one two and one-half miles
long and two and one-half miles wide
aground in half a mile of water in Mel
ville Bay. This, of course, broke up
into small pieces in time, which sun
and sea and tide molded into the beau
tiful and fantastic forms familiar to
the Arctic voyager. As they drift
south and the sun plays on the facade
It melts them into shimmering cas
cades which leap into the sea, while be
low the tide frets them into delicate
traceries. Then the berg gets top
heavy, turns over, and exhibits an ab
solutely new contour, and so the pro
cess continues until they disappear in
the Gulf Stream. The Labrador cur
rent which carried them on its bosom
extends from the Polar Sea, to the
south of Newfoundland, an oceanic
river 2000 miles long and 100 miles' wide
and generously bejeweled with these
gorgeous creations; and, as an.irrev
erent tourist remarked last summer,
they represent enough cold storage to
put the Ice Trust out of business and
give every American citizen a refrig
erator stock of his own*
Where the Money Goes.
The Prince of Monaco has gracious
ly consented to let the mystery of his
finances be unveiled in the Figaro. He
would have done this before if he had
thought that the world took any in
terest in the matter, according to the
London Chronicle. But he has been
brought to see that it is injurious to
his reputation to have it generally be
lieved that he lives out of the tribute
of the gaming tables at Monte Carlo.
The Monaco budget Is duly presented
in the Figaro, and it appears that the
principality has an ample revenue
quite apart from the gamblers. Why,
a thousand a . year is raised upon
matches alone! The company which
provides the refreshing sea baths of
Monaco, to say nothing of the theater
and sports, pays a handsome contribu
tion. So modest are the Prince's per
sonal wants that his Minister of
Finance has not given him a half
penny for three years. The total in
come from the Casino is devoted to the
cause of charity and the advancement
of science. "If you have lost all your
money at the tables, be consoled by
the thought that it is healing some
poor creature In the hospital, or other
wise spreading the arts of peace."
This should be inscribed in letters of
gold over the portals of the Casino.
ST. ELMO'S LIGHT â Subscriber.
LJvermore, CaL St! Elmo's light or
fire is the popular name for an appear
ance, sometimes seen, especially in
southern climates, during thunder
storms, of a brush or star of light at
the tops of the masts of vessels, at tha
end of ship's yards, or on spires or
other pointed objects. It is occasion
ally* accompanied by a hissing noise,
and is evidently of the same nature
as light caused by electricity from
points connected with an e-lectrical
machine. It Is said in Grecian myth
ology that Castor and Pollux, who
were esteemed mighty helpers *of men,
appeared as the light flames on ship'a
masts as' described.. The ancient
mariners looked upon the appearance
of these balls of light on their vessels
as a sign that they had nothing to
fear from a storm.

Tattooing tfte Eye.
That the color of a person's eye can
be changed by the use of tattoo needles
has been shown by an operation per
formed at the Massachusetts Eye and
Ear Infirmary, Boston, Mass., by Dr.
Henry H. Haskell, a specialist, and Dr.
Hefferman, the house surgeon.
The patient was a young man who
had been suffering some time with an
affection which partly destroyed the
color of his eye, but affected the
sight of that eye only slightly, says the
Jeweler's Circular. The eye contained 4
white streak, extending almost entirely
around the pupil.
The Instrument used consisted of flva
ordinary cambric needles, placed side
by side, with the eye end3 inserted in
a handle. The needle points were then
inserted into the sclerotic coating to a
depth of not more than one-sixty
fourth of an inch, each Insertion mak
ing five tiny holes. This was repeated
several times, requiring the greatest
care. To pierce the cornea would mean
an irreparable Injury to the sight./
A solution of India ink, previously
shaded to match the eyes as nearly as
possible, was rubbed in with a finger,
and worked into each of the holes made
by the needle points. The patient felt
no 111 effects.
Maybe Not.
Indicative of the fact that a touch
of the humorous is sometimes found
even during the ceremonies- attendant
upon the last rites over the dead, an
amusing incident occurred several
weeks ago at a local crematorium.
An aged gentleman of Swedish ex
traction for whom the appellation
"Ole Olsen" will serve all purposes
answered the final summons after a
brief illness. In deference to a re
quest embodied in his last will and
testament, arrangements were com
pleted for the incineration of the re
mains. Upon the day of the funeral
among those" who followed all that
was earthly of Olsen to the sleeping
city of the dead were two boyhood
companions, Jans and Hans. After the
last hymn had been sung those pres
ent filed mournfully around the cas
ket for a last look at the face of the
departed. Jan and Hans secured per
mission from the superintendent to
watch the final disposition of the body.
The attendants courteously explain
ed the system of cremation and al
lowed Olsen's two old friends to look
into the retort, where* roared the
white flames. The old fellows shud
dered. At last the body was prepared
and as the Inanimate form in its
snow white shroud was consigned to
the fire Hans in a voice trembling with
emotion was heard to say to his
friend:
"I tell you, Yan, if poor Ole bain
alive now he wouldn't stand for dose."
As the two old cronies with tear-be
dimmed eyes walked armÂ«n arm from
the chamber it was with difficulty
that the black gowned attendants re
pressed their smiles.
WE have had many foreign critics of American
life and in that respect we say with St. Paul we
are "a debtor both to the wise and the unwise,
both to the Greek and to the barbarian." By i this time
we are well accustomed to all the vagaries of the critic
tribe, and know how to smile when they try to be witty
at our expense and how to be indifferent when they un
dertake to flatter us. We are interested now only when
one of them presents us with something of a novelty in
the way of theory. Such critics are rare, but occasion
ally they show themselves, and, one of the best is a cer
tain Emil Reich, who, after "five unbroken years of so
journ in the United States," contributes the result of
his studies and his observations to the London National
He says at the outset: "Peschel and many other
eminent geographers have long ago proved that the
Northern American continent is. physiographically
speaking, very much inferior to Europe." He adds:
"Geopolitically it is certain that America is placed in
both a new and inferior position. If there is one thing
which follows with absolute and indubitable clearness
from European history it is the fact that each nation in
modern Europe was made infinitely less by its own
spontaneous efforts than by the necessity of averting the
hostility and aggression, military and otherwise, of its
immediate neighbors. * Â¦? *' The. geopolitical neces
sity of fighting for every rood of land has never existed
in America. * * * The reader, remembering the im
portance necessarily to be attached to fight and struggle
against enemies as the formative agent of historical pro
gress, will ask whence there comes the undeniable
energy so characteristic of the people of the United
States. In reality the question is answered by a consid
eration of the foreigner as one of the richest types of
history. The Americans so far as the .majority is con
cerned arc still what in every European country would
be considered foreigners."
Having thus stated that our country is physiographi
cally and geopolitically inferior to Europe and that as a
race we suffer so much under those disadvantages that
we are sustained only by an influx of foreigners, ouiÂ»
critic goes on to say that the third great difference be
tween America and Europe is the American woman.
Upon that point he says: "The American woman, es
pecially in the course of the last fifty years, has assumed
an outward tone and an,, internal attitude diametrically
opposed to what it is customary to esteem as feminine
in Europe." Conceding that the American woman is
bright, energetic and ambitious, the critic asserts that
none" the less she is the source of greatest danger to the
republic. The "incredible host of boarding-houses with
which the land is eaten up" he attributes to the disin
clination of American women to keep house. He adds:
"One of the most serious questions which clouds the
already threatening future of America is the breakdown
of American maternity. * * * Statistics -reveal that
the United States can in no wise depend for its future
prosperity. upon! the offspring of its own women." He
concludes ,that phase of his review by saying: "It is
hopeless to attempt. to offer any solution of this grave
and immense problem. Many a state has been brought
to ruin by its women."
The American man is credited with many good quali
ties, but he, too, is found to be seriously defective. Our
critic puts it this way: "The American man is lacking
in natural completeness. We may say that each nation
has the women it merits. The Americans have been
unable to create that form of womanhood which in
Europe is esteemed best. The American consequently
lacks many of the influences which such women alone
can bring to bear."
Suchi being the conditions of our' country, our poli-^
tics, our women and our men, there remains the ques
tion: Can anything save us?. Our critic says that sal
vation, is not impossible, provided we get into war with
all Europe and thus obtain the discipline which war
against heavy odds alwa'ys imposes upon heroic souls.
Such a war he deems to be quite probable as a result
of the world-wide commercial antagonisms sure to re
sult from the construction of the Panama canal and
the opening of the Orient to twentieth century energies.
He, concludes by saying: "Should the Americans give
up the Monroe doctrine, should they enter on secular
conflicts with Europe, then, and then alone, will they be
able, in case of success, to aggrandize themselves to a
power of the first "rank, or eventually of unique great
ness." Here certainly is a theory so interesting it can
be fairly classed among the things described as "im
portant, if true.";

5 HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, May 27.â Not for
a long while has any more absurd
mandate been issued from a Govern
ment department than the British
Board of Agriculture's new regulation,
which has Just gone Into effect, requir
ing all dogs reaching these shores from
abroad to wear for six months there
after a sort of harness of a most extra
ordinary pattern. People who are In
the habit of taking their canine pets
with them on their travels are in a
huff over the measure, and as it will
be enforced ; with undiscrimlnatlng
stringency against dogs brought over
by American visitors the matter Is one
that will Interest many readers In the
United States.
The official reason given for this or
der is the necessity of protecting Brit
ish stay-at-home dogs from the dan
ger of being infected with rabies by
foreign dogs, though how the Board of
Agriculture's canary-colored' harness is
to have the slightest effect one way or
the other on the spread of hydropho
bia is one of those inscrutable govern
mental mysteries which hopelessly baf
fles the ordinary understanding. But
the edict has g*one forth and must be
obeyed or divers severe pains and pen
alties will be incurred by the offend
ing dog or its owner. With that mi
nute attention to petty and superflu
ous details which characterizes most
acts of British officialdom microscopic
directions are given as to how the de- ;
vice is to be constructed. This is the
specification which accompanies the
Board of Agriculture's mandate:
The harness must be made of canary
colored hide.
It must be lined with red felt, pinked
at edge and stitched throughout with
yellow thread.
There- must be a girth strap, two
shoulder straps, chest strap, â¢ martin
gale and saddle. '
The girth strap shall be fastened by
means of staples and ratchet plates, ,
the staple to turn freely and to have
a small hole to admit of the string of
official leaden seal.
The staple plates and side loops must
be made of aluminum.
The plate on the saddle is to bear the
following words, deeply engraved, and
filled with black lac:
BOARD OF AGRICULTURE
FIST! FRIES
IN QUARANTINE
FOR RABIES.
I. D. NO
These directions must be strictly ad
hered to. No latitude is allowed for
the display of individual taste. The
substitution of yellow felt for red felt,
or red thread for yellow thread, w-ill
constitute a violation of the law which
may be sternly dealt with. It would
seem that the British Board of Agri
culture has discovered some intimate,
though occult, connection between can
ary-colored hide, red felt and yellow i
thread 'and the suppression of rabies. I
The cost of the harness will be $3 75
and UDward, according to the size re
quired.
When a dog lands it must be sub
jected to an examination by a veter
inary surgeon appointed by the board.
Whether or no the animal shows any
signs of rabies makes no difference.
After pocketing his fee he will proceed
to invest it with the weird arrange
ment of straps, buckles, ratchet plates,
martingale and saddle, and affix the
Board of Agriculture's seal, which it
will be a punishable misdemeanor for
any one but the authorized official to
break. And for six months thereafter,
sleeping or waking, in the privacy of
its owner's back yard or curled up on
its mistress' lap, the dog must wear
that harness with the accompanying
quarantine badge. And in addition, for
the same period, it will not be allowed
on a public thoroughfare without be
ing muzzled.

5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. May 27. â Jules
Verne and H. G. Wells will have to
look to their laurels if Jean Delalre
can keep on evolving plots as uncom
mon as that of his new novel. "Around
a Distant Star." Mr. Delaire. who is
of French extraction, has published, if
one remembers rightly, three other
stories, but this is his first attempt at
fantastic fiction. Its hero has been
profoundly impressed by discovering
ihat the expanse which separates the
earth from the nearest of the fixed
ptars is so great that light from them
traveling at the rate of 180,000 miles
a second takes over three years to
reach us; that, in fact, we do not see
a star as it is now, but as it was three
years ago. Hence, if we happened to
be on the planet in question and look
ing at the world with a strong enough
glass we should see three-year-old
events in the act of happening. Go
ing- on, he decides that if we were
transported to one of the more distant
of the heavenly bodies with a speed
greatly exceeding the light we should
be able to see carried on before our
eyes scenes that occurred on the earth
hundreds of years ago. Now it hap
pens that Mr. Delaire's ingenious hero
doubts gravely the truth of the Gospel.
He figures, however, that, could be get
on a sufficiently distant star with a
speed exceeding that of light he could,
given a telescope some million times
more powerful than existing Instru
ments, see what went on in Palestine
1900 years ago. These are pretty big
"ifs," but the hero of "Around a Dis
tant Star" eventually surmounts them,
and. In company with a valiant friend,
he encases himself in a projectile,
Â¦which also carries his wonderful tele-
Bcope. and so effectually beats light to
the planet that he arrives. just in time
to watch on earth the events of Pas
eioh Week and thus convince himself,

truth of the Gospel stories.
American visitors to Stratford-on-

have failed to take a look a^ the house
in High street where dwells Miss
Marie Corel!!. Hereafter they will
have all the more reason to do so, for
the authoress has just spent $1000 in
having her residence, which dates
back to a time before the discovery
of America, restored to its original
condition. In 1459 the house was in
habited by one John Hannys, who held
the proud position of master of the
Guild of the Holy Cross, and other
illustrious Stratford folk lived in it
afterward. For a good many years,
however, the most striking part of the
ancient architecture of the- house has
been hidden behind a modern front-
It is this which Miss Corelli has had
removed and now the original black
and white timbers can be seen. They
form designs of the bell, diamond and
Ptax, while the so-called story posts
are carved with grotesques and with
the York and Lancaster roses.

aged about 11 years. His father and
mother live in Arkansas; his grand
father and grandmother live in Los
Angeles. The old, folks thought it
would be real nice to have Willie come
out here and spend a few months with
them, so they sent for him. Willie ar
rived in due time, properly tagged, and
he delighted the hearts of the old folks
by his brightness and cheerfulness. All
went well for about six weeks, when
grandpa and grandma .noticed that
Willie was not apparently enjoying
himself as much, as he did during the
first weeks after his arrival. Â¦ They
said nothing to him, however, believ

would soon get over it. '
But Willie did not regain his cheer

The old people searched high and low
for him without success and finally re
ported the disappearance to the police.
So one day a week later when Willie
stepped out of a freight car at the
Oakland mole he was promptly grabbed
by a police officer. He appeared before
Judge Murasky during a session of the

was acquainted with the boy's his

â¢ "Pretty well, sir," said the boy.
"You think Arkansas is a pretty nice
State, don't you?" said the Judge.
"Yes, sir," replied the boy, "and I am
going back there."
"That's very fine," the Judge replied.
"How do you expect to travel?"
"Freight, sir," was Willie's reply. "I
came up from Los Angeles in three
days."
"Well, well," was the jnext remark
of the Judge, followed by the query:
"Don't you think you would like to
stay in San Francisco for a little
while?"

THE Wall Street Journal, the organ of the great
financial combines, in an estimate of election re
sults predicts the defeat of President Roosevelt,
because New York will vote against him. After as
scribing other reasons, including the power of Tammany,
the Journal says: "Moreover this State is the headquar
ters of those great financial interests which are opposed
to President Roosevelt on account of his action in the
Northern Securities case and the anthracite coal strike."
Perhaps it is true that the alliance between the Demo
cracy and the trusts is strong enough to make an im
pression on the vote of New York.
Iu 1900 McKinley and Roosevelt carried 29 States
with 296 electoral votes, and Bryan carried 16 with 151
electoral votes. To be elected now President Roosevelt
must carry 224 electoral votes. McKinley carried Cali
fornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indi
ana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Penn
sylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont,
Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
Give Maryland; West Virginia and New York to the
Democratic-trust alliance and add to it Byran's votes in
1900 and the trust candidate will have only^203 electoral
votes to Roosevelt's 244.
While no one concedes- New York to the trusts
Roosevelt can be elected without it. The reason given
by those who hope to take his own State from him is
the reason that will give- him 244 electoral votes in
States that are not only naturally as Republican a3 Ore
gon, but in which the people are not lost in admiration
of the kind of high finance of which Wall itreet has been
the center for the last three years. These voters have no
prejudice against financiers nor the fair and lawful use
of wealth. But they object to such operations as have
characterized many of the combinations which have
lured the public to invest in securities that had no as
sets or insufficient assets behind them. The industrial
combinations which have created new wealth by the ex
pansion of production and economy of processes are en
titled to their share of what they create, and the public
who bought their stocks are fairly entitled to the divi
dends.
We see no evidence that such organizations have any
grudge against the President. But (the other sort th*at
use combination to take unfair advantage- of investors
and make their profits by promoting the sale of unsup
ported securities naturally oppose him and he expects
them to do so. His course in the Northern Securities
case, while it brings upon him the wrath of Mr. J. J.
Hill, has-been affirmed by the Supreme Court of the
United States. No good citizen, no one fit to have a
voice in the election of a President, can find any fault
with an action which is backed by that court and demon
strated to be only an enforcement of the law of the land.
The President has laid it down *as the rule of his ad
ministration that no man is above the law and no man
is below it. All must obey it. This rule he has rigidly
and bravely enforced, and it will be a sorry day for the
republic when a President is -defeated by asserting the
principle that some men may be above the law and'Some
below it.
Personally Mr. J. J. Hill is probably a very estimable
man, but even he has no virtues which entitle him to be
held above the law. The man on horseback comes only
when a free government finds it impossible to protect
life and property by enforcing its laws. When such a
situation as the existing lawlessness in Colorado and the
rights claimed by Mr. Hill becomes general then 'men
have no protection against assassination from one side
and spoliation from the other. The law leaves their
lives and property defenseless, and the man on horse
back comes to enforce, by arbitrary power, rights that
had no protection by the law.'
We do not hesitate to say that the defeat of the Presi
dent for the reasons given by the Wall Street Journal
would be the beginning of the end in this country. The
issue presented is not partisan. It is the issue involv
ing the survival of civil liberty.
If the voters can be lured into rebuking a President
for being mindful of his great oath and enforcing the
law against all who violate it it will be a vote of want of
confidence in free institutions. In that aspect the cam
paign is more threatening than anything in our history,
eten than the Civil War. In that great struggle it is
our habit to believe that civil liberty would have been
preserved, even in a divided country, by perpetuating the
institutions upon which freedom depends. But for the
people of the whole Union, of the united country, to
rise up and say that they will, hot have a President who
enforces the law is a deliberate act of suicide, the hara
kiri of a republic. Â¦
In the face of such an issue all old party differences
disappear. Questions of finance and tariff are retired to
tKe rear, and the only question to be decided is, Are any
men to be declared above the law or below 'it? It is a
stupendous issue and the President is to be the objective
of this sinister attack. He becomes the representative
of the lawful rights of his countrymen and stands for
something greater than the policies of a party, for he
represents the essential principles of a free, society
ruled by law. , â¢.

Judge Mogan heard the story of the
song yesterday morning and decreed a
fine of $10 each on the singers.
K. R. Murai and T. Skomi, two Jap
anese, were sir.gtag the wild songs of
their dear native land at 2 o'clock yes
terday morning at the corner of Broad
way and Dupont street. One of the se
lections was a battle song of the Sa
muri and the noise the singers made
pounded like a waiter falling down an
elevator shaft with a tray of dishes.
Policeman Lambert was attracted by
the weird disturbance and instructed
the Jars to cut out the rough work and
seek their-' boudoirs. Disdaining the
warning, the sinsers fell into an em
brace and continued their cantatory ef
forts in a more impassioned key. Then
a blue wagron drove up and the Japs,
still j?:nping. were given a ride to the
City Prison.
Judge Fritz rather sided with John
ton's contention and excused more
than half of the panel. He then Issued
a eiH;clal venire for fifty more tales
men, returnable this morning, and In
structed the bailiff to invade the
w holesale districts and secure a venire
of men whose sporting blood has been
somewhat subdued by the cold science
of commercialism.
Most of the distinguished talesmen
had excuses for not serving on the
Jury, so Judge Fritz dismissed them.
Attorney Johnson volleyed and thun
dered against the make-up of the
panel, characterizing it as a Job to ac
quit a man who had deliberately sto
len a larpe turn of money.
The first three names drawn from the
box were Harry Corbett, Tim McGrath
and Eddy Graney. Closely following
came Jack McNamara, Gus Hagedorn
and & host cf other saloon- keepers and
well-known Ei>orting men. The list
read like a W. C. T. U. roll call of
Those not accounted for. Many mem
.jvrs of the panel were excused. Harry
Corbett said that if he was compelled
to serve there would be nobody ieft to
close the Golden Gate after nightfall.
McGrath asserted that if he were de
;ained on Jury duty Jack Munroe, the
heavy-weight pugilist who is to fight
Jeffries on June 17. would wither up
like a bunch of roses and it would be
necessary to take him to the ringside in
an ambulance.
Johnson is special prosecutor against
Sproat, whom the Merchants' 'Associa
tion Is prosecuting relentlessly. He
formerly had a market at Market and
I'.Ieventh streets, in partnership with
his brother, and it is alleged that the
firm sequestered more than $40,000 from
the sale of goods that they had obtain
ed on credit. Sproat demanded a Jury
trial and was granted it. A special
venire waa issued and returned yester
day afternoon.
With a vigor that danced the tables
and caused the empty chairs in Judge
Fritz's court room to jump up and
down. Attorney Hiram Johnson yester
day denounced the panel summoned to
try C. 8. Sproat on a charge of con
cealing personal property in order to
defraud his creditors.
A Jury in Judge Fritz's court yester
day acquitted F. H. Wells, a union sta
bleman, of the charge of assault on
Robert Hutchins. a non-union man em
ployed at thi> Stanford stables. Hutch
ins was knocked down and beaten on
Monday night while on his way from
the Stanford stables to his lodgings.
His Identification of Weils was uncer
tain and the defendant had several
â¢witnesses to prove an alibi.
Valentine Ballarato, while driving an
express wagon Tuesday on Dupont
street, knocked down Ah Sid, an eight
year-old Chinese boy. The lad escaped
without perious injury, but the driver
was arrested for battery. He was be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday, but the
father of the boy refused to prosecute
and Ballarato was given his freedom.
Nicholas George and Marie Angelo,
two gypsies with an accumulation of
dirt on their faces that was phenome-
nal even for that tribe, appeared be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday, charged
with stealing a horse. They had bar
gained with C. C. Philling *Â«- the pur

wheezy nag, for which the-v pâ â¢ - - 3 to
pay J5 50. They got the horse, but
failed to come through with the coin,
and when the owner went after his
steed it was missing. Probably the
gypsies had eaten it.
They promised to leave for Arizona
to-day and were dismissed.
Nathan Cohn, a character on the
water front, and more familiarly
known as "Domo Domo," was before
Judge Mogan yesterday and was found
guilty of disturbing the peace. He will
be sentenced to-day. "Domo Domo"
was annoying an aged peanut vendor
named Dicky Doyle and the latter
threatened to call a policeman- s. Â¦
"Call him," said Domo, "I can lick
the entire police force of San Francis
co."
Just then Policeman O'Callaghan
came along and heard the remark.
"Do you know how many policemen
there are in San Francisco?" he asked.
"About six hundred, I guess," said
Domo.
"And how many are there of you?"
"One." said Domo.
"Then come with me, you foolish
man." said the policeman, and Domo
went.
Charles F. T^erge, the drug clerk who
made a slight mistake by giving John
McCann a slug of carbolic acid instead
of a dese of medicine for dyspepsia,
was arraigned before Judge Mogan
yesterday on the charge of manslaugh
ter and his hearing was continued un
til June 13.
W. S. Warfield has been having a
perfectly delightful time running a lot
tery in the Crossley building. He was
charged with the offense before Judge
Mogan yesterday and fined $100, which
he pungled readily.
Charles Reynolds thought he saw a
good thing coming his way when he
stopped Henry Travis on Third street
one misty morning a week or so ago.
Under the suasion of a cocked revol
ver Travis stuck his hand3 as far into
the sky as he could reach and Rey
nolds went through him. He found only
15 cents and was disgusted. While he
was expending the third nickel for a
steam beer a policeman entered the
saloon with Travis and after a positive
identification took Reynolds to jail.
Judge Fritz yesterday held Reynolds
to answer to the Superior Court for
robbery.
Fred Pierce, the elderly gentleman
who has been in the habit of stealing
plugs from standpipes on buildings and
disposing of them to Junk dealers as
old brass, was bound over yesterday to
the Superior Court by Judge Fritz, in
bonds of $2000. The charge is petty lar
ceny, but there is a prior conviction for
the same offense. About a year ago he
made a splendid collection of lead pipe,
but wearying of it he sold it. The po
lice found out about the transaction
and Pierce sDent three months in re
tirement at the Branch County JaJL
"William Johnson, who makes a prac
tice of relieving delivery wagons of
parcels while the drivers are making
goo-goo eyes at the servants in the
houses where they deliver goods, was
found guilty of three charges of petty
larceny yesterday and sentenced to six
months in the County Jail by Judge
Cabaniss. Johnson hypothecated his
plunder for booze and life was one
long, sweet dream to him until he
stumbled into the rAeshes of the law.
He was convicted on three charges and
sentenced to six months on each, but
the sentences run concurrently.
Anderson was before Superior Judge
Lawlcr some months ago and was con
victed of burglary. Owing to his
youth he was allowed his freedom on
probation.
At his hearing yesterday he blub
beredi and asked to be allowed to go
home to his mamma, but Judge Ca
baniss thought that sixty days in the
County Jail would be better than the
home influence.
George Anderson, a seventeen-year
old boy, who lives with his parents in
the Mission, is engaged in carrying on
a desperate flirtation with the yawning
pates of the penitentiary. He was be
fore Judge Cabaniss yesterday on a
charge of carrying concealed weapons.
He was picked up by a policeman at
Twer.ty-third and Howard streets
shortly after midnight yesterday. He
could give no reasonable excuse for be
ing In this lonei*- place at tb->Â» hour.
When he was taken into custody a for
midable revolver, almost as heavy as
himself, was found tucked away in his
clothes.
A mother's tears and pleadin&s yes
terday saved Charles Kunre from a
term in the penitentiary. The accused
was charged with breaking into a
freight car of the Southern Pacific
Company and stealing a quantity of
rubber hose. The charge against him
was burglary and the proof was posi
tive. Judge Fritz heard the case.
Mrs. Kunze was neatly dressed, and
even in her distress showed signs of re
finement and dig-nity. Leaning against
the Judge's bench she sobbed and
pleaded for her boy, beseeching the
Judge to save him from a felon's fate.
Touched by the mother's grief, and
with the consent of Prosecuting Attor

petty larceny and a sentence of six
months in the County Jail was. im

DEXMAR SELECTION'S.
It is evident Jeffries has endeavored
to prepare himself for a sharp, decisive
contest, so that he can. If victorious, be
in a position to retire gracefully from
the ring if he so desires. There are no
more challengers for his tltTe on the
horizon and were he to be out of the
ring for a year or more training would
then be an Irksome task. He has a
goodly share of the world's goods and
his earning capacity as a theatrical at
traction will not wane for some time to
come. Â¦
Whatever the outcome of the fight
between Jeffries and Munroe in Me
chanics' Pavilion one wee., from to
night may be, it is the consensus of
opinion among the boxing enthusiasts
that Munroe is the legitimate successor
to the title when the reign of King Jeff
is ended, either by choice or by neces
sity.
There is no way to figure Munroe a
winner of this fight on public form,
but he clearly outclasses every known
aspirant for the title, a sorry array of
broken down athletes at best. Here is
the list: Fitzsimmons, Corbett. Shar
key, Ruhlin, Jack Johnson, McVey.
McCoy, Gardner, Jeffords, Maher. Fer
guson, Russell and throw in Berger
and Hodenbach for good measure.
Munroe is two years younger than
Jeffries and his friends claim he haa
shown such aptitude for boxing during
the past few weeks that they will soon
be prepared to make extravagant
claims for him. He is thoroughly
game and has size and strength in
keeping with the title to which he as
pires.
This sort of diversion seems to be his
special delight, anfl he lets the ponder
ous ball strike him on the stomach and
chest and never seems to feel the ef
fect of the blows. He finished the day's
work by taking a plunge in the ocean.
When he faced the dinner table he dis
posed of everything In sight like a true
champion.
. Munroe and Jeffries had a mutual
agreement In New York to accept
Eddie Graney as .referee, but nothing
was said about this in the articles
when they were drawn/ up. Munroe is
not worrying about the! referee ques
tion, so it seems to be all up to his
manager, Harry Pollock.
One of the. first bets made on the
fight shows how wide is the difference
of opinion as to the ability of the rival
gladiators. A well known sporting
man has wagered $100 at even money
that Jeffries will not win In ten rounds.
From all accounts Jeffries would like
a little of this. '
Besides going roughly with Galla
gher, Munroe went several fast rounds
with Ivan McLaughlin and Olin and
Jack Sullivan and did aome shadow
boxing with Frank Rafael, the light
weight. Olin Sullivan nit the miner
rather low In one of these mixups. It
did not seem to bother him in the least,
but he smilingly cautioned his spar
ring partner to be more careful.
When Jack had finished his work
with the gloves the gym was cleared of
all the spectaors and tha big fellow
commenced to pull the various ap
paratus about. He tugged at the chest
weights, punched the two bags and
worked the wrist machines." Then to
wind up the work in the gym, he threw
the medicine ball with Andy Gallagher
for several minutes.
He was fast on his feet and "his Wind
was exceptionaliy good, for during the
afternoon's work he never breathed
hard. once. He was cool at. all times
and always ready to take advantage
of an opening during the mixups at
short range. He displayed great skill
in blocking all the blows Gallagher sent
in and few of them took effect.
Jack Munroe tried the infighting
game yesterday for thÂ« first time sine*
he began training and the way he
went after Andy Gallagher made the
spectators look at one another in open
eyed astonishment. He was as rough
as a bear and as hard to hit as a clever
bantam. He displayed great strength
and if he can only do a little of this
kind of work in the coming fight, lively
doings may be looked for.
The miner and Gallagher 'started it
hot and heavy and went into a clinch
right away. Then they wrestled and
tussled about and tugged at each other
for several minutes. Munroe landed
some stiff short arm jolts auring these
mixups and Andy often winced when
he felt the force of the husky miner's
blows.

Munroe Tries Infighting and
Hustles Andy Gallagher
About in Lively Manner.
Much to their gratification neither
Jack Jeffries nor Joe Kennedy were
called upon this morning to don the
jnlts. Jeffries confined his exercising
to the usual routine gymnasium work,
bag punching, rope skipping, the
pulleys and tugging with his favorite,
the big jumbo sand bag. Resting dur
ing the afternoon hours he went for a
three-mile run down the Middletown
road after the dinner hour, a - new
etunt- He returned dripping with
perspiration, but retired at once to the
rymnasium, where he again did some
light work witih the apparatus and
appeared to be not the least fatigued.
"With his sharp eyes, ever alert look
ing for something to kill, Jeff stopped
to dispatch a poisonous specie, of the
lizard family on the Jog home. On the
Â¦nay up the hill to the springs the
champion said: "See that belt? When
I came up here the first hole was the
right number. Now when I cinch it
up to the eighth hole it's too loose."
It took long, tiresome runs on the road
to accomplish that. Jeff retired soon
after his rub down.
Manager Billy Delaney thinks Eddie
Graney will ultimately prove satisfac
tory to all concerned and will referee
the contest. "When the match was
made in New York*" said Delaney to
day, "I submitted five names to Harry
Pollock and he selected that of Graney.
If Pollock is disgruntled over the little
blacksmith's decision in the Corbet t-
Biitt fight he has failed to notify me
of the fact and I think Graney will
officiate. At any rate, he Is perfectly
"No." he replied, "I feel strong and
fine. VÂ»"hen I feel that my strength
has left me in training, that's the
lime I'll quit fighting."
If It should transpire that the com
ing battle with Jack Munroe should
mark the farewell appearance in the
ring of the greatest of modern pugil
ists â and such may prove the cas*Â» â
spectators will nee an athlete trained
to the hour when he crawls through
the ropes. No attention should be paid
to the rumors nvhich ( have emanated
from different sources to the effect
that he has neglected his training.
They are false, and may have been cir
culated to influence the betting.
Quite the contrary, Jeff has worked
harder for this contest than he did
Trhea training to meet Corbett a year
ago. He apparently realizes that, while
not meeting an opponent skilled in the
art of boxing. Jack Munroe combines
in his maice-up a generous supply of
"bone and sinew, and that two or three
rounds of fast infighting and wrestling
might place him hors de combat if not
ready and fit. Munroe will enter the
ring weighing almost as much as di<l
Qua Ruhlin when the Akron giant met
the champion.
This Is a fast age and people seek
for and desire quick action for their
money If inclined to gamble. Not un-
Ukevtf5rse racing, In the mad scramble
Cor dollars, all sentiment has departed
from the boxing game. Sullivan
earned everlasting popularity because
be tanned his opponents to sleep in a
round or two. Terry McGovern, a
miniature edition of the mighty John
L, became a public idol by sending
spectators home early. Jeffries is a
big man and the admirers of pugil
ism expect big things of him. In the
past he has failed to establish the
reputation of being a knocker-out.
Be should have whipped both Fitz
Â¦lmmons and Corbett in short order,
eay Inside of four rounds, but owing
to untoward clcumstances he did not
iflo the trick. He is apt to exhibit
more speed though in the coming go.
HARBIN SPRINGS. June 9âCham
pion Jim Jeffries believes in testing his
powers of skill and endurance while in
training. After his work in the gym
this morning and while he was_jÂ»Iow
ing out, some one asked him if he
was not afraid of overdoing it, so
fast and eteady does the big boiler
maker toil.

Ganley saved the game for Oakland
in the seventh. Irwin had doubled to
center and Tonwsend produced a long
fly to right. Irwin started for third,
but Ganley winged him out to one of
the greatest throws of the season.-
Miller also did some magnificent work
at short, while Dexereaux robbed the
"Rabbit" of a clean hit over third in
the eighth. Many tried to score on
Jimmy Byrnes, but the kid winged
'em all out on perfect throws to the
second bag. The score:
The score was 1 to 0 when the home
clouters came up for their final wal
lop at the leather. WaWron had
nothing but a pop fly, but Pat Meany
sneaked in a hit over third. Irwin
produced a soft one that netted him
naught and made the admirers of the
Harris aggregation groan, for it looked
dubious.
Cy Townsend's bat caught . the
leather right underneath and away it
went out against the center field
fence. Dunleavy was right under it,
but unfortunately he stumbled. He
recovered again and made another
try. Again his feet became entangled
In some 6t the rocks and he slipped
for a second time Just as he had his
mitts on the ball, but it escaped him.
The' roar from a thousand throats
was deafening as Meany turned third
base and dashed for the plate. Dun
leavy picked up the ball in a twink
ling and lined it to the plate. Meany
slld under it by a nose and San Fran
cisco nad its only run â made after
two were gone in the last inning of
play.
Oakland came up for a dying stand.
Graham struck at two and then. bing.
out to right field went the ball and
Graham landed on second. Ganley
next took holQ of the club and twice
he tried to bunt, but failed. *As a last
resort he swung squarely on a fast
one. It skipped over second base and
then Graham ltrmbered across the
plate with the one that counted most.
It was Dunleavy who scored the
other run for Oakland in the second
inning when he doubled to the' center
field fence, went to third on Dever
eaux's out. second to first, and ar
rived when Moskimaa died the same
way. w
The finish of the game at Recrea
tion Park yesterday was a fitting
windup of. a baseball battle that had
everything in it to thrill the multitude
and make the life of the fan worth
living. The strife was broken up by
Bobby. Ganley and Oscar Graham in
Hie final spasm, after San Francisco
eased her only run through with two
down. ' Score, Oakland 2, San Fran

Patsy King made a killing on the
opening race of the day. He backed
Poseur, which opened at 15 to 1, and
went as high as 30 to 1, down to .8
to 1. Poseur got the best of the start
and was never headed. She won easily
by a length from Alma Dufour, the
11 to 5 favorite. It was said that King
cleared up $20,000 on Poseur's victory.
J. Gray and M. Fister. owners of
Poseur, were suspended indefinitely
with their stable, consisting of Poseur
and Gus Heidorn, after the first race.
The stable raced as J. Gray & Co. The
suspension was made pending an in
vestigation of the race. Poseur's last
two races were very bad. The track'
was about as fast as it will get at
this, meeting and the weather was su

CHICAGO^ June 9.â Gregor K, eon
sidefed one of the most consistent per
formers on the track, made a good
field look cheap in the second race to
day at Harlem. He was second choice
in the betting at 'the royal price of
8 to 5, backed from 3 to 5. Robbins
laid close, up to the pacemaker until
turning for home, where he went to the
front and won going. away vrith two
lengths to spare. Talpa, the even
money favorite, made a game bid in
the final quarter,, but was no match
for Hedges' gelding.
Monsieur Beaucaire, at 4 to 1, won
the feature event of the card, a han
dicap at a mile and twenty yards,
after an unusual incident. While the
field lined up. at the barrier the web
bing was sprung accidentally. Most
of the jockeys thought it was a start
and the entire field went on. Glassful
was the first to- pull up and then, his
Jockey also thinking it wan 'a start,
went after his field and ran the full
mile. The Regent also circled the
track before he could be pulled up.
Colonial Girl and Monsieur Beaucairs
were pulled up after going about three
furlongs. Judge Hamilton held a con
sultation with Starter McKnight, who
said the barrier had been released by
a strong wind and that he called to
the boys to pull up. Accordingly the
tie-Id Wtis sent back to the starting
point and the race was run over. Mon
sieur Beaucaire won the race.

BT. LOUIS, June 9. â Secret iervica
officers to-day nipped an attempt by
counterfeiters to mulct the Delmar
betting: ring: of thousands of dollar*.
Officer J. B. Murphy of the Federal
department arrested two men. who re
fused to give their names. They of
fered $100 gold certificates to the
books and received change. The sus
pects were searched and 150 other bo
gus notes of $100 each were found
upon them. The bills were excellent
imitations. The department had been
advised that the men had left Buffalo,
where they had been operating, for
St. Louis. They bet $50 on the win
ning favorites in the first and second
races. They were taken as they were
cashing the ticket on Wissendene. It
is believed confederate* are operating
in different parts of the country with
the same scheme.

GRAVESEND, June 9.â It is not
often three odds-on favorites are beat
en In one day's racing, but this is what
happened to-day. Two of these beaten
favorites came from the stable of E.
R. Thomas. The third was Veto, wear
ing the colors of James R. Keene. A
strict scrutiny of the record of Young
Henry this season shows he has entire
ly lost his fondness for mud, which so
distinguished him last season. His per
formance to-day waa worse than any
one had reason to expect. He broka
slowly and did not show a particle of
s,peed, trailing the bunch all the way.
Duke of Kendal, the second odds-on
favorite to lose. Is a sulker. Himself
set such a hot pace that the Duke
could not be induced to show his best
form. In the last race 1 to 3 was of
fered and accepted on Veto. He beat
everything that had shown -anything
like form, but John. E. Madden's Doro
thy Gray developed unexpected speed
and fairly flew to the finish. Dorothy
Gray was a 20 to 1 shot. Summaries:

The work of discharging the Pa
cific Mail Company's freighter Algoa
is proving an operation of great dif-.
flculty owing to the fact that the wet
ting of the cargo has caused it to
swell. The "result of this swelling has
been to jam together the freight in
the lowethold until it has become one
solid chunk of merchandise. Each bale
and box has to be pried out with crow
bars, assisted by all sorts of tackle
and in many cases, as soon as re
leased, the package has burst apart
with a loud report and scattered its
contents in every direction.
In addition to increasing the labor
of unloading, this unexpected expan
sion will add materially to the ex
tent of the damage to the cargo. No
attempt will be made to estimate this
until air the freight is on the wharf.
It probably will be much greater than
at first exoected. ,
Stevedores worked all night Wednes
day and last night loading the Siberia,
which will sail Saturday for the Ori
ent with a full cargo. The work of
discharging the Coptic has not been
commenced.

The witnesB, reverting to the subject
of Engineer Sulivan, said that Mr. Sul
livan was notdrunk, but was under the
Influence of liquor. "He knew what he
was doing and talked Intelligently, but
showed liquor," added the witness.
Captain Bolles asked: "If you had
stopped tbe ship when Taylor gave you
that four-point bearing would. the ship
have been all right?"
"Yes, sir," replied Captain Irvine.
"I don't believe I did," replied Cap
tain Irvine. "I am not prepared to say
that I did or I did not." \ .
Irvine â Yee.
In reply to a question by First Mate
Wilson, Captain Irvine said that durr
Ing the two years that Wilson had been
on board the shi;? Wilson had never
been under the influence of liquor.
In answer to a question by Captain
Bulger, Captain Irvine said that the
person who gave the order to supply
the liquor to the officers was directly
responsible for violating a positive rule
of the company.
"Did you- make a statement," asked
Engineer Sullivan, "to me that you
alone were responsible for the wreck
of the Colon?" "â¢;
BULGES WANTS TO KNOW.
Captain Bulger took the case and
was anxious to know some things. The
substance of some important questions
and answers follow:
Dy Bulgerâ If you had no confidence In the
mate, wljj aid you allow him on the bridge?
Irvine â I had confidence in the man but
I thought he was nilntaken In his bearings.
Bulgerâ Should nut an offlcvr be able to take
a four-point boariug correctly?
Captain Irvineâ I knew that he drank a glass
or wine at dinner, but I didn't think the ef
fects would last so iong.
Captain Bowles was stern in his re
ply to the statement of Captain Irvine.
He said:
It wemn to me Fingular, captain, that an old
coaster as you have been up and down this
ci ut for years and years, would take no notice
cf a report that the ship was cloÂ»Â»r to the

vtma voyages rhowc that the fhlp averaged

Question by Captain Bo!1eÂ« â Knowing, as
yni 5jv you did. that Sullivan was under the
influence of liquor, didn't It strike you when
ycu received Taylor's report that the report
micht be correct?
Anrwerâ Because I didn't believe that it was
rÂ°SMh:e for th? vessel to be where Taylor re
ported.
Qutsiirm by Captain Bolles â After Taylor
ha<1 made his rej.ort. why didn't you steer oft

The inspectors then took Captain Ir
vine in hand and ask^d .him why he
had not acted upon the information
given him-by Third Mate Taylor. The
captain replied:
I didn't havr iÂ«y confidence in Mr. Taylor's
report as to hi* h^artnus. I thought he was

ASSISTANT ENGINEER ASLEEP.
Mate' Taylor testified further that
when he went into the engine-room to
inform the engineer that they were five
miles off. shore he found Second As
sistant Engineer John Campbell asleep
in the chair and was obliged to shake
him to awaken him.
Mr?. Wilson testified yesterday be
fore the inspectors. Â£he told of going
to the storekeeper's room with her
husband and of their remaining only
long enough to drink a small glass of
Champagne. The eight officers were
merry, she Faid, but not at all under
the influence of liquor.
J. W. Taylor, the third mate, said
that he oould not remember whether
he conveyed an order to Chief Engineer
Sullivan to make fifty-four revolutions
per minute, or whether it was that
Sullivan told him that the ship was
making that many revolutions. Shortly
before the ship struck the Remedios
r^ef Taylor reported to the captain
that his calculation of the bearings lo
cated the ship four miles from shore,
but the captain and Second Mate
Thompson disagreed with him and in
sisted that they were seven miles off
shore. The captain ordered the witness
to call him should they get closer to
the shore.
Durinp: the noon recess Stevens said
that thirty quart, bottles of champagne
and three quarts of whisky were con
sumed by eight men from 9 o'clock on
Saturday evening, April 9, until 5
oV-lock tin Sunday morning.
This was. all in honor of the wed
ding of First Mate J. L. Wilson to
one of the lady passengers. She was
the widow of an artist named Schmitz
who lived on Van Xess avenue. The
lady was on the way to Germany when
she became fascinated by Mate Wilson,
and bestowed her hand â a small one â
end her purseâa large one â upon the
gallant officer.
Testimony favorable to Chief En
gineer W. D. E. Sullivan of the
wrecked steamship Colon was elicited
yesterday at the investigation held by
I'nitf-d states Local ' Inspectors O. F.
Bolles and John K. Bulger which
Kuded to show that a despicable trick,

ties and they permKted the effects of

But the event did not end without
an eviction after all. To relieve his
overwrought feelings. Wo Mey seized
his qoundam lieutenant, Ah Ping, and
bodily hustled him to the street. Th*-n
the heathen Chinee returned to hla
quarters, rearranged hia effects an>i
prepared to calm his wounded feelings
with the aid of the "black smoke."
While Galland and Gallagher were
levying on the furniture Wo Mey ap
peared and paid down the sum of $260
to cover the amount of the Judgment
and costs of execution.
WO MEY PAYS IP.
Passing into a next room at the
back of the house, the deputies found
a trapdoor, planned for hastily dispos
ing of the gambling equipment In case
of surprise. Underneath this was a re
ceptacle for the same and an .exit
through an adjoining building.
At first Ah Ping seemed very much
perturbed and asked permission to
clear out the room. Inquiry revealed
the fact that the firm of Fang Hins
On Kee had disappeared, leaving Ah
Ping in charge to face the officers. An
other Chinaman, Wo Mey, Is also In
terested In the company. A search
through the disordered premises up
stairs failed to reveal any other gamb
ling devices. The Sheriff will turn thtf
lottery property over to the police.
TRAPDOOR WAS HANDY.
Tbe officers found the company's
door barricaded. Receiving no answer
from within, they broke down the door
and discovered that the store, ostensi
bly used for the sale of merchandise,
was vacant. After passing through a
short hall they came upon another
door likewise barricaded. On their de
manding an entrance and knocking
several times the door was opened by
Ah Ping, who had been left in charge.
Upon entering the room the deputy
sheriffs discovered that they were In
a complete and active Chinese gamb
ling joint. The doors on both sides of
the room were solid and fitted with
heavy locks. Tickets in the various
lotteries were pasted upon the walls.
The table, which extended across onÂ«
side of the room, was littered with lot
tery tickets, rubber stamps and other
gambling paraphernalia. The drawers
under the table were filled with unused
tickets and with aprons containing
p6c.ket3 used for peddling the tickets.
There was very little money in the
drawers.
A Chinese lottery, with gambling:
equipment, was accidentally discover
ed yesterday morning when Deputy
Sheriffs . Galland and Gallagher levied
an attachment for arrears In rent. Fire
Commissioner J. G. Boyne obtained
judgment for rent against the Fang
Hmg On Kee Company of 722 Dupont
street and yesterday an attachment
fcr J245 was given to the Sheriff to
serve.
This led Commissioner Kirkpatrick
to remark that the complaint was not
that the custom of the wholesalers had
been violated, but that the Woodward
law had been transgressed. After the
complaint against Wolf & Son has been
fully heard there are other cases. These
will come up Saturday morning.
He denied that he had told Lercari
that he refused to sell because it would
violate the rules of the association. In
fact, said Burnham. there was no Pro-'
duce Dealers' Protective Asociation.
John G. Wetmore testified that there
tyas no Produce Dealers' Protective
Association; if there was another asso
ciation to which he belonged he could
not remember Its name. On the other
hand Plerretti, who was recalled, testi
fied that he (Pierretti) was formerly a
member of the Produce Dealers' Pro
tective Association and that he re
signed therefrom simultaneously with
Lercari.
At the afternoon session of the hear
ing Attorney Reinstein tried strenuous
ly to get In a lot of questions as to
whether the selling price was not de
pendent upon the quantity of onions
purchased and strove to persuade the
Commissioners that it was only a mat
ter of price that prevented Burnham
from selling fifteen sacks of onions at a
rate at which a larger lot could be
bought. i
He also asked a great variety of
questions concerning the custom of
dealers. All these questions were ob
jected to by Attorney Wise and they
were practically all barred out by
Chairman Spear of the Harbor Com
missioners.
In the afternoon Burnham was called
as a witness for the defense. He testi
fied that he is the $ales agent of Wolf
& Son on the Washington-street wharf
and that he refused to sell the onions
to Lecarl, as the latter had tetifled, but
Burnham had a different verlson oj
the conversation from the one given
by Lercari, Pierretti and Bacigalup!.
Lercari identified papers that were
handed to him by Attorney Wise
as being the rules of the Produce
Dealers' Protective Association, o[
which he was formerly a mem
ber. Rule 3 provides that not
less than fifty boxes of potatoes
and twenty-five sacks of onions shall
be sold to a purchaser. G. Pierretti and
A. Baclgalupi were present, so said
Lercari, when the conversation with
Burnham took place. They furnished
the same version of the story as Ler
cari.
BUKMIAM TELLS STORY.
â¢ Of the latter there were two hostile
camps before the Commissioners. On
one side .were those who are alleged to
be members of the Produce Dealers'
Protective Association and on the
other were somewhat more than iwen
ty produce dealers who withdrew from
the association and who asserted earn
estly that the association was trying to
cor.x them back into membership.
Charles J. Lercari testified that on
May 28, on the Washington-street
wharf, he asked Frank Burnham, sell
ing agent of Wolf & Son, the price of
onions per bag and was told by Burn
ham that he could have onions tor $1
per baft. He offered a $20 gold piece in
payment and called for fifteen bags of
thft vegetables, and Burnham then told
him it was against the rules of the
Produce Dealers' Protective Associa
tion to sell less than twenty-five sacks
of onions at a time.
On the other hand ; t was as stoutly
asserted by one witness that there is
no such association, it having gone out
of business. One witner.s supplied two
different versions of the same transac
tion in the space of five minutes.
Throughout the day the produce
dealers, of whom there were possibly
two score in attendance, took a lively
interest in the forensic efforts of
Messrs. ; Wise, attorney for the com
plainant, and -Reinstein. for- the de
fence. At times the lawyers grew quite
warm.
WITNESSES DISAGREEING.
Some of the testimony that was
taken yesttrday contradicted other tes
timony llatly. It was testified, for In
stance, that the refusal to sell bo few
as fifteen bags of onions to Lercari was
due to the rules of the Produce Denlr
ers' Protective Association.
.The transaction took place on the
Washington-street whaif. so no'ques
tion of jurisdiction on the part of the
Harbor Commissioners was raised, the
wharf being the rroperty of the State
and under the control of the Harbor
Commissioners. There was nothing for
the Commissioners to sift except the
testimony. The proceedings were not
finished when the hour to adjourn for
the day had arrived. The evidence was
all in, hut the attorneys wish to sum
up before the Commissioners decide.
By reason of this, arguments will be
heard this afUrnoon, beginning at 4
o'clock.
v -
The Harbor Commissioners devoted
several hours yesterday to finding out
what truth there is in the complaint
made by Charles J. Lercari against
Wolf & Son. The allegation made by
Lercari is that Wolf & Son refused to
sell him fifteen bags of onions at $1 per
bag.; and that this refusal constituted
discrimination and warrants thÂ« Har
bor Commissioners in taking away
from Wolf & Son their permit to sell
perishable produce on the wharf, which
he asks shall be done.
George Russell, the expert of the Po
lice Department on models and dia
grams, was next placed on the stand.
He had elabrtrate diagrams of the
Â¦warehouses at Crockett and the posi
tion a?!d number of grain sacks con
tained ir. them. Attorney Ach objected
to their admission, as explanations
were written on portions of them. On
< ro.-s-examination by Attorney Short
ridge the witness admitted Â¦ that the
diagrams were made in August. As
ih*> firm's affairs passed into the hands
of a receiver in June and there had
bÂ«-en much shifting of grain, the por
tions of the diagram relating to the lo
<-Â«tion of the various piles of sacks \vafÂ»
objected to, and the objection was
sustained. Russell then explained the
1> nation of the buildings, their internal
rit-rangement and the area covered by
them. The case will be continued to
day.
"Did you make statements to the
beads of the firm at regular intervals?"
vas asked.
"I made memoranda of the check
book.* 1 was the i*>ply.
"Did you ever make out a trial bal
ence sheet?"'
â¢No."
Regarding his books, ilitchell said
that t<r the best of his knowledge they
v ere never rigidly examined. He had
nothing to do with the grain specula
tions and made his entrif-s from a
bl< liter furnished by Mr. I^angton.
Josua Eppir.ger would occasionally look
over the books, but Jacob Eppinger
paid little attention to them.

The witness was then shown the bills
Jireperited to Cutter & Moseley for the
3'iadir.p of lets TOfi. 707, 70S and 7C9 and
the checks for $100 in payment for the
tame and Identified the handwriting on
the bill as that of one of the employes
of the firm. He also identified the
Fijrmitures and rubber stamps on the
cheek.
So far as Mitchell knew, there v. as no
Fvstetn of keeping accounts between
the warehouse at Crockett and the of
fice in this city, the business usually
l>Â«Â»irijr conducted by telephone.
The prosecution next proceeded to
?â¢r-tablish a connection Between the
lii.-ps of Eppinper & Co. and the Pa
cific Coast Warehouse Company. The
v.itnc-s stated that the officers of the
two concerns were in thv same room
itr.d the same clerkp did the work for
both. The witness knew Josua Eppin-
EÂ« â¢ as cut of the employes of the firm
but did net know whet he did to earn
his- salary. He- was of the opinion that
Jocna attended to the correspondence,
but his statement on the point was
very indefinite.
According to the testimony of Frank
is. Mitchell, who for nine yÂ«>ars was
bookkeeper for the firm of Eppinger &
Co.. the management was decidodly
lax. There was no live management,
but business simply "went alone." AI-
Thouph he had full charge of .the tom-
I>any's books, the witness knew noth
ing of the financial standing of the
firm or of the Pacific Warehouse Com
rÂ»ny. which was identical with Ep

FROM ALL^^CrFoNS THEY COME TO'
WITNESS THE WONDERFUL DEMON-
STRATIONS of tho NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
For a reliable- and intelligent clairvoyant
readins go to LIVINGSTONE, 428 Eddy at.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you ara heir to. You are acquainted
with the lactd in your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
susffest tho remedy.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression . and vivid truthfulness.
Would it not be a relief to know how you
w!ll *ueceed, to be relieved of the matters that
ar* troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call en PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
Klve you a full life reading for 11. A test
Is of little value; when the mind Is troubled
you need more substantial aid nnd advice.

Adjustable to Cut Any Site Can. Leaves No Jagged Edges.
Cuts Either Top or Side of Can. Simple to Operate. Cannot Break.
Requires No Sharpening. All Working Parts Made From Tempered Tool Steel.
'.....DIRECTIONS.....
TO OPEN CAN ON TOP. Force point of bar into center of top of unsealed or smooth end of can.
Bend over until the bar is parallel with the top of can. Set point of lower blade on top of can at whatever
distance from edge the opening is desired. Press down handle until blade penetrates the tin. Then pull
gently toward you, holding the can tightly in the other hand. (To get best result hold can by top).
TO OPEN CAN FROM SIDE. Remove label from can. Force point into exact center of top. Bend
orer until bar rests on edge of can. Set point of cutting blade against side of can. always at left of side
seam, with lever perpendicular. Press down on lever, which will force side blade into can. Hold can tiehtlv
by top with other hand and cut same as when cutting top. In cutting top off always let bottom of bar rest
and run evenly around edge of can to insure even, regular cut. If the side blade comes out while cutting, or
cuts in too far and stops, it is because you have not inserted point of bar in exact center of can. In this case
throw up lever, readjust blade and continue cutting until blade reaches opposite side of seam, when top can
be lifted or broken off altogether. Do not be afraid to grasp can firmly by the top.
THIS WAY. NOT THIS WAY
You cannot cut yourself.

passes that of the Cabin John span by
55}Â£ feet, j This summer a bridge at

"PLAYMATES"
THE NEXT FREE ART SUPPLEMENT WITH
TBE SUNDAY CALL.
Â¦
E. Louyot's "Playmates" is a scene bf home life which will appeal to all lov-
ers of children and pets. It illustrates the sympathy which exists between children
snd their animarplaymates, and suggests the charm which the ingenuous play of the
? little ones may bring into home life. It shows also that imitation of what they have
observed in the lives of their parents influences in a remarkable degree their own
actions. In putting the puppy to bed in her doll's cradle the little girl is following the
example of her mother's care for her little brother, which she has daily observed.
Although her offspring seems to be an unwilling partner to the play, the canine mother
does not seem greatly concerned, for she has doubtless been often associated with the
children in their games, and knows that they mean no harm.
The picture is one which bespeaks the artist's cheerful temperament. Into a com-
v Â¦ monplace scene he has- infused something of the sympathy which he must have .for the
homely joys of domestic life. His color also indicates a genial fondness for what is
pleasing and cheerful. It is varied and brilliant, simple and unaffected and not devoid
of refinement. There is even a certain subtlety in the placing of the blue-green and
yellow-green notes of the cupboard and the cradle together in-the picture and balanc-
ing them with a mass of the blue apro.n on the opposite side of the picture. Effects of
studied arrangement are also to be found in the judicious placing of the various notes
of red, brown and yellow.
The works of this promising young artist are not yet familiar in this country, as
there is so great a demand that thev are generally sold to collectors and dealers as soon
as they are completed, and he' has frequently so many advance orders for his pictures
that his customers have to wait many months before they can have the satisfaction of
possessing one of his interesting productions.
His models are taken from his own householdâ even the animals, which he is
â¢fond of introducing into his compositions. : His familiarity with them is unquestion-
ably the secret of his remarkable success in painting them.

NEW YORK. June 9.â The light specula
tion fir an advance in prices which was in
evicer.ee yesterday was somewhat discouraged
j to-day and gave little show of enthusiasm.
Thr poor market afforded for taking profits
yesterday afternoon served to discredit the
; ui>v.ard movement. London gave some upward
ji Impulse to prices early In tne day an-1 took
I stocks here until they reached thÂ» London
I parity, when the foreigners turned sellers again.
I London was said to be somewhat disappointed
! over the failure to reduce the discount rate
of the Bank of England. But the statement
ot the l>auk left no room for anxiety over tho
financial situation In London: The sterling
rate eaÂ»ed oft" her*, although an additional con
signment of $2.Â«J7.OW) in Japanese gold arriving
at Fan Francisco was made available to New
York bank reserves by telegraph. The result
is something like a redundancy of capital at
the great financial centers of the world, with
a corresponding apathy of speculative and even
of investment demand which seems to point
to a world-wide cause. Here In New York the
halt in the advancing tendency of prices throws
the market back into an arwthetlc condition.
There was further discussion of the strthttlr-jr
of iprG.lu<uion and consumption of iron, which
made their appearance yesterday Just before the
clote ol the stock market. The shrinkage In
conjunction in iron Is so generally accepttd
as highly significant of business conditions in
general that the discussion was bound to have
soir.e Influence on speculative sentiment. The
New York Central's slatement of May gross
earnings, showing a falling off of $:Â»2.500. or
more than 5 per cent of the previous year,
was a reminder -of an unpleasant fact In the
situation. An opinion is held that the May
statement of net earnings may show the bene
fit of measures of retrenchment not yet re
flected in any statements published. The
question of labor troubles was kept In evidence
by the . maintenance of the vessel men's
strike on the lakes, the strikes ordered of
marine firemen in the crwstwise trade and the
course of events In Colorado.
TherÂ«! was some Investment absorption of
m-ell-secured bonds, but weakness among
speculative issues made the price movement
lrrÂ«ru!ar. Total sales, par value, $1,080,000.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, June 0.â The Wheat market
showed considerable firmness at the start, due
to wet weather In sections of the Southwest
where harvesting is in progress. Firmness of
foreign markets, especially at Paris, helped to
create a bullish sentiment. OD&ning sales
were at an advance of a shade to %c at 87c to
&7@87%c. The price-soon rose to 87%*. Later
there were dispatches from Tennessee stating
that cutting of wheat had commenced and
would be 'general the beginning of the coming
week. It was intimated that the crop would
be the largest in years. With the area of
harvesting operations extending dally, wheat
traders began to realize that the. new wheat
would Boon bo coming on the market. Â¦ With
this end in view, many traders were disposed
to take. the selling side. Numerous favorable
reports as to crop prospects In general brought
out selllnc orders, from nome of the large,
holders. The Kansas State report was quite
bearish, showing the condition of. wheat June
1 to be 87, against 82 last month; Advices
from the soring whtat territory told. of con
tinued Improvement in crop conditions. Pre
dictions were Â¦Â¦ reiterated that the Government
crop^report, which Is to be issued to-morrow,
would be exceedingly bearish regarding spring
wheat. Â¦ In the face 6f these influences buying
lacked vim, . and prices steadily declined. "A
rally occurred JuÂ«t before the close on cover-'
ing by shorts, but the market still retained'an
easy- tone. After selling ott ; to 86%c - July
closed at 86%c. \ .
Wet weather had a bullish effect on the corn
market early in the day. and moderate ad
vances over yesterday's closing quotations were
realized. After selling bnween 48%c and
40%c, j u iy dosed at 48%e'49o. . .
Oats were extremely dull and held within a
narrow ranee. After-opening unchansfd to a
shade higher at 39%Â©>39Â»ic, July sold between
3U%@3l>%c and 39 %c, and, closed at 3Â»%c. j

and on buying by. packers. The impression
that a Dromlnent packer. 'was short of a big

The Supreme Court decided yester
day in the case of the Adolph Sutro
estate that the Superior Court must
proceed with the action instituted by
Theodore Schucklng o determine the
status of each rtf the 200 alleged heirs.
Emma L. Merritt, one of the daughters
of Sutro, with certain of the claim
ants, supported Schucking, and Kate
Xussbaum, another daughter, headed
the opposition.
There is no money directly involved
in the case decided, but tne decision
settles a disagreement between the at
torneys as to the proper method of
proceeding with the distribution of the
Sutro estate. The respondents argued
that Schucking had waited longer than
the law allows to file his complaint
after the trial court had issued a for
mal order that all interested parties
file claims against the estate. The
Supreme Court holds that the law on
the subject should not be construed
in too technical a manner and that
Schucking may proceed In his suit.

INSOLVENT BUTCHER.â Henry 3. Olsen. a
chicken butcher, filed a petition \n Insolvency
yeeterday In th* United States District CTUrt.
He eves $1448 and has no assets.
Jacob Barth, the stock broker, sub
mitted an affidavit showing the fluctu
ations of the stock of the Contra Costa
Water Company fcfr a number of years.
Heney read the various figures which
demonstrated that in 1899 the stork had
been quoted at from $79 to $64. but that
now it was down to $35, all of which was
due to the antagonism shown by the
Oakland Council in the matter of fix
ing rates for this year.
After a mass of figures had been
read and the present members of the
Oakland Council accused in an affi
davit of trying to ruin the company
for political reasons, the case was con
tinued until next Wednesday to enable
the attorneys to Eecure affidavits.
This morning the Spring Valley
Water Company's application, which is
a similar case.vwill be heard.
OAKLAND, June 9.â At a meeting
of the City Council this evening action
was taken authorizing the Mayor and
City Attorney to procure the affidavits
of experts employed by the Council in
gathering figures upon which it ar
rived at a valuation of the Contra
Costa Water Company's plant.
This action is made necessary by the
suit begun by the water company ask
ing for a restraining order to prevent
the Council from putting into effect
the rates adopted. The affidavits are
to' meet the figures c-ibmittcil by the
water company's experts.
The court replied that that was ex
actly the case, but the matter should
be presented in proper form.
When asked whr-sWe had taken any
part in the proceedings, Mrs. Center
said she was a stockholder in the com
pany, but now her interest had no
marketable value. ! She was undecided
whether she would take the advice of
the court regarding the filing of an
affidavit. She left the room and the
case proceeded.
During the hearing Attorney Heney
read extracts from the affidavit of L. J.
Le Conte, the well known expert enKl
neer. Mr. Le Conte estimated the value
of the company's property some time
ago and prepared a pamphlet in detail
and placed the amount at $6,455,336.
figures he did not believe would
cover the value now. as there had been
many Improvements and additional
holdings secured since he made his re
port. . *
FIGURES ARE SUBMITTED.
"Well, your Honor," she said, "I un
derstood you-to say yesterday that you
wanted all the information you could
get and I supposed this was a court of
Justice where the Injured could present
their side of the matters Involved."
JUSTICE IS DISPENSED.
There was a little surprise in the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals
yesterday during the hearing. of the
case of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany, which is seeking to restrain the
city of Oakland from putting Into ef
fect lower water rates after July 1.
While Attorney Heney was reading
certain figures on behalf of the water
company he was nudged by Mrs.
Jeanie D. Center of 2116 â¢ Bush street,
who iiiietly requested him to give way
to her for a moment. Heney acqui
esced- and the lady said: Â¦
"If it please your Honor, I would
like to address the court at this time,
as the figures which are being quoted
are not correct, for it is a fact that in
stead of the- stock being worth $35 now
it is not worth anything and has no
standing."
Judge Gilbert interrupted and said
that if she desired to make any state
ment it would be better to file an affi
davit setting forth the facts she would
like to have the court learn. /
Kelly alleges that his reputation as
a milkman and business man has been
injured and he asks for damages In
the sum of $50,000.
John Kelly, formerly a milk dealer,
yesterday filed In the Superior Cpurt
a sensational, answer to the suit of
D. A. Curtin, who seeks to recover the
sum of 51103 43 from Kelly cm . an as
signed claim from the Bay Counties
Commercial Company, which : supplied
the defendant with milk. In a counter
charge he aBks for $50,000 damages.
Kelly avers that the Bay Counties
Commercial Company has for its pur
poses ae a trust absolute restraint of
the milk trade, and has endeavored to
annoy and harass him. by the institu
tion of this action through Curtin, be-_
cause, while a milkman, he would not'
bow to and be controlled by the trust-
He alleges that the company furnished
him with milk-below the standard fixed
by the Board of v Health of San Fran
cisco and the board" declared the milk
to be dangerous and unfit for human
consumption.
At the time he entered into a con
tract with them for a nupply of milk,
Kelly avers, he was a prosperous busi
ness man, and by reason of the im
pure milk delivered by the Bay Coun
ties Commercial Company he lost his
customers and was eventually ruined.
He charges that the impure milk was
responsible for the death of the child
cf one of his customers.
Some of the strikers are getting rest
less, but they say they will avoid trou
ble and show the company they can
win without any attempts at violence.
It was rumored last night that one of
the non-union men, who does not live
at the sheds, was assaulted on his way
home.
This was incorrect. An intoxicated
man fell from the sidewalk at Fourth
and Folsom streets, cutting his scalp
so badly that when he wandered down
to the freight yards in a drunken con
dition he was sent to the hospital. He
was not employed at the sheds nor con
nected with the strikers.
The checking clerks have decided to
remain at- work, .and while they do
there is little chance of the union win
ning. Members of the union admit that,
but they say they will continue their
plans of endeavoring to persuade the
men to quit.
PROMISE NO VIOLENCE.
Union pickets patrol the outside of
the sheds and improve every chance
they get to endeavor to induce the men
at work to quit. Thus far they have
not succeeded in getting more than ten
men out of the 400 to join them. The
men who are at work appear to be sat
isfied with the treatment they are re
ceiving from the company, but the
strikers believe many of them will quit
to-morrow night.
Trains are going out with their cus
tomary loads and an inspection of the
sheds shows little signs of congestion.
Foreman Pat Dorn says the men are
doing good work, and unless they are
interfered with there will be no chance
of the union's being recognized.
No arrests have I been necessary on
account of the strikers, though there
was a slight demonstration at Fifth
and Townsend streets last nieht
caused by one of the special officers
getting frightened at the appearance ol
three men and calling for help. In his
excitement he overlooked one of the
regular officers, who was standing;
within a few yards of him talking to
a newspaper man. There was no ap
parent cause for the man's fear, yet
he ran up the steps that cross the
tracks and hastily summoned five of -
officers and the sergeant, who were
above. The. few strikers who were or
the opposite corner saw the offlcere
coming down the stairs in a hurry and
wondered where the trouble was. know
ing of no occasion for the demonstra
tion, i

Most Awful 8uffering

EIGHT DOCTORS
And Many Remedies Failed

of Good.
" About flrÂ« yearn ago I wm troabted
with Bora hands, bo Bor* that when I
would pat them In water the pala would
tÂ«7 nearly set me crazy, the skin would
peel off and the flesh would get hard
and break. There wooM be blood flow-
In z, from at least fifty places on each
hand. TVordÂ« eonld never tell the suf-
fering I endured for three years. I
tried ererythlng that I was told to use
for f ally three yearn, bnt could get no
relief. I tried at least eight differ en t
doctors, bat none of them seemed to do
roe any good, as my hands were as bail
when I got through doctoring as when
I first began. I also tried many reme-
dies, bnt none of them ever did me one
cent's worth of good. I was discour-
aged and bÂ«art-sore. I would feel no
bad mornings when I got np, to think
I had to go to work and s.Und the pnln
for ten hours, and I often felt like giv-
ing up my position. Before I started
to work mornings I would have to
wrap every linger up separately, so
as to try and keep them soft and then
wear gloves over the rags to keep
the grease from getting on my work.
At night I would have to wear, gloves
in bed. In fact, I had to wear gloves
all the time. Bnt thanks to Cuticnra,
the greatest of all great skin cures.
After doctoring for three years, and
spending much money, a 50c. box of
Cuticura Ointment ended all my suffer-
