There were the two women she;made
happy on the boat that ferried the spe
cial train from Benicia, kindly, riiodest
souls fired with the ambition to hand
down to posterity the story of how
they had talked. with the President's
daughter, timorous at making the ven
ture. They j approached her shyly,
statnmeringly. She beamed upon them
with genuine delight and friendliness,
and smiled and shook hands WITH
them, not down to them from the dizzy,
social height of a Washington belle.;:
The incident was a pleasure to her
as well as to them. ?; /*/;-- -

On thai same trip ,to - the Bohemian
Grove in the private car os_ the special
train, with, the carefully blue-penciled
invited party of those who were: consid
ered privileged to meet "the President's
daughter," she sat looking out of , this
window and then out of that eager to
see: every feature of this new country.
When the train made its first important
stoD at Santa Kosa, where the crowd had
gathered for a glimpse of the President's
daughter, Alice Roosevelt pressed her
1 face to the window, as she got '\u25a0 the
chance between introductions of the priv
ileged, and looked out - upon the people
as interestedly as they looked in upon
her. . ' ...
â¢ Somebody came to her and told her the
crowd wanted one good look at the Presi
dent's daughter.
There was a fleeting instant of natural
girlish shyness, and- then tne frank cor
diality bubbled up with a little laugh of
artless pleasure. in being made much of,
and she went out on the platform and
smiled and bowed in her friendly way,
and 'the crowd cheered.
When she came back to her seat her
bright* young eyes were moist and her
face flushed with pleasure and she. said::
"I- Just can't help,. feelingâ like thisâ
when they areâ when "everyone isâ soâ so
nice to me." ,

A NIGHT OFF
(OJpyright. 1904, by T. C. McClure.) \u25a0
TWOMBLEY had been watching with
silent satisfaction the very artistic
smoke garlands he was reeling off
his post-luncheon cigar. Suddenly 3
. his glance fell to the figure of the
girl bending over a desk by the window.
Evidently she was puzzled by the letter
he had' given ' her to his father's Vene
zuelan representative. She shifted her
position to throw a better light on> the
book. Incidentally it brought her profile,
out sharply against the early afternoon
sunlight. Twombley forgot all about the
smoke wreaths. .
"By Jove!" he said to himself, : "that's .
a profile for a sculptor. I wonder. where
che sprang from and where the governor
found her?" \ > \u25a0
"The governor,", otherwise Thomas
Twombley Sr., had been called suddenly
to London, and Thomas " Twombley '-' Jr.

The girl swung around to her desk and
the typewriter clicked ' insistently.' _> Tom â¢
laid down his cigar and bentâ¢ forward,
watching her curiously. It must be 'dev-:

THE 'next morning John, his head
6. fantastic,. jumble of mechanical
chaos. In which- the demon valve
motion accompanied by" his at-,
teadan* Imps "lap'?, and "lead"
rioted in a carnival with, the
grinning nightmares of "cut off," "heat
units," "combustion," and "valVo \ oil,''
turned his hesitating steps , offlcewa^d.'-,
Aggressively coc"ked springs or cross
equalizers laughed over . misplaced
blocking, improperly disconnected side
rods flailed red flre from twisted pins,
triumphant forward pins/ "on- some
builds of consolldated's"'ton guides and
yokes on thoughtlessly back-blocked
cross heads, side rock keyed on wrong
quarters 6creeched In sympathetic de
rision with the "Mammy, Daddy*! of lg
norantly Bet 'eccentrics.* While', triple
valves persisted in associating with
combining or equalizing tubes and over
all droned "If you Were running on' this
prder and got; this what would you
do? â go, or back up '--A pull in?" De
spite fears it was promptly at the
time "dt :gnated -when. John presented
himself at Mr./ Jasper's 'office.
The old gentleman, after, a cordial
welcome, waved him to a chair saying,
"I'm very *ad your turn for promqtion
finds you yefcjlri our. employ,. and here
at the clcse of Your firing I wish to Bay
that I've: never had a better man under
me. You have never been out of place,
or refused anything Tve called you for,
and, young man, you boys cannot real
ize how much such conduct helps to
Kmooth the way of your officials. Raw
hided as we are by our own as well as
the other side of the house, this office
is a coating of Invariably hot oil be
tween the grind of the motive power
department and the never relaxing
pressure of the transportation. So you
fee that an old. harassed fellow like
myself has very warm feelings toward
the lads on whom he can depend. I've
known you to 'double back' so tired
you could hardly stand to avoid a tie
up. It means a whole lot to a man in
trusted with the care of a complex ma
chine to know that In an emergency he
can find a wrench that will fit any nut,
no difference how hot or gTeasy, and
stick t- it until the work Is finished â
it's a tool he never voluntarily scrapes
â but -R-e had best get to business.
"\Vhat is a locomotive engine?" . â¢
John answering the Invariable exami
nations Alpha correctly, the others pass
ed in' rapid succession.
The mysteries of valve motion, from
eccentric to quadrant; the economical use
cf coal and oil; the handling to quick and
fafe advantage of the many mechanical
ills incident to the machine, occupied one
of the hottest hours John had ever expe
rienced. Finally the stern race of the in
quisitor relaxed Into a friendly smile, as,
extending his hand across the table, in a
voice of hearty congratulation, he said,
"You have made good use of your time.
Now take this note to Mr. Selk, the chief
train dispatcher, who will put you
through on a book of rules; bring his ver
dict to me; then I'll attend to marking
you* up." A few minutes later John
presented the paper to the official in-.
Etanccd. A brief seance witn that dapper
individual resulted in the following note:
"Jasper. M. M.: I have examined the
bearer, John Gray, upon book of rules,
train rights and orders and find him O. *
K. to cerve as engineer. L. L. S."
"All right." said . M r. Jasper, 'after
glancing the paper over. "Allow me. En
gineer Gray, to congratulate you upon
a very creditable examination and also to
allow a man Who has grown gray upon a
railroad to give you a little dose of talk.
Tbe position to which you have attained
is one of the most responsible held by
men. Except the train dispatcher, no one
in the railway service compares with you.

lute-control, ot ( hundreds of* tons of prop

that your first duty Is to the trusting

(Continued Next Sunday.)THE SUMMER GIRL AND HER
TRAVELING GOWN
Jf Europe Americans are considered
I the most peripatetic people in the
1 world. Not even . the authentic
J[ English globe-trotter excites so
iuu*h amazement as the American
travelers. .We are admired for our en
ergy and bravery and we excite aston
ishment for continued and rapid move
ments from one country to another in
liipid succession and, in sreat numbers.
The European marvels at the tourist
who leaves San Francisco and visits
New York. London. Berlin, Paris. Vi
cuna and Rome, besides countless other
places by the wajrj and returns to . his
or her home in the short space of three
or four months, and all for mere pleas
ure. These people are named Legion,
while the English srrolÂ»e-trottcr is an
isolated and singular individual; very
rare birds compared to the flock of
American sightseers and pleasure tour
ists. In Germany we are considered
quaint and peculiar and iv France we
are called the "Terrible Americans,"
and they are especially aghast "at
American girls who brave the dangers
and inconveniences of a long voyage to
live in Paris, unchaperoneil. for the
study of music or art, strong in their
native ability to take care of them
selves and make the best of their op
portunities. Xo such proceeding
would be possible among- the French
.or German people without an uprooting
of the -whole family and their house
hold gods. But we know personally
of many such instances even in this
\u25a0 one city of San Framfsvo, like Miss Lil
t lie Lawlor. Mis s Bessie Bowie. Miss
Carrie Little and others; all of them
studying music. One would suppose
that by this time some idea of Western
civilization would have effected . a
lodgment in the minds of Continental
instructors; but they retain tl^elr sin
gular notions" of the wildness'of this
city, as I can illustrate from my own
experience. When my sister and.my
seif were studying music at lioch
echulc in Berlin we wore one day re
quested by our teacher to remain after
the lesson' was finished, which, of
course, we did with fear and trembling-.
Â£est the. occasion should mean a severe
scolding about bad work. But, to our
astonishment we found the professor
consumed with an eager curiosity about
San Francisco, as he asked us if it were
true that there were lion hunts In San
Francisco in which ladies joined, /and
were the peaches there as big as mel
"'ons. He had evidently beeu stuffed by
come facetious and mischievous" people
with wild stories which he was in
clined to doubt, but which he thought
at least possible. Fortunately for' us,
lie considered us as Interesting, and
polished specimens of a semi-barbar

However, my object In this article Is not
to narrate interesting reminiscences of
my experiences in Europe, although that
temptation always presents, itself to my
mind, but to try to shed some light on
what sort of apparel it is desirable to
have on a trip that will stretch out to
more than 12,000 t tfiiles before reaching
home again. Although we are gradually
learning from our own /experience and
that of our friends what Is best to ; wear
and how to dress, yet it may not be amiss
lo give some aovice on the subject. First
comes the trip overland, which, though
not very bad in the winter season, yet
In summer, with the heat. the. dust and
the dirt, and general discomfort. Is ter
rible, and the question very naturally
arisesâ v.hat to wear? Lady MontaguV
advice. "Be plain In drcssand sober in
your diet," is very pood advice for travel
ing, but it Is a "puttering generality,"
when particulars are needed. To begin,
at the beginning, all Jewelry ehould , be
discarded, as the wearing of any jewelry
in traveling is bad form, and the only
object, jo far as appearances are /con
eidercd. is to look as clean and neat as
possible under the circumstances. I con
sider the best material ror traveling to
be taffeta slJk. It. fs light, cool and
â¢ pretty, and dust docs not" penetrate it,
while the external dust can be easily
ehaken off. One of the illustrations, to
day shows a very pretty .brown taffeta
traveling suit. The coat Is the new
Tuxedo style, very much the same cut ac,
a man** dinner Jacket. The collar, refers*:
rand cuffs are of. embroidered IJneri arid"
1 the shin is made Instep length. A shirt-/-'
tratet Is supposed to-be worn with thla
suit, but a dark taffeta' waist matching
the suit and with plenty of clean collars
and cuffs to' make .frequent changes will
prove to be the most serviceable, &\
though the wash waists are the most' eco
nomical' in the end. A silk . waist ; can
hardly be expected, after .a/ four days'
overland trip.. to. be In a "condition to.de
furiher duty. Toilet articles should not
be foi gotten, such as cold cream â¢or lo
tion for the face- and ' hands to prevent
the skin getting/ too dry and j -parched,'
for the water is always very hard, while
the duet and smoke are ve^y bad for -the
skin. Sometimes ether ls ; used for. that
purpose.- but- a very little of it on a small
piece of absorbent cotton Is sufficient It
is very cleansing.' Alcohol is also cleans
ing and refreshing. '
Hats should" be small, the, smaller the
better. The so-called-polo' hat, which is
quite new, seems â¢to me ' to t be an/excel
lent traveling hat,' as it Is small,' com
pact and very- durable. '^At 1 Davis* li. was
shown a! very pretty polo hat of .white
Milan straw,* â¢ with - a pretty cogue ; breast
on one side of it. It was small /and
xound and fit to harmonize -with -any. suit,
or 'waist, and It would be. very"? generally
becomlnsr. The black polo hat, - which/ is
made with brush pompons on one side,"
is probably better Â» for \u25a0 railroad traveling
than the white. :as it will ; show,; the
dust and dirt less. One of the illustra
tions gives a picture . of this -black polo
hat worn with an Oxford suit It": was
my misfortune ; once to cross/ the conâ
tinent with a ' woman, . who â¢ was ' dressed
plainly in black, ;but' the , secret/ of :thes
dressing-room revealed to me the hideous
fact that It, was not, only, herdress, that
was black, but. that all her clothing,!:
even her underclothing.; was* of "the same
funereal color. ; She even", forced , upon*, my^
unwilling confidence that i her; nightdress \u25a0

For ocean travel, one must have wafni
clothing even in summer. A flat steamer
trunk that will just slip under the berth
will probably hold all that is required for
a-voyagd^to Europe, although on tha
ocean liners the passengers dress a great
deal. Seasickness, however, frequently
obviates the necessity of giving any at
tention to dress, but during good weather
there is a good deal of gayety, and gen
erally plenty of good company, and con
siderable formality about dress. Special
attention should be given to shoe 3, for
on; board a steamer shoe 3 seem somehow
to be always In evidence. I therefore rec
ommend several changes of. shoes to be
taken, and all of these only the best. Wear
a short skirt, with a warm waist of some
kind.. or knit -woolen corset cover or
jersey that buttons down in front, with
long sleeves. A fur coat is also a very
desirable thing to have, to wear over the
dinner dress on deck in the evening. The
fur Is not injured by the damp air. and
comfort is assured, if one wishes to re
main on deck during romantic moonlight
evenings.'; ' . ,
I crossed^he . Atlantic last. year with a
very -, smart uweman <of â¢ New York, who
was evidently experienced in ocean travel.
She wore low tan shoes and tan colored
stockings, a well-made gray skirt, ankle
length, a silk waist and a squirrel jacket,
and carried a muff. Her hats were very
trim Bnd neat,. and were so well fitted to
the head that she had \u25a0 no trouble with
the wind. . .At .dinner, she worÂ« â¢ a dark
skirt and a pretty . light silk waist, and
occasionally -an entire light silk dress.
Dressing for " dinner is- de rigueur -for
women , and not ' conside red the .. proper i
thing * for, men. All passengers have to
provide themselves with their own steam
er, chairs and rugs, and it 13 important
to secure a good place for the chair at
the earliest possible moment, where ' it
is sheltered from â¢ the wind. One final
word of advice: to those who are going
to Europe for .the first time, and that is.*
engage a regular and convenient hour
for use of the, bath-tub and engage it aa
soon as possible, so that you will not find
that all the practicable hours are al
ready spoken â¢ - for. * and mark . all your
pieces of baggage, trunks. \u25a0 satchels, suit
cases and .hand-bags witn a distinct and
clearly defined mark, so that at the end
of? the voyage you may easily come by
your own again.

AM 6tUl uncertain which surprised
V me more, the telegram calling my
I attention to the advertisement or
I the advertisement itself. The tele
jt gram is before me .'as. I write. It
would appear to have been banded
in at Vere street at 8 o'clock in the
morning of May 11. 1897, and received
before half past at Holloway B.O. And
in the drab region It duly- found me,
unwasben but at work before. the day
grew hot and my attic insupportable. .
"See Mr. Maturin'a advertisement
Dally Mail might suit you earnestly beg
try will speak if necessary.
I transcribe the thing as I see it be
fore me, all in one breath that took
away mine; but I leave out the initials
at the end, which completed the sur
prise. They stood very obviously for
the knighted specialist whose consult
ing room is within a cab whistle of
Vere street, and who once called me
kinsman for his sins. More recently he
had called me other names. I was a
disgrace, Qualified by an adjective
which seemed to me another. I had
made my bed, and X could go and lie
and die in it. If I ever again had the
insolence to show my nose in that
house I should go out Quicker than X
came in. All this and more my least
distant relative could tell a poor devil
to his face; could ring for his man and
give him his brutal instructions on the
epot, and then relent to the tune of this
telegram! I have no phrase for my
amazement. I literally could not be
lieve my eyes. Yet their evidence was
more and more conclusive; a very
epistle could not have been more char
acteristic of its sender. Meanly ellip
tical, ludicrously precise, saving half
pence at the expense of sense, yet pay
ing like a man for "Mr." Maturin, that
was my distinguished relative from his
bald patch to his corns. Nor was all
the rest unlike him, upon second
thoughts. He had a reputation for
charity; he was going to live up to it
after aIL Either that or it was the
sudden impulse of which the most cal
culating are capable at times; the
morning papers with the early cup of
tea, this advertisement seen by chance
and the rest upon the spur of a guilty
conscience.
Well, I must see it for myself, and
the sooner the better, though work
pressed. I was writing a series of ar
ticles upon prison life and had my nib
into the whole system; a literary and
philanthroplcal daily was parading my
"charges," the graver ones with the
more gusto; and the terms, if unhand
some for creative work, were temporary
wealth to me. It so happened that my
first check had Just arrived by the 8
o'clock post; and my position should be
appreciated when I say that I had to
cash it to obtain a Daily Mail.
Of the advertisement itself, what is
to be said? It should speak for Itself
if I could find it, but I cannot, and only
remember that It was a "male nurse
and constant attendant" that was
"wanted for an elderly gentleman In
feeble health." A male nurse! An ab
surd tag was appended offering "liberal
salary to university or public school
man"; and of a sudden I saw that I
should get this thing If I applied for
it. What other "university or public
school man" would^ dream of doing so?
Was any other in' such straits as I?
And then -my relentless relative; he not
only promised to speak for me, but was
the very man to do so. Could any
recommendation compete with his in
the matter of a male nurse? And need
the duties of such be necessarily loath
some and repellent? Certainly the sur
roundings would be better than those
of my common lodging-house and own
particular garret, and the food and
every other condition of life that I
could think of on my way back to an
unsavory asylum. So I dived into a
pawnbroker's shop, where '"I was a
stranger only upon my present errand,
and within the hour was airing a de
cent if antiquated < suit, but little cor
rupted by the pawnbroker's moth, and
a new straw hat. on top of a tram.
The address given in the advertise
ment was that of a Hat on Earls court,
which cost me a cross-country Journey,
finishing with the District Railway and
a seven minutes' walk. It was ; now
past midday ,and the tarry wood pave
ment was good to smell as I strode up ,
the Earls court road. It was great .to
walk the civilized world again. . Here
were men with coats on their backs and
ladles in gloves. My only fear was lest
I might run up against one or other
whom I had known of old. But It was
my; lucky day. I felt it in my bones. I
was going to get this berth; and some
times I should be able -to v smell the
wood pavement on the old boy's
errands; perhaps be would insist on
skimming over it in his bath chair,
.with me behind.
-X felt auite nervous when X reached
the fiats. They were a small pile in a
side street, end I pitied the , doctor
whose plate I saw upon the palings
before the ground-floor windows; he.
must be in a very small way, I thought.
I rather pitied myself as well. .. I had
Indulged in; visions of better fiats than"
these. There -were no balconies. > The
porter was out of livery. There -was
no lift, and my invalid on the third
floor! I. trudged up. wishing I had
never lived In: Mount street,; and
brushed against a dejected Individual
coming -down. A full-blooded young
fellow in a frock coat flung the right
door open at my summons.
"Does Mr. : Maturin Uve here?" X in
quired. -. '.'\u25a0â¢'
"That's right." said the full-blooded;
young man, grinning all over a convivial
countenance. BMVPMssSWBBNHSH
"Iâ Fve come about bis advertisement
In the Dally Mail."
"You're the thirty-ninth." cried the
blood ; "that was the thirty-eighth you
met upon the stairs, and the ; day's still
young. Excuse myÂ«staring at you. Yes,
you pass your, prelim, and ' can . come in

Just after breakfast, but now,, the porter's
heading off the worst cases, and that last
chap was - the first * for twenty â¢ minutes.
Come in here." ftiQsSKBsVQEgflHi
And X was ushered into an empty room
with a good bay-window,:, which - enabled
my i full-blooded friend to Inspect me yet
more critically In a good . light. '." This he
did without the least false delicacy. Then
his questions began.
"Varsity man?"
"No." \u25a0
"Public school?"
I told him, and he sighed relief.
"At last! lou're the .very first I've not
had to argue with as to what is and what
is not a public school. Expelled??. ; V
"No." I said after a moment's "heslta-^
tlon; "no, I was not expelled. And I hope
you won't expel me If I ask a question in
my. turn?"
"Certainly not."
"Are you Mr. Maturin's son?"
"No, my name is. Theobald. You may
have seen it down below.". ,v -
"The doctor?" I said.. <â¢
"His doctor," 6aid Theobald with a,sat T
isned eye. "Mr. Matuftn's doctor.. He 'is
having a male nurse : and . attendant { by
my advice, and he wants a gentleman if
he can get one.' I rather, think he'll see
you, though he's only seen j two or three
all day. There are ' certain : questions
which he prefers to ask ; ; himself .- and
It's no good going over the same ground
twice. So perhaps. l had better: tell him
about you before we get any further."
And he withdrew to a room still nearer
the entrance," as I could hear,; for it was
a very small flat indeed. But now two"
doors were shut between us, and I had to
rest content with murmurs through the
wall until the doctor returned to summon
me.
"I have persuaded my patient to see
you," he whispered, "but I confess I am
not sanguine of the result ; He is very
difficult to please. You must -prepare
yourself for a; querulous invalid, and
for no sinecure If you get the ' billet/.' 1 .
"May I ask what's the matter with
him?"
"By all means â when you've got. the
billet."
Dr. Theobald then led the Vway, his
professional dignity so thoroughly In
tact that I could not, but smile as I fol-.
lowed his swinging coat tails to the
sick room.- I carried no smile across
the threshold of a darkened chamber
which reeked with drugs and twinkled
with medicine bottles, and in the middle
of which a gaunt figure lay abed in the
half-light. â¢
"Take him to the' window, take. him
to the window," a thin voice snapped,
"and let's have a look â¢ at . him. Open
the blind a' bit.! Not as much "as -that,

It was 10:30 when we left the flat in an
interval of silence ' on the noisy stairs.
The silence was unbroken by our wary

upon the very landing. Instead of going
downstairs Raffles led me up two flights,
and so> out upon a perfectly flat roof.
"There are two entrances to these man

chimney stacks; Vone to our staircase and*
another round the corner. But there s
only one- porter, and- he lives on the
basement underneath us and affects thÂ«

using the wrong stairs, and we ' run less

There was indeed â¢ some necessity for v
caution, for each half of the building had

*^f LXÂ»"who remember that I am
f [ the undefeated champion of
| I the world under the London
I prize-ring rules will please
Btand up. I don't see many to
count. Yes. indeedy. I am still the
champion of the world lz\ that class,
the toughest kind of fighting that has
been known in a long time. The top
notchers, who are balking, and side
stepping from me at this time, on the
ground that I am spavined and have
the heaves, don't know what real fight
ing: is.
I teas brought up under the London
prize rins rules, and when those rules
\u25a0were in force, only MEN fought. The
Quecnsberry rules allow only love-pats
compared with tue rough-house work
of former days. And when you know
that I am still champion of the whole
world under those old, heart-breaking
rules, don't it give me the right to a
look-in with the dainty boxers of to
day? Sure it does, and I'm going to
demand it till I get it.
I'm not sorry that the London prize
ring rules have been put overboard,
for they were sure brutal and tantaliz
ing. The glove is as good for showing
superiority as the naked fist, and with
the glove there Isn't the brutality of
the old days. But I more than made â¢
good with the fist, and mose who deny
the champion of the world under rules
that made blood -and-thunder reading
the right to show what he can do with
pillows on his fists, must have some
reason besides those their press agents
are giving out.
Right here let me say that I wrote
a letter the other day to Dr. Osier,
offering to put my fist through a door
half an inch thick and guaranteeing
that there'd be force enough' in the
punch when, it came through to put
him out'if he'd Tiold his head there on
the other side. And I'm 46. I haven't
heard from the doctor.
The Downfall of La Blanche, the Ma
rine.
I get the news that George La Blache,
the "marine." has gone before the Great
Referee. There was a man who did well
in bis time, and like many another
fighter went to the dogs when prosperity
began to find him. The Marine sat with
me one night till daybreak in the back
room of Martin Murray's place in Mill
ford, Mass., and he opened his heart
wide to the small bunch of us present.
At the time, I was with a minstrel show,
and the Marine was at the high tide of
his career. âke Gleason brought
George over from Boston to see me.
You remember that Jack Dempsey had
walloped the Marine, and when they met
the second time. La Blanche put Demp
ecy down and out with the pivot punch,
as it was called. This clout was an
unfair one, and the Marine tried hard to
ro&ice it appear that he was Justified in
handing it to Jack. He never got the
credit for defeating Dempsey right, and
I think that fight put both the Marine
and Dempsey on the toboggan. George
was punished on all sides because he de
feated Jack, who was liked by every
body, and that clout seemed to take all
the zip out cf Dempsey. who was stored
away by Lanky Bob, after the latter had
i "lain down" to Jim Hall in Australia. ,'
; Just the fame, George La Blanche was
, a good man In his trade, and deserved
: better than a shut-out from tut game
bo early. It would have been better for
.the Marine had he lost to Jack Dempsey
instead of winning with a punch that
wasn't on the square. There's a lesson
in this for fighters as well as other
people. Success gained by 'foul work
don't pay in the long run. Better go
down and out for the time being, In
fighting or business, and be square, than
to win and wear a tag that your a
ebyeter.
Real Old Stinsro From Santa Domingo.

Raffles held his right hand . under the
electric light, and a diamond ring flashed
upon his little finger. I could have
*u*orn It was not there five minutes be
fore.
The tradesman had a disappointed face,
but for a moment It brightened as he ex
patiated on the value of that ring and on
the price his people had accepted for It.
I was Invited to guess the ; figure, \ but . I
shook a discreet head. I have' seldom
been more taciturn In my life. ;.
"Forty-five pounds," cried the Jeweler;
"and it would be cheap at 50 guineas."
"That's right," assented Raffles.
"That'd be dead cheap, I allow. But
then, my boy, you gotten ready cash, and
don't you forget It"
I do not dwell upon my own mystifica

that I was keenly enjoying that very^ele

only my own attitude that was changed.

With a bunch of pugs, I made a tour
of the country in ISS3. when the sports
were curious to see the Boston boy who
had lowered Paddy Ryan to second place.
A lot of things happened. That was a
famous tour.* The coin rolled in almost
as fast as Rockefeller gets it. More than
$150,000 to the good was the record during
the nine months we were out. At every
stand I hung up $1000 for any mark who
would stay four rounds with me. That
thousand never got away. It was on duty
all during the tour and I never let it get
further than the place where it was
hung up." .
All kinds of tricks were played to get
that money. All kinds of punchers, gen

of how much better their system was
than mine, bums who would take any

"The rounds were longer than I reck

was only one right explanation for all.

The Alleged Attempt to Kill Him In

It was . thought by ' some In the party
that a certain foxy New Yorker who gave
an 1 alum-studded dog collar to advertise
a picture paper, was i nutty to get some

Fort Worth was young and gay, not the
serious: and proper place it is to-day. :; I
guess It led the world In cock-fighting,
and the cowboys came to town strong for
this epoirt. As a small return for the nice
way f we had been * treated in the town
I made a rather stiff bet on one of the

Chatted Out of Totvn by the Cowboy*.
My friends couldn't see any way out of
it except a quick duck for mine. I want
ed to stay and reason with * the boys,
knowing that they would fight fair. But
I was jammed into a wagon, held there,
and driven beyond the danger line. 1
believed at the time that it was a case
of stage fright on the part of my friends.
I couldn't convince them of this. They,
strenuously stuck to It that I'd have been
a dead one before daybreak had I stayed
in the town.
A doctor who looked me over the other
day said I was fit to fight at the drop
of a hat. "Your condition is wonderfully
good, so good that I wouldn't believe it
unless I saw it with my own eyes." said
he. Then he told me that he thought
my fine shape was because I had never
gone stale through over-training and be
cause I had never been severely punished
in the ring.
This backs up what I have always
claimed. Look back over tha fighters that
have gone and you'll find that few of
them have ever "come back" after they
once got it good. Jeffries has never yet
got a larruping. When hÂ© gets a few good
clouts, he'll frazzle up like a puff -of
smoke. Corbet has never done anything
since Fit* hit him, except to get up
games on the public After a boxer has
received a hard punching on top of the
strain of much training, he's In for keeps
unless he's a freak, like the Cornishman.
To-day I can take and give more
than any of them, bar none. I didn't
need a doctor's certificate to show me.
I knew it before the doctor, and here,
from the : highest place on the water
wagon, I repeat my defl to the best off
them. â¢ These duckers are -trying to drive,
me to fighting some of the chocolate-col
ored heavyweights as the only means left
for me to show the country that I'm good;
fighting timber to-day. But they'll never
drive' me to that.
I've never fought a negro and I never
â¢will. I came near doing it once, ia â¢elf
defense.. While Beelnff the sight* in a
town In Georgia, some years ago. a pow
erful negro who had come into town with
a pair 'of mules and some stuff loaded
onto a crazy-looking rig. offered to fight
ma right there and then. He looked
husky, and it did seem that I couldn't
sidestep. a go with him. for he insulted;
me something stupendous.
I had my right slung into position to
give him his when a slim , Southernerâ a
sure enough white manâ hopped between
us. The negro looked big enough to eat
the Southerner, but when the latter be
gan to talk to thÂ» owner, of the mule
craft, the warrior weakened at once.' In'
two minutes, the colored champion was
back on the hurricane deck of bis outfit,
looking two feet smaller and sorry ' ha

I have often thought that this affair
was & good picture of the race situation
down South. The whitÂ© people there
ought to be left to settle things their

trouble. They are a fine people, the
white men down South/ with heaps of
troubles of * their own; but with the
know-how to settle them, if let alone.
After he had saved me from doing up
the colored brother, the- slim Southerner
said: . . Â«
"Ah'm sorry, . sun, that you shud get

T TOW to dispose of your home
Â§\u25a0\u25a04 made handiwork is the great
X JL difficulty. I don't know of an
exchange where you do not have
to pay what they call an entrance fee.
Xow, more than nine-tenths of the wom
en who want work the most can't pay
this entrance fee.
I can only suggest that you canvass
\u25a0well your immediate neighborhood for
a sÂ«Je of something that you have, not
hesitating, to say that with the money
you are to pay the fee demanded, in
order to place your remaining work in
the exchange.
It seems a pity that arrangements
cannot be made to pay the fee after the
sale of goods. Hundreds of good work
er* are barred from putting their handi
work on the market just because "of this
ruling.
I Inquired why soch a law held, and
was told that If the exchanges took all
that was offered tliem their stores would
very soon be stocked ' with unsalable
goods not worth showing. To keep them
would be of no use. and to return them
often takes more in stamps than the

The First Call and Fashionable Hours
CotTTittX, IKS, by A. B. BÂ»rneÂ« & Co.,
Kew York.
IN MANY houses, between 4 and 5
o'clock In the afternoon, a cup of
tea is always offered to visitors.
The , maid either brings in a tray
containing a small teapot, a, silver
pitcher of hot waterâ in case the tea is
too strongâ a small pitcher of . milk or
cream, or a little, dish of sliced lemon
and plate of cake, or tiny three-corner
ed bread-and-butter sandwiches; or, if
there Is a tea table in the corner of the
room, the lady herself makes the tea
for ber guests; but the former method
is now deemed the smarter. Except oc
casionally, on a reception or at home
day, it 1b no longer considered good
form to have a tea table in the drawing
room.
Who Hakes the First Call.
When people settle in a small city or
town, or in the country. It Is courteous
for the residents of the place to make
the first call: upon the newcomers,
which must, of course, be promptly re
turned. Cven If some of these acquaint
ances, are net desired, really well-bred
people always return first calls within a
few weeks, allowing, if they so choose,
all subsequent calls to be unreturned by
them. And so . the acquaintance can
generally lapse without .the cut direct
and the bitter feeling 1 that ; would : un
doubtedly. bÂ« caused by the failure . to
return the first visit of a neighbor.
In lax?* cities tte population is so

So, eince there is no evading the en
trance fee, if you want your goods on
sale at the exchange you must bend
every effort first to raising the amount
required. The fee Is generally $2.
"But how can I get in touch with an
exchange?" you ask.. "I am way up>
here in the country, miles from any
city!"
Names are not necessary. Just direct
a letter to the "President of- the Wom
an's Exchange" of the city, inclosing a
stamp for reply. You will generally get
an answer, if there is an exchange in
the place. Ask for their rules and regu
lations. The inclosed stamp will bring
an answer of some kind, and the rules
will tell you what to do next.

\u25a0 $SOO to $400 a year. The solution of the
problem is . yet to . be found. It will
probably lie in the adoption of a more
communal form of life. Distributive
kitchens, or kitchens worked by expert
cooks, where ready-cooked food Is sent
out in properly heated .carts, have long
been talked of. In some countries the
system , works well and cheaply. I know
of two attempts in . London, but the
movement Is spreading, and the rapid
successj of the kitchens already In ex
istence augurs well for the enlarge
ment of a* system which in economy,
efficiency and general convenience leaves
the poor domestic kitchen far behind.
In view of these excellent openings for
women, , it may seem hardly credible to
you that they are so little known. But
day after day_ people come to the bureau
Insisting that work of an indefinite kind
must be possible to obtain.and It is quite
the hardest and saddest part of the work
to be obliged to 'undeceive them. , They
want companionships, housekeeperships
in small families, daily work, dusting,
arranging (lowers, reading aloud, and
even taking out ladies* pet dogs for
walks. 'Anything, so long as It is not
"menial." (How often I' wish that word
could ibe abolished !) "Any position of
trust" means, as a rule, no definite
work, and it would not be honest of me.

made for this purpose. When this simple
remedy . does - not . effect a speedy \u25a0- cure
it, will be necessary to use more vigorous
means, and a doctor should be consulted
at once. After treating baby's eyes the
hands : should .be thoroughly scrubbed
with hot water and soap.
Colic.
:K During the first few months some,
babies are apt to have attacks of colic
often caused by indigestion. : The chili!
screams sharply, draws^up his legs and
usually has, a hard, tense abdomen.
First: warm his hands and feet and
turn him .on his stomach, letting him
lie on, a hot- water, bottle or hot niece of
flannel. 'Gently pat his back to help uy
the wind, and Â« give him a little hot
water by- means of a medicine dropper :
a-few drops of essence of peppermint
may., be added the wate?. Do^ut
give him gin or herb teaa. .
If- the attacks are frequent. , the food

.The] mother must; lnvariably have Â».
free movement of the bowels each day*'OXE OF the mem vivid recol
lections of ray childhood
in the Old Virginia we
know now by name alone
as of the practice of preserving and
pickling after sunset favored by
rr.any notable housewives.
My own .mother, whose pickles
and preserved fruits had a reputa
tion that outran the limits of our
ccunty, maintained that the even
ing *'cool of tbe day" was the only
time when such work was tolerable
in the dog-days â a . season never
less than six weeks long in that lati
tude. And since fruits ripened in
the torrid heat that tried the
p.-.tience of nan an! beast, the win
ter supply of conserves must be put
up under the cover of night.
At sunset, then, the fire was kin-
Hled in the "kitchen yard" â an in
closure surrounding what our
English forbears and cousins of this
generation call "offices." Upon the
plantation they were "quarters," the
kitchen, always detached from the
"house," occupying the front rank.
The fire was -f dried bark, never of
the "lightwood knots," alias pitch
pine, used for other "nres." Bark
burned with a clear, hot flame, and
left enduring, smokeless embers.
The smooty smoke of resinous woods
â¢would taint the flavor of "lucent
iyrnps tinct with cinnamon,**
KAKUfO DUTIES NOBLE .
The fruit was prepared by colored
assistants in the daytime, always
under the mistress* supervision. In
deed* hers was usually head rather
than, hand work. Gentlewomen of
her day thought more of the deli
cacy cf .complexions and hands than
yk do. And hands of coarser make
were superabundant.
Propped in my bed to a position
that commanded a view of the scene, *
I would lie until my legitimate
sleepy hour â¢was long past, watching
the play of the dancing flames upon
houses and trees and the groups of
moving figures collected about the
big copper cauldron. Children read
gTown people's books then â and were
none the "worse for it. Nobody
thought me priggish when I, told
my father at breakfast one xnorniiur
that what I had seen the night be
fore reminded me of the witches'
cauldron and dance in "Macbeth" â
addingâ - Ã¼ Ãut for mother in her
white dress 2"
My vocabulary was not equal to
the expression of the fancy that had
possessed my rcctless brain in my
vigil, namely, that the white figure,
still and steadfast, directing - the
movements of subordinates, made
me think of a strong, kind angeL
Dimly then^nore and more distinctly
es the years have gone by, I came
to the perception of the poetry of
household tasks. Looking _ back, I
ra grateful tliat I appreciated, as
a child, that it was not an orgy, but
a ceremony â decent, beneficent, el
most solemn â of which I was the
charmed witness.
If my reminiscent sketch have
any merit, it is a lesson in this great
truth. The true gentlewoman of
that all-so-long-ago brought culinary
dutiesâ and they were- many and
tediousâ up to her level, instead. of
lowering herself to them! . )
In the more bustling, exacting
routine of modern living I have ad-;
bered to the idea that the cool of 'the
day is the best time for summer
cookery. But I act upon it with: a
difference. Late dinners, dinner .
toilettes and evening social engage
ments preclude the practicability of '
what our mothers found easyoffae^

no more. : It huz been my; habit for
years to yet jellying, preserving and

GANNING AND PRESERVING
IN THE
OLD FASHIONED WAY
clothed and fed. 1 have had such
genuine satisfaction in carrying out
the plan that I speak as one having
authority in commending the like
practice.
If jellying bo the order of the
morrow, and currants or berries are
to be thus "treated," have them
picked over and washed over night,
then^ packed, with the moisture
clinging to them, in a stone or agate
ironware jar. Setthis in a pot of
cold water, and let the first duty of
the new day be to light- the fire or
gas under this pot. By the time you
are dressed, the fruit will be broken
to pieces and thoroughly heated. Re
move from the range and take the
jar out of the pot-that it may cool
the sooner.
As soon as it can be handled with
a tolerable degree of comfort, strain
through a double cheesecloth' bag.
measure and return to the fire in a
porcelain-lined or : agate ironware
kettle and bring quickly to the boil.
Weigh your sugar, a pound for each
pint of juice, put into shallow pans
and shut -up in a heated oven, stir
ring now and then to hinder it from
When" the -juice has
boiled twenty minutes,- add the hot
sugar, stir until.it is^lis^olved, boil
just one minute, take' from the fire
and fill yo\?r glasses. .;\u25a0-
These should be laid . in hot wa
ter, ready to your hand. Take out
one at a time, dripping wet and
heated through; fill to overflowinsr
and set asidu tntil cold and firm. If
everything be prepared beforehand,
and not a minute be" lost in the
various stages of the work, the jelly
should bo made and all traces of the
work out of the way by 8 o'clock.
I know it tan be'doneâ and easily.'-
SOME GOOD KECIPES
Peaches and "'quinces should be
prepared for jelly or marmalade the
night before, covered with ice wa
ter to freshen them, then set in the
refrigerator. Drain in the morning
and proceed as with berries.
A recipe for putting up tomatoes
in cold water appeared last week. I
give to-day instructions for preserv
ing these and some fruits "in the
usual way. * .
Canned Tomatoes.
Pour boiling, water, over the- tomatoes
to. loosen; the skins.. Remove V these;
drain off all the Juice", that will \ come
away without pressing hard; put 'them
into a kettle and heat slowly <to a ' boll.
Your tomatoes will look much, nicer, if
you remove all the 'hard parts - before
putting them â¢on the lire, = and â¢ rub the
pulp -soft- with; your .hands.: Boll 'J ten
minutes, dips out the surplus liquid, pour
the tomatoes, bolting not, into the cans,
and seaL : Keep them In - a cool.* dark
place. .., ,: :. / .Â«.â¢.-\u25a0
As additional precaution, wrap each
Jar In paper to_ exclude 'the light. *
Canned Plums.
. Twelve quart* .of ; plums, ; one v pint ot
water. : one pound ,of sugar. Put ;, the
sugar and water > on s. the stove lln I the
preserving kettle. Prick each plum with
a needle to prevent bursting, and *as
soon as the sugar is dissolved turn the
fruit; into the kettle. Â« Heat,very;slow
ly .to \u25a0a - boil, j* and cook for nyÂ« min

plums alone, pour over, them the scald

however, . If - there .is 1 much- juice in the

number of cans to- be filled, .without

HEN you are look-
Ing \u25a0 for a house,
remember that an
all-important fea
ture upon which
the comfort of the
entire family de
pends is the heat
ing apparatus. "- .
The best way to
find out about its
capacity is. to
make inquiry . re
garding it of some
persons using one
of the same kind
In some other
house. You should
try to get a per
fectly frank state
ment as -to Its
heaang power in proportion to its con
sumption of fuel, i But. of you
must also learn about the draught and
other particulars relating s to the house
tnat you have under â¢ special considera
tion. People who neglect to Inform them
selves - In advance Â» about these matters
sometimes. discover when it Is too late
that the cost of coal for heating makes
such . unexpected " inroads upon their In
comes' they- are \u25a0 compelled .to abandon
the cellar neater and warm their houses
with stoves and open fires. A young
couple, "acquaintances - of the' writer,
after meeting with sad reverses of for
tune." went into a house where they ex
pected sto \u25a0 live , economically - until the
business â¢ prospects â¢ of the husband
should improves After a brief and very
expensive experiment" \hey found that
the cellar . heater consumed such an
amount of * fuel j without \u25a0 warming the
house.' that they. could not afford to use
It Consequently \u25a0 they - were \u25a0 obliged to
resort^-to .stoves, with all the increase
of. labor and extra trouble to keep clean
that- stoves : cause. The heater in their
cellar â¢ Is . always empty. \u25a0 cold and abso
lutely useless. '-.'\u25a0.â¢ - .-.\u25a0-..
Before beginning to look at houses
with a view either to renting or buying,
decide upon 'the price that you can and
trill. pay in; rent or for purchase. ;Keep
the , price * ever â¢ In ; mind, that you * may
waste no time or strength in looking at
houses above - your limit â unless you
have time and vitality to throw away.
House-hunting is a laborious business,
and "should not be entered Into unad
visedly or lightly. -Devote a notebook to
it* in ..which > you .Jot ; down ; every item
that concerns -. the . new home. ' On pags
1 set the price; after that, -in their
orders of importance,."! everything that
you desire find in the house that you
â¢will 'decide;: to 'take.-; Never go to look
at'a house without the notebook In your
pocket. As you go about examining tha
building and the premises keep the note
book open in your hand.- When making
your own ; memoranda â¢ beforehand leava
several, blank pages between your notes
regarding' the requisites .for tha house.
Then \u25a0 you \u25a0 can ' jot down , the advantages
and ;â¢ the "disadvantages; of houses that
you visit during your, quest.'"..'
. \u25a0 , ir DON'T WASTE YOITB TIME \u25a0-,
.This plan will i prevent your confusing
one -i house V with j another,? and .will ba
less I fatiguing I than I trying to I remember
too much in detail \u25a0â¢ without < the =. little
memorandum I book f f or .; references. ;It
may J also prevent "some * very decided
differences' of opinion "between two or
more who go . house-hunting, together.
The ; little^ notebook ' will keep the . peace
when" everybody^ is "tired fand J perhaps
somewhat' cross over the business.*' '.V-L"\
"\u25a0\u25a0 When \u25a0'\u25a0 the *"chlef ; points of -a i house
prove unsatisfactory, it is wasteful to
expend any- f uri-^r. thougnt : or strength
upon it.* ilt \u25a0; is* safe Ito v say a that -.t you
find a house with its root in perfect or
der. 1 - its cellar 'dry and" well arranged
with 'Â« a" cemented floor. : and 'its plumbing
equal to the: severest test, you may rea
sonably, expectito, find the other depart
ments well; kept. up;tn;good repair. -On
the other hand.'if any.one.'.or. all, three.*
of those salientfeatures should prove to

likely to find the house desirable or oth
erwise In repair. Never be misled by an
attractive front and entrance. They
often hide a multitude of defects. It Is
also well to bear in mind that furni
ture, pictures and screens may be so
arranged as to cover very unsightly and
objectionable conditions. Above all, do
not bind a bargain before you Inform
yourself regarding the healthfulness of
the locality. A friend of the writer lost
a thousand dollars by deciding quickly
upon a house that he, too late, discover
ed was not -in a healthy neighborhood.
He gave up the bargain and forfeited
the sum that he had paid down befora
the deed was drawn up.
When looking for a house take noth
ing for granted. Inspect. Inspect," la
epect every portion. Accept whatever
the landlord or his agent may tell you
about it with generous allowances of
salt.- Unremitting vigilance la the prica
of securing a house in, good repair as
well as of keeping It so.
If possible, live for a year In & bourn
that'you think of purchasing. Know all
about its advantages and its disadvan
tages within doors,- and also all about
the neighborhood and the soil . upon
which it is built, whether wholesome- or
unwholesome. There la nothing likÂ» oc
cupying a. house to disclose its charac
teristics and to uncover very .objection
able features that may. easily be over
looked, when you are going over 'tt. es

DEAELY BOUGHT EXPEBIE2TCB
Moving Is hard and expensive, but bet
ter move twice than buy what you can
not readily sell without a great sacri
fice. Remember that buying and rent
ing are far easier than selling or sub
letting after the property is on your
hands. The more. anxious you are to ba
rid of it the harder it will be to> And any.
cue who wants It at any price.
Every reasonable person knows t>^t a'
house which has not been just renovated
will probably require \u25a0 some repairs.
Painting, papering, wood-polishing and
lloor-staming, when necessary, can bo
done, with the cost estimated before
hand, if you buy, and allowance can be
maae for expected expenses that wtli
keep you within the purchase price that
you leel you can afford to pay. if you
are renting, that Is the time to get from
your landlord more repairs than be will
be likely to make after you are living
In the house. Therefore It is well to
make all discoveries of necessary re
pairs while you are only a prospective
tenant ' and ths owner's anxiety to se
care you makes him readily accede .to
your requests. The landlord of an emp
ty house and the landlord when the tea
ant is in are about as different to tha
tenant asking tor repairs as Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde. â¢ . .
-We have often â heard" < It remarked;
"You must build one house. before you

IN the country when neighbors gel
together they inquire of one an
other: "What ever became of -old.
So and So?" They know what be
came of him; they have discussed
him more than a hundred times, but
they know that the Question as to
what became of him prompts some one
to tell stories about him, stories that
they havo heard so often as to be able
to foretell what is coming, word, for
â¢word. , â¢ .
It was a lazy afternoon. Beneath
the trees, the grass, headed out, was
nodding sleepily. Off in the sky a buz
zard floated, like a somber memory in
a mind otherwise, clear. Along the
road an ox cart creaked its dry-axel
way. Old Llmuel sat on the ground
with his back a&rainst an oak. A ban
dana handkerchief showed red in his
hat that lay beside him. On the sward
several young 1 fellows were sprawled,
one of them holding a tuft of grass In
his moutli, as if he were too" lazy to
s-pit it out. Old Brisintine was talk
ing about a pair of shoes that had
lasted him for more than a year when
another ancient resident, with hairy
chest exposed, a glimpse of winter
stubble, inquired as to what ever be
came of old Rodney Salem. Every one
looked at Llm. The old man spoke:
"That feller could ask more ques
tions than a boy out with his grand
father. This would naturally argy that
after a while he'd be \ compelled to
know somethin'. but he qever did.
With him inquiry didn't result in wis
dom. It didn't result in anything: but
more inquiry. I recollect once that an
Englishman came to the town of
Purdy, the first one that was. ever seen
there, I reckon. He wasn't dressed so
different from other men, but the min
ute he talked everybody stopped to
listen. He had traveled a good deal,
necessarily, but with it all he was an
innocent sort of a man. He, was sitting
in front of the hotel when old Rodney
Salem came along. He sat down on a
bench and asked the Englishman if he
didn't think it was going to rain. The
Englishman answered that .he didn't
know, he was sure. Old Rodney looked
at him a while and then asked him
where he was from. â¢
" "From London, sir.*
" 'Ah, hah. 'Well, what's the news in
your settlement?*
"The Englishman started as if a
briar had raked him; *I don't know, I'm
sure.'
"Rodney studied for a moment 'Old
town, ain't it?" he inquired.
" 'Heavens, yes. man."
" 'I 'lowed so" from all I'd been able
to gather. On a river, ain't it?' â¢
" 'Yes. on the Thames.' ...
" 'Suffer much from high water?'
â¢"Xot at all.'
" 'Have no trouble with June rises?'
" 'None whatever, sir.'
" 'Cypress trees - growin* along the
banks, I reckon.'
"The Englishman looked at him and
caid nothing. Old Rodney went on: \'I r
'lowed they must be June rises, for I
hearn somcthin' about a tower there and
I thought mebby it was built so as to
give the folks a chance to git up out
of the way of the freshet* â¢
"The Englishman looked at him pity
ingly and said: 'No one knows when the
tower was built.' 3ra|
" 'Mighty nigh as old as the river, I
reckon. Ain't there a man llvln* there
named Gladrock?'
"'Do you mean Gladstone? Well, yes,
you might say he lives there.'
" 'About the smartest man in town,
ain't he?*
" 'A very able man, sir.'
" *Gqt mortgages on the whole neigh
borhood, I reckon.'
"'Really, my dear sir. you are very,
very peculiar I must say.'
" 'Needn't say it unless you want to.
May I ask what your business is here?'
The Englishman started, again, but an
swered: "I'm here to look at timber.'
" 'Political timber? Wall yander goes
Bill Mason, candidate for Sheriff, about
as good timber as we've got'
44 Trees, sir.'
" 'Oh, trees. Don't want to buy a 'pos
sum dog. I reckon,*
" 'I do not*
" 'I've got one that never told- a lie in",
his life. Is the Queen a right: sociable
sort of an old lady, blr?' â¢ / -;
" 'Sir,* exclaimed the . Englishman, you
are unendurable. I am a guest of this
hotel. Evidently you are not. 'Therefore,
will you please leave me?' .
" 'Excuse me/ said Rodnes\ ' .'I didn't
want to tech on anythlri': unpleasant/^ If
the ain't sociable mebbyit ain't her fault

Rodney by the . collar, wheeled : him
around and kicked him into the street.
Rodney. got up, takin' his own time about
it, too, and 6aid: 'If you ain't busy next
week, mister, I'd like to hire you to
thrash my wheat.'
"But you were asking what became of

, "My son, ; there's a difference- between
Inquiry and questions. Inquiry is silent;
questions are generally asked, not for the
purpose of ' gainin* knowledge, but be
cause torn* feller wants to hear himself
talk. The inquisitive man is usually the
idlest man. Questions are a form of lazi
ness "breakin* out The laziest man Is
usually the greatest talker. Wisdom is
sometimes so ' busy with itself that it
keeps silent You can always hear ignor
" ance. * It asks questions when it can't in
vent any thin' else to say. The worst
. thing for a young man just startln' out
is to l want to hear his ; own voice. Be
cause his employer is polite enough to
listen he imagines that his talk is wincin'
a place for him. but nine chances to oriÂ»
he'll be ' the first feller discharged. Tho
habit of not askln* too many ques
tions Is a sort of wisdom "Itself.
The readiest . talker ain't the best com
panion. The man that causes you to
think is tha best companion, for there is
no thin* more pleasant, mo ra thrillin* than
the birth of a thought Whenever an
old man conceives a new thought he is
for the moment young: again."
"But, Uncle Llm, how ts.lt with
woman? Is her best companion the one
that causes her to think?"
"Look here, young feller, want old

you for the information," he said. "Good

ASIA SEEK
PEACE IN
WASHINGTON
STEPHEN BONSAL
OUR diplomacy is only 130 years old
and yet next month the plenipo
tentiaries of Europe and of Asia
will assemble in Washington to
settleâ upon, it is to be hoped, a
permanent basisâ the destinies of
the Far East and the lands that
lie across thÂ© Pacific. Ten years ago the
representative of the American Govern
ment was a rank outsider in the congress
of nations; ro-dsy, by common consent of
all the great powers, the situation cre
ated by the Russo-Japanese struggle 'is
referred to. the gcod offices of our Chizt
Magistrate, and the conference to whlcrj
he has paved the way is regarded as tho
only possible, yet by no means certain,
way of escaping from the world war that
has been threatening ever since the mid
night "attack of the Japanese upon Port
Arthur.
Fox weal or for woe we are now right
in the midst cf things, and it behooves
us to walk circumspectly. In the ap
proaching congress of the nations J wntch
is to be convened in Washington, If we
are to live up to the traditions of our di
plomacy, as wa undoubtedly shall, we
may well play the part of the "honest
broker," thouffh not at all in the sense
the terra was applied to "Broker Bis
marck," who took commissions and Im
portant percentages from all the dispu
tants who wrangled at the congress of
Berlin. While nominally the conference
is confined to the principals in the great
struggle in Manchuria and on the Jap
anese Sea, many great powers will be
represented and interested in the delib
erations In the most vital way. We who
look on are bound to neutrality, but at
the same time we cannot forget who sup
plied Aguinaldo with' arms, cr. in the
words of Dr. Holmes, "who was our
friend when the world was our foe."
To-day Europe and Asia meet for a
diplomatic tourney on American soil and
in an arena made possible by American
brains, yet little more than a century
ago an American Minister, whether ac
credited to Europe " or to Asia, was a
much to be pitied individual. Our first
diplomat of record was Silas Deane of
the Nutmeg State, and in his Instruc
tions â¢ f fora ' Congress he. was directed to*'
assume the came of Timothy. Jones and
the character of a merchant in the West
India trade. The advantage of "acquir
ing Parisian French" was impressed
upon him, and whether he. was so in
structed or not it is certain that the cau
tious Silas carried .with him upon his
embassy a large supply of invisible ink
witL which to write" to* Congress. In
form Mr. Deane's diplomacy may have
been crude, but he had good ideas and
he knew that all embassies In one sense
or another must be gift-bearing to be
epcccssfuL So he writes home to the
Continental Ccngteea shortly after his
ariivai in Paris:
"The Quc-ca is fond of parade and is
our friend. She loves riding on horseback.
Cou!J_ you send me a fine Narragansett
hor.se -or two or a few barrels of apples?
The money would be well laid out."
Our diplomatic beginnings In Asia date
from the day of Andrew Jackson and
they were as hunible and as creditable as
the achievements of .Mr. Dcane at the
courts of _lhe effete monarchies of Europe.
Edmund Qoberts was "Old Hickory's"
'EmbassaJor, and a better man we have
t}f\(r sent across ? ither ocean' to give
the outsi<3Â«i world a taste of our quality."
Our sruw'nsr trade in the East was, as
Jackso'ii f-ta:ed in his message to Con
gress.'subject to pecuniary extortions and
vexatious ;rni>oE"tions and we sent out
Mr. Roliâ¬tt<? ta <lemand the "open door."
Â£o, you see. this is not a very new idea.

vote of Congress, the members 'of the
Embassy were declared tqe, guests of
the United States, and they .were wel
comed by Mr. Blalne In an tetoquent* ad
dress and by â¢â¢Walt" Whitman- In a
poem which was prophetic, sradei those
days the Marquis has been prime Min
ister three or four times aftd. negotiated
a number of the most Important for
eign treaties. In only one he .fueled,
and that 'was not his; fault, for^wabvln

Ito was the apostle have penetrated to

with his programme of A3ia for ths
Asiatics, shorn, as he says It Is, of any
menace to the Western World. Should
he appear in Washington iir nam,e~thÂ«
Marquis Ito will only represent. Japan,
but behind him stand the untold mil
lions of China and Tibet* of Annam
Slam, and of Cambodia. ";' \ â¢
With" Marquis Ito is associated Mr. Ko
mura. the clever -young Minister of For
eign Affairs in Japan, who conducted tbÂ»
Marchurlan negotiations which ted up to
the war In a manner ses, satisfactory to
his Empercr. Mr/liomura/.ts' a Harvard
man, like Mr. Kurino. who represented
Japan at St. Petersburg :up to the ,'o.ut
break of the war, and they both 'speak
English with a strong Boston' accent/.' Mr.
Takahira, the third plenipotentiary,* is la
weir known as the efficient guardian of
Japanese interests in Washington for thÂ»
last three years as to require no further
mention here.
.The latest news from Toklo would seen
to Indicate that Marquis Ito may not at
tend tho conference in person, but limit
his activity to inspiring , the Japanese
Foreign oflice from his beautiful villa on
the sea at Oiso, that mo.v charming,, spot
on the Japanese Riviera^ ;where the now
venerable Japanese statesman loves to
retire from the burden of the state at
faits which he'has borne so many year*.
If the Marquis Ito should not come to
Washington, as now seems probable, thÂ«
Russians will be In a measure to blame
In not having appointed a ' man with
whom hÂ« could, according Â»o the Japan
ese etiquette, confer without condescen
sion on vis part.- The Russian plenipo
tentiaries are only men of the rani
which Marquis Ito has created and
commissioned scores of .times In 'his life.
But should ' Russia send" an envoy. of thÂ»
rank or. Witte to the conference there
can be no doubt that Marquis Ito -would
be there to meet him.
The fact that the war on the Russian
side has been so luckless will probably
disincline- the Russian Government to
name a military plenipotentiary, and so.
of course, in accordance with the eti
quette which governs such occasions. thÂ«
Japanese cannot be represented by Field
Marshal Yamagata or any of tho- other
military men who- have been nominated
by the Japanese press .for the brilliant
but onerous "post of envoy. '-"-a -
It 13 a pity that our chance of receiv
ing Yamagata Is so slight. '\u25a0 for he 1 is a
wonderful and in ihW- person, illus
trates the' wonderful story of Japanese
military development. When he entered
the army Japanese soldiers wore armor
and "false faces," carried two swortjs
and drilled in the "infuriated tiger" <Jr
the "enraged elephant" formations,- but
in 1900, on the China relief expedition, ho
commanded the Japanese contingent,
which was regarded by all the officers
of the allied armies as the most modern
and up-to-date military force which up
to that time .the world had ever seen.
Mr. Knmura, who in default of
Marquis Ito, his master and patron, may
head the Japanese mission. -is one of the
most remarkable of the younger men In
Japan. In appearance he is Insignificance
personified, weighs about " peventy-flvÂ«
pounds and has been likened by those*
who loved him net to a mosquito, one of
the bad kind. For the last . ten year*
Mr. \u25a0 Komura. though I should- say .ho

AWFUL SCENES AT JITOMER
Hundreds of People Killed by Mobs
Stirred by Paid Agents of Gzar.\-
Special Cable to The Call.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 15..â During
the last few weeks there has been a
rerivE.l of Jew-baiting In various parts
of Russia, and particularly In the west
ern province* bordering on Germany
and Austriaâ that Is, in those parts of
the Russian empire which ought to be
most accessible to Western culture and
civilization. These anti-Semitic out
breaks have not received adequate at
tention In the newspaper press of Rus
sia or of other countries. Laconic offi
cial reports Issued in St. Petersburg
and communicated by cable to other
parts of the world have supplied merely
the barest hint of ghastly horrors
which would shock the conscience of
the civilized world if they were fully
known and understood.
Since the Russian Easter, that Is, the
end of April according to our calendar,
there have been anti-Semitic riots in a
score of Russian towns and in about
fifty Russian villages. In the course of
these riots more, than 500 Jews were
killed and approximately 10,000. wound
ed. In addition to these casualties it has
been ascertained that more than 1000
Jewish women were outraged. Several
hundred houses belonging to Jews were
entirely demolished and razed to the
ground. Five hundred shops belonging
to Jews were completely plundered and
tacked and 1000 dwellings inhabited by
Jews were looted. These figures, how
ever, terrible as is the tale which they
tell, do not convey an adequate impres
sion of the horrors which were enacted
by the bloodthirsty mobs of fanatical
Jew-baiters.
FOSTERED UY TREPOFP.
One of the worst features of this con
certed outbreak of anti-Semitism in
different parts of the country was the
official support which was given to the
anti- Jewish agitation. Those who are
well informed regarding the course of
political events ' behind the scenes in
.Russia ascribe this official support of
violent anti-Semitism to General Tre
pcrt. who. *ltho\rtfO'*ntsntttrany~TiotElHg
more than Governor General of St. Pe
tersburg, is really the most powerful
mini In Kussia. General Treporf consid
ers that it is-good pollcyon thepart of
the Russian Government to encourage
Jew-baiting among the Russian people
in order to withdraw popular attention
from domestic affairs and from th<- col
lapse of the Russian army and navy in
the Far East. General Trepotf believes
i hat it the Russian populace, so to speak,
U-ts off steam by massacreing and blud
geoning the Jews they will be less in
clined to be discontented with the con
duct of the war and with the domestic
policy of the Government. Consequent
ly General Trepoit has exerted all his
influence in fa.vor of violent anti-Semit
ism, and it has been proved beyond
doubt that the recent outbreaks in the
western provinces of the Russian em
pire were instigated by agitators .Who
came from St. Petersburg and were ac
tively supported by the local authori
ties. :
AOIJXTS OF THE CZAR.
One of the worst outbreaks took place at
Jitomir, the capital of the province of
Volhynia: About three, weeks before
the anti-Jewish riots began six stran
gers arrived from St. Petersburg and
began to prepare the ground for the
accomplishment of their blooaihirsty
design. They waited on the orthodox
Ureek Archbishop of Jitomir and made
representations to him regarding the
evil influence which the Jews exercised
over the Russian nation. They de
clared that the Government had proofs
that the Jews all over Russia were the
sworn enemies of the orthodox Greek
church and were scheming not only to
overthrow absolute government, but
also to bring about the confiscation of
the vast wealth of the state church for
the relief of taxpayers. They reminded
the Archbishop that the procurator of
the holy synod, Pobledonostzeffv is a
confirmed anti-Semite and has fre
quently : . given his support to anti-
Semitic outbreaks. They persuaded the
Archbishop to look with favor on Jew
baiting, and in the course of a few days
had contrived -to convince his eminece
that It would-be most advantageous if
the Jew* of Jitomir were severely chas
tised for their ; revolutionary and Ir
religious opinions. *
These agitators from the capital also
put themselves In communication with
the general commanding, the eleventh
Russian army corps, whose headquar
ters are at Jitomir. They worked on
him by means ': of similar arguments
_and experienced little 'difficulty, in ob
taining from him a promise that his
troops should not interfere to. protect
the Jews If an outbreak should take
place. Popular feeling against the Jews
was worked up ip a variety of ' ways.
Thousands of pamphlets, were circu
lated In which statements ; .were printed
to the effect that the Jews were blood
suckers and traitors and primarily re
sponsible for all the troubles of the
Russian nation. Strong < antl-Semitio
arttalea were launobed lnto the local
newspapers and the local priests were
Induced to preach a sermon advocating
violence against the Jews. Local agi
tators were hired at . a price , of one
ruble. a day to go "about among the
manses of the common - people \u25a0 and _â¢ to
stir popular feeling against the Israel
ites up to the boiling point. .-'
PENNED - IN SYNAGOGUE.
The beginning: of the Jewish '.<.- Sab
bath, on Friday evening, ' was ? chosen
for th* beginning of the \u25a0\u25a0_ outbreak.; At
eur.f et all the Jews of Jitomir.'who are
strictly orthodox, close their shops: and
withdraw from -their ordinary occupa
tions to observe the Sabbath until : sun-
Bet on Saturday. " On'- this. ':\u25a0. particular.
Friday evening about ; 3000 V Jews \ had
assembled in the largest "synagogue 'of
the city Â«nd 2000 Jew s had assembled
In another large synagogue. . Shortly
before sun*et' a dangerous rabble col
lected by, the /anti-Semitic' agitators be
gan to assemble 'at several ' points \u25a0 out;
;Â«ide the city and -at fseverali places
The San Francisco Call
within thÂ« city. In order to march by
converging routes against the Ghetto,
which Is a separate quarter of the
town. This rabble consisted of peas
ants from the surrounding villages ami
of the jscum of the urban -'population,'
which "is always ready for riot' ami
plunder. It was divided into ten-dif
ferent bands und numbered more than
7000 men: .-> â¢."â¢"'\u25a0â¢. ,' -
The large synagogue was the. first
object of their attack. First of all. the
sacred building- was surrounded, in or
der to prevent the escapo of the wor
shipers. The loaders of the mob then
hammered on the doors, -which, are
-kept locked during divine services, and
demanded admittance. Their heavy
blows on the door alarmed the.congre
gation, and monand women alike aban-'
doned.their devotions- to -gaze, terror
stricken, . in-, the direction^, from which,
the nolsecame.. Their suspensedld-not
last long. Finding .that the door
would not be opened voluntarily, the
mob rammed., it. and. broke -Into - the
synagogue without much difficulty. .
Every ' man' ! In the mob waVarmeJ
with a thick stock, while a number had
come provided "with knouts and a few
were armed with revolvers. As the-as
sailants'.poured \in through the mairi
entrance, the Jews in the synagogue
sought to escape by four other exits,
where they were met by, the remainder:
of the mob arid driven back } into the
building. The invading force .struck
their victims- \u25a0with their heavy sticks,
regardless of consequences. \
'SCENES 'OF /CARNAGE.
Horrible scenes were witnessed during
this attack. A group of Jew-baiters
beaded for the altar and belabored the
chief rabbi until he was beaten to a pulp
of unrecognizable ' flesh and bones, : The
junior rabbis who were assisting him to
conduct divine service were likewise
beaten to death. In the body, of the
synagogue men and . women alike . were
knocked down and trampled under foot

Eseclal Cable to Tha Can.
LONDON. July 15. â Only brief flyteg
visits to London the young : Countess of
Craven Is making this year, all her:ln
terests being centered In her husband's
beautiful country seat and â her chick
ens! At great poultry shows the Coun
tess and Queen -Alexandra are often ri
val exhibitors, and It is said that , her
Majesty's smiling countenance occa
sionally wears a frown when she is
beaten by the American peeress, as hap
pens with annoying frequency. Lady
Craven does not at all' come up to the
English idea of the typical American
woman who weds a titled husband. -She
is quiet and domesticated; never makes
any splurges of any sort and has no
ambition whatever to be a social leader.
She leaves that to her mother, Mrs.
Bradley Martin, who. however, notwith
standing her great wealth, has not yet
attained the position she covets. . That
gorgeously extravagant ball of. hers, in
stead of giving her the, lift up the so
cial ladder she had expected from It.
really brought her down a few rungs.
When English fashionable folk found
that -famous divines denounced it from
the pulpits, and editors wrote sarcastic
things about it. they concluded that they
would not bend the knee â¢at Mrs. V Brad
ley MaTrtln's shrine .'of wealth â particu
larly: as there are several * other rich
â¢American ..wQtcjn hers who are quite
willing- to- -accept- their "assistance : In
spending 'their .money. ââ . , .. . â¢\u25a0
,* \u25a0 ..The Bradley Martins have never . got
into \u25a0 the ; royal circle, : al though ' last year
Princess ' Christian â¢ and one "of her
daughters < went ' to one of Mrs. Bradley
Martin's . parties, and people then began
to think she had . succeeded. I heard
that Princess threw out a. . strong
hint to Mrs. Bradley Martin that one of
her favorite charities was in great need
of $3000. and that Mrs. Bradley Martin
intimated \u25a0 that she had other uses for
her money. .Princess . Christian has not
since attended any of the Bradley Mar
tin functions. People who covet, royal
favor should be prepared to pay for it.
in .. some fashion. Mrs. Bradley Martin
makes 'another mistake m wearing a
chain of diamonds over three yards long
in the park when she drives there. It
makes : 'women /who canont afford : such
displays furiously jealous and then they
say nasty,, things' about what they call
her .ostentatious vulgarity.'
Following the . example of her
Mrs. Adair. Mrs. Frank . Mackey , will
soon have a residence in Ireland. A few
weeks ago she made a hasty journey to
Dublin and -Interviewed several of : the
leading estate agents there, but * finding
nothing on their books to her liking she
went on' to Belfast.
Mrs. ' Thornton Smith of Baltimore is
also. traveling In Ireland with the view
of I finding a suitable place for herself
and family, of two* sons and three
daughters to settle down for at least
a portion of each year. Her husband
accumulated his wealth through mining
investments In California and Colorado.
Mrs. Smith is of Irish extraction, though
born in Baltimore, and the Emerald
Isle has a warm place in her affections.
Since he married Miss Goelet the Duke
of Roxburghe has 'been 'able to indulge
in his fondness \u25a0 for salmon-fishing. He
owns the fishing , rlgnta ,on some fine
stretches of water: on 'the Tweed, but
before his marriage ' he : found it ; expe
dient.to leave them to folk who were In
less need of i ready cash. Now they are
again; hi his own hands, and this season
he has had some magnificent sport.

A Japanese with, a Mauser -rifle has

another story. Professor Shuichl Ta
kaorl of the Toklo Musical College,

such a person. | Further, Professor Shojl

We have taken with resignation, if
without any particular complacence,
the Industrial and other victories of
this astonishing people. Our arts we
have hitherto considered sacred, partic
ularly the art musical. In painting we
may sometimes have doubted the su
periority of ours over the Oriental art,
not on the human side, but on the side
of sheer, absolute beauty. The superior
ity of our poetry, both In beauty and
human passion and philosophy, we have
not doubted, nor need to doubt. In music,
we smile at the comparisonâ with Bach
and Beethoven, -with our flutes and viols
and organs â what against these can the
Japanese do with his tinkling samisen
and koto, with his six-noted scale, with
only melody, no harmony? With his sim
ple 2-4' and 4-4 rhythms, with his prim
itive songs and dances handed down
from ear to ear from generation to gen
eration?
Nothing, one may answer to begin
with. But the subtle Oriental has done
here what he has done In other domains,
he has paid us the compliment of imita
tion â and gone further. He has adopt
ed our Bach and Beethoven; he has
Imported our orchestra. In Toklo to
day there is a fully equipped College of
Music for the study of "European" mu
tic, numbering 400 students, with sixty
professors, a complete orchestra of 150
Instruments, a record of 250 graduates,
fifteen preparatory schools, from which
to draw students, all subsidized by the
Government and under Government con
trol. Fifteen years ago this college
was founded, and of its Â«tudents were
Professor Takaori and Professor Iwa
moto. To-day these two pioneers of the
new invasion are giving concerts In the
very camp of the enemy â that is. they
played here last Sunday night and are
to play again.
That I was not of the audience is one
of my regrets of the week. A chat by
proxy with the two gentlemen may. how
ever, be regarded as a fairly interesting
substitute, particularly as it included
a violin recital by the way. I found the
musicians at the Imperial Hotel, just
on the Chinese edge of Xob HIIL As

was good enough to Interpret for me,
end who is acting as Impresario for
his countrymen, saldl . 'T^"."i"_"

It Is. The house, once beautiful, ver
andahed and gardened. handsomely even
yet, clings like a limpet to the side of
the hilL From It you see the whole
stretch of the bay, with the city hung
like a necklace about it.
A tiny Japanese maid met me at the
top of the steep steps. The, tinkle of
a samisen floated out on the air. The
thin fragrance of tea met one's nos
trils. In my best Japanese I asked
for Mr. Takaori. It took three little
maids of Japan, gently curious, their
colossal politeness not quite equal to
the task of concealing a smfle. to un
derstand my "Takaorl." At last Mr.
Omorl appeared, and my troubles were
ended. Upstairs we went, and out on
a verandah glassed over against the
â¢winds, where are tables at which the
guests take tea and v the view. Mr.
Takaori and Mr. Iwamoto. garbed with
religious accuracy In European clothes,
met us there. A limp, soft hand, like
the band of a queen at court, each gave
to me. and the introductions were
over.

Professor Iwamoto, "special com
missioner of the Musical College of
Toklo." etc., does not talk. He beam
his honors with extraordinary solemni
ty, his femininely oval face, slimly
mustached, relaxing- roost rarely Into
a smile. Professor Takaorl is fluent
and enthusiastic, merry and childlike
of eye and, of lively intelligence. I
should Judge them both to be about
2S years of age, Takaorl possibly the
younger.

that we began first to talk. Takaori

that these are pnld from 300 to 400 yen

"Ask him," I asked Mr. Omorl, "as :
to the repertoire. What do they play
symphonies?"
At the word Takaori looked up and
laughed. "Syniphonies," \u25a0 he. nodded,
himself answering me. "Bach. Beeth
oven," Mozart, 'Mendelssohn, . samisen.'
koto, o mimosa san" â or whatever \t
was â "Wagner."" - .
"He says," Mr. Omori elucidated,
"that they play just what other orches
tras play. Wagner, he says, is a great
favorite." \u2666, ..
"What does he himself like best?"
It was almost uncanny ... to hear, as
before, "Beethoven and Mozart" perfectly
accented, In reply. Takaorl explained to
Omori, Omorl to me, that Beethoven and
Mozart are "most sympathetic with the
Japanese sentiment of all the European
composers. The Mozart sonatas form
a large part of the violin student
repertoire. He himself played many of
them; of the Hans Sitt,. and De Berlot
concertos he played many also. ;It Is
very difficult to graduate '\u25a0 '_\u25a0 from th
college, I mutt understand. -- Of sixty
freshmen, who enter.-,'-.. generally V' only
about ten will graduate."
It was here .that -I asked to see Mr.
Takaori's violinâ perhaps '\u25a0' a little
patronizingly. He handed- it over, to
me from Its luxurious case, while Mr.
Omori told me that Takaori had given
$300 for It and that it once | belonged
to one of the college professors.
"Hut' this \u25a0is a very benutiful â¢ lnstru
rnent!" I flxclalmed Even to me. not
overfaroillar witli the violin royalty,
Mr. Takaori's instrument bore unmis
takable marks of distinction. The vio
linist could not understand; my . â¢* ques
tion as to Its maker, but smiled proud
ly at the lovely tone that answered my %
plucking: at the strings, at my evident*
admiration for the lovely line of the
purfllng.- the pale, fine gold of. the var
nish, the almost living beauty of -the
thing. <To look Inside for Ihe namw

brushed, the dust from the label this

"Amati!" I exclaimed.
"Amati," Mr; Takaori nodded."
Breathlessly I wondered then If this
person, who had dropped from ian ar
tistic Mars with an Amati under his chin,
were also a Kreisler in the handling of
it. I shouldn't have been surprised. Not
I. However, I was not to know until

Japanese music! I had suddenly re
membered, that I had been forgetting the
half -hundred questions I wanted to ask
of these musicians concerning It. What
did they think of ' It. In; the comparison
that they only are competent to make?; I
had heard some of It, myself,' chiefly from
Sada Yacco and the Japanese actors and
musicians she brought here some' five
years ago. . A delicate, graceful, but
meaningless tinkle, without end or begin
ning or climax, minor In key, .but unfa
miliar minor, and curiously primitive, the
instrumental " music had seemed to me.
The vocal musicâ shipboard hath such
sounds when peace reigneth not! Maple
Hall on that night had held an audience
of fairly polite people, as polite as' we
make 'em, and I. saw one man stuff his
gloves into his mouth because his hand
kerchief would not hold down the howl of
him. True, Mr. Otajira was singing
"comic" songs.
Japanese music? Since his graduation
four years ago Mr. Takaori has been
studying it In the public schools it Is
taught only to girls and has always so
been taught. Yes, he thought it beauti
ful. Europeans liked best the popular
musicâ the ragtime of Japanâ Mr. Taka
ori smiled a small superior smile at this,
even as you and -I. - The ancient music

"Has it our scale?" I asked, chalking
down a stave with the F sharp for the

I had spoken his tongue, and set down

accent of the playing. '. Feeling."', tempera-;

feeling, a temperament, a sentiment that
; lisps, 'stammers; a; little in Its expression
in "European" : music. Still, like .some
other, accents, it is a piquant and attract
ive quality in the music, and anything but
offensive.'. For the rest Mr. Takaori has

"The musical world of our ' country, ,

various. kinds of new tunes and airs, all I
of which unfortunately, lack refined taste '
and gracefulness. It left to , its own
course, our music will; lapse, lnto a lam
entable state. .My aeteemed friend, Mr.
Shojl Iwamoto,. recognized' the necessity'
of . rescuing our music from this . prevail
ing error by the compoeatioa study and
harmonious combination of European and
Japanese tunes. Through his encourage- .
ment,* I. have been prompted to make "a 1
theoretical study of the tunes and har- ;
mony of. our native music The result Is
the . publication of this little song. 1 en
titled 'Aklnoivokusu'. (Tinge of , Autumn
flowers). .Although It Is far from
factory both to the public as well as to'
the compoesir himself as It Is his maiden I

more than compensated, if this' little vol-;
ume should become the motive of further

neglect to Bay that Takaorl and Iwamoto
will be playing here again, or rather to-

possibly here again.' They play the r

THE ALICE
MANNER
I A CX.EVFR TOVSti MATRON WHO IS SUMMERING IN SANTA BAnBAIlA; AX- /
-OTHER WHO IS VISITING IN THE CITT. AND A DEBUTANTE WHO IS
ENJOTIXG THE SIMPLE LIFE NEAR NILES. ,
Nothing happens but leaves an effect.
Mlse Alice didn't' come among us. with
out an effect upon the gifidy throng that
Why, good friend, by a determined
swat at pese, affectation, hauteur and
ennui, all of whichâ the sins of too many
maids of the smart setâ she placed under
the tanâ and the gods T>e thanked there
fcr!
As to the qualities she asserUS, and
which ring so true, taey, are natural
nessâthe unconscious- result of whole
6ome birth and intelligent rearing; a
joyousness of manner, that infects these
about her, and which becomes a reser
voir of strength in times of social stress ;
a gay participation in the entertainments
planned for herâ a happy antithesis of
some ' maids I have known, who wear a
martyred * air when some well-meaning
but dense friend tries to entertain, for
them; and thereby boost their social
slockl .
Yes, there is a lot of wildcat social
stock. in the marketâ and no one knows
U better than the society editorâ or . the
unlucky wight that is beguiled into tak
ing the stock at its auot*d value.
Now this is what the visit of Miss Alice
should, and in due time will, prohibitâ
this seeming to be what one is not.
If a maid be of a silent^ though t ful .
prosaic, practical soul, let her appear so.
There are many men searciÂ»Â»ng for. Just
that type of girL â¢
But if a maid . be gay, loving, tender,
fond of social life, let her not appear in
the role . of Pxiscilla, for the man who
\u25a0weds her ehould be able, under the law,
ta recover under the "false pretenses"
clause of our statutes. That wasn't what,
he bargained for. Then. there's; the, type
of maid that masquerades aa "ready
money,". whose father it ; forced to run' a
.big engine with a email boiler, often
disastrous reÃUltsâ all of which "comes
from a . silly, stupid poseâ of appearing
what we are not. And THAT is the one
sin ." of . society that cries to heaven for
suppression. \u25a0\u25a0 ' ' .
And yet another thing, the exuberance
of spirit of the Nation's Pet, and her fine
enthusiasm. - \u25a0
I am Informed that some alleged "fin
ishing schools" imbue their graduates
with the belief that ! it 1Â« bourgeoise to
display enthusiasm: that a wearied air. of
complaisance contributes to -'an aristo
cratic 7 bearing; and that; a display/ of
animal spiritsâ worst' of allâ enthusiasm,
belongs to the; commonplace. ,
Fudge! What ; is â¢; youth good for, if it
isn't for its exuberance, its unreasoning
jo}\ its uolif t from" the '\u25a0 heavy ' anchors
of care, and. doubt; and reason? "
And that is why the "Alice manner"
scores. It is natural, without an at
tempt to Beem other than as one iaâtem
pered ,* of course with tact and \u25a0a â¢ kindly
heart.
And for this little lesson in manners
and- morals San Francisco is Miss Alice's
debtor. -

LONDON. July 15.â There Is an Eng
lish peerâ the Earl of Essexâ whom It
would be difficult convince- that aris
tocratic marriages with 'American = girls
are failures.* ;I â¢ have : previously \u25a0 told \u25a0\u25a0 In
this correspondence^ how the Counters
prevailed upon him to become a .London
County Councilor,' because she saw.'that
he could never cut any figure in politics
while he â¢ ies trie ted himself to merely
occupying his hereditary seat in : that
gilded abode of dignity and dullnessâ the
House of Lords. Now as part of her am
bitious scheme â¢ for â¢ his political future /
she is pushing him forward socially, and '
inducing him to cultivate friendships
; within the charmed circle of royalty, too.
Previously he had ' never shown any dla
; position to be a courtier, preferring sport '
and outdoor games to the stiffness de
manded by high society ceremonial. He
; was almost a -stranger at Buckingham
! Palace. But now-^he Is seen there : frÂ«-
I quently both at publics runctions â¢ and .in
his private capacity. He has ' become
quite chummy, too, with the Lord Cham
berlain, the Earl ..ot Clarendon, and
passes much -of his time' at the latter'a
office in the palace. More \u25a0 than one
shrewd observer has remarked . that al
though society women in America take
|no part in politics there, if the necessity
arises they speedily master all the trick j
of the game. here. The Countess of Es^
sex ,Is seeing to it tnat her husband
neglects no chance to work uj> the ' sort

LONDON, July 15.â While many menâ
lor the most part those of the old fogy
echoo! who have passed the age at which,
according to Or. Osier, they should be
chloroformed â stoutly maintain that
women are unfit for public office, women
themselves are proving their fitness when
i hey get the chance. Lady Maurice
Fitzgerald, widow of Lord Maurice Fitz
gerald, brother of the late Duke of Lein- ,
ster, has Just been unanimously re
elected for the third time chairman of
the Wexford Board of Guardians. The
position is one of considerable response
bility and requires no small amount of
administrative capacity.
Lady Maurice has been again chosen
to the office solely because she has dis
played such excellent business ability in
the management of the flnances"~of the
Wexford Union. She has shown the same
skill in the management of her hus- j
band's estate since she became a widow
four years ago. She is not the only
woman who is chairman of a Board of
Guardians in Ireland. The Hon. Mrs.
de la Poer. wife of Count de la Poer,
has been fhosen chairman of the Clon
mel Board. In the neighboring county
of Limerick, Lady Emly, the Hon. Mrs.
de la Poer's sister-in-law, has just headed
the poll in the election of Rural Council
ors and Poor Law Guardians.

THE TERROR IN RUSSIA.
"\u25a0p HE assassination of Shouvaloff seems to bring into view ; one
l feature of "The Terror", in the French revolution. \u25a0 Shouvaloff
*\u25a0 had given no provocation to any one to kill him. As Prefect
of Moscow he had used his power mercifully and his administration
was kindly. The people, with abundant grievance and grudge
against other minions of the Czar set over them, made an exception
of Count Shouvaloff and regarded him as their friend. His assas-;
sination, under such circumstances, indicates that the.revolutionary
propaganda has reached a stage with features both like and unlike
those of the French Terror.
The common feature is the purpose to shed blood, to kill, with
out any nice discrimination. Madame Roland and the Queen each
went to the knife to satisfy the blood thirst, but that was after the
convention was organized and the revolution had crystallized into
a government. France had been seized by a frenzy, and had the
instruments of government to use as the tools of slaughter. The
Russian disturbance ferments in secret. Scattered groups in secret
condemn representatives of the autocracy^to death and the. execu
tioners are selected and the terror is upon Russia. In France the
convention listened to public pleas of the accused and condemned
them openly. The members of that body, when grist was lacking",
openly threatened each other. One day when Marat entered the
chamber a member cried, "Death to Marat," and. Marat answered:
"The day Marat dies there will be no more, Paris, and the day that
Paris expires there will be no longer a republic."
One day Philloppeaux said, "A member has drawn his sword
upon me, President, call the assassin to order." The leaders, de
stroyed each other in rapid succession. They all voted to guillo
tine Louis XVI, but Robespierre lived eighteen months only; Danton
fifteen months, Vergniaud nine months, Marat five months, and
Saint-Farjean one day after that vote!
Hugo says, "The revolution is a form of the eternal phenom
enon which presses upon us from every quarter, and which we call
Necessity. Events dispense; men suffer. Events dictate; men sign.
The 14th July is signed Camille Desmoulins; 10th August is signed
Danton; 2d September is signed Marat; 21st September is signed
Gregoire; 21st January is signed Robespierre. But they are mere
scribes. The great and mysterious writer, of these pages has a
name â God; and a mask â Destiny. That which ought to happen,
happens." .-v'-
A strange mixture of faith and fatalism. But he tells us, -"In
this caldron where terror bubbled, progress fermented," and that
was true, for the convention decreed that "the liberty of each citizen
ends when the liberty of another citizen commences." It abolished
slavery and the slave trade, made the defective classes and orphans
the wards of the state, established uniform weights and meas
ures, made schooling free, and restored the public credit. A third
of its decrees were political, two thirds were humanitarian. - All
this the convention established, and then the Terror, following the
most of it, sounded the tocsin to summon the man on horseback
and he answered the call. But what would have happened had the
order of events been reversed and the Terror preceded the Assem
bly and the Convention? What then would have been written by
the pietist and fatalist?
Russian autocracy seems more rotten than was the French mon
archy. Its means of resistance seem no more. Yet there is no or
ganization, in the open, against it. But for the prowess and address
of Japan the Government would have been still taken by the world
at its* own 'estimate of itself, and the nations would have stepped
softly in fear of it. Yet the masses of the people are no deeper sunk
in ignorance and superstition than were the common people of
France. : . \u25a0\u25a0'.',
Russia has the germs of a revolution, and the terror, but there
is no public leader, no one willing to "sign" to-day and risk death
at the hands of his own followers six months hence. Until there is
such a leader and others willing to kill him and succeed him and be
killed in their turn,. it is doubtful if the revolution will get beyond
the mob stage. . â¢ '
YOUTH AND POVERTY.
THIS is the season when many kinds of counsel are being given
to young men- who pass from college training to its applications
in seizing the opportunities and bearing the disappointments
of life. The students who went out from Temple College in Phila
delphia were urged upon the strenuous life for a reason that sounds
strangely, coming as it did from a Christian minister. Rev. Dr. H.
Conwell, president of the college, warned the men he was sending
forth into life's fight that they must battle against poverty, "for it
is a curse and means slavery." .Without in any measure dispar
aging the desirability of acquiring wealth and the need of resolutely
seeking to avoid indigence, it should be pointed out that the in
structor has over emphasized in his statement of what is that im
pecunious condition against which the beginner in life is to battle,
and "never allow it to enmesh you in its thralldom."
It is rash "for any one, especially for a Christian minister, to say
that poverty is a curse. It sounds too much like an impeachment
of that providence which the church teaches positively, and the
majority of men believe probably, governs the universe. To the im
partial student of life it is at least an open question whether poverty
is not often a blessing. A blessing in disguise we may call it, but
to the wide-open eyes of even earthly wisdom the disguise is often
a very transparent veil of good that may be as strengthening to
manhood as anything that is taught in the curriculum of a' wealth v

As for the statement that poverty is slavery, there can be .no
doubt that to impress young men going out, into life with a cow
ardly dread of, and a proud contempt of, poverty is a most success
ful way to make them submissive to the meanest yokes of intellec
tual and moral slavery. The instructor of:that class, no doubt, had
a good idea which he-meant to inculcate upon the minds of his
students, but he was most unfortunate in his expression of it.
* In his long and desperate fight, it is said that the icry of Ajax
was only for light with which to see his foeman's face. JtVo con
tend strenuously against poverty is one of the things most of the
students sent' forth into life are equipped to do, but for them to
enter life's arena with the creed in their hearts that poverty is in
itself a .curse and a slavery is to start them out only half-nerved
to be heroic in the possible battles ahead of 'them. The , full light of
truth will not show them that their foeman, poverty, is either a
curse or a slavery. On the contrary it may often be that its brave
acceptance means the only way to freedom. We are to remember
how -Victor Hugo, in Les Miserables, describes how youth, after
a^ right submission to its -experience, emerges sublime. True, Â« the
trial often sinks a man, but we are to remember that there are
cases where the dread of it. have sunk man just as deep because
of the subterfuges to avoid it; though .the depth of that latter sink
ing is not so apparent as the former.
VALUE OF PUBLICITY.
RIGHTS of the layman to know all the important facts as -to
what is being, done; with the funds contributed to \u25a0charitable
/ and educational purposes are insisted upon by William H.
Allen ' in the \u25a0 North^ American Review. . He is the ; general agent/of
the. New. York Association for improving, the condition .of I the fpoor^
He shows that this duty; of giving publicity -to facts 1 has been gravely,
neglected, and that the neglect is causing harm- in ; various ways.
The trouble seemsto be not so much a" deliberate 'intention* to
be secretive arid to hold the public in ignorance, but that : ; there 'is
so little; businesslike system in the management of, educational taricl
charitable affairs that the facts cannot be readily ascertained' and :
given frequently to the people; Moreover the ; interests "of â¢ the lay man
in what is going on is toogenerally ignored, as if the concern was

He. makes no heavy: charges, and \ he is always near/: ;; ; / .- .
To serve you if you want him; his 'full: name is r Good*- Cheer.
HIS practice should be world wide and daily it "should grow; .
He serves in summer, weather. and> when^ the wild'winds blow; ;.\.
His night bell is.- in"; order, he '(answer's every, call/ â¢'.;"->'
He gives no bitter doses and tortures' not/at'a.ll,V : ' . . *

HE does not deem the wealthy more "wortliy of "his- care
Than are the poor who seek him. . Where;. walls and floors are bare
He ministers as freely as .where therich abide, *. â¢. \ ,
And all he asks in â¢payment, are hope and honest. pride, ; Â« , â¢:';'

wholly between the ; charity worker- and the beneficiaries, and confi
dences are withheld from the men and , women ', who. .make possible
philanthropic work, by ;their contributions. ' . . : .
For an instance ;he tells of the latest ;published,reportsof ;three
hospitals whose operating expenses -reach $400,000. :, These f give ! very;
complete medical statistics, but riot one of thern*tells how,; much iit
costs to support a, patient a r week, what portionvof Hhe expense r of
free beds is borne by public subsidy, nor how the "expenditures^are
divided between provisions and salaries. '? Yet in : alii of these current
expenses exceed current income. The public is "riot 'informed \ how
the money goes. The beneficence "of supporting hospitals .is more
generally believed in than that of any: other- good work, \ but the
public who are the financial backers are not considered" by the ex
ecutives. In the" big hospitals of New York whicH depend partly
on private subscription many wards are being closed forj I lack yof
funds.
Although Allen is speaking about the evils of withholding light
on charitable and educational managements," he, links this. with gen
eral inefficiency and dishonesty in public life. So long' as the phil-'
anthropist arid educator cling to those' methods of- withholding facts
and ignoring the public, thus misleading "honest, intention, while,
protecting vicious purpose and conduct," will corruption? in public
life* continue. One of ; the ways in which the. charity agent- wishes
more systematic publicity ; given is' in regard* to achievements!. '-The
public should know what it _Jis " actually .getting for its 'money inltlie,
amount of work done. Not how . many girls , the ; institutions tried
to reform, but how many they actually; did preform: How many
pupils positively benefit: by so i called "special features," arid so on.
In pther words, to ; what extent expensive good intentions \u25a0 are pro-;
ducing results for, which f the 'money' is /supposed uto; go:--

SHOPPING BY PIPE.
The "scheme authorized by \u25a0\u25a0 a bill In
Parliament to provide the whole -of
the huge . city/ of London 'with an air
tube service for the c'arrlage'of parcels
is? ambitious, v : if^not startling; yet the
marvelous development* of 'public; utlli-'
ties : in these days \ gives pause , to ' those
who V a t ;; first blush might "regard the
project of ': r the .j Metropolitans Delivery
Company, as -beyond the ';: realm " : of the

that parcels j could be j delivered anywhere

' "Impediment !'.' Y repeated the other.

"what: in ; the :is the matter ' with

broken off a tooth or burned her tongue
or - something , like , that. '
; '"Why,; auntie, nothing is the matter,'
she answered, blushing a little. 'It Is the

"That" very -tame' day I called on a
friend, whose; daughter was -married in
Easter ... week, and to my astonishment ; I
noticed a slight lisp, so slight that it was
hard ito locate. or deflne.it, running all
through her. talk. I was so fascinated and
interested in trying to make but how she
did it that ,1 kept her talking all the
time, staring meanwhile at her mouth.
"I had about come : to the conclusion
that occasionally . she , gave : a little twist
to the i end of her tongue, sending 'It
against her; lower teeth, when she broke
off suddenly with: '\u25a0'

Thirteen is supposed by superstition
to be an unlucky number. The greatest
marine painter of the United States has
boldly dencd if.o hoodoo by making- his
soricF of (M picture*, whioh is the chief
work of his life, number a baker's
dozen. Over the waters in the picture
â¢vvhirh is prelv.de to the series, a glimpse
of the ocean, hover thirteen gulls.
About iliis scries, which cost the artist
lifteen years of work, a !>ook has been
written with Uae necessarily lons title
of â¢Thirteen Chapters of American His
tory: HcprcsT.tfd by the Edward Aloran
Seri, -s of Thirteen Historical Marine
Fair.tinj?s." The book is written by
Theodore Sutro, a Jswyor of New York,
end there is a little story about why he
did it. Hiv wlf.-. Florence, had a strong
friendship for, iir. and Mrs. Edward Mo
ran, sr.dwhea the artist died and there
Vac litigation tor the possession ofthc
valuable canvases. Sutro was led by
this friendship to champion the rights
L of the widow. He won. So he dedicated
Afv.e volume to his wife. It is a pretty
7 book, both in text and illustration, and
an ambitious woman might well be
proud of having befriended the artist
and inspired the eloquent descriptions
of his work.
Six of the series illustrate great
events in American history; six of them
remind us of our navy's progress; one
of them, the thirteenth if you count
backward, is the prelude to the series.
It is ooean. Nothing else there to dis
tract. These pictures are kept on exhi
bition fit the Metropolitan Museum of
Art. The Xew York Herald considers
Kdward iloran as probably the strong
est marine painter of the United States,
and that no more artistically valuable
find educationally instructive exhibit
has been made in New York than these
Works. Moran lived to be 72. His
power did not begin to wane at mid-life,
as is so often the case, but culminated
IK this historical series, the last of his
achievements, and produced under a pa
triotic impulse.
Sutro makes thirteen chapters of his
book, each one descriptive and explana
tory of one picture. The paintings are
reproduced in half-tone on tinted paper.
The reason why the artist chose the
number thirteen hardly needs explana
tion; but as all of it may" not be remem
bend offhand, here it briefly is: Thir
teen original States,' thirteen warships
were first ordered for our navy's begin- ',
nins; thirteen stars were on* the first
flag; thirteen bars still are there; thir
teen arrows are in our eagle's talon:
February 13 our flag was first reeog-
J nized by a foreign Government; and
thirteen years after the declaration of
independence came the inauguration of
our first President.
The first painting is the largest, and by
tome critics considered the best. Ad
miral Hopkins of the British navy said
of it: "I had to come to America to look
upon the most almighty sea that I have
ever beheld on canvas." The color is the
gray-green that is peculiar to times when
the sky is overcast. The only sunlight
teen is in the distinctly rayed form of
that which breaks through the clouds.
The water is in foaming motion, but
something less than tempestuous. The
author likens the picture to the opening
Ftanzas of an epic poem to which the
\u25a0whole series of great paintings is a de
piction. Its historic place in the series is
- to tell us of the ocean before man had
crossed it. Of course when we vent
grand, rolling words to say to ourselves
about such a scene we remember those
we learned by heart In boyhood's days
from Childe Harold.
The second Is of the landing of Uef
Eilckson in the new world in 100 L His
chip is anchored out Just dimly far
enough to make the figure of Erickson. as
he stands close to a boat load of his fol
lowers but himself in shallow water and
abtiut to step upon the shore, the most
remembered feature. He makes a gigan
tic, heroic presence, as with sword and
chieid raised aloft he seems to be making
eume appeal or promise to ueayen in re
gard to the new land his feet are soon
to touch.
The third is of the three frail barks in
which Columbus dared the ocean voyage.
The Santa Maria, Nina and Pinta. It is
evening of October 11, I<?2. the day before
the landing. The best thing to say about
these sister chips is to quote what the
eloquent Spaniard, Emillo Castelar, wrote
(of that eventful day: "Lanal Land! the
cry fell as a Joyous peal upon the ears
of these mariners who had given them
eelves up as lost and doomed to die In
tte fathomless vast. When Columbus
heard the glad cry be knelt in rapture on
tbe deck and with clasped bands lifted
his Joy-fllled eyea to heaven and Intoned
- the 'Gloria in Excelsis' to the author of
all things."
The fourth picture shows the debarka
tion of Columbus. The boats are pictured
as just leaving the ships and Columbus is
holding an uplifted cross. The pages of
history are one way of Immortalizing this
event. The artist also conserves the
great event vividly la the memory by this
spirited painting.
The fifth picture is of midnight mass
on the Mississippi over the body of Fer
dinand de Soto, In 1542. It Is a thing of
majestic gloom. A little moonlight,
partly clouded, mingles with tbe flaring
light of the torches to light up the boats
which are grouped in the midst of the
river. Centrally In the picture is the
white-shrouded corpse, all ready to be
lowered into the water. There are chant-
Ing priests, holding up a large cross. De
Soto had been hunting Eldorado, and
this was the end. His beautiful wife,
whom he had left in Cuba, died broken
hearted. "Never was there, all in all, a !
more tragic ending to an expedition com
menced amid so much pomp and glory." |
The firth Is of Henry Hudson enter-
Ing New York Isay, September 11, 1609.
It Is a combination of landscape, ma
rine and figure painting. An Indian
and his are watching from thÂ«s
shore. They regard Hudson's ship as
an Intruder upon their domain. To de
pict the surprise, fear and Jealousy of
the natives seems \u0084 to have been the
object of this picture. The Indians are
In the foreground, with their tepee and
their dog near by; probably this Is to
add to our realization of the feelings
of the natives about the approach of
thie new and unknown peril to their
homes. A lenscn of tbe event thus pic
tured is (hat Hudson, who was seek
ing to discover a road to Asia, did a
greater thing than he intended. Hla
tory proves that such result is often i
reached by great intention* . energet
ically acted out. and it Is a pretty phil
osophy to bÂ»lieve that this Is always
60, though we do not always see the
ends of all iht moves.
The seventh Is of thÂ«Â« embarkation of
the pilgrims f;-oni Southampton,, on
August 5. I<s2<Â». The artist has elect
ed that the chief feature of this should
be the. sadness yf the friend* left be-,
hind ~s tli. y \.:i\c farewell to the May

date was the 13th. This proves that
there i.s nothing dreadfully ominous In
â¢an unlucky number provided there be
a hero on deck daring enough to outdo
the hoodoo.
The ninth is the most beautiful pic
ture of all. It .s the Durning of the
frigate Philadelphia in the harbor of
Tripoli, February IG, ISO 4. Lieutenant
Decatur, -ifterv/ard commodore, exe
cutÂ«-d thÂ«Â«^ perilous tas-k. The pirates
had lured the ship upon the rocks nnd
captured her. Later, when she had
been carried m the harbor under thÂ«
guns of the shore batteries, seventy
four American volunteers boarded her
and, after a furious battle, either killed
or drove iiito the sea all the Tripolltan
crew. They tlu*ix set fire to the ship
and escaped. The picture is of "tho
mounting flames against the moonless
and midnight Pky.N.* " with dense
masses of smoko rising to the extreme
height of the painting and a shower of
burning crr.bers descending into thÂ«j
water."
Tho effec.t is/said to be so vivid and
rcalirtlc of a sreat conflagration that
the eye Is rivtted to the scene with
never-failing "nterest.
The tenth picture is of the brig Arm
strorg engaging the British fleet in
the harbor of Fayal, September 26, 1814.
It commemorates a heroic exploit of
Captain Samuel Chester Reed, In which
he displayed unexcelled iightlnsf quali
ties and had success in repulsing over
whelming numbers.
The eleventh has a fascinating kind of
terrible beauty. It is of the Confederate
Merrimac. called by them "The Virginia."
sinking: the Cumberland. That was in
Hampton Roads, March Bth, 1862. It was
the first naval conflict of Iron against
wood.
The twelfth is the white squadron's
farewell salute to the body of Captain
John Ericsson, In iNew York bay,. Aug
ust 25, IS9O. It honors the inventive
genius of the engineer, which clad "the
wooden navies of the world In impene
trable iron and steel."
The thirteenth Is called "The Return
of the Conquerors." It typifies f our vic
tory in the late Spanish-American war,
September 29, 1599. It is a pageant, and
a grand one; and seems to defy all dan
gerâeven that of being the thirteenth
picture. (Copyright by the author.- New

A NEW HISTORICAL WORK BY
PRUT Z OF KONIGSBERG.
The ninth volume of "A History of All
Nations," edited by Henry Wright of
Harvard University, is just out. It con
cerns "The Age of Feudalism and Theoc
racy," and is written by Hans Prutz,
professor of history in the University of
Konlgsberg. The same author wrote the
previous volume which gave a history of
Charlemagne and the establishment of
the Holy Roman Empire. The present
volume is divided into three booksâ the
age of the conflict of the in
vestitures; the. empire and the papacy in
the age of the Hohenstaufens; the trans
formation of Western Europe through
the decline of the papacy and the empire.
The. volume has 176 illustrations and 16
plates, some of which are colored. The
period covered is from A. D. 1056 to 1328.
The first book contains an account of the
reform of the hierarchy of the medieval
church through Gregory VII, and the
revolution of the princes In Germany;
the. conflict between the church and the
empire brought about by the antagonism
of the leaders of the church to lay inves
titure, or the granting of benefices by
secular rulers; France and England from
the middle of the tenth to the end of the
twelfth century: the Mohammedan
world, the Byzantine empire and the first
Crusades. A notable chapter" in the sec
ond book is the one concerning Frederick
I, Barbarosea; another tells of Chris
tianity and Mohammedanism from the
middle of the twelfth to the end of the
thirteenth centuries; and the book ends
with a treatise on the influence of
crusades on western civilization. One of
the subjects of the third book is the over
throw of Boniface VII and the papacy by
Phillip IV of France, . 1270-1314; the'vol
ume closes with the conquest of the Mon
gols and Turks, the. downfall of the
Calif ate, and th<* decline of the Byzantine
empire.: -
Probably the, most interesting; por
tion of this history to. the genera! read
er will be the account of the great Hil
debrand, afterward Pope Gregory \u25a0 VII,
and his contest for supremacy .with
Henry IV, the German Emperor. Long
before Hildebrand became Pope he was
practically the controlling power^in
the Roman church. When- there ,were
three Popes In the field the decision of
Hildebrand was that - Nicholas II was
the right Pope and the arms of God
frey of Lorraine secured his triumph.
Complete vindication is given .to the
character of Hildebrand againsf^the
old charge that; he was an intriguing,
ecclesiastical adventurer, actuated ;by
selfish worldllness: The great ecclesi
astic was In solemn, v earnest In .-main
taining what he believed: to berthe dif

enforce these on a resisting worldiwas
the command of heaven, he; had ; no

character and ability of ' Ilildebrand
and the elevation .to-pbwer;. which .the
policy originated by him lifted the

churchman as -causes .-.of- that church's'

able energy. He is to be praised for
the merit of, beginning that great
movement which succeeded in emanci
pating the church from the authority
of the state. ! Later he contended that
the state should be subordinated to the
church and tliat such order of things
was willed of God. The historian ex
plains his wonderful growth In power
until, as Gregory VII, he is able to
compel the submission of the Emperor,
who Is kept waiting two days in an
outer court before he is granted audi
ence and permission to bend his knee
to the pontiff. That is one of the most
dramatic events in" history and It and
its causes and' consequences are ably
narrated for us by this German his

UNKNOWN MAKES A PLEA FOR
UNITY OF THE CHURCH.
An author who prefers to conceal his I
identity/has written a book called "The
Church of Christ," 'in. which he makes a
strong plea for the unity of that church.
He gives no hint as to who he" is be
cause he wishes the ideas and arguments
in | his work - to be - considered from the
standpoint of their intrinsic worth, and
freed from any reference, to the particular
mind that produced them. -He ", has di
vided the volume into two books, -, "The
History of Pardon," and "The \ Evidence
of : Pardon â¢ and The Church as Â£an \u25a0 Or
ganization." He uses much of * his â¢ force
to make clear thecontrast of Christianity
to, all preceding religions. .It IsLoriginai
and It is adapted to be universal.'- He says
that it is new in promising forgiveness of
sins," in promising eternal: life, in teach
ing the fatherhood: of.; God, and in being
positive. ; Among : the contents is'quite an
elaborate study of pardon. Itl is pointed
out'that when Christ was- on the earth
he -pardoned unconditionally; .but 'after
that 'the terms of pardon are laid (down
and must be compiled with.:;. They are to
believe, to repent, and to v = be \baptized.

TRUE STORY OF A NEW YORK
BUSINESS MAN'S LIFE.
A very plainly told stop-, the true story
of, a ; business man's,; life in New York,
holds the; interest fairly taut throughout
its "24o pages, which relate "the romance
and tragedy: of a 'widely known business
man of New .York," by himself. ;It is
written by. William Ingraham Russell and
tells of his business career under the firm
name of W. E. Stowe & Co. :â¢ In his pre
face to his readers: he says: "Why is.lt
written? To 4bear testimony to the "love
and devotion of a noble woman; to set
straight before the world certain matters
now misunderstood ; to give evidence of
the insincerity of frinedship that comes
to one in prosperity only to vanish in
adversity; and also, that an appreciative
public will buy' the book." The frontis
piece of the little volume Is a. picture of
bis wife, and has' under it.tne title "The
Woman." - She | was notably among those
the sincerity of whose friendship did not
vanish in adversity.

commission merchant's life.". Â« The motto
of it might well.be, this: "Adversity is
worth undergoing . in order to find out
who are one's true' and who. only one's
seeming friends." : The \u0084love story that
runs through the ; book .(Russell and his
wife have been sweethearts for' thirty
two years) has_ all the pleasing of a beau
tiful thing simply told. It Is probably no
more than the usual love story of thous
ands of -men who are happily- married
and the devotion of > whose wives have
been put to the; proof by days of disas
ter.; It is the old,; old story that never
tires, however: Frankly and simply as a
buy" he tells of the first letter he received
from ithe girl when he was wooing her,
but' she had been withholding her de
cision and counting him only friend. :He
noticed J that . there were three .significant
points in \u25a0\u25a0that note: ' '.'.' First, ifcommenced
with .'Dear Walter.' Nyxt it was signed
as 'Yours, with love'; and last.but by no
means least^ Miss Wilson .wrote, as a
postscript; 'I*. shall, be alone.'"
Knowing that : his j parents would ' ob
ject to' his; leaving; school, the author,
calling himself Stowe, : obtained a posi
tion as office boy,at*3; per week.'- From
thai he went up tolbuslness on his 'own
account and was making $70i/0 a week.
Then .when ; he "v lost."; S5OOO ,of : that ~ bV
speculating; and had to count $2000 net
profit and $5000 : invested in , experience."
he thought : it /was "a : i heart-breaking
calamity and had to '-I brace up ". on'his
wife's \u25a0 cheerfulness. : Later . his ; Income
â¢began *to go up â¢ by/ bounds. Ten . thou

BEAUTIFUL IN FICTION; BUT
Yr iNLIFEiUNWIiACfIVE;:
.A, very/ prettily .written > little ; story Is
Mrs/; Hugh'Fraser's "A; Maid of Japan. 'â¢
It telis of the love of an Englishman for
a Japanese maid and his romantic mar-,
rlage with her, not just for a summer, as
such idyls usually are, but love for keeps
and permanent marriage. Such tales can
by the skill of a writer be given quite
a fairy-like glamour of romance, but it
13 necessary In- order, to keep the im
pression upon the mind beautiful to think
of it just as a fairy-land . story and res
olutely deny it a place among stories that
are true to life. Such a thing could not
i possibly please our fancy if It actually
' happened." It is one of ' those peculiar
I things which are fair In fiction but would
disgust us in real life. If such fiction
as this, backed up by even such facts
as of Sir Edwin Arnold and of Lafcadio
Hearn loving and marrying Japanese
women, could possibly blind us to the
truth that in the realities of things
miscegenation is abomination, then the
multiplication of such fiction should be
frowned away and discouraged. Let us
then transport the love fancy into a land
wholly of imagination and remote from
that real world wherein we know that
mongrellsra is detestable. Then we may
enjoy the charm of the Illusion. Here Is
the love story of the young Englishman.
Barrinston, who meets the Japanese
maiden, a shell gatherer, on the shore.
They are attracted to each other by sing
ing the same music:
"Not the sun, but the summer moon
seemed to have given ' him ; Hlme, the
ilsland child, as pure and perfect as any
flower of nature's handiwork. Night,
after night he had sailed to the embow
ered cove, thinking of her as the breezo
brought him nearer, loving her more as
each, daffodil-tinted dawn lighted- him
back to his home.. She had never failed
him;' not once had hl3 greeting of song
died away unanswered over the lessen
ing spaces of the ' watery way. C Then
came the joy of seeing, her standing
where the wavelets broke round her feet,
her arms outstretched, and ' his welcome
shining in her eyes: the hours of un
speakably ' sweet companionship, when
the untutored girl answered his thought
almost as ; quickly, as his speech; the un
trammeled isolation/ of their strange
friendship, whose . name was unrevealed
to" Hime t yet. It was .all so divine, so
true to the best in man and woman, that
Barrington knew these perfect days of
June In Japan, these dreams of a few
short summer nights, would - stand out
as the most unfading reality, of life when
life Itself should be passing, away."

ODDS AND ENDS OF INTEREST
TO THE WORLD OF LETTERS?
In the. Country Calendar for July,
W. H. Irwin writes as follows: . . '
"Every August, on the Saturday night
nearest full moon, the Bohemian Club
of fan Francisco packs up and travels
to^ Us own grove in the California,
woods to hold a festival unicue In this
country, and, indeed, in the world â thÂ«
'midsummer hig-h jinks' they call it la
brief, it consists of a big â spectacle,
with all accessories of poetry and
music, in praise of the forest.
"In all the West there la no grove
more beautiful. The only other which
may be iairly compared to it is the
Big- Basin of Santa Cruz Mountains,
lately set aside by the State of California
as a forest rt serve."
Of course, all our French writers of
to-day are not indecent, but I must
acknowledge that most of our modern
writers, unlike those of England and
America, have almost entirely' aban
doned the sentimental novel, to devot*
themselves to illegitimate love in all
its phase*. I mignt add that a large
number, also, make a far too realistic
and too attractive picture of vice: that
the "naturuliste" school has been a lit
tle too prominent of late years, and.
finally, that certain French writers
have manifested an unhealthy talent for
depicting and exaggerating the hidden
side of Parisian life. But, happily for
our mora.l and for our literary excel
lence, , these writers are in the small
minority. We have a brilliant circle
of authors who hold it their duty to
defend our literary prestige and who
are proving worthy of their task.
Why- is it that the very books a
French woman would not admit to her
home must be the ones that find their
way across the ocean into the homes
of American women, who half the time
do not understand them, but upon
whom they leave a most deplorable im
pression of our French literature? I
have searched in vain for an explana
tion. Here Is the only possible one: As
a rule, the publishers bring 1 oat a larger
edition of their immoral novels, and
evidently they prefer such to form tho
greater part of what they call "litera
ture d'exportation."â From "Some French
Books that American Women Ought to
Read," by Stepbane Jousselln hi tha
American Monthly Review of Reviews
for July.

A short story entitled. "The End of
the Journey," which appeared In Har
per's Magazine for May, has been made
tbe suhject of general and enthusiastic
comment. Several eminent authorities,
among: them the veteran editor cf the
Magazine hircself, have pronounced the
little study, in which much of the skill
lies in what is cot said, representative
of the highest point that has been
reached in the development of the short
story. This i 3 but another Instance co
ing to prove Mr. Howell's contention
that the short story is an American
product, and that the masters of 'the
art at the present day are Americans,
for the author of this story. Grace El
lery ChannlnsT, is an American, a gr~aad
daughter of the Rev. William Ellery
Channingr. She was born in Providence,
R. T.. and lived there and In California
until her .marriage to Charles Walter
Stetson In 1534. She has spent a sum-:
ber of years In Italy, studying and writ
ing of the Italian poor, and has pub
lished several books. She Is. however,
best known forNher short stories, which
have appeared in Harper's and other
periodicals.

SENDS A POISONED
ORANGE TO EIVAL
Minnesota Maiden Is Arrest-
ed for Attempt to ICill
Pretty Widow.
OWATONNA,. Minn., July 15.â Wilda
Johnson, a young woman, is under ar
rest, charged .with having put poison, in
to a well on the farm of G. L.. Johnson,
and with having sent a package contain
ing strychnine .to Mrs. Lundstrom, , a
daughter of Johnson, who is a teacher
in the county school. According to the
prosecution Miss Johnson was desperately
in love with a young man of the. neigh
borhood. She is Bald to \ have become
jealous of Mrs.. Lundstrom, who. is a
young widow and; with the idea; of get
gting her out of the way she is. charged
with sending poisoned . oranges to the
school with a note saying it was "for
teacher, only." The oranges were laid
aside and having failed ; in this direc
tion, the girl is alleged to have poisoned
the Johnson -well. Fortunately no one
drank of the water and. the alleged crime
was discovered . before any . disaster â¢ re
sulted. A sample of the water , was sent

City 0 Officials' Conference
Brings Discovery That

COWDEN OBELLIGEEENT
Long Discussion Over Actual
Amount of Debris Comes to
'Naught and Case Goes Over
After two' hours of bitter wrangling:,
during which 7 the lie was passed -and
much loud talk Indulged Jn. the' Super
vsors' joint Committee on Streets and
FinaiicG aixd tlioiJoard of Public Works
-arrived attbe remarkable conclusion at
a conference yt-sterday that the
are in ;a V filtiiitr,' condition than , they
ever were before. -The discovery, :ls far
'from: being- a liew one, the ; city's naif t.
million . Inhabitants \u25a0 having been ', pain :
fully.'awiire ot the fact for a week past.'
Bui the "conclusion arrived- at officially
was the sum; total of the/result of .the:
conferencrj and in the 'meantime the
streets are. eviin. a little 1 lilt hier than
when. the discusFion was begun: ';<
Proceedings were opened when r J. B.
Cowden, supi-rintendent of street
swe*Â»plnpr, siatud that some of the team-;
steVs furnished by A^ B. Clutu, who was
awarded ; th e f.- ni tract . by thu Board of
supervisors, : whose power is disputed in
the Board of \u25a0 Works, had xonÂ«f ! ho.^6
with tht.*ir teams, claiming that they are
municipal employes and would not work
Saturday 1 alternoon, . which -is . a half
holidfiy according to law. .. - ;
"Sorr 1 c of the .sweepers have been lala
off owing' to the accumulation.of. sweep-;
ings." said Cowden. ""We will have to
stop sweVipiiig" laltogether1 altogether and do th.;
work 'with fluahers. Thore are ,about :
l'2O loads 6l" refuse oil the" streets to â¢ bo

to-morrow evening if the teams work."
Cojni'.ilssloner. of AVorks .i.'agan\here'
interposed that there' v/ere. between 600
and SOO loads ot re-fuse, which would
take one week to haul away. Eagan's
estimate was based on a statement
'.maue by Inspector J. N". Copus the day
before. / â¢ \u25a0
'says' statement isa Lie.
"The- statement that there" are .more
than 000 loadson the rftreuts is a notori
ous lie. and/the man who made it .knew
that > it was," < said Cowdon, prising
angrily from his seat. "If tho Board of
Works orthe yuperylsors think I am'a
plitty .man ! thoy^are mistaken." If: the
Inspectors were" attending" to- their
duties, instead , of hanging; around the
Clty^HnJli, the^v'ork would bo done bet

to-day reached the highest number of
the muiiuer, tor there were tv\ enty-one
\lctlm*. - ,
This Is accounted for on the score
that the constant humidity had weak
cued the constitutions of many persons,
who finally succumbed to the climatic
condition. The fatal cases were con
fined largely to infants and to persons
cf advanced age â less than a year old
or more than sixty. The fatality among
the babies in Brooklyn, a borough
which is supposed to be much cooler
than Manhattan, was especially large.
There was less humidity than early
in the week, owing to the circulation of
air currents. The thermometer at 6
o'clock this morning registered 74 de
grees and at noon reached its maxi
mum, 89 degrees. The humidity began
with 7S per cent and decreased until it
reached 51 at noon. Most-of the'-hea.t
prostrations occurred before noon to
day. The wind, from the northwest,
was blowing at a rate of from eighteen
to twenty-six miles throughout the day^
and toward night It freshened still
more.
Out on the water the" weathe*Â» was
delightful, but those who stepped
ashore into West street from the boats
arriving from the New Jersey resorts
encountered a furnace-like heat.
Weather prophets scanned the sky
for signs of rain, but the sun sank
without a shower. St. Swithln's day,
July 15, therefore, passed into metero
logical history as dry. This means, if
old sayings cut any figure, that for the
next forty days there will be cloudless
skies.

Epedal DiEjatch to The Call.
STOCKHOLM, July 15. â Sweden's dis
solution conditions, now in course of
preparation, will possess all the force
of an ultimatum, according to Captain
Bauingarten, wbc introduced in the Up
per house the resolution to appropriate
100.000.00 D kroner ($26,8000,000) for use
in an emergency. The captain has led
the influential party in a strenuous light
against the separation of the countries.
"When the Xliksdag has decided on
the dissolution terms," said the captain
to-day, "they- will represent the coun
try* Irreducible minimum from the
standpoint of national honor. Their re
jection will give us no 'alternative ex
cept war. The Riksdag is determined ,
that the crisis shall leave no blemish
on Sweden's escutcheon.
"With the ex^-spUon" of the Socialists,
the country solidly .upholds this atti
tude. The King will not oppose it when
the steadfastness of the nation's atti
tude Is manlftFt Sweden can put
100.000 effectives In to the field a' week
after the declaration of hostilities and
Norway can put only 45,000. Sweden
could maintain tbÂ« same' rate o( pre
ponderance throughout the war."
In the lower house of the Riksdag this
afternoon the Minister of Justice an

of the Norwegian Cabinet., by omitting
In the statement appearing in the Storth

the Rmsdag that Premier . Michaelson
gave the correct version of the . rescript,
but Herr Berner, the President of the
Storthing, omitted the faial word in read

To-night both houses of the Riksdag
were holding secret sessions, discussing

LEXINGTON. Ky., July 15.â 1n a des
perate feud battle near Lee City, on Hol
ley Creek,: in Wolfe County, this after
noon, Frank Smith and his two sons,
William and Manfred Smith, aged re
spectively 22 and 20 years, were shot and
killed. Their slayer is alleged to have
been Scott McQuinn. leader of the Mc-
Quinn faction in the McQuinn-Smith feud,
which has existed in that county since
the killing of Meredith McQuinn by Wil
liam Smith several years ago.
The shooting to-day was witnessed by
only one man. he being John Lane, a
brother-in-law of McQuinn. and all the
details known are what .he and McQuinn
have related. The two men say that
they were riding along the road when
accosted by the Smiths. During- the
quarrel which followed the elder Smith
attempted to draw his revolver, and Mc-
Quinn fired with a repeating rifle. '
After the firing had ceased Smith* the
father, and his con, Manfred, were dead
â¢in-iUie- road, with several bullet wound*
in -the body of each. while~Wllliam Smith
fell dead In a field. He was shot In the
head, chest and stomach.
Frank Smith, one ofthe dead men, was
a brother , of "Jeff" â¢ Smith, "who was : a
witness -' for S the -commonwealth ; in .the
recent, trial ' of - James ; Hargis, I County
Judge of Breathitt County, at Lexing
ton, for the .murder of James Cockrell.
While that trial was in progress, "Jeff-
Smith received several warnings , that he
had better not take the stand against
Judge Hargis, or- he or members of his
family might pay the penalty.
Lane and McQuintT were placed under
arrest, but neither would give further de
tails of the killing. It is believed to-night
more bloodshed will follow, as all
the men are prominent in the county, and
have friends and relatives who will take
up the fight for them.

PORTLAND, July 15.â The motion for
a new trial of the case of United States
Senator John H. Mitchell was overruled
by Judge de Haven in the United States
Court this afternoon and the attorneys
for the defense asked for a week in
which to file a bill of; exceptions and
writ of error. Senator Mitchell was
not present in court. .
Judge de Haven announced that he
had been too busy to prepare a written
reply to^ the motion and gave a: verbal
decision. The motion for arrest of

late Judge Bellinger, and while he be
lieved j that the > court had -Jurisdiction

the plea in abatement, he did: not' feel

that she had been forced,: through her

COLONEL GREENE STYLES
TUSTIN A KATTLESN AKE.
Arizona Capitalist
Sues Former
Treasurer.
Latter Says "Bill"
Is a Prince of
UlUllCto.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CaU.
NEW TORK. July "15.-â Winiam'C
Greene, president and one of the larg
est stockholders of tbe Greene Con-
Bolidated Copper Company, has just
begun a suit in the Supreme Court to
recover $:00,Â«74 from Edward B. Tus
tin. former treasurer of the various
Greene companies. He says that in
December last they signed an agree
ment by which- Tustin was to carry
60C0 shares of the stock of the com
pany until the market price should
reach $50 a share, when he was to sell
the stock, and out 'of the proceeds
* Greeny should be paid $100,000, all
other interest in the stock or proceeds
to belong: to Tustin. f
Greene charges that Tustin has at
tempted to dffeat the purposes of the
agreement. He also charges that Tus
tin has circulated false and slanderous
reports concerning his management
and conduct of the business of the com
pany, which directly affected thÂ«. mar
ket price of the stock and caused it to
remain at a low figure. He asks that
the agreement between them be set
BJEldfl and that he have judgment
against Tustin for the full amount of
his claim against him.
Following the suit in court Colonel
Greene has declared war on Tustin In \
flnancJal circles. In the most famous '
circular to stockholders ever issued in
Wall street. Colonel Greene, in graphic
language, describes his former col
league cs a "rattlesnake" and "bank
rupt in health, fortune, reputation and
friendship."
He adds that his enemy is deluded,
unfortunate and something worse, that !
few newspapers would care to print, j
Colonel Greene, however, signs himself
"Respectfully. W. C. Greene. President,"
to the circulars in which the striking
language is used. The circulars are
addressed to the stockholders of the
Greene Consolidated Company.
Colonel Greene was seen as he was
leaving his office to-day. He was :t
trifle nervous for a man who has three
notches in his gun and who swore
vengeance against Thomas W. Lawson,
the Boston man. who cost him at least
52.00rt.000 last December when the cop
per break came.
"I have nothing to add to my state
ment to the stockholders." he said.
All Wall street was talking about the
developments to-day. The curb mar
ket was In a state of confusion.
Tustin sayÂ« he is glad the colonel is
"\u25a0suir.K him, for he will now have a
chence to show him.' â¢*" "â¢ *
"If I am an unfortunate and deluded
individual and a rattlesnake, 1 * eatd
Tustin, "I am going to show the world
that Colonel 'Bill' Greene is the greatest
bluffer that Wall street has ever seen.
This suit will bring out some of the
greatest senealions that Wall street has
seen for some time, not excepting the
Montreal and Boston scandal.
'.'Colonel 'Bill' has a placer mine in
Labrisca, Mexico, which, he says, is
producing $40,000 or more gold a month.

to send a representative to the 'peace con

treaty binding, if its provisions affecting
Chinese- territory were regarded as pre
judicial, was sent;to all the powers in the
form of a circular note. Russia, accord
ing: to the Foreign Office, sent no reply. to
Peking.' but" it may be significant { that
some papers which occasionally have of
ficial inspiration, like Prince Ouktomsky's
Vledoraosti.. look/ with, complaisance, if
not" satisfaction, upon .the .prospect . that |
China may. try to have, a voice in the
terms of .peace. \ Â£ .-,/.
: Their argument is that any action on
China's . part /will,' necessarily -be in the
direction of restricting Japan's /war spirit."
and that the other powers, especially the
United States, , in of the prin
ciples of Chinese territorial integrity will
be compelled, to a greater or 'less extent,
to support the Chinese .claims:' /.
The Shanghai/ correspondent of "a Rus

TRIES TO KILL HIMSELF.
Fires Bullet. From Re
volver Through His
Left Lung.
Tries to Make His Wife
Believe a Robber
Shot Him.
Illness of Ten Years'
Duration Produces
Despondency.
Ex-State Senator Eugene F. Bert, at
torney at law and president of the Pa
cific Coast Baseball League, attempted
to end his life with a bullet yesterday
morning. The affair -was at first sur
rounded \u25a0with a great deal of mystery,
but the reason finally given by relatives
and friends is that the attorney was de
mented from illness and preferred death
to an operation which he considered In
evitable. Bert may recover, but as the
leaden missiJe passed entirely through
cne lung, the chances are greatly against
him.
The ex-Senator attempted to destroy
his life in the kitchen of his home at
IC2^ California street. No one else was
present in the room at the time, but his
wife, attracted by the shot, ran quickly
to the scene. At first Bert was con
vdous and told a story of being shot by
a robber. This story was quickly proven
flimsy by the fact that the revolver
from which the bullet was fired belonged
to the injured man. The house was also
locked from the inside and there was no
possibility of any outsider being respon
sible for the deed. When Mrs. Bert real
ized what had happened, she telephoned
immediately to Andrew J. Clunie and an
effort was made to hush the matter up.
The police were not notified and it was
agreed, if the wounded man did not die,
they should be kept in ignorance.
TALKS OF A ROBBER.
During the day, however, the story
leaked out and Captain of Detectives
Burnett detailed Detective Ed. Gibson
to make an Investigation. Mrs.Bert ex
pressed much surprise when the officer
visited her and finally agreed to make
a statement. She said that her husband
had been awakened shortly after 7
o'clock in the morning by a noise on the
rear porch. He immediately arose and
started out to investigate. A few mo
ments later. Mrs. Bert averred, she heard
a pistol shot and when she rushed to
the kitchen she found her husband stag
pering about, his nightgown on fire and
blood rushing from a wound in the left
breast.
Bert is alleged to have said "Ha shot
me!" upon seeing his wife. Mrs. Bert
said she heard the noise of the alleged
robber as he ran down the rear stairway
to the yard and then out through a nar
row allej'way. Gibson took little stock
in the story and started an investigation.
TCo one on the premises had seen or
heard the robber escape and every parti
cle of evidence that could be secured
tended to prove that the attorney had
tried to kill himself.
Mrs. Bert stuck to her story and her
husband was in such a condition that

SONS. WHO SHOT HIMSELF. PROBABLY FATALLY.
the bond and warrant derK was refused
admission to ,the room to take a dying
statement. Several friends of the family
visited the house during the day. but
they remained reticent and referred all
who inquired to the tale told by Mrs.
Bert.
CLUXIE MAKES STATEMENT.
Last evening Andrew J. Clunie ap
peared at the Hall of Justice and offered
to tell Chief Dinan and Captain Burnett
all he knew. Clunie axplained that Bert
had either shot himself intentionally or
that the pistol had gone off accidentally.
He said the weapon had been secured for
Bert by Sig Simon and that the pawn
broker who sold it could easily Identify
it. As a reason for suicide Clunie said
that Bert had been in ill health for the
last ten years. He was under treatment
by a local physician, who is at present in
Europe, and was only awaiting the lat
ter's return to have an operation per
formed. .... , . _
For the Jast few months Bert has
grown rapidly -worse. and his suffering
has been intense. He has been unable
to sleep and frequently fell to the floor
from pain and loss of strength. About
one month ago one of Bert's friends,
who -was similarly afflicted, told him of
the tortures of the operation. Bert
brooded when he _heard this and on
July 6 asked a friend of his. Sig Simon,
to secure him a revolver. Simon asked
Bert what he wished the weapon for
and the ex-Senator replied that he was
going to spend a few days in the coun
try and wanted to take it with him.
Simon then visited a pawnbroker, se
cured the -weapon and gave It to Bert
STORY OF THE SHOOTIXG.
For the last few days Bert had been
Induced to remain at home and take
care of himself. He planned a trip to
Cleveland, Ohio, and was to have started
this morning with his wife. Trunks were
packed and all was in readiness for the
journey. The ex-Senator, however, went
downtown on Friday night to bid his
friends good-by and returned home short
ly before midnight. When he entered the
house he told his wife of two suspicious
characters who were evidently waiting
for him on California street and he con
tinued to. talk about them during tha
night. Hi* pain was very great and be
slept but little. Shortly after 7 o'clock
ha told his wife that he thought he heard
a noise in the kitchen and arose to in
vestigate. The pistol shot followed and
Mrs. Bert, after extinguishing the blaz
ing garment, dua to tha close contact of
tha pistol, half-dragged, half-carried the
wounded man back to bed.
Dr. Manning and Dr. Ballard war* sum
moned and at first believed the injury to
ba a slight one. The bullet was of U2
caliber and it did not seem that tha ball
had- penetrated deeply. When the probe
was inserted, however, it was discovered
that the lead had passed entirely through
the left lung and it was necessary to ex
tract the bullet from the back.
Should no serious complication follow
Bert may recover, but thera is danger
both of blood poisoning and pneumonia.
Last night the patient wasjesting easily.
THREE LEGISLATIVE TERMS.
Eugene Bert has been prominently con
nected with baseball 'from its early days
in this city and has done much in making

ACTOR FOLK
AT ALCAZAR
IN TEMPEST
Admirers of Mary Young and
Elizabeth Woodson Clash
and Stage Favorites Meet
With Unusual Keception
UNEEHEAESED SCENE
IS HELD AT THEATER
Ingenue's Cold Recognition
Turned Into a Triumph by
Kindly Act of Her Sister
Artists of the Company
There was a "tempest in a teapot"
at the AlcSzar. Theater yesterday af
ternoon when a clash between the ad
mirers of Mary Young, wife of John
Craig, the leading man, on the one
hand,, and Elizabeth "Woodson; the in
genue of the stock company, on the
other, caused nothing less than a tumult
in the crowded house. : When the smoke
of battle cleared away, the admirers of
Miss Wodson had .won a distinct vic
tory. Professional jealousy is said to
have been the cause .of the trouble.
Three weeks ago, Fred Belasco, man
ager of the Alcazar, decided to put on
Bret Harte's "Tennessee's Pardner" and
cast Miss Woodson for the .leading
role. Mary Young thought. the she was
entitled to the part and remonstrated
with Belasco.
The outcome :of the interview was
that Mary Young left in tears and Fred
Belasco had in his pocket a dainty note
conveying the resignation of Miss
Young from the company. , As a con
sequence of Miss Young's resignation,
her husband, John Craig, also decided
to hie himself to pastures new.
BIUSAKS A RULE.
One week ago Miss Young took- her
farewell of the Alcazar audiences. Her
many friends showered her with flow
ers and, to the surprise of the stage
manager, when an insistent call was
made for Miss Lawrence, the leading
lady of the company, Mary Young
slfpped before the curtain and made
a speech to the audience. Now speeches
to an audience must have the consent
of the management and a violation of
this rule means dismissal. But Miss
Young was ending her engagement* and
no penalty could be exacted. ".
Yesterday afternoon Miss Woodson.
John Craig. Lillian Lawrence and
Harry Hilliard made their final mati
nee appearance at the Alcazar, as they
are air leaving for the East. â¢ having
concluded their contracts.
Craig's wife, Mary Young, was very
much in evidence at the matinee. She
sat in a stage box-, and held an im
promptu reception, . much to the sur
prise of the management and the won
derment of the audience., v, When flow
ers galore were showered .on Craig,

A beautiful assortment has become^badly, broken, leaving about 75 miscellaneous silk suits. The styles
are, right and the making is splendid, but there' isn't enough to warrant thftm staying in "regular stock." We
haven't all sizes' in every style, but we have every size froni 32 to 44 in some style. The cut above shows a
hasty sketch of a few of them. The prices below give little idea of their beauty.^ You must come in and
see them. We know of no previous" off er. of a similar nature ever made to equal this in San Francisco. They
have been grouped into two Jots and should sell very rapidly. S"*"C*

FLOWERS FOR SUSS. WOODSON.
At the close of the' third act of the
play, an usher rushed down the aisle
with an enormous floral piece made,.of
American Beauty roses. Lillian Law
rence and Miss Woodson were on the
stage at the end of the act. }-.-:>'
Miss Lawrence received the flowers
amidst applause and raising her hand,
besought silence. Turning to Miss
Woodson," who . was on ; the verge ,of
tears. Miss . Lawrence . said :
"On behalf of the ladies of the com
pany," I desire to present ,- you ,with
these flowers and to teiryou how.much
we love you and how deeply we all re
gret ; you i are . leaving i the Alcazar."
And then ' pandemonium broke loose.
The friends of Miss Woodson made the
roof "ring with ' their applause. Time
and time again Miss Woodson was
called before. the curtain but the popu
lar-Ingenue of r the Alcazar was : too
deeply affected to return her thanks,
beyond bowing and smiling between
heri tears. > ,'.'.'

and the endTof the play saw a tumult
of plaudits given to Miss Lawrence,

we have still in stock some of the most desirable lines of can-

WHITES TO ME. MOODY
Attorney General Is Asjced
"to: Take Personal Charge
of the Cotton Leak Case
-OYSTER : BAY, July 13.â President
â¢Roosevelt has " determined that the
scandal growing out o< the cotton ra
port leaH^Jn the Department of AgfH
cultn^e. shall be probed to the. bottom.
He holds that the man or men respons
ible for the leaks, are in greater degree
culpable than they would have been
had they stolen money outright from
the Government. He proposes that As
sociate Statistician Holmes, against
whom serious allegations are made,
shall be punished, if it shall be found
possible ; to* secure his arrest and con
viction under present laws.
/â¢The. President has followed the work
of the investigation conducted by Sec
retary "^Vilaoh with keen Interest. ThÂ«
general results have been" presented â¢to
him,, together with "such recoinme.nda
ti'ons as Secretary had to malt*.
The "President took prompt and de
cisive action. He referred the matter
to' the Department o| Justice, with la
structipns that it should be given Im
mediate and* careful attention. In ac
cordance with that order Solicitor Ge,nr
eral Hoyt is now making a thoroujb
inquiry Into tho case. To relnf orcf his
forniat crrder President Roosevelt wrotÂ«
the following pointed letter to Attorney
General Moody:
"Mt Dear M r. Moody: I moat earn
estly hope that every effort vr 111 bÂ«
made to bria? Holmes to Justice, la

far greater aconndrel than U he had
atolen money from the Government* an
be ased the Government to deceive out
siders and to. make money for himself
and for others. Sincerely yours* .
ROOSEVELT."
In response to the President's lettÂ«r
Attorney General Moody replied:
"Dear Mr. President: I have received
your letter of July 12 and note with
what anxiety you express, the wish that
Holmes, the offending- official In the
cotton case, be brought to justice. If
possible. I have kept, through corre
spondence with the Solicitor General, in
close touch with this Investigation. 2 It
shall receive my most earnest personal
consideration. I will not now express
an opinion, a3 I think It better to await

EARTHQUAKE
JARS MAINE
Shocks Are Felt All Over
State and Sleeping Citizens
Are Endely Awakened
NO DAMAGffi EEPOETED
In Portland Shaking Which
Lasts Ten Seconds Is Ac
companied by ' Loud Noise
PORTLAXD, Me., July IS.-â An earth
quake shock, affecting a largo portion of
Maine, occurred at 5:10 a. m. to-day and
was noticeable for about ten seconds. It
was said to have been more severe than
the shocks of March 21, 1904. which oc
curred about 1 a. m. To-day's trembling
awoke many people from sleep. It was
reported from Bangor to KJttery and
from above Farmington to the coast at
Rockland and seemed most severe in Cen
tral Maine, esj>ecially at Augusta and
Waterx-llle. Early reports of the quak
ing: were received from Klttery, Tork,
Blddleford, Portland, Brunswick, Lewis
ton. Augusta, Waterrtlle, Rumford Falls,
Farmington, Skowhegao, Rockland, Bel
fast and Bangor, and Manchester and
Concord ln New Hampshire. Night oper
ators of the New England Telegraph ana
Telephone Company at Milltockett, east
of Bangor, did not notice any disturbance.
Two shocks were felt at BrunswicK,
Thomaston and some other places, the
second being severer than the first. In
the vicinity of Portland a rumbling noise
accompanied the shock, being heard per
ceptibly by Captain Gilbert M. Dlnsmore
of the Portland Observatory, who became
familiar with earthquakes while living
ln Morocco. The State Prison at Thom
aston waa shaken, but no damage was
done there or in any section of the State.
Reports indicate that the shock was
not felt west of New Hampshire.
CONCORD, N. H.. July 15.â An earth
quake was distinctly felt In this city at
5:10 this morning. Reports from tne city
of Manchester and other points ln that
district indicate that a distinct shock
passed over the southern part of the
State.
PIANOS AT WHOLESALE,
Have You Room for a Piano ?
If So, You Will Earn Money
by Buying One Now.
"We are looking for room for pianos.
We expected to be back ln our old re
tail quarters, where the great Monad
nock building is now being erected, in
time for the Fall trade. Unlooked-for
delays in construction make that im
possible. Hundreds of the finest pianos
ordered for the fall trade are now com
ing to us. Our wholesale warerooms
are overstocked â and still they come In
carload lots. We must get room for
them. We don't mind losing our profit
on them, but we don't want to lose in
terest on the investment and pay the
cost of storage until spring besides. We
are, therefore, selling at our temporary
wholesale Warerooms, at 514 Market
street, the finest makes of pianos in the
world at wholesale prices.
Beautiful Kimballs. Hazeltons, Schu
mans, Lesters, Deckers. Crowns â ar
tists' pianos, everyo ne of them â will be
sold at prices never before associated
with such standard names and high
quality.
The wonderful autogrand and auto
piano, the climax of piano manufacture,
on which every one can play the finest
musical compositions without practice,
will now be sold at prices which other
dealers are asking for ordinary up
rights.
To quote you prices would jeopardize
the standing and reputation of our pi
anos here and throughout the land.
Suffice it to say that any and all pianos
go at wholesale cost now. We deliver
pianos everywhere subject to examina
tion and trial.
If this is not the opportunity you
have been waiting for you will wait in
vain. If you will need an instrument at
any time within the next two years you
will be earning money by buying It
now. \u25a0

wholesale warerooms.

Militiamen Rescue Negro Po

Bent on Hanging Him
SHOOTS A YOUNGGIKL

let Hits Julia McHugh
CHICAGO. July 15.â Members of the
Eighth Regiment, Illinois National Guard,
rescued a colored policeman 1 from a
crowd that was threatening a' lynching
last night in Thirty-seventh street, near
the Rock Island tracks. The policeman
was Frederick Locke, who was appointed
recently for strike duty., In trying to
escape from a mob he opened nre with
his revolver, shooting Julia McHugh, 18
years of age.
A crowd of several hundred persons
surrounded the man, bent on killing him,
but the Eighth R^glment'Soldlers came to
his assistance.
About twenty *of the negro militiamen
were on their way to the Eighth Regi
ment Armory, preparatory to leaving for
their annual encampment at Springfield.
They heard the shots that Locke had
fired at his pursuers and rushed in the
direction whence the sound came. The
militiamen were in full uniform and
armed with rifles.
Under the Rock Island tracko in Thirty
seventh street the policeman was stand
ing off- a mob of men and women* by
flourishing his revolver. There were cries
of "lynch him!" and he feared for his
life. He first fired two shots at his pur
suers, and one of the bullets struck the
McHugh girl, who was standing at the
curb, 100 feet away. Two more shots were
fired by Locke, 'one of the bullets pass
ing through a man's hat. Finally some
of the more desperate men rushed in on
Locke from all sides and disarmed him.
He was knocked down and trampled upon
and it was at this point that the militia
men appeared with their rifles.
Locke was taken to the hospital, where
his Injuries were dressed and later he
was locked up.
The girl's injury is not serious. The
1 trouble was due to an attempt by Locke
to disperse a crowd that* was Jeering a
non-union teamster. > .
DEAN AVEIGHT POINTS
OUT A COLLEGE EVIL
Protests Against the Segre
gation of Eich Students
at Yale.
NEW HAVEN. Conn., July 15.â Dean
Wright of the Yale academic depart
ment in a report to President Hadley says
that one of the worst evils in Yale is the
segregation of rich students in expensive
dormitories. He said:..,-. A ..:.-,.
1 "Perhaps "the-moet~- serious .evil con
nected with this segregation of the well
to-do students Is that it is bringing to
gether, especially in the sophomore year,
those who aim to form the society seta,
whose chief purpose in college is popular
ity "and social recognition and to whom,
for this reason, the claims of scholarship
become secondary.
"So many of the men who have been
members of the -junior, and senior socie
ties have roomed in these sections that
there is more or less prevalent feeling
that to room there helps one's chances
! for social advancement, and this is un
doubtedly true.
\u25a0\u25a0 "It the social honors of college are to
; have any value, all men should have an
equal chance to gain them. The Yale
spirit of fairness is offended when honors
are bestowed upon an inferior man who,
because of wealth or superior location or
the Influence of friends, , has had an un-"
fair advantage over his fellows." -T*

Applies to Gendarme Monsieur MulcaMy
for Arrest of les Demoiselles.
Monsieur Rodolphe D'Armsby was
humming the Marseillaise as he walked
alcng the Rue de McAllister on' the; way
to the Chutes. It was the glorious
Fourteenth and Rodolphe was as full of
patriotism as a waterfront bootleg is of
fcarn.
4 A bas la Bastille," muttered Rodophe
as he neared his destination.
"Forever down with the Bastile."
echoed Miss Jessie Edwards, who wa*
standing at a corner of 'the boulevard.
"That's what I say," chimed in Miss
Annie Andrews, her sidekicker. "Down
with everything."
"Bonjour, mesdemoiselles," said Ro
dolphe, removing his hat politely. "Vive
!a belle France."
"Sure, kido," cried both the ladies.
\u25a0"Hurray for everything."
"Pardon." said Rodolphe. "Will the
mesaemoiselles accompany me to a cafe
to drink the health of le glorious Four
teenth?"
"You're on, kldo." acquiesced both
ladies. "We'll drink to anything." ; '\u25a0:â¢? -;''.
They drank to the Fall of the Bastille,
they Crank to the Revolution, they drank
to Napoleon, they ' drank to la belle
France, they drank to gay Paree, they
drank to the tricolor and they went the
line .of _the French Hall of Fame from
V'oltarre to Dumas. - - . "*
"Mon Dieu." declared Rodolphe. ' "It
is glorious."
At about 2 ' a. m. the trio set out for
the Chutes, arm in arm. "Amour sacre
de la patrie," chanted Monsieur Ro
dolphe.
"Good-by Dolly Gray," warbled Miss
Edwards.
"Dad gave his life for his country."
chanted Miss Andrews.
All three were laboring under- the de
lusion that they were singing the Mar
seillaiEe. 4
When they arrived at the Chutes en
trance Monsieur Rodolphe removed his
hat and said, "Entrez. mesdemoiselles. if
you please."
"Tralaloo kid," said Miss Edwards, and
glided through the portals.
"Over the river, kidlets." said Mlsa An-

\u25a0 But when the ladies appeared in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday, Monsieur Ro

"S'il vous plait, monsieur," he said. "It
was the glorious fall of la 'Bastille.

Judge Conlan dismissed the case. '
Borakey Royinskey was driving a
horse that had gout in one leg, rheuma
tism in the other three, an acute attack
of mumps and symptoms, of cholera
morbus. When Policeman Hooper of the
Prevention of Cruelty to; Animals So
ciety led the animal 'Â«ut' of the shafts
of the wagon the afflicted equine fell
down and Royinskey confessed' that he
had been afraid to unhitch the steed
for several ' months, knowing â¢ that he
would be unable to ; stand without
props.
"Why do you drive a horse Ilka that?"
demanded Judge Conlan.
"I've got to or pull the wagon my
self," replied Royinskey.
"Can't you manage some other way?"
asked the Judge.
'"Not now," replied Royinskey. "My
wife is sick and I have nobody but the
horse."
Royinskey was found guilty of
cruelty to animals and will be sen
tenced to-morrow. -
For the fourth time Morris Hlrsch, a
junkman, appeared before Judge Con
lan for peddling without a license.
There was an affable grin on Hlrsch's
face and he produced a document . on
which the ink j was scarcely dry.
Judge Con lan looked over the docu
ment "Yes, you got It â¢' about ' half ani
hour ago, didn't you?",. v , \u25a0.*'\u25a0
"So hellup, me, Shudge," declared
Morris, "I had It all the time, but ] I

"Twenty dollars," decided Judgre Con
lan. "Got any, excuses to offer?"
"I got . a . headache. , that's , all." . said
Morris mournfully. .'Such a buslnesa."

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
PACE IS GIVEN
FINAL DECREE
:Aged San Leandro Resident
and Young Wife Are Di
vorced by Judge Waste
OLD MAN MADE HAPPY
Fear That Woman Who Sued
for Her Liberty Would In
herit From Him Allayed
OAKLAXD, July 16.â Aged and infirm,
Rufus B. Pace of San Leandro was final
ly divorced to-day from Jennie Page,
Judge William H. Waste signing the de
cree, which was granted in favor of the
absent wife, though on motion of the
husband's attorney.
Mr. Page, who is now upward of TO
years old, married a woman of 20 a few
years ago. He bad long served the
Spring Valley Water Company as a col
lector of rates, and had accumulated a
considerable fortune. More than one year
ago his young wife sued for a divorce
on the grounds of extreme cruelty and
failure to provide. She alleged that her
aged husband refused to provide her with
proper food, was harsh in his treatment
of her, and neglected to take a bath for
a year. She also asked a share of his
fortune. / -".',,â¢
The couple's property interests were
Eettlcd by compromise outside of court,
Mrs. Page being paid a lump sum of
- money, and Ehe was also granted an
interlocutory decree of divorce. Then
she hied herself away to Alaska.
Two months ago Mr. Page went to a
"hospital to fndergo a delicate surgical
operation. His condition was considered
critical. He hated to die before a final i
decree of divorce was "granted, as his
wife would thereby become heir to one
half of his estate. Her attorney refused
to ask for a final decree. Two days ago
; Page's attorney asked Judge F. B. Ogden
to sign the decree, Judge Melvin, who
tried the case, being absent on a vaca-
tlon. Judge Ogden stated that on gen
eral principles he would not grant a
final decree to the losing party in a di
vorce suit.
Attorney Dudley Kinsell, in behalf of
Page, to-day had better success with
Judge Waste, who has Just returned from
a vacation and is sitting in place of
Judge Ogden. Judge Waste held that
under the statute, either party to an
action for divorce is entitled to a final
decree- one year from the entering of
an interlocutory decree, or that the
court of its own motion may grant such
linal decree.
Now Mr. Page, free of matrimonial en
tanglement, has left the hospital and
has gone to his San Leandro home quite
cheerful.
BOARD OE TEADE TO
BUY BUILDING SITE
Several Pieces of Property
Offered in Center of
Oakland.
OAICLAXD, July 15.â The Oakland
Board of Trade is now ready to take
final steps to purchase land near the
center of the city on which to build a
suitable structure for its new home.
Chairman Hugh Hogan announced
that several suitable sites have been
offered at reasonable prices and that
the special committee in charge will
make a report to the directors prob
ably at the next meeting, recommend
ing immediate action on some one of
the options that have been secured.
The Board of Trade is taking up the
complaint that many Oakland people
buy their postage stamps at the ferry
depot in San Francisco. As the num
ber of mall carriers allowed this city
is in proportion to the revenue of the
postoffice the Oakland serivce suffers
from this diversion of business to San
Francisco. By means of pamphlets and
notices through the press the board
â¢will try to induce the public to patron
ize the local postofHce.

FLOUR CAUSES
MANY DEATHS
Special Dispatch to TO* Call.
CALX. . BUREAU, . EOST BUTLDING.
WASHINGTON, July 15.-George E. An
derson. United States Consul General at,
Amoy, China, reports to the Department,
of Commerce ; and " Labor that between t
thirty and forty persons in and near
Amoy have been poisoned from eating the
products of flour sent in a shipment from
Hongkong. As nearly all flour shipped
to " this part of China is from the '. United
States, the consequent loss of trade wilt
fall -> heavily upon American * millers,
though. no fault of theirs.
â The * first \u25a0 victim was the - patron *of - a
Chinese restaurant who ate a native dish
prepared by ' the proprietor and soon be
came ill and died. His relatives asserted
that the man had been poisoned and evi
dence of .morphine poisoning was ' found.
The proprietor der*<sd that . any thing was
the 1 matter " with the food ' he, served, and
to prove it he and his family. ate some of
it.'. Within an . hour all of- them were
dead. ; Meanwhile other cases-- began
be reported in different parts j of. the city
and there were twenty-flve";r deaths .in
Amoy alone.;. A quantify of 'the flour was
shipped;. into the -ceuntry v . 4 and }" several
cases Â« of : poisoning : were -^reported 'from
these places.'. " ' '
Matters have been made a â¢ great deal
worse by the " spreading of exaggerated
reports of the conditions by anti-foreign
agitators. In Changchau.- a city of nearly
a -million inhabitants, hundreds of deaths
have been reported from the use of this
flour and many, foreigners are said to be
among the victims.
Slnces. the â¢ publication of , these reports
the * demand for foreign flour has practi
cally disappeared and hundreds of small
bakers and; dealers have large quantities
of flour on â¢ hand which they . cannot dis
pose of . and many of \u25a0 them have been
compelled to go . out of â¢ business, as the
people \u25a0 will â¢ not buy \u25a0. the - products made
from the foreign flour.
There has been no satisfactory expla
nation of the trouble, , as the poisoned
flour \u25a0 not only disappeared ' Immediately r
after the trouble commenced, but every- >
thing possible has been done to cover up*
tlTe ; matter. It is thought that the mer-"^
chants concerned made an effort to
smuggle morphine into China in packages
which were. placed in the sacks of flour,
and it. is; supposed some of these pack
ages broke and . < the , morphine - became
mixed .with the flour.
Anderson has requested the Chinese au
thorities ' to . take : prompt action .. in the
matter and try Ito punish 'the guilty per
sons. He has also asked that they Issue
proclamations \ which ~ will / prevent " preju
dice against American flour, although iÂ£
Is not absolutely 1 certain' that the flour In
question was from' America. Anderson
would like to impress upon .American
manufacturers the necessity of putting
flour in sealed packages.

During an illness with which I have Buf-

nearly eight years I have treated with
prominent physicians in Los Angeks, San

low state, scarcely able to stand, when I
decided as a last resort to try' Chinese

Him cf 607 Geary street. He diagnoses
icy case by the simple fcelins Of the

WILLi SPEAK AT'ALHAMBRA.
To-nl?ht Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gil
man, original thinker, author and lec
turer, will address San Franciscans: at
the Alharnbrar^-and that she will say
things is a foregone " cbncluslpn." She
always does; and through her vigorous,
attacks on the wrongs qt- children,
:updn the unequal allotment of political
privileges, andupon some'of the un
reasoning follies of society, she has
drawn the fire of precedent-worshipers.
And that's why her leciure to-night
will be good fun, and. why the think
ing part of the population â rsuch of it
as'caii squeeze Into . the. Alhambraâr
will" bear her.
The lecture is under the direction of
the William Morris Club; and is en
tilled "America's' Place TQrd'ay." To'
be sure, the suffrage question will be
dealt with In. all. of its ramlflcationa. .
- Mrs. Gilman has achieved some dis-.
tinction in the world of letterg, setting
up a splendid defense for the rights of
litle ones, in "Concerning Children." A*
bpok of poems published later.- reveal^
in her a dreamy quality of mind, hardly,
to be looked for In one whose work Is!
so terribly practica^for. the passing 1
years have brought .her into thÂ« thick
of "the fray, whereverl principle .and*
precedent were pitted against each
other. And it"- may be said in passing^
that Mrs. Gilman usually, puts up : a
pretty good fight, and- is forcing s her
issues into the "hostile country,, step by'
step-^-a slow-prodess, to. be sure,' but

SCHOONER MAID OF ORLEANS
MAY SOON BE FLOATED.
"Woll - Kno^n Coaster Is
Ashore, but Rests Easily
On Soft Bottom.
Disabled and Leaking the
Little Steamer Celia Is
Here for Repairs:
The schooner Maid of Orleans, which Is
reported ashore nine miles below West
port, is one of the beat known fore-and
afters. on the coast, although for more
than a year prior to June 1 she was laid
up on Puget Sound. She left Puget
Sound June 1 and arrived here June 19.
She sailed June 26 for Eureka, but In
stead of making the Humboldt port was
driven Into the shoal water where on
Friday fhe grounded.
Captain Maloney was unable to get
assistance, but was in hopes of getting
his vessel afloat at high water. Accord
ing to the latest reports the Maid was
not seriously injured. Strong head winds
end heavy gales conspired to drive the
schooner out of her course.
The Maid of Orleans In the early part
of her career was a money maker out
of all proportion to her size. Steam
competition and low freights have re
duced her earning capacity, but she was
ctill a very useful vessel when she left
here. She was built in this city in ISS2
and is of ISO tons register.
To Urius Daek Xew Sehooaer.
The tug Sea Rover left here yester

1 Old People have more of the pains,
eches and discomforts of life than do the
young, i This is perfectly natural, : be-
canse their blood is not so vigorous, nor
their powers, of . resistance so great, and"
troubles that a younger, healthy constitu-
tion could resist often afflict them.
" Durin* the civil war I contracted Ca-
tarrh and suffered with its effects for'
Â«aany years. I tried various remedies
and doctors, but with no result.
vnÂ« day I found one of your pamphlets
and read it carefully. ..decided S. lÂ». S.
was the medicine I was In need of and I
beÂ»an its use at once; My health was
dreadful, and as I was petting: along in
years, I had most of the pains and all.
ments incident to that time of li/e; but
after taking- this preat remedy for awhile
I beg-an to Improve and soon found my.
self a strong, -well man. 1 1 am now more
than 75 years of age, but my health is
eood, because I take an occasional bottle
ofS. S. S. Nothing- equals it as a tonlo
and blood purifier, and I recommend it
to those needing- such a medicine.

Rheumatic pains, sleepless nights,
fickle appetites, etc., are not imaginary !
with ola people, as is sometimes thought. .
They need a medicine that will supply
their blood with its lost vigor and build
upland strengthen their constitutions.
S. S. S. is the ideal remedy for Old Peo-
ple. It is made entirely from roots,
herbs and barks, and does'not injure the
system in the least as do those medicines
containing mineral ingredients. S. S. S.
is gentle in its action, purifying the blood
of all. poisons

is the greatest
of all tonics for increasing the appetite,
toning up the stomach, promoting the di-

J Completed Without Single
Accident or 'Breakdown
The automobile record from "Los An
geles to ; this '. city 1 went glimmering; for
the I second time within a'v month .yes
terday when L. ]_ \u25a0 Whitman'- and' R. C.
Hamlin arrived here at J 9:30 o'clock,
covering: the entire distance in twenty
nine hours | and thirty 'minutes. . #and
clipping: two | hours v and^ four \u25a0' minutes
ort the record they made Just a month
ago. . ' \u25a0. . \u0084.'-; \u25a0 'â¢ v', _. ./--;
The run was made in a little slxteen
horse power runabout, the " identical
machine in which Whitman and Ham
ltn lowered the marki a\ month, -agro.
They made their second trip without
meeting with, a single mishap and alt
hough the roads were not as good as
they might have been, the motorists
managed to tear along in record ttime
all the way. -
Whitman and Hamlin might "have
made the trip in much faster time. had
they chosen* They arrived' in j Salinas
yesterday morning at' S o'clock and any^
ordinary chauffeur" can make the >un
from â¢ that place to ' this 1 city in four,
hours. But Whitman and. Hamlin" did
not want . to ; take any chances in | the
home stretch. They knew they had al
ready lowered the mark and" were con
tent to travel the last few miles by
easy stages. , _-' s: . _- ;' â¢ .
The daring motorists reported at tim
ing stations; all along \u25a0 the line and in
this way proved they were making a
legitimate run. They stopped at all
the towns en route to take on gasoline
and provisions; Neither ; man had ; a
wink of sleep during the, trip and con
sequently when they- arrived here'yes
terday morning they were ; worn out
from the strain and \u25a0 loss : of rest. \u0084
Whitman and Hamlin made the trip
entirely without incident. They ' start
ed from the southern city. Friday morn
ing at 4. o'clock. Although the hour
was early,-a large-crowd ,of 'auto 1 ; en
thusiasts were on hand togive the pair
a fitting send-off. The heat .was ter
rific during part of the trip," but this
did not bother, the record , breakers,
who plugged along as fast as; the ma-"
chine â¢ could carry them all: the time." : "'.,
â¢ Hamlin said if the roads .were In
better shape the trip could easily have
been made in .two hours' less time. -The
dust was thick all along the highways
from the south and -this to
some extent with the speed of the lit
tle machine. Whitman and Hamlin left
for Los Angeles on the Owl. train last
night, well satisfied with their great
run. .. .) : - .... .. - : . ; . ; ; _ . -

HERFORD MAKES
PLEA FOR TIME
Baltimore Man Says He Will
Be Ready to Name the Eef
eree by Monday Evening
WELCH OR.GRANEY SUITS
Britt Promises to Be a Top-
Heavy Favorite Over the
Fighter From Washington
"When Willie Britt. representing his
brother " James, and A. Herford, appear
ing for Kid Sullivan, came together last
night, they were 6till at outs regarding
a referee for the flght which takes place
at Woodward's Pavilion on Friday night.
Both managers admitted that they liked
â¢Coth Welch and Graney, but still they
could not make up their minds as to
who it ehould be. They adjourned after
a long session, to meet again on Monday
night, when the referee will surely be
named.
Morris Levy, manager of the Hayes
Valley Club, was anxious that the third
man in the ring be chosen then and there
and felt very much put out because an
agreement had not been reached. He said
that so long as both Welch and Graney
looked good to the managers, they cer
tainly should come to an" understanding,
but it was all in vain.
Herford pleaded for more time. He
said he was a stranger in a strange land
and wanted to look around a bit more be
fore he made up his mind. When Britt
and Levy tried to urge the Baltimore
man to come to terms he refused and
asked as a personal favor that they give
him. till Monday night, when he promises
to have his mind fully made up. f
Eddie Graney did not report to the man
agers regarding his stand in the matter,
but** from what he eaid on Friday night,
it is almost a certainty he will , get into .
the going again. Welch has not been
Questioned yet, but there is no reason to
believe that he will turn down the offer
if it is made to him. â¢ .
The tangle is a peculiar one In every
tense of the word. Both men , seem satis
lied with' .either \Welch or Gfariey, but
still they do not care- to v hold out for
cither man in particular. No other names
have been proposed bo far, save that : of
Jeffries, and it does not seem likely that
the club will go to the expense of bring
ing the former champion up from Los
Angeles and, besides, he has not yet been
communicated with and may refuse Vthe
offer without hesitation.- -- - - â
The tight should be an easy one to
referee as both Britt and Sullivan are
clean fighters and it is more than -likely
the end will come with a knockout. If
the bout goes the .whole route, it looks
as though Britt would- win by many
lengths, as he is surely a better boxer
than Sullivan and capable of forcing the
fighting all the way.
Herford still clings to the opinion that
the Washington lad will lower the. plum
ber boy's colors. None of the San Fran
cisco sports have ever seen Sullivan in
action, and therefore they are not in r a
position to say. Britt will be a top-heavy
favorite aa Sullivan r- has no admirers
RYAN AND PETERSON READY.
Lively- Battle Promised WleÂ« the Wel-
ters Sieet on Wednesday Night.
- Buddy Ryan | and George." Peterson
are about ready to get at each other.
The rival welter-weights have been
Working In good form for the last two
weeks and both . axe practically at
weight. Ryan Is doingthis training at
the beach, while Peterson's camp is lo
cated at Cr'oll's Gardens, Alameda.
\u2666 The fight . will . take . place at Colma
next Wednesday, night and should prove
one of the best fistic -attractions of the
year. Ryan has proved .himself to" be
the~ best welter-weight in j the. Business,
while Peterson "-showed his class last
month â¢by making' a 'monkey \u25a0 out of
Jack Clancy, holder of the _ English
title. ffi*BraBÂ§ajPj3i
As both men like to wade In and
fight, punch for punch, it is very likely
that the bout will never reach*- the
twenty-fifth round. Ryan relies on his
great haymaker, which has won \ for
him so many battles. - Peterson Â« has
jnany inches the advantage in reach,
but lacks the experience and ring^ gen-,
eralsblp of the champion.
Gus Ruhlln and ; his manager, Billy
Madden, will arrive from the, East to
night. Ruhlin Is carded to go against
big Jim McCormick at Colma. in-' the
early oart of next month. ;, Ruhlin will
ro Into training right away in order to
be in form for the- meeting.

TACOMA. July 15.â Unable to get
more than one hit an Inning, tho Tigers
had no chance to score with Teddy Cor
bett" pltching.'as steadily 'as "a clock.
Only two other pitchers have shut out
the home team on their own grounds
this year, Whalen and Garvin. One
Tiger reached third and two saw sec
ond base. , but the batters could not get
; the hits to bring them in. Threatening
weather* cut down the attendance and
[ the field was sloppy. In the last three
i innings ; ft rained. Both teams go to
Portland to-night .to play a series of
: eight games. .
*"; Tacoma might have scored had Atz
not performed in great form, cutting
oft several drives. that only 'fast work
prevented going safe. He also started
! a double play that put the Tigers to
the bad. In the eighth Xordyke hit for
; two bases, but the next; three were
i easy . outs.t9HSPHju ""
McLean hit safely in the second, Cor
bett drewa pass and Jones forced the
latter.-, Paul's two-bagger brought two
In after Jones stole second. Singles by
Atz, Van Buren and Householder gave
the .visitors their third tally. ; Score:

NEW YORK, July 15.â Walter Scott,
who owns, limitless. mountains: of gold
in the Mojave Desert, did.not retire last
night with the' curfew at -the He mid
Square Hotel, where he is lodging." He
has not retired there yet and Mrs.
Scott, who arrived in" town : at prO^a. m.
to-day with- a small' hand- \u25a0-\u25a0'bag,- is
anxious to find her husband.. Though
she has not said it, there. is every in
dication that Mrs. Scott . ; is '; "broka"
When "Scotty" bade her, farewell in
Chicago on Wednesday, he had: his yel
low backs somewhere in his: Jeans: -
When Mrs. Scott arrived at the hotel
she I went to her husband's ; room. She
expected to find the- miner, but was
disappointed.- Neither could she .find
the "yaller" dog.
There, was : a crowd : waiting for
Scotty" in the lobby, and bar-room "of
the hotel. It waa a mixed * and' hungry,
looking ~ assemblage. According to
authentic accounts, . "Scotty": \u25a0; was
draining pints of wine in theHaymar
ket with a. wine agent'as his_ sole com
panion. When the notorious" resort
closed, it did; not Indorse "Scotty". as
a spender.' . â¢*".. -
When Mrs. Scott was seen she did
not appear very much worried over her
husband's absence. She '< is a little
woman, with light hair. and. a.v faded
complexion. She dresses . entirely, jin
black and wears no other Jewelry than
a plain gold wedding ring. ; When ad
vised that her- husband hadvisited.the
Haymarket last night, she said' rather
sadly: ..:. \u25a0\u25a0; â¢â¢
; "Well, I hope he , is having a good
time. I think that he" might come and
lookme up. I made a mistake in get
ting to New York. " Walter, wrote : me
to . come on thd Pennsylvania Limited."
Somehow I got on the Lake Shore Ac
commodation and was unable,, to*, get "a
berth. Consequently I had to sit up
two nights and any now very, tired.".

Dried Fruit la ?few York.
Late tnall advices from New York say:
"The period of unprecedented hot weathei
In California last week is reported to have
worked great damage to the ripening -. fruit
crops. According to telegraphic advices re
ceived here on Saturday apricots and prunes
have suffered the greatest amount of injury.
One report sent to a prominent commission
house with wide connections on the coast and
elsewhere â¢Â» as to the effect that fully 25 per
cent of the apricot crop in the Santa, Clara
Valley has beea destroyed. The market, how
ever, doee not yet eeetn to have felt the 'In
fluence which ruch conditions might naturally
be expected to have txpon prices, las offerings
continue to be made from some quarters on
the basis of 6%c f. o. b. coast. for choice
Royals, for last half of July shipment.
Prunes were advanced' by some sellers on the
coest. aocordisg to telegrams vest -here on
Saturday, to a -%c 1. 0. b. four-size bag
ttz'.t. for 40s. 60s and 60s, 3c basis for 60s
to 90s Inclusive and 3%@4c basis, for 30s,
the reason assigned being that the great heat
wac shriveling the fruit, reducing the pro
portion of large eizes, and was also causing
a considerable drop from the trees in many
orchards. On -account of the short day the
news Cld not receive wide circulation here
on Saturday asd its Influence upon the mar
ket could not therefore be gauged. Peaches
remained very flrm but no Information was
received to Indicate that thU crop waa af
fected to the same extent as apricots and
prcaes. The raisin situation was unchanged,
offerings being light and the tone of the mar
ket very firm.*'

: srruATioN is discussed
Â»
Speakers Say That Success
of Campaign Depends on
' Starting at Primaries
The San Francisco Republican League
of the Forty-second Assembly District
held a rousing meeting at Saratoga Hall
last, night- The representative business
men' and property holders of that section
were present In large numbers. J Dr.
Henry J. Gibbons Jr. was chairman, and
J. A. McGee acted as secretary.
The general voice of the meeting was
that reform was needed . In the political
situation here." Another factor that dom
inated the Issue put forth by the speak
ers was that, tne success of the, coming
campaign depended on getting a start at
the primaries. All voters were requested
to turn out in force and help elect dele
gates who would nominate' honest, capa
ble and efficient officers to serve the cause
of the people.
This would result In a reform In politics
which was greatly needed, -it was de
clared. â¢
Among the speakers were Fairfax
Wbeelan. Daniel A. Ryan. Thomas C.
West, R. C. Van Fleet, George W. Lewis,

FORTY-FOURTH DISTniCT.
Organization Committee Holds Meeting
and Resolve* to Work With
Enthusiasm.
Officers were elected -for the coming
political campaign at the meeting of
the organization, committee- of the
Forty-fourth Assembly District Club
last night at the headquarters of the.
Republican League, 63G Market street.
It was decided that tho organization
committee constitute itself a committee
on registration and finances, thus doing
away with the many smaller commit
tees usually appointed.
No regular meeting place has been
selected for the voters supporting the
Republican League in the Forty-fourth
District, but Jt is the purpose of the
executive committee that every man in
every precinct shall do his utmost, to
further tho progress of the organiza
tion. A resolution was adopted by
which the organizers became the ex
ecutive committee of the Republican
League, with power to select delegates
to the municipal convention.
The lollowing oiucers were elected:
Martin Brady, president; Fred Lund
quist, first vice president; George Hlll
jnan, second vice president;; ty iuiam
Blakeley, treasurer; James McXiar,
secretary. President Brady will appoint
tvrp auxiliary commltteemen from each
precinct to help in the general work
of the club.
Labor Party Fnction* Disagree.
No agreement' was reached In the con
ference between the committees from
the United Labor League and the Union
Labor County Committee which was
held last night. The United Labor
League committee insisted that no City
Hall employe should go to the next la
bor convention 'as a delegate, but that
that the delegates shall all be laboring
men working at their craft The meet
ing was not a stormy one, but each Bide
was determined that it would not give
in to the demands of the other, and they
adjourned without taking* any action.
The United Labor League will begin the
\u25a0work of organizing the party within
the next few days. The primaries take
place on August S and the convention
will be held some time in September.
