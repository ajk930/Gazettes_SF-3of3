LONDON. May 22. â The sitting of the
House of Commons to-night wa3
marked by scenes of the wildest disor
der, growing out of a motion by Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman to adjourn
the House in order that it might discuss
bis charge against Premier . Balfour of
having violated his pledge not to deal
with the subject of colonial preference
without first appealing to the country.
Alfred Lyttelton. Secretary of State
for the Colonies, was put up to reply
to the Liberal leader, but the members
of the opposition shouted down his
every attempt to speak, even after
the Premier had demanded a hearing,
for the Secretary. Finally the ' Spea
ker, after he had exhausted every effort
to quell the turbulence, put into force
for the ' first .time a new rule, empow
ering him to adjourn the House in cases
of grave disorder.
The matter came up at the afternoon
sitting, when Premier Balfour. reply
ing'to questions on .the subject, said
he did not consider himself pledged to
inaction in regard to colonial, prefer
ence, , except so far as parliamentary
action \u25a0was concerned. He reiterated
that the Government did not Intend " to
deal with the -fiscal question in the
present Parliament, j The 'matter of
colonial . preference . might, however, be
submitted to a colonial conference in
1906, even, though the country had not
previously had an opportunity of ex
pressing an opinion on the subject. The
decision of the conference, however,
would not be bindinsr either on the
mo.ther country or on the colonies
without legislative action.
â¢ CHARGE AGAINST PREMIER.
- Sir .Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the
Liberal leader, charged Balfour with
having violated the pledge he had made
In his - Edinburgh speech, and moved
the adjournment of the House to discuss
the matter. . Tn.e Liberal leader de
manded a plain answer, from Premier
Balfour, and Alfred Lyttelton, Secre
tary of State for the Colonies, arose to
reply.
The members of the opposition
drowned the efforts of the Secretary
with cries of "Balfour! Balfour!" Af
ter continuing for about ten minutes
Lyttelton sat down.
Winston Churchill, then attempted to
speak, but the Ministerialists drowned
his efforts, the Nationalists joining in
the din and shouting for the police.
After a number of members had failed
to obtain a hearing the Premier rose to a
point of order and a temporary lull fol
lowedA Balfour said he' thought it highly
improper that he should be immediately
expected to follow the leader of the op
position. He said he had never before
known the opposition to refuse to hear a
Minister, and he insisted that the House
hear Secretary Lyttelton. as otherwise
the dignity of the House could not be
maintained.
Lyt telton again mads an attempt to
speak, but the uproar was renewed. Fin
ally , the * Speaker said it was obvious
that the scene could not continue, and
he would therefore adjousa the House
under the rules empowering the Speak
er to take such action in cases of grave
disorder. r
The- Speaker had been unable to secure
even a semblance of order, after howls
and counter-howls lasting more than an
hour.
GAIXERTES JOE* IX BTCBBCB.
. The Â«' action of the . Speaker and tha
scenes 'ln the House created a tremen
dous sensation in the lobbies, which \u25a0were
crowded with members '. discussing every
phase of the evening's occurrences, which
were declared to be unprecedented. The
galleries .were filled Â« with peers and
other : distinguished persons who had
gathered in the hope of hearing.an;ln
teresting debate on the fiscal question.
They ' took J part in the â¢ cries â¢ for their
favorites, thus "adding to ;the* din. and
afterward Joined the excited crowsd In
the lobbies.
Except when Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nennan taunted him with betas the sola
cause of the disorder and Balfour flashed
an angry reply, the- Premier -was ' most
composed throughout the . sitting.
Lyttleton also showed the greatest self
possession In his difficult position. Stand-
Ing at " the treasury, table." flushed, but

There is little or no trouble along the
Canadian border since Canada has
adopted laws that largely conform to
those of the United States. The chief
difficulty is now along the Mexican line
and there immigration officials find the
greatest difficulty in the matter of ex
clusion of those who do not come with
in the law.
Officials of the Department of Com
merce and Labor Insist that the immi
gration laws are now being enforced
to the very letter. In fact, there never
vas such stringent enforcement as dur
ing the present year, and yet all rec
ords will be broken.
On this account an increase Sn the
head tax Is now regarded more serious
ly than acy other proposition yet put
forth. : YV -.;
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
"WASHINGTON, May 22. â "In my opin
ion, the Immigration problem at the
present time is the most serious that
confronts the Government and the peo
ple of this country," said Secretary Met
calf of the Department of Commerce
and Labor to-day.
"It's most perplexing feature is the
question of distribution. The Southern
States have reported to this department
that they could employ many thousands
of immigrants there. Within a few Jays
we received a letter from Louisiana stat
ing that that State alone could give em
ployment to- 100.000 men in the field; and
I know very well that more men are
needed to work the farms of the great
West. But the disposition of nearly all
incoming foreigners is to concentrate in
the great cities. It is this concentration
that makes the problem at once difficult
and necessary of immediate solution.
The present fiscal year will break all
records. It seems to me tliat it remains
for Congress to take some action."
Metcalf is not the only member of the
administration who Is becoming alarmed
a? the situation. The President'and other
members of his Cabinet have repeatedly
discussed the question and important
recommendations wlll.be made to the In
coming Corxgress. Three methods of re
striction are at present under considera
tion: . . â¢
An tncr*nÂ»e on the bead tax from S3
rai-h to S2O or $25 each.
Limitation of the number of immi
grants from each foreign country.
An educational qualification.
It is pointed out that of all these pro
posed remedies the first, an increased
head tax. is the most feasible. In order
to limit immigration from foreign coun
tries, it is said, it will be necessary to
treat all alike, a difficult solution of
the problem. A large percentage of im
migrants coming to this country to
day are from Austria-Hungary, Italy
and Russia. The educational test
would work as a limitation for only a
brief period, because it is believed by
the officials here that the steamship
companies' themselves, which are now
encouraging immigration to such an
alarming extent. would establish
schools abroad simply for the purpose
of meeting the educational require
ment. :"Â»'.'
The plans,' so far as they have gone,
call for. a building which; will incorporate
all* of -.the i most: auvanced ; ideas â¢ \n~ tene :

two Russian detachments occupied the

dispatch adds that General Martinoff's
detachment, from -Tadlu, also drove
back the Japanese advanced cavalry,

The dispatches received from the
front are meager, but there, are some
indications that General Linevitch has
taken a leaf out of Field Marshal
Oyama's book at the Shakhe River and
at Mukden and that he is about to ad
vance'himself and undertake a counter
offensive, meeting the Japanese pres
suVe against his left "by advancing his

termine whether thVmoves thus far are
more than feints.

admiral's whereabouts is volunteered,

the fact that they are not in the secret

STRIKE TO END
AT EARLY DATE
As for Powers, he has the reputation
of bring a "square" gambler. He re
cently clcpod his gambling-room in re-
Kpcrise lo the deir.and of the law and or
der clement of El Paso. He Is still in
the eal-.cn business. His trade is on the
increase by reas-jn cf the fame that has
vt h'.m for having been an honored
suest at dinner with President Roosevelt.
Friends cf Captain Garrett say thatno
"olanie should be attached to that official
fcr the dinner episode; that it was an in
formal affair and that the profession or
vocation of the men who were present
\u25a0was of little moment to President Roose-
Vf-H or anybody else at the reunion. They
say t^at Captain Garrett would' be the
last mfin m the world to knowingly per
petrate the slightest indignity upon the
President. They adintt that he may have
been guilty of an indiscretion, but they
say thyt it should be overlooked.
L!nlil the publication of this photograph
v.-rs made it was not generally known
that Powers was one of tne honored
guests ax that noted dinner in the camp
of the Kcugh Kiders. He occupied a prom
inent pia<.^ at the table, being seated di
rectly opposite the President. He was
nor :Â». Rough Ridir. and, so far as couid
be le;:i::t<2. he possessed no particular
claim to distinction to give him a seat at
ihc- table with the President of the United
Slates Texas friends of the President,
who know Powers felt aggrieved that the
chitf executive should have been im
posed upon and a quiet investigation was
eet on loot to discover who was respon
sible for Powers' presence as one of the
President's quests.
It is said that this responsibility has
been rixed uj>on Captain Patrics Garrett,
collector of the port of El Paso. Garrett
ls a mutual friend of Powers and Presi
dent Roosevelt. He Is said to have in
vited Powers to accompany him to San
Antor.io lo see the President. Captain
Garrett introduced Powers to the Presi
dent as his friend and the latter extend
td an Invitation to the two men to be
his quests at the mess dinner in the
Rough Riders' camp.
According to statements made here by
men who hr.ye Interested themselves in
the matter. President Roosevelt has been
advised that Powers was a saloonkeeper
und cx-proprietcr of ii gambling resort.
It is stated that secret service men have
been at K\ Paso for the past several days
Investigating the circumstances leading
up to the dinner incident and that upon
their rtport will depend whether Captain
Giifitt shall be called to account by the
President.
AUSTIN. Tex,, May r.â A New York
llluktratej publication" recently contained
a picture of President Roosevelt eating
didnerat the mess df the officers of the
Rough Riders' regiment at the San An
tonio reunion. One of the guests at the
table was "Tom" Powers of El Paso, pro
prietor of the Conc-y Island saloon, . and
wlio for many yfars conducted one of
the b!cgest gambling houses in , the
Southwest.
Minister Bowen appeared in Secretary
Taft's office this morning with his final
statement, which he handed to Secretary
Taft. Its most noticeable feature was a
request that an examination be made of
the canceled checks, stubs and bank
bocks of Loomis and W. H.- Bean, former
resident agent of the New York and Ber
mudez Asphalt Company in Caracas.
Bean gave Loomis the check for $10,
000. Both say It was merely in return
for Loomis' Venezuelan money, which
he desired to exchange, as. he was leav
ing Caracas. Loomis has stated that his
check book with the stubs has been lost.
The $10,000 ' check is alleged to be in the
possession of President Castro.

President Roosevelt consented to the
necessary three or four weeks' extension

of the Philippines leaves the Russians

lengthily points out that the informa

-view that Rojestvensky. Is skirting the
north of the Philippines into the Pacific.
It ls maintained that the strateigc .ob

CHICAGO. May 22. â A stampede of
shorts to-day advanced . the price tit
corn for May delivery precisely 6 cents
a bushel. .It was current gossip that
the May option Is practically "cornered"
by a few" prominent traders. A de
sire to avoid possibly greater loss than
already incurred was the ,cause of the
urgent demand .to-day from those who
were on the wrong. side of the market.
The May delivery opened at 53c. The
price quickly jumped to 59c a bushel.

A somewhat similar situation de
veloped in the wheat pit. On an active
demand from shorts the price of wheat
for. May delivery was forced up 4 cents
a bushel. Much of the gain was sub
sequently lost on profit taking. May
wheat^opened at 99c. After advancing
to SI 03 the price , dropped to $1 01 3Â£.
After the early \u25a0> bulge the market
quieted, down considerably. Under con

corn sold off to 56% c. The wheat mar
ket also lost much of its bullishness.
Final quotations on May wheat were
at $1 01, a net advance for the day of

Flvt; yecrs ago I ventured the suggestion that
the process of membrane formation is a pro
cess of coagulation. It Is, however, obvious
that the membrane formation In those experi

tion, as In this case the membrane formation
should occur while the eggs are in the acid,
and not after they are taken out. Moreover,
the fact that only certain acids act In this
way al?o excludes such an opinion. From a
closer observation of the process* of membrane
form&tion I am inclined to believe that it is
due to a process of secretion. ,\. *\u0084 the squeez

should, however, not be overlooked that the
process of membrane formation is in these ex
periments followed by th.c formation of a spin
die, and that thus far these two phenomena
have not been separated.

WHAT FACTS SHOW.
I fir.d tliat tÂ±tÂ» substances which call forth
the membrane formation in the egg may be
Sividod into two groups. The one group in
cludes hydrocarbons and certain products of
substitution, the second â¢jroup consists of o*r
tiiin acids. The two groups differ, tn that trie
membrane formation occurs while the egg is
in cor.tact with the hydrocarbons, but does not
occur xvhile it Is in contact with the acids,
but only after It Is transferred back Into nor
mal eea water.
â¢Since :hcse exper::nÂ«>nts proved the great
* itr.iflcance of ttie process of membrane for
mation, it was of interest to ascertain whtch_
sub^tunofi are fit to call forth this process. It
ii- obvious that S complete knowledge of these
fljltfaacei muFt alÂ«j include the substance
tvr.icn is responsible for the membrane forma- I
tion iiiimrdiattly after the ej>ermatozoon has
:r.te*ic<J the egg. . . \u25a0 ..
My ;r.tihcd of procedure is as follows: The
f-css arÂ«Â» first treated with one of the acids
Â« tdcfa ezzise the membrane formation. F\>r
this ;,uri<Â«e 3 c.c. of* a JC/IO solution of a
tatty acid. e.g.. acetic, propionic. butyric or
vnit-ru.nie. e:c. are added to 50 c.c. of sea
vt-nter. The eggs remain in this solution for
irem 'i to lVs minutes. When transferred
tiack 10 normal sea water they form a mem
brane which cannot b-s distinguished from â¢ a
membrane of fertiHration.
TELLS OF HIS METHODS.
One result of this latest discovery of
Dr. Loeb's is that he resigns a theory
he promulgated five years ago, when he
"ventured the suggestion" that the "pro
cess of membrane formation is a process
of coagulation." He says to-day: "From a
closer observation of the process of mem
brane formation I am Inclined to believe
that it is five to a process of secretion."
Dr. Loeb't, account of his triumph and
its significance in its relation to the long
search he has made into the mysterious
realm where the origin of life has its
source is In part as follows:
According to the method described in my
two previous not*s, the unfertilized eggÂ» of
the e;a-urchln <St*"onsylocentrotus purpuratus)
were tirst submitted lor two hours to hyper
toaic sea water (luO c.c. sea water plus -15
c.c. 2' a XaCl solution), and were then treated
with acetic or tormlc acid In order to pro
duce a membrane. Since In the process of fer
tilization by Ep:-!rcn the membrane is formed
immediately alter the spermatozoon enters. It
eeemed to me that In the case of a complete
imitation of the fertilizing effects of the sper
matozoon by chemical means, the membrane
formation should also constitute the first In the
series of events. I had, however, met with
the difficulty that when the membrane forma
tion It caused first, and the .eggs are submit
ted for two hours to the hypertonle sea. water
arterward. they will not as a' rule develop into
larvae. I have since found that this difficulty
can ~<> ovtrcorae. and that the last postulaxe
of a complete Imitation of the process of fer
tilization ty <:berrÂ»ical means can also be sat
isfiedânamely, that the order of events should
be the same in both cases. It is only necessary
to submit the eggs which already possess a
membrane for a considerably shorter period
t.ian two hours to the hypertonlc sea water â
from between 25 to 50 minutesâ according to
the t -mjxrature and differences in thÂ« eggs
of different f< males
BERKELEY, May 22.â One more impor
tant step has been taken by Professor
Jacques Leeb in his search for the causes
that produce life, the latest discovery of
the famous savant being described in a
bulletin issued to-day at the University
of California. Dr. Loeb announces that
he has finally completed an Imitation of
the fertilizing effects of spermatozoon in
sea urchins by chemical means. He has
caused the formation of a membrane
a:ound unfertilized eggs, this being the
first of the processes that follow the
entrance of natural spermazotoon when
eggs are fertilized and life is created

It Is now expected that a decision win

The impression Y>Â»* gained ground at
tha uiiiversity, however, that Tolo Coun
ty eventually will capture the 050,000
plum, and that the university farm will
be located there. It Is said that Governor
Pardea, President Wheeler and Bean Hll

the Haywards site, in Alameda. County,
but Tolo County, which is regarded by
most people as a dark horse in the com
petition, is declared no*w to have the
greatest hope of being selected as the
spot where unrreratry students "will get
practical lessons in agriculture.
A xwnniTwrrt- prof essor in the College of
Agricnltnre said to-day that. wbJlfl Hay

VALLEJO, May 22.â The kick of a
pig which he .was killing in a local
slaughter house this morning nearly
caused the death of Samuel Downs,
butcher. Just as . Downs had cut the
pig's. throat the animal began kicking
violently. One of its hoofs struck the
butcher's sharp knife and drove It into
his forearm, severing all the veins. But
for the promptness and surgical skill
of Downs' fellow workmen the butcher
would have bled to death.

With Corbett at the beach everything
is moving along nicely. He has changed
his training methods, to a great extent,
and is following a fixed programme.
Where he - formerly- took an occasional
day off and worked overtime .the follow
ing day to catch up he is now keeping
along with the procession every day, and
is doing the healthful sort of exercise he
needs. < There Is less boxing and more
real labor in the new order of things,
and the former champion Is showing the
benefit of the change. <
Hanlon and Corbett are both progress
ing in their work of conditioning for the
third and last meeting. Eddie has an
nounced that this must be a winning
battle, or be his last. He will take off
the gloves for all time if he does not
prove Corbett's master. He is going
along in his usual easy fashion, doing
all that Is asked of him and mixing a
little recreation with his daily grind. This
afternoon he will captain 4 a baseball
team" and play third base at Alameda
against a team of actors from the local
theaters. .
Whoever wins, it is certain to be a
good fight,' as both lads are the sort that
wade in and take a punch to land one.
Another preliminary of lesser importance
will be added to the show, but, like the
Peterson-Mayfield go, it must be full of
fight to suit the purposes . of Alex Greg
gains, who believes in giving satisfaction
from flagf all to finish. .
Tiring of the Inactivity In the so-called
amateur circles, George Peterson and
Frank Mayfleld have decided to take off
the cloak entirely and become sure
enough professionals. Last . nifjht they
signed articles ,with the v , San Francisco
Club for a ten-round Â«iatch at 145 pounds
as the main, preliminary to theCorbett-
Hanlon bout on the night of June 2. Pe
terson is unquestionably the best of the
local welters at the four-round distance,
with Mayfleld as his nearest competitor.
It remains to be seen whether Mayfleld
will not have the best Of it at the longer
route. -~*
Up to the time the men stepped into
the ring it looked as though they
would not meet. There was' a hjtch
over weighing in. Attell tipped the
beam at 126. but Nelson refused to get
on the scales, claiming his contract did
not call for it. Attell refused to go on
and the management decided to put on
lfld Herman of Chicago, Attell finally
consented to fight. Nelson looked to
weigh about 134 or 126 pounds. .
sÂ» . \u25a0
In tbe second and third rounds, how
evei;* whdn Nelson led he caught At
tell several times on the jaw without
doing any damage. In the latter part
of the fourth Nelson sent" Attell to the
floor, but Abe was on his feet in an in
stant. The fifth round was slightly In
faror of Nelson, as was also part of
the sixth. In the latter part of the
Eixth. however. Attell recovered him
self and was hammering Nelson with
rights and lefts when the bell sounded.
It was a good, fast bout from start
to finish. From the way Attell started
in it- looked as though Nelson would
not last the six rounds, but what the
Dane lacked in cleverness he made up
in grameness and ability to take punish
ment. All through the first four rounds
Attell jabbed Nelson in the face and
In the stomach and got away without
receiving a blow.
It tras the old Btory of the finished
boxer groing against the fighter. At
tell's cleverness proved too much for
Xclson and In the first four of the six
rounds of the fight the California^
jabbed the other man at wilL In the
fifth round Audi's strength began to
wane, but he was able to hold Kelson
easily.

town daily except Sundays, holidays,
vacations and the days he does not feel
like coming down to the office. . On
the" first day of each month he. ls ex
pected to collect his pay, but this Is not
a rigid requirement.
Before the late Major Washburn's
body had become cold in death the ap
plicants had commenced their cam
paigns. Each one brought along his
good morals and his "pull." They wore
out the linoleum getting into the Jus
tices* chambers. To save the place
from WTeck a meeting of the Jurists
was called. It Is related that Justices
Lorigan, Henshaw and McFarland . be
lieved Sam Horton was the best man
for the place. Justices Ang'ellottl, Shaw
and Van Dyke are said to have favored
the aspirations of J. F. Berleim, once
captain of the guard at San Quentin.
Chief Justice Beatty was firm In the
belief that M. W. Davis, turnkey at
Folsom. would fill the bill.
A formal vote .was taken, but as a
majority of one was necessary for elec
tion, the difficulty "remained. None of
the \ jurists showed any Inclination to
change his mind and the meeting was
adjourned. "When some Justice is pre
pared to change his mind a bailiff may
be chosen.
The Justices of the Supreme Court
are In a deadlock over the appointment
of a bailiff,' whose duties will be to look
wise and draw $125 a month for life.
The numerous candidates for the posi
tion besiege the Justices' chambers on
the seventh floor of the Parrott build
ing day and night. The Jurists would
like to be friendly with every man who
applies, but there Is only one Job of
which to dispose. Each candidate Is
backed by a small army of friends,
who are anxious to tell what their
man might do as bailiff.
It was decided to hold the next meet-
Ing of the presbytery at St. John's new
church, Richmond district, of which the
Rev. George G. Eldredge is pastor.
The Rev. y William Martin, D. D., of
Santa Rosa/ spoke on "Eschatology". be
fore the Presbyterian Ministers' Union
Jesterday.
"The Courtship of Miles Standish," was
the subject of a paper read yesterday
by the Rev. William Rader before the
Congregational Ministers* Union at the
Ycung Men's Christian Association build-
Ing.
A call was given to Mr. Parker. by the
.congregation -of Olivet Presbyterian
Church, which he accepted- He and the
Rev. William Kirk Guthrie were ap
pointed a committee to arrange for the
installation. The Rev. Mr. LaughUn will
moderate the installation meetings the
Rev. J. M. McElhinney will give i the
cnarge to the pastor and the Rev. Rich
mond Logan the charge to the people.
The installation takes place Friday even
ing June 2. at 7:30 at Olivet Church.
The questions for ordination were pro
pounded by the Rev. J. H. Laughlin.
moderator of presbytery- The ministers
present placed their right hand upon the
ln-ad of the candidate, while Professor
I^andon v cf the San Francisco Theologi
cal Seminary delivered the prayer.
The ministers then gave the right hand
of fellowship to the ordained and wel
comed him to take part with them In the
ministry.
REV. MR. PARKER GEIS CALL.
At the meeting of the presbytery at the
Presbyterian Mission Hall. S2O Sacramen

\\\ E. Parker Jr. were licensed to preach
fend the Rev. P. G. Stevens was or
dainf-o an evangelist. Mr. Stevens is in
charse of the Franklin-street Presbyteri
an Church.
Zion at a town is as dead as one of thoee

of the railroad. Zion is impossible, and while
I do rot wish to pose a* a prophet even

"Dowie la not a facatlc. but a concen
trated egotist, craving notoriety and lead
ership; he la a cold-blooded hypocrite,"
declared Dr. F. D. Bovard at the Meth
odlet preachers' meeting yesterday morn
ing In the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church on Mission street. Dr. Bovard. '
who Is the editor of the Christian Advo
cate, was telling of his recent visit to
Zlon City and took occasion to make a
scathing arraignment of the "First Apos
tle" John Alexander Dowie. Dr. Bovard
Net elnc* the daya wbeo Brlrb&m Young
founded the Co-operative Zion In Salt Lake
City, through which the Mormon hierarchy
Ceecea the eaJsts. has there been such a ;
â¢chetse of tyrannous communism. I talked
\u25a0 "with the town" and found out what wa*
coins* en under the crust of Zlon. I visited
the "hescice" and I asked upon what con
ditiona patients were admitted to the hospital.
The clerk Indignantly replied. "This Is no
hospital; It Is a hospice." and that unless
I had the czaailpox. the buboalc plasue or
seme other contagious disease I could come
In for the regular rates, from (3 to $3 a day.
The "hespice" looked very much like a san
itarium and the guÂ«sts looked like they were
eil there "for their health."
In conversation with the school children
they tald. â¢"Oh, yea, we get elck, but we \u25a0
pray, aad If ""** don't get well we send for
the elders and they pray aad we do what
they tell us."
I then asked. "Do all the children who
become alck get well?" ~ They answered. "Oh.
no. Quite a number have- died." The children
then caw they were getting Into deep water
ar.d ecacipered away In a dazed and exn
barrasted manner.
I then met a Zionist carpenter. I asked him
how It came to pass that the "first apostle"
" ts running a hospital. He said they were
not allowed to call It a hospital, but he
eaid many sick came there - and owing to
lack of faith they had to be cared for. Some i
rot well, come died. somÂ« went away as .
th^y came.
He said that so far aa sickness and health
!n the Zlon City were concerned Zlon was
the dfflc as any other city. There were many
people who pot sick and through lack of faith
died.

RAILROADS IN CHINA.
THE Chinese dug canals and used their rivers for boating be
cause they would not by such means of transportation offend
their dead and gone ancestors "by invading their tombs or dis
turbing their rest by the noise of land traffic. But economic laws
seem capable of finally overcoming all things, even superstition.
There is much commerce and travel by canal between Shang
hai, Soochau and Hangchau. This trade has been carried in steam
launches and three companies catered for it, the Tai Sun Chong;
the Taito and the China Merchants line. They were actual com
petitors and the business increased very rapidly. But in 1903 they,
combined, went into a transportation trust, in fact) and put up
prices. Then the trade began to be diverted to the slow going junks
and there is so much discontent with the situation that the traders
and natives are demanding a railroad to relieve them of "the ex
actions of water transportation. So pronounced is this demand,
that the natives offer to waive the right of their ancestors and lef
a right of way be had, provided it does not run through any family
tomb. v:K'V'.v:
In 1902, before the launch trust was formed, 250,709 natives
traveled from Hangchau to Shanghai, which shows extraordinary,
mobility for Chinese. The freight in silk and tea carried was very
large, and after the combine, tea freight was put up to $1 80 per
lon and silk to $1 70 and coal to $1 50. As the distance is only 150
miles these rates seem high for water carriage. They have quite
seriously affected trade and the merchants and even the peasants
end operatives seem to have a regular American fever for a railroad.
The situation is worth inspection by our American railroad
builders. The franchise, if granted, will go to Chinese, but they
will need the services 'of builders from this country^ If this road
be built by the withdrawal of the opposition of superstition, it may
well mean an industrial awakening in other parts of China by the
construction of railway lines that will favorably affect the trade of
the world with that empire.

Newfoundland has recently developed
a new Industry, which is stated to be a
successful one, namely, that of placing
on the market whale flesh in place of
beef. Whale meat tastes more like ven
ison than beef, and is quite a tempting
article- of diet. A -firm intends shortly
to try a shipment to the English market.
The meat has already been shipped in
large quantities to the West Indies,
where it 1* much appreciated by the
natives. . .
The Fish and Game Commission has jurisdiction over the
waters of the State. It has the same power to prevent their pollu
tion by oil that the State Board of Health has to protect them
against sewage. Our public waters not only make a very necessary
addition to the food supply by the fish they furnish, but they are
the resort of our edible water fowl. During the past winter duck
hunters found the ducks disabled and made unfit for food and, in
deed, being destroyed by the oil which soaked their plumage while
they were swimming and feeding on the bay and its estuaries. *
It is not necessary to discharge oil or oil waste into the bay
or into streams. It is a violation of the right of the public to the
full enjoyment of the waters of the State and the use of their re
sources. We hope the Fish and Game Commission will take coun
sel in time and stop this abuse before it has gone so far that stop
ping it will do no good.
r T"*HE Board of Health is doing important work in diverting city
I sewage from the streams of California. This is well. Water
is a conveyer of disease and should be protected against pol
lution.
The waters of California, fresh and salt, are being badly injured
by oil. Since the use of our fuel oil became general and oil plants
were established on the various harbors of our coasts, and oil wells
ha\e been bored near running streams, and oil fuel has been dis
tributed to power plants on our navigable streams, the entire food
rish supply is in danger of being destroyed. Fishermen have in
dicted the sealions at the Cliff House for living on a fish diet, and
the destruction of those interesting animals has been proposed.
Other herds on the coast have been reduced by official action and
order. The sealions consume but a very small percentage of the
migraton,' fish which enter the bay from the ocean, while oil in the
water threatens to destroy them all. It is a common thing to see
acres of water on the bay covered by a film of oil. The oil boats
which carry the fuel up the rivers waste oil into the stream and it
floats down to tide water on the current. '

BOBBIE ON DANCES.
MANY pages are devoted by The Call this morning to a review
of Nevada, our sister State. A special Nevada edition is
issued, in the preparation of which men eminent in all call
ings, residents of Nevada, have collaborated. The result is placed
before readers with confidence that the great amount of information
it contains and the pictorial features that illustrate it will justify the
large expense that has been, incurred by. the management of The Call
in its preparation, and that it will be of immediate and lasting benefit
to the great State that is California's neighbor, on the east of the
Sierras.
As a review of Nevada it may be asserted without reservation
that it is the first to be complete. United States Senator Nixon, Con
gressman Van Duzer, Governor Sparks, members of the learned
faculty of Nevada State University, mining men of great means and
marked achievements and capitalists have personally contributed in
formation. Nevada journalists have, with loyalty to the common
wealth in which they dwell, given their time and labors cheerfully
to have Nevada brought to the attention of the world.
From all points of view, therefore, The Call publication of to
day is exceptionally wide in scope and has authenticity imparted to
it by the names and abilities of the writers. It is with pleasure that
The Call becomes the medium through which significant facts, indi
cating a glorious future for Nevada, are disseminated. During a
period of years The Call has devoted attention to promoting the de
velopment of the Pacific Coast as a whole and of the individual
States and Territories. The entire field has been constantly under
survey â north and south, east and west.
Familiarity with the needs and resources of the people of the
coast has been acquired. No State has a more hopeful and sug
gestive story to tell than that which, this morning, in these columns,
represents progressive Nevada.
Writers point out the vast wealth that has been discovered in
Nevada's newer mining camps. The great prosperity that will come
to Nevada as the result of the turning of water by the Federal Gov
ernment upon great areas of fertile soil, that awaits only the enliven
ing touch of moisture to blossom as the rose^is suggested. Culture
is represented by the merits of the State university and the influences
that emanate from it. Climate, treasures in mines, broad acres that
will soon be the seat of new cities and towns, prospective agricultural
development on a large scale, companionship with a brave, hardy and
genial people â these are among the inducements held out to home
seekers to dwell in and share the fortune Nevada offers.
The attractions are great. The ability to fulfill promises is com
mensurate. Nevada has come into a new era of prosperity. The con
gratulations of The Call are gladly extended upon the showing that
Nevada is now able to make. Nevada will be greater and richer in
the future than in the palmy days of the Comstock.

Isaac Kohn yesterday petitioned the
Board of Supervisors to pass a resolu
tion directing the Tax Collector to mark
raid upon the assessment books the taxes
paid by him, amounting to $4086. Kohn
paid the taxes by check to ex-Tax Col
lector E. J. Smith on April 6, 1905, and
the latter gave Kohn duly receipted tax
bills, but Smith cashed the check and
appropriated the money to his own uses.
Kohn says that Tax Collector Scott will
net assume the authority of making the
entry upon the books without an express
resolution of the board. The taxes of
the Southern Pacific Company, amount
ing to some $39,000. are in the same cate
gory as the checks paid for taxes by the
corporation were also cashed by Smith,
who failed to turn the money into the
city treasury- W. J. Somera and other
taxpayers also paid their taxes in the
fame way and complication will arise as
to whether they should be credited on
the tax books. The petition filed by Kohn
was referred to the Judiciary Committee
and whatever action is taken by the
board will be made thÂ© test for the cred
iting of all taxes collected by Smith, for
which he failed to make return to the
city.
The following business waa also trans
acted at the session:
The board passed to print an ordlnar.ee
declaring Nineteenth street, between Dolores
and Cfeurch. a public boulevard, along- which
Co railroad shall ever be built, and prohibit
ing heavy traffic thereon. A petition had been
r..-d to cloee the two blocks described so they
\u25a0would form part of lhÂ« new Mission Park
which fcas Just been purchased under the bond
iKue. The law. however, prohibits the clos
ing of a Â«rÂ«t more lhan forty feet in width.
so a compromise was effected by declaring the
etreet to be a boulevard for the two blocks.
The ordinance providing the manner in which
expenditures may be authorized from the pub
lic building funds for the construction of
bui'dlngs to be erected under the bond issue
was finally passed. The ordinance provides
that competitive plans Â«h*U be Invited for the
buiidings. with the exception of those which
have already been prepared under previous
bond issues. A supervising architect will
also be anointed. L. Stone having been de
cided urÂ»n for the place.
The petition of the United Railroads for
permission to convert its Ninth. Larkin. Polk
and Sutter street lines into an overhead
tiolley tystera was referred to the joint Public
Utilities. Finance and Street Committee.
Grades were ordered changed on Twenty

Mr*. McCurdy. mother of the laiqpt
wife of George D. Collins, will be called
before the Grand Jury to-day. Acting
Foreman B. J.- Bowes has been gather-
Ing evidence that may contradict ; the
mother-in-law's statement that George
D. Collins and Clarice McCurdy have not
lived together as husband and wife In
California. Bowes will have witnesses
present who will flatly contradict Mrs.
McCurdy's statement. The meeting of
th? Grand Jury will be held in Judge
Lawlor's court at 2 p. m. At that time
Acting "" Foreman Bowes will step* aside
and Foreman T. P. Andrews will again
take the reins.
The District Attorney has been working
on evidence that will enable him to place
further charges against the defaulter.
This will probably result in Judge Lawlor
raising 1 the bonds to cover the full
amount embezzled.
Deputy Tax Collector McCabe reported
yesterday that $30,000 of a delinquency of
5141.000 had been collected. There is $30,
000 that it was not expected would be col
lectable, it representing exempt proper
ty. This leaves a total delinquency of
$Sl.OOO, much greater than usual.
The defaulting Tax Collector will ap
pear In Judge Lawlor's court at 10:30
o'clock to-day for arraignment. No defi
nite announcement as to what his plea
will be has been given out. but it Is un
derstood that he will plead not guilty.
His attitude has changed wonderfully
since his arrest. The extraordinary con
sideration with which the embezzling
prisoner has been treated by the police
ever since his arrival here has instilled
into him the notion that he can '.'beat
the case."
The sudden departure of Ralph Smith,
vice president of the National Surety
Company, puts a puzzling aspect on the
case of Edward J. Smith, the defaulting
Tax Collector.
The National Surety Company official
was to have met Foreman Andrews of
the Grand Jury yesterday, but he left for
the East the nUfht before."
Foreman Andrews declares that he is
In the dark as to the significance of this
move. It is rumored that Ralph Smith's
departure means that friends of the de
faulting Taxv Collector have "fixed
things" with the surety company, which
Is out one-quarter of Smith's total pec
culatlons. Such a settlement, it is saia,
was made In order to draw off the en
mity of the surety company when the
case comes to trial.

Dog's Attack on Girl Cause
"of Fatal Malady That Is
Baffling Medical Science
GOESvINTO CONVULSIONS
While Bite Marks Could
Be Found, Case Is Said
to Eesemble Hydrophobia
A little girl, formerly the embodiment
of J health, now 'wasted'? and frail.: whose
eyes are closed in semi-conscious stupor,
lies . strapped to a bed in the Children's
Hospital, while learned doctors are balk
ed'ln ."prescribing the cure for her ail
ment.?- v.". s"' ,i-- ",*", . : ;.' \u25a0 â¢.â¢ ' .\u25a0;.. \u25a0\u25a0;.'
Some eight months 'ago, \u25a0\u25a0â 10-year-old
Dorothy Feeney of 233 "Waller street was
attacked by a vicious mastiff. The child
was frightened .Into hysterics, which de
veloped into ravings, . and if | aid is not
soon given to the sufferer her death will
result. -
\u25a0 Dorothy, accompanied by her little sis
ter Frances, was on an errand for her
mother at the time she encountered . the
dog.' As they passed the house of Rich
ard McCann, a contractor of 251 "Waller
street, a large. mastiff, .named. Beauty,
belonging to McCann, sprang upon Dor
othy and knocked her to the ground. The
little one screamed with fright and the
dog was called off before doing further
harm. . *
1 When Dorothy ' arrived home, accom
panied by Frances and the little daughter
of McCann, she was in a state of col
lapse from - fright. The 'mother soothed
her and nothing was thought of the oc
currence as there were no marks of the
dog's "teeth on the child's body. Soon af
terward the little girl complained daily
of severe pains in' the head and one after
noon had the first of a series of attacks
that resemble hydrophobia, utterly baf
fling to medical science.
. When the attacks came on, Dorothy's
screams and ravings could be heard by
those passing the' house.- She was strap
ped to her little bed and between convul
sions begged her mother to "take the dog
away: he's biting my hand; he'll kill
me!" The agonized mother did her best
to soothe the patient, but her efforts and
those of Dr. T. E. Shumate, who was
called in. were of no avail.
In her delirium the little girl could not
recognize her' mother or her brother and
two little . sisters. Cocaine and chloro
form were administered to bring relief,
but " with - small ' effect, v In her lucid in
tervals she refuses to eat, and is slowly
dying of exhaustion.
Finally Dr. Shumate, of whom the
mother speaks in grateful terms, succeed
ed in having Dorothy removed to the
French , Hospital. Her cries and ravings
disturbed the other patients and after
six days she was sent home. Later Dr.
Shumate arranged to have her taken to
the Children's Hospital, where she is at
present When the mother visited her
child yesterday the sufferer failed to rec
ognize her. The doctors assured Mrs.
Feeney that the girl was conscious and
knew what vras passing, but seemed too
exhausted even to open her eyes. ,;V-
Dorothy's father was in the hospital
when 'the first j attack came on. Last
April he died,, and the , care and .-.worry.;
over the little patient have devolved upon
the mother, who, it is said, has aged
greatly sinee 1 the trouble. The owner of
the dogr has never visited the mother ribr
Inquired after the little one's condition
or offered to bear a share of. the expense
that his dog has brought upon the wid
owed' mother. McCann is a contractor
and is said to have considerable wealth.

Movements of Steamers.
Gas Holder TovÂ»cd Up the Bay.
The unusual night of seeing a huge gs%
holder, 75 feet In diameter and 3C feet high,
being towed up the bay on a barge caused
much comment along the water front late yes
terday afternoon. The great tank looked like
a big. black balloon as It slowly moved along,
towed by the tug Milton. It loomed up over
everythiag In the harbor as it passed along to
HÂ« destination at the new gas works at the
Potrero. ;- J -- -\u25a0- -1 -
TMs huge tank, which weighs 150 tons, was
originally used it the eld Equitable Gas Works
* plant at the foot of Hyde etreet. When this
-property passed into the hands of the San
'-.Francisco Gas Company that corporation de
\u25a0 cided to dismantle the works. The tank and
one similar to it are to be used as oil tanks
for crude oil In the new plant. Blume & Cram,
who have the contract for moving the tanks,
expect to send the second cne to its new home
Friday. When this is done the old gas works
will be completely dismantled, and the Equita
ble plant 'Rill coon be a thing of the past.

The Pacific Mall Steamship Company
will dispatch the steamship Aztec on or
about June Z as an extra freight . carrier
for Ancon and way ports. This 'action
waa found necessary to meet , the de
mands of the shippers here, who have
large orders for merchandise for south
ern ports.
The Aztec will carry <Â»M tons of
freight, consisting, principally of corn,
flour and wine. Borne of this merchandise
is destined for New York, but the most
of it goes to ports along the southern
coast.
The coast trade has grown tremendous
ly of late. Every regular steamer of the
Pacific Mail has gone loaded to capacity
for several months past. The City of
Para , which Is scheduled to sail on
Thursday for Ancon, has more freight
than she can get away -with, and offer
ings were so large ahead that the com
pany decided to put the Aztec on the
run.
The freighter will go on the drydock,
probably to-day, and will be ready to
begin receiving freight at the little Mail
dock on Friday. May 26. She will be
loaded .to capacity. , / '.-;\u25a0.

NEW YORK, May-- 22.â Requests for
hearings ; from the St. Louis Fair exhib
itors,' who ' are , at present In controversy
with the Louisiana Purchase Exposition
Company over .. the coming, award of
prizes, have been . filed at .the offices of
the National Commission In this city,
but as the commission has less than six
weeks; to live, and proceedings of such a
nature, if started, would last well into
next ; winter, it Is doubtful if the com
missioners will be able to do anything
to give satisfaction to the complainants.
The protesting exhibitors, among whom
are ; some ,' of the most prominent manu
facturers in the country, are opposed to
the ; award of prizes on the ground that
exhibits were Improperly classified and
Judged 'and -.that many of the resulting
awards will be unfair. The act of Con
gress by which ' the National Commission
was. created provides that the awards of
the exhibition company, must officially be
Indorsed \u25a0by â¢ the . commission. This, so
far, has not. been done, and as the com
mission,' by . law, ceases to exist on July
1,., there Is much speculation as to
whether .the .opportunity to .confirm the
decisions will ever be presented. The cer
tificates of awards, it is said, are now
completed' and: only await issuance.

as -Possible, but no Case Is so
Bad but 1 here. ls Great Hope
From the Application of This
Wonderful New Treatment.
Everybody, including ths medical profession,
agrees that It U absolutely useless to try to
cur* consumption by medicines. Fresh air and
plenty of It la about all the medical fraternity
has to offer as a cure, some cases are cured
by fresh zir. Why? Simply because of tha
oxygen that is placed Into the system by it.
Oxygen destroys the germ. One \u25a0 Electro-;
Chemic treatment puts more oxygen Into tha
blood than a' month's breathing of tha purest
mountain air. A wonderful illustration of tns
curative effects of Electro-Chemistry Is thÂ»
cane of Mrs. A. G. Iverson. living at 2015 Cen-
ter street. Berkeley. Mrs. Iverson had the
worst kind of consumption, commonly called
"galloping consumption." In a few months
she had lost twenty pounds In weight. She had
night sweats so bad that the bed clothing was
saturated every night. She had high fever In
the afternoon and a fearful cough. Her homo
physician Maid-that she must go to Arizona as
quickly as possible and live In the desert and
breathe thu pure hot air of that barren wilder-
ness. She must do this, he said, or die In a
tew months. Mrs. Iveraon has two beautiful
children. She could not think of taking them
to such a place, and she could not think of
leaving them behind; so. Instead of following
her doctor's advice, she took the Electro-
Chemlc eoursft at US Grant aye., San Fran-
cisco, and was perfectly cured. This was threa
years ago, and time has proved that her cur* 1b

The Electro-Chemlc home treatment is very

TOWN MAESHAL'S FAULT
[^ ST. LOUIS, May 22.â Peter Busch,
the youngest son of Adolphus Busch,
the .millionaire -.St., Louis brewer, who
died yesterday from an operation for
appendicitis, was a college graduate
and had traveled extensively. During
a year or more spent on the Pacific
Slope he became famous as the great
est "spender* on the coast- During his
stay in. the West his father made him
an ample allowance and he had little
active business of the company to look
after, but ultimately he became tired
of California and asked that he be re
called to St. Louis.
Son of Brewer, Who Died Sunday In
St. Louis. Known as a "Good
Fellow."
YOUNG BUSCH SPENT MONEY
FREELY ON PACIFIC COAST
PORTLAND, May 22.-At Echo, Or., at
a dance held early In May, Governor
George B. Chamberlain of Oregon, United
States Senator Charles "W. Fulton, also
of Oregon; General Manager B. A.
Worthington. who recently resigned from
the head of the northwest division of the
Harrimah system; W. W. Cotton, the
chief counsel of the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company," and several promi
nent railroad and business men were the
victims of the town marshal's wrath. .
The Citizens' Association of Echo gave
a celebration in. honor of the second an
niversary of the organization of that
body. General Manager Worthington at
tended the convention, and with him in
two private cars were the Governor, the
Senator and several other/ well-known
public men of Oregon. Worthington and
his party were invited as guests of the
Citizens' Association, and^the president
of that body,, the Mayor of the town,
made an arrangement with the manager
of the dance to pass all the visitors into
the 'ball free of charge.
-The visiting party went In a body to
the hall and, knowing that arrangements
had been made for their free passage,
walked boldly past the guards at the door.
Worthington was In the lead and headed
for the platform, where seats had been
provided , for him and his friends. The
doorkeeper held up the main bunch while
the marshal went on the trail of Worth
ington'with blcod in his eye. He found
the railroad man, and despite the tatter's
offer to. pay the regular admission 1 fee,
"fired" him and his guests from the hall.
The Mayor of the town met the visitors
as they were making tracks for their
train. His apologies were ample, but
they ' were wasted on the dignitaries.
They refused to co back to the dance.

TCITR' YORK. May 22. â The tone of specu-
Ictrve sentiment undsrwent an abrupt transi
tion during the course of to-day's trading la
stocks. T>eflned rumors of a financial institu
tion in trouble were circulated late in the day.
The Influence en feeling of the violent break
In prices in the latter part of the day was
the mere effective on account of the strength
shown during the morning. -' Last week's
heavy liquidation and the apparent . renewal
of it in the closing hours of Saturday left the
expectation of v-ery heavy selling tOrbe faced.
Tbe good resistance offered by the market this
morning therefore caaae es a surprise, and the
professional traders were inclined to hasten
to make commitments on the losg side of the
market. The receipt of considerable -.- buying
orders from London gave an impression also
cf revived cor.fl<3encÂ« in. our securities on that
ride of the- ocean. There was no news to ac
count for the eudden accession of selling power
!n the market, the orders to sell appearing sim
ultaneously In many quarters and from an un
known origin. The market had come practi
cally to a standstill before they appeared and
this tad a discouraging effect on those hopeful
tor a further advance. Tho upward movement
gave Impression of having been fostered
lor the purpose of affording a better basis for
further liquidation, and the suspicion got
abroad that large and important Interests wÂ«w
setting out or their holdings of some o' the
most important Etecks-in the market. The
abrupt drop in Northern Pacific was of soeclal
influence on eentiaent.- It Is now believed
i? at .- th **f onnaUoa la " week ot the Northern
Pacific dlrectorat/.- may be accepted as tha
definite conduElcc of any. harmony plans that
may. have beepj in contrmplaUon end any acS
compasyiag hepes of the high values to be
developed tn- all Northwestern stock* by a
coiaparatlve plan to conserve all . interests.

â¢â¢General report credits the epot prune mar
ket Â«ith a very strong tone, but prices do not
improve. The strength of the spot situation
appears to be based more upon the prospect of
* light crop this season than upon any Increase
cf buying interest. As previously stated the
Middle West has been of late fending more
orders to thÂ« coast for prompt shipments, but
buyers in this ecction do not enthuse over the
situation and display no speculative interest.
Tfce situation on th* coast in regard to epot
supplies is held by leading interests there to
be a very etrong one. in the face of the fact
that the coming crop In Santa- Clara Valley
premises net to exceed a quarter of a full
output., while in other sections, as claimed,
the situation Is almost as bad. From the
fame 6ourcÂ« the report comes that there, are
ver;' few good prunes of the 1904 crop left on
the coast. In other California dried fruit* on
the epot the market is very quiet, and futures
appear to attract no attention. \u25a0 Supplies of
raisins are very Fmall and as the consuming
trade, if the usual experience Is repeated, is
expected to need a considerable quantity for
actual use during the next few week* those
who have any stock are fiiepoeed to hold It
firmly at the quoted prices. Offerings of Email
resale, lots of epot peaches continue and the
market if eaay. Epot apricots are In limited
cemaad and fairly firm. Little Interest is
thotra in Epot currants, but there is no dispo
sition among holders to shade prices as an In
ducement to buyers."

Ftrength for a time, but big selling was re

selling represented liquidation, but there was
also a great deal of bear pounding. The at

Bonds were weak. Total sales, par 'value,
$3,300,000. United States bonds were all un
changed oil call.
There Is a disposition to account for the per
sistent and determined liquidation as belug
due largely to the retirement of holdings ac
quired at one or another stage of the at
tempted settlement in the Northwest. Another
Important sentimental influence was . the re
newed weakness of the United States Steel
stocks. Reassuring assertion* from authori
ties In the trade of the light Importance to be
attached to the present lull in that trade are
of little effect on sentiment in the face ot the
practical- weakness of. these stocks In the mar
ket and the prevalence of j\e doubts of the
stability of the iron and stfcel trade bring
ing into question the wholÂ© business outlook.
Railroad traffic officials admitted some fall
ing off in business on account of. crop uncer
tainties, and the strength of wheat, to-day
on the weather in the Southwest augmented
this Influence. Some of the weakness of epe
clal stocks was attributed to the renewed cam
paign by advertising methods In favor of sell

ing on the day's decline, but pressure was re
newed and tho dosing was easy. \u25a0 \u25a0j-

Mrs. Cecil Itomer, who was promi
nent as an artist and also one, of the
principal witnesses "relied j upon by:^l*
M. Sherwood arid his wife, proponents
of the will 0f ... the. late "Mammy"
Pleasant, who made them her sole de
visees, died . yesterday at the City and
County Hospital.
Though she passed away at a charity,
institution, Mrs. Romer had a - brother
in Los Angeles, Colonel Edwin R. Fox,
a man, who Is reputed ~ to v be
wealthy." He was here at the time his
sister was sent to the hospital and left
her in, that institution when he' re
turnedito Los Angeles. .
-That which Mrs. Romer would have
told, in ' the hearing of : the "Mammy"
Pleasant" will case -will perhaps |rio-w
never be known. - The ( artist . had told
Sherwood- and "his wife, so it is said,
tti&t -she>.would have something Im
portant- tb-say-'on; the' stand, had
lived:for ; .years:at 441 Point Lobos ave
nue. "Above her.lived Mrs.VA-J.; Street.
To \u25a0 Mrs. ' Street she. said j that "Mammy"
Pleasant had been in the habit of com
ing to her;rooms, stuffing; the' keyhole
In the door with cotton'^and -dictating
to her; for, hours, almost' iris a' whisper.
The secret of what she wrote, for this
mysterious negress who cast her weird
spell over V wealthy wllite' family, has
probably died with- her.' \u25a0 . , ."/,
Colonel' Fox took'n'ea'rly "all of his
sister's effects with hlrn -,tb Los An
geles, saying he was going to fit her
up a studio there with her original be
longings. Mrs. Street says -he men
tioned finding among, the eight
deeds "that he could not understand."
It is thought these deeds may have come
from "Mammy" Pleasant. .
Mrs. Romer had - estranged herself
from her relatives, being eccentric, and
she had not seen her .brother for fif
teen years prior to April ' 26, when .he
arrived here. She had two sisters.. one
a clerk in the pension office at Wash
ington, the other private secretary for
a, wealthy woman. .' ... ;

The foregoing is but a small part
of the.- heart-rending, incredible
story of pretty 17-year-old Mrs.
Annie Slegrist, who attempted to
asphyxiate herself and baby yes
terday. So harrowing is her tale of
cruelty and hardship that vagaries of
a disordered mind are suspected:
Married at 15 years of age, the un
fortunate woman lived four 5 months
with a brutal husband. She says he
that her mother was bad? I'd die first.
*\u25a0 "I thought the insult more and niore
cruel. I was alone. I decided that I
would kill myself and murder the baby..
When I .got home this afternoon 1 1 , was
seized with a violent impulse to do the
deed at once and end-all misery for
us both. Then I; seized the /child,
clutched. her little throat- and tried. to
choke her. Her f&ce got red and she"
cried; looking into my face "with a piti
ful stare. I couldn't' do it.; I released
my grip. \u25a0 The - thought appalled me.'y 1
sat down, nursed the baby and turned
on the gas."
Mrs." J Siegrlst was found by roomers
at 1116 Mission street about 6 o'clock
i last night. She was sent to the Central
Emergency Hospital. She begged Dr.
Tillman to kill her. .
"Kill .me. kill me;" she shouted. "Oh,
let' me die.' They â¢ said : I*. was a bad
woman, but they â¢ knew^ not what they
said. Oh God, let : me die. Take care
of my baby. l Educate her and keep her,
good and pure." \u0084 ; ,
Screaming : and ' fighting the young
mother, writhing in agony, was. treated
against her will. ;; IThe- , surgeons
strapped her to a bed so that she might
not do herself bodily harm,* for; she
said she would will herself should she

Crying hunger forced her to steal from

HARROWING STORY.
The prosecution closed its case yester
day afternoon against Joseph Rebstock.
Indicted for violation of the election law
when an officer of a primary election
precinct. While Fred , Hancock, the first
'witness for the defense, was testifying.
Attorney O*Grady rose in his wrath and
said that Fairfax H. Wheelan was mak
ing noises with his mouth and shaking
his head so as to impress the jury with
the fact *hat the witness was not telling
the truth. The Judge said it was wrong
for Wheelan to do that, and O'Grady
said he would file affidavits in the morn-
Ing bearing out his statement.
Wilber C. Knox, Fairfax H. Wheelan
and Albert E. .Whitney testified to votes
being challenged and to Rebstock's re
fusal to administer the oath. They also
testified to the vile language used by
Rebstock. Wheelan said that Rebstock
had remarked that they could send him
to the State's prison If they liked, but he
would not administer the oath. When a
challenge was made as to an Inmate of
the Almshouse, Rebstock would say,
"Oh, , he'll vote, anyway."*
Attorney Newburg, in his opening
statement for the defense, asserted he
would prove that there was a conspiracy
on the part of Wheelan, Hazell and
Fitzgerald to â¢ prevent Inmates Itj the
Almshouse from voting. The defendant
was employed in the Street-sweeping De
partment by Mayor Schmitz. and therein
lay **the milk of the cocoanut." The de
fendant had been so harassed and an
noyed by. so many challenges that he
might have usÂ«d strong language. He
would also Drove that the challenges
were not properly made. â¢
Fred Hancock, janitor at the Mer
chants' Exchange, was the first witness
for . the defense. .He was ona of the
judges at the Almshouse booth and re
mained from the opening of the polls till
the votes were counted. HÂ« declared
that Rebstock was administering the
oath all the time. His examination was
not concluded when court adjourned till
this morning.
â¢ Frank A. Maestretti, Commissioner of
Public Works, was an interested specta
tor in .court. His case was called yester
day moinins ar.d was set for trial on
May 31. He was indicted for fraudulently
attempting to induce a person to give
false testimony. The trial was set for
May 31 under the objection of his attor
ney, who wanted an earlier hearing.

Jury. United States District Attorney

who has .been put in charge. Frederick
S."Stratton, Collector of the Port, sat
by the side of the prosecuting officers
and frequently \ advised with them-
The wife, daughter and son of the de
fendant occupied seats in the court
room. :
, Bert Schlesinger of counsel for Unger
was assisted by. Attorney Seth'Mann, a
life-long friend of the defendant.
-"William Hamilton, special deputy,
told how he had met Unger by appoint
ment on' October 16 last year. It was
on a Sunday, and Unger informed him
that he had failed to deposit certain
money.: with the cashier, but would do
so on the following day. On the Tues
day following Unger said he was go
ing ;to, resign and handed over to Mr.
Hamilton a sack containing $1505 In
gold ;coin, which" was in full of all de
mands that could be made against him
by the Government. .
Clement G. Perkins, cashier of the
Custom-house, testified that Unger de
posited, money with him every day. -
.rEllis A. Holmes testified that on Oc
tober 24. he was detailed to take charge
of the seizure-room. Unger told him
that t^here had been a shortage and
that he expected -to resign and go Into
business. The witness had a conver
sation'with him at his house later,
when = Unger expressed regret that the
thing had happened.
Collector - Stratton, on being recalled,
said -that Unger had asked his permis
sion to remain in the office for a while,
for. if he should absent himself abrupt
ly.'the newspaper reporters would no
tice it and then the whole matter might
become public. The witness allowed
him. to remain â¢ until October 20, but
did not' permit' him to perform any of
the duties of. the office.
The witness then told of his having
started. the Investigation on September
30. Thai was a holiday and the wit
ness went to his. office for. the purpose
of consulting data as material for a
speech to be delivered by him. He
found Mr. Farmer there and while they
were talking a package of money came
up from the Postofflce to be checked by
the seizure clerk and then sent down
to the cashier. .
"I; told Mr. Farmer, that that was
against my positive instructions and I
demanded of him that he should begin
an investigation of the accounts of
the seizure clerk's office," added Mr.
Stratton.
The trial will be resumed at 11 a. m.
to-day.

I had tried many different remedies, .
but none of them did me any good.
I was growing worse when I tried

The names of Nevada' mining camps, of recent origin, have
already become world famous. , More millions may be produced'
by any of them than made for the Comstock lode a place in his
tory. Not even a mining expert can make an estimate which may
not be largely .exceeded in realization.
Men who are familiar with Nevada have written articles for
this edition of The Call. Governor John Sparks arid United
States Senator Nixon are among- the contributors. Governor
Sparks declares that permanent prosperity has ' come to Nevada,
and that bettered conditions are permanent. He speaks fromin-'
timate knowledge of all the facts, as the State's chief executive.
.What he has written is worthy of the attention of every thought-
Governor Sparks believes -in a great future for Nevada,;
and gives cogent reasons .for his belief. Not less cogent is Sen-
aior Nixon. Others add- facts that, collectively,, constitute a great
story of natural resources and vast prospects. " .
Mining men and capitalist s hold the opinion that â¢ Governor.
Sparks is correct. In pursuance of this, they.- have already^ invest-;
ed millions of dollars, and these millions are but the forehnmers;
of even greater investments -when all the facts are known.
THE story of the great resources of the opulent State of Ne
vada is told in The Call this morning. Nevada is amazing
the world with its wonderful discoveries of minerals. Many
millions in gold have been taken from Nevada's mines. Incal
culable wealth, embodied in its auriferous rocks, still remains to re
ward the enterprise that seeks it. ;

NEVADA is witnessing the dawn of a new era. Many causes !
are contributing ; to bring about a great degree of prosper- "
< ; ity for the Sagebrush State. â¢ Agriculture and stock raising,
the large increase of population that will attend mining and -the >
- irrigation of lands now arid, the 'construction of railroads and the j
\u25a0 opening up of ; new. sections,; with additional mineral and trade de- .
â¢: vÂ§lopments, r are among the factors of progress. Great as thepres- ;
;-ent looks, the future' bids fair to far surpass it
More energy and enterprise are observable in Nevada than at
any time for many years. Men of money and men of brains from
all parts of the world are flocking into the State with confidence
that is based upon experience and trained business judgment.
Towns are springing into existence' where, until now, '.there >
have been only deserts. No condition that 'makes for splendid suc
cess for Nevada is Jacking. â¢ '
r The climate of /Nevada is .'favorable for.the development of '.
a strong race of men arid .women, .who will work wonders with'
'; the* rich- opportumties that nature affords. Lands. that have been \u25a0
considered waste ; are found to be^prolific in minerals; soils that

At Palisade ores are shipped !n from
Eureka by the train load and taken to
mills for treatment. An extensive ter
ritory full of mineral Is found alons
the roads in Eureka County, many mines
being bullion producers, and others un

At Humboldt immense bodies of sul
phur are reached so pure that every
blast. fires the mine. Three and a half
nuiiion" pounds were shipped in 1902.
Opposite the station a noble ranse
of snow capped mountains have great
bodies of ore. Millions have been taken
out at different places, Unionville. The
Sheba group and elsewhere.
Battle Mountain Is one of the impor
tant stations for the miner. There are
many flourishing camps within a radius
of a dozen miles," mostly poor men's
camps, as they are called because they
do not reuire large Investments to mine
the ores and get 'them to the custom
mills.
ITC3IBOLrÂ»T*S DEPOSITS.
Humboldt County is said to contain
every 1 metal known to science. Nickel,
cobalt. . tin, zinc, bismuth, aluminum,
come into Lovelock from the east, be
sides borax, sulphur and many other
products of the pick. On the road half
"way between the nickel mines and the
railroad lies a body jof magnetic iron
which can be hammered out in a forge.
It covers mlles-of mountain range and
promises to become a great source, of
wealth when opened up for shipment.
In a book recently published by an
thority of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, a picturesque and truthful story
is told that illustrates the wealth of
minerals that have been found near
Reno. The story is as follows ;
"While the famous old mines at Vlr*
ginia City. Austin. Eureka. Tuscarora
and elsewhere are still being worked
and still support substantial towns,
there are -so many new camps showisg:
up that interest centers in them. The
history of some â¢of them is . veritable
romance. One- within sight of Reno
lies on a rounded hill which has been
trodden over for forty years. An honest
piano tuner named George Wede&tnd,
who has spent the last half of bis lons
life in Nevada, putting in every idle
hour looking for gold, found metal in the
dirt of the road below the present mine.
He dug steadily day after day for five
years and in 1900 turned up a shovelful
of earth which felt different from the
rest. It was assayed and showed
54335 S7 in gold and silver, and the vein
proved both large and rich. He ship
ped many car loads, never selling one
load for less than SSSOO net and finally
disposed of his rights to Governor John
Sparks, who has erected mills and is
shipping bullion steadily."
At "Wadsworth the stages go north
to a fine gold \u25a0 camp in , Ollnghouse,
where a dozen mines are paying divi
dends, and south, where silver, gold,
soda, salt, copper and other valuable
materials abound. .-.-,-
Arrangements have been made for
pumping the water from the Comstock
mines and the expense will be borne
jointly by a group of companies. All
operations in this regard will be con
ducted jointly and In the pursuance
of a fixed and well matured plan, by,
which economy of operation la secured.
Many great discoveries may yet bo
made in the lower levels of the Corn
stock mines. Virginia City stands
ready to be benefited by any futnra
developments.
WEDEKCTIVS DISCOVERT.
Reno, in. addition to being the seat
"of the University of Nevada, is a pros
pective jobbing center for a largo ter
ritory and it possesses ' many elements
of future greatness by reason of its
surroundings. Large transportation In
' terests have considered favorably a
plan to give a trade territory, which
can easily bo accomplished ' by ' the In
stitution of what are known as graded
railroad rates. Near Reno are valua
ble mines that are yielding rich re
tarns to their owners. Cattle raisins
and the livestock industry 'generally
bring in large sums annually. _ ,-'
Reno is situated in, the "fertile val
ley of the Truckeo and is surrounded
on all sides by majestic mountains. It
is the metropolis of Nevada. Beauti
fully situated, its charms are enhanced
by fine buildings and grounds \u25a0 and
through it meanders the Trttckee
River. The University of -Nevada is on
an eminence in the northern : part :of
the city. /' '
- * The preent banking and commercial
connections of Reno are large. The
city has had a. steady and rapid growth
during the past few years and was,' in
fact, the first Nevada city to have a
business awakening. Its educational
institufions arÂ«>**the chief pride of tha
people. Social life in Reno is charm
ing. '
The climate of Reno has made the
city to some extent. - The air is clear
jand bracing. The health of the resi
dents Is excellent, a fact due to \u25a0 the
existing conditions. Thtce are few
disagreeable days in the year. The
rainfall is slight. The sky ts almost
always clear. The air is full of ozone
and comfort and stimulus are in every

in the winter. Such is the aspect of
Douglas County,' a perfect model of a
well regulated agricultural district. The
unrivaled: prosperity of this growing
community, is due to individual thrift
and energy, a conservative expenditure
of money and labor, and the naturally
favored conditions and situation of the
valley. A reliable water right is the
most essential thing in a* country that

When Thomas Edison -was in Nevada,
something: more than twenty-nve years
asro, he was struck by the vast expanse
of sagebrush, and remarked that the
Lqrd never put so much or any one
thing in a place without a definite
object. Edison believed that some ons
would eventually discover some com
mercial quality in the sagebrush which
would render it very valuable.
- There are other valleys In Western
Nevada â¢which have the same excellent
soil and irrigation facilities guaranteed
in Carson Valley. This, of course, is a
new industry here, but when Its success
has been once demonstrated there are
many thousands. of acres' of land in Ne
vada especially adapted to the culture
of the sugar beet. It is understood that
if this project . is : successfully carried
out a sugar retlnery will be built on the
ground.
The soil of Carson Valley Is well
adapted 'to beet raising-, and it is pro
posed to colonize a portion of the Dang
berg ranch by cutting it up into twenty
acre tracts and bringing Eastern fami
lies into the country to till the soiL The
almost- perpetual sunshine of the sum
mer months lias a great deal to do with
the sucrose in the beet, and sunshine
can always be depended upon here.
It will require about $600,000 as an
initial expense to set this project under
way and this amount has already been
pledged by an Eastern firm.
$75,000. worth of property on the
ground; including a mill and cyanide
plant. These will start up as soon as a
force of men can be secured and it ia
expected that the output will be unu
sually large. The ore on the dumps
represents a fortune, , while a true fis
sure vein of considerable width pro
vides an almost unlimited deposit to be
extracted as work progresses. I The beat
from these mountains is yet to be ex
tracted, and those interested in mines
there at present are most sanguine over
the prospects.
The largest property under. one man
agement is that owned by the Dangberg
Land and Cattle Company. â¢ At the pres
ent time the company controls some
thing over 55,000 acres, including farm
ing lands and mountain ranges. A large
portion : of this land is under cultiva
tion, producing from four to five tons
of alfalfa and â¢ grass hay to the acre.
This spring something like 10,000 ad
ditional acres have been cleared of
sagebrush -by the novel method of
drowning it out Each year a con
siderable amount of new land is
put under cultivation in addition;to the
already large farm.' The number ox
cattle on the ranges ia increased pro
portionately, the average yearly output
being about 4000 head . Most of these
_are shipped to Kentucky and other
Eastern markets.

the corn-fed meats of the States east of
the Rocky Mountains. , .
Mining, has been carried on with
various degrees ; of success ever since
the early, discovery of . gold. Tho Pine
Nut Mountains, forming the . southeast
ern boundary of the valley, are partic
ularly rich in gold. Many important
mines are located here and in the past
'some ' exceptionally rich ore has been
extracted. Tne richest mineral was
found. ln pockets, though some fine per
manent ledges have been uncovered anu
are being developed at the present time.
Eastern capitalists have been investi
gating these properties this spring and
it is reasonably expected that active
operations will begin in the near.fu-
CARSOX VALLEY.
Carson Valley, Douglas County, is
south of Carson City and extends thir
ty-five miles to the snow capped moun
tains that inclose the adjoining valley.
The western peaks rise almost perpen
dicularly from the level cultivated land
to a height of from 10.000 to 12,000 feet
and are gorgeous with their shimmering
covering of snow during a greater por
tion of the. year. From the deep snow
packed ravines near the summit flow
innumerable streams of clear, cold
water, bounding with frantic haste over
steep, rocky cliffs, reach the plain,
there to .wend peacefully 'through
the comfortable * farms, . bringing
unbounded â prosperity to.- all with
in reach of their ever .valuable
waters. The Carson Hirer * forms the
main channel of this. natural irrigation
system. It - runs \u25a0 lengthwise through
the central portion of - the .valley, with
two large forks branching -to the east
and west. Thus water is available to
nearly .all of the fertile soil.* Â« . ;
This valley is most beautrfuL_ with its
broad â¢ expanse of level, catretrrfly cultV-
an automobile has run between Carson
and the springs for the benefit of its
patrons.
. Agriculture forms a major portion of
the industries of the valley, the town
being encircled with prosperous farms
of varied sizes. Small fruits, apples,
pears and plums are raised in abund
ance, while potatoes, hay and grain
form the principal crops. The soil is
very productive, insuring a good yield
from whatever may be planted, wheat,
oats and barley and rye being raised
without irrigation. . . , . \u25a0 .
A company of enterprising men have
recently secured 500 acres of land to
the south of the city and are placing it
under cultivation as rapidly as possible.
The ground is being cleared, fenced and
planted to grain. Deep wells are being
bored for irrigation purposes and elec
tric pumping plants will be installed.
This experiment, which can hardly fail,
will mean much to the State as well as
the city, when its success is an estab
lished fact and the ranch placed upon a
paying basis. There are thousands of
acres of land in Nevada lying idle for
want of a sufficient water supply, and if
It is demonstrated that pumping plants
are practicable, Nevada's future will bo
permanently assured. This applies par
ticularly to land beyond the reach of
the great Truckee irrigation canal and
other natural water channels.
A GOOD STOCK YEAR."
Western Nevada as a favored locality
for stock- raising. was ; never better il
lustrated' when the winter of '90 broke
every stockman in the section by its
unwonted severity. Ninety-live per
cent of the stock perished on the ranges
and the loss was not fully realized un
til the melting snows of the spring un
covered their carcasses heaped in the
ravines. There are few countries where
such stockmen could- have recuperated
from such wholesale losses, but the Ne
vada stockman has the indomitable
mountain spirit which docs not falter
when fortune strikes bedrock. They
were all up and doing â¢ the following
year and beginning to rebuild their
fortunes. They are most of them bet
ter tixed financially than ever and they
believe in the Indian tradition that a
really devastating winter only, strikes
Nevada once in forty years and the next
is not due for some time yet.
Nevada has just passed through a
very mild open, winter and with the wet
spring the forago is thick upon the
hills. The bunch grass seeded down
splendidly and even the flinty, barren
parts of the hills are mantled with
lilleree.
This last mentioned foragcplant is of
recent growth in Nevada. It made its
first appearance about ten* years ago ..;
Nevada, its seeds having been brought
across the mountains eitner by the high
winds or possibly on the backs of sheep.
The seeds of the. Spanish fodder plant,
alnlltria. more commonly called "lil
leree,"' has a number of little spiral
shaped filaments which cause it to cling
to anything with -which it comes in 1
contact.
It seeds, down very rapidly and for
the past ten years, from a few scatter
ing plants, it has made its way steadily
over the State, and now the hills, once
so bare of vegetation, seem a congenial
soil for this plant of tenacious growth.
It does not attain the heavy growth
which characterizes it in Mexico and
Southern California, but it never/leaves
a place where it has once taken root,
and this year appears to have been very
favorable to it. It furnishes very fat
tening fall feed for stock of all kinds
and they do not seem to care for it
green. They relish it most when it 'is
dried and withered.
. Aliniirs in the. immediate vicinity, of
Caraon is not carried on to any very,
great extent. Several mines that were
operated successfully in the past are
closed at present, not being rich enough
to compete with the wonderful discov
eries, in Southern Nevada. The gutter
of those mines has blinded all men to
anything less astounding in richness
nearer home."
Situated about two miles northeast of
Carson is Shaws Hot Springy, well
known for tbe medicinal properties of
its water. Several years agro the orig
inal spring was destroyed by an earth
quake. A second \u25a0 and better one was
soon uncovered and the flow has been
most satisfactory ever since. The water
is highly mineralized, making- the bath
an excellent cure for rheumatism and
ti"iil&r afflictions. During- the last year
The Stewart Institute, more common
ly called the Indian school, is about
three miles south of the city. This
training school was established in Car
son through the efforts of Senator Wil
liam M. Stewart several years ago
THE STEWART INSTITUTE.
The Nevada State Prison is about two
miles to the east of the town, at the
foot of a mountain of almost solid rock.
The ttone that was hewn from this nat
ural quarry for the. State Capitol and
other buildings left an excavation per
fect in Us adaptability for a prison site.
The buildings and walls are of stone"
while the rocky mountain forms two
sides of the inclosure.
The new OrphamV Home has recently
been completed and is -one of the finest
buildings in the State.
The city is very ably represented by
two newspapers, the Morning Appeal
and thÂ«! Carson City News, an evening
paper. The Appeal is the oldest paper
in the State published continuously
having- be*n established about 1564.
The News has recently enlarged its
plant and is now fully equipped to do
all kinds of printing, bookbinding and
ruling. Both offices make use of the
linotype and electric motor.
Electricity and gas are used In light
ing the city. The electric power is gen
erated at the Truckee River and reaches
Carson via Reno and Virginia City. In
many instances it is used as a power
as well as for lighting- purposes.
A new echoolhouse will be erected
this summer. $25,000 having been set
aside for that purpose. It will be built
of stone and much larger and finer than
The present building. The spiritual wel
fare of the Carson itas is being well
looked after by very able ministers of
four denominations: Episcopalian, Pres
byterian. Methodist and Catholic. Each
church is prosperous anQ much good
\u25a0work is' accomplished by them individ
ually and collectively.
The water Supply is from the natural
springs of the Western Mountains. It
is stored in large reservoirs and piped
to the consumers. Purer, Better water
cannot be found, making Carson a par
ticularly healthy city. Artesian water
is also used, as good flowing wells may
be bored In any portion of the valley.
The Government has had this water
tested and pronounced it chemically
pure.
Near by is the United States Mint,
long since dismantled of its money
msking machinery. It is built of
tftone In a handsome square design and
is now used as an assay and bullion of
lice..' jr
The Federal or Government building,
one of the most imposing structures, is
built of brick. The United States Gov
ernment appropriated $100,000 for it,
and Carson has, as a result, a magnifl
<*ent piece of property, of which any
town might well be proud. It contains
the United States court, land offices
and the postoffice. It is surrounded by
well cared for lawns.
COVEa\ME.YT BUILDINGS.
Kast of the Capitol is the State Print
ing Office, made in the same style and
the offices of the Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction and the State Engineer
are also located in this building.
The Capitol building: is located near
the central portion of the town in a
square containing four blocks. The
grounds contain the band stand, in
which charming concerts are rendered
throughout the sumer by the Nevada
State Band, one of the finest on the
coast. The massive building- placed in
the center of the lot is of stone from
the prison, quarry and is at once sub
stantial and ornamental in its archi
tecture. It contains all the State of
fices. State Library and Supreme Court
room. The library, however, has out
grown its erstwhile ample quarters and
a new building has become necessary.
The recent legislature appropriated
$40,000 to meet this requirement and a
rstone structure .will be erected this
summer to be used as a. law library,
leaving the old library for the miscel
laneous books and reading-rooms. At
present there are something more than
â¢J O.OOO volumes in the library, 15,000 of
which are law books.
The city of Carson has been beauti
fied in keeping with its surroundings
and Is considered one of the finest
towns on the coast from an. artistic
point of view. It is the pride of its in
habitants to have the town excel Its
neighbors in attractiveness, and the re
rnlt is most gratifying. The number of
irult and shade trees, together with
lawns and flowers growing about each
residence, makes thÂ« ensemble perfect-
While the four distinct seasons are
recurring excessive heat end cold are
unknown. Sunstroke never, prostrates
man or beast at their labors. Health is
inevitably the rule under such climatic
conditions, consumption or malaria
never originating in this part of Ne
vada. No dew or miasma arises at night
and the inhabitants almost live out of
doors during six months of the year. It
is an ideal climate for the agriculturist
or the invalid.
Carson City, the capital of Nevada, is
situated in Eagle Valley, most pictur
esquely surrounded by the Sierra Ne
vada Mountains. The southern peaks
are snow-capped at all seasons, rival
ing- in their rugged grandeur the world
fa.rned Alps, while the western slopes
are covered with majestic pines, man
zanita. And chaparral, with just enough
snow to intensify the deep, rich green.
This. valley is 4500 feet above sea
level, a mountain height, and owing to
the altitude and dryness of the atmos
1 here possesses a wonderful clearness.
Looking from Carson to the south,
the valley stretches to a mountain
range 'thirty-five miles away. Fifteen
miles to the northeast is the famous
Corasioek. and about the same distance
in an opposite direction is the most pic
turesque lake on the continent, Tahoe,
which is now ranked as one of the
p!easantcst resorts on the coast. The
Comstock is not dead by any means, for
Ophir is giving new ore bodies and
paying dividends. An Eastern company
is planning to drain the American Flat
and revive the" South End mines".

PRESIDENT
Of more direct service to the Stale
have been the large number of grad
uates and students who have settled
within her borders and have . directed
their efforts to the improvement of
the conditions about them, while the
schools of Agriculture, Mining and
Education have, in addition to the work
of Instruction, assisted by means of in
vestigation and conference to advance
the State's educational and technical
interests.
ACADEMIC IDEALS.
* Thus has the university been held
unswervingly to the plan conceived by
its first president. LeÃoy D. Brown, to
keep the university in close sympathy
with the - ideals of the State and in
faithful service to their needs. And
now when the State *!s once more
Etanding at the threshold of opportu
nity, the university, molded and'
strengthened during this period of
preparation, is ready to aid In mas
tering the problems before her. These
problems concern not. alone the ma
terial but the intellectual welfare of
the State. The revival of mining and
The graduates of the Schools of En
gineering are almost without excep
tion engaged In professional work
from San Francisco to New York
and from British Columbia to the
Isthmus, while In South Africa
they have gained a foothold in num
bers far out of proportion to the nu
merical importance of their State and
university and hold positions from the
more humble mfne surveyor and sam
pler of ores to resident manager of
some of the larger properties on the
Rand at salaries ranging from $10,000
Lo SIa.OOO per annum. Many of the
graduates also hold positions in the
Government service from the Geological
Survey to the position of second assist
ant examiner in the Division of Metal
lurgy and Electro-chemistry in the
Patent Office at Washington.
Of the graduates of the School of
Agriculture, one is engaged in dairy
ing, some have gone into mining; en
gineering, two arc engaged in business,
ope is teaching, and one has gained
distinction in war.
Others of our students have entered
the army from the Cadet Corps and
won commissions. .Â«
Of the graduates from the Schools of
Liberal Arts. General Science and Edu
cation, one Is the Representative of
Nevada in Congress, another is Su
preme Judge of the State, eight have
been elected to college professorships
in this and other States, while a larger
number have been college assistants
and instructors. One has been State
Superintendent of Public Instruction
and another has attained high rank
in the mining world. Still others are
editors and high school principals.
Many are engaged fn Government serv
ice and in the practice of N law. medi-'
cine and dentistry, while nearly one
half of the positions in the grammar
and ungraded schools of the State are
rilled by the graduates of the School of
Education.
The best evidence of the university's
success, however, is in its output of
successful graduates and students.
During its thirty years of existence
over 1400 students have been in at
tendance and 423 students have been
graduated from the college schools.
Since ISSI 228 baccalaureate degrees
have been conferred â a high percent
age of students and graduates consid
ering the population of Nevada and
the counties of California adjacent
thereto.
DISTINGUISHED ALI'MXL
Therefore, though transferred from
Elko to Reno in ISS7 and compelled to
etart anew, since that time the univer
sity has grown from two. preparatory
teachers to a faculty of twenty-eight
men and women, and from an unfin
ished building and lonely hilltop to a
campus of thirty-live acres and eleven
ouilciings â a plant valued at the present
time at J300.000. Its courses of in
struction also have been increased
from a high school course and a short
rourse in assaying to a fully developed
university having schools of Liberal
Arts, General Science, Engineering,
Agriculture, Domestic Arts and Educa
tion and a University High and Com
mercial school. The library' has grown
trom a shelf of books to 10.000 volumes
and a humble laboratory has given way
to a dozen laboratories devoted to prac
tically all the* better known sciences
both pure and technical. The dormitory
privileges have been improved from a
row of pine stalls over one of the reci
tation halls and the woodshop to the
commodious structures known as Man
tiinita and Lincoln halls, while the
struggle with nature to reclaim the
hilltop will finally end in a park to
which both students and citizens will
love to resort.
Much of this progress, too. has been
made since 1534 during the State's
greatest depression, for throughout this
trying period neither the regents nor
State Legislatures have ever failed to
respond to the increasing needs of the
university as it developed under the
masterful leadership of President
Stubbs.
One year ago the university passed
the thirtieth milestone of its existence
e.s the highest educational center of
Nevada and the seventeenth year of its
university career. Born in poverty but
rich in the faith of its founders, it. has
etrug'gled upward aga.ijist the declining
fortunes of the State and maintained
its supremacy among its sister institu
tions of the Great lia.sin and the region
to the north and the south.-
\u25a0 Closely allied to the university are
the Nevada Academy of j Sciences and
the State Historical Association, whose
one aim Is to perform for Nevada what
is being done by similar societies in
other "States. The. former has under
taken to determine the feasibility of re
foresting the denuded slopes of the
Sierras and to obtain high mountain
observations of temperature and pre
cipitation. The -lAtter has undertaken
the task of collecting materials for a
real history of Nevada before the last
of the pioneers - pass away, and the mass
of unwritten fact passes with. them. .- '-
Some features the university, will be
compelled to forego during, the imme
diate future.' such as schools of Law,
Medicine. .' Pharmacy and Dentistry.
In the schools . already founded, -how
ever, strong undergraduate courses are
being given and some > provision made
for graduate work. The most pressing,
need i 3 for more time and greater, re-J
source^ for . .original investigation
which will 'be of largo benefit to the
State on the one nand and will, give
the university and the faculty their
proper position In the, world of science
on the other.
In harmony with the spirit of serv
ice, the university has also established
a University High School, where stu
dents whose homes -are not situated
convenient to high schools may find
tue opportunity to continue their sec
ondary education as an end m itself
or as a preparation for college work in
the atmosphere of university life. .This
school, though a heavy burden on the
faculty, will be continued until increas
ing population makes possible the es
tablishment of Strong county high
schools in the more sparsely settled
counties of- the State.
THE HIGH SCHOOL.
the birth of agrriculture and manufac
tures have given rise to serious prob
lems in ore treatment, transportation
and power, the study of soils and soil
products, hydrographic measurements,
the protection of fruits, the care of the
ranges, the breeding of cattle and the
problems of construction, j ...
The technical problems of mining. !
mechanical and civil engineering .and
the plans of the university to meet them .
are discussed under separate titles by
the university leaders in these branches. i
The School of Agriculture and the
Experiment Station have long been lay
ing the foundation of scientific agricul
ture, stock raising, dairying -and fruit
growing by patient investigation and
formal conferences throughout . the
State with ranchers and stockmen. At
the present time the inauguration, of
the new irrigation law is being assisted
by the taking of hydrographic .meas
urements In collaboration with the
State Engineer. ; . '/ f'i'A'-'Jr.^Ti \u25a0
EXTELVSIOX WORK.
This earnest endeavor to advance the
material interests of the State is bal
anced by a similar earnestness on the
part of the Schools of; Liberal Arts and
General Science to advance and enrich
the intellectual life of the. people. To
this end, not only are courses invlan
"guage, literature, art, history, ethics,
sociology, economics -and; pure: science
given to the students at the university,
but a system of university - extension
lectures also has been - inaugurated
ilirough the generosity of. the railroads
of the State to bring the university to
the people. To these may be added the
special lectures on literature and' art
being given at Reno by distinguished
guests under the auspices of the Eng
lish Club, and the annual course of lec
tures in Christian ethics made possible
by the generosity of a university friend.
Of special interest to both citizens
and students will be the course of lec
tures on foreign " travel now being
planned by tne faculty as the central
feature of the weekly general assembly
during the coming college year. This
course is perhaps unique, but is well
adapted to the purpose, of the general
assembly, which is also. unique in being
the first college - assembly established
on the Pacific Coast to promote the gen
eral culture of the students. .
The School of Education is engaged
in creating a corps of resourceful and
ambitious teachers to be centers of in
fluence and intellectual life in the
sparsely settled c&nmunities, where all
advantages, except those of boundless
nature, are almost wholly denied.

7' Government officials report that tho
time .Is \u25a0 not distant for entry. . When
that : time arrives a big rush will , bo
made , to * secure available lands. Whllo
the \- agricultural .'\u25a0 ground is most deslr
able.l there is a vast army of prospectors
who want to be among the first to get
on the mineral bearing land. If one can
judge <by,: the ' chaVacter of ore that an
occasional Indian brings from that' sec
tion.vit is safe to assert that some of
the : richest mines in the State win \u25a0be
found ; on .Walker Lake Reservation after
Uncle Sam allows the miner, to rijatfuHy.
locate upon it. mBtitSBH
'The preliminary work to be done be
fore the land can be subject to entry
devolves upon the Geological . Survey,
of the Department of the Interior.
- The . engineering work for the con
structing of the gTeat Government
canal for the carrying of waters for
the : reclamation of the arid . lands, tho
greatest undertaking of the Western
country, also comes under the Jurisdic
tion -of - the Geological Survey. Thl3
work alone has Director Wolcott's de
partment taxed to its capacity. It fs
due to the great pressure of work upon
the Geological Survey that the reserva-i
tion lands have 'not been surveyed and
opeaed^for public entry.
. " A;,, supreme effort Is \u25a0 being made by the
Government officials to get to the task
of .surveyings these lands, ' which, \u25a0when
accomplished,^ will permit the General
Land "â¢ Commissioner at Washington to
designate the allotted lands and then
fix * a date for ' the opening, which * will
be ' published in advance throughout
the country. i^BMBBBBPnQH
; -At'; the: present time no. white man is
allowed on the reservation without a per
mit, , and ; in order to secure such hi 3
business must, be .-official. Prospectors
have occasionally slyly slipped into the
coveted i section. Upon . being discovered
by 'the Indian, police their outfits havo
been : confiscated and themselves escorted
off. the reservation. .
While the wards of Uncle Sam will
to a certain extent till the rich soil and
devote a certain portion of their existence
on this reservation to raising stock, they
have ' no propensity for scouring tho
mountainous sections in quest of mineral
bearing lodes.
For several years the public ha 3 clam*
ored for "the throwing open of the min
eralized ' xone â¢of this section. * The de
mands have been so urgent and repeated
upon the. Government that Congress dur
ing the fifty-seventh session passed a
bill which the President has since signed
and made i a law, authorizing the open
ing of the Walker Lake Reservation, to
Include all lands, however. The bill pro
vided that every Indian who was tho
heaa of a family on the reservation would
be given a certain number of acres of
agricultural land; that the reservation
must.be surveyed and Indian allotments
made' before the public would be allowed
to 'enter.
One section of Esmeralda County that
has large and rich mineral \u25a0 deposits and
very fertile lands for agricultural and
stockraising purposes has never been a
portion. of the public domain. It lies in
the northwest portion of the . county,
known as the Walker Lake Reservation.

ernment years ago for the use of the

V The State will also build more electric
street â¢ railways, \ for. the -available water
power is great. This again will offer a
new field. Then, too. the establishment
of new business plants I will give -fine op
-portunities' to the * civil engineer in con
struction work. The development of the
State means also good highways, more
bridges, good sewers and good water sup
plies. ', These questions are now being
much discussed by leading citizens and
some problems bearing on these subjects
; will have to be ' sttled . very soon. Here,
too, , the competent- consulting "engineer
will â¢ be , in/ urgent demand. ; m
The , temptation to the young men of
this State to go out and engage in actual
work in 'the field or in the mining camps
before completing . their .- education ' is
great; the- wages paid' in . the beginning
are large, but the promotion is not as
rapid as it would be bad they completed
their, college course. The old idea that
an engineer, can : learn by- experince all
that â¢is .essential " and that theory Is un
necessary, is gradually dying away. The
newer generation has found out that
theory coupled with will final
ly make the successful- engineer.
manently established. In the meantime
the. United States. Reclamation-. Service
will be continually looking for more
trained assistants. Many of these young
men are now being taken from the grad
uates of the * schools of mining ; and me
chanical engineering of , this university
and \u25a0 from ' the 'department . of . civil engi
neering of the. University of California.
While the Nevada men are doing very,
creditable .work, they . would '- have been
much better, prepared had - they gradu
ated as students in 'civil engineering. But
until quite "recently, there was little de
mand-for. civil engineers. Since then,
however, thÂ« * demand ; has increased so
rapidly that the university has estab

regular courses, which although still very
young promises to compare favorably
with such departments in other universi
ties., . .:\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'
Besides the United States Reclamation

State develops and will cause an increas
ing demand ' for professionally trained
men.
It will be a form of university exten
sion work and under the direction of
the School of Mechanical Engineering
of the university. It is hoped that the
establishment of this railroad school,
besides being of benefit to the rail
road men. will also prove valuable to
those students who care to deovte
themselves to railroad work, by giving
them, the opportunity of coming into
close contact with practical men and
the practical side of the motive power
department of a great railroad.
in view and to meet local conditions
the course of study .'was made to differ
from similar courses in Eastern-- States.
For example, the student in this school
is required to take all the surveying
offered by the School of Civil Engineer
ing. He is also well grounded In the
fundamental elements of electrical en
gineering:.
In the purely mechanical engineering:
his time is devoted to the study of ma
chine design, the mechanical engineer
ing of power plants, power generation
and transmission, the theory of heat
and heat engines, including gas, gaso
line, dil. steam and hot air engines,
steam turbines, steam boilers, water
wheels' and turbines, pumping machin
ery, including centrifugal and turbine
pumps, air compressors, compressed air
and its applications, appliances for the
handling and transporting of materials,
and to a fair amount of experimental
engineering. '
The establishment of the railroad
*Â£hops at Sparks will also affect tho
school. The Southern Paciflc authori
ties have authorized the erection of a
building to be fitted with drawing jand
lecture rooms. Here the employes will
be given , instruction in mechanical
drawing/machine design and such tech
nical subjects as pertain directly to
their work.

SINCE the discovery of Tonopah In
the summer of 1900, the progress of
the camp has been gradual, but
In every respect highly satisfactory,
and its condition to-day warrants the
prediction that it will ere long take
rank as the greatest gold aad silver
mining camp in America. The critic
â¢who refers to the age of the camp and
asks why a greater number of mines
are not paying: dividends must remem
ber that Tosopah more than any other
new discoveries of recent years labored
under grreet disadvantages vrhich took
tjme. perseverance and capital to over
come. These disadvantages may be
enumerated zs follows:
Firstly â Tho deep rooted prejudice
against Nevada, which, since the de
cline of the Comstook. has staggered
under the (Saniased reputation of a sil
ver State, whose once great and only
mining camp was exhausted.
Secondly â Tte lack of water and fuel
and the cocsequesi difficulty in the
profitable mining of its ores, added to
tfcis the fact that it was separated by
e:xty raOes of desert fron ihe nearest
railway point, making it necessary that
payable shipping: ore should be of the
ininiraum valuo of (ICO per ton.

is one. full claim owned by. the Tonopah
Extension. MM' and Mining , Company,
but more popularly known as the West
Knd, having a capitalization of 000,000
Â«harÂ«sr"pf/sl*each, of which 300,000
were reserved for treasury. The main
shaft has -been 'sunk to a depth of 780
feet,\; passing 1 through a' big body of
low grade ore. "
THE WEST END.
The company l.n capitalized for 1.000,
000 shares of ?! each,' of which 400,000
were placed in the treasury. . The mine
was closed down In April last, no rea
son being given by the directors.
'^Four .veins have been opened' up that
carry milllns: values with bunches . and
streaks of shipping ore. One carload (15
tons of . ore was shipped" In July last,
which is said to have netted about $206
per ton. : '
On. the eastern extension- of the Mon
tana Tonopah'a vein system is the prop
erty of the North Star Mining Company,
comprising: . .five claims /and a tunnel
site. , A main" shaft on the western slope
of Mount Oddle v has been sunk to a
depth of 1060 feet,- and. about 3000 feet
oÂ£;c,rosscutting and drifting has been
done, the west drift connecting with
the east drift of the Montana mine on
the 512 foot level. " . â¢
To more rapidly develop the . niine.. a
new seventy, horsepower hoisting en
gine has been ordered with cages, cars
and also, a Gates ore crusher by which
the output of the mine will be greatly
increased. From the present great
showing: in the mine It is easy to pre
dict for it a wonderful future. Fur
ther exploration will undoubtedly open
vp In Its territory the great "Macdori
ald" . and "A. B. K." reins, on their
western course from the Montana mine,
while the _ unkonwn possibilities of its
great extent of virgin 1 ground can not
be estimated. "
THE NORTH STAR PROPERTY.
At the point where It was struck in
the . Midway it was eleven feet wide,
and for the whole width showed some
of the most wonderful specimen ore'
opened up in Tonopah. It has now been
drifted on for 100. feet wesU and 150
feet east and still maintains Its great
values, varyingr in width from four to
twelve 'feet, ail shipping grade, and Is.
beJner further, explored by winzes and
raises. In the course of this develop
ment .work, aince the twenty-fifth of
February. 725^ tons of, ore have been
shipped, but the returns f0r "559 -tons
only have been received and netted tne
company $79,847 69; an' average of
1142 84 per ton.
There are. now 2500 tons of ore on
the. dump, of. an average value of $40
per ton, while the ore blocked out in
the mine is estimated at 54.250.000.
Adjoining the Montana Company's
claims on the west and covering the ex
tension .of â¢ its known veins and those
yet undiscovered, Is the. property of the
Tonopah . Midway Mining Company,
which has but recently come Into great
prominence by reason of having opened
up another of Toriopah's phenomenally
rich ore bodies. The company owns
five claims and has a capitalization of
1,000,000 shares of $1 each, of which
250,000 were placed In the treasury.
The main shaft has reached a depth
of 545 ' feet . and with crosscuts and
drifts the total amount. of underground
work amounts to over 4500 feet. One
vein was cut in the shaft at a depth
of 450 feet, and three other veins In
crosscuts to the north. All these veins
carried ore of payable milling grade
and, in places, streaks of high grade
shipping ore. It was not, however, un
til the end of February of this year
that the north crosscut entered what
is now known to be the western ex
tension of the south vein in the Mon
tana mine and one of the richest pro
ducing veins of that mine.
all mines is whether the veins go down
and granted that one man can see far
ther into the ground than another,
there Is nq doubt that theee ores are
of primary origin and should therefore
continue to great depth.

which imperceptibly enthralls the resi

Here in a sandy reach of the San An

lands the traveler in the town of Tono

mountains now being divested of their
buried wealth. For a few miles he has
seen the smoke stacks and the head

rrorn tho solitude and quiet of tho
desert to the busy depot is startling.
The freight yards are piled tip With all
kinds of Commodities from groceries to
furniture and mining machinery.
Here are vast piles of hay, lumber

loaded with ore for the smelters. Im
mense wagons with wheels six feet
high and eisht inches wide, two and
three hitched together in. a. line, and
drawn by from twelve to twenty-two

MIDWAY EXTENSION COMPANY.
] Adjoining the Midway mine on the west
are two patented claims and one fraction
owned by the Golden Anchor Mining Com
pany. The shaft* on this property reached
a depth of 750 fqet. and a crosscut north
from this level nas recenyy cut a vein
over twenty feet wide of ; milling value,
but which in places assayed as high as
$17U and $200 i?er ton. This vein is now
being opened up and the main shaft la
also beicg sunk, to the 900-foot level,
from which, point another crosscut will
be run to the vein.
Adjoining the Tonopah Extension mine
on the' south are three patented claims
owned by. ' the Red Rock Consolidated
Mining Company, where, the main shaft
is now down 26J feet. A 60. horsepower
steam hoist has. recently been installed at
the mine and the shaft win -be pushed
to the SUO level before crbs3cutting. This
ground had most encouraging surface
values and some valuable veins wtil un
doubtedly be opened up at depth.
, The western extension of. this ground
Is owned by the MctCane M'l'ilTig Com
pany of Tonopah," having ten patented
claims, which are so j located " that they
give a length of 4500 feet on the course
of the two veins in the Tonopah Exten
sion mine. The main shaft of this prop
erty is located 5250 feet west of the Ton
opah Extension shaft, and has now
reached a depth of 1060 feet, tut has not
yet lettered the lode- porphyry. This is
a mo*t remarkable Instance of "blind
sinking." uiere being no Indications of
mineral on the surface. It is probable
that. crosscutting for the vein will com
mence, at the 1100- foot level.
The mine Is splendidly eauipped with
a powerful hoisting plant, a twelve drill
compressor plant and a Gates ore crusher
with a capacity of 100 tons * â¢ per day.
This mine U remarkable for the fact that
for the full 850 feet for which vela No.

the ; most perfectly denned vein In the
camp, and show* no evidence of faulting.
On the 4Co : foot level of this vein' or* U
now being' mined from a stops 14 feet
wide, every pound of .wnxch Is shipping
grade. As this property covers 3000 feet
on the course of these two glgantlo veins
it may Justly be described as the great
est mine In Tonopah to-day. On May 25
the. company declared a dividend of S
cents per share, payable July t,
jickane mining coatPAirr.
'Where crosscut on the 500-foot level it la
IS feet wide and will average clear across
from $40 to $IQQ per ton. At the 400-foot
level a paralle" vein was found which
has been proved to be : 86 feet wide, of
milling grade. Both of these veins carry
high grade shipping ore, and have also
produced specimen ore of great value. The
total amount of underground work in
this mine, amounts. to about- 4000. feet, ex
posing ore of the estimated value of $12,
230,000, and there are also over 5000 tons
of ore on the dump assaying $30 per ton.
On October 29 the . mine commenced
shipments and from that date to April
29, six months, 4255 tons have been ship
ped, the present output . being from 2SO
to SOO tons per week. The management
of this company are not yet at liberty to
give the exact returns for. the total
amount of ore shipped, which is graded
to an average, value, although some con
siderable quantity of very high grade ore
has bten marketed. As an Instance of this
It may bÂ« stated that one car load shipped
the first week of this month realized over
$900 per ton net.
This was the first property purchased
by Mr. McKane and work was com
menced In May, 1303. a shaft being start
ed on what was thought to he the course
of the Mizpah vein, which happily proved
correct. At a depth of 220 feet the shaft
entered a vain in which it continued for
50 feet, dipping out of the shaft at about
270 feet. This vein, known as No. 1. has
been explored* to a depth of 500 feet and
opened ud on Its western course for 500
feet on the 400-foot level, while the easJL
ern drift is now within a few feet of the
Tonopah Mining Company's boundary,
having proved that It is the extension of
Mizpah vein, and the sinking of the mala
shaft has now been resumed.
All these properties are situated on
the western course of the Tonopah vein
system, and have a total extreme length
north and sputh across the vein system
of. 12,000 feet or nearly one and a half
miles, and a continuous lensth on the
course of the Mizpah vein system of 8400
feet or over one and a half miles through

on account of its location, but also as
a wealth producer. Two full claims, the
Jumbo and Clermont, and two fractions,
the Grizzly Bear and Lucky- Boy, con

The great strikes . were made j upon the
Jumbo claim.. some' eighteen -months
ago. The production from .this : single
claim is astonishing, and' large:- bodies
of high' grade ore still ; remain to jbe
mined.- The" : Bows-Kernick lease,
which was . the heaviest -producer, | has

Adams, Jefferson and Monroe," offers
an example of the intelligent and, con
servative development characteristic
of this district- These claims were lo
cated by the president of the company,
R. L. Johns, who is also a prominent
attorney. Mr. Johns is the president of
the Goldfield Mining Company and the
locator of the famous January mine.
Since June. 1904, the Adams-Goldfield
Company has been constantly engaged
In developing work. Thus far no ore
has been shipped, although some ore
assaying as high as $100 a ton has been
extracted. The ledge at the bottom of
the location shaft averages 515 a ton.
On the Monroe claim a ledge was dis-~
covered averaging $46 a ton. All tho
stock of the original owners of tho
claim has been pooled and the com
pany is not selling any treasury stock ,
at present, as it has sufficient money,
for development purposes.
The Goldfleld Mining Company, -which
was incorporated in January, 1304, owns
three groups of claims, all of â¢which,
have been leased during the past year.
The January mine produced during tho
last year $200,000 worth of shipping ore
and $300,000 worth, of milling ore. All
the ore was extracted from, a portion of
the ledge 150 feet in length and 106 feet
in depth, and much valuable ruffling
ore was left in the stopes.
Both the above companies are Incor
porated-. under the laws of Arizona
with a capitalization of one million
shares of stock of a par value of one
dollar per share. The officers do not
receive any salary. The same officers
serve both companies. They are: Presi

TONOPAH WATER COMPANY.
TTtttil the advent of Colonel E. O
-Wheeler and J. B. Quisle/ of San Fran
cisco with George D. Mahooaey of Oak
land, no one had realized the commer
cial value of the snow-dad hills to thÂ«
north of Tonopah. They did, hownHÃi.
and the Tonopah -Water Company, wttix
a capital of $1,000,000, was the immedlata
result.
The company now owns 10,000 acres of
watershed supplied from thesa' nma
mountains. It has ten wells, each from
50 to 140 feet deep, and a pumping plant
situated sixteen miles north of Tomopah
In the heart of the desert. . The water
is cool, pure, and so plentiful that a
weed's trial pumping reduced tho volume
not on* inch. ;
Tins has all been accomplished staee
last August and yet so quickly has the
population grown that the- city, supply
is now far from adequate. Often water
gives - out altogether and long, since tha
housekeepers of Tonopah learned to
make washday and bathday coincide from
sheer necessity. But the water company
is â¢, even - now constructing a new reser

BL'LLFIIOO MIA'OTG DISTRICT.
Some eighty miles northeast of Gold
field there is a mineral belt that i 3 very
attractive, not only to the prospector,
but also to the mining Investor. This
district is designated by the name of
Bullfrog. - which \u25a0 first came into promi
nence . some \u25a0 eight months ago, due to
the phenomenal find on the Original
Bullfrog of high grade ore. This dis
covery , was made by . Use Harris,
known as Shorty Harris, a poor pros
pector,, who was headed for Goldfield.
He noticed a well-defined dike and
after a careful search found rock con
taining I gold, a Sending Cross, another
prospector and his partner/ to Goldfield
with" samples to be assayed, Harris be
gan.to open up the ledge.
upon arriving in Goldfield, se
cured ;iid from townspeople, as the as
says ran up into the hundreds, some as
hig-h as $15,000 per. ton. It cost toe
original' investors 'just 9500. This is tne
authentic story, of the discovery of the
Original Bullfrog, which has proven to
be one of the richest properties in Ne
vada. Work ; is being pushed on these
claims, more than thirty men being em
ployed, and. there is an immense ledge
of quartz/ fully 2000 f eet * in length,
which outcrops on the surface. A cross
cut, has -been run in a distance of 200
feet, as well as. a drift more than fifty
feet in length, and the crosscut, as well
as various shafts, - all more than' sixty
feet deep, show good ore bodies,' which
assay from 5120 to $1500 per ton. This
company recently shipped five' tons of
ore. as a test for gold and silver values,

MOORE
TELLS
STORY
Thirdâ The ore bodies in these veins
are .short, but numerous and exceed
ingly rich. The only region |in the
United States comparable with this in
average value of the ore is Cripple
Creek, Cojo., but the first year of Gold
field's existence, in which reliable esti
mates show a production of $2,000,000
in smelting ore and J3.000.000 in milling
ore (smelting ore being reckoned as
that above $100 per ton in gold value
and the milling ore all that below this
grade), is immensely beyond that of
Cripple Creek, which shows . only $200,
000 production for its first year. It is
only fair to state, however, that Crip
ple Creek had much unfavorable public
opinion to overcome in its carry his
tory, while the public was somewhat
prepared for Goldfleld through the ex
traordinary results of developments in
Tonopah for two years previously, this
district being only twenty-three miles
north of Goldfield. . , .
Fourthâ While the ore is disseminat
ed ! through numerous cracks, - cross-:
slips arid fissures in the uppermost or
oxidized portions of the ' veins. ; and is
thus difficult to follow systematically,
yet at . a depth of 140 feet, * where the
oxidized zone ends and the live ore Is
found, the - veins become much better.
defined and regular with one -if x not
both walls clearly apparent and the
values in the live or sulphide ore zone
are nearly as â¢ great as " the . average of
the oxidized , zone above. .; ; -
Fifth â The character of the change tn
the ore as the sulphide zone Is explored
deeper is favorable to continuity of
values downward. Copper bearing min
erals appear in' the. vein together ' with
one or two other base - -netals such as
antimony \u25a0\u25a0 and zinc, ana these all indi
cate permanency of value, in- greater
depths, especially where there is no in
crease \u25a0in - silver values over the small
amounts' in the â¢surface 'ores. While
these other metals In the sulphide zone
of course remove the free milling char
acter of the ores, . yet the high ..values
still continuing fully. Justifies the more
expensive plant . necessary ' for. bene
flciating these values, and, there Is al
ways - a permanent market \u25a0 for 'these
smelting ores In San Francisco < and
Salt Lake City. '
Sixthâ The transportation . and'mill
ing facilities will soon . be', increased.
The first railroad, broad gauge, will
reach the town and be 'open for traffic
in the coming September. I -At present,
the nearest depot : is ;at â¢\u25a0 Tonopah^
twenty-eight miles â¢ distant by Vwagon

Second â The veins are numerous,
deep-seated and defined as well as
some other rich gold- producing re
gions. They are not so well defined as
some of the noted gold . regions "of
much lower average ore values, c. g.,
those along the mother lode in Cali
fornia, the Bohemia district in Ore
gon, Gilpin and Clear Creek counties,
Colorado, etc., but are more nearly
analogous to some of the veins in Crip
ple Creek. Colo., Kalgoorlie, West
Australia, and others in which the
main ore channel is very narrow and
must be watched closely during under
ground development and in which the
values are mainly disseminated in a
number -of narrow . parallel j cracks,
seams and laminations 'rather, than in
one large central well defined single
crevice. , .
First â The.- region so far explored,
but only partly so, includes fifty-six
square " miles of. mineralized territory,
of which only one-fourth has been'de
veloped sufficiently to open payable
mines, but the shallow explorations
and surface indications in the remain
ing three-fourths all point .\u25a0; to many
more mines yet to be discovered there
in, also to the fact that the extent of
the region will be much greater than
at present, when further prospecting
and judicious exploration is carried
forward.
The questions as to whether the de
posits show evidence of secondary as
well as primary mineralization, wheth
er the adjacent country rock originally
contained minerals from which the so
lutions obtained their values through
leaching, whether the silicifled ledges
are properly classified as dikes, or
should be designated by some other
technical term, cannot be discussed
in an article of this nature, which is
intended solely for the average news
paper reader. The main questions are
whether the Goldfield district presents
good evidence of permanency as a min
ing region, whether the high values in
the veins are merely "superficial or
whether they can be expected at great
er depths than any thus far attained
(300 feet from the surface is. the-maxi
mum as yet), arid whether the veins
themselves are merely superficial
cracks In the nature of gashes, or
whether they are true fissures of con
siderable extent both horizontally and
downward. If. the evidence shows that
the answers to these questions are all
favorable, then the Goldfield district
must take, its place -among the best
gold producing regions in the ' United
States and rank high among all those,
known in the world to-day.
Xhe conclusions reached by the writer
are as follows: .
of the surrounding Tocks decreased, the
solutions began cooling and depositing
their various minerals, the most ex
tensive being quartz, which thus silici
fied the sides or walls of the fissures,
cracks and crevices through which the
waters circulated and in which the
veins are deposited.
ments;' It supplies the recent lack of
such in the Sierra Nevada region, and
when it is known that all modern
methods of transportation, are in vogue,
including automobiles and -traction
engines, and .that water is obtainable
from numerous wells within the town
and springs -a few miles distant and at
a depth of 150 feet in the mines, it will
be understood that the difficulty of
working in a. treeless country, a so
called desert, is greatly mitigated, and
that the" advent of the railroad will
lessen considerably the cost of all sup
plies, especially of timber, that neces
sity in all deep. mining. ' "'.": â¢ ..
, Electric light and power [companies
are' constructing their lines rapidly and
bringing in power for all purposes from
points eighty miles distant in Cali
fornia where the power is generated." \
The initial price of* properties" is not
excessive,'- but as before stated these
are ' rapidly being purchased from, the
original locators, and with energetic
well directed mine development this
will speedily rise to the highest I rank
among: the richest gold mining districts
in the United States. - .

The board of directors of the Bull

have Just made the following report to
| stockholders:
j Yonr company owns the Bullfrog
townsite. which embraces one hundred
and sixty acres of land Immediately
south of and adjoining the main mines
of the Bullfrog: mining district, Nye
County, State of Nevada; the Goss
Springs and water rights situated about
two miles south of the Amargosa River
and about ten miles from your town

a pipe line between the springs and the
town of Bullfrog; eleven and seven
eights miles of nine, seven and six Inch
i Pteel riveted pipe, and a three-story
frame hotel on lots nine and ten in
block forty-four.
The town has now a population of
about nine hundred people, with a daily
increase in population of thirty. There
is located In your town the poÂ«toffice oi
the district, the District Recorder's of
nce for the district, the Southern Ne
vada Banking: Company, with a capitat
of $250,000, the central office of the
Bullfrog-Goldileld and Las Vegras Tele
phone and Telegraph Company, and one
of the finest hotels in Southern Nevada,
the Justice of tho Peace for the town
ship and the county jail for Southern
Nye County. In' addition to this the
main mercantile houses in Southern- Ne
vada are also located in your town.
Hon. W. M. Stewart, for thirty years in
the United States Senate from the State

all the events of' the ramous Comstock,
has selected Bullfrog as his future
home. He Is associated with. Key Pitt

In establishing your new townsite it
was' considered best to give to the own
ers of lots in the old towns of Amar
gosa and Bonanza the same numbered
lots and In the same blocks in the town
of Bullfrog as they occupied In the old
townsites. "While this consumed a num
ber of good lots, it gave you the moral

BULLFROG, May 22.â R. Macbeth, gen-
Ctal manager of the Lucky Boy mines of
Custer, Idaho, out of which $11,000,000 has
been extracted; has spent a week investi
gating the leading properties of the Bull
frog district. He Is In the field represent
ing Salt Lake capital." Upon being inter
viewed about the district, he said: v
"Through " the courtesy of Mr. Mont
gomery and ; his : capable i superintendent,
Mr. Hoveek > I. was permitted to make an
examination of the Montgomery-Shoshone
mine. I found the ledge eighty feet thick,
the strike to be northeast and southwest,
and -dip about fif ty-flve degrees to the
southeast. It is a contact between birds
eye porphyry arid" rhybHte,' 1 the porphyry
forming ' the fodtwall. and.lt cannot pos
sibly .miss the â¢ Montgomery Mountain
Mining Company's ground. "
I "Of the eighty feet of ore ;, eleven feet
are talc, which should run from $300Â«*o
$500 from the pannings J made, and sixty
nine feet are mixed talc, auartz and
porphyry.jWhich should run from $50 to
$100. Fifty/ feet have: been^ drifted In the
tajc on i the ' footwall," an upraise forty
six feet to the surface, and a winze twen
ty-twofeet deep sunk on the talc. By
giving fifteen cubic feet to the ton, as
the ore is light in weight, there ace easily
in sight at the present time 80,000 tons of
ore and $5000 has not yet been spent In
development work. This, from the values
contained, makes . the . Montgomery-Sho
shone, even with the present showing,
one of the greatest mines in the world.
"I went over. Montgomery Mountain and
made a careful examination of it.'. I found
it : to consist of a series of parallel por
phyry and rhyolite dikes^ making nuraer-.
ous contacts, in each of which ore should
be found. These dikes 6trike northeast

the supply of water furnished by them
is more than sufficient for present use.
These two springs arc -now flowing
500,000 . gallons of , water daily. The

The main mineral belt seems to cover
an area of ten square miles. The led^e*
seem to be much more defined and give
better Indications of -permanency than
tho3a In the Goldfleld district. In fact,
there seems to have been less volcanic
action., consequently the overburden of
lava flow is not so pronounced as In tno
Goldfleld district. The ledges in most
of the properties have & general trend;
the main lead seems to dip easterly and
westerly, but.- however. Is cut now and

Coming 1 to Nevada with the late "W.
"W. Morris In 1903 and again tn Jane,
1904, for the purpose of examining the
Reveille and the Montana- Tonopah. it
was upon his recommendation that '
these splendid . properties were devel
oped. Impressed with what ne found
here, Mr. Macdonald returned to Mon
tana for the purpose of so adjusting
his affairs that he could leave them.
He located permanently in Tonopaa la,
August, 1904. His professional career'
since that time has been marked by
success after success. Utilizing the
ripened, knowledge gained In bis litigi
ous. Butte experience, he Is known and
blessed as the discoverer of the rich
est and most productive body of ore
in this camp. In his honor they have
christened it the "Macdonald'* ledge,
and some of the principal mines of the
camp figure on paying dividends from
it, for years to come. While the vein
might or might not have been dis
covered later, it was under, bis insist
ent direction that the work was prose
cuted which uncovered It. In the vari
ous . companies with, which he Is con
nected his advice is followed implicit
ly and seemingly . with, astonishingly
uniform success. The people of this
section swear by him. Many call ft*â¢
lucky, but back of it all Is the fact
that he is an indefatigable worker* up
early in the morning, : a burner of the
midnight oil, ' possessed of wonderful
executive ability and a shrewd, Scotch
common sense which gets to the meat
of things and Impels him to do things.
In addition to his work as advisor to
many of the large corporations of this
district. Mr. Macdonald Is Interested in
many private enterprises, being prob
ably one of ," the â¢ heaviest Investors In
Southern Nevada.

the south to the old Comstock claims
on the north, Malcolm L. Macdonald.
M. E., was found to be an extremely
busy man. While much of the data
relative to the wonderful resources of
this part of Nevada have been obtained
from Mr. Macdonald, all efforts to ob
tain anything of a personal nature
from the gentleman himself met with
scant success. The Call Is indebted to
the old-time friends of this pre-eminent
engineerâ for he is so proclaimed by
the mining men of. this sectionâ for
the notes which follow relative to the
career of the young man who. probably
more than any other, has demonstrated
to investing capitalists the value and
permanency of Southern Nevada mines.
Briefly, he was born in Nevada with
in sight of historic Mount Davidson,
receiving his education in California.
In ISBB he" located in Butte, Mont., be
coming associated with the old firm of
Baker & Harper and afterward suc
ceeding Mr. 'Baker as a member of the
firm. 'This firm during Mr. Macdonald's
connection 1 , with it had charge of the
construction of the celebrated Big Hole

The Bullfrog District, situated sixty
miles south of Goldfleld, was discov
ered In the fall of 1904 and is being ex
tensively and rapidly developed. The
ledges discovered thus far have been
of enormous size and in many instances
of fabulous richness. A recent strike,
known as the Shoshone Mountain strike,
shows a vein fifty feet wide, which shows
an avenge of about J2?O per ton. Assays
ranging from ?S0 per ton to $1600. The
values in this district are principally in
pold, although in some portions of the
district high values in silver are obtained.
Prospectors are examining and locating
in the Funeral Range, in the Grapevine
Range and in the Crested Butte Range,
and it is probable that new districts will
be discovered in these sections;- Through
out the greater portion of this country
there is a scarcity of water; In some dis
tricts it is the most 6erious problem to
be contended with. Fortunately in the
Tonopah District this has been overcome
by bringing in a pipe line some fourteen
miles; in the Goldfleld District water is
obtained in quantty at the Alkali Springs
and pumped into the district the distance
of about twelve miles. Some water is
being found in the Diamondfield District,
which will materially benefit the Goldfleld
section. At Silver Peak there Is an abun
dance of water of good quality. At Lida
Valley there is ample water for all pres
ent purposes pumped from the mines. At
Bullfrog the water is In the Amargosa
River In considerable quantity at from
four to seven miles distent from the prin
cipal mines. In the Kawlch District thus
far but little water has been found, al
though water can be brought Into the
district by piping come twenty odd miles.
In addition to the districts mentioned,
other districts In the . neighborhood
â¢which are receiving attention and In
â¢which valuable finds of ore have been
xna.de are the Lone Mountain District,
ten miles west of Tonopah (In which Is
eltuated the Nevada-Alpine property,
which produced $150,000 during its first
year's operation and has now a very val
uable body of ore In sight. The ores in
Lone Mountain District are mostly silver
and lead, many of the properties showing
very high values in silver) ;the Ray Dis
trict, eltuated eight miles north of Tono
pah; the Liberty District, thirty miles
north of Tonopah; the Reveille District.
Elxty miles east cf Tonopab (where enor
mous developments of sliver lead ore
have recently been made, one property
stated to have SlOjOdO.ooo in eight); the
Eton* Cabin District; the Cactus Springs
District, situated forty miles southeast of
Tonopah; the Gold Mountain District,
twelve miles south of Tonopah; the Klon
dike District, sixteen miles south of Tono
pah; the Gold Crater
district, twenty miles â¢*"
southeast of Goldfield;
the Sylvania district,
twenty-flve miles
southwest of Silver
Peak; the Tule Canyon
district, twenty-flve
miles southwest of
Lids, Valley district! In
all these districts ac
tive prospecting and
development is in pro
gress and prospectors
are spreading from all
these districts into
other adjacent sections
where .it is reasonable
to presume other finds
of ore will be made. In
the districts mentioned:,
covering an area of
about 100 miles In
length t (north and
south) by 100 miles in
breadth (east and
west) in the year IDOo
there was a population
of less than 100 people.
At the present time
there are about 15,000
and with the valuable
discoveries which are
being made' lt is reas
onable to presume that
this population will be
doubled within the next
two years. The ores
from this section, gen
erally speaking, are
high grades .of .ores,
â¢compared \u25a0 with â¢what
are being 1 treated . In :
other districts on the
Pacific Coast, and with,
the completed and
promised' railroad fa- j
duties and the advent
of electrical ; rower
(two companies are
bringing in power) and
the . constant Increase -

fact.--" . : -.. -' . - /*,. .-â¢ .; ..." .- \u25a0:.
While it'may not be correct; to say
that the ledges iot% this property^ are
the same ledges that crop , on the prop
erty of the Goldreed, Mines Company, as
a small gulch v >.intervenes> between them,
yet; by* reason* .'of strike Of these
veins and the; similarity- of the ore, >it
is .very probable J they . are - the - same.
The ore,.as is" characteristic of the'dis
trict, is a \u25a0 yrhlte , quartz, tinted with; a
pink color, carrying ; a great, dear of
oxidized iron. , "The values; are almost
entirely in gold, which /is found free,
or in other j words, in \u25a0 its native state.
The ledges, vary in width from three to
ten feet, and'the ore' isdlstinctly sep
arated-from the walls by. talc seams.
Assays taken from various places on
the cropplngs give returns ,from $10 to
$67 in gold. These values, of course, at'
the present time \ are not sufficient to
warrant the shipment of the ores, but
there will undoubtedly be encountered
rich shoots, : as is customary in' such
character of ledges in Southern Nevada,
particularly in the.Goldneld mining dis
trict. The greatvalues will be obtain

This period is not ata far. distant date,

Malcolm :' Macdohald ;- which ;: is published
in this issue of The Call."
Probably', second in importance as a
mining property iu^ the Goldreed mining'
district, State of . Nevada/ is the prop
erty of the- 'Kawlch Goldreed, Mmmg 1
Company.- This Company's property
consists of five mining: claims lying im
mediately north of , and on the same
ledges that intersect the property of
the Goldreed Mines Company. By rea
son of the lack of .water that has here
tofore existed \ in. "that mining camp lit
tle development work, has. been done on
this property. However, there are sev
eral strons veins ''Of gold-bearing ore
crossing' the entire property.
S. A. KNAPPoperated, -he beautiful blue gems found
In this vicinity are highly prized by tha
manufacturing jewelers of the great
cities. The full extent of the wealth of
the, Lida jewel deposits has never been
ascertained. The gold \u25a0 mines of tho
section have un to date produced over
$6,000,000 in bullion. The Death Valley
mine. alone has produced $300,000. As to
the future of Lida, It la not difficult to
prophesy. With the influx of capital and
the constant improvements in mining
methods, it would seem that prosperous
days were in store for this favored
locality. . .
In addition to the mining of precious

Lida. is probably the pleasantest to live
in. The climate' is similar to that of
California and the elevation. 6200 feet. 13
a guarantee of healthful conditions. The
town ia , surrounded by massive moun
tains, through which passes run from the
south, east and north. The , mountain
sides are well timbere.il with a growth
of pine and spruce. Little farms dot the
hillsides and delicious fruits are grown in
the neighborhood. The water supply ia
most abundant, both for mining and irri
gation purposes. About four miles to
the west of the town there 13 a fine flow
ing spring bubbling out of the mountain
fastnesses. The water of thl3 spring la
as cold and clear crystal.
A chemical analysis of this spring water
shows that it Is entirely free of any im
purities. The town may be said to owa
its existence to the discovery of this
spring by the Â«arly Spanish prospectors
many years ago. In estimating the valua
of tbls water supply, which at the pres
ent time Is undeveloped. It has been
fcund that it has. a natural flow exceed
ing one hundred and . twenty-five miner's
Inches. A water . company haa been
formed for the sole purpose of exploiting
this wonderful spring In the desert's
midst. This fountain of nature is al
ready being drained into a small reser
voir, which is being increased to meet
the demands of the town.
The basin Is 50 feet long by' 20 fset
wide and it is always full to tha brtra
â¢with cold spring: water. The company
is selling $50,000 worth of twenty-year
bonds at 7 per cent and has contracted
with the townslte company to lay tho
mains and supply the town with tho
necessary water. The elevation of this
water supply insures the noit perfect
tire protection, the gravity bein? great
enough to enable the town to dispensa
with a pumping station.
There is every prospect / that In tha
near future Lida will be connected with
the outside world by both steam and
electric roads. A railroad Hne is being
surveyed between Alvord. California and
Lida, a alstance of forty-two miles. With
the completion of thiÂ» railroad there will
be" complete facilities for the shipment
of ore direct from the mines now ia
operation, together with the smeltera
that are soon to be erected by the Wis
consin Mining and Smelting Company.
At " the present time automobiles run
rtgularly between Lida and Goldflald,
making- from two to four tripÂ» each flay.
Arrangements are being mada for con
structing an electric railway to Gold
fleia. and it )s likely that such a lln* will
be in operation before, the closo of an
other year.
The population of Lida is more than 1000
people and constantly Increasing. A
Chamber of Commerce was recently or
ganized by leading citizens. Tha t^ti
street lined with handsome frame build-*
Ings presents an Imposing appearance.-
Men. however, with funds to spare are
not sitting idly waiting for the railroad.
They are getting In ahead of it. Only
the other day the old and still wonder
fully rich Wisconsin was sold for $300,000
cash to a new company, composed of W.
R. Hale of San Francisco, August Stein
and Francis Burton, with other Eastern
and Western capitalists. - The new com-,
pany ., is capitalized for. $3,000,000 and has'
already ; begun work on its property,
whose eighteen \u25a0 claims practically cover
the whole Wisconsin Mountain. The
deepest shaft of the old days was 150
feet. This will be kept, ana another of
500; feet sunk from the- highest point. on
the mountain, at the contact of three dis
tinct veins. As soon as possible a smelt
er of _ a hundred tons capacity will be
put up. . Since the option was secured
a month ago, a vein sixty feet wide haa
been uncovered. This ore assays up to $1000
a "ton, and more than ten tons' have al
ready been sent . out ' under a strong
guard to the, smelters at Salt Lake. These
may only be the leavings of the past,
but they are substantial and extensive
leavings. For the mining district of Lida
alone extends ten .miles each way from
the town, and is only a part of the min
eral zone; running twenty miles wide and
forty long, through Nevada. \u0084

INVESTING CAPITAL.
.Every, now and then the little Llda
Valley in Southwestern . Nevada waxes
up and itself an Important mining
center. ! Thfe spasmodic existence dates
far back to the daj-3 when the Indians
I and SparJards first found gold in the
\ hills. . AVlth their t primitive means they
took all they could and departed. Then
! came the early prospector who called
the others fools for having left so much
\ behind, and In his turn departed thinking
he had exhauÃted the valley. From that
j day till the discovery of gold at Tonopah
the Liria Valley enjoyed a nice, long:
J sleep. But now it Is awake once more.
Mining men pouring Into Tonopah and
Goldneld have not teen slow to reflnd
the ; valley. Mines . that were aban
doned years ago, wnen machinery was so
scarce and primitive that it was Im
possible to work them to the fullest ad
vantage, have been reopened, and daily
tons of paying ore are being taken out.
Old mines like the Lida Belle, Buster.
Death Valley and Florida, all fortune
makers for their owners in the past, are
being again developed to the good proflt
of their proprietors.
\u25a0Besides these old deposits, the erosion
and storms of years have at last washed
away the soil, in many places and laid
bare rich veins' unsuessed before. Nearly
all the gold found is free, and in addition
the quartz is full of black copper, silver,
iron pxides^and silver chlorides. To make
matters still better the hills about the
valley are densely wooded and the wafer
supply is a most unusual one for such a
parched desert region- '
Already two main mining groups, the
Lida-Detroit and the Caledonia, are mak
ing a name for the valley. The " first
covers an extensive, well defined vein,
whose ore runs up to^lSO a ton. A3 yet
the values of \ the Caledonia have not
run as hish t but some of thla ore 13 of
the same ' composition aj. that of' the
famous Florence and Wisconsin. These I
are the richest, but there ace thousands
of' tons of lower grade ore scattered
throughout the valley; the owners only
waiting for the coming railroad to con
nect this district with the- Santa Fe and
Salt Lake main lines before shipping It
with good profits.

: It is very f orttmata . that at a tlm*
when the fertile valleys of Nevada are
about to be brought under cukivation
by means of irrigation there ia a gen
eral revival of mining all over tha
j State. Not since the great Comstock.
Eureka, Austin and Pioche mines were
discovered have so many valuable
mines been opened as to-day. Such dis
coveries have put new life and energy
in i every man and every industry in
the State. Six hundred million dollars
in" gold and sliver were produced .from
the Comstock mines alone. While that
precious metal was going into the chan
nels of trade and commerce, business
of every nature in Nevada and the sur
rounding States was most prosperous
and remunerative. The- production from
i the .rich and extensive mines of South -
; western Nevada recently discovered, it
is .estimated by leading mining men
and engineers, will exceed the total
output of gold and silver from the Corn
stock." If this proves trueâ and . thero
is every, reason to believe that the pre
diction will be verifiedâ thÂ« , halcyon
days of ; the early times in Nevada will
again reappear, and all. the. products
raised on the newly opened lands
brought under cultivation- by the bene
ficent irrigation act will find ready
markets , and at good prices, and tha
large population surely to follow in tha
wake of progress and prosperity ..will
make Nevada one of the grandest

- viirigatlon began in Nevada a little
over '\u25a0 fifty years ago, when the rush
to, the gold mines of California brought
thousands over the plains and deserts.
Where the. overland trails met and fol
lowed the â¢ natural water ways, trad
ing posts were established. The posts
on the mountain streams on the east
ern' slopes of , the Sierras were espe
cially prosperous. The creeks were eas
ily, diverted- to flood the adjoining land
and vegetables, hay and grain' brought
su,ch fabulous prices that many turned
their attention to farming.
"Later the lands along the main riv
ers were taken up and irrigated by
means of simple ditches. In all of the
valleys so much land is now under Ir
rigation that the summer flow Is not
sufficient for present ; needs. Storage of
the Â» flood ': waters '.and a better system
of distributing canals are necessary to

? At no time during the history of the
mine has it looked so well as to-day,
and .considering: the great area of
ground -which we own north of our
shaft and which we are now develop
ing, together with the great strike In
the Midway, adjoining our west line
and which Is now within 100 feet of the
came, and the equally important and
late strike In the Golden Anchor (both
of these strikes meaning almost as
much to our company as to their own)
I feel fully Justified in saying that our
future ia exceedingly bright."
This article can be fitly concluded by
the following; extract from the last re
port of General Manager D. B. Gillies
dated April 1, 1905:- ;
The future plans of the management
include the sinking of a new triple
compartment shaft, twenty-one feet by
five ieet, located 500 feet north of the
present shaft. This shaft, -which will
shortly be commenced, will be fitted
with two skipways and will be sunk
to a depth of 1000 feet and will cut the
Macdonald vein at that level. It will
also enable the new. "A. B. K." vein
to be developed to better advantage.
In addition to this, exhaustive experi
ments have been conducted for the
solving of the problem of the economi
cal treatment of the lower grade ores
at the mine and the erection of a plant
for this purpose is under consideration.
Financially . the company is in excel
Â«?LAÂ° n 2 ltlon - O* the treasury stock
160,000 shares are unissued, and the
company also has a large cash reserve
constantly increased by the 'returns
from ore shipments. Over 110 men are
constantly employed at the mine,
which, except for slight repairs to.ma
chlneryi has been worked continuously
since August2S, 1902. The present phy
sical condition of the mine is' highly
satisfactory. There are on the dumps
nearly 30,000 tons of payable milling
ore, and 'many thousands of tons of
both milling ' and high grade shipping
ore blocked out 'in the mine, the aim
of the management having been rather
to create great ore reserves than a rec
ord of an immense output. And only
one-Eixth of the ' company's property
has been explored. l - \u25a0'"â¢-
The Montana-Tonopah mine is well
equipped vith a nfty-rorseyower steam
hoist,^ capable of sinking to a depth
of 10C0 feet, ore crushers operated by
electricity, electric light plant, : four
arm Ingersoll-Sargeant compressor
plant and crude oil is used exclusively
far fuel, and it is the only company
using this fuel.
The officers of the company are
Charles E. Knox, president; E. C. El
lis, vice president; G. F. Badgett. sec
ond vice president; Edgar Knox, sec
retary and treasurer, while Charles E.
Morris, son of the late \V. W. Morris,
Is also a director. Malcolm L. Mac
donald, late of Butte, Mont., Is consult
ing engineer, and Donald B. Gillies is
general manager and superintendent.
Mr. Gillies Is a young man who grad-
Mfted with the degree of E. M. from
the Michigan School of Mines and was
for eight years general superintendent
of Senator Clark's Montana . copper
mines, two years superintendent of the
Parrott mine at Butte and two years
superintendent of the Pittsburg-Mon
tana mine at Butte. and he will un
doubtedly add ro his brilliant recc-rd
at this great mine.
With ample funds in the treasury
the comoany commenced \u25a0 work on
August 28. 1902, by breaking ground
for the existing double compartment
shaft, the site for which was selected
by G. F. Badgett, to whom great cred
it is due for his excellent judgment
in this difficult matter." From that
day Mr. Badgett personally superin
tended the development of the mine
t until October, 1904, when, he resigned
to accept the less arduous position of
second vice president of. the company. -
The sinking of this shaft inauru
rated the system of "blind Kinking"
which has required as much courage
by mine operators and has made Ton
opah the famous camp it is to-day. In
a period of 107 days the shaft was
sunk and timbered a depth of 372 feet
through the overlying capping to the
lode bearing porphyry and, penetrat
ing this four feet, the first ore body
v.as encountered. This success stim
ulated interest in the development of
the mine, which Is watched with ea
gerness not only locally, but wherever
Tonopah is known.
The shaft has now reached a depth
of 765 feet, with cross-cuts north and
couth from four levels and six paral
lel veins have been discovered and
explored by drifts, winzes and raises,
the total amount of underground
workings exceeding 10,000 feet or
nearly two miles.
The principal work in the mine has
been done on what are -known as the
"south" and "Macdonald" veins, which
are admitted to be two of the master
veins of the Tonopah district.
Both have produced and are still
producing a splendid grade of shipping
ore as well as a considerable tonnage
of the most wonderful specimen ore yet
found In this wonderful camp. This
high grade ore is found in recurring
shoots, some of which are of great
length and width and one in the Mac
donald vein now being worked is so
rich In ruby silver that the miners have
named the drift "ruby alley."
These veins have the general charac
teristics of -the Tonopah veins, an east
and west course dipping to the north
and varying in width from three feet
to thirty-six feet, the latter the width
of the great Macdonald vein. The ore
Is a white quartz, carrying gold and
sliver. In the oxidized ores the silver
occurs as a chloride, in the sulphide
ores the silver is argentite, ruby and
Etephanite with occasional patches , of
copper pyrites. The permanence and
values of these veins have been proved
to the depth of 700 feet and their con
tinuity has been demonstrated by their
discovery In the Midway and Golden
Anchor mines, the former having
opened up the "south" vein at a point
650 feet west of the Montana shaft, and
the latter having cut the "Macdonald"
vein over 1400 feet west of the bound
ary line. On the east, In the North
Star mine, â¬21 feet from the Montana
shaft, the south veld has been cut and
these developments demonstrate the
continuity of the veins through the en
tire length of the Montana ground. In
addition to the veins already mentioned
two new veins known as the "A. B. K."
and "Martha" have recently been
opened up on the 600 and 600 foot levels
end the importance of this discovery
can hardly be overestimated. . The
"Martha" is four feet wide of shipping
grade, and the "A. B. K." has not yet
been opened up to. any great extent;'
The present shipments amount to
about 40 tons per day, which could
easily bo increased to 150 tons if the
Tonopab Railroad could supply cars for
this quantity. The mine enjoys the dis
tinction of hai'ing shipped out ' the
richest ore from the Tonopah district,
Its first shipment of twenty-six tons
netted $8787 EB. and a shipment in Jan
uary of this year, forty-eight " tons,
127.000.
The company has also the record of
having paid the first dividend in Tono
pah. This was on December 20,; 1903,
when five cents per share was distrib
uted among Its stockholders. Since
May, 1903, the company has not only
been self-sustaining and has paid the
above mentioned dividend, but the sum
sf $18,000 wag paid for the Triangle
fraction and $22,000 was expended on
the construction of railroad tracks to
the mine. This would be a remarkable
record for a mine In the most favored
tountry, but it is phenomenal when
jt is remembered that for two years
the mine was developed under the ad
ferse conditions of a desert country,
*ixty milea from a railroad, .
The property owned by the company
comprises thirteen full mining claims
and three f ractional claims, all pat
ented, and covering an area of about
160 rÂ»cres on the western slope and base
of Mount Oddie, and giving a length of
over 4000 feet across the trend of the
mineral-bearing system which ema
nates from that mountain.
At that time the many nostlle critics
of Tonopah declared that it was but a
"one-mine camp," and that it was
doubtful If the ore bodies would "go
down." These statements added to the
prevailing prejudice against the State
of Nevada, and the fact that the
Tonopah Mining Company had been
operating only a few months made the
task of disposing of the treasury stock
one of grteat difficulty. Yet with the
confidence which so often brings suc
cess It was undertaken and success
fully accomplished by Mr. Charles E.
Knox, who received the hearty support
of the late Mr. W. W. Morris of Pony,
Mont., who not only subscribed for a
large block of the stock, but remained
an ardent believer in the success of the
mine up to the day of his deeply re
gretted death. * .
Among the great mines of Tonopah
deserving of special mention none is
more worthy of this distinction than
the Montana Tonopah, . the second in
the camp to ship ore and the first to
pay a dividend. The Montana Tono
pah Mining Company was organized
In August, 1902, with a capital of
1 1,000,000. divided Into one million
shares of SI each, of which 200,000
"were placed in the treasury.
The ground owned hy the company
was selected and secured by Charles
E. Knox of Philadelphia, and
although no veins outcropped on the
surface, his excellent Judgment has
been well borne out by the subsequent
remarkable developments, and to-day
with the full knowledge of the* district
no better claims could have been pur
chased.

Goldfleld, ' situated about thirty miles
south .of Tonopah,' was â¢ discovered 'In
October; 1902. It' was named the Grandpa
District,:. but was reorganized In Septem
ber, 1903, under; the name of Goldfield.
The first discoveries { of particular impor
tance began In JamrtYry,- 1904. ,
The ; geological conditions', of ; the camp
have not" been thoroughly. -worked out,
butso far as known are not.very differ
ent from, those /existing at Tonopah. The
country | rocks, V as gj shown B by outcrops,
are. largely rhyolltes;!with',llmestone ap
pearing ; in ; one [ or, two '; instances. Deeper
work, however,;; has uncovered andesltes
which seem, to >be entirely like, those of
thfe Tonopah -District. These are cut? by
heavy, persistent 1 reefs of quartz, locally
often designated as quartzites on account
of \ their -resemblance to .true quartzite.
These reefs, are f with little doubt true
fissure veins; of large proportions.
'â¢V Their, strike Is. in a general north 'and
south' direction and the dlp.ls'very nearly
vertical. The richer ores occur In regu- I
lar, persistent chutes in these reefs. Sin
gle chutes have in several in
stances-produced hundreds of
thousands ". 'of \u25a0 dollars/ and this
only to "the shallow depth that they
have been worked thus far. In addition
to these quartz ' reefs occuring In ande
slto are ;. similar reefs apparently In
rhyolite, in -which some: of the highest
values of s the camp^ have been found.
These . rhybllte "l reefs ! are r probably more
widely.: distributed than ;those in ande
site, and discoveries In them' at the pres-'
ent time cover . an area of not less than
fifteen <sauare; miles. v\ '"â¢'. * \u25a0
FACTS $ ABOUT . GOLDFIELD.
East, south and southwest of the Tono
pah Company's property are other mines,
viz.: The- Belmont," Stone!. Cabin, Wan
dering Boy, Gold Hill, California, Jim
Butler, Fraction ' and .West ' End, which
have been . compelled k to sink to various
depths through the capping or later ande
sitelto reach the lode-bearing porphyry.
* :, The; ores of .the Tonopah . Company are
oxidized, i which \u25a0is explained by the out
cropping : ; of the ' veins,',' while all the
veins by the later andeslto are
sulphides. - The -values , are gold and^ sil
ver, running about two-sevenths gold "and
flve-severiths; silver. The general strike
Is feasterly .- and westerly ;V and I the general
dip is to .the north. ; The width of veins
varies from three; to forty feet and . they
have been developed to a depth of 1100
feet: ; :'â¢ :\u25a0 '. --'/ ; â¢ " -:;â¢\u25a0\u25a0:
"Taking the above facts ajid knowing the
underground conditions .as they actually
exist, I consider Tonopah as yet in its
infancy. ...
The . : veins of the Tonopah Company's
property outcropping at -the surface
made it possible \u25a0\u25a0 for â¢ them to mine and'
ship ore immediately, and the early his
tory will show that ; millions -of dollars
had been taken out, principally by leas
ers, before ; the company commenced ac
tive operations.: - v ; .
coveries.
Owing to the wonderful developments
in the Tonopah Extension mine, the re
cent discovery in the Golden Anchor
and the quiet determination with which
John McKane Is expending vast sums
of money In tne exploration of his
other properties, the whole of the west
ern part of the camp contiguous to his
companies claims - Is experiencing ran
activity which almost amounts to the
premonitory symptoms of a boom.'. :
Some recently formed corporations
ere now selling treasury stock and pre
paring to commence operations, others
are from one year to two years old and
are not now working, and have : not
done * sufficient work to properly ex
plore their claims at depth. Among the
former may be named the Monarch
Plttsburg Extension, Tonopah Gold
Standard, Tonopah Common, Red Rock
Extension, Tonopah Wall Street, Pltts
burg Extension and .Manhattan Tono
pah. Among the latter are the Cash
Boy, Little. Tonopah Development Com
pany, Tonopah Great Western, Tonopah
Golden Gate, Tonopah West. .
While it is exceedingly hazardous to
venture any predictions as to the fu
/. . *
has Just commenced and will be carried
on with the activity and energy' charac
teristic of all Mr. McKane's undertakings.
Adjoining the Bed Rock Consolidated
Mining Company's claims on the, south is
the property of the Ohio Tonopah Mining
Company, comprising six claim's, on which
a shaft has been sunk to a depth of 785
feet, and drifts and crosscuts amounting
to over 1300 feet have been driven. Al
though there have lately been persistent
rumors of an important discovery of ore
the local management denies the state
. rnent. The property is largely owned by
Cleveland, Ohio, capitalists and was closed
i down for a long time for lack of funds.
Plttsburg capitalists are now interested
in the company. The ground is well lo
cated and It seems probable that some
veins will be discovered.
West of the McKane Mining Company
is a gtoxiv of seven claims, owned by the
West Tonopah Mining Company, which
was organized last year and, commenced
operations: in September. The company's
shaft is located 2500 feet west of the Me-"
Kane Company's shaft, and is now down
nearly 203 feet, the intention being to
cink to a depth of 500 feet and crosscut
to a vein which outcropped on the surface
and carried milling values," and close to
which float quartz was. found averaging
Jb4 per ton.

RAILROAD FACILITIES.
In the early days lumberwas eagerly
sought for at $400 per thousand. "To-day,
with railroad facilities hundreds of miles
nearer to the scene of present activity,
prices are reasonable, but in some of the
outlying districts lumber sells readily for
$100 per thousand; hay for $00' per ton,
grain at $7 per 100 pounds and other
necessities in proportion. These condi
tions have .rendered almost prohibitive
the prospecting of this particular area.
ZTie region .has always been reputed to
be rich in "mineral, yet the hardships
and the inability to procure supplies
have kept it virgin ground up to within
the past few years. Numerous, have
been the expeditions fitted out for its
conquest, but without success until the
returning army of prospectors from
Alaska, Africa and South America, with
the added experience afforded by these
districts, spurred on by .the thought
that this was their last chance, have
at last carried the hitherto impregnable
fortress.
The discovery of; Tonopah within the
border of this region of volcanics has in
fused fresh life and awakened a new in
terest in this vast and virgin field, and as
a consequence new development work has
been gradually encroaching upon the
comparatively unknown area from the
north with results that have been ex
tremely gratifying to all who â¢ have an
interest in the venture. First Tonopah,
then Goldfleld, followed by Bullfrog.
Kawich, Lida and other .camps. And
this Is but a beginning, for beyond lies
the great Ralston desert and Death Val
ley, which are practically unknown and
unexplored regions to-day. Mr. Spurr of
the United States Geological g Survey,
who has made a general reconnaissance
survey of the State, calls attention to the
fact that this general belt of volcanics
with outlying limestones and quartzites,
with almost identical conditions, can be
traced through Into Old Mexico.
quartzite: districts.
With this invasion of the great central
area and improvement in transportation
facilities comes a renewed interest in
the adjoining quartzite and limestone
districts, where silver and sulphide ores
are found.. At the present time the ores
from these districts are largely shipped
to Salt Lake, and are paying the heavy
freight tariff that only comparatively
wealthy ores are able to .bear. Now in
mining operations the prevailing condi
tion, and one that is well-nigh universal,
is that where rich ores are present in
great quantities leaner ores are present
In still greater quantities. Therefore, we
have abundant reason to assume that a
cheaper method of treatment 'ill at once
manifold the available ore reserves in
many districts that so far have been
mined only for the high-grade ores they
were able to produce.
It is a noteworthy fact that silicious
ores shipped from ; \u25a0 these districts " are
worked in lead furnaces, and this sug
gests the possibility of working the low
grade silicious gold and silver ores with
the low-grade silver-lead ores at points
within the district, where .. they may be
conveniently assembled, and thus reduce
the long distance haul and excessive
freight charges, making it possible to
work some of the large bodies of low
grade ore which cannot now be : handled.-
While prospectors arc -in search of
gold-silver ores they should bear in mind
that the lead-silver and also copper ores
are fully as desirable and profitable. Ow
ing to the excessive freight and treat
ment charges they are even more so' at
the present time than the average grade
ore now being discovered in the new
camps. While they are in search of rich
er ores it would be well to advise them
to prospect for or give the lead-Bilver
cres some attention, as it is only a. mat
ter of a few years when all Euch ores as
are now being shipped to Salt Lake .will
be treated in the district. . It fs . only a
question ' of * fuel and the " transportation
of smelter machinery j to . make It profit
able to now treat the ores in . this dis
trict, as there are now being found sufffl
clent'fluxes to handle all of the. silicious
product. * ;
Recent experiments have demonstrated
Commencing with the discovery of gold
and silver on the Comstock, in ISSB, and
covering the time until about the year
1890, the camps of Reveille, Pioche, White
Pine, De Lamar, Austin. Belmont, Tybo,
Tuscarora (Bull Run), Candelaiia, Auro
ra, Hamilton, Hiko. Pine Grove, Cortez,
Silver Peak, Hawthorne, Silver Star and
many other cmaller camps were worked,
producing an enormous sum, estimated
at about $900,000,000 in gold and silver.
To this may be added about $160,000,000
for the lead-silver product of Eureka,
the district which. In its day, controlled
the lead market of the world. Most 'of
these camps are In the limestone-quartz
lte areas, and are located to the north,
cast and west sides of the section that
has come into prominence more recently.
In the limestone-quartzlte area nume
rous springs are found and water is com
paratively plentiful, while in the vol
canic area It is very scarce; the result
which quite naturally follows from this
condition has been that the limestones
were extensively prospected and devel
oped in the early days when the above
named silver-lead camps were discov
ered, while an immense desert area in
the very heart of this volcanic region
has for many years past been bidding
defiance to our most courageous pio
neers. Across this section eighty miles
Is not an unusual stage without water.
Distances of sixty miles -were of fre
quent occurrence, while drives of twen
ty-five and thirty, or even forty, have
been so common as to occasion no sur
prise. Add to this the fact that forage
was at all times scarce and over large
areas absolutely unprocurable, it Is not
surprising that even the most hardy
prospector should recoil from a region
A etudy of the geological and topo
graphical formation of this section and a
knowledge of the peculiar conditions will
Cive the best answer. In the map of the
region there will be noticed two lines
running in a general southerly direction
âone commencing at a point to the
north and west of Austin, the other
just below Wabuska. These lines mark
approximately thoroughly defined and
differing geological formations the
country lying between the lines being
en area in which the rocks are almost
exclusively of volcanic origin, com
prising a series of andesltes, rhyolites
end basalts, with their accompanying
volcanic ashes, while to the north, east
and west the formations are largely
6edlmentary, comprising a series of an
cient limestones and quartzites. It Is
generally within this area of volcanics
that the rich finds of recent years have
been made.
COGEXT COXSIDERATIOX.
For the past fifteen years Nevada has
been looked upon and talked of as a
wornout district by men conversant with
mining affairs, its possibilities forgotten
and overlookedâ overshadowed by the al
lurements of the Klondike and other
fields. Now comes the opening of this
new vast field of mineral wealth. The
natural Inquiry presents itself â how is it
possible that. In a 6ection reputed to be
the birthplace of the American prospec
tor, this Immense wealth has remained
undiscovered? And this, too, at a period
wheu Nevada prospectors were traveling
to the ends of the earth In search of gold
âto Alaska, to South Africa, to South
America, enduring hardships and braving
dangers hitherto unknown.
Nei-ada, since the year IESB. has occu
pied the attention, more or less, of the
mining world. At no period in the his
tory of the StaKe has that attention been
so vivid and widespread, extending to all
classes as during the past few years.
Statements, apparently extravagant, have
been published of the great riches and
vast extent of the new finds. An Intimate
knowledge of the older districts of the
State, together with a personal examina
tion of a great many of the discoveries
which have been made in the past few
years, would seem to warrant the ex
travagant assertions which have appeared
from time to time In the press. The half
has not been told and it needs but the
most cursory inspection of the deposits
already opened up to bear out the state
ment that this new El Dorado will rival
the world's record in its product.

Kawich, the newest of the- camps, was
discovered, in December. , 1904. It , is situ
ated in the Kawich Range, about fifty
five" miles east <at Goldfield. Owing to
isolation and scarcity of water - the de
velopment of the camp has naturally
been clow. Recently, . however, an abun
dant supply of water, for domestic pur
poses has been' discovered. .
The surface showing in this camp was
the most ' flattering of any Jlbvada camp
yet discovered.^ Strong, well-defined, per-
THE KATOCH CAMP.
- The particular feature- of this district
Is the abundant supply of water for mill
ing and other purposes in the Amargosa
River, which flows in a southwesterly di
rection through the center of the" district.
Water from this source is being piped to
the town of Bullfrog, a distance of about
eleven miles. It is. also reported' that
water will be brought from the same
source to the town .of < Rbyollte, both . of
these towns being situated some dis
tance from the river, while in the towns
of- Beatty and Gold Center, both of which
are situated on -the banks of tuo Amar
gosa, water \u25a0 can be had anywhere at a
depth of -ten or fifteen feet.
\u25a0 The ore-bearing formation of the camp
Is â¢ universally a rhyolite, probably the
o.uest rock . In the district. This is cut
in a general north and | south I direction,
by a series of quartz veins of varying
thickness,' and these quartz veins . show
values on the surface over> a wide area.
The development .work In the Montgom
cry-Shoshone has disclosed the fact that
these north and south fissures ar a cut
by an east and west fissure of much
larger proportions, carrying very high
values and from which regular shipments
are now being made. .
.Among the mines attracting particular
attention at the present time us the
following: The Clark Benson Group, the
National Bank, the Denver, the Original
Bullfrog; the Montgomery Mountain,

IS NEVER DISCOURAGED. \u25a0
Mining history Is full of Instances of
men who became too easily discouraged
and thereby lost great properties. Tay
lor/ did Â» not find' the Jumbo and then
pick up a million dollars. He had to
make compensation to nature . for her
gift,;. Even theC Spokajne| capitalist 'be
came 1 discouraged with'; the prospects

that he will persevere to the bitter end.

not ibeen constructed at that time and

there Is a clean profit of about $100,000

history of mining many of the great
est - values in precious metals have
been found at great depth. With only
two hundred and fifty feet of the Jour
ney already traveled, Taylor and his
companions have every reason to ex
pect great things farther on. There are
other fabulously rich - mines In the
Goldfield district, but none show more
promise to-day than the Jumbo. ' It has
produced more than any other claim in
Tonopah mining district, and Its limits
cannot be denned. Taylor gives his and
his brother's Interests- as 42": . per

D. Taylor owns much tha larger part
of this amount.. Of course an outsider
would say that his discovery and lo

LITIGATION IS SETTLED.
The results are expected, of course, to
many more times than pay for the Im
mense outlay. But these conditions are
almost ideal when compared with what
Taylor had to contend with when he
started. Then tha task of reaching the
Jumbo was something calculated to
daunt even the most determined of
men. All the way from Reno there is
nothing but brown and occasionally
pink hills and immejrSe "washes" or
valleys covered with sagebrush,
greasewood, cactus and rattlesnakes.
It is the most discouraging outlook
that could be Imagined. Yet the Jumbo
would never have been Taylor's had he
not been ready to face all this and
much more. He is calm and cool and
very deliberate, his training: and his
nature make him cautious, his ambi
tions have stimulated his natural cour
age,- his privatipns and hardships/have
made him rugged. He takes all he
hears with the proverbial grain of salt
and is not apparently the man to take
long chances, preferring rather to hew
his way through the tangles in abso
lute certainty of his course. It^took
just such a man as this to do ana dare
enough to locate million-dollar mine*.
Had he retained what rightfully might
have been his he would have possessed
to-day the biggest part of the wealth
which has come from the Jumbo and
the Florence. He made so many splits
in the property by accepting partner
ships and 1 by leasing that he secured
far less ; than he might have had.
Nevertheless he Is to-day one of the
richest men in the State of Nevada

the road to the Jumbo ends. With
all these transfers travel Is unpleasant
and freight is transferred only at great
expense of money and of time. In the
development of the Jumbo the expense
of transporting machinery, timber and
building material will be exorbitant.
The manner in which the company was
first Incorporated brings back unpleas
ant memories. Taylor believes the at
torney who did the work should have
been trenching for veins instead of at
tempting to place an Immense business
project on . a firm foundation. Much
trouble has been caused from time to
time as a result of blunders in the
original work. Recently Taylor em
ployed ex-Governor Budd for his at
torney, and that lawyer has been able
to get most of the hard knots out of
the tangle. The corporation papers'are
all legal and up to date in every re
spect. Taylor has the greatest con-
carried his samples of rock on his back
for the entire distance of twenty-eight
miles. " At later dates he was often,
compelled to make the trip on foot.
Horses were scarce and renting them
was highly expensive. Then the animals
drank comparatively great quantities of
water and Adam's ale was valuable in
the desert. It was a. weary trip over
forbidding country, but Taylor stood
manfully to his task. He realized at
last that he had made a tremendous
strike and that his fortune was ahead
of him. It had cost him more than
fifteen years of life, but he had gained
more than the great majority of men
can accumulate In forty veaxs of ac
tivity combining Industry with so
briety. Taylor is not at all talkative,
but when he can be Induced to discuss
his achievement, he makes light of his
struggles and hardships. He likes the
study of phrenology and hygiene very
much. The results of his labors In the
desert provide him with the oppor
tunities to study those subjects or
which he has been so anxious to learn
for many years. This then is the man
that Providence selected to bring to the
light of the world the gold that lay be
neath those stretches of sagebrush land
that the hardy miner chose to call tha
Jumbo, the Florence and the Red Kins.
He does not regret so much the part
ing with a third of the property, thÂ©
sale of his Interest In the Florence for
a totally inadequate sum or the loss
suffered by the inproper leasing of the
hundred foot blocks on the Jumbo. He
takes these unfortunate . transactions
in the light of later developments as
matters to be regretted, but they do
not rankle In his mind.

\Vhen he arrived in San Francisco he
had a small amount of money to show
for his many years of hard work in
the great Northwest. Putting aside a
certain sum for emergencies, Taylor
resolutely decided to take up the pro
fessional siuily of phrenology.
After receiving a diploma. Profes
sor Taylor started on a lecture tour
for the purpose of delineating charac
ter by means of phrenological develop
ment- His finances, however, began to
run low and he had about made up his
mind to return to prospecting, when
he heard 'of thp severe Illness of his
brother at Bodie, California. He im
mediately ceased his lectures and went
to the aid of his brother, nursing him
through a severe illness with the sim
ple curee he had learned in the North
western wilds. â¢ .: ";
and Northwest, he determined to leave
home and home ties to seek his fortune.
In the course of years he mined in
the Rocky Mountains, Just north of the
boundary line between the United
States and British Columbia; at Illicil-
Uwaet 'in British Columbia;, in the
Kootenay district; in the country
about Fish Creeks Lardeau and Duncan
River, and In many other places. Fin
ally he decided to come to California.
The change was prompted by several
reasons, among them the desire to see
his brother, whom he had not met
for some time. The thought that his
brother was in California naturally
turned .his. mind toward this State.
The reports of successful strikes' being
made in the golden -region of Nevada
were slowly reaching the Northwestern
country and the frequent disappoint
ments in the location of mineral wealth
in the Canadian country aided in form
ing his resolution.
ARDENT PROSPECTOR
WHO FINDS MILLIONS
The career of a man who has spent
the greater part of his life in the wilds
of the North American continent,
trudging through forests and over
heights of wild and rugged mountains
in the search for gold, always contains
many Incidents of romantic Interest,
and the life of C. D. Taylor is no ex
ception to the rule.
Froxn the time he was 21 until his
great strike in the "Jumbo" mine,
with the exception of a few months
spent each winter in the endeavor to
rain money for further prospecting
trips, Mr. Taylor has devoted every
energy to the pursuit of hidden gold.
The pursuit involved- many trials and
hardships that only the hardiest
natures dare face and a degree of re
sourcefulness that few are bleet with.
Mr. Taylor attributes to a great ex
tent his success and hardy qualities to
the good old English stock from which
he is descended on his father's side
of the family, commingled with the
English and Huguenot blood of his
mother's side. Mr. Taylor's father
was a farmer of humble origin in
Kings County, Nova Scotia, at & time
when the subject of this sketch was
born, on January 4, 1563.
The farm barely sufficed to support
the family of ten children, for Mr. Tay
lor had seven sisters and two brothers,
and the father took to the study of
law and politics.
- Young Taylor, however, as soon as he
had attained his majority was no
longer satisfied to stay on a farm or
seek work in a little country place,
where the reward for labor at best
was meager. Having read many book?
of rtie discovery of gold and the large
fortunes being: made In the Far West
The Jumbo is as big a mine
as its name implies. It is, of course, of
the regulation sizeâ that is, 1500- feet
long, by 600 feet wideâ but the ledge
is a big one. The company own four
claims. The outlay of , a tremendous
amount of money is warranted by the
results already obtained and by the
indications of more values and the
company is prepared to invest such an
amount as may seem best for the de
velopment of the property. Some of
them have. made a. great deal of money
outside of the Jumbo, the Florence and
Red King mines as well, and are pre
pared to advance their other individual
interests in the district. Water was
a valuable asset in the Goldfield coun
try, and is appearing in the lower lev
els of the mines, but in future they will
be better prepared to overcome it by
pumping. There is some water" in the
Jumbo and it will cost a great deal of
money to keep the mine dry In the
future. Then, again, mills, will have
to be constructed. Another expense is
transportation. A mine that would be
worth a fortune in California with
wood, water and moderate freight
charges might be utterly worthless In
the Goldfield country. The construc
tion of the narrow-, gauge road from
Sodaville to Tonopah was some help in
solving the freight problem. But the
rates are tremendously high when
judged by the standards of Callfor
nians or Easterners. The owners of
the road have a monopoly, of course,
and can exact all the traffic will bear.
Many mines, in "the Goldfleld country
are not shipping the ore" at present, but
await better freight rates. The owners

Most of the-incorporators were prac
tical miners and knew something of
the workings of both schemes. On a
million-dollar proposition the figuring
needs to be done very carefully that a
few thousand dollars will .â¢: not : drop
through the holes in the .plan occa

ers at last to lease the claim and sit
down to watch: the 'lessees extract the
gold. There were plenty of . applica
tions for leases, so there was' no dif
ficulty on ' this . score. . But here \ again
there was 'trouble. ' In the drawing up
of mining leases experience has shown
that the greatest (care is necessary, on
th part of the lawyers. The others
knew much of stripping veins and rnn
nlng drifts, but had never studied the
intricacies of, the; law. As a result the
Jumbo leases. were drawn- in'- such 'a
shape, as to bring Joy, to the hearts of
the lessees. . The claim was cut up into
blocks of which L the length' in ;each
case was 100 feet. - The < owners were
to get about a fifth of. the gross pro
duction. On the Bowes-Kernlck' lease
great damage .was done : through ne

contract. -Some >of those who made
very, fortunate investments in getting
their leases were McKane, Dacy G
Zinn, Ridge and Curtis .McDonald!
Zinn extracted about $125,000. Ridge
and Curtis got about $130,000; and Mc-
Kane and partners extracted , about
$500,000. On the block numbered 8 and
called the Bqwes-Kernick lease, the
leases \u25a0 were '~ to ; expire on the last day
of December,^ 1904, . with a i single', ex

MERE PRACTICAL MIXERS.
There . was some discussion between
the partners as to whether the mine
should be worked by themselves or
bonded. The latter scheme was decid
ed upon as the better in view of the
financial and other difficulties to be en
countered otherwise. On October"' 4.
1903, negotiations resulted in the bond
ing of 70 per cent of the Jumbo and
adjacent claims, to "Patsy" Clark" and
John Mclvane for $100,000. Prepara
tions were at once made for working
the property.
March 23, 1904, the miners commenced
to work as a company under the name
of the Jumbo Mining Company of Gold
field. George K. McClelland, who had
been in partnership with Taylor while
the latter was still prospecting, had
been originally given a fifth interest.
Under the terms of incorporation he
received an IS per cent interest. George
A. Kernick had- paid comparatively
nothing for his third interest and when
the company incorporated he received
a 30 per cent interest.. Mcivane kept
his 10 per cent interest. C. D. Taylor
and H. L. Taylor retained a 42 per
cent interest. C. D. I Taylor, the dis
coverer, is president, H. L. Taylor is
vice president, C. P. Holt secretary
and treasurer. Everything : looked
promising and various. plans were sug
gested .as to the best means of ex
tracting the gold from its hiding places

wanted to work the mine independent

showed 1 a width of nearly two and a
half feet. The rock carried encourag
ing values in gold, but. Taylor at that
time had no idea of the fabulous
wealth contained in his discovery.
G. A. McClelland had a fifth interest
with Taylor from the start, but the
credit for the great undertaking be
longs almost entirely to the locator
Iroiti British Columbia.
Taylor returned to tl%c region of
Tonopah on May 21. Within two
months after the first big find thirteen
other claims in the neighborhood were
bought and located. This involved a
great deal of work, in order that the
assessment work misht, be done to se
cure the possessory title. The locator
worked Itidefatigably and secured his
merited rewards. During the second
week of the August following. Taylor
returned to the Goldfield District to
work on the Jumbo, Florence and Red
King claims. The Maud S was aban
doned, but it has since, been relocated
as the Atlanta. On his .return, the
miner discovered on the Jumbo > lead
about three feet of gold ore. which on
being panned showed a long streak of
fine flakes of the yellow, metal. Sam
ples were taken to an assaver and the
value was found to be $135 a ton. an
average value for three feet. Previous
to learning the value of this ore. Tay
lor sold George A. Kernick a third in
terest in the Jumbo, Florence and Red
King claims. Kernick had an interest
with Taylor in several other properties
and it was finally decided that he
should have a share in the three mines
on which the work was being done.
There was some haggling over the
price and Kernick. with extrem* re
luctance, purchased a third interest in
the undeveloped mines at a very low
figure.. It brought him over $200,000.
The first assays encouraged the miners
to proceed rapidly with their work.
Shortly afterward the lead showed six
feet in width and assayed about 5300 a
ton. ' â¢ -
The Jumbo mine, which has proved
the greatest producer in the new min
eral fields of Southern Nevada. Is lo
cated about one and one-quarter miles
cast cf the town of Goldfield. Its his
tory is one of absorbing interest to
those who burrow the earth In search
of precious metals. While the Jumbo
has brought forth nearly a million dol
lars, this immense amount of wealth
has been secured only as the result of
en Infinite amount of labor and the ap
plication of information which it took
the locator years to acquire. To the
uninitiated It seems like a special dis
pensation from the fickle Goddess of
Fortune for a man to come upon so
great a mineral deposit. To those who
know, however, come visions of years
cf hardship and privation, month on
month of discouragement and distress
and eternal battles against adverse
circumstances. While C D. Taylor,
the discoverer of the Jumbo, was in
Bodle, Oil., tn the spring: of 1902, nurs
ing his sick brother, he began to .hear
tales cf the wor.derful richness of
the Tonopah raining: district. After
making the necessary preparations he
left for Nevada and arrived in Tono

some time he prospected the country
In the vicinity of the new camp, but his
experience showed him that none of
his discoveries were of practical value

to developing water for Tono-
-After mature consideration, he deter
mined to enter what was then known
as the Grandpa District and Is now
known as the Goldfleld region. On
May 17, 1903, he left Tonopah and
started on his journey in the rough
and barren country which has since
proved so rich in mineral wealth. On
May 19, Taylor located the Jumbo, the
Florence, Red King and another prop
erty, called the Maud S, which has
not proved of any great value. This
group of claims has turned out
abour $2,100,000. These were thy
first discoveries south of Columbia

week before the rich Combination mine
was discovered by Myers and Hart.

in the bringing of this neces

for several months and all his expedi
tions were started from this point.
After studying the question of where
he should next commence prospecting,
he came to the conclusion that there
might be opportunities of striking
something worth while in what is
known as the Cloverdale country. On
April 12, 1903. lie set out from
Tonopah for Red Springs. For fifteen
hours each blistering day he tramped

make it worth about half of that
amount. If the Vein should widen and
become richer, of course,, the property
might be worth infinitely more than
is now suspected. If the- ledge should,
grow thin â¢ and barren, then a great
loss would be experienced. Develop
ment is the only thing that will tell
the story and Taylor and his associates
mean to develop on a large scale. In
one or two places in sight assays have
run as high as $200 and $300. but the
general value of the rock is much less
than this. The greatest depth thus far
obtained, on the Jumbo is about 250
feet. The ledge seems to maintain its
width of ten feet all the way." The
owners do not expect to be able to
get any further dividends for "six
months at least and possibly a year
on account of the immense outlay pro
jected and the time that must neces
sarily elapse before the actual extrac
tion of ore can proceed. Water and
fuel are both expensive, the latter par
ticularly so. The only vegetation in
the vicinity is greasewood and sage
brush and this sort of.stuff cannot be
used for fuel. Since the original in
corporation the board of directors has
been changed. It is now composed of
C. D. Taylor, H.. L. Taylor, C. P. Holt,
C. F. Booth and T. S. Robinson. These
men are. all in harmony and will not let
any factional strife interfere with the
future working of the mine, asall
realize that their prospects of pros
perity are based on a proper handling
of the business. There have. been nu
merous quarrels in the past as to the
proper methods of transacting the
business connected with the immense
property and these disagreements have
cost thousands of dollars and interfered
seriously with the proper administra
tion of affairs. Profiting by these les
sons, the owners will steer clear of
litigation in ' the years to come. The

earth and with careful handling it may
turn out 'much more than it alreadyThe General claim, which is j one J

The Mary claim, the most southerly

It is always hazardous to estimate
the quantity and values contained in a

the Douglass properties which place the
figures at $12,000,000 are certainly con

500 feet depth of the main veins only,
and, to be still conservative, the veln3
were estimated at an average -of -two
feet in width and '. the ore at $10 per

returned an . average of $20 per ton,
while the tailings show an average of

milling of ores, namely water and fuel,
are at hand.

In November of last year the Tono
pah Railroad Company was notified by
the Southern Pacific Company that it
would at once begin to broad gauge its
C. and C. line from Moundhouse to
Sodaville and that this work would be
completed in three months. The Tono
pah Company had just placed an order
for three new narrow gauge engines,
and this order was canceled. On ac
count of the freight blockade which,
occurred on the C. and C. early In the
winter, the Southern Pacific Company
was unable to carry out its plans with
in the time specified, and it will prob
ably be ninety, days more before tho
C. and C. is broad gauged to Sodaville.
In the meantime the Tonopah Railroad
Company has been broadening its
grade and placing broad gauge ties
under the rails 'of Its line from Soda
ville to Tonopah. Thi3 work Is now
practically done, and by the time the;
broad gauging of the C. and C. is com
pleted to its junction point with tho
Tonopah railroad, the latter will be
ready to spread its rails, and tho work
can be accomplished in twenty-four
hours. The Tonopah Railroad Com
pany has nine broad gauge engines
lying, at Sparks ready for Bet vice.
Three of these engines belong to' thÂ«
Goldfield extension, which is now
graded to within five miles of Gold
field. If the rails and other 'material
are delivered promptly, the Goldfield
line will be ready to handle business
by the time the Tonopah railroad la
broad gauged to Tonopah,
At the present time a passenger trahx
Is run each way dally between Soda
ville and Tonopah. and three freight
trains, consisting of about twelve cars.
are run each way every day. Tho
freight traffic from Sodavde Is about
10,000 tons a month, and no "empties'*
are sent back, all cars beiny loaded with
ore. About 70 per cent of the Incoming
freight goes to the soutlrsrard by mule
teams for Goldfleld. Bullfrog and the
other camps now springing up all over
Southwestern Nevada. The equipment
of the broad gauge road ' will be tho
equal of that of any railroad in the
country. A through Pullman sleeper
will be run from Oakland to Tonopah
and Goldfield. The broad gauge will
handle four times the amount of , traffic
now handled by the narrow gauss and
the country win furnish It.
tributary to Tonopah have changed all
this, and instead of handling only
about 2000 tons of ore a month and
about twenty passengers a day each,
way. the road is now hauling out of
Tonopah between 8000 and 10,000 ton 3
of ore a month, and during the past six
months has carried about 150 passen
gers a day and handled nearly 4000
pieces of baggage a 'month. At the
outset one passenger coach was con
sidered sufficient for the business, but
when the road was completed* it was
found necessary to purchase two more
coaches, and shortly afterward two
sleepers were added to the passenger
equipment. Four more engines were
also found necessary, and the road i 3
now equipped with nine. The business
has grown so rapidly that the road
has been forced to Increase its facili
ties, in equipment, sidings and ter
minals, threefold over what it was at
first thought would be necessary.
This road \was built as a narrow
gauge from necessity, owing to the fact
that, the "connecting Hne^was a narrow
gauge road. The Tonopah road is
thoroughly \u25a0 equipped in ; every way for
rapid and safe handling^of freight, and
the road â¢ enjoys an . enormous business,
one that. itimay .truthfully be stated Is
much-larger : than J any : other road of
the same mileage in the world. The
road -was built by the Tonopah Mining
Company for.the purpose of hauling its
owniores-out of Tonopah. r In buying
the; equipment and preparing. for busi
ness,* 1 * the plan was based on conditions
as they existed two years ago. At that
time * there were na^ outlying camps
as -there ; are now, and it .was thought
that the road would not be required
to "\ handle m ore . than 25.000 tons of ore
a year, and that principally from the
Tonopah, -Minings Company's ; mines.

Mr. Tripp, under whose direction the
Tonopah railroad was so quickly and
completely constructed, was born in
Kennebunk, Me, in 1839. -The son of
parents who tilled the soil, he received
tvhat little education he could gather
from the district schools of the county
In which he. was' born. At the early
Jige of 13 he left home to /battle with
the big. world. Thrown upon his own
resources, \u25a0 he '; went to where
he went to work for the Boston _ and
Maine railroad' and. learned the art of
railroad telegraphy, in which he be
came-an adept. "He was among the
first to learn ;the profession, and with
Robert Pitcairn, Andrew. Carnegie and
other noted, men. formed the first
telegraphers' union. In 1861. attracted
by the oil excitement, he went to Pitts
burg, .where he accepted a position as
clerk for the Aladdin Oil Company. Oil
was then' a manufactured product, and
when the natural petroleum was dis
covered, he .was made manager of the
same company. Receiving a most in
viting .offer to enter, railroad work, he
resigned his position with the oil com
pany and went with. the, 1 Allegheny
railroad in the freight and passenger
department, and when he resigned to
go with the Baltimore and Ohio rail
road s in 1882, he .was general <yardmas
ter of: the company. He was general
yardmaster for the Baltimore and Ohio
until 1890,' when" he went .with the'
Charlestown. /Cincinnati and Chicago
railroad. When the , road was absorbed
by the Southern he. was made general
superintendent of terminals, with head
quarters at Jacksonville. Fla. He re
mained with this company until Octo
ber, 1903, when he accepted the high
and responsible position of general su
perintendent ; of : construction and gen
eral freight and passenger agent of the
Tonopah railroad. _
In reviewing- the prominent men who
have so materially assisted in making
Tonopah and the entire gold producing
district of Southern Nevada the great
and promising* country, it is The
Call's desire in this" comprehensive re
view to give due space and " adequate
mention to a gentleman who has mate
rially assisted in this grand result.
The discovery of gold in Tonopah
naturally attracted to this section of.
the country hundreds of. mining men
and prospectors. These swarthy argo
nauts were at once confronted with
the momentous problem of transporta
tion, for Tonopah was sixty miles from
the nearest and, in" fact, only railroad
by which" transportation facilities were
available. Necessity, of course, is the
mother of invention,- and as, the camp
grew and the mines began to develop,
the old means of transporting freight
by stage and wagon was found to be
inadequate, and a railroad running' di
rectly into the camp was found ; to . be
a necessity. Capital was cecured and
a company formed to construct a road
from Sodaville to connect with the Car
son and Colorado road at that point.
The first ! important , consideration waa
the .selection,Â©! a manager and super
intendent to take charge of the con
struction work. " The people were in a
hurry for the road to get into Tono
pah, in order that provisions might be
obtained .and the precious metal ship
ped out, so that : it was necessary to
secure for that important position a
man who could not* only build a rail
road in the least possible time, but
one, as well, who could consruct a
road on the most Improved plan" for
safety, etc.
. Naturally, there were a ' number of
men available, but the directors wisely
selected Alonzo Tripp, a man of years
of experience in the railroad service in
all departments and a man thoroughly
versed in all the manifold' details nec
essary to the proper construction and
equipment of the road. To say that
the directors chose wisely is verified
by the fact that just exactly four
months after the first shovelful of
earth was thrown but the last and,
by the way, a golden spike was driven
in the last tie ; of the new road.' and
thus Tonopah was placed in direct
communication with the markets of the
world. This- feat was i commented on
by nearly all of the leading railroad
journals of the world as being a re
markable example of railroad construc
tion. ,
The officers^and principal owners of
the Van Duzcr-Douglass Mining Com
pany are Congressman C D. Van Du

Tonopah Mining and , Investment- Com
pany, of which Congressman CD. -Van
Duzer is president,' P. E. Van Duzer
secretary and John B. Ackerman gen
eral manager, is a developed mine and
a producer, it having produced $100,000.
A depth of 400 feet has been reached
Water and fuel are available in suf
ficient cuantities.
A very prominent mining engineer,
after making an examination of the
property, stated that it was capable of
working 100 men for, 100 years with a
100-stamp mill.
The company has but recently ac
quired this valuable property. Con
tracts have been let for a large hotel
and office bunding; to be constructed at
the mines, and as soon as completed
the working force will be increased to
about twenty miners.
A 700-foot triple compartment shaft
Is to be started at once, with -a hoist
capable of sinking 1000 feet, while
later on a fifty-stamp mill will be
erected, with accommodations for 100
stamps. . â¢ - -â¢ -
According to the United States Mint
receipts $300,000 has been taken out
on this property since its discovery in
1893. While the amount extracted was
large in the aggregate, the work hav
ing been done largely by individuals
and with no capital or concerted ef
fort,'was sufficiently simply tb dem
onstrate the large ore bodies, many of
the veins being merely scratched over.
The property has. been looked upon
as one of great promise. '. ; ..
Within eig,ht miles, the Garfield Min
ing Company produced $8,000,000. The
Van Duzer-Douglass Company has at
present a five-stamp mill on the j ground,
which is used to make small runs of
ore from 100 to 200. tons.
The ores of this district resemble
those of the celebrated mine at Bodie,
Cal.. and are generally of a soft de
composed quartz, yielding readily to
free milling plates and amalgamation
process, the cheapest method of ore re'
duetion. The gold is free and consid
ered very fine. This company has about
$60,000 worth of tailings which are to
be treated by the cyanide process.
In July, 1904, the section was visited
by a terrific cloudburst that did con
siderable damage to the workings of
the property. Several hidden ledges
were laid bare and recently a few of
them have been opened up to a^depth
of from four to six feet from the sur
face with remarkable showing, assays
from samples taken running from $21'
to $175, nearly all of the values, being
in gold. Ten samples, from varioufj
portions of one new ledge averaged
$65 in gold and $3 in silver. It is es
timated that at least $10,000,000 can be
extracted from this group of mines.
The Van Duzer-Douglass group com
prises a series of gold bearing quartz
ledges, with a general parallelism run
ning nearly east and west. The ledges
vary from two to fifteen feet in width.
The topography of the property and
development of the veins are such that
a very accurate knowledge as to quan
tity of ores and the values can be ob
tained at a considerable depth. Sev
eral veins have been opened by shafts
and crosscuts to depths of , from 100 to
400 feet_ The same veins are clearly
defined on the surface and have been
â¢worked to various depths through the
property.
Esmeralda County borders the eastern
slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains
and is attracting general attention in
the mining world of to-day. \ The moun
tain ranges are thoroughly impregnated
with mineral deposits. Its prominence
as a mining section was first reached
through Aurora, which produced many
millions. It was followed by the rise of
Candelaria, a- camp that in the. early
'SOs added about $60,000,000 to the stock
of precious metals.
Sodaville, in Esmeralda County on the
Carson and Colorado division of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, is the center
distributing and shipping point for one
of the richest mining districts in the
State. Connection is made with Tonopah
Railroad for \u25a0 Tonopah, Goldfield, and
Southern Nevada. Within five miles of
Sodaville on the northern slope of Mount
Messiah on the most eastern spur of the
Excelsior range, 7000 feet elevation, are
twenty-two claims, property of the Van
Duzer-Douglass Mining Company. This
group of mines is "on the spur of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains, near the cen
ter of the great California-Nevada zone
made famous by Bodie; the Pamlico and
Lapanta in Hawthorne district and Sil
ver Peak and by three
prominent features: First, output; sec
ond > high values; third, large ore bodies.
The output of this zone has been $200,
000,000. Its possibilities are unlimited;
float found by Robert Stewart of Soda
ville, near the Gem mine, which is about
2500 feet from the Van Duzer-Douglass
mines, represented a value of $200,000 per
ton.
Company has been under his guidance at
the mines.
The topography of the property and the
development of the. veins Is such that a
very accurate knowledge as to quantity,
of ores and the values can be obtained to
a depth of 1000 feet. Several veins have
been opened by shafts and crosscuts to
a depth of from 100 to 400 feet below the
level of the mill." These same veins are
clearly defined . on the ' surface and have
been worked to various depths as they
extended through the." property, 'reaching
elevations of from 500 to 1000 feet above
the mill and down the opposite "side, of
the mountain to about the same level.
This district was discovered in 1593 and
has been worked on a small scale by. leas-"
ers_ and. various , owners, . a number, of
whom took out snug fortunes, [ producing
in all about $400,000. â¢ ' \ v
While the sunount taken out was
large in the aggregate, the work hav
ing been done largely by individuals
and with no capital or concerted , ef
fort, was sufficient simply to demon
strate the" largo ore bodies, many of
the veins being simply, scratched over.

The" Van Duzer-Douglass properties
comprise a series of parallel gold-bearing
quartz veins, all holding a general east
erly and westerly course, with a slight
dip to the south. The ledges vary from
one to fourteen feet in width, the entire
group covering an area two miles in
length by three-quarters of a mile *in
width. A marked feature of all- these
series of veins .is their remarkable per
sistency in the deepest workings. , They are
traceable for a long, distance upon the
surface,- while the system of difyes which
parallel the veins are strong and well de
fined, and the veins, which are true fis
sures with the contact features, are in
closed in porphyry .and limestone walls,
the ore leaving the walls perfectly free. .
The ores are generally ' a - soft, decom

sulphides (pyrite) ; the gold jis j free and
quite fine, yielding > readily â¢ to the' free
milling process of battery, and plate amal
gamation, supplemented by cyanide treat

traction, is thus enabled. . - .
\u25a0 For years the surface of the numerous
leugeS 'was worked by leasers .by open
cuts, shafts, tunnels, etc., of limitedyex

from the pay /chutes, but the instances
are few where depths on the same pay

exposing ore bodies: carrying value 3
from $8 to $500 per ton, while in places
picked samples have assayed as high
as $1500. Considerable ore is stoped
ready to be knocked down and milled.
A careful measurement of ore- in sight
places it at $100,000.
The last three mill runs on ore from
this mine of 160, 150 and 100 tons net
ted, respectively, $5282, $3782 and $2000,
an average- of $32-50, $27 50 and $20
per ton. This company has about
$15,000 worth of tailings in reserve for
cynnidins'.

Company and the Van Duzer-Tonopah
Mining and Investment Company in

plant for getting the values out of the
tailings on the two properties.
The camp is beautifully located, and
known' as the Gold Range mining dis
trict, while the present postofF.ce name
is Douglass.
A telephone line connects the camp
\u25a0with Sodaville. ,
On the southern slope of the Ex
celsior range of mountains is a group
of eight claims, a portion of which
adjoins the Van Duzer-Douglass mines.
These are the property of E. Grassie
of Sodaville, Nov., and are at the pres
ent time bonded to Eastern capitalists.
Extensive ore deposits abound in this
property, and are the making of an
enormous mine, the character of oro
being the saiuo as in the Bounce and
Van Diizer-Douglass mines.-
The properties' of the Van Duzer-Doug
lass Mining Company are" located-., at
Douglass, Esmeralda County, State of
Nevada, on the most northerly slope of
the eastern spur of the Excelsior range
of mountains, about six miles in a-west
erly direction from Sodavilley a station
on the Carson , and Colorado Railroad, a
branch system of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company.
The properties comprise a group of
twenty-two claims, including fractional
claims.^or . a total of approximately 3CO
acres. The elevation at the mines is 7000
feet above sea level, .from which altitude
a magnificent view is obtainable for miles
of an extensive and valuable mining area.
This section, formerly known as the Sil

renewed lease of life, and a new mining
district has lately.- been formed and is
known as the Gold Range. mining- district,

Guide to the Latest Mining Districts
j THE SAN FRANCISCO; CALU, TUESDAY,' MAY" 23;- 1905:
FOR the guidance of all
who are interested in
the mining districts of
Southwestern Nevada, a
map, brought strictly up to
date, with the names of the
latest camps and their geo
graphical location accurate
ly defined, has been prepared
for this number and is pub
lished on this page. The ne
cessity for this is evident, as
no official maps of older
date supply the informa
tion that is demanded.

TO THE
MINESThe desert to the eye is a boundless
land of sunlit gray. When the spring
rains come, - giving a breath of life ; to
the dead-looking, endless ', sea of â¢ sage
brush, the color, changes to a greenish
gray; but the summer; sun soon takes
away the emerald hue. , Here and there
win be rarely found a blotch of red'or
yellow; or brown; rocks, : or dark shad
ows, like a bright-colored -hat in- a

To the great, majority, of men. .the
desert Is supposed to -be a wholly, un
known region. To the geologist it is
not so. Powell, Gilbert, Marvin, Rowe,
Weeks, Hague, Emmons and Spurr of,
the United States Geological Survey
have written about various parts of it
till It 'is no longer a mystery land,
though it is far from having been stud
ied in detail. From these writers the
leading geological features can be
learned. From another , crop of pro
fessors, now abundant \u25a0 on the desert,
who can name an eruptlverock after
one glance, or tell that a certain char
acter of ore proves the permanency . of
an ore deposit, .; one can learn 'some
other things, though it is questionable
whether 'the knowledge is not subject
to the Josh Billings criticism, "It is bet
ter : not to know so many things than
to know so. many things that ain't so."
Bullfrog Is located in Nye 'County,
Nevada, in that blank space on 'most
maps which Is marked "Amargosa Des
ert." It lies on the eastern side of the
Grapevine Range, which forms a part
of the eastern boundary of Death Val
ley, the horror region about which ro
mance has woven many ,tales of lost
mines and truth has told many a ter 7
rible story of human suffering, insan
ity arid death. â¢ ; â¢\u25a0
The storm center of mining Interest
in the United States is the Nevada
desert. This may be designated gen
erally as that, part of Eastern Nevada
lying south of the. thirty-ninth parallel.
The desert, however, continues south
ward into California to the Mexican
border without any material change in
topography or character, and the ore
veins and deposits are not confined to
Nevada.
The central point of ' interest has
moved in a : couple of years south from
Tc-nopah, 27. miles to Goldfield, and
again farther south, 70 miles to
Bullfrog, where it is at the present
time. It is not likely to remain there
many months, as there are other por
tions of the desert. where rich mines
may be found, and in their turn be
come the center of attraction.

These ranges are geologically young.'
The>' emerged . from the waters ages
after" the time when the' Sierra peaks :
were islands -in the. young'/ world's
ocean. At the time, or soon after they,
were elevated from .the waters, there
came a ffreat overflow of lava, now
classed as andesite or rhyolite, and
after, other ages there came another
overflow of rhyollte or "malpai," each
covering much of Nevada. Those were
times when this earth .shell was
cracked, and heaved and folded; when
great .masses of half. -fused rock filled
cracks, forming what we know as
dikes, or broke out in masses that
formed hills; great hot springs boiled
up and their silica-laden waters
formed veins or mountains of quartz.
The cambrlan, silurlan, devonian, car
boniferous and triassic were tilted up
and can bo' seen on the flanks of the
ranges now. Conglomerates, quartz-
Ites and limestone are the .old sedi
mentary rocks generally seen. . Lead
and silver ores are found In the.lime
stone, while the'gold-bearing veins are
mostly in the old andesites and rhyo
lites. There is scarcely any known
variety of ore not found on the dessert.
All the world knows of its great gold
deposits, but the ores it possesses
which" the world does not yet know
are important. Copper, lead, silver,
antimony, tungsten, cinnabar" arid
molybdenum I have seen in proven good
deposits or promising prospects. JCoal
has' not yetbeen. found in considerable
quantity. In fact the cretaceous, in
which the principal coal deposits, of
the West are found, is, so: far: as : I
know, lacking in Nevada. 'Thin seams
of coal are found in carboniferous
strata, in the Monte Christo and other
ranges,, but have not , developed into
anything of lmportacne. â¢ Several out- v
crops of coal are also found at Coal
dale, on the line of the Tonopah Rail-:
road, in Esmeralda County,. but; their
value .: is problematical. .; | One . sample
that I received from there gave results
as follows: Volatile under 250 degrees,
16 per cent; volatile at white heat,
30.14 per cent; -fixed carbon, 28.15 per.
cent; ash, ,25 per cent , While this Is
poor, it is the best found in Nevada.
The GrapevineV and Funeral ranges
are attracting, a great amount of at
tention, and they richly warrant it.
These two ranges are practically one.
North of Furnace Creek it is known as
Grapevine ' and south as '> Funeral. The
latter,.' gets Its . name from the dark,
somber, dreary, ; death-suggesting
rocks', of which .it ,1s largely com
posed: Their summits are about 5000
feet above sea level. On their west
ern side, descending to Death Valley,
they are steep and cut with rather
rough canyons. On. the eastern side a
long escarpment "generally /stretches
away to the ,valley. These escarpments
are { a i noticeably peculiar, feature \u25a0 all
over, the desert. They are almost uni
versally found si oping away from, the
base of the ranges, and in many places
veins of ore are covered; by them."* ln
no place have; Ii ever seen a moraine
or other evidence of glaciers. ; Funeral
Range , is mostly i : composed of ; sedi
mentary rocks, \u25a0â capped ; by. basic lavas.
.Some of the old i long known,- and
almost or -quite deserted camps are
feeling the revival and showing an un
suspected'wealth "of ore.- This- is
noticeably , true of ;Tule Canyon, Lida
Valley, Silver Peak and Liberty. : The
latter was deserted for; years. - It 'was

The desert is peculiarly characterized
by low, parallel ranges of . mountains,
having a general north and south
course and separated by valleys from
ten to forty miles wide. These continue
with some degree of regularity as far
south as the Atchison, . Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad in California. South
of that thÂ« valleys and ranges are not
so well defined. At their northern ends
they have an approximate elevation of
7000 to 8000 feet, falling gradually to an
altitude of 4000 feet or less in the most
southern part of Nevada.

\u25a0In the feverish. haste to get^ there it
is well to remember that all the good
things are not found first. "While aa
a rule it is better to. take time by the
forelock than to hang on by the tail,
there are exceptions to it. They are
discovering good ore in Greece, where
mining has been .followed since 500
years before Christ, and where De
mosthenes was an attorney in the first
mining lawsuit recorded by j history.
The business end of mining was the
same there that . it is now. Business
consists- in trying to get what other
people own. , ,
The present year, nor next year, nor
many, a'yearto come, will end pros
pecting chances in Nevada. Nor can
one predict the probable location of the
richest or. best things to be discovered.
AH we know isjthat ore is found al
most everywhere on the desert'
Every, one..ls now. looking for very
rich stuff. -The. rock containing, s3o or
less per ton Ib ; treated .with contempt.'
At, present this grade of ore, in most
d_^r^ regions, has no value} owing to,,
vmiavorable economic surroundings.
These are distance from commercial
points and consequent cost of Bupplles
and, cost of marketing ore, the lack of
wood or ; other, fuel, and of water for
milling purposes. But conditions #are
changing/ bo that in a short
time they will be entirely different and
many of the . now despised low-grade
ores will, contribute largely, to general
prosperity. The" rapidly building rail
roads will -furnish crude oil. from Cali
fornia or coal from Utah, thus solving
the j transportation and fuel problems.
./The water . problem is not a serious
one.; 'There" Is \ not a valley in Nevada
where ' there is not an underground
water supply.' Wells will find it at
depths .varying from- ten to three* or
four hundred fefet.'.'and in; many, of the
valleys the. geological conditions [' are
favorable for obtaining. artesian water.
The -valleys : are underlaid with sedi

northern r ends are . springs and
creeks : which 'run Â« but short distances,

the fountain head. . v It needs no prophet

The present year will doubtless see
many rich discoveries on the desert.
Most of the things which 'a .horseback
.prospector will v iirid -may be- located,
but it i? safe to say that many, of them
will wait .years h for .their .value .ta
be, discovered, as the great Jumbo did
at' Goldflold.i Its quartz outcrop, stood
above the 'ground. Many a; prospector
in past -.years, put a locution notice on
it, â¢ broke' 6ft â¢ quartz* had -it . tested,
round < it .-to* be .worthless and never-re
turned to it. The-. next wandering ore
hunter did the same. Finally a man
tookspme of. the yellowish, decompos
ed part of the vein, and immediately
the world "had rainbow colors for him."
The despised dirt was the valuable ore,
worth thousaiids of dollars per ton.
Sbmehpw It is '-human, nature, crop
ping out in-- the prospector, as it, does
in all the race, to be blind to the good
close by. The* sunshines brighter and
the shade is cooler on the distant hill
than it is near, at hand. ;
Rich ore, standing above the ground,
has been passed by for a generation,
waiting for some one to recognize it.
The good things in a mineral way may
not be old acquaintances. The pros
pector, who has only sneers for a the
orist, but is . himself a most abject
blave <5f theory â the theory that he
cau tell gd*od ore from its looks â often
passes by a fortune., Many a one did
at Tonopah. The veins which Butler
discovered and which started all the
desert excitement, had been seen by
many another prospector before But
ler found them. , Mr.. Vollmer, an aa
sayer at Silver ; Peak, tells v * me that
years ago he made assays of
ore \ from the Tonopah- veins
which were "brought to hlm\ by
prospectors, but nonÂ« of . them
carried much value. The reason was
because the prospectors took for assay
poor ore, rejecting the good because it
looked like a black and white "quartz,
which is generally worthless. Even the
assayer. to whom Bugler took the
Tonopah ore first declined to' assay
it because it. looked to-be barren. 'â¢"\u25a0_\u25a0

The company " has constructed &
power line for a distance of ninety-four
miles from Bishop t Creek to Tonopah
and seven miles from Tonopah Junction
to Goldtield. It Is their Intention soon
to put in a duplicate line. When com
pleted the company will be able to fur

lighting an extent of country equal to
107 miles of mining territory and four
good-sized towns with an abundance
of water power to spare for future
exigencies to come for the next decado
of rapid development.
-The -nun associated with- Colonel
Rickey in this enterprise are all
wealthy mining men. who have Invest
ed quite heavily In the Tonopah, QoZd

Probably as a banker. Colonel Rickey
excells, for there Is no man In Nevada
who can show the colonel that he Is do
ing things and requires from Â£0.000 to
(100,000 to put his best efforts into sub
stantial execution that cannot obtain- the
amount required on call. It Is upon
these lines Colonel Rickey has been
largely .'â¢ Instrumental in . the rapid de
velopment of the new mining: fleld3 of
Nevada, through his foresight and
strong ,falth in human nature In comim?
to. the financial assistance of mining
operators with his good judgment and
moneyed support.
". Colonel Rickey Is president of thÂ«
State Bank and Trust' Company of CaÂ»

at Tonopah and an 'agency at- Goldtield.
He Is a 'large stockholder in the best

he knows the strain of cattle so â¢well
which he raises that, he is able to tell
any animal he owns, by. simply, seeing
the face. ' Once, pnl a i wager, several
cattle '\u25a0} belonging 1 ,to different \ people

. Most of those who early" became conr
spicuous -as Judges -and', lawyers "went
to N>yada ; , unheralded. They j were all
young-tv'and, untried., men at home and
had neither personal influence nor
family connections to help them ; >Â»s^
business ; , successes.*' , They depended
solely on their -own resources and the
strife, for success: hinged on' ,t n(S BU f"
vival\of, the .fittest.'. The fittest "man
was the most successful. .The most suc
cessful' Judge was- the one who dispensed
even-handed 'justice.' . i
As in all :inininff States .\'a..-. sense of
justice was the predominating pcnti
ment of nil the, men, and if the people
could not secure justice through the
courts they got; it by means of a rope.
The admission of the State of .Ne
vada Into the Union was a most excep
tional occurrence, 1 - coming as it aid at
the closo of the -Civil- War. \u25a0 Under the
Territorial Government, many of the
existing- laws and customs pertaining
to mines and mining claims were in
herited from Mexico, and thus at the or
ganization of tSie State they took a lons
step toward combining the best of
the legral products of the Old 'World,
with the progressive spirit of the New
World. - '-: '?: ' .'<"
To enumerate all the distinguished
characters who at an early day formed
the nucleus of a bar.second to none in
any other State in the Union, would be
beyond the limits of this article. ||
\u25a0 Of those living who were among the
first to cast their, lot with, the 1 new
State, William. H.Beatty,' Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of California, lirst
became identified with the judiciary.
Judge Beatty served on the first, bench
of .the Eighth Judicial District Ifrom
18 G4 to 1575. at which time his legal
attainments were well proved. He. was
elevation to the Supreme bench, and dur
ing . the years of 1879 and ISSO was its
Chief Justice. After his term of office
expired he moved to California, and in
ISB9 was honored with the appointment
of Chief Justice, of the Supreme Court
of California to fill the unexpjred term
of Chief Justice Morrison. He* ha 3 been
re-elected twice to this position.
As. the most illustrious advocate of
the a,blest bar any Western State has
produced, ""it Is clearly manifest this
distinction belongs to Judge John Gar
ber. .He early became recognized for
his- profound, learning, his indomitable
industry and his high conception of
fight and wrong, and his.magnhicent
presence soon won for. him a place In
the Supreme Court, of which he was a
member from 1371 to .November 1872.
He then resigned and moved to Cali
fornia, where he. is now known as the
nestor of that . bar.
Nevada was particularly fortunate in
the judiciary, who, from necessity be
came builders of the State. Not .hav
ing: any one â to. lean. upon, they were
self-reliant and the inventive genius of
tho hour gave to the' bench and bar a
wider scope and a more Varied ex
perience., which was necessary to flt
their - peculiar . conditions. v
To-day the most prominent and con
spicuous man on the bench In Nevada
is Judge Thomas P. Hawley. Unitea
States District Judge for. that district.
He is a man of- broao; - understanding and
rare and- varied learning- in ' the law.
Judge Hawley's service on the -bench
commenced in 1872, whenhe'was'clect
ed Associate Justice of '.the Supreme
Court. He was re T elected at- each suc
ceedinff election until' he resigned from
that high office' in September, IS9O, to
accept the 'position* he n6w" hpld&". to
.which he ,wus appointed by President
Harrison. ' ;
The position of United siates District
Attorney is 'filled creditably by Sardia
Summerrteld of the Reno bar, who is
now holding the office for the seconn
term. ; Mr. Summcrfield for many years
has held a distinguished place^at the
bar and In^public life in Nevada.*

SOLVING A PROBLEM
one can tell. Professor Sparr puts it
this way: "The indications are not un
favorable to .the continuance of high
igrrade. or at. least good grade ores; to
a considerable depth. There is, how
ever, no continuous regularity to the
ore shoots, whether sulphide or oxi
dized. The streaks Increase, diminish
and disappear in the most unexpected
fashion.'*
period. ThoJ most common are rhyo
lites and andeaites and as nearly as
can be determined are of identical age
with those of Tonopah. . Another fact
which, proves < the mineral deposits of
these two . sections to be* of the: same
origin is this: mineralization Inboth
cases took place after the laval erup
tion.;, In both cases also the irregular
formation of the/iuartz beds shows the
action of hot. springs: but at Tonopah
the "fracture was stronger, resulting in
well denned veins, while at ' Ooldfleld
the .deposits are most Irregular. So
much so that it ia often, impossible to
tell ( the" gold-bearing- from the barren
quartz,. and' only after the ore has been
taken" out-is. the deposit found to have
a^ffeneral, channel shape. This maybe
only ono oc two feet. in width, while
the silicioup casing of barren quartz is
twenty 6r thirty; Pyrites exist, in much
of the quartz , tHat shows no gold and
must bethe result. of thciactiOn" of the
sulphur in the hot springs on the iron
silicate; of -the rocks through which
they passed. '\u25a0â¢.\u25a0 \u25a0:/ â¢\u0084â¢â¢..\u25a0
\u25a0: So rar' nearly; nil : the' ore found has
sbeen"5 been" oxidized, 'but the high. water :le'vel
shows that this can only, be temporary.
Still in some of J.he mines sulphide
ore has been found below the oxidized
zona almost as rich. The value of all
the ore Is remarkably high and sonvj
times almost Incredible; $200 and &J9
is the general average, but 917 pounds

An' there's always 'bout a hundred o' these gents a-joafin' 'round.

Till it looks as though the nation hasn't any .more to lend â
An' extended our extensions till there's nuthin' to* extend.)
One night a mine permoter from the mercenary East,
With his cheek all smoothly shaven like a Philadelphy priest,
Got into camp from Sody on a overloaded stage,
With his eyes inflamed an' rimy, an' a-smellih' strong o' sage;
An' they dumped him down at Stimler's, where he stomped arcÂ±un' an'
'Bout the blooiniri' arid' desert, while a-shakin' off the dust;
Then he turned an' tackled Stimler, savin' loudly, "I persume
That you got my application for a two-compartment room!"
Stimler pondered for a minute,, then he sort o' smiled an' said:
"You'll be mighty lucky, stranger, if you git a single bed!
I jest filed yer application, but I ain't got nary sweet,
An' the market ain't supplyin' us with very. much to eat;
But we've got a lot o' liquids that's as. good as you can findâ
Pervided you're a-climeted to our pertic-lar kind;
An' if you're feeling' frisky an' a hankerin' to bet,
We can furnish you with faro an' amuse you with roulette !"
Then a lot o' Mizpah leasers which was lingerin' aroun'
They 'allured the thirsty stranger for to go an' see the town,
An' they took him down to Brougher's, an' they showed him every
; sight - - â¢
An' pursood the local customs which controls the camp at night, V
An' when they got him sleepy an' suffishently confused,
They took him to a tunnel which was very seldom used.
An' they made the cuss a mattress out o' thousand-dollar ore,
An.t hey covered him with empty sacks an' left him there to snore.
Next afternoon this expert, when he 'got. Himself released,
Perpared a tecknicle report an' sent the same. back East. â¢ â¢ . '
He said : "A chap named Butler was a-monkeyin' aroun'
An' stumbled 'gainst a "chunk b' ore protrudin' from the groun', . *
An' jest, because it assayed high ah.l ooked uncommon fine,
He kind o' lost his head an' thought he'd found a payin' mine." ;^
Ari'thenhe closed his first report: "They'll work Her. -out by spring â
I spent a whole night underground an' couldn't see a thing!"
Next, day this here permoter.; was interrogatin' Jim, .* v-. \u25a0
With.a sort o' sneakin' notion .that he'd git the best o' him..
They was settin' down to Kendall's with a jug o' Holland, gin,
Which the same they .was imbibin' out b', glasses made o' tin,
I -When this' expert, sprung the. question, with; a wise look all aroun',
! "Are you cert'n, Mister Butler, that yer bloqmin' ledge goes down?* 7
Old Jim he, thought a second, while a^gazin' in his cup, -
Then he. answered sort o' sudden, "Well, by God! she don't, go up!'*
That night' he made his last reportâ this expert of renown,'
*'I find the Mizpah don't. go up an' therefore turn her down!"
Last month the news it got back Eastâ it was too good to keep-
That every mine in Tonopah is rich an' wide an' deep! /
When this permoter. heard the news, he went an' got in bed
An' tossed: an* groaned there for a week, an' then' they found him
, \u25a0; 'dead.
An' tHe Coroner's certificut is was consize an' briefâ
"The late lamented wasn't sickâ he simply died o' grief!"

RECLAMATION WILL BRING
PROSPERITY.
Henry Thurtell, State Engineer
To no other State in the Union can the
Congressional reclamation act of June, 17,
1902, bring bo large- a. measure of benefit
as to the Stale of Nevada.
This State/ third in; area, but , forty
fifth in population and wealth, has less
than 1 Der, cent eft the total area under
cultivation.' Great tracts of, land are so
broken try mountains or He so high -that
their cultivation now or ever is absolutely"
out of the question. These. lands are not
worthless, for they furnish feed for great
herds of cattle,, sheep and horses that
graze upon the wild herbs and grasses
that grow upon the mountain slopes. \u25a0
Other enormous tracts of - land are
deserts upon which ' can be not, a
vestige of vezetation; Here there is no
animal life, not even \u25a0 a \u25a0 lizard or a
horned toad. For centuries under the
biting winds of. winter and the parching
summer sun, â" these wastes : . have lain,
"shunned by man . and beast, dreary. In
hospitable, dreadful. .. To regions such as
these Government aid to Irrigation can
bring no chance. : Not all that wealth
can do or * science \u25a0: discover ' can ~~ make
these desert lands : fruitful or fit for the
habitation of : man. These may, aptly
be called the "Country' that God Forgot.?
But It is the valley landâ the land made
rlchOby the washings, of -the leaf mold
from the mountains through numberless
ages of time," to which the great Govern
ment ,act above mentioned- brings
promise. \u25a0 . .'\u25a0;\u25a0. . ". .. â¢ .-.'
The summer flow of the streams had
been nearly all appropriated prior; to
the passage of the act,; but \u25a0 the'' flood
waters of the principal k streams , have
heretofore been wasted. By the storage
of these flood waters "in great reservoirs
for use . during the summer season the
amount of valley land that can be irri
gated during the growing season will be
greatly increased. .

feet from one base ovur the summit: to
the other. The big ledge of this company
cuts through" the center, of the mountain
from the north to the south and may be
traced distinctly all along, the surface.
Its average width is eighty feet and the
average assays throughout . ' the Whole
width and throughout the ; entire length
of 3000 feet give values from $20 \u25a0 to ; over
$1000 per - ton. It is a conservative '; esti
mate to state that the entire ledge will
assay $20 a ton in gold. Taking the length
of --.the Â« ledge on the surface. Its width
and the height of the mountain j that : it
cuts, you can conservatively estimate
that there are 1,875,000 tons of ore in
sight," and there is every reason to be
lieve that the -ore continues down to a
great depth below the - base of the

Where the farmer has to seek a market
abroad, he receives the prices paid there
with the freight taken off. but where ho
has a home market, which ho cannot
quite supply, as Is the case In all the
mining countries he receives the market
price with the freight added. It is this
fact that has made the Nevada farmer
the most I rosperous and contented of his
class.
.Just now there Is talk of bÂ»t sugar
factories at Lovelock, on tha Hmnboldt
River, and In Carson Valley, near Gard
nerville. The Inauguration of these andT
kindred enterprises will enhance the
value of land immensely and the man
who makes his home in Xsvada now will
get all the benefits of the promised ad
vance.
There Is probably no place in this
country wbero land can bo bought to>
better advantage or on more favorable
terms.
Any single person over 21 years of age
or any head of a family, provided .they
have declared the Intention to become a
citizen of the United States, if not one
already p may take up a homestead with
no charge except land office fees.
In material Interests Nevada Is just
trembling on the rise and not in a thou
sand years will she offer the Inducements
to settlers that she does to-day. The lons
period of depression Is of the past, tha
future is assured.

Goldfleld mmmg '.fields, in which lie.
O'Brien has made both a reputation and
a handsome competency. :
; The capital of the Tonopah Banking
Corporation is iV $250,000,- all paid up, and
of John S. Cook& Co. $50,000, fully paid,
with deposits already amounting to up
ward of $000,000. ; S. H. Kitto, cashier of
the Nye and Ormsby County branch of
Goldfield, has resigned and it is under
stood that he will occupy an important
position in- the-new Tonopah Banking Cpr-
U.S. Senator. George S. Nixon, Senator
T.- L. Oddie, George Wingfield, Charles
Knox and associates have disposed of
their interests in, the Nye and Ormsby
County Bank of Carson City, "Tonopah
and .Goldfield. They, have formed the
Tonopah , Banking, Corporation of .Tono
pah, and have purchased apart interest
in the ' banking house of John S^ : Cook
& Co. of Goldfield -and Rhyolite, estab
lishinga new chain of banks in' the Ne
vada mining 'district's. V '
porat'on. Cashier Harris of the Farmers'
and. Merchants' Bank of Reno has re
s'gned t and will also go to Tonopah to
take an active part in the building up of
the business of the new corporation.
John S. Cook remains in complete
charge of the Goldfield and Rhyolite offi
ces of ' John S. Cook & Co. The directorate
of the new Tonopah Banking Corporation
has not yet been announced, but It is un
derstood â¢ that .United. States Senator
George S. Nixon will be at the head. The
Nye and Ormsby County Bank, during the
period when Sentitor Nixon and his
fiitnds held the controlling interest, had
upward of $2,000,000 on deposit, and it is
believed that the new Tonopah Banking
Corporation .will . start off with general
deposits of upward of $1,000,000. Senator
Nixon's, friends here and. in Tonopah an
nounce their intention of giving the new
Tonopah Banking Corporation a full share
of their business.
John S. Cook & Co. will move into the
new threÂ«rstory Nixon block ; on Main
street, Goidflold, which Is now rapidly
approaching completion. " This" will* bÂ« the
finest huiiiling in the State of- Nevada,
and will represent an investment of J55.000.
The Tonopah Banking Corporation will
move into the Broughtr building at Ton
opah.
It is announced that the following capi
talists, have taken over the Nlxon-Oddie-
Wlngfield interest In the Nye and Ormsby
County Bank: Frank Golden, John Mc-
Kane, Key , Pittman. . Alonzo Trtpp.. H, C.
Cutting. Lucien L.. Patrick, D. M. Ityan,
State Treasurer of Nevada: James Sween
ey, Attorney General; Morris Shelirie, di
rector of the Bank of Nevada of Reno,
and others.
Cashier Tur'riion of the Bank of Nevada
at Reno has been appointed cashier' of

CREATE BANKING CORPORATION
Orrasb7. Loss Meder will be cashier at
Tonopah, and George "W. Cowing at Car
son City. A. G. Raycraft will be general
cashier and will superintend the opera
tions at all three offices.
The withdrawal of Senator Nixon aud
his friends from the Nye and Ormsby is
looked upon as a business transaction
solely. It is believed that John McKane,
Frank Golden and others who have pur
chased tho withdrawing Interests will
supply the gap, and that the Nye pnd
Oimsby. A3 well as the new Tonopah
Banking Corporation and John S. Cook &
Co., have a great future before them.
AUTOMOBILE TIIAJrSPORTATIOJr.
The difficulties of travel and transpor
tation through the great desert country
of Nevada, which have always been a
serious drawback to its development,
have. quite recently been largely overcome
by the Introduction of the motor vehicle.
By this means three days of travel havo
been reduced to one. and a tedious, tire
some and dusty ride has been changed
into scmethin? akin to a pleasure Jaunt.
The' time between Tonopah and Goldfleld
has been shortened frcm 4*J to \Vt hours,
and between Goldfleld and Bullfrog from
a tedious ride of two days to a 5-hour
pleasure trip, and a prqportlonate change
has been effected upon the road between
Kawich and Tonopah. Suitable roads are
rapidly being pushed In all directions and
equipped with modern machines especial
ly built. to perform the strenuous task of
mountain climbing with that of crossing
the arid plains of sand, both of which
are unavoidable features In our environ
ment. To judge from past progress it
does not seem at all improbable that
within three month 3 the travelins man
may In a period of three or four days
visit all the Important camps.

that had a style of his own. Ed Oolnon
made his .first reputation on the "Com

he: never "took a beck trail," but stead
ily, forged abroad in his profession until
he became one of the leading, if not the
leading editorial writer on this coast.
George Cassidy is another of the old
time newspaper m<jn .who has 'finished
his work ond gone on to the world be

Among- the, living writers of to-day
who were baptized In the profession on

first place are Arthur McEwea. and
Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain). Both
of these gentlemen began their, news

This company already owns and operates the Mollie Malone group, the King Solomon group and Black Diamond group. As an investment this is destined to appreciate and become very valuable.
PROSPECTUS OF T HE CALIFORNIA-NEVA^ -' **
The Combination, the Sandstorm,
Kendall, January and Jumbo are famil-
iar names among the miners.
Together these fire have shipped some
(wo and one-half million dollars' worth
of ore. The lessees on the Jumbo alone
produced one and three-quarter mil-
lions in seven months' time.
The Kendall, In one of its first ship-
ments of fifteen tons, netted $85,000.
The Combination Company* made a" cash
payment of $5000, capitalized the com-
pany for $400,000, paid ten per cent div-
idends per month, have $200,000 in re-
serve fund, and paid the purchase price.
$75,000 â all this out. of the mine Itself
during the one year of Its history, and
almost exclusively. out of development
work. It Is now paying dividends of
twenty per cent per month on tho full
capital stock.
The Slmmerone was purchased for
$4000. Within a few days a four-fifths
interest was sold for $65,000, and to-
day, with almost no development work,
the owners have ore worth $20,000 per
ton.
One of Our Prospectors. "Who Started
Out March 14th for a Trip South.
To-day the name â -Goldfleld, Nevada
â stands above every other name on the
list of mining camps. Cripple Creek,
Colorado, Is famous the world over. It
took Cripple Creek four years to pro-
duce what Goldfleld has accomplished in
one year and six weeks. And the beauty
of It all is that the locator, the, pros-
pector and the lessee are the ones who
have produced these results and reaped
the benefits. â¢
Goldfield has appropriately been call-
ed " the poor man's camp."> The; mines
mentioned above have never been, sur-
passed, but to them a long list may be
added: Diamondfleld, with Its wonder-
ful Black Butte, a mountain of ore: the
QuartzJte. Vernal.* Daley, Apex." . Great
Bend, Goldfield-Tonopah and Tonopah
Club, then the Velvet, '-the Bed Top,
Florence, Portland, St. Ives, . Patrick,
L.one Star and Simmerone.
The fleld la almost unlimited and ad-
jacent districts are rapidly rtvlnjsc every
proof of their treat mineral wealth.
The secretary of the Xevada Chamber
of Commerce says:
"The first year of G-oldfleld's history
was practically finished December 1,
1904, though active development was
not begun until February. The show*
ing during this time is a grand total of
$3,658,000. When one considers that the
mines giving this enormous return are
only a few of the many mines of the
district, one may well wonder what the
next year will bring forth.
"The greatest surface pannings ever
made in any mining camp is the ~won-
derful record of this, the greatest min-
ing district ever known In the world's
history.
"FACTS TO BK CONSD3ERED.
"First â It is the greatest gold camp
ever discovered. . . ; :
"Second â It has produced more gold
In one year than Cripple Creek did in
three.
"Thirdâ lt Is located in a State rank-
Ing third in gold production, with ' a
great possibility of taking the first
place in 1905.
"Fourth â It, Is the. poor man's camp,
where millions of capital are not neces-
sary to take out the hidden treasure.
"Fifth â Mining can be done all the
year round, as the climate is fine, dry
and healthful. . . -' \u0084
"Sixth â Gfeat strikes are of daily oc-
currence, and may strike 'any man's'
mine 'any day,', wherefore stocks owned
in' any mine may be worth a fortune to-
morrow. '. ' -â¢ \u25a0 r
"The Goldfleld discussed above Is now
but a: small affair with what it prom-
ises to be. It is situated In the center
of a great mineral zone, -extending for
many miles on all sides, from the Corn-
stock on the north to the Amargosa
Valluy on the south. " There are a score
of good-paying mines idle to-day, only
awaiting capital and energy to yield
their golden stream. 9 From Mexico . we
hear of American capital pouring int to
take up and work low-grade mines -for
$8 and $10 per ton, while in Nevada
there are scores of mines running over
$15 per ' ton Idle for want of ..capital.
With the advent of Goldfleld much of
this will be changed, and this great
camp, being the richest producer of this
vast zone, will undoubtedly .oecome the
center, or base of operations.. To the
north,-, east, : south :. and \u25a0 -west new < and
promising camps are springing into be-
ing. Truly, the /name Is nomisnomer,
and , lucky, is . Nevada ' to ' have this new
jewel added to, her laurels." ~'3g9i&&fBi
aiajor.W. A; Btanton,:ina .report on
February 15, 1905Â» of needs of railroad
transportaion. of ore, ; etc.,' says: / }fl f ur-
t her .' mtnttf. after ' a . careful observation,
that at .the. preaent date .there are not
!esÂ» than 1,000.000 tons of ore lylntc on

r Thus It comes to be not as to a mat-
ter of the. mineral wealth, but how may
this be feecured with safety. . ,is
most needed to-day is the careful selec-
tion of properties of merit, and in do-
ing, this. that, persons .placing a: limited
amount of money may. secure. the same
advantage as the . Investor ; of , larger
capital. : ' . \u25a0' - \u25a0-. J
\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0 The greatest difficulty In all such un-
dertakings is careful, thorough: investi-
gation by persons,, followed
with persistent personal attention. It Is
therefore necessary to be on the ground
and to keep at It. \u25a0 . , . ." . "

Unlike most of the gold mining companies that have later turned out
to be producers or 000-prodocers m Goldfield and its immediate vicinity,
the Hearst-Jaggers group of mining claims can be said to be a developed
network of gold mitres before the company itself has spent a dollar on de-
velopment work. . .
The locator of these claims, Tom Jaggers, from whom the .property
was purchased, is an old mining prospector of forty years' experience. He
has located other claims and developed them into mines before selling, and
belongs to that old school of prospectors who have known no other means
of disposing of a mining propeilj than by developing it and by'the sink-
ing of shafts, the carving oat of rntmels and the blocking bnt -of ledges,
demonstrating to the pore baser the existence of ore bodies sufficient to
make a paying mine.- ;
The Hearst-Jaggers property stands out as one of the few that at its
inception has guaranteed immense deposits of gold-prodncing ore. In this
class is the great Combination mine of Goldfield, which is paypg dividends
at the- rate of 5960,000 pcx year. Before that property : was tnrneVl over
by Laden L. Patrick to the company which is now farther developing
it shafts had been sunk and shipping ore had been blocked out. The
same may be said of the great Florence mine^of Goldfield; oat of which'
thousands of tons of ore are being Â»alrWn Â©ot now before a iromp^ny frai
been organized to take it over. - >.
THE STORY Of THE HEARST-JAGCERS.
The HeaTst-Jaggers Gold Mrmng' Company falm its tame -fcoai the
locator of the property, Tom Jaggers, aad from the W. R. Hearst daim
in the center of the grotrp, so named by Mt Jaggers when he located the
same three years ago.
The property is situated 33 miles sonthtrest of Goldfield, in Tttfc
Canyon. It consists of seven full mining claims, or 140 acres.
*â¢ The claims are named as follows: W. R. Hearst, Polar Sbtt; I Vkoex
.View, Crescent, Last Loaf, Stray Horse. and Leopard- - v
Tom Jaggers, the discoverer, ' after an ardaons career in the- early -nria-
xngdays of Colorado,, in which, he profited- to -the^extent, of ; $aoo/xo Jon
mining claims he had located, went to Ntvr^Mexico, and there he worked
a little gold claim, for several years, and also a pretty good silver property.'.
â¢He disposed of them and went to Arizona, from whence he traveled to
California over the mountains, and then went to Nevada. In 1895 ; he* had
been prospecting at Hawthorn, , Nev., when rhe struck a southern - trail. A
burro and the usual prospector's outfit was all he packed. He. was looking:
for good claims. After he had traversed over 100 miles,\ in which' he
spent, seven months, and had prospected thoroughly /every: inch of the
ground on the road, he located a silver property '\u25a0.'. in Tale \u25a0= Canyon, now
known as the Tom Jaggers Tule Canyon mine.. This he -"gophered"; for; ten
years, and, unaided by any living soul, took bnt \u25a0 $30,000. 0f shipping ore.
Between times he prospected, in . the district and located the Hearst ; group,
now possessed by the Hearst-Jaggers Gold Mining Company/
THE MINE OF HIS Llpfc
*ln all my prospecting," says Mr. Jaggers, '"I never raw atiyfluag-more
favorable in; the .way of mineral deposits 1 than there r is in Tule % Canyon. :
Never in my life have Iseen such favorable : showings. \u25a0 Capital alone has
been needed_ toTmake it a^ wonderful 'camp.* : The \u25a0country ; is > highly , rmp^r-
alized for miles on each^ side, and, in my opinion,"/ development .work will
show greater ore; deposits in that section than 'in. the immediate vicraity of
the town of Goldfield.
"When I located these, claims \u25a0thepropertyhadevidently beendesert-
led by- neophytes, who ( had commenced development work and i discontinued
for want of facilities. At that time the " nearest railroad station was l 108
nrilesaway, and; unless every; pound of; ore taken from the 'mine -assayed
$250 to the. ton the developerxould not afford to ship it.
"A cross-cut tunnel was run in "about 50 feet on the W. R. Hearst
claim, cutting a vein at the face o| the tunnel. Another little tunnel 'was
run in on the lead about" 30 feet* and gave evidence that some rich ore
had been taken out. A perpendicular, shaft, separate from the tunnel, was
sunk 50 feet through the country.rock to strike; the r lead. Evidently the
mine had been'\worked about eleven. or twelve, years priori;-
"The expense of movingore to the shipping point, at. that, time was; at
least $60 per ton for drayage ; alone. â¢ Mostof theore taken out was prob-
ably milled at a point 60 miles away by an old-fashioned w'ater~arrastra,
the most primitive method known for handling ore.
'Tor purpose oftest I went toiwork and built myself a little horse
arrastra, capacity one-third of a ton. Then/ Ii drifted at the'face of the
tunnel, on; the south: side: at .'a,- depth of about 60V feet from the surface.
The first blast that I put in at this spot revealed a vein at;least six feet
wide, .that . arrastraed ; $108 ': per ton in gold, v I also ; arrastraed .tailings that
had been ' left : on. the -dumps by. the former. prospectors,' and these'assayed â¢
$18 per ; ton. In all probability the man or men : who had : worked the
mine did so without even an assaying outfit accompanying., v ,
\u25a0^\*Smce then' I have oe^loped the" property asfoljows: I have rtm
drifts and raises from the face of the tunnel upward ; and longways, with
the lead, and'l: have; found- gold all; the way for. a -distance \u25a0\u25a0: of 150 feet
upward and 50 feet southerly, which shows the presence of immense ore

At an exp.ense :of $6000 this property can be 'developed np to a point
where a mill. can be considered, and the directors of the company have
decided that the first $6060 realized from the sale of stock shall be so em-
ployed. Work has. already commenced and the shaft will be strnk 300 feet;
infother words, 250 feet deeper than the present shaft. When that has
been accomplished a cross-cut tunnel will be* run from the bottom of the
300-foot shaft, in a westerly direction, to cross-cut- all the veins of this
group;' except the Crescent. This prospecting will show np the true ex-
tent" of the immense deposits. Drifts will be ran on the lead, and then
calculations will be made correctly as to the amount of ore tonnage and
the size of the mill that will be necessary to reduce the ore. .
A SHORT OFFERING.
The directors have authorized the sale by the company's fiscal agents,
L. Bleakmore Company, of. 100,000 shares at /15 cents per share. The pro-
ceeds will be used for development purposes. Half of these shares are
already, spoken for, andit is not believed that much time will elapse be-
fore the entire allotment will be fully subscribed. Unless all signs fail
- this stock will be worth par within a year, and as. soon as the first batch
of treasury stock offered has been taken np by the public the price will
v double. '.-. 'â¢ . - ;\u25a0; \u25a0 .'.. â '
If it is 'found necessary* to issue any more treasnry stock for derelop-
ment purposes the price will be advanced to at least double the present
rate, and probably much higher. .
The company gives this guarantee: If at any time m. the future it
becomes necessary to raise funds for the further development of the prop-
erty, the offer will not be made except at double the present .figure.
DIRECTORATE OF FAMOUS MINING MEN.
, George Wingfield, president, is associated with United States Senator
George S. Nixon of in nearly all of Mr. Nixon's mining ventures
in this country. Mr., Nixon himself is one of the most extensive mining
operators in Nevada. Mr. Wingfield has over $1,000,000 in the
past three years by getting in on the "ground floor" of half a dozen Ton-
opah and" Goldfield mining enterprises that have made good. His acquain-
tance with mining men is of the widest range, and his success is due en- â¢
tircly to;his ability to Judge values.
W., J. Douglass, vice president, is a far-famed mining engmeer. He
became one of the original owners of >the now- famous Montana Tonopah.
mine when it.was nothing'more than a sandy stretch of desert, and gave
"no-surface indications of ever becoming a great mine. Mr. Douglass'
opinion that on account of its geographical position it would, at a level
of:soo ; feet, show immense ore bodies akin to the great Tonopah mine,
vwhich owns the Mizpah. ledge, has been vindicated, and stock in the
:-* company, which 'was originally sold for development purposes at 30 cents
and. ; 5o cents per.!share, is now quoted at $3.00. Mr. Douglass, in addition
vto being a: director, in the Montana Tonopah, is also an officer in half a
dozen other great Tonopah and Goldfield mining companies, and is . the
J: superintendent 1 of the only ore reduction \u25a0 mill in Tonopah, ; m < which he is
"part owner..; He was also one of the original owners. of the Tonopah Mid-
way, whichj has - also materialized into a great gold producing mine. De-
velopment stock : in the Tonopah Midway was marketed at a sfiorter price
than that; of the- Montana Tonopah' and is to-day, selling around $1.25.
iy .John S. Cook, treasurer, is ithe senior member of the firm of John
S.CookV& Co., bankers, the leading banking house of Goldfield, which is
incorporated .with "-a paid-up capital of $50,000.. The company holds on gen-
eral deposit upward of $500,000. Mr. Cook was for a long time cashier of
the ; Nyefand;Ormsby. : County Bank of Carson City and Tonopah, and has
had;ajlong experience in "practical 'mining finance. His acceptance; of .the .
treasureship of the! Hearst-Jaggers assures for the company an honest
administration of its finances.. '.)-,
â¢The officers of the Hearst-Jaggers are a body, of practical mining men.

ginecrs and metallurgists that the im-
mense bodies of sulphide "ores which
are being- uncovered are similar in
character to the product of the
great Comstock lode of * Virginia
City, without* a question of
doubt. The vein which runs through
these properties varies from thirty to
300 feet in width, the formation being
porphyry and limestone. The walls
are perfect and the ore values | are
uniform, ranging from $30 to $10,000.
Lida has been laid out by a townsitc
company and the plat comprises about
400 acres. The company is composed
of well known capitalists. The towti
is now platted, streets have been laid
out and there are about 1200 people
on the ground. This company has
also secured the water rights, which
comprise splendid springs about a
mile distant from the town. The fall
gives a head of about 200 feet. A
water company has been formed, and
the engineer is now in San Francisco
securing pipe with the intention of
getting the water into the town as
soon as possible. The Lida Bank &
Trust Company, with a capitalization
of $50,000, subscribed and paid in, has
been organized and will be in opera-
tion within a few days, Mr. J. B.
Young of Goldficld being its presi-
dent. The president of the townsite
company is Mr. August Stein of Salt
Lake City, a man of great experience
in the handling of such matters. He
is also president of the water com-
pany.
In and around the town of Lida, it
is safe to say, there are no less than
twenty-five companies in active oper-
ation, and there arc at least ioo
groups upon which assessment work
is being done, and many new strikes
arc of almost daily occurrence. ' The
ledges are large, well defined and very
accessible. The climate is ideal, as
the elevation is about 6000 to 8000
feet.
An automobile company has been
organized and the machines are now
running between Goldfield and
Lida, making the *-\u25a0 round trip in
three hours, a distance of thirty miles.
Prompt mail connections are being
made by the Government, and post-
offices have been established. > The
town is well supplied with all kinds
of vegetables, and meats, hay, grain,
lumber and supplies are cheaper
than they are in Goldfield to-day. A
number of capitalists are making ar-
rangements to erect. two custom mills
here, and the writer predicts for Lida
one of the greatest camps ever dis-
covered in Nevada, with one of the
largest payrolls and the greatest out-
put. â¢ . .
On all of these properties are to be
found the workings as above mention-
ed, with thousands of tons of ore on
the old dumps thxt run from $100 to
$500 to the ton. These properties, of
course, were once known under Span-
ish names, but have recently been re-,
organized by the American hustler;
and they are all equipped, or are be-
ing equipped with large plants and
with forces of men, and are rapidly
nearing such a condition as to satisfy
some of our most eminent mining en-
The cost of mining and shipping,
together with the cost of treatment,
averaged about $200 a ton; and yet
the returns ran up into the thousands.
But the war of 1861 caused a cessa-
tion of operations, as well as an in-
vasion of California by the pioneer
mining man, and these ancient mines
have lain dormant for nearly thirty
years.
The ore to be found upon the
dumps of the Goldfield-Lida Gold
Mining Company at Lida, the
Goldfield - Lida Bonanza Mining
Company, the Wisconsin Mining
Company, the Florida Mining Com-
pany, the Brown Hope Mining
Company, the Colorado, the Death
Valley and the Lida Gold Mining
Company is the best illustration of
what this camp has produced in the
past.
The new mining 'district of Lida,
situated in the southwestern corner
of Esmeralda County, Nevada, was,
in the early sixties, a camp of con-
siderable prominence and notoriety,
and a most wonderful producer.
The old Spanish legends surround-
ing some of the properties in this vi-
cinity are numerous and worthy of
credence, for here are to be found
many of the underground workings
from which a vast amount of wealth
was taken in the early days, almost
from the surface. It is a well-known
fact that the crude methods in vogue
at that time, and the lack of mining
implements and tools, made_ mining
operations slow and expensive, and
the channels made in sinking inclines
down to the fifty and seventy-five
foot levels, with steps hewn into the
solid rock to serve as ladders, lead
one to believe that the place was once
inhabited by some ancient race.
Some of the old Spanish records
show that the ore was taken out with
the Spanish nose-drill hawkeyed
pick, and was hauled by ox teams
across the desert 400 miles to the Pa-
cific Coast, and shipped around the
Horn in sailing vessels and sold in
Wales.

U&A, at an elevation of 7000 feet. The
property was acquired for $50,005 from
the original locators, Lichleiter and
Jagrels, who located the mine in 1857.
These men were among the first pio-
neers of Southern Nevada 'and have
been taking:. ore from this mine for the
last thirty-flve years.
The old shaft which was sunk by the
former owners Is down 100 feet and is
ctill productive of splendid values. This
company is now driving a tunnel on the
vein, which is penetrated at a distance
of 160 feet, developing: a rich body of
gold and sliver ore. Fifty tons of this
ore is now on the dump awaiting
shipment. The company is also sinking
a double compartment shaft which Is
about twenty-five feet from the old
working. This shaft will be sunk to
a depth of 200 feet before drlrtlng to
crosscut the ledge is undertaken. Grass
samples taken from the croppings
which follow the vein on the surface
ebow an average assay of from 94000.00
to $6000.00. Assays made from ore ta-
ken from tbe tunnel on April 19th ran
as follows: Assay No. 1, $7500; assay
No. 2. J5675; assay No. S. $9500â a1l in
gold and silver, carrying a large per-
centage of lead.
The ledge Is widening at this point
and the men are working in three feet
of solid ore. Neither the hanging or
foot walls are visible.
A complete plant of mining machin-
ery is now on the way from Denver
and will be installed at the mine upon
its arrival at Lida.
It is the intention of this company to
build a tramway system for the dis-
tance of two and a half miles to facili-
tate the handling of the ore and greatly
increase the shipping capacity of the
mine.
The treasury stock of this mine is
now selling for 25c per share, this
price being subject to market changes.
All moneys derived from the sal* of
stock will be utilized solely for de-
velopment purposes.

Thl3 la one of the strongest mining
companies organized , in Southern Ne-

The holdings of this company include
the famous Wisconsin mine, which nas
been' a producer for thirty-five years.
The property comprises the following
claims:
The Nevada, the King Solomon, the
Lucky Jim, the Lucky. Jack, the Bello
of 'Lida/ the Mountain View, the Bernice
and the Mark Twain.
It is the purpose ' of : ; this com-
,pany to erect' a 100-ton/ smelter .in
addition, to- the installation of the
largest plant of mining machin-
ery, installed in Nevada" since! the 'day?
of the Comstock. Preparations are now
being made to sink a triple compart-
ment shaft, as the volume of ore in
sight in this mine is so vast that the
facilities of a single or double compart-
ment shaft would be entirely inade-
quate. .
The machinery to be instaHed will cost,
in round figures, $60,000.00. The vein
on this property is 100. feet wide and
there is ; three i feet of ore that assays
$2.00 per pound. The company has, six
feet^bf ore. that will average $200 to the
tori. The-mlne' has been examined'by,
someof the most expert mining men of
this country and the property is said to
be withou t a ; peer jin 'the State of Ne-
vada and is similar in every respect to
the celebrated Comstock; 1 J â¢- - ;..'.'.

The property has an excellent .show-
ing. Company only recently incor-
porated. Seven' m^n are how doing
surface work on the property, mak-
ing preparations to sink a double

ing mines and high-priced stocks
than any other district in Southern
Nevada. , Owing to the location of
this mine it may be considered a safe
investment with a promising future.
The principals of this company are
known as aggressive mining men and
will rush development work on. this
property in order to determine' its
value.
All money derived from^the sale of

mountain road winding its way SO miles
by southwest is reached the "Second
Virginia City," more commonly lenowtt
to the prospectors of Southern Nevada
and the Golden State aa the town ot
LIDA.
Lida stands alone as one of the eld-
est and richest producers ot Sontbera
Nevada. It Is here that the Mexican
miners in the early days of '65 discov-
ered the famous Death Valley mine.
This mine has a record of havtas pro-
duced not less than $300,000.00 â this
rich mineral having been taken from
shafts and gopher holes during a period
of not less than 10 years. .It Is proba-
bly one of the most historical mines to
be found anywhere in 1 the -wordd. Min-
ing in those days was very crude as
compared with modern methods navr
employed. By careful observation of
the old workings one will observe that
probably no machinery was utilized in
developing the mine, and. In fact, tho
mine is still undeveloped.
To the scientific mining men o: to-day
the mines of this vicinity present a very
odd aspect. The shafts of the Sealh
Valley mine measure about three feet
in diameter and are cut In a circular
fashion, such as we used to dig wells.
\u25a0They used no hoist, but lifted the ore
by a burro, which, was told to ,'raove
on by the use of & rope.. Tha ore buck-
ets were raised thus to the fcead of Vxa
shaft Many little Incline tunnels ara
found in the sides of the hill, which
are deep enough to permit the ore being
dragged out on sleds. The above condi-
tion not only existed in the iJeath Val-
ley property, which Is one of the oldest
In the State of Nevada, but the same
evidence Is still vlsfble on the old work-
Ings of the Centennial and Blua Dick.
the Florida and several of the other
mines that were producers In those
days. ,
With the discovery of Goldfleld the
prospector who moved oat into tne
desert was not long In finding the hid-
den treasure In the mountains -which
surrounded the old town of Lido.

Goldfield, like many other mining
centers, has tributaries which lead Into
'The earnest legitimate mining man of
the West looks further than the dawn
Of morning. He seeks the depths and
looks with smiling faJth into the fu-
ture, ke knows that geological condi-
tions must be favorable. He does not
exploit barren, hungry ground, nor sink
a well In the valley wash. He looks for
contacts and mineralization, and thoss
who pin their faith to him are given &
fair and honest chance. :>.*
It was these same men that bunt
from the sagebrush roots what Is now
known as the very center of the min-
eral zoneâ the hustling city of Gold-
field, with mountains of ore. tha 'rich-
est that have ever been discovered any-
where in the world. These plodders are
to-day transforming the desert waste
with buildings 'pt stone â -strong finan-
cial institutions, which hold within
their vaults the treasure that has been
dug from beneath the very ground on
which they stand.
They sow and others reap; yet most
times when they labor victoriously they
hold _ a mining country with the
strength of their successes.
The men who earnestly labor to bring
forth the treasures from the hills* grow
to love their work, and soon learn the
cunning devices of nature In hiding
from human eye the precious metals.
They labor patiently In the laboratory
te untangle the hidden secrets of the
commingling elements that form the
quartz. Like the . alchemists of old,
they perform miracles, and often the
reward is but the knowledge of labor
well performed, j â¢/ V. ,
There Is a vast field for legitimate
mining- In Southern Nevada. Nature
with lavish hand has cast her golden
treasure like a prodigal spendlns'hls
patrimony. In the mountains that line
our desert wastes He hidden untold and
unsarnered wealth. To gather It Is the
duty of man, turning it, when received,
into the channels of commerce and add-
ing, to the hurried wheels of Industry
additional revolutions.

brought to America a few years after. 1
He graduated as a mining engineer at the
Houghton School of Mines, Michigan, and
went .to Butte, . Mont., .in 1392, where he
secured employment with Heinze at the
M. O. P. smelter. From there ha went
to the assay ofQce of the Parrott Com
pany, and from there was engaged as
mining engineer to the Clark 'properties,
of which he subsequently became super
intendent. He has since acted in a like
capacity for the Parrott Company, the
Farrell mines at Tlntic and for five years
was general superintendent of the Pitt *-
burg- Alontar.rt- mine at Butte. which po
sition he held at the time of his appoint
ment to the Montana-Tonopah mine in
September last. His management of this

ENTERPRISING NEVADA JOURNALIST
Sam C. Dunham, Editor of Tonopah Miner
and Official of U. S. Government.
Forty years ago John McKane was born
in Dunfermllne, Scotland, the same little
burg where Andrew Carnegie first saw
the light. Trained to the banking busi
ness,' he fillefi a responsible position with
the Royal Bank of Scotland and subse
quently accepted the position of manager
of the Royal Bank of Canada at New
Brunswick, end In that capacity distin
guished himself as the most successful
manager that Institution possessed, carry-
Ing through with great success and con
elflerabU profit to the bank Immense
transactions In coal, fishing and lumber
Interests.
He resigned that position when the
great mineral discoveries In British Co
lumbia attracted co many capitalists to
the West. He was one of the earliest
operators In the Rossland and Lardeau
districts, and Is to-day the owner of a
big silver lead mine in the Elocan which
could be worked at great profit if the lead
market In Canada was as good as it is In
America.
A little over tfcree years ago he heard
ef the great Ttmopah and lost no time In
hcrrylng to it and, after carefully exam
ining tho camp, acquired the Tonopah Ex
tension and Golden Anchor claims In the
firm belief that the great veins developed
in the Tonopah and Montana Tonopah
mines woulfl extend into that ground. A
visit to PittÂ£burg of a few days and Mr.
McKase had Interested in both properties
Mr. Charles M. Schwab and a few of His
Intimate friends, all of whom are million
aires.
Work was commenced at the Tonopah
Extension* mine In May* 1903, and there
were not wanting the usual , "knotfkers"
who called it a "wildcat." AÂ» Mr. Mc-
Kane's knowledge of the. camp increased
he added to these purchases the proper

addition to the above mentioned inter
ests In Tcnopah, Mr. McKane has pur
chased and incorporated the Midway Ex
tension Mining Company, the Tonopah
Ophir King, and is a director of the Bel
mont Extension. With. these vast inter
ests in the greatest undeveloped mineral
zone in the world. It would not be sur
prising If his wealth eventually equals
that of his fellow townsman the ."Iron
King." In appearance John' AtcKane Is a
typical Britisher, of \u25a0 commanding \u25a0 height

great success.

formerly known as. the Pittsburgh, â¢
If he had done nothing else these alone
would be a standing monument to his
acumen and Judgment. For the Tonopah
Extension is the geratest mine in Tono
pah to-day. When the Goldfleld excite
ment was starting he. with Patrick Clark
of Spokane, took a bond on the Jumbo for
$70,000 for a two-thirds interest Mr.
Clark withdrew, but Mr. McKane con
tinued working and eventually accepted
a tenth Interest (to relinquish his bond.
He then took a lease of 100 feet and with
Dr. E. Bowers as a partner shipped from
a total depth of 200 feet over $â¬00,000 worth
of ore in lees than five months. He then
purchased a half Interest in the Quartz
ite lease at Diamondfleld, which is pro
ducing twenty tons of high grade ore
daily. He is also a part owner of the
Florence mine, the Highland group and
others.
Both of these veins are characteristlo
of the camp and carry high-grade ship
ping ore in recurring chutes, and this
mine Is also remarkable for Its won
derful specimen ore of great value, i
In ell, - since ! starting work In May,
1903, over 4000 feet of development work
has been done to develop these two
gigantic veins. Most of the work has
been concentrated on the No. 1 vein,
which has now been proven on Its
course for 870 - feet at a depth of 400
At a - depth of 220 feet what Is known
as No. 1 vein was struck and sunk on
to the 270-foot level, and drifted on for
345 feet west. It passed out of the shaft
at this level, but at 400 feet it was
opened up in a crosscut, and drifts
were run west 345 feet end east to the
boundary of the Buckboard claim.
proving.it to be the Mizpah vein. It
was also crosscut on thiÂ« level, and
proved to be 33 feet wide between well
defined walls, while on the 600-foot
level It Is 32 feet wide, and on both
levels will : average clear across . from
$40 to $100 per ton. At a depth of 400
feet No. 2 vein was cut and proved to
be 86 feet wide, of milling grade. It
was sunk on 90 feet, then drifted on for
150 feet on the hanging wall side and
crosscut again, maintaining its width
and values.
STRIKING THE] VEIN NO. 1.
The most prominent' lndividual oper
ator In Tonopah is John McKane, who
has sole management of - the mining
properties owned by a group of Pitta
burg capitalists, of whom Mr. Charles
M. Schwab ia the best-known member.
In a recent visit to Tonopah this gen
tleman Etated that he was so pleased
with the prospects of his present hold
ings that he has determined to add to
his Investments in the camp, and it is
gratifying to think that he and his
friends own the best mine In Tonopah
and the best unproven ground on the
western extension of the vein system
of the camp. -.
Credit must be given to John Mc-
Kane for Inducing Eastern capitalists
to invest in. the camp, and also for his
judgment in acquiring the . properties
now being developed. The most Impor
tant of these to-day is the Tonopah
Extension mine, owned by. the Tonopah
Extension Mining Company, and three
patented claims located west of and
adjolnln g the j Buckboard claim and
covering 3000 feet of the extension of
the Mlzpah vein. The opening up of
this mine is another Instance of "blind"
sinking, the shaft having been located
on what was believed to be the course
of the Mlzpah vein.
Adjoining. this property on the north
and the Midway-Mining Company on
the west are two patented claims, the
property of the Golden Anchor Mining
Company, which vis now be
ing actively developed. . The main
shaft is \now down 750 feet,
and a crosscut run north i to cut
the ' MacDohald \ vein of the" Montana
mine, assaying. up to $200 per ton,;and
this is now developed '" and " the' ; main
shaft being- sunk to . the 900-foot level.
This mine is equipped with a 60-horse
power steam hoist. Adjoining this mine
SOME ADJOINING CLAIMS.
As Installed/the plant comprises two
boilers, one of 125 horsepower, which
has been connected with the old 50
horsepower boiler, and so arranged that
both can be worked ; together or . Inde

or driving the compressor. The com
pressor is known as the "New York
Franklin," having duplex steam and
compound alr^cylinders, with separate
free air inter-cooler, and having a ca
pacity of 1225 cubic feet per minute.
This compressor will operate 10 three-
Inch piston drills at this altitude. Two
drills are now at work and the remain

ciprocating piston and mechanically
operated valve, which Insures great
economy in the use of air, â¢ and -those
now In use are drilling ten feet per

in the use of water. There is
also a complete assay, office, ,and,the
orehouse is fitted with a 100-ton Gates
gyratory crusher, and a railroad switch
has been constructed to the orehouse,
and the amount of ore shipments will
shortly be greatly \u25a0 augmented. < On -May
15 the company declared a dividend of
5 cents per; share, payable July I', and
John "McKane was elected president. -

PITTSBURG PROPERTIES IN TONOPAH
INCLUDE TONOPAH EXTENSION
AND OTHER MINES.
Probably the most prominent and best
known man in Tonopah to-day, and since
its birth, is Tasker L. Oddle. who obtain
ed the assays of the first ore from the
Mizpah vein for James I* Butler. Mr. Od
dle was born in Orange,' N. J.. 34 years
ago, and ; studied law in New York and
was admitted to the. New Tork bar, in
which city, he became one of the nan
gers of, a big estate of 5U.000.000. Seven
years ago Anson Phelps Stokes selected
him to go to Austin, Nev., to investigate
the accounts and management of his min
ing," banking and railroad Interests there,
and he was successful in exposing. the ln
fam6us frauds in connection with the
mining operations which caused Mr.
Stokes to close the mines In disgust. Dur
ing his residence at Austin he became a
director of the Nevada, Central Railroad
and the Austin State Bank, and earned
the friendship of all who appreciated his
sterling ' qualities. Becoming fascinated
with mining and realizing the enormous
possibilities of Nevada, he decided to llva
in that State and Joined the Nevada bar,
removing to Belmont, where he was elect
ed District Attorney for Nye County.
His i legal practice, however, really be
came but a secondary consideration to hi*
passion for . mining,- on which ha epent
all his money' and enaured many hard
ships In the mountains, to at last strike
the "pay streak" which changed his for
tunes. | Butler returned to Belmont with
his discovery of the Tonopah mine and
offered Oddie an interest for setting the
ore assayed. The story of his financial
success feince then is one of rapid pro
gression, punctuated by hard work and
privations in the early days of Tonopah
that even many men more roughly
brought up would have shrunk from.
Wrapped up in the Idea that Nevada was
the coming mineral State and that Tono
pah would be its star camp, he used all
the money he made in the Tonopah mine
in outfitting prospectors, developing pros
pects and opening up mines in that sec
tion of the country. â¢".',, â¢
On the formation of the Tonopah Min
ing Company he was appointed general
manager and was most conspicuous in the
development- of ' the camp. He was one
of the. i locaters of the Midway mine, of
which he is a director, and the heaviest
individual stockholder: he is also one of
the owners and a director of the Midway
mill. He was instrumental in forming
the Tonopah Belmont and Jim. Butler Min
ing companies, in which" latter he had
the valuable aid of Charles E. Knox of
the Montana-Tonopah. This great consol
idation was of immense benefit to Tono
pah. It not only terminated some vexa
tious litigation between the Salt Lake and
Tonopah Mining companies, but immedi
ately placed in the hands of wealthy cap
italists -valuable mineral land which is
now being developed and will add vastly
to the output . of . the camp. Mr. Oddie
was Quick to see when Tonopah needed
a bank, and was one of the organizers of
the : Ny c County j Bank, of which he was
the first president/ until the other day,
when he resigned 'to join Senator Nixon
in the formation of a national bank. ' His
ideas, always broad, were set upon a rail-
on . the - north" is ?the Bobtail' claim,
owned by. the Midway Extension Min
ing Company, which covers the exten
sion â¢of the northern part of the Mid
way company's western' boundary.
Mr. McKane has also recently- ac
quired control of the Tonopah Inde
pendent Mining Company, owning four
claims north of the Bobtail. South of
the Tonopah Extension mine and ad-
Joining are* the patented claims, the
property of the Red Rock Consolidated
Mining Company, of which John Mc-
Kane' is president. The ! property ad-
Joins the Ohio Tonopah Mining Com
pany on the north, and a shaft has
been sunk to a depth of 265 feet. A 60
horsepower steam hoist is now being
installed, and sinking will then be re
sumed.
West of and adjoining the .Tonopah
Extension - mine, are ten patented
claims, the property of the. McKane
Mining Company. The main shaft,
3150 . feet west of the Tonopah Exten
sion shaft, has now .reached a depth
of 765 feet, ' and has just entered the
lode porphyry, and as soon as sufficient
depth in this has been reached cross
cutting will be commenced for the
Tonopah Extension veins.
The . development of this group is be
ing watched with intense interest by
the whole mining world, as the opening
up of the Tonopah veins in this ground
proves their extent for a distance of
8000 feet. That it will be done there Is
no. shadow of a doubt, as the" veins in
the; Tonopah Extension "mine are
stronger, better denned and richer than
in any other part of the camp. It was
the opinion of . Professor Spurr that
Tonopah's best -mines would be opened
up in. this western flat, it being situate
outside the faulted zone. The theory
has so far been ; confirmed by, the de
velopment in the Tonopah Extension
mine, where one drift has been* run on
No. 1 vein for 500 feet, and no fault
disclosed, . a development hitherto un
precedented iivrhe other big mines.
.By a reference to the map of the dis
trict it will be seen that in acquiring
these properties John McKane, like a
good : general, secured command of the
ground through which the whole of the
vein system of Tonopah, except the
Valley View vein, must pass. â¢\u25a0,-_-,-
All of these claims are covered by a
wash and overflow to a depth that can
only be determined by sinking: "blind."

more earnestly than anyone, and of which
he la a director as well as of the Tono
pah and Goldfleld Railroad.
If It were left to this man to choose a
motto for the State, It would be "Ad
vance Nevada." for this Is his great
wish, and to further It he has been to
the front at every new "strike" with,
prospectors and money for development.
At Goldfleld he was one of the earnest
and heaviest Investors, sinking over UO.
000 of his own money before realizing a.
dollar. Then he bought into the Kendall
lease, from which $75,000 was extracted in
a few days from surface ore. In Dla
monfield he is a great believer, and Is the
owner of nearly twenty valuable rtÂ»fmÂ«,
Southwest of Goldfleld he is the owner
of valuable properties and also tome good
copper claims south of Lida. Nor was he
slow In becoming Interested In Bullfrog;
by "right of location he Is tfcs owner
of over thirty valuable claims, and wu
one of the purchasers of the claims owned
by the Bullfrog "Western Mining Company,
of which he is a director. By purchase ha
has become a large owner In the Bullfrog
Eclipse, admittedly one of the best prop
erties In .the - camp, and also- bought a
big Interest ' In the Tramp claims, for
which he was offered JIOO.OCO profit. In
this district \u25a0 with" others he has pur
chased Petty** ranch, where there Is &
supply iof -1,000,000 gallons of water per
day. His Interests in. the Funeral Range
and Kawlch Mountains axe also .valua
ble and ; extensive. - It ! must not/ how
ever, be thought that Mr. Oddie has no
other pursuit than mining. A lover o !
fine horses and < cattle. It was 'but an
other step to breed them. To do this he
purchased a beautiful ranch In .Monitor
Valley, about ninety miles north, of Ton
opah. \u25a0 and . has . stocked this with thor
oughbred pedigree Hereford cattle, many
of which are pri2e winners, majdng a
herd only equaled on tho Paciflo Coast.
Thoroughbred - horses are also raised
here. He has since purchased five other
ranches, giving him a range of 150 miles
over the Monitor Mountains and .valley.
and sheep raising and wool growing: will
be added to his many interests. The can
yons * In the Monitor Mountains' yield
abundant water and on one ranch Mr.
Oddle has a supply of from 4,000.000 to 8,-
000.000 gallons, which would flow into Ton
opah. - He believes the day Is not far dis
tant when enormous mills in Tonopah
for reducing the millions of tons of low
grade ores which are being opened up !n
Tonopah and the surrounding districts will
require vast bodies of water, as will also
the Immense population which will come
to reside in Tonopah. He has figured that
this water can be brought to Tonopah
and sold at a price that will make; s3
ore a bonanza and yet yield him a hand
some profit on the money invested.
Last November Mr. Oddie was elected
a State Senator and was instrumental in
the legislation which changed the county
seat of Nye County from Belmont to Ton
opah, as well as other legislation benefi
