KING SUFEERS
FROM A COLD
By the authorities who have him In
charge Stark is considered a shrewd
crank, with only the one dangerous
hobby for the use of explosives, of
which he lias made a study. Otherwise
he is considered sane and being a well
read man of more than ordinary ability
his presentation of his defense prom
ises to be able.
That he made threats against Mr.
Huntington and his son there is no rea
son to doubt. He told several attorneys
what he I proposed to do, they having
refused to institute a damage suit for
him. He was closely watched by de
tectives day and night and on one oc
casion tried to reach Mr. Huntlngton
in his hotel, but an officer frustrated
the attempt. It is also known that
Stark priced explosives and for -days
spent many hours in the vicinity of ths
railroad offices.

LOS ANGELES, March 3.â Joseph II.
Stark, who was arrested yesterday
afternoon for insanity and accused of
threatening to blow iip the Huntlngton/
shaps.and to kill H. E. Huntingdon, tiig
son and all the employes of the com'
pany with dynamite, proposes to stren
uously contest the effort to have him
committed to ah asylum. If he can
prove the allegations he makes, and he
says he can, the case will be a most
sensational one.
Stark has interested certain fraternal
organizations in his case, secured coun
sel and says he will fight for his liberty.
He charges that owing to the fact that
he was injured In a street railway ac
cident the company desires to prevent
him from prosecuting a damage suit in
the courts and to that end the de
tectives of the company have had him
arrested as an insane person. He does
not deny^that he visited certain places,
but asserts that the railway detective3
plied him with liquor, aroused his anger
against the company and caused him to
say things which he would not have
said In his sober moments. He denies
that he remembers having made any
threats, avers that it was never , his
intention to use explosives to enforce
his demands upon the company and
declares that his arrest Is the result
of persecution. to prevent him from se
curing a just return from the company.

counties telling of heavy losses from
last night's prairie fire. In almost
every instance the fires were caused
V>y people burning stubble and pasture
lands. The high wind came unexpect
edly and the fires were beyond control
ir. a short time.
This served the purpose of checking
the advance lines of the fire, but was
of little avail In hindering the contin
ued rolling of the firebrands Into the
streets of the city. In more than a
hundred places flames arose from
dwellings, barns and outhouses, but
wherever a blaze grew men were pres
ent to quench it with water. As a re
eult of the cool Judgment of the fight
.cra the city's loss was only $10,000.
FAMILIES ARE HOMELESS.
Two thousand men turned their ef
forts to checking the grass borders of
the reservation at the city limits. Wa
ter from every source, carried in every
conceivable way, was distributed along
the line and carried all around the city
limits.
Late at night the fire began moving
.southward toward this city. At 12
o'clock midnight 5000 people of this
city were up to battle with the flames.
The advance line of the fire was fully
â¢two miles in length and moved in a
B'emicircle form.
. . At Hobart, the county seat of Kiowa
County, the fire destroyed numerous
outlying buildings. The 75.000 acres of
Government, military and timber and

CHEFU, March 3.â Six Japanese cruisers, escorting ten transports, have i been sighted steaming in the direction of the Gulf of Liaotung. This movement
is connected with the reported intention to effect a landing north of Saddle Bay, for the capture of Newchwang. From Russian sources come reports of
an engagement yesterday in the vicinity of the Yalu River between small parties of scouts, who exchanged shots and retired. The Japanese forces have
approached to within three days' march of the Russian encampment, the latter retiring to await reinforcements. Owing to the heavy weather it is difficult
to proceed. A big battle is expected shortly. .;

CELEBRATES ARBOR DAY
When is a piano not a piano?
When it is an orchestra, with Harold
Bauer at the baton!
Mr. Bauer's "Walkurenritt" of last
night's recital â his own and a brilliant
arrangement, by the way â set one to
suspecting the superfluousness of the
orchestra. It was superbly adequate
as a transcription and played with a
wild sweep, a massive volume of toneâ
marvelously differentiated in color â
that gave the .noble turmoil of the
Walkyrie ride with true orchestral
magnificence.* The applause that fol
lowed bordered on the hysterical.
But Mr. Bauer "began with Beethoven,
the Appassionata Sonata. Here the
pianist is at his mostâ until perhaps hi3
Schumann. The first movement I have
never heard more nobly rendered. Mr.
Bauer's sense of rhythm is hypnotic.
I noticed both in the Beethoven and
Schumann sonatas (of the other even
ing) the accuracy of the intervals be
tween each movement. The pianist
had his audience absolutely hypnotized
â not a hand marred the sacred stretch
of silence. Barring what to me seemed
a- certain overcharged sentiment m
the second variation of the Andante,
the performance spelt perfection. ?
The Schumann "Krelslerlana" again
fcund Mr. Bauer in brilliantly respons
ive mood. It is a 'delicatessen counter
oi whimsies, their caprice, witchery,
romance, finding subtlest sympathy in
their Interpreter. The legato of. tha
second number was a. particular won
der of bell-like tones. The remaining
pieces included the Mendelssohn Cap
rlccio (E .minor), Brahm's Intermezzo,
Prelude and Barcarolle of Chopin, and
the Liszt D flat Etude. The Wagner-
Brasstn "Fire Music"* was Included
among the encores. A large house waa
in attendance and was rapturously re
sponsive. The farewell recital is dated
for Saturday afternoon, with the A flat
(op. ' 110) . sonata of Beethoven as chief
ornament.

seals on the Pribyloff Islands .would
have on Canadian sealing .Interests
say that they do not believe Congress
will allow the bill to pass, but that if
it did it would improve the price of
skins in London. The sealers here are
not much concerned about the pro
posed measure, as they say that it can
only have the effect of destroying a
monopoly enjoyed by an American
company and ultimately benefit the
Victoria sealers. They are aware that
the PribyJoff Island Company, is doing
well every season and if prohibited
from killing there would probably
take to pelagic sealing, like the Ca
nadians.

WASHINGTON, March 3.â The In
terior. Department to-day rejected all
the bids submitted several days ago for
the supply of from 150,000 to 250,000 bar
rels of Portland cement to the Govern
ment for the Salt River Irrigation pro
ject in Arizona. The action is the result
of the alleged excessive prices submitted
by the cement manufacturers, the de
partment stating that first-class Port
land cement can be manufactured at
the dam site on Salt River from good
materials at hand there for less' than
$3 a barrel, including the entire cost
of the plant, fuel, operation, etc. This
figure would make a saving of about
$2 a barrel, the department report says,
on the basis of the lowest regular bid,
or a saving of $300,000 for 150,000 bar
rels, or $500,000 for 250,000 barrels, the
largest amount to be supplied.
The department will now consider tho
question of erecting a plant for the
Government manufacture of the ce
ment, the purchase of the supply in
open market or readvertiseraent of bids.

O'Brien was admitted to St. Eliza
beth's Asylum In 1893. He was la,ter
paroled, but was returned in 1897. He
served in the Sixth Cavalry and the
Third Artillery.
The greatest consternation prevail-'
ed in the department when the. sound:
of the shooting was heard. Women
rushed from the rooms, screaming and
soon were 'joined by a number of the
male clerks. From every quarter came
army officers in uniform and a vast
throng clogged the corridors, where
O'Brien was struggling to break away
from his captors. The man was taken
to the police station. It required four
men to get him out of the building.
O'Brien, or Duffy, came to the War
Department early and hung around
the building for more than an hour.
He was escorted to the record divi
sion by Charles Brandt, the chief of
the division, and expressed dissatis
faction with his discharge papers.
Then, without a word of warning/ he
drew a pistol from his pocket and
aimed it at Brandt's head, j* ,;Brandt
dodged and the bullet entered the'
arm of Wieker. He then turned the
weapon upon Miss Sexton and fired.
She, too, dodged" and the bullet strucjk
Manning. There Were five other
clerks in the room at the time and but
for the quickness of Messenger Daw
son the maniac undoubtedly would
have shot, them all. - Dawson, how

is on the right side and is regarded

' Scott said he accepted the state

he desired to say that he never before

Swanson asked further for. a copy of

Scott explained . that these statements
were made Â¦ several v- years ; ago, and
the papers might not be easily pro
cured. He - said that he had. made
full apology to Mr. Cleveland. Scott

"My inquiries concerning Mr. Taylor

vince me that his character is very un

,*'But the .naval officer is a naval pfll
cer," 6aid he," "pure and simple, and the
'American navy bounds his complete
hcrizon. To him the navy is right and
the naval; board has run too much in
the direction of enormous ships."
The naval, board programme contem
plated forfy-elght battleships and
twenty-four armored cruisers, and
when that stage was reached an ap
propriation"; of: $200,000,000 a year would
be'necessary for the navy. He thought
it probable that the appropriation re
quired next "year would be $120,000,l>00.
If, :,however, the scale should be kept
-down to the present rate of increase,
the appropriation would be increased.
At the suggestion of Hale an appro
priation- of $400,000 for the restoration
of the frigate Constitution was in
serted.

"In our navy," said Hale, "there Is
talk of putting many of our vessels,
such as the Oreiron, Indiana and oth
ers of the same class, on the retired
list."
"I hope they won't retire the Oregon,"
said Stewart.
"Well, they ought not to," said Hale,
"but she has not the stateroom facil
ities that meet the fancy of naval offi
cers. She has the same number of
13-inch guns and the same fighting
capacity. Nothing suits naval officers
except the largest battleships."
; He expressed the opinion that the
present war in the Orient would show
that other vessels are more valuable
than large battleships, but admitted
that no definite conclusions could be
drawn until the smoke lifted.
Hale said he had no censure for?;the
officers of the navy.
Hale classed Great Britain first,
France second and the United States
third in naval strength, saying the
popular impression that Germany out
ranked this country ' was fallacious.
Hale acceded to a proposition by Per
kins that in effectiveness of appliances
the United States stood next to Great
Britain. This was due to the fact that
we had been able to take advantage
of the mistakes of European powers.
Hale said that Japan was the small
est of the naval powers, with the ex
ception of Austria, but had' an advan
tage in. being only a few hundred
miles from the farthest naval opera
tions In which she might become In
volved. ' n 'i ?> â¢// ','Â¦'Â¦'
"WASHINGTON, March 3. â For al
most four hours to-day the â¢ Senate,
while technically engaged on the naval
appropriation bill, discussed a wide
range of subjects, including the pol
icy of the United States in the Philip
pine Islands and the Russo-Japanese
war. The principal participants were
Messrs. Hale, Bacon, Lodge, Depew,
Patterson, Perkins and Money. Hale,
In charge of^the naval bill, criticized
the plans of the naval board as to. an
establishment beyond the needs of
the country. . â¢
Lodge, Depew and Perkins defended
the naval officers. Lodge declared a
large navy essential to the mainte
nance'of peace. Money said he did
not consider the total appropriation
of $96,000,000 carried by the bill as
excessive under our present policy in
the . Orient. He, 1 however, "criticized
the policy, as did other Democratic
speakers.

The presence of a party of Great
Northern surveyors just north of Lyn
den is causing considerable specula
tion as to their mission. Lynden is
just five miles' south of the 1 interna
tional boundary line and it is reported
that the party has run two prelimin
ary surveys between here and the line.
The surveyors are working .eastward
and it is . believed they are seeking a
new route into Vancouver, B. C, for
the ' Great Northern-Kootenai â¢ coast
line.
Hill has encountered considerable
Canadian opposition in the construc
tion of. this line because of the fact
that it runs nearly . entirely through
American territory and it is possible
that he is seeking a. route nearer the
international line. .
Believed They Are Mapping Out Line

Burrows ruled the question
objected to was in order, and directed
the stenographer to read the question:
"How many children have you had
since the manifesto of 1890?" .
"Eleven since 1890," said. Smith.
"Each of my five wives has borne me
children."
"Since that time?" asked Burrows.
' "Since that time," the witness re
peated, in answer.
"I rather think," he added, "that one
of them has had three childrenâ I could
tell you a little later." i
He said in reply to Tayler that he
had . attended the dedication exercises
at the St. Louis Exposition and had
been accompanied by his plural wife,
Edna Smith, by name.
.. Tayler concluded with Smith and the
defense will examine " the ' witness ,' to-
"You must draw a distinction be
tween unlawful cohabitation and plural
marriage," he said. "The State law in
regard to the latter has been complied
with. No marriages have been per
formed with the sanction, approval,
consent, knowledge or connivance of
the church or its officials. But the
other law is the one I have presumed
to disregard, and which, as I have
said, I am ready to face rather than
disgrace myself or degrade my family
by turning them off."
Tayler resumed his questioning.
"You say there is a State law for
bidding polygamous cohabitation, and
you have been continuing to violate it
in utter disregard of the conse
quences?" he asked.
"I think I have," was the answer.
Burrows asked Smith if he had mar
ried any wives between the first, and
last he had mentioned during his state
ment to the committee,
"I have," said Smith.
"How many?"
"Three."
"Then, you' have' five wives now?"
said Burrows.
"That is correct," was the reply.
DIFFERENCE IN LAWS.
Smith paused for a moment, but
as Tayler prepared to ask another
question he again proceeded with h'.s
statement:
"I have continued to cohabit with
them since the manifesto of 1890, and
they have borne me chilcren since that
date. I was fully aware of what I was
dcing. I knew I was amenable to the
lew, but, as I say, I preferred to face
that situation rather than to desert
them. I have not cohabited with
these wives openly or flaunted the fact,
but I have acknowledged these wives
and children as my family. The people
of Utah have regarded the situation as
an existing fact. These people as a
rule are broad-minded and liberal in
their views and have conconed the of
fense â if offense it Is â rather than to
interfere with my situation as they
found It. It has been known what I
have been doing. I have not been in
terfered with nor disturbed in any
way. If I had been I was there to
answer the charges. I was willing to
face them and submit to the penalty,
whatever it might be." ' Â¦,
ried my first wife more than thirty
eight years ago, and my last wife more
than twenty years ago. By these wives
I have had children and I have pre
ferred to take my own chance with the
law and suffer any consequences the
law might visit upon me rather than
abandon these children and their moth
ers.
"This was the case and is the case
now. , But I was placed 'in this posi
tion," said Smith.' "I had a family
â * plural family. If you please. I mar
Mr. Smith asked and received per
mission to make a statement and then
answer the question in his own way.
He spoke with great feeling and di
rectness, just the reverse of his at
titude on the stand at yesterday's
hearing, saying:
"In regard to the status of polygamy
at the time of the manifesto I want to
say that after the hearing- before the
Master of Chancery I understood that
we should abstain from relations with
our plural families and that rule was
observed "up to the time the enabling
act went into effect admitting: Utah
as a State. Under that act the only
prohibition was that plural marriages
should cease. Nothing was said about
cohabitation with our wives."
"With the wives you had married
previous to the manifesto, you mean?"
interrupted Hoar.
"That is what I meant." said
Smith. "I understood that plural mar
riages were to cease and ever since the
manifesto until the present time there
never has been a plural , marriage In
the church performed in accordance
with its teachings or with the conniv
ance of the church," and he added with
greater emphasis: "I know whereof 1
speak."
Then, in answer to the question
whether polygamous . cohabitation was
regarded by the church as contrary to
the law, he answered: "It was." Con
tinuing he said:
CARE FOR FAMILIES.
Mr. Tayler asked: "Is cohabitation
with a plural wife contrary to the
rules of the church?"
The Mr. Tayler asked a number of
questions which brought out a state
ment from Mr. Smith regarding his
own position under the laws covering
polygamy. He acknowledged that he
had violated them continuously since
the manifesto of 1S90, and is^ ready
now and always has been to face the
laws of the land.
Senator Pettus made a protest against
the debate among members of the
committee, and Chairman Burrows
directed Mr. Tayler to' proceed. Ques
tions were then directed to ascertain
Mr. Smoot's knowledge of the poly
gamous marriages of Abraham H.
Cannon and whether Mr. Smith had
performed the service uniting Mr.
Cannon and Lillian Hamlin. Mr.
Smith said he had seen newspaper
reports saying- that he had done so, but
he denied the truth of the statements.
CONFESSION* OF POLYGAMY. '
had been a misunderstanding as to
whether Mr. Smoot was being tried
on the charges of polygamy and of
having taken an oath* incompatible
with his oath as a United States Sen
ator. Now, he said, it is apparent
that these charges are not pending in
this investigation.
Senator Dubois dissented from the
statement that there had been such a
misunderstanding and said the real
charge is that Mr. Smoot is a member
of a Mormon hierarchy which sub
scribes to vows in conflict .with the
laws of the country and was bound
to support such vows.
"For the first time in fifty years,"
said Dubois, "the relations, of this or
ganization toward the United States
are to be tried."
LAWMAKERS AND THE PROSECUTOR IX THE SENSATIONAL CASE
OF UNITED STATES SENATOR REED SMOOT, WHICH IS NOW
IN PROGRESS IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL.
WASHINGTON. March 3.â The Senate to
day confirmed the nomination of the Isthmian
Canal Commissioner*, and also the following:
Lieutenant Colonel James F. Randlette, U. S.
A., retired. Californlan. agent for the Indiana
of the Klowa Agency in Oklahoma.
NEW YORK. March 3.â With two firsts out
of a programme of sixteen movements, Wil
liam F. Uuffey of the New York Athletic Club
won the annual figure skating championship
of the United States at the St. Nicholas Skat
ing: Rink to-night.
When the committee was called to
order seven Senators were present-
Chairman Burrows gave the ruling on
the question asked of President Jo
seph F. Smith relating to the polyga
mous cohabitation of George F. Teas
dale, a Mormon apostle. Objections to
such questioning had been made by the
defendant. The cummittee ruled that
the testimony bearing upon plural mar :
riajres of any members of the twelve
apostles, of which Mr. Smoot is one, is
competent so far as it relates to such
polygamous cohabitation since Septem
ber 26, 1S30, the date of President
Woodruff's manifesto withdrawing the
order of the church commanding plural
marriages.
Senator Beveridge stated that there
SCXSATION FOK SENATORS
President Joseph F. Smith confessed
that he himself had continued to co
habit with his plural family since the
manifesto of 1S90, and that he realized
fully that he was violating the State
law. President Smith also testified that
Jieed Smooi tried to get the consent of
his associate apostles in the church be
f<5re he could become a candidate for
Senator.
The confession of President Smith I
Â¦was the sensation of the proceedings I
to-day before the Senate Committee on \
Privileges and Elections. Mr. Smith
said that the manifesto of 1S90 had left
him and others with plural families in
the unfortunate situation of being com
pelled to defy the law or desert their
families. For himself he had preferred
to "take chances with the law" rather
than to disgrace hiinself and degrade
hi*Â«Â£eraijyjiy abandoning his wives and
the children they had borne him. He
admitted that he had had children by
all of his five wives since the manifesto,
and said he had acknowledged them
openly without interference or disturb
ance from the p< ople of Utah, whom he
spoke of as liberal and broadminded.
The defendant will take the witness
eland to-morrow.
WASHINGTON, March 3.â Attorneys
for the protestants in the Smoot inves
tipaticn to-day said they intended to
I'rove that the defendant is associated
with an organization which practices
polygamy and connives at violations of
the law. and that his very vote as a
Senator of the United States is subject
to the wish and command of the Mor
mon church.

WiUard Runnels, a deputy sheriff,
is said to have chained Maki to the

from E. F. Richardson, who
has been sent to Telluride by the of
ficers of the' Western Federation ot
Miners to investigate this case. W.
D. . Hay wood, secretary of the Feder
ation, to-day sent the following tele
gram to the Telluride Union:
"Suffer, no more abuses. If you can
not get relief through the courts, you
still have left the power of self-de
fense."
I DENVER, Colo.. March 3. â Gov
ernor Peabody said to-day that al
though Telluride i3 still under mar
tial law, the military authorities were
not responsible for the, pillorying of
Harry Makl, a striking union miner.
who was kept chained to a telegraph
pole for an hour and a half because
he refused to work in the chain gang
after having; been convicted of va
grancy.
REDDING, March 3.â Duncan Camp
bell, a miner, 46 years of - age, Â¦Â¦â¢ em
ployed by the Great l Western '"-Â¦Â¦â¢: Gold
Company at. the Afterthought - mine,
threatened to chop off his 13-year-old
daughter's head yesterday, and the
miners at the Afterthought were afraid
he might carry the threat into effect.
Campbell procured an ax and started
for the place where his daughter was
staying, but friends interposed and
stopped him. Word was sent to Red
ding and an officer will leave to-mor
row to place him under, arrest. He is
being guarded now.
Campbell has been employed at the
Afterthought, two months. He Is ," a
good miner/and well liked by the
men in the camp. .That fact served to
save him from the. wrath of the miners,
who under ; -Â¦Â¦ ordinary crlcumstances
would have dealt harshly with one of
their* number, guilty of the acts that
are laid' at Campbell's door. On va
rious occasions lately Campbell has
told shocking stories to the miners
about his child, and on one or two oc
casions he has told them he intended
to kill her. Once he procured a pistol,
flourished it about, saying that he in
tended to go over and kill his daugh
ter, and started off as though intent
upon carrying out his 'threat. The
daughter lives in dread of the father
and is afraid she will be killed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"When I examined the secret collec
tion of documents in the case and saw
their miserable character, valuable
only because of the mystery cleverly
thrown about them, I concluded it was
necessary for justice to have the last
word, and it is my conviction that
there is not one of us If in the army
and not an officer now in the army
who would not have succumbed had
he been under an accusation thus man
aged."
Fearing disturbances during the pro
ceedings, the Government stationed
guards among the spectators and in
the corridors leading to the court, but
their presence was not rieqessary. The
crowd was interested, but there were
no demonstrations against the favor
able conclusions of the reporter and
Attorney General.
"One by one," the Attorney General
continued, "all the charges vanished,
leaving only accusations without im
portance or consistency, i
M. Boyer made an exhaustive review
of the case, declaring he could not find
any proof to establish the existence of
the document which- was da} -ned to
have been annotated by the German
Emperor, which, was transmitted to one
of Dreyfus' judges at Rennes. There
was no doubt, he added, of the trans
mission of the "Alexandrine," letter
with the . false date. The words in
Lieutenant Colonel Henry's handwrit
ing had an unfavorable effect upon the
court-martial.
M. Boyer concluded by saying that
the letters used against the accused
were falsified prior to the proceedings
of 1899, but he added that this had not
yet been judicially determined upon.
Attorney General Baudouin said that
when he began his consideration of the
Dreyfus case he was satisfied that a
judicial error had not been committed,
but as" the investigation proceeded his
amazement increased.
According to the Minister of Jus
tice another letter, signed "Alexan
drine," which Agent A. addressed
to Agent B., contained some words in
the handwriting of the late Lieuten
ant Colonel Henry, who committed
suicide in prison after having confess
ed to committing a forgery in the case.
This letter relates to the organization
of French railroads. M. Gribelin swore
during the inquiry of the Minister of
War that this letter was false. It was
true, however, that the date â¢ of this
document was March 28, 1895, when
Dreyfus Was imprisoned on Devils Is
land.
The existence of a traitor in the
French War Office was revealed by
an alleged foreign diplomat, who act
ed without compensation. It is now
claimed that Lieutenant Colonel
Henry in 1897 caused a book of ex
penditures to be recopied in order to
remove all trace of payments to this
diplomat, who, it has developed, was
an employe of the Intelligence Depart
ment.
It was claimed by those present in
court that if the new facts were ac
knowledged by the tribunal the in
nocence of Dreyfus would be estab
lished.
PARIS, March, 3. â The Court of
Cassation began lo-day the considera
tion of the appeal of Alfred Dreyfus
for a revision of his trial. Counselor
Chamberaud presided.
Though the general interest in the
case was not as gre.at as in previous
j-ears, yet the courtroom was crowded
with officers, soldiers anil lawyers, and
a number of. women, among. whom
were relatives of Dreyfus. - By their
side was former Colonel Picquart.
Dreyfus was not present, hia interests
being in the hands of Lawyer Mor
nard. The report of M. Brier, report
er of the court, which was read, pre
sented the two new facts upon' which
the Minister of Justice. M. Valle. re
commended a revision of the w*
These were set forth as follows:
The secret documents include a let
ter bearing the initial "D." Now, by
an affidavit of October 6, 1903, signed
by M. Gribelin, keeper of the archives:
it appears that this document previ
ously carried the letter "T." For
this latter was substituted a "D," and
thns the altergd document was pre
sented to the court at Rennes.
SANTA CRUZ, March 3.â A daring
hold-up occurred at noon to-day at
Scotts Valley, near this city. Claude
Hendricks,. aged about 20 years, was In
a wagon on his way home when a
masked highwayman jumped out from
the brush alongside the road and com
manded him to stop. Hendricks at
tempted to parley with the robber, but
desisted when the latter told him to
stop his foolishness and to quickly hand
over. his money. Hendricks complied by
giving the robber his purse, containing
$1 50.' The bandit then disappeared in
the brush and was last seen heading to
ward this city. â¢ .
The robber is described as being a
small man with a sallow complexion.
The mask did not cover his forehead.
He is thought to be an old hand, as he
did not display any nervousness when
he drew his revolver and ordered Hen
dricks to halt.

District Attorney Jerome, Coroner
Scholer and officials of the building'de
partment began an investigation to
day and will seek to place the respon
sibility for the disaster. The Coroner
said he had issued warrants for "Eu
gene" Allison, presumably Charles R.
Allison, of the Allison Realty . Com
pany, and also for Paul Schwandtner of
Pole & Schwandtner, the iron work
contractors. Allison, he explained, is
sick in bed at his home with nervous
prostration and that a lawyer repre
senting Allison assured him that, owing
to his client's condition, it would be
impossible to give him up- at the pres
ent time.
Among other warrants issued are
two for William O'Hea, chief architect
for Bogge & Neville, and Frederick
Mohn, an iron worker foreman for Pole
& Schwandtner. . Mohn, however, may
be among the dead.
Shirley Greene says his brother, Wil
liam R. Greene. 63 years old,' a foreman
on cement and fireproof work for the
Roebling Company, had not been seen
or heard from since yesterday, â¢ and is
supposed to have perished.
Shortly after 2 o'clock this morning
the sergeant of police in charge of the
ruins telephoned for an ambulance,
saying a man had been found there
who was still alive.
Allison was an expert gunner in the
United States Navy, serving in the
Spanish-American War. He returned
from the Philippines only a few months
ago. â¢
In a pocket of his coat was found
a letter written by Miss Amy L. Mar

that the letter Indicated that the cou

that they intended to reside in San

NEW YORK, March 3.â There are
fifteen dead, fifteen known to have
been injured and three persons re
ported missing as the result of the
collapse of the unfinished Hotel.Dar
lington building in West Forty-sixth
street yesterday and of the resultant
Injury t,o the Patterson Hotel, directly
in the rear of the collapsed building.
The search for the dead among the
twisted iron girders and masses of
stone continued all last night and to
day. A wrecking force is now at work
and is aided in its efforts by a steam
derrick. Many large arc lights have
been erected over the mass of twisted
timbers and beams and operations will
go on throughout the night.
Four bodies were in sight late to
night, but much work will still be re
quired to reach them.
The body of Frank Allison, brother
of Eugene Allison, president of the
Allison Realty Company, wa3 taken
from the ruins to-night. Allison is
supposed to have been on the ninth
floor of the building at the time of the
disaster. The body was found agafnst
the wall of the dwelling to the west.
It was horribly mangled and was in
a net work of iron girders. V v; .-Â¦'.'Â¦'-_

On account of the impossibility of defending the coast .at
Yinkow until such time as a thaw permits the construction of
entrenchments and forts, the Russians have prepared to retire up
the main railroad line. There are practically no defenses here,
and although the shifting and reshifting of troops and artillery to
the small forts at the mouth of the Liao River have the appear
ance of an intention to defend Yinkow, the military authorities
depend upon an inland engagement to put a stop to the Japanese
As far as yet known the only plans decided on are: First,
that General Kuropatkin's headquarters are to be at Mukden,
Viceroy Alexieff proposes to remain at Mukden indefinitely, .as
that city is the center of the Chinese administration and has a
viceroyal bureau ; second, that the plain west of Tashihchiao,
which is almost impossible of defense^, will be held if possible on
account of the 'railroad connection at Port Arthur; third,
Haiching and Liaoyang are the extreme limits to which troops
will be withdrawn, on account of the exposure of the railroad at
these points.
That the Japanese will arrive before a thaw permits the con
struction of defenses is believed to be practically certain. It
would appear, also, that the authorities expect. Port Arthur to be
besieged.

short," said G. A. Parkyns, assistant
general passenger and freight agent of
the Southern Pacific Railroad.
"The railroad companies have done
the ,very : best they could, and under
average conditions , our supply would
have been sufficient, but we have had
to face weather conditions In the East
that entirely upset all our estimates.
The Southern Pacific Company had 5000
cars under contract from the_^ Armour
people for this year, but Instead ' of
making three or four , trips with them
we. will. probably be able to make only
one. .It has been impossible to unload
the cars in the East, and they have
been held up in round houses and any
available place of storage until the
cold spell subsides. We now " have
about 500 cars at hand in the Los An
geles division, but as the shippers want
200 a day you can see how long they
will last."
A. H. Naftzger, president of the
Southern California Fruit Exchange,
said to-night:
"We sent out a bulletin to-day ad
vising growers to hold up ,on their
picking until we are able to find just
how we stand on the car question. We

of 30,000 carloads this year and we>

cannot count on the return of cars."

weather conditions in the East have
caused a shortage of cars In Southern

The matrimonial career of William

charged cruelty on the part of her hus

of the young couple interested them

MOSCOW, March 3.â M. Arkounln,
an actor/ who has returned here from
Port Arthur, was an â¢ eyewitness of
events there prior to his departure. He
lived at a Japanese hotel in Port Ar
thur and received the first warning of
the likelihood of hostilities from his
Japanese landlady on February 3, when
she declared that the Japanese had al
ready landed at Yinkow, and that an
other place soon would be taken. On
February 7 the Japanese began leaving
Port Arthur. Upon orders from Vice
roy Alexieff those remaining on Feb
ruary 9 were detained, about 100 of
them being held up at the hotel. ": -
The warships in* port had been
cleared of all wooden work on deck
on the 7th of February, but this had
not occasioned alarm. The people
were surprised to see flashes of fire
from the Golden Hill forts, but even
this did not suggest distrust.
" "I went to sleep that night," con
tinued M. Arkounin, "without realiz
ing that fighting was going on. The !
next morning I saw the battleship
Cesarevitch in the eastern basin of \
the harbor, near the dock, and the
battleship Retvizan at the entrance to
the harbor. They were apparently in

The town was still quiet and business
went on as before. The children went
to school, the banks and shops were
open and even New Chinatown, show

"At about 11 o'clock on the morn
ing of the 9th I again heard shots.
I proceeded at once, to the square and
found the people were panic stricken.
Chinese women and children were
running from their homes, glancing
anxiously behind them as they hur
riefa away. All the ships, banks and
other. places in town at once closed.
We could see two great columns of
smoke arising from one of the bat
teries, and thought they were due to
an explosion, but it was soon learned
that this smoke carne from the mor

"Suddenly the firing stopped and the
Japanese fleet began to steam away. It
was rumored about the town that an
explosion had occurred on board one of
the Japanese vessels.

Every energy of the authorities Is
now directed to prevent a blockade on
the Siberian railroad. Twenty new sid
ings, each 2200 feet in length, are being
erected. Owing to the heavy movement
of rolling stock carrying reinforce
ments, war munitions and commis
pariat stores eastward there is great
danger that in bringing back the empty
cars the whole line may be stopped.
With the sidings now being built the
authorities hope to be able to keep the
line clear and to send eleven trains' in
each direction daily.
Mail advices from Siberia say that
the army reserves from the rural dis
tricts seem to be much more anxious to
jjo to the front than the towsnmen.

It is c \ ident, even from the meager
information regarding the Russian dis
positions in Northern Korea, that the
Ii!an for checking the Japanese land

Talu River.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 3.â The
naval journal says the chief strategical
mission of the Russian fleet at Port Ar
thur is to prevent the Japanese landing
on the shores of the gulf of Llaotung,
thus protecting the right flank and rear
of the forces in Manchuria from the
Japanese army.
Since the disappearance of the Japa
nese fleet from before Port Arthur the
Russian authorities have been awaiting
anxiously the next move of the Japa
nese on the sea. There is an inclination
here to believe that the Japanese have
been discouraged by the failure of their
attacks and perhaps by losses they
have not announced.

SAN JOSE, March 3.â About sixty
Japanese laborers from the southern
section of the county walked In a body
to San Jose this morning, bearing the
Japanese and the American flags. Here
they boarded a train for San Francisco,
whence they will sail for Japan to en
list for the war.

The ice is breaking up in the Yalu
River. It is feared that trouble may
scon occur at Newchwang.
lessness is increasing and the pros
pects of a. famine are causing the in
habitants to seek safety in flight. They
realize it is hopeless to expect a suffi
cient supply of provisions. Many of
the refugees have arrived here.
The railway authorities declare that
the congestion on the lines caused by
the transport of troops prevents a
movement of provisions.
There is a good deal of speculation
as to these other visitors at the con
sulate. They were not seen outside the
building after their arrival.
Reports brought from Port Arthur
this morning say the population there
is in a state of extreme terror. Law-
Several mysterious visits have been
paid to this place at night by Japanese
torpedo boat destroyers. Men and of
ficers have come ashore, and, without
speaking to any one, have gone
Ftraight to the Japanese consulate.
The consulate iÂ« closely guarded. Since
last Thursday some sailors, survivors
of the torpedo boat sunk by Russians
in an attempt to blockade the harbor
at Port Arthur, have been taken away,
and with them went several other per
sons who had been at the consulate
for some days.
A steamship which has just arrived
here reports having seen a Japanese
battleship aground near Chemulpo.
The Russians did not attempt to pre
vent their landing. The activity of
the Russian troops in the neighbor
hood indicates, however, that they
trill endeavor to force the Japanese
to give battle. The Japanese appear
disinclined to fight at present, their
plans not being matured and their
forces not yet complete. Large num
bers of Japanese are on the way
from Chemulpo and other points close
to that base to Pingyang.
CHEF'J, March 3. â A dispatch from
Chemulpo says nine Japanese trans
ports have landed at Chinnampo 15,
00 0 men. with stores and munitions.
The men were sent on to Pingyang.
They have 'been sent from Chemulpo.
i WASHINGTON, March 3.â Minister
Â¦ Allen reported to the State Depart-
J inent from Seoul to-day by cable that
he had determined to send an Ameri
can ship to the vicinity of Pingyang
to remove to a place of safety the wo
men among the refugees gathered
there. The cruiser Cincinnati, which
is lying at Chemulpo, will bring away
these people.
NEW YORK, March 3.â In view of
the Washington press dispatches re
porting that Americans in Seoul and
vicinity had been sent to the Philip
pines by direction of United States Min
ister Allen, Dr. H. K. Carroll, one of
the corresponding secretaries of the
Missionary Society of the Methodist
Episcopal church, sent the following
dispatch to Secretary Hay:
"Have the missionaries in Korea been
ordered by United States Minister Al
len to Manila or elsewhere? I respect
fully ask in the interest of the Mission
ary Society of the Methodist Episcopal
Church."
Hay replied as follows: "Our mission
aries in Korea have been advised to
consult with Minister Allen, and when
practicable to follow his Instructions.
This Government does not assume to
order their movements, but in time of
war the legation's opportunities for
protection are limited by hostile move
ments and by difficulties of communi
cation, so that prudence is advisable,
having in view the safety of mission
aries and their families."

in closing the university temporarily
and in the, partial closing of "the tech
nological institute. The incident which
led to these results shows the excitable
nature of students of both sexes. â¢
More than 800 of the girls Joined a
few days ago in issuing an address of
loyalty. The remaining 167 young
women, who had not been consulted,
held a meeting after the address had
been sent In and protested, first, be
cause the address had been presented
in the name of the entire girl student
body, and. secondly, because the term
"pupil" Instead of "student" had been
used In the . wording.
The resentment of the 167 girls grew
as the meeting progressed, until there
developed an extravagant proposal to
send a message of congratulations to
the Mikado. It was finally resolved,
however, not to attend further lec
tures, and, the resolutions to thia end
having been transmitted to the direc
tors as unanimous action, the classes
were closed. This action, however, was
immediately rescinded when it was dis
covered that the resolutions did . not
emanate from the entire student body.
STORIES OP ROUGII ENCOUNTERS
In the meantime the recalcitrants had
aroused the sympathy of some of the
male students of the university, who
called a meeting. This ended in fac
tional disturbances and rough encoun
ters, with the result that the directors
temporarily closed the university on
account of the disorder.
Notice of the girls' protest having
been posted in the Men's Technical In
stitute the disgust of a Jewish student
was aroused, and he tore down the
document. A few hotheads rebuked
him for this act of intolerance, where
upon a quarrel arose, and the Jew
struck one of his opponents. Other
Jews joined in to defend their col
league. The stewards tried vainly to
separate the combatants, whereupon
both sides turned upon and fought the
stewards. When the fighting was over
the stewards resigned.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 3. â For
the first time since the emancipation
of the serfs in 1861 the anniversary
to-day was officially observed through
out the empire as a general holiday
and with special services in the
churches. â¢ The newspapers took oc
casion to review the reforms intro
duced by Czar Alexander III â who, by
a stroke of his pen, freed 23,000,000
serfs- â declaring that the present cel
ebration may be regarded as a turning
point In Russian history, marking the
recognition of a wider freedom in na
tional life, the realization of which Is
not far distant, provided the nation
properly exerts the influences that
have been so unexpectedly united by
the war.
At the big central market of St.
Petersburg thousands stood in the
open air, uncovered, joining in the
chanting of a te deum.
Several Russian sculptors have gone
to the Far East to model war types
on the spot. This is believed to be
the first attempt of the kind.
The Government takes the view that
the Japanese-Korean treaty is in di
rect contradiction to the Anglo-Jap
anese convention, the Russo-French
declaration and all preceding interna
tional agreements proclaiming Ko
rea's independence, and that, as it
was drawn up under duress, it cannot
have legal force.
The landing of 2500 Japanese at
Songchin, Korea, on February 19, re
ported by Major General Pflug, chief
of staff of Viceroy Alexieff, is believed
here to be the origin of the recent re

attempt to outflank the Russian ad
vance on the Yalu River.

The convention discussed many mat
ters of trade interest at its two ses
sions yesterday. The report of the ex
ecutive committee was taken up sec
tion by section, and its recommenda
tions for a progressive and aggressive
organization of the hardware trade was
adopted with few changes. It was de
cided to employ a salaried organizer,
whose duties shall be, as far as pos
sible, to enroll all the retail hardware
merchants in the State as members
of the association, with a view toward
mutual benefit and better business
methods. While the proposed Joint
meeting between the retailers and
wholsalers was not held, owing to lack
of time, the convention adjourned with
hearty expressions of good will and
harmeny towards the jobbing interest
and the declared purpose of co-opera
tion with the wholesalers' organization.
Fisher's Theater last night surren
dered to the association, more than 500
seats having been reserved for the
hardware men and . their women
friends. The programme abounded in
hits at all prominent members and cre
ated immense enthusiasm and laughter.
The leading actors received floral pres
ents in strict keeping with the char
acter of the occasion. t There were
flower pieces in the shape of nail kegs,
wash boilers,' coffee pots, coal scuttles
and other commodities dealt in by the
merchants, and the comedians gave
back no end of chaff in return for these
tributes of esteem.
Emphatic action against the bill now
before Congress for the establishment
of a parcels post was the most note
worthy step of general interest taken
at yesterday's meeting of the California
State Retail Hardware Association,
held at the California Hotel. An over
whelming majority of the members
present opposed the attempt to make
Uncle Sam a carrier of merchandise in
packages larger than he handles under
existing laws. They agreed in declar
ing that the bill, If.it should pass,
would work great injury not only to
the hardware trade, but to all lines of
merchandising in the State, by put
ting the local retailers at the mercy
of the great catalogue houses in the
larger cities.

There will be a recital on Wednesday
night, March 9, when "Julius Caesar"
will be given, and Saturday morning.
March 12, at 10:30 o'clock the third and
last recital will be "The Comedy of

Mrs. C. E. Grunsky introduced Dar
rach, who was accorded a flattering
reception before he began his recital,
and at the close he was given a hearty
verdict for his masterly Interpretation
of Shakespeare's remarkable play.
He took the five acts and imper
sonated each of the characters, with a
short explanation preceding each im
portant scene to make up for the lack
of stage accessories.
Mr. Darrach is powerful as an Inter
preter. He is Intelligible and easily fol
lowed, and this to the student of the
bard of Avon means much.
It was noticeable that besides the
members of the auxiliary there were
numerous juveniles in ' the audience,
some of whom had copies of Shake
speare and studiously followed the text
and Mr. Darrach.
"The Merchant of Venice" was the
flr3t of the three Shakespearean recitals

On leaving West Point Colonel Crow
der went into the Eighth Cavalry, since
which time' he has advanced to his
present high position. In 1895 he was
appointed judge advocate and went to
the Philippines as soon as the war
broke out. There he became an Asso
ciate Judge of the Supreme Court. He
was afterward made military secretary
under General E. S. Otis. He framed
the laws that were promulgated during
the military administration, and was
chief adviser in legal matters pertain
ing to the ownership of the different
properties on the islands. Colonel
Crowder's knowledge of the law was of
great value to the officials at the time
they were attempting to introduce the
civil government. Colonel Crowder was
the author of the Criminal Code, which
is still the code of the islands. In June,
1901, he was made brigadier general of
volunteers as a reward fd* his services.
Colonel Crowder continued to act as
judge advocate until the Philippine
Commission took full charge, on July
4, 1901, when he returned to this coun
try. He is now senior colonel of the
judge advocate's court in Washington.

Colonel Crowder was sent to investi

to the effect that while officers of the
British army were buying horses at
that point there had been no violation
of the neutrality laws. The incident

The new lawin regard , to the at
tachment of county employes' salaries
for debt is to ?be invoked here .next
Monday. During, the last campaign,'
when former County Clerk Frank G.
Jordan, now clerk of the 'Supreme
Court, was making his run for office,
he' Induced three of his deputies to in
dorse his note for' about $800, which
note he has been unable to meet. The
money was borrowed from the Bank'
of Hay wards, which has come down on
the deputies for the money.
The indorsers of the note were Frank
Mason, Charles Pugh and . Ray Baker,
employes in the County* Clerk's office.
Mason has since died, throwing the in
debtedness on Pugh and- Baker. They
have been putting off the payment of
the note in the hope that Jordan
would make the amount good ajt ' the
bank, but a short time ago the 4 bank
went into court and got a formal judg
ment against them for, $420 each. % To
day the judgment against them .was
filed under the provision of the new
law with County Auditor . Bacon," Â»vho
cannot audit their salaries until -the
claim is satisfied.
In the meantime, Jordan has made a
settlement of! enough of the claim to
satisfy, the" judgment - against Baker
and promises by Monday to have Pugh
clear, that being Â¦ pay day . with , ' the
county officials. The judgment, how
ever, at th<Â» nrpRpnt ttmÂ«> Hpk \r\ 'thft
Auditor's safe, waiting for a settlement
from one or the other source.

Colonel J. F. Hayes of the .Fifth
Regiment/ Captains df Police Wilson
and Petersen.and Colonel Handy of
the Governor's staff also spoke.
Mayor Olney, after complimenting
the members of Company _ A upon
their drill, said:
; I.was once a soldier, myself, and, while the
arms and : equipment of the soldier ' of Â¦ the
present day are a little different from the arms
and equipment used in ray time, still the sol
dier Is the same. The: same spirit that ani
mated I the defenders of â¢ the Â¦ country In : those
days should. and does animate the defenders of
the present day. ' The National Guard Is a
very Important part ; of - the defense ; of the
country. In time of war they, are called upon
to : perform . regular - duty. -- and I ) am afraid
that the true Importance of thfs service is not
always recognized: ; v Â¦ : : .
Tinder the new Federal law, through the
agency of which the .National Guards are sup
plied with arms and equipment, the State mili
tary organizations arc put upon practically, the
same footing as the regular "establishment. It
Is my desire that this should be so In every de.
tall, and tha* the various National Guard,or
ganizations, ,a this State should be as near
regulars as we can make. them. The National
Guard constitutes the reserve defense of this
country, and It is entitled to the moral support
of the people.

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
1118 Broadway, March 3.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
T. C. Lane, the Southern Pacific
switchman who drew a revolver upon
A. W. Baker, assistant superintendent
of the Western division of the So.uth
ern Pacific Company, and was arrested,
last night, did not make his appear
ance, before Justice of the Peace Geary
this morning, and one of his bondsmen
became very nervous over that fact.
Mrs. Marie de Mers, who is on the bond
with J. F. Baumgcrten, became anx
ious over the failure of Lane to appear
and she asked Justice Geary to release
her from the bond. Justice Geary ex
plained that the only way to accom
plisl. this was to surrender the de
fendant.
It is said, on the part of Lane, by
several of his friends, that he was told
by one of the deputies In the office of
District Attorney Allen that he would
not be needed until to-morrow, and
that this was the cause of his failure to
appear. . '
J. F. Baumgarten says he has not the
slightest fear that Lane will attempt
to Jump his bond. .
Lane says he got the worst of the
compromise - that he. made with the
company for. the loss of his arm, and
Assistant Superintendent Baker says
that he did not.
This Is what Lane says: "The South
ern Pacific Company agreed "to give me
a position that I could fill,' and it put
me at work in Tracy.. I was given the
work of a regular switchman to do, and
I did it to the satisfaction of the com
pany, but when I was paid, I was paid
the wages of a smiple flagman. If I
could . do the work of a switchman I
was entitled to the wages of a switch
man."
A. W. Baker, assistant superintendent,
upon whom the revolver was drawn,
said: "Lane was given the best posi
tion that we had vacant that he could
fill, and he was paid for the work done.
When he came into my office he had
been drinking, and we were not able to
find out just exactly what his com
plaint was. When we ordered him out
he drew the revolver and threatened
to shoot us all."
WILL TAKE REMAINS
BACK TO XATIVE STAVE
OAKLAND, March 3. â The body of
young 1 Charles Hasselkus, -who was
killed by a train at the Sixteenth
street depot last week, is on its way to
Toledo, Ohio, in charge of the broth
er-in-law of the deceased, L. G. Con
nor, who came here in answer to a
query by the Coroner as to what dis
position should be made of the re
mains. Connor started East with the
body this evening.
Connor said that the young man's
mother is prostrated over the affair
and she insisted on his coming to Cal
ifornia to learn how the accident oc
curred and bring the body home.
With some money received from his
father's estate Hasselkus bought a
piece of property at Rocky Ford,
Colo. He left there to go on a trip
to Seattle and evidently was making
his way cheaply to San Francisco
when he met with the accident which
caused his death.

IMPERIAL. Cal.. March 3. â The election on
the question of the lncorrwiratlon of Imperial
as a city of the sixth class resulted In prac
tically a unanimous vote for Incorporation.
City officers elected will qualify next Monday.
After listening to the testimony of Mrs.
Blanchard and arguments by Judge
A. F. Ft Sure for the defendant and
Attorney O. G. Heaton for the plaintiff,
Justice Tappan confessed that the
older he grew the less he knew about
corsets and. in what he affirmed would
be his last effort to reach a decision,
requested the attorneys to submit the
entire matter on briefs. In taking this
course, His Honor said:
"It appears from Mrs. Blanchard's
evidence here to-day that she refused
the corset because the 'spoons' did not
come up to her expectations. " Despite
the lack of 'spoons,' however, she stated
that the garment was a 'death trap,'
and I must eay that It is a vgry for
midable looking instrument. It has al
most as much steel in it as a Russian
battleship. The commercial world must
be protected and there is a question in
my mind as to whether Mrs. Blanchard
did not err in refusing to try on the
corset after Mrs. Eibes had built and
launched it. If it was constructed ac
cording to plans and specifications,
Mrs. Blanchard should pay for it. If
not I will have to determine just what
Mrs. Eibes is entitled to."
ALAMEDA, March 3. â Corsets were
again to the front in City Justice R.
B. Tappan's court to-day, when the
hearing of the action begun by Mrs. S.
E. Eibes to recover %1 DO from Mrs.
Francis Blanchard for a corset built
for the latter, was resumed. The de
fendant came armed -with one of the
whalebone garments, which she said
she had worn with comfort and which
she asserted was far superior to the
one made for her by the plaintiff and
which Mrs. Blanchard refused to ac
cept and referred to as a "death trap."
The result that is being aimed at is
to form an association of lumber deal
ers that will work in harmony with
an association of contractors. If this
is "brought about the contractors and
the dealers will not only be able to
control the prices of material, but also
the prices of labcrr.
G. R. Jameson of the Pacific Coast
Lumber Company explained the pro
posed association as follows:
"The association is not to raise the
price of material, but to equalize it.
There has been no understanding upon
rates for some time and .the prices
are now so low that there is no profit
in the business. There has been all
kinds of rate cutting, and what is be
ing aimed at is merely to establish a
uniform scale of prices, so that no one
(nan will get a better rate than an
other. â¢ We are looking toward protect
ing the members of our own business
as against unequal rate cutting, and
there is no intention of making any
arbitrary raise in rates."
This is what Hugh Hogan, who has
refused to go into the combine, says:
"There is no necessity for trying to
put prices up in any way and our com
pany will not enter any combine. The
wholesale price of lumber has gone
down and there is no reason why the
retail price should not go with it. I
understand that nearly all of the lum
ber dealers upon this side of the bay
have become parties to the agreement,
and they are trying to set an organ
ization of contractors to back them
up and to use no lumber except from
yards belonging to ! members of the
combine. Up to the present time they

tractors in this agreement."
The attempt being made to form a
combination of lumber dealers in this
city has been nearly though not en
tirely successful. Hugh Hogan of the
Humboldt Lumber Company is thQ
principal dealer standing out against
the combine. Mr. Hogan says the com
bine is out to raise the price of lum
ber, white those who have subscribed
to the agreement or understanding say
that 'it has been done merely to equal
ire prices and to keep some contrac
tors from getting better prices than
others.

She could see the dim outlines of a
man's form through the do<fr leading
jnto the kitchen, as he moved toward
the window to escape.
"If you stop I'll kill you," shouted the
woman again.
And a moment later the man had
hurried through the window. She could
see his retreating form going down the.
street.
Mrs. Hutton all the time was un
armed, there being nothing in the line
of firearms in. the house. She said to
day . that she was satisfied the man
had been thoroughly frightened by the
threats.
Mrs. Hutton was alone In the house
and asleep when she was awakened
about 11 o'clock by a noise on the lower
floor of the house. It sounded like the
breaking of glass and it was after
ward discovered that the intruder had
stumbled against a window and broken
it. The plucky woman crawled to the
head of the stairs as soon as she could
and -cried out:
"Who's there? Get " away or I'll
shoot." jJ-t

"We hope that the public will not
misunderstand the situation," said E.
A. Toung, proprietor of the Adeline
market. "This is not a fight on wages.
There is hardly a retailer in this city
who does not pay as much or more
than the ur#on scale. We have been
jammed to the wall by continued de
mands from the -union. This last de
mand, which has caused the trouble,
reads -'effective - March 1. .1904.' and
does not provide any time limit.. â¢ So
far as the agreement goe?, it gives us
not a particle of protectiqn against
more demands to-morrow. â¢
"We have organized to protect our
selves and have told the union that
unless it withdraws the boycott from
the Kohler and Rothamel shops we
shall lock out all union men. .The
wholesalers are behind us.
"We' had information that' a general
strike of the union was to be ordered
for Saturday morning, so we fore
stalled that somewhat by ordering this
lockout."
. The employing butchers' associa
tion officers are as follows: President,
O. G. Newhall: secretary, Fred Koh
ler; treasurer, Oscar Breiling; ser
geant at arms, Fred Kuhnle.
T. E. McGovern, business agent of
the union, said fo-iiight: "We were
told flatly to" quit 'the union or quit
our jobs. So far as the union is con
cerned, we. shall meet the situation in
our own way."
NOT A FIGHT OX WAGES.
The employing butchers' associa
tion Â» to-night at a meeting at Giers
Kail decided to notify those dealers
who have not yet joined the associa
tion that they would be given until 6
o'clock 'â¢ to-morrow night to sign the
roll, the alternative being that sup
plies would be cut off. A delegation
from the butchers' board of trade of
San Francisco, representing the
wholesale interests, attended the meet
ing and pledged its support to the
association. â¢ The. employers declare
they have organized for a fight to the
finish.
"The employers have decided they do
not want outsiders to run their busi
ness. It is not a matter of wages and
hours, at least so far as I. am con
cerned, for I have paid the rates now
demanded right along."
Neither union man nor employer
was willing to say how far the contest
might go. There is danger that the
wholesalers may be involved arid that
the slaughter-houses wjll be affected.'
Indications point to a hard fight. Some
of the large* dealers have started to find
non-union help.
Herman May,, district organizer for
the Pacific Coast of the International
Butchers', and Sausage Makers' Union,
has'taken-charge of" the situation. He
announced that the local union Avould
be supported by the international body.
Fred Becker,' the largest employer in
the city, said:
"We have been -locked but because we
have made a demand for- more wages
and less working hours. Our demands
have the ., official indorsement of the
councils with which we are affiliated."
At this time the situation- is somewhat
involved owing .to the calling of th-2
lockout, and we are not prepared to
say- what will be done."
Makers' executive board, by the Pack
ing Trades' Council and by the Ala
meaa County Federated Trades.
As soon as the lockout had been de
clared a special meeting of the Butch
ers' Union was called. T. E. McGovern,
the .union's; business agent, "made the
following statement: 4'
This demand* the union declares, has
been indorsed by the International
Journeymen Butchers' and Sausage
Behind the contest stand the.whole
sale supply firms. Union men declare
that the retailers have been forced to
declare a lockout by the wholesalers. It
is said that the supply houses have
agreed to protect their retailing
patrons, who have organized to resist
the union's demands.
The agreement presented to the- em
ployers provides an increase from $16 to
$18 a week in meat cutters' wages; a
reduction to ten hours as a day's work
for sausagemakers; boys to work only
as cash boys; apprentices limited, to
youths of 18 years of age, at a mini
mum of $10 a week. There are also
other points relating to working condi
tions included. Â¦
BUTCHERS HOLD MEETING.
The lockout came as a great surprise
to the union. The leaders had not ex
pected the employers to take this step.
It had been believed that a strike would
be ordered, however, and the employers
took the offensive side of the contest,
placing the men on the defensive.
The employers met and decided to re
sist the strike, by ordering fl. general
lockout, to De effective to-day, unless
the strike should be declared ' off and
the pickets withdrawn. In pursuance of
the decision every union butcher with
the exception of" a few employed in
shops th&t signed the agreement was
notified before noon to-day that his ser
vices were no longer required. The ma
jority of the shops notified their men
when they appeared for work. At Beck
er's, Washington street, near Eighth,
where nearly fifty meat cutters". were
employed, the lockout was effective at
noon.
This was the employers' reply to the
union's demands.
OAKLAND, March: 3.-â Refusal
of the employing butchers, of
this city to sign a new wage and
hours schedule presented by the Jour
neymen Butchers* Union; followed , by
a strike in two meat markets of union
meat cutters, has led. to a lockout of
union .butchers. Two hundred men are
involved and nearly every meat mar
ket in Oakland, Berkeley and Alameda
has been affected. Employers in the
large shops declared that the fight is
not centered on the wage schedule, but
is a question, with thenvof recognition
of the union.
For ten days the situation has been
working to a crisis. Soon after the
union made known its demands the
employers met and decided that they
would not sign the " new. " agreement,
though Fred Becker, the largest em
ployer, said that he had been paying
the new rate demanded for a long time ;
but he declined to sign the agreement
because it forced him into recognition
of the Butchers' Union. This position
was taken by all but a few of the em
ployers.
The union yesterday forced the issue,
by calling a strike in Kohler Bros, and
G. A. Rothamel's ; markets because
these employers had refused to sign
the new agreement. The first named
firm conducts the Buffalo Market at
Twenty-second street and San Pablo
avenue and the Excelsior Market at
Twenty-fourth street and Telegraph
avenuo. Rothamel's shop is the Pa
cific Market at Twentieth street and
Telegraph avenue. These shops were
declared "unfair," and pickets were sta
tioned in front of them to announce a
boycott. \

allowing the deadly monoxide to flow
freely from the hose. Mrs. Crawford
had, to all appearances, returned to bed
wth her clothes on, to lie down after
she had lit the gas stove. While there
she fell asleep and was asphyxiated.
At about 10 a. m. yesterday Miss
Viola Presho. the landlady's daugh
ter, went to Mrs. Crawford's room to
arouse her, and merely pushing the
door open enough to see into the room
saw her lying on the bed, and supposed
she was awake. Later in the day Mrs.
Kate Roberts, a roomer in the same
house, smelled the gas and Miss Presho
went to the room and then found that
the aged woman was dead.
Mrs. Crawford was the divorced wife
of C. P. Crawford, a mining man of
Salt Lake City. She formerly lived on
Duquesno avenue. Allegheny City, Pa.,
and in Denver. Colo. She is supposed
to have been slightly demented. Nu
merous letters in regard to
a supposed buried treasure near
St. Petersburg, at a place known
as Lone Oak, on Tampa Bay,
Fla., were found in her room. She also
had a number of plats and diagrams of
the ground in the vicinity of the place
where the treasure she expected to find
was supposed to have been buried in
early days by the crew of a pirate
ship, which was wrecked on the north
shore of Tampa Bay. Among the dead
woman's effects was a large package of
letters from clairvoyants, mediums and
spiritualists, directing her how to gain
access to the burled treasure which she
sought to recover.

Unfortunate speculations supply the
sole explanation for Mellen L. Doe's
failure. He was concerned in mining
stocks and also in Eastern invest
ments. In addition to the creditors
named in the foregoing, the schedule
discloses that there is owing to J.E.,
yr. H. and J. C. Adams $5257. The
Adamses are the owners of the Adams
building on Sutter street. There is
due to J. B. Bocarde $2820; to J.
Knowland $4860, E. Kittredge & Co.
$656; F. M. Smith of Elmhurst, $362;
S. H. Smith of Monterey, $1100; M.
Lewis, $500; Mutual Life Insurance

$1092; and to L. Kaufman and J. R.
Smith, $100 in total.
The indebtedness that is included
in the schedule filed yesterday with
the petition in bankruptcy is old, and
consists principally of borrowed
money. The notes evidencing most
of the debt have been renewed from
time to time. Among the debts was
one for margins on stocks purchased
by a broker. Some time ago an offer
was made by Mellen L. Doe's attorney
for a settlement of this claim. The
proposition was not accepted. Friends
of Mellen L. Doe say that this refusal
might have been due to a belief that
family ' pride would be too strong to
permit Mellen L. Doe to come into
court as a voluntary bankrupt; that
other members of the family would
prevent it.
Mellen L. Doe has, however, disap
pointed this expectation, if it ever
really existed. Had the petition in
bankruptcy been filed on the day be
fore Charles F. Doe died, the legacy
of $40,000 would not have been in
cluded in the assets and Mellen L.
Doe would have been cleared of his
indebtedness. The estimate of the
value of the legacy is based on the
fact that Mellen L. Doe inherited by
the will of Charles F. Doe two per
cent of an estate that is worth about
$2,000,000. Of this share one per
cent is payable at once and the other
one per cent, or $20,000, at the dis
cretion of the trustees. It was said
yesterday that by sacrificing his leg
acy to his creditors, Mellen L. Doe will
have little left.
Mellen L. Doe. formerly a member
of the firm of Charles F. Doe & Co.
of this city, filed a petition in bank
ruptcy in the United States District

THEY ACTUALLY
DO THE WORK
Food Eaten IÂ« Wortlilcss Unless Di-
gestedâ Some Stomachs Must
Have Heli>.
Food trtken into the Etomach which,
from the nature of the food or the con-
dition of the stomach. Is not digested
is worse than no food at all. Thi3 is
a truÂ« statement as far as it goes, and
a great many dyspeptics go only this
far with their reasoning. They argue
%vith themselves that because their
stomachs do not do the work given
them they must be given less work; in
other words, they must be starved. It
wÂ«u!d be just as sensible for a busi-
ness man who is unable to do all his
<rvrn work to cut down his business to
his own capacity as it is for a man
to starve himself to relieve his stom-
ach. The sensible business man em-
ploys help and goes forward With his
business. Likewise the sensible dys-
peptic will employ help for his stom-
ach and give his body proper nourish-
ment.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets actually
do the work assigned to them. They
relieve weak and overburdened stom-
achs of a great portion of . digestive
action. Thefr component parts are
Identical with those of the digestive
fluids and secretions of the stomach
and they simply take up the grind and
carry on the work just the game as a
pood, strong, healthy stomach would
do it.
. On this account Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are perfectly natural in their
action and effects. They do not cause
any unnatural or violent disturbance
In the stomach or bowels. They them-
selves digest the food and supply the
system with all the nourishment con-
tained in what is eaten and carry out
nature's plans for the sustenance and
maintenance of the body.
How much more sensible Is this
method than that employed by many
sufferers from weak stomachs. By this
means body and brain get all the good,
nutritious food they need and the man
is properly nourished and equipped to
carry on his work and perform his du-
ties. He could not possibly be In proper
working condition by starving himself
or employing some new fangled. In-
sufficient food that does not contain
enough nutriment for a year-old baby.
A strong man doing strong work must
be properly fed, and this applies to the
brain as well as the body.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets by reliev-
ing the Etomach erf its work enable It
to recuperate and regain its normal
health and strength. Nature repairs
the xvorn and wasted tissues just as !
f he heals and knits the bone of a brok-
en limb, which is of course not used
during the process of repair.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
pale by all druggists at 50 cents a box
and thev are the one article that the
druggist docs not try to sell something
In the place of that's "Just as good."
â¢Their unqualified merit and success and
the universal demand for them has
placed them within the reach of every I
oae.

with provisions contributed by Ameri
cans for the relief of the distressed. The
Conemaugh. the vessel Inquired about,
left . Philadelphia April 23. 1S92. and
landed her cargo at Riga.
Washington seems to consider the incident closed
since Russia has expressed her conviction that the com
mander of :the Yicksburg did not shock the world by
conduct that would have' outraged an Apache's sense, of
humanity. Washington is too easily satisfied. Let

TO PREVENT FLOODS'
In- a dispatch; not long enough to give a mediocre
prize-fighter an opportunity to express his preliminary
opinion of himself, we received a few days since the in
formation .that hundreds of Chinese had been drowned
in floods that swept the land. Observers took no note
of how many hundreds nor of the conditions of -this
great disaster. It depends upon/ whom you are for .the
world to care whether you live or die. .
GOVERNOR PARDEE has observed. the present
floods in the Sacramento River;. and has reached
: conclusions as to their cause. No doubt the re
clamation of large islands in the Sacramento has had the
effect of narrowing the stream, so' that V its- outflow, is
choked. This prevents the rapid escape of flood waters
into Suisun Bay, raises the level of the mid-stream :
overflows'the 4evees just-below Sacramento.''- * j, : r
One remedy, which webelieye. is 'indorsed by- engi
neers, is to draw off the : flood Waters into Yolo basin, and
discharge them below the engorgement, ,'lf '" haVVaiso
been' proposed to cut'a canal through "orieVof the large

"Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I see
in your morning's paper an article
from Herbert George of the Citizens'
Alliance <tf Denver, stating that
through the efforts and work of the
Citizens* Alliance industrial peace now
reigns in Colorado. I want to say that
Mr. George's statement Is not true; that
articles in your own papers go to show
there is still industrial war in Colo
rado; that the industries of the entire
State are paralyzed. The smelter in
dustry as well as the coal Industry
and the mining industry are completely
tied up. .Thousands of men are out
of employment. Business house after
business house has been compelled to
close its doors. During the last thirty
days two of the largest supply houses
in Victor, Colo., have gone out of busi
ness and most of the small stores have
closed their doors in the Cripple Creek
district.
"This is on account of the Citizens'
Alliance being organized in that camp,
and the unions establishing their co
operative stores are doing the busi
ness of the Cripple Creek district. This
state of affairs that exists in Colorado
has been brought about to a great ex
tent by the business men following
Mr. George's tactics. I want to say to
the citizens of Calif ornia that If they
want to avoid the conditions that exist
in Colorado they want to refrain from
following Mr. George,^ as he will cer
tainly create an industrial war here
the same as they have in Colorado if
his tactics are used. Although Mr.
George says that everything is pros
perous In Colorado, I know it to be
the reverseâ that the entire busi
ness of the State is paralyzedâ and I
know whereof I 'speak, as I am an old
citizen of Colorado, have been In busi
ness in Colorado and am recently from
there, and' I ! would advise the citizens
of San Francisco If they "want to con

Just as a number of prominent at
torneys were entering & restaurant a
few days 'ago they were approached
by a seedy old man, whose appearance
indicated that .-his bedraggled condi
tion was due to Indulgence in drink.
All the' attorneys spoke to him* and
quickened their "steps, -knowing
through long experience that the old
man would ask them for money,
which, if forthcoming, he invariably
spent for liquor. The old man's eyes
glistened when he saw the attorneys
trying to get away from him and a
look of shame came on his face. Then
he smiled, for one of the lawyers, one
of the oldest and most prominent in
town, stopped, turned, spoke pleas
antly and shook hands with him,
leaving a half-dollar in the shaking
palm.
"I can never/ pass the old man by."
said the attorney when he Joined his
companions. "He gave me a little
advice twenty-five years ago that
went a long way toward help
ing me along. It was just after
I had been admitted to practice, when
he was in his prime and as sober and
smart a man as could be found in a
day's journey. One day I won a par
ticularly hard case, and went with my
client into a saloon to get a drink in
celebration of the victory. The old
man, who was present in court when
the jury gave the verdict for which
I had fought so hard, saw me coming
out. He called me to one side, put
his hand on my shoulder' and in a
fatherly way said:
" 'Youngster, it's in you to win many
a verdict, but you want to keep away
from saloons.' "

WITH all that has been and is being printed about
the Russo-Japanese war it is surprising how
widespread is the ignorance of the causes that
led up to the present trouble or of the beginning 1 and the
long duration of the bitter struggle between China and
Russia for the possession and control of Manchuria. ;
Dalny, for instance, is continually figuring in the war
dispatches. How man)' know the remarkable history of
Dalny; how it was built almost in a day, as it were, by

of the present intrigue. And how many know why, after
building such a splendid seaport at the very entrance of
the broad domains he has been striving so long to ab
sorb, the Russian Emperor left Dalny absolutely unforti
fied by either naval or military forces until the first blow
had been struck by Japan.- All of this is interesting read
ing, which the Sunday Call Magazine presents in authen
tic detail next Sunday. Indeed it throws many entertain
ing side lights on the present strife.
And in view of the oft repeated prediction of the pos
sibility of the other European powers, England particu
larly, becoming involved in war, the Sunday Call pre
sents an article by the Earl of Meatb, wherein he gives
some startling facts about the deterioration of British
health and physique, and some equally, impressive com
parisons with the men and women of other nations.
Coming from one so widely known as the Earl of Meath
this article at this time has a peculiar significance.
One of the most exasperating difficulties about follow
ing the war news is the uncertainty about the correct pro
nunciation of the Chinese and Japanese, names. The
handy Japanese glossary on the new scrap-book page in
the next Sunday Call is designed particularly to help the
bewildered reader. * And by the way there are many
other : timely and unique features on that same scrap-

Of all the classes of Cossacks the
most interesting are those of the Don,
whose importance is such that they
are much better paid than the ordi
nary soldier, and are, allowed much
more freedom and their towns a cer
tain degree of independence.
During the time that Southern Rus
sia was infested by the Tartar hordes
they lived as "free settlers," carrying
on a nomadic marauding warfare j
against the tribes of the great khan.
At the first they practiced celibacy and
recruited their ranks from the outlaws
of Moscow and Northern Russia. At
that time they did no agricultural work
or cattle raising. In fact, death was (
the penalty for following such pursuits, i
They depended entirely on raiding the
Tartar's flocks and herds and did not
always restrict themselves to these, but
often carried off the prettiest of the
maidens, which accounts for the slight
mixture of Tartar blood in the present
Cossacks.
Later when raiding became less
profitable they made use of the im
migrants and runaway serfs from the
north for raising agricultural pro
ducts, while they themselves lived by
aristocratic occupations such as flsh
ing. hunting and cattle breeding. So
cially they were all equal. Any one
could hold office, and at the expira
tion of his term he would cheerfully
return to the rank of ordinary Cos
sack. As the number of inhabitants
increased, however, they were gradu
ally forced to agricultural pursuits.
At first every one plowed and sowed
where he pleased, changing his loca
tion whenever the soil became ex
haustefl. Later the richer and more
enterprising began not only to culti
vate, but to appropriate large sections
of land. Out of this so many disputes
arose between the rich and the poor
that at last the commune, which still
held to the old ideas of equality, con
fiscated all the land and inaugurated
a system of distribution which, with
some slight changes, is still used.
The liberties of self government
which they formerly possessed have
been gradually curtailed, and some of
the offices have become hereditary,
but etill they enjoy many democratic
privileges which the Czar dare not
take away from them, for they are
his strongest military force. When in
active service for the Government they
receive much larger wages than the
ordinary Russian Cossack- A colonel
with whom we traveled for some
lime received 3000 rubles ($1500) a
year.
My first personal acquaintance with
the Cossacks of the Don was at Teil
ingr, in Manchuria, where the colonef
of the Cossack regiment, stationed
along the southern section of the
Chinese Eastern Railroad, had his
headquarters. The little settlement of
bngineers and Cossacks is located two
miles outside of the Chinese city of
Teiliiig, and consists of several long
one storied brick houses with straw
.Ihatched roofs, arranged around a
central court. Near by are . the bar
racks where the Cossacks and their
t inilies live. The stables are adjoin
ing and too near the living rooms to
suit Â¦ me, but as the Cossack and his
horse are one it probably does not
disturb him.
There was a general bakery, where
we were able to buy some large round
loaves of black bread to help out our
Chinese diet as we proceeded on our
way across Manchuria. At the gen
eral store, which provided, for the Cos
sacks and engineers, you could buy
California canned fruits, Crimean
wine, American beer and cigarettes,
while a small stand near by retailed
"quass," a beer used by the Russian
peisantÂ«.
In front of the Cossack barracks
there were several primitive devices
for amusement. The principal one
was a high pole surmounted by a
Email wheel, to which a number of
ropes were attached so that the boys
and others could swing round and
rotlbd. There were also several rope
swings scattered around . the grounds
for the children. These two features
were, to be seen in every Cossack
settlement. In one place, in addition
to these, there was a merry-go-Vound.

The Kuss'.an army is composed of
two principal elements, the ordinary
soldier, recruited from the peasants,
and the Cossacks of the Don. The
larger part of the soldiers guarding
the Chinese Eastern Railroad in Man
churia belong to the Cossacks of the
Don, who form a very interesting and
exceedingly effectiv.e army. Before the
completion of the Chinese Eastern Rail
road I had the pleasure of coming In
close contact with these Cossacks,
sleeping with them, eating black bread
with them, and talking with them in
broken language, illustrated by ges
tures.

American sympathy is guided by intelligent compre
hension of American interests. All that we have ex
pected or had the right to expect was free competition
for Chinese trade. We do not propagate our commerce
with armies nor promote it with gunpowder. ; We have
no desire to forcibly monopolize international /markets.
If we gain their control it .is by the quality and. price of
our products. , Russia's policy, is different. It is offensive.
It is monopoly secured by "guile and guarded by armies.
She is using a page out of the history of Napoleonic am
bition. Give her the mastery of the five hundred millions
of people in Eastern Asia, for which she is now fighting, 1
"and she will control the world.,
- Napoleon thought lie. had achieved that control when
he issued the Berlin decree, forbidding all nations the
right to trade with Great Britain, and threatening them
with the vengeance of France if they disobeyed him. It
was a high ambition and a majestic defiance, but he
lacked the power to enforce, it. Give Russia the power
she is seeking and she can issue a decree from St." Pe
tersburg that will stop the wheels and draw the fires in
two-thirds Of' the ;mills of ( the United States,; and disuse
the labor of millions of Americans.- " : ' :: " r - v"*: ' â¢ '
.It may be said by an optimist, "If that is "done* \ve will
defend ourselves by. war.". Yes, war with a power.. that
will control nearly half the population and two-thirds of
the natural resources of the planet; that will occupy a
â¢ practically. invulnerable continental position, with no out
posts that- can be struck at, and with internal lines of
communication that we cannot reach. To the far-sighted
it is now apparent that it is not well fpr the world. to have
one master. If that come, even the short-sighted will be
made to understand. ....
ij Consul Miller says that our trade has disappeared.and
one looks in vain through "the markets of that city of
120,000 people for an article of American, manufacture.
Even American beer, once largely imported to that part
of China, has been crowded out. It is an agricultural
region, and formerly our farm machinery was growing'in
use. Now it is taboo, with the rest* of our manufactures.
Our primacy of the Pacific;is a vain thing if Eastern
Asia is to be v closed against us. We cannot hope for
much commerce with French Indo-China, nor the Straits
Settlements, nor farther or hither India. In all those
regions we have been preceded by European influence,
which controls everything. Our commercial hopes were
centered in China, in all of China, not as a Russian de
pendency, monopolized by the Muscovite, but as an au
tonomous empire. Now that the first point penetrated by
our commerce is closed against us by-Russia, we have a
foretaste of what will happen if the Czar is victorious
over Japan. . . - Â¦
A great deal of loose talk is indulged in about our fel
lowship with Great Britain, in our Oriental policy.
There is no alliance with Great Britain nor will there be.
It is unnecessary. It suffices for us to know that"wherev
er Great Britain is, in Eastern Asia, there is an opeYi door
for trade, which is all we ask. In that respect the policy
of Russia is the exact antithesis of that of Great Britain.
Russia means the closed door, and closed* expressly
against us. For evidence of this, Manchuria and Harbin
are sufficient.
. Our access to China is natural. It is by water to her
coasts and by water up her great rivers, touching all the
possible termini of railroads on those streams. The ac
cess of Russia is artificial, by railway over a long and
costly transit. The difference yi cost, of transportation
alone gives us a natural advantage, but this is nullified
by the processes described by Consul Miller. In the day
of their construction our transcontinental railways were
the longest in the world, but they were- not used to ob
struct international trade. Russia uses -her trans-Siberian
road as an obstruction instead of a facility, and it is a
factor in working out her political ambition to become
the mistress of" the. world, through her primacy of China
and the subjugation of Korea' and Japan. 7.
We are now acting as trustee of the world's commerce
in digging the Panama canal. It was expected that it
would supply, a facility, for . our own commerce with
China, and would enhance our interest in the Pacific to
an extent justifying the cost of that great work. If we
get what we expect out of it, with Russia's Manchurian
policy applied to all Eastern Asia, we would like to know
how it is to be done.' . -^'^ Y
All of these thjngs are clearly comprehended at Wash
ington. Secretary Hay was acting in the interest of Amer
ican commerce and prosperity when he secured the as
sent of Europe to the open doo: in China, and his recent
note to secure the independence and sovereignty of China
is a necessary sequence of his open door idea. The ad
ministration at Washington is placed in a very difficult
position by Russia. The benefit of all that has happened
since 1898 hangs upon the victory of Japan. If she win,
our trade is safe, our sacrifices are justified and the Pa
nama canal is worth its cost. If she lose, we lose.
TH E "report of j M r. American Consul at the
Russian city, of Harbin, . in' Manchuria, discloses
. commercial conditions-' that are :. not^reassuring \ to
Americans. Our expectations of . trade have centered in
Manchuria and North China. The resources of Man
churia are very great, and their development implies im
portant commercial exchanges." When* we achieved bur
position in the. Pacific we had the right to assume 'that we
would have free, access to our. share of these exchanges.
But, taking advantage of the Boxer war to occupy Man
churia with a- great army, Russia has practically closed
the whole province against us. '< .
. He, was seated^ at an open window
one. day ". when an Italian vender
passed the house with a string of toy
balloons. The little fellow watched
him with a wistful eye, and his
mother, noting his interest in the toys,
asked him if . he would like one of
them. An affirmative answer sent
her hurrying to the front door to call
back the Italian.
The balloon afforded great.amuse
ment to the child for a time and made
him forget his pain. Finally he got
tired of it and became drowsy.- The
thread slipped through his finger and
the balloon shot out of the window.
Quietly he watched with wondering
eyes its UDward course, and when it
had disappeared from view he turned
to his mother and cheerfully lisped,
"It's don to Dod. mamma." He'll mind
it for me. won't he?"
His mother, pleased; that he had
taken his loss so uncomplainingly,
did not disturb his childish belief and
promised to buy him another balloon
when next the vender called around.
That night the little fellow was at

the family physician, who had been
hurriedly summoned, could hold out
no hope to the grief-stricken parents.
Just as day was- dawning. he began to
sink rapidly* and the poor mother, in
consolable in her grief, threw her
self on the bed beside him. Hearing
the half-suppressed sobs of the
mother he feebly extended his little
hand until it caressed her neck.

whispered. "I'm going to get my bal

and papa are."

Physicians had told them that he
would never be strong or healthy, but
they sought to console themselves
with the belief that the men of
science were mistaken and that their

TRADE IN MANCHURIA.
In the past history, of Russia the Cos-
Backs of the Don have Played .a most
important part, and in^he present war
the; Japanese will find an army com
posed of Cossacks of , the ; Don vastly
different from any Chinese army which
they have ever faced. â¢ * These Cossacks
were .bornf fighters// and gxew^up In , an
atmosphere impregnated with the spirit
In all our dealings with the Cossacku
of the Don we found them very kind
and sociable. .However, I presume that,
like the gypsies, in "loving and hating
their passions are Â¦ strong.'.' and that
when in their company It is well to keep
on friendly terms with them. Their
history has not' been such as always
to develop the, gentler traits of char
acter, and yet one cannot but be at
tracted by them.
Cossacks had their "families with them.
However, in seme of the more perm
anent quarters many of tbetr .families*
are found.
A close inspection of the small pict
ures revealed the fact that they were
all celebrated American stage beauties
collected from packages of American :
cigarettes. In a . corner of .-the room
was the. omnipresent accordion, which
furnished all kinds of music, from the
grand national hymn .to the liveliest
kind of Jigs for their clog dances.
Every one seems to be able to play the
accordion, yet they have their recog
nized artists, who provide most of the
music. Many of their folk songs which
we heard 'were very effective, especially
as you. cannot help but enter into the
enthusiasm of the singers.
On the shores of Lake, Baikal we met
several thousand of these Cossacks on
their way to Manchuria, and just r.t
sunset a regiment of 1500 men. lined up
in front of a precipitous cliff and ren
dered their I evenlns^chant g "Although
the Iine?was'over.v260 ? yards long there
was no wavering in the time from one
end to' the other and the effect was
sublime. After the evening chant the
men divided into* general groups, the
smaller of which was gathered around
an accordion, which played for all kind
of dances. But the larger crowd gath
ered around a 'group of 'singers, who
rendered a number of folk songs, a style
of music In which the Russian nation
is exceedingly rich. * After , one group
had. sung, from twenty^inutes to half
an hour* another group' would start and
sing about the same length of time.
Few of the songs were repeated, and
most of them formed a sort of round
with a large number of verses. I have
never heard a college glee. club sing In
better unison or with as good expres
sion as did. these improvised glee clubs
formed among the soldiers. Â¦ '. >
For all these services they did riot
expect fees, and in fact flatly refused
them. One of our guards even went
so far as to treat us. After such at
tentions as these we were totally un-.
prepared for the demands for fees
which the Chinese guards, whom we
had later, made on us. These latter
were absolutely useless as guards or
guides, and yet at the end of the day
calmly presented their bill as if they
had not been paid for their services
by the Government. The character of
the Chinese soldier and the Cossack
is reflected in their dress. One has
flowing robes and long fingernails,
while the other is dressed in coarse
blouse and trousers, with heavy knee
boots, and has calloused hands.
At every camp we would take out
our map and show the Cossacks where
we came from and where we were go
ing. Then we would point out the Don
River and read the names of some of
-the towns along there. This always
drew a crowd," and they would trace
the course by which they came from,
the rich valley of tfie Don to Odessa,
and from there by boat through the
Bosphorus and the Suez canal, around
India and up to Port Arthur, in Man
churia or the beautiful harbor of Vlad
ivostok. They were' certain that there
was no place in the world like the val
ley of the Don. And.it surely is one
of the most fertile, prosperous and at
tractive sections in Russia.
Some of their quarters were very in
teresting, and strongly re*friinded me
of a typical American . college boys
room, but on a cheaper scale. Chromos,
Chinese wall pictures, groups of*cigar
ette pictures, swords and guns were
profusely hung around on the walls.
Over one of the old-fashioned pictures
of a naval battle a dirty towel was
carefully draped, while in the window
were some plants. Beds and chests
filled most of the room, so that chairs
were not needed. The generally con
futed order and haphazard arrange
ment of things bespoke the "lack of
woman's nursing," for none of these

as we followed the line of uncomplet

they could relay from station to sta

Don who' acted as our guards very
thoughtful of our wants. They would
drive ahead and pick out the best road
for our Chinese carts, which is an im
portant matter, for the roads are "ex
tremely, indefinite, varying ' in width
from six 1 feet to one-half mile. They
would also drive off the dogs, which is
no small service, and keep the beggars
at a respectful distance. At one time
we saw them in their element. A
number of Chinese bandits attacked
a baggage train Just ahead of us.
which was guarded by four Cossacks.
At first the Cossacks' horses were
stampeded by the sudden, unexpected
attack, but reinforced by our two
guards, they fixed bayonets, and by
charging the Chinese easily routed
them.

I The capacity of the" lower' reaches of the Sacramento
can be increased by, other means than sending its floods
into the San Joaquin. It is possible to do this by a
drainage channel cut in the main shore on the. north.
When the present flood subsiaes and the losses caused
l>y it are ascertained, the owners of the lands to be bene
fited by these corrective measures can estimate the con
tribution they can afford to make to secure safety, in" the
future. Then it will be'seen that the losses inflicted by
one flood are almost sufficient to secure permanent pro
tection, if their amount.be diverted to that purpose. ,
One thing is sure, as a matter of legal right, that pro
tective measures must be, in part at least, at the expense
of those who will be benefited by them, and not, as in the
case of a south side discharge, at the cost of those who
will be injured. The reclamations on the south side of
the San Joaquin are as important and valuable as those
that obstruct the Sacramento, and they have the great
advantage of leaving the main river as free as it always
was, thus causing no damage to any land anywhere. Un
der, such circumstances they must be considered in all
plans for throwing the more dangerous river over into
the channel of the one that is harmless".'
The present floods offer a splendid opportunity for the
study of cause and remedy. Of this engineers will, no

statuary marble, having ornamental
solid bronze doors, and adorned with
decorative paintings which Btand for
literature, the fine arts, science and
labor, the building is literally a crea
tion of beauty. The furniture" is
wholly of mahogany and was 'specially
designed. Every convenience for the
operation of the library and for the
comfort of its patrons that refined
taste and ample means could suggest
has been provided. The book stacks
are intended to hold 30,000 volumes.
The acceptance of this- gift by the
city of Chicago as a branch library
marks the beginning of a new feature
of library administration in that city.
Thus' far Chicago has be'en content
to rely wholly, for the outlying distri
bution of books upon delivery stations.
Books are not kept at these stations.
The stations are solely for the delivery
and exchange of the volumes which
are ordered by title from the main
library. <
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
3.â On April 10 President David Starr
Jordan will take personal charge of
the marine exploration party that is
now working on the California coast
under the direction of Professor Rit
ter of the University of California.
The work of the expedition will be
to make a thorough investigation of
the sunken. canyons found along the
coast and to determine the nature of
whatever forms of life that may be
.found in them.: An especially close
study will be made of Monterey Bay,
and some considerable time will be
spent in investigating Santa Monica
Bay. The steamer being used for the
expedition is the United States Fish
Commission ship Albatross.
Dr. Jordan will be accompanied by
Professors C. H. Gilbert and H. Heat"h
of the ' zoology department and . M. H.
Spaulding, '03, a graduate student in
zoology. The work of the expedition
is expected to last until August, when
a complete report Â»of the work done
will be forwarded to Washington. :
by the Bakersfield public library are
a score of volumes upon musical topic3.
The selections were made by the presi
dent of the Thursday Music Club and
are primarily for use by the membeia
of that organization in their studies.
The Carnegie library building In Eu
reka is now finished, but cannot h:;
opened for use till a sufficient sum of
money is raised for the furniture and
equipment.
Nevada City, Redwood City and Hay
wards have each been favored during
the past week with gifts of $10,000 for
library buildings from Andrew Carne
gie. Nevada City is, with the excep
tion of Redding, the first mining town
in California to receive a Carnegie do
nation.
The Woman's Shakespeare Club of
Xevada City has been prompt to recog
nize this service to their city by pass
ing' appropriate resolutions and for
warding a copy of them with a tender
of their thanks to Mr. Carnegie.
The city of Lewiston, Idaho, has
placed its Carnegie library building in
a conspicuous part of the public park,
fronting on the new boulevard. ThÂ»Â».
location chosen gives general satisfac
tion. The building will be of brick,
having one story and a basement to be
finished hereafter.
The city authorities of Wilbur, near
Spokane, "Waeh., were recently treated
to an agreeable surprise. Judge "E. A.
Hesseltine, one of the citizens of Wil
bur, appeared before the City Council
and offered to found a public library*
upon the conditions that the city should
provide a suitable place for the keep
ing of the books and arrange for their
proper care.
By the earnest efforts of the. women
in Astoria, Or., who have long sup
ported a free library by collecting
monthly subscriptions, the City Coun
cil has been induced to levy half a mill
tax for maintenance of the library dur
ing the next year.
Salt Lake City received an offer
more than four years ago from John
Q. Packard, a mining man possessing
large interests In Utah and California,
of a library building to be erected
within fire years, to cost not less than
$75,000. He also promised to give
a site on State street for this building,
for which site he had paid $20,000.
The sole condition of acceptance re
quired from the city was the perpet
ual maintenance of the library. Plans
are now being made for a two-story
stone structure. The library rooms
Trill be on the first floor and on the
second floor will be a hall capable of
seating 500 people.
A novel gift lately made to the
public library of Omaha, Neb., shows
the widespread and constantly in
creasing belief in general educa
tional, value of public libraries. Such
education comes not alone through
books, but in many other and diversi
fied ways.
The gift Is a herbarium containing
2200 species belonging to 800 genera
of native plants that were collected
by the donor, "William Cleburne, dur-
The free public library stands em
phatically for the use of all the people
in the community where it is located.
A wise recognition of this fact is seen
in ;he recent purchase by the Berkeley
Public Library of a collection of works
of Swedish literature for the special
use of a large number of Swedish fam
ilies residing in the southern end
of Berkeley. The books are all stan
dard works and include histories, bi
ographies, stories, travels and volumes
of fo'klore and poetry.
On the San Francisco Public Li
brary shelves are many works In the
German, French, Italian and Spanish
languages. Nearly three per cent of
the entire circulation of the library
last year was of German and French
fiction. A large portion of these,
however, was read for culture pur
poses by English-speaking persons.
The Chicago Public Library pro
vides liberally for the reading of the
different nationalities of that city. In
the German collection are 22,000 vol
umes; French, 10,000 volumes; Scan
dinavian, 5300 volumes; Bohemian.
4000 volumes, and smaller representa
tions each of Hungarian, Polish,
Spanish and Italian. It seems but sim
ple Justice that public libraries which
are supported by * general -taxation
should supply reading matter for the
use of the foreign-born citizens Â¦who
late in life are unable to acquire pro
ciency in English reading.
The City Council of Los Angeles
recently passed an ordinance provid
ing for a popular vote upon the pro
posal to issue city bonds to the amount
of $250,000 for the" construction of a
new library building and to secure a
site. Acting Mayor Eowen h*n vetoed
the ordinance, submitting the state
ment that it is inexpedient at the
present time to further increase the
city indebtedness. .
Wtittier, Los Angeles County, has
lately received a circular of inquiry
concerning that place from the office
of Mr. Carnegie. Such circulars are
sent fn answer to applications for li
brary building gifts, and if the replies
by the city authorities prove satisfac
tory to Mr. Carnegie they are, as a rule,
followed by a notification of a donation
upon the usual conditions. These condi
tions, -which are rarely deviated from,
call for a pledge by the city authori
ties that a suitable site for the build-
Ing will be provided and that an an
nual maintenance will be made of 10
per cent of the amount of the gift
Mr. Carnegie's plan of giving money
to dtle* for library purposes is based
upon the idea of co-or>eratlon. If he
also furnished money for the purchase
of the site the charge might be made
that he exercised paternalism and,
consequently, that public spirit would
not be aroused. The required pledgÂ»
of a stated minimum maintenance is
manifestly reasonable.
Book* of travel are in great and con
stant demand at the Los Angeles public
library. An addition of 500 new books,
a Iar_-:e portion being imported works,
has jtist been made to the library.

You cannot afford to grow old.
In these days of strenuous competition
it is necessary to maintain as long as
possible one's youthful appearance.
It is~ Impossible to do this without re-
taining a luxurious growth of hair.
The presence of dandruff indicates the
presence' of a burrowing germ which
rives and thrives on tho' roots of the hair
until it causes total baldness.
Newbro.'s Herplcide is the only known
destroyer'of this pest, and it is as effect-
ive as it Is delightful to use.
Herpicide makes an elegant hair dress-
ing as well as dandruff cure. . t

Local Architects Interested in the
Proposed Plans for the Beauti
fying of the City.
On Monday, February 1. the San
Francisco Chapter, American Institute
of Architects, celebrated its twenty
second anniversary by an Informal
dinner, attended by a large number of
the profession.
Among the several matters of im
portance discussed was that of the
adornment of the city, and the at
tention of the chapter was called to
the recent meeting of citizens to dis
cuss the same subject. The chapter
thereupon requested that the matter
should be taken up by their com
mittee on municipal art. which has
addressed the following communica
tion to the citizens* committee:
The Improvement of San Francisco, to which
you have apclled ycAirself. Is a matter In which
of necessity all citizens of this city should bÂ«
deeply Interested. . There 1Â», however, a large
number to whom a movement of thla kind ap
peals with a special force: they are the people
whose vocations, whether artistic or practical,
have led them to see the possibilities of thrt
city along the lines of municipal adornment.
By reason of their familiarity with the es
thetic possibilities of San Francisco, gained
through their profession, the architects of thla
city- are Ju3tly entitled to occupy a prominent
place in the development of this matter. .
Therefore the San Francisco Chapter, A.Â« I.
A., having the interests of this city at heart,
would be pleased to co-operate with your hon
orable committee in attaining the desired ends,
feeling that. ' by united action, we can achieve
better results than by the sporadic acts of nu
merous independent bodies â acting along simi
lar lines. , . . v
We can no more fittingly close than by quot
insr Dr. David Starr Jordan, who brings the en
tire-matter home In the following beautiful
language: , "The Callfornian loves his State.
because his State loves. hUn. and he returns her
love with a fierce affection that men of other
regions are alow to understand."

IX CHAMPIOXSHIP RACES
The first race. for the Dickey cup will
probably not take place before th^
Fourth of July in order to give the
yachtsmen a chance to lean;, the lake.
. At the meeting the championship
pennant for 1903 was awarded to Wil
liam Roeckner's scow schooner An
nie. The Annie had the largest win
nings for the year and is therefore en
titled to the flag of supremacy.
Eleven new models are being built
and with those already built this year
the fleet will greatly outnumber that
of last year. The new boats are all
fast and the one that wins the 1904
pennant wilPcertainly be a crack boat.
Next week the official measurer will
commence measuring the boats of the
club and hereafter all official races will
be held under time allowance tables
and rules.
At a meeting held during the week
the principal topic of discussion was
the over-all length of the boats. Last
year the largest models measured sev
enty inches over all, while this year
three have already been built measur
ing eighty Inches. The question raised
is whether the latter are eligible to
race. The matter of determining an
official over-all limit length was put In
the hands of a committee composed of
L. S. Adams, J. D. Daisley and E. P.
Leslie.
The San Francisco Model Yacht Club
will formally open the racing season
on the new Spreckels Lake in Golden
Gate Park in a few weeks. In the
meantime the small craft will have
practice races every Sunday. In this
way the owners will become accus
tomed to the new lake and will be bet
ter able to handle the boats.

on his Crossways Farm field yesterday
afternoon. While riding at a fast gal
lop his pony, fell, and in struggling to
regain his feet rolled over and over sev
eral times, and it seemed impossible
that the rider could escape without a
serious hurt. He did, however, and
only sustained a few bruises, which he
treated lightly.
The match was won. by the reds, di
rected by Walter S. Hobart, who played
a brilliant game throughout. The score
was 3 to 2 in their favor. The victory
was all the more notable from the fact
that the opposing whites were cap

LOS ANGELES, March 3.â Perfect
weather, a crowd of 4000, it being ladies'
day, and a dozen books to handle the
money of the betting public epitomizes
the conditions at Ascot Park to-day. It
does not tell what the public did to the
layers of odds. Five favorites and a ft
to 5 second choice were first to the wire,
and there were Ions lines behind the
books after each race. It was one of
the most successful days of the meet
ing for those who play according to
form.
There were a "number of nose finishes,
the most sensational of which was in
the fourth race, for the Oxnard handi
cap, for three-year-olds and upward, at
one mile. Waswift was a firm favorite,
opening at 7 to 10 and going to the post
at 1 to 2. Large sums were wagered on
his chances, notwithstanding he carried
124 pounds. Columbia Girl forced him
to stretch his neck all the way down
the last quarter, and 1:39*4 was hung
up when Waswift poked his nose in
front of the wire. Warte Xicht, upon
whose chances much money was laid,
was a poor third.
Revolt started the ball rolling for the
favorites in the first race, winning from
Magic Flute by a nose, with Maude
Brown third. The race was made iip of
fourteen ordinary platers.
Iras, ridden by Redfern, stood a
bruising finish in the second and got
up in time to beat Durbar a neck in the
mile and an eighth selling race.' Turtle
was third. The winner was 9 to 10 in
the betting. A goodly amount of money
went in on Dupont, but he failed to
show any speed at any stage of the
race.

NOTES OF THE TRACK.
The latter mare Reached the head of
the stretch first, but tired under Willie
Daly, finishing third. David S proved
to be much the best, for he was ridden
in the deep going part of the way and
then downed Young Morello half a
length. Blackthorn, a heavily backed
one, flattered his admirers by display
ing speed early in the race and then
faded away.
Some were unkind to refer to the
mile and fifty-yard selling fixture won
by Pat Morrissey as a boat race. Mr.
Dingle opened favorite for the race at
3 to 2. but for some reason the odds
lengthened to 9 to 5 despite a steady
public play. He was ridden by Dr.
Rowell's apprentice Travers. and his
effort was certainly a ridiculous one.
Travers received instructions" to take
the center of the track, thereby avoid
ing the heavy going on the rail. In
stead he went out of his way to grab
the rail position for some inexplicable
reason and was not placed at the finish.
There was a heavy play on Pat Mor
rissey just 'before post time. Holbro-ok
rode him with vim and energy, was
allowed to shape out his own pace and
practically won from' start to finish.
Among the late arrivals was Jack Mar
tin, astride Expedient, who brought his
mount up. in time .to' dispose of old
Prince Blazes a nose for the place..
PICIvAWAY SCOUES. . â¢
As Pickaway had been off in his
feed the stable didn't think the sprint
er good enough to win the five furlong
scramble, and from 4 his odds went
to 6 to 7. Amasa, wearing a new set
of plates, was played down to 11 to 5
favoritism and collected nothing. At
the start Sherwood Jumped away in
the lead with Pickaway and was never
headed. Nonie ran second, a head
before Quiz. Second into the stretch,
Amasa registered back among the
"also rans." .',.'
Most of the real smart money went
into the books on Handpress to. win
the final six furlong spin, and the little
fellow- came home. "He Â¦went to' the
post favorite and gradually ' wearing,
down Fair Lady Anna, led Modder out
two lengths. Mountebank couldn't
scare up a respectable gallop.
David S, which has played a hand, in
a little of everything connected with
the racing game, captured the second
six and a half furlong run, backed
from ?> l /2 to 1 to 13 to 5, equal favorite
with Montana Peeress.
DAVID S ! IS BEST.

desired to take no part in the proceed
ings, obligingly bolting at the start and
obtaining a return check.
It could not be called an espcepially
brilliant session for the favorites, as
but two succeeded in reaching the
home goal first. The track was slow
and cuppy. The books profited well by
the bowling over of Judge Voorhles,
Dungannon, . Montana Peeress, Mr.
Dingle and Amasa.
On paper Judge Voorhies lpoked far
and away the best of the ten start
ers in the first event, for which rea
son - he was- installed favorite. Well
ridden by See, the Judge once showed
first in the stretch, but could not stana
the pressure, and ran unplaced. The
cuppy going seemed to suit Adirondack
to a nicety, and at 5 to 1 the Shannon
entry, ridden by Jack Martin, beat
Past Master out half a length. Bux
ton finished third on Assessment. Nel
lie Bawn died away after leading into
the stretch.
Among the many offerings harpooned
from the pickle jar and thrust '-upon, an
unsuspecting public at Oakland* yester
day Dungannon exceeded. them' ail for"
flavor and tartness. ': ; /,- ". . ,-
The fact that the previous time out
the filly was beaten twenty, lengths or
some sudh trivial matter by the winner
of the race did not in the Â¦ least disconr
cert the ally's admirers. 'She : was one
of half a dozen starters In the second
event on the card, and it' certainly
looked a mellow spot to drop down a
ripe one.
The coin arrived on the ground
bright and early, and from 2 to 1 the
odds were swiped to 11 to 10. Unfortu
nately good things will crawl, and Dun
gannon finished second. Jerry Roach
took her out in front and she behaved
most becomingly until well straightened
for the wire. Then "Big Bill" Knapp
on Jimmy Coffey's Laocoon happened
to drop along, and after an extended
drive beat the favorite out more than
a length.

Hon. M. F. Tarpey of the Democratic

duly authorized leader of the Hearst
organization on the Pacific Coast.
WHERE IS BARNEY MURPHY?
Democrats are expressing surprise
that a meeting of the State Central
Committee of the party has not been
called. Again, there are many inquiries
as to the whereabouts of Barney Mur
phy. Two weeks ago The Call ascer
tained that he was at Portland, Or.,,
and published the intelligence for the
benefit of readers interested in Demo
cratic politics. Since then Mr. Murphy
has taken to the woods. There are va
rious rumors concerning his plans and
preferences. One rumor is to the effect
that he is touring the coast in the in
terest of Hearst for President, and an
other story is to the effect that he is
rounding up delegates in support of
Phelan for Vice President. His attitude
is as much of a mystery as Bard's letter
to Bulla.
tation has been reached. The Fresno
Kepublican asserts that Senator Bard
is entirely willing to be a candidate, but
his dellnltion of what constitutes a
candidate differs somewhat from that
often given in practical politics. The
Republican further says Â¦ of Senator
Bard:
He would appreciate the honor of a re
election, but only on terms which make it an
honor. His fri#ndÂ» should not be ashamed
or afraid to work for him on those terms. If
Senator Bard will not initiate an active per
sonal candidacy It is because he docs not
consider the office hla personal possession nor
a candidacy his personal privilege. The selec
tion of a Senator la the right of the people
and the Legislature of California. I>-t those
who realize that the sentiment of the people
Is for Senator Hard, and who are In position
to give form and expression to that senti
ment, do themselves the honor of taking ad
vantage of this opportunity.
Somebody must take the Initiative in bring
ing any man's name before the people. The
Republican hereby takes that initiative and
invites ttiose^who are In favor of the election
of Thomas" It. Bard to ?uer<srd himself, as
United States Senator to declare themselves.
Those who favor any other candidate have the
equal and unquestioned right so to 'declare
themselves. But It is time the lines were
beginning to be drawn.
Letters of a similar character were
written by Senator Bard to N. Black
stock of Ventura, Elwood Cooper of
Santa Barbara and Dr. Chester Rowell

Robert N. Bulla. of Los Angeles -aa
early as November 23, 1903, wrote to
United States Senator Thomas R. Bard
with a view of getting definite informa
tion as to whether the latter was a can
didate for re-election to . the Senate.
Evidently Mr. Bulla intimated to Sen
ator Bard that a great rush to get into
the camp of a passive candidate could
not be expected. The politicians re
mark that Mr. Bulla hoped to receive a
message from Washington to this ef
fect: "I am in the fight for re-election
with both feet. Line up the boys." The
reply which was transmitted differed
materially from the foregoing. Senator
Bard wrote: \ "I have said to Mr. Ox
nard in reply to his inquiry that I shall
not be offended in the least if he or any
other friends should announce their
candidacy for. the honor. I do not chal
lenge any one to a contest, nor will I
offer myself for re-election. I do not
anticipate what, the Legislature may
do. I will not myself do anything to
influence any of its members to support
me. I have no promises to make, or
other inducements, for any personal ef
forts that may be made In my behalf,
but, as I have said,. I will accept the
nomination by the Republican caucus if
made and will qualify if elected."
WHITES OTHER LETTERS.
On November 2 he telephoned to his
wife, and told her he was coming out
after supper to see the baby. He did
not have a policeman's club or iron
bar in hir- possession. Upon arriving
at the house he went to the back door
and knocked. His wife told him to
'go to the front door. He found the
front door open and Mrs. Dirking was
standing near the pcrlor door, calling
to his wife to bring the baby. Upon
seeing him she was much excited and
.said, "There is the murderer. ' Some
what bewildered, he turned and saw
Fritz Dirking advancing with a large
bread knife in his hand, who exclaimed,
"I'll fix you if you are a policeman."
Fritz made a lunge at Iiim with the
knife and Feld grabbed his wrist, at
the same time trying to pull him out-
Bide so as to be able to get away.
Mrs. Dirking th,en came up and tried
to hit him with the iron bar and young
Dirk!ns approached with a pistol. Mrs.
Dirking struck at him and hit her hus
band on the head. Stunned by the
blow. Dirking fell forward and grabb-^d
Feld around the waist, at the same
tinie taking Feld's pistol out of a hip
pocket. Feld then pulled the revolver
away with both hands and the weapon
was discharged accidentally. Feld then
stepped back ten steps and Dirking
followed with the knife, so the defend
ant told him to- stand back, as he had
something quicker than. a knife. Feld
Bays he then went back to the house
and his wife accused him of shooting
her father, which he denied, as he was
unaware that the bullet had struck
anything. Upon the solicitation of Mrs.
Herbert Choyonski, an attorney, was
the first witness for the defense. *"He
told of having advised Feld that he
could see his child, but that arrange
ments should be left to him. Upon
cross-examination Byingfon asked if he
advised his client to take an Iron bar
and pistol along when he went to see
his child or tcr kick in the door of the
Dirking house.
After Mrs. Fred McGlade of 903 Lar
kin street had been placed on the stand
to contradict the testimony of Attor
ney Hayes, Attorney Alford placed the
defendant on the stand. After several
preliminary questions he denied that
he had made any threats against the
Dirkinga to Mrs. Taylor, but admitted
showing her the cartridges "in a josh."
Attorney Hayes' testimo-ny was also de
nied by Feld. In substance his testi
mony relative to the shooting was as
follows:
Mrs. Sarah Taylor of 2420 Geary
street said that she had known Feld
for raore than tivo years, and that on
May' 1. l?03. he told her that he was
going oat that evening after duty to kill
the whole Dirking family. He also
showed her a purse filled with cart't Jges.
Mrs. Dora Quarles of 2538 Geary
street stated that she had known i!:e
defendant for four years, and that he
resided in her house with his wife for
"two weeks last August. That on Sep
tember 3, 1903, when Mrs. Feld, Mrs.
Shea and herself were present, Feld
said "that before he would pay his wife
a cent he would kill her and the whole
family." Mr?. Gertrude Shea of 265
O'Farrell street corroborated the testi
mony of the preceding witness.
William J. Hayes, attorney for Mrs.
Feld in her divorce suit, testified that
en the afternoon of November 2 he
called to see Feld at his mother's house,
i>03 Larkin street, to serve an order to
pay counsel fees and alimony pending
the hearing of the divorce trial. As the
witness was about to depart Feld called
him and said, "I am going out to see
that child to-night, and if I don't there
will be a rough house. If her mother
objects I'll hit her a clout in the eye,
too." â¢
District Attorney Byington here of
fered to show by Mrs. Quarles and
Mrs. Dirking that Feld had abused
his wife, but Judge Dunne sustained
the objection made by Attorney Alford.
The prosecution rested. Attorney Al
ford made his opening statement, and
an adjournment was taken until 2
o'clock.

of cartridges in the gutter 1n front of
the house. Sergeant Blank described
the cartridges as of thirty-two caliber
and such as used in the gun carried by
Feld.
Dr. L. D. Bacigalupi was the first wit
ness called by the prosecution and tes
tified to an autopsy performed by him
on the body of Dirking and the cause
of death. He was followed by Officer
Edward Stanton, who told of arresting
Feld ar.d subsequently taking him to
Â£t. Luke's Hospital.
â¢ Walter M. Kelly, a son-in-law of Mrs.
Dirking, gave an account of finding the
Before the noon adjournment Attor
ney Alford made the opening statement
for the defense and furnished the only
genuine Furrrise of the day â in his
declaration that the defense would en
deavor to prove that Dirking came to
his death as the result of the acci
dental discharge of Feld's pistol during
a scuffle over its possession.
Feld was plactd on the stand as the
last witness of the day and narrated
his version of the events of the night
of the tragedy. His testimony bore out
the statement made by his counsel
earlier In the day. Upon cross-exam
ination District Attorney Byingtcm
tangled Feld in many of the material
portions of his testimony, and accord
ing to the defendant the majority of
the witnesses for the prosecution com
mitted perjury.
From the raj>id progress made in the
trial of Joseph FeKi, charged with the
murder of his father-in-law, Fritz
1 tirking, it is anticipated that the de
fendant will know his fate before the
dawn at another day. The prosecution
closed its case shortly before noon yes
terday after jila-elng before the jury
rruch damaging testimony relative to
threats against the Dirking family
made l>j- F<?ld for months prior to the
homicide.

DENIES INTENT TO KILL
John W. Aiker. alleged to be an
opium fiend and looking the part, was
before Judge Mogan on a charge of
burglary committed aboard the river
steamer Constance on the night of Feb
ruary 22, while she was en route from
Bouldin Island to this city.
The defendant was employed as a
pantryman on the steamer, and the tes
timony went to show that on the night
in question he forced an entrance to
the room occupied by Steward John
Wainwright and was rummaging
around in the darkness, when that offi
cer awoke and demanded an "explana
tion.
"I came in to borrow a quarter," said
Aiker; "have you get one to spare?"
"Get out!" was Wainwright's reply,
and the pantryman withdrew.
Two hours later a young lady pas
senger who occupied a cabin was
awakened by a rough hand fumbling
about her pillow, and she shouted,
"What's that?" A rumbling voice
commanded h:r to be quiet, and with
true feminine perversity she screamed
as loudly as she could. The intruder
fled, but a glimpse of him was caught
by the steward, who responded to the
cry for help.
When the. boat arrived here Aiker es
caped ashore, but Detective Egan soon
caught him, and ever, since then the
case ha6 been hanging In Judge' Mo
gan's court. To secure conviction the
testimony of the young woman pas
senger was needed, but she positively
refused to testify unless she was as
sured that her name could not ap
pear in the newspapers. Even after
When the demon of discord sneaked
into the home of J. J. Richstein and
became so energetic as to make marital
life unendurable to Mrs. Richstein, that
lady betook herself and her portion of
the community property to 406 Geary
street, where she established a massage
and manicuring parlor and instituted
proceedings for divorce. Then, 'tis said,
the husband relented and proposed a
reunion, b.ut the wife spurned the pro
posal. This angered him and on Wed
nesday evening he visited the massage
parlor and flourished a pistol in such a
threatening manner that Mrs. Rich
stein shouted for help. Patrolman
Matheson responded and placed Mr.
Richstein under arrest, and before
Judge Mogan yesterday morning the
prisoner was charged with carrying a
concealed weapon and disturbing th*
peace. As the wife was not there to
testify the policeman was instructed
to have her in court to-morrow.
When the name of Beascic Fehse was
called in Judge Mog-an's court there
was no response, and Bailiff Hickey
was instructed to search the corridors
for him. Three times did the faithful
officer endeavor to correctly pronounce
the name in tones so loua that the win
dows shivered, and each time the
crowd of loungers in the hallway looked
at him in alarm. Then he returned and
informed the court that the man was
not within hailins distance.
"The charge against this Boaâ Boasâ
this defendant, is expectorating on a
public sidewalk," remarked the Judge.
"Where did he commit the offense?"
When it was explained that B. F.
had polluted the purity of a Barbary
Coast footpath by sprinkling it with
navy plug Juice his ball of $5 was
forfeited.
Nine women from the Hotel Nymphia
were released by Judge Fritz after they
had promised to aid the police in prov
ing the identity of the persons who own
the notorious place.
"I want to put this matter fairly up
to the police," said the court, "and
afford them every available facility for
convicting the men who obtain the
rentals paid by these women. It is use
less to herd in the women and allow
the men who profit by their immoral
traffic to evade justice. This remark
applies to Bacon place as well as to
the Nymphia."
Chapter 4, Court of Fritzâ Four de
fendants called for trial. Court learns
that their bail has been reduced and
promptly restores it to original amount
and orders defendants into custody.

Chapter 1. Court of Fritz â Thomas
Henry Conboy, Edward Gregg, Jacob
Schubener and Edward Downing are
accused of having swindled Stanislaus
Buchek out of $280 by means of a game
conducted at 406 Dupont street. Case
continued and bail of each defendant
fixed at $2000.
Chapter 2, Court of Conlanâ Attorney
Archie Campbell, representing afore
named defendants, appears and plcau3
for reduction of their bail, stating that
hi cannot find Judge Fritz in time t3

ceration. Bail reduced to $1000 each.
Chapter 3, Court of CabanissâAttor

rested for selling flowers on the side
walk at Market and Kearny streets,
were found guilty yesterday by a jury
in Judge Mogan's court. At request of
the defendants' attorney sentence was
deferred for. a week.
Â¦ Thomas Beattie, champion Caucasian
cakewalker of the Pacific slope, was be
fore the tribunal of Judge Mogan on a
charge of vagrancy entered by Police
man Nelson, who testified that Thomas
has been dividing all his waking hours
between the Jackson street dance halls.
In reply to a query from the bench the
defendant stated that he is a drum
player as well as a cakewalker, and vis
ited the dance halls to help out the or
chestra when the vocal sounds of rev
elry became so loud as to. drown the
instrumental music. Then . he volun
teered some other statements as to his
social standing, which were so contra
dictory of each other that the court
continued his case till to-day.

Certain storekeepers doing business
on Fourth street, between Mission and
Market, will learn with regret that
Mary Lonetti's smile is wasting its
brilliance In a prison cell. Mary was
arrested at 2 o'clock yesterday morning
for parading her smile at an unseemly
hour, and she is being held until his
Honor Judge Mogan can find out just
what section of the Criminal Code pre
scribes a penalty, and exactly what
that penalty is, for indiscriminate be
stowal of beaming glances, During the
hearing of the charge against Mary
she smiled at the complaining police
man, the Judge, the clerk, the bailiff,
the benchwarmers and the motley crew
in the prisoners' cage. And it was dis
closed that her daily practice has been
to convey her smile along the west
sidewalk of Fourth street and stop at
store windows and flash it through the
glass at the merchants within. Some
of these men of business did not yearn
for artificial illumination of their stores
by Mary and complained of her to the
police, while others welcomed her
facial radiance and smiled back at her.
But rt was not until her smile began
to work overtime and bedim in com
parison the arc lights and gas lamps
that Mary was arrested.
Mary's smile is apparently inextin
guishable.

Charles Altmint occupies the unique !
position of standing half convicted of
vagrancy. He and Walter J. Burke
were before Judge Mogan pn a charge
of ' being connected with a Dupont- j
street bunko shop in which a ruralist
was recently swindled out of $280, and
Policemen Ryan and Taylor had no
trouble whatever in convincing the
court that Burke was a chronic va
grant. When It came to proving their
case against Altmint, however, they*
had only half succeeded in doing so
when the Judge ordered a continuance
in order to allow them to procure ad
ditional testimony. So with 50 per cent
of him proved vagrant and the other
50 per cent of undetermined quality,
Altmint was reconsigned to the
"tanks."
Judge Fritz sentenced David Darling
to six months' imprisonment for steal
ing a watch that could be purchased
anywhere for $3. The fact that David
pilfered the timepiece from a man's
pocket enabled the court to "give h'ltn
such a heavy dose of incarceration.
"Charles Wilson" was the signature
attached to a complaint accusing Jo
seph May of assault with a deadly
weapon at 400 Pacific street, and while
the case was on hearing yesterday be
fore Judge Conlan the fact was adroit
ly brought out by the defendant's at
torney that the complainant's real
name is Charles Faraola, and that he
is a chronic vagrant. The court dis
missed the charge against May and
severely scored his accuser for signing
an alias to a sworn document.
"Was it the mercantile instinct that
impelled you to ask 75 cents for a ticket
that cost you 50 cents at the box of
fice?" inquired Judge Moga'n.
"Twenty-five cents' profit was little
enough to compensate me for my trou
ble In purchasing the ticket and my
disappointment at being unable to at
tend the theater that "evening," was
the reply.
"Well," said the court, "your plea
isn't such a bad one, and^I'll continue
this case for thirty days j to give you
time to quench your desire to pervert
that mercantile instinct of yours."
Leo Weingarten declared he was a
business man and that the mercantile
instinct impelled him to peddle thea
ter tickets without a license in front
of an O'Farrell-street playhouse.
I that assurance was given she balked,
'^and it was with extreme difficulty that
j the prosecution persuaded her to ap
pear in tfourt yesterday. Once there,
however, she told her storjj without

glances at the press reporters.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Sierra sailed last night for Hono
lulu and the Antipodes -with more
than 150 passengers and a full cargo.
Among those bound for the Hawaiian
Isles are seventy tourists from the
Eastern States. This is the largest
party of pleasure seeking travelers
that has left this port in many months
and the Oceanic Steamship Company
has detailed Traveling Passenger
Agent A. H. Moffitt to accompany the
tourists and give them every assist
ance toward making the most of their
South Sea visit.
E. V. Morgan, the recently appoint
ed United States Consul to Dalny, will
go on the Sierra to Honolulu and
there remain until he receives order3
to proceed to his post.
Alexander Young of Honolulu goe9
home on the liner and among the pas
sengers to Sydney is J. C. Williamson,
one of Australia's theatrical .kings.
The Sierra did not get away until
a late hour owing to the tardy arrival
of the British-Australian mail, which
reached New York behind time and
lost a number of hours on the" over
land journey. No time was lost, how
ever, after the mail arrived. It was
hustled aboard the waiting liner and
within a few minutes after the last
bag was passed through the side port
the Sierra was cutting her way
through the harbor waters toward the
Golden Gate.
Her passengers included the follow

KEAIi ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
"Few who have not visitc J Honolulu
can realize its beauties. Imagine a
wide stretching bathing beach of. white
coral sand, with water of such crystal
clearness that the bottom Is plainly vis
ible, shewing here and there patches
of sea moss adhering to the coral and
producing a variety of tones that seem
to beggar the rainbow. Then there is
the beautiful Kaplolanl Park, centered
by a racecourse, skirted by rapid tran
sit cars that pass every few minutes
for a 5-cent fare and having much of.
Its area covered by water on which
acres of pond lilies and water orchids
float in a picture of enchanting variety.
"Within easy reach of Honolulu Is the
Island of Oahu. which makes a highly
attractive excursion. Starting by the
early morning train one winds between
the Pearl Harbor Lochs and the fine
mountain rang?, dashing through fields
of sugar cane in every stage of culti
vation. Leaving the sugar fields be
hind, the traveler Is given a spectacle
of great marine grandeur. Across the
track, are high mountain slopes with
fertile valleys between and In the fore
ground the white foaming surf playing
restlessly on the coral reef3 and sandy
beaches in ever-varying gambols. On
the west end of the island is Walalua,
with its beautiful river and fine moun
tain scenes, where plenty of Interest
ing sport Is to be found for those who
enjoy gunning, and the ear Is charmed
with the song of the skylark, which
abounds In the glades between..
"But there are so many centers of
great interest throughout the islands
that I cannot even touch on them, and
I turn back instinctively to Honolulu
Itself with its wonderful Pali. This
precipitous bluff rises a clear thousand
feet, giving a panorama of the country
and ocean below that is of surpassing
grandeur. In the town itself there are
endless interests^ â the Royal Mauso
leum, the last resting place of Hawaii's
sovereigns, the home of ex-Queen Lill
uokalanl, the far-famed Bishop Mu
seum, with its magnificent collection
of Polynesian antiquities, showing the
rarest trophies of this 'Paradise of the
Pacific* But Honolulu must be seen to
be appreciated; to me it is home as
well as a wonderland where great
scenic beauty and health may be found
easily and cheaply."
! Alexander Young, who sailed for
I Honolulu on thek.Sierra yesterday, gives
I some interesting reminiscences of hi3
| early experiences in the islands in the
j days when white men were rare and
I the development of the country, from
the viewpoint of the Caucasian, had
not begun.
Alexander Young is the grand old
man of the Hawaiian Islands, and what
| he says about his tropical home is
worth listening to. He said last night
shortly before the Sierra sailed:
"It was In 1S65 that I first went to
Honolulu. Kamehameha V was still
reigning, and things were very different
[ then to what they now are. The sugar
Industry was then in Its Infancy, and
at the outset I associated myself with
the Iron trade, and it was only six years
ago that I relinquished the manage
ment of the Honolulu Iron Works after
a service of thirty-four years.
"During the days of my early resi
dence in Honolulu the native was a
very tame figure, the men- wandering
quietly Â«bout the place with only the
very scantiest of attire, but the women
always wore a kind of Mother Hub
bard. It is the chief feature of their
dress even now. In those days they all
had horses, men and women alike, ami
in brightly colored gala raiment, draped
with Ions scarfs having both ends fly
ing in the breeze, they made a most
imposing cavalcade as they galloped
down the grass-grown streets, where
now the finest street cars in the worM
rush the surprised traveler along ad
mirably kept thoroughfares skirting
scenes of almost indescribable beauty.
"The mechanics at that time were
only about a dozen; now there are
thousands, who make a generous in
come in an environment which for
plcturesqueness and salubrious climate
has no rival in the world. Sugar, tha
oldest industry of the island, still con
tinues the foremost one. but of late
years great strides have been made in
the growth fo pineapples and bananas
for export trade, the cultivation of the
exotic banana marking a distinct fea
ture in. this direction. Coffe.e growing
has been tried, but not with success. I
dabbled in the sugar busines myself,
but iron was always my leading card.
"When I retired six years ago I
thought I might be "turned out to
grass.* as the saying is. but the In
activity was too much for me and I
soon wearied of it.
"Then came my latest enterprise,
which is. indeed, my greatest, the Alex
ander Young Hotel at Honolulu, which
I regard with, I hope, a pardonable
pride. It was designed by an Ameri
can, built of American materials and
by American contractors and work
men. It is In the very heart of the
city, yet , commands quiet and seclu
sion, and with its unique roof garden
and unrivaled appointments can hold
its own with any modern caravansary.
The roof garden alone occupies a paved
area of a third of an acre, and there
concerts and dances are often given,
at which one meets Interesting travel
ers from all quarters of the globe, New
Zealand's wonderland and Alaska's
snowy plains.
"If you will put your ear to the
ground you will hear . the tramp of
thousands of men and teams complet
ing the connecting link between his
Eastern system and Pittsburg, and if
you continue to listen you will hear
the rumble move westward. Why,
George Kramer, who is vice president
of the Colorado Midland, and I will
not feel that our mission on this earth
has been completed until we see the
great engines of the Gould system roll
on to the shores of the Golden West,
and we will see it."
To this rather significant statement
George Kramer, who was an attentive
listener, solemnly added. "Yes, that
is our mission." With the Pennsyl
vania lines operating under their con
trol and connections made to this
coast. Gould and Rockefeller will be
masters of the greatest system of rail
roads In the world.
As is well known in all the Eastern
stock markets, Gould Rockefeller
have lately been buying heavily of
Pennsylvania Railroad stock in. the
furtherance of their plan to oust the
Cassatt factidn from the control of
that road* The two multi-millionaires
expect to effect this project a year
hence, when Cassatt's term as presi
dent of the Pennsylvania road ex
pire?. They will then try to replace
Cassatt with a man more favorable
to their interests, and then Gould will
have access for his own roads to the
Atlantic seaboard. Then he may be
expected to turn his attention to the
West. Upon this subject L. S. Thome,
vice president of- the Texas and Pa
cific, said, in response to a query yes
terday:
George J. Gould and his party, who
arrived here Wednesday evening, de
voted the greater part of yesterday to
seeing San Francisco. They left their
train at Third and Townsend streets
early yesterday forenoon, and under
the guidance of W. J. Shotwell. general
agent of the Gould system, rode over
the city on the various street car lines
for the purpose of viewing the resi
dence and manufacturing districts.
Having satisfied his curiosity In this
direction Gould asked to be shown the
local offices of his companies under the
Palace Hotel, where he greeted his em
ployes In a friendly way and then pro
ceeded to the city front, where he and
his party boarded the tug Relief and
enjoyed an extended trip around the
bay. The millionaire evinced a deep In
terest in the various points passed In
the Journey around the harbor and
asked many questions regarding them,
and especially In reference to ferry fa
cilities and the Government fortifica
tions. Returning to the city later the
party went to a local French restau
rant for dinner. Meanwhile the special
train which had brought the party to
the West was transferred across the bay
to the Oakland mole, where they joined
it about 10 o'clock preparatory to their
departure over the Central Pacific for
the East this morning. En route Presi
dent Gould will inspect the Rio Grande
lines and then go direct to New York.
Although the railroad magnate in his
Interviews shortly after his arrival here
Wednesday evening insisted that he has
no idea of extending his own railroads
to the coast so long as the Southern
Pacific and Santa Fe connections con
tinue satisfactory, his presence here,
nevertheless, is regarded as very sig
nificant by many prominent railroad
people. It Is believed, and in fact It ia
admitted by the friends of Mr. Gould
who are accompanying him on the
present trip, that his highest ambition
is to have his own rails connecting the
Atlantic with the Pacific, and many
are Inclined to suspect that his trip to
the coast at this time Is to satisfy his !
curiosity as to certain details of his j
contemplated invasion of Western ter- I
ritory. i

the decline wsÂ» attributed partly to the ab

; Dealers are at their wits" ena to know what
to do with' their load of Egssi. It is too early
to store them with Â¦ safety, the demand is not
sufficient to absorb one-quarter of the stocks
and the caily receipts continue very heavy.
The market continues to decline every day, but
the lower it gets the duller it gets. Cards
were sent cut yeiterday by commission houses
offering the pick of their floors ln lots to suit
at 17c, and sales of store at 14'/ac were re

Receipts of domestic Poultry were moderate,
but the market developed a weaker tone, as re
tailers were well supplied, having purchased
freely of Western stock en the preceding day.
Hens and old Roosters particularly were, dull
owing to the abundance of Western, but young
Roosters and Broilers were steady, with sup
plies limited. A enr of Western is scheduled

J NEW YORK, March 3.â To-day's etock mar-
I ket was as sUgpent as a pond without inlet or
I outlet It was only in stocks of a minor grade
j and which are usually obscure ln the market
â¢ ,, at movements were distinguishable at
J all. There were a few advances of a point cr
more In this class. Thoee advances/gave the
I impression of firmnesfe u, the market, which
V.OUIJ have been otherwise without any tone
1 There were a few weeks in the summer of 1900
wh?n the averape dealings were near to the
present level of dullness, but the dullness then
,was regarded as seasonable and probably tem
porary, and carried with It none of the pro
found discouragement which now pervades
\\all street regarding any chance for better
business in securities. Commission houses do
business at a loss and the nominal price cf
btock Exchange seats shows a sagging ten
atney. thouga no sales are reported It Is
I pe^^ry to co back to the bad old times prior
to 1MÂ». to find any exact parallel lo the present
â¢feeling in street. That was a time cf a
Melees stock market and idle millions of sur
plus reserve* in the banks and call loans at
I nominal figures day after day. The fixtures
or Uie date on or before March 23 for paying
over the Government deposits to be used in the
Panama canal payments opens the way for
clearing up one of the uncertainties hansinc
Â«v*r the marHet. The $10,000,000 paid to the
Panama republic simply goes from one set of
bank vaults and from the suhtreasury into an
other tank vault, so that local bank reserves
are the gainers to the extent of the payment
frcm the sublrea^ury. It has been allowed to
be understood al-o that the Panama republic
contemplates withdrawing- only 20 per cent of
itfc payments from New York, leaving *S,000 .
000 for investment here. The transfer of the
I remaining $4Â«.oOO.OfX> is expected alro to in
! crease the noney supply in New York, both
\ by transfer? from interior Government depos
itories and by payment from the gubtreasury
But the <.-;fÂ«Â»(.i of the actual distribution to the
canal companies' shareholders is a more obtuse
j problem in Its effect*. The accumulation of
j exchange alrecdy made by the bankers having
the operation .n charge and the proportion of
Panama cana] shares already held in this
country are the fr.ctors looked to to modify the
tffect of the payment.

seen. Pinks are higher and closely held at the
advance, with light supplies. The other de
scriptions are firm as a rule, with a continued
demand for overland shipment. It may be
well Â¦ to point out azain that there are two
sets of quotations 'for Beans â one representing
the price. which the Beans bring on the wharf
when they land from the ranches, and the
other what the same Beans bring for. Eastern
shipment after - beins rccleaned, which, of
course.,' add to the price. The quotations be
low are Intended to cover the range. -Thus a

Lincoln Hutchinson, instructor in
economic geography at the University
of California, lies at his home, 1910
Howard street, this city, with his Jaw
broken in two places and his face'cov
ered with bruises, all the result of an
encounter with a motorman on a Fill
more street car last Saturday night.
All the parties to the affair.are-main
taining a strict, silence as to its'de
tails. It seems, that Profes
sor Hutchinson was riding on the. front
end of the car with Professor William
D. Armes, about 12 o'clock Saturday
night, both being on their way to
Berkeley, after having spent an. even
ing with friends. # Upon reaching one
of the steep downtown grades the
speed of the car became 1 so- alarming
that Professor Hutchinson protested, to
the motorman.' This produced Â¦ no ef
fect, the man continuing to' run the
car in a reckless manner. Finally. the
professor demanded his number, which
the employe refused to ( give.' Hutchin
son then got up and took the' number.
The motorman at once struck him -in
the left jaw. Hutchinson's hands were
in his pocket at the time and he was

"The same suitors once repulsed are
now received kindly by the Mayor. How
have they, made themselves so pleas
ing? Your committee cannot agree
with the Mayor that rock-crushing in
a residence district is a legitimate busi
ness. We. are convinced that these or
dinances would increase the price of
material to no contractor except Gray
Eros. :. that rock can be brought .'n
targes from quarries on the 3outhÂ»rn
bay shore cheaper than the price
charged by Gray Bros. Your committee
does not believe that these ordina'nees
would drive the rock-crushing business
out of San Francisco."
The Street Committee again recom
mended the passage of the proposed
ordinance providing for the establish
ment of free public flower markets at
various designated localities. The corn
mil tee had already reported in favor
of the law, but it was re-referre3 to lt
in order that the Retail Flower Deal
ers' Association, which is opposed to
the ordinance, could be heard on the
subject.
T. M. O'Connor, representing the as
sociation, objected to the ordinance,
claiming that it is in violation of sec
tion 370 of the Penal Code and under
the charter the Board of Supervisors
has no power to grant a special priv
ilege, to any person to use the side
walks. O'Connor wanted the ordinance
referred to the City Attorney for his
opinion as to its legality, but the com
mittee took no action on the request.
L. M. King of the Merchants' Jtsso
clatibn claimed that the Board of Su
pervisors has the power to grant per
mission to. the flower venders to use
the sidewalks temporarily, as they will
not be permanent obstructions. King,
In answer to O'Connor's question, said
the board had the power j to designate
places where it would be legal to sell
fish, fruit, meats, etc., on public streets.
The bond of the California Ballast
Company to blast on Lombard street
was fixed at $10,000. .*
The committee recommended an ex
tension of. ninety days' time to the
Union Oil Company to maintain a spur
track on Illinois street.. The City Attor
ney is to advise if the company, is oc- .
cupying the public 'street, as reported
by City Engineer Grunsliy.
Grades were ordered changed on
Fifth avenue, Washington and Cherry
streets. â
-The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday recommended that ths three
ordinances extending the limits within
which blasting and rock-crushing oper
ations'are prohibited and requiring a
permit to be obtained for such opera
tions outside' of the prohibited limits
be passed by the Board of Supervisors,
notwithstanding their disapproval by
Mayor Schmitz. The committee Qled a
lengthy report, assigning Its reasons
for overriding the Mayor's vetoes. The
report states that the ordinances were
passed because a quarry in a residence
disixict is, a permanent evil. It refers
to the fact that the Mayor signed the
ordinance which closed Gray Bros '
quarry at Twenty-sixth and Dlimpnd
streets, but refused to sign the ivll
which would close the quarry they
sought to establish on Thirtieth street.
Thci report continues:
The board authorized Principal
Murphy of the Commercial School to
send letters to the various business
houses, together with specimens .of
the vertical, medial and Spencerian
writing systems, with the request that
they express their preference in the
matter, it being the intention of the
board to modify the present vertical
system in vogue in the schools.
~ The board decided to co-operate
with the art section of the California
Club in decorating certain rooms in
the public schools. Initial work in
that connection will be done on the
assembly room of the Franklin Gram
mar School.
The petition of a number of parents
that two rooms be added to the Park
Primary School was taken under ad
visement.
Captain Peter T. Riley of the Even
ing Emergency Substitute List was
elected a teacher in the Evening
School Department, and assigned to
the foreign class of the Richmond
Evening School, vice Miss Jennie
Doyle, transferred.
The grammar grade certificates of
Misses I. Hemmenway and L. Houss
ler were renewed and Mrs. L. Eisner
was recommended for a grammar
school life diploma.
Leaves of absence were granted to
J. S. Frank, H. W. Gray. J. Hurley,
C. C. Tompkins and J. Anderson on
account of illness.
The plans, specifications and estimate
of cost for the removal and reconstruc
tion of three corners of the brick base
ment of the Whittier Primary School
were ratified and approved.
The Board of Public Works was re
quested to instruct the city arci-tect
to prepare plans, specifications ana esti
mate of the cost of construction of
bracing and trussing of the roof of the
Mission High School.
The Board of Public Works was re

The Board of Public "Works was re
quested to have West Mission street

interferes with the best interests of the

The premises at 3-Joost avenue were
rented for school purposes in connec
tion with the Fairmount Grammar
School.
Mrs. J. McBean was elected a Janl
tress to take charge of the premises
at 3 Joost avenue.

fl Mrs. Elizabeth H. Thompson, bf Lilly-H
dale, N. Y., Grand Worthy Wise Templar,
and Member of W. CT. U., tells how she
recovered from a' serious illness by the use of
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
"Dear Mbs. Pixkham:â I am one of the many of your prateful friends
who have been cured through the use of iydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, and who can to-day thank you for the fine health I enjoy. When
I was thirty-five years old, I suffered severe backache and frequent bearing-
down pains; in fact, I had womb trouble. I was very anxious to get well,
and reading of the cures your Compound had made* I decided to try it. I took
only six bottles, but it built me up and cured me entirely of all my troubles,
v 't y famil 7 and relatives were naturally as gratified as I was. My niece
had heart trouble and nervous prostration, and was considered Incurable.
She took your Vegetable Compound and it cured 5"her in a short time, and she
became well and strong, and her home to her great joy and her husband's
delight was blessed with a baby. I know of a number of others who have
been cured of different kinds of female troubled and am satisfied that your
Compound is thebest medicinefor sick women." â Mrs. Euzabeth H. Thompson.
Box 105, Lillydale, N. Y.

Mother Says.
" When my little girl was six months
old, *he had eczema. We had used
cold creams and all kinds of remedies,
but nothing did her any s<>od, in fact,
nhe kept getting worse. I used to
wrap he r bands tip, and when I would
dres<s her. I had to pyt her on the table
for I could not hold her. She would
kick and scream, and when she could,
she would tear her face and arm*
almost to pieces. I used four boxes of
Cnticcra Ointment, two cakes of Cutl-
enra Soap, and gave her the Cutlcnrx
Besoltreot, aodshe waÂ« cored, and I see
no traces of the humour left. I can
trathfally e*y that they have saved her
life, and any one suffering: as she did, I
