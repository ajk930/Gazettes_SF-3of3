BIG DEAL
IN STREET
RAILWAYS
Hellman Sells Stock
in Pacific Elec
tric Line. â¢
H. E. Huntington Buys tlie
Shares for Himself and
E. H. Harriman.
San Francisco Capitalist Disposes of
His Interest itf the Interurban
System of Los Angeles. '
Banker L W. Hellman has sold his
interests in the Pacific Electric Rail
read Company of Los Angeles to Henry
E. Huntington. The transfer was ef
fected at a meeting held at the Palace
Hotel yesterday afternoon and goes on
record- as one of the biggest deals of
a railway character transacted in this
city for many months.
There were present at the meeting
I. W. Hellman. Henry E Hur.tington
and William F. Herrin, chief counsel
of the Southern Pacific Company. He
acted as the personal representative of
E. II. Harriman.
Although the documents signed at
the meeting did not bear the name of
Harriman, it was announced on good
authority after the meeting that Hunt
ington had purchased Hellman's in
terests in the electric system on ac
count of himself and Harriman. The
news of the withdrawal of Banker
Hellman came as a surprise to those
who have be?n closely watching the
affairs of the street railway magnates
of Los Angeles. It was only recently
reported from the south that Hellman
had become dissatisfied with the policy
of the street roads in which he was
interested and had joined with Harri
man in defeating Huntington's ambi
tion to elect a new board of directors
friendly to himself.
At yesterday's meeting, however, it
appeared that the three railway men
were on the best of terms-and-thai-lf
a renewal of hostilities between Harri
man and ttuntlngton had been contem
plated they have now been abandoned.
While Banker Hellman declined to be
interviewed last evening on the results
of the meeting one of his close friends
volunteered this statement:
"Negotiations between H. E. Hunt
ington and I. W. Hellman for the
transfer of the latter's interests in the
Pacific Electric Railroad Company of
Los Angeles to the former have be^n
going on for several weeks and finally
resulted in Huntington coming to thi3
city to meet Hellman. At yesterday's
conference Hellman set a price for his
block of stock and Huntingtcn accept
ed the figure. You may state that,
notwithstanding reports to the con
trary. H. E. Huntington and E. H.
Harriman are on the best of terms in
so far as their business relations are
concerned, and that yesterday's pur
chase was made jointly for Hunting
ton and Harriman, who will hereafter
direct the policy of the big Los An
geles street railway and its interurban
extensions. Hellman, however, retains
his interest In the L*>s Angeles Rail
way Company, in which he and H. E.
Huntington are the principal stock
holders,"
The Pacific Electric Railroad of Los
Angeles is the biggest system of its
kind in that city. It controls the inter
urban lines, which for a time threat
ened to make war between tha South
ern Pacific Company and the street
railway owners. It Is regarded as one
of the most valuable properties in this
State. Why Banker Hellman, who was
an Important factor in the financing of
the road, should have decided to retire
Is a matter he and his associates are
not inclined to explain. It was said
by one of his friends last evening that
Hellmcn had realized a good profit
from the sale of his interest and was
satisfied to withdraw.
H. E- Huntingdon, Immediately after
yesterday's meeting, announced his in
tention of departing to-day for New
York, where he will meet President
Harrimac of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and with the latter he will de
cide on many extensions of the Pacific
electric road, which have been in con
templation for a number of months.

NEW YORK, Dec. 8.â Mrs. Cassie L.
Chadv.'ick' Is to-night occupying one of
â¢the scantily furnished cells in the
Tombs. After a fruitless search all day
for bail her attorneys gave up the fight
to-night, and Philip Carpenter, her
chief counsel, stood in the corridor r of
the Federal building at 9 o'clock, when
United States Marshal Henkel . threw
open the double doors of his office and
led the woman out of her. prison. â¢:
Mrs. Chadwick was wan, tired and al
most fainting. She made- her way
across the hall to the elevator leaning
heavily on the Marshal's arm and on
that of her son, Emil. Behind camethe
nurse, Freda Swenson, . and Deputy
Marshal Kennedy. * â¢ ~"
The party crossed . through a double
row of curious people to a carriage,
which was in waiting on the Broadway
side. Thev were driven directly to the
Tombs. Arriving there Mrs. Chadwick
was half-carried up the steps and into
the building. Warden Flynn met the
party, and after the usual prelimina
ries "had been attended to the woman
asked for permission to have her nurse
remain with her. This was denied, the
Warden saying that she should have
no privileges not allowed other prison
ers. . â¢â¢ â ;
Mrs. Chadwick gave a handbag and
a few trinkets to the nurse and whis
pered some instructions to her son. She
was then taken to the matron's room.
She asked to say good-night to her son,
and the lad eagerly rushed to his moth
er and wrapping his arms about her
gave her a lone embrace. Then she
was led away to the inner office, where
her pedigree was taken and she was
assigned to a cell. The son and nurse
entered a carriage and were driven to
a hotel.

MINERS UNITE IN REQUEST TO

RESOLVED, by the California Miners' Association, That we beg you, as President of the United States,.to assist in the
solution of this problem affecting all the interests of a great commonwealth, by instructing the Director of the United
States Geological Survey, through the Secretary of ( the Interior, as part of his study of the storage of flood waters and

affected by the detritus from torrential streams. â From Memorial Adopted by Miners' Convention.

SEEKING NEW LAWS
The California miners' convention
yesterday memorialized President
Roosevelt to take steps that may ulti
mately permit the resumption of hy
draulic mining in California. First the
convention adopted the memorial as a
part of the report of the committee on
resolutions, and the vote was unanim
ous in its favor. Instruction was then
given to segregate the memorial and to
forward it to Washington without de
lay, sending with it a copy of the ad
dress delivered by Professor Christy of
the University of California, in which
the entire situation is exhaustively re
viewed.
The memorial sets forth that "we are
firmly convinced that by a rational ap
plication of the laws governing the
deposition of sediment from torrential
streams the industries of both hydrau
lic mining and agriculture may be car
ried on in this region, not only without
prejudice to each other, but to their
mutual advantage."
A suecific request is made to the
President '"to assist in the solution of
this problem, affecting all the interests
of a great commonwealth, by instruct
ing the director of the United States
Geological Survey, through the Secre
tary of the Interior, as a part of his
study of the storage of flood waters and
the reclamation of waste lands, to un
dertake a particular study of those por
tions of the Sacramento and San Joa
quin valleys affected by the detritus
from torrential streams. In view of the
importance of this inquiry to the three
fundamental industries of agriculture,
mining and commerce, we beg that this
inquiry be rndertaken at the earliest
opportunity and pushed to completion
as rapidly as consistent with thorough
ness."
The preamble to the resolutions, that
were made a part of the memorial to
President Roosevelt, contained many
interesting statements. Including men

Resolved, liy the California Miners' Asso
ciation that we btg you, as President of the
United States, to assist in. the solution of this
problem affecting all the interests of a great
commonwealth, by instructing the Director of
the United States Geological Survey, through
the Secretary of the Interior, as uart of his
study of the storage of flood waters and the
reclamation cf waste lands, to undertake a
particular study of those portions of thÂ« Sac
ramento and San Joaquln valleys affected b>
the detritus from torrential streams.
The points we wish particularly considered
are:
Klrst â ThÂ« most favorable sites for reser
voirs fcr water, whereby destructive floods
may be averted and the waters stored and
utilized for the benefit of agriculture, mining
ana other industries.
Second â The selection of suitable tracts of
waste lands and of the most suitable means
whereby the detritus from torrential streams
r>ay be. deposited on such waste lands, bo aa
to reclaim them ajid convert them gradually
into lands suitable for fores-try and other agri
cultural purposes, and at the same time to re
move from euch streams their burden of de
tritus so that they may cease to be a menace
to the navigable waters of the State.
Jn viÂ«w of the Importance of this inquiry
to the three great fundamental industries cf
agriculture, mininjr and commerce, -we beg
that this inquiry be undertaken at the earliest
opportunity and pushed to completion as rap
iifly as consistent with â  thoroughness.
BENJAMIN PROMOTED.

cidedly good impression.

"NOT GUILTY"
Motion Made by the Defense
for Dismissal of Murder
Charge Is Denied by Court
AN EXCEPTION IS TAKEN
Attorney General Webb De
cides to Take a Hand in
Prosecution of the Case
AUBURN, Dec. 8.â Judge Prewett to
day denied the motion of counsel for
Adolph Weber to set aside the infor
mation charging him with the murder
of his mother. Judge Prewett said that
if there was any evidence at all in the
record that tended to show the guilt of
the accused, it was not within his Jur
isdiction to review the conclusions of
the Justice of the Peace who had com
mitted Weber for trial. Were the pro
ceedings on habeas corpus he could
pass on the question of the insufficiency
of evidence, but in the present case he
could not. As it was the transcript
contained sufficient evidence to justify
him in denying the motion for a dis
missal. â  . -,y ...
Attorney Tabor took an exception to
the action of the court and Weber be
ing called on to plead, entered a plea
of not guilty. Â§
The defense then asked that the mat
ter" of setting the case for trial be post
poned and by consent it went over till
next Monday afternoon.
WILL. AID PROSECUTION'.
Attorney General Webb to Take
Charge of Weber Cose.
In response to the request of the
Placer County Board of Supervisors
and of many prominent people through
out the State, Attorney General Webb
is making arrangements to lend assist
ance to the prosecution in the Weber
murder case. The prosecuting attor
ney has refused all offers of aid, but the
Attorney General has jurisdiction to
assume charge of the case in spite of
objections from that official. "w',
Attorney General Webb was undecid
ed yesterday whether to go to Auburn
himself or send an assistant. In view
of the great importance of the case, he
is being urged to take personal charge
of the prosecution.

support of the State Mining Bureau
was recommended to the Legislature.
The improvement of the navigability
of waters of California* and the recla
mation of waste lands "that may be
accomplished without injury to the
mining interests of the State" were
advocated. The making of a geolog
ical map for California was favored
and the Governor and Legislature
were asked to consider the desirability
and propriety of making the necessary
appropriation to carry out this work,
suggesting that the detail work be
performed by the geological depart
ment of the University of California.
The- work of organizations to im
prove forestry conditions and con
serve the water supply in California
was indorsed. Also the work of the
good roads convention at Glen Ellen
and the efforts of all similar organiza
tions for better roads.
A resolution of interest to the pe
troleum miners of California was
adopted asking that oil land locators
shall have the advantages accorded
to other miners.
John F. Davis reported for the
committee on legislation. Recom
mendations were made by the com
mittee which were embodied in the
resolutions regarding legislation that
have been summarized in the fore
going.

These were cared for last night by
able speakers at the direction of H.

ter. Judge John F. Davis responded
to the toast, "The Miners of Califor

BOSTON. Dec. 8.â Thomas W. Law

others, has knocked over $114,000,000 off
the value of the stock market securi

developed the greatest bear raid in the
history of Wall street. The greater
portion of this shrinkage in vaJue has
come to Amalgamated Copper, vhich
lost nearly $2:2,000,000 in market value
â within two davs.
.Leaving out the other Boston copper

ern Pacific panic of May 9, 1901.
Warned by the signs of the coming
storm made visible yesterday in the
preponderance of orders to sell over
those to buy, the traders were early
on the floor of the exchange. When the
gong sounded for the opening of busi
ness there came from the struggling
groups of brokers on the crowded floor
a roar of human voices so loud that it
thrilled those who heard it. At first it
seemed that all were sellers and none
was left to buy.
As the shrieking men surged around
th*Â» trading posts, the "impending im
portant developments" in this stock,
"the possible increase of dividend" on
another, "the coming agreement with
its principal rival" of a third or what
ever were the bull arguments on which
advances were based were all forgotten
and brokers sought only to get rid of
the stocks they held. The scene was
observed by a throng of visitors in the

First to give way in the hurly-burly
was Amalgamated Copper, against
which a campaign by newspaper adver
tisement has recently been conducted.
Dropping sometimes a point at a time,
it fell until it sold at 5S^. a decline of
10 points since last night's close, and
of 22 points from the highest of Tues
day. The 22-point recession represented
a decrease in the market value of the
company's total capital stock of more
than $30,000,000.
Next \o Amalgamated Copper, the
leader in the excitement was United
Slates Steel Corporation stock, the
c<nnmon falling to and the pre
ferred to S4. overnight declines of 8Vi
points and 7% points, respectively, and
declines of SM points for the common
and 1076 points for the preferred from
Tuesday's highest.
The shrinkage in quoted values
from Tuesday represented about $45,-
Omi.000 on the common and $36,000,000 on
the preferred, an aggregate on the
company's capital stock of more than
J80.O00.O00.
MARGIN'S ARE WIPED OUT.
Other sensational declines were 5U
in Union Pacif c. 4 1-S in Southern Pa
cific, 6 3-S in American Sugar, 2Vj in
American Tobacco preferred, 7*4 in
BrooKlyn Transit, 1% in St.' Paul,
11*4 in Colorado Fuel, 11 in Michigan
Central, o 1 , in Missouri Pacific and 9V t
in Tennessee Coal and* Iron. Values
throughout the entire list were cut
down with great rapidity, weekly mar
gined accounts were wiped out and for
nearly two hours the demoralization
was complete. During this period the
transactions amounted to about 900.000
shares.
The frightened throwing over of
stocks almost without regard to prices
was checked about noon, and there fol
lowed a period of irregularity. Heavy
buying orders appeared, quotations
started upward, and before 1 o'clock
many of the active stocks had regained
considerable of their losses. The tone
of the trading remained feverish, but
the rally was well held and the close
was. comparatively speaking, severely
quiet. The total sales of all stocks to
day were 2,905,400 shares.
Many causes for the day's selling
were suggested, but the general opin
ion seemed to be that the bull market
had brought in many buyers on small
margins, and when the signs of an im
pending break were seen yesterday the
holders were forced to sell out their
speculative "purchases at whatever
prices wer*Â» obtainable.
BROKERS OX WARPATH.
NEW YORK. Dec. 8.â It is likely
that interesting developments will fol
low the collapse of prolonged specula
tion in the shares of the Montreal and
Boston Consolidated Mining Company's
stocks, a curb issue, which fell to-day
from $3 56% a share to 50 cents. It is
estimated that fully $750,000 has been
lost somewhere in the manipulation of
this stock and it was freely hinted to-
night among numerous brokers who
fell victims to the speculative game
that a trap had been laid and that they
had been badly SQiieezed.
At the New York Athletic Club bro
kers who hold Montreal and Boston
stock held a meeting to decide on what
measures shall be taken to protect
themselves. It is understood that the
decision of this meeting has for its ob
ject the drastic punishment of those
whom they believe guilty of what they
term "a plant."
Monroe & Monroe of 20 Broadway,
who have been actively identified with
the promotion and sale of Marconi
Wireless stock, have been within the
last month or two very prominent in
the marketing of Montreal and Boston
stock.
By all artifices known to manipu
lative Wall street Montreal and Boston
stock has been brought to the atten
tion of the speculative world. It has
been freely advertised in newspapers
as a "sure thing." Purchasers of the
stock were practically guaranteed
against loss. To give persons an evi
dence of guarantee several New York
Stock Exchange houses lent their
names and assistance to efforts to
mark up the price of the stock. Curb
brokers were given unlimited orders to
buy and sell the issue. Scores of them
were congratulating themselves on the
enormous commissions they had reaped
from the execution of orders Intrusted
to them. In the collapse all these
profits were swept away to-day. The
speculative bubble was pricked to-day
when it became known that Monroe &
Monroe were unable to take stocks for
which they had given contracts." In
stantly the price of Montreal and Bos
ton collapsed.
X-RAYS CAUSE THE SKIN
OF XEGRO TO TURN WHITE
Discovery of Pennsylvania Savant Af
firms the Statements Made by
Other Scientists.
PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 8. â Dr.
Henry K. Pancoast, University of
Pennsylvania x-ray specialist and
sklographer, affirms the claim previ
ously made that continued use of
x-rays on negro patients produces a
gradual change in the shade of the
skin and that in time it becomes
white. â  |
Dr. Pancoast treated a negro for
lupus, which had affected the pa
tient's nose and part of his face. It
was found after the treatment had
been continued daily for more than a
month the skin on the affected part
had become entirely -yhite.

POPE UNVEILS
VIRGIN'S STATUE
Anniversary of Proclamation
of Dogma of Immaculate
Conception Is Celebrated
BEILLIANT CEREMONIES
Jubilee Ends With Banquet
to the Many Notables Who
Gather in Rome for Affair
ROME, Dec. 8.â A pontifical mass
was celebrated to-day In St. Peter's
in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of
the proclamation of the Dogma of the
Immaculate Conception. A procession
which went down to St. Peter's by the
grand staircase from the Vatican was
imposing in the extreme, owing to
the variety of the uniforms of the
guards, the richness of the papal
court costumes, the purple of the
Bishops' robes and the Cardinals' vest
ments, forming a brilliant setting for
the venerable. \vhite-garbe<3 figure of
Pius X. The procession passed on to
the papal altar, where was deposited
the triple crown.
After the celebration of mass at the
hich altar the procession slowly re
formed and wended, its way to the
chapel choir, where the Pontiff with
great emotion presided over the un
veiling of the statue of the Virgin of
the Immaculate Conception, bearing
its magnieent new diamond crown, the
gift of the faithful in all parts of the
world. This is the statue which was
crowned by Pope Pius IX at the time
of the promulgation of the Dogma of
the Immaculate Conception.
After the ceremony the procession
returned to the Vatican, the Pope, who
was fatigued, going immediately to his
private apartments.
In the beautiful hall of the Borgia
apartment in the Vatican Papal Secre
tary Merry del Val gave a sumptuous
dinner of thirty-six covers this evening
in honor of the guests who have ar
rived in Rome for the jubilee. America
was represented by Bishop McDonnell
of Brooklyn.
Rome was literally ablaze to-night
with illuminations in honor of the.jubi
lee of the immaculate conception. St.
Peter's was the chief center of the illu
minations, but the display at the
American College was very effective,
Venetian lanterns, electric lights and
torches being utilized, with striking re
sults.
PRESS CLUB HOLDS FULL
SWAY AT THE TTVOLI
Annual Entertainment Attracts Im
mense Audience That Revels in
Clever Performance.
"The Press Club owned the Tivoll
last night." President W r . C. Holli
way said so in the speech he made be
fore the curtain at the end of the first
act. He said the club owned every
thing about the Tivoli, even the lovely
chorus girls. He wanted everybody to
have a good time. He wanted the au
dience to "Jolly up" and thoroughly
enjoy themselves.
The great audience took up the
spirit of the occasion and at once en
tered into the full enjoyment of the
splendid performance of "King Dodo."
Local hits written by members of the
club were frequently interspersed.
These were short, snappy and bright
and well interpolated by the actors.
Every song in the opera was encored.
Al! the principals were favored by the
club with great baÂ»Â£ets of violets.
When they came on at the finale of the
opera each wore a bunch' of these fra
grant blossoms.
Following the entertainment at the
Tivoll a reception was held at the
home of the club.

the fighting of November 30 the second
son of General Nogl was | killed on 203
Meter hill. General Nogl's eldest son
wask\lled in the battle of Nanshan
hill and he is now childless.
MUKDEN. Dec. 8.â The Russians
continue to bombard the Japanese posi
tions with both heavy and light artil
lery. The Japanese response is feeble.
Numerous Japanese prisoners are be
ing brought in, as a result of constant
night sorties. The Siberians especially
delight in this sortie work and seem
to regard the stalking and capturing of
pickets and sentries as exhilarating
sport. Some . of the prisoners declare
that the prevailing inactivity is having
a greatly depressing influence upon the
masses of Japanese troops. Others of
the captives refuse to answer ques
tions. The Japanese evidently are not
short of food', but the cold is extremely
trying upon them.
Lieutenant General Linevitch had a
narrow escape from death recently. He
had approached within a thousand
yards of a Japanese battery, when a
shell dropped near his staff and killed
an enlisted man.
PARIS, Dec. 8.â The Temps this
evening published the following dis
patch from Mukden, dated to-day: \
"I have just returned from a ride
along the Russian front. The soldiers
are living underground, in preference
to the filthy Chinese houses. Complete
quiet prevails, and the general expec
tation is that the present quarters will
be maintained for the winter. I learn
from excellent sources that the reports
that a great battle is imminent are un
warranted."
TOKIO, Dec. 8.â Manchurian head
quarters, telegraphing under date of
December 7, says:
"At 2 o'clock on the morning of De
cember 6 the enemy posted at Wuch
enying advanced toward Paotzuyen,
which is near Sienchuang. Our watch
ers were temporarily withdrawn, but
with reinforcements they immediately
recovered the position. Between 2 and
4 o'clock on the morning of December
7 the enemy attacked. east of Fanshen
and at Heilintun, which is pear Shakhe
village. By sunrise the attacks were
entirely repulsed."
AMERICA LOSES A POINT.
Costly Failure to Appeal the Steam
ship Arabia Case.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 8.â
Through the failure of the Americans
interested in the cargo of the German
steamship Arabia, confiscated by the
Vladivostok prize court, to lodge an
appeal, their cases not only went by
default before the Admiralty appeal
court, but the United States Govern
ment lost an opportunity to obtain a
decision on the question of railway ma
terial which might have formed a basis
for a renewal by the. United States
of diplomatic representations regarding
such articles- as* "conditional contra
band.
The cargo originally confiscated con
sisted of about 2,500,000 pounds of flour
and railway material and machinery
bound for Japanese ports. The Ameri
can embassy at St. Petersburg prompt
ly notified the Washington authorities
of the manner in which the appeal
should be lodged, but the papers for
the appeal arrived only after the de
cision of the Admiralty court had been
rendered last Saturday. The British
owners of 5500 sacks of flour, less than
half the amount in dispute, had regu
larly entered an appeal, and in accord
ance with a decision of the Foreign
Office, reached some time ago and
communicated to the United States,
there being no evidence that this flour
was destined for the use of the en
emy's forces, the decision of the Vlad
ivostok court was reversed.

Russian Press Urges That Black Sea
Fleet Be Sent Out.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 8.â The
newspapers here, headed by the Novoe
Vremya, are still urgently pressing the
campaign in favor of the immediate re
inforcement of Admiral Rojestvensky's
squadron. The proposition to send out
the Black Sea fleet meets with popular
favor, irrespective of the diplomatic
difficulties in the way, and in this
fashion sentiment is being adroitly
directed against the Foreign Office and
Admiralty, which is evidently the real
object .of the promoters of the agita
tion.
Captain Clado, who was detached
from Admiral Rojestvensky's squadron
in order, to testify before the interna
tional commission to inquire into the
North Sea incident, again returns to
the attack in a letter declaring that
the argument that the withdrawal of
the Black Sea fleet . would _ weaken
Russia's position in the Near East is
not convincing, Turkey's navy being
powerless to threaten Russia even
though the whole Russian fleet departs;
while Great Britain, might bluster, he
,adds, the opinion is that she really
would act short-sightedly if she op
jKJsed the exit of. the fleet, as Russia,
if she lose her Far Eastern posses
sions, must seek an outlet nearer home,
either in the Mediterranean or in the
Persian Gulf. How, he inquires, would
Great Britain like a Russian arsenal
and a Russian fleet within a few hun
dred miles of Bombay?

DENVER. Dec. 8. â United States
Ccmmissioner A. B. Capron to-day
bound over to the Grand Jury Max
and William Schradsky, two of the
persons charged with conspiracy to
prevent people from voting at"there
cent elections. , Sam. Plessner, Max
Sissick and Samuel Slatkin were dis
charged, although Commissioner Ca
pron, in rendering his decision, said:
The conduct of the latter was reprehensible
and they could be punished for misconduct at
an election, but the evidence does not Justify
holding: them on the charge of conspiracy. It
does not appear that they said or did anything
to prevent the people from voting.
All of the defendants were election
officials. The two Schradskys acted
as constables, and the testimony of
fered by the attorneys for the Repub
licans showed that they ran the poll
ing-places to suit themselves.

REPLIES TO HAY
WASHINGTON. Dec 8.â The Charge
d' Affaires of the Japanese legation to
day Informed the Secretary of State
that the invitation of the President to
the second peace conference had been
communicated to the imperial Govern
ment by the United States Minister in
Japan. The Charge was Instructed to
say that the Japanese Government cor
dially sympathized with the beneficent
purpose that inspired the Invitation
and that experience had shown that
there was urgent need for more exact
definition and uniform practice of in
ternational law than now existed in
regard to some of the questions which
it was Intended were to be submitted
to the conference.
The Japanese Government, he said,
did not find in the fact that it was en
gaged in war any sufficient reason why
It should not, under the present cir
cumstances, take part in the proposed
conference, provided that the confer
ence to be assembled did not take or
assume to take action relative to or af
fecting in any way the present conflict.
Subject to these reservations, the im
perial Government, he said, gladly ac
cepted the invitation and would be at
all times prepared to exchange views
with the Government of the United
States as to matters to be considered
by the new conference.

NEW YORK. December 8. â Vincent
Assor. aged 12, only son of Colonei
end 13 r^-. John Jacob Astor. has un
dergone an oi>*?r;Ui',>:i for appendicitis.
It was apnarentr^*successful and the
chances for recovery are said to be
excellent.
ARE YOU SICK?
Foul tongue?
Lops of appetite?
Lack of energry?
Pain in stomach?
General weakness?
These are but a few of tbj s.^ns of
Indigestion.
Some others are: Wind in the stom-
ach or bowels; constipation or diar-
ihea: pa!e complexion: spots before' the
dizziness*; loss of flesh; irritabil-
ity; sleeplessness; nervousness.
All these pyniptoms will plague and
torment you. and will never perma-
nently leave you, once you suffer from
them; only are sure, in time, to get
trorse, if not treated by the best known
scientific method of cure â Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
These curative tablets are composed
of ingredients which modern knowledge
of the true inward "processes of"dlges :
tion approve of, as forming the best,
safest, surest and most scientific com-
bination cf medicinal drug's that can
be used to relieve all the Conditions of
Ul-health brought on by this much-
dreaded disorder.
A disease so "protean" or changeable
la its manifestations, assuming so
many forms, characterized by so many
different symptoms that, more times
than not. it is mistaken for some other
disease altogether, and the fOQC.patient
may die. or at best allow the seeds of
permanent, chronic sickness to. germ-
inate and take root in his system.
So it i? a real danger we ask you to
avoid, when we say: In case of doubt,
t.ike Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Even if disordered digestion is not
the real cause of your sickness (which,
piobably. though, it is), yet your di-
pestion iÂ« nearly certain to be out of

CO-OPERATIVE
YARD PROBABLE
Labor Leaders Approve Plan
of the Townseiid - Down
ey Shipbuilding: Company
PROFITS FOR 'LABORERS
S;wlsl D;Â«ra!ch to^The Call
NEW YORK, Dec S.â Proposals made
by the TownEer.d-Dowm-y Shipbuilding
Company to open a co-operative yard
have been approved by union labor
leaders according to Wallace Downey,
president of the company, and the new
enterprise will shortly lA? launched on
an "open shop" basis.
Downey declared to-night that the
differences between the company and
labor unions which resulted in the
closing of the yard have -all been set
tled and that' several delegates of the
Amalgamated Society of Engineers are
circulating application blanks for the
purpose of recruiting a force of work
men to begin operations.
The Tovvnsend-Downey Company
closed down its plant because of fre
quent disagreements between it and its
employes.
"Some of the delegates connected
with the Amalgamated Society." said
Downey, "are doing all they can to
mak? the co-operative plan a success.
The New York Metal Trades Union has'
always stood for open shop. Since' I
outlined the plan on November 28 lasjt.
I have received assurances of suooort.
We expect to begin work with two hun
dred men. I am confident that such
a shipyard will be a success and that
it may be established within the next
two months."
Under the general plan of organiza
tion the worklngmen will receive the
prevailing rate of wages and at the end
of each year a share In the surplus, the
dividends being based upon the amount
of their wages for the year. Allowances
will be made in computation for repairs
and deterioration of the plant, for the
interest on the amount of capital in
vested and for the losses. Downev
proposed that in his new scheme al
lowances be made for labor and capi
tal and that a surplus fund be formed
from which dividends ' to several
branches of the establishment might be
paid. His plan is different from other
co-operative ideas in that it provides
that labor, through the reserve fund
s^jStem, shall share not only in the
profits, but in the losses.
WANTS DRESSES
OR THEIR COST
Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK. Dec. 8.â Suit for $3760
was begun' to-day against Howard
Gould for a varied assortment of
frocks and frills his wife is alleged to
have ordered and had fitted, but re
fuged to pay for. The list of articles
numbers sixteen garments, all of which
are declared to be of wonderful con
struction, with trimmings and finish
ings that dressmakers say should bring
Joy to the heart of any woman. The
complainant is the firm of Braud & Le
Royer, which has establishments in
Newport and Paris, as well as in New
York.
The complaint 6tates that sixteen
dres- s Mere ordered by, Mrs. Gould
between October 4 and November 9 of
this year. Mrs. Gould, it is declared,
chose the material for her garments
with the utmost care, and directed the
fittinsr with equal exactness. The
dresses ranged in price up to $500, and
as they were finished, they were deliv
ered to the former actress at the Hotel
St. Regis, where she and her husband
were stopping.
Eleven of the orders had been fin
ished, and. it is alleged, delivered, to
her when Mrs. Gould canceled her order
for other garments. * â¢'..

A Sign
Of poor blood circulation is shortness of
breath after walking, going upstairs,
sweeping, singing, excitement, anger,
fright, etc. Poor blood circulation means
a sick heart, and a sick heart is a result
of weak and impoverished nerves.
Every one knows the results of poor
blood circulation, but everybody does not
know that the quickest and safest treat-
ment is Dr. Miles' New Heart Cure.
If you find these symptoms present
you should not neglect them, but at once
procure a bottle of
Dr. Miles'
New Heart* Cure
It will cure, and at a very'little expense
compared with doctors' bills. We are so
sure of It that, if first bottle does not
benefit your drugist will return your

"Whatever is said about these notes
must be said by my attorney. Mr. Car
penter. That is an entirely different
matter," she replied.
"But you have already been quot.e.1
as denying that Mr, Carnegie bad any
thing to do with "your business affairs
or that you had Tdriy'notes of his."
"As I said before you will . have to
talk to Mr. Carpenter about that," the
woman answered.
Mrs. Chadwick seems to be especially
grieved that any one should construe
her removal from the Holland House to
the New Amsterdam Hotel and from
the New Amsterdam to the Hotel Bre.s-
Hn as ;a flight from the secret service

FUTILE QUEST OF BAIL.
This has been a momentous day tor
Mrs. Chadwick. It commenced with
her early departure from her hotel for
the. Federal building and ended with
her incarceration in the Tombs. â¢
In the interval she had b?en ar
raigned Lofore United States Commis
sioner Shields and held in $15,000 ball.
All day long lawyers representing her
interests had sought in every quarter
for some one owning real estate in
Manhattan who would sign her bond,
and the Marshal, out of sympathy for
the woman, had kept her in his office
hours after she should have been re
moved. The endeavors of the lawyers
were unsuccessful, rendering her im
prisonment necessary.
To add to her cup of woe, it was
learned to-night that a charge of for
gery would very likely be made against
the woman in Ohio, based on the Car
negie note and other papers given as
security for loans.
Efforts to get bail will continue to
morrow, although Mrs. Chadwick ex
pressed the desire to-night; t6 go to
Cleveland as soon as possible. '
Mrs. Chadwick dined *at 7 o'clock in
Marshal Henkel's office under condi
tions In strange contrast to the manner
in which she lived at New York hotels.
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.
"When Warden Flynn was seeji after
Mrs. Chadwick had arrived at the
Tombs, he said.:
"Mrs. Chadwick wlil'be placed In a
cell on the second tier of the prison.
She will be 'entirely alone on the tier*,
which Is set apart from other women
prisoners. She is a United States pris
oner and will hot be allowed associates
In any v way. To-morrow, morning, she
will have her meals.' wjth the others,
but during the day she will be com
pelled to remain alone.' "If she is ill
she will be attended by the physician,
Dr. Levin, whose duty it is to look
after United States prisoners."
When the warden was asked as to
her pedigree, he replied:
"She gave her age as 51 .'years, said
she was born in the United States, not
specifying any State, and that she was'
married." . â¢
AÂ«?ked whether she would. be allowed
to retain ~her medicine chest, he said:
"No prisoner is allowed. to have med
icine except that which, is ordered by
physicians, and Mrs. Chadwick will be
no exception.- She will' be treated like
the other prisoners here.*'... -' .
SHOW DISLIKE
FOR SPY SYSTEM
PARIS, Dec. 8.â In the Chamber of
Deputies this afternoon the Govern
ment escaped defeat by the narrow ma
jority of two votes, 276 to 274,'\ou a
resolution Inviting the Government to
refer to the Superior Council of Judges
the' cases of those magistrates who
have been guilty of making secret in-'
vestigations.
The Cabinet's Harrow escape from
defeat is due to the unabated indigna
tion at the system of informers in the
various departments of the public serv
ice, the first exposure of which in con
nection with the army caused General
Andre's resignation of the Ministry of
War. The. discussion of the budget of
the Ministry og Justice furnished a
fresh opportunity for. appealing. to this
sentiment, a deputy demanding the
punishment of those magistrates who
had furnished secret information con
cerning their colleagues.
Premier Combes vigorously criticized
the tactics of the opponents of the
Ministry, declaring that it was unfair
to continually bring up t the question
after his expressions of disapproval
of the system and promises to suppress
the abuses. He further maintained that
persons lawfully supplying the Govern
ment with important information
should not be considered informers.
â The Premier's arguments did not con
vince the Chamber, the Ministers' own
votes alone averting disaster. ' . ,.;â¢

morrow over the Premier circular ( .to

SAN JOSE, Dec. 8. â Eight large
spots were discovered on the sun to
day by Father Ricard of Santa Clara
College. They occupy the first quad
rant of the solar hemisphere. Three
of them, evidently the result of seg
mentation, stand very near the limb.
Four others form a quadrilateral
quite near the vertical diameter or
axis of the sun, two on each aide. The
four spots of the quadrilateral are
very ' large," one â¢ of 'them" being espe
cially prominent for* the -blackness of
its nucleus, its vast, dimensions and
the swaying to and fro of Its penum

EseclsJ Dispatch to The Call
SAN JOSE, Dec. 8. â Co-operation in
â¢J] Its phases was discussed this morn
ing by the convention cf fruit growers.
Once or twice a reference to the trans
portation matter of yesterday was
made, but President Cooper sklilfully
ehut off the discussion.
The committee on resolutions,
through John Markley, chairman, re
ported this morning and the report,
after some discussion, was adopted.
The resolutions favor the abrogation
of the present contract between the
Pacific Mail and the Panama Railroad,
believing that it would reduce freight
xates, as tramp steamers could then
connate with the Pacific Mail, and
that the whole Pacific Coast would
benefit by it; the establishment of a
parcels post with a rate as cheap as
now givtn by the American express
companies to the British, and asking
that postal conventions be concluded
with all nations in the International

State of Wisconsin, to formulate new
revenue laws that -will provide a dif
ferent form of taxation for the State

to effect this a constitutional amend
ment is urged.
Edward Berwick of Pacific Grove ad
dressed the convention relative to the
formation of a parcels post league. .
A. R. Sprague. chairman of the com
mittee of fifteen on co-operation, fol
lowed with an address on the necessity
of co-operation. He attempted a di
gression which threatened to open up
the transportation subject, â¢ but was
called to order by R. D. Stephens, and
then confined himself entirely to the
subject of co-operation. Sprague de
clared that while in his opinion the
Rochdale system was the best which
could be adopted by the growers, it
was not- at present available. The
profit sharing plan appeared to him to
be more suited to the time.
CO-OPEHATIOX IS DISCUSSED.
Professor C. W. Chllds, who had
charge of the dried fruit demonstra
tion at the World's Fair at St. Louis,
declared that if the growers could get
their fruit shipped to the East without
charge they would still be unable to
dispose of the crop unless they could
offer their product to the consumer at
a lower retail price than prevails at
the present. He stated that 12% cents
a pound is the prevailing price among
the Eastern retailers.
Mr. Gordon of Sacramento said he
was much interested . in co-operation
because of. its failures. He had tried it
with the raisin growers and found that
only the intervention of the Almighty
could make all the raisin growers go
Into a co-operative plan, and only by
all going into a plan could it be made
a success.
D. T. Fowler of Fresno followed and
explained in detail the various modes of
co-operation.
The operation of the Southern Call-,
fornia Fruit Exchange was described
by C. A. Day of Los Angeles.
Just before adjournment the commit
tee, of fifteen reported two plans of co
operation and the report as a whole
was adapted. These are the same as
reported yesterday.
The first plan provides the growers
wherever practicable shall organize as
sociations to pepare the fuit for market
and that these organizations form a
central agency through which the sell
ing to the market shall be k done. The
sales are v to be made at such times and
price? as such agency, acting with the
associated organization. .. shall, . deem

CHRISTIANITY
AND THE NEGRO
. NEW, YORK, Dec. ; 8.â Before a mis
sionary .mass-meeting in Holy Trinity
Church, Brooklyn, called to discuss the
work of.*' the*. Episcopal church among
the negroes, Bishop . Burgess of the
j diocese of Long, Island, who presided,
I declared that : the fate of the church
| and state alike Is Involved in the solu
tion of this problem. If the white peo
ple do ;' not . elevate the negro, he de
clared, the negro- surely will drag his
I white superiors to his own level. Chris
tlanitj' alone could do it, he said. .
â¢ The Rev. Dr. c;F. J. Wrigley, arch
deacon of South* Brooklyn, said he
feared that 'a mistake had been, made
in the enfranchising of the negro when
he was hardly prepared for the solemn
duty. If this, mistake. had been made,
he said,' great must I be ' the reparation
from the North in money, and In work
to bring the negro to a state where he
might work out his own destiny. In
dustrial education-will be the means
for this, Dr.'.Wrlgley believed. -
- Dr. Wrigley asserted also that prac
tically a state 'of anarchy exists in the
South to-day. : A 'great movement of
negroes had; set Un to the cities, where
they -were iiving\ wretchedly .and shift
lessly, and '.yet; before the warthey had
done 'practically "all ; the. skilled' labor of
the South. The trouble, he believed,
had . come . ': â  from . a ; misconception of
what liberty" meant' when ' the negroes
. received; it.. Negroes In" this â¢ condition
were 1 a menace : to the "church, the state
and themselves. -To remedy, this they
must be educatedâ made . to see God.
| They. should be given- a chance for in
â¢ dustrial. development. : ,Then when the
negro had his \ chance if he took ad

Flaring posters on the university

Instead of dying down, the bitter feel
ing of a majority or the students
zKainst Captain Nance proves merely
to have been suppressed, for the news
that "Pelican" would deal in caustic ,
fathi'.'n with the captain's obnoxious
marching orders was greeted with
shouts <-f Joy. The senior class, sixty
members of which are on probation and
liable to suspension any moment for
jail are to obey Nance s orders, has j
taken to heart, sadly, the suspension of [
one of its best leved men. W. T. Hale,
editor of the Daly Californian. and
while it has perforce submitted to
Nance's iron hand, it has neglected to
kiss the rod.
It was freely predicted to-day by the
more conservative men that "Pelican's"
satire on the Nance episode would re
mit in trouble for the editorial board,
of which Eugene Hallett, one of
Nance's adjutants, is chief. Captain
Nance apparently has failed to realize
the propriety in a situation which per
mits one of his lieutenants to print a
humorous publication, in which the
military department does not play a
very dignified part, and it Is feared
x that the diligence he showed in met
ing out punishment tc; the men who
criticized him in the Daily Californian,
as did Hale, will be repeated.
Nance is pictured in one of the car
toons as a schoolmaster with a big
bell, directing the movements of three
students on drili. In other witticisms,
portraits and cartoons, the military in
structor finds himself the subject of un
merciful lampooning.
Editor Hale, who was suspended for
criticizing Nance's orders, is the sub
ject of some interesting cartoons. The
"co-eds" are put in one picture dressed
in military blouses, lined up for mili
tary inspection, with i Nance looking
them over.
The seniors who attend Nance's class
in military instruction brought two big
fraternity dogs into the classroom yes
terday, and these createa such a dis
turbance that the class was badly dis
organized, to the captain'6 intense dis
gust. He sent for the university police
to remove the animals, and when the
men guffawed he sternly suppressed
the signs of enjoyment. The disturb
ance is expected to be the beginning of
a series of seemingly innocent ordeals,
including the current "Pelican" edition,
which Captain Nance is to unndergo as
a sequel to his disciplinary measures.
TALKS ABOUT
WATER SUPPLY
Berkely Offico San Francisco Call,
Onter Street, Dec. 8.
Marsdcn Marion, former member of
the Board of Public Works of San
Francisco, delivered an. address to the
Berkeley Improvement clubs at a mass
meeting at Shattuck Hall to-night. The
subject was -Municipal Water Supply."
Victor J. Robertson presided. Engin
eer Manson told how George H. Men
dell, C. E. Grunsky and himself had,
trfajte members of the Board of Public
Works, secretly obtained vast water
ehfd rights on the Tuolumne River for
development as a source of water .*up
ply for San Francisco and outlying,
cities. He said that agents of tht
Kprin? Valley Water Works and other
interests had been securing water
righis all over Northern California for
years to cheek the posslbllity'of a.n*Â»w
â¢supply interfering with the monopoly
in San Francisco.
But Manson continued he had. with
hiÂ« associates, employed United States
Geological Survey men to help in locat
ing the rights on the Tuolumne, and
that there can be made available a
supply of 40,000 million gallons of wa
ter annually that the public can take â
Â«*xtra-seasonal wuter, he termed it, to
which the people have legal claim.
Engineer Manson explained that this
watershed would be free from all con
taminating influences, that the water
would be pure and undefiled. He ar
gued that to possess a pure water pup
ply was the best advertisement any
community could havÂ«Â«. Manson In-'
vited Berkeley as one of the bay cities I
to Join with San Francisco in working
to gain a supply from this Tuolumne
River source.

Founders of Plan See Noble Work Finished
OAKLAND, Dec. S.â It Is not gener
ally known that Mrs. Paul Lohse, a
prominent Oakland society woman,
founded that splendid organization, the
Catholic Ladies' Aid, that is about to
open a girls' home in San Francisco.
Over seventeen years ago Mrs. Lohse
recognized the urgent need of orga
nized philanthropy, and encouraged by
Father King set herself to the task of
systematizing the work of relief, that
had hitherto been, left to charitable In
dividuals. Her efforts were attended
with success, and in a short while
nearly all of Oakland's prominent
Catholic women were banded together
under the name of the Ladies' Aid So
ciety. Branch No. 1. A flattering proof
of Mrs. Lohse's foresight and executive
ability lies in the fact that the consti
tution and by-laws of the society are
still intact as she framed them.
Of recent years continued ill health
has prevented the founder from taking
a very active part in the work so well
begun, but she had gathered about her
many noble women, who have carried
out the society's plans most worthily,
notably Miss Mary Carr, whose* devo
tion to the cause of charity is too well
known to need more than passing com
ment. Miss Carr is now past president
of the order, and in conjunction with
Mrs. Margaret Deane. past grattd pres
ident, and Mrs. T. P. Hogan, president
of Branch No. 1, has done much to
bring about the founding of the Girls'
Home and the general thrifty condition
of the society.
The Catholic Ladies' Aid has spread
until now it includes twenty-four
branches. Some conception of the work
accomplished may be had when it is
stated that the Oakland branch alone
has expended in cash over $1400 in the
last two years. That does not include
the groceries and clothing that have
been distributed.
The Girls' Home, which will be dedi
caetd Saturday by Archbishop Rior
dan, is situated on Gough street, in San
Francisco, and is intended to be a hotel
where girls alone in the city may ob
tain board and room at living rates.
Two rooms have been furnished by
Branch No. 1 of Oakland, and other
apartments have been furnished by va
rious branches and by wealthy women
of San Francisco. Among the well
known women who are greatly inter
ested in the society and are among its
most generous patrons are Mrs. Henry
Mathews of Oakland, Mrs. Loughbor
ough. Mrs. M. H. de Young, Mrs. Ber
tha Welsh, the Misses O'Connor and
Mrs. Frank Sullivan of San Francisco.
The dedicatory services Saturday will
be participated in by Most Rev. Arch
bishop Riordan, Coadjutor Archbishop
Montgomery, Rev. H. H. Wyman. C. S.
P.. and Rev. D. O. Crowiey. A fine
musical programme has been arranged,
the participants being Mrs. M. Mc-
Glade, soprano; the Elks' Quartet;

BEGIN WEAVING
THE EVIDENCE
Prosecution and Police Open
the Preliminary Examina
tion of David Kiniry, Thug
Prisoner Smiles Pleasantly
as. the Testimony Piles Up
to Form Murder Case Chain
Oakland Office San Francisco CaJl.
1016 Broadway, Dec. 8.
David Kiniry was placed on prelim
inary examination to-day before Police
Judge George Samuels on a charge of
murdering Policeman James H. Smith
November 27, 1903.
This enigmatical criminal smilingly
watched the coils of circumstantial evi
dence woven In court to-day. He smiled
when Police Judge Mortimer Smith,
brother of the murdered patrolman,
faced him from the witness stand. He
smiled and joked when clinching bits of
evidence filtered from the witnesses as
strong points in the case were unfold
ed. He was keenly intent, however,
and his sharp eyes saw everything that
went on.
Identification of the slain policeman
was given by his brother and the story
of the shooting was developed. District
Attorney John J. Allen assisted Prose
cuting Attorney Leach. After Judge
Smith. Policeman John Cockerton told
about finding Policeman Smith wound
ed on the steps of the Palmer resi
dence. He also related, how he found
Goldstein's body and a pistol near it.
Detective Kyte explained a diagram of
the locality which he made.
Reeves Baker explained how he found
Patrolman Smith, from whose hand he
took a pistol. ;'/
Walter Withers testified he saw two
men with bicycles passing the Palmer
residence shortly before the shooting.
He saw and heard Policeman Smith
place the pair under arrest.
"Any questions. Kiniry?" asked
Leach.
"No, none," replied the prisoner. "He
explained everything very nicely."
Henry Herman, a coachman, gave
evidence as to watching two men run
through Fourteenth street after the
shooting. He was present when Gold
stein's body was found. Near it a gun
metal watch was picked up. That
watch, the police say, they will prove
belonged to Kiniry.
Testimony concerning Policeman
Smith's condition when he was taken
to the Receiving Hospital was given
by Dr. O. D. Hamlin. who gave a re
markably clear narrative. This, to
gether with Dr. Hamlin's report upon
the autopsy, forms strong points in
the case.
Dr. George G. Relnle corroborated
Dr. Hamlin. Dr. J. M. Kane and Dr.
C. E. Curdts gave evidence upon the
Goldstein autopsy, which was also
strong in support of the prosecution's
theory.
Dwight L. Strong,' Miss Daisy No
lan, Charles and Fred Kutz, brothers,
who heard the shots, added to the
record.
The two bicycles used by the bur
glars were taken into the courtroom,
while W. F. Townley, manager of.
Leavitt & Bill's cyclery, supplied tes
timony that connected Kiniry and
Goldstein with the wheels. Contracts
were shown Townley, 'which,' he said,
had been signed by Kiniry as follows:
"Frank ijmith, 1031 Franklin street."
and by Goldstein under his own name.
Kiniry stepped over to the wheels,
in the midst of Townley's statement,
and looked carefully and closely at
them. He nodded affirmatively to
Chief Hodjjkins.
Prosecuting Attorney Leach and the
detectives made" a search for num
bers on the wheels.
"If Goldstein made a good Job of It.
you won't find the numbers," said
Kiniry. . J; "
One number could be read, how
ever, and it is the wheel that Kiniry
bought under the name of Frank
Smith. Townley identified the wheels.
E. F. Thompson, 419 Hyde street,
San Francisco, testified that Kiniry
and Goldstein had occupied rooms at
1919 Oak street, San Francisco, when
Thompson lived there in October last
yt-ar. Thompson saw the men with
bicycles very like those in the court
room, j After the two men left Mrs.
Thompson found a cigar box filled
with plaster of parls In crucible form
and a black cloth face mask in Gold
stein's room.
Prosecuting Attorney Leach asked a
question touching gas Dills, the Import
being that Kiniry and Goldstein had
used gas and blowpipe to melt gold.
Thompson could not answer the query,
but as he left the witness-stand Kiniry
said to his former landlord:
"I'm sorry the gas bill was so high.
I hope you'll excuse me this time."
William Bannan, whose residence, at
1457 Harrison street was plundered of
valuable jewels a few days before
Smith was shot, identified a pair of
cuff buttons as having been among the
property .that was stolen. The but
tons were found In Klnlry's trunk.
The examination will be resumed
to-morrow morning.

OAKLAND, Dec. 8 Judge Hall has

SENDS BULLET
THROUGH BRAIN
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 8.â S. P. Allen,
a deputy United States Marshal from
Plute, Cal., and his brother-in-law.
Raymond Walters, were shot and se
riously wounded by Harry Burris, a
bartender, in a transfer office at Fourth
street and Broadway here late this aft
ernoon. Burris then ran to his room in
a lodging-house, a block and a half
distant, and blew out his own brains.
The enforced attentions of Burris upon
Mrs. Allen and an attempt by him to
extort money from her are said to have
caused the shooting.
Allen and his wife came here from
Kern Countv this morning and were
at the transfer office arranging to have
their trunks sent to their rooms when
Burris entered and uttering an oath
opened fire upon Allen with a revolver.
Burris fired two shots, one of. which
took effect in Allen's neck, inflicting a
serious wound. Allen then drew his re
volver and returned the fire, but missed
Burris. At this juncture Raymond
Walters, a brother of Mrs. Allen, en
tered the office,, and Burris turned on
him and flred one shot, which also took
effect in his neck. Burri* then fled
from the building, pursued by officers,
and committed suicide before they
could arrest him.
The wounded men were removed to a
hospital, where their wounds were
treated. Neither man was pronounced
dangerously injured. Burris was living
with his wife at the hotel where he
killed himself. He had known the Al
len family about two years.

TACOMA. Wash.. Dec. â¢ 8.â Wheat
conditions in Eastern Washington and

fall ha* been very light and from all
indications It' is thought that the com

that the wheat now in the cround will

tion that as to-day they will celebrate

behooved them to give attention to the
needs of their departed brethren.
Father Morris addressed himself to
the young women who would follc-w the
Virgin Mary's example and who would
take themselves from the world's temp
tations, against which they would be
fortified that they might resist them in
the evi'- hour.

ness and of what she had accomplished
for her people, but, she said, there
was one woman greater by far who tri
umphed over the enemy of the human
race by reason of her immaculate con
ception and this was the blessed Virgin
Mary. There was an impressive serv
ice in the evening.

Charles Colin, a Youth, Con
fesses to Stealing Let
ters Containing Checks
PAYEES' NAMES" FOKG El)
Visits Rooming Houses and
Offices for About Three
Months Without Detection
Charles Cohn, 20 years of age, was
arrested yesterday afternoon by Detec
tive S. Bunner and locked up in the
City Prison on a charge of forgery.
Complaints had been made to the po
lice that letters containing checks were
stolen from lodclnff-houses and offices
and theuchecks cashed with the sig
natures of the payees forged.
Detective Bunner arrested Cohn just
as he had stolen a letter from the of
fice of Dr. 'J. L. Coburn. 1141 Market
street. A check was found in his pocket
when searched by Bunner. About six
weeks ago Cohn stole a letter contain
ing a check for $150 from Archie Levy's
booking agency and cashed the check.
Two weeks ago he stole a letter con
taining a check for $25 from R. L.
Brown's room in a lodging-house at
Market and Eighth streets, and got the
money on this check also.
Cohn was not particular as to what
the letters contained. He admitted
when questioned at police headquarters
that he stole them just for what he
could find in them. He had been doing
that work for three months, and dur
ing that time he had stolen about 100
letters.
Cohn lived with his sister at 521 Ivy
avenue. He had been employed by the
Standard Shirt "Company, but says he
was discharged because he was ac
cused of having stolen some jewelry
from other employes. He made a full
confession of the letter stealing and
forgery, his only excuse being that he
found it an easy way to keep himself
in funds.

RETURNING TO

POPULAR AND SUCCESSFUL AC
TRESS WHO WILL OPEN* AT THE
CALIFORNIA NEXT SUNDAY.
The coming of the well-known Amer
ican comedienne, Rose Melville, to the
California Theaters on Sunday- night in
her original character creation of "Sis
Plopkins" brings tonptlce, the remark
able success achieved by this brilliant
young actress during her comparative
ly brief career on the stage. During
the six years she has been before the
American public in her unique char
acter of "Sis Hopkins,", Miss Melville
has accumulated a fortune estimated
between a quarter of a million and
three hundred thousand " dollars. It
would be impossible for local theater
goers to imagine the immense popular
ity this charming actress enjoys
throughout the East. She presented
"Sis" for five consecutive years in the
East before making her first Pacific
Coast, tour and during that time she
never knew what it was to play to an
empty seat On the occasion of her
first appearance in this city last fall
Miss Melville succeeded in packing the
California Theater at every perform
ance, including an extra matinee.
CANADA TO BUILD MINT
TO HANDLE YUKON GOLD
Dominion Will .Coin Bullion at Ot-

San Francisco.
OTTAWA, Ontario, Dec. 8. â The
Dominion Government will erect a
$200,000 mint here, which will be
equipped, manned and in operation
within a year. The establishment of
the mint means that the $15,000,000
or $20,000,000 worth of gold produced
in the Yukon each year will be coined
in Ottawa instead of going to San
Francisco.
The mint is a concession to national
sentiment, which believes that the
time has arrived when Canada should
coin; all her own currency. Copper,
silver and $2 50, $5 and $10 gold
pieces, will be made. It will be called
the Royal Canadian Mint.

PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, 8AN FRANCISCO
FRIDAY DECEMBER 9, 1904
IRRIGATION AND FORESTRY.
THE JYesident has treated the questions of irrigation and foresi
reserve in a manner that must carry a full measure of satisfac
tion throughout the West. His message recognizes that these
problems are not only vital to this section, but to the country at
large, and that their solution presses no less heavily upon the Federal
Government than upon the State. That the reclamation act, which
has been in force for only two and a half years, should already be
productive of extensive construction work is sufficient evidence of
executive vigor, and justifies an unbounded hopefulness for the
future. Â«â¢."'â  â 
Irrigation means population, it means prosperous and happy
homes, and it means the utilization by the people of the vast natural
wealth which lies beneath their feet, and which can only be made
available by water. Small wonder that California is in earnest upon
this matter, that she is tired of half measures or of no measures
at all. and that she welcomes the energy and the ability' which
promise to set jaX rest the vexed question of so many years. Prob
lems which involve interstate interests of such magnitude appeal to
the Federal authorities for solution, inasmuch as they alone have
the requisite power of equitable adjustment, and the necessary ma-j
chincry and credit to carry it into effect. Running waters are as
important to the West as is the land itself, and the greater the
extent to which they can be removed from the reach of private
ownership and financial speculation the better it will be for the
State and for the Coast. âj
So far as the forest reserves are concerned, they are insep
arably connected with the irrigation problem, and the President
speaks well when he says that the forest policy of the Government
is a subject of vivid public interest throughout the West. His words
exactly express the situation. Without forests there will be no
water, and inasmuch as by water California lives and moves and
has her being, her people naturally watch with keen anxiety every
factor which makes for or against, not only her prosperity, but her
very existence. Here again an equitable adjustment must rest with
the Federal authorities alone. The forests are sufficient, abundantly
sufficient, not only to fulfill their primary mission as water preservers,
but also to supply the legitimate needs of the lumber industries. With
the wise provision which the President advocates they can be made
efficient for both these functions. The forests can be used without
being destroyed, and their many sided beneficence can be made
permanent.
The creation of a forest service in the Department of Agriculture
must forcibly appeal to the ordinary commercial instincts of the
nation. It is an application of the same principle of responsible and
undivided control which is to be found in every business concern.
The United States is, it seems, the only great nation in which forest
organization is not concentrated under one control, and the Presi
dent is justified in saying that the present arrangement is bad from
every point of view, and that it should be terminated without delay.
His warm advocacy of a centralized forest service in the Agricul
tural Department, with its expert knowledge, its stored up and de
tailed information, and its staff of trained and capable men, ought
certainly to receive the support, and the outspoken support, of Cali
fornia, i ;
x THE SUGAR BEET IN COLUSA.
THE Colusa Sun in an appreciation of The Call's friendship to
sugar beet culture in that county as an important factor in the
needed and deserved development of the great Sacramento Val
ley explains the delay in the business. It seems there is difficulty
in getting the farmers to raise the beets. The Sun says that in the
agreement required by the men who put in the mill it is stipulated
that the contracting farmers shall cultivate the beets precisely as
an overseer, named by the factory owners, shall direct.
The Sun in comment says: "Now the American farmer is the
last man to give up independent action. Pretty much everybody else
becomes used to it. In beet districts our farmers are told the su
perintendent is usually a man direct from Germany, where author
ity is more pronounced than in this country, and the farmers do not
like to have such a one putting on importance over them and di
recting them what to do on their own premises."
The cultivation of the sugar beet is a specialty. It has to be
done in just the way shown by experience to produce the highest
percentage of saccharine, because the farmer is. paid by the sugar
content of his crop and not by the weight of vegetables he produces.
The beet gains or loses sugar according as it is handled. After it
has received its sugar content it may lose it by mistakes in handling.
Germany is the center of the sugar beet industry. It has been
followed there so long that everything affecting it is known by long
experience. While we do not know about the facts in the Colusa
case, it would be natural that a German from the beet fields of his
own country should be able to give the Colusa farmers the infor
mation they need to make the industry profitable to them. Ameri
cans soon know as much as any people can know about this busi
ness, but it cannot be carried on by hap and by hazard. In every
place in this State where the industry flourishes it has" been in
troduced and made successful by the same method that is found
offensive in Colusa County.
It must be remembered that it is a great change from the
raising of wheat, one of the primitive branches of agriculture, to the
raising of beets that must be treated as laboratories for the ex
traction of sugar from the soil'and air and holding it until it can be
extracted from them and milled for use. Beet raising is intensive
farming. It is scientific to the last degree. Its introduction any
where is a loud call to all farmers to be mindful that their vocation
has ceased to be carried on by rule of thumb, and has become a
scientific specialty of a high prder. If the farmers of other parts
of California and of Utah and Idaho have found the instruction
of a beet sugar superintendent compatible with their self-respect and
independence, the progress of the Sacramento Valley should not be
retarded by such a trivial cause.
The Sun assures us that Colusa wilt get around all these crooks
and turns, and we hope this is so. The revolting farmers propose
to make a beet growing corporation, much as the first fruit union
was organized, with stock and acreage going together. This cor
poration, being impersonal, is expected to submit cheerfully toShe
tutelage of the overseer.
This plan, it is supposed, will visit all the humiliation of being
dictated to upon the artificial person, the corporation which has no
personal pride nor self-respect, and the sugar beet industry will be
started next year. Whatever plan is adopted to save anybody's face
and feelings in the matter, we are persuaded that in a brief time
the initial difficulties will be forgotten and the example of successful
and profitable sugar growing in Colusa will be followed in other
parts of the Sacramento Valley. What can be done by enterprise and
effort is now on exhibition in Chico. Always a beautiful town, in a
fertile region, it has lately felt the inspiration of enterprise and is
going forward so rapidly that some of the old settlers find it diffi
cult to keep up. -1 '
With a chain of enterprises, founded by capital, requiring the
large employment of labor and forcing a diversification of crops,
which shall extend down the valley, doing for Colusa and. Marysville
what has been done for Chico, the great valley will come to its own,
and its people will wax in numbers and wealth. So let not the
Colusa farmers be too stiff-necked. .
Just before sailing for England James Bryce. publicly bore testimony
to the intelligence and sobriety of the' foreign voter in the United States. John
Morley, after spending a few hours in the Chicago election booths, was
dmilarly impressed. The mere intricacies of the ballot, he. said, would seri
ously tax the average English elector. These opinions are valuable at a time
when our foreign-born population is coming in for a good deal of criticism.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY; DECEMBER 9, 1904:
AT THE VOYAGE END
BY GRANT OWEN~
-^ ORBIX stood by the rail eager
/7j ly watching the thin blue lines
\T^ on the western "horizon and
thankful In his heart of- hearts
. that in a few hours he would be
on American soft.
The two months he had spent trot
ting about th'e Continent had been ut
terly waited. Instead of allaying the
old, dull pain they had intensified it;
for in every gallery and garden and
palace and particularly in the dingy
old cathedrals Polly's face, wistful,
regretful, but firm, had obtruded it
self upon his vision. He could not
help comparing those happy days
when he had followed her over all
Europe and their Jolly, frank com
panionship had been the bright spot
of his life, with his present condition
of lonely boredom.
As he stood disconsolate by the
rail he fully realized that the trip,
which he had hoped might result in
at~ least partial forgetfulness, had
been a dismal failure. He -was glad
it was at an end. \ '
He turned from the rail with the
intention of seeking the seclusion of
the smoking-room. As he made his
way along the deck, his mind still
occupied with disquieting thoughts,
he awkwardly bumped against the
footrest of an isolated steamer chair.
He lifted his cap and turned to of
fer abject apologies to .the occupant
of the chair, but instead of speaking
he stood quite still, staring in amaze
ment. When he did speak it was a
f-ingrle word into which was crowded
ji whole gamut of emotions:
"Polly!"
The girl sprang froin the chair.
"John!" she cried in a tojje that
matched his own.
Corbin leaned against the rail and
continued to stare at her as if he
could not credit his eyes.
"Great Scott!" he said, running his
hands through his hair and smiling
foolishly.
"Well, you're the last person I ex
pected to meet," said she.
Corbin groaned.
"And I've missed six whole days of
your society," he complained. "Tell
me, how does it happen I have not
seen you before?"
Th giri' laughed.
"Mamma is none too good a sailor,
you know, and this has been a rather
hard passage," she explained. "I've
been lookihg after her the greater part
of the time."
Corbin turned his eyes and looked
thoughtfully at the thin blue line of
the horizon.
â¢ "We'll be docked in five hours," he
said. "May I claim those five hours
of your time?"
"Yes," she said readily. "Shall we
stay here?" .
"Now," said Corbin, when he had
brought another chair and they had
sat down together, "tell me about your
summer campaign?"
"Oh"â 7She shrugged her shoul
ders) â "the usual thing â a month in
town and then the usual round of
stupid country places."
"With . dukes and earls dancing a
lively .attendance?" he supplemented.
"Letls not talk of them," she said
quickly. "I am tired to death of titles,
and â dori't" tell mamma, will you? â I'm
glad to get home â foolishly and pathet
ically glad.' Have you been across on
business?" she asked.
"No," he said shortly. "I thought I
went on pleasure."
"Didn't you find the pleasure?" she
said.
"Not exactly," said he. "Very prob
ably I. chose an unfortunate itinerary.
You see, I went to the cathedral at
Cologne again and to that little coffee
house in Antwerp, and I did the gal
leries rat Brussels. It was very un
wise. There were ghosts of too many
hsppy days hanging about. Then I
went to Venice, and the pigeons at St.
Mark's put the finishing touches to my
misery. -I fed the little beggars one
morning â do you remember that other
morning at St. Mark's?"
"Yes," she said, looking across the
sparkling.' water. \ â 
"That was living," he said. "And the
day we lost your mother in Naplesâ do
you recall it?"
She nodded.
"Oh, well," he said resignedly^ "it's

something to have the memory of
those days, anyway."
The girl turned her head slowly.
"So I have discovered," she said.
"Do you ever think of them?" he
asked eagerly. V, V
"Sometimes., For mamma's sake, you
know, I wish I didn't thinK of them so
much," she said.
"They were high old days," he ob
served.
"Weren't they?" she said, Just a hint
of wlstfulness i-> her voice.
: Corbin looked at her searchlngly.
Was she sincere or merely sympathetic?
"I wish that one of two things had

happened," he said impatiently. I
wish we had never found your mother
in Naples that day, or that I had been
born to a title."
"I'm glad that you haven't a title,"
she said.
Corbin sat up suddenly.
"Honestly?" he' asked. *
"Honestly!", she repeated.
"Look here," he said, "if it wasn't for
your mother's ambitions â "
He stooped, hesitated, then reached
over and took her hand.
.. "Polly, dear," he said softly, "I'm
honestly and sincerely aorry to disap
point your mother."
"So am I, but â but I can't help it,"
she said.
For a moment he was lost in
thought.
"I should have persisted that day at
St. Mark'?, shouldn't I?" he asked.
"If I had known," she laughed, "that
you wouldn't have persisted, you dear,
stupid manâ Iâ I should, never have
said 'no.' " . .... . v^ t . . r , ... , : ...
Corbin rose and held out his hand to
help the girl to her feet. ", -
"I think," he said, "we'd better break
the sad news to your mother while
she's still too weak to lecture us."

Suspected Son of ({ambling.
The latest story going the rounds
about George Ade relates to the time
when he was Just coming into rewards
for his literary efforts somewhat great
er than those he had been accustomed
to as a newspaper man in Chicago. Not
knowing what to do with the consider
able sums of money he was receiving
from the royalties on . his fables and
other writings, he sent part of the in
come to his father in Indiana for in
vestment.
The fenior Ade did not marvel much
at the first remittance, for, he had al
ways considered George a frugal boy
and ciie likely to lay by something for
the moisture. But when thousand-dol
lar drafts began to arrive every two or
three weeks he grew anxious ami in the
end suspicious. .Onoday he could stand
the ."train no longer, so .he packed his
valise and starte 1 lor Chicago, saying
gleomily as he â¢lepafted:
"Something must be wrong with
George. lie can't be making all this
money honestly. I'm afraid he's gam

QUACKS IN GERMANY!
In 1902, according to official statistics, j
there were in the whole of Prussia 15,- :
400 doctors and 4104 quacks. The Ger- !
man law makes the practice of the
healing art free to all, although there is j
a penalty for the unauthorized use of [
the title doctor. As a result, quacks j
flourish mightily in a state Justly con- j
sidered in other respects the boly land !
of science.
The evil has become so serious, says
the . New York Globe, that a society
was some time ago formed in Berlin i
for the express purpose of /exposing!
quackery. Under the auspices of this
bedy an exhibition of quackery was
recently held in Breslau, where every
thing pertaining to medical quackery
was exposed â its advertisements, pan
aceas, various methods of treatment,
anti-epidemic masks, universal gastric
juices, bogus electric apparatus, etc.
In the case of one cult the announce
ment was made that during the past
fifteen years its members had collected
from the public" over $3,500,000. One
section of the exhibition was devoted
to methods for suppressing quacks.
RADIUM SUPPLY.
Sir William Ramsay in a recent ad
dress said that few people realize the
great scarcity of the raw material for
yielding radium nor the exceedingly
minute particles used in the experi
ments that have astounded the world.
The Scientific American quotes him as
saying: "It is impossible to say
whither the future supply of raw ma
terial is to come from. 1 believe that
in America, carnotite looks promising
as a basis for it. Cleavite, a mineral
found in Norway, is also looked upon
as a favorable source of supply. That
there is no more than one-tenth of an
ounce of this substance in existence
seems beyond belief at first thought.
But when we remember that radium
is manufactured by a concentration
and crystallizing process, and that it
is only obtained in. the form of salts
which- may contain but a small per
centage of pure radium, this does not
seem so strange, after all- The amount
of radium salts even, ' as yet manu
factured, is very small."
TYPES OF BEGGARS.
Racially the beggar . will belong to
one of three classes; first, the purely
unfortunate; second, the drunken out
cast; third, the professional pan
handler. He of the first class usually
Is forced by circumstance to follow the
line of least resistance into the poorest
and cheapest quarter of the town,
where he wiH not be likely to meet
with his old-time friends, and where
his misery will find sufficient company
to render it unashamed, and so his des
tination will be one of those cheap
lr.dging-houses, where a warm fire and
aii unclean bed may be had for 10 cents
or less a night. The outftist of the
second class is almost without excep
tion brought to his degraded condition
through drink, and he takes to the
lower Bowery impersonally, because it
constitutes his natural environment,
being where the greatest quantity oi
rum Is sold for the least amount or
money, and where a free s'eep may be
had during stormy nights on the rear
room floor of a saloon.
The professional pan-handler of the
third class goes down the Bowery, not
be cause he lives there, for he does not.
but because there he finds sundry re
sorts which 'cater exclusively to his
kind.â "Six Weeks in Beggardom." by-

[7 A prominent club woman, Mrs. Dan- if
forth, of St. Joseph, Mich., tells how she
was cured of falling of the womb and
its accompanying pains and misery by
Lydia E* Pinkham^ Vegetable Compound*
"Dkab Mrs. Pixkham: â life looks dark indeed when a woman
feels that her strength is fading away and she has no hopes of ever
being restored. Such was my feeling a few months ago when I was
advised that my poor health was caused by prolapsus or falling of the
womb. The words sounded like a knell to me, I felt that my sun had
Bet ; but Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound came to me as
an elixir of life ; it restored the lost forces and built me up until my

daily and each dose added health and strength. I am so thankful for
the help I obtained through its use." â Mrs. Florence Danforth,
1007 Miles Ave., St. Joseph, MiclL
A medicine that has restored so many women to health and

BRIDE REFUSES
OAKLAND FLAT
A. Frank Denies Deserting
Wife, but She Would
Not Move Across the Bay
A bride's refusal to live in an Oak
land flat is said to be at the bottom of
the domestic differences of Katharina
Frank and Andrew Frank, a retired
merchant. She sued him for divorce a
few days ago, charging him with de
sertion and alleging that he had 520,000
in t!ie bank. Yesterday he denied the
desertion and the bank account. He
avers that his income is only $65 a
month. They were married on August
20 last, and, finding the plumbing of
thtir home on Clementina .street un
sanitary, he hied across the/bay to find
a new home. On October 13, he says,
he found a flat and sent for his wife,
but she refused to live in Oakland.
In a cross complaint to Maud E. Till's
suit for divorce Arthur Till charges her
with cruelty; says she tried to stab him
with a hat pin, broke 'a vase over hia
head and had a habit of coming home
Intoxicated.
Kate L. Lawler, answering James
Lawler's suit for an annulment
of their marriage at Stockton,
denies that either he or she was drunk
when the ceremony was performed and
says he knew what he was doing.
Judge Hebbard granted a divorce to
Eugene O'Hare from Kathleen O'Hare
on the ground of her intemperance. She
did not appear to defend the case, al
though Fhe had filed an answer saying
that he had accused her of being re
sponsible, by neglect, for the death of
five of their children, all of whom died
between November 17 and 27 of last
year.
Divorces were granted by Judge Heb
bard to LIzette Cook from A. C. Cook,
desertion; Emma Jacobson from Isaac
Jacobson, desertion; by Judge Kerri
gan to Lena H. Orand from Charles F.
Orand, desertion; by Judge Graham to
Emma Gilligan from John Gilligan, de

RACIAL CONFLICT DEVELOPS STORIES
THAT ARE VERY CONTRADICTORY.
Ethiopian's Narrative Clashes With
Tale Unfolded by Asiatic.
Combat in Chinese Restaurant Results in Arrest
of Manager's Afro-A??i37ican Assailants.
BY JAMES C.
"A Chink noodle dump on Jackson
street" was George Washington
Brown's designation of the scene of
conflict, and his fellow defendant, Ja
cob Netherland, alluded to it as "a
chop suey joint." , The prosecuting
policeman enlightened Judge Mogan
with the information that the arrests
were made in a Chinese restaurant.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Netherland, up
to-date young negroes, disclaimed
primal responsibility for the blacken
ing of Hong Ping's eyes and the semi
annihilation of his highly treasured
queue. If he had treated them with,
ordinary courtesy, they averred, there
would not have been any punching or
hair pulling, because they were most
amicably inclined toward him and all
his race when they entered his place
of business. They kept mental mem
oranda of what they ate and his
scheduled prices therefor and when
the overcharge was attempted they
had not accused him of deliberate en
deavor to extort, but kindly requested
him to furnish them with an itemized
bill so that the>\ might prove the de
fectiveness of his arithmetic. Instead
of acceding to that very reasonable
request he flew into violent passion
and threatened to slay them if they
did not pay the sum he demanded.
"En all mah bo'n days, Jedge,"
said Mr. Brown, "ah nebbah saw sech
an angrifled pusson as dat Chink. He
wuz bilin' mad, an' w'en Mistah Neth
erland tried ter p'int out dat we
wuzn't out fo' no trubble he grew
wuss an' wussah, callin' boaf ob us
dead beats an' oddah derpreshiatin'
names dat no gen'lm'n kin stan'.
Ter mek mattahs still mo' wussah, a
dozen oddah Chinks stud a-eggin' him.
on an' a-helpin' him po' de insultery
inteh us. Et wuz a case ob flght ou'
way out, Jedge, or stay dah an' be
cahved wif knives, an' we fit ou' way
out- Dat am de sollem fucks ob de
case, yo' Honnah."
Mr. Netherland corroborated every
word of Mr. Brown's statement, but
every word of it was emphatically
contradicted by Hong Ping/ who swore
that the defendants audaciously tried
to evade payment of any sum at all.
When they sought to sneak out he
undertook to restrain them and while
one of them systematically put his
eyes in mourning the .other tried to
uproot his queue.
More testimony will be heard next
Saturday.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Five full-bloded Greeks, accused of
peddling without license, were regis
tered on Judge Cabaniss' calendar as
Mike Cuddy, Joe Corbett, Pat Smith
ers, Timothy Griffin and A. R. Cullen
and his Honor gasp'ed and blinked. as
he alternately glanced from the ros
ter to the defendants. Clerk Barney
Conlan surveyed the swart quintet
with baleful eye and Prosecuting At
torney Hanley's stare at them was
menacing.
"Of course," said Mr. Hanley to the
bench, "these defendants are not of
the nationality that these names
would indicate, for not one of them
can speak the English language."
"The names are rank counterfeits,
your Honor," snapped Clerk Conlan,
"and I'd like to know by what right
these dagoes should have adopted
such names."
" 'A. P. Cullen,';" mused the Judge
scanning the calendar; "now I'd like
.to know what "A. P.' stands for."
"Alphonsus Patrick," promptly ex
claimed the defendant alluded to.
Mr. Conlan collapsed in his chair, Mr.
Hanley clutched wildly at the clerk's
desk as he staggered backward. Bailiff
Neil Carmichael chuckled' and the
Judge's fingers were In his hair as he
moaned:
"Take them away. This nomen
clatural mystery is too profound to be
solved in a day. Bring them back on
the 22d." '
Four Intoxicated and disorderly Jap
anese men were gallantly breasting the
Pine street hill, between Dupont and
Stockton, when a member of the China
town squad undertook to scale the ac
clivity and discipline them. When they
saw him climbing they formed a square
that would have been hollow had it not
environed a fire plug, but three of them
retreated Lefore his fierce onslaught,
the fourth bravely holding his ground
while he endeavored to uproot the plug,
his evident intention being to utilize it
as a defensive weapon. The quartet
were overpowered and manihed down
the hill again, and Judge Conlan will
sentence them to-day.

CRAWFORD, t
that Joseph, her . husband, was In
steady receipt of $18 a week for his
services as a Iaundryman,' but instead
ofsupporting her and their three young
children with the money he spent near
ly all of it for ready-made clothing, for
himself. Their home at 530 Alabama
street was chock full of hand-me-down
garments," but no food would be pur
chased or rental paid if she did not de
vote her scanty earnings as a laundress
to those lines of expenditure. While
she was ashamed of the raiment worn
by the little ones and herself, Joseph
was ever a glass of fashion. He read
all the clothiers' advertisements In the
daily newspapers while he was at home,
and when . not at home or at work he
could surely be found In some apparel
shop inspecting and trying on the lat
est things in ready-made suits. Since
last June his contributions to the
household fund had not exceeded a to
tal, of $25, and during. that period he
must have spent ten times that amount
of money In sartorial dissipation. Could
not the court persuade or compel him
td remember his domestic responsibili
ties?
The court thought Joseph ought to be
ashamed of himself. While a passion
for stylish attire was less reprehensible
than a craving for strong waters, lt
was difficult to see how Joseph's family
was benefited by- the distinction. Jo
seph must understand that the first
duty of a paterfamilias- was to his wife
and children, even to the deterioration
of his 'personal aspect, and if he does
not immediately begin buying: more
food and firing and other household
necessaries he will soon find himself de
prived of opportunity to buy anything,
for in the County Jail there are neither
pay days nor clothing stores. â¢
Joseph Curran complained to a po
liceman that he had been robbed of a
revolver by J. Lodiare, liquor dealer at
121 Sixth street, and w'hen the officer
accompanied Mr. Curran to Mr. Lo
diare's store he found that the pistol
was commandeered because it had been
brandished threateningly by Mr. C. in
the face of Mr. L.. during a dispute orer
some small change. So instead of ar
resting Mr. Lodiare the policeman ar
rested Mr. Curran and booked him for
carrying a deadly weapon, of which
charge he was pronounced guilty by
Judge Conlah.
With due respect to the court, Mrs.
Alice O'Brien would prefer to plead her
own case. It was in no spirit of con
tumacy that she declined Judge Ca
baniss' offer to appoint a professional
advocate in her behalf. Confident of
the righteousness of her cause and of
the uprightness of the bench, she did
not fear the outcome of her trial, nor
did she believe that any lawyer could
improve the defense which she was pre
pared to submit.
"I don't want to have any of them
shysters, talkln* for me," said Mrs.
O'Brien, "and If it's all the same to
your Honor I'll do my own arguing."
It i was all the same to his Honor, and
the examination proceeded. Patrolman
W. P. Monaghan testified that Mrs.
O'Brien's small saloon, at 8 Kate street,
off Bryant and between Seventh and
Eighth, was a hotbed of disorder, to
the great annoyance of her neighbors,
many of whom had audibly marveled
that the law did not protect them.
"To show your Honor that no such
complaints have been made," said Mrs.
O'Brien, "I'll now call my chief wit
ness, Mrs. Julia Ballinger, who lives
right opposite my little place, to say if
she ever heard a voice above a whisper
comin* from me or my customers, and
I'm sure she'll tell the truth, for there's
no woman I know who has a better
reputation for rhindln* her own busi
ness and tellin' the truth tfian Mrs.
Ballinger, and after your Honor has
heard what she has to say I'm sure you
will take her word and let the police
man know that â "
"Call Mrs. Ballinger!" shouted the
Judge.
. Mrs. Ballinger, a rosy-faced young
matron, fulfilled Mrs. O'Brien's expec
tation to the letter. How any one who
did not want to hurt a poor lone widow
trying to make an honest living could
say that Mrs. O'Brien kept a disorderly
house was more than Mrs. Ballinger
could understand. Although in prox
imity to the premises In question morn
ing, noon and night, she (Mrs. B.) had
never once heard or seen anything
about Mrs. O'Brien's management of
her business discreditable to that lady's
respect for the law of the land and the
comfort of her neighbors. There were
some people on earth, however, that an
angel from above could not please.

Violet Monnier Tells of Al
leged Effort to Kill Her
and Her- Two Children
OBJECTS TO TESTIMONY
Counsel for Defense Tries
to Exclude Evidence Ke
lating to Dire Threats
Violet Monnier, wife of George Mon
nier Jr., the contestant for a share in
the estate of his father, the late wine
dealer, testified yesterday in Judge
Graham's, court as to the al
leged attempt by v Mrs. Monnier Sr.
to poison her and her two children at
the Monniers' home in May, 1902. At
the time both children and the mother
vrere visiting the house, and after eat
ing were taken sick. The baby boy
went into convulsions and was sick for
a long time afterward. Violet Monnier
and the little girl, Flossie, were slclc
two weeks. Thephysicans who were
summoned treated them for poisoning.
Several sharp arguments passed be
tween Attorneys Roche and Collins
during the testimony as to the poison
ing. Collins objected to the introduc
tion of the testimony, but was overrul
ed by the court. The witness later
testified that Mrs. Monnier made fur
ther threats to poison the three in the
presence of Policeman Curtis, who had
been called in to quell a disturbance
in the Monnier home.
Violet Monnier told of her Relations
with the elder Monniers after her mar
riage with their son. According to her
statements, while Monnier Sr. was
passive in his opposition, his wife was
a great trouble maker. The witness
testified that after the birth of her sec
ond child the elder Mrs. Monnier took
care of him during the young wife's
stay in the hospital, and that when
she left the hospital she had to resort
tc stratagem to get her child back.
The witness said that efforts were
continually being made to separate her
from her husband, and that when she
was very sick she was served first with
papers to annul her marriage and later
with papers in divorce proceedings.
The divorce was in the name of her
husband, but tluring the trial it was
proved that George Monnier was living
with his wife and that the proceed
ings were instigated by Mrs. Mon
nier Sr.
The witness declared that when she
went to visit her husband at the
French Hospital he seemed afraid of
her and that she had to calm him be
fore he would speak to her. She fur
ther said that when she was in the
hospital George Monnier Sr. supplied
the money for her expenses and that
he often gave the grandchildren
money.
Attorney Collins questioned Violet
Monnier as to her meeting with the
Monniers and her marriage with
George. She told of her meetings with
Mrs. Monnier before the marriage, all
of which were pleasant; but after the
marriage Mrs. Monnier said that she
was not George's wife and that the
marriage was illegal.
Dr. F. Canac Marquis of the Frencn
Hospital testified as to young . Mon
nier's stay at the hospital, where i he
was treated for tuberculosis. Collins
tried to make the witness say that dis
sipation caused aggravations of the
disease, but failed.
Several other witnesses testified as
to the elder Monnier's kind treatment
of his 'son during) the bov's childhood.
The case will go on Monday morning
at 10 o'clock. Â«
Teachers on Absence IJeave.
The Board of Education announced
that teachers with leaves of absence
until the beginning of the spring term
will not be required to return to their
classes until January 16 next. By the
adoption of a recent resolution the
spring term's commencement was ad
vanced from January 3 to January 16
and the board fears that teachers may
wish to return to duty at the earlier
date. Leaves of absence were granted
to Rose de Yoe, May Arnold and Alice
McNeely, and teachers' certificates to
E. I. Rowell, Charlotte Martin, Mrs.
Kate Delaney, Margaret Nesfleld and
E. J. Dupuy.

AFTER INVESTIGATION CRESCEUS' TIME THROWN OUT BY TROTTING OFFICIALS
CRESCEUS' MILE
IS NOT ALLOWED
Track Ofiicials Are All
Ruled Off for the Part
Thev Played in the Case
KETCHAJI EXONERATED
Evidence Not Sufficiently
Strong to Establish His
Connection With Fraud
CHICAGO, Dec. 8.â George R. Ketch
am of Toledo was found not guilty of
establishing a fraudulent record for his
trotting stallion Cresceus at the Wich
ita, Kans., track on October 19, 1903,
after a hearing of the case to-night be
fore the board of appeals of the Ameri
can Trotting Association. The board
declared that the evidence fell short of
sufficiency in establishing criminal par
ticipation in the claimed fraudulent
agreement for an illegitimate record so
far as Mr. Ketcham was concerned.
"The story detailed by Starter Jor
dan of thr : Wichita track, who declared
to the board that Mr. Ketcham had ar
ranged with him to fix the time of Cres
cena bo that the world's mile record
vuuld be broken," the decision declares,
"is not without considerable corrobora
tion in matters of minor detail. We
must, however, view the case before us
wholly from the evidence we have that
the chief factor has certainly convict
ed himself of falsehood, and especially
in view of the sweeping and- unequivo
cal denial of direct or indirect partici
pation made by Mr. Ketcham, we must
determine that the evidence fails to es
tablish his connection with the fraud
and intrigue lying at the foundation of
this attempted record."
While freeing Mr. Ketcham from the
charge, the board found the officials of
the Southern Kansas Fair Association,
on whoso track the race was run,
guilty of connivance to establish a
fraudulent record, and expelled from
the American Trotting Association
President C. H. Irwin and all the other
officials connected with the Wichita
track at that time.
OFFICIALS ARE PUNISHED
The persons expelled by the board
besides Mr. Irwin were S. B. Amidon,
judge; A. C. Jordan. Fred Stearnes and
H. T. Eamcs. all of whom were found
by the board to have participated in
the announcement and establishment of
the fraudulent record of the horse
Cresceus. The expulsion of these of
ficials also means that the world's rec
ord for trotting stallions of 1:5954,
claimed to have been made by Cres
ceus, is not allowed by the board. In
the decision on the case the board says
in part:
"Leaving out of consideration entire
ly the last affidavit made by Mr. Jor
dan, detailing what he now claims to
be the truth of the entire transaction.
fo far at least as> the statements made
therein affect any person other than
himself, and relying alone on the con
tradictory statements under oath made
by Messrs. Amidon, Stearnes, Jordan,
Eames and Irwin, not only as to the
time made and the details of the per
formance, but also and particularly as
to the manifest effort shown to estab
lish what must have been known by
Messrs Irwin and Amidon as an abso
lutely irregular and unlawful meeting
for the record purpose, we are forced to
the unavoidable conclusion that each
of the persons named has within but a
little more than a year made absolutely
irreconcilable and contradictory state
ments of the facts necessary to the
regularity of the meeting, and even the
approximate correctness of the time
made. From the several affidavits the
conclusion is irresistible that not only
was the meeting irregular, but the at
tempt to give the horse such a record
was a gross fraud upon the public and
a willful violation of the rules of the
American Trotting Association.
RECORD IS THROWN OCT.
"All controversy over the regularity
of the performance and the correctness
of the time claimed is forever set at
rest by Mr. Ketcham's authorized
statement, through his attorney, made
to-day before the board, in which he
unequivocally states that he is satisfied
from the evidence before the board
that the horse Cresceus did not make
the mile in 1:59% at Wichita, Kans.,
October 19. 1903, and that he is not en
titled to the credit for the performance
of any record arising therefrom; that
the announcement of such time then
and there made was fraudulently done
and was false; that Cresceus is not en
titled to the record, and Mr. Ketcham
does not want it under existing circum
stances." f \.;i'.*~':

CLAUDE IS BEATEN
BY MISTY'S PRIDE
Oregon Mare<12 to 1
in Betting Ring.
FOSSIL BADLY ODTSPRINTED
Silent Water the Lone
â¢ Favorite to Win.
BY FRED E. MULHOLL.AXD.
Owner M. J. Daly's Claude, a many
time Derby winner, had his pride
humbled in a sprinting race" yester
day at Oakland. The bay horse was
compelled to bow in submission before
Misty's Pride, the speedy Oregon
bred mare. This innocent looking
purse event, which was fourth on the
card and decided at six furlongs, was
prolific of considerable class. Among
the other entries were Fossil, Iridius
and Padua. Fossil and Claude were
each quoted at 11 to 5 in the first bet
ting, but as the latter has had the
eyes of the dockers bulging out of
their sockerts by his llights of speed
in morning workouts, he closed favor
ite at 3 to 2. Toward the close of the
betting a drizzling play on Misty's
Pride cut the mares price from 10
and 12 down to 7*2. The favorite
lacked early speed and this accom
plished his defeat, for Eddie Dominick
got him away third from the barrier.
â¢Big Bill" Knapp on Misty's Pride
went off sailing in the lead and the
pace she set had the others all tip
toeing it.
FOSSIL. LACKS SPEED.
Fossil was lamentably lacking in
speed, while Iridius trailed the leader
into the stretch. Claude, under vigor
ous riding, passed the Jennings entry,
but could not quite get up to the lit
tle chestnut mare, which beat him
out a short neck in 1:13& Iridius
finished third, a neck before Fossil.
Followers of the favorites had
slight surcease from sorrow, as Silent
Water was the one choice to land.
The odds about the filly were so scant
that little relief was afforded them.
While the card did not wear a pre
possessing look, if one number could
t>e excepted, the attendance and bet
tins were good.
Bookmaker Billy Engstrom's recent
purchase Jerusha won the opening
event, going to the post second choice
in the betting. Davis piloted the filly,
and, in a driving finish, she beat Lily
Golding out nearly a length. Lady
Goodrich, played from 12 down to 7,
1 an a fair third. Saccharate, the
mount of Bullman, -was installed fa
vorite. It was the first start this sea
son of the filly, and after displaying a
nice turn of speed she fell back.
For lack of better-looking material,
Scotsman was made favorite for the
mile and hundred yard selling affair.
Harry Michaels, who rode the Brink
worth entry, permitted Sam Green
field, on Profitable, to steal away too
far in front, with a result that the
outsider reached the â¢wire first by
nc-ariy a length. Vaughan ran third,
three lengths behind the favorite. The
odds about the winner were played
from 15 and 20 down to 6.
ALONE FINISHES FIRST.
Another outsider came to the sur
face in the Futurity course spin for
two-year-olds, next decided. Almost
any one of the nine starters could be
doped a chance, and at 3% to 1 The
Gadfly closed favorite. The colt does
not call for much and was never dan
gerous. Travers, astride Alone, a
slightly backed 15 to 1 shot, gave his
field the slip early and, hard pressed
at the finish, led Mogregor out half a
length. Loague landed the 100 to 1
shot Herthus in the show.
Owners resorted to the scratching
blank liberally in the fifth event, until
the field was reduced to eight starters.
This left Bob Smith's Silent Water a
top-heavy favorite, and in a fierce
drive Sam Greenfield kept the brown
filly going just long enough to get a
rose verdict over The Lieutenant. The
show went to Maxtress, a 15 to 1
chance, ridden by Travers. â¦
Michaels rode J. V. Kirby, favorite
for the concluding mile and fifty yard
event, and the horse made a miserable
showing. Badly Used, the only entry
whose odds were .played down, de
feated Meistersinger and Homage with
apparent ease.
TRACK NOTES.
Bob Smith's apprentice Greenfield is
riding in his best form. Sam carried
oft the honors yesterday by piloting
two winners. ;â .
Walter Jennings sold Isabutte to Dr.
Fitzgerald, the well-known veterinary,
after the filly ran unplaced in the race
won by Silent Water.
Jay Ransch is in the city after an
other successful season of riding on
the French turf. Jay is on his way to
his Bakersfield home and will prob
ably do no riding in California.
Tony Barrett's long-distance cam
paigner Barrack arrived in a car from
I/Os. Angeles last evening.
Badly Used won a race at the Port
land, meeting with the syndicate ring
laying SO to 1 against his chances.
The gelding was played down to 8 and
10 to 1 and earned a nose decision.
Xapa Stock Farm has secured first
call on the services of John Bullman.

filly Arisbe in her races. Bill Carroll

BRITT TRIES
ROUGH TACTICS
He Shows Great Speed, hut
Is Preparing- to Beat the
Dane at His Own Game
PRACTICING WRESTLING
The Californian Has Some
Strenuous Times on the
Mat With Charley Kreling
"Nelson Is only a human being. He
can be beaten down just like the rest
of them, and I think I am the man to
do the work. This talk about a tough
man is more rumor than anything
else. One man will tell you Nelson is
tough; another hears of it, and along
the line It goes. I admit he ia tough,
but there is always some one who can
put the finishing wallop on such a
chap."
This is the philosophy of Jimmy
Britt. He believes what he says and
is earnest when he utters such a state
ment. He has set his heart on con
quering the boxer whom every one ad
mits is the Hardesl one in the business
to wear down. He has faith In his
ability to leave the ring victorious
over the lad who made Corbett, Ca
nole, Herrera, Hanlon and Welch
strike their colors.
Britt is conditioning himself for a
severe fight. He is devoting most ot
his time to wrestling, tugging and
shoving men away in the clinches. He
has speed enough, but what he wants
to develop is ability to outrough a
rough man in the clinches and at the
same time send in a few punches that
will turn the tide of victory in his fa
vor.
His work yesterday was fast and
rough while it lasted. As usual he
took to the highways In the morning
and did a faithful jog of more than
ten miles. A plunge in the inviting
surf came next, then a rubdown.
luncheon and a nap that made him
come around fresh and full of energy
for his gymnasium work.
He started In by breaking the rope
of his punching bag. Then he hooked
up wfth Frank Rafael and during the
four rounds that ensued many telling
blows were struck by the champion.
He played for the body almost contin
ually, using his right and left in rap
id succession. A few times Rafael
was on the point of reclining on the
carpet, so fast and so steady was the
volley of wallops coming.
Britt paid particular attention to
the clinches and always made it a
point to rough it. He showed his
strength here and invariably came out
of the mixups much to the good and
always in position to shoot in another
punch. This sort of work seemed to
please the select attendance, though
there were a few who were thought
ful enough to make some comments
on how Britt really should fight.
"Tlv" Kreling next engaged Jimmy
in one long round of wrestling and
tugging. The pair squirmed and
struggled all over -the mat and
neither was willing to give an inch-
Little attention was paid to punching:
it was the wrestling and tugging that
held their attention. When this was
over Britt took another dip in the
ocean and then began to think about
his monologue turn, which he will
present to-day at the benefit for the
Theatrical Managers' Association.
Britt will do no gymnasium work
this afternoon.
Harry Sharpe of St. Louis will ref
eree the preliminary bouts on the
night of the Britt-Xelson engagement.
Mr. Sharpe officiated at all the box
ing championships in St. Louis this
year, Eugene Van Court of the
Olympic Club pronounces him one of
the cleverest referees he has ever seen
in the ring.
Nelson's forfeit of $2000 and the To
semite Club's forfeit of an equal amount
were posted last night with Harry Cor
bett. Britt is expected to post his to
day when he comes into town.

SAFER VESSELS
FOR ALL HANDS
Navy's Inspection .Protects
the Owners, Crews and
Passengers of Steam Craft
TEST ],IFE PRESERVERS
Water-Tight Compartments
Suggested for Ferries
on the Trans-Bay Route
The lesson of the Slocum disaster in
New York harbor last summer has
been a bitter one, but it has borne an
aftermath of good results. Some months
ago the Secretary of the Navy author,
ized a general inspection of passenger
craft plying in American waters and in
the foreign trade. Retired officers of
the navy were requested to aid in this
important work, and for the Paclflc
Coast district Rear Admiral Louis
Kempff, retired, was detailed to collect
da!ta that will be valuable in determin
ing what is best for passenger and
shipowner.
The investigation is by no means a
sensational effort to place the blame
for "lack of life-saving facilities," says
the. admiral, but a businesslike inquiry
for the betterment of the passenger
service of steamshiping. The investi
gation so far as the port of San Fran
cisco is concerned is nearly at an end,
but there are all the northern and
southern ports to visit and a large fleet
of vessels in each to inspect. Admiral
Kempff has inspected about eighty-five
vessels of all sizes in San Francisco
harbor, including the ferry-boats that
ply between this city and the east bay
side. The inspection, generally speak
ing, has been very satisfactory, and the
only recommendation that the admiral
at present feels necessary to impress
upon owners is that it would be well to
divide the hulls of the boats into
watertight compartments and to line
certain parts of the vessels with sheet
iron to protect them against possible
flre originating in the carelessness of
crews.
Admiral Kempff has instituted a
practical test of life-preservers used on
passenger steamers. At the Appraiser's
building he has floated several pre
servers in a tank with weights at
tached to determine the effect of water
upon the cork or tule "fillings." Fire
drills have been tried out with crews
of bay and ocean vessels, and the hose
used on shipboard has been subjected
to rigid examination.
Admiral Kempff and the inspectors
of hulls and boilers think that the plan
inaugurated will result in great benefit
to the merchant marine service. In ail
the inspection districts of the country
rimilar inspections have been cavri*.d
cut by naval officers, who, like Admiral
Kempff. are thoroughly equipped iv.
natural intelligence and techi-ical
knowledge of the work they have un
dertaken, which will bring about ex
celient results.
SECURES ALTERNATIVE WRIT.â The Su
preme Court has granted an alternative writ
of prohibition in favor of Joseph Rebstok,
who wishes Judge Lawlor restrained from fur
ther action in the election frauds case In which
the petitioner Is defendant. n?b3tock claims
the Superior Court has no jurisdiction In the
caso. since he was compelled to testify against
himself at the Gra"ftd Jury Investigation. The
Suprem* Court will hear the arguments Mon

THE COFFEE OITTLOOK.
Crop Prospect* and Probable Require- i
ments.
The New Torfc circular of Henry Ncrdlinger
.A Co. Â«*is:
"It is most astonishing that some Brazilian
exporter* should repeat the folly of previous
year* in c*bllr4j crap estimates when the flow
ering of the tree* Is only Just completed. It is
abcut the Fair.e iiropofltion as estimating an
t;; :*â  crop immediately after the blossoming
period. How v&luelefl* estimates at the pres
ent time arÂ« is shown by their wide range,
cuch ertinuiteÂ» running from 7% to 12 mil
. lion b&c& for theÂ«19%Â»-O6 cr- ;â¢ In looking
over our filet we find that whenever estimates
Â«>f the following- year's' crop of coffee were
Civen as early es this, they were invariably
million* of b&ea out of the way, belr.s either
ico high or too low by that rr.uch.
â¢"lt ;â¢ utterly in^possible for Brazilians to
Â£tvm en approxin-.ately reliablo eetimate of their
..;op at this time. Even *.t iate at March or
April, mhen the picking season begins, the
<â .: ::â¢*â¢ t (and we include the mott honor
â¢iblÂ« and conservative houses) have in s.>me
;.Â»-arÂ» erred to the extent of millions of bags
:n thÂ»;r estimates. We repeat that no atten
tion should be paid to estimates at this time
whether they are large or email; It is safer
10 take the actions of the market In the pro
ducing country, or s-?riÂ» otlwr guiding feature.
â¢ s a basis irozn which to Craw conclusions.
ThÂ« plaxters. tf anybody. Â«ight to know what
thÂ« prospecia are with legaf-d to their growing
crop, and If the Rio crop really promises to
' he an extraordinary large one, as onÂ« of the
cables received her* la*t month has It, it
would be natural to suppose that the planters
1n Rio and Minaa wuuld hurry forward every
fr>ag of coffee they have left on their planta
tions at the present remunerative vaiuee. The
rÂ»"cÂ«>tptÂ» in Rio on the contrary, however, were
exceptionally email last month and for that
matter have *o been during the entire period
of ordinary heavy movements to ports. It is
.furthermore to be remarked upon that the
price in Bio has not been Influenced in the
least by the fluctuation* in the speculative
markets of Europe and the United States, but
has remained continuously â  firm. These fea
-tureÂ« to our mind indicate tha.t while the
prospect* are for a. larger* 15Â»O5-u6 Rio crop
.than the exceptionally small one of the cur
rent fiscal year. It will not be & record crop
by any means. On the other hand, the tree*
iti liit state of Sao Paulo arÂ» in euch a de
rlcrsile condition that it is more than likely
that the Eantos cros will be much less next
year than this â how much less, cannot be de
termined until come time next epring.
THE STATISTICAL POSITION.
"We *till have seven months of the current
crop year ahead of us, and if the consump
tion during that time equals that of the cor
r*Bpond:ng period of the previous tbreÂ« years,

ViO.uOu bags lee* coffee than we have now, or
'â¢bout 2.0UU.O00 bags lees than was existing on
;he Crtt of July this year. This reduction in
-.;â 'â¢ visible supply will be due solely to the re
cuced crci>Â« of Brazil.
â¢'If v;e start next season with such a re
6~re& supply Â«-nd the following year's crop is
n<n larger than the present one. a further re
ducticn in the visible supply during 1905-06
â¢ I sboct the same magnitude can reasonably
. tÂ»- calculated on. This would then bring the
\ ip:bie supply of the world on the first of
July. U0Q, to something below S.Suu.OGO bags,
bs agsiatt 14.250,000 bags existing now.
â¢â¢-r rrieads in Brazil still claim that the
: â  'â¢ !'.;o *rd Santos crop will prove not to
exceed '.'.000,000 bags. Cables received here
" lately from Santos are to the effect that most
Â«.â : the large plantation* have virtually shipped
< ut their entire crop, and that only a very
Fmail percentage is left on the other planta
tions in that state. If this is correct, then
tba estimates of our friends would not be ex
c*Â«ied. We believe, however, that in accord
l:. âº with the receli-ts eo far la, and having
dac regard for the causes which brought out
tr.is cc5e* Irosn the Santos plantations in
*uch ij.rge mearure at eo early a time, the
crcp will turn out to be nearer 8,500,000 bats
aad this Is the bawis on which wÂ« have as
â¢bora calculated the expâ¬Cted reduction in the
v;?!b'.e eujiply.
"A very 6tranjre feature, and one that is
;/jzzilng eotne operator* here, is the fact, that
Kurope which during the first five months of
:^.e crop year usually purchased In Brazil
I m 3.M0,000 to 4,00O.00(J bags of coffee, has
'!".!Â« year not taken more than 2.250,000 bags

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 8â A violent squall
swept over the stock market to-day, which
wrought havoc while it lasted, but which was
d^sipated almost as quickly as it came. Com
pare<l with the stormy scenes of the day the
final market was as I'lacid as a summer lake
ar..l the buying of stocks was going on as
systematically as though no disturbance had
occurred. A review of the day's net changes
reveals not a few gains, and even the worst
or the losses are confined to moderate pro
portions. Unfortunately for ttaose who sold
their stocks, either from fright at the crum
bling tendency of price* or from, necessity to
repay borrowed money, the final prices of the
day by no means represented the prices at
which the largest part of the day's sales were
miAe. There was a time during the market
when there was no apparent demand for stacks
at any price. Orders to sell a few hundred
shares could oaly be executed at concessions
ot 1 to 3 points from the preceding sale. Such
haste and confusion characterized the selling
that the same Ftock sold simultaneously only
a few feet arart at variations of $2 U> $3 a
share. There was no such frantic fluctuations
as that in Northern Pacific on May Â», 1901.
owing to the corner which existed in that
stock, but otherwise the movements in the
market resembled those on that day and thi
day's total Miles of 2,905,400 shares compare
with 3.081.700 on May Â», 1901. The day un
doubtedly will go down in the history of the
Stock Exchange as one of those In which
the assuran<v> which usually sustains men in
action on p:f conceived determinations deserted .
them and they did things under the influence '
of unrea*on!ne panic. A list of some of the
day's, extreme decline* is the best evidence
of this fact, taken In connection with the sub
sequent almost complete recoveries when rea
son had reasserted its control. Colorado Fuel
and Iron fell an extreme 11*4, Amalcamated
Copper 10, Tennessee Coal 9U. Lake Erie and
Western SÂ»*, St. Paul 7"*. Brooklyn Rapid
Transit 7*Â«. I'nited States Steel preferred 7%,
Si Louis Southwestern 7. Sugar 6%, United
States Steel 6H. Union Pacific 5Vi. Missouri
Pacific 5>-. Metrojxilitan Street Railway 5%.
Metropolitan Securities 5*i. Consolidated Gas
5 1 *. Louisville and Nashville 4%. and many
others le&ser amounts. These low prices rep
resented a drop from the high level of this
week on Monday of such figures as 24 for
Amalgamated Copper, 21 for Colorado Fuel,
loH for Tennessee Coal, 11 for United States
Steel preferred. 11 % for Union Pacific, 14Vi
for Sugar. 12% for Brooklyn Transit and 12
for St. Paul. The rabidity and violence of
this shrinkage of values abundantly accounts
for the fears aroused by lenders of money on
stock collateral and the urgent demands fot
additional margins sent out by brokers carry
ing stocks for customers. There was un
doubtedly some sudden discrimination against
the character of collateral which added to th*
stringency of the situation. The source of
the Felling was not accurately known, and It
seemed to come from widely distributed
sources. It was somewhat remarkable that
reports of financial embarrassments did not
get afloat at any time during the break. The
call money rate went slightly above the sea
son's previous maximum, but as- everybody was
liquidating loans the actual supply of cash
was being replenished instead of depleted.
The Bevere break In the foreign exchange
market reflected a quick resort to that source
of relief, and there were large offerings of
bankers' finance Mil* In that market. Lon- '
don's heavy absorption of our stocki on the
break also made a large supply of exchange.
The same was true of foreign purchases of
cotton and grain on the break In those mar
kets under the reflected pressure from the
stock market. The extreme weakness of
Amalgamated Copper had a reflex effect in
the market for copper, both here and In Lon
don. Th<Â»re 'was the usual gathering of
â¢"bargain-hunters" on any severe break in
prices cf stocks, and there was' evidence of
investment buying of a more substantial and
sustained character. The first violent recov
eries were due to the scramble among the
triumphant bear* to cover their short con
tracts, but the more substantial buying sus
tained the market well to the strong closing.
The Improvement in the health of the market
by reason of sweeping out of weak holders
was obvious in late dealings. There was no
â erious consideration of news developments,
the e?ecu?atlve inflation and its rupture being
held to account for the break.
The bond market was affected In sympathy
with stocks, but- in less degree. Total sales,
par value. X3,211.0O0:
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

CHICAGO. BOARD OF TRADE..
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Dec .S.^-Wheat at the opening
was weak. May being unchanged to Uo lower
at $1 10% to $1 10%. One influence tending to
create bearish sentiment was continued liberal
receipts in ths. NorUÂ»v:<?stÂ« Another factor was
a report of excellent harvest weather in Ar
gentina. The effect of yesterday's heavy liqui
dation was In evidence early in the day, .and
with little support the market became still
weaker. Shortg covered freely on the slump,
but before the decline was checked May had
told off to $1 On'.,. The sensational break In
Wall street is itaid to have Induced much sell
ing of wheat here.. Toward the middle cf the
day, however, the wheat market rallied sharp
ly on liberal purchases by a leader of the
longs.- The early loss was quickly regained
and prices showed good gains over initial
quotations. On an excellent general demand
the market held strong throughout the re
mainder of the session. An unconfirmed report
of large sales of flour at Minneapolis was re
sponsible for much of the late bullishness.
Another factor was the strength of wheat at
St. Louis. Shortly before the close May
reached $1 11%, the highest point of the day.
Final quotations were at $1 1115.
Trading in corn was on a fairly generous
ecale, and the market ruled firm the entire
day. May opened a shade to li(8%c higher
at 44%c to 44%c, sold between 44 %c and 44%Â®
41";c and closed at 44%c.
Decreased receipts had a strengthening .in
fluence in the oats market. May opened un
changed at :m";' h c. sold between 3oi;c and 30%c
and closed at 30%c.
Liquidation of' scattered holdings caused.

Butter, Cheese and Errs.
Butter and Eggs are both very gteady owing
largely to the clear, cold weather, which checks
the production and increases â¢ the consumption,
and an additional source of strength to But
ter is the receipt of some orders for the north.
Some dealers quoted 22c yesterday, but the'
majority opposed any advance, saying that it j
would at once shut off all shipping orders, 1
and that If the possible rain predicted by the '
Weather Bureau occurred the market would
Immediately weaken off again. . All dealer*
agreed, however, that if the demand were up j
to the average prices would advance, but it 1
continues very slow. The medium and lower 1
grades have been In the best demand lately.
The situation in Eggs Is similar to that in !
Butter. Receipts of ranch continue light and i
the cold weather helps the market, but pos
sible rains were predicted .yesterday, and this !
had a tendency to check Tiny upward move- |
ment. At -the same time the top quotation j
was obtained in numerous Instance*. Some I
store Eggs came In and sold at 2Sc. but this I
description is no longer a factor In the market. â¢
Cheese rules weak and the receipts yester- !
day were larger than for some time. The I
market is weak and dull and dealers are dis
posed to sell. i i
Receipts were 37,400 lbs Butter. 431 cases â¢

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Aside from a fair movement In medium
priced Apples there was very little doing in
the fruit market, as the coo! weather restricted ;
trade in Citrus lines and Grapes and there was !
no movement to speak of In shipping channels. J
Receipt* of Apples were much lighter than !
usual, only tw 0 cars being received froro the '
north, tut the market was still heavily bur
dened with fancy stock, which dragged badly. I
Stocks of Grapes were light, but the demand i
waa likewise* and prices of small packages
ranged lower. Strawberries and Raspberries
' were mostly poor. Cranberries were slow of :
sale, with large stocks on hand. Tropical !
fruits were in good supply and moved slowly |
at the old quotations. ' 1

Dried Fruits, Xuts, Raisins, Honey.
Honey continues dull, with the local market
well supplied with Nevada. The Los Angeles
Herald says:
"In Southern California, the season's crop of
Honey has proved a complete failure, aa the '
output is reported by competent authority to i
have been only five carloads. In the San j
Joaquln Valley the Honey crop Is placed at 100
carloads. The old crop Is all In second handa !
practically and is going eastward from 6%@7c j
a pound for Water White. The new crop of !
the valley produce is being marketed at 4%9 I
4Â»,c a pound. Demand for Comb Honey Is 1
steady, as this Is the consuming season, and I

DOLBEER TRIAL
SOON TO END
The proponents In the Dolbeer wm
contest announced i^psterday that they
would close on Monday or Tuesday.
The trial will probably be ended the
latter Dart of the week. The adjourn

Fight was given when Judge Coffey
facetiously expressed alarm in discuss
ing the question of whether or not to
go on to-day.
The strongest testimony in behalf of
the will has been reserved to the last.
â Witnesses have covered a very wide
range to show that Bertha Dolbeer
never exhibited signs of insanity. Yes
terday there was testimony that struck
home to the issue in the contestâ was
Miss Dolbeer mentally incompetent
when she executed the will on April 23,
1904? The question was answered by
Miss Bertha Wilcoxen. the trained
nurse who was in constant attendance
on the testatrix, emphatically in the
negative.

HEALTH WAS GOOD.
Miss Wilcoxen had been, caring for
Miss Dolbeer for ten days prior to April
23. â¢ The testatrix was taking the rest!
cure in preparation for her trip to Eu- j
rope and to recover from the fatigue i
an active social season had induced. I
Her health was so good, however, that
Miss Wilcoxen suggested a number of
times that there was no need of em
ploying a nurse. But Miss Dolbeer said ;
she liked to have the witness about her ;
for company and wished to retain her;
the few days remaining before her de- j
parture for Europe. i
While Miss Dolbeer I was taking the :
rest cure her appetite indicated no ill ,
health. She had eggs and either ham j
or bacon for breakfast. Soup, chops.
vegetables and other components of a j
hearty lunch were eaten daily. For din- |
ner Miss Dolbeer would have such va- .
riety as soup, oysters, a bird or roast |
beef. !
Miss Wilcoxen said that Miss Dolbeer j
slept very well every night, though she
admitted that the usual light sleeping
potion given to persons taking the rest
cure was administered. She denied
positively the allegation of contestant
that the testatrix was constantly fed
with trianol to produce sleep. Accord-
Ing to the witness Miss Dolbeer was
happy In anticipation of the trip to Eu
rope and much pleased when it was
definitely arranged that she could go.
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, : FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1904.
The witness saw the envelopes con
taining the original will and copy, re
spectively. In response to a Jocular in
quiry Miss Dolbeer remarked in the
same vein, "Oh, I made my will long
ago." The day Miss Dolbeer left the
house with Mrs. Douglas Sloane Wat
son to execute her will she, was per
fectly sane and in good spirits, de
clared Miss Wilcoxen, and was in nor
mal frame. of mind when she returned.
Miss Ether Roche, a niece of the tes
tatrix and a beneficiary under the will
to the amount of $10,000, who is em
ployed as clerk for Dunham, Carrlgan
& Havden. said she met Miss Dolbeer
three times last March and regarded
her as perfectly sane.
GUEKXWOOD'S DEPARTURE.
Attorney Hiram Johnson moved to
strike out the deposition of Fred A.
Greenwood, read the day before, on the
ground that the deponent had been in
the city and available till Monday last,
when he started for the East. When his
deposition was taken several weeks ago
he made the statement under oath that
he was then about to leave 'the State,
and Johnson objected to the alleged
sharp work. Judge Coffey held, how
ever, that the deposition should stand.
Inasmuch as deponent was now beyond
the confines of California.
William G. Mugan, one of the eÂ«
ecutors named by Miss Dolbeer, was
next called. He corroborated much, of
the important evidence produced, and
then told of the efforts of Mrs. Eliza
beth C. Phillips, the principal witness
for the contestant, to Induce the pay
ment to her. of a bonus of $15,000, to be
added to her legacy of $10,000. She had
threatened to "break the will" if Miss
Warren "did not disgorge." The wit
ness related the details of the inter
view with her and his part in it, in
which he told Mrs. Phillips that she
was merely engaging In a blackmailing
scheme. The witness was being taken
over the hurdles in cross-examination
by Hiram Johnson when court ad
journed. . . *
Town Talk.
The Saunterer tells of the revivification
of Has-beens at the Martin ball, of the
discovery of Maxlne Elliott by society
and of the disappointment of- a distin
guished Britisher who made desperate
love to a local belle. He also tells of a
titled foreigner who Is here ostensibly
to avoid managing mammas at - home,
and among his many, exclusive items of
interest is the story of the marriage of
a matinee idol to a San Francisco girl.
He also tips the winner of the Speaker
ship contest, gives a_ great doal. of exclu
sive political news,' and tells â  how .the
Chinatown sack is distributed. The lit J
erary features this week are of the usual
high standard. The story by Robert
Mace .seems to have been inspired by the
Dolbeer will contest, 1 and contains a- sug
gestion of considerable value. That ex
quisite stylist, Harry Cowell, discusses
the universal vice, vulgarity.
Cannady Released on Writ.
An application for a writ of habeas
corpus for the release of W. A. Can
nady was made by Attorneys McClel
lan & McClellan before Judge Cook
yesterday and was made returnable
forthwith. Cannady was arrested on
Monday night without a warrant, but
a telegraphic' warrant was received by
the police from San Jose just before
the case came up for hearing. Can
nady was charged with publishing
false statements regarding the oecu
niary condition, of a corporation? and
his attorneys contended that no such
crime . could be .found ini the Penal
Code and that therefore no public of
fense was charged. The Judge agreed
with them and ordered the .writ grant
ed and the defendant â¢ discharged." Can
ncdy is manager and secretary of the
Fresno Diamond Company. *
Marsicano Case Arjrucd.

brief of George D. Collins in defense

SCANDAL DRAWS
TOWARD CLOSE
Though the Police Commission met
yesterday afternoon' to proceed Avith
the investigation of the charges of cor
ruption in Chinatown it found more of
interest in the petition of Martin Cre
Â«xlia that he be allowed to drape the
doorways of boxes in his restaurant
at 15 Third street with curtains than
in the police investigation- This peti
tion occasioned an animated discussion
between Chief Wittman and the mem-,
bers of the board.
Commissioner Ilutton did not see
why the petition should De denied in
view of the fact that many of the
larger cafes enjoy the privilege, but he
said he was In favor of ." having the
doorways of the booths In every res
taurant in town removed. He said
they offered opportunity for women and
even children to drink. Chief Witt
man said all he wanted â  to know was
the pleasure of the board in. reference
to the curtains and he would see any
order that might be issued would be
carried out. The question, went over
to the next meeting of the board. .
The Chinatown scandal was then
taken up, but nothing was accom
plished. Attorney Jacob S. Meyer said
that he had been unable to get the
District Attorney to (Stipulate as to the
disposition. of the contents of the safe
taken from the place of Chin Kun You
at 820 Washington street and that in
consequence the search warrant pro
ceedings must be prosecuted to a con
clusion. He said that should he re
cover possession of the safes. he would
open them in the presence of the police
and give them all of the documents
they contain.
Commissioner Drinkhouse next made
plain his position toward the gamblers
of Chinatown by reciting an incident
that occurred in January. He said he
was taking a party through Chinatown
and upon entering a brightly lighted
place found that it was a gambling
resort and that fantan was running.
He forthwith reported the matter to
Sergeant Christiansen, who told him
that he (Christiansen) had tried to en
ter the place earlier in the evening but
had been unable to do so. Drinkhouse
then reported his discovery to Chief of
Police Wittman and the Chief put a
slop to the gambling.
After Commissioner^ Drinkhouse had
concluded his story the case was con
tinued until next Tuesday night, when
any further evidence that may be dis
covered in the meantime will be con
sidered. ,

ASA R. WELLS
DIES AFTER A
LONG ILLNESS
PROMINENT CITIZEN AND FOR
MER AUDITOR OF SAN FRAN
CISCO WHO DIED YESTERDAT.
Asa. R. Wells, for half a century a
citizen of San. Francisco, prominent In
public life and successful in private en
deavor, died yesterday morning at his
home, 1406 JÂ«ckson street. Burdened
by years, he* failed in health a twelve
month ago and, though the immediate
cause of death is given by his physician
as heart failure, it was time's inroads
that had taken from his once strong
physique the power to resist disease.
He was 75 years of age when the sum
mons came. He leaves a widow and
three sons and two daughters, all of
whom live in this city.
The late Mr. Wells came to San Fran
cisco !n the early fifties from Saratoga,
N. Y. He engaged largel in ship
pine, but gave some of his time to the
lumber business. Though he met with
some financial reverses- it is said that
he amassed a fortune, which he invest
ed in San Francisco realty.. A few
years ago he retired from business life,
though every campaign found him ac
tive on behalf of his party â the .Repub
lican.
He was elected Auditor of the city,
which office he filled with credit, and in
1901 he was nominated for Mayor, but
met defeat after an. energetic { cam
paign, conditions at the time being un
favorable to his " candidacy. In that
campaign he led his Democratic com
petitor by a large majority. "
Mr. Wells was treasurer of California
Comrr.andery No. 1, Knights Templar.
