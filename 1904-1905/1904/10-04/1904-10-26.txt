ST. LOUIS, Oct. 25.â Propelled part
of the way by its own powgr and the
remainder of the distance by the wind,
which was blowing at the rate of about
rine or ten miles an hour, the airship
Arrow, owned by Thomas S. Baldwin
of San Francisco; in charge of A. R.
-Knabenshue of Toledo, made an un
announced ascension from the aeronau
tic concourse at the World's Fair to
day and landed near Cahokia, 111.; a
distance of nearly ten miles. The flight
attracted the attention of thousands of
persons, who cheered almost continu
ously as the big machine "passed over
the exposition grounds, left the resi
dence section of St. Louis far beneath
it and soared high above the towering
office buildings of the business district.
Clinging to the framework of the car,
fcis precarious foothold an iron tub<2
that forms one Fide of the base of the
triangular network of supports and
ribs of the airship. Knabenshue direct
ed the movements of the flying ma
chine and maneuvered in circles and
against the wind high over the mon
eter exhibit palaces of the exposition
before an accident to his motor ren
dered the big fan-like propellers useless
and curtailed his command of the air
ship.
STEERS AS HE PLEASES.
Notwithetandlng the breaking of the
motor, Knabenshue did not lose com
plete control of the machine, but with
the momentum given by the wind he
Â¦was enabled to steer the machine in a
course thai varied several points in
each direction from the trend of , the
wind and land at a point of his own
6election.
After he had landed, Knabenshue
Btated that when he found he could
control the movements of the airship
even after the motor was useless, he
determined to make the test a fair one
end decided to effect a landing on the
east side of the Mississippi River.
Steering hia balloon so that he could
gsda the beet speed from the wind,
Knabenshue directed its course over
the southwestern residence district of
St. Louis. Passing rapidly eastward
the Arrow reached the downtown dis
trict, where . its appearance was the
cignal for the greatest excitement.
Practically all business was suspended
While the airship passed over the city.
From its movement the spectators
could not determine whether the pro
pellers were working, as the big ship
eeemed to respond to every demand
made by its navigator and to change
lta course at will, not at the vagaries
of the wind. Although then nearly a
mile high. Knabenshue could be seen
occasionally moving back and forth on
his dangerous standing place, keeping
his ship under control and directing its
movements either upward or downward
es he desired.
From the Missouri side he passed to
the Illinois side of the Mississippi River,
and having completed his self-imposed
task headed toward Cahokia and
brought his airship to the ground about
half a mile from that little hamlet.
When within about ten feet of the
earth Knabenshue threw out his grap
ple and one of the books caught on a
large tree standing on the edge 'of a
clearing, and the machine settled slow
ly to the ground, resting lightly upon
Its fracework.
OF. A UNIQUE DESIGN*.
Knabenshue alighted and secured the
airship to prevent injury from the wind
and hurried to i>ut himself In commu
nication with Baldwin, - who had re
mained at the World's Fair grounds,
and assure him that the Arrow was un
injured. The flight occupied exactly
one hour. The motor 'broke, about fif
teen minutes after the airship lef t '. the

Hon. George P. Adams, Registrar of Voters of the City and County of
San Francisco:
Dear Sir- â We are credibly informed that there have been certain people
registered from four lodging-houses in this city who do not reside there and
who are, therefore. Improperly on the great register as qualified voters and
whose names should therefore be canceled therefrom.
There were ten men registered from a certain lodging-house at 54 Sacra
mento street of whom only two resided there.
There' were twenty-three men registered as residing at 641 Commercial
street, whereas. only ten resided there.
There were twenty-six men registered from 631 Sacramento street,
whereas only fifteen resided there.
There were seven, ty-two men registered from 634 Sacramento street,
whereas only fifty-six resided there.
The lists of men who are improperly registered because they do not re
side at these various. lodging- houses are. appended to this letter. Our in
formation comes from the keepers of these lodging-houses. "W^ would, there
fcTe, request you to cite all of those persons whose names appear in these
lists appended to this letter to appear before the Board of Election Commis
$loners l tQ'sho\\* cause >why you should, not .cancel .their, J respective names
from the great register ' in- accordance with theTusuat practice iix 'men cases.
We would also call your attention to the fact that this year there are
one hundred -and' thirty-five Chinese registered ' from the Chinatown pre
cincts and ; that -heretofore the average number of Chinese registered from
these precincts has been about twenty- five. We are credibly informed of
one instance where a Chinese twenty-nine years of age was permitted to be
registered, though he could not read the constitution in the English lan
guage without prompting and to whom the word "voted" proved an insur
mountable stumbling block. /
We also append to this letter a list of the Chinese who are registered
from the Chinatown precincts and would request that you summon them
before you and question such of them as are under thirty-one years of age
upon their ability to read the constitution in the English language and
write their names. If one Chinese be illegally registered who Is unable to
write his name or read the constitution In English, it is probable that there
have been many more illegally admitted to registration.
A duplicate of this letter has been sent to the Board of Election Com
missioners. Tours respectfully.

FATE OF THE DOWAGER EMPRESS
OF CHINA HANGS BY A HAIR
The Merchants Association of San Francisco, in its com
mendable work to promote the purity of elections by exposing
false registration, repeating and ballot-box stuffing, has placet! im
portant information in the hands of the Election Commissioners
and Registrar of Voters. The association has given to the Commis
sioners and the Registrar lists of men who are improperly regis
tered. The names of the falsely registered are noted and the places
of alleged residence are designated.
A list of Chinese registered from the Chinatown precincts is
embodied in the elaborate communication to the board. It is shown
that 135 Chinamen registered this year. Hitherto the average
number was about 25.
It is presumed that the Election Commissioners and the Reg
istrar of Voters will promptly act on the suggestion of the Mer
chants' Association and cause a thorough investigation to be
made, to the end that all false registration may be canceled at
once.

town, and there was an abundance of

E. A. Hayes delivered'a stirring ad
dress, dealing with "the tariff and the
issues raised by the national platform*.
He urged the -election of the entire
Republican ticket. This was neces
sary, he said, to insure the carrying
out of the policy advocated by " Mc-
Kinley and now being put in force
by Roosevelt. Hayes said a Republi

elected to- work for the interests of
California and the citizens of the San

SOLID DELEGATION.
; A solid Republican delegation to Con
gress now seems assured. The Demo
crats are putting up fights in the First,
Second, Fifth and Sixth districts. At
the outset the State Central Committee
'was inclined to regard the Second Dis
trict as the one exposed to the greatest
danger on account of a "subterranean"
campaign on the part , of the Demo
crats, but late advices from the several
precincts of each county of the great
district convince the Republican cam
paign managers that McKinlay will be
elected by a majority of 2000.
The most gratifying intelligence at
party headquarters comes from the
Democratic counties of Mendocino,
jTolo, Lake, Glenn and Colusa. The
Republicans are exceedingly active and
vigilant in the Democratic strongholds
and are bringing into the camp of
prosperity many voters who formerly
trained in' the Democratic ranks.
It is gossip in political camps that a
Bell expedition was recently organized
in Sacramento for a still hunt in San
Francisco for stories'to be used against
Duncan E. McKinlay at the finish of
the campaign. The still " hunters are
an the scent of an oil stock story which
has been* peddled around the San Fran
cisco newspaper offices and everywhere
rejected. "

KXOX FLAYS PARKER.
I heard Mr. Cortelyou say to the President
on' his last visit to Washington: "Mr. Presi
dent, I firmly believe you will be elected. If
>od ar*. I can say here and now that you
will' take office Without a promise of any
kind to any man having been made by any
member of the national committee."
'In view of Parker's instructions at
the opening of the campaign that there
should be no attacks of a personal
character upon the President, the lat
ter'e friends are astounded at the tone
of this speech. They look upon it as a
sharp attack on the personnel of the
present administration from Mr.
Roosevelt down, and the integrity of
his campaign managers.
A member of the cabinet whose per-
EonaJ and political relations with the
President are closer than* those of any
other member since the retirement of
Root made, answer to-day to Parker's
charges. -He is so intimate with the
President that when he talks of mat
ters of this kind it may. fairly be as
sumed that he speaks directly from Mr.
Roosevelt. In a statement to The Call
correspondent he said:
Parker's speech has certainfy lowered the

of his earlier utterance. By a curious coin

Fide by side with Parker's Esopus speech, a

within & week been largely Increased by con

which is generally supposed to be the Standard
OH Company.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON, Oct. â¢ 25. â President
Koosevelt's friends here, both in and
out of the administration, do not hesi
tate to openly express surprise at what
they call the "unworthy character of
Judge Parker's campaign against the
administration." Vigorous comment is
made on Parker's speech at Esopus
yesterday, in which he charged that
officers under the present administra
tion were appointed at the dictation of
great combinations of capital and that
trust contributions to Roosevelt's cam
paign fund were nothing less than a
direct purchase of immunity.
When Mr. Hill last April In the State con
vention which put Judge Parker forward for
the Presidential nomination declared that the
trusts should be regulated by the State and
not by the nation and when. Judge Parker
himself declared that the common law was
sufficient for their regulation, knowing full
well that this meant the abandonment of
every effort to regulate them by the Federal
Government, Mr. Hill and Judge Parker were
bidding for the support of the great corpora
tions and bidding for. this support with reck
less disregard of the interests of the public.
Now, as a last despairing effort, he inveighs
against them and seeks to obtain votes by
thus attacking them In a manner utterly un
worthy of the candidate of a great party for
the high office of President.
Judge Parker's statement In yesterday â¢
speech that the President and the trusts com
bined in an effort to "satisfy the country
that trusts were opposed to the present ad
ministration" Is simply preposterous and
smacks of the rashness of desperation.
Intimate associates and v supporter*, the men
who conducted his campaign for the nomina
tion and . who are now conducting the cam
paign for his election, represent these very
corporations which he affects to denounce, or
else owe their political strength solely to
the contributions they have received from them
in the past and expect to ! receive from them
In thn future.
Again, Judge Parker eays: "Political con
tributions by co/poratlons and' trusts mean
corruption. They cannot be honest. A cor
poration will subscribe to a political party only
because the corporation expects that party,
through its control of public officers, executive
or legislative, to do something for the benefit
of the corporation, or to refrain from doing
something to its Injury. No other motive
can be imagined; that In the nature of things
no other motive can exist."
It is astonishing that Judge Parker should
have the temerity to say this when his own
Again, Judge Parker speaks of the campaign
contributions by great corporations. He states
that some of the enterprises which have un
duly thfived through favoritism have become
eo rich and strong that they can and do con
tribute vast sums when It is made clear that
It will be advantageous to them. Judge Par
ker Is describing precisely and exactly the
6ources which gave Tammany Hall its strength
and the cutting on* of which In the pres
ent election would remove every chance of his
carrying New York State. There Is not an
honest man In political life who does not
know that this is the case and knows that
Judge Parker is seeking to be the beneficiary
ofl the very methods which he affects to de
nounce.
It is astounding that Judge Parker should
be willing to challenge the comparison which
thlÂ« statement inevitably calls out. When
Judge Parker last actively participated In pol
itics oft the bench he was chairman . of the
New York State Democratic Committee, which
elected David B. Hill as Governor. He was
a cog in the Hill machine.' There have never
been in our political history methods more
debasing and corrupt than those of the Hill
machine In New York, and they culminated
In the steal of the State by frauds and the
overthrow of the Hill machine In consequence.
This was the machine which Mr. Parker ran
until, as a reward for running It. he was
made a Judge by Hill, and these are the meth
ods he deoloree. - â¢Â»
Judge Parker. In his speech on Monday, also
*aid: "Many years have passed since my act
ive participation in politics. In the meantime
a startling change has taken place in the

WHY APPENDICITIS?
â¢
VThs Is appendicitis so common to-
day?
Because we have got into the per-
nicious habit of eating too fast.
Dr. Curtis, the great authority on
this disease, says: "Appendicitis of-
ten follows the eating of a very hasty,
or particularly large or indigestible
meaL" ,
After carelessly following a foolish
custom you can insure your safety by
taking Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
It Is an accepted, scientific truth,
which admits of no dispute, that If
you will only keep ydur digestive ap-.
paratus In good order you will never
suffer from this dread disease, which,
at best, means a weakening operation,
with long weeks wasted In bed and
big doctor's and surgeon's bills to pay
as souvenirs.
Keep your appendix in health by
the proper use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets whenever you have laid your-
self open to danger by overeating and
upon the least sign of stomach or in-
testinal trouble, for otherwise, at any
time, this dangerous disease may lay
you low.
The curative influence of this great
medicine Is quickly shown in the gen-
tle, soothing effect It has on all in-
flamed, conditions of any part of the
digestive tract.
' Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets tone all
these parts up to a proper condition
of perfect health and regulate their
functions into a proper working state.
They also make away with all, the
causes of Irritation, Inflammation or
indigestion by helping to dissolve, di-
gest and assimilate or. put to proper.
use all the food which is lying around
in odd corners of your, digestive ap-
paratus, fermenting, rotting and
curdling, like so much garbage in a
dirty sink.
In these natural and perfectly sim-
ple ways' Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
restore all sufferers from" any form of
dyspeptic trouble to health.'
They are safe and reliable. . They
never fail to" relieve and cure quickly
end permanently. Â«.
â¢ Use them and you need never .worry
about your appendix vermif or mix. j- â¢ .

The "Nervous" Condition.
The term "nervous" is a broad term used to
denote a diseased condition of the nerves that if
very common. The disease is a debility or weak-
ness that affects especially the nervous system.
There may be no well-defined trouble, yet those
who suffer with nervousness will complain of
many things, mental depression, inability to rest
well, twitching, aching limbs, and hundreds of
nervous disorders. Sleep is not refreshing and
the patient wakes up tired. Although the lungs,
heart, liver and kidneys are sound, yet thÂ«Â«
seems to be serious disease in these vital organs,
and sufferers with weak nerves feel that all that
physical powers are failing.
Nervousness is wholly the result of wear and
tear of the neivous system, caused by Irregular
habits, long-continued anxiety or worry, too great
business responsibility, and any cause which tends
to diminish the vigor of the body.
The beautiful delicacy ef the nervous system
can be appreciated when it Â« considered that* the
nerve fibres do not exceed one-fifteen-htmdredtb
of an inch in. diameter.
Each of these nerve fibres proceeds from the
nerve centre with which it is connected, to the
point at which it terminates, without uniting with
any other.
So delicate is the structure and so intimately
associated are .its parts, that the nervous system
can be deranged easily, and diseased or weakened..
-Often sufferers from nervousness do rfgV
realize that their nerves need nourishing
â¢rid strengthening. They wait and hope
until the condition Is of long standing be-
fore acting. Here .Is a case In point.
Brooklyn, N. Y., Aug. 2, 1904^--lt affords
me pleasure to voice my appreciation of
Paine's Celery Compound, as I think It a,
truly wonderful remedy. It cured" me of
nervousness and stomach trouble of long
standing when alt other remedies failed.*.
âGeo. W. Davren, 6401 Fifth Ave.
Victims of nervousnessâ those whose very'Ufe
hangs heavy on their hands, depressed by their
-existence, -or borne down by stress of overwork;
Paine's Celery Compound stands ready to build
Â» the nerves back to their healthy 'condition â to put
an end to sleeplessness, and to drive away every
ache and pain.
Two days' treatment with Paine's Celery Com-*
pound will give proof of its marvelops powers.
For 17 years this famous prescription has been
the most universally, used tonic in the world. It
has stood the test of time. Physicians constantly
use and prescribe it. No prescription has ever
been formulated that equaled it in curative power.
Remember this,â Paine's Celery Compound is
the prescription of one of the most famous physi-
cians this country ha/ ever known, and all repu-
table Druggists sell and recommend it.Â»*

to the effect that the Russian Govern

large number of Japanese had gone
aboard fishing trawlers at Hull and
that a torpedo attack would be made
upon tne Baltic fleet during its passage
of the North Sea. The information was
regarded as somewhat hazy, but never

warned to, keep a sharp lookout and to
take no chances.. In view of subsequent

LONDON. Oct. 25.â The inevitable de
lays of diplomatic procedure appear to
retard a complete and satisfactory set
tlement of the acute differences between
Great Britain and Russia arising from
the deplorable North Sea affair. King
Edward has received from Emperor
Nicholas himself a cablegram express
ing the deepest regret and a practical
acknowledgment that Great Britain's
peremptory note will meet with a reply
conceding every demand for apology
for the act of aggression against Â¦ the
British flag, compensation for the suf
ferers and punishment of ! the ; officers
responsible for what is everywhere con
ceded to have been a gigantic blunder,
and the Russian Embassador to the
court of St. James has . expressed to
Foreign Minister Lansdowne his sorrow
and sympathy. These developments,
which came late in the day, j have al
layed to some extent the deep resent
ment in the public mind, and the. Ad
miralty to-night gave evidence of its,
appreciation of the necessity of proving
that it is prepared actively to support
the position of the people of Great Brit
ain and fulfill the expectations of the
world when.it Issued the following
statement:

SEATTLE, Oct. 25.â Between thirty
and thirty-five persons were injured,
two perhaps fatally, in. a head-on col
lision between cars on the Seattle and
Renton Electric Railroad about 1000
feet south of the Hill brickyard in the
lower part of the city to-day. The ac
cident was due in part to the dense fog,
but, mainly because one of the cars
moved from its switch before the
motorman was certain that the proper
signal was given. Twenty minutes be
fore the accident on the Renton line
two of the large university cars on the
Seattle Electric Company's line ran to
gether at Marvin street, near the
bridge over Lake Union. Both motor
men were badly Injured and three pas
sengers were hurt.

THOMAS CARR, Admiral..
The report of Thomas Carr, the
"admiral" of the fishing fleet, dated
from the "North Sea" is a picturesque
touch, a plain sailor's yarn of the oc
currence, which was handed to For
eign Minister Lansdowne to-night. The
report Is dated "The North Sea, Octo
ber 22," and is as follows:
We were fishing in latitude 55.19 north and
longitude 5 east, the night of October 21. At
11:30 p. m. a large fleet of men of war
sprung up on our lee bow, the "wind belntr
about south-southeast. One squadron passed
by our lee side. '.The remainder, consisting of
four. battleships. HtÂ«-araed just across our head
throwing searchlights over our fleet. As soon
4s. they got to windward they began firing on
us. their projectiles Hying all around and across
our decks for a full quarer of an hour, some
of the shots passing under the mainsails so
unpleasantly near the men who were getting
fish In the pound that they cleared out down
below, one shot "passing right between them.
I very much regret to say that others In.
the fleet-: were not so fortunate as us In escap
ing hurt. The Crane was sunk, her skipper
and third hand were killed and all' the rest
of the crew were wounded, with -the exception
of the cook. The, skipper of the Gull . it was
who, being hailed by the Crane, saying: "We
are .' sinking," hove up his gear, got. out a
boat and went to the rescue of the unfortunate
survivors. 1 1 "" s â¢ .Â¦ -.,Â¦-.â¢Â¦ *
The post-mortem examination of the

IN DENSE FOG
LONDON. Oct. 26. â A new Russian
loan of 5270,000,000. according to the
Brussels correspondent of, the Stand
ard, has virtually been concluded.
Russia Negotiates New Loan.
The Standard's Moscow correspond
ent also asserts that "the majority of
the Russian people find more or less
satisfaction in the insult offered to
England."
PURCHASE OF WARSHIPS.
That a possibility of dangerous de
velopments lurks in the protraction of
the crisis is seen in the fact that Rus
sian correspondents of British papers
are beginning to send rather inflamma
ble dispatches. For example, the Tele
praph's St. Petersburg correspondent
this? morning says:
"In military circles among the less
responsible officers and In marine cir
cles of almost all grades the conviction
prevails that sooner or later war with
England Is inevitable, and that the
present moment is as auspicious as any
other."
LONDON, Oct. 26. â The Russo-Japa
nese war is almost forgotten and the
papers are occupied almost exclusively
with the North Sea affair. So far the
attitude of the Government meets with
the approval of the public, who are
greatly gratified with the instructions
of the Admiralty for co-operation be
tween the Mediterranean, channel and
home squadrons should necessity arise.
The home fleet, consisting of nine bat
tleships and three cruisers, which has
been stationed at Cromarty, left Tues
day night for the south to be in readi
ness for any necessary concentration.
All leaves have been stopped in the
navy, and in the unlikely event of the
situation becoming so serious as to need
it a very strong naval force could
quickly be concentrated.
Russians Believe a Clash With Great
Britain Is Inevitable.
DRIFTING TOWARD WAR.
TOKIO, Oct. 25, 7 p. m. â Field Mar
shal Oyama reports that the Japanese
total casualties were 15,879 officers
and men at the battle of Shakhe River.
Oyama's Statement of Losses.
CHEFU, Oct 25. â A junk which
arrived here to-day from Antung on
the Yalu River reports that eight Jap
anese warehouses containing rations,
clothing, ammunition and the prizes
wen at the battle of the Yalu were
burned recently, the fire lasting two
days. Incendiarism is suspected. Two
Japanese officers; who were respon
sible for the care of the building, com
mitted suicide.
Japanese Army Stores Burned.
At the same time this consideration
has an ominous ring about it, only
serving to emphasize the gravity of
the situation, the language of the
note admitting of no doubt that
when the demands are ultimately pre
sented Great . Britain intends to in
sist upon full compliance with, them.
From . the diplomatic standpoint the
very fact that Great Britain h_*s not
shown' her hand strengthens her po
sition. What the nature of the de
mands.;wiU.;be,,rnusJ:, necessarily, be. a
matter, of speculation-. until Admiral
Rojestvensky's report arrives, but if
the important allegation in the note is
established, namely, that the squadron
actually > charrged formation before
opening 'fire, it would Beem to fix the
responsibility upon Rojestvensky; and,
whoever the author of the offense may
be it is regarded as certain that Great
Britain will demand, among other
things, his punishment. It is also con
sidered certain that failure to prompt
ly comply would be followed by Em
bassador Hardinge's recall.
Although some . nervousness is per
ceptible in diplomatic circles, gener
ally shaking there is the greatest con
fidence both among diplomats and
high officials of the, Government that
the affair will be amicably adjusted.
It is felt, indeed, that the great gravity
of the' situation may prove its salva
tion by imposing the utmost care and
deliberation upon both sides.
: It is known that the Emperor was
greatly grieved and shocked when he
heard the news at Kronstadt on Mon
day afternoon. To a member- of the
court, the press learns; he , has al
ready expressed a determination to
punish whoever^ is responsible for the
error. x '.-A
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 26, 2:50 a.
m.â Vice Admiral Rojestvensky's rea
sons for firing upon the British fishing
fleet remain as great a mystery as
ever, jj Again at midnight the Admiral
ty announced that the admiral's report
of the affair had not been received.
Meantime, without waiting the Rus
sian version of the affair, Emperor
Nicholas, through Embassador Har
dinge, has sent to King Edward and
the British Government a message con
veying an expression of the profounde3t
regret for the . unfortunate affair,
coupled with assurances that the fam
ilies of the victims should receive the
fullest reparation.
The British Government also shows
moderation in the note which Embas
sador i Hardlnge presented to Count
Lamsdorft this afternoon. While it
awaits an explanation for an act which
it characterizes in strong language as
unjustifiable, deliberate and inhuman,
it makes no threats, fixes no time limit
for response and contains no demands,
the note specifically stating that Great
Britain's .demands are reserved pend
ing receipt of an explanation.
The willingness of Great Britain to
await the. Russian explanation before
formulating demands shows considera
tion for the position . in which Russia
has been placed by a deplorable blun
der. ,

HARBIN, Oct. 25. â Viceroy Alex
ieff on Monday published an Im
perial decree -appointing General Ku
ropatkin commander in chief of all
the land forces in the East and retain
ing Alexieff in the post of Viceroy.
"The Emperor also congratulated Vice
roy Alexieff on the efficiency he had
displayed in the formation, concentra
tion and supreme direction of troops
in the theater of operations.
Alexieff, in his proclamation, thanks
the land and sea forces for the self
sacrifice they have shown and says he
is proud of the mark of confidence be-
Etowed upon him by the Emperor In
intrusting him with the supreme com
mand of gallant troops. He says, in
conclusion, that with God's help their

Admiral Lambton declared that he
could never* believe any naval officer,
Russian or otherwise, would do a das
tardly act intentionally. Naval officers
sometimes made mistakes, but said Ad
miral Lambton, "give them time to
apologize and everything will be all
right."
Admiral Lambton's statement, com
bined with Lord Selborne's expressions,
are taken as practically closing the
North Sea affair. .Admiral Lambton
saw King Edward to-day, and undoubt
edly he voiced the highest views.
Admiral Jewell did not refer to the
Anglo-Russian difficulty, but in the
briefest of speeches won applause by
reference to the lack of all jealousy be

ter ended September 30 last shows net
earnings, after the usual reductions for

the same period they were $94433,970
and in 1302. $101,825,004.

TAFT ANSWERS PARKER.
Secretary of War Says Democratic
â¢ Candidate Has Been Misled.
NEWARK, N. J., Oct. 25.âSecretary
ot "War Taft addressed a Republican
meeting here to-night which filled the
Kruger Auditorium to the doors. Sec
retary Taft spoke on the cosfof the
Philippines, and in answer to a recent
'speech of Judge Parker, of which, the
Secretary said, the statements therein
contained are so wide of the truth and
Â¦the sensational character of his ut
terances Is so unwarranted by any of
the conditions In the Philippines that
one must conclude that he has been
greatly misled.
BOSTON. Oct. 25.â The triennial, gen
eral convention of the Episcopal church,
which has been in session here since
October 6, was ended to-day with a
public service in Trinity Church.
Prom .the pulpit Â¦ Bishop PotUr of
New York read' a pastoral letter, ad
dressed to - the , church at large. ; The
communication, .which 1 - consisted of
more ; than 8000 words, considered 'the
problems now before the country. Re
garding divorce the letter said that the
facility with which the marriage rela
tion may be taken on and put off is one
of the menaces of American civilization,
to the possible perils of which Chris
.tlan people are as yet very imperfectly
aroused. The letter made a plea for the
permanence and security of the family,
it also discussed the negro problem,
stating that the church waa taking
steps to correct the situation so far as
possible. Other pressing questions were
dealt with. V-i-c . . _.
'I'Hn; FAMTf/Y TBRTCATKN n:Â».
The letter paid aÂ«hlgh tribute to tho
Archblshou of Canterbury, saying that
his visit has cemented the two great
peoples. After -pointing out the ne
cessity of supporting missions in Jap
an. China and other Oriental districts,
the letter continued : .
Mt is a question which we In this republic
may wisely consider, whether with greater
freedom we I have always won a great purity
of righteousness. At the basis of our social
order is the family; ' and while we are fond of
drdinx at our Oriental .brethren for their po
ly gamic Â¦ constitution of -that Institution, It Is
worth . while Â¦ to ask ourselves the - question
whether the laws of this land are not In dan
ger of bringing In, though by quite another
road, a worse evil.
The letter takes up what it terms
"those two great problems which to
day supremely: confront the republic
âthe labor question and the race Is
sue." ' Of. the first the pastoral de
clares that "whatever labor organiza
tions have accomplished they have
mainly moved along lines which are
the glory of our . democratic institu
tions."
MUST FACE RACE ISSUE.
Touching the race problem, the let
ter, after referring* to the appointment
of a Joint commission to investigate
the question, says:
If by giving them (the negroes) freedom,
we have only riven them the power to work
mischief: and If lynchmg has come to be de
fended as a necessary protection to families,
then surely we are face to face with a situa
tion at once desperate and dishonoring. We
may not ignore it; we cannot disown Itrlt Is
a part of our social ' system and If the church
can have nothing to say about it, then she
simply disowns her God and her master..
The letter closes with a warm in
dorsement of the International Peace
Congress, saying::
The creation of The Hague tribunal and the
recognition If not the formal adoption of in
ternational courts . of arbitration .by some of
the foremost empires of- Europe has Indicated
the recognition of an altered sentiment In ra
zard to the arbitrament of war, of most pro
found Birnlflcance.
Little business of Importance was
transacted at the final business session.
A resolution permitting foreign congre
gations to use forms of service in their
own tongue was adopted after a sharp
contest. This legislation was enacted
specifically for the benefit of Swedish
congregations in Minnesota.
. The next convention will be held In
Richmond, Va., in 1907. .

BERKELEY, Oct. 25.â A farmers' In
stitute with a distinct university flavor
and a Greek 'sacrificial proÂ«esslon to
round out the affair constituted an at
traction that drew E000 persons to the
Greek Theater on the university cam
pus this afternoon. The novelty of the
event was described fitly In a phrase by
President Wheeler when he spoke of it
as a "never-has-been."
The srlee club and university band,
rooters by hundreds and co-eds innu
merable, all panoplied in the distinctive
garb of university students, assisted in
welcoming the farmers who had trav
eled from interior points to attend this
notable institute. If ever there was a
chasm, real or Imaginary, between
academic folk and the agricultural pop
ulation, it was bridged over at the uni
versity to-day, when welcome of the
royal 6ort was extended to guests by
each of these sections of university
humanity and acknowledged by cheers
and handclapping from the guests to
express their pleasure In the reception
accorded them. A master mind ap
parently had planned that the pro
gramme should reflect the appreciation
which university men have for those
great agricultural interests that make
bo large a part of California's riches.
AS DID TIIE GREEKS OF OLD.
Notably interesting was the Greek
sacrificial procession, being a reproduc
tion in the life of the famous Parthe
non frieze. This came as the last
feature of the programme, and was
eagerly awaited, none leaving the place
until the procession had twice made its
way across the long stage of the Greek
theater.
1 A score or more students, members
mostly of the Greek department of- the
university, participated In this T>roces
elon. Their costumes were those worn
in the recent production of "AJax."
Garbed as Greeks of old, wearing gar
lands of flowers, carrying vessels as did
those who walked In Greece when such
processions were formed, bearing fruits
and grains to offer' on the altar, the
picturesque line made Its way across
the stage. ' The spectacle was suffi
ciently impressive to still the noise in
evitable in so great an assembly out of
doors, with a half-thousand children
included in its makeup. '
Governor Pardee, who was to have
been a speaker, was not able to be
present. A telegram expressing his re
gret was read by Professor B. J. Wick
son.
While the audience waited for the
formal programme to begin, 200 root
ers, supported by the university band,
entertained the throng with the famous
"Osky-wow-worr" yell and with college
songs galore, inserting in each a senti
ment appropriate to the occasion.
There were yells for H. C. Raap,
master of the. Calif ornia State Grange,,
cheers for the Farmers' Institute, for'
the farmers, for all the < industries of
the State, with the usual volleys . for
the university and its characters. ..
The glee club was recalled until its
members were weary. Their famous
medley, concluding with the "Osky
wow-wow," the "rooters Joining in,
evoked a storm of applause.
WELCOMES THE FARMERS.
President Wheeler congratulated the
farmers, upon the university, which, he
said, was their own, referring -,to the
wisdom and foresight - of their fore
fathers who had laid its foundation. He
said in part: x
This institution, founded on the selvage of
the West, ranks among the first five uni
versities of the country. Its greatness is in
keeping with that of the State, and when thÂ«
6tatÂ« develops 'its riches and acquires the
power which such a wise observer as X.yman
Abbott says it will eventually have in meas
ure exoeedlnr that of three such States as
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
there will be nonÂ« to regret that the uni
versity was laid out on broad lines and gen
erously supported. .;_.--Â¦
The agricultural department of the university
has doubled Its service to the State each year.
This department Is well included in a unl.
verslty. for Us serrtoe Is allied to that of
other deparments â engineering-, mining and
the likeâ whose aim is the bettering of the
State and 1U life. The registration of this
department regularly increases. It is v three
times aÂ« rreat this year as it was five years

The history of the title of "Colonel"
Frank Lynch, proprietor of Satro Park,
at Frultvale, and of the feud between
him and B. Q. Blackman, C. Hardwlck,
Eugene Dean, C. Stlckney and Ed Car
roll, who he has had . arrested " for" dis
turbing his â¢ peace, was gone : Into this
afternoon at the trial of Blackman, the
first of- the defendants ' to stand trial,
: before Justice of the Peace Qulnn. ; .
Blackman testified that: Lynch's- rep
utation for honesty and veracity was
bad and that he would not believe him
under oath. -He. was* corroborated In
this by his four codefendanta. Lynch,
with his wife, testified that the defend
ants" had ' called him " vile names and
paraded about his house with shotguns.
"How did you come to have the title
of colonel?" asked Attorney Rlnehart.
"By the courtesy of the Governor of
Kentucky," replied Lynch. â
"I would like to say to this court that
this same colonel took my client to the
lonesomeness of his -own wilderness at
Fruitvale and with -only his own shad
ow as a witness threatened to kill him,"
said Rinehart. *
"Well, it's up to you to show that he
did," replied the court.
The testimony drew 'forth the. fact
that Lynch was trying to get; a permit
from the Board '. of Supervisors to r sell
liquor at his park, and that he was be
ing opposed by the men whom he has
had arrested. He also conducts a week
ly paper and has taken occasion to say
some unpleasant things about- the men
;who are now fighting him.
j Blackman admitted that on one occa
sion a fight nearly occurred, and that
it was only prevented by Lynch's re
fusal to come off his own land to fight,
while he, Blackman, had dared him to
come out into the street.
-The trial ( of Blackman was finished
this afternoon, but Justice Qulnn staged
that he would reserve his decision until
all of the men had been tried, as -the
testimony was about the same In each
case. .- , : .^

NEW YORK, Oct. 25. â John C.
Haddock, an independent coal mine
owner and operator, testifying to-day
before the Interstate Commerce Com
mission) in the case of William R.
Hearst against the coal carrying rail
roads, said that as a result of tariff
discrimination his company suffered a
loss of more than $800,000 in less than
eight years. This loss meant the dif
ference between solvency and In
solvency, and his company, which at
one time had a reputation of high
standing, which he Jealously guarded,
as a result of the alleged discrimina
tion is now in the hands of trustees.
Haddock said that he, had persis
tently complained to the management
of the Lackawanna Company and had
been met by the proposition that he
turn his properties over to the rail
road. This he had declined to do. , In
the end there was a compromise, by
which he received $150,000 from the
Lackawanna Company in settlement of
his claim for $800,000J Haddock also
said that the Lackawanna Company
would not supply a sufficient number
of. cars 'to handle the output of his
mines during the anthracite coal
strike. ,. ,
When Haddock had completed his
testimony, counsel announced that the
complainant would rest his case.
It is expected that the case will be
appealed to the United States District
Court by the Portland attorney for
the Chinaman, who is indignant at
the ruling.

The Standard OH Company depart* from its
usual custom in making; this denial for the
reason that the statements being made at 'this
time by newspapers, magazines and sensa
tional public speakers appear t* be unusually
mendacious and may, to some extent, mislead
tho public
In view of the many false and misleading
statements from various sources, the directors
of the Standard Oil Company deem It advis
able to state to the company's shareholders
and the public that neither now nor at any
time has the Standard OH Company or any
of Us constituent companies been Interested
In any business not directly related with and
necessary to the petroleum trade. It would be
almost impossible to designate in this denial
the different classes of business with which ir
responsible parties have coupled the Standard
Oil Company"s name, but it may not be amiss
to specify copper, f>teel, banks, railroads and
gas (other than natural gas) as being most
prominently mentioned. With none <of these
aftalrs has the Standard Oil Company been at
any time connected. Individual members of
the Standard Oil Company have been and are
Interested as Individuals In various enterprises
but this is entirely outside of the business of
the Standard Oil Company, which is oil alone,
unaffected by other Interests In which its
stockholders may invest. Â¦
Neither Is it true that the Standard Oil
Company, John I>. Rockefeller or any officer
of the Standard Oil Company has taken part
In securing the nomination of any of the can
didates for office, as is so positively stated.
Furthermore, it Is entirely untrue that there
is any "Standard Oil party" banded together
for speculation In stocks, as Is so generally
charged. The name of tho Standard OH Com
pany is frequently used by designing persons
In the manipulation of the stock market, but
Its use Is unwarranted.
NEW YORK, Oct. 25.â C. T. Dodd,
of counsel for the Standard Oil Com
pany, authorized to-day the following
statement:

of San Diego, a member of Company B
of the Seventh Infantry, National
Guard of California, who has been dis
missed from the Journeymen Plumb
ers' Union because he would not give
up his commission in the National
Guard. General Lauck said he regret
ted the circumstance, but thought it
was purely a local matter and should
be fought out in San Diego- without in
terference from his office. He said he
did not believe that any thinking
American laborer would, oppose any
member of his organization because of
his connection with the National Guard,
which is for the protection of the union
men as well as any other citizen.

personal supervision of Captain Bald
win ot California, and differs in many
features from shir's constructed in the
part. The eas balloon is cigar-shaped,
of Japanese silk, fifty-four feet In
length and seventeen feet in diameter,
and requires SCoO cubic feet of gas to |
innate it. The frame attachment is
thirty feet in length. It carries a double
cylinder seven horsepower gasoline en- j
grine making 2000 revolutions a minute ]
to drive the propellers. One of the chief ;
features of the machine is an arrange
ment whereby the ship is pulled
through the air instead of being pushed.
To-day's fiight was not a trial for the
World's I'air 5100.000 prize.
Thomas S. Baldwin, owner of the air
ship, said to-night that Knabenshue
had made the trial ascent to-day in
stead of himself because of the former's
light weight. '*â '-
"But I will go up myself in a few
days," added Baldwin, "and I'll show
,3'ou something startling in aerial navi
gation and maneuvering."
The Arrow. Baldwin says. Is the light
est aerial craft yet designed, the com
bined weight being between SOO and 400
pounds. He states that the accident to
the motor was caused by the chain
â¢which operates the two propellers slip
ping from the wheel, caused by the
speed of the motor.
OAKLAND, Oct. 25.â The Baldwin
airship was invented by Captain T. S.
Baldwin, who aided Dr. Greth in the
construction of the ship in which the
latter made a successful flight in San !
Francisco. The airship was built by j
Captain Baldwin in this city and was
first tested at Idora Park on August 2 j
of this year. A company known as the j
\merican Airship Company financed j
Siie construction of Baldwin's machine. !
and after the ship was completed the
inventor made several experimental as- \
censions. all of which were successful. !
Underneath the balloon, suspended by
a network of cords, is the frame which
holds the engine, propeller and rudder
und upon which the operator stands.
This frame is fifty-two feet in length
and weighs sixty pounds. It is made
of aluminum, and by a system of piano
wire guys and very light braces it is
made perfectly rigid. Just forward of
the amidship section of the frame is the
engine, which is of the regular double
cylinder gasoline type. The engine is
geared to the propeller by a chain and
sprocket gear. When the engine is run
ning at full speed the propeller makes
ISO revolutions a minute.
In one particular the Baldwin airship
differs from any heretofore invented.
This is in the location of the rudder
and propeller. The latter instead of be
ins at the stern of the ship is placed
at the bow. and the ship is pulled in
stead of being pushed through the air.
The rudder is placed at the stern, and
the inventor claims that the air forced
back from the propeller strikes the
rudder, when it is deflected and is of
preat assistance in maneuvering. The
f=hip may be raised or lowered while in
the air by elevating or depressing the
bow. This Is done by means of a slid
ing weight, Â¦which at the will of the
operator can be moved toward the bow
or the stern, thus raising or lowering
the bow, and when this is done the
propeller forces the ship up or brings
it down.
Baldwin made his first successful
fiight from Idora Park at 6 o'clock on
the morning of August 2. He sailed in
several directions, running both with
and against the wind, and after re
maining up thirty minutes made a safe
landing at the starting point. After
this he made several successful trips,
thoroughly demonstrating that his ship
was under complete control.

To the blue and gold followers the
news is inspiring. Berkeley feared that
it would lose the .valuable services of
its captain, who Â¦ is in the first rank of
college football players. Should he be
barred from . play . on . November 12 his
absence would perceptibly weaken' the
team and handicap Berkeley. At least
the Berkeleyans felt that way. There
is joy on the campus over Dr. Thomas'
announcement. , '
: Names of eligibles to Berkeley's
team, as accepted by Stanford's com
mittee, follow:
BERKELEY, Oct. 25. â Benjamin
Stroud. captain of the University of
California football eleven, who is un
der special treatment at the East Bay
Sanitarium In Oakland for an abscess
in the ear, will play with the team in
the big game. Such was the assertion
made to-day by Dr. Hay ward G.
Thomas, who is caring for the giant
center rush.
In explanation of Stroud's condition
Dr. Thomas said:
I ordered Stroud to quit practice for a
week at least that I might give his ear proper
attention. The trouble was caused by an
injury that brought on a considerable inflam
mation. There was no use in taking a chance.
The operation has been entirely successful. I
shall not permit Stroud to return to the field
until next week. By that time all danger
from a recurrence of the trouble will have
passed. . â¢ t

SEATTLE, Oct. 25. â Tommy Leahy
certainly had the laugh on his former
team mates this afternoon. He came
up In the fifth Inning with a grin on
his face and Jimmy Whalen tossed
three easy ones to him. Tommy
missed two and rolled the third to the
pitcher, who tossed It to first, giving
Leahy the ha-ha. In the seventh San
Francisco was one run ahead. Leahy
again came up, but this time the
bases were full. Tommy cracked the
ball over second, bringing in two runs
and winning the game. The old play
ers on the Seattle team presented
Parke Wilson, their former manager.

WORTH SELECTIONS.
CHICAGO, Oct. 25. â Eastern horses
played an important part in to-day's
card at Worth, taking the feature
events and being heavily backed in
both instances. The third race fur
nished one of the most sensational fin
ishes of the meeting. The entire field
of eight horses was less than two and
a half lengths apart at the wire. C. T.
Henshall, who made a killing on Pel
ham in the second race, came right
back with Sir Brillar in the third, and
after backing the two-year-old from 4
to 1 down to 3\i to 1 won the verdict by
the shortest of necks from Rusk, which
beat Mayor Johnson a head. Â£
Spencerian won the fourth event eas
ily by two lengths from Branca*. The
filly was disqualified and was placed
last for fouling: Brancas. She bore in
on the Gerst colt in the last hundred
yards and' cut him off so badly it was
impossible for him to get through.

Canteen, with Jack Martin up, was a
4 to 5 favorite. Little Em took the lead
from Dick Bernard as they raced along
the back stretch. Canteen seemed to be
in trouble, and on the far turn Martin
was using his whip on her. She could
not overhaul Little Em, and, in fact,
stopped so badly in the last furlong
that both Lord Badge and Irish Witch
beat her out. The time was good,
1:46 3-5 for one -and a sixteenth miles.

JAMAICA, N. Y.. Oct. 25.â Notable
Incidents of to-day's racing were the
victory of The Huguenot at 40 to 1 and
the defeat of the 4 to 5 favorite Can
teen In the Amagansett stake. The
Huguenot was not backed by James
Rowe, his owner, because through an
error the gelding was entered in the
fifth race instead of in the second. The
conditions of the last named were for
non-winners in 1904 which have started
since August 1. The Huguenot was
started in a six-furlong race a few days
ago, showed some speed, but found the
company too hot. It was the race won
by Ascension. That race qualified The
Huguenot to start in the second event,
but the entry clerk put the gelding In
the race in which some well-tried
horses were entered. That is whv he
drifted to 40 to 1, with no takers except
for a small amount to run third.

The revenge of the Tigers had been j
delayed for a long time, but it landed
yesterday at Idora Park, and with quite
a thud. The Commuters were on their
own battle ground and thought they
could start the week by walloping the
pride of Tacoma town. Far from it. Mr.
Buchanan got his .with regularity when
the Tigers tasted blood, and the
slaughter ended 9 to 4.
When x Buchanan got hit the fielders
behind him became erratic, and the
making of runs was a simple task for
the leaders. They started with an ace
in round one. They swelled the total
to four in the fourth spasm, and pro
ceeded to break up the ' game in a
heartless manner during the progress
of the seventh spasm, when Mr. !
Buchanan was made the victim of a
! batting conspiracy and five runs were
enticed over the pan.
J| In only one round did the Commuters
show any fight. Then it came too late.
After two had been sent to the bench
in the eighth and with a couple of men
on the sacks, Mr. Keefe's curves began
to look good to Peter's tribe. A few
well-placed bingles placed four runs to
the good and started the hearts of Oak
land's fair rooters a-throbbing. Four
runs count but little when the opposing
team has nine.
Buchanan was hit hard In every in
ning, and it was only great fielding that
kept half a dozen runs away from the
pan in the first. A remarkable play by
Devereaux and Francks helped some,
while a fine throw of a bunt to second
base by Jimmy Byrnes cut off; at least
one run. Dunleavy did the circus stunt
in the fifth, when he ran back and got
one from the bat of Nordyke that was
labeled three bags.
Next week there will be nothing but
baseball in Oakland. Seattle will mix it
with the Commuters all week, com
mencing "Wednesday. San Francisco
and Tacoma are billed to perform in
this city. It was originally intended to
hold the Oakland-Seattle series at
Fresno, but the management thought
better of the bay town. The score:

JAMAICA SELECTIONS.
Young Corbett is due to-day or to
morrow from Denver. He will proba
bly have a lot to say about Britt and
others. Out at the ringside on the
night of the battle the familiar rotund
fig-ure of Corbett is sure to be seen
climbing through the ropes a few
minutes before the principals enter
the ring.
Battling Nelson and Manager Mur
phy will arrive from Chicago to-night
at 5 o'clock on the Santa Fe.
Joe Gans spent a busy day at his
training: quarters at Billy Shannon's
villa. He was up early and took his
usual spin of fourteen miles.
After a brisk rub down Joe
stretched himself and said to his
trainers: "I feel just like a king. I
feel as though I could defeat any
man in the world."
The champion certainly seems in
fine condition and goes about his work
with a will. â¢
. In the afternoon he spent more than
an hour in the gymnasium going
through all his stunts. He skipped
the rope for a thousand times, pound
ed the bag, wrestled and pulled the
weights.
The day's work was concluded with
a nine-round bout with Kid Sullivan.
The mill, while it lasted, was interest
ing, but toward the last the Kid near
ly collapsed. Joe showed his fine con
dition, as he did not show a sign of
fatigue.
Gans seems to be satisfied with the
referee. He said, "What's the use of
kicking? The club picked him."
He still weighs in the neighborhood
of 135 pounds, but gays he can make
the required weight at will.
The advance sale of seats for the
fight opened yesterday morning at
Harry Corbett's. It proved larger
than the Britt-Corbett sale by a few
hundred dollars. The promoters of
the contest are well satisfied with the
prospect and figure on a much larger
house than any before which Britt
has fought.
ning to four miles. After to-day he
will not don the gloves again. Boxing
will #be eliminated from the pro
gramme for fear the fighter might in
jure his hands. Rope jumping, wrist
machine turning, bag punching:,
wrestling and tossing the medicine
ball will continue to be Jimmy's work
while in the gymnasium until the time
arrives to cease training and rest for
the big battle.
Jimmy boxed four rounds with Ra
fael and mixed with the punching bag
and medicine ball for half an hour. In
the morning his exercise consisted of a
run of eight miles on the road with
â¢Tiv" Kreling and a pulling and push
ing bout with Frank Rafael. Britt is
practically at weight./ Beginning to
day he will cut down his road run-
As Gans is, apparently, making the
required weight without difficulty it
is ( the general opinion among: sporting
men that he should be about a 6 to 10
choice. The next forty-eight hours will
give the betting a chance to settle down
to Fuch a degree that the odds should
be firmly fixed.
Jack Johnson, the colored heavy
Â¦w eight champion, is not drawing the
color line in his betting operations on
the fight. He saw Britt work out and
took euch a fancy to his style that he
decided to have a little bet on him. He
thinks Britt can penetrate Gans' won
derful guard, and once inside that de
fense his body blows are expected to
take all the fight out of the man from
Baltimore.
Among the visitors at Jimmy Britt's
training quarters at Croll's Gardens in
Alameda yesterday was a colored
woman, whose identity was unknown
to any one present, but whom Britt's
eparring mate, Frank Rafael, believes
was from the Gans camp. Jimmy has
never drawn the color line with re
spect to those who call to see him eo
through his gymnasium work, and the
woman of dusky hue was shown every
courtesy. Among the others who wit
nessed Britt work out yesterday were
Colonel Martin Brady and a delegation
of sports from this city, including
James Britt Sr. and Harry Corbett.
Betting has commenced in a desul
tory way on the I3ritt-Gans fight,
which takes place in Mechanics' Pa
vilion nt-xt Monday nijrht. Some bets
were made at even money yesterday,
but this price may not last long. The
money of the public talks louder than
any auctioneer of pools, and it will not
be long before the market settles down.
Eritt has a large following of men
who waprer small amounts. These have
always had a b*t down on the Callfor
nian. As ht has done everything that
has betn asked of him up to the pres
ent time they will still call for paste
boards bearing the magic name of
Britt.

five days from Umpqua, with 200.000 feet of
lumber aboard. She arrived off the Potato
Patch, or four- fathom buoy early la the
morning and the wind dying to a dead calm
was helpless. There were no towboats in
sight and the slight drift of the vessel was
rhorewtrd. The two crab fishers, Nicholas
Moreno and Antone Martini, clows by. were
hauling up their nets for the run bom* and
Ekipper Bottger. taking a good look at Lime
Point, to make cure It had not moved away,
called the â¢crab launches alongside. A bargain
was soon struck and the fishers hooked on
tandem and the procession was sooa tinder
way.
A big schooner with 200,000 feet of green
lumber Is heavier than a sight's catch of
crabs, but Antone and Nicholas at their en
gine l?vers helped the little boats over the
â¢bteep" places and the two launches, cough
ins and spitting loudly through the dim foe
iu:ck!y got the W.y't nose turned toward the
bay. The crab fishing engineers did not

The naval tag TJnadilla, which went ashore
ea Angel Island Monday forenoon In a dense
tog. was polled from her cradle of sand at
high tide about 1 o'clock yesterday morning.
The big army transport tug Slocum went up
to thÂ« stranded vessel about midnight and
when her 1000-horsepower engines got a strain
on the towllnes the Unadllla reluctantly slipped
off the saad frumfr Thus the army once more
got the navy Into deep water. The tug went
ashore In & favorable spot, and not leaking
shÂ« probably has not sustained any injury.
But soundings around the stranded hull re
vealed the fact that a few feet to the right
or left of the sandy cradle in which she
lay were rocks en which the Unadllla would
have smashed In her plates like egg shells.
Xaval Tus Unadllla Unharmed.
The Pacific Mall freighter Algoa will com
plete her loading and will sail for China and
Japan to-morrow. Captain A. ZeÂ«der will be
In command as Captain Kinder has resigned
from the company's service.
The only overdue vessel on the reinsurance
list Is the German ship Sirene, 14S days out
from Liverpool for Valparaiso. 65 per cent.
ThÂ« steamer Breakwater will sail for Coos

Midshipman Verdugo of the Chilean train
ing cruiser General Baquedano has deserted
his ship and colors. The vessel was due to
call yesterday, but the absence without leave
of the cadet delayed the Â° departure. His
brother officers say that the young- man Is
in poor health and Is for other reasons dls
eatisfled with the naval service, and they think
be has found friends- who are hiding him
away till the ship sails. Whatever the causa
of his desertion his shipmates deplore the
senselee act. which ruin his future and dis
grace* his name. When he returns to Chile
be will bÂ« arrested and court-martialed and
possibly dishonorably discharged from the
service. The cruiser will sail to-day for the
south.
Chilean Midshipman Deserts.
Propmtly at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Cajitaiu Wilson on the Pacific Mall dock
hauled the gangplanks ashore, the lines wÂ«re
CSt off and the steamship China straightened
cut for her tria to the Far East. She carried
SbCO tens of carjfo. 110 cabin passengers and
etiout 175 in the steerage, seventy of them
twins Japanese. A number of those subjects
cf the Mikado are members of Japan's military
reserve, and though they hav-e not been called
to take their places in the Ulne, they are
gc'ng home voluntarily for duty at the front.
7nty were eecorted to the stÂ«amshlp by tnelr

amid the rairiotic "banzai" of the Japs on

C1 f the world, is returning to his palace in
Cairo, Egypt. The Prince Is a cousin of the

<kes not live on the Bosporus. The Sultan
is reported to have a playful way, all his own,
of bowFtrtnging, or ehootlng. to be more mod
ern, his possible heirs, and a residence out of
the country is more healthful. So Aziz cuts
Turkey out of his itinerary.

Three men entered the saloon of "Wil
liam Lehing, 400 Fifth street, shortly
before midnight Monday night. Lehing
had just counted his cash and was
about to close the place. The men
forced him into a rear room and while
two kept' guard over him the third
broke open a cash box that was kept
on the drain board behind the bar.
About $2 in small change had' been left
by Lehing in the box and the thief took
out about a dollar's worth.
The three men then. ran out of the
saloon and, Lehing ran after them. He
met Policeman Madden and pointed out
the thieves. Madden thased them along
Perry street in the direction of Fourth.
He called upon them to stop and fired
a shot in the air to intimidate them.
One of them stopped and the other two
ran to the rear of 217 Perry street.
Madden, had been Joined by Police
man Farrell and after handcuffing their
prisoner they went in search of the
other two. They were found hiding be
hind a pile of boxes on the back porch
of the third story. r The officers drew
their revolvers and 'covering the two
men ordered them to throw up their
hands, which they did promptly. The
three prisoners were taken back to

fied them. They were booked at the
City Prison on a charge of robbery.
Their names are Patrick Bannon, alias
Alfred Murphy, a brother of "Lefty"

taken failed to reveal any trace of the
stolen coin.

a detailed account of the labor troubles that have been rife in the dis

Though this history of the strife between the Miners' Federation

set forth give an illuminating review of past and present conditions

of considerable value.

WE are surprised that some of the papers in Southern California
have developed opposition to the measure for completing the
seawall on the harbor front of San Francisco. One of these
papers, with much ill nature, declares that the wall is for the benefit
of San Francisco, therefore let San Francisco pay for it. This shows
a density of mind that is distressing. It is on a par with the opposi
tion to the new ferry building, because it would be used by the
Southern Pacific railroad. * Then we heard in various quarters hot
objection to taxing the people to build a depot for the Southern
Pacific, when in fact the proposition was to get authority to tax the
Southern Pacific and all other tenants of the new building higher
than they were taxed for the use of the old building. '
San Francisco has no more interest in the seawall than the
State has. The people are merely asked to vote authority for the
commerce of this city tt> build the seawall and pay for it. The wall
is needed to accommodate California's increasing sea trade. Its
construction will not cost the taxpayers a single dollar in taxes, for
the commerce that uses the new wall and docks will pay for their
construction. Already we have great P^fcific liners that can hardly
poke their noses into our existing docks.. They must have adequate
berths and are willing to pay for them when the new seawall per
mits their construction. So we may say broadly to objectors in
Southern California that- all San Francisco is asking is authority
from the voters to complete her seawall, enlarge her dock and wharf
room and pay for it herself out of her commerce. That is the fact
and we hope it will penetrate the density and darkness of some of
the Southern California newspapers.

FEMININE PHILOSOPHY
Why should not the people of San Francisco follow these high
and excellent examples? Why should any man here vote for a ju
dicial candidate simply because he is on the party ticket, thereby
retiring from the bench an incumbent who has proved himself
worthy ? It is the ripe judgment of the best American thinkers that
the integrity of our government and the perpetuation of our insti
tutions depend upon our judiciary. This being so, why should our
choice of judges.be influenced by the passions of partisanship, or by
vicious appeals to the prejudices of any section of the community?
Fortunately the majority of the newspapers in San Francisco see
aiike in this grave matter, and it will not be their fault if the city
fail to improve the present opportunity to inaugurate a reform that
will purge the judiciary of all suspicion of holding other obligations
than to the law. The re-election of Judges Murasky, Seawell, Troutt
and Kerrigan will immeasurably elevate and dignify the bench, and
will be, an honor to the city and a guide to the State.
IT is not because judicial courage and virtue are rare on the bench
that the people, regardless of politics, demand the re-election of
Judges Murasky, Seawell, Troutt and Kerrigan. The reason is
that the people do not wish such qualities in the courts to become
rare and exceptional, and propose to prevent such a decline by rec
ognizing them when they have been tried, tested and approved. -
As the city grows larger and older, and its interests multiply and
their interdependence becomes more complex, the need of learned
and upright courts increases. Time was when the Alcalde* was suffi
cient for the judicial affairs of the primitive community, out of which
San Francisco has grown. But we could not now go back to the
court of the Alcalde. One by one our Superior Courts have in
creased to meet the necessities of the growing litigation which is a
feature of our development. The friction of interests increases, and
patient and learned judges are required to protect the rights of all.
A judge must have no strings on him. If a judicial candidate
go among the voters pleading that he has favored one class in a
subordinate position, or that he will do so in the place that he seeks,
lie may get votes, but he is unfit for the bench. He mounts it with
strings on him, and they are a vicious part of the judicial equipment.
Such a candidate is in effect' bribed in advance. He seeks votes by
improper promises, actual or implied, in order that he may grasp
the emoluments of the office. Then he pays back the bribe by misuse
of the judicial authority, in behalf of those who gave.it or of their
friends. In this way is established the practical sale of justice for
a price, a condition intolerable in any society.
The general non-partisan movement for Judges Murasky, Troutt,
Seawell and Kerrigan is not only of great present importance, but
it is the beginning of a system that is of greater future importance.
It means that hereafter there will be less or no partisanship in the
selection of judges. It means that one who seeks the judicial office
will learn to rely only upon his known good character, legal ability
and reputation for possessing the judicial mind, for success. It
means also that when he has reached the bench by the possession
of such qualities he may depend upon a fairly permanent judicial
career, than which there is none more noble nor more important un
der our system of government.
Therefore it will be seen that each right-minded citizen has
more at stake in the re-election of Judges Murasky, Troutt, Seawell
and Kerrigan than has either one of those gentlemen. To each cit
izen the right administration of justice is more important than the
opportunity to administer it is to the judge charged with that duty.
By inattention to these considerations, affecting an impartial
judiciary, California is far behind the older States. In New York
it is provided in the law that there can be an impartial judiciary,
free from the strings of partisanship, from the courts of first instance
to those of last resort. Right in the midst of the present campaign
the Republican Governor of that State has appointed an eminent
jurist and Democrat to the vacancy on the bench of the Court of
Appeals caused by the resignation of Judge Parker. Even in the
Xew England States, that have long been one-sided politically, Dem
ocrats are appointed to the bench. In the Federal courts the same
course is followed. President Harrison appointed Judge Jackson of
Tennessee, a Democrat, to a Federal district judgeship, and Presi
dent Roosevelt has done the same with Judge Jones of Alabama, a
Democrat.

EXCURSION TO SANTA CRUZ.
It may be a difficult thing to prove a
Chinese marriage to the satisfaction of
an American court, but an attempt in
that direction lent spice to the pro
ceedings in Judge Coffey's department
yesterday.
The hearing was upon the petition of
the widow and relatives of Chew Bing
Quoia for the removal of J. J. Cunning
ham as administrator of the dead Chi
naman's estate, and- in his opening
statement Judge Dibble of counsel for
the petitioners stated plainly that Cun
ningham's appoiStment was the result
of fraud practiced upon the widow and
the court, and, furthermore,, that Cun
ningham had not made a full account-
Ing of his trust. E^ J. 'Hill represented
the administrator and Vogelsang &
Brown ' and Judge 'Dibble looked after
the family's side of the case.- The rela
tives want Chew Quon appointed ad
ministrator.
Chew Bing Quoia died in June, 1903,
and as no inventory of his estate had

The deceased -was a contractor who
supplied laborers for the Alaska pack

time of his death. These, it is said,

Special Policeman Berg, who , had
found the woman' with her right hand
on the rifle, testified that she told him
then that sha asked the Japanese jok
ingly: "Shall I shoot, yoÂ« or not?"
and then the gun was discharged. She
had made several different and con
tradictory statements afterward.
The jury returned a verdict that No

"accidentally fired by Mrs. Forsythe
while under the influence of liquor."
' The jury in the case ' of ex-Rev.
Charles J. Adams, who killed himself
because of love for Maud Ellson, a
young woman with whom he had as
sociated, returned a verdict yesterday
that death resulted from poison taken
with suicidal intent. ;
She remembered tucking the butt of
the rifle under her left' arm and then
seeing the luckless Japanese sink to
the floor. The. trigger,- might-have
caught in her shawl, which was,fast
ened across her breast. Â¦ r ,^ , â¢Â¦
"If I fired the shot, It was an' acci

"My husband's name was Edward,"
responded the witness with freezing
dignity. Then she satd that on Mon
day, October 18, she came downtown
to pay a grocer's bill. By the time
she got to the shooting gallery she was
so drunk, she said with refreshing can
dor, that she had -no recollection of
firing the shot.
"I used to shoot a bow and arrow
when I was a little girl," she con
tinued, "and I thought I'd, like to

shabbily dressed in black' and topped
with a. black sailor hat, ..the brim of
which had been lessened by the re
lentless tooth of time, sat in the wit

room of Coroner Leland and told the
Jury how she happened to kill W. No
da, the Japanese proprietor of a
shooting gallery at 815 Kearny street.
"My name is Mrs. Frances, Forsythe
or Edward Forsythe," she began.
"Well, which of these names do you
go by?" asked the Coroner, with the
air of a physician diagnosing a fever.

By yielding to the dictates of an in
herent . spirit of chivalry Samuel Uren
disturbed the peace and committed bat
tery. When he saw John Darts, , able
peaman, detaining the fair hand of the

with evident sincerity to release her
imprisoned digits, he sprang to the res
cue and delivered a right punch with

Mrs. Mary McElroy of 279 Btevenson
ctreet enjoys the distinction, rare to her
eex, of having captured by force of
arms and turned Into police custody a
male burglar of no mean physical
prowess. Having missed portable
property from her domicile at different
times Mrs. McElroy, after Investigation
and logical deduction, concealed her
eelf in a room occupied by John Perry.
one of her boarders, and there patiently
lay in wait until William" Blum, a
young man of sturdy physique, entered
through the window and began seeking
something worth stealing. Then/ehe
suddenly pounced upon him. pinned his
arms to his sides and lustily yelled for
help. John" Perry responded, but his
aid was hardly needed, for Mrs. McEl-.
roy.had her prisoner bo securely in her
power that he was helpless until Pa
trolman W. G. Doran arrived and re
lieved her of his custody.
When the defendant was arraigned
before Judge Mogan he said he had
never been arrested before, but Officer
Doran submitted excerpts from the
police records which showed that he
had been convicted of burglary and al
lowed to go on his awn recognizance
because of his .youth and apparent de
termination to reform. Then his case
was set for hearing next Saturday.
Dr. A. W. Morton of 775 Cole street,
)>y whom ibe dtft-ndant had been em
ployed as a servant, suggested that his
mentality T>e subjected tp examina
tion, as it seemed to be deranged. So
ordered.
Judge Mogan also provided a case
for the Lunacy Commission by re
manding T. G. Pilklngton, the haughti
ly obdurate British subject who ex
pressed contempt for American insti
tutions in general and the Magistrate
of Police Department No. 1 in partic
ular. When called for sentence yes
terday Mr. Pilkington wagged an ln
timidatory forefinger at the bench and
exclaimed:
"If you . send me to prison you'll
certainly hear of it again."
"What do you mean?" asked the
Judge.
".Never mind, sir, never mind," was
the severe rejoinder.
Dr. de Vecchl told Judge Cabaniss
that he had investigated the mental
condition of A. B. Bagley, charged
with having passed a forged check on
an opticlcn. and was convinced that
man was irresponsible. If the Lunacy
Commission report a similar finding
Mr. Bagiey will be committed to an
eFjium for the Insane.
Mrs. Connolly claims to have a hus
band somewhere and says she has
vorked for a livelihood. Her neigh
bors, however, aver that if she did toil
the rewards of her labor were mostly
spent for Intoxicating liquor, as she
was drunk almost daily.
Householders residing on the first
block of Page street are interchanging
congratulations on the removal from
their midst of Mrs. Mary Connolly,
who will bÂ« sentenced to-day by Po
lice Judffe Mogan for having cruelly
neglected her 2-year-old babe. ' The
Â¦woman's unpopularity in the neigh
borhood may be estimated from a per
usal of this petition, presented to the
owner of the cellar which she occu
pied:
"5Ve, the undersigned, hereby ask
you to start proceedings to eject the
tenant in the basement of 30 Page
etreet. es she is a habitual drunkard
and a menace to the safety of our

hope that you will attend to this at

borhood." (Signed by Peter F. Roth,

until the latter bethought themselves
of enlisting the aid of the California
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children. The secretary of that or
ganization, Mr. White, promptly re
sponded to the appeal. Finding the
Connolly infant in a filthy and seml-
Ftaxved condition, he haled the mother
Into court, where the neighbors testi
fied that the little one had been most
shamefully neglected by its drunken
guardian. So the babe was turned
over to the care of the Associated
Charities and the mother remanded
for sentence.
. Mr. West was climbing over the tran
som of a Third-street saloon when Pa
trolman Tillman perceived him and
suggested that he descend. When the
hint was compiled with the prisoner
admitted that he had been committing
burglary and delivered to his' custo
dian $20 65 which he had taken from
the saloon till. In court he pleaded
guilty and said that destitution drove
him to crime. % .
Judge Fritz claims a record for dis
patch in passing an accused felon
through the preliminary. stage of trial.
Allen West was arrestea at, 4:30
o'clock yesterday morning for' burg
lary, and at 11 o'clock a. m. he had
been arraigned and remanded for trial
in the Superior Court, -with bail fixed
at $2000.
Abraham Raymond, a native . of
Bombay, was arrested while drunk

John Clark, who was so difficult to
awaken that the vigilant Maloney
searched for a hidden knife or bullet
wound, could not remember just what
impelled him to woo the drowsy god*
upon the sward of Union square.
Eighteen years ago he had an epi
leptic fit and maybe that had some
thing ' to do with it. Plea ridiculed
and twenty-four hours prescribed.
"And then you awoke to find your

"I Just sat down to rest," Mr. Smith
informed Judge Mogan, "'and uncon
sciously dropped into trie arms of
Morpheus."
Henry C. ,Offney, who was found
fast asleep at midday in Union square,
said that he had started out tq. escort
his wife on a shopping tour arid
walked until -he-was very'tired, while
she displayed not the%llghtest symp
tom of fatigue. .So he decided to rest
upon one of the benches beneath the
shadow of the St Francis until she
completed her purchases, and while
seated there he dropped into slumber.
Story doubted, but case â¢ dismissed.
Harry Smith, elegantly appareled
and carrying a silk hat, was similarly
charged by Patrolman Maloney, who
testified that the defendant's snores
made the square vocal.
Patrolman Collins had a small,
neatly folded package in his hand as
he Informed Judge Cabaniss that A.
Paladin! was arrested for attempting
to sell one silver bass whose avoirdu
pois was below the legal minimum of
three pounds. To clinch his charge^
he added, he had seized the fish and
would take pleasure in exhibiting its
diminutive proportions to the- court:
Then he started to unroll the package,
but ere he had removed the inner fold
the court, with nose tightly clamped
between finger and thumb, was assur
ing him that the production of mate
rial evidence was not necessary. So
the case was closed, the defendant
pronounced guilty and a $50 fine im
posed.

Joseph Declune, accused of stealing

his dismissal was received with a hys

"All my life I have been such a slave
to coffee that the very aroma of It was
enough to set my nerves quivering. I
kept gradually losing my health, but I
used to say, 'Nonsense, It don't hurt me.'
Slowly I was forced to admit the truth
and the final result was that my whole
nervous force vj&8 shattered.
"My heart became .weak and un-
certain in its action/and that frightened
me. Finally my physician told me,
about a year ago, that I must stop
drinking coffee or I could never expect
to be well again.
"I was in despair, for th'e very thought
of the medicines I had tried so many
times nauseated me. Of course I
thought of Postum, but could hardly
>ring myself to give up the coffee.
Finally I concluded that I owed it: to
myself to "give Postum a trial. So I
#ot a package and carefully followed
the directions; and what a delicious,
nourishing, rich drink it was! Do you
know I found it very easy to shift
from the toffee to Postum and not mind
the change at all. Almost immediately
after I made the change I : found my-
self better! and as the days.went^by I
kept, on Improving. My nerves grew'
pound and steady, I slept well and felt
strong and well balanced all the time.
Now I am -^completely cured, with the
old nervousness and sickness. all' gone.
In every way I am well once more."

~ "TYPHOID FEVER." "
"REXRADIO" quickly expels Typhoid
Fever. H. C. Knott. 112 Fell St.. waa last
week prostrated with this deadly fever. Hla
symptoms were alarming, fever, extreme,
pulse at highest, temperature excessive, vora-
1 Ited "blood." At height of fever Rexradio's
first treatment quickly started a profuss
sweat, when all extreme symptoms largely
subsided right away, pulsÂ« and temperature
became nearly normal. After second treat-
ment (same day) further copious sweating,
followed speedily by perfectly normal pulsa
and temperature, and complete cessation oÂ£
blood vomiting. Patient became cool. easy,
restful, slept long, soundly. Next morning
felt weak but well, and went out to transact
I business all day. To date no relapse, and pa-
tient has quickly recuperated. To-day hÂ«
said: "I am feeling pc-fectly well. I owÂ«
my wonderful recovery, and perhaps my
'life,' to Rexradlo's 'non-medical' treatment
alone. He used no medicine but Just parsed
his 'humanized Radium' power Into me. which
Instantly thrilled my whole body, promptly
abatliur the sever* pains and fever In a most
surprising manner, producing a refroahins
: coolness and strength all over me. I am as-
tounded at my rapid and complete cure, and
as a small token of my practical gratitude I
have Insisted on Rexradlo's acceptance of a
block of stock in a gold mine with which Z
am connected. Language is too poor to ex-
press my appreciation of his truly marvelous
power. While be is around I shall never
again dread Typhoid.' I an) willing to
'swear* to the truth of the above statement."
"PHYSICIANS TESTIFY."
"REXRADIO" last week by one brief treat-
ment publicly restored many totally deaf ears.
some of which were witnessed by one of thÂ«
most noted city "physicians" (name at of-
fices), who signed the testimony, vouching for
Its correctness. Another physician brousht a
"deaf mute." who in 3 seconds began to hear
and speak. A third physician, at hall, pub-
licly counseled alleged "Incurables" by medi-
cine to try Rexradio's power. When these,
"physicians"* Indorse this treatment, "lay-
men" may do well to "Investigate" it.
" Â¦REXRADIO'S' one treatment entirely cured
the paralysis with which my baby was
'born.' " Mrs. Allen, 379 Bartlett.
"REXRADIO" * has recently made several
"deaf mutes" hear and speak before numer-
ous witnesses. One caae was witnessed by

ness."

STOCKS â I do not think that the market
baa yet soent its force. The great mass of
djvidead-paylar stocks are still worth more
au an investment than the money in the bank.
The tide of general business activity has
turned and all conditions favor its continuance.
The incitement such as we are now having
xnxdly Â«rer stop* at a rational stopping
point; It goes too far. I do not think that
the too-far point has yet been reacheU.
COTTON â The cotton market was nervous
and tiasetUed. but on the whole a fairly strong
ucderton* prevailed during the day and the
buylag power was sufficient to absorb all
Â©Jreriags. Ellisons estimates this season's con
sumptive requirements at 10,SK)0.C00 bales, and
Xhit is regarded as bullish. The sentiment is
leeÂ» bearish at the moment, although there
xs nothing In the situation to warrant con
fidence ::. any sustained advances
COFFEEâ The movement at Brazilian ports
continues to be watched with much interest
by lae trade, for if thÂ« yield is- to come to
the estimate of e.500,000 bags there will cer
tainly have to be a sharp falling off in the
receipts In the very near future. Persistent
*es>orts. however, continue to come in regaril
ing the unsatisfactory conditions for the next
crop and the belief is generally growing that
It will be under ten millions.

fruit was marketed and several more were re
ported close at band and due at , any time.
Firs were offering again. Regular site boxes
from Stockton brought 73c and large packages
from , Martinez sold at $1 25. The other treÂ«
fruits stood about as previously quoted, the
demand . being fair and supplies of air kinds
ample. Grapes were - unchanred. but th*
market was weak and ther* was plenty of poor
stock available at easy rates. Strawberries,

forms the collateral for these bonds, makes
the payment of interest a burden on Union
Pacitic, heavy capital requirements would have
to be met to retire them and the release of
Northern Securities stock would be the only Â¦
advantage perceptible. But it waÂ» assumed,
in epite of the - emphatic official' disclaimers,
that a settlement of the Northern Securities
dispute ar.d^a community of interest â¢ in the!
transcontinental railroad world was involved.
The buoyant rise in St. Paul: was regarded as
corroborative of this assumption. : â¢ The mar
ket was subjected to enormous profit-taking
throughout the day and the result wa^con
stant Irregularity and occaFional -weakness.
The - profit-taking in the low-priced stocks,
which were most conspicuous in yesterday's
market, was very obvious throughout, but. was
ignored unti! late in the day. The facility
with which strength was malntalred at other
points in face dl this selling movement and
the small effect of the gold engagements was
pointed to aa further gratifying evidence of
the underlying strength 'of the market. But
when attempts were made to take profits on
the day's, unwieldy- commitments the vulner- ;
able position of the market developed and
prices crumbled rapidly. The day's most con- ;
slderable gains were wiped out with a rush
and Union Pacific's nst gain proved small.
Losses were the rule, running between 1 and 2
points, and even more in many cases.
Bonds were irregular. Total sales, par
value, f 11, 047,000.
United States bonds vrere unchanged on call.

. Gamage, it is alleged, knew of the
insolvency matter, but on August 22
last appeared before Justice Daniels
and represented that he was acting for
the olaintiff in the old case. Dobler
says that the court was ignorant of
the situation and Gamage "falsely and
fraudulently" obtained Judgment-
The complainant further declares
that Gamajre had not then nor has
he at any time been admitted to prac
tice.
John Dobler yesterday sued for an
injunction to prevent Samuel New
man and Jules C. Gamage from ex
ecuting a judgment obtained against
himfor SI 36 in Justice Daniels* court.
The complainant accuses Gamage of.
practicing fraud and abusing the pro
cess of the court to extort money
from the plaintiff. The debt is an
old one. Dobler was sued . by New
man in June, 1887, but on a show
ing that he was unable tp pay his ob
ligations he. went through insolvency
proceedings. Newman was appointed
receiver and got $12 as a preferred
creditor. '>, : -

The first of the speakers last night
was Joseph O'Connor, president of the

nor told briefly of tne object of the
gathering and introduced former Mayor
Phelan, who spoke on behalf of Mr.
McCreery. Mr. Phelan read a letter
he received from Mr. McCreery regret
ting the fact that a previous engage
ment compelled his absence. He then
went, on to tell of the early work done
by Mr. McCreery for the city and for
mally presented the library.
Mayor Schmitz on behalf of the city
thanked the donor for the gift and told
of the incalculable good it would do.
He related the history of the new li
brary and the generosity of Mr. Mc-

R. C. Clarke, secretary of the Board
of Library Trustees, followed in a
short speech on behalf of the residents
of the Eureka Valley section of the
city and thanked the donor heartily
and sincerely.
The new branch public library No. 2,
hereafter to be known as the Mc-
Creery Library, after its donor, An
drew B. McCreery, was formally pre
sented to the city last night by former
Mayor James D. Phelan on behalf of
Mr. McCreery and accepted by Mayor
Schmitz on behalf of the city. The
presentation took place in the presence
of members of the Board of Library
Trustees, officers of the McCreery Li
brary and residents of the district in
which the new building is situated. The
ceremonies were simple and brief, as
requested by the donor, and the build
ing will at once be. opened for use.
The new library is situated on Noe
street, near Market, between Pond and
Prosper streets. The building is Bur
rounded by green lawns, made possible
by the courtesy of the Park Commis
sioners. The entire cost exceeds $50,
000. "vÂ«"^
It was calculated that the city is los
ing about $20,000 yearly by non-pay
ment of the licenses. Smith will detail
ten men to-day to serve notices on the
delinquent owners. If these owners do
not comply at once warrants will be
â¢worn out for their arrest. The Finance
Committee agreed to supplement the
Tax -Collector's efforts in whatever
manner he deemed advisable.
The committee will visit the tax of
fice on Monday to inspect its workings.
Comparisons will be made with the li
censes paid in other cities with a view
to revising the existing ordinances If
deemed advisable. The object of the
conference was merely to arrive at
means to improve the collecting -of the
city's revenues.
' At a conference held yesterday by the
Supervisors' Finance Committee and
Tax Collector. Smith it was decided to
begin a crusade against nickel-in-the
slot machines on which no license tax
is paid. Smith said there were between
400 and 500 such machines in this city.
He was directed to compel payment of
the licenses, and refusal to pay will re
eult in the arrest of owners.
The Collector said that no assistance
â¢was given by the Police Department in
the matter, the Police Commissioners
claiming that the machines are unlaw
ful under four decisions of the Supreme
Court. The Finance Committee thought
it would be a good opportunity to de
termine the legality of maintaining the
machines. If the owners refused to pay
the license then they must either re
move the machines or submit to arrest,
the committee said. >*:.

CLEVER YOUNG ACTRESS WHO
WILL. BE SEEN NEXT WEEK AT
THE GRAND, v
Markham's resignation was forward
ed to President Harriman four weeks
ago with a request that it be accepted
as soon as possible. Immediately upon
its receipt in the East he was sum
moned to Chicago, where an effort was
made by Director of Maintenance and
Operations Kruttschnltt and other Har
riman officials to induce him to recon
sider his plans and stay with the cor
poration.
The retirement of General Manager
Markham was a surprising bit of in
formation to the majority of the rail
road chiefs in the railroad building
yesterday and they hastened to their
superior's office, eager to get a personal
confirmation of the announcement.
Markham is regarded as a very capable
railroad man. having risen from the
position of section hand through vari
ous branches of the traffic and operat
ing departments to his present office.
He came here about six months ago
from the Harriman lines in Texas as
successor to Julius Kruttschnitt and
during his short stay here he has made
himself extremely popular with the
public and his associates in the rail
road world.
It was stated yesterday by General
Manager Markham that the Southern;
Pacific officials had not yet decided
who will succeed him but he expets
they will find a man within the next
few days.
Charles H. Markham, general man
ager of the Pacific system of the South
ern Pacific Company, has resigned his
position to accept a similar one, with
the Guffey Petroleum Company of
Texas. The announcement of his re
tirement from the railroad company
was formally made by him yesterday
arid will take effect as soon as his suc
cessor is named, by President E. . H.
Harriman. â¢ In making his announce
ment General Manager Markham said
yesterday:
I am about to leave the employ of the
Southern Pacific Company for no other reason
than I have been offered another position
which Insures me a larger salary. I will re
tire from the road with the deepest regret
and, I am sure, with the best wishes of my
present employers. For several months nego
tiations between the men who control the
Guffey Petroleum Company and myself have
been going on and have finally resulted* In my
accepting the position of general manager of
the latter concern. I do not know exactly
when I will leave the railroad company, but
it will be immediately after its officers have
selected a man to succeed me.
; The lieutenant again demanded that
| the officer arrest him. and Handley
I complied. While waiting for the patrol
i wagon the lieutenant said to Handley.
"I will give you. a merry time for this,"
and Handley.told him to go ahead. The
lieutenant was driven in the patrol
wagon to the City Hall station, where
a charge of disturbing the peace was
I booked against him. He gave his cor
rect name and his occupation as a "sol
'dler." He was locked in a cell, but was
I released on $10 cash ball shortly after 6
o'clock in the morning.
Handley pushed his way through the
crowd and . asked the lieutenant what
was the matter. '
"There Is nothing the matter," said
the lieutenant.
"Well," said Handley, "you seem to
be the center of .attraction, and there
must be something the matter."
"Arrest me. arrest me," angrily re
torted the lieutenant. "I am the nephew
of the President. I want you to lock
me up."
' "I shall certainly arrest you," said
Handley. "if you don't tell me what'3
the. matter."
"What are you giving me?" he sai'd,
as he shot out his right hand and
caught Lowenberg on the Jaw. Lowen
berg returned the blow and was get
ting the worst of the encounter when a
man with a black mustache went to his
assistance. This man was knocked out
of business in quick order by the lieu
tenant, who abruptly left the scene and
walked toward Eddy street. He was
followed by a crowd, which attracted
the attention of Policeman F. W. Hand
ley.
â¢ Lieutenant Granville R. Fortescue of
the Tenth United States Cavalry, a
nephew of President Roosevelt, who re
turned on the steamer Doric from the
Orient on Monday after spending some
time with the Japanese forces as a spe
cial representative of the army, with
the object of making a report to Wash
ington on the progress of the war, had
the' unenviable experience of being con
fined for six hours in a cell at the City
Hall police station yesterday morning.
He was arrested on a charge of dis
turbing the peace, and failing to appear
in Â¦ Judge Cabaniss' court yesterday
forenoon his bail of 510 was declared
forfeited.
The lieutenant, dressed in a tuxedo
suit. ' had been making a disturbance
in Techau's Tavern, on Mason street,
and was finally induced to leave about
midnight. A hack ' was standing in
front of the entrance and the lieuten
ant/jumped into it. S..G. Loweriberg,
the hackman, was in the act of closing
the door when the lieutenant came out
and demanded to see Lowenberg's li
cense. Lowenberg showed him his
badge, but that did not satisfy the lieu
tenant.

the pianos they play upon, but certainly I do not belong to that class.
