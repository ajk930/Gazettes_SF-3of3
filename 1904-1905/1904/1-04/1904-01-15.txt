WINNEMUCCA, New, Jan. 14.â
Workmen engaged in digging gravel
here to-day uncovered at a depth of
about twelve feet a lot of bones that
once were part of the skeleton of a gi
gantic human being.
Joseph Rougon, who was in charge of
the work, examined the bones and at
once decided that they were those of a
man or a woman. They were taken to
Dr. Samuels, who examined them thor
oughly and pronounced them to be the
bonos of a man who must have been
nearly eleven feet in height.
Â¦ The metacarpal bones measure four
and a half inches in length and ere
large in proportion. A part of the ulna
was found which in complete form
would have been between seventeen
and eighteen inches In length. The re
maining part of the skeleton is being

Insists Upon Jurisdiction Over AH
Korean Territory.
BERLIN, Jan. 14.â Japan's main
points in her last note are understood
here officially to be that Japan con
sents to eliminate Manchuria from tha
controversy, owing to the signature oC
the commercial treaty between China
and Japan and Russia's assurances
that China's commercial conventions
will be respected. Japan, therefore, re
stricting her claims to Korea, asks for
a definite, written guarantee that IJus
sla will abstain from interference In
the politics of that country, thus leav
ing Korea exclusively to Japanese ; In
fluence.. Japan, rejecting the proposed
neutral zone. as. delimited by Russia,
proposes a neutral zone. If Russia still
deems one desirable, which shall con
sist of equal territories, oT Korea and
Manchuria, including the Yalu River,
with all Russia's fortifications thereon.
Finally. Japan fixes no limit of time,
but earnestly expresses the hope that
Russia will not delay a definite and
favorable reply to Japan's reasonable
requests. Japan alludes to her privi
lege of. discontinuing the negotiations
should it appear that Russia is unwill
ing to accept these minimum propo
sals.
The note, though not altogether pre
cluding further negotiations, has a cer
tain finality in its tone implying that
the correspondence is closed on the slda
of Japan. It Is not believed that Rus
sia will consider the proposed neutral
zone suggested by Japan. No authori
tative opinion is obtainable as to Rus
sia's pfobable reply and the situation
islJkely to be prolonged for a good
many days and possibly for weeks.

The food was In such a' condition .that
I could readily recognize the 'different
substances that the man had partaken
of at his last meal. .The' chili peppers,
so much used In Mexican; dishes,' were
plainly visible. If. I were to tell you

"It was possibly within one. hour and

That Joseph Blaise was -murdered
shortly after he left the": Mexican - res
taurant in company of Soeder is
beyond dispute. â¢ '-'- ' â¢ â¢
Mr. and Mrs. J. XI bin us, landlord and
Soedcr claims tliat on Sunday evening
last he returned from dinner with
Blstee at 5:SO; that shortly after.
Blaise went for a wait and never
returned. Soeder claims that he re
mained in his room from 5:30 Sun
day evening until the' next morn-
Ins:.
At the Mexican restaurant, 721 Broad
way, the proprietor and attaches
pay that Socder always paid for the
meals and Uiat Blaise was never
Lnown to do so.
J. N'iblauf, landlord of the house at
Â£27. Jacltsou t-trcct, where. Soeder
and Blaise roomed, declares that
Ulaibc never displayed any' money
and tluit Soedcr always paid the
bills.
Soeder claims that Blaise l^id consid
erable racney on his person when he
v.cnt for a walk alone the night
before he was found dead.
The body of Blaise is found the next
morning at the foot of Russian Hill,
death hating been caused by a stab
in the throat. -The pockets of the
trousers of Blaise were turned In
side out, â¢ indicating that robbery
was the motive of the murder.
On Sunday, January 10, Soedcr and
Blaise dine at a Mexican restaurant,
721 Broadway, and leave there at
7:30 p. in.
Soeder secures an accident policy on
tne ltfe of Blaise for $3000, s this
amount to be paid to Soedcr in the
event of the death of Blaise, and
applies for a $7000 policy on Blaise
in his (Soeder's) favor.
On reaching San Francisco, Soeder
again tries . to insure the life of
Blaise for $10,000, but is given a
policy of only $3000. This policy
is in favor of the wife and children
of Blaise.
Arriving: In Xew York, Soeder at

SUMMARY OF THE :EVTDEXCE-
O vercoat , : : belonging to. . Soeder .is
specked -with red soil, similar in
, character to that . at the : base of
Kusslan . HlW, . where" Blaise . was
murdered. J
Spot .where Blaise was . murdered : Is
.three and a half blocks from the
room- where - Boeder nnd Blaise re
sided. '
Mexican restaurant where Soeder and
Blaise dined is only two blocks from
the.room in which they lived.
Examination of the stomach of Blaise
by Dr. Bacigalupi, autopsy 'surgeon
4o Coroner Leland, proves the mur
dered man died within one hour
and not more than two hours after
he - had eaten dinner with Soeder
j lust Sunday evening.
The police also find in Soeder's room
on Jackson street a bottle of chlo
roform and one of carbolic acid. -
The police locate the trunk at the
Five-Mile House an$l find In It a
pair of old shoes. In the shoes were
two uotties of hydrocyanic add, the
most deadly . poison known to sci
ence.
On January" 8 j-Soeder removed an
empty trunk from the home of 3Iiss
â Flatley \ arid '. conveyed it to the
FIverMile - House, 4280 "\ Mission
: . "street, ' saying j he might call for it
in three or^.f our days, and if he did
. not that' it might be destroyed.
Statement by Miss Catherine Flatley
that Soeder desired 'to marry her
and that he recently Informed her
. that he, would shortly be in posses
sion of : $7000, which he expected
from- Germany.- â¢ '
Soeder, â¢ under pressure' of questioning
after arrest, admits that he had two
wives; that his first wife 5 was Eliz
abeth Nifs; that she went to Europe
Â¦ and- Is 'presumed by 'him to have
died there.
Soedcr's house at Petaluma was burn
ed down shortly after his wife died;
It was insured in a number of com
panies, but payment -of insurance
was not made : by the Â¦companies;
the case being a 'suspicious one of
Incendiarism, r
Soeder's wife, formerly a Miss'Miran
da, died last-i February" In Petaluma
and Soeder ? collected $2000 insur
ance on her life. Many rumors'' were
heard that the N woman - had ! = died
from poison, her death having, been
sudden. â¢ ; .
Police Department discovers that Soe
der is an ex -convict, having served
Â¦ three years for burglary in" San
Quentin. -\ tfSS
Soeder also pawned a ; revolver and
cartridges last .Monday, morning.
After the body of Blaise was found
nnd detectives . visited Soetler's
room, he returned to his' room and
secured Uie policies which had been
Issued on the life of Blaise. '
Police find that .; Soeder took - a dark
gray sack sni( to a cleaning shop
early last 3Ioiiday^ morning and
asked that It be cleaned at once.
When questioned by the police .last
Monday, Soeder asserted that he did
not possess such a suit. â¢ " '.
Soeder was seen wearing a dark gray
sack suit last \ Sunday evening.
Mr. and Mrs. CN'iblaos say that .they
never knew. Blaise , to . go out alone
at night.'. Blaise could . not speak
English and was bat little acquaint
ed with the city.
On Monday morning last Soeder in
. formed his landlord that lie feared
' that Blaise bad met with foul play,
_ "as Ire had remained away from' his
room nil night. ., -"â¢*Â¦â¢'Â»
Soeder's assertion that he remained in
. the room all Sunday evening is dis
â¢ proved by Mrs. Xiblaus, who says
that tlie lainp-for Soeder's room was
ft 111 filled with oil on the following
day, showing that the lamp had not
been used, j >' . *- \ . .
landlady of Soedcrj positively "state
that they neither saw a light in
SoederV room last' Sunday "evening
nor heard any one in that room up
to 10:30 p. in.
"The honor of the United States de
mands prompt disavowal by the Con
gress of the United States, whose con
stitutional prerogative had been in
vaded by the lawless and unconstitu
tional acts of the chief executive."
Such disavowal would* mean compen
sation in some form. Newiands added:
"Had these outrages been committed
by the executive a 'great power
Congress would promptly disavow
them, and shall the impotence of Co
lombia disqualify her , from receiving
satisfaction for injury inflicted on her
by the unconstitutional action of this
country's chief; executive?"
Depew spoke in support . of the ad-,
ministration in its conduct on the istn
mus "and said' that the opponents of
"the treaty were aiding the enemies or
the canal. Â¦
' "If." he continued, ; "there ever was
a concert' of action : among any great
railway- corporations to /-defeat this
most Â¦.beneficent work of commerce and'
civilization I am not aware of it, but
if such a combination does exist then
its allies and ; its most efficient assist
ants are , to be found ' among those who,
Newiands said he was willing to ad
mit that the spirit of Â¦.. the treaty of
184<J called for the building of the canal.
But, even with that construction. Co
lombia's refusal 'to allow the building
of the canal would not have been
authority sufficient for the landing of
United States troops in Panama as the
result of the recent Insurrection. New
lands also complained that the Presi
dent had prematureiy recognized Pan
ama. The established methods of
diplomacy were ignored, and immedi
ate and prompt r.rmed intervention
and a display of force .were made Tvith-^
out complyfng with the formal proced
ure required â¢ by international law.
Newiands said it was doubtful whether
the status which ' existed . before, the
war could be restored. A new govern
ment'had been created by the violent
actions of the United States Govern
ment, lie said:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â The Senate
to-day listened to speeches by New
lands and Latinier in advocacy of the
adoption of a plan for the improve
ment of public wagon roads of the
country. Newiands declared that the
course of . the President in Panama
was an act of war and in contraven
tion of the treaty of 1846, of interna
tional law- and of the^constitutlon of
the United States. Depew praised the
President's policy as patriotic and
justified by precedent and law.

The United States claims that it ha*
political as well as commercial inter
est in Manchuria, and should that
province be annexed by the Czar a
protest from Washington, from what
was said to-day, is likely to go to St.
Petersburg.
Sir Mortimer Durand. the British
Embassador, had a conference with
Secretary Hay on the Far Eastern sit
uation to-day. Advices on the sub
ject received at the British embassy
are of a gloomy nature.
This Government has been advised
that Japan feels that she can lose no
more, or little more, as a result of an
unsuccessful war with the Czar's forces
than she would lose now by giving;
way to the Russian proposals. She
believes therefore that war will do her
no great harm except in a financial
way, and may do her immense good.
She holds that the integrity of Chi
na and Korea are worth -fighting for.
particularly as, acording to her view,
one of -them will pass Into Russia's
possession and the annexation of the
other, by Russia be merely postponed
by the acceptance of the present plan
of the '.Czar's Government for the ar
rangement of the present difficulties.
TUe administration 13 not well
pleased with the assurance given to
Secretary Hay by Count Cassini, thÂ»
Russian Embassador. on Monday, that
the "Russian authorities would place
no obstacle in the way of a full en
joyment by the powers having treaties
with China of all rights and privi
leges guaranteed by such treaties In
Manchuria."
This is taken to mean the assump
tion on the part of Rus3ia hereafter
that she is to be sovereign in Manchu
ria, and that idea i3 resented here on
the ground that all power3 which par
ticipated in the suppression of the
Boxer uprising of 1900 are pledged to
respect the territorial integrity of
China. f f -
No other deduction is to be drawn
from the terms of the Japanese re
sponse communicated to Russia to-day
than that, unless the modifications sug
gested be made, Japan will go to war.
While not an ultimatum, the Japanese
note makes it clear that the negotia
tions cannot be prdlonged unless Rus
sia offer concessions.
The position assumed by Japan is
that she must refuse to accept the Rus
sian proposal that a neutral zone em
bracing nearly one-third^ of Korea be
established, and must insist on the
maintenance of territorial integrity of
both China and Korea, although will
ing to recognize Russia's special inter
ests in Manchuria in return for ths
recognition by Russia of Japan's spe
cial interests in Korea.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â Japan's re
ply to Russia is couched in terms that
make practically certain its rejection.
The reply is so worded as to indicate
that it is the last step Japan will take
toward a peaceful solution of her dis
pute with Russia. ' Unless Russia back
down ignomlniously, diplomatic rela
tions will be severed on the receipt of
Russia's answer. This Is the informa
tion that has been conveyed to the
State Department.

WASHINGTON, Jan.
14. â -Japan is deter
mined to fight for
her contentions in regard to
affairs in the Far East, and
Russia will not yield an inch
from the stand she took in
her last note.
This was the information
conveyed to the State De
partment to-day through of
ficial channels, and no hope
is held in administration cir
cles that war can be, averted.
The State Department is
fully advised as to what
Japan insists upoir and what
she intends to do if her op
ponent is obdurate.
That the efforts which
England, France and Ger
many are making â or pre
paring to^ make â to induce
Japan not to engage in hos
tilities will come to nothing
the department knows to be
a fact. Modification of Rus
sian attitude is the only
thing that will insure a con
tinuance of peace.
Takahira, the Japanese
Minister, had a long talk to
day with Secretary Hay, to
whom he explained fully the
attitude of his Government
and what it intended to do if
Russia remained impervious
to Japan's suggestions. Tak
ahira left with Hay a
statement of the terms of
the last Russian note and
the Japanese response there
to, which, Hay was in
formed, was transmitted to
the Russian Government
this morning.
Japan in this communica
tion * declines to make any
further concessions, and sug
gests modification in the
Russian proposals, which she
regards as absolutely neces
sary to the safeguarding of
her interests in both Man
churia and Korea.

store opened a door in the sidewalk
In front of his place of business, and
was met by a sheet of flame. During
the firet fire sparks had dropped under
the sidewalk and had smoldered for
hours, bursting into a. blaze when the
door was opened.
A high Wind was blowing, arid the fire
soon- spread from the drugstore to
other buildings. The efforts made to
stop the fire* were fruitless, and not
until three blocks in the business part
were burned out and a block and a
half of residences'- consumed did there
come a lull' in the wind and a change
in Its direction. Then there was noth
ing left to be destroyed.
.Havre is a border town and a rail
road junction point and. it has . many
transient hard cases. While the fire
was at Its height some of these men
tried to loot the stores that" were in the
path of the fire. The commanding of
ficer at Fort Assinlbolrie, was asked /or
help and he. sent a company of soldiers
to the town to prevent looting. The
soldiers are. on guard duty to-night. ,
A conservative estimate, places the
loss at $350,000. ..with about $145,000 in
surance. Many people were rendered
homeless, but there was no loss of life.
Offers of assistance have been sent by
other towns in the State.
The principal losses In both fires
were: Frank Chestnut, building and
saloon stock, $10,000, insurance $6000;
Stringfellow Drug Company, $18,000,
insurance $5000; Sykes furniture house,
$14,000, insurance $8000; Montana' Sup

HELENA, Mont, Jan. 14.â As a re
sult of a fire which started shortly after
midnight Wednesday at Havre, in the
northern part of the State, the entire
business portion of the town has been
wiped out, entajling a financial loss
of 5350.000. The fire started from some
unknown cause in an alley between
a saloon and a business house on the
main business street. In the immedi
ate vicinity were a number of flimsy
structures. There was an inadequate
water supply, and by daylight, when
the fire was thought to be out, the loss
had reached $60,000, with half that
amount covered by insurance.

FAMED SOLDIER
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 14.â Mme.
Patti was virtually ordered out of the
Portland Hotel in this, city to-day.
Manager Bowers curtly told Marcus
Mayer, Patti's business manager, that
if he was not satisfied with the accom
modations the whole party could get
out.
The order was hurled at Mr. Mayer,
who is an ofd-time friend of Manager
Bowers' mother, a Baltimore actress,
and was vigorously resented by him.
Twelve rooms had been engaged for
the Pattl party, but on their arrival
it was found that most of the rooms
had- been rented to delegates of the
National Livestock Association now in
session here. The Baroness and Baron
and madame's two companions were
accommodated. Then it was learned
by Mme. Pattl that, her two friends
were compelled to occupy the same
,rocmn and be greatly inconvenienced in
many ways. She vigorously protested
to Mr. Mayer, who went to Bowers with
the complaint. .
The hotel man was not in the best
of temper. Hot words were exchanged,
and Mayer threatened to clean up the
office floor with Bowers.
"If you don't like what I give you in
the way of accommodations, Patti and
her whole party - can get out," said*
Bowers.
Baron Cederstrom and Mr. Mayer
were both for going to the private car
at once, for hotel accommodation was
not to be had. But Mme. Patti did
not wish to do this, as the car Is too
crowded to dress in conveniently and
was in a remote district of .the city.
So they were compelled to remain at
the Portland uhtll after dinner this
evening. .- >. Â¦â¢-. ' . . <
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The assertion Is made that, this six
months' clause has already been vio
lated and that it will be impossible now
for the call to be Issued six months
before the national convention, as the
convention will meet on June 21.
It 'is believed here that a sub-com
mittee of the national committee is
looking up precedents which will per
mit the national committee to issue a
call providing that all delegates in each
State shall be elected at the State con
vention instead of the delegates at
large being elected at the State con
vention and district delegates being
selected by Congressional districts.
The aim of the Republicans who are
now opposing President Roosevelt in
the absence of having any candidate
to run against him Is to have as many
delegates as possible uninstructed.
That is what Senator Hanna's friends
in Ohio have been working for, and the
TIME LIMIT HAS EXPIRED.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 a STREET. N.
W.,; WASHINGTON. Jan. 14.â That In
teresting question: "Will Hanna fish or
cut bait?" has'been quite overshadowed
here to-day by the discussion of the
delay in the issuance of the call for
the Republican National Convention
and Senator Hanna's purpose In per
mitting the delay.
It ia believed here the delay Is due
to a contemplated new departure In
the manner of electing delegates, which
may have a very Important bearing on
President Roosevelt's future and the
control of the national convention. The
national committee. In. its call, defines
the manner in which delegates shall be
elected and the time when primaries
and conventions shall be held. Usually
delegates at large are directed to be
chosen In the manner of State official"*
and two delegates from each Congres
sional district are elected in the man
ner in which Representatives in Con
gress are placed in nomination. It Is
one of the rules of the Republican na
tional committee, that the call shall be
issued six . month's in advance of the
holding of the convention and that the
last delegate shall be elected forty days
prior to the assembling of the conven
tion. â¢ .
news came from Indiana to-day that
prominent Republicans in the Hoosier
State would seek to have its delegates
uninstructed.
It Is surmised that the anti-Rooss
velt Republicans might be able to con
trol the State conventions in Ohio, Illi
nois and Indiana and send all dele
gates without instj-uctions. whereas it
would be almost impossible to prevent
Instructions in any very large number
of Congressional districts.
WOULD STIR UP OPPOSITION.
If tfie national committee should is
sue a call providing for the election
of all delegates by State conventions
it would be opposed by the friends of
President Roosevelt with great vigor,
but the chairman o{ the national com
mittee is the court of last resort, and
it Is doubtful if their protests would
do much good.
Senator Hanna's friends say he Is
being much maligned and that whpn
all the facts" are known it will have
been discovered- that he has been act-
Ing for the best interests of the Repub
lican party. A Senatorial friend of
Hanna said to-day that he believed
Senator Hanna's only reason for with
holding the call was that he, in com
mon with other patriotic RepubHcans,
wished to be thoroughly convinced that
Mr. Roosevelt was the atrongest can
didate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Patti's Visit to Port
land Causes a
' Tempest.
One of the most Important pieces of
evidence in the possession of the po
lice, which has been kept absolutely
secret by them, even to the point of
denial, was found -in ' Soeder's trunk
last Tuesday afternoon. The police
learned that before going to ; Germany
Soeder had left a trunk at the home
The police now give credence to the
theory- that if Blaise had any money
when he left his home in Germany
he turned his funds over to Soeder to
take care of and disburse. Blaise could
not speak English, he was not familiar
with* American coinage, and it is now
thought that when the \ pockets of
Blaise were turned inside out by his
murderer it was done for the purpose
of making the crime look like one with
robbery as its motive.
Miss Annie Meiers, the young woman
who .met Soeder and Blaise on the
steamer La Touraine when they were
coming from Germany, when ques
tioned yesterday as to whether Blaise
had a watch, jewelry or money in his
possession since the. time she met him
up to the. day 'of his last visit to her
uncle's place at 4803 Mission street,
said: "I never noticed whether Blaise
had a watch. I do not think that he
did, for I never saw it. Neither did
he have any Jewelry that he wore. I
do not know how much money he had,
or whether he had any, never, having
been in a position to ascertain this."
In the rest df the conversation Mis?
Meiers'. merely told .of the .frequent
visits of Blaise and Soeder to her un
cle's home and of Soeder's appearing
twice at their house on the day the
dead man's body was found. She was
unable to give anything new that would
be of interest to the police in the gath
ering of. evidence against Soeder.
FIXD POISON IX TRUNK.
At the Mexican restaurant, 721' Broad
way, where Soeder and Blaise always
had dinner, the proprietor and the at
taches state positively that Soeder paid
for the meals and that Blaise was never
see'n to display any money.
A RUSE OF THE MURDERER.
THOUGHT BLAISE PENNILESS.
"I have been at home for the last
three weeks, painting and papering
rooms, and had a good opportunity of
observing the two men. I remarked
to my wife one day that I did not be
lieve that Blaise had a single cent
and that he seemed dependent on Soe
der for his living. Blaise did not, as
far as I saw, have a watch or any.
Jewelry. The first time Soeder ever
said anything to me about Blaise hav
ing money was last Monday morning,
when he reported to my wife and my
self that Blaise had been away all
night. He told us that Blaise had $90
in his pocket the previous night."
Another significant point on which
Soeder is flatly contradicted Is his
statement made last Monday morning
to his landlord, Niblaus, that he feared
harm had come to Blaise, who he as
serted had considerable money on his
person when he went out, as alleged,
on the Sunday evening.
Mr. and Mrs. Niblaus stated yester
day that they had never seen Blaise
display a single penny, and that all
bills were paid by Soeder.
"When Soeder and Blaise came to our
house." said Niblaus, "Soeder paid for
the room. The rent was $3 50 each
week. The second week Soeder came
to me and said he was short of money
and could not pay the rent, and I told
him not to worry but to take his time.
Soeder paid for everything that they
used. If they had some beer, or cheese,
or cakes, Soeder always took money
from his pocket and gave it to Blaise
and sent him to the corner grocery. I
felt sure that Blaise did not have any
money, for some days when Soeder
would remain away all day Blaise
would stay in the room and eat up any
provisions they had on hand.
"I always fill the lamps in the house
every morning," said MrÂ§. Niblaus.
"The lamp in the room which Soeder
and Blaise occupied was used but very
little last Sunday evening. I filled the
lamp on Sunday morning, and if Soe
der was in his room, as he claims, all
Sunday evening the bulk of the oil
must have been burned. When I at
tended to the lamp on Monday morn
ing I found it was nearly filled with
oil and I could only po-ur a small quan
tity Into it.
"I am positively certain that no one
was in Soeder's room last Sunday night
when my husband and myself retired.
Our' sleeping room v is next to the one
occupied by Soeder and Blaise. We
heard no sound in their room and there
was no sign of a light."
IiAMP WAS BUT LITTLE USED.
of giving him chloroform'."-
Soeder claims that he arrived at his
room on Jackson street about half-past
6 last Sunday evening and that Blaise
went out for a walk about fifteen min
utes later, and that he (Soeder) re
mained in the room until Monday
morning.
Against this statement of Soeder's is
the positive assertion of the proprietor
and employes of the Mexican restau
rant at 721 Broadway that, Soeder and
Blaise did not leave the restaurant un
til 7:30 p. m.
Not alone Is Soeder contradicted in
his statement that pe returned to his
room at 5:30 last Sunday evening, but
proof was forthcoming yesterday to
show that he did not spend the evening
in h!s lodgings.
Mrs. J. Niblaus, landlady at 827 Jack
eon street, stated yesterday that not
only is she positive thr Soeder was not
in his own room when she retired last
Sunday night at 10:30, but that she had
proof on Monday morning that^ the
room could have been used but for
a short time on Sunday night last.
"To chloroform a person, that person
has to be cognizant of the fact that he
is being given an anesthetic, or be in
such a condition as to not know that
he is b*fng placed under the influence
of a drug. If Blaise was in such a con
dition, what would have' Leen the use
not b" evo that the man was given
any drug, and if he was it must have
been a hypnotic of especially slow "ac
tion. '_he man could not have been
given chloral or knockout drops at his
meal because the drug would have
rendered him unconscious before he
could have reached the lonely spot on
the side of Russian Hill. The way to
the cut in the hill where the dead body
was found is so steep that it would
have been utterly impossible to have
dragged an unconscious man to the
place where Blaise was found mur
dered.
The writ was served on Chief Witt
man last evening and he will produce
Soeder in court as ordered. The state
ment was made last night by the po
lice that before Soeder is brought into
court this afternoon a charge of mur
der will be placed against him.
The detectives working on the case
visited Soeder's room yesterday and
conveyed all his property and that of
Blaise to the Hall of Justice, including
two large butcher knives and a meat
saw, which Soeder had used in his oc
cupation as a cook.
Strange to say, the officers left be
hind them a dark blue overcoat, the
property of Soeder. A careful exam
ination of this overcoat made last even
ing showed that it was slightly specked
with red soil,. similar to that which is
tor be foundjat th^foot of Russian Hill,
where Blaise was; murdered.
The statement of ..Miss Catherine
Flatley that Soeder desired to marry
her and recently informed her that he
expected to receive $7000 from Germany,
which was published exclusively^n The
Call yesterday, is regarded by uie po
lice as another important link in the
chain of evidence against the. suspect
ed man. Chief Wittman was so im
pressed by the statement made to him
last Wednesday by Miss Flatley that
he instructed the detectives working on
the case to thoroughly interview her
and secure further information, at the
same time binding her to secrecy.
The attorneys for Soeder, Salomon
& Campbell, yesterday applied for . a
writ of habeas corpus from Judge Car r
roll Cook, who informed them that his
calendar would not permit of a hearing
for a few days. The attorneys then
went to Presiding Judge Kerrigan, who
issued the writ on behalf of Soeder,
making it returnable before Judge
Frank Dunne at 2 o'clock this after
noon.
SEEK HABEAS 'CORPUS WRIT.
of Miss GeralBineFlatley, 300 Marshall
street.
Three days before Blaise was mur
dered, Soeder went with an expressman
named Carter to Miss Flatley's home.
He asked for and was given the trunk
and conveyed it to the Five Mile House
at 4280 Mission â¢ street, kept - by Michael
Risso. Soeder told Risso that he de
sired to leave the. trunk and might call
for it in three or four days. If he did
not call for the trunk, Soeder informed
Ripso that, he- might -destroy it.
-On Tuesday last the trunk was
traced and located by the detectives
and was taken to the Hall of Justice,
where it was opened. In it the de
tectives were startled to find two bot
tles of hydrocyanic acid. There was
nothing in the trunk but an old pair
of shoes. Hydrocyanic acid is the
most deadly poison known to science.
When it is considered that one drop
of Â¦ hydrocyanic acid is an instantly
fatal dose, the possession of the deadly
poison in a large quantity by Soeder is
looked upon by the police as the most
Important evidence so far obtained by
them. Soeder also had a bottle of
chloroform and one of carbolic acid in
his room on Jackson street. They nvere
found there Monday last by Detective
Gibson./'

Congress enacts legislation removing
the export duty on Manila hemp
shipped from the Philippines to coun
tries other than the United States

vailing duty on hemp products import
ed from this country.

and made representations to him re
specting the export duty levied In the

an unjust discrimination in favor of

Acting Secretary, of State Loomls, al
though the protests of Great Britain,
Germany and Italy date back to 1902.

ASK REMOVAL
OF THE DUTY
The .Cromarthyshire comes from New
castle, Australia, and brings 2200 tons
of coal for a Portland concern. A year
ago to-day Congress suspended for
twelve months the .duty on coal, the
tariff again becoming effective to-night
at midnight. As a result the owners of
the Cromarthyshire's cargo will lose 67
cents duty on every ton in her hold, an
item of $1541. One of the consignees
was here to-day and tried to-night to
get a tug to go out after the ship, but
because of the unfavorable conditions
none would accept the risk.
The Cromarthyshire is the ship that
collided with and sunk the French liner
La Bourgoyne off the coast of New
foundland several years ago and which
caused the loss of nearly 1000 persons.
The ship was afterward wrecked off the
coast of Africa, but her owners sent
out to Africa and had the ship re
paired.
ASTORIA, Or., Jan. 14.â A British
ship, supposed to be the Cromarthy
shlre, arrived off the mouth of the river
at noon to-day, but was unable to get
into port on account of the weather.
Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua

Ing to the Colon's officers, but in

a warning of what might happen if

and referred their grievances to ar
bitration or forgot them.
It was reported the day before the
Colon sailed that 6000 Colombian sol
diers were within a day's march from
Darian and many miners from that
place had come into Panama fearing
an outbreak at the mines.
The Concord, Marblehead and H.
M. S. Amphion were at Panama and
the Boston and "Wyoming at San
Miguel. The British war vessel
Thearwater sailed from Corinto De
cember 27 for Panama. The Colon
met the cruiser New York off Port
Angel January 4 and on January 5,
north of Acapulco, encountered the
Bennington, Preble and Paul Jones.
The" Colon carried fifty cases of
Remington rifles, with bayonets at
tached, to Salvador for Government
use.
The officers of the steamship Colon,
which arrived yesterday from Pana
ma, say that the isthmian port is al
ready taking on a new appearance
and in a modest way enjoying the ex
citement of a boom. Houses are being
painted, ancient rookeries torn down
to make way for new buildings and
rents have been quadrupled, with a
prospect of rising as the canal nego
tiations progress. Panama is prepar
ing for a rush. The junta is consid
ering the issuance of Panama cur
rency on the same basis as in Peru.
The Government of the new republic
will probably be located at Culebra.

The London Times to-day prints a
dispatch from its Shanghai correspond
ent announcing that there was a con
tinued deadlock in connection with the
affairs of the Hankow-Canton Railroad.
The Belgians are pressing for exclusive
control of^he northern section and it
has even been suggested that, the en
tire American Interests should be
bought out. The shareholders appar
ently are agreeable to this proposition,
but China declines to sanction any
modification of the contract which
would permit such a solution.
It was announced from Brussels on
December 29 that the United States
and Belgian interests in the Hankow-
Canton Railroad had signed an agree
ment by which these Interests were to
be separated and the railroad divided
into two sections, the -Belgians to con
trol the northern section and the
Americans the southern section. The
board of directors was to be composed
of Belgians and Americans in equal
portions.
The bill, it is explained, is not de
signed to interfere with existing pen
sion legislation, and it provides that no
BOldler or widow receiving a pension
under its provisions shall be entitled
to a pension under any other law.

and who has attained the age of 62
years. A like pension will be given
to the widows of such soldiers in all
cases where the marriage took place
before June Z~. 1S90.
ThÂ« introduction of the bill is the
result of the meeting in Washington
of the committee on pensions of the
Grand Army. The committee had an
extended conference with the President
durir.p the day, and the latter assured
it of his entire sympathy in Its under
taking. The Grand Army men also
talked with Pension Commissioner
Ware.
It is asserted by several Senators
who are supporting the nomination of
Brigadier General Leonard Wood to- be
major general that the opposition is
not due to any antagonism of Colonel
Mills, but is a movement consistent
with opposition from Senators to tha
confirmation of General Wood.
The committee passed Mills' nomina
tion with a brief reference, and it is
said it will not be taken up again un
til the contest over Wood's nomination
shall have been settled in the Senats.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â The nom

to maintain peace in the Far East."
These words the Czar spoke to the
members of the diplomatic corps at
the New Year's reception held in the
Winter Palace at noon to-day.
The Czar made a leisurely round of
the great white hall, witn its beautiful
colonnades, in which the representa
tives of the various countries had as
sembled. He chatted freely with every
body.
Keen curiosity was exhibited through
out the room when the Czar approached
Kurino. the Japanese Minister to Rus
sia. The conversation between the
Czar and the Minister was cordial and
fxtended. The Czar emphasized the
high value which he placed upon the
good and neighborly relations between
Japan and Russia, not only now. but
in th? future, and expressed his un
shaken hone that a mutually sat'.s
factory settlement of the difficulties be
tween the two countries would be ar
ranged.
It having become known that Count
Casslni had been^instructed to assure
the United States that Russia wouid
not Interpose objections to the com
mercial treaty between China and the
United States or impede American
rights or interests in Manchuria, the
Czar referred to these instructions in
a lengthy conversation with Embas
sador McCormick and laid much stress
on his desire that Russia and the
United States should live on the terms
of intimate and cordial friendship
which had existed for so many years
and which he especially wished to
maintain. He emphatically disclaimed
the slightest inclination to hinder the
development of American commerce.
Embassador McCormJck inquired con
cerning the Czarina and learned that
her recovery was proceeding and that
no concern was felt regardfng her con
dition.

forms the press that the Japanese re

as Japan was concerned.
An imperial ukase, issued on the oc

Constantine Pobiedonostzeff, chief

ferring on him the insignia of the
Order of St. Andrew. M. Muravieff,
the Minister of Justice, also has re
ceived an expression of the Czar's
special appreciation of his services.
PEKIXG. Jan. 14.â The Gazette to
day contains an edict appointing Wu
Ting Fang, the former Chinese Min
ister at Washington, junior vice pres
ident of the Foreign Office.
The expectation of war is greatly
increased in diplomatic circles here.
The German Minister now regards
â¢war as a probability, although not de
spairing of a settlement at the elev
enth hour. Heretofore he had re
garded war as only a possibility. One
legation has received a dispatch from
Tokio saying that Foreign j Minister
Komura on January 11 represented
tc the diplomats that he expected
peace to be maintained.
The appointment of Wu Ting Fang
to be junior vice president of the For
eign Office was the result of an audi
ence to ivhich the Dowager Empress
to-day summoned Wu Ting Fang.
They discussed foreign affairs and
particularly the prospects of war. The
Dowager Empress asked for Wu Ting
Fang's views on China's best policy.
The appointment will please most of
the other nations, as it enables them
to deal with a diplomat trained in for
eign methods, speaking English and
able to grasp the questions presented
to him. "Wu Ting Fang, who has had
an exceedingly gloomy view of the
Government's weakness since his* re
turn to Peking, now has a position in
which he dan exert influence for re
form, although rank and age gener
ally outweigh ability in the Chinese

WU TING FANG PROMOTED.
The Russian press, 'generally speak
ing, is preserving silence regarding the
Chinese-American trea|y, and efforts
to elicit an official view have proved
unsuccessful. The Xovoe Vremya, re
ferring to the* Far Eastern situation,
declares Russia will not accept Japan's
challenge till all peaceable expedients
are exhausted, adding:
"If war comes Europe should under
stand that it will mark the beginning
of a great struggle between Christian
ity and heathenism, the results of
which will be felt in all corners of the
earth."
The Russ advocates the sale to
asalnst war, declaring war would not
afford a solution of the problem and
that a continuation of Russia's present
policy means the creation of an east
ern strategic frontier, requiring the
same constant protection as the west
ern frontier.
The Russ advocate s the sale to
China of the railway from Harbin to
Port Arthur. The paper has treated
this suggestion with, great considera
tion, without hitherto taking a posi
tive stand. It is no exaggeration to
eay that the extreme view 'finds *ap

educated public of Russia.

that the negotiations are likely to ex

pointed out that in three weeks* tima

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
; ALAMEDA. Jan. 11â Dr. Weston O.
I Smith, president of the Board of
j Health, has .filed his resignation with
j the City Clerk, to take effect imme
j diately upon the appointment of his
j successor by the City Trustees. Dr.
] Smith has been a member of the san
! itary body of the municipality for nine,
j years, several of which he served as
! the head of the board. He was elected
i to the preFidency when that position
J was vacated by the late .Dr. CÂ». H. Lub
j bock, four years aso.
In his letter of withdraw.- ' Dr. Smith
I gives no reason for his retirement from
| the Board of Health, but it is under-,
â¢ stood .that the demands on his time:
I from uther affairs prompted him to re- i
j sign. Dr. W. A. Brocke is mentioned as
I a candidate for appointment to a mem
! bership on the Board of Health that'
| will be vacant when Dr. Smith retires. \
Dr. A. A. Stafford will probably be ;
! chosen president of the sanitary ofli
1 eials. Besides Dr. Smith the other ;
j members of the board are Dr. A. A. j
| Stafford. Dr. W. B. Stephens. Dr. Ivate
j P. Van Orden and David Hjenny.
The boy had gone into the basement
with a lighted lamp to fill a can from
the larger receptacle. While drawing
off the fluid Herman, held the lamp so
near the running oil that the oil be
came ignited. An explosion followed
and the boy was drenched from head
to -feet in the naming fluid.
His screams brought assistance and
the blaze was smothered, but'not until
the victim had been seriously burned.
But the parents did not consider that
the injuries were other than such as
would yield to home remedies, and a
physician was not called until to-day,
when* the boy's condition became
alarming. Dr. J. A. Beckwith was
summoned, but found the little patient
suffering from a shock that .was be
yond the reach of medical relief. â¢.
Coroner Mehrmann took charge of
the case and he will .hold an inquest to
morrow at the Kauffmann home.
Herman Kauffmann, 10 years old and
son of J. A. C. Kauffmann, died.at 2:30
o'clock this afternoon from burns, re
sulting from an explosion last night of
a tank of coal oil at his home, Central
avenue, near the San Leandro road.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
lflS Broadway, Jan. 14.
The fact that the beat of any police officer
shows that the streets Included In It are be
fouled with refuse matter will bÂ« dÂ»emed suf
ficient cause for dropping such officer from th-j
force. Respectfully,
WARREX OLNET. Mayor.
They must arrest violators of the law In
all casfe. There must be no favoritism shown,
and you Â¦will see that any man or woman, no
matter who it I?, that helps to befoul our
streets by throwing dirt, rubbish, vegetables
or other articles thereon is arrested and prose
cuted.
S. C. Hodgklns, Chief ot Policeâ Dear Sir:
The police force of the city is not giving suf
ficient assistance in enforcing the law against
throwing: rubbish into the streets. You are
requested to notify the entire body of police
officers that they must co-operate with the
Street Department in keeping the streets c!ean.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Jan. 11.
Mayor Warren Olney has served no
tice on Chief of Police Hodgkins that
the Police Department will be expected
to strictly enforce the ordinances of
the City which require citizens to desist
from littering the streets and side
walks with rubbish and refuse.
In an official Communication . to the
Chief of Police to-day the Mayor not
only emphasizes this demand, but de
clares that the Police Department has
not been rendering sufficient co-opera
tion with the Street Department in the
crusade for clean streets. Likewise
does his Honor announce that dismis
sal from the police force will be the
penalty of any patrolman whose beat
is found to be in an unclean condition.
The Mayor's letter on the subject is
in the following language:
Notwithstanding the "cinches," how
ever, the number of students will be
nearly rui large as last year, the de
ficiency being made up by new stu
dents. The number of graduate stu
dents registering is 52 regular and lim
ited 1720, specials 151, making a total
of 1933. The number last year was
1947, 14 more than this year. There will
be at least 400 late registrations.
The number of incoming freshmen
will be 40, with 9 others as specials,
besides 11 specials' applications to bÂ«
acted upon.
Latest advices from the. Recorders
office at the University of California
shf^w that 244 students have met intei
lectual death at the hands of the facul
ty '"fire department." with the list of
dead and wounded still growing.. In
other words, 24* students have beea
"cinched" out off" college, barred from
returning to thei"r* studies, ruthlessly
set aside by one stroke of the pen of
the recorder, guided by the "faculty
firemen." Not only this, but 163 morÂ«
students withdrew without even at
tempting the examinations that sle>v
tn*ir fellows, so that the total number
of casualties will foot up 41^.
This Is an unprecedented number of
students to be "cinched." There have
be'en many "cinched" In year3 gone by.
but this record overlaps them all. It
is all due to the good old "'weedlng
out'* process adopted by the faculty,
uhich is based on the theory that ths
laggards must go. Most of the suffer
ers are 'freshmen, who could not pass
the examinations in mathematics.
These examinations are always made
unpleasantly hard, and if a freshman
can pass them he Is considered a
pretty good candidate for the rest of
his college days. If he does not pass.
the faculty considers that it has got
rid of a student who would have beea
dead material and a drag for the resc
of the time.

SPOKANE, Wash., Jan. 14.â The
disease commonly known as "lumpy

Early last spring Chase \ bathed
in a pool .which prairie cattle fre
quented. .Some of the cattle were
known : to have had .the disease.
Chase; soon became sick and while be
ing spared some of the symptoms of
actinomycocis, as the disease is known
Jn the medical books, he suffered as
animals do, gradually wasting away
to a skeleton. Physicians to-day pro
nounced death due to "lumpy jaw."
Chase was 20 years of age and unmar
ried. - .
..The disease has frequently been com
municated to human beings' according
to medical records, but it by no means
is common. It is a progressive affec
tion caused by the presence of actino
mycetes,' a variety of ray-fungus, and
usually is confined to cattle and swine.

BOSTON. Jan. 14.â Tests of subma

the steamer James S. Whitney during
a trip from New York to Boston. Com

was established with three lightships
while the steamer was some distance
from them, apparently showing it is
possible for vessels to signal each other
and so avoid collisions. This after
noon as the steamer approached the
Pollock Rip lightship the distinct
sound of a tolling was heard in the
telephone receiver stationed in the
pilot house. A few minutes later an
other bell was heard, which the officers
said was submerged at the Pollock Rip
shoals lightship. At this time signals
â¢were distinctly heard from both the
Pollock Rip and the Pollock Rip shoals
lightships, -but as the Whitney passed
one on the starboard and the other
on the port side it was impossible to
distinguish clearly from which light
ship individual sounds were received.
To-night as the Whitney neared Bos
ton harbor the sound of a bell was
heard clearly in the telephone receiver
in the pilot house. The captain veered
the course of the steamer at intervals
so that the sound of the bell was heard
both from the port and starboard sides.

As a result of a visit of inspection
to several schools by School Directors
Roncovierl and Walsh the Board of
Education will establish new classes in
the Pacific Heights, Crocker, Dudley
Stone and probably the Hearst
schools.
The two directors found that the
classes in each of the schools were
filled with pupils, and they agreed to
recommend to their colleagues that
two additional classes be formed in
the Pacific Heights, one class in the
Crocker and one in the Dudley Stone
in order to accommodate the. over
flowing attendance.
The conditions at the Hearst School
were found to be a little more favor
able, and it. was decided that another
class would be established In the
Hearst which now has nineteen
classes occupied only in case there is
a still greater, increase in the attend
ance.

On being asked why he voted for Mr.
Levy to displace Mr. Emery he said it
was for the best interests of the de
partment.
Â¦ "Do you know any of the men for
whom you voted?" was asked.
"No," was the reply.
"Don't you think as a point of pru
dence you should have informed your
sBFf^m Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦ ...-â¢Â¦â¢
"Well, all doctors look alike to me,"
was the smiling retort.
The witness then tacitly admitted
that he had voted blindly for the men
and had never even looked at the
charter. He had heard of such a thing
as civil service, but had never read the
rules of the commission. His first In
troduction to his appointees was when
he read the resolution which he after
ward Introduced.
"Why is it that the same sanitary
Inspection which under civil service
cost $6000 will now cost $10,200; is that

When the legislative, executive, and
judicial bill was reported by the com
mittee to the House, separate votes
were demanded on amendments which
struck out provisions for the expenses
of the Civil Service Commission and
Inc'reusing.the salary of the Governors
and secretaries of New Mexico and
Arizona,, and reducing the salary of
the directon of th\Â» census. All other
amendments were adopted without di
vision. Delegates Rodey of New Mex
ico and "Wilson of Arizona made ap
peals for the -increase of salaries for
the r Territorial' officials/ while Hemen
way. said that the . committee had
brought in a bill free from increases
and he hoped -none would be made.
An amendment to the bilj was
adopted restricting the use of Govern
ment horses and carriages to the Pres
ident, his secretary and Cabinet of

The House to-day, by a vote of 172
to "88, refused to sustain the action
of the committee of the whole, which
yesterday adopted an amendment
striking out the paragraph providing
for the salaries and expenses- of the
Civil Service Commission, thus restor

the salaries of Territorial officers in

VOTES FOR STRANGERS.
The witness did not care to answer,
but Mr. Ruef informed him that there
was no objection to an answer, and he
replied that Mr. Ruef had given him
them. The answer was received with
an outburst of laughter, in which even
Mr. Ruef joined. I
Further Dr. HughesÂ«stated that he
knew nothing of the men deposed or
to be appointed and had made no study
of the needs of the department, but
considered that the changes would be
Questioned by Mr. Brandensteln. the
witness admitted that he knew of no
reason why the positions were abol
ished.
"Where did you first see the resolu
tions?" Brandensteln asked.
"In the Mayor's office." was the re
ply. V
"Who gave them to you?"
Hughes promptly took the advice and
said he wns unable to answer. When
pressed strongly, he said that' were he
to find that the duties of the sanitary
inspector and district health officer
were Identical he would be willing to
rescind the action taken at the last
meeting of the Board of Health. He
thought, however, that the range of
duties of the health officer would be
wider than that of sanitary Inspector.
TAKES RUEF'S ADVICE.
Abraham Ruef was present and when
a pertinent question was asked regard
ing the difference between the duties of
the district health officer and the san
itary inspectors, advised that no an
swer be given.
As no one wished to ask further
questions of Dr. Ward he was excused
and Dr. Hughes called to the stand.
In answer to questions by Supervisor
D'Ancona. Dr. Hughes said the depu
ty health officer was to fill the position's
of statistician, bookkeeper, stenogra
pher and secretary. He knew nothing
of any provisions of the charter re
quiring appointees to be selected from
the civil service list and had never con
ferred with his colleanue.
The Joint committee of the Super
visors on Health and Finance met
again last nie?ht to continue the inves
tigation Into the alleged violations of
the civil service law by the Board of
Health. The Inquiry developed the fact
that none of the members so far exam
ined knew anything regarding either
the old or new appointees until the
board organized.
Braunhart interjected a few ques
tions and elicited the Information that
Stlnson practically knew nothing of the
duties of the position of statistician,
had never been in the statistician's of
fice and did not know where it was
located. With Dr. Ward he had care
fully investigated the merits of the men
who were going out and those who
would come in, but could give no In
formation regarding the nature of the
investigations without referring to his
list.
Dr. Pohelm testified that he had
never received any instructions as to
his duties and had never seen the reso
lutions regarding appointments until
they were given him In the Mayor's
office last Saturday.
The investigation will be resumed at
8 o'clock to-night; .
Rraunhart at this point asked the
witness directly why he had abolished
certain offices on the ground of econ
omy and recreated them under other
names. Ruef objected to the question
and the witness finally gave the same
answer he had repeated a score of times
to various questions: "To increase the
efficiency of the department." In fact
this was his stock answer, taking the
place of the customary "I don't know"
with reluctant witnesses.
On examination by Judge Slack the
witness said he had examined the char
ter In a desultory way and was satis
fled that no violation was belng'made.
The new men, he said, were more
efficient than the former employes, al
though many of them he did not know
personally.
Dr. Stlnson said that while he -had
been a member of the board for a year,
he was always frozen out of the secret
meetings and knew nothing of what
was going on. With Dr. Ward, Dr.
Stlnson had gone carefully over the
proposed changes and .was satisfied
that no violations of the charter were
being made.
Brandenstein questioned the witness
as to secret sessions of the board and
what inquiry he had made regarding
the qualifications of the men dismissed.
Dr. Stlnson resorted to evasive answers.
He and Dr. Ward, he pre
pared the list of dismissals and appoint
ments, .but could not remember in
what manner or for what reason -the
choices were made. None of the names
were submitted by Schmltz or Ruef.
The Mayor, however, had made, sug
gestions regarding names but had made
no demands.
On the advice at Ruef the witness
refused to tell what names the Mayor
had suggested. The resolutions were
drafted by Ward and Stlnson with
Ruef's assistance, but the information
as to just what assistance Ruef had
given was very vague. â¢
MATTER OF EFFICIENCY.
Deputy Health Officer Levy then took
the stand and was asked regarding his
duties. He told how he had been In
structed regarding his duties by the
president of the board. He said that
the duties are very simple and could
easily be carried out by any person
of average Intelligence. The secretary
job he described as the easiest part
of the whole business. Questioned by
Judge Slack, he admitted that state
ments he had made regarding the ab
sence of Secretary Emery and others
from the office were based merely on
hearsay.
Dr. Stlnson was next called. He was
satisfied that the offices of bookkeeper,
stenographer, secretary and assistant
could be satisfactorily filled by one
man. but that Levy, the appointee,
could fill it better than a man on the
civil service list. Like Dr. Hughes, he
seemed to know nothing of the* duties
of sanitary Inspectors.
A FLING AT OLD BOARD.
At this point Brandensteln poured a
little hot shot into Ruef. Ruef had
contradicted a statement of the chair
and Brandensteln objected, saying that
it was not. a court of justice and It
looked ill for a person there by cour
tesy of the committee to contradict the
chair.
On redlrect-examlnatlon, In answer
to a- question as to why he found # it
necessary when consolidating the of
fices to go outside the civil service list,
the witness said that, It being a new
position, he did not consider the civil
service.
Ruef's questions were of a leading
nature and as a rule were answered by
a simple "Yes." Dr. Hughes was cer
tain that Deputy Health Officer Levy
could easily do the work of the five
men he had. displaced.
FORGOT CIVIL SERVICE.
in thÂ« Interest of economy?" was
asked.
Before the witness could answer he
was stopped by Ruef, who said all
would be brought out in the cross-ex
amination.
On cross-examination by Ruef Dr.
Hughes said he never had conferred
with any of his fellow members'ex
cept as to rules of the City and County
Hospital.
The following were appointed on the
staff of .visiting physicians at the City
Hospital:

You Are Certain to IjOsc If You At-

You cannot force your stomach to do
work that it fs unaMe and unwilling to
do. It has b?m tried time and again,
xvlth always the same result. The stom-
ach if a sond and faithful servant, but
when jiush<Â»d beyond tho limit it rebels.
pome stomachs will Ftand much more
abuse than Othera, but every stomach
has its limit, ?nd when that limit is
fetched It is a vÂ«Â»ry dangerous and un-
vise proofvdlng Â«o attempt to force tt
" into doing further work. The sensible
and reasonable coarse is to employ a
substitute to carry on the work of di-
B~estlon and k'iv<* the stomach an op-
portunity to recuprrate and regain its
loFt strength.
Stuart's Dyypcpsia Tablets are the
only rerfwi substitute to takÂ»Â» up and
carry on the- work of tirod. worn-out
stomachs. They are natural and easy
in thrir work and CftQM no disturbance
In the digestive organs. They contain
alt the essential elements that make up
' the castne Juice and other digestive
fluid*, and will direst any food that a
rtropR. healthy stomach will, and do it
In the *am* time and in the same way.
They work independently of sÂ»urround-
lnc conditions, and the fact that the
Â¦tcmach i!Â« weak or diseased does not
Influence thf m at all in their useful and
effective work. Thcv will digest food
just as well in a glass Jar or bottle as
thfy will in a stomach. You can seÂ«
that for yourself by putting one of
them into a jer with a square meal and
eome water to enable it to work.
Stuart's Dgrspt&sla Tablets by thus
relieving the stomach of Its work enable
that organ to rest and recuperate and
regain Its hralth and rtrength. The
process is perfectly natural And plain.
Nature will heal the stomach Just as

JURV SAYS TIIK MAN
PIED IN" THE FLAMES
SALT LAKE. Utah, Jan. 14.â The
Deseret News to-night says that it is
seml-officially stated that the reason
for the recent hasty visit to New York
of Vice President W. ,H. Bancroft of
the Oregon Short Line Railroad is the
making of final arrangements for turn-
Ing, over a portion of thttfcnain line of
the Union. Paeific, runnVg between
Ogden arid Green River, Wyo., to the
Oregon Short Line and its future ope
ration as a part of that road. It is
stated that the new order will go into
effect either the first or fifteenth, of
February. The Union Pacific. trackage
in question is 177 miles long.
plans to construct from coast to coastâ
the Grand Trunk Pacific. President
Burt will neither affirm nor. deny the
rumor. Railroad men say that plans
were completed some time ago for
Burt, after his return from Europe
next winter, to take charge of the new
Hays road, on which construction is
expected to commence in â¢ the spring.
It will be' remembered that -Hays had
the same trouble with E. H. Harriman
that Burt has had.- When Hays tired
of the autocratic rule of Harriman he
went back to_ the Grand Trunk.
Friends of President Burt point out
that he Is in his prime: as a railroad
executive and that the new trunk line
will require just the experience that he
can give.

OMAHA, Nebr.. Jan. 14.â Information
has been received from New York that
William H. Bancroft has been chosen
general manager of the Union Pacific,
but that the appointment will not be
officially announced until to-morrow. A
meeting of the executive committee
was held in New York this morning.
The appointment will not affect the
state of Bancroft as vice president and
general manager of the Oregon Short
L\jie. Bancroft will make Omaha his
headquarters and will spend "a portion
of his time in Salt Lake, which is his
home.
"It will be only a short time before
the information comes officially," said
he, "that Mr. Hill and Mr. Harriman
have reached a working agreement.
Railroad men well informed look to the
merger of the Hill and Harriman inter
ests as the next great move in the poli
tics of railroading. Events have been
shaping themselves to that end for
months. The election of Harriman to
the directory of the Erie, a Hill line,
and the recent financiering that gave
Harriman control of. that road are con
vincing proof that an alliance, between
these two giants of the railroad world
is pending."
Keen interest is being taken here in
the serni-offlcial information that Pres
ident Horace C. Burt of the Union Pa
cific Railroad will next year be chief
executive of the new railroad. Hays'
tion. The summoning of General Man
ager J. F. Wallace of the Illinois Cen

managers ara to be consulted.
The information that Hill and Har
riman are endeavoring to get together
comes from an official who could not
afford to talk, if it were not his tenure
of offices comes to â¢ an end with the
Burt regime. On his authority it is
said that the merger for operating ad
vantages has been contemplated for
some time. â¢

XEW FIRE ORDINANCE
READY TO BE PASSED
CHICAGO, Jan. 14.â From action
taken to-niÂ£ht by the City Council at
a special meeting it is evident that
Chicago theaters will ncrt be able to
reopen for some time. The meeting of
the Council was for the purpose of con
sidering the revision of the building
ordinances. When the measure was
called up Alderman Maver moved that
consideration be deferred; that all the
proposed amendments be published, and
that the whole subject be taken -up
when the Council was conversant with
the proposed changes. Alderman Fore
man seconded the motion, declaring
that some of the changes were of a
character that reauired extensive In
vestigation and that it was not proper
for the Council to pass on fifty provi
sions at a Fingle sitting. The motion
Â¦was passed, and all consideration of
the new ordinances was postponed "un
til the Council is ready."
As soon as the Coroner's jury re
leases its control of the Iroquois Thea
ter the playhouse will be again given
over to the flames if plans evolved
by Mayor Harrison and Walter L.
Fisher of the City Club arc carried out.
Kxperts who will fight over again the
Iroquois conflagration will have trained
firefighters at their elbows to see that
the demonstration of the plans does
not bring about any property loss out
side the partly ruined playhouse. The
purpose of again firing the theater is
to test the sufficiency of city ordinances,
present and prospective.
Jerry Simpson expressed himself
strongly in favor of the leasing of pub
lic lands, and urged that something be
done to protect the public reserves from
being gobbled up by speculators by
means of the- lieu land law.
A 'new executive committee was
chosen,- which includes* the following
members: E. S. Fosney, Flagstaff,
Ariz.; H. A. Jastro, Bakersfleld, Cal.;
M.-fB. Gwynne, Boise City, Idaho; John
Sparks, Reno, Nev.; Solomon Luna,
Los Lunas, N. M.; Jesse M. Smith, Lay
ton. Utah; . E. F. Benson, Tacoma,
Wash., and Eben P. Low, Honolulu,
Hawaii:
Professor Gifford Pinchott gave the
convention some of his views on forest
reserves and B. B. Brooks of Wyoming
advocated State control of reserves and
the issuance of grazing permits 'by the
States.
Governor Ileber M. Wells of Utah
was introduced and delivered an ad
dress on the topic of "The Policy of
Government Relative to the Forest Re
serves."
F. H. Newell, chief hydrographer of
the Geological Survey, addressed the
convention in behalf of the commission
appointed by President Roosevelt to
investigate the conditions "existing rel
ative to public lands. Mr. Newell ad
mitted that the time had come when
something must be done relative to this
matter.
J. E. Stubbs of Nevada delivered an
address on the subject "What Shall
We Do With Our Grazing Lands?" He
advocated the improvement of grazing
lands by the observance of regulations
made to protect the interests of the cat
tleman, sheepman and the farmer.
The speaker was in favor of the open
ing of the Government reserves for use
by stockmen. The development of the
arid lands he particularly advocated.
OPENING OF -RESERVES.
Mr. Springer, on the opening of the
afternoon session to-day, stated that
what the stockmen- wanted and must
Have, If the railroad companies con
tinue to withhold passes, is an elective
railroad commission. The railroads do
not want that system, he said, because
they know what it means, as they have
seen what has been accomplished
thereby. . - ââ¢ Zfi
"If the railroads insist on opposing
us," he said, "we will appoint an elect
ive committee in every State west of
the Mississippi River. We have had to
spend money to learn a few things, but
we have learned them. We have learned
that we have power and can use it."
To-morrow the attention of the con
vention will be given to the election of
officers for the ensuing year and the
selection of a place to hold the next
convention. The executive committee
will report the nominations for officers
at the morning session. F. J. Hagen
barth of Idaho is the only one talked
of as a successor to President Springer,
and his election is considered certain.
The general impression is that there
will be no change in the list of other
officers, the incumbents to be re
elected.
There is little doubt that Denver will
be the next place of meeting. San
Jose, Cal., and El Paso, Tex., have
been making a fight for the conven
tion, but It is thought a. compromise
is to be made whereby the next con
vention will go to Denver, that of 1905
to El Paso and the succeeding meetings
to Denver as permanent headquarters.
The business sessions of the seventh
annual convention will come to a close
with the selection of the place of meet
ing.
To-day the subject of railroads and
forest reserves were considered In rela
tion to their effect upon the livestock
industry. Shortage of cars, slow time
in transit and high tariffs formed the
burden of a number, of addresses bear
ing upon the first mentioned subject.
That legislation might be had remedy-
Ing the exclusion of stockmen from
the forest reserves was the demand of
every speaker on the public land sub
ject. - '
OFFICERS TO BE NAMED.
PORTLAND, Ore.. Jap. 14.â By unan
imous vote and with great show of en
thusiasm, the National Livestock Con
vention to-day adopted resolutions
heartily indorsing the policy of-Pres
ident Roosevelt with reference to build
ing the Panama Canal.
When President Springer introduced
the resolutions he alluded to the dis
cussion of the Panama question in the
United States Senate and the criticism
of President Roosevelt on account of
the position he has taken. The call for
a vote was the signal for a roar of
"ayes" and a burst' of deafening ap
plause. Not a dissenting voice was
raised. A" copy of the resolution was
immediately wired the President.

WE hope that every reader* of The Call has read
Mr. Sbarboro's article on California manufac
tures. We have 'long lingered on the edge,
just at the door of manufacturing development. High
priced coal has made power too costly to compete with
cheap fuel. In some lines we have found an offset to
this in our clement climate, which permits more con
stant operation and therefore a greater output, but in
the main the fuel handicap has been a serious drawback.
Now our ample store of fuel oil is lifting this bar to
progress in manufacturing. k '
One thing needfuHs a domestic iron production. The
Clipper Gap iron mine, which proved to be a large
pocket of exceedingly fine iron, was the last effort at
iron prodviction in California. Smelting with charcoal
soon used up all the wood available in that part of
Placer County and the industry ceased. But there is
fine iron ore in great quantity in forty of our counties.
It is associated with limestone for flux, and" we need
only smelting fuel to immediately add iron to our list
of valuable products. This is a matter of so much im
portance as to justify every effort to apply oil to smelt
ing. If the flames of oil can be evenly distributed in a
furnace cupola, the problem will be solved.
On the Atlantic side the centers of iron production
are remote from the seacoast. Rail transportation *to
tidewater is -severely felt by the iron industry, so that
Mr. Carnegie once proposed to build his own railroad
to a seaport to Svoid the burden. In California there
are vast iron ledges within eighteen miles of the coast,
and not far away are oil wells. Such articles as Mr!
Sbarboro's should stimulate inventive enterprise to ap
ply oil to ir^ori 1 development. . * . 'Â¦â¢Â¦:^J??JÂ§

THE town of Corvallisâ the t name means "Heart of
the Valley" â in Oregon has been infested by a
new religious sect called "The Holy Rollers/' Its
vicissitudes are greater than its age. Its members are
moved to destroy such vanities as their fur
niture and clothing, and to make burnt offerings of their
cats and dogs. The leaders have been legally admon
ished without effect, and their followers have become a
pronounced public nuisance.
No matter how extravagant it may be. any new reli
gious fanaticism will get followers.. The mystic and
mysterious, and miraculous appeal to men, in spite of all

Jemima" Wilkinson and Mother Ann in their day. found
followers in the hard-headed State of New York, so the
Holy Rollers find in the Webfoot State of Oregon. It
is useless to say that persecution of these people will
probably increase their influence, for such people re
gard the enforcement of the Jaw as persecution and
make no difference between that and lawless attempts
to restrain their follies.
They have recently become so aggressive and so
many weak-minded people have been led to injure them
selves by destroying their property under the influence
of delusion that the people of Corvallis took the law, ac
companied,by tar and feathers; into their own hands, and
capturing two of the leaders in the shank of the even
ing, marched them into the woods and gave them a
neat suit of tar and feathers. At midnight some of their
followers applied at a drug store for turpentine and oil
and otlrer detergents7 to undress . them of their novel
clothing. At 8 o'clock next morning one of the feathered
and tarred appeared in a buggy with a young and holy
and handsome Roller and .drove to' a magistrate's house,
where they were duly married. '
Talk of an active life, what can beat that? Holy roil

Scraped off at midnight and married next morning.
We have to advise the people of Corvallis who do not
Holy Roll to let the Rollers alone.. Let them roll in
peace, for folks capable of cheerfully^ enduring such a
variety of experiences in'so short a time will make more
converts the more they are interfered with. If let alone,
they. may roll themselves out. But they are seen to
thrive if they can plead persecution.'
There is very little doubt that in the Eastern situation
the sympathies of France are emphatically with Russia
and that there exists between them some understanding
by which the Czar is successfully playing for delay. The
sentimentalists who are inclined to go into raptures
over this exhibition of friendship should not forget that
it is dictated solely by commercialism.' National sym
pathies are measured in the weight of gold.
AN ACTIVE PLACE.
Reports from New York carry the startling informa
tion that Russell. Sage is gradually retiring from active

first authentic instance on record that the old man of

the prospect of a dollar gained.

that is done the money will be 'In

Horse Enjoys Revenge.
Tom, one of the team of horses used
by the Police Department for patrol
wagon service, is a wise inimal. Hour
after hour every day he stands near
the City Hall awaiting a summons to
rush to the aid of some person in n<&d
of medical attention or to bring to the
prison some malefactor. His waits are
not tedious ones, for his idle time is
spent in munching cubes of sugar his
driver and other attaches of the prison
and hospital always have for him.
Some time ago he took particular
delight in showing: his dislike for a
City Hall janitor who, whenever he
passed ttie horse, hit him a resounding
slap on the back. Tom tried time and
time again to kick his tormentor, but
his harness prevented him. Then the
janitor commenced making peace over
tures. He brought the horse sugar and
occasionally a carrot, but the animal
refused to take them from the stick
on which the janitor held them out to
him. Then he tried other tempting
morsels, but still Tom was cbdurate
and refused to make up. Then he ap
parently relented, and one morniifg
greeted the janitor with a whinny of
pleasure. Emboldened, the janitor of
fered the horse a lump of sugar on
his hand. Tom accepted the lump of su
gar. He also took the janitor's hand
and save it a squeeze between his
strong teeth that caused the janitor
to yell with pain. Then Tom whinnied
again, this time with a great display
of pleasure.
The Homicidal Hatpin.
Death lurks in the hatpin. The (Eng
lish) Medical Press thus comments up
on its murderous propensities and the
means by which a modern state may
protect itself against them:
"Feminine fancy has ordained that
the skewer-like hatpin is an essential
element of cephalic attire, and must
be retained. It is an instrument with
potential energy for endles3 damage.
Numerous accidents, some of which
have proved fatal, have resulted from
a persistence in the practice of hat
fixing by this convenient but dangerou3
article. A return to attachment by
elastic may not ajouse esthetic en
thusiasm, but certainly it is time, the
wit of womankind was turned to the
inventing of gome means by. which the
offending hatpin was robbed of ltd
homicidal tendencies or the refractory
hat might be retained by safety pins or
othtr guileless means. Unless woman
: will look to this matter mere man will
have to intervene, if only in his own
interests and a3 a means of self-protec
tion. Possibly the plan of licensing
might be followed with advantage.
Just as a man may not carry a re
volver without a license, so a woman
may not carry that hardiy less deadly
weapon, a hatpin, without a yearly
license purchased from the state." *

Undoubtedly "housekeeping" is an
art, and a very' fine art, too. In every
community you may see it brought to
its highest perfection. There are cer

them homes) where a- spider would die
of fright and a fly would commit sui
cide Irom the very weight of solitude.
You can see your face in panels of the
doors and eat your meals on the hard
wood staircase. A lace curtain that
should hang awry would blush turkey
red. and a chair left out of place would
walk solemnly back to where it be

Now, there can be no doi.bt thr.t a

there does seem to be a moral antag

To do either all alone requires only an
average woman consecrated to her
task. To accomplish both requires an
abnormal genius. And so, we say. give

Rebuilding a Railroad.
By CAM. D. BEURY,
Former Fai'.roa.J Editor New York Time? anj
New York Pun
iCopyrislit, ISKM, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
. E. H. Harriman said a few days ago
that, not less than $100,000,000 would
be required to complete the work of
reconstruction planned between Ogden
and San Francisco along the Union
Pacific and the Southern Pacific lines.
Part of this work has already been
done, and not the least important feat- j
ure of the completed improvements on '
this transcontinental system is thej
thirty-mile viaduct across Great Salt
Lake, known as the Lutin cut-off.
Civil engineers say that this bridging
cf the northern end of Salt Lake is one
of the most extraordinary feats of con
structive engineering known. It cost
about $5,000,000. Mr. Harriman pro
poses to surpass this feat by tunneling
thÂ«? Sierra Nevada Mountains at a cost
of bet ween $10,000,000 and $20,000,000.
Practically all of the millions needed
to carry out the plans for reconstruct-
In? the Union Pacific and Southern Pa
cific railroads have been provided for
by liberal drafts on current income and
the authorized issue of new securities.
The ease and promptness with which
these of millions have been
raised is in marked contrast with the
eleven years' struggle of Asa Whitney
to get Congress to appropriate $.WjO to
make the first survey for a transcon
tinental railroad. The great work now
being done by Mr. Harriman and his
associate? with such liberality and
cHerity is hardly suggestive of the pub
lic apathy, the tragedy and the ro
mance of the pioneer days.
Asa Whitney was a New York mer
chant, who. while in China prior to
1S"5,. became strongly convinced of the
vaf=t commercial advantages to be de
rived from railroad communication be
tween the Pacific Coast and the pros
perous American cities on the Atlantic
seaboard. He collected statistics show-
Ing the character and extent of the
trade of China, Japan and India, and
forthwith bictured to himself and his
friends the Aladdin-like wealth within
the reach of his fellow countrymen.
Returning to New York sbout 1840, Mr.
Whitney began an energetic campaign
in favor of a transcontinental railroad.
His id?a at that time was to obtain a
grant of land from the Government
along a route from Lake Superior to
Puget Sound, <and start the construc
tion of the railroad with funds sub
scribed for the stock of a Pacific Coast
Railway Company. It took four years
of persistent effort to obtain a hearing
before Congress, and even then the
enthusiastic merchant was snubbed and
laughed at. In 1S4S the House Commit
tee on Pacific Lands reported in favor
of building a railroad to the Pacific
Coast, but took no definite steps in that
direction. Seven years later an appro
priation of $5000 was made for a pre
liminary survey. During the eleven
years that it had taken Asa Whitney
to accomplish this small result he had
sacrificed a large proportion of his own
fortune in disseminating information
and enlisting the co-operation of other
men. His health broke down and he
did not live to enjoy the practical re
alization of his dream.
The seed had been planted in pro- '
ductive soil, however, and the project i
grew â very slowly at first, but stead- i
lly and hardily. One by one able men !
of commanding influence* took the i
matter up, and finally a <tardy public i
sentiment demanded the building of j
a railroad from the Mississippi River
to the Pacific Coast General William j
Teeumseh Sherman says In his mem- !
oirs: â¢â¢Shortly after returning from j
Monterey I was sent by General Smith J
up to Sacramento City to instruct I
Lieutenants Warner and Williamson \
of the engineers (U. .Â«. A.) to push i
their surveys to the Sierra Nevada \
Mountains for the purpose of ascer- i
taining the possibility of passing that j
range by a railroad, a subject that I
then â¢ elicited universal interest. It
Â¦was generally assumed that such a
road could not be made along any of j
the immigrant roads then in use, and '
"Warner's orders were to look farther j
north up the^ Feather River or some)
of its tributaries. Warner was en-!
gaged in this survey during the sum
mer and fall of 1849. and explored to
the very end of Goose Lake, the
eourcÂ« of Feather River." General
Sherman remarked that it was impos
sible to ascertain who was the first
to suggest the construction of a rail
road to the Pacific Coast. The fact
is recorded that as far back as 1834
I>r. Samuel Boncraft Barlow. wrote in
favor of building' a railroad from New
York to the mouth of Columbia Riv-'
er. This idea subsequently developed
into the Northern Pacific Railroad
project-
Between 1850 and I860 the con
stantly increasing: number of advo
cates of a railroad to the Pacific Coast
divided into rival factions and schemes
for obtaining the Congressional aid
multiplied. One enterprising New
York and Boston showman undertook
to raise the money for building the
desired transcontinental line by or
ganizing a gigantic lottery.' Another
proposition was for the 'Federal Gov
ernment to establish a popular sub
scription bureau and issue stock re
ceipts for each subscription, however
small. The discovery of gold in Cal
ifornia increased the Congressional
support of the railroad project an3

The library of Charles II of England
contributes a manuscript entitled "The
Statutes and Ordinances of the Most
Noble Order of St. George Named the
Garter, Reformed, Explained. Declared
and Renewed by Prince Henry VDB-*
The volume dates from about 1571. It
was bound by Samuel Merne for
Charles II. and bears as a cipher the
interlaced "CC." On the first page are
the arms of the Duke of Hamilton, in
gold and water colors, and the official
MS. order for the Issuance of the war
rant for John Werden to be a Baronet
is laid in.
THE January number of the North American Re
view is the vehicle for the expression for some,
convictions upon the lynching question by the well
known. Southern novelist. Thomas Nelson . Page. The
author reviews the grewsome record of the administra
tion of lynch law for the last eighteen years, notes the
growing roster of deaths by violence at the hands of
mobs in the Northern States, and demonstrates the part
played by race prejudice in these oft recurring exhibi
tions of lawlessness. Then he 'arrives at his suggestion
fpr the eradication of the hateful evil, , admitting, how
ever, that his scheme is somewhat Utopian.
"Until the negroes shall create among themselves,"
says Page, "a sound public opinion "which, instead of
fostering, shall reprobate and sternly repress the crime
of assaulting women and children, the crime will never
be extirpated, and until this crime is stopped the crime
of lynching will never be extirpated. Lynching will
never be done away with . while the sympathy of the
whites is with the lynchcrs. When the negroes shall
stop -applying all their energies to hartoring and defend
ing negroes, no matter what their crime so it be against
the whites, and shalrÂ»distinguish between the law-abiding
negro and the law-breaker, a long step will have been
taken*."
Nobody can gainsay that the lynching evil is largely
due to race hatred and that some of the heinous crimes
for which negroes are made to suffer by the mob are
prompted in a large measure by a retaliatory spirit on
the part of the blacks. Nor can the truth of Mr. Page's
assertion that black helps black even in crime be doubted.
It is true that mob spirit will tend to assert itself as long
as the shocking crimes of the Brutish class of blacks con
tinue to be perpetrated, but the Southern novelist's pro
posed remedy for the extirpation of the causes which*
prompt one half of tjie lynchihgs in. the South has little
of practical worth. â¢
There is but one-way that lynching can be ended; that
is to enforce the law. The scheme of laying liable to
damages the community wherein a lynching has taken
place has ben tried and proven a failure. The sugges
tion of a drum-head court-martial for cases of emer-.
gen'cy is without the spirit" of the laws. It does remain
within the province of magistrates,- however, to put a
check to the endless chain of procrastinating measures
Avhich are in the ready wits of sharp lawyers when
fighting in the last ditch. When the mob feels reason
ably sure that in the right channels and under the right
procedure justice will be done it will be more ready to
stay the hand of lawlessness.
PROPOSED REMEDY FOR LYNCHING.
Several worthy gentlemen in this city discussed ear
nestly the other day the final condition of the unsaved.
One fact may be accepted as established. The final con
dition* of the unsaved is as nothing compared to the ner
vous horror of the poor office-holder who worked for the
losing candidate and is now trying to prove to the
powers that be that he didn't.
THE reports from Chicago show an extraordinary
state of affairs. The Iroquois Theater fire demon
strated that/the first duty of government in a great
city, the safety of its people, had not been, considered
among the functions of the officials. The awful calamity
turned the whole attention of the city to this neglect.
The officers were compelled to look into conditions and
do their duty, though too late to save lite. Not only was
it found that no theater nor hall in the city had obeyed
the law intended to secure safety, but'it was found that
failure to do .so had been purchased very cheaply by the
owners of such places.
When public attention was centered upon the city
government it extended beyond the cause that roused it.
For years the press had humdrummed about abuses and
failures of government, extending from a typhoid water
supply to public vice, insufficient police protection, filthy
streets, epidemic burglary, highway robbery and mur
der. Just at that point Governor , Beckham of Kentucky,
in his annual message to the Legislature, replied to some
Chicago criticisms of his State by declaring that even
Breathitt County, the land of the mountain feudists, is
a safer place to live than "Chicago. Immediately a citi
zens' league for the suppression of crime was formed
with ex-Comptroller Eckels at its head, and thereupon the
city government put its hands in its own pockets and
began to govern.
It was discovered that manj- of the great office build
ings are deficient in construction, through the neglect
or corruption of the Building Department. It was also
found out that a certain lawyer had the key to that de
partment, and persons desiring to build consulted him
professionally, to see that they were not undulyjan
noyed f>y the department in".. stfch trifling matters as
sufficiency of foundation, fire-proofing, elevator shafts
and fire escapes. His fee secured the desired immunity.
On the other hand, builders. who needed no go-between
with the department, for they obeyed the law, were held
up. annoyed and made losers, even to the extent of offi
cial incitement of strikes among their workmen. Ever
since the collapse of the street railroad strike, the street
cars had been made unsafe by murderous attacks on
conductors and. gripmen. and the cars had been,ob
structed by truck drivers blocking the lines maliciously.
Thousands of citizens had suffered loss and inconveni
ence as a result, missing trains and business t appoint
ments, and being, exposed to personal danger besides. .
Now the aroused and enraged public .opinion of the
city has changed all this. Buildings imperfectly con
structed by official immunity are - being overhauled.
The police are no longer allowed to loaf, to wink at
crime, or look the other way while it is- committed. All
truck drivers who maliciously block street cars are
jerked from their seats and n taken to jail. The lawyer
who became almost a millionaire by going between
builders and the Building Department is not going any
more. It is reported that even an effort is being made to
remove the veneer of from the streets, and
there is a fair prospect that Chicago may have at last
the appearance of a government for come time to come.
But, after all, it is pitiful that this awakening should
have depended upon such an awful sacrifice of human
life and upon such appalling human suffering as were
required to remind the people that they have been elect
ing public officers not to properly govern the city, but to
use the power of their positions to prey upon the people.
Other cities may make a note of what is happening
there, and the people may decide for themselves whether
a government of go-betweens, of graft and nepotism is
to be endured until the way to reform is lighted by the
burning bodies of the victims of mfsgovernment.
Unsanitary.

triple extract of rage. N He is seeking
the gore of a coterie of promising
young artists and there is likely to be
a sudden death in the circles of bohe
mia soon if he is not put under re
straint. The story is this.
Down in one of the old rookeries on
the lower end of Montgomery street,
which are the nesting places of the
poor artist and the poorer newspaper
man, there lived until recently a
young artist whose name is high in
the ranks of the art lovers. His stu
dio was one of the coziest in that
drear desert of telegraph wires and
tar roofs which is the province of the
penniless 'searcher after fame. Con
sequently all of the other craftsmen
and a few of the favored literary as
pirants used to foregather in this
cheery oasis and drive dull care away.
Their entertainments usually broke up
with the advent of the morning's milk
wagons.
The German musician lived directly
below this studio and, being of no
temper for conviviality and of an age
"when the beauty sleep was precious,
he grew more and more wrathy over
the evening festivals. At last he went
to the proprietor of the building and
declared that the building was given
over to a lot of young hoodlums who
knew not the laws of right living.
The proprietor felt in duty bound to
convey news -of the German's protest
to the artist.
The next day when the music teach
er was absent from his rooms the
artist and a trusty henchman tiptoed
down to his door and went through
some mysterious auctions. They in
serted a tiny glass pump into a bottle
of liquid and then applying it to the
keyhole of the German's door, they
injected *a tiny stream into the room
beyond. Then they went out to the
City Hall and complained that the
room of their neighbor was of a
shockingly unsanitary character, a
terrible menace to health.
The health inspector was sent to at
tend to the matter. The minute he
began climbing the stairs to the Ger
man's room he was assailed by one of
the most fearful and wonderful
smells known to chemistry. The in
spector did not know that it was mer
captan and when the German re
turned he found a notice from the
Health Department pinned upon his
door.

The war rtself brought the Govern
ment to a realizing sense of the ab
solute necessity of a railroad, to the
Pacific. Aside from the fact that the
.entire. Pacific Coast territory of the
United States was exposed â practic
ally undefended â to hostile attack, it
was soon ascertained that the Govern
ment was obliged to spend $7,000,000
annually for the carrying of troops,
supplies and mails between the Mis
sissippi River and the Pacific Ocean.
Congress granted a charter for the
Union Pacific Railroad in 1862, and in
1864 amended this charter, giving
more liberal terms to capitalists and
doubling trie land grant. Even then
private capital held aloof from the
enterprise, and General \V. T." Sher
man urged that the Government build
the road. President Lincoln, who was
anxious to have the road built, told
General Sherman that the Federal
Government had its hands full and
could not think of embarking in the
business 'of railroad construction.

a thrifty population of skilled labor, increase our ex

with us the increment of wealth, which we now send
abroad for "what we will then produce at home.

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMESNat ale Andreotti. financial secretary
of the Fishermen's Mutual Aid Society,
was arrested yesterday on a warrant
charging him with felony embezzle
ment. The complaining witness is Jo
seph Calegaris, president of the so
ciety, who alleges that Andreotti is
short in his accounts to the extent of
$296. A demand for an accounting was
made upon him on December 21, but
he . has failed to make the shortage

Accused of Being a Defaulter.
Vera Costello resented the attentions
which Mabel Wells was bestowing on
the only man she had' ever loved. When
she met Mabel at the eerie hour of 5
o'clock yesterday morning on Kearny
street, between Jackson and Washing
ton, she , put her protest into the form
of skewering her hated rival y t with a
hatpin. Yesterday Miss -Costeilo was
before Judge Mogan to answer to the
charge of assault with a deadly weap

Policeman Nelson, whose eagle *eye

David Gaffney was booked at^the
City Prison yesterday by Detectives
O'Dea and Mulcahy on a charge of
burglary. He is accused of having
broken into the grocery of Julius Levin,
Bay City Market, on Christmas day
and stealing four cases of whisky, two
cases of eggs and two hams. He was
caught by one of the partners, but
broke away from him and escaped. The
stolen property was recovered by the
detectives. Levin told them that his
store had been systematically robbed
for the last two years. Gaffney was
employed in the market.
Booked for Burglary.
"Most all of the difficulties that come
before me among men are the result
of Quarrels over women, children or
dogs. In the case of women it is hope
less to try to adjust matters. As re
gards dogs the question is altogether
too delicate for discussion except in
specific cases, but with children I would
suggest that some of Â¦ the excess en
ergy wasted in battery cases , be ap->
plied to the young ones."
Under the Judge's advice, the two
neighbors shook hands and promised
hereafter to settle the differences be
tween their children by a more peace
ful method than fighting among them
selves.
Judge Cabaniss wrestled with a bat
tery case yesterday. S. Riccomi runs
a fruit stand at 4063 Eighteenth street.
One of his neighbors is George Pol
lock and both of them are fathers of
children. The youngsters became in
volved in trouble and, the elders took
up the auarrel. As a result Riccomi
landed a large, fast punch on his
neighbor's nose. Judge Cabaniss phil
osophized over the questicm in this fash

The prisoners appeared before Judge
Fritz yesterday. Prosecutor Ike Har
ris was clearly up against it. There
was no proof that this game of the
Greeks was a percentage one, and in
the absence of this it was necessary
to dismiss the defendants. Harris went
back to Homer and hummed hexame
ters from the Iliad to the court in
support of his contention that the game
was an unlawful one, but Homer and
the statutes of the State of California
are divergent. Nobody was willing to
testify that the Greeks were taking
any more percentage than they have
always done throughout history, so
they were allowed to go free and take
their places with slot machines and
other immunes.
Twenty-seven Greeks, wise in the
knowledge that the mountains look on
Marathon and Marathon looks on the
sea, but totally unversed in a law pro
hibiting gambling in the city and coun
ty of San Francisco, were gathered in
by Sergeant Ward and four other po
lice officers Wednesday night on the
charge c-f playing a percentage game.
The game was being conducted in" a
saloon at 7S5 Folsom street. On the
table was more than $3000, and all of
the prisoners had wads of greenbacks
in their clothes. â¢
Wolf bases hrs petition on several
grounds. He claims first that the pro
ceedings of the board were illegal be
cause no charges against him had been
preferred with the Civil Service Board
and because the last named board did
not authc-rizc the Police Board to en
ter into any investigation, as the char
ter requires: second, that the Police
Commissioners were not qualified to
try him because they had become pre
judiced by reason of ; their frequent
consultations with Chief Wittman in
regard to the charges against him, and
third, that he was not given a fair
hearing because Commissioner Drink
house had conferred with George B.
Simpson, saloon-keeper whose
money he was accused of taking.
Former Sergeant of Police Reuben A.
Â¦Wolf, who was dismissed from the po
lice force for accepting money from
saloon-keepers, took his case into court
yesterday in the hope of securing res
toration. He filed a petition for a writ
of review of the proceedings before the
Board of Police Commissioners which
resulted in his dismissal. Judge Ker
rigan assigned the case to Judge Sea
v.ell, who issued an order directing the
Commissioners to appear before him
January- 22, at 10 a. m., to show cause
why Wolfs petition should not be
granted.

to Man Who Was In-
A gentleman from Georgia named
Ed Brown was ordered into custody
by Judge Fritz yesterday afternoon be
cause the Judge thought he was not
telline the truth in regard to certain
occurrences he witnessed in connection
with a charge against George Curry for
making an assault With a deadly weap
on on Gus Lindenstadt. Both Curry
and Brown are street car men and the
latter was trying so hard to shield the
defendant that Judge Fritz became
properly indignant.
"There is entirely too much lying go-
Ing on in; the Police Courts," .said the
Judge, "and I shall do whatever I can
to stop it." Late In the evening he
had a conference with District Attor
ney Bylngton and a charge of perjury
was preferred against Brown, with his
bail set at $2000.
William H. Atkins .was held by Judge
Mogan yesterday without bail on the
charge of murder. .He shot and killed
Muldoon McDonald on Christmas day.
McDonald was a negro prizefighter,
somewhat amusing in the ring, but de
cidedly uninteresting outside of it. His
passing will not be vigorously regretted
by the colored colony, among whom he
was rated as a "bully" and a thief.
Atkins killed the fighter on Christmas
day because he had stolen $1 65 from'
a poker game in which he had no in
terest. The defendant pursued and
shot the robber. Self-defense will be
the plea.
Caroline Better conducts a little no
tion store out on Xinth avenue, between
M and X streets. She was before Judge
Fritz yesterday on the* charge of selling
liquor without a license. A recently
appointed policeman named Burg in
vaded the notion store Tuesday morn
ing In civilian clothes and asked the
Â»ld lady for a drink. She refused to
jell it to him, but offered to give him
a nip, because the fog was chill and
she really believed he needed it. Then
he laid down some money in payment
and afterward arrested her for selling
llcuor without a license. Judge Fritz
listened to her simple story and dis
missed her without a word of censure.
It was plain she had not atte'ixipted to
violate the law and it was only her
charity that had drawn her into the
trouble. In Chicago and elsewhere po
licemen that try to lure people to com
mit crimes have received severe repri
mands from. Judges.
Seek to Prevent Cruelty.
W. T. Harmon was fined $5 . by
Judge Cabaniss yesterday for driving
a horse unfit for use. The case of Wil
liam Churchman, another driver ac
cused of cruefty to his horse, was
continued by Judge Cabaniss until
Saturday. Officers Unger and McCur
rie of the.; Jiumane Society killed a
glandered horse at the docks yester
day. The animal was to be sent to
Petalumato be used for chicken feed.
Gets No Damages.
Alec Fries had his hand injured by
a saw in the factory of the American
Lead Pencil Company about two years
ago and immediately brought a suit
for damages against his employers.
The lower court decided-that the com
pany should compensate the 'young
man for his losses, but the Supreme
Court reverses that judgment. The
case was sent back to the Superior
Court yesterday for a new trial.
Convicted of Assault to Rob.
Joseph Davis was convicted by a jury
in Judge Dunne's court yesterday on
a charge of assault to commit rob
bery. He will be sentenced on Janu
ary 23. On the morning of October 4
he led Henry Gohringer into a door
way on Mission street, near Third, and
was going through his pockets, when
Policeman Tillman made his appear

Mrs. Naomi Morgan, who has a lodg
ing-house at 402 Mason street, secured
a warrant from Police Judge Cabaniss
yesterday for the arrest of "W. E. Gates
cm a charge of passing a fictitious
check. She said that Gates had paid
her $3 room rentf and had given her
a check on the Germania Savings Bank
signed "E. J. Berry" for $20, receiving
115 change. When the check was pre
sented at the bank it was found that
no one of the name of E. J. Berry had
an account there.
"Passes Fictitious Check.
Judge Cabaniss was unsparing in
his words of censure on the heartless
woman who put* a baby on a hot stove
for punishment. During the course
of his lecture the mother of the baby,
who is the daughter of the defendant,'
started a "rough house" in the court
room by abusing M. J. White, secre
tary of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. Somewhat
narrowly she escaped a commitment
for contempt of court. Her mother
was ordered into custody and to-day
Judge Cabaniss will impose as severe
a sentence on her as is compatible
with the circumstanc.es. Six months
is the maximum punishment and there
are no mitigating circumstances.
Takin said he went to his room after
testing the stove and was startled by
a series of screams from the baby.
He rushed down to the kitchen and
found Mrs. Fersent holding the child.
He saw the burns on its body and ad
ministered whatever remedies" he
could find in the house.
Victorina Fersent, the grandmother
who sat a baby on a hot stove in her
home at 710 Grafton avenue, was con
victed yesterday by Judge Cabaniss on
the charge of cruelty to a minor child.
In addition to herself she had as a
witness for the defense a Korean
named A. Takin, who claims to be a
minister of the gospel. He has been
living in the Grafton avenue home for
several months. On the day the baby
was burned he testified that he laid
his hand on the stove and that it was
not exceptionally warm. The defend
ant al3O grave testimony of similar
character.
Maude Laurence, charged with tho
forgery of the name of J. W. Lay
mance to a check for $100, was on
hearing before Judge Cabaniss yester
day. Her defense is that the check
was genuine and the contention was
heavily assisted by the testimony of
Theodore Kylka, the handwriting ex
pert, who said that Laymance's signa
ture to the paper in question was un
doubtedly genuine.
Prosecutor Hanley asked Kytka if
he had examined the alleged spurious
signature under a microscope. "I
wouldn't disgrace a microscope in that
way," said Kytka. "There" Is no neces
sity for such an examination. The
signature on this disputed check could
not have been written except by the
same man who signed the checks which
are admitted to be genuine."
Miss Lawrence bore her usual con
fident air and does not seem to be
much worried over the outcome of the
case. In view of the testimony it looks
as though trouble would never trouble
her on this particular charge.

The defense admitted having mailed
and written the letter, but denied that
it was obscene in the legal sense of the
term as laid down by United States
District Judge <}e Haven in a recent
opinion. In the indelicate epistle Dr.
Fritz recited what purported to be the
history of his relations with his second
wife in the most vulgar Anglo-Saxon
phrase, but Judge Heacock decided
that it did not.come within the prohi
bition of the statute and dismissed the
case.
With Fritz appeared his first wife
and his four children, and as they sat
in a row they occupied one side of the
small courtroom. Fritz was confident,
the divorced Mrs. was smiling
and happy and the little Fritzes snick
ered and giggled at untimely intervals.
His attorney, Bert Schlesinger, confi
dentially informed a f-w friends that
Dr. Fritz and his former wife had be
come recopciled, and that they were
about to be remarried as soon as he
should obtain a divorce from the wom
an to whom he referred in. the letter to
Marshall as "Sandhill Jennie."
Dr. J. A. Fritz, whos: 'roubles

Joseph King, the convict preacher,
was sentenced to serve twenty years
in Folsom penitentiary for burglary in
the first degree. The sentence will run
concurrently with one Imposed upon
King previously. King, Thomas Barker
and Henry Hamilton maintained a
"robbers' roost" at 835B Howard street,
where they kppt the products of bur
glarirs in different lodging-houses.
Hamilton and Barker are both serving
terms of sixteen years. King and Bar
ker have taken appeals to the Supreme
Court.
J. E. Crothers was sentenced to serve
seven years in Folsom on a charge of
forgery. He forged the name of M?>t

for twenty cases of whisky, which he
obtained from a firm on Drumm street
and sold to Kennedy & OKeefe. gro*
cers. Eddy and Pierce streets, for $150.
He had been arrested several times for
similar swindles and there is another
charge of forgery pending against him.
He is 25 years of age and is regarded
as one of the cleverest young crim
inals in the city. Since being â¢ con
fined in the County Jail he has writ
ten to Judge Lawlor in contrite terms,
expressing an intpntion to reform if
given another chance.
Jacob SHverman was sentenced to
Ferve fifteen years in Folsom on a
charge of robbery. He pleaded guilty.
The offense was committed in the
Olympic dance hall at 519 Pacific street
on the night of October S. W. W. Eg
gleston, a miner, had been drinking in
the dance hall and went to a rear
room. He was followed by Silverman,
who placed a loaded revolver against
his abdomen and ordered'him to throw
up his hands. Eggleston complied, but
one of his hands happened to drop and
Silverman, shoving the muzzle of the
revolver into Eggleston"s mouth,
threatened to blow his head off. Sil
verman then relieved Eggleston of his
gold watch and chain and ran from the
dance hall, but was pursued and cap
tured. Silverman is a young man and
the Judge in passing sentence upon him
said that he belonged to a class of
young men who were responsible for
the many desperate robberies that are
committed in this city. He declared
there was need of strong example and
that their comparative youth should
not be permitted to interfere with the
infliction of adequate punishment for
the perpetration of crimes of such
gravity and alarming frequency.
Judge Lawlor passed sentence on
three prisoners yesterday.
Charles Wines, a railroad man from
Oakland, who made the grievous mis
take of changing his name to Wilson,
was on trial before^ Judge Fritz yester
day on the charge' of throwing red pep
per into the eyes of a boy on Mission
street". There was no desire to prose
cute the defendant. The complaining
witness admitted that he had been
bothering Wines in company with a
crowd of other boys. He said he was
not injured by the ' pepper and was
very glad to drop the prosecution.
Judge Fritz was flooded with letters
from prominent Oakland persons tes
tifying to Wines' good character and
he was dismissed with a reprimand.

Dugdale Sells to Const League.
SEATTLE. Jan. 14.â The baseball
war in Seattle was ended to-day when
D. E. Dugdale sold out to the Pacific
Coast League. The price is not made
public. Dugdale refused an offer of
$10,000 for his plant last year in or
der to remain loyal to the league he
had helped to found. Soon afterward
Tacoma quit with a full treasury and
when Dugdale learned that Butte and
Salt Lake did not want to come here
this season if a war was on he con
cluded to protect his own interests.
A favorable proposition was made
him this afternoon and he accepted.
This will leave Lucas free to form 'an
intermountain league that will em
brace Spokane. This will probably
be done at the Spokane meeting on

The blaze started in the hotel, which
was owned by F. W. Smith, and spread
rapidly to adjoining houses. Before the
alarm was sounded ths persons sleep
ing in the upper rooms were aroused
by the crackling flames and the vol
ume of smoke that poured into the
apartments. Instantly a stampede to
the street began. Women hurried out
in scant attire, and the men wasted
no time in sartorial preparation for
exit. Several Jumped from the lower
windows.
The loss is about $10,000. A saloon

The cause of the fire is not known
GRANTS PASS. Ore., Jan 14.â
Flame and smoke enveloped the Del
marte Hotel here at 5 o'clock this
morning and sent the half-clad guests
scurrying to places of safety on the
chill streets. Several men and women
were slightly burned in their rush from
the burning building, and tne of them,
Frank McNamara, was - severely in
jured.
Special Dispatch to The Call
These stories, it Is claimed, had
been told to, old man Slight, which ac
counted for his dislike of his son
Samuel. The court held that the at
torneys might endeavor to prove that
such stories had been told to old man
Slight.
Among the witnesses in the contest
was Dr. F. W. Hatch, superintendent
of the State hospitals. Dr. Hatch tes
tified his belief that while Slight was
on the verge of insanity when he had
the - visions, 'nevertheless he was what
would be regarded as a man of sound
mind.
During: the proceedings it was
charged that the old man's mind had
been poisoned Â«by stories he had been
told concerning his son Samuel. At this
afternoon's session Al D. Briggs, a
prominent down-river farmer, was put
on the stand. When Judg^e Peter J.
Shields asked what it was desired to
prove by Briggs Attorney Robert T.
Devlin said It was intended to show
by the witness that Samuel Slight,
who is trying to break his father's
will, had stolen Brig-gs' wife from him
and had afterward married her. The
witness, was asked if he had not at
one time intrusted his wife to the care
of Sam Slight, with the understanding
that he was to take her to a certain
place, but that he had taken her to
another place and deceived him. This
was objected to and sustained by the
court. Judge Shields said the point
might be brought up in another
form.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 14.â A sensa
tional episode marked* this afternoon's
session of the Superior Court., which
has been engaged for several weeks
in the trial of the contest to break the
will of the late Enos T. Slight, a capi
talist, who was well known through
out the State as a patron of spiritual
ists. The family is well known in
this city, and much interest has been
imparted to the proceedings by the
unusual character of the evidence.
Slight died a short time ago, and It
was found that his will cut off with $1
his son, Samuel Slight, and his grand
daughter, Mrs. Nina Casselman. the
bulk of his property going to other
children and relatives. Mrs. Cassel
man and Slight began a contest,' al
leging that deceased at the time of
making his will under the influence
of spiritualists and that he was gov
erned in all his acts by visions he
claimed to have held.

ROME Jan. 14.â The Vatican au
thorities have been informed that th
appointment of Consignor Serafl-/
Archbishop of Spoleto. as apostolic
delegate to. Mexico, cannot lead to the
resumption of diplomatic relations
between the Holy See and Mexico,
where since the fall of Maximilian
there has existed a complete separa
tion of church and state.
The late Pope Leo made several at
tempts to have the Roman religion
given official recognition In Mexico
but President Diaz constantly and
consistently refused to comply with
Pope Leo's wishes, although not op
posed to Catholicism, which prospers
In Mexico more than It does In any
other Latin-American republic. The
new apostolic delegate to Mexico will
have exactly the same powers and
limitations as that of the apostolic
delegate at Washington.

Man With Many Names Is Taken Into
Custody at the Palace
A man giving his name as G. S.
Seidle, was arrested at the Palace
Hotel yesterday afternoon' by Detect
ives Ryan and Taylor and is being
held by the police, pending an inquiry
Into his past. On January 6 he reg
istered at the Palace as R. M. Ander
son of San Jose. Two days later he
disappeared without paying his bill
and shortly after he had gone it was
reported that the blankets of the .bed
in his room were missing. Two days
ago ho registered again at the Palace
under the name of R. M. Thompson.
About 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon
he entered his room and was prepar
ing to go to bed, when he was taken
into custody bj' the detectives, who
had been looking for a man answering
his description and who is suspected
of having committed several thefts at
different hotels of late.
While waiting for their prisoner to
dress the detectives caught him in the
act of throwing behind his bed a pawn
ticket for an overcoat. The ticket
bore the name of Rudolph. It later
developed that he had been staying at
different hotels under several names
and when 6earched a key to a room in
the Golden West Hotel was found in
his pocket. The prisoner claims to
be a hotel man of Portland. Last
night he was identified as a former
bartender of a hotel in Portland.

SUMMARY.
Anvil, the 3 to 5 favorite for the
third race, was beaten by Galanthus.
Jingler being third. Anvil was played
as if it were all over, but he faltered
at the finish when he appeared to have
the race won.
The second race at three furlongs fur
nished a whipping finish, Airship, the
2 to 5 favorite/winning by a nose from
DeGrammont, with Tim Hurst third.
Favorites won the majority of the
races and the public went home happy.
The Goldflnder was the* first one to go
through, winning the mile and seventy
yard event from Dupont, with Lunar
third. Walsh rode a perfect race on
The Goldfinder,
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 14.â When Sal
lie Goodwin came under the wire first
in the last race there was a cheer from
the thousands of women in the grand
stand and a rush of hundreds of men
to get in line behind the bookmakers'
cashiers. Sallie was the "real good
thing" on to-day's programme and she
went through without a hitch. She
opened at 2% to 1, but there was a
rush at every book and in two minutes
the price was forced down to 7 to 5.
At post time it was 8 to 5. It was la
dies' day at Ascot, and 6000 fair,spec
tators were present. It seemed that at
least half this number had a bet down
on Sallie Goodwin.
The matter of permits is still in abey
ance. The police committee of the
Board of Supervisors took no action in
the matter at their meeting yesterday.
From present appearances there will he
no fight this month. This means that
some club will be shy one exhibition
this year.
Like Flanagan, the railway station
agent who, in reporting a train wreck,
wired: 'â¢Number 6 off again, on again,
jfone again. Flanagan," the Young Cor
bett-Britt fight is on again.
John J. Gleason took a hand at
matchmaking yesterday and soon had
the signatures of the elusive but much
ly 6ought boxers to a contract. They
have agreed to fight in Woodward's
Pavilion on Friday, March 11, for â¬5
per cent of the gross receipts. The
club guarantees that the winner's share
wfll be at least 510.000. The boxers are
each to post $2500 forfeit before 6
o'clock to-day with Eddie Graney, the
referee, guaranteeing their appearance
in the ring ready to fight. The club
will popt a similar amount, which will
be forfeited if it cannot promote the
fight. The complete article of agree

The sudden signing of the men added
another surprise to the long list which
negotiations for tho fight have devel
oped. Late on Wednesday night Young
Corbett and Manager Coffroth camÂ» to
an understanding and the Yosemite
Club manager was told that everything
was satisfactory and to get Britt's sig
nature to a contract. Britt was not to
be found at his usual haunts yester
day and the next development was the
matching of the men by the Hayes
Valley Club.
Alex Greggains feels he has a griev
ance in the matter. He holds the lease
of Woodward's Pavilion with Morris
Levy and the latter retired in his favor
when bids were first opened. Greg
gains also claims he thought Gleason
was acting for him. when he signed the
men.

NOTES OF THE TRACK.
It only goes to show how the smart
est, of people can be fooled. A jockey
by name, Hildebrand, advises Royalty.
The latter steals "away, and when 'too
late the favorite. Frank Woods, dis
covers the treachery. Captain Collier,
the old sleuth, could not save the day
then, for Royalty has been recognized
as the winner by the judges, and the
timers display 2:06^4 for the one and a
quarter miles.
Position, with a bowed tendon: Mar
lin and the rest of the supporting com
pany then gather around the winner
and the curtain falls with all joining
in the chorus of "In the past we played
thee, but thou fooled us."
Other things that happened were the
victories of four favorites, quite a dif
ferent etory to relate 'from the day
before. The attendance was large again
and the bettins brisk.
Myrtle H too-k the opening seven
furlong run at odds of 10 to 1. She
was.well ridden by Oliphant, and catch
ing Tonopah in the promenade home
won by nearly a length. Penance was
third, at 15 to 1.
Those who wasrered on the chances
of Military Man, favorite for the three
year-old number, felt nervous for a
time, but eventually recovered their
self-composure. Garnet Ferguson's colt
was hust!ed too much tne first part of
it and began running backward. He
got into his stride when ti.o stretch
was reached and in a drive beat Young 1
Pepper a head. Hugh McGowan was
third.
GLEXAUVOX NEARLY LANDS.
Colonel "Butch" Fisher's Glenarvon
was the real thlnÂ£ for the seven-furlong
number next decided, and just missed
landing by a nose. Tommy Burns had
the leg up and quickly showed first.
Larsen rode the favorite. Velma Clark,
and after a series of mishaps, got up
in time to get a nose decision. El Pi
loto finished third, a neck before the
100 to 1 shot Homily.
"Peanuts" Hilderbrand rode a first
rate race an Heather Honey, favorite
for the mile selling fixture. He rated
the little niare along well, and taking
the rail position in the stretch beat
out Romanie a length. The latter was
a 20 to 1 shot. Rosarie finished in the
show.
Nothing could stop the "Seattle In
terurban Flier" Ulctma. The little
mare, startins a mild favorite, led
from start to finish in the futurity
sprint following. She was tiring slight
ly at the end, though lasting Ions
enough to down Bard Burn3 half a
length. Show honors went to Pure
Dale.
THE PLOT THICKENS.
Had it not been for the production of
the charming comedietta entitled "How
Royalty Was Received" the Sport at
Oakland yesterday would have been as
devoid of incident as was Adam of silk
underwear on his Wedding tour.
It was produced as an afterpiece with
all the gorgeous stage trappings" of
Parsifal, the scenic effects being by
William Fieldwick; the musical score
by the track band, the situation by
Harry Green of Spokane; the training
by E. Getchell, while the bookmakers
furnished the coin.
The plot was somewhat new, inas
much as the vlllian triumphs over the
people's choice, and then a sympathetic
audience restrains its temper while the
conqueror is declared Innocent by the
judges and returns to his barn fol
lowed by a motley gathering of stable
boys, trainers, touts and ill-dressed
hangers-on of the turf.
Whfle the villagers are placing their
coin that \Frank Woods will be elected.
Royalty, supposed to, have been dead
for several weeks, suddenly returns
from his self-impcfsed exile. He has
quite a following, who eagerly snap up
the 7 and 8 to 1 that the resurrected one
wlllnot make good.
A bountiful luncheon provided by
that most generous patron of field'
trials W. S. Tevis was then enjoyed,
after which preparations were made to
run the second series. A drive was
made to new 'grounds, where C. E.
Worden's English setter dog Harry H,
handled by Coutts. and the same own
ers Jay M. handled by Lucas, were
cast off. They ran forty minutes with
out finding game. Harry H again
proved himself a class dog and ranged
out wide and at great speed, working
long casts to cover. Jay M did not
phow well in comparison with his
brace-mate, although his style, pace
and range were good. The next brace
called were J. E. Terry's English set
ter dog Kilgarif. handled by Coutts,
and W. \V. Van Arsdale's English set
ter dog McCIoud Boy, handled by
Babcock. A bevy had been flushed
from brush alonjr a ditch and after
ranging out well into open territory the
degs were s\vung # back to the birds.
Both dogs commenced making game
and Kilgarif roaded down a draw, do-
As she moved up a trifle at the order
of her handler the bird flushed, she
being steady in every way. This was
her only opportunity on but the
showing made was a sensational one
and stamped her e.s one of the best set
ters in America.
NEW GROUNDS ARE SOUGHT.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 14.â The second
day of the all-age stake proved to be
the most satisfactory of the field trials
meeting, both in regard to point work
and in the class shown by the com
petitors. Owing to the presence of a
heavy land fog which hung over this
section during, the morning hours the
first brace of the day was not put down
untU 11. o'clock.
J. W. Consldine's English setter
Count's Peg, handled by Lucas, and
Stockdale Kennels' pointer dog Cuba
Jr., handled by Dodge, were the dogs
drawn to run and were cast off along
a slough bed skirting a large open field.
A bevy was soon flushed by the spec
tators and some of the birds scattered
in low cover, where Cuba Jr. scored a
good point. In a clump of high weeds
he pointed again and a number of birds
were flushed ahead of him. Both dogs
showed good speed, but the setter out
ranged Cuba Jr. She failed, however,
to establish a point during the heat.
J. E. Terry's English setter, Lady,
ran the sensational race of the all-age
stake. Cast off in an open field she
ranged out in splendid style, going at
a fast clip and never letting up in pace
for a moment during the heat, which
was the best of th^ day. After making
a series of long casts, during which she
hunted out every foot of ground and
moving back before her handler she
stopped to a beautiful point on a single
bird.
BY C. W. HIBBAKD.
ingr a clever piece of work on part of
the bevy, which was running ahead.
The birds finally flushed wild ahead o'f
him, after which he made a point on a
single, which flushed a moment after
he established the point. The dogs were
now taken across the track, when Kil
garif stopped, to a point. He .then ran
over a bird and stopped to a point
on two birds which remained. McCIoud
established a point on a brÂ»re knoll and
a bird could be seen running from him
and finally flushed about twenty-five
yards ahead. Kilgarlf established two
more good points and showed that he
possessed a wonderfully good nose and
ability to handle his bird in an exceed
ingly clever manner.
W. TV. Van Arsdale's English setter
dog Bell Boy, handled by Babcock, and
Stockdale Kennels' pointer Midget, han
dled by Carlyle, were cast off in the
same field and ran twenty minutes.
Bell Boy showed best in speed and
range and both were quike stylish in
their way of going. Midget soon es
tablished a stanch point along the rail
road track . and was steady to- shdt.
She then made several false points.
Bell Boy also made a point from which
no bird could be raised.
CUBA JR. AND LADY *. COMPETE.
The last heat of the day was between
J. E. Terry's Lady and Stockdaje
Kennels' Cuba Jr.^ This proved a high
class competition. Both dogs were suf
fering somewhat from Injuries to 'their
feet, but started fast. Lady was the
widest ranger and made long casts, one
of them being almost a half mile ahead.
She then cast into likely territory and
proved herself a bird finder by locating
a large bevy, which she roaded in
clever style. As the birds ran ahead
Cuba Jr. also worked on the scent of
the birds. Finally she started out in a
beautiful style and a few moments later,
as she cautiously moved forward, the
birds commenced to run again. The
quail finally took flight and quite a
number scattered out in sage and alkaU
weeds. On these Lady was first to
point and Cuba backed in fine style.
She next pointed a bird which ran and
Cuba, which was backing, caught scent
of it and pointed stanchly and was
steady to shot. Cuba then wheeled to
a snappy point and Lady backed in fine
style. He followed thi3 with another
point, which ended the work for the
day.
Considering the conditions under
which the dogs are running some re
markably clever work" 1 has been done
and the class 6f the stakes taken as a
whole is high. Judge Hall has ordered
out five dogs to compete to-morrow if
it is found necessary to run them after
the Lady and Kllgarif heat, which has
been scheduled for to-morrow morning.
Unless a great reversal of 'orm is shown
to-morrow Lady will undoubtedly be
placed first in the stake and Kilgarif
second, with possibly a division of third
place.

r"I don't like all this notoriety." said
he, "but the truth Is there Is an es
trangement between my wife and my
self and if she comes to this city I
will get out, as I did from Phoenix.
She is insanely jealous of my mar
ried daughter by my first wife. My
daughter is living: In Honolulu, and I
suppose that my wife thought that I
might leave- here for the islands. I
have" no such intentions, however. I
came to San Francisco because I had
business matters to attend to here.
Mrs. Colburn and I cannot get alonÂ£
together and I thought it best that I
should keep away from her as much
as possible. If she moves this way I
shall move elsewhere. It is my inten
tion to return to Los Angeles, but not
for several days."
Mrs. Colburn caused considerable ex
citement in Phoenix when she an
nounced the disappearance of her hus
band, who had preceded her there on
business. Sympathy for the woman
prompted the police and the railroad
officials to institute a search for Col
burn. They traced him as far as this
city and then .the wife took up the
hunt.
Colburn's name was found on the
rr gister of the Occidental Hotel, where
he arrived two nights ago. and a few
minutes later the badly wanted guest
put in appearance. "When informed by
the officers detailed to locate him that
his wife was making a search for him,
he showed no deep concern over her
anxiety and replied that there had been
no particular mystery attending his de
parture from Phoenix otner than that
he had hurriedly left that town for the
purpose of avoiding Mrs. Colburn.
Charles P. Colburn. a prominent min
ing man of Los Angeles, .r.-ho. according
to a recent dispatch from Phoenix,
dropped out of sight in that city shortly
after his wife had arrived there from
.California, is In this city, staying at
the Occidental Hotel. Yesterday the
local police received a letter from Col
burn's wife, who is now in Los Ange
les, asking them to make a search for
her husband. She inclosed a photo
graph of Colburn and requested that
a careful watch be kept on the steamers
leaving for Honolulu, for which place,
she wrote, he might embark.

of 430 r>er day. Reduced colonists' . rates will
be In force again during ' the rprlnir months.'
and many who have been unable to arrange
their affaire in the East to come to California
to settle will do so then. All Indications point
to a decided Increase In the number of colonists
destined for California in 1004. There seems to
be a concerted movement from certain sections
of the Middle West to certain localities In this
State which. Invite colony settlements. Many
of these people are coming here to engage in
dairying; and diversified farming:. In many
cases communities are sending representatives
in: advance to learn conditions and make ar
rangements for the balance of the party. It Is
found that by sotting forth the truths refrardlnÂ»
the State as the committee is doing In Its per
sonal correspondence and in its literature the
people who come. here are satisfied with what
they find and are the means of bringing many
more to California. â¢ .';.â¢â¢ â¢.

The committee has submitted a plan to all
the newspapers and periodicals of the State and
many of the prominent publications throughout
the United States for the formation of the Cali
fornia Publication Bureau, the object being to
publish throughout sections of California end
the Unlte-1 States reliable and Interesting mat
ter on California's resources In'Vartous sections
of thn State, and so through effective and gen
eral co-operation to create an enthusiasm which
shall extend widely. In the plan It Is provided
that each member shall republlsh a certain
number of articles which have been published
by other members. Thus the resources cf Jtf

The ngltatlon for new and better hotels
throughout the interior of the State to provide
lor the large Increase In the number of tour
ists Is having Its effect. Many new hotels are
going up and many are being projected. The
tourist in California .is worthy of speclal-atten
tlon, and It is gratifying to note that the people
of the StKte*generally have come to a realiza
tion of that fact. The State has unparalleled
natural attractions for the tourist and his mate
rial comforte must bo catered to as well. In
Ban Francisco, with the new hotels going up.
the city will be placed In a position unexcelled
In this respect.
The necessity for a coliseum In San Fran
cisco suttable for large conventions has been so
thoroughly demonstrated that local parties are
now Interf-stlng themselves In the matter, and
it will not be Ions before such a building will
be erected.

In Its correspondence the advantages In diver

The efforts of the committee to induce large
holders of land in California to subdivide li
meeting with encouragement. From advices re
ceived numbers of land holders have expressed
their willingness to sell off farms Of from flve
to . twenty-live acres each. The benefit to be
derived from this Is apparent and will be an
important factor In bringing the right kind of
people to the State. The, land owner realize*
that In bubdividing a portion of his property
In thi3 way he Increases the value of the prin
cipal holding and has available help to work In
the orchards and fields during the busy seasons
of the year. The benefit to the settler who
takes up such small tracts Is also great from
the fact that he is able to secure employment
for himself and family when It Is needed, bring
ing In a revenue that he would not enjoy un
der other conditions. -The Sacramento Valley
Development Association has taken up in earn
eet the matter of subdividing land in .the valley
and will be a valuable ally to this committee
In the movement.

almost gasped its last. The "tea" is in
a measure responsible, for the vapid

passing, howeverâ possibly through the
law -of the survival of the fittest â and
musicales, receptions, where one can
remain long enough to catch a breath,
and incidentally a thought, and quiet
informal "at homes" are the things to

The trial of Mrs. Martha E. Bowers,
charged with the murder of her hus
band, Martin L. Bowers, is drawing to
a close before a jury In Judge Cook's
court. Several witnesses were exam
ined yesterday and the prosecution in
timated its case would be finished this
morning.
The most important witness yester
day was Mrs. D. D. McCallum. who
had not previously testified. She said
she came from Portland in the latter
part of last May, and shortly after
ward she met the defendant in Mrs.
Follis' saloon on Fifth street. The de
fendant said she was expecting Pat
(meaning Patrick Lervy), and he soon
made his appearance. From the sa
loon they went to Mrs. Bowers' house,
and Lervy went out for beer. One
evening shortly after that, just before
Bowers' sickness, she called upon the
defendant and Lervy came in. The
defendant sat on his knee, put her
arms around his neck and kissed him.
She did that several times during the
evening.
BOWERS WAS ANGERED.
Bowers came home about 9 o'clock
and seemed to be very angry at find
ing Lervy there. The defendant said
to witness, "Introduce your friend,"
but she could not do so, as she only
knew him as Pat. Lervy came to her
assistance by giving his - name, and
Bowers replied, "Yes, I have heard of
you before." Bowers walked backward
and forward in an angry manner and
witness said she would go home. Lervy
said he would go with her, and they
left. A few days later witness met
the defendant and Lervy on Folsom
street, and witness said she had seen
Bowers on Fifth street, which so
alarmed the defendant that witness
told her she was Joking.
DRAWS MONEY FROM BANK.
William Meyers and Mrs. Margaret
Follis, who have saloons in the neigh
borhood of the defendant's residence,
testified that the defendant and Leryy
had frequented their places together.
Robert P. Kavanaugh testified to the
defendant having drawn from the Hi
bernia Bank $2608 on the day after
her husband's death. It was on de
posit In their joint names.
Harry E. Bowers, brother-in-law of
the defendant, corroborated the testi
mony of his wife as to his brother's
condition from Ausust 16; when* they
were sent for, till his death on. August
25. He denied that he gave his brother
any medicine, except once at the re
quest of the defendant^
Detective T. L. Ryan testified as to
arresting the defendant, and Detective
T. J. Coleman, Dr. C. L.. Morgan, Dr.
Carl W. von.Tiedemann and Mrs. Sadie
Bowers were recalled. Dr. Morgan said
he had found four/ distinct marks of
arsenic on an old skirt which had bfeen
worn by the defendant, and Mrs. Sadie
Bowers Baid that both the defendant
"and her sister, Mrs. Sutton, had ordered
the cloth for their mourning dresses
before Bowers' death.
J. H. Goldman, Governor of the
province of Bataan, arrived on the
Transport Sheridan from the Philip
pines yesterday and is staying at the
Occidental. He is home on a leave of
absence but does not expect to return
to the islands. The Governor went to
the Philippines as a captain in the
Thirty-Second Regiment of Volunteers
and was later -appointed Governor of
the province, a position to which he
was re-elected after a term of two
years. His present term expires in
March, but owing to ill health it is
his intention to remain in this country.
Governor Goldman hails from Mis
souri and is a lawyer. He declares
that there is little prospect of further
troubles in the Philippines, but is of
the opinion that it will take many
years to establish a modern form of
government among that Oriental race,
who, he declares are unable to govern
themselves.
I>eclares He Is Done With the Philip
pines and Will Return to His
Home in Missouri.

RUSSIAN KEEPS
HIS NEW YEAR
Even in the face of numerous letters
offered in evidence, which were ex
changed between Mrs. Hart and her
sister a short time prior to the latter' s
death. Hart reiterated his statement
that Miss Clark was, in his opinion,
of unsound mind. The letters from 'Mrs.
Hart to the deceased were in relation
to an exchange or sale of the property
owned by Miss Clark at Tenth and
Market streets, and In no one of the
answers written by Miss Clark was
there anything that could be construed
into a display of weak mentality. On
the contrary they were all very short
and read like letters written by a clever
business woman.
Further evidence in the case will be
taken Monday next.
Jerome A. Hart, brother-in-law cf
Isabella Clark, whose will is the sub
ject of a contest brought by Ann Car
ter and Alice Hart, her sisters, was
cross-examined yesterday by Attorney
W. S. Goodfellow. attorney for Grace
E. Strohn, beneficiary under Miss
Clark's will. Hart stuck to his state
ment that he did not consider Miss
Clark mentally sound at the time the
will was made and for several months
prior thereto.

Colonel Oliver J. Sweet, commander
of the Twenty-eighth Infantry, was the
ranking officer on the Sheridan. The
Twenty-eighth has been two years in

Jolo. of which island Colonel Sweet was
the first governor. There were two
chaplains on the transport. Chaplain
C C. Bateman of the Twenty-eighth

with officers and men. Chaplain H.
Percy Silver, who also returned on the
Sheridan, attends to the spiritual needs
of the Thirtieth Infantry.
Private August Tniele of the
Eleventh Infantry died on board, De
cember 18, from chronic dysentery.
The weather was fine throughout the
voyage and Captain Peabody, as usual,
brought his ship to^ port looking j as
clean as nhen she sailed from here. The
Sheridan will return to Manila Feb
ruary 1. She docked late yesterday
afternoon and no time will be lost in
gettins her ready for sea.
The baby boy of Lieutenant Holden
Olin of the Thirtieth Infantry was
christened during the voyage, both
army chaplains officiating. John
Hoiden Olin is the youngster's official
name, but "Buster" Olin is the name

VICTORIA. B. C, Jan. 14.â Archie
King, cabin boy of the steamer Clal
lam, appeared before the Coroner's in
quest to-day and after narrating the
circumstances of the accident he said
that about a month before the disas
ter the steamer Clallam broke down off
Port Townsend and two tugs went to
her assistance. Some of the passengers
went back to Port Townsend. The en
gines were repaired Â»nd the steamer
proceeded back herself.
King heard of no distress signals be
ing displayed at, the time the steamer
founded. He told of finding a baby
boy about 4 years old asleep in the
cabin and of taking him to the saloon
and putting a life preserver on him.
He did not see the child after leaving
him there to go to the boat deck
whence the boats were lov.ered. No
orders were given for efforts to rescue
those capsized from the boats. No oil
was thrown out to calm the waves
when the boats were launched.

CHICAGO, Jan. 14.â Dispatches indicating
that war may be averted led to heavy sell
ing of wheat, to-day during the last hour of
trading:. The market closed ragged, with
prices %@%c lower, than yesterday. May com
showed a final gain of %c', oats %c, but pro
visions were 10c to H5c. lower.
The opening in wh-at was a trifle easier, in
fluenced by liberal receipts . in the Northwest
and by an advance In the price of British
consols. The sentiment quickly changed, how
ever, and a strong undercurrent set in, which
carried the price steadily upward. The ad
vance was due to a considerable extent to the
display of strength shown In coarse grains,
although moderate buying by the big bull in
terest had a noticeable effect. After opening
%c to %@%c lower, at 87%c to S7%c, May
climbed up gradually with some slight pet
backs until It had reached the 87%c notch'
A . cablegram from Argentina mentioned tho
incessant rains prevailing throughout ' the
wheat section, and I thig gavÂ« encouragement
to buyer*. Dry weather in the Southwest and
on the Pacific Coast was also construed as a
bull factor. During the last hour the â¢ early
strength gave out, and under heavy liquida
tion the market started on a rapid decline
Influenced by peaceful cables there was quite
general selling late in the day by local trad
er*, who were also laboring under the im
pression that the leading long was sell Ins
through brokers. Before the downward course
w.is checked May sold at The close
was weak, with May at 8C%c. Clearances of
wheat and flour were equal to S9.8OO bushels.
Corn was active and strong. The close
found May at 4S%c, a gain of %c over-yes
terday's final figures. .
Oatt were excited ar.d Strong. May "closed
at 4<r%c, a gain of J ,Â»c for the day. The open
ing was %c lower, at 40%c.
Provisions were steady early in the day on
the strength in coarse grains. Later in the
besslon J the market eased off on selling by
outside interests as well as by local packers.
The lower prices at the yards were partly re
sponsible for the selling: movement. The close
was weak, with May pork 25c -lower at S12 95Â©>
12 97%. May lard was off 10c at $C 60, and
ribg down lC(gl2%c at*$O CO.

showed a slight increase in animation for a
brief time this morning and made some slight
progress to a higher level of prices, but trad

and the largest part of the gain was lost and
the doting easy. The most conspicuous move
mints ftvre still in the department of minor
stocli^. such as may remain idle for weeks at
a time unmoved by operations of pools formed
to make a market for the stock. The move
ment of thfse stocks is invariably accom
panied by the circulation cf rumors to give a
sctming explanation for the movement, such
as a prwbablo absorption of the property by a
larger railroad. None of the rumors of this

Peas and Beans continued to bring hl^h prices,

A car of Sweets was marketed, and as the
demand was slack the price was shaded. There

Trolley car Xo. 809 .? " "ie TurL
street line inward bound yesterday
morning collided with a four-horse
truck belonging to . the United Rail
roads Company at- Gough street. The
car was full of early' morning pas
sengers. . Among the passengers was
P. W. Lannon, residing at 2030 O'Far
rell street, who* works in the Empo
rium. He received a deep gash on
the left wrist by broken glass which
severed an artery. , Police Officer
Judge, who was also a passenger, see
ing the dangerous nature of Lannon's
injuries, pressed the service of an ex
press wagon and hastened to the
Emergency Hospital, where Dr. Pink
ham ' tied the artery : : and saved the
man's life.: The driver of the truck,
W". JIcKlnnon, was- thrown from- his
scat by the impact and fell between
the horses and the vehicle, from which
place he was extricated by Officer
Judge.
The car was in charge of Conductor
C. B. Kenney and Motorman F. ,H.
Chamberlain. The latter lost con
trol of his car because of the wet
rails. The other passengers Jumped
off and escaped injury.
Car Collides With Truck.
Perhaps on account of his diminutive
size, the 1 little bear cub born yesterday
morning got, the overlook from the
mother grizzly. Leland, the keeper, of
the bears, with the assistance of a po
liceman, got the; culj out of. the in-;
closure and took it to the children's
quarters, where the matron, Mrs.Miil
more, arid her assistants ministered to
the wants . of the native son.
The cub's weight is slightly less than
one pound. The ladies in charge of the
children's quarters are very kind to
his cubship. The advice of the animal
expert at the Chutes was sought. He
suggested diet for the mother and cub.
This little bear Is said to be the first
grizzly ever born in captivity. . Mrs.
Millmore i and her staff of nurse3 as
sured the president of the Park Com
mission that they would do everything
possible to keep the bear alive. The
cub was taken from the pit where she
was perishing and placed ,in*;'aÂ£box
alongside the! gas range in the kitchen
of the children's quarters., .
It is the opinion of the Commissioners
and the superintendent that the big
windmill on the ocean beach has.prac
tically solved : the water -, problem, so
far as it relates to the west end of the
park, where water is most ' needed to
transform the waste of sand intp lawns,
lakes and flower gardens. Thefsuppiy
of water is so abundant that constant
pumping does not exhaust the wells.
The inflow is continuous and the water
very near the ocean is clear and fresh.
The most direct route to the new 1 lake
Is via tho McAllister ' street car line.
The Casino extension of the road takes
passengers, to a point but a short dis
tance fronv- the lake. .' . . ;
SOLVES WATER PROBLEM.
The breeze yesterday afternoon, was
light The slow motion of the big arms
of the mill indicated '.hat the flow of
water through the main was not
greater than 10,000 gallons per hour.
When the wind blows with usual sum
mer time velocity the mill liffs 20,000
gallons an hour.
The new lake is 900 feet long. The
width varies from COO to .600 feet. -The
depth is. slightly in excess of six feet.
The superintendent, however, does not
intend to fill up" the lake to the brim
at once. When a depth of two feet is
attained the stream will be turned Into
the reservoir on the summit of an ad
jacent hill. The new sheet of water
will surely be regarded as one of the
chief attractions of the beautiful park.
The environs of the lake are enchant
ing from a natural point of view. j
LIGHT BREEZE BLOWS.
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon -the
water was turned into the big basin,
known as Model Yacht Lake. There
were no ceremonies to speak of In con
nectipn with the introduction of the
waler. Promptly at the time appoint
ed A. B. Spreckels, president of the
Park Commission, and John McLaren,
superintendent, directed the adjust
ment of the valve and the water be
gan to pour in, the flow being esti
mated at 10,000 gallons an hour. The
capacity of the new lake is 7,000,000
gallons.
The supply Is derived from the wells
near the ocean beach, which source
seems almost inexhaustible. The new
Dutch windmill pumps the water from
the wells to the lake on the northerly,
sidesof the park, . between Thirty-first
and Thirty-sixth avenues, a mile and
a half distant from the pumping plant.
Thursday, January 14. was an event
ful day in Golden Gate Park. Early in
the morning a bear baby .was born to
"'r. and Mrs. Monarch at their home in
the bear pit.
A twenty-four days' trip across the Pacific
on the Sheridan, stopping for a short while at
Honolulu, has brought us to San Francisco
where we expect to stay a short time. The
itinerary through Los Angeles El Paso and
New Orleans is the one we will follow if we
can get two bicycles. We expect to arrive in
Havana by the end of March at the latest, this
belr.g our starting point.'
Hongkong was duly reached and it proved to
bÂ» the worst place we had ever been In
Owing to the kindness of the American Consul
we got passage on board the Naehau. a United
States collier, to Manila, arriving in the Philip
pines forty-eight hours after leaving China.
The newspapers in Manila, both .Spanish and
American, treated us very kindly and through
them we gave a lecture in a theater which
left us enough to go to Yokohama with Think
ing we could get a vessel in the place, we were
badly disappointed, being sent to Nagasaki by
the quartermaster, who advised us to wait for
the Sheridan.
From Rangoon we got a free passage to Pe
nang and there a Jrcal newspaper paid for our
passage to Singapore. Trying to get work in
this latter place v.e spent what little we had.
and. nearly starving, finally stowed away on
u steamer engaged in the coolie trade going to
f'hinu. The trip lasted five days. The first
two we had to work as stokers, but later were
transferred to the engine-room, greasing and
cleaning brasework.
The â¬50 milee between here and Madras we
macie partly on foot and tometlmes by rail,
when we could beat the road. The editcr of
the Madras Times gave us work for a week,
which Enabled us to pay for our passage to
Kangoon. Kurmah.
HONGKONG THE WORST.
Hardships beset us in Naples, where we were
obliged to leave the tandem and stow away
on a steamer going to Australia. When we
were found the captain was ro kind as to give
us work o:i board, allowing us to go ashore in
Port Said and Suez before we landed In Co
lombo, Ceylon. Difficulties arose which com
pelled us to work at chopping wood to get tick,
ets worth ?1 to Tuticorin, India. .
Paris was our next stopping place. A sport
ing newspaper started a subscription on our
behalf which placed encugh money at our dis
posal to support ourselves going to Lyons, Mar
seilles and Nice. From Xice we went to Monte
Carlo, where we stayed two days, and then a
short five days took us to Genoa. A race was
arranged in a local club, which we won, with
some difficulty. The bicycle was then sent by
rail to Naples, while we took a rfiip for the
same place.
Two weeks were spent in this place looking
for work on board trans-Atlantic steamers, but
none was to be found. We had nearly given
up hope when by mere luck a Jewish agency
got us passage on board a cattle ship going to
Liverpool. We had a terrible trip across the
Atlantic Ocean, working as cattle feeders and
undergoing such hardships that we almost en
vied the cattle we were caring for, they at
least being well fed, while we lived on hard
tack and water during the trip.
In Liverpool the owner of a tramp steamer
gave us passage to Spain, landing in Valencia
in April or thereabouts. We then went over
land to Barcelona and thence through Zaragoza
to Madrid, where we had some relatives. Two
weeks afterward we etruck the road north
ward toward France, going through many in
teresting cities, fuch as Valladolid, Burgos and
Bilbao. Cro5sing the frcntiers of France
through Hendaya. we went to Bordeaux, scene
of the fatal ending of the Paris-Madrid auto
mobile race.
From Tampa we followed the railway tracks
to Jacksonville, Fla.. and had a very narrow
escap* from death while attempting to cross a
trestle-work bridge. About half way across,
bearing the tandem on our shoulder* , we saw
a passenger train coming upon us at fuli
speed. barely had time to tie the bicycle
to the trestles with a strap and hang under
neath when the train passed over our heads.
letters of recommendation to steamship agen
cies In Jacksonville provided us work on board
a Clyde Line steamer going to New York.
HORRORS OF CATTLE SHIP.
V\> BtÂ»rte<l on December 20, 1902. from Cuba,
stowing away on a steamer bound for Key
West FU. cm our arrival in the latter place
we were taken in charge by the authorities,
not having th<> 530 required by the. immigra
tion Ibwb of the United States, but influential
friends havinK secured our release, we re-em

BURTON HOLMES LECTURES
ON YELLOWSTONE PARK
Lieutenant Governor Alden Andersen,
who recently announced his intention
of resigning the positlon\>f manager of
the California Fruit Distributers, has
been; induced to' reconsider the move,
and yesterday the organization showed
its. apprecfation of his services by re
electing him its manager. The. associa
tion held its annual meeting at the Pal
ace Hotel and elected the following of
ficers: President, Frank II.. Buck; vice
president; W. E. Gerber; secretary and
manager, Alden Anderson; directors,
H. A. Fairbanks, C. M. Hartley. T. M.
B. McKevitt, G. D. Kellogg, A. R.
Sprague. C. B. Bills, A. H. Schnable
and. A. C. Short. ..'
The evening session was devoted to
the reading- of various reports, among
them, .the annual \ report . of Manager
Anderson, .which incorporated practi
cally the same matter that he recently
furnished to the fruit .-ro./ers at their
session in Fresno and-in a special arti
cle, prepared for The Call. One feature
of hl3 Teport, and an exceedingly inter
esting'one to the fruit shippers of this
State, refers to data gathered, from all
sections of the country, showing that
the present methods - of the California
shippers are being adopted by shippers
in â other , agricultural 1 districts of the
country. This information was gleaned
from I numerous reports received from
the agents of the '.California Fruit Dis
tributers in other parts of the U_lted
States. For instance one report from
the East states that the apple growers
there are abandoning the use of Ibarrels
for the shipment of their product and
adopting the Calif oinia method of
papking In fruit boxes.
Manager j Anderson's â¢ report deals at
length with Â¦ the necessity of getting
imp: oved service from the railroad
companies for the expediting of Eastern
shipments. While no particular . fault
is found with the' manner In which the
crop of last year was handled it Is
suggested that the association, by care
ful study, may. improve on the service,
with the co-operation of the transpor
tation companies. The association will
resume its session at th* I alace to
day.
Sudden Death of Miss Kaveny.
Miss Annie M. Kaveny, owner of a
dry goods shop at 3404 Mission
street, was found lying unconscious
in bed last .Wednesday evening at 6
o'clock. She slept in a room off the
shop and the door was locked. Gas
was escaping from a burner in the
show window.- A doctor was called,
but the woman died at 6:15 a. m. yes
terday. An autopsy showed that
death had been caused by fatty de
generation of the heart and cirrhosis
of the liver. The^ deceased was 45
years of acef^ 'l\-.Â£

of quail for scientific purposes, but

Large . Audience Enjoys Views of
Sppntlng Geysers nnd Other Won
ders of National Reservation.
Burton Holmes has a happy knÂ«ick
of transporting his audiences from any
side and up and down and all over
the globeâ east. west, north or southâ
with consummate ease and skillful per
suasion. Wednesday night he filled a
large audience with enthusiasm over
the delights of St. Petersburg, and
within twenty-four hours he . brought
his tourists right into the very heart
of nature's wonderland, the Yellowstone
National Park, the pride spot of Amer
icana and the admired of the foreigner.
With the magic aid of moving pic
tures, the greatest of geysers were
shown, spouting their millions of gal
lons of foaming water. Gigantic moun
tains, canyons, rivers and lakes were
presented in all their grandeur. '
Glimpses were given in the great gey
ser basins and the coloring of the va
rious-pictures,' sunset and night effects
and the day's lights and shades, was
remarkable enough'to. send the assem
blage into raptures.
To-night Burton Holmes takes the
Jump to Moscow, where he will relate
historical events and present pictorials,
both stÂ«reopticon and moving, of scenes
which are of most interest to those vis

fn the .Treatment of Humours
with More Than Magical
Effect with
CUTICURA -REMEDIES.
A Remarkable Testimonial from
a Most Intelligent and
Trustworthy Lady.
; "A tnmor came on my neck and in a
day or two it was as large as half an
orange. I was very much nlarmed for
fear it was malignant. My friends
tried to persuade me to consult niy
physician ;" bat dreading that he would
insist on using the knife, I would not
consent to go. Instead, I got Cuticura
Resolvent and Cuticura Ointment.*!' I
took .the former- according to r direc-
tions, and spread j a thick layer of the
1 Ointment on the swelling. On renew-
ing it I "would bathu my neck in very
/warm water and Cuticura Soap. In' a
few days ! the Cuticura Ointment had
drawn the swelling to a head, when it
broke. Every morning it-was opened
with a large sterilized needle, squeezed
and bothed, arid '.fresh . Ointment put
on. Pus^ and ; blood, and a' yellow,
-cheesy, tnmorons matter came out.*. In
about three ,^r' four weeks' time this
( treatment completely eliminated the
j, tu m or. 7 The . soreness ' that had ex-
\ tended f down^lnto my -chest was all
gone; and my neck now seems to be
perfectly ; well " , ' . -
"About five or six years ago my sis-
ter had a similar, experience,' used the
: Cuticura Remedies with 'magical [effect. ;
I anifWtlHnc you should usa my testi-
monial, with: the v further privilege of.
revealing my name and address to soch
; persons - as may -wish . to substantiate
the abovo statements by personal letter
