CribrU, June 27, 10:30 a* m. â A Chinese who has arrived here from the vicipity or rort Arthur ma junk reports that at daylight last Friday

CONTENDING FLEETS LOSE HEAVILY IN NAVAL
BATTLE FOUGHT OFF PORT ARTHUR HARBOR
Shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday
morning Andrew Riley. a hodcarrier.
was found In a dying condition near
the corner of Sheridan and^- Ninth
streets. He died a few hours later.
A bq.Het had crashed into his brain.
The Southern police later located
Harry Radcliffe, a porter, who ad
mitted, shootlns Riley. Radcliffe said
the nian had insulted hi* wife. Mr*.
Radcllffe contradicted her husband's
story and the police' believe that Rad
cliffe held Riley up and murdered him
when he offered resistance.
RILEY'S SLAYEK IS FOUND
AND POLICE THINK HE SHOT
IN ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY
Police investigations corroborate
these favorable reports of Riley's char
acter- The detectives are confident
that he was. not the sort of man who
would insult a defenseless woman.
"I shot Andrew Riley because he In
sulted my wife." said Harry Radcllffe,
accused murderer, yesterday.
Continuing, he said: "My wife was
waiting for me at the corner of Ninth
and Folsom at 1 o'clock this morning.
Riley approached and insulted her
grossly. I followed him and killed
him."
Â¦ '"I was not with my husband at 1
o'clock," said Mrs. Harry Radcllffe to
Captain Martin yesterday morning.
"I have never seen Riley at any time
and he has never spoken to me."
These conflicting statements have
caused the police to adopt the theory
that Harry Radcliffe attempted to hold
up Andrew Riley early yesterday morn
ing. The latter evidently resisted with
all hi3 strength and Radcliffe shot him
fatally.
Radcliffe - admits the shooting, but
declares that it was done in defense
of his wife's honor. Shortly after mak
ing the assertion that may place a
noose about her husband's neck. Mrs.
Radcliffe disappeared from sight of the
police.
It is believed that Radcllffe's half
brother, "'Dr. J. J. Keefe. advised the
woman to go into hiding until a law
yer can be secured for the prisoner.
Keefe would, neither admit that he
knew her whereabouts, but when last
heard of she was with him.
Radcliffe's victim was a hodcarrier.
He lived at 23 Sheridan street for four
years and had born an excellent repu
tation. Former neighbors say he was
a good natured. Inoffensive fellow, who
was never known tc- harm anybody.
Mrs. Cox. his landlady, said that in
the four years he had lived at her
house he had never missed a day's
work. He had never been under the
influence of liquor nor troubled her
in any manner. He told her he was to
be . married soon to a young woman
who bore the same name.

Governor Odell's action in Chicago,
when he tried first to bring about the
nomination of Speaker Cannon instead
of Senator Fairbanks for Vice Presi
dent against the wish of Senator Platt,
and then attempted to adjourn the con
vention on the second day, are being
used by the Platt men to enforce their
argument that the Governor and his
friends are not sincerely in favor of the
success of the Republican ticket in
this State next falL

in his capacity of chairman of the

Governor Odell and his adherents are
pulling wires to obtain a candidate who
will perpetuate what the Governor has
already grained. The Platt men are pre
dicting that no candidate nominated by
Odell can be elected.
NEW YORK, June 26.â Senator Platt
is preparing to make a final stand ' In
the Republican State Convention to es

"I am out of political affairs," he
ccntinued. "I have said it often, so
that it ought to be well understood."
Asked what he thought of the sug
gestion that the Democrats would do
wisely to take their candidate for Vice
President from the Southern States,
the former President dictated the fol
lowing:
"I must decline to enter into any
discussion of political questions at this
time. It cannot be possible that my
opinion -on any question that is about
to be involved in the national canvass
can be misunderstood. I do not expect
to be concerned actively in the plans
that are now< occupying the thought
and effort of the Democratic managers,
and it is Quito proper that I should be
out of that account. Inasmuch as I con
sider myself as absolutely retired from
political activities."
His first answer was a pantomime.
He vigorously shook his head and lifted
his hand deprecatingly. Then he ex
claimed with rapid utterance:
"That will not happen, that will not
happen, so there is no use of talking
about it.
"If the Democratic National Conven
tion again nominates you for the Presi
dency would you accept?" he was
asked.
PRINCETON. N. J., June 26.â
Former President Cleveland discussed

In high court and army and naval

not attempt to disguise the seriousness
of and. the > far- reaching consequences

ST. PETERSBURG, June 28.â Up to
to-night the Japanese report of the loss
of three Russian ships at Port "Arthur
has not been published here, although
the authorities have allowed to be
printed a statement that the. squadron
had made a sortie and also the news
of the loss of the Japanese torpedo boat
destroyers. 'Â¦Â¦'',
An official explanation of the sup
pression of the Japanese report Is that
the Admiralty, is unwilling to unneces
sarily alarm the public by the circula
tion of such statements entirely, on the
authority of the enemy and in the ab
sence of definite advices from the com
mander at Port Arthur. It is alsq sug
gested as possible that there has been
a fight and that the Japanese have
minimized their own losses and magni
fied those of the Russians with a view
of effecting the. new loan which. It is
understood, Japan Is negotiating.
On the other heand, according to a
foreign naval attache, the Admiralty
to-day admitted that Rear Admiral
Withoeft, the naval ppmmander at Port
Arthur, lost one battleship and two
cruisers, but in the absence of details
there was an inclination to believe that
the ships struck some mines, the Ad
miralty not believing, in the face of
the lessons taught by the injuries to
the Retvizan and the Cesarevitch. that
Admiral Withoeft would have remain
ed in the outer roads at night, thus in
viting the dash by the Japanese . de
stroyers.

NEW YORK. June 26.â After a bat
tle that was marked by ferocltv and
cunning. The King, a fine specimen
of the buffalo, the recognized leader of
the William C. Whitney herd in the
New York Zoological Park, and hither
to the undisputed champion of all buf
faloes, went down to defeat and death
to-day in a ..duel; with Black Beauty,
an old enemy. For twenty minutes the
big brutes waged bitter fight, resist
ing the efforts of the keepers to sep
arate them. No such conflict had ever
been witnessed, in the park,, although
Black Beauty had been worsted several
times by The King in minors encoun
ters. Beauty resorted to tricks in order
to avenge the humiliations The King
had heaped upon him. While the ruler
of the herd was lying on the grass
enjoying a siesta his enemy attacked
him, embedding his sharp . horns in
the side of The King. : ' Then . followed
a fight for mastery that will go down
In the history of the park as the most
ferocious ever witnessed.
Staggering to his feet after the first
attack; 'The King, with, a bellow of
fury, closed with his. enemy. Swaying
their shaggy heads from side to side,
charging and wheeling, the huge ani
mals gored each other with an aban
don-that struck terror to the hearts
of . their comrades, who withdrew to
view, the conflict from a safe distance.
The bisons struggled for supremacy,
their' loud bellowing being 'distinctly
heard a cuarter of a mile away. The
keepers were attracted by the tumult.
At the risk of their lives they attempt
ed to separate the infuriated animals
with pitchforks and pikes. . .
. The King, although badly j crippled
by the Injury he received at' the first
attack, for a time proved a match for
his enemy. But it was his last battle,
for with a rush that was not to be
denied Beauty, ."hooked" The King
through the lungs and the champion
fell to the sward. In vain he tried to
stagger to his feet. But he had received
his death blow and gradually>he sank
to .the; ground. Black Beauty 1 , became
the ruler of the combined herds.
; TberKing was the finest buffalo in
captivity in the United States.

"Subsequently the Japanese decoyed
the Russians out to sea and awaited an
opportunity to be'gin a general action,
but between 8 and 9 p. m. the Russian

deavoring to dispose of the mines laid
by the Japanese, but they were hin
dered by two Japanese torpedo-boat
destroyers, which had been guarding
the mouth of the harbor.
"At 3 p. m. the Japanese torpedo

the clearing operations- One of the
Russian destroyers was set on fire and
retired inside the harbor.

JACKSON*. Miss.. June 26. â Governor
Vardaman was not notified of the cap
ture cf Stirling Dunham and his return
to Europa until this afternoon. He im
mediately telegraphed to the Sheriff of
Wilson County asking If, troops were
..needed to protect the prisoner. The
lynching had occurred, however, before
he was apprised that Dunham had been
brought back to Mississippi.
<X>unfcam was captured on Friday
rear Vienna, Ala., after a running
cfta^e. during which he was twice
o wour.ded. "He was brought here last
night by the Sheriff- of this (Wilson)
county. A large mob met the train at
ttie railroad station and an effort was
made to cet the negro, but the officers
spirited him away and carried him to
the Jail at Walthall. six miles from
here, where the party was again met
by a mob of determined men, who said
their intention, was to burn Dunham.
The officers in charge of the negro suc
ceeded in prevailing upon the mob to
give up this Intention, but only after
promising to deliver up the negro this
nforning for execution. There was a
Etror.g sentiment for burning, but this
was overcome and the lynching: took
the form of a hanging.
"Dunham stoutly maintained his inno
cence to the last and denied that he
had ever eecn the Wilson girl. He ad
mitted having visited Dunn's place, but
denied any bad motive. His last re
marks were made to 200 negroes who
were assembled about the place of exe
cution, Dunham telling them never to
go about a white man's house when
women were at home alone.
The noose was placed about the ne
gro's [ neck by the little "Wilson girl,
Â¦who c>ositively identified him as her as
sailant. The negro was then placed on
the back of a black horse and at a sig
nal from tiie leader of the mob the lit
tle girl \$ d the horse, from under him.
More than â¢ 3000 persons, white and
black, witnessed the hanging.
The lynching was as orderly as a le

the body and turned it over to relatives

TOKIO. June 26.â The failure of the
Russians to supply information con
cerning Japanese prisoners of war in
their possession is arousing' a strong
feeling of resentment here.
It is probable that the American
Government will be asked to make
pointed inquiry at St. Petersburg con
cerning the .present condition of Jap
anese prisoners and to arrange a sys
tem of regular reports.

GUAYAQUIL. Ecuador. June 26. â
Much excitement, followed by rioting,
has resulted here from the action of
the municipality in raising the tariff
for water sen-ice. Two meetings were
held in this city during the evenings
of June 22 and 24, and on the night
of June 24 about S000 citizens par
aded the streets, protesting against the
Council's action. Mounted policemen,
with drawn swords, tried to disperse
the paraders, who attacked the police
with stones. Before dispersing, how
ever, the rioters stoned the house of
the president of the Municipal Coun

One night I made an inspection and

The ten columns breathe gloomy fore

holds the Emperor up to contempt as
an "unfortunate and entangled young
man, recognized as the leader of 130,
000,000 people, cruelly deceived and com

-vTolstol, however, does not stop with
Russia, for Japan is given a share of

LONDON, June 27.â The Times this
morning prints a ten-column disserta
tion on the Russo-Japanese war written
by Count Tolstoi in his most violent
style. The trend of this remarkable
document is, first, against all war; but
it is practically a thunderous philippic
against the Russian Government and
the Russian orthodox church and gen
erally against the existing order of
things.
Tolstoi says that the reservists
throughout Russia are "dissatisfied,
gloomy and exasperated, and the old
appeal for faith. King and fatherland

The story was brought to Stockton
by Carlos Sampson, one of the ball
players, who returned from the "scene
of the disaster at nodn to-day. Samp
son states that, the screeching . of the
runaway work train was beard about a
minute before the crash came. AS soon
as the passengers realized their danger
there was a mad rush for the doors.
Melone got clear of the rear platform,
but turned back to pull one of' the
frightened women off the platform.
Then the collision came. The body of
Mrs. de Martini was mashed to pulp
and Melone was caught in the wreck
age. .
For an hour and ten minutes the
gritty ball player was pinned across the
body of the woman he risked his life to
save. He was caught by his right arm
and shoulder. While volunteers, worked
to extricate him Melone endured awful
agony. "My God, get a. gun and shoot
me, boys," he exclaimed, "I can't stand
this longer." It was feared that it
would be necessary to amputate his
arm In order to release him. "Don't
let them cut my arm off," was Melone's
appeal to his comrades.
The engineer on the work train is
blamed for the accident. The railroad
company will not divulge his name.
The bodies of Mrs. Joseph de Martini
and Mrs. Frank Valente, the victims,
are still at Jamestown. The former will
be brought to Stockton for burial, while
the latter will be interred at -Murphys.
STOCKTON, June 26.â Out of last
evening's fatal t^ain wreck on the Sier

Stockton women lost their lives, comes
a story of bravery and heroism on the

er, who was one of the injured. The
young man all but lost his life in an at
tempt to rescue Mrs, Joseph de Martini,'
one of the women killed.

i It is conceded on every hand that}
while the details are not yet fully
known, when both sides tell ths whole
story the calamity to Russiawill be in
creaseM. It ' is pointed out, however,
that Port Arthur is open and that the
Vladivostok fleet . may make another
diversion, in which case the remnants
of the Port Arthur squadron may at
any time make a forlorn hope dash for
a juncture. â¢ ,
The editorials, special dispatches and
articles by war experts join in express
ing the belief that great events are
impending and 'that the next few days
may have a great bearing on the final
result of the war.
LONDON, June 27.â This morning's
editorials by war experts devote much
space to the situation at Port Arthur.
The general view is that the Russians
at Port Arthur lost their opportunity
through their timidity and that Togo
has again asserted his right to be con
sidered one of the world's great ad
mirals. .
Mastery Over the Enemy.
Assert That He Has Again Proved His
BIUTONS LAUD TOGO.
General Ma is said to have moved
northward into Mongolia, which brings
him nearer the seat of war and encour
ages, the chunchus. The Russ says:
"The chunchus are increasing dally
under Japanese leaders, and keep Ren
nenkampff's entire force busy. The
Chinese are doing everything to hamper
our movements, even unrooting grow
ing crops."
NeWB from Newch wan g is highly
misleading. Several engagements end
ing unfavorably for the Russians, which
have never taken place, have been re
ported from there lately^ j Such reports
are brought by unreliable. Chinese, who
do a thriving business in selling sensa
tional news to correspondents.
The Siberian ."Drigade under General
Kondratenko has joined General Stak
elberg, and combined with his force is
falling back upon the north. The Rus
sians are terribly harassed by the
chunchus, wh*o are increasing in num
bers and audacity daily. Mistchenko's
mission to stop the* juncture of Kuroki
and Oku is said to have failed. â¢ .
Military opinion is firmly of the belief
that . the Japanes are . determined to
force a battle. The apparent slowness
in operations is due to the desire of
both Kuroki and Oku to advance in
dependently. However, the difficulty of
taking supplies over a broken country
points probability that the bat
tle, which it Is admitted cannot be
averted, will take place at Kaichou.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 26.â In St.
Petersburg Interest in the 7 war is once
again at high pressure. Great, indeed,
is the jubilation here at the fact that
the entire Russian fleet has been able
to get out of Port Arthur. It comes as

and every one is realizing that most
important news may be expected at
any moment
It is reported that a serious land
fight has taken place near Taichekiao,
in which the Russians were defeated,
but no confirmation of this repoTt is
obtainable. /
LIAOYANG, June 26.â The Second
Japanese army under General Oku is
withdrawing all along the line, having
apparently abandoned the Intention of
effecting a Juncture with General Ku
rc-ki's army.
Another man, also with a criminal
record, is being sought by the police,
and Magistrate Pool's action gave pub
licity to-day to the investigation which
has been going on for two weeks, and
which Inspector McClusky did not wish
to reveal until he had both the sus
pected men in custody.
Mrs. Hall said that about November
25 of last year a man unknown to her
previously had~ called at her house one
night and asked to rent a room. He
was shown one and promptly accepted
it and paid a week's rent in advance.
He left and did not return until the
week had, almost expired. "When the
man returned he was accompanied by
two others and one of them, she be
lieves, was Kingsley, the wealthy
Vermonter.
The missing man was of marked
personal appearance â short, very bald
and wore glassesâ and Mrs. Hall's de-
Bcription fitted that of Kingsley in
every particular.
The supposed Kingsley and his two
companions remained in her home
only about twenty minutes. Mrs. Hall
said that during that time he wrote
on a card for her: "Henry Baxter's
two friends."
From C000 photographs at police head
quarters Mrs. Hall selected one of
Frank L. Stewart, recorded as a sneak
thief, and that of another man. Refer
ence to the records showed that Stew
art, had been frequently arrested for
larceny here, once since the disappear
ance of Kingsley.
The Inspector said that both men
could be picked up.

The Perdicaris affair is over, he says,

Raissouli daily called and held long

He says that on the night of May
IS he had just entered the dining room,
and, hearing a noise amon gthe ser
vants, he and Cromwell Varley, the
British subject who was also captured
by Raissouli, went out to investigate
the cause. They were immediately sur
rounded by armed Moors, who bound
and maltreated them. Varley resisted
and was struck on the head with the
butt of a rifle and a knife was slashed
across his hands, making serious
wounds. Perdicaris and Varley were
then carried away on horseback.
At Tharradent the captives lived in

President Roosevelt evidently gets a
great deal. of exercise out of the game,
for he plays earnestly from the mo
ment he sets foot on the court. When
he serves he drives the ball resolutely
over the net and his returns are usual
ly made with great force. As in almost
everything else he does, the President
seeks results and not "form." He
appears to move rapidly over the
court, but his stride is short and ho
does not cover as much ground as
does the more slender Garfield. who
plays a 'thoughtful and easy game.

David B. Hill must withdraw as

the Judge's disconsolate friends, and
the Judge must declare himself upon
some of the issues of the hour. These
demands are coming in from all parts
of the country, and they are casting
melancholy . clouds upon the Parker
horizon.
William F. Sheehan and other friends
of the Judge spent the day with him
I and these matters were carefully con
sidered. It was intimated that as a re
sult of this conference some announce
ment may come from Judge Parker or
his close friends to-morrow.
Friends of Cleveland bestirred them
selves to-day and tried to put into mo
tion a boom for him. Many telegrams
were sent to leaders in the South and
West informing them of the condition
of affairs here and urging Mr. Cleve

CALIFORXIAXS IX EAST
shortly after 1 o'clock Radcliffe. hat
less and covered with blood, burst into
a saloon at the corner cf Tenth and
Folsom streets. Chris Sullivan and G.
H. Harris were standing by the bar.
Almost in a shriek Radcliffe cried
to Sullivan, whom he knew, "Send me
your hat." Before Sullivan could re
ply Radcliffe snatched the hat and fled.
Down the street he sped like a
frightened animal to his lodgings at
Eighth and Minna streets. Sullivan
and Harris stepped out to the sidewalk
to await his return, thinking they were
being hoaxed.
Meanwhile, Policemen Dunne and
Annear. who .bed heard the shooting,
hurried to where Riley lay in a pool
of blood. Two hats were on' the side
walk. One was Rfley's. the other Rad
cliffe's. v
liiley. who still breathed, was hur
ried to the Central Emergency Hos
pital, but the faint spark of life soon
fled. A bullet had crashed through his
brain.
Sergeant Bush of the southern sta
"tion arrived with a posse shortly after
the dying man had been removed. The
I>ciicemen began to Bcour the district
and came upon Timothy Mahoney, a
street sweeper, who had seen a bare
headed man running down Tenth
sm-et.
They followed this clew and met Sul
livan and Harris, who were waiting
the return of Radcliffe at Tenth and
Folsom streets.
â¢ Sullivan jruided the police to the resi
dence of liadcliffe's mother. She di
rected them to her son's lodgings at
Eighth and Minna streets.
Sergeant B'jsh and Policeman Cur
tin hurried up the stairway. Radclin>.
Mho was in his room, threw open his
door. He held his arms above his head
and cri^d, "I give up." Curtin quickly
placed the handcuffs on him.
Searching the room, the police found
that Radcliffe had thrown a collar be
spattered with blood under the bed.
The clothing which he had worn at
the time of the shooting lay upon the
floor. There was evidence of hasty ef
forts to cleanse the clothing of blood
stains. A bloody^ towel was found be
side them.
When Questioned as to what he did
with the Distol, RadoMffe was sullen
and replied. 'That's what you are paid
"to find out.**
The revolver was found at 5 o'clock
There is nobodv who actually saw the
shooting. Only Radcliffe can give the
details. His victim lived a few hours
but was unconscious up to the time
of his death. Â»
Quayle's story throughout seems to
corroborate the tale told by Mrs. Rad
cliffe to Captain Martin.
William Quayle. proprietor of the
Cape Breton lodging-house, where
Harry Radcliffe and his wife roomed,
made the following statement:
I have Jcaown Harry Radcliffe- for some
timfi. Last night he went cut early, saying he
was going to work, and told his young brtde
to ttay indoors, aa he did not want her to go
on the f-trÂ«tt aione. â¢ Shortly after his de-
I'arture Mrs. rtadrliffe became lonesome and
said t--hÂ» was going out for a short walk. I
think ghÂ« came back about 10 o'clock, going
Immediately up to her room. She has been In
th<* habit of burning fpe gas very late at
nicht. waitlnc for her husband. Sometimes
tf*<* pa" burned, until 2 o'clock. Last night
about 11 o'clock I 'went np to h?r room an.l
told her It was tim< to put out the gas. Ene
saM fhe had retired for the night and was
'â¢r.lv keeping the gas burning, expecting her
hurband. Xothin* further transpired until
a little after 2 o'clock this morning, when the
rollce arrived to gee rtadcllffe. Just as - thÂ»
noJice were about to take him away his wife
rsnw rushine up the stairs. This was nearly
.1 o'clock. Â£he Â»aid she hnd been out to get a
dnctnr to dress the wounds on his head. As
he was led away *he screamed, "Oh. my dar-
Ilnsr. my darling, what have you done? What
r.re thÂ»y taking you away for?"
Riley was 26 years old, a magnifi
cent specimen of manhood. He was
more than 6 feet tall and weighed
nearly 200 pounds.
QUAYLE'S STORY.
Radcliffe is held at the City Prison
on a murder charge. He is a porter,
but has been out of work for some
time. The prisoner is a native of Vir
ginia Citv. aged about 21 years. Ho
has been Vnarried only two weeks.
If she sticks to the story she told
Captain Martin there is strong cir
cumstantial evidence to show that
Radcliffe murdered Riley in an at
tempt at robbery. All the evidence
backs this conclusion.-- W-
â¢Mrs. Radcliffe, who had rushed to
the home of Dr. Keefe shortly after
her husband appeared before her,
splashed with blood, talked with Cap
tain Martin in the morning before her
husband told the above story.
. She was nervous and almost hysteri
cal. "I don't know anything about it."
she paid. don't know Riley. No;
he never spoke to me."
Then the woman collapsed and was
taken away by her landlord. William
Quale. She promised to return in the
evening, but the promise was not kept-
I did the FhootinR-, and am not sorry that I
killed a fellow like that. My wife has been
ccmplainir.g to me that every time she went
along Ktghth street she would be insulted by
men. I got home this morning about a quarter
to 1 o'clock and my wife complained of being
nek. I buggested that I should go for Dr.
John J. Keefe. 13OJ Folsom street, my half
brother, but after talking the matter over we
decided to go to the doctor's house. This was
a few minutes after 1. When we got to the
corner of KoJsom and Ninth streets I saw there
was no light in the doctor's rooms, so I told
rr.y wife t-j wait on the corner and I would go
and se* if he was in bed. I had Juet got to
the doctor's house when my wife came run
ning toward me and said a man had made an
insulting proposal to her. She pointed to a
3ian who was walking down Ninth street to
ward Harrison. I went after him. and when I
came up to him I asked him why he had In
sulted my wife. He said: "Who the is
your wife?" and I pointed to the corner and
sal<i: "That little woman standing there." He
called me an off*nÂ«ive name and struck at me.
W*e grappled anj he tripped me. falling on top
of me. lie grabbed hold of my hair and
bumped my head against the cobblestones, and
as he vu a much bigger and heavier man
than I and made a motlcn as if to draw a
knife or gun. I pulled out my gun and fired
two shots at him and he fell off me. I was so
excited afterward that I liardly knew what I
did. That is the true story. My wife told mÂ«
:!..ii she thought the man who made the tnsult
ir.g proposal to her had done so before and that
worked upon me.
The prisoner was taken to the City
Prison. There he claimed to be suf
fering fronra blow on the head received
from Rilev during the struggle. He
was taken to the Central Emergency
Hospital, where he was held until 1 his
victim died. All this time Radcliffe
was sullen and uncommunicative.
Later he made the following explana
tions to a Call reporter: x
by the detectives. In his flight Rad
cliffe had thrown it into a yard at 225
Eleventh street. Two of the chambers
were empty.

Ellis made an enemy of Moses R.
Crow, who once sued him, and Ellis
swore he would pursue Crow to the
ends of the earth, if necessary. Crow
finally died a maniac. In telling a
friend of his desire to punish Crow for
having dared to sue him. Ellis once
said:
Ellis is described as a man having
unbounded confidence in himself. He
has made no secret of his desire to be
come King of Abyssinia and he said
only recently that within two years he
expected to have command of $150,000,
000 and the resources of the richest
country in Ethiopia.
Ellis said he was born in Mexico,
where his father is still living. He is
big and strong and powerful in body as
he is masterful in mind. He obtained
such an influence over the widow of Hi
ram Hotchkiss. an inventor, that he
managed her vast estate with a profit
of $500,000. * * \
His departure for Africa, carrying

.RADCLIFFE SAYS VICTIM
INSULTED YOUNG WIFE
After saying that to make human
selfishness the fundamental standard
of right conduct is as disastrous as the
attempt to make our unchecked animal
instincts the standard of right conduct,
he continued:
Almost every evil â political, social or com
mercial â which constitutes a serious menacÂ«
to the permanent prosperity of our country
can be traced directly to our tolerant accept
ance of selfishness as a basts of morality.
Do not be blind to this truth, that If you
have no higher motive than your own personal
Interest, it means that your soul is for sale
if the price Is made sufficiently high. It is
for you to show In your lives that the honor
of a gentleman Is not for sale, the faith of a
Christian something more than an empty form
of speech. . 'Â»-'
There, are two philosophic of life which are
offered to- us in place of the religion of our
fathers â one which lays stress on the natural
Impulses as superior in authority to the dic
tates of a conventional morality: the other
which looks to enlightened selfishness^as the
means by which mankind is to be delivered
from unendine restraints of traditions. I be
lieve that each of these philosophies is er
roneous. Tbe one means a reversion toward
savagery ;the other a degeneration toward
social weakness.
If wealth and dominion follow as a result
of faith and enthusiasm, they are. good. But
if wealth and dominion are made a primary
object, and are trusted as a source of national
strength instead of its consequence or evi
dence, they- prove a false reliance. And it is
an unfortunate fact that very few nations
have achieved wealth or dominion without
suffering loss of faith and enthusiasm and re
matnir.K with the empty husk of greatness <*t
ihe very moment when they deemed themselves
most powerful.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.. June 26.â
Yale's commencement week was for
mally opened to-day when President A.
T. Hadley delivered the baccalaureate
address In Woolsey. HalL President
Hadley, after reviewing -the tendencies
of the times, said that faith, inspira
tion for the better things and enthusi

great. He continued:
A series of quarrels followed and
finally the bucks began to mistrust
their squaws and the battie followed.
Two of the Indians thought to have
been wounded were seen crawling to
the sagebrush and 8n account of the
darkness cannot be found. Constable
Wolf is investigating the case, but as
Indians seldom tell on each other there
is little likelihood of arrests being
made.
The Indians, about seventy-five In
number, came In this morning from
the ranches on the Meadows. They
have been engaged in helping to har
vest the hay crop. Once in town they
managed to secure a plentiful supply
of lig/aor and lost no time in getting

LOVELOCK, Nev.. June 26.â A
drunken orgic among Piute Indians In
this citv led to a miniature battle this
evening, in which ab'out one dozen

TACOMA, June 26.â A Puyallup In
dian potlatch given by Mrs. Anna
. Coates in honor of her husband, the
late Chief Coates, closed to-night with
a grand presentation of gifts of money
and clothing.
â¢ A feature of the potlach was the un
veiling this morning of a monument
erected, at the Indian cemetery by Mrs.
CVates, at a cost cf $1000, to her hus
t>and. Following the ceremony Mrs.
t'catrs distributed gifts in money to the
Indians present. The potlach cost her
nearly $4000. nsnch of this amount hav
ing Ix-en distributed in money gifts.
. An attempt was made by the In
dians Mrs. Coates had hired to roast a
â¢Â«=tper, but the effort was discontinued
ihis morning when it was discovered
that the steer was far from roasted,
while the odor pervading the vicinity
"almost drove the assembled Indians off
the reservation. A soap factory later
pwooped down upon the potla-tch and
. carried off the carcass.
â¢ There are almost 300 Indians present,
tome of whom came from tribes east
of the mountains. Seven tribes were
represented. To-morrow a portion of
them will engage in an Indian gamble
at Nlsqually reservation.
EpecisJ Dispatch to The CalL
The family lived in three small rooms
at 065 North Roby street, and to-day a
constable was to eject the. mother and
her babies from the premises for non
payment of rent. After Mrs. Kelsdzick
had been served with a summons to ap
pear in court she decided to end the
lives of herself and her little ones.
The three children â Bruno, Herman
and Walter, aged 7, 3 and 2 years, re
spectively â were found in bod locked
in one another's arms. The mother's
lifeless body was found lying on the
kitchen floor, while gas was escaping
from a jet in the room.
That the woman made every prepara
tion to do away with herself and the
children was evident. She first wrote
and sealed a letter addressed to a rela
tive in Germany. Then she bathed her
self and donned clean linen. Each child
had also been given a bath and clean
nightgowns placed upon them.
Several months ago Kelsdzick, who
was out of work at the time, became
insane from brooding over his troubles
and was sent to the asylum. Since that
time the mother, who was in poor
health, has had a hard struggle for ex
istence. Last week she became so 111
that she was unable to work, and she
had si>ent her last dollar for food for
herself and the children Saturday aft
ernoon.
CHICAGO. June 26.â Threatened with
starvation and with her husband hope
lessly insane in the asylum at Kanka
kee, Mrs. Anna Kelsdzick gave up the
struggle for existence, killing her three
small children and then ending her own
life. Illuminating gas was the means
of destruction she adopted, and when
the bodies were found early t-Â»-day all
four had been dead several hours.
Although a week has elapsed since
the disappearance of Loomis, the of
flcals still cling to the belief that he
will reappear when the effect of his
abstraction has worn off. Their belief
is due to a carefwl deduction from the
series of circumstances related by W.
J. Ellis, his companion on board the
steamship, and by Gustave Flamm of
San Francisco, who was a fellow pas
senger. This process of deduction
practically excludes the likelihood that
Loomis fell overboard. It leads to the
acceptance of Flamm's statement that
he saw Loomis get off at Plymouth.
Accordingly a minutely circumstantial
description of Loomis has been for
warded to Joseph Stephens, American
Consul at | Plymouth.
Although satisfied that Loomis was
not lost from the Kaiser Wilhelm the
officials foresee the possibility that
some harm may have befallen him after
he landed at Plymouth. However, they
consider this possibility rather remote.
The case is one of increasing mystery.
PARIS, June 26.â Not a word waa re
ceived to-day regarding the where
abouts of Kent J. Loomis, brother of
Francis B. Loomis, American assistant
Secretary of State, who disappeared
shortly before or after the arrival of
the North German Lloyd steamship
Kaiser Wilhelm III at Plymouth on
June 20.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 26.â The
press is able to announce on the au
thority of Plehwe, Minister of the Inte
rior, that there is no intention on the
part of the Russian Government to
place upon the Finnish people the re
sponsibility for the assassination of
Governor General Bobrikoff by Eugene
Schaumann. The Minister believes that
the crisis In the relations of Finland
and Russia has passed, and that the
grand duchy will recognize that its in
terests and those of Russia mutually
demand- closer ties.
It is as far from Russia's wish as it
would be contrary to her interests, the
Minister says, to destroy Finland,
which has a history and traditions of
its own. AH that Russia wants is the
recognition by Finland of Russian su
premacy.
The Senate desires to make clear to the
Finnish people what deeply sad consequences
the agitation of evil di!^cs?d and misguided
persons, who have urged disobedience of the
authorities, have already brought about and
what dangers threaten the country If this agi
tation shall continue unreslsted. The Senate
directs an earnest aDDeal to all right-mlndea
Inhabitants to co-ciÂ»*rate for the restoration
of cuiet and order In the country and to en
deavor, each one to Justify the confidence
which the Finnish people, after a century of
indissoluble union with the powerful Russian
empire has had the rood fortune to enjoy
on the part of the Russian sovereign under
whose beneficent protection Finland has de
veloped In the most fortunate- manner, both
spiritually and materially.
The Senat* assembled for the first time

that accounts for the wonderful success

Dr. Miles'
Anti-Pain Pills
They never fail to cure all cases of
pain, because they treat the Pain Source
â the nerves. By soothing the irritated
nerves they lessen the tension, build up
the strength, set the blood coursinc
through the veins, ar.d thus allay all
pain.
"Periodic headache, that unfitted me
for business several days at a time, has
bÂ»Â»rn my life experience. I found first
relief in LH-. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills, and
since then I invariably ward them off by

Sergeant Frank Lynch.
The ranges are 50, 100 and 150 feet.
This is the first time in the history of
the department that offlcial attention
has been given to pistol practice. For
some time even practice In rifle target

pistols, and to that end the ranges
have been constructed.

BERKELEY, June 26.â Professor
Svante August Arrhenius, who fills the
chair of general physics at the Univer
sity of Stockholm, Sweden, arrived at
the University of California this even
ing tÂ« take ui> his work as a member
<jf the summer school faculty. In spite
of his six teet and robust physique,
I'roftssor Arrhenius was greatly fa
tigued from his trip and limited his
audience to the interviewer at the
home of Professor Jacques Loeb, with
whom he will remain during the ses
sion.
Professor Arrhenius holds rank as
the greatest physieis* living. Besides
occupying: the chair ' of physics at
Stockholm, he is head of the National
Serum Institute of his native land. His
latest investigations have been in the
application of serum to the cure of
disease, and the results he has ob
tained in this field he offers to give
to the world for the first time in a
course of lectures that he will deliver
at thf summer school. These will with
out doubt be of very great interest to
the educated world and of the most
profound importance to scientists and
to the medical profession. Some of
Professor Arrhenius' achievements will
be given publicity through the univer
sity press.
Professor Arrhenius gave the follow
ing facts in an interview:
During my Fix weeks of lecturing at the
wniverÂ»iiy I intend to give the results of the
Â¦work that haa beÂ«n carried on by &ladsen, the
director of the institute at Copenhagen, and

"The regents sustained me," said
President Babcock. "and that was all I
reeded. Now the discipline is as good
as ever and there is no more trouble."
At the Faculty Club, where President
Babcock is a guest, he consented to
tell all about the mutiny out of which
he came victor. It seems that a partic
ularly unruly student among the 400
others at the University of Arizona
took exception to President Babcock's
attempt to discipline him. The presi
dent expelled the student, who then
fucceeded in working up a sympathetic
strike among his fellows. A delegation
waited on the president, but he stood
his ground, which caused some of the
ttudents to withdraw. Then the quar
rel reached the regents' ears and there
was an investigation that ended In the
complete vindication of the president.
Kendric C. Babcock, president of the
University of Arizona and formerly
professor of history at the University
*j* California, to-day related the story of
a mutiny among the stduents of the
institution over which he presides.
President Babcock was among the ar
rivals at the university this morning,
having ccme to rest and recover from
the strain attendant upon the suppres
sion of the uprising.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call
214S Center Street, June 26.
The general opinion is that these ap
pointed delegates will be for Knowland,
who Is favored by Congressman Met
calf. If this is done Knowland's nom
ination is assured, though what move
will be made by the friends of Senator
Lukens is not announced.
In case an appeal Is made to the Su
pervisors to force a primary in all dis
tricts It would be necessary to have
the boards of not only Alameda Coun
ty, but Contra Costa and Solano as
well, make a call for such an election.
It is generally believed that the Ala
meda County Supervisors are opposed
to such a primary and J. M. Stow of
Contra Costa Cpunty, who Is both Con
gressional Commltteeman and Super
visor of his county, absolutely controls
the situation in that section and will
oppose rural primaries. There are no
data in Oakland upon which to base
any opinion as to the position of the
Solano board. It is very unlikely that
any appeal will be made to this author
ity.
The meeting of this committee is
called for to-morrow afternoon in the
courtroom of Justice Quinn at the cor
ner of Eighth street and Broadway.
It is expected that the committee will
Issue a call for the convention that will
nominate a Congressman for the Third
District, apportion the delegates and
provide for the primary. The conven
tion will probably' consist' of 96 or 98
delegates, according to the basis of
apportionment; this means that 48 will
constitute a majority. Of this number
36 will come from the rural districts
outside of the cities of Oakland, Ala
meda, Berkeley and Vallejo, where the
primary law is mandatory. The com
mittee holds it in its power to appoint
these 36 delegates and upon this hinges
the only question that has arisen over
the convention. The candidate favored
by these delgates will have little
trouble securing the additional dozen
that will insure his election.
KNOWLAXD LEADS.
There has been some talk to the ef
fect that should the Congressional
Committee decide to appoint delegates
outside of the cities of the district, the
Supervisors would be asked to call ar
bitrary primaries in the rural districts
and that partitions to this effect were
already in circulation. Such petitions
are not in circulation, however, and
Mr. Lukens and his most ardent friends
say that they know of no such docu
ments.
RURAL PRIMARIES.
"Now that Congressman Metcalf has
publicly announced his acceptance of
the portfolio made vacant by the resig
nation of Secretary Cortelyou, I feel
free to declare myself a candidate for
the Republican nomination for Con
gress in this district."
By common consent or by authority
of the owners, it seems that all of the
names that have been mentioned as
possible successors to Congressman
Metcalf have been sifted down to two-
State Senator J. R. Knowland and
State Senator G. R. Lukens. When Sen
ator Lukens was asked if he had any
statement to make in regard to the use
of his name in connection with the Re
publican nomination in this district, he
replied that he had nothing to say be
fore the meeting of the committee to
morrow.
The meeting of the 'Republican Con
gressional Committee of the Third Dis
trict occurs to-morrow afternoon in this
city. State Senator J. R. Knowland to
day officially announced his candidacy
for the Republican nomination for Con
gress to succeed Victor H. Metcalf. The
Congressman goes East lo-morrow to
begin his duties as Secretary of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor.
Senator Knowland's statement is very
brief and confines itself merely to the
announcement of his candidacy, and
reads:

Wheeler at the recent inspection of the
cadet regiment and has filed his re
port, which gives praise to the students
and their commander. The report was
filed three weeks ago, but the presi
dent's office refused to permit its pub
lication, on the ground that it was an
attack on the administration. An at
tempt was made to change the drill
hc>ur of the students' regiment, and to
this Colonel Bauer strongly objected.
He was sustained by Governor Pardee.
The colonel held that, in view of the
Government's expenditures, the univer

to military Instruction.

' Valentine has been in the public
school department for many years. He
is a member of the Grand Army of the
Republic and fought In many engage
ments during the great conflict.
Â¦ My fear was that we should all be drawn
under | the cars before I had a chance to get
away. But I exerted all the strength I could
summon Into service, and I am thankful that
no one was injured.
OAKLAND, June 26.â With that rare
presence of mind born of a familiarity
with danger, Daniel Valentine, care
taker of the Franklin School and a
veteran of the Civil war, saved the
lives of three persons^ an elderly wom
an and two girls, yesterday afternoon
at Sixteenth-street depot.
The two fell off a Berkel&v local
train and were being drawn under the
wheels by the suction from the moving
cars .when Valentine, one of a number
of startled bystanders, rushed to the
rescue.
At imminent peril to himself the old
soldier jumped into the group of pros
trate children and their older com
panion and with almost superhuman
strength dragged them, one after an
other, out ofc harm's way. Valentine
narrowly escaped being caught by the
train, but he backed away after sav
ing the helpless people and suffered no
injury.
The veteran modestly hastened away
from the scene as soon as the rescued
ones were on their feet and did not
even wait to hear the grateful thanks
of the woman. He boarded a street
car for uptown and left the identity
of the trio a blank.
Valentine had gone to the baggage
room at the north end of the station
and was returning to the street car
terminus at the other end Just as a
westbound Berkeley local steamed into
the stopping place. As one car passed
Valentine he was horrified to see a
girl fall from the car steps, sprawling
helplessly on her back, so close to the
wheels that her dress was fluttering
from the air current stirred by the
car's motion. Quickly Valentine
Jumped to the prostrate child and
grabbed her. * As he did a second figure
plunged from the car. It was that of
a woman. She was followed bv a third,
a girl. The rescuer clutched at both of
them and a strong pull saved the two
just as the first one had been so quick
.y drawn out of danger. .
The train ran two car lengths after
the three had fallen, giving ample op
portunity for the crushing of all of
the victims hal not Valentine acted
as he" did. It appeared that as the
first child fell the woman lost her bal
ance in trying to save it, and, dragging
the other girl .with her, followed the
first one. Neither of the three was
more than bruised and shaken bv the
fall. â¢
Men at the station who witnessed
the rescue were strong in their praise
of the daring deed. Valentine, who re
sides at 514 East Fifteenth street, was
unwilling to say much about his heroic
act.
He deprecated the Idea of heroism,
saying:
It was an impulse that seized me when I
saw the first girl fall, and I leaped to her.
She was lying with her head within a foot of
the rails and the cars were running fast â so
fast that two of them went by before I had
completed the Job. As I grabbed the girl the
others fell and for a second or two my hands
were full. I had to brace myself against the
air suction when I got near the people, for It
was very strong.

The first attempt to establish music
as a course in the university will be
made at this session. Professor Stan
ley of the University of Michigan will
give courses in the theory and practice
of music. One of the teatures of the
work will be the organization of a
mixed chorus, trained by Professor
Stanley. A call will be issued early next
week for those who desire to enroll as
members of the chorus, which is ex
pected to give one or two concerts
in the Greek Theater before the sum
mer session. A bulletin giving com
plete information in regard to this
course will be Issued from the record
er's office on Tuesday.
A new arrangement will be made in
classifying the students in attendance
at the summer school. Instead of all
students being on an equality as here
tofore they . will be * separated under
three distinct heads, as teachers, unJ
dergraduates and graduates and au
ditors.
Hardly less important than these
men are some of the leaders of thought
coming from Eastern universities.
Among these are Reginald A. Daly,
geologist of Canada for the Interna
tional Boundary Commission; Professor
Frederick J. Turner, director of the
school of history at the University of
Wisconsin; Professor Frances B. Gum
mere, professor of English in Haver
ford College; Professor Morris H. Mor
gan, professor of classical philology at
Harvard; Professor Albert Augustus
Stanley, professor of music in the Uni
versity of Michigan; Professor Frank
M. McMurry, professor of the theory
and practice of teaching, Columbia
University; Professor Hammond La
mont, managing editor of the New
York Evening Post; Professor Charles
H. Grandgent, professor of romance
languages at Harvard University; Pro
fessor Fonger de Haan, professor of
Spanish in Bryn Mawr College, and
Professor Archibald C. Coolidge, assis
tant professor of history at Harvard.
COURSE IN MUSIC.
Instruction will be offered at- this
session by many eminent men of let
ters and science from Eastern uni
versities and Europe. Of these three
have come from across two continents
to teach â Professor Hugo de Vries,
the botanist of the University of Am
sterdam; Professor Svante August
Arrhenius, physicist of the University
of Stockholm, and Professor James
Ward, psychologist of the University
of Cambridge, England. In addition
to these great scientists there will be
Professor Jacques Loeb, the biologist
of the University of California. Sir
William Ramsay, the chemist of Uni
versity. College, England, was to have
completed this circle of scientists, but
he was compelled to send his regrets
at the last minute.
FAMOUS INSTRUCTORS.
The first function of the session will
be the general assembly of faculty and
students at 4 p. m. in Hearst Hall.
Addresses on the significance of the
summer school will be delivered by
Professor H. Morse Stephens and Pro
fessor Bernard Moses of the history
department. Professor Leon J. Rich
ardson, dean of the school, will for
mally announce its opening.
Summer school at the University of
California begins to-morrow morning.
In anticipation of the opening intend
ing students have been arriving at
every station in Berkeley to-day. The
new arrivals are expected to swell the
number Â«f students applying for ad
mission to the school by at least 200.
As there were 676 applications on file
at the hour, of closing the recorder's
olfice yesterday, indications are that
about 900 people will be attending the
session before registration closes. The
number was expected to reach 1000.
but the St. Louis Fair has drawn
many people away from the State.
Registration will go on between the
hours of 8:30 and 3 o'clock daily, so
that late comers may be accommo
dated.

general improvement of Fruitvale,
and among other things the board will

The annual pilgrimage of Landmarks
League members to the Mission San
Antonio de Padua, Monterey County,
where work of restoration is in pro
gress on the ancient sanctuary, was
this year a joy!. And the distinction
between i this â¢ year and last was that
last year the league made promisesâ
this year the promises are being made
good. And therefore was there joy in
the hearts of the simple folk for whom
the mission was reared a century since,
and a correlative Joy in the hearts of
the Landmarks people that their uphill
efforts were bearing fruit.
The league was organized in May,
1902. representatives ' from the Native
Sons, Native. Daughters, Daughters of
the California Pioneers, the California
Club, the Association of Pioneer Wo
men, the Women's Press Association,
the Society of California Pioneers, the
Young Men's Institute, the Sons of
Veteran Firemen and the Teachers'
Club responding to the invitation to
send representatives to the first meet
ing. Now, that first meeting will live
long in the memories of the . moving
spirits of that nightâ there were patri
otic speeches from noted men and wo
men, reproaches for the apathy of our
forebears in their neglect of the most
precious historic heirlooms of America
and Impassioned promises of unfalter
ing devotion to the cause until Califor
nia should no longer be reproached for
her passive crime. But, alas! impas
sioned words of their own fire are
of times consumed! That must be what
happened, because the seats of the
loudest orators, knew them no more.
But there were others â others who qui
etly walked up, signed the rolls, paid
their dollar for the year's dues (which
little formality, by the way, was quite
overlooked by the orotund orators) and
who have attended meetings, commit
tee or general, full of enthusiasm and
helpfulness without default. It is due
to them, the earnest workers, that the
objects of the league are in a fair way
to be realized. - A
On Wednesday night the league will
celebrate its second birthday as an In
corporation, on which occasion the an
nual election will take place. The meet

the cause are welcome. President

Section Hand Is Run Oover.
Harry Maloney. a section hand em

day afternoon by an excursion train.
Maloney was repairing a piece of
track at Sixteenth street, near Harri
son, and evidently did not hear the
approaching train, which was bound
for Ingleside race track. On account
of a curve in the track Engineer W.
C. Airy failed to see the unfortunate
man until the train was close upon
him, but then did all in his power to
stop the cars. Maloney died while on
the way to the City and County Hos

What think you of an Indian woman
bearing: the weight of eighty years-
Dona Perfecta Encinalâ leaving her
mountain home twenty miles above the
mission on the morning of San Antonio
day, before the first glint of sunlight
crept over the Gabalars, that she might
reach the mission in time to sweep out
the vestibule, drape it with freshly
laundered linen, and make it decent for
the great feast that was about to bÂ«
celebrated.
Her four stalwart sons, Pedro, Tito.
Felipe and Miguel, and their wives and
blinking babies came with Dona Par
fecta, all gayly clad in festival garb,
heavy laden with flowers from their
mountain home. A crown of moun
tain daisies wrought with lnflnitt care
was borne in the wrinkled fingers of
the old Indian woman for the brow of
"San Antone," and the wreath sparkled
with morning dew.
Our party, consisting of Mr. and Mrs.
Will D. Shea, Senator and Mrs. Know
land, Mrs. Lillian Ferguson, Mrs. Rath
gab and Miss Gwendolyn Powers, reach
ed the mission at sunrise, but already
had the faithful lovers of the sacred
place erected a temporary altar and
draped it with fresh linen. Behind it
stretched an Immaculate expanse of
white cloth festooned with lace, that
a shrine be made for the statue of St.
Anthony, brought from Mexico over a
century ago. While minus a few fin
gers and a toe or two â amputated, no
doubt, by relic huntersâ the statue is
in excellent condition, and is a beauti
ful specimen of wood carving of the
eighteenth century, or perhaps of an
earlier period. It is exquisitely colored
and is draped in a tinsel stuff with
which time has dealt gently. This old
statue, old* as we Americans reckon
age. is cared for from feast day to
feast day by Bob Diaz of the Macon
dray rancho, who bears It tenderly on
the great festival day from its resting
place to the shrine prepared for It.
Ah! The flowers! The scarlet
pomegranate, blooming 300 summers
in the ruined patio, graced the
background, sweet-breathed roses of
Castile smiled from the crude altar,
geraniums flashed their flame as if
challenging the promegranate â a riot
of color, a discord, perhaps, but the
scheme was born of love. And if any
power on earth can disarm criticism,
that power is sentiment. There was
no criticism in our hearts. Only won
der at the fervor.
As the service was about to be said
the Rev. Father Zephryin Englehardt
donned the brown robes of the Fran
ciscan order, of which he is a mem
ber, and the yesteryear was linked
with to-day in the presence â¢of the
cowl and gown.
For the first time since his boyhood,
handsome, old Antonio Gomez had not
the honor of serving as acolyte, the
Rev. Father Farriga making the re
sponses to his guest, the Franciscan.
The service over, the graves of the
founders of the mission were definitely
located by means of records and tes
timony, with the following result: Be
ginning at the east wall lies Fray Juan
Bautlsta Sancho, died 1830; next to
him the Rev. Dorote Ambris (the last
custodian of the mission), died 1880;
next to the west wall are the graves
of Fray Francisco Pujot y Pujot (died
in 1801) and Fray Buenaventura Sit
jar, who died in 1813. Between their
tomb and that of Father Ambris lies
Fray Serria, the martyr-priest of Sole
dad, -whose body was borne over the
mountain paths on a bier of boughs,
pine torches lighting the way, that he
might He with hi3 brethren in the
sleep eternal.
For ten years the rains have beaten
down upon the graves of these pioneers,
the winter winds hurling upon them
the rotted timbers of the vanished roof.
And the removal of this debris was no
small task. With picks and shovels the
workmen labored many days to remove
the tons of debris.
Now, fellow Callfornlans, what ex
cuse can we offer our children, and
their children's children in the years to
come. If l we fall to save for them the
noblest .historical structures in Amer
ica? What possible excuse can we fur
nish them, when the expenditure of a
little sentiment, a little energy and a
little money will preserve the most
famous of American landmarks for an
other century, or many centuries?
Let all good Callfornlans who really
want to save the missions and other
historical structures attend the annual
meeting of the Landmarks League on
Wednesday night, when new members
will be, received Into the league. The
annual dues are $1, with life member
ship at $25. i
Patriotism, my 'friends. Is bombast
unless it be made manifest h^y deeds.
Now is the time at hand for good Cali
forians to prove themselves. Another
year or two and all will be lost, and
deep will be the shame of us whose
boast Is known to be our 'love of
State." â¢Â¦â¢7 .:.Â¦â¢Â¦;:/::,'
RED 3IEX OF NORTHWEST
ENGAGE IX WEIRD RITE
Indians Gather on Mountain Top and
to Sounds of Tomtoms Perform
"Sacred" Dance.
BUTTE. Mont, June 26. â Fourteen
miles from Bptte. on the summit of
"Buffalo Hump," about 300 Indians
from all the federated tribes of the
Northwest are engaged in their annual
"sacred" dance, one of the weirdest
and strangest rites of the redskins of
the West.
With the breaking of dawn yester
day morning 100 warriors, represent
ing the Snakes, Crees, Flatheada, Chip
pewas, Shoshones and Lemhl tribes,
crouching behind long barriers of pina
brush, began a weird tooting of willow
whistles to the beating of tomtoms by
the squaws. Gradually rising to their
feet, the Indians would advance upon
one another singing the praises of
their departed braves and chanting
strange dead songs of grief for their
deceased forefathers. Ceaselessly the
Indians danced until one by one they
fell exhausted to the ground.
Other warriors, resplendent in
paint, stood In readiness and con
tinued the frantic dance. All night
long the hills and canyons abont thÂ»
hump resounded with the whoops of
the Indians and the beating of their
tomtoms.

Is a. distinguished member, ia to take
place.
Bishop Ccstamagna expressed his
fieep pleasure with the spiritual and
material life of the Italians he had met
during his week's sojourn in the city.
He BaJd he was thoroughly convinced
that in San Francisco there is large
sympathy in the church, a condition
â¢which he intends to report to the Holy
Father and the Salesian order.
He was notably pleased with the
music of the children of the parish
an<S remarked that Italians love good
music, but music, he said, must be ac
companied by the good meaning of the
heart.
The Bishop felt that if he could have
taken with him to the convention a pic
ture of the prand occasion of that af
ternoon, his colleagues would have been
as deeply impressed as himself.
He gave the highest praise to the

Kaiser, of 7676 tons, launched in 1875.
The discarded unarmored vessels are
the : Zletan, a dispatch, vessel of 975

The British Admiralty has adopted a
plan for a plentiful supply of naval
engineers which promises good results.
A limited number of supplementary
cadets will be admitted to the Royal
Naval Engineering College and given
an exceptional opportunity for train
ing in marine engineering and naval
architecture. .These students are of
fered the same advantages as the en
gineer and constructor cadets in re
spect both of the college residence and
training and of practical work in the
dockyard, without being under any ob
ligation to enter the Government serv
ice. No employment is guaranteed on
the completion of jthe training, but in
the event of vacancies occurring among
the engineer cadets an opportunity will
be given to the private students to
compete, and, if selected, they will be
eligible for commissions in the navy
under the same conditions as the en
gineer cadets. They will also be per
mitted to admission at the end of the
course to the Royal Naval â¢, College,
Greenwich.
NEW GERMAN TORPEDO-BOATS.
In the German navy six torpedo
boats, S 120 to 125, are nearly completed,
and arrangements are. being made for
building a further series of S 126 to 130.
During the present year the German
torpedo-boat fleet will number thirty
six modern first-class boats of 350 tons
and 27.5 to- 29 knots speed, and also
eighty second-class boats of 20 to 26
knots. V
The submarine boat trials are still
In progress at Portsmouth. It was
found that the boats could be captured,
or, at least, made harmless by means
of strong steel nets suspended in the
water from booms attached to speedy
vessels, and the submarine advocates
are- devising means to overcome this
defense. At the next trial the torpedo
fired from the boat will be Â¦ fitted at
its point with a scissor contrivance,
and it is believed that the rent made
will so weaken the net that it will
be unable to withstand the tearing
strain of the submarine following be
hind.
The Constellation is erroneously sup
posed to be the ' West ship afloat in any
navy, but the Victory, Nelson's flag
ship, antedated the American ship by
thirty-two years, as she was launched
May 7, 1765. Eleven ships in the Brit
ish navy have borne the name Victory,
the first one having been built
in 1560. The ship preceding the
present Victory was never heard
of after a storm in the channel
October 4, 1744, and the vessel and
complement of 1100 men, including Ad
miral Sir J. Balchen, 75 years of age,
found a watery grave. The present
Victory lay at her moorings for thir
teen years after being launched, but
from 177S up to 1812 she made up for
lost time. The termination of her
active service was coincident with
the battle of Waterloo and since
1825 she has remained in Ports
mouth harbor flying the admiral's flag.
A sham fight came off recently in the
Mediteranean between two fleets of
British ships, one, under command of
Admiral Domville and the other under
Lord Charles Beresford.- The latter
was defeated, owing to the superior
speed of his" opponent's fleet. -The dis
tance adopted by the two admirals for
closing was 2500 yards, which is Just
out of torpedo range. In order to in
sure more rapid firing of battery guns
in this intervening distance important
changes are contemplated In the ships
under construction. Supplementary
magazines and shell rooms are to be
placed as half-way houses from the
ship's magazines, immediately below
the guns' positions. The^ danger of
keeping a supply of live shells and
cartridges in the casemates and ar
mored compartments will thus be
avoided, while provision will also be
made for the most rapid shell fire. By
Captain Scott's "loader" a rapidity of
twenty-two shots in two minutes has
been attained in a 6-inch gun, equal to
the delivery of 1100 pounds of metal
from one gun in one minute.
SUBMARINE TRIALS.
The frigate Constellation has been
towed' from Norfolk -to the New York
navy yard to be thoroughly repaired.
She is the oldest â¢ ship, in the United
States navv . and was launched Sep
tember 7, 1797, being the second of six
frigates authorized bv Congress March
27, 1794. The others were the United
States, launched July 10, 1797; the Con
stitution, October 21, 1797; the Chesa
peake, President and Congress,
launched at later dates. The Constel
lation and Constitution axe the only
ones left, the others having been either
captured or destroyed,, and the two
frigates should be preserved as me
mentos of the early victories of the
navy. One hundred years ago these
two frigajtes were in the Mediterranean,
and succeeded with other ships in
breaking up the piratical depredations
of the African corsairs. While the Con
stellation is the oldest ship in the navy,
the Constitution is known throughout
the naval world for its famous fights
and interesting exploits. The Constel
lation's war record is limited to the
capture of the French frigate L'lnsur
gente and engagement with two other
French ships. She was built at Bal
timore at a cost of $314,212, and after
a commission of five years, from 1800
to 1805, was laid up for five years, then
rebuilt; commissioned in 1816, and on
intermittent cruising service until 1844.
Then the old craft had a rest of ten
years. In 1854 she was again rebuilt
at*a cost of $277,106, and after ten years'
active service became a receiving ship
at Norfolk, whence she was transferred
to the Naval Academy and served as
practice ship until 1889. In that year
the Constellation met with Its first se
rious accident, by running aground and
narrowly escaping total loss. For this
accident her commanding ofllcer was
suspended for one year. Later the ves
sel served as a stationary training ship
at Newport, and is now to be repaired,
while money has been refused for the
thorough repair of the glorious old
Constitution, now rotting at her birth
place at Boston.

"WÂ«Â» have influenced many people to
try Postum and all of them like It bet-
ter the longer they use it. and most of
them say it is better than coffee."
Name Â»rivon by Postum Co., Cattle
Creek. Mich.
Ten days' trial Postum in place of
coffee often works wonders. There's a
reason.
Look in each pkg. for the famous lit-
tle book. "The Road to Wellville.**
"My nose was constantly dripping
bloody water, but in two weeks," time
after I quit coffee and used Postum
Food Coffee in its place I could see my
way very well, the dripping from my
nose stopped and my nose flnaily got
perfectly well and healthy as far sis is
liossible for the septum to grow back.
"There is no doubt it was a case of
coffee catarrh and the cure was made
entirely by changing from coffee to
Postum. The re3t of my family took
up the new drink and Postum relieved
my wife and little boy of frequent
headaches, and what is called 'coffee
headache* Is not known in our family
any more. Our sleep is so much more
refreshing.
â¢There is no doubt coffee rave me
nasal catarrh: The septum in my nose
v. &a all gone and the catarrh was eat-
ing Its nay. getting hold of the main
bone of the nose. It also affected my
sight very much.
It Is curious how many diseases come
from a disordered nervous system
which locates disease In some part of
the body and the primary cause can
often be traced to coffee, which first
breaks down the nervous system. A

A young lady, inspired by arcadian simplicity, accepted
the other day the hospitality of a man she never had. met
before and probably will never meet again. Her trusting
confidence led her to a drinking resort, where she was
robbed. She has braved notoriety to seek redress and
in doing so has performed a public service. She has
given the young women* of San Francisco a splendid
object lesson of everything they should not be or .do.
She even may profit by her experience.

How far radium is responsible for the
heat of the earth is one of the philo
sophical questions now interesting sci
entists. Professor Rutherford before a
recent meeting of the Royal Institution
of London stated that he believed tbe
amount of radium present and uni
formly distributed throughout the earth
would be sufficient .to account for all
the heat lost from that body. In this
event the cooling of the earth, so that
ultimately it would becom uninhabit
able, as was calculated by Lord Kelvin,
would be postponed, and a few million
more years would Jbe afforded for the
various forms of animal life. Such a
possibility was anticipated doubtless
by Lord Kelvin himself, for in his cal
culations he Inserted ! "provided no hew
form of heat is discovered.", This is
now held to exist in the minute, quan
tities of radium which " are widely and
universally distributed over the earth
and which may account for! the gradual
increase of temperature as the interior
of the earth is ' approached.â Harper's

'Answers to Queries.
President Harper of the University
of Chicago argues trenchantly in the
World To-Day for July for higher pay
for teachers ia elementary and sec
ondary schools. He says:
"The demands of the work can bÂ«
met only by those whom nature has
endowed with a high order of talent.
The teacher to whom is intrusted the
fostering care of our children should
surely be one whose ability we re
spect. How is it possible to satisfy
the conscience If a policy other than
this prevails? Is there anything more
precious than the child, whether
viewed from the point of ,vlew of the
family or the state? Is not his train
ing a thing of pre-eminent impor
tance? And yet we are* willing to
pay to his teacher a salary far less
than is paid in many cases to the
keeper of our horses, or to the keeper
of our cattle. Who can not see the
utter absurdity of this? The teacher,
everything considered, should be, and
in man^cases Is, the equal of the man
or woman who enters into any other
professional life. Shall we stultify
ourselves by continuing to pay the
teacher at a rate which places on
him or her the brand of intellectual
weakness for having accepted a posi
tion which promises its occupant so
little profit or advantage? The time
has come when preparation for teach
ing even in the grades requires a
preparation and a proficiency equal to
that demanded by any other" profes
sion. These requirements have grad
ually been ' increased until to-day In
many quarters only those possessed of
a vigorous physical constitution,
strong and untiring purpose, and in
addition a considerable sum of money,
are able to .secure the preparation
called for. Is it justice to those who
have pursued this laborious course of
preparation that in the end they
should find themselves limited to a
salary so small as to seem pitiful in
view of the hardship undergone and
the expense which has . been in
curred?"
Teachers' Salaries.
PUT all fear behind you when you lick a postage
stamp nowadays. There is no danger of poison
whatever. You will be as safe as when at home
you are engaged in licking your spoon after a dish of
ice-cream. For word comes ' from Washington that
cassava starch, 1 more popularly known as tapioca, is the
chiefs element of the gum on the back of all postage
stamps. Think of it, tapiocaâ that toothsome pudding
maker found in the pantry of almost every household in
the land!
The announcement from Washington is likely to pro
duce a boom in tapioca and at the same time, Uncle
Sam, prosperous though he be, may revel in greater
prosperity by reason of the fact that the Postoffice De
partment will enjoy a wonderfully increased business.
The whole country has a sweet tooth and 'the postage
stamp with its tapioca back js about the most alluring
article that can be purchased for little money and car
ried around with the least inconvenience.
When the desire for something sweet overcomes us all
that will be necessary will be to reach into our purse,
wallet or vest-pocket, take out a stampj or two and lick
to bur heart's content. Of course some men will prefer
to lick" 1 two-cent stamps, but one could get just as much
satisfaction, or, to be more accurate, just as much tapi
oca from one-centers. Probably it will suit those plenti
fully endowed with this world's goods to do their licking
with five and ten cent stamps. However, everybody to
his taste.
Tapioca is a very nutritious farinaceous food, and it is
reasonable to suppose the busy man who. will not permit
himself to get away from his place, of business for his
midday luncheon will be making a, meal hereafter from
his tapioca-backed postage stamps: Th'ese will be kept
under lock and' key in his office, as it will be safe no
longer, in view of the tapioca announcement sent broad
cast from the national capital, to leave the precious
stamps loosely around. The office boys and typewriter
maids may be tempted to use them as dessert to lunches
hastily taken 'in nearby hasheries.
The Government is to be heartily thanked for the
gratifying information It has* given out and the relief ft
has caused, for there is no denying that we have always
had visions of poison every time we have licked a stamp.
Nobody can justly complain about our Government. It
is all: right.. And as far as the Postoffice Department is
concerned, it .will now become more popular with the
people, who will point to it and say: "See, we have found
another pudding."/-^ V^
POSTAGE STAMP TAPIOCA.
The Supreme Court has decided that no woman may
be sold liquor in a saloon in San Diego on the broad
and thoroughly intelligent ground that a saloon-keeper
may not legally dispense intoxicants to persons of bad
character in the town. It was hardly necessary, how
ever, to receive the support of the most dignified tribunal
in the State to declare that any woman who seeks a
drink in a saloon is by that very seeking a bad char
acter. /
Oh, the nursery is lonely, and the gar
den's full of rain.
And there's nobody at all who wants
to play.
But I think if I should run with all
my might and main
I could leave this dreary country of
To-day.
For it can't be far to cross it, since I
came myself last nightâ
When I went to sleep they brought me
all the wayâ v \ ~~ '
Arid To-morrow's very near, they say it's
almost in our sisfct.
So I soon could come again to Tester
day.
Over there my boat is sailing, all alone
. upon the pond â
I must hurry back before she blows
astray;
And arbutus flowers are trailing In the
pleasant fields beyond.
With the other little, lovely flowers of
May.
And the trees are white with blossoms,
and the air is bright with song.
And the children all are happy there
and gay.
Oh. I want to go to find them now, and
you may come along.
If you'll show me, please, the road to

The Road to Yesterday.
"The national talent of acquisitive
ness, one of the most conspicuous pro
ducts of our educational system â when
directed toward the study of art â has
'awakened thousands of people to the
appreciation of the role which art
should play ln^ life." say3 Charles H.
Caffin in the" July World's Work.
"Countless homes reflect this in a
greater propriety of decoration and fur
nishing than formerly, and from the
home it has passed into the street.
Churches, hotels, theaters and of
ce buildings are being erected
on all sides with at least a
consideration for beauty of de
sign and flttmgs. Commerce employs
this element of beauty to enhance Its
own dignity and importance, and has
discovered in it an asset not to be ig
nored. Even a" regard for that larger
element of design, which Includes the
planning of total effects, has begun to
penetrate the public consciousness. At
the Chicago Exposition it was seen how
a concentration of effect and a union
of similarity with difference conduced
to the grandeur of the scene. And this
new development of civic pride has
reached right up to the top and effected
a complete change In the attitude of
the national Government toward the
erection of federal buildings. A thor
oughly trained supervising architect,
with a corps of first-class assistants,
and the substitution of public competi
tion for political influence have result
ed of late years In an extraordinary
improvement In the character of these
buildings. They are signal examples of
the way In which the wealth and power
of the country is expressing itself
through artistic means."

One seldom hears of what is probably
the largest and oldestâ and to Western
eyes the oddestâ university in the
world. El-Azhar, "the splendid," at
Cairo, Egypt While the dates of the
founding of the, universities of Oxford,
Paris and Bologna, for which great
antiquity is claimed, are lost In the
mists of the Middle Ages, El-Azhar can
read its title clear from the year 975
A. D. Constantinople is the official head
of the Mohammedan religion, but the
summit of Mussulman learning may be
secured only at El-Azhar. Thither flock
from every land owning Mahomet as Its
religious guide -those of all ages who
would be proficient in the Koran and
other branches of Oriental learning.
More than 10,000 students, according to
Frederic Courtland Penfleld. formerly
United States diplomatic agent and
Consul General at Cairo, who has de
scribed the university in his book,
'Present Day Egypt." sit at the feet of
the instructors about the pillars.
The oddity of the university is mani
fested at the first glimpse of the build
ing which houses it. The restorations
have been too numerous to leave any
Indication of the original structure, but
there is no doubt of its relation to
Mohammedanism, for lofty minaret* of
Oriental type rise here and there. Lit
tle can be seen of the exterior, how
ever, for it is closely surrounded by
buildings. Within is a court, the sky
its only roof. On each side are alcoves
covered by roofs supported by pillars.
The porticos about the enormous open
ccurt are each divided into various
compartments for the separate use of
the students of the different nations.
The Algerian students^have one, - the
Moroccans another, . the Nubians a
third, the Turks another and the In
dians still another, and so on. The dif
ferent sections of Egypt each have a
separate compartment; those who come
from the testing place of the bones of
Mahomet â Mecca â are also provided
with a section; the blind pupils,
strangely more fanatical and turbulent
than the average Mussulman, also find
special accommodation for themselves.
Although only a drive of a few min
utes from the hotel district, compara
tively few foreigners take the 'trouble
to visit the strange educational insti
tution. Many are unaware of its in

Passing a number of students who are
having their heads shaved eo closely
that they look like a French wig-mak

interior of the building. Students and
masters who are entering are remov
ing their shoes at the threshold. Here
and there at the foot of the pillars are
seated the "professors" on rugs of
sheepskin, discoursing to groups of
students squatting in a half circle
about them. The pupils are listening
intently. Discussions of different
themes are going on. Not a student
turns to look at the visitor, so Inter
ested is he in the discussion. The cov

ported by 300 marble pillars and each
of the instructors has his particular

It chanced that Madame Blavatsky,
the High Priestess of the Theosoph
ists, paid a visit to the house one day.
On crossing the threshold her manner
became greatly perturbed and she told
her hostess that there was some strong,
malignant Influence In the houee and
requested permission to examine the
various rooms. When she discovered
the coffin lid ehe -declared it to be a
most dangerous possession and be
sought its owner to send it away forth
with. This the lady laughingly refused
to do, attributing Madame Blavatsky's
fears to foolish superstition.
Shortly after this, however, she sent
the case to a Baker street studio io be
photographed and. as already told,' the
photographer discovered that his cam
era had reproduced the features of an
apparently living woman.. Shortly af
terward he died suddenly and myste
riously. Soon after, this happened Mr.

One evening an Arab, who said he
had been sent by Mustapha Aga,
called upon a member of the then happy
little party â Mr. D. he is. called to con
ceal his identity â and offered to sell
Slim a beautiful mummy case, which
be declared he had just found. It was
the priestess' mummy case, which has
now found a final resting place in the
British Museum. By what sacrileg
ious means the Arab obtained posses
sion of it, or what became of the
mummy, is not known. Mr. D. bought
It. But as all the members of the
party were keen Egyptologists it had
been decided that the ownership of
their respective finds should be deter
mined by lot and thus it came about
that the mummy case fell into the
bands of Mr. W.
It was on the return Journey that the
series of misfortunes so strangely as
sociated with It began. "While one of
Mr. D's servants was handling a gun
it exploded in some unaccountable man
ner, the charge lodging in the man's
arm which had to be amputated. A
eecond servant died In poverty within
the year and a third was shot. When
Cairo was reached Mr. W. discovered
that he had lost the larger portion of
his fortune. Entertaining no suspicion
that the mummy-case was in any way
connected with his financial troubles,
or tbe mishaps which had attended the
party since it was acquired, he gave
it to a married sister living near Lon
don- Soon afterward he died. Â» But
from the day that the effigy of the
dead priestess entered its new abode
tnisf 01 tune dogged the footsteps of the
family living there.
Robinson declares that he has care
fully investigated the evidence of the
afflictions which have befallen those
who had the misfortune to incur the
enmity of this Egyptian priestress who
died 3500 years ago, and says he has
obtained abundant proof of the truth
â¢f the statements made to him,
though, fori the sake of the friends,
and relatives of her victims he has
suppressed their names in his narra
tive.
It was in the middle of the f 60*s
that a party of five friends chartered
a. dahabia for a voyage up the Nile
and tarried at Luxor to explore the
ruins of Thebes and the famed temple
to Amen Ra, which, even in its decay
and desolation, is still probably the
most sublime monument of antiquity
existing. The members of the party
were entertained at dinner by Lady

"HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL.
f HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON, June 13.â Few
tales of occult fiction have been more
extraordinary than the weird story of
B- mummy case at the British Museum
fcnd its supposed death-dealing powers,
Â»rhlch has just been told by B.
Fletcher Robinson in & London news
paper. The narrative's truth, how
ever. Is vouched for by the writer,
frrho, *>eÂ»ldes being the intimate friend
fcf Sir A. Conan Doyle, Is & newspaper
fcaaji of much repute.
There Is a painted cover of the
taummy case, which now is reposing
fa a corner of the first Egyptian room
Â©f the museum, but which once cover
fed the embalmed remains of a priest
fess of the College of Amen Ra, and
Jtrho lived in the mighty city of Thebes
tome 1600 years before Christ. The
Â¦work Is still in a beautiful state of
{preservation and depicts a woman of
elngul&rly baleful expresssion, whose
dark eyes Etare into vacancy, as
though seeking there some clew to the
riddle of the universe, while her hands
ere peacefully crossed upon her breast.
A remarkable circumstance was the
result of a London photographer's at
tempt to obtain a picture of the
strange face 6hown on the coffin lid.
To the man's amazement, when a print
was taken from the negative It re
vealed not a dead face but apparently
a living one, with wide open eyes, and
the baleful expression of the painted
eSgy heightened to one of intense
malignancy.
It was Fletcher Robinson, readers
may remember, to whom Dr. Doyle
publicly acknowledged his indebtedness
for the plot of his "Hound of the Bas
kervilles." Until recently, too, the teller
of the following tale was editor of the
London Express, which he left t3 as

"Yes. this will do! But how my back
does ache! I mustn't delay a minute!
Is anybody looking? Here goes, then;
and may I never have to move again!"
In the twinkling of an eye the caudal
hooks let go their hold deep in the spiral
of the old shell and have safely anchor
ed the weak and flaccid body to the
inner convolutions of the new one.
It Is all over; an empty shell lies on
the sand and a larger one is near it
with a sleepy-looking hermit crab In
it. Poke him, and he leans languidly
out over his pearly balcony as If to
say, "If this deadly monotony Is not
broken soon I shall die!"
But, behind this "society mask." the
cramped muscles are stretching oat and
adjusting themselves in absolute con
tentment to the roomy spaces offered
them.
Finding no empty shell of suitable
size, the hermit may be driven to ask
a brother hermit to vacate in his favor.
The proposition is spurned indignantly,
and a fight ensues. The battle Is to
the stronger. Often the attacking party
has considerable trouble in cleaning out
the, shell, having to pdck his adversary
ou^ in bits. A periwinkle or a whelk
may be attacked in a like manner by a
hermit who is hard pressed and has
taken a fancy to that particular shell.
If the householder be feeble the con
quest is easy. If lusty, he holds the
fort.
At last the search Is over. The shell
is cleaned and ready.
him that the shell he considers "dis
tinctly possible," and hopefully ven
tures to explore, is already occupied by
a near but coldly unsympathetic rela

The details of this new departure on the part of the
agriculture authorities as announced in a recent bulletin
are these: Those whose circumstances prevent attend
ance upon the regular courses in agriculture at the uni
versity have only to communicate with the director of
the university extension in agriculture at Berkeley and
by him be enrolled in 3 reading course in one or more
of the subjects offered. To this scholar in absentia there
will be forwarded a set of bulletins dealing progressively
with the subject in hand and calculated to impart as
perfect a knowledge of the science as could be obtained
without the aid of laboratory practice. To supplement
this training a circulating library of reference books' is
open to him and constant communication with the in
structors at Berkeley upon knotty problems in the study
is always "his privilege. Should the student upon the
successful completion of his^course desire entrance to
the university Ije will be given advanced standing in the
science in question.
By this brief outline of the new scheme adopted by
the agriculture department of the State University it
may be seen that for every fruit raiser, grain grower*and
stock breeder in. the State there lie open added facilities
for the perfection of method' and achievement of prime
results in their endeavor. Already the scientists' from
Berkeley, who travel the length of California in pur
suance of the farmers' institute work, have come into
close alliance with those who put their theories into suc
cessful practice. Co-operative experiments conducted by
the farmers and the university professors in conjunction
serve to bring- theory and practice into closer inter
dependence. This last innovation opens to the agri
culturists of the State the opportunity to make the in
fluence: of the trained specialists at the university a fac
tor in the balance of a successful tilling of the soil
wherever the mails carry.
THE already very efficient department of agricul
ture at the University; of California has inaugu
rated-an innovation in the conduct of its university
extension courses, "which must be productive of ines
timable benefit to the agriculturists of the State who rely
so strongly upon the counsel that comes to them from
the experts at Berkeley. To the work now being done
by the State experiment station across the bay and by
the extension coursesconducted under the auspices of
the university there has been added a department for the
preparation and dissemination of reading courses upon
technical subjects of agricultural science.
A CHANCE FOR AGRICULTURISTS.
, A young forger was sentenced by the United States
District Court the other day to imprisonment until he
shall have paid a fine of five hundred dollars levied
upon his unworthy self by the trial Judge. This un
comfortably indefinite future in durance vile may, as it
surely should, have a deterring influence upon other gay
young spirits not to commit crime. By forcing criminals
â¢to begin a career of dishonesty on a cash basis we will
probably diminish the supply of the evil-minded.
She most graciously thanked hlm
"I am glad to meet a gentleman," said
she. The young bloods sniggered but
said not a word. The young ladies
blushed and also remained still. All
felt the sting hurled at them.
Next morning when the stage ar
rived to convey such as wished to
return to the city, the old lady was
waiting with her trunk on the porch.
She stepped out from among the rest
and inquired for Tom, the hired man.
He came, and removing his hat stood
before her. She handed him an en
velope and thanked him for his kind
ness and exhibition of good breeding
on the previous day/ When -Tom
stepped to one side and opened the
envelope he found two twenty and
one ten-dollar notes with this line on
note paper: "Though only a servant,
yet a gentleman."
While this was going on an elderly
lady with white hair and a sweet face
strolled down on the piazza in search
of a quiet place where she could read
a book. She looked about but there
was no seat. She evidently expected
that one of the many young gentle
men would be gallant enough to pass
her one of the seats they used for
footrests. But none offered. Just
then a hired man, carrying a coaloll
can, into which he was stuffing waste
paper and other refuse strewn about
the walks, passed by. - He set the
coaloil can down, walked Into the
dining-room and returned with a chair
which he politely set down for the
old lady.
It was at one of the summer resorts
not over 100 miles from this city that
an assemblage of San Francisco's
young people were recently enjoying
themselves. It was on a Sunday
afternoon shortly after the arrival of
the morning train which brought
with it quite a lot of young blood3
from the city. .They had wealth and
education, and had come to display
the former at least before theft- young
lady acquaintances. Just beneath a
bunch of honeysuckles and other
creeping vines ,on the piaza a party
of them, lolling In chairs, exchanged
Jokes and repartee of the latest coin
age. The few vacant chairs that re
mained were used by some of th*
young gentlemen who gracefully
stretched their limbs upon them,
showing thereby the latest designs in
footwear-
r A Gentleman.
Now, apparently, the misfortunes
â¢which have heretofore attended the
possession of the mummy-case have
ceased. The learned gentlemen who
preside over the room in which it rests
have not "been troubled by its presence.
It may be that finding herself among
queens and princesses and dignitaries
of equal rank, with a card setting
forth her various claims to distinction,
the Priestess of Amen Ra no longer
makes use of the malign powers which
she possesses. .
"It Is certain," writes Mr. Robinson,
"that -the Egyptians had powers which
we in the twentieth century may laugh
at, yet can never understand. There
is, for instance, a recorded case of an
explorer who carried off a coffin on
which was engraved the threat that if
the man therein burled was disturbed
by any thief of the graves, the body of
that thief would be scattered in his
death. The explorer laughed, for he
was not, he was pleased to say, of a
superstitious nature; yet soon after
ward he was torn to pieces by an ele
phant when shooting."
learned ojf the misfortunes that had be
fallen her family since It came Into
her possession. He urged her to get
rid of It at once and, convinced at last
that the thing was a terrible "hoodoo,"/
she agreed. A carrier was found to
transport It to the British Museum.
He died withi|i a week and the man
who assisted him in removing It to the
museum buildings met with a serious
accident.
THE better tone to trade noted a week or so ago
was even more pronounced last week and it really
appeared as if business were improving. If a com
mercial reaction should set in now it would be rather
surprising, for such reactions rarely occur in midsum
mer, though it may prove a mere fluctuation. But the
signs all along the line are better. First, the loss in
bank clearings, which has lately ranged from 15 to 25
per cent, has fallen to 4.9 per cent for the week just
passed, and the aggregate clearings were $1,800,000,000.
The failures, too, made a more favorable exhibit,* being
227, against 223 for the corresponding week in 1903.
Another cheering indication was an increase in railway
earnings, the record thus, far in June showing an actual
gain of 4.2 per cent over last year. For some months
past these railway earnings have steadily exhibited a de
crease compared with 1003. -Â¦^X--'
Thus, as far as the usual figures by which the con
dition of the commerce- of the country is estimated and
which may be called the pulse of trade, arc concerned,
tlie business situation is showing not only more tone, but
more activity than for some months. There is no ques
tion that the feeling in New York is decidedly bullish,
especially among the great banking interests and the
leading Wall street operators. The , stock market for
th*- past fortnight has been acting like a captive balloon,
which sways in a buoyant arc and tugs at its ropes in a
persistent attempt to soar away from the earth and seek
the skies. From all quarters in Wall street come: multi
plying reports of increasing confidence, a desire to in
vest in standard bonds arid a general disposition to take
a sanguine view of the trade outlook.
In this connection the Wall Street Journal says: "The
bond market has been practically cleared up of bonds in
first ham'.s, except for a portion of the last New York
City issue and a portion of the Lake Shore debenture
issue. The demand at present is showing indications of
passing into bonds of a slightly lower grade. _Bond
houses say that if they could get absolutely first-class
material theygcould do a large business. There is no
sign, however, of any fiesh material at this moment,
and it is not thought likely that there will be any new
bond issues for quite a while. The Head of one large
banking house says that not in years has there been so
good a demand for first-class bonds as there is now.
There has-tten a great restoration of confidence on the
part of investors in this class of security."
The general view of the business situation as far as
the city* of New York is concerned is this: That with
money in oversupply at anywhere from 1 to 3 per cent
and pressing on the market for an advantageous outlet,
with plenty of standard stocks paying from 3 to 5 per
cent going begging .for purchasers and crop conditions
which are practically perfect, it will be impossible to
keep the stock market down for any extended period.
These conditions will surely force the apathy to give
way. Money is not going to lie idle forever when it can
be borrowed at say 2VJ'per cent and put into invest
ments paying 4% to 5 per cent. Such a situation would
be absurd on 'its face. And when that money breaks
loose from the timid custodians who are holding it back
and emerges into the arena as an active and buoyant
force there will be a market and a good one.
It is noteworthy how many astute financiers, veterans
in Wall street, take this view, and it will be interesting
to watch the course of, the market for a few weeks and
see how far this sanguine forecast will be verified. It
may be that the wish is father to the thought, but, be
this as it may, the feeling in the country's metropolis is
undeniably much better than for months, and further
more is getting better right along.
There are other favorable signs wfiich have cropped
out within the past month. Provisions are much more
active at the important Western centers and prices have
lately been decidedly firm. Many cities, large and small,
are reporting a better jobbing demand for general mer
chandise and a larger distribution of staple goods. This
improved demand, coming in midsummer, is very en
couraging, though, of course, nobody knows how long it
will last.
Just what causes this general better feeling all along
the line of trade is not known.: It may be, as said be
fore, a mere fluctuation, to be followed later on by an
other recession and period of dullness; a transient
activity due to the replenishing of depleted stocks or to
the simplicity and clearness of the political outlook,
which is something unusual and decidedly refreshing in
a Presidential year. It may be the brilliant crop pros
pects, which almost insure at least fair times for the
American farmÂ«r for another year; it may be the belief,
which is becoming crystallized, that there will be no
serious disturbance by the coming election of the cur
rent settled conditions of finance and trade for an in
definite* period ahead; or it may be that more or less idle
money is already forcing itself into active circulation.
Any or all of these conditions may be at the root of the
current improvement.
Still there are drawbacks. The lumber trade is de
pressed all over the country as a rule. The iron and
steel trade, too, is dull and unsatisfactory, though a dis
patch from Wall street on Saturday said that an im
provement was slowly extending in the industry and
that a better feeling would also. soon appear, in the dry
goods markets. Hides and are losing the
activity which has heretofore characterized them and'
the tanners are taking no more hides than they can help.
The wheat exports are much less than those of last year,
those for last week being only 1,271,000 bushels, against
3,158,000 for the corresponding week in 1903, while from
July. 1, 1903, to date they amount to only 132,727,000
bushels, against 220,200,000 last season and 244,143,000 in
TjKJa. Partially offsetting this loss, however, is the state
ment that the United States is falling back as a great
wheat exporter, as it needs more of its wheat than for
merly to feed, its rapidly increasing population.
On this coast trade is quieter than it has been and in
this city complaints of inactivity have been more numer
ous of late. We may be getting the edge of the wave of
dullness which has been slowly rolling westward across
the continent, or the present quietude may be merely
the usual midsummer lull, for thousands of people are
out of town on their summer vacations; but the tendency
is to report business decidedly quieter* without, however,
any disturbing elements or any disposition to croak. We
are naturally affected by conditions in the other, parts
of the country, though our." position as a source of sup
ply for the great markets of the Orient, which have been
drawing on us for various lines of produce and mer
chandise for a number of years/operates to keep us from
experiencing the more accentuated^Jorms of business
depression. As long as we havethe South Pacific,
northern coast and Oriental markets calling on us for
goods we can never experience the real acute conditions
which occur in the East at regular intervals. Dull we
may be for a time, but stagnant probably never.

According to the Redding Free Press
the first fruit cannery to be establish
ed in Shasta County is meeting: with
I marked success. The Free Press says:
The Happy Valley Fruit Growers' Assocla
| tion cannery at Ohnda will be idle for a day
or to until a now dock cf cans can be received.
! The cannery has put up and disposed of 4000
1 cons of strawberries, blackberries and straw
berry Ji*Ri this season and will send out more
than treble that number. The cannery has
been a greater success than even the members
of the association anticipated, and these few
I people who predicted that a cannery could not
1 be maintained in Shasta County are more than
' surprised.
About 1400 cans cf strawberry jam has been
J put up and people who have rampled it pro
1 ncunce it better than any that can be i ro
j cured elsewhere. The cannery will at once be-
I gin operations on a big special order for the
I Wcatovcr L.umber Company. That onier will
{ reach well up into the thousands of cans. The
association will not confine ltxelf to berries.
I Jukt aa soon as the berry season is over
peaches, pears and all kinds of fruit will be
put up. Next season the cannery will be en
larged.
Shasta County Opens First Cannery
and Result Better Than Anticipated.

of win:* last year from this section waa 1.047, V
156 gallons. This wine is all of an extra fine"
quality.
Cradled in sunshine and verdure, at an ele
vation of 4f* feet, and surrounded by rolling
hills, lies the prosperous and progressive Plcas
anton Valley. It Is an excellent health resort.
Its equable, semi-tropical climate is especially
beneficial to those suffering from asthmatic or
more catarrhal troubles. Pieasanton is located
in &n artesian water belt and has one of the
I finest wattr systems in the country. In addi

SOME VAST HOP YARDS.
The Pieasanton hopyards are the largest hop
yards under one wlmk.ln the world. Over 16,-
COO.oCO pounds of cable and trellis wire are
ueÂ«d for the network that spans the 20-foot
poles to puatain the weight of the full grown
vines. Twenty thousand pounds of cotton
twine annually are required for the training of
the vlties. The water supply of the valley is
grester than the tewn has been able to utilize.
. Cultivation of the land, together with ita at
tendant -vocations,- creates sufficient employ

Contested Game of Gaelic Football.
A crowd which packed grand stand
and bleachers at the Presidio Athletic
Grounds yesterday witnessed an excel
lent game of Gaelic football between
the Parnells and the Occidentals' pick
ed teams of the Gaelic League and the
Scotch organizations. So evenly match
ed were the Jteams that neither side
was able to *tnake a clean goal, al
though the ball remained within the
lines of the Parnells during the greater
portion of both halves.
During the second half two of tho
players were knocked out temporarily,
but managed to recuperate and resuire
their positions without leaving the field.
An altercation between one cf th3
judges and a player toward the close
of the game caused a scrimmage which
threatened to be serious, but was
smoothed over with no damage done.
The teams were made up as follows:
Occidentalsâ Fay. Lyilon. Shand E. Fay.
Taylor. Smith. P, Far. Lees, Otarner. Turner.
HarwfKxl. Mathespn. McGraw, Michaels. Rush
ton. . McCarthy. Taylor.
Parnells^ â Barrett. Curran, J. Murphv.
O'Brien. Allen. Barry. Corkery. Ryan Sullivan

The ."Wisconsin eight and four ap
peared on the river at 6 o'clock to-night
and paddled along the river front a

crews rested.
.To-morrow all will take their last
practice before the races on Tuesday.
Coach Courtney said to-nlRht that
the two substitutes brought from Itha
ca are not in shape for the race, and
that he has no alternative but to have
two of his men row in both the varsity
and four-oared races. The men selected
for this task are Edward Foote. who
was trained to stroke the four, and his
cousin, George Foote, who rows No. 4
in the big eight. Besides Coffin, Forbes
of he varsity four is ill and George
Foote will take his place.

Captain Coffin of the Cornell crew, ac
companied by Manager Alrich, came to
this city to-day and entered a private
sanitarium, where he is in bed with
fever. His trouble is nothing more se
rious than malaria, but hia condition ia
such that it will be some time before
he can cleave the hospital. Coffin
stroked the victorious Cornell eight
last year. He stroked the crew the
early part of this year and was regard

Mrs. Quinn at first refused to discuss
the publication that has subjected her
to much humiliation, but she finally
said:
Charlie and I went from San Francisco di
rect to Chicagoi. The first two weeks -ther*
we spent at the Auditorium, Annex and then*
moved Into a flat at 5731 Madron avenue, w Â»
Intended to spend the summer there and re
turn to San Francisco next wtnter. We werÂ»
nevÂ»r near St. Louis. My ohject In comlnjr
back here now Is to right the wrong that has
been done me. I think this Is due to my fam
ily and friends. aÂ« well as myself.
So far from there ever having been any
trouble between my husband and myself, tfi*
truth Is that wo have never had a cross woni
during our married life. We are most happy
together, I assure you.
Referring to the possibility of his
bringing an action for libel against
those responsible for the story. Quinn
said he was not ready to make a state
ment on that subject, but he added
that thsre was a purpose In his hurried
trip with his wife to San Francisco and
that he would probably make it known
in a few days.
In Chicago I have- a host of friends, among
them many prominent men. any of whom
could have quickly disproved any rumor or
suspicion that my wife and I had separated
or that she was Involved in any disagreeable
affair In St. Louis, for they all knew that wÂ»
were living happily In Chicago and; werÂ«
dally seen together at hoteK places of amuse
ment and .on the main thoroughfares. la
this city relatives of my wife discredited thÂ»
story published from St. Louis, but the paper
that printed It refused to heed their denials.
The friends of Charles J. Quinn, the
well-known young horsemen, whose
wife, formerly Miss. Mabel K. Hopkins
of this city, w.as recently made the ob
ject of a bitter attack in connection
with a sensational story from St. Louis,
are curious as to what action he pur
poses to take to refute the charses pub
lished against her. Since his arrival
here Saturday night Quinn has been in
consultation with a member of a lead-
Ing local legal firm, and it is generally
understood that he will carry the mat
ter into the courts in a few days.
"When seen at his apartments at the
St. Francis last evening Quinn. in the
presence of his young wife and her
mother, who have not wholly recovered
from the shock of the notoriety thrust
upon Mrs. Quinn, said that he was not
yet prepared to discuss for publication
his proposed plan of action, but he add
ed that he would not permit the. unjus
tifiable attack on his wife to pass un
heeded. The confounding of his wife
with a woman of a similar name who
attempted suicide in St. Louis a week
ago Quinn Insists was the result of in
excusable carelessness. lift said:
Mrs. Quinn and I left San Francisco early In
May for Chicago, where we have been llvlns
ever since. It ts hard for us to conceive hovr
cur names should have been Â¦ connected with
the rtory. Wf could easily have been found ia
Chicago at any time. As soon as I was ad
vised of the slanderous stcrry I ImmerUafly
placed myself In communication with frienda
tn St. Louis and had no difficulty in establish
ing tha Identity of the real woman In the ca.-Â»Â«
and all the facts connected with her family:

They an> suggestions to the Legislature,
which we think are all that can be made by a
body like the road convention, and even if
adopted by the Legislature - It would remain
for that body, containing representatives from
all parts of the State to provide details and
make a harmonious law of it. adapted to all
parts of our great State. Respectfully sub
mitted,
THEODORK WAGXER (Chairman).

Eighth â That for the purpose of gradually
bringing existing roads to the standards and
requirements adopted the law requtre a certain
minimum proportion of road funds colle<ied to
be expended only for permanent Improvement
thereon until such roads are brought up to
such standards.
These are the fundamental features of a
new road law which we recommend.
Third â That local roads shall be under thÂ«
control of a board of three trustees In each
road district, elected as school trustees are
now elected, who shall employ a road overseer
for su;h district In a similar manner as school
trustees employ a teacher.
The construction, repair and maintenance
of! local roads shall be under the Immediate
control of the road trustees and overseers of
the several road districts under the treneral
supervision of the County Board of Road Com
missioners and County Road Superintendent.
For the construction, repair and maintenance
of local roads, local taxes shall bo levied and
collected In the respective districts uvxin esti
mates furulslK-d by such local trustees within
the limits to be prescribed by law.
Fourtli â That there shall be in each county
a County Board of Road Commissioners and
a County Road Superintendent, who must be
a properly qualified civil engineer.
That such County Road Commissioners bÂ«
elected by the qualified electors of the county
at large, and that those first elected shall
hold otflvs for two, four and six years, re
spectively, and thereafter one to be elected at
each general election and hold office for six
years, and that the County Road Superintend
ent shall be elected by the Board of Super
visors in each county.
Fifth â That- such County Board of Road
Commissioners shall have jurisdiction over all
matters relating to the construction, repair
and maintenance of the general county roads
and standard and State aided roads and that
they and the county road superintendent shall
exercise a supervisory control over the local
road trustees and over the expendituros for
local roads In a similar manner as the County
Board of Education and school superintendent
supervise th? local school trustees.
Sixth â That general county roads and stand
ard or State aided reads shall be constructed
and maintained by taxation of all the tax
able property In the county as a whole. In
cluding that In cities and incorporated towns,
and that the State shall contribute from the
State treasury a certain sum per mile an
nually for the maintenance of such roads
when constructed according to prescribed State
standards and requirements and when such
roads have been accepted by the State as
constructed according to tho requirements pro- '
vided by law, mich State aid to cease when
ever said reads are not maintained accord-
Ing to such standards and requirements. That
the State shall pay for thÂ« construction, re
pair and maintenance of all streets or public
roeds fronting upon or passing through State
property.
Seventh â That all work on general county
roads and standard or State aided roads, either
construction, rer>alr or maintenance, shall be
done by contract, under proper safeguards ami
restrictions, and shall be let to the lowest and
best bidder, and that for the purpose of repair
and maintenance such roads shall be divided
lutof convenient sections.
All cuch regulations to be published. io as to
be In the hands of all officials. Includtng local
trustees and road overseers and citizens gen
erally, anil that no public money shall be ex
pended except In accordance with such regula
tions and standards.
First â Classification of public roads Into
local roads, general county roads and stand
ard county roads receiving State aid.
Secondâ That the State law shall prescribe
general regulations and standards for the con
struction, repair and maintenance of local and
general county roads and authorize and re
quire the Boajd of Supervisors In each countv
to provide further general regulations and
standards within the limits allowed by State
law for such construction, repair and main
tenance within each county, anil that the State
law shall prescribe all regulations and stand
ards for the construction, repair and main
tenance of standard county roads receiving
State aid.
The committee discusses the present
road laws at length and shows that
under its provisions good uniform
roads are an impossibility; it shows
that under the law as it stands the dis
tricts having the most road mileage
and most difficult roads to construct
and maintain have the least income,
while these of less mileage and in more
level and thickly populated country,
where the expense of building and
maintaining roads is least, have the
most money, and that to overcome
present evils a classification of roads
into local roads and general roads ft a
necessity.
The report emphasizes the fact that
under present laws each roadmaster
works his roads according to his own
ideas, which are often very crude. The
provisions recommended by the com
mittee are designed to eliminate poli
tics from road matters and put their
construction and maintenance upon a
business basis. The report follows:
GLEN ELLEN, June 26.â The com
mittee appointed by the road conven
tion held at Glen Ellen on April 30 pre
sented its report to the Dunbar Im
provement Club at the meeting of the
club Saturday last.
Tjhe introductory sections of the re
port contain information regarding the
defects in the present road law, and
clearly and at length explains how
such defects may be remedied.
The report embodies many of the
best suggestions offered at the county
road convention referred to, the main
feature â the classification of roads â be
ing put forward b> Theodore Wagner,
chairman of the committee^ to which
was assigned the work of preparing
from the various drafts offered the fea
tures to be incorporated into a' State
road law.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Nino members of the police fores
made a record capture yesterday after
noon when they corraled nine blood
thirsty firemen and locKed them up
securely after a chase lasting an hour
and fifty minutes. The pursued men
fought fiercely and did not give in till
the last one was securely handcuffed.
Score â Policemen. 7; Firemen, 5.
It was the annual diamond struggle
of the two department* and the object
was sweet charity, so no one was sur
prised when 12,500 howling rooters for
the twtr rival teams swarmed into
Recreatipn Park and yelled lustily for
their favorites. And meanwhile the
rivals played ball as they never played
before. "
Every one who has anything to do
with directing the affairs of the mu
nicipality was at the park. The toot
ing of police whistles and the ringing
of tire bells could be heard for miles.
It was a real old gala day and the
coppers and the fire fighters shone as
they never shone before in all their
lives.
The game netted a handsome sum for
the benefit of the widows' and orphans'
funds of the two departments. The
exact sum was not given out last
night, but it is safe to say that between
$8000 and $10,000 was' realized by the
struggle for supremacy on the green
diamond.
The fire laddies went to the bat for
their first licks and the best they got
was nothing. But the coppers were
there with a run in their half of the
round and for many minutes after the
toot of hundreds of whistles made the
residents of nearby districts think that
an old time riot was on.
But the fire laddies' turn came in the
third inning. It was then that they
landed on the offerings of Mr. Charles
Birdsall and before the round had
passed into history three ladder sea
lers made the turn of the bases. Such
a yell as that which followed had not
been heard in the vicinity of Eighth
street in years. Battling chiefs for
got their dignity and threw their hats
into the air. As for Assistant Chief
Shaughnessy, he imagined he was a
two-year-old.
The firemen's joy lasted Just two In
nings, for in the fifth the finest got to
gether and after a short confab com
menced to lace the ball out. It was bing,
bins, bins' fcrr a few minutes. Every
man on the team seemed to be taking
a ride on the offerings of Mr. Fitz
patrick. Runs were as plentiful as
crooks on the Barbary Coast, no less
than four of the coppers sneaking
over the pan.
Again in the seventh the coppers
shone. Two more tallies were ham
mered in amid joyous shouts of detec
tives, patrolmen, captains and lieuten
ants. This cinched the game and the
firemen knew it. They could not do
any more till the last half of the
ninth, when 4 one more run was made
before the side retired.
Star â¢ plays were plentiful, Archie
Hamill making two catches out In
right iield that were worthy of a big
leaguer. Birdsall was a regular Cy
Young in the box when he settled down
to work, while Casey, Murphy and
Kelly played the game like vetefans.
Rube L.evy and Charley Gaggus dl
vlded the honors at umpiring.

The Mariposa also brought the intel
ligence that the French sloop-of-war
Zelee, which sailed some time since
from Tahiti for New Caledonia, had a
lot of trouble in her machinery room
during the trip. The pipes in the en
girle room burst and threw her ma
chinery out of order, at the same time
scalding three men.
To add to the general predicament
the captain was laid up with illness
during nearly the entire voyage. She
finally -reached New Caledonia and is
expected to return from that port to
Papeete.
The Mariposa brought the following
first-class passengers:
Count de. Calonne, Miss E. H. Bunk
ley. Miss M. Haack, Mrs. J. H. Follis,
Miss E. Tompkins, M. A. Meyer, H.
Meuel, D. Atwater, E. C. Travis, J. H.
Follis, Miss D. Van Ness, F. L. Travis.
A. L. White, Mrs. A. L. White, Miss
F. White, S. R. Church, E. Miller, T.
B. Eastland and C. Deflesselle.
Her cargo consisted in part of 33
cases and 160 crates Vanilla, 3168 sacks
copra, 29 cases alligator pears, 101 bar
rels and 191 cases shells, 6310 cocoanuts
in husk and 217 sacks cocoanuts husked.
She left Papeete June 14 at 11 a. m.
.Â«nd came into port here at 8:25 a. m.,
making: her running time 11 days and
in hours.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
steamship Mariposa arrived in port yes
terday. She was looking spick and span
as ever and clean as a whistle from
stem to stern. Captain James Rennie
reports that the weather . down and
back was delightful and that the pas
sengers seemed to enjoy the voyage im
mensely.
On the return trip she was a little
light in freight and bobbed about a
bit. There was scarcely any seasick
ness at all on board either going or
coming:.

The difficulty arose over Inomoto's
presence here In San Francisco in
stead of being behind one of Togo's
big guns making gaps imthe fortifica
tions of Port Arthur. Miyamori in
timated that the sailor could not fight,
anyway. Td prove the accusing land
lord in error Inomoto attacked him
with his knife, inflicting only slight
wounds, and then disappeared. .â¢
After Miyamori had explained to all
his neighbors how dishonorable and
unillustrious Sailor Inomoto was, he
washed his head and swore out a war
rant for the arrest of his assailant.
Not being able to overhaul a Itus-.
slan worthy of his steel, K. Inomoto, a
fierce young Japanese of the sailor
profession, last evening used his
pocketknife on K. Miyamori, his land
lord, at 15 Prospect place. Inomoto
had been indulging in heavy draughts
of American sake, which doubtless
drowned his sense of fraternalism. He
gave his countryman two scalp wounds
and fled.

play by â¢scoring with, a backward
stroke over his shoulder on a reversal
to ... avoid double interference. The
crowd was the largest of the season,
with several hundred San Franciscans
present. The teams were made up as

and of T. J. A. Tiedemann (80 not out).
The total of the married team was 248."
For the single men D. Jamieson played
a fine innings, scoring 92 runs not out.
H. E. Boulton assisted with 32, but the
total of the bachelors was only 159.
The full details follow:
The tennis players practiced both at
San Rafael and on the courts in this
City, yesterday for the coming State
championship tournament. The crack
players crossed the bay to accustom
themselves to the conditions at San
Rafael during the July tournament.
On the California Club courts Grant
Smith and Carl Gardner played two,
post sets. Gardner played a clever
game and won both sets. Smith was
in ooor form and seemed unable to
make a stroke. He will have to prac
tice hard to play his best game on the
Fourth of July.
Chester Smith and, Melville Long put
up a fine game against Harry Rolfe
and Harry Butler^ The match was
close, the first two sets going to Smith
and Long and the last to Butler and
Rolfe. Young Long was playing out
of his class but did ruily as well as
the other three.
Rolfe and Butler played an unfin
ished set in which the honors were
even, each winning fourteen games.
Walter S. MacGayin showed a flash
of his old time form in his match with
H.*E. Punnett. The veteran won two
sets from his opponent. ' â¢ -
On the park courts George Baker and
Clarence Foley furnished by far the
best match. Foley won the first . set
from the. park champion, but the lat
ter won the next three. The fourth
set was exceedingly close, and Baker
had no easy time disposing of his
younger opponent.
Another good match was that be
tween Clarence Griffln and James A.
Code. Griffln won botn seis, but Code
was right on edge and came near win
ning. In the second set he had a lead
of 5-2, but as usual fell down. Code
has improved considerably of late and
his club mates are finding him a hard
man to beat. He hits the ball much
harder than formerly.
On the Hotel Rafael courts Frank
Mitchell proved the best player. He
beat Herbert Long and S. C. Gaynesa.
Long secured three games in his set
with Mitchell, but Gayness failed to
get a game.
In doubles George Janes and H. Long
played a tie with A. H. Brabant and
Gaynees, each winning tljree sets.
Long was the star of the four, his
driving being the feature of the match.
The score follows:^
California Club â W. S. MacGarvln beat H.
E. Punnett 6-4. 6-5: Chester Smith and Mel
ville Long beat Harry Rolfe and Harry Butler
0-4,6-4,7-8; E. P. Robbins beat Harry Spring

Glorious weather, abundant good
cheer and a big bunch of talent com
bined to make the Corinthian Yacht
Club's "High Tide" at Paradise Cove
yesterday In honor of the Family Club
a brilliant . success..
Many of the yachts of the Corinthian
fleet cruised up to Paradise Cove on
Saturday night and others joined them
yesterday morning. McNeill's launch
Flyer conveyed several guests to the
rendezvous, and others went oh "-board
the "steamer Golden Gate. The cove
was filled with yachts lying at anchor,
the flagship Speedwell and others being
decorated gayly with prize and signal
flags. Among the yachts were the yawls
Seven Bells, Acapulco and Frolic, the
schooner Lady Ada, the sloops Josie,
Belle, Truant, Emilie, Corinthian, Edna,
Genesta, Meteor, Neptune, Aloha, Dis
covery, Ruby, Espy, Freda, Thelma,
Presto, Vixen, Elsie, Beaver, Phoenicia
and Harpoon; the yawls Nereid and El
Rayo of the Corinthian fleet. The
schooner White "Wings, the yawl Royal
and the sloop Ariel represented the San
Francisco Yacht Club.
On arriving at Paradise Cove, many
small boats were on hand to take the
visitors ashore, where a baseball match
was soon begun between teams repre
senting the Family and Corinthian
Clubs. The Corinthian nine in four
innings scored 13 to 7. "Keegan"
Schober covered himself with glory by
scoring a home run.
After the baseball all hands ad
journed to a bull's-head breakfast un
derneath the trees. This was followed
by songs rendered by Signor Abramoff,
the Edna Quartet, Harry Cashman,
J. Noyes and others. "Kid" Nelson
rendered some songs excellently and
gave a fine imitation of a "barker" of
a menagerie.
The Superior Court "of the city and
county was well represented in the
persons of Judges John Hunt, F. H.
Kerrigan and W. P. Lawlor. f The Cor
inthian baseball nine was made up of
Schober, Follansbee, Johns, Sager,
Brickell, Marshall, Fay, Hammersmith
and Raymond.
The Family representatives were
Sweeney, Esberg, Lilienthal, Dott.
Moroney, CosgrlfT, Ford, Phlandt, Ros
borough, Dunn and McWilliams. Frank
W. Thompson was announcer and um
pire.
About 3:30 p. m. the yachtsmen be
gan to return to moorings, which were
reached in good season.

It took fifteen cars to convey to Sun
set Park yesterday the 900 p,eople who
attended the family outing of the San
Francisco Relief Committee, Foresters
of America. The feature of , the out
ing was the dancing, which, after the
luncheon in shady nooks by the bab
bling streams, was kept up for several
hours. It was a well conducted affair,
which gave many who did not care to
dance an opportunity to enjoV the In
vigorating air and the beauty of- wild
mountain scenery.
Foresters' Outing Is Enjoyed
The handsome Church of St. James,
at the corner of Twentv-third and
Guerrero streets, was the scene of a
beautiful service yesterday in 'com
memoration of the twenty-fifth anni
versary of the ordination of Rev. P.
R. Lyrtth. Father Lynch founded and
organized the church in 1888 and has
been its rector ever since. Previous
to that time Father Lynch had spent
ome tiitie in the mountain countries
ministering to communities widely
scattered and turbulent. They were
seeking gold, not God.
The interior of the church was dec
orated. The altar. of pure white, cov
ered with flowers and with every wax
taper lighted, formed an imposing
sight. High mass was -held' and this
gave opportunity j for the beautiful
choral and instrumental music. Father
Flynn was the celebrant and his so
norous voice echoed to the vaulted roof.
Several priests from other churches
of the city were in the sanctuary and
many were in the congregation that
filled every pew In the - great church.
Rev. Peter C. Yorke delivered a ser
mon and a eulogy of Father Lynch,
dwelling at length on the work- and
self-sacrifice of the' rector of St. James.
Father Lynch was also the recipient
of mementos from "his many friends.
After the service Father Lynch met
the men of the parish and gave an
informal luncheon at the parochial
residence. The following priests Trom
churches in the city and nearby towns
were present:
Reverends P. S. Casey, Father Frie
den. Father Vlubert, M. D. Connolly,
P. J. Cummins, M. . D. Slattery,. R.
Fuhr, M. Neumann,. John F. Nugent,

Callaghan, P. E. . Mulligan, John Cul
len, William Lyons, Father Calzie, Rev.
Father Byrne of Napo, Rev. P.' Farley
of Pasadena and Rev. Father Doran of
St. Patrick's Seminary.
Solemn vespers and benediction were
held last night at 7:30 o'clock.
Father Lynch came to the Pacific
Coast with the highest. hope of accom
plishing great results. He .was ordained
by the Right Rev. Stephen .Vincent
Ryan of Buffalo, on June' 24, 1879, at
Bonaventure Seminary, CattarauguB
County, New York. ; Immediately after
his ordination he came to San Fran
cisco and was appointed assistant pas
tor of St. Patrick's Church, Mission
Father Lynch then became assistant
to the Rev. Father James Croke at St.
Vincent's Church, San Rafael. .'; He was
later recalled to St. Patrick's Church,
where he labored until appointed by
Archbishop Riordan, in. May, .1SS5, to
the pastorate of St. Patrick's, Sonora,
where he remained till November, 1886.

ORPHEUM'S. NEW BILL.
CONTAINS MANY HITS
The natives of the island are deemed
the best pearl divers in the world and
for years they have made a living at
their craft. But when the Americans
appeared on the scene with their pat
ent machine they nearly monopolized
the Industry of the natives, who de
pend almost entirely on pearl diving as
a means of livelihood.
The divers are cruising about the
South Seas in a little schooner in com
mand of an old seaman named Max
well, well known In that part of the
globe. Maxwell became wroth when
the natives of the Island drove him
away and he at once entered a protest*
with the Tahiti Government. As a re
sult the gunboat Zelee was sent to the
scene of the trouble and may be heard
from soon. :*&,
The Americans were routed quickly.
The natives have since kept a sharp
watch and there seems little chance of
the enterprizing divers encroaching on
the beds. It is said that the Americans
were deriving a profitable income from
their thrift, but it is probably at an
end now. ':Â¦': â¢'. ".-.
The officers on board the Alameda,
which arrived- in this city yesterday,
bring the startling intelligence that the
natives of the island of Taumotu, one
of the smallest of the South Seas
group, have seized the diving appar
atus brought to their country by a par
ty of enterprising Americans who
aimed to monopolize the oyster pearl
diving industry of that neighborhood.
The Americans arrived at the little
island some time ago with an elaborate
diving apparatus and quietly ' set to
work to rid the seas of a lot of the
pearl oysters so abundant thereabouts.
The natives did not comprehend at
first what it all meant, but soon they
began to observe that pearl oysters
were getting scarce and they at once
pounced on the foreigners and their
â¢'devil machine."

Howe and Scott, as Hebrew comedians,
complete the entertaining programme.
The pictures of the fire department
are not realistic, inasmuch as they fail
to show action. The machines that
cast the pictures on the canvas seem
to be defective and a mistake would
be made If Chief Sullivan should per
mit the films to be exhibited as cor
rect portrayals of the maneuvers of
the local department.
That there was a great deal of en
mity on both sides Is admitted. The
police say the non-union employes of
the stables had often threatened to
"get" the union men should they try
to. intimidate them. The strikers, on
the other hand, were alleged to have
made threats against the "scabs."
Little is known of Smith. Williams
and Williamson, the three negroes un
der arrest. Smith says he has been in
this city for four years and has fol
lowed various occupations. The other
two are comparative strangers and the
the police know nothing of their past.
They stand by the statements made
last night, and say they were attacked
before the fatal shot was fired.
The Inquest over the body of the
dead man will probably be held to
morrow. Detective Ryan wants to
have It postponed as long as possible
in order that he may collect some evi
dence.
MUCH BITTER FEELING.
â¢ The union men who were with Gal
lagher at the time he was shot are
keeping under cover. Gallagher's
young wife is prostrated, and she and
her child present a pitiful sight. He
'was their sole support and his death
has left them in poverty.
The proprietors of the Excelsior,sta
bles apparently know nothing about the
shooting. : They can give no Informa
tion other than that' they have heard
that the union men had been threaten
ing to make the non-union' hands quit
their places of employment. They say
that Gallagher was a peaceable citizen
and a good workman. No one around
the stables saw him loitering in the
vicinity on the night of the shooting.
Eye witnesses of .the snooting tell
different stories. In fact, no two relate
the same tale. Some say that but two
shots were fired, but others swear that
five or more explosions were distinctly
heard. The police say there must have
been a dozen shots exchanged.
EYE WITNESSES DIFFER.
Another -Important discovery vtsls
made by Ryan. He found two bullet
marks In the house at the southwest
corner of Polk and Post streets. This
house is situated directly back of where
the negro fired the fatal shot, so there
is .no question -that the bullet holes
were made by one of the party of
union men.
The detectives working to solve the
motive , for the murder of Andrew
Owen Gallagher, the striking stable
man who was killed by James Smith,
a non-union negro employed; at tha
Excelsior, stables on Polk street, have
uncovered more evidence that tends to
show that Gallagher was one of the
attacking party.
Detective Thomas Ryan visited the
scene of the shooting yesterday morn
ing. He discovered a revolver in the
gutter of Walnut avenue. Two of Its
chambers had been discharged. The
negroes under arrest positively deny
owning the revolver, and the police be
lieve it is the property of one of the
party of union men involved in the
row.
