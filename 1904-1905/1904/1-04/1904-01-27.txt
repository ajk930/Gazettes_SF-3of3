WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â Senator

eye at this time has caused the great
est concern over his illness, and to-day
there w;ere â¢ conflicting stories of his
condition.
It is positively* stated by Rear Ad

navy, Senator Hanna's physician, that
his patient is not Â¦ seriously ill. The
Senator , dressed himself this evening
and sat. up to dinner in his apartments
at the Arlington Hotel.
Senator Hanna Is a bad Invalid, and
as a result of this he will probably have
a setbjick to-morrow. Each time he has
left: his bed he has been the worse
for it.
'Dr. Rixey said to-night: "Senator
Hanna is better than he was yesterday.
If he continues to improve as he has to
day he will be out in a short time. He
did hot entirely recover from the at
tack; of the, grip he had . in New York

the man who formerly had controlled
the world's markets and who had

It 'was learned here to-day that - the
insurgents are destroying American
property ' in Santo . Domingo. The
United States cruiser Columbia left
here' this morning for San Pedro Ma
corls ' : "to protect American interests
there, ah American Consul at San Pe
dro having telegraphed to Minister
Powell advising him of the necessity
of ;the. cruiser's presence and saying,
also, that other foreign interests were
imperiled. The Government is un
able . to afford the necessary protec
tion. Certain .American sugar estates
at San Pedro, are considered to be es
pecially threatened,' as they are some,

' That there .will be anything but con
stant revolution in Santo Domingo un
less the United States 1 steps in and es
tablishes ' a ; protectorate nobody here
believes. The administration, however,
is not unanimous in 1 its opinion on this
subject. Secretary Hay is against ex
tending a protectorate to Santo Do
mingo. The President* realizes thelm
perative necessity for,some kind of ac
tion, but is not inclined to take up the
question for.* final ( decision until the
Panama treaty is ratified.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 26â Strong
influences are working it Is said, with
a fair show of success, to induce Presi
dent Roosevelt to establish a protecto
rate over the republic of Santo Domin
go. No move of any kind will be made
by the Government, however, until
after the. ratification of the Panama
treaty.
The chronic estate of revolution in
Santo Domingo interferes with the busi
ness . of American citizens who have
commercial interests there^ It stag
nates trade and endangers the lives of
neutrals .and non-combatants. The
country is alternately taxed and devas
tated' by federal Â«and revolutlonary
governments. Three American war
ships, .two German cruisers and one
French cruiser are now engaged in pro
tecting foreign commercial interests in
Santo Domingo. This Government al
ready knows positively, that any ac
tion oh its part, however drastic, to^the

"When the next Democratic conven
tion undertakes to write a platform it
will find the last one a model of clear
ness arid conciseness and . of square
dealing: and I hope that the delegates
to the convention will b^e instructed by
the various States to indorse It.
"And how about candidates? It does
not matter much what the name of the
Presidential candidate is, but it does
matter what he stands for, and in what
direction he is going to lead the party.
Let the Republican . party be chal
lenged to meet the moral issue present
edâthis is- democratic, this is patriotic.
Let this be done, arid unless reason and
love of country have fled we shall fight
without being ashamed. If v.-e lose it
will be but a temporary, defeat and will
bring no" disgrace with it. If we win
the victory \ will mean much for our
country and for the world."
"One evidence that our party was
honestly seeking to secure justice to
the masses in 1896 and 1900 is to be
found in the fact that our campaign
funds were insignificant in both cam
paigns. In 1892 the party
collected a larse campaign fund from
the corporations. It spent more than
51,000,000 in the .two States of New
York and Indiana aloneâ and what was
the result? The most plutocratic ad
ministration this country has ever
known. We witnessed a surrender' to
organized and predatory wealth, so ab
ject and so complete that seven years
of exile from power have not entirely
removed the stain from the party. You
ask why I am opposed to the reorgan
ization of the Dembcratic party. Be
cause I want my party to define the
rights of the people: I want it to be
the fearless champion of their inter
ests; I want it to present the moral
issue involved in public questions and
to appeal to the public conscience.

CLEVELAND'S CAMPAIGN FUND.
NEW YORK, Jan. 26.â Every seat in
the Madison Square Concert Hall was
taken to-night when "William J. Bryan
began his speech on "Moral Issues."
In the audience there were many wom
en, . while the body of the hall was
more than half filled with clergymen.
There was no presiding officer, Bryan
being escorted to the platform, where
he was greeted with prolonged ap
plause. He said in part:
"I have preferred to speak independ
ently of any organization, because I
do not care to embarrass any friends
or supporters who may differ from me
in opinion. Both I and they, therefore,
are left to pursue in the future, as we
have in the past, the course that seems
to us best.
NEW YORK. Jan. 26.â If North
River was not drunk this afternoon it
ought to have been, for 12,000 kegs of
beer were dumped into It.
The beer came from the Conrad
Stein's Sons' brewery. Some time ago
the Lion brewery got control of the
Stein business, but the bill of sale did
not include the building, the machinery
or the Supply of beer on hand. What
the Lion brewery did get was the
other company's good will and out
standing accounts. The Steins have de
cided to retire from business and the
building and machinery are now on the
market.
When the Lion brewery got control
there were some 2072 barrels of lager in
the Stein brewery, and to keep it there
the Stein concern would have had to
renew a bond for $75,000 with the inter
nal revenue authorities. This bond ex
pires about the end of this month.
The Stein brewery tried to sell the
beer at any price, but could not get a
purchaser. Representatives of the
Lion . brewery said that -they did not
.want the beer,.b+cause.it; -was not* tip
to their standard. Moreover, If the
beer were sold $S00O would hate to be
paid out in revenue stamps. So It was
decided to let all this good beer so to
waste. â¢
Alf the barrels were carried into the
cellar and the bungs were knocked out.
There are pipe connections between the
floor and the sewer and the beer flowed
merrily through these into the river.
"It was a beautiful pale sea," said
one of the inspectors, who gloomily
â¢watched the beer go to waste. "It took
nearly all day to run the beer Into the
river. When the news spread along
Tenth avenue and the river front the
gloom was so thick that it could havÂ«
been cut."
Special Dispatch to Tbo Call.
" "It. is true. No concessions can be
made. "You know well eirough our
desire to get to southern waters. "We
are .balked ; by greed arid' jealousy.
The Baltic is closed six months in the
year.. We had to forge eastward and
at. last got ,there. You Americans and
Englishmen are">using the Japanese as
weapons and are trying to shut us in.
What â¢ second-rate power would toler

sia. . It is impossible. We have not
hitherto been a commercial nation, but
the commercial, .spirit is growing
apace, and, having; got our outlet, it is

A naval service paper to-day prints
a detailed statement of the strength
of the respective fleets in Asiatic wa
ters, and places .Russia, .and' Japan
on aboutan even\footing, Russia pre
ponderating. ;with heavy vessels - and
Japan with torpedo-boats.
An indication , that, public feeling
is aroused. in' the interior is^shown by
a dispatch from Krostroma, 230 miles
from Moscow, 'saving, that when- or
ders were; received, by the, local bat
talions, calling for twenty-four addi

great efforts during a ; half century*,
which she has been able to crown
with success 'only by a "terrible ex
penditureof life and money." - â¢ r '
I asked him 'whether it was true
that his Ma jesty had' declared that ho
concessions^ could -be made to Japan.
He replied:
ST. â¢PETERSBURG, Jan. 26.â Much
as I should like to "echo the words of

A business; man to whom I showed
the report sent to an English paper, to

ger of war- Had passed, was amazed.
He said:. ;.
"Quite the contrary is. the case. The
spirit of business men whom I am
seeing j every- day- Â¦ was very much
shaken. The proof of this is that the

the utmost difficulties about doing

that ali officers on leave in the Far

ernment has diplomatically inti
mated to Baron de Rosen, the: Russian
Minister, that an early response Is de
sired to her recent note. It is calculated
here that Japan's note reached the
Russian Cabinet on â¢ the j afternoon of
January 16, and it is felt that sufficient
time has elapsed for its consideration
and the preparation of a response. The
Japanese 'Government' is conscious of
the possible necessities of the military
and naval situation and is unwilling to
permit evasions and delays which are
designed to gain time.* â¢ Â¦.â¢/â¢ ,; *;'
The future course, of the Japanese
Government is a carefully guarded se-'
cret. The length of time that Japan is
prepared to await 'the' pleasure of. Rus
sia is unknown. It seems probable that
it has been determined to act * de
cisively within a few days. â¢' :Â¦ .- .
The popular temper has long opposed
further delay. While many objected to
Japan taking the initiative, a majority
would now welcome the issuance of a

SAN JOSE, Jan. 26.â Whitaker
Wright spent the summers of 1892,
1893 and 1894 in San Jose. He made
his home at the Hotel Vendome and
was accompanied by his wife and two
children. In 1892 he spent several
months here. He was trying to float
some gigantic mining scheme he had
In South America. He approached a
number -of moneyed men in this city
with the project, but they were afraid
of the investment.
Wright represented himself as a
man" of great wealth. He had many
men come to see. him while he was
here, but apparently was unable to d6
any business. All the time he main
tained ..his office in San Francisco and
made almost daily trips to that
city. He spoke about investing his
wealth in Santa Clara County and San
Jose property. In 1893 he took a fancy
to a fine residence on Stockton avenue
and was planning to buy it." In order
to see if it suited him he rented it
with the option of buying it. . After
two months he gave it up and moved
back to the Hotel Vendome.
' The next year Wright Bpent less
time here and lived entirely at the
Vendome. He met many of the local
financiers, but was unable to impress
them with the merits of his money
making schemes. Mrs.-Wrlght moved
in*. the highest social circles of San
Jose and the couple were well re
ceived. Wright would spend the week
days in his San Francisco office and
on Sundays would have "several pros
pective investors from the city as his
guests at the hotel. When Wright and
his family left here they lived for
some time in San Francisco and then
went to New York.

says that even in that remote .spot
Russia's active preparation for war
was evident. Troops were moving from
all directions toward the scene of
probable conflict and Reid declares
that Russia is ready and able to give
the Japanese all the flght they want.
Reid speaks highly of Russia's atti
tude toward American enterprises on
Russian soil. He says the Czar's Gov

commends Russia as a fruitful field for
the enterprising white man who has
money enough to develop the opportu

Although this slightly unfavorable turn

willing to concede this, believing the
effect will be to make the sea of Japan

which affects the interests of maritime
powers as well as Russia. The latter
has rail outlets from the coast of the

without such means of communication,

in seeing that the entrance to the sea

The subject of the powdfcr â or, as it
has been called, the spirit of artillery â
cannot be overlooked in the examina
tion of guns. In the last few years the
use of so-called smokeless powders has
become universal. These are all nltro
substitution products, and their princi
pal characteristic from an artillery
point' of view is the fact that the entire
weight, or very nearly the entire
weight, turns into gas. In the older
powders only about 60 per cent of the
weight was gasified, and the remaining
40 per cent was projected from .the gun .
in the form of dust and constituted a
considerable waste of ..energy. The point
not entirely' satisfactory in modern
powders Is their constancy in pressure
and velocity and stability in storage.
It is a question whether under the same
conditions of storage they are as stable
and safe as the old-fashioned "powder.
Indeed, there is every reason to be
lieve that they are not as safe or as
stable, and they are watched with great
care at stated times when stored. Inci
dentally, this powder gives little or no
smoke, which is usually but not always
an advantage.

With increased and increasing de
mand for coal came the necessity for
opening out lower seams, and deeper
shafts meant a heavier capital expendi
ture in colliery enterprise. It is worthy
of remark how little the outside public
realize of. the great difficulties that
often have to be overcome in sinking
such as passing through water-bearing
strata or running sands â or of the enor
mous cost entailed by some colliery de
velopments, writes Professor R. A. S.
Redmayne in the Engineering Maga
zine.
As early as 1829 John Buddie In giv
ing evidence before the House of Lords
declared that the cost of sinking, even
then, was frequently Â£10,000 to Â£15,000,
and J. T. Taylor stated before a select
committee on rating of mines in 1857
that at Haswell colliery, in the county
of Durham, Â£40.000 was expended fn
contending with a quicksand, and that
the shaft had' ultimately to be aban
doned. At Murton colliery, a few miles
distant from Haswell, Â£300,000 was ex
pended in sinking; the quantity of
water pumped during the operation of
passing through the overlying magne
slan limestone bed amounted to an av
erage of 9305 gallons per minute from
a depth of 540 feet, ana thethree shafts
ultimately reached the Hulton seam at
a depth of 1488 feet from the surface In
April, 1843. Many deep and costly sink
ings â several much deeper than in the
last instanceâ have been put down since
the Murton "Winning, tmt none I believe
at a greater expenditure of capital,
owing doubtless to the greatly im
proved methods now employed in car
rying on such operations through
watery strata, notably the Kind-Chau
dron system, whereby the shaft Is
bored out and the side protected by
metal cylinders lowered from the sur
face; and the Poetsch or Goberat meth
ods, whereby the water is frozen in the
"running" sand or other water-bearing
stratum, and the shaft sunk through

"Whitaker Wright." said Justice Big
ham, "in my opinion the jury could
not, on the evidence, arrive at any
other conclusion than which they
have expressed in their verdict. I con
fess I see nothing that in any way
excuses the crime of which you have
now been* found guiltyi and I cannot
conceive of a worse case than yours.
Under the sections of the act of Par
liament under which you have been
indicted, and which define the. offenses
in these circumstances, I do not think
that I have any option save to visit
you with the most severe penalty which
the act permits, and that is that. you
As Justice Bigham, in sharp and re
morseless tones, answered Walton,
Wright was peremptorily ordered to
stand up.
When the jury filed in at 3 o'clock
Wright showed his first signs of nerv
ousness. Peering through his glasses,
he leaned forward to catch tbe fore
man's answer. At the word Vguilty,"
which broke the tense, expectant si
lence, Wright did not even flinch, but,
sticking his hands^deep down into his
pockets and gazing rather grimly at
his Judge, he stood up to receive sen
tence. To the cry, of a woman, that
came from the back of the court, and
to the 1 realization that his career as
a man of business and honor was ended,
Wright seemed utterly oblivious. He
sat down mechanically, while Walton
made a plea for mercy.
Justice Bigham began summing up
to-day and the courtroom was crowd
ed. During several previous sessions
Wright had gone, to sleep. He had ad
hered to, his conviction that he could
not possibly be found. guilty and it was
upon this conviction that he, against
the advice of his lawyers/ insisted upon
returning from the United . States to
stand trial. As Justice Bigham empha
sized the points against Wright, expa
tiated to the jury, upon the immorality
of issuing misleading balance , sheets
and the doubtfulness of the transac
tions of the London and Globe Finan
cial Corporation under Wright's guid
ance, the prisoner showed intense in
terest; yet when the jury retired
Wright still retained confidence in his
acquittal. He reiterated that he had
done nothing which was not done
every day in the city.
For an hour Wright awaited the ver
dict, meanwhile talking cheerfully With
his counsel, while the city magnates,
members of the aristocracy and the
other spectators who crov/ded the room
kept their eyes riveted upon â¢â the man
whose fate hung in the balance.
COOLLY II EARS SENTENCE.
death has caused much sorrow. ; He
was well known here for his acts of
generosity and it was generally be
lieved that he would be acquitted and
return home again." '
JUSTICE BIGHAM CRITICIZED.
The feeling that Justice Blgham's
conduct of the case was not very judi
cial appears to grow in legal circles of
London, and the sentence imposed upon
Wright In itself would have supplied
England with an unexpected sensation.
Until counsel commenced pleading the
actual trial of Whitaker Wright scarce
ly aroused that keerTvpublic interest
which was exhibited when Wright was
in the United States or -when Parlia
ment decided^he did .not' come within
the pale of lawbreakers. When Messrs.
Isaacks and Walton started to make
their appeal to the Jury the people
awoke to the gravity of the issues con
cerned. Even the Government was in
volved,'for it had taken the-" stand
that Wright could not be prosecuted.
Furthermore, it was an open, secret
that many great and even royal names
were indirectly involved in the pro
ceedings. Friends of Wright had said
that, if driven into a* corner, he would
tell who had profited by" his transac
tions. Suspense reigned, in many
quarters while counsel for the defense
made their appeal, but when the ap
peal was finished those / involved
breathed easier and public curiosity re
mained unsatisfied.
WRIGHT AWAITS VERDICT.
- Dealing with the evidence Justice
Bigham described as singular the way
in which thousands of pounds sterling
became millions on paper, so far as
the Lakeview shares were concerned.
The London and Globe and Standard
were gambling, concerns, which excited
his indignation. In the course of hia
long experience, Justice Bigham said,
he had never before heard of- anything
like- the transactions which preceded
the hopeless bankruptcy of the London
and Globe Financial Corporation.
Justice Bigham concluded his refer
ence" to Wright's career by referring to
the position which the defendant
claimed to have occupied InNew York
and Philadelphia, and said Wright had
built up a fine position for himself in
two or three years, and if it was neces
sary, to. secure a motive for his actions
It would be found in his desire to main
tain this position. At the same time it
was said that after -the crash of the
London and Globe Financial Corpora
tion he found, himself with $1,500,000 to
$2,000,000 in worthless securities.
In charging the jury Justice Big
ham gave evidence of the utmost bias.
He said he would ask the Jurors to find
a general verdict of guilty or not guilty.
If they were satisfied that Wright was
guilty of one or more of the charges
they must not be deterred from find
ing a verdict of guilty by the sujcsres
tion that such a verdict would .cast a
slur upon the memory of Lords Duf
ferin and Loch. It would not -do any
thing of the kind. Their conduct was
consistent in their having honestly
made mistakes.
BIASED CHARGE TO JURY.
Suddenly Wright, fell backward, as
if he had fainted The officer who was
waiting to take him t9 Brixton Prison
ran to King> College Hospital, which
is near by, for - a doctor. In the mean
while the unconscious man was propped
up on two chairs. The doctor came
quickly.' His -first thought was that
Wright had fallen in an ordinary apo
pleDtlc fit, but it was. noticed that his
heart began gradually to give out,
and before another doctor could ar
rive Whitaker Wright, within one hour
of the time of his sentence, was dead.
An examination of the Dody. made at
a late hour to-night, points strongly to
the fact that death was due to poison.
The post-mortem examination will be
held on Wednesday. Throughout the
evening a crawd of curious persons
lingered around the law courts and in
order to avoid scenes the body of
Wright had to be. taken out by a side
entrance and conveyed almost by
stealth to the mortuary.
FALLS AS IX A FAINT.
"Oh, never mind," said Wright; "I
don't mind it a. bit," and .with, a firm
step and looking in perfect health the
convicted man strode to the consulta
tion room to take farewell of his so
licitors.
For some twenty minutes Wright dis
cussed his family affairs and the dis
position, of his remaining money. He
frankly expressed his amazement at
the verdict, and still more^so at the
sentence, but George LeWis' s Jr., his so
licitor, tells the press, that he spoke
rather as a man prepared to "grin and
bear.it" than as a man who contem
plated suicide.
'It was apparent that he would have
said more, but two tipstaffs took him
by the arms and led him out of court.
i A friend pressed forward to offer his
condolences.
The crowd in court gasped in sur
prise. Wright was almost the only per
son present who appearejJ to be un
moved. Then, turning to the ' reporters
in the,, room, rather than, to his Judge,
he cried out in a firm voice:
"All I can say is that I am as inno
cent of any intention to deceive as any
one in this room." .

rant for his arrest had been issued in
London five days previously, but Wright
had already left for the United States.
He was accused of having absconded
with funds of the London and Globe
Finance Corporation, by which the
stockholders lost more than $111,000,000.
j The ostensible purpose of the London
and Globe company was to facilitate
investments by the shareholders in va
rious enterprises, ranging from mines
developed and undeveloped to street
railways and water works.
Whitaker Wright was a broker in
Philadelphia and New York. Wright
was one of the biggest plungers on the
exchange. He also invested heavily In
West Australian mines. After making
more than J15.000.000 out of them he
"went broke." Then he went to Lon
don, where he floated the London and
Globe.
The financial crash of the companies
floated by Wright came in December,
1900. There were eleven of these, includ
ing the parent company, entitled the
London and Globe Finance Corpora
tion, with a total capitalization of $60.
675,000. Wright was managing director.
One of the victims of the crash was
the late Marquis of Dufferin and Ava,
formerly Governor General of Canada
and later British Ambassador in Paris.
He consented to be chairman' of the
London and Globe and had 25,000 shares
in the different companies. With Lord
Dufferin on the board of directors were
Lieutenant General Gough-Calthrop,
who. was colonel of the Fifth Dragoon
Guards, and Lord Edward William Pel
ham-Clinton, master of Queen Victo
ria's household, son of. the fifth Duke
of Newcastle. When the crash came
Lord Dufferin was severely censured
for his connection with the Wright
companies, but in a frank speech to the
stockholders of the London and Globe
he declared his position and won the
sympathy of his countrymen.
Much American money was lost in
the failure of the Wright companies.
There was a great outcry against the
attitude of the authorities in not pros
ecuting^ Wright and his fellow directors,
and a petition was circulated on the
London Stock Exchange, signed by
many influential men, demanding the
prosecution of Wright.
Few millionaires lived in as princely
style as did Whitaker Wright.

Almost every one, from personal experience, knows that the effects of any kind of sevens physical
strain are feit, first of all, in the small of the back -in other words in those Vital Organs, the Kidneys.

true whenever the kidneys are weak or out of order:
The Great Kidney Remedy, Swamp Root, strsngthens the kidneys and through them helps all the
other organs.
WOMEN suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease is not always correctly understood; in
many cases when doctoring they are led to believe that womb trouble or female weakness of some sort is
responsible for their ills, when in fact disordered kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles.

Indian Philosophy.
The sermon of a British vicar charg
ing great immorality in the pottery
towns in Staffordshire has caused dls
cussion of life in the potteries. A curi
ous feature is speculation on the liv^s
of others. The business of the insur
ance'companies there is largely direct
ed to persuading people to insure the
lives of others as a speculation. Wives
are urged- to insure their husbands,
and sons and daughters to take, out a
policy on .their parents' lives. For a
penny a week a girl insures her father
for Â£5. Xo medical examination is re
quired, and it is simply a gamble on
death. This was amusingly shown by
a recent case. A doctor in one of the
pottery towns was reported to be dying
of cancer. The rumor was false, and
the doctor, completely recovered of nts
illness, was surprised to learn that hi.s
charwoman had staked two pence a
week on his death.â New York Tribune.

Californians In New York.
At this point the Armour manager,
in the opinion of some of the traders,
determined to repeat the effort to dis
pose of part of the long Armour line,
in which move he was Da Iked by the
bears yesterday. Valentine left the pit
and brokers began at once to execute
selling orders. In an instant pande
monium broke loose. Every operator in
the pit to be trying to sell,
with the result that the price dropped
*Â£c at a trade until the low mark of
ST^ic was reached. Apparently to stem
th<Â» tide the Armour interests were
forced to change the orders to sell into
orders to buy and the bears were again
balked after having won a second tem
porary victory in two days over the
most feared of the big bulls.
The market opened quietly with no
indication of the sensational drop in
prices soon to occur. Traders were un
certain as to the significance of yes
terday's big trade and Valentine added
to their confusion by openly buying
May wheat to the extent of 750,000
bushels, selling at the same time about
100,000 bushels of wheat for July deliv
ery. Under the influence of his buy
ine the price rose Me and to all ap
pearances the bull interests held com
plete sway.
CHICAGO, Jan. 26.â The wheat pit
of the Board of Trade was the scene
of successive bear triumphs and dis
comfiture to-day. Within a period of
ten minutes the price of wheat for May
delivery fell 2>^c a bushel, a loss which
was more than recovered, the closing
quotation for the day showing a net
gain of 'ic as compared with last
niehfs final figures. For a time A. J.
Valentine, president of the Armour
Grain Company and manager of J. Os
don Armour's interests on the Board of
Trade, was in the pit personally buying
all the May wheat offered, and at this
time the owner of wheat for that
month's delivery seemingly could have
disposed of any quantity of it at 89?4e.
After Valentine had left the pit the
bears, confident in his absence, made
a successful raid into the Armour do
main and May wheat was worth S7*4c.
Such, at least, is one interpretation put
upon the enigmatic operations con
ducted in the pit through the repre
sentatives of various commission
houses. Other gossip is to the effect
that the wholesale selling was really
tor the Armour account.
The streets are filled to-night with
people who have come out to witness
the illuminations and the crowd is
probably more enthusiastic and greater
than upon any other occasion of the

Up to a late hour no one had appeared
at the Morgue to claim the body and
i*. is not known whether any relatives
reside in this city. A letter from Man-
Itou, Colo., addressed to Otto Wiede
meier, Alturas, in the same State, in
reference to some stock certificates,
may shed some light upon his identity.
Wiedemeier bought the tailor shop at
153 Ninth street about three weeks ago.
A sign on the door reads. "Will be
back in ten minutes."
While walking in the sand, dunes
north of the Sutro Baths last evening
about 5 o'clock William Roach of 313
Cough street came across the dead
body of a man supposed to be that of
Otto R. C. Wiedemelei^ A caDinz
wound above the right temple, from
which the blood was still oozing, and
a SS-callber revolver lying alongside thn
body indicated the cause of death. Th*
Coroner was notified and the body was
removed to the Morgue.
The dead man was welt dressed and
bore every evidence . of refinement.
About $80 in gold and greenbacks wai
found in the pockets of the clothing,
also C0.0OO shares of miscellaneous min
ing stock in various Colorado com
panies. The identification was estab
lished by the mining stock and several
letters. A bill of sale for a tailor. shop
at 153 Ninth street from John Lune
burg and a card bearing the inscrip
tion J. B. Arnold. 792 Capp street, were
also found on the body.
CorDoral Lewis of the Sixty-fourth
Company of Coast Artillery, stationed
at Fort Miley. said he saw the deceased
about three-quarters of an hour before
the finding of the body and thought his
actions were peculiar.

aye. He declared the resolution lost,
and when there was a call for a divi

closed the debate. Several delegates
objected, saying that they desired to
go on record as favoring the raise, and
they were told they could submit their
objections in writing.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET.
N. \\\, WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.âCali
fornia's delegatkm in Congress has
agreed on the matter of a camp and
maneuver grounds. The agreement
reached will be represented either by
a new bill to be introduced by Con
gressman Daniels or by amendments to
the pending bill to the effect that an
appropriation is to be made in the sum
of $500,000 for the purchase of grounds
in San Luis Obispo and Monterey coun
ties, California, if the area is not less
than 24,000 acres, for a permanent camp
ground for the regular army and Na
tional Guard of the Western States.
No particular ground is named and the
matter of a choice between the two
ranches, for it is admitted Santa Mar
parita is out of it, will be left to the
War Department. This removes all
contention and it is thought practically
secures to California the camp ground,
which is the only aim of the delegation.
The deficiency bill will be amended
po as to provide the sum found to be
necessary for the erection of a Federal
building at Los Angeles. An appropria
tion had been made of 5175,000, but the
condemnation proceedings to secure the
site resulted in the discovery that this
sum was just $19,760 short of being
r-nouch. Backed by the recommenda
tion of Secretary Shaw, calling upon
Congress to take immediate action, the
appropriation will be increased to

?j<ecial Dispatch to Tlie Call
Once again the crack of the pistol
has sounde'd in Chinatown, and a mur
derous highbinder has nearly earned
his blood money. Ng See" Poy, a well
known Chinese physician, lies at the
point of death at the Central Emer
gency Hospital from two bullet wounds
received last night about 8:30 o'clock
while on his way to answer what sub
sequently proved to have been a fic
titious call. The shooting occurred in
the rear of 1007A Stockton street, and
the colice have taken into custody a
Chinese giving the name of Ah Sam
on suspicion of having been implicated
in the attempted murder.
Shortly after S o'clock Ng See Poy.
who conducts a drug store at 824 Du
pont street, was visited "by a China
man about 23 years of age, who stated
that one of his relatives was seriously
ill and in need of the immediate ser
vices of a physician. The doctor ac
companied the man to the address
given. The guide entered a dark pas
sageway that leads to a rear court.
After crossing this yard and entering
another dwelling, Ng See Poy was
pounced upon by three Chinamen, who
beat him over the head with* the butt
end of a revolver, relieved him of his
cash and then' fired two shots into his
body. .
Patrolman Bert Wren was standing
at the corner of Jackson and Stockton
streets when the shooting occurred and
immediately ran to the scene. In the
inky darkness he was unable at first
to find the victim, but was at
tracted to him by his groans. The
wounded man was found lying at the
foot of a stairway, weltering In a pool
of blood. One of the bullets had pene
trated the left breast and the other
had lodged in the abdominal cavity.
Patrolmen McGrayan, C. W. Brown
and Collins and' Detective McMahon
were soon upon the scene and the
wounded man was removed to the hos
pital.
A search was then made for some
clew to the perpetrators of the crime
and the weapon with which the deed
was committed. A white man living
immediately in the rear of the house
In which the shooting occurred inform
ed Patrolman Wren that he had seen
a Chinaman come downstairs before the
crime and after the shots were fired
run upstairs. The officer, upon search
ing the building; found Ah Sam in an
upper room. The Chinamari was lying
in his bunk and complained of severe
intestinal pains. His" hat and coat were
on the floor, as if they had been hur
riedly discarded. As he failed to give
a satisfactory account of his move
ments during the evening he was taken
into custody, and in the excitement fol
lowing the arrest he forgot that he had
been feigning illness.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 26.â The Civil
Service Commission in its report to the
President for the fiscal year ended
June 30 last urges legislation retiring
superannuated Government employes.
It suggests that Congress provide that
the further admission of persons into
the classified service shall be based on
a condition that they uhall provide
against their own superannuation or
other disability by adequate annuity
insurance, the premiums to be deduct
ed from their salaries, and that super
annuation and disability annuities for
those now in the service should also
be provided for as far as possible by
similar deductions from salaries.
The commission notes a continued
improvement in the observance of the
civil service act and rules, and says
that few complaints appear to be well
founded. The report makes the fol
lowing reference to the postoffice in
vestigation:
"As a result of the investigation into
the conduct of business in the Post
office Department a number of officers
and employes of that department have
been indicted. An inspection of the
commission's record shows that none
of those indicted entered the service
through competitive examination. This
should be gratifying to the advocates
of the merit system, who hold that em
ployes secured through fair, open com
petition are likely to have a greater
degree of integrity as well as efficiency
than employes appointed under the
patronage system."

"geographical" Democrats it would be
much larger.
Referring to Boutell's statement
that Roosevelt would be the Repub
lican nominee, Williams said:
"You have gone' so far, you cannot
go back and you are going to stand
pat on him."
In answer to a question by Boutell,
Williams announced himself positively
on the silver question.
â¢ "Conditions are such that the silver
question has been relegated to the
rear," he declared, amid Democratic
applause.
Williams -explained that he was
speaking simply as a Representative
of the Eighth Mississippi District arid
for himself alone.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â Boutell
of Illinois addressed the House for
nearly two hours to-day in a reply to
statements made by Williams of Mis
sissippi, the minority leader, in his
"stand pat" speech of a few days ago.
Williams in turn replied to Boutell.
The House had under consideration
at the time the urgent deficiency bill.
Boutell received close attention of both
sides of the chamber and when he
spoke of the passing of the last trace
of bitterness between the North and
South he was loudly applauded on
both sides. Boutell was humorous
and grave, pathetic and poetic.
Williams in his reply was likewise
humorous. Befeiring to the Philip
pines, he said:
"If that is another thing you want
to stand pat on, stand pat, then, on
your un-American, old European
army, military camp, grab-nation pol
icy of an indefinite colonialism."
When Boutell had concluded Wil 7
liams crossed over and shook hands
with him, Boutell returning the com
pliment when Williams had concluded.
Boutell evoked laughter by liken
ing the Democratic party to characters
in Biblical history. Speaking of
Bryan's trip to Europe, he said Bryan
got an inspiration from Croker and
brought back an idea.
"You have still got William J.
Bryan to reckon with," he declared,
addressing himself to the minority side,
adding that Bryan again would play
the part of Nebuchadnezzar or the
part of Samson, and charged the
Democrats to see that he did not pull
down the pillar of their house and
again bring them into the position of
idolaters.
Boutell said the record of the Re
publican party would be its platform

Corner Powell and Eddytend the general conference c-f the
Episcopal church in October next In
Boston. ,
An amendment to the canons to pro
vide for a place on the board of direc
tors of the diocese of a Coadjutor Bish
op, if such be elected, was sent to the
committee on cknons to report upon.
Rev. E. L. Parsons of the standing
committee presented a report showing
the number of clergy ordained in the
last year in the diocese and also of
routine work accomplished.
TREASURER'S REPORT.
Treasurer Van Bokkelen presented his
annual report in printed form and cop
ies . were distributed among the dele
gates. The principal portions of
report showed the following:
Diocesan fund â Receipts, $7031; dis
bursements, $7026.
Missionary fundâ Receipts, $8585 46;
disbursements, $9102 30; excess of dis
bursements over income, $513 34.
Disabled clergy fund â Investments,
$21,399 12; year's income, $1165 05; dis
bursed, $034 37; balance forward, $530 t5S.
Widows' and orphans' fundâInvest
ments, $13,238 28; year's income, $586 75;
disbursed, $386 75.
Endowment fund â Investments, $16,
315 46; disbursed. $625 64. ; 1
. Treasurer Van Bokkelen addressed the
convention and severely criticized a
circular letter sent out by Rev. Dr.
McClure, secretary of the General
Clergy Relief Fund. The laws of the
church permit each diocese to handle
its own fund for the relief of the clergy,
though many of the dioceses turn in
such funds to the general fund, from
which it is apportioned. -
Treasurer Van Bokkelen stated that
the diocese of California did not de
'slre to join trie General Clergy Relief
Fund, and for that reason many unjust
comments had been made in the East.
He auoted figures to show that it was
better for the California diocese to han
dle its own fund for the relief of the
disabled ctergy in its district.
The committee on finance presented
a memorial deploring the death of Ma
jor W. B. Hooper, who for nine years
served as chairman of the committee.
The memorial was unanimously
adopted.
The committee on apportionment pre
sented its report, showing the amount
which had been assessed to each parish
and mission for- the support of the dio
cese and its expenses.
The convention ther/ adjourned until
this morning at 9:30. This evening the
delegates will enjoy a banquet at the
Palace Hotel, which will be followed
by a general reception to Bishop Nich
oil and his wife.

After six months* delay work has been
begun again on the -university build
ings. Stone' masons began work on
the arcades of the outer quadrangle
this morning, and it is reported that
another force of men will be put on

clerical and lay members of various
committees were presented to the con

The corporation/ of the diocese of
fered a resolution to add a new article
to the constitution reading as follows:

An amendment that no person be
considered a communicant of registered
or reported as such unless he has com
municated at least once within tho
year, was ordered referred to the com
mittee on canons.
The following amendments to the
canons were referred to the committee
on canons for further report:
* To provide for the extension of the
church and the establishment of Sun
day schools Within the boundaries of
existing parishes and missions when
ever it shall appear to the Bishop- of
the diocese that there is an opportunity
for such church extension.
To substitute the words "fund for
church extension in the diocese" for the
words "missionary fund of the dio
cese."'
To provide that at the annual con

assessed $25 by Justice Anderson for
the offense. During a recent trfp I.owe

Actress Edna Wallace Hopper, who
Js contesting the will of her step
father, the late Alexander Dunsmuir,
the? coal baron, in the courts of Vic
toria, B. C. arrived from the north
yesterday in company with her at
torney. Judge Coyne of Xew York, and
registered at the Palace. The case is
now being summed up by Â«tie counsel
on either side and a decision is ex
pected in the course of a few months.
The fact that the mother and sis
tÂ«rs of the late Alexander Dunsmuir
have joined the young actress in her
legal battle with the brother of the
deceased millionaire has strengthened
the hopes of Miss Hopper for a vic
tory. When her suit was first insti
tuted it was thought that the estate
of Alexander Dunsmuir amounted to
between two and three million dol
lars, but during the progress of the
trial it developed that the value of
the property will reach nearer ten
millions.
Miss Hopper and Judge Coyne leave
on this mornlng-'s train for New York.
In discussing: her case yesterday the
actress stated that in the event of a
decision b^ing rendered against her in
the Victoria court it is the plan of her
attorney to immediately carry the
case on appeal to the Dominion
courts, arid, if necessary, to the court
of last resort in England.

COMMITTEES APPOINTED.
Resolved, That a committee of five be ap
pointed whose duty It shall be to co-operate
with other religious' and secular organizations
of the State toward securing an amendment to
the constitution of the United States giving
Congress authority to legislate' In matters of
marrleee and divorce.
Whereas. We believe that this condition is
due in a great measure to the lack of uniformi
ty In the marriage and divorce laws -of the
several States of the Union; therefore, be It
Wherfac, This church views with concern
the great spread of divorce throughout the na
tion, striking at the sanctity of the home and
thereby destroying one of the strongest foun
dations of Christian virtue and patriotic citi
zenship; and.
At yesterday's proceedings a reso
lution was presented by Rev. H. H.
Powell of Santa Clara, which was as
follows:
Rev. M. Â«D. Wilson was elected to
serve as secretary, a position he occu
pied at preceding deliberations of the
diocese in conventions. George H.
Hooke was elected assistant secretary.
On motion of A'rchdeacon Emery
and L. M. Ringwalt a resolution was
carried that a clerical delegate be ap
pointed to assist the representatives of
the press.
Many of the lay delegates present
were women and they followed the
proceedings with considerable interest.
One of the most important matters
thatjeame up before the convention
was the question of marriage and di
vorce. At the General Conference,
held in this city in 1901, a contest was
waged against the recognition of any
divorced person, as a member of the
Episcopal church, the supporters of
the movement being victorious.
DEPLORES DIVORCES.
Bishop Nichols, who presided, wore
the robes of his office during the first
session of the convention. The call of
the roll of delegates showed that the
attendance was the largest of any an
nual convention of the diocese ever
held in California.
OPENS THE SESSION.
At the close of the religious service
the -vested .clergymen marched from
the church and doffed their stoles, re
turning- to the edifice to" take part in
the deliberations of the convention.
We Â»re to measure our church work by the
game class of world standards as those by
which California gauges everything else. Is
it a cathrdral? Then, it is to be of noble
dimension*, endowed liberally, so that through
Its vaulted an-hes shall ring the measured
fadfncpf of a proi*>r cathedral service, setting
the Ftandard of worship for the tHocese. HÂ»re
all tho work for church extension Is to find
its inspiration. â¢
Right nobly hes California acquitted her
self. Hut do we realize what all this taeans?
We have taken up burdens almost staggering
and have bonie them with a more Jaunty air
than even Atlas, had as he upheld the world.
Anplo-tfaxon California has done things in the
to-<iay.
The standards of our life are the standards
of the twentieth centuryâ we gauge ourselves
by the same measurement as do the New
Yorkers. We are not willing that the Hl"d
srd shall be lower. In business, in societ\V"Tn
art even, the standards of California are thÂ«?
world's standards. It is a notable ambition, a
right pj.Me. and we take up any challenge that
Comes within our range.
But it will be only light to lighten our
minds Into thu old way of truth; light to help
us leaJ the minds of this gem-ration to know
the old. old truth aa it is in Jesus and as this
chech *.as received the same.
We are to deepen the foundation of the
diocese of California and to enlarge its effect
iveness; to persirtenlly reach out. remember
ing the solidarity of the American church,
which reaches from the Atlantic to the 1'a
clfic and does not stoD with the Sierra?.
OLD WAY OF TRUTH.
Do we not stand between the Ultramontane
and the extreme Protestant, with Agnostic
and Calvanistic, Atheistic and Latitudinarlan
forces attacking us covertly or openly on all
sides? .
Are we not as a city set upon a hill in the
full view of men? I* there not, there
fort-, my brethren, need for this appeal to
steadfastness? Let this, then, be our keynote
â the old is true, and by God's grace we will
hold to that we know, We will have minds
open to any light that will help us, and we
will not despise any. source from which light
will come.
The crash and roar and tumult of new
voices are all about us. Some weak anii
timid souls occasionally lose faith and follow
after the new, simply because It seems to b<Â«
new â or, i>erhap?, because It Is easy, or, per
haps, because it seems to meet their momen
tary questionings.
Our duty is to stand firm for the faith once
delivered to the saints.
In an age of searching after new truth the
old truth remains. We may assimilate what
we wll! of new points 'of view, but our duty
is to remain steadfast to the old, because It Is
true.
All the clergy in attendance at the
convention wore their white stoles
during the morning service and a sur
pllced choir rendered the music, ac
companied by the organ, under the di
rection of Organist W. H. Holt.
The sermon was delivered by Rev.
Mardon D. Wilson, who said in part:
The convention was preceded by the
celebration of morning service and the
holy communion. Bishop W. F. Nichols
being the celebrant, assisted by Arch
deacon J. A. Emery and Deans Lewis,
Hansen and Shaw.
The fifty-fourth convention of the
Episcopal Church, Diocese of Califor
nia, convened yesterday morning at
Grace Church, California and Stockton
streets, a very large attendance of
clerical and lay delegates being pres
ent.
Judge Drake, the trial Judge, at the
conclusion of Davis' address asked him
to point out what standing Mrs. Hop
per had in court. She was not heiress
et-law. She was no relation, and he
coOld not see that she could have any
standing. Davis said he had not talked
of these points, having made his strong
plea on the soundness of Alexander
Dunsmuir's mind, and the lntervenor
having taken i>art in the case made it
unnecessary-
There were, Davis held, two Alexan
der Dunsmuirsâ one who went to his
business day by day and whom his as
sociates had never seen under the in
fluence of liquor, and Alexander Dun^
rnuir, drunkard and in abnormal con
dition.
VICTORIA. B. C. Jan. 26.â Argument
of counsel in the Hopper-Dunsmuir will
case commenced this morning. E. P.
Davis, K. C. for the defendant, after
quoting authorities on mental jurispru
dence and citing cases of valid wills
made by excessive drunkards, held that
thi? case was clearly one- of fact â a
matter of the credibility of witnesses.
He discredited the evidence of the
plaintiff, and said that other than three
physicians her witnesses were maids
and bellboy*.
The Rev. Edward L.. Parsons, the
Rev. F. W. Clampett, D. D-, and Bishop
Nichols each preached a sermon. The
Rev. Mr. Parsons said the church must
have a world policy. A natirm, he said,
might get on a while without one. as
America had done, but the time al
ways came when a nation had to ex
tend its affiliations. The church had
been born into the world to conquer the
uttermost ends. The church could
never pause, but went on as it had
been destined to do by the Lord and
Master.
The processional hymn, "Onward,
Christian Soldiers," was perhaps never
sung with greater vigor and enthusi
asm. The whole congregation joined
in singing the stirring sacred song.
The, service which followed was -per
formed by the Rev. J. A. O'Meara and
the Rev. Clifton Macon. Dean Lewis,
Dean Emery and Dean Shaw assisting.
In the great processional of some
hundreds, consisting of the united
choirs and clergy in their vestments,
was Bisheo Nichols and the venerable
Dr. J. B. Wakefield, who is in his eight
ieth year. Dr. Wakefleld had at his
side the Rev. Dr. Kelley. - -
Last night there was a great rally at
Trinity Church, Bush and Gough
streets, when a general missionary
meeting was held with choral service,
the united vested choirs of San Fran
cisco and vicinity taking part under
the direction of Wallace A. Sabin of
St. Luke's Church.
Accompanying the petition is the affi
davit of F. S. Granger, manager of the
Interurban Company, in which it 13
set forth that the road on North Mar
ket street is part of a seventeen-mile
system Just about completed by the
Interurban Company, and that if it is
in any manner prevented from complet
ing the North Market street line it will
be Impossible to operate any part of
the system and will Incur great loss
and inflict on the company great and
irreparable injury and greatly deterio
rate the value of it3 bond3.
The crossing over the railroad at San
Carlos street was completed to-night.
A ciir has been chartered for to-morrow
night to take a party out to Sorosid.
near Saratoga. That will be the first
trip over that part of the road. Thurs
day morning the city service of the In
terurban Railway will be put into ef
fect. This will run from the broad
gauge depot to the Meridian road, and
the line will have a seven-minute ser
vice.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 26.â The compli
cated litigation now existing over the
electric railway on North Market street
between the Interurban Company and
the San Jose and Santa Clara Electric
Railway was added to to-day by tha
petition for another injunction. Thte
time It is the Interurban Company that
has invoked the aid of the law.
The court is asked to direct the San
Jose and Santa Clara Company to ap
pear in court next Friday morning: and

PENDLETON, Or., Jan. 26. â The
bodies of Mr. and Mrs. John T. Brown
of Reinbeck, Iowa, were found in the
hills south of town to-day. Mrs.
Brown had been shot in the breast,
and, the bullet failing to take effect,
her throat had been cut from ear to
ear with a razor. Brown had shot
himself in. the head and to make death
certain had swallowed poison.
'The Browns came here some time
ago from Iowa. On failing to arouse
them this morning Mr. and Mrs. E. L.
Smith, with whom the couple had been
stopping for two weeks, entered their
room and found a note saying that
both were tired of life and agreed to
die together. The note left directions
as to where the bodies would be found,
and following the instructions, the
Sheriff succeeded in locating the scene
of the tragedy. The couple left a
number of sealed letters addressed to
various persons, one being to Mrs. M.
A. Brown of Reinbeck and another to
Thomas ' Brown of Summerfleld, Kans.
Mrs. Brown had addressed a letter:'
"Dear Brother â When this ' reaches
you I will be no more. I have found
another man- in Oregon I -love better
than my husband."
'Her letter had been torn and thrown
into a stove,: but failed to burn and
was picked out by the Coroner and
pasted together/ It is believed now
that Brown murdered his wife and
then killed himseif.
VENTURA, Jan. 26.â Shortly after S
o'clock this evening Harry and Ruth
Browne were accidentally shot at the
Browne residence on^ r entura avenue,Â«
one mile from this city. The children,
aered 15 and 9 years, were alone in tho
house at the time. They are the young
est daughter and son of a former Au
ditor and Recorder, A. W. Browne.
Mrs. Browne was visiting at the Binn's
house. The other members of the fam
ily were downtown.
A noise at the window startled the
girl. 'It was thought that a burglar
was attempting 1 . to enter the house.
Harry and Ruth both rushed to their 1
mother's bedroom for a revolver. It
was not supposed to be loaded. Harry
was breaking the weapon in order to
load it. There was a cartridge in the
barrel and it was discharged. The bul-'
let passed through the fleshy part of
Harry's left hand. Then it entered his
sister's breast bver the heart, striking
a rib. The ball glanced, followed the
rib and lodged under the left arm.
Dr. Cunnane,' the attending: surgeon,
says that the . girl had a narrow
escape from instantaneous death. She
is now under the influence of opiates.
The bullet will be extracted to-mor
row. â¢ Immediately after the accident
the .lad ran to his mother at Binn's
residence.'' He left a trail of blood both
going and returning.

"When we left the bottom of the
shaft there were. twelve bodies lying
there ready" to be brought up. There
are many others there, and the bodies
of many will never be found. :
"The south main drift, In which we
worked, gives little chance for many of
the men there being recognized.
"In the north main drift the way
has been cleared for some distance, but
we could not tell what was found
there."
Just after 10 o'clock the last of the
rescuers were brought to the surface.
Some bodies will be brought out be
fore daybreak.
"It was a frightful experience. We
were too cold to work. There is ap
parently no one to rescue. We had a
hard time to find any of the dead. A
shred of clothing here and another
there, a jacket, a pair of overalls, but
few bodies.
Shortly after they were let down,
two at a time, in the bucket, a tem
porary hoist that had been rigged up
to Oifcg up the debris and -the v dead
was started down the sha'ft. Then came
the enow and cold and wind. Agafn and
again efforts were made',to reach the
living men at the bottom of the shaft,
but the -wooden sides of v the hoist,
swollen by water, stuck ;to 'the. iron
guide slide, and Ithe'n came i hours of
maneuvering -.to reach .the 1 bottom.
The men*below had , no .means; of
warmth and. many of -them, were stand
ing in deep water. Every effort \ was
made to .lower the cage, 'and !flnally, it
was, loosened and got within, twelve
f eet . of the % , bottom. A-'" timber â¢ blown
across the way by' the explosion wasin
the path. The^meri were .within' easy
each -of a rope*, but :
numbed'and almost frozen v by the. cold,
were unable to grasp the s offered help.
It was 9'o'clock when, the first ! three
men of the party who went down at
3 o'clock were brought to the surface.
Not one of them- was able to walk."" ""
Henry Beckert said:
PITTSBURGH Jan;*-26;^Almost zero
weather and a biting, wind late in the
afternoon swept over the little valley

and nearly added another list of dead
to the long black table. Not only was
the work of. search for the dead and
living, if any are still alive, rudely in
terrupted, but cold and ice and wind
combined nearly cost the lives, of six
teen more men.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon sixteen
men went down into the shaft to do the
work of bratticing, bolstering, tunnel
ing and removing the debris that has
so far barred their progress into the
workings where the men were at
work when the explosion came. Their
shift was supposed to be of three hours
only. Even at that it was a hard
task. Even before the bucket. reached
the bottom they were drenched with
water, which the cold draught through

Their arms and bodies were mangled,
their heads crushed and their clothing
stripped from their bodies: At the bot

water, and into this the cage plunged.
Seme of the miners were carried with
the cage into this sump.
VICTIMS ARE XOX-UXIOX MEX.
Nearly all of the men killed had wives
and children. Harry Goegen leaves a
wife and three children, who are in
Michigan. TV. B. Collins was a Baptist
minister and preached on Sundays at
Goldfield. He was 38 years of age and
came from Cornwall. England. Edward
Twlgrgs and Frank Cochrane were from
the Coeur d'Alenes.
Frank Gellese, the engineer In charge
of the machinery when the accident
occurred, surrendered himself to the
military and was locked up in the bull
pen. Gellese is a newcomer in the dis
trict, but is said to have been strongly
recommended as a competent engineer.
Most of the victims of the accident
were strangers in the district, having
come from the Coeur d'Alenes, the
Lake Superior mines and other districts
to take the places of strikers in Cripple
Creek.
At a late hour to-night only, one body
that could be identified had been taken
from the shaft. It was that of Harry
Goegen, and was terribly mutilated.
Fragments of four or more bodies were
recovered from the various levels and
many articles of clothing which were
torn from the falling men were found.
An investigation of the causes has
been going on to-night, three expert
engineers having been called in to ex
emine the machinery: but newspaper
representatives as well as the public
have been rigidly excluded by the mine
officers in control.

CAGE CRASHES DOWN* SHAFT.
In the main shaft of the mine six
; t*<?n men were being hoisted in the
cage from the six, seventh and eighth
I lrvels. When the cage got to the sur
' face in the shafthouse the engineer
' was unable to stop the engine and the
CHjre with its load of human freight was
| drawn up into the gallows frame, where
' Jt became lodged temporarily. The
strain on the cable caused it to part,
releasing the cage, which went down
the shaft at terrific momentum. Two
" of the occupants of the cage, however,
had become entangled with the timber
rr>ds near the top of the gallows frame
and one of them, L. P. Jackson, was
crushed to death by the sheave wheel
frJlinc upon him. The other, James
Bullbck. had a marvelous escape from
death, but received painful injuries.
He was rescued from his perilous posi
tion by mÂ»n in the shafthouse.
The shift boss and a number of
miners went down into the mine
through another compartment of the
chaft and found that all the men who
started with the cage on its wild flight
of 1500 feet to the bottom of the shaft
were dead, their bodies being scattered

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Jan.
26. â George Adderson, the aged over
seer of buildings, who is in charge of
Encina Hall, the men's dormitory, is
having his troubles.
The board of trustees ordered Ad
derson to confiscate all kerosene
lamps found in the possession of the
students living at Encina. As the
electric lights are cut off at 10:30
o'clock each night, an extremely early
hour for students who. are frequently
obliged to burn the midnight oil. the
Encina men occasionally resort to
the use of kerosene lamps after the
electric current is shut off.
The overseer of Encina did not
trust the work of seizing the larnDs to
his corps of Japanese assistants, but
made a personal room to room search
of Encina's 490 apartments and col
lected a large number of lamps,
which he cached in a basement room!
Several of the Encina men put their
heads together and decided to regain
their property. They proceeded to
the basement and with a small bar
pried the lock and staple off the door.
Not only did they find their lamps

terial from thirty old plays that were
presented in the religious, houses and
in the streets of England 600 years ago.
He is an authority on the old English
drama, being now engaged on a work
dealing with the subject, and so has
had access to many works.
It is interesting to know that the
play was staged under the direction
of Ben Greet, manager- of the company
of English players that, presented
"Everyman" and "Twelfth Night" at
the university so successfully last sum
mer. It was this same; English com
pany that presented .' the. play. It has
been in preparation ;f or some time and
even Professor Gayley ; was . not in
formed of the progress of the arrange

informed him that the play. was about
to be- given. , <*. : .Â¦ .
Professor Charles Mills Gayley, head
of the department of English at the

founded on the Bible story and dealing*
with the nativity, the passion and the

Without losing presence of mind, the
women grabbed blankets and gave bat
tle to the fire, smothering the flames
and at last extinguishing the blazing
fluid.
A still alarm called out nearby fire
department apparatus, but the women
flre fighters had done their work so
well that - the firemen found nothing
for them to do. The damage was
slight. Fire Wcrden George McDonald
said the women's prompt and vigorous
handling of the flre undoubtedly saved
their home from destruction.
With peril to themselves, Mrs. E. L.
Muller and Miss Florence Muller,, moth
er and daughter, fought a flre and
saved their residence, 962 Seventh ave
nue, from destruction last-night. The
women were burned on the hands, the
injuries being painful. but, fortunately,
not serious.
The accidental overturning of a coal
oil stove caused the fire. Flaming oil
ran over the room and was attacking
the woodwork when Mrs. Muller and
her daughter were warned of their dan
ger.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Jan. 26.
These statements are official and are
from officers of the companies inter
ested.
The application for a franchise along
the eastern bank of Lake Merritt and
connecting with the main line of the
Twelfth street system at the dam is ex
plained by the officers of the company
as merely an effort to secure a new out
let for the Fourth avenue line. This at
present connects with the Fifth avenue
system at East Eighteenth street. It
is now to be run over a private right
of way to connect with the main
Ttvelfth street system at about First
avenue and the eastern end of the Lake
Merritt dam. No work will be done
upon this until next spring, when all of
the East Oakland lines will be recon
structed.
The lines are admittedly in bad con
dition, but will only be kept up until
next spring, when probably they will
be changed to a gauge that will har
monize with that of the newer portions
of the system.
Aside from these two pieces of work
nothing definite has been decided upon
by either company, and nothing will be
begun until the winter rains are over.
The Oakland Transit Company will
be compelled to pay some attention to
its East Oakland and crosstown Oak
land lines very shortly. These lines are
all narrow gauge, and the company
docs not wish to spend Â»ny money for
permanent repairs until the tracks have
be*Â»n made broad gauge.
GAUGE WILL BE CHANGED.
The Piedmont extension of the Key
Route system will be completed at
once. The road is built nearly to
Broadway, and it is now only neces
sary to make the connection between
Broadway and Piedmont avenue. There
is a considerable hill at this point, and
the original plans of the company were
to mount the hill on a regular street.
Surveys show that though this would
not be impossible, it would be difficult,
and so a private right of way was pur
chased, it being the intention to put
the road through on a level with the
aid of a tunnel. It is now said that the
tunnel plan has been abandoned and
that a deep cut will be made. As soon
as the method by which this hill will
be overcome is definitely settled work
will be begun on the Piedmont connec
tion.
The first work that will be done is
the extension along University avenue
in Berkeley to the water front. Work
upon this extension will be commenced
in a week or two.
PIEDMONT EXTENSION.
There are only two pieces of woilc
that the Oakland Transit Company nnd
the Key Route system have definitely
settled upon and which will be carried
out at once. The first is the building of
an extension of the tJniversity avenue
system in Berkeley from the 4 present
terminus at San Pablo avenue to the
water front along University avenue,
and the other piece of work is the con
necting up of the Fortieth street line
from its present terminus a little east
of Telegraph avenue with the Piedmont
line.
There have been many rumors re
garding the intentions of these two
companies, which are controlled by the
same men and the same officials, but
the facts are that until the winter is
over there will be very little new con
struction on anv of these lines.

The youths will only admit that they
beat their way from Nev.- York to Cal
ifornia, but the impression of the police
Is that they have been swindling and
committing burglaries en route.
An additional felony charge of break
ing Jail will be placed against the
prisoners.
The two young fellows managed to
hide a caseknife last night when they
were served with dinner and with that
they cut out the lock of the jail door,
which was fastened on wood, and es
caped.
They started for Oakland and landed
in Fruitvale this morning. In the
meantime Constable Broderick of Nilos
had telephoned to the Oakland police
and Officers Andrews and Thompson
arrested the escaped burglars In Fruit
vale. They admitted their identity and
will be turned over to Constable Brod
erick. . ,
When James and Williams were ar
rested they had several kinds of swind
ling devices upon therru They "had a
lot of skeleton keys, keys for slot ma
chines and some Confederate paper
money and Civil War 10-cent paper
money, folded so that only the "10"
showed.
The burglars who held the Niles
prison in such light esteem are Pearl
James and David Williams, youths who
say they came recently from the East
and Who, from articles found in their
possession, had evidently started out
deliberately on a career of crime.
One night last week James and Wil
liams entered the store of Jackson &
Easterby at Niles and took everything
that they could \ find, including some
Jewelry and about $15 in money that
they got from some slot machines.
They then beat their way to Pleasan
ton, where they were arrested by Con
stable Locke and sent back to Niles.
OAKLAND, Jan. 26. â There was a
jailbreak.at Niles last night. Two
prisoners charged with burglary es
caped, but they were recaptured at
Fruitvale and will : be sent back. The
Niles constable thinks that by nallins
up the door of the calaboose and tying
a dog in front of it as an extra precau
tion he can hold the prisoners until
they, are given a preliminary hearing.

It was decided at a meeting of the
Beard "cf Education to-tfiight to aban
don the .idea of calling a school bond
election separate and distinct from the
proposed municipal bond election, and
to Join the interest of the* schools with
that of the city in general.
For several months the board has
been workinc with the idea, of calling
an election to vote bonds foe 5950,000
for school improvement uncier what is
known as the district plan. "UJnder this
plan certain sections outsidd the city
limits* could be included.
The reason for the change of front in
the position of the Board of Education.
it avas explained during the discussion
of tlie question to-night, was the elim
ination of the water question from the
proposed municipal bond eletsUon.
Another argument used in ;favor of
joining Issues with the Council was the
fact that it would have been the first
aÂ«emp.t to call an election under the
district plan in the State and. it was
Questionable whether the bonds could
be "disposed of until the Supreme Court
had passed upon them.
After a thorough discussion Â¦ of the
subject, the board instructed fits com
mittee* to meet the, special; com
mittee of the City Council to-morrow
nighf. with power to Join the issues
providing that the election be not de
layed and that Sl.or.0.000 for school pur
poses be included in the call for it.

plDÂ£ In front of theaterSamuel Marks, secretary of the Pa
cific Mutual Life Insurance Company,
from which Soeder obtained the acci
dent and life insurance policies on the
life of Blaise, testified as to the pro
ceedings leading up to the issuance of
the policies.
Marks said that Blaise made applica
tion for an accident policy for $3000,
making Leon Soeder the beneficiary.
Soeder was put down as the brother
in-law of Blaise. Soeder made a simi
lar application for a like policy, with
Joseph Blaise as the beneficiary. Marks
had 1 no means of telling that the ap
plication for the policies was made by
Blaise, but believed it merely on the
word of Soeder, who acted as spokes
man. Blaise, he said, was not present
at the time the policies were asked for
by Soeder, but was waiting in an ad
joining room. Marks did not know
whether Blaise was cognizant of the
fact that Soeder was to be the bene-
beard on his face and looked worn. He
tried to assume an unconcerned air and
glanced at the various witnesses he
knew prior to his incarceration In the
City Prison. He took a seat between
his attorneys and listened intently to
the testimony of the witnesses.
During the hearing Soeder, who was
sitting right in front of the two girls
who came with him from Germany on
the steamer La Touraine, glanced
around at them several times, hoping,
it seemed, to get a nod of recognition
from them, but they looked over his
head.
XEIBLAS' POOR MEMORY.
Joseph Neiblas, Soeder's and Blaise's
former landlord, was placed on the
stand. Neiblas gave a broken account
of his knowledge and had a discon
nected memory of the true facts of the
case. He would talk for a few minutes
and then lapse into a comatose state
and appear to be in dreamland. It was
with great difficulty that Coroner Le
land was able to get an intelligent an
swer from him. First he would deny
that >.e knew anything about what he
was being asked, and a moment later,
by some deft questioning. Dr. Leland
would compel him to admit the very
fact that he had but a moment before
denied knowledge of.
His testimony was merely a repeti
tion of what has already been pub
lished. He had not seen the dead man
alive after 11 o'clock on Sunday morn
ing, January 10. He ! egan to relate
his suspicions of Soeder, and said that
individual had impressed him as acting
very mysteriously the last week before
Blaise was murdered. He was forced
to admit that he had never thought
anything wrong of Soeder"^ actions un
til he looked back over the occurrences
after Soeder had been arrested for the
murder.
That oortion of Neiblas' testimony
which was intelligible was as follows:
"At 6:30 on the morning that the body
of Blaise was discovered, Soeder came
to our room and said he feared that
Blaise had lost his way or had been
robbed, as he had not come home all
night. He said Blaise had considerable
money on his person. I was in bed
when he came to the room and did not
see his face. I heard him leave the
house a few minutes later and he did
not return until 12 o'clock at noon. In
the meantime the newspaper men and
the detectives had called and told me
that Blaise was dead. I told Soeder
that Blaise was dead and he said,
'Go on, great God.* I told him that the
detectives had left word for him to
call at the office of the'fchief of Police.
He went out again and did not come
back until .3 o'clock. I asked him if he
had seen the spot where Blaise was
murdered and he replied that he had
seen it several times.
"His manner was unconcerned. He
went into his room and sat at the table
writing a letter. When he had finished
he left the house, saying he was going
to the Mission to 6ee some friends, and
told me that if any one called to
say he would return at 7 o'clock. He
was back at 7 o'clock and stayed but a
minute. After he had gone Detective
GiJtson came to the house and told us
that Soeder was suspected of having
been the murderer of Blaise."
Neiblas told of the propositions Soeder
had made to him to go to the house of
Miss Flatley and attempt to regain the
jewels Soeder had given her. He then
began a recitation of his sleuthlike
work in discovering the broken" gera
nium bush and footprints, but the Cor
oner could not see the importance of
his talk and dismissed him, and called
Mrs. Neiblas to the stand.
Mrs. Neiblas' testimony was in the
main a corroboration of her husband's.
She seemed dazed and talked discon
nectedly. She said she had seen the two
men, Soeder and Blaise, when they
went out to dinner. "It was about 4:40
o'clock," she said, "because I had Just
lighted the lamps, and it has been my
custom of late, when the days have
been short, to light the lamps about
that time. A few minutes after they
had gone the clock struck 5."
Charles S. Vose, Dennis Collins and
Bernard Boland, Union street carmen,
were placed on the stand to tell about
the excited German they saw at 8:20
o'clock on the night of the murder.
Coroner Leland could not see the im
portance of their testimony in the case
and dismissed them as unimportant
witnesses. None of them could identify
Soeder or the picture of Blaise. They
had merely reached the conclusion that
the man they directed to Jackson street
was possibly Blaise, because he was a
German and excited. Collins said the
man they saw had a week's growth ot
beard on his face, while the dead man's
face was almost absolutely clean. He
said he did not think the man , was
Blaise. Vose testified that he had no
ticed the man merely because his boss,
Collins, had thought the circumstance
peculiar. Their testimony was useless,
as Blaise was dead, as has been shown
by medical testimony, at the time that
they saw the German.
BLAISE'S LAST MEAL.
Maria Vallarta, who with her sister
conducts the Original Mexican restau
rant at 721 Broadway, was next placed
on the stand. She was the. one who last
saw 'Blaise alive, as he left her restau
rant in company with Soeder- an hour
or so before the murder took place. The
woman had previously stated 1 to Detec
tive Gibson that Soeder and Blaise left
the restaurant at 7:30 o'clock. At the
inquest she changed this to 6 or 6:15
o'clock. Detective Gibson says he be
lieves she has been Influenced by
friends of Soeder. He argues that her
sister was formerly a habitue of the
tenderloin, and she may have been
warned to change her testimony by
some of Soeder's friends in that quarter
of the city. -
The witness said Soeder and Blaise
came into the restaurant while it was
yet light on the Sunday night that
Blaise was murdered, and she fixed the
time at 5:30 o'clock, She told . of the
foods they, had eaten, and said that the
two left the restaurant together at 6 or
6:15 o'clock.
If # Miss Vallarta ia Â¦ right in her
estimation of the time, Blaise met, his
death between 7:30 and 8 o'clock on that
fatal Sunday night.

PRINCIPAL WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED AT THE INQUEST HELD OVER THE REMAINS BY CORO
NER LELAND YESTERDAY.
HERMANN OEL.RICHS TEIXS
OF THE FAIR COMPROMISE
Canners and others concerned In
handling large quantities of asparagus
are much disturbed because of a re
port that the asparagus pest known
as rust has so ravaged the roots of
the asparagus in large fields in Cali
fornia that there will be a great short
age during the coming .'season. Cer
tain wholesale houses arc reported' to
have refused to take any orders for
delivery except with an "if," the un
certainty being relative to their ability
to secure the goods. , The rust was
known in certain localities last year
in this State. In past years it has al
most entirely destroyed the asparagus
crop in large sections in the Eastern
States. The pest has been so bad that
where it appeared the roots of the
asparagus were badly affected by the
secc-nd year. In some instances in the
East the plants have been entirely ex
terminated. *
Quarantine Officer Craw said last
evening that a strong attempt was
made to keep out the roots and seeds
of asparagus from abroad. The grow
ers had been forbidden to import either
seeds or roots, but the direction had
probably been evaded in some in
stances. Â«The rust was a serious men
ace In the Eastern States not long ago
and seeds may have been brought into
California from 'the East. Mr. Craw
said that it was probably too early in
the season to ascertain what effect the
rust was having in California. The pest
has diminished in the Eastern States
and conditions for asparagus growers
there are better than they were a few
years a so.
The asparagus business of California
has assumed large proportions in the
last two or three years. Hundreds of
cars laden with the vegetable have
been sent East since the trade abroad
was started. For a time rust did not
appear in California. The troubles of
Eastern agriculturists served to deter
them from engaging In asparagus cul
ture on their former large scale. This
naturally led to the extension of the
California market. In the southern
part c-f the State and in the islands in
the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
many thousands of dollars have been
Invested in asparagus farms. The an
nual receipts have been very large and
included a handsome margin of profits.
Mr, Craw's statement that it is too
early to tell what effect the rust has
had upon the asparagus plants that are
just about sprouting will probably tend
to have a conservative effect upon the
persons that are engaged in the busi
ness.

ficiary in the policies applied for.
The witness told of the application
of the two men for a policy of $10,000.
in which .Mrs. Blaise was to be made
beneficiary. Marks said Soeder had
first sent a note to the company's of
fice, asking that a man be sent to the
house at S27 Jackson street, or that
literature on the subject of life insur
ance be sent him. This, he said, was
an uncommon thing In the life insur
ance business, as the bulk of the poli
cies were secured by strenuous solici
tation.
J. W. Fowler, the agent who wrote
the accident policies for Soeder and
Blaise, was not present at the inquest.
Edward H. Osborne, the agent who
wrote the $2000 policy on the life of
Blaise, testified as follows: "Air. Fow
ler told me that Soeder and*Blaise, for
whom he had issued accident policies,
desired some life insurance. I went
to the rooms and found Soeder and
Blaise there. I asked them whether
they wanted a $1000 or a $2000 policy.
Soeder spoke . up and said that they
wanted a $10,000 policy. On learning
they were cooks I thought the request
for a $10,000 policy was going beyond
their means. But when I asked for
a deposit 'Sseder produced a roll of
greenbacks and my apprehension was
allayed. This was on the morning of
December 22. Soeder had previously
sent a letter to the office, asking that
some one call, as he wanted some life
insurance. This looked like an easy
way of getting the privilege of writing
a policy, and Fowler and I went to
gether.
ALLOWED ONLY $3000.
"When Soeder said that he wanted a
510,000 policy, I immediately asked for
a deposit. In response to his query as
to whether I wanted $50 or $100. I re
plied that $50 would be sufficient to
bind the contract. I told him that the
annual premium on a $10,000 poticy
would be $342, and he said that made
no difference. He told me at the time
that he had a policy in the New York
Life Company. The examining doctor
for the company was -with me, and
Blaise was found to be in good physical
condition. i
The application was sent to the home
office of the company and was returned
with a refusal to- assume the respon
sibility of $10,000 on a man's life who
had no other income than that derived
from his occupation as a cook. All that
they wc-uld allow on Blaise's life was
$3000. A policy for this amount was
issued to Soeder, and our dealings with
him were closed. The premium on the
$3000 policy was $102 60."
John M. Kilgarif, agent of the Pa
cific Mutual Life Insurance Company,
who received the payment for the poli
cies issued by the company to Soeder
and Blaise, was not present, so the
Cc-roner could not ascertain whether
Soeder or Blaise paid for the policies,
but it is known that Soeder paid for
them, as . he did for everything that
Blaise purchased.
The assistant medical director for the
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company
testified to examining Blaise and stated
that it was not on account of any
physical disability that the full $10,000
policy was refused him.
Dr. A. C. Bothe. city chemist, was
the last witness. He repeated his re
port, fixing the hour of death of Blaise.
He said: "I examined the contents of
the dead man's stomach, which were
given to me by Autopsy Surgeon Baci
galupi. There were no poisons present.
Not more than an hour and a half or
two hours at the utmost could have
elapsed between the time of the eating
of the food and the subsequent arrest
of digestion."
Detective Thomas Gibson was not
called on to testify, but was subpe
naed to dictate to Coroner Leland the
order in which the various witnesses
should be summoned.
Gibson is still working on the case
and claims to have some new wit
nesses that will testify to Blaise's ut
ter ignorance of the fact that his
brother-in-law, Soeder, was .made a
beneficiary in any of the policies
which were taken out on his life. Gib
son says that Blaise believed at the
time the applications were made for
policies that his wife in Germany was
to be the beneficiary.
Gibson also claims to have located
the man who took Soeder's gray suit
to the cleaning establishment. He will
will not say whether that man i3 Nei-
The Coroner's inquest into the death
of Joseph Blaise, who was murdered on
the night of January 10, was begun
yesterday morning. Several witnesses
were examined, but little headway was
made, owing to the length of time taken
up by gome of the witnesses and the
absence of others.* The inquest began
at 10:30 o'clock and was continued un
til 1 o'clock, when It was adjourned to
a.n indefinite date, dependent upon the
length of the preliminary hearing of
Leon Soeder, accused of the murder,
Â¦which begins in Judge Cabaniss' court
this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
The inquest was begun despite the
protests of Detective Gibson, who has
bad the murder case in Hand. Gibson
was wroth yesterday when subpenaed
to appear before the Coroner's jury.
He claimed that he was not ready to
tell what he knew of the case, not hav
ing- yet completed the gathering of evi
dence from the various witnesses lie
has discovered.
Gibson says he went to Coroner Le
land in the morning and asked him to
defer the inquest until after the pre
liminary hearing in the Police Court.
His excuse was that he had not yet
completed his chain of evidence and
had discovered several new witnesses
from whom he had to secure valuable
testimony before the hearing in the
Police Court. He says he will be kept
busy getting- his case into shape to
present at the preliminary hearing. Le
land, he asserts, refused his request
and said that the inquest must go on.
OVERLOOKED BY POLICE.
Coroner Leland said that he had
Boupht to confer with the police on
several occasions and his appeals to
Captain of Detectives Martin to set a
date for the inquest had been wasted
en deaf ears. "I felt," said Leland,
"that it was only proper that the in
c.u**Ft be held before the preliminary
hearing. There is no fixed rule in t^
eard to this, but it is an unwritten rule
that has been observed t>y the various
Coroners who have held this office."
Two of the jurors, Charles Hoover
end \V. J. McCreery. were unable to be
j-resent. so the inquest was begun be
lore seven jurors.
William Hogan, a millhand. residing
at 1112'i Vallejo street, was the first
witness called. Hogan testified to the
finding of the body on the morning of
January 11. lie said he was going to
w-<rk on the mornirtg mentioned tit
*bout 8:30 o'clock. Oh reaching the
corner of Vallejo and Taylor streets
he noticed a man lying half way down
the block on the Taylor street cut
through Russian Hill. "I went down
t*. where he was lying," said Hogan,
"and kicked him. thinking that he was
drunk. When I kicked the man in the
lops the whole body shook. Seeing that
The man was evidently dead I notified
Serjeant Christianson. who lives but
half a block away. The sergeant ex
nmincd the body and concluded when
he saw the cut in the neck that the
man had been murdered. There was 30
blood scattered around and what blood
we saw had sunk into the earth be
neath the cut on the man's neck. I
noticed no signs of a struggle in the
vicinity where Blaire's body lay."
NO SIGN" OF STRUGGLE.
Hosan thought the dead body was
lying three and a half feet from the
stone wall when found, but his esti
mate of the distance was not in accord
ance with that of Detective Armstrong.
Detective Armstrong testified that he
was detailed on the case the morning
the dead body of Blaise was discov
ered. He said "I found Blaise's body
lying with the head toward the wall
?nd the feet toward the east. It was
about two feet from the wall by accu
rate measurement. There was a pool
of blood on the ground beneath the
neck, which had a gaping wound in it.
From the appearance of the wound JI
uurmiped that the unfortunate man had
been stabbed. I searched for a knife
or other weapon, but found none.
There was no evidence of a struggle,
nn cuts on the hands, only the wound
en the neck and a laceration of the
*ralp. The trousers pockets were
turned inside out and were quite stiff,
leading me to infer that the body had
been lying there some time, probably
all night, as the clothes had absorbed
th* 1 dew and were stiff." '
At this juncture Soeder, who had not
yet appeared, arrived in the room, es
corted by Detectives Coleman and
Eilva. He had several days' growth of

A CONVERSATION' WITH A CLIMAX
Wlien a Professional Man Talks It's
to the Point.
Several famous American physicians
and surgeons were recently dining to-
pether after a session of a national
meeting held In New York.
â¢'I had a remarkable case this win-
ter," remarked a surgeon present,
Â¦whose name as a specialist in rectal
diseases is world wide. "My patient was
a woman, a delicate, nerve-racked crea-
ture, who had suffered so fearfully from
the ravages of hemorrhoids that the
knife seemed the only solution of the
trouble, and yet her heart was weak
and her strength so wasted by this
fearful disease that we dared not op-
erate.
"I had ceased my visits to her for a
time and had given up all hope, when
on* morning she entered my office look-
ing like a new v.oman; the pallor had
disappeared and the lines of suffering
wen? nearly eradicated from her face.
Shp told me she had bought at a drug
store for 50 cents a proprietary medi-
cine in suppository, form called Pyra-
mid Pile Cure, and had obtained instant
relief from the first insertion. I made
an examination and found the rectum
in excellent condition, the inflammation
entirely disappeared and the swollen
veins in normal condition.
"I "was so interested in the case that
I had the remedy analyzed carefully,
and was so Â»">leased with the result of
the analysis, finding a combination of
the most healing and scientific reme-
dies present in the Pyramid Pile Cure
and in a more convenient form than\I
could secure them otherwfce, that I
wrote to the Pyramid Drug Company
at Marshall. Mich., asking for their
booklet on Piles, their Nature, Cause
and Cure (which* by the way. is sent
free), and have since used their Pile
Cure extensively and with best results
in my practice. I do not hesitate to
recommend it to you all. It will often
Â«ave your patient from a painful surgi-
cal operation, which in many cases re-
sults fatally." Â¦â¢'-;

they never had such a demand for a new

worthy of the careful attention of thinking men. On the
one hand it is proposed to reclaim vast wastes and liter
ally to "make the desert blossom as the rose" by the ap
plication of water flowing in ditches and irrigating oth
erwise dry sands. On thei other hand, the agriculturists
at the head of a national department seek to wash por
tions of other great "deserts" clear of the objectionable
substances now in the soils that are a preventive of
strong vegetation. Â¦
T. P. Means of the Bureau of Soils of the United
States Department of Agriculture is conducting an agri
cultural experimental drainage farm in the Salt River
valley in Arizona. He says that 'demonstration is better
for the farmers than tons of reports and manuals, so
experiments are being* tried with various crops, includ
ing citrus fruits. Mr. Means says that some of the crops
that are common in the valley of. the; Nile ought to do
well in the Salt River valley. He believes Arizona will
yet put out a good grade of cotton, but there is the
alkali in the soil that has first to be eliminated.

It is not at all necessary (nor at all
likely) that it should mean the same
thing to both. Even grown people
rarely interpret music alike, and itj
grandeur and breadth is shown in that
very thingâ that, one piece of music
may suggest an entirely different pic
ture to each person in a vast audience,
and yet' the picture in the mind of each
will be absolutely correct and not con
flict with the idea of the composer
either. It is all according to the mind
of the listener â a broad, receptive mind
will see things in a large way, will re
ceive an impression of greatness and
nearness to nature in music like Bee
thoven's, where a smaller soul will see
only what his mind can grasp. '
Some children are born with musical
insight and some have to- acquire it.
In either case they should be helped and
encouraged to give their views and
ideas in regard to what they hear, and
should be listened to with unfailing
attention by. their elders, for it is not
easy for them at first to acquire the
habit of putting what they feel into
words, and they must be made to un
derstand that the doing of it is worth
while, and that "mother" is interested,
heart and soul, in the music as it is
interpreted by her little Doy.

Nowadays memorizing is reduced to a
science, and even the pupil who has no
natural aptitude in that direction will
be able, if he follows my instruction
carefully, to memorize unfailingly.
The natural method of memorization
is by the ear. That is. a persnn hears a i
tune, and immediately it seems to sing:
itself into his mini without any con
scious effort on his part. This is a
most Celightful way of memorizing,
but It is also apt to prove very unrelia
ble, and the music is liable to desert
one at the wrong moment. Forfnstanoe,
â¢if a pianist who relies upon his ear
* alone is ploying before a number of
jt'eople and becomes nervous his mem
â¢Â«>ry may fail him. A tittle nervousness,
a : littl" lark of concentration, a moment
of absent-mindedness and all is lost.
â¢ There is another way of memorizing,
however <and this is the true and prop
er way), which never fails â to "photo-
Vraph" the music upon one's brain. This
is sometime? difficult at first and re
quires something of a brain to start
.with,' but if children are trained to ;i
.from the beginning it does not trouble
them. '
Let the pupil take one "measure" of a
â¢ piece of music, look ct it carefully, then
shut his eyes or look away, and try to
play what he sees in his mind's eye. At
first he will probably fail to see any
thing at all, but after trying a few
times he will be able to see at least a
few note? and to play them from mem
ory â In oth^r v.-ords, from what he
leads in his mind. As soon as he is able
to play one measure in this way, let
him try the next, and so on, until he is
able to play a whole bar of music by
this method. When the bar of music is

The record is the best evidence of the validity of our
contention that if municipalities insist upon going into
the business of selling water, light or power, or running
street railways, they be prevented at the start from
charging off deficits to the taxpayers. The postal busi
ness of the government is a sufficient warning in this
particular, if a municipality issue -bonds to enter upon
the public ownership of a public utility, let them \rest
upon the plant they create and be paid by those who use
it. In that way only can we hope for an approach to
an honest and business administration of the utilities.
Suppose that the Postmaster General were empowered
to provide for a prospective deficit by adding to the
price of letter stamps, of money orders and of the par
cels post, is it likely that we would have as many defi
cits? The users of the facility 'would feel it at once, and
they would be moved to demand a more careful over
sight of the business. But the deficit is paid indirectly
by taxes, and only the "few who read the annual report
know that a deficit exists, but they pay it just the same.
Carried into municipal administration of a business, the
losses caused by incompetency and dishonesty would
have to be made good by increasing the price of water,
light or power to the rate payer, and of street railway
fares to the passengers. It would hit them directly,
and be felt, instead of being taken out of them indirectly
and practically without their knowledge.
The/people will do well to join the most enlightened
advocates of public utilities in demanding that every
plant carry its own bonds and the cost of its administra
tion.
The report of the Postmaster General every year is an
interesting history of "the incompetence of goverrimenf
in business. Twenty years ago the postal deficitâ was
$20,000,000 annually. Three years ago it ran down to
$3,000,000, and the department had great hopes of mak
ing Doth ends meet, and ventured again to promise that
the business would be made self-supporting. But the last
report shows that the deficit at the close of this fiscal
year will be $7,000,000, and that of the year ending June
30, 1005, will be $8,000,000. As deficits, like the first
statement of liabilities in bankruptcy cases, never grow
less and usually grow larger, it is safe to say that this
$15,000,000 may be trusted to be $20,000,000. It is all the
time plain that there would be no deficit at all if those
who use postal facilities were compelled to pay what
thej* cost. But, as it is a mixture of business and poli
tics, favor is sought with the users of those facilities by
making thorn cheap and the deficit is charged off to the
taxpayers. So we have had letter postage reduced to
two cents, rnd have been promised a one-cent rate, but
the resulting deficit comes out of the taxpayers' pockets.
There ?re those who contend that the control of its
mails by a country i^ necessary to government, and that
its political interests require that it have that power, and
thit. therefore, the system is no more to be expected to
support itself than Congress, or the Department of State
or of Justice. This view was not accepted in the -begin
ning of our government, for then it was the general view
that the^ postal business was a business, and not a proper
political function of government. In the result, in the
constant deficits in their fluctuation to a minimum and
then their stead}' rise to a maximum, we have cumula
tive testimony to the incapacity of government for
business. Why make it self-supporting when losses can
be taken out of the taxpayers?
From the time that Benjamin Franklin was Postmas
ter Genera], under the Confederacy, until now it has
been the dream and the struggle^ of every Postmaster^
General to make the business pay. In annual reports we
have rosy predictions that were never fulfilled. No. mat
ter how greatly the revenues increased the deficits have
appeared with all the regularity of seedtime and harvest,
and ever}' session of Congress finds them the largest
in the annual deficiency appropriation.
It is interesting to observe that as we recede from the
government departments that arc handling property and
doing business,'' and approach those which are engaged
in the legitimate purpose of government, which is gov
erning, a political function entirely, the scars of scandal
grow less frequent and less pronounced. If this be the
case in the Federal government, what can be expected
from municipal government in business? The answer is
found in the revelations in New York and Philadelphia,
in Boston and Chicago.
THOSE who advocate public ownership of public
utilities by municipalities, are in the habit of
pointing with pride to the Federal administration
of the postofiice'of the business of receiving and send
ing mail to its destination, and the transaction of a bank
ing business in the sale of money orders. As we have
already pointed out, the greatest public scandals we have
had have occurred, and under all parties, in the Post
office Department. The next greatest have been in the
Interior Department, and both are handling property,
buying and selling J in business.

Once out of sight of his companions

analysis will grow as the years ad
vance.
Listening to music becomes intense
ly interesting to children when pre
sented in this manner, and the way in
which they .sometimes grasp the idea
of the composer is truly astonishing.
Tell him that the composer had a
certain picture, or rather, a certain
scene in his mind when he wrote the
music and that he (the boy) must try
to find out what it was. Tell him that
the music will describe it to him and
he must listen well to what the music
is saying so that he may find what it
is all about.
The training that he gets in this way
will be of priceless value to him in later
years, too, for by practice the "photo
graphic" method of memorizing be
comes second nature to the musician
and requires even less effort than the
method of "playing by ear."
The two methods do not conflict at
all, by the way, although some people
contend that they do. I have used both
methods all my life, playing by ear be
cause I "was born that way" and could
not help it, and memorizing by way of
the "mental picture" also.
In connection with the subject of
memorizing; there is another point
which I wish to bring up and that is
the way In which a child should be
taught to listen to music.
The technical fide of this we dis
cussed in one of the earlier lessons,
where I urged parents to take their
children to hear good music, but in ad
dition to the technical the imaginative
side of the music should be made to
mean something to the child, and his
fancy should be taught to paint pic
tures descriptive of every piece of
music he hears.
young pupils to work up a little reper
toire as soon as they begin to have
pieces at all. They should be taught
to memorize everything, and as they
progress from one' piece to another the
old ones should be reviewed Ih order,
at least once every day, that they may
not be forgotten. By doing this a child
may acquire a very delightful- little
repertoire, and so be able to play at a
moment's notice any number of pretty
pieces and studies correctly "and music
ally. The more accustomed the child
becomes to doing this sort of thing the
better he will do it, and as he gains
confidence he will be able to throw
more and more soul into his rendition
of the music, and will become in truth
a veritable little artist.
'"ordinary drains arc laid under the ground and water is
applied until the alkali in the upper layer of soil has
all been dissolved away. After that the problem is to
irrigate to just such a degree that, while the crops have
plenty of moisture, the lower alkali will never be stirred

lies deep will be disturbed and then the land will be
Spoiled." , Â¦
How shall the* agriculturist find out just how much

Agriculture is trying to find out for the farmer's bene

Egypt is irrigated by turning loose the whole Nile. The
g-r-eater part of Egypt is freshened by methods similar
to those in use in Southern California. Quite a large
amount of land in Arizona may be" reclaimed in the pri
mary work of the Department of Agriculture. It is esti
mated that possibly but one-thirtieth of; Arizona can be
irrigated with the present water supply when fully util
ized, but still that area will be" respectable as measured
by standards supplied by Eastern States.
The Tonto dam, which is being constructed' above
Phoenix, will supply water for about 200,000 acres. The
dam on the Colorado River will irrigate a similar area.
It is safe to allow 100,000 acres more to be irrigated by
small streams in the Gila River drainage system, so that
half a million acres of Arizona lands' that are now
waste may be turned into farms. Incidentally it may be
said that the comparative lack of water in Arizona sup
plies an incentive to the Government to ascertain the
minimum amount that is necessary to sustain certain'
crops.

James Kelley, the negro who claims
to have been born in Ireland, was
given ten days in the County Jail
yesterday by Judge Mogan. He said
he was a native' of Limerick, and
Bailiff Jerome J. Hickey, who carried
a pike there in 1798 during the rebel
lion, asked Kelley how he came to be
so black. "When I lived .there I didn't
have my uniform on," said Hickey,
"but I never got so sunburned as you."
"Well." said Kelley, "climate changes.
It's lots hotter there now than when
you were in Limerick." Bailiff Mahoney
suggested that the light sentence was
due to the fact that Judge Mogan once
lived in Ireland. "Like Kelley did," said
Bailiff Hickey. as he moved off with
his prisoner.
"Did the complaining witness offer
you any money to hit him in the eye
after he had called you across the
street?" asked Prosecutor Weller. The
defendant admitted there was no mone
tary remuneration attached to the deed.
The arresting: officer testified to Dough
erty's generally worthless character,
and the defendant was convicted on
both charges. To-day Judge Conlan
will give him two six-spots in the
County Jail, one on each charge.
Dougherty told Judge Conlan that the
lodging-house keeper eyed him in a dis
respectful manner while in the saloon,
and for this he punched him a couple
of times, merely for percentage. Then
he claimed the lodging-house keeper
beckoned to him from across the street,
and he went over and did the optical
work.
James Doupherfy, like thf prodigal
son, '"haf; enm? to his own asrain." Threo
weeks ago ho was bpfnre Judgo Mogan
on the Charge of burglary and was dis
missed. He said he was a sailor in the
navy and was drunk when he com
mitted the crime. The value of the
property taken was slight and his plea
won mercy. At the time Judge Mogan
told him that if he were a criminal he
would come before the bar of justice
again, and if he were not the arrest
would be a lesson to him.
Yesterday he appeared before Judge
Cortlan on a charge of battery and one
of vagrancy. In a saloon Monday after
noon he encountered the proprietor of.
the lodging-house he was accused of
robbing and handed him a few hot ones
right off the stove. Then he followed
the retreating man across the street
and did up one of his eyes in opal, um
ber" and dun colors, so that it looked
like the tintings of twilight on the
desert.

In a suit filed Yesterday by Emma,
Cora, Arthur H. and Gladys Evans
against the directors of. the Pacific
Transfer Company, in which they are
stockholders, they charge the defend
ant with entering into a conspiracy
to force them f .out of the. concern and
to turn the business of the company
over to the Overland Freight Transfer
Company.
In support of their charge they cite
the, fact that three of the directorsâ
E. Li. Tilden, Dupont Coleman and W.
II. Fuller â assessed the stock held by
the Evans family and have ordered It
sold because they failed to pay it.
The Evanses ask for an injunction pre
venting the sale and for judgment de
claring the resolution levying the
assessment void and also for an in
junction preventing the defendants
from entering into any contract with
the Overland people.

1 At the hearing there were numerous
witnesses to prove that the sleeper wag
' merely slapped with a duck in the
| bands of HagVrty by way of a joke
land even the complaining witness ad
i rnitted that he had not seen the gun
. in action.
James J. Hagerty, who keeps a saloon
on Howard street, went out triumph
antly from Judge Fritz's court yester
day after undergoing a hearing on the
charge of assaulting James S. Bean
with a deadly weapon.
Hagerty testified that he came homa
from a duck hunting trip Sunday with
a bulging game bag and found Bean
taking a siesta in a chair in the bar
room. He drew forth one of the punc
tured ducks and swatted the lodger
across the face with it. Bean awoke
from his deep dream of peace to find
Hagerty standing over him with a shot
gun in one hand and a slaughtered duck
in the other. He reasoned quickly that
ho had been hit with the gufi and
nearly tore down the front of the
saloon in making his escape from
further violence.
Talking about combinations, Judge
Fritz judicially reviewed one yester
day that should pay the limit. 'Alfred
R. E. Morse, a negro, who had lost his
rabbit's foot, was arrested for cruelty
to animals. He was unnecessarily
whipping a white horse attached to
Undertaker Godeau's dead wagon in an
endeavor to nurry a corpse to a waiting
slab. A woman with red hair had him
arrested for cruelty to animals and he
was fined $10.
All Chinamen in a court of justice
when they are sworn hold up their left
hand. Quong Yin went the limit in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday, when
ho, appeared on thÂ«Â» charge of having
lottery tickets in his possession. He
foum^a seat in the jury box and when
the arresting officer was sworn the
Chinaman's left hand went high in the
air. The Judge motioned to him to
lower it, -but he paid no heed. Bailiff
Hickey went over and told the "Chink"
to put his hands in his pocket, but the
uplifted member was stanch. 'By force
the bailiff pressed the arm down to the
defendant's side, but he had no sooner
moved away than it shot into the air
again. All during the hearing the
Chinaman maintained the same atti
tude and never lowered his arm. until
the case had been dismissed and he
found himself out in the corridor.
Edward Miller, the bellboy wlio was
arrested at San Jose for stealing jeV
els belonging to Mrs. Mary C. Hang at
the. Roycroft Hotel in this city, and
who told the Santa Clara officers that
he was clerk of Judge Mogan's court,
was before tho same outraged Magis
trate yesterday whose name he had
bandied about so freely. The Judge
had read ' about the Fiddler "ringer"
occurrence and he didn't want any
scandal connected with the track over
which ho presides, so*_he made Clerk
Pat Gray range himself alongside the
defendant, for* comparison.
There was no possibility of a two
dromio business in connection with the
men. Miller lacks the drooping lower
lip and thÂ« keen, shifty eyes that De
tective Hogan found in Soeder, and be
sides he is decidedly better 'looking
than Clerk Gray. Tho clerk was ac
quitted of complicity and Miller was in
structed and arraigned on the charge
of grand larceny. His alleged partner
in crime, Archie Harris, is still being
sought for by the police.
Two brothers. George and Albert
Davis, both still under the age of 30
years, were before Judge Mogan yes
terday on a charge of vagrancy. They
were the very limit of miserable co
caine fiends. For the last six weeks
they have inhabited a filthy room with
their mother at 1126 Howard street, liv
ing on scraps gathered from the chari
table poor in the neighborhood. The
mother is also a cocaine fiend and her
condition was so pitiable that she was
sent to the City and County Hospital
at the time of thai arrest Monday night.
The cases of the' two unfortunate men
were continued for one week to see if
abstinence from the drug will work
any benefit for them.
John McDuff, who is shy one ear, and
Thomas Gorman, a major portion of
whose nose has gone the way of all
flesh, were before Judge Cabaniss yes
terday because they were fighting on
Fourth street at the same time that a
policeman was passing along. The
Judge looked over them critically and
finally dismissed them. "Both of you
gentlemen appear to have probed this
fighting game to the bottom," he said,
"and should realize its dangers. De
part in peace and remain peaceable or
something will happen next time."
Interlocutory decrees or divorce were
granted yesterday to Florence Mathe
s?on from Alexander Ma meson for de
>trJion, Clarence E. Sayles from Mary
A. Sayles for intemperance, Lillian
Smith from John Smith for neglec*.
Lida Smith from O. Ray Smith for de
sf-rtion, Emma Wedemeyer from B. H.
Wedemeyer for desertion and John Sul
livan from Lulu Sullivan for desertion.
Beatrice Kearney filed a suit for di
vorce* for desertion against D. L. Kear
ney.
â¢ JLnex E. Hay Harrison filed an atTi -
davit yesterday in support of a motion
jot -alimony to be made Friday in which
the avers that she is in need of money
afcd will ask the court to compel Mah-
Jon C. Harrison, who is being sued for
divorce by b,er, to pay her $100 a month
additional alimony, J730 for counsel
fees and $200 costs of suit.
Sojjhle and Joseph McFall, respect
ively plaintiff and defendant in an ac
tion "for divorce, were in Judge Sea
wc-lTs court yesterday almost an entire
d;*y.j Each one tried to show that the
â¢nher is responsible for their matrimon
ial mfelicities. Such a mass <if evi
dence was introduced by both sides
that Judge Seawell put the matter over
until* next Friday, when McFall will
try to show that Instead of his being' a
cÂ« pel. husband, as his wife charges, he
Mias # -been a much abused one. He will
*Aty> try to prove that his wife is guiky

Yesterday the band drew new heavy
uniforms and to-day and to-morrow
the whole regiment expects to be fitted
out with new apparel suited to this
climate.
Tht Twenty-eighth Infantry,- which
arrived home from the Philippines, on
the 14th inst., is still burdened with
heavy army overcoats, necessitated by
the rigors of this climate compared
with that it has just left.
Next Monday morning the cavalry
will go through a number of new ma
neuvers* and will wind up by attacking
the light battery out on the hills near
the r>oÂ»nt.
Now General MacArthur has decided
to establish a practical school for mili
tary training, and in a few days^orders
will be issued to this effect. This school
is really to be a sort of campaign drill
in .which both the Tenth and Twenty
eighth infantries are to^ take part.
These drills are to take place every
afternoon except Saturday and. Sunday.
They will sometimes be held on the
golf links and occasionally at the point.
They will certainly be of a spectacular
nature, and will give the troops a
chance they have never had before.
Orders have also gone forth for
mounted guard drills. This morning at
9 o'clock the squadron of the Ninth
Cavalry, Major John Bigelow Jr., will
go through the regular drill, and at its
conclusion the pitching of the Sibley
tents will take place.
The Tenth Infantry, Colonel Charles
H. Nobk', has been doing fine work all
along, and now is in first-class shape
to go .into the field at a moment's no
tice. The Twenty-eighth Infantry,
Colonel O. J. Sweet, which has been
away for 4 the last two' years in the
rough part of the Philippines, is show
i:., up in good style in its daily drills.
At the present time a morning at the
Presidio is both instructive and inter
esting, and shows what Uncle Sam's
men can do when they are put on their
mettle, and are under orders to be pre
pared for any and every emergency.
Troops at ! the Presidio were very
busy yesterday. The' Ninth Cavalry is
showing up in splendid shape since
Major Bigelovir has been putting them
through, complete and exhaustive
drills.

General MacArthur Has Decided
to Establish a Practical
School for Military Training
At the hearing yesterday the Judge
insisted on the special prosecutor stat
ing the reason why the charge should
he dismissed, in order that any sus
picion of compounding a felony should
bo done away with. It appeared that
no demand had been made on the de
fendant, because he could not be founJ
in person and consequently there' was
nc ground for the charge of embezzle
nfent. Mrs. Lyons said Â£he was entirely
satisfied with the release of the mort
gage and Haars was set at liberty.
Numerous attempts were made by
Haars and his friends to induce Judge
Mogan to dismiss the felony charge
against the real estate dealer, but he
steadfastly refused until documents
were produced in court showing* that
the mortgage had been satisfied. At
.the last hearing of the^case he gave
the defendant two days to exhibit the
satisfaction of the mortgage and prom
ised that if it was not forthcoming it
that time he would proceed with the
hearing, regardless Â«>f any further set
tlement.
Judge Mogan yesterday dismissed the
charge qf felony embezzlement against
Charles J. Haars, president of the Don
ald Investment Company, with offices
at SoO Market street. The case has been
hanging fire fur a number of weeks
and the dismissal made on mo
tion of the special prosecuting attorney
after a thorough showing had been
made that the claim of the prosecuting
witness had been settled satisfactorily.
Haars was arrested on the charge of
embezzling $700, part of $950 intrusted
tn him as a real estate dealer by Mrs.
Antonie Lyons for the purchase of a
lodging-house at 32 Second street. Mis.
Lyons secured possession of the house
last July and in the month of Decem
ber of last year was called upon to pay
a morteage of $?oo. of which she had
no knowledge, believing that the fur
niture was entirely free from encumb
rance when she took it into her pos
session.
Both women were in court and
pleaded with tears and words that the
brutal son and brother should only get
a reprimand. Judge Cabaniss gave him
one that made his hair curl and warned
him that if ever again he was com
plained of he would be given the full
limit of the law.
enough money from them to furnish
him with ammunition for a drank. His
latest escapade was Monday night,
when he knocked his mother down and
tore nearly all the clothing from his
sister's body. Then he went to a neigh
boring corner and boasted of his deed.
He was arrested for being drunk in a
public place, but neither his mother nor
his sister would consent to a prosecu
tion.

afternoon John Sllva, a miner, was

Ex-Congressman Julius Kahn has
received a letter from Hon. C. H.
Keep, Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury, stating that goods may be
withdrawn from bonded warehouses
without 'the payment of duty for ship
ment to Guam. This reverses the
ruling of the Treasury Department
made November 20, 1901, prohibiting
shipments out of bond to Guam, Tu
tuila and the Philippines on the
ground that the islands are under the
jurisdiction of the United States and
that exports from bond could only be
made to foreign countries.
On March 8, 1902, Congress passed
the Philippine act, which extended
the privilege of exporting goods from
bond to the Philippines. Now the
Treasury Department has extended
the privilege to Guam and will doubt
less, if application is made therefor,
extend the same privilege to Tutuila.
This privilege does not, however,
embrace the shipment of goods for
drawback, nor with remission of in
ternal revenue tax. It applies only to
imported foreign merchandise in
bonded warehouse. ; >

Warrants Out fop Arrest of Two Men
for Grand larceny by Trick
and Dericc.
Metzger & Franklin, the lottery
firm, has instituted criminal proceed
ings against E. F. Holmes and H.
Schubach, the two men who succeeded
in securing aN check from them last
Friday for $7500 on an alleged bogus
coupon. Holmes, who came from St.
Louis, engineered the scheme, and it is
said Schubach, whom he met on the
train, was used by Holmes to assist
him without Schubach being aware of
the fact that everything was not In
order.
Yesterday M. C. O'Connor. 42 Sec
ond street, an employe of Metzser &
Franklin, swore to complaints before
Police Judge Conlan charging Holmes
and Schubach with the crime of grand
larceny by trick and device. Holmes
did not leave the city and defied the
lottery man and police when a de
mand wa3 made upon him to refund
his share of the money, part being: in
coin and part in a draft on New York.
Schubach went to Los Angeles, but
upon learning that there was a dispute
about the transaction returned here
voluntarily, arriving yesterday. After
consuiting with his attorney, S. M.
Shortridge, Schubach surrendered to
the police and was immediately re
leased on ball. Schubach says he is
innocent of any wrong, and the facts
indicate that, too.
Schubach was arrested last night by-
Patrolman Fontana on Market street
on a charge of grand larceny and sub
sequently released on a $10,000 bond,
furnished by an indemnity company.

OAKLAND, Jan. 26. â The contest
between Jack Cordell and Charlie
Seiger, which has been postponed
twice, will take place to-morrow night
at the Reliance Club gymnasium. The
men will meet at 135 pounds and will
box fifteen rounds.
The reason of the last postpone
ment was the inability of Seiger to
make the weight in time. When it
was found he could not possibly get
down to 133 pounds Cordell offered
to give away two pounds, but even
this was too much for Seiger, so the
contest had to be postponed. Seiger
is at the required weight.

LOTTERY MEN INSTITUTE
CRI3UXAL PROCEEDINGS
It is expected that further develoo
ment.of the sport will result In benefit
to this State, as some of the best ponies
have been bred here and the supply at
present falls far short of the demand.
In discussing the advantages which
this State will derive from the develop
ment of polo Secretary T. A. Driscoll
said yesterday:
"If our plans carry a large number
of wealthy people will be attracted to
California each winter, many of whom
may become permanent residents, and
all of whom will be liberal money
spenders. They are sure to become ad
vocates of the superior climatic ad
vantages of California. Wherever they
go they will sing its praises and they
will be persons whose opinion counts
for something. It can readily be seen
that all this will be of tremendous ad
vantage to the State in the way of ad
vertising its attractions."
The first big meet of the new asso
ciation will be held at Del Monte from
February 18 to 22, there being polo and
pony racing on alternate days. The
scene will then be shifted to Bur
lingame, where sports will be promoted
from February 27 to 29. The Inter
national polo tournament will be com
menced at Burlingame on March 12.
If the Golden Gate Park Commis
sioners find it within their power to
provide a suitable field for the poloists
the game will be played in this city
once a week. The clever horsemen of
the Burlingame Country Club are play-
Ing a brilliant game th:s season and
whenever they appear the contest will
be worth witnessing.
The Â»offlcers of the California Polo
and Pony Association are: Charles W.
Clark, president: Francis J. Carolaa,
first vice president; Rudolph Spreckels,
second vice president; Thomas A. Dris
coll, secretary; R. M. Tobin, treasurer.
The directory consists, in addition to
the foregoing, of E. W. Boseke, Charles
E. Maud, John L.. Colby. Robert L.
Bettner, L.. H. Dudley and Joseph S.
Tobin.
The officers of the California Polo
and Pony Racing Association have am
bitious plans, which, if they are car
ried out, will make this coast the home
of winter polo and of pony racing. They
are urged on by the remarkable interest
shown in polo this year as evidenced
by the number of European players
who have made a pilgrimage to this
coast and by the large number of spec
tators which have witnessed the games
each week at Burlingame.
Hanlon is attending strictly to busi
ness at Alameda and expects to be
able to go at any pace Broad may set,
whether it is boxing or slugging.
There has been no betting on the
fight up to the present time, but from
the inquiries being made it is thought
Hanlon will open an 8 to 10 choice.
There is not the same magic in the
name of Broad that there is in that of
Champion Young Corbett, so the man
from New Orleans will be on the Ions
end apparently throughout all the bet
ting.
A number of sporting men are going
out to Broad's quarters at the beach
to-day to Bee him in action. He prom
ises to take on any apptring boxers who
may appear.
"You watch me drop him."
Kid Broad, who seems to â¢ be the
humorist of the prizering-, although hla
face i3 marked with tragedy, spent a
busy day yesterday. He is preparing
for hig bout with Eddie Hanlon on Fri
day night at Sheeh'an's Beach Tavern.
He went a long journey on the road
yesterday morning, boxed with Cyclone
Kelly In the afternoon and was at work
in the gymnasium again last night.
He is paying particular attention to
his breathing apparatus, as his muscles
of iron need but little tuning up.
The lure has been held out to him
that if he beats Hanlon he can have
a match with Corbett next month.
When he was told this he said:

SUMMARY.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26.â Long shots
had another inning at Ascot Park to
day and but one favorite got first
money. Autumn Time started the ball
rolling: by taking the first race at. 10
to 1 from Jingler, Mainspring being
third. There were fourteen horses in
the race and the start was bad. Dr.
Bernays, the redhot favorite, failed to
get to the front at any 6tage.
Brown Study won the two-year-old
flash frcm Azelina, the favorite, with
Bishop Poole third. Brown Study cov
ered the three furlongs In 36'4 seconds,
lowering the track record by a quarter
of a second.
The one and an eighth miles hurdle
race furnished a surprise. May S win
ning at odds of 40 to 1. Phil Archibald
was second and Heir Apparent third.
Cambaceres was favorite, but was not
prominent in the running.
The fourth went to Effervescence at
4 to 1, Eugenie B, the favorite, wan
second and Laureatea third.
The fifth looked like an open race and
Ultruda was made favorite. El Orlente,
Glenrice and Blueridge were heavily
played. The winner turned up in Moor
at 10 to 1, Ultruda second and Martin
Brady third. Weather fine; track good.
SALEM. Or., Jan. 26.â A dispute as to
the right to possess the famous pacing
stallion Diablo, valued at $5000. cul
minated to-day in the arrest of C. D.
Crookham, a prominent horseman of
San Francisco, on a charge of larceny.
Diablo was owned by "William Mur
ray, a horseman of Redlands, Cal., who
died recently. Before his death he
leased the stallion to Samuel Castro, a
stockman well known in Oregon. Upon
his death title to the animal passed to
his widow. She has refused to recognize
the lease, and following a lengthy cor
respondence Crookham came to Salem
to-day and demanded possession of the
horse upon an order signed by Mrs.
Murray. Upon being refused he went
to the fair grounds, broke open Dlablo"a
stable and took away the horse. The
arrest followed before the animal could
be shipped away, and Crookham was
released on his own recognizance until
to-morrow morning, when he will be
tried before Justice Horgan. Attorneys
have been employed on both sides and
a warm contest is expected. The whole
question apparently hinges upon the
right of Castro to hold the horse under
his lease.

Riesca, a starter in the fifth event,
was one of the hottest tips of the
meeting, being played from 40 down to
4 and 5. The mare was also heavily
played in the Chicago poolrooms. She
does not call for much.
ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
Atwood, winner of the second race,
was bid up from $500 to $1200 and re
tained by the stable.
Hildebrand piloted two winners.
Dell Fountain's Targette once more
finished second. The fllly was an 8
to 5 chance for the fifth number and
finished second to Moalta. a 10 to 1 shot,
with Jack Martin up. Forest Fire, at
60 to 1, ran into the show, and if away
better could possibly have won.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Milt Jones' Rollick, favorite for the
Futurity course sprint, was never
prominent and ran unplaced. Ulctma,
a 5 to 1 chance, with Larsen up,
breezed along out in the lead, but
"dogged" it when nabbed by Nullah
and was downed nearly a length.
Brennus ran a close third.
There Mas some semblance to class
among the starters in the mile and a
sixteenth purse run, and it furnished
the prettiest contest of the afternoon.
The race had a most open look, and
when Stuyve finally closed favorite
there was plenty of 18 to 5. Ben Mac-
Dhui, the opening choice, receded from
2 to 5. Tommy Burns, with Jockey
Club, made a bold bid for it, the geld
ing leading to the paddock almost be
fore flashing distress signals. There
he was passed by both Mendon and
Soothsayer, the former getting a head
decision. The winner closed at odds
of 4*6 to 1.
XULIiAII BEATS ULCTMA.
If a bookmaker could not win yes
terday he should try farming or some
other vocation. After the win of My
Surprise in the first event the five fol
lowing favorites all took the count.
My Surprise started for the first
time in the colors of his new owner,
J. X. Mounee, and made good first
rattle out of the box. Hildebrand had
the leg: up and the gelding closed equal
favorite with Puss in Boots. Creed
more led for a quarter, when My Sur
prise took the lead, and, in a hard
drive, beat Flyer a neck on the wire.
Puss in Boots was kept busy beating
DV. Sherman, a 60 to 1 shot, for the
show.
. Possibly Atwood was best of the six
starters in the seven-furlong selling
recital for three-year-olds. That is a
matter of conjecture: At any rate,
Jimmy Jones, who rode the colt, was
allowed to cut out his own pace and
he was ridden out in 1:26%. Behind
followed The Cure, the 7 to 5 favorite,
astride which Larsenirode a ridiculous
race. Instead of crowding on sail and
making up his ground gradually, he
waited until the head of the stretch
was reached before it struck him At
wood might win, and then he grew
busy. Instructor finished third and
Ethel Abbott fourth.
FIVE FAVORITES IX)SE.
Sadness and gloom were depicted
on the features of every Oregon and
Â¦Washington sport after the last race
yesterday at Oakland. Sad Sam, the
"idol of the bushes," a 13 to 20 favor
ite, was beaten by Jane Holly.
If Joe Yeager knew the anguish the
victory of his mare caused he would
probably cause his name to be en
rolled as a member of the vast army
of- sympathizers. When bettlngr on
Sad Sam the speculator has a slight
"shade" to begin with. This is worm
wood and gall to a northwestern
sport â maybe.
As usual Sad Sam beat his field
away and it looked all over, for E.
M. Brattain could not get within hail-
Ing distance of him. In the stretch,
though, Ilildebrand caught him with
Jane Holly, and if the Emeryville
poundmaster had been present he
could have snapped up a dog without
a license. When Sam began to snarl
and growl Joe Yeager's mare skim
med by him, winning in the fast time
of 1:12 Vi for the six furlongs. Mo
corito was third.

riOXEER RESIDENT CALLED.
Senator Thomas Flint says the people
of California are in favor, of the nomi
nation of Theodore Roosevelt and that
the delegation from this State should
be pledged hard and fast for Roosevelt.
At the Union League Club last night
Senator Flint said: "I do not pretend
to keep in touch with politics in San
Francisco, but*I know the sentiment of
the people in the country. The people
believe that Roosevelt is straight and
square; that he has fought the trusts
and ought to .be nominated. This
State is normally Republican by 20,000
majority. We would probably give
Roosevelt 30,000 against any man the
Democrats could nominate. I expect
to go to the State convention. from San
Benito. County. All Â» the Republicans
that I have met are in favor of pledg
ing our State delegation to stand by
Roosevelt."
The Roosevelt .Republican Club,
Charles Alpers president, met at 405
Montgomery street recently and recom
mended the nomination of United
States Senator George C. Perkins for
Vice President of the United States.
A conference of the State League of
Iroquols Clubs wjll be held at Pythian
Castle In this city Monday, February
22. All Democratic clubs are invited to
send delegates. 'o^-;^V:;
For delegates at large mention is
made of James C. Needham, U. S.
Grant. John D. Spreckels, George A.
Knight, Governor George C. Pardee,
Frank H. Short, M. H. de Young, E.
B. Edson, John F. Davis and Alden
Anderson.
California will be represented in the
Republican National Convention by
twenty delegates, or four at large and
two from each Congressional district.
Harold Power of Placer, Editor Milnes
of Humboldt and C. E. Clinch of Grass
Valley are mentioned as probable can
didates in the First District. Judge A.
G. Burnett of Sonoma and Joseph
Steffans of Sacramento are spoken of
In the Second. J. J. Luchsinger of
Vallejo may be selected as one of the
delegates to represent the Third Dis
trict.
CALIFORNIA DELEGATION.
IX THE FILTH DISTRICT.
State Senator E. I. Wolfe stated yes
terday that he was not a candidate for
the Congressional nomination in the
Fifth District. The Senator remarked:
"I am not in the race for Congress,
but I expect to be a candidate for re
election to the State Senate."
The politicians would not be sur
prised if some aspirant from Santa
Clara County should be selected to
carry the Republican standard of this
district in the coming campaign. The
alignment in the Fifth is not so clearly
foreshadowed as in the Second. There
is a common impression that William
J. Wynn will not be able to bring about
a fusion of Democrats and Union La
bor men. It is predicted that Union
Labor indorsements of Democratic nom
inees will be few and far between, and
that Democratic Indorsements of Union
Labor candidates will not be equiva
lent to delivery of the goods. _
There is considerable comment in the
political camps touching the probable
selection of delegates at large and dis
trict delegates to the Republican Na
tional Convention. William M. Cutter
of Yuba, chairman of the Republican
State Committee, will probably send
out notices for the committee to meet
some time In March to issue the call
for the State convention. The chair
man asserts that the call for election of
delegates will be made to. conform to
section 1373 of the Political Code,
which provides that a primary election
shall be held on the first Tuesday of
the month of May, 1904, and every four
years thereafter for the purpose of
choosing delegates to State and district
conventions to select delegates to a na
tional convention.
Word comes from Sacramento that
Senator Robert T. Devlin, who has been
mentioned as an aspirant for the Re
publican Congressional nomination in
the Second District, is not a candidate
and will not permit his name to go be
fore the convention.
Democratic newspapers in the Second
Congressional District assert that Theo
dore A. Bell will be re-elected to Con
gress. The Willows Journal fancies
that The Call can do more toward de
feating a Democrat in San Francisco
than in the Second District. The ap
proaching contest In the Second Is,
however, engaging the attention of pol
iticians in both parties. The Repub
lican papers*of the district are quite
confident of victory in the coming fight.
Duncan E. McKinlay is spoken of as
a popular campaigner who would carry
the district against the strongest man
the Democrats could nominate. Mr.
McKinlay is not actively striving for
the Republican nomination, but if the
convention should place him in the field
as the leader of the Republican forces
he would make the battle of his life
to win out. Speaking on this topic yes
terday, Mr. McKinlay remarked:
"I am not seeking the nomination for
Congress, but I am sure I could, as the
Republican nominee, carry the district
against Theodore Bell or any \ other
Democrat. I have campaigned in the
counties of the Second District in every
election since 1890. I know every coun
ty. I worked for years at my trade in
Sacramento, and the workingmen of
that city know me. I was Invited by
the Labor Council last year to deliver
the address in Sacramento and accept
ed the invitation. In every campaign
since 1890 I have addressed big meet
ings in the Democratic strongholds of
Colusa, Yolcr and Glenn counties. If
I get the Republican nomination I will
signify readiness to meet Mr. Bell on
the rostrum in joint discussion. I know
that he is a good talker and a clever
campaigner, but I am willing to meet
him on the stump."
BERLIN, Jan. 26.â The news of the
torturing to death of Germans In
Southwest Africa, received here to-day
through British press dispatches,
caused the most painful impression
among the public. The Colonial. Office
was v.'ithout confirmation of the report,
but the statements made are not dis
credited.
Director Steubel of the Colonial Of
fice asked the Reichstag Budget Com
mittee to-day to defer consideration of
the colonial appropriations, as he was
too busy preparing to send oft troops
to Southwest Africa to explain the es
timates. A total of 2C00 men are al
ready afloat or preparing to embark.
It. is believed, in the light of to-day's
intelligence, that this force is inade
quate to adopt agrgresslve,. crushing
operations over a wide territory, domi
nated by 15,000 insurgent tribesmen.
The German transport officers are
buying oxen for the punitive expedi
tions. The veterans' societies are ask
ing for contributions for those who are
fighting in Southwest Africa.
LONDON, Jan. 26. â A dispatch to the
Central News from Cape Town says
the bushmen, with the rebels iri^Ger
man Southwest Africa, are committing
terrible atrocities. The limbs of the
dead are chopped off and prisoners are
said to have been bnrned alive.

. W. A. Stuart, a well known land
and mining attorney and one time the
County Clerk of this city, Was found
dead in his room at the Commercial
Hotel yesterday morning. He retired
at his usual early hour the previous
evening, apparently in the best of
health. He generally arose at 6 a. m.
and as he failed to put in an appear
ance soon after that hour hia room
was entered and he was found lying
on the floor in his nightshirt, dead.
He apparently had just arisen from
his bed in the morning when he was
seized with a stroke of apoplexy. He
suffered a slight attack of the same
malady about two years ago.
The deceased was born in Newbury
port. Mass., on January 16, 1843. He
came to California in the early sixties.
He served as County Clerk in 1870-71,
since which time he has followed the
practice of law. He was a man of
high intellectual attainments, of quiet
and modest mein and enjoyed the ac
quaintance of a large circle of friends.
He leaves one son, W. E. Stuart, Who
resides at 809 Van Ness avenue. His
wife died several years ago. The
funeral will take place on Friday at
2 o'clock from the Masonic Temple,
under the auspices of Excelsior Lodge
No. 166.
Invitations are out for the wedding
of Miss Mabel Quatman, daughter of
Mrs. Hannah Quatman, and Lieutenant

excellence under the management of
Mrs. Xavfer Rolker. The following
numbers were rendered:
Friday night brings the assembly at
the Palace, and Saturday the nuptials
of Miss Bernie Drown and Samuel Hart
Boardman. And so, too, at a later hour
will Miss Jaqueline Moore become the
bride of John J. Valentine.
To-night the Borel ball takes place

Mr?. Homer S. King will give a ball at
their home on Broadway.
Mrs. Fred Tallant gave a luncheon
yesterday to her niece. Miss Elsie'Tal

that are dear to the debutante's heart.
The following are some of the girls
who went out: Miss Colburn, Miss Ar

Edith Bull and Miss Kathleen Bull.
Among them are a few maidens
who manifest a strong predilection for
our gallant warriors.
The Presidio hop last night was a
smart affairâ the Coleman dance not
withstandingâand a brave showing of
martial heroes and indisputably pretty
maidens made a very attractive func
tijn.
Masses of American Beauty roses
were used on the tables with fine ef
fect, and palms gracefully filled the
niches and corners of the dining-room.

The largest and the most interesting
event of the daylight hours of yester
day was the tea given by Miss Frances
Harris, niece of Mrs. Christian Reis.
The home was decked in holiday garb
with blossoms of eucalyptus, loads of
ferns and trailing blackberry vines.
And Miss Harris, like the clever hostess
that she is, prepared a surprise for her
guests, and she surprised them with the
announcement ofâ her engagement.
"Ernest Albert Stent?' Yes, the same.
"Oh, I told you eo," say the know-it
alls, but the fact remains that they are
more sure of it, now that it has been
proclaimed 1 . The young bride-to-be is
unquestionably a prime favorite in her
set, where her archness and fine person
ality have individualized her as one
among many. The following young
women assisted Miss Harris at her an
nouncement tea:
Last night one of the prettiest balls
of the season was given by Mr. and
Mrs. Barry Coleman in honor of their
daughter. Miss, Lucy Gwin Coleman,
and her confidante. Miss Christine
Pomeroy. One hundred invitations were
sent out, principally to the buoyant
young members of the Gayety Club and
their men friendsâ who, let it be said,
are selected by ballot when a club func
tion is on. Century Hall, always at
tractive with its neutral walls and
pretty appurtenances, was made very
cozy last night by the introduction of
many palms and a wealth of flow
ers. The host and hostess were assisted
in entertaining the merry young folks
by Mr. and Mrs. Carter Pomeroy, Mr.
and Mrs. Horace Hill, Captain and Mrs.
Robert Fletcher, Mrs. William M. Gra
ham and Miss Coleman.
Merrily on goes the cycle of func
tions, with never a thought of cessa
tion. And it would seem that the
ascetic shadow of Lent has forced the
pressure, for only a few weeks more re
main to the smart set, and then â sack
cloth and ashes for six long, weary
weeks. But what a rest that will be!

Captain Georce A. Swanson, the commodore

ried yesterday at S-'!4 OTarrell street to Mrs.
Krmina. B. Montgomery. Â«'autain nnd Mrs.
J3wanson after the ceremony crossed the bay
in the Peterson launch Amy. which was
specially decorated for the trin. From Oak
land they took the train for Monterey, where
the honeymoon will be passed.
Veteran Mariner Marries.
The gasoline launch Amy," first born of the
Henry Peterson fleet ami on* ot the cld?st
boatf= of her kind on the bay. in enjoying a new
lease of life. Frcshlj painted outside, reup
hols-terej v. ithln. ths Amy looks smart as she
ever dlti and n Baw engine now enables her to
hoM hor own with anything in the launch lin<Â»
en tho liay. This nt-w engine has attracted
wldÂ«>spiea1 attention. It is not only something
new. but it w:m built by a young man who has
taught hi*ise!f 'everything he knows about the
machinist a trade. Frank I'rters. the builder,
lmsj operated Rjsoline engines for Petor^on and
thr late <*harlt-s Fair for a number of years.
His me-rhanical genius, however, was so evl
<l<Â»nt that Peterscn provided Him with a lathe
ari'l other necessary pqulpniÂ«"iit and placed him
In charg.? of all his gasoline boats. Peters
made the drawings, the patterns, did the cast
ing and machine work as well as designing the
new engine. His experience running engines
tausht bin the chief faults of mo*t machines,
and in the Amy's new .visine builders and en.
Rinecn have found much valuable suggestion.
Poter? has pdtentPd nothing about the engine.
He built it. he says, just to show that what he
objected to in other engines could be overcome.
The Atiy's engine is something on the order
of those used in automobiles. It is a four
cylinder, four cycle engine. Each cylinder is
separate. The crank shaft is in two sections.
The engine develops :55 horse power and gives
A'-'M revolutions of a .'{4-inch propeller. The en
gine taken out of the Amy weighed (iSOO
pounds. The Peters engine weighs 1900 pounds.
The old flywheel weighed 1S0O pounds, or only
100 pounds less than the nnw engine, tho fly
wheel i'f which w?ighs only 165 pounds. In the
new engine there are no gaskets. It runs
without battery, spark coil or wiring. Each
j>ait can be reached easily and repairs can be
effected withcut taking tho whole er.Sfine to
pieces. "The Amy Is- too' short to be speedy,
but the new engine sends her along at nearly
11 knots an hour.

The Pacific Mail Company's steam
ship Newport, Captain Saunders, ar
rived yesterday from Panama and way
ports more than half a day earlier than
she was expected. The Newport was
on the drydock during her last stay in
port and a clean bottom enabled her to
make the most of the fine weather
with which she was favored through
out the homeward run. As usual Chief
Officer Morton had the vessel as clean
as an oil burner. Awnings, decks and
woodwork showed not a spot of dirt
and the brasswork shone forth in silent
testimony to the amount of elbow
grease expended in. polishing it.
The Newport brought twenty-eight
passengers, 1103 tons of cargo and
treasure valued at 354,794 6S. Three
jackies from the squadron at Panama
came up on the liner to go to the Mare
Island Hospital. Thn passengers in

situation. The market Is quiet and supplies

Chicago was lower. In that market It Is
now largely a question of scattered speculative
buying, again.it accumulating stocks and sell
ing by packers. â¢ . . -
The Chicago wires of Bolton. De Ruyter A
Co. said: "The close was a shade easier; It
was on the whole, however, a very steady
market. Packers were again rather free sell
ers and are predicting larger receipts of hogs,
and our advices from the same source are that
there is a very perceptible decrease In thÂ«
distributive demand. The outside specula
tors own the property. Stock* are accumu
lating. There 13 a strons bull deal on in
Lard, but the cash proposition, particularly
the discount on loose Lard, hardly seems to
us to Justify the present relative high price.
We advise taking profits, at leaet on long pro
visions."

Despite the wanner weather trade in Citrus
fruits continued quiet, with all dealers oper
attng cautiously and most retailers were taking
no more tnan absolutely necessary for Imme
diate .requirements. Large, size* of Navel
Oranges only were wanted, and such stock was
held rather '-firmly, while there was a marked
pressure to sell small and medium sized fruit,
and several dealers were cutting prices, but
to no nvail. The Puget Sound steamer took
out some small shipments, purchased at the
auction on the preceding day. Six car* are an-.
nounced tor to-day's auction.
Conditions and; prices, in- the Apple market
showed no change from the preceding report.
Poor stock is well cleaned up and medium
priced fruit is selling off well. Strictly fancy
stock, such as Newtown Pippins in 3% -tier
boxes, is scarce ami readily commands full
figures. Bananas are abundant and moving
slowly at unchanged rates.

. Although spot stocks of Butter are slender
and the local demand is good, the trade are
regarding the current high prices wtth ap
prehension owing" to the condition of the East
ern markets. They report that stocks of stor
age Butter in the East are very heavy and
thct 23 large concerns alone hold 33.000.COO lbs.
against 25.U00.CUU at thU time last year, an
increase of 50 per cent, and that thos? Eastern
holder: are watching their opportunity to send
large lines of that Butter into tats market.
Any further advance, they say, would cause
Â¦this result, and the consequence would be that
the market would be worse off than it was
before the current rise.
Cheese shows no further change one way or
the other. The market is still choked with
stock and the demand Is very slack.

sooner had the buying from this source ceassd,
however, than the crowd appeared to have

A large part of these offerings were sup
posed to be for account of the Armours. The
pit was void of buyers. â¢ In consequence May
dropped 2*i@2%c In ten minutes of trading,
going down to 8714c before any support was
offered. At this point the leading lone ap
parently decided to check any further decline.
For the remainder of the session it was be
lieved the Armour interest was an active
buyer. The market responded readily to the
demand. The rally was almost as rapid as the
previous decline. Purchases of 3,000,000 bush
els not only caused a recovery of all or the
loss, but May. late in' the day. sold up to
90HC, an advance of 2%c from the low point.

It is said that there are a number of
other teachers having the same status
as Mrs. Reeves, which will render some
of them insecure in their positions.
Preliminary to a conference to be held
on Thursday evening between the
Board of Education and the Richmond
Improvement Club regarding the need
of more school facilities. Directors
Boyle and Walsh, visited - the district
yesterday arid inspected the Sutro,
Park and Jackson schools, which they
found in' fairly good condition consider
ing the accommodations. In the Sunny
side School one room,' ten by fifteen
feet, contained thirty-five pupils, and
the board has. decided to rent a hall in
the vicinity, in which three large -rooms
will be built to better accommodate the
pupils.
Roncovieri yesterday ascertained upon
investigation that Mrs. Reeves was^by
resolution of the Board of flducation,
adopted on January 27, 1897, ''appointed
as a High School substitute, to be paid
only for actual services rendered."
Under the terms of the resolution
Roncovieri holds, that Mrs. Reeve3
could not receive salary when she was
not actually engaged in teaching. Ron
covieri declares that it must have been
assumed by the court that Mrs. Reeves
was a regular teacher in the depart
ment, whereas she was only a substi
tute, to be assigned to duty as occasion
demanded. .
Roncovieri learns that Mrs. Reeves
was assigned to classes in the Girls*
High School and other schools, was
consolidated out on April 26, 1899. and
on October 29, 1902, was reinstated in
her position in accordance with the
Supreme Court decision In her case.
She was again consolidated out last
month and ordered reinstated by Â¦ the
Superior. Court pending the determina
tion of her suit against the. board.
Roncovieri says there is nothing for
Mrs. Reeves to do, and under the reso
lution originally appointing her she can
be placed on the substitute list and
can only be paid for actual services she
may render. Roncovieri says it is the
intention of -the board to assign Mrs.
Reeves to a class as soon as there is a
vacancy, but it will oppose paying her
salary when she is not occupied.
President Roncovieri is of the opinion
because ex-City Attorney Lane did not
fully acquaint himself with the status
of Mrs. Irene. D. Reeves, a teacher, who
was consolidated out of the public
school department and then ordered re
instated by the Supreme Court, that
the teacher named recovered some SSOOO
in back salary to which she was not
legally entitled. Mrs. Reeves has since
been consolidated out of her position
again and has once more brought suit
for reinstatement.

of Education Says Mrs. Reeves

LEARNS. STATUS
OF A TEACHER
' Clasped to the dead woman's breast
with the foregoing letter and: the
photograph was a scrap of paper con
taining the following: . Â¦ :, â¢
.May the power controlling' this universe
control Harry Bennett and force him'. to come
and do -what Is. right. Make me his;wif# and
be sincere and true to me as I am to him.
Mrs. F. A. Pitman, formerly of
Portland, Or., forsaken by the man she
loved, evidently not wisely but too
well, ended her life in a lodging-house
at 2C8 Turk street Monday night. Her
body was found lying on the bed
dressed. Clasped to her bosom
were a photograph of Harry Vernon
Bennett, whose parents reside at 628
Sutter street; a farewell letter from
him and an unsigned note reproving
him for having jilted her after secur
ing her money.
Mrs. Pitman arrived in this city
last month and took a room at the
Lake House, 268 Turk street. Shortly
after her arrival she engaged the ser
vices of Attorney Edward; T. Maples
and requested him to prosecute Ben
nett. According to the story she told
Maples, Mrs. Pitman first met Ben
nett when she" was running a lodging
house in Portland. _,
He induced her to sell, the -house,
she claimed, and they traveled to Los
Angeles together. Bennett, it is said,
secured $200 of the $500 she had real
ized on the. sale of her lodging-house
and promised to meet her in this city
and make her his wife. He never kept
his promise, and the woman, becom
ing despondent/finally ended her life.
Prior to taking her plunge into eter
nity s*ie used every effort to â¢ induce
Bennett to return to her. In- one of
the letters addressed to him she stated
that she had recently come into a large
fortune, but this, her attorney says,
was merely .an artifice to induce Ben
nett to return to this, city' that she
might prosecute him. on a charge of
obtaining money liy false pretenses or
else induce him to 'marry her.
According to Mrs; Pitman's story,
soon after her, return from Los An
geles she learned of Bennett's dupli
city. She discovered his relations with
a young woman â¢ of. Stockton,
who, it is claimed, came to; this
city within the last few days j seeking
much needed / sympathy from Â¦ the
missing man. As * truth ; dawned on
Mrs. Pitman she grew, despondent and
several threats to make away with her
self culminated Monday afternoon,
â¢ when the man whom she. so deeply
loved sent her the photograph of him
self and another woman. .- .,
Mrs. Pitman was : the widow of a
well known Portland dentist, t who left
her comfortably situated. She has
many friends, in [ that city and", not a
few of them warned her against,Ben
nett. Bennett's recent employment in
this city was with the telephone'com
pany and prior to that, for a time, he
was engaged as a solicitor f^>r the
Attorneys'.. Auxiliary, in the Parrott
building. He is known to have also
served as a private detective and on
the occasion of his visit to Portland
he was engaged in the advertising
business.
BEN'XETTS LAST LETTER.
Bennett's last letter to Mrs. Pitman,
in which he inclosed a photograph of
himself and a woman, was on
lhe office paper of a Chicago wine
house and reads as follows:
My Dear Franclne â From the letter I re
ceived from you to-day I take It for grante-l
that you wish that we should part forever.
Although - It will pain me awfully. I will do
as you say. â¢ â¢ â¢ Any money I have used
of youra I will return as 6Oon as .; I am - on
my feet and able to Bend It. I am pleased to
note your good fortune In coming Into that
amount of money. . Send me my mall; but as
it is your wlÂ«n. .this will be your last letter
from me. .Yours, 1 . > '. . . -HARRY. .
Bennett's mother called at the Cor
oner's office yesterday -and said that
there must be some mistake, as her
"little boy could never be mixed up in
an affair with a woman that had been
married!'! V
The dead '.woman was a widow and
apparently about 34 years of age. The
age of the "little boy" is. variously
stated as from- 20 to 22. He was for
merly in. the employ of the telephone
company.
That Mrs. Pitman was not in finan
cial straits at 'the time of her death
is shown by the fact that among her
effects was found a check for $200 on
the First National Bank of The Dalles,-
Or. Her attorney stated that a firm
doing a general merchandise business
at Dufur, near The. Dalles, owed her
money and, the check was probably
from that firm.'/- -
Late yesterday ' afternoon an -order
was received from Johnston Brosi of
Dufur instructing the Coroner to ship
the- body to that place. The autopsy
showed that death was caused by
asphyxiation.
MOTHER DEFENDS SON.

On a table the following unsigned
letter was found.
SAN FRANCISCO, January.
Dear Harry: I will drop Just a Hne or
two to let you know that I am still living.
Just think what the cold glitter of gold will
do. The day you left me in Log Angeles I
thought that If you did not return life would
.not be worth living. Well, Harry. I suppose
you will wonder how I got your address. You
Â¦wronged me, you know, and may you never
have cause to suffer. You have had your re
venge. O heaven, may you never have cause

DESPONDENT WIDOW WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE HER
SWEETHEART PROVED FICKLE, THE MAN IK THE CASE AND
YOUNG WOMAN WHOM HE MET IN THE EAST.
The objective point of "Woodward's
inspection was Felton street, where he
found a fence extending along the cen
ter of the street between Yale and
Cambridge, thus obstructing the entire
northerly half of the street. On Felton
street, between Cambridge and Oxford,
the southerly half of the street was
fenced In.
Within the inclosures the tenants,
who are mostly vegetable and flower
growers, have planted seeds, so that
the gardens are flourishing on land be
longing to the city which has been
dedicated to use as open public streets.
Other streets, including Silliman street,
are being similarly utilized, though the
necessity for their opening is not as
imperative as Felton street, over which
there Is a considerable traffic. The
board Intends, however, to continue the
work of removing all fences that ob
struct the streets in that vicinity.
To-day the board will consider a com
plaint filed by the Pavers' Union
against the bad condition of the pave
ments on various streets contiguous
to the tracks of the street car lines.
The complainants allege that in most
cases the pavement -has been torn up
and not relaid and is a menace to life
and limb.
Specific attention Is directed to the
crossings at Fillmore and Ellis streets,
O'Farrell and Fillmore, Sacramento and
East, Second and Brannan, Ninth and
Mission, on Mission from Sixteenth to
Twenty-eighth, on Valencia from
Twentieth to Twenty-third and on
Tenth from Howard to Market.
The Board of Works yesterday ap
pointed Frank M. Spiller, Thomas Cut
len and Thomas Linton to be painters.
The men v. ere taken from the civil ser
vice eligible list. The board laid off for
lack of funds S. L. Pierce, a janitor at
the City Hall.
Commissioner Woodward of the
Board of Public made a visit
of inspection yesterday to a district
where certain streets have been illegal
ly fenced in, and as a result notices
were immediately Issued by the Bureau
of Streets to trespassers to remove the
fences at once.
A short and select programme will
be rendered before the lecture. "Father
Gilligan," one of Mr. Yeats' character
istic poems, will be recited by Hazel
Buckley, lime. Cora Roma will sing
Irish ballads and the Elks' Quartet
will render the most ancient and sweet
est of all the Gaelic melodies, "Eibhlin
a Ruin." Tickets for the lecture may
be had at room 87. Flood building.
Mr. Yeats will lecture this afternoon
at the University of Berkeley: on Fri
day at Stanford. He will also give a
lecture In the Santa Clara College thea
ter.
He was invited by the Irish Literary
Society of New York to visit the Unit
ed States and he has lectured at many
of the large universities in the East.
This evening Mr. Yeats will receive a
great ovation at his public lecture in
the Alhambra Theater under the aus
pices of the Leag-ue of the Cross. Sel
dom has there been such anxiety to
meot and hear a man of letters. He is
a charming speaker and has delighted
his Eastern audiences.
"The Wanderings of Oisin," a lengthy
drama, is founded on pre-Christian
tradition. Several of his later works
have received high praise and the Lon
don "Academy" crowned his volume
"The Wind Among the Reeds" as the
best volume of poems of the year. Even
Robert Louis Stevenson fell a Victim to
Yeats' poetry, and from far away
Vailima the novelist wrote the young
author that he had written one of the
three poems of the age.
He is regarded by the Irish race the
world over as their greatest intellec
tual leader of the century, and they
take pride in the "Poet of the Celtic
Twilight," as Mr. Yeats has been
named.
Mr. Yeats is the founder of the Cel
tic revival, which has attracted many
talented poets and writers.' Douglas
Hyde, Lionel Johnson, Nora Hopper,
Moira O'Neill, Katherine Tynan and
others whose names are prominent in
the domain of letters have made the
revival one of the most noteworthy
movements of modern times in Eng
lish literature. It has been Mr. Yeats'
aim to render into English the leg
ends, traditions, folk lore, sagas and
literature of the ancient Gaelic bards.
William Butler Yeats, the distin
guished poet and man of letters of
the Celtic revival, who has come to
Califocriia to lecture at the universi
ties of Berkeley and Stanford, arrived
late last night on the overland from
the East. His visit has been eagerly
looked forward to by friends of the
revival and Jhe literary class of the
city. Few men of the present genera
tion have achieved fame at so early
an age as Mr. Yeats. He is but 36
years of nge and his name is heralded
by the critics.

THEY ACTUALLY
DO THE WORK
Food Eaten Is Worthless Unless Di-
gested â Some Stomachs Must
Have Help.
Food taken into the Stomach which,
from the nature of the rood or. the con-
dition of the stomach, is not digested,
is worse than no food at all. This is a
true statement as far as it goes and a
great many dyspeptics go only this far
I with their reasoning. They argue with
themselves that because their stomachs
do not' do the work given them, they
must be given less work; in other words
they must be starved. It would be Just
as sensible for a business man who is
unable to do all his own work to cut
down his business to his own capacity
as it is for a man to starve himself to
relieve his stomach. The sensible busi^
ness man employs help and goes for-
ward with his business. Likewise the
sensible dyspeptic will employ help for
his stomach and give his body proper
nourishment.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets actually
do the work assigned to them. They re-
lieve weak and overburdened stomachs
of a great portion of digestive action.
Their component parts are identical
with those of the dicestlve fluids and
secretions of the stomach and they sim-
ply take ud the grind and carry on
the. work just the same as-a good,
strong, healthy stomach would do it.
On this account Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are perfectly natural In their
action and effects. They do not cause
any unnatural or violent disturbance
in the stomach or bowels. They them-
selves digest the food and supply the
system with all the nourishment con-
tained in what is eaten and carry out
nature's plans for the sustenance and
maintenance of the body.
How much more sensible is thi3
method than that employed by many
sufferers from weak stomach. By this
means the body and brain get all the
good, nutritious food they need and the
man is properly nourished and .equipped
to carry on his work and perform his
duties. He could not possibly be in \
proper working condition by starving
himself or employing some new fang-
led, insufficient food that does not con-
tain enough nutriment for, a. year-old
baby. A strong man doing strong work
must be properly fed and this applies
to the brain as well as the body.
Stuart's Dyspepsia .Tablets, by re-
lieving the stomach of Its work, enable
it to recuperate and regain* its normal
health and strength. Nature ; repairs
the worn and wasted tissues Just as she
heals and knits the bone of a broken
limb, which is of course not used dur-
ing the process of repair.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets "are for
sale by all druggists i at 50 cents a box
and they are the. one article that the
druggist does not try to sell something
in the place of that's '.'just as good."
Their unqualified merit and success and
the universal demand for them has
placed them within the reach of every
one. - ' ;"Â¦'Â¦- '.'Â¦- - . V 'Â¦
