The Standard Oil Company induced
the railroads to charge him and his

shipped. Rice alleges. These excessive
rates, he declares, varied from 50 per
cent to 333 per cent more than were
reasonable and â¢ were far above the
rates charged to the Standard Ol> Com
pany, and its customers. Not only were
the freight rates higher, but the rail
road companies refused to supply cars
to Rice by which he could make prompt
shipments, and he was otherwise ha
rassed and delayed. . ,..'.
Rice charges that his business at
Marietta, Ohio, was swept away by the
trust.. He had 4000 customers for oil

WASHINGTON,- Aug.* 19.â Firmness is
shown by the United States in dealing
with the serious situation brought
about in Venezuela by the seizure of
the properties of the New York and
Bermudese Asphalt Company. Min
ister Bowen has made strong repre
sentations to President Castro. He has
demanded that the properties be re
leased from the custody of Venezuelan
Receiver A. H. Carner until the case
may be adjudicated by the courts. The
company has several contracts which
it cannot fill as long as the receiver
retains control. Bowen has presented
these facts to President Castro, but it
is understood no satisfactory answer
has been received.
It has been pointed out to Bowen
that the Venezuelan Federal Govern
ment has no authority to order the re
ceiver away from the properties, as he
was appointed by the Superfor, Court.
The United States, however, has
hitherto taken diplomatic action which
has resulted in reversals of the deci
sions of the Superior Court.
When Venezuela first brought suit
against the New York and Bermudese
Company a month ago an emphatic
protest was made. The Venezuelan
Government was informed that the
United States reserved the right to
make further representations after the
Superior Court rendered its "decision,
if that decision was considered a con
travention of justice to American in
terests.
The cruiser Newark, if all is quiet
in Hayti, will] proceed to Cartagena,
Colombia, which is convenient to La
Guayra, the port of Caracas. If the
crisis becomes acute the Newark or
some other ship will make a cruise to
Venezuelan waters.

escort newly arrived strike breakers
to the camp.
An innovation was introduced to
day. A rapid fire gun from the north
blockhouse was placed in a steel gon
dol" ~-d. manned by four gunners,
doubly armed with large caliber and
magazine rifles, was added to a com
p-.-~ of twenty-five Zeigler guards and

BUENOS AYRES, Aug. 19.â The In
surgents have seized another steam
ship, which had on board the Minister
of War and a small escort. The Min
ister and his companions were made
prisoners. The vessel was towing four
lighters, laden with 190 bullocks for the
garrison. These were confiscated.
At the conference on board one of
the insurgents' ships after the bom
bardment of Asuncion last Wednes
day, between the Ministers of Argen
tina, Brazil, Italy and France and the
insurgent leaders, the latter said that
after the Ministers left the vessel they
would fire two more shots â one at the
residence of President Escurra and tha
other at the church â in order to demon
strate the excellence of their artillery.
The shots were fired and both the
President's residence and the church
were hit. No further bombardment has
been reported.
The insurgent commander, with 20O<Â»

One of the insurgent steamships has
sailed for the Villa Hayes, north of the
capital. The Villa Hayes is the only
point which can now be communicated
with. Asuncion Is completely isolated.
The Foreign Ministers have offered
their intervention, to which offer the
insurgent leaders replied that they
would permit President Ezcurra to con
tinue in office, but would demand the
resignation of the Ministers and other
high officials of the Government. The
insurgents* terms were conveyed to thÂ»

The atmosphere became murky and
a dark cloud approaching from the
'southwest was noticed in North St.
' Louis. Suddenly an arm seemed to
shoot downward like a gigantic cable,
twisting and turning. The end touch
ed the ground at Nineteenth and An
gdrodt streets and with incredible
Â¦ swiftness and force swept east along
*A:iÂ£-?lrodt street for ten blocks. Then
It turned north and swept three blocks

- The tornado- then jumped to about
the middle of the river and encoun
.tereiS a ferry-boat, which it turned and
.i-shed about, but did not sink. The
tuir.ado once more lifted and struck
the Illinois shore near Madison, where
it â¢ demolished several dwellings, the
Litderkranz Hail and blew down a
portion of the Madison Cooper Works,
killing John Ellington. Severe damage
was done to the buildings at Venice
and Granite City, which adjoins Madi-
Bon. and a number of persons were in
jured.
So quickly did the tornado sweep
thiough North St. Louis that the citi
zens could scarcely comprehend %vhat
had occurred. In the stillness that fol-
Imved ciies were heard on all sides as
the terror-stricken persons ran about
the streets.
Not a telegraph, telephone or trolley
pole was left standing along the streets
swept by the tornado and trees were
piled in heaps. The path of the tor
nado was about a block and a half
â¢ wide, along which houses were un
roofed. window panes broken, several
factories partially demolished and the
streets littered with debris.
. A Broadway trolley car containing
eleven passengers was struck by fall-
Ing telegraph poles and wrecked. The
passengers had a remarkable escape
from injury and only the motorman
receii-ed slight bruises.
Probably the heaviest loss suffered
by a single concern was the destruc
tion accomplished at the NIedringhaus
Rolling Mi!!, which covers two squares.
The big smokestack was blown down
and half the plant was demolished, en
tailing damage estimated at $25,000.
Six employes were injured in this
. plant.
CHURCH IS DAMAGED.
Part of the roof and two cupolas
â¢were blown from the Catholic church
of Our Lady of Good Counsel. The side
of the Buck Btove and Range Com
pany plant was blown in.
There were many remarkable escapes
from death by drivers of delivery
wagons. Debris carried along by the
tornado crushed wagons like eggshells
and hurled the drivers into the street.
â¢One driver was crushed, but will re
cover. The others escaped with slight
injuries. Immediately following the
storm ambulances were rushed to the
scene and fire departments responded
from all directions.
A concert was in progress in Festi

The fire started in a fruit-box' fac

of the large wooden building be
fore it was discovered. The heat was
terrific and the firemen could not get
near enough to limit the fire. The
flames spread in a few minutes to
Curry & Jones' opera-house and the
stable on the east, and to McMahon

the attempt was successful. Heroic ef
forts were made to save the block to
the south, but they were futile. The
Commercial Hotel was soon destroyed,
but by almost superhuman efforts on
the part of the firemen the Martinez
Hotel building was spared, though the
west side is scorched to a tinder.
The streets to the east of the burned
district, as far as the Court House, are
packed with goods of every descrip
tion. The business houses in the two
blocks to the east of those burned were
cleared of their contents, but they were
saved, the wind shifting just in time.

Galen M. FIstier, a graduate of the
University of California, who is in this
city in the interest of the Young Men's
Christian Association of Japan, of
which he is secretary, located at
Tokio, lectured last .evening in the
auditorium of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association building. His subject
was "Jo pan and Its Men," and he ex
pressed his belief that "Japan is fight
ing for the worldâ that she is battling
for righteousness."
"I am proud that I represent Japan,
even though unofficially," said Fisher,
"and I say this in the name of Him
that I serve. Japan is now engaged
in a conflict for righteousness and for
the world and this fact historians will
acknowledge more positively when
time has given events of to-day 'their
proper perspective.
"Christianity is making rapid pro
gress in Japan. The minds of her peo
ple are open to all truths no matter
whence they come. Truly, as a great
writer has said, we may well clas3
Japan to-day with the Christian na
tions. In her public affairsâ in the war
in which she Is engaged to-dayâ she Is
dominated by Christian principles,
which her enemy professes, but does
not practice. I repeat that victory for
the Japanese arms will not only benefit
the world, generally speaking, but will
benefit Russia as much as it-will Japan
herself. . It will teach the nation of the
great white Czar that the outgrowth
of despotism cannot combat the out
growth of progress and enlightened
civilization.
"The more yoli know the Japanese
the more you Jove them. I have found
that they are capable of friendships as
loyal and true for even alien peoples
ns Christian hearts can cement. The
cry of 'yellow peril' Is absurd. Like
America, which is the policeman for
the western hemisphere, Japan is the
policeman of the East. She will drive
back from the borders of China the
hosts that are menacing the peace and
advancement of the earth and then all
Asia, guided by her light, will rise to
the times and Christianity will spread
over all the earth."
Mr. Fisher's lecture was illustrated
with many striking lantern slides,
which were greatly appreciated.

MILWAUKEE, WIs.. Aug. 19.âGov
ernor La .Follette opened his campaign
at Eau Claire this evening. It is evi
dent from the Governor's initial effort
that there will be no peace or harmony
within the Republican ranks in Wis
consin until he has succeeded in win
ning control. He says so himself. But
more sensational than this was the at
tack made by the Governor on his op
ponents and the corporations. La Fc!
lette declared that this was a cam
paign of principles, not of men, and
that one of the principles was tne pri
mary election.
"I knew Jn 1896 I had votrs enough
among the delegates elected to the
State Convention To nominate me,"
said he. "These votes were pledged
to me. I saw them taken away from
me by unlawful means, which should
have sent some men to the penitentiary.
Delegates were taken to "a room ln a
hotel and there offered money to
change their votes. None of the men
took the money, but they afterward
came to me and told me about it. They
said that in the room in question
money in large bills was stacked upon
a table and held down by paper
weights.
"One of the bosses of that time came
to me and said: 'Now, La Follette,
we've got you beat, but If you keep
still and don't squeal we'll take care
of you when the time comes.*
"I refused, but events took place
just as he had predicted. I then de
termined to begin an Investigation aud
direct my efforts to correct the evils
which confronted the people." \
The Governor said that his Investi
gations showed the close relationship
: of the bosses to the corporations.

Among the buildings in Port Arthur

Sons' American warehouse.
CHEFU, Aug. 19, 9 p. m.â Firing at
Port Arthur by big guns was heard dis
tinctly here ,to-night v
Late advices from Port Arthur say
that PalungchangT although retaken by
the Russians, has not been occupied
by either side. The Russian batteries
have contented themselves with pre
venting the Japanese reoccupying this
position, and planting guns which
would command the Russian warships
in the harbor.. : . .
Russian naval officers believe-that the
Japanese battleship Mikasa was sunk
in the engagement of August 10. They
declare that while the Japanese con
centrated their fire on the Cesarevitch
the. Russians centered theirs on the
Mikasa, Admiral Togo's flagship. It
was the Mikasa which the Retvizan
attempted to ram during the fight. The
Retvizan had been receiving a gruel
ing and her captain suddenly gave an
order to steer into the midst- of the
Japanese \esstls and head for the Mi
kasa. So fully surrounded was the Ret
vizan that atone time she was using
every one cf ,her guns< One Japanese,
shot rendered her turret unworkable,
but repairs were made in ten minutes.
The Russian warships which return
ed to Port Arthur declare that Admiral
Wltheoffs last order was to return to
Port Arthur. This disagrees with a
previous statement from Tsingchou, al
leging that the Admiral's last ordrr
was not to return.
Commercial business at Port Arthur
Is said to be at a complete standstill.
The people are living ln bomb-proof
houses. A belief on both sides of the
contending forces that the other side
is abusing the Red Cros3 has led to
the feeling that that emblem is of lit
tle protection. The Russians claim that
the Japanese use the flag to cover re
connoitering parties. Recently a Rus
sian sharpshooter noticed a Japanese
officer and a party of thirteen carrying
a Red Cross flag. He reported that he
believed the Japanese were shamming
that they were wounded. The Russian
officer in command gave the sharp
shooter permission to fire on them. The
sharpshooter killed or wounded all of
them. As fast as one dropped the Re1
Cross flag another one picked it up.
It is also reported that the Japanese
attempt to deceive the Russians into
touching off their electric ground mines
by driving cattle over them in the dark
ness. This ruse has, it is said, result
ed merely ln affording the besieged a
fresh supply of beef.
The Russians declare that Takushan
is doing the Japanese but little good,
as they are frequently driven from
that position by artillery fire. They
are unable to mount guns. \

ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 20.â Acute
anxiety, prevails regarding the situa
tion at Port Arthur on account of the
desperate character of the fighting re
ported as taking place, though the War
Department does not seem to believe
that the danger of the fall of .the fort
ress is so imminent as is generally as
f-exted- According to advices received
by the War Office there is still an am
ple supply of ammunition and of pro
visions there. While it is realized that
the Japanese probably outnumber the
defenders six or seven fold, the great
â¢strength of the fortifications it is be
lieved will do much to make up for the
disparity in numbers.
Upon one point there is absolute
unanimity here, namely, that if the fort
ress fall the .fleet win not fall into the
hands of the Japanese. --On this point
the Admiralty's instructions are of the
most imperative character.
Vice Admiral Prince Outkomsky has
been ordered, should the worst come, to
*?ally forth for a death struggle, and
there is no question here that these in
structions will be carried out, both in
letter and in spirit, but if for any rea
mon^. iinal sortie prove to be impossible
the admiral is to destroy his ships and
to make certain that their wreckage
fhall be absolutely irreparable.
ln the meantime Vice Admiral Ro
.Ic-stvensky's Baltic squadron. Including
the battleship Orel, is standing off
â¢Kronstadt with steam up. It is popu
larly expected that the squadron will
tail at any hour, and it is quite true
that it is ready for almost immediate
departure, but regarding the question
of sailing there is a difference of opin
ion among the naval authorities. It is
held on the one hand that the imme
diate sailing of the squadron would be
the best policy, and on the other theory
that should it arrive within two months
ft would find Vice Admiral Togo's fleet
in an infinitely worse condition than if
the Japanese were allowed the whole
winter to repair and refit the ships.
The advocates cf an immediate sail-
Ing hold that the port of Vladivostok
is capable of receiving the squadron,
even should entrance into Port Arthur
prove to be impracticable, and they
v.ish to treat the Port Arthur squad
ron for the present as a negative quan
tity, letting: the Baltic Sea vessels meet
the Japanese in the latter's present
weakened condition without relying for
eny certain assistance either on the part
of Vice Admiral Ouktomsky or Vice
Admiral Skrydloff.
Other officials hold that it would be
unwise to risk sending the Baltic
squadron to the Far East until the sit
uation at Port Arthur has heen cleared
and until it is known what conditions
th? squadron would be likely to find on
it? arrival.
RFSSIAN GrXBOAT SUNK.
Vessel of U10 Otvajani Type Strikes a
Japanese Mine.
TOKIO, Aug. 19.â A Russ.an gunboat
of the Otvajanl type struck a mine and
Fcnk off L>aoti Promontory, the extreme
southern point of the Kwantung Pe
niiisuia. en which Port Arthur is sit
uated, at 8 o'clock on Thursday night.
CHEFU, Aug. 19.â Major L. L. Sea
man, a specialist in. military surgery,
who has seen much of the Japanese
hospitals and who has been with the
Chunchuses, or Chinese bandits, near
Mukden, has arrived at Chefu. He
says that the Japanese are giving proof
of the benefits to be deriveil from non
interference with wounds on the field,
where they content themselves with the
application of first aid bandages and
antiseptics, leaving the more serious
was to be done in the hospitals at
home. The result of this practice has
been that many men suffering from
bullet wounds at the front are nearly
well when they reach Japan.
On one^hospital .ship returning to
Japan from the front there were 2200
wounded men and there was not a
single death on board during the trip.
Three per cent will cover all the deaths
among the wounded who have been
returned, to Japan after having re
ceived first-aid treatment only.
Russian wounded captured by the
Japanese have been treated in a simi
lar maner and the recoveries among
these men is scarcely less in proportion
than among the Japanese. .
A new complication has been dis
covered in the wounds sustained in this
war, due to the extraordinary high
speed of small caliber bullets, which
produce aneurisms by their speed. Ma
jor Seaman saw twenty-seven opera
tions performed for the relief of this
new condition.
After having spent some time in
Japan, Major Seaman, accompanied by
Captain Charles T. Boyd of the Tenth
United States Cavalry, was the guest
of Chungtzorlln, a Chunchuse chief,
near Sinminting, where the Chun
chuses number 10,000 men.
The major declares these men to be
in the employ of the Japanese, who pay
the infantry fifteen taels a month and
the cavalry twenty-five taels a month.
There are many Japanese offlcerb
among these forces, who are used to
harass the Russians.
During the visit of Major Seaman
and Captain Boyd the bandits brought
in the heads of five Cossacks on pikes.
Theso Cossacks had been part of a de-'
tachment of thirty-five men who were
engaged in securing 1000 head of cattle.
After the bandits defeated the Russian
detachment they appropriated the
cattle.
The Chunchuses pride themselves on
their horsemanship, and the visiting
officers owe their welcome among them
10 some West Point riding tricks shown
them by Captain Boyd.
The attack of the Chunchuses on the
Cossack detachment with the cattle re
sulted in a force of 3000 Cossacks,
marching out to avenge the killing of
their comrades. Thereupon the robber
chief said his visitors had better go, as
he could not undertake to protect
them. Consequently Major Seaman
and Captain Boyd left the bandits'
headquarters.
DESPAIR IX ST. PETERSBURG.
Rus&inh Naval Â¦ Disasters - Dishearten
the Admiralty.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 19.â A feel
ing almost akin to despair reigns in
the much-tried Russian admiralty. The
official report of Vice Admiral Skryd
loff, coming on the heels of the known
losses sustained by the Port Arthur
squadron in its desperate sortie of Au
gust 10, not only confirming the sink
ing of the Rurik, but showing that the
damages received by the Gromoboi and
Rossia in the fight with Vice Admiral
Kamin-.ura's squadron were even
greater than expected, completes the
crushing nature of the blow to Russia's
ill-starred naval forces in the Far East.
So far as the immediate future is
concerned, the admiralty does not dis
guise the fact that the Vladivostok
squadron is destroyed. The only conso
lution found is in the words of praise
bestowed on the officers and men and
the unequal character of the fight, Rus
sian naval experts, by the system of
coefficients, figuring that the inferior
ity of the Vladivostok squadron in
armor and euns was 69 to 200.
it is confirmed that the losses of offi
cers and men on board the Rossia and
Gromoboi were 50 per cent of the for
mer and 25 per cent of the latter, show
ing the dreadful havoc caused by the
fire from the Japanese snips, even at
a range exceeding three miles. Pri
vate reports say the decks of the Ros
sia were veritable shambles.

"Services Rendered by Russia to the

ports as a base of operations, which
ruined the maritime commerce of the
Northern States. = ; =,;

his surgical achievements at his hospital in
â¢ Buffalo, but nearly a third of a century aeo
fce discovered certain roots and herbs
â¢which were nature's remedies, and suc-
ceeded in potting them up in a form that
xrould be easily procured and ready to use.
This he called Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery. It maintains the patient's nu-
trition by enabling him to eat, retain, digest
and assimilate nutritious food. It over-
comes gastric irritability and symptoms of
indigestion, and in this way fever, night-
6wcats, headaches, etc., are done away with.
ilt fortifies "the body against the germs of
.consumption, grip and malaria, it builds
nip the tissues and puts on healthy flesh.
; Those desiring to know something about
ithe body in health and disease, also medi-
Icine and surgery, without technicalities,
â¢should read 'the "Common Sense Medical
Adviser," which can be bad for 31 cents in

IX THE GOLF TOURNAMENT
The militia will be paid off here on
Thursday afternoon.* August 25, and
will begin making preparations at the
same time to break camp. Early Fri
day morning they will begin move
ment to their home stations.
The problem for to-morrow will in
clude a march of all troops here from
the camp at 6 a, m. to a spot some
three miles distant. From that point
will begin probably the most interest
ing and at the same time most intri
cate maneuvers of the field exercises,
the deployment of a division. This will
be under the direct command of Gen
eral MacArthur.
The First Brigade was reviewed by
Colonel A. C. Markley on the south
grounds and the Second Brigade by
Colonel H. C. Ward on the grounds in
front of the division headquarters. The
troops were all in high spirits after
their day's rest and entered with en
thusiasm Into their work. The Signal
Service Corps, Including all members
of that body here, Federal and State
militia, under command of Major
George O. Squier, went through a pre
paratory drill and Inspection of the
division flying field telegraph train at
4:30 p. m. Over 100 men took part in
the drill. The lance, field and wire
wagons were distinctive features In the
work. The drill was of a highly In
structive character. Â»
Dress reviews of both brigades took
place at 5:30 p. m. and the appearance
of the troops brought forth admiration
from all sides. The hill lining the
parade grounds was covered with peo
ple, automobiles and several four-in
hand coaches.
CAMP ATASCADERO, Aug. 19.â The
roar of- battle that has marked the pro
ceedings of the last few days to-day
gave way to peace and stillness.
It was a day of rest for alL The
problem of reconnaissance as scheduled
was omitted, that the troops might
rest and be in readiness for the long
event of to-morrow. The early part
of the day was spent by many hun
dreds of the troops in the enjoyment
of shower baths.
The principal event of the day was
the division drill of the hospital corps,
which took place at 3:30 o'clock In the
afternoon, beginning at a point on the
extreme south of the camp. The pro
gramme had been mapped out by Col
onel A. C. Girard, chief surgeon. It
was executed by Major William Ste
phenson, acting chief surgeon for the
day. More than 200 officers, surgeons,
and enlisted men took part In the ex
ercises. It proved of great value to
the militia. The drill was complete In
every detail.
Major Stephenson acted In a double
capacity, being In command of the
First Brigade. Able assistance In the
general drill was given by Major W.
P. Kendall, who had charge of the Sec
ond Brigade. Among the officers of
the National Guard who took a lively
part in the proceedings were Lieuten
ant Colonel J. Pedlar of the Sixth; Ma
jor W. W. Roblee of the Seventh; "W.

to look up the case there.
. The stranger 1 ? letter bore the date of

days. Keene was sober and well be
:"h?.\ccT. The circumstances indicate that
forr.e accident or foul play has befallen
Hm. Keene is 60 years old and a Civil
>Var reteran.
Inclosed in the letter was Keene's
rr.eul ticket and some other of his
â¢papers. The articles ha<5 not been in
.the t\-ater. The writer of the letter ex
plained this fact by eaying that before
-venturing in the beat Keene had given
?.'s papers to him for safekeeping. The
letter did net give the date of the
â¢ drowning.
eTOCKTON. Aug. 19.â Sprague S.
Keene, an employe cf the local pest-
is missing. A peculiar mystery
surrounds his absence. To-day a letter
â¢came from San Francisco announcing
that the xnan had been drowned, and it
Is feared that Keene has been a victim
cf foul play.
Keene was supposed to be in San
Francisco. He obtained a week's leave
c? absence laet Saturday. He said that
he was going to LoÂ£l and Sacramento
and hose by way of San Francisco. By
to-day's neon rr.ail Assistant Postmas

fn San Francisco, whose name is with
held, stating that Keene had gone out
In a rowt>oat en the bay with the writer
cf the letter, that they had taken turn

Several of the masculine guests were
favored In that they were permitted to
come In ordinary evening dress, al
though "small clothes" were considered
preferred. J. J. Wysong went to the
table in a superb suit of whits satin
and brocade of the Louis XVI period,
and Richard Dlxey, who came from
Lenox for the ball, wore a gorgeous
rajah's costume of white brocade su
perbly embroidered In gold and en
riched with many Eastern Jewels.
Harry Lehr also wore a costume of
white of the Louis XIV period. Berger*s
waiters, who served the supper, were
all dressed In white duck, even to their
shoes.
NEWPORT. R. L. Aug. 19.â New
port's first ball of the summer, and erne
of the most elaborate given in many
years, was given to-night at RosecUff.
the beautiful villa of Mrs. Hermann
Oelrlchs. To the ordinary Parisian of
high life, the "bal Wane" signifies an
entertainment for debutantes, who are
not expected to wear gowns of white,
but any color they desire. To-night it
was different and the affair might bet
ter be called a "ball In white." as all
the women wore gowns of white ma
terialâchiffon, silk, gauze or brocade.
They were not of any particular
period, but such as might be worn at
any ball here or In New York.
A distinctive character was given to
the assemblage by the handsomely
dressed women, who wore white wigs
of powdered hair, dressed with their
superb jewels, and the men who werÂ»
attired In hunting coats with knee
breeches of black or white satin, jabots
of lace and rhinestone buckles on their
pumps and at the knee. Some of them
wore wigs with queues, tied with black
ribbons, and others had powdered hair.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 19.â The abroga
tion of the agreement between the Pan
ama Railroad and the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company, which monopolizes
the Pacific Coast carrying trade from
the Isthmus, was considered by the
President and his Cabinet to-day. The
jobbers of the Pacific Coast, who feel
that for years they have been obliged
to pay exorbitant freight rates by rea
son of this combination, have brought
great Influence to bear upon the admin
istration to dissolve the contract.
The United States now owns sixty
nlne seventieths of the Panama Rail
road stock, but the directors now hold-
Ing office were elected before the road,
with the rest of the property on the
canal strip, passed to the ownership of
the United States. It was understood
at the time of the transfer that the
thirteen old directors, although they
were entitled to hold office until April 1
next, would Â¦willingly and gracefully
step oat and permit the members of the
American Canal Commission gradually
to take their places. Three members
of the canal commission are now di
rectors of the railroad, but they cannot
control. But Secretary Taft, under
whose control lies the affairs of the
canal zone, has not met with this will
ingness to defer to the United States to
abrogate the contract now existing. It
Is necessary that six months' notice
shall be given.
Although the administration with
holds the announcement of what It
Â¦would like to do, there is evidently con
siderable annoyance over the fact that
the directory cannot be at once filled
with representatives of the United
States If It were then
deemed advisable to respond affirma
tively to the plea of the Pacific Coast
Jobbers that the contract with the Pa
ciflo Mail Steamship Company be abro
gated, the breaking of the monopoly
would rest merely upon the word of the
President. At present, however, the
directors cling tenaciously to their po
sitions.
It Is the intention of the combination
of Pacific Coast jobbers to establish a
line of Bteamers between the United
States coast and Panama if the monop
oly now existing Is not broken. The
President is asked to abrogate the con
tract on the ground that It is in con
travention of public policy generally
for the United States to foster or en
courage monopoly.

The engineers will proceed from here
en a tour of the San Joaquin River,
carefully examining: the course of the
stream and gathering data which may
be used in connection with information
acquirtd on the Sacramento River and
its tributaries, the Yuba and Feather
rivers, in a comprehensive scheme of.
reclamation and river improvement to
be submitted to the next Legislature.
The Gastern engineers were greatly
impressed with the situation at Marys
vllle. Major Dabney, chairman of the
commission, in response to a question,
said the only criticism he cared to
makf en the levees was that the Yuba
River might, by suitable treatment,
be compelled to do much of the work
of the levee building by arresting much
of the detritus which flows down iL
At Daguerre Point, Colonel Heuer,
Engineer Vischer and the State Debris
Commissioner, explained to the visitors
the object of the great cut whlfch is
being made through that promontory.
Major Dabney remarked there could
scarcely be too many barriers to hold
back the debris in the river bed, even
If they were only half a mile apart.

These teams are evenly matched and
it would be a close match if they met

Dickie Ctip Contest Will B*Â» Decided
To-Morro\v Week on the Waters
of Sproekels Lake.
The model yachtsmen will hold their
most important race of the year on the
2Sth inst., when the first-class sloops
v.ill race for the Dickie cup. Only boats
measuring from forty-five to fifty
inches, water line, will be eligible. This
race will bring together the best boats
of the Spreckels Lake fleet. It has not
been decided on which of the three
courses the race will be held. The di
rection of the wind on the day of the
race will determine this. If the. wind is
northwest the longest course, measur
ing 869 feet, will be used. The shortest
course is used when the wind is from
west to southwest. This course meas
ures CT6 feet. The middle distance
course of 760 feet is used when the wind
is from the west.
Two boats are tied for first place in
the pennant race for the season. The
Santee. owned by Todd & Adams, and
the Ar>aehe. owned by William Roeck
ner. have each won three pennants.
The Fannie, owned by Commodore Col
lier, and the Roma, owned by Thorsen,
have won two pennants. The following
boats have won once: Imp, owned by
London; Piute. owned by Forrest; So
phie, owned by Brennan; Surprise,
owned by Brown, and Zampa, owned
by Jurgens.
L. Seavey launched a 72-inch sloop

The Scottish bowling green at Golden
Gate Park presents a more animated
appearance on Saturday afternoons
now that the players have returned to
town. The rinks have been well pat
ronized, but the absence of many of
the active players made it difficult to
indulge in tournament play.
Of the two tournaments, which were
commenced at the same time, the
doubles has been by far the more suc
cessful. One reason for this is that
only those entered their, names Who
were desirous of playing. In the
singles the names of all the club mem
bers were drawn, regardless of whether
the players could or cared to play.
The final match of the doubles played
last Saturday was the most interesting
of the tournament. M. L. Crowe and
J. M. Duncan carried off the honors
and their victory was a well earned
one. Their opponents In the finals
were two of the best bowlers in the
club. In fact Eaton and Dr. Hamilton
were picked by the majority to win
the 'tournament.
Another 1 doubles tournament was ar
ranged during the week. The' best
players are anxious to have another
match with .Crowe and Duncan and
the tournament was arranged to de
termine whether the new champions
could be beaten. Fourteen of the club's
best players have joined forces and if
Crowe and Duncan again carry off the
honors all 'hats will come off to them.
The tournament will commence this
afternoon.
The drawing resulted as follows:
M. L. Crowe and J. M. Duncan ti. Robert
Park and Dr. Hamilton; A. A. McVicar and
ThomaB McKaught vs. Joseph Gray and Y. C.

Since the Ariel Rowing Club has
been established in its commodious
new quarters near the Arctic Oil
Works, its members have shown great
activity in aquatic sports. Every Sun
day nearly all the available boats are
in use. Several members have been
practicing in the outrigged skiff,
among them being A. W. Keegan, Her
man Opeldt and J. Larsen.
Alec Keegan is an old oarsman, hav
ing been a representative of the Ariels
in the junior, intermediate and senior
barges. Recently he has taken to the
outrigged skiff, having rowed in the
junior skiff race at the annual cham
pionship regatta held on Lake Mer
ritt on the Fourth of July. He will
represent the Ariel club in the out
rigged skiff in the Admission day re
gatta â¢ to take place on the same
waters.
Herman Opeldt is a promising oars
man, possessed of great physical
strength. He rowed No. 3 in the junior
barge crew of the Ariels at the Fourth
of July regatta. J. C. Larsen is an
Australian and won many prizes for
rowing before he came to the United
States.
Ariel Rowing Club Is Devel
oping Some Clever Skiff
men for the Regatta.
In doubles the home players look to
have a splendid chance to land on top.
MacGavin and Murdock will play to
gether and they should make a strong
combination. The only team they have
to fear is Bell and Overton. These two
will make a good team, as both are
great net players.
Aside from, the cracks already men
tioned there will be others who have
a chance. Will Allen, George Baker.
Clarence Griffin and several players
from the south wil make the best play
ers work to beat them.
The women's events will be more in
teresting than last year for the reason
that several of the players have Im
proved noticeably and should make a
good showing. The presence jof Miss
May Sutton, the United States cham
pion, will greatly increase the atten
dance. The champion will have no
trouble winning any event she enters,
as she Is playing better than she did
last year. Miss Hotchkiss, Miss Rat
cliffe and Miss Edwards of Berkeley
are expected to make a good showing
against the other Suttons.
Mrs. Seymour and her daughter have
decided to come to San Rafael again
this year. Mrs. Seymour will bring
four or five young ladles from the
south with her. The* visitors sent word
that they would come if a consolation
singles could be arranged. They fig
ured they would have no chance with
the Suttons in the main event The
tournament committee met last night
and decided to add to the events a
consolation singles for women '
The tournament played last' Sunday
at the park was the most interesting
doubles ever held on the public courts
The poorer teams were given larger
handicaps than usual and the matches
were nearly all close. Despite the
liberality of the handicapper only one
team receiving better than "owe odds"
is left in the competition. When the
four remaining teams come together
to-morrow some good matches will re
sult. George Janes and Herbert Long
will receive odds of "over 3-6" from
Charles Dunlap and Charles Foley.
The approaching coast championship
tennis tournament will be the most
interesting in years. There have been
greater players in the competition in
the past but they were never more
evenly matched. All of the cracks
from Southern California have entered
and the home players will have some
good I men to dispose of before they
meet the champion.
While it is not definitely known that
Champion Bell will defend his title, it
is considered almost a certainty he
will. He is in the East playing in the
Newport tournament and will have
ample time to return and play on the
9th. Fritz Overton. Trowbridge Hen
drick and Simpson Sinsabaugh sent in
their names during the week. Overton
is the cleverest of the three and has
come to the front with a rush. He is
a strong player and the man who beats
him should win the tournament. Over
ton beat Bell in the Ocean Park tour
nament and won first honors. Slnsa
baugh and Hendrick are not quite as
clever as Overton, but at times they
play great tennis.
This part of the State will have
three good representatives. Drum
mond MacQavin, Percy Murdock and
Reuben Hunt are playing better than
they did last year and each Is con
ceded an excellent chance to win the
championship.
It Is about a tossup between Mur
dock and MacGavin; Hunt did not play
here last year, but must be playing
much better than formerly. He won
the Northwestern championship this
year and has made a fine showing in
the East.
Both teams will put forth strenuous
efforts to win. as each club has the
same percentage in the table for the
championship pennant. As the San
Francisco County team, by defeating
the Pacific eleven in last Sunday's
match, gained first place, the loser of
to-day's contest will drop to third
place.
Last Sunday the San Francisco
County team, which up to that day
had the same percentage as the Pa
cific Club, gained an easy victory, de
feating the scarlet and black eleven
by 87 runs for the loss of only two
wickets. E. M. Petersen, b. Jamleson,
68, and W. R. Stewart, c. Storrs, b.
Bowly, 11, were the only batsmen who
lost their wickets. H. B. Richardson
being not out 88, and H. F. Pepys
scoring 20 not put. H. E. Boulton, H.
Roberts, T. H. A. Tiedemann Jr., A. C.
Chadwick, T. J. A. Tiedemann, H.
Dixon and A. Dayies di& not go to the
bat. D. Jamiesori took one wicket for
42 runs and H. D. Bowly one for 23
runs.
The â¢ innings were declared closed
when 200 runs had been scored and the
Pacifies, having .no hope of winning,
went In to make a draw if possible.
But none of the Pacific batsmen, ex
cept Wilding, who hit about freely for
49 runs, E. H. Wilkes (19) and E. H.
M. Lannowe (17), made any stand
against the San Francisco County
bowlers.. A. Davieg took four wickets
for 10 runs, H. B'. Richardson captured
four for 38, "H. Roberts one for 25 and
H. Dixon one for 25. The whole Pa
cific team was out for 113 runs. Had
the Pacifies been able to keep their
wickets up for ten minutes longer, the
game would have been drawn and each
team would have had a percentage of
.55. The percentages of the -clubs Is
shown in the following table:

The usual cricket match between a
team of sailors from British vessels
laid up in Oakland harbor and an

Wingfleld-Digby, chaplain of the Sea

To-morrow the Pacific and Alameda

1904. The Pacific Club will be selected
from Jo-hn Myers (captain), E. H.

Dr. O. N. Taylor, W. Petherick, B. M.

The baseball war between the East
and the West will probably be waged
again. Ned Hanlon of Brooklyn has
challenged the Pacific Coast League,
and his defi will just about be taken up
this time. He insists that Joe Corbett
is his and that he will have him. It's
about a thousand to one shot that Hen
ry Harris will call the bluff, and then
it's fight once more.
The Pacific Coast League has been
getting the worst of all the deals made
in the East, and the magnates of the
coast are becoming tired of this sort
of thing and are just about ready to
show right. If Corbett is taken away
from Harris his team will be materially
weakened and he will lose the best
drawing card he ever had. He will
hardly submit to this without saying
something.
Then there is liable to be more trou
ble in store for the coast league, and
right at home at that. It will be re
membered that James Morley got the
worst of the Dillon deal, and, of course,
he is very likely to make a talk to the
effect that as he was made to stand
for the rulings of the big Eastern
manipulators Harris should not be
granted any special privileges. This will
create another complication and may
develop a new tajigle.
The Oakland team continues to slide
down the toboggan at a remarkably
fast pace. It is too bad to see a good
ball team like Oakland fall by the way
side. When the season opened there
was not a nine in the league that had
it on the Commuters one single bit.
Now they are all In. Were It not for
the grand box work of Jimmy Buchan
an Oakland would not have any per
centage at all for the second half. If
Buchanan were pitching for a team
that played the game he might have a
chance to show his true worth as a
pitcher.
It Is unfortunate Uncle Henry cannot
put his full team in the field against
the Tigers. Meany will not be able to
play for many days yet, and Miller is
not right, even though he is holding
down second. Meany's timely hits will
be missed Badly. The Tigers have start
ed out to paw the home team harshly,
and the present series looks like theirs
to a certainty.
Portland continues to be a surprise.
With a battered up aggregation in the
field the Brownies occasionally get in
and beat the best of them. Dugdale
made all kinds of promises to the fans
that he would give them a ball team,
but surely he does not expect to make
a flash with that motley collection now
under his control. *

There will be no meeting of the
Interstate Coursing Club until the
night of the draw for the Futurity. At
that time officials will be appointed and
the prize money will be apportioned.
E. O. Brown is here from Los An
geles with a string of dogs, including
the southern champion, New Home
Boy. He has also several Futurity
candidates owned by Dr. Weldon of
San Pedro.
The annual meet of the California
Coursing Committee last week at
Ingleside Park was an unqualified suc
cess. The committee is in a position
to carry on its work for the develop
ment of coursing for another year.
The managers of the coursing parks
are discussing the desirability of a
strict pay gate. It is thought it would
place the sport on a higher plane and
better prizes could be offered.
The sates of Union Park will be
opened this afternoon for the first
Saturday in many months. The first
round of a 116-dog stake for non-win
ners will provide the card. The run
ning will commence upon the arrival of
the 12 o'clock coursing train from Third
and Townsend streets. The remaining
rounds of to-day's stake and a class
stake in its entirety will be run to
morrow. The likely winners:
Class stake â Full Moon. HcVey, Richard
Anton. Hector, . The Referee. Barge, Silver
He* In, Charter Member.
One of the men to whom it has been
brought home is James Carroll. He
listed a litter by Wild Tralee-Rosi
nante, which has shown no class up
to the present time. Mr. Carroll has
another litter by Bright Gold-Columbia,
all the members of which are crack
performers. These he failed to list and
they must remain in their kennel when
the rich stake is being decided.
The listing fee is Email, while the
fact that a fast puppy is eligible for
the Futurity adds largely to its value.
If at the end of the firs,t year the puppy
shows no promise, further payments
need not be made.
Following the Futurity, which will be
run at Union Park on September 3 and
4, will come the Junior Champion
Stake. All greyhounds under two years
of age are eligible for this event. It is
always an interesting fixture, as the
winner of the Futurity usually meets
the bost of the greyhounds dot in that
event.
The coursing men who failed to list
their greyhounds in the Futurity are
commencing to see how shortsighted
they were. The stake this year will
have a total valuation of about $2000,
of which 5800 will go to the winner and
$400 to the runner-up.

The board yesterday filed demurrers
to the complaints of Jonas Erlanger-
Davis Company, Schultz, Hansen &
Co., Webster & Dunbar and G. B.
Olcese & Co. An affidavit wa*s filed
by James M. Foy, secretary of the
Commissioners, setting forth the
charge of Lecari and the official ac
tion of the board in revoking the per
mits. : ;. '
The members of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners have pleaded
that the local Superior Court has no
jurisdiction over their persons nor of
the subject matter of. the action
brought by several produce commis
sion firms to enjoin the board from re
straining them from selling perish
able products on the public wharves.
The board revoked the permits of
six firms upon complaint of Charles
J. Lecari, who charged that they were
violating the Woodward law in that
they would not sell potatoes in less
than fifty-sack lots and onions in less
than twenty-five sack lots, whereas
the lots prescribed by the law were
ten and five sack lots respectively.
When the dealers asked for an in
junction they set forth that the sale
of the larger lots was customary with
the trade and that otherwise they had
violated no law or rule of the com
mission.
Demur to Injunction Suits With Plea
That Superior Court Has No
Jurisdiction.
The court humorously suggested
that the defendants could save lots of
trouble by paying the $650,000.
Besides the regular demurrers one
of the attorneys raised the point of
the running of the statute of limita
tions. Lapique said that he had had
no notice of that phase of the objec
tion and demanded a week for its con
sideration. Thereupon the point was
withdrawn. ":.\
Lapique's complaint covered some
fifty pages of typewritten matter and
was- divided into twenty separate com
plaints. The defendants included Abe
liuef and other lawyers, deputies, ad
ministrators of estates, friends, rela
tives and others accused of conspiring
against him. The usual technical de
murrers against ' the complaint were
iiled by several of the defendants and
after tlie arguments Judge Hunt took
the matter under submission. Lapique
answered the plea that his complaint
was insuiHcient by citing two authori
ties to the court. â¢ ,
John Lapique, who acquired his
knowledge of the law by diligent
study during the greater part of sev
enteen years spent in prison and in
the insane asylum, yesterday stood for
awhile by his legal guns against a bat
tery of a half dozen regular lawyers.
He appeared in his own behalf in
Judge Hunt's court to oppose the de
murrers of a few of the fortv-four de
fendants named in his sensational
complaint of a month ago, wherein he
asked the court to award him $650,
000 damages for malicious prosecu
tion, i

score of 11 to 6. Though there was a
scare in the seventh, when the Califor
nlans made four runs, the game came
to Portland on a platter.
The first run came in the third, when
Hurley let the ball slip between his
hands. Spies took two bags, stole third
and went home on Bernard's single.
Finally, with two down and with Spen
cer at first, Hurley bunted to Smith,
who missed. Chase failed to stop a ball
and then threw wild over third. Spencer
and Hurley scored. McCreedie's three
bag swat helped a lot. Chase did not
stop his man. Beck's two-bagger scored
the last of six runs. Fumbles by Cas

Loo Loos four runs in the seventh. Cra

STOPS DRINKING AND
ENDS HIS LIFE
Â¦* . J*.ck M.unroe'3 corps of sparring part
pers spent a tempestuous afternoon
ywterday in the miner's gymnasium at
the ocean beach. As Monday will be
the "last day on which hard work will
be indulged, all in the camp are putting
focth fxtra efforts before the time limit
â¬ipires.
. Munroe let out a link In his hitting
"poyvers yesterday and floored all his
boxing partners. Andy Gallagher took
.a straight right-hand blow on the neck
eijd went down in a heap as though
struck- by electricity. He recovered in a
moment only to go down a second time
frpm a blow on the head.
,/ Twin Sullivan and Harry Chester
.came in for their share of trouble also,
taking some severe blows.
â¢ iCid McCoy was an absentee yester
day. On the previous day while box
ing with Munroe he made a bluff as if
\<y pick something off the floor, and
then suddenly swung his right over at
e MAinroe's head. The latter's guard was
up before the blow reached its mark
and McCoy struck the miners arm with
his wrist. This prevented him from
wbrking, but he will be out again to
day.
McCoy's handiwork can be seen in all
Munroe's tactics. His latest idea is to
keep Jack blocking a lot and leading
.but seldom. Some of the sparring part
ners did not know this, and they have
l>een trying their hardest to beat down
hi? guard, without success. Occasion
ally Munroe quits the defensive tactics
Â«nd becomes the aggressor. Then the
fur flies.
* After next Monday Munroe's work
wiU be of the lightest possible charac
ter. He will walk enough to keep him
i^tlf in health, but there will be no se
vere sprinting nor straining of any
kind. Boxing will be cut out so that no
' injury may come to the hands â a fight
-.!'!= most valuable asset.
*_The bettors commenced to nibble yes
tPi*day at the proposition as to the
Vro'-Jable number of rounds the fight
wotHd' last. The admirers of Jeffries
tame out with a proposition of even
money that the champion will win in
â¢side of twelve rounds. It is expected
ih* 1 camber of rounds will be cut down
until the Jeffries men will be betting
that he will win in ten or . perhaps
less. Owing to the bad feelins that Jef
fries *is known to bear toward Munye
=an4 his advisers the general impres
sion is that the fight will be a short and
â¢a .nVerry orre. TVith two such hard hit
twg iti rartion one blow will practically
fnd the battle â when either man lands
It J^flfrics . is still a 4 to 10 choice in
.The betting.
c The sale of seats will reopen this
ir.nrning at 10 o'clock at Harry Cor
bcftCfs.* Many persons who secured seats
ivtfort the fight was postponed have
never .had tht-m redeemed. The advance
reservations are said to be good.

The Tigers kept cutting down the
lead, one by one, till they finally
created a deadlock in the fourth. AH
was peace and quietness then till the
gloomy eighth was at hand. Then it
burst. Lynch lined one at Irwin that
was too torrid to handle. Charley
threw the ball to first and Lynch tore
into secend on the bad throw. Goch
nauer made his initial error when he
threw the next one hit by Casey away
at first and so the winning run
landed.
Four fast double plays were made
and these cut a big figure in the runs
that did not come in. San Francisco
had a chance to break it up in the
ninth, but the hit was lacking. Van
Buren had beaten a bunt and Wooden

It's the proper caper In Tacoma to
capture ball games by a run. Mike
Fisher is trying to introduce the cus
tom into this town and so far he is
doing Quite well at Recreation Park.
Three In a row have gone to the horse
shoe kid and he Just nosed the natives
to It in the same old way. Yesterday
it was Tacoma 3, San Francisco 2.
"As long as you can win with one
run," says Mike, "what's" the use of
killing: your men running 'em over the
bases? I'm going to win the flag by
a run. believe me." That's good phil
osophy, but maybe some slugging ball
team will get to the Tigers soon and
break up their combination, which at
the present time is a wonder.
Although two of the slowest pitchers
in the league were working yesterday,
the game was fast and full of scrap.
San Francisco opened it with two and
Fisher took off his coat. It looked like
a cakewalk for Uncle, but after the
first rc/und his warriors were never
there, although they had chances as
usual.

was served in the club's pretty delft

"The Statics and Dynamics of
Household Economy," was the some
what formidable title of a talk by Mrs.
Jean Sinclalre, a visitor in Oakland
from Montreal, Canada.
The entire programme for the after
noon was as follows:

and the Oakland New Century Club," Mrs.
Robert Watt: Federation topic: History and
Landmarks, "the Landmarks of California and
Their Preservation." J. N. Knowland:

, "Cotton Hall at Monterey, where the
first convention was held and for the
preservation of which the last Legisla
ture appropriated $1500, is on the
league's list; so are all the old mis
sions, about nineteen in number."
;â¢ 3a alluding to the San Antonio mis
sion. Senator Knowland said: "It
looks as if it had just been deserted.
It is surrounded by. acres of ruins of
Indian huts and for miles about it are
to be seen the remains of old water
courses, for the padres were the pio
neer irrigationista of California. The
Landmarks League has expended $1300
in rebuilding the walls of the chapel.
During this work of repairing, the in
terest of the Indians was remarkable,
fully 150 of them volunteering a week's
labor toward repairing the old mis
sion where many of them had first re
ceived religious instruction. Their zeal
might well -be emulated by the citizens
of this State."
"In Northern California is an old
and interesting landmark of the State's
early historyâ old Fort Ross, in So
noma County. Xear by is the old
Greek chapel, the Governor's house and
two blockhouses, still in a fair state
of preservation. This landmark was
recently purchased by the league and
we hone to be able soon to restore it
as it was in 1S12.
"The league's next important move,"
continued the speaker, "was to repair
the old Custom-house at Monterey. It
was from this building that John
Drake first unfurled the flag of the
United States of America.
The beginning of activities at the
New Century Club this afternoon was
a brilliant event and augurs well for
the season's success. An air of com
fort and wellbeing always hovers over
this little club and its tone of seeming
prosperity was accentuated to-day by
the soft frou-frou of silken garments,
as scores of fashionably dressed
women took their places in the li
brary, which was, for the time being,
the reception hall. Joseph R. Know
land, Republican nominee for Con
gress and president of the Landmarks
League, gave an instructive and In
teresting talk on the landmarks of
California and their preservation.
The young legislator was at his best
to-day and never was audience more
attentive, as he told, brielly as pos
sible, how many landmarks had re
ceived the league's attention and
what had been done to preserve them.
Sutter's Fort in Sacramento, he said,
that mecca of pioneer travelers across
the continent, was the first to be re
habilitated, which was done at a cost
of considerably more than $20,000, that
sum alone being expended for the land
surrounding the old fort.
"Attention was next directed," said
Senator Knowland, "to the point where
Marshall first discovered gold, a dis
covery that made its mark on the his
tory of the world's currency. A fitting
monument now stands near the old
Sutter's mill, in El Dorado County.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

The Republican Congressional Com
mittee has organized for the campaign
that J. R. Knowland will now make.
George W. Reed was chosen chairman,
Dr. C. L. Tisdale of Alameda vice
chairman and Everett J. Brown secre
tary. Reed will manage the campaign.
The West Oakland Republican Club
has been formed by a large number of
colored voters in that section. The offi
cers ar*Â»: President. W. H. Dodson; vice
president, R. C. Coleman; secretary,
Henry Jones; treasurer, O. F. Palmer;
sergeant at arms, C. E. Broadus.
A matter of State interest that is in
cidental to the nomination of a legisla
tive ticket from this county is that Ala
meda County will offer one candidate
for President pro torn, of the Senate
and two candidates for the Speakership
of tho Assembly.
This is what F. W. Leavitt, holdover
Senator from the Sixteenth District,
said: "I am a candidate for President
pro tent of the Senate, and I am go
lns to make every effort that I can to
(jet it. The only other candidate that
1 know of is Senator Pendleton of Los
Angeles. I have no comments to make
except that I am going to win if I
can."
This is what Phil I.I. who ex
pects to be re-elected in the Forty
eigrhth District, said: "I have been told
that I could command enough support
to secure ray election as Speaker of the
Assembly, and I will probably stand
for that place."
J. A. Bliss, who has served four terms
in the Assembly, said: "I- have served
about as long in the Assembly as any
one, and it has been suggested to me
that this should entitle me. to some
recognition."
It is probable that City Auditor A. H.
Breed >\ ill be chairman of the conven
tion. The work of nominating the can*
deflates will be purely formal, and the
ticket that the Republicans will offer to
the voters of Alameda County will be
as follows:
State Isenators â Thirteenth District, J. G.
Hatios Jr.; Fourteenth District tunexpired
term cf J. Jl. Knowland*. \V. M. Simpson;
Fifteenth District, Q. R. Lukens.
AtirmMrmrn mrty rtriti District. E. K.
ttrowbridge of HaywarJs; Forty-seventh Dis
trict. J.CItii Bates of Alam-da: Forty-eighth
IMetrict. Fbll M. Walsh of Oakland: Forty

District. J. A. B!l*s of Oakland; Fifty-first
I'istrlct, R. H. E. E*pey of East Oakland;
Fifty-eecond District. W. H. Waste of Berke-
Supervtsorsâ First District, C. F. Hornex of
OntentUe: Fourth District, li. D. Rowe of
East Oattand; Fifth Dtstrict. John Mitchell
of Oakland.
The Republican County Convention,
uhich will meet to-morrow at Germa
nia Hall, will be one of those harmony
gatherinps that have characterized the
Republican party of Alameda County
for some time. There will be no con
tests and the convention will be short
and sweet. The only contests that ex
isted in the party were settled at the
primary election last week, and these
have long since been buried and forgot
ten.

struct the bringing of the- snit against
the secretary because Woodward and
the other directors would not hear to
such an. action.
The complaint sets forth that
Woodward became secretary - of the
company March 19, 1902, was in the
confidence of the corporation and was
authorized by Balliet to open his mail,
sign money orders and receipt for
money received- in- BallieFs name. It
is charged that Woodward sold shares
and receipted for about $170,000 re
ceived .for stock sold., Out of this
sum he paid his traveling expenses to
Baker City, Or., paid for labor, fuel,
timber, machinery and other expenses
of the mine and paid his traveling ex
penses to Des Moines, Iowa, together
with the expenses of his wife on the
trip. It is stated that she was an in
valid and was quartered in a hospital
here at a great expense:
Woodward, it is charged, has only
accounted for the expenditure of about
$100,000 for the mine and $10,000 for
advertising, which leaves $60,000 yet
to be accounted for. It is to find what
has become of the latter amount that
the suit for accounting is brought.

The unsuspecting stranger consented,
and when they reached Filbert street.

They relieved him of his gold watch
and chain, but failed to get $150 in gold

The speechmakers took the ground
that the repeal of the anti-compulsory
vaccination law should be sought by all
honorable means. Cleanliness of habi
tations, streets and sewers is a muclÂ»
more expedient way of crushing out
smallpox than with virus, so uncertain
in Its results, with its likelihood to
cause death or "permanent injury and
its general inefficiency. The speakers
were Hugh Craig. John R. Jones, C.

A judgment which the musty courts
of Philadelphia were unkind enough
to give against Edna Wallace Hopper,
actress, singer and heiress, is bound to
be satisfied if the judgment creditors
can reach her. They have discovered
that she does not live in California
ahd have also found that her perma
nent address is 226 West Forty-fifth
street, New York. Upon this showing
the plaintiffs yesterday secured dn or
der for the publication of summons
calling upon her to answer the suit
on the judgment of this court. In the
meantime the creditors have attached
the lady's interest in 315 acres of land
in Alameda County belonging to the
residuary estate of her mother, Jose

case are George and Robert Barrie of
Philadelphia, doing business as George

When the navy transport Solace,
Commander J. H. Eull in charge,
homeward bound from Manila, left
Honolulu she was under orders, after
getting within 200 miles from this
port, to make hourly announcements
with her wireless telegraph of her ap
proach. At Mare Island, on Yerba
Buena and at Point Reyes for the Ia3t
three days operators have listened for
the tapping in of some messaga from
the approaching vessel. The first click
came .-it 10 o'clock yesterday morning
and at 1 o'clock intelligible communi
cation was established and a message
received simultaneously at the three
lecal stations telling the listeners in
the dots and dashes of the Morse
alphabet that the Solace was seventy
seven miles to the westward.
She reached port last night too late
to pass quarantine, but long before she
appeared above the horizon it was
known that all was well with her.
The Solace left Cavite July 23 and
Guam July 29. She has only three
passengers: Lieutenant Commander L.
D. Miner. W. L.. Manning and Mrs. H.
O. Bissett,
The navy transport reached Hono
lulu August 10 and there as here an
nounced her approach by wireless.
She is fitted with the Slaby-Arco sys
tem, which is in charge of R. S.
White.
The Solace spoke and relieved the
distress of the ship Brodick Castle
August 5, about 1160 miles west of
Honolulu. The sailing vessel was
bound from Iquique for the Hawaiian
port and was far out of her course
when the Solace sighted her. Her
chronometers were out of order and
she was short of provisions. Com
mander Bull supplied the Brodick
Castle with food and gave Captain
Olaf Olsen his position and a chro
nometer.
The Solace left Honolulu August 12.

' Ti>.r executive committee has a com
plete roster of all visiting command
eries'and parties coming in groups, al
phabetically â -anged so that Sir
Knights c?n be located either by look
ing for the commander}' or looking
thr<">uÂ£h the alphabetical list of hotels
and" bo^rdin^-houses, each of which is
credited v.ith the number of guests it
â¢accommodates, and their designation.
A large number of local Sir Knights
h;is "olurteered to serve on the infor
fnatfon committee, and will work in
details, stationed at the principal head
cjuartors. hotels and halls, as well as
et prominent points along Market
ftrr-ftt. ready to give information to all
visitors. The members of the commit
tee will wear a distinctive badge by
which strangers v. ill easily recognize
them and ask information if they de
t-irr. .
The representatives of the Great Pri
ory of England and Wales will leave
Chicago on August 21 in a special car.
.They, will be accompanied by General
John Corson Smith, chairman of the
committee on foreign relations of the
Â¦TJrand. Encampment. The party will
. incjude: Right Honorable Earl of Eu
fton; Charles F. Matier. the great Vice
-<'har.cellpr: Rev. C. E. L. Wright,
Grand Prelate: A. F. Wodiwiss,
Knicht Commander of the Temple; Sir
'A. J. Thomas and Sir Thomas Fraser.
â¢ The .system for registration and in
formation inaugurated by the Knights
-Templar for conclave week is as com
plete and perfect as human ingenuity
can. devise. A committee has been or
'panized. with Joseph M. Cummlng as
. chairman, to assume charge of the bu
reau. The committee will work in two
divisions. One division will take com
p'.etc charge of registering visiting Sir
-Knights upon arrival in this city and
.keep track of thÂ»Mr local addresses, es
..^>ially should any of them change
Â¦.tfreir quarters during their sojourn, or
tjgo out of town for a time. A complete
card, index is now being prepared in
alphabetical order so that the name
:ar.d address of every visiting Sir
â¢â¢Knight can be found at a moment's
.notice. The 15.000 Sir Knights already
, located will be entered on the cards be
fore arrival. Changes can be easily
.madÂ° if wanted. Blank cards will be
on the incoming trains, at
ths depots and at the hotels, to be fill
.cd out. collected and sent to the office
to be -fikd.
The project of illuminating Union
fauaxe for the conclave of the Knights
Teraplar will not be abandoned. While
the square will not be eo brilliantly
bathed in light as at first purposed,
there will be enough incandescents
rtrung through It to make ft bright
as daylight.
The original notion was to devote $28,
000 to. this purpose, but the committee
oh decorations found that it could not
afford anything near that amount, and
It was about to be given up. But Emi
nent Sir John Fraser, chairman of the
committee, came to the rescue. He said
that if the committee would devote
$2000 to the project the St. Francis
Hotel management and others whose
property fronted on the square would
furnish enough in addition to make a
creditable display.
Prancing black horses are in demand
for the grand parade of Sir Knights.
to be held on the second day of the
conclave. Over 1000 of them, the pick
cf California equines, have been se
eured. They will come from Oakland.
Alarrreda. San Jose, Sacramento and
Stockton and other places in Santa
Clara, Marin. Sonoma, Xapa, Solano.
Contra Costa and San Mateo counties.
The best stock farms of the State will
be levied upon for steeds of somber
hue.
- Among the commanderies who will
appear mounted are California Com
piandery. the De Witt Clinton Com
rr.andery of Virginia City and Chasseur
.Commander}' of Philadelphia. The
mounted division of the parade is ex
pected to prove its most attractive fea
ture.
The other victim .was A. Vargo, a
street railway laborer,, living at Second
and Washington streets," Oakland.' He
told the officers,, that while he was
passing Montgomery - avenue and
Broadway a .young- man about 21
years of age met him and ordered him
to throw up his hands. â¢'. He did so and
the robber went through his pockets,
taking a silver watch. Because
Vargo had no money the robber struck
him on the face. After warning Vargo
not to make an' outcry, the robber dis
appeared. The .policemen say that
both Peters arid Vargo were under the
influence of liquor. . . ; .
Two men within a few minutes of
each^ other notified Policemen Roed
iger and Morton early yesterday morn
ing that they had been the victims of
footpads. '
Harry Peters, an old man, who ar
rived in the city on morning
frdm -Niles, was one of the vic
tims. He told the officers that he had
been drinking in a saloon on the Ba^-.
bary Coast and met three youths,
from 18 to 20 years of age. One of
them he met at the Tremont House and
paid his board bill for two days. They
left the ea loon and they walked him
along. Sansome street till they reached
a lumber yard at Lombard street.
There they .knocked him down by
striking him on. the face and took a
watch , and chain- and ,?37 from him.
His face was bruised and some of his
teeth were knocked- out.

San Francisco must accept responsibility for the re
markable condition of being forced to turn away from
the public schools children seeking admission. When
the municipality is too poor to teach its young or too
negligent of its manifest obligation to the people within
its limits, the. time, has come for a reform of methods,
immediate . and radical. Whether it be poverty, mis
management or both, a remedy should be forthcoming,
and every child in. San Francisco seeking instruction, or
entitled to it, should be enrolled in the public schools.
When Lincoln was inaugurated the

says the Chicago News, that impressed
those who saw it. The President-elect
came forward on the platform pre
pared at the east front of the Capitol,
with his natural awkwardness in
creased by the momentous circum
stances of the occasion and by a gor
geous wardrobe in which it was evi
dent he felt exceedingly uncomfort
able. The stiff dress coat, waistcoat
and pantaloons of black broadcloth
were enough of themselves to disturb
his mental and physical equanimity,
but to these were added other incum
brances in the shape of a brand-new
silk hat and a ponderous goldheaded
cane.
The cane he managed to put away
in a corner, but the disposition of the
hat perplexed him greatly. It was too
good to throw away, : too fine, as he

When William Rockefeller had ap
pendicitis Dr. McBirney was called in
to perform the necessary operation,
says the New York Times.
After his recovery Mr. Rockefeller
received the doctor's bill in due course,
and drawing a check went to pay the
account In person. In the conversation
which followed appendicitis was natur
ally their main theme.
"You told me," said Mr. Rockefeller,
"while I was sick, doctor, that every
body in the world had a vermiform ap
pendix."
"With a few exceptions I believe that
to be the case," answered the doctor.
"And, that, sooner or later," pursued
the oil magnate, "every one would have
to be operated on, either to cure or pre
vent the disease."
"That is the generally recognized
opinion among the medical fraternity,"
was the answer.
"Well," said Mr. Rockefeller, rising,
"if you will pardon my saying so, it
seems to me that you have a better
thing of it than has the Standard Oil
Company."
Better Than Oil.

Trombetti was burn of poor parents,
in Bologna, but he was sent to echool
nnd allowed to follow his bent until
the death of his father, which took
place when he was about 14 years old.
Then came days of great distress when
there was often little or nothing to
cat and the little brothers and sisters
cried for bread. His mother, who seems
to have been 'a woman of discernment
and energy, allowed him to remain at
school, however, encouraging him with
his studies, but ways and means be
came more and more narrow, the chil
dren grew larger and hungrier and the
neighbors frankly called her a fool for
having "a great boy idle at home."
Bo she nermitted her own instincts to
be overruled and apprenticed him to
a barber. Fortunately nature in this
case could not be suppressed and the
boy 6pent every moment which he
could snatch from his razors and
brushes on his books.
Up to this time he had never studied
any other tongue than his own and it
was a. mere accident which revealed
to him his marvelous gift and caused
him to make the acquisition of foreign
languages his life work. He got hold
of a German grammar, bought because
It only cost a few cents and "looked
queer." With this he made himself
master of the language as even few
Germans are. It was the same thing
with English and French; two more
grammars fell in hJs way and a few
months later be had acquired both
these languages.
With Latin it was different. He
picked up a book which he was told
was Latin and although he could make
little of it. it was sufficiently like Ital
ian to reuse his curiosity and he gave
â¢his mother no peace until she took
him to the priest to beg him to teach
the lad Latin. The. good man was de
lighted, thinking that the little Troni
betti wished to become a priest, but
the connection did not last long, as the
petent judges have declared, knows
more languages than any other man in
the world. Fame has come to him as
suddenly as it did to Byron, for al
though he is a perfect encyclopedia of
polyglot learning, he was unknown
even in his own land until recently,
when he wrote a book entitled "Con
nections Between the Languages of the
Old World"' and sent it to the Italian
Academy of Sciences to compete- for
the special prize offered by that body
of wise men. The next day all Europe
was talking of the^fauthor and lauding
him to the skies. The work showed
such extraordinary eruditic-n that stu
fients were amazed at it and Italians
were rather ashamed that such a per
aon should have lived so long in their
midst without being discovered earlier.
It is said that there is not a spoken
language or dialect of which Trom
betti has not at least the rudiments â
and he has never been out of Italy and
is only 3S years old!
Speak of Cardinal Mezzofanti! He
was an idiÂ«,-t beside the new wonder;
he spoke SO languages, while Trombetti
is said to know 400 of the native dia
lects of .North and South America
alone. Even if this is an exaggera
tion he may be safely said to know
vastly more about them than any other
one man ever did know.

$21,000 in counterfeit money during
the year. The falling off in counter

He walked down Montgomery street

denly dodged into the recess of the
alley and whirled about.

as ho grasped the head of his cane for
a straight blow from the shoulder.
"Tinkle-tinkle-tankle," answered
the bells from right behind him.
"Pickles" whirled again and as the
skirt of his overcoat struck the build

such as" no church steeple could send

. This reform, for which so much may be said and for
which so much more may be done by the intelligent and
vigorous co-operation of the best elements of the city,
is that involved in the organization of the parental school
by the Board of Education. The purpose of this school
is to gather in the waifs and derelicts of childhood, to
draw them away from surroundings that make babyhood
a tragedy of ominous and terrifying potentialities, to
train and educate young minds to a realisation that life
is not all labor or crime or disease of the mind no less
than of the body.
No better cause suggests itself to the consideration
and energies of public spirited citizens. Something more
than the regeneration of the naturally deficient is con
templated. Ever}' child taken from an environment of
mental, moral or physical ill-health is a missionary
whose unconscious efforts are making for the destruction
of the verj' conditions that exist in San Francisco as a
dangerous menace to its progress, its prosperity and, if
we must look to the material and utilitarian, its wealth.
Every child that is removed from the cannery or the
factory, from the drudgery, disease and degradation of
child labor, is an agent that goes back to its poor home
to work unknowingly but successfully a revolution in
districts least amenable to reforms. Every child that is
dragged from the slums to the parental school, from the
moral filth and contamination of minds older in disease,
is a pioneer to prove the efficacy of the teacher's greatest
accomplishment â unconscious tuition.
If the officers to whom has been delegated the vital
duty of making effective the parental school could do
no more. than what they accomplished a few days since
when their inquiry led them to a cannery owned and
operated by Chinese in this city, the purpose of this
splendid innovation of the Board of Education would
have been justified and its success would have been a
matter of intimate, personal concern to the general
community.
These investigators made the startling and sickening
discovery that many girls, not one of them fourteen
years of age, were drudging in child labor as the
employes of Chinamen in a Chinese cannery. The
disclosure is creditable neither to our humanity nor to
our boasted civilization. Child life in any community
should be more precious th?ri for such a use of its ca
pacities or for such a stifling handicap to its prospects.
These children will bi removed from their employ
ment. The power of the Juvtnile Court will be invoked
if necessary to enroll them in the parental school, and
disinfection of a moral sore spot will have begun in San
Francisco. It is by such work as this that the parental
school of San Francisco is recommending itself to the
good will and support of citizens. Laws that are upon
our statute books, but out of our minds either in recog
nition or enforcement, are being revived and made prac
tical in winning a necessary reform.
Employers that have no right here or elsewhere to
prostitute child life to small gain are being taught the
lesson that neither discretion nor humanity has been
powerful enough to impose. Children that face inevitably
lives useless to themselves nnd dangerous to their neigh
bors are escaping a wretched destiny to be set on the
right road to. a healthful carceer. Such a reform is good
to contemplate and better to demand, even if wider and
more powerful agencies of government are necessary to
make the demand one that must not be refused.
IN the contemplation or discussion of affairs that force
and command public attention by the noisy and in
sistent presentation of their claims San Francisco is
apparently giving inadequate consideration to a reform
that has been quietly inaugurated, is pursuing its course
admirably to the completion of splendid results, and must
win sooner or later the heartiest commendation of those
elements of the community that labor in the pitiable
cause of classes that by the operation of unfortunate
conditions are least able to protect themselves.

Major W. E. Graybill. corps of en
gineers. United States army, has
brought to the attention of the light
house board at Washington a case <">f
devotion to duty that is full of pathos,
and the board is now considering the
question of appointing Mrs. McCall. the
heroine of the story, a lighthouse keep
er as a reward for her conduct.
Mrs. McCall's husband. Daniel McCall.
was the keener of the light on Cat Isl
and, off the Mississippi coast, a remote
spot and seldom visited. A few weeks
ago Mrs. McCall found her husband's
body on the boat wharf. She tried to
carry It into the house, but was unable
to do so. Night came on. and realizing
that the light must be started she un
dertook to do so. It is a revolving light.
After the match had been applied and
the flame shone out on the waters Mrs.
McCall found that the machinery for
turning the big lamp would not work.
Knowing the importance of making it
revolve, she endeavored to keep it go
ing by the use of her own strength.
This she did all night, and on the fol
lowing night also, with her husband's
body lying on the wharf near by. On
the third day her signal of distress was
seen and assistance came.

Reports tell as that Joe Jefferson, the veteran and well
beloved American actor, is fast approaching the sleep
that knows no awakening. And when the kindly eyes
of the old man, who has so" endeared himself to the
world of theatergoers, have closed forever a figure with
out parallel in the affections of the American public
will have gone. Whatever may be said of other great
actors of the republic, Jefferson has been closer and
more dearly held than all of them.
thought, to rest upon the rough boards,
so, for a minute at least, poor Lincoln
stood there in the gaze of assembled
thousands, grasping the hat desper
ately and seeking in vain for a safe
place to deposit it. Douglas, who sat
immediately in the rear, saw the em
barrassment of his rival and, rising,
took the shining beaver from its sorely
bothered owner and held it during the
delivery of the inaugural address.
Probably had Stephen A. Douglas
been told, five years before, that he
was destined to hold the hat of Abra

appearing for the first time as Presi

known as "Pickles" because of the
fact that his name instantly recalls
the fifty-seven varieties of table rel
ishes we read about in the streetcars.
"Pickles" Is somewhat deaf and there
by hangs this tale.
Not long ago the gentleman in ques
tion found that the hot afternoon sun
made the carrying of an overcoat a
burden, so he stepped into a well
known downtown clothing establish
ment and asked of Blank, a fellow
Mason and proprietor of the place,
the privilege of leaving that cumber
some garment there until the after
noon fog made it again a necessity.
Blank gladly took the garment in
charge and after "Picklt-s" had left
the store he hied himself to a notion
store and bought a dozen of those lit
tle bells thnt Iadie3 are wont to tie
to the collars of npopletic pug dogs.
These, he instructed the tailor, should
be sewed inside the lining around the
bottom of "Pickles' " overcoat. It was
done. m

This proposition offends first the American sentimen
talist who is still treating his country as "an asylum for
the oppressed of all nations," and has no conception of the
exceedingly practical nature of the problem presented,
in the complete change in the character of immigration.
Next this reform touches the practical politician, the
man who will strive to get for his ticket the hundred thou
sand votes of the aliens who by fraud and crime have
possessed themselves of illegal naturalization papers. He
will make himself felt all the way up the line to Con
gress. He will make it appear that better laws on the
subject and the better safeguarding of American citizen
ship will offend our foreign born people already domesti
cated here. The answer to this is that if they are of
fended by measures to protect the liberties and free in
stitutions which they come here to enjoy they ougbl
never to have been permitted to come, and the sooner
we keep others out like them the better for the country.
No deserving alien born citizen will object to a proper
reform. Such a man has at heart the interests of his
adopted country. It has been kind to him. Here he has
enjoyed larger opportunity and perfect liberty, and the
only way to perpetuate both is by properly safeguarding
the political institutions that make them possible. He
will sec. and readily admit that those institutions cannot
long survive the effect of fraudulent citizenship and il
legal votes. We are of opinion that the member of Con
gress who will give to this matter wise and judicious
attention will secure enduring fame as a benefactor of
his country.
THE startling discovery that in and around New
York City are aliens to the number of 100,000 who
hold fraudulent naturalization papers should rouse
our people to the exceeding need of complete revision of
our immigration laws. Soon after these frauds were dis
closed the Atlantic liners put down the steerage fare
from Europe to the small sum of $8 75. This means
that the material out of which fraudulent citizens and
illegal voters are made is to be largely increased. The
evidence already in the possession of the officers shows
that there are enough of these to probably hold the bal
ance of power in a close Presidential election.
They are grouped in and around New York City, fo
cused upon the location where our political battles are
most intense, and we run the risk of having the posses
sion of the Presidency decided by non-English speaking
aliens, who are not legally citizens. The prospect is far
from pleasing, and the situation should admonish our
legislators of the need of better protection against the
possibilities of this enormous foreign immigration. No
difficulty is found in getting legislation to exclude the
Chinese, for they have no vote. Indeed; it may be said
to be a merit in them that, no matter what frauds they
may practice to get into the country, they cannot legally
of illegally become voters after they get here-
Serious as considerable violations of the Chinese ex
clusion law may be, they seem to lose importance in
the presence of wholesale violations of our naturaliza
tion laws, by which immense numbers of aliens, equal
to the Chinese in ignorance of our country and govern
ment, and inferior to them in good order, get the power
to control the government itself. Some one must take
the responsibility of making such a situation less possi
ble. Time was that we wanted immigration: It was our
proper national policy to encourage it. To that end we
forced expatriation treaties with the governments oÂ£
Europe, and we put the period of probation for natural
ized citizens at five years. For a long time the majority
of immigrants who came sought a new home here be
cause of their knowledge of our institutions and their
intelligent attachment to our form of government.
They were a wholesome addition to our population.
They rapidly assimilated and made good Americans, and
our composite blood still shows the physical prepotency
they brought with them. Their motive in coming was
not entirely material. It had a strong infusion of senti
mental, attachment to liberty, regulated by law. Their
thrift and industry readily took advantage of our broader
opportunities for the betterment of their fortunes, and
they contributed largely to the national wealth. But in
three-quarters of a century we drained Europe of that
element. It was the moral and physical health of the
Old World, and was a valued addition to the vigor of this
republic. While it was coming, in response to our invi
tation, we acquired certain sentimental ideas about immi
grants which grossly misfit the hordes that are pouring
in now at the rate of nearly a million a year, and that
have so little respect for our institutions that they imme
diately proceed to violate our laws and sophisticate our
citizenship.
The old style immigrants looked upon our laws and
institutions with reverence and held them too sacred to
be trifled with. A large percentage of those who come
now have no respect for our laws and institutions, and
many of them are at heart the enemies of all government
and of all law. The issue is serious. The immigration
laws should be revised. We should dictate the number
of each 'nationality that may come in a year, and we
s-hould seriously and sternly purge that number of all
undesirable individuals.
pupil soon outdistanced the master,
so much so that the priest thought
there was something: uncanny In such
cleverness and was rather relieved
when his duties were over. Persian
came next, followed by Arabic and
Greek, and so onâ dead and living lan
guages, tlialects, variations of all kinds
became to him as daily food, until
there are few more left for him to
learn.
Trombettl says that he has been par
ticularly fortunate in always getting
hold of simple and easy books with
which to begin the study of a new lan
guage. This was due to mere chance,
as he always had to take what came
his way, not being able to pick and
choose. He has never possessed more
than one dictionary â a present from
one of his schoolmasters â and even that
he never used. "I have," he says,
"written books in both German and
French, but absolutely without a dic
tionary."
His career as a barber ceased after
a year or two, as some eminent men of \
letters, learning of his wonderful gift, !
induced the municipality of Bologna to i
allow him J120 yearly that he might
devote himself exclusively to his stud
ies. With this income he felt so rich
that he Bpent nearly all of it on books,
and was continually in trouble to find
money to buy food and clothes. For all
bis extraordinary learning Trombetti
was, after all, a mere man, and lost
no time in falling in love. When he
became professor of languages in a
public echool, at a few hundred dollars
a year, he took the maiden of his
choice to wife, and has now six children
to rejoice in his good fortune, as the
Government has decided to find him a
good post where his talents shall have
full scope.
This gifted man has never known
what it is not to be hard up. With a
home to maintain and a wife and six
children to clothe and feed, every cent
was required and had to be accounted
for, so that he had to resort to great
stratagems to find the money to buy
books and could afford only the cheap
est editions. On one occasion he was
called to a near town to superintend
some examinations, for which he was
allowed SO cents for carriage hire. He
walked, bought a book for which he
had longed many weary months, went
home and went to bed, where he stayed
two weeks, having caught cold during
his long walk, and paid the doctor â
$3! This was not all. The $3 were to
have bought him new shoes and a hat.
so he was obliged to wear his old ones
six months longer. Whenever he came
home particularly shame-faced and
with a propitiatory gift for his wife,
she always knew what it meant. "Al
fredo," she would say, pointing her fin
ger at him, "let me see it." Then from
under his coat he would produce a new
book, but his delight in his new treasure
was so sincere, and even infantile, that
she never scolded him, although it
meant fresh economies for her in a
house where all was economy.
Although so much attention is now
being paid him. Professor Trombettl
is in no wise affected by it: he is as
Fimple as ever and declares that he has
no intention of changing his mode of
life. After gaining the prize of $2000
from the Academy of Sciences he was
received by the King. The evening be
fore that event he was with some
friends, when the conversation turned
on what he would wear the next day.
The professor allowed them to discuss
the matter for some time and then said
quietly, "But I am going as I now am."
"Never," they all cried. "But I am,"
he insisted. "I have never had a frock
ccat on in my life; why should I begin
now? No, indeed! I have other uses
for my money. I have seen a lovely
book," etc. In fact, he went to the
palace in tweed jacket and trousers,
his only concession to convention be
ing a black tie. which he wore â because
it was the only one he possessed.
Professor Trombetti has announced
his intention of going to America next
year to study the Indian dialects, as,
though he knows so much more about
them than anybody else, he considers
that he doe.s not yet know them pro
found^v enough. "1 shall write my book
in English," he says, "and, of course,
I want It to be perfect."

Injured In Elevator.
Possible danger to a three-year-old
child and the mother's natural anx
iety for its safety caused an accident
which has resulted in a suit for $5764
damages against the Langham Hotel
Company and Henningr Thode, owner
of nearly all of the stock therein. The
action was begun yesterday by Earl
R. Ostrander and his wife, Agnes. On
May 30 last they were occupying a
room on the fourth floor of the hotel
and the father, mother and babe en
tered the elevator to be carried to
their floor. Another passenger was
W. J. Packard. He got off at the sec
ond floor and the elevator boy, it is
said, did not close the door. The "lift"
started suddenly and the child was
thrown forward. The mother, fearinsr
that the youngBter would fail down
the shaft, started to recover him and
her head caught between the elevator
and the floor. Her clothes were cov
ered with blood and ruined, four of
her front teeth were knocked out and
her face was badly cut and brulned.

CALIIXmXIAXS AT FAIR.
I recommend that In all churches of the
dlocfse spiritual exercises be held during the
jubilee, accorfilng to the needs and capacity
of each, to prepare the faithful for the gain
ing of the indulgence and to renew and in
ciease their devotion to the mother of God.
This indulsence. to be gained only once,
may be applied by way of suffrage to the
souls in purgatory. Other indulgences are not
suspended during this jubilee.
Third â A worthy confession and communion,
Rev. and Dear Father: Our holy father.
Plus X. wishing to stir up the piety of the
faithful during this Jubilee year of the defini
tion of the immaculate conception, has grant
ed an extraordinary Jubilee to be gained in
dioceses outside the city of Rome within some
period of three months before the 8th of De
cember next, to be determined by the ordinary.
I therefore do assign the three months from,
September 8 to December 7, inclusive, as the
time within which the indulgence of the
Jubilee may be gained in this archdiocese on
the fulfilling of the following conditions laid
down by the Holy See:
First â Three visits to the cathedral church
for those living within the city of San Fran
cisco. Thoee living outsid* the city limits
may make these visits to the parish church.
During these visits the faithful must pray
some time for the liberty and expansion of
the Catholic churclj and the apostolic see; the
conversion of those In error; for the concord
of Christian governments and the peace and
unity of the faithful, and also for the holy
father's intention.
Second â A fast once on strictly lenten fare.
In accordance with an encyclical of
Pope Pius X the jubilee year of the
definition of the immaculate concep
tion will be appropriately observed by
Catholics of this city. Archbishop
Riordan, with this object in view, has
sent letters to the various parish
priests as follows:

Wheat (including tlour) exports for
the week ending August 18 aggregate
1,703,047 bushels, against 1.281,399 bush

Conservatism rules the buying move
ment, which while gaining in force at
some leading markets still lacks the
snap shown in former years at this
time. The lateness of the crop season
and reports of wheat and .cotton crop
deterioration, fortified \>y continued
wheat price advances and revisions of
quotations, notably in iron and steel
and cotton goods, breeds a feeling of
indecision. Cotton goods buying at first
hand is rather backward and does not
readily respond to reductions in
bleached goods. There is, however,
more jobbing in that line. Wool is firm
er on a quiet buying movement. Woolen
goods are in fair inquiry, but the higher
basis of cost is a bar to fuller develop
ment in this line. The scarcity of hides
has caused the shutdown of a number
of tanneries and the strength of the
market is shown in leather quotations
â half a cent per pound higher than a
month ago. A wholesale cut in steel
prices, particularly in wire nails, has
been announced, and existing pools in
some products, notably structural ma
terial and plates, are reported shaky.
Uncertainty as to how far the cuts will
go restricts buying.

NEW YORK. Aug. 19.â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say:
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.â R. G. Dmi &
Co.'s weekly review of trade to-mor
row will say:
Trade has been somewhat unsettled
by sensational events in the whefct
market and the lack of harmony be
tween labor and capital. It is becom
ing evident that the estimates of the
wheat crop must be reduced, although
other agricultural news is much bet
ter. In so far as the purchasing power
of the farmer is concerned, prices have
risen so sharply that any loss in quan
tity promises to be made up. Some
disappointment is felt by those who
counted on an early resumption of ac
tivity in building operations and other
industries. Otherwise, news of the
week has contained much^ of an en
couraging nature.
In several manufacturing lines there
is less Idle machinery and visiting re
tail buyers have stimulated Jobbing
trade, especially in dry goods and kin
dred lines. Railway earnings thus far
reported for the first week of August
show a small gain of 1.4 per cent as
compared with last year's figures,
whereas recent preceding weeks
showed more or less loss in comparison
with 1903.
Failures this week numbered 226 in
the United States, against 23S in 1903,
and 24 in Canada, compared with 8 a

Taking their cue from the crowds

The lands are hopelessly cut up and

DEVILS LAKE, N. D.. Aug. 19.â
The Government lottery of the Fort
Totten Indian reservation lands, the
registration for which closed at this
point and at Grand Forks to-day, has
been a dismal failure compared with
the Rosebud (S. D.) rattle, just com
pleted. While less than 15,000 regis
tered for the Fort Totten lands. 110,000
acres, more than 106,000 registered for
the Rosebud farms, 3S6.000 Â»cres. The
railroads thought they could keep their
rates up Jhe same as was done for
the other drawing, and the Devils
Lake gambling game, operated by Un
cle Sam, has been a fizzle.
The power of advertising has been
shown. The Rosebud was exploited in
every paper, because of President
Roosevelt's opposition to the opening
on the regular homestead plan. The
opening was told about in all languages.
The people rushed there in hordes. The
Fort Totten lands were opened with
little ceremony and little discussion.
When the Rosebud drew so magnetic
ally, the railroads, which had made
$1,500,000 in passenger fares, sat back
and waited for the people to go after
Fort Totten lands. They did not come.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
The Supervisors of Butte County
have proposed to raise the tax assess
ments on lands held for their values in
gold by the dredging process, through
the Sierra Lumber and the Eureka
Power companies, near Oroville, and
this has called out violent protest.
One proposed raise was the assess
ment on fourteen acres of dredger soil
from $2800 to $2 8,000 and another on
forty-three acres from $10,485 to $94,
500. A dredger miner, who formerly
objected to a public street being put
across his land, stating that it was
worth $3000 an acre, hurriedly ap
peared before the Supervisors, stating
that he was too high in his own fig
ures. The board, however, acting as
equalizers, pinned him down to his
first statement and the figures stand
as his assessment- The Eureka Power
Company protested against a raise in
its assessment of the Big Bend prop
erty, but the board calmly lifted it
from $25,000 to $50,000. It was pro
posed to raise the Sierra Lumber
Company's figures from $82,000 to
$150,000. but it was concluded that
a raise to $95,800 would be sufficient.
After four years of idleness the
Idaho-Maryland mine in Grass Valley
has resumed work and the old era
of good times and prosperity to that
locality has come again.
From Plumas County come reports
from the Five Bears mine In Genesee
Valley. There is added a ten-stamp
mill, in which the ore will be crushed
in a twenty-mesh, then reduced to
slimes in a Kinkead mill, after which
it will be elevated by a sand pump
into the agitating tanks of the cyan
ide plant- This solution and pulp will
be agitated and the values precipitated
by electricity upon cathodes instead of
in zinc boxes. The mine has a good
reserve of milling ore and crushing
will begin September 1.
Four companies are to handle the
product of the magnesite mine at Red
Mountain, south of Livermore. The
American Magnesite Company, of
which G. W. French of Chicago Is
president and H. C. Stillwell of Fruit
vale is vice president, will handle the
raw product, while the three sub
sidiary companies, which are to build
reduction works on tide water in Oak
land, will handle the manufacturing
enterprises. The magnesite will be
used for the making of firebrick for
furnaces of locomotives and other
boilers.
A dispatch from Auburn, Placer
County, says that the Channel Bend
mine on the American River, below
Michigan Bluff, was recently sold for
57 5,000. The new owners are San
Francisco men. who will immediately
resume operations there.
The reduction of bismuth from the
native ores by the new electro-chem
ical process will soon commence in
the Arroyo Seco at Garvanza, San
Bernardino County. This is in the na
ture of an experimental plant and is
to demonstrate the commercial feasi
bility of bismuth production by the
use of salts. The bismuth market is at
present coatrolled for the whole world
bv the manufacturers in Saxony, Ger
many. There are bismuth ores in
America, but no method has yet been
found to extract the chemical.
BUTTE'S ASSESSMENTS.
It Is said that tunneling will be begun next
week near the Sherwood property by Mr.
Cook of the Oak Hill mine.
That rich undeveloped cinnabar de
posits lie under the surface in the
northern and western portions' of So
noma County has long been believed by
mineral experts. The Press-Democrat
of Santa Rosa, speaking of the new
quicksilver discovery near Mark West
Springs, says:
The indications of cinnabar have been found
about three miles from the springs, where
there is a well denned ledge. There are also
signs of Quicksilver In Franz Valley wherÂ«Â»
the Sherwood ranch has been sold for $1<K>
an acre. The Taylor and Vance properties
in the same neighborhood have been sold and
the Clark place in Franx Valley will also be
bonded.
An "ideal hydraulic proposition" is
the old placer country contiguous to
the Grand Ronde River, in Oregon. The
headwaters of this stream spring from
an ancient river bed called Carson
channel, and it has been reported that
this particular place is rich in mineral
wealth. It is situated up in the Blue
Mountains, near La Grande. The Car
son channel is about 2000 feet wide, and
the bank of the pit carries values of 16
cents per yard. In the early '50's mil
lions were washed out of the Rogue and
Klamath rivers, and now, with hordes
of prospectors going into that region,
history will repeat itself. Chunks of
heavy quartz weighing nine pounds
each have been found above Brigg's
discovery, on Upper Thompson Creek,
and every day news of marvelously
rich finds comes into Grants Pass.
SOXOMAS RICH CINNABAR.
This ore body was tapped at the lowest
level several weeks ago. but not until yes
terday was the full extent of the find known.
This in probably the richest tir.d ever made
in Southern Nevada and It will doubtless stim
ulate mining throughout the Searchlight dis
trict. The Quartet mina is owned principal
ly in Boston, though a large amount of the
ftock is held In this city.
Reports frcm Furnace Creek, 'near Death
Valley, where a etampt-de of prospectors re
cently occurred, continue to be encouraging.
Captain Delamar of Salt Lake has just taken
a bond cf $150,0C0 on a property In this dis
trict and will expend a large Â»um of money
on development work.
Reports of an exceedingly rich
strike have come up from the 700-foot
level of the Quartet mine, at Search
light, New. and according to this in
formation a four-foot body of ore has
been opened up which returns values
of $1700 in gold per ton. Speaking of
the new find the Los Angeles Times
says:
Th? Democratic State Convention of
'T30 delegates will meet at Armory Hall.
. JTanta Cruz, at 2 o'clock p. m. next

Jihe organization of the convention.

It Â»eemfi almost absurd to have to make
this utterance. Senator Greenwell is too true

CHICAGO. Aug. 19.â Wheat sold at
fancy prices on the Board of Trade
again to-day, but buyers were so eager
to get possession of some of the cereal
that they showed no hesitancy In fol
lowing the market up to new high lev
els for the season. Wheat to be de
livered in May, next year, sold at
$1 14 7-S. Its closing price yesterday
was $1 69%. For deliveries before that
month corresponding advances were
made. May wheat closed at $1 14.
The distance between the close yes
terday and the high points to-day was
covered amid great speculative excite
mant and wild clamoring for the cereal
from speculators who entertain the be
lief that wheat is destined ultimately
to sell at much higher prices."'
Long before the opening traders were
prepared for a wild market. The
weather map showed general showers
In Manitoba and even heavier rains
in sections on this side of theboundary
line. That this condition would be Ini
mical to the harvesting of that portion
of the spring wheat not already so bad
ly damaged by rust a3 not to be worth
cutting went without saying and the
belief that wheat would sell higher be
came more unanimous than before.

OF GOLDEN GATE COFFEE
LÂ«Â«t week proved very popular. Here is another of equal household value that should meet with
even greater v popularity.
A TON OF THE FAMOUS
"BEE* Brand Ceylon Tea
Imported and Distributed by
Goldberg, Bowen Â®> Co.,
THE LEADING GROCERS
On THURSDAY, FRIDAY and SATURDAY of this week every one bringing a WANT
AD. for NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL will receive a full weight lead foil packet of this tea FREE.
"BEE" BRAND CEYLON TEA sells for 50c, 60c, 80c and $1.00 per pound.
Read what the importers and sellers of this high-grade tea have to say of it:
_ "In our judgment 'Bee' brand is the best quality Ceylon tea and the best value for the money.
We have imported it for ten years. Each importation (and they come four times a year) is
larger than the previous one. Ceylon Tea is picked by hand, but thereafter it is rolled and handled
entirely by machinery. This obviates the accumulation of perspiration by delicately scented
leaves. The far-seeing Englishman finds the commercial advantage of modern methods outweigh
its cost. (Signed), GOLDBERG, BOWEN & CO."
t Premium Given Thursday, Friday and Saturday to

Shaw Mill leave for Los Angeles on
the evening of September 6 and will
be the recipient of genuine Califor
nia hospitality during his stay here.
Leslie M. Shaw, Secretary of the
Treasury, is expected to arrive on the
right of September 2 or on the morn
ing of September 3, and Federal of
ficials are keenly awaiting hia com
ing.
There Is a tradition amone them
that Secretary Shaw has an unosten
tatious but rather startling habit of
happening around just about the time
of beginning work to see that "all
hands are on deck." They hope,
however, that they may have only
one day's experience, as September 3,
being a Saturday, will be a half holi
day. Sunday, a holiday, follows;
Monday will be Labor day, also a hol
iday, and on Tuesday the Knights
Templar will parade, and this may dÂ«
declared a holiday also.
They Will Be at Their Desks HaJf an
Hour Before Time on Sep
tember Third.

All kinds of deciduous fruits in email pack
ages were in free supply and generally weak,
as there was very little doing in the shipping
line and local trade was of a light jobbing
character, beins confined mainly to the filling
of small orders for ordinary routine require
ments. Some dealers were still quoting $1 50
per box for fine Gravensteln Apples, but there
was not enough business at that price to war
rant such a Quotation. The ruling price for
the general run of fancy apples was $1 25 per
box, and trade was rather quiet at that. Bart
lett Pears in wrappers were very weak and
over-rlpa â¢ stock, which was plentiful, waa
offering below the minimum quotation, but
found few buyers. Peaches developed an easier"
tone under increased supplies, and Plums,
Prunes and Figs continued to drag at un
steady rates. The canners were in the mar
ket again for Peaches and Pears, bat were
not buying very heavily and prices were regu
lated by the leading packers.' who pooled their
interests. For Freestone Peaches, $20@25 per
ton was Dald, while $30 was the rate estab
lished for the best Clingstones. Fresh arrivals
of Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons did a lit
tle better , but there was plenty of old stock
to be had at easy rates. Watermelons moved
vtry slowly and there were many cars lying
on tin- track waiting to be hauled. Grapes
were plentiful and continued to sell at a wide

were quiit and unchanged. Bananas were

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â The Liverpool market was firm
but not active, and futures were higher.
Paris futures were weak. Broomhall cabled
that, threshing returns in Northern France
were disappointing and that estimates on the
crop in that region were 25 per cent below
last year. According to Beerbohm, the
French crop will probably not exceed, if it
reach. 820.000,000. as compared with 365,
160,000 bushels last year.
Austria- Hungary has prohibited exports of
corn, barley and all foodstuffs. Broomhall
says that barley is the grain most exported,
about 15,000,000 busbela being shipped annu
ally. In view of the crop failure the Hun
garian Government has already bought 1.G00,-
Jjj^O bushels of foreign wheat. The Importance
uj. the shutting off of exports is seen in the
size of their corn crop last year, 128,000.000
bushels, and of barley 115,000,000 bushels. Ex
ports of corn from the Danublan countries
last year were 42,000,000 bushels.
Chicago v.-as again a wild market, rising
from $1 06% to (1 10% and closing at $1 09%,
a net gain for the day of 3%c.
Cutter & Moseley's wires from Chicago said:
"Manitoba is sending in increasing rust re
ports and rains all over the Northwest are
advancing the market. The northern Red
River Valley is seriously affected by black
rust. Fears of drought in the corn districts
have been dissipated by the rains."
The wires of E. F. Hutton & Co. said:
"Jones' report of the Manitoba crop is sen
sationally - threatening. Â» Snow, the statisti
cian, says that during a day's drive in Min
nesota thero was not 100 bushels of plump
Wheat, and that over an area at 300,000 acres
from Fergus Falls to Alexander, the failure'
was complete. The straw was Heavy,' but
there was not a pint of grain in the shock.
Practically none will be threshed. Mlnno- 1
apolis wired that reports from Manitoba were
worse." .
Portland wires to E. F. Hutton & Co. said
that the' Willamette "Valley millers are pay
ing llgSc premium to obtain immediate sup
plies. At the high prices East it has been
profitable to ship East, and about 500,000
bushels have been sent to Chicago, Minneapo
lis and Duluth during the past few days.
The Wheat and Flour markets are very stiff.
Wires to R. Brent Mitchell said that a party
of miller* back to Chicago fronT^the North- .
west makes the crop of the three States 100,
000,000 bushels, and that the opinion is that
Wheat will sell up to ?2.
In the San Francisco market futures were
2%o higher on the morning session, with
active trading. The big bulls took their
profits on the rise, but otherwise the trading
was of a scalping character. The cash grain
continued firm, but quotations were no higher.

The depression in Butter was very pronounced
yesterday and all but two or three houses
offered their goods at lower prices than those
heretofore quoted. Some offered their best
Humboldt creameries as low as 24c. Cards
have been out for a day or two offering the
best Marin makes at this figure. There is still
some extra fine Butter selling in a limited
way for special trade at the former prices,
but the amount is nqt sufficient to keep tha
market up to that quotation.
Eggs rule steady, with the demand and
supply about equal, though receipts made a
marked increase yesterday and one or two
houses reported more stock' on their floors
Cheese is still in large supply and un
changed.

northern points. Garnet Chiles .were offering
freely at sharply reduced rates but moved
slowly owing to the lack of demand for ship

CHICAGO. "Aug. 10. â From the start both
the public and professionals in the wheat trade
seemed imbued with bullish enthusiasm and
bought eagerly but wildly. Initial trades were
at advances of 1%Â« to 2o for September at
51 08 to $1 OSVj and 1%Â©1T*c to 2y t @2%c for
December at 51 00V4 and 51 O9Â»4. There ap
peared to be many causes for the higher mar
ket, though the most potent Of them did not
become operative until the session was well
ur.der way. There were rains in Manitoba and
the Northwestern States, which threatened
dire results in the fields spared by the black
rust, where harvesting is about to commence
or Is actually in progress. Cables were higher
and It was predicted that Texas millers would
soon be in the market for wheat. In spite
of these influences the bears gained control of
the early market and on heavy realizing sales
prices receded to $1 O7T6 for September and
$1 08% for December. Strongly contradictory
reports on rust in Manitoba appeared for a
time to create an uncertain feeling. With
cyclonic force and suddenness, however, a
reversion of feeling came and pessimism seemed
to seize upon all alike. The Northwest start
ed to buy. A message from a Minnesota point
was to the effect that not a pint of grain
wa s to be found in the shocks of many fields.
From that time on there were relapses, but
only momentary ones, and with each advance
a new high point was reached. September,
under the onslaught, was carried up to 51 10&
and December to 51 12&. There was heavy
selling at the top in the way of profit-taking
and values receded from the high point through
the weight of offerings. September sold back
to Jl 0S%, but began again its upward flight,
when the selllnz orders had been taken care
of. The close was strong at $1 09%. Decem
ber broke to 51 IOTA, but reacted and closed
at 51 ll*g. May was strong In the final trad
ing, closing at 51 14.
In the corn market September opened steady,
Sic lower to He higher at 54SÂ«4^c, but/sold
down to 53 Vic. rallied to 54V4c on bullish en
thusiasm borrowed from wheat and * declined
again to the closing figure. %o oft the bot
tom at 53%c. 'â¢':' â¢'Â¦'/Â¦Â¦".
In the oats market September opened a shade
to W(SVic higher, advanced with wheat and
closed easier at 34V4c.
Provisions started firm, presumably because
of better prospects for the corn crop. Packers
reported a good consumptive demand and the
tone for a time was helped by higher prices
for livestock. Support was lacking during the
last hour of trading, however, and values suf
fered. September pork closed 2V4Â®5c lower;
lard was off 6@7V4c and ribs were down

Maud Ryan's application for $10 a
month alimony pending the hearing of
her suit against Patrick Ryan, a clerk
in the Hlbernia Savings Bank, for di
vorce was denied by Judge Hunt. It
was shown that when the couple sep
arated last April he had agreed to pay
her $85 a month and had done so until
June. She represented that she could
not live on that amount and had in
curred debts of $130. The Judge said
that he would order the husband to
pay the $130, but would not require
more until the case Is tried week after
next. Mrs. Ryan's charge against the
bank clerk was cruelty and included
among other things his failure to pro
vide a wardrobe for their expected
child.
Judge Hunt yesterday heard another
installment in the serial divorce story
of Dina Smith against Andrew. He
denied her a divorce last Monday and
next day, she says, when she went
back to live with her husband, he re

wagon spoke. Judge Hunt said he be
lieved this part of the story, but he
was convinced that both sides had
been guilty of "rank perjury" and he
would not grant a divorce, but would
take the matter under submission and
probably change his order regarding
alimony.
The other side of the McCausland
story came out yesterday In the an

said that from February to May of
last year he did not work because he
was too sick, having been made so by
toiling night and da*- for his family
and he had given his wife about all of
his earnings. These she spent injudi
ciously. The girl Carrie Love, who
came to visit McCausland's aunt and
uncle, he had known from childhood
and merely tried to make her visit
pleasant: There was no cause for his
wife's jealousy. When he went to the
train to see Miss Love depart it was
in company with his aunt, who is 60
years old. He does not believe that the
letter which Mrs. McCausland opened,
from Miss Love, contained the things
she said it did, but he says she threat
ened to send a photographic copy of it
to the young woman's friends.

From Warsaw, Russia, comes a
declaration of war over the estate of
Charles Kornfeld, who died in this
city August 2, 1903, leaving property
appraised at $204,641. Kornfeld's
will, dated six weeks before his death,
named his widow, Virginia, and Annie
T. Smith, who was not a relative, aa
executrices. Most of the estate went
to the widow. Annie Smith was be
queathed $60,000 and the other lega
tees were Reuben H. Lloyd, Conrad
Haut and Ludwig Schumacher, be
sides two charitable institutions.
Yesterday Attorney Otto Irving TV:3Â«
filed a petition for the revocation of
the probate of the will on behalf of
Jcseph Guzik of Warsaw, a son of
Symcha Guzik, said to be a brother
of Kornfeld. Another brother, Fibusz
Guzik. is also living In Warsaw.
It is set forth in the petition that
Kornfeld was 80 years old at the time
of his death and had suffered for
twelve months from mental and physi
cal disorders, therefore it is said he
was not competent to make a will and
was not free from the influence of his
wife and Annie Smith. It is declared
that in his letters he promised to take
care of his nephew and brother In
Russia when he made a will.

cay-?:
Tbert la a -feelir.t here widely spread that
. The special committee from the bay
feities appointed to confer with the
Supervisors' Public Utilities Commit
tee relative to the acquisition of a
municipal water supply for San Fran
cisco and contiguous counties met yes
terday at the City Hall. There were
present Supervisors d'Ancona, Braun
hart and Finn, Mayor Olney and J. T.
Â¦Wallace of Oakland, J. E. Bennett of
TurJock and James Thomas and J. \V.
Jiichards of Modesto in unofficial ca
pacities and Joseph F. Forderer of
Alameda, who presided at the meet
ing.
Correspondence was read showing
that the Turlock irrigation board is
willing to meet in conference for the
purpose named, while the Modesto
board refuses to treat with the local
committee, stating that the board be
lieves that the present and future
needs of the irrigable lands along the
Tuolumne River require all the water
flowing therein or that can be stored.
Chairman Forderer said he did not
understand Modesto's opposition in
view of the fact that the Tuolumne
source has an available supply of
1S5.000.000 gallons of water daily and
Jt was only proposed to divert one
third of that amount to the bay cities.
RUSSIAN HEIRS WANT
PART OF BIG ESTATE
Committee From Bay Cities
V Discusses Municipal Sys
tem From Tuolumne. River
Â¦ Roncovieri claims that the" Super
visors "must" submit the amendments
in the case noted and for that reason
he is busy preparing his amendment
by petition to render the School De
partment independent of the jurisdic
tion of the Supervisors, so far as, the
city's share of the school appropria
tion is concerned.
'The Supervisors explain that the
regular election on November 8 was
selected . to submit amendments be
cause no provision has been made to
hold any special elections for the pur
pose. Roncovieri in answer to this
contention refers to a succeeding sec
tion of the constitution, .which leaves
the Supervisors no alternative when
the legal requirements relative to the
submission of charter amendments are
complied with. The section follows:
' Whenever 15 per cent ! of the qualified
voters of the city., shall petition the leeiala
tive authority thereof to submit any proposed
amendment or amendments to said charter
to the qualified . voters . thereof for approval
the legislative authority must submit the same.
SUPERVISORS EXPLAIX.
Roncovieri asserts that the two
years' limitation is specifically con
tained In the clause "May be amend
ed at intervals of not less than two
years by proposals therefor." which
he argues refers to the submission of
the amendments to the electors. On
the other hand the Supervisors con
tend that the limitation simply applies
to the ratification' of amendments by
the Legislature, which meets every
two years, and not to their submis
sion. Roncovieri says that the latter
construction would be. correct If there
was a comma between the words
"years" and "by," as the original text
of the section read before the con
stitution was amended.
The charter, so ratified, may be amended
at intervals of not less than two years by
proposals therefor, submitted by the legisla
tive authority of the city to the qualified elec
tors thereof at a eeneral or special election,
held at least forty days after the publica
tion of such proposals for twenty days In a
daily newspaper of general circulation in such
city, and ratified by a majority of the elec
tora votlnsr thereon and approved by the Leg
islature as herein provided for the approval
of the charter.
Section 8 of the constitution as
amended on November 4, 1902, upon
which Roncovieri bases his contention,
follows:
BASIS OF CONTENTION*.
Roncovieri declared yesterday that
the object of the Supervisors in fixing
upon the earlier date was to shut out
proposed amendments as the result of
a petition by 15 per cent of the elec
tors, notable among which is the one
now being prepared by Roncovieri de
signed to grant independent power to
the Board of Education to fix its bud
get of expenditures with a tax limita
tion of 12 cents for the purpose. Ron
covieri says that if the later date, as
required by the constitution, were
fixed as the date for the charter
amendment election the school amend
ment and others would have sufficient
time for the sixty days' publication
as required by law before being sub
mitted.
Alfred Roncovieri is of the opinion
that the Board of Supervisors in fix
ing upon November 8 next as the date
upon which proposed amendments to
the charter will be submitted to the
voters has ignored the plain provisions
of the constitution of the State of
California, which provides that char
ter amendments shall be submitted at
intervals of not less than two years.
In support of his contention Ron
covieri points out that the last charter
amendment election was held on De
cember 4, 1902, and according to the
constitution another election for the
purpose cannot be held until Decem
ber 4 next.

Mayor Olney contended that the
land owners along: the Merced, Stan
islaus and San Joaquin rivers had no
claims to the Tuolumne supply and
that the plan to store the water for
the use of the bay cities -would aid
Modesto and Turlock to get a larger
supply. A committee consisting of
Supervisor Braunhart and Mayor Ol
ney was appointed to draw up a no
tice explaining to the people the stand
taken and the claims made by the bay
cities in the matter of acquiring the
water supply from the Tuolumne.

Rose Cohen was charged with disturb

John Colemah, porter in a saloon at

cused of battery, the complaining.wit

claiming himself "a glood Clistlon boy,"
swore ..that without having / received
any provocation whatever, the defend
ant violently ejected him from the bar
room and kicked and cuffed him and
threw him with great force upon the
sidewalk. Offsetting the complaint,
however, was the testimony of several
Caucasian witnesses, who saw the Jap,
intoxicated and turbulent, enter . the
saloon and annoy the porter until the
latter turned and threw him out/ Case
dismissed by Judge Cabaniss.
The cowardly plea might have ob
tained Mr. Murphy's release if he had
abstained from mentioning that he had
not seen his family for three days and
that he was drunk all that time. Then
he was given ten days in jail, and the
Judge regretted that the law fails to
provide for the punishment of such
creatures as Murphy in some way that
does, not compel those dependent upon
them for support to share it.
"I have a wife and three children,"
said Henry Murphy, charged with
drunkenness, "and if I'm sent to jail
they're" sure *-' suffer." ,
"What a cowardly fellow you are,"
said' Judge Fritz, "to advance such a
plea as that."
That was the story told by the girl
to Judge Cabaniss and sharp question
ing failed to shake it. She was reluc
tant to return home and thus acknowl
edge dependency upon her parents, but
she had friends residing on Mission
street who would shelter her, she was
sure, until she obtained decent employ
ment. The Judge gave her some Grat
uitous advice, detailed an officer to
place her in the hands of her friends
and. fervently expressed hope that he
would never see her again.
Mabel Smith, eighteen years of age
and passing comely, quarreled with her
parents, who live at Berkeley, and
came to the big city to convince them
that she was old and strong enough
to get along in the world without their
aid. She had no money, so to get some
as quickly as possible she hied her to
a Pacific street dance hall and there
applied for and instantly obtained em
ployment. While whirling in the mazy
she* was rudely seized by a big police
man, who informed her that if she did
not go home she would go to jail. So
she went forth at 1 o'clock yesterday
morning to find a place to lay her head
and was arrested three hours later by
Patrolman A. B. Thompson, who found
her wandering aimlessly on Mission
street.
Georgie McDonald, a statuesque
blonde, swayed without visible propul
sion as she informed Judge Fritz that
to convict her of drunkenness would be
one of the crimes of the' new century.
"For," she added, with thickened ut
terance, "I haven't tashted liquor for
more'n a month."
His Honor gazed pensively at Miss
McDonald's towering coiffure and
calmly said she was drunk that very
moment.
"Nonshense," she protested. |"If I
wash drunk do you think I Scould
shpeak as well as I'm shpeakin'? You
don't know me, kidâ yeronner, I means
to shay, kido!"
"Take her away," sighed the Judge,
and the bailiff responded just in time
to receive Miss McDonald with open
arms as she was toppling off the wit
ness stand.
"Then we'll dismiss this case," said
the Judge. "The Innnpont plants must
not be allowed to suffer for sins which
were not of their making."
Mrs. Nye reminded the court of a
time-honored axiom to the effect that
a man's house is his castle and while
she was not a man nor her dwelling a
turreted stronghold, she believed she
had a perfect right to repel forcible
Invasion by the Johnsons and their
ally, Johansen. Moreover, she would
like to have the court distinctly under
stand that she did not resort to the
use of firearms until she had exhausted
suasive effort to induce the invaders
to withdraw. Nor would she like to
have the court imagine that all the
uncomplimentary language exploded
preliminary to the gun-pulling was of
her uttering. Mrs. Johnsonâ who, by
the way, still owes some room rental
indulged in a few unprintable words
before she was elected at pistol point.
So far as possession of the plants was
concerned, Mrs. Nye wouldn't give a
snap of her flneers for a cartload of
such truck. It was to preserve them
from perishing of Mrs. Johnson's neg
ligence that she took and nurtured
them and if she were sent to jail they
would surely die for want of water.
Mr. Johansen explained that it was
not his purpose to extend his narrative
unnecessarily â that he had unfor
tunately twisted the meaning of a col
loquialism. Then he told how he saw
Mrs. Nye take the pistol from a closet
and aim it at the head of Mrs. John
son, and how he wrested the weapon
from Mrs. Nye's hand. That's all
there was to it.
Inability to dwell in peace with their
landlady, Mrs. Honorah Nye, caused
John Johnson and his wife Freda to
transfer their personal belongings from
611 Jessie street to a house managed by
a wdman who seemed to be of more en
durable temperament. Soon after the
removal, however, it occurred to Mrs.
Johnson that she had forgotten some
potted plants that she had entrusted to
Mrs. Nye's temporary keeping, so she
and her husband and a friend of theirs,
Nels Johansen, went to 611 Jessie
street last Thursday evening and de
manded the plants. Instead of com
plying with the demand Mrs. Nye lev
eled a pistol at the head of Mrs. John
son and threatened to muss up the sit
ting-room carpets with that lady's
brains if she did not immediately go
away. Mrs. Johnson discreetly accept
ed the life preserving alternative, but
returned soon afterward with a police
man and gave Mrs. Nye into custody
on the charge of assault with a deadly
weapon. Police Judge Cabaniss heard
the case yesterday morning and the
stellar witness for the prosecution was
Nels Johansen, because of his compar
ative disinterestedness.
"Ay tank Ay save Mistress Tonson's
life," said Mr. Johansen. after v- had
been duly sworn. Then he stared at
the attorney for the defense, as if in
viting Interrogation.
"Well, go. on; tell 'is abojit it/* said
the Judge, encouragingly.
"Ay will try to mak a short storay
long â "
"No you won't," shouted his Honor.
"This court has no time to waste in
listening to unnecessary details. Your
story cannot; be too short to suit me.
Now go ahead and give it to us as
briefly as you can without omitting im
portant particulars."
Frederick Link presented for Judge
Fritz's inspection two beautifully writ
ten pledges to abstain from the con
sumption of intoxicating liquors for a
period of one year from last Thursday.
The documents bore the signatures of
Mr. Link and his wife, both of whom
were arrested for drunkenness and re
leased by Judge Fritz on condition that
they "swear off" for a twelvemonth.
Judge Fritz complimented Mr. Link on
his promptness in fulfilling his prom
ise and then released him from further
liability to the court.
Among those who witnessed the afore
described incident was Patrick Carolan,
accused of drunkenness on Clementina
street, and when he was set up for ex
amination he expressed a desire to em
ulate the example of the Links, and
promised to appear in court next Mon
day and show his pledge. The Judge
took him at his word.

books of the windjammer that con- j
