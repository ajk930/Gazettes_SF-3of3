WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â The . assem
bling to-day of the members of the Fifty-
ninth Congress for their first session was .
marked , by 'no unusual incidents, but it
attracted to the Capitol crowds of spec
tators who took a lively interest in the
proceedings. The day was beautiful. The
sun shone brightly and the air was keen.
Society was out In force and , filled the
reserved galleries, while visitors, unable
to find seats, roamed the corldors to catch
glimpses of public men.
In the Senate the proceedings were
brief.. but most of the spectators seemed
to find aulte as much to interest them in
observing the Senators who remained on
the floor after adjournment as they could
have experienced had the session con
tinued longer. â¢
â\u25a0 The House was in session more than
three hoars, and while the proceedings
followed the programme* tnat had marked
the opening of Congress for many years,
there was* enough interest to hold an
exceptionally large audience during the
entire, time^ , v " - ~. \u25a0
~ r One" noticeable feature was the absence
of; ; CowersÂ» * heretofore ..have been
'common to". both 'â¢ chambers. On*"openlng '
days the display bad been so great that
the, exhibition alone would have been snf
cierit^to draw great crowds, and the ah
sence.of floral tributes, due to a resolu
tion adopted unanimously by the Senate
and to; an order of the Speaker in the
House, robbed the occasion of much of its
picturesqueness. . , .
-During the session Senators and Repre
sentatives visited the' galleries and
chatted with friends.
Senators Allison and Morgan were ap
pointed by Vice President Fairbanks as a
committee to notify the President that
Congress was ready for any communica
tion he desired to make. The Senate was
,in session only twenty minutes. Senators
Aldrich of Rhode Island. Knoz of Penn
sylvania. Warner of Missouri and Fra
zer of Tennessee took the oath of office,
and an adjournment was taken as a mark
of respect to the late Senator Platt of
Connecticut.
The preliminary steps to organization
were taken by the House. Joseph G.
Cannon of Illinois was re-elected Speaker;
the members of the House took the oath
of office; the officers and floor employes
of the body were re-elected; the rules of
the last : Congress were adopted, art!
members went through the formality of
drawing for seats, all of which was en
livened by the presence of the crowds in
the galleries, the animation of the reunion
of. veteran members and interest in new
ones.
â¢In a brief speech against the adoption
of the rules the minority leader. Williams
of Mississippi, touched on the interest of
the country in tariff legislation, and told
of. the new Republican "ideas", which
were belrrg **wafted to Washington on
breezes from every part of the country."
These, he said, might be properly legis
lated should the "minority of . the major
ity"- stand with the Democratic members
in opposing the adoption of J the old rules
and forming new ones which would per
mit consideration : of such legislation as
popular opinion might dictate.
. A committee lwas appointed to act with
the Senate committee in notifying Presi
dent . Roosevelt that Congress ; was ready
to transact business; the rules 'committee
and the \ Committee on Mileage were ap
pointed, and the House adjourned after a
session which lasted â¢ three and a halt
hours, in "compliance with resolutions an

BILLS DRAWN
BY WILLIAMS
Many Measures Indicating
Drift of Democratic Policy
Introduced in the House
ATTACKS ON TARIFF
Mi nority Leader Proposes a
Twenty Per Cent Reduc
tion in Dirigley Schedules
WASHINGTON.' Dec. '4:â Representative
Williams of Mississippi, trie leader of the
minority In the House, to-day introduced
a number of bills and joint ; resolutions
affecting ihe tariff and campaign contri
butions. These contemplate free trade
with the, Philippines; a reassembling of
the United States and Canadian Joint
High .Commission,, with a . view to freer
trade relations between the United States
and Canada, and a tariff for
the United Sta tea. " The bill regarding
campaign contributions- forbids Federal
corporations chartered by' thoV Federal
Government and engaged in; interstate
commerce from making j such, contribu
tions.' These measures,- it is. believed, in
dicate the probable course of the minor
ity; on the subject, of the tariff envision
and reciDrocity and the question of con
tributions in. politicar* campaigns.
; WiUiams said to-day, that- other *, bills
may be looked for, -as he 'would- not be
satisfied .with : revision to " the extent in
dicated, but from bis standpoint ; it, was
merely the first step in the right direc
tion and an invitation .to the Republican
party to declare its intentions/
Williams introduced a bill to authorize
the Imposition of an income tax.': /
The Philippines tariff bill provides that
all articles the, product, and growth of
the Philippines shall be. admitted into the
United , States free of "import ! duty, r and
that all articles the product and growth
of the, balance of the United States shall
bo admitted into the "Philippines: free of
import, duty, and that nothing contained
in the bill shall be construed to "repeal
any provision of the Paris treaty between
the United States and Spain.- :;, â¢ ; ;
Another bill proposes . to establish a
minimum tariff of- the United States. It
declares- the existing tariff- schedules tp
constitute the maximum- tariff r of^ the
United States and a reduction of 30^ per
cent from them, or* rates equal ' to four
fifths of the' existing duties, to" consti
tute the minimum \u25a0 tariff of the Uhitea
States.
Williams said 'he had " selected *20 per
cent "as the amount of reduction to be
made in order to constitute a minimum
tariff,. although he thought that the. re
duction should be greater than that,. out
of deference to Republican -opinions and
to give Republicans who are sincere. and
honest in their, desire to reduce the tariff
an opportunity to act, with the knowl
edge that they would meet with no fac
tious opposition."- bu^ with - the^ " hearty^
support -of the" Democrats.: a> ; â¢<!â¢.â¢ ,Yr os ! ?
Another bill by Williams Is to^amjend
section. l 6 of . the Dingily, act. , s . lt forbids
any common carrier or iransportation
agency of any sort, ''including express"
companies, from transporting spirituous,
%inousPr malt Hauors Into* any State or.

The fatal prize-fight on board a war
ship in the West Indies is alluiied to and
the recommendation made that closer, su
pervision be exercised over these con
tests hereafter by the" officers. Fighting
at the naval academy Is condemned,, and
the Secretary . says the practice must be
suppressed.- ' \u25a0 â¢ . t:
MAXY SHIPS OBSOIiETC
An increase in the marine corps,and the,
upbuilding of the naval militia of the sev
eral States Is strongly advised. "...',
The repeal of the statute, requiring" the
transportation of supplies for the hayy;in
American bottoms' is recommended: : ..'. \u25a0
The- Secretary proposes' that a -new
ship be: added, to the navy to.be named
the Constitution," to perpetuate r the .'name
made famous . by ' the fighting frigate |of
the war'-of 1812J- In- this connection the
Secretary says the vessel now known. as
the Constitution in reality contains "but
few portions qf the original Bhip.
. The. department recommends the 'au
thorization of the following thirteen ad
dition* to the 'navy: .Two battleships,
$15,000,000; two : scout . cruisers, , $4,000,000;
four destroyers, $3,000,000;. two submarines

the Helena type. $6O0,0QO:. two river gun-
boats. J200.000; total. $23,300,000/ V .' . \u25a0/ Â» :
, The Secretary ... suggests that the battle-
Vhipn be of 16,000 tons displacement, with
eight twelve-inch guntC This type is
thought to be more desirable r than that
'of 18,000 tons recommended" by the gen

1 WASHINGTON, , Dec. Aâ, The annual re- 1
port of \u25a0' Attorneys General [ Moody, \u25a0 which ]
j was given out to-day, is devoted I largely j
J to : 'a discussion of the anti-trust laws and]
I the -suits against corporations brought,- by ;
' the : Government. , The Attorney^ General
says; that the . railroads still disobey, the
law, despite | the best .efforts ; of \u25a0. the Gov
\u25a0 eVnment- agents. -He states: . -<: *. ',' " \u25a0â¢'
\u25a0 Offlctals'of railroads; have In jteneral terms
assursd-me: of "their wllUngnena to aid the de
partment in every way *.\n . enforcing tbÂ« Pâ¢:
visions of the law* against^ rebates, disctlmina- <
â¢ tlons and departures trom 'published raies, but |
have declined to render- the .: only assistance ,
that -would be'df the :sJliÃhteBt vaiue, namely. 1
the furnif.hlpj;"ot:evldence provlntf the onense. 1
To every case-- ot this" kind : there are two 1
guilty parties.- .The department- has been and
ts willing to accept the evidence either or -tne
shipper or of. the. railroad, official, giving him
the' immunity trpm \u25a0> prosecution ? which , would
reault-trom theÂ»uÂ»e^of thÂ« -evidence, ; and to 1
proceed' by indictment | against i the other guilty |
party . But," lor reasons . which will be appre- 1
elated fey all; men have I thrunk- from betray
ing their confederate's. The cases,, therefore. In
which, evidence has been ;or will: be obtained
are occasional and exceptional, and | unless we
are content, to allow .the evil .. of.-. the â¢ discrimi
natory practice .' by" common "carriers to con
tinue, with now and then the punishment of a
detected crime, - some Â»* remedy which - reaches
deeper than any law now upon the statute dook
must '-be' found.'.- -: - , >T 7 : '"' j \i.~
I The Interstate Commerce Commission and the
Department of Justice, by the qxerciFcof the
utmost diligence, can > discover and ...prohibit or
punish "o9ly a Bmall percentage of the .discrim
inatory, practice? - which actually exist. It;
seems- probable that the' direct. payment of re
bates in' irfoney has , largely diminished. It Is
alleged to be true, and. the evidence, before this
department^, so lar as it goes, tends to support
the allegation . that, though- elotheac and- dis
guised by various devices; the practice of giving
one shipper' preferential treatment over another,
Jir' like situation. In j substance, still continues.
If the power, upon complaint, to fix a future
maximum rate and put It Into effect' within a
reasonable tlrae, subject to appeal to the courtg,
should .be given to some ; administrative body
created by Congress, a weapon agalnst"dlscrlm-
Inatory Dracticis, much more potent" than any.
now available,-: would-be put Into the hands of
the .Government.- Upoa proof .- that a lower
rate had been given "to eoms preferred shipper,
the body clothed with, the power -to-fix a
future â¢ maximum. -.rate : might r well . determine
that the . rate Â« which the . railroad could afford
to give to the preferred "shipper it could afford
to give to an shippers in VUe- situation.- â¢ Such ;
a finding, it could- I>* predicted' with certainty,
the courts upon appeal would ; not . reverse, - for
jio \u25a0 better . evidence -of the legality, and justice
of the rate thus fixed could be found than In
'the action -of the carrier It6elf. \u25a0- It -would be
difficult for. the carrier' to maintain that a rate
actually charged, by It was conflscatory or un-

ST. PETERSBURG. Sunday, Dec. 3, 9
p. m. (via Eydtkuhnen. East Prussia,
Etec- i-)â The city remains quiet, but ex
treme teneion prevails. .Armed patrols
of cavalry and infantry are iq the streets,
eepedally in the neighborhood of the
telegraph office. The telegraph and postal
tie up remains complete. Soldiers and
employes of other departments are being
used to deliver portions of the vast ac
cumulation of mail.
The telegraph operators met yesterday's
threat to discharge them to-day unless
they returned *to work by resolving to
prosecute the strike until 'their demands
are satisfied. The League of Leagues,
which is issuing decrees like a veritable
provisional government, has openly de
fied the prefect's warning to walking dele
gates and agitators that any attempt to
persuade employes to leave their work
would lead to :ihÂ«ir arrest and the im
position, of a fine of Â£50 by issuinc a
counter proclamation warning not . only
the Russian but the Danish operators to
work at their peril.
The authorities profess confidence that
the strike will be broken In a few days,
but the basis of their optimism is not
stated. The immolation of Interior Min
ister Durnovo seems to offer a way of
retreat for the Government. This" in
volves another surrender before the vic
torious proletariat.
TALK OF A DICTATORSHIP.
Count de Witte is now convinced that
the Emperor, by acceding to' the demand
for universal suffrage, may still find a
common ground on whieli the Government
and the moderates and the extreme ele
ments can stand. If this fail to stay the
headlong march of events, the proclama
tion of a ready-made constitution might
b<? tried as the laet card. .Then nothing
would remain except the presentation of
a dictatorship.
Competent judges of the situation be
lieve that a dictatorship, while it might
restrain the rising flood temporarily,
would only increase the dimensions of the
cataclysm, and, when the dam goes,
sweep the- Government and dynasty away
to common 'ruin. â¢ V ">\u25a0â¢
In order to convince the Zemstvoists
that the Government is honostly trying
to meet the .wishes of the moderate and
substantial elements, Count do Witte has
invited not only a. deputation of the Mos
cov Congress, but a number of other
Zemstvotets, to participate in the sessions
<>f tlie Cabinet on the election law, which
v ere continued last night and to-day.
Count de Witte appealed to the patriotism
of the Zemstvoista. saying it was their
duty not to inflame the situation, but to
co-operate la saving the country from
complete anarchy.
DECISION OX ELECTION LAW.
A decision was reached to grant prac
tically universal, secret and equal suf
frage to males 25 years of age, onS the
basis of one representative for each 250,

ADVERTISEMENTS.
New Version of
an Old Adage
Do You Eat for Mere Stimulation or
for Real Nutrition?,
In matters of money, there is an old
adage that pays, "It's not so much
what you" earn as what you save." and
Just so, in the question of food and
health, it might be said as truly, "It's
not so much what you eat as what real
nourishment you get out of what you
eat."
This is the secret of health, strength
and vitality. No difference how much
nutrition your food contains, if your
system does not assimilate that nutri-
tionâtake it up and distribute it
throughout your body â you gain noth-
ing beyond a temporary stimulation by
having eaten It.
Malta-Vita, best, whole white wheat
mixed with pure barley malt extract,
thoroughly steamed and cooked and
every flake baked to a crisp, is rich
in nutrition and is assimilated readily
even by the weakest stomach. Every
one of its health-giving, strength-
building elements fs taken" up by the
human economy to nourish and sustain
life. â¢ j .?aijygiÃ3H^^Bri^MjpHÃpÃfl^JK'&flyifHaj^ i fpis*f"^'
No wonder that Malta- Vita is called
"The Perfect Food," and that physi-
cians recommend it- for the sick' and
the well, the weak and the strong. .;
â¢ And Malta-Vita is so good to cat-
not at all like the tasteless variety of
flaked foods. A perfect breakfast is
impossible without.it and It's just as
good three times a day. Try a bowl-
ful with cream or s fruit. You never
.tasted anything so good.
'\u25a0â¢ Malta- Vita is always ready , to eat.
No cooking, no inconvenience. All gro-
cers. '. ' . ' ' - '-\u25a0\u25a0.--

refused to yield any suffrage to the coun
try districts, where there will be a double
set of electors. Unless the extremists are
willing to accept this solution, the sup
port of the moderates will not greatly
improve the situation, as the latter in the
present crisis are almost a negligible
quantity.
Perhaps it is too much to hope that
the Social Revolutionary leaders, drunk
â¢with the success achieved, can be in
duced to cease their efforts, which are
now entirely directed to winning over the
army. The telegraph operators have re
plied to Count de Witte's refusal to treat
with them with an open letter, declaring
they will have no negotiation with In
terior Minister Durnovo and must now
continue the strike until the abrogation of
all Government measures to prevent the
organization and activity of their Con
gress and the liberation and reinstate
ment of their allied comrades.

BERLIN, Dec. i.â A dispatch to the
Lokal Anzeiger from Kieff via Podwolo

ter place at 10:15 a. m., says:
"Martial law was declared at Kieff yes

I "The troops at Kharkoff refuse to take
the oath of fealty to the colors.
! "Great turbulence prevails at Kishenev.
{ The precise character of the events there
Sis not yet known., but the Thirty-third
Artillery Brigade is reported to have mu
tinied.
"The cause of the mutiny of the Kieff
Engineering Corps is said to have been
the maltreatment of several soldiers and'
one officer by the commander.
"A strike has again broken out on the
I railway io Poltava, Moscow and Voro-.
| nee."
A dispatch to the Lokal Anzeiger from
Kieff via Podwoloczysma, Dec. 3, noon,
says: ,
"One company of a pontoon battalion
mutinied to-day, and, fully armed,
marched through the trying to
persuade other troops to join it. Only an
engineer corps did so. The mutineers,
then 2000 strong, continued their march.
Two hundred Cossacks were sent to pre
vent their advance, but General Drake,
in order to prevent bloodshed. suDse
qucntly withdrew the Cossacks and per
mitted the mutineers to pass.
"General Drake made repeated and
kindly efforts to persuade- the mutineers
to abandon their foolhardy course. A*
; part had complied, when Governor Gen
eral Sucholimaff telephoned an order that
ene rgetic measures be taken against the
mutineers and that the latter be fired
; upon at the first opportunity. The mu
tineers halted before the barracks of an
Azoff regiment, which was called upon to
join the marchers. During the demonstra
tion at the barracks several mutineers
fired, wounding an officer and two or
three soldiers. The troops then fired
upon the mutineers, who returned the
flre and fled after several more volleys by
the troops. The casualties on both sides
were about seventy dead and 300
wounded. Two. hundred mutineers sur
rendered.
"General Drake has been given leave
of absence and will be succeeded by Lieu
tenant General Karganoff. an energetic,
strict officer.
"A strike has broken but in the shops
of the Southwestern Railway and in all
the factories. The great mass, meetings
held in the Polytechnic Institute have
caused the authorities to close the lat
ter. All the . newspapers are subject to
the strictest censorship and the radical
publications consequently are not appear

The Odessa correspondent of the Lokal
Anzeiger telegraphs, as follows:
"The employes of the telegraph and
postal departments continue on strike, :
which has led the central officers at Mos

Official of Mutual Tells : of Trou ble With
â¢ Clunie of Galifornia.
\u25a0 NEWUYORK, -Dec. 4.â The most inter
'estingc development Un the legislative â¢ life
insurance * inyestigaiion i( was ; contained in
the testimony! of ; Horace;A. Brockway, a
hotel proprietor and director . of the | Mu
tual U. ReserveT Llf eT-i Insurance Company,"
who'saldithatiie^had given $6000 to Pres
ident Frederick' 'AT, Burnham of, that com
pany;; at ; the; demand of Burnham in IS9B.
Brockway; told \u25a0 the committee that . Burn
ham ; told : him \u25a0 t hat ' if '[. he would take 'out
a policy in i the Reserve^ he would
make ?him fa â¢- director. â¢ Brockway then
took out ; policies ; amounting : , to^ J6OOO. Af
ter, having been a* director, for. some tttne,
he .was \u25a0 put \on ;the j payroll 'of the^ com
pany ;at . S3OO a i week, received that salary
for - four/months, - : and " then . it was .cut â¢to
$200 i a week. ; Asked ". what he did ; to earn
that'money, he.said hejlooked over some
loans 'for; the ; company,' - was "consulted
by policy-holders sls ;to whether the ;'com
pany; was ; a" good f one.; to :\u25a0 Insure *in and
did .whatever .l he was â¢ asked to { do. 'He
had been getting; $300 ' a .week eight weeks
when Burnham i demanded the ?6000.
;':, TO CHECK PRESS ATTACKS.
X What President Burnham did with that
money '/was?. explained by George D. Eld
redge, tylce president and actuary of the
Matual ' Reserve Lif e ; Insurance Company,
who testified that President Burnham told
himhe had given it to Hilary Bell, a
newspaper man and publicity agent of
the company, : to secure the publication of
articles; favorable to the company at a
time when it-was being criticised In the
newspapers.! Bell had said that he could
accomplish much more with ' the monej
if he; were not compelled to report to the
company just what he' expended it for. ,j
Brockway said he was - still a director
of the company.
The reason why . President Burnham
was not : called before the 'committee .was
given by his physician, who told the com
mittee y to-day that Burnham is too *slck
to appear or even' to', make a deposition.
Vice President Eldredge \u25a0- testified I that^
his company 1 had 'much trouble with An
drew J. Clunie when _he was
tendent ;of Insurance of California, ana
in six years, from 1897. paid Thomas J.
Clunie, the Commissioner's brother, $7500
in counsel fees to represent the/company
before the , Insurance Commissioner and
Legislature of that State.
MUTUAI/S- FINANCIAL STRAITS.
George D. Eldredee was the first wit
ness to-day. He. said that $22,000,000 of
insurance in the Mutual Reserve Life In
surance Company lapsed in 1904. on-which
the compa ny - paid in cash , surrender I $75,
000. Besides this, the company also
charged off about $250,000 in loans due
the company . on the \u25a0 policies lapsed : and
allowed $2,000,000 or $3,000,000 of extended
insurance. Eldredge said that in 1899 the
-Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company
had reached a point where it would have
been compelled to increase its assess
ments to maintain Its reserve. Instead,
the members of the company voted to
apply; to the payment of death claims the
portion of the assessments' which had
been going to the reserve fund. : ; : .
.."You "mean by .members that President
'Burnham voted; the r> proxies ?". 3aid

Eldredgesald^that Mr^Harper was tnen
president of , the company, and. that he did
not; know whether. the proxies were voted
at Vthat "meeting. T He j thought the action
was'a great mlstaVc. Since that time the
company ; had been 'compelled to . create
Hens against the" policies and levy /special
assesments.
BROCKWA Y'S $6000 "GIFT."
Horace H' Brockway was called. He is
proprietor of the Ashland , House ' and has
been â¢ connected with the ! Mutual Reserve
Company - for Â« ten / years." He became : a
director of the company at the request of
President'- Burnham. [ Brockway got, first
$10 and then $20 a # week as a director. On
March 23. 1898. he was put- on the payroll
of. the company at $300 a week. To', earn
this . salary. he attended to alterations on
buildings ' and v was consulted about; loans,
and by policy-holders as to the "status of
the" company.'; About two .months after
he went on. salary President Burnham
told the witness he was getting a good
salary - and asked for a gift of $6000. . The
witness gave it"' to . him. . Burnham never
promised to repay:: it and never- did so.
!Thewitness regarded it as a gift. ,
"Brcckway said thatafter. he. had been
drawing his salary .for /eleven months he
told i i President: Burnham Â» -he was not
earning his salary 'and asked that -he be' I
dropped; from the; company's payroll.
; "Didn't you tell; him you had;only;been
on the* payroll eight weeks at. $300 a'week
when" he struck you for $6000?" asked
Hughes. ;
"No- 1 ;' I thought he was a good fellow."
The witness said he expected to.bekept
on the payroll. He got back in all $6500 in
salary, i Brockway -is still a director in
the company.*'
George D. Eldredge again went on the
stand. ;', He said fthat , in 1894 It ; had ' been

Eldredge that he got the $6doo from
Brockway and expended It. through Hil
ary Bell in securing the publication of
'articles favorable to the company. In 1599
the .witness first heard of the $6000. when
Wells, before" the insurance department,
made certain charges. In January, â¢ 1898.
Bell applied to President Burnham and
the witness for $5000 or $6000 to expend
personally, without rendering bills to the
company, and Bell said later that he got
the money. The witness said it. was not
charged to . the " advertising account. At
that time the company was being bitterly
attacked In the newspapers, and the wit
ness asked Bell to do something about it.
Eldredge. at Hughes' request, produced
a statement of the company's legal ex
penses.";'
J. Thompson 'Patterson, Eldredge said,
was / employed .by 'the Mutual ; Reserve
' Life, Insurance Company in 1596 as corre
sponding secretary, and, after he left its
employ^ 'made charges against President
\u25a0Frederick A. Burnham and Eldredge.
Burnham and Eldredse had. him arrested
on a charjc of criminal libel and. when
he was discharged " by the court, secured
his Indictment , by a grand jury. They
also : brought civil suits for libel against
him. ""Patterson" brought counter suits
for' libel against Burnham and Eldredge.
Tfie counsel for the two officers died,
and they settled the trouble by the pay
ment of $5000 to Patterson from the funds
of the' Mutual Reserve Life" Insurance
Company..^ Eldredge said they paid it to
avoid the expense of securing new coun
sel and to prevent' tbe publication of /fur
ther charges against "the company."
CLUNIE AND THE. MUTUAL.
ilughes then took up the Mutual Re
serve Life Insurance Company's legal ex
penses.' Eldredge said . there had been
considerable ' legal expenss by his com
pany in California, when Andrew J. Clunie
was Superintendent of Insurance in that
State. ".The Mutual Reserve Company re
tained Thomas J. Clunie, brother iof the
Insurance Commissioner, as its counsel,
and paid him $7500, from 1897 to 1903. Com
missioner ; Clunio had raised tbe point
that the company ought to include in its
policies the provision of . the California
law relating to non-forfeiture and to
furnish certain lists of its policy-holders
in that State. , The' witness said he en-
Pgaged Thomas J. Clunie, and that he was
an attorney of high standing. Thomas J.
Clunie represented the Mutual Reserve
Company before the Insurance Depart
ment and before the Legislature of Cali
fornia. The license of the company, the
witness said, was held in suspense during
the last two years in which Andrew J.
Clunie was Insurance Commissioner. It
was issued near the end of his term.
â¢ During Clunle's term." the company was
in *trouj>le jj in California nearly all the
time, Eldredjfe â¢ added. The successor to
Clunie, the" witness .did not
give the company a license to do business
in- California, but insisted upon making
an investigation, to ' which the company
did not submit.
TROUBLES: IN NEW YORK."
- The company engaged counsel to repre
sent .it before ". the New . York Insurance
Department In various examinations.
James F. Pierce was retained, by the Mu^
tual Reserve ' Company after he was Su
perintendent; of Insurance of this State
from 1891 to 1597.. .
#LHughes said it had been charged in 1599
that a report of the Superintendent of In
surarice containing charges against the
Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company
was afterward modified, and asked if this
was true. Eldredge said it .was not un
usual, as most of . the â¢ complaints made
againsts t the , compa ny by th c , Superin
tendents were subsequently modified. The
witness said he did not know whether the
Superintendent of Insurance examined
the I company; on all ''the charges tÃen
made, but he knew that the company
asked Vanderpool, the examiner, to make
a report on all charges. The company
did "not receive the findings on them,
however. ,*:/,//'

Experiments Being' Made in
the East by a Professor
pf Columbia University
USES VERY THIN WIRE
Line Will Be Connected on
Thursday and First Trial
of Theory Will Be Made
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
PITTSBURG. Pa.. Dec 4.â Professor
Pupin of Columbia University has been
making experiments whereby a conver
sation may be carried on between New
York and. San Francisco over a very thin
wire. His method is based on the theory
that by the use of loaded cells tbe sounds
of the yoice can be carried almost any
distance and overcome the resi3taneg~*in
the atmosphere.
Professor Pupin is making experiments
in Sewickley. a suburb of this city. He
has used wire one-elzhth of an Inch
thick, and his first successful use of so
thin a line was made to-day between
Sewickley and McKeesport. He has ar
ranged with the Bell telephone system
whereby a line will be connected between
New York and San Francisco. Thl3 line
Is now complete with .the exception of *
ninety-mile stretch in Dakota , and an
other short reach in Colorado. Just as
soon. as. these lines are connected, which
will be next Thursday. Prof :ssor f Pupin
intends to make a demonstration to prove
that his theory of sound carrying Is cor
rect. SaM
Professor Pupin believes that long dis
tance telephony will be revolutionized ir
his theory proves correct. By the use of
his loaded cells he can carry sound the
longest distance that telephone wires can
be strung at a very small cost. The wires
now in use for long distance telephony
are heavy copper rods and tb^e expense
connected with stringing the lines and
the heavy charge of electricity necessary
to carry the sound make them very ex
pensive for long distance operation.

was carrying great volumes of -burning
oil into the creek and threatening "to

The Board of Supervisors- yesterday

.Previous to the submission of th 9
plans, .which -were .-approved by the
board, there ., was a little scene in Wood
ward's .olflce. due to the fact that the
official named refused to file" the plans
until next Monday. Woodward took the
stand . that two sets of plans had been
prepared, .ono' for the main road ana
the other for the extension; and it
would take one week . to combine the
two in accordance. with the terms of
the ;resolutibn passed by the Bbard'ot
Supervisors. , Mayor SchmlU had heard
of Woodward's intention to delay the
submission -of the plans, and, as his
Honor - had promised the board at the
last meeting that they would be ready
in a week, he sent his secretary, George
Keane." to endeavor to induce Wood-,
ward to change his mind. Supervisors
Payot , and "D'Anconna of the ' Finance
Committee also used their good effices
in the matter, but .Woodward was ob
durate. When Payot said the plans
were complete Woodward angrily re
plied^ they were not. The debate be
came heated, and "the dispute seemed
to be far from settlement. "
KKANE OIWECTS TO DELAY.
' "STou have not advanced a good rea
son for holding Back the plans," * said
Keane to Woodward," who thereupon
started to. walk away from his office.*
Finally it was suggested that' all
withdraw except B'Auconna, who; then
used his persuasive powers with such
good effect that Woodward relented and
agreed to file the plans. â¢
The board ordered demands drawn

MUSmSMSID TRIAL FOR ALLEGED ASSAULT
Defendant Offers No
Evidence in the
Case.
Court Says Miss
Olsen's Charge
Seems True.
BERKELEY. Dec. 4.â Lester , Mc-
Kulty is to answer before the Superior
Court to the charge of feloniously at
tacking Miss Dorothy Olsen. Justice
Edgar to-day held the young politician,
\u25a0whose case has stirred the political,
fraternal and social circles of Alameda
County, in bonds of $2000, and directed
that he be remanded to the custody of
the Sheriff of the county until bail is
given. McNulty promptly secured
bondsmen In the person of John
Havens, a Berkeley capitalist, and
George Schmidt, postma: ter of the
college town.
No evidence was introduced by Mc-
Xuitys attorney. A. L. Frick, to
counteract that put forward by the
prosecution. When Deputy District At-*
torncy Everett Brown closed his case
at noon to-day, and said, "The people
rest," the attorney who is defending
McNulty. promptly said, "We rest,
also."
Justice Edgar called for the com
plaint, read it over, and then said:
It appearing to me that the offense in the
matter mentioned in the complaint on file, to
\u25a0wit: Assault with intent to commit rape, has
b^>n committed, and that there is sufficient
*aus 2 to believe tb? within named Lester C.
McNuSty. rullty thereof, I order that he be
bcid to answer and committed to the Sheriff of
thÂ» county of Alameda. and that he be ad
mitted to bail in the nun of $2000, and is com
mitted to the Sheriff of the said county of
Alamecia until he fives euch bail.
Lester McNulty was positively iden
tified in court this morning, when the
hearing was resumed, by A. G. Alvis. a
street car conductor, as the -man who
rode on his car. with Dorothy Olsen,
on tbe night of November 6, and who
stepped from the car a few seconds
after the girl had alighted. Alvis
stated that McNulty carried a light
grray coat, which McNulty has since
udmitted was his own, but which he
claims was stolen from him on the day
of the attack upon Miss Olsen.
SAI-rVATIOX ARMY CAP.
A Salvation Army cap was worn by
Alvis. The cap was referred to as an
indication of Alvis' opinion of the of
fenEe charged against McNulty. Alvis
declared that McNulty'e actions on the
car with respect to Miss Olsen were
such as made him wish he could have
thrown the offender off. He accused
McNulty of "eying" the girl, as they
rode out from Oakland to Berkeley, and
said the looks he gave the young
woman were "vulgar looks."
Nervous and eager, apparently, to
give convincing testimony, the witness
vas given several embarrassing mo
ments under the keen cross-examina
tion of Attorney Fri<sk, who sought to
straw that Alvis had not been able to
recall McNulty's appearance or the
fact that McNulty had used a deputy
sheriff's badge in lieu of paying fare
until gome time after the case became
public property, and McNulty was im
pllca.tc6. : - .Â»
Alvis swore that McNulty used a
badge numbered 20 or 21, and Attorney
Frick asked him if he had not inform
ed Arthur McDonald, a newspaper man
of Berkeley, the day after the assault,
that "he had a story for him, as he
believed his car had carried the girl
who was assaulted and the man who
assaulted her, but that he could not
rrcall whether the man In the case
had paid him a fare or . rode on a
transfer."
Alvis admitted that he had said
something which might have given the
newspaper man such an Impression.
Attorney Frick brought out the fact
that McNulty rode again on Alvis' car
the day after the assault In company
with OfScer Farrar, en rocte to the
Marshall home on Telegraph avenue to
meet Miss Olsen, and that although
Officer Farrar asked him If ho could
Identify the man who assailed the girl,
and Alvis said be could, he failed to
observÂ«Â«that McNulty was standing
then almost at his side. .
OVEIICOAT IS IDENTIFIED.
Alvis explained this by , saying thai
McNulty then stood with his back to
him.. The railroad man, queried r^
yarding his animus in the case, admit
ted that he took a special interest
In It. /

Sophie Peterson, a maid employed at
the Marshall home, where Miss Olsen also
was a domestic, testified that her fellow
servant" informed her on Sunday night,
November 6, at about 10 o'clock, that she"
had been attacked by ja ' strange man on
the lawn of the house adjoining, the
Marshall mansion.
Detective Jamison identified the gray
overcoat, which was retained by Miss Ol
sen after her struggle with her assailant,
as a garment he had procured from the
girl the day after the assault.
The admission of McNulty that the gar
ment was his property was testified to by
Marshal' Vollmer, who stated that Mc-
Nulty came with his father to the Mar
shal's office two days after the assault
and explained that his overcoat had been
stolen. Reading In the newspapers of an
overcoat which Miss Olsen had, which
resembled the one he lost, McNulty said
he thought It proper to Investigate, ' and
upon looking at the coat in Marshal Voll
mer's possession identified it as his propj
erxy. . ,
CONTRACTOR TESTIFIES.
"Mr. McNulty wished to take posses
sion of the coat," said Marshal Vollmer,
"and I told" him an order of "court would
be required for that. It was suggested at
that conference that McNulty go to Miss
Olsen and permit. her to say. whether or
not he was. the man who had attacked
her. I do not recall by whom the sug
gestion was made, but McNulty assent
ed." â¢
Testimony regarding the rescue of Miss
Olsen from the clutches of her assailant
was given by John Wallen, a contractor,
who heard the girl's screams when about
150 feet from the scene and hurried to the
place. Wallen could not \u25a0 identify ". Mc-
Nulty as the man . he met going away,
from the scene, nor could he identify Miss
Olsen as the girl . who was assisted . by
him to her home, a short distance away.
Th.c witness was driving .down - Stuart
street, near Telegraph avenue, \u25a0 when the.
girl's screams . caused him to turn back,
and , while walking toward the ; Marshall
home â¢ he' met a stranger and : asked \ him
what was. the trouble. The stranger sug
gested that the police be ccallerd r and then
walked- away.
."That man,", said Wallen, "was -tall,
muscular. and stout. If I had- attacked
him I * think he would have - given me : a
pretty good' wrestje." â¢-'!-â¢:
Wallen said the stranger wore a light
colored vest and had a dark, complexion,
similar to : McNulty's. " Miss Olsen- told
him , she had "been ; assaulted, * and he
helped her to, her home.

ARREST SPOILS
CONVICT'S GAME
SACRAMENTO, Dec. :4.â J. Stiles,
known at the Folsom State'prison as
VRed Shirt". Stiles because of his . des
perate r character, and who was dis
charged from Folsom' two weeks ago,
was arrested near - the prison to-day
with four: big revolvers in his pockets.
It is believed he intended to "plant" the
pistols in the State prison yard prepar
atory to another outbreak by the con
victs. Stiles is a chum of Kid Thomp
son, a desperate convict. For -several
days Thompson had been" hinting to
other convicts that he "expected, to
have a lots of guns." A charge of
vagrancy had been placed - against
Stiles, as that is the . only accusation
that legally can be made. The authori
ties firmly believe that Stiles intended
to furnish arms to the convicts,. '.'.'but
cannot prove It, as he had not gained
access to the State prison grounds.

â¢â¢ OAKLAND, Dec. : 4.â -Souther Farm,
the princely home of Edna ' Wallace
Hopper, the actress, near San Leandro.
which she inherited from her mother,
the late Josephine Durtsmuir, is to be
sold to pay the claims against tt. -~W.
S. Leake, the executor of the will of
Mrs. Dunsmuir, stated to; Judge Ogderi'
this morning- in the Probate Court that
there were $30,000 worth of claims for
bric-a-Tarae bought by Mrs. Dunsmuir
agrainst the estate, besides $16,866
worth of debts and that he saw no way '
in which to pay them off unless the
place was sold. m \ ..-\u25a0..
In regard to the claims for" bric-a
brac, there are several \ suits pending
against the estate which Judge Ogden
advised be compromised, as be says
that he has one of the suits in his de
partment and he cannot see how the
estate can get out of paying the claims.

Souther Farm, consisting of several
hundred acres of land, is one of the
most beautiful country residences in
Alameda County and waft laid out by
the late Alexander Dunsmuir on a scale '
of magnificence In proportion to* his

$125,000, but this gives n* Indication
of the cost of the place which, with its
drives, electric plant and other ap
pointments. Is said to have cost $500,000.
LANE ADDBESSES
UNIVERSITY SEEN
San Francisco Attorney Tells
of Possibilities of Trade
With Mexico. -
BERKELEY, Dec. 4.â Franklin K. Lane
of San Francisco addressed the students
of the college of commerce this afternoon,
giving them Â«nme of thÂ» results of his
observations during a recent trip to Mex
ico. The southern republic, declared Lane,
is better governed than the average
American city, with better paved streets,
better police service . and with railways
under the control, for the most part, of
the \u25a0Government. â .-'
President Diaz was extolled by Mr. Lane
as the man responsible, more than any
other, for Mexico's good government and
the nation's pi oapertly. He _Is dictator,
virtually, although nominally but a pres
ident. I ane said:
The possibilities -. of trade with Mexico are
not appreciated by Sap Francisco merchants,
but little attempt bslng made to study that
country's need* or demands. Los Angeles men
are seeking to get a share of the trade, and
deserve success for .their enterprise. American
capital should be Invested with caution In
Mexico, as many millions cent there for-'in
vestment have gone wrong through the rascal
ity, of promoters. The possibilities are great,
*>ut the. need of prudence is *eÂ«n at- every step.
The land eventually will be even more pros
perous than it Is. and the nation which now
secures . a foothold in the way of trade rela
tions will reap Incalculable benefits later.

Telpehone. Company V of Alameda County
to-nlgnt won its fight against its- competi
tors: by a bid<of $35,431*30 in the .City
I Council. This ampunt is nearly -double
I the minimum figure âat the corporation
guaranteed when^ it first applied for a
I franchise, but the company ' was deter
mined not to be outbid and had $3(Â£oOO in
gold coin, guarded by. Paying^ Teller Wal
ter of the . First National Bank and as
sistants in ; the council chamber. It was
t,he purpose of the , company to deposit
10 per cent, of vthe figure 'bid and that
amount would; have been^ necessary ; had
the bids â¢ reached the maximum fixed by
the company of WOO.OOO. The: bid of $35,
431 30 was reached after an ; hour jof j hard
fighting "between the representatives, oC
the Home company of Alameda County;
and; Dr. Ferdinand Butterfleld of San
Francisco, who was bidding- for the Kel
logg system of telephony that has been
Installed In Los' Angeles. Judge J. G.
North represented the. Home
The council chamber was crowded by
interested J spectators ' and they frequently
Interrupted by applause. .When the bids
were called for by President Fitzgerald,
the -Home' company' put in' a sealed, bid
of $20,000. 'Immediately Delos Magee, a
San Francisco attorney, who said he rep
resented Dr. Butterneld of the Kellogg
manual system, raised the. bid 10 per cent,
making it $22,000. |gg
'' GOES'HIM A FPW BETTER.
"For the Home Telephone Company I
desire to raise the bid 10 per cent, or to
$24,500,'' said Judge North. '
"And for Dr. Butterfleld, I raise that
bldto $26,620," rejoined Magee. Each time
he. made a bid. Judge North advanced to
the clerk's table and; deposited: 10; per
cent of the amount In gold on the clerk's
desk, while Magee was depositing certi
fied cheeks." At th,is point Judge North
objected to. the bids of his competitor on
the ground that he did not deposit gold
coin, as he* contended the law required. :
â¢ There was a. heated discussion between
the attorneys' and City Attorney McElrpy
was called upon for an opinion. That of
ficial held that the Butterfleld checks met
the requirements, in that it was the suc
cessful j bidder who must make the final
deposit. ', v V*V
VThen, under protest against the meth
ods of our I competitor, I \u25a0 raise the bid â¢10
per .cent, making the amount $29,282,"
said Judge North, arid he again deposited
gold, coin. â¢':' '.'..'

to-morrow night . to accept the .Home

After the meeting Judge North de
clared that he expected competition and
declared' that the ; Bell Telephone f Com

in' reality the competitor. ; .
Under " the terms of ,the franchise the
new company must begin work on its
system within three months and s must
expend $550,000 in the city within three
years or forfeit Its franchise." \u25a0'â¢ It 7 must

URGES MERGING
OF LIBRARIES
J. B. Relnstein, the attorney, has ad
dressed \u25a0 the following letter to the mem
bers of the Mercantile -Library Associa
tion, urging that they give up the un
equal struggle to maintain the institution
and take advantage of the opportunity to
merge with the Mechanics' Institute:
Dear Sirs: The importance of the problem
now ConfrontinÃ the' Mercantile Library As
sociation warrants the thoughtful consideration
of all Its members. That consideration, it
seems to me, should - regard (1) the business
situation; (2) the side of sentiment: (3) the
obligations and the purposes of the association.
As to the first, it would Burely seem that
the . association cannot ~ hope to prosper finan
cially in the future, and that the library must
be sold or given away shortly under less ad
vantageous circumstances than the present.
. The past has demonstrated that, even with
earnest and loving efforts to place the library
on a sound financial basis, it has sio*ly lost
ground for many years; and the future hold*
no- hope of betterment, aa a sufficient prlTate
endowment seems to be. out of the question.
and It Is an axiom that a library cannot be
sustained , merely .by â¢. membership dues. On
business principles, - therefore, it would seem
to me that the library cannot exist long: and. \u25a0
aa its assets are dally decreasing; the sooner
such assets are disposed ; of , the better will be
the. result obtained. - : .>,â¢ . \u25a0\u0084 r ; .
â¢THG SENTIMENT, SIDE. .
Secondâ The sentiment side â No member of
this Association : who has been connected with
it long merely' as- a member, or Intimately by
reason of eflorts made In its behair. can fall to
I pel â¢ a desire that its existence should be con
tinued; and. though the age is a most practical
one. ruch' sentiment, In my Judgment, should
be given the fullest \u25a0 possible sway and influ
ence; but if the business situation preclude?.
A3 apparently.lt does, a separate existence. for
!thÂ« association, the best response to that sen
timent must be found in an existence bound up
with either the Public* Library or the Mechan
ics' Library. : Now, sentiment must connect It
self with identity and personal' relation; and
if the . library bj turned over to the public
that identity and that personal relation cease
to exist â¢ No member of this library will have,
or should have/* any different \u25a0 relation to the
Public Library ttan ' what eTery . citixen - has.
No member can have the slightest voice in the
management of the ' library from . the time the
city owns It. Whereas, -should it be turned
over -to the Mechanics' Institute, every one of
our member* will, during life, have not only
the use of. but a voice and .vote in the man
agement of a much larger and better Joint
library, possessing the combined advantages of
both and perpetuating .the name of each. â a
Joint library which would tx bettered and
strengthened by increased membership * and
tedded jiidrment in the direction of its affairs.
. Third â As to the fulfillment ft the obliga
tions of our association, every past obligation
to our members \u25a0- will be more than fulfilled In
this way: and this Is a moral, perhaps even,
r. legal duty "we owe. -->\u25a0â¢'\u25a0\u25a0'- \u25a0 -
NAME AND PURPOSE SAFE.
. As to the accomplishment of the purposes
of our existence, both the name of the Mercan
tile : Library- nnd -Ua purposes will be safe
guarded and perpetuated, not only by twice the
number of books and seven times ths ' number
of members and fifty times. the amount of our
asset's, but also- from the fact that the consti
tution, of the State provides that the president
of the Mechanics' Institute shall be ex-officio
a Regent of the .State University; so that by
our vote for ; such president k we elect a Regent
of the University, and have a voice, therefore,
.in the great influence and destiny of that com
manding institution. < That university, together
with the . Stanford University, â¢ have given our
State â though - among tbe youngestâ a . proud
position among the States of -our Union In the
matter. of higher education; and it would be a
source of equal pride and prestige to thÂ« city
of San" Francisco if, ; uniting our membership,
assets andTlnfluence with that of the Mechan
ics' Institute, we should make In this land far
from' the centers .of cultivation a private
library second \u25a0to none In the - United States
The time :is ; ripe : for such ; a combination. ; It
is an era' of great things due to -the aggrega
tion'of; capital and effort: and by this union,
springing \u25a0 from our., very adversities, we shall
not only better subserve all of the purposes of
our existence, but will add . fame and prestige
tc/the city of San Francisco. . -,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MENLO PARK. Dec. 4.â The threat
ened water famine in this district Is now
a thing of the oast. The conditions that
prevailed before the downpour of rain
have been productive of much .good and
a practical assurance that neither the
town nor its environs will ever be placed
In the predicament that faced them dur
ing the dry spell. In the first place, the
Bear Gulch .Water Company has decided
to enlarge Its plant at an expense that
.will .aggregate Beveral thousand dollars.
For some time the equipment of the com
pany has been inadequate, and not only
were the 'roads left thick with dust and
the beautiful gardens of the district left
neglected, but household consumers were
warned to be very careful In their use of
water.
When it became known that water was
extremely scarce here the Trustees of
Palo Alto took the^matter up and after
discussion with prominent residents here
practically decided to lay pipes into Men
lo Park. The plan appears to be an ex
cellent one and has already received sub
\ stantlal encouragement. If it 13 carried
Into effect, as it probably will be. It will
not only settle the fears of a water fam
l me once for all. but will Introduce here
a competing company, which Is always
very desirable. .

consumption in the last stages and
' ro . m 'Â«Â« symptoms.it probably was. I
naa nights sweats 4 hat took all ray
strength; I could hardly walk. I was so
\u25a0weak. I was reduced in flesh to almost
skin and bones â I coughed day and
night. I spit up blood and matter all
the time.. That loohs like consump-
tion. Well. I doctored and doctored. I
lived in the fresh air. I took cod liver
oil. but I kept on getting worse right
along.
More dead than alive. I got to the
I-lectro-Chemic Institute. 1 was put
.under this wonderful new treatment
and in two months I was perfectly
cured.
My picture heads this article. I live
at 527 Eddy street. San Francisco. My
name is Mrs. M. Macdougall. The
Klectro-Chcmic Institute, where I was
cured, is located in the Emma Spreckels
building at 927 Market street on the
third floor. lam happy, of course, that
I am cured. Then again the Electro
Chemic treatment is so pleasant to
take. It helps the sufferer from the
very beginning. The Electro-Chemic
physicians are kind and considerate. I
know that every patient is given the
most considerate attention, rich 01
poor; then the cost of the treatment is
so reasonable. My advice to all sufferers
Is to go at once to the Eleotro-Chemic
Institute before it is too late. Consul-
tation and examination is free and the
physicians of the Institute are honest
and will tell every one just what can
be done and such advice is free.

SHARP WILL
IN QUESTION
Contest Instituted Iby De
cedent's; Cousin Goes to
Trial Before Judge Coffey
SENSATIONS -ABE ABSENT
Day's Evidence Tails to De
velop Any Proof Against
Legality of the Testament
The contest of the will of the late
Honora Sharp instituted by Joseph O'Don
nell, a cousin of the deceased, is under
full swing in Judge Ooffey's court. The
contestant alleges unsoundness of mind
and undue influence, charging that these
conditions caused Mrs. Sharp to leave
$200,000 to Park Commissioners Lloyd and
Spreckels in trust for the erection of a
memorial entrance to Golden Gate Park
in honor of her beloved husband, who
passed from this world before her. The
same conditions, alleges the contestant,
caused Mrs. Sharp to leave $25,000 to
Madame Tojetti and other sums to other
friends, to the exclusion of the cousin,
who now assails her testament.
While the opening statement of con
testant's counsel was full of promises of
what would be shown, there was nothing
developed during the day to bear them
out. Instead of aiming at the mental
condition of Mrs. Sharp, counsel for the
contestant made a mild effort, to prove
that her sister, Mrs. Brennan, who died
many years ago, suffered from a clouded
intellect for come time. Judge Coffey,
however, promptly stayed the efforts of
the contestant along this line and smiled
blandly as counsel asserted that they held
that the mental condition of Mrs. Bren
nan might have strong bearing on the
mental condition of Mrs. Sharp.
Attorney wCharles S. Wheeler, repre
senting the. proponents, stated that such
a theory was entirely too remote to have
even a possible bearing on the issues,in
volved in the case at bar. Judge Coffey
said there was . no question as to the
soundness of this contention, ' and so
ruled. Counsel for the contestant took an
exception to the ruling.
Ellen C. Raickel, May W. Tricou and
Jennie C. Connor were the only witnesses
called during the,day. The first two could
offer no possible assistance to the con
testant, so they were soon dismissed, but
Mrs. Connor, in whose mother's home
Mrs. Brennan, sister of Mrs. Sharp, died, i
was questioned more fully.
It was â¢ through Mrs. Connor that the
contestant sought to . prove that Mrs.
Brennan was not of sound mind, and that
if she were not, held contestant's counsel,
it would be a circumstance favoring their
contention that Mrs. Sharp was also in
sane. But outside of the statement that
until her last illness, which was sudden,
Mrs. Brennan was in good health Judge
Coffey would not permit the witness to
go.
Mrs. Connor disposed of, the reading of
depositions establishing the contestant's
relationship were taken .up. These depo
sitions contained only the one material
factâ that O'Donnell was a cousin of the
deceasedâ though they ; occupied some
time in the reading.
More witnesses will be called this morn
ing, for what purpose the proceedings of
yesterday do not make entirely clear.

THE PHILIPPINE TRADE.
"-pHE Examiner is solicitous that San Francisco shall control
the trade with the Philippines, and that the trade should be
A enlarged by diverting to the United States a large part of. that
which jnow goes to China, Japan and Europe. So say we all. By
way of illustration the paper quoted cites the control of 95 per cent
of the trade of Hawaii by this city, under American occupation and
government, and wants to know why, under the same conditions,
a like percentage of the Philippine trade cannot be controlled?
The answer is that under like conditions it can be. The fault
is not any lack of enterprise on the part of our merchants and pro
moters. They controlled the trade of Hawaii long before American
occupation. They came into that estate under the kingdom. Their
enterprise was free to invest there, to produce and to factor their
products. They were unrestricted in the employment of laboi
suited to the tropical conditions of the islands. The reciprocity
treaty gave them free entry to our market for the great staple of
the country, and the right of acquisition and use of property was
not subject to limitations. The annexation of the islands' found
this condition and it has been fairly maintained since. The only
notable change is the lapse of the white American population and
an increase in the number and position of the native Hawaiians.
This change, however, has not affected our control of the trade,
which still remains in our hands and is of satisfactory volume.
The merest glance at the foregoing develops the reason why
we have no appreciable trade with the Philippines and why the to
tal trade of the United States with those islands is so small that it
could be lost entirely and not leave an impression on our total an
nual exchanges in commerce. The conditions that 'would permit
there what was done in Hawaii do not exist, and there is no indi
cation that they ever will. American occupation of the Philippines
is busy in educating the natives and in protecting them from ex
ploitation by the American spirit of commercialism. It is deter
mined that the country shall not be exploited" for profit by the
people of this country. Americans who have gone there expecting
a profitable business career retreat as soon as they can, pocketing
their experience and carrying their disappointment as well as the}'
may. The important trade of the Philippines remains placed where
it was under Spanish rule.
The difficulties of production have been increased by rigid re
striction as to the kind of labor that may be employed and the native
labor presents the same problem it always did â a problem common
to the people of all tropical countries. The best part of the trade
was in the hands of the English merchants of the Straits Settle
ments, and it is there yet. They take all of the gutta percha and
rubber and the commercial gums. England has a monopoly of
gutta percha. No ocean telegraph cable can be laid without it, and
'when our Government lays military cables in Alaskan waters it has
to buy of Great Britain the gutta percha raised in our own territory,
in the Sulu group of the Philippines. This happens through the
fear that American merchants will exploit the islands. for American
profit.
This statement of the conditions which exclude us from the
Philippines, and of the opposite conditions under which we ex
ploited Hawaii in the days of the kingdom and continue to control
its trade, is made not to impeach the wisdom that protects the Phil
ippines from American commercialism. It is the simple statement
of a fact. The woods and minerals and the products of the soil and
of the waters of the Philippines can enter into American commerce
in significant volume only when it is made profitable for Americans
to handle them, and that, under present conditions, is impossible.
This much needs to be said in defense of American commer
cial enterprise in general, and that of San Francisco in particular.
No fault is found with anybody. Our Government has mapped out
its policy in the islands and may not be expected to change it until
the time arrives when choice must be made between admitting them
as States in the Union, or giving them independence, autonomy and,
self-government under our auspices. When that -time comes their
admission as States will be found insufferable and the people of this
country will prefer anything to that. If they be given autonomy
we may get as much chance in their trade as our commercial rivals
who are now getting all the chance there is. ; ;?'> '\u25a0
FUNDS.
A SEMI-OFFICIAL statement of funds used in national cam
paigns is published. It goes as far back as the campaign of
1892, putting the fund used 'by the Democratic national com
mittee that year at $4,100,000. The amount seems to have reached
high water mark that year. In 1896 the Republican fund is put at
$3,800,000, in 1900 at $2,800,000 and in 1904 at $1,900,000.
The Democratic fund after 1892 is not stated. In 1896, how
ever, the fund at'the disposal of Mr. Bryan's committee was large.
He had many millionaire silver miners- with him, and men like.W.
A. Clark and the other silver kings are not "pinchers" in politics.
The steady decline in the amount of the Republican fund is account
ed for by the disappearance of the necessity for large expenditures.
The election of President Roosevelt was assured from the moment
of his nomination, and money was spent principally for the benefit
of the local and Congressional tickets in States that were thought
to be close. The result proved, however, that' the President would
have pulled the local tickets through without the spending of any
money. . }'^\*h
The wide publicity that is being given to the amount of cam
paign funds and their source is a good thing. It means that both
parties will still further curtail expenses, will need less money and
will be more scrupulous as to its. sources/", The civil service law
protects the employes. of the Government against political assess
ments. With corporations excluded as contributors, the campaign
fund of the future will be furnished^ by partisan enthusiasts, \u25a0 and
will be so small as to contradict the "statement that the voters are
bought. ' - . v \u25a0\u25a0;; ,~ "\u25a0\u25a0::

THE IMMORTALITY OF ANIMAL LIFE
To the Editor of The Call:
Why the declaration of Professor
Howlspn to the effect that all animal
life Is immortal should startle people
so seems strange, at least to those who
have read or thought much upon the
subject. Stop, for one. moment, and
imagine what sort of world it would be
without animals, birds, flowers, etc.
Education along these lines will re
move the fearof death; the agony of
parting. It will banish , the black
crape, the doleful black carriages; the
custom of wearing mourning for those
who have passed to the higher life, not
died, for there is no such thing as
death! It is said that, all animals fear
death; even insects will try to avoid
danger. Such is the truth, because self
preservation is the first law of nature.
Animals' reason. Of course they do.
It is . demonstrated every' day. Ele
phants; where used as beasts of burden,
show reason and almost human intelli
gence in stacking heavy timbersalong

Why not teach children that tue In
habitants of the spirltuul spheres or
heaven are the immortal or spiritual
part of human" beings who have lived
upon this or other planets? Teach them
that love is the tie that binds the" two
worlds. Did, not Christ say: "In my
father's house are many mansions"?
He did not mean material houses.
It .stands to reason that people
having simply dropped the mortal body
must have a 7 spiritual body /to corre
spond with their surroundings as do
mortals.. The spirit being the man him
self; naturally, desires to surround him
self'with his friends, his domestic
animal friends, as well as human.
\u25a0 Let; us be both reasonable and candid.
If we teach our children plain truths
as we understand: them surely that;is
better for them than shrouding every

Her Unfortunate Bargain
With the Drmnmer.
A few days ago Mme. Larivlere. who
lives on , a farm not far.,, from ' here, was
surprised 'by a well-dressed .man, who
came to . the , door with an eager | request
for a rifle,, says the Blue' Sea Lake' (Que
bec) correspondent of the New York Sun.
As .It happens, the only firearm her hu
sband possesses is an ancient,' wire-bround,
muzzle-loading shotgun.
i This _and . '"the accompanying powder
horn and cap box the excited visitor
quickly seized. A large charge of powder
.was rammed home, : a rifle cartridge lying
a s curiosity upon the little mantelpiece
supplied the bullet, and the gun was care
fully sighted and fired, to the great alarm
of the . lonely housekeeper. What In the
world the man with the store clothes and
'tho impressive golden chains was doing
she could not fathom.
. The shot was evidently satisfactory, for
the man replaced the gun, threw a whole
silver quarter upon the table; and,' with
a smiling { face, darted . from the cabin.;
From the window she saw him run to the
little barnyard, there pick up what; she
took to be^ the body >of a dead dog and
drag it down the road to where, below the
hill, a horse and buggy, were Btanding. : :

A TALK WITH MABYL.
You have now, my dear Mabyl, attained
that period in your youthful careerâ a pe
riod strangely coinciding with the time
when you Bhed the "c". in your name and
substituted a "y" for Itâ when you sadly
realize how : very commonplace â¢ and ple
beian your doting mamma is and how
much more you know. than she does. The
time has now arrived when you compre
hend . that that mamma's appropriate
place is in the . kitchen, and if you are
compelled to introduce her to your per
fectly lovely 'young man you afterward
say i to him, "Mamma is queer, but so
good!"" whereupon he ..sympathlzingly
says, "I . know; yes," I know, dear,'*: and
kisses away your, pain' and humiliation.
At last the time : has come : when' you
'pathetically . reali2e ; that : your \ â¢ mamma
does not -know a syllogism from a 'pork
roast, except as she sometimes suspects
that the former" is 'not intended . to eat'
Ah, what a hard and cruel day It was for
you, Mabyl. when first this shameful truth
dawned upon your developing mind, and
how eagerly you have attempted to con
ceal the bitter - realization within your
gentle, stricken, breast!
And yetâ lf you .will permit me, Mabylâ
some things may be said in favor of tho
"old : lady." She loved you and cared for
you when I, as a mere outsider, would
hardly have considered you worth the
chloroform to end it all. On many &' cold,
cold night she got up and walked the
floor with you when your warwhoop inti
mated that you had a pain in that little
inside; which your perfectly lovely young
man 1 never mentions: You -mentioned "it
then without any coy hesitation; but, of
course,; that was different. She did a
thousand and one menial things for you
which you never will realize until after
j-ou and the perfectly lovely young man
have ' been ' made one and you are doing
something of the kind for a wee stranger
within your gates.
Perhaps .this love, which ( was lavished
like water, this perpetual sacrifice which
heeded ' not itself, not be I counted
now, my dear girl,. but I : think that" they
should. ' Indeed, when I : contemplate the
love^of S that poor,* 1 commonplace mother,
as well ' as the . sacrifices that she ; meas
ured-not, it; seems to me that that care
worn -woman ' is worth about .tenrthou
sand of your foolish and ' trivial self. You
may : not â¢ believe it, Mabyl; and neither
does the perfectly lovely young man; but
such is my honest thought, nevertheless.
\u25a0And -if you can drop the butterfly for a
little time and seriously^. think of the
matter ! just as it stands, â¢ are you quite
sure,' Mabyl, that you will not agree with
me? " v

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
. THE.LADY OF* THE LAKEâ Reader.
City. In answer to the question, "Are the
plot and characters of Scott's 'Lady of the
Lake' real or imaginary?" ' the answer is
that the * only incident of fact on which
the poem is founded is that of the fond
ness of King James V of Scotland of go*
ing 'about Incognito among his subjects. ;
THE MACHlNEâ Subscriber, City. Tha
first use of "the machine" - &s ~ used in
politics, has been traced to Aaron Burr,
who is credited with having first used
the >, expression \u25a0 "The ; machinery oX a
party .V,. Hence, when .the organization
of a party falls into the hands of pro

to serve their own or their political pur
poses,- it is commonly known -as the

CAPTURES THE TOWN
Fires the \u25a0 Audience
to Highest Point
of Enthusiasm.
Football Game Is
Great Feature
of Play.
Now the football drama, the drama
tized halfback. Lionel Barrymore intro
duced the pugilist to polite society here;
last night George Ade. In "The College
Widow," turned tfce local lorgnette on
the halfback. "The College Widow." in
other words, came to the Columbia last
night, crammed the house, and fired the
audience to the cuy-throwing etage. An
undeniable hit is this last Ade to the
iira^ma, as good of its kind as his
If Couniy Chairman."
The comedy should be prescribed to all
intending students. Humorously, it Is
Â«juite likely that the later Plato would
rule It out of the college course. But
anything more attractive to the average
youth than Mr. Ade's Atwater College
jinks, with the football game, is hard of
imagining. Atwater la a co-educational
establishment, "lying east of Minnesota
and somewhere west of New York."
The four acts of the comedy take
place in front of Atwater's main ivy
covered building, at the faculty recep
tion in the gymnasium, on the athletic
neid (Thanksgiving day), and in front
of the local hotel. All of the college
types appear except the apparently ex
tinct "dig." There is- the "college
widow" herself, the president's daugh
ter; there are the female athleteâ a
gloriously buxom, tanned and copper
haired young person (Adeline Dunlap);
the landlady's dunning daughter, the
college chaperon and co-eds galore.
There ere the football coach, the train
er, the freshman, the "center rush,"
the "right tackle," the "halfback," the
freshman from Equantumville. his
papa, the halfback's papa, and a :
"Prex." There is a phantom faculty |
in the background, but it does not
count. Football reigns, and "the
gatne" is the thing.
The Btory is all about how Atwater
cheats the rival college of its halfback.
The halfback. Billy Bolton. unwarily
wanders into Atwater College on his way
to Bingham. He there falls under the
l^xpcrienced spell of the "college widow,"
Y*ho nas consented thus to sacrifice her
self. How he then decides to stay at
Atwater and saves "the game." and how
the pretty widow is herself caught in
her own toils, is the rest of it.
Mr. Ade's types mleht have been picked
up right out of college; his lines are
Ade'E best, and the thing goes with a
swing throughout.
The piece could hardly be better acted
anywhere. Truly, it requires mostly only
a lot of nice girls and youths to be as
nice as they are. And these are. Miss
Dorothy Tennant, of San Jose, is the
"college widow." Miss Tennant, last
here with Robert Edeson in "Soldiers of
Fortune," has distinctly advanced. She
is just the cool, fluffy, handsome, charm
ing young woman the role requires.
Adeline Dunlap is the athletic girl, a
wonder at clang and capital every way.
So is Katherine Nugent. Miss Nugent Is
the Flora -Wiggins, the landlady's daugh
ter, upon whom Mr. Ade has bestowed
the most of his best lines. Her "You
don't get foundered at a faculty recep
tion" met with a mighty snort. And Miss
Nugent's Miss Wiggins' way of asking,
"Will you kindly remember who and what
I am?" is classic. Remember the name.
'Nugent"; it will be heard of againâ even
here. Miss Llda McMillan is the chaperon
and all-sufficient.
The hero. Bolton. has most things done
fcr him, but as Frederick Truesdell plays
him ht- fills the eye and the role with
equal satisfaction. Mr. Truesdell looks
particularly fit when he perspires, luck
ilyâthey bring him on very much that
way at the end of the game on their
shoulders, great excitement.
The men are all good, Walter Walker,
it robust and genial Hiram Bolton; Edgar
I Laletcad, in a capital bit as a tutor;
VLaymond Chase, a truly comic freshman; ;

The large audience that attended the

comical situations In the ever green
farce comedy. "ThÂ» Private Secretary."
Each member of the company seemed
peculiarly suited to the character repre
cented. and the result was most satisfy
ing. James Neill had the title role and
Frank McVickers represented* Mr. Cat
termole. Miss Mlna Crollus Gleason was
Miss Ashford, the enthusiast on spiritual
ism. Orral Humphreys appeared as
Douglas Cattermole. John D. O'Hara as
Gibson, the tailor, kept himself within
bounds in the drunken scene.

Edith Evelyn had a star part at the
Alcazar last night, that of Phlllppa Dray

lenrietta Crosman. and it must be con
ceded that Miss Evelyn looks well In
tights. She has to wear them during the
whole of one act, and she walks like a
man and fences like a soldier besides.
All the other parts are subordinate In

noticeable. It was conducted with as con

The. mounting of the piece was gorgeous

evening, and a large audience enjoyed
the fun supplied. The programme con

The melodrama, "After Midnight," was

HOSPITAL
HOUSE CHIEF
IS ACCUSED
Grave Scandal Involves City
and County Institution
for Sick Poor and Health
Board Will Hold Inquiry
Mrs. Eva Morrison Declares
Dr. Turnbull Insulted Her
When Drunk and Took Coin
to Give Her Extra Care
Mrs. Eva Morrison yesterday swore to
an affidavit before Notary Public A." J.
Henry in which she' alleges! that Resident
Physician Walter Turnbull Jr. of the City
and County Hospital has been ' guilty of
conduct which, if her : statements are
true, marks him as a man who is a' dis
grace bo.th to the profession to which he
belongs and to the city under whose suf
ferance he is allowed to direct the medi
cal affairs of a great puhlia' lnstitution?.',
So serious are the woman's charges that
the Board of Health will make an imme
diate investigation of the affair. The al
legations, were made to one of the mem
bers of the board,* Dr. William A. Har
vey, yesterday afternoon, and he stated
that if they were found to be < true upon
investigation Dr. Turnbull would * be dis
missed at once. The\ investigation prom
ises to be highly interesting to the pub
lic at large, for rumors have been preva
lent during the last year that the City
and County Hospital has been very poor
ly managed and that \u25a0 disgraceful acts
there have not been infrequent.
Most serious of all the charges of this
woman is the sworn statement that on
Wednesday night Dr. Turnbull came into
a small room -in which she lay. at the
hospital and there made an indecent pro
posal to her. She declares that she in
dignantly refused, and that he lay down
upon her bed and tried to go to sleep. It
was with difficulty that she at last forced
him to leave the room. At that time she
was suffering from a wound In her scalp
made, she swears, by a surgeon who was
either lacking In knowledge or was un
able to properly perform the operation
necessary.
GIVEX A PRIVATE ROOM.
On top of this she swears that when
she first arrived at the hospital she was
given a private room and the best of at
tention, but after she" had rejected Dr.
Turnbull's indecent proposal she was re
moved to the ward,' her wound left with
out any attention one whole day and her
self served with food which she could
not eat -\u25a0';.\u25a0â¢' s -
Then, she swears; . because her friends
Interceded with Dr. Turnbull and insisted
that he give her better treatment she
was sent away from the hospital yester
day afternoon, when she was *in no fit
condition to leave. She states that Dr.
McPike, an interne in the hospital, told
her that she should not go away for at
least five days, and yet she was told by
the nurse, that she must go yesterday aft
ernoon.
: i Immediately' after "her departure . from
the City and County Hospital, ' Mrs. Mor
rison went to Dr. Harvey to have her
wound examined. ; Dr. Harvey j told her
that under no usual conditions should
she have been ordered out of the City
and County Hospital. He advised her to
go to a private hospital at once, as her
wound was far from being in a safe con
dition.
On top of the statements ,of Mrs. Mor
rison comes the i sworn affidavit of a
friend who had interested himself in the
case. This man swears before Notary
Henry that he gave a certain sum of
money to Dr. Turnbull with the under
standing that Mrs. Morrison should have
better treatment than was given to the
ordinary patient. He swears that " Dr.
Turnbull took the money, and when Mrs.
Morrison arrived at the hospital saw that
she was operated upon Immediately and
then placed her in a private room in the
maternity ward.
SAY TURNBULL DRINKS.
With this sworn testimony of Mrs. Mor
rison and her friend comes "the state
ments of people who live In the vicinity
of the City and County Hospital. They
state that Dr. Turnbull, as well as Other
surgeons about the hospital, is -in J the
habit of getting drunk while on duty and
Is often , carried ' into the hospital in \ a
senseless condition. It was only a short
time ago,: they say, that \u25a0 Dr. ; Turnbull
was in such an Intoxicated condition in
a saloon near the hospital * that two of
his fellow surgeons were forced to carty
him out, and. in doing so they burst the
doors of the saloon. They . openly state
that at times Dr. Turnbull's language
has been so vile that women have left the
room where he has been In disgust. .
The story told by Mrs.; Morrison of the
alleged attack on her is as follows:
I was Buffering from an abscess on the head.
Just above the ear. . My physician*, Dra. W.
CLC L Haasler ano W. A. . Harvey, f told me I must
go to a hospital -immediately; and; be operated
upon lest tflood poisoning should set in. Hav
ing no money to pay for treatment at a. prlva.t.9
hospital. I went to the City 'and County Hos
pital. ' In the meantime & friend |of mine | had
telephoned to Dr. Turnbull to see that I was
given the beet of everything. *
I arrived at the hospital on Tuesday even
ing and was operated on Immediately by a
young doctor . named Albe. 111 1 believe. :â¢ He cut
above the 1 abscess. That night and the next
day I was well attended . to, Dr. Turnbull
dressing the wound. ;. . â¢ . â¢ â¢ - â¢
MAKES INDECENT PROPOSAL.
It was on Thursday night that Dr. Turnbull
entered the room where I was lying and began
to talk with me. He was In a fearfully In
toxicated condition â¢ and made an indecent pro
posal to me. I would not \u25a0 listen \u25a0to > him ! and
ordered him out. He then . put his hands on
:my body . and \u25a0 laid down , and tried to go ' to
sleep In that position. f I ordered: him to leave
and he finally went out.t i \u25a0 \u25a0- . \u25a0 , . , â¢
The next day my, wound went without dress
ing. Dr Turnbull came-; in : again : In an in*
toxlcated condition and ; drank \u25a0 from a bottle of
whisky, for which he had made; requisition i In
my name. ; Ttie next day I was removed from
the private room to ' ward j H and there given
food which I* waB=. unable i to : eat/ The bread
was not ' buttered * and . the ; rest ' of the food was
so i hard and dry . that I could > not \u25a0 eat It. , In

a little Jelly "which, a ; woman :in the- next cot

An amended complaint will be filed with
the County Clerk this morning in the case
of â¢ Elfln O. and ,J, J Moodie O. * Heydenf eldt
and Sunshine ,O. â¢ Love against -James B.
Brooks, Nellie Clark,' Frank^McEwen and
F. A. Chapius, charging^ the t defendants

Company through its : agent,- James B.

It is stated in the ; complaint that
Brooks, who is "a real .estate agent,
handled the business of the ; late
Solomon Hedyenfeldt ;.for>, several 'years,
and that upon the death of the Judge he
became the confidential , friend : and 9 ad
viser of the heirs. Brooks then ; per
suaded them that the property could be
handled much better if a: company 'were
formed. Shortly; thereafter he .incor
porated under the name of the; Peninsula
Investment Company, of which;' he : was
made a director. It is at this 'time that
the alleged fraud Business
grew fro^m bad' to worse and all attempts
to sell the property were vain., " ', .
Finally Brooks announced that he had
found a rich widow in; thfe person of Mrs.
Nellie Clark who would purchase the
property at a stated sum. The deeds
were drawn up, but before the â¢ money
was turned over the woman sold the lot
on the corner of Geary "and .Webster
streets for' $9500, or an advance, 0f ; 52500
above the price to be paid by the com
pany. The mortgage of . $28,000 oni the
Howard and Eighth streets property was
transferred from the : Hibernia Bank 'to
the German Bank, and an additional
mortgage of $3500 was taken by F. -A.
Chapius. This, with the payment' of , ah
additional $1000, made; it f possible for
Brooks to have the transfers made ''in
favor of the Clark woman, who in . turn
transferred her whole interest to. Frank
McEweh, : who occupies 1 the j same I office
with Brooks and is his confidential friend.
/It was later discovered that ; the Clark
woman. was a Bervant at the Hotel Savoy,
and*, upon taking her deposition It was
found that she had simply allowed her
name to be used to accommodate Brooks
and McE wen, the latter being. a 'particu
lar friend of hers. McEwen stated In his
deposition that Brooks had asked^hlm . to
buy the property and had volunteered to
finance the deal. He knew nothing, as to
how the deal was financed except that
the property was deeded | over .- to him,
but th 6 deeds were never ' recorded. ;â¢ \u25a0;
The case is on thÂ« calendar of Judge
Sea well and was set. for to-day, but ow
ing to the absence of the ; Judge from
town it will probably not be reached be

PRESIDENT DISCUSSES
FOOTBALL ONCE MORE
"Billy" Reid and Herbert
White of Harvard At
tend a Conference. -
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â Among Presi
dent Roosevelt's guests at luncheon to
day, were Dr.- William T. Reid Jr., head
coach of the : Harvard football â¢ squad,
and' Herbert White, connected with . the
Athletic 'Association of the same institu
tion. ; "
At the beginning of the football season,
whlch'came to a close last Saturday, the
President had a - conference with Dr.
Reid, Walter Camp and several other au
thorities v on the game, with a view . to
such v modification* of the rules .as would
eliminate \u25a0 its brutal" features and prevent
slugging ; so far ' as possible .And at the
same * time ; bring about more open play.
It was too late at that time to make any
changes in the \u25a0 rules for the present sea
son,'but the coaches , promised to use
their : influence to -prevent unnecessary
brutality by -teams with which they were
connected and to consider, in the light of
developments, changes "in the rules of the
game. - : ..
> The conference to-day, which was com
paratively brief, enabled the President to
get the benefit of the observations of Dr.
Reid and White 'during the season, just
closed. While . nothing was disclosed .re
garding the details or the conference.; It
is stated that no conclusions of a definite
character were reached. The President
is anxious that, the game of football as a
college sport: should- not; be abandoned,
but '", he : strongly favors ; a ' modification of
the ' rules ; along . the lines ; indicated. Un
less i brutality^ and danger ' to ; the : lives of
the players Is reduced materially, ha real
ires j that ; the] sport ! Is practically doomed.
The ; President Is conferring: personally
and \u25a0> by.', letter . with > football authorities,

ACADEMIC BODY ACTS
Fate of. Gridiron Sport De
pends on tlie Eesult of
the Professors' Meeting
BERKELEY/. Dec. 4-â Football as
played by the students of the University
of California must be radically changed
or abolished as a college game. This la
the dictum of the academic council of"!
the university as the result. of a meet
lngr held last Wednesday night, the coun
cil's action having Just been mado public
by the university authorities.
A conference is to be held by the ath
letic committee of the faculty with a
similar faculty committee from Stanford
<at which the changes necessary to tÂ»
made In the style of play will be thor
oughly discussed. If this joint commit-
I *cc can agree upon a satisfactory revision
of the same of a character satisfactory
to the controlling powers of the StatÂ«
University."" the -game will continue. It
no such agreement is reached, and It
appears that the revision of rules de
sired cannot be made, an edict will issue
sounding- the death knell of football as
a sport recognized by the State Univar
sity. 3BMM
The academic council believes the Pa
clflc Coast colleges are competent to pre
pare and enforce their own football rule*
independent of any action that may bÂ«
taken by the football powers in the East.
It is believed that if California and Stan
ford unite in adopting rules the minor
institutions of learning of the coast
where football is played will fall Into
line and regulate their contests in ac- '
cordance with the bigger institutions'
policy. '
President "Wheeler said to-day he had
not intended the action taken by thÂ»
academic council should be generally
known at this time, but as reports had
been circulated more or less authentic
he dictated the following statement re- <.
garding the matter:
The academic council at a meeting last 7
"Wednesday called upon the athletic committee
of the faculty to make a full report of the
present status of the game, vrith recommenda
tions concerning the future attlude of the.
university with regard to it. Since that meet-
Ing President Jordan and myself have agreed
to a conference between the athletic commit
tees of the two universities. looking towan* a
later conference with experts and authorities
regarding the game. . We shall be prepared to
have this later meeting take up the work, if
found necessary, of reorganising the rules so as
to construct a game for our own use. Â« \u25a0
Football on the Pacific Coast has freed itseir
already of many of the evils which have at
tended it In other localities, notably In the
Middle "West. In some respects we have never
known these evils. sucW as extreme specializa
tion'and professionalism.:. We have some rea
son, looking at It from this point of view, for
moving ahead and providing a game for our
selves. It , may be found difficult or .impos
sible -to agree on a standard of game to ba
played. In that case there will be but one sim
ple and direct procedure and that is to. strike

MOULTON" IS FOR FOOTBALL.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 4. â
Trainer Dad Moult on of Stanford Uni
versity to-day stated the assertions at
tributed to him In regard to the elimi
nating of football were misconstrued.
He does not believe the great game is
to be completely done . away with.
Rather, .it Is his opinion the sport will
lons continue to be the most popular
of Intercollegiate athletics, but that the
rules will and must be modified.
In answering the objection raised by
some of the enemies of the game that
the number of men engaged in the
sport was not. representative of tha col
lege, , and that many were debarred
from participation in university ath
letics because of this fact. Moultqn j
states this is not the case. At . leasts
100 men. the heaviest and most husky
in the university, will be allowed to en
gage. This leaves many other athletic
branches open for the remaining stu
dents. Baseball, rowing. . track, tennis
and basketball* are in his estimation
ample field for recreation among all
collegians.
If the rules are to he modified the
veteran trainer Is at a loss to say what
would be inserted and "what eliminated
from, the present code. Open play has,
as ;he is , ready - to prove- by statistics,
caused more 'serious injuries than the
popular mass playing. As all . suggest
ed * modifications point to a change in
this direction some other point must bo
attacked.
"Prep school football must he cut
out.".; declares : Moulton. "The young
sters are .sufficiently matured to
stand, the* hard knocks and severe
training.- "It is largely the Injuries
of these high school lads that have
caused the comment and discouraxe
ment of the sport by university presi
dents." .- WKse

Manchuria Due To-
Day With Many
Notables
Among the^passengcrs who arrived here
jesjerday from Australia on the liner So
noma were Captain Watts and Chief Of
ficer Felix Stinson of the ill-fated Ameri
can ship Susquehsnna, the story of whose
foundering- and the subsequent escape of
all hands has already been told. The Sus
quehanna left Nehoue. in Xew Caledonia,
on August 23 with a cargo of chrome ore
for Delaware Breakwater. The cargo
proved too heavy for the clipper's wooden
buli, and when the Susquehanna encoun
tered a heavy gale three days out her
back broke in two places. By the time
the pumps were rigged the water in the
hold was flvc feet deep. Slowly the water
gained. The pump shaft carried away
and it was all off with the Susquehanna.
Three boats were manned and launched.
When the last boat shoved off there was
eeven feet of water in the well and
twelve feet in the forepeak. Before the
beats were many lengths from the ship
ehe took a dive and went head first to
the bottom.
In Captata Watts' boat were ten people.
Eleven got away in the mate's boat, and
Second Mate Griffin's boat carried ten.
Among those in the captain's boat were
Mr. and Mrs. Elwell. Elwell was mate
cf the Roanoke. sister ship to the Sus
<juehanna, which was burned at Noumea.
The boats headed for the Solomon Isl
ands, and after seven days' cruising the
captain's boat was picked up by. a trading
â¢.chooner.' which picked up the mate's
beat the day after. The second mate
landed on one of the Solomon Islands and
the. .shipwrecked sailors wgr-e kindly
treated until their supply of tobacco
gave out, when the son of a chief warned
OrifSn that 1/ he and his mqp did not
want to be eaten by the head-hunters of
his tribe they had better leave the island.
They left and were picked up by a trader,
\u25a0rhSdl landed them at Gabuta. where they
found the rest of the Susquehanna's com
pany. They went from there by steamer
to Sydney, where everybody went his
own way.
The Susquehanna was abandoned 250
miles off the coast of New Caledonia,
end the ship's company in the small boats
traveled about jOO miles. . *"' * .

" Story of Lives of Wliite
Men Away; in the Far East
GERMANS LOVE TO -WOKK
Dr. Thomas Day Gives Vivid
: Word Picture of Teutons'
Thoroughness in Labor
Professor E. A. TTlcher, D. D., of San
Francisco Theological Seminary, former-,
ly minister -of the -American V church at
Kobe, ' Japan, ; addressed^ the ' Occidental
Board of Foreign Missions yesterday aft
ernoon. Mrs. Cyrus | S. -Wright presided.
.Dr. -Wicher in speakin'gfof the religious
needs ; of the white communities in the
Far East said: .
. There has * been .' one great ' deficiency in the
missionary enterprise of the Christian church.
It 'has failed to provide for. the religious needs
of; the \u25a0 large, white -communities which have
grownup east- of Singapore.
\u25a0They, are notgtisually^constdered legitimate
objects . of . foreign" missionary activity . because
they are not heathen; and they are not. within:
the - sphere of the home mission boards be
cause they are not In r the home lands.
-Among the 100.OC0 -whites In the Far East,
not including India, there are no : poor. The
white man. Is : always a ,Vdonnasen"~ gentle
man, and a man of. the most- Important affairs.
His life is the most luxurious In the world.
Their homes are palatial and, moreover. -. every
white' man in ' the ' eyes of the native is a
Christian. . â¢ "
j i What i kind " of a : Christian, I â¢ would ask ? t '
i The whole story cannot be told In a public
gathering like the * present, but -some. things
can, be mentioned.- â - .\u25a0 .
In many most , influential - circles in the
'Orient j there Is no . prejudice whatever against
the young or old white man having a native
mistress and sometimes more than on*. \ ' .--.
~ There Is an abnormal consumption of wine
by the white men. and 'many 'young men who
have been reared in frugal and godly Ameri
can homes .become v grossly dissipated in the
temptations of their new surroundings. .
This Is far from applying to all white men
In the Par East, for'somt'of the best "and
most Christian men I have I ever known are
merchants there, v - . \u25a0â¢ \u25a0
' What Is to be done?. These men are without ,
religious ordinances. There should be a chap
lain appointed to every white community. Thlg
can only be accomplished through the--.com-'
mon action of all the Protestant churches of
America. . '" . .' . â¢ '.'.-\u25a0
The money will not be ' the most Important
consideration in . the establishment of * a sys
tem of chaplaincies. Tor most of the support
would-be found directly.* on the ground If the
right- men s were i sent. But the American
churches must nevertheless take the Initiative
and assume the ultimate responsibility."
â¢At the . close of Dr. Wicher's address
Miss Jennie. Cartridge moved and it Was
resolved; to petitfon.the council of mission
boards of America to take action in the
direction indicated. .' - :"'-.., 'Â»
- : Dr. Thomas |F. Day of the San Fran
"cisco Theolosical Seminary gave a' de
scription of his recent travels through
Germany before 1 the -Presbyterian " minis
ters' meeting at 920 Sacramento street
yesterday morning.'- :
Dr. Day paid many compliment*- to the.
thrift and sterling merits of the German
nation. They are. all workers, said he,
and love to labor. Every man,- whether
professional man. tradesman or \u25a0 working
man, |is determined jto do his 16 vel best
to attain the very highest standard in his
calling. '
The Germans may be slower In their
output than are the \u25a0* Americans, but
everything has an ideal, finish. No mat
ter what the objeeCit is artistically com
pleted." â¢ ;'- v .'- : '..'' 1 .- --Â»â¢:â¢ *v. \u25a0'.;â¢;.-*â¢ i.
America,' said Dr.' Day, has'a good deal
to learn from' the German's idealism and
combination of law and -HbeVty. ' And, he
said. Germany can , learn â¢ much from the
United' States an to breadth of "outlook
and versatility in the practical conduct
6f life. -.; .â¢;\u25a0; \u25a0
'He gave a graphic account "of .the an
cient and \u25a0 beautiful 1 cities, and his de
scription of Rbtheriburg with its old walls'
still standing save his rfudience the great
est delight, r.
' Dr. Day \ lingered for* some time on his
description ojf the "great monument 'of
Martin LuthÂ«'r. at \u25baWorms. His woi^ pic
tures 6i the Rhine and parts df HWland
were vividly' trueVto nature. / -'

*i: ,v. .-d much furtiier unbettiement to-day ;un-
Ctr the continued influence of thÂ« widening of
KuKUan disturbances and our own tight money
market. As the day progressed these Influ
ences seemed to lope their lorce for a time and
xtocks recovered their losses. The upward
movement of the latter dealings was desultory
*nd spotty In the last degrÂ«Â«. The high grade '
railroad stocks and thÂ« better known Indus
trials played a email part In the movement and
â¢speculative actl\lty was diverted again in a
marked degree to stocks of a minor _ grade.
*->--peclsily non-dividend paying industrials.
"Money continued in rather scant supply and
leaned above fc per cent from the outset. Some
â¢of the forces of depletion of hank reserves
w< ; re stiH tn operation. But since the specula
tion has m'eatfcered a 23 per cent money rate
thie fall -without serious detriment the specula
tive eemim^nt seemed to lean to the conviction
Uiat Friday's 15 per cent rate might safely

somewhat relaxed to-day. The bank* are los

TJirain. N-ew York exchange at Chicago, how

the 10-cent discount rate ruling on Saturday.
The money market probably wa? affected also
fey Rome return in the way of dividend apd in
twej* diibursemtnts of the rums accumulated
Srir the December 1 settlement. Sterling ex
*--fcante rates declined, especially In that
market being r<>rlentsh*<f by bankers' finance
bills, tne proceeds ,of which went out into our
â¢money market. The discounts declined in Lon
don in epite of the sharp turn in the Conti
nental exchanges against London. The move
* rnent oT sterling exchanjre at Paris wat partic
ularly marked. That financial center has to
b*af the brunt of the disorderly condition* of
Russian finance. The slump In Russian Gov- '
ernment bonds was -reflected In free liquidation

ANOTHER WONDERFUL ;
CURE BY CUTICURA
"Ko tongue can tell how I suffered

Ing eczema, until I was cured by the
Cuticura Remedies, and I am so grate-
ful I want the world to know, for what
helped me will help others. My body
and face were covered -with sores.
One day it would seem to be better,
and then break out again with the
most terrible pain and itching. I have
been sick several times, but never in
my life did I experience such awful
suffering as with this eczema.' I had
made up my mind that death was near
at hand, and I longed for that time
when I would be at rest. I had tried
many different doctors and medicines
without . success, and my mother
brought me the Cuticura Remedies,
insisting that I try them. I began to
feel better after the first, bath . with
CuUcura Soap, ajid one application of
Cuticura Ointment. I continued with :
the Soap and Ointment, and have
taken four, bottles of Cuticura Resolv-
ent, and consider myself well. Any
person having any doubt about this
wonderful cure by the Cuticura Rem-
edies can write to my address. Mrs.

BUILDING'S REAR
CRASHES DOWN
Tliree Women and Child in
Upper Story Eallv With
the Snapping Timbers
FOUNDATION WEAKENED
Structure on Golden Gate
Avenue Gives Way Because
of Excavations Beside ! It
The supporting joists weakened by ex
cavation and the foundation shaken by
the earthquake of Sunday morning, the
rear half of a building at 413 Golden Gate
avenus collapsed yesterday afternoon at
4:50 o'clock and ffrll with a crash into the
vacant lot adjoining. The front part list
ed to on* side, but was saved by props.
Three women and a child were in the up
stairs part that fell, while a dozen men
working In the lot next door and in the
coal yard of Sturdivant &.Co., which oc
cupied the ground floor of the damaged
builfllng, barely escaped with their Hve6.
The women In the house were badly bruised
and suffered from . shock. That no one
was killed is deemed marvelous when
one inspects the ruins of that part of the
building they were In when the crash
came.
The vacant lot next to the ruined house
is being excavated by Contractor L. B.
Slbley, who has a contract to erect an
automobile garage. The occupants of the
house. say that the work was carelessly
done, no support being given the build
ing at 413 Golden Gate avenue. It was
occupied by Mrs. C. H. Edwards, her
mother and Mre. J. Bolten. The three
women, and Mrs. Edwards' little boy,
George, aged 5 years, were eating supper
at the time of the collapse. Without a
warning sound the rear of the house, de
void of all support, trembled violently
and then fell, the dining-room, in which
the family was seated, toppling down.
WOMEXARE RESCUED.
The crashing of timbers, coupled with
the screams of the ' women, brought
many people to the scene of the accident.
Frank Schrlek, foreman for Sturdivant &
Co., and A. Mounday and Paul Venezula.
mindless, of their own danger, rushed
into the- ruins and extricated the women
and child. Mrs. Edwards was pinioned
beneath a folding bed, but was not. se
riously hurt. ;Her daughter J had been
strlck forcibly by a flying lounge, and the
child and -Mrs. Bolten had been cut and
bruised by flying bric-a-brac. The injured
and frightened women were removed to
the house of O. M. Marsh at 415 Golden
Gate avenue, where, they were cared for.
Mrs. Edwards says that they were
taken by surprise. They heard the groan
of timbers, felt the tremble of the build
ing and the' next moment were being
hurled across the room, articles of air
descriptions being thrown around them.-
A cocker , spaniel \u25a0 belonging \u0084 to little
George was in the room, but got lost in
the shuffle. It isr believed to have been
killed. Mrs. Edwards was prevented,
from going back into the ruins in search
of the canine.
WORKMEN JUST ESCAPE.
Several men in the lot where the exca
vating was being done were just quitting
work when the building came down. They
rushed to places of safety Just in time to
avoid being crushed beneath a weight of
broken timber. Bookkeepers H. Nash and
N. Hoburn, who were in the coal yard of
fice, were thrown across It by the sudden
shifting of th&t part of the building, but
were -unhurt.
The police, under Lieutenant McManus
of the City Hall station, were soon on
the ground and maintained order, and
kept the curious away from the danger
line. Truck 3. in charge of-. Captain
Schultz of the Fire Department, was
called". out, it being thought that some
one was buried in the ruins. Assured
that all were safely out of the building,
the. police and firemen propped . the re
maining portion of the house toyprevent
it falling. They were assisted by Con
tractor M. F. Sullivan, who loaned tim
bers for the work and supervised their
erection. . .
The damaged house is the property of
Miss Lottie P. Farnsworth. The occu
pants of -the house are wroth at Con
tractor Sibley and say they will sue him
for damages.

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Where the rear of the Emporium 'abuts
on Stevenson street/ between Fourth and
Fifth, there is a long and wide sidewalk
grating through which soars .. a genial
warmth from the . basement, : in.; which
electricity is generated for the big depart
ment store. It was there that [Patrolmen
Meyer and Hobi | dlsc'ove/ed I and arrested
ten able-bodied male tatterdemalions last
Saturday night and booked them for va
grancy. " />
. According to the narrative of the police
men, which was not* contradicted in any
essential point by ; the defendants, the
outer atmospheric temperature was pierc
ingly chill, . and the ; loungers | upon ! the
grating might have \u25a0 been moved lon In
stead of arrested if they had simply been
heating their" inadequately , clad bodies
and limbs. But they were holding revel.
Stretched prone, like so many herrings
upon a gridiron, they ihibibed steam beer
from' tin cans and interchanged' ribald
badinage and croaked unprintable ditties.'
Some of them were provided with gunny
bags, which they utilized as coverings, 1
this obviating necessity of turning over
as soon as their underside was sufficient
ly warmed. Those not so equipped were
constantly wriggling and } squirming \ arid
rolling to bring the cold portions of their
anatomy in contact with the hqat. But
all. were drinking freely and contributing
to the flow of persiflage. >. :,

Nellie' Henry told her,' story., yesterday
to a jury, and Judge Buck of San Mateo,
sitting in vj.this city, in her suit for
$50,000 \u25a0damages for. breach jof promise.
'Miss .'Henry/was the; nrst and, only

Ing of her. counsel. Attorney Whitmore,
she told the story of her alleged relar

She -testified thus: / x -
'': I i was I born â¢; In \ San Francisco In 1868 and
have spent my -whole life here. My father died
twenty \u25a0 years rago â¢ and â¢ since that time . I " have
worked , and ':- assisted In . ' the - support .of :my
mother, '\u25a0 with ' whom I have always made my
home. â¢ I have known: Mr. \ Whlttler fourteen or
fifteen years.; 1 ; I- met '.him 'at the. home of a
Mrs.' Harrison, -252 \u25a0 Hyde' street. He was in
troduced to me as a Mr. Hyde and I did "not
know; his true j name | until we became engaged
almost' a year afterward. '.'., \u25a0
At my home one , evening? Mr." Whlttler told
me that he Joyed me and;, wanted me to.be hiÂ«
wife. :. He; kissed.m e and .-gave, me a. ring.
'.'That,"- he said, "rasans that you are mine."
He took the rinft. which was set with a small
diamond.' from a little box lined with pink cot
ton.' As to our being married,, he "said that we
should wait : until his children were all mar
ried, adding \u25a0 that 7 if . they did ; not get married
soon he . would â¢ wed me any way. \u25a0 v :
: TELLS OF THE JILTING.
\ The first time I realized that we were not to
get . married A was ,in March, â¢ 1903. when he
came to our house at 123 Page street. He said
that his ulster wanted him to remain single on
account, of his children and he ', had 'decided
that such was for the best. 'Hs left the house
that afternoon and I never saw i him again. ,- ; ;
- I have never â¢. been 'happy since that day. >I
have I been . miserable. | ,- My young ( life |is past
and I had never kept company with any. other
man. H I think I : have heart trouble as a result
of his. leaving me. \ ; \u25a0 ' -\u25a0 \u25a0 ' - ~. :
â¢ :\u25a0 During our .engagement Mr. Whlttler \u25a0 gave
me present?. V Among . them were a watch fob,
boxes of candy, a ?au gold piece and -bottles of
perfumery at Christmas. He â¢ also bought the
furniture . for a bedroom for me and had the
room carpeted: .He wrote me many letters.-. but
I .have nothing now, but some of the envelopes
In- which they came.- I gave- the letters them
selves to 'Attorney Montelth. who formerly rep
resented me. When he dfcsd Mr.' Macbeth took
his business and; in- the confusion the- letters

fendant. She- admitted.' that \, whop she
ifrst met .Whittier she was a masseur,
and' that' she rubbed ; the capitalist's arms
to relieve him of his rheumatic troubles.
These 'treatments, she further, testified,
had been administered by her on fre
quent occasions during their entire ac
quaintanceship. She was positive, howâ
ever.^lhat many of Whittier;s visits to
her home ': were : for the sole purpose of;
seeing her and \ "keeping company," as .
